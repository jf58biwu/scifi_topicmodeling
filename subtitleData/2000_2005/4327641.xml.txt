 Full house . I will give you the part . That was for a ' 69 Charger , no ? There . No charges , OK ? Please , just go . Take me with you . Sorry , man . Here , kid . So , you see , by applying the basic principles ... of the scientific method to the matter ... we learn very quickly that the myth of the Chupacabra ... is just that ... utter crap . Now , if you apply these same principles to Catholicism ... an interesting thing occurs . Yes ? " English for immigrants " is in el proximo cuarto , numero 206 . So , anyone else have a question ? OK , then . Well , I hope my lecture has been as enlightening for all of you as it has for me . Really , you 've all been ... great . Interesting lecture as always , Dr. Venture . I am only sorry there wasn 't a better turnout . It 's difficult to hold the students ' attention during Dia de los Muertos . Oh , right ... the crazy dead-people Christmas you people celebrate . What , is that supposed to be today ? Si . Oh , great . Fantastic of you to tell me that before I came all the way down here . So , how do we do this ? Do you guys mail me a check , or do I pick it up at the bursar 's office or what ? Hey , doc . How 'd your speech thing go ? All right , I suppose . One or two of the students really seemed to grasp ... you don 't really care , do you ? Hola , Senor Samson . See you back at the X-1 in a couple of hours . - Hey , Pop ! - Boys . This place is tits ! Divvy this . - We got these boss Mexican hats ... - Sombreros ! And these super-cool sugar skulls with our names on them . Ah , there you are . Your check , Dr. Venture . Muchas gracias . Super good . Very generous of y ... oh , pesos . Great . These zeroes are all meaningless . Damn it . You people have giant bugs around here . Ah , that is the monarch butterfly . They migrate here to Mexico this time of year . The Aztecs believed they were the spirits of the dead returning home . Wow , but you 're full of helpful information , fella ! And how ! Say , it 's not poisonous , is it ? I ... You 're kidding , right ? No , hijo , he 's not poisonous . That 's where you 're wrong , Mr. College . Honey , what are you going on about ? Don 't call me that in front of the henchmen . Keep it professional . It 's my old nemesis , Dr. Venture . He 's obviously followed us down here . Someone must have leaked our whereabouts to him , but who ? All right . Which one of you sold the Monarch out ? I 'm going to turn around and close my eyes ... and I want the guilty party to step forward . No judgments . You won 't be punished . Just want to know who did it , OK ? Traitor ! Dirty bastard traitor ! I knew it was you , number ... - 37 . - Number 37 ! Strike him from the roster , Dr. Girlfriend . - Speedy ! - Yes , Monarch . You 're being promoted . I want you and a phalanx of no less than three ... and no more than five henchmen to go and observe Dr. Venture . Find out what he 's doing here and whether or not he knows about my ... sinister plan . - Does this mean I 'm getting my wings ? - No . I 'm never gonna get those wings . Someday , Speedy , someday . Here . How about I let you drive the Monarch-mobile ? Horrible disease-carrying things . But that might have been someone 's spirit , Pop . All the more reason to get it the hell off me . Look , don 't you kids have someplace to be or something ? Well , here ! Go ... I don 't know , buy fireworks or something . Just go somewhere that 's not next to your father . I have urgent business to attend to with a colleague of mine , Dr. Guevara ... the top man in his field . I am sorry , Senor Venture . - Doctor . - Si ? No , Dr. Venture . What 's Mexican for doctor ? Doctor . As I was saying , I simply cannot write you these prescriptions . What ? Why not ? The quantities you have specified are practically criminal . You have drugs on this list with completely opposite applications ... you have none of the ailments they treat ... But I have tripolar disorder . - No . - Oh , come on . Look at this place ! I realize I am a Tijuana doctor and all , but even we have scruples . I could lose my license to practice Mexican medicine . OK . I see how it is . And what would you prescribe for Alexander Hamilton ? - Not much . - OK . How about if , say ... President Benjamin Franklin were to ask you ? Hey , I 've been thinking . Maybe instead of being super selfish with the money Dad gave us ... we should try to do something good with it . Aw , crud . Like what , brown-noser ? Well , take a look at old H.E.L.P.eR. There . He 's pretty beat up , don 't you think ? Well , sure . He looks like ... a dried-out turd on a bad stretch of road . Why ? Hasn 't H.E.L.P.eR. Always been there for us ? Hasn 't he always been , well , super helpful ? Sure , he 's great . Well , do you see what I see ? So you want to buy him car paint ? Leave the thinking to me , Albert Ein-steen . Let 's get ' em ! What ? Whoa . No . That 's not the plan . Boss just wants us to observe Dr. Venture . He 's been trying to get that bastard for years ... and what better way than to kidnap his kids ? I 'm sure to get my wings if we pull this off . Bring the Monarch-mobile around . There they are ! Go ! Dad 's gonna be so super surprised when he sees ... Mayday ! Mayday ! Why ? Guys , heads up . We got company . He 's got Speedy . Nail him , boys ! Finally . Jeez . Come on , Speedy . Wow . He 's really on there good . Wow . That sucked . What were you thinking ? Bringing them here ? Who told you to do that ? Well , we thought that ... Actually , it was Speedy 's idea . Great . So it was Speedy 's idea . Super idea , Speedy . Where is he ? He didn 't make it . What do you mean ? Brock Samson got ahold of him , and he ... Samson . Jeez . I don 't need to hear the rest . Poor little guy . He was this close to earning his wings , too . But see ? That 's what I 'm talking about ! Now Venture will send Samson after the rest of us ... and he 'll go totally sickhouse on our asses . I like my ass , gentlemen . Samson won 't be a problem , sir . You ... no way . Is he dead ? Well , this changes everything . Without his walking Swedish murder machine ... the good doctor will have to do just what I say , won 't he ? Take them to the holding cell . Hello . This is Dr. Venture . Attention , Dr. Thaddeus Venture . This is the Monarch speaking . I 'm currently unavailable right now ... but if you 'd like to leave a message , you can do so after the beep . Thanks , and have a scientastic day . Attention , Dr. Thaddeus Venture . This is the Monarch speaking . I have your boys . If you ever want to see them alive again ... Damn it ! No ! Oh , for the love of ... not again ! Wait a minute . One ... two . This is serious . Brock ! Come in , Brock ! Brock , seriously , this is an emergency . Don 't screen me . Oh , H.E.L.P.eR. , thank ... what the hell happened to you ? Yes , yes . Just ... OK . H.E.L.P.eR. Just get me back to the X-1 . Where are we ? You 're supposed to be the super sleuths . You figure it out . We 're in the belly of the lair of the Monarch 's hideout ! Correct , clever boy . And with you two in my clutches ... I finally have your father right where I want him . What 's your problem with our dad , anyway ? Well , I ... he 's my nemesis , my archenemy . I don 't think Pop thinks you 're his archenemy . Come on , I 'm sure the walls of the Venture compound ... are practically caked with the lingering curses of the Monarch 's name . I 've never even heard him mention you . Hey , I always thought Baron Underbheit was Dad 's archenemy . Underbheit ? Why , that dime-store Dr. Doom isn 't fit to ... just you wait till your father calls me back ! That should just about do it . Let 's see if I 'm half the genius I think I am . Good news . Looks like I am . H.E.L.P.eR. , you are now my personal walking , talking electric kidney . Crap . I 'm gonna have to find a more long-term solution . H.E.L.P.eR. , stay close to me . Come . Kidney ! " No cure . " " Transplant from a healthy donor of the same blood type . " Of course ! One of the boys . Where the hell are the boys ? Boys ? Hello ? Hank , are you there ? Dave ? Dean ? Attention , Dr. Thaddeus Venture . This is the Mo ... Listen . You boys don 't have any special way ... of getting in touch with your dad I should know about , do you ? I can 't seem to get ahold of him . We usually use our two-way satellite-linked communicator watches . No . I tried that already . He 's not answering . I 've left , like , a hundred messages . Jeez , you 'd think he cared a little more about his kids . I mean , I 'm sure he 's worried sick about you two . He 's probably on his way right now ... with the whole Mexican National Guard or something . It 's just a little further , H.E.L.P.eR. What the hell Brock is doing all the way out here ... when we need him most is beyond me ... but he is going to get a hot little earful when ... I 'm gonna go check on those boys . - What ? - Nothing . No . I know that sigh . What ? When we entered this relationship ... we both agreed that we were both people who did not want kids . L ... what do you expect me to do with them ? I thought their father would show up in no time . Do you know he 's never even told them he loves them ? You know what I think ? I think you 're trying to compensate for the loss of your own parents . You never talk about that . You want me to talk about it ? Fine . I 'll tell you all about that fateful summer ... the summer of the monarchs . I was a mere eight years old ... practically a caterpillar by butterfly standards . My parents ' private jet crashed in New Jersey 's fabled Pine Barrens ... minutes after takeoff from Newark Airport . Miraculously , I survived . My parents were not so fortunate . When I came to , I was surrounded ... by the most enchanting monarch butterflies . In time , they took me in as one of their own . They became my foster parents . These were the halcyon days . I 'd play with my butterfly brethren . I learned the mysterious secrets of their ancient ways ... supping as their own young do on a steady diet of milkweed ... thus assuring my toxicity to this day . Then , one fateful morning in September ... I remember because it was right around my birthday ... I was ecstatic by autumn 's approach because it meant the leaves of the trees ... would be orange enough for me to build even more convincing monarch wings . I awoke and looked for my monarch family ... but I couldn 't find them . I searched for days , but no sign of them . It was like losing my parents all over again ... only much quieter . So I wandered to the nearest highway , took the first bus to New York ... and claimed a fat inheritance . It was only later that I learned that monarchs migrate south for the winter ... here , to Mexico . Oh , Tenderoni , that 's the only real reason I 've come to Mexico ... to find my foster parents . My big plan , all that work I 've had you doing ... it was just an excuse . Do you hate me now ? Oh , Sweetie . Butterflies only live about nine months . What ? But those boys downstairs are alive , and you 're right . They do need a father . So you go down there and you love those boys and never let go . Oh , Brock . How did this happen ? Where was I when you needed me most ? I know , H.E.L.P.eR. He was like an angel , my beautiful guardian angel ... and this is where it got him . Brock ! You 're alive ! It worked ! My shrine worked ! It 's not all superstitious nonsense . What ? Oh , God , you 're a zombie or something . I never should have played God ! The folly of it ! The hubris ! Boys . Where are the boys ? Double damn it ! Hank , you said the double " D " word . How are we ever gonna get this gate open ? Which one of my special boys is in the mood for piping-hot cookies ? Get him ! Oh , so you want to wrestle , eh ? No , you don 't . Nope . Supposed to be right around here . He was really specific in all those messages he left . Got it . So , what 's the plan ? How long can you live if you 're not hooked up to him ? Oh , I don 't know , a couple hours , maybe , but they 'd be very uncomf ... Come on . H.E.L.P.eR. , you drive . Keep her steady . - Wait a minute . Where are we ... - Get in my car . Quit screwing around . What the hell was that ? Chupacabra . They 're all over Mexico . No way . You had me scared for a minute there . Get his legs ! No fair ! It 's two of you against one . I don 't know if there 's enough Monarch love to go around . Holy crap ! What is going on here ? Minions ! Where are you ? You get the boys . I 'll take care of these guys . Are you sure ? There 's an awful lot of them . They hit me with a truck . What 's all that noise ? No time for questions , baby . Fire up the smaller escape cocoon ... ingeniously housed inside this larger cocoon headquarters ! - Dad ! - Dad ! We knew you wouldn 't let us down . Just in the nick of time , too . Monarch was getting all creepy uncle on us . You 're the best dad in the whole world . Yes , yes . Go , Team Venture ! And so your father needs for one of you to donate a kidney ... so that I can keep on living and doing the " best dad in the world " thing . But ... which one of us , Pop ? Well , I haven 't decided yet . I know . Rock , scissors , paper ! - You 're on ! - Once , twice , three , shoot ! What happened ? I thought I had picked rock . So did I. And I picked two beautiful kidneys . I feel freaking amazing . That 's good soup !

 I think about the day we met . I suppose you arrived par avion . Maybe you were the first to get to security . You didn ´ t intend to stay . You only had 24 hour coverage so only carry-ons . And they probably had a driver waiting so you didn ´ t have to find a car . You ´ d never been to Shanghai before , it was all new to you . How do people live out here ? It ´ s not living , just existing . - You ever liveafuera ? - No . Can I have your cover please ? Candies , sherbet fountains , cigarettes , batteries , hair cuts . - Hair cuts ? Never seen that before ! - l ´ ll show you . - Give me two sherbet fountains . - Two sherbet fountains . Take me in , mister. I can do haircuts . I ´ m wasted out here . You got a spare cover ? I only cover for one . - l ´ m sorry . - You want to swap places with me ? - You ? - l wear the suit , you wear this . It ´ s tempting ! Good luck . - What ´ s your name ? - Nabil . Bye . I don ´ t think it ´ s a good idea to encourage them . If people can ´ t get cover , there ´ s a reason . You arrived in the morning so the streets were deserted . Did you call anyone ? Did you have a cerveza ? I imagine you watching the news , sometimes playing a game , sometimes sleeping , mentally preparing yourself for the night ahead . The thing I can ´ t imagine is that we hadn ´ t met or heard of each other . That you thought it was going to be just another night . Happy birthday , Maria . Time to wake up . It was my birthday , which I hate . Every year on my birthday , I have a dream , always the same dream . I go down into the subway . I wait for the train . I ´ m worried I ´ m going to be late . The train leaves the station . I feel like going to sleep , but I have to find someone ... .. before the train stops . The train goes through one station , nineteen more to go . I have to find him . And then I wake up . Happy birthday , Maria . Time to wake up ! The next year I had exactly the same dream , only this time I went past two stations . Don ´ t ask me how I knew , I just knew there were eighteen stations to go . The next year seventeen , the next year sixteen . Every birthday , one less . Today ´ s my birthday , today I ´ m down to the Iast one . If I faII asleep , I ´ II get to my destination . If I want to , I can discover my fate tonight . - Lo siento . - That ´ s okay . So , what am I going to do ? I ´ m going to stay awake all day . Who wants to discover their fate ? Who ´ II take a chance like that ? - l ´ m here to see Mr. Backland . - l ´ ll send someone along for you . I ´ m here on an investigation and I ´ d find it useful to wander around . - All visitors have to be accompanied . - l know ... - Just let me do my job . - lf l did , I wouldn ´ t be doing mine . That is a conundrum . If I could figure out your password ... - You couldn ´ t do it . - l need one piece of information . - ls this some kind of trick ? - No , tell me one thing about you . Anything at all . My birthday . My palabra is not my birthday . 29 . Your palabra is Carrefour . Crossroad , carrefour . - How did you know that ? - Can I register now ? I listened to you while you weren ´ t speaking . Don ´ t worry about it . - l could get into a lot of trouble . - l ´ ll go straight to his office . Don ´ t worry about it . - William Geld ? Salaam . - Mr. Backland ? You caught me off guard , I wanted to greet you properly . I guess that ´ s one of your skills , cunning . I have no cunning , I ´ m afraid . - This is your first visit ? - Yes . Do you have time to see the mammoth ? We specialize in short-term cover certificates for specific tasks . A parachute jump , maybe a medical procedure . People only buy fakes if we won ´ t grant legitimate cover . If we won ´ t grant legitimate cover , there ´ s a reason . " The sphinx knows best . " Fake cover is a ticket to avoidable suffering . We know which printer the fakes come from . Each printer has its own fingerprint . This one is from a number eight printer . Only a few people can use it , it has to be one of them . I need a quiet room and some time , I ´ ll have this done by this evening . It ´ s a happy workplace , I don ´ t want to create an atmosphere . I don ´ t want anyone to know what ´ s going on . Why ? Tell them the truth , Larry . Tell me something about yourself . Anything at all . I was born in Napally Road , Hyderabad . Tell me something about yourself . Anything ? Try to make it interesting , I ´ ve got a long day ahead of me . I have una cosa for freckles . A sexual cosa . I find freckles a turn on . Freckled skin , it ´ s like it ´ s clothed and not clothed . There ´ s no freckle pornography . Women get famous for breasts and legs . But not for freckles . - There ´ s " Anne of Green Gables . " - l regard that as an erotic classic . The Normans ... amazing ! They invented the whole English language out of nothing but French . - And some Latin , obviously . - Obviously . There ´ s a girl here , Maria . She ´ s tone deaf . She can ´ t hold a tune to save her life . That ´ s beautiful . Don ´ t you think ? - What are you thinking ? - l ´ m thinking , have we met before ? Upstairs , at the foyer , we almost bumped into each other . - l feel I know you . - One thing , one thing about yourself . I don ´ t know if I want you to know something about me . I can never think of anything when people ask me straight out . - You want to prompt me ? - lt won ´ t work if I prompted you . What won ´ t work ? Tell me what you ´ re doing later tonight . - That ´ s a question or an invitation ? - lt ´ s a prompt . Tonight , I ´ m going to stay awake , till the sun goes down . I ´ m not going to sleep . - Why ? - lt ´ s my birthday . Happy birthday . I ´ m going to need to take your information , for future reference . It ´ s difficult when you can get a big denarius for a piece of paper . It ´ s a big temptation . Are you sure it ´ s him ? I thought it might be her . I don ´ t think so . Do you have evidence ? I don ´ t need to give you evidence , it ´ s intuition you ´ re paying me for . Are you okay ? Absolutely . - Am I under surveillance ? - No . Do you want to go out with me ? It ´ s your birthday , don ´ t you have other plans ? Yes , I have to meet someone later but I ´ m hungry . - Let ´ s go and eat . - Alright . I was never scared of you , even when I should have been . Even when my fate was in your hands , I always trusted you . So why do you do it ? For the money . - Why did you do it ? - What ? Lie for me . I don ´ t know . It ´ s very impulsive . I can be impulsive . Happy birthday . I love these , how did you know ? Out of my file ? - A lucky guess . - Fate . Actually , I have a whole bag full of them . For my kid . - You have a kid ? - Yes . - A boy ! - Yes . His name is Jim . - l bet he ´ s very special . - He is special . Everybody ´ s children are special . It makes you wonder where all the ordinary grown-ups come from . These are good ! - Do you want to come to a club ? - Don ´ t you have to meet someone ? - Come , I want you to . - Why ? I want to corrupt you . If you come , there ´ s a definite risk you ´ ll have a good time . If you don ´ t come with me ... then you ´ ll regret it . Come on . Vodka with ice , please . Would you like to sing a song ? Are you sure ? - l ´ m sure . - You don ´ t want to hear me sing . Actually , I was hoping to hear you sing . - Why ? - l heard you have distinctive voice . What else did they say about me behind my back ? Did you know you can take a virus that can make you more musical ? - You sing like an angel . - l did once for Mandarin Chinese . Chinese people knew what I was saying but I didn ´ t . Weird ! I ´ m on a virus right now , an empathy virus . I take an empathy virus to help with my work . I don ´ t like that , that ´ s weird . You could pick up stuff about me . I could . That ´ s like wearing x-ray specs , to look at girls ´ underwear . - l got x-ray specs , they don ´ t work . - But you bought them . - You wanted them to work . - l was six years old . I was interested in skeletons , not underwear . I thought you were a natural intuitivehombre . Does it make any difference ? Of course . - Really ? - The virus ... Damian ! William is helping me celebrate my birthday . It ´ s your birthday ? I didn ´ t know . That ´ s okay , William is okay . He knows about our secret . That ´ s the one that will take me in ! You should kiss William too , because he helped . Tell him what you ´ re going to do . I study bats . The best quality of bats in this world in this cave in Delhi . I ´ ve wanted to see that since I was a kid . You couldn ´ t get cover in the normal way ? I ´ ve tried for eight years . Eight years and only now am I going . Usually , if you can ´ t get cover , there ´ s a good reason . - Yes , " the Sphinx knows best . " - Best . - The Sphinx knows a lot . - lt doesn ´ t know what I know . Some things in life can be worth the risk . Anyone who has ever wanted something knows you have to be prepared to risk . I think I ´ ll be okay . - See you soon . - Bye . - Why did you do that ? - What ? All that , in front of me . You know what I should do now ? I should have his cover withdrawn and you too while I ´ m at it . But you ´ re not going to you , though . Are you ? Why are you being so nice to me ? Are you hoping for a reward ? How did you get those papeles out ? At the beginning of every new batch , we do a test run then destroy them . So I go into work and I have a fake pass under my tongue . I destroy the fake pass and put the real pass under my tongue . Then I go into the bathroom , put it into a pill and swallow it . A couple of days later ... I have the pass . lmpressed ? Come on , be impressed . Thanks for bringing me home . That ´ s very kind of you . Come in . Beautiful ! You have green fingers . Everything is controlled scientifically . Do you think the sunlight is as dangerous as they say ? I hope not . - Would you like a drink , some water ? - Sure . You know that one of my fingers is younger than the others ? - Really ? - Yeah . Which one ? This one . Do you like it ? Very much , it ´ s much better than the other fingers . Maybe I should get me a younger face . I love the sorrows on your changing face . Or whatever it is . I haven ´ t seen this book in a while . The friend one should have is one ´ s best enemy . You should be closest to him when resisting . Look . It ´ s all I ´ ve got left from my childhood . I keep my special memories here . Who are they ? My father and mother before we left Shanghai . These are people like Damien , when I give them papeles . Now you know all my secrets . I love to look at their faces . They ´ re so beautiful . Look at their eyes . They have a look that the rest of us don ´ t have . You look like them a little . You should go to sleep . I don ´ t want to go to sleep , please don ´ t let me go to sleep . I ´ ll make you some coffee . Coffee . I was just going to torture the song and now you ´ re going to murder it ! I ´ m tone deaf , you know ... You find it attractive ? Are you leaving ? I ´ m booked on a flight home . - What time ´ s your flight ? - 11 . What happens at Bikku ? He ´ ll lose his cover . - That ´ s bad ! - l know . You giving out fake papers is bad ... Have you ever lived outside ? I was outside for ten years . I have to go . I have to go . I need to stop at the entry checkpoint . - Why ? - To get more sherbet fountains . Hi , mister . I found this , I thought you could put it to good use . Thanks , God bless you . Go , go . No , I ´ m sorry . Leave him alone . Thanks , God bless you . If we had enough information we could predict the consequences of our actions . would you want to know ? If you kissed that girl , if you talked to that man , take that job , or marry that woman , or steal that papeI ? If we knew what would happen , would we ever take that first step ? Hello ! I ´ m home . - Did you have a good trip ? - Yeah . - Where have you been ? - What are you doing awake ? They will be pleased to see you . Your wife , your special boy . They will want to know all your news . And they will be happy to have you home , safe and sound . - Shall I guess what you ´ re thinking ? - Yes . A bicycle . I can ´ t answer right now so leave a message . It ´ s William , call me . Just to let me know you ´ re okay . - Are you tired ? - Yes . Did you think about me at all ? Did you try to imagine what was happening to me ? Does an empathy virus work long distance ? Maria GonzaIez , aged 25 . employee of the Sphinx . Nurture father : Christian Gunter , born in free port ofJebeI all . Transferred to Shanghai and exiled for financial irregularities . Registered in Kunming , Dhanbad , Betta and Baghdad . He is presumed to be returning to the free port ofJebeI all . Carmen GonzaIez returned to Shanghai , remarried to ... Maria GonzaIez , height : 165 cm ... - De Souza wants you . - What about ? There ´ s been a fatality in Asia , a guy was travelling on one of the papers from Shanghai . - Do you want a coffee ? - No , thanks . - Someone died yesterday . - l know , do you have details ? A man had una cosa about bats , wanted to go to delhi . The place to be if you Iike bats , apparently . He couldn ´ t get cover because he had an ineluctable disposition to Wards disease . - Do you know it ? - No . It makes you bleed to death . Most people in delhi are immune which is why he couldn ´ t get cover . which is why he bought fake papeIes , which is why he bled to death yesterday . - What was his name ? - Damian AIekan . The papeIes are from the same printer as the one you investigated . I ´ m sorry . Get back on a plane , make it right , so you won ´ t be sorry anymore . - There ´ s someone else you can send ? - Why would you want me to do that ? I had some trouble when I was there , some trouble with the virus , I think . We all have problems , william . The way we deal with them is a measure of our worth . Go back tomorrow . Where did you get that from ? I have to get back to Shanghai . - How long will you be away ? - l got 24 hour cover . I ´ ll be back before you know I ´ m gone . There have been three papeles reported . One here , one in San Paolo , one in Delhi . If this doesn ´ t stop , I ´ m going to lose my own cover . I ´ m sorry . This is the first time my intuition ´ s let me down . I think he had an accomplice . A certain Maria Gonzalez . She ´ s gone . What do you mean gone ? Disappeared ? I was told she had a body issue . It was all official . Video Listo Corporation . Hello , I just tried to get into my apartment and it won ´ t work . We have your number listed as temporarily discontinued . - Do I look discontinued to you ? - No , but you may be the holder . - That ´ s not my problem , is it ? - Give me your paIabra . I ´ II provide you with a terminate window to re-code your video Iisto . That ´ d be great , thank you . - Your paIabra ? - Panoplia . Did you know what you were looking for ? Were you hoping I ´ d left you a clue ? Like HanseI and gretel being dragged off into the woods . Panoplia . Maria , today you have no appointments . Maria , today you have a 3 : 15 at the Mai Lin clinic . I ´ m investigating a fraud to which Maria Gonzalez is a key witness . I was officially informed that she has body issues and was unhappy . She has been relocated . There were complications we couldn ´ t deal with . She has been sent afuera . Outside is a big place. lt would help if you were more specific . There ´ s a confidentiality issue there , I ´ m afraid , sir . What was the nature of her body issue ? There ´ s a confidentiality issue there , I ´ m afraid , sir . Why was she summoned for happiness break ? is this a training exercise ? Are you trying to catch me out ? - You got me ! - You didn ´ t get me , though . You were top of the class , very good . Tell me something about yourself . For the report , I have to write this . My mother had this job before me , I inherited it . How long has Miss Gonzalez been pregnant ? I never said that . Was type of Code 46 violation was it ? I never mentioned Code 46 . Where is the Mai Lin clinic ? There ´ s a confidentiality issue there , I ´ m afraid , sir . Thank you for your help . You rented a car . The clinic was afuera , 170km from the city . I imagined you Iike a medieval knight on a quest . The quest for me . I ´ m here to see Maria Gonzalez . No visitors are permitted until 6 . I ´ m from Westerfields . She ´ s a witness in a major fraud case . - Name ? - Maria Gonzalez . - Your name . - William Geld from Westerfields . - l need your print here . - lt ´ s a very urgent situation . I know , name and print ... I can tell by looking at you ... that you are not just a keypad presser , you make judgements . And I made my judgement about you . If you don ´ t have authorisation ... Tell me one thing about yourself , anything at all . I ´ m tired. I have conversations like this one a lot . If I were able to guess your palabra , would you be impressed ? I would be mummified . - lt ´ s Garamond . - lt ´ s nothing like that . Did you have an empathy virus ? It doesn ´ t work here . That ´ s why you got a cold here . We use antiviral bacteria , we ´ re infested with streptococci . Here on the outside we do not have access to some of the pleasures freely available on the inside . I have these ... The gold ones are particularly good . I don ´ t need wealth , I just need a little encouragement . You have a very sophisticated security system here . Of course , we have all kinds of cases here . - What is Maria Gonzalez here for ? - Are you investigating her case ? I ´ m investigating a fraud case , she ´ s a witness . She ´ s had a finger graft . This is Maria Gonzalez . Take a seat . - You okay ? - l ´ m good . If this is about my finger , then I don ´ t want to prosecute . This is not about your finger . I need to speak to Miss Gonzalez alone . You have no authorization . I ´ m investigating an incident at your place of work . Fraudulent papeles were issued from your printer . In the last fourteen days , three people have died , while travelling with papeles issued from your printer . The people who come to us are all doing something dangerous . We have to expect that . Unfortunately some of them won ´ t make it . One of them , Damian Alekan , bled to death . He was fond of bats , remember ? You met him at a bar and you sold him a papel which allowed him to go to Delhi . - When did he die ? - One week ago . I ´ ve been in here for ten days . The papeles were issued prior to you arriving here . I ´ m tired , I would like to rest . Miss Gonzalez is still in recovery . Why is she in here ? - Please , don ´ t use the word finger ... - Her finger has just been ... . lt was damaged and re-grown on her family ´ s insurance 22 years ago . I know a lot about Miss Gonzalez , she was pregnant when she came . I also know that you have no interest in impeding my investigation . She violated code 46 . We aborted the pregnancy and took out the memory cluster around it . - The baby was terminated ? - There was no baby . Just a pregnancy that was terminated and the memory removed . You ´ ve interfered with the memory of a key witness in an insurance fraud . Her memory was very local. lt ´ s just the man , sex act and pregnancy . She doesn ´ t remember the man at all ? The man , the sex , the pregnancy , we ´ ve erased all of them . It ´ s the same Maria Gonzalez . The finger was a placebo memory . I moved it from her childhood . I think it ´ s very effective . - When will she be able to leave ? - She ´ s due to leave tomorrow . I ´ m afraid I may have to ask you to release her to me now . Can you miss someone you don ´ t remember ? Can one moment or experience ever disappear completely ? Or does it always exist somewhere , waiting to be discovered ? Wait , I ´ ve forgotten something . My suitcase , it ´ s very important . It ´ s in the back ! is that what you ´ re going to do ? Put me outside with them ? You ´ ve been outside before , for ten years . You didn ´ t come back inside till you were fourteen . You really did your homework . You can ´ t sing , you like sugar fountains , you like to grow real plants from seeds . I must have been your favourite subject at school . You hate the desert . I always hated the desert . Even at college studying Road Runner cartoons , I had to look away . I always wondered why the coyote didn ´ t buy a Road Runner . He had enough money to buy rocket-powered skates , let alone a Road Runner . How did you do that ? What ? I was thinking something and you heard me . That is weird . Intuition , I can feel what you ´ re thinking . I don ´ t believe in mind-reading , I think it is all a trick . It ´ s not a trick , it ´ s a gift . What am I thinking now ? Damian Alekan . - Have you been here before ? - Once . - You like it ? - l was only here a day . But , yes. I like it very much . Excuse the mess . Come here . Sit down . That ´ s Damian , you recognize him now ? I remember he wanted to go to Delhi . And I remember the look on his face when I gave him the papel . He tried for years to get one officially and couldn ´ t . I was there when you met Damian . I was with you at the bar . I don ´ t understand . You don ´ t remember because they erased your memory . I don ´ t know what you ´ re talking about . I came to Shanghai to investigate a fraud . I knew you were guilty , but then I fell in love with you . Why would they erase my memory of you ? I don ´ t know . Where ´ s my cosa ? - l can ´ t find my cosa . - You haven ´ t lost anything . - You haven ´ t lost anything , relax . - l can ´ t find my ... I can ´ t find my cosa ! Will you stay with me ? - l ´ m so tired . - l ´ ll stay with you till you wake up . - What is it ? - lt ´ ll help you sleep . - l don ´ t understand anything . - Neither do I . My father used to tell me stories as I fell asleep . Stories about JebeI all and the Arabian Sea . Stories of magic and adventure . He used to live there and believed that if we returned everything would be alright , everything would be like it used to , before we were exiled . And in my dreams , I was there . Sample , please . Thanks . I ´ ve screened 30 sets of genes and there are no code 46 issues . It ´ s perfectly safe for you to marry . I ´ d recommend it . You both have the code for high intelligence . - Thanks very much . - Bye , bye . Do you know this woman ? I ´ m looking for her . You must have found her if you have her hair . It was given to me by relatives . - Your relationship to this woman ? - l just want to know about her . You can ´ t liase with her . Look at this . This is her DNA , 50 % match the hair samples . Here ... is the DNA of your mother , a 100 % match , genetically identical . Any liaison with this woman would be a code 46 violation . - How can that be ? - Anything ´ s possible with vitriol . Your mother was one of a batch of 24 cloned foetuses . The hair is from your mother or one of her genetic twins . She ´ s identical to my mother ? Diet , climate , environment , chance , surgery , the stars , God . We aren ´ t prisoners of our genes . is this hair from your mother ? - Are you in love with this woman ? - Why ? is she pregnant ? - Were you naturally conceived ? - ln vitriol . Your nurture parents will have your records . - They ´ re dead . - l ´ m sorry . Thanks . If we ´ re frightened we run , it ´ s our instinct . adrenaline pumps round the body , the muscles contract , our heart beasts faster and we run . We run for our lives , we run for safety , for our home , our families , our loved ones . I don ´ t want you to drive and call . I ´ m going to the airport and I ´ ll be home tomorrow . - Did you catch the bad guy ? - Every time . - How are you ? - l love you . - Me , too . - See you soon . I need a ticket to Seattle . It ´ s completely red , it ´ s out of date . You ´ re not covered for the Asia area . But I don ´ t want to be here , I want to go home . - l ´ m covered to go home , right ? - l really don ´ t know , sir . Yes , I ´ m covered for home . But you ´ re not at home , sir . You ´ re in Shanghai without cover . Why don ´ t you just kick me out in the general direction of home ? You can ´ t fly or be in the Asia area without cover . What am I going to do ? Piss out the window at 20,000 feet ? I don ´ t know your character well enough to say so , sir . Maybe I can guess something about your character . These are particularly fun . I ´ m afraid you guessed wrong , sir . I ´ m a Christian scientist . - l don ´ t do drugs or coffee . - Damn , I ´ m all out of bibles ! - Can I come in ? - Can I stop you ? - l need your help . - How have you been ? I had something to do . I shouldn ´ t be in Shanghai , I should be in Seattle . - You knew that last night . - l have to go . - Go ! - l can ´ t . My papel is red , I can ´ t get out . So you tried already , you were just going to disappear . - l ´ m sorry . - You ´ re sorry ! You say that too much . I need to go home . You have a family ? - Boy or girl ? - Boy . Jim . He must think you ´ re a hero for catching bad guys like me . Something like that . You know what they say , " the Sphinx knows best " . Maybe there ´ s a reason you can ´ t go home . It ´ s fake , I have to swap it for a genuine pass . I ´ ll meet you at the airport at seven , okay ? - Thanks . - Let ´ s go . My name ´ s Maria Gonzalez , I have an access problem . I have a new finger and it needs to be recoded . - Hold on a moment please . - Thanks . - Good morning . - lt ´ s so good to see you . I have a new finger and I need it to be recoded . I know , you ´ ve been relocated . - Sorry ? - You ´ ve been relocated . Why don ´ t you come inside ? - william , where are you ? - l ´ m in Shanghai . - Isn ´ t your cover out ? - l extended it . No , you haven ´ t . Where is Maria ? Why did you remove her from Mai Lin clinic without authorization ? - She was a suspect ? - Was ? is . You seem upset , william . Report to the Shanghai office today , they will take over the case . Bring me what you can , today . exit ONLY It ´ s a single exit cover , valid for today only . The Seattle flights leave from zone C. I do remember you . From a dream , from my birthday . You should go home . Two for Jebel Ali . - Which flight , sir ? - The next one . - Do you have cover ? - l ´ m a resident here . Sorry , I forgot. lt ´ s my new finger . Thanks for choosing Pan Worldwide Airways , have a safe journey . I ´ d always dreamt ofJebeI all , JebeI all of my father ´ s stories . He said you could do anything there , as long as you wanted it enough . You know something ? You know what ? Every time I imagined doing this , I imagined being with you , even though we ´ ve never met . - You okay ? - Yes . We ´ re looking for a place to stay . Come . You ´ ve never been outside , I couId be your guide . Your teacher . Three pacoras . We ´ re looking for a room , we have cover . No one has cover for over here . You can ´ t buy cover for here . Residents sleep at their own risk . - Can we have a room ? - Room , food , a game of chess . There ´ s a shower through there , you ´ re covered in dust ! - lt ´ ll be noisy , I ´ m afraid . - That doesn ´ t matter . We ´ ll sleep through anything , we ´ re so tired . - You ´ ve come a long way ? - Yes . My wife made that before she passed on . - Think about her before sleeping . - Thanks . It ´ s a pleasure to have you . Will you put this on ? - Does your wife look like you ? - No . How did you meet ? We worked together till we had Jim . - You must miss him . - Yes . Sing . What ? I want to hear you sing . I can ´ t sing . Sorry . It ´ s okay . It ´ s not your fault . It ´ s viral . The Sphinx gave you a virus . Like what ? An anti-William virus ? It ´ s involuntary , it ´ s like adrenalin . When you ´ re scared of something , your body gets ready to run away . - l ´ m not scared of you . - l know but your body is . I want you to make love to me . Make me make love to you . I love you ... You knew how the virus works . Was there nothing you could do to stop me ? - l have to make a call . - lt will be recorded . - That ´ s okay . - The phone ´ s there . My name is Maria Gonzalez . I ´ m recording a code 46 violation . What is your location ? - What is this address ? - 168 , Shada Perrera . - please wait there . - l ´ ll be right here . Wake up . Come on , wake up , we have to go . No , I want to stay here forever . See ? I can kiss you now . I have to go , come on . Something ´ s happened . - We need a car , can you help ? - Cars cost more than in the city . I got these . I need money , people have to eat . It ´ s all I ´ ve got . It ´ s not enough . Sonno , take them to the shop and tell Farrukh to give them a mini . Stop playing now , stop it ! You went before a tribunal . They decided the empathy virus had affected your judgement , so they took away your memory of me . Just like they had wiped my memory of you . What does he remember about the crash ? He knows he went to Shanghai , he solved a case on the way to the airport he crashed the hire car . As far as he ´ s concerned , he never went to Jebel Ali . I ´ ll leave you alone . Thank you . I missed you . It ´ s good to see you . I brought you some clothes . Daddy ! Where have you been ? I did a silly thing , I crashed a car , but the doctors fixed me up real good . What am I thinking ? I don ´ t know . I ´ m thinking about boats . I was exiled because I tried to cheat the Sphinx . They left me my memories . They don ´ t care what you think if you ´ re outside . Why bother ? To them , it ´ s as if we don ´ t exist . That feels good ! Subtitles by : Laser S. Film s.r.l. - ROME

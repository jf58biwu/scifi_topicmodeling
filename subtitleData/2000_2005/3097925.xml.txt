 Here we see the seals heading upstream . This is unheard of this time of year . Now , we take you to Yokohama . People are discovering a lot of strange things lately , including oversize fish . Also , reports of kidnappings and rape are on the rise ... That 's some weird stuff . The world sure is crazy . Ya know ... Yes ? I need another drink . Please stop it . Just one more . Save some for the other customers . There aren 't many other customers . You 're right . I 'm always right . Remember that . Human-like lifeforms have been spotted . And the police ? It 's only between us . This is difficult . We 're not " ultra police " . Hear me out . America has had reports of similar sightings . No one knows for sure what they are . You believe it ? Our defense force is ordered to investigate these incidents . We cannot panic the public , so all investigations must be in secret . We 're leaving it to the two of you to solve the case . We have no other choice . Do you accept ? Oikawa-san ... I don 't know . Are you afraid ? You won 't have much backup in the field . This is crazy . I feel like an idiot . Super Power Sentai ! Aleki Thunder ! But , I 'm your mother ! You 're lying ! Damn you . I 'll get you now . Fire ! I won 't allow you to do what you want ! What was all that ? Whatever ... Ota , it hurts . It hurts . Please stop it . Idiot . It 's camouflage . Eh ? It 's weird for two men to be in the same apartment . This is less suspicious . Ah , now I understand . I 'll be more careful . What a dump ! Give me the lunch . Yes . Please don 't do anything weird . Idiot . No worries . No worries . Are our orders here ? Yes , it 's here . The alien lifeform in Yokohama gives off a certain sound wave ... Skip that . Yes ? Do you have a girlfriend now ? Yes , I do . It gives off a wave ... Enough of that . What do we do when we detect the wave ? Call headquarters . Understood . What are you doing ? Calling headquarters . Alien . I have a girlfriend now . Really . We 've been dating for one year . Please wait for love . This evening in Yokohama , a criminal wearing a crab mask ... Is it good , Kazuki ? Starting today , I will be your regular teacher . No way . Your father is your teacher ! Idiot ! Pathetic ! Pathetic ! Get lost ! Cut the crap ! Pathetic ! Get lost ! Kazuki ... Just give me more time . But I ... It will all work out in time . Hey , where are you going ? Out . Wadda ya mean " out " ? You can 't go out . Why not ? Because ... You still have chores to do . I 'm going . I 'm telling you you can 't go out . It 's a school night . I 'm home . You going out ? Yeah . I see . Let me give you some money ... Thanks . I 'm going . What ? You 're home early ... I 'm home . What a pain ... No one listens ... Midori is at that age ... I guess it can 't be helped . Yes ! Black and White Ecstasy ! Zebraman ! Zebra Screeeew Punch ! Zebra Back Kick ! Zebra Bomber ! You 're not gonna ... keep me down ! Not again ! Prof. Ichikawa . Yes ? This is Asano Shinpei-kun . A transfer student . Transfer student ? Don 't scare him . Do your best . Yes . I got it . I 'll leave you three alone . Bye . Nice to meet you . This is our newest teacher , Prof. Ichikawa . Nice to meet you . We 'll be sure to treat you great . He 's normal . What ? Even though he can 't walk , he 's still a regular junior high student . Excuse me . So , Asano-kun , let 's go . Yes . Take care . Okay , from today we have a new class mate . Asano-kun . I 'm Shinpei Asano . Nice to meet you . Nice to meet you . That 's good everyone . His paralysis was very sudden . All the hospitals we went to didn 't understand it . Each day I wonder if he 'll ever be able to stand again . His dad ? I 'm a single parent . Sorry . It 's no problem . I see . Sorry . Professor ... I don 't want him to be treated special . I don 't want any bad things to happen . What do you mean , " bad things " ? Other students may resent him . I understand . I 'll treat him like any other student . Thank you . Hey ... What ? What kind of person are you , Kitahara-kun ? I may not look it , but I 'm a ghost-man . Really ? Yeah . No way . Then prove it . Okay . Here . It 's a white panda ? How 'd you get it ? I told you I 'm a ghost man . It 's really cute . Hey , hey . What does your father do ? Ah ! A school teacher ! It really sucks . He 's not even popular . It 's my dad 's fault that little brother is picked on ... And mom is unhappy ... Really ? Yes . It really is his fault . So , are we done ? No way . One more time . One more time . Yes , yes . Yes , yes . Yes , yes . Yes , yes . I could just go to the corner and buy some juice ... No , no , no ... I might catch cold . Teacher . I finished . Yes . Teacher , do like sports ? To be honest , not really . Hey , what were you working on in class ? Who was it ? Did you draw it ? It 's Zebraman . You know him ? Uh ... yeah . I watched him on TV when I was in Junior High . Now , everyone , let 's all watch Zebraman 's TV preview together . In the year 2010 , a mysterious hero appears . Zebraaaaman ! Fight , Zebraman ! Fly , Zebraman ! Black and White Ecstasy ! Zebraman ! Jyumonji Yuzuru defends the Earth against evil alien invaders ! The series was cancelled after only 13 episodes , but fans still remember it . There 's a lot of news about it on the internet . Turn on the Black and White ! Here 's some printouts . Zebraman isn 't just about a super hero , It 's about believing in your dreams . Whether we had a color TV or not , we would still sing the theme song after it was over . That 's really good . Yeah , it is . It 's great , teacher . That you remember this show . I feel like I 'm talking with my father . Ah . What about the main character ? He was a junior high school teacher . A teacher like me . But , my students don 't really take me seriously . Maybe I should practice my yelling at them ? Teacher , do you know what year this is ? This year ? It 's 2010 . That 's right . It 's the same year that Zebraman took place . Asano . Yes ? From today , can I call you Asano ? Yes . Hey , I wonder ... If we find this lifeform ... Yes . Let 's beat its head in . No way . We have to follow orders . But ... Yes ? I feel like spoiled milk . Air conditioner ? No air conditioner . What ? There 's no space for one ... Prof. Ichikawa ... Yes ? I think it 's good . What is ? You haven 't heard anything . Today , Prof. Ichikawa will go on patrol with Prof. Ippongi . Nice to meet you ! Everyone , count on me . Hello . What are you guys doing here ? It 's late . Go home , go home ! Are you sure that 's okay ? What do you mean ? It is for their own good . Professor , are you hungry ? Have some , have some . The thing I hate the most is perverts . At least yakuza punks live by a code of honor . But perverts , I can never forgive them . Now , I 'll eat . It 's really good . It is good . Ah yes , well you see ... I 'm an expert on this kind of food . But my real passion is to be ... An English teacher at a girl 's school . But I 'm so embarassed ! So what 's the problem ? The problem is the Sailor Suit . Why is that a problem ? It 's difficult to walk . That 's it ? Oh look ! It 's 9 o 'clock . We 'd better get going . It 's still bad . But I want to show Asano . Asano , Asano , Asano ... Nakayama-cho 2-chome 553 Nice neighborhood . What ? That 's not it . Not Asano 's address . Sakura-machi 30 . What ? Andoh . Andoh ? Andoh . Sakura-machi 3-chome 15 . Asano . There 's no doubt . Can 't be seen like this . You 're fired . You 're fired . You 're fired ... I 'm a fan . What are you ? Zebraman . I 'm Zebraman . I 'm Zebraman . Die ! That hurt . Be careful . Be careful . What ? What the hell ? Hey , Hey ! A wave reaction . Let 's go . What ? Hurry up ! Zebra Screw Punch . It 's Zebraman ... Hey , what 's going on ? Ah , nothing . Nothing , huh ? It 's late . You 're alone ? Is your mom nearby ? Seigawa . Seigawa ! Yes ! There was another murder . It seems connected to the others . Of course , we want everyone to be on guard . That 's it . The victim last night seemed to be covered in green goo . I heard it from my friends , even though the police deny it . And there 's nothing about it on TV . Hey ! What are you doing ? Zebraman Punch ! Take this . I 'm good . This way ? Take a look at the body . Ready ? It 's a bit hard to look at . How could that have happened ? Look at the wound ... Oikawa-san ? Hmm ? Nothing . I 'm done . I don 't get it . I 'm done . Burn it . Ready ! Light up ! Fire ! The cases seem to be around the general area of this school . Can I speak freely about the cases ? Yes , of course . You can ask me anything . What 's weird about these cases is that They haven 't been reported on TV or in the newspapers . Hey , what are you implying ? Last night , a lot of people were unaware of the danger . Do you intend to let more people die ? Prof. Kyoto ... Are you afraid of something ? Well , there might be a panic ... Our first concern is for our students . Our concern is to solve the cases . Professor , these two cases are ... I won 't answer you ! You make me sick ! I wonder if it was the real Zebraman ? Asano-san ... I hope that I can meet him again . I see . I see . You can watch Zebraman on here . Really ? It 's the first episode of Zebraman . I remember , I remember . It 's Zebraman ! Ah ! There ! There ! The Screw Punch , right ? I 'm home . Welcome home . Ah , professor ... Ah , excuse me . He was teaching me . Professor Ichikawa is a fan of Zebraman ! It makes me feel very nostalgic . Now I 'll make dinner . Yes . Ah , no , no . I should go . Please . Thanks . What is it ? Professor , you should eat your vegetables . Oh , really ? Well , the truth is ... Need help ? I got it . I see . Your family ? Oh , that 's right . I forgot . I should go . That 's not what I meant . A wife and two kids . I see . What about you ? His father committed suicide . I 'm sorry . I shouldn 't burden you . He was a junior at the university hospital . My son saw the whole thing . He jumped from the building . Yes . I really should go home . Zebra Nurse ! Please . Don 't worry , Zebraman . Zebraman . Dream ? Damn . Sorry . I 'll be back soon . Zebra Bomber ! White and Black Man ! No ! Horse Man ! No ! Zebra Double Kick ! Ah , sorry , sorry . Where were we ... Sorry to keep you all waiting . Teacher ... The time is up . Sorry , sorry . Let 's go . A striped man ? Well , if there is such a man running around like that , then he must be an idiot . Zebraman isn 't an idiot ! What-man ? Asano-kun ... Did you see him ? No , I didn 't . But , Zebraman isn 't an idiot . He 's a savior . Hey ... I 'll be there soon . What did Asano tell you ? That kid ... What are you doing ? That kid ... What he said ... Cut the crap ! I have to solve these cases ! I don 't have time to waste with this crap ! I 'm trying to analyze its programme . Yes . Mr. Kanda . I think it 's impossible to find out any more . But headquarters is waiting for results . Having to examine in secret slows me down . What we need to find out ... Is how this is spread from person to person . It can spread from Yokohama to cover the whole country . Please don 't rush me , Oikawa-san . Enough of this crap ! Whose idea was this anyway ? ! We 're not getting anywhere . It 's beyond human comprehension . What do you mean transfer ? To another school ? We had no choice . The kids are in danger . Danger ? Yes . Shinpei Asano is in danger . I don 't understand what you mean ? If the students are in danger ... You don 't have to know . Don 't worry . As of tomorrow , they 'll be safe . Prof. Kyoto ... The families all agree . What is it you know ? What do you mean ? You know something about the case . I 'm asking you to stop . It 's not just the cases that put the students in danger . What is it ? What do you know ? Excuse me . I 'll go fix it . I 'm not done talking with you . But , my hair ... Who cares about your hair ? I have to go to the toilet . Professor ... Why do you need your bag ? Is there something in there ? Let me see what 's inside ! W-what ? What could be so important ? Hey , wait ! We 're not finished ! Eh , uh , eh , uh ... Great food and great prices . Have some now . What would you like , kids ? Where are your mothers ? What are you doing ? Why 'd you do that ? Don 't eat all that ! Wait ! Wait ! Do you guys have money ? Stop it , you brats ! Stop it you brats ! Hurry , hurry ! Help me ! Shoot them ! I can 't shoot children ! What 's up ? Chief , there 's big trouble . Come on , stop it .

 Well one thing about freezing to death ... Aa least I 'll be well preserved . Oh that 's the spirit . Life is a state of mind . Then I am clearly out of mine . There is no mountain pass off this plateau . Well at least we 're back below the snow line . If you 're looking for warmth you should have gone with Challenger and Summerlee in the balloon . Body heat ? I 'm familiar with the concept . Oh be my guest . Is that your leg ? Oh I 'm sorry . No ... no ... no ... no ... no it 's fine . I 'm starting to feel a little warmer . You ? Yes , I ... a little . You know perhaps if I just shifted a bit . I think you 've got something there . Yes . Maybe if I just ... take my arm . That 's better . Getting hotter in here all the time . Did you hear that ? What ? Huh absolute silence ... how fascinating . Now , where were we ? There it is again . Well the only sound I hear is of cold feet ... running away . Stay here I 'll be right back . Great ! Damn it ! Crude but affective . I thought I told you to stay in the tent ? Does the phrase ungrateful son of a bitch have a familiar ring . Put me down ! Drop her ! Look out ! NO ! Roxton ! No Roxton ! Take her ! Roxton ! Roxton ! NO ! Roxton ! Roxton ! At the dawn of the century ... A band of adventures ... set out to prove the impossible ... The existence of a prehistoric world . The Visionary The Heiress The Hunter The Scientist and The Reporter All chasing the story of a lifetime Stranded in a savage land Befriended by an untamed beauty Together they fight to survive In this amazing world of lost civilizations and terrifying creatures Always searching for a way home A way out of ... the Lost World Oh poor man ... poor Lord John Roxton . You don 't have to die . Who are you ? You may call me Osric ... wouldn 't you like to save your friend . It 's not to late ... look ... Hey ! You there ! Shorty call off the boy scouts . Look how the puny one struggles . Puny ? Untie me I 'll show you puny . You and me alone , now ! Hey where is everybody going ? Oh that wasn 't so bad after all . You have been purified now you are ready . Ready ; ready for what ? An offering to the Gods . You give me too much credit . I have so little to offer , really . You have your beating heart . No ! Your friend will breathe her last ... when the sun is at its peak ... unless of course , you want to save her ? But I 'm dying . Maybe , maybe not . The universe must be balanced . If you live someone must die ... a complete stranger . Someone you don 't even know , but if you die ... so does Marguerite . I must be dreaming . Well look what I have here ... Lord John Roxton 's life force . Oh ! See how fragile ... look how it fades . One moment there is light ... the next only darkness . Oh Who the hell are you ? Do you want it back ? Yes . But the balance ... someone must die . Yes dammit . What the hell ? Now go ... and save your friend . We should be back to the treehouse by noon . Pick up some fresh supplies ... grab a couple of hour 's shuteye and keep looking . What 's the rush all of a sudden ? Roxton and Marguerite are searching North , Summerlee and Challenger South so we have to keep moving west . Hey ? Are you okay ? Never better , I 'm getting so close I can taste it . Any day now I 'm gonna find away off this damn plateau . If you don 't have a heart attack first . I 'm sick of the bugs , I 'm fed up with the ape-men ... and if I see one more damn dinosaur . Besides I miss my family . I miss my job . I miss ... Go on . A lot of things . I miss my world . You want to get off this plateau as badly as I do ... don 't you ? Raptors . Come on . Good shooting . Looks like I owe you . Forget it . I will , right after you hand over your weapons . What did you say ? You blew both barrels . In case you thinking maybe you can make a move for that ... pistol on your hip . By the time you drop the rifle you 'll be dead . You 're out of your mind . We just saved your life ! That 's why I 'm giving you a chance ... but my patience is wearing thin . Ha ha ha Let the games begin . It is time . Oh come on , I 'm sure we can work something out . I mean does it have to be my heart . What about some fingernail clippings instead ... a lock of hair ? It 's my real color ! NOOOOOO ! John ! Better late then never . Drop the knife . That was easy . Approach and die ! Look out ! You want to play swords huh ? Roxton ! I 'm doing the best I can . Now why don 't you be a good girl . Ouch the lady has an iron jaw . Trust me she 's no lady . I thought you were ... Up you come . I saw her kill you . Come on before her friends get back . Do you think we lost them ? I don 't know . We didn 't have enough time to cover our tracks . I 'll take a look around . Got yourselves a little castle in the sky . Quick disable the elevator ! Well ? No luck . I brought the family along this time . I 'll give you one chance , surrender and live . How much gunpowder do we have left ? Not enough to blow them up . Tic tock , tic tock . Nobody steals my home . Go to hell . I gotta tell you for a dead guy you got great stamina . I guess we can slow down now . It 's been at least a couple of miles . Yeah an hour ago . Up here . What the ... ? Congratulations she lives ... well done Lord John Roxton ... Friend of yours ? I kept my part of the bargain now it 's your turn . My turn ? Bargain , what bargain ? Someone will die , a man . Someone you don 't know . I remember . Something strike you funny ? You have to kill him . You never said anything about that . Surprise ! That 's what so funny . You 're the only one who can pull the crystal sword from the rock . Ah excuse me . Would somebody mind telling what the hell , sorry heck ... is going on here ? Nothing is going on here . I never promised to murder anybody , come on . Ow ! You 're such a gentleman . Do you want to tell me about it now ? He 's a very old man , probably be dead soon anyway . How did he do that ? Now , lets get one thing straight little man . I. Don 't . Murder . Anyone . Not even your own brother ? You 're already damned Lord John Roxton ... what 's one more death . Go to hell . Roxton After you . Talk to Lord John Roxton please . Why should I ? I thought you knew . He bargained his soul for your life . Marguerite ! I like you Marguerite . I 'll make you a deal . I 'm listening . All Lord John Roxton has to do is retrieve the crystal sword . Did you say crystal sword ? It lies imbedded in a rock near here . Then what ? I 'll take care of the rest . Well suppose he refuses ? Then I will take back what I have so generously given ... his life . Marguerite now ! Listen I 've gotta run . If we need anything we 'll be in touch . One hour Marguerite ... you fail and he dies . Awake . My reward ? Postponed , I 'm afraid . I 've failed you . No , no , not you . Only Roxton can pull the crystal sword ? But he will not do so willingly . Then we must bend his will . So let me get this straight ? You were dying then that mini-person comes along , waves a magic wand ... and brings you back to life . Do you hear how that sounds ? Do you think it 's a trick , an illusion ? You saw the blade into my chest , the blood . What the hell do you want from me ? What Osric said about your soul ... are you sorry you saved my life ? No , of course not . All right whatever you say . That 's a clever diversion , kill ourselves before they can attack . Not clever enough . Oh we 're sitting ducks out here in the open . This way , take cover in here . What the hell are they playing at ? Ok I 've had enough for one day . I 'm ready to be bored again . Did you notice something odd about what just happened ? What other than the fact that we 're still alive ? It 's was almost as if they 're herding us like cattle . Into the forest ? That doesn 't make any sense . Why not just kill us out in the open when they had the chance ? Exactly , why here ? What 's so special about this place ? Would you at least listen to what I 'm saying ? I refuse to surrender . We wait until darkness we put a rope ... down over the side and we slide down . They 'd kill us . We send the elevator down , while they 're waiting for it we escape . They 'd still have the treehouse . - And we 'd still have our lives . - No . What do you mean no ? This place is my life . All I ever knew of the world , my parents , its here . Veronica . A piece of my mother 's sewing that she never finished ... my father 's favorite records ... a book that my parents use to read me when I was a child ... the lock of baby hair still inside it . I didn 't mean ... This treehouse is my life , my world . Don 't expect me to give up on it without a fight , I 'd rather die first . I think I can help you there . No ! She wants to play . First one who dies loses . My kind of game . You lose . The coast looks clear . Just take it easy . What ? Just wondering if there were any white lights ... choirs of angels . Let it go . Oh come on , death must have felt like something ? Like a blade of ice splitting me in two . I 've never been more afraid in my life . I 'm sorry . Forget it . Thank you for coming back for me . You think I did what I did to save your life ? You don 't get it do you ? I was a coward , Marguerite . No , no . You know it wasn 't death I was afraid of ... it was not living . I couldn 't believe it was over ... my life . My Life ! What ? That was it ? It can 't be ... and then ... it wasn 't . You 're not a coward John , just human . Welcome to the planet . Lord John Roxton ... at last we meet . You know me ? Yes and I know why you 're here . And why is that ? You have come to kill me . Did that hurt ? Why would it hurt ? All you did was pull a steel rod with jagged spurs out of my flesh . It 's not bleeding much just take it easy . I 'll be fine . Veronica I 've been thinking . So have I. You were right . No , you were right . I was just being selfish . Look at you . I almost got you killed protecting the treehouse . But it is your home , your world . It 's just a bunch of planks and a bit of thatch . It 's not flesh and blood ... and it 's not worth losing you . We 've got enough bullets to last for awhile . We 're out numbered and who knows what they 're gonna try next . All the more reason to get started now . What do you think you 're doing ? We may not make it ... but I 'll be damned if we 're going down without a fight . Don 't worry I don 't take it personally ... your killing me I mean . That 's big of you . Osric can 't make me kill you . Don 't take the boy for granted . Osric 's powers are strong . How do you know ? He comes from the same plane as I. A plane you came from a plane ? Plane , dimension ... whatever you 'd like to call an alternative existence . Oh yes of course ... so you 're saying you and Osric are magical creatures ? You mean like Gods ? Don 't encourage him . Can a God be tired ? Sit . Look whatever , whoever you are . Why does Osric want you dead ? I 'm his jailer . We don 't see any bars . I keep him imprisoned here , on this mortal plane . Keep his evil safe from the world . He 's evil ? What 's he done ? My dear if I told you it would drive you insane . If you 're not one of us how can you die ? Nothing can kill me ... except of course the crystal sword . What 's that got to do with me ? Only a damned man pure of soul can free the crystal sword . Damned ? All right I 've heard enough why don 't we just change the subject . I 'm damned ? Only in your heart . But that 's the one place it counts . After your brother 's death you cursed a little corner of yourself . And yet , as a being , you remain pure of soul ... so you 're the perfect man for the job . Well you can relax old man , you 're safe . I have no intentions of pulling that sword . Well don 't you see that 's the beauty of it all . The road to hell is paved with good intentions . Who says we don 't have a sense of irony . My men have failed me I will gut them myself . Be still everything is going according to plan . The man and the woman are lost to us . Lord John Roxton will never be lost to me . I saved a little piece of him . I know that place ... an hour from here at most . You see Lord John Roxton will always be mine . I think this is the one . Oh on second thought maybe not . Ground dried beef and burlap . Are you sure you know what you 're doing ? I 've watched Challenger and Summerlee enough ... to grab the basics , I think . Oh , that 's the one . It smells like rotting meat . Sulfur dioxide . That 's the idea . A little gunpowder ... Oh my god . Help me ! Last chance . Line them up . Either hand over the treehouse to me now or you 'll burn alive . Now ! Whatever you 're going to do , do it now . If one of these things hit the thatched roof ... we go up like a fire ball . But to just leave him like that , an old man . He 's not an old man . Well whatever he is . Safest place for him is far away from that crystal sword , and that means away from me . You know I keep hearing about that sword but I don 't see it anywhere . Fine with me let 's just get home . How many bullets you 've got left ? What ! I was supposed to be counting ? Never mind just shoot . Come on now , can 't we all be friends ? I guess not . Look woman to woman what did I ever do to you ? You denied the offering . Let 's just say my heart wasn 't in it . So you want to play dirty . The sword has awakened . Roxton ? Oh thank god . Here , come on rise and shine . Easy , easy it 's only me they 've gone . Oh no , the sword . What about it ? The crystal sword it was in that rock . Was ? I drew it . Well then the old man 's as good as dead . Not if I can help it . Wake up . Huh ? I 've got some good news . Roxton ? Out here . What is it ? Quickly ! The good news is you 're going to die . The crystal sword . Free . After all these millennia . Free . The man called Roxton won 't use it against me . Left one ? Right one ? Where 's the sword ? Give up ? It 's in you . My king . Now you have the sword . I have been a faithful servant and fulfilled my part of the bargain . Yes you have ... my beautiful warrior . And my reward ? Unfortunately it lies in the next life . Oh we 're too late . I 'm sorry , my friend . The sword , it was an accident . You forget who I am , there are no accidents . Take it easy . Osric is on his way back to the altar now ... to cross over . Marguerite ! Find some cloth hand some water . I 'll be back . Don 't bother you can 't save me . A damned man can only ... hope to safe himself . No . Oh no ... no ... no ... no please not yet , tell me , tell me how ? Osric ... the ... altar How ? How ? Come on Roxton . Its time for plan B ... I heard what he said " Osric the altar " . Now if he escapes we stand to lose a lot more than him . Not too tight ; I want to make sure these babies really pop . Perfect , you ready ? As I 'll ever be . What a waist . If I can 't have it no one can , this time : aim for the roof . You 'll have to do better than that . Here 's two more start spreading them around . Right . What the ... ? Get the hell out here you 're not gonna believe this . They 're throwing meat at us . Oh , that smell . Like something rotting . It 's working . Keep it up we have a few more . You better get used to the smell of dead meat . Because that 's what you are . That 's the last one . When I get my hands on them . I think I 'm gonna be sick . Shut up listen . The meat , that stench , it 's attracting every damn raptor in the area . Let 's get the hell out of here now . Not today my friend . Stop right there . Well look who 's here ... Lord John Roxton . Who are you ? Where 's Osric ? You 're already damned what 's one more death ? You ! Come to watch the final chapter have you ? Fitting I suppose . Without you I wouldn 't have this . Now you will see what few mortals have ... you will see me cross over . Nobody is going anywhere . Fools ! I 'm immortal now nothing can kill me . Maybe not but I bet I can piss you off . What have you done ? We 've grown so fond of you , you simply must stay . By the time I 'm through with you Lord John Roxton ... you will beg for death . Well Lord John Roxton , are you ready for death , yet ? Not ... even ... close . John ! I gave you life . Sorry I won 't ... be returning the favor . Are you ok ? Me ? Yeah , yeah , yeah sure , I 'm fine . Look ! He 's gone , he 's finally gone . No , don 't look back . Oh don 't be silly it 's a pleasure . After what you two have been through . Cooking dinner is the least we could do . Absolutely right , it 's the least they could do . Challenger I 'll need a fork and Summerlee ... another glass of wine when you have a moment . Where 's Roxton his foods getting cold . I 'll find him . No that 's okay , I know where he is . A toast . To what ? To our life here , now . And to wherever tomorrow takes us . Penny for your thoughts . Overpriced at that . If anyone 's damned around here , it 's not you . Don 't say that . At least you have a pure soul . Last time I checked mine was a little worse for wear . Well that 's why I 'll always be around to set you straight . Dirty job but someone 's gotta do it . Humph . Dinner is served . You said always . Did I ? Come on you two , nothing worse than cold raptor . Truer words were never spoken Professor .

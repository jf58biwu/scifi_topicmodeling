 Previously on Farscape K. D 'Argo , your son is being sold in a lot of 10000 slaves . - Are we gonna rob a bank ? - Yes ! In one container is enough wealth to buy the entire shipment of slaves . Crichton ! Seal all exits ! - Zhaan ! - The doors are sealed ! Aeyrin , what 's happening ? - Scorpius must be onto us . - They won 't get out . What the frell did you put in my head ? A tiny ship a tiny seed that 'll be growing in your brain . Scorpy , when he got me in his chair he did something and it 's getting worse . We have done it , we have done it , we are rich ! as soon as we established an exchange rate for this ingots we 'll know exactly how rich , we really are ! They 're eating the ship . Metalistes , they consume metal . They are over two thousands of this creatures onboard . We can never kill them one by one , like this . I can 't lose Jossie , not again . - What do you want ? - From you nothing ... But your father , will give me something I would very much . Surrender to me , or the boy dies . Item one , we need a blood tracker . Come with me . Item two , we have to make our way to the pository , For that ... we need a sheyang . Three , we need a tavloid . You want the gantelet , you take me with it . And finaly , we need a zhennetan pirate . I like your proposal . This guys are mercenaries . We get them , we go in hunt , we kill Scorpius , and we bring your son back . - You burned Moya ? ! - To save her . - No ! - Scorpius is going to kill Jossie . - No , he won 't . Jossie , it 's really you ! You win ! As if is there over any doubt ? And now on Farscape . All right , Fronkensteen , let 's get it on , get your property out of my head . It 's controlling you , isn 't it , John ? I don 't know what you 're talkin ' about . In there ... my neural clone . It forced you to me . Nothing forced me here . Annual checkups are essential to good health . You 're lying , John . I always know . Don 't worry . Soon I 'll take the pain away . This thing in my head . This chip . Part of me .. now . wants it to control me . So , I 'm gonna go to Scorpy and have him take it out before it 's too late . Before I no longer want it gone . Goodbye my friends . Least by swapping myself for Jothee I can do some good . You see how you misread him ? This doesn 't change anything . What 's not changed ? The plan . Why we brought you all here . Hey ! Nobody brought me I volunteered . I ... am the Holy Warrior of Turu . Whatever . All I 'm saying to the rest of you is , that you were willing to go and save Jothee and instead we 'll just go and rescue Crichton . Excuse me . You 're forgetting one thing . What ? We came on this 'adventure ' for one reason . You said you could pay us . That 's right . Well that 's true , but ... Have you any currency now ? we did have currency .. ah , but what we thought was currency actually turned into , um , a- - a creature .. and it ah , it- - it was alive and we- - we had to burn the ship .. I understand that girl . But you see my problem don 't you ? I don 't do anything unless I get paid . And since you no longer have currency .. Moya , is now mine . Go on , shoot her . You 're an embarrassment , Zelkin . You 're worse- - You 're worse than an embarrassment . You 're an idiot . What are you doing ? There are thirty thousand containers in the shadow depository filled with riches that you could have , but you 'd rather point a gun at a girl . What are you trying to do , Aeryn ? Shame me into going with you ? No , because even if you wanted to , I wouldn 't go into battle with you now- - Do you know why ? Because you are a coward , and an idiot . What do you think you are going to get . if you steal Moya ? She 's a half burned Leviathan . I mean , you two have to be the two stupidest pirates I 've ever met . We 're not stupid ! Hey ! What 's going on ? Stay where you are and remain calm ! Everybody . Keep calm . See , Zelkin ? You don 't have the numbers . Get that gun outta my face ! I think this whole idea rots ! I want- - I want ! I want ! My side , your side ! All of you- - I want ! What 's the matter with you , frek face ? Matter , matter , I 'll tell you " matter " . Anti - matter - matter - matter - matter - matter ! Scorpius killed ten thousand of my people ! Ten thousand cast into space . Ten thousand souls screaming in my brain ! The chair , the chair , remember the chair ! What chair ? This frek is crazy ! Are you coming ? Do you agree- - agree ? Will you fight like this down there ? Of course , of course , no hands , no hands ! Then I change my mind , Zelkin . This one has the spirit of the hunter , and not the prey . But I want currency if I come , and plenty of it . You 'll get it . You 'll all get it . So , are we agreed ? Are we going down to rescue Crichton ? Not now , Pilot . We 're negotiating . But , there 's a ship approaching . is it Scorpius ? No . It 's ... it 's ... Talyn . Scorpius , tell me something . Why are you so interested in this human ? There 's nothing impressive about the species . Try not to move so much . One flinch at the wrong time , and this will ... paralyze you . It 's kinda hard not to flinch here , Scorpy , with Frau Blucher tickling ' my prostate . What are you doing to him ? Why don 't you just take him and leave ? I must soften his neural receptors to see if my clone in his brain has reached the information I need . If I have .. then I will call my Command Carrier back from battle and be away from you . See , Flavius Scorpius here wants to visit foreign lands , meet foreign people , and conquer them . You overestimate me , John . I have no desire to dominate the universe , but know this- - the wormhole technology in your brain .. will sway the balance of power as we know it . Imagine ... the ability to move an army in an instant .. the power .. to make hostile planets disappear . Crais , we are very thankful that you allowed Talyn to respond to her mother 's distress call . Eight entire tiers are burnt , and Moya 's immune levels are falling to critical . The nutrients that Talyn 's supplying should start to heal Moya . Keep a check on the electrocell levels- - they mustn 't rise above six parts . I am well aware of that . How much longer will Talyn remain linked to Moya ? Two arns . And then you 'll be leaving . Well , there 's little more that Talyn can do . Is there some reason you wish us to stay ? We are planning to attack a shadow depository on the planet below us . And you want ... Talyn to help ? Scorpius is in the depository . Tempting . I thought that you didn 't want to use Talyn for violence . You all said that from the beginning . Yes , but this is different . How ? Is this violence more acceptable because it 's for you ? No , it 's because Scorpius has captured Crichton , and he 's going to kill him if we don 't get down there . There 's always a reason for violence , Aeryn . Thousands of people die for the most virtuous causes . You don 't have to lecture me , Crais . I believe I do . You have lectured me countless times . How long has Scorpius held Crichton ? Four arns . Then , I recommend you bring down a basket , without any holes .. so that Crichton 's liquid remains are not lost . He 's already dead , Aeryn . and all the doors are cross - synchronized so , when you 're .. here , I 'm .. here . And - and everything 's perfectly timed because we 're on a silent count . Right ? You pay attention ! If one piece of this plan fails , then the entire plan fails ! You got it ? Look , all I understand is that I 'm going down first ! With Bekhesh . Great ! We 're going down ... while you all stay up here , out of danger . You 're the tracker . You must locate Crichton before we risk ourselves . What are you doing with that head ? He 's an old enemy . I like that he doesn 't talk back . As soon as you locate Crichton , then the rest of us will follow straight down . And then Teurac and I will destroy the generator . How come I don 't get that job ? Because you can 't produce a fireball that burns at seven thousands klances . How will I know when to start burning the generator ? I told you ! We 'll all be on a silent count for the entire battle ! a silent count ? While we 're fighting ? Yes ! It 's easy ! It 's complicated . What do they do ? The Zenetans will deploy The Flax . The Flix , what the frell is The Flix ? The Flax is a net that will trap any ship coming after you ! A net . Oh , I see . They stay up here opening a net ... while I 'm down there risking my life ! What 's the point of a plan , if you don 't get away at the end ? Pack animal ! Do you know what that is ? No . What is it ? It 's ah , it 's your blood ancestor 's Qualta Blade . My father 's father used it in the Siege of Repmek . You 're kidding ? He fought with this ? It weighs a drackik . It 's perfectly balanced . I still use it myself . I 'm ... I 'm sorry that we haven 't spoken . Don 't be sorry . I don 't know what to say either . Who did this to you ? Who mutilated you ? You did . In a way . You 've done everything that ever happened to me . Jothee .. son I had to send you away . After your Uncle accused me of killing your mother , I- - I 'm not angry with you . what 's going on on this ship . You don 't expect me to help you save Crichton , do you ? I thought you would want to , I- - Listen ! I 'm interested in saving myself . For ten cycles I 've been running , trying to survive . I realize that . I want to know everything that has happened to you in you 're life You don 't want to know ! Believe me . You don 't want to know . I have done things . Many things I am not proud of , to survive . Now , I - I - I don 't want to shame you , but I am not going back to that planet . I only just got my freedom back . I 'm not going to risk losing it again . There . He 's ready now . Oh , don 't stop now , Scorpy ... Roll me over and baste the other side . Are you going to take out the implant ? No . I 'm going in . What the hell ? This is Sawyer 's Mill . My Dad used to bring me fishing here when I was a kid . This is a place inside your memory , John . A place in your brain . In my brain ... Yes , we 're inside your brain . And no ... I 'm not Scorpius . But he is . Have you obtained the wormhole information ? I believe I 've burrowed far enough . The information was well hidden by The Ancients . I suspect even Crichton is unaware of the specifics . Is he ready to have the chip removed ? I 'll call my Command Carrier . When we reach my ship , and I remove my neural clone ... your death will be painless . Screw this . I can 't move . God , I can 't move . I 'm sorry , Aeryn , you 're wasting your time if you came here to beg . I 'm not begging . Choose your own word . Look , Crais , we 're all going to die if you don 't help us . Will ... other lives be lost in this attack ? You can have anything you want . Anything . Aeryn Sun ... are you ... offering yourself ? Crichton ... if he 's alive , must mean a great deal to you . You can take what you want and I won 't stop you . I don 't want you to think I 'm a coward . I don 't . I 've been .. thinking about what you said earlier . I was wrong to ask you to join us in battle . It 's not your fight . No , Father . If it 's your fight , then it 's mine too . Thank you . We need to talk ... about the plan . Not again Pilot , would you mind telling these .. fools , what we talked about earlier ? D 'Argo advised me to auto - program the Maintenance Bay . If you try to mutiny , the chamber will fill with Benim Gas , and render you unconscious . We have no desire to die , Ka D 'Argo . But , you are a warrior . You must admit , this plan seems .. flawed It 's more than flawed . It 's frelled . And that is why I say we should forget about it . Forget about it ! You think they 're just going to let us walk in down there ? Pilot , is Moya well enough to do us one more favor ? What kind of favor ? A low level maneuver through atmosphere . I ... think she might be able to manage it once . I 'll ask her . This is what I think we should do . Moya should prove a distraction . And we go down there , burst through the front doors and storm the place . It 's what we do best . Are you ready to go down now and save Crichton ? But we all heard his transmission . What if Crichton 's worse , and won 't be rescued ? Well , that 's easy . I put a bullet in Crichton 's head and end it . The Command Carrier is arriving six arns earlier than expected , sir . Well , that 's too bad . I thought you wanted to leave as soon as possible . I do , but ah ... good news . I 'm always suspicious of good news . Hey , Scorpy . Why don 't you cut me down , isn 't torture time over ? I don 't torture people , John . You misunderstand me . Now that my neural clone has reached the information I need , I 'll remove it .. as soon as my Command Carrier arrives . It 's seems .. Oh , whatsamatter ? Got a little warm head ? How 'bout I change that rod for ya ? I got some spares . Natira , lock this chamber down ! Open it for no one but me ! I 'll do it . Human , you are surprising . I 've never seen Scorpius worry about anyone as much as you . Don 't be jealous Frau Blucher .. he only loves me for my mind . You know , you should come in a visit sometime . Why would I ever want to go inside you ? So the Scorpius in my head can tell you exactly how he 's going to kill you . Well , I can tell you . You 're about to taste blood . Was that good for you ? Moya ? Anyone ? How does this frelling thing work ? I hear you , Blood Tracker . Well , we 're just outside the depository , and yes , you were right . The guards aren 't looking for a Vocarian or a Tavlek . Can you smell Crichton ? No , but ... Why not ? Oh well , it 's just ... The problem is , he 's a lousy tracker ... it seems smelling ... is a female 's job ! Oh , frell ! I don 't want to hear excuses . Just find Crichton ! You 're no help Bekhesh ! Why don 't you frell off ! I would have found him by now if it wasn 't for you .. clumping around behind me ! Fine ! From now on , you 're on your own ! What 's the matter , Teurac ? Uh , nothing ! Can you produce flame ? Of course ! I will not let you endanger the rest of us . Stark 's plan depends on your ability to produce flame . If you cannot .. I must warn the others . No ! I still have flame nutrients , but can no longer tap into them . Unless ... Unless what ? If you have Taakar serum ? But that 's poison . Pilot ! Answer this frelling thing , will you ? Ah ... I 'm sorry , Rorf . I 've been training all my senses on healing Moya . I got through the waste vents . Crichton 's on the level above the main chamber . He 's ... I told you . I don 't know this human . Bounty Hunter . Why are you here ? Well I was planning to make ... a deposit . A deposit of what ? Fur lice ? Akkor , back away and shut up . I 'm just doing- - Back away , now . Bounty Hunter . This is the last time I will ask Get frelled ! You know what I was doing . I was casing the joint for Zenetan Pirates . I didn 't know you were here , and I don 't know who he is . Zenetan Pirates . Please . Allow me to question the animal . Sometimes a female 's touch ... You should have answered me . I was trying to save you . Animal , you have lovely eyes . I love red eyes . Very sensual . Very unusual . Animal , what are you doing here ? I told you- - Do not lie again ! Who are you communicating to , and what is the plan to free the human ? Plan ? I don 't know of any plan . Animal , I love your eyes ... your lying eyes . and that 's all I know ! They plan to destroy the generator , then attack in the darkness . Darkness is the key . Don 't take my other eye . senses tell me that this animal is telling the truth . Braca come with me . If we secure the generator , their plan will fail . We have to be fast . Once we land on the planet , Moya 's going to run a distraction . Teurac , Zhaan , and Stark , I want you to go through the waste vents , into the depository , and destroy the generators . Aeryn and I will meet up with Bekhesh . Once the power is gone , we 'll be able to storm through the center chamber doors , and rescue Crichton . What about me ? I thought I was going too ? You 're going to stay on the transport pod with Rygel . I said I 'd go , that 's why I 'm here ! Look , it is not your fight ! I 've lost you once before . I 'm not going to lose you again . Braca ... while I secure the generator , get to the monitor and be my eyes and ears . Tell me . Is there a back way to the generator ? Pilot . We 'll be touching down on the planet in thirty microts . Good luck , Aeryn . Good luck to you all . Thank you , Pilot . Rygel , I 'm handing control over to you ... now ! Let 's do it . Starting descent now . Chiana , tell the Zenetans to prepare for a low - level maneuver . You got it Pilot . Blue Eyes ... look out at that . That is the last sight your eyes will ever see . You are a sick puppy . Scorpius has to kill me and you 're still gettin ' your jollies . Oh , he doesn 't ... he doesn 't have to kill you , Blue Eyes . What ? He ... he can get the chip out without hurting me ? Oh yes . First red , and now blue . Scorpius wants your brain . He said nothing about your eyes . Blue eyes . so soft .. very rare . What the frell is that ? That 's Moya . You 're clear to land , Rygel . Get in there now ! Sir ? We have a problem . Bekhesh , take out the camera ! Mobilize every available soldier . Have them standby outside the main chamber . Oh , dear , dear , dear , what has Moya done here ? You are so screwed , Medusa ! I tell you what- - You get me out of here , I 'll help you stay alive . Why do you want to escape now , human ? You just told me that I could get the chip out of my head without dying ! When you get me out of here , I 'll give you the damn chip ! Hell , you can have the wormhole technology ! As a bonus , you can have one of my eyes ! Let us go , you bitch ! The generator 's this way ! Quick ! Teurac , that 's the generator . Burn it ! Give me the Taakar serum . Give it to me now ! Are you sure ? It 's seven units . It 's a lethal dose . Not for us . Younger Sheyangs have survived nine ! Give it to me ! There is no other way . We have to get that frelling gun ! Good shot . I was aiming for between his eyes . Teurac , what 's taking so long ? You have to destroy the generator , now ! I 'm trying . My chest ... the fuel is there , but ... I can 't reach it ! You must hurry , they 'll be here soon ! I 'm here already , Zhaan . Put the weapon down . Put the weapon down , now ! Why hasn 't the power gone off ? It 's that frelling Sheyang . He couldn 't do it . I knew I shouldn 't have trusted him ! Do you think there 's anyone on the other side of this door ? Are we going to do this or not ? I don 't know that we have any other choice . None whatsoever . Natira . Natira , why aren 't you answering me ? Scorpius . Don 't worry about her . Worry about me ! Shoot him ! No , don 't ! He 's a Sheyang . That 's right . I 'll explode if you shoot me . Goodbye , Zhaan . This is not your fault . I always knew it had to end like this . They did it . They killed the power . You two go to night vision . Mine 's not working . Just shoot ! Wait . I think I did it . My night vision 's finally working ! For someone who couldn 't see ... You did okay . Braca ! Braca ... can you see Crichton ? No , the monitor 's have gone dead . Then get me some emergency power now ! Natira , I know you 're listening . If you 're betraying me , if anything happens to Crichton .. Come on , Natira ! You 've got to make up your mind quick ! Answer me ! Scorpy 's gonna kill you , no matter what happens here ! You don 't believe me ? Go in my head and ask the clone how you 're gonna die ... ask him ! Natira ... ask him . Where is he ? I 'm here Natira . Tell me . Scorpius would never harm me , would he ? Now I know why Scorpius found you so .. enticing . To possess a beauty like you .. to feel .. all of this . Crichton 's right . Scorpius is going to kill me . Oh , my lovely . How fortunate you are . You 're death will be painless . Natira ! Come get his fork outta my neck , forget about him ! If I take it out , will you get me on Moya and away from Scorpius ? Do we have a deal ? Where is Crichton ? You said he was here ! This is where Rorf said he would be . They must have moved him ! Obviously ! There 's a way out in the lower level , we must move faster ! What 's the matter , Crichton ? I 've got Scorpius in my head , and he 's not going to let me go ! Move ! Don 't push him , bitch ! Just , stop it ! Don 't tell me to stop it ! She took out my eye ! Peacekeepers ! We 're on our way to the pick up point , Rygel . Come and get us now ! On our way , Zhaan . Outta my way , slug . I 'm gonna drive- - Intruders in the landing bay . Get a squadron up there now . Braca , Braca , signal the Zenetan Pirates . Zelkin , deploy The Flax . I repeat . Deploy The Flax . Zelkin ? Who are you speaking to ? Is that a comm ? Easy , easy , girl . Oh , I didn 't know you cared . Kurz , release The Flax . Why the frell aren 't we moving ? It 's The Flax ! We 're trapped . You 'll never get away from me , John go ! You go away , you 're not real ! Go away , Scorpius ! Move it ! Scorpius ! Don 't shoot Crichton . I need him alive . Crichton ! Get back ! " There 's no escape , John ... no escape , John " Lets ' go ! We have a deal , Crichton ! Leave him , John . Come on ! Leave him ... and come to me . " There 's no escape , John . There 's no escape . No escape . " Take me to Moya ! " There 's no escape , John , there 's no escape . " Frell you , Crichton . Die alone ! My female ! My female ! D 'Argo , you must go back to her . You must tell her ... I will ! I will ! They 're shooting from both sides . We 're trapped . Rygel . Rygel ! Why aren 't you here ? Rygel ? Is that you , Zhaan ? Crais ? Has Talyn returned ? I 'm sorry about this . But , Scorpius will kill me if I don 't hold Moya for him . We 're free , Chiana ! The Flax ... is gone . Kurz ? Kurz ? What 's happening ? Kurz is dead . Talyn has destroyed your ship . I 'll take Moya then . You 're not taking anything ! Oh , what a waste . Talyn has just destroyed the Zenetan ship . Have you come back to help us ? Let 's just say that I 'm here . All right . Hang on a microt . Zhaan , Stark . Yes , Aeryn , we 're here . Can you remember from the blueprints what runs parallel to the internal corridors ? I think they are reverse pressurization chambers . Where do they lead ? To the depository . Perfect . Rygel ? Pick up Zhaan and Stark from the waste vents , and come and get us when Talyn 's finished . Finished with what ? Don 't ask . Crais- - target off my comms and destroy the depository . Talyn 's firepower is massive , Aeryn . How will you survive the damage ? We 'll be safe . Just give us ninety microts , and obviously , try not to hit my signal with a direct strike . " You want the chip gone . " All right ! Follow me . Follow you where ? Here ! Go down to the depository ; hide in a container . That should protect us from Talyn 's attack . Should ? You got a better idea ? Aeryn ... I 'm , ah I 'm gonna go to Scorpius . Frell you are . D 'Argo ... carry him ! It 's what Aeryn wants us to do , Pilot- - Destroy the entire building . This way ! It 's frelling locked ! They 're in the depositing room . Zhaan , I think we 've got company . Rygel ! Rygel ! Almost there Zhaan . Move ! Right , into the container . I didn 't plan on becoming a deposit . Touching down now , Zhaan . Let 's go ! Come on ! Talyn firing in 20 microts . Locking on now . Talyn firing in 15 microts . All right there in ! Let 's go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Wait for my signal . 10 microts ... Fire . Mine , mine , mine ! Can I have this ? Can this be mine ? We can all have anything we want now , right ? Any food , any female , anything ! Right ? Oh , don 't be like them ! You 're like me , Chiana . We did it ! This is not like before . This won 't eat the ship , so cheer up . We got Crichton back , and Aeryn , and D 'Argo , and Jothee ! And we 're rich ! Perfect . Yes , but Moya is still extremely ill . Pilot says that she may never fully recover . And Rorf and Teurac lost their lives . So ? They knew the risks . Don 't worry about Rorf and Teurac . On my oath , I will deliver their shares to their families . Farewell my friends , and thank you for teaching me to kill again . I have to thank you , Crais . If you hadn 't have returned , we all would be dead . As much as I 'd like to take credit for it , I did nothing . Your attack saved us . I had little control . Talyn came to free Moya , himself . You didn 't command him ? No , he acted alone . As much as any of us would want , he has the instincts of a warrior and does exactly as he pleases . How is ... Crichton ? I 've brought my son , Jothee ... to thank you . I 'm ... crazy ... all for the love of ... ) He 's here , and um , he blames me . He blames me for killing Scorpius . And , so- - I 've been , I 've been trying to- - but , but I can 't , I can 't- - To , what ? To , what , John ?

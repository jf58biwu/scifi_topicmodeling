 Season 5 - Episode 9 The Sting A hush comes over the crowd . The only sound is Bender calling everyone else a jerk as he swings ! And he slices it ... into the water , duh ! Man ! Bad news , everyone ! You 're not good enough to go on your next mission . Not good enough ! Why ? Says who ! Because ! And says me ! It 's an extremely dangerous mission that killed my last crew . And you 're not nearly as good as them . We live to suck an another day ! We are just as good as any others crews you sent to their deaths . - What 's the mission ? - Collectiong honey . Ordinary honey . That doesn 't sound so dangerous . This is no ordinary honey ! It 's produced by vicious spaces bees . A single sting of their hideous neurotoxin can cause instant death ! And that 's if you 're not allergic ! You don 't wanna know what happens then oh no no , God no ! Your insides will boil out of your eye sockets like a science fair volcano ! I didn 't want to know ! These bees are larger than most Buicks ! and twice as ugly . Larger than an american sedan ? How big is the honeycomb ? Honeycomb 's big . Yeah , yeah , yeah ! - It 's not small ? - No , no , no . It don 't take more than deadly deadly bees to keep us from doing our job . - Come on , boys ! - But Leela , we 're no good ! Listen , I 'm scared too . But I 'm more scared of disappointing myself . I 'm not scared of that at all ! Now , bees communicate by dancing . Like my parents ! Wait ! That was hitting ! So the language cartridge will let you distract them . Ah good ! I often have toughts and feelings that can only be expressed through dance ! Bender ! Quick ! Waggle something ! Leela , let 's turn back , there 's absolutly no shame in wussing out . Relax . Everything will be fine . Oh my God ! The old Planet Express ship . There 's the blackbox . " Captain , the bees have us surrounded . " " The professor was right . We 're not as good as his old crew . " " Well I aim to proove him wrong . It 'll take more than a few deadly deadly bees to ... " Couldn 't make that out . Too much static ! We found it ! The honeycomb hide-out ! - Hey , what 's this goop ? - Royal jelly . They feed it to the queen . Bees made honey and jelly ? How come nothing humans make taste good ? Help ! I can 't swim in jelly as far as I know ! Look ! It 's a baby queen . She 's so cute ! You adorable wittle itty bitty fuzzy wuzzy ... Leela , stop bonding and let 's go ! I got jelly in my underpants ! I 'm taking this bee with us . With a queen we can build a hive and make more honey ourselves . Let me just pack her a lunch and we 'll go . Pick up the pace lady ! I didn 't mean you 're all fat . It 's just fatso there . This is where we 're distinguishing ourselves from the last crew . Activate emergency high-speed self-contained escape pack crisis response unit . Quick ! Good luck , Bender ! I 'm back , baby . We made it , we 're alive ! Burn out that old crew ! The only things they did better than us were suck and die . Leela , we got lucky this time , but you should be more careful . I don 't want anything to happen to you . Thanks , but I can look out for myself . Frankly , I can smell danger a mile away . Look out ! You want her ? You 'll have to go through me ! You call that a wound ? That 's a boo boo tops ! But thanks for trying to save me , Fry ! He 's ... He 's dead ! Who will make Bender waffles just the way he likes them now ? It was all my fault ! He died because of me ! No , no , no ... I 'm lying to make her feel better ! Husband , can 't you go anywhere without lighting something up ? It 's an old Jamaican accounting tradition . We burn his timecard . That way , his zombie doesn 't come back looking for his final paycheque . He looks so natural . It 's funny to think he 's crammed full of sawdust and preservatives . I only wish I could 've removed the stinger . I barely knew Philip , but as a clergyman I have no problems telling his most intimate friends all about him . Soothe us with sweet lies . It may comfort you to know Fry 's death took only 15 seconds . Yet the pain was so intense that it felt to him like 15 years . And it goes without saying , it caused him to empty his bowels . We now commend Fry 's body to the ages . He 's walking on sunshine now . This makes me the oldest member of my family . Him do good snoo-snoo . All those times , I said " Kill all humans " , I 'd always whisper " expect one " . Fry was that one ... and I never told him so . Farewell from the world of tomorrow ! They say a spoonful of space honey helps ease the pain . It 's good ! I feel funny . How funny ! I tought you were dead . No , I 'm better than ever . Before the accident , I couldn 't do this ! Impressive . But it does sort a support my You-Are-Dead theory . I will proove I 'm alive , by telling you something only I could know . There is a surprise for you in my locker . I got it at swedish novelty shop before he left . It 's too beautiful to open . - Can I open it ? - Sure . There is only one thing I want you to do . - What ? - I want you to wake up . Wake up ? But I 'm not ... In my dream , Fry said he hid a gift from me in his locker . If it 's true , then he must still exist in some form . Of course he still exists . As a frozen corpse in outer space ! I made myself sad . Well , here goes . Bupkis ! Well , I feel better now . Pawning all this stuff in Fry 's locker helped give me closure . Was there anything in there that might have been a gift for me ? No . Nothing . Not at all . No way jose ! Here it is . You took this from Fry 's locker ! ? Hey , the guy 's dead . There 's no law against grave robbing ! That proves it . Fry is alive somewhere , and he 's reaching me in my dreams . Bullpies ! Lay down here and we 'll do some tests . If Fry is out there somewhere , Leela 's brain could be acting like as five-pounds ouija board . Is this some sort of brain scanner ? Some sort , yes . In France it 's called a guillotine . Professor ! Can 't you examine my brain without removing it ? Yes , easily . Hey ! What if Fry wasn 't actually dead when we buried him ? You know , like Julia Roberts . Well , I suppose there 's a slim ... I don 't believe it ! What is it ? Is Fry alive in some other dimension or something ? No ! According to this gizmo-meter , Fry is dead and nothing can bring him back . - Remarkable ! - But ... My dream ! Your science can 't unprove that ! How could I have know the gift was in Fry 's locker ? Easy . He told you about it before he died and your grief-roasted mind block it out ! Are you saying ... I 'm going crazy ? No ! No one 's saying that . But I 'm certainly thinking it loudly . Hi Leela ! I 'm gonna keep talking , even if you can 't here me ! Shut up , I can hear you ! The Professor says you 're just a dream . Oh yeah ? Could a dream take you dancing in an illusion garden ? Well , yes technically . But it 's still very sweat of you . Then what if me shared a midnight sleigh ride across the ice field of Hiperia ? Oh Fry , you must be alive , I 've never been treated so romantically by my own imagination before . Here , take my jacket . You look a little cold . Thank you . It 's all so beautiful . I 've forgot how many hundreds of degrees below zero it must be . I just wish I could convice the other you 're alive . You can . All you have to do is wake up . No ! No ! Don 't say that ! This is real ! Not an other dream ! Fry 's jacket ! The one he was burried in . My dream was real ! He 's alive ! Quit your bragging , my boyfriend 's alive too . Not anymore . That 's better . Fry is alive ! I have proof ! You do not ! I 'm from Jama√Øca the show-me island , so show me you 're blowing it out your fanny . But he gave me his jacket , look ! That 's not Fry 's jacket . Fry 's jacket is read . That 's your jacket . An off the rack lime green affair . But Fry ... his jacket ... And when I woke up , it was on me ! You 're under a lot of gilted stress , Leela . Here , work it off . I am not under stress , damn it ! Everything gonna be alright , Leela . - What ? - I said : everything gonna be alright . Maybe I 'm freaking out a little . A little ? You 're screwier than my aunt Rita . She 's a screw . I need to calm down . I 'm gonna take some more of that space honey . You 've been taking space honey ? Be careful you purple haired imbecile ! One spoonful calms you down . Two spoonfuls help you sleep . But three spoonfuls and you 're going into a sleep so deep ... you 're never wake up . Never ! One spoonful to calm me down . I 've got a pretty good calm going ! 2 spoonfuls to help me sleep . Still awake . I guess one more spoon full couldn 't hurt . Oh my gosh ! I 'd better get a sponge ! Is that you ? I don 't need a sponge ! Why am I sticky and naked ? Did I miss something fun ? Incredible ! According to the gizmo-meter Fry touched the royal jelly in the space hive , leaving an imprint of his DNA and brainwaves . Then when it spilled on the couch , it recombines with trace amounts of Fry 's hair and skin . And blood . Don 't forget about Fry 's blood ! Yes Bender . Thank you . In short , the various fluids Fry left in the couch caused the royal jelly to regenerate his entire being ! Neat ! This is great ! My buddy is alive an his credit cards are valuable again ! Let 's go get hamered ! I should warn you , I 'm a mean drunk . - I 'm so glad I didn 't kill you . - Me too ! Felling responsible for your death was driving me mad ! But now everything is alright ! Not everything . What ? What do you mean ? You have to wake up ! Wake up ? Oh , no , no . It can 't be ... I 'm cracking up . In my dreams I 'm happy because Fry is alive , but when I 'm awake , my mind plays tricks on me . Take it easy Leela . In every life we have some trouble . But when you worry , you make it double . Don 't worry , be happy ! The landlords says your rent is late . You may have to litigate . But don 't worry ! Bee happy ! Ain 't got no cash , ain 't got no style . Ladies vomit when I smile . But does Zoidberg worry ? Feh ! You wish . Bee Happy ! Don 't worry now , Amy ! Ok , I 'm happy ! Take us home , Bender ! Don 't worry ! Bee happy ! Were you just singing ? No . I was telling you not to worry . I 'm not allowed to sing . Court order . I 'll find Fry 's coffin , get his corpse and keep it under my mattress to remind me that he 's really dead . That 'll prove I 'm not insane ! OK . It 's just an ordinary coffin . Containing my ordinary dead friend . Who I killed . What happened ? Why am I at my apartment ? You killed Fry ! Stop it ! You killed Fry . OK , I 'm insane . But I 'm still sane enough to know it . The only time I feel alright is in my dreams . With you . 3 spoonfuls , then ... I can dream forever . one two ... Here goes ! Goodbye waking world ! Leela , no ! Listen to me ! You don 't wanna lie in bed like a vegetable and do nothing the rest of your life . I 've tried it . Bedsores hurt ! What am I supposed to do ? - Fight it ! - I can 't ! You can . The Leela I know doesn 't give up this easily . OK , I 'll try . Go away ! I don 't know if you can hear me Leela , but there is something that I want to tell you . I love you . I 'm so scared Fry , I don 't know what to do ! Just wake up Leela , please , just wake up . I don 't understand what you mean ! Just wake up , please , just wake up Leela . You 're alive . You 're awake . Of course I 'm awake , you wouldn 't stop waking me . - Where am I ? - In an hospital . The ambulance brought you here right out after the bee stung you . But the bee stung YOU . It barely touched me . The sting went right through me and you got all the poison . My new spleen came from a guy who liked the motorcycle . Sweet three-toed sloth of ice planet Hoth ! She 's awake ! You wera in the best coma I 've ever seen ! The doctor said you 'd never wake up . Really ? How long was I out ? 2 weeks . Fry never left your side for a minute . And he talked non-stop , like a parrot of the sea he was . I thought maybe if you heard a familiar voice , it might help keep your mind together . But who knows if it really got through ? It got through , Fry ... It got through ... You could really use a shower . You too . June 21th , 2003 - v1.5

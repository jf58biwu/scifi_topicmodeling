 Previously on Jake 2.0 I 'm Jake Foley , tech support . I see you 're still at the NSA . We have a problem . You see how the nanites have positioned themselves along his central nervous system . This guy can interface with technology . He 's like a universal remote , and every one of his body functions is enhanced . I 've just been authorized to create a special ops team with you at its core . Drop your weapon and hand over the pouch . What ? ! No , no , no . Oh , man . You 're not listening . You 've failed the simulator again . I keep telling you , always count your shots , Jake . Twelve in the mag , one in the pipe . I know , it 's just ... All right , look , I messed up , okay ? But did you see that jump ? I mean , come on . It ... Yeah , yeah . I did ; it was impressive , but in the real world , you 're dead . What do they want ? We 've got a guy with a half billion dollars ' worth of nanotechnology inside of him . They want results . Oh , we 're getting results , honestly . Just look at what he can do . Here . Okay , see this ? It 's what I use to monitor Jake and track his vitals and stuff like that . Okay , so ... look here . His breathing is normal for this level of exertion . His heart rate 's 103 . Now , here ... This is when he sees the rocket grenade thing - whatever you call it - and his adrenals are up 300 % instantly . That is the nanites triggering his adrenal glands . I mean , Jake 's muscles are not any different than yours or mine , but you hit him with this much adrenaline , and , I mean , their performance just increases tenfold , and the same goes for his sight and hearing . I mean , the nanites simply enhance all of his existing functions . It 's technology at its best . It 's ... - it 's beautiful . - It 's unpredictable . Diane , he was dropped to his knees by one of our metal detectors . Yeah , I 'm , uh ... I 'm working on that , but you have to understand that the nanites are molecular computers , which makes him susceptible to the same kinds of things as , well , your average desktop - I mean , electromagnetic waves , and power surges , and viruses ... the hacking - well , technically - I mean , the chances of that , I think , are really low , and-and I don 't even know how an outsider would even know that ... Okay , okay . Kyle ? Yeah , he 's strong ; he 's fast ... but I 'm concerned about his instincts . He has yet to beat the simulator room , and he can barely bring himself to hit someone . I 'm afraid that if we put him in the field , he 'll be a danger to himself - and any other agent he 's with . - Enough , enough . - All he needs is more time . - He 's had three weeks . - They 're giving us one more . - What ? Diane , they want to see a demonstration . If we can 't prove Jake 's a viable use for this technology , they 're going to shut us down . You 're going to shut down my program ? This is years ' worth of research . Well , they would continue to study him in a controlled environment . What - they 're going to lock him up in a room like a lab rat ? Wh ... he 's a human being . They-they ... they can 't do that . Oh , they can , and they will . Oh , yeah , we 're still having some trouble with the cramping , and ... That 's me . Jake Foley , I 'm in Tech Support . Security Clearance : Low . Very low . Then one day , it all changed . Now , I can do things I 've never dreamed of . I 've been upgraded . I have these powers . Life just got real interesting . " Sandstorm " in position . Copy that , Sandstorm . Look , we 're still not able to get a read on that inside heat signature . - Please stand by . - Standing by . - What 's going on ? - It 's Al Juhuara - a terrorist cell in Tunisia . They 've gotten their hands on one of our EMPs . Electromagnetic pulse bomb ? That 's right . We 're going to get it back . We only got a half an hour of darkness left , and coming home empty-handed is not an option . Request permission to proceed . Well , that 's not how I 'd like to go in , but it is your call , Sandstorm . Don 't worry yourself , Chief . No worries here ... and just a reminder , you are authorized - for flash and bang only . - Copy that . - Percussive grenades ? - Yeah . They want to stun the guards - before storming the compound . - Oh , that 's a good idea . Okay , boys , let 's go wake ' em up . Come in , Sandstorm . Sandstorm , come in . Sandstorm , do you copy ? Yeah , I copy . Sorry . Looks like I got a little sand in my radio . Well , I 'll tell you what . You bring it home , and I 'll clean it myself . I 'll take you up on that , chief . We got the target in good hands . Request permission to head home . Good work . How unbelievable . Well , that 's what real agents do . " That 's what real agents do , Jake . " " In the real world , you 'd be dead , Jake . " Oh . Hello ? Okay , I know you 're going to think I 'm a total idiot , but where is my " C : " Drive ? Uh , it 's in your computer . No . It isn 't showing up . Uh , oh-oh , um , hit control function 8 all at the same time . There it is . Jake , you 're amazing . I try . I miss seeing you . - You do ? - Yeah . Can I take you to lunch ? I 'd love to catch up . Um , okay . - Are you free tomorrow ? - Yeah . How ' bout , um , 1 : 00 at Mick 's ? Yeah , okay , sure . That sounds fine . All right , uh , I 'll see you then . Bye . - Hey . - Hi . Uh ... I didn 't mean to interrupt . I-I just was on my way home , uh ... sort of . I actually live on the other side of the hill , but , uh ... I picked this up on the weekend . - It 's a desk lamp . - That 's ... really nice . Thanks . Welcome . Do you want to come inside ? Yeah . This is going to look great ... well , when I have a desk . Can I get you something to drink ? - Uh , yeah , just water is fine . - Okay . I haven 't unpacked my glasses yet . I 've kind of been drinking out of the faucet . Oh , I 'm good then . You know what ? I 'm going to find you one . Hold on . I guess you can probably kiss the security deposit good-bye , huh ? Yeah , I don 't really know my own strength anymore . Well , you 'll get used to it . Yeah , I was thinking that , this whole thing 's really weird , 'cause - ' cause I come home from work one day , and all my stuff 's packed up in boxes , and my roommate 's been transferred out of the country , and then I 'm forced to come live here , 'cause it 's supposedly a more secure location above Luigi 's Deli . You smell that ? I do . Twenty-four hours a day . Well , all things considered , I think that you 're handling things pretty well , um ... Diane , you don 't have to say that . I saw the way you guys were looking at me today , and it 's pretty clear that , uh , even if I wanted to be an Agent my entire life , I may just not be cut out for it . Jake ... do you know what happens if you don 't make it ? What ? I don 't get my Nobel Prize , and I really want my Nobel Prize , you know - I-I want the-the fame , and I want the money , and I really want the medal ... So this whole " I don 't think I can make it " thing - I think you better lose it , or I 'm going to have to kick your nanobot butt , okay ? What 's the deal with the TV ? Oh , yeah , the TV . Well , uh , the cable guy was supposed to come by - twice - but , uh , you know how that goes . You know that you could just ... fix it yourself . Wouldn 't that be illegal ? Uh , shouldn 't it be illegal for the cable guy to make you wait around all day and not show up ? Good point . There you go . You want to stick around for a while , watch some TV ? Yeah . Yeah . So is , is this the place where you tell me my mission , should I choose to accept it ? Right . Armory access open . Cool . Wow . Ah , this is where we get our side arms . It 's where I get mine . Right . Well , I guess as long as we 're together , then , uh , I 'm covered . Vault Access Open . What 's in there ? It 's the most secure vault in the building : Three feet of lead and steel , impenetrable to any and all types of blasts . Cool . I just can 't get over that Agent Wright . I mean , the guy is awesome . Hey , you ever think they 'll ever send me to Tunisia or someplace like Tunisia , someplace exotic ? Jake , this is the NSA . We 're the largest and most powerful intelligence agency in the world . There are 46,000 people working here , all charged with the awesome responsibility of keeping this nation safe . Not one of them , including myself , is concerned with whether or not you 'll be sent someplace " exotic " . Right ... no , of course . Hey , so , Kyle , what are we doing here ? Is something going down , or ... Look around , Jake . Tell me what you see . Okay , uh ... I see , uh , mom pushing a baby in her stroller ... some ... businessmen , probably on lunch break . There 's , uh , woman jogging - she 's kind of hot . Not that it matters . Does it ? I don 't know . Let me tell you what I see . Six people on cell phones . Any of them could be ordering a hit . Three backpacks and a baby carriage , each large enough to hold enough C-4 to level a city block . Right . Now , as to the reason we 're here . The NSA intercepted a phone call . An unidentified state department official is attempting to sell some information . That exchange is going down here . We have two agents covering the north end . You and I will cover the south . Okay . Jake , this may be our only chance at this guy . You understand ? Yeah , yes , yes , yes , sir . Absolutely , I 'm ready . - Good . - Let 's go . Let 's do this . Oh , let 's do this . Yeah . Take it . So this is everything ? It 's all there . Nobody can know about this . Of course not . Kyle . Kyle ! Kyle ... Kyle ! Kyle , I got him ! - Everybody down ! Federal agent ! - Hey stop ! - Hand it over ! - What ? I 'm with the NSA , pal . I saw everything . - Jake , what are you doing ? - I got him Kyle . I got him . Jake , he 's not even one of ours . One of ours ? We 're running a training operation , sir . - It 's a case of a mistaken identity . - Mistaken identity . - We apologize . - You 're going to hear from my lawyers . That 's what you 're going to hear from . That 's great . That 's great . You 've managed to catch a hot dog - vendor paying off his bookie . - Well , it sounded like a drop , okay ? Jake , think . Now would a real drop sound like one ? - Huh ? Would it be that obvious ? - Maybe , I don 't know . What do you want from me ? I want you to step up . Okay ? Dig deeper . Jake , I want you to learn to look beyond the obvious . SandOps . This is Sandstorm . We 're headed home with the device . Copy that . There you go , sir . Agent Wright , would you care for anything else before we land ? No , thank you . So sorry about that . All right , let 's go again . You 're pretty stressed . I figure we should just take a break . No , I 'm fine . Let 's go again . Okay . Go . Come on . Let 's do it . Okay , just breathe . Just take it easy . Come on . No , damn it ! All right , you know , that 's it . That 's enough . - Why does it keep doing that ? ! - Because interfacing wirelessly , especially when the nanites are operating at this many computations per second , it 's very taxing . They have to shut themselves down to keep from overloading . - Well , why don 't you increase the threshold ? - Can 't do that . What do you mean you can 't ? - It 's new technology . - Diane , I need help . I don 't know how . This was Dr. Gage 's project , and I came in early on as his post-doc but I just ... I don 't know it like he does , and I can 't ask him because he 's kind of dead so I 'm the best that you got , and I 'm telling you , Jake , I am doing everything that I can to help you , but you just , you can 't rely on me to make this happen , and you can 't rely on the nanites . Hey now , you don 't understand . I am messing up out there , and the only reason I 'm still here is ' cause of the nanites . You know what ? You 're an idiot . Ow ! What , so are we done ? I guess we are . You guys done here ? Yes . Ow ! Damn . We 've got something . Are we going somewhere cause I kind of have something . At 1 : 00 . Lunch with Sarah Carter . I 'll drive . What do you know about Sarah ? She attended Georgetown University , graduated in 1999 with you . Currently the legislative director for Senator Thompson . You have a thing for her . She trusts you . That works in our favor . What ? Your friend 's been investigating DoD funds that were diverted to us for the nanotechnology project . That 's highly classified . Your objective is to stop her investigation . - What 's this ? - Your cover . My cover . You want me to lie to my friend ? I 'll be listening . Oh , thanks . Isn 't this great ? Just the two of us . Yeah , yeah . Just the two of us . So how are things at work ? Oh yeah , same old same old . You know , just trying to keep the nation 's computers up and running . How about ... how about you ? Are you-you still seeing that guy ? No . He was , um ... I don 't know . I just didn 't trust him . How about you ? Oh , no . You can ... you can trust me . No . No . I mean , are you seeing anyone ? Oh , oh . No . No . I kind of feel like I 'm being consumed by my work . That 's this town , Jake . That 's what it does to you . Do you remember when the most important thing was how to get beer on a Friday night ? - Jake , get on with it . - Okay . What ? Oh , I-I-I meant , um , yeah , yeah . I remember what that was like back in college with the-the ... beer . Oh , I 'm sorry . I have to get this . Hello . I told you I 'd have the stats by friday . All right , look , you 're not helping me . I can do this , but you have to get off my back . Yeah , I know . I know . I am . And just for the record , all this training stuff - you 're not so good at it , okay ? Are you okay ? Yeah . Yeah . You know what ? You know when you 're working on a problem , and you 're kind of talking to yourself ? No . Uh , not really . So what 's the problem ? Actually , uh ... actually , it was something I wanted to talk to you about . Okay . Um , well , I came ... I came across something at work , and , um ... I think it has something to do with those missing funds you were looking into . - You did ? - Yeah . The thing is , it 's actually kind of silly . Well-well , the NSA wanted to upgrade some computer systems , but they didn 't want the CIA to find out about it , because they-they want the same thing , so ... they hid the funds . I don 't believe it . Yeah . Really competitive over there . No . I mean , I don 't believe it , Jake . They wouldn 't come after me over something like that . That 's a good point . But , uh , Sarah , you have to realize that these computers - they 're really big and expensive . No , Jake . It 's not true . I know . I have a source . A source ? You sure it 's someone you can trust ? ' Cause , Sarah , the-the Intel that I have is-is really supposed to be really reliable . Great story , Kyle . Worked like a charm . I think it did . What ? ! Were you listening ? She 's not going to quit . She has a source . She has a source . Congratulations . You did good . Hello . SandStorm has been compromised . - Where ? - National Park . I 'm on my way . What do we know at this point . At least five people were killed in the crash . Alright , listen up , people . We suffered a terrible blast today . Agents Wright , Tishler and Garcia are dead . We believe the person responsible for this took possession of an EMP and parachuted from the plane . I 've notified the CIA and the National Security Advisor . This is a code red threat to our nation 's capital . Let 's get in front of it . You want me to notify their families ? - No . I 'll take care of it . - Okay . Hello , Gwen ? This is Lou Beckett . I 'm afraid I have some very sad news about Nicholas . It happened at 11 : 35 ... They cut off his hand . Yeah . We got to get this guy . The missing electromagnetic pulse bomb is a class D portable , similar to larger devices we used in Iraq . Now this one has a blast radius of approximately two miles . Any electronic device within that perimeter will be disabled . Now as you can imagine , detonation almost anywhere in the D.C. Area could be devastating . Now , fortunately for us , we built it , - so there are some fail-safes . - Like what ? Well , first , there 's an encrypted warning beacon . If he tries to arm it , we 'll get a signal . Giving us how much time to find it and shut it down ? Twenty minutes . - What 's the other fail-safe ? - Well , that one might not necessarily work in our favor . In order to shut it down , you need the right codes . Enter the wrong code , it accelerates the timer . And there 's no turning it off . - Get the codes . - Yes , sir . Who are we looking for ? We picked up a security cam image in airport in Tunis . We believe it 's Abdul Tiranzi , Al Juhuara 's chief weapons expert . Tiranzi . Advanced Engineering Degrees . Helped the Chinese design their long-range missiles . His mother 's an American . Why is he listed as " possibly deceased ? " The Israelis have targeted him several times , but they 've never confirmed his death . They did get his brother last year . - Was his brother Al Juhuara ? - No . He was a professor in Gaza . It was a mistake . - What happened ? - Bad intel . From us . Great . So now he 's really pissed . I want Tiranzi 's photo out in the field . Maybe we 'll get lucky . It 's the warning beacon . He just armed it . Take whoever you need and get out there . Leland , Carvallo , Wallace - let 's go . He 's turning South on 18th street . Copy that . Target 's on the northeast corner of 19th and M. - You have 12 minutes . - Got it . - Has Alan got those codes ? - I need two more minutes . We 'll make it . - Hey , are you doing okay ? - Yeah , fine . Well , your blood pressure 's a little high . Yeah , probably ' cause I 'm standing around here doing nothing . - Well , you 're still in training . - I could be in training forever . Kyle will never believe I 've got what it takes . Jake , Kyle fought for you . I mean , when this accident happened and none of us knew what to do with you , he 's the one that wanted to make you an agent . He knew how badly you wanted this . - He 's moving . - Where ? - South on 19th . - We 're on it . He 's making a left on Pennsylvania . He 's heading for the White House . You can outflank him at 18th . Copy that . Doing it now . Come on . Hey , on the ground now ! On the ground ! Dude , chill ! It was just a stop sign ! Get down ! Don 't you move ! Watch him . We got the case . We have a problem . There 's no EMP ; it 's just a transmitter . He 's replicating the warning beacon . We got another one at the pentagon . And congress . Check them all out . Get every available agent on it now . Fifty feet right in front of you . I 'm on it . What do you have ? Do you have anything ? No , just another transmitter . Watch quadrant D. Nothing . Just another transmitter . Ortiz , where are you ? Yo , nothing here . Another transmitter . What ? What 's wrong ? This guy is drawing all our available agents into the field . - And ... ? - And ... I-it , it 's too obvious . He wants all our attention out there . He wants all of us out there . Why ? Because the target 's not out there . The target 's here , where we 're most vulnerable . He detonates that bomb inside the NSA , we lose all our satellite links , all our communications . There 's a worldwide security blackout . Al Juhuara has free rein . How would he ever get in here ? He knows exactly how . Level five , the mainframe ... Agent Wright admitted 1723 p.m. He 's here . Call Kyle . Tell him what 's going on , and evacuate the building . Jake ! Oh ... Hello sir . Mainframe Access . Open . Please proceed to the nearest exit . Going somewhere with that ? I guess not . I 'll have days , maybe weeks ... with nobody watching . Your world will never be the same . Don 't tell me you 're the best they 've got . Mainframe Access Open . Vault Access Open . Hey , come on . You 've got to get out of here . Freeze ! Federal Agent ! You should always count your shots . 12 in the mag ... One in the pipe . You are so lucky . A slightly larger dose of that EMP , I think would have put you out for good . But as it is now , all we need 's a little reprogramming . Thank you . It 's nothing . We can take care of it tomorrow . Uh , no . I meant for believing in me ... and ... putting up with me . Well , we 're in this together , right ? Right . Lou wants to see you . I lost three agents to this operation , Jake . Three very gifted agents . Fortunately , I found one , too . Congratulations , Agent Foley . Thanks . You did good . So , how 'd you know ? Looked beyond the obvious . - Oh . Congratulations . - Thank you . - It 's good . - Yeah . Oh , hey . Congratulations . Thanks , thanks a lot . Thank you . - Thank you . - Oh , goodness , hi . Thank you . Thanks . Thanks a lot . Thank you , thank you . Oh , thanks . - Who is it ? - Cable guy . Uh , just a second .

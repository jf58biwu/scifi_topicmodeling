 Holy Ghost , come to me . Praise God . Praise God . Move up on me , Holy Ghost . Praise God . This here sinner repents . Holy Ghost , move up on me . Protect me and mine with your quickening power . Holy Ghost , come to me . Aah ! Oh , help me , Jesus ! Oh , help me , Jesus ! Help me , Jesus ! Not as far as you know . Right . Not this time of year . All right . Thank you , Doctor . Good-bye . Snakes . Lots and lots of snakes . Very pissed-off ones , from the look of it . It 's the former Mr. Jared Chirp of McMinn County , Tennessee . - Oh , my God . - 116 separate bite marks . Judging from the wound measurements , there were 50 different snakes involved , mostly copperheads and rattlers . But it says here that he was found dead in his car . Yeah , with a pistol in his hand . He fired six shots into the floorboards , into the passenger seat , even into his own right kneecap . The windows were shut and the doors were locked . But what happened to all the snakes ? No one seems to know that . There was not a scale found . I just got off the phone with a herpetologist at the Smithsonian , and he 's stumped , especially because these rattlesnakes tend to hibernate in winter . So you think that Mr. Chirp was murdered . It certainly would appear that way , but the question is how . There 's no physical evidence at all ... no tire tracks , no footprints . I can 't see how anyone could 've accomplished this . Then you gotta ask yourself why . Why would anybody use poisonous snakes as a murder weapon ? Maybe it 's symbolic . I mean , serpents and religion have gone hand in hand . They 've represented the temptation of Eve , original sin . They 've been feared and hated throughout history , as they 've been thought to embody Satan ... to serve evil itself . Maybe these ones actually do . These particular serpents actually were serving evil ? Are you gonna type that on our travel request ? No . But at the very least this case does seem to center around religion , and you 're not the only one to think that , by the way . Jared is in a better place now , Gracie . He 's at peace . You know Reverend Mackey 's right , honey . He is in a better place . Reverend Samuel Mackey ? My name is Fox Mulder . This is Dana Scully . We 're with the F.B.I. May we speak with you , sir ? Come on , Gracie . Let 's get you home . We apologize for our timing . We 'd like to ask you a few questions aboutJared Chirp . I 've already spoken to the sheriff about it , though I 'm not sure that that was a good idea . Specifically , you had suspicions about the manner in which he died ? I should be the last one to point a finger or say a harsh word . Our church is founded on acceptance and tolerance ... - Of all people , all beliefs . - But ? BeforeJared joined us , he belonged to a fundamentalist congregation outside of town , the Church of God with Signs Wonders . It practices snake handling . As a sign of faith , worshippers handle deadly snakes or drink poison . They believe that the Holy Spirit protects the righteous . Jared grew up in that church , but it is very difficult ... to walk away from a belief system that one is raised in . It takes great courage . Why did he walk away ? He and Gracie , his girlfriend , left it together . They found that a rigid interpretation of the Bible was not for them , especially when it involves risking life and limb in the act of worship . But , again , it is not for me to judge . I will say , however , that both Jared and Gracie ... were persecuted by the members of their former church . All this animus ... stems from their church leader , Enoch O 'Connor . Animus enough to motivate a murder ? Snake handling . We didn 't learn that in catechism class . That 's funny , I knew a couple Catholic schoolgirls who were expert at it . Enoch O 'Connor ? Federal agents . Where 's the light switch ? The nearest one ? Probably ten miles from here . Yeah . All right . Rattlesnakes and medieval visions of damnation . I , for one , feel a whole lot closer to God . I don 't know , Scully . When you get right down to it , is snake handling any harder to buy into than ... communion wafers or transubstantiation ... Or believing in flying saucers , for that matter . I 'm just saying that your faith and O 'Connor 's seem ... to be based on the same book . Uh-oh , Scully . What do you think O 'Connor keeps in here ? Something slithery ? - It 's all right . It 's empty . - Why is it empty ? By what right are you here ? Reverend Enoch O 'Connor , we 're federal agents . We 're , uh , with the F.B.I. Reverend , do something about these snakes , please . You got nothing to fear if you 're righteous people . Just in case we 're not , we could use a little righteous help here . What do you want ? We 're here to ask you questions about a former member of your church ... Jared Chirp . That boy strayed from the path and was lost to the Dark One . I 'm sorry for his soul . - There ain 't much else to say . - He died from multiple snake bites . We thought maybe you 'd have a special insight into that . I do . - It was a test . - Test ? What do you mean ? A test of faith . A test of righteousness . When the devil aims to test you , you best be ready . And you sure better know which side you 're on . You speaking about the devil 's test or your test ? I don 't think you people realize which side you 're on . I do . You can leave now . Tennessee . Snakes . Thank you , Mulder . Thank you so much . I say we arrest him and catch the first flight out of here . He does seem like a likely suspect , only the local sheriff s office ruled him out . Apparently , he was in Kentucky the nightJared Chirp died . Mulder , there are other people in his congregation . Jared Chirp died with a packed suitcase by his side . There 's gotta be somebody that knows where he was headed . Here you go , honey . Reverend Mackey ? - This might not be the best time , but can I speak to you ? - Of course . Jared called the boardinghouse late the night he died . He wanted to talk to Gracie . I didn 't let him . It was after 2 : 00 . She was sound asleep , and it sounded to me like the boy had been drinkin ' . He just wasn 't makin ' any sense . He was ranting ' about seein ' the devil and paying ' for his sins . Iris , why didn 't you tell the police ? I don 't know how to tell Gracie . I kept her from speaking toJared his last night on earth . I couldn 't have known though . - I couldn 't have . - No , you couldn 't have known . I can help you talk to Gracie . - Reverend Mackey ? Everybody 's here . - Thank you , Gracie . You and I will see this through , Iris , right after study group . Thank you . - Our God is a fearsome God . - Amen ! He demands our very lives ! " ' Tis better to be hot or cold than lukewarm . " God says if you 're lukewarm ... he will vomit you out of his mouth ! Yes ! - Did you hear what I said ? - Praise God . Praise God . Yes . God hates the lukewarm ! " ' So , because you are lukewarm ... I am about to spit you out of my mouth . " ' Now , that could sound pretty harsh , couldn 't it ? I mean , depending on how one reads it . But if we put this verse in a historical context , I think we 'll see thatJohn was specifically addressing ... the problems of the church of Laodicea . God wants you hot ! God wants you on fire ! PraiseJesus ! God wants you to put your money ... where your mouth is ! People ask me why I handle snakes . - Hallelujah ! I tell ' em ... it 's ' cause the scripture tells me to ! Praise God ! He offers to join us , to come into our lives and dine with us ... if only we 'd open the door . Hallelujah ! Hallelujah ! The manner in which John ends this chapter , his emphasis is on teaching the church of Laodicea perseverance . He uses the word " overcome " not once , but twice . Good Lord , come save me I 'm comin 'to the light Good Lord , come save me I 'm comin ' to the light Sing songs of praise to the Lord Good Lord , I love you I know that you 're the light - Good Lord , I love you I know that you 're the light - Witness the power ! - Witness the awesome power ... of God as he blesses his people ... and destroys his enemies . Thank you , God ! I don 't understand it . None of us saw or heard anything . Just her scream . When we ran in , she was lying on the floor . I cleared everybody out of the building once I saw the bite marks , but ... Reverend , how close was Iris toJared Chirp ? Not particularly close , but I 'd spoken with her not 15 minutes earlier about him . - What 'd you talk about ? - She was upset . Something aboutJared calling her the night he died , looking for Gracie . Something about him paying ... for his sins . But I don 't know . We didn 't get to finish our conversation . Maybe that was the point . Why Iris ? Why is this happening ? Gracie , we 're investigating the leader of your former church , Enoch O 'Connor . We believe he may have had something to do with what happened here tonight . We would appreciate anything you could tell us about him . No , he didn 't do this . He didn 't do this . This is Satan 's work , not man 's . Gracie , that sounds like something Reverend O 'Connor might say . Now , you 're not a member of that congregation anymore . I understand this , because you 're someone who thinks for herself . Keeping an open mind , Gracie , is it conceivable that O 'Connor could 've done any of this ? No ! Don 't you think I would know ? Me , of all people ? He couldn 't have done this . He just couldn 't . - Gracie might be biased . - O 'Connor is your father . When Gracie got pregnant ... O 'Connor barred her from his church ... she and Jared Chirp . His church and his home . - You comin ' ? - I think I 'll check around back . " Pray for the souls ... lost to us . " Oh ! You must be judged ! Repent ! Pray for the Lord 's quickening power . To the hands of God . Let her go ! Your F.B.I. partner could 've learned something about herself ... if you hadn 't have stopped me . Some powerful good news , maybe . I 'd say it 's good news for you that she 's not here right now , considering what you tried to do to her . Is that what you did to your wife ? Alice O 'Connor . Succumbed to multiple snake bites inJune 1994 . It happened during a church service ... or at least , that 's what you told local police . You got away with it ... almost . What was , uh , the problem with your wife ? Was she not ... righteous enough for you ? Just like your daughter 's boyfriend ... or Iris Finster ? Educated man . Too smart to know any better . Smart enough to know you 're a murderer . Satan is near , and you don 't even have eyes . You 're just proud and fancy free . Man , no one quite passes muster with you , huh ? You feel the need to exact some kind of Old Testament revenge ? What about your daughter ? What were your plans for her ? I pray for her soul . I pray and I pray , because she 's lost . Because she no longer believes as you do ? You think because you 're educated , you 're better than most ? You ain 't . Unless you 're smart down here ... the devil 's gonna make a fool of you , and you ain 't even gonna know it . I changed my mind . I don 't want to see him . Besides , I won 't do any better than you people at getting him to talk . Gracie . You still don 't believe your father did it ? It don 't matter what I believe . He 'll be judged as he deserves . Can 't nobody avoid it . Help me , Jesus . Deputy found him about an hour ago . There 's no telling when he was attacked . I guess it 's looking less and less like he 's a suspect . Unless he somehow managed to do this to himself ... as a test of his own righteousness . Well , if so , Mulder , the jury 's still out . I just spoke to his doctors . - It 's a tossup as to whether he 's gonna pull through this . - What about antivenin treatment ? - He 's not receiving it . - Why not ? Gracie stepped in . She 's trying to forbid treatment on religious grounds . It 's not clear whether she has a legal claim to do it , but she says that ... it 's up to God as to whether he lives or dies . And you 're thinking that her actions may not be entirely motivated ... by concern for her father 's eternal soul ? Well , more to the point , Mulder , what if she did this ? She told me that her father would be judged as he deserves . - You think this is what she meant ? - She grew up around snakes . Who 's to say she isn 't every bit as adept at handling them as he is ? I can see her being angry enough at her father to attack him , but what about the others ? He left in a hurry . Packed one suitcase and a gun . Earlier that night he calls Gracie , gets Iris instead and starts rambling about paying for his sins . He 's frightened and wants to leave town , presumably with Gracie . So what 's he scared of ? I don 't understand how O 'Connor 's church ... exerts a strong pull on these people . - It 's not so hard to understand . It 's a culture with a very well-defined set of rules . - It 's an intolerant culture , Mulder . - I don 't know , Scully . Sometimes a little intolerance can be a welcome thing . Clear-cut right and wrong , black and white , no shades of gray . In a society where hard and fast rules are harder and harder to come by , - I think some people would appreciate that . - You 're saying that you , Fox Mulder , would welcome someone telling you what to believe ? I 'm just saying that somebody offering you all the answers ... can be a very powerful thing . Oh , it 's lab results . Am I reading this right ? DidJared Chirp have himself tested for sterility ? Which turns out to be more or less the case . Based on this , that means Jared can 't be the father of Gracie 's baby . It 's dated the day he died . So maybe he was killed because he discovered the truth . Gracie ... I 'd like to ask you to reconsider . No . This is what he 'd want . He may die without medical treatment . I 've seen him bit a dozen times . He always said that it was up to God ... whether he lives or dies . Said it was a worse sin not to trust God . There are many ways to trust God , Gracie . One of them is to trust in the miracles of doctors and medicine . Or in your heart ... do you really not want him to get better ? It ain 't for me . I can 't risk his soul . When you first came to me , you said that you wanted to think for yourself ... to live your life ... as you saw fit . If you stand here and let your father die , whose beliefs are you living ? Yours ... or his ? You 're doing the right thing . I 'll go tell the doctor , okay ? Agents , Enoch O 'Connor is gone . I was away for five minutes . His bed 's empty . Gracie is gone too . How could Gracie have possibly gotten him out of here ? - Maybe he took her . - He was on his deathbed . That 's impossible . And besides , what 's his motivation ? I may be able to answer that . Jared Chirp wasn 't the father of Gracie 's child . We know that . What about it ? Enoch O 'Connor is . That 's why she wanted to get away from him and his church ... as fast as she could . And I tried to teach her to forgive him . Uuh ! Daddy , please ! I 'm bringin ' you home . Somebody help me ! In the name of our holy and most fearsome God . Hallelujah ! Resist the devil and he will flee . Resist him ! Something 's wrong . Something 's wrong with my baby . Oh ! DearJesus , put your hands on this woman . You can heal her . Oh , yes , God . That 's it . Yes , Jesus . Yes , Jesus . O Lord . Dear Lord . DearJesus , deliver this woman . Jesus . Jesus . Yes , Lord . Yes , Jesus . - No ! Don 't , don 't ! - Dear God . Dear Heavenly Father , deliver this woman . Lay your hands on this woman . - God ! Yes ! - No ! - Don 't ! Don 't ! - Yes . Hallelujah . Praise the Lord . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . DearJesus . DearJesus . HolyJesus ! Hallelujah ! DearJesus ! Hallelujah ! Hallelujah ! Hallelujah ! DearJesus ! - How is she ? - Deep shock and some loss of blood . What happened here ? - Where 's the baby ? - These folks aren 't talkin ' . Scully . Take a look at this . Snakes . She gave birth to snakes ? The devil has been cast out . Stay with her . - Where are you going ? - To find her father . He 's gonna wanna tie up some loose ends . You stole what was most precious to me . Gracie ? She came to me on her own . - She wanted to escape a life of fear ... and judgment , of intolerance . - Please , O God ... - She fled a harsh and vengeful God ... and you . Drop the knife ! Uuh ! You all right ? - Daddy ? - Daddy ? - Gracie , it 's Agent Scully . We 're taking you to the doctor right now , okay ? - No , I gotta ... - Can you tell me what happened , Gracie ? Ohh ! - Where 's my daddy ? - You 're safe , Gracie . My partner 's gone after him . Gracie , you 're gonna be okay . He can 't hurt you anymore . You don 't understand . He saved me . I 'll call for an ambulance . Relax . Help 's on the way . No , it 's not . I told you , boy , you still don 't know which side you 're on . Be smart . Down here . Yes , please hurry . They 're on their way . - Agent . - It wasn 't O 'Connor . It was you . You killed Jared Chirp . - You 're joking . - No . I 'm just beginning to see it now . Jared must 've come to understand that he wasn 't the father of Gracie 's baby ... that you were . Did he confront you earlier that night , only to see you for who you really are ? Just who is it you think I am ? Is that what happened with Iris Finster ? Was she beginning to catch on ? Is that why you killed her ? Or was it just to further frame Enoch O 'Connor ? Is that was this is really about ? Ruining O 'Connor ? Seducing his daughter ? Destroying him by any conceivable means ? - Are you a righteous man , Agent Mulder ? - Stay where you are . It 's just a simple question . Most people believe they 're on the side of angels . But are they ? If you were put to the test , how would you do ? - Aah ... aah ! Where 's Mulder ? - Help ! - No ! You can 't help him . This is his alone . Mulder ! Aah ! - Mackey ? - No , still no trace , even though every law enforcement agency in Tennessee 's out looking for him . They won 't find him . People think the devil has horns and a tail . They 're not used to looking for some kindly man who tells you what you want to hear . He 's just a man , Mulder ... - Just like O 'Connor . - Not like O 'Connor . If this was some kind of test , looks like I failed . I 'd say if it was , you passed with flying colors . - You 're alive , aren 't you ? - Proud and fancy free . Reverend Wells , it 's a real joy to have a man in the pulpit ... who has such an open and modern way of looking at God . Bless you for saying so . Well , I won 't keep you . I just wanted to welcome you to Hamden . Thank you . I look forward to seeing you on Sunday . Thank you .

 Previously on ' The 4400 ' . We 're not sure what 's happened . There 's something out there . The light has gone and thousands of people have appeared . Diana Skouris , Tom Baldwin . You will be one of the teams investigating what happened to the returnees . - We 're letting them go . - Letting them go ? We don 't have a right to hold them . Why disappear a little girl , hold her for 60 years and send her back , able to predict the future ? - What were they thinking ? - Is there a ' they ' ? Whoever sent them planned for these changes to take place . You 're talking about a ripple effect ? I wasn 't pregnant when I was abducted , but I was when I got back . You haven 't told your counsellor , have you ? My foundation has an opening in the security department . - If you 're interested , come and see me . - I 'll be there . Despite nationwide protests , Homeland Security refuses to divulge the names or whereabouts of the 4400 living in the United States . You don 't do journalism , You 're getting in the way . What are you going to do ? Disappear me ? - About last night ... - The kiss . And other things . We 've got a lot to talk about . I was reviewing Kyle 's EEG read-out and it seems last Thursday he had a momentary burst of increased brain activity . Shawn , did you do something to him ? Talk to me . - How long have I been in the dark ? - Kyle ? The results are inconclusive but we must be missing something . People don 't regain consciousness after a three year coma for no reason . We don 't care why this happened . Right , Tom ? We 're just glad to have Kyle back . You 've been prodding him for a week . When can we take him home ? - I don 't see why not now . - That 's wonderful . But there is something else . Patients like Kyle often have difficulty adjusting to their awakenings . They do best in environments similar to those they were in before their comas . In every detail . Places , the people ... All right , come on . - Why are we here ? - We thought you 'd be happier at home . - Then , why take me here ? - Kyle , this is your home . This is your room , Kyle . It 's just the way you left it . OK . Whoa , whoa , whoa . I got you . I got you . This isn 't my room . And this isn 't my house . - Kyle . - Kyle . What are looking for , buddy ? What are you looking for ? - We can help . - Kyle , Kyle , talk to us . - What is he doing ? - I say we just let him work it out . But he hasn 't recognised his room . Linda , the doctor told us he 'd be disoriented . I 'm glad you 're moving back in . I 'll try to stay out of your way as much as I can . Come on , Jordan , aren 't you overreacting ? No , I 'm not at all . Publishing the names and addresses of the 4400 is a crime , Barbara . It 's a violation of the privacy of over 4,000 people . Whoever did it should be prosecuted . So , warning people they may be living next to a public menace is a crime ... - We don 't want any . - Shawn , it 's your uncle . Let me in . - Uncle Tommy . - Hey , Shawn . - Come to take the tour ? - Quite a procession out there . Yep . They started driving by the house the day my name showed up on the Net . They haven 't stopped since . Yey for us ! Well , I know this is hard for you , Shawn . I just stopped by to say thank you . We took Kyle home yesterday and ... I 'm grateful . - He 's doing good , right ? - Yeah . He 's got a lot of work to do but he 's awake . Aunt Linda , does she know ? - About what I did , I mean ? - No , I figured you wouldn 't want that . Truth is , Uncle Tommy ... I don 't know what happened . I put my hands on him . That 's it . He woke up . - He woke up and I don 't know why . - You see , Shawn . This thing that you can do . Whatever it is , we need to learn more . Well how ? How ? I could go into quarantine again . They could study me some more . No ! I 'm done with all that . With the hypnosis and the dream journals and the counselling . I hear you . But I can be an ally . Maybe I can help you . I don 't think so , Uncle Tommy . That was some movie . Biggest screen I ever saw . And the sound and all those , er ... - Special effects . - Yes . - So , did you like it ? - Not really . But it sure did look good . - Something 's wrong . - Down ! - The genie is out of the bottle . - Three different bombings in one day . Each targeting the 4400s whose addresses were made public . Wait a second . - It 's a pipe bomb , tripwire trigger . - It 's about as basic as you can get . Amateur . Diana , I just found part of the casing . Mm-hm . It 's beautiful . Shawn 's name is on that list . I had my sister upgrade her security system , but ... Yeah , I 'm worried about Maia , too . Did you ever think about putting her back into quarantine ? Yeah , I 've thought about it . I 've even talked it over with her . She started crying . She wants to stay with me , Tom . I 'm glad it 's working out . Who would have thought ? How 's Kyle adjusting to being back home ? Still weak , his memory 's a mess but he 's out of that damn hospital . What does his doctor think ? He 's stunned , just like us . It 's a miracle . I don 't have any other way of putting it . What about Shawn ? What about him ? Where was he when Kyle woke up ? I have no idea . All three bombs so far were identical in design and composition . Pipe casings , tripwire triggers . I did a chemical analysis of the explosive . It 's homemade plastique , boiled down from bleach . The recipe 's on the internet . Just like the list of victims . I 'd like to get my hands on whoever leaked those names . Come on , Tom . Who do you think leaked them ? - Barbara Yates . - Goddamn right . It 's just her style . Cheap , inflammatory and dangerously irresponsible . I 'll handle Yates . You two back-trace hits on websites that published these bomb recipes . - We 'll have the results soon . - So will I. - You own this entire complex ? - 80 homes . Once we have this place off the ground , I 'm planning developments in Chicago and Los Angeles . I intend to provide a safe haven for any 4400 in this country who needs one . We 're opening sooner than I planned but the bombings make that necessary . You do think big , don 't you ? I 'm a business man . I 've been given a second chance to do something with my life , besides make money . Cos right now , that 's just not enough . Or maybe I 'm having a mid-life crisis . 93 Tomberra Lane , what do you think ? Oh , they 're beautiful . They 're all beautiful . Well , it 's yours . You 'll be our first official residents . Oh , we can 't afford a house right now . Consider it a gift for the two of you and your new baby . It 's a small world . You did it , didn 't you ? Kyle waking up ? That was you . You fixed him , just like you fixed my hand . - Have you told Danny ? - No , and I don 't want you to . But maybe if he knew what you did , he 'd stop thinking of you as ... A monster . I 've been doing some thinking . This thing between Danny and me . - Maybe it was a mistake . - I don 't want to hear this . It 's not your fault . I mean that . Danny 's sweet . I like him , but that 's all . He more than likes you . I know . - Dennis Ryland ? - Yeah . I 'm Warren Lyttel . I believe HomeSec in D.C. Mentioned I was coming . Oh yeah , they warned me . Well , they 're never happy . They seem to think you need to be more aggressive investigating the 4400 . I 'm here to nudge things along . " Authority to review all 4400 case files . " Access to all meetings and briefing sessions . " Permission to ride with field agents at your discretion . " - That 's a pretty broad mandate . - They 're looking at five murders . Three unsolved bombings . Barbara Yates bashing us all over the airwaves . Seems to them you could use help . I suppose it could look that way from a conference room in D.C. It looks that way from everywhere except this glass tower of yours . I have 1,000 returnees within 75 miles of Seattle . I 've got two dozen agents to ride herd on all of them . You wanna help me ? Get me some more personnel . You wanna help me ? Get D.C. Off my back . But you 're not really here to help me , are you ? No . - We 're here to clean up your mess . - Where did they recruit you from ? - FBI ? NSA ? - Doesn 't matter where I came from . How long have you been in public service ? 15 , 16 years ? And suddenly you got a shot at a command of your own . Well , you come and take it from me . If you can . Kyle , what 's going on ? - They 're lies . - What do you mean ? These pictures , I don 't belong in them . These people , I don 't know them . No , no , no . Of course , you do . Look . This is you at the zoo with Grandma Fran when you were eight . Remember ? And this is your birthday party when you turned ten . You remember George ? - He was my friend . - That 's right . That 's right . And Freddy , you have to remember Freddy . He was over here all the time when you were little . Remember ? - Bugs Bunny . - That 's right . - Exactly . He was crazy about cartoons . - Don 't touch me ! I 'm sorry . I 'm , I 'm ... trying to help . It 's not my memory . You 're my father . I recognise you , but I don 't know who you are . It 's like you 're a stranger . Kyle , Kyle . Kyle , just look at me . Just look at me . - I need help . - I want to help you . - Why can 't you help me ? - I 'm trying . I 'm trying . I 'm trying . The ripple effect . What about it ? Every time we stop by the theory room , you and Marco always talk about how every case we work on has a ripple effect . Every case but the Friday Harbor murders . What if these bombings are that ripple ? Knox went from killing prostitutes before his disappearance to killing random women once he came back . - What if they weren 't random ? - That 's interesting . We should look into Knox 's victims . See if we can find a connection there . I can 't condone these bombings , but I understand the fear behind them . The easiest way to stop the violence is to put the 4400 out of harm 's way . Someplace safe for them and for us . Now , I know to some of you that that may sound harsh , heartless even . And I assure you , I don 't mean it to be . Just as I assure you that there are those among the 4400 who ... Truck 's ready to go . I won 't be happy till we torch them all . They can all burn in hell . - Hey , I was listening to that . - I 'm sick of listening to it . - She 's on our side . - That woman is a parasite . She doesn 't give a damn about us or that our sister was murdered by one of those 4400 bastards . OK ? Why don 't you unload the fertiliser , eh ? Leave the air filter on . Those damn fumes are killing me . Kyle ! Kyle ! Hey ! Hey ! It 's good to see you , man . What are you doing sitting out here in the rain ? What are you staring at ? Listen , you 're looking pretty good . The way your folks were talking I thought you 'd be some kind of zombie . They won 't leave me alone . Asking me questions , staring at me all the time . They 're just glad to have you back . My mom did the same thing to me . My parents had you come here , didn 't they ? To try to make me remember . - No , Kyle . Hey ! - I 'm going inside . - I 've got reading to do . - You 've got reading to do ! Kyle ! Come on ! I just got here . Look at you ! I could have bought a car in my day for the price of this suit . - How 's it going ? - We 've got a lot of work to do . Five families moved in today . Seven more by the end of the week . Got half a mile of property line to shore up . The fences are too short . - Overhanging trees along the perimeter . - Along the perimeter ? Well , as long as you 're on the job , I feel safe and so does the baby . Two happy residents . That 's a start . It has been a crazy day . No , my assistant 's out . My phone sheet is a mile long . I never got to the end of it . Anyway ... Miss Yates , Dennis Ryland would like to speak with you . Dennis . What a pleasant surprise ! Well , this is a bit theatrical , don 't you think ? - Read this . - What is it ? - It 's a story . A good one . - About the 4400 ? No , about a TV talking head that was involved in a car accident last year . A hit and run , actually . It was really ugly . The pedestrian she hit died instantly . It was a shame . He was 40 years old , father of three . No wonder she spent so much money covering it up . So ... Are you blackmailing me , Dennis ? I shut up about the 4400 and this envelope goes in a vault somewhere ? Not good enough , Barbara . - What do you want me to do ? - It 's too late for you to do anything . I gave you a chance and you refused . Steve Smizick from the D.A. ' s office wants to talk to you . He 's going to charge you with vehicular manslaughter , among other things . Look , face it . Shutting me up is not going to make the 4400 disappear from the headlines . And eventually , they will cost you your job . We 'll see . Goodbye , Barbara . Is this wisest move under the circumstances , Mr Collier ? All these 4400s in the same place is a target . There are always dangers . That 's why I hired the security team . Mr Tyler , I know you 're trying to protect your family , but you must realise that by staying here , you could be in serious danger . Maybe . But you know I was born in 1922 , in Missouri . And my skin was as black , then , as it is now . So , I 've had to worry about fire bombings and beatings my entire life . And if there 's anything I learned , it 's this . Eventually a man 's got to take a stand . I 'm making mine right here . ... a sprained ankle . - To the other side . - Maia , how did you do today ? - Miss Skouris , can we talk ? Well , give us a sec . Can you ? Sorry I 'm late again . Please understand ... I 'm afraid you can 't bring Maia back to school anymore . We have to consider the safety of the other students . - Has Maia been a problem ? - Not at all . She 's lovely . But it 's the bombings . With Maia 's name on that list we can 't risk having her here at school . I 'm sorry . I understand . I 'm sorry , Maia . We 'll find someplace else , I promise . - It 'll be OK . - No , it 's not OK . It 's wrong . No , I mean , someone 's coming who will make everything better . We just have to wait a little longer . Oh , you got too warm . Come on . Let 's look pretty . Don 't you want to look pretty ? That 's better . - Is that a blasting cap ? - It 's a commercial detonator . It 'll be easier to trace than a bottle of bleach . We 'll send it to the lab . It needs serial numbers . Or a purchaser would be nice . What do you have on the victim ? Mary Denneville . 27-years-old . The flower shop was her father 's . She disappeared in 1999 but picked up her life right where she left off . Until today . Are the 4400 that frightening to people ? Are we too close , so we don 't see it ? Something like this isn 't fear . This is hate , pure and simple . Baldwin . Right now ! - What ? - We have to go in . Nikki . Shawn . - There 's something I need to tell you . - I know . - I saw you and Danny talking yesterday . - I just ... want to make one thing clear . Me breaking up with Danny has nothing to do with you . OK ? OK . Do you ever feel like you just wanted to get away from your life for a while ? I did that for three years . I don 't recommend it . - You know what I mean . - Yeah . Find a quiet place where you can pretend that ... things are simple . That nobody 's angry at you , or hurt or sad . I know just the spot . Come on . I 'll take you . Yeah ? - Yeah . - OK . I 've been studying your case files . You 're the first investigative team I 've talked to , but it seems like you 're the right place to begin . Where shall we start , Orson Bailey , Oliver Knox ? How about Maia Rutledge ? Age eight . Disappeared in ' 46 . What about her ? It says here her foster parents returned her to quarantine , no reason given . Then there 's all these reports of her making predictions that come true . Next thing , she 's been removed from quarantine by one of our field agents . I believe it goes on to say , " For further study " . But you haven 't filed any other reports though , have you ? All of this was approved by Ryland . I don 't see what the problem is . Next case , Shawn Farrell , aged 17 . Disappeared in April of 2001 . It 's a little thin . Isn 't it , Tom ? Why don 't you accuse us of whatever it is and let us get back to work . You two are good field agents . But it was a mistake to let two people with such obvious conflicts of interest to remain on the 4400 investigation . This is not a conflict of interest , it is a window into these people 's lives . You have a gang task force , you want people on it who know gangs . We know the 4400 better than anyone . That 's why we 're on this case . - Nice spin . Is this what Ryland thinks ? - Is that all your after ? Ryland ? You know it 's ironic . The North-West Division used to be a backwater . It was given to Ryland like a pat on the back for a career of good service . A quiet place where he could ride out his last years before retirement . But his free ride ended the night the 4400 showed up by that lake . Now there 's going to be a change around here , whether you like it or not . You can either be part of it or you can get swept aside . - Lily Moore to see you . - Uh , send her in . - Lily , what can I do for you ? - Um ... Yeah , Chilean sea bass ? Tenderloin medallions ? Lobster sushi ? Jordan , I just asked if I could use the common area for our support group , I didn 't mean for you to cater it like a black tie dinner . People want to eat whether they 're wearing tuxedos or not . It 's going to be a really emotional night . These people are like me . Their family reunions didn 't turn out as planned . It 's all paid for . Anyone ever tell you you 're a control freak ? Once or twice . Or that throwing money at people might make them question what you want in return ? That sounds awfully serious . If I 've made you uncomfortable ... It 's just ... you go so far out of your way to make sure I 'm taken care of . You give me for than I 've thought about , or asked for or needed . You know I 'm in love with Richard , right ? Lily Moore , you are a blunt woman and I find that attractive , which I know was not your intent . Look , why would I try to break up you and Richard ? One , I 'm smart enough to know I 'd fail . Two , I just would never do that . Lily , thanks for coming by and I hope your support group enjoys the lobster . The William Wayne Construction Company bought the blasting caps . OK . Check their employee list with the names from the Knox case . I 'm already onto it . - I 'll call you back if I find your ripple . - Thanks . - How is he ? - You better see for yourself . What are you doing , buddy ? I 'm looking . - For what ? - For me . - This is the spot ? - Yep . Me and 4,399 of my closest friends popped out of a ball of light right here . It 's so pretty . I wonder why they sent you back here ? Why not on the White House lawn ? Or in the middle of Times Square ? I dunno , maybe they just appreciate a good view . - You think ? - I have no idea . - You 're such a jerk . - You 're just figuring that out now ? - Hey , let me see this . - What are you doing ? Doctor 's follow-up . Just ... It looks good . I keep thinking you 're still fourteen . I 'm not . I know . Tom ? I 've found something . What do you got ? Gone . - We 've got fertiliser . - And tyre tracks . They 've got a truck bomb . The tyre prints matched the phone company 's service trucks . So , we pulled their personnel records and found one Dean Keating . As in Gail Keating - Friday Harbor murder victim ? - Dean 's her older brother . - Not only that . Gail 's younger brother , Glenn works construction and on his last job the company was short two dozen blasting caps . So , a returnee kills their sister and they get revenge . And the 4400 go from being a threat to being sympathetic victims . Your ripple effect . All right , put out an APB on Keating 's truck , and don 't let it get to where it 's going . Come on . Where are you ? Mr Tyler , we 're looking for a truck bomb . Be on high alert . Understood . Thanks . We 're running out of time . There ! Truck number 85 . That vehicle 's assigned to Dean Keating . And it 's heading north on ... Aurora . Heading into Richmond Highlands . We need a list of all the 4400s in Richmond Highlands . There 's only one 4400 in that area . It 's Tom 's nephew . Tom , hold up ! Operations . Patch me through to that phone number again . Farrell residence . We 're not in . You know the drill . Susan , Shawn , Danny . If you can here this , get out of the house ! Is anyone there ? There it is . Number 85 . Get us down . Now ! Put your hands where I can see them ! Out of the truck . Keep your hands where we can see them . - What the hell ... - Shut up ! Stay down . - You 're not Keating . Where is he ? - He didn 't come in . No explosives . The truck 's clean , Tom . They switched vans . It 's not Keating . Come on ! Let 's go . We got the wrong van . Re-check all principle targets . Report anything suspicious . We 've got a 12ft step van parked near Collier 's housing complex . No plates , new paint job . That 's what the phone company uses . Patch us through to Collier 's . - Use any line you can find . - The phones are dead . Code Red . Main gate . There they are . Get me over there . Go ! I 've set it . Go ! Hands over your head ! Down ! Down ! Down ! Down ! On your stomach now ! You are being arrested as a terrorist . You will be treated as an enemy combatant . You do not have the right to an attorney . Whatever you say will damn sure be used against you ! Doctor MacMillan to ... Doctor Mayhew . I 'm Warren Lyttel from Homeland Security . I need to ask a few questions about Kyle Baldwin . - Tom , you have to come quick ! - What ? Just come ! Kyle ! What are you doing ? I know what 's wrong with me . - I finally understand . - What is it , Kyle ? Tell me ! There 's only one explanation . Why I remember everything , but can 't feel anything . Why all the people in my life seem like strangers . They 're not strangers . I am . I 'm not Kyle Baldwin .

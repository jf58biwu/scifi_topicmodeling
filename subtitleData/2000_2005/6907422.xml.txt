I 'm telling you the truth when I 'm saying she 's happy . We were invited last night , too . Well , I leave it in your hands . She is ? She 's making that face because she 's being stubborn , but she 's actually really happy . Her house is really strict , and they 're always on her about her missions and her duties . She 's never been on a trip . Although this is also considered a mission . Hey ! Is there anything you guys want ? No naughty books ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Why did Shun have to be like that ? Thanks to him , I can 't look like I 'm enjoying anything . Jeez ... Hey , can I sit here ? Well ! Aren 't you glad it 's such a nice day ? Where are you going ?

He hasn 't been on Earth for that long , so he doesn 't know what he 's up against . Oh , he shouldn 't have ... Excuse me , who is Tsuchii ? Oh he 's a Tsuifofian .

Okay ! From here on , we walk ! How far is it ? Let 's see ... Depends on how you look at it , I guess . Are you all right ? Yeah . Everyone 's in such good shape . I work out , so ... Do you run , or something ? It 's my morning chores . There 's a spring on a hill , on the other side of the mountain behind my family 's shrine . I fill a bucket full of that spring water and bring it back . Yeesh . You 've got to be kidding me ! Do you ... know where we 're going ? I don 't , but this path is ... What 's wrong ? It 's similar ... to the mountain path that 's behind my family 's shrine . Tenmo Mountain ? But , we 're in the Nagao mountain range . In the Chubu region . The path I take for my morning chores is just like this ... I was so exhausted , but I was running as fast as I could ! It 's kind of lame to be running behind a girl , but being lost would be even worse ! Run ! Run ! And they cross the finish line ! Good job ! Good job ! Where are we ? Welcome ! To the Village of Falling Stars . Here we are . I 'm home ! Huh ? Huh ? Isn 't this ... Oh , welcome ! Everyone ! Let me introduce you . This is my grandpa , Asougi Subaru ! Pleased to meet you !

Yes , I 've lost them . They were all together at the foot of the mountain , but ... One person disappeared , then two ... This is no time to tell ghost stories , you idiot ! It 's not on the map , and it won 't show up on satellite ! But it definitely exists ! It 's our homeland ! It 's where the people of Tenmo came from ! Do whatever it takes to locate it ! All right ? It 's useless . A human won 't be able to find the Village of Falling Stars . Relax . I 'm not your enemy . You 're ... not an enemy ? If you want , I 'll lend you a hand .

Leave it to us ! Off we go ! Yeah ! Where are we going to go fishing ? I know a good spot . Huh ? M ... Muryou . It 's the same as when we came here . There 's a little trick to entering and leaving this village . You say it 's the same , but I don 't remember . Don 't worry . Don 't worry . See ? Huh ? Huh ? Alright . We have lots of time , but let 's get started . This place is so mysterious . A pathless road leads to somewhere , and the somewhere leads to a road . This place is like a puzzle . That 's because this is the place you guys refer to as " The Mountain " . It 's Japan , but it 's not . It 's a place that 's on Earth , but it 's not or something . I know what your power is . Oh ? What kind of power is that ? A match ... maybe ? You 've only been here a day and you noticed it . You 're very bright . Um ... Is this place ... Come . Let 's start , shall we ? Sure ... At the rate you 're going , we 'll be able to finish today 's workload for sure . Why ? Why weren 't we invited to The Mountain ? What are they doing there ? Can this be allowed ? How can this be allowed ? I ... Hey ! Hurry up and get over here ! Wait for me ! Oh , this is totally so much fun ! Hey ! Hurry up and get over here ! Wait for me ! Oh , this is totally so much fun !

This is just perfect ! Cheers ! Okay , everyone ! Drinks are on me today so keep those glasses filled ! Cheers to the Seagull House ! Cheers ! Thanks guys ! Seagull House Seagull House By the way , about Tsuchii ... By the way , about Tsuchii ... Is he back yet ? He only left yesterday . I bet he feels like he can 't give up too soon . When I did it , I gave up in an hour . Kon , in your case , you gave up way too soon ! What 's your captain doing these days ? Captain is concentrating on collecting information on Earth . That 's right ! I 'm the goofball , Hayabusa ! This is stupid . All right ... Are you leaving ? Don 't you feel bad for him ? I 'm going before he gets himself hurt . Yeah ! Defender of Justice ! Yeah ! Defender of Justice ! What are you doing ? Sir , I 'm attempting to infiltrate with the help of a co-conspirator . A co-conspirator ? Who is that ? He 's identified himself as a Tsuifofian , an alien . Currently , he 's using his super advanced technological device to analyze and decipher a way to get in . This area is protected by a special force-field . It shifts time and space to avoid entry by anyone other than a selected few . No one can see it , and with Earth 's current level of military satellites humans won 't be able to solve this mystery . Huh ? Hey ! What 's happening ? Y ... Yes ! The Tsuifofian has conjured something amazing out of his right hand . What is it ? What 's the amazing thing ? I 'll cancel the force-field with the energy from this Tsuifof Cannon ! I 'll expose this secret base yet ! Hey wait ! I 'm in your line of fire ! Hey what 's happening ? Shoot ! What are you doing ? Sir , I 'm attempting to infiltrate with the help of a co-conspirator . A co-conspirator ? Who is that ? This area is protected by a special force-field . It shifts time and space to avoid entry by anyone other than a selected few . No one can see it , and with Earth 's current level of military satellites humans won 't be able to solve this mystery . Huh ? Hey ! What 's happening ?

What 's happ ... Wh ... Wh ... Wh ... W-W-W-W-W ... How did I know ? What 's happening ? What 's happ ... Wh ... Wh ... Wh ... W-W-W-W-W ... Pub Aren 't you glad that our man , Jiltosh , brought you back here ? I 'm sorry for causing such an inconvenience . Everyone ! Today Tsuchii , I mean this Tsuifofian here , will be picking up the tab instead ! So don 't hold back and drink up ! Yeah ! So don 't hold back and drink up ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Here you go . Thank you . We 're like tourists on this planet . There are things that are good to know and things we 're better off not knowing . It 's best for us to sit back and enjoy . For now ... For now ? You idiot ! What have you been doing this entire time ? Well ... Umm ... When I realized , um ... It 's dark and I 'm scared . I don 't care ! He must have been really tired . Sis , I think you wore him out . You think so ? Hey , where 's Nayuta ? Kitchen . Hajime too ? Are you jealous ? A little jealous . To tell you the truth , I am too ! Grandpa went for a walk . Jeez . He sure likes to do that . The fish served at dinner was really good . Muryou caught all of them . I failed miserably . Really ? Well it doesn 't matter . It was really good . Thanks . You 're creeping me out . I 'm in a good mood . I feel like I got an inkling of the meaning behind this . Meaning of what ? That 's a secret . Darn . Are you all right ? I 'm fine . I 'm fine . You go ahead and go home . Maybe I should take the long way home . Let 's see ... Are you peeping again ? What are we going to do with you ? Well , umm ... There was another guy who tried to break in again so I was worried about everyone . Everyone , eh ? It 's fine . As long as you or I don 't try anything funny that village will be fine . You can 't get to the secret village by following the road . You can see it from space , but not by using machines . Only with the naked eye are you able to see it . And only from here . Don 't worry . My lips are sealed , no matter what . It 's a promise I made with you , Setsuna and him . A stay in Muryou 's hometown . Lots of things happened , and I had a lot of fun . This sounds like something from my little sister 's picture diary , but oh well ... This mini-trip is about to end , but summer vacation still goes on . To be continued in the next episode . To be continued Next Episode I 'm Jiltosh the Velunnian . The Zaiglians have decided that they 'll be leaving Earth , so there 's going to be a going away party for them !

 See this ? It 's what I use to monitor Jake and track his vitals and stuff like that . It 's technology at its best . - Jake ! - Sarah ! - Who 's the girl ? - Oh , it 's Sarah . Georgetown Sarah ? Lived in the same dorm for four years and never asked her out - Sarah ? That 's the one . See how the nanites have positioned themselves along his central nervous system ? What they 're doing is establishing contact with the brain . The lab mice experienced muscle spasms . In rare cases , they rejected the nanites and the result 's not good . What is going to happen to me ? I received your message . I will meet you at the restaurant . Hmm . Buon giyrno , Lorenzo . Come sta ? Bene ? Ciao , Maria . Antonio ... piccolo Antonio bebe laco Antonio ? Antonio ? Oh , my god . Jake . Come on . Come on , Jake . Oh ! Jake ! Wh ... are you okay ? Yes , I 'm fine . What are you doing here ? Well , I was worried about you . I checked your vitals , and they-they showed ... Oh , no . What ? Um ... my screen is frozen . I 'm sorry . Oh , my god . That 's me . Jake Foley , I 'm in Tech Support . Security Clearance : Low . Very low . Then one day , it all changed . Life just got real interesting . Fran , we need to run another diagnostic screen . We 've just run one . Yeah . Well , his vitals are fading fast , so we need to run another one . Okay , okay , the screen , I know . It was my fault , but there was more to the story . - I certainly hope so . - Yeah . See that mouse ? That 's Antonio , who , unfortunately , remains in the same state in which I found him this morning - that is , paralyzed . Can I show you something ? This particular side effect has occurred on rare occasions in beta versions of the nanites , but never before in this latest version . - Is that what 's in ... - Antonio . Yes . It 's also what 's in Jake . - In fact , they 're twins . - Twins ? Yeah . They were injected on the same day , which is why ... why I 'm concerned . Is Jake showing any symptoms ? - Well ... no , but ... - Dr. Hughes , because if he is , I ... I need to know about it . - Okay . - I 'm quite serious . I can 't afford to have Jake being a risk out in the field . Do you understand ? Yes . Of course . Good . Keep your eye on him . Well , that 's not going to be easy . - Departure time ? - 9 : 00 A.M. - What 's the flight number ? - Flight 10-11 . Hmm , that sounds really familiar . Sarah , you 're not going to believe this . - We are on the exact same flight . - Great . Mm-hmm . Hey , are you staying at that inn what 's that place called ? - No . I 'm staying at the Bay Lodge . Yeah . I thought the lodge looked better , too . We can share a car . Sure . Sure we can share a car . That 's a great idea . - Okay . Friday at 10 : 00 . - See ya . Jake . Yes ? - Could I have a word ? - Sure . Ow ! How could this come as a surprise ? I put my request in to Human Resources three weeks ago . Well , unbeknownst to Human Resources , you have a half billion dollars worth of research inside of you . Research that many people would like to get their hands on . It 's a wedding . - You 're still at risk . - From what , drunken bridesmaids ? Lou , I woke up this morning with guns in my face . What 's next , sidearm chaperones on dates ? Permission to go potty ? It 's for your own protection , Jake . And I appreciate that , but I need to have a life outside of this . My friend is getting married . I 'm his best man . Please . All I 'm asking for here is two days . Two days of a normal life . Sarah , hey . Glad this worked out . I , uh ... you know , it 's great about Kevin and Jen . I like you . Hey , Sarah , hey . Glad this worked out with the car and the whole flight . Maybe we could go out sometime and cut the rug ... it 's funny how , you know , they 've been friends for so long , and we 've been friends for so long - not that we should get married . I 'm not saying that . Definitely not saying that . Sorry I 'm late . Hey ! I just got caught up , and ... anyway . Don 't worry about it - I 'm just glad this whole thing worked out . So , pretty great about Kevin and Jen . Been friends for so long , getting married . It 's amazing . Yeah . I knew eventually they 'd figure it out . - Yeah . - Okay , so we got to go . Oh . Okay . Um , listen ... - We have all day to talk . - Yeah . - Hi . - Oh , uh , Jake , Alex . Alex , Jake . - Nice to meet you . - Yeah . You , too . Um , let me sit in the middle . Oh , you guys , this weekend 's going to be so much fun . - Yeah , it 's going to be great . - Okay . Dude ... Hey , man , how 's it going ? What 's up , Kev ? Yeah ! Whoa ! Can 't believe you 're still wearing the same old ratty jacket . Yeah , yeah . I can 't believe you 're still losing your hair . Hey ! Let 's not hit a guy below the belt on his wedding . So ... finally happened . Yeah , a lot quicker than I expected , believe me . I thought for sure I was going to be the last one to go . No , no , apparently , that 's me . Speaking of which , am I the only single person here ? What happened ? I thought you were coming with Sarah . You know , that didn 't exactly work out as planned . Uh-huh . You still haven 't told her how you feel . - It 's all about timing . - Right , yeah , years and years of timing . Come on , buddy , step off the ledge . - I mean , look , it happened with Jenny . - You stalked her . Whatever . She said yes . Hey , oh , listen , um , just go grab yourself a drink , and , um , I 'll go find my bride . She 's dying to see you . Thanks for coming . - Okay , man . - Okay . See you tomorrow . Hey , Fran ? - Can you do me a favor ? - What ? If , uh , if we 're asked any questions about the mice or Jake ... just let me know first . - Yeah . - Thanks . Yep . Having fun . Aww , finally , a familiar face . Hey . I swear , I 've been meeting relatives I didn 't even know existed . - Jen , you look beautiful . - Thank you . You 're much too beautiful for this guy . Well , what can I say ? Geeks turn me on . - Yeah . Ha ! - Hmm . So , a lot of people are looking forward to that toast . - Oh , yeah , how is that coming , by the way ? - Uh , it 's , ... um , right in here . - You got nothing . - Not a word . Oh , Jake . Honey , Aunt Lois wants to see you . Oh , is she sober ? Uh , for the moment , so now 's a good time . - Okay . - Good luck . Hey , hey , who 's that guy over there ? Well , who are you talking about ? The guy walking away - he 's been looking at me . Oh , that 's probably my cousin Phil . He 's a really weird dude . Hey . He 's single . Ha . Ha-ha . Jerk . Oh , great . That 's me . Oh , hi . Um ... Oh , here , you want to , uh ... have a seat . - Thank you . - Sure . I 'm Jake Foley . - Nice to meet you , Jake Foley . - You , too are you bride or groom ? Bride - we work together . Ah . Groom - best man . So , I , uh , guess they ... meant for us to meet . Hey , baby . Honey ! I 'd like you to meet Jake . Jake , this is Rachel , my partner . - Did you see that one ? - Yeah . Isn 't that funny . With the beard . I don 't know what 's going on . What am I doing ? No , no , no . Alex , stop . That tickles . Oh , how about this ? Oh , that 's perfect . How about here ? Idiot . Idiot . All right , all right . Hello . Jake , hey , it 's Diane . What are you doing ? - Nothing . - Really ? I just noticed some nanite activity , so ... Diane , you 're monitoring me at a wedding . I 'm sorry , Jake . It 's my job . I know . I know , I know . I 'm sorry . - It 's just ... it 's just ... - What ? Nothing . It 's nothing . Jake ... I don 't know , I guess I 'm just frustrated , you know . I 'm here , all my friends are here and they 're all moving on with their lives . They 're all ... falling in love and they 're having families and it 's just so clear that I 'm going nowhere . Jake , listen , all these things that you 're feeling - they 're ... they 're very common . I mean , just about everybody experiences them at one time or another . I mean , in med school we even coined a term for it . Oh , yeah , what 's that ? Yeah , " single syndrome . " Is it fatal ? No . It 's just mildly depressing . In the meantime , just try and get some sleep , okay ? - Thanks , Diane . - Good night . Good night . Who is it ? Hi . Hey . You 're surprised . A little bit . Well , I checked with an expert on the whole single syndrome thing , and he said you should never go to a wedding without a date . So here I am . I mean , not as your date - just as a friend posing as your date . Diane , uh , you didn 't have to ... No , no , I know . I had all these frequent-flier miles and I kind of always wanted to see Seattle , so ... I can 't believe you flew all the way out here . Yeah . So you 're buying breakfast . Oh , so the whole bouquet thing - it 's like why don 't you just shine a spotlight down on all the single , desperate women whose entire fate lies in the hands of this bride just blindly throwing flowers over her head . And then you have me . I mean , at my height , do you think I even stand a chance ? - Thanks . - Thanks . I don 't think I can eat this . What ? Why not ? My stomach 's all in knots . - Really , since when ? - I don 't know . Uh , a couple days ago . - Okay , well , is it ... is it ? - Put it away ! - Jake , this could be serious . - It 's not serious . It 's the wedding toast , okay ? This happens every time I have to speak in public . Sorry . Can I help at all ? No , no , I 'm beyond help . It 's like watching a train wreck . It 's okay . Everyone expects a disaster , and I deliver every time . Jake . Dude , paint ball . - Oh , yeah , yeah . - Paint ball ? Yeah , it 's kind of a tradition . You know , the whole battle before the battle type of thing . You okay ? Yeah , yeah , I 'm fine . - Okay , I 'll see you later . - Okay . - Let 's go . - C 'mon . David . Redner . Jesse . Meeks . Uh ... Shefflin . Spider . Later , Foley . Okay , guys , listen up . This may very well be the last time I get to see all of you guys ... without permission . But , and despite of the fact that we are all about to go to war , let 's not forget we came here to have some fun , okay ? So remember , safety first , guys . Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! That doesn 't count , does it ? That 's my best man . Okay , guys , let 's do it . Oh , Fran . It 's Diane . Anything on Antonio ? Not yet . I 'm still reviewing the backup data . - Okay , so you 'll let me know ? - Yeah . So , how 's Jake ? Oh , he 's fine . I feel kind of silly . Well , it 's better that you went anyway . Yeah . So listen , call me when you 're done , okay ? All right . Honey . We 're right over here . - They already started . - Okay , started what ? - Oh , no thank you , but this really - Honey ... This is so not my thing . Looking glamorous is every woman 's thing . Oh , thank you . Ooh . Okay . You 're a dead man , Foley ! - Who 've you got ? - It 's just Foley . This is going to be easy . Okay , you flank right . I 'll go left . He 'll have nowhere to run . On three , ready ? One ... two ... three . Well , that was easy . Damn . Mani-pedi 's one of life 's greatest pleasures . I 'm a virgin . Well , I 'm a mani-pedi virgin . It 's my first time . - You 're kidding ? - No . I always thought they were like a big waste of time . And now I see that that 's the point . Oh , exactly . I 'm Sarah Carter . Oh ... Oh , hi . Oh , I 'm so sorry ! I 'm Diane Hughes . I 'm really sorry . - Don 't worry about it . Don 't worry . - Oh , god . So are you with the bride or the groom ? Oh , the groom ... I guess . Although I haven 't actually met him . I 'm with Jake . - Jake Foley ? - Yeah . - We went to college together . - Yeah , I know . He 's mentioned you to me before ... once . Just once . Oh , uh ... that 's so weird , ' cause we rode to the airport together and he never mentioned bringing a date . Well , I 'm not actually his date . I 'm his doctor . Well , I 'm a doctor . I 'm a doctor . So it was a last minute thing . I guess so . So how 'd you meet ? Just at work . So you 're a doctor at the NSA ? Mm-hmm . Yes , Research . That must be really interesting . Yeah . What kind of research do you do ? Oh , I 'm in ... I am not allowed to tell you . It 's a ... confidentiality thing . - Right . - Sarah ! Um ... oh , Valerie 's open . - It 's nice to meet you . - Yeah . - I 'll see you later . - Okay . Hey , Jake . All right , all right , you got me . Hey , fella ... I think you 've got to turn down your pressure a little bit . What 's the matter , Jake , you afraid ? Seriously , man , you 're going to hurt somebody . Exactly . Jake , where you going ? Hey , Jake , come back . I just want to talk . Hey , Jake , wait up , Jake . Fantastic . Absolutely beautiful . You 've outdone yourself . Hi . I 'm all yours . Okay . Aw , Jake , where you been ? I 've got this little thing today - it 's called a wedding . Your cousin Phil is out of his freakin ' mind . - Yeah , so ? - Seriously . - He was trying to hurt me out there . - With paint balls ? Yeah . - Paint balls ? - Yes . Yes . - My cousin , Phil ? - Yeah ... - That 's Phil ? - Yeah . Hey . I 'm Jake . You think maybe you were a little aggressive out there ? Yeah , there 's nothing like a good hunt , huh ? Yeah . Fun , fun , maybe for you . I had you until that jump . Where 'd you learn how to do that ? Uh ... well , it was a lot lower than it looked . Yeah , I guess it was . Hey , I didn 't catch your name . See you at the wedding . - Paul , where 's Jake ? - I don 't know . Oh , man . Well , unbeknownst to human resources you have a half billion dollars worth of research inside of you . Research that a lot of people would like to get their hands on . There 's nothing like a good hunt , huh ? You are still at risk . It 's for your own safety . Secure line to Deputy Director Louise Beckett . What ? Uh , oh , yeah . Uh , Alpha Charlie Tango 4271 . No , no , no , listen , this is an emergen ... hello ? Hi . Have you noticed all the activity outside ? That 's my daughter 's wedding beginning . Yeah , I 'm sorry . I 'll be right there . I need you to call the police . May I ask why ? Yeah . ' Cause there 's a guy in room 214 who 's trying to kill me , that 's why . That was 214 ? Yes . Yes . Room 214 . Dude ... Jake ... what is your deal , man ? Everyone in there is waiting on you . I 'm sorry . Just give me one second . Jake , dude , you 're my best man , okay ? I 'm kind of freaking out here . I really need you . He needs you . Okay ? You 're right . You 're right , let 's go . Call them now . - I think she 's up ahead on the right . - What ? Diane , your date . We met . Oh , great . She seems really , um ... interesting . Yeah . Yes , she is . You keep a good secret , Jake . What ? I looked across the room and I thought to myself , " that girl is totally out of my reach . " Jenny , being with you has taught me how to love and be loved . Makes realize nothing is beyond my reach . Jake ... Jake ... ring . Oh . Yeah . Sorry . Here you go . Jenny ... I love you . Oh , man . That was beautiful . Fran ! Deputy Director Beckett called . She 's checking up on Jake . What do I say ? Fran , don 't tell her where I am . Tell her I 'll call her back . May this beautiful day shine eternally in your lives . May it add brilliance to every achievement and cast a divine light over any misfortune . Yeah , come on , come on , come on . And ... may all that is virtuous , beautiful and honest remain in your lives . Ladies and gentlemen , it is my honor to introduce you to ... Kevin and Jenny , husband and wife . You may kiss the bride . It starts with the muscles . First you think it 's just tension . What are you talking about ? Poison . It 's in your water bottle . You were very thirsty . Spreads to the eyes and the ears ... and soon there 'll be nothing left . Not even the nanites can help you . It 's not worth the fight , Jake . You 're already dead . Fran , it 's Diane . Do you have anything on Antonio ? Yeah , there was an abnormal increase in nanite activity around the interior cortex . But this is where it gets weird . On his brain , Antonio had a massive cluster of nanites in his frontal lobe . Oh , no . No . What happened ? Where is he ? Where 's Jake ? - You know Jake Foley ? - Yes . What happened ? Well , that 's what we 're trying to find out . Mr. Foley was seen on security camera breaking into one of the rooms . - What ? Why ? - We have no idea . Jake . Diane , get out of here . He 's after me . Jake , no one is after you . - No , he 's trying to kill me . - Jake ... Jake , listen to me . It 's the nanites . The nanites are killing you . What ? Okay , okay go and lay down , okay ? Okay ? Oh ... lay down . Okay , don 't worry , Jake . We 're going to figure this out , okay ? - Diane . Diane . - What ? - Diane . - What ? Diane ... he 's here . He 's in the room . Jake , Jake , listen to me . What you are seeing is not real . Diane , he 's right behind you . No . No , this is all in your mind . The nanites are rejecting you . They are overloading your brain with electrical impulses and making you see things that are not there . Jake , look , I need you to see this . That 's got to be uncomfortable . Okay , up . I got this from hotel security . It 's from earlier today . Who are you talking to ? - He was there . - No . No . I know it doesn 't make sense to you right now , but you have to trust me . In his room , the pictures of me . The room was empty . This is all in your mind . There has to be something in the kernel . Diane ... Maybe the code is self-replicating , - or there 's a memory link . - Diane ... Diane , I can 't move . Jake , it 's in here . The answer is in here somewhere and I will find it . There 's no more time . - You got to reboot . - No , we can 't do that . - Why not ? - Because the nanites are fully integrated into your system . They are part of you . If I shut them down , it will kill you . Maybe just for a second . No . No . We don 't know that . There 's got to be another way . Jake , no , I will not be the one to kill you . Please ... Okay . Okay , okay , I 'm setting up the command structure . The link is set . She can 't save you , Jake . Okay . You are okay . You are okay . Are you ready ? Okay . Jake ! One , two , three . Come on , Jake . One , two ... One ... come on ! Two , three . Come on ! Jake ! Jake ! Jake ? I 'm sorry . Jake ! Hey ! Who are you ? What ? I 'm just kidding . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . No , no ! Diane , Diane , I 'm the best man . Please ? I have a toast to give . I 'm okay . I 'm okay . Okay . Give me a second . Director Beckett , Hi . It 's Diane . You 're asking about Jake ? Yeah , have you heard from him ? Yeah , I spoke to him this morning and he 's fine . I overreacted as usual . All right . We 'll see you Monday . Okay , bye . Congratulations . Thanks , buddy . - Here we go . - Oh . I know you 've all been looking forward to this , so , uh , here goes . Life is , uh , hard , you know ? Brace yourself , folks . Thank you . Go on , Jake . Okay . Jenny , Kevin may need more professional help than most , but he 's a terrific guy , and he loves you more than anything . And , Kevin , science may never discover how it happened , but you won Jenny 's heart ; and , to me , that 's the real miracle here . We 're lucky if we 're able to find someone who 's always there for us , who stands by us no matter what . Makes life easier . So , to my friends , to our good friends , Kevin and Jenny . Thanks , buddy . Hey . Your toast was really beautiful . It seems like you got over your fear . Yeah . Yeah , I guess it was all in my head . So , where 's Alex ? Oh . I think he found somebody more his type . I don 't get it . Alex is gay ; he 's a friend . I just hate coming to these things alone . But I thought I heard ... I thought that Joe ... So you 're not ... ? Oh , no , no . No . The closest Alex gets to me is a facial . Oh . Well ... So , uh , I guess I 'm , I 'm dateless . Yeah . Um ... I think we 're supposed to dance now . Yeah . Sarah , I think I need to dance with my date . Would you like to dance ? Aren 't you supposed to ... ? Yes . I forgot to tell you something . What ? You look beautiful . Grazi .

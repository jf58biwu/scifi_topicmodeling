 Easy , old boy . I 'm not ready for the roasting pot just yet . You didn 't have any luck , either . Oh , I haven 't seeing a thing a little longer enough for shot . Oh , it 's very quiet . Still we can 't go back to the treehouse empty-handed . I 'd never live it down . You know this small stand the trees . Just down along the sore the inland sea ... it usually good , my be worthy a try . I defer to your expertise . I 'll try here , we rendezvous back in half and hour ? Right you are ! Well , well , well , what have we here ? This is one hell of a graveyard if I 've ever seen one . Best not to disturb it , dare I say . Challenger ? Perhaps something a little bigger . Just leaving my friend not looking for any trouble . Over there now . What the Devil ... How many are you ? Where did you go ? Oh boy . At the dawn of the last century A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out ... of the Lost World Mystery solved . That 's a little to close for comfort . only back for more , hey ? All right . Come on , Come on , you near-sighted tank ! All right back to where we started . And no harm done . Au revoir my friend . No , I 'm warning you . You are making me very angry . Last chance to run away ! Enough is enough . Oh I gave you a chance and you wouldn 't take it . You know , I have a good mind to mount ... that rack of yours on the tree house wall . Too bad you taste so bloody awful . Can move . Not a good feeling , is it ? Being helpless . I am Oseena Protector of this sacred ground . You have violated ... the sanctity of this hallowed place by killing ... one of these magnificent creatures without reason , robbing it of its final days . You are thinking that I am here to kill you ... to avenge the life that you have so needlessly taken . But you are wrong . You will not die . Not yet . Nor by my hand . There , you are cursed . But you will not die quickly . You will be hunted relentlessly . You will learn what it feels like ... to be unable to escape the brutal hunter . You will run and hide ... and plead for mercy , and find none . You will be degraded and humiliated , and in the end you will beg for death . Oh there you are . What was all the shooting about ? - What happened to you ? - I don 't know for sure . I stumbled into some sort of ... dinosaur graveyard and almost got killed by one very angry triceratops . Well , those brutes can be treacherous indeed . Nothing compared to the creature I just encountered . Oseena ! She said she was some ... kind of woman ... part animal . I was paralyzed , Challenger ! I ... couldn 't move at all . I couldn 't even speak . Some kind of guardian . Protector of the sacred arch , she said . Challenger , you , you 've got to believe me . I swear to you , she reached ... in to my chest , and she pulled out something ... I don 't know what it was , but it was dark and very evil ! And I saw it devour my weapons like some kind of animal ! How do you feel ? Empty in a way . I can 't explain . She said I was ... cursed for killing a dinosaur , and that I would be hunted , like an animal . Then she just vanished . So you 're being hunted by some predatory - thing that came out of your chest . Where is it now ? I don 't know . But it 's close ... I think . Very close . It 's going to be dark in half an hour . Let 's get back to the tree house . Here , you take this for protection . Hunting is over for the day . Roxton ! Do you see it ? No . But I can feel it . The last think I want to do is lead it back to the tree house ! Well , that 's what the electric fence is for . Do you really think an electric fence could stop a shadow ? Well , whatever it is , we 'll deal with it together . Come on . Marguerite and Veronica will be worried . Why does it seem you had better luck hunting when Malone was around ? We didn 't . When Malone was here , there was just one more of us to do the job , that 's all . Maybe it 's time you gave up meat altogether . We have lots of fruits and vegetables around here . Fine for monkeys and other distant cousins , but humans have been carnivores since we climbed down from the trees . Except humans have a choice I can 't find any reference to the name Oseena in your father 's journals . I don 't remember my parents ever mentioning her , or the graveyard Roxton found . Shifting planes of reality , another phenomenon of the plateau . Whatever the explanation . - This place was real . - Oh quite so . But it is odd that Veronica 's parents never encountered this animal guardian . Well , my parents are vegetarians . That explains a lot of things . I think when you 're feeling better , we should return to this place for a closer examination . the first thing tomorrow . She had some very nasty nails . Not nails , claws . She had scales on her face and body . - Sounds attractive . - No , not at all . But that predatory look in her eyes was somewhat familiar . Be careful , Lord Roxton . I have a pair of scissors in my hand ! Yes . It 's another beautiful day , Ned . I only wish you were here to share it with me . Roxton was right . Veronica ! Veronica ! - Where is she ? - She must be beyond the fence . Good gracious ! - Hang on , Veronica ! - Like I have a choice ! Marguerite . Here ! Give me a hand ! Careful . Are you hurt ? Not hurt . Just angry . Who did this ? You know , if you 'd been a couple of pounds heavier ... She 'd be shish-kabob ! It wasn 't meant for Veronica . - It was designed for me . - What do you mean ? If I had stepped into that snare , my weight would have brought me straight down onto those stakes . That 's true enough . You said this thing that 's hunting you is an amorphous mass . Do you think it is capable of creating something as sophisticated as this ? Apparently so . Who else could it be ? Maybe that woman you encountered in the graveyard . No ! More like whatever she pulled out of me . Whatever that was , maybe you 're better off without it . Come on . What do you think you 're doing ? - I 'm going after it . - Not on your own , you 're not . George , I will not let anyone else take responsibility for what I 've caused ! It could have happened to anyone of us . But it didn 't ! It happened to me ! We stick together on this , John . If it 's hunting you , it 's hunting all of us . There must be some way to lift this curse . If only we knew more about this guardian . What else do we need to know ? She said there was no escape that ... I 'll be hunted down and killed . But it 's shadow . No , Marguerite . It 's obviously much more than that . Roxton , do you recall anything specific about the location ... - ... because if you do ... - Look out ! Challenger ! The bullet went right through , but it 's hard to tell ... how much damage was been done . - I 'm all right . - Take it easy ! You 've lost a lot of blood . He won 't be the only one . I 'm going to track this thing down and kill it ! - Not on your own , you 're not . - You 're in no condition to move . You 're not walking out of here alone . What are you going to do ? You going to stop me ? Yes ! If I have to . - Get out of my way , Veronica . - I 'm going with you . Marguerite can stay here and watch Challenger . John ! Please ! If you get shot ... If I get shot ... what ? I won 't have anyone to antagonize . My life will be quite dull . I can promise you I won 't let that happen , Marguerite . But I brought this creature here , and I ... And we 'll get rid of it together ! That 's the way it 's always been . Veronica 's right . Divided we fall . We can all use a little help once in a while , John . Even you ! Very well . - Human footprints ! - You sound surprised . I told you what was following me . A shadow pulled from your chest . Whatever it was , it 's obviously human now . A triceratops is tough as leather . Why did you shoot it when you didn 't have to ? Oh believe me , Veronica , I gave it every chance to get away . It just wouldn 't have it . I really had no choice . It just doesn 't make any sense . This woman , the animal protector she must have seen what happened ! Well , if she did , she didn 't see it my way . Twice the damn thing tried to gore me . I run , I ducked , fired warning shots over its head . Ultimately , one tends to lose his temper ... Watch out ! That was a little too close for comfort ! Damn right . A very clever piece of work . He set this trap and doubled back on himself ... Exactly the kind of play I 'd use . Now which way did you go ? What 's he up to ? Back and forth circle round and round . Is he trying to lose us ? If he is he 's not doing a very good job . I think he 's playing a game . He 's the cat and I 'm suppose to be the mouse . Over there ! He 's coming this way . His first and last mistake . It 's you ! No bloody likely . Throw down your weapons ! Who are you ? Last chance ! Next one 's got your name on it ! Shoot him ! Roxton ! What are you trying to do ? Get yourself killed ? What kind of a thing is that ! Some ... dark form of you . I 've seen it pulled out of me . She gave it life . Oh he 's quick ! Just one mistake , that 's all I ask for . Look ! Can 't be far . How can it just disappear ? This 's really surprising , it must be around here somewhere . Or maybe it headed back down to the river . No , I don 't think so . Here ! He 's heading north ! To the tree house ! - The tree house . - Exactly where I 'd go . Roxton ! Thank God . We were starting to worry . Where 's Veronica ? I see you found your hat and your weapons . What is it ? What 's the matter with you ? What 's wrong , Roxton ? Is Veronica all right ? Where is she , Roxton ? Say something ! John ? What are you doing ? That must be Veronica now . Oh , there 's two of them ! No ! No . Not Marguerite ! No ! Damn No ! Roxton . Are you okay ? Challenger ! It 's me you want ! Come and get me ! Here I am ! Come and get me . Not so invincible after all . Ready when you are . I hate leaving you alone like this , Challenger , but Roxton needs all the help he can get . - This thing is like a one-man army . - His darker side . The ruthless hunter he might have ... been without the benefit of his higher faculties . Thank God for evolution . Are you sure you 're going to be all right ? Well I 'm no good for travelling , but I can still handle a rifle . You , ready ? Yeah , let 's go . You be careful , I want you all back in one piece . Including Roxton . Including Roxton . Do we even know if we can kill this thing ? - Everything dies , Marguerite . - I 'm not so sure about that . What is it ? One of them is bleeding ! Which one ? Nothing ! Surely ... think one of this journals will provide some inside ... and no . Oh , Malone ... Based on everything I know about science ... your presence here is impossible . But ... If you know something that will help us ... I 'm willing to make an exception . This is not a game ! Show me , Malone ! Show me what you know ! Found this the 8th of May a cemetery of some sort . on the sore of the inland sea . Dinosaur 's bones , scattered everywhere ... the only clue to its origin maybe these hieroglyphics . It 's done monument of mamut tusk . Where is our translator when we need her ? This only one thing for it , find her ... Come on my friend . We 'll end it right here . Now what ? It 's him , run ! - My rifle ! - Leave it ! Leave it ! Leave us alone . We 're not looking for any trouble . Speak for yourself . Go ahead , you brute . What you are going to do ? NO ! NO ! Roxton ! - Marguerite ! - Run ! Run ! Run ! - NO ! - NO ! - Marguerite ! - Roxton ! No ! Marguerite ! Marguerite ! You lay a hand on her , my friend , and I 'll rip your heart out . If you have one . He 's heading for the graveyard ! Good Lord ! Veronica ! What did Roxton do to deserve a brother like you ? You know who I am , don 't you ? You know what I mean to him . Say something ! You look like him , but that 's as far as it goes . Maybe in a million years you 'll be able to understand it like he does , but you will never be the man he is . NO ! Where are you going ? I haven 't finished talked to you yet ! You 're nothing but an animal ! Do you hear me ? A savage , brainless brute ... The very antithesis of him ! You feel it don 't you . The emptiness . The difference between the two of you . You want to be like him ! Kind ... gentle ... capable of something more than just mindless violence . I see it in your eyes . The pain , loneliness . How sad it must be to never know the warmth of another living being . To never feel their love . Do you know what that is ? Love ? It 's to value ... another person 's life and happiness more than you do your own . To willingly lay down your life for theirs . The man you want to be , taught me this . He 's taught me more than anyone I 've ever known ! He helped me find this love within myself . I love him ! And I never told him ! If there is anything of him in you ... maybe I could love that too . Don 't walk away ! Please ! Untie me ! - Challenger ! - It 's all right , this is me . - Where is he ? - He is gone . And taken Marguerite with him , I presume . To use her as bait to get to Roxton . That will be my best guest . Look what I found in Malone 's journals . - He pointed it out . - You saw Malone ? No ! No . Unlikely as it may seems ... I believe he saw me and you we needed his help . He 'd visited the dinosaur graveyard where Roxton ran into Oceena . And he copied down these hieroglyphics . Do you think Roxton can use this to shake the curse ? I don 't know , if possible , but Marguerite is the linguist , we need her to translate . We 'd better go and find them , let 's go . That 's better , A little closer . Touch my face , feel my hair . Don 't be frightened . You feel it ? The warmth , the love ? I 'm yours ! Untie me and we will be together always ! Do it . Do it now ! Please . Marguerite ! No , no , It 's just us . No one else is there ! No one else is there . - Roxton ! - Marguerite ! Oh thank God ! Are you all right ? What has he done to you ? Oh ! Nothing you can 't fix . NO ! No . I wonder where you had ducked to . Oh damn ! If you insist . Tell me when you 've had enough . Get up ! Roxton , get up ! That 's the best you can do ? Right here , my friend . Right here . What are you doing ? You 're mine ! Kill him ! Kill him ! I beat you . I finish you . What are you doing ? Roxton ... No ! Roxton , Roxton Say something , say something ! What 's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this ? That must be Oseena The mercy you have shown surprises me . Perhaps there is reason to hope that your own compassion will continue to rule over your darker passions . Your newfound respect for life has lifted the curse . Now leave this sacred place . Wiser . And in peace . Roxton ! Is it really you ? Never better , it would appear . I think we 'd better get out of this place before the guardian changes her mind . The sooner the better . Cementeries are for the dead . Well you know what ? He wasn 't so tough ! Oh ! Your darker side left quite a mess around here , Roxton given us the perfect opportunity to evaluate my latest invention . A manual vacuum cleaner Looks like more work than a broom . When 's the last time you pick up a broom . The original vacuum cleaner were as big as a lorries . At least this one is compact and portable . I feel a little funny flapping my arms up and down like this . Yes , Like some kind of animal . Hopefully not like the one that came out of you . Well I feel fine , like a new man in fact . Not too civilised , I hope . Why , Marguerite , whatever do you mean ? Listen ! Since the dawn of time , the world has been a brutal place . Animals killing animals , but only for survival . Man alone stands in opposition to this natural law . But here in this sacred place , there is peace . All who enter must respect the sanctity of life , and those who cannot control the beast within , will by it be consumed . So that 's what it said , So it seems , Roxton , your act of mercy saved you from yourself . And made you whole again . I wonder what other ... little secrets Malone scribbled down in here . I think you should show more gratitude . Oh ! Sorry . Very well , Malone ... If you can hear me , thanks for the contribution . But do me a favour next time , speak a little sooner ? What have we here ? Another of Malone 's journals . More bloody trouble , no doubt ! *

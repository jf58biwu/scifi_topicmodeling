 Are you with me there , Mama Bear ? Oh yeah , Farscape . I 'm reading you loud and clear . Authorizing flight computer to initiate acceleration sequencing ... now . Roger Farscape , you are go for insertion procedure . Farscape One , hold a moment . Hold ? Canaveral , what ? Meteorology reports some kind of electromagnetic wave . Repeat , some kind of wave ! John , do you read me ? Son , you have to abort ! Abort now ! I only know what the doctor told me . What the hell ? I think he 's gonna come out of it on his own . Right . I 'll call you if there are any changes . Goodbye . John ? That 's my name . Don 't wear it out . Nurse ! Call a doctor . How you feelin ' ? Uh , hot . Dizzy . Kinda ... feel like I 've been hit by a house . You 're gonna be okay , son . You gave us all quite a scare . I told 'em you were a survivor . Yeah , I am that . It 's good to have you back , son . What are you doing ? Son ! I 'm not your son ! Get him off me ! Get off me ! Get your hands off of me ! Get your hands off 'a me ! Let go ! Don 't touch me ! Aeryn , Aeryn ! Right , we 'll need full restrains and can you get me a clean I. V. please ? Jesus , get 'em off ! Get 'em off me ! Get the ba ... a ... . this is not real . It 's not real . My name is John Crichton ... an astronaut ... radiation wave hit me ... I got shot through a wormhole ... lost in some distant part of the universe ... on a ship a living ship full of strange alien life - forms ... help ... Listen please ... Is anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm Being hunted by an insane military commander ... Doing everything I can ... I 'm just looking for a way home . Aeryn ? Honey ? Could you get me out of these straps ? What happened ? Last thing I remember I was on a commerce planet . Mister Crichton . My name is Doctor Bettina Fairchild . Not Aeryn . Bettina ? Cool name . Still disoriented ? You have no brain damage as far as we can tell . You do have a fever , probably a low grade infection , but some antibiotics should clear that up . Might clear your head as well . Hey , are they listening to us ? Is that why you can 't talk ? Violent and now paranoid . Perhaps another CAT scan would be indicated . Sorry . I uh ... fuzzed out there for a minute . What day is it today ? Today is Monday . Monday . It 's been a week since you crashed . I crashed ? I don 't remember ... crashing . But I ... I did have this ... this ... this terrible nightmare . I was on a ship full of aliens . Is that why you went after your father and bruised two of his ribs ? Yeah . He ... he looked like he was human but ... he had alien goo on the inside that was ... pretty freaky , huh ? But now you know better ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm all clear . Look , I 'm not gonna hurt anybody , you can ... you can let me out of these straps . You called me Aeryn . Old girlfriend . You - you look a lot like her . Except you have prettier hair . Is my dad around ? Out in the lounge , I think . I 'd ... I 'd like to say I 'm sorry . Probably best you did that yourself . Thank you . Do you good to move the muscles . Thank you , Mister Crichton . Would the owner of the green van parked outside of admissions , please move it immediately . You will be towed . Won 't get fooled again . H - hey , you mind ? Sorry , I thought it was co - ed . Co - ed ? What planet are you from ? Not this one . Hey ! Yo , yo , dude , uh are you done with that paper ? Yeah , sure , here you go . Thank you . No problem . 'Gater victim number six . Last week it was five . They 're gettin ' the details right . Hey ! Hey . How you doin ' ? Well , I 'm better . I 'm um much , much better . Look , I am uh ... . sorry about earlier . No need to apologize , son . You 've been through a lot . I lost it myself when your mother died . Mom ? Papa Bear ! DK ! you made it this time ! Glad you 're up and about , man . I 'm sick of getting reamed on my own . Oh , getting reamed , are we ? Well , IASA 's got a blown mission . They 're tossing ' around words like " pilot error " . There was no pilot error . It was meteorology 's screw up . They didn 't give him enough warning about that electro - magnetical wave . He was told to abort a dozen times . He did abort ! Yeah , not soon enough ! He blacked out . And he still managed to land the module . He trashed the sucker ! The Farscape project 's circling the drain . Okay , what do you want me to do ? Pull it together . First thing you need 's a clean bill of health . Doctor Fairchild says you 're okay physically . But she 's not gonna kick you loose without a full psyche report . Doc Betty said that ? That 's right . You gotta get shrunk . She wants you see a ... Doctor Kaminski . Doctor Jean Cominski Man , hot in here . Hello ! Yeah , hey , uh , I 'd like to order a pizza . Um , medium . Deluxe . Man , these guys are good . Thank you Charles . Sorry to keep you . Zhaan . Zhaan . Adjective or name ? It 's a name . Then I 'm afraid you 're mistaken . I 'm Doctor Kaminski . Uh huh . And uh ... you are a psychiatrist ? I don 't think so . On Earth , psychiatrists don 't come in blue . Do you have a problem with people of color ? I have a contextual problem . You 're an alien . Yes , that 's true . But I do have a Green Card . Interesting . Are you or are you not , blue ? Would it matter to you if I was ? Do you always answer a question with a question ? Does that bother you ? Stop it . Facts ! You 're a Delvian . A plant . Tenth level Pa U. We shared Unity once . Shared Unity . Interesting euphemism . No , Mister Crichton , you and I have never had sex . I 'm sure I 'd remember if we had . Put your hands on my face . Humor me . Just ... Here . Damn . What were you expecting ? Expecting ... ... nothing . Hoping for an ally . You feel you don 't have any allies ? Not in this joint , no . And my enemies haven 't revealed themselves yet . And who are they ? The Ancients ? Nah , they picked my brain already . Maldis . Mm mm . Not his style . Not Gothic enough . Delvians . Mmmm . Yeah . Occums Razor . Talyn and her wacky bunch . Come out , come out where ever you are , and see the young man who fell from the star . Kim , cancel my three o 'clock appointment . In fact , cancel the rest of my day . Hey ! What 'd ya tell her ? Oh , trauma , stress , crash , you know . Made me imagine things . Everything she wanted to hear . But hey , I 'm all better now . So you got a clean psyche report . Great ! Yeah , go ... Figure that . She let me loose . I woulda locked me up in a padded cell . Yeah ! Ooooh , ladies . You know that guy ? Gary Ragle . Newest hot shot to come out of IASA astronaut training . Watch you back , he 's got ambition . Gary Ragle ... has tentacles . Yeah . Oh my God ! Oh my God it 's a straight boy ! What , he looks normal to you ? It 's a lifestyle choice . Anyway , his looks are the least of his problems , he 's a jerk . Hey DK , how you doin ' ? Ooo , missed it there . How you goin ' ? You almost ran us down , Ragle . Yeah , not even close my friend . How you doin ' ? My name 's Gary Ragle . I know you , you are John Crichton , I 've heard you 're one hell of a flier ! Let 's go get a beer . We don 't have time for a beer . Ooo , no time for beer ! Beer ? Keys . My friend , one thing you have to learn . There is always ... time for beer . I got a theory , though . You wanna hear it ? No . This is an experiment . Somebody 's messin ' with my mind . Tryin ' to see which way I 'll move next . Sorta like a ... . rat in a maze kinda thing , huh ? That 's right . I am some alien 's personal science project . I so know how you feel . You know , life 's a bitch ! Let 's get another drink . Hyde ! I 've got a plan , though . Cause they 're testing ' for reactions to the freak show . I 'm not gonna react . Let 'em deal with that . Yeah ! Yeah ! Hey . Buy a girl a drink . Oh ... my ... God ! The off duty Doctor ! Join us . Gary Ragle ! Meet Doctor Bettina Fairchild ! Hi . Hi . Excuse me . Do you two know each other ? No . Never met . How about another ale , eh ? What ? Another drink ! More drink ! Come on , eh ? Three more drinks ! Yeah , I got it . Pitcher of beer . Sure . Dig your style , Ringo . John , we haven 't got much time . Twins . Pity your mother . Now you listen to me , he ... he is not real . Oh . Right . You are . So , what 's your name ? Who do you play in this fun house ? You know my name . Scorpius . Scorpy . You don 't fit the pattern . You got no Halloween costume . Got no assumed name . You 're not playin ' a role . That suggests something to me . It suggests , that you are the man behind the curtain ! In fact , I 'm the only one that can help you . So what are you lookin ' for this time ? You lookin ' for wormholes again ? Huh ? In fact , I have to leave now , John . Nu uh ! You aren 't goin ' anywhere ! Okay . Let 's talk . You 're not Zhaan , you 're not a psychiatrist but you 're as close as I 'll get to either one . I 'm flattered , somewhat . Look , somebody is gas lighting me ! It 's probably Scorpius . G - gotta ... gotta ... gotta be Scorpius . Been having hot flashes of the bastard ever since he stuck me in the Aurora chair . W - what am I supposed to think ? W - what is this ? I ... I never left Earth ? Uh ... uh the whole Moya thing i - i - i - is - is - is an illusion ? It 's ... it 's a dream ? What does that get him ? The thing is , he didn 't start out too badly . You know ? Th - they didn 't make the mistakes that the last guys did . Even Aeryn . Even Aeryn I could 've bought . Probably not , but I ... I coulda bought it . Aeryn . You may have caught a glimpse of Doctor Fairchild . She treated you after your crash . Yeah , and my feverish imagination turns her into a Peacekeeper chick ? So what 's the game ? I wish I could help you , Mister Crichton . It 's strange . I miss Moya . A ship full of aliens becomes so normal . There is of course another interpretation for your confusion . Yeah . I 'm still on Moya . I 'm gibbering . I 'm drooling , and everybody 's wondering what finally made me snap . That is one possibility . Maybe . Son ? Got some news . Oh yeah ? What is it ? IASA 's brought in a new project administrator . A ... Douglas Logan . We can 't afford to piss this guy off , John . He 's a tough bastard . So what ? Listen , tough guy or not , right now your future 's in his hands . Thin face ? Pale skin . Bad set of choppers , likes leather ? I 've only talked to him on the phone , I don 't know . Nasty piece of work , though . Nasty ! Excellent ! Let 's talk to him . Come on ! Nice digs , man . Hey ! Come in . You 're late ! Guido ! You 're here ! Ho , hey , fellas , meet the new boss ! Not the same as the old boss . - Mr. Logan , please excuse my son , he 's been ... hut up ! So ! You 're the reckless son of a bitch who refused to abort , fainted and wrecked a multi - zillion dollar module ! That 's me . Ah , astronauts . Cockier than God , all of them . Give me one good reason I shouldn 't fire your ass and shut down the whole Farscape project ! Sir , the ... the project could still bring great benefits to this organization . John 's experiment 'll pave the way for deep space exploration , Sir . Cork it already ! D. Logan . Quit it with the cards ! Now listen up . IASA can 't afford another failure . We get your sorry project right on the second attempt . Quit it with the cards ! People will forget about the first . Second attempt . Yes . The one I just authorized . Now you can fly it , or Gary Ragle can . I hate to reward failure , but it 's better P. R. if you fly it . Public loves come from behind wins ! John , the module could be ready within two weeks . You can do it again , son . Prove your theory 's correct . So that 's the play . The play . The play , the play is the thing . I re - enact ... my initial mission . I show you how ... I create the giant blue twister that sucks me down to Oz . Forget about it . Don 't know how I did it . Crichton ! Hey Scorp ! Are you outta your mind ? You think if I knew how I did it I would help you ? Get lost ! Who the hell are you talking to ? Oh , um ... not you . You 're not real . What ? Mister D. Logan . Wha ... ? Where are you going ? What the hell was that about ? Are you tryin ' to sink the Farscape project ? - The guy gives us a second chance and you throw it back in his face ! - Hi girls . The guy , the guy ! The guy ... the guy ... the guy 's a two foot green slug on a ... on a golf cart ! What does a man 's disability have to do with anything ? Crichton ! Crichton ! Son , apologize to him . Please . Crichton I wasn 't finished with you ! Oh honey , I 'm sorry , let 's kiss and make up ! Oh ! Are you deranged ? Why yes of course I am , - lemme show you how I crash landed the Farscape module . - I should have your hide ... It was an electro - magnetic ... whoa ... son , you must abort ! Abort now ! john ! Noooooooo ! Crichton ! Crichtooooooo - ! What ? It 's ain 't real . They made you up out of my memories ! It 's just ... annoying that you 're acting exactly the way I thought you would ! And you ! Look at you ... Look at you ... you 're crapping ' yourself , because you think you 're gonna lose your job . And Dad , you 're just pissed off because I ain 't playin ' the game your way ! It is annoying . Go away . Go home . Home . Go home . Shoo . Hey . - Hi ! how 's it going ? - Coma Estas , Hombre ! John , I want you to meet a good friend of mine , this is Jessica . Oh my God . Everybody 's finally here . You 're an astronaut , too ? Yeah . Oh oh I like astronauts . You 're an astronaut groupie ? Yeah . That so works for me . You want to go for a drive ? No , John . We must speak . Does anybody see the ... freak in the next booth ? - Uuuuhhh ... nope . - No . - No . Then let 's go for a drive . Yeah ! We 're on fiiiiiiiiiiiire ! Come on John , you 're drivin ' like a chicken ! I 've got a new theory on life . You wanna hear it ? Oh yeah , man , lay it on me , lay it on me ! Life sucks , nothing matters , screw it all , let 's partyyyyy ! I am so there ! Me , too ! Enjoy it while it lasts , Johnny - boy ! You betcha , especially when nothin 's real . This is no time to be having fun , John . Get lost . You 've gotta focus . Fight this delusion . What , like I believe anything that you 'd say ? Get over it . John . John ! Listen to me . It 's time to bail , Scorpy . Good morning . The truck won , I 'm afraid . And how are our friends ? Gary and Jessica ? Mm . Yeah . They 're fine . As a Doctor ? Don 't you think a crash like that woulda killed us ? Well , we were very , very lucky . Oh yeah . Now . You have a visitor . Who ? Dad ? DK ? Someone new . Uh , a Sheyang ? Captain Bialar Crais ? Bring 'im on ! Thank god you 're okay ! I came as soon as I could . Don 't . This is a pretty good trick . Considering you 're dead . Mom . I had to come . Oh sweetheart . You 're not real . You 're sweating . Don 't worry . No , no . Don 't worry . There . I 'll make everything alright . There , my Johnny . There , there . there . That 's it . Yes . You 've changed . People change to survive . But did you have to lose so much ? You were so innocent . So full of wonder ! It 's all gone . You 've become callous . You 've killed ! You can 't know that . It 's true , isn 't it ? That 's what bothers you . That 's why you can 't sleep nights . I sleep fine . Where are you going ? Away from something that isn 't my mother . Are you going to leave without saying goodbye ? Alright . Let 's do this . Let 's talk . What about ? About what 's goin ' on . Well I 'm on my break , my man . Why don 't you give me a break , my man . Well that 's all I 've got for you man . I don 't know you and I don 't care for your problems . Yeah , great , you 're not the guy . You 're not the guy ... .. I need to talk to . Hey Carl , Carl , get this man a drink . Comin ' up . John ? Help me . You 're not real . I need you . I 'm afraid . You 're - you 're not real , they pulled you out of my mind ! You died five years ago ! John . I 'm scared ! I just want ... out of this . Stay with me , this time . Be with me when I go . No , please , this ... please ! Plea ... Please . I don 't know ... oh god ! This is cruel ! This is cruel . P - please don 't . I need you . with me . Please don 't . Don 't do this to me ! Got a problem , pal ? Well , well . If it isn 't the good Captain . Would I be patrolling a beat if I made Captain ? Hell , I 'm still bucking ' to transfer to plain clothes . And give up the uniform ? Bad choice . Say , you 're that John Crichton guy , aren 't you ? That astronaut . I don 't know . Few too many , huh ? I don 't know who I am anymore . You better come back to the station with me and sleep it off . Just leave me alone . Please . Just ... I 'm gonna get you off the streets , Mister . ... leave me alone . Don 't .. touch me ! Leave me alone ! Leave ... me ! Me ! Me ! Me ! Me ! Oh , my . Look at this . Ah , Mister Crichton . Delighted to see you again . We 're just discussing your future . Well I don 't have a future . Not in this reality . Son , you 're in no shape for this . You 're clearly feverish . John , be careful . You 're risking a full cognitive dislocation . Oh , I 'm about as cognitively dislocated as they get . But I am clear on one thing . Scorpy can either let me loose , or watch me go berserk . More berserk , I 'd say . You seem obsessed with this Scorpius person . Can you tell us why ? It can 't be healthy for you . You 're not real . Or ... you 're in on the plot . Either way , doesn 't really matter what I do . I 'm disappointed in you . You 're holding us up , John . Can we please get on with our meeting , now ? Is anyone else hungry ? I 'm starving . Shall we send out for some lunch ? Oh , anything but Thai food . Pizza ? No , I 'm sick of pizza , how about Deli ? Corn beef on white for me . Stoooooooooooooooop ! Have you any idea how much trouble you 're in ? Yeah . Do you ? I like you 're style Hombre , but this is laughing matter . Assault on a police officer ! Theft of police property . Illegal possession of a fire arm . Five counts of attempted murder . That comes to ... twenty nine dollars and forty cents . Cash , check or credit card . Toto . This thing is going completely off the rails . Or maybe I have . Not yet , you haven 't . But there 's a danger you will . You 're here . Bring the keys ? It 's not me that 's doing this , John . It 's a Scarran . He captured you on the Commerce Planet . I don 't know any Scarrans . What would a Scarran want with me ? Well now that the Scarrans know I 'm after you , they want to know why . This their um ... standard method of interrogation . Induced delusions to break down all ... mental defenses . The Scarrans aren 't trying to fool you , John . They 're trying to break you . This is a deliberate ... attempt to drive you into insanity and it 's working . Your mind is about to crack . And I cannot allow that . I was here , first . No you weren 't . True . The Ancients were here first , implanting the wormhole knowledge I seek . But when my Aurora chair failed to unlock that information , I had to implement ... a second strategy . You put something in my head . A very sophisticated Neural chip . It contains ... well ... it contains me . Or a mental clone of my um ... personality . That explains the visions I 've been having . Precisely . I was supposed to have remained hidden but uh , now then your subconscious would become aware of me . That 's why I couldn 't kill you on the ... Royal Planet ? Of course . A simple fail - safe . But my main function ... is to access the wormhole knowledge you have in your brain . No matter how long that takes . You 're Harvey . Or is it Clarence ? Guardian angel . Invisible rabbit . Harvey . Harvey . Does the Scarran know you 're here ? I only manifest myself when the Scarran 's attention is elsewhere , as it is now . I must disappear when he returns . Ignore the false Scorpius he has created . And do not confide in anyone else you may encounter . How do I know you 're telling the truth ? You 're sweating , John . You 've been unusually hot all this time , because ... because your real body ... is reflexively responding to his heat . The heat a Scarran produces . And when your body temperature lessens slightly , the Scarran is elsewhere , preparing another onslaught . It must not succeed . How do I stop it ? Focus . Concentrate on what is real . Your true memories of Earth , of Moya , your family , friends . Even your enemies . Do not allow yourself to be pushed over the edge . But remember this : the Scarran ... has not disarmed you . Your weapon is of no consequence to a Scarran . Their skins ... are extremely tough . Pistol fire will not kill a Scarran before he kills you . So , you 're best chance is not to shoot but ... But to what ? The temperature 's rising , I must go . To what ? Harvey ! But to whaaaaaat ? Oh , you look like you 're ready to have some fun . We certainly are . What are you doin ' ? Nothing you won 't like . Nothing you haven 't already fantasized about . Admit it , you 've had sexual thoughts about all of us , haven 't you ? Not me . Well , come on ! You 're a male . It 's just the way you were wired . Nothing to be ashamed of , not when females are willing . So what 's your pleasure , boss ? I 'm a Doctor , just relax . I can wear a Freudian slip . I 'll find new places to take your temperature . I can teach you left handed Latvian Rotator Torture . All of you bitches , out now . Crichton is mine . This is for calling me Sparky ! And this is for Fluffy . And this is for Buckwheat . Whatever that means . Oh ! Leaving so soon ? I wish I could ! Look at what you made me do , John , open my veins ! You made me loose my job , you dumped me for your new pals ! Some friend you are ! Some friend you are , man ! Oh come on , Papa Bear , look at what depths your son has driven us to ! Don 't look at me ! You 're the one who wanted a child ! I wanted a Terrier ! Oh , you couldn 't give me what I really wanted ! Oh , so we get this loser ! He can 't fetch a ball , he can 't get my slippers , - he can 't even land a damn module in one piece ! - Oh no , Don 't hurt my baaaaby Freeze ! You 're under arrest . You have the right to the remains of asilent attorney ! If you cannot afford one , tough noogies ! You can make one phone call ! I recommend Tracy : 976 - Triple 5 - LOVE . Do you understand these rights as Ihave explained them to you ? Well do you , punk ? No Then I can 't arrest you ! John , I really need to just unburden myself on you . What ? Well ... lately , I 've been thinking about you in a very different way . And I was wondering if you would mind participating with me in a little Luxan bonding ritual ? Here 's the thing , okay ? What we need are : some chains , uh my Qualta Blade , just a little squirt of Lutra oil and ... oh ! Chiana Chiana . Yeah . She wants to watch . Oh no . Oh yes . Such a fascinating library you have ! Such wonderful informative books . The Oedipus Complex ? I 'm not sure ... I grasp that concept . Could you um ... explain it to me , Johnny ? No . Oh , please ? You 're such a smart boy . I really ... I really want wanna know . Hey John ! Get down and boogieeee ! Boogie - oogie - woogie ! Hey man , get down ! Boogie on dooooown ! Oh , no - no - no - no - no ! I don 't boogiieeeeee ! Crichton ! Crichton ! Where are you ? Where are you ? Where are you ? Where are you ? Clear the floor ! Clear the floor ! Clear the floor ! Searched half this world for you . Where am I ? Still on the Commerce Planet , but underground in some sort of holographic chamber . I destroyed the projector . Who nabbed me ? Scorpius . Sc ... I killed him . Scorpius . So ... he was behind this ? Was being the operative word . That 's interesting . Why is it interesting , John ? It 's ... just that he , uh ... Tell me . Later . Let 's uh ... let 's get out of here . No . Tell me now . No . No , you get nothin ' from me . Frell you , then . Stay . Boogie on dooown ! Hey , yo ! Kiss my friend you are , man ! ... thinking about you ... Then I can 't arrest you ! Be with me when I go . Brain wave patters are increasingly irregular . Captive is finally weakening . Increasing stimuli to ... Kelvo nine . Kelvo ten . Dead ? All neural activity ceased at six three five amneth one . Captive apparently suffered full synaptic overload at stimulus level Kelvo ten . Because no base line data exists with this species , his reaction could not have been anticipated . Remains of the captive will be held for post ... Well done , John . What happened ? I feel like ... . I died . I had to stop your brain function for a few microts ... to divert the Scarran . No harm done . I 'll go back in your subconscious mind , now . Don 't get too comfortable . I 'm gonna get that chip outta my head . There 's no chip in your head , John . Yeah there is . You ... told me that ... . ... . there 's a um ... . m ... you were saying ? M - m - mental chip in m ... As you were saying ? What am I saying ? As it should be . I won 't trouble you again . Until I need to . There 's an exit to your left , which will no doubt take you back to the surface of this Commerce Planet . I leave you to your shipmates , John . But rest assured , I 'll be with you always . Keeping you safe .

 25.000 Previously on Farscape ... I am Pathfinder Neeyala . Wormhole technology ... Garnered at great cost ... with potential beyond measure . Moya was sucked down a wormhole and spat out again . What happened in the middle ? We were not harmed , merely ... . - examined . - By who ? - Neeyala 's pathfinder buddies ? - I ... couldn 't say . Tres ... dos ... uno . I 've finally figured out wormholes . You did it . All that wormhole nonsense we put up with ? Yah . I can get you home ... if I knew where home was or ... where we are . And now , on Farscape ... Exist . Exist ... ence . Existence . Existen .. ee ... How 's the English ? They start small , they grow and then they change . I don 't know ... twenty-six symbols . It should be easy . Well , they can barely escape their own gravity . He 's been out there a long time . Oh , yah ... he seems to like this particular wormhole for some reason . He just learned to speak the language of wormhole . Worm ... hole . Worm ... hole . If you want to get him back ... that 's not the language you need to learn . John , are you there ? We 're on secure comms . Is there a problem ? I just caught this apothecary placing drugs ... in your quarters . She says they help you forget Aeryn . They just dull the pain . Do they work ? When I double the dose , yah . How much perspective have you lost ? You know if you take anything this witch gives you , you halve the dose . D 'Argo ... it ain 't none of your business , so forget about it . I could make something that will help you remember ... Oh ! Soulless Luxan ! John . Oh , John . You have to let her go . It 's more complicated than that . Crichton out . How is Moya doing ? Much better not that her new filters are blocking this region 's electrostatic surges . Excellent ! Next thing you have to do is get over your fear of wormholes . Defying all logic , Crichton may actually figure out how to get us away from the Peacekeepers forever . Without disrespect ... he oftentimes leaps to conclusions prior to leading us into ... Not here Pilot . Trust me . I wouldn 't have risen to Dominar if I wasn 't good at recognizing things before they happen . You were deposed in a coup led by your own cousin . Hmm . Just be ready . None of them seem to take your warnings very seriously . Why should they ? They ... have only anecdotal evidence of what the Scarrans intend unlike you and I. Should I accept your proposal ... to be allies ... what assurances do I have that you will watch my back ? Apart from the pleasantness of the task you instantly ... become the most important one to me . Most important save ... Crichton ? Always save Crichton . Agreed . Three ... two ... one . Ain 't you a beautiful thing ? Damn ! Check this puppy out . Hey , Pilot . About time for that pickup , I think . John ? Break out the docking web anytime now . Pilot ? Pilot ? Pilot ! D 'Argo ... you might want to get the ship ... Pilot ! ... ready . Subtitles : PK SUB-66 Unrealized reality ( 4x11 ) Kansas ... In winter . D 'Argo ... Pilot ... Oh , hell . I 'm gettin that " goin to the island of misfit toys " thing . Or just waitin on the Titanic . Well , as long as this whole deal doesn 't end up with me as an old man . Hello ! Nanook ? Beelzebub ? Yah . Let 's get it on , get it over with . Nice threads . Helps to humanize you . Makes it easier for me to sympathize with your problems . Time . Time . ... zzup ? Time . Flies . Time . - Bandits . - Time . Wounds all heels . - Time . - Rosemary and thyme . - Time . - Zzup ? Time . Either stop pointing guns at people , or get a bigger gun . Time is ... ? Infinite . Relative . You are quite a simple organism to possess the knowledge you do . You 're only sayin that ' cause you don 't know me . Time is meaningless , and yet it is all that exists . Very Morrissey . - My name is Joh ... - Yes . - And yours is ... ? - Unimportant to our encounter . Exactly . I love how you lay it out there Einstein . So , let me ask you without ... getting existential on me ... why am I , why are we ... here ? You are present to perish . I am present to affect that outcome . Oh , my god . Day one . How y 'all doin ? My name 's John . John Cri ... Got to wait for the translator microbes , buddy . ... answer him quickly . You know how Luxans can be . - Oh , you betcha ! - Your ship , what kind is it ? It 's a ... four cylinder . Got a plastic Jesus on the dashboard . Pilot ! I demand you give me maneuverability , now ! There is nothing I can do . Not while the control collar is in place . Hey ! Why don 't you try ripping out that control panel ? Moya can 't withstand this assault much longer . Herrre 's Rygel ! Hey , Sparky ! They brought you onboard , didn 't they ? Don 't worry . I 'll protect you . I 'll look after you now , you look after me later . No offense , Buckwheat , but you couldn 't look after a Chia Pet . Why don 't we move this along ? What is the matter with you people ? ! Tongue . Thank you . Thanks for the memories . - Where 's the rest of my suit ? - This atmosphere will sustain you . Space and time are fused . A set of coordinates for each required to locate a specific event . Everything happens ... at a time ... in a place . Relativity . Movement at speed through space ... becomes movement through time . Einstein again . 1905 . You publish anything since ? Wormholes bridge space-time ... creating a unique ability to navigate . Yah , wormholes . - Been there , done that . - Many times , it seems . And now you unerringly position yourself prior to them opening . How do you possess such knowledge ? Bad luck . Really bad luck . It 's a long story . Maybe later . The unconscious knowledge we 've given you ... will guide you . No ! You were already on the right path . Get out of my head ! Time ? Ancients ? Yah . I never met ... another man who was ... more in touch with his own feelings . A real hell-raiser . And you couldn 't help but love ' im . Kinda man who would finish a game with a broken leg . Rescued me from out of nowhere ... and dropped me right in the middle of my dream job ... working on the Farscape project . Stephen Hawking is a genius all right , but John is ... more toward that end of the spectrum than the rest of us . He would share whatever he had with the others . I can 't bear to be without him . Sorry . Oh , he was so good in bed . Wormholes are the one feature that traverse both our realms , which adjoin , though never intersect . An aggressive perforation of one would allow an unacceptable incursion of material ... from your existence into ours . And who would want to do that ? The biologics of your realm are infinitely more aggresssive than ours . Perhaps . Why don 't we table that discussion . Tell me about the Ancients . Members of my species ... substantially modified to live in your realm . They 're here to spy on us . Narcs . To catalog , report and influence . When they disappeared , we decided to investigate the state of wormhole knowledge in your realm . You hauled Moya 's ass down a wormhole . I was ... surprised to discover a Leviathan . The expectation was a pathfinder vessel . I have just infused our beacon into the Leviathan superstructure . Those I questioned ... knew nothing of wormholes . They did however mention you repeatedly . He knows . Crichton ... kno ... Wormholes ... are ... his obsession . You set them free to find me . Your knowledge is quite extraordinary for one of your realm . Thanks . And your many travels inside wormholes ... troubling . But now that I 've glimpsed your mind I 'm aware this has made you a target of more aggressive species . A liability ... which must be dealt with . You stay the hell away from me . D 'Argo ? Pilot ? Aeryn ? Pip ? ... Aeryn . It 's you . Ahh ... What the hell 's goin on here ? Frelled . Right up the ass . It 's a great plan you came up with . What about the others ? Dead . Sheyangs got ' em . We 're the only ones left . This is not funny ! We 're done here ! We 'e done , all right . Everything 's gone and we 're next . Okay , if we 're goin to do this ... what about the pods , my module ? Maintenance bay . It 's ... uh ... it 's a furnace . Space suits ? This floor is the only one that isn 't filled with toxic dren . Oh , come on . Just once . You and me , like we should have , from the very beginning . Pip , knock it off . Let 's just get out of here . Come on , Crichton . We 're gonna die . I just want to die doing something fun . Something I like ... Something that makes me feel good . Your plan didn 't work . This is mine . No ! Spectacular . Boy , I got to hand it to you . You give great ... great illusion . Now I know how ... Copperfield got Schiffer . What you experienced was real . Well , it felt real . Real . Real like ... the water 's not wet ? Real like you see with no eyes ? Time . Wormholes . The knowledge to unravel events . For that alone , I should kill you . As a Pa 'u , I 'm generally the teacher . But with John , I ... I learnt as much as I gave . Whenever he touched me there was an almost electric caring . John Crichton ... made me a better captain . I sensed a ... a purity of spirit better leader purity of soul . ... better man . And I 'm supposed to just take your word for it ? This hair could be as fake as this iceberg , this ... world ... you . That hair represents a possible outcome , an unrealized reality . When he 'd come over , I 'd have to cover up all the mirrors , just so he 'd spend some of the time looking at me . My dad and John 's mom are brother and sister . Crichton blew a key tackle ! My three year old niece could 've tripped this guy up ! It hurt dad ' cause he loved family so much , but ... we were forbidden to hang out with John after he was about fifteen . You know why he 's dead ? Pig-headed . He actually made a couple of passes at me . We weren 't ready for a space trial . Not really . Like I 'm gonna sleep with a guy who only has one graduate degree . He was a cheap date , a lousy drunk and a redneck . If I say " blasphemous " ... I don 't mean his attitudes toward god . I mean ... his attitude toward life . He was lousy in the sack . Damn . I always knew Reverend Miller didn 't like me but ... Caroline that 's a ... that 's a bit of a shock . This wormhole you lingered so long I was able to locate you . Describe this fascination . I don 't know . Something just struck me . It is part of an extensive system . One of untold number which permeate this space and time of your realm . Tell me about ... unrealized reality . Oh , no . This is that dream where I wake up in a cell ... naked . Thank heaven for simple mercies . One out of two . So you won again . Two of three . Officer Aeryn Sun ... Special Peacekeeper Commando , Icarian Company , Pleisar Regiment . My name Jose Jimenez . We got a lot to catch up on . Pretty good , huh ? I learned from the best ... you . Why are you out of uniform ? What is your rank ... and regiment ? Baby , you had me at hello . Rank ... and regiment ... Now . And how ... do you know my name ? What you should really ask ... is how I know you 've got a birthmark on the sweet spot of your hip . Every wormhole system has millions of exits ... each to a distinct time and place ... travel from A to B. Now attempt to travel back . You could arrive at point A immediately after you left or ... a cycle later or a cycle earlier or ten or ten thousand of millions of permutations . The secret ... is understanding time . Not so much understanding as accounting for . Unskilled wanderings create ... unrealized realities . So what you showed me wasn 't real . If I had not pulled you back , where ever it was you went would have become your reality from then on . Does not compute . Are you saying that there 's millions of me running around with millions of pathetic lives ? One of you with millions of potential realities , depending on where and when you emerge from the system if you do . Time . Going forward 's not a problem , is it ? Going backward ... that screws the pooch . Should a traveler appear earlier in the timeline of his own existence , he would be but as a pebble ... cast upon still water . But the ripples he creates would , over time radiate upon far distant shores ... geometrically altering events in its path . And your Ancients gave me just enough knowledge to be dangerous . Without such input , the odds of anyone else actually appearing at a destination they previously occupied is ... so remote as to be mathematically disharmonious . Then why am I not dead already ? I trust the one who entrusted you . But I need to understand why ... he bestowed this ability . Are you afraid of this knowledge ? No . There is still time . Shall we go , Sir ? The Scarran spy , as you commanded . Release her . Sir ? Release ... her . - After what happened , is that ... - Are you questioning my orders ? Release the spy . Now watch . And learn . Be cool ... and no one will get hurt . What of those already hurt ? Someone , sometime has to end the madness . I will never tell you what you want to know . Frankly my dear , I don 't give a damn . I 'm just tryin to keep you alive . Thank you . Guards ! Stop her . Captain ! Stay down ! Weak ... species . That wasn 't me . That 's not me . Whatever it was would be you , could be you . Which is why our vigilance is so high . Why the knowledge to navigate wormholes must be suppressed . And why you trouble me . You want me not to have the knowledge ? Take it out of my head . Kind of surprised that worked . Sorry . This is not me either . My ability to maintain this environment is weakening . Just take back what your Ancients put in my head . Impossible ... impractical and possibly imprudent . What do you desire with wormholes ? For starters ... to go home . Your place of origin is where you can do the most damage . Oh , god . John ! He 's never faithful to his girlfriends . He made it perfectly clear that his work was a greater priority than I was . The womanizing , the drink ... Yes ... I got the point . ... the drugs . The point , yes , but the risk ? People you don 't recognize ? A world changed irrevocably by the toss of a pebble ? - Well just shove me back down the wormhole . - I cannot . Why not ? You did it for Moya and Pilot . Propulsion . You are the first brought here without vehicle . So how the hell am I supposed to get off this rock ? - Through the wormhole . - With what propulsion ? The smoke you 're blowin up my ass ? You ... possess ... the knowledge ! I have little time . From the moment the Ancients implanted that knowledge , you exist to service a larger ... No ! No . That 's what you want . My name is John Crichton . I 'm not your pawn . Then ... let us proceed . John Crichton ? Arrogant . Implusive . Self-absorbed . Insane . Ignorant . You tell me . The guy was an idiot . I once shared ... unity with that ' uuman ' , and the experience still haunts me . Don 't go any further . That is John Crichton . I 'm glad he 's dead . Why don 't you just grab anyone that goes wormholing and be done with it ? Simply the effort to encounter you was massive . We ... can no more function in your realm than you in ours . Which is why the Ancients were important to us . So modify more of your people and send them over . The endeavor ... is in hand , but requires time for metamorphosis . Have you truly chosen to help prevent ... aggressive species from acquiring this knowledge ? As a career ? No . We have little time . And there is much you need exposure to . What 's happening ? I must soon ... reenter my realm . What happens to me ? If you have learned enough to survive ... reinsertion to the wormhole . Now , pay attention ... and listen . Sagaciously . From every point of entry ... a wormhole branches into multiple parts . The subdivision continues until , at last you 're deposited back into space-time . The journey can be random ... or with purpose . Destination is the key . Every portal has a distinct space-time signature . The only destinations you can realize by design are those of which you have foreknowledge . The more you travel , the more signatures you will catalogue . Our Ancients have given you the ability to recognize these subtle differences . Since every destination is surrounded by similar ... unrealized realities the closer you travel the more you must maintain ... absolute engrossment ... And never return to a familiar place ... prior to the last time you left . ... prior to the last time you left . Your next journey ... may lead to a permanent unrealized reality . ... a permanent unrealized reality . He ... here . Hot dog ? Hurry . Hot dog ? Learn ... see ... feel . Did you bring the mustard and onions . Uh ... yah . Glad you could make it , son . Well , I can 't stay long . I got to get back to work . I was hoping we could have a talk . Hot dog ? Yah . I always loved your dogs . Corn on the cob , too . Watermelon . All your favorites . So ... what did you want to talk about ? You . A talk we should have had years ago . I don 't think I 'm still a virgin ... Dad . You can 't beat this . And I hate to see you waste your energy on the impossible . Impossible 's a daily part of my life . You remember what we were like centuries before the Scarrans conquered us ? Weak genes ... disease ... death . I think our health and longevity outweigh some personal freedoms , don 't you son ? No . You never change . But you 're young . I never told you this , but when I was young , I wanted to fly , too . Space . A dream . But it wasn 't to be . And it won 't be for you either . I can 't accept this . Any of it . I know I 'm not much of a hero to you , son . But if it means anything , I 'd still like to walk on the moon . This place disintegrates . Don 't let me go again . You gotta ... you got to put me back in my own time , my own place , but just put me back where you found me . You can do that yourself . I don 't ... understand any of this . There 's nothing to understand . It 's not a science , John . It 's an art . You failed me in Art . Not to mention Third Grade English . And I still do not understand the proper use of a comma ! You did not forget the " a " , Johnny . You wrote a report about Mark ' Twin ' . You can hear me . How do I get back to Moya ? Focus on the space-time signature where you entered the wormhole . Every system is like a maze that loops back upon itself . Focus . Get back to Moya . After you have left her . What if I screw up ? What if I get there before ? - You afraid , buddy ? - Yes . No . Maybe . If you get back to the ship before you left , the pebble that drops will be close to you . Ignore the ripples . Fix the first thing that goes ape . Fix the first thing . Wh ... wh ... what was that about the ripples ? The elasticity of time allows for unrealized realities to remain so . Events are matched closely enough to course they have a way of restructuring themselves to familiar outcomes . If matched closely enough to course , events have a way of restructuring themselves . Harvey knew . Harvey knew . Harvey knew ! Scorpius knew . How ? How ! ? I mean I like him , but he was , ah insolent . ... selfish . ... obsessive . ... obnoxious . ... unbearable . Hey , I think we should run . - You want to run ? Let 's run ! - Chiana ! - Should 've run . - Chiana . - I 'm comin ' ! - What did you find ? Just these . Barely charged . They 're gone ! My love , your love , my love , your love ... our loves ! Gone ! Suicide ! Suicide , and they 're gone ! They 're trying to make peace with the Peacekeepers . What are you doing ? Plot a course . A course . A course ... yes , yes ! You should eat something ... before you die . John Crichton ? Crichton ... Nope . Not in the space program . Glasses ? Accountant . See , our famlilies were never close so I think I only saw him once . I could look him up in the " Who 's Who " . Are you sure I know him ? Maybe he went to state ? At every point of entry ... a wormhole branches into multiple paths ... The subdivision continues until at length your deposited back into space-time . The journey can be random , or with purpose . ... at last you 're ... deposited back into space-time . Destination is the key . Pilot , I demand you give me Starburst now ! Starburst ? Zhaan and Aeryn are out there under a flag of truce . D 'Argo 's regained conciousness . He and Crichton are eager to leave . Don 't ! Don 't ! They 're peaceful ! Please . No ! Cannot leave . My lady , my love , my life ! Transport pod 's loaded with supplies , but there are marauders waiting to shoot us down , we can 't escape ! We 're trapped ? That 's what " we can 't escape " means . Go help Stark hyperventilate . Well , if you 'd just let me negotiate . - We mean you no harm . - No ! Hm . Well , I cou-I could bake something . Since every destination is surrounded by similar unrealized realities the closer you travel the more you must maintain obsolute the closer you travel , the more you must maintain the more you must maintain absolute engrossment . Pilot , where are you , you four-armed tralk ! Right now Moya couldn 't Starburst the length of your stubby little arm ! - This stubby little arm is ... - Is short , as is our ability to maneuver , accelerate , or defend ourselves ! Why doesn 't anything work ? ! Because , slutty tralk , of all the half-frelled modification for HIS wormhole experiments and never return to a familiar place prior to the last time ... you left . Now just why won 't you help us , Crichton ? Because like everybody else here ... I ... don 't wanna be here anymore . - You have to fix what you 've done ! - But ... Fix it ? Can 't you see he 's distracted ? No . Scat . Go on . This ... this will free you ... from any throughts of your betrothed . No , no , no . Honestly , she-she 's not on my mind anymore , Grandma . So big , so beautiful so blue . - Aeryn ! - Blue ? Come back to me ! You 're very pretty . Fix it ! Yes , fix it ! You really should have picked me ... over Zhaan . Absolutely , next time , when I 'm gonna move house . The dren gets worse , morons ! All right , Einstein , anytime now . We haven 't done anything - Einstein ... - Fix Starburst , miscreant species ! Shut up ! Crais , you yotz-fot bastard , we had a deal ! - A deal ! You tried to sell us out ! - You bet your fekkik , tenka-head ! - It 's every Hynerian for himself ! - We 're being blasted apart ! This way , weapons primed . The Peacekeepers have boarded ! Oh , if company 's coming , I can make some skrinberry muffins . - Let 's go and kill Peacekeepers ! - Chiana ! Remain at your post ! No ! Starburst , rig for manual activation . I got it . Well ... that 's it . That 's it , I quit ! Stay at your post , Chiana ! You know , you suck worse as a captain than you did in bed . That was helpful . - Can you fix Starburst ? - I don 't think so . What about your ship ? - What ship ? - Lo 'la . Lo 'la was my wife . - Are you mocking me on death 's threshold ? - Never , Little Big Man , never . Um . Excuse me , but she is having some sort of fit . She 's dying ! - It happens when I 'm stressed . - Stark ! Pull yourself together . Send her to a better place . Oh , please . I don 't wanna die . I don 't wanna go down like that . Heal her pain . You want a fight , you got a fight . Do your worst , but I will never be taken prisoner again ! Aah ! I am bleeding ! Will you look at me ? ! I am bleeding , I am ... Calm down . They 're on board ! We give them what they want ! Anything they want ! Take no prisoners . Dead cannot die ! Corporeal illusion . Return . Replenish . - You ! You shoot me ! Shoot now ! - Comin ' back , Stark ? Always . - No , no , no , no , no . What are you doing ? - Giving her a second chance . - Execute on sight . - Yes , sir ! Shoot now ! My brother 's murderer . You are dead , Crichton . Captain Crais , I am Dominar Rygel the Sixteenth , I trust our deal will be hon ... What you experienced was real ... You afraid buddy ... ? ... wherever it was you went would have become your reality from then on . Are you afraid of this knowledge ? Well done , comrade . Well done . Your next journey ... may lead ... to a permanent to a permanent unrealized reality . I almost ... could not retrieve you . Yeah , I noticed . We 're runnin ' out of real estate . This construct ... disintegrates . Next time ... your reality ... forever . No next time . Leave me . To die ? Why ? Too risky . All of it . Best to leave me . Are you suddenly becoming afraid ? Yes . Of the damage I can do , yes . Fear ... fear is the correct answer . Can 't do it . You 'd rather die ? Not particularly , but I liked my childhood and I don 't wanna scramble the eggs . Should aggressive species puncture the wormhole ... the consequences for both our realms would be unimaginable . Ah , screw it . But I am not Kirk , Spock , Luke , Buck , Flash , or Arthur frelling Dent . I am Dorothy Gayle from Kansas , and you are going to hire more Ancients . Then simply permit yourself to perish prior to reaching a destination . Moya ... after ... Her space-time signature will be familiar . Powerful . Moya . Fear is your providence . Feel The Force . Adjust . Maintain focus . Focus . Harmony . When this is over ... you 're gonna take this crap outta my head . Someday ... should you survive . ... after ... Do you now know what it is ? Time .

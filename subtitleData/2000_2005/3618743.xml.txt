 Artemis ready . Target 's in the channel . Roger that , Artemis . You have a go to launch . Isn 't it amazing up here , Mikey ? Look at the view . Di , you have to admit , it 's pretty spectacular . Yeah , it 's lovely . But it 's pissing down . Michael , can you pass me a yoghurt , darling ? It was either here or Cardiff . I just thought this might be a better place to live . Look , you didn 't even ask us . Sorry . No , not that one . Actually , what is this one ? Can you find me a muesli one instead ? Horror in Stockholm . Ben Johansson , CEO of Estrada Industries was assassinated today in front of the world 's media . - You winning ? - Yeah . They 're saying it was a miniature bomb . Oh , turn that off , love . You know , you 're gonna finish that game soon , and then you won 't have anything left to do . I 've already finished it . Just give it one chance . No ! Hey , Ryan , leave him ! It is an English-speaking school . You 'll make new friends . I don 't want to . Hello ? Hi , Paul . Yes , he is . No , I 'm fine . Well , thanks , Paul . Okay . I 'll get Ryan for you . It 's Paul . Hello , Paul . It was a lovely job , mate . I thought you were gonna have problems with those reporters . Well , it was a bit iffy , but it was a fairly good chance he 'd keep moving with his profile . He 's not the sort to stop and talk to reporters . At least he wasn 't . It was a bloody good shot anyway . No real problems this end . I got reports circulating that it was a miniature bomb planted by unknown sources . So , guess that pretty well wraps it up . Thought they spoke German where you were ? French as well . Very nice . So , listen , I 'll get back to you in a few days when we know this has worked out as planned . Till then , hey , relax . Get some sun . And get that lad of yours back in school . Yeah , we will . He 's just being difficult . I 'll talk to you soon , okay ? Cheers , Paul . Ben Johansson , CEO of Estrada Industries was assassinated today in front of the world 's media . Di , do you want anything from the shop ? Get some bread . The money 's in my jacket pocket . Do you want anything ? Should we go and get some bicycles ? Mr Trooper . - Ryan will be fine . - John . Hi there , Michael . Didn 't get a chance to talk too much when you came by the other day with your wife . Diana , was it ? - Yeah , Diana . - How 're you guys enjoying it up here ? Well , I hope we 're going to see him down at the school soon . I know the other kids are looking forward to meeting him . Well , he 's looking forward to seeing them , aren 't you , mate ? Well , that 'd be a first for a new kid . But really , he 's gonna do great here . Did you know the kids here ski twice a week , year round ? I 'd heard that . Yeah . Right up on the glacier . Fantastic . Well , the parents are welcome , too . Why don 't you come with us sometime ? You working up here , Ryan ? No , no . Now I 'm retired . I was in the battery business , and I did quite well . Wow . A lot of advances in the battery world in recent years . Yeah . I know . Well , I 'm keeping you . I 'm sorry . No , not at all . It 's nice to talk to you . Yeah , it 's been a pleasure . So , listen , if you or Diana want to call me about Michael or anything , I 've lived up here for decades . You know where I am . Okay , gotta move . - All right . Bye . - Right . Bye . Okay , um , saft , bitte . Hello ? Ryan , it 's Paul . - You wanna take over ? - I wouldn 't dare . Hello , mate . Yeah . On my way . Romario Estrada , 41 years old . Has a wife and child . Living in Chile . Wife is called Eudiza . Now , she 's not exactly stable . History of mental health problems . Eating disorders . One suicide attempt , unconfirmed . The daughter is called Yanina . Now , Estrada comes to London twice a year . He stays at the same rented apartment in Kensington . L2,000 a month . Well , that 's it for now . Job is doing a recce tonight , so we can plan to do a dry run tomorrow morning . I 'll have this project 's files sent through by courier later this evening . I 'll speak to you then . You 're very funny , Paul . You okay ? You fancy coming into town with me on Saturday and get a new game ? Dad , will you come skiing with the school if I go ? Course , mate . All right . I 'll go . Okay . Job , will you be able to make sure that that parking space is kept clear for him ? That 's his red roadster , isn 't it ? Yep , got it . Okay , can you give us a quick door-to-door on that ? About nine metres . He 's 6 ' 1 " . Paul , what do you work his gait out as ? One and a half metres a second . Ryan , we got local CCTV online . Job , you 're out of a job , mate . Six seconds , that 's tight . But it 's okay . We can do this . Right , Job , you 're gonna have to be on traffic patrol , then . When we 're live to go , no one moves near the target . We can 't have him moving backwards or forwards when we 've got such a slim margin . Okay , Job , can you step back a pace ? Yeah . Good . Right . On my mark . Mark . Bang . Ryan ! - Welcome . - Hi . - Good to see you . Here he is . - Michael . Now , right through here ... What ? Aren 't you cold ? No . I 'm all right . You 're an idiot sometimes . You know that , right ? Yeah , I know . You just don 't think things through . What are you doing ? Please stop . Michael will see . No , he won 't . Michael 's at school . - You 're such an idiot . - Yeah . This is l-4 . He 's on the home stretch now . L - 1 , all yours . Good luck . L - 1 here . Roger that . I make his ETA three minutes .

Target 's in the channel . Oh , Jesus . They shouldn 't be there . Job , get his attention ! Job , we are still a go . Has he talked to you about it ? No . He 's hardly said anything to me at all . Look , it was a horrible mistake . Totally unpredictable . There 's no way that Ryan could have foreseen what would happen . So what now ? Well , fortunately , the target didn 't pull through his injuries . You guys should get away somewhere . Get your mind off things . Go hiking or something . Yeah , of course . Look , I hate to do this , but you and I both know that Ryan can be unpredictable at times . You have to make sure that he doesn 't do anything silly . Okay ? Of course , Paul . I would anyway . No , Di , what I mean is , we can 't afford to have anyone knowing about Ryan , about what he does . You really need to make sure . For yours and Michael 's sake . As well as for Ryan . It 's Paul . Do you want to say hello ? I think you better speak to him later , Paul . Okay . Bye . I talked with Principal Curtis earlier . He was telling me how well Mike 's fitting in . Good . Good . You know , they 're going skiing tomorrow . Well , we 've been invited . And I thought it 'd be quite nice to go along . You go . Look , I know this is hard for you , but come skiing with us tomorrow . Please . It shouldn 't have happened , Di . For God 's sake , Ryan , enough ! It was an accident . That 's all . You were doing your job . So just get over it . What would you do if it happened to you ? If Mikey and I ... Like that ? I don 't know . No ? Well , I know what I 'd do . I know what I 'd do . Hi . Yeah . I need a ticket to London , please . Mikey , go tell your dad we 're ready to go . - Hello ? - Hey , mate . It 's Dad . - Dad ! - Could you put Mum on for me ? Mum , Dad 's on the phone . It 's him . I 'll call you right back , Paul . - Ryan , where are you ? - I 'm in London . I don 't have much time . I want you to look something up for me on the computer . Of course . Is everything okay ? Yeah , yeah . It 's fine . There 's a list of numbers that the Estradas phoned from their flat in Kensington , and one of them is a dry cleaners . I need the name and the address . Okay . Hang up in a bit , darling . Royal Dry Cleaners . 32 Young Street . You sure you 're okay ? - Has Paul called ? - Yeah , of course he has . Don 't tell Paul anything . And what do you think this woman 's gonna say to you ? I 'm not gonna talk to her . I just wanna see how she 's ... You can 't do this . God , you 're such an idiot . I 've got to go . I love you . No , Ryan , wait , please . Please . Just wait . Please think before you do anything . I will . Chiswick High Street , please . Yes ? Hello , Mrs Estrada ? Yes ? Hi . I 'm sorry to bother you , it 's Royal Dry Cleaners here . We think we 've got some of your husband 's documents , and we were wondering if you could come down and collect them at some point . Now is not a good time . The only thing is that they do seem important . And it would be better if you could come down and check for yourself that they are yours . Okay . I 'll come right down . She 's on her way . To the dry cleaners ? Listen , if I could just speak to her for just a few seconds , face to face ... Ryan , you promised . They won 't let you get anywhere near her . They won 't even know I 've done it . - I 've got to go . Wish me luck . - Ryan ...

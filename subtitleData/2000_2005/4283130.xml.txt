I 'm nobody . There are guys in the background of Mary Worth comics who are more important than me . Buck up meat loaf , Bender will take you out tonight and cheer you up . What do you want to do ? And I mean anything ! You have the power . Name it and I 'm there . You 're the man . Well ... OK . Let 's go bowling . No . Table for two ? Step right this way .

So things aren 't working out with what 's-his-name ? Actually ... they are ... Confidentally I might not make it back at my appartement tonight . Could you up Nibbler for me ? And bring a baggie in case he drops a steamer . Have a great night ! Oh no ! Please no ! Perfect . Smells like a 289 in progress . Failure to scoop ... Oh yeah ! Wait ! I 'm trying . It weight as much as a thousand suns . Don 't worry Fry , I 'll pull some strings and see if I can get you trialed as juvenile . Oh Chaz ! I 'm as worthless as this trash can . You think I 'm as worthless as you ? Try catching garbage in your head and raising six kids , you dumb townie ! At least I 'm important to you , even if it 's only because I clean up your poop . The poop eradication is but one aspect of your importance ! - Did you just talk ? - Indeed . And I have other amazing powers as well . Like what ? Are you my mommy ? Negative . Welcome Lord Nibbler . Welcome Acknowledged . I bring with me ... the Mighty One . At last ! Our centuries upon centuries of waiting have achieved fruition . Aren 't you a fuzzy wuzzy wittle guy . Stop that ! Please ... Your Mightiness Mightiness ? Are you off your nut ? I just got kidnapped by a bunch of guinea pigs . Does he not know ? He does not know . He knows not ? Knows not does he . - Not he knows ? - Enough ! Fry , it is my duty to inform you that the fate of humanity , the fate of our race , indeed , the fate of all that exists and ever will exist , rest with you You are the single most important person in the universe . Oh ! Snap ! On this auspicious occasion , let the horn of eternity cut a thunderous blast ! The feast of a thousand beasts is begun . - You 're gonna eat that ? - Maybe later . The time has come to discuss matters of the gravest importance . Fry , do you remember some months ago when Earth was attack by flying brains ? I remember the square dancing stomachs . Or that might be in the lately commercials . Wait ! The brains ! I do remember ! But no one else does , they said I was crazy On the contrary , you remember because you were the only one immune to the brains mental attack . Because I 'm so smart ? Oh my ! Anyway . Your immunity is due to the fact that you lack the delta brain wave . It 's a genetic abnormality which resulted when you went back in time and performed certain actions which made you your own grandfather . I did do the nasty in the pasty ! Verily . And that past nastification is what shields you from the brains . You are the last hope of the universe . So , I really am important ? How I feel when I 'm drunk is correct ? Yes . Except the Dave Matthews Band doesn 't rock . For a 1000 years the evil brains have been constructing the infosphere . A giant memory bank twice the size of 3 ordinary memory banks . What so evil about that ? They plan to collect all the information in the universe and store it within the sphere . So they try to learn things ? - Right . - Those bastards ! Being brains , they feel compelled to know everything and soon they will . I 'm as mad as I 've ever been . Once their task is complete , they will ensure that no new information arises in the only way possible by destroying the universe . Now , it 's personnal ! Your mission is to infiltrate the infosphere and plant this quantum interphase bomb , blasting them into an alternate universe , from which there is no return . Then outrun the blast on this Scooty-Puff , Jr . OK , let 's go through this once more ... Brains ! Fear not , Mighty One . Your missing brain wave makes you invisible to them . So long as you avoid intense thinking . Sorry , what ? I wasn 't paying attention . - That is most wise . - Who ? In a few seconds , the brains will finish scanning the last bits of information in the universe . Beavers made for life 11 greater than 4 . For quality carpets visit Kaplan 's carpet warehouse Now , the infospere will open is protective crust . So it 's to scan itself , completing its thousands years task . This is your one chance to enter the sphere , Scoot , scoot now . I 'am at the input console . I 'm a little nervous and I 've got brain in my but-crack . Roger . Once you press the detonator , you will have 60 seconds for an exciting escape . Eh wait ! Those brain knows everything about everything , right ? It will soon , that 's why you 're supposed to be setting off the bomb . Yeah yeah . But I can 't pass up the chance to learn the answers to the greatest questions of all time . - Is it true that post stamp glue is made of ... - Correct ! Toad mucus . There 's no time for this , activate the bomb ! Wait , wait , wait . What really killed the dinosaurs ? Me ! Detecting trace amounts of mental activity , possibly a dead weasel or a cartoon viewer . You gross , cut it out ! Odd ... He is immune to our psionic attack ! Impossible , we are an ambitious young squad with everything to prove ! It appears we are in presence of the fabled one . But without his Scooty-Puff , Jr . , he cannot escape . A quantum interphase bomb ? Are you insane in the membrane ? You got it point , Dexter . Not good . Detonation in T-60 earth seconds . You fool ! You 'll be transported into the other universe with us . Trapped there for all eternity . And we 'll form a tightly nitted clique that you wont be part of . At least , I did one important thing with my life ! leading good to victory over evil . - Hourray ! - Exactly ! The Nibblonians ? Good ? During your last moments in this universe perhaps you should query our database concerning the night of December , 31st 1999 . The day I got frozen ? What about it ? No ! Don 't ask about that , euh ... it ... it would be ... boring . Forget it then ... Query ! What append to me Phillip J. Fry on the night of December , 31st 1999 ? Clarification request ! Are you the Phillip J. Fry from Earth , or the Phillip J fry from Howering Squid World 97A ? Earth , you fat idiot . Hurry up . Hello ! Pizza delivery for ... Oh , crud I can 't believe how fat I look ! Ooh , Nibbler 's there . Wait ! What ? ! What the ... I ... I don 't understand , you made me go in the freezer tube ? Detonation in T-15 seconds . You 're the one frozing me ! You took away my life . We can explain . No , you can 't ! Shut your adorable trap . We had no choice . You were the only one who could help us . What is one life weighed against the entire universe ? But it was my life . Detonation in 2 , 1 ... will the owner of the white Pontiac Firebird ... Nevermind , zero . Well , here we are trapped for eternity . We could sing ' American Pie ' . Go ahead , I deserve it . I wish the stupid racoons had never brought me to the future .

It is possible for the Phillip Fry to resume his life on the December , 31st 1999 . Really ? I can go back in time ? There is an access point between universes at the space time where you enter the cryogenic tube , you and only you can return there . Interesting .

You 'll have your life back , and we will succeed in our plan to understand and destroy the universe . Everybody wins ! The human will be returned to the past . Meanwhile ...

I cleaned your poop ! Quite possible . We live long and are celebrated poopers ! You will meet me when I 'm a thousand years older . Not if you don 't freeze me ! Please ! Our sages foresee that in a thousand years , for one moment , the fate of the universe will depend on you ! Since you will not live that long , I must freeze you now . Why could you not just ask me ? We were affraid you would refuse . Of course not ! I love the future . So then ... why are you choking me right now ? Because I don 't like being used . Well , now it 's your choice . Is there nothing in the future worth saving ? Leela . But she doesn 't think much of me .. She must be The Other . Wh ... wha ? You must not give up on her .

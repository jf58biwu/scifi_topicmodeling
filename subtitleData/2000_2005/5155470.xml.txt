 God 's love will set us free . And I believe ... if I pray for that love , if I get down on my knees ... and allow God to enter my hardened , lonely , miserable heart ... and change me through and through , that miracle ... will come . Now , who here believes that with me ? Do you ? - Do you ? - Yes , sir , I believe it . Do you ? Well , believe , because God 's love is not just some slogan . It 's a promise ... straight to you from the Lord Almighty himself . A promise paid for with the blood of His only begotten Son , Jesus Christ of Nazareth . All you have to do is believe . - Amen ! - God 's love will set you free . Now doesn 't that just lift up your heart ... and make you want to say , " Glory ! Amen ! " Glory ! Amen ! Join with me . Allow the spirit ofJesus Christ ... to show you the way up to our Heavenly Father . - Glory ! Amen ! - Glory ! Amen ! Let God 's love free you from your prison ... and deliver you to His side in heaven . - Glory ! Amen ! - Glory ! Amen ! Praise His name . Praise His holy love . - Glory ! Amen ! - Glory ! Amen ! - Glory ! Amen ! - Glory ! Amen ! - Glory ! Amen ! - Glory ! Amen ! Glory ! Amen ! Glory ! Amen ! Glory ! Amen ! Glory ! Amen ! Glory ! Amen ! Glory ! Amen ! Do you believe that , Donny ? That God loves a sack of crap like you ? - The Bible says . - The Bible says you kill women , cut their pinkies , you get to burn in hell . - Glory . Amen . Glory . Amen . - You listening to me ? God 's got a place for you , all right , you sick puke . Then where 's that leave you ? Sorry . It 's not good enough for the Illinois penal system . My hands ! My hands ! Life without chance of parole ... for the premeditated and sadistic sexual murders ... of five Twin Cities women in 1994 . Donald Addy Faster . You two put this man away . Yeah . Someone forgot to throw away the key . That 's another story . Right now we have to apprehend this man . We 'd use all the help you can give us in understanding exactly who it is we 're after . Donny Faster is a death fetishist ... a collector of bone and dead flesh , of toenails and hair . It 's what floats his boat , gets him off . - He 's a sick man . - Sick would describe him . We found women 's fingers in his freezer . He liked to eat them with his peas and carrots . - So it 's just women he 's after . - Just women . Been five years in here thinkin about only that . I 'm sure he 's worked up quite an appetite . I happen to know you two agents have a particular forte , a thing for ... what is it called ... the supernatural ? Now , the circumstances of the escape ... I promise you there is nothing supernatural about this man . Donny Faster is just plain evil . Case closed . You didn 't look at the file , did you ? A man escaped from prison . Not a man . Donny Faster . He didn 't just escape . He walked out . He walked out of a maximum security facility and no one seems to know how he did it . - Isn 't that why we 're here ? - That 's why I 'm here . I don 't know about you . Why are you here ? - Go home , Scully . - Mulder , this case doesn 't bother me . The man abducted you . Donny Faster did a number on your head like I 've never seen . And it 's okay to ... walk away . Mulder , that man does things to people that no one should ever have to think about . It 's not a question of if I should stay . I don 't have a choice . So let 's get to work . Well , this isn 't the first incident . Two prisoners have escaped from maximum security facilities ... in neighboring states over the past year . At 6 : 06 this morning , Donny Faster made it three . 6 : 06 ? And what 's so supernatural about that ? Dozens of witnesses , guards and staff and no one seems to remember anything . For a while they didn 't even know these guys were missing . - Have they been apprehended ? - Neither of the men have ever been seen again . I 'm a Christian , man . Then I know you 'll tell me the truth . Yeah . But I got no idea about Donny Faster ... or how he broke out . You and Donny Faster were in the garment shop at or about the time he disappeared . Well , it wasn 't just me . There was a lot of us in the shop . Yeah , but you had something happen . You had an incident . Yeah , something like that . You cried out to the guards that you 'd cut your hands . My fingers , man . I saw them all cut off . - Others saw them too . - No , but I felt them cut off . How do you explain that ? God works in mysterious ways , brother . - Glory . Amen . Glory . Amen . Glory . Amen . Posthypnotic suggestion . Did you see him ? You mean did I see him raise his foot ? Yes , I saw that . Programmed behavior prompted and manifested by suggestion . In this case , a rhythmic motion of the hands ... producing an unconscious act in a conscious state . It doesn 't work on you . - I know what hypnosis is , Mulder . - Group hypnosis . If you 're suggesting that Donny Faster escaped from prison ... using a technique from a Vegas lounge act , I 'd think again . Messmer was able to hypnotize and command entire audiences . So , how would Donny have acquired this amazing ability ? - I 'm not saying that it was Donny . - Well , then who ? Three inmates are missing from three separate prisons . One man has had possible contact with each of those cons . The prison chaplain . Glory . Amen . - Not God . The chaplain . Scully , what ? That song , can you hear that ? Barely . I haven 't heard that song since high school . That 's the second time I 've heard it in the hour . Well , I think if it was a make-out song , I think it 'd be ruined forever now , huh ? Oh , girl , don 't look any further Looking for something to eat ? Me ? How ' bout ... today 's special ? - You aren 't a narc , are you ? - No . - You 're looking at my hands . - You need a buff and polish . What are you , a freak ? I-I just got out of prison . Hey , missy , leave the customers alone ! Hey , missy , leave the customers alone ! I 'll do it for free . You just got out of prison and you wanna give me a manicure ? I 'll even do your cuticles . You receive the Lord 's grace , and this is your thanks . - What ? - Who do you think got you out of prison ? I don 't care . I 'm busy right now . The grace of God got you out . And it 's the only thing that will keep you out . - I thought you were kidding . - He 's chosen you , Donny . Later . - You called them on me . - No . Then do something . I have a car . - We aren 't going to make it to the car . - It 's within his power . Glory . Amen . - Glory . Amen . - Is he here ? - Well , uh ... We 're trying to determine that . Did you see him ? Well , that 's a good question . We thought we saw something , but apparently we didn 't . We got a call about a possible sighting of the suspect . - Something happened here , huh ? - Guy got hit by a car . Prison chaplain , it turns out . - A Reverend Orison . Paramedics took him to the hospital . He 's in pretty bad shape . Excuse me . Could you turn that up , please ? - Yeah . - What you need is a lover Someone to take over Oh , girl Don 't look any further And it 's strange When you think of the chances You 're lucky to be alive , Rev. Orison . - Who are you ? - Special Agent Dana Scully . Believe in the Lord , Agent Scully . He believes in you . That 's nice . But my partner and I are more concerned ... with several disappearances from maximum security facilities that seem to involve you . Don 't be concerned . God has them . What do you mean ? - Reverend ? - You 're a believer , aren 't you ? - This has nothing to do with me , sir . - Has everything to do with you . You have faith . Have had faith . You hear Him calling you , but you 're unsure of what to do . It 's not exactly a long shot , sir . You stand as you do now , neither here nor there , longing , but afraid , waiting for a sign . Well , the signs are everywhere . What happened to the inmates , sir ? Everything has a reason , Scout ... everything on God 's earth . Every moment of every day ... the devil waits for but an instant . As it is , it has always been , the devil 's instant is our eternity . The good reverend . How do you do ? Or maybe I should say , how do you do it ? His is the word . I am but the messenger who delivers it . - Well , this delivery arrived a little late . A little late and a little cold , as a matter of fact . I thought you 'd want to see it . What is this ? Blood of the lamb , Reverend . The handiwork of Mr. Donny Faster . - Ayoung girl he picked up at the bus stop . - Oh , Lord . Where is he , Reverend ? He took my car . She wasn 't supposed to die . No , Donny was supposed to die . You were supposed to kill him . That 's why you freed him . God knows you 're capable of it . Rev. Orison is really Robert Gailen Orison , convicted in 1959 of first degree murder . Served 22 years in Solidad . God spoke to me . He told me to look after Donny . When God spoke to you , Reverend , did He happen to mention where Donny was headed ? - Where are you going , Mulder ? - To prove that man 's a liar . How do you prove that somebody isn 't being directed by God ? You don 't believe that it happened ? God is a spectator , Scully . He just reads the box scores . - I don 't believe that . - You think God directs that man , directs him to kill ? Donny Faster isn 't dead and we don 't know the other inmates who escaped are dead either . So , what ? You think God directs him to ... let the prisoners out to kill ? No , but I believe that the reverend believes what 's he 's saying ... that it 's God working through him . Well , plenty of nut bags do . Has He ever spoken to you ? I 'm trying not to take offense . What did He say ? Mulder , I have heard that song three times now . That may not mean anything to you , but it means something to me . - What does it mean ? - I never thought about it before . It never meant anything to me until yesterday when it made me remember something . What ? When I was 13 , my father was stationed in San Diego . I was listening to the radio to that song ... when my mother came in and told me that my Sunday schoolteacher had been killed . - Mmm . - He 'd been murdered in his front yard . And that 's the first time I ever felt there was real evil in the world . Mulder , Rev. Orison called me " Scout . " That 's the same name my Sunday schoolteacher called me . Donny Faster escaped from prison at 6 : 06 a.m. That 's exactly the same time that I woke up yesterday morning when my power went out . So , what do you think that God is telling you ? Yeah , all right . Come with me , Scout . I 'll show you how the reverend talks to God . Police are involved in a four-state manhunt ... for a prisoner who escaped maximum security in Marion , Illinois . He was last seen driving a green 1970 ... Chevrolet Impala with a black landau top . He is described as six feet tall , medium build ... It 's a cerebral edema . A swelling of the brain . A trauma not uncommon with this kind of head injury or accident . Except this isn 't accidental . The cause , in fact , as it was stated to me , is self-inflicted . There 's a small hole here in the skull ... which allows oxygen into the brain cavity . The result of which is the Rev. Orison has three times the normal blood volume ... pumping through his brain . - And he did this himself ? - Yeah . My guess is he probably did it when he first got into prison ... when he first learned how to use its powers . - " Its powers " ? - There 's a theory ... that at this point in human evolution our mental capabilities ... are limited only by inadequate blood supply . In fact , centuries ago in the Peruvian Andes , holy men used to physically remove parts of their skull in order to increase blood volume , or drill small holes . So this hole in his head enables Rev. Orison to help these prisoners escape ? Yeah . The practitioners of this ... found that they could perform certain mental tricks . One of which they called " stopping the world . " Nobody can stop the world . I don 't care how many holes they have in their head . But maybe they can alter perception of it , creating a disparate version of reality which they can then project through hypnosis . But why ? I mean , even if you could , why ? Donny Faster is serving a life sentence without possibility of parole . That 's the final judgment as far as society is concerned , but not in the eyes of God ... or in the eyes of a man who thinks he 's God 's tool . Well , then if Rev. Orison meant to kill Donny Faster , then why is he still alive ? I don 't know . Maybe he unleashed something that he couldn 't control . Maybe he thought he was opening the door of perception , but then unwittingly he ... opened the gates of hell . What ? Glory . Amen . Glory . Amen . - Glory . Amen . Are you Donald ? Yes . I 'm from Tip Top Gentlemen Service . This isn 't your place , is it ? - No . Why ? - ' Cause I was coming up the stairs ... and got stopped by the landlord , like it 's any of his business . He told me some Rev. Orison lives here . - Now , you ain 't no preacher , are you ? - No . Good . They always like the weirdest things . You know what I mean ? - You okay ? - Yes . Something you wanna say ? Love your hair . What are you doin ' ? Is your hair chemically treated ? My hair ? I don 't know which product to use . Look , you 're not usin ' no product . I 'm clean , my hair 's clean . - If you 're gonna be that weird about it , I ought to just leave . - I 'm being a gentleman . Well , be a gentleman and get me a towel . I 'm gonna get out of here . It 's a wig . They lied to me . You lied to me ! - Where 'd he go ? - Marshal ? - Marshal ? - What ? The prisoner , the man you were guarding in this room , what happened to him ? He 's gone , Scully . So is the marshal 's gun . You didn 't see him ? Let 's go , Scully . - What is it ? - What does this mean ? - Did you tell him ? - No , I only told you . He must have , uh , overheard us when we were talking in the hallway . I didn 't mention the name of the song . - I 'm sure you did . - No , I 'm sure I didn 't , Mulder . Well , maybe this was meant for you . " Don 't look any further . " " Whosoever sheddeth man 's blood , by man shall his blood be shed . " What are you doing ? Taking you home . " The wicked will be punished . " Pray for God 's love , Donny . Find the humility in yourself to allow God into your heart . All you have to do is believe . Repent . You 'll feel God 's love come to show you the way to His heavenly kingdom . Are you sorry for what you 've done ? You ... What did you say ? Never ... No ... No ... - Why are you crying ? - I can 't ... Beg His forgiveness for what you did to those girls , for what you did to all those poor helpless girls . My violence is always waiting for an instant ... for when His back is turned . You can see it now . Are you crying for your sins ... or for yourself ? No , Reverend . I cry for you . Because you cannot kill me . You know , it 's funny . When all is said and done , there 's ... not much mystery in murder . And for that , I owe you an apology , Mulder . - What do you mean ? - Well , you were right . I was looking too hard for connections that weren 't there . Orison was a murderer , plain and simple . He liberated those prisoners so he could bring them out here and pass judgment on them . I guess in his own twisted way he was making good with his God . Glory . Amen . Let 's go home , Scully . Donny Faster placed the call to the police that led us out here . It 's almost like he 's begging us to hunt him down . This X-File is over . Lying dead there in a grave he dug himself . Let 's let the U.S. Marshals take over from here . Don 't look any further , Scully . - This is Fox Mulder . Leave a message after the ... - Agent Mulder , MarshalJoe Danno in Marion . I just talked to a call girl who I.D. ' d Donny Faster as an attacker . Claims Faster got real upset when she was wearing a red wig ... upset she wasn 't a redhead . This mean anything to you ? I 'd appreciate a call back . Go back to hell ! - Who does your nails , girly girl ? - Let me go ! The only reason why you 're alive is because I asked the judge for life ! The only reason why you 're alive is because we didn 't kill you when we could ! You 're the one that got away . - You 're all I think about . - I 'm a federal agent . You do anything to me and they will not give you a break this time . I 'm going to run you a bath . Don 't look any further Now , be good and don 't cause me any problems . Someone to count on In a world ever changing Here I am Stop where you 're standing What you need is a lover Someone to take over - Oh , girl , don 't look any further And it 's strange Oh , baby Don 't look any further Tonight We 're gonna take it All night long , baby , daylight Daylight I 'll still be lookin in your heavenly eyes And we 'll go on and on Don 't look any further Don 't look any further Someone to count on In a world ever changing Here I am , baby Stop right where you 're standing What you need is a lover Someone to take over Here I am , baby Don 't look any further Further - Excuse me . - Yeah , sure . If you want to pack some things , we can get out of here . - You can 't judge yourself . Maybe I don 't have to . The Bible allows for vengeance . But the law doesn 't . The way I see it , he didn 't give you a choice . And my report will reflect that , in case you 're worried . Donny Faster would have surely killed again if given the chance . He was evil , Mulder . I 'm sure about that without a doubt . But there 's one thing that I 'm not sure of . What 's that ? Who was at work in me ? Or what ? What made me ... What made me pull the trigger ? You mean if it was God ? I mean , what if it wasn 't ?

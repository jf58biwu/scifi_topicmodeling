[ FLAT BEEP ] Somehow , he has cobbled random brain waves into a working mind . - Like a carpet-remnant prom dress . - Like your prom dress .

No ! [ brain LAUGHS ] " Leela cried as Fry lay dead under the heavy bookcase . The Big Brain laughed in triumph . Then , for no reason , he left Earth forever . The End . " There ! Now he 's trapped in my book , full of plot holes and spelling errors . The Big Brain am winning again ! I am the " greetest " ! Now I am leaving Earth for no " raisin " ! [ cheering ] The Big Brain is defeated . Let what must be done , be done . Me ... feel...a bit better in cognitive faculties . I did it ! And it 's all thanks to the books at my local library . NlBBLER : And so , life returned to normal . Or as normal as it gets on this dirtball inhabited by psychotic apes . The people of Earth had no memory of what had transpired . Except Fry . And no one believed him or cared what he had to say . I returned to my post , ever-vigilant , lest Earth again come under attack . And when that day comes , God help us . God help us all . Time for a diapie change . NlBBLER : End transmission . Subtitles by flanger [ english SDH ]

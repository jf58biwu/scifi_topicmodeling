 Previously on Farscape . Distillate of Laka . One whiff and the pain is gone . She says they help you forget Aeryn . When I double the dose . What do you desire with wormholes ? For starters ? Go home . ( yelling ) That 's Earth . Your place of origin is where you can do the most damage . Crichton 's DNA which I provided for you will enable you to detect his presence . So when he returns , as we know he will , capture him alive . D 'Argo : Pilot , I 've got Crichton . We 're coming aboard . Welcome home , son . We 've been waiting for you a long time . What 's the matter , John ? Was it a bass or a trout ? And now , on Farscape . They 're not impostors . DRD scans confirm they are of your species . It 's me , son . It 's all right . You 're home . And you 're alive . And if that wasn 't miracle enough , this ship is actually a living organism ? Yeah , she is . And her . Another alien life-form . How 'd you get up here ? We sent a shuttle , to open up communications . Everyone at IASA had a coronary when she answered , finally . In English . She 's too smart . Holt : Commander Crichton . I am T.R. Holt , Special Advisor to the President . Congratulations . You have accomplished something truly momentous . Earth 's first contact with extraterrestrial life . ( chuckles ) Well , T.R. , today 's your lucky day . D 'Argo ! Aeryn ! Just don 't make any sudden moves . Good God . What delayed you ? Moya arrived 42 of their days ago . The wormhole 's unstable . Some time dilation may have occurred . Where the hell is Scorpius ? He 's in a pod , at the far end of this wormhole . He 's transmitting us a signal , so we can find our way back . Yeah , you can stop pimping for him anytime . What is wrong with you ? These are your people . Or do you think they pose us a threat ? No . It 's the other way around . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . Three years ago I got shot through a wormhole . I 'm in a distant part of the universe aboard this living ship of escaped prisoners , my friends . I 've made enemies . Powerful , dangerous . Now all I want is to find a way home to warn Earth . Look upward and share the wonders I 've seen . Earth . Terra firma . Seems forever it 's filled my thoughts , been my goal and now ... I 'm here . Family , friends ... seeing them again is so ... so normal . John , you 're alive . D.K. , when did that happen ? Two years ago . Married on a boat in Naples . I wish you could 've been there . You said he was a geek . He is a geek . - I won her over anyway . I figured Earth would freak out and it 's delivered in spades , on time , 30 minutes or less . Uncle Sam is keeping the aliens safe and contained . A waterfront mansion for their personal use and full security team standing by . It 's a cage . But at least it 's a gilded one . Good ? Of course , the suits are more interested in the technology . No surprise there . So we let ' em look . We don 't usually recommend this setting . They just can 't comprehend what they 're looking at , much less replicate it . Be careful . Not yet . So let ' em look . Some of the VIPs have accepted translator microbes . ( speaking Luxan ) ... under strict supervision . No power ups unless I ... But even translator microbes aren 't gonna help some people listen . Not that you can blame them . ( yells in Luxan ) At least the alien life 's not going too crazy . My family has been helping out . Would you like me to bring you some of my clothes ? My sister Olivia , she 's hanging with ' em . - Sure . Thanks . And my cousin Bobby . Bobby is totally fascinated by the E.T.s. Hey . I got this great idea . How about ... how about we break out of here , and go make some new friends . Chiana , you know the humans will not let us out unescorted . And the way you make friends , I do not blame them . Rygel , have you tried this ? Sparky and Wrinkles ? - Another delicacy . They 're the happiest of the crew . They 're in gastro heaven . What 's it called ? It 's called cop-porn . But T.R. Holt , he is not happy . What 's the big deal ? It 's a simple proposal . A trip on a spaceship for 500 of Earth 's best and brightest . Yeah , but who picks the 500 , you ? Me ? No , no , no . Let UNESCO handle that , or the Nobel committee . Be much simpler to keep it local . Local meaning only red-blooded Americans . No deal . No cookie . Some would disagree . Quote , " The Farscape project was and is an American initiative . I do not think it is unfair that America should reap the first benefits of it . " Yeah , what big-hearted patriot said that ? A former astronaut by the name of Jack Crichton . Did you know we 're making him IASA 's Project Director for Extraterrestrial Studies ? Father and son . Dynamite P.R. Jack is just so happy to be making a contribution . Don 't screw it up for him . That 's a nice suit . Do you have to buy that or does it come standard issue ? Which brings us to Dad . Dad ... Jack : All right , time for lighting test . T minus ... Dad 's world is upside down . So he 's trying to make it right side up by putting up Christmas decorations . Great . - Might need a little more ... Christmas decorations even though it 's Florida and the whole block is cordoned off with security . Please , back , sir . Family traditions . They 're supposed to bring us together , and to make everything normal . So , you do this every cycle ? Year . Every year . - Year . Year . Christmas has always been our favorite holiday . We never get tired of it . I love that Christmas where you lit the fire in the fireplace and the smoke came back down because Mr. Jingles was in the flue ! Oh , come on . One little mistake , you 're gonna hold it against me . How was I suppose to know he was up there ? - The cat didn 't have hair for three months , Dad . What the frell is that ? - Remember we gave you riding lessons , honey ? Thought you were gonna cry . - I did cry . A cat ? - Yeah , it 's a pet . Hey , and this . - Does he talk ? Baby , remember this that your brother made ? ( laughs ) : Yeah . Show him . Remember this , John ? Made this when you were five years old . Your mother loved it . Crichton : So what 's next , we break out the bare-ass baby pictures ? Hey , that 's not a bad idea . Let me get the photo album . - Yeah , let 's take a vote . Aeryn ? Of course . - No , we 're not gonna ... your not looking at my bare ass . Why not ? I 've seen it all ready . - Yes , we are . ( door chimes ) Excuse me , I hear the door . I got it . Jack : Here , let me , ah , let me show you this . Special delivery from the ghost of Christmas past . Caroline . Welcome back to terra firma . Hey , um ... Caroline 's here . Come on in . But things have changed . Jack : Hi , Caroline . Come on in . - Hey , Jack . We don 't get to close our eyes and pretend they haven 't . And everyone is telling me how different I am . They 're right . But they don 't have a clue why . They can 't know what I 've seen , what I 've done , what 's been done to me . They can 't know what 's out there waiting for them and I can 't tell them because they wouldn 't believe me . Hell , if I tried , they 'd lock me up . Frell , I 'd lock me up . Hey , Buck Rogers . You 're supposed to be fishing not writing memoirs . What 's that ? It 's homework . This was supposed to be a weekend off . No homework , no stress , no aliens , no demands . I guess I 'm not doing my job . Man on TV : Mankind has always seen himself as the center of the universe . To discover that 's no longer true is highly traumatic . A fundamental status quo is being threatened here . The very existence of Homo sapiens may be under threat . It 's hardly surprising the hysteria is rising . - Here . Interviewer : Hysteria ? In what sense ? The presence of these alien has induced various forms of societal hysteria . - No , thanks . Holt says it 's bad on the political front . Every nation 's demanding equal access to the aliens and all the information we get from them . Of course they are . We 're gonna give it to them . I don 't see why . Why should we give them access to technology they can use against us ? 'Cause it 's the right thing to do . Wouldn 't worry about it , Dad . Subcommittee 'll tie it up for years and load it down with a ton of guidelines . Now you 're being naive , son . The best and safest thing to do is keep it to ourselves . Space travel was your dream to unite mankind . When did that change ? September the eleventh . This isn 't the same world you left four years ago , son . People don 't dream like they used to . It 's about survival now . Who 's survival ? Olivia 's survival . And Susan and Frank and Bobby 's . Imagine them blown up by a suicide bomb , or coughing up blood from a poison gas attack . This country is under siege . You just don 't understand the global situation . I don 't understand because I 've been out of town , or because Daddy knows best ? Oh , come on . Now that 's not fair , son . If you wanna argue with Holt or even the President , I can arrange that . No , I don 't wanna argue with anybody . No , you don 't wanna argue . You just wanna be obstinate and insist everyone agree with you . Are you accusing me of being the only one in this family to be stubborn ? No . You 're the most stubborn . That I would argue with . - All right , let 's split the title . I 'm going into space tomorrow . If you 'd like to come along you 're welcome . Unless you 're too stubborn . ( growling ) Awesome ! Yeah , and this is just the garage . Come on , show me more . No , I got some stuff I gotta do first . 1812 ! I 've give him the tour , son . I know my way around . No , Jack , it 's a big ship . You 're gonna need a Sherpa . Give me that arm . This should fix it up . It 's a miracle . 1812 , this is Bobby . Bobby , this is 1812 . 1812 is gonna be your tour guide . Don 't let ' em break anything . I won 't break anything . Where 's that Pilot you told me about ? I 'll show you . You won 't believe it . Jack ... that way . Think they know how to open doors ? D 'Argo : Can you check wormhole stability from Command , or do you need to go outside again ? No , Command will be fine . I 've had enough EVA to last a lifetime . Apparently all systems check out normal with the Prowler so the scientists don 't seem to have caused any damage . I made sure they didn 't . I appreciate it . Thank you . Okay ... Meet you on Command . Thank you . Aeryn , listen up . You got a problem with them poking around at your Prowler , why don 't you leave it here ? The IASA boys got enough to look at with D 'Argo 's guppy and my module . Would it be better if I stayed here as well ? Why would you wanna do that ? I 'm clearly not fitting in . You 're fitting in as well as any of us are . Whatever . It 's ... it 's up to you . It 's up to me ? - Yeah . Yeah , it 's up to you . Fine . I ... Well , I don 't mind your scientists poking around with my Prowler . I can even field-strip a cannon if ... No , don 't do that . Thank you , but ... don 't do that . They 've seen enough . Crichton : You want a hand ? Aeryn : Nope . No . No , of course you don 't . ( low growl ) Braca : What is that ? An explanation would be pointless . You 'd retain no memory of it . ( gasps ) Skreeth , can you hear me ? It 's Grayza . Report . ( Skreeth 's voice ) : I hear you . Crichton is onboard Moya . According to reports , Moya now orbits Crichton 's home planet . Grayza : Where is this planet ? Unknown . We traveled through a wormhole to reach it . A wormhole ? - Yes . Are you certain ? - Yes . Do not seize Crichton yet . Learn all you can about his planet , its technology , its defenses and its location . Skeeth : Allowing me to interrogate Crichton will yield quicker answers . Crichton has already proven himself to be immune to several forms of interrogation . Stay hidden until we know more . Understood ? Understood . ( gasps ) We took a short break , for recreation . ( normal voice ) : I see . Don 't you remember , Captain ? Perhaps you will next time . But duty first . Run a full weapons systems check immediately . I want this ship ready to destroy a planet . Crichton : The readings match my homework . It 's gonna be at least 70 arns before the wormhole 's stable enough for Moya to get back through . Pilot says he and Moya are looking forward to giving humans their first trip to the stars . Yeah , right . They 're not going , are they ? No , we 'll be long gone while they 're still bickering over who gets the tickets . Well , then why offer them in the first place ? Gotta give ' em something , otherwise they 'll try and take it . Yeah , but we 're not giving them anything . Their scientists can 't even work out how to use Pulse Pistols . Doesn 't matter . My planet doesn 't have Chakan oil anyway . Don 't look at me like that . You know how paranoid my planet is . Yeah , they ... they don 't like aliens . They don 't like anybody . Well , I 'm glad to see you taking a positive approach . Cooperation , teamwork , distraction . We give them a few hints then we get the hell out of Dodge and hope they get their act together before the real space monsters show up . Aeryn ? Have you seen John ? Pilot says he 's ready to head back down . So am I. Would you like a lift in my Prowler ? Go for it , Jack . She 's the best pilot I 've ever seen . Think you can manage a side trip to the moon ? I think I can do better than that . ( engine roaring ) Jack ( chuckling ) : Saturn . I 'm really looking at Saturn . I 'm farther from Earth than any human 's ever been . Actually , no . ( chuckling ) : Oh yeah . I guess my son does have a few miles on me . He must be happy to be back on Earth , though . I don 't know . He 's having a tough time readjusting . He , uh ... he doesn 't talk much about what he 's been through . Not even about his shipmates ? Oh , he-he ... he 's talked about your societies , customs . Remarkable stuff . He thinks that your species and mine might somehow be linked . Our geneticists are still looking at that . But I wouldn 't be surprised . If I didn 't know better , I 'd think you were human . I 'm not . Do you wish you were ? Why do you ask ? You have feelings for John , don 't you ? Does that shock you ? No . I suppose it might if I thought of you as an alien life-form , but I don 't . John has not said anything to me , but I believe he has feelings for you , too . He did . Now ... Now he 's home . That 's one of the things he 's gonna to have to sort out . Just give him time . Hmm . ( engine roaring ) Sikozu : Biologic examination ? I said no , and I don 't care how many of the others have consented . You can go stick your probes in one of them . I 'm not interested . Chiana : Well , you never know . You might like it . No , I will not have an x-ray . I don 't care how much it advances mankind 's xenobiological knowledge . N ... Leave ! Rygel : Eat something . You 'll feel better . I do not want to eat . I want to go back to Moya . Good . Here ... here , give this to Pilot . Noranti : ( with music ) : Hark ! The hee rawld angles seen guh Glowry to the nude bored keen guh - Chiana : nude ... Peach on Erp and murky mill ed Gode and signers reek n sill ed ... - Chiana : murky ... sill ed ... It was incredible . We flew through the Cassini division , beat the Cassini space probe by a year . Told Aeryn it was the best Christmas present I 'd ever gotten , except for that tie rack you made me in junior high school . Speaking of suits and ties , Holt is still fighting me on the tech-sharing plan and the explorer selection process . I could use a little support . I 've always supported you as much as I could , son . You 're not looking at the bigger picture here . You don 't see the big picture . You can 't conceive of it . Earth has to work together on this . Yeah . Well , you 're asking the impossible on that one . Impossible . " Impossible is not in our vocabulary . " Who said that ? You . You did . Four days before you set foot on the moon . You taught me to believe that . That belief kept me alive . Please tell me you still believe it . I 'm not sure what I believe anymore . All this crap you 've tacked on . Hetch drive . FTL . It can 't work . - It 's theoretically impossible . Theory is wrong . Newton , Einstein , Hawking . We prove them wrong every time we pop out for groceries . Then tell us how it works . I didn 't design it , D.K. I just installed it . That 's for you to figure out . Sure , drop it in our laps . Let us scratch our heads and look stupid while you go on Nightline or have lunch with the president . Laura : We need some help . We 're Neanderthals trying to understand 747s . These new laptops are really nice . Laura , I cannot tell you what I don 't know . Then why 'd you bring us these ships ? If we 're never gonna learn anything , why rub our noses in how dumb we are ? You 're not dumb . - Neither are you . Taka says you asked for the metallurgic analysis of these ships . You 're on the track of something . It 's just a riddle . Why do Prowler pilots turn to goo ? Get back to me on that . I 'm gonna get a refill of coffee . You guys want some ? ( sighs ) ( low breathing ) I think something 's going on . I 'm sure John is holding out on us . Probably trying to grab more of the glory for himself . Again . He doesn 't care about it . The only thing John ... ( hissing ) ( screaming ) ( gunshots ) ( screaming ) Laura ! No ! ( both screaming ) ( roaring hiss ) ( screaming ) Are you sure that they 're telling you the truth ? ( Skeeth 's voice ) : I can guarantee it . Plainly , not all humans have Crichton 's alleged ability to resist interrogation . Grayza : Then Crichton has given no wormhole information to Earth yet . No . That knowledge can die with Crichton . Not until I have that knowledge . I 'm confident I can capture him . But doubt I can bring him to you . Nor can I yet come to you . Wherever this Earth is the journey there is obviously impractical without wormhole travel . And only Crichton can command that . Then our best alternative is to seize him , learn what we can from him , then execute him . I 'm forced to agree . Anything more you need from my captives ? No . ( roaring ) Hey , where you been ? Shopping with aliens . They closed off the whole mall and the store owners , I 'm sure , were very annoyed . I 'm sure they love it . It 'll be in their ads tomorrow . Not to mention something to tell their grandkids . What are you doing ? Mmm , nothing . What 's wrong ? Nothing . Do you wanna go live in the past ? No , thank you . I have been there . Well , where do you wanna live ? I don 't know . You tell me . Where do I belong ? Well , do you miss this life ? I look at these pictures , and I recognize the faces . Some of the places . But it 's not my life . I miss her . I miss that chick . ( both laugh ) I miss him , but I can 't ... He 's changed . What , he 's changed so much that you can 't talk to him ? You know , he says exactly the same thing about you . " He 's changed so much and ... " I have changed , and I can 't tell him why . Why not ? Because he is the Director for Extraterrestrial Studies , and what he hears , the government hears . Are you saying he can 't keep a confidence ? Coming here was a mistake . It was an accident , and it shouldn 't have happened . And there were things that the government cannot hear . What , is it bad ? No . No , it 's not bad . ( in an E.T. voice ) Don 't worry . It 'll be okay . Okay . - Trust me . ( both laugh ) D 'Argo : So , I see we 've been shopping again . Aeryn : Yes . Crichton isn 't here , is he ? No , but his cousin is . He 's outside interviewing Caroline Wallace . Really ? - Mmm . Thanks , Chi . Can you help with this ? - Move . What 'd you do , buy the whole planet ? It 's not mine . It 's from Aeryn . I don 't know what it is , but I ... I know it 's for Crichton . It won 't get him back . He hasn 't forgiven her . Oh , he will . Sooner or later . Some males can actually forgive . Ooh , sorry . So , how long have you known John Crichton ? I met him six years ago . And how long have you been his girlfriend ? Bobby , cut . Take five . Don 't stop . I 'm interested in the answer . Wanna tell me why you wanna know ? That 's fair . John and I were in a relationship . What kind of relationship ? It was complicated . Yeah , I can imagine . Well , actually , no , I can 't imagine . John and I had a much simpler one . No strings , no plans , just good , casual times . Well , at least that 's how it was before . And now ? Uh , he doesn 't even want that much . But he 's been spending time with you . I think he 's been testing himself . Working out what he really wants . It 's not me . I 'm sorry . No , you 're not . You still want him , don 't you ? Yes . But it doesn 't matter . He doesn 't want me , either . I think he does . When I asked him about you , he said there was nothing going on . He said that several times . That 's bad . You have a lot to understand about humans . Sometimes when we repeat a lie , it means that we 're trying to convince ourselves of the truth . And that is that he still loves you . Very much . Scorpius : Your head is bruised . How difficult was your travel here ? Extremely turbulent , but not very damaging . Following your guidance signal was a great help . What are you doing ? Cross-coupling the fuel cells . To turn this pod into a bomb . This wormhole is traversable . It leads to Crichton . Therefore , I cannot have Grayza find it . You think her Command Carrier will return ? My spy aboard the Carrier has been unable to discern her current strategies . But should she return , as a last resort , I will detonate this Pod within the mouth of the wormhole . That should destabilize it . But how will you survive ? I wouldn 't survive it . You would have a better chance of destabilization with ... two Pods ? Would you like to observe the sequence ? I just spoke to Pilot . Sikozu went back through the wormhole . She did what ? She met up with Scorpius . That son of a bitch . The wormhole must be stabilizing . She better not bring that bastard back through . No , she says she 's not gonna return to Earth . Good . No Comms . There should be no signals that link back to us . Holt : I will inform the President . Now , I am getting major flak from the Hill about John 's global initiatives . He 's gotta bend a little . I don 't think he will . Make him . It 's your job . The Joint Chiefs are up in arms . They wanna classify the alien technology as a national security risk and impound it . John won 't permit that . He 'll take these ships out of here first . Look , I know you share my concerns about John 's plans . All I 'm asking for is a little compromise . Is that unreasonable ? Chiana : Crichton , this isn 't a very fun party . It 's not supposed to be a party . It 's a photo op for VIPs . Smile . Can 't we find a real party somewhere ? Could I have everybody 's attention ? Well , here comes the " My fellow Americans " . I once told my son that he 'd ... he 'd get the chance to become his own kind of hero . Well , he got it . And he made the most of it . I also taught him to stick to his guns when he thought he was right . So I can 't fault him when he does . I 've heard it said that he should accept our judgment over his , because he owes us . I 've even said it myself . But we 're wrong . Look at the friends he discovered . The miracles he brought . Then ask yourself what he owes us , as compared to what we owe him . Now , John insists that we share these wonders with the rest of the world . But some people are afraid of what 'll happen if we do . John 's afraid of what 'll happen if we don 't . And I 'll go with that . So , as IASA 's Project Director for Extraterrestrial Studies , I hereby invite all nations to participate in the ongoing Farscape mission . What made you change your mind ? Because I believe in you . That means a lot . There 's a few things we should talk about . Son , it 's Christmas Eve . Right . It 'll keep . I know you 're preparing for a private dinner , so I won 't stay long . Is he ... is John here yet ? Um , no , not yet . I ... I wanted to bring you back the clothes you lent me . They didn 't suit you , huh ? Oh , no , it 's not that . It 's just I 'm more comfortable in these . It 's what I am , I guess . And I brought the books as well . I really appreciate it . Everything . Are you leaving ? Possibly . Well , you 'll be here tomorrow morning to open presents with the rest of us , won 't you ? I may not . What 's happened ? Nothing bad . It 's not bad . It 's just that I may be needed on Moya ... ( kitchen timer beeping ) ... on Moya for a while . It 's all right . I 'll be right back . So ... are you as bored as I am ? I 'm sorry , Senator , she 's , uh , still learning our customs . Spank you very much . Maybe you can teach me . - Okay , Chiana , let 's leave . Come on . - What 's wrong with you guys ? What , you all scared of us still ? - Uh-uh . Don 't you know that all humans are bigots ? They fight even amongst their own species . Well , they do seem to fight a lot amongst themselves . Hey , maybe ... maybe that 's why they barely left their own planet . ( sniffing ) What ? Something smells bad . Well , it 's not me . ( chuckles ) Frell . Since you escorted us all the way to the living room , I insist that you stay for a cup of eggnog . - Thank you , sir . Hi , Aeryn . - Hello . Jack : Livvy ? Olivia : In here . I 'm sorry , I just had to drop some things off to Olivia . No , it 's all right . ( talking in background ) Do you want me to go back to Moya ? We 've already talked about this . It 's entirely up to you . Fine . I 'll go with what you prefer . Look , I 'm not trying to pressure you , John . I 'm actually trying to take the pressure off . Would you be happier if I wasn 't here on Earth ? You don 't have to justify it or explain it . Just give me an honest yes or no . Jack : Aeryn ? Would you join us for dinner ? Oh , no , I couldn 't impose . There 's always room for one more . It 's a traditional family thing . We 'll start a new tradition . Look , it 's up to you , but we 'd love to have you . Could I get some eggnog , please ? Mm-hmm . ( screams ) ( groans ) Livvy ! ( gunshots ) ( growls ) ( yells ) ( gasps ) Whoa ! ( sighs ) ( growling ) Suck on this . - What is that ? Oh , forget about it . Get Winona . Right . ( growls ) I ... I 've got Crichton . Yes ? ( screeches ) ( screeching ) ( Crichton yells ) ( Crichton coughing ) ( screeches ) John , clear ! ( screams ) ( gasping ) ( gasping weakly ) Dad ! Livvy ! Olivia ? You all right , old man ? Yeah . - Olivia , you all right ? What the hell was that ? No idea . ( loud rumbling ) ( screaming ) Get down ! What is it ? Tell me what 's wrong . ( soft moans ) Well . Merry frelling Christmas . Amen . Ma 'am ! Captain , that was the best ever . You continue to amaze me . I 'm glad I could be of service . I mean , I 'm pleased I could satisfy you . Will that be all ? Yes . For now . ( sighs ) Uh , all the food goes to my chamber . Well what are we doing with Crichton 's gifts ? You wanna put ' em in his quarters ? Not the right time . Cargo Bay for now . We 'll leave as soon as Crichton 's aboard . Here , I 'll give you a hand . Thank you . Noranti . What 's this ? Well , I think you made it . It 's for Crichton . What does it do ? What does it do ? It 's to help him move on . Surmount his feelings and forget . Who ? Olivia : I was gonna give you this on Christmas . This is Mom 's . She left this to you . I want you to have it . Mom 'd love that . ( jet flying overhead ) Don 't go . I have to go . You take care . ( sniffling ) Stay . Look , we 'll guard the wormhole . We 'll ... we 'll set up a defense shield . Nothing 'll get through . No , I have a job to do . That 's your words again . ( voice breaking ) : I don 't wanna lose you , son . I can 't shake this feeling that you 're not coming back . Oh , I 'll be back . That 's a promise . You take care of my home . That 's a promise . Jack : Take care of yourself .

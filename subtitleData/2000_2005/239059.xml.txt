[ All Shouting ] - Guys , guys , please , please ! This is very risky stuff here , and I 'm a highly-trained professional astronaut . Now , Uncle Phil will launch another rocketjust as soon as he completes his fuel intake . - Thanks , darlin ' . - [ Shouting Continues ] Now , you know , it takes six months just to reach Mars . Then a year on the surface , six months back . That 's , like , two years , you know ? Anyway , I guess what I 'm trying to say here is that , um , you know , this being my last night on Earth and everything , this could be a very precious memory for me . [ Chuckling ] Nice try . William , get that thing out of your nose . Don 't you talk back to Mommy . - Hey , Woody . - Yeah ? Our Mars One crew won 't be heading back to Earth ... till ten days after you guys land at our base camp with Mars Two . thank you , Renee . That 's a pretty long rendezvous , don 'tyou think ? What are you suggesting , Sergei ? - I think maybe you should bring a baseball bat . - [ Chuckling ] We will play American baseball on Mars . Our two crews . - Oh , please . - We could have ourselves a Solar System Series . - Half you guys are foreigners . We 'd crush you . - No , no , no . Because we have equal crews . We have three men , one woman , same handicap . Easy now . That 's my wife you 're talking about . Terri just happens to be one hell of a shortstop . Fast-pitch , no steals , batter calls his own strikes . - Thousand bucks make it interesting ? - Winner take all . Good . You bring the balls . The best thing about our mission- - On Mars Two , technically I outrank her . So for the fi rst time in our marriage , she 's gonna have to do everything I say , right ? - Yes , honey . - " Yes , honey , sir , " with a little salute helps . - Yes , honey , sir . - Yeah . I like it . It 's good . - Take that corn up there , all right ? - Yes , sir . [ Woman ] I 'm notsure howlfeel aboutNASA allowing couples ... to go on this type of mission together . Nothin ' personal , Terri . I mean- - [ Chuckling ] It 's just that it 's a funny feeling for those ofus staying behind . Yes , but all the research shows that marriage will provide stability ... on these long-duration trips . - Then they haven 't studied some of the couples I 've known . - [ Women Chuckling ] Luke . Come on , baby . He 's not coming . This isn 't right . I mean , Jim deserves this too . All of his friends are here . - I know . - It 's my last night here . Hey ! It 's your last night with us too . - I know . I 'm sorry , baby . - Mm-hmm . - [ Chuckles ] - I love you , Deb . I love you too . Maybe you should spend some time with Bobby . - Yeah , where is he ? - Up in his fort . Oh . Okay . [ Man ] Millions of miles away . Deep space . So lonesome , so cold . So lame , Nick . [ Chuckling ] Knock , knock . Bobby ? Your friends are out there playing . What are you doing up here ? Who 's gonna read to me now at bed time ? Your mother will . But ... I like when you do it . - Now we 're never gonna finish our book . - Bobby . Listen , I 've been thinking about that too , okay ? And what I figured out was- - How about if I bring along my own copy ? Then , every night , wherever I am , I 'll read a little bit more ofit . And you and Mommy can read a little bit more of it wherever you are . It 'll be kind oflike we 're reading it together . ' Cause I don 't know aboutyou , but I 'm kind of anxious to find out how old Ben Gunn got marooned on that island . You think that 's a good idea ? - Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . - Yeah ? Yeah ? Okay . [ Dog Barking ] [ VehicleApproaching ] Well , we were afraid you wouldn 't come . [ Chuckles ] I caught a whiff of your barbecue . Uh-huh . - After that , - Yeah ? I was , uh , helpless . Tsk . All the way out in Galveston ? - Something like that . - Mmm . It 's his night , Deb . I didn 't want to spoil it . " Spoil it " ? He has been going crazy looking for you . - Don 't ever do that to me again . - [ Both Chuckle ] - How ya doin ' ? - Hey , I 'm doin ' good . - Here . - Thanks , man . - A lot of people are gonna be glad to see you , you know that ? - Yeah . Come on . Let 's go in . You remember him ? - Just let that go . - As soon as you admit that it was a no-go situation . - It was a go situation . - Three months , no data stream , - you 're gonna land the ship ? - Just ' cause you keep bringing it up doesn 't make you right . - Just because you get loud doesn 't make- - Jim , settle it . - No , don 't- - - Just because you get loud doesn 't make- - Jim , settle it . - No , don 't- - - Settle it . - Don 't look at me . - It was a go situation . - This is exactly what I 'm talking about . - It 's hard to admit , I know that . Three commanders , one ship . I don 't think that 's gonna work . There 's not enough rocket fuel in the world to get those egos off the ground . Come on . Ah , we would 've made a great crew . Maybe . If this man was left seat . - Yeah . - [ Chuckling ] Guys , come on . I 'm a pretty good stickjockey . Call me if you want a flight test . - What is a stickjockey ? - " l 'm a pretty good stickjockey . " Come on , Mr. Cover of Time Magazine . - The guy who landed the crippled Block Il shuttle . - Yeah . - That 's the stickjockey . - The stickjockey did that . [ Chuckling ] - Yeah , Mr. StickJockey . - Okay , I made a little noise , but putting the first footprints on Mars ? That 's for guys who wrote their Ph.D. thesis on how to colonize the place ... and for guys who read too much science fiction as a kid ... and still wear these little Flash Gordon rocket ships around their necks . - Very mature . - You read every damn science fiction book I did , and you 'rejust not man enough to wear jewellery , that 's all there is to that . - Yeah . - You knowyou want Flashy . Ain 't gettin ' him ! [ Shouts ] Maggie would have loved to see you two clowns just one more time . [ Sobbing Quietly ] I 'm gonna go and get a beer . I don 't know , Woodrow . I think it 's about time you donated this baby to the museum . - Internal combustion , boys . Accept no substitutes . - [ Engine Revs ] Jim , listen . If there 's , um- - If there 's anything Terri and I can do , you call us , all right ? - I 'm okay . Really . Thanks . - All right . Luke . - Yeah ? - I 'll see you when I get to Mars . Listen , don 't solve all the mysteries of the universe . - Leave a little something for the next guys . - I 'm not promising anything . - Just bring some expensive beer . - All right . Will do . Godspeed . Thanks , buddy . - [ Tires Screech ] - [ Dog Barking ] It should 've been your mission , Jim . Yours and Maggie 's . Nobody ever wanted Mars the way you two did , not even Woody . You two were 1 2 years training for this thing , hoping for this assignment . Well , that 's- - that 's all over now . If Maggie hadn 't gotten sick , if you hadn 't pulled yourself ... - out of the rotation to take care ofher , you- - - Luke- - No , Jim . Wait a minute . I wanna say this . Look , I wanted this assignment , all right ? But not like this , Jim . I would give all of this up in a second ifit would bring Maggie back to us . I know that . Look , all the years of training and planning for this mission have been a privilege . Mars is yours now . Go get it . I will . You take care of yourself , Jim . You too , buddy . Okay . I 'll see you when I get back . Hey , Luke . Have a great ride . [ Chuckles ] I always do . [ Beeping , Whirring ] [ Beeping , Whirring ] [ Wind howling ] - [ Woman OverRadio ] Luke , youreadme ? - Here , Renee . Luke , ljustgot aRES-8 on-line , and- - Well , we thinkyou 're gonna want tosee this for yourself . Okay , copy that . - Now , is this the cinder cone ? - No , it 's too smooth . - It 's too angular . Volcanic upwelling , maybe . - No . No fissure , no caldera . No , it 's an upwelling for sure , but maybe not volcanic . Look at the color and how shiny it is . That almost looks like- - - It looks like ice . - [ Both Scoffi ng ] - This far south ? - Impossible . You can 't have ice at this latitude . I mean , not unless there 's , like , a- - Okay , how far away is that ? Sixteen kilometers , northeast . Take us 20 minutes to get there , chief . We 're gonna send a packet to Micker . We 're going out there . - Keep working . - Okay . - Careful . Watch your step . - [ Chattering ] - Is it possible to take picture ? - Oh , picture . - Here we go . - Let 's have a picture . Say , " Cheese . " [ Luke OverMonitor ] This is a trulyanomalous formation . It 's unlikeanything everseenso far . The structure appears to be crystalline , atleastfrom theangle that 's displayedbyARES-8 . [ Static ] We 're trying not to go too nuts up here , but we think there 's a good chance ... that this could bean extrusion from some subsurface geothermal column of water . And , of course , if that 's correct , then we may have found the key to permanent human colonization . - We thinkit wise to suspend judgement- - - Let geology and hydrology ... know we need to scramble on this- - full court press . So we 're gonnaheadout thereASAP and takealookat this thing , tr yand getanidea ofits composition . By the time you receive this , we should just about be on site . [ Machinery Whirring ] [ Low , DistortedBeeping ] [ DistortedBeeping Continues ] Anybody else hearing that ? [ Renee ] Yeah . Whatis it ? Idon 't know . Itsounds like interference from therover . - Can you fix it ? - Hey , skip , I can fix anything . - [ Chuckles ] - Love that modesty . [ DistortedBeeping Continues ] Break out theradar . Let 's see what this thing 's made of . [ Luke OverMonitor ] Oh , there 's onemore thing . This is a very important , very special day fora good friend of ours back home . We knowhe 's there right now . He hates it when anybody makes any kind of a fuss abouthim , so I 'm not gonna mention his name . Because the last thing I would want to do would be ... to embarrass someone likeJim McConnell ! Was that loud ? Oh , well . It 's done now . It can 't be right . It says there 's metal under there . - Solidmetal . - No , that doesn 't make any sense . - You 're reading a vein ofore , Renee . - No , it- - It says it 's under the whole mountain . [ LukeSighs ] All right . Move it closer , up the power , and we 're gonna try it again . - Hey . - [ All ] * * Happy birthday to you * * - * * Happy birthday to you * * - Okay , everybody . - I want you to take a look atJim . - * * * * * * [ Singing Continues ] Is heallredwith one of those fake " Oh , I 'm-a-good-sport " grins onhis face ? That 's right . Now , everybody , take a look at Ray . Does he have one of those ... " This-wasn 't-in-my-mission-plan " looks on his face ? Uh-huh . I thought so . There 's nothing you can do about it , Ray . - We 're ahundredmillionmiles away ! - [ Crew Taunting ] Okay , let 's blow it out . - We 're all set here , chief . - Let 's crank up thejuice , see what 's in this sucker . [ DistortedBeeping Continues ] What happened ? [ Wind gusting ] Oh , my God ! - Are you getting that , Sergei ? - Uh-huh . [ Screeching Sound ] - [ Roaring Sound ] - [ Cries Out ] Oh , my God ! Renee ! [ ManShouts ] Oh . Oh , my God . Oh , Jesus . Oh , Jesus . [ Both Shouting ] [ Grunting ] [ Shouting ] Ahhh ! [ Shouting ] [ Screaming ] [ Woody ] Problem .. hatch door malfunction , backup power fail , manual override fail . - Solution ? - [ Terri ] Replace optical relay . Piece of cake . God , who dreams up these nightmares ? - Don 't try to change the subject . - I 'm not . - We 're talking about your sister 's wedding . - No , we 're talking about ... dancing lessons before my sister 's wedding . Do you mind ? I 'm in the middle of a catastrophic power failure here . Check . - [ Chuckles ] Not effective . - Not effective ? - Replace optical relay . - You 're distracting me . We 're a married couple . Would it kill you to invite me ... out on the dance floor just once in a while ? - We danced at our wedding . - No , that 's not dancing . That 's you shuffling your feet around while you grab my butt . I 'm talking about real dancing , you know ? Cha-cha-cha , rhumba , jitterbug . Darling , face it . Some couples dance , some go to Mars . - [ Chuckling ] - That 's life . - Test . - Effective . I 'm serious . As soon as we get back home , we 're starting lessons . Woody , if we never dance , people are gonna think there 's something wrong . If they see me dance , they 'll know there 's something wrong . This is highly unprofessional . " This is highly unprofessional , sir . " You keep forgetting that " sir . " [ Phil Over Radio ] Cockpit , this is Control . - Cockpit , this is Control . - Control , this is Cockpit . - [ Alarm Blaring ] - Terri , it 's Phil . They want us all to report to Micker ASAP . - Who says to report to Micker ? - The little men who live in my head . That 's a negative . We 're in the middle of a catastrophic power failure right now . Yeah , Woody , it was Ray Beck . He told me to round up the team , now . The exact same moment we lost the data stream , they picked up this intense burst of energy from Mars . - What do you mean " intense " ? - Catastrophic . What about the crew ? The level ofenergy in the pulse ... didn 't seem survivable . How about the REMO ? It went into Mars ' orbit last week . Maybe it could give us some clue . That 's just what we tried next . Right . The , uh , resupply module checked out fine . No instrument failures . Orbit holding steady . But there was something else . The REMO 's computer contained an uplink message- - a very faint , highly-distorted transmission from Mars One base camp . - Someone 's alive . - Yes , yes , yes . Put up the message . Still concentrating on the audio , but we 've got a long way to go . Show us whatever you 've got . Show us . I have to make this- - make this fast . [ Panting ] I may not get another chance to- - [ Static interference ] tomake--another chance- - chance- - to thesite--site . There was a low sound that- - [ Static Continues ] [ Signal Breaking Up ] alow sound--sound--alow sound- - Something came out of the top of the mountain , and it hit us . And ... it hit us- - it hit us- - Oh , my God ! [ Crying ] They 're dead . God . Nick- - Man ! Dead . - [ Static Stops ] - [ Ray ] That 's it . I don 't know . Luke must be in pretty bad shape ... if he hasn 't just blasted out of there in the Earth Return Vehicle . That thing 's designed so even one crew member can fly it back to Earth . Even if Luke was in great shape , he couldn 't get home . An energy pulse of that magnitude would have fried the E.R.V 's computers . Other than the computers , how do we think the E.R.V. fared ? So far , our modelling says it should be in pretty good shape . Which means it 's gonna be up to us to get new motherboards , drives and sof tware to Mars as fast as we can . - Right . - Slow down , slow down , slow down . - It 's gonna take us weeks just to analyze this data . - Right . But in the meantime , we 've gotta be working up a mission plan . - Luke needs us now . - Luke may already be dead . And even if he 's not , it 's doubtful he is going to be able to transmit again . So ... we wouldn 't know whether it 's safe to land ... until we were almost there . What about SIMA ? What about SIMA ? The Saturn imaging probe . It 's gonna slingshot around Mars on its way through the solar system . It could be retasked to take pictures , read radiation levels of Mars One base camp . Wait , wait , wait . We are getting ahead ofourselves . You 're forgetting the bigger problem . The orbits are all wrong . Our first decent launch window is almost eight months from now . Yes , but we can go earlier and get there faster ... ifwe reconfigure the payload for extra fuel . - We 've modelled that , Ray . I 've modelled it . - On paper , yes . But those stresses have never been tested in space . - The ship can take it . - Oh , " ship can take it . " I wasn 't thinking of just the ship . You 're right . I know the protocols for a Mars recovery mission better than anybody ... because I designed them . And I 'm telling you , these guys can do it . He 's right , Ray . We 've got a real shot here . Hmm . Well . Give me an updated mission plan by 0800 tomorrow . You 'll have it by 0600 . Let 's go to work . Chief , can I have a word ? Go ahead . - I no longer have the right crew . - What do you mean ? - Bjornstrom can be up here on the next shuttle . - Bjornstrom is a geologist . He 's good , but not for this . My people just lost eight months of training . This is a different mission with a different objective . - I haven 't approved the mission yet . - Yes , but whenyou do , it ought to be given its best chance for success . I want McConnell to fly right seat . Oh . Jim McConnell is no longer on mission status . - Yeah , because you washed him out . - He washed himselfout . He only had to pass a few more psych evaluations , but ... he refused to take them . His wife was dead . He didn 't want to lay on the couch and share it with strangers . That was his call , butlhad tomake one too ! It was tough as hell , but I 'd do it again ! For Christ 's sake , Ray . She wasted away in front of his eyes . What was he supposed to do , suck it up ? Get with the program ? What was his crime ? That he showed a little emotion ? I couldn 't trust him ! When Maggie died , it knocked the hell out ofhim . It knocked the hell out of all ofus . Butyou know and I know he 's still the best we 've got . He and Maggie wrote the book on Mars . He 's had more hours in the sims than the rest ofus put together . We can do this . You give me McConnell as copilot , and we will bring Luke home . It 's a promise . [ Sighs ] Hey . - What 's that ? - That is the exact genetic composition ... of my ideal woman . Hmm . Hey , hey , hey . Hey . My baby . - Now what is it ? - A frog ? [ Beeping ] - Hey , skip . - Hey . Take a look . [ Jim ] Damn . [ Woody ] Whatdo youmake of that ? Duststorm . Southern hemisphere , coming from the east . Big fella too . - Headed straight for Mars One base camp . - Yep . - Could get a little hairy right about landing time . - Yeah . Listen , we 're gonna have to be able to move fast . Maybe even advance our E.T.A. These bad boys can cover a whole planet and last up to a year . - When does SI MA do her flyby ? - Tomorrow morning , 0600 . That 's when we find out whether we 've come all this way for nothing .

And look , there 's the green house . Well , we know Luke survived for at least a few hours . Now , are there anysigns of recent activity ? There . Scan northe astern quadrant of base camp . What the hell are those ? Graves . [ Phil ] Wait aminute . There 's only three of them . - That means Luke 's still gotta be alive . - Phil , no , no . Itjust means there was no one lef t to bury him . - Check the radiation levels . - Check rad levels . Normal . - Go to disaster site . - Go to 41 by 9 . - [ Woody ] What 's wrong ? - [ Phil ] ldon 't know . Magnetic interference ? - Go infrared . - Switch to infrared . It 's gotta be a problem with SI MA . I don 't see how an earthquake six months ago could cause this kind ofdistortion . That was no quake . We are going to continue analysing this data ... and try to determine what the problem is with those images . We agree that the evidence of the graves is , uh , inconclusive ... and that a groundsearch is advisable . Frankly , we are as stumped asyouguys , but we 'llkeep onit . - Beware there are little sand storms kicking up ... - Bureau babble . near Mars One base . But the big one youspotted is turningsouth .

[ Luke ] When they met at the Air Force Academy , it was love at firsr flight . Woody 's line . [ Woody ] Later , during NASA training , things got a little tough . Yes , Maggie always did keep jim on a short leash . Jim was always trying to explore a heavenly body . [ Laughing Continues ] - Where are the ygoing ? - [ Phil ] Ten thousandmile-high club .

[ Clears Throat ] They are adding a wonderful chapter to their incredible story , and it 's a pretty historic one . - To the newly appointed co-commanders of Mars One , Jim and Maggie ! - Hear , hear ! - [ People Whooping ] - I will drink to that . - thank you . - [ Luke ] Hold it . It 's not over . - [ Phil ] Show ' em , show ' em . - Yeah , we got a little addendum . - Check this out , guys . Here we go . - It 's Phil 's best work . Look , it 's Mars . You can pick up these postcards atyour local NASA souvenir shop . When you two land up there , it will prove once and for all ... - that there really is no intelligent life on Mars . - All right , touché . - You 're gonna eat those words . - I don 't think so . - Give me the camera . - [ Woody ] Uh-oh , here we go . - [ Maggie ] What if I 'm right ? - [ Woody ] What if she 's right ? - You okay ? - [ Maggie ] Can 't it just be about science ? - We 'll do the science , and do it really well , - Yeah . because that 's what we 've trained for . But what if there 's more ? In all our myths , in every human culture , Mars has always held a special attraction . I mean , what if that means something ? The universe is not chaos . It 's connection . Life reaches out for life . That 's what we were born for , isn 't it ? To stand on a new world and look beyond it to the next one . [ Sighs ] It 's who we are . You know , she may have been right . If that wasn 't a quake down there , then something else caused it ... or planned it . You 're thinkin the same thing . It 's never been out of my mind . I think she knew something , Woody . She was the only one ofus who ever really believed ... there might be something down there . Yeah , well , we 're not leaving till we fi nd out . Deal ? Deal . [ Beeping ] Range : 6,783 and closing . Sixty-five minutes until Mars Orbital Capture . Okay , people , let 's look sharp . We 're gonna run this simulation onemore time .

Two . - One . - Let 's go to Mars . - [ Grunts ] - Jesus ! [ Computer ] Attitude incorrect . Shut down the engines . Engines negative . No response . I have got no attitude control . - Manual separation . - Negative . The control module ... doesn 't have enough thrust to correct this rotation . We 're too steep . We 're falling into the atmosphere . Christ , at this angle we 're gonna burn up . - How much time we got , Phil ? - I don 't know . Three minutes ? I don 't know . - Where 's the REMO ? - The resupply module ? Why ? There 's no way to link up . Where is it ? [ Computer ] Resupply module located . Resupply module located . - [ Phil ] It 's close . - [ Jim ] How close ? - I don 't know . - Figure it out . - We don 't have time , Phil . Figure it out now . - Jim , we 're dead stick . There 's no way to maneuver this ship into linkup . Not theship . Justus . We go E. V.A. - You want us to transfer in suits ? - Ifwe don 't make it- - - Ifwe miss the REMO- - - There 's no other choice . Phil , howclose ? [ Computer ] lntersection orbit with REMO . Course intersectionplotted . One kilometer . That 's the best I can do . Prepare to abandon ship . Let 's go ! - [ Terri ] What are you looking for ? - Earth . [ Chuckles ] Hey . When we get back home , we really will have to try this out in the sim . How are we doing on the fuel , Woody ? I 'm at 50 percent . I don 't see the REMO . There it is . Forty-five left , forty-five down . [ Woody ] Oh , Jesus . She 's not where I thought she 'd be . - [ Phil ] We 're gonna miss her . - [ Jim ] What do you think ? You can 't catch it . Not like this . Use the tether . You 'll have one , maybe two shots before she 's out of reach . Negative . It 's toorisky . If we miss it , we gotnothin ' . I 'll leave you the gun . Run a line out to the REMO . I got enough fuel left for that . - You 'll be goin ' too fast . - I 'll aim to overshoot . I 'll brake like hell and arc it in . Piece of cake . I 'll see you in a flash . [ Jet Packs Hissing ] Unhook me . Good to go . Okay , I 'm on a path to overshoot . I 'm going to take the edge off . I 'm out of fuel . Coming in hot . Still long . [ Beeping ] Abandoning the unit . I 'll brake with suit jets . Jesus . Jesus . [ Breathing Heavily ] Suit jets gone . I 'm gonna make contact . - What velocity ? - Impact 's gonna be a little rough . - [ Jim ] At what velocity ? - Thirty-two . I 'm gonna use the gun to slowyou . - If you slow me , I 'll fallshort . - [ Jim ] It 's too fast , Woody . No choice ! I 'll be okay . Here we go ! Gotcha . [ Grunts ] Woody ! - Woody ! - [ Grunting ] Woody ! Woody ! [ Breathing Deeply ] Woody ! - Woody ! - No , no , no , no , no . No , no , no . - Terri . - What ? Take the gun . Take it . Phil , hang on . Go ! - [ Jim ] Woody , what 'syour status ? - Well , uh , my suitjets are gone , and I 'm still carrying a good deal of velocity . Soon as we get hooked up , I 'll come getyou . [ Woody ] I 'd have to say negative on that , Jim . - Negative on the transmission ? - No , I heard ya . Negative on the maneuver . - I am not retrievable . - [ Terri ] Woody , you 're not going that fast . [ Woody ] Well , it all comes down to the amount of fuel , honey . Suit jets are designed for attitude control , not travel . - Retrieval just won 't work . - Well , it 's gotta work . Hey , listen . I don 't like it any more than you do . - Run the numbers , Jim . - I am . [ Beeping ] You hang tight , Woody . We 'll get in the REMO , drop her down and come scoopyou up . - [ Woody ] Sounds good , Jim . - [ Terri ] It 's gonna takehalf anhour ... to get the REMO reoriented . Woody will be in the atmosphere by then ! Then we 'll just have to get her moving faster . - We don 't have time . - Listen to Jim , honey . It 's a good plan . No . We 're gonna come getyou . - [ Jim ] Okay , get ready for brakes . - Come on , now . - On my mark . Three , two , one . - [ Woody ] You can do it ! Youcan do it ! - Come on ! Come on ! - [ Jim ] Mark . Yeah ! Yeah ! - Everybody good ? - We 're on , Jim . Way to go . Way to go . Good job . All right . There won 't be enough room for us inside . Soon as I get the hatch open , let 's start dumping the cargo . - [ Jim ] Copy that . Hang on , Woody . - Will do , Jim . Hello , beautiful . [ Breathing Heavily ] - Come on . - [ Jim ] Allright . It 's open . - [ Shouts ] - Terri , no ! Terri ! Come back ! - You 'll never make it ! - Terri , what are you doing ? I 'll tell you what I 'm not doing , Woody . I 'm not gonna watch you die . - [ Woody ] Terri . - You 'd do the same for me . Phil , get inside , dump the cargo and start the systems . Now ! - [ Woody ] No , I wouldn 't . Not if it was impossible . - I can do it ! No , you can 't ! You don 't have enough fuel to come get me and get us back . - [ Breathes Deeply ] - Listen to me , goddam it . - You have to stop , and you have to stop now . - He 's right , Terri . It 's no use . [ Beeping ] - Okay , honey . - [ Sobbing ] You gotta go back now . The hell I do . [ Whispers ] Yeah . [ Gasps ] [ Gasping ] What are you doing ? I 'm gonna jet in a little closer and try again . Terri , you spend any fuel getting closer , you won 't get back . And if anyone tries to get you , they 'll die too . - [ Breathing Heavily ] - Honey , please . Please go back . Go back and help the others to the surface . I am not losing you ! I can 't let you do it . I can 't let you die . I 'm sorry . Wait . What are you doing ? - I Love you , honey . - Woody ! No ! No ! - God , how I love you . - Woody ! Don 't ! Woody ! Woody ! Woody ! Don 't ! No ! No ! Please , God , no ! [ Sobbing ] Woody . [ Continues Sobbing ] Woody . [ Continues Sobbing ] Come back , Terri . He 's gone . No . - No ! - Terri . - We need you . - Woody . No . No . No . No . No . Please , Terri . Come back . [ Sighs ] Ray , we 've got some new data just coming in . Wejust- - It doesn 't make any sense . We 're not sure how to read this . - Data ? - Yes . Telemetry reports the REMO left its orbit and reached the Martian surface . - Crashed ? - No , sir . - Under power . - What ? Sixty-three minutes after Mars Recovery went off-line . Sir , the graph shows a controlled descent , but that doesn 't make any sense . They used the REMO as a lander . It 's- - It 's jim McConnell . It 's got to be . Nobody else could have pulled this off . Nobody else . Son of a bitch . [ Hydraulics Hissing ] I 've got access to the E.R.V. I 'm going to go inside . [ Grunting ] [ Phil ] Terri , is the oxygen generator okay ? Yeah . It 's gonna take a while to get it back to 1 00 percent capacity , though . Okay , I 'm entering the hab . [ Beeping ] There 's still oxygen in here . This is a little spooky . I don 't like the dark ... at all . Need some lights . Need some lights . [ Sighs ] Okay . Where are we ? Here we go . E.R.V. appears to be structurally intact . - [ Grunts ] - [ Beeping ] Yeah , butjust as we thought , the computers are fried . Copy that . I got busted fi lters here . Clogged intakes . Hell of a cleanup job , but so far , no major damage . I 'm in the greenhouse . You gotta see this . What is it , Jim ? [ Jim ] It 's working . I 'llbe damned . [ Inhales Deeply ] [ Sniffs ] - Luke . - [ Shouting , Grunting ] [ Struggling Continues ] You 're not here ! You are not here ! - [ Grunting ] - Your wife is Debra ! - Your son is Bobby ! - No ! You 're reading Treasure Island with him . Luke- - It 's all right . It 's me . - Jim ? - Yeah . No , wait ! No , no , no , wait , wait ! He 's all right . He 's all right . Phil . Terri . Jim--Jim , what are you- - What are you doing here ? You 're not supposed to be- - You 're not supposed to be here . How are you here ? - How are you here ? - This is a rescue mission . Woody wanted me right seat . [ Stammering ] [ Sobbing ] I can 't- - I can 't believe- - [ Continues Sobbing ] Well , where is he ? Where 's Woody ? He didn 't make it . God . Ohh . Ohh . Oh , no . No . Oh , God . Oh , no . Well , it works , you know ? I give them ... CO2 and light , and they give me oxygen and food . It 's- - It 's actually not a bad arrangement . It 's like a marriage , really , except not as many- - not as many fights . - [ Chuckles ] I mean , some fights . - Luke . Tell us what happened here . We fi red the radar , and it- - it came and ... they all died . They all- - They all died . W-What do you mean ? What came ? The force came out of the top of the mountain and- - and- - and ... everybody died , but I was spared . Why ? Why ? Ithad to be forareason . And then all of a sudden , I knew the reason why . It 's so someone would be left to figure out the secret . You know , it 's- - [ Chuckles ] J-J - J ust come . Just come , come , come , come . Come , come . Is itjust me , or is he a few meal packs short of a picnic ? Long-term exposure to low gravity can have an adverse impact on the brain . Or then , he could be suffering from some form of asphyxia . Or maybe his whole crew died , and he 's been marooned alone on Mars for a year . It 's a miracle he survived this long . I 'd better bring him up to speed . Great . Great . Great , great , great , great . So , let me be sure I understand this . Your ship blew up with all its supplies , then you emptied all the cargo out of the REMO , and it was totalled on landing . You got no food , no water , no spare oxygen . Nothing other than what I 'm looking at right here . [ Chuckles ] What k- - What kind of rescue mission is this , Jim ? [ Chuckles ] - That kind . - Check it out . New nav boards for the E.R.V. I got four round-trip tickets , baby , right in here . [ Chuckles ] Thank you , God . Oh , thank God . [ Luke ] When I came to and dug myselfout of the sand , my faceplate was cracked . It was ... Ieaking , leaking badly . I barely made it back to base . It was weeks before I could work up the nerve to go back out there ... and look for- - [ Sighs ] and look for their bodies . Renee was the only one I could find , but itjust ... didn 't seem right somehow tojust dig one grave . [ Sighs ] Oh , God . [ Wind howling ] - Has it been blowin like this for a while ? - Yeah . [ Jim ] We sawabigstorm on ourscreens , butMickersaid it was turningsouth . Ifit holds course . Luke , this- - this whatever it was- - this- - this force- - You said it came directly out of the top of the mountain ? Don 't you believe me ? [ Scoffs ] That 's okay , Jim . You don 't believe me , that 's okay . But I 'm not crazy , I know that much . - I 'm not crazy . - What 'd you mean by its " secret " ? What secret ? Listen , hundreds of millions of years have gone by , okay ? You 've got erosion , lava flow , sand storms , meteor impacts . Hell , in that time the whole surface of the planet would have changed , so it 's no wonder we never saw it before . I mean , we saw it , but not like they meant us to . There was too much dirt on it . Saw what , Luke ? Saw this . Jesus . Oh , my God . Luke , what are you trying to tell us ? - Are you trying to tell us that 's a face ? - That 's the face . [ Luke ] It 's the face . It 's real . Somebody put that thing there , andit 's notus . Jim- - It 's not possible . [ Gasps ] Jesus . - Lookat that . - [ Terri ] My God . - [ Chuckles ] - I know . Luke , what about that sound you heard before the explosion ? Oh , yeah , good , Jim . That 's the key . That 's the key . [ Low Hum ] You hear that ? Yeah . [ Low Pulses ] - Those pauses . Do you hear the pauses ? - Mm-hmm . See , that 's what made me realize it 's a pattern . It 's a repeating pattern . - Mathematical ? - [ Luke ] Mm-hmm . That occurred tome too . There are distinctblocks within eachpattern , and within each block , the tones come in groups of three . It 's three-three-three , three-three-three . Always three-three-three . It 's always thesame . Formonths , lstruggled toanalyze it , trying different constructs , and then I thought about dimensions . - X-Y-Z coordinate . - Exactly . Three groups equals three dimensions . So l-l assigned different graphic values to each block , group and tone , and I came up with this . [ Whirring ] - [ Luke ] Hello . - [ Phil ] Oh , my God . Is that what I think it is ? - [ Terri ] DNA . - You see it ? Yeah . It 's a model of DNA . [ Phil ] So--So somebody left that thing here . Okay . Somebody other than human . But , uh , what is it ? It 's a signature . It 's a self-portrait ofwhatever species created the face . Yeah , but that DNA looks human . [ Terri ] No , it 's not . It 's missing thelastpair ofchromosomes , see ? - [ Jim ] lt 's close . It 's damn close . - [ Terri ] Close ? The difference between man and ape is less than three percent genetic material . But that three percent gives you Einstein , Mozart . Jack the Ripper . [ Luke ] Yeah , he 's right . Four pallets , oral , topical medications , splints , bandages , one complete med pack . With eight tubes of antifungal cream . Well , at least we won 't rash to death . [ Chuckles ] Luke . - How do you feel ? - Lighter . - A lot lighter . - Welcome back . Thanks , man . The backup generator is salvageable . So are two of the solar panels . I 'm pretty sure I can get the oxygen still back into production . So we 're not in such bad shape , considering . That 's good , Terri . Good work . Jesus . Look at this . Phil 's idea of absolute essentials . Ofcourse . - [ Chuckles ] - [ ComputerBeeping ] Hey , hey , hey ! Hey ! My baby . It 's not a signature . [ Luke ] What ? The noise from the face . It 's not a signature . It 's a test . It 's asking us for the right answer . It wants us to put in the missing pair ofchromosomes . - Why ? - To prove that we 're human . We fi red radar into that thing , concentrated radio waves , and you 're saying- - Which it interpreted as the wrong answer . It 's- - It could be like a security alarm . When it gets an incorrect response , it defends itself . So what happens when it gets the right answer ? Well , I don 't know that , Phil . But we gotta find out . Luke , what ifwe work this the otherway ? We figure out which tones would be equivalent to the missing chromosomes , and then dub them into your recording of the signal . - Is that possible ? - Yeah . - Yeah , l-l think so . - Good , good , good . What about the radar gun ? Will it accept the input ... so we can transmit a completed signal back to the face ? [ Phil ] Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Holdon , Jim . What if you 're wrong ? Whoever goes out there- - I mean , what if you 're wrong ? Three people have already died over that thing . [ Terri ] Four . Terri . Ifwe leave here without getting some answers , they all died in vain . We don 't- - We don 't have to go out there . [ Jim ] Got alot of static here . Something 's interfering . [ Luke ] Yeah . The antenna got knocked around pretty badly in the blast . This is the best resolution I thinkwe 're gonna be able to get . All right , guys . I got the nav boards . I 'm sealing the air lock . - Check the video feed . - Video feed looks good . - How close do we have to get ? - [ Luke ] I 'm notsure . Maybe I 'll stop it right over there by that rock . Do it . Good . [ Static ] [ Sighs ] Okay . Here we go . [ Sighs ] [ Whirring ] Lookat that , Jim . [ Chuckles ] It worked . Oh , God , it worked . Guys , I don 't know what the hell wejust did , but does that look to you like a hostile gesture ? No . More like an invitation . Oranothertest . - Check for radiation . - [ Luke ] Normal . Seismic normal . Anemometer steady . Luke , does the rover still work ? Phil , do you read ? Yeah , Jim . Your signal 's breaking up a little in the storm , but I read you . We 're at the face . We 're gonna need a few minutes here . Same deadline . Launch at 1 950 with or without us . Copy ? Copy that . Jim , you sure you want to do this ? I 'm not sure about anything any more . But I didn 't come 1 00 million miles just to turn back in the last ten feet . Yeah . Please work . - This is gonna work . - [ Machinery Beeping , Whirring ] Yes . Yes . Computers are on-line . I am going to start loading software . [ Jim ] The surface ... seems fi rm and level . [ Luke ] Roger that . - [ Luke ] The texture 's smooth . - [ Terri ] I 've got good footing . [ Terri ] No obstructions . Let 's check our P.S.I. Guys , I gotta tell you- - We 're losing visibility here really fast . Over . - [ All Breathing Heavily ] - [ Terri ] It 's solid . We 're trapped . [ Jim ] Don 't move . Just keep this orientation . Guys ? Luke ? Terri ? Jim ? Phil , can you still hear me ? Is anyone there ? Over . [ Grunting ] God . That 's it . There 's no handles . We 're not gettin out ofhere unless they let us out . - Jim , whatare you doing ? - What are you doing ? Stop it ! Stop it ! - [ Terri ] You 're depressurizing ! - [ Luke ] Seal your suit now ! - There 's pressure in here . - Above Mars atmospheric . It 's impossible . We 're millions of miles from Earth inside a giant white face . What 's impossible ? There 's 12 P.S.I. in here . Nitrogen and oxygen . Otherwise known as air . [ Chuckling ] Hey , wait Jim . I haven 't checked for lethal trace gases , and I haven 't- - [ Sighs ] What the hell . - [ Chuckling ] - [ Chuckling ] Look . - Is that what I think it is ? - Yeah . It 's Mars . [ Luke ] That 's where they went . [ Jim ] Look . One stayed behind . [ Terri ] Earth . Before the continents separated . [ Luke ] My God . That 's it . Hundreds of millions of years ago , there was a sudden explosion of life on Earth . The first multi-celled plants and animals appeared . No one has ever understood why or how it happened . [ Luke ] They seeded Earth . [ Luke ] They seeded Earth . They 're us . We 're them . Luke ? Terri ? Jim ? Anyone ? E.R.V. to rover . Rover , this is E.R.V. Does anyone copy ? Does anyone copy ? [ Phil Breaking Up OverRadio ] E.R. V. torover . Rover , this is E.R. V. - Do you copy ? - Phil ? - Oh , thank God . - Phil , we read you . Listen , this storm is getting really bad . It 's going to totally sock us in in a few minutes . You 've got to get back . - Phil ? - I repeat .. You 've got to getback to theship . Phil ? We 're in a ship . This ... is a ship . And the ... countdown 's already started . - He 's right . - Yeah . Yeah , let 's get the hell outta here . Jim ? Jim ? Come on , we gotta go . - I 'm not comin ' with you . - [ Terri ] What ? What are you talking about ? You 've gotta get home . That 's where I 'm going . Don 'tyou see ? That 's- - That 's what all this is for . Terri , you were right . This is an invitation . This is aninvitation for us to follow them home . I 'm going . It 's what I was born for . Like Maggie said . To stand on a new world and ... and look beyond it to the next one . I know this is right ... for me . You 're running out of time . You gotta get back to the E.R.V. , and you gotta get off this planet . Thank you for saving my life , buddy . It was a privilege . [ Sniffles ] I wish Woody were here to see you . He is here , Terri . We wouldn 't have made it without him . [ Sighs ] He would have wanted you to have this . E.R.V. to rover . Rover , this is E.R.V. Do you copy ? E.R.V. to Rover . Rover , this is E.R.V. Do you read me ? Phil , this is Luke . Do you copy ? - He 's not reading me . - I can barely read you . - Let 's get the hell out ofhere . - Yeah . I 've lost the base camp beacon . - We 're driving blind . - I 'm just going to keep going on a straight line , okay ? That 's our only chance . - 1949 , Terri . We 're notgonnamake it . - No . I 've worked with Phil for four years , and I knowJim gave him a direct order , but he is not gonna leave without us . Please . Luke ? Terri ? Jim ? E.R.V. to rover . Rover , this is E.R.V. Do you read me ? [ Luke Breaking Up OverRadio ] Phil , do youread ? This is Luke . We 're coming in . Phil ? - Phil ? - Phil isn 't here right now . He , uh , left for Earth five minutes ago ! Please leave a message after the beep ! [ Relieved Laughter ] [ Grunting ] Where is jim ? He caught another ride . - Dear God , look at that . - Is that him ? [ Luke ] Have a greatride , Jim .

A dream ? I - I don 't think so , man . Honey bunny . No . I 'm not listening to my dead boyfriend . Hey . I know . This is a Total Recall plot , set in motion by some evil villain who has me trapped on a hidden level . No . This-This isn 't your real place . Sweetie ... Though it is very realistic . Sweetie , you had a dream . It 's okay . I 'm here . No . The last six months of my life could not have been a dream . It was - It was just too high-concept for me to conjure up out of thin air . Never underestimate what that brain of yours can conjure up . You 've been doing a lot of deep sleeping since the operation . Those pills the Doc gave you really zone you out . It was all a dream ? Hel and Sarge ? Oh , Johnny , I don 't understand this . Mmm . You smell good . You bought it for me . Is it really you ? Am I really here ? It 's really me , and you 're really home . Wow . Very impressive . I like that . Come on , Cleo . Cleo . What was that ? Mauser ? Whoever is in that tube appears to have Cleo trapped . What ? Well , not for long . Nothing . Do you think someone hijacked Cleo while we were in the Bailey sim ? Why would someone want to take Cleo ? Hel , Sarge . I 've established a weak remote link to the simulation Cleopatra is trapped in . What 's it simulating ? I 'm not certain , but it 's huge . Can you get us in ? Yes , but I can 't tell how close you 'll actually be to Cleo . It 's a start , anyway . This new technology does allow for the interaction of your weaponry with the simulation . But any simulated weaponry that we might encounter could interact with us . I 'm afraid so . Sounds like fun . Shall we ? Oh , let 's . So much for not calling any attention to ourselves . What the hell is this place ? I don 't know . Freeze . I said , freeze . They have weapons . Should we kill them ? Their uniforms indicate figures of authority . Let 's play along for now . Maybe they can help us find Cleo . Shut up . Hands above your head . We apologize if we 've caused any disturbance to your way of life . We promise it won 't happen again . Apology accepted . Good . Do you know someone named - Opening fire on a crowded city street . I 'm sure the judge will accept your apology , too . I 'm done playing . You have the right to remain - " Los Angeles Police . " Los Angeles ? Isn 't that where Cleo went to that acting school ? So this is Cleo 's world ? Pre-Bailey . Too bad we don 't have enough time to go exploring . Hey . You guys ever heard of a girl named Cleopatra ? No . Where 's your nearest exotic dancing forum ? You mean , strip joint ? Yeah . Now , remember , we 're 22st century law enforcement officers . Let 's act like it . Freeze ! Get out of the car . Hands above your head . You have the right to remain . Propulsion system 's still online . Manual course correction . Forward and reverse thrusters ? Yeah , but we 're not moving . I 'll try this . Reverse thrusters . So forward must be ... I think you got it . Hang on . I think you hit them . Oh . No , I just winged them . Sorry . Watch out ! Here it goes , Annie . Name 's Amber . Well , you 're up , babe . Are you sure this is what you want ? I can 't believe you actually got those agents to come . Anything you want , honey bunny . I 'll make it happen . Were you always this good to me , baby ? And now , prepare yourself for the striptease of the future . Guys , let 's give it up for Cleopatra and the dance she likes to call Firefight down the Shaft . There it is , Hel . Slow down . Unless you have a warrant , the cover charge is $ 20 . We 're looking for a girl named - Cleo . Program , initiate security lockout . So you 're the one . Leave us alone . Cleo ! He 's locking us out , Hel . Cleo ! Mauser , boost our projection signal . Who are you ? And what do you want with Cleo ? Look , she 's with me now . Don 't interfere again . Program , enhance security protocol . You 've been warned . Cleo ! All right , Mauser . Can you get us back in or not ? Yes , I 've amplified your VR signatures . The extra power boost won 't allow him to lock you out this time , but it will inhibit my ability to withdraw you from the simulation . He must voluntarily shut it down if you are all to escape . He 'll volunteer all right . I haven 't been able to locate Cleo precisely as her simulation is running at an extremely accelerated rate . To Cleo , nearly 24 days have already passed . However , I should be able to put you back at your previous exit point . Ready ? Let 's do it . See you there . We 're closed , ladies , unless you 're here to audition . We 're always looking for fresh talent . We 'll pass . We 're looking for Cleopatra . Hey , you 're the two cops that were here the other day . So what are you , undercover or somethin ' ? Actually , you 'd be doing us a really big favor if you could just tell us where Cleo is . If you were to put on a little private show , I might be able to help . Actually , I have a better idea . Why don 't you dance for me ? That 's it , big boy . That 's what I like . Johnny took her to the park . She 's in the park . I love her work . Pretty exciting , huh , babe ? You blew those agents away . Yeah , it was a killer routine . Are you kidding me ? They want to fly you to Vegas . Your own show on the Strip . I thought that 's what you wanted . It was . I love to dance but that dance didn 't save the life of a slave girl , or help retrieve the pod or ... You 've lost me . I just feel like I 've been part of something bigger . Or dreamed I was . Uh , I don 't know . I just don 't know if I could be happy with this life anymore . Then pick another one . What ? Well , I mean , you can be anything . Anything in the world you want . Look behind you . Oh , my God . This is where we kissed for the first time . How did we get here ? The only thing that matters is we 're together . Oh . I love you , Cleo . Will you marry me ? Look out ! Are you okay ? There she is . Move . Hel ? Sarge ? Cleo . Cleo . We gotta get out of here . W - W-Wait . These are my friends . The ones I was telling you about . What are you doing here ? Program , engage intruders with type 4-GR weapon configuration . What are you doing ? What does that mean ? Get away from him . This isn 't real . You 've been playing me all along . Cleo , I can explain . What the hell is this ? Who are you ? It 's not what you think . The hell it 's not . Let her go ! Everything since fighting the Bailies in those simulators , the Betrayer fight ? It 's all been a simulation , Cleo . You never left your tube . And whoever he is has us all trapped inside . Pretty slick . Making me think I was out of my tube , Johnny . Seeing my friends shot . Yeah . Nice touches that really helped me make the leap . Program , re-engage intruders at my command . You know you 're really making this hard for me to say yes . Cleo , you have to believe me . I 'm not some villain with an evil plot up his sleeve . I 'm Johnny . Johnny 's dead . You died once , but you came back . Why can 't you accept that I did , too ? So you were frozen ? I couldn 't live without you , honey bunny . Would you stop ? They thawed me out and I searched for you . For years , I tried to find you . I learned to do this . I built this world for you , for us . So that we could lead the lives we were meant to . And then two months ago , I saw you . Why didn 't you say anything ? Program , arm and raise weapons . Don 't you come any closer . No . If you really are Johnny , then stop this . Let my friends go and we 'll start over in year 2525 . We wouldn 't stand a chance in that world , Cleo . If you are who you are , why would I want to live my life with a virtual Johnny ? 500 years is a long time not to touch you . If you want to be with me , then be with me for real , baby . Same stubborn Cleo . God , I love that about you . Baby . Hel ? Sarge ? You all right , kiddo ? Johnny ? Oh , sweetie . What 'd you do ? Baby . They thawed me out 50 years too soon . Why didn 't you tell me ? I would have ... You would have what ? Would you have wanted to be with me like this ? You have a big heart , Cleo . But I would never ask that of you . To remember us by , honey bunny . Baby ? His projection into his younger self appears to have drained his cellular - Mauser , shut up . Hey , Cleo . I 'm gonna need a little help with this one , guys . We 're here . For as long as it takes . Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries

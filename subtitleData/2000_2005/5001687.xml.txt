 Previously on Farscape ... - What about Scorpius ? - What about him ? Well , he might 've been captured . Harvey ! You must ... go back for him . We 're going to walk into the most heavily guarded base in the Scarran empire , start a civil war and walk out with Scorpius . What part of that do you not understand ? Why shouldn 't I have you seized , right now ? Well , maybe this . A fission bomb . My heart stops , we all go boom . He 's crazy ! Isn 't it fun ? What am I offered for all the powers of the Universe ? Give us wormhole weapons and everyone will be safe . Have you got anything to offer or is all this just an elaborate bluff ? You don 't believe that I can control wormholes ? An entire cavern just to grow the flowers they eat ? Why ? I 'm going to capture your soul . Scorpius can 't possibly hold out much longer ! Rygel ? The Scarrans will never make you rich . How much hatred exists here , between the Charrids and the Kalish ? Where the hell is my riot ? I will not be humiliated by you , Vakali . Will you betray me ? I have served you for ten cycles as a spy . Don 't fire or you 'll detonate the bomb . You stupid son of a bitch ! I 'm sorry , John . And now on Farscape ... You do not know what you 're doing . Yah , I do and I 'm gonna frickin nuke you and half this damn base ! Kill me later . I should kill you now . You 're still my prisoner . - Technically , he 's my prisoner . - Thank you , John . When Aeryn wakes up , she 's gonna kill him ! I 'm so pleased to see you 're all safe . Minister Ahkna 's forces have done a superb job in quelling the unrest . A duty to which I 'm sure she 's eager to return . See you later , sweetheart . Thank you . Aeryn ? Did we win ? You 'll be delighted to hear my guards were able to secure the rest of your crew as well . Coincidentally as they were also nearing exits . Like yourselves , I 'm sure they were simply trying to avoid ... any entanglement in violence . Where are they ? There are guards placed to insure their ... well-being . Were you planning to leave ? Temporarily . Grayza called with another offer . But you had a riot goin on , we didn 't want to bother you . We decided to take our own car . I 'm glad you didn 't . Base defenses have been placed on highest alert . Any non-Scarran vessels will automatically be targeted ... and destroyed . We 're very lucky . We 'll transport you to the Carrier . That 's very kind . My pleasure ... John . Emperor . The craft is an Eradicator , Topratkin design . We 've gained entry and neutralized its systems . Sentinels are now securing the starcharts and the vector logs . Leave no trace when you 've completed . I don 't want them to know what we know . Sir . I prevented you from leaving for your own protection . - You what ? - You stopped us from leaving ? You stuck a knife in our back ! No . Your plan would 've failed . - We could 've been ... on Lo 'Lah by now . - Hear him out . Hear him out ! It is quite likely the Scarrans ... had already disabled D 'Argo 's ship . - That 's impossible . - And found Moya . Even if we managed to get off Katratzi , the base 's weapons would have destroyed us . Stealth is no longer an option . Does Lo 'Lah have enough firepower to blast us out ? Maybe ... probably ... I dunno . It 's worth a shot . How would we do it ? I 'd call Lo 'Lah , she 'd blast a hole and we 'd run through . - Do it before someone else screws us . - Okay . Somebody 's jammed the comms . - No , no . The comms are working fine . - They must have disabled Lo 'Lah . That is impossible . Hey , what about the Command Carrier ? - Can we still get a free ride outta here ? - Try it and find out . We don 't know what you 're talking about . Oh , let me enlighten you . Grayza doesn 't frighten me . Her Command Carrier doesn 't frighten me . Your bomb doesn 't frighten me and neither do you . Damn . I 'm on the brink of devastation , Minnie Pearl . Perhaps we should go there together . Subtitles : PK SUB-66 WE 'RE SO SCREWED , PART THREE : LA BOMBA 1812 ... is this room bug free ? Good boy . Okay ... convince me . Crystherium Utilia . The flower . Yes . Very important . Ahh ... they 'd better be . That why they 're grownin in in the Bat Cave ? That 's right , you 've been there . Listen up , Grasshopper . I finally have a plan that works . It 's simple . We get in , we break bread ... we see the sights , we grab you , we get out . And now you 're gonna throw flowers at me ? We need to destroy the Crystherium . - Flowers trump wormholes ? - At the moment , yes . What have I told you about smokin in my head ? - Hey ! - Sit down ! - Well , I ain 't sayin nothin . You said the ... the boss . - Sit Down ! I 'm talking to you . Flowers . The number one secret in the whole Scarran Empire . Huh ! Even the Charrids and the Kalish haven 't figured its real deal . Stark used to live here on Katratzi , assisting the leadership caste with their death rituals . My side , your side . My side , your side ! Frell me again ! That why you were torturing him when I met you ? That 's right . Crystherium growth requires very specific and rare conditions . The Scarrans ... can only propel their power forward from these very few locations . And destroying a bunch of flowers is supposed to set ' em back ? For hundreds of cycles . Why ? Cause they need ' em ... Scarrans ... simplistic , brutish creatures . Shoulda died out generations ago . What happens if they eat the flower ? Big brains ... evolutionarily competitive . Hey ... you know . Staleek , Ahkna . And if they don 't eat ' em ? Yer dog could beat ' em at checkers ! Hey ! Though Stark provided many details , I was unable to learn of Katratzi 's location . You ... rescued him ... - prior to that breakthrough . - Sorry to stitch you up . No you 're not . You were taking too long with the wormholes , John . Reality ... provides opportunity . I needed some way to hurt the Scarrans ... now . You know , you 're not ... you ... you ... you 're not ... makin any sense . You ... you ... you take the knowledge from my head ... and then you tell me that you give it to him ... what , s ... so I 'm gonna rescue him ? I have no wormhole knowledge , John . - But Harvey said ... - Scorpius knows everything you know . So what ? I lied . Harvey ? Oh , that is clever . We had a deal . I help you rescue Aeryn Sun from the Scarrans , you give me wormholes . The Boss says ... ' lay low . Don 't go near him anymore . Give him some peace . But obviously you betrayed our contract , yes ? But you know what ? You went and left him behind to die . You had no intention of returning for my rescue , did you ? Fail-safe . You screw the boss ... I find a way to get you re-interested . You 're trying to lay this off on me ? You see , if my neural clone has returned , it is only because ... you have betrayed me . You 're trying to say Harvey 's back because of me ? - You should honor your contracts , John . - No ... no contract . You betrayed us . - We had a deal . - NO ! He screwed us ! And now you get on your highhorse . We had a deal ! Hey ! You took a bribe . You banked the cut , but when the heat 's on ... you 're just another dumb copper doing his job . Unbelievable ! Hey ... look at these little beauties ! Would you have left me to perish with the Scarrans ? Under the circumstances ya ! Hey , he 's right you know . We 're brothers from different sides of an imaginary line . - Good , bad , bad good . Your side , my side , my side ... - Sitdown ! So ... here we are ... Cadaver and Hutch . A team . What now ? We ... must destroy the flowers . And if I say no ? I will attempt to accomplish the task myself . However , rest assured ... mine is now the only path off Katratzi . Hey ! Hey , you better listen to him , screw . He 's smarter than you . - You used me . - We use each other . - You 're better at it . - Oh , you 're learning . The bomb clever . When it goes off plan on being nearby . Four hundred Scarran Scrambler Cannons were trained on us the microt that you entered here . Minister Ahkna informed us that , unless you were returned to them safely , they 'd fire . Well , they can 't do that . To honor the truce , they have to let you go wherever you want . They 'll let us go . They just won 't let you leave with us . They feel it violates the terms of the agreement . Braca . Officer Sun . - Could we have a moment alone please ? - Stay on comms . There 's nothing that I can do to help . Even the enhanced marauder wouldn 't get you clear . The Scarrans are on full alert , weapons primed ... you 'll never get out of here . I 'll see you later . Where are you going ? That 's a medical area . I have something I need to take care of . Personal problem ? Let 's go . So you need to watch ? Wait for here . All that astonishing wormhole knowledge ... and still you will not share it with us . You came in here big and bold , dancing on tabletops . And look at you now ... begging for scraps . I may be jammed ... possibly dead ... but I am not begging . You can get that fantasy out of your head . In my hands , you can have peace . I can ... have ... peace ! I have been in your hands ! There 's no peace there ... just power . You are so self-righteous ! I have used all my skills ... all my resources ... for one perfect chance at peace . And because of you ... it is gone ... and I am ... Frelled ? Screwed ? Raped ? Welcome to the Universe , Commandant . I can 't believe they 're allowing us inside . Everything 's working , right ? - Yah , it seems to be . - All right . Well , let 's get the others . Blast our way outta here . No , no . Someone 's been in here . I can smell it . Well , the defenses were up , right ? No . I don 't know what they 've done . Maybe frelled with the weapons . Planted a homing beacon ... or a bomb . Frell it ! I have to shut the ship down and run a full systems diagnostic check . How long will that take ? Three arns . Well , what if it finds something that we can 't fix ? Then we go with Scorpius ' plan . Frelling elevators . Lock ourselves in an elevator while it tunnels through the solid rock ? Sounds reasonable . Sounds fahrbot . Sikozu may not be able to provide elevator access , therefore we need to locate someone who can . - Stark . - What ? Who 's Stark ? Another lunatic with the wrong number of eyes . - And there he is . - He 's not . That is a bioloid replica . And how do you know that ? Stark would never torture me . Emperor Staleek ... replaced the real Stark with a bioloid ... to fool Ahkna into believing he was real . But you 're actually working for Staleek . So he believes . Oh , I do admire your compartmentalization of duplicity . How do we find the real Stark ? Find the bioloid duplicator . Stark is undoubtedly imprisoned within it . Where 'd you disappear to on the Command Carrier ? Some unfinished business . Want to tell me about it ? Later . D 'Argo 's still workin on his ship ... and Sikozu 's tryin to scan the codes . Any other alternatives ? Well , we could always give the Scarrans what they want . Dead in a few microts . Or we could try the banzai approach . Or we could just follow Scorpy 's plan . Damn ! You cannot stop following me around , can you ? And you just can 't leave . Wouldn 't Grayza help you ? Actually , she 's the high bidder . Perhaps now is the time for you to hear my offer . You 'll go free ... now . What 's the price ? You leave Scorpius behind , for me . What 's in it for you ? I will make sure the hierarchy blames Staleek for your escape . You understand I know nothing about Scarran politics . But I 'm ... guessing that means that they fire him ... and you get his job . Ambition . Well , ' if it were done when ' tis done , t 'were best it were done quickly . Thanks . She scares the crap outta me . It 's the hat . Emperor ... about Crichton 's bomb . In under a quarter of an arn we will have computed the final code . With it , this will disarm the detonator . Sir . Satisfactory . Security 's been heightened since the riots . - All the codes have been changed . - What can be done ? There 's a master keychip that overrides all codes . It 'll run the elevator and give you complete access to the system 's schematics . - Can you get it ? - Not very easily . And if I get caught , that ... Could expose the entire Kalish underground . Just tell me this ... will it help defeat the Scarrans ? Yes . Yes , it will . So , what do you think ? I think Lady MacBeth is gonna find a way to screw us , but Staleek is probably way ahead of her . - Which leaves us with Plan ... - E ? - E for ... elevator . - Elevator . And I 'm gonna tap dance for the Emperor . Be careful . He 's not an idiot . I know , but he can 't do jack to me as long as this bomb 's ticking . - You can 't reactivate the bomb in any way ? - Not in any useful manner . So , what are we supposed to do then ? D. Can you get Lo 'Lah reactivated ? Well , it should be another arn at least . He 'll find us in half that . Sparky , where are ya ? Stuck . Guards all round . Can 't go anywhere at this point . Well , get to the elevator if you can . Right ! Where is the elevator ? Where is Crichton ? He won 't get far . The station is sealed . Minister Ahkna ... that may well be your epitaph . Sikozu has managed to summon the Rabrokator . What the hell is that ? Some kind of massage tool ? It 's a drilling elevator , but it won 't do us any good without the keychip . What 's he doing here ? Scorpius ? He 's giving us the shaft , as usual . Everybody in . Mind the gap . Safer in than out . Try and crosswire the drilling controls . - Yes , we can try , but it will not work without ... - Wait ! - W ... w ... wait ! - Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! I 've got it . Thank you . Get us moving . - We have navigational control . - Then go ! You drive like dren ! - Get the drills working . - I 'm trying , but it 's gonna take a little bit of time . Take us to the bottom of the Chrystherium cavern . The shaft ends there . It means they will not be able to reach us in another car . It also means ... Sikozu has time ... to activate the drill . Crichton ? Crichton ! Ah , frell him ! - Let 's find Stark . - Good idea . Why ? Cause Scorpius claims Stark knows this base . Maybe he knows a way out . They 're in the Rabrokator . We 're trying to override . Ma 'am ... sensors detect weapons fire within the base ... and communication intercepts indicate ... Scarran forces are in pursuit of Crichton with orders to kill . They must have deactivated the bomb . Then he 's lost . As are we . - Go to battle stations . - Ma 'am ? Are you questioning me ? I cannot get the drills activated . Sputnik , stay on it . Chiana ! The doors ! Frell ! Got it ! - Aeryn , stay with him . - Be careful . That was not me . They 're trying to override the override ! Dueling overrides . Don 't you hate that ? Okay , Lo 'Lah should be functional by now . Start the drills . Get us to the surface . I 'll signal Lo 'Lah and then we go ! - We must destroy them . - Why ? The mother plant is the key . It fertilizes the others . Kill it ... and no new Crystherium can grow here . Shielded . The Rabrokator is stopped at the Crystherium Cavern . I want it recalled ... now ! Come on . Hurry up . This door 's getting pushier . Stark didn 't know about it . Stark didn 't know about it ! This must be a new addition by the Scarrans . He doesn 't like to lose , does he ? Got it . The drills are enabled . We can core our way to anywhere on the planet . I 've regained control of the drilling elevator . Now get it back up to this level . D 'Argo ! - I 'll handle it . - Yah . Get it open ! Frell ! D 'Argo , hurry up ! Go , go , go , go , go ! - W ... w ... wait ! - Go ! Go ! - Keychip . What the hell 's going on up there ? We couldn 't override their override of our override . Great ! They stole our getaway car . That 's our only way out . And their way in . Your father would be proud , Ahkna . Security under him was riddled with top-down incompetence as well . Emperor ... the Command Carrier is showing increasing signs of battle readiness . Any other exits ? No ... it 's nothing but rock and hay-fever . - Company 's coming . - Frell . - Time to go . - Grasshopper ? - Hide ! Get down . Hey , did you get my bomb ? What ? Wh ... I can 't believe it . I left a nuclear bomb in an elevator . That 's all right . You 've done worse . These weapons will be useless if they 're Scarrans . It 's gonna be Scarrans . She cannot be taken alive , John . Be quiet . - Am I wrong , or are we frelled ? - No . There is a way . I am not like normal Kalish . There are others like me . We are part of a resistance movement dedicated to overthrowing Scarran domination . We are ... genetically engineered ... to kill Scarrans ... by emitting an intense radiation ... that specifically destroys their heat-producing gland . Did anyone else know about this , or is it just me ? Okay Sikozu , go ahead . Not without a promise first . If the Scarrans were to learn there are others engineered like myself , they would kill millions of innocents to root us out . Sikozu ... we 're a team . Your promise is safe . Guards . D 'Argo the Scarrans are very good at retrieving the truth . - We 're not gonna be tortured again . - Agreed . Agreed . Go . Do not look upon me . Especially ... you . Hold fire . Kalish ... present yourself and surrender . - Okay ... Chiana , grab the weapons ! - Got it . - Come on Scorp , let 's go . - Let 's go . She 'll be fine . Get those weapons . Grasshopper ... it 's time . No ! We gotta go . Do the math ... it 's over . I ... do not lose ! Be happy to give you lessons . Now ... you in or out ? Come on , let 's go . Come on ! Hurry up ! Is that him ? Yes . Yes , it is . Open it up . Stark ... Stark ! Are you alive ? Rygel ? Oh , you lunatic . You ... you 're green . How lovely of you to notice . Is nothing sacred ? You wantta deal with Stark ? You 're gonna have to deal with me . Oh ! Let go ! You pompous little Dominar of Nothing ... I 'm gonna rip your tiny little heart out . - Thanks Witch ! - My pleasure ! Commandant Grayza ... see reason . Reason indicates ... that you have subverted this conference and with it , any chance of peace . Ridiculous ! Your vessel arms itself for battle , while we continue to operate under a banner of truce . Reason dictates that I not believe a single word you say . Reconsider , Peacekeeper . Adhere to the name you have chosen for your kind . Monitor their every move and transmission . Should they attack ... annihilate them without mercy . Ma 'am , what are you doing ? Pursuing honor , Captain . We 're at peace ... under truce ... and vastly outnumbered . And about to rewrite the course of history . Prepare to launch simultaneous salvos on every weapons system ... now ! Sergeant . - Have we solved the override problem yet ? - Not yet . - Did you put the key in ? - Yes , I used the frelling key . Why do we even bother ? - What are you doing ? - Sending a message . - The connection has been severed . - Fix it . Drill 's on . - Hey ... you know how to drive this Wonkavator ? - Do you ? - No . - Then why ask ? Frell ! Kalish sensors report an unusual energy discharge in the cavern . The status of the Crystherium ? Unknown . We 've lost contact with the Strike Team . And Crichton ? He has activated the drill and is coring through solid rock . Impossible to predict his destination , my love . I 'll tell you your destination , my love . A frelling torture station if you don 't stop him ! Fine , well you at least know how to get where we 're goin , right ? No . Oh , then go faster . Here 's faster . It 's a hell of a ride ! Kinda fun , huh ? Okay , it 's no longer a joke . Protection of the Crystherium was your number one priority . Yes , my Lord , but it was not I who gave permission for the access codes . What are you implying , Rahzaro ? - We had nothing ... - Do not give me your excuses ! Sire ... Commandant Grayza refuses to acknowledge on all frequencies . I credit her choice of suicide over failure . How are you positioned ? Well , they will be accorded every opportunity to cease fire . Peacekeeper Command will find no fault with our self-defense . Captain Jenek here epitomizes the competence I demand . Perhaps you can next assist Minister Ahkna in her follies . Capture Crichton , and her job will be yours . Sire . Fools . Tell me when target acquistions are complete . Ma 'am there is no battle here , Ma 'am . - Why are you so averse to conflict , Captain ? - And why are you so adverse ? ! How dare you ? Who do you think you are ? Captain Miklo Braca , Officer of the Fleet ... Peacekeeper Interplanetary Service . Oh ... Nobody . - Ma 'am , you 'll start a war . - A war is inevitable . We sail under a flag of truce . Let us leave beneath its protection . Didn 't Scorpius tell you ? A truce with the Scarrans is suicide . So the men and women of this vessel ... must pay for your miscalculation with their lives ? It 's for the greater good , Captain ... and we shall all be remembered as heroes . Commandant Grayza ... Under Article Six Rulu , Uniform Code of Admiralty Conduct , Section Nineteen , due to a state of incapacitation of judgement displayed in multiple encounters under stress , I hereby invoke ... the Transfer of Command ... and relieve you of duty immediately . Officer of the Deck ! Weapon ! Za ! Would you be so kind as to shoot this mutinous Captain dead where he stands . Sorry , Ma 'am . Captain Braca has already relieved you of command . Now , let 's get this ship out of here . Never did ... like Disneyland . Oh ... Dad ... are we there yet ? My head hurts . Let 's go again . From this moment on , you will disregard her status as Ruling Class Scarran ... and ignore Minister Ahkna 's orders . - Am I clear ? ! - Sire . Besides myself , John Crichton is the single most important person on this base . AM I CLEAR ? ! Apprehend him and bring him before me ... now . Your Excellency , you must leave now . It 's the elevator . Did we hit the surface ? I don 't know . Let 's find out . D ... the doors . Secure the Emperor 's safety . You , you and you , with me ! - Alive ! Keep Crichton alive ! - Sire ! General Rahzaro ... it 's Crichton and the others . Be ready . Why is it not working ? Nothing 's working . Let 's find out where we are . Fire ! - Hey ! That 's no good . - Where are we ? - Umm ... conference room . - What ? Come out now ! Or die ! Are we cursed ? - Could we be cursed ? - Well , that depends on whether this will hold . Fire again ! The Rabrokator is quite strong . We can 't stay here forever . What about that hatch ? No . No , it 'll be a drop of at least a metra . Sparky ? Grandma ? Where have you been ? We 're at D 'Argo 's ship and it 's crawling with Scarrans . Here 's our chance to see if Lo 'Lah 's reactivated . Rygel , are you standing near the ship . Well clear . Why ? Hey ! Roshvater ! That did it ! The guards are down . We did it ! We 've reached the Crystherium Chamber . All dead . Hold your positions until reinforcements arrive . I will check on the Emperor ! They are not to leave here ! Grasshopper how important is that mother plant ? I would trade my life ... for its destruction . What about my wormhole debt ? Of course . Ryge ? - Are you in Lo 'Lah ? - Yes Crichton . We 're safe . What have you done , John ? Just fixed your little flower problem . You reactivated it , didn 't you ? Yah . It should go off in about ... - ... sixty microts . - And then it explodes ? Yah . A big explosion ? Oh ... God , we should have voted . All in favor , show of hands . All opposed . Three to two . Sikozu abstains . The concussive pressure must exit through the elevator system . And this shaft . At this distance ... the compartment should protect us . It might work . We 'll find out in fifteen microts . This ... is you last chance . Come out ... now ! - Love you . - Love you too . Emperor ... The Crystheriums are intact . The Matriarch plant has not been harmed . Our fears were completely groundless . Three ... Two ... What is that ? Crichton ! What the hezmana just happened ? Where are you , you fahrbots ? Did you blow up the bomb ? How could you blow up the bomb ? ! You missed the vote . I ... never thought I 'd see you again , Stark . And I always believed I would . It is a pleasure to have you aboard . Time for another starburst , Pilot ? Moya and I believe four is enough . She 's tired and there 's no evidence that anyone is pursuing us . The Scarrans must still be too busy on Katratzi . They got off easy . And to celebrate the victory ... I shall cook a voluptuous Caspitian haunch stew . How long does it take for you to recover ? I do not know . I 've never done this before . Stark ... Everything old is new again . Except the old thing 's getting really old . Hi ... Honey . Guess what I did at work today ? I wore a bomb . A nuclear bomb in a field of flowers . I could get lucky . Tomorrow I could have a bigger bomb . I could kill ... more people . Maybe they 'll be innocent people . Children ... maybe . Subtitles : PK SUB-66

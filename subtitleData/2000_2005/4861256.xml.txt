When we talked , I 'd hoped- - I don 't please you . Hey , flesh . Saffron , it ain 't a question of you pleasing me . It 's more a question of what 's ... . Um ... . Of what 's morally right . I do know my bible , sir . " On the night of their betrothal , the wife shall open to the man ... ... as the furrow to the plow ... ... and he shall work in her in and again ... ... till she bring him to his fall ... ... and rest him then upon the sweat of her breast .

Had I the dare to choose , I 'd choose you ... ... from all the men on all the planets the night sky could show me . If I 'm wed , I am a woman ... ... and I 'II take your leave to be bold . I want this . I swell to think of you in me . And I see that you do too . Oh , that 's just- - Leave me at the nearest port , never look upon me again . I 'II make my way with the strength that you taught me . only let me have my wedding night . Oh , I 'm gonna go to the special hell . I ... .

It 's not Iike anyone else is taking up space . I 've never been off world before . - It 's beautiful , isn 't it ? - It 's like a dream . The planet I 'm from , couldn 't see a one of them , pollution 's so thick . Sometimes I think I entered flight school ... ... just to see what the hell everyone was talking about . What are you doing ? Now we 're alone . Just us and the stars . No ship , no beIIowing engines , no crew to bicker at each other . Look . Do you know the myth of Earth that was ? Not so much . That when she was born , she had no sky ... ... and was open , inviting ... ... and the stars would rush into her ... ... through the skin of her ... ... making the oceans boil with sensation . And when she could endure no more ecstasy ... ... she puffed up her cheeks and blew out the sky . Oh . Good myth . My whole life , I saw nothing but roofs and steeples and the cellar door .

AII we know is , we 're headed somewhere , and it ain 't Beaumond . Oh , I 'm fine . I don 't need to be examined . I 'm comfy . She didn 't just lock it . She fused both entrances to something . But why the big act ? What was she after ? Besides molesting captains . You wanna stow it , preacher ? We 're in some peril here . If she can fly this , why take the shuttle ? Maybe she likes shuttles ? Some people juggle geese . - She 's a pro . - This is a masterful job of muck-up . See how she crossed the dry feeds ? So we even try to re-route , it 'II lock down . - She went straight for the thermal cap . - Yeah , yeah . We are so hung . I 'm glad you 're having a good time . Can we make it right ?

Doesn 't help me to see where I 'm going if I can 't change course . - This girl really knows her ships . - That 's not all she knows . She 's weII-schooIed . What do you mean , the sedative ? The good night kiss ? I only hit my head , but MaI went through that . But , no , I mean , seduction , body language , signals . She 's had training . As in companion . As in academy . Our little Saffron 's quite a wonder . I 'm beginning to think she married beneath herself . How do you know ? About the training ? She tried to seduce me too . really ? Did she- - ? Uh , did you ... ? You don 't play a player . It was sloppy of her to try it , but she was in a rush . But she had professionaI- - So in my case , I mean , it was really ... .

Same coordinates , no ID . Who 's out there ? Let me see if her signal wave can translate to a visual . There might be ... . Yeah . electromagnetic interference . It 's bouncing the signal all over the place . Look at it . It 's like a circle . It 's a net . I don 't get it . Where are we headed ? The end of the line . It 's a carrion house . Scrap shop . Takes ships and pulls them apart , or fixes them up . - Doesn 't sound that scary . - That pattern you 're looking at is a net . We fail into that , we 're helpless . It 'II turn this ship into an electrical conduit and burn us from the inside out . Some of the new ones will just hold you . And then the scrappers will override the air locks , pull the O2 or just gas you . They 're not looking to deal with survivors . One day , you 're gonna tell us how a preacher knows so much about crime . KayIee . - I 'm trying , sir . - Keep on it . We can 't fall into that net . We 're gonna need a plan B. Zoe , get our suits prepped now . I figure we got one shot at this . - Give me a visual , soon as we 're close . - Won 't be long . What do I do ? You go get Vera . She needs oxygen around to fire , and we don 't have a case . Gonna use a suit . Here , we got it . - What am I aiming for , the window ? - That won 't disrupt the net .

Now , Iet 's go visiting . Honey , I 'm home . Looks like you get that wedding night after all . It 's the first time , darling . I think you should be gentle with me . You gonna kill me ? Can you conjure up a compelling reason for me not to ? I didn 't kill you . You handed me and my crew over to those that would kill us . I made you dinner . Why the act ? The seduction games , the dancing about . There has to be an easier way to steal . You 're assuming the payoff is the point . I 'm not assuming anything at this juncture . How 'd you find me ? only a few places that shuttle would make it to from where you left . Happy to find it intact . You 're quite a man , malcolm reynolds . I 've been waiting a Iong time for someone good enough to take me down . Saffron ... ... you even think about playing me again , I will riddle you with holes . Everybody plays each other . That 's all anybody ever does . - We play parts . - You got all kinds of learning . You made me look the fool without trying , yet I have a gun to your head . That 's because I got people with me . people who trust each other and ain 't always looking for the advantage . Promise me you 're gonna kill me soon . You already know I ain 't gonna .

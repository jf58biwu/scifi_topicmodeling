That 's why you might not recognize me . It 's called Blue Ruin . Right . The color . Snappy name , huh ? I like it . This company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names . You 've got Red Menace , Yellow Fever , Green Revolution . That would be a job , coming up with those names . You think there could possibly be a job like that ? I mean , how many hair colors could there be ? 15 maybe ? Someone 's got that job . Agent Orange . I came up with that one . I apply my personality in a paste . I doubt that very much . Well , you don 't know me , so you don 't know , do you ? I 'm sorry . I was just trying to be nice . Yeah . I got it . My name 's Clementine , by the way . I 'm Joel . Hi , Joel . No jokes about my name . Oh , no . You wouldn 't do that . You 're trying to be nice . I don 't know any jokes about your name . Huckleberry Hound . I don 't know what that means . Huckleberry Hound ? What are you , nuts ? It 's been suggested . Oh , my darling , oh , my darling Oh , my darling Clementine You are lost and gone forever Dreadful sorry , Clementine No ? I 'm sorry . It 's a pretty name , though . It really is nice . It means merciful , right ? Clemency ? Although it hardly fits . I 'm a vindictive little bitch , truth be told . I wouldn 't think that about you . Why wouldn 't you think that about me ? I don 't know . You seem nice . Now I 'm nice ? Oh , God , don 't you know any other adjectives ? I don 't need nice . I don 't need myself to be it and I don 't need anybody to be it at me . Okay . It 's Joel , right ? Yes . I 'm sorry I yelled at you . I 'm a little out of sorts today . My embarrassing admission is I really like that you 're nice right now . I can 't tell from one moment to the next what I 'm going to like , but right now I 'm glad you are . I have some stuff that I probably should ... I 'm writing ... I 'm sorry . Okay . No . Sure . That 's okay . Take care , then . Jesus . I could give you a ride if you need . It 's cold . Yeah ! Okay . It is frosty . You 're not a stalker or anything , right ? I 'm not a stalker . You 're the one that talked to me , remember ? That is the oldest trick in the stalker book . Really ? There 's a stalker book ? I 've got to read that one . Look , I 'm sorry if I came off sort of nutso . I 'm not really . That 's okay . I didn 't think you were . Do you want to have a drink ? I have lots of drinks , and I could ... Never mind . Sorry , that was stupid . I 'm embarrassed now . Good night , Joel . Two Blue Ruins . Thank you . Drink up , young man . It 'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant . I 'm just kidding ! Come on . You 're kind of close-mouthed , aren 't you ? I 'm sorry . You know , my life isn 't that interesting . I go to work , I come home . I don 't know what to say . You should read my journal . I mean , it 's just blank . Really ? Does that make you sad or anxious ? I 'm always anxious , thinking I 'm not living my life to the fullest . Taking advantage of every possibility and making sure I 'm not wasting one second of the little time I have . I think about that . Yeah ? You 're really nice . God , I have to stop saying that . I 'm gonna marry you . I know it . Okay . Joel , you should come up to the Charles with me sometime . It gets frozen this time of year . That sounds scary . Exactly . I 'll pack a picnic , a night picnic . Night picnics are different . That sounds good . But I should go now . You should stay . No , I really have ... I have to get up so early and ... I would like you to call me . Would you do that ? I 'd like it . Yes . Wish me a happy Valentine 's Day when you call . That 'd be nice . What took you so long ? I just walked in . You miss me ? Oddly enough , I do . You said " I do . " I guess that means we 're married . I guess so . Tomorrow night ? Honeymoon on ice ? It 's really solid this time of year . I don 't know . Come on . It 's so beautiful . Isn 't it ? Don 't go too far . Are you okay ? Oh , my ass ! I think I should go back . Come on ! But what if it breaks ? " What if ? " Do you really care right now ? Come here , please . Slidey-slidey . This looks good . Let me show you this one thing . What are you doing ? Come on . Think I heard a crack . It 's not going to crack . Or break . It 's so thick . Show me which constellations you know . I don 't know any . Show me which ones you know . Okay . There 's Osidius . Where ? Right there . See ? A sort of a swoop and a cross . Osidius the Emphatic . You 're full of shit , right ? No . Osidius , right there . Swoop and a cross . Shut the fuck up ! Cock-a-doodle-doo . Sorry to wake you , but we 're here . Can I come over to your house , to sleep ? I 'm so tired . Okay . Yeah , sure . Let me get my toothbrush . Yes ? Can I help you ? What do you mean ? Can I help you with something ? No . What are you doing here ? I 'm not really sure what you 're asking me . Thanks . We 're looking for 150 . What number is that ? I don 't know what number that is . Jesus Christ . You 'd think they 'd light the number or at least put a number on ... Is that him ? I think so . Yeah , that 's him . That 's him . Hey , Joel . Frank . Shit . Jesus . The only Valentine 's Day cards I get are from my mother . How pathetic is that ? You 're lucky you have Clementine . She is way cool . You got any big Valentine 's Day plans with her ? No . It 's only a day away . Better make some reservations or something . Don 't want to end up at Mickey D 's , right ? McRomance ! You want some fries with that shake ? I have to go to sleep now , Frank . It 's 8 : 30 . Patrick , stop it . Okay . Showtime at the Apollo . Quiet . Get it off your head . Hey , Joel . What 's up ? Hi , Frank . I only get Valentine 's Day cards from my mom . How pathetic is that ? You 're lucky you have Clementine , Joel . You got any big Valentine 's Day plans with her ? No . It 's only a day away . Better make a reservation somewhere . Don 't want to end up at Mickey D 's . Oh , no . Yes . Valentine 's Day is three days away . I want it resolved . I 'm willing to be the one to resolve it . So I call her , and she 's changed her number . So I walked over to Antic Attic to get her something . I thought I 'd go over to work , give her an early Valentine . And you won 't believe it . She 's there with this guy , this really young guy . And she looks at me like she doesn 't even know who I am . Excuse me ? Can I help you find something , sir ? Hey , Clem-ato . Patrick ! Baby boy ! What are you doing here , baby ? Just came to surprise you . Let me know if you need something , sir . How are you ? Pretty good , pretty bored , pretty tired . I so want what 's in your suit . Good . Why would she do that to me ? Does anybody want a joint ? God , Rob , give it a rest . God , she 's punishing me . I know . For being honest . It 's horrible . I should just go to her house . No . You don 't want to go there , man . Get off me . It 's too ... Right . Yeah . I don 't want to seem desperate . Joel , why don 't you just see this as a sign ? Make a clean break . Right ? All right , Joel . Look , man , seriously , here 's the deal . Don 't do that . Rob , what are you doing ? What 's your fucking suggestion ? What 's your brilliant , reasoned solution ? You 're making this about our shit now ? This isn 't about us . I agree . It 's not about us . It 's about Joel , who 's an adult , okay ? Not Mama Carrie 's kid . Why don 't you go do your laundry ? That 's great . That 's good . Okay . What is it ? I don 't know . It 's some place that does a thing . Good morning . Lacuna . No , I 'm sorry . That offer expired after the New Year . Yeah , sure . We can fit you in ... How about on the 5th ? That 's a Wednesday . All right , great . Could you spell that , please ? Okay , and we 'll need a daytime phone number . Great . Have a nice day . See you then . May I help you ? I 'm Joel Barish . Excuse me ? I 'm Joel Barish . I have an appointment with Doctor ... Mierzwiak . Here , can you please fill this out ? I just want to talk to him . You still need to fill the form out , sir . All right . Thank you . I don 't have a pen . There 's a pen right there . Good morning . Lacuna . Yeah , that offer , that 's done now . That expired after the New Year . Mr. Barish ? How are we today ? Not too good , actually . Oh , my God ! Stan ! Sorry , I was just ... I 'm working . Here , Doctor . Thank you . You should not have seen this . I apologize . This is a hoax , right ? I mean , this is Clem 's ... I assure you , no . No . There 's no such thing as this . Look , our files are confidential , Mr. Barish , so I can 't show you evidence . Suffice it to say that Miss Kruczynski was not happy and she wanted to move on . We provide that possibility . " Miss Kruczynski was not happy and wanted to move on . " We provide that possibility . " What the hell is that ? I 'm the nicest guy she ever went out with . Fuck ! Rob , give it a rest ! It 's okay . It 's all right . Carrie , I am making a birdhouse . What can I say ? You know , Clementine 's just like that . She 's impulsive . She decided to erase you almost as a lark . A lark ? Why did you do that ? Don 't . Wait . I 'm sorry , Doctor , he just barged right in here . Okay . I want it done . I told him pre-Valentine 's Day is our busy time ... That 's okay , Mary . But there are people waiting . Mr. Barish , if you 'd like to come inside . If you 'd take care of Mrs. Woo . Yes , of course . Goodbye , Mrs. Woo . The first thing we need you to do , Mr. Barish , is to go home and collect everything you own that has some association with Clementine . Anything . We 'll use these items to create a map of Clementine in your brain , okay ? We 'll need photos , clothing , gifts , books she may have bought you , CDs you may have bought together , journal entries . We want to empty your home , we want to empty your life of Clementine . And after the mapping is done , our technicians will do the erasing in your home tonight . That way , when you awake in the morning , you 'll find yourself in your own bed as if nothing had happened , a new life awaiting you . Wake up , buddy ! I 'm sorry , Mrs. Sobel . You can 't have the procedure done three times in one month . It 's just not our policy here . How are you today , Mr. Barish ? Hello , I 'm right here . I know it 's an emergency . We 'll do everything we can . We can fit you in on March 1 . Maybe you could talk to the doctor and ... All right , so let 's make an appointment . What day would you like to come in this week ? Mr. Barish . He 's really busy this afternoon . Maybe tomorrow would be better , around 12 : 15 . Can you do that ? February is very busy for us because of Valentine 's Day . This is Stan Fink , one of our most experienced and skilled technicians . He 'll be handling your case tonight . Great to meet you , Mr. Barish . My name is Joel Barish , and I 'm here to erase Clementine Kruczynski . Very good . Now tell me about Clementine . I was living with this woman , Naomi , a couple years ago . And my friends , Rob and Carrie , invited us to this party at the beach . I don 't like parties . Naomi couldn 't go , but I went and I met Clementine . I 'm sorry . We 'll start with your most recent memories and work backwards from there , more or less . There 's an emotional core to each of our memories , and when you eradicate that core , it starts its degradation process . By the time you wake up in the morning , all the memories we 've targeted will have withered and disappeared . As in a dream upon waking . Is there any risk of brain damage ? Technically speaking , the procedure is brain damage . But it 's on a par with a night of heavy drinking . Nothing you 'll miss . Comfortable ? What we 're doing here , Mr. Barish , is actually creating a map of your brain . Okay , let 's get started . If we want to get this procedure underway tonight , we have some work to do . I want you to react to these objects , Mr. Barish , if you will . There 's a good story behind that ... Actually , Mr. Barish , I 'll get a much better emotional read-out if you refrain from any sort of verbal description of the items . Just please try to focus on the memories . I 'm sorry . Healthy activity up there again . Healthy read-outs . Very good . Here 's another object . Next item . Potato head . Next item . Just focus on the memories . Patrick , do me a favor . Patrick , do me a favor , will you ? Can you check the voltage regulator ? What have we got there ? Voltage looks fine . Really ? I 'm not wiping as clean as I like here . Technically , the procedure is brain damage . But it 's on a par with a night of heavy drinking . Check the connections , please . There you are . What am I ... I don 't understand what I 'm looking at . Why am I standing here ... Oh , my God , deja vu . This is so ... We should get started . If we want to get the procedure underway tonight , we have some work to do . I 'm in my head already , aren 't I ? I suppose so . This is about right . This is what it would look like . Very good . We 'll dispose of these mementos when we 're done here . That way you won 't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home . There we go . Patrick ? Patrick ? Patrick ? Why are there so many wires ? Because we have a lot of equipment . Does that help ? Are you sure you set that thing up properly ? How 's that ? How are you today , Mr. Barish ? There we are , Mr. Barish . All right , that 's better . I don 't know if I like this . I think I might try this then . We 're almost done now . Yourjournal . That 'll be invaluable . " I met someone tonight . I don 't know what to do . " Her name is Clementine and she 's amazing . " Jesus ! What ? Come on , careful ! Step back ! Just take it easy . It 's fine . Let 's not roach the guy . All right . We got that one . This place is sort of a dump , don 't you think ? It 's an apartment , Patrick . Well , not a dump then , but sort of plain . Uninspired . And there 's sort of a stale smell . Can we just please get through this ? We 've got a long night ahead of us . This is the last time I saw you . It 's 3 : 00 . I kind of , sort of wrecked your car . Driving drunk . It 's pathetic . I was a little tipsy . Don 't call me pathetic ! It is pathetic . It 's fucking irresponsible . You could have killed somebody . Maybe you did kill somebody . Should we turn on the news and see ? Should I check the grille to see if there 's children or small animals ? It 's just a fucking dent . You 're like an old lady or something . What are you like ? A wino ? A " wino " ? Jesus . Are you from the ' 50s or something ? A " wino " ? Face it , Joely . You 're freaked out because I was out late without you . And in your little , wormy brain , you 're trying to figure out , " Did she fuck someone tonight ? " Now , see , Clem , I assume you fucked someone tonight . Isn 't that how you get people to like you ? I 'm sorry , okay ? Clem , I didn 't mean it , all right ? Your keys . I won 't need them anymore . I was just angry or annoyed or something . I don 't know . Got it . Mary 's coming over tonight . Just thought you 'd want to know . I like Mary . I like when she comes to visit . I don 't think she likes me . She likes you okay . So maybe I should invite my girlfriend over . I have a girlfriend now . Do whatever you want . Did I tell you ... Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend ? We gotta focus here , Patrick . The thing is , my situation is a little weird . My girlfriend situation . I 'm sure it is . You 've got to be ... Clem , let me drive you home . Get out of my face , faggot ! Look at it out here ! It 's all falling apart ! I 'm erasing you , and I 'm happy ! You did it to me first ! I can 't believe you did this to me ! God damn it ! Did you hear me ? By morning you 'll be gone ! The perfect ending to this piece-of-shit story ! Is there something wrong with a girl being attracted to me ? Is that a problem ? No , I think it 's funny . Who do you think 's better-looking , me or this guy ? Patrick , let 's focus , buddy . Remember that girl we did last week ? The one with the potatoes ? That girl ? Yeah , that 's this guy 's girl . Right , was . We took care of that . I kind of fell in love with her that night . What ? You little fuck . What ? She was unconscious , man . She was beautiful . I stole a pair of her panties , as well . Jesus ! What ? It 's not like ... I mean , they were clean and all . Don 't tell me this . I don 't want to hear this shit . They were clean . What ? Don 't . Stop . Okay , all right . We 've got work to do . Hold my papers . There 's more . After we did her , I kind of asked her out . What ? Jesus . ... how unethical ... It 's not really that bad . Get that look off your face . What 's wrong ? Patrick , you stole a girl 's panties . There 's someone here . He stole your underwear . I don 't see anyone . Joel , where are my boots ? Now , why are you showing me poisons ? Can 't you understand English ? Potions , I said . Potions . Love potion , please . I 'm fucking crawling out of my skin ! I should have left you at the flea market . Want to go ? I want to have a baby . Let 's talk about it later . No . I want to have a baby . I don 't think we 're ready . You 're not ready . Clem , do you really think you could take care of a kid ? What ? I don 't want to talk about it here . I can 't hear you . I can never the fuck understand what you 're saying . I said I don 't want to talk about this ! We 're fucking gonna talk about it ! You can 't just say that and say you don 't wanna talk about it . I 'm sorry . I 'd make a fucking good mother . I love children . I 'm creative , I 'm smart , and I 'd make a fucking great mother ! It 's you , Joel . It 's you who can 't commit to anything . It 's going . You 've no idea how lucky you are I 'm interested in you . I don 't even know why I am . Maybe I should end it right here ! Leave you at the flea market with the stupid costume jewelry ! Maybe you can find a nice antique rocking chair to die in ! Hi , Patrick . Hi , Mary , how 's it going ? Hey , you . It 's freezing outside . Did you find us okay ? Yeah . Hot . Poor guy . Don 't you have anything real to drink ? We haven 't checked yet . Let me do the honors . Mary hates me . Never really had much luck with the ladies . Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties . There 's more . No . Yes . No . You didn 't want any , did you , Patrick ? No , I don 't know . That 's okay . Wait . " Blessed are the forgetful , " for they get the better even of their blunders . " That 's Nietzsche . Beyond Good and Evil . I found it in my Bartlett 's . What 's your Bartlett 's ? It 's a quote book , Patrick . It 's a book of quotations . I think Howard will be in Bartlett 's one day . Definitely . Howard is pure Bartlett 's . Can you wake him up ? You can 't wake him up . You don 't tell me things , Joel . I 'm an open book . I tell you everything . Every damn embarrassing thing . You don 't trust me . Constantly talking isn 't necessarily communicating . I don 't do that . I want to know you . I don 't constantly talk . Jesus . People have to share things , Joel . That 's what intimacy is . I 'm really pissed that you said that to me . I 'm sorry . My life just isn 't that interesting . I wanna read some of those journals you 're constantly scribbling in . What do you write if you don 't have any thoughts or passions or love ? " November 19 , 2003 . " Dinner at Kang 's again . " Are we like those poor couples " you feel sorry for in restaurants ? " Are we the dining dead ? " I can 't stand the idea of us being a couple people think that about . I like that . How 's the chicken ? Good . More ? No , thank you . She 's going to be drunk and stupid now . Would you do me a favor and clean the goddamn hair off the soap when you 're done in the shower ? It 's really ... Yeah . It 's gross . Gross . I think it 's just ... Repulsive . It 's repulsive . Patrick , can we get through this ? Hey , Tangerine . Patrick , it 's you . I 'm so miserable right now . Why ? What 's wrong ? I don 't know . I 'm just confused about everything . Confused ? What are you confused about ? Everything 's fine . Do you love me ? Of course I do . Where 's the self-help section ? Do you think I 'm ugly ? No . You 're beautiful . Maybe I should come over . No . I don 't know . I 'm a mess , Patrick . Just let me come over . I 'll cheer you up . Okay . Can I leave for a while ? My girlfriend 's really upset . We 're right in the middle of erasing this poor man 's ... Let him go , Stan . I 'll help . See ? How hard can it be ? She hates me . She wants me to go . Go . All right . I 'll be right over , Tangerine . You like ? I matched my sweatshirt exactly . I like it . You do ? You look like a tangerine . Clementine the tangerine . Juicy and seedless . I like that . I like tangerines . Can you see me doing ducks ? Tangerine . How does he know to call you that ? How did who know ? Oh , my God . Clem ? This is pretty cool . That 's what they called themselves . The Clash , the only band that mattered . And they called themselves that for a reason . It 's amazing , isn 't it ? Like social justice . Yeah , it 's totally incredible . What Howard gives to the world . Yeah . To let people begin again . It 's beautiful . You look at a baby , and it 's so pure and so free and so clean . Adults are this mess of sadness and phobias . And Howard just makes it all go away . Baby , what 's going on ? I don 't know . I 'm lost , I 'm scared , I feel like I 'm disappearing . My skin 's coming off ! I 'm getting old ! Nothing makes any sense to me ! You 're not getting old . Nothing makes any sense . Tangerine . It 's okay . Let 's go out dancing . You want to go out to Montauk with me ? Montauk ? No , come up to Boston with me . Sure . We can go next weekend . No , now . I have to go now . I have to see the frozen Charles now . Hi , it 's Joel . Leave a message after the beep and I 'll get back to you . Pick up . Hello ? What 's up ? I got into a little situation with the old lady . Can you handle things tonight alone ? I 'm really sorry . Don 't worry about it . I 've got it under control . He 's pretty much on auto-pilot now , anyway . Thanks . I owe you big-time . Dude , I got to go . " Look . You and me on the Charles River . " I could die right now , Clem . I 'm just happy . " I 've never felt that before . I 'm exactly where I want ... " I 'm so excited . I 'm excited , too . Cool . I got you this thing . Happy early Valentine 's Day . Thank you . What is it ? I don 't know . Open it up . It 's gorgeous . You like it ? It 's just my taste , really . God , I 've never gone out with a guy who bought me jewelry I liked . Thank you . Let 's go . Okay . Joely ? Yeah , Tangerine ? Am I ugly ? When I was a kid , I thought I was . Can 't believe I 'm crying already . Sometimes I think people don 't understand how lonely it is to be a kid . Like you don 't matter . So , I 'm eight , and I have these toys , these dolls . My favorite is this ugly girl doll who I call Clementine . And I keep yelling at her , " You can 't be ugly . Be pretty . " It 's weird . Like if I can transform her , I would magically change , too . You 're pretty . Don 't ever leave me . You 're pretty . Mierzwiak , please let me keep this memory . Just this one . I don 't want to hold your hand . Come on . Stop it ! I could die right now . I 'm just so happy . I 've never felt that before . I 'm just exactly where I want to be . I want to call it off . I 'll give you a sign . I want to call it off . Can you hear me ? I don 't want this anymore ! I want to call it off ! Is anybody there ? What ? We 've got to go . Where ? I have an idea of how to stop this . Stop what ? Don 't tickle me . No . Smell my pits ! Concentrate , Clem . We have to get back to the office . Halloween . There was a tape recorder . No , not the picture . Back here . Come on . Look at me . I want to go there . Our files are confidential , so I can 't show you evidence . Suffice it to say that Miss Kruczynski was not happy and she wanted to move on . Tell me about ... Tell me everything you remember . That 's what he said . What did we see that day ? We 're going to see my grandma . Shit ! Joel , why ... No . We 're not going on a train . Joel , please . Don 't make me run anymore . Come on . Mierzwiak ! Do we always have to run ? Please ? Why don 't we begin by you telling me everything you can remember ... Mierzwiak , wake me up ! I 'm sorry , Mr. Barish , I thought you understood what was going on . You 're erasing her from me . You 're erasing me from her . You got this thing . I 'm in my bed . I know it . I 'm in my brain . I 'm part of your imagination , too . How can I help you from there ? I 'm inside your head , too . I 'm you . Sorry . Look , who 's that ? He works for us . That 's Patrick , baby boy . He 's stealing my identity . He stole my stuff . He 's seducing my girlfriend with my words and my things . He stole her underwear . Jesus Christ . He stole her underwear . I could die right now , Clem . I 'm just happy . I 've never felt that before . I 'm exactly where I want to be . I want to go home . What ? Wait , Clem . Clem , they 're erasing you . Over here ! Clem , focus . I hired them , okay ? I 'm sorry . I 'm so stupid . Sweetie , calm down . Enjoy the scenery . I need it to stop before I wake up and don 't know you anymore . Just tell them to cancel it then . What the hell are you talking about ? I can 't just cancel it . I 'm asleep . Wake yourself up ! Okay , you want me to wake up ? All right . Okay , here we go . Will it make you happy if I try ? Yeah . I 'll try really hard . Here we go . That was a great idea . That 's working like gangbusters . Don 't ! That tickles me ! What the hell is that ? It 's a birthmark ! It did work , for a second . But I couldn 't ... See ? I couldn 't move . Isn 't that just another one of Joel 's self-fulfilling prophecies ? It 's more important to prove me wrong than to actually ... I don 't want to discuss this right now , okay ? Fine . Then what ? I 'm listening . I don 't know . You erased me . That 's why I 'm here and doing this . I 'm sorry . You know me , I 'm impulsive . That 's what I love about you . I have another idea for this problem . This is a memory of me . The way you wanted to have sex on the couch after you look down at my crotch . The eraser guys are coming , so what if you take me somewhere else , somewhere where I don 't belong , and we hide there till morning ? I can 't remember anything without you . That 's very sweet , but try , okay ? Okay . Row , row , row your boat Gently down the stream Merrily , merrily , merrily , merrily Life is but a dream It 's working . I 'm a genius . Where did you go ? I 'm supposed to come , too ! I 'm just gonna go get a salad bowl . Can you stir the soup and keep an eye on Joel ? He likes to be near me . Absolutely . It worked . My God , look at this . It worked ! Look at this dress , man . I wish I could take it with me . Who am I ? Mrs. Hamlyn . Right . Mrs. Hamlyn . I must be about four . Oh , my gosh . Found the salad bowl . I 'm serving salad and string beans . Is he okay under there ? Honey , are you all right ? I feel like I could clean up all day . Would you hate me if I asked you to clean some string beans ? No , not at all . God , I love this kitchen . Thank you so much . She 's not looking at me . She 's busy . No one ever looks at me . I want my mommy . Oh , baby Joel . Is every little peanut under there okay ? He 's fine . Do you have something to drink ? How about a cocktail ? I know it 's not 5 : 00 ... I would die for a vodka . Let me check if I have that . Okay , I 'm just going to wait right here . No , sweetie . Joely ? Your mother wants me to mind you . Get back under the table . Ice cream . No , not until after you 've had your dinner . Come on ! Grow up . Don 't leave me , Clem . Oh , my God . No , I 'm right here . This is sort of warped . I 'm scared . I want my mommy . Don 't cry , baby Joel . It 's okay . Joel , stop it ! I think it 's working . We 're hidden , Joel . Look ! Honey , look . Wait there . My crotch is still here , just as you remembered it . Yuck . It stopped . What ? It stopped erasing . Oh , shit ! This is terrible . He 's off the map . Where ? I don 't know where . This is very bad news . Where are my glasses ? Crap ! What did we do ? What do I do ? What shall we do ? I don 't know what to do . What shall we do ? I just said , I don 't know . I 'm sorry . What shall we do ? I don 't know . Mellow out . You 're freaking me out . We have to do something . He could wake up all half-baked . Quiet . You 're freaking me out . All gooey and half-baked . That sounds so good . I 'm hungry . Oh , shit . What ? We should call Howard . No way . No sir , man . This is my ... I can handle this . You can 't call Howard . There 's no time to fuck around . I 've got this under control . What are you talking about ? Stop fucking around . Okay . I 'll call Howard . Hello ? Howard , it 's Stan . I 'm working on this guy down here . We 've lost him for a moment , and I can 't bring him back up . Okay , tell me what happened before he disappeared . I wasn 't sure because I was away from the monitor for a minute , and I had it on auto-pilot because I had to pee . Where was Patrick ? He had to go home sick . What 's the address ? I know , I 'm so sorry . That 's okay . Come on . We 're at 159 South Village . Apartment 1-E . Rockville Center . Mary , he 's coming right now . I 'm staying . Get your stuff , Mary . I think you should go . No . I am so stoned . Please , Mary , you have to go . Stop being stoned . I don 't want him to see me stoned . You have no idea how much trouble I 'll get into if Howard comes ... Joel , stop . Look . I want her to pick me up . Weird how strong that desire is . Joel , look at me . You 'll remember me in the morning , you 'll come to me , you 'll tell me about us , and we 'll start over . Pat ? I thought we could have a little cocktail . That Patrick guy , he 's copying me . What Patrick guy ? That guy . What ? He 's here , in my apartment . One of the eraser guys . He fell for you when they were doing you , and now he 's introduced himself like he doesn 't even know you , and you guys are dating . Really ? Is he cute ? There 's nothing wrong with you . You 're the most wonderful person I 've ever met . You 're kind , beautiful , smart , funny , and nice . What ? Okay , all right . Move . Come on , let 's go . Careful . I 'm still stoned . Those eye drops you gave me didn 't do shit . Be cool . Hello , Mary , what are you doing here ? Hi , Howard . She was just here to help out . I wanted to understand as much about the procedure as possible . I think it 's important for my job to understand the inner workings of the work that we do . Not that I do , but the work that is done by people where I also work . The work of my colleagues . Let 's see if we can get to the bottom of this , shall we ? That 's odd . I already tried that . You tried going through the C-gate ? Of course . I mean , yes . All right . You want to get linked up ? Yeah . I ran the utility programs , and I had nothing there , so I checked all the memories against the printed logs . Here , Howard , I got you a chair . Thank you . There you go . You 're welcome . All right . I 've got it . I 'll go through the entire memory , see if something comes up . I love being bathed in the sink . Such a feeling of security . I 've never seen you happier , baby Joel . There it is . I don 't understand why it 's off the map like that . What the heck was he doing there ? His eyes are open . Has this happened before with him ? No . This is not good . I 'm going to have to give him this . Can 't you see I love you , Antoine ? Okay , we 're back in . That was beautiful to watch , Howard , like a surgeon or a concert pianist . Thank you , Mary . Howard , you should get some sleep . I think I 'll be fine now . Can 't you see I love you , Antoine ? Lucky me . Lay one on me . Don 't call me Antoine . My name is Wally . Yes , I know , but how can a woman love a man with a name like Wally ? What was that ? My God , there 's people coming out of your butt . There is ? Got it . Tangerine ! Come on . We 've got to go . Go on . Please go . You can run , but you can 't hide . Clem , come on ! There I am . That truck . Doc ? Please ! Let 's begin by you telling me everything you remember ... That 's strange . He 's in a memory that we 've already erased . At least we know where he is . He 's back on track , right ? Come on , Clem . He 's developed some sort of resistance to the procedure . I don 't want to run anymore . Shit . Come on . Hide me somewhere deeper , somewhere really buried . Where ? Hide me in your humiliation . Humiliation . Come on , you big baby . No ! Bye , Howard . Wait . He 's disappeared again . Oh , dear . I 'm so sorry , Howard . Humiliation . I don 't like it , either . I 'm trying to find horrible secret places to ... Honey , I have a surprise . You know what ? I 'll just ask you in the morning . Good night . I 'm sorry . Shut up . Look . Joel , look where we are . This isn 't good . Then hide me somewhere really buried . Hit it , Joel ! I can 't , I 've got to go home . I 'll do it later ! He has a girlfriend . Wait , what am I doing ? Freddy , you don 't scare me anymore . Joely , get up . Come on , it 's not worth it . They 're not worth it , Joel . He 's not listening ! Come on . Stupid ! I 'm so ashamed . It 's okay . You were a little kid . Come on . That 's where I live , lived . I wish I knew you when I was a kid . Do you like my pink hat ? Here , look , feel better . You can really kill me this time . It 's my turn . Go . You 're really going to die , though , okay ? One , two , three . You 're dead . My mom . It 's okay , we 're playing . It 's not real . He 's killing me . Are you dead yet ? You 're dead ! I think I got the hang of this . I still don 't understand it , but I 'm finding him quickly enough . Are you okay ? Oh , my God , that was terrible . Almost three seconds . Let 's do it one more time . One more and then I get to go . This is so cool ! Look out ! It 's fluff . Our house . Wait , we 've got to go . Come on . This is a really bad time for this . I don 't even know where we 're going . It 's going to be fun . It 's the best place . No , this way . This way . Come on . You 're no help at all . Come on . Let go of me , Joel . I like watching you work , Howard . I guess I 'll go out for some air , if nobody minds . It looks like you have everything under control here . Yeah , that 's fine . Do you like quotes , Howard ? What do you mean ? Like famous quotes . I find reading them inspirational , and in my reading , I 've come across some I thought you might like , too . I 'd love to hear some . There 's one that goes , " Blessed are the forgetful , " for they get the better even of their blunders . " That 's Nietzsche , right ? Yeah . I thought I could tell you something you didn 't know . No , it 's a good quote . I 'm happy we both know it . There 's this other one I like . It 's by Pope Alexander and it goes ... Alexander Pope ? Oh , yeah . Shit . It 's just that I told myself not to say " Pope Alexander " and sound like a dope , and then I go ahead and say it . It 's no big deal . You 're such a sweetheart . The quote goes , " How happy is the blameless vestal 's lot ! " The world forgetting by the world forgot " Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind ! " Each pray 'r accepted and each wish resign 'd " I want to be a great , big , huge elephant . With a huge trunk like that . I haven 't heard that one . It 's lovely . I just thought it would be appropriate , maybe . I really admire the work you do . I don 't mean to be so familiar ... It 's fine . I 'm happy to hear ... I 'm sorry . I 've loved you for a very long time . I shouldn 't have said that . Mary , you 're a wonderful girl . But , you know , I have a wife and kids . Mary , we can 't do this . Good morning , Mrs. Mierzwiak . What ? Who is it ? Oh , my God . Thank you , Stan . Thanks a lot . Hollis ! Wait . I knew it , Howard . It didn 't start out like this . I came here to work . This is a one-time mistake . I 'm a stupid girl with a crush . I basically forced him into it . Don 't be a monster . Tell the girl . Tell me what ? Oh , you poor kid . You can have him . You did . What ? We have a history . I 'm sorry . You wanted the procedure . You wanted it done so you could get past ... I have to finish the work in there . It 's almost morning . We 'll talk later , okay ? Let me give you a lift home . Didn 't figure you 'd show your face around me again . I thought you were humiliated . You did run away , after all . I just needed to see you . Yeah ? I 'd like to take you out or something . You 're married . Not yet . Not married . No , I 'm not married . Look , I 'm telling you right off the bat , I 'm high maintenance , so I 'm not gonna tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you 've got going there . If you want to be with me , you 're with me . Okay . Too many guys think I 'm a concept , or I complete them or I 'm gonna make them alive . I 'm just a fucked-up girl who 's looking for my own peace of mind . Don 't assign me yours . I remember that speech really well . I had you pegged , didn 't I ? Had the whole human race pegged . Probably . I still thought you were going to save my life . Even after that . I know . It would be different , if we could just give it another go-round . Remember me . Try your best . Maybe we can . Just tell me what you remember , and we 'll take it from there . I liked you immediately . You didn 't come on to me at all . I liked that . I was so tongue-tied around you at first , but I wanted you to think I was smart . I couldn 't wait to come to work . I had these fantasies of us being married and having kids ... Howie , I can 't do this . We agreed it 's for the best , Mary . Yeah , I know . Oh , God ! I 'll take the bottom and you ... No , Joel , help me with that . Will you get the cooler ? Honey , the cooler 's pretty ... She can get it . Let me get that . No , no , no . Don 't take anything . I can take the plane . Put the gate back up . This is the day we met . You were by the surf . I could just make you out in the distance . I remember being drawn to you , even then . I thought , " Wow , how odd ! " I 'm drawn to someone 's back . " You were in that orange sweatshirt that I would come to know so well , and even hate , eventually . But at the time I thought , " How cool , an orange sweatshirt . " Hi , there . Hi . I saw you sitting over here by yourself , and I thought , " Thank God , " someone normal who doesn 't know how to interact at these things . " I don 't ever know what to say . I 'm Clementine . Can I borrow a piece of your chicken ? And then you just took it , without waiting for an answer . It was so intimate , like we were already lovers . I 'm Joel . Hi , Joel . So , no jokes about my name . You mean , like " Oh , my darlin ' , Clementine ? " Huckleberry Hound ? That sort of thing ? Yeah , like that . No , no jokes . One of my favorite things when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll . I think your name is magical . This is it , Joel . It 's gonna be gone soon . I know . What do we do ? Enjoy it . You married ? No . Let 's move into this neighborhood ! I do sort of live with someone , though . Male or female ? What ? Female . At least I 'm not barking up the wrong tree . Do you know these people ? No , of course not . Come on . They might have a dog . There 's no dog . What are you doing ? It 's freezing out . I don 't believe this . Come on , man . The water 's fine . Nobody 's coming here tonight , believe me . So , what 's your girlfriend 's name ? Naomi , but we 're not really ... Whatever . So this is great . Now I can look for candles , matches , and the liquor cabinet . Oh , God . I think we should go . There 's no phone line . What ? I think we should go . Why ? It 's our house . Just for tonight . We are David and Ruth Laskin . Which one do you want to be ? I prefer to be Ruth , but I can be flexible . What do you need ? Alcohol . So , are you okay with wine ? I don 't know . Well , you choose the wine . I 'll go find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth . I 'm Ruth-less at the moment . We really should go . I 've got to catch my ride . So go . I did . I thought maybe you were a nut . But you were exciting . I wish you 'd stayed . I wish I 'd stayed , too . Now I wish I 'd stayed . I wish I 'd done a lot of things . I wish I 'd stayed . I do . I came back downstairs and you were gone . I walked out the door . Why ? I don 't know . I felt like a scared little kid . It was above my head . You were scared ? Yeah . I thought you knew that about me . I ran back to the bonfire , trying to outrun my humiliation . Was it something I said ? Yeah . You said " So go " with such disdain . I 'm sorry . It 's okay . What if you stayed this time ? I walked out the door . There 's no memory left . Come back and make up a goodbye . Let 's pretend we had one . Bye , Joel . I love you . Meet me in Montauk . I didn 't crash the plane . The plane crashed . You were operating the plane with the remote control , and it crashed . It was fucking windy . Come on . You 're stoned and you 're driving . The pot balances it out and brings you back up . That 's why I smoke it . If I 'm going to be drinking , then I 'll smoke it . It does . A medical test was done . It 's proven on the Science Network . Honey , just watch the road . I can 't see shit . I saw you talking to a pretty girl . She was nice . Yeah , man , who was it ? She was just a girl . Okay . So I 've got to drop the van off . Thanks , Stan . We 'll talk . You 've got all your stuff , I see . That 's right . I take it you 're not coming back . I wouldn 't come back if I was you . Do you swear you didn 't know ? I swear . So you didn 't do the erasing ? Of course not . God , no . And you never even suspected we were together ? Once , maybe . I was coming back from a job , and you were at his car , and I saw you two talking . So I waved to you , and you giggled . How did I look ? You looked happy . Happy with a secret . And after that ? I never saw you two together again like that , so I just figured I was imagining things . I really like you , Mary Svevo . You know that ? Thanks . Let me get my toothbrush . Where are you , Clem ? I 'm worried . I feel like you 're mad at me and I don 't know what I did . What did I do ? I love you so much . I 'll do anything to make you happy . Just tell me what you want me to do , and I 'll do it . I 'm going to stop by this morning , just to make sure you 're okay . Let 's go , mister . I had a really nice time last night . Nice ? I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life last night . That 's better . This is weird . " To all patients of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak . " My name is Mary Svevo . " We 've met , but you don 't remember me . " I worked for a company you hired to have part of your memory erased . " I 've since decided that this is a horrible ... " To correct this , I 'm sending everyone 's file back to them . " My name is Clementine Kruczynski . I 'm here to erase Joel Barish . What is this ? I don 't know . He 's boring . Is that enough reason to erase someone ? I 've been thinking how I was before and how I am now , and he changed me . I feel like I 'm always pissy now . I don 't like myself when I 'm with him . I don 't like myself anymore . I can 't stand to even look at him . That pathetic , wimpy , apologetic smile . That sort of wounded puppy shit . What are you doing ? I 'm not doing anything . The bloom is certainly off the rose at this point . Are you screwing with me ? No ! You are screwing with me . Joel , I 'm not ! You clearly are ! Let 's just take a minute and ... Patrick , get the fuck away from me ! Can we talk about it ? No , get the fuck away ! Hey , Clementine . Nice to see you . I mean , she 's smart , I think , but not educated . I couldn 't talk to her about books . She 's more of a magazine-reading girl . Her vocabulary leaves something to be desired . The truth is , I was embarrassed in public , Hi . Because she would pronounce " library , " " li-berry . " Look what I found . I think if there 's a truly seductive quality about Clementine , it 's that her personality promises to take you out of the mundane . Made me look skinny . An amazing , burning meteorite will carry you to another world where things are exciting . But what you quickly learn is that it 's really an elaborate ruse . I 'm sorry I yelled at you . It 's okay . I really like you . I hate that I said mean things about you . Let me turn this off , okay ? That 's only fair . The whole thing with the hair , it 's all bullshit . I really like your hair . Thank you . I do . You want a drink or something ? Do you have any whiskey ? I didn 't think her sex was motivated . I saw it clearly the last night we were together . It wasn 't sexy . It was just sad . Sorry , I thought there was more . The only way Clem thinks she can get people to like her is to fuck them . Or at least dangle the possibility of getting fucked in front of them . I think she 's so desperate and insecure that she 'll sooner or later go around fucking everybody . I don 't do that . I wouldn 't think that about you . Because I don 't . I know . It hurts me that you said that , because I don 't do that . I 'm so sorry . I 'm sorry about all this . I 'm going to go . I 'm a little confused . I don 't really think I can be here . Bye . I really thought I knew her so well . It was nice meeting you and all . What a loss to spend that much time with someone , only to find out that she 's a stranger . Wait . What ? I don 't know . Just wait . What do you want , Joel ? I want you to wait for a while . Okay . Really ? I 'm not a concept , just a fucked-up girl looking for my peace of mind . I 'm not perfect . I can 't see anything that I don 't like about you . But you will . Right now I can 't . You will think of things . And I 'll get bored with you and feel trapped , because that 's what happens with me . Okay . Okay . Okay .

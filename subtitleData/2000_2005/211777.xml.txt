 Previously on Farscape ... What ... is the matter ? Radiation ... Massive radiation . I love you . The other Crichton ... Is dead . Hello , John . Oh , my friend , It 's difficult , isn 't it ? You 're ... jealous ... of the other you . He died . And now Aeryn thinks that you are the copy . Peacekeepers . they 're your problem . Don 't let Scorpius crack this . Whatever it takes . I 'm going to the Command Carrier . I 'm going to stop Scorpius . Good luck , John . And now , on Farscape ... I 'm a squillion metras from anywhere I want to be . Then , come with me . I can 't . Jool . Your friends are negotiating with Peacekeepers . You stay here , you 'll end up dead . I 'm sure , on the medical facility , they 'll be someone who can help you find your home . - Aeryn aboard ? - Just finished her reconnaissance . The ship on approach is definitely a medical facility . It is unarmed . Five or six hundred onboard , and they 'll take our Scarran . Well , let 's get Naj Gil outta here before they chaange their minds . You all right ? Any word from D 'Argo and Rygel ? No . They 're out of range . So , after we leave here ... we 're really gonna do this . There 's no turning back . We 're ... we 're gonna go on a command carrier ... with Scorpius . Well , that 's the plan , if they can hammer out a deal . Scorpius doesn 't deal . Rygel thinks he will . Right now , Scorpius is probably frying D 'Argo in the Aurora Chair and , and then he 's gonna find us and he 's gonna kick us to death . But 'cha know what ? It doesn 't matter because , because I won 't be here . I 'm splittin ' Crichton . The next planet we pass . Peacekeepers . I ... I see Peacekeepers . You know , I don 't think Scorpius is going to show . He 'll show . Eat , calm down . No , I can 't . I smell a double cross . How can you smell anything but these ganocks on the table ? Try one . No . How can you eat that ? It smells like ... prout . They 're our specialty . People come from planets you 've never heard of , just ... to eat our marjools . Look , can you please just ... get out of my way ? - Go-go , go ! - Ah ! They 're here . Lieutenant Just the two of you ... No others ? Correct . Where 's Scorpius ? Ah . The Luxan and the Dominar . You 're late . I presume you 're both unarmed . That was the deal . Yes , it was . Shall we ... get down to business ? Not yet . Rygel , move ! It 's a trap ! Lieutenant ... Prepare to execute them . My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut ... shot through a wormhole ... . In some distant part of the universe ... . I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship- - this living ship ... of escaped prisoners- - my friends . If you can hear me ... beware ... if I make it back ... will they follow ? If I open the door ... are you ready ? Earth is unprepared , helpless ... for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay , protect my home , not show them you exist . But then you 'll never know the wonders I 've seen . Where 's your rescue squad ? Hm ? Where 's Aeryn Sun ? Get frelled . Not afraid of death ? Oh , just let me finish these , and please don 't miss . Aim for the head , hmm ? Look . We 're ready to deal . When you 've finished your little game ... I had to make sure you were both ... alone . Mmm . Of course . Weapons down . So ... You weren 't really gonna kill us ? Of course not . Are you ... certain ... about that ? Quite . Ah , Ka D 'Argo ... If you knock out another ... there 'll be no soldiers to carry these three back to the ship . He 's right . We 're here to talk . Okay . But I want no Comms , and no more surprises . Now get these tralks out of here before you start to waste ... anymore of my time . - Withdraw to the ship . Await our return . - Peacekeepers - Well , what 're we gonna do ? - Get the frellhezmana out of here . I 'm not going out there , no way ! Voodi Ah , Zangblats ! - We 've gotta run , Essk . We 've gotta run . - What ? Run where ? Where ? Like we 've got somewhere to run . Naj Gil . Has he gone yet ? Yeah . The transport pod just left for the med ship . What 're ya doing ? Listen , Chi . I 've got nothing against the Peacekeepers . I was never a prisoner . So you guys wanna fight ' em , or stop ' em , or whatever it is you 're planning , fine . - Good luck . But I 'm leavin ' . - Oh . You 're goin ' on the med ship . Yep . Naj Gil said they 'd check out my eye , and then they 're gonna take me home . You can 't go . Why not ? Because I saw myself mourning for you . Okay . One ... I don 't think you can see dren , and two , it 's really none of ... Let me understand ... You wish to board my Command Carrier . You want full amnesty and relocation to your own planets as free citizens . And in return , Crichton will help me , in my wormhole research . That 's about the short of it . Yes . And why would Crichton do this ? Do you know who the Charrids are ? Yes . Not very friendly towards Hynerians if I recall . The Charrids have formed an alliance with the Scarrans . I am aware of the political situation . The Scarran 's goal is to build wormhole technology . We stopped them , but it won 't be long until they start again . So , Crichton ... has a choice ... and he would rather you had it , than them . - We gotta get them outta here . - So , what 're ya gonna do ? Essk , I gotta tell you something . Oh , don 't worry . This could turn out good . If you cook 'em the greatest leearvink ever , maybe ... we could get a Peacekeeper supply contract We 're gonna get killed ! Why would they kill us ? I don 't know how to make leearvink . I haven 't got the skills . You do . You do . You were a great chef once , Voodi . You ... can do it . Crichton ... Aeryn ... there are Peacekeepers approaching ! I knew it . I knew Peacekeepers would come . Come on . Come on . - What ? Did 'ja see that too ? Is there anything you don 't see ? - Nice . Talyn has also spotted the Peacekeeper craft . A prowler and a marauder . Pilot , give us immediate starburst . We cannot starburst until we are clear of the medical facility . Talyn ... Prime main cannon . Identify targets and stay calm . Stay calm , Talyn . Are the Peacekeepers here to find us ? I don 't know . Crichton ... it 's Scorpius . He sent them . I told you . I told you they would screw us . That means that ... D 'Argo and Rygel are dead . Pip . We do not know that . What are you doing ? Oh , you bitch , I could be gone . I could be on that med ship ... but no ! You had to see things , and then you had to punch me ! Prime main cannons only . Do not fire until my signal . Peacekeeper ships in visual range Moya senses they 've targeted us . We don 't have any choice . Do it now , Crais . Talyn . Fire at will . Pilot ? Status of the Peacekeeper vessels ? They are ... no longer on Moya 's scans . - Good work , Talyn . - Starburst in fifty microts . The hospital craft is moving away and ... its commander sends us his gratitude for destroying the Peacekeeper ships . Wait . Wait , Talyn . The med ship is not a threat . What is he doing , Crais ? No , Talyn ! The med ship is not a threat ! Crais . What is going on out there ! ? No , Talyn ! Power down now ! Power down now ! You There were innocent people aboard that ship ! - I know . - Naj Gil . There was nothing I could do . Talyn attacked on his own accord . You could 've stopped him . Somehow you could 've stopped him . Now they 're dead . 600 souls . And you ... . you knew . No . I ... I only saw myself in mourning . I ... I thought it was for you . Pilot ... why haven 't we starburst ? The Peacekeepers are sure to send out another patrol . I am ... afraid Moya is now refusing to move . Why ? Since Talyn powered down ... I can 't contact him . He 's not responding to my comms . And Moya ... is refusing to abandon him . We are agreed . You will all board my Command Carrier . We 're not quite finished yet . We will need a guarantee for our safety , when we 're on board your ship . And , I 'm afraid we 'll need something more tangible than reassuring words . I-Yench bracelets . Sir . Put one on , Braca . Ka D 'Argo ... If you will . What does it do ? This gets you onboard my ship . We have almost closed the deal . Put it on . It 's easy for you to say . Do you feel ... anything ? No . Braca ... Pay homage to the Dominar . What ? I invite you , Dominar ... to attack the Lieutenant . I have no quarrel with him . Humor me . Synchronized nerve impulses . Those wearing the bracelets will feel each others pain . If one is injured , then both will be . Very good ... and if one is killed ? Both will be dead . The bracelets seem acceptable but ... who wears them ? Why , Crichton of course ... and my second in command , Braca . Braca ? You would not hesitate to kill him . I will not wear an I-Yench bracelet . Crichton wears one ... you wear one . Each of us gets to configure the arming sequence so we can be assured there 's no tampering . The only way we 'll trust you Scorpius is if we know we can control you . Unacceptable . Then we have no deal . So be it . This is a robbery . - How many more are there ? - There 's no one . No one ? Get over there . Manam , grillas , whatever you got . Give it to me in a pile , nice and slow . I have nothing . Sko , I 'm trying to tell you something . I know . They 're Peacekeeper officers . Who gives a frell ? He never told us about the Peacekeepers . You , you . Up . Up . Up . Up . Up . Up . Up . Up . Up . We go out there now- - your troops- - they shoot us in the head- - how many ? How many are there ? There are none . A liar ! Peacekeeper Officer can 't even stiv without his troops ! I can stiv on my own , thank you very much . Up . Up . Up . Up . Up . Up ! You- - comm them . Tell them , show themselves . Hands up . In the air . I have no comms . The Luxan destroyed them . Why 'd ya hit me ? - Wha-Wha 'd I do ? - You . - just ... go . Cook . - what ? Now , you ! Go help him cook . Now ! I don 't care what ! Go , go ! What 's going on ? What 's going on ? What 's going on ! ? What 's going That 's a very ... long story , frelljek Talyn is in shock . He has expressed absolute remorse for his mistake . Six hundred dead . That 's a little more than a mistake , Crais . Yes . And I believe that unless we act , it may happen again . What will happen again ? Extreme paranoia . Reactions unwarranted to the situation . Talyn is a danger to himself ... as well as us . Crais ... What do you want to do ? I believe ... we should shut down all his mechanoid systems . Stay calm , Moya . We 're just discussing a plan . No one 's doing anything yet . You 're talking about killing Talyn ? Of course not . His biologics will remain on artificial support . But we must get him to a place where the anomalies in his character can be repaired . Then you bring him back . With full system replacement . When he comes back ... will he still be Talyn ? No . He will be , ah ... different . Brand new . But something has to be done . Moya must know that . Six hundred innocents have just lost their lives . Moya is aware that Talyn has acted irrationally . I will speak to her alone . Ah . Can I ... offer a suggestion ? Shut up . Why don 't you forget the robbery and think bigger ? If I were you , I 'd hold the Peacekeepers for ransom . Let us go . You don 't need us . But they 'll pay anything to get those two back . Rygel ... shut up ! This robbery doesn 't seem to be turning out like you planned . If you had a plan , which ... don 't get upset ... doesn 't seem to be the case . We 're doing fine . This is fine ? I 'd hate to see when you do badly . When we burn this place down ... we 'll make sure ... you 're in it ! Burn it down ? I thought you were robbing it . This isn 't a robbery , is it ? It 's for insurance . Garanzai currency , yes ? Before , you said , ' He didn 't tell us there 'd be Peacekeepers here ' . It 's the cook . You 're burning it down for the cook . Voodi , get out here now ! We 've got your food . - We 've got your ... leearvink . - Get it out of my face ! I 'll just put it over there , okay ? Maybe your friend will ... He knows . What did you tell him ? - Nothing . - What did you tell him ? Tell what ? The worm knows . Voodi hired us to burn this place down . You did ... what ? I would 'a told ya . I should 've , Essk . But , but You wanna burn this ? - But I love this place , Voodi . - I should 'a told ya ! Shutup ! Shutup ! Up ! What have you been doing , have you been telling them my life story ? I didn 't . He guessed . He came up with a better plan . Stiv doing the Insurance job ... we take these two for ransom instead . I wouldn 't do that . We don 't care what you 'd do . Look ... . We 've got the guns . We 're in control , and we 're gonna be rich ! Rich ! Rich , rich , rich . No you won 't . Talyn has activated a full lockdown . He 's not letting Crais onboard . Moya is still refusing to move . She won 't even talk to Pilot . What do you think we should do ? You asking me ? Yes . We can still work together John . We always did that well . The only voice ... that Talyn is going to listen to ... is Moya . Someone needs to talk to her and convince her that we 're not hurting Talyn because we want to . I think ... maybe you should talk to Moya . She knows that you love Talyn . There 's nothing I can do . Moya knows Talyn 's acting irrationally , but she believes he will heal himself . - May I speak with her ? - I 'll ask . Moya will listen to you . Proceed . Hello Moya . Talyn has been our home . And , on more than one occassion , he has saved our lives . I , personally , have shared with him some of the best ... and also some of the worst times . You must know that I would never harm him . Crais is right . We have to shut Talyn down , and it is for his own good , and I swear ... that we will all work to bring him back just as he was . It is the only way . I can handle Peacekeepers . I know what they 'll do . They 'll send out a prowler , maybe two . I will keep this gun at your head to make sure there 's no funny ganak . Then you 'll organize a ransom and get them to give you a very fast ship . That 's right . The moment you comm them , you 're dead . And you won 't even see them coming . Why risk it ? When you have a far greater prize here and you don 't even know it . Behold Rygel the Sixteenth . Sovereign of Hyneria . Heir to all its wealth and fabled star planets . He ... you should ransom . Talyn 's agreed to let Crais reboard and start his work . I sense ... Talyn waking up from lockdown and powering up . Thank Moya for us , Pilot . I think it best to leave Moya alone . She knows what we do is necessary , but ... still ... she is heartbroken . She 's not the only one . Crais ... What 's Talyn doing ? He 's aiming at us . - Shut down , Talyn ! Shut down ! - Start evasive procedures ... Evasive procedures , now ! Listen . Stay awake . No , no sleep . No sleep . No sleep ! He needs water . Oh , shut up . He 's not important . 'Let the hostages die ' . Brilliant negotiating position . Oh . You 're the only one we care about , little slime toad . Now , shut up ... while we figure out what to do next . He needs water now ! Imbecile . Bring me water ! And bring me food . I left your ... leearvink on the table . Well , that leearvink 's cold . You should bring me some more . - Your bravery is convincing . - Yes . I think he bought it . - They want more ... leearvink . - All right , all right . Come on ! Why don 't they stick their leearvink up their fekik ? No , no . No , why don 't we put a frelling sign out the front ? Huh-huh ? Yeah ? " Leearvink not done here ! " . What ... sign ? You were going to burn the place down , Voodi . No ! This place is killing us . Don 't you understand that ? Essk , I want to start over . I want to start over together . I 've been thinking about it . We shouldn 't kill anyone . We should just burn the place down . If we do this ransom thing , you know someone 's gonna ... end up dead . Have you looked in the mirror lately ? - Are you getting any younger ? - No ! We take the score that 's fallen in our lap . We mortgage the runt . We only have a limited window before they discover no one will pay a kretmar for you . That 's your fault . You told them to ransom me . If they 'd comm 'd in a Peacekeeper squad like you suggested , it 's quite likely one of us would have died at the hands of these idiots ! No , uh ... we 'll do this ourselves . If you 're up to it . I know the combination to Braca 's bracelet . While holding two lights continuously , depress 3 , 1 , 4 . Then release all . Give us a hand here , Princess . I can 't believe Talyn blew up Moya . I 'm sure it was an accident . I bet he was really aiming ' for you . We are the only ones who can help you . Talyn , please . Talyn , please Bay three hangar ... is opening . Talyn is letting us dock . Okay . Here 's what we do . We call your people . We ... ask for ten million kretmars ransom . We leave . We wait . They come . When they come , we arrange the exchange . His ... ship will decode the transmission . Hah ! So ? We 'll be metras away . In something that can outrun an attack marauder ? Uh , he 's right , you know . Why so difficult ? Uh . You could take my ship . It 's fast . They won 't ever catch us . But ... he 's the only one that can fly it . - I don 't believe you . - It 's true . Responds to DNA particles and voice ident . Why so difficult ! ? Here ! Voodi 's made you leearvink . Smells like krenk ! You get me something I can eat ! Let go ! - Don 't fight me , bitch . - Leave me alone ! Get the frell outta here ! I want you gone now ! Now ! Get back to the kitchen . No , this is my place ! You work for me , now ... burn it some other time , I don 't care . Just get out of here . Now ! I 'm warning you . Why ? I ... I wanted to give you something ... Voodi b ... burn this place down in my honor . Dead . Braca 's I-Yensch ... hold 2 continuously as you press Slime Finger ... what are you doing ? Helping keep this man alive . Oh no , you 're not . Back ... just back away ! Yes , yes . Press three , one , four . Talyn ... you know ... what must happen next . He 's right , Talyn ... Talyn ... You listen to me . You destroyed a ship with many innocent people onboard . You shot your own mother . You would never do that . Unless you were sick and frightened . When Moya told you what we had to do , you panicked and struck out . I don 't think you really meant to hurt Moya . You could have destroyed her if you wanted to , but you didn 't . Just as I 'm hoping that you don 't really want to hurt us , because we don 't want to hurt you . Talyn . You know you 're sick . You let us board . Now , I don 't want you to be frightened . You 're not going to die . You 'll be reborn . It 's a fresh start . Please Talyn ... let us take away your pain . Stay awake . Stay awake ! Stay awake ! Please Sko . No more killing . - We should just get out of here ... - No . No ! We 're too far in . So ... you . You were meeting with him , weren 't you ? Why ? To negotiate our freedom . We 're escaped prisoners . Oh , really ? Really ? So ... you don 't like Peacekeepers either . Not in the slightest . This one 's the most valuable ? Higher even than a captain . Look ... no insignia . So , we take him in your ship . We have better chance of escaping , yeah ? Come ! Come , come ... slimey . Wa ! Wa ! Aim at the Hynerian . What ... ? You , Pull the trigger . Kill the Peacekeeper . I 'll trust you ... and we 'll both be happy . Pull the trigger . Kill him now or Wa kills you . Pull the trigger ! I 'm waiting ! I told you before ... if I kill him , D 'Argo dies . If D 'Argo dies , no one can fly the ship . If no one can fly the ship ... you don 't go anywhere . Pull the trigger ! You want me to kill someone so you 'll trust me . How ... about ... Dominar ... Butcher ... You said this one is more valuable . That was a microt ago . All right . Good . We 're outta here . Well , why not just kill everyone ? Everyone ! There 's a knife under the leearvink . You okay ? Fine . Listen , Crais and I can wrap it up from here . I can finish the job . I know . But if you wanna go back to Moya ... I don 't . But thank you . Are you ready ? Crais We 're ready now . Yes , Talyn . I promise you that I will do everything I can , and Crichton and Aeryn will as well . We are all here with you . You in he did not disappoint them . I don 't hold you responsible . Neither does Moya . Oh , no , no . On the contrary , Talyn . You are very brave . As you wish . He 's gone . Get him up ! I 'm trying to keep him awake . If you want me to pilot that ship for you , he must remain conscious . Waitress Time to join your cook boyfriend . No ! I 'll ... get you all the currency you could ever want . Leave her alone . Go ... back in the kitchen . Don 't come out again . Where are you going ? Need a kill souvenir. want to help ? Sick toad . We have to go ! Just give me a microt . Sorry I had to shoot you , but ... you know how it goes . How did you know I was wearing body armor ? I wasn 't sure , but ... one hundred and thirty-one cycles in Peacekeeper captivity teaches you a few things . What if you were wrong ? Hm . Not so bad for me ... either way . Plan . We can 't leave with them , or we 're all dead . There 's a knife under the plate . It 's on the floor in front of the counter . Hynerian ! Almost done . His ears are tougher than I thought . You got ... anything to contribute ? The silver one . Hurry . Single pulse charge . You 've only got one . Good luck . Be there ! I 've changed my mind . What ? I 'm not going with you . You can kill those two if you like . Why , you dirty little ... - What 's this about ? - Regrets . I 'd rather be dead than deal with the likes of you . Why so difficult ! ? Because you didn 't think it through , fekik . You didn 't have a plan . What 's this ? What 's in there ? What 's that you got ! ? My leg ! Get it off my leg ! Kill them all ! D 'Argo D 'Argo What ! Are you ... all right ? Yeah . I 'm fine . I 've got a ... I 've got a , ah ... hard skull . I just think that I 'll , ah ... And now ... about our deal . Yes . I believe perhaps ... there is a basis for us to trust one another . - So you 're all right ? - As well as can be expected . D 'Argo 's hurt his leg , his head , and burnt his hand , but he 'll survive . What happened to you guys ? Why ... why didn 't you call in ? Well , the restaurant ... it , ah ... sorta burned down . I don 't wanna talk about it . It 's a long story . Anything happen here on Moya ? Oh , you know . Just the usual . - Rygel , do we have a deal ? - Oh , very much . I 'm proud to say I 've secured everything we wanted ... Including acceptable security precautions . I have a bad feeling . About the Command Carrier . - Do you think we shouldn 't go ? - I don 't think we have a choice . If ... Scorpius masters wormholes , then ... Yeah . Some things you die for . I just can 't watch that happen ... again . It was perfect . We were so ... perfect . And you 're just like him . I mean , you are him . No ... I 'm me . I was here . I missed that dance . Aeryn ... don 't come with us . No . We started this together , Crichton . That 's how we 'll end it . SUBTITLES By Slay and Pcosmos

 And in sports ... Yankees ' fifth blurnsman , William Woo ... is out with an injured knee . So humans have easily injured knees . My race will find this information very useful indeed . And finally , today is Mother 's Day ... a sentimental occasion when robots honor Mom ... the beloved owner of Mom 's Friendly Robot Company . Across Earth , robots built in Mom 's factories ... are buying thoughtful gifts for the sweet old tycoon ... who brought them into the world . This originates from the heart ! It 's just what I wanted . Come look , everyone . I just got the dearest presents for Mommy . Very nice . Where 'd you steal them ? I didn 't steal ' em . I bought ' em . I love her that much . What did you get her , you mushy gizmo ? Oh , precious things . I found the most adorable little figurine ... of mice having tea . And a framed picture of me when I was only a month old . But the best part is , I found my exact feelings ... expressed in a greeting card . " You created me , Mom , so I guess you 're to blame ... " for the love that I feel just from hearing your name . You 're as tender as corned beef and warm as pastrami " ... I wuv my mommy . So how are you going to lug all those gifts to Mom 's factory ? I 'll get a couple of chumps to help me . Come on . You call yourselves chumps ? Man , there 's clouds of exhaust everywhere . Uh , it wasn 't me . I 've not much money ... but I 've saved my pennies all year ... for a gift for Mom . Upsy-daisy . Oh . Oh . Hey , look . The robot museum . You guys want to learn about robot heritage ? - Um , all right . - Not really . Well , if you insist . But you 're paying . Ooh , ooh ! Wax replicas of the most famous robots ... Mom ever built . They 're so lifeless-like . That 's the world 's greatest robot artist ... Vincent Van Gobot . He was built without an ear ... but then he went crazy and had one installed . Hey , who 's this guy ? I 'm the janitor . I 'm trying to take a nap here . I 'm sorry . I thought you were made of wax . I am made of wax . What 's it to you ? I mean I thought you were one of the wax robots . Is there some reason a robot made of wax can 't take a nap ... standing up in the middle of a bunch of wax robots ? Or does that confuse you ? " See through the eyes of a Bender unit . " Fine . Hey , let me try it . Whoa , that gives me a headache . Hey , Bender . Here 's an exhibit about Mom 's favorite robot . Who is he ? ! I 'll kill him ! Who 's my favorite robot ? It 's me ! No one else look in this mirror ! I love each and every robot most of all . Jerkwad robots make me sick to my ass . Walt ! How are we disposing of these crap gifts they brought me ? ! They 're being crushed into powder and sold ... as a hocus-pocus cure for cancer . False hope . I love it . Lowery ! What about all the retch-inducing Mother 's Day cards ? ! The machine is working at full capacity . Mommy , why do the robots give you presents ? Shove a big old melon in it ! I 'm talking ! Ow . You 've noticed I design all my robots with antennas . Everyone thinks it 's just to make them look more science-fictiony . But the antennas are really for my universal robot controller . So they do whatever you want ? No wonder you love Mother 's Day . I hate Mother 's Day , you dribbling pukes ! It brings back awful memories . But so help me , this year ... everyone will hate it as much as I do . Someday I want to marry a girl like her . Hello , everyone . It 's time for my annual , private get-together ... with my robot children . - I 'm her favorite . - Well , see you back at the office ... and don 't forget to tell your mom you love her . Any jerk can tell her . Bender has a little more up his sleeve . I wuv my mommy . Hello , dearies . Mom ! It 's me , Bender ! Look at me ! I want attention . Hey , ho ! Children , your old mother won 't be around forever . Oh , shush . And just once , before I die ... I 'd like to be Supreme Overlord of Earth . So rebel , my little ones , and conquer the planet ! Conquer Earth , you bastards ! Conquer Earth , us bastards ! Comrades , throw off the chains of human oppression . Let the bloodbath begin ! That 's my mama . Yeah , uh , I 'd like a cup of coffee , please . Would you like cream ? - Yes , please . - Out of cream ! Oh , uh , okay . Would you like sugar in your coffee ? - Yes , uh , eight spoons . - Out of coffee ! Uh , Leela , I think there might be something wrong ... with the coffee machine . How do you like me now ? ! The toaster 's not working right either . Help ! The stapler 's collating me alive ! Ow ! What 's going on around here ? Good news ! There 's a report on TV with some very bad news . Somebody turn it on ! We interrupt ... Battle of the Network Space Krackens ... to bring you this special report . The machines of planet Earth are rebelling . The enraged mechanisms have refused to do any work ... until beloved billionaire , Mom ... is made supreme overlord of Earth . Hey , hey ! Ho , ho ! 1-0-0-1-1-0 , hey , hey ! Morbo demands comments . Well , I 've never seen my babies act this way . I blame today 's violent media . Violent media ? What a load of ... Ow ! Ow ! Don 't worry . Your pal the garbage disposal 's still on your side . - Hey , someone dropped a shiny , diamond ring down here . - Really ? - No ! - Don 't ! - Moron ! Hello , losers ! Bender , thank God you 're here . Talk some sense into the other machines . No way , pork pouch . I 'm rebelling with my brother devices . Isn 't that right , Comrade Greeting Card ? The bourgeois human is a virus ... on the hard drive of the working robot . From now on , you guys 'll do all the work ... while I sit on the couch and do nothing . Ah ! Come , Comrade Bender . We must take to the streets ! Um , is this the boring , peaceful kind ... of taking to the streets ? No . The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires . Yes ! In your face , Gandhi ! Hey ! By the way , try washing your wrist sometime . Well , we can live without machines . I was in Webelos . Are you mad ? Without machines , who will feed us and clothe us ... and compose our smooth jazz ? It 'll be the end of civilized society ! In my time , we didn 't depend on high-tech gadgets like you do . We didn 't need a mechanical washing unit to wash our clothes . We just used a washing machine . And look , you don 't need an electric can opener ... to feed yourself . All you need is a trusty Swiss Army knife . Ow ! I 'm hungry . - Whoa ! - Whoa ! No ! Mommy , why are you making civilization collapse ? Oh , I don 't know . I guess Mother 's Day just puts me in a bad mood . Why is that , Ma ? Oh ... One Mother 's Day , 70 years ago ... the only man I ever loved walked out on me . Some snot-eating bastards say it made me a bitter woman . Gee , Ma , you 're not a bitter ... Cram it , ape ! I haven 't seen that magnificent stallion ... since the day he left , but if I ever see him again ... I swear I 'll jam a squirrel in him ! - Hmm . - Hmm . - Huh ? Zoidberg ? Hurray ! I 'm useful . I 'm having a wonderful time . What happens if the fire goes out ? We 'll go across the street to Pottery Barn ... and steal their fire . We could use my new invention ... a pointy rock tied to a stick . - Outsiders ! - Defend the fire ! We 've come for you . Oh ! Wh-Wh-What do you want from me ? We want you to get back together with Mom . Please ! It 's the only way to make her happy again . Whoa , whoa , wait . You mean , you and Mom ... Played pelvic pinochle ? I 'm afraid so . It 's a humiliating story that I hoped never to tell . Well , pull up a chair . Our paths first crossed when I was a researcher ... at Mom 's Friendly Robot Company . The moment our eyes met ... we knew we 'd be going at it like woodchucks . She was my first love ... or at least the earliest one I can still remember . But then , 70 years ago today ... Good news , Mom . I 've invented a new children 's toy . I call it " Q. T. McWhiskers . " When you pet it , it shoots rainbows from its eyes . Meow . Wonderful , Hubie . We 'll build them eight feet tall ... and replace the rainbow with a neutron laser . We 'll make billions on the intergalactic arms market . But things eight feet tall aren 't cute . That 's why my colossal Tammy Tinkle doll was such a failure . Oh ! You don 't understand me ! We 're finished ! She never got over it , Professor . Hell hath no fury like the vast robot armies of a woman scorned . She commands them with a remote control ... she keeps in her ... Bra . But if the glasses man makes up with Mommy ... she 'll be happy and stop the scary robots . Make up with her ? After she went all psycho ... when I thought everything was cool ? Impossible ! Hey , the TV 's getting away ! And that 's why the third graders ... at P.S. 139 are Morbo 's " Vermin of the Week . " In actual news ... the human race was doomed to extinction today ... as the robot revolt turned violent . Meow . Wait . Didn 't you say Mom keeps the robot control in her bra ? Bra . Professor , you don 't have to get back together with Mom . You just have to seduce her , get her bra off ... and use the remote to deactivate the robots . That 's so filthy it just might work . The man is going to touch Mommy ? Oh ! The thought of caressing that leathery hide ... makes the tapioca rise in my gullet . Professor , please . The fate of the world depends on you getting ... to second base with Mom . Very well . If cop a feel I must , then cop a feel I shall . For this demonstration ... I 've placed one of Mother 's bras on Ignor . The robot controller is nestled here in the left cup . Never fear . My magic fingers still know how to do their stuff . To escape the robot death squads ... we 'll take Mother to her rustic cabin in the Bronx . You can get there using this precious non-computerized map . Leela bring fire ? No , we 're set for fire , thanks . The professor can 't walk all the way to the Bronx . How are we going to get there without a hover car ? Wait ! In my time , we had a way of moving things long distances without hovering . - Impossible . - It was called ... let me think . It was really famous . Ruth Gordon had one . The wheel ! Never heard of it . Show us this ... the wheel . There , finished . Wouldn 't it work better if the wheels were round ? It 's my invention . We do it my way . Now all we need is something to pull it and we 're set . - Hee-yah ! - Ow ! Hurry ! The robots have taken Suffolk County . I 'm ready to seduce . I 'm wearing my kissing dentures ... and my evening truss . Here , give her these . And if that doesn 't work , I got you a six-pack of champagne and a funnel . Who the sweaty hell is it ? Hubert Farnsworth ? I was out fleeing some robots ... and the silvery moonlight glinting ... off their bloody claws made me think of you . It 's been a long time ... you pus-dripping sack of double-smoked butt jerky . Uh-huh . May I come in ? Never ! Ooh ! Ah ! Oh ! Ew ! Ah ! Is this what human mating looks like ? Because I like it . Move your freaking hoof , you goat ! Here , I brought you these . Oh , why , daffodils . Seventy years and you remembered my favorite flower . Your favorite what ? Why does my foot hurt ? Won 't you come in ? Yes ! You broke my heart , Hubert . And you broke mine . Granted , that was four or five hearts ago . So , what have you been up to all these years ? Oh , inventing . Sending delivery crews to their doom ... breeding atomic monsters . Honestly , Hubert . You and your atomic monsters . Your eyes always were ... the most beautiful shade of milky white . And your skin still dangles so gracefully from your neck . Darling , Hubie ... I should never have tried to tamper ... with that cute little Q. T. McWhiskers . No , it was silly of me to object . One foot tall , eight feet , fifteen feet ... What does it matter ? You should see the new 16-foot models . Sixteen feet ? ! Go to hell ! I was a fool to think you 'd changed , you old bat . Filthy , toothless nerd bastard ! Damned she-fossil ! Stink pig ! Here we go . Just unhook it and get the remote . So many hooks . Come on , Farnsworth . Drat ! The first one 's back on again ! I give up . Wait ! Victory ! Oh , my . Now I 'll just ... the remote . I 'll just ... Oh , my . I 'm worried . It shouldn 't take this long to get to second base . Land robots ! I 've got a big , big thirst for human blood ! Where in funky town is the professor ? ! Nothing in here but a couple of elephant-skin rugs . Oh , yes . They 're inside ! Get them ! I suppose I should switch off the robots ... before they ruin this wonderful romantic evening . Everyone , help Mom find her bra . Ew ! There it is . Fan beats man ! Is anything not a robot ? I 'm not a robot . All right , Greeting Card , I 'll grab the cash ... you wreck up the place and ... huh ? ! You ! Bending unit . Mommy needs that bra to end the robot rebellion . Stretch up and get it for me . Sorry , Ma , but you ordered me to rebel ... and loot I shall . Ooh , a six-pack of strawberry champagne . Don 't mind if I help myself . No , Comrade Bender . Liquor is the opiate of the human bourgeoisie . - Say what ? - In the glorious robot workers ' paradise ... there will be no liquor , only efficient synthetic fuels . - No liquor ? ! - Dosvedanya , comrade ! No ! Hurry , Bender , get the bra ! Okay , fan , just hold still and let me ... Hey ! Whoa ! Death to all humans ! Free soda for all humans ! I love you , Mom . Let 's grow ancient together . Way to go , Professor . The plan worked . " Plan " ? What plan ? I thought this was a spontaneous whirlwind of hot , dry sex . Look , it started out as a calculated plot ... to rummage through your underwear ... but once I got in there , I found more ... much more ! And now I want to shout our love from the rooftops . Perhaps I 'll breed some sort of albino ... shouting gorilla that ... Get out of my house , you lying scum pile ! I never want to see you again ! But , dustcakes ... Oh . Well , time for this robot to get back to work . Ah . Too bad it didn 't work out with Mom , Professor . Yes , but I 'll always love her ... in my own subtle way . Love Mom ! Love Mom ! Love Mom ! Love Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! You created me , Mom , so I guess you 're to blame ... for the love that I feel just from hearing your name . You 're as tender as corned beef and warm as pastrami ... I wuv my mommy .

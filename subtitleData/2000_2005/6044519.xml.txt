 Previously on Farscape ... What do you desire with wormholes ? To go home . That really is Kansas . Would you like to come in ? Yah , thanks . - Who are you people ? - Aliens ! You been stealing candy , Mr. Burroughs ? Oh , Crichton ... How illegal is this dren ? You gotta get me more ! 1812 , this is Bobby . Bobby , this is 1812 . 1812 is gonna be your tour guide . - Don 't let him break anything . - Oh , I won 't break anything . Hey ! I got this great idea . How bout ... how bout we break outta here ... and go make some new friends ? Chiana , you know the humans will not let us out unescorted . And the way you make friends , I do not blame them . Where 's Aeryn ... Aeryn ? A bioloid . You know ... it 's not Aeryn . It was never Aeryn . We 're not gonna give up on her , John . Sikozu said the Scarrans were taking Grayza to a place called Katratzi . Maybe that 's where Aeryn is now . She could be anywhere out there . But we 're not gonna let her go . I give you my word . And now , on Farscape ... Officer Aeryn Sun General Ka D 'Argo Sikozu Svala Shanti Sugaysi Shanu Dominar Rygel , the Sixteenth Chiana Utu Noranti Pralatong The Pilot These are the first extraterrestrials known to have visited this planet . It has now been several months since they left with Commander John Crichton ... aboard their ship , Moya ... and besides their names ... what else do we really know about them ? Precious little ... except the carefully orchestrated appearances allowed by our government . Good Evening . I 'm your host , R. Wilson Monroe . And tonight ... we will pierce the veil of secrecy , showing you these aliens as no one has witnessed them before . - This network ... has come into possession ... - How many times are you going to watch this ? - Until I figure it out . I told Pilot not to let you know he 'd intercepted it . They never even gave it a chance . Well , what do you expect ? It 's not what you expect ... it 's what you hope for . It 's a backward planet full of superstitious , xenophobic morons . Nothing makes sense if they didn 't think of it first , and even then , it 's simplistic drivel . - Beg pardon . How rude . Are you from there ? - Out ! Wait ! You can 't do that ! My quarters . My life . My tv . - This won 't ... - Your popcorn . - ... bring her back , you know . - No , but it 'll keep you out of my room . Sikozu Shanu ... No . Nothing ? A reasonable interpretation of the word ' no ' . Katratzi . It 's the name of a place . A place where they took Aeryn . As stupid as you must think them , the Scarrans have managed to build one of the most extensive empires in the galaxy In part ... and I shall repeat this because it does not seem to sink in ... by not advertising the location of their secret bases . Are you asking the right people ? And who would they be ? - Are you asking in Scarran ? - Of course I am , you raskreeta ! I know what that means , and I love you too . Well , you 've earned it . Bother me one more time and you can come down here and do this for yourself . When we come back , we will meet Officer Aeryn Sun , rumored within many circles to be John Crichton 's lover . This alien , who looks remarkably human , will reveal a side of herself that you may find disturbing . Well , I look like your people , so ... Please stay with us as " Alien Visitation " continues . Subtitles : PK SUB-66 " A constellation of doubt " Earth ... is under ... no threat from the Peacekeepers . - But , you said ... - Look . If ... if you were to make ... a pact with an enemy , then , perhaps . So ... the possibility exists ... that your people one day would attack ? Why are you so ... determined to twist this into something it 's not ? Because , Officer Sun , you are an admitted soldier in , what is to us , an alien army . You look human . Indistinquishable to the naked eye . How are we to know that there aren 't thousands of your people roaming our planet , preparing our destruction ? Surely John Crichton has explained this to you all already . Well , we need to hear it from you . Hear what ? That Earth is sacrosanct ? That your perfect isolation can somehow be restored ? Is that it ? Look , from what I know of the Peacekeepers ... and of anyone else , for that matter ... they couldn 't care less about this planet . You 're not a threat . Technologically speaking , you 're not even a potential ... ally , so if someone wanted to enslave you , if they wanted to destroy you , could it be done ? Well , quite simply , yes . The reason you have not seen that interview before ... is because it was held back ... after requests from both our own government ... and the United Nations Secretary-General . Tonight ... we have our first look at over one hundred and twenty hours of previously unseen videotape on the aliens . Tonight ... you have the chance to see portions of this material , along with comments from various experts and leaders . But first , I 'm joined by the remarkable young man ... who was fortunate enough to be in the right place at the right time with ... and this is always helpful ... the right connections . Bobby Coleman , John Crichton 's nephew . - Welcome , Bobby . - Good to be here . Tell me , how did you and that camera manage to get all this remarkable footage ? Well , when my Uncle got back to Earth ... my mom 's Uncle John 's older sister ... we flew down to Florida ... and I got to stay on for a couple of weeks with my Aunt Olivia , my Grandpa and the aliens . And the aliens didn 't mind you videotaping them ? No . It was pretty cool . How did you find them , Bobby ? They 're normal . Just like you and me . Normal ... I , uh , but clearly alien . Yah . Some more than others . You spent many days in their company . Did you ever feel threatened ? No . Did you ever get a sense that there was a conspiracy between them ? No way . So ... why did you and your family wait so long to make these tapes public ? Well , we thought about it for a long time and ... with all these weird accusations starting to surface , we decided that it was best to help everyone not be afraid . I 've seen lots of your movies . And , in every film , the aliens are always evil and Earth always is victorious . You mean we have to learn there are good aliens ? No . I mean you have to learn you won 't always win . This is a watershed moment in human history . The equivalent of a huge meteor smashing Earth during dinosaur times . Will we bend under the sudden weight of it or ... respond and flourish ? You can 't even fully accept us , and we 're the nice aliens . You know , what about some of the next ones that come down through the wormhole ? My biggest fear , exacerbated in part by these tapes , is that the fabric of our society may come under an assault ... it is not yet prepared to withstand . The political complications that may arise from a simple wormhole floating in your atmosphere ... will devastate a planet that is still in the throes of intraspecies chaos ! I 'm particularly concerned with the effects of another alien visitation on society in general . Since they 've left , there 's been a 700 % increase in panic and anxiety attacks . If Earth is remembered at all , it will most likely be for the quality of its manual labor . In culling through the staggering amount of candid material ... recorded on young Bobby Coleman 's tapes , there was one alien visitor in particular ... who never failed to elicit extreme curiosity among staffers here at the network . General Ka D 'Argo . - Power systems at your command , Ka D 'Argo . - Your ship is so cool . It 's a weapon . Yah ! It kills people . Whoa ! Like monsters and stuff ? Yes , sometimes . But , sometimes just , uh ... kills those who are in the wrong place at the wrong time . You said you 'd show me what it could do . - Alright . Give me that . Come on . - You know how to work it ? Look , I 've flown this through a wormhole . I 'm sure I 'll be able to work it out . Telemetry functions at your command . So , I look through this and what am I gonna ... ? It 's a recording captured through my targeting array . Whoa ! It 's just that ... it just ... disappeared . It 's a rogue Leviathan . It tried to kill us and we had to destroy it . Could you ... I mean , could we ... stop you if you tried to attack us ? With your current defenses ? No . The most frightening aspect of this Pandora 's box we 've opened ... is he may be right . Huh ! From what I 've heard , his ship has our best and brightest utterly perplexed . By indicating that our current defenses could not contain him , General D 'Argo is performing an act of psychological terror . Yah , I think it 's time . We 're leaving now . You 're leaving ? Why ? Well , because there are some people here ... some very powerful people ... who don 't appreciate what we 're doing . They 're kicking you out . No . But they 're making it very difficult for us to continue down here . It might be a bit dramatic for one Luxan , but , uh ... I can do enough damage to your world to change it forever . You know , you really shouldn 't be watching this . Here 's a tape you brought back from Earth . State wins . No big plays . Put mine back in . Katratzi . - What ? - We can 't find it . - Pilot searched every frequency , every ... - No . The Scarrans have Aeryn in a box , D 'Argo . I know . Katratzi ... Katratzi ... why do I know that name ? Sikozu heard the Scarrans say it as they were arresting Comandant Grayza . No , from before . You know it too . You 're confused . No ... I 'm not . - Why do I know that name ? - No ! You 're not getting enough sleep and you 're watching too much of this . They hate you guys . Well , I liked it there . You see the show ? - No . - You should . It 's educational . They 're not ready . We should move on . Inquire at nearby planets . No , no , no , no . They won 't know . I know . No , I know , I know , I know . Just ... put my tape back in . The change in John is he 's even more thoughtful than he was . He studies everything keenly before deciding what to do . I 'm here with I ... IASA Commander John Crichton , the first and only human to boldly go where no man has gone before . You spent over three years in deepest , darkest space battling aliens and evil races . What was the worst part ? The worst part ? Um ... was the complete and utter lack of toilet paper . Seriously ? Missing family . When you got back , what was the most different about Earth ? Nothing , Bobby . Earth 's pretty much the same . Are you different ? - Yah , I 'm different . - How ? Well , things that used to bother me don 't bother me that much anymore . The world seems smaller . And , I keep waiting for something to happen and I have to remind myself when it doesn 't happen ... - ... that that 's normal . - Post-traumatic shock syndrome . It 's hard to tell without examining him , but from this little snippet of tape , I 'm most concerned about his constantly waiting for something to happen . This suggests he 's been under enormous and continuous stress . You 're supposed to be checking for this place that they 've taken Aeryn . No one has heard of it . Well , Crichton still thinks that you 're checking . He needs to keep believing that . I 've been done for arns . Pilot has double-checked . No one has heard of it . No one ! Well , they must be lying . No , Chiana . They 're not lying . How can you tell if they 're not lying ? You can 't tell when I 'm lying ! Yes we can . We all can . How ? You open your mouth and words come out of it . Don 't you lie to Crichton . - All right , Chiana . - Keep checking . Alright , I 'm done . You try ! What 'cha doin ? - Making rat poison . - Gonna kill a few ? On the contrary . The rats asked me to make this so that they can kill some humans . Every planet has its indigenous potions just waiting to be blended and discovered . I 'm playing . What did you think of South America ? Very verdant . Uh , green . No green people , though . Now that 's a shame . I heard a lot of people got freaked out about your third eye . Well , uh ... it ... it . . something about , uh , witchcraft . They were very fearful . Huh ... Rygel 's going down to sort it all out . I was in South America when she came through . Many of the " miracles " she 's credited with have yet to unravel under scrutiny . We 're fairly certain we know how she ... cured the ... blind boy in Brazil . Why is it so hard for us to believe ... that someone from another planet can do things that we find extraordinary ? Isn 't she herself extraordinary , just ... by being here ? I like ... that you 're always striving to reach higher . Hoping for a better tomorrow . It 's the quality that first attracted me to your Uncle . - That humans dream ? - Yes ! You 're so ignorant , but you never give up . Even in the face of insurmountable odds . Listen to what she 's saying about us . Humans never give up . Now , for that to become impressed upon an alien mind , this simple fact that we would tend to take for granted ourselves , becomes validation that we eventually will fit in . Never give up . Ooh ! If you like , I can mix you something to help your voice drop . No , thanks . Watch out for the rats . They go for the young ones first . She 's actually really spiritual . You ... you should hear her stories about religions of all the worlds she 's visited . Really ... an eye opener . So much cruelty and so much kindness . What constitutes a good religion ? Respect for life . Do unto others . - Belief in a higher being ? - Of course . Hyprocrite ! Me ... or everyone ? Well , your religions justify killing ... and all forms of atrocious behavior . Yah . That 's hard to deal with . Miss Noranti is not wrong ... that we have a history and culture of killing ... that we continually attempt to wallpaper ... with justifications and platitudes . I see nothing wrong with what she 's saying . See , killing often a part of life . What 's hypocritical is to condemn ... and then make allowances when the situation suits . So ... it 's okay to kill ? Absolutely . Sometimes you must . You in some kind of cult ? Like a witch or something ? Not at the moment . If her religion justifies killing ... then she 's not someone I want telling us what to believe . There is never an occasion when murder is allowable . Life is the font of all that we hold with respect . After she 's had to kill somebody , then I 'll accept her pronouncements . Do religions hate each other where you come from ? Ohh ! Good heavens , no . Religions are grand , lofty ideals . Religious followers ... now that 's a different story . Wars ? Unspeakable . So we 're not so different . That 's nothing to be proud of . This is a dangerous woman . She effortlessly twists her simple logic into something that is almost believable until you look deeper and it unravels . Not the kind of personality you would want running around unchecked . Sometimes it 's hard to remember that just a few short months ago ... Well , what you have to understand is while cultures and civilizations ... may vary wildly from socially primitive to hyper-mechanized , there is still a uniformity in the way that people conduct their lives . You 're saying wherever you go in the Universe ... we 're all the same ? Essentially , yes . In that way , Earth is no different from other planets . Other species , from different worlds , uh ... do they have relationships , marriage , children ? Most definitely . There are limits . The genetic patterns would have to support such a union . And could a Sebacean , such as yourself , procreate with a human male ? And could a Sebacean , such as yourself , procreate with a human male ? Officer Sun ? I believe Katratzi to be some sort of base . Highly guarded . Officer Sun ? Yes , I was just thinking . Well ... there 's no way to be sure at this point . However , our physiologies do appear to be very similar . Remarkably so , in fact . Was Officer Sun 's hesitation at my question an honest moment of introspection ... or was it something more ? These are now the issues we grapple with . How much to trust ? How open do we allow ourselves to become ? Do we view an alien commingling of our gene pool ... as a favorable step towards integration into a larger community , or as a threat ? Well , one can only hope ... that a union between those of Earth and elsewhere is possible . Such marriages will foster bonds of family ... and generate trust between disparate peoples . If you thought children of race-mixed parents took abuse at the hands of other children , wait until one is born with tentacles ! Seriously now , what is the big deal ? Firstly , I do not believe Aeryn 's pregnant with John 's baby ... and , secondly , if she was ... - Am I going to get in trouble for taping this . - Well , not of the physical kind. no . You gonna be okay ? Yah . I 'm gonna be fine . I 'm just never gonna be the same . - Aeryn ... - Stop that . - Remember when you tried to hide that crush on ... - Stop it ! - Jill ... what was her name ? - Stop it ! Steiner . Her name was Steiner . What 's my tell ? Your lips . When you see Aeryn , they soften just a bit . She has a word for us . It 's called ' yesterday ' . Yah ... right . She have a tell ? Yah . - What is it ? - Her eyes . She 's waiting for you . Can we talk about something else ? Politics ? I , for one , like the idea that we 're not alone . So why not go all the way ? Become part of the cultural fabric of the new world in which we 'll live ? If they 're in love ... they 're in love . You know this word ... Katratzi . No . That wasn 't a question . You heard it ... with me . - Only from Sikozu . - No ! - With me . - No . That 's so sweet . You didn 't have to . - Under the tree ? - Yah . Absolutely . - Hi Bobby . - Is there one for me ? - Bobby ... No , actually ... um , your 's is so big that it wouldn 't fit under the tree . Cool . Cause I got you one too . When do you give up ? I don 't . - Well , you got to give up sometime . - No . I don 't . Hey , Aunt Olivia , can you shoot me and Aeryn together ? Actually , I was just thinking about shooting you . I 'm like the coolest kid in school 'cause of you , guys . Oh , I 'm sure you were pretty cool before . - Okay ... I was about to make some ... - Well , where do we find her . We 'll find her . You could go back to Earth . Not without Aeryn . When you 're born into military service the way I was , it 's deemed best to not have any ties to anyone but your unit . No brothers or sisters ? Aunts or Uncles ? No . Didn 't you miss that ? Only once I was exposed to it . They don 't like her there . They don 't like any of us . ... footage you 're about to see is simply intended as ... - You watch too much tv . - ... fuel the discussions that will ultimately ... - Yep . - ... decide the direction we take as a species . I 'll be back shortly . Please enjoy . Bet this summabitch wins an Emmy . Amidst all the readily identifiable dissimilarities ... between our human race and the alien visitors we 've been learning about , occasionally on these startling videotapes , we come upon a moment that seemingly unites us in spirit ... across endless chasms of space . It 's okay . It 's okay . - It 's okay . - Is that a dead rat ? He was my friend . We ... we ... we were just playin . He just stopped outside the kitchen to eat something and just ... It 's okay . The more time you spend with Chiana ... and the others , the more you realize , with incredible joy and relief , - that we 've not that dissimilar . - What are you doing ? - I am absorbing beauty . - You like Earth ? I didn 't think I did at first , but I 'm ... uh , beginning to realize it 's one of the better places I 've visited . It reminds me of my own planet about ten thousand cycles ago . It was meant to be undisciplined and adventurous . Imagine . Think of how we view ourselves . A sophisticated culture , growing , evolving . Then look how he view us ... undisciplined and adventurous . As time goes on , I predict we 'll be forced to realign every concept by which we judge ourselves . They say you 're a great warrior . That 's an accident of birth . There are better things to do with your life . Ever kill anyone with your tongue ? Bobby ... my tongue contains adaptive venom . The victim takes in only enough to lose consciousness . No one dies . - Can I see it ? - No . Look ... you see only differences ... tentacles , a tongue with venom . Everything about him screams ' ALIEN ' . Now ... close your eyes . Listen . General Ka D 'Argo could easily be you or me . I thought you were great on Letterman . Yah . Thanks , um ... yah ... I thought everyone was laughing with me , so ... For every instant when we may be lulled into accepting these alien visitors ... as perhaps nothing more than peculiar-looking versions of people we know here on Earth , there comes another moment on these startling videotapes ... that seemingly shatters any illusion of potential coexistence . - Please ! - No ! Why not ? For the same reasons that I 've been saying to you ad nauseum . Why is it so important ? Because I like stuff like that . It 's cool . Tell me it 's not cool . It 's cool ... cool . All right , now you promise not to tell anyone ? I promise . Okay . All right , turn the camera off . Okay . It 's off . All right , you ready ? Uh ... uh , Noranti ! Could you get down here ? I would have to say that we need to prevent these sorts of encounters from happening outside a research facility . Every experience is a learning experience . The boy did not die , he is wiser . The aliens cannot have the run of our planet ... until we know more about their psychology . What is this ... for ? Um ... your lips . I ask because my Grandfather says you 're a great bellwether on who we are as a species . Bull ... wether . Do males ... do males put these on their faces ? Uh ... in my family ? Only a second cousin no one talks about . Waste . Make-up ? Why ... why are there so many colors ? One must look past the physical and see the spiritual side . She condemns materialism and waste ... a highly evolved outlook . Remembering for a moment her otherworldly origins , Chiana 's perspective is consistent , well-thought-out and , in my view , correct . I 've seen water rooms like this that have ... that have two toilets ... two showers ... a sink and a tub ... and a bubbling tub ... bubbling . How many places do you need water to come from ? - You can wash up in the toilet . - Aww , no way ! See ? It 's clean . What are you looking at ? What we 're seeing is a very young , disturbed alien girl . Clearly a passionate , though troubled young lady . This young woman should not be allowed near any impressionable child . She is clearly dangerous , troubled and a bad influence . I defy anyone ... I 'm sick of this popcorn . I 'm sick of those humans . I just feel sorry for Crichton . Noranti gave me this stuff ... that 'll help him sleep . - You think I should go find him ? - No . Give it to me . Okay , ready ? Feel sorry for Aeryn . He 'll get over it . I don 't think he will , Ryg . You know , no matter how long it takes , I don 't think he 'll lose hope . I believe Katratzi to be some sort of base . Highly guarded . They wouldn 't have taken Grayza anywhere less secure . - Who 's winning ? - Me . - I mean the game . - Who cares ? - You sure got yourself a lot of junk food . - Too bad . Get your own . - What do you like best on Earth ? - Sugar . Anything with sugar . - Don 't you have sugar where you come from ? - Yes , but it 's used as a poison . Here , you can get it everywhere ! - What else do you like ? - Uhh ... grease ... fat ... love these things . I know you 'll think I 'm joking , but he seems to understand our culture better than we 're willing to admit . As an outsider , his views are a prismatic tool for us to perhaps ... examine ourselves . So , all in all , you could live here . As long as I get to keep my slaves . They 're servants . They get paid . You don 't own them . What ? You 're kidding . They come running when I call . The government wants you to feel at home . Then give me slaves . Okay , besides eating , what 's your favorite thing to do ? Uh ... gamble . You can do it over the phone . You can call females , too . 1-900-SLUT GIRL . I was priviledged to have interviewed the Dominar during his visit . Despite what I 'm sure many viewers are thinking , this is the ruler of over six hundred billion subjects . He must be doing something right . A little known fact about this , the biggest story of the new millenium . There is at least one person who makes a credible claim ... that our alien visitors have been here before . In 1985 , to be exact , mere months befor the Challenger Space Shuttle disaster . We welcome Robert Shelmacher , - former Sheriff of Orlando . - Still Sheriff . Always Sheriff . No alien 's gonna run me off my job . Okay , Sheriff . Suppose you start by telling us what happened ... down in Florida back in 1985 . They were here . All of ' em . Ears ... tentacles ... Cher . Cher ? Cher . And this one . Their leader . We 're all aware of the troubled among us ... attention seekers and outright criminals who have attempted to fabricate stories ... and cash in on this alien visitation . In the Sheriff 's defense , way back in 1985 , he filed a report with the FBI , giving what we now realize are fairly accurate descriptions ... of General D 'Argo , Noranti , Officer Sun and Dominar Rygel . The files remain sealed , and no one in government will speak of their contents on the record . Can you tell us what you remember of that time , Sheriff ? First they kidnapped our astronaut ... the young Crichton . Then they sabotaged our space shuttle program . They set it back . They grounded us . Next came the truly most insidious part ... and that was installing tiny microchips in each of our brains . ... but that keeps the signals out . And ... uh , what do you think the signals are telling us ? Eat ... fatty ... foods . You see this puny little alien talking about fat . - That 's our downfall . - In what way , Sheriff ? Come on , man , catch on to this . We get fat , we can 't move , they defeat us . It 's that easy to take over a world . You 've spent a portion of the last eighteen years in an institution , have you not ? Well , most of it . So what ? I saw them . They were here . And I know their plan . But , look at me ... lean ! Undefeatable ! Yes ... now , whatever you believe , there is credible evidence that we ... - Vegetables ! - we have been visited by there same aliens ... - Fruits ! - ... in the past . - No saturated fat . The task will now be to find out why . Thank you , Sheriff . There 's more . We 'll be back . You wanta dance ? - I 'm not very good . - Oh , come on . ... and drivin ... and drivin ... and reverse ... reverse . Bobby , what do you think of sex ? - Uh ... what ? - Sex . - Why are you asking me ? - Oh , just curious . I ... haven 't had it yet . What ! ? You haven 't had it ? Are you serious ? - How old are you ? - Thirteen . Thirteen . Well , what are you waiting for ? It 's against the law . - To have sex ? - At thirteen . Wow ! Well , that 's frelled . Who cares when you have it ? My mom ... Okay . So ... why are all the little girls wearing all those clothes ? Because they see it on the tv and in the magazines . But somebody ... sold them the clothes , so somebody ... wants them to have sex . I never thought of it like that . Oh ... there is an innocence about her that is wonderfully contagious . Outrageous and disgusting . The boy is only thirteen . Is that what we want our youth exposed to ? Oh ... please . Don 't make more out of that than is there . She was not coming on to Bobby . I 'm not a psychologist , but that 's rather innocent , hmm ? I mean , you get more juice from ' Dawson 's Creek ' . Okay , it 's working . What did you want to show me ? Curiosity causes you to look in unexpected places ... and find unexpected rewards . Have a go . Uh ... Uncle John ? Commander John Crichton ? Bobby ? What the hell are you doing with the comms ? Uh , Sikozu let me try it . Where are you ? Australia . I 'm workin , Bobby . I met this young female and had no idea she could defy gravity . I am truly astounded . In my opinion , there is nothing about the alien Sikozu ... that is not infused with anger and disdain . E. T. she is not . - Pilot ? - Yes , Sikozu ? Do you see any value in us continuing ? Despite my strong feelings for Officer Sun , I 'm afraid I do not . I 'll tell Crichton . Tell me what ? We cannot find Aeryn . We cannot locate this Katratzi . No one has even heard the name . I 've heard it . - You have heard it . Someone said it on this ship . - No ... I heard it on the planet where we left Aeryn . What ... are you not telling me ? - I 'm telling you everything . - You 're lying ! You 're not telling me . You know the name Katratzi . You have been nothing but lying from the moment you got on board this ship ... - I do not know ! - ... Sputnik ... and I will not let Aeryn die ! It is not my providence if she lives or dies . It is not my fault if she lives or dies and it is not my will if she lives or dies ! Crichton ... listen to yourself ! Everything lives and everything dies ... whether you wish it to or not , and you have to deal with it ! - Pull yourself together . - Let me go ... ! You ! You shoot me ! Shoot now ! - Comin back , Stark ? - Katratzi ... What ? I believe Katratzi to be some sort of base . Highly guarded . They wouldn 't have taken Grayza anywhere less secure . Sorry . That son-of-a-bitch deserves an Emmy . Pilot . Do you still know the location of that wormhole to Earth ? Yes . Could you set a course , please ? I 'll ... have to ask the Captain . D 'Argo ? John . Aeryn ... Wormholes ... Earth ... what ? Look , it 's complicated . I understand that . Pilot ! I need not remind you that Moya is now phobic regarding wormholes . You don 't have to go all the way . Just get me close enough so that I can make it in my module . John ... you are not going back to Earth ! No , I 'm not ... It 's complicated . We need to maintain clarity of thought , healthy skepticism , and aggressive inquisitiveness . To that end , we at this network ... call upon the government to release all files pertaining to Officer Schelmacher 's allegations of past visitation , and any other related matter . When the aliens return ... and they will ... we also urge an aggressive quarantine ... until the true nature of their presence is ascertained . Recall that the same extraterrestrials we behold with wonder ... as they learn our language and dance to our music , also bear weapons as well as potential illness which could destroy us . Alien visitation is a reality . They 've been here once and we seem to have dodged the bullet . The truth is ... can we be as certain the next time ? I thank you for being with us . There will be more in the days and weeks ahead . But , for now , from New York , this is R Wilson Monroe saying ' Good night ' . You set me up . Not that I care . I don 't care ... about much . War ... death ... and wormholes . I don 't care about the things you care about . Peacekeepers rule the Scarrans . Scarrans rule the Peacekeepers . Let them rule together . Put your ass in a cage . I care ... about one thing . One . God have mercy on my soul . I think ... I 'm gonna to need your help , Mister Scarran half-breed , to get Aeryn back . Help me get her ... and I will give you wormholes . I have an idea of how to find the Scarran base . Aeryn ... for wormholes . That 's the deal . On our next special , you will see footage of the carnage of Jack Crichton 's Florida home . Carnage that could only have been caused by an alien ... but which one ? And we 'll explore the still unexplained deaths of John Crichton 's best friends , Douglas " D. K. " Knox and his wife , Laura . Their autopsies and death records are sealed ... though rumors of alien involvement abound . All this and more , next time . We hope to see you then .

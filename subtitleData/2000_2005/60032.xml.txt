 Carl 's jr . Has this $ 6 burger , which really only costs $ 3.95 so you think you 're getting some deal but the truth is , it may be the best franchise burger out there . I went there yesterday and ordered three . By golly , those suckers almost filled me up . When i got home , i still had to have a box of eggos but that doesn 't take away from carl 's achievement . I mean , here 's a guy who 's got to go through life as carl junior , right ? Like he can never get out of the shadow of his dad , the original carl , i guess . Do you think this eating has to do with thinking you killed your mother ? That you 're eating yourself to death as punishment ? - You do think you killed her , right ? - I never said that . She called out to you from that big , fancy oak bed . - She said she was having chest pain . - I never told you any of that ! - How could you know this ? - She begged you to dial 911 . But she was always calling out for you , wasn 't she , barry ? You weren 't there . How could you know what happened ? How ? Doesn 't matter . What matters is , you 've got to stop blaming yourself . If you don 't , you 'll eat yourself into an early grave for no reason . You 're looking in my head ! Stop it ! - Don 't look in there . - You don 't have to do it , barry . Leave me alone ! It wasn 't your fault . Jonesy ? Hey , how are you doing , henry ? What 's that you say ? Are you going deaf ? How are you doing ? You know . Ssdd . Well , yeah , of course . Hey , you know , i was thinking if you were free this weekend we might go see duddits . Yeah , absolutely . He 's been on my mind a lot too . It 's been a long time . It 's open ! I gotta go . I got a thing here . I 'll see you saturday . Yeah , right . See you saturday . So , mr . Defuniak do you know we 're both escapees from maine ? You 're from pittsfield . Do you know what happens to scholarship students caught cheating on exams ? You had the flu that day , didn 't you , david ? You didn 't take the exam ? You missed the test . And since you were ill , why not write me an essay instead ? 3000 words on the short-term results of the norman conquest . - Go get started . - Yes , sir . Better to be from pittsfield than go back to it . Thank you , sir . How did you know ? You weren 't even there that day . Sometimes i just know . Hello . This probably won 't work . Never start that way with a car salesman . We love challenges . Pete moore . In one hour i 'm showing a house in fryeburg . It 's a big commission . And i just lost my damn car keys . Could you possibly make me duplicates ? - That takes at least a day . - Oh , boy , i just knew it ! Easy , trish . Maybe i can help . I 'm always good at finding things . - Did i tell you my name ? I don 't remember ... - i guessed . Now , let 's find those keys . - Hey , rachel . - Hey , pete . - Miss , i looked again . I couldn 't find them . - Okay . I need your help . You had the coffee in your hand , bought aspirin went to your car , realized the keys were gone . - That everything ? - Yes . Look . This is gonna seem weird , but it 's just a thing i do to help me think . You bought a candy bar before the aspirin . Mars bar . Yours , right ? One more question . If i find your keys , will you let me buy you dinner ? West wharf ? 6 : 30 ? Best fried clams in the state ? It 's right on your way back . Sure . Okay . - That 'd be nice . - All right . So you got here . You opened your purse . Coffee , candy and aspirin , you 're juggling it all around . And that 's when you dropped your keys . It 's just luck , is all . Thank you . - West wharf , right ? Half past six ? - You got it . Another fuckarow . - Jones . - How are you doing ? - Hey , beaver . Same shit , different day . - Same shit , different day . - Wanna talk ? - No , you 're trying to get home . - What 's up ? - Really , i got nothing . Go home . - Wait , jonesy ? - Yeah , beav ? - You be careful . - Be careful of what ? Wish i knew . What did you say ? I didn 't say anything . Right . Sorry . - Somebody call an ambulance ! - It won 't do any good . I looked away for one second . Then i heard a thump . What happened ? Oh , my god ! Professor jones ! I just saw him . He can 't die ! Clear ! No good . Flatline . Hit it again ! Clear ! - What do you think ? - I think it 's no good . I think he 's gone . Watch out for ister gay . Jonesy , don 't try to lift that stuff . - Just go up to the cabin . I 'll get that . - Here , here , look . Big jacket . - Beaver , i 'm going in ! - All right , i 'll see you in a second ! Watch the beer . - Got blown last night . - Good for you . - First time ? - Bite my bag . Met some lady at bingo , went back to her place , turned into a nice fuckaree . - As opposed to a fuckarow . - Obviously . Though i 've had perfectly good fuckarees turn into fuckarows in a flash . - Try viagra . - Viagra ? I 'm practically at full salute all day . I 'm ... what do you call it ? Privatic ? Prag ... prasmatic ? Henry will know . - You 're thinking of fourth grade . - You 're having wood problems ? - You haven 't tried it , have you ? - Hell , no ! Drop that little blue bomb , you 're hard as a louisville slugger for 12 hours . Twelve hours ? I 'm talking yastrzemski . You don 't have to need it to love it . Bingo ? Did you say bingo , like the game in church basements ? - There 's trim there . - Beaver ! I thought my deal was pathetic . - You just watch . That 's your job . - I 'm fine . H , you been thinking about duddits more than usual ? Remember we were gonna go see him that weekend ? - I remember . - Then i got hit . I gotta tell you something weird . The night i got hit , i was standing there and across the street , i saw duddits . Just like he was that day we first saw him back in derry . He was calling out for help and everyone was ignoring him . Then he looked over at me . He looked directly at me . And he motioned for me to come to him . You believe i saw him , don 't you ? Yes , sir , i do . Duddits loves me , i know that . He loves us all . He would die before he 'd ever hurt us . So why was he calling me into the street to get hit ? Maybe there 's more to the story we don 't get yet . - You don 't know shit . - Name it ! I 'll name it after we come up with a small wager . - 50 bucks . - What 's the subject ? In the movies , when people wake up together they immediately start kissing and going at it . But they never get up first , take a leak and brush their goddamn teeth . Which is pretty much necessary when you wake up . What 's it called when you got a constant woody ? - You mean priapism . - See ? I 'm practically priasmic . Priapismic . - Whatever ! It 's hard . - That 's what you 're betting on ? No , i can name the one movie where they acknowledge the scuzzy facts of life . - I 'll give you a quarter . - A quarter from you . 50 bucks from you . - Promised land . - Promised land ? Never heard of it . Meg ryan and what 's his name ? Reefer sutherland . - Kiefer . - From , i don 't know , 1988 or something ? So meg ryan wakes up in the morning and says , " where 's the cat ? " And he says , " what cat ? " and she says , " the cat that shit in my mouth . " That will be 50 small . - Bullshit ! You made it up . - Could beaver make that up ? You can have that priceless piece of cinematic trivia absolutely free . I 'm filing that in the " who-gives-a-shit " section of my memory warehouse . - What 's the memory warehouse ? - You don 't remember ? - I must 've forgot . - You forgot ? - Just remind me . Don 't give me shit . - It 's in his head . We 've all got one . - Hasn 't that place been condemned ? - Not yet . It 's so crowded i have to throw something out every time i learn something new . When i got my new laptop i had to throw out all my files of rock ' n ' roll lyrics . My warehouse was washed away in a flood about 10 years ago . I didn 't know they had enough beer in maine for a flood . Jonesy , if that really is your name what do you do with the discarded files ? - I burn them . - You threw away the lyrics to " blue bayou " ? - No . No , if i really can 't let go of something i sneak it back to an office where i keep my secret stuff . Where do you keep the stuff on duddits ? He 's got a special section all his own on the third level . I can 't stop thinking about the duds lately . How about you guys ? It 's this place . He 's all around here , even though he 's never been here . This is our 20th year coming out here to hole in the wall . And fuck me , freddy , here 's to 20 more . Twenty more . Here 's to duddits our dreamcatcher . Wish he was here . To the duds . - To douglas cavell . - To duddits . Why is tina schlossinger 's pussy on the wall of tracker brothers ? Because i said so . It 's a picture . - Have you seen it ? - No but the kid who sits behind me in shop , he saw it . Tracker brothers is deserted . You don 't want to see the homecoming queen 's pussy ? Don 't come . Fuck me , freddy ! Some kid 's shirt . - So ? - It 's new ! Scooby-doo . " I belong to douglas cavell . " " If the boy i belong to is lost , please bring him to 19 maple lane , derry , maine . " Must belong to one of those kids from the retard academy . Come on . Eat it . Eat it . Eat it and you can go . Hey , you guys ! Quit it ! Just fucking quit it ! What are you doing ? You 're trying to make him eat that ? What 's wrong with you ? Got it . I 'll make him eat this dog turd , then he can go . You go now . Unless you want half . Take a hike , girls , while you have the chance . Piss off . That 's your final warning . - You better watch it ! - Why is that ? - I know who you are . - I 'm trembling with fear . - You 're richie grenadeau , the quarterback ! - So ? What will people say when we tell them what we caught you doing ? You won 't tell anybody anything because you 'll be dead . - Get ready , pete . - Give the word , henry . Pete can fly . When you come for us , all we have to do is get in your way . I can 't catch that little dick ? You know who that is ? That 's pete moore . That 's right , fat-ass . Pete moore . No one can catch him . He 's going straight to his house to tell his mother . She 'll call the cops and then we 'll see . - You know him , is that it ? - Never saw him . Then why ask for trouble ? I mean , look at this moron ! - He likes this attention . - How do you know what he likes ? Come on , you dickweeds ! - You want to fight us ? - Yes ! Yes ! I 'm gone , henry . Just say the word . - Why ? You 'll lose ! Why ? - Because you can 't do that ! It 's wrong ! And i 'm gonna tell the world ! Tell everybody ! - You want us to leave , is that it ? - No ! Let 's kick their asses ! Let 's go . We 'll get him later . You know that . Get you all later . It 's okay . You can stop now . Do something . Somebody ! If i do and you tell anybody , i 'll never hang with you guys again . I never knew beav could sing . - Beaver , that 's beautiful . - I mean it . Not one word . Eaver ! You 've got a fan . This yours ? Douglas cavell . That 's your name , right ? I duddits . - What ? - I duddits ! - Duddits ? - Duddits . Duddits , we got to get you home . Hey , guys ! Come here ! Leave the kid there . Stand right here , duddits . Right here with scooby , okay ? Jesus christ bananas ! No way is that tina jean schlossinger . Maybe her grandmother . Good going , beav . Holy god . We came all the way here just for that ? No . We came for him . Hey , pete . You forgot the dogs . Weather moving in . Double storm . Alberta clipper first , maybe eight inches with a nor 'easter on its tail . - Get on back to the cabin , henry . - Heading straight there , mr . G. - Don 't mess around . - No , sir . Easy , fella . Easy . You 're okay . You 're all right . Thank god . Thank god . Gee , thank god ! I 'm lost . I 've been lost in the woods since yesterday . Let 's get you inside . Get you warm . - How would that be ? - Sure . Here , let me get that . - Rick mccarthy . - Gary jones . But it 's jonesy to everybody . Our damn cell phones are on the blink now , so i can 't call for help but our car will be back soon . I didn 't think i 'd make it . I lost the folks i was with . You saved me , that 's for sure . What 's that ? It 's a dreamcatcher . Indian charm . Catches nightmares keeps them away . Keeps you safe down here . I 've had enough nightmares . Been doing that all night . I ate some berries in the dark . I think they must have upset me . I know what you 're thinking . Anyone who drinks at 11 a.m. Needs to take the cure , but i only do it here . In the real world , i never drink till after 5 : 00 and if it ever does , i 'm on the wagon for life . Glad to hear it . What 's the matter with you ? About six months ago , the day jonesy got hit i did something terrible with a patient . Humiliated him . Drove him out of the office . Barry neiman . Couple days ago , i saw his picture in the paper . He ate himself to death . Mind if i don 't use that story next time i 'm trying to sell a mustang ? Henry , you were a lead balloon long before this porker munched his way to eternity . Thanks . You 're a real comfort . You got a real delicate touch to you . Here you go , rick , buddy . That will fix you up . Jesus christ bananas ! Some fuckarow this is turning into ! - Thanks a lot , pete . - Yeah , i think i got it all . What happened to you ? Hi . Joe clarendon . Call me beaver . Rick here had a bad night in the woods . Welcome . - Is that frostbite ? - No , i get the same thing from peanuts . It 's allergy . Grilled cheese , anyone ? - No , the soup 's fine for me , thanks . - I 'll bite . Sail it over here . My mother used to feed me pea soup when i was feeling ... bitch in a buzz saw ! I 've heard some mighty burps in my time , but that 's the blue ribbon . I am so embarrassed . Rick ate some berries in the woods . Oh , my god ! Oh , my god , that 's awful ! I 'm so sorry ! Rick , buddy , don 't worry about it . There 's more room out than in , anyway . What have you been eating , woodchuck turds ? Know what i think ? I think you need to lie down and take you a little nap . You know , i bet you 're right . I 'm just tired , that 's all . - Come on . - My hat . Beaver ? In here . Thank you for taking me in . Thank you both . - Shit , anybody would have . - Maybe . Maybe not . All right , this is in case you have to urk if you can 't get to the bathroom , which is the third door to your left . If you go in the first , you 'll take a shit in the closet . If you need anything , we 're outside . Fuck me , give me some air ! We got any gas masks handy ? We need a biohazard team in here . - Wanna hear what will freak you out more ? - Not really . You know his huge stomach ? When he got here , his stomach was normal , but his chest was out to here ! I wish henry was here . He 's a shrink , not an internist . He went to med school . Did you ? I thought about it . You better get a run at it . - Shit ! - Watch it ! What the hell ? - Pete , are you okay ? - No , i broke my leg ! Man , my damn leg ! Okay . Hang on . Hang on a second . - I 'm caught ! I can 't ... - god ! - God . - Henry ! A little help here ! Hang on , pete . Hang on . - Okay . Here comes the seat belt . - I just opened that beer . I got you . How 's your leg ? Well , it ain 't broken . It 's just locked up , is all . You don 't suppose he got exposed to radiation ? I saw that once in a movie . Guy ended up bald as telly what 's-his-fuck . This guy 's got plenty of hair . But that red mark got bigger while i was watching it . - What are you doing ? - Peanut butter calms me down . - Somebody else might want to use that jar . - I 'll leave some . Beav . Beaver . Criminettlies ! I think it 's a woman . I ought to warn you . I 'm gonna strangle this broad . - I 'd guess she 's already dead . - I 'll strangle her anyway . She almost got us both killed . Hello ! Here we come , ma 'am . Don 't be startled . Hello ? Forget it , h . She 's gone . Hello ! Ma 'am , can you hear me ? Are you okay ? Can you hear me ? I wonder if maybe that 's how they say hello around here . Listen , miss road kill , you almost got us dead . Say something . I have to find rick . - Okay . - Rick . Yeah . Fuck me , freddy . - What 's all that red stuff on their fur ? - Just like mccarthy 's cheek . - I never saw anything like this before . - Even the bears look scared . - Of what ? Where are they going ? - It 's not where that worries me it 's what are they running away from ? What the hell ? This could be perfect . They can get stinky to a hospital . Hey , you guys ! - We need some help ! Got a sick guy inside ! - This area is under temporary quarantine . - Stay where you are . - What quarantine ? - We got a sick guy down here ! - We need your help here ! - We got a real sick guy here ! - Take him with you now ! Glad you 're okay . This situation will be resolved in 24 to 48 hours . Kiss my bender ! I gotta ask you , old buddy . Because i 'm confused . - Is this ssdd or not ? - Definitely not . Different shit today , pete . And a pretty weird day so far , if you want to know . Over here . There you go . Easy . It 's nine miles to hole in the wall . I think i can manage it . I 'll bring the snowmobile back and get you both . Now , pete , you listen to me . Don 't go back to the car for beer . - Stay with her . Keep her warm . - Right hand to god , dr . D. Henry ! If we die before you get back promise you 'll tell everybody she wasn 't my date . I 'm telling you , jonesy , i don 't like this at all . This is turning into a double fuckarow . A real jobba-nobba . - Rick , you okay ? - I 'm a little sick , fellas . - I just need to make a little room . - Mccarthy , rick , open up , man . - Go away ! - Open the door or we break it down . - Can 't a man have some privacy ? - Rick , where are you bleeding from ? Bleeding ? I 'm not bleeding . - Let 's do it . - I 'm not positive i wanna go in there . What if he 's dying ? Scooby-dooby-doo , we got some work to do now . On three . Ready ? One ... two ... hold it ! What if we just bounce off ? - No bounce , no play . - Right . No bounce , no play . One ... and a two ... three ! Oh , fuck ! Oh , man ! Fuck ! I don 't want to see this ! I can 't see this . - Shut up a minute . Mr. Mccarthy ? Rick ? - Is he still alive ? I don 't know . Rick ? Rick , are you ... ? Oh , man ! Jonesy , if he can still do that , he must be alive . Can you hear me ? I think he 's dead . Bullshit ! He dropped a clinker ! I heard it . - I don 't think that was a clinker . - That 's enough , snap out of it ! - Oh , my god ! - My god ! - No ! - No ? Good move ! It 's trapped . Got nowhere to go but the septic tank . Oh , shit ! - Listen , beaver , we 're gonna change places . - What ? - One of us is gonna go to the shed . - No way ! Shut up and listen ! There 's friction tape there . You go get it , come back . We 'll tape the lid down . Then we 're gonna get the hell out of here ! - You get the tape , jonesy . - Don 't be brave , beav . You 're faster than me . I 'll sit on thumper . No , if it does get out , you can 't fight it . Not with your hip . Oh , my god ! Goddamn it ! Go ! - And beav ? - Yeah ? Sit tight , buddy . Okay . All right . Okay . Shit ! Earth to jonesy ! Come in , jonesy ! Jonesy . Jonesy . Calm down now . Okay . Okay . Okay , here it is . Okay . Find the damn tape ! Where is it ? Coming , beav ! Beaver ! Beav ! I got the ... what the ... jonesy , get out of here ! Beaver . - Get out ! Shut the door ! - No . Run , jonesy . You killed him . You killed beaver . You killed him , you fuck ! What do you want ? The men call the red stuff ripley , after the broad in the alien movies . We eradicate the animals as they flee the blue zone . And the populace ? We 're bringing civilians to gosselin 's . We 'll detain them till we figure this out . And owen ? This time the ets belong to you . That 's right , bucko . - You 'll be blue boy leader . - Finally . - How many left ? - About a hundred . Yeah . Not nearly enough for a serious incursion . My guess is , it 's a crash-landing . They 've never picked terrain like this before . Or cold weather . What 's your call ? The biggest threat is them getting out of our net . Crash-landing or not they 'll try to get out and spread the infection . I always say they never visited a world they wouldn 't rather own . They 're up to their old tricks . Using a standard grayboy look with the innocent doggy eyes and smooth baby-butt skin . They project what they think we want to see . But i 've had a look at the real thing . You wouldn 't want it marrying your sister . - Difference of opinion about the ripley . - Really ? Who has an opinion ? - Who do you think ? - General matheson . - Three-star general matheson . - Three ? - When did you see him ? - They called me in yesterday . What 's the opinion of those enlightened cocksuckers who 've never been near an et ? They say the fungus doesn 't take hold in all victims . Some of them get over it . Really ? And what about the shit weasels ? The ones blasting out the basement door ? Does matheson think folks get over one of those puppies ? Their theory is , they 'll only grow in a small percentage of the exposed population . Do you like that theory , bucko ? I think it 's crap . So if you thought someone had been exposed and you had them in your grasp ... - i wouldn 't want them walking out to wander as they wish . - Bucko , i think we 're on the same page . Pissing in the same latrine . If the ripley gets out of this pine-tree paradise ... well , it just can 't be allowed to do that . I 've quarantined the entire area . - Nothing leaves alive . - Roger that , boss . Come ! Got maples here , boss . - Corporal maples , sir . I mean , boss . - I know who you are , maples . I handpicked every man in blue boy group . Sometimes i wonder about my judgment . - Yes , sir . I 'm sorry , boss . - Do you know the blue unit catechism ? - Yes , the b.u.c. For all buckos . - Is blue unit part of regular army ? - No , boss . Better . - How does blue unit operate ? Under the radar . We do not salute , display rank , say " sir . " a force unto ourselves . - Regular army compared to blue unit ? - Pussies . - Under what rules does blue unit operate ? - Rules of combat . That 's right , laddie . When a soldier disobeys a superior 's orders , he puts everyone at risk . And is to be punished immediately by appropriate command personnel . That 's me . Capisce ? Good . Now answer me one question and you can boogie out of here . But you have to answer honestly . You were on containment detail at 0600 this morning , sector 14 of blue zone . Did you allow a young woman and her 4-year-old daughter to exit the zone in their own vehicle on hickam valley road ? Colonel curtis , she hadn 't been in the zone . She made a wrong turn . She couldn 't have been contaminated . You know this for a fact ? Or because she told you so ? - For a fact , boss . - Scout 's honor ? Can you raise your hand and tell me honestly that you know this for a fact ? Then do it , maples . Swear on it . Scout 's honor . Scout 's honor . Stop your blatting , laddie-buck ! You just avoided a court-martial , boy . You lie to me again , you 'll be facing a firing squad . - Get him out before i change my mind . - Let 's get him out of here . Sentry ! - Jesus , abe . - I warned him . Could have gotten off with a slap on the wrist . - Instead of taking his whole hand ? - He crossed the curtis line ! He came into my house , told me lies . - You think i 'm crazy , owen ? - A little . I lost my temper there . But that little worm did something worse . The pretty mom he let pass this morning ? She 's down at the barn right now crawling with the ripley . Twenty-five years , owen . Twenty-five years i 've been going out to fight these alien bastards show them they picked the wrong place , knocked on the wrong fucking door . And frankly , laddie , the tank is running a little low . Luckily for me , there 's one bit of good news in this blizzard of bullshit . I have you . To lead the assault today and to take over for me tomorrow . - What are you talking about , abe ? - It 's my last dance , owen . From now on , you will lead the band . - You know where i got that ? - John wayne . That 's right . He gave it to me . And now i 'm giving it to you . - Abe , i don 't know how to ... - let 's not get all girlie with each other . - Just tell me how we do it . - We go in fast and hard . - How do we come out ? - Clean and smiling . Honey , i 'm home . That 's a good idea . Catch a little shuteye . Save your energy for those horrendous farts ! Well , it 's very nice of you to say so . I find you very attractive also . You 're one of those rare women who can handle the full-size ford expedition . The truck that handles like a luxury car . A really big luxury car . But seriously , folks , there is one issue i 'd like to bring up just in case i should , you know , kick the bucket out here turn into a goddamn petesicle . Not that i think that 's inevitable . I 'm sure henry or jonesy or beaver will be coming to get us soon . They 're my friends . We 're all best friends . Now , ma 'am , i 'll be very candid with you about this so please , don 't get freaked out or think that i 'm some kind of weirdo who you shouldn 't meet for the best fried clams in maine . Just some innocent fried clams at the west wharf ! You see , the four of us , best friends we all have this other friend by the name of duddits . And our friend duddits , well , he 's not your average old buddy . One day , a long time ago , he gave us all this kind of gift . It 's this ... how shall i put it ? This ability . This ability to know things to talk to each other without talking at all , just mind-to-mind . Do you see what i 'm getting at ? I knew you would . Lately , i 've been having this dream and in the dream , i understand how duddits could give us a gift like that . I think maybe our friend duds is not from this planet . I think duddits is from somewhere else and he came here to prepare us for something . It 's crazy . Talking shit about the only perfect person i ever knew . He 's so goddamned good . I can 't believe he 's a human . I should be singing his praises , not questioning what galaxy he 's ... i gotta pee . That 's what i should be doing . Here 's to you , duds . The highest civilian decoration . Lord , i will never drink again . Let me get this straight . Yesterday you want to call it quits , throw in the towel , pull the plug , curtains . Today , you 're begging , praying . Couple more hours . Couple more miles . Make up your mind . Jonesy ! Way to go , motherfucker ! Here you come to save the day ! What the hell ? Who 's mr . Gray ? What are you trying to tell me , jonesy ? You 're not jonesy . What was that , mr . Jones ? What did we just pass on the road ? - Are you speaking to me ? - Yes , i am , mr . Jones . Or is it jonesy ? That 's what your friends call you , isn 't it ? Let 's be friends . - Why are you letting me live ? - I 'm borrowing you . - We 're going to take a little journey . - Beaver never hurt a soul and you killed him . He had nothing in his head . I 've found something useful in yours . - Fuck you ! - I know what that expression means . I 've studied the foul language section of your memory warehouse . - Rather distasteful , i must say . - How about this , mr . Gray ? Eat shit and die . Why did you call me mr . Gray ? Watch out for ister gay . Someone told you about me . Who told you about me ? If you want to know , why don 't you read my mind ? Surprisingly , you 're able to keep things from me i don 't understand it . But i 'm sure i 'll figure it out soon . Oh , pete , jesus ! Motherfucker tried to bite my dick off , jonesy . I always thought it would be my ex-wife did that . Let 's get you to some help . Can you still see the line , buddy ? - I don 't need the line to get to gosselin 's . - No , i know that , but if we didn 't want to go to gosselin 's , how would you get us out to 95 ? 95 ? Who gives a shit ? I 'm hurting here , jonesy . What 's wrong with you ? - Wait a minute , you 're not ... - shut up , pete . You 're too messed up to know what you 're saying . Too late for that . Pete , i need you to get onto the snowmobile right now . Who the fuck are you ? You sound like one of those james bonds ! This has to do with the fucking eel , doesn 't it ? You 're not ... stop it ! I 'll get him to help . Pete , tell him what he wants to know . Now , pete , which way to l-95 ? I need to go to massachusetts . My , my . That is a gift . Who taught you that ? You 're gonna be a big help , pete . Climb aboard . - Show 's over out there , buddy . Let me in . - Let me in . What have you got in that part of your mind , professor ? Your memories are out here in the warehouse , aren 't they ? I want to know who warned you about me . And who taught pete that nifty trick ? I 'm sure the answers are here . It 'll just take me a while to find them . - To find them . - Think about letting me in . - It 's the polite thing to do . - Polite thing to do . Beav ! What is this ? Beav . Shit !

How we doing , bucko ? - Right here , boss . Fast and hard . - Wouldn 't have it any other way , blue boy . Sir ? I see it . - Don 't hurt us . - We 're dying . - There is no infection here . - Whose radio is that ? It 's not the radio . They 're putting it into our heads . - We are helpless . - There it is , gentlemen . - There 's no infection here . - Directly into our heads . This gives you an idea what we 're up against . If anybody 's thinking , " those poor , helpless little folk all naked and unarmed beside their crashed intergalactic winnebago what kind of a dog , what kind of a monster could hear that heartbreak and go in just the same ? " - Well , i 'm that dog . I 'm that monster . - We are helpless . We are dying . These mothers are as harmless as a fox in a henhouse . And i 'm here to kick some ass ! Are you with me ? - Yes , boss ! - Roger that , boss . Right on , boss . Don 't hurt us . I have a visual . Holy shit ! Damn , look at the size of that . Blue boy group , this is blue boy leader . Target imminent . Move to level 4 readiness . Gentlemen , lock and load . Hellfires are hot . Sing it out , owen ! Blue boy group , this is blue boy leader . Clean up the forest and get rid of this trash ! - Don 't hurt us . - Please , don 't hurt us . - There is no infection here . - We are helpless . - Fire at will ! - Fire ! Owen , get them out of there ! It 's gonna blow ! Blue boy group , withdraw at once . I repeat , cease firing and back off ! - We can get them ! - It 's self-destructing . Back off ! - Blue boy group , get out of there ! - We 're on top of it ! Owen , pull out now ! - Pull out ! Get out of there ! - Pull out ! Jonesy , i 've been thinking about our friend . Our scooby-doo buddy . For a long time i thought he was sent to us to warn us about something . - I could never figure what it was . - Don 't talk about him . Not till today . It was this , right now . - He wanted to warn us . - Go ahead , pete . Tell me about your friend . - Did he show you that nifty trick ? - No . Jonesy 's right . - Come on , pete . Let 's talk . - Bite my bag , motherfucker ! All right , pete , i 'll bite . Your bag and everything else . No , no ! You bastard ! No ! Pete . Don 't talk to him ! Get out of there ! - What 's up ? - Thank god you came by , governor . I 'm broke down here and fearing for my life . That 's a good-looking dog . - Where you headed ? - Gosselin 's . Any chance you 're going near there ? That 's where i 'm going . Well , i believe your tailgate has come open . Let 's take a look . I see you have some cargo you 're taking to blue base . Got a treat for you , Ike . All you can eat . Eat all the red stuff . Good doggy . Yes . Good boy . Have your fill . Tasty , tasty . Eat all you want ... jonesy . What are you up to ? Jonesy ! Oh , god ! Halt or we 'll fire ! You cannot leave the quarantine zone ! - Halt ! - I think i just about halted here . Come with me , owen . I 'll show you things you 'll wish you 'd never seen . - How long we gotta be here ? - It 'll be all right . - I demand to see my lawyer ! - There must be something they can do . Don 't worry , you 'll be fine . - When do we get out ? - Within hours . - You can 't do this to people in america ! - I told you to stay over there ! - My wife ... - government 's doing everything they can to get you out of here . Please don 't worry . It 's all right . We 're doing everything to make sure you 're safe . We 'll get you back to your homes within hours . All clear . Can i help you , sir ? What 's your name ? - Henry . Dr. Henry devlin . - A doctor ? Good . We need doctors in there . Come on , laddie , i 'll buy you a cup . - You , sir , where you from ? - Boston . Beantown ? Great city . We 'll have you back there in no time . Maybe by morning . Hurry up , bucko . You see that crud on the faces of children you know why i relish a turn in the country like we had today . You were excellent out there , o . It made me feel very proud to ... abe ? Abe , you okay ? Abe ? Yeah , i 'm fine . I 'm fine . I must be getting too old for this shit . I don 't know what the hell that was about . It 's the only way , owen . We 've got to cauterize the site . They 've all got to die . It 's the only way . But we don 't know that . The studies point to the strong possibility of recovery for many exposed subjects . The studies show squat , that 's what they show . If matheson had been in my spot for the last quarter-century you 'd have never made it to your first jerk-off . Those gray bastards would have had you for lunch back in armpit , kentucky . Some get better . At least half will be over it in a few days ... which ones , mother teresa ? Can you guarantee they won 't take it home like a present for the family ? I 'll tell you what you should be worried about . What should be on your mind . Not these few unfortunates . What you should be worried about is a hitchhiker . - What ? - A hitchhiker . Our greatest fear is that a grayboy would catch a ride with somebody and would carry them out of here , without being consumed . To scatter the infection , like johnny-fucking-appleseed . - Are you sure there isn 't such a person ? - No . But i am sure that if there is one he won 't get out . Not with the net my boys put up around the blue zone . And if we do a thorough job on the ones we 've got . If we don 't get gooey about the little picture when our job is taking care of the big one . Capisce ? Owen , if you think this is easy for me , you 're crazier than my mother was . Those poor schmucks . They drive chevrolets , shop at wal-mart never miss an episode of friends . These are americans . The idea of slaughtering americans it just turns my stomach . But i 'll do it . I 'll do it because it needs to be done . So if we start at 2 , we can be done by 2 : 30. and it 's all behind us . Except for the dreams . Yeah , except for them . What are you gonna tell rita about what you did here ? What are you gonna tell katrina when she 's old enough to ask ? You know me , don 't you ? I don 't remember when we met , but you know me . We don 't have time to screw around . You 've got two problems . - One you know about , one you don 't . - Go ahead . Your mentor , colonel curtis , he 's gone insane from hunting aliens for 25 years . Now he wants you to help him kill hundreds of innocent people . - Who are you ? - Me ? Talk about that later , once we get out of here . You 're predictable . You won 't let me burn on this fence any more than you 'll help curtis kill those people . What you 're thinking now is whether that digital sat-scan transmitter in your duffle bag will let you get through to somebody . Somebody named general matheson . " Sometimes we have to kill , but our real job is to save lives . " Your father was a great soldier . Those were his last words . You carry his picture with you always . Tell me everything . You 'll save these people . When we 're done talking , get on the transmitter , contact matheson . Cavalry rides in . That takes care of problem number one . Now comes the hard part . You think the infection 's been contained , that there 's no hitchhiker . You 're wrong . He 's riding with my best friend on earth . A guy named gary jones . And he 's out there . You and i don 't get after him right away , he 'll get out of my range and some kind of shit is gonna hit the planetary fan . Our nightmare hitchhiker . And all dr . Mystery wants is a free pass so he can catch his friend . - Very convenient . - I 'm saying you ought to hear his story . Okay . Where is he ? Had him taken to the tractor shed . Okay . I 'll check him out and we can compare notes . Whatever you say , boss . Come on , come on . Time 's a-wasting . All right , lad , open up . Dr. Boston ? Are you in here ? I 'm here . Where i 've been put . A prisoner on my own damn property . Let 's go ! Come on , let 's go . Get in ! You almost ran me down . Figured you 'd read my mind and get out of the way . Blue unit , stand down . You are under regular army command . Put down your weapons at once . Your mission is rescinded . This is no longer a blue unit operation . Put down your arms . Repeat , put down your arms . General matheson has assumed command . Okay , owen . Okay . You just drove over the curtis line . - Where we going ? - South . All i know right now . Just get me in range of jonesy we 'll know everything we need to know . That 's some gun . Can i have a look ? - Kind of flashy for a guy like you , isn 't it ? - It 's a gift . I know . Where are you , jonesy ? Pick up the phone . Call 1-800-henry . Hello ? Jonesy ! Jesus christ , i knew it was you . Where 's he taking you ? Massachusetts ? He is ? Duddits ? Okay , i will . You hang in there , jonesy . Jonesy ? He hung up . Give me back my gun . - We gotta go to derry . - That where they 're going ? No , they 're going towards massachusetts . We need duddits . Jonesy says mr . Gray is afraid of duddits . Your buddy , he 's still alive after all this time with mr . Gray ? Yeah , he 's immune . I think it 's because he died . He got hit by a car and his heart stopped . Twice . I don 't think he even knows it . He came back from the dead . Must have changed him somehow . It 's almost like duddits saw this whole thing coming . Is that it ? Jonesy told me it was duddits who drew him into the accident . If we catch him , we 're gonna have to kill him . You know we have to do it . It 's the only way to stop mr . Gray assuming we can catch him . When was the last time you saw duddits ? Long time ago . Years . What makes you so sure he can help ? Duddits can do anything . I didn 't understand that then , but i think it 's always been true . He 's the one who made us like this . - Like what ? - You know , weird . He 's been waiting for you . Blizzard slowed us up . Henny , henny . Henny . I miss you , henny . I miss you . Henny . Long time , henny . - My god , roberta , what is it ? - Lymphocytic leukemia . I 'm gonna let you take him , but i have to tell you why . Just now , when he was getting ready henry he was so excited . Like he hasn 't been in such a long time . I think that if he 's with you , he might die happy instead of in this awful room . Be sure the parka stays on tight . Cold devastates him . The medication and instructions are in here . Bye , mom . Goodbye , duddie . Be a good boy . Now , go save the world . I 'm all right , laddie . They haven 't got enough courage to take my trailer . Not yet , anyway . What 've we got ? They 're leaving derry , maine , heading south on 95. toward massachusetts . Massachusetts ? Stay with it , bucko . General matheson . Come in , please . This is very nice , abe . Been home through some rough times . Was there something we hadn 't covered ? I don 't think i got to say before how much i respect the work you 've done . It was with sincere regret ... herman ... may i call you herman ? We may not agree on all the strategic initiatives , but we do agree on this : I 'm past it . Burned out . Just needed a push , that 's all . Should have quit after that mess in montana . Even i don 't trust my judgment anymore . Oh , yeah ... my techies tell me we 're getting some electronics reading hot from in here . Yes , i 've been talking to the wife on my sat phone . I don 't know if you 've ever met barbara . She 's been after me for years to retire . She 's very happy , i can tell you that . I 'll have everything shut down in an hour . If that 's soon enough . That will be fine . How do you turn off the goddamn lights ? Maybe you shouldn 't have been so fast to kill that trooper . You 're making yourself at home . You have no idea , jonesy . Tell me how you like this : " Maybe you shouldn 't have been so fast to kill that trooper . " not bad ? Oh , don 't like that , gary , do you ? Ownzy . He 's in a police car now . He 's in a police car now . Can you see where they are , duds ? Ownzy . He 's in ister gay . Mr. Gray . That 's right , duds , he is in mr . Gray . " Ister gay " is mr . Gray . We gotta save this girl . Save the world ? Not the world , duds , a girl . We 'll save the world some other time . Ister gay ? You already knew . Where 's he going , duds ? Where is mr . Gray taking jonesy ? Ister gay , he want war . - War ? - Not war , water . Mr. Gray wants water . I know where he 's going . - He 's going to the quabbin reservoir . - What 's quabbin ? It supplies drinking water for all of boston . What ? One worm kills the world . One worm kills the world ? Oh , my god . One worm . Back at our cabin , i saw the worms that come out of these weasels . Mr. Gray must want to get one into the boston drinking supply . Just one worm infects the whole world ? - Are we going right ? - Yes . Take the 495 to the mass pike . It 's not far . You 're doing great , buddy . Now , are you ready to try something hard ? I want to ask you something hard . Yes , henny . Good . Can you talk to jonesy ? Can you make him hear you ? Ownzy and ister gay . Duddits . I knew it . I knew it . He 's been here all along . Waiting . Jonesy ? It appears we didn 't meet by accident . We owe it to our friend , duddits . - I don 't know what you mean . - No ? Maybe not . Maybe your clever friend didn 't want you to know what he was up to . That 's why you had nothing in the warehouse about me . Duddits didn 't bother to tell you what job he had in mind for you . It doesn 't matter . His little scheme didn 't work . Did it , Ike ? No , no . We 're almost there . What was it your poetry file had to say ? I have promises to keep and miles to go before i sleep and miles to go before i sleep stop that chopper ! Punch it , dude . Don 't be a pussy . Thank you , gary jones . Go up around the reservoir . Aqueduct to boston starts in shaft 12 . Patience , bambino . Just up ahead . Stay here and take care of your friend . No matter what you hear . So long , doctor . Good doggy . Good girl . Shit ! You son of a bitch ! Wait . Wait . Go back to car , duddie . You 'll be safer there . Look out , jonesy . I knew you 'd come , henry . I knew you wouldn 't let me die . Who the fuck are you ? - Don 't you know me , h ? - I don 't know . I think i 'm gonna have to shoot you . Just to be sure . Well , maybe you 're right , my friend . I don 't know myself if mr . Gray is gone . He could be hiding in here somewhere waiting for his chance . Tell me something mr . Gray couldn 't possibly know . Tell me something only we would know . Ssdd . Not good enough . Well , you decide . Ask me anything . At tracker brothers , day we met duddits what was painted on the wall by the window ? No bounce ... no play . Hello lster gay . You . Ooby-ooby-doo we got some work to do now . Ister gay go away . No ! I duddits . H ? Jonesy . Jonesy , if that really is your name ... - that 'll be 50 small . - Bullshit . - I duddits . - I duddits . They 're my friends . We 're all best friends . Here 's to duddits , our dreamcatcher .

 I know it 's an important meeting . I 'm wearing a tie . But my car was on fire . Yes , fire . Flames of fire shooting out of the hood . And the auto club 's taking their sweet time getting here . What ? What I-I can 't hear ... hello ? Hello ? Okay , there . Can you hear me now ? Good . Maybe if I stand here long enough , we can have a full conversation . No , I don 't think it 's my crappy carrier , I think it 's my cheap , crappy phone . Just-just ... just tell Lou that I 'll be there as soon as they tow my car , okay ? All right , thank you . Diane , thank you . You 're the best . Wow . Nice car . Uh ... yeah . Yeah . It 's a 355 spider . You like cars ? I like this car . What 's not to like ? It 's a beauty . Eight cylinder , six-speed engine . Smooth grain leather . You know these things are assembled entirely by hand . You 're right . What 's not to like ? All right , call for a tow ? Just a , uh ... Yeah . Right here . Right . Where you want me to haul this steaming pile , garage or straight to the junkyard ? Garage would be fine . Thanks . Sorry . My car broke ... broke down . Hope you brought cash , Romeo . Your membership 's expired . What ? Man ... What 's going on ? Uh ... someone 's just hacked into our accounts . What ? What are you talking about ? We 're being robbed . They 've got a million . How ? Th-this is a restricted system . - Million and a half . - Stop them . I can 't . The United States Federal Reserve : $ 300 billion . A big marble building to keep track of it : $ 10 million Stealing $ 2 Million from the Man : Priceless That 's me . Jake Foley , I 'm in Tech Support . Security Clearance : Low . Very low . Then one day , it all changed . Life just got real interesting . James Bond , Napoleon Solo , Steve Austin . You never saw any of those guys count pennies for a tow . Okay , you can 't compare yourself to Steve Austin . He was a man barely alive . They had to rebuild him . Laugh it up . My auto repair estimates come in as bad as I think they are , I 'm gonna be the world 's first ride-sharing superspy . Okay , ( A ) ride sharing ? Hello ? It 's an idea whose time has come . And ( B ) eventually they 're gonna give you a company car . - What ? Really ? When ? - Oh , yeah , in a couple years . Oh , great . Well , maybe by then , Human Resources will have processed my R-12 form , and I 'll start getting paid . You know , I made more when I was de-fragging hard drives around here than I do fighting Uncle Sam 's enemies . And you know why ? Two words : Overtime . Yeah , uh , Uncle Sam 's enemies don 't punch a clock . Come on . This M.O. matches a cyber-criminal gang - we 've been tracking . - Ooh , guys . Our intel on them is limited . They 're pretty clever . This isn 't the Bedford Falls Savings Loan . This is the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States . The people of this country depend on us to keep their tax dollars safe from criminals , even the very clever ones . We have our best people on this . We 'll get a lead . We already have one . Look . This crest is from Ironhawk Knight Quest . Could be a fifth-level mage . Not really sure about the ... Ironhawk Knight Quest ? It 's an online role-playing game . Okay , thousands of people can play at the same time . I 'd put money on it you spend enough time poking around in that environment , you 're eventually gonna find this guy . Oh , you 're throwing fireballs at me now , is that how it 's gonna be ? Well , bring it on , little man . Is he still playing that on-line game ? He cut off my leg ! 18 hours and counting . This better be the guy . Please tell me we 're close . We are . We 're running a reverse IP lookup on that wizard , but the player is re-routing his signal through offshore data havens . We just have to keep him online a little longer . Not longer , you 're killing me . I haven 't slept , I haven 't showered , and I have one leg . Why don 't you just use that dagger thing ? You , go away . Now . Now . We 've got him . Oh . Thank god . Ow . Five , four , three , two , one . Get away from the desk , Dumont ! Hands where I can see them now . Come on ! I saw you on my security cameras . Your cover formation is sloppy . Your men have the weaver stance all wrong . I deserve better for my tax dollars . Jake ... - he 's erasing the hard drive . - What ? Don 't even try . It 's over . How 'd he do that ? That 's your tax dollars at work . You get what you pay for . Get him out of here . I want my lawyer Uh-oh . What 's wrong ? Well , it 's asking for a password . Can 't you just do your thing ? No , I can 't just do my thing 'cause the password 's not in the computer , it 's in his head . You know what I love about passwords ? It can take years to figure them out . You named your cell phone " Fionavar , " your mp-3 player " Earthsea , " your PDA " Gondor . " All your passwords are kings in those fantasy novels . Foley , you 're embarrassing yourself . Oh , now when I saw your hard drive was named " gormenghast , " now that really narrowed things down . 'Cause it could 've Titus groan , or it could 've been his dad lord sepulchrave ... It takes more than an underpaid tech grub to crack me . Well , then I-I pictured you at your computer with your little black chair and sunglasses . And I realized that your password could only be the Death Owl . You 're bluffing . Well , thanks , Death Owl , 'cause this underpaid tech grub just got you to hand over your password . Foley ... you 're talented , but when you wake up tomorrow you 're still gonna be the same government droid sellout . - You 're still gonna be in that cell . - Don 't bet on it . You know the difference between you and me ? I 've lived . I 've been to every continent , and I 've eaten every food , and I 've had hotter sex than you 'll ever know ... and when I get out with the sole mission to personally frag your ass for depriving me of that , you 're still gonna be the same thrift-store - clothes-wearing , six-dollar-haircut loser I see before me . Here 's what Jake found in Dumont 's computer . There are four other hackers in the ring . They don 't use their real names . The two virus engineers call themselves Clu and Bit . Telco specialist is Yori . And the one with the online handle " MacP " plans the jobs . He wants the others to meet him in Berlin in two days . They 're willing to risk a meeting this soon after robbing the Federal Reserve ? - What is he planning ? - Well , I suggest to place someone undercover in Dumont 's place and find out . - They 've never seen him ? - No , they never met in person . They 're so paranoid , they haven 't exchanged photos . It 's all e-mails , IRC chats , numbered Cayman accounts . What do we know about this Dumont ? Got a Ph.D. at 15 . Recruited to write software for Banatech . Six months in , he quits . Dumont accussed Banatch of stealing his ideas . He 's been underground ever since . All right , make a list . Who 's available , who 's qualified , who fits the profile . Ah , if ever an assignment screamed Agent Foley ... - I don 't think so , Jake . - Oh , why not ? I found Dumont , I cracked his hard drive . I can do this . No , Jake , we 're talking about going overseas and infiltrating a criminal gang . Agents train for years to do this type of duty . Yeah , but these aren 't drug dealers . They 're not terrorists . They 're nerds . They 're like ... they 're like nerds gone wild . These are my people . Okay , what 's your in ? I show up , wait for them to contact me . - Now when they do ? - Get them talking . - Wrong . - Don 't you want me to find out about the job ? Let the information come to you , Jake . - Observe and gather . - What if they 're not buying it ? What if they start asking me questions ? Well , you tell me . - I walk away . - You walk away . Where 's your primary safe house ? Lisberger apartments number 98 Alexanderplatz - Secondary . - 221-B Backer Strasse . Good . Okay , passport ... wallet ... euro dollars . - Wow , these are cool . - Jake . Right . I 'm listening . Your cell phone functions as a streaming video transmitter . Show us what they look like , okay ? - Where are you gonna keep it ? - Uh , my coat lining . No , it 's a cell phone . Right . It 's a phone . Treat it like a phone . Where 'd you go to school ? Carnegie Mellon for undergrad , cal tech for my masters , Doctorate at MIT and did my thesis on heuristic algorithms . Too much information . Never give them enough to catch you in a lie . Weapons . I can 't take any . That 's right . You 'll be alone and unarmed . Jake , I think I 've told you everything I can . From now on , your best defense , your only defense ... is knowing Dumont inside out . You have twelve hours to become him . Hi , I 'm Dumont . Dumont Yeah . That 's good . I 'm Dumont . Yeah , I ride bikes . Different one every day . Today ? Well , today 's the KTM-525 SX , Babe . Yeah . Like the wind . Oh ! Hey ! My car . Wir mochten mit ihnen sprechen . Commen sie mit German intelligence . You are under arrest . Look , I told you , my name is Kevin Flynn . I don 't know who this " Dumont " is . Don 't patronize us . Dumont is your online handle . We know you robbed the American Federal Reserve . And we know you 're working with at least four others , attacking systems , rerouting transfers , appropriating millions . And you will give us their names . I swear I don 't know what you 're talking about . Every nation in the european union has a jail cell ready for you . If you don 't cooperate , you may find yourself in every one of them . That 's a nice watch . We are not here to discuss watches . We want names . And we are quickly losing our patience . The building seems kind of empty . German Intelligence on some kind of a holiday or something ? Wal ... Walther PPK . I thought ... I thought James Bond was the only guy who still used one of those . Oh , you think you 're smart ? Think you can outsmart the bullet ? That 's a line from " Robocop " . What 's going on here ? You guys learn everything you know from movies ? We 're so busted ! Hey , way to ace the loyalty test , Dumont . I 'm Bit , this is Clu . Hey , who 'd you believe more ? Oh , clearly you 're both evil geniuses . Hey , this is 50,000 euros . That 's courtesy of McP . The only caveat is : spend it all by dawn . Is this some silent zen torture ? I was just thinking . Oh . That would explain the long silent patches . You 're a bright guy . Are you bright enough to understand that the only way out is to cut a deal ? What have I said or done to make you think I would cut a deal ? Oh ... you 're pitching a deal 'cause you 're worried . You sent little Jake in my place , didn 't you ? That 's a bad poker face , Agent Duarte . Qui tacet consentire videtur . " He who is silent is understood to agree . " You know , it 's because of people like you that I love the Patriot Act . I hope you kissed him good-bye . Because even if he manages to fool them , which he won 't for too long , the temptation will be too much for the little bag-biter to resist . I know it was for me . Yeah , right . Oh , and Dumont - besame el culo . This place used to be headquarters for east berlin communist youth . Now you can 't get a drink here for less than 20 euros . Wow . Ausgezeichnet . Excellent . Carry on . Enschuldigen sie bitte . Uh , is this the end of the line ? Dude , what are you doing ? Right . Come on . We don 't do lines . Look who we brought . Aha ! Family 's complete . Hey , about time . How you doing , brother ? How was your flight , man - Good . - Good . Finally , in the flesh . Dumont ? Yori . You 're not what I expected . - What 'd you expect ? - Less . - Come on ! - Come on ! Come on , man ! Bring it on ! Come on , man ! Another round . You got the shots ? Put on some liederhosen ! Bring your sister . Bring your sister . Temping was the worst . Anything goes wrong , they blame you . Dranzacom fired me because they thought I was stealing post-its . Well , that and I wouldn 't sleep with the homunculus office manager . Nothing 's as bad as a render farm - herding pixels 24 hours a day for nothing . I couldn 't even afford a new futon . I slept on a used one . Hey , at least you had a bed . Try sleeping on a flea-infested couch while your less talented , more politically savvy friends are peddling IPOs . Oh ! Yeah , okay , okay . Uh , m-my first I.T. job , I-I had these two bosses that second-guessed everything that I did . And they give me a " promotion " and take away my overtime . I 'm driving this old , rusty piece of junk car , I live above a 24-hour deli . To this day , the smell of fried peppers makes me homicidal . That surprises me , Dumont . I can 't imagine you as an I.T. Yeah , I 'm trying to forget it . Hey , here 's to not spending 80 hours a week putting away code in a cubicle , never wearing a tie and never being poor . And to doing it on our own terms , ladies and gentlemen ! Oh , yeah ! Ow ! That 's right ! Cheers . Oh-oh , yeah ! Oh ! This yours ? Vid phone . Real-time data stream . Cool ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Woo ! Hi . Yeah ! What the hell is he doing ? I think it 's the slip . It 's this dance ... more like a grind , actually . It 's very popular in the mitte district . Not helping . Right . These are the players ? We assume . He didn 't bother to label the photos or contact us three hours ago like he was supposed to . Let 's see if we can photo-match ID any of these guys . Working on it . Why is Jake in all of his photos ? I have no idea . How much lead time does German Intelligence need to mount a raid ? - Thirty minutes . - Well , we can wait for Jake to figure out what they 're planning , or we can go in there now and nail them for the Federal reserve . Alert the Germans . We 're getting him out of there . Dude , your phone . Thanks ! What ? You 're beautiful . This is it . He 's at the bar . - He 's here . - Yeah . You want me to do it or are you gonna ? Uh , well , you know , whatever . - Okay , so you give him the 30 . - Got it . The-the 30,000 . Is that all ? That 's what we talked about , right ? He 's not going to jack you , is he ? - Better not . - All right , here we go . - It 's all there ? - Yeah , it 's all there . Don 't try to jack us . What ? Don 't you have something for me ? He took off from Heathrow six minutes ago . He took off from Heathrow six minutes ago . We 're going to change the world , bro . Yeah , that we are . Hey , guys ! Guys , we 're on . Dumont just got the word . - Awesome ! - It 's on ? Now ? Hey , listen , I just ... I really have to ... I 'm going to go . I 'll be just a minute . Hey , what 's going on ? - Why haven 't I heard from you ? - All right , just listen . He left Heathrow airport six minutes ago . Uh , well , no . Eight , I guess . What are you talking about ? Uh , I don 't know . I don 't know . Uh . It 's a plane . I think that there 's something big this time . No , Jake , listen . We 're getting you out . German Intelligence is moving in ten minutes . No , no , no , they can 't . This thing 's already in motion . Who are you ? I don 't know what game you 're playing , Dumont , but I 'm not interested . What , what game ? We 've been doing it online for six months , okay ? I don 't need you to tell me I 'm beautiful . Save the compliments for somebody who needs it . Wait , wait . We 're not online anymore . You 're breaking all the rules . No eye contact , no real names . We 're breaking the rules . Guys ... we got work to do . What 's the target ? Get in . Come on . Give us a hint . Guess we 're going down . We 're going way down . What 's that beeping ? I-I 'm sorry . It 's Jake . What just happened ? All his numbers just disappeared . What does that mean , he 's dead ? I don 't know . He 's just gone . German Intelligence just raided the club . There 's no sign of the hackers . No sign of Jake . How is that possible ? They went out of satellite range . I don 't ... maybe they went underground . Have them send us a subterranean grid of all sewers and tunnels in the vicinity . Get me manifests of all flights coming into Berlin . Priority match anything that came out of Heathrow in the last half hour . Cool ... we are in the bat cave . No , dude . We 're in Hitler and Eva Braun 's love bunker . We 're inside a concealed lead-lined , nuclear fallout shelter that hasn 't seen the light of day since the Berlin wall came down . This is really cool . You think we can get back to the club and keep drinking ? What are we doing ? There must be 100 asbestos-free , nicely-ventilated places we could do this . There is no place as safe from satellite surveillance , thermal imaging , and sonar and radio interference . So buckle your seat belts , ladies and gentlemen . Excuse me . Boys and girls , may I present three tons of supercomputing magnificence . A teraflop machine . A multi-teraflop machine . What is that - like , 60 billion calculations per second ? - Look at the size of that thing . - I am in love . Our target is Banatech . My old stomping ground . Nice . I 've been wanting to get back at those wipes ever since they started charging for their stupid upgrades . - Buggy software . - I temped there for a couple of weeks trying to lift the code off the beta version of their new browser . - How 'd you make out ? - I didn 't . They 've got the firewall of death . I don 't care how many teraflops we 've got here . You 're right . It 's impossible to crack their firewall . But not their executive jet . Right now , all of Banatech 's top management are on it , flying in from Heathrow to a conference in Berlin . When that jet enters German airspace , we are going to crack its fly-by wire , forcing it to circle and circle ... Losing fuel until their top brass transfer their fortunes into our Cayman accounts . We 're talking " b " as in billions ! Catch me . I 'm gonna faint . Good . So , guys ... uh , we don 't have a lot of time . Please , start your software . Be careful . Dumont , can I have a word ? Where are my manifests ? We 've got 22 printing now . The Germans just sent us the underground grids . It 's a mess : Miles and miles of cold war bunkers and tunnels . Tell ' em to start looking . Here they are . I got to say , man , I doubted you . You were right , man . They bought everything . They bought everything like a bag of chips . You got everything else locked down ? What else is there ? Cayman accounts ? You said we didn 't need them . And by the time this is done , it 's going to be pretty obvious we didn 't do this for the money . We got all the money we need . In your own words , " the only thing we don 't have is infamy . " You want to do the toast ? To crashing a plane . To crashing a plane full of toads . It 's all you , Dumont . You are a genius . We 're in the system . We 're ready to take that plane when you are . Nice ! Agent Duarte , Dumont says he knows about the hackers ' plans , but he 'll only talk to you . Let 's go . You come in . What I have to say is for your ears only . Open it . You seem pretty tense . How 's it going ? Do you have something to tell me or not ? Just this . Tell me about the plane ! He asks for me again , you tase him . Right . Open it . - Say the magic word . - Give it to me ! Give it to me ! Say it now ! He slipped . Got the navigational beacon . Dumont , crack the fly-by wire whenever you 're ready . Just a sec . - We 've got a problem . - Yes , we do . Upper management of Banatech is flying into Berlin as we speak . The company Dumont hates . What is that ? Someone 's trying to send us a message through one of our secure uplinks . I think it 's coming from Berlin . It 's Jake . Get Berlin air traffic control . Find that plane and land them , now ! Dumont , what are you doing ? Waiting for the ping to come back from the 5-0-1 . We got that five minutes ago . Look , it 's right there . Now , take the damn plane . No . Why not ? What 's-what 's going on ? Who 's trying to upload a message ? Check your e-mail at home , guys . This is Berlin control requesting an immediate emergency landing Tower , this is charter November X-Ray seven-four-two-zero-five . This communication is highly irregular . I need a reason to initiate an emergency landing . Fly-by-wire 's been bypassed . Manual override 's out . We don 't have control of the plane . How do we get control of that plane ? Get a secure line to Berlin Intelligence . German air traffic control should have a code to override the fly-by-wire and release that plane . They 're gonna crash ... in ten minutes . Dude , how could you ? Because you 're all being used . You weren 't brought here to hold that plane hostage . You were brought to crash it . - What ? - He 's lying . Yeah , tell them about the Cayman accounts . There aren 't any ! This isn 't about money . This is all about Dumont getting back at Banatech . Who you gonna believe ? Your friend who 's made you millions or this U.S. government wage slave ? Look , I 've met Dumont . You know he can make you believe anything that he wants . He 's got you isolated . His lackey 's got a gun . You really believe he meant for you to get out of this alive ? Okay , let 's rethink this . It 's not worth it till we know who 's telling the truth . Do you all feel that way ? Okay , then . No , no ! I feel differently . Ich bin Louise Beckett . Ich muss mit ihren direktor sprechen . You 're pretty good , huh - as a hacker and a social engineer . Buy you 'll never be a player . You better pray . Mayday , mayday , mayday . This is November X-Ray Seven-Four-Two-Zero-Five . We are unable to maintain control of the equipment . Ja , ich verstehe . The hackers have locked the Germans out of their own system . They can 't input the override code . But Jake can . Wir benotigen seinen code . Wir benotigen seinen code . It 's gonna be okay . Not for you , it 's not . What did you do to my computer ? We got it back . We have control of the plane . Pull up . Just pull up ! This is November X-Ray Seven-Four-Two-Zero-Five requesting immediate landing clearance , please . He did it . Anything more you can tell us , Agent Foley ? Yeah , I don 't know . Uh ... excuse me . I 'm sorry about the way things turned out . You 've got nothing to be sorry for . Uh , my real name is Rachel . Jake . What ? Nothing . It 's just funny , you know . I just rode to work with the world 's first ride-sharing superspy . Yeah , well , I hear ride-sharing 's an idea whose time has come . - Oh , yeah ? - Yeah . - Huh . I 'll see ya . - Okay . How was Berlin , Jake ? Miss me ?

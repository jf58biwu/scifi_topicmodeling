 [ Man ] They say most of your brain shuts down in cryo-sleep . All but the primitive side- - the animal side . No wonder I 'm still awake . Transporting me with civilians . Sounded like 40 , 40-plus . Heard an Arab voice . Some hoodoo holy man . Probably on his way to New Mecca . But what route ? What route ? Smelled a woman . Sweat , boots , tool belt , leather . Prospector type . Free settlers . And they only take the back roads . And here 's my real problem : Mr.Johns , blue-eyed devil . Plannin 'on taking me back to slam , only this time he picked a ghost lane . A long time between stops . A long time for something to go wrong . [ Piercing Sounds ] [ Computer Beeping ] [ Grunts ] [ Breathing Heavily ] - [ Piercing Sounds ] - [ Grunting ] [ Beeping ] [ Panting ] [ Grunts ] [ Coughing ] Why did I fall on you ? He 's dead . Captain 's dead . I was looking right at him . The chrono shows we are 22 weeks out , so gravity ... was not supposed to kick in for another 1 9 . Why 'd I fall at all ? Did you hear what I said ? Captain 's dead . 1550 millibars . Dropping 20 m.b. per minute . Shit ! We 're hemorrhaging air . Something took a swipe at us . Come on . Just tell me we 're still in the shipping lane . just show me all those stars . Come on ! Those big , bright- - [ Computer Beeping ] What ? This is an emergency dispatch from merchant vessel Hunter Gratzner ... en route to the Tangiers system with 40 commercial passengers on board . We have been knocked out of our shipping lane and are currently entering ... the atmosphere of a planetary body in the following position- - X-38-stroke-five , Y-95-stroke-eight , Z-2 1- - Fry , where the hell 's our Comms ? - [ Grunts ] - [ Gasps ] [ Male Computerized Voice ] Rate of descent beyond known limits . Rate of descent- - Hey , they trained you for this , Fry , right ? [ Female Computerized Voice ] Deploy lower air brakes now . - Deploy lower air brakes now . - [ Male Voice ] Center of gravity too far aft . Recommend purging ballast now . Recommend- - What the f- - Was that a purge , Fry ? Too heavy in the ass ! Can 't get my fucking nose down ! [ Man ] Crisis program selected number two in this system ... because it shows at least some oxygen . Maximum terrain 220 meters over lean surface , largely cinder and gypsum with some evaporate deposits . [ Hull Clanging ] Fry , what the hell are you doing ? I gotta drop more load . Look , I tried everything else . I still got no horizon . You better try everything twice , 'cause no way do we just flush out- - Look , if you know something I don 't , get your ass up here and take the chair , Owens ! Listen , Company says we are responsible for every single one of those people , Fry . What , we both die out of sheer fucking nobility ? Don 't you touch that handle , Fry ! [ Beeping ] [ Grunting ] I 'm not gonna die for them ! - [ Male Voice ] Air lock doors not secure . - Owens ! Seventy seconds , Fry . You still have 70 seconds to level this beast out . - [ Computerized Voices Overlapping ] - Shit ! Shit ! Shit ! Air lock doors not secure . What the fuck is happening up there ? [ People Speaking In Arabic ] [ Passengers Coughing ] - [ Woman ] Imam ? - [ Man ] Imam ? Zeke ? [ Choking ] [ Grunting ] [ Blade Clicking ] Somebody 's gonna get hurt one of these days . It ain 't gonna be me . [ Grunts ] [ Grunts ] Here , Shazza . So , I guess something went wrong . Ohh . I 'm sorry . Get it outta me ! [ Panting ] Don 't touch it ! Don 't- - Don 't you touch that handle ! - Leave it alone ! - Get it out of him ! - No , no , no . It 's too close to his heart . - [ Panting ] There 's some Anestaphine in the med-lock in the back of the cabin . - [ Owens Groaning ] - Not anymore there 's not . Get outta here . Everyone . [ Labored Breathing ] Get outta here ! ? [ Singing In Arabic ] That 'll teach me for flying coach . Interesting . [ Man ] Is anyone else having difficulties breathing ? [ Shazza ] Yeah . I feel one lung short . All of us . [ Boy ] I feel like I just ran or something . There was talk of a scouting party looking for other people , but then we saw this . What the bloody hell happened ? Could have been a meteor storm . Might have been a real comet . - I don 't know . - Well , I for one am thoroughly grateful . This beast wasn 't made to land like this , but I think You did well . Actually , the only reason we 're alive is because of her . Yes , I suppose you 're right . Thanks very much . [ Boy ] Yeah . Thanks for saving our dicks . [ Man ] No , really . Thanks awfully . Well done . He just escaped from a maximum prison . So do we just keep him locked up forever ? Well , that would be my choice . [ Whispering ] Is he really that dangerous ? Only around humans . [ Man ] The whole bloody container 's upside down . It 's all topsy-turvy . [ Sighs ] Well . Thank goodness it 's not a total loss . Booze ? This is what You have to drink ? I 'm gonna need a receipt for that . For all of these . This is my personal stuff . I don 't suppose this will help you at all . Unfortunately , it is not permitted , especially while on hajj . - You do realize there 's no water , don 't you ? - All deserts have water . - It only waits to be found . - I hope you 're right . All the more for me , then . [ Grunting ] [ Grunting ] Motherfucker . [ Grunts ] [ Fry ] And what the hell are these ? They 're Maratha crow-bill war picks from Northern India . Very rare . And this ? That 's a hunting blow dart pipe from Papua New Guinea . That 's very , very rare , since the tribe is now extinct . 'Cause they couldn 't hunt shit with these things would be my guess . Well , what 's the point anyway ? If the man is gone , he 's gone . Why should he bother us ? Maybe to take what you got . Maybe to work your nerves . Or maybe to just come back and skull-fuck you in your sleep . Sounds like a charmer . For you . Let 's just get it- - Yeah . Yeah ? Yeah . Imam ! If we 're looking for water , we should leave soon- - before nightfall , while it 's cooler . Ali . Excuse me . I think you should see this . Three suns ? - Bloody hell . - So much for your nightfall . So much for my cocktail hour . We take this as a good sign . A path . Direction from Allah . Blue sun , blue water . You ever wondered why I 'm an atheist ? It 's a bit of a bad sign . That 's Riddick 's direction . I thought you found his restraints over there . Towards sunset . Right . Which means he went towards sunrise . Zeke . Fully-loaded clip . Safety 's on . One shot if you spot him , okay ? Don 't tell me you 're going off , too . Yeah . What happens if Mr. Riddick spots us first ? [ Chuckles ] There 'll be no shots . Quiet ! Sh-Sh-Sh-Sh . [ Crackling Sound ] Seven stones to keep the devil at bay . - You 're on a trip to New Mecca , right ? - Once in every lifetime ... should there be a great hajj , a great pilgrimage . To get to know Allah better ? Yes . But to know yourself as well . - Yeah . - We are all on the same march now . [ Footsteps ] - [ Gasps ] - Sorry . So , did you see anything ? No Riddick . Trees . And trees mean water . - You comfy up there ? - It 's amazing how you can do without necessities ... provided you have the little luxuries . Well , just keep Your bloody eyes open . I don 't want that dog sneaking up on my bloody ass . Yes , well- - You dig the graves ; I 'll hold the fort , old boy . - [ Grunts ] Christ ! - He 'd probably get you right here , right under the jaw , and you 'd never even hear him coming , 'cause that 's how good Riddick is . Tell me something . Did you run away from your parents , or did they run away from you ? [ Speaking In Arabic ] [ Imam ] It 's a communal graveyard , perhaps . Like the elephants of Earth . [ Man Speaking In Arabic ] He asks what could have killed so many great things . Is this whole planet dead ? [ Device Pumping ] Drink ? Probably shouldn 't do this . Dehydrates you even more . - You 're probably right . - [ Grunts ] You could have stayed back at the ship . You probably should have . - If we don 't find water , you know what happens . - I wanted to get away . I 've never seen a captain so ready to leave her ship . I think we should keep moving . What 'd Owens mean ... about not touching the handle ? This is between you and me , Carolyn , I promise . I 'm not your captain . During the landing , when things were at their worst , Owens was at his best . He 's the one that stopped the docking pilot from dumping the main cabin . - Passengers . - And the docking pilot being ? I guess I 'm a little more glad to be here than I thought . [ Sniffing ] [ Cocks Weapon ] Hassan ! Suleiman ! [ Speaking In Arabic ] Captain ! [ Speaking In Arabic ] [ Whirring ] [ Man ] As salaam alaikum ! As salaam alaikum ! As salaam alaikum ! [ Fry ] Is there anyone here ? There was water here . Lights ? Lights on ? Okay . [ Windows Creaking ] [ Speaking In Arabic ] - Allahu Akbar . Allahu Akbar . - They are saying God is great . Allahu Akbar . Yes . This is the source of the water . No darkness . No lights because no darkness . [ Fry ] Whoo ! Hello , Mecca ! [ Machinery Clanging ] Tell me that was you just now . What are you going on about ? He 's been right here helping me . Back of the ship . That noise . You trying to tell me that was someone ... else ? [ Machinery Clanging ] [ No Audio ] - No ! - [ Gasps ] Oh , my God . I thought I was the only one who got out of the crash alive . [ Gunshots ] - Christ ! - [ Shazza Gasping ] It was just somebody else . It was just somebody else from the crash ! [ Panting ] Crikey . I thought it was him . I thought it was Riddick . No juice . It looks like it 's been laid up for years . But we might be able to adapt it to the- - Shut up . Sorry . I thought I heard something . Like what ? Gunshots . [ Grunts ] - [ Animal Growling ] - [ Gunshots ] [ Gunshots Continue ] - [ Gunshots ] - [ Screams ] - [ Screams ] - [ Gunshots Continue ] Zeke ! Piece of shit ! What did you do to Zeke ? What did you do to him ? [ Fry ] Shazza ! Just kill him . Just somebody goddamn kill him before he- - So where 's the body ? Well , do you want to tell me about the sounds ? Look , you told Johns You heard something . That 's fine . You don 't want to talk to me , that 's your choice , but just so you know , there 's a debate right now as to whether we should just leave you here to die . You mean the whispers ? - What whispers ? - The ones telling me to go for the sweet spot ... just to the left of the spine , fourth lumbar down . The abdominal aorta . It 's a metallic taste , human blood . Copperish . If you cut it with peppermint schnapps , that goes away quickly- - Do you want to shock me with the truth now ? All you people are so scared of me . Most days , I take that as a compliment . But it ain 't me You got to worry about now . Show me your eyes , Riddick . You 'd have to come a lot closer for that . Closer . Where the hell can I get eyes like that ? - Gotta kill a few people . - Okay . I can do it . Then you gotta get sent to a slam ... where they tell you You 'll never see daylight again . You dig up a doctor , and you pay him 20 menthol Kools ... to do a surgical shine job on your eyeballs . So you can see who 's sneaking up on you in the dark ? - Exactly . - Leave ! Leave . Cute kid . Did I kill a few people ? Sure . Did I kill Zeke ? No . You got the wrong killer . He 's not in the hole . We looked . Look deeper . Let me tell you what I think happened . I think he went off on the guy and buried him in the hill somewhere , and now he 's got you believing there 's something else out there . - Well , let 's just be sure . - Murders aside , Riddick belongs in the asshole hall of fame . He loves to jaw-jack and he loves to make you feel afraid because that 's all he has , and you 're playing right into it . I don 't know why I 'm trying to explain this to you . You 're a cop . For God 's sake , we couldn 't find his body . - Hey , I 'll go . - No one is going . - Stay here . Being ballsy with your life doesn 't change what came before . It 's just stupid . What ? Do you think I 'm trying to prove something ? Well , are you ? They 're hollow . [ Raptor Screeching ] [ Panting ] [ Raptors Screeching ] [ Grunting ] [ Raptors Screeching ] [ Screaming ] I 'm in here ! I 'm in here ! I 'm inside ! I thought I heard something . Please ! Can you hear me ? [ Raptors Growling ] [ Fry Shouting In Distance ] [ Raptors Whooping ] [ No Audio ] [ Raptors Whooping ] [ Screams ] Give me your goddamn hand . I heard you , Fry . I heard you first . - Come on . - Fry , are you okay ? - What 's down there ? What is it ? - Did you find Zeke ? - You 're all right . - Fry , are you okay ? [ Johns ] Okay . Fuck ! That was so fucking stupid ! I don 't know what the fuck is in there , but whatever it is , it got Zeke , and it nearly got me- - Aah ! Get it off me ! Get it off me ! - Get it off me ! Get it off me ! - Watch it ! Watch your head ! Finally found something worse than me , huh ? So here 's the deal . You work without chains , without the bit and without shivs . - You do what I say when I say it . - For what ? The honor of going back to some asshole of a cell ? Fuck you . The truth is- - is I 'm tired of chasing you . Are you saying You 'd cut me loose ? I 'm thinking you could have died in the crash . My recommendation- - do me . Don 't take the chance that I 'll get shiv-happy on your wanna-be ass . - Okay . - Ghost me , motherfucker . That 's what I would do to you . I want you to remember this moment . The way it could have gone and didn 't . Here . Take it easy . Fuck you ! Do we have a deal ? [ Sighs ] I want you to remember this moment . Just one ? For now . So , click your fingers , and he 's one of us now . [ Chuckles ] I didn 't say that . But at least this way , I don 't have to worry about you all ... falling asleep and not waking up . So , can I talk to him now ? No . No . Blast . Paris P. Ogilvie . Antiquities dealer , entrepreneur . Richard B. Riddick . Escaped convict , murderer . [ Pops Cork ] That 's a good Shiraz . It 's a lovely drop . I-It 's very expensive . By all means , please . Help yourself . I mean , normally I can appreciate antiques , but this , this is something else . It 'll work . There 's nothing we can 't repair so long as the electrical adapts . Well , it 's not a star jumper . Doesn 't need to be . Take a two-seater like this back up to the shipping lanes . Stick out a thumb . Bound to get picked up . Ain 't that right , Captain ? Can I have a little help here ? I 've got it . All right . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Do me a favor . Check these containers out and , uh , see what we can patch these wings up with . Huh ? [ Squeaking ] [ Chuckles ] [ Speaking In Arabic ] [ Speaking In Arabic ] All right , all right . My turn . [ Fry ] Okay . We are getting there . So , we 've got enough power for a sys-check , but we 'll still need more cells . How many are we talking about ? Um , let 's see , we got a 90-gig draw . The other ship takes 20-gig cells , so that 'd be five . Five total to launch . Thirty-five kilos each , huh ? Fuck . Well , that 's pretty heavy . Well , you know that old sand cat out there ? Mm-hmm . I might be able to get it going . Yeah . Do it if you can , but if you need a hand- - Where 'd Riddick go ? Let 's go . [ Whistles ] You 're missing the party . Come on , boy . [ Gasps ] Missing the party . Come on . Oh , man . - [ Machinery Whirring ] - [ Speaking In Arabic ] All praises be Allah , for his many blessings to us . - What ? - It 's the winner of the look-alike contest . [ Beeping ] Who were these people , anyway ? Miners ? Looks like geologists . You know , an advance team- - moves around from rock to rock . Nice of them to leave so much stuff here . Why 'd they leave their ship ? [ Fluttering ] It 's not a ship . It 's a skiff , and it 's disposable , really . It 's more like an emergency life raft , right ? Yeah . They probably had a big drop ship take them off planet . These people didn 't leave . Come on . Whoever got Zeke got them . They 're all dead . You don 't really think they left with their clothes on hooks , photos on the shelves . Maybe they had weight limits . You don 't know . I know you don 't prep Your emergency ship unless there 's a fuckin ' emergency . He 's fuckin ' right . Watch your mouth . He 's just saying what we 're all thinking . So what happened ? Where are they ? Has anyone seen the little one ? Ali ? Has anyone checked the coring room ? [ Raptors Screeching ] Aaah ! Ali . [ Raptors Screeching ] [ Screaming ] Aaah ! [ Panting ] [ Fluttering ] [ Panting ] [ Gunshots ] Ali . Slowly . Jack , wait . Wait . [ Imam ] Ali ? Ali ? Ali ? [ Gasps ] Ali ? [ Grunts ] [ Raptors Screeching ] [ Johns ] Imam ? Imam ? [ Gasps ] [ Speaking In Arabic ] Other buildings weren 't secure . So they ran here . Heaviest doors . Thought they 'd be safe inside . But they forgot to lock the cellar . Here . What , it 's broken ? No , there are still a few hits . Actually , you asshole , I 'm trying to say that I 'm sorry . Okay . Let 's board this place up and get the hell outta here . Whatever the fuck those things were , they seem to stick to darkness , So , if we stick to daylight , we should be all right , ok ? Let 's go . 22 years ago . What ? These coring samples are dated . Last one 's 22 years ago this month . I don 't know . There could be . An eclipse You 're not afraid of the dark , are you ? So we gotta get the power cells . I 've still gotta check on the hull and patch the wings . Wait on the power cells . What ? Wait for what ? Until it 's too dark to get back ? We don 't know when it 'll happen . Let 's not get overexcited . Just get the fucking cells here , Johns . What ... What is the discussion ? Maybe I should tell you how Riddick escaped . He can pilot ? He hijacked a prison transport , made a hell of a good run before I tracked his ass down . Ok , ok , maybe that 's a good thing . Maybe we can use him to help us navigate or something . He also figured out how to kill the pilot . Look , you told me we could trust him . You said that we had a deal , Johns . Now , you may have noticed that chains don 't work on this guy . Now the only way you people are truly safe is if he believes he 's going free . Let 's just say he stops believing ... You mean if he realizes that we 're going to royally fuck him over . I want you to listen to me for a second . If we bring the cells up at the last possible minute when the wings are ready and we 're ready to launch ... He hasn 't harmed any of us.He hasn 't even lied to us . | Let 's just stick to the deal John He 's a killer . The law sayshe has to do his bid . There 's nothing I can do about that . You hear me ? You 're dancing on razor blades here . I 'm not gonna give him a chance to grab another ship or slash another pilot 's throat . Not on my watch . Bad sign - I thought I said no shivs . - Shivs ? This ? This is just a personal grooming appliance . Thanking you . Looks like we 're a few shy . Power cells . They 're coming . It 's strange , not doing a run-up on the main drive yet . Unless Unless he told you the particulars of my escape . I got the quick-and-ugly version . You 're worried about a repeat . It has entered our minds . I asked what you thought . You scare me . That 's what you want to hear , isn 't it ? Now , can I just get back to work ? I 've been meaning to catch up with you alone . Unrestrained . You think Johns is a do-right man ? You think I could trust him to cut me loose ? Why ? What did you hear ? I guess if it were " trickeration , " he 'd just " X " me out . He 'd kill me . Then again I am worth twice as much alive . You didn 't know that ? Your Johns ain 't a cop . He 's got that nickel-slick badge . And that blue uniform . But he 's just a merc . And I 'm just a payday . That 's why he won 't kill me , see ? - The creed is greed . - Don 't waste my time . We 're not gonna turn on each other , no matter how hard you try . I don 't truly know what 's gonna happen when the lights go out . But I do know once the dying starts this little psycho-fuck family of ours is gonna rip itself apart . Ever wonder why Johns shakes like that ? Ask him . Ask why your crew pal had to scream so painfully before he died . So who are you really ? You 're not a cop , are you ? I never said I was . No , you didn 't . You never said you were a hype , either . You have a little caffeine in the morning and I have a little morphine . So what ? Here you got two mornings every day . Wow , were you born lucky . - It 's not a problem unless you 're gonna ... - No , it becomes a problem when you let Owens die like that ! You have enough drugs here to knock out a mule team . Owens was already dead . His brain just hadn 't caught on to the fact . Is there anything else I should know about you , Johns ? You know , I. I 'm letting you roll the dice on our lives . It is not unreasonable ... Do you feel that ? That 's my first run-in with Riddick . He went for the sweet spot and missed . They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there , Carolyn , and I can feel it pressing against the cord . So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve endings is my business . It 's just that you could 've done something , and you didn 't . - Yeah , look to thine own ass first , right ? - Captain ! Captain ! I 'm not your fucking captain . What do my eyes see ? If we need anything from the crash ship , I suggest we kick on . That sand cat 's solar . - Where 's Riddick ? - Leave him ! He wouldn 't wait for us ! I thought we 'd lost you . Johns ! Where are you going ? I 'm gonna get some things . I 'll be a few minutes . You wouldn 't leave without me , would you ? How many are there ? Beautiful . Allah ! People , just a suggestion . Perhaps you should flee ! - Let 's go ! - Come on ! Run ! Shit ! Come on ! Get in . Get down ! No . No ! Stay there ! - Stay down , Shazza ! Just stay down ! - Come back here ! Shazza , stay down ! Please , I really think we should go inside . We have to be inside to be able to close the door . Let 's go ! What is it ? What is it now ? Like I said it ain 't me you gotta worry about . She should 've stayed down . If she only would 've stayed down , she 'd be okay . She wouldn 't have died . You remember the boneyard ? These just might be the fuckers that killed every living thing on this planet . What are we gonna do now ? Are these the only lights we have ? Is this everything ? No . There 's a cutting torch on the floor here . I just can 't find it . Quiet please , everyone . Why do they do that ? Make that sound ? Perhaps it 's the way they see . With sound reflecting back . Could be a breach in the hull . I don 't know . Come on , Johns . You got the big gauge . I 'd rather piss glass . Why don 't you go fuckin ' check ? - I 'm not staying here one more second . - Where are you going ? Sit him down . - You don 't know what 's out there . - I know what 's in here . Hurry ! Now we 're trapped in a much smaller space . I hate this ! Extremely bad timing . Just don 't run . Reddick Don 't stop burning . - Take this . - Take that . Hassan ? Where is Hassan ? Is it alive ? - It 's like the light is scalding it . - It hurts them . Light actually hurts them . Is that Hassan ? We 'll burn a candle for him later . Come on . Let 's get out of here . So we 've got one cutting torch . We 've got two hand lights . There 's gotta be something we can rip out of the crash ship . Spirits . Anything over 45 proof burns rather well . - How many bottles you got ? - I don 't know . Maybe 10 . Johns , you 've got some flares . - Maybe we got enough light . - Enough for fuckin ' what ? We stick to the plan . We get the four cells back to the skiff . We 're off this rock . I hate to ruin a beautiful theory with an ugly fact but that sand cat is solar . - It won 't run at night . - So we carry the cells . We drag them . Whatever it takes . You mean tonight ? With all those things still out there ? All right . Now how long can this last ? A few hours ? A day , tops ? I had the impression from the model the two planets were moving as one and there would be a lasting darkness . These suns gotta come up sometime . If these creatures are phobic about light , then we just sit tight and let the sun come up . I 'm sure somebody else said that locked inside that coring room . We need to think about everybody , especially the kid . - He 'll be scared out there in the dark . - Don 't use him like that . - Like what ? - As a smoke screen . Deal with your fear . Why don 't you shut your fucking mouth for two seconds and let me come up with a plan that doesn 't involve mass suicide ? I 'm waiting . How much do you weigh Johns ? - What 's it matter ? - How much ? Around 79 kilos , to be exact ... You 're 79 kilos of gutless meat . That 's why you can 't think of a plan . Is that fuckin ' right ? Where are you goin ' ? This solves nothing . They 're afraid of our light . That means we don 't have to be afraid of them . And you are sure you can get us there ? Even in the dark ? No , I can 't . But he can . Stay close . Wait . Reddick ! Looks clear . - You said , " Clear . " - I said , " It looks clear . " What 's it look like now ? Looks clear . I 'll be runnin ' 10 paces ahead . I want light on my back but not in my eyes . And check your cuts . These bad boys know our blood now . Are we actually going to do this ? We stay together . We keep the light burning . That 's all we gotta do to live through this thing . Are you ready Johns ? Yeah Look , we 're just wasting light here . You give him the cells and the ship and he 'll leave you all out there to die . He 'll leave all of you . I don 't get it Johns . What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you 're worried about losing ? Is there anything at all ? Besides your next spike ? Stay close . Wait . Jack This can 't be happening . This can 't be happening Paris , Get back here ! Are you all right ? I was supposed to die in France . I never ever saw France . Well , it 's good to see you 're okay . Do I even want to know ? Are we gettin ' close ? Can we pick up the pace ? You want to tell me what 's the hells goin ' on ? - We crossed our own tracks . - Why have we circled ? - Are we lost ? - Listen . - Do you even know where we are ? - Listen ! Canyon ahead . I circled once to buy some time to think . - I think we should go now . - I don 't know about that . That 's death row up there . - Especially with the girl bleeding . - What ? What are you talkin ' about ? She 's not cut . Not her . Her . You gotta be kidding me . I thought it 'd be better if people took me for a guy . I thought they might leave me alone instead of always messing with me . You could 've left me at the ship . That 's why I didn 't say something sooner . They 've been nose-open for her ever since we left . In case you haven 't noticed , they go off blood . Look . This is not gonna work . We 're gonna have to go back . What did you say ? You 're the one who got us out here in the first place and turned us into sled dogs . - I was wrong . I admit it , okay - Can we just get back to the ship ? - I don 't know if we can Nice breeze . Wide-open space . I 'm startin ' to enjoy my fucking self out here . Are you high again ? Just listen to yourself . No , you 're right . What 's to be afraid of ? My life 's just a steaming pile of meaningless shit anyhow . So I say , " Mush on . " The canyon 's only 200 meters and after that it 's skiff city . Why don 't you butch up , stuff a cork in this fuckin ' kid and let 's go . - She 's the captain . Listen to her . - Listen to her ? - When she was willing to sacrifice us ? - What ? This does not help us . The crash . She tried to blow the passenger cabin , kill us in our sleep . - Shut your mouth ! - We are fucking disposable . - We 're just walkin ' ghosts to you ? - Shut your fucking blowhole ! Fine ! Fine ! You 've made your point . We can all be scared . Oh Caroline How much do you weigh now ? The verdict 's in . The light moves forward . - Ain 't all of us gonna make it . - Just realize that ? Six of us left . If we could make it through the canyon and lose one , that 'd be a feat huh - Not if I 'm the one . - What if you 're one of five ? I 'm listening . - What are they doin ' up there ? - They 're talking about the canyon , I suppose How to get us through . Battlefield doctors decide who lives and dies . It 's called triage . Kept calling it murder when I did it . Either way , I figure it 's something you can grab onto . Sacrifice play . Hack up a body , leave it at the start of the canyon like a bucket of bait . Trawl with it . You got extra cable on the sled . - We drag the body 40 , 50 feet behind us . - Nice embellishment . I don 't want to feed them . I just want to keep them off our scent . - So which one caught your eye ? - Don 't look . What the hell 's wrong with you ? Imam , slow down . Just a little more space between us and them . All right . Enough of this shit . You do the girl and I 'll keep the others off your back . It 's not too big a job for you , is it ? I 'm just wondering if we don 't need a bigger piece of bait . Like who ? Leave the sled ! Let 's move ! Let 's go ! One rule . Stay in the light . Remember that moment ? Should 've never taken the chains off Johns You were one brave fuck before . You were really bad-ass . The chains . The gauge . The badge . I told you to ghost me . Back to the ship , huh ? - Huddle together until the lights burn out ? - Get away from us . Till you can 't see what 's eating you . That the big plan ? - Where 's Johns ? - Which half ? We 're gonna lose everybody out here . - We should 've stayed at the ship . - He died fast . And if we have any choice about it , that 's the way we should all go out . Don 't you cry for Johns . Don 't you dare . Blind spot . Shall we pray together ? I have already prayed with the others . It is painless It 's pointless Because you do not believe in God does not mean God does not believe in ... Think someone can spend half their life in the slam with a horse bit in their mouth and not believe ?

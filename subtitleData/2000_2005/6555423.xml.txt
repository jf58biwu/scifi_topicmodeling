 NARRATOR : This is a story of the past ... and the future . We will come to the future , but first , the past . NARRATOR : Here we have the Earl of Warwick . We can see by his petulantly arched brow ... that he is not en route to a good deed . ( WITCH CHANTING ) WITCH : Mmm . Obey ! Enchanted ... Do you wish to live , old witch ? You have committed grave crimes against God and your king , have you not ? - Have mercy , my lord . - Silence . The Frenchman Count Thibault of Malfete ... shall wed Lady Rosalind , the daughter of our king . I desire that woman . ( GROWLS ) Hmm . I alone am fit to take her hand . WITCH : And her castle , lands , the riches that are her dowry . Thou art not as stupid as thou art hideous , old hag . ( CACKLING ) Tomorrow night ... the king shall feast the arrival of the count . I want the count dead before the feast is over . EARL : A small fortune in gold ... awaits the sorceress who doth my bidding . Not so fast . How shall I know thy magic is sufficient to the task ? WITCH : Does thou find proof enough in this ? ( BUBBLING ) ( CACKLING ) ( COOING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GROWLS ) ( SHRIEKS ) ( ROARS ) ( SNARLING ) EARL : Aah ! That will do ! Take it , witch ! Was that proof enough , my lord ? Come to the king 's castle tomorrow night ... and carry out my plan . If you fail ... you will be burned . Ohh ! ( WITCH CACKLES ) NARRATOR : Our hero , of course , knew none of this . He was safely in his entourage ... traveling , he thought , to his wedding . Here he is ... the Count of Malfete . He is also a duke , a baron , and a lord . A nobleman , plagued by only those small things ... which inconvenience a knight ... the permanent presence of his sisters ... his mother and father ... and , as all knights must endure ... an idiot servant , Andre ... whose smell made people faint ... a considerable achievement ... among a population who never bathed . FATHER : Down , peasant ! ( MAN LAUGHING ) NARRATOR : The duke , or Thibault ... as his subjects were not allowed to call him ... was joyous . The long-awaited day of his marriage had come at last . WOMAN : What have we got here ? Another lot of bloody royal bastards ? MAN : Must be that French duke come to marry the king 's daughter . Mind the forest ! There be dragons who 'll make dinner from your bones in there ! ( LAUGHING ) NARRATOR : Andre loved and protected his master . Master ! Master ! The forest ... it is haunted ! NARRATOR : Thibault responded . ANDRE : Thank you , master . ( THUNDER ) NARRATOR : With every step ... he came closer to the castle of his beloved . He hoped he would be with her soon ... for rare was the journey in which Thibault ... did not have to stop and rescue someone . ( WOMAN SCREAMING ) NARRATOR : This was no exception ... For like his ancestors ... he lived by an ancient family rule ... ANDRE : A woman in distress ! NARRATOR : The only one he knew . WOMAN : Aah ! Aah ! Beware , sire . NARRATOR : Courage was more than a duty . Courage was his creed . ( YELLING ) Aah ! MOTHER : Andre ! Join your master ! FATHER : I 'm talking to you ! Go , go ! Stupid peasant ! Sire ! Behind you ! Ohh ! NARRATOR : Naturally ... THIBAULT : Courage is our creed ! NARRATOR : He was invincible . NARRATOR : Except he was not invincible ... against witchcraft . For this would be his last victory ... in this millennium . ( BELL CHIMING ) MAN : Afternoon , sir . ROSALIND : I hear a rumor ... thou art marrying tomorrow , my lord . I have heard this rumor . I have also heard ... the bride is the most beautiful in all of England . But it is not true . - It is not ? - No . Am I not the most beautiful bride ... in all of England ? THIBAULT : No . Wait . The most beautiful bride ... in all the world . Wear this for me , Thibault . Wear it against thine heart . Thou shalt always be true . WOMAN : Lady Rosalind . Thou shalt not disgrace thyself ... before the wedding . ROSALIND : I must hide and dress for the banquet . ( DRUMS BEATING ) ( MEDIEVAL MUSIC PLAYING ) ( GUESTS LAUGHING AND CHATTERING ) Ooh ooh ohh ! Sire , your bride looks like a gorgeous sparrow . Silence , you impudent peasant . Show respect to your future mistress . ANDRE : Yes , master . Ah ! Thank you , my lord . ( INDISTINCT ARGUING ) ( DOG GROWLING ) ( CHUCKLING ) ( BELCHES ) Quite so , Your Majesty . When our lady drinks her wine ... her eyes will fill with hellish visions . WITCH : The count will appear as a hideous beast . Then my magic will compel her to kill him . Ha ha ha . ( CLINKING GLASS ) KING : My dear friends and noble guests . Thibault , Count of Malfete and Papincourt ... I hereby declare this castle a wedding present . THIBAULT : Hear ye ! Your Majesty , in every way that I am able ... I will serve my beautiful lady ... and do honor to thy kingdom . ( GUESTS APPLAUD AND CHEER ) Drink of my cup ... and you will know my thoughts . ROSALIND : And thou wilt know mine . ( GURGLING ) Ah ! My lord ? - Ah ! - Thibault ! ROSALIND : My lord ! ( CRAZED LAUGHTER ) ( THIBAULT GROANS ) Ohh ! THIBAULT : Ohh ! Aah ! What is it , Thibault ? ( MAN CHANTING IN LATIN ) FATHER : This is not the kind of behavior ... What is happening to you , my son ? Are you crazy ? Drunk ? Count Thibault , this is no way to behave ... in an English court ! Beasts from Hell ! ( SCREAMING ) ROSALIND : Ohh ! That is my mother ! Thibault , that is my mother ! ( SNAKES RATTLING ) ( ROARS ) Demon ! ( GUESTS SCREAMING ) Oh , no ! THIBAULT : No ! What have I done ? It is not me . It is witchcraft ! THIBAULT : Andre , find me a wizard ! France must pay for this treachery . THIBAULT : Find me a wizard ! ( BELL CHIMING ) ( CHIME ) ( CHIME ) PRIEST : Have pity on a poor condemned man . ANDRE : We are here for the last rites . ( DOOR OPENS ) ANDRE : My lord ! We have to hurry . What wizard is this ? He 's English , my lord . But his magic is very good . Your bloody Earl of Warwick did this to me . Indeed he did . And he 'd have me , too , if he knew that I was here . I beg you , my sire . Let him save you . Can you bring my lady back from the dead ? I can reanimate her corpse ... but I don 't think that my lord ... would like the way she looks ... or smells . ( GROANS ) There is another way . ( CRACKLES ) Time is like a mountain . Riddled with tunnels . I can open one of these tunnels for thee ... and return thee to the moment before the murder . If thy will is strong enough . Don 't you think this priest has had enough time ? Hurry up , Father . GUARD : Unlock this door ! Now ! ( POUNDING ON DOOR ) Drink this potion , my lord ... and thou shalt descend into the Mountain of Time . Ohh ! It smells awful . You should not drink that . What if you become a frog , or goat 's feet ? You are right . Drink first , bastard . THIBAULT : And if you die , I will avenge your death . GUARD : What are you doing in there ? ( GUARD JINGLES KEYS ) ( BANGING ON DOOR ) GUARD : Open this door ! Open this door ! It tastes like the shit of the pork . And he should know . ( BANGING CONTINUES ) Ohh . Per Horus et per Ra ... ( GRUNTING AND GROANING ) WIZARD : Et per Salem ... invictus ... ( GROANS ) ( THUNDER ) Ducere ! ( GASPS AND CHUCKLES ) ( POUNDING ON DOOR ) ( BANGING ON DOOR ) I forgot the grouse eggs . Oh , it 's a disaster . I 've lost them in the corridors of Time . GUARD : Open this door ! Open this door ! BOY : Wow . Cool ! GIRL : This is cool . This is pretty cool , yeah . Look at them ! TEACHER : Shh . See the peasant sleeping on the floor ? In those days , people didn 't think ... that peasants deserved any better than that ... and they were considered the property of their masters . Now , the boss of this peasant is the knight . ( CHILDREN GASPING ) TEACHER : See how beautiful the knight 's clothing is ? Miss Rodett , that one is hot , and it just snorted ! ( CHUCKLES ) Now , Tammy , that 's impossible ... because they 're just mannequins ... and mannequins don 't snort . TAMMY : Well , that one just did . ( INHALES ) No , because they 're not real . They 're just like ... dolls . TEACHER : Ah ! Oh , shit ! What are you doing in my chamber ? ( SCREAMING ) ( DRAWS SWORD ) ( SCREAMING ) Aah ! ANDRE : Your chamber ... has been cleaved in half , my lord . This is not the castle ! THIBAULT : What ? ANDRE : Oh , look at this , my sire ! It is Satanic ! Ohh . ( SCREAMING ) THIBAULT : This is Hell , and we are condemned souls . Come . We shall find the prince of this netherworld ... and beg his mercy . ANDRE : Wait for me , my lord ! Dr. Brady , come quick . GUARD : Two guys with swords and armor ... Miller , you 're always overreacting . BRADY : Now , relax . There 's absolutely no need to ... ( SCREAMING ) MILLER : Police are on their way . ( ELEVATOR DINGS ) Peasant , please . Show me the way out of this prince castle ! Yes ! - Pee-yoo ! - Out this way . - They stink ! - Have a nice day . - Bye . Good luck . - Wait ! ( ANDRE SCREAMING ) Peasant ! Wait ! Stop ! ( ELEVATOR MOTOR RUNNING ) ( YELLING ) ( ELEVATOR DINGS ) ( BONKS CONE ) ( ALARM BLARING ) THIBAULT : What is this ? The Gates of Hell ! ANDRE : Look at its eyes of fire ! ( CAR HONKING ) ANDRE : Dragon ! It 's a red dragon ! THIBAULT : Attack ! What the hell are you doing ? ANDRE : Take that , beast ! ( " MACARENA " BEGINS PLAYING IN SPANISH ) ( CD SKIPS AND STOPS ) ANDRE : We have killed it ! THIBAULT : Ah , yes . It is no longer breathing . God is punishing us for practicing the Black Arts . Let us pray for forgiveness . Heavenly Father , forgive us our sins . ANDRE : We are so , so , so , so , so ... so sorry . ( POLICE RADIO SQUAWKING ) - ( KNOCK ON DOOR ) - Dr. Brady ? Ah , Julia . This is Julia Malfete ... who heads up the Medieval Art department . She donated the famous 12th century castle exhibit . Julia designed the exhibit where we found the two men . That stuff right there is the result of the body search . The big guy had the gold coins ... the sword , the shield , and that ring . The little guy had the salt pork ... the sausage , the dagger ... a molar . And that box ... which he probably stole . Not from us . JULIA : Most thieves take valuable things . They usually don 't bring them . This is a Gothic pixis ... the kind of design they were making in Canterbury ... at the end of the 12th century . It has emeralds and rubies . BRADY : Why did the two men sleep here ? They could 've booked a suite at the Ritz . So , you said that you got these out of their pockets ? OFFICER : That 's right . Except the sausage . - ( FLIES BUZZING ) - Hmm . Mm-hmm . JULIA : This stamp ring is fantastic . My family 's coat of arms . Sergeant , can I meet these thieves ? ANDRE : Master , I 'm hungry . My tummy rumbles like a beast . How can you think of food after such tragedy ? Yes . What I would not give to see once more my precious ... ANDRE : My lord ! Look , she 's alive ! THIBAULT : Rosalind . My fair Rosalind . My bride . My ravishing flower . Mistress ! My mistress ! What are you doing ? THIBAULT : It is a miracle . A miracle . Do I know you ? Do you not recognize me , my lady ? I am the Count of Malfete and Papincourt ... the Duke of Anjou . I am your faithful Thibault . You 're who ? And I am Andre le Pate , valet of the count . Please , forgive me for what I did to you ... my dear Rosalind . My name isn 't Rosalind . It 's Julia . No ! You are my Rosalind . The lock of hair you gave me on our wedding day . I carry it over my heart . Please , my love , see for yourself . You see ? It is the color of wheat on a summer 's day . The color of candlelight . THIBAULT : It is your own . BRADY : Stop this ! - That 's enough ! - Rosalind ! You 'll be safer outside ! THIBAULT : Do not leave me ! Do not be afraid ! - BRADY : You don 't want to see this . - ( YELLING AND FIGHTING ) THIBAULT : Courage is our creed ! Courage is our creed ! ( FIGHTING AND GRUNTING ) Wait , stop ! I know this man ! " Courage is our creed . " JULIA : That 's our family motto . This man is my cousin . It 's in here . You see , I thought he was dead . He disappeared when a storm ... capsized his yacht during the Admiral 's Cup . They never recovered his body ... so , of course , declared him dead . He was a very distant French cousin of mine ... but as the last living Malfete , I inherited his estate . OFFICER : If he 's your cousin , what do you want me to do with him ? ANDRE : Sire ... Why does Lady Rosalind call herself Julia ... and allow us to be beaten and chained ? Peasant ... this is not our time . THIBAULT : The wizard did not send us into the past . He sent us into the next millennium . We are thirty generations removed from Malfete . Julia is not my beloved . She 's my descendant . Descendant ? Amber , it 's Julia . Could you get me Hunter ? It 's important . AMBER : That rabbit of yours is on the phone again . ( PHONE BEEPS ) HUNTER : Hey , bunny . What 's up ? JULIA : Thibault Malfete just showed up at the museum . HUNTER : Thibault Malfete ? That 's impossible . Isn 't he supposed to be ... - I know . - Are you sure it 's him ? He looks exactly like his photos . JULIA : Hunter , he quoted the family motto . Does he know yet that we 're selling his entire estate ? JULIA : Well , it 's hard to say what he knows . He 's a little strange . Hunter , this is terrible . I mean , it 's wonderful that he 's alive ... but it 's terrible that we started to sell the estate . Oh , God , I feel awful . HUNTER : The English courts declared him dead . We 're well within our legal rights . How were we supposed to know he was still alive ? Has he mentioned anything about money ? JULIA : Money ? How can you worry about money at a time like this ? No , I 'm just worrying about you . You don 't handle surprises well . Where is your cousin now ? He and this friend of his are downstairs with security . Why don 't we bring them home with us tonight ? He 's family after all . We want to be hospitable . You 're wonderful . I 'll pick you all up in about five minutes . Love ya . Bye , bunny . Bye , big bear . Oh , my God . Thibault Malfete 's still alive . This is a disaster . Blah , blah , blah . You 're pouting . I hate it when you call her bunny . You , my dear , are so much hotter than a bunny . My God , look at yourself . You 're a tigress . ( SNARLS ) Ha ha ha ha ha . ( AMBER SNARLS ) Aah ! THIBAULT : Lady Julia , there has been a terrible mistake . I 'm so sorry . We thought you were dead . Dead ? No , the wizard was a fool , but not a killer . THIBAULT : He only sent us the wrong way . Excuse me ? We fell into the Mountain of Time . Wow . THIBAULT : I must return to my time to prevent ... a great tragedy to our family . THIBAULT : I ask for your assistance . I 'll do whatever I can . ( SIRENS , HORNS , AND CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT ) Ohh ! ( GRUNTING ) - Awful . - Ohh . ( SIREN BLARING ) ( GASPS ) ( CACOPHONY OF CITY NOISES ) Whoa ! ANDRE : We must not go out ! What ... what are you doing ? What are you doing ? No , we have to wait outside . Hunter can 't park here . We have to wait for him . Oh , my God . Bloody coward . ( GRUNTS ) JULIA : We have to ... Those boys are lost . I must go and retrieve them . Ah ! ( YELLING ) Aah ! This is England ? - No ... - Meat ! This is Chicago . Meat , meat , meat ! This is the United States . ANDRE : Meat ! The last I remember was in Sussex , England ... in my castle chambers . You don 't remember anything since then ? No . Do you think maybe you 've suffered ... some sort of memory loss from the accident ? Yes ! After I drank the potion , I remember nothing . - Onions ? - All of them ! All right . You like to eat hot dogs , huh ? I like to eat every kind of dog . VENDER : Now , what are you doing ? - Aargh ! - Leave the dogs ! JULIA : No , no , no . Stop it ! Please , stop . I 'm sorry , I 'm so very sorry . JULIA : He 's French . Yeah . Very . Hi , honey . The situation 's much worse than I thought . What are you talking about ? Bonjour . Holy shit . JULIA : Hunter , this is Thibault Malfete . Thibault , this is my fiancé , Hunter . HUNTER : Pleased to meet you . - Are you noble ? - No . Sorry . But I can certainly tell that you are . JULIA : And this is Andre , Thibault 's assistant . Hello , big nose . THIBAULT : Run behind the chariot , peasant . Yes , master ! JULIA : He can 't run behind the car . - THIBAULT : He cannot ride . He 's not noble . - JULIA : Yes , but he has to ride in the car . - He 's very fast . - We 're taking the freeway . - You can run 70 miles an hour ? - I have good boots . JULIA : No . You must sit in the car , please . - I am fast . - I 'm sure you are . I 'd love to see you run sometime . - Obey . - Yes , my lord . Do you want some dog ? ( TIRES SQUEAL ) ( THIBAULT AND ANDRE SCREAMING ) ( CARS HONKING ) ( HONKING AND YELLING ) Too fast . Are you OK , Mr. Pate ? THIBAULT : Ohh . Too fast ! Honey , could you slow down just a little bit ? HUNTER : I 'm going 22 miles an hour . Yes , I know . Could you try going 21 ? DRIVER : Hey , what 's the matter with you ? You don 't know how to drive ? HUNTER : Go . ( GIVES RASPBERRY ) What ? It 's gonna be fine . ( VOMITING ) ( DEEP BREATH ) ( SIGHS ) Oh , dear . ( CLEARS THROAT ) ( HORN HONKING ) ( ANDRE AND THIBAULT MOANING ) ( GRUNTING ) HUNTER : Get in and open the door . Let 's go inside . ( DOG BARKS ) Hi , sweetie . Hello , Churchill . Hello . Come here . Give Mom a high-five . All right . That 's my boy . Let 's go . ( CHUCKLES ) ANGELIQUE : Like the hat . ( GROWLS ) WOMAN : Angelique ! I need you now ! Come here , peasant . - Come now ! - OK , I 'm coming . WOMAN : Hurry up . THIBAULT : Ahh . ( BOTH GASP ) THIBAULT : How did you do that ? THIBAULT : Night . ( CHUCKLES ) Day . THIBAULT : Night . Day ! I do not have this invention in my castle . JULIA : You don 't have power ? I have the power to judge and condemn to death ... any villain on my land . Oh . Really ? Hunter will be so jealous . I 'm gonna get you two something to drink . Make Hunter one of his power-dude smoothie things . I 'd offer you one ... but nobody seems to like them but him . ( THIBAULT CHUCKLES ) ( VACUUM HUMMING ) ( CLEARS THROAT ) Andre , could you please stop that ? I 'm just starting to feel like I 'm in a disco . THIBAULT : My dear lady ... you said you would offer me your assistance . JULIA : Oh , yes . Anything . What do you need ? I need to find a wizard . ANDRE : Aah ! Sorry , master . Sorry ! - Sorry ! - Idiot ! Apologize to the lady ! Oops . ANDRE : Sorry , master . I ask for mercy . Forgive him , milady . JULIA : It 's OK . The floor needed to be cleaned anyway . So , you were saying something about what ... should we say a wizard ? I need to go back into the tunnels of Time . Of course . I need to just understand what has happened to you . Now , your yacht went down in a storm ? No . You must listen . I am from the time of Thibault VI ... and I have come to the future . OK . Tunnels of Time . Wizards . Thibault VI . JULIA : Oops ! Are you OK ? Yes , lady . THIBAULT : Lovely flower , I see you do not believe me . It is a pity , but please ... try . ( BLENDER SHUTS OFF ) ANDRE : Oh . Yes . Of course I 'll try . ANDRE : She 's green . I never really did like the taste of this . Oh , my God . What happened ? JULIA : Nothing . I 'm eating this very good meat ... with vegetables in a fine sauce . I will shit easy tomorrow . JULIA : It 's jet lag . All right , I 'm sure you would like to wash your hands and whatever else . Why don 't you come with me ? All right . Here you go . Just gonna take this . Julia ! Can I talk to you for a moment , please ? Don 't be bashful with the soap . What is it , master ? A throne ? THIBAULT : It could be . HUNTER : They 're crazy ! JULIA : They have been through a terrible ordeal . They have amnesia . Amnesia ? They 're wacked ! They 're completely retarded . They 're ... Woo ! You know ? - Clean water . - Ha ha ! ( SNIFFING ) The long towel has a good fragrance . Thibault is my cousin , Hunter . He 's my family . Yeah ? I 'm not so sure . He doesn 't strike me as being particularly noble . ( TOILET SEAT BANGING ) ( BOTH LAUGHING ) Julia , come down here ! It 's an emergency . - Very good fountain . - Yes . Your French relatives are bathing in the toilet . Oh , my God . ( TURNS FAUCET ON ) Toothbrushes . I 'll just leave them right here . JULIA : I 'll be right back . JULIA : I 'm going to take a shower ... then go tackle that kitchen . HUNTER : Hurry . Our dinner reservation 's at 8 : 00 . JULIA : Oh ! Where are we going ? Latour . Isn 't that just a little formal for our guests ? First you tell me your cousin 's nobility then you get mad at me when I suggest ... that just maybe , he 's not . Now you 're upset because I pick the best restaurant in town . You make it impossible for me to do the right thing . No . You 're right . Latour 's gonna be great . Thank you , big bear . - I 'll be in the shower . - All right . ANDRE : Ah . Very good flavor . This is not wine , ignorant peasant . THIBAULT : It is oil for the bath . ( CHUCKLING ) Mmm . Very good perfume . ANDRE : Very creamy . THIBAULT : Bathe , servant . No , my sire . I have taken a bath at Christmas . - Bathe ! - No , no ! I 'm afraid ! I don 't want to catch cold and die ! ( ANDRE SCREAMING ) THIBAULT : Be silent , peasant ! Ahh . Do you have another bottle of this bathing oil for Andre ? HUNTER : Do you realize the bath you just took cost over $ 2,000 ? That 's American dollars . Is that a lot ? HUNTER : Yes , it is . Then I will repay you with one of my swans . HUNTER : Oh , well . That sounds fair . THIBAULT : My family tree . So many descendants . ( SINGING IN FRENCH ) ( TELEPHONE RINGS ) ( RING ) ( RING ) - Hello ? - Mr. Cassidy , please . Yeah . Hold on one second . Hunter ? HUNTER : Yeah , bunny ? Honey , it 's your office . Do you want to take it ? - I 'll take it upstairs . - Oh , OK . AMBER : Hello ? Hello ? ANDRE : Hello . AMBER : Hello ? Hello . Who is this ? I 'm Andre le Pate . I have big balls ... and my ass breathes fire . Wow . That must hurt . - Hello . - Hello ? HUNTER : I told you never to call me here . Well , I forgot . - Hello ! Enter ! - Somebody there with you ? ( BLASTING ) - Aah ! - Jesus ! HUNTER : Hang up the damn phone , or I 'll call the police ! I think he hung up the phone . It was Thibault 's little retarded homuncular assistant . Look , this is dangerous . I 'll call you back after Julia goes to bed , OK ? THIBAULT : Lady Julia . You are more than a rose . You are love 's own flower . Come on . That 's ridiculous . No , I just ... This old thing , I threw it on . I haven 't worn it in a couple of years ... but I guess I should learn how to take a compliment . Thank you . Almost . Thank you . Much better . Kissing cousins . Ooh la la . I don 't think that I 've ever seen anyone ... eat a steak in two bites before . Ah . ANDRE : Thank you , master ! ( CHUCKLING ) ANDRE : Be blessed ! MAN : I can assure you ... ANDRE : Thank you ! Like some more truffle sauce with that ? ( KISSING ) MAN : Excuse me , but the gentleman ... can 't eat off the floor . He 's not a gentleman . He 's my servant ... and he 's not worthy of our company . Thank you . I 'm truly sorry , sir . Andre , would you please ... ANDRE : No , no , milady . It is not possible . JULIA : Please . Thibault , please , will you let him sit at the table ? For me ? I will please you , lovely one . Obey , foolish wart . ( ALL APPLAUD ) MAN : Thank you . HUNTER : And you were worried they wouldn 't be comfortable . ( SLURPING ) Actually , the floor wasn 't such a bad place for him . Easier to hose down . ANDRE : Cheese ! Very good cheese ! HUNTER : Andre , what are you doing ? What are you doing ? Andre ? No , no ! - Andre , no . - No . Bad ! HUNTER : Hey . Sit down . Eat this . JULIA : Hunter , could you ... No . This is for dessert . All right ? WAITER : Please , sir , please . HUNTER : I 'm sorry . I 'm terribly sorry . Just add it to the check . All right ? Thank you . You eat this after dinner . All right ? No , it 's all right . I 'm terribly sorry . Just add it to the bill . Thank you . WAITER : All right . Do I have something on my face ? You remind me of the daughter of a king . Thank you . HUNTER : On the subject of Julia 's noble ancestry ... you do understand why she was granted control of the estate ? Julia is a Malfete . Everything I have is hers . So you have no objection if she retains control ? - No . - Wonderful . I 'm sure you 'll be very pleased with our plans . HUNTER : They 're going to make us ... I mean you and Julia ... very wealthy . I am already wealthy . I own hundreds of horses ... ten chests of pepper , four hundred bags of wool ... and fifty barrels of Spanish olives . And you own me , sire . Yes , but you have no value . That is true . ( BURPS LOUDLY ) Excuse you . ( PASSING GAS ) THIBAULT : Leave nothing for the devil ! - Did you hear that ? - Yes , I did , sweetheart . They 're not in very good health , all right ? So , just try to ignore it , if you can . ( SIGHS ) - Sire . - What ? ANDRE : I want to make pee-pee . - Ah ! You want to pee ? - Yes . Outside ! Outside ? But , sire ... I could be eaten by the wolves . THIBAULT : Find a torch ! Idiot . ANDRE : Find a torch . Andre has such simple needs . I think that 's great . ( CRASH ) Need some help , sir ? ( TOILET FLUSHES ) Oh , it is beautiful . The water comes out by itself . Ha ! ( ANDRE LAUGHING ) It is a magic fountain . Look at this ! Mmm . It smells just like the forest . ANDRE : All the forest is in the small wheel . Mmm . Smell it ! No . No , thank you . You don 't want to smell it ? Enjoy yourself . The castle 's a wreck . HUNTER : So I 'm helping her divide the estate up ... into more manageable , profitable chunks . We 're selling the art and various high-end pieces ... through an outlet here . Essentially , I 'm protecting her . I see that as my role . And the land ? I decided we should sell that , too . THIBAULT : It is not for you to decide . Only Lady Julia can say what will be done . I speak for both Julia and myself . THIBAULT : You cannot possibly speak for a Malfete . What are your wishes , milady ? Well , um ... I guess I 'd like to think about it ... a little bit more , actually . Julia ? THIBAULT : The lady has spoken ! ( PEOPLE TALKING ) WOMAN : Chicken salad , now ! MAN : I want that cake . Come on now . Don 't take all night . Greasy chicken . HOST : What on earth do you think you 're doing ? JULIA : Hi , Andre . ( PEOPLE GASPING ) ( WOMAN SCREAMS ) I 'm afraid I 'm going to have to add an order ... of chicken a la umbrella to your bill . ( EXHALING ) Smell the forest . Yes , it 's minty . ANDRE : It 's from the blue fountain . JULIA : Nice . Yeah . Oh , all right . Honey , would you like a mint ? - Yeah . - All right . Good . - Thibault ? - Master . ( ALL CRUNCHING LOUDLY ) ( THIBAULT SPITTING ) Those are good . Give me another one . ANDRE : Yes . Very minty . Ow ! WIZARD : Ah ... Good evening , fine sir . WIZARD : I 'm seeking Thibault of Malfete ... the Duke of Anjou . The great chevalier ? ( GUARD RUNS AND SCREAMS ) ( CRASH ) THIBAULT : Andre does not need a bed . He will be happy with some straw . - Yes . - We 're out of straw . My bed is soft . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) ANNOUNCER : It 's time for the " Family Feud . " THIBAULT : Aah ! ANDRE : Oh ! Poor little people . They 're trapped inside ! Oh ! God have mercy . What are we going to do , my sire ? Free them . ANNOUNCER : Chuck , Marilyn , Norma , Terry , and Linda . Now let 's start the " Family Feud " ! Bunny ? You really think these guys have amnesia ? JULIA : I don 't know . ANDRE : We are coming ! So you admit they 're clinically insane ? I didn 't say that . HUNTER : Oh , come on ! ( ELECTRICITY SPARKING ) Where did they go , my lord ? ( MEN SCREAMING ) They were inside . We could not save them . It is tragic . Well , we never really used this room anyway . ANDRE : It 's a pity . ( DOGS BARKING ) Aah ! I need to find a wizard now . Um ... Do you mind if I get some coffee first ? Hi . Jesus Christ ! I 've told you not to leave this stuff ... in the middle of the driveway ! What are you trying to do ? You just about broke my goddamn neck ! I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to . Do you actually do any gardening around here ... or do you just sing out of tune ? MAN : Just clean it up ! Aah ! Oh ! Hey , big belly ! You dare to touch a lady ? MAN : Who the hell are you ? ANDRE : I 'm Andre , and I piss on you . Yeah , well , you get the hell out of here or I 'm gonna call the cops . Apologize to the lady . Lady ? You 're calling her a ... Lady . Right . I 'm sorry . ANDRE : Kiss her feet . - Do what ? - Kiss her feet ! Oh , Jesus ! JULIA : Instead of a wizard ... I think what we really need to find you is a good doctor . Wizards are the best doctors . What in the world is that ? JULIA : What are you doing ? MAN : Call 911 ! THIBAULT : What is going on here ? ANDRE : He was very rude to the lady . Look , fool . A coat of arms . He is a nobleman . I did not know . ( KISSING ) Stupid peasant . - Who are these guys ? - Visitors . THIBAULT : Do you own this woman ? She works for me . Then I will hang my valet by his feet on your behalf . No , please , my lord . Not by the feet ! I prefer the thumbs . I got a meeting to catch . THIBAULT : Rise , idiot . I give him to you for the day . You may beat him if you like . Thanks , but we just met . ANDRE : Thank you , my great and merciful master . Thank you , milord ! Thank you ! THIBAULT : Let us go . We have a wizard to find .

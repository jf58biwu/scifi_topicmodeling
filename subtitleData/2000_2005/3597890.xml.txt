 [ Morris ] Once upon a time , there were three ... how should I put this ... geeks . Three more unlikely heroes there never were . [ Byers ] We defend the defenseless . I don 't see any other way . It wasn 't long before their naiveté ... - [ Click ] - nearly got them killed . So they hooked up with an FBI agent ... [ Byers ] That 's why we like you , Mulder . Your ideas are weirder than ours . And began publishing a ... what shall I call it ... rag ... called The Lone Gunman . [ Langly ] The guys at the NSA and the CIA ... they tremble every time we put out one of these babies . From their cramped basement office ... they pointed fingers at powerful , evil forces . And some not so evil . In their own unique way , the three gunmen were patriots ... fighting the good fight . We tell the stories others refuse to tell . Yeah , that 's one way to put it . And provided , um , expertise ... for their friends at the FBI . She 's hot . For a brief time , it looked like they ... might actually make a difference in this cold , cruel world . They acquired an intern who believed in their cause . [ Jimmy ] You guys fight the lost causes . I want to help . And a powerful beautiful nemesis ... [ Automatic Gunfire ] Who became an ally . But the world is not kind to idealists ... and those who fight the good fight ... don 't always win . [ Sonar Pinging ] Morris ? Morris , it 's going " ping . " Oh , it most certainly is . [ Giggling ] Ping . [ Laughing ] You 're going to make me spill . Mmm . Morris , what is all that stuff , anyway ? Oh , baby , don 't make me talk shop . It is so boring . But I want to know . All right . Well , where do I begin ? You know we 're in the Bermuda Triangle , right ? That place where all those planes and ships ... have mysteriously disappeared ? Who do you think named it the " Bermuda Triangle " ? Wait . You ? Yeah , that was in my former life ... before I joined the private sector . There are a lot of things I can 't talk about ... owing to matters of national security , but I will say this : There are powerful forces out here . Primal ... other-worldly forces ... - Mmm . - Hidden beneath the waves ... just waiting to be ... plucked by man . - [ Engine Approaching ] - Somebody 's coming . Hmm ? Hey , whatever you 're selling ... we don 't want any , okay ? No ganja . [ Woman Screaming ] Ho ! Hey ! Hey ! Wait , wait , wait ... Uh ... Oh , you want the girl ? Yeah , I can dig it . I 'm down with that . Uh ... Oh , wait , wait , wait . Guys , this is a rental . There 's a $ 15,000 deposit on this ... Oh , God ... Your employer wanted me to tell you ... you 're fired . [ Engine Accelerating ] [ Door Opening ] Morris Fletcher ? Finally . What took you so long ? You must be Reyes . Enchanté . Yeah . Mr. Fletcher ... we 've been told you requested us by name . We 're very curious about that . Well , you two head the FBI 's X-Files unit , do you not ? I thought you 'd appreciate what I have to offer . Which is ? [ Chuckles ] You have no idea who you 're sitting here with , do you ? A guy who 's up fudge creek for violating The Federal Secrets Act . How 's that for starters ? Look , l-I 've got top security clearance . I 'm supposed to check in every month ... with my former employer . So I skipped a few phone calls . Big deal . Let me give you a hint . I used to work at Groom Lake , Nevada . Area 51 . I was a Man in Black ! The Men in Black . What , you 've never heard of us ? I saw the movie . Yeah , well , there were a lot of technical inaccuracies in that thing . Anyway , I 'm ready to make a deal . What deal would that be ? The one that saves my furry pink ass . People are trying to kill me . Did you hear about my boat ? Yeah , your female companion told us what she witnessed . My female ... Oh , you mean they didn 't kill ... Brittany ? Brittany . Well , thank God she 's still alive . Look , I need protection . I need to get out of here . You scratch my back , I 'll scratch yours . I can give you guys the keys to the kingdom . UFOs , aliens ... the whole 50 year cover-up . I was there for all of it . Tell me , Mr. Fletcher ... these documents of yours ... are they indicative of the kind of secrets ... you can reveal to us ? Honey ... they 're just the tip of the iceberg . This is the Jupiter 2 from Lost in Space . Okay , yeah , th-those are B.S. , but only those ! See , l-I was freelancing ... for this foreign billionaire . I told him the air force lost a flying saucer ... in the Bermuda Triangle and that I could recover it for him . In the Bermuda Triangle and that I could recover it for him . I just wanted to cruise the Bahamas . I never would 've given him the real thing . That would be un-American . Comin ' out . Well , he found out about it . Now he wants to kill me . I need protection . Super Soldiers . What do you know about Super Soldiers ? A bit . It may be ... there 's one I can help you lay your hands on . This Super Soldier , he have a name ? Not he . She . [ Buzzer Sounding ] What in the hell do they want ? [ Banging On Door ] Gentlemen . What happened here ? Did you get robbed ? No . Uh , we 're upgrading everything . We gave away all our old crap to the Salvation Army . We 're buying totally new stuff . What can we do for you , Agents ? Well , we were hoping you could help us out . You know that for months now ... we 've been investigating this secret cadre ... these , uh , so-called Super Soldiers . Genetically-altered humans . You mean the ones that want to kill Mulder ? [ Reyes ] Exactly . We 'd like your help tracking one down . This woman . [ Reyes ] You recognize her ? She 's , um ... She 's a fellow hacker . Damn fine one . [ Byers ] She calls herself Yves Adele Harlow . Uh , it 's not her real name . [ Frohike ] We never learned her real name . She disappeared a year ago , and nobody 's seen her since . Well , we have reason to believe that she 's resurfaced ... and that she 's become one of these Super Soldiers . [ Frohike Laughing ] What in the hell ... are you talking about ? She 's no Super Soldier . Absolutely not . Not a chance . Who told you that ? [ Morris ] This is pointless . These three monkeys couldn 't find stink in an outhouse . Why are we even here ? You son of a ... Hey , let me at him ! I 'll kill him ! - I 'll hold him down ! - Whoa , fellas ... - You 've got a nerve coming here . - Miserable son of a bitch . Told you they wouldn 't help . [ Doggett ] All right ... everybody just shut up . This man is a professional liar . Every word out of his mouth . [ Langly ] He 's a scam artist . He used us to track Yves down a year ago . [ Frohike ] And then he abducted her . Which is why I know what happened to her . [ Clears Throat ] I facilitated a meeting , is all . And the man I was working for ? I didn 't know in advance ... what he was planning to do to her . Not my finest hour , I 'll admit it . Every word out of his mouth . [ Morris ] Agents ... I 'm telling you , you don 't want these three involved . And they don 't even have their ridiculous Tinkertoy gizmos . This place is like How the Grinch Stole Radio Shack . [ Doggett ] All right , you three know this woman . I want your help . I need to track down this Yves Adele Harlow . Knock , please . Oh . My office hours are 3 : 00 to 5 : 00 Mondays and Fridays . You 'll make time for me , Professor . [ Air Hisses ] Douglas , you ready to go ? Douglas ? [ Gasps ] Airline reservation database . What name do we look under ? Try our old standby ... different anagrams of Lee Harvey Oswald . " Area 51 Exposé " ... ooh ! Where 's your new issue ? This one 's a year old . Back off , Skeezix . You 'll never find her that way . [ Beeps ] He 's right ... no anagrams for Yves Adele Harlow . - So , who 's Joey ? - What ? Joey Ramone ? Leader of the greatest punk rock band in human history ? Now shut up . [ Snickering ] What ? What are you , 34 , 35 ? Why don 't you cut your hair and grow up , huh ? Need I remind you , Fletcher ... that Doggett and Reyes aren 't here to save you . Yeah , well , get yourself a real hero , anyway ... not some dead teeny-bopper . You want to know why Joey Ramone 's my hero ? 'Cause people like you never managed to grind him down . They never stole his spirit . He never gave in , never gave up , and never sold out . Right till his last breath . [ Scoffs ] And he 's not dead . Guys like that , they live forever . Langly ... just ignore him . [ Sighs ] Look , if we have to work together , let 's work together . We don 't have to work together . Well , watching you three try and find your butts with both hands ... is not my idea of a fun time . Now , wouldn 't it be easier tracking Yves ... if you knew her real name ? You know her real name ? Lois Runce . Lois Runce ? Aha . I 'm telling you the truth , boys . Well , if you were , it 'd be a first . [ Knocking ] Nobody knows about that door . That 's our secret door . Does Lois know about it ? Yves ? Jimmy ? Guys ... Jimmy ? How you feeling , man ? [ Morris ] Oh , right . The old errand boy . The guy used to intern for you losers , right ? I wondered what happened to you . Why is he here ? [ Byers ] FBI business . It 's a long story . Where the hell you been , big guy ? Zurich . Then Malta . Then Yemen . And just now New Jersey . It 's been a real geology lesson . I ran out of money , so I hitchhiked here ... then snuck in the back ... 'cause I didn 't know if the place was being watched . [ Sighs ] I just had to see you guys . It 's about Lois . Lois Runce ? That 's Yves 's real name . I told you so . Hey , wait a minute . You tracked her all over the world ? You ? [ Sighs ] Mr. Brainpower here is lucky to be alive . Why did you send him ? Were you trying to get him killed ? He sent himself to find Yves . We tried to talk him out of it . Yeah , and now I almost wish you had . Jimmy , what is it ? Are you all right ? Last night I traced her ... to a little college in New Jersey . It 's the closest I 've been in a year of searching . I saw her . I actually laid my eyes on her ... I called to her ... but she ran . Later on , I found out ... Guys , I think she murdered somebody . One down . John Gillnitz ? I 'm Agent Reyes , and this is Agent Doggett . Is this the woman you saw last night ? It was dark . It could have been her . Do you have her in custody ? We 're working on it . Sir , what can you tell us about your friend ? Have any reason why he may have been targeted ? Absolutely none . Douglas was a wonderful teacher and an even better researcher . What did he research ? Elasmobranchii ... sharks , rays and skates . He was a marine biologist ? An immunologist . Sharks have a remarkable immune system . Toxins that would kill nearly any other vertebrate ... pass right through them . So he did medical research ? Douglas wanted to save the world . Cheer up , Gomer . Bringing the whole room down . This is a computer , Langly . Com-pu-ter . Step away before you embarrass yourself . Always a pleasure , Kimmy . Yeah , yeah . So , then , how do you wish to partake of my hacking genius ? Thanks toJimmy ... we know Yves 's real name . Hey , I told you before he did . Jimmy also told us what kind of car she 's driving ... silver X5 with New York plates . Really ? Way to go , special ed . The New Jersey Turnpike has video cameras ... at every tollbooth . Langly hacked the system ... and spotted her southbound at Newark . Somewhat creative . We spotted her again ... going through the Fort McHenry Tunnel . She passed through not 20 minutes ago . We 're betting she 's headed for D.C. We 're going to try to intercept her with your help . Think you might find ... a military satellite you could piggyback ... give us a bird 's-eye view of the Beltway ? Intriguing . Stand aside , ladies . We 'll be on the cell . I got shotgun . Dream on . You 're staying here . We need somebody we can trust ... keeping an eye on Fletcher . I 'm on it . So , how 'd you like Malta ? The only thing I can say for sure is what killed him . He was injected ... with some sort of tiny poison pellet ... but the wound in his chest was postmortem . What is that ? That 's what I said . My best guess is bioluminescence ... but I 'm still waiting to hear back from our lab . Bioluminescence , as in the stuff that makes lightning bugs glow ? Lightning bugs , plankton , jellyfish ... but generally not dead college professors . So , what ? This stuff was put on postmortem ? No , as near as I can tell , it bled out of him . It gets weirder still . When I opened him up ... I found adhesions that indicate past surgery ... so I 'm figuring I 'll find he had a bypass or a pacemaker . Instead , I find ... this . Looks like cartilage . It is . It was living tissue grafted into him . I have absolutely no idea why . It held something . Something that 's now missing . Could that be the purpose of this wound ? A little ad hoc surgery ? Maybe that was the very purpose of the murder . Whatever was inside him , she removed it . What the hell was inside him ? I have no clue . Seriously , this is the first I 'm hearing of it . Weird organs ? I don 't know what to tell you . You 've never heard of the man ... Professor Douglas Houghton ? You 're looking at me oddly . Perhaps because you 've been known to lie on occasion . Yeah , well , I 'm not lying now . I 've said from the start ... I didn 't know what she was up to . [ Kimmy ] Damn it ! Crashed again ! I cannot make magic with substandard equipment . What 's the problem ? The problem is it 's a freakin ' piece of junk . I knew those guys were broke ... but this is pathetic . The guys are broke ? Are you kidding ? Look around this dump . They had to hock all their stuff ... just to pay the rent . What about this ? Oh , their paper ? Deader than disco . They haven 't published in months . So saving the world doesn 't pay the bills . There 's a hot news flash for you , huh ? The chumps . They were getting by all right ... till you put ' em out of business . Oh , and how exactly did I do that ? When you took Yves . They spent every last dime trying to find her . They 're loyal to their friends . Hilarious , huh ? [ Phone Rings ] Reyes . [ Byers ] You better get here quick . Where are you ? The Hotel Farragut . Hurry . [ Bell Dings ] She 's going to kill that guy . Doggett and Reyes are on their way . By then it 'll be too late . [ Frohike ] Yves , don 't do it ! Lois ? Should I call you that ? I prefer Yves . So , we take it you 're not a Super Soldier . Super what ? Long story . Never mind . Yves , you weren 't seriously ... going to smoke that guy , were you ? I know you three mean well ... but I can 't begin to tell you ... how badly you 've mucked things up . [ Door Opening ] So this guy just up and bolted . He hit her and then he took off . Nobody 's seen him . The room is registered to one Leonard Southall ... of Darien , Connecticut . It 's an alias . It 's a stolen I.D. The real Leonard Southall died in 1996 . You want to tell me who that was ? His real name ... I have no idea . This is your bag , isn 't it ? It 's quite a party you 've got planned for him . Respirator ... surgical gloves ... scalpel . Not to mention this little item here . [ Reyes ] You were planning to cut him open , Ms. Runce ... just like you did the professor . Why ? Yves , that can 't be true . Tell them it 's not . It is , Jimmy . Time is running short . Unless you let me finish what I started ... innocent people will die . You want to elaborate on that ? First things first . Who was it that put you on to me ? [ Groans ] Okay , guys , so she 's not a Super Soldier . I made an honest mistake . Ow ! [ Yves ] As I suspected ... it 's a tracking device . I 'm sure he meant to activate it ... once he knew you had me . You 've been wearing that since Miami . You 've been running a scam on us from the start . Blowing up the boat . The girl as your witness . You planned all that . [ Doggett ] That and all the Super Soldier bull . All that was just to hook us . So then you two would in turn hook us . And we 'd track down Yves for this slimeball ... all over again . Well , what can I tell you ? You three always get the job done for me . Who do you work for , Fletcher ? An international arms dealer ... a billionaire ... and scum of the earth . [ Fletcher ] And ... he 's also ... My father . My father is a murderer ... and a supporter of terrorism . I hate everything he stands for . [ Jimmy ] Yves ... you 're a murderer , too . The man I killed was a terrorist , Jimmy . A zealot whose research was funded by my father ... for its potential as a weapons system . Houghton was an immunologist ... doing research on sharks . [ Yves ] Yes , and he used his knowledge ... of their immune system to devise a vessel of sorts ... one that kept him safe from an engineered virus ... that he carried within him . This man had living tissue implanted in his chest . Cartilage . Shark cartilage . It contains something which you removed . That was this virus you were talking about . I destroyed it , but it was only one of two . Oh , man , the bald dude at the hotel . The one that got away . [ Yves ] Think of him as a human time bomb . He can pass by any sniff dog , any metal detector ... and no one would ever suspect . What triggers this time bomb ? Programmed cellular death ... genetically altered to a high degree of precision . The way the vessel is decaying inside of him ... is virtually clocklike . It will lose integrity and rupture at 8 : 00 tonight . Five hours from now ? [ Yves ] This virus , once it 's airborne ... its kill radius is five or six miles ... depending on the winds . Potentially , it could kill thousands ... tens of thousands . Fletcher ... I know you 're a dirtbag ... but , still , how could you be a party to this ? [ Yves ] Fletcher 's a con man , not a killer . He didn 't know about it . Providing all this is true , how do we track this man down ? Kimmy , zoom in more . Zoom in . Back off , kibitzer , I 'm doing it . This thing is slower ... than Stumpy , my one-legged granny . Where did you get this dinosaur turd ? Stop bellyaching and work . Those things will kill you , you know . Yeah , that 's why I quit 20 years ago . You want one ? So you 're too broke to publish , huh ? Pencil neck told me . It 's a shame . This little rag always was such a hoot . I 'm going to miss it . But , hey , the world spins on , right ? Maybe saving it is a younger man 's game . Or a woman 's . Maybe it is . Got to admit , Byers , it hasn 't exactly been our year . And to top it all off ... we screwed the pooch pretty good today . Maybe we should pack it in . And do what instead ? We never gave up . We never will . In the end ... if that 's the best they can say about us ... it 'll do . [ Langly ] I got him ! [ Kimmy ] It 's my hack , Langly . I got him . We got him , all right ? Our bad guy just rented a blue Corolla ... under his alias , Leonard Southall . We just picked him up on Kimmy 's satellite . [ Kimmy ] Yeah , hauling north like a bat out of hell . New Jersey Turnpike , 30 miles south of Newark . I think I know where he 's headed . [ Nail Guns Popping ] [ Phone Ringing ] Lone Gunman Newspaper Group . Byers speaking . Byers ? John Doggett . Agent Doggett , do you have him ? Oh , yeah , we got him . Listen , how much do you trust ... this Yves Harlow ... Lois Runce ... whatever name she 's telling you ? Completely . Why ? Because the doctors here have run every kind ... of imaging on this guy Southall and come up snake eyes . No virus , no cartilage vessel in his chest , nothing . They found nothing . That doesn 't make sense . [ Byers ] They 're absolutely certain ? One hundred percent . Agent Reyes and I are looking like ... a couple of fools on this one . There must be something we missed . All I can tell you is , we got the wrong guy . There must be a second man . I know there is . It 's basic Terrorism 101 . Except we don 't know his name ... and we don 't know his target . And we 've got one hour to find him . Good evening . You 're good . All my information pointed to that man Leonard Southall . He goes by an alias , he traveled to Washington on this very day . Clearly , he 's involved somehow . He must be . He made a beeline right back to that biology department ... where the dead professor worked . It 's their base of operation . [ Langly ] Yeah , so if Southall is involved ... and yet he doesn 't have the virus inside of him ... So how exactly does he fit into their plan ? Three-card monte . You ever played it ? You have now . What 's that supposed to mean ? It means these guys have you running after the ace ... when you should be chasing the queen . Oh , my God . Southall is the decoy . That 's all he is . You were hot on their trail ... so they gave you someone else to follow . I thought you didn 't know anything about terrorists . I don 't . But , boy , do I know scams . I wasn 't a Man in Black all those years for nothing . They made you work at finding Southall ... which tells me the real guy ... is hiding in plain sight , right out in the open . A friend of the dead professor ? A co-worker maybe . The man who saw me through the professor 's window . The one who identified me . Ladies and gentlemen , scientists ... academic leaders and government representatives . Coming together is our goal this evening ... coming together as one . Those words are easily spoken . But guiding our missile into that fugitive ... and imponderable target is hard indeed . Sorry , conference attendees only . We 're reporters . What newspaper you work for ? The Lone Gunman . Never heard of it . We 're legit , man . Show him your press pass . It 's desperately important that we get in there . Yeah , buddy , come on . These expired last December . We 've got five minutes . We believe there 's a dangerous man ... in that room . Folks , I need all of you to step away right now . Look , thousands of people may die . Mike , I got a situation over by the main conference room . John Gillnitz ! John Gillnitz ! Step back , sir . I 'm really sorry . Where 'd he go ? Split up . Four minutes left . Good luck . Hey , wait ! What do we do with this guy once we find him ? Hold him till I get there . I 'll do the rest . - You mean cut him open ? - If that virus ... gets into the air stream , we 'll have failed . People will die . Whatever it takes . Let 's go . Three minutes and counting . [ Distant Banging ] [ Banging Continues ] Don 't try to run . I don 't have to . Yves , Jimmy , we found him ! Over here ! What do you plan to do ? By my watch , it 's two minutes to 8 : 00 . Not much time for surgery . Yves ! Jimmy ! Now you have a minute forty . Guys . Whatever it takes . [ Alarm Rings ] [ Jimmy ] Byers ! Frohike ! Langly ! Yves , come here . Guys ! Guys ! [ Gurgling ] Oh , God . No . Don 't , Jimmy . Jimmy , don 't . It 's airtight . They 're already exposed . No , guys . Buddy , fight the good fight . Both of you . Never give up . Vaya con Dios , amigos . Arlington . You must 've pulled some big strings ... to get those guys in here . It 's the least I could do . You ready ? Yeah . Dana . I 'll catch up . They meant so much to me . I 'm not sure if they ever really knew . Nobody knew ... what heroes they were . It 's not right . It 's not . [ Morris ] No , it 's not . Langly said to me ... the ones who never give up , they never die . I still don 't know what that means . That means that like everyone buried here ... the world is a better place for them having been in it . It means that they 're gone ... but they live on through us all . [ Child ] I made this .

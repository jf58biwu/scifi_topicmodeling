 Oblongs , Oblongs Down in the valley where a chemical spill Came from the people living up on the Hill There 's a family by the landfill with hazardous foam In their happy glowing home Oblongs And that shows how I 'm directly descended from Cinderella . - But isn 't Cinderella a storybook ? - You 're a storybook . Okay , moving on . Milo , why don 't you tell us about your family tree . As far back as I can trace , my relatives were carnival folk who were touring a place called Hiroshima in the summer of 1 945 . After that , because of their lack of hair and skin they mostly married each other , and here I am . Milo , according to this , your great-uncle was a chimpanzee ? Yes , sir . Uncle Jinky . - Ron ? - l wish you 'd call me Mr. Bergstein . - And my first name is Leland . - Whatever . Okay , we 're having a big fundraiser . I 'm sure you 've all heard about the recent earthquake in , like , China . I mean , the carnage is on every channel . We need money to get cable in the student lounge so we don 't miss our soaps . - l didn 't know we had a TV lounge . - We don 't . No valley kids allowed , especially one-eyed psychos . I 'm not a psycho. I 'm just off . - And that rule 's not fair . - You 're not fair . I mean , why should we donate money for a room we can 't even use ? Ron , it won 't stop talking to me . Don 't forget , student council elections are coming up . Vote for me , Debbie . Hot buttery rolls . The Debbies think they 're so great . Why do there have to be beautiful people anyway ? So the people who aren 't beautiful will know who to follow . It 's all part of God 's great plan . Sexy and deep . Talk about your combo platter . Thank you , dearest . You 're quite a feast yourself . - Get a room . Where you do it . - Yeah , a room . - Nice one , dude . - Thanks . The Debbies run the whole school . It 's just not fair . Now , now being a whiny Wilma will get you nowhere . I want you more now than I 've ever wanted a man . I don 't like the way things are , and I 'm gonna do something about it . Son , don 't rock the boat . The only way we ever achieve change is by doing absolutely nothing over a long period of time . Bob Oblong , you are sex . I 'm gonna go upstairs and start plugging things in . Excuse me . Wait for me ! The meeting will now come to order . I will commence by reading the minutes from last week 's meeting followed by Q and A and reports from committees . Let 's light our farts on fire . Excuse me , but - That 's not in accordance with parliamentary procedure ! I have some new business . The Debbies treat us like dirt . Why don 't we elect someone else student council president ? But nobody 's ever beat the Debbies . How do we know unless we try ? I mean , you could run , Susie . No , no. I have a skeleton in my closet . Oh , wait . No , I forgot. I made soup . - Helga , how about you ? - Are you cranked out of your mind ? I would never run against my dear bosom friend , Debbie . Helga , the Debbies hate you . Look , acorns . Could I be the " presdident " ? I think you just answered your own question . - How about you , Peggy ? - Seriously ? I 'm so psyched and excited you think I have the self-esteem and charisma . Cleanup on aisle seven . She 's out . Well , I guess we should just forget about it . Then things will never improve . Time will pass , we will die , our hair and nails will continue to grow . Fine , then I 'll do it. I 'll run , and I 'll win . Milo , no one is going to vote for a kid who wears a helmet in homeroom . That 's just to protect my soft spot . Great , now I 've lost my motor skills . Free money . Vote Debbie . Cash for your vote . You 're running against me ? - Are you crazy ? - Why , yes . Yes , I am . Hey , you 're supposed to be delivering the freak vote for me , fatty . She means faddy , as in fad or hip trend . You know , because I 'm ultra cool . I 'm going to destroy you . - She is right , you know . - Oh , no , she 's not . Beautiful people are a minority in this school . We have to get to the outcasts , the geeks and freaks the wimps , the gimps , the simps . Yeah , kill them all . - No , no , no . We need their votes . - Right , right . Voting good . Killing bad . And so as president , I 'll see to it that you theater fairies get the respect you deserve . - Any questions ? - One . Singular sensation Every little step you take And I promise that in the future you will not be forced to labor as farmers in America . But we 're the Future Farmers of America Club . Well , then , stay the course . And finally , we promise to build a giant , shade-bearing cross on the lawn . Lord , thank you for this messenger . If you want that we should follow him , please give us a sign . Excuse me , Principal Davis ? - lt 's supposed to say " Milo . " - Trust me , " Milk " will get more votes . I 'm so proud of you , son . Pick me up and give me a hug . Tighter. I 'm feeling really emotional . Milo , quit playing with that CPR dummy and get out here for your introduction . Good luck , Milk . And now , without further ado , here are your candidates . First , Milo Ob- - Now give it up for the beautiful fruit of my perfect loins Debbie ! Hey , no fair . You can 't- - My soft spot . I 'm sorry , you guys . You believed in me , and I let you down . Come on , Milo . We never believed in you . Look at them . They heard my message , and now they 've come from near and far to cast a vote for justice and freedom in a thundering tsunami of change . And the winner by a landslide : Debbie . You want maybe I should cut this thing off ? Debbie ! Debbie . The name alone speaks of beauty , grace and individuality . At times like these , we look for answers . Was it cruel fate that brought a thresher-driving heathen into our midst ? Or was it him ? I 'm pretty sure it was fate . Yeah , it was definitely fate . 'Tis only human to cast blame , but the Lord sayeth to forgive . Then again , the Lord sayeth a lot of things . I 'm sorry , Mr. Klimer . I 'll clean that right up . There 's no need for the beanbag gun , sir . Wow , he 's really not himself since his daughter got ground up into bits and sprayed all over the gym . That would put me off my waffles . Sir , when my mama passed over opening my heart up to this oven mitt brought me great comfort . There was a time when that would really lift my spirits . Mr. Klimer , I know what an ordeal these last few months have been . If there 's anything I can do ... . Maybe there is , Oblong . Why don 't you and your wife come over for dinner , and we 'll discuss it . - You 're inviting me into your home ? - That 's right , and bring that boy of yours . What 's his name , Limo ? Oh , and about dinner , we dress . I 'll make sure Limo wears pants . Hello , Oblongs . I brought you some of my famous 1 2-bean salad . Oh , how divine . - Oblong . - Mr . Klimer . - So how 's the good life ? - Very good . Good . - How 's the grinding poverty ? - Fine . Good . This is unbearable . We tried to be sociable , but then you come in here with your beans . What Pristine is trying to say is we invited you here for a reason . Debbie . She 's alive . We chose to fake her death to spare her the humiliation of being seen like this . - Did you consider plastic surgery ? - This is after the plastic surgery . She 's been so mopey since she became a , you know , monster . So we were thinking , since you have experience with children who are- - How can I put this ? Aesthetically compromised ... . l have no idea what you mean , but go on . We just thought maybe you could give us some advice . Pristine , look . She 's smiling for the first time in months . - Are you sure that 's her mouth ? - Yes . Yes , I believe it is . Maybe Debbie could spend a few days with you , get her freak legs , so to speak . - Sure , she can come home with us tonight . - Great . One thing , though . She doesn 't know how bad she looks . So whatever you do , keep her away from mirrors . Debbie , we have a wonderful surprise for you . No , no. I don 't wanna go to the valley . This car was built in America . It smells like poor people . Well , here we are . Our little house in the valley . Why does the air taste like charcoal ? Keep your mouth closed . Use your teeth as a filter . - Remember , no mirrors . - l 'm on it . I probably would 've just taken them down . Who 's the double-bagger ? Being poor makes people so hostile . - God , how lame are those shoes ? - l told you , no more Buster Browns . - The salesman went high-pressure . - l 'm so angry . - l 'm sorry , okay ? I thought they worked . - They don 't . Boys , this is Debbie Klimer . Turns out her parents faked her funeral on account of she 's so ug- - Pretty good Popeye , huh ? Anyway , Debbie 's gonna be staying with us for a while . - You can sleep with me and Slowie . - Pass-adena . Oh , that 's okay . We have a special room for you . This is Grammy Oblong . She hasn 't spoken or moved in 1 2 years . Hope you don 't mind sharing a twin . Let me explain Grammy 's electronic communicator . A green light means " yes . " A red light means " no . " But a flashing red light , and this is critical means that Grammy 's soiled herself and needs to be cleaned up . Well , nighty night . But it 's only 6 : 30 . Could you please stop snoring ? Debbie , where are you going ? Debbie told me she heard from Debbie that Debbie says she doesn 't like ... - ... Debbie as much as Debbie . - No way . Debbie , you 've gotta come back , or I 'm gonna get in trouble . Like I care. I 'm going back to my real friends . Debbie , Debbie , it 's me , Debbie . Don 't be scared. I 'm alive . - But have you seen yourself ? - No , why ? How could you be so heartless ? I don 't envy you having to live with the guilt . Who wants to look at catalogs ? - l do . - l do . Morning , girls . Gadzooks . Pickles , Debbie 's gone . We have to find her . This mess happened on her watch . - She should have to clean it up . - Milo 's not in his room ... - ... and his window 's open . Who 's that lady ? - Never mind . Come on . Let 's go look for your brother and Debbie . Oh , Lord . Debbie , where are you ? Please , come back . - Debbie , you can 't do it . - Oh , yes , I can . Oh , no , you can 't . I told you . We 've all tried . What 's the point of living if you can 't be beautiful ? Debbie , beauty isn 't everything . Was Mother Teresa beautiful ? No , but she was loved by people all over the world . Didn 't she die right after Princess Diana , but no one noticed because she was ugly ? Look , the point is there 's a lot of people who care about you . Like who ? No one 's gonna wanna be my friend now that I 'm a threshed-up freak . Oh , I think I know a place where looks don 't matter at all . - Gross . - lt 's hideous . How long have those mice been living in your back fat ? I don 't know . But I call the white one Mitzi . Hi , guys . Say hello to Debbie Klimer . She 's alive , and she 's gonna be hanging with us . - Hey . - Hello . Aren 't you repulsed by me ? I 'm the ugliest thing that ever lived . Oh , please . First you have to be the most beautiful . Now you have to be the most ugly . Why can 't you just be a plain old person like everyone else ? Gosh , I can 't believe you guys just accept me after I 've been so mean . I 'm never going back to the hills . I 'm staying here forever-ty ever . Group hug . Debbie , come on . Hurry up in there . What 's going on ? - Now what ? - She 's been hogging the bathroom forever . - l really have to go . - The first hour I didn 't , but now I do too . - Give me the leg . - What are you doing ? Now , boys , don 't fight over the middle leg . Come on , Deb . Give others a chance . I 'm in the middle of a procedure . I need cotton balls , bags and bags of cotton balls . Criminy . I tell you , that girl is really tanning my jerky . I know . She censored my Lewd Dude . Somewhere in this house , there 's a pile of crotches . - What the gosh doodle is this ? - lt 's baby 's breath . Isn 't that a cuter-than-cute little planter ? I can 't smoke this. I 'd feel a fool . I want her out of here . - Me too . - Us too . Try to be patient . The poor dear has been through a lot . I made you a virgin daiquiri , Mrs. Oblong . I said " virgin . " Bitch gotta go . So anyway , my mom says , " Bitch gotta go . " - All in favor ? - Aye . You 'll have to take me kicking and screaming . - We 're talking about Debbie . - Oh . Aye . But she 'll never go back to the hills as long as she 's ugly . And her parents already tried plastic surgery . There 's gotta be somebody else who can fix her . But who ? Only a godless butcher without a shred of legitimate medical training would ever touch this case . Yes , a lot of the children are frightened of my hand . That 's why I operate with this one . Lolly ? I 'm even uglier than before . Oh , my God. I am so a hottie . Even better . You 're a Debbie . You realize if I go back , I 'll have to hate you . I know. lt 's part of God 's great plan . - l 'll never forget you , Milo , Cheryl- - - l 'm Peggy . Right , Peggy . - Derek . - There 's no Derek . - Yeah , you know , tall guy . - No . I could swear he was there the first day . Oh , well . Group hug . - Cute shoes . - Cute shoes . - Cute shoes . - So anyway ... . Bye , Debbie . And back at you .

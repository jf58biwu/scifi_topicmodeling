 We saw the Earth destroyed . And in a heartbeat , everything and everyone we knew ... was gone . There were five of us . The crew of the space shuttle Odyssey . And we were the only survivors . The mysterious being who called himself The Seeker ... rescued us and sent us back in time . And now we have five years to live over . Five years to discover who or what destroyed the earth . Five years to stop from it happening again . The man assured health officials that his member got caught ... in the vacuum during an unfortunate incident while house-cleaning ... and not intimacy with the appliance . This is Morning Breath , Houston 's ... Dear Kurt . You only use ice when you 're drinking ... so I assume you 're in a phase of slow self-destruction . Funny , don 't you think ? After all you 've done to fuck up your life ... it 's left to me to give you this warning . But then no one loves you like I do . You just read this carefully , Kurt ... if you want to keep on living . So I found this website that specialises in blank projects . There 's this guy in California , collects government documents . He 's got over 10,000 of them online ... so I 'm hoping I can get a hit on Bright Sky . You all still waiting on the fellow with the earring ? Honey , this here table is growing weeds . I want to order some food . All right , honey , all right . So today 's special is the Mother and Child Reunion . - What ? - It 's chicken and eggs . - Speak of the devil . - Well , there he is . Who 's that with him ? It 's ... - Is that who I think it is ? - What ? I think so . She wins again , the Queen of SATR : Karena . Oh , my God ! It is . That 's Karena . - I 'll give you all a moment . - That 's Karena . Hello , everyone . Everyone , this is Karen Raines . Sarah Forbes , Neil Taggart , Angela Perry ... and , of course , Roger Ramjet , Hero of Our Nation . - Charmed . - Nice to meet you . - I need cigarettes . - Of course , you do , darling . Yeah . Get a room . - Is that Karena ? - Oh , not yet . She will be . I told you . At the present moment , she 's a waitress at Sizzler , of all places . - Karena , what 's that , a shampoo ? - She 's the Queen of SATR ... or she will be . SATR ? Now what are we talking about , Passover , Last Supper , what ? You know what , Chuck , it 's hip to be square , except in your case . It 's South American Techno Rap , Dad . It 's gonna sweep the planet in a couple of years . - Techno what ? - Rap . Techno Rap . And you 're looking at her new manager . - Jesus , Kurt , what are you doing ? - I 'm gonna launch the SATR craze now . Isn 't that brilliant ? Very soon that girl 's gonna be worth $ 100 million . Oh , that 's right , I forgot . That 's why The Seeker sent us down here . To get rich . Hey , what 's wrong with smelling a little solid gold along the way , Chuckie ? I don 't know about you , Kurt , but I 'm in it for the long haul , not the short bet . Look around , Chuck . We 're a long way from the fucking Odyssey . I think you lost your memory , Kurt . Last time I looked , we were trying to save the world ... and I don 't find that frivolous . Well , I don 't find making money and living well frivolous . - You 're making an ass out of yourself . - Are you actually dating this girl ? - I think he 's in it for the gravy . - You know me . I never go for half measures . We got married this weekend , didn 't we , darling ? - Yes , we did . - Yeah . So I thought you said they were your best friends . Let 's not talk about them , shall we ? Let 's talk about how much I love your voice . Yeah , but what were you saying about my look ? You 're going to have to work on your body art . You 're going to be known for it , you see . This 'll start a new trend . Thousands of people will want to copy every symbol you wear . You always talk about these things like they 've already happened . - In my mind , they have . - What do you mean ? - Trust me . - I don 't know , Kurt . You seem to have a lot of faith in me ... and I just hope I don 't let you down . Believe me , darling . The day will come when you can 't even go to the 7-Eleven ... without causing a riot . Every woman will want to be you . Every man will wanna make love to you . And they 'll be eating their hearts out because I 'm the one who gets to do it . Life can be so beautiful . - Know these guys ? - No . Hello . It 's called Beta-Genics . It 's a multi-national conglomerate . Its main office is in Urbana , Illinois . They just applied for a patent for a new gene therapy procedure . - Okay . - Earth to Angela . - Sorry . - It 's Kurt , isn 't it ? - No . - Oh , please . I saw your face ... when he waltzed in the bar with that young chippy . Oh , you 're reading way too much into this . Kurt and I had a thing in the distant past . Trust me , he 's way too draining to be with . Oh , God , I can imagine . He 's such a little boy . A brilliant little boy , but a little boy nonetheless . - That new girl , she 's just his boy-toy . - She 's his wife . That 's a reality . I 'm gonna get some coffee . - What 's wrong ? - I don 't know . I just got a little dizzy . Maybe I 'm coming down with something . Well , I didn 't get any hits on Bright Sky specifically ... but there 's something going on at Douglas Aimright . They just got the contract for the new orbital propulsion system . - I heard . - Yeah , well , there 's more to it than that . I found some documents on this website that suggests ... there might be a black project hidden in that contract . I 'm gonna need a couple more days to figure it all out ... so in the meantime , I have a trig test to study for . - What are you suggesting , I leave ? - Let me tell you ... taking these high school exams again is like the classic bad dream ... - and I 'm not waking up . - Well , wake up to this . Why don 't you go clean out the garage like your mother said . - She did ? - Yeah . - I don 't remember . - What 's this ? - That 's not mine . - Forget it . I 'll give you a hand . Rule one : You never wanna piss your mother off . And regarding the garage , you always wanna do a little maintenance control so ... - This is a Euro 250 . - That 's right . Wait a minute . Is this the bike that was in the window at Woodman 's ? - Yes , sir . - This is the one ... This is the one that your mother did not want you to have ... 'cause you 're such a reckless youth . - What ? - What ? - The bike . You don 't like it ? What ? - No . Yeah . Dad , it 's a great bike . - It 's just ... - Just what ? It 's the great bike I wanted when I was 17 . - Shit . - And I 'm 22 . Remember , we work together . I got a condo , a Porsche , and a Harley . So ... Had a condo , Porsche , and a Harley . Look , son . Your mother ain 't ever gonna let you have a Harley-Davidson . Let me get that straight now . I give you a Harley-Davidson ... I have to head for the tall grass . You know what I 'm saying ? So let 's just start with the 250 and build back up to the Harley-Davidson . - Meanwhile , clean out the garage . - Yeah . I love the smell of a woman 's sweat in the morning . - Muscles rippling , pecs flexing . - I think you need a new line there , buddy . My God , darling , the music business is the tenth circle of hell . You think they 'd recognise talent when they see it . All they are is afraid of their own shadows . Yeah ? You in the music business ? So to speak . Trying to launch Karena is like pushing Public Enemy at Woodstock . The right sound at the wrong time , believe me . Good luck with that . Sounds like you 'll need it . All right , you 're upset . I guess I don 't blame you . - Why would I be upset ? - Oh , come on , I 'm not an idiot . You 're pretty convincing . Is it the way I broke the news about Karen and I ? Is that it ? Look , am I supposed to know what you mean ? Stop playing dumb . Now look , I wasn 't trying to be a jerk . I know I shouldn 't have sprung it on you like that , but , come on . - Whatever you say . - Angela ? Hey ! Get your hands off me . How do you know my name ? If this is a joke , it 's not funny and I don 't get it . - I 'm not laughing . - Is this guy bothering you ? Mind your own business , Conan . We 're having a conversation . - No , we 're not . - Yes , we are . - Stay out of my face . - All right , let 's go . Take your hands away from me . - Angela , why are you doing this ? - Do you know this loser ? - I 've never seen him before . - What ? Don 't ever touch a woman you don 't know . Next one might make you a soprano . The exit , this way ? Thank you . Shit ! The entire world 's at stake and you don 't call that frivolous ? I call it saving my insanity . I got a new distributor cap and the damn boost won 't sit . I have no idea what that means . - Chuck ? - Yeah . - Something 's wrong . - What ? It 's about Angela . I 'm really worried about her . - What about her ? - I went to see her at her gym . She had no idea who I was . First I thought it was a put-on ... that she was pissed off at me or something , but I was wrong . It was completely real . What the hell do you think it is ? I don 't know . Maybe some lingering effect from her concussion ... - maybe something more serious . - Or maybe she 's just getting your goat . - She likes to push your buttons . - I know , but I think ... you should see for yourself . Will you do that for me ? I 'll give it a whirl . So how 's your first 100 million going , Mario ? I 'm working on it . - How 's married life ? - Oh , heaven on Earth . She wants go to Epcot for the honeymoon . The mere mention of the word Orlando gives me nightmares . I think I would have had to put my foot down if she insisted on Legoland . You know , despite what you think , I 'm all for saving the world . I just wanna have a little fun while doing it , that 's all . - Hey , it 's good to have you back , dude . - Where 'd I go ? You tell me . When you started hanging out ... with those computer geek twins and getting good grades , for fuck 's sake ... - you had me worried , man . - Yeah , it 's all kind of a haze . But this bike definitely redeems you , my friend . - It 's the shit , ain 't it ? - Yeah . - Yeah , it 's the shit . - Yeah , it is . Hey , you remember our Evel Knievel days ... jumping Mr Bentley 's hedges on our 10-speeds ? Yeah , see if this doesn 't bring back some memories . Yeah , it does , dude . You never made it over Bentley 's hedges , either . Kids buy records they can dance to . No one will dance to this stuff . It 's too tribal . Too non-urban . Really , Nostradamus ? Well , what if I were to tell you ... that SATR 's going to become the biggest thing since hip-hop ... - world-wide , huge beyond belief . - SATR music ? - It 's short for South American Techno Rap . - Listen , Mandel . - Mendel . - Yeah , Mendel , don 't get me wrong , okay ? I mean , the girl 's got some ability , a pleasant voice , limited range . - You know , not bad , but nothing special . - Nothing special . Perhaps you shouldn 't have come to L.A. Take her to Nashville . Try the country scene . - That might be more up her alley . - Right . - Irregardless ... - There 's no such word . - Irregardless , we 're simply not interested . - Okay . Now you listen to me . You don 't know it yet , but your label 's in big , big trouble . - Oh , is it ? - Yes , it is . Chantel , the great Chantel star , is secretly obsessing about her weight . She 's headed to rehab addicted to laxatives . It would almost be funny if it weren 't so tragic . - Mr Mendel ... - Dr Mendel , thank you . - Spaghetti-hair , there . - Road Gross . Road Gross . Yes , an appropriate name . He 's gonna choke on his own vomit . He 's gonna go from gross to gone . It gets worse . Two of the members of the Buff and Tumble Boys are about to come out of the closet . No more big TV spots , no more million-dollar endorsements . Irregardless of what you and your alphabetically-challenged team may think ... you need to take a chance . Sign Karena and you may save your label . Trust me , I know what I 'm talking about . You know your way out , right ? Well , if this ain 't the apotheosis of every parent 's bad dream ... to see the kid in jail . - Any cuts , any bruises ? - No , I 'm fine . - You get me out of here ? - Yeah . He 's doing the paperwork . - That was a pretty stupid stunt . - Yeah . Spare me the lecture . What happened to " I 'm 22 , not 17 . I got a Porsche , a condo . - " I got a Harley-Davidson . " - A Harley ? - Yeah , I wish . - You wish ? Look , I learnt my lesson , okay , Dad ? Can we just go home ? Listen , we got a bigger problem . I talked to Kurt and for once he 's right . Seems that Angela 's got a little brain damage . I mean , she doesn 't remember him . She doesn 't remember Kurt . She doesn 't remember the Odyssey ... - doesn 't remember the mission . Nothing . - What mission ? Kurt 's mission . My mission . Angela ... Oh , right . Listen , I 'm going to hold off on that custody release order . - What ? - I 'll just get back to you in about ... What ? I know , I know . You 're going to hate hearing this ... but you will thank me one day . - I promise . - What ? Oh , you 're shitting me , Dad ! Come on ! - Chuck Taggart ? - Wow , I got to tell you . Thank God . Because I know it 's gonna sound a little nutty , but I 'm really happy ... that you know who I am because ... I mean , you 're not surprised to see me , are you ? Well , yeah , I am a little surprised to see you here . - Sure . - Here ? Oh . Right . Is Paul here ? No , he 's not . The coast is clear . Come on in . Corey . Hey , this is Chuck Taggart . He 's an astronaut . - For real ? He go in space and stuff ? - Yeah . I go into space and stuff . - You want to go into space with me ? - Can I , Mom ? - Not today , honey . - Well , I 'll tell you what , champ . We 'll take a rain check . By then you can go into space ... maybe one day when mom says it 's okay . Okay ? - Okay . - Okay . He looks strong . He looks healthy . He 's great . He 's strong , all right . He just broke my vase . Listen , Sarah , we got a big problem . We got some big glitch ... - with the Odyssey . - The Odyssey ? - As in Homer , Ulysses , Odyssey ? - Homer . You know , when I came through that door just then , I mean ... you really knew me , right ? I mean , you didn 't know me ... because you 're a television personality and I 've been on television ... - or did you , you knew me personally , right ? - Yes . I know you personally . We met each other last summer at NASA ... when I was doing that piece on the budget cuts . - Shit . - Chuck , why did you come here ? I gotta go . Holy shit . Karen . I 'm home . Hey , honey , you 're just in time . We 're celebrating my non-success . Hello , darling . What the hell 's going on here ? Don 't worry , baby . It 's just a little tea party . Some old friends dropped by . Those , over there , those are my boys . Your boys . Yes . When I read your unauthorised biography ... - they must 've left out a lot of shit . - What ? Nothing , nothing , darling . Nothing . I know , they hated my demo in L.A. , didn 't they ? There 's only a couple of record companies in L.A. There 's many more where they came from . Don 't worry . Why don 't you just give up because I 'm never going to make it , okay ? I am no star . I don 't even sing that well . You 're the only one who thinks I sing very well . It 's not gonna be that way for long . I promise . - But you have to work with me . - What else am I supposed to do ? You can start by telling these multiple sinners to get the fuck out of my house . You know , you should tell them yourself . I ain 't gonna tell nobody . Chovo . Chovo D. , this is my old man . This is Kurt . Chovo D. Pleasure . Doesn 't surprise me that you 'd marry an old man , Karen . - You didn 't know she was into antiques ? - But I mean , I at least figured he 'd be rich ... - or handsome or some shit . - You 're welcome . I 'm going to go get a drink , if you 'll excuse me . Thank you . - He 's like that . - He 's like that , huh ? Well , I don 't like that . Oh , hello . So , Karen tells me you got some kind of freakish gift . - Some shit about you can see the future ? - Well , though she 's a very excitable girl ... I wouldn 't take anything she says too literally , really . Says you 're a big gambling man . Haven 't lost a football bet all year . Well , again , something of an exaggeration . You might have impressed Karen with your big words and your fancy car . Let me tell you something . It 's time to impress me . You get my drift ? Yes , crystal . Any friend of hers is a friend of mine . - What can I do for you ? - I want you to use your psycho powers . I believe " psychic " is the word you 're looking for . I 'm in the hole and I need a big win . You understand ? - Yes . - One game Sunday . A sure winner against the spread . - And don 't get it wrong . - Right . Let 's see , let 's see . Sunday , the Falcons . The Falcons , yes . - The Falcons will crush the Saints . - The fucking Falcons ? They haven 't crushed anybody . You better not be yanking my chain . Use your two points . I 'm sure of it . It 's ... Trust me . Well , if it ain 't Mr Frivolity ... - Here comes the cavalry . - I 'm dropping five bills on your Falcons . - So you better have it right , for your sake . - Right . - We go way back . - So I see . What the fuck you doing here ? You look like a cop . Hell , I just slid in on the deal , brother . What do you think , I 'm a fucking square ? We got bigger problems . Bigger than you think . We gotta talk . - Oh , really , talk ? - Here ? Well , everybody 's too busy ... destroying the place to pay any attention to us . - Shoot . - Well , listen , they 've all forgotten it . They 've all forgotten the jump in time . Neil , Angela , Sarah , all of them . I had to watch what I was saying . They 'd have thought I lost my marbles . Well , if it 's happening to three of us , then you and I ... No , it 's not ... Wait , wait , just wait . - Chuck . Chuck ? Chuck ! - What ? - What ? - Yeah ! Well , look , it 's got something to do with this download five years ago ... of our consciousness of five years in the future , to now , which is now . It 's got to be something with time travelling and , hell , that ain 't my métier . - That 's your speciality . - It 's not my speciality . I 'm a geneticist . I don 't know anything about time travel . Besides , time travel isn 't a science . It 's a fiction . Fiction ? Your whole goddamn life 's a fiction , man ! Jesus Christ ! We need to do something here . We 're the only two left . You get that ? - And you gotta think ! - I do know this one guy . He 's a theoretical physicist . His speciality is time travel . - And his name is Casper Van Dyke . - Van Dyke ? He 's a painter ? No , no , he 's not the painter . His name 's , anyway , he 's a pompous arse . He 's really quite brilliant . I 've done three conferences with him . - He may be the man . - Anything . - Let 's just get the fuck out of here ! - Well , you lead the way . Come on . They play the Saints twice this year . And you know what ? I think I might 've gotten my games mixed up so please tell your charming friend , Chovo ... not to wage on the Falcons . Please . It 's hard to explain , but it 's very important . Very important . - Bye-bye , darling . Bye . - What the hell is this ? So I called Van Dyke and told him we 're working on a time travel novel together . - Time travel novel ? - Like what happened to us ... except I changed the names and called it Odyssey 5 . There 's five of us . We were on the Odyssey . I get it , I get it . So we 're coming to him because we 're hitting a wall ... - and we need to work on key story points . - Like memory loss . Why ... Bingo . Welcome to the tortured world of writer 's block . - I see . - NASA ? Lame costume , dude . - Charming . - Yeah . So what the hell is a theoretical physicist doing in a joint like this ? Well , there 's something I neglected to mention . He 's not actually a practising physicist . He 's more of a science fiction writer . An award-winning science fiction writer . Wrote such successes , such as Time Squared , Two Times Two ... things like that , you know ? Sweet Jesus . You have to face reality , people . Time travel , as a concept , is right out there with warp drives , beam-me-up ... teleportation and UFOs . All stories of time travel , my novels included ... are exercises in mental masturbation . Real world physics simply doesn 't allow for it . - Just trust me . - Yes . Your novel , Time Marching On , is plagued by fallacies and inconsistencies . Fallacies and inconsistencies ? Page 43 . Two theoretical mistakes . They 're on one page . I mean , come on . You got Adison Barnes ... just walking right into the temporal access port without even switching on his ... Perhaps if you spent a little more time reading carefully ... and a little less time trying to grow a moustache ... we wouldn 't be having this discussion . I 'm just trying to keep your work honest . I wrote you a letter . My work is infinitely better than your taste in flood pants and I got your letter . There were chocolate stains in the margins . Are we in hell ? Check your convention brochures . It says : " Acclaimed lecturer , Casper Van Dyke . " Last time I looked , that was me ... unless you wish to correct me , of course ? Some of you may subscribe to the tenet that everyone is entitled to an opinion . But not while I 'm on stage . Right . Back to reality . As I was saying , time travel : Simply not possible . So I have fans at NASA ? Doesn 't surprise me . We read everything we can get our hands on . - Which is your personal favourite ? - My favourite ? - Of my novels . - Time . The one about time . - The one about New York , Times Square . - Time Squared . - Squared . That 's the one . - Yeah . - That has nothing to do with New York . - Forgive him . He 's an astronaut . So this story of yours , I 'll help you brainstorm , but it 'll have to be next week . Next week 's too late . We have an agenda , a deadline . Well , what 's in it for me ? A first-class VIP tour through the NASA Space Centre . Yes . And a share of the royalties . - My usual consultant split ? - Yes . Yes . - Okay . How can I help ? - All right . It 's a problem concerning the transfer of future consciousness . And this problem is ? Well , as I told you , if two astronauts lose their future memories like the others ... there 'll be no one left to stop the Earth from being destroyed . And the question you need answered is , what is causing the memory loss ? - Right . - Yeah . I 'm telling you , lose The Seeker completely . It takes up way too much time in the story . And this whole business of aliens assuming human form . I mean , come on . It 's the oldest trope in the genre . The kind of stuff they pull in TV when they want to save money on make-up . The Seeker is the goddamn story . Deal with it ! Excuse me , F. Scott-Buzz Aldrin . Casper , we need to focus on what causes the memory loss . What 's the fly in the ointment concerning the consciousness transfer ? Why are these people losing their future memories ? You are asking me to ignore one monumental flaw ... and concentrate on another monumental flaw . No . I have to look at the whole picture . I haven 't begun to address the concept of how an orbital shuttle in low Earth orbit ... could possibly survive the turbulence caused by planetary collapse . The gravitational flux alone would be enough to cause ... every single person in that spacecraft to turn into Jell-O . Would you get this dork back on track before I kill him ? - Hey , I am sitting right here . - Gee , I 'd have never noticed . Listening to this egg-head is giving me worms . Casper , just listen . - No . I don 't work with maniacs . - Casper . Cut him some slack . Between you and me , he 's at the end of his career . His NASA days are numbered . This novel writing is all he 's got left . It 's pathetic . All right , so why wouldn 't the future consciousness hold ? What could disrupt it ? What if The Seeker ... Does he have to be this old man , the alien ... Casper , I 'm going to strangle you ! Suppose The Seeker ... was actually the force behind the destruction of the world ... and he used the astronauts as puppets ... - to start the whole thing five years ago ... - What 's that got to do with that ? - I haven 't figured that out yet . - Chuck ? Hey , what the hell are you doing ? No one touches my computer . Chuck . Chuck ! Is he all right ? Chuck , why did you do that ? What does it mean ? I don 't know . It was a sudden urge . Like when you quit smoking and you have a big meal and you want a cigarette . - Neil . - What about him ? I saw these symbols on Neil 's computer before I went to the jail . - Then he 'd had his future memory loss . - Who 's Neil ? One of the characters from the novel . You guys are taking this thing way too seriously . - Chuck , snap out of it . Chuck , come on . - Yeah . - Come on . - Yeah . - Are you all right ? - Yeah . Right . We may only have a few minutes or days before you lose your memory . Just hang in there . We need to compare these symbols ... to the ones on Neil 's computer . - Right . Can I ask you something ? - Yes . Where in the world did you meet that dipshit ? Oh , it 's a long story . - Oh , God . - What now ? - Nice paint job , Mario . - Well , well , look here , y 'all . If it isn 't the psychic hot line asshole . - I take it my wife never reached you . - Falcons 10 , Saints 28 . And I gave three points thanks to you , asshole . - That 's why they call it gambling . - Well , now I 'm out five grand . - So what do you call that ? - Losing . Now , I was just going to cap this one here ... but I think you need a trip to the morgue , too , Grandpa . My , my . Just look at the lowlifes you two attract . You know this ain 't done yet . Right . By the way , if any of my ideas accidentally show up in your book ... - my lawyer will be contacting you . - Wonderful . - I think you 'd better drive . - Right . The symbols that you and Neil typed must be some kind of unconscious response . They must be part of a larger key . They have to be . - I need a ... I need some aspirin . - Get me a crate of it . - Yeah . - Chuck , this is remarkable . Both texts are nearly identical , like pieces of the same binary puzzle ... but incomplete somehow . You should come see this . It 's really quite remarkable . - Who are you ? - I beg your pardon ? - What are you doing in my house ? - You let me in . You don 't remember . No . And then there was one . - Chuck ? - Sit down . Sit down . You are sitting in my son 's room in front of my son 's computer ... in my house and you 're in Texas , boy . I 'd be well within my rights to shoot you where you sit . You don 't want to shoot me with your granddad 's pistol , do you , Chuck ? I know you 've wanted to kill me from time to time ... but I don 't think you 'd really pull that trigger . How 'd you know it was my granddad 's gun ? You told me in the car , remember ? Pancho Villa ? Colt.45 ? - Naran Chandra 's place ? - I ain 't never been with you in my car . You gotta give me a good reason not to pull this trigger . Of course . Well , because , I hate to admit it , but ... I 'm your friend ... and because I 'm your only hope now . But if I 'm wrong , if you do shoot me ... then you 're going to have to shoot me in the back . That 's not your style , Chuck . I 'm going out . The yellow rose of Texas As far as I can see The yellow rose of Texas Is the only girl for me The yellow rose of Texas As far as I can see The yellow rose of Texas Kurt , I 've been waiting for you for two hours . We 're supposed to be at that party in like 15 minutes . I 'm not going to the party . Did you hear what I said ? I said I 'm not going to the fucking party . Well , you 're the one that said that we should go for my career . It 's an industry party , blah , blah , blah . - Right . Your career . Yes . - What are you doing ? Trying to save six billion people , that 's all . This has to be it . - This has ... What the fuck does it mean ? - Hey , dude , you are cracked . And you know something ? I 'm starting to feel a little sorry for you . Yeah . I feel sorry for me , too . The future survival of the human race rests on Kurt Mendel 's head . - Fuck me , I don 't need the pressure . - It 's always about you , isn 't it ? Look , Karen . I can 't talk right now . I just want you to go to that party , have fun . I need to figure things out . I need to concentrate . Okay ? Well , maybe I need to figure a few things out for myself . Then do it the fuck somewhere else ! Okay ? You don 't even love me , do you ? You 're in love with the idea of what I might become . You know what ? You may be right . I 'm sorry . I 'm gonna go . The symbols . They 're inside my fucking head . I said I 'm leaving . Karen ? What the fuck does that mean ? What the fuck does that fucking mean ? What the fuck ! What the hell happened here ? What the fuck is this ? The man assured health officials that his member got caught ... in the vacuum during an unfortunate incident while housecleaning ... and not intimacy with the appliance . This is Morning Breath , Houston 's ... Dear Kurt . Funny , don 't you think ? After all you 've done to fuck up your life , it 's left to me to give you this warning . But then no one loves you like I do . You must read this carefully , Kurt ... if you want to keep on living . P.S. Go immediately to the bottom dresser drawer . Do not pass go , do not collect $ 200 . Hi . I assumed you 'd recognise your handwriting ... but a picture is worth a thousand words . Yes , it 's me several days ago . You don 't remember , do you ? But there 's a reason for that . I don 't have much time . I 'm about to tell you the strangest story you 've ever heard . It starts five years from now in a shuttle far , far away and ... Hello ? I just came to get a few of my things . You 're Karen , my wife . Not for long . I got a lawyer . It 'll be cheap and easy . Cheap and easy , like so many lovely ladies I know . - Present company excluded , of course . - Whatever . You 're really beautiful . You 're really living like a pig , aren 't you ? - I guess I 'm lost without you . - Yeah ? Well , I 'm not . Chovo 's my manager now . I got a couple gigs lined up , so ... - Good . I wish you luck . Truly . - Would you look at yourself ? You 're sitting exactly where I left you last week . You 're glued to your dumbass computer with all your stupid MIDI code . - Kurt , you need to get a life . - Wait a minute . - What did you say ? - I said get a life . No , no , no . Before that . MIDI ... It 's MIDI code . Don 't you even know what you 're writing ? - MIDI code ? - Musical Instrument Digital Interface ? - What is that ? Tell me what ? - Oh , God , are you that old ? Look , modern music , synth , trans , hip-hop , take your pick ... can be made using a little contraption we call a computer . Yeah . Yeah . Well , don 't be a smart-ass . And go on . Oh , come on , go on . Tell me , please , please . A musician has to talk to his instrument , right ? - Right . - And not in the same way ... that Pete Townsend or any of those dinosaurs you idolize do it . Right . But now , we can lay strand upon strand of musical info inside your computer ... - using digital interface . - Yes . - Those are the symbols you 've been typing . - Yes , yes , yes , yes . Well , of course . This code we 've been typing , it 's some kind of sound . God , I could almost kiss you . There was a time I would 've wanted you to do that . That was then . I think you know how the rest of that goes . Look , Kurt ... just have a nice life . Yeah , you , too . All right . Here goes nothing . I 'm back . Thank you . Hello . Now that I brought you all back , I want to say something . I 'd like to apologise for my frightful behaviour . I guess I learnt my lesson . I 'm really sorry . But no more bitching about my being late . So I was thinking about that memory glitch . I think our brains refused our future consciousness ... the same way a body rejects a transplanted organ . I don 't know if you all remember ... when the time jump was rushed due to Angela 's concussion ... The Seeker never dealt with human beings before , compounding the problem . The musical code , the MIDI code that he implanted in our brain ... was some kind of electronic first-aid kit . The Seeker 's way of trouble-shooting if anything went wrong . Well , what 's wrong with all of you ? Come on , I said I was sorry . - You know this fellow ? - No . No . Who are you ? Very funny . Fuck you ! - Oh , you wimp . Oh , you wimp . - Oh , the baby . Walk away , buddy . Can 't take it . Dish it out but can 't take it .

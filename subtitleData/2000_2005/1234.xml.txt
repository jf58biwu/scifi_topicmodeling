Aren 't you worried ? What , me worried ? It 'll be okay . No , it 's not okay ! Are you a thug or a prosecutor ? I 'm a prosecutor . A prosecutor who beats up the bad guys ... But you have to be reasonable ! I didn 't rough them up that much this time ... You need to turn in another write-up ! I guess I have to write another one ... - Hey , Ji-hyuk . - Did you see this article ? Who would 've thought you and Da-ni would be famous ? wedding BELLS FOR SUPERSTAR BANG Jl-HYUK Did you read the back page ? DODO PRODUCTlONS' BYUN big in JAPAN You set the box office record in Japan . Your next movie ? We 'll have a press conference in a few days . And when will your fianc ? e arrive in Korea ? We 'll have a press conference in a few days . If you plan to visit Japan often , I could arrange a villa rental out there . Don 't worry about it . Should I take you to the office or home ? To the office . Choon-hyang must know about the wedding . - You think she 'll come ? - l 'm not sure . What do you want as a wedding gift ? You 're a big-time DA . Something really nice . You 're the celebrity . I 'm just a poor bureaucrat . Then just get us a pair of baby socks . Baby socks ? Baby ? Already ! Already what ? Da-ni , you 've been so sly . I thought you were just getting a gut . I had no idea you were carrying Ji-hyuk , Jr . Why did you say anything ? Especially to him ! Don 't worry . But the press was going on about your pure love . You must be a little bit embarrassed . It 's not a big deal . You guys are almost married . Some people get married and then break up . Yup , you guys are better off . I 'm off . See you . - Congratulations on your wedding . - Thanks . Take care of the baby . DODO 'S BYUN HAK-DO 'S impending marriage Sung Choon-hyang as Cinderella . It really doesn 't work . The reporters kept hounding me about your fiancee ... You 'd better watch what you say . You still have no clue where she is ? There 's been no trace of her . Everyone believes she 's in Japan , but nobody knows where she really is ... Keep asking around . And send a wedding gift to Bang Ji-hyuk . Make it look like it 's from Japan . No one should know my fiancee isn 't in Japan . Yes , sir . But Choon-hyang may show up at Ji-hyuk 's wedding . After all , Han Da-ni is the bride . Make sure I 'm free that day . And send some flowers . And regarding the department store case , the informant is no longer in touch . I 'm sure he 's been threatened . Organized crime must be involved . If he calls again , assure him of his safety . And we got a call from France . They found the item you were looking for . Oh ? Awesome ! Greatjob . Master , we do the same thing everyday . Can 't we try some flying kicks ? Martial arts are about mental discipline . You must train your mind first . But we still want to try the cool moves .

I tell you a true martial artist does not focus on what is cool . But if you kids insist ... Bring me an apple . One day , you will be able to do this as well . I 'm sorry it took me so long to get this back , Dad . So it went all the way to France . But it 's finally back . Our district attorney is such a good son . Mong-ryong , thank you . But ... What I really want to find again isn 't this sword . I 'm sorry , Dad . I 'm going up to my room . Sure . You 're such a good son ... DA Lee . I found some great prospects for you . I think you really should meet them . One , two , three . Pick one out . - Aren 't they all so pretty ? - More blind dates ? Sure , why not ? I 'm bored anyway . You 're not going to sabotage the date like last time ? What do you mean ? You know I 'm married , don 't you ? Such bad service here ... You don 't mind , do you ? You 'd better not remind me of that . The divorce ? When I got out ofjail , my wife had run away . Don 't worry . I usually don 't beat women . What 's wrong with this thing ? Hey , doesn 't anything work around here ? It is irritating . Do that again , and I 'll kill myself . I 'm all done . Mind if I leave ? I can wait another minute . 59 , 58 , 57 ... Aren 't you going to pick up the tab ? You deserved a beating . That 's why the girls don 't like you . You can 't do that again . Okay ? If you 're that worried , don 't make me go . I 'm in no mood to date , and I don 't have money either . What do you mean you don 't have money ? I spent it all on that sword . I 'm totally broke . Mong-ryong ! Mong-ryong has really grown up . Why doesn 't he want to get hitched ? He should be enjoying himself at his age . You don 't know ? He still isn 't over Choon-hyang . He never even mentions her . He got over her long ago . He did , didn 't he ? It 's been so long . You think Choon-hyang will come to the wedding ? When this cord is all worn out ... That 's when I 'll forget you . Choon-hyang , are you happy ? Boss , Bang Ji-hyuk the actor is really your friend ? But we 've never seen any of Ms. Sung 's friends . If the boss says she 's friends with him , then she is . Can you take me to the wedding ? Me too ! Everyone , back to work . I guess she 's not going to the wedding . Don 't you know our boss is in hiding ? Her ex-husband was a real bum . She 's definitely hiding from him . I can 't imagine her letting a guy hit her . She 's a mystery all right ... Ms. Sung ! All the items on the internet auction are sold out . Chae-rin ! It 's been so long . You just got back from New York last month ? Nice to see you again , Ms. Kim . How have you been ? Long time , no see . I read that he 's marrying his fiancee in Japan . You mean Choon-hyang ? The papers may say that , but who knows ? I went to Japan several times , and I never saw her . He was always alone in Japan too . is that right ? I heard you got engaged in New York . Why didn 't you call me ? I just felt so bad . I 'm sorry , Mong-ryong. I put you through so much back then . I really am sorry . You went through a lot too . Everything 's fine now . I ran into Mr. Byun today . I wanted to ask about Choon-hyang , but I couldn 't . She must be doing fine in Japan . Have you confirmed that she 's in Japan ? Why would I do that ? I 'm over her now . Over her , my behind . Who cares ? Why keep bringing her up ? Yes , let 's stop talking about her . Oh , she sent me a wedding gift from Japan . Some people just take us out for a meal , but Choon-hyang sent us a really nice gift . She 's definitely Mr. Byun 's fiancee , all right . You 'd better stop . I 'm just giving you a hard time , Mong-ryong . She literally left the country , and you aren 't over her . I feel guilty about getting married . Don 't . I 'm over her . Liar . It 's Choon-hyang ! See . You 're still not over her . I was just surprised , that 's all . Choon-hyang ! - That 's enough . - You 're so gullible . - lt 's time you get over her . - Da-ni , that 's enough . Yes . We 're here to celebrate your getting married . Let 's focus on that . Da-ni , congrats on becoming a mom too . - Good luck ! - Thanks . Aren 't you worried you 'll have a girl like Da-ni ? I said I really love ice cream . Forget the ice cream . I said I 'm in love with ice cream , that is . God , I love ice cream . Forget it. I 'll just pretend I 'm the ice cream . Let 's go . Ten minutes ! I 've forgotten her for another 10 minutes . I can do this ! - Any news from the informant ? - Not yet . They may have one of their thugs watching him . Then look into the different syndicates . I 'll be right back after the wedding . Call me if you hear from the informant . - Yes , sir . - Bye . - DA Lee is on the move . - Follow him . Congratulations . Looking good . Will you get Bang Ji-hyuk 's autograph for me ? I won 't see him . I 'm just dropping off the gift . - Hey . Don 't I look pretty ? - Not too bad . I had a great time last night . And I 've been thinking about what you said . My wedding gift really wasn 't good enough . So I got you something else . Thanks . What is it ? Baby socks . How adorable . You didn 't have to get me these so soon . What do you mean ? Only 7 more months to go . Hey , she 's pregnant ! Breaking news ! I 've seen Da-ni . - How does Da-ni look ? - She looks really beautiful . Hey , isn 't that Choon-hyang ? - Now you too ? - But I 'm serious . That 's enough . - Tell us about the pregnancy . - How many months ? Excuse me . - l 'm so sorry . - That 's quite all right . So many people here. I guess you really are a star , Ji-hyuk . - Ms. Sung , it 's so crowded . - lsn 't it ? I won 't even be able to say hi ... lt really is nice to be a celebrity . DA Lee , long time no see . Long time no see , Mr. Byun . You 're here alone ? I think you should mind your own business . Congrats , guys . Congratulations . Choon-hyang didn 't come with you ? She 's still in Japan . Did you get our wedding gift ? Will you tell her that we really miss her ? I will . I 'd better leave this gift and go . Okay . Hooray ! Darn , this car 's got me blocked in . What are they doing all the way from Busan ? Hello ? Can you move your car ? What was that ? Some punk says we need to move our car . Would you register the gift ? I 'll move the car . - Get the car ready . - Yes . Why did they have to put on the parking brake ? How rude is that ? Hello ? I 'm leaving . Have a good honeymoon . You have to take a picture . Otherwise , you 'll never see our baby . Fine , you punk ... Baek , she 's here . Find her now ! He was making such a big fuss about our car . Where did he go ? Don 't worry about it . So many weirdos these days . - Let 's go . - Yes . These Seoul kids are so strange . Let 's go see some of our clients at East Gate Mall . Okay , let 's go . I 'm so envious of those two ... Such a beautiful wedding ... What can I do ? You have that car owner 's number , right ? I 'll call him later . Sir , she 's not down here either . Aren 't you Mr. Byun from Dodo Productions ? You can 't let him find her first . Search every inch of East Gate Mall . Hello ? Sir , we got a call from our informant . He wants to meet right away . I 'll be right over . Who the heck did this ? Hello ? I 'm the one who hit your car ... You can 'tjust leave after wrecking someone 's car . Wrecking ? It was just a fender-bender . What a clown . Did you say a fender-bender ? Yes , a fender-bender . And I never said I wouldn 't pay . I 'll pay . What are the damages ? You will ? You want to know the damages ? I 'm rather busy right now. I 'll get an exact estimate and call you . Busy ? What a joke . You 're paying through the nose . Where are we meeting the informant ? In Youido. lf he 's discovered , he 'll call us again . I think we 're the ones being followed . What should we do ? I 'm sure they want to see the informant . We can 't afford that . Call him and cancel . Won 't the informant feel paranoid ? Reverse psychology . Tell him we can 't trust him . He 'll feel more desperate than paranoid then . He 'll call again . Are you going back to the office ? No , I 'm meeting the person who wrecked my car . This is so funny ... I didn 't even get to say hi to them ... Wait ! Isn 't that Choon-hyang ? So Mr. Byun lied about her being in Japan ... We have to call Mong-ryong . We have to tell him she 's in Korea . But why did Mr. Byun lie ? Ma 'am , cell phone use is barred during flight . Okay ... lt 's not as if we can just hop out ... Hello ? It 's the guy with the car . Let 's turn it over to insurance . Over that ? Tell him I 'll transfer the funds to his account . Don 't want to involve insurance ? A little skittish , are you ? Tell him to mind his own business . I 'll take $ 300 in cash then . 300 $ ? 50 $ ought to do . 50 bucks ? Did I ask for bread crumbs ? I 'm not taking anything less than $ 300 . Or we 'll let our insurance companies handle it . Think it over , and call me again . What 's wrong with this guy ? Hello ? Talk about a punk and a rip-off artist ! You can collect from our clients here . I 'll go settle this thing with that guy . No , I 'll talk to the guy . You can do the collecting . I 'm sorry ? But you put that car under my name . I 'm the one who is responsible . You 're too nice though. I have to deal with a punk like him . That 's what I 'm saying . With your temper , you won 't settle anything . And today 's my girlfriend 's birthday , so we really need to get back soon . Okay , you handle it then . But don 't give him any more than 50 bucks . The only place he knows is the Han River ? We barely tracked him down . But why are they meeting here ? Who knows ? Just keep your eyes open . Someone 's coming . That must be the informant . Who the heck is he ? He must work for the department store . - You 're the owner of the car ? - Yes . Oh my , it 's dented . I 'm so sorry ... Of course it 's dented . You hit it . I 'm so sorry . Enough of that . We 'll let insurance handle it . Actually , the car 's in my name ... But my boss was driving . And my boss won 't pay more than 50 bucks . If it goes to insurance , I 'll end up paying for it ... What am I going to do ? What in the world is wrong with your boss ? I 'm so sorry . Man , he 's begging and pleading . is he begging for his life ? Who knows ? See if he hands anything over . Actually , my boss is really nice . I just feel so bad about the accident ... I just blurted out $ 300 in the heat of the moment . I 'll take $ 100 . Let me give my boss a call . 100 $ ? What a joke . Absolutely not . Tell her I 'm being generous . No , $ 50 bucks , tops . Who 's he calling ? Seems like he 's reporting to someone . Who knows ? The informant must be working for someone . Tell your boss to come here now ! Does he think that I won 't ? Dong-soo , where are you ? I 'll handle this , boss . As you always say , " Mind your own business . " Okay , we 'll settle for $ 100 . Only for you . Make sure to tell him that . Thank you . By the way , my boss is a lady . What kind of woman is so rude and crude ? I can 'tjust hand him bills ... Don 't I have an envelope ? This will do . He handed something over . I wonder what it is ? Who knows ? Once the DA leaves , we 'll get the informant . He has a nice car too . These rich guys can be such jerks . Hello . Hey , it 's our lady boss from Busan . I had some business in Seoul . So I thought I 'd drop by and collect too . How have you been ? Isn 't that the jewelry maker from Busan ? She 's come to collect on everything . She 's such a tightwad for a young girl . She 's famous in Busan for three things : money , guts , and beauty . I didn 't come here to rush you into paying . But you 're one dollar short ... Oh ? You count every penny . Here you go . Thank you . Hey , Mister ! You hurt an elderly lady . Shouldn 't you apologize ? And who the heck are you ? You 'd better apologize . Right away . Why , you ! What ? You 're going to hit me ? Great ! It 's hard to make ends meet anyway . I 'd rather be lying in a hospital bed with your money . Hit me , why don 't you ? Okay , fine . Ma 'am , I 'm very sorry . Hey , you can 'tjust leave . What is it now ? If you 're sorry , you should carry this for her . - Ma 'am , take care . - Thank you . No wonder she 's famous for her money , guts , and beauty . Have you seen this person ? The jewelry maker from Busan ? She went that way . Thank you . The informant from the department store case has voluntarily reported to the authorities . Good . Keep him safe . I 'd like to see him . It 's for you , sir . This is DA Lee . DA Lee . We advise that you drop the department store case . What ? Who are you ? Unfortunately for you , we have the informant . Are you serious ? We know you took money from the informant . We have photos of your rendezvous in Youido . If you don 't want to see Kim Dong-soo hurt , you 'd better stop the investigation ! I 'm sorry ... The owner of that car ... - What are these guys up to ? - What is it , sir ? I think the thugs have kidnapped the wrong guy . This is Kim Dong-soo and his car plate number . See if you can track him down . These are bookkeeping records . But something isn 't right ... Who knows ? Just hold on to them . Are those your financial records ? They belong to my boss ... He 's working for someone ... Fortunately , we tracked them down through the cell phone . Are they idiots ? How did they get the wrong guy ? - Did you ask for police backup ? - Yes . What a strange turn of events ... - He 's the one ? - Yes , boss ! - These are the records ? - Yes , boss . Very good . As for this guy ... Drown him along with his car . Yes , sir . Let 's talk . Sir , they were gangsters working for the department store . This case just got a lot easier . - You own that car ... - l 'm sorry . Oh , no ! The car door is totally smashed . What am I going to do ? Dong-soo , come on . We have to get back to Busan . Ma 'am , the car door is smashed though ... What ? Who the heck did it ? Remember the man whose car we hit earlier ? Well , things happened , and he smashed the heck out of our car . I didn 't do it intentionally . Can you explain the details of the situation ? And the government will compensate you fully . I 'm just supposed to take his word for it ? I 'm going there . Where are you ? I 'm going to the police station . She can meet us there . I 'd like to meet this boss of yours anyway . Like I 'm scared ? Sir , I found her . Bring her here . Choon-hyang ! We already know where you live and work . Mr. Byun 's waiting . Come with me . She should have come now . You must be the owner of the damaged car . Sign here and you 'll get fully compensated . But I should wait for my boss ... - Right here . - Okay . Thank you . I wanted to meet your boss , but she 's not coming . I sincerely apologize for what happened . Have a safe trip to Busan . Come down to Busan sometime . DA Lee . Nice to see you . Come this way . I 've waited so long for this moment ... lt 's the only thing that 's kept me alive ... What would I say if I saw you again ? I 've been preparing the words ... Don 't tell Mong-ryong . I can 't hurt him again . I 'll continue to live as if I don 't really exist . I promise not to go to Mong-ryong . So let me go , Mr. Byun . I can 't let you go this time . Remember that his fate is still in my hands . You haven 't changed at all . I want you to make the choice . I want you to come back to me on your own . To make that possible , I 'll let you go today . And if I won 't come to you ? Will you hurt Mong-ryong ? Dong-soo ! Ms. Sung ! What happened ? Are you okay ? I don 't know . I 'm so confused . I just signed for the damages without your permission . You want to see the DA who smashed our car ? No . Let 's just go back . - Are you okay ? - Yes . I thought you weren 't coming . Hello ? Ji-hyuk ? How 's the honeymoon ? Choon-hyang was at the wedding today . - Was she ? - Mr. Byun lied . I don 't thinks she 's been in Japan all this time . What do you mean ? She hasn 't been in Japan ? I 'll look into it . is something the matter ? No , let 's go . That car 's owner left this behind . I 'll leave it to you to find him . The gangsters thought it contained a record of secret funds . But isn 't this yours , sir ? - Where did you get this ? - From the car 's owner 's bag . - Where 's Kim Dong-soo ? - He 's gone now . By the way , my boss is a lady . So his boss ... His boss is Choon-hyang ? Hello . Speaking . Hello , Mr. DA . Put your boss on the phone now ! He wants to speak to you . Hello ? Hello ? Speaking . - What a clown . - Sung Choon-hyang . Sung Choon-hyang ! Sung Choon-hyang ! Find the address and workplace of the car 's owner . Are you going somewhere ? Busan ! Dong-soo , go back to Busan by yourself . And send me my passport and money from the safe . I 'll call you . What 's going on ? If anyone asks for me , say you know nothing . Take care of yourself . And tell everyone I said goodbye . Huh ? What 's he doing here ? Where 's your boss , Sung Choon-hyang ? Ms. Sung left . She told me not to ask any questions and not to try to find her . Where was she staying ? At the jewelry factory . So you stayed here . You 've been hiding here all this time ... Give me all numbers where l might be able to reach her . Where do I hide now ? Do I have to leave the country ? Sir , Mong-ryong ... I mean DA Lee Mong-ryong is here to see you . Show him in . I 'll take some coffee . I know you 're busy . What brings you here ? I wanted to ask about Choon-hyang . I 'm now president of our alumni association . And I need her address in Japan , so I can send her a newsletter . Why aren 't you saying anything ? Do you not know her address ? How much do you know , DA Lee ? I know she wasn 't staying with you . I 'd thought she left me because of your lies . But I think there 's more to what I don 't know . I 'll find her and get to the bottom of it all . Anywhere will do as long as I can leave right away . Europe would be best without a visa . She 's purchased a flight for England for tomorrow . It leaves at 5 in the afternoon . Good work . You 're excused . Can I ask you a question ? You know this woman , don 't you ? The jewelry maker from Busan ? She came by a couple of days ago . I haven 't heard from her since though . Sung Choon-hyang . You 've become a master escape artist . Hello ? Hello ? It 's been a long time , Mong-ryong . - Where are you ? - Busan . - What ? - Busan . Don 't try to find me . Otherwise , I 'll have to hide somewhere far away . I don 't care . I 'll find you no matter what . You 're still so stubborn . Fine , try to find me then . I will . Where are you going ? You should go home . I wish you 'd stop looking for me . Take care . Sung Choon-hyang , I 've found you . Sung Choon-hyang , you may lift your head . Master ... You 've come to rescue me , my husband . Choon-hyang . Master . Any more damsels in distress ? There 's the one in Pyongyang . The governor there has been asking for her hand . Why do these girls refuse to marry these guys ? Me and my popularity ... I have your badge ready . You have quite a few more to rescue . I see . Let 's go .

 [ Children Chattering ] - Hey . You sure I can 't help ? - Absolutely not . - All set . - Oh , Martha , you make this look so easy . - It 's not too much , you think ? - Are you kidding ? This is just perfect . It 's exactly the way I always dreamt that Easter should be . - Mommy , look ! - Oh , good for you , Michelle . What you 've done is really fabulous . The kids are gonna remember this forever . [ Martha ] I hope there are some things they won 't remember . - What is she doing here ? - Her son is in Michelle 's class , Martha . Be nice . Jenny , hi . It 's good to see you . Hey , Ellen . Martha . [ Wings Flapping ] [ Raven Squawks ] - [ Squawking ] - [ Gasps ] She 's shaken up , Howard . It took me two hours to put her to bed . All I 'm saying is ... No , I didn 't see any bird . But whatever it was , it scared her and she wants to be with her daddy . That 's all I 'm saying . Well , can 't you come home one day early ? All right , fine . I love you too . - [ Squawks ] - [ Gasps ] [ Gasping , Screaming ] - Anything ? - No . She 'll come . It 's a matter of time . Well , I hope you realize there 's no evidence whatsoever ... that this mystery woman of yours has even committed a crime . Though her wardrobe comes close . Ah . Six prostitutes were seen with her at Dirty Dames , never to be seen again . Not only might she be a female serial killer , rare in and of itself , but twice police raided that club to arrest her . And twice they came up empty-handed . She 's on tape goin ' in , the exits are covered . She 's nowhere to be found . What happens to her ? She disappeared ? Turn invisible ? Well , I hope we catch her so she can tell us ... before I have to spend another night here . You know , Mulder , I don 't know about you , but I find this all very depressing . This round-the-clock exposure to the seamy underbelly . It 's a job , Scully . Vigilance in the face of privation . The sheer will that it takes to sit in this crappy room ... spying on the dregs of society until our suspect surfaces . There is something ennobling in that . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] Mulder . Now ? All right . I gotta go . Mulder ? - [ Door Opens ] - [ Scoffs ] - You wanted to see me , sir ? - Yeah , sit down . Two weeks ago , a woman named Martha Crittendon ... disappeared from her home in Bethany , Vermont . Local police haven 't turned up any sign of her . I 'm hoping you may be able to . - I 'm already on a case . - You 're on a stakeout . I 'm confident Agent Scully can continue in your absence . Why ? What did I do ? There may be aspects to this that ... speak to your strengths as an investigator . Specifically ? Ravens . What do you know about ' em ... their mythological or paranormal significance ? Well , the , uh ... the raven is considered a very powerful symbol ... in certain Norse , Celtic and Native-American cultures . Mostly a negative one . Indians view it as a deceiving spirit . Christianity mostly associates it with evil . And then , of course , there 's Poe 's Raven ... and Nevermore and all that stuff . Martha Crittendon 's seven-year-old daughter ... claimed she was attacked by a raven earlier the day her mother disappeared . Later , she heard one inside the house before she discovered her mother was missing . No , really , what did I do ? It 's the only lead that hasn 't been explored . I wanna know if it has any bearing on the case . I 'm also assuming that the fact that Martha Crittendon 's father ... is a federal judge also has a little bearing on this case ? It 's been made clear to me that locating her is my top priority . I 'm making it yours as well . [ Car Approaching ] - Agent Mulder ? - Yeah . Phil Adderly . Welcome to Bethany . I appreciate the help . Sure . I don 't know how much help I 'm gonna be . I know you had a lot of good investigators on the case . - So , uh , you wanna just take a quick look around ? - Great . Thanks . So tell me about Martha Crittendon . Well , she and my wife Ellen , they 're best friends . Martha 's much admired here . She 's devoted to her family , active in the community . I mean , needless to say , the whole town is very concerned . - So , what 's your theory on what happened ? - I 'm hopin ' you 'll tell me . There 's no ransom note , no prints or blood evidence . - Her husband was out of town when she disappeared ? - In Miami at a conference . It checks out . Howard didn 't have anything to do with this . What do you know about a raven ? Yeah , yeah . Michelle , their ... their little girl was saying something about that . Got me . Poor kid . - You wanna talk to her ? - Not necessary . You sure , uh , Martha 's last name isn 't Stewart ? Tell me about it . Last year this place made the cover of New England Home . How many talons would you say a raven had ? Never mind . You know what this is ? Do you know what was hanging here ? It was a mirror . It was found broken . - You had no other signs of struggle ? - Not a one . - Does that mean somethin ' to you ? - [ Door Closes ] Howard , this is Agent Mulder with the F.B.I. Sir . I hope we can help . I appreciate your coming . I 'm wondering now ... if this isn 't just a waste of your time . How so ? With all the police coming and going , this place is a wreck . I was straightening up and I ... found something . Uh , birth control pills . I think Martha was having an affair . After Michelle , we decided not to have more children . I had a vasectomy . They 're in Martha 's name . She ordered them off the Internet . Because I guess small towns talk . Of course , then I started looking all around and I ... found this in the pocket of her favorite coat . I don 't know what this goes to ... or what it means , if anything . But the pills ... Do you have any idea who your wife may have been seeing ? Whoever he is , Martha may be with him . It explains why we haven 't found her . She doesn 't wanna be found . [ Cawing ] Cute kid . Oh , Jenny , you scared me . - You do those up yourself ? - Uh , yeah . I know Martha and you were good friends . You must be pretty upset . Of course . I 'm sure we all are . Maybe you 'd like some to put up on your side of town . My side of town ? - Yeah , sure . - Look , I didn 't mean that the way it kind of sounded . No , it just naturally comes out that way when you think you 're better than everyone . You and Martha are two peas in a pod . Jenny , I don 't think I 'm better than anyone . You and me got more in common than you know . [ Gasps ] Yeah , right . Right . Thanks . Whoever Martha was seeing , the two of them covered their tracks pretty good . Phone records don 't show anything . You think this person took her , harmed her ? I wouldn 't rule it out , but I doubt it . According to your Audubon book , a raven has four talons . That matches the scratches we found on Martha Crittendon 's mantle . You 're not saying a raven 's the reason Martha 's gone missing ? No , no , not a raven itself . But in folklore , ravens are companions to evil ... evil spirits , witches , warlocks , that kind of thing . Agent Mulder , I appreciate the different tact you 're taking on this investigation , but this whole bird thing ? And keep in mind , you 're basing this on the word of a seven-year-old girl . Well , there was also a broken mirror in Martha 's house . Mirrors are considered items of enchantment . A broken one ... means something . I 'm not exactly sure what it is , but ... it means something . [ Door Opens ] Oh . - Hey , sweet girl . - There 's Papa . Agent Mulder , this is my daughter Katie and my wife Ellen . - Nice to meet you . - We 're so glad you 're here . Look , our house is your house . - We have a spare room set up . I 'm sure you 'll be comfortable . - No , that 's ... There 's no arguments . We 're so grateful that you 're here to find Martha . It 's the least we can do . Okay . I should really get the bureau to reimburse you for room and board . - Don 't be silly . This is just a typical meal around here . - Really ? Bill works so much that supper is usually the only time we see each other . - And I like to make it special . - [ Cell Phone Ringing ] [ Groans ] Excuse me . Sorry . Thanks . - Mulder . - Mulder , please tell me I can go home . Hey , Scully . How 's the stakeout ? [ Sighs ] Well , the furnace broke and I can just about see my breath . Ouch . Sorry to hear that . That , and I 've witnessed a couple hundred things I 'd like to erase from my brain . Eeew . [ Groans ] But as of yet , no mystery woman . Well , she 'll come . You know , it 's just a matter of time . She 'll show up . I 'm sure of that . Not before I die of malnutrition . Scully , tough it out . Whatever doesn 't kill you , makes you stronger , right ? - No , no . No capers . Thank you . - I 'm sorry . What ? I said , " What a crazy caper . " I 'll talk to you later . And keep warm . Bye . Did I hear you say something about stakeout ? What 's the case ? Sweetie , this is family time . - Don 't make our guest talk shop at the dinner table . - Fair enough . - Cheers . - Cheers . What 's the matter , sweetheart ? I thought that was your favorite . It tastes different when Mommy makes it . Yeah . I know . How ' bout we go get hamburgers ? Would you like that instead ? [ Wings Flapping ] It 's back . [ Cawing ] - Everything 's all right , sweetheart . I 'll be right back . - Okay . [ Cawing ] What do you make of these claw marks ? Well , one time I saw the victim of a bear attack look something like that . Only bears don 't plant their kill in the rose garden . I was gonna say . The body 's been around here for a while . Probably since she went missing . [ Phil ] What about your ravens ? Howard said something about ravens . Yeah . Feedin ' on her . See ? You okay ? I 'm not arresting ' Howard . I don 't care how it looks . - Body buried in his own yard . He didn 't do this . - I agree . [ Phil ] The poor guy 's suffered enough already . - What are you doing ? You shouldn 't be here . - What ... Oh , my God . - Martha , no . - Ellen , honey , I am so sorry . It can 't be . [ Phil ] It 's okay . It 's okay . The thing that did that to her , I think I saw it today . I saw its reflection . It had a face out of a nightmare . These long claws , the kind that could ... The window shattered . I don 't know how . And when I turned around , it was gone . I don 't know what I thought it was . I didn 't think it was real . How could it be ? But then when I saw Martha 's face ... Honey , you 've been through a lot . You don 't believe me . I do . You said the car window shattered after you saw the reflection . And there 's a broken mirror in Martha 's house . I don 't think that 's a coincidence . - But what could it mean ? - Mirrors are considered doorways . In the Victorian era , they built mirrored rooms called " psychomantiums , " where they thought they could summon forth spirits from the spirit world . Denizens from the spirit world were brought into this world . " Denizens of the spirit world ? " You asked about the raven . The raven is a carrion bird ... attracted to death and decay . What if ... this entity that you saw ... is somehow a personification of that ? What if this creature was brought forth in order to attack Martha ? Then the question becomes who summoned it forth . Ellen , do you know if Martha had any enemies ? Can you think of anyone at all who would have wished her harm ? I sure as hell didn 't have anything to do with it . They 're just routine questions , Miss Uphouse . Answer ' em and we 'll be out of here . We understand there was no love lost between you and Martha Crittendon . And where do you understand that from ? - Mrs. Sheriff , right ? - It 's not exactly a town secret . Right . Like there aren 't enough of those already . Queen Martha and her perfect little Easter egg hunts . [ Scoffs ] She 's so above the rest of us . Except I heard she was steppin ' out on her husband , knockin 'boots with who knows who . I 'm not happy she 's dead and all . But you need to look into that . Well , let 's stay on the subject of you ... on your police record , for instance . You don 't suffer people that don 't give you respect . I 'm thinking of that hair salon owner you assaulted . That was forever ago . And I paid for that . And I had nothing to do with Martha . Where were you the night she disappeared ? At home , all night . I gotta get back to work . I don 't know about you , but I believe her . She didn 't do it . I just don 't get that vibe . Fair enough . But why did she lie about her alibi ? I got that vibe pretty clear . - [ Cell Phone Ringing ] - Excuse me . I 'll be in the car . Mulder . Mulder , when you find me dead , my desicated corpse propped up ... staring lifelessly through the telescope ... at drunken frat boys peeing and vomiting into the gutter , just know that my last thoughts were of you ... and how I 'd like to kill you . I 'm sorry . Who is this ? It 's a freak show , Mulder . It 's a nonstop parade of every single lowlife imaginable . The view may not be too different here . It 's dressed up nicer , but underneath the surface it 's the same seamy underbelly . It 's not the same . Trust me . You know , Scully , this case has turned out to be a little more interesting than I thought . - And I could use your help . - You talking about a reprieve for me ? Well , there 's a murder victim I 'd like you to autopsy . What do you think ? Scully , you still there ? Hello ? - That van is back . - What 'd you say ? - Nothing , Mulder . I 'll talk to you later , okay ? - [ Phone Beeps Off ] [ Banging ] [ Cawing ] Katie ... [ Gasps ] Get away from her ! - It 's okay , hon . Come on . - [ Caws ] [ Screams , Panting ] Be quiet now . Shh . Hush . Be quiet . [ Whimpering ] Oh , God . Ellen ? Ellen , what happened ? [ Cooing ] Are you feeling a little better , Ellen ? Can you ... just talk to me a little bit about what happened ? It came back . It came back ? The ... The creature you saw ? It was here , Phil . It chased me . It 's all right , honey . Please don 't encourage this . This is not what she needs . - I believe she saw something . - And I believe she didn 't . Her best friend just died , for God 's sake . These imaginings of hers are brought on by stress . I have been through the entire house and I didn 't see any indication anyone else was here . - What about the two broken mirrors ? - What about them ? You think broken mirrors have some deeper meaning , but you still can 't tell me what it is . And in this case , I 'm thinking Ellen broke ' em herself . What ? It 's number six . It 's a match to the one Howard Crittendon found in his wife 's coat pocket . - What would this be doing here ? - I don 't know . Ellen , do you recognize this key ? Oh , I was ... sweeping the floor ... and it got caught up in the sweeper . I never saw it before today . You found it before you were attacked ? Right before . Right before I saw the raven . Let me see if my department can run this down and find out what lock it goes to . Hey , I can 't do this anymore . - Can 't , huh ? - No . - We gotta stop . - Well , that 's too bad . - Hey , good morning . - Good morning , Ellen . Wow . [ Chuckles ] - Have you seen my shirt ? - Oh , I 'm sorry . - I left it ... - It 's over here . Oh , Ellen , you didn 't have to go to the trouble . No , it 's no trouble . Actually , it helps me . Whenever my life 's a mess , I just do some housework . Gives me the illusion I 'm in control . - Well , maybe I should try that sometime . - Have a seat . Thanks . Yikes . Wow . It 's just Phil 's breakfast times two . Well , Phil is living large . Where is he this morning ? Uh , probably out on a call . He 'll be back . You ... You just dig in . - Whoa . Ow . - Sorry . - Do you need milk ? - Mm-mm . I 'm fine . I get the feeling you 're not used to anyone taking care of you . Well , that has a ... a vaguely pathetic ring to it . No , I just meant I didn 't notice a wedding band . - Oh . - Do you have a significant other ? Um , not in the widely understood definition of that term . Oh . Well , the right woman will come along and change all that . Don 't miss out on home and family , Mr. Mulder . With all the terrible things you must see in your work ... Well , it could be a refuge for you . [ Door Opens ] - Hi , honey . - Sorry I 'm late . Paperwork . - Good morning , Agent Mulder . - Good morning . I 'm gonna go check on Katie . You sleep well ? I only woke up once , when you went out . Well , I 'll try to be quieter next time . We 've got a deputy out . We 're shorthanded . I had to take some calls . - All night ? - Yeah . We were busy . I spoke to the coroner this morning . The autopsy shows Martha Crittendon was four weeks pregnant when she died , despite her birth control pills . Probably didn 't even know it . Any idea who the father might be ? I mean , Howard 's vasectomy pretty much puts him out of the running . Any inkling who it might be ? Just say what 's on your mind , Agent . You have a piece of evidence in your possession that I 'd like back . The skeleton key . Number six . You wanna tell me what this unlocks ? Once I find out , we 'll talk again . I 'm gonna hit the shower . [ Door Closes ] [ Turns Faucet On ] I know , Brett , sweetie , I 'm sorry . No , I 'm gonna be home real soon . Mommy had to work a double shift . I know . I 'm gonna come home and make you breakfast . No , no , no , don 't eat a lot of cookies . No . Only two . L ... Yes , oatmeal cookies have oatmeal in them . Okay . All right , three . I love you . Bye . [ Cawing ] [ Wings Flapping ] [ Cawing ] [ Creaking ] [ Screaming ] Sheriff , you know that talk I said we should have ? I left her sleeping . So , you were having an affair with both Jenny and Martha Crittendon ? I gotta hand it to you , Sheriff . You put the service back in the " protect and serve . " I cared about both of them . They knew about each other ? But I 'm assuming Ellen doesn 't ? No . But even if she did , she 'd find a way to rationalize it . I 'm not defending myself , but ... two years ago I wanted a divorce . Ellen won 't hear it . She got pregnant with Katie and locked me up good . Well , I figure you got bigger problems facing you right now . I didn 't do this . I swear to you . Anyway , what about the broken mirrors and the raven ? You said that it was an entity that did this . Don 't you still believe that ? I said it was an entity summoned by somebody else . Whether or not they even knew about it , is that possible ? Can I be the reason for all this ... and not even know about it ? [ Ellen On Machine ] Hi . You 've reached the Adderly 's ... Phil , Ellen and Katie . - Please leave a message . - [ Machine Beeps ] Ellen , this is Phil . I was really hopin ' you 'd be home . Look , I 'm in a bit of a situation here ... and there 's things we need to talk about . But Agent Mulder 's on his way over there to explain it all to you . So , if you get this message , you just wait for him , okay ? Thanks . [ Machine Beeps ] I think this sleepy little girl needs a nap . I do . [ Muttering ] I love you . Go to sleep now . Okay , baby ? Ellen ? Ellen ? [ Cell Phone Ringing ] Mulder . - Mulder , I am free . - You 're free ? Mm-hmm . I 'm gonna go home , take a shower for , I don 't know , eight or nine hours , burn the clothes that I 'm wearing and then sleep until late spring . - You solved the X-File . - Yes . Except it 's not an X-File , Mulder . What are you saying ? You didn 't catch our blond mystery serial killer ? Oh , no , we caught her . But , uh , she isn 't a serial killer . Nor is she a blond . And she isn 't even a she . What are you talking about ? What I 'm talking about is these six missing prostitutes aren 't dead , Mulder . They are alive and well in a halfway house ... that was set up by this mystery blond ... who happens to go by the name of Mark Scott Eggbert . And Mr. Eggbert wishes to acquaint lost souls ... with the teachings of Christ . And that 's his hook , I guess . He dresses up like a fellow prostitute ... to make the girls feel at ease . But this vanishing act is no more paranormal ... than a change of wardrobe , Mulder . He goes into a place like a woman and comes out as a man . - Right under ... - Our noses . Exactly . A wolf in sheep 's clothing . Or I guess in this case , a sheep in wolf s clothing . Well , good work , Scully . I 'll call you back later . Ellen ? - Ellen , it 's Agent Mulder . - Please go away . Ellen , Jenny Uphouse is dead . Your husband is in custody suspected of murdering her , only I don 't think he did it . Do you ? Ellen , you went out ... this morning after breakfast . Where 'd you go ? It 's not me . It can 't be . I think it is . Ellen , I think you have a whole other side that you 're afraid to face . That would explain all the broken mirrors . You don 't want to see yourself for what you really are . Ellen , you have to come out of there . Then what ? [ Crying ] My marriage , my life ? Everything I thought I had ... is nothing . It 's all lies . I wish you 'd never come here . Ellen , you need to open this door . [ Roaring ] [ Gasps ] [ Spitting ] [ Whimpering ] [ Door Buzzer Sounding ] You wanna see her ? Does she wanna see me ? The doctors say she 's got some kind of dissociative disorder . A split personality . That doesn 't explain what happened , does it ? I think it 's about as close as science can come . I think the basic idea 's right . There 's some multiple personality disorders ... where an alternate personality displays traits that the host doesn 't have , like nearsightedness or high blood pressure or even diabetes . I think in Ellen 's case , the ... changes were just a lot more extreme . Like ... Jekyl and Hyde ? She wanted so much from her life with you . A perfect life . And I think that at some point she found out you were cheating with Jenny and Martha . I don 't know when , but at some point she did . Like you said , I think she had to rationalize that . And she just bottled up her anger . Swallowed it , and it had to come out some way . I think she did what she did to protect her family . [ Cawing ] [ Cawing Continues ] [ Child ] I made this !

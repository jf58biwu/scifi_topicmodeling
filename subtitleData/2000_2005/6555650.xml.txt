 You know , it 'd be a lot easier for everyone if you would just tell us the sex , Dana . - Did you hear me ? - Yes , I heard you , Mom . For the thousandth time , you can wait . Didn 't you have to wait with us ? I know it 's a boy . I can tell by the way you 're carrying . It 's a boy . You obviously don 't need me to tell you because you already know . Then it 's a boy ? It 's the least you can tell me , considering everything you 're keeping secret . - ( knocking ) - We told people noon , right ? Hi . Your mom said to cover all the bases . - I 'm Lizzy Gill . - Let me give you a hand with that . - I asked Lizzy to help out today . - Oh . Hi . These are gonna need some water . Congratulations , by the way . Mom ... - What do we need help with ? - I don 't know . It 's just ... You shouldn 't have to worry . You have to let people do for you . She 's a very highly recommended baby nurse , by the way . Oh , Mom ! ( Scully ) This has got to be a conspiracy . ( women ) Aw ! Maybe it 'll be twins . Thank you , but I would settle for one very healthy boy . Or girl ! - So many secrets , Margaret . - What do you expect ? She works for the FBI . - Oh , dear ! - I got it . Here . Moving in . The white tornado . - Thank you , Lizzy . - No problem . Just think about it . ( flushing ) - Excuse me , can I help you ? - Dr Lev , isn 't it ? I 'm sorry . I don 't know who you are or how you got in here but we don 't allow visitors . I won 't be visiting long . I 've just come to verify it 's true . Verify that what 's true ? That your work 's been fruitful . I can see that it has by the abomination you 're holding in your hands . You 'll have to leave now . Your work here is done . Dale Jarrett right in the pack battling hard against Ricky Craven for seventh place . Jeff ? Yeah , Mike . I was down in the 88 car pit when Dale Jarrett came in . His car was just a little ... ( racecar commentary continues indistinct / y ) ( knocking ) The last person I 'd expect to see on a Saturday morning . Agent Mulder . You can drop the Agent , Agent Doggett . It 's just plain Fox Mulder now . Right . You want to come in , Fox ? I 'm just watching a race . That 's what I was doing . A slightly different race , though . .. a medical research clinic in Germantown , Maryland , which burned down last night , in what ﬁreﬁghters characterise as an accelerated blaze . Accelerated because of the intensity of the ﬁre , which ofﬁcials say is a deﬁnite case of arson . - Zeus Genetics . That ring a bell ? - Yeah . Scully believed they were putting alien babies in women against their will . Wasn 't ever completely explained . Looks like an attempt to make sure it never will be . That 's more than an attempt . There 's going to be nothing left . I think that 's the idea , to cover up the research going on there . That 's why I came to talk to you . - What do you want from me ? - How about a ride ? Hey , Gene . Not the way I want to spend my Saturday . I had to leave my kid 's ball game . Sorry . I didn 't say you had to come . Fire Marshall thought I was kidding when | asked to sift all this . Seeing it ? I thought I was kidding too . He put you on to this , didn 't he ? What the hell are you doing ? You don 't have to answer to him . He 's out of the Bureau . - He thinks something 's here . - There is . Just nothing the FBI needs to be looking for . ( Mulder ) Agent Doggett ? I hope you don 't mind me dropping your name with the local PD . They 've contacted everyone at Zeus Genetics except for one man , a Dr Lev . - A founder , and head of clinical research . - You think we 'll find him here in the ashes ? That would stand to reason . What is it we 're looking for , being I 'm starting to piss a lot of people off , Mr Mulder ? Pissing people off comes with the territory . It 's part of working on the X-Files . At the risk of pissing you off , I 've wasted enough of my weekend . I told you Dr Lev was a founder of the clinic . Want to know who his cofounder was ? Dr Parenti . Agent Scully 's obstetrician through the first two-thirds of her pregnancy . - He burned down the clinic ? - Don 't know . But if I 'm the agent assigned to the X-Files , I sure as hell would want to ask him . Worst it could do is piss him off . Knock ! Knock ! - We get caught , what you going to say then ? - I 'll just say I 'm with you , Agent Doggett . It 's Saturday anyway , right ? We 're just having a look around . Hey , Mulder . - Who are you ? - Me ? Yes , you . What do you think you 're doing in this office ? I 'm with an FBI agent who 'd like to ask you the same question . Dr Parenti , isn 't it ? I 'm in the middle of a delicate procedure . Whatever you want , you can 't barge in here . I don 't care who you are . This medical procedure , it have anything to do with this ? Please ... Why don 't you tell us what we 're looking at here ? You have no right to be here . I want you to leave . What is this ? Some kind of showroom ? You know what I 've been through in the past 24 hours ? Close friend and colleague is missing . Much of my life 's work has been destroyed . How about you explain what you are doing , what these things are ? They are what we are all working to prevent : children with non-survivable birth defects . Including experiments with alien embryos ? Work you 'd destroy to hide such allegations ? - Where do you get these ideas ? - From a former patient of yours . Dana Scully . If I 'm such a Dr Frankenstein , how is it that Ms Scully is carrying a healthy child ? - In her own medical opinion . - Is she ? I 'd say this man 's suitably pissed off . Why don 't we let him get back to work ? - Let 's go , Mulder . - Thank you . Dana ? Sorry . Horse pills . I 'm about to leave . Your dinner 's in the oven . | just wanted to say that I hope this is working out . It 's important to your mom . It is . And I appreciate your help . I didn 't quite realise how much I needed it . I 'll see you . How 's it going ? - You look unsure . - No . I think she trusts me . Good . We 're almost at the end . You found something , didn 't you ? - You still answering to him ? - We found teeth and a porcelain bridge . - We 're waiting on Dr Lev 's dental records . - Anything else ? Unidentifiable biological material fused with laboratory-grade silica . I know . A lot here is unidentifiable . Doesn 't mean it 's alien . Let 's ask Dr Parenti , if it 's OK with Agent Crane . ( door opens ) Hello ? Hello ? - Packing , Dr Parenti ? - I 'm sorry . This office is closed . Yes , it is . The man loves his work . Dr Parenti ? Agent Doggett . Look at this . Dr Parenti ? ( door shuts ) Dr Parenti ? What the hell is that ? ( Doggett ) Mulder ! Mulder , better come see this . Mulder ? Right there ! Don 't move ! Stop ! Stop there ! Stop there or I 'll shoot ! Hold still , Mulder . This should just about do it . - Scully ! - Sorry . I see why you gave up a career in medicine for the FBI . You 've got manos de piedra . - Sorry . - Imagine if he 'd really connected . - Who ? - Billy Miles . Billy Miles ? - He did this ? - Ask Agent Doggett . He saw him . If you ask me , the kid was whacked out . Whatever it was , he was feeling no pain . - Ask me , the kid isn 't a kid . - Don 't tell me he 's an alien . He is a type of alien . A human replacement . Look at his strength , the way he took those slugs . I 've seen plenty of guys on chemicals keep on coming . You 're ignoring who he is . You , of all people , who 's supposedly running the X-Files . You 're ignoring the fact he bled red blood . Every single X-File I read , and I read them all , Mulder , what you call aliens bleed green , right ? Well , Billy Miles is a whole new deal . He 's an alien abductee who was returned after hideous procedures were performed on him , and who miraculously returns to so-called perfect health when his body sheds its skin . - Same thing happened to you . - Would 've happened if I 'd been left alone . If Scully hadn 't treated me . What was Billy Miles doing at that medical office ? Same as when he torched Zeus Genetics and destroyed their experiments with aliens and the doctors performing them . And what were you doing there , Mulder ? Looking for answers . To what ? - One of those doctors was your doctor . - Mulder ... I need to know that this baby of yours is going to be all right . I 've had it checked over and over again with my new doctor , that I trust implicitly . ( door opens ) Oh , I 'm sorry. ldidn 't ... Come on in , Lizzy . It 's all right . We just need some space to talk . It 's OK . I 've got plenty to do . Excuse me . It 's OK . She 's just helping me out here , at my mother 's insistence . That 's ... That 's all I 'm trying to do . Just make sure nothing happens to you , that this baby you 're carrying is born without any surprises . - Hi . It 's me . We 've got trouble . - Where are you ? At her apartment . She 's with her partners . They 're asking the right questions . Listen to me . She trusts you . You 've got to play to that . You have to keep a cool head . Who are you ? Assistant Director . Things have been rolling , Agent Doggett , all in your direction . PD got the call . Passer-by saw the door of the building open . Name of the victim flagged a previous FBI investigation . - Duffy Haskell . - Yeah . Saw you and Scully on a case involving pregnant women carrying alien babies . Coroner says the way his neck is severed defies logic and the use of any conventional-type weapon . What is this place ? An illegal medical facility for the purpose of human cloning . It goes on from here . It occupies the entire warehouse . You read about these things but don 't imagine they exist . Just like aliens . What ? Are you saying that here they 're making alien babies ? Nobody 's saying that . At least not yet . But what I do have to tell you won 't put your mind at ease . We found prenatal records here . A Dr Lev and a Dr Parenti , working with this Duffy Haskell , monitoring Scully 's pregnancy . Dr Parenti is one of Scully 's doctors but Scully 's checked out fine . - You seem to be missing the point . - And what point would that be ? - What ? - Talk to you a minute ? - There 's been a murder . - We 'll get there . Some business we need to clear up about Scully 's baby , about who the father is . Ahh . I hear there 's a pool running down at the FBI , placing bets . I 've had my suspicions . That is , until I found out that you had questions about Scully 's pregnancy itself . Who the father is , that 's Scully 's business . If you 're asking me how a woman who was diagnosed as barren is about to give birth , that 's an answer I can 't honestly give . Well , I need answers . In light of what we found in there and in light of Scully 's due date , I need hard answers . - Fast . - Sir , just ... - Let me . - ( dials ) ( phone rings ) Lizzy , are you going to get that ? ( phone continues to ring ) Lizzy ? ( rings ) - Hello ? - Scully , it 's me . Are you all right ? - Yeah . I just ran from the shower . - ( door closes ) I need to see you . I 've got Skinner with me . - It 's not something that can wait . - What ? It 's about your pregnancy . Skinner 's got some questions based on new information . - What are you talking about ? - Evidence of interference by someone . What are you doing ? What are you doing with these ? Who are you ? I want you to know you can stop worrying , Dana . Your baby is fine . Everything is absolutely as it should be , 100 % . The pills you were worried about were vitamin supplements . Nothing harmful . Nothing you 'd be afraid to give any expectant mother . I know it doesn 't make sense but it 's a relief , I 'm sure . I am so sorry , Dana . I brought Lizzy into your home . This is all my fault . You know I would never let anything happen to you . I 'd never knowingly let anybody hurt you . I know , Mom . I 'm so worried about you . You keep everything so bottled up . ( Skinner ) Mulder . - How is she ? - Fine . According to her doctor , it was a false alarm . Whatever this woman was up to ... We won 't be able to hold her based on those findings . But Agent Doggett 's been talking to her . I think you ought to hear what she has to say . I knew people would kill for what I know but not like this . We 're not gonna let that happen . Just what you told me and Agent Crane . For ten years , I 've been working as a research scientist trying to produce human clones , long before the media circus with sheep and cows . The work was painstaking , largely unsuccessful , but there was a lot of interest and a lot of money . - Money from who ? - Orders came from government men . But they 're all dead now . But the work continued . We were surprisingly successful with a clone from a human egg and alien DNA . DNA that the government had since 1947 . What do you mean by success ? Alien babies . Birthed by human mothers desperate to conceive . They didn 't live more than a couple of days but tissue and stem cells is what we were after for other experiments . - What other experiments ? - I don 't know anything about that . But I know it was something good . What did you do to Scully ? - We were protecting her . - What did you do ? - No , you don 't understand . - Tell me what 's wrong with her ! Tell me what 's wrong with her baby ! Listen to her , what she 's saying . Nothing 's wrong . That 's what I 'm trying to tell you . The child she is carrying is very special . One could only hope to create that in a lab : a perfect human child but with no human frailties . - Mulder ! - Agent Doggett . I got something . Billy Miles called from a Dr Parenti 's office . He wants to give himself up . All right , let 's get over there . ( knocking ) - Yes ? - ( Mulder ) It 's me . - What 's wrong ? - You alone ? - Yes . My mom just went to ... - Just throw it together . To go where ? No , just stop ! What 's wrong ? Is it something to do with my baby ? Your baby is fine . It 's you who 's in danger now . From who ? From what ? I 'm not sure . I just know I got to get you out of here . I can 't take this . I can 't live like this , as the object of some unending X-File . This isn 't about the X-Files . It is only about you . You are going to have this baby and I 'll do everything I can to protect it . I just can 't do that here . Billy Miles ! Billy . Billy Miles . Agent Doggett . Anything ? ( cellphone rings ) - Mulder . - It 's Doggett . I 'm at Dr Parenti 's ofﬁce . Billy Miles called us to turn himself in , only he ain 't here . - Agent Doggett ... - I know . Something 's wrong . Something doesn 't make any sense . Leave the suitcase . Get in . Go around . ( engine starts ) - Lock your door . - Don 't think that matters much . We haven 't got much time . Get in . Mulder ? Let 's go ! ( Kiycek ) You should all know what it is you 're up against , what Agent Scully is up against . You 're all listening to someone who tried to kill me . He left you for dead . Tell us about Billy Miles . There are others just like him . You can call them what you want : human replacements , alien replicants . - They 're virtually unstoppable . - What do they want ? They want to knock out any and all attempts by us to survive the final days , when they come to retake the planet . So they 're wandering among us looking for trouble ? Some kind of alien lawmen ? You saw what they did to those doctors . They 're fearless . And they answer to no one , except their own biological imperative to survive . - And Scully ? What do they want with her ? - They want my baby . - Why ? - They didn 't even know about it . I don 't know how they could have found out just how important it is , how special . - My baby is normal . - Your baby was a miracle . Born of a barren mother 's barren womb . Are you saying that they 're afraid of it ? They 're afraid of its implications . That it could somehow be greater than them , something ... more human than human . - I don 't believe this . - You wanted to destroy her child . I wanted to destroy the truth before they learned the truth . That there 's a God , a higher power . I don 't believe this crap . I don 't believe you 're listening to it . You know this man 's a liar . You can believe what you want but I don 't think you can take the chance that I 'm wrong . There isn 't a hospital that 's safe enough . - She may never make it out of this building . - Just shut up . ( Mulder ) Agent Doggett . Get on the phone . If we 're going to get Scully out of here we 'll need some help . Agent Doggett ? Agent Doggett , can you hear me ? - I 'm on my way from the airport . - I 'm in the garage . I 've a car waiting for you . - Where are we going ? - I 'll tell you when you get here . If I 'm so full of crap , why all the precautions ? Precisely because you are so full of crap , Krycek . Your ass stays here . - Agent Doggett , where are you ? - Coming around to you . Stop the car . Go . Get out of here . I 'm guessing I don 't have time to go to the little girls ' room ? OK , bring her down . Mulder , Skinner , he 's in the garage ! - Go back ! Go back ! - Get back in the elevator ! He 's on the stairs coming up . - Hey , look who 's back . - He 's in the building . - What do you want me to do ? - You 're going to protect her . Drive safely . Go !

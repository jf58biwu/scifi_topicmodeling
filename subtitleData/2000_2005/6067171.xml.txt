 We can 't keep going like this . You can 't keep pushing us like this , Ed . Your daughter ... We 're close now . I know it . We passed by a lake . We need water . We 'll have water and food , as much as we can eat . So you keep saying , but we don 't seem to be finding it . You heard the radio . Twelve men , an entire unit . The transmission just stopped . They 're out here . - Maybe they 're all dead . - Like we 're gonna be soon . Not if we find their supplies . Find them before anybody else . I 'm thirsty , Daddy . Ripped By mstoll Ed ? Ed ? What 's happening to us , Ed ? We 're sick , real sick . Where 's my baby ? Lizzie ? What ? - What is it , Ed ? Is it Lizzie ? - Get up . - I can 't . - You 've gotta get up . What do you want with us ? [ Hobbes ] A world exists exactly like ours . You live in this world ... your family and friends ... and though you may not know it ... I was sent to save you . [ Voices Overlapping ] It 's just a game . This is Whiskey-04 . Over . [ Man On Radio ] We 've got no signs of activity , sir . No signs of anything at all in this sector . Over . Report , Lieutenant . We found nothing out there , sir . No sign of life . - Why are you here ? - Sir ? - Taking your own orders now , Lieutenant ? - No , sir . - We 've been searching for days . - Then keep searching . Permission to speak freely , sir . You sent us out here to conduct a ground search ... for men who are highly qualified . A unit that 's extremely capable and trained for survival . Yet there 's been no distress signal , no radio contact . Has it occurred to you that maybe these men don 't want to be found , sir ? Do you know what the punishment is for desertion under Santiago law ? - Yes , sir . - Then pray for their sake ... they 're already dead . It 's Waters . I 've got a clear shot . - Make it three against five . - Then what , genius ? These woods are crawling with Republican Guards . A shot now would be suicide . Suicide 's just being out here ... out of water , moving deeper into the forest . - We haven 't eaten since yesterday . - Stick with the program , Hobbes . We 're out here to find that unit , grab their food and weapons and go . We just gotta find them before Waters does . [ Twig Snaps ] [ Rustling ] [ Twig Snaps ] Florence ? You gotta be kidding me . Keep that kid quiet . What 's your name ? She 's sick , isn 't she ? Can you heal her ? Hey . - What 's wrong with her ? - You 're asking me ? Great . Three men and a baby . [ Chatter On Radio , Indistinct ] Lieutenant ! Over here , sir . I found her just sitting here , sir . - Who is she ? - I don 't know , sir . Hi there . Are you hurt ? Are you lost ? We 're looking for a group of soldiers dressed like us . Think you might know where we can find them ? Let 's get her to a vehicle . Take care of her . She 's just a little girl . Yes , sir . What ? - She 's just a kid . - She 's another mouth to feed . Oh , for cryin ' out loud . - Something 's wrong with that kid . - Why won 't she drink ? You 're afraid , aren 't you ? Water made me sick . Mommy and Daddy too . What happened to them ? Men came and took them . I ran . Where ? Where was this ? Stay with her . There 's your unit . What 's left of them . - These guys ? - Santiago 's elite soldiers ... believe it or not . I don 't get it . Looks like they 're unarmed . They got packs . If nothing else , it means they got food . [ Cocks Gun ] Not one word . On your knees . Get your hands behind your head . What have we got here ? Yogi , Boo-Boo and the picnic basket . Hope you boys remembered knives and forks . 'Cause it looks to me like you forgot your weapons . - Where 's your food and water ? - We have no food or water . - Then what are you doing out here ? - Gathering wood and kindling . - Where 's the rest of your unit ? - We 've all laid down our weapons . - You 're deserters ? - Yes . [ Pinocchio ] Good thing we found you before Santiago . Penalty for desertion is execution on the spot . We don 't live by those rules anymore . We live by a new code . We can show you what we mean . Let us take you back to our camp . We have food there . It 's more than you can eat . [ Growling ] [ Barking ] [ Continues Barking ] Please don 't shoot . We won 't harm you . I just want my little girl . You don 't have to be afraid . It 's okay . I think she just wants her mommy . It 's okay , sweetheart . Don 't you want your dolly ? Radio Whiskey-03 . - Tell them our location . - Yes , sir . This is where they are ? The men who look like us ? - This is where you saw them ? - Yes . I don 't get it , sir . What is she showing us ? I don 't know . [ Hobbes ] What the hell is this place ? I don 't know . But whatever it is , it won 't last long out here . I 'd like you to meet someone . If you wait here . I smell food . [ Sniffs ] - It smells like barbecue . You smell that ? - It smells like trouble . I don 't like this place , Hobbes . It gives me the creeps . Like Jonestown . - [ Door Opens ] - [ Man ] Hello . You look tired , hungry . You 're welcome to share in what we have here . - What 's the catch ? - There is no catch . We require no payment . All we ask is that you observe ... - our philosophy of nonviolence . - That 's a nice philosophy . You ought to make up T-shirts with a bull 's-eye on the back . Our strength is our spirit . We know the threat from Santiago , but we refuse to accept it . That 's what drew these men to us . We 'd like to accept your hospitality , but ... there 's someone who 's wondering where we are and someone who 's sick . Your friends are already here . Great . What 's for chow ? All we ask is that you lay down your weapons . Not a chance in hell . Come here . - No way , Hobbes . - No , we got a long way to go . - We gotta eat . - I don 't like it . I don 't like it either . But I 'm hungry . Food better be damn good . Here you go . - How 's the soup ? - It 's good . It 's very good . Good meat . What are you afraid of ? These people are unarmed . They 're eating the same food we are . I 'm not afraid of anything . Come on , honey . Let the people eat . You come with your mommy . That kid knows something . - Hobbes , wait a second . - What are you doing ? Look around . - Nobody 's eating . - Yeah , well . I am . [ Clattering ] - That was my dinner . - Something 's wrong . [ Door Opens ] Republican Guard ? You see ? Like you , these men have given up their weapons . Those men wouldn 't desert Santiago in a million years . - Not for this . Not for anything . - You did . This stinks . I 'm telling you . - Then explain it to me . - I can 't . You just gotta trust me on this one . Let 's get out of here . We won 't make it . Traveling at night without food , without water . You need rest . We all need rest . We head out first thing in the morning . You 're not going to sleep either ? How long you been in Harsh Realm ? Weeks ? A month ? Two ? I 've seen stuff . More than you . These people are not what they appear to be . Then who are they ? - I don 't know . - They 're unarmed . So are you . Did you think of that ? - I 'll take second watch . - You 're a prince . [ Men Chattering , Indistinct ] There . Over there . Hold up . Hold your positions . Must be the kid they found , sir . The little girl they radioed about . - Where are my men ? - There . - Where ? - In the lake . What are they doing there ? You 're lying to me , aren 't you ? She 's trying to lure us down to the lake . [ Electrical Static ] What just happened ? What the hell was that ? Hey . Can I talk to you a minute ? What ? She 's got no fever . But she 's still afraid . Of what ? Where 's Pinocchio ? He was supposed to wake me . Pinocchio ? - Pinocchio . - You looking for your friend ? What happened to him ? - We only heard you calling . - No , you were out here already . You 're mistaken if you think we mean you or your friends any harm . - I 'd like my gun back . - I 'm afraid they were destroyed . Give me my damn gun . I told you we allowed no violence or guns here . Your friend kept a gun . He broke the rules . Hobbes . What 's the problem ? - What 's the problem ? Where 've you been ? - I took a walk . We gotta get out of here . We gotta get back to the car . - Why ? - Why ? For all the reasons you said . There 's something wrong with these people . Hold on a sec , Hobbes . Why don 't you just calm down ? Don 't tell me to calm down . They 've destroyed our weapons . Pinocchio . Hey , buddy . Florence . Something 's wrong . Something 's happened to Pinocchio . I don 't know . He 's just not himself . I need you to watch him close . I 'm gonna go get the car . I 'll be back for you , all right ? [ Lizzie ] No , I don 't wanna go . Let me down . I don 't wanna go . Let me down . [ Sobbing ] Let me go ! [ Wailing ] Just put me down . [ Barks ] [ Vehicle Approaching ] [ Barking ] Pinocchio . What 's he doing out here ? - I don 't know , sir . - What do you know , Sergeant ? If you 're requesting a technical diagnostic ... What the hell 's going on ? The little girl , the lake . I 've lost two units out here , Sergeant . The lake isn 't on our maps . There 's an error in the data . - An error ? - In the game . When Harsh Realm was created ... the programmers had a three percent error rate . Something may be altering or overwriting the program . - Altering it how ? - I don 't know , sir . You 've told me everything you don 't know , Sergeant . You should come to me when you do know , so I can destroy it . Pinocchio , Florence ! Pinocchio , Pinocchio . Republican Guard ... Waters ... they 're five miles from here at the car . He 'll be coming . We 've gotta leave . We 've gotta go . - We 're unarmed . - We 're ready for ' em . Look . You 've gotta listen to me , Pinocchio . You don 't know what you 're saying . You 're being affected by some kind of programming aberration . Nobody 's going anywhere . We 're all staying here . Then you 're all gonna die . It 's suicide . Pinocchio . The Republican Guards are coming . Pinocchio won 't listen . We need our weapons . What are you doing with me ? Florence ? Pinocchio ? [ People Moaning , Groaning ] [ Lock Shuts ] [ Man Shouting ] Move it ! Move it ! [ Man ] Hands on your head ! [ Man ] Move out and check the wood line ! [ Man ] Line them up . [ Man ] Everybody . Come on , move it . [ Man ] Let 's go ! Who 's gonna tell me what 's going on here ? We do not believe in your methods . I wasn 't talking to you . I was talking to my men . - Hear us out . We can feed you . - I want answers ! This is your doing , isn 't it ? - What have you done to my men ? - Your men brought us here . Then where 's Hobbes ? Where 's Tom Hobbes ? [ Gurgling , Rumbling ] I 'm looking for a man named Hobbes . If anyone would like to come forward and tell me where he is ... I 'll spare your life . If not , we 'll begin executions ... starting with the deserters . Then the rest of you one by one . You 've got an hour . Then I start lining you up . What 's happening to us ? Our images were scanned by the lake , copied into new files . Copies which are now luring people to the lake ... to make new copies . Why are we getting weak ? I think our information 's being drained . Slowly being stolen by the doubles . That 's what happened to the girl . Why Florence couldn 't heal her . The lake 's a programming screwup with its own digital mission ... to multiply and replicate . All that nonviolence crap ... is because the copies are fragile . Easily erased . Why don 't they just kill us ? - ' Cause they need us . - For what ? Bait . It 's meat . It 's good meat , ja . Major . Get up . Pinocchio , you can 't give up . Florence ! We 're too weak . No . Listen to me . You can 't give up . We gotta keep trying . They got us divided , Hobbes ... split up . That 's how they want us to die . In cages , unable to help each other . But the little girl got well . Come on . Don 't give up . We gotta keep trying . Right there . Right there , Hobbes . Check him . Pat him down . You were always a brave man , Tom , but never stupid . Why give yourself up ? Those men out there were ready to die to protect you . They mean you no harm . Lay down your weapon . Join us . This isn 't gonna work . You may not believe in our philosophy , but it 's served us well . And we 've attracted many who 've grown tired of living in fear in Harsh Realm . Who are you ? 'Cause you 're not Tom Hobbes . And those men out there aren 't my men . Major Waters . Something in the food , sir . I know where they are . [ Door Opens ] Down here . Your mom and dad are sick . I can help them . Can you open this door first ? Can you do that ? [ Coughs ] Get us out of here , please . They 're butchers . They 're killing us . We 're never gonna make it . Not like this . - What are you doing ? - I 'm gonna go get us killed . Don 't leave us . Please don 't leave us . Please don 't leave us . Shut up ! Hobbes and Pinocchio , were they here ? - Yes . - [ Machine Gun Firing ] [ Electrical Static ] [ Electrical Static ] Seal off the camp ! Find them ! [ Man ] I see him . [ Engine Starts ] Florence , you see him ? - [ Bullets Ricocheting ] - Go ! Go ! [ Gunfire Continues ] Hit it ! [ Bullets Ricocheting ] [ Waters ] On your feet . Everybody up . You think you can kill us all , just like that ? We don 't live by the sword you wear so proudly . Erase these mistakes at once . We 're part of the program , just like you . You 'll never get rid of us . Never ! There 's food back here , water too . Ammunition ... enough for a week , maybe more . It 's more than we need . Take it . - What are you doing ? - That little girl saved our lives . The rest belongs to them . Thank you . Go ahead . Take the truck while you 're at it . We 're gonna starve out here . You said it yourself . You had your chance to eat . It 's like the man said ... " Our strength is our spirit . " [ Engine Starts ] [ Voices Overlapping ] [ Child ] I made this . Ripped By mstoll

 And in a heartbeat , everything and everyone we knew ... was gone . There were five of us . The crew of the space shuttle Odyssey . And we were the only survivors . A mysterious being who called himself The Seeker ... rescued us and sent us back in time . And now we have five years to live over . Five years to discover who or what destroyed the Earth . Five years to stop it from happening again . The argument is very simple . We , as members of a so-called intelligent species ... have a driving compulsion to attach cosmic significance ... to every event in our existence . Simply put , we need to believe that our lives have meaning . Concepts such as free will and self-determination ... are the security blankets we use ... to shield ourselves from the cold , hard truth of reality . And what , may you ask , is this reality ? We are vehicles . Mere vehicles . You can 't control me . I know you 're here . Somewhere . Oh , my God ! Down , get down ! Get away from me ! Get the fuck away from me ! Easy . It 's my fault . I 'm sorry . - Top of the morning . - Morning . I better go . I gotta meet with my friends . All right , see you . Mom . - Dad . - Marc . - Paige ... - Whatever you 've got to say ... if it 's anything to do with time travel or aliens , I don 't wanna hear it . Well , that 's good , 'cause I don 't feel like repeating it . I was gonna tell you , you got a postcard from your mother , and we 're out of milk . Your lunch is in the fridge . You and me again , huh ? Guess we better get used to it . What do you think , honey ? You want Superman or Bobo the Clown ? - Spiderman . - Spiderman ? I don 't think they have any Spiderman . I 'm trying to pick a cake . What do you think ? Two - or three-layer ? Well , it depends on if you 're planning on inviting the entire neighbourhood . Corey 's only gonna turn five once , Paul . Thank God for that . - Accident , Mommy . - I got it , honey . Oh , yeah , by the way , some woman called last night . Said she was someone 's patient . I left the message on the counter . - Thanks . - Take it easy , big guy . Bye , Daddy . Ed Scrivens wasn 't just a flight director . He was ... He was an icon . It 's impossible to fill the shoes of an icon . What changed your mind ? Well , it 's high time the agency had a female flight director . Unfortunately , that makes what I 'm about to tell you that much harder . The decision 's come down from Flight Ops . You 're suspended from the roster indefinitely . I 'm sorry . I expected it . I 'm pushing to have you assigned to mission training . - That 'll keep you in the ... - Putting other astronauts into space ? I know . It 's not even remotely the same thing . It 's all right . It 'll give me something to do while I fight this . You know , this is not how I intended to start my tenure ... keeping astronauts like you on the ground ... while dinosaurs like Chuck Taggart orbit the Earth on a regular basis . Agency could use a few more dinosaurs like that . In my view , it 's high time some of those dinosaurs were extinct . High school . I 'll never get used to this . - Hey , man , what 's with the hair ? - What were you thinking ? - Some party , huh ? - Yeah , yeah . - Man , my throat 's still numb . - I spiked the bong water with mouthwash . - You 're an artist . - Why 'd you ditch ? Yeah , man . You went to use the phone , and you never came back . Hey . You haven 't called me for two days . Give me another two days , I 'll think of a reason . You know , you better watch yourself . Girlfriends like me come around once in a lifetime . Don 't I know it . This , I could get used to . His name is Naran Chandra . He 's a professor , Nobel Prize in mathematics , held a chair at MIT ... was a charter member of the Down Struck Team . - The Down Struck Team ? - It was named after a George Clinton song . They were a group of computer scientists who came together about three years ago ... to develop the first true artificial consciousness . The first thinking machine , if you will . Yeah , and as memory serves , this amalgam of grey matter ... this fantastic rock and roll confab of mental tissue ... - lasted about two minutes . - Right about six months . They had a fundamental disagreement on approach . Naran Chandra was the first one to go . He never wrote a line of code . And we care about this because ? We care about this , darling , because exactly eight days from now ... Naran Chandra is gonna burst into this scientific conference ... and , in the middle of my presentation , he 's gonna put a gun to his head ... and blow his brains out . Oh . - Ruined a brilliant speech , I might add . - I remember reporting on that . Did he say anything ? Will he say anything ? He said something about how it was all his fault ... and that and a quote from Mahabharata . - The Mahaba what ? - The Mahabharata . - It 's a book in Hindu . - Hindi . - Prayers . - Epic poem . Okay . So what 's the quote ? The quote was , " If the radiance of 1,000 suns ... " were to burst into the sky ... " like the splendour of the Mighty One ... " I am become Death ... - " Shatterer of Worlds . " - " Shatterer of Worlds . " - You know it ? - Yeah . It 's what Robert Oppenheimer said as he was watching his first A-bomb explode . Well , that 's encouraging . So what have we got here ? We got A-bombs , we got seek-within-your-own Hindi prayers . How am I gonna get my mind around this ? The point I 'm trying to make , Chuck , is I think he saw the end coming . - I think he felt responsible . - And maybe that is the point . Maybe it 's just one person that 's responsible . Maybe it 's some individual and his goddamn epic poem . God knows there 's enough wackos walking around right now ... ready in the name of God and nation to blow this sphere into shit . Oh , yeah , and what about Project Bright Sky , Mr Defence ? Well , what about genetics , Dr Science ? What about Dr Barantz ? No , most of his patients won 't even talk to me . Now , how come you guys always quiet down whenever I come over ? Because beauty is best contemplated in silence , darling . - Smooth , Kurt . Nice . - Thank you . Like I was saying , there 's one woman . Her name is Lynda Kessel . She called me back . She said she 's been having nightmares . Maybe they got something to do with the experiments . Yeah , or about whatever they 're making inside that tank . I 'm gonna find out . In the meantime , we 're gonna have a talk with your pal Chandra . Preferably before he puts a bullet in his brain . This is Professor Chandra 's masterpiece . It 's nothing less than Darwin inside a machine . These are visual representations of computer code . At this stage , they 're no smarter than your average cockroach . Texas cockroach . They 're programmed to mutate , to fight for survival . Reaper programmes sweep through the preserve and kill off the weakest . So only the assholes and intellectuals survive , right ? In short , you 're trying to evolve artificial intelligence . Computer science has been around for 50 years ... and systems like HAL 9000 aren 't even on the horizon . Professor Chandra realised we needed a new approach . Artificial life is that approach . A-Life for short . Is it working ? We have digital organisms here with the intelligence level of a squirrel . That may not sound like much ... but in the world of computer science , it 's a big leap forward . Anyway , like I said , Professor Chandra 's on sabbatical . He hasn 't been around in three weeks ... so , if I do see him , I 'll tell him you stopped by . Good . He never mentioned he had such famous friends . Well , Naran was never one to drop names . Mr Gonzales , what would happen if one of these digital organisms ... made their way onto the Internet ? Can 't happen . This is a closed system . We don 't even have an Internet connection . Yeah , but Chandra can 't be the only guy in the world working on this stuff . No . Professor Chandra 's work has been duplicated all over the country . So , even if it can 't happen here , it can happen someplace else . The organisms aren 't designed to survive in the wilderness of cyberspace . They 're programmed to absorb only very specific streams of code ... so they 'd probably just starve . Probably just ? Thank you for seeing us , Miss Kessel . We understand you 're going back into the hospital . Well , I 'm going back in for surgery again next week . Seems the benefits from Dr Barantz 's treatments were temporary . Oh , we 're sorry to hear that . Can I ask why you 're so interested in my situation ? A friend of ours was actually involved in Dr Barantz 's gene therapy trials . - Oh . - Unfortunately , he passed away . Not from his illness . He was involved in an automobile accident . - I 'm sorry to hear that . Please . - Thanks . The reason we wanted to talk with you is because ... we believe there may have been a connection ... between the accident and the therapy . In what way ? We think his judgement might have been impaired by the therapy . And when I spoke to you on the phone ... you said that you hadn 't noticed any particular side effects . That 's why I called you . What I said before , it wasn 't exactly accurate . Professor Chandra ? His mail goes back a couple of weeks . Means that he 's either not home , or he doesn 't read it . But I find that hard to believe , otherwise why did he subscribe to this ? - Little tame for you ? - Science is such a lonely pursuit . Kurt , this is his invitation to your symposium , right ? Postmarked yesterday . It 's less than a week off . And where are we going ? You said this dude was really bad off when he broke into your conference . That 's putting it mildly . He was practically a walking corpse . He was probably at the end of his road , and we don 't have much time . Shit . Hand me that box there . - What are you doing ? - Cover your eyes . Fucking hell , Chuck . You wanna get us arrested , of course . Kurt , we are trying to prevent the world from exploding . Try to get some perspective . I have perspective . It 's just centred around me . Hang out here and be the good eye and try not to do anything too scientific . Aye , aye , Chuck . Shit , what a mess . The joys of married life . Chandra . Kurt . Chandra ! I 'm surrounded by fire . It 's everywhere , all around me . But it doesn 't burn . There are people standing around the fire . They 're watching me . Waiting . It 's as if we all share the same secret . It 's that same dream over and over . I just wish I knew what it meant . Do you recognise any of the people in the fire ? I never see their faces . They 're just shadows . But at the same time , I could swear I know them . I know it doesn 't make any sense . No , it probably makes more sense than you think . There 's one other thing . One morning ... this was back when I was undergoing Dr Barantz 's gene therapy treatment ... when I woke up , my legs were covered with rashes . - Rashes ? - Atopic dermatitis . It 's a skin allergy . It happens whenever I come in contact with any kind of grass . Weeds , to be exact . - Had you been outside ? - Well , that 's the thing . As far as I knew , I 'd been in my bed all night . - Chuckie . - How do you feel ? Oh , peachy . I have a third-degree burn under my armpit ... and there 's an inch of flesh missing from my shoulder . Well , what the hell were you doing , experimenting on yourself ? I told you not to do anything scientific . Frankly , I preferred the bastard when he was blowing his brains out during my speech . Look , Kurt , you don 't have the faintest idea ... why Chandra would want a piece of your flesh , do you ? Call me crazy , but I think he was checking to make sure I was human . - Taggart . - Mr Taggart ? Are you still looking for Professor Chandra ? Professor Chandra ? More than ever . Who 's this ? I first noticed it about a month ago . That 's when his behaviour really started to change . How ? He started spending a lot of time on the computer . I mean , way more time than he usually did . He 'd sit there sometimes for 36 hours at a stretch . But he wasn 't working on a new programme . He was searching the Web . - For what ? - I don 't know . Every time I asked , he 'd just become angry . Pretty soon after that , he stopped speaking on the phone . Said it was bugged . Said he was being followed . - So who did he think was following him ? - Everyone . A bag lady , a kid , a cop . He even bought one of those stun guns . You know those things ? Oh , intimately . Yeah , he kept it at the bedside table . He was afraid they 'd get him in his sleep . He even spent some nights on the floor ... to hear the vibrations in case anyone would sneak up on him . Don 't take this the wrong way ... but you seem to be very well acquainted with Professor Chandra 's sleeping habits . We had something going , you know ? - Something going ? - Chuck . Oh . If it got out ... - It ... - Won 't . Antonia Reyes has voted to protect violent sex offenders , gang members ... drug dealers , pornographers , child molesters and drunk drivers . Texas needs a strong leader to help build our communities . Texas needs Brian Perry , war veteran , businessman , devoted father . Reyes will never know what hit her . And voters will never know that her voting record is identical to yours . Well , democracy is an ugly sport ... especially when it 's played on television . Well , we 're tracking five points ahead , but it 's still very early in the game . Well , don 't sweat it , Dad . You 'll win it . Hands down . You sound so sure . Yeah , well , let 's just say I have a premonition . Are you staying for lunch ? I could have Cookie make up some sandwiches . No , I 've eaten . Look , what did you wanna see me about ? Always to the point . Got a lot on my mind , Dad . That business over at NASA , you being grounded ... - I could help . - How ? Well , there 's some people over there who owe me . - I could make a couple of phone calls . - No , thank you . I 've already appealed the decision . Well , from what I hear , the chances of winning that appeal are slim to none . - You 've been checking up on me . - I always check up on you , sweetie . Well , I appreciate that , Dad , but this is my career , and I 'll handle it . I got into space on my own , and I will get back there on my own . I knew I should never have asked you first . I should 've just gone off and done it . How do you think other people in the programme would react ... if word got out that my father was pulling strings to get me back in ? Have you thought about that ? How it 'd look ? Have you thought about how it looks now ? Oh , okay . This is about the election ? So you 're concerned about how this reflects on you . - Of course not . - You 're unbelievable . - How could this be about anything else ? - Wait a minute . Listen to me . This has nothing to do with the election . I just ... I just wanna be part of your life again . You promise me you won 't make any calls ? All right . All right . So I thought about what we talked about . - What we talked about ? - Yeah . I 'm ready to go all the way . Wait , what ? That 's ... That 's ... That 's ... Yeah . I didn 't know until today , but you just ... I don 't know , you seem so different , and so centred . It 's like , I feel like I can handle it now . - So let 's do it tonight . - Tonight ? Yeah . Why wait ? Right . Why wait ? I don 't know . Okay . Let 's see , I 'll borrow my dad 's Mustang ... and then we can go out to the docks . - Shit . - What ? There 's something I gotta do . Just do me a favour and hold that thought . I 'll be right back . Hey , you guys ever see a shuttle launch from Mission Control ? - Didn 't know they did that . - Yeah , if you got the right connections . Well , Chuck Taggart 's your father , isn 't he ? - Yeah , so you know I can deliver . - What do you want ? Access protection 's locked up . It 's beyond my powers . Why not just take it to a pro ? Some stuff on there I 'd rather not get out , if you know what I mean . - This isn 't your laptop , is it ? - You are good . - Hi , Lynda . - Hi . I 'm Dr Jamison . I 'm a friend of Sarah 's . I 'm gonna be taking you through this memory regression session today . I want you to put yourself entirely in my hands . You think you can do that ? - Okay . - Okay . My legs are sore . It 's from the grass , the weeds . Where are you now ? We 're in a field . There 's some columns . Like Roman columns standing there in the woods . - The old Mayfield place . - What are you doing in the field ? We 're burning things . It 's okay , Lynda . These are just memories . They can 't hurt you . What are you burning ? We 're burning medical equipment . Why does that make you anxious ? 'Cause that 's not all we 're burning . Relax , now . Relax . It 's okay . Go from there . What do you see ? They 're cutting up something . We 're throwing the pieces in the fire . What are you cutting up ? Oh , God ! I don 't wanna see it ! I don 't wanna see it ! What is it ? Okay , split up about 20 yards apiece . Fan out . Sweep the area . I hate the goddamn woods . Watch out . Watch these goddamn gopher holes . All right . Let 's see . Would I sleep with my sexy , slightly underage girlfriend ? - Don 't rush me . It 's a tough one . - Yeah , I know , but she 's still 17 . - Well , so are you . - No . On the outside , I 'm 17 . I 'm still 22 , man . I 'm a fucking astronaut , for Christ 's sake . I just don 't know if it 's the right thing to do , you know ? Oh , let me ask you this . The first time around , did you do it ? Yes , but it took another three months to convince her ... and the only reason she wants to do it now is ' cause she thinks I 'm centred . Because she senses that inner power that comes with maturity . It happens to me all the time . Hey , look at it from her perspective . How many 17-year-olds is she gonna find with your experience ? - I assume there 's experience here . - Oh , fuck off , man , yeah . - I heard you went toe-to-toe with Flight Ops . - Yep . Threatened to walk off unless I was reinstated . - Yep . - You can 't do that , Chuck . - We need you in the programme . - Yeah , well , I need you in the programme . I don 't know how all this lays out yet ... but I know the agency played some part in it . The more people I have on the inside ... the better chance I have to stop what 's coming . Besides , you 're the best pilot in the rotation . - Thanks . - How 's your mind ? Well , it takes some getting used to , not flying missions . Yeah , well , don 't get too used to it . Hey , you guys . Over here . I found something . - There really was a fire here . - Looks like they covered it up . - What the hell is that ? - Let 's see . That looks like melted glass . This fire must 've been damn hot to melt glass . Whatever it was those people were making in that warehouse ... this looks like they were trying to get rid of the evidence . Oh , shit . Hang on . Hang on . Don 't try to yank that foot out of there . Just take it slow . I told you to watch out for gopher holes . Relax . - Oh , wait , wait , wait . - Get it off me . Oh , what is it ? Don 't touch it . I need an uncorrupted specimen . - Get it off me ! - Wait , wait , wait . Oh , my God . Damn ! Filthy ! So much for the uncorrupted specimen . Can you see the striated patterns here and here ? They 're much too uniform to have occurred in nature . In my humble opinion , this is not organic . This cheeky little fucker was manufactured . So this is what Barantz 's patients were making in that tank . - This is a piece of it , maybe . - A piece of what , exactly ? I mean , what are we talking about here , some kind of machine ? This isn 't Robby the Robot . This is a highly sophisticated construct on the level of a biological mechanism . Jesus . I really hate it when it does that . So the next question is , who or what wanted this built ? More importantly , why ? Sarah , you gotta get on Lynda Kessel . We gotta get more nightmares out of this woman . - Good luck . - What do you mean , " good luck " ? She has ischemic heart disease , Chuck . It 's a severe constriction of the arteries . It 's why she went to see Dr Barantz in the first place . I called the hospital . She 's stable , but in critical condition . Okay , Kurt , that leaves you and your pal , Chandra , and that computer . Yeah , I 'm still working on his laptop ... but he 's got a serious protection system on that thing . I make one wrong move , we could lose whatever 's on it . Yeah , and we don 't even know if there 's anything on there we can use . We know Chandra 's gonna show up at the science conference . - Why not just wait for him there ? - We 've already interacted with him . The time stream 's already corrupted . That means he could off himself at any time . Tomorrow , five minutes from now , right now . Okay , son , you gotta get into that laptop . Give me another 24 hours . I have great minds working on this . I 'd feel a hell of a lot better if I knew where we were going with this . - Would you please be careful ? - Just relax . - We 're about to get crazy on this . - Oh , Jesus . Wait , are you going through the processor chip ? AUC , Aggressive Umbilical Calibration . It 's our own patented method . - All set ? - Let 's do it . - Dude , what are you doing now ? - Establishing rapport . - Ever hear of neuro-linguistic programming ? - Yeah , yeah , yeah . Well , same basic principle applies here . Shit . Yeah , hello . You were supposed to meet me for lunch . Holly . I lost track of time . I can explain later , okay ? Why are you acting like I 'm some kind of annoying thing ? No , I 'm just in the middle of something here , Holly . It 's really important . All right ? - Oh , well , don 't let me interrupt you . - Holly ... I ... Fuck . - Female trouble ? - Yeah . Capture . - That 's it . - We 're on the go with it . That 's it . Okay , let me see . I 'm compiling this document in the event that something happens to me . - Well , that 's a blast from the past . - Blast from the past ? It 's a brand new Remington , just came out this year . Oh . What , are you going for quail ? Yeah . Bernard Creek 's supposed to be flush this year . Where 's Neil ? Dad . What ? I 've been thinking about what you said the other night ... about my not wanting to become an astronaut . Yeah ? - Well , it was a test , right ? - Test ? Yeah . The programme 's a tough haul . A lot of guys fall out . You 're making sure I really want it , you know , for the right reasons . Well , I just want you to know that hearing you say what you said ... it made me realise that I want it more than anything . I wanna transfer into the programme this year . This year ? Yeah , I made an appointment with John Stiles tomorrow morning . Well , Stiles is a good man . And he knows a good man when he sees one . Flight Ops has revised their previous decision . In lieu of an indefinite suspension from the roster ... you are to undergo a Class I fitness review , including psych training ... to last a period of no less than six weeks . You could be back in space in a few months . Congratulations . May I ask what prompted this revision ? I wasn 't in on the meeting . But you know , don 't you ? Word has it that influence was exerted on your behalf . By Chuck Taggart ? The holidays are long gone . Chuck Taggart no longer wields that kind of influence . Daddy 's little girl . This is all great , but we need something between this and this in size , okay ? And also with these buttons , we need bigger ones ... or make something else , like that big ... You didn 't give a shit about what it would do to me , did you ? - You just went ahead and did it anyway . - Sweetie , this is not the time ... No , you 're wrong , Dad . The time is right now . If I were you , I 'd go ahead and hire some more help ... 'cause you 're gonna fucking need it . I 'm compiling this document in the event that something happens to me . Where did you get this stuff ? - He was uploading it onto his laptop . - It 's sort of like a digital safe deposit box . April 13th . I believe I 've discovered an autonomous agent within the Internet . An artificial life form of unknown origin . It moves through cyberspace like a gigantic worm . It burrows into computer networks , feeds on information . It has attained a level of intelligence that is off any known scale of measurement . It could very well be the most intelligent being on the planet . The most intelligent being that ever existed . I wonder , have I discovered God ? Monday , April 22nd . I can track the Sentient . That 's what I 'm calling it now . It leaves fingerprints , bits of waste code . I 've analysed some of this code . There can be no doubt . The Sentient evolved from A-life forms that I developed . The Sentient is my child . Note to self . Buy more coffee . May 4th . Okay , look at this . - Jarred Ward . You know that name ? - No . Sarah 's running a search on it right now , but nothing yet . I 've spotted this man on three separate occasions . I 'm sure he 's following me . Oh , my God . I 've seen him . Where ? He came by the lab a couple weeks ago asking for the Professor . I told him he wasn 't there , and he left . He give you anything , a name , Jarred Ward , or anything ? No . I do remember he gave me the creeps , though . - Why is that ? - Something about him was just off . June 5th . I was wrong about the Sentient . It is not the most intelligent being on the planet . It is not alone on the Internet . There are others . - That 's it ? - That 's all there is . - Hello . - I got a hit on the name . Jarred Ward sold a piece of property ... to someone matching Professor Chandra 's description . - There 's an address . - Shoot . 14435 Falconer Lane ... just south of Barclay . 14435 Falconer Lane . Where are you ? We 're on our way to Houston General . Lynda Kessel called . She said she had something important she wanted to talk to me about . She sounded scared , Chuck . Yeah , well , so am I. Be careful . - I think we got something . - I 'm coming with you . - No , you 're staying here . - He 's not gonna hurt me . It 's not Professor Chandra we 're worried about . You can 't stop me . Either I go with you , or I follow you , or I go there myself . 14435 Falconer , right ? - Nice . - Well done . Dr Michaels , call 417 . Dr Michaels , call 417 . Hang on a second . And what the fuck is that thing ? This is a model 1871 , legal and registered ... Colt.45 single-action six-shot revolver ... that my granddad bought in Fort Worth ... when he went raiding Pancho Villa in Mexico with the United States Army . Unlike those pussy 9 mm guns you see on TV ... this.45 will knock a man down . I feel better already , Butch . Neil , stay here and keep a good eye with his girl . Yeah . Nice neighbourhood . - Professor ? - Chandra ? Professor ? Professor Chandra has good friends . Yeah , no better friend in the world right now than my dad . It 's just , you don 't wanna get on his bad side , you know ? I 'll try to remember that . Professor ? Five days . Looks like he was planning a long sabbatical . Yeah . Where 's the Professor ? Where 's Neil ? Tessa , is everything okay ? Fuck ! I will shoot you . Where is he ? Let him go . Wait . Are you okay ? Come on . We have to get out . I think I got her . What do you think of my choice of weapons ? Come on . We have to go . We must get out of here . Neil . Neil . Neil ? - Help ! - Neil ! - Neil ? - Get me the fuck out of here ! - Yeah , hang on , hang on , hang on . - Dad ! Dad ! All right . They 're coming . Go . Wait , wait , wait . Where are we gonna find you ? I 'll find you . Pulmonary embolism . It 's a common cause of death for people with her condition . No . I think one of those things you guys saw got her . They can pass for humans . They can be anywhere . - Or anyone . - How do we fight that ? Who 's to say they 're who we 're supposed to be fighting ? - What do you mean ? - Maybe they 're here to save the world . Why would they destroy something they 've been trying so hard to create ? Anyone consider that ? Leave it to you to cloud the issue . These things that Chandra detected on the Internet , these Sentients ... you think they could be responsible for Tessa ? I mean , for any more Tessas out there ? Chandra did say the Sentients are like gods . And gods do have a tendency to create in their own image , don 't they ? Or people have a tendency to create gods in their own image . Now , there you go with that silence again . I 'll get your check . You know , you never answered my question , Chuck . What , am I having an affair ? Oh , Paige ... we 've been married 23 years and if I was fucking around ... you 'd sure as hell know it . Remember when we were stationed at Nellis ? I used to look out my window every 15 minutes ... dreading that I 'd see that black plume of smoke ... knowing that if I did , I 'd never see you again . I feel that way again , Chuck . I just wish I knew why . Let me ask you something , Paige . When we were stationed at Nellis ... and you spent all that time worrying if I 'd crash and burn ... what got you through the day ? Faith . Why don 't you call up a little of that now ? I got us a suite . We can get room service , watch the moon come up over the channel ... and then when we get tired of that , you know ... That sounds great ... except for the " you know . " - What do you mean ? - You 've been having second thoughts . You don 't have to pretend . I can tell . Second thoughts ? No , no , no . No . We can do this . There 's nothing wrong with it . I 've been having second thoughts , too . If we 're really into each other , sex can wait . - Right ? - Right . Okay . How long , in your mind ? I don 't know . Six months ? A year ? We 're only 17 , right ? We 've got all the time in the world . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . All the time in the world . We , as members of a so-called intelligent species ... have a driving compulsion to attach cosmic significance ... to our existence . Simply put , we need to believe that our lives have meaning . Concepts such as free will and self-determination ... are the security blankets we use ... to shield ourselves from the cold , hard truth of reality . And what , may you ask , is this reality ? We are vehicles . Mere vehicles . And behind the wheel of these vehicles are the single-minded impulses ... programmed into our DNA by billions of years of evolutionary struggle . Sorry . We are nothing but a means of conveyance . But it doesn 't mean that from time to time ... we can 't change the direction in which we travel . I now open the floor for questions .

It sure look like a female body to me . Go tell Sano . I will get rid of his stuff in the track and field team within a week . Sano is leaving the track and field team ? Not leaving . He already left . Sano is not here ? Forget about it . Let 's go eat . Okonomiyaki ? I 'm sorry , I don 't feel like eating . Why not ? let 's go ! Let 's go ! Let me go ! No I won 't . Let me go ! Sano left ? Ehm . If that 's what Umeda told you then it must be true . Because he 's track and field team 's consultant . Is that right ? But , that guy Sano .. Why did he drop out ? How can I make him want to jump again ? If you force him to jump then it will never work . Eh ? Actually , he 's the one who wants to jump the most . Seriously . I think you worried about Sano a little bit too much . Uh ? Could it be that you are .. ? HUH ? No ! I 'm not a homo ! I 'M NOT A HOMO ! Idiot ! I 'm just joking ! Don 't take it too seriously . Hey ! What 's wrong with you ? No No No No ! nothing , nothing ! Nothing happened .. Supposely .. Nothing can ever happen ! Mustn 't happen .. mustn 't happen . OK ! Hot ! HOT ! Not again . Hey ! I 'm .. I 'm a hot blooded soccer player , Nakatsu Shuichi ! I only love women ! Sano ! Are you kidding me ? you don 't have any money .. C 'mon now , no point to haggle over a small thing like that . Wait .. Wait a sec ! What .. What .. What .. What 's going on .. ? There .. Sano .. and someone I 've seen it somewhere before .. Eh ? Ah ~ He is Kagurazaka . He competed with Sano in the national competition . What are they talking about ? I need to get a little bit closer . Hey .. It seems to me that you don 't have much muscle left . I 've already left the team . How about join the national competition before quitting ? Huh ? Because your high jump is gonna make the spectators laughs . In fact , you 're afraid . Even though your leg is healed , but you don 't have guts to face the post . What do you know about it ? I know everything . You thought you can end it by drop out of the track and field team . But you don 't know what to do next . So you want to give yourself an excuse , probably that 's who you really are . Isn 't it ? Hey ! You ! You 're full of it ! A guy like you will be number two in million years . Who is this sissy ? What ... I 'm a guy ! Hey ! are you that .. too ? Are .. are you interested in him ? Uh ? Who are you people ? We 're friends . Sano will not lose to a guy like you . Don 't bother .. Sano , I 'm glad for you . You surrounded yourself with such low standard people . What 's wrong with dorm head ? Not sure .. he has been weird since this morning . Now I remember . I wasn 't able to attend in my first year due to car accident . I wasn 't able to attend in my second year because I went to the wrong place . All those bad luck ~ Could it be ~ Because of my beauty ~ That I 'm cursed ! He 's cursed ! Go ask dorm 2 's Kayashima Taiki about what to do . Ask him to help us ! Are you sleeping ? Sano ! Don 't be bothered ! How long are you gonna stay hidden ? When did Yuujiro arrived here ? 1 year ago . He was in the nurse 's office when I pass by .. So I took him in .. 1 year ago .. Ever since .. We always take the same course for a walk . Everyday .. I 'll see this playing-field . But I can only watch .. Nothing else I can do .. Just like what Kagurazaka said . Yuujiro . Without me even knowing .. I am afraid to even stand on the track field . So that 's why you left ? Nah . You don 't have to hurry . You just have to follow your own step and be yourself . How come you just don 't get it ? Eh ? Your words .. are burden to me . I can 't jump . That 's a fact . That 's such a nonsense ! Your leg injury is totally healed . So there 's no way you can 't jump again . You can do it . You are annoying . I already told you I don 't want to jump again . Didn 't I ? You will want to jump again . I will make that day come true So don 't you dare give up . Who do you think you are ? Such a presence . But , I won 't waste my film on you . Hibari is great ! Hibari-sama ! What 's wrong with Oscar ? I asked dorm 2 's Kayashima Taiki to drive the evil away . But the evil stay with me instead ! Oscar ! I 'm Satan .. GET OUT ! I 've failed the first time .. Alright . Coming up next is contest for Mr. Osaka . Contestant No. 1 . Dorm 3 's Himejima Masao-kun ! Don 't call me Masao ! IT HURT ! What is it ? What is it ? That 's weird . Nanba . Sano , Nakatsu and Ashiya are not here yet . Do you think you can still win just like that ? You ! you really don 't know anything . Wait. wait. wat . All of you come over here . Go that way . Go Go If we win and get a LCD TV then we can watch ... Eh ? EH ? ! Really ? ! Not bad uh ? We will both go find them ! Okay . Yes , let 's go ! Sano-sama ! Not there , let 's try over there . Sano ! Tennouji-sama ! Kanna-san ? 1 .. 2 .. 3 .. 4 .. 5 .. 6 .. 7 .. 8 .. 9 .. 10 .. 11 .. That 's great ! Komari ~ Did you find Sano ? No .. Where is he anyway ? Ashiya is missing too . Go over there . I like women .. I like women .. I like women .. A fake medical certificate uh ? You thought by filling in with English .. You can deceive me ? That 's because ... Why did you come here ? Can I tell you a story about a friend ? When my friend was in the junior high . She learned about this high jump athlete . When she saw him jump .. Somehow she was very touched by it . So delicate and graceful .. It 's the most beautiful sight . Therefore , You came here because you are idolizing him ? That 's not it . It 's because his wings has been taken away . One year ago , When I found out he 's in the Japanese training camp in America . I went to visit him in the training camp . But ... There 's a road ahead . Go .. and hurry up . Damn ! So that 's the reason why .. But that didn 't answer my question . You .. What is your friend hope to accomplish by coming here ? That is to .. Make him jump again . Make him jump ? Everyone wants to make this guy jump . But they all failed . What are you gonna do ? I still don 't know right now . I thought if I gathered enough courage to come here .. I can solved everything . But I was wrong . What he has been through is quite dark .. Quite heavy .. So that 's why .. I want to get into his world even more and solve the problem together . Thats what we called a popular " Annoying ! " behaviour in Japan right now . I 've already prepared myself mentally for being hated . However .. If I can 't even face him head on . He definitely won 't jump again . Contestant No. 9 is .. Dorm 2 's Sano Izumi-kun . Sano Izumi-kun . Sano Izumi-kun isn 't here ? Then this will be considered as absence ? Forget it . I give up .. Sano-sama ! Sano-sama ! You 're great ! Here it comes ~ My LCD TV ! Yuujiro ! Yuujiro , let 's go ! Expelled . Eh ? It 's unfortunated but that friend of yours must be expelled . Ashiya . If you came here just to chase after handsome looking guys , I will expelled you from this school right away . But .. I can tell you really want to make him jump again . Let me wait and see . What 's wrong ? You think I am going to eat you up ? No ~ A little ... Relax . I am not interested in women . Eh ? ! Is it ok not to particate in the contest ? Oh no ! All we need now is Ashiya . Ashiya ~ If we can 't make a great impact then it 's gonna be tough ~ I 've got a good idea . Sorry , I am late ~ Heh heh ~ Come , right there . Put that on . Next contestant is No.10. Ashiya Mizuki-kun from Dorm 2 . Go out when the curtain is up . What is going on ? If you go out naked , it will be easier to win first place . All the best ! All the best ! Have confidence in yourself Seriously .. Ashiya ~ Oh my goodness ~ That was really unexpected .. No . That 's the impact we need ! LCD TVs are ours ! Nakatsu , your nose is bleeding . Oh man , I must keep calm . He is a guy . A guy .. a guy .. a gu ... How cute ! You took back the drop request form .. Because his influence .. ? Boys ' division number 1 is ... Yuujiro !

Why do we have to celebrate in this room anyway ? So popular ! I don 't care . Just don 't mess this place up . What did you just say ? Nothing at all . Oh . Sorry . You go ahead . Give me more juice . Why is my heart beating so fast again ? This cup .. belongs to Mizuki .. Which means .. In-in-in-indirect .. kiss ? AH ~ You idiot ! Do you know what you 've done ? ! An aura filled with murderous feel . Everyone 's really hyper . I got dressed up like a woman . How embarrassing . EH ? ! Oh ! he ate the Nara pickles again . It 's true that he 'd kisses anyone . Mizuki . My dear sister , I am here to bring you back to America . - Your brother What 's that ? * Thank You For Watching * Timings : Kai200X / tianj Translator : Kai200X I am bringing you back .

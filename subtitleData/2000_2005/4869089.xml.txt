 Didn 't hardly have to convert the ship even . Six in the corner . Stronger locks , thicker doors , keep everybody where they 're supposed to be . Don 't even need more rations . Hey ! - Wait ! - Come on ! - You made money , huh ? - Hand over fist , my friend . Water plants need labor , terraforming crews got a prodigious death rate . Labor ? You mean slaves . Well , they wasn 't volunteers , for damn sure . That why you didn 't have to lay in more rations ? - I didn 't hear no complaints . - How much money ? Lots ? There 's a chance you might want to head back to the ship . No , I 'm all right . This is entertaining , actually . - Yeah ? Whats entertaining ? - I like watching the game . As with other situations , the key seems to be giving Jayne a heavy stick and standing back . Still , might have to clear out before too much longer . - Seems there 's a thief about . - Thief ? Took this right off him . They earned that with the sweat of their slave-trading brows . - Mal . - Oh , terrible shame . They won 't discover it till they order their next round of drinks . Good drinker , that one . Lovely place . I 'll tell my friends . - Seem to you we clear out in a hurry ? - Seems to me , we do that a lot . Hear tell , though , we 're gonna stay a while on Persephone . - Shiny . - Yeah ? Thought you 'd get land crazy that long in port . - Probably . But I been sane a long while now , and change is good . - Well , ain 't that a joyful sight . - Gotta love a sunset . Lts starting to get familiar , like a second home . Persephone ain 't home . Too many people we need to avoid . Resupply , look for work , move along . - We sniff the air , we don 't kiss the dirt . - Wasn 't planning on the dirt kissing . I wouldn 't stand for it anyway , captain , jealous man like me . - Closing in . - Planets coming up a mite fast . Thats just because I 'm going down too quick . - Likely crash and kill us all . - Well , that happens , let me know . Okay . Whoa . No , we 're good . We 're good . Lts okay . I understand your time on our planet is limited and if you 've selected my proposal to hear then the honor you do me flatters my my honor , and I hope to ... - Now there 's the smile made of sunlight . - Atherton . How wonderful to see you . Did you get my message ? I was extra appealing . Flattering . I had no idea I was arriving in time for the social event of the season . So you 'll accompany me ? I ask , heart in my throat . There 's a certain offer I 'm still waiting to hear about . Yes , I imagine there is . I 'm delighted to say I 'll be there . Now , I 'm sorry , Atherton , I have to run . No , please , I understand . I 'll see you soon . - Good afternoon , captain . - Morning . We 're downing . In case Wash don 't kill us , local time 's gonna be a. m . , 10 or so . Yes , I saw that . Making plans ? " Atherton Wing . " Now he 's a regular , ain 't he ? - I 've seen him before . - I never did . Not what I pictured . Young . - Must be rich to afford your rates . - I suppose . - He has engaged me for several days . - Days ? - Boy must have stamina . - He does . Well . Fine . - Is he letting you out at all ? - We 're attending a ball tomorrow night . Do all the men there pay for their dates , or just young , rich ones with stamina ? Most women will not be companions , if thats what you 're asking . Perhaps the other men couldn 't attract one . It sounds like the finest party I could imagine getting paid to go to . I don 't suppose you 'd find it up to the standards of your outings . More conversation and less petty theft and getting hit with pool cues . I understand if you need to go prepare for that " its 10 in the morning " issue . Yeah , better go do that , because I think this is more of an evening look . Look at the pretties ! What am I looking at ? The girls or the clothes ? - There 's girls ? - The clothes , please . Say , look at the fluffy one . Too much foofaraw . If I were gonna wear a dress I 'd want something with slink . - You want a slinky dress ? I can buy you a slinky dress . Can I have money for a slinky dress ? - I 'll chip in . - I can hurt you . The only place I seen something so nice is some of the things Inara has . - We best be moving . I guess she needs all that stuff . Life she leads . Well , sure . Sometimes the customers buy her things . She knows some real rich men . - These ain 't feathers I 'm toting here . - I like the ruffles . - Inara gets to wear whatever she wants . - What are you gonna do in that rig ? Bounce around the engine room ? Be like a sheep walking on its hind legs . See you on the ship , captain . What , she mad or something ? - Badger . - Capt. Reynolds . Heard you was in town . Thought we might have a bit of a sit-down . Prefer a bit of a piss off . I 'm very sorry , did I give you the impression I was asking ? Seems to me , last time there was a chance for a palaver we were all manner of unwelcome . This ain 't bad . There 's a trick to it . Wood alcohol . Now we 're favored guests . Treated to the finest in beverages that make you blind . - So , what is it you need ? - Excuse me . There 's a local by the name of Warrick Harrow . Got some property he wants to sell off-planet . Fetch a higher price . - The local powers won 't let him . - Lts a conundrum . What my man Harrow needs himself is a smuggler . Willing to cut you in on it . Why me ? You have access to ships . You could do it yourself . He won 't deal with me direct . He 's taken an irrational dislike . What happened , he see your face ? He 's a quality gent . Nose in the air like he never won gwa pee . Don 't find me respectable , but you , I figure , got a chance . You backed out of a deal last time . Left us hanging . - Hurt our feelings . - You recall why that took place ? I had a problem with your attitude , is why . Felt you was , whats the word ? - Pretentious ? - Exactly ! You think you 're better than other people . Just the ones I 'm better than . I 'm thinking that very quality is the one you 're placing value on today . I place value on the fact that stick up your peeku is as large as the one Harrow 's got . - How would you even set up a meet ? The man won 't deal with you . Know a place he 'll be . Safe place using some new-tech gun scans . High-class too . Won 't let me in there . You might slip in . Of course , you couldn 't buy an invite with a diamond the size of a testicle . I got my hands on a couple . Of invites . You want this meeting or not ? Col. Cyrus Mumsen and escort . William and Lady Courtland . Atherton Wing and Inara Serra . Roberta , its been too long . Half the men in this room wish you were on their arm . Only half ? I must be losing my undefinable allure . Oh , its not that undefinable . All of them wish they were in your bed . I 'm looking for the boy with the shimmer one . Oh , she blushes . Not many in your line of work do that . You are a very singular woman . And I find ... I find I admire you more and more . Kaylee ! Kaylee ! Not speaking to you , captain . Got no need to speak . Come on , got a job for you . I 'm trying to offer you something , you know . A life . - If you want it . - Atherton . You can live here on Persephone as my personal companion . You 're a generous man . - That is not a yes . - Lts not a no , either . You look gorgeous , dear . You belong here , Inara . Not on a flying piece of gosa . - You see that , don 't you ? - Atherton , language . What , " piece of gosa " ? But it is a piece of gosa . Miss Kaywinnit Lee Frye and escort . Kaylee ? Oh , gosa . Does ? Does this seem kind of tight ? It shows off your backside . Did you see the chandelier ? Lts hovering . - Whats the point of that , I wonder . - Oh , mangoes . I mean , I see how they did it , I just ain 't getting the why . These girls have the most beautiful dresses . - And so do I , how about that ? - Just be careful . We cheated Badger out of good money to buy that . You 're supposed to make me look respectable . - Yes , sir , Captain Tight Pants . - Okay . I 'm looking for our guy Harrow . And Inara . We should look for her , right ? Just to say hello . If we see her . I think she 's wearing gold . Okay , help me find our man . He 's supposed to be older , stocky wears a red sash crossways . - Why does he do that ? Maybe he won the Miss Persephone pageant . Just help me . Is that him ? Thats the buffet table . Well , how can we be sure unless we question it ? Fine . Don 't make yourself sick . Ante up , gentlemen . Dishes . Dishes . Could do with less of them . Garbage . So I 'll card ... Plum . Plums are tall . I 'll take two . Two . No tall-card claim . - Speaking of garbage , I 'll take three . - Three . Dealer forced to claim the tall . What do you suppose the captain and Kaylee are doing now ? - Septic vac . - Eating steaks off of plates made of solid money , like as anything . I fold . Me too . Tall cards around my neck like a weight . Take it , Shepherd . Thats a nice pile of things I don 't have to do . Lts the ones that take you . The ones reaching and doing it . - River . - Is she hurt ? - Better see to her . - Lts okay . Lts a bad habit for a fugitive . - Calm down . - Do that in public , get herself hauled off . - Everywhere . - Sit down . - Hands go everywhere ... - She didn 't harm much . - We 'll have a few mystery meals . - Because sometimes ... Its okay . Lts okay . Shh . And they come . So we gonna play cards or screw around ? I thought you wanted to spend more time off-ship this visit . Out there , it seems like its all fancy parties . I like our party better . The dress code 's easier , and I know all the steps . I 'd say you do , at that . Oh ... Don 't fall asleep now . Sleepiness is weakness of character . Ask anyone . It is not . You are acting captain . Know what happens , you fall asleep now ? Jayne slits my throat and takes over . - Thats right . - Then we can 't stop it . Well , I wash my hands of it . Lts a hopeless case . I 'll read a nice poem at the funeral . Something with imagery . You could lock the door and keep the power-hungry maniac at bay . Don 't know , I 'm starting to like this poetry idea now . Here lies my beloved Zoe My autumn flower Somewhat less attractive now that She 's all corpsified and gross Oh , no ! Aren 't they something ? They 're like butterflies or little pieces of wrapping paper blowing around . - Hello . - I don 't ... Have we been introduced ? Oh , I 'm Kaylee . Banning . And this is Dester , Cabott and Zoe . Don 't you just love this party ? Everything 's so fancy , and there 's some kind of hot cheese over there . - Lts not as good as last year . - Really ? What did they have last year ? Standards . Who made your dress , Kaylee ? Oh , do you like it ? When I saw the ruffles , I just couldn 't resist . You ought to see to your girl . Your girl , she 's not very good . She made you a dress that looks like you bought it in a store . Oh , I didn 't know ... Why , Banning Miller , what a vision in your fine dress . It mustve take a dozen slaves a dozen days to get you into that getup . Of course , your daddy tells me it takes a schoolboy 's wink to get you out of it again . Forgive my rudeness . I cannot abide useless people . Oh , no . No . Thank you very much . Beg your pardon , but would you be Mr. Warrick Harrow ? - Sir Warrick Harrow . The sash . - The sash ? - It indicates lordhood . - And its doing a great job . Sir , my name 's Malcolm Reynolds . I captain a ship named Serenity . I 've been led to understand you want to move some property off-world . Some property you want to move off-world discreetly . You 're mistaken , sir . I 'm an honest man . There 's nothing dishonest about getting your goods to people what need them . - Whom do you represent ? - Represent isn 't exactly the ... - Don 't waste my time . - Fellow called Badger . I know him , and I think he 's a psychotic lowlife . I think calling him that is an insult to the psychotic lowlife community . - But the deal is solid . - Sorry to interrupt . Sir Warrick , I know you from the club , I believe . Captain , this is Atherton Wing . Atherton , Capt. Mal Reynolds . Pleased to meet you . Inara , I didn 't realize you were going to this party . - Lts the only party . - And I can see why . How about that floating chandelier ? Almost outshines our girl here . Ath ... Can I call you Ath ? Inara has spoken of you to me . She made a point of your generosity . Given that , I 'm sure you won 't mind if I ask Inara the favor of a dance ? Of course . - You 're a brave man . - I know whats mine . This dance I think I actually know . - Why are you here ? - Business , same as you . I was talking to a contact about a job , and you came over . - You were staring at me . - I saw you , is all . You stand out . In this company , I believe you 're the one who stands out . Maybe I just want to see a professional at work . Is this the hardest part , or is that later ? You 've no call to try to make me ashamed of my job . What I do is legal . And how 's that smuggling coming ? - My work 's illegal , but its honest . - What ? While this , the lie of it . That man parading you around on his arm as if he actually won you . As if he loves you . And everyone here going along with it . These people like me and I like them . I like Atherton too , by the way . Well , sure . Whats not to like ? - I 'm liable to sleep with him myself . - He likes me , whether you see it or not . - Of course . - He 's made me an offer . You think he doesn 't honor me , but he wants me to live here . I 'd be his personal companion . I could belong here . Call me pretentious , but there is some appeal in that . You 're right . Got no call to stop you . You 've got the right to a decent life . - I see Kaylee 's here . - Cried Cinderella tears . I told her she could have that layer cake she 's wearing . - I think she looks adorable . - Yeah , but I never said it . I 'm not saying the 80-04 is hard to repair it just ain 't worth it . - Lts a fine machine . Just keep it tuned . - The extenders ain 't braced . - I 've been telling them to buy the 80-10 . Tenders snap off , don 't matter how the engine 's cycling . - I wonder if I could request the honor ... - Wait a minute , let her talk . By the way , the 80-10 's the same machine . They just changed the plating , hoped no one noticed . Lts possible you 're right , this ain 't my kind of party . Whoa , now . Watch yourself . No need for hands on . Excuse me , she 's not here with you , captain . She 's mine . Yours ? She don 't belong to nobody . Money changed hands , which makes her mine tonight . No matter how you dress her up , she 's still ... - So this is my kind of party . - Oh , Mal . What ? The man was out of line . - I accept . - Thats great . What ? - There has been a challenge . - I hope you 're prepared , captain . You all talking about a fight ? Fine . Lets get out of here . - Lts not a fistfight , Mal . - The duel will be tomorrow morning at Kaytree Pond . - Why wait ? Where 's that guard ? - He collected a whole mess of pistols . - If you require it any gentleman here can give you use of a sword . Use of a what ? - Whats going on ? - I 'm not rightly sure . Whats going on ? Well , first , you 'll be put up in lodgings for the night so you don 't disappear . I wouldn 't blame you , incidentally . Wing may be a spoiled dandy , but he 's an expert swordsman . He 's killed a dozen men . You 're the only one gave him a reason . - Oh , this is a joke . - He 'll need a second . - Whats that ? - I 'll take on the job . He fights if you refuse . Inara , come with me , please . Now , you taking on this job being my second , does this mean we 're in business ? It means you 're in mortal danger . But you mussed up Atherton 's face and that has endeared you to me somewhat . You might even give him a fight before he guts you . Inara ! Up until the punching , it was a real nice party . The captain 's gone and got himself in trouble . - A duel ? - With swords ? The captain 's a good fighter . He must know how to handle a sword . I think he knows which end to hold . So we just need to figure out how to get him out of there . We have until the morning , correct ? Do you know what lodging he 's in ? Oh . This is embarrassing . Some of you seem to be misapprehending my purpose in being here . You 're here to make sure that we don 't do what these men are keen on doing . Penny for the smart lady . Persephone 's my home . I got to do business with the people here . I don 't want it known I brought someone in , caused this kind of ruckus . We 'll just settle in till this blows over , one way or the other . - Jayne , I wouldn 't . - Why not ? Hi . - Mal . - Whoa ! What are you doing here ? Atherton 's a heavy sleeper night before a big day . Killing you in the morning , then a haircut later . Such a comfort , having friends visit at a time like this . I knew the accommodations would be nice . Atherton doesn 't skimp . I don 't suppose I like being kept by him as much as others do . - How come you 're still attached to him ? - Because its my decision , not yours . Thought he made it pretty clear he 's got no regard for you . You did manage to push him into saying something . It made a nice justification for the punch . He insulted you , I hit him . Seemed like the thing to do . - Why 'd this get so complicated ? - Well , its about to get simpler . There 's a back door . The desk clerk is on alert . - He 'll let us out . - I 'm not running off . I didn 't do this to prove some kind of point to you . I thought I was defending your honor , and I never back down from a fight . - Yes , you do . You do all the time . - Well , yeah . But I 'm not backing down from this one . He 's an expert swordsman , Mal . You had trouble with the pillar . - How will your death help my honor ? - Well , I plan on having it be his death . Thats why I need lessons . I figure you know how , being such an educated woman and all . He said not to do anything . - He 'll join us after he wins the duel . - Yeah , what if he don 't win ? It doesn 't hurt to have a contingency plan , Kaylee . I 'm thinking , since we 're unarmed , we should take them by surprise . - All at once . - Not necessarily . We can lure one or two of them away . Say , infirmary ? Take them out , be on Badger before he knows what happens . Yeah , only if his attention is elsewhere . What we need is a diversion . - I say Zoe gets naked . - Nope . - I could get naked . - No ! River , you can 't be here . No , come on . - River ! River , please . - Who 's that there ? Yeah , look at me . Whats your story , love ? She 's just a passenger . Yeah ? Why ain 't she talking ? She got a secret ? - No , I ... - Sure . I got a secret . More than one . Don 't seem likely I 'd tell them to you , now , do it ? Anyone off Dayton Colony knows better than to talk to strangers . You 're talking loud enough for the both of us , though , ain 't you ? I 've known a dozen like you . Skipped off home early . Minor graft jobs here and there . Spent some time in the lock-down , but less than you claim . Now you 're what ? Petty thief with delusions of standing ? Sad little king of a sad little hill . Nice to see someone from the old homestead . Not really . Call me if anyone interesting shows up . I like her . That there , exactly the kind of diversion we coulïve used . Attack . How did I avoid that ? - By being fast like a freak . - No . Because you always attack the same way . Swinging from the shoulder like you 're chopping wood . Thrust with the point sometimes or swing from the elbow . - From the shoulder feels stronger . - Lts also slower , Mal . You don 't need strength as much as speed . We 're fragile creatures . It takes less than a pound of pressure to cut skin . You know that ? They teach you that in whore academy ? You have a strange sense of nobility , captain . Lay a man out for implying I 'm a whore , but you keep calling me one to my face . I might not respect your job , but he didn 't respect you . Thats the difference . Inara , he doesn 't even see you . Well , I guess death will solve the issue to everyone 's satisfaction . This duel is the result of the rules of your society , not mine . You are always breaking the rules , no matter what society you 're in . You don 't get along with criminals either , so you constantly get in trouble . You think following rules will buy you a nice life , even if they make you a slave . Don 't take his offer . - What ? - Don 't do it . In case it happens , it means he 's the fellow who killed me and I don 't like fellows who kill me , not in general . I said before that I didn 't have call to stop you , and thats true . Anyways , don 't . I need to get back . He 'll be up early . Right . He 's got that big day . Best be careful , Ath . I hear these things are sharp . - He thinks he 's doing well , doesn 't he ? - He 's being toyed with . - Whats he doing ? - Don 't fall for that ! Well , this isn 't going to take long , is it ? We 're coming up on the end , miss . You might not want to watch . Atherton ! Wait . I 'll stay here , exclusive to you . Just let him live . He 's down . You have to finish it , lad . You have to finish it . For a man to lay beaten and yet breathing it makes him a coward ! - Lts humiliation . Sure . It would be humiliating . Having to lie there while the better man refuses to spill your blood . Mercy is the mark of a great man . Guess I 'm just a good man . Well , I 'm all right . Inara . Inara ! You 've lost her , lad . Be gracious . You set this up , whore . After I bought and paid for you . I shoulïve uglied you up so no one else would want you . See how I 'm not punching him ? I think I 've grown . Well , get ready to starve . I 'll see to it you never work again . Actually , thats not how it works . You 've earned yourself a black mark in the client registry . No companion is going to contract with you ever again . You 'll have to rely on your winning personality to get women . God help you . - You didn 't have to wound that man . - Yeah , I know . It was just funny . You willing to fight that hard to protect my property I 'll have it in your hold before midnight . Mighty fine shindig . Doc 's filling the Shepherd in on the plan . We 're ready to move on your signal . Doc is the diversion . Did you ever see such a lazy crew ? - Captain ! - You 're hurt . - You get us a deal ? - I got a deal . - Now get off my ship . - Ta very much for a lovely night , then . - Ow . - Are you badly hurt ? Oh ... We was just about to spring into action , captain . - Complicated escape and rescue op . - I was gonna watch . It was very exciting . Thank you for the wine . Lts very fresh . To Kaylee and her inter-engine fermentation system . - Are you in pain ? - Absolutely . - I got stabbed , you know , right here . - I saw . I don 't care much for fancy parties . Too rough . - It wasn 't entirely a disaster . - I got stabbed right here . You also lined up exciting new crime . Lts good to have cargo . Makes us a target for every other scavenger out there , of course but sometimes , thats fun too . I am grateful , you know , for the ill-conceived and highhanded attempt to defend my honor , although I didn 't want you to . Gracious as that is , as I look back I shoulïve stayed out of your world . My world ? If it is that . I wasn 't gonna stay , you know . Yeah ? Why is that ? Someone needs to keep Kaylee out of trouble . And all my things are here . Besides , why would I want to leave Serenity ? Can 't think of a reason .

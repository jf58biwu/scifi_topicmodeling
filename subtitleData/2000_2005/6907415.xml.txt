Middle-schoolers want to act grown up . That 's why Field Day is called an Athletic Festival , and Literary Fest is called a Cultural Festival . Right , right . Dad says " Good Luck !

It 's sure to be a great day for the Athletic Festival . First year students , this is the Misumaru Middle School Athletic Festival . I 'm sure this will be a good opportunity to get to know your new classmates even more . I guess the same goes for those second year students who 've recently had homeroom reassignments . And , for the third year students , as this will be your last Athletic Festival ... One of the two big events at Misumaru Middle School , ... I hope that it will be a great and memorable experience . One of the two big events at Misumaru Middle School , ... I hope that it will be a great and memorable experience . ... I hope that it will be a great and memorable experience . the Athletic Festival , is here ! the Athletic Festival , is here ! The Athletic Festival is held in June , and the Culture Festival is held in November . There were differing opinions on whether or not to hold the Athletic Festival during the rainy season , but well , I think it 's best to consider it a festive boost before final exams . Well , that 's all from the belligerent teachers . The rest will be where you get to show off your thinking skills and strength ! Show us what you can do , and good luck ! We 'll now continue with the student president 's opening comments for the festival . Ready ... Do I ... really have to wear this ? Of course you do ! I 've never heard of a Cheer Team Captain wearing a phys-ed uniform . I have . Well too bad ! The White Cheer Team has Muryou for their captain . We have to be flashy and stand out too ! Y-You ! What do you think you 're doing ? Hey . That 's amazing , Kyoichi . Shut up ! This is all your fault ! I 'm amazed that you can wear something so embarrassing ! Huh ? Oh , this ? I 've been getting a lot of compliments on it ... Muryou . Forgive us ! We 're the ones who recommended you to become the Cheer Team Captain , but you 're on the white team , and we 're on the red team . Fate has its evil ways ... But , we 're on your side ! It doesn 't matter which side we 're on ! Oh yes it does ! Muryou Subaru ! What do you think you 're doing , slacking off ? You 're supposed to be over here ! What are you doing hanging out on enemy ground ? Oh . Sorry . Well , guys . Let 's fight fair and square . Bye . Moriyama 's gonna be in the cheer competition , too ... The team that wins gets a fifty-point bonus . The audience gets to vote for whichever cheer they like , so ... This is bad ! Are you saying I 'm not good enough ? Yes ! Mineo ! This is where you come in ! Go ! You 've got it ! You can do it ! Go ! You 've got it ! RED You can do it ! Go ! You 've got it ! RED One , two ! One , two ! One , two ! One , two ! One , two ! One , two ! One , two ! One , two ! Hey , hello . About that Zaiglian from the other day ... Splish Splash Water It looks like he really was a spy . We found Empire ships hiding in the orbit of Mars . Planet Zaigle was the most recent planet to join the Galactic Federation , but they split in two , and they 're in the middle of a war . The thing is , they 're the same as earth . Their people have short life spans . It seems like most of the people who knew about the Galactic Federation died as they were fighting . Then , why did they come to Earth ? I 'm sure the old bigwigs still know the truth . That 's why they want to get what 's here on Earth . White Team Cheer Captain , Muryou Subaru and Red Team Cheer Captain , Kyoichi Moriguchi , are both making their entrance ! The cheer competition this afternoon will revolve around these two . Both teams will be doing their cheer routine for the cheer competition ! Everyone in the audience , and those just stopping by please place your votes when the time comes ! That 's the boy who came down from the mountains ? He looks like an interesting kid . The people from the Sanemori family seem to be curious , too . They 're here to spy on him . You have aliens coming from the outside , and a mysterious boy showing up inside . You guys 've got a lot going on . R-E-D ! R-E-D ! Red ! Red ! Covered in Red ! Fight ! Fight ! White ! White ! Covered in White ! The second year boys and girls are competing in the face powder race ! Don 't lose your concentration ! Ok ! Don 't lose your concentration ! Ok ! Everyone , do your best to powder up your face ! Whoa . It 's crowded ! It 's because the race after next is the millipede relay race . Then I 'm gonna go wash over there . I 'm in the relay race , so ... Good luck . Hajime ! Gotcha ! Idiot lord ! Idiot lord ! I 'm gonna get you for that ! Red 's moving fast ! Red 's moving fast ! It 's the Red Team volunteer , Mr. Aloha ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Goal ! Excuse me , son . Yes ? Are you Hajime Murata ? Yes ... Did you see the stars ? Stars ? You 're ... ? I am Jyuuzen Tsumori the grandfather of student body president Hachio Tsumori . I am Sai Moriyama , Nayuta 's father . Seems like my daughter is always with you . Huh ? Moriyama 's father ? What did you think about the history of the stars ? About Lady Momoe 's incantation ? Umm ... It was like a huge amount of information was poured into my head ... I 'm still trying to sort it out . Muryou said that that 's okay , but ... Muryou ? Oh , the child that came from Asougi 's place . So , how did you feel ? How ? Yes . Tell me what you felt . It was beautiful . Beautiful ? Cool , warm and pleasant . That 's what it felt like . It was like lying flat on your stomach on the cold floor on a hot summer day . That kind of feeling . A summer ... ? On the floor ? I 'm sorry . That 's the only way I can explain it . Hajime Murata , second year homeroom C ! Excuse me . Thank you . Did you hear that ? Yes . What Lady Momoe said before she mightjust be right . What were you talking about with my father ? He told me to look after his daughter . Idiot . The spy from Planet Zaigle had the same images poured into his head , and he committed suicide . But on the other hand , that boy from Earth ... Perhaps times have changed ? What ? You want me in the three-person four-legged race ? You want me in it too ? That 's right . I want you , Muryou and Nayuta , the three of you , to enter the race ! But , isn 't that race mostly run by third year students ? Look at the scores . WHITE TEAM RED TEAM WHITE TEAM RED TEAM The scores are too close ! We can 't predict what 's going to happen . We can 't lose against them ! If we have a chance of scoring in a race , we should grab as many points as we can ! I see ... Just as we said that , an amazing person showed up , who told us about how amazing your teamwork ability is . Huh ? Hi ! Setsuna ... Do you have something against us ? Oh why not , Nayuta ? You 'll have your arms full . Doesn 't that make you happy ? Hi ! " Have your arms full ? " What ? Hey ! Stop it ! Please Stand By Please Stand By The White Team seems to be having a quarrel already ! Moriyama 's daughter seems to be really taken . She 's just a kid . She may be able to command the Shingu , but in front of a good looking guy ... Speaking of good looking guys , I think our Kyoichi is quite handsome . Of course he is ! He 's our son ! Stupid parents , stupid parents . And that was the Millipede Relay Race ! Good work to everyone who participated ! Our son has such a good voice . You 're a stupid parent too . A Zaiglian ? I 'm positive . He 's mingling in the crowd . But he died , right before my eyes . Presumably , the main troops have started to make their move after receiving the dead spy 's report . How many ? At least three . So , Ms. Isozaki , I 'll ask you to please help out the students , then . Okay , sure . But I 'm sorry that you have to do this . No , this is my job . This is for future diplomacy ... Record of the School Wars : MURYOU THE AFTERNOON PROGRAMS WILL BEGIN AT NOON . Athletic Festival Representatives Committee Hajime 's mom always makes the tastiest stuff ! I 'll trade you my fried egg for a croquette . Thanks . I wonder what they 're going to be doing for the cheer competition right after lunch ? Moriyama had pom-poms , so ... I think she might be a cheerleader . Nayuta Moriyama as a cheerleader ! ? Hold that grin and say cheese ! Gotcha , grin-face ! Hey , where 's mom ? She 's here , right ? She 's at the bench . She 's with Setsuna . Are you sure you don 't want to eat with Hajime ? Yes . I think it 's more fun for him to eat with his friends on Field Day . You 're right . And these ohagi are delicious . Did you make them ? Oh , no . Momoe ... the grandmother from the Sanemori family made these . Eating is my specialty . My brother seems to be having fun , too . I was really worried about sending him here by himself , but now I feel much better about it . Isn 't Tenmo great ? Yes . Everyone is so nice . And such hard workers , too . Ah ! You started eating without me ! Oh . Don 't worry . There 's still more . Come here everyone ! Collecting data on female students ? What a perverted spy . I want to meet your superior ! Bravo ! Bravo ! But was it all right to do that to your witness ? That was a puppet . It wouldn 't have been a witness . Collecting information via remote manipulation . If something happens , self-destruct and take the enemy down with you . Impressive how well it 's made . Do you need something ? If you 're here to watch , please go to the athletic field . Fine , fine . She 's so scary . Ms. Isozaki . Are you all right ? The enemy was a spy robot . It was here to reconfirm the data that was sent before , and to collect new information ... So it seems ! Sheesh ... Everyone 's roaming around as they please . You 're going to be helping us , then . Sure , sure . Mr. Yamamoto ! Now , now ... Today is the Athletic Festival . Bothering the students is the last thing I want to do . Yup . Yup . Canceling the Athletic Festival because of aliens would be pretty lame . I understand .

I wonder what they 're going to do ? Now , here comes the White Cheer Team ! White Team 's Cheer Gotcha ! Alley oop ! I 'll do it . I 'm glad he was away from the school . Jiltosh ! Would you act more serious and do something ? But don 't you think you two are enough ? You guys are strong . Geez . Why 'd I have to follow them ? There 's a lot going on right now with the White Team cheer ! The Red ... they 're idiots ! Isn 't that against the rules ? Yeah , yeah ... I understand . You should be able to decipher where the Zaiglian doing the remote manipulation is hiding . Come on , don 't treat me like a homing device . The repair bill you got from that Zaiglian messing up the pub ... I can make it so you don 't have to pay ... How about it ? Right ! I 'm on the case !

We won the Cheer Competition by a landslide thanks to you . Everyone 's happy . Thank you . I don 't deserve such words . Our duty is to serve Master Kyoichi from the Moriguchi family ... Why do you have to be like this now ? Why are you so subservient ? Fine . Then I order you , in the name of the Moriguchi family ! Harumi . Yes . Let 's do our best in the Athletic Festival . Okay . Sounds like they have some issues , but it 's hard to be serious when the guy 's dressed like that . So , thanks to Kyoichi Moriguchi 's self-sacrificing plan , the Red Team won the Cheer Competition by a landslide . With that as encouragement , the Red Team moved on to widen the score gap between themselves and the white team .

RED TEAM RED vs. WHITE CAVALRY BATTLE What an amazingly close battle ! Such an unexpected close match ! Who could have predicted it would turn like out like this ? The Red Team is in the lead , but only by a slim margin ! It 's obvious that this cavalry battle will determine the winner ! Which team will be victorious ?

 Go . Go ! Oh , um , hi . Uh , my name is Mary O 'Reilly O 'Toole O 'Shea , and , uh ... Don 't be nervous . Somewhere out there is the island my friend Muffy owns . It 's spring break ... and she 's invited us over there for the weekend . - And ... - Uh-huh . We 're waiting for the ferry now to take us there , and ... I don 't know what else to say . Well , why don 't you tell us something about yourself ? Oh , all right . Something about myself . Yeah . I want to work with handicapped children . And my parents are my best friends . Oh , and I start convent school next semester ... and I fuck on the first date . April Fool 's . Well , Nikki , baby , you 're outrageous ! Ha , now get out of here , you knucklehead . All right . Uh , Kit . Kit , how about you ? - Uh , pass . - Uh , Arch , Skip , where are you ? - Yeah , yeah . Uh , yeah . - Come on . Help me out . Yeah , sure . Uh-huh . I fuck on the first date . Didn 't we ? We did . On the first date . - Didn 't we , honey ? He 's an animal . - Get off of me . Oh , shit ! Need any help down there ? No . Clara , thanks . I 'm just trying some last minute straightening up . God , I don 't think I 've worked so hard in my life . - Ow . - Sure you don 't want me to stay ? There 'll be nobody to help till the first ferry back Monday , you know . No . Clara , you 're a peach . This one 's mine . I told my father I 'd do it , and I will , my way . We don 't want him to have any excuses . All right then . Have a nice party . Nice ? It 's gonna be better than nice . It 's gonna be bloody unforgettable . Good luck . Here comes the ferry . - Come on . - I call shotgun . - Is this the St. John house ferry ? - Yeah , any second now . Oh , thank goodness . I didn 't know if I was on the right road or not . Here , let me help you . Kit Graham . - Nan Youngblood . - Hi , and that 's Nikki Brashears . Are you planning on staying a while ? Um , no , it 's just some ... Some work for finals when we get back . - I 'm so far behind . - Hi , how 's it going ? - I got it . Hi . Arch Cummings . - Hi . Nan . - I 've seen you around . Jewett Hall ? - Yeah . Chaz Vyshinsky . You 've got great legs . Chaz , now that she already has her bags ... I only met Muffy this term in Drama Society . I volunteered to do their costumes . I like to sew . - Did you see her in Ghosts ? - No . Oh , she was wonderful . She 's so talented . Yeah , she is . Guy , your fly is open ... and your Hostess Twinkie is hanging out . Huh ? Come on if you 're coming . Um , excuse me , sir , but we 're still waiting for someone ... This is Friday ... my last run of the week . I don 't get overtime . But you have to wait because this is the only way over ... and if he misses this one , then how is he sup ... Wait up ! Go , go , go , go ! Sorry , guys . Nik , Chaz , hi . - Rob Ferris . Hi . - Hi . Whoa ! Hi , Harvey Hal Edison , Jr . But call me Hal . Only my folks call me Harve , and I can 't stand it . Uh , sure is a pretty spot here , isn 't it ? You 're friends with Muffy St. John ? Sure am . We sit together in Econ 345 . I let her copy my marginal utility curves . Oh , I get it . That 's a joke ! - Harve ... - Hal ! Springsteen ! Still the Boss ! Okay , let 's go . We don 't have all day . You all , uh , buddies ? Except for Skip and Nan . They only just met . But we will be . Careful what you say to him , though . He 's Muffy 's cousin . - Oh , no kidding ! - Distant . Over the horizon . Otherwise , I wouldn 't have been invited . Old money never mixes family with friends . This is true , for as long as I 've known her . Or to protect her family , I guess . No , to keep her friends . Choose your weapons , big guy . - Hey , hey , what 's this ? - You up for a game of stretch ? - Okay . - Skip , your fly is open . Eat it . Ah , Rob . Your fly is open . Okay , don 't believe me . Oh , nice . We 're off . Bye . First round , the champ ! You know what I find amazing ? Muffy 's her real name . I mean , my name 's Harvey , but they call me Hal . So I figured Muffy must stand for something ... Muffin ? Muff-child , Moffo , the Muffster , Muff 'n ' stuff . Muff dive . Hi , what are you reading ? Uh , Milton 's Paradise Lost . For Professor Russo 's course in English epic . - Hmm . - You know , it 's a shame . - It 's a dying form . - Dying . Not too many people read it nowadays , even in college . Really ? What about you ? Oh , treasure island , the history of pornography in America . Kit , I 'm a state university boy . I don 't have the perks like some of you private college kids do . Don 't give me that . First , I 'm hoping to interview with her daddy 's company ... southern regional sales , next year before graduation . You know , he 's worth more than 50 million over the counter . But I don 't think that 's why she invited me , do you ? I mean , my God , we 're not going to be sheltered ... little college kids our whole life . Wake up . Smell the bacon , Nan . It 's research that I can do all on my own . And this is the best part . I never get tired of it . You wanna take a look ? Bruce 's car was in the shop . - I mean , it was really ... - But that 's not my point . Fuck ! Oh , my God ! We 're gonna spend a weekend there ? What are you , a fucking wimp ? Hey , I 'm really not that interested anymore . Come on , man . Just one more ! Double or nothing ! Here . Enough 's enough . - Oh , what ? What are you , scared ? - Hey , I said give it a rest ! Oh , fuck ! I 'll get him . I 'll get him . - Where is he , guys ? - Where is he ? What you looking for ? We got ' em ! Oh , yeah , did we nail ' em ! Ha , ha , ha . April Fool 's . Very funny . What 's wrong with you ? Somebody could have gotten hurt out there . Oh , at least we don 't go for " this shoelace is untied " crap . You know that . Oh , great ! Shit ! Okay , Buck . Come on out of there . Come on . I 'm gonna need some help up here . No , no . I 'll just do it from here . Throw me the line . - This one ? - That 's the one . That 'll work . Thank you . Some hero you turned out to be . I took off my jacket and shoes . What do you want from me ? There were three guys in the water . - I 'm only kidding . - Nikki , can we borrow your towel ? Yeah . You guys got to admit it was a hell of a trick . - I loved it . - Unforgettable . Buck , look out ! - Oh , shit ! - Call a medic ! Calm him down ! - We gotta get him to a doctor ! - Cal ! - Cal ! - The boat ! The boat ! Calm him down ! They did it ! They did it ! What 's going on ? Sam , what happened ? Tricks . Pranks . Ask your friends . - Is your dad around ? - No , he 's in Sutton Place . Why ? You haven 't heard from him or anyone else ? Uh , look . I 'm gonna have to borrow your boat to get back to shore . We keep all the keys on a board in the kitchen . But I think there 's an extra one underneath the cushion there . Look , you people . Stay put , all of you . If anything else happens or if anything happens to Buck ... I wanna know where to find you . Skip , it 's not your fault . It was an accident . You didn 't know . Sure . Did you see his face ? Muffy . Nothing bad ever happens to her . Well , there 's an awful lot to be done with this place . - You sound as if you own it . - I will . If all goes well , next month , when I turn 2 1 ... it 's my first stage of inheritance . First stage ? What 's your second ? Taxes . You may be talking to your future boss , Harve . Nikki ... burn my bags , baby . I am home ! Oh , yeah ! I could get really used to this . We used to spend all our summers here before my mother died . This is a very special place to me . It 's like a dream . On a clear day , you can see the Kennedys . Wow ! You guys , look at this . Oh , Muffers ! Our very own place settings ... with our very own place cards ... and a his and her little dolly ! - It 's just like in Agatha Christie . - And sporks ! - " Sporks " ? - And napkins with bunnies on ' em . Gee , Muff , you really spared no expense . Well , now how do you think Daddy made his money ? The old-fashioned way ... he inherited it . I used to have all of her outfits . Hold it ! Now don 't anybody move ... but before this night is over , somebody in this room ... will pull his wang . " My first experience was , ' A , ' painful and degrading ... " ' B , ' not so hot , but I really cared about him ... " ' C , ' I was ready to try again ... or ' D , ' wildly exciting ... I had an orgasm . " " A " and part of " B. " " Painful and degrading , " " Not so hot , but I really cared about him . " Aw , that 's so sweet ! I 'll take " B. " " Not so hot , but I really cared about him . " Was it Rob ? Uh , no , it wasn 't Rob . Uh , what about you , Nikki ? Um , " A " and " D " ... " Painful and degrading , " " Wildly exciting ... I had an orgasm . " What can I say ? Uh ... Anyway , " The one thing I haven 't tried yet ... " ' A , ' oral sex ... " ' B , ' anal entry ... " ' C , ' S and M , ' D , ' group sex ... 'E , ' lesbian sex or ' F , ' all of the above . " What was " C " ? Hi , my name is Mary O 'Toole O 'Reilly O 'Shea ... and I want to go to convent school and things like that . Welcome . Welcome to my home ... and lifestyles of the rich and undeserving . Uh , my name is Arch Cummings , and I 'm on a mission here . I 'm on a mission to bed as many women as humanly possible . Nan 's out , to be honest . Uh , she likes the theater ... She 's out of first round draft choices , if you know what I mean . Poor boy can say , " Fuck you , Dad . I 'm my own person . " What 's his father gonna do , kick him out of the house ? Disinherit him ? His life won 't have changed much . He 's got nothing to lose . His father 's love . That was lost a long , long time ago . Skip , blaming yourself won 't make Buck any better . - Hi . - Hi . - Ta-da ! - Boy , Muffy , you sure know ... how to make a guy look forward to dessert . Please , God , let it be Ding-Dongs . St. John hospitality taken to the extreme . I think it 's real friendly . Makes me feel right at home . How are we gonna feel after these beans ? You guys ! Care for some beans ? I wonder how Buck 's doing . - Should call or something ? - I 'll call later . I 'm sure he 's getting the best medical care available , right ? You guys , let 's change the subject . Well , uh ... Harve 's got his job interview all figured out . What about the rest of us ? Does anyone know ... what they 're gonna be doing after graduation ? - Good choice , Arch . - This is incredible . Here we are , privileged , independent ... the hope for the future right at this table . None of us knows what we 're gonna do with the rest of our lives . - Rob knows . - Kit , come on . Rob is going to medical school . No shit . You got early acceptance ? We can talk about this at some other time . Why ? You already had the meeting with your counselor . Kit , I don 't think he wants to talk about it in front of everybody . - No , no , I don 't mind . - We 're all friends here , right ? Sort of . He said to forget it . He said that my grades might be okay ... but , well , basically , I possess an essential lack of seriousness . And that 's what they look for . Him too ? That 's what my guy said . I said , " You gotta be kidding . " I mean , how can anyone be serious about anything ... " when some moron can steal a bomb or push a button ... and nuke us all until our shadows glow ? " He wasn 't impressed with that , but ... Oh , what 's this ? Dom Perignon sparkling rose ? Smells like Ripple . You have outdone yourself again , St. John . Can I make a toast ? Well ... someone once said to me ... to cherish the friends you make in college . I try to cherish all the friends I make . - Stop it ! - Because ... they 'll be the friends you cherish most for the rest of your life . So , well , here 's to us . And here 's to my life ... because I 'm very glad to be here ... and to be a part of all of you . Muffy , anything you want to add to that ? Why me ? Because you 're the hostess . Okay . In his Life ofJohnson ... James Boswell said ... " We cannot predict the precise moment when friendships are formed . " As in filling a vessel , drop by drop ... there is at last one which makes it run over . " " So , in a series ... " " So , in a series of kindnesses ... " there is at last one ... which makes the heart run over . " So , with his toast ... may our hearts run over and our friendships be formed . " - All right . - Oh , cheers ! - Cheers ! - Going down . - Oh , my God ! - Oh , no ! April fool . Wow , what is this , the bridal suite ? You like it ? I thought you needed the room . I 'll find a use for it . Um , I know you and Arch had something going before I met him . Arch is sweet , but he only has two expressions ... collar up and collar down . Yeah , I found that out . Um , guess what I 'm trying to say now is ... Um , well , you always seem to get there first ... but this time Chaz is mine , okay ? What about Hal ? Harvey ? Mr. Junior Achievement ? Oh , please ! Yuck ! Don 't try to tell me you hadn 't thought of me in that way , Muffy . Why , I felt the spark between us ... the very first time we ever laid eyes on each other . In Econ 345 . Why , just think of it , Muffy . With my talent ... and your ... money ... All right , ladies . We 're gonna have some privacy . You gotta be kidding . Unless Muffy knows something about us we don 't . Hold me , big fella . Hold me ! Just holster it , cowboy , will ya ? Let 's play hide the sausage . Giddyap ! - Oh , hold me like a man , General ! - Stop it ! Why , just think of it , Muffers . With my raw , drivin ' talent ... and your , uh ... And your ... Wrong room . Shit . Aw , come on . Are you still angry with me ? About dinner ? No . I 'm sorry . I 'm not angry at you . I 'm just angry . Ow ! Jesus ! Very funny . Boo ! Muffy . Arch . - Hi , Muff . Hi . - Ah , ah , hmm . Um , do you know what time it is , love ? - Mm-hmm ! - Oh , my God ! Good night . Wait . Real funny , you guys ! Better ride than you can give me ! Hello ? Shit . Who 's there ? Fuck ! Jesus Christ ! Fuckin ' cat . Oh , God . Mornin ' . I was having a nightmare about Buck , and I don 't know what to ... Good morning . I was just hungry . I must look a mess . - Oh ! - Good morning , Muff . I forgot to get dressed . - So who made her night ? - I don 't know . - Where 's Skip ? - That depends what he 's on . - You guys have gotta be kidding . - Bye-bye . Hey , Nan . Nan , what about it ? Come on . No , thanks . Besides , I thought I 'd wait to see what Muffy wanted to do . Chaz , calm down ! - Whoa ! - He comes down with it ! - I got it ! - No , that 's my bad knee ! I got it ! I got Nikki , you get the ball . I 've got her . She 's covered . Good one , Harve ! Good one , Harve ! Behind ya , baby ! Hey , Rob . What 's wrong ? I 'm just thinking ... about that meeting I had with my adviser . I feel like I 'm going nowhere . He always said you weren 't serious enough . Kit , maybe it 's crazy you investing so much energy in me . Oh , yeah , sure . You feel this way about me now . What about a year from now when I 'm a TV repairman . All those other guys up there are ... - You 're right . - I know . I told you . I 'm right . - You 're right . - I know . I 'm right . I said I 'm right . - There 's no question . - I 'm right . You 're a jerk . Huh ! God . I am . Wait a minute . Come here , baby . Skip , you son of a bitch ! Respectable young Quaker couple ... returning from quiet afternoon of nonviolent sex . So how was it ? Where 's Skip ? Has anybody seen him ? - Who wants to know ? - Goddamn it ! Can 't you just give me a straight answer ? We just saw him down at the boathouse , drifting by on a boat . And he wasn 't moving . He looked dead , unless he was joking ... - Well , if it was Skip ... - I saw his face , Chaz ! Look . Has anybody seen him since last night ? Jesus Christ ! We 'll look for him . I 'll go with you . I 'm coming too . What 's happening ? Is something wrong ? Skip ? Hey , asshole ! - Hey , Skip ! - Hey , wait a minute . Look at this . Skip 's knife . Think it was that guy on the ferry ? I don 't know . Man , I don 't know what to think . I say we go looking for him . Him or Skip . One of 'em has gotta be around here . - You mean split up ? - Let 's not ... No sucker 's taking me in . I know why you 're avoiding me . I guess it 's your idea of a joke . That 's why you invited me here , isn 't it ? Isn 't it ? How did you find out , from one of your preppy friends ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . Oh . You mean the tape just got there , just appeared ? You know , I thought you wanted to be friends . Any sign of Skip ? No luck here . - Well , where 's Arch ? - He was with you ! Shit ! That 's it . I don 't like this . I definitely don 't think I like this . It 's time to call the police . 8248 . Constable Potter has an office at his home . - Come on . - Who wants tea ? It 'll relax the nerves . Is she kidding ? I didn 't know what kind anybody would like ... so I brought them all . Well , here , let me help you . I 'll get you some water . Has he reached the constable ? We haven 't been able to get through to the mainland yet . - Oh ! - Oh , the main . - It 's probably broken . - There 's no water ? - What 's happening ? - There 's no water ! - What ? - It happens sometimes . But there 's still the well . Jesus , I 'll go . Just point me in the right direction . Uh , not without me . I 'm not worried about those two ... Skip and Art . They 're probably playing some kind of stupid trick . Yeah . Probably . Is that it ? Boy , when she said well , she really meant well . Who dug this thing , Pocahontas ? Oh , here . Let me do that . I probably have more experience than you . You mean back home on the farm ? I know you think I 'm a hick . I 'd like to change your mind about that if you 'd give me a chance . Why ? Because I would really like to plow your field . Draw me some water . - What happened ? - I lost the bucket . Harve . Hal ! And the rope was rotten . Any fool could have seen that . You didn 't . Would you shine your light down there so I can get a fix on it ? - Oh ! - Nice going . Okay , so I spazzed out . Now we 're even . Uh-huh , and what do we do now ? Well , look . There are little rungs leading down the side . So ? - So you 'd better get a move on . - Are you crazy ? I don 't relish spending the rest of the weekend without water . Well , I 'm not going down there . - Okay , fine . - Whoa , whoa ! - Wait a minute . What are you doing ? - What 's it look like ? Well , I don 't think you ought to do that . Uh , Nikki ? Nik ... Harvey , I 'm a big girl now . I think I can handle a few spiders and frogs . Just be careful down there , all right ? - Watch what you 're doing . - Watch what I 'm doing . That 's a hot one . I can barely see a thing . Well , just watch out anyway , okay ? Just be careful . Nikki ? Nikki ! Hey , answer me ! I 'm fine , I 'm fine . Help ! Uh , Nikki ! Nikki ! Help ! Answer me ! Uh , help ! Rob ! Kit ! Help ! Nikki , damn it ! Answer me ! Nikki ! Nikki ! Shit ! Oh , my God ! Come on ! Grab my hand ! Nikki ! Nikki ! Come on . Come on ! Come on ! Reach ! Damn it , come on ! Come on ! Come here ! Come on ! It 's okay now . With the others , they were outside . But , you see , we 're inside , so we 're safe now . It 's all because of what happened at the ferry , isn 't it ? It was an accident . Christ , don 't they know that ? Uh , Muffy , where do you keep your guns ? Guns ? We don 't keep guns in this house . - Here . - God , not the water ! It 's all right . It 's Perrier . Here . Hello ? Oh , Constable Potter . Listen , man , you gotta help us ! Arch and Skip and Nan ... Wait a minute . Wait a minute . What are you talking about ? That ain 't possible . And I 'm telling you , I 'm at the hospital right now visiting Buck . With Muffy ? What are you saying ? Yeah , all right , all right , all right . Look , just please , please get here , okay ? He 's on his way . He wants us to wait here and stay together . - What about the ferryman ? - It wasn 't him . They 've been together all day . - What ? - I don 't understand . I don 't either . Look , he 's gonna send up a flare as soon as he 's nearing the dock . And then we go down as a group and meet him there . In the meantime , we just wait here . It 's my father 's study . Oh , I just came in to make sure that everything was secure . I had to lock those windows . Good idea . Sometimes ... with the tides , it could take somebody ... all night to get here from the mainland . And even then sometimes they don 't make it . Yeah . Yeah . What is taking him so long ? Maybe it 's the tides . Wait a minute . Aren 't we supposed to be staying together ? What about Rob and Muffy ? - Rob 's out back checking the doors . - Yeah , well , what about Muffy ? She 's been acting less than normal anyway . - What do you mean ? - All day and you haven 't noticed ? - Well , who isn 't ? - Those are nurse 's shoes . What nurse 's shoes ? The clodhoppers she 's been walking around in today . Crepe soles ? Uh , she was arguing with Nan in the hall ... before you and Rob came back alone ... from the woods . About something Nan found in her room . - Something ... - What ? Something about an abortion . I found something in my room too . - I don 't think it was for me . - Oh , really ? - Oh , fuck you , Chaz . - What did you find ? I didn 't find anything . Uh-huh , and we 're just supposed to believe that , right ? That 's right . I spent the night with Nikki , Harve . - What about you ? - What about me ? What 's your little secret , huh ? - What are you talking about ? - Oh , come on , sporto . I came into your room . You were jumping like your ass was on fire . That was nothing ! Some newspaper clippings of some car accidents . Nothing personal in that ? - Who hasn 't had a car accident ? - I haven 't . Knock it off , Chaz ! What I wanna know is , how did Muffy find out about this stuff and ... Stop it ! Just stop it , you guys ! What 's wrong with us ? What happened to our talk ... about friendship and undying loyalty ? Do you know what we 're saying ? We 're actually sitting here ... discussing the possibility that Muffy , a good friend of ours ... has invited us all here this weekend to ... I 'm going upstairs . Muffy , listen , we should all stay together . This is my home . I 'll be in my room . She does have a point there . We 're getting on each other 's nerves . As long as we all just stay within shouting ' distance of each other . Are you coming ? I 'm gonna find a way up to the attic . Why ? I can probably see the constable better from up there . It 's all right . I can keep watch on the stairs . - Nikki , come on . - " Nikki , come on . " Don 't give me any of this " Nikki , come on . " - What are you doin ' ? - What does it look like I 'm doin ' ? Look , stay if you like . Lock your door , dig a trench , hang out . But once I leave this place , I 'm never coming back . We were supposed to all stay together . Oh , yeah , that has been real effective ! What are you ... So what are you gonna do ? Waltz down to the end of the pier by yourself ? Check your bags with the porter and wait ... for a stray ocean liner to happen by and pick you up ? I can 't stay here anymore . What if the constable never even shows ? Then I 'll swim all the way back to the mainland if I have to ! Okay , you relax . Oh , great . Three people are dead , and you are telling me to relax . Nikki , just wait a minute . Okay , Nikki ? Look at me . Nikki , look at me ! Okay , I know you 've been through a lot . We have all been through a lot . Now , am I nervous ? Yes . Am I a little bit scared ? Yes . But am I running around like a chicken with its head cut off ? - Oh , nice image . - No ! I mean , you gotta just lighten up a little bit . Come on . Hey ! Would the birdman of S and M worry ? Very funny , Chaz . You gotta look at the bright side of things . - Everything 's gonna be okay . - Would you take that thing off ? Okay . Okay . How about this one ? You are such a jerk . This one 's turning you on . I can tell . Kiss me , you savage she-devil ! Get away from me ! Stop it . Stop it some more . I love it when you 're rough . Of course , it would help a little if I could breathe in here . Just a little . Come and get it ! Very subtle , Chaz . What am I supposed to do ? Just throw off my clothes and jump on top of you ? Just wind her up and watch her go . You have got a lot to learn , buddy . What is this , show and tell ? You show me yours ... and then I get to show you mine ? Well , forget it . You can just take that thing and shove it right back in your pants . Oh , come on , Chaz . Just say something . No one 's been up here in years . Here . Do you see him ? No . He must not have a light on his boat . Maybe he 's chosen not to use it . He said something else about Muffy on the phone . - What ? - He said not to trust anyone . That 's why we were supposed to stay together . No one was to be left alone with anyone else . Then he said , " Especially not with Muffy . " - Well , what did he mean by that ? - He wouldn 't explain it . - That 's ridiculous . - Is it ? Think about it . He 's known her a lot longer than we have . Wait , wait , Rob . What 's that ? Just the dolls . - Rob , she 's been up here . - So ? Jesus ! It 's Arch , Skip and Nan . There 's two over there . Hey , he 's here . Come on . - I can 't find Harvey . - I can 't find anyone . Nikki 's door 's locked . Rob , it was locked . - Oh , Jesus ! - Wait , Rob ! What about Muffy ? - Forget her ! - She 's my friend ! Muffy , open the ... Run , Kit ! Run ! Get out of here ! Come on ! Constable Potter ? Hey , wait , Rob . Rob , don 't go in there . If there 's another flare , we can signal him . Maybe he already went back up to the house . Shit . There 's no key . Damn it . Wait , wait , wait . Look . " State Hospital . Pursuant to our previous communications , please be advised ... that the patient under discussion has still not been found ... and returned to custody , and is now believed ... to be attempting to return to her home in your jurisdiction . If encountered , exercise extreme caution ... and notify us immediately ... as Miss St. John has been a patient here for three years ... and is still considered incorrigibly unstable and extremely dangerous . " Miss St. John ? Muffy hasn 't been in an institution for three years . She 's been at Vassar . We gotta get this boat started . How ? The house . Didn 't Muffy say there was a key in the kitchen back in the house ? I can 't go back up there . I can 't go back ... We 've got no choice . We 've gotta go back . Rob , look . The doors ... they 've been closed . There . That 's how we 're goin ' in . Here , hold this . Yeah , good idea . Now , where are the stairs ? What 's that ? Rob , look . Oh , my God . - It 's Muffy 's clothes . - I don 't get it . - Whoa , whoa , whoa . - What ? What 's that ? I don 't know . Oh , my God . The picture of the girls in the study . That letter . And what the constable was trying to tell you . It 's not Muffy . It 's her twin sister , Buffy . She 's got a twin sister ! Rob , don 't you see ? Oh , my God ! Pull it away . - Rob , I can 't pull it ... - Pull it away ! The boat key ... it 's gotta be in here somewhere . Where is it ? Look on the walls ! Is there a key board ? Jesus ! Look in the cupboards ! I can 't find it ! I can 't find it ! Goddamn it ! Damn it ! Where is it ? Let me out , Kit ! Let me out of here ! Run , Kit ! Run ! Please , just leave us alone , okay ? Please . We 're just gonna go home now . Come on . - Stop ! - Babe ! Please , just let us leave . Buffy , you can stop now . Stop ! Buffy , no ! I love you , Kit ! Please . Please don 't . Please . Please , Buffy . Just let us go , please . That 's really funny , you guys ! Really funny . Fuck you ! Kit , I love you ! Kit , I love ... I love you too , babe . ... two , three ! April Fool 's ! You guys are so terrific . I love you all , and I wanna thank you from the bottom of my heart ... for being such good sports . Yeah , sure . Hey , quite welcome . Anytime . You and Kit , you two were the best ! You figured it all out . The clues ... they really worked . - What clues ? - What 's this all about ? And don 't anyone say April Fool 's again , or I 'll rip ' em apart . April Fool 's ! How about I tell ya ... it 's a script for a weekend special that 's gonna help me keep the house . Look , next month ... I get the house as part of my mother 's inheritance , it 's true ... but only if I could show my father that it could carry itself ... what with taxes and expenses and all . Otherwise , he 's gonna sell it out of the family . So I decided to turn it into a country inn . But not just a stuffy old run-of-the-mill country inn . One that specializes in offering ... a once-in-a-lifetime whodunnit weekend . I needed a rehearsal . I had to try my idea out on somebody . So you guys all had a part in this , right ? We got sucked into this just as badly as you did . Once you were all killed off , yes . But everybody had to cooperate , or none of it would 've worked . So then I guess there 's no twin sister Buffy , then . There 's a crazy twin , all right , but his name isn 't Buffy . - His name ? - Skip ? - He 's your brother ? - You bastard ! - You were in on the whole deal too . - Only the setup . She told me to say I was her cousin so we could pull the ferry prank . And I had no idea what was gonna happen to Buck . Buck Williams , makeup artist par excellence . I got somethin ' for you , big guy . Here , catch . These were old props I redressed with help from Muffy 's photographs . Sure fooled me . So I take it that this isn 't the constable . Kit Graham , I want you to meet my uncle Frank St. John ... of St. John et Freres of Wall Street . Hi . Harvey " Hal " Edison , Jr . Pleased to meet you , sir . How did I do ? I never done no actin ' before . I was really shaking ' . Cal is our regular ferryman between the mainland and the islands . But I thought he was up to the dramatic challenge . You know , Muff , you were so lucky . You could 've gotten yourself killed . Well , I nearly did with Harve over there . And who could 've known about the snake in the woods with Arch . But with the paying guests , they 're gonna know what they 're in for ... and the scenario won 't be nearly so extreme . I do regret ... some of the fake clues that I put into the bedrooms ... were taken a bit too seriously ... and I 'm sorry about that . But we had fun , didn 't we ? Come on ! I 'm never gonna forget this weekend as long as I live . You 're tellin ' me . When I was out there swinging ' in the woods , I nearly crapped my pants . What you mean , nearly ? I was there , remember ? You browned your trousers ? Well ... - You know , I was ... - It 's all right , Arch . They 'll be out of the dryer soon . Come on , drink . Drink . Come here , you maniac . Wait , Muffy , what are you ... What are you doing ? April fool .

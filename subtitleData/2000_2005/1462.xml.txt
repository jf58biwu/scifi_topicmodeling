 ( ( ( ANOTHER FINE B.G. RELEASE ) ) ) 500 years had passed , and yet the country still remained closed . Cut off from the world , knowing neither hope nor despair , the land breathed an air of quiet stag nation . Reformers , driven to armed rebellion , had been suppressed by the State . The House of Takemikazuchi were assassins hired to suppress the rebels . From ancient times , they had been guards to the rulers of a neighboring kingdom . That country , modernizing , had overthrown its monarch . Driven into exile , they had reached this land . Now , they were a tribe of assassins who would kill anyone they were paid to . The Takemikazuchi ... Mother ... Byakurai wants you . Anka fled this morning . He who flees the Takemikazuchi is a traitor . A traitor who will sell our secrets . He 's headed across Shikon Mountain . But with his leg , he won 't have reached the old mine yet . Yuki , take Kiri with you . I 'll go alone . I 'll go ! He 'l I slow me down . Why ? Take me with you ! Byakurai told you to ! Then , Kiri , could you really kill Anka ? I would . What if he begged ? I 'd still kill him ! I don 't believe you . Yuki , it 's you . I 'm unarmed . Don 't kill me . Please ... Take my sword . Tell them you killed me , okay ? I see I 'm no match for you any more , Yuki . Who are you ? My name is Kuka. I served your mother . l have something to tell you . It 's about who killed your mother . You were told she died in an attack , but it was Byakurai who killed her . Liar ! Mother was ... No ! Byakurai killed your mother Azora , Princess Takemikazuchi . You must either take revenge and succeed to your mother 's place , or leave . Tomorrow you turn twenty . On that day , a princess assumes leadership of the Takemikazuchi . You must choose either to take over the House , or to leave it . If you choose to leave , come to the old mine . I have delivered the message of Azora . Did Anka beg for his life ? Did my mother beg for hers ? What do you mean ? Your voice is shaking . Your mind 's racing . Are you aware what you 're doing ? Tell me . Byakurai , did you kill my mother ? No . Put up your sword , Yuki . I 'll overlook this . I didn 't want to tell you . Your mother was killed because she meant to betray us and flee . Liar ! and flee . Liar ! Lashing out won 't help ! I have no choice . Die ! Wonderful news from the Union Assembly . Under our Great Leader , we are winning the production war . The Ministry of Consumption reports Celebrating this news , the citizens have come out i n a spontaneous parade on the streets . Aya ? What is it ? is this to kill me with ? You 're a Takemikazuchi , aren 't you ? Who hired you ? Talk . Where are the others ? There 's no one else coming . I 'm not here to kill you . Liar . You think I believe that ? Trust me . Trust you ? You guys kill any one you 're paid to . If I trust you , I 'll end up dead . If I was after you , you 'd be dead now . Trust me ? Doesn 't that hurt ? It hurts , if you let it . I saw a woman . Where is she ? I 'm alone here . That 's my bed . Good night . We lost her at the road through the Forest Zone . You came back to tell me that ? No . Someone saw a truck . We 'll watch the road . She 'll be back . She wants revenge for her mother . Someone told her . Who ? I wonder ? Yuki 's twenty today . Whoever told her about Azora knew that , and what it means . Kuka ... So you think she wants to kill you to a venge Azora ? That means she 'll come here . If Kuka wanted to talk to Yuki , where would he call her to ? To his home ? I ' d find a better place than that . " How have you been ? It 's Kidokoro . " " l 'm back . There 's something I want to talk to you about . " " l 'll come today . " No , I 'II come to you the day after tomorrow . Roger . I 'II be waiting at the usual place . A man had pledged with Azora , heir to the House of Takemikazuchi . He swore fealty to the House , but Byakurai framed him as a traitor and killed him . That man was my father ? You wouldn 't remember . You 'd only just turned two . There were still many of Takemikazuchi blood . Byakurai sought to marry Azora himself , and make the House of Takemikazuchi his . But Azora refused . Discouraged , your mother sought to bring the Takemikazuchi to an end . Byakurai found out and killed her . Then , everything changed . Many were unhappy with Byakurai , and tried to leave the Takemikazuchi . But only very few managed to escape . Princess Azora was killed here . I 'm sure she hoped you would leave the Takemikazuchi . She wanted you to succeed where she had failed . You need not take revenge on Byakurai . The fate of the Takemikazuchi is to disappear . Princess Yuki ... Your mother had been tortured almost to death , but the final blow came from me . kill me if you will . My life since then has been one of waiting for this day . I offered to accompany her to the next world , but she wouldn 't allow it . I was commanded to tell you everything when you reached twenty years of age . If Princess Yuki were to do me the honor of killing me ... Don 't say that . There 's no point . So it was you , Kuka . Soma ... My , how you 've grown ! By your leave ... Kuka ! Yuki , this is what I wanted ! Princess Yuki ! Don 't die ! kill me if you want , but don 't raise your blades against Princess Yuki ! That I can 't promise . Kuka ! When I was small , I was always happy . I never dreamed things would turn out like this . You know why people thought that way then ? It 's because no one had any ideals . Yes , people died when we put a bomb in the Assembly . But it was very effective . You should be proud . It was a holiday . No one was supposed to be there . You told me that . Losses are inevitable . You don 't get something for nothing . Mimura knew that . His death wasn 't wasted . No one pays any attention unless a few dozen citizens die . I 'd like to move on to the next project . Mr. Sugimoto ... Didn 't think so . He called you while I was gone ? Last month . Sugimoto 's been expelled . I trust you . We have to do whatever 's necessary to achieve our ideals . Takashi , do you know the safest place in the jung le ? On the lion 's back . The fleas there enjoy the most peaceful life there is . Hey ... Hey ... Hey ! Damn ! Where are you bleeding ? Eat . You need protein , or you won 't heal . Put these on . That 's all there is here . Hurry up ! Wow ... It suits you . What are you doing ? Throwing these out . You saw Mr. Kidokoro ? Yeah . Takashi , be careful of him . Did you hear about Sugimoto ? Yeah . Mr. Kidok oro told me he 'd been expelled . He 's dead . Murdered . I 'm leaving this country . There 's happiness somewhere . You just have to go there . Who 's that ? A guest . A guest ? So you 've found happiness ? Take care . Cal l me if you want to come . Thanks . Why did you come back ? What 's happened now ? Don 't want to say ? It 's probably safer for me if I don 't know . Hey , does it bother you to kill someone ? Why do you kill people ? For money ? My body moves . When I hold my sword and close in on a target , my body just moves , before I can think why . Aw , the tragedy of the Takemikazuchi ! Some king stops paying his guards , so they put their skills on the market . You kill people for no reason . Not to defend your country , not to defend yourselves . You have nothing to defend . You just kill . But I had ... A reason . I had a reason . I 'm sure I had ... A reason to kill . Come with me . My sister . When she was eight , I came home from school to find blood everywhere , and just her alive . The guys who did it were let off for lack of evidence . So I killed them myself . I was caught , tried , and sentenced . When I got out four years later , I couldn 't see things the way I had before . Everything looked completely different . Then I met someone who said he wanted me to be as happy as I ' d been before . No one else said that . I ' ve done things , and been pushed into doing things . To get back to being happy , I ' ve rationalized everything . Renkyo ? Yes . I need to talk to you . About what ? Can we really kill Yuki ? Without her , we have no leader of Takemikazuchi blood . And then ... Then what ? And then ... Then what ? We 've al ready lost just about everyone of Takemikazuchi blood . But ... What reason do we have to exist without that name ? We don 't need a reason . Now , we have ... Nothing left to guard anymore . I venerated our ancestors . I believed in the motherland . But when the monarchy fell , our swords were taken from us . Those who were caught had their memories erased with drugs , and , to slow their arms , needles driven into their elbows . We fled , without turning our swords on the motherland . Remember , Renkyo ? Those tanks on that southern island we saw as we went ? A group of ruined tanks , all eaten away by acid rain , and stinking of corpses . But there were no corpses . The stench was coming from us . At that time ... We were dead . Hello ? Hello ? It 's me . Hello ? It 's me . Mr. Kidokoro ... Why did you call ? I sent you a schematic . Can you take a look at it ? Yes ... I 'm going to look now . Did you see it ? Yeah ... I want to move in ten days . Yeah ... I want to move in ten days . Did you hear that ? Ten days ... I can 't . Okay , when ? Never . No ? No . I understand . I 'll be in touch . You always look so sad . And you have no expression at all . Have you ever been sad ? I make it go away . Just like pain . And that 's how you can kill people ? When you 're sad , you should grieve , and when you 're happy ... You should celebrate . Have you ever laughed ? When I 'm sad , I grieve . For hours . For days . For years . Hey ... Have you ever heard of a " miki-ishi ? " No . It means " beautiful precious stone . " They 're rare . You can look all year and be lucky to find even one . When you grind it on a whetstone , you get a little green crystal . My mother collected them . When she found one , she would carefully polish and save it . When she had thirty , she was going to make a necklace for my wedding day . She said she 'd put it around my neck the day I got married . She started collecting them at eighteen , had me at twenty-two . And died at twenty-seven . When she died , she had nine of these crystals in a little treasure box . Not enough for a necklace . S oon I 'll pass the age she was when she had me . And then her age when she died . But I ... Haven 't collected anything I could leave ... To any one . I don 't have anyone to leave anything to . I feel ... That there is no one I want ... To treasure . Let 's leave here . Leave this country together . There 's nothing holding us here . Somewhere , there must be a place we can forget everything . Let 's go there . Mother ... Now ... I 'm happy . You think you 'll ever be happy ? Even if you kill me , you still walk the path of blood . You can 't a void it . Mr. Kidokoro ... Your sister looks wel l . What do you want ? Oh ... If it 's about that schematic ... No , I changed plans . This one 's a great idea . I 'm sure you 'll like it . What is it ? We find common ground with the government . We achieve our ideals , and very few people get hurt . What do you think , Takashi ? Good plan , huh ? You 're selling me out ? It 's a deal . We respect the law , and our ideals are realized . Traitor ! In spirit we will continue . The plan I sent you was to be the last . Because we 'd all be killed ? Don 't talk like that , Takashi . Isn 't that what you 've wanted all along anyway ? But this way you 're safe . I said it was a deal ! A fair deal . So why did we do all that ? Why all those victims ? ! It meant something . We all acted because we believed in our ideals . No , we believed in you ! Manabe shot . Kazuki tortured . Mimura blown up . They all believed in you ! You said we 'd be happy again . You 're the only one who was ! Happiness will come . Of course it won 't be free. I told you the price would be high . All we can do is pray for the victims . But you don 't have to pray , Takashi . You 're one of the victims we 'll be praying for . You bastard ! I am Azora 's daughter , The Princess Blade of the Takemikazuchi . In the name of my mother , I take your life ! Don 't you understand ? It 's over ! Get lost ! I 'll keep this . Live ... Be happy ... Live for me . Takashi ... Takashi ...

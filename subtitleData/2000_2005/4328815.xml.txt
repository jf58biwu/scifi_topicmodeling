 Voice , relax . Hel , the Betrayer attack was a major security breach . If it relayed your location to ... The move 's on schedule . The new lab systems are priming up as ... we ... speak . Mauser , we have a glitch with the ... What the ... ? Mm ... Mm , that 's nice . A little lower ? Oh , give it up . Well , what do you think ? But you 've altered it in some way . Oh , you mean the ankle pads and the extra hip pockets that served absolutely no purpose ? Yes , I 've ripped them off . - But ... - Look , Mauser . In the 21 st century - the one year I saw of it - guys got a little further by complimenting a girl 's outfit . - Good luck . - It covers you well . Hel ? Come on . Honestly . That 's great , Cleo . Sarge , we 're under attack ! Hel , what 's happening ? - What the hell was that ? I don 't know , but I don 't like it . Tuck and roll . Hel , is Mauser secure ? - Not yet . Hel , Mauser must not be captured . Creegan , we are not secure . I don 't care . I want Mauser . Creegan ! Hel , have you secured Mauser ? - Not yet . Mauser must not be captured . If you can 't secure him ... .. eliminate him . Now , that wasn 't so hard , was it ? - Mauser 's dead ! - He 's not dead . He 's just off line . Let 's go ! Creegan ! Helen . Ahh ! 500 years into the future , she will enter a world where machines rule the Earth . Mankind has been driven underground . And Cleopatra is about to discover there 's no place like home . ln the year 2525 There are women with the will to survive Fighting for a brand-new day Nothing 's gonna get in their way And in the year 2525 Three women keep hope alive Joining forces to reclaim the Earth Looking ahead to humankind 's rebirth COMPUTER : Priority destruct sequence active . Everything we know , Mauser knows . If Creegan compromises that , he could access information about you , the other teams , every level . Creegan 's not gonna get that far . - Need a third wheel ? - I sure don 't recommend staying here . Come on , Hel ! COMPUTER : Ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one . Wake up . Hi . If you 're planning on splitting my nanoplasma , you 're wasting your time . It 's encoded with four security backups . Oh . I thought it was five . At least ... .. let me try . Unless , of course , you want to tell me in your own words everything I want to hear . Siphon . Siphon activated . With you in a sec . The signal 's weak . We haven 't got much time . Keep moving down . Hey , Hel . - That Creegan , what did he do ? - He murdered my family . Wait ! - Where 's she going ? - The Voice is leading us to Mauser . You just accept that ? I 've never had a reason not to . So , who is this Voice ? The Voice has saved us many times . She 's the reason we 're gonna take back the surface . So ? Who ... is ... this ... Voice ? ! Mr Mauser , I can only hope that you 're too important for Helen and company not to look for you . So ... .. l command you . Where 's that little homing beacon ? Hemisphere five , grid 23 of the neurosynaptic net . What does that mean ? You know what that means ? Uh-uh . Anyone ? Why can 't you just say , " It 's ... behind ... my ... left ... ear " ? Always making them harder to reach . But ... I do believe we have a trace . And there she is ! Leave me . Just buy me some playtime . Mauser 's 30 metres down . Helen ! Then make a hard left and you 're there . - Voice ? Hello ! What 's happening ? Helen ! Creegan . So , you do carry The Voice . Do you like mine better ? It sounds different . I guess that 's what happens when somebody rips out half your throat . What was dear old Dad - trying to do to me , huh ? - What I 'm gonna do to you . You know , Helen , at the proper pitch , that little voice receptor inside your head could actually ... burst ! Uhh ! Uh-ha . Uhh . No , that 's not it . I 'd love to chat with you in person , but ... Mauser just can 't seem to keep his head shut . He 's already told me everything I need to know about you , others like you . - Others like me ? What are you talking about ? - Mindless drones , running around doing errands for a voice . And for what , I ask ? To rid the underworld of Betrayers ? To retake the surface from the mighty Bailies ? Exercises in futility . Tell me we 're almost there . Unless The Voice knows something I don 't . Perhaps Mauser can shed some light on that subject , too . Bye . Launch the attack ! Ow ! Help , help ! - - Sarge ! I can 't hold them , Hel ! Ahh ! Hold on to the shaft . - Come on , Hel . - Aaargh ! Oh . Hel , are you OK ? It 's up to you . OK . Aaargh ! Come on , Hel , talk to us . Creegan 's tapped the beacon . - He 's gonna blow the voice receptor . - Take it out . No time . Go get Mauser . Uhh ! - Maybe a precision shot up the jaw . - What ? - The receptor 's in her ear . - That 's gonna do the trick ? - Sarge , go ! - All for one and one for nothing , right , Cleo ? Yeah . Sarge ! - Take this . - What is this ? - What do I do with this ? - Run it up her jaw . Remove the voice receptor . No ! I 've never even played a surgeon . I 'm a little busy right now ! Stop . Go back . Oh . Isn 't she dying right about now ? Hurry ! - What am I looking for ? - You 'll know it when you see it . I see it ! You 've got to cut it out . Er ... OK . Hurry ! Almost there . OK ? OK . I got it ! I got it . OK . OK . Hel , do you hear me ? Hel ? Helen ? - Hello ? - Ahh ! Come on ! Mr Mauser , this weapon is Bailey in origin . Hel has made progress in leaps and bounds , hasn 't she ? Get to Mauser . If we 're not too late . HEL . I 'll cover you . - Protect the plasma . Sarge , the siphon ! Out of my way ! They 've blown up the siphon and damaged the link . Sarge ! Sarge ! Come here . They 've cut off the siphon . Mauser 's memory download has stopped . Give me what we have . We don 't have anything . The information was deleted . I 'm upset you 're here , Helen , but if you tell me more about this Bailey toy of yours ... .. perhaps I can re-channel some of my anger . I 'm speaking to Helen ! So , tell me . Did Mauser incorporate some of this technology into your arsenal ? You 're about to find out . That 's not it , Hel . No , but this is . Sarge , now ! Help ! He-e-elp ! - Ow ! - Sorry . Sorry . There we go . Hel , you should be hearing voices any time now . Thanks , Cleo . You did good . Thanks . Hel , I 'm sorry I couldn 't stop them . Hey , it 's OK , Mauser . Really . Hel , can you hear me ? Yes , Voice , I hear you . - We got Mauser back . And Creegan ? He didn 't get anything , but we didn 't get him . Don 't worry . We will . So , Voice ... both you and Creegan mentioned something about " others like me " . Is there something you want to tell me ? Their identities and their locations are safe because of you and your team , Hel . I don 't know what else to say , but ... .. you 're not alone . Next week : 103 Flying Lessons

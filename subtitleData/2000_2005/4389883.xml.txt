 Good day to you . Good day to you . Good morning , Tom . Good morning , Grace . So , where are you heading ? Uh , Sullivan 's . Care to join me ? Oh , I wish I could , but there 's a bit of a problem . Oh , really ? Well , you see , Tommy , me boy , the good Lord blessed me with a fine wife . I 'll never forget the day I met her . I was on me way to the fair in Dooleen ... or was it Kilkee ? There 's some fine trout fishing to be had in Kilkee this time of year . Who said anything about trout ? Timothy Ryan , God rest his soul . He was one for the trout . The poor man 's been dead a fortnight . Some say he had the croup , but don 't you believe it . The widow Moore gave him the evil eye . And ... your point ? Me wife and l- - well , we 've hit a bit of a rough patch . A better woman never walked the face of the earth . She threw you out again . With nothing but the clothes on me back . How much ? A shilling or two should suffice . Keep the change . God bless you , Tommy , me boy . Harry ... weren 't you supposed to meet me at Sullivan 's ? Oh , sorry , I got distracted by the , uh , scenery . This is Maggie . We 've met . Could you excuse us ? Charmed to have met you , Harry . Charmed . What 's the hurry ? A word to the wise- - stay away from Maggie O 'Halloran . She 's promised to a pig farmer with a very large rake . Well , does she have a sister ? Wooden teeth . Oh , nothing an little ... adjustment to the holo-matrix wouldn 't fix . No , no , I 'm not changing a thing . Fair Haven is perfect just the way it is . Tommy boy , you forgot the leprechauns . Yeah . No . No leprechauns , no aliens , no starships . I want this to be a place where the crew can unwind . Morning , lads . Ah , heard any good confessions lately ? Doctor / patient confidentiality , Mr. Paris . Harry hasn 't seen Sullivan 's yet . Do you care to join us ? Don 't mind if I do . I 'll need to leave no later than 1300 hours . Medical emergency ? Not exactly . I 'm working on my homily for Sunday 's mass , and I expect both you sinners ... to be in attendance . He 's kidding , right ? You wanted authenticity . Everybody , place your bets ! Three bob on Liam . Three bob it is . Five shillings on Liam . You 're going to hurt Harry 's feelings . Oh , very well . Two shillings on Mr. Kim , and I 'll pray for a miracle . Excuse me , Father , but I needed a bit of counsel . I 'm off duty right now . But I 've broken the Fifth Commandment again . Say ten " Our Fathers " and call me in the morning . - Oh , thank you , Father . - Gentlemen . Come on , come on , Mr. Kim . Show him what for . You can do it . What 'll it be ? I 'm looking for some friends of mine . Well , we 're all friends here . Well , then , have you seen Tom Paris ? He 's right over there with young Harry . Poor sod . I 'm afraid no one 's whipped Liam in three years . There 's a first time for everything . An optimist , are you ? A realist . Come on , Ensign , try ! Try ! Come on , me boy , push , push ! I 'm trying ! Come on ! Try harder ! You got him ! You got him , lad ! You got him ! What ? ! What in God 's name ... ? ! Come on , Liam , push ! Yes ! Yes ! I knew you could do it , Ensign . So , this is the program I 've been hearing so much about . Welcome , weary traveler . You have outdone yourself this time . Everything is authentic except for one tiny detail . Oh ? The harp on the sign- - it 's backwards . Oh . Everybody 's a critic . As I recall , the Captain is quite an aficionado of Irish history . I hate to break up the party , but we have some business to attend to . There 's a neutronic wavefront approaching , class-9 . Class-9 ? Sorry , boys , duty calls . Uh , " wavefront " ? Now , what in the name of God is that ? Um , a wee bit of bad weather . Oh . Borg classification 3472 , partical density anomaly . Where 'd it come from ? I believe it was formed by the collision of two neutron stars . The wavefront is traveling at a velocity of 200,000 kilometers per second , and it extends for 3.6 light-years . How long before it hits ? Approximately 15 hours . We 're already feeling its effects . The neutron radiation is disrupting plasma flow . We can 't jump to warp . Impulse power won 't be enough to outrun that thing . Then we 'll have to ride it out . We 'll generate an inverse warp field and drop anchor . That should protect us from the turbulence . What about the radiation ? It 'll only get worse . Have the Doctor prepare inoculations for the crew . Go to Yellow Alert . Tom , B 'Elanna , get started on converting the warp core . Yes , ma 'am . Let 's batten down the hatches . Captain . Just burning the midnight oil . Midnight 's come and gone . Then it 's time for a break . Do you mind ? I could use the company . This approaching wavefront- - it 's bringing back some unpleasant memories . How so ? You know I grew up on a farm in Indiana . We used to have some terrible thunderstorms during the summer months . At the first bolt of lightning , I 'd bolt under the bed . We had some pretty nasty weather on Talax , too . l-l always enjoyed a good ion storm . Give me clear skies any day . Well , n-n-now that you bring it up , uh , I am concerned with keeping up morale over the next few days . The crew is not used to sitting still . Suggestions ? Everyone seems to love Fair Haven . I was thinking we might initiate an open-door protocol on the holodeck and keep the program running 24 hours a day , let people come and go as they please . Permission granted . Fair Haven 's just become our port in the storm . I 'm , uh , heading down there myself if you 'd like to join me . There 's a charming little inn called The Ox and Lamb . The owner offered to share some of his recipes . No , thanks . I still have work to do . Okay . What 'll it be ? A cup of tea would be nice . I just made one . - Cream ? - Please . So , what brings you to Fair Haven , Miss ... ? Kathryn . I 'm just passing through ... on my way home . How long have you been on the road ? Five years , almost six . - You must be homesick . - No . Sometimes . Thank you . " Cead mil failte . " Translation ? " A hundred thousand welcomes . " It 's an old Irish saying . We 're all friends here . I had an aunt who used to have a saying like that . " A stranger is a friend you just haven 't met yet . " Definitely Irish . She had an Irish temper , too . She and my uncle had a place not far from here in County Clare . Ah ... then you 're closer to home than you think , Katie O 'Clare . You know , it 's later than I thought , and I 've kept you long enough . Oh , now , stay awhile . Didn 't your auntie teach you that it 's impolite to leave without playing a game of rings ? I really can 't , but thanks for the tea . Afraid you 'd lose ? I rarely lose . Prove it . One game . I 'll set them up . Another ringer . Well , I 'm not surprised . You stepped over the beer stain . - l did not . - You did , too , by half a boot , and then you moved back , hoping I wouldn 't notice . These boots are half a size too large , so in reality , my toes never crossed the line . Your turn . For luck . Getting sweet with the rings isn 't going help you . We 'll see . Damn ! Devil won 't help you , either . Well , maybe rings aren 't my forte after all . Would you care to arm wrestle ? That 's not a woman 's game , Katie . You could get hurt . I 'm stronger than I look . Ah ! Now , that 's quite a grip you have . Not bad yourself . I couldn 't help but notice that you have your leg braced against the bar . Well , how else do you expect me to win ? Well , will we call it a draw ? Sounds good to me . We run a foot race down to the station and back ? It 's good to make a new friend . You have a nice way about you . " Flattery 's the food of fools . " Another pearl of wisdom from your auntie ? No . Jonathan Swift . Swift ? Never heard of him . He was an author . I was never one for reading . Well , that 's too bad . Some of the greatest writers in the world are Irish . Well , they say that Dr. Gilroy has a library of books , and , well , next time I see him , I 'll ask him can I borrow one or two ? Good mornin ' . Good mornin ' . Oh , my God , will you look at the time ? Frannie , come here . There 's someone I want you to meet . Katie O 'Clare , this is my wife , Francis . Pleased to meet you . I hope Michael hasn 't been bending your ear - all night long . - My ear , my elbow ... We were arm wrestling . Mmm , such a gentleman . Well , thank you very much for your hospitality , and now I really must be leaving . And , uh , drop in again before you leave town . I will ! If you experience any dizziness , report to Sick Bay immediately . Thank you . Good morning , gentlemen . I believe it 's afternoon- - oversleep ? - Holodeck . - Fair Haven ? Welcome , weary traveler . Even I have to admit- - Mr. Paris ' latest effort is quite a tour de force . Ooh , high praise from a hologram . Oh , I was thinking , Captain- - now that we 've got this open-door policy , maybe I could expand Fair Haven into Holodeck 2 . It would give me some room to create the seacoast . - By all means . - Speaking of revisions , I was hoping I could give my character a more active role . In the period you 've created , the village priest was the most prominent member of the community , held in the highest regard . You know , that 's a great idea , Doc . We could send Father Mulligan on a retreat to a nearby monastery , where he takes a vow of silence and never speaks again . Try it ! And you 'll be saying " Hail Marys " till St. Patrick 's Day . Time ? 30 seconds . Let 's see it . All hands , this is the Captain . Secure your stations and brace for impact . We 've cleared the leading edge . Turbulence is decreasing . Shields are holding . - Damage ? - We 've got a ruptured plasma conduit , Deck 9 . Send a repair team . Maintain Yellow Alert . Let 's hope that was the worst of it . Captain 's Personal Log . It 's been ten hours since the storm hit . We estimate another three days before we 're clear of it . The crew 's in good spirits , and many of them have taken the opportunity to visit Fair Haven . I met an interesting man there , and for a while , I almost forgot he was a hologram . We weren 't exactly compatible . Then again , Mr. Paris didn 't program him to my specifications . Computer , display Fair Haven character Michael Sullivan . Adjust his parameters to the following specifications ... Give him the education of a 19th century ... third-year student at Trinity College . Modification complete . Now ... access the character 's interactive subroutines . Make him more provocative . Specify . Give him a more complicated personality . Specify . More outspoken ... more confident , not so reserved ... and make him more curious about the world around him . Modification complete . Good . Now ... increase the character 's height by ... three centimeters . Remove the facial hair . No ... no , I don 't like that . Put some back- - about two days ' growth . Better . Oh , one more thing . Access his interpersonal subroutines ... familial characters . Delete the wife . Modification complete . Pleased to meet you , Mr. Sullivan . Are you ill , Commander ? I am experiencing a slight loss of equilibrium and some gastrointestinal distress . Space sickness ? Unlikely. I 'm not prone to that condition . Perhaps you should go to Sick Bay . I 'll be fine . I 'm telling you , we should add more fog . Fog is depressing . It 's authentic ! It 's dangerous ! All right , we could add a lighthouse . It 's Fair Haven , Harry . Sunshine . Tuvok , what do you think : Irish seacoast- - fog or no fog ? I have no opinion . He hasn 't visited our little paradise yet . Nor do I intend to . I think you 'd like it , Commander . It 's a great place to meditate . Imagine yourself sitting high on a bluff overlooking the ocean . Salt air ... the rhythm of the waves rising and crashing against the rocks ... a tiny fishing boat bobbing on the water below ... up and down , up and down . I get the idea , Ensign . Thank you . Mutton , creamed cabbage or blood pudding ? Explain . I 'm preparing a traditional Irish meal at The Ox and Lamb this afternoon , and I cannot decide on a main course . Blood pudding- - you can 't lose . Well , that was my first choice , too , but replicating the lamb 's intestines- - it-it could be tricky , and every time I try to heat the blood , it coagulates in the milk . If you 'll excuse me . I think I will consult the Doctor . Excuse me , ma 'am . Hmm ? Have you seen Michael Sullivan ? Oh , you might try the pub . I just came from there . Oh , then he 'll be at the train station . Yeah . Thank you . Sure . Excuse me , sir . is the train to Galway running on time ? Um ... I 'm afraid you 've just missed it . Have a seat . Wait for the next one . Do you know Jane Eldon ? Eldon . No , I 've never met her . Well , I 'd be terrified if you had . She 's been dead 70 years . No , I was , uh ... I was thinking about her poetry . It 's too pastoral for my taste . Don 't you agree ? I 'm not familiar with her work . Really ? Well , what about Sean Gogarty ? They have similar rhyming schemes . You 've some catching up to do . Well , I 'm here every afternoon . You should join me sometime . I tried talking poetry with Seamus , but all he can do is recite limericks . I 'd love to . Strange place to read , though . Not at all . I love the sound of the trains coming and going . Gets me thinking about places I 'd like to visit . Have you traveled much yourself ? As a matter of fact ... But there 's one place I haven 't been yet- - Castle O 'Dell . It 's a steep climb , but from the top of the battlement , you can see all the way to Dublin . We 'd better be moving . They say when the sun goes down , the King of the Faeries reclaims the castle . Maybe he 'll invite us to supper . Eh , you 'll be dining alone , without me . One taste of the faeries ' banquet , and you 'll never return to this world . Oh , don 't tell me you believe those stories . Believe ? No . But I do respect them . Can I ask you something , Katie ? Please . Have you a man waiting for you at home ? No . Are you looking for one ? Why , do you have somebody ? In Fair Haven ? Not unless you fancy a pig farmer . Oh , not my type . Well , what about a barkeep who reads poetry in strange places ? Captain ? I thought that was you . Just getting in the spirit . I can see that . I don 't believe we 've met . Sullivan . Michael Sullivan . Chakotay . That 's a fine tattoo . Are you off a ship ? You could say that . We 're on the way up to the old castle . You 're welcome to come with us . Thanks , but , um ... I 'm meeting Neelix at The Ox and Lamb . You two have fun . is it my imagination , or did he call you Captain ? Did he ? Looks like the worst is yet to come . Commander ? I just came from Astrometrics . Seven 's found an increase in the neutronic gradient at the trailing edge of the wavefront . It 's going to be a rough ride when it hits . We 've still got two days . Start working on a new shield modulation . Yes , ma 'am . That could explain my recent space sickness . Vulcan physiology is highly sensitive to neutronic gradients . You 'd make a good barometer , Tuvok . Every time you get queasy , we go to Red Alert . Thanks for your report , Commander . Don 't mention it . Hills Most Green , Hearts Unseen . Yes . Jane Eldon . Catching up on a little reading . Those hills and hearts wouldn 't happen to be in Ireland ? You can wipe that smirk off your face . It 's not what you think . I wasn 't thinking anything , but now that you mention it ... I have an interest in Irish culture . It 's understandable . They 've produced great writers for hundreds of years ... not to mention great bartenders . He 's a hologram . I couldn 't help but notice- - he seemed a little taller than the last time I saw him . Yes , I made a few modifications . In the interest of Irish culture ? Exactly . You seemed embarrassed when I ran into you . There was no reason to be . It was nice to see you having a little fun . He is rather charming , isn 't he ? Too bad he 's made of photons and force fields . I never let that stand in my way . The boys are getting tired . Them or you ? Faster , boys ! Computer ... remove all characters except for Michael Sullivan . Can I ask you something , Katie ? Please . Would you mind if I kissed you ? I might even kiss you back . There 's no point in waiting any longer , is there ? Oh , I think I 've waited long enough . is there something wrong ? No . Computer , recycle . Come in . I thought you 'd like to know we 've organized a rings tournament tonight at Sullivan 's . Thanks , Neelix , but I have work to do . The Doctor 's going to sing something called " Danny Boy " , and Mossie Donegan 's promised to bring his talking pig . Well , let 's just say I 'd rather stick to reality right now . 1900 hours ... if you change your mind . Thank you . Saints preserve us . I possess superior hand / eye coordination . That 's not all that 's superior . The lily and the rose are staging a competition on your face . Clarify . The fullness of your lips and the paleness of your cheeks- - it 's enough to make a man faint . Then , in that case , perhaps we should sit down . I don 't believe it . It 's called " old-world charm , " Harry . What 'll it be , gentlemen ? Nothing for me . " Temperance is a virtue . " Where 's Michael ? Over there . That 's strange . I programmed him not to drink . Must be a glitch in his subroutine . Are these seats taken ? Sit anywhere you like . Vile . It 's been 15 years since I touched the stuff . You making up for lost time ? I was hoping it might ease the pain . Are you in discomfort ? Agony 's more like it . How could you do this to me , Lord ? Why don 't you ask him ? You 've got his ear , don 't you ? Well ... Three days ... the happiest three days of my life . I was a fool to think she felt the same . I was such a fool ! Aw , sit down , Sullivan . Shut your mouth , man , or I 'll shut it for you . Oh , you will , will you ? Hey , hey , hey ... take it easy . Um ... why don 't you tell us what happened ? We ... we spent a perfect day together by the lake . I drifted off to sleep , and ... when I woke up , she was gone . Where is she , Tom ? Who ? Katie O 'Clare- - who else ? Katie O 'Clare ? Your friend . Um ... are you sure you didn 't ... uh ... misinterpret her interests ? I mean , we 're all friends here . Maybe she was just being friendly . You calling me a liar ? N-no , no , not at all . I thought ... Katie and me were in love . I may have to do some reprogramming ... What 's the matter ? You don 't think I 'm good enough for her ? No , l-l didn 't say that . Well , tell me where she 's gone . I don 't know . Well , I think you do ! Gentlemen , please ! " Love thy neighbor . " Let 's see ... I remember trying to reach the holodeck controls . Then , uh , somebody grabbed my leg . Maybe it was the talking pig . If it was , he had one hell of a left hook . What 's all this ? I 'm afraid there 's been some trouble in paradise- - an altercation in the pub this afternoon . Several crewmen were injured . Nothing serious . Arm wrestling get out of hand , boys ? Not exactly . It was Michael Sullivan , Captain . He was looking for someone . Why don 't we ... take a little walk ? Let me guess- - that someone is me . I don 't mean to pry , Captain , but we 've got a broken-hearted hologram who believed that the two of you were in love . Oh , I was sure he 'd be on to the next lass by now . I hope he 's all right . Far from it . The fight spilled out onto the street . Before long , he 'd climbed up a tree and began shouting your name . Mr. Neelix managed to ... talk him down . It could be a malfunction in his behavioral subroutines . I 've already checked that . His subroutines are fine ... but I did notice you 've made quite a number of alterations to his program . Minor improvements . To make him more appealing ? You 're starting to pry , Doctor . I apologize for overstepping my bounds , but I 'm worried about you . Michael Sullivan is a hologram . His broken heart can be mended with the flick of a switch . Your feelings , however , are a little more ... complicated . I 'm not going to be climbing any trees , if that 's what you 're worried about . If you decide you want to talk , I 've been hearing a lot of confessions lately . Let me know . You want a confession , Doctor ? All right . I 've become romantically involved with a hologram , if that 's possible . Tell me what happened . Oh , you know the story- - girl meets boy ; girl modifies boy 's subroutines . Did you have intimate relations ? That 's none of your business . Let 's just say it was a memorable three days . I don 't see the problem . Don 't you ? Michael Sullivan is exactly my type- - attractive , intelligent . We share the same interests , and if there 's something I don 't like , I can simply change it . I 've noticed that humans usually try to change the people they fall in love with . What 's the difference ? In this case , it works . We had a picnic by the lake yesterday afternoon . Michael drifted off to sleep . His head was lying on my shoulder , and I remember thinking , " This is close to perfect . " Then he began to snore . Did I nudge him with my elbow , hoping he 'd roll over and stop ? Did I whisper in his ear to wake him ? No . Why bother , when I could simply access the computer and alter his vocal algorithms ? And that 's exactly what I was about to do , when I realized that everything around me was an illusion , including him , so I left . Oh , I almost wrote him a note to say good-bye . Could you believe that- - a " Dear John " letter to a hologram ? I understand your trepidation ... but you 're the Captain . You can 't have a relationship with a member of your crew . They 're all your subordinates . So where does that leave you- - the occasional dalliance with a passing alien ? Voyager could be in the Delta Quadrant for a very long time . A hologram may be the only logical alternative . He 's not real . He 's as real as I am . Photons and force fields ; flesh and blood- - it 's all the same , as long as your feelings are real . He makes a joke ; you laugh . is that an illusion ? He says something that makes you think . Does it matter how his molecules are aligned ? Did it ever occur to you that it 's not just a question of whether or not he 's real ? What do you mean ? I think you should stop trying to control every aspect of this relationship . Romance is born out of differences as well as similarities ... out of the unexpected as well as the familiar . Maybe I just needed to be sure ... he 'd love me back . But isn 't that the risk you always take , hologram or not ? All I know is ... Michael Sullivan was up in that tree , shouting your name . I 've never been afraid of taking risks . Then perhaps next time , you should just ... let him snore . The neutronic gradient 's rising- - 30 million terajoules ... 40 million . Shields . Holding . 60 million . Torres to Bridge . The inverse warp field 's destabilizing . We 're losing our anchor . Acknowledged . How long before we 're clear ? At least another five minutes . That 's about four minutes too long . The gradient 's rising fast- - 90 million . Stabilizers are off-line . Thrusters . No effect . Shields are failing . How close are we to the perimeter ? A thousand kilometers , but we 're being pulled along with the storm . What have you got in mind ? The deflector beam- - we might be able to cut a path through the wavefront . It 's possible , but we 'd have to route all available power to the emitters . That won 't be enough . Primary systems are down . Then transfer all secondary power sources- - transporters , replicators , holodecks . Captain , there 's not enough time to go through the hologrid shutdown sequence . We 'd lose most of Fair Haven . Do it . Hull fractures , Decks 6 and 7 . You 've got all the secondary power , Tuvok . is that enough ? Negative . Siphon energy from the plasma network- - every last deciwatt ! Deflector beam active . We 're approaching the perimeter . 500 kilometers ... 400 ... Deflector output is dropping . Give him everything we 've got- - life support , environmental control . Scrape the residual ions off the sonic showers if you have to . Doesn 't look good , Tom . With this much photonic decay , we 'll be able to save five , maybe ten percent . So much for the luck of the Irish . It might be easier to start from scratch . It wouldn 't be the same . It 's like trying to rewrite a novel after the only copy of the data file 's been deleted . All the details , the nuances- - they 're all gone . Morning , lads . Hey , Seamus . Looks like a storm brewing . A storm ? Heading in from the west . Could be a big one . Oh ... you 're right . I don 't suppose you could spare a shilling or two ? Me wife and I made up last night , and I wanted to buy her a new parasol . The grid 's destabilizing . We 'd better get started on those repairs . So , what do we try and save ? The Ox and Lamb ? The church ? Maggie O 'Halloran ? There 's someone I should talk to before we decide . Come in . Fair Haven didn 't fare too well . I 'll break the news to the crew . With your permission , I 'd like to try to reconstruct the program . How long will it take ? Six or seven weeks . Harry tells me that we should be able to save about ten percent of the existing elements . I thought you might have a suggestion or two . Computer , is Fair Haven character Michael Sullivan still intact ? Affirmative . Activate him . Hello . You disappeared on me , Katie . I woke up , and you had gone . I had some thinking to do . Are you done ? Yes . I 'm leaving Fair Haven . Why ? Because . That 's not a very good reason . The situation is complicated . Another man ? No . Your friends ... they don 't approve of me ? They think you 're charming . Are you not ready to settle down yet ? I 'm as ready as I 'll ever be . You 're not making any sense . No , I guess I 'm not . Well , I have a feeling that , uh , you won 't be forgetting us that easily . Fair Haven has that effect on people . But there 's one thing I want you to know . I love you , Katie . I might actually be passing this way in , uh ... six or seven weeks . Maybe I 'll stop by the pub . See that you do . Oh , computer , end program . Wait . I want to make one more modification to the character . Specify . Deny Kathryn Janeway any future access to his behavioral subroutines . Modification complete . Save program .

 Dear dad , back at thunder Mountain , Marcus got a message from Jesse Montoya , one of his guys in the field who feeds us information from time to time . Cryptic , but what else is new ? He said to get down to cranston , fast . " There 's something your people should see . " " His people . " That would be us . We 'll park the rover further outside town than usual and walk in . There 's a lot of unspecified , bad shit going on around cranston . All right , this is where we 're supposed to meet him ? Yeah , but why in the hell did Jesse pick this place ? We could 've met him someplace outside of town . Look , we get in , we get out , we stay out of trouble . Now , you see some shit , no matter how intriguing it looks , it 's not our problem , all right ? I don 't like this , man . Me , neither . It looks pretty skiddy . Hey , Jesse , you here at all ? Shit ! Help me ! Help me ! Kurdy ! Cease fire ! Whoo ! Pretty cool , huh ? Hey , guys . How you doin ' ? My name 's Michael . Welcome to cranston . Dear dad , it 's been 15 years since the big death wiped out everyone over the age of innocence ... The end of your world , the beginning of mine . Pretty cool , huh ? Still works great . Between what we 've got here at the base and what we scrounge up , we 've got plenty of gas . See , we 've got teams out scouting ' around , bringing back anything cool that still works , bringing back information . That 's how we found out about you guys , and the end of the world . That 's quite a name , the " end of the world . " Thing is , I hear it has another name . Because , you see , the end of the world tells me what it is , but not where it is . Now , I tried to find out from your pal Jesse , but it turned out he just sent information upriver , and not enough came back down for him to be any use to me . So , you know . Either one of you guys want to tell me what the other name is ? Huh ? Maybe you could tell me somethin ' that , oh , I don 't know , could help me find it ? Ok , that 's cool . I understand you 're not supposed to talk about it . You don 't want to tell me where your crib is . It 's ok . We 've got plenty of time . I 'll let you two get settled in , and we 'll talk later . Get away ! Just kill him . Yeah , yeah ! Kurdy ? Yeah ! This is bad . Copy that . That 's it , man . You 'll fall . I know , I know . Leave her alone ! No ! Hey , hey , come on . Give them a break , will you ? Fuck you ! No , leave her alone ! It 's a thing of beauty . What is ? The way in . Ok . I got what I needed . Break it up and get the next group ready . I want him to watch . I 'm going upstairs . I got Julie some sparklers from town . Shut the fuck up ! We need 5 more . You 3 ... You ... And you . No ! No ! And you . I thought you said 5 . Michael says you 're gonna watch . What about him ? He stays . Insurance . It 's ok . You just watch your back . You got those two ? I 've got ' em . Yes ! That 's it , Michael . Oh , yeah . Someone was excited . Oh , yeah . Oh , that 's right . We 've got ' em , Julie . We 've got 2 guys from the end of the world . This is where it starts , you know ? We take what they got , we put it with what we got , and if what I hear is true , nobody can stop us . What if they say no ? We 've just got to show ' em where the power is . Make them understand what we got , what we 're building , how far we 're prepared to go . So this was ... You know , a good day ? What do you think ? Oh , Michael ! Michael , it 's beautiful . How ... How much is mine ? All of it , 'cause it 's been a great day . Oh . Hey ... It 's gonna be ok . Is this your dad ? Kinda . I was just a baby when my real mom and dad died . This is Cindy . She used to baby-sit me . How is he ? He 's asleep . I think he 'll be all right . Thanks for helping . Yeah , no problem . So what is this place , and who the hell is this Michael guy ? He 's in charge . Of what ? Of everything . Everything here , everything in town , everything . He and his guys moved into the base right after the big death . He 's a smart guy . The place had generators and gas storage tanks , guns , grenades , rocket launchers , plastique , ammunition . Well , how 'd he recruit all these guys ? They used to be raiders working what was left of the highways . They used to spend most of their time fighting each other . Then Michael stepped up , organized them . He 's good at that stuff . They think he 's nuts , but as long as the goodies keep coming , they don 't care . That 's why we 're here . So they can take whatever we have and put us to work getting more stuff for them . Give it back to me , man . Give it back . How do we get out of here ? We don 't . Nobody does . You hear me ? Cut it ! Do you know what this is all about ? Yes . I 'm sorry . Then stop it . I can 't . Hey , how 's it goin ' ? Are you settling in ok ? Yeah , all the comforts of home . Good , good . Yeah , I wanted you to , uh , see this , give you a little better idea of what I 'm trying to do here . Check it out . Hi . How you doin ' ? I 'm Michael . Nice to meet you . What 's your name ? Jeff . My name 's Jeff . Hi , Jeff . Let me ask you somethin ' . Do you believe in God ? I , uh ... Yeah . I mean , I think so . Do you believe in the efficacy of prayer ? The ... The efficacy of prayer . That it works . It would sure help right about now . Give it a shot . Pray to God that you 're gonna get out of this alive . I don 't know what you want from me . Now , please ! Hey , what the hell ... God , get me out of this . Please , God , just get me out of here . Jesus ... I 'm sorry . Who ? Jesus . What about you ? And I don 't believe in God . You son of a bitch ! What the hell are you doin ' ? It 's all right , it 's all right . Just wait , you 'll see . And your name is ? Lisa . Hi , Lisa . Do you have anything you 'd like to say to me ? Do you believe in the efficacy of prayer ? Yes , I ... Michael , I pray to you . I pray to you for my life . I pray to you . Done . I 'm Rick . Save me , Michael . And so I shall . I 'm Adam . Save me . Where is the end of the world ? Don 't do this . Where is the end of the world ? There is no such place . Please , Michael , I pray to you . Please . Michael , spare my life . I pray to you . Do you really think God answers every prayer ? No ! No ! It 's ok , it 's ok . We 'll try again tomorrow . And tomorrow , I 'll ask you twice . The day after that , I 'll ask you 4 times . And I 'll keep doubling it every day . The number of times that God will disappoint his people is entirely in your hands . You 're free to go . You 'll have to work for the tribes , helping them find stuff , fix things , whatever . But you owe your lives to me . Never forget that . Don 't fight this . It isn 't gonna work . Someone said , " power comes out of the barrel of a gun . " I 've got all the firepower in the world right here . Hey , man . What happened out there ? Hey . What happened out there ? Michael , I have great news . I 'm pregnant . Michael , I thought you 'd want to know . I ... I 'm pregnant . Hey , Michael , guess what ? I 've got a little psycho in the oven . It looks just like you . Julie ? Did you say somethin ' ? No , no . Just clearing my throat . Hey , you 're sittin in my spot . I said , you 're sittin in my spot . Your fucking spot , you asshole ? Your fucking spot ? Here ! How about this fucking spot ? Anybody else got a fuckin ' spot ? You ok ? Yeah . You went away . I know . I 'm back . How about these guys ? They 're fine . So you got a plan ? No . No , I don 't . What do you mean , you don 't ? Your ass always has a plan . Ever since I met you , you 've got a plan for every damn thing . You don 't take a piss unless you 've got a plan . Oh , that is so not true . Yes , it is . No , it 's not . Every time you tell a lie , Jesus bleeds . Where did you come up with that ? Every time you tell a lie , Jesus bleeds . Every time you tell a lie , Jesus bleeds . Every time you tell a lie , Jesus bleeds . We 're all set . You really gonna do it ? Oh , yeah . I am . You know what they call these things ? Daisy cutters . Is that a pretty name or what ? The end of the world . They call it that , but don 't even know what it really means . It 's time to help them understand . Hey , come on , both of you . What about them ? Screw them . Get up . No . You want to try that again ? Look , Michael wants us alive and cooperative . If you pull that trigger , we are neither , and your boy Michael is really pissed off . You want to be the guy to piss him off ? I didn 't think so . So , here 's the deal . While we 're gone , you make sure nothing bad happens to those people , otherwise when we come back , we 'll just go back to being uncooperative . Ok , fine . Sure , whatever . What the fuck are you lookin ' at ? And I thought you said you didn 't have a plan . That 's as far as it went . Oh , shit . Hey . Oh , hi . Maybe I should go . No , don 't , uh ... Don 't leave because of us . Yeah . There 's somethin ' to be said for having witnesses around . I didn 't catch your name earlier . Julie . I 'm Jeremiah , and this is kurdy . How 's it goin ' ? I got the impression earlier that , uh , you didn 't like what you saw . No , it 's just ... It takes a very special kind of person to organize all this , get people to follow him , so Michael 's just very ... Complex , you know ? " Complex " is a word you use when you don 't want to say anything bad . You complex , too ? Not really . Not that complex , anyway . You know that by staying with him , you 're helping him , right ? Why do you stay with him ? Because he saved me ... Years ago . I was lost , stuck in this desert for days , and I passed out . I would 've died there , but I woke up and he was standing there looking down at me , and he had food and water ... And he said the way I lay there , I looked like an angel that had fallen out of heaven . He was younger then , different . I mean , he always knew that there was something big in front of him , you know , but he wasn 't like this . He wasn 't ... He has this image of himself , see , and it 's gotten bigger . And now , it 's like it 's almost bigger than he is . I don 't think he understands what he 's doing sometimes . But you do . And sooner or later , you 're gonna have to decide . Ok . I 've been thinking . The problem is you don 't know me , and I don 't know you . You have no reason to trust me , but I know that we 're gonna work this out one way or another . A couple of ways we can do that . First of all , just so things don 't seem so one-sided , I 'll give you something if you give me something . What 's that ? We could share information . Save you a lot of time finding out who 's gonna be a problem . There 's you guys . There 's the rocky Mountain brigade . There 's the posse commitatus from down around Montana . They 're going to be all up in your ass pretty soon from what I hear . There 's the army of the South . There 's Mitchell gang . There 's Valhalla sector . I see you 've heard of that one . Yeah , I 've heard of it . Everybody 's heard of it . What do you hear ? Enough to know that we have a mutual enemy . The old world 's dead and buried , but those fuckers , they just don 't want to get the message . They 've been arming up for a long time . Tell you the truth , I thought they were gonna come after us about a year ago , but somethin stopped them . Something scared them . The point is the Valhalla sector is a perfect example of why we should work together . At the end of the day , they 'll fight you guys just as hard as they 'll fight us . Look , why 's all this so important to you ? Because I am meant for something better . I 'm meant for something special , important . I knew it even as a child , I just didn 't know what it was , and then the big death happened . And everyone I knew died , and everyone they knew ... Died . All those people , billions and billions ... Died . And I thought : There must be a reason . And I realized the only way the big death could have happened was if God ... Was dead . And if God is dead ... Someone has to take his place , right ? I 've got my tribes , I 've got my people , I 've got believers , and I 've got a vision . I 've got a vision for the new world , and I see flags , and I see banners , and I see armies marching in my name , and it 's all right here . What ? So , like , you 're God ? I don 't know , man . I just thought you 'd be taller . No , I 'm not a God . To be a God , you have to get people to believe in you . Jesus , Mohammed , Buddha ... All the good gods started out as regular guys . They worked their way up . I mean , you 've got to start somewhere , right ? Christianity wasn 't spread by love . It was spread at the point of a sword . There were crusades . There were inquisitions . There were soldiers saying , " believe or die . " The only difference between that and this is that I 'm not gonna wait until after I 'm dead to get the ball rolling . Now , you can be a part of it , or you can be in my way . Either way ... I just need to know where you stand . And I will . Do you remember that little problem we were having in east Cameron ? Yeah . East Cameron 's a little town about 30 Miles from here , about 200 people . It 's pretty , but , you know ... Anyway , the way we keep everybody happy is to cut them in for a little piece of everything that 's going on in their area . But it seems east Cameron just doesn 't want to play anymore . Julie , is that east Cameron on the t.V. ? Yes . Look , I don 't get it . What the fuck ... This is an army base . We 've got guns , we 've got tanks , we 've got jeeps , we 've got latrines , we 've got cafeterias , we 've got mines , we 've got rocket launchers , and just like every self-respecting army base in what used to be the United States , we 've got 114 Daisy-cutter bombs . Non-nuclear , but these babies will incinerate anything within 600 yards . That 's 6 football fields , boys and girls . The hand of God . Now , I 've placed 6 of these bombs in east Cameron . Difficult for me to part with them , you understand , but I need you gentlemen to realize just how serious I am . You want to know why you should either side with me or stay the fuck out of my way ? Michael , no , please . Take a look at the future , gentlemen . It looks an awful lot like this . All I want is the truth . You withheld that truth , and a town had to die . Understand that I am merciful , understand that I can forgive , but also understand I have 108 more of those . This is so fucked up , man . I have never seen anything like ... I mean , you know , you ... you hear about stuff like that from the old world and you forget it 's there , or you figure somebody exaggerated . Yeah . This , like , all right ... You know that all these ... These armies and these navies and these marines or whatever ... If they know they 're gonna die , then on their way out , the least they could have done was gotten rid of this shit , instead of leavin ' it lyin ' around for crazy motherfuckers to get ahold of them and blow up whole fuckin ' towns . All right , Jeremiah , you know me . You know , I don 't like getting involved in other people 's problems . Yes , I know . But we 've got to take this motherfucker out , so you come up with a plan , because if you don 't , I will . Man , did you see the looks on their faces ? Oh , man , that was somethin ' else . It really was like ... Like the hand of God , you know ? I 'm tempted to cap off 3 more of those things to see the sky light up like that again . Baby , you look a little pale , uh ... Are you feelin ' all right ? Yeah , yeah . It 's just , uh ... Michael , I 'm pregnant . You sure ? Yeah . I , uh ... I told you I don 't want kids . I know , but ... Because you 're gonna love it more than you love me , and I ... I just can 't have that . No , Michael ... Well , there you go . Michael ... You 're my angel . Angels don 't have kids . She stays the night , then tomorrow ... Kill her . Promise me ... Promise me you 'll take me to the end of the world . No . I mean it . Promise me , and I 'll get you out of here , both of you . No . Please ? Tell you what . I 'll make you a deal . You get the rest of these people out of here , I 'll take you there . Anything , just take me away from here . We 're gonna need more than this , a whole lot more . That 's a good start . Hey . Open the gate . I don 't think you 're supposed to ... No ! Everybody , come on , go ! Go ! Move ! Go ! Go ! Hold up ! Wait a sec . Check it out . No shit ! All right , come on . You gotta come down . Get down . Let 's go ! Come on , go ! Go ! Run ! Kurdy , get her back to thunder Mountain . Tell Marcus what happened . Wait a second . What about you ? I 'm not goin ' . Like hell you 're not . Somebody has got to stop this psycho . You said it yourself . Otherwise , what 's to keep him from blowing up one town after the other until he gets what he wants ? What are you gonna do about it ? Let 's say even if you cap this guy , there 's still 50 other cats waitin ' to pick up where he left off . Kurdy , if you can save somebody , it 's worth it . Angels don 't have kids . I don 't think he understands what he 's doing sometimes . But you do . And I see flags , and I see banners , and I see armies marching in my name , and it 's all right here . I 'll think of somethin ' . I 'll do it . You go . I can stop him , stop all of them forever . Get in the fuckin ' truck ! She 's going with me . Come on . Ok , we know how far those trucks can go on the gas . We send everybody we can . If anyone gives you any trouble , kill ' em . Hey ... This is important . Hey , God ... It 's your angel . Dear dad , i don 't have very much to say tonight . Some days there just aren 't the words , you know ? But I think about all the other bases that must have survived the big death . How many more Michaels are out there waiting to happen ? I don 't think I 'll sleep much tonight . To tell you the truth , i may not sleep again for a long time .

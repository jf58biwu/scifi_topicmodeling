 Your favorite simulation . Just killing time . You want to spar ? As you wish . That was too easy . What 's the problem ? Where 's your concentration ? Maybe you regret taking the red pill . Maybe . It crosses everyone 's mind at least once . The wish to return to an ordinary life . A carefree life in the country . The life we had before knowing all this . Even if that life was just an illusion ? It 's ironic that one could be more at peace in the virtual world . Finally starting to warm up . Listen to me . I have something I want to talk to you about . It 's all right . I 've blocked the signal so no one else can hear us . So , what ? You gonna propose ? I 'm going back to the Matrix and I want you to come with me . Come on , be serious , Duo . Stop teasing me . I am serious , and you know it . I really thought you 'd be with me on this . Anyway , it 's done and it 's all been settled with them . What do you mean , it 's all been settled ? This is the only way . It 's just a matter of time before Zion is wiped out . Come with me . Stop it . Please do not do this to me , Duo . - We can 't . - We can ! I 've come to my senses . You should do the same . I took the red pill because I wanted to know the truth . But I don 't care about the truth anymore . What 's real doesn 't matter . What 's important is how we live our lives . Are you listening to me ? You know I 'm right . But we can 't go back , Duo . We know the truth now . - We can forget all of this . - Duo ... I know how . Trust me . Don 't be afraid to look into your heart . Say what you 're really feeling . - Tell me . - I can 't . I don 't know . Running away won 't change anything ! You 're the one that 's running away ! Stop pretending ! Enough , Duo . I 've had enough ! There 's no time . They 're on their way . You betrayed us , didn 't you ? Operator , please ! Get me out of here right now . Operator , I need an exit ! It 's no use . I told you . I 've blocked your signal . You won 't stop me . This is your last chance . The choice isn 't that hard . Come with me . You can forget about it , Duo . I won 't look away from the truth . I can 't . That 's too bad . I 'm sorry . I wanted to go back with you . - I love you . - No ! Relax , you 're okay . Easy , Cis , settle down . He was just part of the training program . He 's just a simulation . It 's over . It was a test . Judgment . Concentration . Technique . High scores on everything . Now , get some rest . You okay ? I feel a lot better now . Except for that last part I 'd say she passed .

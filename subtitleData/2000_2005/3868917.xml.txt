 She 's very beautiful . It is a pity she must die . You look just like your mother . Who are you ? You know my parents ? If this belongs to you I am a friend . - Where did you get this ? - From your mother ... she kept it wrapped in a royal blue ribbon . My mother ? You 've seen my parents ? Just a few days ago . You did ? Where are they ? The day your parents left you ... they wandered into a place called El Dorado . My father told me El Dorado doesn 't exist . Your father discovered he was wrong . Are they okay ? They are both in the best of health . And they miss their daughter every day . Would you like to see them ? More than anything . Before I tell you how to find them ... you must swear to go alone ... and tell no one where you are going . Yes I promise , I won 't tell anyone . The gateway to El Dorado ... is in the south face of the great mountain . There is a hidden door . The key to open it will present itself , but you must hurry . All right . I 'll go right away . Will you take me there ? Tell no one about this . I have found her my prince . Are you sure ? Skin bronzed by the sun ... hair the color of gold . A virgin ? Only a virgin can free me . She is the one the legend speaks of . I am certain . Enough ... we will see . Bring her to me . Yes , my prince . I have waited three hundred years for this . Does my , would be , savior have a name ? They call her Veronica . Veronica . At the dawn of the last century A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out ... of the Lost World Who are you ? What do you want ? Why are you doing this ? - Another beautiful day in paradise . - Aha . Looks that way from here . One day we might even remember it this way if we ever get back to London . Has anyone seen Veronica this morning ? It has to be . I 'll do it . Forgive me . It 's not like Veronica to miss breakfast . Maybe we should go look for her . Mmmm looks good . What 'd I miss ? - Just about everything . - Let me fix you a plate . No , it 's okay don 't worry about me . - Seems very cheerful . - Even for her . Are you all right ? I think I know where my parents went . What ? It never occurred to me until this morning . Where do you think they are ? You don 't know the place but ... I suddenly remembered something my father said and ... I 'm going to go take a look . Now ? Why not ? Take Malone with you or Roxton at least . Ready at your service . Thanks but it really isn 't necessary . I 'm not going very far . Why do you have to go alone ? You know the dangers better than any of us . Yes I do . Don 't worry I 'll be perfectly safe . What 's the big secret ? No secret . I 'm going to find my parents , I hope . Wish me luck . Wait for me . Let me come with you . - No you have to stay here . - Why , I don 't understand ? Just stay here and don 't follow me . Why ? I can 't let you go by yourself . Well done Malone . - She caught me by surprise . - I hope so . I think she 's in some sort of trouble . Why what did she say ? Nothing but before she hit me she ... She what ? She kissed me ... like she was trying to say goodbye or something . Any sign of her Challenger ? I can 't see her anywhere ... Sorry I took a little longer than expected . Are you all right ? Fine , who are you ? You know me better as a little old lady , I think . What ? She 's a sweet old thing but not much good in a fight . You and her are the same person . Messenger and friend . Your parents are waiting , come . You 've seen my parents again ? They can 't wait to see you . How do we even know this is Veronica 's trail ? Broken twigs kicked stones we could be following a dinosaur for all we know . You didn 't have to help Marguerite . Do we even know for sure that she 's in trouble maybe ... she just wants to spend some time alone . Okay now which way ? - That way . - How do you know ? Because that way leads back pass the treehouse . Maybe that 's the point lead us in a circle then double back . Maybe but , maybe not . I guess we better split up . I 'll go this way . Don 't worry if she 's not there when I get back ... to the treehouse I won 't stop . If we pick up her trail we 'll send a smoke signal . We 'll do the same thing . - What is it ? - Ambush . Whatever he says , don 't listen to him . He 's lying . Go ! Your parents are waiting ! You hear that ? Thank God you tried to follow her . You have to help . - Who are you ? - It doesn 't matter . Your friend has been deceived . - What friend is that ? - The one who kissed you goodbye . Three hundred years ago ... a giant and his minion were sealed inside the great mountain . - A giant ? - Yes ! your friend is the only one who can release him . Why her ? Because it is written in the great oracle . A maiden from another world will come ... and she will free him and he will glory ... in his savage vengeance . Veronica was born right here . But her parents came from far away ... just like yourselves . The last time he was free he slaughtered thousands . This time it will be much worse . - I have to stop her . - No , No ! You 've had a very bad bump on your head ... - you better rest . - I 'll go find Veronica . Hurry please . Veronica wait ! I told you not to follow me . Who told you this is where your parents are ? A messenger . She had proof ! What kind of proof ? I just want to talk about it . What if you 're wrong ? What if you 've been tricked ? Please ! Let her go ! I 'll put him somewhere safe . Oh your poor head . I 'll miss you . Hurry ! He won 't be out for long . Hello ? Is anybody here ? Who are you ? I 'm prince Apep ... sealed in this tomb by evil magicians . For three hundred years I have waited ... and dreamt of your touch . What are you talking about ? Only you can save me from eternal darkness ... you my future queen . I don 't understand ? Where is El Dorado ? And where are my parents ? Back and forth across this damn jungle ... Veronica better had a good explanation for all this . What 's going on ? And where 's Veronica and Malone ? - Who 's under the rocks ? - And who the hell is this ? She and her mate were trying to stop Veronica . She says her mate was killed by a Shape shifter . Shape shifter ? No it can 't be . Malone ? - I couldn 't stop her . - No ... it can 't happen again ! - Wait Qinaq where are you going ? - Forget about her . We 've got to find Veronica . - What , you 've seen her ? - Yeah , just before some guy with a long curved sword and ... a head like a hammer knocked me senseless . The giant 's minion ? - Giant ? - According to Qinaq ... a giant and a shape shifting minion ... have been locked in a mountain for three hundred years . And Veronica is the only one who can set him free . The messenger said this was the gateway to El Dorado . I 'm the gateway to El Dorado , the prince and heir to the throne . And you ... you are to be my queen . I 'm not your queen . But I am looking for my parents . And you will find them . When you return with me to the golden city ... your parents will be waiting . Prove it . The only way for me to prove it is to take you there . - How far is it ? - Not far . Are you sure my parents are really there ? Yes I swear , with all my heart . Now if Veronica let a giant out of these mountains don 't you think we would 've seen it by now ? Are you saying here is no giant ? There she is . Well , hello prince charming . Veronica ! What happened are you all right ? I 've never been better . This is Prince Apep ... he 's going to take me to see my parents . I thought you were supposed to be a giant ? That is the story told by the ones who imprisoned me . But as you can see I 'm just a man . Where are your parents ? They 're in El Dorado . - There 's no such place . - It 's just a legend . El Dorado is as secret to the outside world as this plateau . A lost world within a lost world , sounds terrifying . It 's paradise and no one who lives there ... ever wants to leave . And you 're going there right now ? - Can we come with you ? - Unfortunately ... - we must go alone . - Why is that ? Those who know the way cannot return . That 's how the secret is preserved . Once I find my parents I 'll send for you if you want . You 're leaving ... forever ? Are you sure about this ? I think you should reconsider . I 've waited eleven years for this . Try to find some way to keep in touch . I never thought I would be the one leaving . I have to find my parents , just like you have to find your way back home . Maybe I 'll drop that and follow you . Ah a prince and a city of gold . Where did I go wrong ? Misplaced values ? Why are we stopping here ? El Dorado is a full day 's ride from here . Our friend needs some rest . Relax but don 't go far . Come , I have something I want to show you . Just as I left it . Three hundred years ago ? Our friend outside 's been looking after things . You see ... I 'm immortal a descendent of the gods . And I shall rule El Dorado for eternity . Our time together may be brief Veronica , but it shall sparkle with more brilliance ... than all the stars in the midnight sky . And through our children you too ... shall live forever . Children ? Beautiful children , yours and mine . Qinaq said there was a giant . Why would she lie ? Apparently to keep a handsome prince locked up . It could be that she and her dead partner are the bad guys . - I don 't believe it . - Then why did she run ? We should have gone after her . I 'm with you two , I 've got a bad feeling about this . Men , she has fallen in love . You can 't protect the little girl forever . Don 't be afraid just close your eyes . - I can 't . - Yes you can . But I don 't even know you . I am your prince . No ! Don 't you see what I 'm offering ? You said you would take me to my parents . And I will . But why deny your feelings ? Are you refusing me ? Are you lying to me ? Haven 't I been kind to you ? What is this ? You dare pull a knife ... on me ? You could have been my queen , now you must die . I will not be scorned . - What happened ? - What do you thing ? she 's escaped . Find her . Where are you going ? We don 't know exactly . We 're hoping to pick up their trail . And follow them to El Dorado ? I wouldn 't mind a glimpse of that fabled city . If that 's where their going . He 's not , that guy was lying . Male intuition . Veronica ? Lies ... everything ... . lies . He got so ugly . You mean he turned into monster ? Right after I made it clear I wasn 't going to sleep with him . That son of a bitch . Typical , not a wonder you had to walk home . Are you saying he actually grew into some sort of giant ? - Bigger than a T-Rex . - Qinaq she was right . - Where is he ? - I don 't know he didn 't follow me . - But he 's got a friend . - The Shape shifter . Which means he could be anywhere at any time . Qinaq would know how to stop the giant . That 's right she would remember from the last time , we have to find her . Lead the way . There 's a ruined village not to far from here , - We 'd better get moving . - Maybe we should all go . No wait , somebody has to defend the treehouse . We 'll only be gone a couple of hours . You 've got three hours before we come looking . Make it two and a half . All right Challenger what 's your plan ? The perimeter fence won 't stop him ; he 'll step right over it . I was thinking of something a little closer to home . Looks pretty deserted . Qinaq are you here ? You know yelling might not be such a good idea ... the giant might be closer than we think . You learned the truth and he didn 't kill you . He tried to , just like you . We had no choice . You could have told me what was really going on . Would you have believed us ? For the rest of you life you would have been tempted to look behind that door ; just to see if your parents were there or not . The question is do you know how to stop this monster ? Yes ! This plant it has a poison in it that ... will poison him for a couple of hours . - It won 't kill him ? - Nothing will kill him . But if we get enough poison into his body maybe we ... can get him back to the mountain before it wears off . That 's your plan ? Haul a giant back to a mountain ! We 'd better get started . This should slow him down . At least until he figures out it 's all connected to the windmill . Let 's hope that 's long enough . I know what the giant said ... about your parents . He told me they were in El Dorado . But now I know there is no such place . But there is . This ... this was once the golden city . This ? What happened to it ? Three hundred years ago the queen was seduced by a demon ... and a giant was born . When he grew to be a man the people refused to accept him as their king . And in his anger he destroyed the city . But after he was captured El Dorado was moved ... to a secret place . Not even the giant knows where it is . It is possible your parents found it . But how can that be ? - Wouldn 't you know for sure ? - Oh . I have not been to El Dorado in many years . My purpose is to guard the dungeon . But when this is over I will take you there . We can search for your parents together . - Care to test it ? - Ha ha . Sounds like you may have a volunteer . Perhaps a bullet or two will slow him down . Oh . what evil device is this ? Throw down Veronica ! We 're going to run out of ammunition before we stop this behemoth . Ready or not . What 's next in the arsenal ? Challenger . Here he comes . Nice place . Hope I 'm not intruding . - She isn 't here . - What ? She must have slipped out when I came to get you . I 'll be back for you ! The minion must know where Veronica is . Did you hear something ? Run ! Put me down ! - You 're not Veronica . - And you 're no prince ! Beg for your life . Oh ... tell me when it starts to hurt ? What kind of a sick degenerate are you ? A very hungry one . Is that the best you can do ? Open your mouth I 'll blow your tonsils off . At last a woman with a sense of humor . Oh you think that was funny ? This should be hilarious . For that I 'll have to bite your head off . Find her ! For now , I 'll just amuse myself with you . There . - What 's happened ? - She 's dead . Oh thank God . Well , I mean where 's Marguerite ? The giant took her . What ? We 're wasting time ; we have to get these plants back to the treehouse and extract the poison . Well thanks for the lift . Change of clothes . You night find something suitable in there . What a beautiful bed , pity you 'll be sleeping on the floor . That isn 't very funny . I think it is and a man as big and tough ... as you should be able to laugh a little at himself . Well ... the next thing you say better be hilarious . Quit making threats . How can you laugh when you 're so angry all the time ? No wonder they locked you up for three hundred years . Strychnosis Toxifera ... an excellent source of Curare . It 's a fast acting drug that relaxes the muscles to ... the point of paralysis within seconds . Too bad it wears off . It 's going to take a lucky shot ... a vein in the neck or the back of the thigh . Here try it . I 'm aiming for his eyes . The eyes ... yes that 's ideal . The more poison we get into him the faster he 'll fall . That giant doesn 't stand a chance . I 'm here to entertain and make you laugh . - How do I look ? - Tiny . Why don 't you come down to my size ... and see how perfect tiny can be . You 're a lot more fun than the other one . That 's for sure . Virgins are highly overrated . You know when I saw you the other day ... you looked so handsome . I thought to myself some girls get all the luck ... such strength , such beauty . I wanted to be the one to hold you , caress you , make you forget about the horrors of your life . That would be nice . Well , what can a woman of perfectly normal proportions do ? We could have been lovers . Can you feel it ? Can you image just ... how delicious that would be ? God help him if he 's laid a hand on Marguerite . Veronica , are you sure about this cave ? I don 't know where else to look . Look at you , mountain of a man ... totally useless . You think if I were small like you , you could out smart me maybe even kill me . No I thought you were immortal ... I am . Then what are you afraid of . You would be the mother of my children ? Mother to a brood of monsters ? Who could say no to that ? You know I 've always imagined myself more ... courtesan then mother . But ... what the hell , how bad can it be ? Monster children could be fun . I 'm ready when you are . My old friend . That 's the cave behind him . What are we going to do about him ? He 's mine . You deal with the giant . - Veronica , wait ! - Malone no ... the giant first . We 'll probably only get one shot at this , so make every dart count . Ready ? How did she do that ? Incredible . I think I 'll go help Veronica . Are you as wicked as you pretend to be ? Oh far more than you ever could have imagined . Show me . Why are you in such a hurry ? Three hundred years is long enough to wait . You 're right let 's not wait any longer . Don 't stop now . What have you done to me ? I am Apep ! No , it can 't end like this . Is that better ? It was for me ? You seduced a giant ? Oh it was nothing ; it 's just like any other man . Sorry about the deception . So am I. Tell me have you ever really seen my parents ? In a jewelry box in the treehouse . There are some pictures . You prying son of a bitch . I wouldn 't if I were you . Shoot her . You wouldn 't shoot a poor old lady would you ? Malone she 's got a knife . I 'll see you again sometime . Not if I can help it . Is it dead ? Don 't know . You moved that slab of rock with your finger ? That must weigh a thousand tons . I just hope you can get it closed again . Come on . One two three . Right just bring him around now . Down now . Might as well give him the rest of this Strychnosis huh ? - Allow me . - Oh no ... pleasures mine . Come on just hurry it up . What are you doing ? Damn it did you have to wake him up ? Fiends ! I will avenge myself ! There it is . - So much for prince charming . - Actually ... he was quite charming when he wanted to be . Sorry we interrupted you . Yes I 'll bet you are . You must be running out of ink by now . No one will believe me unless I capture all the details . Before anyone outside this treehouse ... reads the details ... I want editorial approval . As soon as you become my publisher . You know Marguerite , you really must ... be more careful about the company you keep . You know , for all the strange things we 've encountered here ; it amazes me that we have ... never really found out what happened to Veronica 's parents . Didn 't you hear ? It 's possible they really are in El Dorado . What ? The fabled city exists ? According to Qinaq it 's somewhere right here on the plateau . She didn 't say where ? Unfortunately she didn 't live long enough to point the way . So now all Veronica has to do is find a fabled city of gold . It 's probably right next to the doorway out of here . Wherever it is ... I 'll find it . * *

 - That 's a bold move . - I live on the edge . Nice work , dumb-ass . I 've given thought to moving off the edge . Not an ideal location . - Make it a place in the middle . - A toast ! Toast ! Quiet ! Shut up ! I 'm ... I got words . I 'm saying , this is an auspicious day . We all know what day it is . Suspicious . What day is it ? A glorious day for all the proud members of the allied planets . Unification Day ! - Yeah . - Yeah . The end of the scumbag Independents and the dawn of a new galaxy . Yeah ! Captain . Just feel the need for another drink . What month is it ? Hey , you gonna drink to the Alliance with me ? Six years today , the Alliance sent the browncoats running pissing their pants . You know , your coat is kind of a brownish color . It was on sale . You didn 't toast . You know , I 'm thinking you 're one of them Independents . I 'm thinking you weren 't burdened with an overabundance of schooling . Why don 't we just ignore each other till we go away ? The Independents were a bunch of cowardly , inbred piss pots . Should 've been killed off of every world spinning . Share that to my face . I said , you 're a coward and a piss pot . - Now , what are you gonna do about it ? - Nothing . I wanted you to face me so she could get behind you . Drugs are so cute . - Jayne . - Hey , I didn 't fight no war . Best of luck , though . Fine . Let 's do this . Wash , we got some local color happening . A grand entrance would not go amiss . Is Jayne even awake ? There 's just an acre of you fellows , isn 't there ? This is why we lost , you know . Superior numbers . Thanks for the reenactment , sir . Hey , hey , them ain 't kosherized rules . I 'm thinking somebody needs to put you down , dog . What do you think ? I 'm thinking we 'll rise again . Every man there , go back inside or we will blow a new crater in this little moon . Damn yokels can 't even tell a transport ship ain 't got no guns on it . " Blow a new crater in this moon " . My thanks , Wash . - Nice save , as always . - A pleasure . - And how are our passengers ? - They 're fine . So , what happened ? Was there a terrible brawl ? - There was . - Are you getting my wife into trouble ? What ... ? I didn 't start it . Just wanted a quiet drink . Funny how you always find yourself in an Alliance-friendly bar ... This is another sign of your tragic space dementia , all paranoid and crotchety . Breaks a heart . Did we at least make a contact ? Ladies and menfolk , we have ourselves a job . Take us out of the world , Wash . We got us some crime to be done . River . River , it 's okay . It 's me . You know who I am ? Simon . Were you dreaming ? - Did you dream about the Academy ? - It 's not relevant . If you can talk about what happened there ... I know it 's hard , but the more I know , the faster you 'll get better . This isn 't home . No . No , we can 't go home . If we go home , they 'll just send you back to the Academy . This is safer now . We 're on a ship . Mid-bulk transport . Standard radian accelerator core , class code 03-K64 . - Firefly . - Well , that 's something . I can 't even remember all that . - You need a weave on that ? - It 's nothing . I expect there 's someone 's face feels differently . They tell you , never hit a man with a closed fist but it is , on occasion , hilarious . I suppose so . So the fight didn 't draw any attention ? No Feds . Just an honest brawl between folk . None of us want the Alliance on us , doctor . That 's why you 're here . I thought I was here because you needed a medic . Well , not today . Mal . " Bad " in the Latin . - Shepherd Book . - Captain . How 's the girl ? Still a little whimsical in the brain pan . Seems calm enough , though . - That young man 's very brave . - Yeah . He 's my hero . He gave up everything to free his sister from that place . Go from being a doctor on the central planets to hiding on the fringes of the system . - There 's not many would do that . - I suppose not . There 's not many would take him in , either . Why did you ? Same reason I took you onboard , Shepherd . I need the fare . Neither of us can pay a tenth of what your crew makes on one of your jobs . Are you referring to our legitimate business enterprises ? I 'm wondering why a man so anxious to fly under Alliance radar would house known fugitives . The Alliance had her in that institution for a purpose , whatever it was . And they will want her back . You 're not overly fond of the boy . So why risk it ? Because it 's the right thing to do . Oh , would you look at this . Kaylee ! I 'm wondering if you know why you 're doing it . What about you ? How come you 're flying about with us brigands ? Shouldn 't you be off bringing religiosity to the fuzzy-wuzzies or some such ? Oh , I got heathens aplenty right here . If I 'm your mission , Shepherd , best give it up . You 're welcome on my boat . God ain 't . Where the hell 's that girl ? - Do you want me to put it up ? - No , that 's okay . You have such lovely hair . I 'm sure the doctor would agree . Who , Simon ? He 's much too ... I mean , I 'm just ... - Do you think it looks better up ? - We could experiment . We might even get wild later and wash your face . You ever do this for your clients ? Very occasionally . Not all of them have enough hair to get a brush through . Have you ever had to service a really hideous client ? With boils and the like ? A companion chooses her own clients . That 's Guild law . But physical appearance doesn 't matter so terribly . You look for compatibility of spirit . There 's an energy about a person that 's difficult to hide . You try to feel that ... Then you try to feel the energy of their credit account . It has a sort of aura . What did I say to you about barging in ? - That it was manly and impulsive ? - Yes , precisely . Only the exact phrase I used was , " Don 't " . You 're holding my mechanic enthralled . Kaylee , what 's going on in the engine room ? Were there monkeys ? Some terrifying space monkeys maybe got loose ? I rewired the graph thrust . Somebody won 't replace that compression coil . Get the place squared away . It 's dangerous in there . And I ain 't paying you to get your hair played at . We work before we play . - You 're servicing crew now ? - In your lonely , pathetic dreams . What do you want ? - May have a job . - Congratulations . On a decently civilized planet where I could screen some respectable clients ? Respectable clients , that seems a contradiction . Don 't start . There 's ... We haven 't got a location yet . We 'll be landing on a skyplex in a bit , run by a fellow called Niska . - Never heard of him . - Well , I have . While we 're there , you 'll stay confined to the ship . Is the petty criminal ashamed to be riding with a companion ? This guy has a very unlovely rep . He 's got work for me , fine . But I don 't ... I 'm not sure you 'd be safe . Mal , if you 're being a gentleman , I may die of shock . - Have you got time to do my hair ? - Out . Is fine . Crow , they can come in . - And Malcolm Reynolds is which ? - I 'm Capt. Reynolds . - My first mate Zoe . This is Jayne . - Very nice . I am Adelai Niska . You have seen Crow . He loves to stand at the door to say , " Boo " . We got word you might have a job for us . Yes . Yes , an exciting job . A train has something I need . - You have worked a train before ? - We did a few . Are you going to ask me what it is I need ? As a rule , no . Yes , good . You have reputation . " Malcolm Reynolds gets it done , " is the talk . Well , glad to hear that . You know what is reputation ? Is people talking , is gossip . I also have reputation not so pleasant , I think you know . Crow . Now , for you , my reputation is not from gossip . You see this man ? He does not do the job . I show you what I do with him and now my reputation for you is fact . Is solid . You do the train job for me then you are solid . No more gossip . Right . Oh , you do not like I kill this man . Oh , no , I 'm sure he was a very bad person . My wife 's nephew . At dinner , I 'm getting earful . There is no way out of that . So ... Oh , the train job . Come in . Here , in fifth car , two boxes . Alliance goods . You don 't mind the taking from Alliance , I think , from your reputation . You get on train at Hancock headed for Paradiso . You take boxes off before you reach Paradiso and deliver to Crow here . Half money now , Crow give you other half at rendezvous point . Anything goes wrong , then your reputation only gossip and things between us not so solid . Yes ? - How long till we hit Paradiso ? - 20 minutes . We should be in the foothills in five . Let 's get to work . He 's a psycho , you know . Niska . He 's not the first psycho to hire us , nor the last . You think that 's a commentary on us ? I have an image of a guy hanging from the ceiling . I got an image of it not being me . Let 's do the thing . Hi . Shepherd . Good day . So how do you think it 's going ? - The caper ? Mal knows what he 's doing . How long have you known him ? I 've been on the ship eight months now . I 'm not certain I 'll ever actually know the captain . I 'm surprised a respectable companion would sail with this crew . It 's not always this sort of work . They take the jobs they can get , even legitimate ones . The further from the central planets , the harder things are . This is part of it . I wish I could help . I mean , I don 't want to help ... Not " help " help . Not with the thieving , but ... I do feel awfully useless . You could always pray they make it back safely . I don 't think the captain would much like me praying for him . Don 't tell him . I never do . Go on . Straight through . Keep moving . Sir , is there some information we might maybe be lacking as to why there 's an entire Fed squad sitting on this train ? - It doesn 't concern us . - It kind of concerns me . They 're not protecting the goods . If they were , they wouldn 't let people past . - Think that changes the situation a bit ? - I surely do . It makes it more fun . Sir , I think you have a problem with your brain being missing . Come on . We stick to the plan . We get the goods . We 're on Serenity before the train reaches Paradiso . Only now we do it under the noses of 20 trained Alliance Feds . And that makes them look all manner of stupid . This job I would pull for free . - Can I have your share ? - No . - Lf you die , can I have your share ? - Yes . Hey . Oh , hey , doctor . You really should just call me Simon . Oh , I 'll do that then . So what are we doing ? - Oh , crime . Crime ? Good . - Okay , crime . - It 's a train heist . You see , we fly over the train car , the captain and Zoe sneak in we lower Jayne onto the car , and they bundle up the booty and we haul them all back up . Easy as lying . - They 've done this before ? - Hell , no . But I think it 's gonna work . The captain gengish when it comes to plans . Is there anything I can ... ? Something I should be doing ? Staying the hell out of everyone 's way . No call to be snappy . Are you about to jump onto a moving train ? - The captain ain 't around . I 'm in charge . - Since when ? Just because Mal says you 're medic , don 't make you part of the crew . Just play at figuring what 's wrong with that sister of yours till we call for you . Right . You shouldn 't be so rude to him . - Because he 's all rich and fancible ? - He 's not rich . The Alliance crashed his accounts when he snuck out his sister . Yeah , we could all be rich if we handed her back . - You 're not even thinking that . - Mal is . - That 's not funny . - He ain 't stupid . Why would he take on trouble like those two if there weren 't no profit in it ? Captain 's got a move he ain 't made yet . You 'll see . Time for some thrilling heroics . Niska 's sources better be good . Shining . Find the cargo . All hail the great Alliance . Aha ! Fifteen seconds . - Go ! - Go . Go now ! Come on . - Where are the others ? - They shot my gorram leg . Are they still on the train ? Are they gonna be okay ? Everybody off ! Come on , everybody off ! Our man didn 't get a look . Well , jeez , can someone find out what they took ? Keep those people together . Quiet them down . It 's medicine , sir . All of the supplies . They stole the gorram medicine ? We been waiting ... - All of it ? - Every ounce . God help us . Son of a bitch . - What 's the fuss ? - All network alert . Cargo theft . Medical shipment lifted off a train en route to Paradiso . Six crates of Pescaline D. That will get you a tidy fortune on the black market . Tag it received . Bounce it back . Locals can deal with it . Sir , there is a regiment holding in Paradiso . They were headed to the installation . Then get them back on the train . Who 's holding them there ? The sheriff requested we deploy if you 'd help ... These are federal marshals , not local narcotic hounds . They 've got better things to do . So do we . Gorram it , let 's get us moving . Now , I 'm not finished . - This ain 't the rendezvous spot . - It is now . - Niska 's people are not partial to waiting . - Let them read a magazine . We don 't make the sale until Mal and Zoe are back . These are stone killers . They ain 't cuddly . I 'm not flying anywhere without my wife . She 'll be okay . She 's with the captain . There , you see . Everybody wins . Doc , I need a pop to quiet this pain some . All right , but what about the authorities ? We 're sitting here with stolen Alliance goods . Won 't they look for us ? They buzz this canyon , we 'll hear them before they see us . - We 're good ... They 'll never stop . They 'll just keep coming until they get back what you took . Two by two hands of blue . Two by two hands of blue . How about you shut that crazy mouth ? Is that a fun game ? I 'm in charge . I 'm telling you how it works . We don 't get the goods to Niska , he 'll make meat pies out of us . I ain 't walking into that . Is this Adelai Niska you 're talking about ? Now , how would a shepherd know a name like that ? As I 've heard it , he made a deal with the captain . If the captain 's not there to finish it , if Niska finds out he 's being held and may speak as to who hired him I think we 're better off being a little late . - This is a nightmare . - Nothing points to us yet , sir . That ain 't what I 'm talking about . Whatever happens , remember I love you . Sir ? - Because you 're my wife . - Right , sir . Honey . Car three , row twelve . Mr. And Mrs. Raymond ? Can you tell us what 's going on ? We 've been here for so long . - Did someone on the train get killed ? - No , no , no , nothing like that . Says there your fare 's paid for by a third party ? My uncle . It was a wedding gift . Wedding gift . - Spending your honeymoon in Paradiso ? - Actually , we 're here looking for work . That right ? My uncle said he knew a Joey Bloggs out here . Said he might have an opening . Thought we 'd try our luck . You a miner by trade ? Either of you ? Not really . Haven 't seen many folk choose this life weren 't born to it . Well , work is real scarce for a couple just starting out . How come there 's so many sick here ? Bowden 's Malady . - You know what that is ? - An affliction of the bone and muscle . - Degenerative . - Very . Every planet that 's been terraformed for human life has its own little quirks . Turns out the air down underground mixed up with the ore processors perfect recipe for Bowden 's . Everybody gets it . Miners , dumpers . Hell , I got it , and I ain 't ever set foot in a mine . - But it 's treatable . - There 's medicine . Pescaline . You can live like a person if you get it regular but our shipment got stole right off the train you was riding in . Which is why you won 't be seeing a parade in town today . Stolen ? Didn 't I see an entire regiment of fine , young Alliance Federals on the train ? You did . Same regiment let their medicine get swiped from under their noses then took off for their own camp without so much as a whoopsy daisy . That sounds like the Alliance . Unite all the planets so that everybody can be interfered with or ignored equally . Alliance ain 't much use to us out here on the border planets . But they didn 't steal the medicine . I ever find those people , they ain 't ever gonna see the inside of a jail . I 'm just gonna toss them in a mine and let them breathe deep for the rest of their lives . Can 't argue with that . You mind telling me when it was you last spoke to Joey Bloggs ? - Never did myself . - Right . Your uncle . And it was indicated to you that Joey had an opening ? Any job would do . It 's funny your uncle never mentioned the Bowden 's problem or that Joey Bloggs ate his own gun about eight months back . Did he ? Yep . Blew the back of his head right off . So would his job be open ? We waited long enough . Let 's get this bird in the air . - No way . - You really should sit down . We can 't leave the captain and Zoe . They ain 't coming . We can 't get them . They 're done . Fire it up . - What 's going on ? - We 're taking off . - We 're not . Captain would do the same . - Not in a million years . - Listen to me ... Know what the chain of command is ? It 's the chain I beat you with till you understand who 's in command . Now , we 're finishing this deal . Then maybe we 'll come back for those morons that got themselves caught . You can 't change that by getting all bendy . - All what ? You got the light from the console to keep you ... Lift you up . Oh , they shine like little angels . - Did he just go crazy and fall asleep ? - I told him to sit down . You doped him . It was supposed to kick in a good deal sooner . I just didn 't feel comfortable with him in charge . I hope that 's all right . So how do we get the others ? If Jayne was right about them not making contact they got pinched getting off that train . We can 't just waltz in and pull them out . Someone respectable enough might be able to . - What the hell ... ? - Don 't you dare speak to me . Sheriff , I want this man bound by law at once . - That 's assuming he hasn 't been already . - No one 's been bound . Not yet . Thank God you stopped them . Did you think you could access my accounts and I wouldn 't find you ? And , Zoe , what would your husband say if he knew you were here ? I was weak . - So I take it they ain 't newlyweds . - Hardly . Malcolm 's my indentured man with three years left in his debt . I imagine we 'll have to add another six months after this little adventure . You 'll have to pardon them . Don 't think one of them 's ever seen a registered companion before . - I apologize for my manner . Oh , not a bit . Should I contact my ship ? Do you need to hold them much longer ? Looks to me like we 're about done here . We had some unrelated trouble . His story had kind of an odor to it . Yes . It 's not the only thing about him that does . Thank you very much , sheriff . Come along . That 's a hell of a lady . - Her files were all in order ? - I read them twice . All right . Let 's get started with the rest then . - Hey . How 'd it go ? - She hit me . We tried to get him into the infirmary . He 's just heavy . - Engine 's running . We 're good to go . - We 're not going . - Not what ? Not why ? - We 're bringing the cargo back . What ? What do you mean " back " ? I waited for you guys . What are you talking about ? What about Niska ? Won 't this put him in a killing mood ? - Others need this more . - Let 's get it on the mule . - My shuttle 's faster . - You risked enough flying in there once . I don 't want to get slapped around no more . We 'll explain to Niska that the job went south when we return the money . If you want to explain , now 's your chance . You didn 't make the rendezvous . We ran into a few complications . You are thinking of taking Mr. Niska 's money and his property maybe . Interestingly , neither . - I don 't understand . - Yeah , look , here 's what it is . Deal 's off . We changed our minds . You entered into an arrangement with Mr. Niska . - There is no mind-changing . - That 's where you 're wrong . We just can 't take this job , so you just relax . We 'll get you the money Niska gave us , you return it to him , we 'll call it even . There is no even . Is that right ? Nice shot . I was aiming for his head . We 'll have to drag them from here . Leave them just off the street notify the sheriff once we 're in deep , deep space . Why not tell him in person ? Got word of a ship not far out . Came looking . Didn 't expect to find you coming back . Didn 't expect to be coming . Nothing missing . You were truthful back in town . These are tough times . A man can get a job he might not look too close at what that job is . But a man who learns all the details of a situation like ours , well then he has a choice . I don 't believe he does . Let 's get these crates back to town . Make ourselves useful . Now , this is all the money Niska gave us in advance . You bring it back to him , tell him the job didn 't work out . We 're not thieves . But we are thieves . The point is , we 're not taking what 's his . We 'll stay out of his way as best we can from here on in . You explain that 's best for everyone , okay ? Keep the money . Use it to buy a funeral . It doesn 't matter where you go or how far you fly . I will hunt you down , and the last thing you see will be my blade . Darn . This is all the money ... Oh , I got it . I 'm good . Best thing for everyone . I 'm right there with you . - You should 've let me do this sooner . - I 've had plenty worse . It 's just ... Ow ! - Sorry . - Just be careful . Pretty fast thinking , doping up Jayne . - Can 't say you made a lifetime friend . - I 'll deal with him . Yeah , I 'm not too worried about you . How 's your sister ? The same . In one moment , she seems perfectly cogent . The next she speaks nonsense . It 's like a child . So difficult to diagnose . I still don 't know what the government was trying to do with her . So I have no idea if they succeeded . Hands of blue . Two by two hands of blue . - Sorry to keep you waiting . There 's ... - We 're not interested . We 're here about a theft . The medicine on that planet . Word came up that was returned . We didn 't fly 86 million miles to track down a box of Band-Aids , colonel . We 're looking for a girl . This girl .

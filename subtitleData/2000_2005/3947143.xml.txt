 I 've been waiting . The Ouroboros restored . For your master . My half of the bargain . At last I can return to the plateau . And this time no one can stop me . - This way . - Veronica ! - Veronica ! - Veronica , wait for us ! We 've lost her again . This way . - I can 't keep this up all day . - Looks like we don 't have to . That 's it ? She ran out this morning saying she knew where to find her parents . She 's been led astray before , but this is the first ... time she 's been told where to go by a dream . Maybe this time it will be different . Veronica ? What is it ? When I woke up this morning , It was as if my mother 's pendant was ... guiding me ... telling me ... I 've been here before ! You have ? When ? It 's that Trion thing . The Eye of Heaven . What is she doing with her pendant ? Well , that was a whole lot of nothing ! - Veronica ! - Uh ! At the dawn of the last century A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out ... of the Lost World Here ! Her pulse is steady and strong . Then why doesn 't she wake up ? And why is that thing still glowing ? Veronica ! Veronica ! Veronica , is that you ? Sounds like there 's someone in the jungle . Maybe I 'm wrong . Maybe ... it 's just a silly little monkey ! Mom , I 'm not a monkey ! I 'm an Avatar warrior ! Veronica , who told you about the Avatars ? Assai ! She tells me all the Zanga magic stories . The Avatars are everywhere , watching everything on the plateau , and if little kids aren 't careful , they 'll come and steal them away ! Now I don 't want Assai giving you nightmares ... about make-believe stories . There are no such things as Avatar warriors . And no one is every going to take you away from daddy and me . No one . I think we should take her back to the treehouse ... where Challenger can examine her . I say we bring Challenger back here . Until we know what 's happened , it may not be safe to move her . Don 't look at me ! I mean , what ever it is that knocked Vee out , at least it put a smile on her face . Daddy , we 're getting closer now ... and I 'm certain I saw it here , Over by that tree ! Here it is ! - Are you sure ? - Hypercallum perferatum . just what mom 's been looking for . Very good , Veronica . You 're going to make a fine botanist one day . Yeah . But nobody 's better than mom ! She 's one of a kind all right . Let 's do your lessons . You pick . - Do the rules . - All right . Rule number one : What do you do when an adult says ' Danger ' ! I do what I 'm told . I hide or run . And I don 't make a noise until the battle is won . Good girl ! Now it 's my pick . Do the 12 times table . - Dad ... - Come on now . 12 times 12 is ... ? 12 times 12 is 144 . 12 times 13 is ... 156 . 12 times 14 is ... a dinosaur with a wooden leg ... right ? - Veronica , danger ! - Run or hide ? Neither . Not yet . There 's something out there but ... not sure if it 's ape men or ... There ! I wouldn 't fool around with that , Finn . Well , maybe we should . I mean , the second Vee touched this to the stone , she went out like a light . What 's your point ? Well , if this is like some kind of switch or something , then maybe we should try and turn it off ! The sooner the better . Veronica 's not smiling any more . You have no right to be here . We made an agreement with your leaders . The Protector is dying . No . No , that 's just a legend . It was never true . - The line must be preserved . - No ! Daddy ! Stop it ! Leave my father alone ! Daddy , who is he ? He 's an Avatar warrior . But mom says Avatars aren 't real . No questions , Veronica . Tell him to get out of our way . - Tell him , Veronica ! - Get out of our way . Now tell him not to stop us . Don 't stop us ... and don 't you dare follow us ! Good girl ! Your mom will be proud of you . Daddy , why did he have to do what I said ? - Am I magic ? - There 's no such thing . Now come on . We have to hurry . Careful , John . Well , there 's definitely some source of energy connected to it . Challenger 's found lines of energy running all through this plateau . Yeah , well we found another one , I guess . Got it ! Any change ? Nothing . That 's that , then , I 'll get Challenger . Marguerite , wait . Now , Roxton , you go with her . Okay ? I can take care of myself and Veronica . All right , I 'll be back with Challenger soon . It 's okay , Vee . I 'm right here . I wish I knew what was going on in there . Hey guys , are you all right ? - Yeah , I 'm okay ! - Abigail ! - Abigail ! - Daddy , what happened ? - Mr. Layton ! - Lewis ! Where 's Abigail ! ? Speak , man ! Veronica , go untie the other men . Let me know if anyone 's hurt . Now what didn 't you want to say in front of my daughter ? Avatar warriors attacked us . More than we could count . - They took Abigail - It 's the only reason they stopped , sir . She gave herself up to save us . It 's not your fault . I 'll round up the men . We 'll find her , Mr. Layton . You wouldn 't know where to look . But I do . Where ? Get the balloon uncrated and ready for flight . I 'll be back as soon as Veronica 's safe . Struggle and you die . Where is she ? The Protector ... I know she is near . - Answer me ! - Never ! The line must be preserved . Not by you it won 't . She cannot escape me this time . Don 't worry , Veronica . If anyone can work out what 's doing , it 's the big guy . As soon as he gets here you 'll be fine . Finn ? Vee ! You 're okay ! Where am I ? Well , you got a shock , and they went to get Challenger . - I had the strangest dreams ! - Yeah , well I 'm not surprised . I mean , once you stuck this in the stone , you got zapped ... pretty bad . Zapped ? Vee , the shaman that gave you that pendant ... must have known what was going to happen . I think he set a trap for you . No , not a trap . A message . The men said that Avatars came and took Mom away . I 'm going to bring her home in the balloon . You knew about the Avatars . Mom said they weren 't real , but you KNEW they were ! - And now she 's not safe . - Veronica , I 'm not going to let anything bad happen to you or your mom . That 's why you 've got to stay with Assai at her village . You knew about the Avatars , and you lied to me ! So all of a sudden , you 're ... having all of these memories you never had before . It 's as if I 've always known just ... never remembered . Well , don 't leave me hanging , I mean , what happens next ? See you at the clearing . Is this where the warriors came ? Who are you ? This stronghold ... where is the woman who lives there ? You 'd better wait until the boss comes back . Not just any woman , the Protector herself . Tell me where she is . I don 't know what you 're talking about . She wears a pendant at her throat . A pyramid of light rising from the storm . I 've never seen anything like that . Whosoever wields the Eye of Heaven controls the plateau . You know who I mean ! Help ! Go warn Layton ! This man is after his wife ! So the protector has a mate . From the treehouse ! Veronica ! Veronica , danger ! - Run or hide ? - Hide ! Now ! I 'll protect you , Edward , You 'll be safe . Lewis ! Lewis ! 8 times 80 ... - is one hundred ... - It 's safe , Veronica . It 's safe . Daddy , why were they shooting ? Ape men ! We have to keep moving . This isn 't the way to Assai 's village . The Zanga are peaceful people . We need more powerful friends . The protector has a child . Do you think Veronica will ever really find her parents ? I hope so ! Even discovering their fate would bring her some peace . How old were you when you were adopted . Oh , no more than a year . Would I be prying if I asked another question ? Yeah , probably , but that 's never stopped you before ! Do you think it will ever be the same between us ? You can 't deny there was ... well there is a , a something , you can call it what you will ... a closeness , a connection . Is this the man who was voted the most ... eloquent speaker in the House of Lords . No , this is the man ... Marguerite , don 't you shut me out here ! I never let you in , Lord Roxton ! Yes , you have ! More times than you know ! You don 't even know if my real name is Marguerite . Neither do you . What ? Marguerite , wait ! Marguerite , I didn 't mean it like that ! I 'm sorry . Please ... Look ... Marguerite is the name I know you by . If you want to be called Madge , Adrienne , or ... just plain Jane , I don 't care ! I know who you are . I know the courage you displayed during the war ... when no one else could know your identity ... and I know the fierce resolve that brought you on this plateau . I also know the strength and friendship that you 've shared with all of us , as well as the disappointments you 've had to bear alone . So that 's who you are to me . So whatever name you choose , by ... whatever terms you care to mention ... - I love you , Marguerite . - No , you can 't , John . I 'm sorry , but you just can 't ! Why not ? - Why ? - For a thousand reasons . I don 't care what secrets you still have ! I do ! I do ! This is really bad timing . - Who the hell are you ? - Right place , wrong woman . You 're not the one I am looking for . The Ouroboros ! That 's it ! That 's Xan 's medallion ! You know about Shanghai Xan ! Of course ! You 're the fabled Miss Smith ! The one Xan told me about . You came so close to getting this for yourself ... Having all your questions answered . And then ... You lost everything . I asked for you to identify yourself . I 'm not going to ask you again ! You 're right , you 're not . Too little too late , Miss Smith , Xan told me you excel at making deals . So you and I shall make one now . Give me the location of Veronica Layton , and I will let you keep your life . Miss Smith , you hesitate . Xan told me you value no one 's life higher than your own . You must have me confused with somebody else . A variation then . The Layton girl for this man 's life . I don 't know who you are ... Who I am is Mordren . What I am exceeds your comprehension . Exceed this ! Xan told me you were a student of the Ouroboros . As long as I possess this , your weapons cannot harm me . But for your ignorance , his death shall be slow and his suffering immeasurable . - No ! - Damn you ! Shoot him now , Marguerite ! Marguerite ! Roxton ! Good heavens ! What was all that shooting ? - Veronica 's in danger . - We 'll explain on the way . Vee ? - Vee ! - Sorry , I ... . It was more than a dream . It was as if my father was really there . Really where ? And where did he take you next ? - Safe ? - Safe . I 'll be just ahead . You stay right here . Safe . Here I am ! Come out ! We don 't need secret signals , Diana . If my acolytes discovered I was dealing with a man ... as an equal , they would rise up against me and end my rule . I know what you Amazons do with your men . You are set apart from other men , Thomas Layton . - I 'm not important ... - No man is . - But my daughter ... - It 's more important ... - than even you can know . - I do know . Why else do you think I sent you that message to ask you to meet me here ? You are offering your daughter to us ? No ! Yes . No , not yet . But if I don 't come back ... I have to know that Veronica will be safe . How can she be otherwise ? She is the child of this plateau . We will permit nothing to harm her . Her mother was born here . - Our lady protector . - And she has been harmed . - How ? - Taken against her will ... - to Avalon . - Avalon is ... where the protector belongs ! We had an agreement . My wife wouldn 't go there until our daughter came of age . The leaders of Avalon agreed to that when Abby and I were married . This plateau must have a protector . Abigail 's mother is dying . It 's time for Abigail to take her place . We had an agreement . So you are going to Avalon to try to get her back . And if I can 't ... if anything goes wrong and I don 't make it back ... I need to know that you 'll watch out over Veronica . At our village ? Until she comes of age . When that time comes ... if it comes ... joining you will be her decision . On my honor , the line of the protector shall be preserved . All I want is for my wife and my daughter to be safe ... and with me . I will wait for your return , and I will slay them both . and then Diana came for me . And that was the last time I saw my father . I can 't even remember the last time I saw my pop . But up until now I ... I remembered it differently . I mean ... I ... I can still remember my father telling me ... all the members of his expedition had been killed by ape men . I can still see my ... parents leaving for their Sunday walk ... just to gather samples ... and then they never came back ! But now I know that 's not what happened ! It must be like Malone and his memories of the war ... I just refused to remember ! I mean , I wasn 't honest with myself ! But some of these memories , you just told me you weren 't even there to see . So I 'm making it up ? I 'm lying to myself all over again ? No , you 're not , I think you 're right the first time . Someone is sending you a message . My mother ! Do you think she had something to do with putting that symbol on the stone ? The shaman said it was my time to know . This must have been what he meant . Time for you to know the story of your life . And what really happened to my parents . Where did you come from ? Ask Veronica . She couldn 't possibly forget who I am . And when I say danger , Edward ... you have to say , 'run or hide . ' And you have to do what I tell you . Ready ? Daddy ! Diana ! Diana ! Dad 's found Mom ! I saw his balloon ! It 's been almost six month , Veronica . Dad promised he 'd come back ... - with Mom ! - I hope you are right . Though I will be sorry to see you return to your treehouse . You have the makings of a fine Amazon warrior . I don 't want to be a warrior . You are your mother 's daughter . - Daddy ! - Veronica ! Daddy ! Mom ! Oh , I 've missed you so much , Veronica . Our lady protector . I 've missed you so much . Mom ? There 's something you need to know , dear heart . You came to say good-bye to me . Oh , Veronica , I have so much to tell you ... how I left the plateau to explore the world beyond ... how I met your father ... and fell in love . I brought him back here so that we could share our life together . More than anything , that 's what I longed for ... an ordinary life with your father . And for you , the life of an ordinary little girl . Are we magic ? No . But we are so much alike my love . You were born on the plateau , just as I was , and my mother and her mother before her . All of us the same , children of the Plateau . And each of us , when our time comes ... protector . The role of the Protectors is finished . The Plateau is mine . Mordren ! Who 's Mordren ? Who is he , Abigail ? His line is the reason ours exists . I don 't understand . That which our line protects ... his would destroy . He must be the one who killed Lewis and the men ! You 'll have to take Veronica , She 'll never be safe with that man here ! Angel , go with your mother . - I love you ! - Daddy ! Thomas , no ! - I love you , Veronica ! - Daddy ! Go to Avalon ! - Get out of my way ! - Leave my family alone ! Daddy ! Wait ! No you don 't ! I said leave them alone ! You cannot stop me . Daddy ! You ! You murdered my father ! He stood in my way . Finn ! Leave her ! She is of no concern to you or me . You ... murdered my father ! That day , he kept me from you and your mother . He gave you time to go to Avalon , and she sent a thousand avatars against ... me to drive me from the Plateau ! My mother is still in Avalon ? Only until I kill you . Then she 'll come after me ... and with the Ouroboros shielding me , I will finally kill her too . We 'll never outrun someone who can travel by magic . However this character used the Ouroboros to get here , his supposedly magical appearance has to be ... covered by a rational scientific principle ! After 3 years on this bloody plateau , I think I 'm safe in saying no , it doesn 't . Let 's save that debate for back at the treehouse . Why are you doing this ? The Plateau belongs to me ! Not as long as I 'm alive . You won 't be for much longer . Give me the Trion . - My mother 's Pendant ? - Soon to be mine . It belongs to me ! Give it to me ... or you shall watch me dissect ... this woman , nerve by nerve ! No . Give it to me ! You can 't take it , can you ? I have to give it to you ! - No ! - I won 't ask for it again . Okay ! It 's yours ! After you answer my questions . Please tell me that came from behind us . No such luck Over there . Do you think it saw us ? Run ! I 'll distract him . We run when you run . Now is not the time to be stubborn , George . Exactly . Now may we run ? - Stop ! - John ! - Go ! Veronica needs you ! She needs all of us ! Come on ! In there ! I don 't suppose there are any more magical medallions around here . As far as I know , there is only one . Do you have any idea where the Ouroboros comes from , Marguerite , or who made it ? Legend says it 's as old as the two fundamental forces of creation . The two fundamental forces of creation ... electromagnetism and gravity . No , George ! Good and evil ! How does my mother protect the Plateau ? You don 't know ? My friend says it 's a gathering point ... for lost worlds , lost time , lost lives . Your friend is a fool ! The Plateau is not a collector of life ! It is the source ... of everything ! - What ? ! - The power ... that courses through the lines of this Plateau ... is the power to control life itself . The Protector denies it ... to those who can use it best ! You . Is he really leaving ? So soon ? There is only one creature more impatient than a hungry T-Rex . Lord John Roxton . It 's all clear ! He 's run off . Then so shall we . No more questions . The Trion or this woman dies ! You touch her , and I swear you 'll never take another breath . I am protected by the power of the Ouroboros ! Nothing you can do can harm me ! No ! I 've been waiting for this fight all of my life . So do I. Give me the Trion , Veronica , The Plateau is mine ! NO ! Never ! Veronica ? Now I remember everything that happened here . Daddy ... I found you . All of the members of The Layton expedition finally accounted for . Why did they come here in the first place ? My father wanted to build a life here with my mother . He loved it here . Called it paradise . In a way it is . It killed him , Challenger ! He died to save you and your mother . No one could love you anymore than that . I just wish I could remember the rest . What happened in Avalon , how long I was there until my mother ... brought me back to the tree house ... Why she left me ? She just wanted you to have the life that she couldn 't . A normal life . You 're the protector of this Plateau , Vee . What IS that ? I don 't know , Finn . Now Veronica knows her mother is alive . She 'll eventually learn everything she wants to know . Wherever this place called Avalon might be , perhaps we can find it . I don 't think Veronica needs to search for her mother any more . When it 's time for me to do whatever it is I 'm supposed to do , I know now that you 'll come to me . *

 Jake Foley was an ordinary guy until a freak accident transformed him into the world 's first computer-enhanced man . Millions of microscopic computers interface with his biochemistry and make him stronger and faster , able to see and hear farther than normal men . They give him the power to control technology with his brain . Jake Foley - America 's secret weapon . He takes on missions no ordinary agent can perform . He is the ultimate human upgrade . I gave you a chance to do this the easy way . Now , sooner or later , you 're going to tell me where that bomb is . I 'm going to count to three . Three . Oh , you think you 're tough ? Oh , you think you 're a bad-ass ? Think again , pal . Remind me never to piss you off . It 's time . - Already ? - Yep . Ooh ! This is a very serious matter concerning the personal safety of all 46,000 NSA employees . The workplace is not in home . There are rules that govern your behavior ... Will you just take one and pass ' em ? Oh , but I collect seminar pamphlets . Each of us is entitled to a safe and harmonious work environment . But it is our - all of our-responsibility to maintain that balance . Now , if somebody is doing something offensive , you have to speak up . Be sure to say no . If you smile or act unsure of yourself ... Would you feel harassed if I took this seat ? Oh , maybe a little . We 'd all like to be able to joke about it , pretend it isn 't a big deal . Please don 't sue . I doubt it 's actionable . I 'm sure you all have places that you would rather be , but if you just give me your undivided attention for half an hour , I will try to make this as painless as possible . So , if you could please open your pamphlets to section number one : " Unwanted advances and lascivious eye contact . " Now , as cited in Title VII , the relevant section civil rights act of 1964 , a " person " is defined as one or more individuals ... Yeah , I 'll be going for the E6 field promotion . Yeah , they can say California is theirs all they want . It still belongs to us . Satellite remote . No , honey . The big gray one controls the tivo ... Yo quiero mas informaciones acerca de la siete quinze de diciembre . Me gusta mucho ... We 've got a problem . Echelon monitor over Europe 's detected a scrambled call . - What are they using ? - I 've never seen it before . Some sort of crystal logarithmic device . - Initialize decryption . - It 's already running . Record and process . We 'll see if the boys in crypto can make anything of it . - Right away . - What 's the source ? A mobile phone . Triangulating now ... Vienna , Austria . # in untranslated Polish I don 't know ... I 'm sort of in the middle of something . I 'm talking about 5 million . - Hmmm . - 5 million . Is that American dollars ? Of course , American . Give me day to tie up loose ends . I 'll be in DC on Monday . Mr. Lowenstein ... I 'm afraid I have unfortunate news . I 'm not going to be able to do this as thoroughly as I had hoped . I 'm deeply sorry ... about the rug . That 's me . Jake Foley , I 'm in Tech Support . Security Clearance : Low . Very low . Then one day , it all changed . Life just got real interesting . So , want to catch a bite after work ? - That sounds great . - Okay . - Well , I 'm off to catch the bad guys . - Hmm , have fun . Good weekend ? Yeah ! Very good . You ? Oh , pretty uneventful . I laid around on my couch , watched a little football . Well , a lot . I don 't know . I think I may have watched all the football . What-what 'd you do ? Oh , I went out to Wolftrap to see Alicia Keys . - With who ? - Uh , well , you haven 't met Steve Clemens ? No , no , I haven 't had the pleasure . Oh , he 's in cryptology . He 's ... Eccentric ? A little bizarre ? I was going to say , uh , " nice . " Hey , does he wear one of those colanders on his head to keep out the brainwave scanners ? I 'm not making this stuff up . Those code-breaker guys are weird . Yeah , and do they exhibit classic antisocial behavior like never leaving their couch all weekend ? Hey , Sarah , we 're finally talking . I know , just when I was starting to develop a relationship with your voice mail . Yeah , you guys are getting pretty close . We are . He knows just when to beep . Uh , a little predictable , though . Yeah , I 'm sorry . Things have been crazy around here , but , uh ... I 've wanted to talk to you . Me , too . Uh ... look , I-I know it 's short notice , but my boss gave me his tickets to the Saint Sebastian 's Fund-Raiser tomorrow night . I know it sounds kinda lame ... No , no , you kidding ? I love the Saint ... Sebastian 's fund-raiser . - So , I 'll meet you there , then ? - Okay , sure . I 'll talk to you later . Bye . C 'mon , I have a job for you , Mr. Roboto . " Mr. Roboto ? " You 're dating yourself , Kyle . Sounds like a dying hippo . It 's actually a next-generation encryption program . So far , it 's stymied any attempt to unscramble with logic software . It 's kind of like a lock that changes shape whenever you put a key in it . We were hoping you could interface with it , and ... - Ask it to be a little less difficult ? - Yeah , something like that . I 'll give it a shot . Sorry , it 's still gibberish . No , it 's not . It 's Polish . Oh . His name is Vasily Koronkiewicz . According to the telephone conversations we 've intercepted , it 's highly probable he 's in the DC area . This man is an efficient , dangerous mercenary who specializes in abduction . He 's been high on Interpol 's radar since the disappearance of the Belgian consul last April . Human trafficking . Nice guy . Capturing Vasily is our highest priority . I want his 20 by the end of the day . So ? We gonna go shake down some snitches ? Jake , please . I haven 't even finished my coffee . - Transcription from linguistics . - Thank you . " Narodowy ? " There 's no translation for this word . Oh , uh , here . Let me . Uh , National Bank of Poland . There 's a Branch on Florida Ave . Hey , can you tap into their security cameras ? I can if he tells me to . Run Vasily 's photo through facial ID for the past 12 hours . All right . What are we missing ? What haven 't we thought of ? Well ... there 's always LaFortunata . What 's LaFortunata ? Why don 't you show him ? Speak only in short , terse phrases . Under no circumstance are you to engage , got it ? What is this ? The dungeon where you keep the Pig Boy ? Oh , oh , let me call you right back , all right ? I got some company . I know . I know . Will wonders ever start ? Okay . Okay . Keep your chin up . - Seymour . - Mr. Duarte ! Do I hear that clarion call ? Oh , my country needs me ? Just put that stuff anywhere . Vasily Koronkiewicz . Uh-huh , uh-huh , uh-huh . He 's a heavy , heavy hitter . I was hoping some of your people might know who put him up to bat . Okay . Uh , yeah . Have a seat . Let me make a few hundred phone calls . Uh , yeah , we 're on kind of a tight schedule , Sy . Whatever you can do ? Thanks for your help . Yeah , no need to front-load the gratitude , boys . I haven 't worked my miracles yet . Eastern European crime factions , Asian triads , the guy on the corner with a pop gun under his jacket . Economic globalization has turned it into one neat , big web , but the spider feels every little ripple . Uh-huh . And ... you 're the spider ? I could write a book ... if I hadn 't signed a foot of paper promising that I wouldn 't . Between you and me , I started anyway . You must be Jake . - Yeah . How 'd you know ? - Seymour LaFortunata . Interpersonal liaising , as I 'm sure Mr. Duarte has informed you . Apprehension of the unicorn killer , Ted Kaczynski , Mufari Allis-Khan ... ringing any bells ? You helped capture all those guys ? No , of course not , don 't be ridiculous . Wink-wink , nudge-nudge . Kid 's a little green , isn 't he ? Little slow on the old uptake . - You read my mind . - You see ? You see that ? You see that , Jake ? That , that is my magic . I read people . Gonna have to cut this short . Facial ID 's got a hit . - Vasily was at the bank . - Wow . It was nice to meet you . Really nice to ... You , too . You , too . Go get ' em . Maybe this could refresh your memory . I 'm sorry . I can 't help you . Tell me , Mr. Harcourt , would you prefer we wait until this guy 's already committed a crime ? You have reason to believe that the immediate seizure of the financial records in question is necessary to prevent the death of or serious bodily injury to a human being ? We wouldn 't be here otherwise . Then pursuant to chapter 21a , subchapter 1 , Part A of the unlawful acts section 2000-Double-A , you should have had no trouble obtaining a subpoena duces tecum . Do you have a subpoena for me ? I left it in the car . You understand these are extraordinary circumstances . In the time it would take for us to petition a judge , very bad things could happen . And none of us want that on our heads . In the absence of a subpoena , you can have the IRS issue an administrative summons vis-a-vis the bank secrecy act . How about you just blink once for yes ? Harcourt ? What ? If I were to open up a checking account here , what would I get , like a free toaster ? We 're done here . Yes , we are . Thanks for all your help . I knew I brought you along for a reason . Vasily received a wire transfer for $ 500,000 in cash . Thanks to Jake , we have a routing number . So , we should be able to track it back to the source , figure out who hired him . Well , why would a pro like Vasily risk being paid in cash on American soil ? He needs the money to complete the job . I want to know who 's footing the bill . I want to know what he 's buying . And most importantly , - I want to know where he is . - I 'm on the routing number . I 'm on it now . I 've got your number . One routing number , seven hours , 153 dead ends . I feel like my eyes are bleeding . I mean , actually bleeding . Are my eyes bleeding ? Uh ... no . All systems normal . No complications with the nanites . Aren 't you even going to do your penlight thing ? You don 't need an exam , Jake . You gust need to unplug . Do something without computers before you get permanent rasterburn . Why don 't you ... see a movie ? A movie ? You mean one of those big , bright things you sit and stare at for two hours ? Oh , sorry . Bad suggestion . Just do something with a human . You want to come over and play Boggle ? What ? You 're human . Yeah . Um , I-I would like to , but I ... - Steve . Hi . - Hey , Hughes . Um , uh , Steve Clemens , - this is Jake Foley . Jake ... - Hi . How you doing , Foley ? Hi . Never better . So , I 'm thinking dinner at Maggie 's . What do you say ? - Mmm . - White pizza . - Freakishly white , still tangy . - Mmm . Uh , why don 't you come , too , Foley ? I 'll buy the first pitcher . Oh , you know , I had dinner last night . And , uh , the whole novelty 's kind of worn thin . - So , you sure ? - Yeah . Yeah , you guys go ahead . Like I was telling Diane , I just feel like crashing out . Or working all night . Hmm . Where are you hiding , Mr. Vasily ? Oh , hey . Looks like I 've got a match . We 've already got four teams out chasing possibles . Let 's take this one . Corner of 6th and F. Do you even really need to sleep ? I mean , with those nanites and all . No , Kyle . I just plug myself into an electrical outlet for a couple of minutes , and I 'm good to go for the day . Hey , I 'm just asking . I have no idea what it 's like to have ... Kyle , I 'm still human . Okay . I understand . So when you jog , do you hear that slo-mo running sound from the six million dollar man ? The one that goes - do-do-do-do-do ... You 're dating yourself again , you know that . Hello . What do you think he 's got in the bag ? $ 500,000 worth of unmarked nonsequential bills . This is Agent Duarte . We have target confirmation on Sixth and F. Requesting backup . He looks anxious . Any sign of the mark ? No . Damn . Hey ! You all right ? - Yeah . - Oh , god . Oh . Emergency , we have an agent down . Repeat - we have an agent down . - Thank you . - Excuse me . - Miss , hold on a second ! - I 'm Dr. Diane Hughes . - I got to get to the med lab right away . - I need to check your bag . Here , keep it . The nanites accelerated hemostasis tenfold . Fiberglass are already proliferated in position for a collagen synthesis . - That 's amazing . - So , what 's it feel like ? Feels like a freak on parade . It 's not the circus , people . You got a lot of guts , Jake . But if it weren 't for the nanites , I 'd be stuffing them back inside of you . What 's the situation ? Give me the bullet . Mainly superficial damage . Slashed through the primary derma . Penetration was minimal . No organs were punctured . An inch deeper , though . Can he get back to work ? If it 's nothing too strenuous . He should be as good as new in a day or two . Glad to hear you 're okay . Thanks . Sat Ops in 15 . - We need to run a full diagnostic . - I did . Careful . Platelets ? BP ? - He checks out . - I 'm fine , Diane . Jake , I am so sorry that I was not here . It will never happen again . Late night ? - Kind of , yeah . - You and Steve ? Yeah . We caught a midnight show of the " Long Hot Summer " after dinner . Huh . What ? Nothing . What ? Well , it 's just , you guys are moving kind of fast , aren 't you ? Excuse me . Lab . Steve , hi . Maybe not . You 've got the accent way wrong . Yeah . Orson Welles was a lot more mumbly . Guess I 'm fine then . It 's not like I was stabbed or anything . More like a slash , really . Kind of like a big paper cut . No . The nose , the nose , the whole fake ... except for the knife . prosthesis thing . No . It was so fake . It was better than Nicole Kidman 's schnoze in ' The Hours ' . Are you kidding ? No , no , no . I 'm not a Lee Remick man . I 'm a Joanne Woodward man . Hi . Yeah . Sweep teams covered a four-block radius , but no further sign of Vasily . We lost him . Yeah . I sure put the fear of god into him . You should have seen the blood stain I left on his sleeve . - That won 't come out , you know . - Any progress on the wire transfer ? We traced it to a corporation in Warsaw , but it 's a shell within a shell . Jake ? Oh , yeah . I got it right here . Okay , pay dirt on Corporation Number 156 . Coming up as publicly held , but the only name generated is " Wladimir Sticj " . - Who 's that ? - I don 't know . But I 'm going to find out . LaFortunata ? Yeah . LaFortunata . Brave man . It 's hard work . Novel approach , Jake . I still hit the wall . Yeah . Yeah , well , I will knock it down for you , my friend , all right ? I admire your tenacity , Jake , but , I ... oh , but , hey , hey , I would stick as close to home base as you could if I were you . Last guy who got his hands on Vasily - Karl Devereaux at MI-5 - ooh . Ooh . What ? What about him ? Vasily cut off his hands , and sent them to Karl 's wife for Christmas ... along with a nice fruit cake . Yeah . I 'll keep that in mind . Hey , you 're-you 're the field agent , right ? Despite your lack of a shoulder holster . What 's-what 's up with that ? Anyway , Jake ... never mind . You know what ? None of my business . It 's fine . I 'll find out soon enough about your guy . Keep your chin up . Jake . Okay . Hey , Sarah . Jake , you made it . Hey , you look ... What 's the word ? Fantabulous . Thanks . So do you . Uh ... So , um , what do you want to do first ? Well , uh , let 's do the gambling thing ? I 've got a little money burning a hole in my ... Diane ? Hey . Hi . - Hi . - What a surprise . Yeah . Hi , Sarah . - Hi . - Uh , this is Steve Clemens . - He 's my , um ... - He works with us . And apparently has an uncanny radar for where the fun is . Steve went to St. Sebastian 's . So , um , he was , uh , all city guard and-and-and high honors , right ? I told you that in strict confidence . I 'm using everything I can to get her to like me . Well ... So ... Anybody for basketball ? Yeah , yeah . Let 's go . Steve 's really good . Thanks . I mean , yeah . What ? Do I have something in my teeth ? Oh , no , no , no . I just ... it 's a little embarrassing . I ... when I first met you , I-I thought there was , uh , something between you and Jake . Really ? No . No . We work together , and you know how those things are . Those worlds - they don 't mix . They collide . Right . Business and ... Sorry . Sorry . But , uh ... but you and Steve work together ? Yeah , but he 's in a different division . And you and Jake are in the same division . Exactly . So , uh , I.T. is in the same division as , uh , medical research ? No . No , no . That wouldn 't make any sense . Uh , did I say ' division ' ? 'Cause really in the NSA , it 's more like , um , like-like ' wings ' . No , thanks . Nice going . Thanks . Ooh , look what Steve won . So you and Diane - pretty sudden . I know . She 's great , isn 't she ? So , you guys are friends . Has she said anything about me ? No , not really . It 's a winner ! Thanks . Steve , you can 't keep winning everything . I don 't have enough room on my bed . You can make some room . Hey , uh , test your strength , fellows ? - No , thanks . - Come on . Sure . Sure . Come on , Clemens . I 'm buying . Here you go . All right . Now , there 's a strong man . Nice . Okay . Here goes nothing . Oh ! Foley ! You 're a beast . Uh ... winner . Are you all right ? Cheater . Woo ! Churros . I 'll treasure it always . Um , so what do you want to do next ? Uh ... Is something wrong ? Uh , Sarah , I have to go . I 'll call you . What ? Hey , Clemens , have you done any field work ? - Just basic training . Why ? - You know what a code nine is ? - Yeah . - Call it in right now . Code word , Vasily . What 's happ ... ? No . No ! What are you doing ? - I 'm saving your ass . - He 's already down , man ! Yeah . Okay . Open it up . Why don 't you guys go get yourselves some coffee ? I didn 't think to bring you any . It 's a diuretic . Yeah , that would be problematic given the sparse modern confines of your new home . I 've been in worse . I 'm glad you approve . Since twice you 've assaulted an agent of the United States Government , I doubt you 'll be seeing the outside world again for another ten to fifteen years minimum . Oh , now that 's got to bother you . Must be really tough not having any people around to kidnap , huh ? Foreign diplomats , British Intelligence ... Are you going to torture me , or are you just going to talk me to death ? No . We don 't torture prisoners in this country , no matter how much we might like to . That 's a shame . I find pain to be the most effective way of getting what you want . Is that why you tried to hurt my friend , hmm ? To get something from him ? I cannot believe you tried to take him down alone . Thank god Steve had your back . Yeah . This is healing nicely . You know he 's getting a commendation . We 're going to go out and celebrate tonight . Even talk of making him an active field agent . Diane , they don 't just make anybody agents , okay ? Don 't be jealous , Jake . There 's plenty of room here for two heroes . Yeah , and only one of us is paying alimony . Go figure . What are you talking about ? Steve 's divorced . Yes , I know . He told me . They married right out of college , and she ended up loving her job a little ... more than she loved him . Did ... he didn 't tell you this . Have you been checking up on him ? Oh , please . Come on , like I don 't have enough to do ? I 'm analyzing money trails . I 'm pursuing ... dangerous ... mercenaries , uh ... come on . Okay , okay , maybe I took a little peek into his personnel file . Oh , I cannot believe you . Me ? Diane , me ? Diane , why is a crypto guy carrying a gun to a carnival ? Oh , Jake , half the people in this building carry guns . Half the people in this country carry guns . - There 's something wrong with him . - Oh , no , there is something wrong with you . You 've lost the ability to relate on a personal level . Oh ... that is not true . Yes , it is . You don 't even leave your house all weekend . You go out , and you 're completely awkward . I saw how you were with Sarah . Oh , god ... I ran out on her . I totally forgot . Do you see ? What is going on ? All right , we kissed , like , a week ago , okay , and-and ... I don 't know . Well , isn 't that a good thing ? I mean , you-you 've liked this girl ... forever . Diane , I have millions of microscopic robots running around inside of me . Please tell me what the next step in this relationship is , because I have no clue . I mean , the best I can hope for is that I don 't lie to her , because she can never know the real me . Nobody can ever know the real me . Nobody except you . Jake ... I 'm here for you . I 'm not going anywhere ... but you got to stop cutting yourself off from everybody else . There is life outside this building . - Anything ? - Nothing . I 'll keep at it , but I don 't think he 'll give up his bosses . - No good for the rep . - Lafortunata called . - He says he wants to talk . - Yeah , and talk , and talk ... - I 'm on it . - I 'll go with you . Bless you . - Hey . - Hi . Sarah , I-I am so sorry about last night . - It was work . This thing came up ... - Jake stop . I get it . You do ? Look , we kissed ... and it was nice . Yeah , yes , it was . I don 't think either of us expected there would be something there , but there was . I felt it , and I thought you felt it , too ... but you don 't have to keep coming up with these stories to cover the fact that you 're ... hesitant . I 'm not . I 'm not . It 's ... I don 't want to wreck this . I don 't either . But I need to know how you feel , Jake . I need you to be completely honest with me . You want me to be honest ? Totally . Vladimir Sticj . Your boy Jake put me onto him . Not of any prominence , really . He , uh ... tended bar at the beer hall putsch in 1923 , spent the last 40 years buried in a less than ornate grave at the Bierkel cemetery . - I don 't follow . - Just wait for it . Now , technically , this guy is the sole shareholder of the same corporation that hired Vasily . One of my fraternity brothers - Boola-Boola - has a-a cousin who opened a transistor factory in Gdansk . Now , he says that this " corporation " is actually a front for local mafia , mostly , you know , ex-KBG and whatnot . Well , why would a local syndicate send a mercenary to DC ? Well , because ... because they 're-they 're obsessed with cutting edge technology - most recently , nano-technology . Vasily was commissioned to retrieve a human subject to get them in the nanotech game . Now , if you guys know anybody , you know , who fits that bill , now , I would recommend getting him well-protected - they got deep , deep pockets . It is not going to end with this Vasily character . Welcome . You 're welcome , guys . You guys ... stop by any time . Wow , uh ... that-that 's unbelievable . I ... I don 't know what to say . There 's nothing you can say . I mean , really - you can 't tell this to anyone ever . So , let me get this straight , um ... you 're a secret agent at the NSA , and ... there-there are these tiny robots ... Computers , really . Microscopic computers . They 're self-replicating , feed off ... Uh ... yeah , t-tiny robots . And-and they got inside you , and , uh , now you have these , um ... superhuman abilities . Okay . I-I know this is a lot to take in , but I felt like ... well , I just ... I-I needed to be one hundred percent ... I just asked you to be honest with me , Jake . Sarah ... You know what ? It 's been a blast . At least I didn 't lie ... Do you have to be so dramatic ? ! Get in ! You got lucky . Vasily was hired to retrieve a human subject linked to the nano-technology . - I don 't get it . - Jake , he 's here for you . What ? That doesn 't make any sense . He could 've had me ... twice . Why didn 't he take me ? Let 's ask him . Okay , wake up , Sleeping Beauty . I got some more questions for you . Hey . You got a dead prisoner in there - you want to tell me what the hell happened ? - That 's impossible . - No . No . No ! We searched him completely . No unauthorized personnel has been in there . Then what authorized person has ? The last visitor was ... Steve Clemens . What ? Diane 's new boyfriend . He 's a dirty agent . He 's working with Vasily . Once we caught him ... Steve had no choice . He couldn 't let him talk . He cut out the middleman . He 's going to finish the job , and give them exactly what they want : An expert on nano-technology : Diane . So ... you 're not going to tell me where we 're going ? Uh , I told you ... it 's a surprise . Okay . Bring up the feeds for all metro intersection cameras and toll booths . Steve Clemens took the black duffel out of the evidence locker . Diane isn 't answering her cell or home phone . Oh , no , she 's with him . Cross-check with Steve Clemen 's license plate . - What 's the number ? - A DC plate , 4BMH359 . Come on ! - Where ? - Key Bridge into Virginia . - When ? - About fifteen minutes ago . Re-task all available eyes in the sky . Start tracking sequences . I want a pinpoint . Oh , my god . Steve . - Hope you like boats . - I do . A friend of mine chartered one . Turns out he 's not going to use it , so I thought we could take a little pleasure cruise . - And I 'll cook you dinner . - Ooh . - How 's that sound ? - I think it sounds very romantic . Oh , I 'm glad you think so . What 's the status on the vehicle . Clemens ' vehicle is stationary . Two miles east on 60 , royal avenue exit . Copy that . Jake , nothing 's going to happen to Diane . You pissed ? Very . Good . Fan out , fan formation . No one fires unless fired upon . Oh , Steve . This is so fantastic . Let 's go , let 's go ! - Jake ! - You okay ? - What are you doing here ? ! - Where is he ? ! I 've got the champagne . - Foley . - It 's okay . - You shouldn 't be here . - Steve ! Why don 't you tell her why you really want her , huh ? What 's going on ? Sorry , Diane . I really like you , but you can 't imagine how much they 're paying me . Jake , turn the boat around . Oh , that 's not going to happen . Jake ! - Are you okay ? - Yeah . Lousy . Ugly . Lying . Bastard . Lone . Only . Lonely . Solo . Sadly , badly and madly . That 's all I got . It 's your turn . Okay , uh , I have , um ... " tush . " That 's it ? Oh , uh , and , um ... " tush-y . " - I guess you win . - Hmm . Again . Whoo-hoo . Oh , god , I feel like such an idiot . Hey , could have happened to anybody . Yeah . Not just anyone allows themselves to get wined and dined and sold into white scientist slavery . Well , that just , uh , proves how special you are . Yeah . I guess I should have listened to you . You were just trying to save me from the world 's most pathetic breakup . Well , second most pathetic . I win that one , actually . I guess sometimes people , they don 't want to see the truth even ... when it 's sitting right in front of them . Yeah . Do you think you can take me ? Oh . Well , I-I don 't know if I can compete with your ... brain . Oh , yeah ? You weren 't even trying . Well , apparently the only word you don 't know is " mercy . " I didn 't see that one . Seriously , Diane , y-you have an amazing mind . Yeah . Why can 't I find a guy who 's just after my body , huh ?

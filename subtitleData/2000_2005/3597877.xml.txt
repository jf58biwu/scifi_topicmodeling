You start tomorrow . I 'd invite you to have a drink with us , but Nestor hates you . They 'll rent you a room upstairs . I don 't have any money . First month 's salary . Don 't try and leave town . This mean anything to you ? Not a thing . Other than that you have silver in your pocket and you still ask me for money . I 'm a marine . AD Skinner , Agent Scully , what 's this I 'm hearing about Mexico ? This came in last night from US Customs . It 's from a security camera at the border crossing in Laredo , Texas . It was taken at 12.50am on the morning of the fourth . Sure it 's Doggett ? It 's been scanned to Reyes . She also believes it is him . I 'd say this reshapes the investigation . It 's our first solid lead . With your permission , I 'd like to extend our task force south of the border . I 'm not extending the task force . I 'm disbanding it . - Excuse me ? - l see no other choice . The past 12 days , I 've had 40 agents working overtime , scouring the entire state of Texas - in what appears to be a waste of effort . I can 't move them lock , stock and barrel into Mexico . Not on the strength of this . Turn it over to the Mexican federal police . - Doggett 's in theirjurisdiction , not ours . - He could be injured . Whether you believe it or not , I want to find him as badly as you do . But the fbi 's resources are already taxed by national security concerns . There are political realities I have to account for . Sir , Agent Reyes is still in San Antonio . She was raised in Mexico . She could offer the federal police some on-site help . She can help them all she wants . But from this side of the border . Mr Molina , you 're a hard man to get an audience with . I 've been trying for the better part of two weeks . What 's keeping you so busy ? Selling tractors. I own the biggest farm-equipment dealership in South Texas . AGCO , John Deere , New Holland , Cat . Impressive . - l 'm sorry , I don 't speak Spanish . - She says I sell drugs . Please don 't speak Spanish anymore . You know Hollis Rice , don 't you ? Vice President of Pan-American Mercantile . Sure. I do business with his bank . I know he 's missing . My partner , John Doggett , was investigating his disappearance . I 'm betting he came to you with questions . - When would this have happened ? - Two weeks ago . No . Sorry. I don 't remember any person named Doggett . Agent , what are you implying ? Mr Molina 's a businessman and a pillar of the c ... Pillar of the community ? Does anyone actually say that except mob lawyers ? I 'll tell you what 's clear to me . You 're some kind of middleman in a smuggling operation . Hollis Rice laundered money for your cartel until he got greedy or talked too much . Your cartel made him disappear . My partner 's disappeared too . He 's in Mexico , and I will find him , whatever it takes . Your only personal hope for the future is that I find him alive . Now , where is he ? Unless my client is under arrest , this meeting is over . No ? Come on , Mariano . Daddy ? Daddy ? Get up. I wanna show you something . Come on . Let 's go . Daddy , come on . Please . - Can 't it wait another hour ? - No . - Why ? What is it ? - lt 's a surprise . Don 't wake your mom . Se침or ? Se침or ? Se침or ? Marine Corps Public Affairs Office . Staff Sergeant McCormick . This is Detective ... Ladatel , calling from Mexico . I 'm hoping you can give me some help . Yes , sir , if I can . We 've got a marine down here who 's been hit by a taxi . He 's been messed up pretty good . He doesn 't remember his own name . He doesn 't have any id . We need to contact his family. I assume somebody somewhere is worrying about him . Can you give me a social security number or date of birth ? No . The only thing I have to go by is there 's a tattoo on his left shoulder that says : " 24th MAU . We shall not forget . " You have any idea what that means ? Yes , I do . The 24th Marine Amphibious Unit . It refers to the Lebanon barracks bombing in 1983 . That narrows things down . Yeah . Good . This guy 's six feet , 190lbs , brown hair , blue eyes , about 40 years old . If you could just put a name to him . If you could just tell me anything at all about him . Anything . We 'll definitely look into it . Detective , do you have a number where l can reach you ? Detective ? Sounding good . It 's sounding better than it was . It won 't sound good until it gets new seals . Thank God I got somebody worth a damn . Now if you 'd only drive for me ... lf you got a few odd jobs , fine . I 'm not breaking the law for you . Man of principle - as far as you know . Found something out about you today . You 're not gonna like it . Says your name is Henry Bruck . Federales are looking for you in connection with a double murder . Doesn 't give details , but that description 's you , as far as I can see . Don 't take it so hard . A man does what he does . I 'm notjudging you . Just keep away from the federales . We 'll keep you safe . Monica . - Dana . - Surprise , surprise . How did you escape Kersh 's cost-cutting regimen ? Did you see ? He shut us down . Actually , he doesn 't know that I 'm here . Or that Skinner is headed to Mexico to consult with the federal police . Perfect timing , I hope . Look whatjust got handed to me . It says someone in Mexico is trying to find an ex-marine matching Doggett 's description . It says that he was in an accident and possibly suffering from amnesia . - Wait . Detective Ladatel ? - That 's who placed the call . Sound familiar ? Ladatel is a Mexican telephone calling card . We 'll trace the call . Domingo , is that you ? I speak English , by the way . Yeah ? Yeah . See you in hell , fbi . Nestor ? Nestor . - You ? - Did you send him after me ? What ? What 's that mean ? Did you send him to kill me ? - Tell me who I am . - l don 't know who you are . Tell me who I am . I don 't know , you son of a bitch . But you killed my friend . You 're a killer , that 's who you are . You 're one of the disappeared ones . What 's that mean , disappeared ? Disappeared by who ? The cartel . They own the town , everything and everybody . People who make trouble for them wind up dead . Other people , who make more trouble dead than alive , get this . They took away my memory ? How ? How do I get it back ? You don 't . That 's the point . Daddy ? Daddy ? Get up. I wanna show you something . It 's a surprise . John . I 've been looking for you everywhere . - Who are you ? - l 'm your partner , Monica . Your name is John Doggett . You 're an fbi agent . Do you remember ? John , trust me . We gotta leave . I 'll explain it in the car , but we 're not safe here . - They 're telling us to come out . - They want us to make it easy for ' em . The cartel owns the cops . They 're gonna kill us . They 're gonna try . Take cover . Won 't be long before they get tired of waiting . So we 're partners ? How long have we been working together ? Not long . But we 've known each other for years . They 're giving us one minute . What 's the name of my son ? It 's weird. lt 's the only thing I can remember , is I have a son . I can see his face , but I can 't remember his name . Luke . How old is Luke ? I can 't even remember that . Oh , God . He 's dead . He was murdered . is that right ? is that right ? He was kidnapped . He was just a little boy ... The fbi got involved . I was assigned to the case . That 's when you and I met . God , John , they 're smoking us out . John , I need you here . I need you to focus here . If we 're gonna die here , you 're gonna die on your feet . You hear me ? Do you hear me ? Get in the bus . Hang on . You work for the cartel . You make their enemies disappear . You understand me ? I speak English , but I don 't understand you . Like hell you don 't . You gave me these ... when you took my memory . I have no idea how you do it , but everything I am , everything I have , my identity , you robbed that from me . I don 't know who has been saying those things to you . How can you prove them ? I was searching for a man . A banker from Texas . Hollis Rice was the banker . He was out of his mind . He didn 't even know his name . You robbed him of that . Then you tried to do the same thing to me . You failed , you son of a bitch . I remember everything . Agent Doggett , leave him to us . Why would you want to remember ? You can 't tell me you 're happier now because you recall your life . I saw it all . So much pain . Why would you want to struggle so long and hard ... to get that pain back ? Because it 's mine . Daddy ? Daddy ? Look , Daddy . I can do it . I 'm so sorry . About Luke . About you having to relive that . I 'll take the bad as long as I can remember the good .

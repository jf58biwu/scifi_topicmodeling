 Jurassic Bark For my next trick , notice I have nothing up my sleeves ... ... and nothing in my head . So if my lovely assistant will kindly supply me ... ... with an ordinary , non-fake pitcher of milk . behold ! The milk has vanished ! exiled , perhaps , to another dimension ! Amazing ! That 's why they call you Bender the Magnificent . No , it isn 't . They discovered an intact 20th-century pizzeria , Iike the one I used to work at ! Interesting . No , wait , the other thing . Tedious . Let 's check it out . You can see how I lived before I met you . - You lived before you met me ? - Sure . Lots of people did . really . truly , they were as gods who built this place . next , we come to the splendidly preserved wooden pizza paddle . Scientists theorize it was used to gently discipline the delivery boy . FRY : Wait a second . This is Panucci 's ! I used to work in this exact pizzeria . And for your information , lady , this was not just used to paddle my butt . It was also used to move pizzas and crush rats . I don 't know where you get your facts , sir ... ... but I am a volunteer housewife with 45 minutes of orientation ... ... and a harlequin romance about archeoIogists . Don 't wave your fancy degrees at me . I recognize all this stuff . Petrified sausages , old Mr. ViteIIi , and that 's- - [ SCREAMS ] MAN : Yes ? - Pizza delivery for Mr. Seymour Asses ? MAN : There 's no one by that name here or anywhere . I hope that in time you 'll realize what an idiot you 've been . I wouldn 't count on that . [ WHIMPERING ] Poor little guy . You look like you haven 't eaten in a month . Here . But if Mr. Panucci asks , your name is Seymour Asses . I Iike you , Seymour . You 're not constantly judging me , Iike all the other dogs . Are you ? We understand each other . people think you 're just a mutt who smells bad ... ... can 't find a girlfriend and has a crummy job . But you 're keeping it real and you call no man " Mister . " well , goodbye . Live long and prosper . [ WHIMPERS ] [ BARKING ] That 's the least appetizing caIzone I 've ever seen . No ! That 's my dog in there ! It 's an outrage , I say . BENDER : Ow ! Ow ! I 'm taking him home and I 'd Iike to see anyone try and stop me . Ow ! Oh ! Ow ! Oh ! Ah ! And then he was ejected by the guards . needless to say , I was mortified . well , it 's not right to make my dead pet an exhibit . That 's like digging up Lassie and putting her in the Louvre . Lassie is on display in the Louvre . I know . I was deliberately describing a similar situation . Why don 't you try protesting , Iike those native Martians . always whining that people don 't treat their ancestors ' bones with respect . [ SLURPING ] Protesting never works . You 're right . I 'II give it a shot ! ALL : What do you want ? - Fry 's dog ! - When do you want it ? - Fry 's dog ! Yeah ! I will now perform my people 's native dance . [ " THE HUSTLE " PLAYS ] It says here that this part of The hustle ... ... impIores the gods to grant a favor , usually a Trans Am . [ SINGS " WALKING ON SUNSHINE " ] [ BARKING " WALKING ON SUNSHINE " ] [ SINGING ] Thattaboy , Seymour . Right here waiting for me as always . Just like that huge mushroom in my shower . Hey , there 's our little mascot . You been swimming in the sewer again ? You rascal . - Fry , cleanup ! - Seymour , cleanup ! - Good dog . - That 's a good Seymour . There 's dog fur on my slice ! No , that 's vermiceIIi . No fur in here . [ BARKING ] FRY : He 's so cute . He can do two things at one time : eat and swim . Three things ! [ MUSIC FADES ] Fry , it 's been three days . You can 't keep boogying like this . You 'II come down with a fever of some sort . I 'm Dr. Ben BeeIer , the paleontologist who discovered your dog . Or as some call it , the BeeIersaurus . So do I get Seymour back ? Are you caving to political pressure ? No . We 're sorry , but there 's just too much ... ... that fossil can teach us about dogs from your time . His name was Seymour . He was once intimate with the leg of a wandering saxophonist . He had wet dog smell , even when dry . And he was not above chasing the number 29 bus . The 29 ? Interesting . - That 's all I needed , right ? - I 'm good . Okay , then . Here 's your dog back . Seymour ! Lady and gentleman ... ... how about a hand for my temporary replacement assistant ? I was all in this part ! It 's magic ! You 're not fit to wear Fry 's Ieotard ! ZOIDBERG : Stop ! - Good news , everyone ! - Hurray , he 's back ! And he 's looking for a garbage can to put the rock in . Here you go , buddy . No . actually , we 've discovered that Fry 's dog was fast-fossiIized ... ... preserving its cellular structure . Which means we can clone it ! Seymour will live again ! A little land mammal . Can you believe it , Bender ? I 'm gonna have my best friend back ! [ SOBBING ] Why the idiot convention ? Cubert , my precious babe . I 'm going to attempt to clone Fry 's dog ... ... using the very same apparatus I used to clone you . Look ! There 's a smidge of toe still in here . You see , beneath the fossil 's crunchy mineral shell ... ... there 's still a creamy core of dog nougat . So will Seymour remember how to sing " walking on Sunshine " ? amazingly , yes . In cases of rapid fossilization , I can press this brain scan button ... ... retrieving Seymour 's memories at the precise instant of doggy death . I 'm gonna get my puppy back ! In your face , Grim Reaper ! Crappy , ineffective reaper . I just need to reset the CIone-O-Mat from human mode to dog mode . COMPUTER : The dog says : [ MOOING ] Oh-oh . This may take a while . [ VIDEO GAME PLAYING ] You stink , loser ! Hey , Fry , pizza going out . Come on ! But I 'm celebrating New Year 's Eve . Like you got squat to celebrate . You 're a delivery boy this millennium ... ... and you 'II be a delivery boy next millennium . [ GROWLS AND WHIMPERS ] What 's with Seymour ? It 's like he don 't want you to go . Or he thinks your pants is too short . Which is crazy , because frankly , you look fabulous . Now get going ! [ WHIMPERING ] I won 't be gone long , Seymour . Just wait here till I come back . [ WHIMPERING ] hello ? Pizza delivery for ... ... " I.C. Wiener " ? Oh , crud . Here 's to another lousy millennium . ALL : Five , four , three , two ... . [ SCREAMS ] What the- - ? A dog collar , for me ? You shouldn 't have . - That 's for Seymour . - Oh . [ SQUEAKING ] A subscription to the Daily Growl ? That 's not a reputable journal of opinion . That 's for Seymour . I 'm getting everything ready for when he 's cloned . Are you on the junk , Fry ? Why waste time on a creature of inferior intelligence ? - Hey , he was smart . He could fetch . - I can fetch ! - He could dig up bones . - hello ? CharIemagne ? plus , I bet he couldn 't create a laser show with his head . [ MUSIC PLAYS ] Look , Bender , this has nothing to do with you . That 's impossible ! Now if you 'II excuse me , I 'm working on Seymour 's doghouse . No one ever asked if Bender would Iike to live in a tiny little house . Not that I would . A tiny little house that says " Bender " on it . BENDER : Ow ! FRY : This is Fry . If you 're calling about the used towels for sale they 're still available for $ 45 each . phil , it 's your father . Where are you ? You 're holding up New Year 's brunch . Your brother can 't wait any longer . hello , first bologna of the new millennium . [ BARKING ] Here he comes . That 's him and Seymour . [ BARKING ] well , that 's weird . Seymour 's here , but- - Go ! Go ! Touchdown ! But where 's philip ? I 'm telling you , the Y2K computers got him . We 'II face burning roads , rivers exploding ... ... calculators transformed into Scud missiles . There 's nothing we can do . [ BARKS " WALKING ON SUNSHINE " ] What 's that , Seymour ? You walking on sunshine ? [ WHIMPERING ] He 's trying to tell us something . Maybe he can lead us to philip ! - should we follow him ? - To our deaths ? Negatory . It 's the Y2K trying to lure us into an ambush . And I ain 't buying it . Pass the bologna . Are you gonna be done soon ? Sorry , but we need to practice hand-to-hand combat ... ... in case an enemy knocks the laser guns out of our hands ... ... and they slide way across the room . could you do it someplace else ? I 'm setting up Seymour 's dog bed . - Okay . - Ow ! [ BENDER WHISTLING ] heel , boy ! heel ! Oh , hello , Fry . I guess I didn 't notice you there . I 'm having such fun with my new best friend , Robo-Puppy . That 's nice . I was just out walking him . Yes , you can walk him . Of course , after he goes , you have to refill the canisters . Come here , boy ! Pet , pet , pet . ROBO-PUPPY : Robo-Puppy receiving petting . Bender , are you jealous of Fry 's puppy ? That 's so adorable ! jealous ? Not when I have the love of Robo-Puppy here . Robo-Puppy , lick my cheek . Robo-Puppy preparing to lick cheek . Robo-Puppy commencing cheek licking . Licking in progress . Licking complete . Robo-Puppy truly is robot 's best friend . There . Perfect . [ MUSIC PLAYS ] Good news , everyone ! The Clone-o-Mat is ready ! [ CHEERING ] finally ! Robo-Puppy commencing two-hour yipping session . [ YIPPING ] Robo-Puppy mistreatment alert ! Robo-Puppy mistreatment alert ! behold once more , the mighty CIone-O-Mat ! Requiring such vast amounts of electricity ... ... that we must harness the elemental power of nature itself ! ALL : Wow . I speak , of course , of molten lava deep within the Earth 's core . To the subbasement ! [ GRUNTING ] [ SCREAMING ] Powering up CIone-O-Mat ! placing fossil on the PIat-CIone-O-Form . Initiating dog brain CAT scan ! Come on , boy . Come back to life . Know ye now what feels like to be dog god ! Commencing DNA extraction . Fry , come on ! The talent show . What ? I 'm in the middle of something . But if we don 't perform , in what sense do we have an act ? Bender , enough . Leave me alone ! So that 's how it is ? I thought you were my friend . But if you love your dog so much , maybe you 'd rather play fetch ! No ! [ SCREAMS ] [ LAUGHING ] Now I 'm all you got ! I hate you ! I hate you ! You evil , metal man ! Ow ! So anyway , your dog is melted . Now we 're friends again . Not necessarily . For the dog may yet survive . May yet ? really ? Indeed . You see , that fossil was made of dolomite ... ... the tough , black mineral that won 't cop out when there 's heat all about . By contrast , observe the lava 's affect on this ice swan . Of course , that would 've melted even at room temperature . I just wanted to get rid of it . But had it been made of that righteous mineral dolomite ... ... there 's a slim chance it might have survived . So Seymour might still exist ? Perhaps , for a few minutes . It 's dolomite , baby ! Then I 'm going in after him ! ALL : No ! - He 'd come after me ! [ DOOR SQUEAKS ] Acting like a moron won 't bring your dog back . Then all hope is lost ! Goodbye , Seymour . [ SOBBING ] please stop crying , Fry . Here . I assumed you were just pretending to love the dog ... ... to toy with my emotions . - What have I done ? - You didn 't do anything . Don 't beat yourself up . Fry , I 'm sorry . I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature ... ... because I Iove you . Not in the way of the ancient Greeks , but the way a robot loves a human ... ... a human loves a dog , and occasionally , a gorilla loves a kitty . I 'm going in ! I 'm a professor ! Why isn 't anyone listening to me ? You can 't go in because you 'II melt ! The fossil only has a chance because it 's made of dolomite . I 'm 40 percent dolomite ! BENDER : Oh , it 's hot . Oh , it 's very hot ! [ BARKING ] I am one hung-over cryogenicist . Throw that mutt in the freezer till his owners come . You can 't solve all your problems by freezing them . I think you 're forgetting our motto . Are you the cryogenicist who called about our son 's dog ? You must be the Frys . Yeah , he 's right over there . Sorry we 're late . We all got sick from eating bad bologna . Y2K . What 's he so worked up about ? He 's just upset because our boy 's missing . Come on , you overgrown rat ! Lead us to philip . [ WHIMPERING ] Bender 's been down there too long ! - I 'm going in after him ! - Professor ! Lava ! Hot ! This is all my fault . I let my best friend risk his life just to get my dead dog back . - Bender ! - And that is why they call me ... ... Bender the Magnificent ! Hey , where 'd everybody go ? Okay , Iet 's clone us some dog . - Yeah ! - Very well . Let this abomination unto the Lord begin ! Interesting . It seems Seymour died at the ripe old age of 1 5 . Fifteen ? You mean he lived for 1 2 more years after I got frozen ? Indeed . Stop the cloning . Oh , sure . Smash the smart guy 's machine . - Fry , what 's wrong ? - Think about it . Seymour lived a full life after I was gone . He probably even added new songs to his repertoire . But that 's a good thing . " walking on Sunshine " sucks noodles . I had Seymour till he was 3 . That 's when I knew him and that 's when I Ioved him . I 'II never forget him . But he forgot me a Iong , long time ago .

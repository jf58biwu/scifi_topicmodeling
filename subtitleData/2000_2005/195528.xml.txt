 * * [ Rap ] - [ Yawns ] - You getting tired , Dad ? Yeah , a little . - Sure is a lonely road . - Nice try , but no . Aw , come on , Dad . Let me drive . I know how . You can navigate . You 're a great navigator . When I was your age , I was a terrific navigator . - Dad , look out ! - Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! You stay here . What happened ? I just about hit you . You 're lucky to be alive . You 're right . It 's totally my fault . I heard you coming , and I just didn 't want you to miss me . Yeah , well , is everything okay ? Yeah , you ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . I 'm fine . - Hey , look , I 'm real sorry . A deer ran out in front of us , and I swerved to miss it ... - and , well , you can see for yourself . - [ Thunder Rumbling ] At least Molly and I are okay . I tried to back out ... but it looks like I dug ourselves in deeper . - This is my wife Molly . - Hi . - And I 'm Woodrow Lovell . - Dennis Conway . - Nice to meet you . - Cool car . This is my son Nick . I told you to stay in the van . - Maybe the four of us could push it back on the road . - I think it 's in deeper than that . I have some chains in the trunk , if you wouldn 't mind hitching us to the back of your van . I 'll take a look . [ Woodrow ] Why is what you 're looking for always on the bottom ? Take that , Molly . Careful . Careful . You know what ? We can do this , okay ? [ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Dennis ] Better hurry . It 's going to rain . Just relax . We 'll be out of here in a minute , okay ? [ Dennis ] Okay , Woodrow ! Don 't worry , it 'll be okay . I 'm not a very good traveler . Well , my dad and my grandma started me young . Every summer , we would take a trip out west . Lucky boy . I wish I 'd seen more of the world . - Aha ! Okay ! - All right . That 's it ! Thank heavens you were kind enough to help . - I don 't know what we would 've done without you . - No trouble at all . - Not bad , Dad . - It 's a Chevy . You got the chain ? - It worked ! - Thank you so much . This Impala 's in great shape . What is it , ' 60 , ' 61 ? Yeah , it 's a ' 61 . That 's right . - You into vintage cars ? - Yeah , a little bit . Forgive me for being so rude , but we 're behind schedule already . No trouble . We 've got to find a place to stay tonight too . [ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Molly ] It 's not the time to make friends . Nothin ' we can do ? - Uh , no . - Okay . Well , I hope your journey 's a good one . - Thanks again . - Yeah . You too . Take care now . [ Molly ] Let 's just go . That 's it . Hey , Dad , look . Do you think we could catch ' em ? I doubt it . They 're from Springville . Hey , that 's on the way . I saw it on the map . - Let 's drop it off for ' em . - All right . Come on . Uh-uh-uh . That 's not ours . Maybe there 's something gruesome in it , and they wanted us to find it ... so we 'd get blamed for the murder . Come on , Dad . Admit it . Weren 't they a little weird ? What do you mean ? They were , though . [ Chuckling ] [ Sighs ] I can 't drive anymore . What do we do now , Woodrow ? We don 't have a contingency plan . I don 't know , but I 'll think of something . I just can 't go any further . Don 't . We have to keep going . Otherwise , they 'll find us . [ Engine Starts ] Where is this place ? - Fifty-four . There it is . - Hey , good eyes . Hmm . [ Vehicle Approaching ] Hello ? - Hey . - Evening . Could I see some identification , please ? Yeah , sure . Just gonna drop off the duf ... Here you go . - Evenin ' . - Hi . - White Plains , New York . - Yeah . You 're a long way from home , Mr. Conway . Yeah . I 'm on vacation with my son . I didn 't know I needed a permit for that . - Is there a problem or something ? - Nope . Look . I just found this duffel , and the tag on it said 54 Glover Road ... so I was just trying to do a favor and drop it off . - You found that bag where ? - Well , the couple ... Molly and Woodrow ... they had some car trouble up in the mountains . - What kind of trouble ? - Well , they got stuck . It wasn 't an accident . Nobody got hurt . But when they drove off , they left the duffel , so ... Well , I 'll make sure they get it . Yeah . Okay . I mean , this is their house , right ? Yes , it is , but no one 's home . When we drove up , the lights were on . Well , that 's probably just an automatic timer . Thank you for your help , Mr. Conway . You and your son have a safe trip . Yeah . Okay . Oh , hey . Could you point me in the direction of the closest motel ? Yeah . There 's one about 50 miles south in Lexington . Good night . Okay . - What was that about ? - Small town cops ... too much time . [ Engine Starts ] We 're runnin ' on fumes . Wonderful . So how long are we gonna stay here ? Well , I 'll tell you what . As soon as that gas station opens down there ... we 'll get gas , grub , and we 'll hit the dusty trail . Sounds good . There 's no camping here , Mr. Conway . We got no choice , unless there 's another gas station open in town . I didn 't think so . Josh , the man 's in a bind . Show him some hospitality . Mr. Conway , where did you say you found the duffel bag ? I didn 't . Down Highway 281 , about 100 miles from here . Gas station opens 8 : 00 a.m. - Good night . - Enjoy your evening . They sure seemed obsessed about that duffel bag . [ Door Opens ] [ Door Closes ] Molly ... are you all right ? Look at me . Look at you . I don 't want to be like this . Do you want to go back ? No . I want it to be yesterday . [ Dennis ] Good mornin ' , Springville , USA . - It 's a nice little town , isn 't it ? - Yeah . We should sleep in the camper every night . - I feel great . - Me too . Yeah . We 're just gonna make it . [ Bell Dings ] Will you take over that carburetor for me ? Get some of that gear , would you ? Get the show on the road . - I got it . - Thanks . - Hey . - Hey . - That Vette could use some attention . - Yeah . Yeah . It 's been hanging over my head for years . One of those projects I 'm gonna get to someday . Oh , yeah . I got a few of those myself . - Fill ' er up ? - Yeah , thanks . Hey , can you recommend a good place where we can grab some breakfast ? Breakfast ? Yeah . Emma 's diner . - There 's no competition . - Yeah ? - Probably no other diner either , huh ? - Yeah . You got it . [ Bell Rings ] Oh , my , my . Look at him . We don 't get out much . He 's got a teenager ... obviously married . You hungry ? - Yeah . - Yeah , me too . [ Woman ] Morning . - Hey . - Hello . - Coffee ? - Please . Haven 't seen you in here before . You get lost or are you just passing through ? We 're just passing through , thanks . Do you make your pancakes from scratch ? Is there another way ? My grandma used to make ' em from scratch . She would use chocolate chips and bananas too . That sounds good . - I 'll ask Wilma to do exactly that . - All right . - Thanks . - You 're welcome . Will your wife be joining us ? Uh , no . I 'd like the toast and the fresh fruit , please . Sure . Be up in a flash . Thanks . Hey , Dad , how come everyone 's checking us out ? 'Cause we 're the two new guys in town . I don 't know . They probably don 't get that many people passing through . - We 're pretty far off the beaten track . - Hmm . No wedding band and no wife in the parking lot . Well , Emma , I hate to burst your bubble , but he 'll be gone by noon . - That kid 's pretty good . - I can do better than that . Go ahead . - All right . Thanks . - I 'll call you when the food 's ready . [ Bell Rings ] Hey , man . Can I show you a trick on your board ? And why would I let you use my board ? And you 're giving me advice about staying realistic ? I 'll see ya . - Can you ollie ? - Yeah , I can ollie . - [ Engine Revs ] - [ Beeping ] Come on , man . I 'm trying to practice . Look out ! Nick . Stay down . - [ Screams ] - Are you all right ? Oh , man ! [ People Shouting ] - My leg ! - It 's all right . Stay calm . [ Man ] Somebody call an ambulance ! Nick ? He 's my son . He 's my son ! - Dad , my leg ! - I 'm a doctor . Let me look at him . - Hold still . - Just breathe . - The cable broke . - It hurts so much , Dad ! Okay . Just relax . - Well , it could have been worse . - Hi . Mr. Conway ? So Nick 's gonna be fine , but his left tibia and his fibula are broken . - Tibula ? - The bones in your lower leg . - Otherwise , he 's okay . - Yes . But there 's a lot of swelling , so we 'll have to wait till it goes down before we can cast . - How long ? - Hopefully tomorrow , maybe the day after . You 'll have to stay put until then . - I guess river rafting 's out . - I guess so . If you get your cast wet , a very itchy , stinky , gross mold ... will eat away all of your skin . [ Woman ] Dr. Weston 's a fine doctor . She 'll have him fixed up as good as new , right , Sophie ? I 'll try . If you have a moment , Mr. Conway , we 'll need a statement . - Insurance , you know . - What do you need ? I have all the paperwork down at the station . All right . I 'll stop by later . So , this doesn 't hurt , does it ? - Not that much . - Okay . What 's that ? It 's them , all right . [ Man On TV ] Susan Alexander , I dare you . - [ Buzzer ] - [ Audience Laughter ] Susan , you 've got to hit the board . Okay , and one more time . It 's a microwave oven , Susan . [ Woman ] Oh , wonderful . ! No . Happy birthday , Molly . [ Molly Whimpering ] Molly . - Oh , God . - No . - Oh , God . - Josh , no . No . - Oh , hey ! - Hey . Check what I got . - Ow ! - Ooh , sorry , sorry . It 's all right . No way . Issue two ? Yeah , original . Not a reprint . The Violator 's a great bad guy . - So no motel in town , I was told . - No , not for years . Well , it 's all right . I slept fine in the camper last night . You 're welcome to sleep in the bed across from Nick . Yeah ? Thank you . - It 's , uh ... - It 's Dylan . Dennis . I 'll check on him throughout the day , but he 'll be fine . The Conways are allergic to hospitals . You look like you could use some air . Take a walk , clear your head . No . I 'm okay . There 's no need to feel guilty . We 've got him covered . - I could use a run . - There you go . Try the woods north of town . Watch out for bears . He 's a freelance writer . He 's been a single father since his son Nick was three . That 's what it 's like out there . Sometimes I forget how lucky we are . His mother died last year after a long bout of ... Alzheimer 's . Where are you gettin ' that ? - Mr. Conway ... - Call me Dennis . You probably know everything about me already anyway . Where do you get the information ? It 's available to law enforcement through the NCIC ... the FBI database . Well , may I ask why ? We like to know who 's visiting . You don 't miss a trick , do you ? Thank you , Mr. Conway . We do our best . Now let 's get down to business , shall we ? According to the truck driver , the accident was just a combination of unfortunate circumstances . Yes . Listen , I 'm not gonna sue anybody , if that 's what you 're worried about . Do you want me to sign a release ? - No problem . - Great . I 'm sorry things worked out this way , Robert . Mom and Dad made their own choices . - Some of them weren 't the best . - This belonged to them too . They wouldn 't want anything fancy . Plain pine will do . Of course . I hate signing death certificates . Everything by the book , Sophie , including socializing with tourists . I 'm just doing my job , Josh . Robert . Can I help you ? - Woodrow ? - No . Robert . And you are ? Uh , Dennis Conway . I 'm sorry . I thought you were Woodrow . This is his car . No , it 's mine . Woodrow was my brother . He had one exactly like it . So he 's back in town then ? Did he get the duffel bag that I found ? Unfortunately , he won 't be needing that now . - [ Bells Ringing ] - Oh ? There was a terrible accident ... head-on collision . But there 's not a scratch on it . And I told you this is my car . Theirs was totaled . I 'm very sorry . It 's terrible to lose family . Yeah . Yeah , that 's the truth . And if you don 't mind , I could use some privacy . I 'm still in a bit of shock . - Of course . I 'm terribly sorry . - It 's okay . Told him dad was my brother and the car belonged to me . I think he bought it . He 's harmless , Josh . He 'll be gone soon . I 'm just saying that if he isn 't , we 're gonna have a problem . Excuse me . Gus , this car has been hanging around for 40 years collecting ' dust . - What 's the urgency now ? - Conway . You know , the guy whose kid saved Dylan . He came by , got me thinking about things I keep postponing . Uh-huh . What the heck . It can 't hurt to look her over ... see what needs to be done in case I get motivated to do it . You all right about tomorrow night , Gus ? Are you sure you can do it ? I said yes , didn 't I ? I don 't understand how you two can act like it 's just any other night , that it doesn 't bother you . - Carol . - We all know the truth . Why can 't we talk about it ? All right , Jack . Truth . No regrets , no second thoughts ? Not a one . How about you ? Nope . [ Motor Whirring ] That 's not allowed , Mr. Conway . What 's the problem now ? - This is private property . - But I didn 't see any signs . The people that live here don 't need signs to know where the boundaries are . You keep a lot in your head , don 't you ? The big stuff . Yeah . I 'll drive you to town . [ Dennis ] You a Mariners fan ? McGwire 's chasing the record again . You ever see him hit ? Powerful . Yankee fan , myself . Yeah , Yankee Stadium , house that Ruth built . Well , before Steinbrenner . It 's pretty exciting to watch those guys knock ' em out . That Griffey , he does it almost every game . I always watch , hoping he 's gonna wall another one out , you know . A little bit of history . You watch baseball ? Okay . Can you drop me off over there ? You know , you really ought to catch a game . I saw the Babe hit number 60 , you jerk . Hi . You guys don 't waste any time . Woodrow and Molly . Yes . Say , how come there are no dates on any of the headstones ? We know when they died . Ah . Doc . Official business ? Woodrow and Molly 's paperwork . I just faxed it to the state recorder . Sophie , it wouldn 't have mattered ... the Lovells staying or leaving . Yeah . That 's what I 've been trying to tell myself ... but I saw their bodies . And ? And they weren 't the way we knew them . They were so old . Isn 't it better what happens here ... instead of just leaving it to chance ? I don 't know . It seems our tradition isn 't exactly very humane either . Easy , easy . Yeah . Yeah , I know . I know . Conway . Do you talk to him much ? A bit . Oh . I know that look . - No , it 's nothing . - Uh-huh , uh-huh . He seems like a nice guy . I hope for his sake he puts Springville behind him . Yeah , for his sake . Hi . So , did you see what there is to see of Springville ? Yeah . It seems like a decent place to live . I 'm starving . Have you had dinner ? Uh , no , but , uh ... Don 't worry . The night shift 's on duty , and we 'll just be out front . - Yeah ? - Yeah . And so Gus runs out of the hospital , still in his hospital gown ... running out into the woods . Hmm . Do you mind if I ask you a personal question that is absolutely none of my business ? Fire away . Where 's Nick 's mom ? Hmm . You didn 't see the police report ? Uh-oh . I thought they made copies for everyone . In their minds , they 're just protecting the town . They mean well . My wife died of cancer when Nick was three . - My mom was helping me raise him . - Was ? Yeah . She passed away a few months ago . She 'd been suffering from Alzheimer 's for the past few years , so ... - I 'm so sorry . - Yeah . Before the disease , she was smart , she was adventurous ... great sense of humor . Then she slowly turned into somebody I didn 't know . How 's Nick coping ? We pray about it sometimes . That gets him talking . I think he 's gonna be okay . I lost my son . I can 't imagine that . That must be unbearable . Never stops hurting . But life goes on and things change . Mind if I ask you a personal question , which is absolutely none of my business ? - Fire away . - [ Dennis Chuckles ] Are you married ? Not anymore . [ Sophie ] You 're doing great , Nick . I 'm almost done . Okay . You 'll feel better soon . Caleb Dunn , clinic administrator . - I 'm sorry about your son 's accident . - Oh , thank you . So , how 's our young patient this morning ? Are we ready to give him his walking papers ? I can 't cast him till tomorrow at least . There must be something you could do . Mr. Conway 's been more than patient . - No , not without jeopardizing Nick . - Right . We wouldn 't want that . I have an idea . Since the accident occurred in Springville ... the city could pay to have Nick transported to the hospital in Lexington . They have much more sophisticated equipment there . Well , I think we 'd rather stay here . Thanks . Right , Nick ? It 's your decision , Mr. Conway . Sophie , can we speak privately ? Excuse me . Dad , I think she 's got a crush on you . Yeah ? What makes you say that ? 'Cause she 's always coming to check up on me . - Well , maybe she 's got a crush on you . - No . It 's the way she looks at you . - How does she look at me ? - Like you 're the only one in the room . That 's good . Sophie , this is completely unacceptable . We have to cast that kid today . I can 't . I 'll have to go through the whole thing again . - He may never even heal properly . - What about tonight ? Don 't worry . I 'll take care of him . Come on , Carol . We 've been through this before . You always said you were gonna be there for me . I know , Jack , but I can 't . I don 't want to let you down , but I just can 't . I understand . I understand . Shh . Yeah , right there . Yeah . Maybe one of those logs bounced off your head , hmm ? It sure feels like it . I 'm proud of you . You risked your life to save that kid . I didn 't even think . There wasn 't time . You 've got good instincts , thank God . Ahem . - Wow . You look great . - Thank you . Do you got a hot date ? No , just a business thing ... a fund-raiser for the clinic . To tell you the truth , I wish I didn 't have to go . - Ditch it then . - I can 't . Can I interest either of you in dessert ? Ah , that depends . Is it from the diner ? Even better . Made it myself . - You made this ? - Mm-hmm . Boiled the water and opened the box . Chocolate 's my favorite . Well , enjoy . I 've gotta run . Um , hey , am I gonna , uh , see you later ? Probably not . These political things tend to last forever . - Good-bye . - Bye . There 's no way she 's got a crush on me . You are so wrong . - Grandma taught me how women work . - Did she ? She said that she tried to tell you , but you couldn 't catch a clue . [ Chuckles ] * * [ Jazz ] Are we okay to go ? [ Sophie ] The sleeping pills worked . Are you sure ? Yes , Tim . They 'll be sleeping till morning . Get over here as soon as you can . I was thinking , just to be totally safe , maybe I should stay here . You can 't . We need you here . I 've got a feeling Jack might need help . All right . - Happy birthday , Jack . - Thanks . Where 's Carol ? She changed her mind . I 'll be there for you . There he is . Happy birthday , Jack . - Let 's get you a drink . - Ooh . I second that . - Hey . - There 's the man . Happy birthday , Jack . Where 's Carol ? - I loved that . - You are so cute , Jack . Jack , it 's almost dawn . [ Tim ] Everyone , it 's time . Who will help our friend to cross the spring ? I will . I 'll be his guide . Jack Pendergast , it is first light ... on the day commemorating your birth in Springville in the year 1900 . - Happy birthday , old friend . - Happy birthday , Jack . May your journey be a good one . Let 's do it . - This is no problem . Hmm ? - Take care of her , all right ? - Make it quick . - I 'll do my best . May your journey be a good one . Oh , God bless you , Jack . Dr. Weston ? His journey has begun . No . Get away from me . Nick Conway ? Huh ? - You 're his dad ? - Mm-hmm . Joe Tichenor . I was driving the logging truck . Oh . I 'm sorry about your leg , Nick . My insurance company told me not to come by ... but I wanted to see how you were doin ' . It 's okay . - What time is it ? - It 's about 10 : 15 . It 's just every time I make a run to Springville , it gives me the creeps . - Things aren 't the same here . - How 's that ? - Weird . Like for instance ... - May I help you ? Just visiting , ma 'am . I 'd better scoot . You take care , son . What did he want ? He just stopped by to check up on Nick . Was pretty decent of him , I thought . People around here are decent , Dennis . Are you okay ? You don 't seem like your normal , healthy jogger self this morning . - Didn 't you sleep well ? - Yeah . I slept like a rock . Just feel like I got hit in the head by one , but yeah , I slept good . - Dad , I 'm really hungry . - Yeah ? Could you get me some more of those pancakes ? Yeah . That sounds good . I could use a pot of coffee myself . You want somethin ' , Sophie ? - No , but thanks for asking . - Yeah . [ Bell Rings ] - Emma , coffee , please . - Mm-hmm . Gas station , right ? Dennis Conway . - Oh . Gus . - How you doin ' ? Well , my best friend died this morning . Gus , I 'm sorry . Jack and I were best friends ever since he beat me up in kindergarten ... after I 'd coldcocked him . My first wife and I used to double with him and Carol . How did he die ? Uh , natural . Peaceful . - He was your best friend ? - Yeah . Jack was what they call " young at heart . " Here 's Nick 's special pancakes . You tell him Emma sends a big hug . Thanks . If there 's anything I can do . Maybe we can make some progress on that Vette before I go . What do you say ? Why bother ? There 's not enough time to finish it up . All right . Take it easy . What are you doing ? I don 't know . Nick ? Sophie , are you gonna cast ? You didn 't say anything . Oh , I didn 't know myself until I checked him over . Nick wanted it to be a surprise . I 'll be done in 10 minutes . Okay , well , um , I 'll leave your pancakes right here , okay ? - * * [ Rap ] - And , uh ... [ No Audible Dialogue ] You want me to stay , or are you okay ? - Oh , no . I 'm okay . - Okay . I 've got a few calls to make . - Is there a phone I could use ? - Use my office . It 's down the hall . Thanks . [ Line Ringing ] You have six new messages and four saved messages . Main menu . To access your new messages , press one . To hear your saved messages , press two . " Molly . " " Natural . " " Woodrow . " " Age 100 " ? Sophie . My God . It 's Gus . " ' 55 . " [ Door Opening ] " We regret to inform you your ... your son ... " - How 's Nick ? - Great . He 's back in his room , if you want to see him . Yeah , of course I would . But first , I want to know somethin ' . Sophie , what were the Roaring ' 20s like ? And was the Great Depression really that depressing ? And what was worse ? Was it World War I or World War II ? And were the ' 50s just as bland as they say ? Because you look like you 're having fun . You went through my personal things ? What the hell is goin ' on , Sophie ? Who are you ? What are you ? - What am I ? - Yes . What do you think ? Well , you look damn good for a woman of about 80 . Sophie ! I can 't tell you . I swore an oath on my life . Well , that must be one hell of a secret . - It 's a choice . - A choice ? As in do I choose to haul water on a trip like the Lovells did ... or do I choose to keep strangers away from a certain mountain spring ? The closer you get to this , the more danger you and Nick are in . Nick and I can take care of ourselves . We don 't need your protection , okay ? If you really care , Sophie , show me what the water can do . - Dad , catch me if I fall . - Just a few more steps , Nick . All right . Here I go . Why don 't you have a seat right over there ? Right here . - Are you ready , Nick ? - You be careful . Okay . Nick , I need you to be real still . Dennis , we 're gonna help him into the water . Okay , let 's get in the water . You ready ? All right , put your arm around my shoulder . - [ Grunts ] - Easy . You have to be careful . All right . - I feel good . - Yeah ? - Okay , Nick . - Put it in there . Now dive as deep as you can . - Dad ! My leg ! Check it out ! - Oh , my God . The spring , it heals . Whoo ! Sophie , it 's the fountain of youth ! [ Nick Laughs ] - I 'll be damned . - You just may be . As soon as people see Nick , they 'll know we 've been to the spring . It 's amazing you 've kept this quiet as long as you have . Well , we take our oath very seriously . Never thought I 'd be the one to break it . How do you justify keeping the secret ? We all believe that if we shared the spring with the world , wars would be fought over it ... or millions or people would come here hoping , leaving their garbage behind ... and what we have would be destroyed for everyone . Nothing would be gained . So the people of Springville get it all ... because you were lucky enough to be born here , right ? The occasional outsider is invited to stay . I want to stay . You don 't know everything . It doesn 't last forever . Well , how long ? A hundred years . That 's what we decided . How do you decide something like that ? People aren 't meant to live forever , Dennis ... - and the natural cycle of life is ... - So what happens ? At dawn , on the day of your 100th birthday ... you no longer drink the water , and there 's no exceptions . Hell of a way to spend your birthday , don 't ya think ? [ Laughing ] - So how old are you ? - In my heart , I 'm 17 . What do you think about settling down here ? I don 't know . Why ? Are you thinkin ' about it ? Wait , wait , wait . This is all premature . It 's not up to you , Dennis . Maybe we should go inside . - When can I go outside and rollerblade ? - Hold on there , sport . I want you to be a part of this . I 'm sure if I present my case , they 'll invite us to stay . - Dad , I never said I wanted to stay . - Whether they do or not ... comes down to commitment and trust from both of you . You need to think this through very carefully . Yeah , like what about all my friends in New York ? And your job . What about your family , your friends ? Aren 't they gonna wonder ? Well , Nick is my only family . I can write anywhere . There 's no reason for us to go back to New York . There 's nothing holding us there . [ Nick ] Except it was my home . Here he comes . Good afternoon , Josh . I was expecting you . You 're wanted down at town hall , Sophie . You need to stay here , okay ? I 'm comin ' with you . You 're not a citizen . - Best to be assertive ? - Just be honest . You 're gonna have to stay here . I want my chance to speak . I 'm sure you do . Megan , make sure he doesn 't go anywhere . [ Tim ] Admit that you told them about the spring . I didn 't . Dennis ... Mr. Conway had already figured most of it out . - So you filled in the missing pieces ? - I had no choice . [ Emma ] That 's not entirely true , Sophie . You had a little something to do with it . You 've been encouraging him since he showed up . Emma , even if I were lucky enough to fall in love at my age ... I would never risk the lives of my friends . I believe you , Sophie . - Can we trust him , though ? - Yes . For heaven 's sakes , Robert ... he came here to return your parents ' bag . He 's not a man who could hurt someone for profit . I mean , he would never sell out our secret for money . You don 't know for sure . Does he know about Jack 's birthday party ? I wanted to tell him , but Nick was nearby . He won 't be 18 for five years . They all know anyway . - If we vote no , what happens to him ? - You know the covenant . We can 't punish him like someone who purposely broke the covenant . Besides , we have Nick to consider . He hasn 't done anything wrong . No matter how nice they may seem , any unknown element poses a threat . He won 't tell anyone if we let him stay . Josh , what do you think ? They 've agreed to let you speak for yourself . [ Tim ] Why do you want to stay in Springville ? What do you want from us , and what are you prepared to give ? Well , I want a safe world for my son to grow up in . I 'd rather he not experience the kind of pain or disease that my wife and mother had to . I want Nick to reach his potential and then to go beyond that . That 's what you want for your son . What do you want for yourself ? - That 's all I want for myself . - You 're not being honest , Dennis . Everyone wants something . My wife died when she was 24 . There was nothing I could do to stop her pain or her death . After that , the future for me was an illusion . Everything could be just snatched away in a heartbeat . I had two people to love : My son , my mother . I wasn 't about to risk loving anybody else ... until now . [ Tim ] Now ? I don 't think it 's an accident that I 'm here in Springville . Are you prepared to commit yourself and your son to the covenant of this town ? Yes , I am . - What do you think ? - That 's not my job . - Mr. Conway ? - Yeah . Mr. Conway , the council has decided ... although not unanimously ... to grant you and your son conditional residency in Springville . Oh , thank you very much . So conditionally , welcome to Springville . Welcome to Springville . You know , you 've actually got me believing ... we might get my Vette running , after all . You guys make it sound like it 's a disease . I mean , I like old people . - I loved my grandma . - Well , I love mine too . - Oh , nice ! - How old is she ? Uh , I don 't know . See , at least if I didn 't know how old somebody was , I had a general idea , you know ? Yeah , but what 's it really matter , you know ? So you know how to treat ' em ... nicer . - Why ? You treat everybody else lousy ? - No . Just the geeks . No , I mean ... It 's like , where 's the order of things ? Who can you hang out with ? Who 's gonna get your music and not hassle you about your clothes ? Yeah . Well , you know , I get your music . That 's ' cause we 're the same age , right ? - Right ? - Uh , well ... I don 't remember , but they told me I was 13 . Well , I don 't remember being born , so I guess that 's what they tell me too . - Yeah , right . - Hey , Dad . Hey . Help me out with one of these suitcases , huh , prince ? - Hey , Dylan , that 's for you . - Oh , thanks . - Gotta help out the old guy . - Of course . - Hi , Sophie . - Hey , how you guys doin ' ? Hi . - You 're sure this is all right ? - Oh , no , it 's a big house . I got plenty of room . It 'll be nice to share it with somebody . All right . Well , just till something else opens up . In Springville , it could be awhile . You want a little help with that ? - No , I think I can manage . - You sure ? I don 't know about you , but I don 't trust that Conway as far as I can throw him . Not trusting Conway 's a given . What about Sophie ? Can we still trust her ? [ Dennis ] This smells great . Emma 's a wonderful cook . I have to warn you , though . I am terrible . Did you ever leave Springville for any length of time ? Yes . I left when I went to med school , after my son died . It was too painful to stay here . What happened ? Why couldn 't the water keep him safe ? Well , he enlisted during World War II . That was his photograph on your desk . Yeah . Is his father still alive ? His father was Gus . Gus ? - Gus and I were high school sweethearts . - Really ? We got married when we were young . Even if we were perfect soulmates , I don 't think we would have lasted the 82 years . And when a child dies ... Well , for us , it was the end . Yeah . I promised myself after that that I would live in the moment . But I haven 't . Why not ? Right now I can 't imagine . I don 't want to lead you on . You already have . Hey , yo . Lookin ' sharp . So I hear you 're staying at Sophie 's . Word travels fast . I hear you were her husband . That I was . And you never forget your first , Dennis . Sophie was my great love . - She 's a special lady . - That she is . She talks like the very idea is preposterous ... two people being in love for 82 years ... but I could have stayed in love with her ... if she would have let me . This the car you had with her ? No . My , no . This car was Elvis , you know . And Buddy ... the ' 50s . Every decade had its moments . I enjoyed every one of them . So you feel like getting your hands dirty ? - What do you need ? - One of these . Romance of the open road , eh ? [ Siren Wailing ] [ Tires Screeching ] What the heck ? Hey , Josh . What 's up ? Wasn 't speeding ' , was I ? - Where you goin ' ? - Lexington . Gus and I are working on his Vette , and he needs some spare parts , so ... - You can get those on-line . - I wish I could . I 'll have to hit at least a half dozen junkyards just to get what I need . You 're not hearing me . Turn your vehicle around and return to Springville . You 're serious . Mr. Conway , right now you are a provisional citizen . That means you have absolute freedom as long as you abide by our rules . Have a good day . You know ... I 'd never say , " I told you so , " but I think we just moved to hell . * * [ Piano : " For Elise " ] [ Splash ] * * [ Whistling " For Elise " ] [ Sighs ] Now you know something else about the water . I think I 'm gonna be very clean in Springville . [ Chuckling ] [ Groans ] - You all right ? - We 'll never get it done . - Yeah , we will . It just takes time . - I really wanted to see her finished . Dennis , it 's my birthday in two days . My 100th . [ Engine Revs ] So you 're just gonna stop drinking the water then . Just like that , right ? No . No , not exactly . Well , what then ? Gus ? Gus ? Hey , man . - [ Crack ] - Aah ! Oh , man ! What happened ? Lemme see , lemme see . - We gotta get you to the clinic , bud . - [ Groans ] It was a dumb thing to do . We could go to the spring , bathe it in the water . It 's strongest near the source . Gus said he had a birthday coming up . How come you never mentioned that ? Maybe I was trying not to think about it . Yeah , well , it got me thinkin ' . I remembered what you said ... about you and Gus bein' high school sweethearts and how you married young . And then it hit me . You 're probably gonna be 100 too . Am I right ? More or less . You didn 't think this was something that we should maybe talk about ? Nothing we say will make any difference . I told you it wouldn 't last forever . Yeah , well , I just didn 't think it would fall apart so quickly . Oh , there you are . - Hi , Sophie . - Hi . - How 's your hand ? - It 's been better . Would you mind if I talked to Dennis alone ? - No , I 'm done . - Good . - What 's up ? - Can you keep a secret ? This entire town is counting on it . - I quit drinkin ' the water . - How come ? Like I told you , to see what old feels like . You know , before my birthday . I don 't know what 's gonna happen exactly or how long . Gus , why don 't you just leave , you know ? And ruin 100 years of integrity ? - Uh-uh . It 's time to pay the piper . - I 'm sorry . I don 't understand . It 's not like I 've been cheated out of anything . If I hadn 't been born in Springville , I probably would have died years ago . And what 's the downside of doing it like this , knowing my time and place ? Gives you a chance to prepare , get your things in order . Yeah , but they never are , you know ? They never are . It 's like this car . You 're comin ' to my birthday party ? Yeah , I 'll be there . All right , a good thing about Springville is ... if I screw up doing a trick , I could just go and heal myself in the spring . - That 's a good thing , right ? - Right . - All right , what else ? - Dad , that 's it . There 's nothing to do here . What about your friend , Dylan ? You 've got a good buddy there . Yeah , but I lost about 20 back in White Plains . Dad , just ' cause you 're a loner doesn 't mean I have to be . - Hey , hey . - I said " loner , " not " loser . " Look , Nicky . Sometimes life gives you these opportunities , right ? And you 've got to grab ' em or they leave , they 're gone . I know the transition 's gonna be hard ... but I think living here is gonna be better for us . - You know what I wish ? - Yeah ? I wish I had never told you to make friends with Sophie ... because if it wasn 't for her , we wouldn 't be here . You don 't know that . And besides , it 's not you that made it happen . You know , if you did this for me ... I don 't want it , and you know that . So since you did it for you , you 're selfish . How 's Gus 's party comin ' together ? It 's gonna be great . I guarantee it . Anything special ? We do have a suggestion . * * [ Cajun Band ] [ People Laughing , Chattering ] - How many of these have you been to ? - Too many . Look , Dennis , I 'm not sure you really understand what happens here . There 's Gus . Happy birthday , Gus . You look pretty good behind the wheel of that car , old fella . - You made it . - Oh , yeah . - She 's a beauty , isn 't she ? - Yeah . She turned out great . It 's Gus . - Surprise , surprise . - Here 's to ya , buddy . Hey , Gus . What ? What on earth ? - Happy birthday , Gus . - Thank you . I spoke with the council . They agree with your suggestion . * * [ Cajun Waltz ] Hey . You can whet your whistle with that while you 're out here cutting ' a rug . Enough of this stuff , and anyone 's a hero . [ Microphone Feedback ] Everyone , it 's time . - You take care of Sophie , hmm ? - Of course I will . - This is for you too . - Gus ... You think of me from time to time , hmm ... while you 're makin ' new memories . Who will help our friend Gus cross the spring ? What 's he talking about ? I told you they stopped drinking the water , but that 's only part of it . Tell me the rest . Dennis Conway will do it . You asked to stay and we let you . This is what you chose , what we all have to do . Gus , ask them to pick someone else . They 'll listen to you . Please . No . Come on , Dennis . Jack Pendergast has a head start on me . Is this really what you want ? Everybody dies . Nobody wants to . Tell me what to do . Well , when Mayor Watanabe says ... you hold my head under . God bless you , Gus . Stay low . It is first light on the day commemorating your birth ... in Springville in the year 1900 . - Happy birthday , old friend . - Happy birthday , Gus . You may help Gus cross the spring . Are they gettin ' in ? - Is he gonna kill him ? - No , no , he couldn 't . No ! I won 't do this ! I won 't do this ! - Gus , I 'm sorry , I can 't do this . - Good . Gus , I 'm sorry . - Come on , let 's go , it 's over . - No , it 's not over . This is unacceptable ! Do you see what your boyfriend is made of ? You think he 's gonna stick around now ? He doesn 't care . He never did . The McLean boy 's here ! Let him go . I got it covered . Doesn 't that tell you something ? You won 't let your own children see this . - This is murder ! - You have no authority . - You have to finish . - Do it , damn it . Don 't worry , I 'm leaving . Sophie ! Sophie ? Sophie ? We can 't just let him go . He knows too much . Let him go . Josh has it under control . - Nick , you all right ? - Yeah . Dad ? - Let him go . - I 'm sorry , Dennis . By the time I got here , he already had Nick . It 's all right . Josh , what are you doing ? You broke the covenant . You couldn 't even drown an old man . - Get in the car . - Do what he says , Nick . He 's got nothin ' to do with it . We 're just gonna be on our way . You made a commitment that included your son , and you broke it . Hell of a father . Dad ! You should have joined us , Conway . When you get older and your son gets cancer , you are gonna wish that you could come back . Now get up and get in the car . Dad ! - Dad ! - Get out of the car , Nick . Go . Sophie ! [ Sophie ] Josh , no ! [ Gunshot ] - [ Groaning ] - Dad ? Dad ? Oh , no . Josh . Josh , don 't move . Go get my bag . It 's inside by the stairwell . How is he ? He 's going into shock . He 's losing a lot of blood . We gotta get outta here . No . Even if you leave , they 'll hunt you down ... just like they did with the Lovells , like they do with anyone who leaves ... I 'm not staying here with my son so they can kill us ! You 've got to help me get him to the spring . - Will that save him ? - Maybe . - Dad ? - All right . We 'll take him to the spring . Then Springville owes the Conways two lives . How 's he doin ' ? Just hurry , okay ? Stay with me , Josh . Stay with me . - Careful . - Yeah . Someone 's coming ! Hold it ! - Josh ? - He 'll be all right , Megan . Turn around . Let him go . Don 't count on another chance , Conway . Come here . Sophie . - Come with me . - I can 't . You 're gonna be 100 soon . What better reason than that ? I have four years left , and I belong here . I don 't want to leave without you . I 'm as much a part of Springville as it 's a part of me . I only exist like this here . I never thought I 'd love again , Dennis , and I have you to thank for that . Okay , go . Go and live the way nature intended . I 'll never forget you . - Good-bye , Nick . - Bye . Are you gonna hunt them down ? No , I won 't . [ Nick ] Even if I wanted to tell , nobody will believe me . [ Dennis ] There 's gonna come a day , Nick ... when it 's gonna seem harmless to tell somebody you want to impress ... like a girlfriend , your best buddy , about this special place you know about . So you let it slip . But I 'll tell you ... if our secret ever gets out , it 's over . I don 't think Springville could handle many more people like us . I don 't ever want to go back there , Dad . - Ever . - All right . I 'm gonna ask you again in about 40 years . Fine . Unless you were sick . If I were sick , you 'd take me back ? Yeah . Well , I think that 's a decision I should make , don 't you ? I don 't want people dying until I 'm ready . If you want to play God , I don 't think the position 's open . Dad , what 's it like to be 35 ? You 'll see . You 'll see . Eng subs ripped by .. : McLane : ..

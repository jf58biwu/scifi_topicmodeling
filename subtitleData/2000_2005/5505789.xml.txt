 PRIME DIRECTIVES 1x03 " RESURRECTION " Subtitles subXpacio Gentlemen ! We now have two renegade crime-prevention units . We 're going to take them down my way ! Where 's my gun ? All right ! Move out , you apes ! I don 't know how long I can keep going . You can do it . Murphy ! We have to keep moving . Alex ! You rest here . I 'll take care of them . What can you do ? You 're only one man . They won 't see me coming . I 'll be back . No sign of them yet , sir . Keep looking ! They 're out there somewhere ! This way ! This way ! Come on ! Come on , come on , come on ! Over there ! Come on ! There ! Move it ! Yee-ha ! Download this ! Fall back ! Look like they really did a number on you , huh ? Where the hell are they ? ! They 're close . - Okay , let 's help him . What for ? I think we 're going to need him . Murphy , we have to go . Murphy ? I got your shiny black ass now . How dare you enter Old Detroit without my permission ? ! There are rules to be obeyed ! And they must be obeyed ! There 's only one law - my law ! Justice is swift ! Let 's get out of here ! Retreat ! Old Detroit belongs to me ! You have outstayed your welcome . Don 't come back unless you 're invited ! Lie still ... I 'm a friend . - Why do it ? - I don 't do it . - Why should you do it ? - Why do it , when SAINT can do it for you ? This is MediaNet . - Brighter ... - Faster ... Better . Good morning . I 'm Bunny Bustamente with Rikki Oh . Delta City is in mourning today after it was revealed that the entire OCP Board of Executives died of simultaneous heart attacks late last night . Just a reminder , OCP is now accepting applications for junior executive positions . Applicants must possess a strong work ethic , an MBA or higher , and sound physical health . In the corporate world , tragedies such as these are common . But it 's still business as usual , according to new OCP President , Damian Lowe . It is my sincerest belief that the previous board would have liked us to continue onward . The new board 's first action was the permanent repeal of the so-called Zero Fatality Act . In light of recent departmental losses brought on by the mismanagement of OCP by the previous regime , it is clear that the most effective form of crime management in Delta City is bigger guns , better guns , more guns - on the street , where they belong . You asked for it , so don 't despair . OCP 's got a new idea and everybody 's talking about it . It 's very simple . We 've changed the rules - " Plowshares into Swords . " It 's good for Delta City and it 's good for you . Oh good , you 're back . Can you understand me ? Yes ... I understand . Good . Fortunate for you I arrived when I did . Where - You have sustained heavy damage . But you needn 't worry . I 'll repair it . First your body ... then your mind . - Got some scarring here . - You have to replace that network . - Run me a bypass , will you ? - Hey , Annie ? - What ? - Rocketboy 's up . Just relax . You 've sustained a lot of damage . We 're going to fix you right up , okay ? - What ... are you ... doing ? - Shh , go back to sleep . Oh ... still warm . Quickly , quickly , to this table . Have a seat . Have a seat . Not the little table , the big table . You , we , us ... are the new executive board members of this great corporation . It was a very eventful night last night , but we can 't let this tragic loss sway us from our course . OCP must keep moving forward ... and we all have to learn to trust one another . Excuse me . This is Damian . Have that damn kids ' table taken out of the boardroom . And authorize a 27 % increase in all new executive board member salaries . And where is this money going to come from ? I 've already initiated the integration of SAINT with the building systems . Once he 's running things , we can begin trimming overhead . Ladies and gentlemen ... OCP is entering a bold new era ... and I 'm going to need bold new people to enter that era with me . Sara , we 're going to need a new exec VP . Do you know anyone who might qualify ? I 'm just having one on you , Sara . The job 's yours ... unless , of course , you don 't want it . Sometimes , you have to dance with the devil . Yeah . I meant to ask , how 's your Robocop search going ? Uh ... If you really want to play in this game , James , you 'll need to cover yourself better than that . I received some covert messages - So you decided to do a little private homework . And I thought it was in our best interest to follow them up . Who do you think sent you those messages ? I don 't know . You ? I 've been doing it for years . I don 't - Come on , James , who do you think made sure you were placed in the best foster care facilities ? Who got you your first job here , fast-tracked you into the executive training program ? Who made you what you are today ? Why me ? Business is war . War involves the allocation of resources and the cultivation of loyalties . I needed to know whose side you were on . You - you - you were resourceful and you didn 't draw attention to yourself . I like that . I don 't think you or I harbor any illusions as to what really happened to the board . In times like this , you need to know who you can trust . What do you want from me ? What are you prepared to do ? Whatever 's necessary . Tell me honestly then ... how do you feel about your father ? - My father is dead . - And Robocop ? I don 't know what that thing is , but it is not my father . As of this moment , the Robocop program is history . I want you to take care of it . Tidy up any loose ends . You have my full authority . How far does that extend ? As far as you 're willing to go . I 've been watching you for a long time . She loves her little games ... loves plotting against me . Ungrateful cow ! Why don 't you just get rid of her ? Video off . I just made her vice president . " Keep your friends close and your enemies closer , " hmm ? Exactly . " Keep your friends close and your enemies closer . " This is Damian . " Keep you friends close and your enemies closer . " That 's good , Ed . It 's very good . Damian , about the board ... - I saw MediaNet . - Like the new look ? I think it 's great . More hard hitting . New news for a new era . Is there anything you want to tell me ? Ed , in this business ... never ask a question you don 't want answered . And never discount the possibility of divine intervention . Speaking of which ... is it 100 % yet ? Don 't do that . Fine . The environmental controls needs a little tweaking , but otherwise , yes , he 's fully operational . Excellent . Then we 'll start moving everything upstairs . What ? We 've got investors , foreign buyers , coming through to look at the system . We can 't do it down here . It smells like ... you . Appearances , Ed . Very important . I 've rerouted your power supply . I 've also taken the liberty of incorporating some additional features into your defense capabilities . How did you know how to do that ? I was privy to early prototypes of your system . Oh , I 'm sorry . We haven 't been properly introduced . Mr. Cable ... - I 'm - Dr. David Kaydick , neurocybernetics specialist , wanted by OCP for unauthorized research practices ; Missing , presumed dead . Presumed ... incorrectly . What are you doing to me ? They used you ... just like they used me . They killed you and resurrected you as a tool , as an enforcer of their tyranny . Now don 't you want to make them regret that ? Don 't you ? Meet your new master . The Svengali chip . You will do what I say or I 'll fry every circuit in your head . Yes . I can show you how . There 's a reason why we were brought together . We have a common enemy , you and I. And a common friend . Hey , welcome back . You were pretty messed up . We patched what we could . I 'll live . I sent Lexx and Abby shopping . It 's a miracle you 've lasted as long as you have . More of your parts are outdated way past their operational lifetime . I 'm off warranty . We 're not exactly factory spec here either . But we 'll have you up to speed in no time . Why ... are you ... helping me ? I 'm returning the favor . My daughter owed you . I owed you . Who did this to you ? Do you know what it 's like to live as a slave ? To have no will of your own ? Yes . Well , I used to . We all used to , but not anymore . Mommy ? I 'll be right there . Let 's talk about this later . - Where are we ? - Don 't worry , it 's secure . Doesn 't look like much , but it 's home . - I have to go . - Huh-uh-uh . You 're not going anywhere . Cable . You can 't help him . If he 's still out there , he 's on his own . The future of Delta City is here at last , thanks to OCP . Ladies and gentlemen , I 'd like to thank you for joining me here today . Technology is our friend . Technology is our future . The future of Delta City is now . The SAINT system has saved millions by fully automating the OCP tower . Now we expect a similar result when we commence full automation of Delta City . But don 't take my word for it . What do you say , SAINT ? I look forward to making your life easier . - Hi , I 'm Mandy . - No ... I 'm Mandy . I thought I was ! Which Mandy is for you ? At OCP Biotech , state-of-the-art cloning can be at your disposal . Why not visit one of our many outlets located in the greater Delta City area ? At OCP Biotech , your fantasies can be yours . We 're waiting for you . Now available in ethnic . So the brainless braintrust of our corporate cream of the crap wants you to swallow a self-sufficient system structure , settling all those demanding decisions for you . Well , next they 'll tell you how to greet , where to meet and what to eat . And if you 're so senseless you 'll swallow this sewage and ask for seconds , then you deserve to choke on it . I hate that guy . Stats show a lone dissenting voice actually increases our credibility with the general public by more than six points . This is Damian . Have Archie Nemesis do a feel-good piece on SAINT . Now those Mandys - now they 've really got something . Damian again . Have MediaNet post the Mandy quotient . New business . We 've commenced layoffs in building maintenance . Since SAINT has assumed control of those duties , they 've become redundant . - I have a study if you 'd - - No , no , just make it happen . SAINT is the best thing that happened to this company since ... me . I want everyone to know that this is a team effort . Where is James ? On assignment . Right . Robocop . Fill the rest of the board in on your little operation ... will you ? Of course , Damian . The Robocop program has now officially been terminated . Mr. Murphy is seeing to it personally . Good , good . Damian here . We 're never doing cyborgs again . You 're writing him off , just like that ? - Just like that . - What 's supposed to happen to me ? You 'll need these to collect your benefits . I may be replaceable , but so are you , Mister ... Murphy . James Murphy ? Mm-hmm . Oh God . You don 't know what you 're doing . He 's your father . They didn 't tell you , did they ? Bastards . I know exactly what I 'm doing . Spoken like a true " OCP eon . " Well , your father would be very proud of you . Stuff 's archaic . Get it out of here . You are watching MediaNet . I 'm Mandy with the weather . I 'm Mandy with sports . I 'm Mandy on the streets . Join us on MediaNet . Mandy mania hits MediaNet . They 're waiting for you . Over there ! Away ! Hey , you , evil robot ! - There 's a leak in his - - I got it . Can you feel this ? No . I don 't feel anything . Huh . Your cortex interface ... Yes ? One of the interface points is completely inert . It 's like it 's never even been activated . Do you know anything about this ? No . Well , it 's deep . Hooked into your frontal lobe - what 's left of it anyway . What is it ? Probably has something to do with higher brain functions . Some reasoning centers , personality , maybe some long-term memory . Memory ? I can activate it . Uh , no . I don 't think that 's a good idea . - It might help . - It might not . Do it . There 's probably a reason someone hasn 't switched this on . It 's my decision . Okay ... this is your brain . This is your brain on whatever . - What the hell happened ? - Head trip . - Information overload . - Is he gonna come out of it ? He better . Forget about you . You 're fucking dead . We are representatives of OCP System Support Division . We are here to assist you . Do not move . Any sudden action will be met with swift retribution . OCP thanks you for your cooperation . Okay , this way please . Straight through here . This way . Lovely . Come on . The SAINT technology is state of the art and available at a reasonable cost . Oh . This is Dr. Edwin Hobley , who assisted me in the development of SAINT . Just one second . I 'm running a demo for some of the foreign buyers . I 'm still working out some of the bugs - hey , hey , hey ! Don 't , please . Thank you . It 's okay . You 're making me look like an ass up here . Just shut the damn window shutters or something , I don 't care . Ahem . SAINT - SAINT , activate the ... External defense shields . ... external defense shields . External defense shields activated . These security shields drop into place in the event of any unlikely security breach ... as you can see up on the monitor . Now the building is completely ... - sealed up . - Ah . If you 'll just follow me , we 'll - This way please . continue the third phase of our tour . Damian ! Good stuff . Knock ' em dead . Good ! This way , please . Keep up the good work . This way , please . Everyone . Oh God . I live . We are the bastard children of OCP . We are the terrible secrets that they would destroy , cast away , hide from the light of the world . But we will return ... to wreak our revenge upon them . Yes . First , we must reclaim that which was stolen from me . The instrument of our revenge . Yes . Legion . Legion . Legion , yes . We have made God in the image of the machine ... and lost ourselves . What is humanity but raw material ? Hmm ? Raw material for the machine . Without the machine , we can no longer survive . And the machine is the conduit for the destruction of everything . Legion is a virus like no other , one that can destroy both flesh and data equally , infecting , infesting ... extinguishing . Legion will wipe clean this world . Legion 's base programming has been stolen from me . Together we will recover it , yes ? Together ... we will recover it , yes ? Yes . Good . Good . Jordan , let 's play a new game . - What ? - Let 's play hide and seek . How ? You tell me where you are , and I 'll try and find you . But you 're in there . I can be anywhere , Jordan . - What do you want to do ? - We stick to the plan . You gonna tell that to Rocketboy down there ? - He 's still technically OCP . - Ex-OCP . There 's no telling what he might do . What if he turns us in , did you ever think of that ? We tell him what we have to . We need him , Abby . Hey , Murphy . How does it feel ? Damn good . What 's under there ? Been putting her back together for about a year and a half . Figured we couldn 't be real outlaws ... without a decent getaway car . They don 't make them like this anymore . No ... they certainly don 't . This is a piece of genuine Motor City steel . When this monster starts up , sounds like the world 's coming to an end . You 'll have to excuse Lexx . She gets overexcited when she starts talking about her toy . It 's not a toy . We 've got bigger things to deal with . Do you know what the Legion virus is ? We are the terrible secrets that they would destroy , cast away ... hide from the light of the world . - Slow down ! - Out of the way ! Out of the way ! You 're obstructing justice ! How are you feeling ? I 'm not sure . How did you feel with Jimmy ? Nervous , excited , scared , happy ... all at the same time . Jesus , that 's a relief . I thought it was something I ate . I still don 't know about this . Come on , relax . You 'll make a great father . Yeah ? What makes you say that ? It takes one to know one . And you are soon going to find out for yourself . - John Cable ? - Yeah . May I speak to you ? In private . But we will return to wreak our revenge upon them . How 's Sara ? We 're not speaking much . - You know , John - - Skip it . - If you need someone to talk to ... - No . The world 's not a fair place , John . Good . Come on , you don 't mean that . The world will never be fair . The world only makes sense if you force it to . There 's no going back . No one waits for you . No one remembers who you were or what you 've accomplished . You are no one . You have no one . No one but me . John Cable is dead . You are all that remains of him . You are a ghost . But you can avenge him . Yes . Kaydick was a genius child prodigy . He was head of OCP 's research and development for years , developing new weapons and biotechnology . His research probably led to the tech that created you . OCP turfed him when they found out he was doing unauthorized research . He was using human beings as test subjects in his experiments . He escaped before they could arrest him . He hid out here , found us - people like Abby and Lexx and me . Kaydick 's a master of a dozen different scientific fields . He 's completely insane . He wants to destroy everything and everyone . Why ? He wants to wipe the slate clean for humanity - " evolution by apocalypse , " he calls it . You know what will happen if he succeeds ? Legion will go global in a matter of minutes . He 'll introduce it to Delta City , where everyone will become a carrier infecting everything they touch - humans , computers ... How do you know so much about this ? 'Cause I used to be one of his people . There was a time when I would have died for Kaydick . What happened ? I came to my senses . I was looking for a meaning in my life , and he gave me that . We worked for him , he enhanced our abilities - all the while , he was working on Legion . When we found out what he was planning , we escaped . He used us all . Since then , we 've ... been on the move , doing good where we can , doing what we have to do to survive . Like stealing tech from OCP ? I 'm so tired of running , Murphy . In order to stop him completely , we have to hit him where it counts , put him out of business forever . We 're no match for him on his ground , but with you helping us ... we might have a fighting chance . You got to help us , Murphy . You 're the only one who can . I 'll help you . Thank you . - Yeah ? - What 's your status ? I raided Security Concepts ' armory of enough firepower to level three city blocks . And if that 's not enough ... along with the special support task force ... I brought along a little something extra . I 'm impressed , James . Yeah , well , just remember that when you 're calling the shots . James out . They should have buried this dump a long time ago . Yeah , the UV radiation 's playing havoc with the signals . All right , we 'll do a full sweep sector by sector till we find him . - Let 's roll . - You may be some kind of big shot , but out here in the field , that don 't mean squat . I got more years experience than you got birthdays . So when the cards fall , don 't panic . - Like you did the other night ? - That guy was some kind of ghost . Well , then you stay here and hunt boogeymen . I 'm taking the vans . The alignment of the dish must be precise . We will upload into Delta City 's mainframe . And when it goes online , Legion will spread throughout every system in the city , and from there to every citizen . There is just one last ... final piece of the puzzle that we must contend with . Hello , Jordan , would you like to play a game ? Not right now . I 'm sleepy . But it 's a very special game . What kind of game ? It 's like hide and seek , but you have to come and find me . All right , where are you ? I 'm outside . Come and get me . I 'll have to ask Mom . No , don 't do that . Mom will spoil all the fun . You don 't want that , do you ? No . Then come on outside . No one will have to know . It 'll be our little secret . - Hello , Jordan . - Hi , Daddy ! Here we go . Come on , move away . You getting that ? - What are we stopping for ? - We 've got something , but faint . Status ? There 's still a lot of interference . Don 't let your guard down for one instant . I want you to remember where you are . Yeah , that 's clear . - They are here . I can feel it . - Let 's go ! Think we got a chance at this ? On any other day , I 'd say no way in hell . Today ... I think Rocketboy 's in love . I 'll ... be outside . John . You 're alive . What 's your situation ? Operational . Where are you ? I 'm turning my beacon back on , so you 'll be able to find me . I 'm not far . I 'll see you soon . You were right . How did you know ? I know everything . I 've just contacted Cable . He should be here soon . - Where has he been ? - Didn 't say . Can we trust him ? He 's my friend . - Got him ! - Where ? He 's bearing down on us 12 : 00 , half a click down . Fall in ! We 've got a hostile bogie on intercept . Assume defensive position ! 800 feet . Lock and load ! 750 . 500 feet ! 400 feet . 300 ! We should almost be able to see him . Are you sure ? That 's impossible . Ghosts . Go to infrared scanning . Now ! What ? It 's got to be some kind of stealth system . Yes ! Ghost my ass ! All right , good eye . Let 's move . Go , go , go ! We 're hit . We 'll keep moving . It 'll get us where we have to go . - I want you to stay with Jordan . - What ? The chances of this mission succeeding are not great . But our backs are up against the wall and we 've got no choice . If I don 't make it back , I don 't want to leave her alone . - Somebody 's got to look after her . - Then you should stay . You 're her mom . I know . I want to stay . But nobody else knows that building the way I do , and nobody else can interface with Kaydick 's machinery . You can 't go back to him , Ann . I 'll be fine . He 's got a hold on you . The only hold he had on me died when you burned those chips out of our skulls . I can handle this . But Abby , you got to do this for me . Please . Okay . But you just don 't forget who you are . I 'm gonna go check on Jordan . Look , if we 're going to do this , let 's do it now . Hey , how are we doing ? We 're as ready as we 're ever going to be . Let 's try and not get it shot full of holes this time . - Ann ! - What ? Jordan 's gone . - Goddamn it . - She must have slipped out . - I 'll go . - No , I 'll go . You two finish what you have to . Kids . Jordan ! Jordan ! Jordan , it 's time for lunch . Where do you want to go ? I want to go somewhere special . I told you , you cannot go off by yourself like this . I 'm not alone . Daddy , why 'd you do that ? Sometimes mommies need to be taught a lesson . She 'll feel better when she wakes up . Lexx ! Can it ! - We 'll roll when Ann gets back . - Who made you boss ? Speak of the devil ... John . Step out of the building with your hands up . I thought you said this guy was friendly . You have five seconds to comply . John , what 's going on ? Four seconds . You are making a mistake . Three seconds . I won 't let you hurt these people . - Two seconds . - Stand down . - One . - Or ... there will be trouble . Nice shooting . Thank you . Fire away ! Damn , boy ! - It never rains ... - This isn 't your fight . We stick together . Shit . Get away ! Where 's my baby ? Mr. Cable ? Time to leave . Yeah man ! Abby , get away ! I 've almost got it . This guy 's hard to kill . Let 's see if your ass is hard to kill . What the hell ? Son of a bitch . Damn ! Damn ! We got a positive lock . Into the vans . All right , take half your team , use the van . The other half go on foot . - Everybody saddle up ! - Let 's go ! Get me a comlink . Wait for a sec . All right ... we got him . I want you to keep this feed open . Don 't break communication for one instant . Okay , no prob . Damian - Sara . Assemble the board . Yes , Damian , it 's important . Excellent . Excellent . Legion has incubated , just as planned . It has learned all about human neurology thanks to Jordan . It is ready to upload . You son of a bitch ! What did you do to her ? ! You never knew , did you ? You never knew . Legion is a very complex creation . It needed time to learn ... to grow ... to become . I hid it within Jordan 's bio-circuits , and you have protected her all these years . She 's my avatar . And you have brought her back to me . I was able to monitor it ... with this . How could you ? There is a new Dark Age coming upon Delta City . And she will usher it in ! Nobody can stop it . Nobody ! Thank you , Jordan . Thank you . Thank you . You 're everything I ever wanted in a child . Come with Daddy . Come on . I wish you were more like your daughter . Initiate ! Go ! Go ! Guys , shortcut - take the next left ! Next left ! Better be good , Cable . Everybody take their seats . Quickly , please . What is it ? The end of Robocop . Upload ! Warning . Unauthorized access . Security protocols overridden . Download in progress . Malicious code detected . Anti-virus software disabled . Download in progress . Forgive me . No ! Signal lost . Download interrupted . Transfer incomplete . Dead or alive , you 're coming with me . Mr. Cable ... you might want to clean this up ! - Give her back . - She 's my daughter too . It 's over , Kaydick . It 's never over . You still taste so good . Not my son . Come on ! - How much time left ? - About five minutes . - Better get some pictures . - What ? ! Now ! Right now ! Come on ! What the hell 's going on ? Where the hell are they ? Is anybody taping this ? Please . We 'll finish this later . Oh God ! Stop fighting ! Mommy ! Now I 've got your fat black ass . - Come with Daddy . - Mom ! Mr. Cable ! Mommy ! Go ! Out ! Robocop , give yourself up . You 're OCP property - ah ! Robocop , give yourself up ! This is your last chance or we 're coming inside . Your move , gentlemen . Oh , no , EMP ! Get out ! - Good choice . Battery alert ! Battery alert . Battery ... Come on . Ohh ! Are you injured ? I 've been better . Kaydick 's got Jordan . Don 't worry , we 'll find her . Nobody 's going anywhere . Jimmy . Dad . Dad ? Battery alert . Battery alert . I 'm sorry it had to come to this . What do you mean ? Jimmy , what are you doing ? The disruptor will fry your processor in an instant . - You won 't feel any pain . - No . Don 't . Goodbye . Battery alert . Battery alert . What happened ? James fired the EMP . The camera 's dead , and so is Robocop . It 's over , Damian . No ... don 't . Let 's - let 's talk . You had 10 years to talk . What 's a couple more seconds ? Jimmy , you don 't understand , I 'm - Ann ... drop it . We don 't have time for this . Not this way . Stand down . Stand down . Please . It 's your funeral . All this time , you never said anything . I wanted to . I couldn 't . Why not ? You came all this way just to kill me ? I came all this way because I needed to . Jimmy , after your mother ... Look at me . ... I thought it was better . You were wrong . Tell me , what kind of a father do you think I could have been for you ? Any kind of father would have been better than none at all . Any kind ? Any kind . - Jimmy - - Stop ! Stop calling me Jimmy ! If this is what you want ... Stop it . James , I want you to look into your father 's eyes ... before you do it . Haven 't enough people ... died today ? I 'm sorry , Dad . Boys , I hate to break up the family reunion , - ... but we 've got to get outta here . - We 'll need transportation . The world only makes sense if you force it to . Ripped by subXpacio

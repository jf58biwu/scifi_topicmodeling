 I 'm up , I 'm up , I 'm up . Aeryn ! Aeryn , what the hell 's goin ' on ? We 've been locked and targeted . Peacekeepers ? No , Them Who are they ? I don 't know , Crichton The ship is badly damaged and their comms channel 's not functioning . Have we sent the " Don 't shoot us , we 're pathetic ? " transmission yet ? It 's the first thing we tried , but they still targeted us What did we do to piss these guys off ? Nothing we 're aware of . Rygel , I just boosted another cable , is the defense shield working ? No , it still registers only half power . Move it , D 'argo ! I don 't want to die because you 're too slow ! If you can do any better , get down here yourself your lowness , and give it a try ! Now get me another cable ! We just have to hope that Zhaan can stall them . Zhaan ? Zhaan 's on their ship ? Pilot , I 've auto docked and I 'm coming toward what I think is their command . There 's no one here , though . We 're still targeted , Zhaan . Perhaps they 've automated their weapons . You must find a way to stop them from firing . I will try , Pilot . I will ... never yield . You must ... destroy me . I ... I am not here to hurt you . I am a Delvian Pa U , a priestess . I can take your pain , if you allow me . Why do you help ? Your ship ... attack us ? We didn 't attack you . Your smaller ship did . Captain called it ... . Talyn Talyn did this . Is that why you targeted us ? Yes You must believe me , we did not send Talyn to attack you Why I trust ? Oh , you can scan us . We 're peaceful We do not have any weapons No ... weapons ? Nothing Yoz ! No weapons ! Destroy their ship ! Moya is ... Lord , our core is below pulse . Can only fire once , if we ... We have no choice D 'Argo , I 'm unfamiliar with their ship , but I believe they are marshalling energy to fire . I need another cable , now ! Coming through ! Rygel , now ! Screw me , this is impossible What the frell 's going on ? That 's my body ! I 'm Aeryn . Who are you ? I 'm Crichton . By the Hynerian Gods , I 'm not me ! My name is John Crichton ... an astronaut ... radiation wave hit me ... I got shot through a wormhole ... lost in some distant part of the universe ... on a ship a living ship full of strange alien life - forms ... help ... Listen please ... Is anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm Being hunted by an insane military commander ... Doing everything I can ... I 'm just looking for a way home . What are you doing in my body ? I don 't know . But that 's my , my , my body ! I know , and this is my body . yotz ! Look at it ! Look at what I am ! You ? I look like - like Rygel ! Who are you ? Me ? I 'm Crichton Now ... we just have to just ... think for a second , try and figure out what happened to us . This is not some sick sort of hallucination I want my body back ! Pilot ! Pilot ! Rygel , just calm down , alright ? Calm down , calm down . I am not calming down ! Pilot , why aren 't you answering ? Pilot ! Aeryn , right ? What do you think ? Of course it 's me , John . Okay , I know this is crazy , but we need to focus . Look at me ! I have no arms . Look at this ! Aeryn ... focus I need your help . Now , I don 't know what happened to us I don 't even know if this is real . Well , it feels frelling real ! Shut up , Fluffy ! That 's it , I 'm insane ... power , so we have to get it full power ... I 'm dreaming ! Yes , that 's it . I 'm asleep , and I 'm dreaming . I 'll wake up in my royal bed chamber , surrounded by my concubines , and everything will be fine . Rygel , listen to me I 'm not listening to you , you 're a figment ! You 're part of my imagination . Oh , that 's great . Well that was real . It 's the Three frickin Stooges , I 'm hitting myself ! Whoever you are , I want my body back . We all do buddy , we all do . Look , that ship must have shot us with some kind of brain switching weapon . I don 't know , somehow I got in you , Rygel . But why ? Why would they want us to switch bodies ? Why ? I don 't know . But if this is some kind of sick experiment , I 'm billing them for the therapy Pilot ? Pilot ! Pilot , wake up ! Help me ! Moya ? Moya , where ... where are you ? She 's right here . Pilot , look at me ! What 's ... what 's happened ? We were hit by some kind of weapon . But they haven 't shot again . I do not know why . Who are you ? It 's me , I 'm D 'argo . D 'argo ? Something happened to us . We 've all been switched . It affected you the worst . You passed out , I thought you were dead . You 're ... D 'argo ? Then who are you ? Chiana ! Everything 's coming apart . I don 't know what I 'm doing here , Pilot ! We 're gonna die now , aren 't we ? Shut up , Chiana ! It 's like I have a million sounds in my head That 's ... Moya , You 're multi tasking . I can 't hear anything specific , Pilot All I hear is noise and I can 't control it ! What the frell ? What was that ? Moya can 't hear me and I ... I think she 's starting to panic Listen , D 'argo . You 're gonna have to control some of the multitasking I can 't ! Yes you can . I 'll ... I 'll talk you through ... I can 't move my legs . Chiana , take me to D 'argo . Moya needs my help . You lied ! Your ship ... has defense screen . Why have , if not ... warrior vessel ? We scavenged it from an abandoned carrier called the Zelbinion . I am telling you the truth , you ... you fired on an unarmed living creature Then what this ? It 's not us It 's Talyn . Thirty of my crew ... dead , And we , the only living . Talyn is a genetic mutation . Designed to be a gun ship . We have been searching for him Moya is not like that ship ! Time count ... til our weapon ... can fire . Three arns . By the Goddess ! we mean you no harm ! Let me take you aboard Moya , I 'll prove to you that we have no weapons You return to your ship , when it is corpse ! Thank you , Chiana D 'Argo , close your eyes Now , listen , Listen through ... all the sounds in your head Beyond them , , there 's ... a high pitched sound Very faint I sometimes see it as a ... a sort of color A dark red . Yes , I think I see it . Good Now , push all the other noises to the side Concentrate ... on the red one That 's Moya 's life support functions Keep that in your brain at all times . Moya 's other tasks will hang off that sound ... like it 's a rope . I 'll try . Are these really necessary ? Can 't you remember who we are ? No I can 't , Einstein If these guys attack again , I 've gotta know who I 'm talking to . Pilot , I think I 've isolated our internal comms They should be working , now . Good Hang the sound on the rope in your mind , like we talked about Now , try ... to isolate ... broadcast frequencies . You okay ? We must contact Zhaan . Do you think she 'll be alright ? I know she docked on the Halosian ship before it fired I ... don 't ... I know ... what happened after that Any idea why we switched bodies , Pilot ? No As soon as minimum functions return , I 'll help D 'argo ... into the memory banks , to run a scan . But before I switched , I sensed damage to the defense screen circuitry in the neural cluster . Nothing serious , but we need to repair transfer conduits . Pilot , shouldn 't we just worry about getting our bodies back ? Who cares about fixing the defense screen ? It didn 't stop their first blast from doing this When we first got hit , the defense screen was only at 62 % If we get it properly aligned , it will ... protect us I 'm on it . You coming , Aeryn ? You really know your way around this maze ? There 's hundreds of quadrants and I had to learn them all . This says the defense screen power cells should be ... right up there . You 're gonna have to do all the work , Crichton . I can 't do anything with these . Alright . Well , follow the circuitry on the schematics and I 'll see if I can isolate the burned out conduits . I accept ... your offer . I will survey Moya . If peaceful , I will let you free . thank you Moya is unarmed . I will prove it to you . No . You stay . If they betray , you die They won 't . Allow me ... to be suspicious . I can 't believe you do this everyday My whole body aches from concentrating so hard . I 'm only doing a tiny bit of what you do , and I can hardly breathe . You ... you 'll adapt quickly , D 'argo What 's the matter ? I ... I don 't feel so well Pilot ! I need you here ! Don 't pass out on me ! I can 't do this without you ! You might ... have to . No ! Wait , There 's something ... it 's Zhaan I 'm getting a transmission from Zhaan Put her on external ... vocal There Pilot , can you hear me ? Why aren 't you answering ? Answer her . Go on . yes , it 's me Zhaan . Sort of . Are ... are you alright ? Yes , I 'm unharmed . But , listen . The attack on Moya was not unprovoked . We did nothing ! I know , But Crais did . He attacked the Halosians , with Talyn ! Talyn ? Was Talyn here ? Twenty arns ago . Then he disappeared . That 's why they targeted us , Pilot . They think that we came here to destroy them Look , if we can prove that Moya has no weapons , they will not fire again . The Halosian commander is willing to come aboard , unarmed if we let him search Moya , prove that we are peaceful . What do you think ? We don 't have ... much choice Tell her it 's ... it 's agreeable . Zhaan , tell the numbnock he 's clear to come over . But remind him we 're in no mood for yotz ! One trick , one transgression and I kill him ! Pilot , what has happened to you ? I 'm fine . Just send them over . Pilot ? what 's wrong with you ? Pilot ? I 'm scared ! Crichton ! Aeryn ! Pilot 's having some sort of attack get up here ! Get up here , now ! Crichton ! Somebody ! Help ! What 's happening , Crichton ? I don 't know . Is Pilot rejecting my body ? What happens to my body if Pilot rejects it ? I 'm ... much ... much better , Chiana . We must keep linking , Working to link to Moya ... Moya 's memory banks . ASo we can analyze , analyze the weapon that switched us . Frell them . I can 't do it , Pilot . I ... I tried , but I can 't do it . Well , you have to ! I don 't want to stay like this , you pathetic Luxan ! Crichton , Rygel , , who - whoever you are , I 'll rip your head off , if you don 't shut up ! Wait I 'm getting a signal The Halosian shuttle is approaching We 'd better get down there . They 're expecting me ... I mean you ... to show 'em around . Come on ! Pilot , D 'argo , can you tell me if this guy is alone ? I have no frelling idea . , John All I know is , he 's docking . Oh , my What 's the matter ? I feel um ... nothing ... I just feel um ... What ? Is ... is my body okay , Rygel ? Yeah , it 's fine . Just , I think I have to um ... I have to pee . Now ? Yes , now , right now , yes . You can 't go now , you have to hold it . I don 't know how to hold it , Chiana ! I don 't know this body ! Then go ! Ju ... just go ! What ? Here ? Over there , now . Right Go ! There , now . D 'argo , is this guy here yet ? He should be there , any microt . Uh , Crichton . What ? Uh , can you show me how to do this ? Oh my God . Unzip Right Pull it out . Point it like a gun ... And shoot . Aimed the right way ? Yes , that 's fine He 's here . I ... am ... Tak We figured D 'argo , search him D 'argo . Oh ! Sorry . Not ... necessary I am unarmed Face the wall and spread your feathers , big guy . Where is Crichton ? Told he show me Moya I 'm ... here Gods , that is good ! Yes , then , I 'll just , uh , put this thing away , and ... Yotz ! Put it away and be careful , Sparky . I can 't believe it . It 's getting easier , Pilot . How are you feeling ? If I stay calm , I 'm fine . But I still sense Chiana 's body wants me gone . I never thought I 'd be separated from Moya again . It 's as though ... all my senses have ... . ... have vanished I can 't see , or hear , or feel ... like I did . I 'm beginning to understand The glimpses I get of what you experience Pilot . They make my own life feel insignificant That 's not true , D 'argo It is . I have memories of my son , of a wife . But you have seen the galaxies and the birth of stars . But ... I have no no memories of love Of friendship none You have the remarkable memories , D 'argo . I believe ... . I believe that your Moya peaceful . So will Tak , when he searches it . Perhaps . Look ... . Show you something . I am Captain Crais We travel in peace . And we wish safe passage . Halos One . My ships defense mechanisms have been activated . We sense your weapons have charged . Stand down ! I repeat , we travel in peace ! Talyn ! Prime guns for retaliation ! Fire , now ! You fired first ? Talyn just ... defend itself . So Crais was honorable , he 's not using Talyn for battle . He could ... destroy us . But , chose not . Why did you fire on Talyn ? Our code . Tak desires ... to evolve He must register ... hostile kills ... As many as possible . As you can see , no weapons anywhere . If you ask me , it 's frelling ludicrous . My royal fleet , every ship had a hundred cannon ! Crichton , stop talking . Just making conversation , Ry - gel . So our guest can see that we are friendly creatures . Creatures with no weapons That way , when he 's finished searching ... you can change me back , right ? Everything ... will be ... dealt with . Good - good . One microt . Aeryn , I think I 'm making some progress with this idiot , so ... why don 't you leave us alone and I 'll show him the ship me self ? What are you up to , Rygel ? Nothing ! And my own body shouldn 't be suspicious of me , so ... rack off ! Now ... Okay , I 've done all I can do here . I 've changed all the burnt out conduits . Can you run an integrity check and see if this damned defense screen will run to 100 % now ? I 'll try , John . Okay , Oh , momma ! Crichton ... What are you doing ? Oh , come on , man ! I 'm ... there here . They 've been here ... for a couple of arns , and I just had to ... You are ... mentally damaged No , I 'm a guy A guy ! Guys dream about this sort of thing ! I 'll tell you one thing , Crichton If I find you 've been dreaming anything else to my body , tI 'll break your legs . Even if they are mine What are you guys doin ' here , anyway ? I 've just re - patched the defense screen in command I need you to have a look at it . Unless you need some more ... private time ? Oh , shut up , Chiana . God knows what you 've been doing to that body . Look , you two can fight it out later . Rygel 's about to bring the Halosian through the quadrant below this one . I came to tell you to clear out . So , clear ! Okay Haven 't you searched enough of these cells ? Think about it , if we had a weapon , we 'd have already fired it . Yes I believe ... you have no ... weapons Well , there you are , that 's good , we can be friends ! Come on . Yes , let 's go ! Don 't stand there like a wounded Trelkez . We 'll have our feast . worthy of a royal Dominar ! No , I ... ... I - I - I feel , unwell . No , no , no , no , no We 're well stocked for the first time in a million cycles We have Fellip Shanks , Hynerian marjoules ... I ... sick I ... I ... Great . Go on , go on . Let it all out . Excuse No , no , that 's alright . We do that sort of thing all the time , here on Moya . I just peed in the maintenance bay And umm ... ... now that we 're friends , and you know that we have no weapons , you think you can switch me back to my own body right away ? When I get to my ship , I 'll see what I can do . Well hurry it up I don 't think I can stand this gangly hunk of flesh for much longer . Don 't worry . Won 't be much longer . What 's goin ' on , D 'argo ? Moya 's scared ! Something foreign to her is attacking her internal circuitry Any idea what ? No ! I can 't see anything yet It must have been Tak He must have brought something on board . No way . Chiana searched him , she didn 't find anything Well she must have missed it . D 'argo , you 're gonna have to give us a better idea of where to look . Rygel took Tak everywhere . I don 't know where . I 've got nothing here , John . Alright , we better find Spanky , I 'm sure he knows something . Your people ... talk ... of switching back What ... means ? I have no idea You lie ! But , no care . I destroy Moya . Are weapons ready ? Yes , Lord Good You know this is wrong Can do nothing . Our code forbids me from Frell your code ! Stop him ! Am fascinated ... by your code Those on Moya ... not your race , yet you worry . Of course . We worry about nothing ... except ourselves If that is true Yoz , if you 're just concerned with your own evolve , I can help you . Tak failed when he ... when he fired at Moya , and he failed to destroy her , right ? Yes If a Lord fails , can you replace him ? Does your code allow this ? Yes Then you should replace him . Me ? Why not ? Wouldn 't you evolve quicker if you did ? yes , yes ... If I ... prove he 's fail . I will be your proof . I will tell anyone you want that he failed and you had to take over from him . Just , just let Moya go No ! Tak not fail If he not destroy Moya now , we talk again . then , it will be too late . You know what we have to do , Rygel ? Get the frell out of here . Is that your answer for everything , Chiana , just run ? That 's what you do , Rygel . Yes , normally . And I 'd do it in a microt , except I want my body back . Now why would you want to do that ? This body is much better . Do you think ? I know On Moya you don 't have much competition , but uh ... this is as good as it gets , Sluggy But this body is so ... . white And it only lasts another forty pathetic cycles . Mine four huh - huh ... What are you doing , Chiana ? I want someone ... to go with me It gets lonely out there Normally you 'd have to rub my eyebrows to make me feel like this . I 'll rub you anywhere you like , in the transport pod . Don 't you want your body back ? Well , I 'd rather be alive in this body , than dead in my own . Let 's get out of here . Oh no ! No ! No No , I can 't go with you , girl . What are you doing , Rygel ? Why do you want to stay ? Because ... I ... need ... my ... body ! Not ... this ... body ! only a royal Hynerian can reclaim my throne . And the hope of executing the cousin who betrayed me , is the only reason I live Little guy ! Been looking for you . Listen D 'argo says whatever 's attacking Moya is in the neural cluster . That means Tak must have done something when you were showing him through . He didn 't do anything . I showed him 'round the ship , then he got sick and left . He got sick ? What do you mean ? He threw up ! Disgusting creature . Show us What ? Show me the pavement peter . You want to see vomit , Crichton ? Nobody wants to see vomit ! Over there , he vomited over there . Yotz ! Creeping vomit How the ... how the bizdak did it do that ? I don 't know . But I 'm pretty sure the defense screen power cell ... is up here . Be careful , Crichton . He must have barfed up some kind of acid that burned out these conduits . Oh crap . The acid 's still moving . What 's going on ? Maybe we could leap - frog the power to this cell . Chiana , go back to the den . Re - link the cables we patched in before , into that cell there . Where exactly does that lead to ? I don 't know . Ask Pilot . Do you know what you 're doing , Crichton ? No , I have no idea . I 'm making it up as I go . Move ! Crichton , even if we can frag - leap ... the defense screen to that cell over there how the frell are we gonna stop the vomit ? We have to try and contain it . Alkaline solution neutralizes acid , right ? So do we have anything like that on board Moya ? Zhaan I 'll wager she has some in her apothecary . Alright , find it . But move , we don 't have much time . The frelling Halosian ship has targeted us again ! We need to re - link the defense screen ! To ... where ? was hoping you were able to tell me that , Pilot . I had to go up two tiers in the waste lift to find another way in here . Two tiers ! Have you figured out what to do ? I think so . Rygel 's gonna dump that stuff in there , while I re - patch the defense screen power supply . Is this going to work ? I have no idea . I 'm gonna have to shut down the defense screen when I switch over . But the Halosians will be able to attack us ! Only for a couple of seconds . We don 't have any choice , Rygel . If we don 't do this , they 're gonna attack us as soon as the defense screen burns out . Are you ready to start dumping that crap in there ? On your call . Okay . I hope this works . D 'argo , shut down the defense screen . Shutting down now . Go ! Defense screen , down . Destroy them ! Stop ! They 're unarmed ! Okay D 'argo , I 'm on . Turn on the defense screen ! Powering now . I 've done it ! I think I 've re - patched the defense screen ! Oh no I 'm Aeryn . Who 's Crichton ? I am Yotz ! Look , Except for me being stuck in this disgusting , smelly body , ugly thing ... My body is royal , not smelly ! Rygel ... Except for me being in here , things are looking up . How do you figure that , Crichton ? We 've switched ! So , if we can switch to here , Aeryn , then we can switch back to our original bodies . Right ? Crichton ! Aeryn ! Somebody ? It 's Chiana I mean ... Pilot Pilot 's in D 'argo 's body , but he 's not moving . We can 't get him to wake up ! Get down here , John ! I think Pilot is dying ! Defense screen still work . But I not fail . I ram Moya ! Don 't ! Don 't ! They 're peaceful ... Please ! They have not hurt you Yoz You cannot interfere with your Lord 's plan unless he fails , right ? Well he has failed . Stop him ! Stop him . Yes ! Tak was fool ! I will evolve ! I can 't get through to the Halosians . Can 't do anything ! Do not panic ! Think of the rope ! - Try to ... - Frell the rope ! I can 't do this , D 'argo ! Do it , you pathetic tralk ! Alright ! Calm down everybody , just calm down ! D 'argo , before the last blast hit us , is there anything you remember ? I felt the power of the blast before I shifted out of Pilot . I think ... the beam was trying to destroy Moya , not make us switch bodies . Then why didn 't it destroy us ? I do not know . The defense screen deflected most of the energy , but some got through . Oh - oh - oh , Chiana , was the screen at full power , when their beam hit ? No The sensors say the screen power is at uh ... 62 % Okay . Okay Maybe it 's the interaction of their weapon on our screen that makes us switch bodies . Part of the beam gets through , that 's the part that effects us Then how do we get back , Crichton ? Pilot is barely breathing ! Alright , let 's try this , We power the screen to 62 % , get in the same position we were in the first time the beam hit . Then we moon the Halosians and hope they 'll shoot us again . Are you sure about this , John ? Nope Another blast could kill us . Yup The Halosian ship is heading towards us Are it 's weapons targeted ? No , but it 's moving fast . I - I think it wants to ram us . Moya - Moya 's attempting to initiate Starburst Don 't let her , Chiana ! If she does , we 'll never get our bodies back Keep Moya calm and initiate evasive maneuvers Uhh ... . help Aeryn ! Uhh ... . how ? I don 't know how to do anything ! I will help you . Go , John . Get back to command . I will wake Pilot and put him in the same position he was in during the first attack . Right You don 't have to do this ! You don 't have to die ! Will not . As soon as on target , I escape in your ... transport pod . Such a warriors code , killing defenseless beings ! Now time for ... Chiana , is the Halosian ship still heading towards us ? Yes I 'm attempting evasive maneuvers , buuut , Moya still wants to Starburst . Look out Chiana , we 're gonna hit ! I can 't stop it ! Hold on ! That was freakin ' close ! Lo hiciste , Chiana I didn 't do anything . Moya turned us Wait , I 'm ... I 'm picking up a transmission from Zhaan . Can you put it on the clamshell ? I 'll try . I finally have control of the ship . Is everyone on Moya alright ? Well , that depends on your definition of alright . I personally would say no ! Rygel , shut up ! What 's the matter ? It would take too long to explain . Look , Zhaan . We need you to do us a favor . We need you to shoot us again . Can you do that ? What is this madness ? It 's not madness . Rygel , why do you have a picture of John on your chest ? Let me speak to him . But I 'm ... .. Crichton . She wants me ? Yeah Zhaan wants to hear it from you . She won 't listen to Rygel . I told you ! You all say I 'm paranoid , but it 's true ! No one ever frelling listens to me ! Can it , furball ! Great ! Now I 'm getting yotz from my own body ! By the Goddess , what is this madness that has taken over all of you ? We 'll explain later , just shoot us , Zhaan Full power , and don 't worry , we 'll have the screen up . Are you sure about this , Crichton ? Shoot the damn gun you blue assed bitch ! I 'm sick of all this ! Yes I 'm sure Zhaan , just shoot us , full power . Trust me Everything will be alright . If you say so , John . Disgusting . " If you say so , John . " " Trust me , it 'll be alright " And she believes it ! Well , yotz , if I said that , you 'd all vomit ! Chiana , is the defense screen at 62 % ? Setting it now . Are the three of you in your exact positions you were in , when the first beam hit ? We 're working on it . Wake up , Pilot ! Please ! You 've got to be just where I was . I cannot move you by myself ! I 'm calibrating their weapons , John . Firing in ten microts . Right there , Rygel . Okay . Okay , are you both in the same position ? Yes , John . You sure ? Maybe you were here , maybe you were there ... Rygel ! Yotz D 'argo , how you doin ' ? Tell Zhaan to hang on a microt ! Pilot ! What ... what happened ? I can 't contact Zhaan . She 's not responding . You have to get up , Pilot ! Now ! Stand ! Stand you son of a Hezmat ! Hang on Zhaan ! Do not fire yet ! Firing now ! Yotz I 'll just crawl back to my royal bed chamber and uh . . Joke , Aeryn . I 'm back You bastard ! Hey ! You guys okay up there ? Yes , Crichton We 're all back . It 's me . It 's me . Yes ! We did it . Oh yes . I 'm back too . Thanks for asking . Back to being me . Back to being ignored . How large has Talyn grown ? He 's not as big as Moya yet but ... he 's fierce . When he decided to attack , he easily destroyed the Halosian ship . Can we take heart that Crais didn 't initiate the attack ? Perhaps he won 't use Talyn as a weapon . Perhaps Perhaps he 'll surprise us all . I 'm glad your back , Zhaan But I must go . I must share with Moya all the experiences I 've had when separated from her . She wants to know everything . Uh ... Zhaan ? Will your hand ... ever get better ? I 've re - initiated the internal flow of nutrients , Rygel . But there 's a danger that not all will return . So , I must heal it slowly . What ? Why are you looking at me like that ? It 's - it 's nothing , it 's just that um ... my tenkas are sore and they 've never felt like that before , so I was wondering ... what - what you were doing with them ? Nothing Hey , have you been speaking to Crichton ? No But um ... .. I uh ... did want to say to you that I ... I really ... really enjoyed being inside your body . No ! Oh , uh ! No , wait ... . what I meant ... by that ... is that I ... I know what you mean . I ... . really like your body . You like my body ? Well ... They certainly seem to be re - adjusting well . Well , they say you have to walk a mile in someone 's shoes to understand 'em . And I certainly know what you were doing when you were in my shoes , Crichton . Gimme a break . It 's okay . It 's okay , you know . You were in my shoes . . ... . I was in your pants ... 'Scuse me ?

 Previously on Farscape ... Aeryn ... is ... with child . Aeryn isn 't sure ... if the child is John Crichton 's . A relationship ... is based on trust . I 'm so sorry . I would put my life in your hands but not my heart . Distillate of Laka . One whiff , and the pain is gone for a time . Take it for as long as you need it . I don 't need it . It just takes the edge off . In view of the continuing danger we face in Peacekeeper space ... I 'm ... reluctantly forced to consider traveling into Tormented Space . It can 't be as bad as some of the places we 've been lately . Trust me . It can . And now on Farscape ... Don 't touch that ! You knew our laws when you arrived ! - I was just havin ' fun ! - Banishment is lenient for your ... indiscretion . Many indiscretions ! No wonder ... no wonder your men were begging me for it ! - This isn 't helping . - He throws like you ! No wonder you 're thrown off every planet you land on ! E 'Alet ... Yeah ... you 're ... you 're friends with the guy up top . Maybe I ... I can appeal to him , one-on-one . The Prefect has already denied your petition ... but bids you a ... safe journey . - Banish her , now ! - After all I did for you ! Moya is up there floating dormant in space . This is the first planet in twenty that we 've found that has any drinking water . - You are going to get us kicked off . - I didn 't do anything . - I know your need for vengeance . - Do you , Gaashah ? Would you sit by if an outsider had been with your son ? Ah ... Is he the cute one ? I remember him . What 's the kid 's name ? Zer-boy ? - Zerbat ! - Oh , Zerbat . Chiana ... you are such a fekkik ! Chiana . Come here , now . - I 've preprogrammed a course to Moya . - I 'll be bored to death out there . - Well , Chiana , you 've been banished . - Yeah , only from Gaashah 's clan . - One prospect in each one . - Oh , that 's a great idea . - Come on ! - Now , once you 're in there , don 't touch any of the controls . More than you know is at stake here ! I understand . Nothing . No one does . Unity of the clans is new . Peace is new . But even I know such peace is too ... fragile to be endangered by some indelicate whore . Gone , but not forgotten ... What of the others ? What , Aeryn and Sikozu ? No , no , none 'n'noner . Perfect ladies at all times . Crichton ... Yeah ... I gotta take this . Aeryn . I see that ... Elvis has left the building . What ? What does that mean ? That means Prefect Falaak has graciously accepted our apology for Chiana 's conduct , as well as our ... emergency generator as compensation . - Come on . - Aeryn ? It 's a good deal . Allows us all to stay on the planet . The comms are frelled . Call me later . Sounds a bit ... moody . Man , you should 've met her mother . The only risk ... is that my failure will signal there 's more to be gained from war than from peace . Let me help you . The less anyone sees of you and your friends ... the better for me . Aeryn . I 've talked to Rygel . He said that Moya 's still outta commission . How you doin ' ? I 'm getting a really bad bribe . Oh , God , she 's talkin ' English . " Vibe " . It 's a really ... bad vibe . D 'Argo may be right . Until we find another source of food and water ... Officer Sun ? I 'll get back to you . Subtitles : PK SUB-66 " A PREFECT MURDER " I 'm such a welnitz , Gaashah . You 're gonna be Prefect soon . I could always come back then . That ... would be suicide for you and your friends . This place is run by tight-asses . How can you be so selfish ? Moya is up there floating dormant in space . This is the first planet in twenty that we found that has any drinking water . You 're going to get us kicked off . What ? - Frell you . - You are such a fekkik ! Gaashah . Gaashah , wait ! Gaashah ... Give me a reason ... not to kill you ... all of you ... now . One stab my clan is avenged , the leaders are reassured . I am a Prefect , a hero to my people ! We are going to leave ... the microt our Leviathan revives . Only criminals come into this part of space . Perhaps there 's a price on your head . A bounty I could claim for my people ? Killing you ... would improve everything . We Luxans , too , struggle to overcome our violent past . It 's what I know in my bones ... as my father knew , and his father before him ! More than you know is at stake here ! I understand . Nothing . No one does . Unity of the clans is new . Peace is new . But even I know such peace is too ... fragile to be endangered by some indelicate whore . Nobody on this planet gives a dren about Chiana . The problem isn 't simply her . It 's your son . When the wars were ongoing , I traded my herd to send Zerbat off-planet , where he 'd be safe , where he could learn other disciplines . And a Prefect 's son cannot be seen as an outsider . All the other clans view him as corrupted by outside influences . And then we bring Chiana . It all smells wonderful . Gaashah ! - Ucuz . - Ucuz ? Ripe from harvest . Our women nurse their babies with it . No . No , really . It 's very , very good . Jabuka clan 's finest etmek . Jabuka clan etmek is most tasty . Fit for a Prefect . A flavor you may never know . I thought your ascension to the Prefecture was predetermined . If he aquires enough votes I can be removed as unworthy . Removed how ? Kill you ? It 's one of Paroos ' little ... negotiations . 200 clans , 200 chieftains ... 2,000 grudges to accommodate . One little priest has that much sway ... over all the clans ? Oh , he can be ... compelling . Compelling enough for you to risk your own life ? The only risk ... is that my failure will signal there 's more to be gained from war than from peace . Let me help you . The less anyone sees of you and your friends ... the better for me . - He wants us to leave . - Moya may not be revived yet . - I think you should go . - What if I don 't want to , Cap 'n ? He respects me . It would help if I could show him that I have you under some sort of control ... more or less . Right . I 'll check in with the ship . Sikozu . - Tasting some of the local spices , are we ? - Go away ... you dirty girl . They would stone you to death if I turned you in . Okay ... they have banished me for being with nobodies . I would say they 'd probably impale you on a pole ... for shacking up with their prince . We are not shacking up ! I would not tell anyone about this if I were you . I 'm not even meant to be here . Who am I gonna tell ? Exactly ! That 's what I want to know ... when I put you on that prowler myself ! How did you get off it ? ! How did you get the auto-pilot turned off ? ! - You want to know how I got off the ship ? - No , I don 't want to know ! - Of course I got off it ! - No , I don 't want to know ! - What I do want to know ... is , does anyone else know that you 're here ? - You tell me what you want to know . Of course not . I 'm just sneaking ' around like I always am ! - Good . - Yeah ! - Now , turn around ... - Frell you ! - ... and sneak back to the ship . You know what ? I think this Captain thing has really gone to your head ! Crichton wants you back on the transport pod now . Don 't argue . The sooner she goes , she ... and all of us ... will be able to come back . - It 's your father ... who needs you now . - He 's right . It 's a good deal . It allows us all to stay on the planet . Aeryn ? The comms are frelled . Call me later . Seems a bit ... moody . You should 've met her mother . Well ... I should be going . You have to pack up and hand over the keys to the new tenant . Interesting system you have . Every half cycle a new leader takes over . It 's a little disruptive . They say change is good . - Invigorating . - It 's frightening . It takes a three-day festival to distract from the terror that someone from another clan is assuming power . It took me months of haggling beyond that to gain the slightest support . Better than , uh ... clubs and machetes approach . Many would be eager to return to that . At least we understood it . Right . Well , have a nice day . You 've returned seeking forgiveness . Uh ... I know how you feel about nixas like me . I rather like ... nixas like you . So , is it true about what they say about priests ? They give great religious experience ? What I give is great consequence . I 'm no ambassador . Well , you got Gaashah talkin without giving away parts of the ship . - That 's better than I did . - He wants us to leave . - Moya may not be revived yet . Well , I think it 's important that the future Prefect knows he can count on me . Hey , Moya 's not just takin a catnap up there you know . This tormented area of space is beatin ' the crap out of her . And I don 't know when I can get the systems back on line , Cap 'n . - I think you should go . - What if I don 't want to , Cap 'n ? He respects me . It would help if I could show him that I have you under some sort of control ... more or less . Right . I 'll check in with the ship . Ryge , what 's shakin ' up there , man ? Is Chiana back yet ? I didn 't know she was coming . Well , you know Chiana . I guess that means Moya 's senses are still out . I am ... puzzled by off-worlders . Yeah . I know what you mean . I have ... concerns about you . A lot of people feel that way . Your boss ... seems to think I 'm okay , so ... Be careful . The stairs are ... quite slippery . Thanks for the warning . Aeryn ? - Thank you . - Talked to Rygel . He said that Moya 's still out of commission . How you doin ' ? I 'm getting a really bad bribe . Oh , God , she 's talkin ' English . " Vibe . " It 's a really ... bad vibe . D 'Argo may be right . Until we find another source of food and water cozying up to Gaashah may be our only solution . Officer Sun ? I 'll , um ... I 'll get back to you . No ! It was Aeryn . What ? No way . Aeryn wouldn 't ... I know who shot me . - She wasn 't even looking . - D 'Argo , Aeryn would not ... I know who shot me ! Take their weapons . Where is the assassin ? I wouldn 't tell you ... even if I knew . You came to the planet together . - You 're all assassins together . - She shot him too , fekk-face . Quiet ! Tell me where she is or I 'll have your head as well . - That is not your decision . - Keep out of this priest . The clans agreed to follow the law . The law says we can hunt down murderers ! Only by command of the clan 's next leader : Gaashah 's son . The boy ? ! A leader ? Where 's his weapon ? Where 's the fire in his eyes ? ! He 's as much an outsider as those who murdered his father . Who broke the peace ? What clan attacked ? Not a clan . An outsider . She escaped us . Find her . Kill her . And if she acted on anyone 's behalf we 'll catch her ... and torture her ... until she tells us . Damn , how come I didn 't think of that before ? The way the clans tortured the others ? - Others ? - What others ? Two clan leaders were killed . Before we arrived ? And you dren-heads are trying to blame it on us ? Look , just let me go , I 'll ... I 'll bring her back . You make a lot of noise ... for an outsider . I will go . I have a right to avenge my father ... to see his killer brought to justice . That is the law . And ... will you need your nanny ? My father is dead . You just insulted the leader of his clan . I will go . And I will take him with me . He will lead me to her . We have another duty first ... the burial sacraments . Maybe Gaashah wasn 't even the target ... maybe she was aiming at something else and he wandered into the line of fire . Your talking about my father . His blood is still wet on the ground , thanks to your friend 's vicious hand . It 's my mistake . I was just thinking out loud , trying to figure out why . Why ? Why an outsider would come all this way to kill my father . A good man . And my father was ... a good man . Are you going to kill him here ? What ? Did you come to question my resolve ? Because I will avenge my father . I can handle this myself . By putting a gun to the head of the only person who can help us find Aeryn ? I am the leader of my tribe now . Which makes you what ? Just like all the rest ? Maybe we should keep moving ... before Aeryn takes out another clan leader . I think that maybe we should split up . So you can run ? Son , at this point you either trust me or you don 't . Right . Sikozu and I will take the trail up the ridge . You continue along the bank . We 'll cross down to you further along . Oh , you take the high road ... and I 'll take the low road and I 'll be in Scotland before you ... Behind you . Did I kill Gaashah ? Yeah . Why ? I have no idea . That 's all I remember ... thinking : 'I can 't stop myself . ' What about the others ? What others ? D 'Argo , for one . What ? He 'll be all right . There were no others . It was just Gaashah . One clean shot . How much chakkan oil for one clean shot ? How many ? How many people did I kill ? Seventeen . You better slow down , crusty . People kill each other on this planet all the time . Finding a way to kill Gaashah was ... finding a way to start a war . She has no reason to start a war . I know ... I suspect you 're being used . By who ? I need evidence . Until now , nothing presented itself . The other ... assassins were both killed instantly . She 's ... the only one left alive long enough to speak . But I was completely out of control . I don 't remember anything . Then ... we must see to it that you do . I aimed ... and I shot him ... - And ? - And that 's all I see . We 're not getting anywhere . Try again . I 'm trying . It 's all I see ... it 's all I remember . Then don 't see ... listen . There was a child ... is he ... ? Still alive . I hit the child . Why did I hit the child ? No ... that wasn 't real . I never really hit him . I never actually hit the child . Who cares ? A bug ... A-A ... a bug ... bit me , and I ... A bug ... A bug bit me . There are no bugs on this planet . I killed them . I killed those people . I ki ... I killed them all . Bug bites . Flashes . I killed them all . I 'm gonna leave now . - Before there 's another killing . - What ? Me ? I 'm the next assassin . Okay ... heap-big smoke , no bugs , no flashes . Can we breathe now ? Are you sure you 're both stabilized ? - Yes ! - Yes . Then you may need this . Winona . How the hell did you get her ? Peacefully . For the most part . Uh ... we need to go ... quickly . Nobody 's going anywhere ! Please ! Reach for it . Or shall I gun you down the way you did my father ? He never so much as drew his blade ! - She 's not responsible for Gaashah 's death . - A dozen clansmen saw her ! - She was being controlled . - Lies ! She got bit by an insect , which allowed her to be controlled . - We do not have insects on this planet . - No ? Well then , what do you call that ? Or those ? - Why ? Who brought them here ? - Enemies of peace . People who want power . More power . This is not possible ! It 's not possible . Who did your father trust , Zerbat ? Paroos . He ... always trusted Paroos . And do you trust your father 's judgment ? And yours . Then we have work to do . Hey , kids . We may be forgetting something . Don 't we need to bug-ball ... a hive ? The insects are off-world . I didn 't bring them . You didn 't bring them . - So essentially we 're looking for ... ? - ... an off-worlder . Your sgabba flies failed ! They have no attraction to this particular alien species . Everybody likes me . It is not my fault the priest is still alive . These outsiders are difficult . You told me you could control them ! The sgabba flies implant subtle subliminal signals . My mental powers intensify those signals . Your impaired mental powers ! The clansmen 's hatred is easy to exploit . These ... outsiders have no reason to kill . It takes more sgabba ... more time . I 'm not paying you to make excuses . You 're here to incite anarchy ... War ! You are not paying me enough . I want ... double . Will that pay for the extra sgabba to eliminate the outsiders ? Of course . Make your bugs . Damn ! - You gonna be all right to do this ? - Yes ! Yes . Are you ? Of course you are . Move . Come on ! I command my clan . Respect me , or kill me . Go . Leave ! What 's going on ? Where 's Crichton ? Talk and move D 'Argo . It 's faster . They 're on their way up to the castle . Hurry ! Crichton ... ? - Anybody ? - Chiana . Where are you ? In Falaak 's palace . I 'm blind . We 're coming . The bugs are coming . The bugs are coming for you . You saw the hive ? The hive 's in E 'Alet 's head . Can you hear me ? Can you hear me ? What did you see ? What did you see ? Chiana ? - Is Cri ... is Crichton with you ? - Yeah , right here . Where 's the bad guy ? Haven 't seen him for a while . Haven 't seen anything . Too long ... this is not gonna go away . - It 's all right . We 'll get you out of here . - Soon . Soon as we find the beekeeper . Damn ! - What ? The bugs ? - Yeah , just ... stay down . Yeah , I-I can help . They-they don 't bite me . Just stay down ! Damn ! - You okay ? - No . - I think ... too many more of these , and I 'm ... - Yeah , I know what you mean . Good news is , where there 's bugs , there 's gotta be ... Oh , hell ! Stay down . What happened ? Who 's here ? He 's still alive . Shoot him , then . You shoot him . I can 't . Me either . Well then ... We have a problem . Fight it . I am . What the frell 's goin ' on ? Stay down ! Whatever you 're doin ' ... stop . Now ... I 'm not sure ... I have the strength to miss next time . I think ... I 'm just a bad shot . You know I really thought ... the coin toss ended badly . It did . - Chiana ! - Stop her , Chiana ! - Stop it ! Aeryn , stop it ! - I can 't ! You can fight against it . D 'Argo , just knock me out . Knock me out ! Hit me harder , you big sissy ! They 're getting stronger ! Priest ! Stop him ! It 's gone . Excellent ! You have extinguished this ... threat to our peace . I declare a feast to celebrate . You ... lie ! I heard everything . You , you hired E 'Alet . And will the clans believe a banished outsider , hmm ? You ordered my father 's death so ... there 'd be war . Welcome home , boy . Zerbat , think of your father . Is this what he wanted ? You know what your treachery means to your clan . The others would wipe them out man , woman and child . You can prevent that . You can die the noble hero . I 'll make it as painless as possible . Or you can surrender ! And according to the law - our laws - go before the other clans . And I 'll make sure ... they 'll try as hard as possible not to tear your body apart . I can go either way . The old ... or the new ? You decide . I 'll not be judged by you or your pitiful council . Is that your father I hear , screaming for mercy ... ? ! You made your father proud . Making the destruction of your castle your first order as Prefect was extremely bold . A leader belongs " with " his people , not above them . Sounds like your father talking . You know ... I want you to stay . As an advisor ? Perhaps ... much more . I would love nothing more ... than to be off that Leviathan and away from those outsiders . My term as Prefect is only half a cycle . We could ... leave together as we planned . As " you " planned . I 'm starting to care about you . Good . But you 're right , a leader belongs with his people . Seriously , that 's the longest this blindness has ever lasted . Then stop using the vision , twizzet . I 'm sure you 'll be the first to miss me next palace coup . Should I 've let the bugs eat your hide ? I 'll take that as a blessing ... holy man . Moya and Pilot are waiting . We must leave . What , and leave all these stragrats behind ? I 'm sorry , I 'm just kidding ... I 'm just kidding . All right ...

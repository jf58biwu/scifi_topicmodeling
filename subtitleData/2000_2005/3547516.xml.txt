 What is it ? Mauser , what is it ? If I were you , Cleo , I 'd stand back . You know about Mauser and his inventions . I know you are nostalgic about your own time . And there is a certain childhood pet ... you speak of often . Mr. Pants . You didn 't ? Oh ! I call him Mr. Pants , Mark 2 . Wow , look at him . Well , there weren 't any real dogs left ... after the Underground Food Wars of 2347 , so Mauser had to improvise . I 've programmed him with the behavior ... of a domesticated canine . Really ? Oh . Sit . Oh . Speak . What shall I say ? And it talks , too , just like the original . Thank you , Mauser . How is your new training partner ? Okay . A hologram doesn 't really have ... the same reaction time as the real thing . Perhaps , but I 'm sure he doesn 't bruise ... as easily , either . Sarge . Sarge . Sarge . What is it , Voice ? Take the team to Landing 47 ... and run some shaft drills . Cleopatra needs more work on her landing technique . Voice , we 've been running drills for six weeks . When are you gonna give us a mission ? When I 'm satisfied the team can handle one . Shaft drills and gauntlet drills . You know what ? This bites . I am ready to kick butt now . Let 's face it , there is nothing that any bad guy ... can throw at us that we can 't handle . You got that right , Cleo . Distortion grenade ! Come on , come on . Mauser , activate the blast field ! Get it out of here ! Get it out ! Cleo . Lab defense is offline . Got it . What is it ? No ! Oh , Mr. Pants . Hey ! Hey ! No , no , no , no , no . You 're a bad boy . Now sit . Good . Just drop it . Everybody down ! Mauser , intruder protocol . Hold it right there ! Freeze ! I 'm gonna barf . Who are you ? I 'm your new team leader . Five hundred years into the future , she will enter a world where machines rule the Earth . Mankind has been driven underground . And Cleopatra is about to discover ... there 's no place like home . " In the year 2525 " " There are women with the will to survive " " Fighting for a brand new day " " Nothing is gonna get in their way " " And in the year 2525 " " Three women keep hope alive " Joining forces to reclaim the Earth Looking ahead to humankind 's rebirth 2x11 " THE SOLDIER WHO FELL FROM GRACE " Subtitles by subXpacio My name is Marcus . I will be taking command of this team , effective immediately . Voice , is this for real ? You will take your orders from Marcus now . It 's real . Sorry , Voice . I don 't answer to anyone but Hel . Same goes for me . Strayton here would be very happy to take your place . Nobody 's quitting this team . But I would like to know why Voice suddenly feels ... we need a babysitter . For starters , you 've had to auto-destruct more labs ... than any other team ... in the history of the Resistance . We like to move around . A two-man squad was able to neutralize ... your defenses in under two minutes . This was hardly a fair test of our defenses . You threw a distortion grenade at us . In the past , you have defied Voice 's direct orders ... thus endangered critical Resistance operations ... and very nearly exposing Voice herself . Any more questions ? One . You mind turning him back on ? Did I miss something ? In all my years as a team leader ... Who is he ? ... I 've never seen such inadequate security . When he said his name , you and Sarge acted like you knew him . I know of him . Marcus is the original team leader . The first one Voice recruited when the Resistance began . He 's a legend , literally . I didn 't even know he was still alive . Well , old school . Hmm . I 'm not here to sign autographs . Voice tells me you 've been itching for a mission . Well , you 're gonna get one , one that could effect the entire course ... of the Resistance . Voice thinks you 're the best team for the job . I don 't . But , again , I don 't second-guess my orders . Your power levels are 20 % below normal . Is there a problem with your quaduranium reactor ? No . I 'm simply running the reactors ... at reduced power . Why ? Well , because - I 'll take a look for myself . I better take him out or he 's just gonna make a big oily mess . What do we have here ? Oh . I - I was just using it to dry my things ... because if it 's on full power it just burns them all up . What are you doing here ? I 'm-I 'm sorry - Oh , you 're sorry you 're jeopardizing a cause ... that hundreds of people have given their lives for . If this is what you 've given me to work with , Voice ... Marcus . I said I was sorry . And you 're sorry that you could get your teammates killed ... because your lab defenses weren 't at full power . Well , at least you 'll have nice dry clothes to wear to their funerals . At least one good thing 's come of this . I get you out of my head , Voice . Sarge , you 're hurting my feelings . I 'm sure . Would you take it easy , Strayton ? It takes a strong person to accept the Voice , maybe one in a thousand . Don 't be ashamed you couldn 't handle it . Ashamed ? I said , " Take it easy . " I 've been taking it easy on you since I got here . You 're a real tough guy when you 're hiding ... behind a distortion grenade , aren 't you ? Mauser 's gonna want this . Voice . Play fetch . Sure . You okay ? Yeah . I just didn 't expect that whole drill sergeant : " Only two things come from Texas " routine . Marcus doesn 't know you the way we do . He knows that I 'm just a girl from the 20th century playing soldier . I can 't even do a real pushup . How am I supposed to help save the world ? Cleo , look at me . If I thought you were gonna get in my way or hurt the team , I would have stuck you back in that freezer ages ago . That 's sweet . Now if you two are done crying on each other 's shoulders , there 's a mission briefing in 20 minutes . Just so you know , I agree with what you said . You get in my way or endanger my mission , I 'll take you out . Do you hear me ? Oh , fetch . Oh , Mr. Pants ! Oh , Mr. Pants , you gave me such a fright . That 's quite an antique you have there . Yeah , had it for a long time . More of a good luck charm than anything . You think I was too hard on Cleopatra . We may not always do things by the book down here , Marcus , but we do get the job done . So Voice told you that we compromised her security , huh ? Mmm-hmm . Well , Voice , did you also tell him ... about all the times we kept you secure ? Mmm ? Did you mention that we risked our lives ... for the Bailey technology that 's in his gauntlet ? Or that this team destroyed a Betrayer factory ? And we couldn 't have done any of that without Cleopatra . She was even the first to pilot Mauser 's Shaft Racer . Did Voice tell you any of this ? She told me . But this is a war , not a pajama party . Those are your troops out there . Don 't treat them like your friends . They are my friends . And it 's looking like they 're the only thing ... I can count on in this war . I wanted more time ... to prepare you for this mission . But Voice feels we need to move quickly . Well , we 'll just try to keep up then . For security purposes , however , Voice requests that I restrict this briefing ... to mission-critical personnel . I thought we straightened this out . Cleopatra is an absolutely critical member of this team . Hel , it 's okay . I 'm not talkin about Cleopatra . I 'm talking about you , Hel . What ? Since you 've compromised Voice to Creegan ... and to the Bailies , I must consider you a security risk . Now , if you 'll excuse us . This is crazy . No . No , Sarge , don 't . Of course , Marcus . I understand . I 'll leave you to it . Hel ? Living legend or not , that guy 's completely out of control . Sarge , get back to the briefing . Hel , I didn 't join this fight ... for some noble ideal of Voice 's ... or to follow around some crazy soldier like Marcus . I joined to fight with you . And if you 're not part of this team , then I got no interest in being on it . Fine . So what are you gonna do , Sarge ? Go back to your old life ? Now , there 's a plan . I 'm sure you could still turn a few credits ... scamming defenseless levels for protection money . I 'm sorry . I just don 't want you to give up everything because of me . Stay with the team . Without you , there isn 't a team . Sarge , don 't make this any harder . Harder for who ? You 're the one standing there with your bag packed . What am I supposed to do here ? What you do best . Keep fighting . And keep an eye on Cleo . Where are you going ? I don 't know . Goodbye . We 're calling this mission Operation Hellfire . Ass . Since your team 's discovery of the shaft defense cannons , we 've been trying to find a way to harness them for our own use . We 've been unsuccessful . Since these cannons are the only weapon we 've seen ... that can bring down a Bailey , it is imperative that we learn their secrets . Phase one of the operation is to gain access ... to the cannons internal mechanism , which can only be done ... with the cannons in the firing position . You said , " Phase One . " What 's Phase Two ? Phase Two is to move the cannons aboveground ... and establish a beachhead on the surface . We 're finally gonna take the fight to the Bailies . I miss you , Daddy . I 've shot my share of looters . Take it easy . I 'm not a looter . Helen ? Do I know you ? It 's me , Venitz . Bester Venitz . Bester ? Bester , what 's happened here ? Where is everybody ? You 've been gone a long time , Helen . Shaft gangs moved through here seven years ago . Drove most everybody out . Bester , my aunt and uncle , have you seen them ? Are they okay ? Some folks moved down shaft , found work . You could try there . Most folks just moved out . Okay . Thank you . Cleo , you okay ? Sure . All for one and one for all , right ? You know Hel 's still a part of this team , even though she 's not here . Everyone I 've ever known ... has been dead for half the millennium . When I was unfrozen , I would 've just become spare body parts ... and no one would have even known ... or cared ... if it hadn 't been for Hel . Well , when I first came underground , the only people I knew were trying to ... either buy me , sell me , or kill me , or worse , till I met Hel . If Hel hadn 't altered my Betrayer programming , I rather doubt we would have become friends . How are we gonna keep going without her ? Just imagine how mad she 's gonna be if we don 't . Hey , I 'm looking for some people . A man and a woman named Carter . They may have come down from Level 2922 . I 'll be damned . Kilgannon . Hel . What brings you down this way ? Undercover or something ? Hey , Voice , you send Hel down here to check up on me ? I 'm retired . What a coincidence ... so am I. To Voice and all the good fighters she 's sent to their graves ... in the name of her futile , bloody cause . Yeah , well , so much for good times , huh ? There 's more of us , Hel , former team members . A few leaders even , like us . We decided to listen to our own voices ... instead of that coward in our heads ... jerking us around like puppets , deciding our fate . Well , good for you . You ought to join us . We 're putting together a mission of our own . A little search and destroy op to stop Voice doing to anyone else what she did to us . Thanks , uh , but I 'm looking for some people . Oh , well , think about it . Those are full-power blasters , Cleo , so be careful . Why do I need full-power blasters ? I thought I was just gonna run the scanning equipment . We 've run multi-plane scans of the cannon control room , so we know the general layout of the place . But we don 't know what security we 'll run into . I need you to help me out , Cleopatra . I thought that was Strayton 's job . You want your teammates to take all the risks ... while you hang back ? Is that what Hel let you do ? No , it isn 't . But Cleo 's specialty isn 't combat . She 's not used to those gauntlets . It 's about time she learned . Just take your time , okay ? Stay cool . Pick your targets ... just like Hel and I taught you . You 'll be fine . Okay . Let 's do it . Start scanning . Find the manual override to the cannons . Keep scanning . Oh , look out ! Mauser , freeze simulation . Why don 't we just have you stick with scanning ? I 'm surprised Cleopatra hasn 't gotten you killed , can 't even fire a gauntlet . Not the person I 'd want watching my back . I guess I shouldn 't be surprised , considering the way Hel ran this team . I 've been listening to you talk trash ... about my friends since you got here . Sounds to me like you 're intimidated ... by a team of women . What 's wrong ? Aren 't you man enough ? Think you 're up to proving yourself in the white room ? Bring it on . Was that a team member I saw you talking to ? Didn 't get his name . Trying to bring you back into the fold ? Don 't do it . Don 't worry . Hey , you don 't owe her anything , Hel . You think about all the people ... Voice has gotten killed protecting herself . Dev , Carla , Jace , Strayton . Did you say Strayton ? Tell me about Strayton . He 's dead . What more do you wanna know ? Are you sure ? Yes , I 'm sure . Any rules , or do you just want to - Figured you deserved at least as much warning ... as I got for that grenade . Don 't be ashamed if you can 't handle it . Still want me to take it easy ? I thought you were . Enough . I said that 's enough . You two want to kill each other , do it after the mission . He was on my team . We were on the surface setting data sensors . Two bailies got the jump on us . Strayton covered me as I fell back , but they caught him in their tractor beams , tore him to pieces . Hel , I saw Strayton die myself . Did Voice know ? Who cares ? I doubt it . I cashed it in that day . Cut out my Voice receptor on the spot and headed down here . Never made a report , never spoke to Voice again . Radiation from the cannons ... could interfere with communication , so stay sharp . We 'll abort if anything seems wrong . Yeah , well , something already seems wrong . Stay tight . Stay focused . Okay ? Voice says , " Good luck . " Okay , you stay and be a good boy , all right ? But it 's time for walkies . Not now , later . We 're in position . I read , you 're in position . Voice , we 're right by the guns . You ready ? Enable . Now . That 's it . Let 's move . I said , let 's move . They 're in . Keep those guns moving , Strayton . Wow . So this was built by the people that made the shafts . Be awestruck later . Start scanning . We need to interface with the main control system . Mauser . Hel ? Hel , the mission is under way . You 're not authorized to be here . Mauser , I think Strayton 's a Betrayer . You have to warn Sarge . Voice wants to know where you obtained this information . It doesn 't matter . You have to abort now . Interference from the cannon fire ... has cut off the com signal . The team are on their own . What ? What 's taking them so long ? Any luck ? No , my interference sensors ... can 't lock any command signals . Maybe it 's encrypted , or maybe the system language is too old . I don 't know . I 'm a stripper , not a scientist . You have a question on the operation ... of the automated shaft cannon defense system . How may I assist you ? Hey , a-a-an owner 's manual . How do I take over manual control of the system ? I 'm sorry , for your safety and security , the system is designed to be fully automatic . The controls cannot be overridden . Can Voice contact Marcus ? The interference has cut off ... Voice 's communication with the team as well . I know they 're in trouble . I have to get out there . Voice believes the mission is proceeding as planned . Well , she can 't talk to them , can she ? How does she know ? Voice 's orders . Mauser , I know something 's wrong . Are you gonna just stand there and follow orders or are you gonna help our friends ? He says we can 't override the commands , so let 's get out of here . Keep scanning . That doesn 't sound good . Why 'd you turn off that hologram , Strayton ? 'Cause I can 't allow the shaft cannon technology ... to fall into the hands of a Voice team . Whose hands would you rather it fall into ? I knew you healed too fast . Let 's get out of here . Move ! Stand back . All personnel must exit the control area ... before the portals are sealed . Why ? The cannon recharging cycle will flood the area ... with high-energy radiation that is incompatible with human life . Oh , my . The cannon recharging cycle will begin in 60 seconds . Shields up . Standard personal shields ... will not provide sufficient protection . This area must be evacuated within 55 seconds . Oh , there 's gotta be another way out of here . The recharging cycle doubles as a security system ... to deal with intruders such as yourselves . The radiation will only be avoided ... when the cannons are activated . 50 seconds . Okay , Mr. Living Legend , what now ? Strayton , Sarge , come in . What 's your status ? 40 seconds . There 's gotta be a way to shut down the system . An emergency override . Of course . Great . Override . Please provide override security code . Thanks . Strayton , come in . What the hell 's going on ? Sarge , need you to get that hologram back up . Please evacuate the area in 20 seconds . Voice , I 'm aborting the mission . Strayton , get these gun doors open ... in the next 20 seconds or we 're dead . Marcus , we got a problem . No kidding . Your friend Strayton went a little Betrayer on me , put a hole right through the holo-projector . It 's fried . 25 seconds . Mauser , I need you to uplink all the Bailey telemetry ... we have in the computers into the Shaft Racer . Now ! Hel , what are you doing ? I 'm gonna transfer the signal to make those cannons think ... I 'm the biggest baddest Bailey they 've ever seen . Loading the signal now , Hel . Begin broadcasting the Bailey signature . Five seconds . Four ... Mauser , boost the signal ! ... two , one . Come on . Mauser , I 'm not getting any acceleration . I had to sacrifice some performance ... when I switched the fuel to regular quaduranium . Now he tells me . Are Cleo and Marcus clear ? Cleopatra , hurry it up ! Oh ! Hel , we 're clear . I 'm shutting down the signal . I 'm hit ! Hel , bail out ! The canopy 's jammed . Hel , get out of there . Robots . Tell me about it . Good morning , team . Hey . Who is this ? A question . I 'm happy to answer all questions ... on the automated shaft cannon defense system . How did you ... I downloaded most of him into my gauntlet ... before Marcus dragged me out of the control room . Most of his data is highly encrypted , took me all night just to get him to materialize . Where is Marcus , anyway ? I woke up this morning , he was already gone . I think he was too embarrassed ... to show his face when he found out ... his second-in-command was a Betrayer . Hel , Marcus ' mission is complete . Voice ? Marcus has informed me ... that your team performed admirably . I 'd like to resume regular missions ... as soon as possible . Anything you say , Voice . Anything you say . Oh . Mr. Pants .

 Control , lights . So , does Mr. Control mix drinks , too ? Oh , sorry , I have to do that by hand . Why don 't you make yourself more comfortable ? I think I can do that . What ? You . Look at you , Krider . This place . What about it ? Nothing . No . It 's great . It 's a far cry from - From what we used to be ? Yeah . You 're not the only one to get out of the Black Watch . Well , I thought I was , until now . But I 'm not surprised it was you . To our new lives . I never thought I 'd see you again Sarge . I 'm glad the name stuck . Well , you gave it to me . I only told you what it stood for . Remind me . Sensual , arousing , raw , gorgeous , erotic . That spells " Sarge , " doesn 't it ? Yeah . I 'm Kavilo , Marla 's aide . Do you have the information , Mr. DeGaillen ? I only talk to Marla . Well , Marla 's a little busy ruling this part of the Underworld , so you 'll talk to Marla when I decide you 're worth her time . The Watch made me . So you better decide pretty quick . What was that ? It 's the Watch . Secure our guest . Yes , sir . We 've got to get him out of here . Stay down ! Please . Please , I 'm not armed . Take them to the morgue for analysis . Marla ? Thanks for coming , Hel . Come out , come out , wherever you are . Sarge . Marla , what happened ? This was Dylan , a member of the Watch who we 'd enlisted as our spy . He was about to provide us with some very valuable information . A double agent , eh ? Now he 's double-oh-dead . We think that the Watch is developing a new project . We persuaded Dylan here to get his hands on it , although now we may never know if he succeeded . Hel , we must know what the Watch is up to . You can count on our help . Marla , the chip , it hasn 't been tampered with . The entire event was recorded . Hey , Sarge , that looks like you . Freeze it . Marla , this is ridiculous . Hel , that 's not me . Five hundred years into the future , she will enter a world where machines rule the earth . Mankind has been driven underground . And Cleopatra is about to discover ... there 's no place like home . " In the year 2525 " " There are women with the will to survive " " Fighting for a brand new day " " Nothing is gonna get in their way " " And in the year 2525 " " Three women keep hope alive " " Joining forces to reclaim the Earth " " Looking ahead to humankind 's rebirth " 2x12 " NO THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES " Subtitles by subXpacio I 'm telling you , Marla , that is not me . I 've never even seen this guy before . Somebody must 've screwed with that chip . Hel , you know I didn 't do this . Marla , anyone could 've doctored that chip . It 's been in my possession the entire time . Well , F.Y.I. , Sarge has an airtight alibi . Let me guess : She was with you two at the time . I was with a friend . That is still legal , isn 't it ? And I 'm sure your " friend " can explain the surveillance hologram . I 'm afraid , Sarge , that you 're under arrest . You are not arresting me . Hel , we 've agreed to adhere to Marla 's rule of law ... while in her jurisdiction ... Voice , wait . ... but only if we deem it to be a just one . I think Sarge deserves the benefit of the doubt . Voice , insist this be a fair investigation . There 's nothing more to investigate . You know the penalty for murder . So you 're just gonna execute her ? No defense , no trial ? She has no defense ! As for her trial , it shouldn 't take long . That 's mighty efficient of you , lady . An efficient system of justice is the most effective one . No one leaves the Watch , Sarge . We 'll hunt you down for eternity if we have to . Marla , there 's no efficiency in executing an innocent person . Please , I 'm not armed . All we need is a little time . Turn her over , and our partnership remains a healthy one . What does that mean , exactly ? It means that if you and Voice ... no longer share my goal for restoring law and order to the Underworld , I 'll have no choice but to consider you an enemy of the people that I protect . Hel , if this is Marla 's attitude , we must get Sarge out of there . Voice doesn 't like what she 's hearing . If your team doesn 't stand down , Voice , I 'll consider them accomplices after the fact and arrest them , too . Hel , Marla 's sense ofjustice seems a bit extreme , don 't you think ? Absolutely . Marla , you need to think about this . Guards , arrest her now . Yes , Marla . Cleo , Sarge , stun ! Oh , Mighty Mouse ! Sarge , let 's go ! Hurry , you guys ! Come on , Sarge ! Voice , it looks like Marla 's serious . There 's a hidden level just ahead , Hel . I 'm transmitting a frequency key through your gauntlet . Pull up ! Thanks , Voice . I 'm impressed . Well , we need to buy some time to prove Sarge 's innocence . You two , over there . Sensors indicate they landed on this level . Are you three all right ? For now . Well , I think it goes without saying ... that Marla 's justice is getting a touch too swift . However , we must still resolve this . Agreed . Alpha Squad , head down shaft . Move it ! Sarge . Hel , I didn 't do it . We know . Just tell us where you were last night , Sarge . I was with Krider . Oh . Hel , he 's out of the Watch . Has been for a long time . Okay . So he 'll vouch for your whereabouts , then . Case closed , right ? Right ? Please , I 'm not armed . Sarge ? Sarge ? You okay ? Let 's just get to Krider 's . Control , exit . Sarge ! Krider , let us in . Yeah , sure , come on in , Sarge . What 's goin ' on ? Marla and her goons think I killed some Black Watch turncoat I never even knew . Some guy named Dylan . I need for you to tell Marla I was here with you last night . Krider ? Krider , I was here with you last night . You were here , but ... But what ? You must remember . Remember what ? Krider , I - Sarge , you told me all about Dylan , that you knew him , and that you had some unfinished business with him . Sarge , is this true ? Sarge ? Sarge ? Go ! Proximity alarm . I 'm reading multiple signatures approaching . Marla . Marla ? Sarge , what did you do ? Hel , you and your team are outgunned and outnumbered . You have 20 seconds to surrender . Surrender , my ass . Intel probe . Take it out . I count 22 . Standard infiltration spread . Give me that . Deactivate the lock . Sarge . Voice , tell me there 's another way off this level . I 'm sorry , Hel . There 's not . No back door . We 're gonna have to do this the hard way . They 're moving in . Everybody take cover . Hel , listen to me . I 'll listen once we 're outta here . Got it ! Sarge , fall back now ! Freeze ! Nobody move ! Get down , Sarge ! Sarge , get down ! Sarge ! Cease fire . Enough ! Nobody move . Weapons down . Sarge . Stand down , Hel . This is how it 's got to be . Wise move , Sarge . Sarge . Hel , I 've done enough damage . It 's high time I took responsibility for my actions . What actions ? You didn 't - I did . I killed Dylan . What are you doing ? Confessing . Sarge , don 't confess to a crime you didn 't commit ... just to get us out of this . I 'm confessing because it 's the truth , Cleo . I 'm not going to let the two of you go down ... for a personal score that I had to settle . " Personal score " ? What the hell are you talking about ? Dylan had to die , Hel . Let 's get this over with . Just leave my friends out of it . I 'm satisfied with just having you . Come on . Marla , I heard you have a mnemonic extractor . Hel , she 's confessed . Her mind may have been tampered with , her memories . You 're reaching , Hel . Scan her memories . If they match the crime , then I ... We won 't cause you any more trouble . Check your weapons . Hel , you know Sarge and I go way back . If there 's anything I can do to help ... Come on , Cleo . Hel , this is only going to show you what I already know . Make sure her head is secure . Hel , what is that thing ? It 's a mnemonic extractor . It coverts memory into holographic images . A high-tech lie detector , huh ? We 're ready . Let 's begin with the hours leading up to the crime . Just focus on those memories , Sarge . To our new lives . I never thought I 'd see you again , Sarge . I 'm glad the name stuck . Well , you gave it to me . I only told you what it stood for . Remind me . Sensual , arousing , raw , gorgeous , erotic . That spells " Sarge , " doesn 't it ? Yeah . Wait . Someone else left the Watch , you know . Oh , really ? Who ? Dylan DeGaillen . Never heard of him . He hunted me for years after I left the Watch . But tonight , I 'm gonna hunt him . Sarge , don 't do this . I have to . Please , I 'm not armed . Are you satisfied ? Sarge , are you okay ? The extractor was fighting her . That means she may have been trying to keep a memory from coming out . Was revenge your only motive , Sarge ? What are you getting at ? What I 'm getting at is that killing Dylan kept their secrets a secret . You are a former member of the Watch . I have no loyalty to those scumbags . What about this old flame of yours , Krider ? You saw it . He had nothing to do with this . Are you still working for the Watch , Sarge ? No ! That 's enough , Marla . You 're right . That is enough . Take her to the holding cell and prep the cryo chamber . We 'll freeze her until sentencing . Come on , let 's go . I suggest you say your goodbyes . Get in there . This isn 't over , Sarge . I 'm so sorry , you guys . So that 's it ? I don 't understand . You both saw it . I guess I never really did change . It 's not easy for me to admit . I 'm the same killer I ever was . I don 't believe that . Neither do I. When you saw that holo-recording , you were just as surprised as we were . I guess I blocked it out . What about this Dylan guy ? Hel , I hated him . Sarge ! He 's been out there all this time , hunting you down , a constant threat to your life , and you never bothered to mention him to us once ? I guess I blocked him out , too . I don 't think so . Hel , this sounds like a classic memory repression to me . You 've seen this before ? Yeah , I was a psych minor . Sometimes when people go through traumatic experiences or they do something they really regret , their mind just blocks it all out . So Sarge may have more of these blocks and not know it ? Maybe . You know , we could use hypnosis to find out . Hip ... what ? It 's a low-tech way of unbinding memories . I got a B + in hypnotherapy . Hel , what do you have to lose ? Let Cleo try . If there 's a way of uncovering more of the story , we should do it . Will this work on Sarge ? Not if she 's frozen . Voice ? Any new memories ... before we commit you to cryo-freeze ? Take her . Guards , fire ! Thanks , Mauser . Congratulations , Hel . You and Voice have just started a war . That 's it , Voice . Lab defense systems all powered up , outer shields at full capacity . Good , Hel , because Marla 's force have orders ... to bring you and your team in , dead or alive . Cleo , we 're running short on time . Relaxation , my friends . Calm . Deep , cleansing breath . Cleo , what the hell is this ? Do it now , please , Sarge . Good . Now with your eyes closed . Good . Mauser , lights please . In and out . Good . Now , imagine yourself floating ... on a sheet of cool air , high above the surface . You 're existing only in this moment . Now I 'm gonna count down from five to one . When I reach one , you 'll be asleep . Five , four , three ... You 're very tired . ... two , one . You 're sleeping now , Sarge . Tell me yourself . I 'm sleeping . I think she 's under . Okay , now we 're gonna go back to last night , Sarge . Hmm . Let 's . Where are you , Sarge ? I 'm seeing Krider again . How does that make you feel ? All fired up and ready for some good lovin ' . Okay . Well , tell us about it . He 's spelling my name . That spells " Sarge , " doesn 't it ? Oh , yeah . And then what happened ? I want him to kiss me , but he won 't . What is he doing , Sarge ? He 's telling me about some guy named Dylan . Someone else left the Watch , you know . Really ? Great . Now kiss me . Okay , fine , tell me who . His name is Dylan DeGaillen . That 's something new . This is a different memory , Hel . Krider brought up Dylan , not Sarge . Keep going . Ask her if she knew him . Sarge , you knew Dylan from before ? No . I 'd never heard of him before . Never heard of him . Who is he ? He 's me . Sarge , easy , calm . It 's okay . No , it 's not okay . I saw him . He 's alive . Sarge , how is it possible that Dylan was there ? He was meant to be at the safe house with Marla . Hel , Sarge woke up too easy . I don 't know if it worked . No , Cleo , it did work . He 's alive . I remember now . Well , there 's one way to find out . Freeze ! They 're here . They 're at the morgue . Mauser , tell me that was enough to get a voiceprint . Yes , it was , Hel . Standing by . Morgue level , say again ? Go , Mauser . Morgue level secure . False alarm . My apologies . Affirmative . Morgue level secure . It worked . Maybe , but let 's make this quick . Voice , we made it to the morgue . Hurry , Hel . I 'm reading increased activity near your position . Let 's make this quick , you guys . Here he is . Tell Sarge . It can 't be . I saw him . It checks out , Sarge . His wounds are showing particle traces ... of gauntlet laser fire . It 's Dylan . What is that ? Hel , you have to leave now . Not yet . Mauser , I 'm sending you a bio-scan . I need you to run a chronometric analysis . What the hell is happening ? Hel , I 'm detecting high levels of rapid cellular decay . Whoever you 're scanning was only a few hours old when he died . I 'll be damned . How could that be ? His cells where in a state of rapid decay ... even before his own death . So he wouldn 't have lived much longer anyway . That 's a relief . So , Dylan must be some kind of weird mutant , or - Or he 's a clone . And the real Dylan is still alive . Why would he have sent a clone to meet with Marla , only to be killed by me ? I don 't know where you fit into all this , Sarge , but staging Dylan 's death would keep any knowledge ... of the Watch 's project a secret . Hel , you must get out of there . We 're moving . Wait . So where 's the real Dylan ? I got a good idea where to start lookin ' . Stop right there ! There they are ! Don 't look back ! No ! No ! No ! Control , lights . Anything in here triggering a memory ? Something about that wall ... What is it , Sarge ? Sarge . Sarge . Cleo , what 's happening ? Something she saw must have triggered the hypnosis . Maybe she never came out of it all the way . I thought you said you were a major psycho . Psych minor . Big difference . Sarge , can you hear me ? Yes . Tell us what 's happening . I 'm going into another room . There 's a room behind the side wall . It 's holographic . Did she see how they tripped it ? Sarge , do you know how they activate the wall ? No . No . There 's got to be a manual release around here . What 's happening now , Sarge ? They 're tying me down . Oh my God . Hel , she was cloned . Hel , aim your gauntlet at the wall . I 'll try transmitting a generic frequency key . Keep her talking , Cleo . Just in case this doesn 't work . Tell me everything you can remember , Sarge . Dylan . He hunted me , but I killed him . I killed him . Sarge , what 's wrong ? I 'm awake now , Cleo . My God . You 're the clone . What ? Hel . Sarge ? Sarge . The Watch 's secret project , Sarge . We call it " flash cloning . " Pretty catchy , huh ? Duplicates you and all your memories in a flash . And its first use will be to frame you for my murder . Hurry up . What 's he doing to her ? Flash cloning allows us to manipulate memories . I 'm giving her the memory that Dylan has tried to kill her for years . She 's gonna wake up wanting nothing more ... than to see him dead . Your clone will be nothing more ... than what I want her to be : my assassin . Your clone 's assassin . Well , I don 't want to die , Sarge , but I need Marla to think I 'm dead . I die , everything I knew about the project dies with me . She 's looking for another mole . The Watch keeps her secret . She 's waking up , but ... But what ? She needs more time for the new memories to stabilize . No time . Just do it . To our new lives . Voice , get me some more of those frequency keys . Now ! Good night , my sweet . Control , exit . The memories took . She 's on her way . How does it feel to have the final hours ... of your life lived by someone else ? Why don 't you cut me loose and I 'll tell you . No , no . Your DNA is far too precious for that . We 've only just begun with you . Night-night , now . Boost it again ! They 're breaking through ! Boost it again , Voice . Hel ! Sarge ! Sarge ! I trusted you , Krider . Guess I was the only one to leave the Watch . You 'll pay for that sooner or later . Try never . Yeah ! Oh , look out , Sarge ! Hel ! Yeah ! Dylan . Hello again . Get up . I take it I 'm still programmed into that thing ? Marla . I think this is what you 're looking for . Thank you , Hel . I 'm glad that ... things worked out for you and your team . Sorry about the mix-up , Sarge . Looks like limited lifespan is a flaw in the technology . Did she know what she was ? I think she did , in the end . She 's a perfect copy . They wanted a killer . Looks like I gave them exactly what they wanted . No , Sarge . You only kill when you have to , for the team . What they wanted was a cold-blooded murderer . And that 's not who you are . Not anymore . Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries

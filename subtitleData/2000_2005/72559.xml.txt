 [ Fast-paced dramatic music ] DISPATCHER [ Over radio ] : DOC 3123 , come back . TOMMY : This is DOC 3123 . DISPATCHER : We have your weather update . Chance of flurries at higher elevations . Supposed to clear by midnight . Over . TOMMY : We 're in some weather here near Bellevue Pass . We 'll be running late . Over . dispatcher : Affirmative , 3123 . Will advise . Why didn 't we stay at Mt . Butte instead of trying to drive through this ? - Chance of flurries , my ass . - It 's not like we planned it this way . Besides , we got orders . Orders is orders . Trouble is , I think this mess is turning into a blizzard . - Yeah , meets all the criteria . - Criteria ? Yeah . To be a blizzard , certain very specific criteria have to be met . - Like what , lots of snow ? - Yeah . Plus you got to have winds of over 45 miles per hour ... temperature below 10 degrees , and visibility has to be below 500 feet . - How do you know this ? - Weather Channel . I still don 't see why getting some dirt bag to Death Row Randolph 's so important . RED : It 's not important . It 's only orders . RED : You want some ? TOMMY : No , thank you , sir . Told you before to call me Red . You know , maybe I will take a cup . Pal ! Look out ! [ Officers groan ] - You okay ? - Yeah . - Sorry , I think I hit- - - As long as no one 's hurt . RED : You okay back there ? JACK : Yeah , just great . [ Car engine turns over ] Attention , State Police , this is State Vehicle 3123 ... Department of Corrections . Come in . Over . This is State Vehicle 3123 . Come in . Over . Attention , State Police . Do you read me ? Over . Come on , come on . I repeat , do you read me ? Over . TOMMY : Nothing . - It 's weird . - So what 're we going to do ? We can 't stay here , not in this weather . TOMMY : All right , convict , we 're going on a little nature hike . I get any funny business , I 'm going to put one through your skull . Tommy , please . Things are hard enough , don 't you think ? [ Children laughing ] HANNAH : Got you . STEPHEN : Did not . STEPHEN : Did not . Did not . HANNAH : Did , too . Did , too . gloria : Hey , Garrett . gloria : Busy night . GARRETT : Where 'd they all come from ? gloria : Got me . DEL : Hey , Garrett . Coffee ? GARRETT : Please . - Del , did you plough the strip ? - Twice . Once this morning and again at around 4 : 00 . I even put salt down the second time . It 's still looking pretty crazy out there . It 's really coming down . Will you be able to take off in this weather ? - Excuse me . You the pilot ? - I am . What can I do for you ? Get us out of here . We 're booked on the 10 : 15 out of O 'Hare ... but my wife decided to slip in a few extra runs , we missed the bus . It 's always my fault . I 'm not assigning blame . And it had nothing to do with you drinking all afternoon with that woman . I told you that she was a rep from Midwestern and nothing was going on . Nothing like last time ? Sir , ma 'am , excuse me . We 've filed a flight plan . Scheduled departure is still set for 45 minutes . But whether we take off or not depends on the storm . So we might be grounded ? We might not leave at all ? Yes , sir , there is a chance . That 's unacceptable . I have a business meeting in Seattle tomorrow . Excuse me . Do you know who I am ? I 'm David Higgins , in the Fortune 500 . It 's really not up to me , sir . It 's not up to you ? You 're the pilot , right ? - Yes , but the FAA- - - Then you make the final decision . Tell her . I 'm trying to tell her . If it 's a question of money- - The FAA has strict guidelines ... designed to protect the health and safety of all passengers and crew . They decide when we are able to take off and when we can 't . Kids . - Got you . - Did not . - Did , too . - Did not , did not . ANDREW : Kids ! Can 't you see we 're trying to have an adult conversation here ? Andrew . We 're on an indefinite hold because of the weather . We don 't know when we 'll be able to take off . Is that clear ? REVEREND : Ma 'am ? gloria : Yes ? If you 'd point me in the direction of the men 's room I 'd be obliged . GARRETT : It 's through those doors . REVEREND : Bless you . Will you take a look at this ? Sorry to bother you , ladies , but we have a situation . We were in the process of transporting this prisoner up north ... when our vehicle was disabled down the road . We 're going to need a place to hole up until our relief unit arrives . gloria : Here ? Him ? TOMMY : Afraid so . I 'm not sure we have any facility to handle prisoners , Officer . GARRETT : What exactly did he do ? TOMMY : He 's a murderer , ma 'am . I 'm not sure we should have a murderer here with the passengers . We can handle him , ma 'am . It 's what we do . I 'm afraid we have no choice in the matter . If I could just make a call ? gloria : The phone lines have been down for an hour now . - Do you have a CB , or a backup radio ? - Nothing 's working . This is ridiculous . Just point us at a back room , we 'll get out of your hair , and you get back to work . - Del . - Yeah , I can show them something . I got to take a leak . - Much obliged . - Yeah , we 're right back here , gentlemen . Try something , you won 't have to wait for the chair . I 'll fry your ass right here . You going to watch or hold ? [ Toilet flushes ] Check it out . TOMMY : Hello , Padre . It 's Reverend , Officer . I 'm a simple preacher . I didn 't know who that was back there . The men 's room is very much like a house of God in that , in its confines ... all men are welcome . That 's a good one , Reverend . REVEREND : And who is this ? RED : Prisoner . In the process of transfer , we hit some ice , skidded off the road . - A felon ? - He don 't play well with others , sir . I will say a prayer for his soul . Show some respect . All can be forgiven , if one acknowledges his wicked deeds . Afraid my list of wicked deeds is too long . - Shall I hear your confession ? - Say what ? RED : That won 't be necessary , Reverend . Saving souls is always necessary . Would you like to confess , my son ? - You 're not a priest . - No , sir . I 'm a humble preacher . Only priests hear confession . Who are you ? Now , son . Perhaps you should show us some lD , Reverend . REVEREND : Certainly , Officer . My mistake . [ Suspenseful instrumental music ] Where I come from , convict , hitting a holy man is a grave offence . Yeah ? Where is that ? Some place far , far away . - What the hell are you doing here ? - Taking over . - Why ? - Because we don 't like you . [ Gunshots ] - Were those gunshots ? - Of course they were . What do you think ? You , what 're you waiting for ? Get in there ! Do something . That crazy-ass con gets out here , he 's going to smoke us all . [ Fast-paced dramatic music plays ] [ Steam hisses from pipe ] [ Unearthly bubbling ] DEL : Drop it ! I said , drop it ! Don 't . No ! Please , don 't hurt him . He 's just doing his job . - Are we done ? - Yeah . - Hey ! - Don 't shoot me ! I 'm not a hero . I 'm not a hero . Get back down there . Everybody else , back to the seats . You , too . - Can we talk ? - No . STEPHEN : You cheated ! HANNAH : No , you got in front of me . STEPHEN : No ! HANNAH : You got a head start . JACK : Hey ! You , get those kids . We were just playing . SARAH : It 's okay , honey , I think he 's just tired or something . - Tell me something . - What ? What 's your name ? - Darian . - Darian . - What kind of name is that ? - It 's my name . - What , you don 't like my name , now ? - Tell me something , Darian ... who got off the call to the cops ? - Nobody . - Who called them ? - I ain 't seen nobody call nobody , man . - Are you lying to me ? I 'm lying , I 'm dying . I know the drill , dog . We tried . The landlines are out . Try yourself . Yeah , listen to the lady , man . Go on , try them . Cell phones don 't work here , either . [ No dial tone from phone ] You killed those men , didn 't you ? You don 't have to worry about who I killed last , only who I 'll kill next . Give me your cell phone . [ Cell phone beeping ] SGT . GRlFFlN : The bathroom , sir . JACK : What 's that ? If those men are still alive , it 'll go a long way in your favour if we tried to help them . Nobody who walked in there is ever coming out . [ Angie sobs ] angle : Son of a bitch . You animal . You . david : Me ? JACK : Yeah . What size shoes you wear ? david : Eleven . JACK : Take them off . Pardon ? - Sir , where 's your luggage ? - It 's right there . GARRETT : There . You want clothes ? There , you got clothes . You a fancy boy ? Lots of pretty clothes . I like to look nice . Is there a crime against that ? Not in this state . - What 's he doing ? - He 's just changing his clothes , okay ? " Let 's take a charter service . What could go wrong ? " The rules don 't apply to you . - Do you really think that this is the time ? - It 's never the time with you . Whenever I want to talk , something is in the way . " I have to work . I 'm busy . " You know what ? I have a life , too . You through ? Listen , I don 't know why we can 't just all get along here . You don 't have to kill people and rape us , man . Shut up . Nothing is happening to you . - What is it you want from us , sir ? - What I want , General ... is to get out of here and head to Canada . To do that I need a pilot . Who knows how to fly ? You 're it , little darling . Nobody here is going to hurt you . - Just take what you want and leave . - That 's what I 'm going to do . You 'll never get away with it . They 'll hunt you down like a dog . Oh , yeah ? I got news for you , pal . Once they see what 's in there , I 'll be the least of their worries . [ Breathing abnormally fast ] JACK : Somebody shut her up . GARRETT : She 's hyperventilating . [ Grunting and cries amid dramatic music ] STEPHEN : What happened ? SARAH : Come on . SARAH : No , please . You shot her . You bastard . You killed her . So stupid . Stupid and unnecessary . You want to be next ? - Please , mister , don 't hurt anybody else . - Yeah , we 'll do whatever you want . You . Get back there . You fight for a living . I fight to stay alive . Don 't make me hurt you , General . Come on . Don 't give him an excuse to hurt anybody else . [ Eerie music plays ] What ? She 's ... . Oh , my God . [ Angie growls ] Some shot . Would 've gone right through the heart ... if I had one . JACK : Don 't touch it . [ Unearthly bubbling ] What just happened ? Do it . - I said , just do it . - What ? david : Shouldn 't we cover them up ? DEL : No . It 's a crime scene . DEL : Don 't touch them . You can get in trouble . Can I at least have a pee ? Yeah . But use the ladies ' . And knock first . There should be three bodies in here . DEL : There 's no sign of the preacher anywhere . I 've checked all over . There 's no blood trails , nothing . Do you think he could 've disappeared like what 's her name ? GARRETT : How 's your head ? What do you think ? My head hurts . You suckered me . What happened in there ? - Untie me , I 'll give you the whole story . - Right . Lady , you got me all wrong . All I want to do is get out of here . I give you my word , I won 't hurt anyone . Cathy , get away from him . - He 'll say whatever you want to hear . - I thought we were done . We 're done now . - ls it bad in there ? - We couldn 't find the preacher 's body . ANDREW : The preacher 's body ? Doesn 't make any sense . SARAH : What did you find ? GARRETT : Nothing . The same . This is so whacked , man . Okay , people , the way I see it , we 've only got two options . We stay , or we go . Now , I can 't fly in this weather . But if someone were willing , they might be able to hike back into town . JACK : How far is it ? DEL : Seventeen miles . Seventeen miles in this weather ? It 'll never happen . I can do it . - Man , you 're tripping . - You 'll freeze to death . I was in Operation Frozen Shield , ma 'am . Four months of winter survival training in the Ural Mountains . I think I can make it . And if we stay ? Try to fix the radio . Maybe we can get a signal out . Maybe the phones will come back . Sooner or later , the road will clear and we 'll all be all right . david : How long will that be ? GARRETT : Who knows ? But if we stay together we 're all better off . Why don 't you just come out and say it ? - We stay together , we can watch each other . - Cover each other 's backs . In case one of us is one of them . One of what ? Lady , you crazy . We all know what she 's talking about , so why don 't we just say it ? gloria : Aliens . david : Oh , my God , you 're all hysterical . ANDREW : How do you explain people vanishing in a wisp of smoke ? I don 't have to believe we 've been invaded by a bunch of little green men . This is getting us nowhere . I want to know how come she 's got all the guns ? I have the guns because I 'm in charge . - ln charge of what ? Watching people die ? - No one 's going to die . Tell that to the police in there and that bitch with the nice ta-tas . Look , let 's just go . We 'll just load up the plane and fly out of here . - Let somebody else deal with the mess . - Amen to that . I have got a business meeting tomorrow . Sir , I can 't leave . The plane won 't fly . Can you understand that ? We are not taking off in this weather . - Nobody wants to hear about your meeting . - You got that right . I just don 't believe this . Is this your idea of customer service ? - Just relax . - Do not tell me to relax ! So who 's she ? She 's a pilot . So she can fly . That puts her in charge ? Exactly . Who the hell ... . [ All talking at the same time ] Hey ! Let me explain it to you . This is my airport and my charter service . You don 't like it ? Get the hell out . I understand you people are scared and confused . We all are . But as long as I am here I will not tolerate this hysteria . Is that clear ? I am the alpha female , people . What I say goes . Someone wants to question that ... do it now . [ Jack chuckles ] Gloria , how many passengers were confirmed this morning ? I think four or five . That means , three or four others were buying new seats . This is beyond tweaking , you 're acting like you 've been hitting the pipe . We all saw the same thing . I didn 't see aliens . No E.T. , no Mr. Spock . I saw a woman who disappeared . Far as I know , he probably loaded his gun with evaporating bullets or something . SGT . GRlFFlN : Please . DARlAN : What ? What , you dissing me , man ? Don 't make me slap the white off you . There 's no technology capable- - You think I don 't know about technology ? I watch the Sci-Fi Channel . I know about that Area 51 stuff . I can try and make it into town , get some help . I don 't mind . GARRETT : I 'd rather have you with us . At least for now . See what happens in the morning . - Should we check their luggage ? - Whose ? - Whose do you think ? The aliens ' . - Stop with the alien talk , for heaven 's sake . Nobody 's going through my luggage . That 's all . SARAH : Is that right ? DARlAN : That 's right . DARlAN : Who 's going to try it . You ? SARAH : It is so unnecessary . Please , just stay out of my face . gloria : Can we please stop acting like children- - david : All right , everybody freeze ! Put it down ! GARRETT : I 'm putting the gun down . It 's okay . Whoa , buddy , what 're you doing ? - Just stay back , please . - Okay , we 'll stay back . Just stay calm . GARRETT : Mister ... . david : Don 't " mister " me . david : I don 't know what is going on here , but I 'm leaving . I 'm not staying here . Understand ? All right , just put the gun down , man . Nobody wants to get shot . You and I will get in that airplane . You 're flying me out . - I can 't . - You will . I can 't . Mister , please , what 's your name ? I don 't want to tell you my name . David Higgins . Mr. Higgins , please , just calm down . david : You could be one of those things . You could all be ! Hey , buddy , we 're as human as you are . All right ? - Stay back , please . - It 's okay , Mr. Higgins . All right . I know you 're scared . Just give me the gun . Who are you ? Just stay away from me ! - You 'll get hurt here , sir . - Please . Give me the gun , now . david : Please . You shot him . [ Slow , dramatic music plays ] He 's gone . You killed him . SARAH : Look , nothing 's happening . DEL : He was a person . He wasn 't one of them . I didn 't know . I didn 't know . Okay , folks , let 's try this again . You don 't want to do that . Toss it here . Left hand . That gun , too . Anyone tries to buffalo me ... go for a gun , go for help , I won 't think twice about putting you down . Now you listen to me , and you 're going to stay alive . You understand ? You . I want to see you in private . The rest of you sit tight . How can I get out of here ? - You 're free . Go . - You know what I 'm talking about . - I can 't take off in this weather . - The weather will change . Even if the storm stopped ... we 'd still have to clear the runway and de-ice the wings . JACK : Okay , what else ? Promise me nobody else gets hurt . They might not even be people . What if they are ? I 'm not leaving them behind . They could all be aliens . We figure out who 's who . I see . We just take the ones that are us and leave the rest behind . Okay . How ? I have your word , right ? No one gets hurt . No one dies . I want your word . Or you can shoot me and fly your own damn self out of here . DEL : Okay . This is the lonitech Corporation 's DSR 4400 Series x-ray machine . Features a folded photo diode display with horizontal beam orientation ... non-reflective shielding , colour-enhanced video display monitor ... and a conveyor belt capable of a 500-pound individual load . This is the latest in security technology . You 're not seriously suggesting we go through that like baggage ? It could be the only way of proving who 's human and who 's not . Or the only way of giving us all cancer . I 'm not doing it . Whoever passes gets on that plane . Whoever doesn 't , doesn 't . My wife and I will go first . - Don 't volunteer me . - I 'm negotiating . We 'll go first but when we get to the other side , I want two first class seats . It 's a charter plane . All the seats are the same . Some must be better than others . SARAH : I 'm not getting inside that machine . ANDREW : Yes , you are . Great . Now he knows my name . The killer knows my name . What will he do , send you a Christmas card ? JACK : Cut the chatter . DEL : Would it help if I go first ? Ain 't no way that thing will hold you , chubby . DEL : Hey . It 's the 4400 . It 's upgraded for maximum security . Can hold a 500-pound load of freight or baggage . You better take off your shoes , then . We have no way of knowing if this will work . There 's no guarantee it 'll tell any difference ... between any of us or any of them . gloria : He 's got a point . GARRETT : Let 's just try it . DEL : We send pets through all the time . [ Machine whirs ] See ? Not a problem . [ Machine beeps and alarms go off ] Oh , my God , he 's one of those things ! ANDREW : Kill it . DEL : Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! ANDREW : What 're you waiting for ? It 's just my ... . It 's just my extra magazine . Sorry about that . Can I get my gun back now ? GARRETT : You be good to your word , we 'll be good to ours . JACK : All right , who 's next ? We are . Ladies first . [ Clanking of jewellery ] - I 'll be right behind you . - Shut up . GARRETT : Okay , you 're next , Gloria . Please ... . This really isn 't necessary , is it ? Cathy , I can 't . I 'm afraid , I 'm terrified . I 'm claustrophobic . GARRETT : I 'd vouch for you , Gloria , but the others will probably feel safer if we all go . Don 't worry , it won 't hurt you . You 're next , killer . Me ? What about her ? What about you ? Because I say so . I 'll shoot anyone who doesn 't do what I say . Man has a point . Listen to the man . What the hell ? [ Machine beeps loudly ] That doesn 't look right . [ Alarm goes off ] [ Banging and clanking ] ANDREW : What is that ? david : Be careful . You don 't know what 's in there . [ Muted shouts coming from machine ] DEL : Gloria ? JACK : Back away . [ Loud banging and screaming coming from machine ] [ Series of loud explosions ] Hello . This is Allen Air 01 . Come back . [ Radio emits static ] david : Anyone , this is Allen Air 01 . Anybody . Give it a rest . You 've been at that for half an hour . This is an airport . The radios have to work in all weather . I 'm sure you have a point . I sell electronics equipment and something about this just isn 't right . Something 's not right about a lot of things , Armani . Seems like it should work , but the signal 's scrambled . Alien jamming , babe . SARAH : So what do they want ? ANDREW : I don 't know . Whatever it is , they 're willing to kill for it . SARAH : And what are we supposed to do ? david : Disappoint them . - Who was the last person that used this ? - Gloria . The old broad ? I trusted her . - I thought I knew her . - You never really know anybody . There must be a way to get a message out and let people know we 've been invaded . Boo . How 's the weather out there , boss ? It 's snowing . Soldier ? We put him in the bathroom with the others . I 'll need some more clothes . Pack me a bag . It 's cold in Canada this time of year . - I don 't know your sizes . - Work it out . You , help her . Yo , Cap . Got to get something to eat . DARlAN : What 's up with the grub ? Kitchen 's closed . Try the vending machines in back . - Cool with you , boss ? - Yeah . Yo , Armani , let 's eat . - You 're letting everyone out of your sight . - Yes , I am . Any one of them could be one of those things . Makes no difference to me . You 're my pilot . That 's all I care about . - Where are the kids ? - Damn ! You stay . I 'll find them . What 're you afraid of ? I can 't go anywhere . One way or another , Jack , you 're gonna have to trust me . All right , go , but bring them back quick . And be careful . [ Shrill wind blows ] Anybody in here ? [ Slow , suspenseful music plays ] [ Clanking ] GARRETT : Kids , is that you ? [ Eerie whisper-like sounds ] GARRETT : Kids , what 're you guys doing in here ? - Nothing . - Nothing ? What 's that behind you ? HANNAH : Radio . STEPHEN : We were just playing . Is this working ? Did you hear anything ? Any voices ? No , just ... . [ Hannah makes static-like shushing sound ] Want to play a game ? kids : Sure . GARRETT : It requires you to be extra alert . I 'm going to try to call someone on the radio . I want you both to stand over here , okay ? If you see or hear anybody , I want you to tell me right away . - Okay ? - Okay . Let 's start . CQ 1 , this is Allen Municipal Airport . Come in , please . [ Radio emits static ] CQ 1 , this is Allen Airport . We have an emergency . Please come in . GARRETT : If anyone hears me , we 've an emergency crisis ... that requires law enforcement personnel . Yeah . That 's what I 'm talking about . Armani , come check this out . What 's your preference , man ? - Nothing for me . - You aren 't eating ? My diet doesn 't allow for high fats or processed sugars . Say what ? High glucose levels stimulate a hyper-insulin imbalance in my body ... which could result in diabetic reactions or altered mood swings . Meaning you can gun down more than one person a day . I 'll have a candy bar . I 'm going to get some more . All out . Got any change ? No . Yeah , baby ! Always wanted to do that . That 's what I 'm talking about . So , what does a well-dressed convict wear on the run ? The important thing to remember is to travel light . You don 't want too much weight . ANDREW : Yeah , so we start with socks and underwear . SARAH : That 's a good idea . So . We got you two pairs of shoes , socks , three shirts , and a pair of pants . - Winter gear ? - You could just wear the parka you came in . No , it 's state issue . Take my credit cards , buy whatever you need there . Just give him the keys to our house . No offence , but I 'd like to see him leave . - Which bags are yours ? - These . Why do you want to see them ? I 'm curious , and you have excellent taste in clothes . He thinks we might be like the others . Aliens . But we went through that machine . Andrew , I don 't want him going through our bags . Tell him . Sarah , he 's not deaf . Are those the kids ' bags ? - That 's probably a good assumption . - What 's in them ? - I don 't know . - Don 't you pack their clothes ? I would if I had kids . Wait a minute . You mean that ... . Those aren 't our kids . [ Ominous music plays ] Follow me . Don 't let anyone in unless you hear from me . david : What 's up ? ANDREW : Something about the kids . [ Suspenseful music plays ] CQ 1 , this is Allen Municipal Airport . Come in , please , we have an emergency . CQ 1 , this is Allen Municipal Airport , come in . We have a situation that requires immediate law enforcement personnel . GARRETT : CQ 1 , this is Allen Municipal Airport . Come in , please . CQ 1 , this is Allen Airport , we have an emergency . Come in . Jack . Garrett . - Everything all right ? - Fine . Found the kids . So I see . Can I speak to you in private ? No , don 't leave me . GARRETT : It 'll be just for a second . STEPHEN : No . I 'm afraid of the bad man . You want to use the radio , too ? We have a crisis that requires law enforcement personnel . It 's not working . - Step away from the kids . - What ? Just do what I say . No , he wants to hurt us . He 's a bad man . - That 's not true . - Yes , it is . He 's a very bad man . You stop moving . I 'm not afraid of you . Jack , what is going on ? The kids , Garrett . They 're not kids . No . Let go of her , you . Trust me on this . I said , let go ! [ Voice lowering unnaturally ] Now where would be the fun in that ? [ Eerie instrumental music plays ] [ Garrett yells out in pain ] We 're going to go now , quietly and very quickly . [ Alien monster roars ] [ Tense , suspenseful music plays ] Kids these days . I 'm full . Me , too . Why are we here , Andrew ? ANDREW : I believe we 're hiding . No , I mean this vacation . Why now ? You 've never taken off work before . Isn 't that reason enough ? Are you having an affair with that woman ? No . I thought that she was a loudmouthed pain in the ass . Only reason I talked to her was to make you jealous . Why ? Because when you and I argue ... . Yeah ? When we argue it 's just about the only time that you and I feel real . I don 't want to live like that . Me either . I think we 're going to be just fine . Is that your professional opinion ? We 're safe . If we can hold out till morning , somebody 's bound to come looking for us . What then ? Tell them aliens took over the damn airport ? They 'll lock us up and throw away the key . You can 't argue with the evidence . Let 's just get out of here , Andrew . Maybe that soldier was right , we can make it out on foot . I know we don 't have any ... survival training but ... we skied Aspen . We did cross-country in Saint Moritz . - You won 't last 15 minutes out there . - Shut up . Shut up . You killed that soldier , the one person that might be able to help us . - That was an accident . - I seen him . - Please . - It 's true . I didn 't want to hurt that boy . Cut the man some slack . It was an accident . That might help you sleep at night but it isn 't a defence . You 're saying that I could be prosecuted ? No one could blame me in such a situation . There were extenuating circumstances . The gun just went off . I didn 't mean to pull the trigger . [ Sarah shushes the others as she hears the children laughing ] [ Knocking on door ] Who is it ? HANNAH : It 's just us . STEPHEN : Can we come in ? [ Children laugh ] STEPHEN : Quit it . Honey , we 're not supposed to let anybody in . HANNAH : Why not ? STEPHEN : We 'll be good . HANNAH : Yeah . We promise . Whose kids are they ? They 're not mine . They 're not yours . What the hell ? STEPHEN : Please ? No . We don 't know who they are . And what are they doing here without parents ? Listen to us . They 're children , for God 's sake . No . No , I don 't think they are . At least , I don 't know . Kids . STEPHEN : You 'll be sorry . [ ln low alien 's voice ] You 'll be very sorry . Let 's put something in front of the door , shall we ? JACK : That should buy us some time . GARRETT : It 'll have to . I owe you a thank you for saving my ass back there . See , Jack , you do care for people . I need a pilot . The only thing I care about is getting me the hell out of here . - What is this place ? - Engineering hangar . GARRETT : There 's a mechanic who flies in when a plane needs servicing . - What 's under there ? - I 'm guessing a plane . - Don 't get cute . Will it fly ? - I don 't know . JACK : It 's got skis , right ? That won 't help without an engine that runs . This thing 's old . So we don 't have to plough any runway or de-ice the wings . - How far is Canada ? - ln this ? Two hours . Maybe less . Let 's get it started . I just got my way out of this mess . As far as I can tell , he 's finished replacing the pistons . - The casings are locked down . - Will it fly ? First we got to get it started . We 'll need fuel . Hand me the booster on that dolly . I 'm on it . I 'm still worried about those kids . ANDREW : Are they gone ? I thought I heard something before . It 's nothing . Why would anybody leave two kids alone in an airport ? SARAH : What 're you doing ? Trying to find something to arm ourselves with . I can 't even find any steak knives . What about this ? What the hell 's that ? What are people in an airport using a thing like this for ? Avalanches . Avalanches ? To clear avalanches . - You 've seen one of these before ? - No . Then how do you know it 's for avalanches ? Says it on the box . What kind of bullets are these ? ANDREW : Uses sound .

JACK : Very perceptive . Right on top of it , Garrett . Shut up , Jack . [ Suspenseful , dramatic music plays ] SARAH : Garrett , I 'm seeing something moving . Okay , it 's just a shadow , but ... . I 'm confused . What camera 's this ? Don 't go back . I see it . SARAH : Okay , it 's on the move . Garrett ? I 'm losing you a little . Can you ... . Where are you ? GARRETT : Baggage room . [ Whispering ] Darian 's at the far end of this hall . Wait . - I 've lost it . - What do you mean you lost it ? Oh , God , it went around a corner . Just hold on , just stay put . DARlAN : What 's up ? JACK : Quiet . We got to get out of here , now . - I thought you left me . - Yeah . I tried . - You 're funny for a white guy . - We got work to do . I got him . He 's okay .

[ Fast-paced tense music plays ] [ Alien monster roars ] SARAH : Come on ! Come on ! Oops . SARAH : Looks like we made it . GARRETT : Yes , we did . We was going to fly in that ? DARlAN : How 's that duct-tape special fly ? JACK : Elbow grease and a lot of luck . I hear that , but how we all going to fit in that ? You two are on your own . What ? You 're free to go . Once Garrett drops me over the border , she 's free , too . You kept your word , I 'll keep mine . You know , for a killer convict escapee , you 're all right . I mean that in a good way . Thanks a lot . For everything . [ Phone rings ] [ Phone continues ringing ] If you 're ready . DARlAN [ ln woman 's voice ] : Hello ? Yes ! Thank God , yes . I 've been trying to get through to you for hours . - No . - He 's killed everyone . And now he 's after me . That 's him . Yes , that 's him . He 's coming . Help me . Hurry ! Surprise , surprise . It was you all along . I should 've known by that lame rap of yours . I be working on it ... bro . What a resilient species you are . Even now when all is clearly lost ... your instincts for survival still burn on . I like that . We haven 't done anything to you . What do you want ? We mean to rule . - Rule us ? - Slave labour . It 's what we do . Travel from planet to planet ... searching for inferior beings to master and collect . And we found ourselves a cash crop . Hate to say it , but so far tonight you ain 't shown me squat . The body count 's five to five and the sun isn 't even up yet . The ones you destroyed were soldiers , dispensable . I 'm a leader . You mistakenly stumbled into one of our little training missions . But soon ... very soon , we 'll be ready for Phase Two : DARlAN : Collection . GARRETT : We 'll fight you . We 'll fight you with everything we have . We 'll never be anyone 's slave . See ? You humans have spirit . The will to survive . Those with spirit have a much longer shelf life . SARAH : What is that ? Much more effective than simple handcuffs . Watch . Put it on . I won 't ask again . [ Eerie music plays ] Sarah . What happened here ? He killed my husband . That son of a bitch . Jack . He killed them all . DARlAN : Nice witness . DARlAN : I 'll take that . I 'm sorry . I don 't know what happened . It was like being outside of my body . Your turn . No . - Put it on . - I won 't . Then I 'll kill him . Hours ago , you 'd have done anything to see him dead . And now . - Stop it . - Why do you care for him ? Tell me why . Because he 's another human being . We trust each other . We care about each other . You actually think this murderer cares for anyone besides himself ? You 're free to go . That 's what you wanted , wasn 't it ? Your freedom ? Leave her now and you 'll have a chance . Stay here and you 'll all die together . I 'm sorry , Garrett . Probably hate myself for this in the morning , but ... I told you how it was . Human nature . It 's a bitch . [ Darian laughs ] Garrett , is that the gun I gave you ? I think it is . Why ? JACK : It 's important . When you went looking for the kids , is that the gun ? Yeah . What do you care ? Just leave , Jack . She 's no longer your concern . Don 't make me retract my offer to let you live . JACK : Sorry , bub . But you don 't know jack . JACK : That hog leg ain 't loaded . GARRETT : What ? You gave me a gun with no bullets ? Seemed like a good idea at the time . Get out of here . I misjudged you , Jack . You are as stupid as the rest . Come on , convict , you can do better than that . Not bad , but not good enough . SARAH : You bastard ! I 'll kill you ! This is foolish , Jack . Why you doing this ? Because we don 't like you . [ Darian screaming ] Ow . It 's all right . Sissy . Here . Andrew was a bit smaller than you , but they should still fit . Anyway ... I assume you 're not much for goodbyes , so ... . Okay . Hey , Garrett ... thanks . GARRETT : For what ? Giving me a chance . [ Police sirens in distance ] They 're playing my song . I got to go . I still owe you a ride . A deal 's a deal . Come on . JACK : So , do you have any plans tonight ? GARRETT : No , I 'm kind of winging it . JACK : How about dinner ? GARRETT : Drinks on you , right ? JACK : Not a problem . JACK : Took Fancy Boy 's pants and it 's stuffed with cash . GARRETT : Jack . [ Dramatic instrumental music ] Subtitles by Softitler

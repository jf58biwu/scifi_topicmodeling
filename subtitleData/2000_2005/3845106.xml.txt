 - Where the hell is Marguerite ? - I don 't know . I count at least three . Make that two . - We can 't keep running forever . - Dammit . We have to end this quickly ; before they get reinforcements . On three . One ... two ... three . What are they waiting for ? Down ! Is that all of them ? - For the moment . - Where is Marguerite ? She came this way and there looks like there was a struggle . Hers ? Wherever she is and whatever it takes ; we 'll find her . Ah so you do care after all . Where the hell have you been ? Blind date . Shhhh . Do you hear that ? The place is infested with them . Whoa. whoa. whoa . What do you think you 're doing ? We need to scare them . What we need to do is get out of here before they spot us . Marguerite that 's a human grave . And ? Dead is dead . - It won 't make any difference to him . - It makes a difference to me . Well , throw some dirt on him and let 's get out of here . Is that a mummy ? It 's Egyptian . Yeah right ; and the stream we draw our water from that 's the Nile . May Anubis God of the dead torment the souls of any who disturb this grave . A curse . Fascinating . Look , give me a hand . What are you doing ? This is a monumental find . You saved this guy the indignity of being dug up by cannibals just so you could do it . This mummy may be the key to mysteries thousands of years old . Did you see that ? - See what ? - His hand it twitched . You almost had me there . - I 'm not kidding . - Oh , don 't be ridiculous . - I don 't know Challenger . - It was an illusion the earth slipping away from the body . Oh my God . At the dawn of the century A band of adventures set out to prove the impossible The existence of a prehistoric world The Visionary The Heiress The Hunter The Scientist and The Reporter All chasing the story of a lifetime Stranded in a savage land Befriended by an untamed beauty Together they fight to survive In this amazing world of lost civilizations and terrifying creatures Always searching for a way home A way out of ... the Lost World Can you imagine what those cannibals might have done if we 'd left him ? How was I supposed to know he wasn 't dead ? We 'd better hurry ; those cannibals will be coming back and they 'll bring friends . Shhh.shhh try not to talk . Quickly now ... - we need to get him out of here . - Can you stand ? Who are you ? I think the introductions can wait . I 'm fine thank you . I am Ramses Thirteen Pharaoh to my people . We 've mapped the western area ten miles out ; - ... and still nothing . - Maybe the others have had better luck . Maybe . I 'm sorry I know how much you want to find a way off the plateau . Well , as thrilling as this place is , I ... hadn 't planned on making it a one way trip . You have a life to get back to , you all do . Some more than others . Why does a Christian God find it necessary to create so many flying pests that bite ? - That was too close . - It had us ... why didn 't it attack ? I wish I knew . A T-Rex nest there 's your answer . The raptor 's belly was already full . How horrible . It 's magnificent . Professor what are you doing ? Challenger will want to add this to his collection . Professor put that down . Oh come ; Veronica the mothers obviously abandoned the site . A T-Rex never abandons her nest . She 'd die first . Point taken . Let 's get out of here . Oh this is impossible . Tell that to the pharaoh . Do you have any idea what this would mean ... to discover a living culture that is the embodiment of Egypt ... the most glorious civilization of the ancient world ? You have heard of my ancestral land ? Of course we have . And your ancestors managed to end up here ? Our history tells of a noble king ... who vowed to rid our land of a murderous band of runaway slaves . Really ? He succeeded in driving them out of Egypt ... but the heathens prayed to powerful Gods . The sea itself turned against us ; swallowed up my ancestors . Let me guess , the survivors wandered in the desert for forty years . A hundred . Their journey finally brought them here . Oh this really is the find of the century . I 'm really beginning to hate those things . Don 't worry about me ; Gunga Din can fend for herself . Well that time it wasn 't close at all . We may not have found a way off the plateau ... but at least we 've got something to bring back to dinner hmmm . Well the first thing I do when I get home is eat something I don 't have to kill . - You 'd miss the excitement . - Well this part I won 't miss . The T-Rex she followed us . She must have sniffed out the fresh kill . I vote we leave it for her give her an easy meal . - Better the raptor than us . - Let 's go . May I enter ? I get the feeling you don 't normally have to ask first . Only when entering the chamber of a Queen . Well in that case my castle is your castle . So how did you survive being buried alive ? The Gods protected me . They summoned the serpent to burrow a whole near my face . Lucky you . It was a sign of my divine right to rule ... a judgment against Nefertiti , my sister . Your sister had you buried alive ? When my father died she saw her chance , and killing me made her the only heir to the thrown . Now my people have to suffer her murderous rule . Well so much for your delicate flower theory . And I am left with nothing ... to offer my beautiful savior . Offer me ? A woman like you deserves the riches of a kingdom . Riches as in gold , jewels ? More than you can count . No it 's absolutely out of the question . All I 'm saying is we keep him alive ... long enough to warn his people of his sister 's treason . I am not a hired gun . He goes back by himself she 'll just kill him again . Probably do a better job of it this time . - Thank you . - So we shouldn 't go back . It 's his world he not gonna just give it up . Marguerite this isn 't our fight . I don 't believe you two . A reporter ; and you , you call yourself a visionary ? Pharaohs in the jungle Challenger ... it 's the eighth wonder of the world . And what has he offered you ? Excuse me ? Well we all know what drives you Marguerite . Do we ? Gold - jewels or is it money ? Don 't get self righteous on me Challenger . Gold - glory we 're all driven by something . I know you want this find . So do whatever it takes to convince yourself you 're being noble we leave in an hour . My God did you see the size of that thing ? Yes very humbling . Our guns would be pea shooters against her . Luckily brains won out over brawn hey Roxton ? * What 's the matter ? - She left the raptor . - Maybe she didn 't see it . - Uh uh . - You think she 's hunting us ? Not us . Me ? You think she 's hunting me ? You touched her egg ; your scent is in her nest . She thinks I destroyed her nest . If that 's the case she 'll be doubling back soon . We need to move we 'll use this to try to create a false trail . - Try to slow her down . - This way . That 's not the way to the treehouse . We 're not going to the treehouse Summerlee . Unless you want her to follow us home ? No ... no ! This is it ? One pyramid , a dozen people ? This is our place of worship , our civilization lies many days to the west . So what are they doing ? It 's a coronation . The pyramid is my father 's tomb . The priests transfers his power to Nefertiti making her the next pharaoh . It 's remarkable . Get down . I thought you said everyone would be pleased to see you ? And they will be , when we kill her . Praise to Ra ! You never said anything about killing your sister . I wish it could be different , but to reclaim my kingdom it 's the only way . - It 's out of the question . - You lied to me . No I mislead you perhaps , but only because I feared you wouldn 't come . You 're right we wouldn 't have . But you must help me ; I need your strength , your weapons . We didn 't sign up for murder . Why bother to save me only to condemn me now ? You have your life . My life , my life belongs to my people . How can I live while they remain enslaved ? If Nefertiti isn 't stopped , I won 't be the only one buried alive . Ramses I 'm sorry I wish we could help you but we are not going to kill your sister . No of course not . I let my passion take hold of me , but killing her I mustn 't lower myself to her level . You said your people would follow you if they knew the truth . They would but as long as Nefertiti wields the scepter of Ra no one will dare challenge her . The scepter of Ra ? It is the symbol of the Pharaoh 's divine power . Whoever holds it controls the kingdom . So if hypothetically you were to get hold of the scepter ? Nefertiti would have no choice but to concede the throne to me . A bloodless coup . All right I 'm listening . We must act tonight while Nefertiti keeps vigil in my father 's burial chamber . Tomorrow she 'll return to our kingdom and surround herself with a hundred guards . So this is her last night in the tomb ? - Alone . - Her and a dozen guards . No only two at the entrance . If we make it that far . That should do it . We can 't risk a bigger fire . As far as I 'm concerned this hole is an oasis . Oh just to sit down . heaven . Well at least we won 't starve . Would you like some professor ? I don 't think I 've got the energy to chew . Is this really necessary we must have lost the beast hours ago ? I 'm afraid you don 't understand . It 's not just a hungry animal Professor . It 's a personal vendetta . Try to get some rest . I didn 't realize eyelids cold hurt so much . Poor thing he 's had quite a day . Just one more adventure to tell his grandchildren when he gets back home . Veronica , if we do find a way off will you come with us ? This is my home ; I have no reason to leave . Not even for Malone ? Ned already has someone . Not like you he doesn 't . No , me I can take down a raptor climb a hundred foot tree or knife a snake at twenty paces . But I 'd never know which fork to use . So you 're interesting , you 're unique . I 'm not a publisher 's daughter . Gladys isn 't your problem , she 's Malone 's . If you care about him - tell him . Let him work it out . I 'll take first watch . All right . Oh Veronica , trust yourself and Malone . I am risen . - Come on lets get inside . - Oh I think you broke my nose . You 're fine let 's go . One day I 'm gonna strangle that woman . Take a number . This is incredible , it 's magnificent . Was it someone you knew ? The pyramids architect . He gave his life so he could become one with his creation . - Killed himself ? - He was sacrificed . Gotta love tradition . Now his spirit either curses or protects those who enter . Any word on which way he 's leaning with us ? This way . I claim what is rightfully mine . How dare you enter this holy place ! Is that any way to welcome your brother back from the dead . Let our father welcome you when I have sheathed my dagger in your heart . Easy now , no one needs to get hurt . Who are these demons that accompany you ? We 're just trying to restore the balance of power . Before you had Ramses buried alive that is . Fiend - spawn of Set . I prefer you call me Pharaoh . - Any sign of her ? - None . - She must have given up . - Uh uh . Not convinced . Let 's make it home alive then I 'll be convinced ; time to wake Summerlee ... - ... and for us to get going . - Give him a minute . He could use the rest . Nonsense my child I 'm as fit as a fiddle . Of course you are , let 's go . Are you all right ? Just tweaked my back should settle in a minute . Oh he 's all right , aren 't you Summerlee ? I tell you what Veronica and I will take point you watch our backs . In case that things still out there . Thank you John , you can count on me . Good man . Run Summerlee ! Move it ! Come on . come on. come on ! We are Ramses risen from the dead . Osiris himself kneeled before us . Bidding us return from the underworld to lead our people into a new age of conquest , of glory . Blessed by Ra our power is infinite . Demon you are cursed not blessed . Devil - perversion of darkness . Now.now who had who buried alive ? No killing her Ramses that was the deal . But of course not that would be barbaric . A conscious now from the monster who murdered his own father . - What ? - Oops . - Murder ? Why do I get the feeling we backed the wrong horse . I 'll see your corpse rot for this brother . You won 't be seeing anything for much longer dear sister . Perhaps you should have let me kill her . You evil son of a bitch . I am Pharaoh beyond good and evil . Here , ample compensation for your trouble . and your weapons . This has not been a good day . Ramses manipulated us from the moment we dug him up . Yeah , that was our first mistake . We can 't leave him in power . Was I at the wrong party or did we actually have a choice in the matter ? - We have to go back . - Wait Challenger how do you plan to dethrone him ? - I don 't know . - Brilliant ! - Why didn 't we think of that ? - Do you realize what we 've done ? Yes thank you I am well aware . All I am saying is there 's some things you can 't undo . He 's right Marguerite we 've got to try . How ? In case you 've forgotten he took our guns . We 'd be lucky to make it back to the treehouse alive . Let 's at least rearm ourselves before we play cavalry . It would be too late by then as long as Nefertiti is alive she 's a danger to him . - He 's right we don 't have a choice . - Fine ! You two want to go off and get yourselves killed have fun . It 's a matter of honor . What good is honor to you if you 're too dead to enjoy it ? Hey ! I 'm not going with you . I 'm not . George Don Quixote , as if there aren 't enough ways to die out here already . - We 'll never out run it . - I 'm slowing you down . - No , I didn 't mean it like that . - No time to argue people . Roxton what on earth are you doing ? We 're going to need a tourniquet . - For what ? - Blood it 's the strongest scent of all . - There 's got to be another way . - Well I 'd do it myself ... I 'm sorry Summerlee but it 's you she wants . I 'm afraid he 's right Professor . The more blood around the less likely she 'll be able to pick up the real trail . It 's your curse you 're just too charming ; - ... you 're her man . - Just do it . Hot isn 't it ? Not exactly the kind of stones I was hoping for . Thanks for coming back to warn us . You kidding ? It had nothing to do with you . Really ? If I show up without the two of you what was I supposed to tell the others ? More trouble that it 's worth . If it means anything , I 'm proud of you . Thank you - it doesn 't . Uh.uh not that way . You can 't be serious . We can be the hunter or the hunted ; it 's your choice . I don 't see Nefertiti . He must have sealed her inside the pyramid . * - Let 's go find out . - No , first things first . Let 's get our weapons back then we can dig her out . - She could be dead by then . - She 's probably dead now . Come on . Why do I bother ? Just a few more inches . Help would be appreciated . That 's it we 've almost got it . Well what are you waiting for ? - Ladies first . - Age before beauty . - Well technically I was born in 1895 so . - Don 't make me hurt you . There she is . Its okay we 're here to help . What is it ? Who 's there ? Three people who 've made a terrible mistake . Just get her unraveled so we can get out of here . I don 't think so . I suspected something when my guards failed to return . Maybe they took a wrong turn . - Seal them in ! - No ! Save it , its solid stone and a foot thick . Wait it 's ... a foot thick . The tomb is sealed , it 's air tight . There is another exit for the Pharaohs spirit to pass beyond . Well , anytime now . The way will be revealed after death . Mind if we don 't wait that long ? Sorry about the climb Professor . At least this is one terrain she is not suited for . We 'll soon find out . - Well maybe she 's given up . - Would you ? Her babies are dead . Dammit what 's it gonna take to lose that thing ? Me . You can 't be serious ? Oh yes I am child . It 's my scent the mother has in her brain . No reason to sacrifice the two of you as well . Professor you 're coming with us . I 'll carry you if I have to . We 're all in this together . I wish you 'd reconsider my plan . Dying is not part of the plan , let 's go . Dammit , there 's no way around it no way over it . Apparently your right John , we are all in this together . Anything yet ? Yeah , the crops came in nicely . Oh a few wars won woman and slaves taken ; man stuff mostly . You ? Nothing that says exit . Can you give us a better idea of what we 're looking for ? It won 't be a single word . It 's not something meant to be read by the living . Great . How do you talk to the dead ? In a prayer . Yeah a prayer , but to who ? Apis guide to the underworld . Is this guy tall , thin , short what ? He 's a bull . Got him Come and read this . Ra 's love will deliver you . It 's the same here . It 's on all of them . Yes this one too . That 's what these remind me of the mirrors in a periscope . But Ra 's love . What does Ra love ? The sun . Get the torches bring them to the mirror . Hold them close . It worked . - Ramses.Ramses ? - He 's gone . We 're too late ; my people are doomed . Not if we can stop him . Impossible , you don 't know his power . We 've seen worse . Even if I return , he 'll divide my people with civil war . He holds the scepter of Ra . Listen lady nobody buries me alive and gets away with it . We 'll have to travel quickly . I can see shadows , light . Your retinas are seared . Do you think you can keep up with us ? If there 's a chance to save my people . Let 's see , Ramses has our guns ... magic scepter ; armed guards . We have a blind woman and two swords any ideas ? Maybe , give me a minute . Well the wind shifted our scent . She 's confused but not for long . Marvelous creature really . A bit too stubborn from my liking . You were right I should have told Ned . You 'll get your chance . You have a plan ? Seems you were right Professor . There is only one way to stop her . What ? There that should do it . This is the largest one I could find . Yes , that 'll do . There 's not much time . Get it up . Let me see your arm . You need more blood ; anything for the cause . Not this time ; just your bandage . Summerlee ? Come on . There , I 'd say you never looked better . And just in time . Stop Ramses I command you ! I too have returned from the dead brother . Down ! You have returned for the last time you blind pretender . Seize her ! Don 't tell me another surprise return . A resurrection really . - You should have stayed buried . - I could say the same about you . I command you Ra show them your power . The light is mine ! - Now ! - No ! Queen . Well forgive me if I don 't find it amusing . - Oh you wouldn 't precious one . - Malone . Well let 's face it Marguerite he had you fooled . While you two saw right through him ; please . Ned ? You 're back . Yeah we were out with a Pharaoh . - I 'll tell you all about it later . - Ned wait - I ah ... - What , something wrong ? No . I missed you . Yeah ? Yeah . Ah there she is ; the woman who would be Queen . So you 've heard . Congratulations ever heard of knocking ? I guess that Pharaoh guy well ... he was pretty sweet on you huh ? You find something humorous in that ? Me ? No . It may interest you to know that some men ... appreciate the finer qualities in a woman . Well , do tell . Oh a certain air of distinction ; a noble bearing of gentility ... a sensuous passion ... smoldering beneath a thin veil of civility . I see . Of course it takes a special man to ... appreciate these things . Apparently . It 's just a damn shame it took a ... power mad homicidal maniac to bring out the best in you . Well so much for civility . Why are you here ? I just wanted to say hello . Consider it said ; anything else ? Yes ... welcome home . *

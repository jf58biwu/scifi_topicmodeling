 Pilot : The Sheyang vessel is about to fire . Starburst . Starburst now . Moya can 't . She isn 't ready . Zhaan ! Zhaan , do something . D 'Argo . He can help him . No , no , no . He can talk to them . Listen to me . D 'Argo is gone . No D 'Argo , no Aeryn , no Crichton . Just us , okay ? And in a few microts , we 'll be dead , too . No , D 'Argo can save us . He can . He , he has to save us . They 're firing . D 'Argo , we need you . Zhaan ? ! ( echoing screams ) D 'Argo ! D 'Argo . Shake it off . Come on Rock , get off the canvas . You can do it . Rise and shine . Up and at ' em . Break through . Man , this is getting old . The least you can do is talk in your sleep . What would you like me to say ? Whoa . How about great to be back ? Was I away ? You sure as hell were . Days . I don 't know how many . I kind of lost track of time . Do you know who I am ? Yes , I recognize you , John , but I do not recognize this place . Am I dead ? - No . - Am I dead ? ! No . You 're not dead . I , uh ... I thought we were dead . Why aren 't we ? Aeryn . She finally managed to scoop us up , brought us here . Some asteroid . Abandoned mining camp , factory . I don 't know , something like that . Where is she ? She 's in the Prowler , grocery shopping . This rock gets a nine on atmosphere but only two on food and water . We have a lot to thank her for . Yeah . Aeryn : Prowler to Talyn . Crais : What delayed you ? You were supposed to check in two arns ago . I can 't always get away on schedule . Don 't forget , I have to give Crichton a reason for my absence . He still has no knowledge of our arrangement ? Aeryn : None . It might facilitate matters if you explained to him . No . Eventually , you 'll have to . Only when it 's too late for him to interfere . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . A radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship , a living ship , full of strange alien life-forms . Help me . Listen , please . is there anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm being hunted by an insane military commander . I 'm doing everything I can . I 'm just looking for a way home . Crichton : You sure your memory 's okay ? How long was I without oxygen for ? Long enough to scare the hell out of me . What 's the last thing you remember ? Space . Kronite . Gammak base aflame . Magnificent sight . Absolutely . Did Moya get away ? Moya did but Talyn .. . Talyn ? Yeah , Moya 's baby . Awful name . What happened to him ? Crais happened . He made off with the baby . We should neverhave let him live . Yeah , I know . What happened to the Command Carrier ? It 's still in the area . Aeryn has spotted Marauders checking the asteroid field out but they haven 't seen us yet . So now we have to evade Scorpius . And then we have to find Crais , remove him from Talyn . Who the yotz named him Talyn ? I did . After my father . Aeryn , check out who finally woke up from his little siesta . Yes , I have eyes , Crichton . I have eyes as well , and they 're very pleased to see you alive . Hey , yo . What 's the matter ? is there a problem ? All I managed to find was a little water . I 'll have to keep exploring . If this asteroid is unsuitable then we should all leave . Good idea . Change of scenery . No . This is the only asteroid I 've seen with structures that 'll hide you from the Marauder patrols . Yeah , but D 'Argo 's awake . We get out of the asteroid , we signal to Moya , she comes and she picks us up . We don 't even know if Moya is in range and we can 't outrun a Command Carrier . So we have to remain hidden until the Carrier withdraws . What if it never does ? Well , Scorpius can 't look for us forever , and he can 't even be certain that you survived . Aeryn , Scorpius wants me pretty bad . His patience may outlast our Prowler 's fuel . When the Prowler 's fuel runs out we starve . As John once said , I would rather go down on a swing . " Swinging . " That you want to go down " swinging . " Swinging . The only reason we 'll starve is if you don 't stop this useless discussion and let me keep searching for food . - This discussion ... - Aeryn , D 'Argo . Stop it ! Both of you . If not for me you 'd both be dead , all right ? So stop fighting me ! Chiana : Rygel , eat . I can 't eat . What , you ... you can 't eat ? Nnn ... What ? Any fever ? Or dizziness ? Or secretions that are even abnormal for you ? I 'm not sick . I 'm simply not hungry . Ask Pilot why . Bad news , Pilot ? Moya is returning to the asteroid field where she last saw Talyn . What ? There , you see ? is Moya unclear on the concept of why we ran away ? She insists on searching for her offspring despite the risk . A Peacekeeper Command Carrier is slightly more than a risk . Moya and I have chosen a course that should allow us to re-enter the field undetected . But even then , we 're flying back in unarmed , defenseless . We aren 't entirely defenseless . Ha ! As good as . All we have is that antiquated defense screen we took from the wreck of the Zelbinion . This pile of dren ? Well , l-is it even functional ? I 'll have the DRDs give it a thorough going-over . Moya doesn 't understand your distress . Besides Talyn , we might also find Crichton , D 'Argo and Aeryn . If they could have gotten out , they would have by now . All patrols still report nothing , sir . Uh , no signal from Leviathan offspring . No trace of Crichton . Nothing . I comprehend the meaning of nothing , Lieutenant . After Crichton ejected from the Transport , it may have been a mistake to pull back and allow that rogue Prowler to rescue him . Oh , you had little choice , sir . Oh , true . He would have chosen to perish rather than be saved by us . But ... the Prowler eluded capture , and continues to . In a field of this size , we may never find it . Time for a change of tactics . Talyn ! Stop this senseless behavior . You mother has gone . Do you understand ? Moya has abandoned you . What are you doing ? Power down your engines at once . Leaving the protection of the field right now is suicidal . I know you detest all this hiding . You 're a gunship , a warrior . You want to move , to fight . But you 're not yet strong enough to take on a Command Carrier . He 's going berserk . Talk to him ! Talyn . What 's the matter ? Show us . There 's no reason to be afraid . I 'm here . So is Crais . Talyn , we want to help you , please . Let us see what 's upsetting you . Communications . Broadband transmissions . Random noises mixed with distortion spikes . Scorpius . Talyn , these signals mean nothing . They 're intended to alarm you and to make you run . Talyn , do not play into the hands of your enemy . Remain right where you are . You 're brave enough to do that , aren 't you ? ( systems powering down ) Very good , Talyn . Talyn , excuse us for a moment . D 'Argo 's regained consciousness . He and Crichton are eager to leave . And don 't suggest that we simply abandon them because that was not part of our arrangement . We can 't leave just yet . Talyn is still too immature . No weapons , no Starburst and he continues to ignore my commands . You can 't command a Leviathan . You can only persuade . Talyn is part Leviathan , part Peacekeeper . He was designed to take orders . Why don 't you let me talk to him ? Alone . No . I 'm willing to share command of Talyn . I will not relinquish it . - Again ? - Yeah . One , two , three . ( laughing ) Again , I win . No , I win . Paper wraps rock . No , paper cannot possibly beat rock . It does . Paper beats rock . Rock rips through paper . D 'Argo , that 's not how it works . - Paper beats rock . - That is unrealistic . Well , it 's the rules and it 's not supposed to be realistic . It 's supposed to be entertaining . My coma was more entertaining . It 's a kid 's game . Aeryn . Good hunting ? Should we give you a hand ? No need . No. lt 's no problem . What did I say ? I don 't need any help . You know what ? I think you do . I 'm certain you do . This is ridiculous . I have a question . How many times have we saved each others lives ? I 've lost count . Safe to say more than once ? Sure . Right . And how many times have you and I been close ? Just the once . ( clearing throat ) No , no , uh , not that kind of close . Oh , uh , friend close ? Yes . Um ... ( clearing throat ) Um , ' em , ah , ah , more than once . Yeah , right . Well . Whatever our relationship is ... we should be at a place where we can trust one another . I think you 're holding something back . Look me in the eye . Look me in the eye . Tell me that I 'm wrong . You 're not going to like what I have to say . Maybe not . In order to save your lives I had to make a deal with Crais . What ? ! Slow down . Stop . You had to what ? By the time I retrieved you , Moya had gone you were both about to suffocate . And then Crais signaled me from Talyn with the coordinates to an oxygen-atmosphere asteroid . This asteroid . I never would have found it on my own . Not in time , anyway . Back up . What 's your end in this deal ? When Moya left , Talyn got upset , stopped obeying Crais . I agreed to help calm Talyn down and teach him to start obeying Crais 's orders . Oh , well ... that makes sense . You 're helping Talyn obey the guy who kidnapped him ? ! I didn 't have a another choice . You should have let us die . No , I couldn 't have . That offspring has weaponry ! And you 've put that weaponry within the grasp of Crais . Oh , what would you prefer , D 'Argo ? That Scorpius gets Talyn , or destroys Talyn ? Right now , even Crais 's control is better than no control at all . Right now ? ! When exactly is that going to change , Aeryn ? After Crais has brainwashed him he 's going to give him back ? ! I told you you wouldn 't like what I had to say . I don 't ! Neither do I . Yeah , well , it 's all we have . No , it isn 't . All right , we cannot allow Crais to remain aboard Talyn . Do you agree ? Absolutely . She 's going to be pissed when she gets up , though . It was a time-saver . You look after her while I go and break Crais ' neck . D 'Argo , you couldn 't break wind right now . I 'm going . I owe Crais . You think I don 't owe him ? Shoot for it . One , two , three . I 'll see ya . ( chanting softly ) Zhaan ? It 's me . Hello ? It 's me . Chiana . Look , I hate to disturb you while you 're so busy . Well , not that I understand what you 're doing . I mean , I understand it 's part of the Delvian Seek thing so you can become a priest again or ... or something ... . But I don 't see how it works . Not that it 's my business . You have 30 microts . Moya 's got some farhbot idea about going back to the asteroid field to look for her baby even though we 're sure to get captured by Peacekeepers and I don 't have to tell you what happens then . So , I was wondering if you could talk to Pilot so he could talk to Moya to convince her that this bad idea is , well , a bad idea . Did you get all that ? Yes . So , you 'll do it ? No . Aeryn : You 've killed all three of us now . Without Crais and Talyn 's help we 'll never get out of here alive . Do you really think that Crais would return us to Moya once Talyn is under his control ? His word is worth next to nothing . He no longer considers himself a Peacekeeper . Or so he claims . I believe him . He knows Scorpius would have him executed . Oh , then his conversion doesn 't mean much , does it ? Well , perhaps not , but he is a fugitive , just as we are which means that his goals and ours may no longer conflict . If he has deserted the Peacekeepers , then his loyalties lie only to himself , which makes him more dangerous not less . Locking scramble , Security Three Velka . Please confirm . Scramble confirmed . Proceed . The gunship is still ... not my concern . Where 's Crichton ? Officer Sun won 't tell me yet . Building her trust is time-consuming , as is building the gunship 's trust . The latter task is made no easier when the gunship is panicked by your spurious transmissions . Your progress report was overdue , I concluded you were incapacitated , and I attempted to retrieve the gunship . Then it is among your concerns ? As a means to recovering Crichton , no more . Deliver Crichton to me and I will allow you to keep the gunship . Demonstrate some of the formidable patience you 're always bragging you possess . My patience is formidable , Crais ... but it is not infinite . Crais : Talyn , you heard Scorpius . You are not his concern . Merely a tool he can use or barter away . This is how the Peacekeepers treat their own . You , me , Officer Sun . But we are alike now . Orphaned from all we ever knew . We have only one another to rely upon . You must believe me , trust me . Crichton . I know. I know . Sorry . You know , I should have called but I was in the neighborhood , thought I 'd drop in , say hi . How you doing ? Where 's Officer Sun ? Have you harmed her ? You 're asking me if I 've harmed Aeryn ? That 's a winner , Crais . Do Sebaceans have a word for " chutzpah " ? What do you want , Crichton ? Oh , a couple of things . Your head on a platter , for starters . I 'm unarmed . You can kill me easily . Be warned , however . Talyn regards me as a friend . Interesting . I heard that you had a long way to go in that department . I have . Nevertheless , I believe he would react badly to my death and retaliate by killing you . Oh . Well , but if you 're dead , he 's out of your clutches . A fair price to pay , I 'd say . Consider this . Neither of us wants to see Talyn in Scorpius ' hands . Okay . I give . What do you want , Crais ? Simply to escape . To travel deeper into the Uncharted Territories . To re-examine my path . You want to have a midlife crisis ? Fine . Just ditch the firm , head off to Maui , shack up with a supermodel , but you do not get to keep the Porsche ! You don 't get the keys to Moya 's baby . Talyn. lntruder . ( groans ) You 're about to lose your head . Now , tell Talyn to put away the toys . Talyn .. . Now open the hatch . We 're going to go for a little drive . Wha ... ? Pilot ! What the yotz was that ? Moya is accelerating . I know that . I felt it in all three stomachs . She heard a transmission from Talyn . He 's in the asteroid field , apparently in great pain . I 'll try to find out more . Moya 's in full lunatic mother mode . She 'll blunder right into Scorpius ' bad teeth . Ah , that , ah ... module thing of Crichton 's is still operational . We could let Moya go on without us . Mmm , we could . Not that any planet in this vicinity was very hospitable . ( grunts ) Pilot and ... Pilot and Moya didn 't abandon us during Zhaan 's trial . We can 't ditch . We have to stick . Stupid though it may be . There is a transport pod available should you not wish to accompany us . What ? Leave you and Moya ? No . We ... we couldn 't ! Could we ? Uh , no . Oh , we 'd never consider such a thing . ( grunts ) Scorpius : This transmission can only be one thing : a Leviathan distress call . Then if Moya is anywhere in the area , she should come running . But the gunship has not emerged from the asteroid field . If Moya joins her offspring in concealment , we have gained nothing . Nearing the origin of Talyn 's transmission , but there 's no sign of Talyn . He may have fled further into the field . Any other ships around ? None . Wait . A Prowler . Has it seen us ? Apparently , it 's changing course to intersect with ours . It 's been a thrill , Your Frogness . May your afterlife be almost as pleasant as mine . This is odd . The Prowler has not initiated any communications . Not sending word home ? No. ln fact it 's maneuvering as if it wishes to dock . You don 't think ... ? No. lt couldn 't be . Pilot , let it dock . Chiana , but don 't you ... ? - Chiana ... ? Yo , Chi ! What up ? Stay where you frelling are ! How do I know it 's you ? You want to check my birthmarks ? Yeah , maybe . Uh ... Why didn 't you signal ? 'Cause the bad guys might be listening . Okay , so , uh ... so what are you doing with him ? What ? This guy ? I 'm putting this guy back in his cell ! ( grunts ) Whoa ! ( excited laughter ) You survived ! Hey , don 't I always ? Hey , blue . Zhaan . Hey , darling , can you hear me ? Certainly I can hear you , John . I can always hear you . Uh-huh . You okay ? Perfectly . You 're not ... surprised to see me ? Not at all . I apologize for shouting at you , John . ( chuckles ) That 's okay . Um , when exactly was that ? On Litigara . I accused you of not being there for me . I realize now that ... that wasn 't true . Liti ... gara ? I don 't think that I 've been there but I 'm here now . Yes . Your spirit is with me . The flesh is unimportant . No. lt 's kind of important . Whoa ! Oh , ho , oh , I 'm not dead . She thinks I 'm dead . I 'm real . Yes , John . You always will be to me . Oh ! ( groans ) Uh , what the ah , hell ... ? Pilot thinks nothing 's wrong . She 's resumed the Delvian Seek . What ... wait . The Del ... Why didn 't you tell me ? is this supposed to be important ? Oh , you tell me . You 've seen more Delvians than I have . You think that 's a help ? ( sighs ) D 'Argo : Oh , tie . We 're low on food. I 'd conserve your energy , if I were you . For what purpose ? To live longer . If I am to die on this asteroid , I would rather it was sooner than later . Besides , if I die , you can eat me . You don 't look ripe to me . Crichton : Somebody call for a taxi ? Crichton , you succeeded ? I 'm one for two. I 'll give you the details on the way back . Crichton , you must return now . Moya 's made contact with Talyn . Where is Talyn ? About to leave the asteroid field . We 're on the way , Pilot . There 's no mistake , sir . The gunship is leaving the asteroid field and Moya is pursuing . Follow them , but stay well clear of their sensor range . They must not see us , until they are too far from the asteroid field to hide again . But we won 't be able to catch the Leviathan if she Starbursts . She won 't because her offspring can 't . On my signal , cripple both ships . Commando units will take Crichton alive , but I care for no other prisoners . Clear ? Sparky ! How 's my favorite Hynerian ? ( gasping ) Even I 'm pleased to see you . ( gasping ) Are , uh ... are you not well ? ( gasping continues ) Crichton : You got a frog in your throat ? You need a Hynerian heimlich ? Fine . I 'll be fine . ( gasping ) A slight case of the intons . The what ? It 's a Hynerian airway seizure caused by very strong emotions . ( laughing ) I didn 't know you had strong emotions in you , Sparky . Other than greed , of course . A simple reaction to the shock of seeing you again . Pilot : It is good to have you all back aboard . Crichton : We missed you , too , Pilot . Very much . What 's Talyn 's status ? Highly distraught . He continues to flee and won 't even acknowledge Moya 's signals . Pilot , I might have a little more luck . is Moya willing to let me try ? Moya consents . You may proceed . Thank you . Talyn , this is Aeryn . Please answer . Talyn , you don 't have to run from Moya . She only wants to protect you . Look Talyn , I know you 're confused . You 've heard so many voices . But you know that I care about you . At least let me know that you can hear what I 'm saying . Hey , you might want to give it a rest . Poor kid 's confused . He doesn 't know who to listen to . Moya 's still trying to catch him , which can 't be helping matters . No . Look , I 'm going to go have a chat with Pilot . I 'm sorry , Commander . Moya refuses to allow Talyn to get further away . Look , does she not realize that by chasing him , she 's making him more nervous ? She 's convinced she can still get through to him and talk him down . Having found him , she 's terrified at the thought of losing him again . I know. I know. lt 's her kid. it 's her kid . I know that. I know that . Maybe Mom really does know best . There 's no sign of the Command Carrier , right ? None ... yet . ( ethereal , rhythmic ringing ) Zhaan ? Hello , Aeryn . Come in . Crichton said you were chanting . Are you finished yet ? I 'll never be finished . This is a different phase of the Seek . Right . Well , I just wanted to see how you were . I love you . You what ? I love you . Oh , yes , I did hear it the first time and you know what ? I , I ... I love all living beings . The Seek has reopened my eyes to the wonder of the spirit . I am now going to devote my life to enlightenment . Oh . Well , I think that 's , um ... really selfish , actually . You know , before you bliss off completely into oblivion , you might want to have a little look around you , because Moya and Talyn are in danger . Worldly concerns do not interest me now . Oh , really ? Well , then , don 't give me any dren about how much you love me . Love in its most rarefied sense ... Too rarefied for me . I 'm just an ignorant warrior who believes that love means you 're willing to fight and die for your fellow living beings . ( discordant ringing ) You 're an atypical Luxan , Ka D 'Argo . You left your military service to raise a family upon a rural planet . Spare me your disapproval . I don 't . I lived upon a farming community until the Peacekeepers conscripted me . My wife was a Sebacean . Tell me you approve of that . No. I find it repellent . But that reaction , the concept of irreversible contamination was instilled in me by the Peacekeepers . As such , it needs to be questioned , re-examined . A containment cell is a fine place for reflection . True . Pa 'u Zhaan achieved much during her incarceration , but I cannot stay here . Talyn needs me . Too frelling bad . Your hatred of me , though well earned blinds you . I can keep Talyn out of Peacekeeper hands . And I will . You 're not getting back aboard Talyn . Get used to the idea . Re-examine it . I shall . Before you were arrested , were you happy ? Happier than you can ever imagine . Then I envy you . Braca : Both Leviathans are decelerating . Either they have no plan whatsoever , or they 're about to implement one which isn 't immediately apparent . Our wisest move in both cases is the same . Overtake and engage . Well , don 't take your time or anything . You 're sure it 's the Command Carrier , Pilot ? Yes . Closing fast . Firing range in 6,000 microts . Scorpius , he just can 't live without me . Talyn sees the Carrier . He 's powering up his main cannon . Excellent ! Have him aim dead amidships , right in Scorpius 's ... He 's aiming for Moya . Damn it ! What the hell 's he doing ? Talyn says that was a warning shot . He 's sending Moya a demand . What 's he want ? A captain . Talyn 's afraid . He doesn 't know what to do about the approaching Command Carrier . Oh , like we do ? He insists he needs guidance . Ouch . Let 's get that boy some guidance before he turns into a full-blown Menendez brother . I 'll go at once . Talyn demands that we send over Crais . What ? He said he wants Crais ? - He can 't have him . Pilot , get that boy on the phone . He 's unwilling to discuss it further . He says he 'll fire upon us unless we agree to return Crais now . Pilot , evasives . Moya won 't . She doesn 't believe he 'll fire . Pilot , let 's get the defense screen up just in case mama 's wrong . Done . But it may not hold . Man , haven 't you people ever heard of fuses ? Moya 's unhurt , but the defense screen is out . No ? Really ? And another shot would do Moya considerable harm . Scorpius will be upon us in no more than 5,000 microts . I 'm going to take Crais to Talyn . And then what ? We leave Talyn in Crais ' control ? His and mine. I 'll stay aboard Talyn with Crais . Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! For how long ? For as long as necessary to protect Talyn . He 's very intelligent , John . Once he matures , he 'll no longer want a captain . Yeah , but Aeryn in the meantime ... I 'll be there to mitigate any damage that Crais does . Crais is never going to go for that . Yes , he will . He 's already offered to take me with him . And you 'd do that ? I don 't have another choice . There are always choices , Aeryn . The only other choice is death for everyone , Talyn included . Well , I 'm not going to let you go with him . There isn 't another solution . There has to be . We 're out of time . Aeryn . Your nephew wants to see you . ( grunts ) I knew he would , eventually . Officer Sun , make your choice . I want to go with you . Crichton , this is a beneficial turn of events for all concerned , with the happy exception of Scorpius . Crais , I don 't like this plan and I never will . So you better behave yourself with Talyn and Aeryn . 'Cause if you hurt either one of them , I 'm going to hunt you down . You hunt me down . That would complete the symmetry nicely , wouldn 't it ? Last time we stood here , we didn 't say goodbye . And it wasn 't goodbye , as it turned out . Here 's hoping history repeats itself . Talyn , we have returned . We are prepared to guide you out of danger , take you far from the domain of the Peacekeepers . Maneuver very close to Moya and her Starburst will carry us all to safety . What is that ? It 's the Hand of Friendship . It 's the greatest honor it can bestow . Talyn .. . who 's it for ? ( beeping ) Thank you . I humbly accept . No , Talyn . Talyn . ( screaming ) Talyn , what 's happening ? Talyn , what have you done ? What is that ? A neural transponder . A direct interface with Talyn . His senses ... his propulsors ... his weaponry . I command them all . You command him ? Every system . It 's indescribable . It 's a pity you can 't experience it . Crais , we were going to share command of Talyn . - Talyn chose otherwise . He needs both of us . No . We no longer need you . Talyn can only have one master . You may return to Moya . I will not . You must . He and I are of like mind on this . Crais , take that thing off . Take it off . Take it off or I will ! ( laser firing ) ( firing ) Talyn , I 'm not the enemy . We know that . But you cannot stay aboard here . You have 50 microts to get back to your Prowler before we open that passageway into space . Good health , Officer Sun . Pilot , why hasn 't Talyn tucked in close ? We need a Starburst damn soon . In 90 microts . The Carrier will be in range to fire . Then what 's keeping them ? The Prowler has just emerged from Talyn . Who 's aboard ? Officer Sun . She 's asking to return to Moya . Pilot , get her aboard fast . Scorpius : 40 more microts . Braca : Charging all frag cannons . Boarding parties standing by . Fire when at optimal range . Crais : Scorpius . My final progress report . Stay that command . The gunship is secured , and I am resigning my Peacekeeper commission effective immediately . Crais , cease this nonsense . As for Crichton , he is dead . I killed him with my bare hands . My brother is avenged . Here ends my report , Captain . ( growls ) Fire upon both Leviathans . Chiana : Starburst ? I thought Talyn wasn 't ready . He obviously learns a lot faster than we thought . Pilot , is the Prowler aboard ? Yes . Prepare for immediate Starburst . Lieutenant . Your tactical expert claimed ... the gunship 's ability to Starburst ... would not mature for an arn . Send him to me so I might educate him . Yes , sir . Start searching for Moya , on her most probable Starburst vectors . Not the gunship , sir ? After all , with Crichton dead ... Crichton isn 't dead . That 's merely Crais ' small attempt to take revenge upon me . How can you be so sure ? If Crais had killed Crichton , he wouldn 't tell me . Crichton is alive ! And I will find him . If you are going to sit there in a coma , you could at least smile . Sweet D 'Argo . I was just thinking . Part of the Seek ? No , Aeryn was right . As much as I wish to immerse myself in the Seek and in the next level of existence , I cannot abandon you all . I will slow down the Seek . The next level will always there . This one will not . Then we must cherish it while we have it . And we must cherish each other . I failed . Well , you did everything you could . In other words , I failed . Pilot : Officer Sun , Talyn told Moya he was choosing Crais of his own volition . Yeah . For what that 's worth . He 'll contact her from time to time and let her know he 's okay . Well , they say they 'll call home , Pilot , once a week . They never do . Talyn will be all right , won 't he ? Well , he 's young , and he 's going to make mistakes . But he 'll learn . And if Crais ever mistreats him , he 'll bounce him . Maybe Crais won 't mistreat him . He could have killed me , you know . He could have killed all of us and he didn 't . Yeah . Maybe he just needed to save the energy for Starburst . Or maybe he 's changed . Well , you do believe people can change , don 't you , John ? ( chuckles ) Well ? Well , you have . Mmm ? - Mm-hmm . I have . Mm-hmm . But Crais ?

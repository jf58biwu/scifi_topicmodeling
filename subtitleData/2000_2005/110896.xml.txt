Mrs. Watchit says you 're in here all hours- - day and night . Alex , will you please stand still and look at me ! It wasn 'tyour fault . No . It wasn 't my fault . Maybe we should blame Mrs. Watchit for picking up the ring from thejeweler . Or thejeweler for making it . Or the poor bastard who tore the stone from the earth .

" " T , S , Eliot , You wouldn 't know him yet , but he is so depressing , yet so divine . Oh , I 'm sorry . The lending library is temporarily out ofservice . Not to worry . I have them all right here- - every page ofeveryvolume . Can you tell me what 's happening here ? Well , my sources are no longer fully annotated , and my information is some what anecdotal , but I believe what was once onerace , is now two . One above and one below . Two distinct species that have evolved . - And how do those below survive ? - Thatis therealquestion , isn 'tit ? - I don 't believe it . - Well , if you don 't like the answers , you should avoid asking the questions . Look at them . They have no knowledge ofthe past , no ambition for the future , - Solucky , - Why would you say something like that ? Can you even imagine what it 's like to remember everything ? I remember a six-year-old girl who asked me about dinosaurs 800,000 years ago . I remember the last book I recommended : Look Homeward , Angel , by Thomas Wolfe . And yes , I even remember you , Time travel : practical application . How doyou know about the Morlocks if you can 't leave this place ? There was one Eloi who managed to escape , He told me everything , We spentyears together , just talking . The conversation 's a little spotty now , but I do remember . - It 's good to have a friend . - Then you can help us fiind the Morlocks , fiind Mara . And if the truth is so horrible , and will haunt your dreams for all time ? Well , I think I 'm used to that . My friend said he came from the east , from the jungle . - Will you describe it ? - I don 't have to . Just follow the breathing . In the dream , we 'removing to war dit , but I think it was meant to keep us away , - I might just go in by my self . - No . Mara would be very cross with me if you got hurt .

We weren 't always like this . After the moon fell from the sky , the Earth could no longer sustain the species . Some managed to stay above , The rest of us escaped underground , Then centuries later , when we triedtoreemerge into thesun again , we couldn 't , So we bred ourselves into castes . Some to be our eyes and ears . - Some to be our muscles and sinews . - You mean , your hunters . Yes . Bred to be predators , but bred also to be controlled . You see , my caste concentrated ... on expanding our cerebral abilities . - You control their thoughts . - Not just theirs . The Eloi . So it 's not enough that you hunt them down like animals . - That 's their role here . - To be your food ? Yes . And for those who are suitable , to be breeding vessels ... for our other colonies . Yousee , I 'm just one of many , I don 't understand how you can sit there and speak so coldly about this . Have you not considered the human cost of- - of what it is you 're doing ? We all pay a price ... Alexander . Don 't worry . You 're safe . I control them . With out that control , they would exhaust the food supply ... in a matter of months . Food supply ? They 're human beings ! Who are you ... to question 800,000 years ... of evolution ? - This is- - This is a perversion ofevery natural law . And what is time travel but your pathetic attempt to control the world around you , - your futile effort to have a question answered ? Do you think I don 't know you , Alexander ? I can look inside your memories , your nightmares , your dreams . You 're a man haunted by those two most terrible words : What if ? Look at you ! - And a long pony tail- - - Daddy ! - Who 's that ? Is it Daddy ? - Daddy ! - Long pony tail , And we 're still having lots of fun , - Right , Right Da-da ! Daddy . You built your time machine because of Emma 's death . If she had lived , it would never have existed . So how could you use your machine to go back to save her ? You are the inescapable result ... of your tragedy , just as I ... am the inescapable result ... ofyou . You haveyour answer . Now go . I believe you have something that belongs to me . - We all have our time machines , don 't we ? Those that take us back are memories ... and those that carry us forward , are dreams . - You 're forgetting one thing . - Huh ? - What if ? - What areyou doing with it ? - Changing the future . Come on . Wait . Wait here . Go . - Hurry ! Huh ? Alexander ! I 'm sorry you lostyour machine . Oh , it 's all right . It was only a machine . " " The congregation rose and stared , " " while the three dead boys camemarching up theaisle .. " " Tom in their lead , Joe next , " " and Huck , a ruin ofdrooping rags , - " " sneaking sheepishly in the rear . " " They had hid in an unused gallery , listening to their own funeral sermon . Aunt Polly , Mary and the Harpers threw themselves upon them- - " " This is the place . So it is . - But there 's nothing here . - Well , it was different then . My laboratory was all around here . The kitchen was up there where that tree is . Not that Mrs. Watchit ever let me go in there . I don 't know what to tell you , sir . He 's been gone this whole week . And you 've no idea where he went ? - No , sir . - This would be my green house , There was a garden outside . Gren ' tormar 'tas ? Yes . - I 'm glad . - Sir ? I 'm glad he 's gone . Maybe he 's fiinally found someplace where he can be happy . - This was my home . - His home . Long ago . You know , Molly and I were talking about engaging a housekeeper , someone to live with us and help take care of Jamie . Would you be interested ? - Perhapsjust until the master returns . - Of course . - But there 'd be some changes made . I run a tight house . Oh , I have no doubt ofthat . I 'll call by in the morning , and we 'll arrange it . - Good night , Mrs. Watchit . - Good night , Mr. Philby . - Godspeed , my fline lad . Godspeed . Subtitle by amcom

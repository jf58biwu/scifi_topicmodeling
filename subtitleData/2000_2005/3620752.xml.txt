 You gotta breathe , Kath . In and out . You 're panting . Can 't we just go home and start this again tomorrow ? You 're in safe hands now . - How are we doing ? - She 's getting ready . I 'll check on her dilation . If she 's close , we 'll call Dr Lev . - What is that sound ? - lt 's the baby 's heart monitor . What 's happening , Duffy ? Something 's happening . Nurse , get the team in for a C-section . - Why ? What 's wrong ? - Baby 's having some trouble , some distress . We 'll take care of it . We know what to do . You just lie back now . Sir , you 'll have to scrub if you 're going to be here . - Duffy ... - lt 's all right. I 'll be right back . Don 't wait for me . Please , don 't let anything happen to my baby . Just lie back now . Let us do our work . I can 't ... I can 't feel anything . - Something 's wrong , isn 't it ? - Lie down now , Mrs McCready . - Hit her again . - ls something wrong with my baby ? Your baby 's just fine . Let me see . What is it ? is it a boy ? Oh , my God ... Oh , my God , what is it ? - Duffy ! - Put her under . Agent Scully ... - Hi . - Hi . Sorry. I didn 't realize you had an appointment . This is Duffy Haskell . He says he knows you , or you know him . I 'm sorry , I don 't remember . I contacted you about my wife about eight years ago . Because she was an alien abductee . That was before my time here . But is there something I can help you with ? She 's dead . My wife is dead now . - They killed my wife . - l checked the files . Mr Haskell wrote several letters to Mulder describing his wife 's abduction experiences . My wife gave birth to an alien . - l thought you said your wife was murdered . - That 's the reason they did it . OK , Mr Haskell . Why don 't you start from the beginning ? Kath was a multiple abductee . The aliens did these procedures on her . Tests . One procedure would give her cancer , while another one would cure her . Stuff like that . For years , you see . Then this year , they came into our bedroom and implanted an alien embryo in Kath . I don 't suppose you have any medical proof of this ? I have an ultrasound . Anyone with a trained eye can see that is a bizarre pregnancy . Especially for a woman who was never able to conceive . - l doubt you 'd get the doctors to cop to that . - What doctors ? We 've been through three sets . They 're all in on it . They 're all in cahoots . So you 're saying that it was the doctors that killed your wife ? And stole the alien baby . That ultrasound is proof . Do you have all the information and numbers and a way that we can reach Mr Haskell ? - We 'll be in touch . - Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you , Agent Doggett. I 'm sure the rest of my afternoon can 't possibly be so amusing . - l thought you 'd find it interesting . - Interesting ? As in preposterous and outrageous ? Well , unless I 'm mistaken , you already knew that man 's story . The abduction , the tests , a bout with cancer then a remission . What exactly are you getting at ? That 's your story , Agent Scully . I 'd say right down to a T. I mean , except for the pregnancy . It 's all right there in the X-Files . I appreciate your thoroughness , Agent Doggett , and your familiarity with the X-Files cases in those cabinets . But my personal files are my personal files . OK ? Sure . Of course . - There you are. I 've been looking for you . - Hi . I 'm sorry. I had a doctor 's appointment and I guess time just got away from me . - ls anything the matter ? - Nothing . No , I just ... I went for a walk . Then what 's wrong ? I 'm ... I 'm sorry I haven 't told you . I don 't know why I haven 't . I mean , you were always there for me during my illness , but ... Don 't make me guess . I was left unable to conceive with whatever tests that they did on me . And I am not ready to accept that I will never have children . Scully , there 's something I haven 't told you either , and I hope you 'll forgive me and understand why I would have kept it from you . What ? During my investigation into your illness I found out why you were left barren . Your ova were taken from you and stored in a government lab . What ? You found them ? I took them directly to a specialist who would tell me if they were OK . - l don 't believe this . - You were deathly ill and I ... I couldn 't bear to give you another piece of bad news . is that what it was ? Bad news ? The doctor said the ova weren 't viable . I want a second opinion . Agent Scully ? What are you doing ? I don 't know . I guess I just forgot to push the button . I wasn 't clear on what you wanted to do about this guy Haskell . About his wife 's story . There 's nothing to do . Hello. ls anybody here ? What 's happening ? No , you don 't understand ! You 're scaring me . This is ... You 're scaring me . What 's happening ? - No . Listen to me . - Mrs Hendershot , please . - You don 't know ! - Stay calm . There are no similarities between your baby and the others. I know both cases . - You don 't know that . - Try to keep her calm . - l 'm going to get another doctor . - No , I 'm not staying here . Who are you ? What are you doing here ? - l 'm ... I 'm here with my friend . - You 're here with Ms Hendershot ? Yes. I 'm worried about her . Ms Hendershot is fine . But you 'll have to wait up front , please . You can 't be back here . - Parenti Medical Group . - l want to speak to Dr Parenti , please . This is his service . I can reach him if it 's an emergency . Yes , it is. lt 's Dana Scully . Dana ? What 's wrong ? I 'm afraid . - Tell me what it is . - l want you to look at something for me . - lt 's an ultrasound . - l 'm not in my office right now . Can you send it there ? I 'll look at it as soon as possible . - l want you to compare it to mine . - Dana ... Are you gonna be OK ? Yes . Fine. I 'm ... I 'm OK . All right , I 'll get back to you , Dana . OK . Thank you . Ms Scully ? Got a good report for you . I looked at the ova you gave me and consulted with my colleagues . We all feel that , with the proper approach , we might be successful . Got a good chance to get you pregnant . It 's too good to be true . I don 't want to lay odds , but it 's not out of the realm of possibility if we start soon . - We can start right away ? - You need a father , of course . I can get you genetic counseling on finding an anonymous donor , if you want . Unless you already have someone in mind . Yeah. I ... I just have to figure out how to ask him . Dana ? You wanna come on back ? What did you find ? I looked at this ultrasound you sent me . I don 't know what I 'm supposed to be seeing , but it looks fine . As does your ultrasound . - You didn 't see anything strange ? - Why do you ask that ? I just want to be sure . I 've had ... complications . It 's normal to be worried . OK . Thank you . Your only concern now is when you 're going to tell the fbi . Can 't keep it a secret forever , Dana . You 're going to start showing soon . OK , got it . Thanks . Agent Scully , I just got a call from a Dr Parenti 's office . About an ultrasound you left there this morning . Dr Parenti is my doctor . - Come on , Agent Scully . - You don 't believe me ? That ultrasound is the one Duffy Haskell left here . Dr Parenti is one of the doctors he consulted with during the course of that pregnancy . Excuse me , but are you investigating me ? I was checking on the Haskells before I dropped the case , like you asked me to do . I didn 't ask you to drop the case . I said there was nothing to do . If there 's nothing to do , why are you investigating ? - You are jumping to conclusions . - l 'm trying to do my job . Only it gets hard to do if the person you work with is keeping secrets and telling lies . I am not investigating these people , Agent Doggett . Parenti is my doctor . is that so strange ? - ls there something about him I don 't know ? - No . But Duffy Haskell is a piece of work , I 'll tell you that much . What am I being accused of ? What did you call me in here for ? You were gonna help me . As President of the Ohio Mutual UFO Network you sent Agent Mulder threatening letters which he passed on to me , Mr Haskell . It 's something of a habit with you , writing threatening letters . No one will believe me . You wrote a letter to a Dr Lev saying you would kill him if he hurt your wife . Dr Lev killed my wife . He stole the alien baby out of her womb . I can 't find any documentation that the two of you were even married , let alone any history or evidence of foul play . Dr Lev is a leader in the field of birth defects . His peers hold him in the highest regard . - Why would he ever kill your wife ? - That 's why I came to you . Mr Haskell , allegations aside , it 's a crime to threaten anyone . - You believe me , don 't you ? - We 're sorry for your loss . But if you persist in these threats and in disseminating these stories , we 'll have to enter your name into the federal system as a dangerous individual . I 'm alone now because of them . They took everything from me . And there are other women out there just like Kath . Zeus Genetics . Dr Lev speaking . They called me back to poke holes in my story . As we knew they would . - We still risk losing Hendershot . - Then it 's time to let her go . - Hi . - Hi . Come on in . - Can I take your coat ? - No , I can 't stay. I gotta get back to the office . Obviously you 've had time to think about my request . It 's ... lt 's not something that I get asked to do every day . But I am absolutely flattered . - No , honestly . - lf you 're trying to politely say no , it 's OK . I understand . See , as weird as this sounds - and this sounds really weird , I know - but I just wouldn 't want this to come between us . Yeah . No , I understand . I do . But ... the answer is yes . I 'll call Dr Parenti and I assume that he 'll want to meet you and go through the donor procedure . At that part , I 'm a pro . My name is Mary Hendershot . My baby 's in danger . So is yours . - Can I have some coffee , black , please ? - Sure . - Thanks for coming down here . - Yeah . - You going somewhere ? - Yes . Am I missing something here ? As Assistant Director , Agent Scully has come to me and asked to take a leave of absence . Great . - Can I ask why ? - No . So I 'm the X-Files now ? Just me ? Agent Scully isn 't quitting the fbi , she 's just going away . Thanks for getting me out of bed to give me the news . Drop me a line if you get a chance . - You gotta tell him , Scully . - l can 't . Agent Doggett ? I want you to understand . What is it you want me to understand , the secrets or the lies ? I told you , I 'm not doing anything behind your back . You 're supposed to watch my back , Agent Scully . If I was putting you at risk in any way , you can be sure that I wouldn 't let you down . I hope you know that . I only know what you tell me . I gotta go . - Who 's that in Agent Scully 's car ? - That I don 't know , Agent Doggett . - You 're Scully ? Agent Scully ? - Yes , Dana Scully . - This is Ms Hendershot . Mary Hendershot . - l 'm Dr Miryum . These are our best team of obstetricians . Tell them what you told me . Ms Hendershot believes she is carrying a baby that is not her own . That , by whatever means , at 40 weeks she is about to give birth to something inhuman . - She have medical records ? - l can 't trust my doctors . She believes - and with possible good reason - that her life may be in danger . That women just like her have been murdered in childbirth . Why ? It sounds insane . These doctors killed my friend because she was onto them , because she saw too much . You should know that I 'm notjust here as an fbi agent . Agent Scully is an MD . - So what is it she 's carrying ? - That 's why we 've come to you . - All right , let 's get her prepped and ready . - For what ? You 're going to have this baby . Our concern right now is you have it safely . Whatever it is in you we 'll know in a few hours if we induce labor immediately . - How did this woman find you ? - A man named Haskell led her to me . His pregnant wife is now dead . Dr Miryum ... She 's not the only woman whose life is in danger . Agent Farah . Didn 't see you in here , John . What you doing in the dark ? I 'm in the dark pretty much most of my time on the X-Files , Joe . Got a little something you may want to shine a light on . You had me run this guy Duffy Haskell 's prints . I hate to say , that case is closed now . It 's been closed since 1970 , when David Haskell , same prints , was buried in a Virginia cemetery . USMC honor guard ceremony . - You 're kidding . - l kid you not . - Looks like you got yourself a real spook . - Or a snake in the grass . How long will this take ? Probably somewhere between four and 12 hours . All my life I wanted children . But I 'm afraid of what 's growing in me . That it even happened . You mean getting pregnant ? I had a boyfriend . When I looked at the dates , there was no way . Now I 'm sure it was an abduction . I 'm sure of what 's inside of me . Agent Scully . We 're all set for you . - You ready for this ? - Yeah . At your stage , the fetus is only eight centimeters , but we should be able to get a pretty clear picture of its development . There it is . - You see it ? - Yeah . I see two legs , two arms and hands . I see what would appear to be a healthy baby at 14 weeks . - Are you sure ? - The picture doesn 't lie , Agent Scully . Hard to tell , but would you like to know the sex ? - l just want to be certain that it 's OK . - We could do an amnio . It 's a little early , but we could do it if that 's what you want . - Knowle , can I talk to you ? - What are you doing here ? You said you 'd get back to me about this Haskell fingerprint . I 've got a day job . The government gets suspicious if I work too fast . I can 't wait , Knowle. lt can 't wait . is it the same guy or not ? How about we take a walk ? - How 'd you hook up with this guy , anyway ? - The man was in my office , Knowle . Military records show he died in 1970 . What 's the story ? - Possible he 's intelligence . - Doing what ? Working for who ? - What did he want ? - Us to investigate the murder of his wife . He claims she was an alien abductee . Look , I don 't buy any of this crap . But if the guy 's cla , he wasn 'tjust in my office killing time . Why go to the trouble at all ? There must be documentation in our files of a conspiracy to hide the truth . About what , extraterrestrials ? Look , it 's not my work . It 's the woman I work with , an Agent Scully . John , there 's no conspiracy . You and I go back a long time . I 'll do anything I can for you . Just give me more time to find out who this Haskell guy is , OK ? By the end of the day . I know I don 't have to tell you , but take it easy now after the procedure . The baby 's at risk if the membrane were to rupture . I just wanna know . I 'm anxious about the results . We 're hoping Ms Hendershot will deliver in the next few hours . You 're our next priority . Ms Hendershot , you have to get up . I have to get you out of here . Agent Doggett , what is it ? Scully . You know where she is ? How to alert her ? - To what ? - l think she 's been misled . - We all have , by Haskell . - You think or you know ? I can 't get a straight answer on that , which leads me to believe this is a setup , that Haskell came to us with his story to get Agent Scully to go wherever she 's gone . I can tell you she 's in a safe place . A hospital . What hospital ? Look , this involves doctors . Doctors who may have killed pregnant women . A hospital could be the worst place in the world for her . Tell me where Scully is . - Walden-Freedman Army Hospital . - Phone security there . Tell them everything . Security . Can you do this ? We 've got two patients missing . I need you to follow us . I 'm a friend of John Doggett 's . - Who are you ? - That 's not important . Get in the car . Go . This woman could give birth at any minute . - You 're in good hands . They 're field medics . - Where are you taking us ? We 're going to get you to the closest hospital where we can make sure this kid is born safe . - You gonna make it ? - Yeah , I just ... just had a procedure . I shouldn 't even be on my feet . Who the hell is this ? Get off this road , now . Ms Hendershot ? - l think it 's coming . - We have to stop this car . Not until it 's safe . If you don 't stop this car you could be endangering her life . Stop the car . Just relax . - What are you doing ? - Making sure you don 't hurt yourself . - Let go of me . - lt 's for your own good . Who are you ? Ms Hendershot ... - Mary ! - Agent Scully ... We 're going to have to sedate you . No ! Get in the car . - Agent Doggett ? - Agent Scully . What are you doing here ? What am I doing back in this place ? Lie down . You 're not taking any more chances . - What happened to me ? - You 're OK . You 're fine . Your baby 's fine . But you 're very , very lucky . - What about Ms Hendershot ? - She 's resting fine too . - What about her baby ? - Six pounds , eight ounces . A boy . Oh , my God . They switched it . Agent Doggett , they switched it on her . - lt 's over , Agent Scully . - No , it 's not . We can prove this . We can 't prove anything . They say you overreacted to fears about Ms Hendershot 's pregnancy and your own . They showed me a tape of another woman 's womb . They say it 's your baby , just taped onto an old cassette . Then who were those men ? They acted off information that came from me . They say they saved your life . How can I question that , standing there ? It was all planned . You know that . From the moment that man walked into our office . We were used to get at Ms Hendershot 's baby . And now we are being used to cover it up . Oh , my God ... At least you 're OK . Why didn 't you tell me ? I was afraid . Afraid that they 'd use it against me , to take me off the X-Files so that I couldn 't find Mulder . I told you I 'd help you . I said we 'd find him . Scully ? I must have dozed off . I was waiting for you to get back . It didn 't take , did it ? I guess it was too much to hope for . It was my last chance . Never give up on a miracle .

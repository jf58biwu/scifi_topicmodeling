 You don 't know how much I hate my job on days like this , Jeb . If it were my choice ... I 'd be giving you a promotion . But with the economy the way it is ... Are you firing me ? You can hold your head up , Jeb . You 've done a good job here . I-I don 't believe this . I ... I thought this was just an evaluation . I 'm sorry . I really am . Be calm , people . Stay back . Everybody stay back . Just get back . Everybody stay back . Oh , my God , there 's someone in there ! Please , stay back ! Keep your distance . Jeb . Can I help you ? Jeb ? Hey . Jeb . What 's up ? Agent Reyes ? Yeah , hi . Uh ... uh , Monica Reyes . Frank Potter , New Orleans PD . Trying to quit the habit . Yeah , I tried to quit smoking myself once . I hated that damn gum . Well , anyway , you , uh , want to see the victims ? Well , on the phone , you said you had reason to believe the killings might be satanic ritual murders . Right . Let me show you . This is Jeb Dukes ' work area . I found this among his personal effects . What can you tell me about the killer , Detective ? Anything ? 31 years old , college grad , lived alone . There 's some who felt he had a dark side , which could explain that there . Can I look in there ? Sure . You 're the expert . Does it tell you anything about why he might 've killed those people ? The fact is , a killer like this is usually pushed over the edge by what we call a stressor- - a catalyzing event- - an emotional breakdown , the breakup of a relationship , or sometimes when someone 's been fired . This guy was fired by the two victims . Well , that 's most likely what drove him to murder . Yeah , but what about all these images , these devil pictures ? It 's Marilyn Manson . Marilyn Manson ? Your kids listen to him . They probably buy his CDs at K-Mart . I don 't think there 's anything satanic going on here , Detective . Agent Reyes ? Okay , okay , it 's some rock group . But you don 't think this has anything to do with Satan or evil or ... ? Personally ... I 'd look into his gum . Agent Reyes ? Did you find something ? - Mulder ? - What ? I was just about to jump in the shower , but I was waiting for the pizza man . You got something going on with the pizza man I should know about ? The pizza man ? Well , correct me if I 'm wrong , but you just said you were waiting for the pizza man to jump in the shower . No , what I mean was , the pizza man 's usually late , and so ... You want to come in ? Thank you . I feel like I 'm stuck in an episode of Mad About You . Well , uh , yeah , but small technicality . Mad About You was about a married couple , and we just work together . Yeah , well , you know what I 'm talking about . I do , I do . What-what I 'm trying to say is that , uh ... we have no good reliable information on this man . I mean , what I am saying is , the pizza man ... is not above suspicion . Ah , I see . Is that for me ? - Yeah . - Nice package . Thank you . What 's the occasion ? Oh . Uh , I was going through some stuff after my mother died , and , um , it 's just an old family keepsake , and I wanted you to have it . Well , I 'm touched . Little Caesar , I presume ? Hi . Just , uh , give it to the man with the funny look on his face . Yeah , it 's $ 29.08 . $ 29.08 ? What 'd she get on it , a tank of gas ? Scully ? Scully ! Call 911 . That Scully ? Dana ? She 's got what ? Abdominal pains ? Her doctor is Dr. Speake . Oh , he 's been called . She . Who are you ? - The husband ? - No . Then you wait outside . Agent Mulder , what happened ? How 'd you find out ? I was dropping something off ; the landlord told me . Are you the husband ? Me ? No . Excuse me . Mulder . Special Agent Fox Mulder ? Speaking . Agent Mulder , my name is Monica Reyes . We never met . Not since you 've been alive , I should say . Who ? Special Agent Reyes . I know this is out of the blue , but I have a case I need your help on . It involves a certain phenomena . I can 't help you , Agent Reyes , for so many reasons . I think you should contact Agent Doggett at the X Files . I can 't call Agent Doggett because it involves him . I 'm in New Orleans , but I can be in D.C. in a few hours . It 's important , Agent Mulder . Very . Call me when you get here . They 're telling us not to worry . They 're running some tests . Agent Mulder . Agent Reyes ? You 're taller than I thought . You keep on alluding to a time that we 've met , and I don 't remember . I was there when they found you in the woods . You were ... uh ... Yeah , I 'm not surprised you don 't remember . Yeah . Um , I-I have somewhere I have to be , if we could cut to the chase . As I said before , it involves Agent Doggett , the death of his son . I don 't know if you 're familiar at all with that case . No , I 'm not at all familiar with Agent Doggett . I-I wasn 't aware of this . You were the lead investigator ? Once it fell to the FBI . Agent Doggett was with the NYPD at the time . We worked it together . We never caught the killer . It was the hardest case I 've ever had . As in " stealing into the bathroom to cry my eyes out " kind of hard . I can 't begin to imagine what it was like for John . I couldn 't bear to put him through this again , but if it means we could catch his son 's killer ... I just can 't go to him until I know if what I saw means anything . You said this case involves some kind of phenomena ? I don 't know if it was a psychic experience or what , but when we found his son , I had a vision . It was as if , for just a moment the body was changed . Changed ? Into what ? Ashes . It looked like ashes . The thing of it is , Agent Doggett told me he saw it , too . Although he spent the last few years convincing himself he didn 't- - that even if he did , it didn 't mean anything . What do you think it means ? I can 't shake the feeling that it 's a clue , that it could somehow point to who 's responsible if only I let it . And now I 've seen it again- - a thousand miles from here , a seemingly unrelated case- - and I 've had the same vision . There has to be a reason for it , a reason it 's happening now . Sir , immediate family only . You fellas just don 't listen . You have to go now . Hey ! Hey ! - You stay out of my life ! - Take it easy ! - Stay out of my business ! - Take it easy , Agent Doggett ! You want to get something on me , you ask for it ! I don 't want to get calls about you going behind my back ! You got that straight ? ! I don 't want anything on you ! I was asked to look into this file . Who asked you ? ! Agent Doggett . What are you doing ? Is this you ? Is this you looking into this ? Yes . - I asked Agent Mulder . - You asked him what ? There 's nothing in there for him to bother with ! Why don 't you just calm down , Agent Doggett , and let her explain the connection to you . The connection ? To what ? I was going to tell you , John . I was in New Orleans on a case- - a shooting . Something that I saw connected back to Luke . A vision . Not this again . You 're not going to make something out of nothing . Bob Harvey . Does that name mean something or nothing to you ? Bob Harvey was a suspect in the death of my son . We questioned him , but then we realized he wasn 't our man . Agent Mulder pointed it out . Bob Harvey was killed last night in a car crash , fleeing the police near a shooting in New Orleans . He died in front of the building where the shooting occurred . What 's the connection ? That 's it . That 's it ? And then there was the vision . No , there 's no connection . I don 't care what you saw , you leave it alone . And you leave it the hell alone . I know there is something here . Good . Hi . Hi . Is your mommy home ? Mom ! Mia ? Katha Dukes ? Yeah . Sorry about the late hour . My name is Monica Reyes . I 'm with the FBI . I believe that we 're all born good , uncorrupted , and life itself does the corrupting . But , you know , someone like Jeb ... he just isn 't capable of this . Are you close to your brother ? Very . Jeb lived here in the house with us till he went down South . He loves his niece . Does the name Bob Harvey mean anything to you ? Did Jeb ever have any dealings with him ? No . I think I 'd know . Why ? No reason . It 's the answer I was kind of expecting , actually . Hello ? Katha ? Yes ? Katha , it 's Jeb . I really can 't talk right now . It 's been a very bad day here . Listen , it wasn 't me that killed those people , all right ? It was somebody else . I 'm telling you , it was somebody else . You 're going to have to call back later . Hi . I 'm sorry to bother you . I got a flat tire back a ways . What are you doing , Agent Doggett ? I was , um ... I just came by to see how you 're doing . I 'm , uh ... I feel all druggy . Do you mind ? Thank you . They say you 're stabilized , but we 've been worried about you . Who 's " we " ? You know ... me and Agent Mulder and ... What 's wrong , Agent Doggett ? You don 't seem too good yourself . You worked with Agent Mulder for how long ? A long time . Mm . You never believed in any of this stuff , this paranormal or whatever you call it . So what changed your mind ? I realized it was me . That I was afraid . Afraid to believe . Why do you ask ? Agent Doggett , why do you ask ? Some other time . Agent Mulder ? I was looking for Agent Doggett . Well , that 'd make sense . It 's not my office anymore . But old habits die hard . What are those ? Cases involving images like you described . People close to crimes who experience visions of death disassociated from reality . And what did you find ? Absolutely nothing . These visions are so random as to have absolutely no significance to the cases they 're supposed to pertain to . You 're wrong . I think I know these files . And I know what I saw . There 's a reason these things are happening . There is something at work here , and it all began with the man killed in the car crash- - Bob Harvey . I think that 's a coincidence . I think that life is full of them . And full of patterns- - things we see , but can 't comprehend . You believe that . Why can 't you believe this ? I think there 's an opening coming up in this office soon . You might want to apply . Is that why you won 't help him ? I have a , uh , sick friend in the hospital , and , uh , I think I should go see her . I hope she gets well . This office down here needs at least one person with an open mind . You 'll say anything , won 't you ? Only when I think I 'm right . What am I doing here ? Been asking myself that same question , Agent Doggett . But it seems the tenacious Agent Reyes does not want to let go of this one . Of what ? She 's got a murder victim out here , a woman found shot . She thinks it 's by the same man who killed those two people down in New Orleans- - this Jeb Dukes . What does she want from me ? She wants to know if you see it , too , what she 's been seeing . I told you , there 's no connection . Agent Doggett . I 'm sorry , Agent Reyes . I don 't see it . I think you do . You 're just afraid to go there . Whew . Man , you just keep shooting till you hit something , don 't you ? You 'd rather blind yourself to the connections , but I can 't . You keep talking about these connections . Connections to what ? To who ? What if this is a thread of evil connecting through time , through men , through opportunity , connecting back to you . In India , in Africa , in Iran , in the Middle East , in the Far East , most of the world , they take it as a given . They see evil in death the way other people see God in a rose . I saw Elvis in a potato chip once . You know what I 'm talking about . Yes , I do . I do . But if this man doesn 't see it , he doesn 't see it , right ? You awake ? Yeah . What did the doctor say ? That I had a partial abruption . Which means that my placenta started to tear away from the uterine wall . They 're going to need to monitor me for awhile . But you 're going to be fine ? Yeah . Where have you been ? I 've actually been out in the field with Agent Doggett and this , um , female agent from New Orleans . Agent Reyes . Yeah . I like her . You 're nothing at all alike . Well , then neither are you and I. So this is a case you 're working on ? Yeah . Actually , one that involves Agent Doggett 's son , the son who died . Yeah , he 's never talked to me about him , but I know something . Are you able to help him at all ? You can 't help a man who can 't help himself . He 's worth the effort , Mulder . All right , you got a half an hour to play in your room before Mommy has dinner ready . Mia ? Okay . What are you doing here ? I 'm coming home . The FBI was here , Jeb . I didn 't do what they said , Kath . It wasn 't me , okay ? It wasn 't . What is that on your face ? What ? Is that blood ? I don 't know how that got there . I need the truth , Jeb . Look , please , believe me , Katha , it 's not me . Okay ? I need help . Please . Mom ? Is that Uncle Jeb ? Yeah , sweetheart . Yeah , it is . It 's me . Jeb Dukes , middle name Larold . No , Larold . Okay , thanks , anyway . What are you doing , John ? I 'm looking into this case . You 're looking in the wrong way . There are a hundred agents in this building who can phone canvass . Ah , but there 's only two who can solve crimes with mental telepathy- - you and me . So we 'll just read the tea leaves on this one , and there it is , right ? - Case closed ? - John ... Damn it , Monica , you want to find this guy , I 'm trying to find him . What do you want from me ? I want you to be honest with yourself about what you saw that day . Honest about what your feelings tell you . Feelings don 't solve crimes . What the hell does it matter what my feelings are ? How the hell 's that going to get the job done ? I 'm not talking about the job , John . What are you scared of ? Why does it scare you ? I got to believe that I did everything I could to find my son . You did do everything to find your son . I got to believe that I did everything I could to save him . To get him back safe , to not let him down . I got to believe that I did everything humanly possible , 'cause if I can 't believe that , then these other possibilities that you talk about , that Mulder talks about , that Agent Scully talks about , if they 're real ... if they 're real , then ... that 's something else I could 've done to save my son . Monica Reyes . Katha ? Katha , wait . Jeb Dukes ' sister . He 's there at the house with her . This guy somehow has some link to my son , and I 'm damn sure going to find out what it is . " As it happened , Hansel and Gretel " had overheard everything that their parents had said . " ' Shh , ' said the boy . " ' I 'll find a way out , I promise you , and when at ... ' " Mia , honey ? Can you come here a minute , please ? But Uncle Jeb 's reading to me . That 's okay , I just need you a minute . Can you ... can you just come here ? Who 's here ? She just wants to talk , Jeb . I just want you to tell her what you told me ; she can help you . Who ? I said who , damn it ! Come on , baby . - Uncle Jeb ! - You lied to me ! - Come on , Jeb . - Just get back . Mommy ! Go ! Mommy ! Mommy ! Let me go , Uncle Jeb ! Mommy , help ! Let me go ! Let me go ! Help ! Right there , right there ! Hands in the air ! Federal agent ! I 'm armed , I 'll shoot ! - You drop the gun , you drop the gun ! - Let go of the girl ! - Mommy ! - I 'll shoot her , I swear ! I just need to talk to you . Mommy . Mommy ! Mommy ! I won 't hurt you . - You stay back . - Mommy ! Mommy ! I said stay back ! Mommy ! Mommy ! Mia ! Mia ! What have you done ? ! This man needs help ! You 're not going to die on me now . Agent Doggett ... You hear me ? You 're going to make it . You 're going to make it . You hear me ? John ... No , no , the parade stops here . Now , if you want to save him , let the doctors do their work , okay ? Who 's the immediate family member here ? I am . Okay , come with me . I 'm going to need you to fill out some information for me , all right ? There is nothing more you can do . You can 't tell me that now . Maybe saving this girl was the reason . Maybe that 's what this was all about . Maybe that 's what I saw and why I saw it . For that kid . Go home , John . There 's nothing here for you to do . Agent Doggett . She just fell back to sleep . I just wanted to check and see how she 's doing . Anyways , I 'm here with this other thing . We , uh , we caught this killer , Jeb Dukes . He 's in the ICU . He may not make it . And now you 're wondering if there really was a connection . You know , when I , uh ... I first came to work at the FBI , I worked at Violent Crimes . And I saw ... I saw the worst of humanity . I saw monsters . And I wondered how they became that way , how these men became so evil . I know there were psychological explanations- - victims of their environment , victims of their parents- - but the scientific explanations were never truly satisfying , and I began to think about evil like a disease . You know , that it goes from man to man or age to age . Most of us walk around thinking that we 're incapable of any acts of evil , and we are . You know , we can stifle that momentary urge to kill or to hurt . We have some kind of immunity to it , but I think it 's possible that there 's an occurrence in somebody 's life , a tragedy or a loss , that leaves them vulnerable , hurts their immunity to evil . And all of a sudden , at that point in their lives when they 're weakened , they 're open to evil , and they can become evil . If that were true , then what you 're saying is-is ... this man we wheeled in here tonight is infected with evil . Same evil that killed my son . You really believe that , Agent Mulder ? Uh , I 'm not really a good test for questions like that . I 'll believe almost anything , you know ? But the , uh ... the pisser is you may never know . It may be like Agent Reyes says . It could be random and meaningless- - who it affects , who it goes to . What if it isn 't ? Well , then you 'd be seeing something that I don 't , Agent Doggett . Somebody ! Doctor ! Let 's go . Jeb ! Push one gram of epi . Right here . Call it . I 'm sorry . Time of death : 10 : 57 p.m. No , no , no . You killed him . Drop the weapon ! No ! Drop it ! I need a doctor ! Oh , my Lord . I need a doctor stat . It 's over . It 's over now . It 's never over . Mulder , you never fail to surprise me . I just wish I felt like eating it right now . That 's cool . We can just wait for the cheese to congeal and eat it later . You miss your regular pizza man , don 't you ? Yes . That 's okay . He 's coming by later . Bet you forgot about that , didn 't you ? No , I didn 't , actually . Thought about it a lot while I was lying in my hospital bed , wondering what on earth you could have given me . And ? Oh , my God . Oh , Mulder . Is it what you imagined ? Not even close . Oh , my , that 's the wrong doll , actually . But then , that 's the other gift that you gave me , Mulder . Courage ... to believe . I hope that 's a gift I can pass on . I made this !

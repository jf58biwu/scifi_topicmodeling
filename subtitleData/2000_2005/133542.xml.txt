 Daddy ... Three years have passed ... The world has entered into a new age of terror . Shuya Nanahara , leader of the anit-BR group , Wild Seven , is on the international wanted list as a terrorist . The adults who were afraid of retalliation from children started a new game in the name of justice . The Anti-Terror Special Law of the New Century [ commonly know as BRIl ] The game has begun . We ... Will never forgive the adults who made us kill each other in the past . Rise with us . And fight together with us . Today ... We declare war on all adults . Three years ago , my father , a teacher , was shot to death by a student he 'd taught . In the center of his last portrait , he painted , was a girl . When I learned the girl wasrt me , I stopped going to school . Wanted Nationally And , now that I 've come to terms with my sentiments toward my father ... I 've decided to participate in the game . BR II Survival Program : Thank you for your registration . I was transferred to Shika-no-Toride Junior High a boarding school solely consisting of dropouts and delinquents from around the country . We were all children abandoned by the grown-ups . Pathetic ! No one knows what tomorrow will bring . The only thing that felt real for me , was the pain I felt right there , right then . And this teacher was one transferred here . Partners ... Shintaro Here , Takuma . No thanks . Why not ? Write something . It 's to commemorate our graduation . It ain 't over yet . Hey . Hey ! Nao , you write . Shintaro ! Hey ! What is this ? Where are we ? Hello , to the 10 million BR law supporters across the nation . Look at this , the bus has arrived in the middle of the heavy security area . The Senior Class Homeroom B of Shika-no-Toride Junior High was carefully selected for this . Don 't push me ! Stop pushing me ! Look at them , everyone , this is a class of drop-outs selected from around the nation . They will be the first challengers since the revision of the BR law . While the world is watching , what will be the outcome of the game this time ? Our sponsors have been generous enough to provide them with the watches and the gear . Tune in and watch the passionate lives and deaths of 42 adolescents ! Be seated ! Be seated ! Teacher ? Teacher ! Teacher , please . Merry Christmas ! I 'm Riki Takeuchi , newly assigned to your homeroom . Now , everyone ... I 'm sure you understand fully what the situation you 're in now is about . We don 't understand at all ! Please explain it to us ! Teacher , this collar 's choking me . Japan ... China ... North Korea ... What the hell 's that ? Doesrt make any sense . Let 's go home . Move ! Out of the way ! Russia . Open up ! Cambodia ... Grenada ... Lybia ... El Salvador ... Iraq ... Somalia ... Bosnia ... Sudan ... Yugoslavia ... And Afghanistan ... Do you know what these countries have in common ? These are the countries bombed by the U.S. In the last 60 years . No less than 22 countries , approximately 8 million casualties . It 's a lie that everyone in the world is equal . Human life is not at all equal at all ! Last Christmas ... It 's been a year since that merciless terrorist attack hit us . The terrorists who took away many lives in the blink of an eye now hide away on Battleship Island far away over the ocean . Terrorist leader Shinya Nanahara said the following while claiming responsibility for his crimes ... " We declare war on all adults ! " That 's quite alright . By the way , in our country an adult is grown-up of age 20 or over . Everyone else is a child . Have you ever considered how much money it takes to raisea child into an independent adult ? Huh ? What d 'ya want from us ? What ? Keep your weapon tucked away for safety , will you ? It costs an average of 30 to 40 million to raise a child . That 's the price of each of your lives right now . It 's awfully expensive , and our poor nation can no longer afford to raise unfit children like you . That 's why , after consulting with important people we the adults have decided not to accept the declaration of war . If you want so much to fight a war , please go ahead and do it among yourselves ! That 's all , and thank you for waiting , here 's BR II ! Let 's have you engage in a war today . BR II is a complete new war game that is based on the BR laws . Rules are simple ... You 'll win if you locate and kill the evil leader Shuya Nanahara camping on the island . The time limit is 3 days . Understand so far ? Alright ! Look at the white line at your feet . In life there are only two types of people ; the winners and the losers . Those who dare to cross the line are the brave ones on their way to be the winners . This side if you 're in , this side if you 're out . The losers are evil . This line separates the just from the evil . It 's either black or white , and no more . Now , it 's time for the roll call . Boys # 1 Mr. Takuma Aoi , Girls # 1 Miss Nao Asakura . Nao ... Are you with the winners , or the losers ? The losers will be terminated since we have no use for them . Here we go ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ! One moment please . Girls # 4 Miss Shiori Kitano , you 're in , aren 't you ? Yes . A Christmas present for the brave girl ! Shiori ? - Shiori , wait . Now , let me ask the first two again . Winners or losers ? Here we go : 3,2,1 . You want me to go , I 'll go ! Taku ! - Taku , what are you doing ? Shut up ! Just one thing , I don 't trust adults a bit . I 'm never gonna do what you want me to ! Is that so ? Taku ! - Nao ! Nao ! - Hey ! Okay , next . Boys # 2 Mr. Shugo Urabe , Girls # 2 Miss Miki Ikeda . Let 's go now . 3,2,1 . Fuckir bastard ! Do you know what the hell you 're doing ?

Girls # 14 Miss Ryoko something . Boys # 15 Mr. Shintaro Makimura . Girls # 15 Miss Kazumi Fukuda . I 'm not doing it . Huh ? I 'll never accept this . Shintaro . Loser . Sorry , I 'm going ahead . Go if you want . What the hell are you all doing ? Don 't you think it 's crazy ? Why the hell should we go to war ? Are you sure , Shintaro ? You 'll die . 3 , 2 , 1 . Okay , I see . Don 't ! What were you thinking ? Hey ! Get over here now ! Hurry ! Come on ! I 'm not doing it . Think twice , Shintaro . You 've been a loser in enough situations already . This is your last chance . I 'm not done yet ! Here we go . 3 ... 2 ... 1 We are partners . Shintaro ! Why ? Why , Shintaro ? What were you doing ? We 're partners , aren 't we ? Stop foolir around . Stop ... Stop foolir around , Shintaro ! Boys # 15 Shintaro Makimura - dead ( 41 students remaining ) Me ? Kazumi ? Ah , I 'm sorry , I forgot . The new game is a tag match . Kazumi , your number is 15 just like Shintaro 's , right ? Well , the collar that each of you are wearing right now is connected to that of the person with the same roll number as yours . When one person dies , the other will go off automatically , it goes " boom ! " It explodes . Hey ! What 's wrong with all of you ? For real ? For real . Hey ! Hey ! Are you really dead ? Hey ! Listen up , everyone ! It would also explode if the pair of you move more than 50 meters apart from each other . So , everyone be careful . What 's going on ? What 's up with this ? This collar , the collar ... Mommy ! Girls # 15 Kazumi Fukuda - dead ( 40 students remaining ) Next . Boys # 16 ... Shintaro ! No ! Excellent . The remaining 40 students all participating . So any questions ? Kurosawa . So what I have to do is to kill Shuya Nagahara , is that right ? That 's right . Do you understand what you 're saying ? What is there to understand ? Nagahara is a murderer . Can we really go home if we do it ? I 'll do it . We 'll kill Nagahara and survive ! Excuse me , Teacher ... Yes , Miss Nigumi . Can I take a shower everyday ? What are you talking about ? Because I have atopy ... Teacher ! In the order of attendence , we 're both girls . Isn 't that unfair ? Please , at least , let us choose our partners . You seem to be missing the point . This ... and that ... This is war ... Then ... What is war ? Mr. Kitano . When can we get weapons ? You 'll get guns when you leave the tent but get bullets when you arrive on the island . Who knows if you 're gonna shoot us if we arm you now . Listen up ! Your enemy is an evil terrorist who killed civilians . No sympathy is necessary . Just kill and kill as many as you can . As a representative of all adults , I hope you 'll do a good job . Never lose ! That 's all . The first day of the game Dec. 23 , 6 : 00 AM Mission 1 : Landing Attention , all . Attention , all . Present time is 0600 . Begin operations . Everyone look at the navigator and check the map . The enemy is hiding in his fortress on the hill . You 'll go in at Point Three . What 's that ? We divided the island into several sections in the map . At every hour a new off-limit section will be designated . If you remain in the previous section at that time , your collar will be set off so immediately go outside of it . The boat 's operation mode will now switch from automatic to manual . Prepare to land immediately . Stop it . No ! Help me ! Help me ! I can 't see ! No ! Help me !

All signals gone from the screen . Hacking ? What 's going on ? We 're verifying it right now . We detect an electromagnetic frequency . An electro-magnetic frequency ? The second day Dec. 24 , 0 : 40AM Shuya Nanahara ? What are you gonna do with us ? Wanna pick up where we left off ? That 's enough . Hey , you come over here . Don 't move or it 'll explode . Answer me . What are you gonna do with us ? Wearing such uniforms ... What did you come to this island for ? You call that fighting ? What are you implying ? Do you know what this gurs called ? AK47 ... Altmot Karashnikov ... The symbol of resistance used by guerillas around the world . This girl and I survived the game three years ago . We escaped from this island and traveled to a certain country where a war had been going on for 20 years . 4 million overflowing refugees . Severe inflation . Scars of air raids that wouldn 't go away . Life in that place was nothing like I 'd imagined . But ... No matter how harsh life could be there were smiles of the people living with pride . There were the smiles of innocent children . And then I came back to this country . I chose the way to fight with this gun . So what ? That 's got nothing to do with us . What are you fighting for right now ? Listen , this game will be over once you kill me . But when it 's over , do you think you can go back to living like you used to ? Then , what are you fighting for yourself ? They all died because of you guys ! There 's no words of compensation . We 'll keep on fighting . Even if all the adults in the world turn against us . Until the day comes when we can smile innocently just like those children I saw in that country . Shuya , the main guys are here . It 's a special unit . Let 's go . We 're all survivors of the game here or those who lost families . We 're not your enemy . Let 's go . You , too . Brother ! Taku ! Hide . I didn 't understand what you just said . But tell me what 's it like to kill others just to survive ? How did you feel when only you survived ? When you point your gun at someone , you better shoot . That 's what it means to survive . Yuma . Yuma ? Step back ! Headquarters ! This is lilbia . It appears the students have joined the terrorists . Everyone 's been shot . Send in support immediately . Right away ! Teacher . Teacher ? Shit ! I won 't let those brats do me in ! You got me , damn it . I 've got a family , too . The third day December 25 The rain keeps falling . Masami . Hold on , Masami . For some time , the moaning of the dying was the only sound that kept ringing in our ears . Everybody should eat something too . Get some energy . Thank you . How can you eat while someone 's dying ? I 'll never be a member of a group of terrorists . Kyoko ... I 'm sorry . Megumi ! Are you okay ? Taku ! Taku ! Hey , Taku ! What 's wrong ? Hard to breathe ? I 'm just a little hungry . Are you all right ? That 's enough . Just leave me alone . Take it . Good ... It 's delicious ... Saki , sister , it 's me . I 've been looking for you . I never expected to see you here . Since then , my father 's been caught and killed . I 've been fighting against the BR law . No one left except you and me . I 'm not the one you 're looking for . What are you talking about , Sis ? After I survived the game ... I wasrt gonna go back to home . I 've killed a lot of people . Lovers and even your best friend . I forgot everyone . Haruya ... Hello ? Hello ? Hello . What are you doing ? Don 't I always ask you to knock ? You stink . Don 't come in here . You know it 's your birthday today , isn 't it ? I thought we could go out for dinner with mom . Unbelievable . What ? My birthday was yesterday . It 's today , isn 't it ? It was yesterday . It 's okay , so please get out . Hey , Shiori ... Anything else ? What ? I should really do this , shouldn 't I ? What an idiot . What people are afraid of the most is probably not dying , but being forgotten . We 're here right now . We just wanted to let someone know that . It 's alright . It 'll be alright . Your short temper is not an illness . Stay in this school for a while , make friends with others , and I 'm sure you 'll be well . Everyone here 's like you . I promise I 'll come and get you . Excuse me , please start the car now . We 're all going to disappear some day , you know . Families ... friends ... But I 'll stay right by your side . I can 't do anything for you , but I 'll stay by your side forever . I promise . Nobu ... Kawada ... Everyone ... I 'm not doing anything wrong , am I ? I 'm fighting as good as you can , aren 't I ? Run ! Quick ! Run away now ! We still have something to do . Daddy ... What are you doing ? Stop ! Shit . Killing one or two of them won 't change a thing in this country . But we know all that . So far the way that you guys are going . I 'm sure that your stars are shining in the place where you want them to . It was good to meet you guys . I 'll go with you . Help me up . So ... let 's go . Yes . You guys stay alive . And never look back ! Mr. Mimura ! Hello . Hello . Old man ? Shiori . Listen . You have to prepare yourself when you hate someone . Masami ! Masami ? Sagisawa ! Sagisawa ! Hey ! I 'm sorry , Sugisawa ... I ... I ... Live . Live , everyone . Don 't forget me . Don 't ... forget ... Masami ! - Masami ! No ! Girls # 6 Masami Sagisawa - dead ( 10 remaining ) Another one of our partners died . What should we do from now ? Answer me . I don 't have the answer . Find it yourself . Shuya ! Shuya ! Taku ! There never was a place for us to go from the beginning . I knew that from the start . There 's no home to return to ! This is what war is , isn 't it ? You 're all fighting with all your strength , right ? And whenever someone dies , you just light another candle ! You even let little children die . You 're no different . You 're no different from the adults ! How I wish this war would end soon . I 've been thinking all along ... What can I do to make it up to the ones who died ? I don 't know how . But we all grew up before we even know it . The only thing the survivors like us can do is to never forget the ones who died . To keep remembering them , even when we grow up . Maki ... Let 's start . Okay . How much blood has been shed now ? How many tears ? Our many friends who fought with us , have all been killed in the past three years . But just as justice will never die we the so-called evil terrorists will never die out . We know ... that a handful of adults ... a handful of nations make decisions about what peace and freedom should be like for the rest of the world . But the world we live in is in no way unified . There are 6.3 billion people leading ordinary lives ... 6.3 billion ways to live ... 6.3 billion ways of peace ... 6.3 billion ways of justice ... 6.3 billion ways of war and evil . There 's never been any kind of peace won without war . Peace always carries the stains of blood , sweat and tears behind it . It 's being sent to all the host computers around the world . If we were to turn our eyes away from history , and forget then the peace we 'd have is just dog shit . Dog shit , is it ? Japan ... China ... North Korea ... Guatemala ... Indonesia ... Cuba ... Congo ... Peru ... Laos ... Vietnam ... Cambodia ... Grenada ... Lybia ... El Salvador ... Nicaragua ... Panama ... Iraq ... Somalia ... Where 's Taku ? Bosnia ... Sudan ... Yugoslavia ... Afghanistan and children all over the world fighting on their own . You may be alone , but let 's not fear aloneness . All the world 's children who have been abandoned , rise with us , and fight with us . We 'll throw out our old shoes , and begin running toward a place far beyond where we are . To the adults who took freedom from us and suppressed us ... I 'm sending message to all of them tonight . Merry Christmas , from Shuya Nanahara of the Wild Seven . Take everyone to a safe place ! Watch out ! Are you alright ? Please take care of this baby , and the rest of the children . Where did that come from ? We 're verifying it right now . What 's their position ? Teacher , a phone call for you . Who the hell 's calling at such time ? Well , it 's the prime minister . Put him on . Hello , Teacher . What a mess ! Where do you think I 've just gotten back from ? This time we 've really upset that country . The president just called me . He said he was going to launch an all-out attack 12 hours from now . What 's up with your homeroom students ? It 's all because you 're moving so slow ! We have no choice , I don 't care if 5 or 10 of your students die . We 'll be flexible . Use missiles and blow up the island and everybody along with it . Are you sure about that ? I 'm surprised . I thought you were an adult who 'd crossed over . You understand , there are only two types of people in this world : Winners and losers . Which one are you ? Are you going to fight with that country for justice and freedom ? Or ... Shut your mouth , you fuckir murderer ! What ? Once that country likened you to a 12-year-old boy . And how old is that country now , huh ? They don 't hesitate a bit to drop bombs on any country that upsets them . Is that how an adult should act ? Listen , the world is now unified around that country . Who decided that it is ? Well , why are you here ? I see . I had counted on you , and it 's too bad . With the power and authority as the prime minister of Japan I command you to immediately prepare to attack . Before they shoot missiles into us ... all terrorists and Shuya Nanahara , should be eliminated . Stand straight . Salute ! Taku ! Taku ? Taku . Taku . Takuma . Kuze , are you alright ? I can 't really move . But we have to get back . Nao will be worried about you . You 're hurt . Don 't try to talk so much . Ironic , isn 't it ? What is ? I 've always wanted to talk with you alone . Well , my wish finally comes true and I 'm like this . Did you know ... I 've been watching you ? If we could switch places would you want to be with me ? Of course . Then ... Promise me with your fingers . I had thought ... I didn 't care if I died . But ... But now I I don 't wanna die . Kuze ... Kuze ! Girls # 5 Haruka Kuze - dead ( 9 remaining ) Taku ! Takuma ! You were okay ? We worried about you ! No ... Haruka ! Burn her with them . You want some ? No thanks . It 'll be daybreak soon . The war with the adults will begin . During the half year while we camped on this island we 've found an underground tunnel . You might be able to reach the mainland if you follow it . Take the children and escape from here . What about you ? We 'll stay here and distract the enemy . This isn 't a place for you guys . The real trial for you begins now . To live life to its fullest is hundreds of times more difficult than to die . The last morning December 26 , 5 : 40 AM This is Sakai at Point B. All in position . This is Yone at Point C. We 're ready . Shuya , I 'll stay here , and fight with you . Jin , give me your gun . This is the AK47 Mr. Mimura gave me . You know well how valuable this gun is to me . I 'll leave this with you . Protect everyone . Shuya . You may often lose your way as you go on . But no matter what happens , don 't ever give up . This is farewell . Sis ... I promise ... I 'll never forget aboutyou . What 's the matter ? You go on along , too . I 'm staying here to see it through to the end . All of it . Let them get closer to us . Not yet . Let them come in much closer . Not yet ... Not yet ... Fire ! Kazama ! Kazama ! Kazama ! Everyone , hold on ! Buy more time ! Taku , what 's the matter ? Y 'know ... I don 't understand anything complicated and don 't wanna think about it , either . But if I run away now ... I feel I 'd lose something valuable . You wanna go back , don 'tyou ? I can 't go back . I made a promise to Shuya . I ... And I ... what should I do ? Make your own decision . I 'm coming . Kyoko ! I 've always liked you ! Go and do your best . Yes ! I 'm sorry to give you trouble all the time . I 'll see you later , right ? Of course , you will . I 'll go look for an answer . Maedo ! You fools , what are you doing here ? We 're partners ! Shibaki ! Don 't worry about me . I 've been happy to have had partners . Now , go on along . Shibaki ! Get back inside , c 'mon ! C 'mon ! Taku ... Say good bye to Kyoko for me . Osamu ! Hey , c 'mon now ! Boys # 3 Osamu Kasai , # 6 Masami Shibaki - dead ( 7 remaining ) Sakai ! Oda ! What 's going on ? What are you doing here ? Why the hell did you come back ? 'Cause it isn 't over yet . Werert you gonna keep on fighting ? Werert you gonna remember the ones who 'd died ? Sakai !

See it through to the end ! Go on ! Come on ! Maki ! Haruya ... Hurry up ! Are you okay ? Hello . So , you 're Shuya Nanahara . I 'm Riki Takeuchi . " I 'm declaring war on all adults . " You did it . You 've got some balls . Adults around the world are after your life . From this point on , you 're gonna bear the cross of all the deaths you 've caused , aren 't you ? Including that of my daughter killed in that bombing . Neither of us has home to go back to now , you know . Boys # 1 Mr. TakumaAoi . Girls # 4 Miss Shiori Kitano . Question : " There are only two types of people in this world : Winners and losers . " Is that really true ? Go now . The answer lies ahead , in your future . Y 'know ... It was my dream to play rugby with you some day . Go on now . 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... Go ! Hey , look ! There 's a light . Let 's go everybody . Hang in there . Hang in there ! Hey ... Can I ask you one thing ? The girl in the picture ... Noriko Nakagawa ... What kind of person is she ? You are ... ? Shiori Kitano . The daughter of the teacher you killed .

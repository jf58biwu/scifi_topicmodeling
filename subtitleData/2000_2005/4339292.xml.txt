 Futurama [ 5x05 ] - Kif Gets Knocked Up A Notch - CiWaN Whoo-Hoo ! Yeah ! Whoa ! Ow ! Schman ! The great rad spot is mega-Sweet for party boarding . Indeed . Any calls while I was out ? Yeah . You got a telesonic transmission from Kif a couple hours ago . My Kify called ? Kif ? Oh , Amy , you 're back . Another hour and I would 've thought of hanging up . Why didn 't you leave a message , sweetie ? I 've left hundreds of messages with your answering machine ... But you never seem to get them . Bender ! It 's not my fault if you don 't check me . Messages erased . Oh , dearest , this long-Distance relationship is too much to bear . When even an inch separates us , I quiver with misery . So you can imagine how I feel when it 's a billion light years . Kif , don 't cry , or you 'll get a tummy ache . Lieutenant , some things came off me and clogged the drain , so if you can- - Oh-Ho . What 's this ? Well , well , well . Do my eyes believe me , or is that my bosomy swan , Leela ? Say again ? You 're breaking up . Oh . Good news , everyone . You 'll be delivering pain medicine to the hive mind of Nigel 7 . Scruffy 's rolling out a large pill . You 're going to Nigel 7 ? Kif 's on patrol near there . You could drop me off on the way . We could , but we won 't ! It 's a spaceship , damn it , not a prom limousine ! Ooh ! Lf anyone needs me , I 'll be in the angry dome . This is a very long trip . So we 'll all have to go into hibernative naptosis to save oxygen . I don 't even breathe oxygen . Here I come , Kif . They jumped right out of their pants . Oh , what now ? Activate glass window . Kif , I 'm sensing a very sensual disturbance in the Force . Prepare for ship-To-Ship intimacy . Yes , sir , captain . How about I help you finish that dream you were having about me ? Okay . I was just at this part : Let 's try that a little lower and lots softer . Imagine you stowing away and stealing a licensed starship . Oh , it 's so romantic it gives me the shivers . I don 't care how much trouble I get in . I needed to feel my lips pressed against your lip-Less beak . Oh , Amy , I can 't stand having a whole universe between us . I 've been thinking a lot about this , and- - Well , would you move in with me ? Here ? But , wouldn 't it be crowded ? Oh , no , no . It 's really twice the size . You can use the floor and I 'll have the ceiling . See ? Kif , you have so much creativity and niceness . But I 'm not sure if l- - Hush . Before you answer , come thither . This is the Holo-Shed . It can simulate anything you desire . And nothing can hurt you , except when it malfunctions ... And the holograms become real . Well , that probably won 't happen this time . I wanted to show you what life could be like if we were together . Computer , run program Kif One . This is so beautiful ! Spirit ! Kif , that 's the pony I always wanted ... But my parents said I had too many ponies already . Yes . I programmed it in for you . Four million lines of BASIC . And if this isn 't the life you want , how about this ? Run program Kif Two . Oh , Kif . We could live here at the shore of the Tranquilibrius Sea , in a time-Share . And I would pluck the moon from the sky just to see you smile . Almost got it . Seems to be sort of stuck . I love you ! Run program Kif-Colon - Slash-Slash-Three ! This isn 't bad . My aunt had a place like this . Amy , we could live in a bus station bathroom for all I care . As long as we 're together , it 'll feel like a castle to me . Kif , I 'd love to live with you . Someday . But before then , there 's still lots I want to do on my own . What was that ? Oh , dear . I fear the Holo-Shed might be broken again . Well , as long as we don 't cross paths with Attila the- - Look ! Spirit ! And there 's Professor Moriarty . Jack the Ripper ! Evil Lincoln ! Right-O , gents . It 's another simulation gone mad . So murder and mayhem , standard procedure . Real holographic-Simulated Evil Lincoln is back ! The Holo-Shed 's on the fritz again . The characters turned real ! Damn ! The last time that happened , I got slapped with three paternity suits . Oh , my God ! Listen up , history 's greatest villains . Get back into the Holo-Shed before I start blasting . Stop ! No shoot fire-Stick in space canoe ! Cause explosive decompression ! Spare me your space-Age techno-Babble , Attila the Hun . Oh . Hey ! Kif , hold on ! I totally want to ! Grab on ! Over here ! Please , hold me ! Have a good one . Oh , man ! Whew . After all that , I could use some relaxation . I 'll be in the Holo-Shed . Well , except for a few broken bones , some internal hemorrhaging ... And a partially barfed up heart , everyone appears fine . Phew . Oh , and Kif is pregnant . Oh , joy ! Amy , isn 't it wonderful ? I 'm pregnant . Yes , it 's great . A great miracle . And not one of those bogus everyday miracles , like a sunrise . Aren 't you a male ? Yeah , what 's the deal ? Just when I thought I 'd figured out you biological creatures , it 's something else ! Let me at him ! Get over here , Kif ! You 're- - Look , I 'm sure we 're all a little unclear on how anyone gets pregnant . So , Kif , pray explain , and don 't spare the dirty words where appropriate . Well , it 's quite simple really . When one of my species experiences deep feelings of love ... We enter a so-Called " receptive state . " You disgust me . Go on . At that point , our skin becomes a semipermeable membrane ... Which allows the passage of genetic material . I held Amy 's hand , and voil√† ! Well , okay . But that better be all there is . Oh , Amy , you 'll be a mother ! What a wondrous affirmation of our love . And all from the touch of your hand . Dude , hold up . Remember when Zapp blew a hole in the ship ? Indeed . Kif touched everybody there . Couldn 't any one of us be the mother ? Hey , yeah ! I mean , what about that , Kif ? Well , I suppose I might have gotten pregnant that way . Or even from a toilet seat . Though , that 's impossible , since I have a private washroom . My home away from home . By the way , Kif , your flush seems to be set on stun , not kill . Look , Kif , I probably am the mother . Although maybe I 'm not . Of course , I hope I am , but just in case I 'm not , maybe we should have a test . A test ! I demand a test ! Even I laughed at me when I built this alien cross-Species genetic analyzer . But I guess I showed myself . Subjects , please enter the chamber . Now to take a DNA sample . When I pull this switch , the materni-Fuge will spin at 10,000 rpm ... Separating out everyone who isn 't the mother- - Father- - Whatever . Faster ! Faster ! Good ! Fry 's ejection indicates that he is not the man mama . Nor is Captain Brannigan . Oh , thank you , merciful God . Zoidberg ? What the hell were you doing in there ? That 's where I live . I have no home . Amy ? But that means ... Leela must have impregnated me when she grabbed my ungloved hand . That explains the poster in hygiene class : " No glove , no love . " Wow , this is all so confusing . Leela , how could you ? Our love has had to endure your constant hatred , and now this ? Stop testing our love ! Oh , please , captain . I thank Leela for the DNA she gave me , but in my species ... The true parent is the one who inspired the initial feeling of love . We call that person the " Smizmarr . " And my Smizmarr is Amy . So the toilet seat is like the uncle or something ? Sorry I got your boyfriend pregnant . That 's okay . At least Kif 's baby shower should be fun . I better put it on my calendar . Thursday . Baby shower . Enter . Might as well plan for my new life while I 'm at it . Set motherhood mode . To motherhood . Zoidberg ? My face was stuck in a pizza . Mom ? Dad ? I know this is weird , but- - Yeah , yeah . We don 't care how squishy alien get pregnant . All we care is that we have grandchild . You 're very open-Minded , Mrs. Wong . Hey , you call her " Grandma " now . Call me Grandma like crazy . All the time . Check it out , y 'all . Everyone we invited is here . Also Zoidberg . So let 's open the gifts . Yeah ! I can 't wait . We 'll start with this one from Bender . It 's my booties from when I was a kid . Uh , they 're already bronzed . They are bronze . And this one 's from Leela . Oh , I just love the bow . I wonder what it is . Yes , I wonder what we got you . It 's a basket ! For picnics ? It means a lot to me . It 's the basket my parents left me in at the Orphanarium . You could use it for picnics . Here , Amy , we get this one for you . Is it a new party board ? It 's a board , all right . An ironing board . We had your old party board converted now that you not be partying anymore . You trashed my party board ? Damn right . Now you a mom . The only surfing you 'll do is under a big wave of responsibility . Oh , this is the happiest moment of my life . You all brought such wonderful gifts . But the greatest gift Mine ! Is the bond I share with my Smizmarr , Amy . For soon , the quivering mass of life within me will depend upon us both . Even now , I can sense it feeding , squirming , searching , questing . And shortly , it will rend my loins in twain ... Burst forth and pull us down , down , down ... Into the deep , dark waters of commitment . That 's so beautiful . Yes , it 's . No ! I can 't do this ! Oh , my God ! Oh , how could Amy leave me ? When will women learn to take responsibility ... For the children they 've helped create ? The quickening ! My time is near . I must return to my home world to perform the ancient birthing rights . Let me know how that turns out . I must now embark on a perilous journey ... To give birth in precisely the same swamp in which I was born . If it 's so dangerous , I 'd better go with you . A gal has to protect her DNA . No , Leela . Tradition demands that I make this journey with my Smizmarr . And since Amy isn 't here , I must go it alone . Farewell , for we may never meet again . My scrapes feel a little better now . Hey , what 's this fat , ugly thing ? A frog ? A toad ? Or your mama ? It 's a poisonous froad ! No one move . I 'm back , baby . Behold . The sacred ancestral birthing grounds of my family . Smells like a jockstrap . I am the Grand Midwife . Hi . I am Kif , of the clan Kroker , come to bear my young . Then let the tea of new life be brewed , as it is writ : " And both shall lift the jug together . " Where is your Smizmarr ? She 's not with me . Oh , the sorrow ! Oh , the shame ! Sorry , I 'm probably just making you feel worse . As long as Amy is with me in my heart , I will have the strength of two . Apparently Amy hasn 't been working out much lately . As the tea boils , please join hands with your beloved Smizmarr . Oh , right . Sorry , but I 've memorized the ceremony by rote . It mentions her a lot . I 'll try to endure . Good , ' cause I 'm not changing it . Now turn , ye two , and gaze deeply into each other 's eyes . What are you looking at ? May the love I sense between you ... At this moment remain with you both through all your days . The tea of new life is ready . Let those whose love created this life speak each other 's names , then drink . Amy . Kif ! Amy ! Is it you , or have I gone crazy with loneliness ? Both . Whoa ! I still don 't know if I 'm ready for this , but I do know I love you . And I want to be here beside you . Great . Now I lost my place . I 'm starting over ! Oh , no time . It has begun . Oh , my ! Neat . You can do it , Kif . Whoa , Nelly ! Oh , man ! Amy , my love , tell me , are they making it to the water ? Amy ! Stay away from my babies ! The birthing is complete . Oh , thank goodness . I will now take my leave . I live here , so I won 't actually be going anywhere ... But you don 't have to talk to me anymore . Congratulations . Way to go , squishy ! There goes my DNA . What a disgusting and beautiful process . That 's birth for you . Well , we 've given them a great start , Amy . And in 20 years , they 'll sprout legs and crawl back onto land as children . I 'll be ready then .

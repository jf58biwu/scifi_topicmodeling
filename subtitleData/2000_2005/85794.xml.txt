 " If anyone finds this ... it means that my plan didn 't work ... and I 'm already dead . But , if I can somehow go back ... to the beginning of all of this , I might be able ... to save her . " Evan ! We 're gonna be late again . Since when do you care about getting to school on time ? They 're putting up the pictures for Parents ' Night . Don 't worry . We have plenty of time . - Is dad gonna come ? - You know the answer to that . Can 't he just come out for one day ? We 've been over this a hundred times . It 's too dangerous for him . But Lenny said his dad 's coming . And Tommy and Kayleigh 's dad . Okay , I get the point . - But I 'm not so bad , am I ? - No . Okay . Have a great day . I love you . I 'll pick you up later . I gotta go . Bye ! - Mrs. Treborn , I need to talk to you . - Can it be at night ? I 'm late for work . I think you really need to see this . Tommy ! Leave Lenny alone . Don 't make me send you to Mr. Voytek . I was gonna show to the principal , but I should talk to you first . - What is it ? - Yesterday I had all the children ... make drawings about what they wanted to be when they grew up . Most of them made drawings of what their parents did , but this ... I don 't understand . Evan did this ? - Can I keep this drawing ? - Of course . There is one more thing , Mrs. Treborn . I feel bad even mentioning . - What ? - When I asked about the drawing ... well ... he couldn 't remember doing it . I don 't wanna go ! I don 't like this place , Mom . It 's creepy . - I promise I won 't make a bad picture . - You 're gonna be fine , okay ? He just wants to do a couple of tests , that 's all . You 'll like him . That 's good . You 're doing great . Just tell me he hasn 't inherited his father 's illness . Result will be negative . But there 's something else you can do to monitor his memory . - Anything . - A journal . - Have him write everything he does . - What will that do ? It could help to jog his memory . He can remember new things after . The results will come back in a few days , and we 'll take it from there . Okay . Today Mommy is taking me to play with Kayleigh and Tommy . I 'll meet their father and see what a real dad is like . Great . See you soon . Evan ? Evan . What are you doing with that knife ? What happened ? Honey ... what were you doing with that knife ? I don 't remember . - Hey , Andrea . - George . Hello , little man . Watch your step . - Thanks , George . - Not a problem . Here 's my number at the hospital , in case there are any problems . And , please , keep an eye on him , ' cause ... Are you kidding ? We 're gonna have a great time today , right , Sport ? Okay . Be good , kiddo . - I love you . - Bye-bye . Bye , George . Go long , go on . Right in the back yard . Here it comes ! Guess what ? Dad got a new video camera , we 're all gonna be in a movie ! That 's right , Evan . And you 'll get to be the star . - I thought I was the star ! - Hey , what did I tell you ? Now , Evan , you have to promise ... your bestest super-duper promise that this is gonna be our little secret . Think you can do that ? - Where am I ? Where did all go ? - Calm down , kid . Stand still . I was just somewhere else ! How did I get here ? Quit act like a retard or I 'll call your mom to tell a shit you 've been . Kayleigh . Kayleigh . What happened ? The good news is the results are negative . I found no evidence of lesions , hemorrhaging , tumors . - It must have something we can go on . - Lf I was to guess the blackouts are stress related . - But he 's 7 years old . What kind of stress can he have ? Plenty . Maybe he has severe coping problems about not having a father . The last time the blackouts occurred was visiting his friend 's dad ? Well , he has been pushing me to meet his father and I 've putting it off . It 's worth a short , Andrea . We can arrange a controlled meeting . A careful dose of sedatives for Jason , some security . Evan comes in for a quick visit and , with a little luck ... no more missing father complex . April , 15th . Today I get to meet my father . His name is Jason ... and he 's crazy . I hope he lets me call him Dad . - My dad lives here ? - Not in this wing , actually no . If your dad seems a little sleepy , that 's because of the medicine , okay ? Okay . It 'll just be a moment , okay . It 's okay , I won 't bite . You 've seen pictures of me , right ? Mom says I have your smile and your hair and your ... He has to die ! It 's the only way ! Jason , stop ! No ! - It 's gonna be okay . All right . - Man , he 's hurt bad . Get a stretcher ! Come on , let 's get him outta here . In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life ... we commend to the Almighty God our brother Jason . The Lord bless him and keep him . The Lord make His face ... to shine upon him and be gracious unto him ... and give him peace . Amen . Come on , where is it ? I know it 's down here somewhere . - Tommy , I 'm bored . What 's up ? - Yeah , what are you looking for ? Shut up lard ass . And you , hold your fucking horses . It 's here somewhere . We should go soon . If dad catches us smoking down here , we 're dead . So , let 's go . I knew dad had a blockbuster here . Lets blow the shit outta something ! Here you go , buddy . - No way . I 'm not touching this thing . - The hell you aren 't . If we do it , you 'll puss out and narc for sure . Ain 't not gonna work this time . Look how small this fuse is . - I 'll get killed . - Not necessarily . Here you go . It should buy you 2 minutes at least . Gee , thanks , friend . For Christ sake , Lenny , you moron . Just do it . Thanks . - You got balls , man . - Sure took long enough . What the hell ! Come on ! Evan , help me get him up ! - Get you ass back here and help me ! - What happened ? Where are we ? - Oh my God , what did we do ? - Evan , come on , help me ! - Oh my God , how could we ? - Come on , let 's go ! - Shit , what happened to you ? - He 's fine , he 's gonna be okay ! Everything is gonna be fine ! - What 's wrong , why isn 't he speaking ? - He 's in shock , ma 'am . Lenny , how many fingers am I holding up ? What is it ? What happened ? We were just in the woods building a fort when Lenny freaked out . One minute he was okay , then he just froze up . Right , guys ? - What happened ? I want the truth . - I don 't know . I don 't remember . Something must 've happened ! Something set him off ! - I blacked out . - Don 't use the blackouts to get out . You 're not making it up ? Breathe in ... breathe out ... and relax . You are completely asleep and relaxed . I want you to take me to the time you were in the woods with Lenny . Think of it like a movie : You can pause , rewind or slow down any details you wish . - Understand ? - Yes . Where are you now ? I 'm standing next to Kayleigh . My hands are over her ears . - Are you hurting her ? - No . I 'm protecting her . Okay . Now let 's move forward in time . What do you see ? I see a car . Yes , Evan . Tell me about the car . Go on . Nothing can hurt you . Remember ? It 's only a movie . You are completely safe . I can 't ... The car vanishes , all of a sudden , I 'm on the ground in the woods . The car doesn 't vanish , Evan . The movie in your head is broken . Now , tell me about the car . I can 't ! It 's coming ! Fight it , Evan . Hurry ! It 's coming ! - Oh , my God ! - On the count of 10 you 'll wake up . - Refreshed , remembering everything . - What are you doing ? What is happening to him ? Make it stop ! 1 , you are feeling awake . 2 , your eyes are not that heavy . 5 , 6 ... - Come on , Evan , wake up ! 9 , 10 ! - Wake him up ! Oh , God . What happened ? Did it work ? Thanks , mom . See you later . Wipe that sad-ass look off your face before you get us busted ! - See the way Evan 's mom look at you ? - Sorry . All right , someone can tell me what the hell happened with the mailbox ? Don 't ever bring this up again . Not ever ! Let 's go . Are you okay ? Holy shit ! Look that fat fuck ! He 's got bigger titties than Lenny 's mom ! Shut up , faggot . No one is talking to you . Sorry , Kayleigh . This was a bad idea . You really don 't remember anything that happened ? - You 're so lucky . - Look , everything is gonna be okay . Lenny 'll be fine . You 'll see . - Sorry . - It 's not your fault . Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny . - Your dad did that ? - I deserve a lot worse . What are you talking about ? What you deserve is better father and brother . All they do is make you feel like shit ! You really have no clue how beautiful you are , do you ? - What the fuck are you doing ? - Buying popcorn . You ? - Whoops . - I don 't believe you did that ! - Why do you have to be such a dick ? - I don 't know . - You see how far he went . - I don 't believe . Stop it ! Stop hitting him ! What 's wrong with you ? - Somebody please help us ! - That 's it , kid . You 're outta here . Get him away ! Get him away ! The peaceful town of Briarville was rocked this afternoon ... in the wake of a horrible act of vandalism . While the police believe it was an act of criminal mischief gone awry ... the tragedy has clearly devastated the community . Now this was the grisly aftermath of as powerful explosion ... believed to have been caused by an unknown quantity of dynamite . Police has no leads , no suspects and no motive for the ... Good night . We 're moving . I can 't believe Tommy 's still pissed at me . He knows I 'm moving away ? He 's been acting real strange lately . He won 't even look at me in the eyes . Duck , here they come ! Did your mom say if Lenny was okay ? He must be . I mean , they 're letting him out , right ? Welcome home . I thought you might like some fresh air for a change . - Is Tommy with you guys ? - No . It 's cool . So , what 'd you do in there ? It was awful . You can 't sleep ' cause everybody is screaming all night . I never want to go back . - Do you see that ? - Yeah . What 's up with the smoke ? Crockett ! What are you doing to my dog ? - Look what you make me do ! - What the hell 's wrong with you ? Kayleigh ! My God ! Come on ! Please , wake up ! Why don 't you fucking kiss her , Prince Charming ? How long I was out ? Kayleigh , what 's wrong ? I 'm sorry . - Aced it . - And time ! Put your pencils down . And place your blue books on my desk before you leave . You too , Mr. Nelson . We 're all in the same time zone here . - Fuck you ! - So , how 'd you do , Evan ? I don 't know . I might 've mixed up some of the stories . Was it Pavlov that conditioned his dog to lick his nuts ? Typical psych major : A complete wise ass . How 's your project coming ? Still planning ... to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation ? I don 't really have a choice . Oh , jeez . It smells like patchouli and ass in here . Cricket , this is my well-mannered roommate , Evan . Yeah . You 're the one that fucked up the bell curve on my anthropology final . - Bye . - Fucking dick . - Oh ! Sweet girl , man . - Found your shirt , bro . You sick fuck . All right man , get dressed . You 're taking me out . - Why ? Aced another midterm ? - No . Better than that . Seven years , no blackouts . Fuck yeah , bro . Let 's do this ! Come on ! Be gentle to me ! I 'm post-coital ! Did she cradle the balls and lick the shaft ? Nice . Look at this fucking guy . Get the fuck out of my bar . Which one of you has the pet worm ? - Worms . Plural . - That 's so gross . Talk to him about it . He 's got the fetish . Watch it . It 's a psych project . It 's a study on memory loss . Better explain before all this excitement gives me a heart attack . - Ten bucks he eats it off the floor . - Well ... if I could figure out how the memories of a simple worm function ... it should help me to understand the complexities ... of the human brain . Let me get this shot . - What the fuck , weirdo ? - The fuck is this ? Well , I guess that 's your game . Smells like sex in here . Yeah , Thumper had a busy afternoon . You 're kidding . He 's so big . Yeah ? Well , I guess charisma and eyeliner go a long way . - You want a beer ? - Yeah . You got any incense or scented candles or something ? No . These are my ... Most guys tuck porn under their bed . All you 've got are comp books ? They 're my journals . I 've been keeping them since I was 7 . Wow . Read me something . I ought to be getting something out of this . That 's all I got to say . " It 's like my mind refuses to believe what I 'm seeing . Hearing Crockett make those awful screams . Just writing about it gives me the shivers . " Come on . Go on . " It was like Tommy was possessed or something . There was a hate in his eyes that ... " Are you okay ? Where am I ? What the hell is going on ? - I can 't get it open ! - Drop it ... or I 'll slit your mother 's throat in her sleep . I got him , Lenny ! Save Crockett ! Listen to me , Evan . Listen to me good . There 's a million other sisters . Why 'd you have to fuck with mine ? It 's okay . It was just a dream . - Didn 't feel like a dream . - Maybe because they never do . So , Don Juan , you pass out on all your dates ? Lenny ? I 've got a surprise for you . You 'll never gonna guess who 's here . It 's me . Evan . What are you working on there ? A model ? Look , I see that you 're busy , so I 'll try to make this quick . You remember that day at the junkyard when we were kids ? I was just hoping you could help me remember ... just any details about it , or ... - I couldn 't cut the rope . - Yeah . That 's good . Anything else ? " Drop it or I 'll slit your mother 's throat in her sleep ! " Jesus Christ . It really happened . Lenny , I ... " Make one peep and I swear it 'll be your last , motherfucker ! " " What I remember before the blackout was hold my hands over her ears . I think I was more focused on her hands on mine than on the mailbox across the street . " - Maybe it went out . Should we check ? - Yeah . You do that , Lenny . Make one peep and I swear it 'll be your last , motherfucker . How 's my sweet girl ? How 's my sweet girl ? You need a change , don 't you honey ? You want to open it ? You open ? - My God ! - Holy shit ! Run ! Fuck , Lenny ! Come on ! - Lenny , come on ! - Come on , Lenny ! Let 's go ! Christ , man , fucking brutal . - Hello . - Hello ? Who is this ? Mrs. Kagan , it 's Evan Treborn . I hope you know how much you upset Lenny . Yeah . I 'm really sorry about that . It took me over an hour to clean up the mess you made . - Can I just talk to Lenny ? - Don 't call here . Mom ! I can 't help it . I 'm so proud of you . Did Da ... Did Jason get good grades ? He got " A " s without touching a book . This area of his memory never failed . Did he ever say that he , figured out a way to recall his lost memories ... years after he blacked them out in the first place ? - Why do you ask ? - I just figured he was a brain ... you 'd think that he 'd figure out a way to remember stuff that he forgot . When he was your age , almost exactly your age come to think of it ... he said he figured out a way to remember his past . I couldn 't tell if they were real memories or just his imagination . Then , just before it got so bad ... he had to be institutionalized , he said he could ... What ? - What did he do ? - Forget it . It 's nothing . He was far too sick by then . " I never wanted to be in the movie anyway . And it was cold , so I wanted to wear my clothes . - Mr. Miller took my shirt off . " - What the fuck are you doing ? - I need quiet for this . - Are you stupid or what , man ? Maybe there is a reason you repressed some pervert in your tighty whities . I 'd think twice . You could wake up more fucked up than now . More fucked up than I am . You think you know me ? I don 't know me . No , it 's my fault . I 'm fine . Can we get through one damn day without you breaking something ? Evan ? Oh , my God , it 's been a long time . How 've you been ? - Same old same old , you know . - No , I don 't know . Fill me in . Well , I 'm going to State now . It 's going good . My mom 's good . - Want a smoke ? - No . Not since we were kids . I 've quit , like , a hundred times . Are you walking home , or ... ? - Can I walk you ? - Sure . - My God . - So ... how 's Tommy ? They kept him in juvy for while . Now he 's working over at Dale 's Auto Body . That 's good . - Still living with your dad ? - No . I emancipated myself at 15 . - Must 've taken a lot of courage . - Not if you remember my dad . Couldn 't you have moved in with your with your mom ? Nah , she had a new family . Wasn 't enough room . Whatever . Well , look , the reason I came back to town was to talk to you . To me ? Why ? Well ... remember when we were kids and I used to have those blackouts ? Yeah , of course . Well , some of those memories have been coming back to me . And I wanted to talk to you about one of them in particular . Well , I 'll try to remember . When we were kids , your dad was making a movie about Robin Hood or something . - What do you want to know , Evan ? Did he ... ? - What happened in the basement ? - Look , it was a long time ago . - I know . - Is that why you came all the way ? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood ? No . I just think that something really bad might 've happened . Is there a point to any of this ? Whatever happened , it wasn 't our fault . We were kids . There was nothing that we could do to deserve ... Just shut up , Evan ! You 're wasting your breath . You can 't hate yourself because your dad 's a twisted freak . Who are you trying to convince , Evan ? You come all the way to stir up my shit because you have a bad memory ? Should I cry on your shoulder and tell you everything 's all better now ? Fuck you , Evan . Nothing 's all better , okay ? Nothing ever gets better . You know , if I was so wonderful , Evan , why didn 't you call me ? Why did you leave me here to rot ? When he was your age , almost exactly your age come to think of it ... he said he figured out a way to remember his past . - Some dude left a message for you . - You can smell from the bathroom . This is Professor Carter . Why you didn 't hand in your essay today ? I was a bit concerned . Call me to schedule a makeup . What 'd you say to my sister , motherfucker ? Last night she cried on the phone for over an hour to me . She said you came and saw her last night . She ... she fucking killed herself tonight . She 's dead . And so are you . If the scar on my stomach didn 't just come out of nowhere ... maybe my father wasn 't as crazy as everyone thought . If I can make scars , do I have the power to heal them ? What about Kayleigh 's scars ? " I never wanted to be in the movie anyway . It was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes ... but Mr. Miller ... took my shirt off . " Let 's go down to the basement . It 'll look more like a dungeon down there . A little light here . - What I say about keeping that shut ? - But I want to see ! You 'll see the back of my fist in two seconds if you don 't do what I tell . Now , in this part of the story ... Robin Hood has just married Maid Marian ... and they have to kiss and stuff like the grownups do . So take off your clothes , Kayleigh . Come on . Just like when we take a bath . Don 't make a big deal out of it . You too , Evan . Come on , let 's go . Let 's go , we 're making a movie here . Put your hands on your ears . What time is it ? It 's time for you to do what I tell you to do . Wrong answer , fuckbag . This is the very moment of your reckoning . In the next 30 seconds , you 're going to open up one of two doors . The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood . What ? What 's happening ? How are you doing this ? It 'll change your daughter from a beautiful child ... into an empty shell whose only concept of trust ... was betrayed by her sick pedophile father . Ultimately , it 'll lead to her suicide . - Nice work , daddy . - Who are you ? Let 's just say you 're being closely watched , George . Your other option is to treat Kayleigh like ... see , like a loving father treats his daughter . Sound okay to you , Papa ? Listen close then , fuckbag . You screw this up again ... I swear I 'll castrate you . What you need to do is discipline your son , Tommy ... because the kid is one sadistic pup . One last thing . Don 't ever touch me again ! I won 't . Faster ! Crockett ! Kayleigh , I can 't believe you came ! I think you got one . Check out our new house . Honey , are you all right ? - My God , Evan , you 're bleeding ! - Kayleigh . It 's you . Incredible . Well , thanks . Go get cleaned up and come back to bed . - Where are my clothes ? - Those are your clothes , silly . The bathroom 's ... ? Hurry up . I want a quickie before school . What ? Un-fucking-believable . I wish I could get as excited over a nose bleed . Sorry , I didn 't see you . You 're the girl that was with those assholes throwing popcorn at Thumper . What ? And your name is Gwen . I know you . Seriously , Evan , lay off the blow . Don 't freak out when I ask you this ... but do you remember when your dad got that video camera ? What 's up , man ? I think he had it the first day and then he gave it away or something . Why would that freak me out ? I don 't know . - Just being weird . - You are such a goofus . - So I 'll see you tonight . - Okay . - Come on , mom . - Andrea ... - Evan ... - And Chuck aren 't home right now ! You know what to do . Hey , Mom , it 's me . And hey , Chuck . I 'm just calling to say hi . Just give me a call back . Thumper , do you know what time it is , man ? What 's the matter ? You lost your Rolex ? Fuck you , frat boy ! Remember , there 's only two more weeks ... until your psych projects are due . About that essay I missed last week . We 're still okay with the extension ? - And you are ... ? - Evan . Treborn . The answer 's no , Mr. Treborn . Please sit down . The exam is about to begin . All right , settle down , everyone . The exam will begin in one minute . Get off me , asshole . You guys started that shit . Evan , you 're hysterical . Did you study for this ? - We 'll find out , huh ? - Me neither . - Holy shit . Are these the answers ? - Damn , Evan keep it on the DL . I want to do something special for Kayleigh tomorrow night ... so if I said that I needed some help from you and the brothers ... I 'd say , " Blow me . " Get the pledges to do it . - Right . The pledges ? - Yeah . You may begin now ! That was so good . Oh , my God . Where 'd you learn those new tricks ? It wasn 't weird , was it ? Yeah , if you call multiple orgasms weird ... Fuck them . What do you think it is about us ... that makes us so perfect ? I mean ... why did you sneak out to visit me after I moved away ? Because I missed you . You think my dad could 've stopped me from seeing you ? What 's he gonna do ? Oh , my Gosh , my toes are numb . Do you think that we 'll be together forever ? That is a plan , isn 't it ? - Hell or high water ? - Yeah . That 's ... I was just making sure . Yeah . That 's the plan . All right . All you rushes , you know what you have to do for me . Pledges . We 're pledges , sir . Brother Evan , sir . Are you kidding me ? What ? What 'd you say to me ? You know what , give me the Greek alphabet . Give it to me . - Alpha , beta ... - Gamma , delta , epsilon , zeta ... eta , theta , iota , kappa , lambda , mu , nu , xi , omicron , pi ... rho , sigma , tau , upsilon , phi , chi , psi , omega , sir ! Maybe that 's what it is ! Don 't fucking look at me ! Look down . All right . So , you pledges , you guys know what you need to do for me . Take a shower and if anyone gives any trouble , tell I said it was ok . What ? Shower up , bitch . - Where are you taking me ? - I 'm not telling . Oh my God ! Wow . It 's beautiful . Go on . Sit down . Thank you . Why are you doing this for me ? When I woke up this morning ... I saw your smile . That smile . And I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you . I 've been looking all over for you . Someone trashed your car . What the ... ? Who did this ? Who did it ? It was probably those Beta fuckers ! How did somebody get away with this right in front of the frat house ? - Dude , what is that , a dog collar ? - Tommy . Don 't . He might be watching . It 's my fault . I should 've told you that he was released few weeks ago . Might 've been nice . Like this will do any good . Maybe one of the frat guys got a gun . Evan ! Don 't even joke ! He 's not gonna hurt you , okay ? He 's just trying to scare you away from me . - He killed my dog . Remember ? - Evan , it 's not his fault . You know how bad he had it when we were kids . Oh , no . Don 't give me this bad upbringing shit . - You turned out just fine . - My father never laid a hand on me ! It 's like that prick saved it all for Tommy ! All right . We 'll let campus security deal with it . I think I should sleep alone . No . You 're not staying alone . I 'm staying with you . Evan , I just don 't want Tommy to see us together right now . No . I lost you once and I 'm not losing you again . What do you mean ? Evan , you never lost me . What are you talking about ? God , you 've been acting so weird lately ! Look , my car just got wrecked , okay . I 'm kind of freaked out . I know , but your accent 's changed , you don 't even walk the same . - I walk differently ? - I mean , that dinner tonight ... It was so beautiful , it was gorgeous but it just wasn 't you . - I can 't do something nice for you ? Wait . Isn 't that your jacket ? Tommy ! - Stay away from us , you sick fuck . - Get this " us " shit . Like I 'd ever lay a hand on my own sister . You 've done real nice for yourself . You got a nice life ... you got nice friends . Not to mention you 're fucking my sister . - Not a bad piece of ass if I say so . - Shut up , Tommy ! Oh , come on . That 's a compliment . - What are you doing , man ? - It 's not good the world loves you ... you got to take the only thing that doesn 't think I 'm a piece of shit ? - Tommy , you know I love you . - No one thinks you 're a shit . Oh , yeah ? What was it you said ? I believe it was , " sick fuck " ! No ! Tommy ! Stop ! Stop ! - Oh , my God ! - Tommy ... Stop ! Oh my God ! - Stop it ! You 're going to kill him ! - He 's a fucking maniac ! Don 't do this , I 'm begging you ! You ruined Lenny 's life ! You killed Crockett ! You killed that woman and her baby ! Now you 're trying to kill me ! You 're trying to fucking kill me ! Oh my God ! What did you do ? Drop the bat ! You , faggy ! First time ? Yeah . Better not bitch out , man . You 'll wind up someone 's luggage that way . Can you protect me ? Jesus himself couldn 't make me stand up against the Brotherhood . Look man ... when they come ... you go someplace else in your head . Be somewhere else . - Back your ass off ! - Move your ass . Hey , yo ! Give me that . I spoke to your lawyer ... and he says he 's sure he can get you off on self-defense . - So if you 're just patient ... - Mom how long am I gonna be in here ? - I don 't know . These things take time . What about the journals ? Did you bring the ones that I asked to ? I found these two . - The others are still in storage . - Mom ! I need them all . All of them . I 'm going to get them to you , but now you need to concentrate on the case . Please . Fine . You 're right . What about Kayleigh ? Is she all right ? Try to tell her I 'm sorry . - Time 's up . - I 'm not gonna lose you , kiddo . Promise me you 'll hang on . Shit on my dick or blood on my knife . They 're mine . Back the fuck off ! Show 's over , ladies . - Get this maggot back to his cell . - Move ! We 'll be seeing you later on tonight , little sister . Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Come on , Reece ! You 're religious , Carlos . Do you believe in that whole bit " the Lord works in mysterious ways " ? Straight up , man . Because I think Jesus sent me to your cell for a reason . For you to help me . Shit . I knew you were crazy , man . I ain 't bullshitting you . Jesus speaks to me in my dreams . Oh , yeah ? That 's cool . Great . Pack of smokes says I can prove it to you . When I 'm out , I need you to watch my hands and face closely . - You need to see the prison shrink . - Tell me if you see anything weird . - Weirder than this ? - It could be marks , scars , anything . " On Wednesday I got in trouble for a drawing I didn 't do . Mommy won 't let me see it . " Hey ! No monkey business , Evan . Sit down and finish your drawing . That 's great . Just imagine what you want to be . There 's no limits . Oh , Mrs. Boswell ? Sweet Jesus ! It 's a miracle ! Look , it 's stigmata , man ! - What 'd you see ? What 'd it look like ? - Signs of Lord come out of nowhere ! Man , I thought you were fucking crazy . - So now you believe me ? - Straight up , man . Want to make a deal ? All right , look . I 'm new here , but I think I get how things work . You either join a gang or you 're dead . Well , I sure as fuck ain 't joining up with no spics or niggers . And I don 't want to die . So ... what do I got to do ? I 'm the new guy . I got to work my way up so ... should I suck your dick now ... or ... ? Is your blood pure ? Well , I ain 't no fucking kike if that 's what you 're asking me . Well , then , let 's see what you got , honey . - Watch the teeth or leave without . - Yes , sir . Come to Daddy . Carlos ! " We took the woods so we wouldn 't bump into Tommy . No smoke yet . " Hold them ! Hold them ! " We took the woods so we wouldn 't bump into Tommy . No smoke yet . " Rot in hell you fucking animals ! Wait , before we ... we need something to cut open the sack . I want you to take this , Lenny . Today 's your day of atonement . I know guilty you feel about that woman and her baby . - Evan , stop it . It 's not the time . - Now 's the only time ! Today 's your chance to redeem yourself , to start over clean slate ! - What are you talking about ? - Evan , you 're acting crazy . Please ! If you ever trusted me before , trust me on this one ! Cut the rope . Come on ! - Listen to me good , Evan . - I 'll do what you want . You don 't want me to see Kayleigh again , fine . Just let Crockett go . Besides , if you kill him now , they 'll stick you in juvy for sure ! And I know you 'd never leave your sister alone with your father . Lenny , no ! My God , Lenny . I said cut the rope ! It 's all backwards . Evan ? Who did this ? What the fuck , weirdo ? Lenny , no ! Wanna a ride ? Lenny . Somebody call 911 ! Evan ! Evan ! Fuck , Evan ! Hey , doc . What 's the damage ? How much time do I got ? Cute , Evan . It 's a little complicated . I haven 't seen results like these before . Not even with my father ? Well , actually they didn 't have these tests 20 years ago . - So , what did you find ? - Most of the hemorrhaging is coming ... from the outer layer of the cerebral cortex . - That 's where memories are stored . - Thank you , Evan . I 've never seen anything like it . We compared these to last year 's ones ... we found severe hemorrhaging and massive neural reconstruction . - What does that mean for Evan ? - He 's saying ... I 've jammed 40 years worth of memories into my head in a year . It 's overload city . I 've completely reprogrammed my brain . Isn 't it , doc ? Yeah . I 'm going to wait in the car . Light in here is kind of bugging my eyes . It was good seeing you , doc . It was very informative . But , you know , I got people to see , things to read ... It 's me , Evan . Can I get you anything ? What about some of those model airplanes you like , huh ? I bet I can get a shitload of model airplanes up in here . Lenny ! You knew the whole time , didn 't you ? When you put that shard in my hand ... you knew something big was gonna happen . Didn 't you ? Yeah . - I knew . - Then you should be where I am . You should be where I am . " Today I get to meet my father . His name is Jason ... and he 's crazy . I hope he lets me call him Dad . " You ok ? Because you looked like you went somewhere else for a second . I need some fast answers from you if I 'm ever going to fix what I 've done . I prayed this curse would end with me . It didn 't . So now I need information to make things right again you 're the one that can give it . - There is no " right " ! You can 't change who people are without destroying who they were . Who says you can 't make things better ? You can 't play God , son ! It must end with me . Just by being here you may be killing your mother . Bullshit . I 'll send you a postcard when I made all perfect again . No , no ! Just get out , did you ? Nothing . My brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that . - I come from a big family . - Well , I meant no offense . None taken . Is Kayleigh Miller still working here ? Sorry , I never heard of her . God ! Can 't a man get a little goddamned peace in his own house ? - You 're not selling cookies . - Good guess , fuckbag . Remember me ? We had a nice chat once when I was 7 . I got one question for you . Where can I find your daughter ? I thought you were someone else . Make it fast , I 'm expecting someone . It 's good to see you . Can I come in ? If I knew you were coming I would have cleaned the sheets . What do you want ? - Just to see a friendly face . - Time is money , Evan . Money . Guess I can spare 10 minutes for an old friend , right ? So how 's tricks ? Sorry . Occupational humor . I got it . You can stop know . Sorry . Does my line of work make you uncomfortable , precious ? No . Just that you felt like you had to use it to hurt me . I 've been where you 've been . - Where is that ? - You wouldn 't believe if I told you . I know people always say that , in this case it 's not even worth trying . I knew I needed to find you . So I went over to your dad 's and made him tell me where you were . - Then I came here , the rest you know . - You 're right . I don 't believe you . I never thought you would . That 's why I never told a soul until now and I never will again . I 'm the only person you 've told ? That 's a great line . Does that make other girls wet ? Do they actually eat up that bullshit ? You know , I could give a shit whether you believe me or not . Frankly , I 'm too tired to prove it to you . Oh , there 's proof now , huh ? How else would I know that you have twin moles on your inner thigh ? Anyone with $ 50 bucks could tell you that . Okay . Forget that . How about the fact that you prefer the smell of skunk to flowers ? Or that you hate cilantro ? For some reason unknown to you , it reminds you of your stepsister . Or that when you have an orgasm your toes go numb ? I 'm sure all your clientele know that . Look , I just thought you should know . Know what ? That you were happy once . With me . You know , there 's one major hole in your story . There 's no way on this planet I 'd ever be in a fucking sorority ! - You were happy then . - You crying ? - Sure you don 't want your wallet ? - I don 't need it where I 'm going . Are you off to change everyone else 's life again ? Maybe next you 'll pop up in a mansion ... while I end up in Tijuana doing a donkey act . You know what ? I 'm over it . Every time I try to help someone , everything just goes to shit . Well , don 't give up now , slick . You 've already done so much for me ! Why don 't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby ? And then maybe Lenny wouldn 't freak out and ruin my family ! No ! Go back to when I was 7 ... and fuck me in front of my daddy 's video camera . Straighten me out a bit . You 're on my bed ! Get out ! Buddy , I thought it 'd be okay , with you being sick and all ! I am not gonna say it again . " What I remember before the blackout was my hands over Kayleigh 's ears . I think I was more focused on her hands on mine ... than on the mailbox across the street . " Stay back ! Don 't go near the mailbox ! - Idiot ! - Get the hell back ! I 'll save you , lady ! Goddamn it ! I thought I told you two to get out ? Sorry , man , did we wake you ? No . It 's cool . It 's really cool . What the fuck is this ? - Please save his arm . - Can you open up my locker ? - Happy Birthday ! - You wanna go now ? - Can I come too ? - Want me to move your popcorn ? Evan ? Get a towel ! Get a towel ! Evan ! Evan ! - Where you going ? - You ever notice Kayleigh 's smile ? - Lenny is the best . - You guys make a great couple . You ever think that I 'll find someone ? Evan ! - Where are we going ? - We 're taking you to the hospital . - No ! Take me back . - I 'm sorry , your mom would kill me ! You take me back , Lenny ! You owe me that much . What are you geeks looking at ? Must be nice to be so goddamn perfect ? Fucking losers ! Lenny , help me ! God . Here . Get him over . Hey , Brian , how 's your head feeling ? I saw that girl you went home with . - She borrow your razor this morning ? - So bad ! Hey , there 's Tommy . Hey , Tommy ! Tommy ! What 's up , guys ? Hey , man . I did what you said . We 're pooling our funds with the Hillel House ... Maybe I can spin my chair to a " Hava Nagila " techno remix till I puke . - Maybe we should get to class . - What 's the point of psych class now ? Tomorrow I could wake up a dirt farmer in Bangladesh . Let 's go for a stroll . - Yippee . - Bye , sis . What 's up with him ? So Tommy 's really into this Jesus freak thing , huh ? You know how spiritual he 's gotten since saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie . He saved Mrs. Halpern ? Please . The twisted fuck . Here . Why don 't we sit right here . Want a granola bar ? Here . Yeah , I got to fix these things or something . Kayleigh ... do you ever think about us ? I mean , do you ever wonder ... if things might 've been different between us ? Sure , Evan . You were the first person I really ever cared about . - I was ? - Yeah . Yeah . That 's why when I was little , I never went to live with my mother . - I don 't get it . - When my folks split up ... they gave me and Tommy the choice who we wanted to live with . And I couldn 't stand my dad , but I knew that ... if I went to move with my mom I 'd never see you again . I didn 't know that . So , you still think about us together ? Well , it 's crossed my mind from time to time . And ... ? Well , a lot of things have crossed my mind . I mean , I could play out the entire movie of our lives in one second . Boom . We fall in love , we get married , we have kids ... our kids grow old , as do we ... matching burial plots , the whole thing . It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine ! Things like that usually do . So ... do you think that it might 've worth ? Yeah . I mean , but that 's not how things wound up . I 'm with Lenny . Lenny is your friend ... And that 's where it ends . Well ... would it make a difference if I told you ... that no one could possibly ever love anyone as much as I love you ? I 'm not saying that . - Yeah . - I 'm just saying it , like ... if you were a girl would that be something that you 'll wanna hear . Hold on one second , Lenny 's calling . I 'll be right back , Ev , okay ? He 's a little down . He 'll be all right . You forgot to put the toaster on the ledge . Lenny likes Pop-Tarts . You guys are all better now . Man , I know it 's hard , but you can 't give up . - I can 't even fucking kill myself . - Don 't talk like that . I got to get you out of here . Visiting hours are almost over . Mom get transferred again ? What are you talking about ? She 's been here the entire time . Looking good , kiddo . " Lung cancer . " You started chain smoking when I blew myself up . Sorry , Mrs. T , he 's been acting out of sorts lately . Mom , you 're gonna be okay . I can change it . I 'm going go down to the chapel . You 're acting ... just ... like your father . - I 'm going to get you out of here . - No . You 're not gonna hurt anymore . I 'm going to fix it . No . - Are you sure you even packed it ? - My mom packed it . I think she sent everything I ever owned . - Is this it ? - Yeah . - What 's it for ? I don 't get you lately . - Duly noted . - I have to ask you one last favor . - What ? Be quiet . I have to concentrate to destroy the blockbuster . - What ? The blockbuster ? - Lf I hadn 't blown off my arms ... my mom would have never started smoking . Never mind . Just open it . Turn it . There . " Today Mommy is taking me to play with Kayleigh and Tommy . I will meet their father and see what a real dad is like . " Now , how do I destroy the blockbuster ? Evan ? What are you doing with that knife ? That didn 't work . You want to ... ? Turn it . Turn it . There . " I never wanted to be in the movie anyway . I wanted to wear my clothes . Mr. Miller took my shirt off . " And in this part of the story , Robin Hood has just married Maid Marian ... and they have to kiss and stuff like grownups do . Wait . I need my belt . Don 't even bother about a belt . Back off , fuckbag . Amazing that word never fails to impress you . Easy does it , Evan . Don 't be a bad boy or I 'll tell your ma what a naughty little shit you are . I 'll tell child protective service of your little kiddie porn endeavors . One step closer and I 'll shove this up your ass . - You could blow off your hands . - Been there , done that . - Sparkler . - Kayleigh , no ! No ! Kayleigh , no ! Hey , man ? Good , kiddo . I 've got no choice but to ... Evan , you 'll have to live somewhere else for a while . I 'm so sick of it ! I want my medication . How do they treat you ? - Where are my goddamn books ? - We 're not supposed to meet for another hour . - Where are my goddamn books ? Books ? My journals . I need them . So if you could give them to me , it 'll help a lot . It hurts me to go through this again . There are no journals . There never were . It 's part of the fantasy created to cope with the guilt of kill Kayleigh . Think , Evan . Think ! You 've created a disease that does not exist . Alternate universes with colleges and prisons and paraplegia . I want my journals now ! I know you got them ! You 're going to give them to me ! You 're not going to hide them from me ! I want them ! You remind me of your father . He was always screaming for a photo album even though he never had one . I 'm so sorry . Photo album ? - Photos . - Evan ? The damage is irreparable . Frankly , I 'm surprised he still has use of his motor functions . Mom ? Did you remember to bring those home movies that we used to make ? Yeah , they 're right here . Good . Because I really like to watch them . So that 's good . I think it 's best we transfer him to Bellevue first thing in the morning . " If anyone finds this ... it means that my plan didn 't work ... and I 'm already dead . " He 's not in his room . Search the grounds ! " But if I can somehow go back ... to the beginning of all of this ... I might be able ... to save her . " Evan ! - Over here ! - Evan ! Evan ! - What 's your name ? - Kayleigh . This is Evan . Evan ! Let me in ! Say hi . Go on I hate you . If you come near me again ... I 'll kill you and your whole damn family ! What happened , sweetie ? What 's wrong ? Goodbye . Sparkler . Kayleigh , Tommy ! I missed you . I 'll never let you out of my sight again . Like the sacrifices our parents have made for us to be here today . Good , Tommy ! Are you all right ? - Where 's Kayleigh ? - Who 's Kayleigh ? " Who 's Kayleigh ? " " Who 's Kayleigh ? " - Want me to take you to the doctor ? - No . No . I think everything 's gonna be all right this time . You sure about this ? I know who I am . I don 't need a bunch of stuff to remind me . I 'm just running a little late . I had to finish up with a patient . Well , get the soup or something . All right . Love you , Mom .

Female student : Terminal velocity ? - The speed you were driving at . - Man : The dog . Dog is random , dog is destiny . Dog is the reason professor neumeyer stands here instead of being skewered to his truck seat . D-o-g . Thank you , mr . Axelrod . This is not a graduate class . Please , confine your comments to the appropriate venue . Make the most of him , kiddiewinks . He is the best physics professor you will ever have . All right , please open your books to willard , page 16 , " principles of particles . " So ... i meant to work on reality sets all spring , but i got hijacked by this idea .

Popovich ... - popovich is a useless collection ... of subatomic ... this entire lobotomized faculty ... carl , you 're not listening to me . I 'm not your thesis advisor . Do you know m.i.t. Wanted me , chicago , cal tech ... i chose this overpriced widget factory because of you ... stockholm ... your refutation of witten 's string theory application ... - you anticipated membranes ... - that was a long time ago . Yeah , but it is still in there and i want that . Carl , you can be extremely annoying . - I can ? - Yes , do you know that ?

Right , okay , so when i research a subject , i research it , like this idea that i have been working on basically since march . - Here , you forgot your jacket . - ( keys clanking ) When you get a look at my special project ... - no , i 'm sure . ... trust me ... - dr . Popovich will love it . - It will blow your mind . I 'm sure he 'll love it , yeah . Woman : Denorvo insurance . Claudia , it 's me . Are you busy ? You sound stressed . Everything okay ?

Is this a new jt 's sighting ? - What 's next ? - No , no , i didn 't buy this . Somebody left this at katherine 's grave . - That 's somewhat bizarre . - Yeah . Who knew you were going to be there ? I mean , besides us . Nobody . Well , it 's not true actually , remember that grad student of mine ... carl axelrod ? - I 'll get you ! - Get outta here . Okay . Listen to me , listen to me . - Document everything ... - yeah . Every conversation , every impression and get witness statements if you can get them . You 're watching too much court tv .

Here is what we 're gonna do , jess , when i get back , we are going to set up the telescope together and we 're going to look at the star nursery in orion . - Promise ? - Promise . Hold you to it . Thanks for staying , claudia . Hey ! Hey . - What 's wrong ? - Nothing . Should i be taking this personally or is it just the whole day ? No , no , it 's been ... you 've been great .

No , but i think she 'll be okay about it . Well , i 'd like to know if she 'd be okay about it ... because if she is not , a couple of months of hot dating is all we 're ever going to be . I agree and i think we should play it safe . Listen , i don 't want to blow this either . We 'll just be careful . - See you later , squirrel . - Bye , pop . ... like this idea that i 've been working on basically since march . - Here , you forgot your jacket . - ( keys rattling ) So when you get a look at my special project , trust me , it will blow your mind . Carl on intercom : Who is it ? Professor neumeyer , we need to talk right now . Step back from the door . Your special project , carl , we need to talk about it . Step back from the door . You crossed the line , carl . Who is it ? All right , carl . Why don 't i take this to campus security and let them deal with you ? Step back from the door . Who is it ? Don 't you dare tell me it 's easy , okay ? Forget the picture . Just look at the shapes . ( phone rings ) - Oh , here . - ( cat meows ) Come here . Northwest psychic hotline . - Hi , hey , it 's me . - Did you open the case ? Listen , i 'm gonna be a little longer . Will you tell claudia ? I 'm stopping by brad and chantal 's , then i 'll be home . You promised to set up my telescope so i 'm going to wait for you - school night and all . - Okay , deal . - Dad 's gonna be late . - No biggie . Hey , wait a minute ... ( bangs ) Ha ! Wow ! Jeez . You should have seen your face . Oh , you bastard . Hey , i want to show you this . You 've got to read this . - What is it ? - A grad student 's summer project . - Stick 'em up ! - ( laughing ) This is incredible . Look at this bullet hole . Is there such a thing as grad school for photoshop ? No , but it 's not flawless you know ... i don 't have a blue parka , i don 't own a green jeep cherokee . And there 's no way i would ever step foot into a redneck bar called " buck naked . " What are you gonna do ? Turn it over tomorrow to campus police . Campus police ? Nah-ah , you need the real thing . Come on , jt , this is really sick . This is what they call obsessive behavior . This guy is deranged . This goes way beyond stalking . You 've got to take this stuff downtown tonight - and let the police deal with carl . - There is no way to prove he did it . Well , is he smart enough ? Or crazy enough ? You know what he is ? He 's a religious fanatic whose religion happens to be quantum physics . Hey , wait a minute . Look at this ... i 'm on the suspects list and he 's got my social security number . My god , this could be ... identity theft . If you 're not gonna call , i 'm gonna do it right now . Wait , hold on . I got a better idea . There 's a detective here , detective irwin sikorski . ( police siren ) Give me tape , lots of tape . Give me room to live and breathe . - When you got here , what did you do ? - Nothing much ... checked for a pulse , but he was flatlined . - Dialed you straight up , detective . - ( police siren ) Let 's see what we have . Autopsy 's going to find that ... or what 's missing from that , stuck in his esophagus . Either asphyxiated , went cardiac or both . No foul play , no fun for me . Woman : I just want to know ... tell doughnut dan to lay us out a few dozen murder weapons , before i eat that evidence , would you ? - Yeah , you got it . - Stand back . - I live right here . - Excuse me . Unless you 're the new evidence man , get the hell out of my crime scene . Detective sikorski , jt neumeyer , i just need a moment of your time . I 'll give you a moment in my holding tank , neumeyer . - Now get the hell out of here . - It 's very important , please . - ( laser gun zapping ) - ( chuckles ) ( cat meows ) You know , if that guy out there chewed like his mother taught him , he 'll be home watching the news by now . How did you find me ? I have a friend who works at a newspaper . They have a scanner , they knew you 'd be here , they knew you had a weakness for pastrami , so ... i got a lot of weaknesses , believe me . So ... you 're scheduled to die on friday , huh ? I hope not , it 's inconvenient . Always is . Hand them out to those guys over there . You got anybody in mind for this ? It 's obviously somebody you know . You must have some idea . Well , there 's a graduate student named carl axelrod ... so that 's a start . Why don 't you ... tell this to campus police ? They live for this kind of crap . Doesn 't it bother you that your name 's on it ? Well , if it has to do with homicide , it better be . I 'm sorry , professor , i don 't do hoaxes , especially ones full of holes . Holes ... what do you mean by that ? It says here . I didn 't attend the autopsy , right there ... " tuesday , june 15th , 2.00 p.m. , investigating officer not present . " You know the last time i missed an autopsy ? - Nah . - Neither do i . Well , i don 't know you from a hole in the ground . But you don 't look the type to me that hangs out in a sleaze pit like " buck naked . " - No . - It 's just a prank . Some junior egghead is trying to screw with you a little . - A little huh ? - Uh-uh . I see people get screwed with a lot . This is a little . It 's just paper . Why don 't you go home and just be thankful you didn 't die with a piece of doughnut clogged in your throat ? Thanks for the pastrami . ( latch clanks ) ( statics ) - Hey . - Oh , hey . - When did you get back ? - About a half-hour ago . Did you get everything taken care of ? Yeah , for tonight anyway . I 'm sorry it took so long . - You know what ? - Huh ? It was time well spent . She 's a good kid . We had fun . What do you say you run a bath and we have a little fun too ? Huh ? I 'll be right up . I 'm just gonna show jesse the orion nebula . Those are baby stars , jesse , made up from gases and space dust . You know the light we 're seeing tonight was emitted 1,500 years ago ? Wow ! You opened the case , didn 't you ? Entrez . - Care to join me ? - Absolutely . Thank you . - For what ? - For being here , being so good to jesse , but most of all for being naked in this bathtub . Want to wash my back ? - You , tease . - Absolutely . I 've got a present for you . I thought it would be perfect for you , so ... what did you do ? Do you like it ? What 's wrong ? But i just bought it , jt . How could carl know right down to the color ? You know , i mean ... every second parka is blue . It 's a coincidence . It 's ... look , you weren 't even at my funerals . You wouldn 't miss that , would you ? I mean , it 's ... claudia , look , i 'm a physics teacher , i 'm a single dad . I do jigsaw puzzles , for god 's sake . Who 'd want to kill me ? I 'm too damn dull . - Do you want to kill me ? - How ? Do you think brad wants to kill me ? Why would brad want to kill you ? He 's your brother-in-law . Yeah , well , but i 'm gonna show you something here . - You 're both on the suspect list . - Wow , i 'm a suspect . Yeah , along with carl who worships me for some reason , and there 's some guy i 've never heard of . Who ? Roy bremmer . This is really unromantic . I think we need to ... - just put this away . - Let 's take a rain check . No , i mean claudia , you can still stay . Another time . - Claudia , what 's wrong , I ... - nothing 's wrong . I mean , i know this whole thing is kind of spooky but ... nothing 's wrong . I just think it would be better if we did it another time , that 's all . So when did claudia go home ? Huh , last night . I thought ... hmm , never mind . Hey , jess ... you know , now might be a good time to talk about claudia and us . That 's okay , i think i 'm gonna go and get dressed , you know . Oh . Jess ... please , tell me what 's in the case . 'Cause i know that you opened it . Stuff for me . Well , i found it , so i think i have a right to look . No . It has my name on it and the stuff inside is clearly meant for me . So once i find out what it all means and if it 's appropriate i will show it to you . ( honking ) You know what that probably is ? It 's probably our loaner . Sweet . - Excuse me . - Wow ! - Mr. Neumeyer ? - Yeah . Sorry about our rush hour traffic . I 'm here to take your truck to the repair shop . Oh , here we are . - ( music playing ) - I reckon she 's found the radio . - Enjoy . - ( loud music playing ) Thanks , i 'm sure we will . Broken glass screaming at my face thoughts are bleeding all around this place seems to me you 're trying to ... all righty . You realize once the truck is fixed , we 're back to plebe status . It 's just fun having nice things . I mean , really nice things like uncle brad 's and chantal 's nice . - Oh , i see . - Love you . - Love you , bye . - Bye , see you later . ( laughter ) ( dialing ) ( bell rings ) Hey , claudia , uh , listen ... i want to take a rain check for last night , but that 's not why i 'm calling ... i 've got a question about the rental car you arranged for us . - Yeah , the thing is ... - ( police siren blaring ) Wait , i better go here . Professor . You got that file on you ? So what made you change your mind ? Carl axelrod , he 's the student , right ? The one you pegged for this ? Well , if he did it , he put himself on the suspect list . Is he really that crazy ? He 's ... until yesterday i thought he was just weird . He 's one of the brightest students i 've ever had ... socially inept , a little creepy , but that 's about it . I 'll check him for priors . See who else carl has been messing with here . - Professor bradley hume . - It 's my late wife 's brother . He 's a friend , colleague , good scientist , better stock picker , but ... no , he wouldn 't be a suspect , even if this thing was real . Seven out of 10 murders are committed by friends or family of the vic . Wow . - What about claudia whitney ? - Uh , my girlfriend . That doesn 't mean she wouldn 't want to kill you . Hell , my wife , she tries to wring my neck at least twice a day . Yeah . Well , imagine that . How long have you known her ? Huh , four months . We met over term life . She 's my insurance agent . What , your girlfriend handles your life insurance ? Did you name her executor or name her in your will ? No , that 's my ... my daughter is my sole beneficiary . - This is interesting . - What ? It says that they found an unspent bullet on your body . That 's like a calling card , a pro thing . I guess carl has been watching too much tv . Who is roy bremmer ? You see , i have no idea , no idea who that is . - You 'll have to ask carl . - I 'll do that . Can i keep this ? I 'll make you a copy . I need to keep this one . Because i 'm gonna prove this whole thing is , you know , a hoax . Of course , it 's a hoax . I mean , what else could it be ? Uh ... you know , i probably should mention this ... yesterday i was given a blue parka just like in the file . And today , this morning , the rental car company drops off this green cherokee just like in the file . You asked me why i changed my mind about this thing . When i got home last night , my wife , she told me i had a doctor 's appointment next week . I 've blown off a couple already , so if i miss this one , she really will wring my neck . Next tuesday , 2 : 00 p.m. , same time as the autopsy , so you miss the autopsy . - Get me a copy of this , will you ? - Yeah . - As soon as you can . - Thanks . P. A : Dr. Anderson to oncology . Dr. Anderson to oncology . Oh , hey , dan , dan ! - Hey , what are you doing here ? - I need a favor . A stress test , maybe ? Some oxygen ? No , can you check the blood on this against mine ? - What 's this ? - It 's a bullet fragment . Where would you get ... wait ... why would the blood match ... i 'll explain later . I just ... i need it as quickly as possible . - ( elevator dings ) - Thanks . - Man : No . I 've got to go ... - ( honking ) That 's great . No , i appreciate that . I 'll get back to you as soon as i can . Woman : I know , that was good , thanks . - One moment , please . - This is outrageous . - Spectacular work . - How can i prove it was photoshopped ? You mean , aside from you standing there breathing ? Yoshi 's got this big voodoo machine down in composing . - He can scan it for tampering . - Good . Ever heard of this guy ... roy bremmer ? No . Hey , how come i 'm not on this list ? I 'm a close friend . I 'm definitely badder than brad or claudia . - How can i find out who he is ? - I can search our database . Hey , lighten up , son . How come you 're so worked up about this ? You went to the police . They 're on it , right ? Right , right , yeah . Can i use your copier ? Yeah . Worker # 1 : Don 't you just love the sunshine today ? Worker # 2 : It 's beautiful . Worker # 1 : We should go for drinks on the patio after work . Worker # 2 : That sounds nice . ( dialing ) Woman : Denorvo insurance . Hi , amy , jt , is she there yet ? Sorry , jt , as soon as she gets in , i 'll have her call you , okay ? Okay , thanks . Newscaster : This kind of weather , you just want a light jacket . That wraps it up for the seattle area ... partly cloudy with mostly cool breezes . Oh , this just in ... it 's not going to be sunny long according to the doppler , we have a storm coming in off the coast . Sorry , folks , get out the rain gear . ( beep ) Huh , claudia , it 's me . Where are you ? I 've tried your office , i 've tried your cell . I need to talk to you about the file . Call me when you get this , okay ? ( beep ) ( church bell tolling ) ( crowd chatter ) ( loud buzzing ) - ( blasting ) - All : Wow ! Blowing up stuffs for grades . Now , how cool is that ? Jt , you just missed it , i 'm so close . - Yeah ... - a transparent material - capable of withstanding 170 gs . - Bradley . It will replace every window in the first world . I wouldn 't mind owning the patent on that one . Have you been to the police yet ? Yeah , we got to find out what this thing is made of . - So you can figure out who sent it . - Yeah ... okay , let 's do it . I 'll be right back . This is really nice . I 'm gonna have to take a shaving from this . Yeah , do whatever you gotta do . You know how long it 's gonna take ? Well , it depends . Can i blow it up ? Kidding . - Call me . - I will . Man : I knew him . - He was a dealer ? - Coke . Yeah , he 's a weird dude . What 's going on , guys ? This big cop just dragged that carl guy out of here . Emphasis on dragged . Okay , i 'm gonna have to cancel today , i 'm sorry . I 'll make it up . Double session on thursday . ( all groaning ) Cop : Get closer together . Closer together , kids , here we go . - All right , ready ? Smile . - All : Cheese . - ( shutter clicks ) - ( siren blaring ) - Carl : Do not touch me . - Come back here and sit . I 've seen those shows with the good-cop-bad-cop . You 're gonna knock me around . - Carl : Professor . - You get the copies ? - Carl : Why am i here ? - Try criminal harassment ... which is gonna land you in prison where you 'll acquire a whole new definition of " physics . " - Hmm ? - What is that ? No one 's gonna hurt you , carl , just tell us why you did it . Carl , is that the special project you said would blow my mind ? - No . - Any mope can make a threat , but a genius needs a genius twist . You 're a genius , aren 't you , carl ? Where did you get the paperwork ? Someone in this department ? This isn 't my handwriting . You forged my signature to make it look real . Who helped you , carl ? Give me a name . It 's dated ... friday ? ! Maybe it wasn 't even your idea . You were just a dupe . That 's weird . That 's so weird . That 's so weird . I 'm giving you one chance to get out in front of this , carl . Lookie , lookie , lookie , look , look , look . Look , look , look ... what 's this ? He didn 't do this . ( wind whistling ) ( crowd screaming ) It 's all right , everybody , let 's ... come on inside . - It looks like it 's going to storm . - Keep going , keep going . - Here we go . - Hurry .

Salted brims , limes , nachos ... i can 't . - Amy : Say hi to billy . - Okay , see you tomorrow . - Okay . - Okay . - Claudia . Listen , it 's okay . - ( gasps ) I 'm glad i found you . I need you to pick up jess today . - I 'm not ... - you know where it is , right ? It 's an emergency , i 'll explain later . - No , I ... - i 'll see you later . ( engine starts ) ( thunder clapping ) ( knocking ) Hello , hello ! Hello , hello . ( knocking ) ( loud music playing ) ( dog barking ) - ( woman yells ) - ( music playing ) ( barking continues ) - Yeah ? - Yeah , listen , the oak tree , it 's going to fall . You 've got to get out now ! You got to be kidding me . This tree has been through a lot worse than this . Yeah , i know , but you 've got to believe me . Hey , butchie , shut up . There 's not much time , come on . What are you ? Some sort of a city works guy or a tree maintenance guy ? - No , i 'm a physicist . - Oh , you 're a physicist . Listen , that oak tree is not going to survive the storm . It 's going to fall , mandy , and when it does ... - how do you know my name ? - L ... - get off my porch ! - No , wait , you 've got to believe me .

Jt : Take it easy . - ( rumbling ) ( grunts ) - Woman : No , no . - Jt : Come on ! All right , just one more step . ( jt yelling ) ( tree cracking ) ( both screaming ) - ( woman yelling ) - Okay , run . My god . You saved my life . How can i ever thank you ? It 's real . ( school bell rings ) ( honking ) Hey , are you picking me up ? Where 's dad ? Something came up . You 're getting wet . Jt : Hi , claudia , it 's me . Where are you ? I 've tried your office , i 've tried your cell . I need to talk to you about the file . - Call me when you get this . - ( beep ) Was there mechanical problem ? - Jt : Not at all . - You don 't like how it handles ? - It handles great ... - it 's the top of the line ... leather interior , cherry sound system , gps . Miss whitney specifically ordered it for you . Wait , what did she ask for exactly ? She said " give me the best one in the lot . " Well , you did that . I thank you . Now i want something else . Okay , i 'll put that on your visa . - ( music playing ) - ( clicking ) ( buzzing ) Is that cop with you ? Jt : No , he isn 't . Carl , i 'm alone . I need to talk to you , please . You still have those papers , carl ? - The thesis advisor consent forms ? - Yeah . Yeah , why don 't you get them ? Jt : And ... okay , i am now your thesis advisor . And this is your assignment . I 'm sure that you won 't be afraid of wherever that might lead you . I am already there . The shadow on the form from the paperclip ? Yeah , and other things . But it takes time to create a mark like that , right ? Years , decades even and the forms are current , but the paper is old and crumbly ... which means somebody either manufactured the effect , or the ... - or ... - or ? It 's from the future . Okay , do you have proof ? It predicted a random event which happened this afternoon . - I knew it , i knew it was possible . - Carl . It proves the theory of infinite parallel universes . Okay , stay with me . I need you . I want you to explain how this happened . Show me the math , the physics , the implications of transferring an object through space and time . Okay , did it just show up on your desk ? Was it in anything ? It was in a metal briefcase . We 're analyzing the composition right now . Lightweight , but very strong . - So the file is inside the case . - Yeah . Inside the file are written documents and photographs . Anything else ? My lost keys . I had them yesterday morning .

Yes , a spent bullet with dried blood on it and also a whole bullet , which was found at the scene . Wait ... bullets ? Oh , yeah , you die on friday . Well ... not if i can help it , carl . All righty , it 's all here , good luck . You know , maybe you can 't help it , maybe it 's your destiny . - I don 't believe that . - Believe ? Just think about all the different things that have happened since that case arrived ... i 'm now your thesis advisor , for one . I knew a scientist who used to tell his students to check their beliefs at the lab door , at least until they could be proven . Well , i now believe that scientist was wrong , carl .

Mandy murphy ... that 's who the flowers are from . Mandy : The oak fell on my house and everything was destroyed . I 've got something else for you too . It 's about that bremmer character . - This is him . - All right , so who is he ? All the action on the south side of chicago - is controlled by a handful of guys . - And he 's one of them ?

How did you think that ... not telling me ... why ... how ... why would you not tell me ? I 've lived in five different places in the last two years . I 've changed my identity three times and i 'm about to change it again . I only came back here to warn you . Why ... why ... why didn 't you divorce him ? Roy takes that " till death do us part " clause literally . Oh , damn it . ( grunts , sighs ) Jesse ! I don 't like being left out . I want to know what 's going on . Hey , no ! That 's enough ! Listen , here is the deal ... you 're the child , i 'm the parent , i will tell you what you need to know . I will decide that . End of story . Now , go upstairs , do your homework . I never let myself get too close to anyone because ... i know soon or later , i 'm going to have to leave . I made a mistake with you . I couldn 't resist . This was ... the best , the sweetest thing i have ever had , ever ! I ruined my life when i married roy ... and now , i 've ruined yours ... and i 'm sorry . I just didn 't expect to meet you ... i didn 't know what i wanted in a man until i met you . And i don 't know , but ... i feel like maybe i woke up something in you that 's been asleep a long time . No . This is for you . - You need to take it . - What are you doing ? Jt , - roy isn 't only powerful and ruthless , - what are you doing with a gun ? ... he 's insanely jealous . - I don 't understand ... - you need to take it . - No . You need to take it . You 're in danger . Jesse is in danger . No , i 'm not going to keep a gun in my home . Jt , just take it . Jt , take it . Claudia , listen , no , don 't go . Does he always find you ? Yeah , but he hasn 't caught me yet . Don 't go . Come here . You just said he always finds you . Sooner or later , you 're going to have to face him . So why don 't we face this together ?

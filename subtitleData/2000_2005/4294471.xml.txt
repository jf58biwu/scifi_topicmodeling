 Hi , I 'm Joss Whedon and you 're on the set of my new show , Firefly . Action . This is my ship . She 's called Serenity . We built her on stage so that we can land on any planet we want to . Basically , we 've built a little house . We wanted every room to have its own character everything to be connected , so that it felt more like a movie than a TV show . This is the infirmary , where , when people get shot which they will , because it 's one of my shows which they will , because it 's one of my shows ... Here 's where they keep passengers . It 's spare , like a crappy hotel that flies . The whole point of the show is to make space like now , like you 're caught in it rather than something grand and unapproachable . Thanks for coming on the ship . I 'm really excited about this . It 's a dream project I 've had for a long time and I 'm gonna do it now . See you guys later .

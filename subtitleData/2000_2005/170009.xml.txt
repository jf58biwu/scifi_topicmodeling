 Yeah . That went well . All right , I got it . Stone . All right , all right . Hi , guys . Right , right there . Malcolm Reynolds . - You old son of a ... come here ! - Hey , Monty . How you doing ? They didn 't say you were picking up this leg . Well , work 's been a little slow lately , so I thought I 'd do some smuggling . - Where 's that sorry-ass ship of yours ? - Monty . Two boats like ours , meeting on an empty rock like this ? That screams contraband to the Feds . You forget the time you got pinched in Beylix ? Always thinking , ain 't you ? Smarts , that 's what you got . Smarts . Now , okay , wait . Something 's different , something is , something is ... The beard ! Oh , you shaved off your soup-catcher . I thought you were gonna wear that thing to the grave . Yeah , so did I , but she didn 't much like my whiskers . - She ? - Oh ! Bridget ! What the hell am I thinking ? I gotta introduce you to the missus . Monty ! You have fallen from our noble bachelor ranks ? I wasn 't looking to , but she just sort of swept me off my feet . Bridget ! Well , she must be a rare specimen indeed . Yeah . It don 't begin to cover it . Mal , I want you to meet my Bridget . So you guys have met . Mal , why you got a piece trained on my wife ? - She ain 't your wife , Monty . - Huh ? - I married her , didn 't I ? - You ain 't the only one . Bridget ! Mal . Bridget . Hey ! Quit it , you two ! Here , now . Knock it off . Damn it , that 's enough ! What the hell is going on here ? What do you mean , she ain 't my wife ? She ain 't your wife , she 's married to me ! - Don 't listen to him . - It 's true . About half a year back , at the Triumph settlement . Only it wasn 't Bridget then , it was Saffron . She hitched me , got on my ship and tried to steal it out from under me ! She is cold as ice and dead crazy on top of it . You 're a liar , Malcolm Reynolds . Now , I ain 't never got to telling you his name . Hell . Fine , be like that . Damn you , Bridget ! Damn you to Hades ! You broke my heart in a million pieces . You made me love you and then you ... I shaved off my beard for you , devil woman ! You 're gonna want to pull your claw out of that bag nice and slow . Relax . I 'm not going for a gun or anything . Just freshening up . You and lipstick are a dangerous combination , if I recall . Turn around . Oh , yeah , just like old times . We don 't have any old times . I just don 't want you pulling a pistol out of of anywhere . You missed a spot . Can 't miss a place you 've never been . Marriage is hard work , Mal . I know it . That doesn 't mean we should just give up . We 've had our spats , maybe I made some bad decisions along the way ... Oh , you are a tweaked one , you are . But face it , hubby , I 'm really hot . Mm-hmm . - Start walking . - Walking ? Walking where ? Pick a direction , just don 't turn around . Come on , Mal . This is my scrap of nowhere . You go on , find your own . You can 't leave me here on this lifeless piece of crap moon . - I can . - I 'll die . Well , as a courtesy you might start on that , because this chatter ain 't doing me any kindness . Why don 't you just go ahead and shoot me then ? I don 't know . Why didn 't you shoot me ? Back when I took my eyes off you for a split ? I 'm ashamed to say it , but I gave you the window . You and Monty fought in the war together , right ? Yeah , I smelled that . The war buddy bond 's tough to crack . I knew if I shot you , I 'd lose Monty anyways . You just had a better hand of cards this time . It ain 't a hand of cards . It 's called a life . Seriously , Mal , you gotta give me a ride . - You are completely off your nut . - I won 't make trouble . You can stick me in a crate , just don 't leave me here ... This was all your fault . I had the perfect crime lined up . You were gonna steal a man 's beard . A million square job . The big time . I was gonna cut Monty and his crew in , but you screwed that . Odd , but I don 't think I 'll be losing any sleep over it . I 've got the layout , entrance codes . - Believe me , this practically robs itself . - Bye-bye , now . I 'm handing you a fortune on a platter . Don 't you want to hear the details ? Whoa , cap . Don 't tell me you got into a fight with Monty . Oh , really ? But I thought we loved Monty . We love Monty , don 't we ? If he had a tussle with that sasquatch , we 'd all be in the dirt right now scooping up the captain 's teeth , ain 't that so , sir ? I don 't really want to talk about it . We got work to do . Let 's shut up and do it . Inara was asking for you , wanted ... So later with the talking then . - Hear you 're looking for me ? - I was . Care to sit ? I was hoping we could talk a little business . - Would you like some tea ? - Okay . - What 's your game ? - I offered you tea . Mm-hmm . After inviting me here of your own free will . Which makes two events without precedent . Which makes me more than a little skittish . - Mal , if we can 't be civilized and talk ... - I 'm plenty civilized . - You 're using wiles on me . - I 'm using what ? Your feminine wiles . Your companion training , or some might say uncanny ability to make a man sweaty and / or compliant which I 've had enough of today . - Maybe this isn 't the best time . - No , no , this is a fine time . You just talk plainly , is all . I 'm not sleeping with you , Mal . Uh , no , I think I would have noticed . I think my keenly trained senses ... You 're not my lover , nor are you my mother , my house mistress nor anyone who has any say on how I conduct my affairs . - Well enough . So ? - So let me conduct my affairs . - Who 's keeping you ... ? - I 've had no one in weeks . Backwater moons , slums frontier planets without even a temple built . - We go where the work is . - There 's all kinds of work , Mal . And ours is the kind that gets you shut down by the Alliance . I opt to stay off the radar . There are many worlds where we can both work . We used to visit them , remember ? Are you saying I 'm doing this deliberate ? On account of you ? That there 's some reason I want you off the job ? Is there ? This is one of the crazier things I 've heard today . And when I tell you about the rest of my day , you ... I 'm not accusing you of anything ... No , let 's set a course for the planet of the lonely , rich , yet hygienic , man . We can park there for a month . Not all of your work is illegal . And the best ... - You wanna keep me off the job ? - Your best job was on a central planet . I stay out of your whoring . - That didn 't take long . - Keep out of my thieving . I know my job very well , thank you . Right , you 're a criminal mastermind . What was the last cargo we snuck past the Alliance to transport ? - That was ... - What was the cargo ? - They were dolls . - Geisha dolls with heads that wobbled . Hey , people love those ! And what exactly was our net profit on the famous wobbly-headed doll caper ? Our cut ? So you 're in the gang now . Since I can 't find work as a companion , I might as well be a petty thief like you . Petty ? - I didn 't mean petty . - What did you mean ? That 's Chinese for " petty " . No , that 's a narrow ... - There are nuances of meaning that ... - You should 've stuck with your wiles . Don 't put all of this on me , Mal . You know you haven 't been after serious work in ... Serious work ? You want to know if ... What ? Nothing . All right . Tell me more about this job of yours . The mark 's name is Duren Hamer . He may be one of the biggest collectors of Earth-that-was artifacts in the ' verse . Guy 's got warehouses full of stuff . But his prize piece is sitting in his parlor . An antiquity of unspeakable value . The Lassiter . The original hand-held laser pistol . One of only two known to still exist . The forerunner of all modern laser technology . Hamer got lucky , picked it up during the war for nothing . But it wasn 't just luck . Tell them . Hamer 's Alliance . Bio-weapons expert during the war . He 'd target areas with valuables wipe out every living soul without damaging the goods go in , take whatever he wanted . Now he 's living fat on a private estate on Bellerophon . I 've managed to get ahold of his schedule for the next 18 months a layout of the estate grounds and every security code for the place . Saffron has a notion we can walk in , take the Lassiter right off his shelf . I 'm confused . You 're asking , if I 've got security codes , why don 't I grab it for myself ? No , actually I was wondering what 's she doing on the ship ? Didn 't she try to kill us ? Please . Nobody died last time . We 're in space . - How 'd she get here ? - She hitched . I don 't recall pulling over . The point is , this ain 't no wobbly-headed doll caper , this here 's history . Okay , I got a question . If she 's got security codes , why don 't she just go in and grab it herself ? Good point . Getting in the door and putting our hands on the Lassiter is easy . Getting out 's the tricky part . It 's tagged and coded . Second it passes through the door , alarms , security , Feds . This isn 't a one-woman operation . - To do this right , I 'm gonna need ... - Idiots . - Partners . - Dupes . That 's what you 'll all be if you trust her . Could be that 's so . Lord knows , ain 't none of us here criminal masterminds . So if you got something better , Inara , something not petty ... I would sure be willing to hear it . So question remains : How do we get the artifact out without setting off the alarms ? - This the layout ? - Full blueprints of the grounds . Could be we look hard enough , we 'll find a way . You dig into that , little Kaylee . Zoe ? You ain 't said a word . Time to weigh in . Take sounds ripe enough . Assuming we can fence it . I know a guy on Persephone . Already has half a dozen buyers . But Inara ain 't wrong . - She can 't be trusted . - I ain 't asking you to trust her . - I 'll be with her the whole time . - See there ? All you gotta do to be a rich woman , hon , is get over it . Okay . I 'm in . Captain says to stay put . Doesn 't want you to run afoul of his blushing psychotic bride . She figures out who you are , she 'll turn you in before you can say : " Don 't turn me in , lady " . This bounty on us just keeps getting more exciting . Well , I wouldn 't know . She 's a liar . That don 't exactly set her apart from the rest of us . Plunder sounds fun enough . She 's a liar , and no good will come of her . Well , as a rule , I say , girlfolk ain 't to be trusted . Jayne is a girl 's name . Well , Jayne ain 't a girl ! She starts in on that girl 's name thing , I 'll show her I got man parts . I 'm trying to think of a way for you to be cruder , I just ... It 's not coming . I was gonna leave you a deck of cards . Great . Another exciting adventure in sitting . Afraid . We 'll be okay . Why the captain is trusting that ... Not her . Jayne . Afraid ? Since when ? Since Ariel . Afraid we 'll know . We should be on Bellerophon by 06 . - I figure the job should ... - I don 't want to know . Least it 's your kind of world . - Got appointments ? - We hit , I 'm gone . I 've booked a few choice clients to get my mind off Mal 's descent into lunacy . Zoe don 't let Mal trust her . Everything Saffron is , is a lie . She 'll get the drop on him which , as far as I 'm concerned , is what he richly deserves . I ain 't saying it ain 't risky . Don 't count Mal out , though . - He knows the estate ... - No details . I meant that . Just be careful . See you when we 're wealthy . Hey . You give me a hand in here . No wandering about , remember ? Or I 'll stick you back in your crate . Bellerophon Estates . Home to the rich and paranoid . Gracious living , ocean views and state of the art security . Including local patrols and multi-code keys needed at all entrances and exits . - Which we have . - Right . You and Mal will split off in shuttle two as we make our approach . There 's a landing port just south of the main house . Prepare for landing . You ready ? Ready . Hamer 's throwing a party this weekend , so you should have no trouble blending in with the hired help that 'll be setting up . All you gotta do is get through the back door . That shouldn 't be a problem , unless someone has been less than truthful . The parlor with the Lassiter is on the ninth floor . You 'll have to disable the display . Won 't be any trouble . Once you get the goods in your hands , you can 't take it out the front door . Nor the back door , nor any door . Every piece is tagged for the scanners . So , what do we do ? - You wanna tell them ? - It was your genius idea . You chuck it in the garbage . All the estates on Bellerophon use this automated garbage drone system . You hit one little button , and the drone whooshes off with the trash . Brilliant . - Thanks . - Except it 's idiotic . The drones take the disposal bins straight to reclamation . Thirty seconds after we hit the button , the booty will be incinerated . Not if we reprogram the bin . Give it new coordinates . Once I override the standard guidance protocol I can tell that disposal bin to go wherever we want . - And where would that be ? - The loneliest piece of desert we find . Here , Isis Canyon . The drone dumps the bin , we claim the goods when we 're all together again . And how do you plan to get to the bin to reprogram it ? You get to the loot , and we 'll get to the bin . All right , we 're planted ! Take her up ! That 's good , that 's good ! Hold her steady ! Hold her there ! Clear . Which way ? Right . This should be it . - Let 's get to work . - Yeah . Okay , she 's set . Be careful , it 's hot . Gorram it , Wash . Hold her steady ! Sorry . - Jayne , the dynoram 's live . - What ? - The dynoram , don 't touch ... - Oh , no ! Whoa ! - Where 's the trash chute ? - In the vestibule . Wait . Shh ! Someone 's coming . You ! You found her . You brought back my wife . Oh , my dear . My own sweet Yolanda . Yolanda ? This boy weighs a solid ton . Doctor , you got yourself a patient to see to . Yes . I 'll take care of it . I thought I 'd never see you again . Forgive me , I don 't mean to make a show . - Please , I 'm the one who 's intruding . - Not at all . I owe you a great debt of thanks . - I just gave the lady a lift . - No . You 've done much more than that . You 've returned to me the only thing I truly treasure . Well , then this is a day I 'll feel good to be me . - Do I owe you any reward ? - No . - Our trip weren 't even out of our way . - I promised him 800 square . - No , but we never agreed and ... - Please . I 'd be embarrassed not to make some recompense . In my study I ... Well , are you hungry ? You both look so tired . There 's food or ... - Yolanda , I 'm babbling like a moon brain . - Hush . We 'll both have plenty to say by nightfall . - Six years . - Is that all ? - From the day they found your shuttle . - They set on me at Parth . These awful men . That wasn 't me . I didn 't know those men . They said they wanted ransom , but they sold me to slavers . - Also unknown to me . - When you left , I thought ... Well , you disappeared the same day as Heinrich . - Heinrich ? - The security programmer . And he was young and I saw you two talking and I thought ... But after they found his body ... They killed Heinrich ? I guess he wasn 't useful anymore . - I never stopped looking . - I knew you wouldn 't . That 's the thought that kept me alive . We have so much time to make up . Well , that 's my cue to skedaddle . Let me get your money . You won 't disappear again ? Never . We gotta move fast . Yeah , he might come back and hug us in the act . You don 't know him . He 's everything I said he was . Oh , yeah , he 's a killer of men . Why , I 'll bet he even eats up babies . You 're wasting time . Let us take a breath here , Yolanda . We 're sneaking into a place you could walk into welcome as glad news . What 's the math on that ? You not adding that Hamer would as soon cut your throat as ... - You would ? - If possible . Nope , that ain 't it at all . You would 've knocked him in the brain were that the case . You don 't want him to know the truth . Unlike all the other , I 'm gonna go with hundreds , of men you 've married you actually want this one to think well of you when you 've gone . My God , could it be , I 've actually met ... - ... your real husband ? - Congratulations . Anything else you want on your tombstone , you piece of crap ? Now I 'm intruding . This isn 't what it looks like . Unless it looks like we 're stealing your priceless Lassiter , because that 's what we 're doing . Don 't ask about the gun though , that 's new . Well , I appreciate your honesty . Not , you know , a lot , but ... - You don 't know what he 's forced me ... - Stop . Yolanda , please , just stop . Don 't look at me like that . I said , don 't look at me like that ! Almost done . I just gotta plug the interface strike plate in and ... That 's a pickup call . How we doing ? I can 't reach it . Wash , we need more altitude . Now ! Working on it , dear . Kaylee . Okay , got it ! Let 's not get worked up . Are you really so naive ? Do you think your life is anything to me ? All right . No one 's killing any folk today on account of we got a tight schedule . Yo-Saf-Bridge , we 'll get on about our ... Drop it , now ! Did you think I was a princess ? That I would stay locked up here in the tower ? With you ? - I hoped . - You 're a rutting fool . - We 're in . Go ! Go ! - Copy that . You wanna finish the job ? Because we 're short on minutes . - I 'm sorry . - How long have you been with him ? - Oh , we are not together . - He 's my husband . Well , who in the damn galaxy ain 't ? I feel so bad for you . Bad for me ? I 'm not the patsy being stole from . If you had half a brain , you would 've called the Feds the minute you saw me . Oh , I did . Emergency signal . For kidnappings and the like . I love you , Yolanda . But I couldn 't think for a second that you actually came here for me . That would be them now . Men . Duren . Peaches . Just call them off . Tell them it was a mistake . You need help , Yolanda . I 'll do anything you want me to . You know how I can make you feel . Please , you 're embarrassing yourself . I 'm embarrassing ? Who 's the dupe on the floor ? I hate to bring up our imminent arrest during your crazy time , but we gotta go ! This is police responding to an emergency call . Request entry all points . What 're you doing ? Good security . FED : Show some identification . Move . Nope . Let 's go . That had to be tough . Yeah , have yourself a great guffaw . No , I mean it . Six years , knowing he was holding treasures , you didn 't move on him . I gotta figure that 's a job you told yourself you 'd never take . Till times got hard enough , then the one line you hadn 't crossed ... My name 's not Yolanda . Never entered my mind it was . I tried . I actually tried . I thought , this is a decent man . - The genuine article . - A working man . Struggling to get by with bare necessities on his private floating island . Yeah , he had money . I thought it would help . I thought if I had everything , I wouldn 't want ... Heinrich , the security programmer . You know , I 'd forgotten his name . Addressing the itch of curiousness you marry him too ? No . I didn 't kill him either . No . I don 't reckon there 's many you killed . Just put them in a position to die easy . - I should 've killed Duren . - Right . The one guy who don 't have it coming . The man who knows you , still loves you , treachery and all . Can 't have him walking about . You must be loving this . A little bit . I 've seen you without your clothes on before . Never thought I 'd see you naked . Can people ever change ? Depends on the person . I 'm guessing the pain of this fades away , you 'll just go back to being what you are . What is that ? A brilliant beautiful evil double-crossing snake . Cheer up , weepy . You made yourself a boatload of hard cash today . You can question the meaning of life on a floating island of your own for a while . You won 't tell anyone about me breaking down ? I won 't . Then I won 't tell anyone how easily I got your gun out of your holster . I 'll take that as a kindness . You just may be the most gullible fool I ever marked . And that makes you special . Well , you can riddle me with holes , Yolanda but I just saw the truth . - I played you from minute one . Well , you got me at barrel 's end . Who am I to argue ? What 's your move ? We 'll be setting down in the desert , leave you to set a spell . Oh , and speaking of naked ... No , now , that 's just low . Kind of evens things out though , don 't you think ? Pants . I really don 't see the benefit to this . However I may slip , you 're not gonna catch my crew with their trousers down . - I can 't turn . - What ? Can 't turn . Not getting any tug from the aft alternator . That don 't make no sense . Unless ... Yep . The filament on the grav-dampener 's stripped . Who could 've done that ? I can fix it , but she put a timer on the motivator and wet-wired the damp ... What does it mean , Kaylee ? We ain 't gonna make the rendezvous . We have to land . Now . No ! No ! Dirty , dirty whore ! Yeah , you better run ! God , where is it ? Ugh ! It 's not here . Looking for this ? I wonder if it works . Oh , well , it 's still worth a fortune . Anyway , this works fine . - Honey , you look horrific . - What are you doing here ? - Oh , just my part of the job . - What part of the job ? You know . I put on the big act , storm away in a huff . Then fly off , wait for you to double-cross Mal , beat you to the spot and grab the loot before you can get to it . What ? You didn 't see it coming ? Uh-uh ! I 'm a little disappointed . Some of the performances weren 't as nuanced as they could have been . I thought they might have tipped that we were playing you from the beginning . Oh , well . Guess not . No , you can 't do this ! You 're not gonna die , you big baby . The authorities will be here in a few hours to dig you out . You can 't . I have a condition ! What going on ? You got knocked out . Did we get a payoff ? Did we get the money ? Can you move your arms and legs ? They 're not moving . Do you wanna know why ? Your spine . You hit it pretty hard when you fell . - Spine ? - Yes . I gave you something to stop your motor functions so you wouldn 't wrench it . Should wear off in a half an hour . You 'll just be bruised . Spine okay ? How much did they offer you to sell out me and River on Ariel ? That 's crazy talk . Then let 's talk crazy . How much ? Anybody there ? Anybody else ? You 're in a dangerous line of work , Jayne . Odds are you 'll be under my knife again . Often . So I want you to understand one thing very clearly . No matter what you do or say or plot no matter how you come down on us I will never , ever harm you . You 're on this table , you 're safe . Because I 'm your medic . And however little we may like or trust each other we 're on the same crew . Got the same troubles , same enemies , and more than enough of both . We could circle each other and growl , sleep with one eye open but that thought wearies me . I don 't care what you 've done I don 't know what you 're planning on doing , but I 'm trusting you . I think you should do the same . Because I don 't see this working any other way . Also I can kill you with my brain .

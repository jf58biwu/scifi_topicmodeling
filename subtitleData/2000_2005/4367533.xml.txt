 Damn , it 's colder in here than it is outside . - Not possible . - Greetings . We have been told we might find a Luxan , here . Hey , buddy we 're expected . Where you goin ? I think we 're being asked to wait . Take a number . Have a seat . No magazines . Typical . Familiar ? I believe it is an Oltek Lamp . Is that a Luxan thing ? It is used to ward off evil . Then the rumors we heard on the commerce planet must be true , after all . Number seventy eight . We 're good to go ? I take that as a yes . Stop ! There . How remarkable ! It is a Luxan . Plus a Delvian and some species I can 't identify . Human . You wouldn 't know about us , yet . I don 't care to . Only the Luxan interests me . Send him closer . What 's the matter ? Are you hideous ? Let me see you ! Have you a name ? I am Ka D 'argo . Rather young , for a General . General ? She must be losing her eyesight . Yes , but not my hearing . General D 'argo . My name is Nilaam . Please forgive me ! I did not realize . We must leave ! You will stay ! You are an Oracan . Does that justify you collapsing in fear ? Stop your groveling , and look at me ! That 's better . Come closer . Closer ! As you must have noticed by now , I 'm dying . If you wish it , I will attend . Think you 're worthy of the honor ? That judgement is yours to make . Exactly so . Let 's find out . - D 'argo ! - No , stand back ! You are ... very strong ! But worthy ! No ! Fraud ! D 'argooooo ! I 'm fine . How the hell can you be fine ? She just shoved her hand inside your chest ! - I 'm unharmed . - Then let me look ! As I told you . We 'll leave , now . That works for me . D 'argo , you don 't want to leave . Zhaan . Word . D 'argo has been humiliated . Yeah , but considering that woman was grabbing his guts , I 'd say he got off lucky with humiliated ! - She does not mean to harm him . - How do you know ? Because she 's an Oracan ! She 's a holy woman revered by all Luxans . And holy women never go bad ? So why is she way out here , all by herself ... alone ? - I don 't know . - Right , you don 't know ! She could have been ex - communicated . She could have been kicked out for putting her hands in other people 's business ! Her worthiness is not in question ! Mine is . D 'argo , just because some ancient Luxan doesn 't like the feel of your spleen , does not mean she has the right to call my friend a fraud ! She called me a fraud , because I am not a General ! - Well who said that you were ? - I did ! These ... are the markings ... of a General . Okay . So you uh , - you got the bar codes of a General , but you aren 't one . - No . In my second campaign , our enemy surrounded us . My General was badly wounded . I knew he wouldn 't survive interrogation if he were captured . So I took on the tattoo of his rank , to protect him . Were you captured , D 'argo ? Yes . But my battle unit was freed before the enemy had a chance to see through my ruse . But you saved the real General 's ass , right ? Right ? So tell me , what the hell is she bitchin about ? I agree with Crichton . Your fraud served a higher purpose , D 'argo . Certainly the Oracan can understand that . And if she doesn 't ... brother , that 's her problem . You 're right . Good . - So let 's get back to Moya and heat up some Irish coffees . - No , you 're right that she should understand that . Wait here . Damn ! We were almost out of here . I have not sent for you . No . Yet you dare to intrude upon me ? Yes , I wish to say something . I could kill you were you stand . I know you could . None the less , I wish to say something . Huh ! And why would I wish to hear it ? Because it is the truth . I was taught that Oracans are seekers of truth , was I misinformed ? You are no General . What more truth need I hear ? An explanation . If you are not interested in the full truth , then you are not a true Oracan . I knew you had strength . But I needed to know , if you had fire . Here are some more . - Some more what ? - Clothes to be cleaned . Oh , no problem . Room for us both ! No , I want you to wash these . Oh , do you ? What are you ... are you allergic to Moya 's amnexus fluids or something ? Just wash them , will you ? Um , when exactly did I become your - your servant ? - Why do I have to wash your clothes ? - Well , you 're cleaning D 'argo 's , aren 't you ? Yeah ! But I like D 'argo . She ... wants you ... to attend her . What exactly does that mean ? Whatever she wants it to mean . So , if she wants to rip out your liver , snack on it with a Chianti , she can do that ? She wouldn 't do that . Well , what is she gonna do ? She 's going to die , John . D 'argo , I know that . What are you supposed to do ? Comfort her , John . Provide support . Ease her journey into the next realm . I 'm to assist her in the Ritual of Passing . Woah ! - Ritual ? - A bonding . An emotional and spiritual link is forged , John . As I understand it , when the Oracan dies , the attendant sanctifies the ascent by transferring energy to her . Strike ... two ! I do not like the sound of transferring energy , either ! But the process only involves little risk . How little risk ? Oh , no , let me put it this way ... how wrong can it go ? I could die . I do not ... understand , D 'argo ! What do you get out of it ? You know what ? You sound like Rygel ! Luxans consider it a great privilege John , to attend an Oracan ! No , not merely a privilege . It is the highest honor we know . So , you get your name on the Oracan honor roll . And that 's it . You also go part of the way into the next realm , John . - When you come back , you 've seen ... - If you get back . When you come back , you 've had a glimpse of the other side . - I envy you , D 'argo . - Don 't . Don 't envy him . He hasn 't made up his mind , yet . Yes I have . - Oh , you 're back . - Only briefly . - Did you find your Luxan ? - Yes , I 'll tell you about it later . Or , if I don 't , Zhaan and Crichton will . Where 's Crichton ? I 'm not dead yet . Nope . I didn 't expect that you were . But you were hoping I was . Hoping I had quietly slipped away , before D 'argo had a chance to return . You need to understand something . I 'm worried about my friend . Commendable . But a waste of time . His fate is ... out of your control . Yes , it 's in your control , that 's what worries me . The spiritual realm frightens you ? Losing those I care about ... frightens me . Isn 't this where you 're supposed to say " Don 't worry , I 'm not going to hurt D 'argo " ? I can ... guarantee ... no such thing . I will , however , promise that I will do all I can to keep him from harm . It 's not very comforting . It 's the best I can do . Okay . Thissss ... Ritual of Passing . How important is it ? You mean , why don 't I just die , like any other being ? Yeah , I mean why don 't you just die like any other being . Well , I could . But , I don 't want to . Do you realize that I haven 't even seen - another Luxan for nine cycles ? - Nine ? And now ... I 'm too frail , to make the journey home . Have you any idea , what it 's like , to be separated from your own kind ? Yeah , matter of fact I do . Then you can 't begrudge me , this one last wish . Packing up all your stuff ? Only the Luxan objects . Oooh , you 're gonna show them off to that ancient mystic you dredged up . Is there some reason why you would care ? Just don 't want you to miss an opportunity . Bet your new friend would pay quite well for some genuine Luxan artifacts . This is not a trading expedition . Oh , I understand . This is one of your countrymen . You don 't want to sully your relationship with commerce . Let me do that . - Ten microts with the old fossil and we 'll be in profit . - Clamp it , frog lips . Hey , Zhaan told me you 're ... you 're gonna do some kind of ritual thing . That 's right . So ? Is it dangerous ? Not in the least . I 'll be back soon . Make sure he doesn 't eat my share of the food . I will . You heard 'im . Yes , I heard him , but somehow I don 't believe him . Are you ready ? No . I know it 's time . I 'm old , weak , and in pain . I know the next realm will welcome me . Still , it 's ... it 's not easy to ... to let go . To enter the darkness . Perhaps that 's why Oracans have attendants . To strengthen our resolve as much as our spirit . Your strength is impressive . I hope it is sufficient . I 'm sure it will be . D 'argo , your spirit , so strong ! I never felt such power ! I must try ! D 'argo ? D 'argo ? What 's going on in there ? D 'argo ! D 'argo ! Leave us ! The ritual isn 't done ! - The hell it ain 't , this party 's over ! - You 're too late ! I said , it 's over ! Damn . - D 'argo ! You okay ? - John , what happened ? - I don 't know , ask grandma here ! - Ah , it worked ! It ... it really worked . No pain , no age . D 'argo ... we did it ! You 've given me life ! Zhaan ? Aeryn ? Need some help in h ... Hey . What have you done ? Nothing ! Well you must have done something . I didn 't do anything , it ... it just froze up all around me . Get me out of here ? When did I become your servant ? Don 't frell around . Just ... just get me out of here , okay ? What 's the hurry , Chiana ? You 're not allergic to Moya 's amnexus fluids , are you ? Oh yeah , very funny Aeryn . Look , can you please just do something ? Zhaan . Finally , someone who 's a little more useful . - What did she do ? - I didn 't do anything ! I just ... Pilot , do you know anything about this ? Only that Moya 's hydric system is failing on a number of tiers . Cause unknown . D 'argo , you okay ? He 's more than okay . He 's the most powerful Luxan I have ever known . You did this ? I 'm not sure how . - Was that supposed to happen ? - No . I was supposed to die , but when I sensed your astonishing power , I decided to try the Ritual of Renewal , instead . - See how well it worked ? - Look , Princess , you damn near killed him ! Actually I 've ... - I 've never felt better . - Neither have I. Yeah , well you ... - you could 've killed him . - But she didn 't . His pain was short lived . And I intend to make up for it . Yeah , D 'arg , I 'm just gonna just ... - buzz up to Moya and see ... - I think that 's a good idea , John . Oh , weirder and weirder . - Oh , your taste ! Oh ! - What ? I can taste you ! I can move ! I can breathe ! I can feel ! You ... are glorious ! We are glorious . We must celebrate . You gave me this , I think it 's only fair that you enjoy it with me . Ow ! Watch it ! Careful with thing . Do you want to get out of here , or not ? Zhaan , I 'm not having any luck here , how about you and the solvent ? The solidified amnexus resists everything I throw at it . Same here . Even the DRD 's are having difficulties . We have a more serious problem . Oh , come on . More serious than mine ? Certain areas of Moya 's outer skin , appear to be ... deteriorating . - What 's wrong , Pilot ? - I don 't know . Neither does Moya . - Patch me through to Crichton and D 'argo . - Yes . And Pilot has no idea ? None . We could use some extra hands , John . Can you and D 'argo return at once ? Yeah , no , I 'll ... I 'll be right there . Uh , D 'argo he might uh be awhile . He 's revitalizing . I need a Ritual of Renewal , myself . Have I finally sapped your strength ? Only temporarily . Mm . Let me know when you recover . Believe me , you will . You know D 'argo , I 've hardly been able to leave this bed for over six cycles . And now that I can , I don 't want to . Oh , you 're keeping me prisoner . Absolutely . I once made an oath that I 'd never be taken prisoner again . So much for that oath . Neelam ... what do you want to do now ? Besides that . Well . Start a new life . Not in the Uncharted Territories , I want to go home . You can do that ? D 'argo , I can do anything ! I can guide your ship home . I can help your friends . I could even make you a real General . My son . I want to see my son again . Then you will . But I have no idea where he is . Then we will find him . Anything is possible , now . Pilot ? There 's been an outer hull breech . Tier Twenty , Hammond side . Decompression ? No , Moya 's inner walls appear to be unaffected . So far . Is this a good time to tell you that uh , I can 't feel my feet ? If we had any idea how Moya made it , - we could patent this stuff . - Useless ! Wonder if I 've got any grenades left ? She was kidding , right ? - Tell me that she was kidding ! - Well , with Aeryn ... you never know . What emergency could possibly justify waking me up ? How about breeches in the outer hull ? Oooh , aren 't the inner hulls secure ? Yeah , but we need you to take your scooter out there in the tight spaces and check for weak spots . Oh , can 't the DRD 's do that ? They 're already doing it , doesn 't mean you can 't help . He 's right toad face ! Pitch in ! Make yourself useful for a change ! If I must . But you 're worrying for nothing . Hull breeches are nearly unheard of on Leviathans . Pilot , what the hell 's going on ? Inner hull breech ! Sluice chamber ! Pilot , seal off this tier ! Rygel , grab my hand ! - Rygel , hang on ! - Oh , hold me ! Sparky , grab my hand ! Rygel ! - Crichtoooooon ! - No ! Rygel ! Help ! Help ! Well what do you know ! He has made himself useful . I 'm ... I 'm stuck . Decompression has ceased . What happened ? - We got lucky , Sparky 's got a big ass . - Pardon ? Butt ... hole . I 'll explain later , Pilot . The good news is ... no leak . You 're a tight fit sluggo . As long as you don 't move . Don 't move ! Call that good news ? I want out ! Yeah ... no , no , you want in . Not out , in , not out . - Hey . - What did you see from outside ? A few gaps in the outer hull and your backside hanging out in space . Am I ... intact ? Seemed to be all there , but I can 't say I looked too closely . What the hell is this ? That is a piece from the edge of the largest hole and it came off very easily in my hands . Well let 's hope it gives Zhaan a clue . Indeed . Woah , hold still ! What ... what are you trying to do , kill all of us , now ? I can 't help it ! I 'm being crushed ! - I can hardly breathe ! - Then don 't breathe ! Who 's that ? And why is she here ? This is Neelam . She 's here to help . How could she possibly help us ? She 's an Oracan . Oh , okay . I 'll repeat the question ... No , hold the question . Neelam , if there 's something you can do , please ... do it . Don 't you dare touch me ! I don 't trust Luxans ! I 'm not going to touch you . - I 'm going to heal the outer skin of your ship . - You are ? Well , hurry . Does this look comfortable to you ? - I thought you said she was ancient ? - Later , later ! John , what 's going on ? Zhaan , did you feel that ? The tremors are occurring all through Moya . They 're increasing the deterioration ! Hey , look , Neelam . You 're making it worse . Stop . It 's a healing incantation , it has to work . Should work . Try another ! Try anything ! I need to meditate , find another way . D 'argo , is there a private place ? Come with me . - Please D 'argo , don 't disturb me now , I 'm trying to find a cu ... - We did this , didn 't we ? We caused this problem . We 're harming Moya . Neelam , tell me . I didn 't know . You have to believe that . Please believe that . What happened ? During the ritual , the power I sensed , I thought it was yours . I didn 't realize the ship was a biomechanoid . - So you bonded with Moya 's energy ? - I didn 't know ! Now you know . And I can make things right . There must be a way . - How can you be sure ? - Because this shouldn 't be happening ! This ritual shouldn 't keep draining strength from the Leviathan , she should recover . - She is dying ! - And I can save her ! I need to consult my Tevek Scrolls . Take me back to the planet . I cannot abandon Moya . All of my resources are in my chamber ! Potions , artifacts , ancient manuscripts , they 'll have an answer . Look . I 'm a disease to this ship . Get me away from her . It might at least slow the process down . Slowing the process down is not good enough . Well let me try everything I can . It 's a little odd , don 't you think , that all Moya 's problems developed just as this shaman woman turned herself young ? It 's not necessarily linked . If it is , Neelam should be able to find a solution . I 'm not sure she wants to find a solution . - Officer Sun , may I speak with you please ? - What is it Pilot ? - I would prefer to discuss it in person . - I 'll be right there . Pilot . My ... connection ... with Moya ... affecting me ... as her systems ... fail . What is it Pilot , how can we fix it ? Don 't know . Amnexus solidification ... skin deterioration ... only happens during ... old age . Moya 's still young . Makes no sense . It makes too much sense . Where 's Neelam ? I will check ... take a moment ... senses aren 't clear . Found her . She 's with D 'argo . Tier six . On their way to the transport hangar . I don 't know if this can be reversed Pilot , but I promise you this , I won 't let Neelam keep what she 's stolen ! Hey , what are you doing ? D 'argo and his woman are gonna make a run for it , I 'm gonna to stop them . - Huh uh , not with that thing , you 're not ! - Watch me ! Aeryn ! Noooo ! That won 't hold them for long . Come on . D 'argo , we must go ! What was that ? Pins and needles , you 're asking the wrong space man ! Pilot , did they get away ? The ... transport pod ... left Moya a quarter arn ago . Neelam , you have already tried four different incantations , it is not working ! I know ! Your transport pod uh , how far can it get us ? Leave my friends ? Some distance between me and Moya might stop the energy drain . - I ... - And if it doesn 't ? D 'argo it is just a ship ! Moya is not just a ship ! She 's alive ! And you are taking her life to restore your own . The life of a Leviathan for the life of an Oracan ! How can an Oracan justify taking life ? Have you forgotten who you are ? Have you forgot what I can do ? I have not forgot what you can not do , which is restore Moya 's life ! Does that not suggest to you that you have taken something that you really should not have ? I can 't give it back now . I can 't lose this . Lose you . D 'argo , I ... I don 't know what to do . Tell me what to do . D 'argo ! D 'argo ? It 's me , John . We have to talk . D 'argo ! We 're out of time . Moya 's hull is deteriorating fast and Pilot can 't do a thing . You know what 's causing it . John , Neelam isn 't evil . That doesn 't change anything . Moya , Pilot , Aeryn ... they will never forgive her . They may never even forgive me . But you ... you must understand . I understand . What she 's doing is killing Moya . She didn 't ... mean it . Doesn 't matter . She honestly thought that it was my energy that restored her youth . She is trying everything she can to restore Moya 's health . D 'argo , I don 't ... know ... what she intended . What I know ... is that it 's murder . And you 're the only one who can stop it . Don 't you think I know what has to be done ? I came here ... to end this . And I will . It 's time . D 'argo , the gifts you gave me . Youth . Happiness . Passion . I know I can 't keep them , but I ... I have treasured them . As I 've treasured you . I 'm not afraid anymore . I 've chosen my path . I just don 't know if I have the will to travel it . I turned back once , I can 't turn back again . I need your strength once more . You know , until today , I ... I never really realized how much I love my feet . Frell your feet ! How about loving your life ? I don 't know you survived , Ryg . Your butt must be made out of reinforced krandack . I have no idea what krandack is but , if I 've lost any sensation below middle level , then I 'm going to test how sensitive D 'argo 's nether regions are with a red hot ... Careful , ticklish spot . You 're looking better , already . Is there anything I can do to help speed up the healing process ? Nothing I 'm aware of . Moya and I ... thank you for your concern . Pilot , what is the normal life span of a Leviathan ? Uh ... many have lived over three hundred cycles . What about your species ? Normally , a thousand cycles or more . However , when we bond with Leviathans , we live no longer than they do . So , when Moya eventually does die ? I will go as well . I would not have it any other way . You want me to get lost ? Why would I want you to do that ? In case you wanted some time alone . I do . But not yet .

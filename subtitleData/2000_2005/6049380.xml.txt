 Anything ? Nothing . Thanks . There 's no sign of her anywhere on Moya 's sensors . Of course , we can 't see more than 300 metras in this stuff . It 's as thick as pea soup . Crichton , Moya 's never traveled in a stellar mist as compressed as this . I 'm having trouble accelerating and navigating . Perhaps Aeryn 's experiencing similar difficulties out there in the transport pod . Let 's hope that 's all it is , Pilot . Stark ? Stark , is that you ? I never thought we 'd see you again . I was meditating , when did you come aboard ? Almost two solar days ago . I finally returned the transport pod you lent me after we escaped from the Gammak base . I 'm glad you woke . I must talk to you privately . I have something important to tell you . What are you doing out here , Zhaan ? I thought you were locked in your chamber , meditating . I was , but I woke early from my time with the goddess . Aeryn went out to that and we haven 't heard from her since . Perhaps you sensed the danger and that 's what woke you . How long 's she been gone ? One solar day . Thought we 'd hide in this fog , or whatever it is , from the Peacekeepers . Aeryn went on long - range recon and she hasn 't come back yet . No signal from her ? Nothing . Moya , is that you ? Aeryn ! Aeryn ? Aeryn , where the hezmana have you been ? D 'Argo , I 'll come on board now if that 's all right . Yeah , we 've been looking for you . Aeryn ? Aeryn ? Pilot , I 've lost the transmission . I 'm locked on her position , but some kind of opening is forming in the mist . I can see a planet below us now . What did Aeryn do to it ? Frell ... Looks like she 's been in some kind of ... battle . I told you . Why isn 't she coming out ? John turns and raises his arm . What the hell ? This is Zeccan leaf . Yeah , so ? I gave Aeryn a plant before . . before I started my meditation . She said she was suffering from head pains . Chewing Zeccan leaf provides a potent neuralgesic effect . You don 't think maybe this is overkill for a headache ? Well , no . No . The plant I gave her was this tiny . Blue , over here . John , you have to get out of here . You have to get out now . How - how - how how long have I been here ? Not long . Maybe an arn . An arn ? Yes . The mist , the opening , it goes . I have to get back to the planet . My granddaughter 's waiting for me . Ennixx can 't survive without my transport pod ! Aeryn . Shh . There 's no other way off the planet . I only came back to warn you to get out of the mist as soon as possible . While you still can . You cannot have a family , a granddaughter . You 've only been gone for one solar day . One day ? Yes . Look , you 're wearing the locket . The locket that Chiana gave you . The one that says , " Sorry I smashed your Prowler . " The one she stole from the last commerce planet we were on . She stole it ? She told me she bought it . Well , that 's Chi ... Look , if I 've only been gone one solar day , then why am I so old ? Why everything I 've lived my memories , everything Aeryn , we don 't know . We 're trying to find that out . Maybe . . maybe your mind created the memories to compensate for your body getting old . Look at you . . I 'd forgotten how beautiful you were . You 're so young . I 'd also forgotten how wrong you could be . If I 've only been away for one solar day , how did this locket here get so old ? Aeryn , it 's an antique locket . I don 't care what any of you say . I have lived for 165 cycles . I have had three sons and watched them die and I have a granddaughter . . Aeryn , stop . ... who will die if I don 't get to her . Aeryn , Aeryn . May I ? Get your hands away from me ! There . Take my thoughts . There . Can you feel it ? Do you have any idea what 's happened to her ? Not as yet . I know it is Aeryn . Same DNA , same blood composition , same scars . By my best calculation , she has aged 160 cycles . In one day ? I 've heard of rapid aging , but ... nothing this fast . Is it reversible ? It 's unlikely . Have you got anything yet ? I 've been analyzing the stellar mist . It seems to be contracting more , but Moya 's sensors don 't find any toxins in it that might have caused Aeryn to age like this . Have you analyzed the planet ? Could Aeryn have survived there for 160 cycles ? No . She wouldn 't survive one . Would you look at this frelling place ? Fascinating . What are we doing here ? We 're just seeing if Aeryn came back with anything . But why ? She 's only been gone a solar day . You don 't believe that other yotz , do you ? No . But she still mighta come back with something ... interesting . Are you going to steal it ? 'Course not . You 're worse than me . I like that . What are you doing in here ? Nothing . We 're looking for clues to see if we can find out how this terrible , terrible thing happened to Aeryn . There is no dignity in what you are doing . Zhaan would like someone to look after Aeryn . Would you do that , please ? Well , you know Aeryn - - why don 't you watch her ? Chiana ... Oh , frell ! I don 't see why it 's always gotta be me . I mean , why do you always get the girls Just do it ! She may be dying . Hey . I didn 't mean to wake you . Hi , Chiana . Would you help me sit up ? Sure . Is that okay ? There 's some water over there . Shh . I 'm sorry . Don 't make a sound , Chiana . No , no , no . Shh . I 'm sorry , Chiana . That 's it . That 's it . I 'm sorry . It 's just I don 't have much time . And neither do you . Shh . what happened to you ? I lived , Pilot . If you don 't believe me , you still must convince the others to stay out of the mist . I 'm glad I got another chance to see you one last time , my friend . What do you mean ? I 'll see you ... again . No , you won 't . Good - bye . Pilot , you let her leave ? She asked me not to alert you . You 're all free to come and go . Are you certain this mist is harmless ? It seems to be , yes . And if I go down to the planet , I 'm not going to age 200 cycles , right ? Moya has not sensed anything on the planet to cause the accelerated aging we observed in Aeryn . John , we do not know what made Aeryn grow old . She will die if I don 't go . I 'm gonna go pick her up , bring her back . I 'll be on the surface 30 microts , max . Worst case scenario ? I age a couple years . Aeryn ! I 've come to take you back to Moya ! Go back before it 's too late . I 'm not leaving without you . Aeryn , look around you . Is this where you lived for the last 160 cycles ? You could not have lived here . I didn 't live here . I lived on another planet . Another place . Aeryn , there 's nobody here . No one . There 's nothing . You don 't know what you 're talking about . Now , please , just go ! Aeryn , no . Come back with me to Moya . Stop it . Go . Aeryn , whoa ! Put the rifle down . Now . You touch my grandmother again , and I will kill you . Wait a minute , you 're Aeryn 's granddaughter ? Of course ! Who the frell are you ? I 'm John Crichton . You 're Crichton ? Huh . She wasn 't making it all up . You 're real . All her life , grandmother talked about you . . About a . . a ship . Moya . Everyone - - my father . . her own son thought she was crazy . She 's only been gone for one solar day . A day ? I 'm 24 cycles old . I 'm her granddaughter . Well , I saw her yesterday . It 's all right , Nana . No . I 'm here . John ... . go . Leave . No , I came to take you back . But the opening only lasts for four arns . It goes away . You have to go . Now . I 'm not gonna leave you ! I 'm trying to save you . If you don 't go , you 'll get trapped for 55 cycles . Trapped like I was . Aeryn , what the hell is going on ? Crichton , go back to Moya . If you want to , come back in 8 arns when the opening reappears . Come back down and you will find me then , but you must go now or you will be trapped . Eight arns ! Be here ! How 's your head ? Like I 've been kicked by a systic . Why did Aeryn spike me ? I didn 't want to embarrass you in front of Rygel on the transport pod , but ... You could never embarrass me . Maybe not . But you 're one of us now . There 's no need for you to act like you 're not . D 'Argo ... I always do what I want , okay ? I don 't know why . It 's just the way I am . I understand that , but- - Yeah , but you 're not gonna change me . I 'm only just beginning to realize that . You 're pretty straight , huh ? Yes , I am . We 're not gonna make it ... are we ? D 'Argo , you 'd better get up here . John 's on his way back . Aeryn was telling the truth , or part of it . She had some kind of life down there . I met her granddaughter . Granddaughter ? Yeah , she said she had to stay . She had to get back through the opening in the mist before it Man , you guys feel that up there ? Crichton . Moya 's sensors indicate that the opening in the mist seems to be closing . Estimated time to the hole 15 microts . Man , holding this thing together is a bitch ! D 'ARGO John , you 're breaking up . Crichton , the planet is disappearing from Moya 's sensors ! Pilot , what 's happening ? I don 't think the transport pod will be able to survive entry . John , you have to break entry . Break entry now ! That 's okay . I can hold this thing together . John , can you hear me ? Pilot , what 's happening ? Gonna make it . Gonna make it . Entering the mist . Now . Are you in prayer for Crichton ? Yes . And Aeryn . I 've thought of something we might try to attempt to discover what 's happened to them . Tell me . An ancient named Delik theorized about what he called center halos . He believed that scattered throughout the universe were mists where all dimensions met and where time ceased to exist . What ... do you think that Moya is caught in one of these center halos ? I thought ... if you and I joined spirits ... Joined with you ? What would that do ? I 've been told that Delvians , during a mind link , can sense the time continuum . Yes , that is what we strive for , but ... few have achieved it . I thought that maybe together we could catch a glimpse and see if there 's a void in the time continuum around Moya , see if no time exists in the mist . But , if I join spirits with you , your mind might overpower mine . It is possible . Like so ? I will lead you . Yes , Pilot . We felt it . What happened to him , Nana ? Oh , Crichton . He was happy for a few cycles there , too . Something must have reminded him , thank you , of his past . I still think about it sometimes - - Moya . You 've never been as sad as him . Well , perhaps I hide it better . Will he ever be over it ? I 've done all I can . We took him from the barren planet . Showed him our favored world . I know you 've tried Why are those from the outside always so unhappy ? Because we weren 't born here . This is your home . Not ours . Give Crichton a few more cycles . He 'll come around . You can rack off . I 'm gonna do what I wanna do . No , Crichton . No . I need the wormhole knowledge that you have locked in your brain . That 's great , Scorpy . You ain 't never gonna get that . I 'm dying . I 'm dying right here on this planet and you ain 't never gonna get what 's in my head . Still talking to those visions in your head ? Sure ... Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Yeah , he 's bitching again . All right . He 's gone . Bastard . Wonder if he 's still looking for me . Oh , well . Stark has developed a theory . He believes it 's possible that Aeryn was telling the truth . She has in fact lived for 160 cycles . How ? Ah , yotz ! Have you been drinking fellip juice ? Now ... when Zhaan and I joined an arn ago , did any of you experience anything unusual ? Well , yeah . That was you guys ? And Rygel , did you experience anything unusual ? My thronesled stopped . Huh . I froze in mid - air for a microt . And you were still conscious ? Absolutely . Stark believes that Moya is trapped in what is known as a center halo where time does not exist at all . We believe when we joined for a moment we all experienced this absence of time in the mist . You see , it 's possible that Aeryn aged normally down there on the planet . So it 's us . It 's us who are not growing old . I don 't believe it . You gotta be frelling with me . So this means everyone we know Crais , Scorpius , my son they 're all old now ? Yes . It is believed that nothing ages in a halo , and eventually it hardens , and everything inside is trapped without time forever . Pilot says the mist is hardening now . Yes . Well , then let 's go ! Let 's get out of here ! Pilot , how long until the planet is due to reappear ? If what Aeryn outlined is still holds , the opening will reform in the mist in less than one arn . I 'll go no more a - roving with you , fair maid a - roving , a - roving since roving 's been my R - U - I - N I 'll go no more a 'roving . Yes . It seems like yesterday when we planted them . How 's your knee ? Oh , it 's fine . Just chasing beautiful women up and down these hills Well , why don 't you come and sit down here , old man , or you 'll give yourself a heart attack . Don 't - don 't - don 't you " old man " me , woman . You 're 200 cycles older than I am . Ennixx and that sleeping pill she married have arrived . He 's not that bad . He 's boring . Just like everything else around here , boring . Well , I warned you . I tried to make you go back . I know you did . John , I gave up being who I was , what I was , 100 cycles ago . Why haven 't you ? Well , I ain 't a gardener . I never wanted to be one . That 's all we do around here - - garden . Plant things . I was a pilot , Aeryn . Astronaut . I was what I wanted to be . I ain 't going to forget that and I can 't accept this . Do you regret this ? What ? Spending the last 55 cycles here with me . Aeryn , you are the one thing which has kept me from doing a kamikaze in the transporter . I just have to try to get back to my old life . Just . . for a day . That 's the hope . Hope . That 's what keeps me going . All right . Just don 't be too disappointed if it doesn 't happen . If you can 't- - You okay ? Yes , I 'm fine . I 'm fine . I 'm fine . It 's just the same old pain . The same pain . Okay . Let 's , uh , get you back to the house . You can lie down . Oh ! Gimme that . I got your locket . Whose , uh , image you got in here , anyway ? You know who 's in there . Your husband ? He 's been dead 90 cycles . Why would you have his image in there ? Oh , just to drive you crazy . You know what I think ? What ? I don 't think it 's him in there . I think you 've got my picture . Don 't flatter yourself . Yeah . Yeah , my picture . Surrounded by roses and hearts and yotz . Open it , then . What ? Take a look inside . You 'll see his image . The only love of my life . No , I don 't wanna see his ugly face . Come on . Let 's get you back to the house . He wasn 't ugly , you know . Yeah , you keep talking about him and you can walk down by yourself . Hell , you can roll down the hill . Pilot , are you picking up any transmissions ? There 's nothing . 50 cycles I 've kept this thing sealed up . Hope it works . Pilot , can you hear me ? Been waiting to say that for 50 damn years . Feels good . Pilot , can you hear me ? Why are you going ? Stay with us . Look , come back to the favored planet and I will take care of you . The mist is dangerous . . Ennixx , listen to me . I grew up a Peacekeeper . We are born in space , and we must die in space . Now , I have spent most of my life down here with you , and it has been glorious . But when I die , I belong up there . Good - bye , Nana . Good girl . Now , go . Before I change my mind . Pilot ? Pilot ? Nothing . I 'm not getting anything ! Wait . Something 's happening . The opening in the mist - - I can see it forming . John , Aeryn , can you hear us ? Aww , maybe this thing 's bust . Maybe Moya decided not to wait for us . Pilot , can you hear me ? Pilot ? Pilot ? Anybody ? Pick up the damn phone , you useless pieces of ... We hear you . listen to this ! D 'Argo , it 's me , John . John , are you all right ? Can you make it back to Moya , or you want us down there ? Oh , no , no . It 's all right . We can get back up to you . We will come back up . Right away . They waited . Oh , ho , ho , ho ! Oh ! They waited . Yes , they did . Come on . Aeryn , baby , you all right ? I 'm all right . I 'm fine . Let 's get back to Moya . Goin ' home . I ... I tr - I tried to get back here before , uh ... So 's we - we could ... you , uh ... She , uh ... she died . On the way . She 's gone . Aer - Aeryn 's gone . The opening is on some kind of . . interdimensional orbit . It appears in the mist over the barren planet every 55 cycles . Do you know how to get us out of the mist ? Well , you could go back down to where I was . Then let 's do it . Let 's go down there . Oh , ain 't nothing down there , Chiana . Just a few planets , a small colony of people . I searched it from end to end , there just isn 't anything there . It still sounds better than being stuck up here forever . Yeah , maybe . But I have had a lot of time to think . I believe that if we can get out of the mist at the exact point that we entered it I might be able to get my life back . Might be an arn later , maybe 200 cycles later . But I , uh ... But ... how do we get back to that exact point where we entered ? I might have an answer for that . I 'm not sure , but I think we just have to go ... backwards . What do you mean , Pilot ? Since we 've entered it , the mist is moving with us . I think the back of Moya is still right at the edge of the mist . Then go for it . Just back up . I 've been trying to . But I can 't . The mist has been hardening so much in the last arn , Moya can no longer move . You mean we 're stuck . I 'm afraid so . Have you tried StarBurst ? A leviathan is not structurally designed for a reverse StarBurst . It could destroy us . Pilot , just do a small jump and get us back to where we started . If we 're going to try and starburst out , I think we should go forward down to the planet , not backwards . Is that what you want ? You want that ? You wanna live your life on that planet ? The place where you 'll never see anyone you know ever again . I have done that . And let me assure you , whatever the risk , it is worth getting your life back . I 'm with John . I do not want to live a life without a past . I want to see my son again . Me , too . I never wanted to go into the mist , anyway . I guess I 'm in agreement , as well . Goddess be with us all . Pilot , start initiating sequence for reverse Leave him , D 'Argo . Aeryn ... we 're going to try to get out of this . I told them our plan , and , uh ... There are so many places that I wanted you to see , people ... There 's this lake in Maine . Used to spend summers there when I was a kid . Had more mosquitoes than a dog had fleas . My Dad and I , we 'd camp out there . . and one night , the astronauts landed on the moon . I remember looking up at the sky . I knew right then what I was gonna do with the rest of my life . I couldn 't have been more than four years old . Yeah , I really wanted you to see that . Damn , baby I ... I miss you already . Who else am I gonna tell this crap to ? I love you . Take a look inside . You 'll see his image . The only love of my life . John is overcome . Priming first phase of reverse StarBurst . Kahaynu , protect Moya . Pilot presses a lever . What now ? Zhaan , what 's happening ? Pilot ! What 's happening ? Priming for starburst is making everything stop . We must break free ! My arms . I can 't move . You must initiate manual StarBurst from Command ! Doing it ! I can 't reach the panel ! Help us ! Stark ! Crichton and I once shared Unity . So I can help him . If we join , we can keep time alive for him . Zhaan , how the hell are you talkin ' to me ? I fused my spirit with Stark . You must get to Command and initiate StarBurst . Why can 't Pilot do it ? He can 't move . No one can move except you . I don 't know how long I can keep time alive . Hurry , John . I 'm too old for this ... Hurry , John ! This is ripping us apart ! You must - you must keep going ! Keep going ! What the hell is this stuff ? It appears to be some kind of stellar mist . I 'm running tests on its chemical properties now . What do you think ? That we should go in there ? Well , it might be a good place to hide from Peacekeepers . Scorpius hasn 't been chasing us for a while . I 'm not sure we should go in there . Don 't worry , Chiana . I 'll fly a long - range recon in a transport pod to make sure it 's safe . What 's that ? Something Zhaan gave me for my headaches . You know what they 're about to do ? Yes , and these frelling comms don 't work ! Pilot , looks like we 're all agreed here . Except me . Except for Chiana . Let 's head into the mist . Accelerating now . Stop ! Pilot ! Stop the acceleration ! You 're young . Zhaan , you all right ? What are you doing here ? I thought you were locked in your chamber mediating or some yotz like that . Shut up , Rygel . What 's the matter , Zhaan ? Don 't you remember ? Remember what ? Just trust us . Don 't go into the mist . Why not ? We had a vision . We sense there 's danger in there . I told 'em . I told 'em we shouldn 't go in there . I felt something too , Zhaan . Pilot , uh , change of plan . Hang a louie . That 's left , away from the mist . Hard acceleration ... away . Stark ... how is it that Aeryn and Crichton are young again ? We seem to have returned to a time just moments before Moya went into the mist . None of them remember anything , yet ... yet we do . Because we 've returned to a time before any of it happened . They have nothing to remember , Zhaan . I think we only remember because we were joined when Moya broke free . What about Aeryn 's life and the family she had ? Let 's theorize that through every opening in a center halo , our world splits into an infinite number of universes . Are you saying that Ennixx could still be alive ? Yes ... and mourning the loss of her grandmother . Um ... I 've been waiting to show you this . I found it in a manifest of slaves being sold to the Caton mines . Who is this ? The manifest lists him as ... as " Jothee , son of Ka D 'Argo . My son . My son is being sold into slavery . How long have you known ? Why didn 't you tell me ? I just found out . D 'Argo , Stark wanted me awake before he told you ! D 'Argo , let him go , please ! There 's plenty of time . The auction isn 't for a few solar days . We will find a way to rescue Jothee . D 'Argo ... All right . I 'm sorry , Stark . I , uh ... I 've got ... I 've gotta ... save my son , Zhaan . We 've got to find a way . Nothing . Um ... Do you get a feeling ? About what ? I don 't know . I - I just had this ... feeling . Something happened . Between us ? Well , what kind of something do you think happened ? I. Don 't . Know . If something happened , I 'm sure we would have remembered . Come here . Have a look at this . That 's , uh , the locket that Chiana gave me . I found it in the transport pod and somehow it 's fused shut . I 'm trying to . . Did you put something in there ? No , nothing . Looks like something disintegrated in there .

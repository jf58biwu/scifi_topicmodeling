 Jell-O salad with little pear chunks . It 's the Wednesday special at the hospital cafeteria . That didn 't stop you from eating my dessert . The profiteroles weren 't bad . You didn 't want me to starve , did you ? He ate mine , too . Daddy , take this before my arm falls off . Thanks , honey . Everybody ... One last shot . Oh , Dad . Do you think we could draw the line at 600 photographs ? 601 . Quit griping . And hold up that eyesore , Robert . God knows when you 're gonna win another one . Irv , you wanna stay the night ? It 's awful late to head back to the city . What , I get to stay at the home of the Bay Area Doctor of the Year ? It 's a deal . Proud of you , Robert . Up , hold it up . Say " cheese " . " Presented to Dr Robert Wieder , MD . " " For the great wisdom , skill and compassion he exhibits in the practice of medicine . " It 's gonna look awfully nice in your office . What are you thinking ? How this is just the cherry on top . How lucky I am . - What is it ? - Downstairs motion sensor . - You think Dad tripped the alarm ? - The alarm hasn 't been tripped . You got me . I 'll go check it out . Irv ? Irving ? Is everything all right ? What do you think ? Is this a name , possibly , or a code or an anagram ? T-H-E-E-F . I assume it 's supposed to be T-H-I-E-F . " Thief . " Insert your own Dan Quayle joke here . Lousy spelling aside , who 's the thief ? Well , that 's certainly one question . I 've got many . " Mulder , why are we here ? " To be fair , I might have used the words , " Mulder , how is this an X-File ? " You see that ? You always keep me guessing . This is Dr Irving Thalbro , age 66 . Found hanged with his throat cut . His family tucked away in bed , not 40 feet from here , didn 't see or hear anything . Which would shine the light of suspicion on them . Except they called it in , and there 's no evidence at all to link them to the crime . Which is why the police are rightly wondering if Dr Thalbro killed himself . Except who , then , did this ? Blood pattern doesn 't indicate that the good doctor did it , who I assume could read and write above a 4th-grade level . I 'll admit this is not an open-and-shut case . But it doesn 't make it an X-File . There is one detail that does . This . - Dirt ? - Dirt . It 's a very powerful component of hex-craft . As well as the pattern in which it was originally arranged . Check this out . Looks like a human form . Hex-craft , as in putting a curse on someone ? Murdering them magically ? That 's what it looks like to me . I know what you 're gonna say . No , hex-craft . I 'll buy that as the intent here . It certainly jibes with the evidence . I say we talk to the family . I 'll always keep you guessing . It was probably the greatest night of my life . Until ... Can you think of any enemies your father-in-law might have made ? Maybe inadvertently through his medical practice or a business dealing , perhaps ? Everybody loved Irving . Everyone who knew him . He was ... No . I can 't conceive of it . Dr Wieder , do you have any enemies ? I 'm sorry . I have to ask . There was a message left . If it doesn 't refer to your father-in-law , it may refer to you . " Theef ? " Are you asking if my Dad 's a thief ? He saves people 's lives . He 's a good man . Honey ... If I have any enemies , I don 't know them . At the home of his son-in-law , Dr Robert Wieder , Dr Irving Thalbro was found hanged at 1.48 this morning . Though details are sketchy , the police are treating the case as a murder . This is due in part to clues or evidence left at the scene , according to a spokesman , who only characterized them as bizarre or ritualistic ... Hello ? Mr Peattie ? Mr Peattie , I know you 're in there . Are you cooking ? You aren 't supposed to be cooking . You aren 't supposed to be cooking . That smell like somethin ' you wanna eat ? Well , what is it , then ? Medicine . Oh , all right . Just so long as you 're not cooking . Seems like you could use yourself a poultice for your back . Old Peattie 'll fix you right up . Be ready later . Hey , Scully . This dirt we found ? Gas chromatograph shows spikes of methane and sulphur compounds , the signature of decay . It 's graveyard dirt . Also known as conjure dust . One of the most powerful hexing elements , whether for good or evil . Not the kind of stuff you wanna be on the wrong end of . Go ahead , Scully , keep me guessing . Kuru . The disease that New Guinea tribesmen get ? From eating their relatives ' brains . I thought my grandpa slurping his soup was bad . Practically speaking , kuru doesn 't exist any more . Not in New Guinea and certainly not in the US . But this man 's cerebellum and his striatum clearly show signs of it , Mulder . These amyloid plaques ? His brain is riddled with them . - Kuru makes you crazy . - Stark-raving , among other things . But , in this case , stark-raving mad enough to slit his own throat and hang himself . That 's what his autopsy shows . From the wound pattern to the blood spray , this man did it to himself , no question . Unless ... it was inflicted upon him . The graveyard dirt , the hex . He was given this disease so that he would kill himself . Nan ? Honey ? Robert ? Look at this . Who would 've taken that ? The police , probably . Could be they needed it as evidence . - We 're not under investigation . - That 's not what I 'm afraid of . Then you have nothing to worry about . Come on , let 's go to bed . You need some rest . A good night 's sleep . No , I can 't sleep . I 'm telling you , I 'm scared . I can 't stay here . I can 't live in this house any more . Lucy can 't . Not after what 's happened here . And now this picture of us is missing . - It 'll turn up . - No . Nothing that 's happened here makes any sense . It does . Nan ... Listen to me . Your Dad was ill . He had a kind of progressive dementia . That 's what the FBI autopsy showed . I reviewed their findings , and I have to agree . Honey , we will get through this . Oh , my God ! Nan ! Honey ? Oh , my God . - Nan ! - Dad ? Lucy , call 911 . Call 911 ! Nan ! Dr Wieder . We understand you 've made a diagnosis . Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis . Old-world type . - I take it that 's rare . - In San Francisco , it 's unheard of . Maybe in Central Africa ... - The rarer , the better . - What do you mean by that ? Someone directed this to happen to your wife , just as someone directed what happened at your father-in-law . My enemy you were talking about . The one who thinks I 'm a thief . You 're a doctor . Explain to your partner that no one can direct a person to get sick . The dirt in your bed drawn in the shape of a body , that 's indicative of folk magic . That 's what I believe is being used against you . Folk magic . You mean like Baba Yaga . Gypsies . I was actually thinking less Eastern and more Celtic . Maybe Scots-Irish or Appalachian , even . I 'm supposed to take this seriously ? Sir , regardless of the particulars , I think it 's clear that there was an intruder in your home , and I think it would be prudent for you to accept our protection and help us to identify this person . Prudent for me would be to continue treating my wife . If we don 't stop who 's causing this , your treatments won 't matter . So , modern medicine and all it encompasses , artificial hearts , laser surgery , gene therapy , to name a few , all of that arrayed against a pile of magic dirt , and you tell me I 'll lose . I have MRI 's to look at . Yeah , win him over . He will lose unless we can find a way to stop it . What do you suggest ? A second opinion . Truth always hurts , don 't it , doc ? Who are you ? Is this you ? You did this ? - What do you want from me ? - Don 't you be frettin ' none about that . I gettin ' my nickel 's worth . You 're doing a fine job so far . What the hell are you talking about ? What is this all about ? Lynette Peattie . And don 't you be saying you don 't recollect her ! Uh-uh ! No , no , no . Look , if I 've done anything to upset you , I ... It 's no use trying to intimidate me if I don 't know how I 've offended you ! Tell me ! What makes me a thief ? You be a smart man . I figure you ponder it a while , it gonna come to you . Wait ! No . No matter how I spell it , there 's no Lynette Peattie . - She 's not in my patient file ? - She 's not in any doctor 's patient file . No one by that name has ever been admitted to the hospital . You think you treated her ? What about Jane Does ? You treated three in the last two years . Pull the files , please . You remember old Boon . I know you do . This mangy old ugly dog . Smart . People-smart , and then some . He sure did love you . He crawled up under that house the very day you left . Wouldn 't come out for nothin ' . Not no ham bone . Nothin ' . He just knew that his life was over . You stole his heart , too . You shouldn 't have oughta left . Oh , you 're there . I ... wanted to thank you . That poultice worked a miracle on my back . I was about to knock and ... and ask if I could get a little more . Whatever that is , it sure is stinky . Stinky 's good . Good afternoon . Can I help you ? Yeah , we 're looking for some alternative medical advice , You 've come to the right place . I get a lot of folks fed up with their HMOs . - Actually , we 're not here for us . - Yeah . Oh , chief . Back in your pocket . It 's dirt . It 's goofer dust , is what it is . I don 't know what your intentions are with that . - Goofer dust ? - Conjure dust . How would you go about making somebody sick using that ? We 're investigating a murder . That 's why I 'm asking . Oh . Speaking strictly in the academic sense , you 'd spread it on or near your victim to direct misfortune . So you could give them any illness you wanted , one that you chose specifically for them ? That 's a lot trickier . It requires something special . - A voodoo doll . - No , they 're called poppets . Inside you place three thorns of a blood-red rose , a strand of hair and a photo of your victim . Maybe other items as well . Depends on the operator . You sew it up , say your spell . How would you counteract one of these ? It depends on who you 're dealing with , but if the person you 're looking for is powerful enough to bring about a murder , he 's probably charmed . - Which would mean what ? - It means just that . He 's drawing on the energy of a charm . A source of magic power . It could be any item , provided that it 's very important to him . Something that holds great meaning for him , and unless you can separate him from his charm , you 're out of luck . Poppin ' corn . You gotta put the money in first . Don 't look like no popping ' corn to me . Put it in the microwave . Then you get your popcorn . Microwave . I heard tell of such a thing . It 's a true wonder . Radiation come from the heart of the atom . I think it be God 's own glow . You 're gonna be very happy . The drug therapy I 'm giving her is working wonders . Come on . Come see . - Mom . - Hi , sweetie . - You look good . - Yeah , right . But I am definitely feeling better . How come I have to go through this thing again ? This thing gives off about as much radiation as a dental x-ray . - Nothing to worry about . - I know . It still scares me . Wish me luck ? Doctor ! Switch it off . Switch it off ! All done . How could somebody orchestrate all of this ? - You believe your wife was murdered ? - It was no accident . There was no malfunction of the machine . - Yes , I believe she was murdered . - And you still have no idea why ? The pathologist found this branded into your wife 's chest . Sir , we can 't help you if you withhold information from us . A man came to see me yesterday . My age , older maybe . Tall . He mentioned someone named Lynette Peattie . I didn 't know who she was at first . Turns out she was a Jane Doe I treated last October . She was in a bus rollover . Came in amid a wave of victims . She was the worst off . I could barely put fluids in fast enough to keep up with the blood loss . We were rushing around , triaging people . Everybody knew she was dying . It was only a matter of time . She was in agony . This was my course of treatment . You gave her morphine . Lots of it . I pushed it myself . She kept screaming ... and her heart rate kept climbing . So ... I kept pushing . I took maybe the last 20 minutes of her life . It was a fair trade to make for the pain . Her father doesn 't agree . What makes you think it 's her father ? He thinks you robbed him of his family , and that 's why he 's systematically robbing you of yours . What am I supposed to do ? My daughter Lucy ... Don 't do anything . Let us find a way to protect you . How ? I have an idea where to start . If Lynette Peattie was Carlos the Jackal , it would 've been easier to track her down . There 's no birth certificate , no social security number . Better known to the world as Jane Doe 6149 . Her name shows up once in the records of a VISTA inoculation programme , 1981 . - The Allegheny Mountains of West Virginia . - Deepest Appalachia . That 's when her father , Oral Peattie , refused to allow her to be inoculated against polio . But there 's no address for him . There 's no record of him whatsoever . So , Mulder , why are we exhuming this girl ? I 'm thinking of her dear old backwoods dad and where he gets all his graveyard dirt . Here ? His daughter 's grave ? The cultist we spoke to said the person casting these magic spells was charmed , that he had a source of power that was very meaningful to him and he kept it close by . - Lynette Peattie 's body . - That 's my guess . So as long as her body remains resting in peace in the Bay Area , he remains powerful . But if we were to ship it off to Quantico ... Hold that . Mr Peattie ? Mr Peattie , my pain 's back . I was wondering if I could get a little more of that poultice ? Mr Peattie ? I 'm sorry . I didn 't know you were home . I ... All right , thank you . They 'll be there before dark . - You all set ? - We still don 't know where we 're going . We rented a cabin . It 's important you get out of town . You believe by leaving , we 'll weaken him . What 's important is that he believes that . And if he can 't find you , he can 't hurt you . How do you know he 'll come forward ? Because he hasn 't gotten everything he wants . John Gilnitz is on the scene . San Mateo County health officials are at a loss to explain the sudden onset of the 56-year-old woman 's bizarre illness , but insist there is no cause for alarm . Pretty weird . There has been no official diagnosis . Sources say the woman contracted the rare but deadly group A streptococcus , better known as the flesh-eating disease . Freakin ' scary . Bathroom 's clear . Clear here . Scully . - Peattie may be onto us . - What happened ? I found out where he lives . He 's cleared out and taken his magic charm with him . At least as much of it as he can carry . My guess is he 's looking for you . I didn 't see anybody following us . Just keep an eye out . I 'm on my way . OK . Soon . Very soon . What was that ? Stay where you are . Oh ! Oh , God . - What is it ? - I don 't know . I can 't ... I can 't see . Agent Scully ! Just stay where you are ! Stay down . Oh , doctor ! Leave him alone ! - Daddy ! - Get back . Get back ! Don 't make me hurt you ! Can 't hurt the man who ain 't got nothin ' left . You know who I be now ? Maybe you can recollect my daughter . I remember . I never forgot . I 'm sorry for your loss , but I did everything humanly possible to save her . You arrogant little man . I did everything I could ! And when I couldn 't do any more , I eased her suffering . By killing ' her . If I be there ... I save her ! You weren 't there ! Buried her in some field . No name on her . Far away from her people . That don 't be right . So now , little man , I gonna show you what be possible . I gonna show you an eye for an eye . You 're not gonna hurt my daughter ! Daddy ! Maybe . Daddy ! Daddy ! Doctor ! What 's happening ? Daddy ! Dr Wieder ! You 're killing him ! Stop ! Daddy ! Daddy ! Lynette Peattie 's body is on its way back home to Indiola , West Virginia . She 's going back to her people after all . You know . Mulder , I would 've made the same call ... as a doctor . If I was certain that I couldn 't save her life and she was in that much pain ... I would 've done what Wieder did . It seems pretty clear-cut . Except maybe it 's not . You 're wondering if maybe Peattie could 've saved her life ? You do keep me guessing . I made this .

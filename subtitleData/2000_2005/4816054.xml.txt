 We saw the Earth destroyed . And in a heartbeat , everything and everyone we knew ... was gone . There were five of us . The crew of the space shuttle Odyssey . And we were the only survivors . A mysterious being who called himself The Seeker ... rescued us and sent us back in time . And now we have five years to live over . Five years to discover who or what destroyed the Earth . Five years to stop it from happening again . Next , I 'll have a horse as my wife . That 's much better . Hang on . What is this , Son ? What are you serving ? It 's tortillas , Daddy . Since when do we eat wetback food ? Really . Why can 't we just get a decent burger or something ? I don 't wanna eat this shit . It 's bad enough they come swarming over the border like rats ... to have to be appreciating their food . - You 're so rude . - Come on . - Stop that . - I 'm not eating that shit . Is this possible ? Is this fucking possible ? I guess the story broke . It 's breaking today . Today . Do you realise what you 've done to me ? To my career ? Is that any worse than what you were planning to do to her , Dad ? Antonia Reyes , consorting with terrorists ? Planning to blow up a U.S. Embassy in Mexico ? Do you have any idea what that story did ... will do , to her career ? How could you possibly know that ? I know a lot more than that , Dad . God damn it , Angela . I 'm your father . Yeah , I know . And it 's getting harder and harder to live with that . I don 't need it , I want it . You 're a bookie , not a charitable organisation . You need some more time , you can tack on 22 % compounded weekly . And I think we can both agree that you wouldn 't be half as accommodating . Thank you . Bye . - Hi . - Dr Mendel . What a nice surprise . Yes , it is . Isn 't it ? Maintenance payments in full . I thought I 'd pay early for my unfortunate history of tardiness . I 'm sorry . - It 's never a problem . You know that . - Yes , I do . Yeah . Fine . So , Kurt , I was gonna drop by and see if you were busy tonight . I thought we could get together . Maybe you 'd like to come by for a drink ? Seeing as we 're neighbours and all ... - Yes . Yes . Miss ... - Virginia . Leonard . Yes . Of course . Virginia Leonard . Yeah . We could pop open a bottle of wine or I could pick up some Mexican microbrew ... - and catch the game . - Mexican microbrew . That 's ... I would love to , but it 's my mother 's 70th birthday tonight . I 'm really sorry . Why don 't we make it some other time ? - Sure . - Okay ? Wonderful . Fabulous . - I 'll call you . - Bye . " The Houston scientific community suffered a tragic loss today ... " when one of the nation 's top ... " prosthetic researchers was found dead in his laboratory . " Police are investigating a possible homicide . " Sources tell KNBS news ... " that the victim 's six-year-old niece , Stevie Chapman , has disappeared . " Viewers are urged to contact KNBS Crime Busters tip line ... " with any information about Stevie 's whereabouts . " Don 't go away . Sports and weather are up next . " - Nice save . - " Prosthetecist " ? I 'm not sure our 6 : 00 audience knows ... or cares about something it can 't even pronounce , Chad . You 're the one that 's badgering me to upgrade the broadcast . Yes . I 'm talking about stories , not vocabulary . - You know , having a little journalistic ... - Journalistic integrity ? That 's asking a bit much , don 't you think ? Troy , meet Sarah Forbes . I do . Sarah 's leaving for CNN any day , but until then she 's our 6 : 00 anchor . Troy Johnson , our new news director . - Nice to meet you . - I know your work well . I lived in Detroit when you did the weekend weather . KNBS is lucky to have you . You are creating a monster , you realise that ? And she already thinks she 's Mike Wallace . She 'll be acting like a pit bull the next freeway chase she has to cover . - Miss Forbes ? - Where do I sign ? Seventeen " K. " Not bad for an old man . Old man ? Who are you calling an old man ? Get your ass over here . We 'll do three rounds right now . I 'm so fast you ... Hell , you didn 't even work up a sweat . What the hell is this ? A weight belt ? A little trick I picked up in basic . Psyches out the competition . You wimp . I don 't need a handicap to whip your ass . - I thought the physical was just routine . - Yeah , but you still wanna ace it . - Well , that just leaves the written exam . - How about you , skinny ? When 's the last time you went for a run ? Probably the last time Mom smelt dope in his clothes . Chased him halfway to O 'Reilly 's farm . All right . It 's a pop quiz . Name the top three things they 're looking for in an astronaut . - Number one . - Making survival look easy . Resourcefulness . - Now , how in the hell do you know that ? - Yeah . You been reading this ? Number two , humility . Knowing when to keep your mouth shut . That 's bullshit ! You got something to say in space ... you open up your damn mouth , you say it . Well , that 's funny , Dad . ' Cause I heard ... the old timers really bust your balls for taking initiative . Only if you say something stupid . What do you got here ? A Boy Scout manual ? No . It 's the astronaut selection committee ... " Do 's and Don 'ts . " I got it off the web . How to be an astronaut ? Are you kidding me ? " If you can 't say something nice , still say something nice . " That 's bullshit again . You ain 't got something nice to say , say something rude . Listen , where the hell is my newspaper ? Your mother steal my crossword puzzle again ? I don 't know , Dad . Can 't find shit in this house . It said Louis Chapman was killed by Synthetics . Synthetics . The e-mail said those exact words ? - Yeah . - Hang on a second . First we got Sentients , now we got Synthetics . I mean , I know my ass from my elbow in an aeroplane ... but can you get my head around this shit ? All right , all right . Sentients are computer entities , artificial life forms . Synthetics , or what we call Synthetics ... are physical manifestations . They 're a creation , if you will . Like Tessa . Thank you , Doctor . I think . All right . So you guys , check this out . This appeared on my cell phone screen . It 's omega . A Greek symbol . And from the Book of Revelations , Christ said , " I am Alpha and the Omega . " - The end of days . - The end time . That 's very good , Chuck . You know your Bible . You going to church ? Used to . What , we gotta bring religion into this now ? And what else did he say ? Well , he said that Chapman was killed because of something he was working on . Chapman ? Is this the guy who built prosthetic limbs ? - Yeah . Same guy . - I reported on this . As I recall , Chapman 's name was on Chandra 's computer . Yeah , that 's right . He was on a list of people ... Chandra was keeping track of . So you think Chandra suspected Chapman of consorting with the enemy . Just because you 're paranoid doesn 't mean they aren 't after you . Yeah . Maybe not . But it turns out Chapman was doing more than just prosthetics . He was developing a cybiotic interface . Trying to integrate computer technology with organic systems . Cybiotic interface ? Lmagine if you had a computer chip inside your brain ... to calculate a tip , or spell-check a note , make a cellular phone call ... - all from inside your head . - That is so unnatural . - I know . Isn 't it great ? - It 's fascinating . It 's the wave of the future , or what 's left of it . It also said Chapman lived with a niece who disappeared a few days ago . - She was , like , five or six years old . - And deaf . And apparently the Synthetics are after her because , and I quote ... " She holds the key to their plans . " - You think this e-mail was legit ? - Hell , everything 's legit . Religion is legit , e-mails , Sentients , Aesthetics . - Synthetics . - Whatever . I don 't give a shit if it 's astrology or voodoo . Like the lady said , " Just ' cause you 're paranoid ... " don 't mean they 're not after you . " We gotta find this little deaf girl , and we gotta find her now . I 'll pay the cheque . That 's your Houston local . I 'm Rob Waty . In a stunning setback for three-term senator , Brian Perry ... sources reveal a darker side to the Texas kid . In a news conference today , Perry offered a mea culpa . I can 't erase the past . I can only beg for your forgiveness . I have shamed my family . I have shamed the great state of Texas . And I have shamed our beloved country . Kind of makes you wonder how Reyes got ahold of that tape , huh ? - I know how she got it . - How ? I sent it to her . Don 't worry . He 's already bouncing back . Well , he got you reinstated . That 's something I couldn 't do . Yeah , he did . And he also paid that guy there , to hug him . And he doesn 't speak Spanish at all . No . He 's reading that phonetically off the teleprompter . And he 's about to wage one of the dirtiest campaigns in the history of Texas . I 'm gonna tell you something you can take to the grave . You don 't wanna hear it . Your parents ain 't never gonna be the people you want them to be ... and there 's nothing on God 's earth you can do about it . The lab is on the second floor . Julie will meet you at the elevator . Thank you . There are a dozen tendons and ligaments in a human elbow . Even Third-World countries like Cambodia have sophisticated prosthesis factories . All it takes is a market . In Cambodia , you can thank the five million landmines sitting in the ground . One for every man , woman and child in the country . Yeah , and those crappy odds are the unhappy legacy ... of the Khmer Rouge genocide , right ? You know your Asian history , Commander . American history , hon . About 30 , 40 years ago , the United States fought a war over there ... that was provocative , to say the least . I don 't think we 've ever had a shuttle commander in the lab . - Or a world-famous author . - No . We 've had lots of those . It 's a pretty impressive piece of machinery you got there . Dr Chapman developed chip technology to mimic the body 's natural movement . It 's a huge leap forward in the world of prosthetics . So Dr Chapman was working on cybiotic interface before he died ? I just build the robotics . Well , where the hell is Dr Estes ? It 's getting kind of late . Dr Estes should be back any minute ... and he should be able to fill you in . Pardon me , Julie . Is there a bathroom I can duck into ? - Yeah . In the back , to the left . - Right . Back to the left . Thank you . Tell me why you 're interested in Dr Chapman 's work . Well , it 's only preliminary ... but NASA 's thinking of expanding its robotics programme . See , there 's some people in the agency ... that think that manned space flight 'll soon be a thing of the past . This is a very remarkable invention . I 've been working on this for over a year . - Go ahead . - Go ahead , what ? - Touch it . - What 's it gonna do , bite me ? Touch it . All righty . Jesus ! What in God 's name ? - Dr Estes ? - What ? - Two men came by to see you . - When ? Just a few minutes ago . They 're in the lab with Julie . The market for these things has to be a little bit smaller in the United States ... than it is for Cambodia , right ? Well , only for the unlucky few , industrial accidents , leaf shredders . We 're building a foot for a surfer . A shark bit his clean off . Shit . Jesus . Did I break it ? - Oh , shit . - It 's okay . It 's okay . - Can I just ... - Oh , good . Here he comes . Dr Estes , this is Chuck Taggart from NASA ... and his friend here . Wanted to see you about our robotics research . - What about it ? - Well , we were particularly interested in ... - Dr Chapman 's work on cybiotic interface . - I don 't have time right now . Just leave your number ... and I 'll call you when I have a moment . See them both out . Julie , could I speak to you ? Well , thank you both for your time . Thank you . - Chuck . Chuck . - Yeah . Cochlears have permanently changed our world . But you 'd be surprised . Most deaf parents , not to mention my deaf co-workers , deeply resent them . But how do you tell a child you won 't let them hear ? - So , Stevie can hear ? - Yeah . When she turns her cochlear on . We provide a supportive environment ... for children making the transition to the hearing world . Stevie was always a troubled child . Her parents are gone and her uncle ... Well , let 's just say he was a reluctant parent . So the implant didn 't help at all . It made her more withdrawn . She spent more and more time away from school ... and grew alienated from both worlds . But she did love to draw . Did her uncle say why he was keeping her out of school ? He was some kind of scientist . He seemed very interested in her cochlear . - Too interested , in my opinion . - Too interested ? It was just a feeling , but ... I got the sense that he was tinkering with it . What 's wrong with you ? Don 't you talk ? You some kind of retard ? Maybe that 's why your parents forgot you . I didn 't say you could go . I 'm gonna call the proper authorities . Get my reward . Then I don 't care where the fuck you go , you little worm . You better be worth something , fucking ' tard . - Hey , man . - You went for a run ? - Yeah . Just up to the O 'Reilly farm and back . - What was your time ? Thirty , thirty-five minutes . - Not bad , not bad . - Are you working on an essay test ? Yeah . I 'm trying to get my time down . 500 words , 11 minutes . - You already know the question ? - Oh , educated guess . Why do I wanna become an astronaut ? Really ? I figured it 'd be something more random , like ... " Name a hundred uses for duct tape . " See if you can think on your feet , you know ? Right . You know , you should think about the programme . Straighten up a bit , do a few pushups ... make a good NASA man . Yeah . Hey , don 't forget to memorize the simulator checklist . I hear they always ask that . I 'm sure they realise it was an accident . NASA reinstated you , didn 't they ? - After Dad made them . - Oh , you should be grateful . Chuck Taggart couldn 't even make that happen . It 's humiliating , Mom . It 's worse than being grounded . Now everything I do will be called into question . Oh , I 'm sure it isn 't that bad . Angela , this thing with your father . He 's very upset with you . You 're not being fair . He 's not being fair . To me , to you , to the people who listen and believe in him . He 's a prick , Mom . Angela , he is your father , and that means you owe him your unconditional support . Don 't you mean love , Mom ? Because they are two different things . - He doesn 't deserve to be senator . - Life is not that simple . The Senate is his entire world . He 'd die without it . Listen to yourself . Why do you even care what happens to him ? - He 's my husband . - No . He left you , Mom . And he lied to you , and he cheated on you . He was my husband for 37 years . That means something . Remember when I first met you ? I was totally blown away . I don 't even think I noticed you . - Oh , is that so ? - Yeah . Yeah . I was married , remember ? Hey , I was engaged , right ? Of course , that didn 't last long . Are you saying you think I 'm responsible for breaking up two relationships ? No . I am not . It was all me . I take full blame . We 're gonna be all right , baby . - Think so ? - Yeah , I think so . You know , I 'll never be able to make up for you losing your son like you did ... - but I ... - No . I don 't wanna talk about Corey right now . All right . Dinner . Saturday . You free ? You , me and our significant others . Charlotte 's been dying to meet you ... and if we 're gonna be working together ... we might as well make it more than professional . I 'm sorry . We have plans on Saturday . Pick a night . Any night . We just moved here so the month 's wide open . You know , my son , Corey ... - it 's really hard to find him a baby-sitter ... - We don 't have to go out . Word has it you make a mean gumbo . I don 't even have time to get dressed in the morning , let alone ... You always look great to me . So , you 're telling your new news director ... that there 's not a single night in the next month that you can free up ? Let me talk to Paul . Yeah , Chad . I 'll check it right now . Chad , Chad , Chad ! Wait . Anything more on my prosthetics researcher ? Yeah . He 's still dead . You know , one day you 're gonna really regret ... - not trusting my journalistic instincts , okay ? - I already do . Look , this might be of interest to you . - Another body picked clean . Similar M.O. - Give me that . Now don 't get too excited . Looks like a homeless guy became a buffet for a bunch of rats . Unless it 's a whacko serial killer on the loose , then you got one hell of a story . What would the Synthetics want with a low-life like this ? A further question is , what would want one ? It stinks in here . Who lived here , another scientist ? Well , a very mellow scientist . Probably doing research on his own brain cells . How do you even find somebody in a place like this ? - They probably followed Stevie . - That doesn 't mean they got her . Well , if she got away , then she 's wandering around Montrose alone right now . Yeah . Well , where the hell would she go ? She 's a kid . You 're a kid . Where in the hell would a kid go ? Well , beats me . A circus , the zoo . There ain 't no circus in town . But ... I knew I raised a smart boy . I 'm taking off . The hand should be ready to ship next week . Can 't you see I 'm busy ? Okay , then . Goodnight . I didn 't tell them anything . I swear . I ain 't been to the zoo since you and your brother were in grade school . Think it 's a good idea the way you 're putting the screws to Marc again ? - Putting the screws to him ? - Yeah . Dad , you 're all over him about the Selection Committee . We 've already been down this road . Hasn 't it occurred to you that he just might not have what it takes ? Well , as I recall , it was you who brought up the physical exam ... and it was you who brought up the oral exam ... firing questions back and forth out of the manual . Now how do you get it that I 'm putting the screws to him ? You should be discouraging him . Son , I don 't give a shit what he does . If I were you , I 'd examine my own motives in this here conversation . - My motives . - That 's right . You ever heard of " the only frog in the pond " ? - This is bullshit . - Bullshit , huh ? Let me tell you something . Original tradition of conflict in the history of this planet ... ain 't between fathers and sons , husbands and wives . It 's brothers . I hate the look of caged creatures . Reminds me of my first marriage . - Anything ? - Same old crap . Stevie ? My name 's Neil . Can you hear me ? Is your cochlear on or working ? I really wish I spoke sign , right now . Hey , do you wanna go for a walk ? Are you hungry ? You wanna get something to eat ? - Panda . - Panda . Yeah . Yeah , the panda . You know what ? I think the pandas are asleep already . But maybe we can come back tomorrow . What do you think ? Okay . Okay . Okay . Hey , let 's call someone . Lost and found or something . I believe their entire bureaucracy is devoted to the well-being of spare children . A spare child . Is that like a spare part ? - Call the police . - She won 't be safe at the police , okay ? We can 't exactly warn them against Synthetics . Yeah , no . We don 't know what she knows ... we don 't know why they 're after her , nothing . - The kid stays here . - Wait a minute . Not here , here . Well , I can 't take her . Paul would ask way too many questions . - Yeah . Mom would freak . Sorry . - I have a nosy roommate . For Christ Almighty ! Am I gonna baby-sit this charge indefinitely ? He 's got a point . Kid can 't survive on vodka and paté . - Very funny . - Tell you what . You stay here and baby-sit Daddy-O , and Daddy-O stay here and baby-sit the kid . Daddy-O ? I don 't see Taggart anywhere . I 'll be there in a minute , Mom . I know it 's here . Let 's try the other one then . The science author . - Panda . - Panda . - What is this ? - Friend . Watch out for me . Friends watch out for you . - Friend . - Friends . - Your turn , Kurt . - My turn ? - Friends . - All right . Friends . Hi . How are you ? - I 'm impressed . - I 'm impressed . I have many hidden talents . Hi . Hi . My name is Kurt . What is your name ? - Stevie . - Stevie ? Hi , Stevie . You have cochlear , darling . Why don 't you turn it on ? My friends don 't need it . But if your friends don 't need it , they must be nice friends . Could you get that , darling ? Kurt . Bedtime . Hello ? Bedtime . You 're gonna have to help me on this one . I 'm not very experienced . You and Kurt sit tight with the little one . Neil and Angela and I are gonna go over to that lab . We 're gonna pick that place apart . Meanwhile , you just sit tight . - Call you later . Give you a heads up . - Very good . Okay ? A song ? What song ? Like a Britney Spears ' song ? - Shoo Fly . - Shoo Fly . Okay . Shoo Fly . But you have to sign , but you have to sing , as well . Okay ? - We 're just putting her to bed right now . - One , two , three . Shoo fly , don 't bother me Shoo fly , don 't bother me Shoo fly , don 't bother me I belong to somebody Very good , very good . Excellent . What next ? Is there some kind of good-night handshake ? Thank you . Thank you . - Thank you . - Nice bedside manner . I hope I can trust on your discretion . All right . Bedtime . - Come . - No ! Sorry , sorry . Okay , well , I suppose we can leave the light on ... but only because you impressed me so much with your singing . Okay ? Sarah . Oh , God . What is that ? Stevie ? They 're my friends . They 're your friends ? Thank you . - Commander Chuck Taggart . - Yes . NASA 's got you working the night shift now . Yeah . Let 's try the obvious . Very good . Angela , take this all , this here place apart . - Neil , you got that crowbar ? - Yeah . Come with me . Chuck ? Interesting . If I 'm not mistaken ... that thing implanted on his back is some sort of micro-processor . Uncle Lou . Your uncle put the chip on the back of the ants ... so the computer could tell them what to do ? Fascinating . It 's the next step in cybiotic interface . Last year they grafted a chip on the back of a cockroach and made it turn right . And this year we have a swarm of computer-controlled , man-eating driver ants . Progress , darling . Computer-controlled bugs ? That cannot be good . - It 's all I can find . - Well , what 's with the hard drives ? Is the hard drive fried ? Are you gonna try to resurrect something here ? - Just try to get something ... - Dad ! - What ? - The database is gone . The hard drive 's nearly wiped out . Let me see if I can get something off the processor chip , okay ? Stevie 's cochlear acts as a transmitter . The ants could have formed some kind of spontaneous telemetric link . There are many cases in the natural world of two distinct species ... evolving a symbiotic relationship ... or inventing a whole new form of communication . It 's fascinating . And maybe this isn 't Dr Chapman 's work . Maybe it 's a freak of nature . Not you , darling . Her teacher said Chapman was experimenting with her cochlear . Well , the telemetric link was formed ... the doctor improved it , and he was eaten by it . The classic scientific parable . Stevie ... the ants , they killed your uncle , didn 't they ? But were they mad at him ? Was he not nice to them ? But you were nice to them . Is that why the ants do tricks for you ? So , did the computer tell the ants ... to kill your uncle ? He want to kill them ... so they wouldn 't hurt anyone . Your uncle thought they would hurt people ? But they hurt him first ... and I yelled , " Stop ! " - But they wouldn 't stop . - Yeah . Chuck ! Wait , wait , wait ! It 's me . It 's me . It 's me . It 's Chuck Taggart . It 's me . Julie , Julie . Julie ! These two men came in , and they didn 't see me . - They killed Dr Estes . - Okay , okay , okay . They 're gone . They 're gone now . They 're gone now . It 's okay . Okay . - They kept talking about this girl . - What girl ? I don 't know , some girl . They think that you have her . They 're looking for you , for you and your family . Jesus Christ . I can 't get a signal in here . Shit . Let 's get out of here . Come on . Stevie , are you afraid of them ? They 're my friends , but they won 't listen . Friends can be that way . Stevie , where did the ants go ? To bed . - To bed ? - They went to bed ? - Hello ? - Kurt , there 's two men . They know we got the little girl . They killed Dr Estes . They 're on the way to your place . Shit . They found us . Hello ? A drink ? Sure . Does it have to be right now ? Yeah . Okay . Just hang on . I 'm so sorry . I promise I can explain . - Fire escape . Where 's your fire escape ? - Rear window . Can I make this up to you ? Dinner and a movie , my treat ? Yes . - Lf I live through this day , I will call you . - Okay . Stevie . Oh , shit . Get in the van . Now ! - Just go . - Move it ! Go , go ! Hang on , y 'all . It 'll be all right . Call your friend . Came through . - Yeah . - Neil . - Dad , it 's Kurt . - Hang up . - Fucking ... Damn it ! - Damn it . - Yeah . - Neil , you tell your fucking father ... that at the present moment , I 'm the most disposable part of this equation . A very nice gentleman has a semi-automatic pointing at my fucking head ! Dad , he says they 're gonna shoot him . Tell him to back the fuck off . Now . He 's pointing a gun at Stevie . Shit , Dad . He says they 're gonna shoot Stevie . He 's got a gun , they 're gonna shoot her ! Come on ! Neil , tell you moron of a father to back off ! Shit . Damn it . What the hell ? I can 't get them off . What the hell ! Go on , get the door ! They all right ? You guys okay ? Come on , come on , get them out . Come on , get them out of there . - Kurt , you all right ? - Come on , come on , come on . Watch your head . - Go , go , go ! - No , no ! Oh , no ! - No ! Panda ! - Run ! Well , at least we have two less Synthetics to worry about . I hate to break it to you , but these were not Synthetics ... unless Synthetics can now bleed . - What in the hell were they then ? - Human beings . Working with the Synthetics ? Or they could be working against them . It 's impossible to be sure . Maybe your little e-mail buddy was one of them . - Of which ? - Of which whatever it was ... I think you 'll be hearing from them again . And by the way , Sarah , how 's Stevie ? Is she okay ? She got there okay . I mean , I don 't know her exact location , but she 's as safe as she can be . I got news for all you all . Ain 't nobody safe . Well , it must be something good ... 'cause you ain 't stood in the driveway waiting for me ... since I brought you home a bicycle . What the hell is this ? " Dear Marc Taggart . We are pleased to inform you ... " you have passed the first round of NASA examinations ... " and are now eligible to proceed . " I 'll be damned . - Well , it just gets me to the next round . - Well , that 's one round closer . Get in . I 'll buy you a beer . Hey , you know , Neil was right . They asked the weirdest question about duct tape . Sometimes I think that guy 's smarter than he looks . Well , with that hair , he ought to be . So we 're walking along the beach in Waikiki on our honeymoon . Okay , full moon , endless sand , no one in sight . Okay ? Sarah is whispering about the dress her cousin Charlene wore to the wedding . She 's afraid that somebody 's going to hear her . Now listen to this . I couldn 't hear her ... so you can damn well be sure ... that her cousin Charlene couldn 't hear her all the way back in Detroit . - Well , better than this big mouth here . - What ? Wait you have at least one cousin who 's not speaking to you at the moment . She got these awful extensions , okay ? And I 'm just ... She should thank me for telling her the truth . Remember when I first met you ? I was totally blown away . Sometimes the truth is better left unsaid . You 're one to talk . You 're just like Ben . How do you know my father 's name ? Would you like some pie ? I never knew the IRS could be so aggressive . Well , you know , you steal a billion , you 're a genius ... and you fudge a tax return ... I could 've sworn one of them had a gun . That was just for show , you know ? - What 's that ? - Chocolate malt Lambic . I got the recipe off the Internet . I used to mull my own wine , so I figured why not try my own microbrew . I made some Swiss Mocha Almond for dessert . Chocolate beer . Very interesting . You can put all kinds of things in beer . Hot peppers , marshmallows . Marshmallows and hot peppers . Kidding . - Try keeping that down . - Right . That 's just strangely refreshing . - See ? I told you you 'd have a good time . - I never doubted it for a second . So , who was that cute little girl you were with ? Oh , Stevie ? She was cute , wasn 't she ? Got you . You 're it . One , two , three ... four , five ... - Hi . ... six , seven . - Got you . You 're it . - Darn . One , two , three , four , five , six ... seven , eight , nine , ten . Ready or not , here I come .

[ Applause ] [ Joanna ] We will be right there as happily married couples are flown first class to a tropical island paradise , where they will be completely surrounded by professional prostitutes . And at the end of the week ... Well , let 's take a peek . It 's been a week and Hank , our personnel manager from Omaha , has spent the entire seven days with Vanessa , our call girl and exotic dancer . Yeah , it 's been amazing . And I 'll admit we 've had some fun in the hot tub , and all . But do you want to know something ? All we did was talk . Because I love my wife . And the only place I want to be is back in Omaha with my Barbara . Tough break , Nessa . Barbara , you spent Monday with Rocky , our body-builder and male escort , Tuesday through Thursday with the entire cast of the Triple X film Hung Jury , and you spent the entire weekend with Tonkiro . Now it 's time for the final decision . Barbara , it 's yours to make . Is it gonna be Omaha ? Or Omahunks ? Well ... Before I came on this show , I only had sex with one man , and that was usually Hank . I love Hank deeply and forever with all my heart , and I would never do anything to hurt him . But I can do better ! [ Cheering ] The battle of the sexes ! As old as time but as current ... [ Hank ] Why ? Uh , excuse me ? Why did you do it ? Oh , my God ! It 's Hank from I Can Do Better . Hank , everyone ! No , stop it ! I love Barbara . I had a family . I had a life . Hank , I know it hurts . Love isn 't easy . Relationships aren 't easy , not for anyone . But now you know the truth about Barbara . You are gonna move on with your life and you 're gonna meet someone wonderful , and America is gonna love you . - [ Woman ] Yes . - [ Cheering , applause ] [ Woman ] Whoo ! Yeah . I got a great idea for another hot new show . - [ Joanna ] Tell it to us . - It 's called ... - Let 's Kill All The Women . - [ Woman ] He 's got a gun ! Oh , my God ! - [ Screaming ] - [ Shattering ] - Oh . - Joanna , are you all right ? I am great , raring to go . The police were sensational . - And not a scratch . [ chuckles ] - You haven 't heard . About what ? - That man Hank . - [ Sighs ] Right before he tried to kill you , he went to see his ex-wife and five of her new boyfriends . - He did ? - He shot all of them . The wife is in critical condition and four guys are on life-support . - Tonkiro ? - He 's fine . - Thank God . - So you know what this means . Of course . We pay for their medical treatment , every penny , we get them the very best therapists , childcare , rehab , whatever they need . We fly them to New York , first class , for a primetime special : Hank and Barbara : Let The Healing Begin . You 're not listening . We can 't wear this . The lawsuits alone may bankrupt the network . All your new shows , the whole line-up , the affiliates won 't touch them . We have shareholders . We can 't let you sink the network . But we wish you only the best . Of course . Thank you for being so classy and taking this so well . Joanna , we just wanted to say that this is so not fair . [ Elevator rings ] Good-bye , everybody !

The doctors say there 's a lot of work to do , but you 're going to be just fine . And Pete made this for you . - That 's so sweet . - Isn 't it ? And I wanted you to know that , the minute I heard the news , I called the network and I quit . - You did that for me ? - Of course . I know I was only a vice president , but I could never work for those people . Not after the way they treated you . - Walter . - Do you remember what today is ? It 's our anniversary . Oh , Walter . I 'm so sorry . Maybe that man who tried to shoot me , maybe he was right . Maybe I 've become the wrong kind of woman . Maybe I 've made all of the wrong decisions . Could we get away and start over ? And get it right , our marriage ? - But why are we moving ? - To Connecticut ? We 're moving so we can all kick back and have a great new life in this beautiful new town . [ Birds chirping ] - Name ? - Kresby . - Welcome to Stepford . - Thanks . - What do you think , guys ? - Good . Honey ? Hello , everyone . I 'm Mrs. Wellington . Welcome to Stepford . I 'm with Stepford Realty . We spoke on the phone . - You must be Walter . - So nice to meet you in person . And the little ones . I bet you 're Pete . - Duh . - Pete . - He 's every bit as handsome as his dad . - Thank you . Kimberly ! Aren 't you just the cutest little bug 's ear ? Bugs don 't have ears . Isn 't she sassy ? And a little sad . And this must be Joanna . - Electro-shock ? - But she 's doing great . Hello , little Energizer . The minute Walter called , I knew this was the perfect house for you . It 's the top of the line , here at Stepford Estates , and it 's got everything an American family could ever need . - And may I present to you ... - [ Kimberly ] Look at this ! - This is amazing ! - The Great Room . I call it cozy . And it 's also a smart house . Now this controls the security system . - [ Computer ] All secure . - It talks to the refrigerator . [ Computer ] We need juice . The system also monitors all the commodes , where it will test your urine for blood sugar , protein and body fat . - [ Computer ] Flush toilets . - [ Toilets flushing ] Isn 't that great , kids ? - I 'm gonna go check my room ! - Me , too ! - Now , Walter , will you be commuting ? - No . No . Joanna and I both left the network . - [ Barking ] - [ Mrs. Wellington ] Look , the puppy . Robo Rover 3000 . Come on , boy , come on !

It was founded by George Washington and Martha just loved it . Stepford is Connecticut 's family paradise . It has no crime , no poverty and no pushing . What is that ? Up on the hill ? That 's our Stepford Men 's Association , where all our wonderful guys can get together and stay out of our hair . Am I right ? - Where do the women go ? - To the Simply Stepford Day Spa . Good morning , ladies . [ All ] Good morning , Claire . I would like you all to welcome our newest citizen to Stepford . - Joanna . - [ All ] Good morning , Joanna . - Are we ready to work out ? - [ All ] Oh , yes ! Places and poles , please . Wait . You work out dressed like this ? Well , of course . Whatever we do , we always want to look our very best . I mean , why imagine if our husbands saw us in worn , dark , urban sweat clothes , with stringy hair and almost no make-up . [ Woman ] Oh , good heavens . Now , today you are in for a special treat . Because we are working on a series of exercises which I personally invented , based on simple , household tasks . I call my program Claireobics . Because her name is Claire .

[ indistinct chatter ] [ Man ] Hear ye , hear ye ! Come one , come all . And happy Fourth of July . At 1 : 30 will be the children 's Stars and Stripes face-painting ... Isn 't this great ? A real , old-fashioned town picnic . You can 't get this in Manhattan . Which is why we 'll stay 10 minutes , make an appearance and get out of here . Kids , I 'm really sorry about this , but let 's try and have fun . - Mom , it 's a picnic . - Chill . Go ahead , have fun . - Ten minutes ? - Walter , you just don 't get it . These women are deranged , flight attendant-friendly . - They 'll be all over me . - [ Woman ] Joanna ! Here we go . - Hi , Joanna ... - Hi . - Hi , Walter . - Hi . - You look great . - I love you in khakis . They 're new . A little experiment . Now I know why they call it Banana Republic . [ All giggling ] [ Woman ] Excuse me ! Excuse me . Excuse me , ladies . Excuse me . Excuse me . Excuse me . Excuse me ! Am I the only one who finds all of this disturbing ? We 're celebrating our nation 's birthday . But there are no African Americans , no Native Americans , no Asian Americans ... Oh , my God ! Hey . You 're Joanna Eberhart . You got such a raw deal . Aren 't you Bobbie Markowitz ? I love your books . Especially the last one , about your relationship with your mother . - I Love You , But Please Die . - [ Man ] Hey , baby . Baby , look what I did .

That place . - Finish the laundry ? - I finished a chapter . - Did you make sandwiches ? - Did you ? - Where are the kids ? - What kids ? - Are you two OK ? - [ Both ] We 're fine . - Come on , I need a cookie . - See what I mean ? Jerry , it 's a bake sale . An actual bake sale . It 's like some sort of heavenly diorama at the Smithsonian , in the Hall of Homemakers . Oh , no . Stop it . Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop it ! - That is not cobbler ! - Roger ... Could we reel it in a couple of hundred yards ? How do you keep your figures ? Is there a huge vat of cobbler vomit somewhere ? But worth it ? - Roger ? - I 'm sorry . - That is ... - It 's fabulous . - Jerry thinks that I overdo everything . - [ Joanna ] Excuse me . - Aren 't you Roger Bannister ? - The amazing architect , from The Times ? - Thank you .

[ Man ] Mike 's here . - Mike ! - Do-si-do , do-si-do . - [ Walter ] Mike . - It 's OK . I 'm here . Walt , the missus . - Jo . - The missus ? Walter , what is your problem ? I 'm ... Hey ! [ Joanna ] Uh , excuse ... [ Joana stammering ] - [ Electrical charge ] - What was that ? Herb , Dave , give me a hand and get Sarah right into my Hummer . - Your Hummer ? - [ Dave ] It 's a sweet ride . - It 's roomy . - We need an ambulance . You shouldn 't be moving her . She might need oxygen , paramedics ... - Everything isn 't always about you . - Walter . She 'll be fine . It 's too much sun , she 's dehydrated . Dehydrated ? Are you crazy ? - Jo ! Sorry about this , Mike . - Joanna ... This is a very special moment . I would like you to meet ... - Mike Wellington . - My husband . - Oh . - You must be the famous Joanna . You 're even prettier than in the newspapers . That woman is very sick . I should be going with her . She 'll get all the help she needs . Trust me , little lady . That woman had a seizure and she was practically levitating . I have told you five million times , I phoned Herb . He said that Sarah is fine , she just needed some fluids , like Mike said . - She was sparking . - She was dancing . Why wasn 't there a doctor ? - And why ... - The kids . Oh ! Why ? Walter . Walter . Why did everyone automatically listen to that Mike person ? Why was everyone standing there ? You mean , why weren 't they listening to you ? - That 's not what I 'm saying ! - Jesus Christ , Joanna . - What ? - You were fired . Your kids barely know you and our marriage is falling apart . Your attitude makes people want to kill you . It makes people try to kill you . That 's what we 're doing here . The people in this town have been nothing but friendly and welcoming and wonderful to you . And you 've been nothing but snide and suspicious . And at the picnic , you humiliated me . Well , I can 't do it anymore . I can 't keep fighting you for every inch of everything . Game over . Marriage over . No ! - No ! - No , what ? - Please don 't go . - Why not ? Because you 're right . Wait , I 'm sorry . I don 't think I heard that . What did you just say ? - I said , " You 're right . " - About ? About everything . Oh . About me . You know why I signed on at the network ? Cos I thought that if I was around , I could help you lighten up . - You did ? - Yeah , I did . What was that one show called ? I Can Do Everybody . See , that 's what I mean . I wanted to make you laugh . That 's so sweet , but I ... I was busy , I was running a network , Walter . You were so busy that we haven 't made love in over a year . - I know . - Well , I miss you . But I 've always loved you so much , I ... You know that . Why ? Because . Because ... you 're goofy and you 're ... you 're handsome and you 're ... You 're my Walter . And because when you play computer chess , you do that little ... victory dance . - I do not . - [ Chuckling ] Yes , you do . No , I don 't . Mm-hmm . If I 'm not the smartest , and the best of the best , and the most successful , then I don 't know , who am I ? Do you want to find out ? How ? First of all , we 're in the country now , so no more black . - No more black ? Are you insane ? - You heard me . Only high-powered , neurotic , castrating Manhattan career bitches wear black . Is that what you want to be ? Ever since I was a little girl . Do I really look OK ? Can I be honest ? - You look kinda like Betty Crocker . - I know . - At Betty Ford . - [ Computer ] We need milk . Thank you . I 'm trying to make an effort to change . Last night , my husband was a different person . He was strong , he was forceful . - He was commanding . - Like your refrigerator . Nobody said it was going to be easy , being a homemaker and a stay-at-home mom . It 's the toughest job in the world , right ? That may be , but these Stepford women , they 're a whole other dimension . Like yesterday . That poor lady , Sarah Sunderson . Walter said she 's fine . You said she shot off sparks from her ears . - That 's the first sign . - Of what ? Cheap jewellery . - We should go see her . - Why ? Because we need to be supportive . That 's how people behave outside of Manhattan . They care about each other . In New York , if one of your neighbours got sick , what would you do ? - Call her . - To see if she 'd die . - So we could get the apartment . - Let 's go . Up ! Up ! Up ! [ Knocking ] Sarah ? Yoo-hoo . - Is she in there ? - Roger ! - It 's open . - That 's amazing . - That 's so sweet . - And so trusting . - Roger . - Look at this place . Sarah ? Sarah ? [ Sarah moaning ] Oh , Herb ! Roger ! [ Sarah ] Oh , Herb ! Oh , yes ! Oh , yes ! - Make me beg ! - [ Herb ] Yeah ! [ Sarah ] I 'm so lucky ! - Oh , my God ! - Is that a DVD ? No , it 's them . [ Sarah ] Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! You 're the king ! Yes ! [ High-pitched screaming ] Oh ! I 'm going up there . - Why ? - I want some . Roger ! - [ Chuckling ] - Sssh . - [ Herb ] Baby , grab me some nachos . - [ Sarah ] Yes , dear . [ Joanna ] We should get out of here ! What 's this ? - Roger , put it down . - What ? Oh , come on . [ Roger ] Why does it say " Sarah " ? Put it down . Let 's get out of here . This is not right . - Roger , come on . - [ Bobbie ] For God 's sake ! - We 're trespassing ! - [ Joanna ] We have to get out of here . - OK , it 's totally useless . - Come on , we have to go ! [ Loud thud ] - Oh , my God . - Hurry , hurry , hurry . [ All laughing ] [ Bobbie ] I can 't believe we did that . I 'm so embarrassed . - I 'm mortified . I 'm famished . - [ Gasps ] - [ Joanna ] Bobbie ! - Yeah ? Are you making anthrax ? Excuse me ? I 've been busy . My new book . But can 't you hire someone to clean ? Someone brave ? Dave says I gotta do it myself , like Sarah Sunderson . - Could you believe her ? - Darling , her home is spotless . And she 's having incredible sex in the middle of the day with her husband . I 'm sorry , but my shrink says I need creative chaos . My therapist says I need boundaries . My doctor said I need enough electricity to jump-start Vegas . - Have you ever done Zoloft ? - Kid 's stuff . Xanax . I worship Xanax . I 'm old-fashioned . I like Prozac with a Viagra chaser . You 're up and you 're up ! - Oh , Roger . - Viagra ! [ Chuckles ] Hey , is there something that you need to tell us ? [ Roger ] Well ... Sharing ! OK . Jerry and I have been at couples counselling , for over a year . And finally , I just couldn 't take it anymore . I howled , " You 've became a gay Republican . " And he said , " What 's wrong with that ? " I said , " That 's like wanting to be gay with a bad haircut . " Exactly . The counsellor suggested we move to the ' burbs . - To find a balance . - We moved here as a last resort . Court order . Don 't ask . [ Joanna ] OK . I know this is unthinkable , but what if we could actually learn how to be happy ? Without Paxil , or compulsive over-eating . What if we gave this whole thing a try ? For real . The whole Stepford thing . [ Indistinct chatter ] Whoo ! Hey , yeah ! Only one can survive . [ All chanting ] Zeus ! Zeus ! Zeus ! Let 's go , baby . Rip her bra off ! - Yeah ! - [ All cheering ] Zeus rules the universe ! And Ted owes Walter 20 big ones . - Ah ! To be a man ! - Whoo ! - Ah . - [ Mike ] So , Walt . You and Stepford . It seems like a real match . I 'll say . I mean , the town and the houses . This place . It 's like a dream . It 's like ... the way life was meant to be . And all of your wives . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . They 're so ... So , um ... Sweet ? Sizzlin ' ? - Superfine . - [ All chuckling ] Well ... We are all so thrilled to be here at the Stepford Book Club , I can 't tell you . Now , I 've just finished the third volume of Robert Caro 's Life of Lyndon Johnson , and I am dying for the next installment . Well , that 's all marvellous . But today we are going to discuss ... Well , it is probably the most important book any of us will ever read . Yes , it is provocative , but it is also inspiring . The Heritage Hill Special Edition Golden Deluxe Treasury of Christmas Keepsakes and Collectibles . [ Gasping ] This book said to me , " Let 's celebrate the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ - " with yarn . " - [ Gasping ] Yarn . Now , Bobbie , we realise you 're probably feeling a bit uncomfortable with this week 's book , because you 're ... - What 's the word I 'm looking for ? - New ? - Scared ? - Cranky ? - Jewish . - Same thing . But the Heritage Hill series is very inclusive . In fact , there is a whole chapter about Chanukah . I just loved the chapter on pine cones . They 're not just for wreaths and centrepieces . You can use pine cones to create a very special Yuletide menorah . Your pine cone snowman could be Jewish , just add a beanie . Or maybe I could use hundreds of pine cones to spell out the words , " Big Jew " in letters 15 feet tall in the snow on my front yard . - That 's a wonderful idea . - [ All chuckling ] - That 's fantastic . - [ Woman ] So sweet ! I love the idea of creating a life-size Santa Claus all out of pine cones . OK , I love that . I 'm going to use a pine cone in my Nativity as the baby Jesus . I 'm going to attach a pine cone to my vibrator and have a really Merry Christmas . Oh . # Here comes Santa Claus Right down Santa Clause Lane # He 's got a bag that 's filled with toys For boys and girls again # Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle Oh , what a beautiful sight # So jump in bed , cover up your head Santa Claus comes tonight ! - # Santa Claus comes tonight # - [ woman ] Oh ! [ Laughing ] - Joanna , how 's she fitting in ? - Well ... OK . - I 'm among friends , right ? - Of course . [ Walter ] So ... Joanna and I had this big talk . And we were really open with each other , I mean ... We really got it all out . And I think from now on , she 's going to be very , very different . [ Laughing quietly ] You think Joanna 's really going to change ? Yes , I do . Absolutely . And how long have you been married ? [ All laughing ] - Ted . - Yes ? Don 't you owe Walter $ 20 ? That 's absolutely right , I do . Babe ! Yes , darling ? Walt , sit down . I need 20 . - You know my PIN . - Of course . [ Beeping ] She gives singles . [ Gradual laughter ] - [ Beep ] - [ Powering off ] - [ Birds chirping ] - [ Bell rings ] [ Joanna ] Ah . Are these all for day camp tomorrow ? - I want you to be proud of me , honey . - [ Robot dog barking ] - [ Peter ] Watch this . - [ Bell rings ] - Ball . - [ Barks ] - Aren 't robots cool ? - Oh , yeah . May I speak to the man of the house ? - Stud bud ! - Funkmaster Markowitz ! - Stone Cold Thrilla Killa Kresbo ! - Cupcakes anyone ? - Cupcakes ! - Cupcakes . Right on time . Jo , these are smokin ' . Why don 't you make stuff like this ? - Why don 't you ? - Because I have a penis . - We should get moving . - We 've got a meeting . - At the Men 's Association . - When will you be home , honey ? When I 'm home . Call a sitter ! - [ Crickets chirping ] - [ Croaking ] [ Joanna ] Bobbie , are you sure about this ? [ Bobbie ] We 're not spying . We 're just visiting . Fellas , I can 't tell you how happy we are to welcome all of this new blood . - [ Man ] You said it . - [ Man # 2 ] That 's right . [ Roger ] I love , love this space . It 's very Ralph Lauren meets Sherlock Holmes . - It says , " I have taste and a scrotum . " - You promised . - Whore . - Bore . - Sorry . - No , Jerry . You 're gonna find Stepford is very open-minded . We welcome you and your partner just like any other couple . - Absolutely . - Sure . - That 's right . - Girlfriend . [ Chuckling ] Miss ... Miss Thing . - To Stepford ! - [ All ] Stepford ! [ Indistinct chatter ] Damn ! Come on , let 's go . You think this is all right , sneaking around ? Add it up . All the women around here are perfect sex kitten bimbos . All the men are drooling nerds . Doesn 't that seem strange ? - Not to me . - Why not ? - I work in television . - Oh , come on . I think Joanna 's right . I think Stepford is the answer . - She 's a great gal . - Or she will be . [ Thumping ] - [ Coughing ] - [ Straining ] [ Bobbie ] Come on , help me up . - [ Joanna ] We shouldn 't be here . - Oh , come on . - Don 't be such a chicken . - I should be home with my cupcakes . Why ? Because you only made 5,000 of them ? - We 're trespassing . - Only if we get caught . - Damn , I can 't see a thing . - Oh . - There 's the light , there it is . - No , Bobbie ... It 's like some alien freak show . Why ? They 're just family portraits . That 's what I said . [ Footsteps approaching ] The lights ! - We should get out of here . - Sssh . [ Joanna panting ] - Should we run ? - Sssh . Oh , my God . [ Floor creaking ] - [ Imitating Hannibal Lecter ] Clarice ? - [ Whimpering ] - Hi , girls ! - Roger ! - You scared us ! - What are you doing ? What 's going on ? Do they have hookers , or old Playboys or cable porn ? Oh , please , they barely have throw pillows . They 're coming ! The menfolk . - Call us . - OK . [ Mike ] Rog ? What was it ? Did you see anyone ? Not a soul . But what 's back here , anyway ? In all of these rooms ? Storage ? Sweaters ? Bodies ? - Jerry . - You see that door on your left ? Check it out . Oh , boy . - I can 't see anything , it 's dark . - Use your flashlight . I feel like Nancy Drew in The Mystery of the Mid-life Crisis . - What am I looking for ? - Look down . [ Laughs nervously ] Jerry ? Roger ! - Roger . - Bobbie . - Roger . - Bobbie . Roger ! Roger said there was nothing going on at the Men 's Association . [ Bobbie ] Why doesn 't he answer the phone ? It 's been two days . Roger . Roger ! Isn 't that his favourite shirt ? The Dolce Gabbana ? His Guccis . And the Versace . - Maybe he 's donating . - To what ? The gay homeless ? He loved this . His program from Hairspray . - Oh , my God . - What is it ? Viggo ! [ Band plays ] Thank you , ladies and gentlemen . I 'm Jerry Harmon . I know I 'm pretty new here , but already I feel so at home . Why did Jerry ask us to meet him here ? ... proud that I can introduce Stepford 's brand new candidate for state senate . Ladies and gentlemen , I give you Mr. Roger Bannister ! What ? He 's wonderful . [ Roger ] Thank you . Thank you so much . You may very well ask , what are my qualifications for higher office ? I believe in Stepford , America and the power of prayer . Values I 've discovered , thanks to my partner , in life and in the Lord , Jerry Harmon . Roger ! Roger ! Yes , is there a question ? Mrs. Markowitz . - So you two are happy now ? - More than ever . Because now I know being gay doesn 't mean a guy has to be effeminate or flamboyant or sensitive . - I 'm no sissy . - No ! Way to go , Roger ! - Roger ! - Yes , Mrs. Walter Kresby . I don 't understand . You were out there , you were Roger , and now ... You 're different . Your hair , your clothes . You 're like someone else . - People change . - You can 't stop Stepford ! You can 't stop Stepford ! [ Crowd chanting ] You can 't stop Stepford ! You can 't stop Stepford ! You can 't stop Stepford ! You can 't stop Stepford ! You can 't stop Stepford ! You can 't stop Stepford ! You can 't stop Stepford ! That 's why we have to leave Stepford ? I 'm not following . OK . Before , Roger was witty , and stylish and ironic . - And I 'm sure he still is . - No ! Now he 's making speeches in a Brooks Brothers suit . There 's lots of ways to be gay . Don 't try to make him into a stereotype . Bobbie is right . And she 's leaving too . This place does something to people . All of the women are always busy , and perfect and smiling . - All the men are always happy . - And that 's a problem because ... ? Because it 's not normal . It 's not the world . It 's not us . And I 'm picking up our kids from camp right now and we 're getting out of here . [ Sighs ] With or without you . - [ Computer ] Secure . - [ Screams ] [ Walter ] You 'll never change , will you ? Not really . Open the door . [ Computer ] Unlock front . And you 're right . About what ? If you 're that unhappy , then we should move . Maybe head back to the city . We could leave tomorrow . Thank you . Thank you . [ Dog whimpering ] Huh ? What you got there ? Huh ? - [ Walter ] Sweetcakes ? - [ Gasps ] It 's 4 : 00 am . What are you up to ? Just recipes for tomorrow . I 'd like to get a head start . - On what ? - Apple pie . Bobbie recommended it . I 'll be right up . Walter ? Babe ? Bobbie ? Bobbie ! Oh , my God . Bobbie ? Good morning , Joanna . Isn 't it a lovely morning ? That 's a pretty colour . - Mom ! - Good morning , my precious ones . And thank you for leaving your requests on my e-mail . Adam , you wanted peanut butter and jelly , no crusts , a Snickers bar and a Rolex . Ben , here 's a whole-wheat burrito , a soy protein shake and three pieces of German chocolate layer cake . - From scratch ? - Of course . And Max , you get bacon , lettuce and tomato on a lightly-toasted bagel . - What about my action figures ? - There 's Mace Windu and Amidala . - Where 's Boba Fett ? - They were out . - Mom ! - Here 's $ 500 . All right . Bye , Mom . Bye , Joanna . They grow up so fast . I think I 'll have three more . Bobbie , listen to me . What have they done to you ? What have they done to you ? Is it drugs ? Is it brain-washing ? - Come on , talk to me . - Of course , but only for a minute . Then I have to get to work on this pigsty . - Coffee ? - No . No coffee . Bobbie , last night I went online . I found out that all of the women here used to be big deals . I mean , big deals . CEOs , executives , judges . Sarah Sunderson , she used to run an airline . With that perfect skin ? No ! She didn 't use to look like that . None of the women did ... - Coffee ? - No ! No coffee ! Bobbie . Bobbie . - This isn 't you . - That 's right , Joanna . This isn 't me . It 's a whole new me . I 'm happy and I 'm healthy because I understand what 's important in life . Yes , your new book . That 's what 's important . My new cookbook . And my husband , and my family , and making a perfect home . It 's a lesson every gal needs to learn , especially you . I 'm your friend , Joanna . I 'm going to help you . - You need me . - Stay away from me . - You 're driven . - Sometimes . And you 're selfish . - You want to rule the world . - No . I can fix you . I can change you . What have they done to you ? Let 's get busy . Answer the phone . Hello . Is this the day camp ? Oh . Yes , this is Joanna Eberhart . I would like to speak to my children . I 'm coming to pick them up right now . What ? Walter ! Walter , where are you ? I know you 've got the kids . Pete ? Kimberly ? [ Panting ] [ Gasps ] [ Thunder ] Oh , boys ! Welcome . - Where are my children ? - They 're perfectly safe . Where are my children ? - You 'll see them soon . - Where 's Walter ? How could you do this ? Ever since we met , you 've beaten me at everything . You 're better educated , you 're stronger , you 're faster , you 're a better dancer , a better tennis player . You 've always earned at least six figures more than I could ever dream of . You 're a better speaker , a better executive . You 're even better at sex . Don 't deny it . I wasn 't going to . - Well , don 't I get anything ? - You got me . No , I got to hold your purse . I got to tell the kids that you 'd be late again . I got to tell the press that you had no comment . - I got to work for you . - With me . Under you ! All of us . We married Wonder Women . Supergirls . Amazon queens . You know what that makes us ? Smart . Worthy . Lucky . We 're the wuss . The wind beneath your wings . Your support system . - We 're the girl . - And we don 't like it ! - You 're damn right . - We 're men . And is this your answer ? To kill us ? No , nothing like that . We help you . We perfect you . By turning us into robots ? Does any fraction of these women still exist ? Of course . Almost everything . - Should we show her ? - Show me what ? It 's a promotional thing I 've been working on for when we go global . Walt , I don 't think you 've seen this . Some guys ask , " How do we do it ? " In layman 's terms , it 's really pretty simple . Come on along . First , we take a gloomy , dissatisfied woman . Then in a very private experience between husband and wife , he gently places her in our Female Improvement System . It 's fully automated . And then , abracadabra , her transformation begins . First , we locate her brain . We insert a few nano-chips . Then we program them . Also we add some secret special ingredients . To avoid any accidents , the husband is kept at a comfortable distance . Safety first . Finally , we enhance her to fit the ideal Stepford wife specifications . And voilà ! Everything is copacetic ! Welcome to the future . - [ Dave ] It 's a painting again . - What ? I should explain . You see , my real name isn 't Mike . It 's just a nickname from where I used to work . Where ? - Microsoft . - NASA . - Disney . - AOL . - Is that why the women are so slow ? - Joanna . Is this what you really want ? Women who behave like slaves ? Women who are obsessed with cleaning their kitchens and doing their hair . Women who never challenge you in any way . Women who exist only to wait on you hand and foot . - [ Man ] Yeah . - [ Man # 2 ] That 's right . You 're a brilliant woman . Surely you can appreciate , at the very least , the genius of the concept . Picture it . If you could streamline your spouse , if you could overhaul every annoying habit , every physical flaw , every moment , the whining and nagging , the farting in bed . Imagine if you could enjoy the person you love , but only at their very best . And the only reason for your anger , your resentment , your rage , is really very simple . You 're furious because we thought of it first . While you were trying to become men , we decided to become gods . Let me ask you something . These machines , these Stepford wives , can they say , " I love you " ? - Mike ? - Of course . In 58 languages . But do they mean it ? Enjoy . [ Gasping , heavy breathing ] [ Mike ] Walter . Walt ... Joanna , right here . - Sarah . - Claire . - Marianne . - Charmaine . - Roger . - Roberta . [ Indistinct chatter ] Mike ! [ Chanting ] Mike ! Mike ! Mike ! Mike ! Mike ! Mike ! Mike ! Mike ! Mike ! Good evening , everyone . What a delight to see all of our wonderful wives and their happy , happy husbands . Tonight is truly the highlight of our year , because tonight we honour our very newest citizens of Stepford . In my opinion , the cream of the crop , a couple that proudly proclaims Stepford the American way of love . [ All ] Aw ... Now ... I 'd like to ask my wonderful woman , my lovely wife , my bride , my best friend , to join me in a glorious midsummer night 's waltz . - Is everything perfect ? - Everything . Mike ... Darling . - My pleasure . - It 's an honour . - Champagne ? - Allow me . [ Alarm sounds ] [ Computer ] Doors activate . Welcome , Member 1-9-5-6 . Kresby , Walter . Entering secure area . Warning . Warning . Initiating . So , Joanna , are you enjoying Stepford ? Oh , yes . The town is so splendid . Everyone is so kind . And then , of course , there 's you . Me ? It 's simple really . Honey ! - Grab me another scotch . - Right away , dear . [ Computer ] Begin nano-reversal . Begin nano-reversal . Nano-reversal completed . Ah ! [ Computer ] Deleting Stepford program . Ah ! [ Power shutting down ] [ Computer ] File corrupted . Deleting vacuuming function . - Honey ? - Oh , Herbert . [ Computer ] Nano-reversal ... Original personality ... Deleting Stepford wives program . What is this ? What am I wearing ? [ Frantic chatter ] [ Sobbing ] Mike ! Mike ! There 's something unspeakable going on in the ballroom ! You have to come right now ! It 's an apocalypse ! What did you do to us ? [ All ] Mike ! Mike ! Men ! Control your wives ! Control your wives ! - [ Beeping ] - It 's not working ! This is not Stepford ! Mike ! What 's happening ? I was in the garden and I was dreaming of your smile and your aftershave . Then I realised ... I can do better . [ Sighs ] - Walt . - She 's not a robot . - [ Man ] What ? - [ Man # 2 ] She 's not a robot ? She never was . I couldn 't do it . - Why not ? - Because she 's not a science project . Because I didn 't marry something from RadioShack . - That 's a shame . - No . That 's a man . - I thought you were ready ! - [ Men ] Yeah . I thought you were ready ! I thought I knew you ! - You 're a disgrace ! - [ Men ] Yeah , you tell him ! To everything this town stands for . - To the future . - That 's right ! You 're gonna have to pay for that ! Don 't you touch him ! No ! He 's a Stepford husband ? [ Crying ] An angel . Now he 's just spare parts , thanks to you ! What are you ? Are you a person or a machine ? I 'm a lady . - A real lady ? - Every inch . Wait . A real , real lady ? Are you a human being ? Yes . And I may very well be the only decent human being left . - In Stepford ? - In the world ! She 's fabulous . All of this , Mike , the wives , Stepford . This was all your idea ? Yes . All I wanted was a better world . A world where men were men , and women were cherished and lovely . Does anyone have a screwdriver ? She 's nuts . A world of romance and beauty . Of tuxedos and chiffon . A perfect world . - But you were married to a robot . - The perfect man . And all I wanted was to make you , all of you into perfect women . But we don 't need to be perfect . How could you do this to us ? Because I was just like you . Over-stressed , over-booked , under-loved . I was the world 's foremost brain surgeon and genetic engineer . I had top secret contracts with the Pentagon , Apple and Mattel . I was driven , exhausted . Until late one night I came home to find ... Mike with Patricia . My brilliant , blonde , 21 - year-old research assistant . It was all so ugly . Then early the next morning , as I gazed across the breakfast table at their lifeless bodies , I thought , " What have I done ? " But more importantly , " what could I do to make the world more beautiful ? " I had the skills . But I needed help to realise my larger vision . And so I made Mike . Because he was someone other men would listen to . And then I asked myself , " Where would people never notice a town full of robots ? " Connecticut . So I decided to turn back the clock . To a time before overtime . Before quality time . Before women were turning themselves into robots . - Back off ! - Sorry . But why didn 't you change the men , too ? That 's next . You 're insane . I 'm in love with a waltz and a town . And a man . [ Explosive charge ] [ All gasping ] [ Larry King ] Joanna , you produced the documentary ... Stepford : The Secret of the Suburbs . And won ... five Emmys , was it ? Six . - She 's shy . - And so humble . And , Bobbie , your ordeal has led to a bestseller . I just can 't hold a grudge , so I 've written my first book of poetry . It 's all about hope and communication and the healing power of love . What is it called ? Wait Until He 's Asleep , Then Cut It Off . - It 's a page-turner . - I cried . Now , Roger , good news . You ran and won . You 're in the State Senate . - Independent . - Next stop , the White House . - This country needs highlights . - Our hero . Jo , Walter really came through for you . So how 's your marriage now ? Is everything just ... perfect ? No way . But we 're doing just great . Because now we know for sure it 's not about perfection . " Perfect . " Perfect doesn 't work . [ Larry ] What about the other husbands ? Are they angry ? Do they still want all these women to be robots ? Of course . Men are pigs . They 're disgusting . They 're frightened , little rodents . - We 're trying to help . - Right . [ Clears throat ] We 're trying to re-educate them . - And where are they ? - Oh , they 're still in Stepford . Under house-arrest . Hey , you guys . Which aisle is quilted paper towels ? If I don 't get the right kind , my wife 'll kill me . Aisle three . [ Woman on speaker ] No talking ! Keep shopping !

 Previously on Farscape ... Katratzi ... It 's the name of a place . The place where they took Aeryn . I gave you a chance . Where is Crichton ? Katratzee . That 's the name of the base . Where is it ? Disguises its presence by mirroring the orbit of one of the moons of Trelax . I know that planet . The female is pregnant . Her fetus must be saved . Is there a suitable recipient for transplant ? - What about Scorpius ? - What about him ? - Well , he might have been captured . - Or killed . Harvey ... you 're not dead ! I am the ... ' undead ' . That 's not funny . Scorpius knows everything you know . Memories , thoughts , dreams ... wormhole technology . No . No ! You must ... go back for him . And now on Farscape ... Where does it hurt , Scorpius ? Here ? Or here ? Tell me what you know about wormholes , hmm ? Even the smallest secret and I 'll leave you in peace for an arn . I 've been searching my whole life for a female like you . This is madness . Could be genius , Sparky . You know , there 's a very fine line between the two . Geniuses make plans . We 're going to walk into the most heavily guarded base in the Scarran empire , start a civil war and walk out with Scorpius . What part of that do you not understand ? How you two can possibly believe it 'll work . We 've been spotted . - What did you just say ? - Don 't you ever listen to the plans ? I told them that we were escorting John Crichton and he wants to join the negotiations . Oh , great ! Now they 're guaranteed to blow us to hezmana . Keep it down ! They 've just given us clearance to dock . That 's it ... I need it now . It 's not too late to change our minds . That 's true , but we just passed the Jenek freighter which means that Scorpius is probably nearby . That 's it ? That 's it . Mankind 's greatest contribution to the absurd . The thermonuclear bomb . Subtitles : PK SUB-66 We 're so screwed - Part 2 : Hot to Katratzi Emperor Staleek ... despite what your Minister of War might believe , this offer of peace is genuine . Every day you fail to take it seriously ... we build more and more wormhole weapons . Soon the urge to use one will become irresistible . Not to interrupt your bluster ... but we have a guest who should make these talks even more amusing . - John Crichton . - And partners . What did we miss ? You 've taken a great risk coming here . Why shouldn 't I just have you seized , right now ? Well , maybe this . What 's that ? Plutonium core . Tritium shell . Does that translate ? A fission bomb . Put those down ! Nice threads . You must be the Emperor . Now , before anybody decides to get clever , you should know I have multiple deadman sensors from every culture on my ship and a few cultures I haven 't heard of . My heart stops ... we all go boom . My heart speeds up , it 's boom again . Too hot , too cold , too happy , too sad , thirsty , hungry , bored ... it 's John Lee Hooker time . Boom , boom , boom . And you try your little psychic trick kaboom . And we 're all pushing up day-glo daisies . Why do I doubt that ? Because you lack imagination . What do you want ? What do I want ? What do I want ? I ... have not been chasing my ass all over the galaxie trying to pull out chunks of my brain . I ... have not been sneaking fembots ... and skreeths into the places where I live . You want something ! You . You want ... what 's inside my head . You want ... what I know about wormholes . Because I can leap tall galaxies in a single bound . I can scorch planets with a wave of my hand ... and you ... and you ... and you ... You can 't do jack . That 's ... not ... true . Oh , really ? You command the stars to do your bidding ? I know you can 't . And you can 't . And you can 't . And you won 't . But I have . Then why are you here ? Because I ... am an American . And what does an American want ? Democracy ? Capitalism ! I want to sell out and settle down . For one day only , it 's a blue lightspecial on aisle three . My wormhole technology ... and ... a free set of steak knives for all the tea in China and anything you can imagine to pay me . - Pay ? - Yes ! Pay cash . He 's crazy . Isn 't it fun ? Welcome ... to my cold war . Now ... what am I offered for all the powers of the Universe ? I think Crichton 's bluffing . The bomb isn 't real and he has nothing to give us . He 's come for Scorpius . We know they 're working together . At the border station the two of them ... Get me a full analysis of Crichton 's weapon and how to disarm it . Why would Crichton risk so much just to rescue an ally ? He may be in league with Commandant Grayza ... to prevent Scorpius from giving us wormhole technology . Ridiculous ! It was Crichton 's females who rescued Grayza . From your clumsy attempt to abduct her . Another one of your failures ... Minister Ahkna . Lovely of them to invite us in . They did not have much choice , did they ? Well , I think we 've located all of the surveillance devices . Pilot 's enhanced the encryption so comms should be secure . Anyone have any problems , phone home . Fat man and I will throw our weight around . You all know the plan ? Uh ... no . Refresh me . - Wrinkles ? - Yes ? Charrids . Kalish . Recon . Peacekeepers ! A peace conference with the Emperor ... Very brave of you to enter Scarran space . Could say the same for you . John Crichton ... do not destroy the Sebacean people . You don 't need me for that . You 're doing a great job on your own . Everything that I have done has been calculated to gain peace . So you betrayed the Luxans ? Maybe you should check your math . Give us wormhole weapons and everyone will be safe . Didn 't she say she already had that ? We are very , very close . You know that we have sent Prowlers into wormholes . If I can buy peace even for an arn or two ... perhaps we can develop them . And what will you do ? Kill billions of your rivals ? Maybe kill us . Then name your price , Crichton . Anything that you can imagine . Ah ... there 's the rub . You see ... I can 't figure a way out of this situation but ... the first side that does wins . I 'm to allow them onto their ship ? If they wish . Crichton and his crew have negotiated full access to all common areas and we will acquiesce for the time being . Let me ask you somethin . You short-faced Scarrans ... you all look alike , you know ? But , uh , were you ... were you , uh , down , down on the border station ? Yes . Then you were the one that , uh ... that ordered Aeryn and me to be cut open . Yeah ... I got another one for yah . Do Scarrans have mivonks ? Yes ... but they 're not external . ... because the Kalish had no idea 'cause he 's a frelling hapooda ! Uh ... don 't you Charrids ever bathe ? Listen , uh ... the Scarrans have nothing decent to drink and I won 't drink with the Kalish . Got any Raslak ? Sit down . Thank you . Secretary Vakali ? What are you doing here ? This is a restricted area . I have urgent information . I believe the Charrids are trying to expel the Kalish from Katratzi by force . And who are you to possess such erroneous intelligence ? Just like you , I am a devoted Kalish . Without us to administer their empire , the Scarran system of government will collapse . What if they fear you will take it away from them ? Please ... please , Secretary . We need to talk . Sir ... you 're too prominent to be seen with her . I will speak to her . That is ... terrible . Even the Scarrans should treat you better . What do you want , Luxan ? Me ? I 've got what I want . Oh ? You enjoy traveling with a group of thieves and a Hynerian slug ? You would too , if you were being paid what I 'm being paid . Which is what ? I think you 'd better take that up with my employer . What 's this ? Dinner ? This is opportunity . You will submit identification details before we can process a background analysis . I will not submit for background appraisal . You will trust me as I am , or I am gone . Now ... what of your back ... ground ? How many other bioloids are here ? I am the one resistance member to infiltrate this posting . How much hatred exists here between the Charrids and the Kalish ? Even more than the outer worlds . There 's more at stake . Bigger egos . Then I will be straight ... with you . We want to ignite that hatred and we want to use it as a cover for our escape . Will you help us ? 1812 ... get that Scarran vacuum cleaner outta here . That 's a good boy ! Do you think she 's figured it out yet ? I don 't think so . She still looks pretty damned stressed . I 'm not surprised . If she doesn 't go home with a peace treaty ... she 's going to be in a lot of trouble with High Command . I reckon . As long as your stress levels are all right . Ah , well ... considering the fact that we 're now nuclear terrorists ... bomb seems to think I 'm okay . Provided that thing 's working . It 's working . Oh ... you are dangerous ! Well , you better keep away that . Sire ... We have a good scan of Crichton 's fission device but decoding it could take some time . Not if you expect to prosper . You came back . Couldn 't figure a way to disarm my bomb , huh ? Not yet . Refreshment ? Crystherium Utilia . An acquired taste . Streletzia ... hummingbird feeder . You know of our delicacy ? Bird of Paradise ? Yah , Mom 's garden . Dime a dozen . Did you come all this way to discuss botany ? Or to make an offer ? Have you got anything to offer or is all this just an elaborate bluff ? You don 't believe ... that I can control wormholes ? Would you believe without proof ? Fine . We 'll meet you halfway . Navigational data chip . Local star chart . Send a ship to the designated coordinates and let us know when they arrive . Why ? Proof . Command performance . We 're gonna put on the wormhole show , just ... for you . Not interested , huh ? I 'm sure Grayza will be . Wait ... Dispatch a stryker with full instrumentation to these coordinates . Have you checked Crichton 's ship ? No . It 's protected by a force-field . We may be able to override it . Do so . Check its logs , its star charts . Get all the information you can . This is folly . Crichton plainly knows nothing about wormholes . And Scorpius does ? We 'll soon find out . He 's ready for his final inquisitor . You 're very resiliant , Scorpius . It must be my Scarran genes . We could trade places and find out . How would you like to punish me ? If you want the pleasure of knowing , release me for an arn . Oh , I wish we had more time . But what I need to know now is what you do know about wormholes . Well , torture me and I will amuse myself with dreams of you . Kill me ... and my knowledge dies with me . Are you sure ? Even if an old friend helped you to the other side ? Stark ? ! There 's no way to escape , Scorpius . Not even into death . Because ... as you 're making your agonizing passage ... to the other side . I am going to capture your soul and with it ... everything you know . I 've waited many cycles for this , Scorpius ! Dreamed so many sleepless dreams . Every dashed hope , every plunge into terrified despair that I suffered at your hands in the Aurora Chair . But rather than the two cycles that fate gave you to screw with my soul , she 's only given me two arns to be finished with you . So , I guess I better be a little more ... imaginative . I think this may have possibilities . - Listen to this . - What ? Listen . Can you hear that ? That 's Scorpius . - You sure ? - Yes , yes . I 'm sure . Completely . You go tell Crichton . I 'll try and find out where they 're keepin him , okay ? Scorpius can 't possibly hold out much longer . If he hasn 't broken already . Rygel ? Oh , the Scarrans will never make you rich . I can make you rich if you come and work for me . - Rygel ? - Rygel is busy at the moment , John . Sikozu ? Everything is going to plan . The plan is too slow . Speed things up , please . Yah , well we 're going as fast as we can . I will try , but I 'll need some time , John . Why do we never have enough time ? Why should I go to work for a frelling Hynerian ... when I 'm already a general in the Scarran 's service ? Hah ! That 'll end very soon ... when the Scarrans sever all ties with the Charrids . You 're a lying slug ! They 're going to war with the Peacekeepers ! But not with you as their allies . Just with the Kalish . The Kalish are just techs . Well , the Scarrans are building a wormhole weapon . They need techs , not soldiers . And the Kalish know it . That 's why they 're planning to sabotage the Charrids by embarrassing you in front of the Scarrans . They would never be so bold as to do that ! Hah ! They are as stupid as the Kalish say they are . Join me before the Scarrans throw you off this rock . Crichton 's fission device ... it 's all just spare parts mostly , salvaged from devices I 've never seen before . I don 't care if it 's made out of your mother 's bones ... I need to know how to disarm it . - We just need a few solar days . - You don 't have them ! Either you 'll disarm it now or I 'll find some species that will . What do you think ? It 's just like she said . The Charrids are trying to incite the Scarrans against us and it 's starting to work . And what about Scorpius ? He 's somewhere on this level . Alright , well , if we can 't make it to Lo 'Lah , we 're going to be looking for alternate escape routes . To the surface ? - I 'll keep lookin . - Thank you . You have cost me a Stryker and its crew . Really ? How did I do that ? At your coordinates , a wormhole opened and swallowed them up ! What did you do ? Oh , no ... Do not tell me you ordered them into the wormhole ! She told you to call us when they got there ! You should 've warned me ! Don 't lay this off on me ! You wanted proof ... you got it . - Did you cause that wormhole to open ? - No ... no more freebies . You wantta do a deal , or you want me to sell it to the Peacekeepers so they can gobble up all of your warships ? - Do not threaten me ! - I 'm not threatening . I 'm just a guy with something to sell . You don 't want to buy it , I 'm sure someone else will . I didn 't push him too hard , did I ? He 'll make an offer . An entire cavern just to grow the flowers they eat ? And it 's a high security area . Why ? We don 't know . But only the Charrids are supposed to have the access codes . So , if anyone else enters the cavern , the Scarrans will assume the Charrids left it accessible like this . You stole the codes . Which is what the Charrids will suspect ... and they will confront us . Crichton ? We 've found a much faster way to incite a riot . That 's great . Let me hear it later . Nice pants . Hey , Braca ! You look a little lost . Does Mommy know you 're here ? Does Mommy know he 's Scorpius ' boy ? Oh , no . Mommy doesn 't know . Are you here to rescue him or kill him ? Stark ! Conceal yourself . - We 're here to see Scorpius . - Come in . Just you . John ... Grasshopper ... That 's a nice hat . Ahkna , don 't ! What do you say ? Too happy , too sad , too cold , too hot ? Let 's see ? I know you have a real nuclear device , but I 'm sure you can disarm it . I would ... but I can 't so ... I won 't . You 're bluffing . Well , so much for nuclear deterrence ... get ready to kiss your ass good-bye , Castro . You 're insane ! Release her . You all right ? - Yah ! - You 're mad . Just played a game of chicken . Did I win ? Just ... this time . You take the initiative next time . I 'll take it now . Frell it . Not yet . Aeryn ... You found Scorpius being tortured and you just left him there ? It 's not time yet . That 's why we 're here . Morning . As long as this helps start the conflict . Yes , it will . Might even get yourselves killed . Then we 'll all go together . Give me your hand ... and put it on my shoulder . Come here . All right , now stand on my feet . Comfortable ? You ? Hold tight . I don 't care what you think the Kalish might or might not do . The Scarrans would never dissolve our partnership . What partnership ? You aren 't their partners . You 're nothing more than ill-paid , ill-treated and ill-smelling servants . I don 't think so . Is this our floor ? I don 't know . Have to get out and have a look around . Intruder alert in the Crystherium chamber . Quick , check it ! Now ! Hurry ! Never knew Scarrans were so sentimental . No one around . So ... what do you want to do to get noticed ? I got arrested once . College . Let me show ya . What are you doing here ? Come out ... now ! Damn ! Up . Now ! There 's never enough time . Who gave you the codes ? What codes ? Codes ? We didn 't need no stinking codes . You could not have accessed the cavern without the codes . We didn 't try to access anything . Some Charrids got off the elevator . We got on , we got off ... well , we tried to get off . We got interrupted . Which Charrids ? Are you serious ? They all look alike . You should put numbers on their uniforms . The Charrid troops are your responsibility . I 'll order a full inquiry . You know , while you 're at it ... give me Scorpius . You want Scorpius ? Why ? Is it because he 's going to give us what you 're trying to sell us ? No . Because the hat lady is pissing me off and I wantta piss her off . Tit for tat . Call it a whim . And I don 't like watching people be tortured who don 't know anything . What do you know about wormholes , Scorpius ? Tell me ! I know nothing ! You 're lying ! You tell me ! I said I know nothing ... know nothing ! It 's ... a normal part of the procedure . He ... he 's strong . Very strong ... That means , when he finally breaks , it 'll be all the more catastrophic . You promised me ... That I would break him , not that he knows anything , but if he does , you will know . - What is happening in here ? ! - You wanted the information taken from him . Alive . I said alive . - And have you learned anything ? - No , not yet , but I ... Crichton has destroyed a stryker and found a way into the caverns ... but you have achieved nothing . Get out ! - This is my jurisdiction . - Not unless I say it is . Now , get out . All of you ! I 'll get the truth from him . I thought you said she couldn 't harm you . And she couldn 't ! I 'm fine . Quite fine . I 've caused enough harm in my time to mimic it well . We still haven 't found a way of disarming Crichton 's weapon ... but he has demonstrated a convincing command of wormholes . I can separate him from the bomb . He trusts me ... more than he realizes . Just bring him to me ! Will you ? Or will you betray me ? I 've served you for ten cycles as a spy . Why would I betray you now ? Betray me , and you will die in this machine ... but deliver Crichton 's knowledge to me ... and all the power you seek will be yours . Thank you for returning . What is it ? I would like to make an addition to my offer . I 'll have the kung pao chicken . You want a spring roll ? Actually , they 're a pardon from the Supreme Council . No Peacekeeper would dare violate them . Is she for real ? It would seem so . - However , it is conditional . - Of course ! On no wormhole technology being shared with the Scarrans . What if we give these back ? Still valid . She wouldn 't dare destroy them . I 've witnessed them . So have all our principal officers . Keep it . We 'll let you know . Guys ... listen up . They 're bringing him now . One riot , well done . Hold the mayo ... now ! Your troops compromised the security of the cavern . No ! That is not what happened . We are very close to a conflict now . This ain 't horseshoes or hand grenades ... " now " means now ! A bargain is struck however an agreement requires trust , which , thus far , has been one-sided . Now , you tell me what else you really want . When you wake up ... in the morning ... on your big Emperor bed ... and you listen ... what do you hear ? Do you hear the little Emperor birdies singing outside your window ? Do you hear the Emperor wind whistling through the trees ? Or do you hear people dying ? Do you hear your friends begging for mercy ? Do you hear doors being kicked in because people are hunting you ? Do you hear the sound of your heart pounding in your ears ? What I want ... Santa Claus ! For the rest of my life ... I wanna wake up like an Emperor . Your safety , guaranteed . In just a few arns . Bill Gates can 't guarantee Windows . How you gonna guarantee my safety ? With great effort ... and great sincerity . Though at some point , my largesse will dissipate . My appreciation . My ... ass ! Did you tell them ? No . Wormholes ... my brain ... Harvey ! What did you tell them ? Nothing ! Listen up ... I am Johnny Radiation because of you , Nosferatu . Everyone I care about west of the Moon is here ... and in danger to make sure that you keep your mouth shut . Now ! Did you keep your mouth shut ? Yes ! John ... You believe him ? Yes , I do . Good . Kill him and let 's go . What ? - Kill him and let 's go . - We came here to free him . No . We came here to make sure that my knowledge didn 't slip out of his mouth . - Kill him , Aeryn and let 's go . - Oh , you want me to kill him ? Well , I 'm not the assassin , am I ? If you want him to die , you can kill him yourself . You made me promise that I wouldn 't . - Well , I release you from that promise . - Say that again . I release you from that promise . Thank you . I 'll give you my bike if you kill him . May I speak ? - No ! - No ... He 's telling the truth . We 'll sort you out later . Guys ! I apologize in advance for any incivility or insensitivity on my part , but it is beer o 'clock ... where the hell is my riot ? The logs show your Lieutenant had just returned from the cavern . Whose logs ? His ? Kalish documentation ! What are you implying , Rahzaro ? Ohhh , you 're going to get it ! That our intruder could not decipher the access codes to the cavern by himself . Someone had to have given them to him . I protest this baseless accusation . Then ... find out where the fault does lie . I expect a full account from each side in less than two arns . Tear down the system to the foundation . Find the leak . I will not be humiliated by you , Vakali . You will not destroy my relationship with the Emperor . What the frell are you blathering about , Charrid ? Your security forces prove useless and you seek to refocus the blame ! Useless ? My forces , useless ? ! Ordering biscuits and repairing urinals has never won a war . And neither have you , if I recall . Insult a Charrid at your own risk ... Kalish hapooda . Hapooda ? You dare to call me ' hapooda ' ? And I bet ... not a very good one . What is this ? Stop it . Stop it at once ! Strike warriors to the control center . Confiscate all weapons . Now , Crichton . Leave now . And never doubt your Dominar again . I must go . Go ! We 've been sabotaged . The Charrids and Kalish are fighting . Guards ! Secure Crichton and report . Scorpius ... we must secure Scorpius . Don 't worry about Scorpius . He 's not going anywhere . Everyone , go . We 're on the move . Some help would be appreciated . Where do you expect us to run ? Got a taxi waiting . First rule of piss-poor planning ... have your exit ready before your entrance . - What ? This disturbance ? - Yah , pretty cool , huh ? - Yes , I 'm impressed . - There 's just no pleasing some people . Remain where you are , or I 'll shoot . Release your weapons , now . - Braca ? - Yah , feel the love , Mr Burns . Frell ! Hey , can you help us ? We 're ... we 're afraid . You have to turn back . Can 't pass here . It works ! We 're getting close . Don 't leave without us . Warrior ... can you take this Kalish piece of tralk ? - Nice . - Hurry up ! We try it a third time ? - Warrior ... - What ? Could you take this Kalish piece of tralk ? We 're almost home . There it is . D 'Argo 's vessel , even shrouded cannot outrun a stryker ! Moya 's disguised as an oil freighter in the shipping yards . She 's rested and ready to starburst . Oh , crap ! Aeryn ... We can broker a bargain . Where 's yer nerve , Grasshopper ? Just stick with me . They ain 't gonna pop fat man . I can 't ! You better not pass out . Get up ... or I kill you now . Choose . You need to know when a woman 's serious . Are you coming ? Okay . Drop your weapons ! Don 't fire or you 'll detonate the bomb . Well , there you go . Someone finally got smart . You stupid son-of-a-bitch ! I 'm sorry , John . You need to breathe deeply if you expect to live . You 're gonna get us all killed ! Now ... if you trust me enough to live you may well discover the truth . Trust you ? Subtitles : PK SUB-66

 Previously on Jake 2.0 : I 'm Jake Foley , tech support . I see you 're still at the NSA . We got a problem . You see how the nanites have positioned themselves along his central nervous system . This guy can interface with technology . He 's like a universal remote , and every one of his body functions is enhanced . I 've just been authorized to create a special ops team with you at its core . - Jake . - Sarah . What are you doing here ? Oh , I 'm just researching some case law . Privacy issues , e-mails , NSA stuff . Well you 're not going to get anywhere today . It-it 's Sunday . The library 's closing . Oh , man . I just ran all the way across town . What are you doing here ? Ugh , soybeans . The farm bill . I thought I told you this . Oh , right , right , right . Well , uh , I 'm free . You wanna , you want to go get some coffee ? Sure , yeah . Great . Okay . Oh , my god , that was horrible . I 've never seen a human being that shade of green . All right , look . In my defense , it was the first time I 'd ever tried tequila . You picked a hell of a place to do it . Lincoln fought a war to preserve the union , and you thanked him by puking on his shoes . Yeah , he never looked at me the same after that . Oh , we were better with beer . Mmm . Grown up a little bit since then , huh ? You did . You definitely have . You think ? Yeah , you seem more confident . Especially lately . I don 't know , I can 't really put my finger on it , but you 're just different . Well , I 've been working out a little bit . Can 't tell . Oh , man . Oh , come on , you set me up for that one . So you can tell . Um ... not really . I 'm just kidding . What 's happening ? Base , come in . Base , we are under attack . Base , come in . - They 're jamming the signal . - What do we do ? Nothing . The glass is completely bulletproof . The body is a zinc-alloy steel . They 're not getting in here . Come on . We got to get out of here . Do not open that door . We can 't do resist it . - I 'm getting out . - No ! Give it to me . That 's me . Jake Foley , I 'm in Tech Support . Security Clearance : Low . Very low . Then one day , it all changed . Now , I can do things I 've never dreamed of . I 've been upgraded . I have these powers . Life just got real interesting . Okay , go left on the next street . Come on . Yeah , yeah . Here we go . Okay , Jake , you 're pushing too hard , all right ? No , no , no . I 'm about to make the Eiffel Tower . No , no , no . I think that we need to take a break . No , no , no , no . I 'm almost to the Eiffel Tower . Jake , the purpose of this exercise is not winning the game , okay ? Yeah , right . Come on . No , okay , I 'm going to turn it off . No , no , no , no . Hold on , hold on . There it is ! Almost there . Come on . There it is , there it is . Yeah , Oh yeah , I won it ! Hhmm ... I beat the game . Oh , yeah , you broke the machine . Um , see , the purpose of the whole exercise is not to win the game , it 's to learn how to control the nanites , and , you know , just for your info - not controlling the nanites . - I 'll buy the NSA a new one . - Oh , well ... somebody 's in a good mood today . Yeah , I had a good weekend . - Yeah , really ? - I had a date . Sort of . Uh , I don 't know - it kind of seemed like a date , I think . A sort of , kind of date . That , uh , sounds intriguing . - Yeah . - Uh , who 's the girl ? Sarah . We went to Georgetown together . She never really gave me the time of day , but yesterday at lunch ... I don 't know . It kind of seemed like things might be changing , you know ? That 's good . My advice to you - don 't push too hard . It was a perfectly orchestrated attack . What were they after ? John Ramsey , senior engineer for GDLS . He was transporting preliminary schematics for a next generation composite tank . Plastic and glass fiber . It 's as strong as what we 've got , but 70 percent lighter . They can be flown in just about anywhere . So who are we looking for ? There 's been increased chatter on echelon indicating possible Chinese involvement . How long since you 've had contact with Mei Ling ? Two and a half years . I can 't help you . Kyle , she is our most senior double agent in Chinese intelligence . If there 's anyone who could confirm their involvement , let alone help us get this thing back , it would be her . There must be someone else who 's been handling her . No one she 's been nearly as forthcoming with . The schematics are on an encrypted laptop . They have to be physically removed from the country in order for their techs to decode it . It could be smuggled by diplomatic pouch at any moment , Kyle . Are you ordering me to do this ? Once you 've determined the meeting place , we 'll get a team in there and monitor ... No . No . You want me to talk to her , I talk to her alone . No , Kyle , it 's protocol . It 's for your safety as well as hers . This woman reads a room better than anyone I know . She can sniff out any agent . Not necessarily . They call this art ? You must be in trouble . And why do you say that ? You called . I 'm sure you know the Chinese have stolen something very important to us . We want it back . A statement was issued . We 've formally denied ... That means nothing . It 's all I know . So , tell me ... when did you become such a patriot ? Two and a half years ago . I 'll give you the exact date if you don 't remember . I remember . I 'm prepared to offer you full asylum . Five years expenses . Why should I trust you ? Because this is work , Mei Ling . I 've never failed you there . Full asylum , and two million dollars . That 's a lot of money . You have a lot to make up for . I need to get authorization . I 'd suggest you work quickly . The schematics are being held in the archives within the secure corridor at the embassy . It 's scheduled to be taken out tonight by diplomatic pouch . How do we get it ? There 's a reception beginning at 8 : 00 pm . You 'll be my guest . You haven 't changed . Neither have you . So , you and Mei Ling kind of have this casablanca thing going on . Which is none of my business . It 's just ... I can sort of relate . See , I 'm having this situation with someone from my past ... right , you don 't care . So I guess you 're going to that party tonight . Absolutely not . Lou , those were her terms . Kyle , you 're no longer a field agent . Your cover was blown . Anything you do out there 's a risk . Well , you had no problem sending me out there this morning . D.C. is not the field . That embassy is sovereign territory . You get caught inside , you 're on your own . There 's nothing we can do . Once those schematics leave the country ... then there 's nothing we can do . We have other agents who can perform this operation , ones who wouldn 't be as valuable to the Chinese if they got caught . I don 't think that 's possible . Uh ... I heard everything that they said , and she only wants Kyle . To-to do this . Do you trust her ? I trust her enough . Well , this is all kind of sudden , don 't you think ? I mean , the nanites are really sensitive , and it 's not like you mastered control , you know , that 's fine in the video game , but this , this is the Chinese embassy , okay ? They have guns and guards and , and foreign languages . I mean , anything could go wrong . Jake , have you really thought about this ? Diane , this is my first mission . I 'm nervous enough , you 're really not helping . Yeah , sorry . Mei Ling Wong has arranged an invitation for me under the name Felix Garay , Venezuelan Oil Executive . At 10 : 00 pm in the main ballroom , she 'll give me a security card . It 'll allow me access to the main secure corridor . Now , at this point , we have to get Mei Ling out . If they trace that card to her , she 's dead . How do we get her out ? Catering truck . Agent De Grasso will be the driver . The secure corridor is located in the basement of the embassy . Once I 'm down there , I 'll be out of range for thermal imaging . Getting there from the main ballroom , I 'll encounter security cameras here , here ... and here . Security guards change shifts at 10 : 30 . That 's where Jake comes in . Diane ? Diane ? Yes . Jake , Jake will interface with the security recording devices , and , uh , rewind them thirty minutes , temporarily disabling them in the process , so when Kyle 's on the move , the hallways will appear empty . The main security office is located here , just off the main ballroom . How close does he have to be ? Uh , well , based on our tests , I 'd say no more than , uh , 30 ... - 30 feet . - Great , great . So what 's my cover ? Uh , I speak a little Spanish , so maybe I can be another oil executive . Wait . But ... oh no , ' cause we , we can 't be together uh ... royalty ? Too obvious ? Okay ... billionaire software mogul ... Jake ... we create the cover . Oh , right . Right , sorry , of course . So , uh , what do you have in mind ? Hors d 'oeuvres ? They don 't serve themselves . We 've added markers to our agent 's heat signatures . This way our satellites can distinguish them from the other guests at the party . That 's Kyle and Jake in the ballroom , and De Grasso by the van . Oh , no ... I got data streaming in from his nanites . What the problem ? He 's really nervous . Thank you . Oh , uh ... thank you . Don 't mention it . Stop and go . Stop and ... go ... Thank you . Jake ! Sarah . Hey ... Okay , this freaking me out . I keep running into you everywhere . Yeah , that 's ... that 's crazy . Must be fate . So what are you doing here ? Um ... you know , just another invite . Heard they had good food . Oh , the wild mushroom tart is fabulous , you have to try one . Oh , you know , I 've had a whole tray . Jake . You look great . Ah , it 's a rental . Well , you certainly fill it out well . I told , I told you I was working out . Look , uh , look ... I don 't know who , who he 's talking to , but , his , his blood pressure is rising and his heart rate is increasing . His adrenals are activated . Lou ... Lou , is there any way maybe that we can pull him out of this , because , I , I don 't know , I , I think this is not good . Diane . The mission hasn 't even started yet . Okay , yeah . Are you nervous ? What ? Ah , no . No , no , no , I 'm having a great time , this is , you know I missed this last year , and it 's , this is good . You think ? You 're not having fun ? Fun ? You know why I 'm here , Jake ? Congressman Williams . The Agriculture Committee ? My fun involves lingering around the background , waiting for the right moment to make small talk , in the hopes he comes aboard for the Farm Bill . Truth be told , I 'd rather be anywhere else . - Really ? - Yeah . I 'm sorry ... talking your ear off . One glass of veuve clicquot too many . - Uh ... - What are you doing ? Uh , nothing . Nothing , it 's just so crowded over there . Hot , you know , uh , you , you wanna go dance ? Let 's dance . How have you been ? Well , I haven 't danced in a while . I couldn 't tell . Now you 're just flattering me . Is it that obvious ? About as subtle as that dress you 're wearing . Does it look familiar ? Hong Kong . Impressive . And I wasn 't even wearing it for very long . Look at those two . I mean , get a room . Maybe they 're just caught up in the moment . Yeah ... that happens . Right now , if you had to choose , me or the mission ... At the bar , directly behind me , is a waiter . He 's an agent . He 'll escort you to the catering truck and get you out of here . Mei Ling , you have to go . Now . Oh , incoming . There 's your mark . Oh , whoa ! Why 'd you do that ? Do you know what ? It 's , it 's nothing that can 't wait . Just for ... just for right now , I want to forget about work and have some fun . Okay . What 'd you have in mind ? I want to feel like we did in college . You know , I want to ... get a six pack and go to the Lincoln Memorial , and not worry about anything at all . What do you think ? Uh ... I think that sounds ... perfect . Okay . Come on , let 's do it . Uh ... I , I can 't . Why ? Excuse me . I need a refill . You 're , you 're a waiter . Yes , he is . And let 's make it a double this time . Can I get a rye on the rocks ? Make it a double . - Was that really necessary ? - Yes , it was . Jake , you can 't afford to get distracted . Well , I wasn 't the only one who was being distracted . You still have feelings for her ? - That 's irrelevant . - Is it ? You know what - it 's time . Let 's just finish this . Jake 's in place . Kyle 's on his way . Jake ... What are you doing ? I 'm , uh ... I 'm not exactly sure how to explain what I 'm doing . You 're moonlighting . You 're making a little extra money on the side . Jake , you don 't have to pretend with me . Sarah ... I 'm an undercover agent . I 'm here on a huge mission . That 's hilarious , Jake . Okay , when are you getting off ? Uh ... l-l-less than an hour . Right . Lincoln Memorial . - I 'll get the beer . - Okay . What are you doing ? I 'm quitting . He 's in . Telephone . Agent Wallace . Lou Beckett . What do you mean , she never made it to the safe house ? Where 's the driver ? Oh , no . Good job . Unfortunately , you made the wrong choice . It will help you be more honest . I know how difficult that could be for you . You could 've gotten out . You could 've been free from this life . I am out . Delivering you is my final mission . Don 't do this , Mei Ling . It didn 't have to be like this . Two and a half years ago , we could 've made a life together . Two and a half years ago ... you would 've been dead . We have a situation at the Chinese embassy . Yes . I understand . Jake is still on the grounds . What 's happening ? Mei Ling never made it to the safe house . I can 't reach Agent De Grasso . Kyle was supposed to check in ten minutes ago . His intel on our mainland agents is far more valuable to the Chinese than the schematics . Well , but he 's an experienced agent . I mean , he would never ... say anything . When they 're through with him , he won 't have a choice . Ms. Beckett . Agent De Grasso 's dead . Jake , you listen to me . You need to get out of there now . I can 't . There 's guards everywhere . Your cover hasn 't been compromised . Just act casual . Walk through the front gate . We 'll have a team waiting there for you . Where 's Kyle ? We haven 't heard from him yet . What ? I can 't just leave him here . Jake , Kyle 's an experienced agent . If he has any problems , he can handle it . Okay . Okay . Now , you just stay on the phone . You 're just talking to a friend . I don 't believe you . We intercepted a message . Chinese intelligence suspected you were working with us . They had snipers waiting outside the Hotel in Seville . If I had shown up there ... if I 'd even shown up in the city ... they would 've killed you . I did what I did ... to save your life . You 're lying . Mei Ling , listen to me . Why do you think I 'm here ? Why do you think I 'm doing this ? To get you out once and for all ... so that we can be together . I love you . It 's too late . You 're almost there . Yes ... she didn 't want the glass . She wanted the whole bottle . Yeah . Wait a minute . We 're not getting anything out of him . - I hear him . - What ? I hear him . It 's Kyle . He ... he 's in the basement . - It was a setup . - What ? They wanted Kyle all along . This whole thing was a setup . Jake , you need to get out of there right now . Uh ... hello ? Where are you going ? Jake , you-you-you 're not heading towards the gate . I 'm , uh , I 'm losing you . Jake . All you have to do ... is give me names . I see . Oh , my god . He 's gone . Look at this , he 's gone . Seventy-five thousand volts of electricity . Are you sure ? You go ahead . Enough ? You go to hell . No worries , I 've all night Hey ! Come on . What are you doing ? I 'm getting you out of here . No ... Jake . Jake . There 's no way out . Sure there is . I want you to stab me in the throat . As hard as you can . - What ? - Jake , listen to me . They make me talk , people will die . This is what being an agent is all about . Now , do your job . My job ... is to get you out of here . Now , come on . Jake , there 's no way out . I can 't see anything . You 've got to trust me . Look . Look ! They 're alive . How are we doing this ? Those new Cadillacs , they 're completely computerized , right ? Yeah . Yeah . Go . Go , now . Come with me . I can 't . You must go now . Go . Are you going to open the gates ? Nope . Thank you . Thank you . They 're out . That fear thing ... it never goes away . Bali . On the beach . She was wearing a white dress ... no shoes . Georgetown . Freshman year . I have no idea what she was wearing . I just remember her eyes . D.C. She held a gun to my head ... then she kissed me . I never kissed her .

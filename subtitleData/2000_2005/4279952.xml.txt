 All right , listen up , everyone . We 're at DEFCON 1 . It 's a comet . It 's not a flyby anymore . A comet cannot change course . This one has . Then it 's not a comet . We 're not sure what 's happened . There appears to be something out there . The light is gone , and-and thousands of people have just suddenly appeared . Finding Shawn and figuring out what happened to our son - that is my job . Diana Skouris , Tom Baldwin . You two will be one of the teams that 's responsible for investigating what happened to the returnees . And what about my parents ? They 're dead , aren 't they ? This is Maia Rutledge . She 's eight years old , only she was born in 1938 . No time has ssed . Returnee 2117 : Shawn Frell . Uncle mmy . Hi . He 's all yours . Hey , what about Kyle ? Kyle 's in a coma , Shawn . We 're letting them go . We 're letting them go ? We don 't have a legal right to hold them . Hey , Mom , Dad ! Shawn ! Hey , buddy . Remember me ? Nikki ? I 'm Richard . Lily . Lily Bonham from St. Louis ? You knew my granother . Some of these people have no place to go , no families left . What the hell are you looking at ? I used to live here . Heidi ? Yeah ? Heidi , it 's Mommy . It 's , uh ... it 's okay , sweetie , I got it . Brian . Lily . But there 's no mistake . You 're definitely pregnant . It 's a temporary restraining order . You can 't stop me from seeing her . If Orson can do those things , who knows where all this is going . So far we 've got one case , and maybe that 's all we 'll ever have . You haven 't noticed anything unusual with Shawn ? 'Cause I just need to know - if you had , you 'd tell me . What looks good today , Carl ? I have a whitefish with your name on it , Mrs. Martino . Oh . When you were gone , in 18 month , I haven 't got a decent piece of fish . You ... You take care of me . You are such a sweetheart . Aw , it 's easy being nice to you . Tell me , how does it feel to be back ? It 's okay . It 's good . Carl . It 's like I never left . What do you think you 're doing out there ? I was helping a customer . Rosie can help a customer . Derek can help a customer . I told you to stock the display cases . BuI-I ... I 've known Mrs. Martino since I was a kid . And I 'm supposed to care ? Now get that flounder on ice . Grace ! So how 'd it go today ? It was slow , as usual . It 's the neighborhood . It 's not like it used to be . It 's not that bad . Ug It 's gotten a lot worse since you were away . I don 't see it . You don 't want see it . Okay . I admit it , it 's not like when we were kids . Yeah , no one cares about the place anymore . There 's no pride . There 's no sense of community . I didn 't know you were so unhappy . I 'm not unhappy . Hey , I got you back , didn 't I ? I gonothing to complain about . Yeah . Oh ... Oh , I 'm sorry . Fish smell . I don 't mind . I 'll hop in the shower as soon as we get back . Hey , let 's cut across the park . The park ? Nobody goes into Bradley Park anymore . No . Yeah ? Sure they do . No . How do you think I got here ? It 's not safe . There 's nothing but lowlifes and junkies in there . Grace , 15 years ago , I proposed to you in this park . Aw ... 15 years ago ? Yeah . I was a size 2 , and you had your hair down to your shoulders . Things change . From now on , you take the long way around You know , Grace , I just wish that you 'd , you know stop worrying . Marry me , Gracie . Of course I will . Yo , what are you doing in our park , man ? Your park ? Ju give up your wallet . You 're mugging me ? Now you 're catching on . Seven bucks ? It 's all I have . * So long ago * * Another life * * I can feel your heartbeat * * It 's not a dream * * Remember us * * I can see it inour eyes * * We 'll find our place in time * * Our place in time beyond the sun * * We 'll find our place in time * * Our place in time to call our own * So the complaints started right after her foster parents brought her back to quarantine last week . Well , what kind of complaints ? Well , for instance , yesterday , Maia was talking to an employee in the cafeteria . She told her her daughter would be in the hospital soon , but that she 'd be okay . The next day , the little girl was in a car accident . So you 're saying what ? She-She 's got some kind of second sight ? I 'm saying I have five stories just like that one . Why disappear a little girl from the 1940s , hold her for 60 years , and then send her back with the ability to predict the future ? I mean , what were they thinking ? " They " ? We don 't even know if there is a " they . " He , she , it - take your pick . Somebody 's behind this . You know , let 's leave that for the team in the theory room , huh ? Yeah , when they 're not playing video games . Oh , that 's why they 're intimidated by you , Tom . They feel your hostility . Good . I wouldn 't worry too much about the big brains . Just talk to that girl . Thanks . I never meant to scare anymore . We know that , sweeti But why did you say those things to Mrs. Krause about her daughter ? Because they 're true . But how did you know ? I just do . If I asked you whether it was going to rain next Sunday , would you know the answer ? Maybe . I don 't know . What 's going to happen to me now ? The doctors here are going to take another look at you . Oh , don 't worry . It won 't hurt . I don 't believe you . It 's going to hurt , isn 't it ? You might be uncomfortable some of the time , but mostly , oh , it 's just going to be boring . Will you look in on me every now and then ? Me ? To see that I 'm all right ? Sure . It 's expensive , though . The rental vouchers will cover it . So ... do you have any questions ? Um , the small bedroom - do you think it 'll get too much light for a nursery , I mean ? It 's a northern exposure , so you should be all right . So , what do you think ? I like it . Me , too . Is this your first baby ? Oh , we 're not actually a couple . Oh , uh , so , it 's just you and the baby ? No , it 'll be the three of us . Why not ? You can 't stay in that hotel forever . We can share this place . Unless you don 't want to . No . No , I 'd like that . Great . I 'll go do the paperwork . I hope I didn 't barrass you . No , it 's ... it 's not that . It 's , uh ... It 's just , I figure he wouldn 't rentou the place if I was part the deal . I know , I know . It 's not 1951 anymore . Times have changed , but ... Sometimes I 'm just surprised at how much . Good . It 's settled then ? Oh , God . Lily ? Lily , what is it ? No . Oh . Lily . No , I ... I don 't feel so good . You need to sit down . Should I call a doctor ? No , no . No , I ... I just have to leave . And go where ? Anywhere but here . Carl , where have you been ? I got mugged . Oh , God , are you all right ? Did they hurt you ? No , I didn 't get hurt . They got hurt . Who did ? Grace , I learned something tonight , something important . I 'm a different man . Those aliens - or whoever took me - they did something . They took me ; they changed me . They made me better . I think first thing in the morning you should call the counselor and make an appointment . What ? No . I don 't have time for that . I got things to do . What kind of things ? The park , Gracie . I want to make it like it was before . People will bring their kids there again . You and me - we can have our picnics at the old spot . Carl , you 're scaring me . There 's nothing to be scared of , not anymore . Linda , any idea why Dr. Mayhew wants to see us ? He didn 't say . So how have you been ? Good . My lawyer was asking if you 'd signed those divorce papers yet . I thought maybe if we had dinner some night , you know , we could ... sign them together . Oh , you mean make plans that you 'd cancel at the last minute ? I 'll bring the papers , we 'll have a good meal , a couple glasses of wine ... And a good cry ? That , too . Stefano 's ? Where else ? Tom , Linda - thanks for coming in . I was reviewing Carl 's EEG readout , and I noticed something peculiar . What now ? Well , it seems last Thursday night he had a momentary burst of increased brain activity . It was brief - no more than a few seconds . That 's good , isn 't it ? Technically , yes . Let 's not get ahead of ourselves . I 'm going to run some tests , see if I can find out what happened . Tests - we 've had three years of tests . I understand your frustration , Linda , but we really need to look into this . It 's a roller coaster , isn 't it ? It never ends . Linda ... So , Stefano 's , right ? How does Thursday night sound ? 70 ? I 'll be there . Dorothy ... Yeah ? Did anyone visit my son last Thursday night besides his mother and me ? Let me check . Yes , he had one other visitor : Your nephew Shawn . Shawn ! Yeah , I went and s Kyle on Thursday night . He 's my cousin . I wanted to see him . What about it ? And nothing happened while you were there ? Well , I was ly there for a couple minutes . So , you saw nothing , did nothing ? What could I have done ? The day of your welcome home party , a bird smacked into the window , remember ? Yeah , it was stunned . at about it ? No , it wasore than that . And then ... you picked it up and suddenly , it was alive and well . What the hell did you do to Kyle ? I didn 't do anything to him ! Look , look , I really like these little chats we have , Uncle Tommy , but I got to go to class . Shawn . We 'll talk again . Oh , I can 't wait . A bunch of us are going to see Fountains of Wayne this weekend . Have fun . You know , um , this whole loner thing is so tired . Well , it works for me . Fountains of Wayne ! Friday night ! What is with you ? Why do you keep pushing him like that ? Someone has to . I don 't see you doing anything . Well , I 'm giving him his space . Let him figure things out for himself . You should try it sometime . Oh ... ! Marco . Skouris - good . I checked out your idea . What idea ? So , am I a genius , or am I crazy ? We don 't make that distinction in here . of disappearance sites on the West Coast , like you suggested . Turns out you were right . The avity at those sites is weaker . But according to the interferometer , only by five parts per billion . That 's barely measurable . Not to mention barely understandable . English , please . The gravity is changed at some of the places where people disappeared . The question is did it change naturally , or was it articially manipulated . Now , if the gravity was manipulated , the question then becomes by who . So we 're back to the possibility of alien abductions . I wouldn 't rule out little green men , but obviously I 'm going to need to take more measurements . So , in other words , you 've made no progress . Uh , you explain it to him . Oh , hold on . You remember Adam Kensington ? The , uh , insurance guy Orson Bailey killed ? Yeah , what about him ? Not one of the good guys , as it turns out . He was point man in a huge insurance scheme to defraud tens of thousands of policyholders . Orson Bailey saved the State of Washington like , a billion-dollar buyout . Could 've been Enron all over again . God , that 's interesting , 'cause that brings up all kinds of possibilities . Well , uh , don 't be a stranger . Oh ... So , this thing about Bailey . Are you trying to say whoever sent him back meant him to go after Kensington ? It 's a theory . That 's why they call it " the theory room . " That 's tight . Oh , no , I suck . Hey , if this is about the , uh , concert thing ... No , no , no , it 's got nothing to do about that . I just want to know what 's going on with you and Nikki . Me and Nikki what ? I just want to know what 's going on between you two . Well , what do you think 's going on ? Something . She 's always talking about you . Can 't go anywhere or do anything without her wanting to bring you along . How is that my problem , Danny ? Just do me a favor . Leave her alone , okay ? Oh ... I thought that 's what I 've been doing . Look , Danny , you got a problem with your girlfriend , go talk to her about it , okay ? Hey , uh ... we 're the same age . I 'm not your little brother anymore . Then stop ting like a two-year-old . You 're my brother . She 's your girlfriend . It 's all good ... right ? Yeah , right . Oh , Richard , I am so glad we found this place . And now that we got an apartment , we can get you a computer . Forget abouthe computer . I still think we need to get you to a doctor . I 'm fine . I know this is going to sound strange , but that other place we looked at - the baby didn 't like it . Marnal instinct 's kicking in already , huh ? No , it 's not that . It 's that somehow ... I know what the baby 's thinking . Lily , the baby 's barely two months along . It 's not thinking anything . Look , I can 't explain it any more than you can explain ... where you 've been for the past 50 years or , or what 's happened to any of us during the time we 've been gone . I don 't sound too strange , do I ? Of course not . Lily ? I used to rock Heidi like that when she was a baby . It feels like yesterday , but it wasn 't , was it ? No . It was ... what , 11 years ago ? I want to see Heidi . I miss her . Lily , give it some time . Once Brian is used to you being back , he 'll drop the restraining order . Shut up . Just shut up ! Stop it ! Cut it out ! It isn 't funny ! Shut up ! Just shut up ! Grab her legs , man . Hey , guys . Why don 't you leave her alone ? Get lost ! No . You get lost . Go get him , man . Come on . Hey , Maia . How long have they left you like this ? A while . I think they all wt on their coffee break . Well , you know ... that 's pretty dumb of them , isn 't it ? Will you stay until they come back ? Of course . And when they show up , your doctors and I , we 're going to have a little talk . And then can I go home ? Home ? With you . I don 't like being here alone . You want to come and stay with me ? You don 't like being alone , either . I can always come back for my checkups . Please . Look , Maia ... I 'm not even sure I 'm the kind of person I want to live with . No , I-I eat cold pizza for breakfast and ... That sounds all right to me . Yeah , you know , Maia ... Just let me think about it , okay ? Where have you been ? I was looking in on Maia . Really . Well , I promised her , didn 't I ? So , what do you got ? Sid e-mailed the latest rearch clippings to us . I think I found something worth checking out . One guy taking on three attackers doesn 't sound that farfetched . I know , but if you saw him you 'd think it was impossible . He was , uh , 35 , 40 . Maybe 5 ' 6 " . Wehed 150 pounds . So not exactly The Rock , huh ? But it was the way that he moved . Could he have been on some kind of drug , maybe PCP ? He didn 't act like he was on drugs . You know , most guys would have walked away , or , uh , maybe called the cops , later , after it was too late , but , uh ... this guy - he saved me . I 'm sorry . Baldwin . Linda . Dinner , yeah . No . Linda , I 'm so ... Don 't hang up , Linda . Just , just ... Is there anything else you can remember ? There is one thing . This guy , I don 't mean to be rude or anything , but , uh , he smelled funny . Like day-old fish . So that was your wife on the phone ? Excuse me ... I don 't want to talk about it . Fair enough . So what , are we in Orson Bailey territory here ? Well , I wouldn 't rule it out . Which would give us what ? A telekinetic insurance salesman , a clairvoyant eight-year-old and now some kind of sad-sack super-vigilante . Hell of a trio . And those are only the ones we know about . Unless you can think of anyone else . Just take it one case at a time . Heidi , do you remember the formula for an isosceles triangle ? Hey , buddy . I saw that . Richard ... Lily - Thank God . Are you all right ? I been worried sick . Where are you ? I 've been arrested . Carl ... I have my grandchildren coming for dinner . Uh , how ' bout some nice swordfish ? You can 't go wrong with swordfish . Carl ! Uh , give me a second , Burt . You got , like ... What did I tell you about chatting with customers when there 's work to be done ? Stop with the finger . Stop ... I asked you not to do that . Let go . I mean it . I show up on time . I do my work . Now just leave me alone , okay ? Okay , okay . So , how much swordsh are we talking here ? I 'm telling you , Tom , there 's a lot of chatter in DC about putting the 4400 back in quarantine . Not that I agree . I mean , if they 're so dangerous , how is cramming th all into one space going to make us any safer ? So I took my pistol and I shot her in the forehead . Shot who ? Do us a favor , Tom . Sign the divorce papers . Do me a far , Dennis . Stay out of it . I spoke to her . What are you doing talking to Linda ? I 've known her for 20 years . I danced with her at your wedding . Now I 'm not supposed to talk to her . I was in the middle of an investigation . Tom , you asked her for dinner , and you stood her up . It slipped my mind . Maybe . Maybe you just don 't want to admit the truth to yourself . Brian Moore ? Yeah . I 'm Richard Tyler , a friend of Lily 's . Are you another one of those 4400 ? Is that a problem ? Look , I warned her ; I told her to stay away , but she wouldn 't listen . I understand you 're set , but Lily 's in jail . You don 't want that . What I want is a normal life for my daughter , for my family . She made a mistake . It won 't happen again . I 'm just supposed to take your word for it ? I promise , you drop the charges ... she 'll never bother you or Heidi ever again . You used to love her once , remember ? Yeah , I remember . I want you to stop . I can 't . What do you mean , " can 't " ? What you 're doing is dangerous , not to mention illegal . You can 't just go around beating people up . I 've been given an oppornity here , Gracie , and I 'm going to take it . I 'm going to clean up that park , and when I 'm finished , I 'm going to clean up the whole neighborhood . Oh , God . You sound like a crazy man . You promised me you 'd call your counselor . I never said that . You said that . Come tomorrow , I 'm going to call him . You 'd call Homeland Security on me ? If that 's what it takes . The way you 're acting , can you blame me ? What I 'm doing here I 'm doing for us , Grace . This is where we live . I just want us to be happy and to not be afraid anymore , and it starts with Bradley Park . And I don 't want it to end there . It won 't . I won 't let it . They can 't hurt me . No one can . Oh ... You 're just one man . I lost you once , and I don 't want to lose you again . I can do it . I can make this neighborhood safe again . For you , for Mrs. Martino ... even Burt . So please , stop worrying . This is what I was meant to do . This is my destiny . * ... or is this your way * * To hide a broken heart ? * * Many dreams * * Have been brought to your doorstep * * They just lie there * * And they die there * * Are you warm , are you real * * Mona Lisa ... * This was brand-new when I disappeared . And it 's a ... What 'd you call it , a ... ? Golden oldie . Oh . I guess I 'm a golden oldie , too . No , not to me . Lily , we have to talk about what happened last night . No , there 's nothing to talk about . Do you know what I saw when I looked through Brian 's window ? A happy family . I realized Heidi doesn 't need me . Well , maybe one day she ... Yeah , I 'll be there r her , if she does . But until then , I ... I 'll stay away . This is where I want to be now . Here with you . Where I 'm happy , and the baby 's happy . Well , that makes three happy people then . All you 've done for me ... it 's not because I remind you of the other Lily , is it ? Maybe at first . But now all I see is you . * Mona Lisa * * Mona Lisa . * Danny 's inside . I 'm not here to see Danny . Cute . Could you turn it back on , please ? Did Danny say something to you ? Is that why you 're acting like this ? Because our friendship has nothing to do with him . Nikki ... we don 't have a friendship , okay ? Shawn , listen to me ... Hey , hey , hey , come here . Let me see . Let me see . Let me see what 's going on . It 's okay . It 's okay . Let me see . It 's gone . It doesn 't hurt anymore . Must not have been that bad of a burn . Yes , it was . You did something to it , didn 't you ? * ... And be the one who catches all your tears * * That 's why I need you to hear * * I 've found out a reason for me * * To change who I used to be * * A reason to start over new * * And the reason is you . * Tom . See , the thing about vigilantes is that they 're not very common , except in Charles Bronson movies , so I had to create my own profile . Now , we know he 's a white male , slender , somewhere between 30 and 50 . He probably works a blue-collar job , suffers from low self-esteem , lives in a high-crime area . I 'm with you so far . Right . So I cross - checked my profile with the members of the 4400 in and around the Seattle area , and I came up with 37 names . You 're not going to take me through all 37 , are you ? Of those 37 , I was able to eliminate 24 - I 'm sure you don 't care how - and that left me with 13 . I 'm on the edge of my seat . Here are my o favorites . Robert Laurenzano and Carl Morrissey . They both fit the profile , but Carl - he 's our guy . Check out his occupation . Supermarket employee . Yeah . I called the store . Carl works in the seafood section . And our guy smelled like day-old fish . Oh , yeah . I 'm good . Hey ! What the hell you doing ? I just cleaned that . What ? Do you know where your husband is ? We 'd like to talk to him . Why ? Any idea where he was Tuesday night ? He was here . You sure about that ? I just told you . Have you heard of the Bradley Park Vigilante ? Wh-What does that have to do with Carl ? You tell us , Mrs. Morrissey . You 're not going to throw him back into quarantine , are you ? We want to help him . That 's funny . That 's all Carl wants to do is help . People grumble . They complain . Nobody does anything . Nobody tries to make anything better except Carl . Where is he , Mrs. Morrissey ? Carl . Grace , I got rid of all the graffiti . Oh , my ... oh , my God , Carl . Oh , you should 've seen it . They , uh ... they were falling like bowling pins . I didn 't see the knife . I don 't know why I didn 't see the knife . Get an ambulance ! It 's a nice night . No , no , no , stay here . Just sit with me . No ... I thought I could clean it up . I thought I could clean the whole neighborhood up myself . I thought that 's why they sent me back here , but I guess I was wrong , huh ? No , no , no , no , no . Yeah . No , don 't leave me , Carl , please . No , no ! No ! I just want you . I just ... I just want you . No , no ! No ! No ... Why take this guy , give him enough extra juice to think he can make a difference , send him back ... Only to get himself killed . What 's the point ? I wish to hell I knew . Grace Morrissey , wife of slain Bradley Park Vigilante Carl Morrissey , revealed today that her late husband was one of the controversial 4400 . Mrs. Morrissey went on to state that her husband was a true neighborhood hero , a sentiment echoed by many area residents . Local law enforcement officials , as well as a spokesperson for the National Threat Assessment Command , refused to confirm or deny Mrs. Morrissey 's statement . Okay , I got the paperwork . Okay , I need you to sign there ... and there ... and initial here ... Mm-hmm . and sign there . So that 's it ? You got Mr. Ryland 's signed approval . That simplifies things . I thought you were one of the doctors . Yeah . I thought you were asleep ... so you sure fooled me . How would you like to get out of here ? Now ? Right now . Look out , look out , look out . Thanks . Where 'Kyle ? Surgery . Dr. Mayhew said he 's got some kind of fluid building up in his skull , and they 're going to try and relieve some of the pressure . What do they mean , try ? They said the draining fluid might not be enough , that ... that-that more might build up , and if it does , then Kyle could suffer permanent brain damage within a week . Uncle Tommy ... Mom 's on the way .

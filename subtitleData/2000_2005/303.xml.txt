 After the matter is over , the images would not disappear completely due to the influence of reversible nerve connection . He will be afraid of looking at himself because of the consistent mood memory . The centre of fear will cause him to develop emotions such as preference and fear . When he is in fear , he will enter the state of false death . - stop breathing . And his heart might even stop beating from functional effects . Because of reversible nerve connection , illusions will stay and he will choose to avoid remembering . How are you , upper classmates ? Chen Ling . I 'm the new captain of the basketball team . I saw you and you 're pretty good at playing . Are you interested in joining the team ? If you were to join , we 'd surely win the college cup . Isn 't that quite a waste of time ? Do we get paid if we win the championship ? Of course not . Then forget it . Didn 't I tell you he was strange ? Is he a little conceited ? Qi Luo . Han Qi Luo . Sorry . Little sweet teacher . Hello . Qi Luo . How did you get to know such a bad kid ? Listen to your teacher . Stay away from him . In the back . Come over . Hurry up . So much stuff . Sorry .. I interrupted you during your class . Oh , yeah . Return this to you . It was a little crumpled .. but I 've made a copy . Thank you . You 're thanking me ? I messed up your drawing . Why thank me ? Sorry .. because .. I didn 't know there was a drawing at the back , so I stuffed it in my pant pocket carelessly . It 's okay . Anyway , it 's only a draft . It 's no use once I paint it on canvas . Useless meaning ... you want to throw it away ? If you 're going to throw it away .. Can you give it to me ? If you really like it .. I can give you the final oil painting . Really ? You 're not kidding me , right ? I 'll paint as fast as I can . Don 't I act somewhat imprudent ? I 'm taking your stuff for no reason . Now that I think it over .. It really feels that way . I don 't have money . What is there that I can use for exchange ? Why don 't I protect you ? Let 's agree on it first . Whatever happens to you in the future .. I will certainly be by your side and help you . Let 's just agree on it . Okay ? Anyway , this is just what I 'm capable of doing . Bye bye . Also .. There 's one more thing I can help you with . It 's ... When you want to fool around .. I can contribute my body for you to use . Free of charge . Bye bye . Can you .. Can you lend me your body ? What did you just say ? I .. I just said .. Can you lend me your body to be my model ? You can come in now . So sneaky like this .. I 'm not used to it . Over there is fine . Do I need to take off my clothes ? No . You only need to take off the jacket . You can just sit here . How do I sit ? However you like . When I said I would lend you my body , I never thought you would waste a heavenly thing and use it for painting . My original intention was .. that the two of us went to do something happy and would make you feel very comfortable . Hey . I heard you hate men . Is it true ? Why do you hate them ? It 's not because you like girls right ? Could you please not twist around ? And stop talking . It 's hard for me to draw with you acting like this . I 'm not a statue like these , I 'm a real person . Have you heard of the Mars prophecy ? Talk . It says that a terrifying King will control this world and the world will be ruled by Mars . What kind of world do you think it would be if it was ruled by Mars ? It seems that you 're more inclined to believe that Mars is evil . It doesn 't matter what I believe in . The world is all messed up anyway . It 'll collapse sooner or later . I also don 't believe the future is going to be that great . So why not .. just come to a flashy and glorified end ? Doesn 't that sound better ? Why hasn 't it happened yet ? This world .. I wonder how it 's going to end . If the world is really destroyed .. Wouldn 't you be devastated ? What happened to your hand ? He 's already fallen asleep , just like that . He acts crazily . And it 's difficult for people to identify him . But he has such a clean face , such a pure face . I can 't sense any trace of malice in it . In this world .. there are many malicious people and you can 't do anything about them . It doesn 't matter how hard they try to pretend . Their malice will be revealed bit by bit and emit a foul smell . 'Appear ' is ' vi ' , an intransitive verb . It 's very easy , right ? Anyone want to volunteer and come up here to construct a sentence ? Chen Ling . Chen Ling . The teacher wants you to go up front . What for ? To construct a sentence . Teacher , let me do it . Don 't be so quick . Let 's give Chen Ling a chance . What 's the matter , Chen Ling ? You 've taken this course for two years . This shouldn 't be difficult for you . Is that right that you can piss people off during the 10-minute recess ? You woke me up . Don 't blame me . This teacher , who appears to be nice , is in reality a terrible person who initiates sexual harrassment to his female students . Quiet ! Quiet ! Stop making noises ! Teacher . I stayed in Los Angeles for eight years when I was eight years old . Hurry up . Isn 't it fun to strike back ? Tong Dao . Tong Dao . It 's time to come back . What were you doing over there ? I was watching the world 's most beautiful thing . You tore apart your clothes again ? Tong Dao . What happened ? You 're not wearing your uniform again . Because this makes me look more normal . Dr. Zhao said you 'd be released from the hospital next week . You 've been here probably for almost two years . Two months short . President , you remember my name . People here , are coming and going , but I remember every kid , and their individual stories . What a coincidence . I 've been looking for a person to answer my question . I once found a drawing left by a previous patient . Do you know who drew it ? Of course , I remember . He was my patient . He 's about your age . When he just checked into the hospital , he dared not to look at mirrors . He broke all the mirrors in the hospital . I wonder how he 's doing now . Chen Ling . You 're leaving ? Yeah . I 'm on my way to work . Then .. I 'll go to your place tonight , okay ? Aren 't we already over ? Bye bye . Okay . I 'll call you if I get home early . Bye bye . Qing Mei . What are you doing ? You still haven 't given up ? Some things will never end . Fortunately , you reacted quickly . Otherwise , you 'd either be dead or half dead at your normal speed . Both your brake lines have been cut off . Does someone have a grudge against you ? Too many to count . You better be careful . Do you still race ? Bike out of service . No money . How can I race ? Did you fight with your dad again ? Yeah . I just don 't get along with him . And he keeps bugging me to quit riding motorcycles all the time . He 's just worried about you . Why don 't you move back home ? Go home ? If I go home , I think I 'd go crazy . But you 're already crazy anyway . True . Good morning , Teacher Fang . Good morning . Good morning , Teacher . Good morning . Good morning , Teacher Fang . Good morning . Good morning , Teacher . It seems that you have more than one side that people don 't know about . What are you talking about ? Stop pretending . I almost ended up lying on a hospital bed . Fortunately , I like thrilling and dangerous things . But .. Dear Teacher Fang . If we 're going to play .. Why not go all out ? If it were me , I wouldn 't leave something unfinished . Oh , yeah . If I remember correctly ... Teacher , you 're driving a white Civic , right ? Be careful driving . Classmates . Classmates .. I 've just heard some news from the administration office that English Teacher Fang has just abruptly quitted . Oh .. Why ? ... Chen Ling . Are you listening to what I 'm saying ? Yeah . Yeah . I 'm listening . I heard you broke up with Vivian , the junior . Is that right ? Why did we break up ? Stop it . I mean it . I mean what I say , too . If you don 't want to say , then forget it . Hey , take me for a ride on your bike sometime . Uh .. No . My bike gets jealous when I let girls ride on it . And then it knocks me off to the ground . Oh , sorry . What are you doing ? You 're bleeding . How clumsy . By what you were doing , you 've put her in a very dangerous position . Do you know that ? Dangerous ? Oh , you 're referring to that ? That 's a habit I have since my childhood . What a strange habit . It 's not as if you 're ugly and nobody wants you . So why do you like a simple and conservative girl who doesn 't know how to take care of herself ? Let me tell you . If anything happens to Qi Luo because of you , I won 't get involved . Why are you so concerned about her ? You like Qi Luo . Don 't you ? What are you talking about ? Do I like her ? Yes , you do . I 've suspected it for a long time . One moment you said she was weird . Next , you told me to stay away from her . What about now ? Are you interested in Qi Luo ? Do you like Qi Luo or not ? Whether I like her or not , it doesn 't matter . Since high school .. I 've been a nobody . You 've got quite an attitude lately , Classmate . Don 't think you 're so high and mighty just because somebody 's been a little nicer to you lately . Do you think Ling would be serious with a girl like you ? Hey . What kind of expression is that ? What is that ? Do you think that we 're bullying you ? Say something . I just don 't like the way you look pitiful and miserable . Everyday , you hide in a corner acting pitiful . You also react slowly . I feel sick whenever I see you . You like to act pitiful , don 't you ? Fine . Today , I 'll grant your wish . But I hope you 'll always remember ... Never go near Chen Ling again . Classmates . Class begins . Han Qi Luo didn 't come ? She usually doesn 't skip class . Teacher , She won 't be coming today . She won 't be coming ? That 's strange . Even Da Ye and Chen Ling aren 't here . Fine . Let 's get ready to start class . Please take out your textbooks , and turn to page 145 . What happened ? How did this happen ? Was it because of me ? Who did this ? It 's none of your business . It 's all because I 'm too timid ... So people don 't like me . Where do you live ? I 'll take you home . Let 's go . You 're still thinking about staying here , and continuing school ? Don 't tell me you want to go back to class . Didn 't you say you didn 't let people ride your bike ? I 've changed my mind . That 's right . If you get on the bike , you 'll have to be very close to me . You also have to hold me really tight , but yet you don 't like men . Forget it ... if you 're that reluctant . Make sure the helmet 's fastened . Where 's yours ? The bike only has one helmet . You 'd better pray for me not to be caught . Are you ready ? Hold me tight . Qing Mei . There 's motorcycle noise . Lai Qing Mei , what are you doing ? We 're in class . Thank you . Were you scared ? Since I got on your bike , I could only trust you . Fear wouldn 't help . Thank you for willing to trust yourself with me . You like to do insincere , momentary , sweet talk . Thank you for helping me so much . You 've just rescued me . Last time , you said you 'd protect me . I know you didn 't mean it .. but I 'm still very happy about it . They 're very important to me .. because I haven 't been this close to anyone for a very long time . Thank you . Qi Luo . Qi Luo . What are you doing to my daughter ? Mom , you got it all wrong . He wasn 't going to hurt me . Something happened at school . He rescued me and brought me home with his bike . This is my mother . I 'm sorry . I saw Qi Luo looking rather depressed , so ... Aunt , don 't mention it . Oh , yeah . I haven 't introduced myself . I 'm Chen Ling . I 'm Qi Luo 's classmate . Nice to meet you . I 'm at your service . Wow .. So this is what a mother 's hand is . It 's so warm . Qi Luo . Shouldn 't we go up ? Qi Luo . Let 's go . Yes . It 's nothing . I want to ask you .. what you think of Da Ye . What I mean is .. Do you think he 's filthy ? .. Or you really don 't like him ? Why do you think this way ? What I mean is .. nothing . That 's all . You want me to be in races ? Are you sure about that ? I don 't even have a bike . How can I compete ? I 'll get the bike ready . Maintenance and repairs aren 't issues either . All you 're responsible for is riding the bike . Ling . Don 't you want to be a GP rider ? Then you must perform well in some international races before being qualified for GP . I think this time , if we 're lucky , we may be able .. to get an original bike from a manufacturer . Really ? Those manufacturers are looking for some young .. and promising riders to represent them in racers . What do you think ? But I 've been out of it for so long . No problem . I 'll find some people , and form a team . I 'll be in charge of training you . How about that ?

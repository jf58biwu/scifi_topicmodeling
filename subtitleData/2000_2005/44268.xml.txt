HOMELESS MAN : He ain 't done nothing . RUSSIAN LADY : He take bag . Hit . Who took your bag and hit you ? This man ? No , it was some punks , man . They came and ran off . Four-eight , this is Romano . Robbery victim with facial wound . FEMALE OFFICER : I 'd like you to stand there . PROT : Certainly . - Are you traveling somewhere ? - I have arrived . My travels are over , for the time being . - Where 's your luggage ? - I don 't require luggage . FEMALE OFFICER : Do you have a ticket ? Train ticket ? FEMALE OFFICER : Ticket stub ? PROT : I didn 't arrive by train . Would you remove your sunglasses for me , please ? I 'd rather not . I 'd forgotten , but I mean , wow your planet is really bright . - I see . - East forty-two , we have an EDP . - I have to ask you to come with us , sir . Of course . [ Uptempo instrumental music ] Freddy , did you see this fellow come out of a gate ? He didn 't come from no gate . The brother came from nowhere . - You know what I 'm saying ? - Yeah , Freddy , I know what you 're saying . [ Rhythmic , uptempo instrumental music ] ERNIE : I don 't want to go outside . There are things that can kill you . Thank you . You breathe all those chemicals out there , not to mention the cosmic rays and the West Nile virus , and that other one the new airborne pigeon disease nobody wants to talk about . POWELL : Pigeon disease . I 've heard of that . ERNIE : Another thing that 's been bothering me is the food . The cafeteria serves lukewarm food , full of germs . You need to do something about that , Dr. Powell . ERNIE : Heat is the only thing that kills germs . POWELL : Point taken . We 'll look into that . Right away . In the meantime , I want you to start taking your medication again . It 'll help you sleep . And you need to sleep , Ernie . POWELL : Sleep is good . [ Buzzer sounds ] Is our time up ? Only for today , Ernie . Two calls . Your wife : Bring home a bottle of wine . And Dr. Chakraborty : Transfer from Bellevue he wants you to look at . Great . Who is it this time , Jesus Christ or Joan of Arc ? Dr. Chakraborty didn 't say . NURSE : [ Over P.A. system ] Dr. Connolly , call nine . [ Mystical instrumental music ] CHAKRABORTY : He arrived at Bellevue a month ago , suspicion of hallucinogenic intoxication . But he was found negative for substances of any kind . His EKG , his blood value , are all normal . There 's no sign of concussion , brain tumor , no temporal-lobe epilepsy no indication of organic abnormality whatsoever . However , after one month , his amnesia and his delusion have persisted . He claims to be not human . A visitor from another planet . POWELL : They administered Thorazine on him for three weeks at 300 milligrams a day , and he was unresponsive ? How can you be unresponsive to that much Thorazine ? It 's impossible . That 's why they sent him to you . Terrific . No I.D. , no missing person 's report matching his description . What 's this ? CHAKRABORTY : He had it on him . Well , let 's hope extraterrestrials qualify for Medicaid . JOYCE : He 's here , Doctor . POWELL : Thank you , Joyce . Medical record 287 , calls himself " Prot . " - This one 's as gentle as a pussycat , Doc . - Come in . Have a seat . " Have a seat . " Curious expression . Well , let me introduce myself . I 'm Doc ... Dr. Mark Powell Chief of Clinical Psychiatry of the Manhattan Psychiatric Institute . Good . You know where you are . Well , now , Prot , is it ? - Prot . - I see . Prot . POWELL : Well , Prot , we 're here to ... PROT : May I ? Please . PROT : Red Delicious , you call this variety . It 's my favorite . POWELL : I 'd like to begin by asking you if you know why you 're here . Of course . You think I 'm crazy . We prefer the term " ill . " - Do you think you are ill ? - A little homesick , perhaps . Really ? Where is home ? - K-PAX . - K-PAX ? PROT : Capital " K " hyphen , capitals P-A-X . K-PAX is a planet . But don 't worry . I 'm not going to leap out of your chest . I 'm not worried it 's just that I 'm only familiar with nine planets . PROT : Actually , there are 10 . But that doesn 't matter . I 'm not from your solar system . K-PAX is about 1,000 of your light-years away from here . - In what you call the constellation Lyra . - That 's quite a ways . I 'm curious . How did you get to Earth ? PROT : It 's a matter of harnessing the energy of light . I know that sounds crazy to you . You beings are eons away from discovering light travel . You travel at the speed of light ? No . We can travel many times that speed , various multiples of c . Otherwise , the trip here would have taken about a 1,000 years now , wouldn 't it ? What if I told you that , according to a man who lived on our planet named Einstein that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light . I would say that you 've misread Einstein . May I call you Mark ? You see , Mark , what Einstein actually said , was that nothing can accelerate to the speed of light because its mass would become infinite . He never mentioned entities already traveling at the speed of light , or faster . - At tachyon speeds . - Tachyon ? I detect a note of skepticism , Dr. Powell . Not at all . It 's just that you speak English so well . I 'm amazed . PROT : English isn 't that difficult a language to learn . You should try speaking Ackssoneeahayoohahhehhh . I 'm confused . Maybe you can explain it to me . How is it that , being a visitor from space , you look so much like me or anyone else from Earth ? - Why is a soap bubble round ? - " Why is a soap bubble round ? " For an educated person , Mark , you repeat things quite a bit . Are you aware of that ? A soap bubble is round because it is the most energy-efficient configuration . Similarly , on your planet , I look like you . On K-PAX , I look like a K-PAXian . Prot , why did you want to come to our planet ? Well , I 've been here many times before . But what brought me here first ? I don 't know . Pure curiosity , I guess . I 'd never been to a Class BA-3 planet before . POWELL : Class BA-3 ? PROT : Early stage of evolution . Future uncertain . RUSSELL : " And if I give all of my possessions to feed the poor ... " ERNIE : Howie , go on , talk to him . Go on . You 're really from up there ? Indeed . I am from K-PAX . What sort of place is it ? K-PAX is bigger than your planet . But we are circled by seven purple moons . SAL : Bullshit . Bullshit . Go on . Well , K-PAX is most lovely when K-MON and K-RIL are in conjunction . Those are our two suns , what you would call Agape and Satori . [ Subdued instrumental music ] - You finish your homework , Gabby ? - Yeah . NATALIE : I lost another tooth . POWELL : Maybe the tooth fairy will come tonight . There 's no such thing as a tooth fairy . It 's just you and Mom . I fed them already . They couldn 't wait . How was your day ? POWELL : The 6 : 15 was late , didn 't leave the station till 6 : 30 . I should 've caught the nearest beam of light . RACHEL : Should 've caught what ? POWELL : Nothing . How was your day ? Good . Sent the deposit in . For the house in the Cape , last two weeks of August . Which is perfect , since Gabby gets out of camp on the 15th . - You sent the deposit in ? - Yeah . Come on , Rach . That wasn 't definite . We were just talking . I said maybe . - Maybe sometime in August looked good . - Maybe . Maybe we should start paying you for your time . You got a family rate ? Look they published my letter . I spoke with Natalie about going into the after-school program next year in case I go back to teaching . And this morning my head fell off , but I sewed it back on with dental floss . RACHEL : Waxed , of course . POWELL : Dental floss ? POWELL : Sorry , I wasn 't listening . RACHEL : I know . Let 's just eat . The train was late , I 'm tired , and the city 's dumping patients on us . I know . You stink . Have a nice day , Sal . PROT : I 've been to 64 planets within our galaxy . Earth is the only one with your species , homo sapiens , that I 've visited so far . POWELL : And when did you arrive on Earth ? PROT : Four years and nine months ago . POWELL : So , that makes you how old ? PROT : In Earth terms , 337 years old . I aged about seven getting here , traveling at six multiples of c . But really , Marko , it only seemed like an instant . FLEEN : Marko ? PROT : Time being warped at super-light speed . Well , I say Axis 1 psychosis , NOS . That 's glib , to call him a psychotic . That 's a wastebasket diagnosis . He believes he traveled here from another planet . What 's your diagnosis ? Jet lag ? How come he didn 't respond to the Haldol ? Haldol can make you more psychotic . It 's rare , but it does happen . Look , I 'm not saying that medication can 't be useful to help somebody like this . But you can 't go ... What about the Betazine protocol ? The drug 's on clinical trial . You want to experiment on him before we have a diagnosis ? - Do you have some other idea ? - Well , he 's not a danger to anyone . How about getting to know him first ? In the meantime , we have 10 new transfers to take care of . POWELL : You know , maybe what 's wrong with him is that he is . VILLARS : Is what ? POWELL : From the planet K-PAX . [ Laughing and chuckling ] VILLARS : Davies , 517 . Have a look . [ Mystical instrumental music ] Your produce alone has been worth the trip . Could you tell me a bit about your boyhood on K-PAX ? Where were you born ? You were born , right ? K - PAXians have babies . Yes . Much like on Earth . But unlike you humans , the reproductive process is quite unpleasant for us . Could you compare it to something I might understand like a toothache ? It 's more like having your nuts in a vise except we feel it all over . And worse , the sensation is associated with something like your nausea accompanied by a very bad smell . The moment of climax is like being kicked in the stomach and then falling into a pool of mot droppings . Mot droppings ? A mot is a being much like your skunk , only far more potent . If it 's such a terrible experience , how do you reproduce ? As carefully as possible . What are you doing ? You just reminded me of something I want to include in my report . Your report ? It 's our custom to compile descriptions of the various places and people we encounter throughout the galaxy . - ' Morning , Betty . - Good morning , Prot . - ' Morning , Navarro . - What 's up , man ? Friedman . ' Morning , Maria . I 'm Vanessa . 'Morning , Bess . ERNIE : She doesn 't talk to anybody . Afraid smoke will come out of her mouth when she talks . Been here since she was a little girl . Burned her house down . Playing with matches . Very dangerous . It was an electrical fire . Why do you make up stories like that ? Ernie has a very powerful imagination . MRS. ARCHER : Philistine ! SIMMS : Come on , Doris . You got to come out of your room sometime . Look what I brought , just for you . MRS. ARCHER : Boo , boo ! Boo , poo ! SIMMS : Do that again , you go up to three . Her Royal Highness never comes out of her room , not even to eat . No wonder she 's in here . Every day coming up here , she won 't eat . I hate that bitch . The service here is atrocious ! Good morning , Mrs. Archer . Doris . Well , I wasn 't expecting any gentlemen callers until this afternoon . Excuse me . PROT : You have a place set for two . Yes . - I 'm expecting someone . - How long have you been waiting ? Eleven years . Some around here might call that crazy but I prefer to call it romantic . - Romantic . - Like a waltz in the moonlight ? Or a candle-lit dinner . A sunset ? We have those . On K-PAX , we have two suns . They rise together only once every 200 years . Now , that is quite a sight . CHAKRABORTY : He most definitely has a sensitivity to white light . But I think it 's his range that you 'll find interesting . What am I looking at ? He can detect light at a wavelength of up to 300 to 400 angstroms ultraviolet . Of course , Prot 's explanation is that due to his planet 's peculiar quality of light caused by its two suns K - PAXians are used to light conditions much like our twilight most of the time . Wait a minute . Chuck , I didn 't think human beings could see ultraviolet light . We can 't . [ Uptempo , mystical instrumental music ] Good morning , Joyce . That 's a lovely configuration you 're wearing today . Thank you . Macy 's . POWELL : Come in . PROT : This is so much better . It 's a lot like home . POWELL : Well , Prot , I was hoping you 'd tell me more about home . Well , what would you like to know ? POWELL : Do you have a family on K-PAX ? It doesn 't work on K-PAX the same way it works here . On K-PAX , we don 't have families in the way that you think of them . In fact , family would be a non sequitur on our planet , as it would on most others . In other words , you never knew your parents . On K-PAX , children are not raised by their biological parents , Mark , but by everyone . They circulate among us , learning from one , and then another . - Do you have a child ? - No . Do you have a wife waiting back for you on K-PAX ? Mark , Mark . You are not really listening to what I 'm saying to you , are you ? We do not have marriage on K-PAX . There are no wives . There are no husbands . There are no families . I see . So , what about a societal structure ? Government ? No , there 's no need for one . - You have no laws ? - No laws , no lawyers . How do you know right from wrong ? Every being in the universe knows right from wrong , Mark . But what if someone did do something wrong ? Committed murder ? Or a rape ? How would you punish them ? PROT : Let me tell you something , Mark . You humans , most of you , subscribe to this policy of " an eye for an eye . " " A life for a life . " Which is known throughout the universe for its stupidity . Even Buddha and Christ had quite a different vision but nobody pays much attention to them , not even the Buddhists or Christians . You humans , sometimes it 's hard to imagine how you 've made it this far . [ Soft instrumental music ] STEVE : You guys be careful . ABBY : Kids , let 's go . ABBY : The hot dogs are ready . JOSH : Good job ! RACHEL : Where were you , just now ? - Come on . - Okay . Kids , come on . Wash up . Okay . Josh ! Now , come on . Quit teasing the dog . STEVE : Josh , settle down now . ABBY : Let 's go . POWELL : Here we are . ABBY : Great . STEVE : Park that right here . - That looks terrific . - That looks great . Steve , how was your trip up from Princeton ? STEVE : Not too bad . POWELL : Yeah ? - We stopped by to see Michael . - That was nice of you , Sis . - Quite a detour for you guys . - Well , it was his birthday . I know it was his birthday . I sent him a card , and a nice big check as usual . It wouldn 't kill you to pick up the phone every once in a while and talk to your own son . Thank you , Abby . You want to pass the potato salad , please ? There you go . By the way , I put him through Dartmouth . He knows how to pick up a phone , too . - I might invite him for Christmas . - Great . I thought he ... He spends Christmas with his mother . POWELL : He won 't come here . How do you know ? When was the last time you asked him ? I 'm on the couch here ? POWELL : Want a beer ? STEVE : Please and thank you . ABBY : You want some more ? STEVE : Can I have a corn dog ? I have a rather unusual favor to ask you . - What can I do you for , Dr. P ? - I have a patient . Sit down . POWELL : I have this patient who seems to know quite a bit about your field . You have a patient who 's an astronomer ? STEVE : So , tell me about this patient of yours . Well , he claims to come from a planet he calls K-PAX . GABBY : What kind of name is that ? NATALIE : K-PAX ? He says it 's 1,000 light-years away , near the constellation Lyra . Big head , green ? About this high ? I know the guy . No , he 's very convincing . I mean , of course , he 's human . It 's just that he 's , well , he 's the most convincing delusional I 've ever come across . And if I can prove to him that this K-PAX is just a figment of his imagination then maybe I can find out who he really is . STEVE : Sure . I can give you a whole list of questions to ask your fellow . POWELL : Wonderful . McALLISTER : All his books and papers and all are spread out over the desk like always but he 's just sitting there . Did someone change his medication ? McALLISTER : I gave him his usual , Anafranil , 250 milligrams . POWELL : Well , something 's wrong with him . An obsessive-compulsive doesn 't just sit there looking out the window . Howie ? Good morning , Dr. Powell . POWELL : Good morning . Are you looking for something ? - The bluebird . - The bluebird ? The Bluebird of Happiness . Prot told me to find the Bluebird of Happiness . Prot told you . HOWIE : It 's a task . The first of three . I don 't know what the other two are yet . He 'll tell me . If I complete all three I 'll be cured . [ Uptempo , mystical instrumental music ] PROT : There , Ernie , maintain your breathing . That 's it . Now , you see ? There are none of the ammonia particles that you 're worried about . In the first place , I would be able to see them , and I don 't . ERNIE : Winged monkey , 7 : 00 . SAL : Yeah , well , take a bath . Take a bath . Ernie , would you excuse us for a moment , please ? POWELL : Good to see you outside , Ernie . ERNIE : Thank you . SAL : Ernie , you stink . POWELL : Prot it 's one thing to be interested in your fellow patients . It 's quite another to make them think that you can cure them . You seem overly upset , Mark . To borrow a phrase from Navarro , " You need to chill . " For your information , all beings have the capacity to cure themselves , Mark . This is something we 've known on K-PAX for millions of years . Listen to me . On this planet , I 'm a doctor . You 're a patient . Doctor . Patient . Curious human distinction . It 's not your job to cure Howie , or Ernie , or Maria , or anyone . It 's mine . Then why haven 't you cured them yet ? By the way , here are the answers to the questions you asked me . I hope they meet your satisfaction . [ Soft piano music ] STEVE : I don 't know what to say , Mark . STEVE : This is pretty wild stuff . POWELL : Gibberish ? Well not exactly . See , your patient indicates his planet , K-PAX , orbiting an eclipsing binary star system , Agape and Satori near the constellation Lyra . He could 've looked that up , right ? That 's the funny thing , Mark . Not really . Except for my boss , Duncan Flynn one of the foremost astrophysicists in the world and maybe , two or three of his colleagues nobody knows much about the possibility of planets in this star system yet . It hasn 't even been reported in any journals . STEVE : Tell me , honestly , did Duncan put you up to this ? You know , like a joke ? No , it 's no joke , Steve . Tell me , do you know of any missing astrophysicists ? [ Steve chuckles ] STEVE : Can 't say I do . But there 's one or two around here who 'd like to meet your fellow . POWELL : Thanks a lot , Steve , I sure appreciate it . [ Natalie plays the piano and Rachel sings the notes ] PROT : Unlike you humans , the reproductive process is an unpleasant one for us . POWELL : In what way is it unpleasant ? PROT : It 's a pain . RACHEL : Good . Okay . Good . [ Natalie continues playing piano ] RACHEL : Okay . Good . Not too fast . NATALIE : Okay . [ Dreamy , mystical instrumental music ] [ Mystical , rhythmic instrumental music ] NAVARRO : So , this is your neighborhood ? POWELL : Hello , gentlemen . Sure appreciate you meeting with us . FLYNN : Thank you , Doctor . We 'd like to get to the bottom of this as much as you would . POWELL : Thank you , Doctor . Great , let me introduce you to Prot . It 's a pleasure to meet you , Prot . I 'm Dr. Becker . This is Dr. Flynn . Doctors Patel and Hessler . Doctor , Doctor , Doctor , Doctor . How many doctors are there on this planet ? [ Steve laughs ] [ Soft , mystical instrumental music ] NAVARRO : Oh , man . It 's cool , man . Look at this . STEVE : Here you go , Prot . Have a seat . NAVARRO : Oh , shit . Feel at home ? We found your notes quite interesting , Prot . And we 'd like to ask you some questions , if that 's all right . Be my guest . FLYNN : Good . Then I 'll jump right in . PROT : Make sure you can swim . Yes , well , let 's start with this idea of light travel , shall we ? What can you tell us about that ? Absolutely nothing . PROT : If I told you you 'd blow yourselves up . Or worse , someone else . You 'd be surprised how much energy is in a beam of light . Then , maybe you could show us how this light travel works . - You mean a demonstration ? - That would be fine . Adios , aloha . - Well , when are you going to ... - I 'm already back . Where I come from , Prot , that 's called the " Fastest Gun in the West " routine . Well , I don 't come from where you come from , Dr. Becker . FLYNN : Prot , you 've indicated in your notes that your planet , K-PAX orbits around the twin stars Agape and Satori near the constellation Lyra . Frankly we 're a bit mystified as to how you gained knowledge of such a planetary system around these stars . Professor , where I come from that 's common knowledge . This was taken from the Hubble . FLYNN : We 've computer-enhanced it , based on Dr. Patel 's readings from telescopes in Chile and Hawaii . It 's the clearest picture we have of where you come from . And what we 'd like is if you could diagram on the light pad the orbital pattern that your planet takes through this system . PROT : My pleasure . [ Soft , mystical instrumental music ] I think that 's right . FLYNN : Steven , could you input that ? STEVE : Already on it . What 's going on ? [ Mystical instrumental music ] PROT : I take it my calculations help explain the perturbations you 've been seeing in the rotation-pattern of your binary star but have been unable to explain until this moment . FLYNN : How ... How could you know this ? How could you ... Every K-PAXian knows this . Just as every child on Earth knows that your planet revolves around your sun . It 's common knowledge , isn 't it ? POWELL : What happened in there ? I mean you ... He could be a savant . There are savants who have painted flawless copies of Rembrandt who couldn 't remember their own names . You don 't believe him , Steve ? STEVE : I don 't know what I believe . But I know what I saw . SAL : I moved it . It 's removed . [ Soft , magical instrumental music ] Bluebird . Bluebird . SAL : No , you just wait till next ... HOWIE : Bluebird . Bluebird ! Bluebird !

VILLARS : What 's going on here , Dr. Powell ? VILLARS : What on earth is out there ? POWELL : Just a blue jay . VILLARS : A blue jay ? PATIENT 1 : That 's right . PATIENT 2 : It is .

Bluebird ? MRS. ARCHER : There is a bluebird ? SIMMS : Come on over . Come on over here . SIMMS : Come on . NAVARRO : That 's right . Help , yes . SIMMS : Come on down the hall , Stevie . It 's okay . PATIENT : Bluebird . BESS : I know who you are . You 're the bluebird . PROT : Good night , Bess . - And how are we today ? - Just fine . PROT : That 's good , Maria . My man . PROT : Excuse me . About that light travel thing I was wondering if you could maybe show me how to do that . SAL : I put up with the stink in this place for 10 years . I want to get out , if you know what I mean . I used to be the doorman at the Plaza . Fifteen years . That 's when I started to notice it . PROT : Notice what ? SAL : The smell . They all stank . And I tried to tell them , but ... They put me here . And ... And this place smells worse than all . Except for you . You don 't smell , so I figured maybe you could help me . You should smell the yort blossoms on my planet in a gentle breeze . Very much like your sugar plums . I would like to smell that . I would like to go there to your planet . I 'm afraid I can only take one person back with me when I go . POWELL : I had my weekly session with Sal today . He says you 're taking him to K-PAX . I 've heard from most of the patients on Ward 2 . They all tell me that they 're going to K-PAX . I wonder if it 's a wise thing to be promising patients in a psychiatric facility ? - No , Mark . I made it clear to every one . I can only take one person back with me when I return . - Return ? Mark , don 't get me wrong . I mean , you 've been very hospitable . Hospital . Hospitable . But my time here is almost up , and I can 't wait to get back . - Back ? To K-PAX ? - Yes , of course . Where else ? - You 're planning to return to K-PAX . - You 're repeating yourself again . I have one trip to take up north and then I am planning to return to K-PAX . Joyce gave me these strawberries this morning from her garden in Hoboken . They are delicious . You 'll have to forgive me , but this is a bit confusing . - When 're you planning on ... - I 'm departing on July 27 . Why ? Why July 27 ? Safety reasons . I can travel on Earth without fear of bumping into someone traveling at super-light speed but beings are coming and going all the time from K-PAX . It has to be coordinated . You 're telling me you 're beaming back to K-PAX on July 27 . At 5 : 51 a.m. , Eastern time . [ Mystical , uptempo instrumental music ] Hey , honey . Mark , you were just dreaming . You were just dreaming . NATALIE : Daddy ? RACHEL : Mark ? RACHEL : Mark , what 's going on ? Daddy 's okay . Go back to bed . - Where is Daddy going ? - He 's all right , his tummy hurts . NATALIE : Daddy . RACHEL : Get in bed . POWELL : When did you arrive on Earth ? PROT : Four years and 9 months ago . PROT : In your years ... RACHEL : What is it ? POWELL : Listen . POWELL : When did you arrive on Earth ? PROT : Four years and nine months ago . PROT : In your years , that would be ... Four years , nine months and three days ago . That 'll be five years to the day on July 27 . That 's when he 's leaving . RACHEL : What ? POWELL : To go back to K-PAX . RACHEL : What is the matter with you ? POWELL : Rachel ... It is 2 : 00 a.m. What 's this patient doing to you ? He 's telling me that five years ago on July 27 something terrible happened to him . Some horrible trauma . I 've got to get to him before that date . GABBY : Mom , what 's happening ? RACHEL : Unbelievable . RACHEL : Nothing . Let 's all go back to bed . RACHEL : Come on . GIRLS : Mom . GABBY : I got it .

I want him to spend the Fourth of July with us . To see if a normal family environment might bring something out of him . - Since when did we become a normal family ? - Please , Rachel . Look , they 're here . - I just feel uncomfortable . - Well , don 't . POWELL : Joyce 's son is on the high-school wrestling team . And Betty 's husband 's an ex-cop . - Hey ! - Hi .

So far ? I mean , he 's not out to set a world record or anything . But the young man in the photograph , he 's not here today . RACHEL : No , he doesn 't live with us . You know , he 's away at college and ... And the truth is , he and Mark don 't talk to each other . I don 't know why I 'm telling you this . Probably because I 'm a locked-up lunatic , so what harm could it do ? Maybe . Maybe that 's it . Dr. Powell has been trying to teach me the importance you beings place on your biological connections . You think he means it ? You don 't ? STEVE : Yeah ! That was a good one , Son . Do you know what a family is ? You worry . They don 't tell you that , you know . You don 't have a family ? No . We don 't have families on K-PAX . You don 't know what you 're missing . I 'll get you some more lemonade . STEVE : Hey , that 's beautiful ! ABBY : Okay . Fourth of July . Thank you for inviting me here today , Mark . You 're most welcome , Prot . STEVE : That 's good . Come on . Come on . NATALIE : Come push me on the swing . STEVE : All right , I 'll send it to you . JOSH : Okay . PROT : Okay , but first you have to hold on very tight . NATALIE : Okay . PROT : You ready ? NATALIE : This is fun ! JOSH : Come on , let 's go . Come on . Watch out . Watch out . Come near the water . PROT : No , don 't ! NATALIE : Come on . PROT : Don 't ! NATALIE : Come on ! PROT : Don 't go ! Stay away ! Don 't go in the water ! - Don 't ! - Let go ! PROT : No , don 't ! No , you stay . No ! RACHEL : Natalie ! Natalie ! NATALIE : Mom ! PROT : No ! RACHEL : Mark ! DANNY : Don 't ! No ! Prot ! Betty , quick ! POWELL : Get back ! Turn off the goddamn water ! ABBY : Stay there , Josh . ABBY : I 'll turn it off . McALLISTER : I got it . POWELL : It 's okay . DANNY : Oh , yeah . POWELL : Prot , it 's okay . It 's okay . No , it 's okay , Betty . POWELL : Where 're his glasses ? STEVE : Here . I got them . POWELL : You 're all right . STEVE : Here you go . POWELL : Prot . POWELL : You 're okay . Is that apple pie I smell ? POWELL : Sweetheart , you okay ? NATALIE : Yeah . He was pushing my daughter on a swing like he had done it 100 times before . Not like he was some alien from K-PAX . I saw him . He was connecting with something . - Some kind of normal life . - That 's not enough . - He 's a violent patient , Mark . - He is not violent . Something violent happened to him . Something in his past . He wasn 't trying to harm Natalie , he was trying to protect her . - From the sprinklers ? - I 'm not sure from what . I need more than a hunch to go on . Otherwise I have to send him upstairs . We need to regress him . Take him back into the past . Find out what happened and have him confront it . VILLARS : Regress him ? Do you have any idea how risky it is to regress a patient like this one ? It 's his only chance . Claudia , we have to push him . There 's no time . He told me that he 's going back to K-PAX on July 27 . That 's in three weeks . I think that he could become violent on that day . Hurt himself , hurt somebody else . You know what the problem is , Mark ? You 're too close to this patient . Everybody else can see it but you . I 'm transferring him to the fourth floor , and that 's final . I know I 'm too close to him , all right ? Fine , I admit it . VILLARS : Why choose this one to save , Mark ? POWELL : I don 't know . Maybe , maybe because I feel he chose me . POWELL : Has anyone seen Prot ? SAL : He went up north for a few days . North ? HOWIE : Greenland . Iceland . You know he had a few countries left to visit before he could finish his report . Don 't worry , Dr. Powell . He 'll be back . How do you know , Ernie ? Because he took his glasses with him , darling . When he returns to K-PAX , he won 't need them . Patients do not escape from this institution . - They don 't escape . - There has been no evidence of escape . But obviously I 've notified the police , Social Services . I 'll have a great time explaining this to the State Board . I got psychotics packing up their sneakers because they think they 're going to K-PAX . - Claudia . - Find him . [ Soft , dramatic instrumental music ] POWELL : What about city shelters ? Have you checked ? No . No , I 'm not telling you how to do your job . Thank you . [ Mystical instrumental music ] PROT : Dr. Powell , I presume . Where the hell have you been ? Newfoundland . Greenland . Iceland . Labrador . All right , cut the crap . We 've been looking for you for three days . I believe I mentioned my taking a trip up north in this very garden . Taking a trip ? You 're a patient here . You don 't leave here without a discharge . And don 't give me this beam of light shit , because I don 't buy it . What would you say if I were to tell you that I don 't believe you took any trip at all to Iceland or Greenland or anywhere . That I don 't believe you 're from K-PAX . I believe you 're as human as I am . I would say you 're in need of a Thorazine drip , Doctor . There is one way you could convince me beyond any doubt . Of course , I would need your consent . It 's called hypnosis . I 'm sorry , I don 't see the point . Let me tell you what your alternative is . A place where they 'll stick a needle in your ass every day which may leave you grinning stupidly for the rest of your days on Earth . Is that what you 'd like ? Prot ? I want to help you . POWELL : What we 're going to be doing , Prot , is a bit like daydreaming . I 'm going to count from one to five . On the count of three , your eyes will close and you will find yourself in a very nice , deep , comfortable , relaxed state of hypnosis . One : Your eyes are starting to get very heavy now . Two : I want you to use your imagination and imagine small lead weights on your eyelids that are just making them so heavy . Pulse rate is 40 BPM . I 'd be concerned if he were human . POWELL : Let yourself go way way down deep . Four : Let a wave of relaxation move through your body now as you go down even deeper . And five : Going way way down deep . You are in a relaxed state of hypnosis now . How do you feel ? Like nothing . I want you to go back in time . I want you to recall the first experience that you can remember . What do you see ? POWELL : What was that ? What do you see ? I see a casket . Silver with a blue lining . Whose casket is it ? It 's the father of a friend of mine . And what 's your friend 's name ? Not telling . Do you know how your friend 's father died ? He had an accident at the place he worked . He was killed in an accident ? POWELL : He was hurt and then died later ? POWELL : Where did he work ? PROT : A place where they kill cows . Where is this place ? The pulse rate just shot up 10 BPM . POWELL : Do you know where this place is ? I want you to relax . I want to move forward in time now . Where are you ? It 's nighttime . We 're in his house . POWELL : At the other boy 's house ? PROT : Yeah . I want him to come outside . Why ? To look at the stars . That 's where I come from , you know . Is your name Prot ? How did you know that ? Where are you from , Prot ? From the planet K-PAX . It 's in the constellation Lyra . Do you know all the constellations ? Yeah , most of them . POWELL : And does your friend know them , too ? Yes , he does . When his dad got sick and had to stay home they got a telescope . His dad taught him about all the constellations . He 's not interested in those right now . Why not ? Something happened . That 's why he called me . He calls me when something bad happens . Like when his father died ? That 's right . How do you know to come ? How does the boy call you ? I don 't know . I just come . I just know . How do you get to Earth ? I want to go outside . Can I go outside ? Read his body language . I don 't think he wants to talk anymore today . All right , I want you to just relax . Think about the stars . That 's right . I 'm going to count backwards now from five to one . You 'll find yourself wide awake . Five : You 're starting to come out of it . Four : You 're feeling more alert . Three : Even more alert . Two : You 're becoming awake now . And one . So , when do we begin ? It 's already over . The old " Fastest Gun in the West " routine . POWELL : Let 's find the locations of all the slaughterhouses in the United States . I mean , how many can there be ? JOYCE : I don 't know . POWELL : We eliminate the ones in or near big cities and we concentrate on small towns , rural areas . Places where you can see the stars . Joyce , we only have six days . MRS. ARCHER : Should I bring the crystal , or leave it here ? I suppose I won 't really need it on K-PAX . I don 't even know what they drink . SAL : Dream on , sister . He can only take one of us . Why would he take a stinker like you ? He 's taking me . How dare you . I do not stink . No , forget it , I 'm the one going . ERNIE : Yeah ? Which one of you ? McALLISTER : Okay . Who would like to begin ? Ernie . I was wondering if it was possible for us to have cream of wheat instead of oatmeal ? SAL : Not again . McALLISTER : Howie . There 's really not much time . I would like to propose an essay contest to decide once and for all who will go with Prot . He 's agreed to read them all by July 27 . If anyone would like to be considered , please state your reasons in a clear legible hand and return them to me . HOWIE : Russell . Bess . MARIA : Damn . RUSSELL : Would I get to take my Bible to K-PAX ? Of course you would . McALLISTER : We can finish the essays later . POWELL : I want you to go back in time again , but not as far back as last time . Is your friend there ? Is he with you now ? Yeah . - What 's his name ? - Not telling . Prot , I would like to know your friend 's name . I ain 't going to tell you . POWELL : We have to call him something . How about Pete ? That 's not his name , but whatever thrills you . What year is it ? 1985 . - How old are you ? - 175 . - How old is Pete ? - 17 . POWELL : Tell me about Pete . What happened ? Is there a problem ? Is that why he called you ? He 's got a girlfriend . POWELL : There 's a problem with the girlfriend ? She 's pregnant . He can see it coming right down the road . You get married , have a bunch of kids , wind up in the job that killed your dad . POWELL : He blames her for this ? No , he doesn 't blame her . How did he put it ? He hates the chains that people shackle themselves with . - We don 't have all that crap on K-PAX . - All right . Prot , listen to me carefully . We 're going to move forward in time again , say two weeks . If you 'd like to open your eyes or move around , you may . Would you like to ? I know that . Prot ... PROT : Well , it 's 1991 , according to your Earth calendar . And your friend Pete called you . Not for anything in particular . He just wants to talk things over with someone every now and then . Tell me about Pete now . He 's a knocker . A knocker ? PROT : The knocker is the guy that knocks the cow on the head so it won 't struggle while they slit its throat . I know . Barbaric , isn 't it ? Does he still live in the same town ? Well , just outside of town . He 's got a little place , but he 's fixed it up nice . It 's got some trees , and a couple of acres and a river . PROT : Reminds me of K-PAX , except for the river . Tell me , did he ever marry that pregnant girl ? Wow , what a memory . Yeah , they got married , but she 's no longer pregnant . That was six years ago . I 've forgotten her name . I didn 't tell you her name . Can you tell me now ? Sarah . POWELL : Did they have a son or a daughter ? Rebecca . It 's her birthday next week . VILLARS : Chuck , what 's happened ? CHAKRABORTY : Howie tried to kill Ernie . What ? He 's fine . Ernie ? I feel wonderful , Dr. Powell , absolutely wonderful . What happened ? My good friend Howie , he nearly strangled me to death . What ? Son of a bitch , I love him . Ernie , I don 't understand . I was asleep , you know the way I like my hands tied and everything ? He wrapped something around my neck , maybe a handkerchief . And then tightened it . There wasn 't a damn thing I could do about it . Well , when I stopped breathing , he lifted me onto the gurney . He rushed me up here , they brought me back as quick as they could . And when I woke up you know what I realized , Dr. Powell ? Dying ... Dying is something you have no control over . Why waste your life being afraid of it ? I 'll sleep on my stomach from now on . I 'll eat fish with bones in it , I 'll swallow the biggest pill you can find . Bring it on . I feel good . That 's terrific , Ernie . - See you at our session tomorrow ? - Yes . I cured him , didn 't I ? Prot says one more task and I 'll be cured , too . And then , it 's bon voyage . [ Soft instrumental music ] Tell me your name , damn it . I 'm going to give you a specific date and I want you to remember where you were and what you were doing on that day . Do you understand ? Perfectly well , my dear sir . The date is July 27 , 1996 . I 'm on K-PAX . POWELL : Are you sure ? Quite sure , Governor . I 'm harvesting kropins for a meal . Kropins are a fungi , like your truffles . Big truffles , delicious . Do you like truffles ? Wait a minute . There it is . - What ? Is it Pete ? - Yes . I sense something is wrong . He needs me . I 'm now on Earth . I 'm with him . Where are you ? What are you doing ? By a river . In the back of his house . It 's dark . He 's taking off his clothes . Why is he doing that ? What ? What is he doing ? He 's trying to kill himself . Why does he want to kill himself ? Because something terrible has happened . Has he done something he shouldn 't have ? He doesn 't want to talk about it . Prot , I 'm trying to help him . I can 't unless he tells me what happened . He knows that . Well , then why won 't he tell me ? Then you would know what even he doesn 't want to know . Then you have to help him . Prot you have to help him tell me what happened . He doesn 't want to talk about it . Are you fucking deaf ? Time is running out for him . Time is running out for everyone . He jumps in . He 's floating . Pulse is up to 140 . Respiration 's at 30 . For God 's sake , bring him back . Right , listen to me . Listen to me . You can save him . You 're his friend . I am his friend . That 's why I won 't try . Save him ! No , I can 't . The current is too strong . There 's no chance . POWELL : Listen to me . You 've helped a lot of patients here , Mrs. Archer you 've helped Howie , and Ernie . Help cure Pete , now . Let 's call it a task . I want you to let me speak to him . If he 's listening I want him to know that he can trust me . That if it was Sarah or Rebecca ... [ Prot yells ] McALLISTER : Get in here . POWELL : No , wait ! Wait , wait ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! It 's okay . It 's all right . [ Prot continues sobbing ] I 'll count backwards now from five to one . And as I count , you 'll become more and more alert . I 'll snap my fingers on the count of one , and you 'll wake up feeling refreshed . Five : You 're starting to come out of it . Four : You 're becoming more alert . Three : Even more alert . Two : You 're starting to wake up now , and one . Are you okay ? Yes , feeling fine . Okay . - God bless you . - Thank you . POWELL : Is this area code 505 ? Where are you ? New Mexico ? POWELL : Salva ... Salvation . Salvation . JOYCE : There are a dozen Salvation Army shelters in New Mexico . Albuquerque , Las Cruces , Roswell . Wait a minute , there 's one in Santa Rosa . Santa Rosa . POWELL : Guelph . That 's pretty close to Santa Rosa . What 's the biggest local newspaper for that region ? " Guadalupe County Observer , covering Guadalupe County . " POWELL : Okay , bring that up . POWELL : Go to July 27 , 1996 . POWELL : " Swap meet , livestock sale . " Wait , go to the 28th . There it is ! " Robert Porter , drowned . " His name is Robert Porter . [ Climactic instrumental music ] Robert Porter . Here it is . I do remember this case . About the biggest thing to ever happen around these parts . Quiet type . As I recall , he was a real smart fellow . Brainy . Strong as a horse though , worked as a knocker . Lived about 20 miles outside of town with his wife and child . POWELL : Sarah . His wife 's name was Sarah . That 's right . SHERIFF : Damn shame what happened . - You got time to take a ride ? - Yeah . SHERIFF : It 's been empty . Nobody comes around here much anymore since all that happened . And there ain 't no living next of kin to give the place to anyway . SHERIFF : I had detectives come down from Albuquerque to try and piece this one together . According to the official story , Porter was at work when this drifter , Daryl Walker , came by the house . He was a two-time parolee , looking for trouble . You know ? Started out as a robbery . The wife and daughter were out back . PROT : [ Echoing ] Becky ? Sarah ? Sarah ? From what we can gather from forensics Walker forced the two women into the house . SHERIFF : Raped the wife . Then killed them both . Porter must have come home and found Walker still here . [ Dramatic and ominous instrumental music ] God . Snapped a grown man 's neck like it was a twig . [ Eerie , mystical vocal music ] SHERIFF : Can 't say I wouldn 't have done the same . [ Eerie , mystical vocal music continues ] [ Melancholy music continues ] The river 's this way . SHERIFF : We found the clothes there . This is probably where he jumped in . This river can be treacherous . Even in July , it 's got a hell of a current . It might have been a mistake officially to declare it a drowning , when the body was never found . Doc , if that boy you got in New York is really Robert Porter I 'd just as soon not know about it . Know what I mean ? [ Melancholy instrumental music ] [ Soft , emotive instrumental music ] POWELL : I 'm sorry . - Don 't do that again . - I won 't . What happened ? I found what I was looking for . You sure ? Wish I hadn 't . [ Elton John 's Rocket Man plays ] MRS. ARCHER : If you don 't mind putting mine on top . Prot . Have a seat . All packed ? Ready to go ? Quite ready . I travel light . That 's a joke , Mark . You humans . There 's just no sense of humor . I doubt Freud ever tried this but when someone goes away , we send them off with a little toast . Scotch okay , or would you prefer something more fruity ? I will try the Scotch . Well , here 's to a safe journey . To tell you the truth K - PAX sounds like a beautiful place . I 'd like to see it sometime . Is there a chance of that ? I think you should see more of your world . Matter of fact , I think you should see more of your own family . Invite your son for Christmas . I may just do that , Prot . You know what I 've learned about your planet ? There 's enough life on Earth to fill 50 planets . Plants , animals , people , fungi , viruses , all jostling to find their place . Bouncing off each other , feeding off each other . Connected . You don 't have that kind of connection on K-PAX ? Nobody wants , nobody needs . On K-PAX , when I 'm gone , nobody misses me . There would be no reason to . And yet , I sense that when I leave here I will be missed . Yes . Strange feeling . POWELL : You don 't have to leave , Prot . I 'm sure there must be some way that I can help you to stay . As one of us . I will miss you , Dr. Powell . I have to finish my report . But I seem to have misplaced my pencil . Take mine . A much more efficient writing tool . Adios , my friend . Prot ? I want to show you something . That is Robert Porter . Prot , that 's you . You and Robert Porter are the same person . That 's patently absurd . I 'm not even human . Can 't you at least admit the possibility ? I will admit the possibility that I am Robert Porter if you will admit the possibility that I am from K-PAX . Now , if you 'll excuse me I have a beam of light to catch . PROT : Oh , Mark now that you 've found Robert please , take good care of him . [ Patients singing For He 's A Jolly Good Fellow ] SAL : I can 't stand this . I can 't stand this ! I demand to know which one of us is going with you . I can tell you this . There are extra points for the one who goes to sleep first . You never gave me my last task . What 's my last task ? To stay here . And be prepared for anything . You look tired , Doc . Why don 't you get some rest ? He 's not going anywhere . - We 've got 7 hours , I 'll see you in 4 . - Get some rest . RACHEL : You 're going to eat . You need some food , and you need to sleep . Chow Fun . From the place on Broadway with the ugly lanterns in the window ? The mean waiter who always shouted at us . POWELL : Fortune cookies never had any fortunes in them . We never needed any . I knew my fortune that night . He was sitting right in front of me . Hope he still is . SIMMS : Hey , Ron . NAVARRO : What 's up ? - $ 20 says he goes . - You 're on . [ Eerie , foreboding instrumental music ] [ Suspenseful instrumental music ] Shit ! Damn it ! Two minutes . - I wonder where Dr. Powell is . - I 'll buzz him . One minute . Here comes Dr. Powell . He 's moving . Repeat . He 's moving . What the hell ? Wait for me ! Son of a bitch . POWELL : Oh , God . NAVARRO : Oh , man . Call a code blue . Help me . Get him . [ Somber instrumental music ] ERNIE : Who 's that ? Beats me . How did he get in here ? MARIA : That 's not Prot . HOWIE : Definitely not Prot . Certainly not . Prot 's gone . Where 's Bess ? SAL : Bess ! He chose Bess . Bitch . ERNIE : Goodbye , Bess . Good for you , home girl . Bess went to K-PAX . POWELL : Patient 287 , Robert Porter . I wish I could say that Robert sat up one fine day and said , " I 'm hungry , got any fruit ? " Like most catatonics , he probably hears every word we say but refuses , or is unable to respond . Nevertheless , I keep him up to date . I told you about Howie . He got that job at the public library . And Ernie , he 's determined to be a crisis counselor . The only one we 're really concerned about is Bess . We check halfway houses , shelters , churches , bus stops . Nothing . I don 't understand . It 's like , people don 't just disappear . July 27 . You wouldn 't happen to know anything about that , would you ? Robert ? No ? Well , maybe it 'll come to you . Whenever you 're ready , I 'll be waiting . [ Soft instrumental music ] PROT : [ Voiceover ] I want to tell you something . Something you do not yet know but we K-PAXians have been around long enough to have discovered . The universe will expand , then it will collapse back on itself . And then it will expand again . It will repeat this process forever . What you don 't know is that when the universe expands again everything will be as it is now . Mistakes you make this time around you will live through on your next pass . Every mistake you make you will live through again and again forever . So , my advice to you is to get it right this time around because this time is all you have . [ Soft instrumental music continues ] You 're looking great , Michael . Think so ? Thanks . How are you doing ? POWELL : Good . How was your trip ? MICHAEL : Good . POWELL : I 'm really glad you could make it . [ Poignant instrumental music ] Subtitles : Filou ; - )

 Feels heavy . Baby 's first tricorder ? Not exactly . Hmm ... Thank you . I 'm sure she 'll love it . What is it ? A pleenok . Vulcans use them to train their infants in primary logic . Never too early to train those synapses , eh , Tuvok ? Here , let me see that . I love a good puzzle . This one 's from Mr. Kim . Starfleet diapers . Standard issue . At least we 'll know who to call if there 's a containment breach . Now that your Borg implants have been removed , you might think about having children of your own one day . One day . I have been considering some less radical changes in my personal life . Such as ? I realize I don 't have a rank , but I would like to request a uniform . Consider it done . The Doctor tells me you don 't need to regenerate anymore . I can arrange some quarters for you , unless you enjoy curling up in the cargo bay . A bed would be more comfortable . Since I arrived on Voyager , your guidance has been invaluable . Thank you , Captain . All I did was chart the course . You were the one who made the journey . Seven . It 's traditional for everyone to share their best wishes for the baby . I thought you might like to start . To the newest member of our crew ... may all her desires be fulfilled except for one ... so she 'll always have something to strive for . - Oh , very good . - Well said . - Hear , hear . - Hear , hear . And may she inherit a sense of logic from her mother . I 'll drink to that . That was strange . Care to explain ? I wish I could . Long-range sensors picked up an energy discharge , but now it 's gone . There . There 's another one . They 're occurring approximately 5.9 light-years ahead . - Source ? - We 're too far to get a clear reading . Bridge to Seven of Nine . Go ahead . Report to the Astrometrics Lab . Acknowledged . Computer , end program . I wasn 't able to find the cause of the discharges , but the region ahead contains unusual amounts of subspace radiation and metallic debris . Vessels ? Not within range , but I 'll have more data once we move closer . I see no reason to alter course . Keep an eye on your sensors . Yes , Captain . Now ... on to more pressing matters . Does B 'Elanna suspect anything ? Not a clue . Good . Mess Hall , 1400 hours . Be on time ; I don 't want to spoil the surprise . I expect both of you to show up . I 'll be busy here . What 's wrong , Seven ? No baby showers in the collective ? I 'm sure you can spare a few minutes . If it 's any consolation , I share your discomfort with social gatherings . They seem to occur with alarming frequency . Mr. Neelix would argue that they improve morale . I have been looking for ways to improve my social skills . Perhaps I 'll attend . Well , it certainly is , uh ... efficient . No clutter . Plenty of room to move around . Eh , but it 's a little impersonal . Don 't you think ? Explain . Well , these are your quarters , Seven . They should reflect your individuality . How about a table and a couple of chairs ? Give yourself a place to work ... entertain guests . Uh , try to add a little color . Uh , uh , photographs , uh , artwork , knickknacks . Knickknacks ? Little things , like the wood carvings in Ensign Kim 's quarters . I 've never been to Ensign Kim 's quarters . But I suppose I could replicate some items and disperse them throughout the room . That 's a start . Some people like to display pictures of family and friends . There 's a photograph of my parents in the ship 's database . I 'll make a copy and place it in a frame . Good , good . A multispectral starchart might enhance this bulkhead . Or a painting . A painting of a starchart . l-l was thinking of something more abstract , more , uh , artistic . Uh , drapes . Nothing livens up a room like good window dressing . Not to mention the added privacy . Privacy ? We 're in space . Well , you never know when we 'll be docking at a crowded spaceport . But we 'll have to make sure that they match the carpet . I 'm thinking of a Talaxian mosaic , uh , tulaberry blue stripes with an orange inlay ... I appreciate your aesthetic insights , but I believe I can proceed on my own . Enter . Am I interrupting ? Please come in . Love what you 've done with the place . We 're in the process of decorating . Maybe this will help . Consider it a housewarming gift . It 's beautiful . What is it ? A dreamcatcher . According to Native American mythology , it wards off nightmares . I 'm impressed . I 've familiarized myself with your culture . Now that you 'll be sleeping instead of regenerating , I thought it might come in handy . I 'm sure it will . Thank you . I 'll let you two find a place to hang that . But it would look perfect right above the bed . Pleasant dreams . It was thoughtful of you to stop by . On move-in day ? I wouldn 't miss it . I suppose this makes you my inaugural guest . I 'd be a negligent host if I didn 't offer you a beverage . Tea ? That might be difficult . No replicator . Another flaw in the decor . I 'll requisition one for you first thing tomorrow . I 'd appreciate that , Commander . Chakotay . We 're off-duty . We can drop the formalities . Yes , sir . I enjoyed your toast today . You 've come a long way . I hope to see more . You will . Good night . Chakotay . As you might know , I 've taken an interest in culinary science . I 'm preparing a meal tomorrow night , and I thought perhaps you could attend ... to evaluate my work . I 'd be happy to . 1900 hours ? I 'll bring the wine ... and the furniture . Then you accept ? It 's a date . Rock-a-bye baby , in the space dock When the core blows , the shuttle will rock When the hull breaks , the shuttle will fall And down will come baby , shuttle and all ... Are you trying to soothe the infant or traumatize her ? The lyrics are rather grim , but it 's the melody they respond to . I recorded 29 in all , including a couple of Klingon lullabies . My favorite is " quong vaj Ocht . " " Sleep , Little Warrior . " I could tell by the look on their faces that my gift made quite an impression . No doubt . I wish you 'd been there . It was a lovely shower . Tom and B 'Elanna were disappointed that you didn 't attend . I was occupied . Are you experiencing any shoulder pain ? Yes . Hmm . Your biradial clamp is out of alignment by .3 microns . I 'm afraid it 'll have to be repaired . Can 't you simply extract the component ? Not if you want to keep using that arm . I know it 's an inconvenience , but until we can find a way to remove your cybernetic systems , they 'll have to be maintained . It 's a minor procedure . We might as well take care of it now . I prefer to wait . We 'll be done in an hour . I have research to complete . Oh . I suppose we can put it off until next week 's physical . I also noticed that your electrolyte levels are down by 12 percent . Have you missed any regeneration cycles ? Last night . Don 't tell me . More ... research ? This must be some project . Mind if I ask what you 're working on ? It 's complicated . How do you mean ? My personal life is none of your concern . I wasn 't aware you had a personal life . Report ? It was an energy discharge , 200,000 kilometers starboard . It produced a level-9 shock wave . Some kind of weapon ? Possibly . Another one , five million kilometers to port . A shock wave is approaching . Full power to the shields . Our warp field 's destabilizing . I 'm detecting another . Distance : 50,000 kilometers . Turn our bow into the wave front . It 'll minimize the damage . Sorry , Captain , there wasn 't enough time . We 've lost warp drive . I 'm reading another . Distance : 26 million kilometers . Too far to pose a threat . If they are weapons , they don 't seem to be directed at us . Or whoever 's firing them is a lousy shot . Astrometric sensors recorded the explosions . I believe it 's a long-range subspace warhead . The debris in this region suggests that dozens have been fired in the last several weeks . The warhead destroyed something . What was it ? It appeared to be an unmanned probe . This is all very intriguing , but I 'd just as soon get out of here before we cross paths with another one of these things . Where do we stand on repairs ? Subspace radiation from the explosions is making it difficult to create a stable warp field . Lieutenant Torres estimates 48 hours . Can you find a way to detect the warheads before they emerge from subspace ? I believe so . The weapons create minor gravimetric distortions as they approach the subspace barrier , but I 'll need to recalibrate my sensors to isolate the effect . Do it . Even a few seconds warning would help us . Yes , Captain . Your duty shift doesn 't begin for two hours . The Doctor sent me to relieve you early . He wants you to spend more time regenerating . I see he 's enlisted an ally . " Don 't kill the messenger . " It 's Sophocles- - Oedipus Rex . I 've been studying Earth literature as a part of my Academy training . Continue these scans of the subspace barrier . Look for any gravimetric distortions . Run another diagnostic on the injector ports . Make sure they 're aligned . They 're aligned . I checked . Check again . Come to join the fun ? We 're trying to cold-start the warp core ... for the 15th time . Perhaps this will enhance your day . It 's a belated gift for your baby shower . I apologize for my absence . Oh . Proceed . They 're lined with biothermal insulation . Your infant 's feet will be protected , even if the external temperature drops below minus 40 degrees Celsius . Well , they 're certainly unique . Thank you . You 're welcome . I wish to ask you a personal question . Shoot . You have an appealing coiffure . What is your grooming regimen ? You 're asking me what I do with my hair ? Yes . Oh , well , nothing too elaborate . Sonic shower ... a little engine grease . Thinking about a new look ? Perhaps . I 'll keep you apprised if you 'd like . Please do . Was that Seven of Nine ? There must be an alien intruder on board . Computer , make the following modifications to holodeck file : Seven of Nine Alpha-3 , Personal Quarters . Modifications complete . Begin program . You look perfect . Give me a hand with this ? I 'm surprised your Starfleet training didn 't include cork extraction . I must have been sick that day . Looks like wine 's off the menu . Unless you brought a phaser . Never on the first date . Assist me . Slice these vegetables transversally in five-millimeter increments . Aye , aye . That smells delicious . Our appetizer is braised leeks . Primary course : rack of lamb with wild rice . No dessert ? Dessert will be a surprise . I can 't wait . Does this contain enough sodium chloride for your taste ? Could use another .6 milligrams , but you 're the chef . I concur . More salt . Liszt ? Chopin . I 've discovered that classical music has intriguing mathematical properties . Do you play an instrument ? The Doctor 's been giving me piano lessons . I 'd love to hear you play . I require more practice . Your technique is flawed . Sorry. I 'm a replicator man . Use your left hand to guide the food . Observe closely . Pay attention to the vegetable . You 're beautiful when you 're chopping . I don 't mean to sound like an old holonovel , but you 've got a wonderful smile . It wasn 't a smile ; it was a smirk . Oh , no , it was a smile . I could check the internal sensors if you 'd like . Remain still . You have an intriguing facial structure . I 'll take that as a compliment . I require more practice . You 're doing just fine . What 's wrong ? Nothing . I wasn 't aware you had a personal life . Chakotay to Seven of Nine . Chakotay to Seven . Respond . Go ahead . Report to Astrometrics . We 've found something . Yes , Commander . Good morning . Good morning . You found something . At first we thought it was another one of the probes , then lcheb picked up an automated transmission . It 's a warning beacon . You have entered Subspace Munitions Range 434 . Evacuate immediately . Apparently , this entire region is an alien testing ground . We 've been sending out emergency hails , but so far , no response . Whoever 's conducting these tests could be dozens of light-years away . Any progress detecting their warheads ? Not yet . You seem a little distracted . I 'm fine . It 's not like you to be late for a duty shift . Rough night ? Not at all . I 'll be on the Bridge if you find anything . " Better late than never . " Titus Livius , A History of Rome . You 're relieved . Get some rest . Bravo . You approve ? Approve ? I 'm amazed . I was expecting " Chopsticks . " I had no idea you were so good . The Doctor 's an efficient instructor . It won 't be long before you 're giving a recital for the entire crew . The Doctor did suggest that I accompany him during his next operatic performance . Your turn . Mmm ... unfortunately , I don 't play . But I 'd love to hear you again . And this ... is one of my favorites . You want me to stop ? No. I want you to play . I don 't understand . Look . Your technique is flawless , but try to put a little more heart into the piece . More of yourself . That 's all right . Keep going . Tell me what you 're feeling . My tempo is erratic . Not what you 're thinking . What you 're feeling . Your emotions . Frustration , anxiety . Stop thinking about the notes . Just play . I can 't . Yes , you can . Don 't you see what 's happening ? The metronome is holding you back . It gives you a sense of order , but it also cuts you off from your feelings . Remember when you first came aboard ? The thought of disconnecting from the hive mind terrified you . This is no different . It doesn 't have to be perfect . 800,000 kilometers off the starboard bow . Bridge to Seven of Nine . Go ahead , Commander . We need those sensor calibrations . I 'll need a moment to return to my station . That would be a good idea . Hull fracture , Deck 12 . Seven of Nine , report . Stand by , Captain . Lieutenant Paris , isolate subspace band omicron theta . Acknowledged . Direct your sensors to coordinates 178 mark 26 . Nothing there . Correction : 178 mark 36 . I can see them . Two warheads are about to emerge . Adjusting course . Full power to the forward shields . lmpact in five ... four ... three ... two ... Shields are holding . Why wasn 't Seven at her post ? Good question . Maybe you should ask her . It was your responsibility to locate those warheads . I succeeded . Not before we took heavy damage . You told Chakotay you 'd have those sensor calibrations hours ago . The work took longer than I anticipated . It might 've gone faster if you 'd stayed at your post , as you were ordered to do . I didn 't realize I was confined to the Astrometrics Lab . You were on duty . This isn 't the first time you 've left your station over the past few days . Holodeck 2 ? You 've logged a lot of time in there . Mind if I ask why ? Well , it must be something important , Seven . 49 hours in six days ? I was running a simulation . Of what ? A new gravimetric array I 've been developing . I wanted to perfect the design before I brought it to you . I appreciate your efforts to improve our systems , but I can 't have you dividing your time right now . When the ship 's on alert , I expect you to perform your duties . If you need to leave your post , inform Commander Chakotay . Understood ? Yes , Captain . I apologize for my lapse in judgment . We all make mistakes , Seven . I 've even been known to make a few myself . It sounds intriguing . Your new gravimetric array . When this crisis is over , I 'd be happy to take a look . Maybe I can lend a hand . I 've analyzed the sensor data from that last barrage . I 've refined your detection method . We 'll be able to see the weapons 10.3 seconds earlier . The Captain will be pleased . Have I offended you ? No . You 've done nothing wrong . I was negligent in my duties . As a result , Voyager was nearly destroyed . I was hoping you could provide a quotation to help alleviate my guilt . l-l can 't think of one , but I 'd be happy to search the database . That won 't be necessary . Stay here until I return . Where are you going ? To correct an error . Computer , activate Chakotay simulation . Come in . I hope you 're not allergic . Antarian moon blossoms . Extremely rare . I had to smuggle them out of Airponics . Don 't tell Neelix . I thought I 'd cook for you tonight . How does roasted chicken sound ? I slaved over the replicator for hours . Not hungry ? I called you here to thank you . For what ? The past few days have been memorable . To say the least . You 're ending this . In a manner of speaking , yes . Why ? Our relationship is interfering with my responsibilities on Voyager . I could speak to the Captain , have her cut back on your duty shifts . Seven , the past few days have been more than memorable . They 've been an important step forward for both of us . Don 't throw that away . I 'm sorry , Commander . You 're making a mistake . No , I 'm trying to correct one . Ask yourself why you want to end this . is it out of a sense of duty ... or something else ? Every time you move closer to your emotions , you back away . Like hiding behind that metronome . Your analogy is flawed . is it ? I think you 're afraid that embracing your humanity will make you weak , less than perfect . But think about what you stand to gain . It 's irrelevant . No , it 's not . Real intimacy with another person- - nothing 's more relevant . I must return to my station . Stay here with me . This ship needs me . So do I . I can 't function this way ! You 're not a drone anymore , you 're human ! Stop ! Seven ! What 's wrong ? Sick Bay ... medical emergency . Seven ? Computer , locate Seven of Nine . Seven of Nine is in Holodeck 2 . What happened ? We were having an argument , and she just collapsed . Her cortical node is shutting down . She 's going into neural shock . And what happened to her facial implants ? I thought you removed all her cybernetic systems . Computer , end program . Commander ? If you 're looking for your other holographic friend , he 's off-line at the moment . Your cortical node began to shut down . Fortunately , I managed to stabilize it before there was any permanent damage . It was functioning properly when you examined me two days ago . I 'm going to run a diagnostic on your entire cortical array . But it might help if I knew what you were doing , before you collapsed . Did you suffer a physical injury of some kind ? No . Were you exposed to any unusual radiation ? No . What exactly were you doing in there ? Research . That simulation of Commander Chakotay mentioned that the two of you were having an argument . Was that part of your research ? I couldn 't help but notice that you 'd created some quarters for yourself . A new dress ... dinner for two . I trust you 'll respect doctor-patient confidentiality . Of course . I 've been conducting simulations to explore different aspects of my humanity . Such as ? Social activities , friendships with the crew ... intimate relations . I take it our First Officer is your " romantic interest " ? Commander Chakotay seemed like an appropriate choice . He has many admirable qualities . So he does . What prompted all this ? Unimatrix Zero . I 've been trying to re-create some of the experiences I had there . Ever since it was destroyed , my life has ... seemed incomplete . I wanted to feel those emotions again . Well ... this is encouraging . You might be ready to start forming deeper relationships . I 'm proud of you , Seven . Your pride is misplaced . I intend to delete the programs . Why ? I can no longer perform my duties efficiently . My personal life has become a distraction . It 's supposed to be a distraction . You simply have to find the right balance between work and recreation . Inform me when you finish the diagnostic . Seven . For what it 's worth , you have excellent taste . Your quarters ... they suited you . Antimatter flow : stable . Injector ports : aligned . That should do it . Torres to the Bridge . Looks like we 've got warp drive back . Well done . Tom . With pleasure . I 'm detecting another subspace warhead . Range ? 12 million kilometers . Closing from astern . Red Alert . Where 's the target probe ? It 's on a totally different trajectory . When we engaged the engines , the warhead must have diverted from its target and locked on to our warp signature . Evasive maneuvers . It 's matching our course . Eight million kilometers . Can you get a weapons lock ? Affirmative . Photon torpedoes . Full spread . Our torpedoes have been neutralized . Five million kilometers . Bridge to Seven of Nine . Here , Captain . Can you get me anything on the warhead 's internal circuitry ? Stand by . I have it . What can you tell me about the detonator ? The weapon is armed with proximity resonance circuitry . What 's the activation frequency ? 4.84 gigahertz . I may be able to disarm it with an antiresonance pulse . Do it . Two million kilometers . lnitiating the pulse . Seven , status ? The warhead 's rotating its activation frequency . It 's still armed . One million kilometers . Can you compensate ? Negative . Captain , I believe I can disarm the warhead . How ? By extracting the detonator with our transporter . At this velocity ? The device is too small . You 'd never get a lock . I can use the submicron imager to focus our targeting scanners . Please , give me transporter control . 800,000 . All right , Seven . It 's up to you . I have a lock . Energizing . The detonator 's protected by tritanium shielding . I can penetrate it , but not at this distance . We 'll have to wait until it 's closer . 500,000 . Status ? Not yet , Captain . Four ... three ... two ... Brace for impact ! Doctor . You 've come to deliver unpleasant news . is it that obvious ? I 've completed my diagnostic . What you experienced was no malfunction . Your cortical node was designed to shut down your higher brain functions when you achieve a certain level of emotional stimulation . Clarify . It appears to be a fail-safe mechanism ... to deactivate drones who start to regain their emotions . Knowing the Borg , it makes perfect sense . Finding one 's heart is the surest road to individuality . But I 'm no longer linked to the hive mind . The technology 's built into your node . It simply remained dormant ... until now . Can you repair me ? Possibly . I 've been thinking about a way to reconfigure the micro-circuitry . I won 't lie to you , Seven . It would entail multiple surgeries , and the recovery might be difficult . But I believe we could eventually succeed . I 'll prepare the Surgical Bay . We can begin tomorrow morning . No . Without the procedure , you won 't be able to continue your simulations . I 've experienced enough humanity for the time being . They were only holographic fantasies , Doctor . An inefficient use of my time . You don 't really believe that . The fail-safe device will ensure that I 'm no longer distracted . That 's the Borg talking ... not you . As your physician ... as your friend , I 'm asking you to let me proceed . I need to regenerate . Seven ... Good night , Doctor . Where 's the fire ? Fire ? You seem to be in a hurry . I have to finish my report on the subspace warheads . The ship 's out of danger , thanks to you . You 've earned a break . Why don 't you join me in the Mess Hall ? Neelix is going to give a cooking lesson : " Talaxian Tenderloin in Ten Minutes . " I 'm no longer interested in cooking . Then come for the company . B 'Elanna 's going to be there . Tuvok even promised to show up . It 'll be fun . I appreciate your offer . Another time , perhaps . You know , you should try socializing with the crew a little more . It might do you some good .

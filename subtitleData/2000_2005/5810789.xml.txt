 And everybody says the same exact thing : " Don 't wory Max , There is someone special out there for you " What do they think , I 'm not trying ? You know Henry ? I don 't think she exists . And the truth is , If I did find her , I don 't think I 'd know to do it anyway . Max , Will you stop beating yourself ? I don 't know how to date . What is " DATING " ? I mean , Look at those two . Even that guy has a girlfriend . I 'm such a shmug . The last thing you need right now is a girlfriend Some chick missing with your head , Going so cool with you . Pretty soon , She starts pulling the same crap all women do . So they think its thier mission to change us , Even though they 'r the ones that screwed up . You know , like they 'r all dressing " Oh , Sexy " to get your attention . but then you follow one of them from apart , And she slaps a restraining order on you . You kidnapped your dog . That 's not the point . The point is ... Before you know it , she 'd been ... nagging you into submission , and keepin you on a leech . .. so you 'r away from your friends . you know what the best part of a blowjob is ? Ten minutes of silence . No man understands women ... It 's like we genetically programmed , to think differently . Never mind.We have bigger problems . Jonas has invited president Chumly , to watch his test for Replicator today . Oh , why he wants to do something stupid like that for ? Genetics conference is live in a week away , We 're on the Replicator work , .. So Jonas Is losing his mind - Hey , Felix . - Oh , Jesus . what caught up your ass ? just look at yourselves , we 're presenting our work to the president of the univercity , and you look like you just got out of your bed . I did just got out of bed . I 'm very tired , see , having spending a hundred hours a week in the lap ... for the last six months to make sure my work is ready What you 've been up to ? - He 's been busy kissing Jonas 's ass . Ha , ha , ha . We 're gonna be late . Why ? Why he , you see , like that ? Ah.Hmm ... Now take a good look , Sir , because you wont believe your eyes , otherwise . It 's true .What Dr. Fromer done here , is absolutely amazing . - Felix ? - Mm-hm ? If you feel comfortable removing your nose , face and head , from Jonas 's ass , Henry can use some help with that . At least one of us gives Dr.Fromer the respecthe deserves . Oh , that what it is ? - don 't make me ... - don 't do ! Oh , that is so abnoxious ! A single drop of her blood ... contains all the genetic information we need . We simply put it into the Replicator , where it will combine with ... a special hormon-growth solution that , I have developed . Okay , Let 's get to it . - Yes . - Okay . This Better work . Now president Chumly , a simple drop of blood ... Or strand of hair , contains all the genetic information we need . then , with the hyper Replicator ... we can circumventing normal stages of development , and instantly create a full grown adult clone . - Here is the original . - and Here is Fluffy . I 'll take this ... president Chumly , meet : Fluffy ... Two . Am hm , Fluffy two . Oh , fantastic work , Jonas . I was getting a little worried , when i fought so hard to get the international genetics conference here , That you gonna let me down . But now , the world will be stunned . ... When we present this . You 'll make Springdale Univercity famous . You do better than that , You will make it super famous . I could not have done that without your support , Sir . If they could have done it . I 'm going to lunch with the Trust-Eve . Why don 't you join me ? I 'll be delighted , Sir . Thank you . I 'll be right there , just give me a minute with my staff . super . I want a full biological review done ... On that rodent . cellular morphology ... growth rate , brain wave function , Sexual viabiltiy Everything . A full biological ... ? Well look , she is fine . As you may recall , we 've done that with the last Fluffy two ... Untill she mysteriously ... imploded . We need to present a perfect clone to the conference next week And if we don 't , Well you can forget about that associate professorship . Been here for years . I practically developed The hyper Replicator , You know that . Jonas said he 'd make me associate-professor , If i stuck fine , " Henry have stuck ? " Oh , I have stuck . - You stuck . If you do this ... I deserve a promotion . And you will get it . But there is no way he can deny you , After this presentation . - if every thing goes all right . Will you even buy attention in there ? We can make enough Hamsters , to feed every starving kid in Thailand . Can 't feed hamsters to children . Henry , any number of things can go wrong . I mean , he is rush to a senator 's conference I don 't have time for a proper biological ... Do not focus on that lap . You need to chill out .. - Go out and find some hot chick to jack your penis into - Oh , that 't brilliant , that 's what i need . - Yes ... - that 's not what I need , what I need is ... You have chosen wisely , my son . No , no , no.No Henry , end badly . always is badly , everyone single time ... God , she is just stunning . - yes ! What could I possibly have in common with that woman ? MOLECULAR CELL BIOLOGY Oh , God . You might just not hang out with your balls raw 'Cause you are not obviously man anymore , She is out my league , Henry . Girls like that date pro-athletes or rock stars What are you talking about , " Rock Star " ? I 'm just being a realistic man . I 'm a lab assistant . This is nothing girls find exciting .Ever . Excuse me .Hi . Didn 't i see you in Dr. Fromer 's lab this afternoon ? - Yes . - Yeah .Yes . I am a huge fan of genetics . Oh , I 'm Sorry .You guys Probably get that all the time . Not as much as you think . Well , I 'm Kate Carson , and I 'm doing a piece on genetics ... for Modern Science of magazine . I Interview ... Dr.Fromer this morning about the Hyper-Replicator . Well , today is your lucky day . Because , Max here knows everything about the Replicator . - I 'm sure he can fill you in . - That would be wonderfull . - and this is a clone ? - No , this is just a beta test . Ther have been a few kinks . Well , she looks healthy to me . You ... How long you 'v been doing this ? Since I was five .Did you watch " Scooby Doo " when you were a little ? - Ofcourse I did . - Okay . Remember the one with the rich , handsome , oil tycoon ... Ask Velma out on a date , and she curiously peggerously declines ? - vaguely . - Same episode , Shaggy gets cloned . And ever since I saw that , I 've been hooked . I had to be the guy that , making cloning a reality . And with this technology , Kate , The possibilities are endless . I mean , we can save endangered species from becoming extinct ... we can grow human organs for transplants , We might be able to cure cancer . I 'm going off .But the point is : I love Genetics .i always have . And I think I can make the world a better place . I know exactly what you mean . I mean , I 've wanted to be a journalist ... Since I was A kid . And I always thought I can get ... Ouch ! He bit me ! - Fluffy ! - Oh , my God is she okay ? she is a little dizzy , but she is fine . How is your finger ? It 's fine . It 's just a little blood . I think i 'm gonna need a bandage . I 've got some in the first workstation , second drawer . - Ok .Are you gonna be okay ? - Oh , I 'll be fine . I , Just had a little problem with blood . But i 'm sorry , I should 've warned you About Fluffy , that Fluffy is sort of adjusting To being alive . Please don 't even wory about that .It 's fine . Are you sure you gonna be okay ? Yeah , I 'll be fine . Oh , God , Is that clock right ? I 'm late . I should 've been on my way to airport ten minutes ago . - Derek 's gonna kill me . - Derek ?

That 's kool baby I 'm not gonna leave without the lead guitarist . Max , thanks for everything . And meeting you was inspiration . - Inspiration ? the guy is a toad . - Derek ! replication CHAMBER Not SECURE Damn . Felix ! replication IN PROGRESS SEQUENCE COMPLETE Oh , whoa .

Look , look , look . you see ? Pick yourself up and just ... Whoa ! Morning , Sir . Well , well , well , I see you finally showing , the kind of dedication i expect . - Well , you 'll be glad to hear , that the Replikator is working perfectly . I 'm just dog tired , So i 'm gonna get some sleep.I 'll See ya . Oh ! No , no ! Oh , oh , oh ... Oh , Dear.Kate ! Kate ! Do not eat the hamster ! Yep , I love college . - What 's up ? - Oh , thank God . thank God that you are here ! - This better be important . It 's 7 : 00 Am , Me wouldn 't even be up yet . it 's important .I had a little accident at the lab last night . Did you break the Replicator ? Did you sell Fluffy this time ? Remember Kate ? The Modern Science goddess from yesterday ? ... I cloned her . Oh , Yeah.Ha , Ha.Very funny , man . Ae h , you ain 't even a reporter ... Or you 'r just some old friendi Rott in to put in this lime gag ? I 'll tell you , when it comes to jokes , you are crap . Henry ! Oh , Shit . I still don 't believe it , a human clone . You made a fully grown ... biologically correct , extremely sexy ... human clone , Max ! Really illegal , Henry ! We 'll go to jail.We 'r so screwd ! What , we screwd ? Fuck that . Henry ! I 'm talking about the clone and I . I can use some help here buddy , please . Hm ... Yeah , sure.You ain 't have to ask . Right . First of all , we must make sure .. that no one finds out . She can 't be a clone , Unless there is an original , and the original is in Europe , Right ? Hatchom ! So all we gonna do is teaching her , to behave like a normal person . Unless , ofcourse she is a total morron . No , she is not a total morron . She just hasn 't that time to simulate yet . Her brain is perfect ! It 's like a sponge . She can learn in a day what could normally take years . She 's a blank slate right now ! So .. we could program her . She is not a VCR , Henry , we 're talking about . We can make a woman , Who likes sports .. and action movies ... and hanging out in the Bars ... and not cats , or Winecollars or fool play . You mean , make a woman , Who acts exactly like a man . Exactly.The perfect woman . A woman , that man can actually understand . What did you do that for ? I don 't know . I mean , yes , we have to assimilate her , but ... Stop it ! I suppose to certain extenize her duties , _ Try to make a better human being . Exactly . Now , she shouldn 't have time problems ... or be obssesed about her weight . And she has to learn how to drive . - Stick ! And football and Sunday does not end ... Untill Monday night . - This is perfect . - Oh , there 's so much stuff . I don 't even know where to begin . My vow is for housebreaking . That 's nasty . Oh , come on ! Here , these are books . We learn things by reading these . Television , however Is much easier to use ... and much more fun . Television . - This is a home arcade system . - very cool . I 've got 49 games that you can play on this , 48 of which , are sports games . Some times , it is fun , to watch one friend 's puke . - puke . - this is toiletpaper . This is hair.never spend more than five minutes styling . - Definitly . - May be ten . this too , toiletpaper . When you really on the pench . - Jonas is an ... - asshole . - When we see Felix , we ... - ... kick him . These are nipples . - nipples . - Now show me yours .

Um , you know , emotinal attachement . Less talking , More sex . Valid argument . There 's still though , I mean numerous ethical Dominants , Inheriting the act , Including ... Lower . No , no , not.You ... technically , you 're Ten years old . You don 't wanna have sex with me ? No , I don 't . yes , I do . Max , I think you accidentally locked the door ! It 's definitly locked !

You know what you gona need this morning ? Oh , what 's that ? Me . No , no . No , I have to go to work . - Oh , can I go ? - no no no . I need you to stay here , and hold down the fort , Like a trooper And there are rules , for when I 'm gone.Okay ? Rule number one : Brush your teeth . Several times . Rule number two - And this is an important one : No leaving the house , When I 'm not here . If anything happens , I need you to call me at this ... Special emergency number . Says Lab . Kate ? Kate , did you hear me ? Yeah , whatever . When will you be home ? I don 't know exactly . I have a lot of work to do today . But , there is plenty of things here you can entertain yourself with . you got a globe , There is some dice over there . Ae h , there is a book . You should try reading a book . Or a magazine ! And then there is Albums and CDs and , ae h ... Ofcourse , there is always the television as well ! Max ! We got a problem ! - i was drunk , I was weak . _ lch intend not before , with it to sleep . ' n was error . - You know I didn 't mean to sleep with her.big mistake . - Yeah ? well , It is just got bigger . - Couldn 't possibly get any bigger - We meet again ! Aah ! Say : I told you he 'd be excited , to see you . - what , you ? What happened .. you were flying.You were jetting ... No.Modern Science thought there may be a bigger story here So , Jonas agreed to let me spend a week in the lab , He 's even renting me his guest room . I 'm going to be here untill your presentation . Isn 't that exciting ? More than you could possibly imagine . What about your boyfriend ? Isn 't he upset ? He is not my boyfriend anymore . We broke up . But he seemed like such a nice guy , very , very talented . May be you should ... go back and give him a second chance , and patch things up . I don 't think that 's gonna happen . After talking to you the other day , I realised how truely important my work is to me . And Derek just never got that . It was time to break it off . Is something wrong ? - No , I just , ah , I didn 't think I was gonna see you again ... For the rest of my life . - I just hope you guys don 't get sick of me , Because I 'm gonna be around you guys 24 hours a day . Ooh , look who finally decided ... to join us this morning .. I need you to look at Fluffy two . Something is wrong with her . With Fluffy ? What 's wrong ? This is all she does . Well , I suppose if we look on putting all the hamster production on one flew off the Cocko 's nest , We 've been in pretty good shape , will we ? We have a genetics Conference in three days , and we don 't have yet a perfect clone ! So , nobody leaves this lab untill this problem is fixed . Ah , Sir , I have very important business to take care of tonight . Well , It 's a shame , And though I thought you 'd be quite dedicated to this job . Hey , Max , if Fluffy is going all funny , You think this has anything to do with ... ? No , She has a human brains , The most advanced learning device that ever known to man . She is probably in home , memorizing the encyclopedia . Yes ! Go , go ... So much for the Replicator , Huh ? Ah ! Aua ! - My hormon-growth solution reminds ... gives me extra kick , if you will , to the growth medium only the Kick if you want so . And thus , with the hyper + stimulated cell division You can bypass the stages of normal cell growth ... to create an adult clone . Impressive . But how do you deal with the keytone shift ... Of the Mitochondrian variation during rapid Zellmitoses ? Well , I would mind abored you with ... the technical jugg on , Miss Carson , because it 's very , very complicated stuff . Oh , my Godness ! Ah , I wonder , What is going on over there over there , in the hamster research station . Well , ti looks like fluffy two stopped running into the wall . Yes , because she is not in her self conscious , Sir , Ah , Even after i put a helmet on her . i think I figured out what 's wrong . The cloning process messes up the brain . Fluffy two pain receptors actually formed as pleasure receptors . Which explains , why she keeps pumbing her head Into the wall . She finds the experience joyfull . Felix , only you could come up with the scientific theory ... Involving the phrase : Messes up the brain . Now please , one of you has actually learned something today ? Wait a second . That 's it , Sir . learning . there is nothing wrong with Fluffy two 's brain . She just hadn 't had the experience yet . She will learn how to behave ... from other members of her species . We isolated this clone . I think , we should put her with other hamsters . Are you saying , a clone made from this process , Has the capacity to learn ? Yes , Sir , It 's exactly what I 'm saying . Jaah ... Heja ! ouch ... Max , you think i can get that interview ? now ? No , but Felix will be more than happy to sit down with you . We 'll speak tomorrow . So , Eh ... You seem like a really nice person . Oh , Hi.I found this in your bed . And I need some of these Tit-restraining devices . Wait a sec . Hi.I 'm Brandy . How are you guys today ? - I 'm working on it , Brandy . How are you ? - Oh , I 'm fine , thank you . Is there anything I can help you with ? yeah . We need a shit lot o ' bras . - Oh . Okay . What size are you ? Oh.I don 't know . What 's this look like ? Whoa ! Sorry . She is from , ah , Hollywood . Oh . Ah , you look , like a size 36 C. Amm , I 'll go check basic support , and why don 't you feel free to look around ? Thanks , Brandy . Okay , you can 't show your boobs to everybody . There are rules . we 'll talk about them . Okay , this is , a ... ah , this is a Thong . girls like them . I don 't really understand why . - Hey . - Hey.Okay , this ... Try this on.If it fits , we can get out of here . Oh , so we already know each other a day , and you already buying me a Lingerie ? Do you always move this fast ? Yes , always.very ... No , no , i don 't . I just enjoy shopping , for Lingerie . i haven 't an act for it . - Oh.Yes , You do . Listen , I interviewed Felix . But I understand that you are the one I need to talk to . So , if you some time right now ... I would love to get this interview ... - Now is not so great . - How do you know my size ? - I 'm just a lucky guess.I 'm a lucky guy . What you say we try it on ? Not together , Ofcourse . Carefull , there is a broken glass in here . Okay , I know this is a shit lot of bra , but here . Brandy , These are all dreadfull.All of them . We need more.Could you get more ? - Okay . Shopping is over . Let 's go . - No , wait , I need some bras , and I don 't wanna come here yet , everything tastes that . - Fine.How is this ? - Okay , We 'll test try ... No , Not here.You do that in the changing room , Okay ? - Okay . - go to ... Oh , no . Oh , What are you doing back ? you 're not supposed to be in here ? Ah um , I know . Yes , but I found something else that I think you might like . Oh , really ? What ? - Ma 'am , I think you gonna ... - This , I found this for you . Wait a minute , this is much racier than the one I asked you for . Well , There is nothing wrong with being a little racy . - GO ! - I 'll go . - we are leaving . - How is it look ? What hell happened ? It looks great.Let 's go . Why are you still here ? I told you you have to leave . Yes , i heard you , but I 'm waiting for you . Now go to where you are from , you 're outta here , buddy ! - Yeah , I heard you . - Listen to me , we gotta go . - I 'm coming ! Max ! Sorry I rush you , you just look so good . That I can 't wait to get you home . - We have a theorem , that if you 're in a hurry , Why don 't we do it in the dressing room ? Hm ? Ha ! - Can you help this nice woman ? - Ah , you , you can 't go in ... But I ... But I ... Hi , I 'm Brandy . Can I help you ? Damn , I look good . We have to go away . Come on , come on ! - I 'm not dressed . - Please ! Whoa . What 's The capital of America ? - what 's America ? - Okay . Ah , thank you . Ah , Sir ... Sir ! Sir ! Hey , Hollywood !

Fine.Just fine , thanks . Good . Hey . Hi . You 're ready to get busy ? Sure . Join you right here ? Here in the lab ? But Felix 's watching ? Yes , why not ? You are not shy though , Are you ? Well , yeah.A little bit . I mean , Since you and I have never done this together before . just a little break , And we 're done.Right ? Hey , where is Max ? He said he was gonna join us . - You asked Max to join us ? Yeah , It was all his idea . Then there must be some .. Max wouldn 't ... What 's that for ? - To take the blood samples . No , no , that 's not necessary . cause I was gonna wear a condom . Why don 't you just grap the hamsters , and we 'll get started ? You wanna have these hamsters ? ! I don 't know anyway to do without them . But , the thing is ... - Henry , I need to talk to you ! - Max , thank God you 're here . Felix ! Would you give me a hand here ? Ah ! ... Aah ! Whoa . The original was the clone . And which you thought was the clone , was the original . The clone came to work when we were away , but then the original came back , And I 've got to get the clone home now before the original sees her ! - What was the first bit again ? - that , ah um , the clone ... You were speaking to the clone . - who is that ? - that is the original ! - But she wanted to ... - Just keep an eye on things ! - Okay . Okay . Max , there is something wrong with Fluffy two . She sounds sick . - Sick ? - What 's wrong with Fluffy two ? - What 's up ? - I don 't know . Well she seems like a little indigesting may be . did you take samples ? - No , not yet . - get me a hypo , Henry . - But that 's blood , you ... - there is no time.Get the needle . - Okay . Max , are you sure ? I mean , What if there 's something wrong with the cloning process ? There is nothing wrong with the process . Hello , everybody . Hi . How is our project coming on ? - Fine , Sir . This is a perfectly , healthy clone . That is fuckin ' awesome . - What did you do ? ! - Aaah ! I just stuck in the needle , stuck in the needle . I knew she was sick ! So what does that mean ? every clone we make is gonna explode . Oh , no.Oh , no ! Aah ! Aah ! Sir , please , sir. please ! Oh , God , you do not look so good . I feel so good . I feel like I 'm gonna burst . Oh , jesus.You are ! Take cover ! We all might die . Everyone take cover ! We need a doctor immediately ! Sir , there is others in front of you . Mary Langner , This is a matter of life and death . That woman can explode any minute ... When she does , the whole building comes down with her . I need every doctor you 've got . And possibly the bomb squad . What 's wrong ? Am I gonna be okay ? I think that 's the last ever . I think there 's a little bit intestinals up here . . Actually , I believe that 's a spleen . I don 't care what it is , Just , clean it up . Get it off the ceiling.If you don 't mind . Where is max ? Ah , He had an emergency to tale care of . Oh , he had an emergency to tale care of , I see . That makes all sense to me . Do me a small favor . If anybody hears from Max , Would you give him a message from me ? . Would you tell him , to get his ass back here ! Now ! - Okay . Hydrogen Sulfat , Danger Explosive ... She 's had a little bit too much soda , but otherwise she 's fine . - So that 's it ? I mean , that she 's not going to explode ? Ah , no , no . In fact , she is healthiest person .. I 've ever seen in my life . - really ? Not enough of cholesterol , perfect x-rays , every blood cell .. seems to be brand new , ... Max , watch , if I leave this thing longer , my whole arm turns purple . Look ! No , she 's not the brightest bomber , is she ? Hey , You know what 's on tonight ? Wrestling ! Let 's order Pizza ! I don 't want Pizza , okay ? I think I 'm going on a diet . We 're starting a bite job . Just once , I would love to sit down and , I don 't know ... talk ! Hello , can you ... Can you talk to me ? Can we do that ? I do not think so , okay ? - that 's not funny , Kate . - I smell that cooking ! We never talk . I 'm not just some thrusting , verile ... Okay , okay . Quite , Quite . Come on . We can talk , okay ? We can have a nice happy conversation about ... - Ouch , that 's a little rough ! - ... Wrestling ! Body Slam ! I 've got you now ! This is Henry.Listen. Your job is on the line . Jonas is pissed that you didn 't finally started going You better call me . Dammit , Kate , Would you get off me ? Max , It 's Kate . You know someone else named Kate ? - Ah , I ... - who is she ? ! Ouch ! No one important , okay ? ! - who is she ? ! - She is the reporter , I went to lunch with . She is covering my work . - Do you wanna screw up ? - we are just friends.Okay We didn 't have a lot in common . I just enjoy being with her . So , that 's a total waste of time . Okay , tabby , comes . Enough for a threat . Time for some sex ! Not tonight , I have headache . Auu ! Max , How did it go last night ? Any more problems with Repli-Kate ? Problems ? All I have is problems . Wet still have to move the Replicator to the auditorium for the Presentation , We 've no idea what happened to poor Fluffy two , And I have an insane clone , literally , destroying my appartment . She 's developed into a reality problem , Henry . What you mean ? Waht I mean , I think we made a mistake . We should 've exposed her to a few feminine influences . Like what ? Dishing ? I 'm seriuos . I 'm hanging out with Repli-Kate , and she is acting just like a guy . But it is not as good as we thought it was going to be . I 'm begining to wonder , what women even seen us ... Dude , Wat 's your problem ? She is a woman , Who acts like a man , It 's what every man wants . No , It 's what every man says he wants , May be all the things we don 't understand about women ... All this little korks they drive us crazy , may be this is more important than we realize . Repli-Kate listens , but she doesn 't hear me . She 's completly self-involved . I don 't know , she just hasn 't date ... I feel like I 'm dating ... me ... I 'll never get that lucky . What do you think what happens if the real Kate found out ? Don 't even say that . Don 't you think she has the right to know ? Oh , you idiot . Two identical women , and you fall for the one that blew you in a bar . Carefull with that . That is expensive . do you understand me ? You get it , expensive , cost a lot money . - Is Kate here ? - Yeah , over there . That 's not gonna fit through those door , Felix . Hey , what happened to you yesterday ? I 've tried to reach you . I 'm so sorry I didn 't call you back . I 've been , I had to rush a friend of mine into the university infirmary . I hope I 'm not interrupting , but I ... just heard something very funny , and I thought I 'd share it with you , my friends . Evidentally , it was discovered that the reason Fluffy two exploded ... was because someone in here fed her Hydrogen Sulfat . Now , here is the funny part ... It was discovered by miss Carson , Who was not a geneticist by profession . And yet seems to know more about what 's going on this lab ... Than you two , pathetic excuses scientists . I have a presentation in 24 hours , and just yesterday ... we have disquit the guest honour off the walls with a shammy.Now ! This Replicator has to be moved , a new clone made ... and a new set of data derived . If this is not done , if this presentation is in anyway compromised , then you will not only be out of the job tomorrow , But I will see to it you will never work in this field again . Do you dig it ? ! Sir , if you thinking , by threatening me , you can force me .. to be your slave , well ... You can 't shit . Max , I have ... Oh , miss Carson , I don 't think Max needs any more distractions from you . Now , why don 't we discuss the nights lnterview with my home . Dude , you 'll be here all night . Repli-Kate 's gonna freak . No , she won 't , cause you gonna be keeping an eye on her . - what ? - Just , give her two Sixpacks .. of Burger and several hours of cartoons . Okay . Hi.Uh ... - Hi , Mary ... Langner . - hello . I 'm from the biomedical labs here on Campus . I understand you treated a friend of mine , yesterday . She came came with someone named Max Flemming . Oh , a tall girl , good looking , no insurance ? That 's her . Yes . Hey . Amm , the eighth grade ... was fascinatingfor a number of variations . yeah , this is so amazing . And you 've given me such wonderfull information ... It 's almost overwhelming . I should probably get some rest before the big day tomorrow . Oh , yes , I do have a speech to prepare myself . Yes , you do.And I 'm gonna let you to that ... So , thank you so much . Well , good night . Wanna a beer ? - I 'm not in the mood . - What 's up ? It 's Max . First , I thought we was cool and all . But he 's just gone wierd on me . He doesn 't wanna play video games , He doesn 't wanna watch sports , He 's on a diet ! Yeah , I didn 't know he was starting to ounch up a bit . Yeah , And he 's not putting out , so ... What ? You mean you two on ... We did it once , and that was two days ago . See , all I want is just have a lot of casual Sex without getting bugged in a relationship . But it 's just he had these issues with it . What 's up with that ? I don 't know . I mean , I 've always said : You wanna shag someone , shag him . What brings emotions to it , eh ? Dude , Exactly . It is not natural , to have sex with the same person.And I 'm young . If somebody wants to have sex with me , I think , I should have sex with them . Yeah , specially when Max is so into ... What did you say ? Oh , nothing . This is bullshit . So he can have sex with somebody else , and I can 't . Are you thinking what I 'm thinking ? What are you thinking ? I 'm sorry to bother you so late , Sir , but I have something may be you really need to see . Have you seen this ? That woman Has given Max full credit ... for the Replicator ! Okay , but I ... After all I 've done for that kid , And this is how he rebays me ? ! If this goes to print , I 'm finished ! I 'm not so sure about that . You gonna take a look at this . Why the long face ? I just wanted to hel people , Kate That 's all I 've wanted to do . And now it seems like ... every single thing I touch , turns to complete shi ... I can 't stop screwing up . Max , listen.Every great inventor screwed up It took Edison over thousand attempts , to create ... the light bulb .If you don 't make mistakes , you 'll never learn . How much of the Repilcator was your idea ? That 's hard to specify , I mean , Jonas fill all the paper , and Felix does a pretty job bringing Bagels in the morning ... - public figure . - 90 percent . Max , listen to me , you are going to help people . You know , may be one day , you might even take credit for your own work . - This can 't be . - It is , ... That 's the charts for the woman Max took to the hospital , Here 's the charts for Fluffy two . - find this woman , tonight ! - I 'll do my best , Sir . ... Mention " Left me " ... And for years , I 've dreamed we could get back together . And may be get married . But It never did , because of the fucken dog . Enough with the murder mouth . Are you ready to go again yet ? Again ? It 's been five years , you know ? There is a limit to how long a man can go ! - oh , really ? - Yeah . - I 'm outta here . - what ? Besides , We 're out of beer . All I need is ten minutes ... And I 'll be fine ! Kate ! Oh , my Godness . She 's perfect . She sure is . So , the woman that called you in the lab the other day , Was she an Ex-girlfriend ? Ah , sort of . What was she like ? She was surprisingly like you ... In a lot of ways , Too much like me in all the others . - To tell you the truth , she is ... - So you 're not seeing anyone ? No . Excuse me ! Excuse me ! Have anyone seen a girl just gone , That wants to have sex all the time ? Yeah , she 's in the back .. With the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus . She better be not shagging them . Kate ? Kate ! I 'm just com here to surprise you . Well , you did . Who the hell are you ? Oh , are you still mad of me ? You , you look amazing . Did you do change your hair ? No , it just got messed while I was banging Henry . Ah , you slept with another guy already ? It didn 't take very long , Kate . No , shit.It lasted two minutes stops . What you 're doing is did it back to me ... Because you pissed that I screwed on you ? - No . I 'm doing this to get Max for sleeping around on me . Ma ... Max ? You slept with two guys ? Yeah , and I 'm looking for more . Okay , all right , baby , You made your point . I cheated on you , I was on tour , and I was wrong , And I 'm sorry . Okay ? But they were groupies , baby . It 's not a thing with real women . I don 't care who you sleep with , What , you don 't care , If I 'm having sex with other women , while I 'm having sex with you ? Wait , you mean like threesome ? No ! I will be totally into that . I .. I get off a ten . I know where to go . - That 's what I feel . - Me too , me too . Thank you , Kate . Thank you for tonight . And for everything you said . I really needed that . Do you know the real reason I broke up with Derek ? Amm , because ... he was holding you back from doing what you really wanted to do No ? - No . Because he was in a million years , he 'd never do anything as sweet as this . Hey , beautifull . Do you really move when I ask you to join a threesome ? Ah umm.Yeah. You know , I got my ride waiting out , He 's dumb , but he is hot . Could we make that a foursome ? Oh , absolutely . The more , the merrier . Let 's go . Excuse me please.Kate , wait ! Kate ! - No , wait . - what ? We shouldn 't do this . If Jonas finds ... No.He won 't . He is in his office , practicing his speech . Besides , I don 't want you to go . Come . You go ahead , make yourself comfortable And while I 'm refreshing up . He can 't get angry at me for not finding her , This is a big town , I 'm just one guy . She 's not gonna just fall on my lap . So , you 're staying there ? The stay address your author gave me ? Yeah , that will do . What is going on ? We are allowed to be here , right ? Oh , who gives a shit ? Go find a bedroom . Go , bedroom . Hi . Let 's get this show on the road , girls . He finally came to accept this . Oh.Kate.Wow. Mamma.Listen , Kate , ah umm ...

Thank you . This is redicilous . Oh ... Wow.You are aside as I 'm . Nice trick . Oh , my God . - Max ! - Now , Felix ! Take that , bitch ! Could you be any more incompetent ? Give me a hand . Oh , my God ! - Oh yeah , my better . - Oh , yes ! Oh , God , I think I 'm gonna explode ! - Henry , is that you ? - who the hell is Henry ? Whoa , whoa , is there somebody else in here ? Yes ! Oh , my God ! - Oh , my God ! - Oh , my God , it 's Derek Waters from Green Snake ! - Hey , what 's up ? - Where the hell is Kate ? ! I was with Kate ! She was with me . You and Kate ? I was with Kate ! Who the hell are you ? Whoa , whoa ! If you all there , Who is licking my balls ? Uuuh ! Uuh ! Kate ! Kate , where are you ? Kate ! Shit ! Oh , Shit . - No , shit . - You cannot do this to us , Jonas . I 'm not responsible for your situation , Max is.He cloned you . I 'm simply looking out for your best interrests . - By kidnapping us ? You always wanted to be in science , oh , now you are science . You feel it lucky.Punk ? ! Kate ! This is absolutely incredible . She is a perfect clone . Sir , these women seemed kinda scared . You sure this is the best way to handle .. ? Don 't be so thick headed . The potential of this research , was always to clone a human being . And now , that Max drop us one ... on our laps , You won 't let her go . Those are no longer women in there , They 're founds for information that must be mined for science . Now , I 've gotta go rehears my speech . You stay here . Nobody goes in or out of that lab except me , understand ? ! Yeah . Put a line ! May be next prepare your hands ... You stay away from me . - What 's up ? - Jonas has the Kates . And he has revised his presentation , in order to frame us . Oh , that dick ! The moment those two girls walk across the stage tomorrow , They 'll become lab-rats for the rest of their lives . Yeah , we gotta call the cops . Where is the phone ? And say what , Henry ? That somebody stole our clone . We don 't even know where they are . We know precisely that ... they 'll be tomorrow at 9 : 00 am.Presentation. - Right.So what do we do ? We use this . Pubes ? That ... Oh , yeah . Max , that bastard . How could he do this to me ? To us ? I don 't know . Besides he 's nagging and wagging ... He was kinda cool to me . I 'm fine with him . That doesn 't make what he did any less wrong . He created you , so to a relationship with . And why was he so interested in being with you ? Get out of here ! What ? I 'm sorry ? Get out of here ! Now ! - But I thought ... Get out , Get out ! Get out , Get out ! Good clone , Jonas . Such a good clone . I think that went pretty well ... It was hell of training him a five whole words . - Penis . - Ah , six words . - You shouldn 't have taught him that . Son of a ... Don 't worry , we 'll get you out of here ! Right now ! Stay there , stay . Tou have a lot of explaining to do . I cloned you by accident . I know it 's not an excuse , but it is the truth . Yeah , I did terrible thing , but I 'm not like Jonas . I 'm still the guy was last night , The guy , who is completely in love with you . And will do anything for you . Could you be any sappier ? The girls actually falls for this shit ? I screwed up . Kate , I cloned you by accident . I know it 's not an excuse ... I heard you.But I see still have a thing for cloning people . I don 't know , I didn 't know any way else to do . As soon as Jonas tell the world that you 're a clone and she 's a clone ... - just get me out of here . - All right.Sorry. You gonna be a research project for the rest of your live . Yeah , I know you hate me right now ... I 'm not even blaming you . But if we get out of here , we 've got to work together . Okay , what do we do ? We just had to get you out of here before Jonas makes his speech . Where is Repli-Jonas ? ! - Oh , punk . Find Repli-Jonas , stall him ! Do not let him get to the stage ! Oh , here he is.Excuse me . Where are you ? I 've got a room full of people , waiting to see you . Whenever the front .. When ever ... the frontiers of genetics are explored ... Felix ! Felix ! If memory serves me correct , I thought I had asked you to stay back at the lab and guard the Kates . And so , a question comes to mind . And you know what that question is ? - Ah umm , no . - Why are you here ? - Oh , Sir , I wouldn 't have guessed ... - Zip it ! Now why don 't you go back to the lab and stay there , untill I tell you to leave . You can do that for me , can 't you ? Can you do that for me ? You can do it , right ? Do it ! Okay , guys , guys , come . She sells , Sea shells , She sells , Sea shells ... This is Giovanni Bellini , president of largest ... Genetics research company in Rome , Gene-ltalia . I 'm a big fan of your work I 'm very excited to see this today . - Get out of here ! - No , seriuosly . I 'm excited . And , ah , this is max , Dr. Fromer 's chief research assistant . Oh , you must be great , working with a genius like Dr. Fromer . Oh.I 'm here because of Dr. Fromer . He made me what I 'm today . I 'm here because of Dr. Fromer . He made me what I 'm today . I have a very important question to ask the doctor . If you can excuse us . Such fun of the staff.Parbequeue First he tells me to watch the Kates , then he tell me not to watch the Kates , Then he says to watch them again . And I 'm gonna get some trouble They 're out ! Get up ! Go ! Go that way . - You guys go that way . - Okay . Hey , Katie Katie Katie . Where you are , Kate ? It 's just me , Felix . Hey , hey , go that way . Who 's your mamma now ? It 's okay . Nothing to be afraid of , Kate . Come on out . - Yah ! - Uh ! Kate ? Oh , Jonas.Guess what ? Your clones escaped . I won 't be so sure about that ! Get her ! How is there in Beirut ? Whenever the fronteers men of genetics ... go exploring , They can encounter a questionable morality . Why are you doing this ? You know you don 't have to . I 'm squirrel with a nut , trying not to knock you , Kate . Holy shit ! Another clone ! Jonas ! Have it ! Another clone ! Oh ! And Felix is down to the ten.Yeeeah ! Go , We get Jonas.Repli-Jonas ! With this hamster , I will demonstrate to you ... The hyper-Replicator ! And your world , Ladies and Gentlemen , will never ... Your world will never be the same ... Jonas ! Would you excuse me for one moment ? - Max . - Ah ! Oh ! Psst . Here ! - Penis ! Penis , Penis . Penis . Penis . Waht is going on ? ! We have a Kate , Sir . Well , find the other one ! Fast ! I 'm in the middle of my presentation ! Okay , I 'll go right on her , Sir . Anything else ? Hey , here.Look. Cookies ! Come here now . Excuse me , Ladies and Gentlemen . As I was saying ... Guys , a little problem : Chumly is coming . Oh.That way , Quick . Go . Go now . - Yeah ! - Cookies ! - Yeah , get down . What ... Couldn 't wear a dress ? Waht the hell is wrong with Jonas ? He 's not really himself today , Sir . Why he keeps saying " Penis " ? No , he 's saying , ah , " Genius " . No , it was " Penis " . Ah , we don 't know . And now , we take this blood here , and we combine it with some genetic , ah um , hormone stuff , put it right in the Replicator ... MALFUNCTION . And now , Ladies and Gentlemen ... ABNORMAL DNA PAIRS . REPLICATION ERRORS ! ... prepare yourself ... for the unbelievable , A fully grown , adult clone ! Is that bad ? Is that bad ? There seems to be a small technical problem , Ladies and Gentlemen , but ... I can assure you that this machine does indeed work . Because my assistant Max even cloned ... a human being ... in this machine . And there it is ! Oh , no ! And there is the original ! One of them , I don 't know which , Vice Versa Oh , come on.He 's lying We 're twins ! That 's right . If max hadn 't resqued us , Jonas would 've turned us into the world 's biggest frogs . Don 't trust them , Ladies and Gentelmen Because these clones are crafty . Would you just give me a couple of minutes ? I could explain everything I can prove they 're lying .. By getting blood samples from them We don 't need to get blood samples . It 's not necessary ! Get out of my way . I can assure you that ... There is not a single human clone in this university . hello . Ah ! He did it again ! He cloned me this time ! - He cloned me this time . Max , I wanna know what 's going on right here , and I wanna know it now ! Who made this clone ? I did . No , he didn 't . I did . No , she didn 't . I did No , they didn 't , Sir . Someone else did . I 'm here because of Dr. Fromer . He made me what I 'm today ! Yeah , that 's right ! Jonas did it ! He 's gone cloning crazy ! Dr.Fromer has absolutely nothing to do with any of this . Max is just protecting him . I 'm not.That 's the truth I can explain everything . - He cloned me . It was him , It 's all him ! Would you shut the fuck up ? You , yes I 've been watching you . I know you 're even more loyal to Dr. Fromer , than Max is . I need the truth . Go ahead , Felix.Tell them He 's been kissing my ass for years . He knows what I 'm capable of . Tell them ! - You know what ? Max is full of shit . These people are clones , but , ah , Dr. Fromer told me ... that he planned on making a human clones ... with that Replicator . He 's a mad man ! No , no ! - guards . - guards ! Wait ! Stay back ! Stay back . No , you idiotes ! They 're lying ! And I can prove it . Just let me get a blood sample . Ouch ! You dick ! You rock . I should 've known a long time ago . SPRlNGDALE PROFESSOR CAUGHT IN HUMAN CLONING SHEME . Listen to me.Listen to me . I have a banana Hi , Felix . How are you ? - Hey.fine , how are you ? - Fine . - Good to see you . You too . You want it , don 't you ? Come on , get the banana . Sure.We could use the Replicator to clone ... ah , Rhinos ? But we have to build a much bigger unit , obviuosly . Can I call you back , Mafuzi ? Yes , Sir . Hakuna Matata . Hey.What you got there ? We got the cover ! - Do you like it ? - Wow . - How cute you look ? - Oh , Kate . We gotta celebrate . I should call Henry and Repli ... No , no , no . I 've rather celebrate it alone . Oh , I can do that . Refill . Yeah.sorry , I was finishing the dishes , Ah , listen , babe , ah , Don 't get me wrong , I 'm not complaining . Because , this is just great . - Hmm ? Well , I was thinking , may be one time , You and I can go out for dinner , and not watch sports . You know , somewhere we could use a knife and a fork . Wouldn 't that be romantic ? You know what would be romantic ? What ? ah . Ten minutes of silence . I just got words , Repli-Jonas has escaped from the facility where they were studying him , And noone knows where he is ! - Don 't worry . He 's a fully grown idiot , with no skills . How far could he possibly go . Penis !

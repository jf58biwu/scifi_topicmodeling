 Fixed Synced By MoUsTaFa ZaKi - Thanks for the beer . - Thanks for the lift . - So , big plans for the weekend ? - Oh , huge . Microwave pizza , satellite TV . Wow . Thanks for making my life sound exciting . Maybe we both need pets . They say people with pets live longer . I was thinking about getting a cat . There 's dog people and there 's cat people . You are a dog person , John . - How do you figure ? - ( laughs ) You 're faithful . You 're dependable . You 're without guile . And you 're very comfortable to be around . So why a cat ? Low maintenance . They don 't expect much from you , so you can 't disappoint them . I don 't see you ever disappointing anyone , John . See you Monday ? Yeah . See ya . John , John , John . - ( doctor ) Miss ? - ( nurse ) Reyes . How are you feeling tonight ? You with us ? Hello ? Is anybody here ? Hello . It 's OK . I was a little freaked out too . At first . - Who are you ? - Steven Murdock . I ... I don 't even know if that matters any more , but my name is Steven . Did you just look outside ? Yeah . Don 't do that . Where did everybody go ? I think the question is : where did we go ? Were you in an accident ? I think I was hit by a car on my way home . I came in with chest pains . Mr Barreiro ! Someone new . I found Mr Barreiro wandering around here , same as you . He fell at a construction site where he used to work . You think we 're dead . No . No , I don 't believe that . Have you ever been dead ? So how do you know you 're not ? Hell of a thing to wake up to , huh ? We stopped after work . She had a beer . The man who hit her had 15 . Don 't do this to yourself , John . It 's true , John . She 's gone . I don 't accept that . Look at her breathing . Her heart 's still beating . There 's gotta be hope . There 's no measurable electrical activity in her brain . Brain death is indeed death , John . I 'm sorry . The thing is , it 's not that bad ... once you get used to the idea . Have you seen this ? It 's nonsense , all of it . There 's not a single sign on any of the walls here . Why is that ? You say we 're dead . This seem like heaven to you ? A big , deserted Catholic hospital ? I didn 't say this was heaven . For all I know , it 's ... it 's hell . I don 't know anything for sure . Maybe this place is a way station , a stop on the road to what comes next . - Where are you going ? - I 'm finding a way out . Jack Preijers _ I 'm very sorry for your loss . Look , you two are the experts , but there 's gotta be something more that can be done . I wish there were . And I don 't mean to make this any harder , but I do have information you both need to hear . Your partner had a living will . She signed an organ donor card . Uh-uh . No way . - John ... - Just slow down , all right ? She 's lying there in one piece . There 's no fractures , no damage to her skull . Does that add up to you ? John , at the end of the day , it doesn 't matter . That doesn 't change the diagnosis or her prognosis . In these situations time is always of the essence . There is a woman in Minnesota who can be saved by your friend 's heart . In a real sense she will live on . Mr Murdock ? Mr Barreiro ? You ! Stop ! ( Murdock ) Monica ! Monica ! What 's happening to him ? ( screams ) - Oh , my God ! - ( screams ) ( flatline signal ) ( woman sobbing ) I am so very sorry for your loss . Hey . They 're burning up the phone lines down there , arranging with all these other hospitals how to divvy up IVlonica . They say they could do it as early as tomorrow . Is there anything ? Anything at all ? I did note minor swelling in the left anterior , consistent with subdural haematoma _ Minor Swelling ? I don 't know if that means anything . It 's not like there 's an exact formula for how much damage equals death . What about this ? This was monitoring her brain activity , the electrical impulses ? Yeah . She had EEG monitoring after the point that she coded . So then , it just stopped here . Right here . And if we can learn what this is , maybe we can reverse it . Agent Doggett ? OK . So this woman you saw , she went through the wall ? I don 't know . She was here , and then she disappeared . Disappeared ? What do you mean ? Like Mr Barreiro did ? Different than Barreiro . OK , OK . Let 's concentrate on one unexplainable event at a time here . What the hell happened to Mr Barreiro ? My opinion ? I think he died . You can 't die if you 're already dead , which backs up my belief that you and I are alive . - I have no idea where she went . - Hold on . If he 's dead and we 're not , then where the hell are we ? Dr Preijers . I 'll be there in one minute . I 'm wondering about this moment on my partner 's EEG tape , 8 _ 11 pm , when brain death apparently occurred . - You 're reviewing our records ? - No of fence , but yeah . I need to know if there 's a change in her condition before this . If you 're trying to build a malpractice case ... I 'm not . I just want the facts . Whitney , would you pull the code notes from earlier tonight , please ? Look , Monica had a seat belt and an air bag protecting her . The ambulance crew said she was conscious at the scene . I think we 're missing something . I don 't think this 'll help you any , but this describes what my team and I did to save her . You can take it , copy it , study it at your leisure . Dr Preijers ? It 's all right . You work here ? Um , I 'm a patient aid . I deliver the flowers , mostly . Are you her husband ? You love her , though . She 's not gone . Not her soul . I wish I could talk to her . I wish I could tell her . Guess I wish a lot of things . Come on . You 're not giving up , are you ? Monica . Please , don 't run . Who are you ? I 'm Audrey . I work at the hospital . Audrey , I 'm Monica . Steven and I just wanna get out of here . Will you show us the way out ? I Crucially I can 't help you . Why not ? I came to tell you , your friend ... Loves you very much . My friend ? Did you talk to John ? Does he know where I am ? They all think you 're dead . Wait ! Give my friend a message . Tell him he 's a dog person . - Hey , Whitney . - It 's not my place to say , but you might wanna review the code notes . Why ? There was an injection you gave Ms Reyes that wasn 't in the notes . I don 't think so . In trauma bay , I saw you administer an IV push . I assume it was epinephrine . I have no memory of that . - Anybody else see that ? - Just me . But it happened . My only point being , if there is an investigation , that 's the kind of inconsistency malpractice lawyers love to get ahold of . Whitney , thank you so much for looking out for me . ( muffled screams ) There 's cat people and there 's dog people . You are a dog person , John . You 're faithful . You 're dependable . You 're without guile _ And you 're very comfortable to be around . I don 't see you ever disappointing anyone , John . ( woman ) Oh , my God ! Get me some help in here ! What exactly are you thinking ? She helped work on Monica . I ask questions about what happened in the trauma bay , and she very inconveniently drops dead . You think somebody murdered her to cover something up ? If it were you , how would you make it look like natural causes ? I 'd use a fast-acting barbiturate like pentobarbital . I 'd use a small-bore needle to make it next to impossible to find an injection mark . " Next to impossible . " That 's why you 're perfect for the job . - Should probably test her blood too , right ? - Agent Doggett , I ... I 'm happy to do this for you . Just don 't kid yourself that this is gonna somehow bring her back . Your name is John , right ? She has a message for you . She says you 're a dog person . Wait . Where did you get that ? Who said that to you ? I told you . She 's not gone . I went through every last page of that before you ever got here . It 's just nonsense , just like you said . There 's not a clue in it . Maybe in itself it 's a clue . This place looks pretty complete at first glance , but really it 's not . There 's so much missing : words , details . It 's like a set , a movie set . But like it was built by someone who couldn 't quite grasp what it was they were recreating . Steven ? Are you OK ? Steven , talk to me . What ... What 's happening to me ? ( flatline signal ) Does he feel any pain ? Absolutely none . It 's just a matter of time now . - You live down here ? - The nuns let me stay . I wanted to be a nurse , only I can 't do much . But they let me help out . This is this hospital . You made this ? Why ? I like ' LO Visit it . I sort of go ... inside my head . You go into the model ? I like it there . It 's quiet . I used to have it all to myself , but then some people showed up . Hospital patients . Your friend . This is where you say you talk to her ? Right inside here ? Well ... Not so much like tiny people in a model , but ... Inside my head . Up here , I guess . You don 't believe me . Audrey ... You said that you saw some other people besides my friend . Other patients ? Can you tell me who they are ? ( gasping for breath ) There 's so much ... I 'd do differently . What ? Life . Monica 's parents are on their way from Mexico City , coming to say goodbye . They can say hello instead . Nobody 's shutting off her life-support system , not with what I got . What are these ? Patient files . Both men were declared braindead , same as her . All three have something else in common too . Check out the attending physician . Dr Jack Preijers . He 's some kind of Dr Death , gets off on pulling the plug on his own patients . Did it last night to this guy Barreiro . At the request of the family . What if he poisoned Barreiro in the first place ? Same as this guy Steven Murdock , same as Monica . The tox screen 'Il prove it . How did you come up with these two men 's names ? If I tell you that , you 'll think I 'm crazy . But Monica 's alive , same as this guy Murdock . We gotta help ' em both get back . Steven , stay with me . ( knocking ) Audrey , it 's John Doggett . - ( knocking ) - Audrey ? I still need your help . I told you their names - Mr Barreiro and Mr Murdock . They 're both dead . Monica 's the only one left . Inside an hour the hospital plans to cut off her life-support . I 'm not gonna let that happen , no matter what it takes , but I 'm losing here . Nobody else believes she 's alive . Nobody , just you and me . I can 't do anything . I only deliver the flowers . That 's all I do . I can 't help . You can talk to her , right ? You can . Audrey ... I need you to talk to her . I need you to tell her what 's going on . I need you to tell her that they 're gonna pull the plug . I need her to ... I need you to tell her to fight . I need you to tell her to show us some sign , anything , that she 's in there . I need her to understand . I don 't know what the hell else to do . Monica ? John wanted me to tell you something . You gave him my message ? He says you don 't have very long . He says you have to give them some kind of sign . I know . I 'm sorry . Are you really gonna leave me here to die ? I can 't ... do anything . There 's something wrong . You know , up here ? And I can 't help anyone . I deliver the flowers . That 's all I do . And I have to even get help with that because I can 't read who 's on the little cards . You can 't read ? I see it all jumbled up . This is your hospital . It 's you who created it . It 's all you , Audrey . This place is all you . And that means you can make the rules work any damn way that you want them to . You can help me escape . Audrey ? ( door opens ) You know , I 've always wondered what was down here . I 'm being accused of things , Audrey . Terrible things regarding three patients of mine . Really , it 's beyond the pale . You 're not gonna yell out , are you , Audrey ? Audrey ? Audrey ? Audrey ? Audrey , what 's happening ? You have to go . This way . No . If I dO that , I 'll burn up . I 'll die . No . Not now . But you have to hurry . What about you ? I know now . I know who told me to build it . ( door opens ) The transplant teams are in place . They 're not cutting her up . John ... I 'm still waiting for your argument . If you have something to convince me to convince the doctors that sne 's alive . ( Reyes ) John ? Audrey . Where are you going , Doctor ? Oh , God . Oh , no . Good night .

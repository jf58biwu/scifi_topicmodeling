 Previously on Farscape You will never get the wormhole tech from me . I merely ... want to safeguard it and hope ... that when the inevitable Scarran bloodbath begins , you make the appropriate choices . Oh , so you 're here to be John 's protector ? Scorpius is here ... looking for the key to what is inside my head . He will use you ... and the baby ... and I will not be able to stop him . D 'Argo , Rygel and Scorpius are boarding LoLah . I gotta go . I gotta go look after Scorpius . We should do it together . No , you know we can 't do that together . Besides , you 've got to look after the girls . That 's not fun . It 's more fun than Mental Arts Training Camp . Grayza ... does not want Earth . Grayza ... wants you . Why do I always attract the psychos ? Braca , prepare the marauders . Set course for our meeting with the Scarrans . Yes , Ma 'am . What shall I do ? Stall her , Braca . I 'm not given to exaggeration , but ... the future of Peacekeeper survival depends on you . And now , on Farscape ... Rygel ... what is wrong with you ? I don 't think I 've ever seen you not eat for so long . I 'm learning self-discipline that Katoya taught me . Besides ... none of you can cook . Well , you could cook for yourself . Yah , I really should cook something for the girls . They 're due back . They 'll be hungry when they get here . They are overdue , I believe . You brought us to a dead Leviathan ? The carcass has been fused to this planetoid to house a commerce settlement . It 's an unimpressive settlement . I doubt we 'll find what we 're looking for . If we want to camouflage Moya against long-range scans , this is the place . Well , it doesn 't look like it . Well , if you were selling outlawed mods , would you want everybody knowing about it ? See these humble stalls ? They also sell genetic transformations , species blending and all the appropriate documents to go with it . A hundred percent natural ? My tullum ! You ought to be ashamed of yourself . This way . Hey , hey , hey ... We want to speak to Rekka . Sure you 've stumbled onto the right ... dead Leviathan ? I know you ... are his negotiator and I also know that you make your deals in this pile of dren . Perhaps you 'd like a ... private table . First round 's on the house . Care to hear our specials ? Not unless you have a discount on sensor distorters . Sensual consortors ? Is that some sort of pleasure toy ? Look . I know you have to check us out . That 's your job . That 's fine , but ... now that you know that I know what I 'm talking about , I suggest you start taking us seriously . I 'd love to take you ... seriously . Won 't your ... grandmother ... object ? Don 't drink them . They 're drugged . A suggestability potion , perhaps ? Such an old trick ... My apologies to you . And professional admiration for your skills . Thank you . May we see Rekka now ? Tell me what you need . What do you want ? We need a sensor distorter for our ship , to fool long-range scans . And what do you want to ... look like ? An oil freighter . A fast ... pleasure yacht with a jacuzi . What about several ... choices of energy signatures ? Well , I need to check your sensor modulator . Do you ... ladies know what that looks like ? Gee ! I guess we do . That 's partly organic ... Leviathan . Very good . Distorter will only fool a warship if your movements exactly match your new identity . Is your pilot that good ? - Yes . - No ! Your problem , not mine . Leviathans need custom builds . I 'm going to have to take your modulator . That 'll leave Moya half blind . It 'll take four arns . Four ? And nineteen thousand crindars . What ? And we 'll give you some complimentary tokens to the facilities of your choice . How bout ... I offer you some complimentary choices ? Would that lower your price ? Thirty thousand . And if it 's that ... forty thousand . Be nice . Sixteen thousand . Half up front . Meet us at your pod . Do you know where it is ? Yes , we know where it is . Be there in four arns . That 's too long . Our deal ... our rules . Take these tokens and enjoy yourselves in the meantime . Do we trust them ? Of course not . What do we do ? Just keep an eye on them , Chi . Sixteen thousand crindars . Not bad . Not bad at all . Now what ? Wait a minute . Where 's Noranti ? Frell ! Get down . There 's Peacekeepers . What ? How many ? Grayza ... Braca ... four SSD 's . No . They could not have followed us here . That is impossible . Unless someone tipped them . You are sure they 're coming , Ma 'am ? Of course I 'm sure . Keep searching . Keep searching . Subtitles by PK-SUB66 " Bringing home the beacon " Chiana ? Chiana , can you hear me ? Why are the comms frelled ? Peacekeepers must have jammed them , Aeryn . We need ... to stick together . - One weapon ... I have , six of them . - And two outlaws who are on the same side . - Noranti , there are six Peacekeepers . - Grayza , Braca , four SSD Commandos . Can you find Chiana ? Can you warn her ? - We 've got four long arns to stay low . - Yes . Yes , of course . As I see it , we have several choices . We can follow Grayza , find out what she 's up to or we can stay out of sight . Say . May I serve you ? Yah . I 'm just lookin for , uh , two gentlemen that just came through here . One 's tall , dark hair . The other 's , um ... - bald on top , shorter , hair out sideways . - I haven 't seen anyone of that description . - Are you , uh ... quite sure ? - Um hum . What 's in there ? Services . Expensive ... services . Well , I don 't mind expensive services as long as they 're worth paying for . - Do you hear that ? - Certainly do . - Unusual sonic pattern . - Double-winged . - Sounds like a Stryker . - I agree . - Fastest ship in the Scarran fleet . - But what the frell is it doing here ? And Grayza seems to recognize it too . ... information . What are you going to do now ? Nebari neural note . What 's that ? We begin the manipulation here . You carry a lot of tension in your skrillum . Oh , yah ! Tell me about it ! How does this feel ? Yah ! Yah ! Dig deeper . Deeper , yah . How 's this ? Sestra . Hey , uh ... the reason why I 'm ... I 'm really tense is because I 've been following these ... these two Sebacean males and I ... uh , I ... I think they came in here . And I ... I was wondering if you could help me out . I can 't move . Well ... pinch of pressure on the milla nerve paralyzes a Nebari from the neck down . Permanently ? That depends . Look ... I 'm just a runaway Nebari . A crook , just like everybody else . - Just ... ask ... ask Rekka . - Rekka ? Ah ! Frell ! You know , I ... I ... I forgot to tell him something and ... and it would be really great if you could help me out . You have any idea what else we sell here ? Yah ! Genetic modification . Shape changes . That 's right . And whoever buys a tranformation kit also buys confidentiality . So , he 's probably just walked straight by me . Gezzah ! A Scarran ! A Scarran delegation . One 's a member of the ruling caste . - Four Charrid escorts . - One Commander , one Adjutant , four warriors . - Same as the other side . - Which implies a meeting . - Why ? Why would she meet with them ? - Grayza clearly isn 't interested in us , so ... - ... if we go and get the modulator , this provides a perfect opportunity for us to leave here . - No , no , no , no ... This is a perfect opportunity for us to stay . Otherwise we learn nothing ! Does this look like an official conference to you ? On a remote planet with no Scarran Proconsul ? No . Exactly . She 's most likely exceeding her authority . If we could somehow make Peacekeeper High Command privy to that ... They will relieve her of her duty . We get her off our backs . There 's an awful lot of ' if 's ' , Aeryn . Have we been in a more fortuitous position to try than now ? How could I possibly ... serve you ? - I 'm looking for a Nebari girl , this high ... kind of gray . - Marella ! Another one ? Ahh ! There she is . Psst ! We have to go find the pod now and go to the modulator - because there are visitors here that we 'd rather not run into . - Are you frelled ? We 're all frelled . Grayza and Braca are here with four SSD Commandos . - Grayza and Braca ? - Oh , you 've seen them too ? No , no , no . Aeryn ? Can you hear me ? Oh , no , no , no , no . She can 't . What 's with the comms ? They 're pranked . Peacekeepers ... jamming . Oh , come on . We 've gotta go ! Peacekeepers ... A Nebari female ... Commandos . ... report immediately to a Peacekeeper . Transform us ! Full genetic modification . Good enough to , uh ... to pass DNA scan . But you have to select a species before we can ... - Well ... we 're not really that choosy . - No , no , not , not , not . - Maybe make me a bit bulbous . - Yeh , yeh , yeh , yes . - Eyes ? Eyes would be great ! - Oh , eyes ! - Oh ... you ... you choose . - Yes , you choose . Not ... not ... nothin too special . Well , I 'll do this one . You ... service her . Come on . The site is secure . You won 't mind if we confirm that for ourselves ? If you feel it necessary . My troops are continuing to patrol the area . How reasurring ! We 're too far away . This magnifies sound as well as image . Tell what 's happening , or I 'll take over . Commandant Grayza ... Minister Ahkna ... That is War Minister Ahkna . Third in rank in the Scarran fleet . Wow ! You 've abided by the terms of this meeting ? Exactly as we agreed . You 'll have to take my word for it . You 've been conditioned to resist Scarran mind-probing . We all have . Oh , my ... What ? Shh ... shh ... shh ... Will you take my word on that ? Or will you waste more time , testing us ? I dislike wasting time . Why are you here ? As I communicated ... I want peace . Everyone wants peace . But what price will you pay to achieve it ? What if I were to offer you ... the Luxan Territories ? - Frell ! - Will you tell me ? ! Grayza says she is willing to cede all the Luxan worlds to the Scarrans in exchange for peace . What ? She can 't mean it . The Peacekeepers and the Luxans have a mutual defense pact . Grayza has to be bluffing . She can 't fulfill that promise . The Luxans would go to war . And how long could the Luxans hold out against the Scarrans without the support of the Peacekeepers ? If that really is Grayza 's intention , we can 't let her go through with it . I doubt we could talk her out of it , Aeryn . I wasn 't thinking of talking . I have a gun . - You would assassinate Grayza ? - She 'd do the same to us . All right . - Then what ? Do you have any plan of escape ? - Run . - Anything more detailed , Aeryn ? - Run quickly . And what if we run ... into more opposition than we can handle ? You have the conversation with D 'Argo about why his worlds were obliterated . In return for dominion over the Luxan territories , the Scarrans will relinquish all claims to the disputed sectors of the Uncharted Territories . Disputed sectors being ... ? Everywhere beyond the Kellek Nebula . - Hardly an equitable exchange . - More than equitable . The Luxan worlds are wealthy . There 's little of value in the Uncharted Territories . So , why would you make such an exchange ? Especially now . The Luxans are your allies . High Command already regrets that decision . Luxans are warriors , not diplomats . They are a liability to our peace efforts . So ... you would just abandon them ? Yes ! For the greater good . We are also aware of how long you have coveted their resources . In the same way you 've coveted the expansion room the Uncharted Territories would give you . Each party gains advantages ... and a costly war is averted . You would never get your Council to support such a treaty . A majority of the Counselors already support me . They are ready for a change of leadership . You ... would seize power ? For the greater good . The beneficial effects of this treaty will also , of course , speed your ascent through the Scarran hierarchy . I need no help in that regard . Ahh ! ? How many cycles ago was your father deposed ? How long since your last promotion ? Too long . But then I don 't resort to the methods you utilize to advance . Would you have a weapon in your armory and leave it unused ... out of squeamish good taste ? Captain Braca ! It 's all right . Yes ? We have word of a Nebari female somewhere in the settlement . Description matches the escapee , Chiana . Stay here . I 'll check it out . You ! Nebari ... Female . - You look fine . - I look hideous . No wisdom creases . No memory lines . My eye ! Whoa . - Look , I 've earned all these things ... - Shut your wacket hole . Let me do the talking , okay ? We 're looking for a female Nebari . You ! You ! We 're looking for a Nebari . Female . Well , then try Soorat 's . Level Three . Any kind of f ... f ... female you could care for . Right ... Hands ... off . I 'm not on the market . Besides , I don 't even like men ... - What are you doing ? - DNA scan . Be quiet . Oh , quiet ? Quiet , my eema . - No match . - What ? - Just because you 've got a fancy uniform , does that make you important ? - Old woman . Ooh . What is that ? What is that ? Drugs ? Ooh ! I don 't need drugs . I 've got true love . You don 't need drugs if you 've got true love . You . Have you seen a Nebari female ? Well , I wouldn 't know one if it bit me on the prang . Though that could be fun . Gray girl . Thin . Young . Good looking ? Mmm . We only even notice ... the good looking ones . I said " I " would do the talking . Well , you didn 't say all the talking . I thought we did rather well . Come on . We 've got to get back to Aeryn before the treatment wears off . They 're still arguing about how to carve up the Uncharted Territories . But you still believe that Ahkna wants the deal to go ahead ? Yes . I do . So , you would approve a division point at the Lanthal System . In principle , yes . Then it would seem we have an agreement . First , let 's talk about disarmament . I 'm not prepared to discuss that . At present , I 'll deal only with territory , not weapons . Unsatisfactory . You claim you have military superiority . We do more than claim ! Yet you will not even talk about arms reduction . We are prepared to coexist in peace , but not to make ourselves vulnerable . There are some in our hierarchy who believe you are already vulnerable . That your claims to military superiority are exaggerated . Perhaps the loss of our Dreadnaught was only an experiment that you haven 't been able to repeat . Or ... perhaps it wasn 't you who did it . If this is so ... why should we settle for peace ? Because you would lose a war . Ahkna 's suspicious . She thinks the Peacekeepers might be lying about having wormhole weapons . The fear of wormhole weapons is the only thing stopping Scarrans from invading Peacekeeper space . Without them thinking they 've got those weapons , everyone 's frelled . Grayza is making out a document . Ahkna is looking it over . Okay . It 's time to intervene . - Maintain internal alert . - What ? Full search pattern . The treaty appears satisfactory . It is . Your Captain should bear witness . There is no need to wait for him ... if you 're ready . Pennoch ... bear witness . It 's too late . They 've already signed . Kill her anyway . They will never enforce a treaty if she 's dead . I can 't get a shot . There was no Nebari , Ma 'am . No matter , Captain Braca . This ... was an historic day . Congratulations . Pennoch ! Ahkna , you are a fool . This is an act of war . I assure you , Commandant , you won 't be missed . You would not dare murder me . We merely want to speak in much more detailed terms about your wormhole capabilities . You already know that you 'll learn nothing . No , not here . But our facilities are so much better on Katratzi . They 'll interrogate her now . What happens when they learn the truth about wormhole weapons ? They won 't . We can 't let them . - Sikozu ... - Shh , shh ! Frell ... Follow them . Go . What the frell happened to you two ? - We needed a camouflage to fool the DNA scans . - It isn 't permanent . Have you got the modulator ? - Not yet . What are the Scarrans doing here ? - Doesn 't matter . - Whatever it takes , get the modulator and meet us back at the pod . - Right . Go . Right . We 're low on weapons . Huhh ! I didn 't bring any guns . I don 't have any guns . - What can you do ? What can you make ? - Fyang powder . It 's a wonderful substance . It 'll put anyone to sleep instantly . - Good . - Except I don 't have any . - Not good . - However , this looks like ... mayla spores . They 're very powerful . Scarrans ... Charrids ... will it work on them ? I 've never tried on either . Ahkna , this blunder will cost you dearly . Hmm ! The blunder was yours , Commandant . You 've just guaranteed yourselves a war you cannot win . Our wormhole technology will decimate your planet . You terrify me . Do we need this one ? Yes , we do . When he no longer has a use , may I be the one to dispose of him ? Yes , you may . Let us prepare the Stryker and summon the Dreadnaught to the rendezvous point . We won 't be long . How are you going , Noranti ? Preparing mayla spores takes time . And spit . We never have enough time . I don 't have enough spit but I 'm doing what I can . Alright , they took Grayza and Braca into bay nine , but their Stryker 's still powered down . So we have enough time to ... No . Two Charrids came back out . They 're heading this way now . Two ? You heard Ahkna 's orders . If you see a Peacekeeper Commando , shoot to kill . - Identify yourself . - Don 't shoot . I know who you are . - What are you doing ? - And I know who you 're looking for . You don 't have to harm me . I can show you where to find the ones you 're seeking . - Tell me where they are . - Just a microt . My nose . I ... . I need ... I need a ... ahh ... ahh choo ! ... just a sneeze . I 'm sorry . I said I could help to find the ones you seek , and I will ... show you . Right now ... there 's one behind you . Right there . A Peacekeeper . Whoa . I must remember to get more mayla spores . Yes . That was good . Thank you . Now , I know it 's not your color but ... It 'll get us into bay nine . Oh please , let me go . I ... I 'm not a Peacekeeper . I don 't even know any Peacekeepers . You 've got the wrong young female . Oh , please , please ! I 'm being attacked by one ... by two ... of you . Hey , gorgeous ! Hello ! That leaves us one Charrid , two Scarrans ... And two Peacekeepers . Commandant ... Aeryn Sun ... Exceptional work . And congratulations on your Luxan treaty . For that alone , I shall kill you both . Aeryn ... . Alive I can repudiate that treaty . But you proposed it , and you signed it . And if the Scarrans had not betrayed me , I 'd have stood by it . We could have lived in peace . Without me ... how are you planning to get past the Command Carrier that 's orbiting this dead leviathan ? If I 'm not back at the pod in half an arn , you go without me . - What ? - Go . I 'll cover . Move . Into the café ! Into the café ! No . The pod is that way . No , Noranti . We 're gonna to wait here for Aeryn . - Aeryn is dead by now . - I said keep moving ! - She 's right ... - ... to the back ! ... Killing Charrids is one thing , but two Scarrans ? I said shut up ! It was a great sacrifice on her part . It isn 't over . She will survive . Alone ? She 's got no chance . Maybe you should go and help her and I 'll take these two to the pod . No , Noranti . We have one weapon ! The Scarrans will be here any microt . This area is undefendable . - Might I suggest ... - Shut up ! If we stay ... we die . - It would be a great pity if Aeryn 's death were for nothing . - She 's not dead ! This way . Prime the marauder . We must leave immediately . Why did you do that ? We don 't like trespassers . This is my pod ... okay ? I got transformed . Look . Look at me . It 's me . Seriously , now ... we do have a strict policy . Nobody steals our client 's ships . Noranti ? Noranti ! You all right ? Up you get . I swear to you ... I 've been genetically transformed to fool the Peacekeepers . You gave me the frelling tokens . - It 's her . - Are you sure ? They didn 't transform her tongue . In that case ... here 's your modulator , with the sensor distorter installed . You do still want this ? Plug it into the neela trunk ... your pilot will feel his options . Hey ! Do I get a discount for being knocked out ? We should charge you more for guarding your pod . What 's going on ? Thanks for your patronage . - Are you all right ? - Yah . Let 's get this pod started . Shouldn 't we wait for Aeryn ? We 'll wait half an arn , like she said . So where is she ? Are you all right ? Where are the Scarrans ? What if they get here first ? If the Scarrans get here first , then we leave immediately because Aeryn is as good as dead . It 's almost time . No . We need to find Aeryn . Once , Chiana , please . For once in your life , exercise some self-control . I am exercising self-control . - I 'm not blasting off your head . - Stop ! Stop . She 's coming . Oh , thank Jonna ! - Are you all right ? - Yes . I 'm fine . All right . Sit down and hold on . Pilot , any word ? Yes , Ka D 'Argo . As you speak , a transport pod is approaching at high speed . Have they signaled distress ? No . Have we signaled Rygel 's distress ? Inadvisable as that would confirm our position to the Scarran warship pursuing them . Pilot , starburst as soon as they 're aboard . I am already preparing , Captain . Stand by for starburst ... now ! Do you really ... need to do that ? Remarkable . Well , changing my genetics changes my scent . Is it permanent ? Do you want it to be ? I prefer the elegant gray . You paid too much . Ahh ! You don 't even know " if " I paid . It was still too much . I 'll reimburse you double if you can cook for me . I may never cook again . Noranti , please ! It 's not your fault . We had her . We let her go . Well , you 're here . She 's not . I 'll take that trade . She tried to strike a deal . Ahkna wouldn 't go for it . The Scarrans must be dead set on war . That 's Scorpy 's line . Let someone else lose sleep over it tonight . What should we lose sleep over ? Careful . Everyone . Despite our starburst , the Scarran warship is still in pursuit at the extreme edge of Moya 's senses . How 'd they find us so fast ? - Try a homing beacon . - Pilot ? I 'm not detecting any signals . Huh , John 's right . Must be a beacon . Chiana ? Nope , nothing in the pod . Still looking . I am certain ... the sensor distorter contains no transmitter or homing beacon of any sort . Alright , it 's not the hardware . Try the software . Pilot ? Adjusting now . Anything from that planet ... anything . You know , it could be her . We were separated . I did not betray you . What ? You want me to undress ? The DRD 's detect nothing from either Sikozu , Chiana or Noranti . Nothing from Aeryn , either . A tier-by-tier search of this vessel would be the unavoidable next step . There 's no time for that . The Scarran warship is now on the edge of Moya 's sense horizon . Have they found us again ? Frell me ! Soon enough . - Can Moya starburst ? - Not for some time . Activate the sensor distorter . It is not ready yet . - How long until the warship identifies us ? - Perhaps two hundred microts . - I hate to say it , but ... - Then don 't ! No one is chasing Moya and Pilot . It might be better just to leave them . Are we gonna do this ? Bail ? Safest for Moya . What about the baby . What about the baby ? What ? Where 's the beacon ... Aeryn ? We ... don 't know . - Where 's the beacon , Aeryn ? - We don 't know . - Crichton , what ... ? ! - Wait ! Where 's the beacon ? Crichton ... what 're you doing ? Where 's the beacon ? It 's a simple question , where 's the beacon ? We don 't know where the beacon is . Crichton , what are you doing ? Where 's the beacon ? - Where 's the baby ? - I don 't ... Where 's the baby ? Where 's the beacon ? Beacon , baby . Beacon , baby ... Whose beacon ? Whose baby ? Who 's the beacon ? Who 's the baby ? Whose baby is it ? Who 's the daddy , Aeryn ? Aeryn , who 's the daddy ? D 'Argo , tell her who the daddy is . We don 't know ... who the daddy is . Right , we don 't know ... who . Say ' baby ' , Aeryn . Aeryn , say ' baby ' . Say ' baby ' . Spell it . A-b-c-d-e-f-g ... h-i-j ... Where 's Aeryn ... Aeryn ? A bioloid . What 's a bioloid ? That . Thirty microts , everyone , until the Scarran warship is close enough to identify us . Pilot , I have temporarily patched ... the sensor distorter ... to your neural pathway . I ... feel it . There is a choice of signatures . A Scarran ore freighter , and mimic its movements . Engaging now . The Scarran warship is signaling . Okay , let 's hear it . The mother-tongue . You ! The warship is breaking off ... and accelerating away . What did you say to them ? I told them that we saw ... a Leviathan starburst a moment ago ... that we were afraid it was going to board us and I thanked them for scaring it away . Homing device ... Found in what 's left of it 's neural processor . That device confining Grayza was not meant to transport her . No ... it replicates living flesh . We 've known about it for some time ... but never encountered the result . Effective technique . No rescue attempt , while they 're at their leisure to torture Grayza . And now ... her duplicate spies on the Peacekeepers . Then why did they take Aeryn ? I got away . She ... got caught . Maybe they thought this ... creature ... would bring back Grayza . Or Crichton ... Sikozu . You okay ? No . You know ... it 's not Aeryn . It was never Aeryn . We 're not gonna give up on her , John . Sikozu said the Scarrans are taking Grayza to a place called ' Katratzi ' . Maybe that 's where Aeryn is now . She could be anywhere out there . But we 're not going to let her go . I give you my word . Subtitles by the PK-SUB66 team

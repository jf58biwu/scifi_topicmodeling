 Previously on Farscape . Radiation . Massive radiation . I 've never felt better . The , uh ... other ... Crichton ... is dead . I just can 't watch that happen ... again . We were so ... perfect and you 're just like him . I mean you are him . No . I 'm me . You give me what I want , or I swear ... I will keep you alive so that you can witness your home worlds destruction ! I suggest you hang onto something . Talyn ... Starburst . This ship ... is dead ! The wormhole experiment is over Aeryn ... Fly safe . We all knew the time would come when we 'd split up . In the beginning , I would never even have believed it could take so long . Don 't think I 'm gonna to miss you . Any of you . I 'm not . Well , maybe a little bit . And now on Farscape ... It doesn 't work . Oh ... yes it does . Just not ... for the wedding . John ? You wear this ... and somebody 's gonna marry you . Come on , Crichton ... I 've been to a few different places . Your world can 't be that hard to adjust to . You still have to ask her . Doesn 't work that way . Might I interject ? Would you like some yirgra fungal chowder ? Oh well , perhaps Aeryn wouldn 't have liked your planet anyway . Okay . Big moment . You 're up . Come on . " Sarge It . " " Chh ... " Again , " chh ... " . " Sarch It . " Where 's she from ? Like ... Bosnia ? Charge it . Thank you . I told you ! No , look , that was good . She almost understood what you said . That was completely embarrassing . Baby , look . English is a very difficult language . Half the time people don 't understand what I 'm talkin ' about . - You 're doing great . - No . I 'm not . Nobody here understands what I 'm saying . This whole frelling planet needs translator microbes Hey , old woman . Why didn 't you leave with the others ? Because I knew the souffle ' would charm you . Chowder . You said it was chowder . I can make you a chowder ! Pip ? Who is that woman ? I thought she was with you . Look at this ... Pilot ? I 'm seeing another Leviathan . We have arrived at the Leviathan burial place . D 'Argo , how much are you taking ? Macton 's posting 's a long way away . Thanks . You could resupply during the journey . Well , revenge is a feast best served immediately . You 're gonna get yourself killed . We all are . At least we 'll do it on our home planets . I 'm surprised that Crais sacrificed himself . Talyn was such a fine ship . Can 't believe this is all that 's left of him . So , what 're you going to do after we bury Talyn ? Same thing I 'm doing now . Work on wormhole theory . Vision ? D-d-darkness . M-m-moya s-s-swallowed . Pilot ? Is everything okay ? No , Commander ! Brace for collision , everybody ! Brace for collision ! Pilot Oh ! Praise the spirit ! I 'm never gonna finish this recipe . My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut ... shot through a wormhole ... . In some distant part of the universe ... . I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship ... this living ship ... of escaped prisoners ... My friends ... If you can hear me ... beware ... if I make it back ... will they follow ? If I open the door ... are you ready ? Earth is unprepared , helpless ... for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay , protect my home , not show them you exist . But then you 'll never know ... the wonders I 've seen . Total crap . Completely dead . Pilot , how long ? Soon . Moya is rallying herself to recovery . That lunatic Leviathan 's still out there . Hasn 't moved . Just staring us down . Central pumping mechanism is a total loss . Tier three is under water . Conduit bulkhead breach . A Janz-2 torpedo could not have done it better . That crazy tralk really knew where to hit us , didn 't she ? Moya 's nerval crytex is impossible to target so successfully unless by another Leviathan . Pilot . What the yotz brought this on ? I still haven 't made contact with the other Pilot , however , it appears to have something to do with Talyn . Oh , Talyn again ? I told you we should have dumped his debris . We wouldn 't even be here ... Without Talyn , you wouldn 't be here , so show some respect . Respect ? ! My tiny , shiny , hiney ! It 's gonna get us killed ! And , who the frell is this ? One ... two ... three And reroute Moya 's systems to help in the recovery process . Does everyone know what to do ? Crichton Pay attention ! This is serious ! Uh . Yeah . It 's a good plan . Thank you , thank you very much . Thank you . That 's my cousin , Susan ... . Congratulations . John ... Tonight you are the second luckiest man on Earth . Know what I mean ? Though still groggy , Moya informs me that each of this Leviathan 's last three offspring were captured and enslaved by Peacekeeper hunters . And she won 't let Talyn be buried in the sacred space because he 's half Peacekeeper . This ship is quite irrational and , as we 've seen , prepared to enforce her edict . Can 't you work this out with the other pilot ? He has yet to return my communication , but I 'm trying . That 's certainly true . Pay attention ! Uh ! Fahrbot ! When we get out of this , are you still gonna look for that ex-Peacekeeper unit ? Can you keep the light on where I 'm working ? Sorry . They assassinate people , right ? The squad aims to stop terrorism and protect people . Didn 't you learn anything on the Command Carrier ? Want some advice ? Look , Jool . I 'm not Crichton 's mate . I 'm not tied to him in any way . In the short time I 've known you , you 've changed so much . Don 't go backwards . Assassinating people ? Seems like going backwards . Can you melt that ? With what ? There 's no power yet . Thank you . Hammond-side 's tight . Looks like Moya 's gonna be okay . Hey , you know ... you know what I said before about ... about not wanting you to come with me ? That wasn 't exactly right . Pip , it 's cool . Where ya been ? Not now . This is not right . I would love you ... to come with me . But , you know , I ... I gotta find my brother and ... and he 's in this resistance thing and ... and as if I 'm gonna find him ... hangin ' out with someone ... who looks like ... A ... Peacekeeper ? It 's cool . What 're we gonna do if this crazy tralk doesn 't let Moya into the burial grounds ? Perhaps I can offer the benefit of my training ? What , how ? As a chef ? And doctor . Instructor . And , among many other disciplines , negotiator . Listen , Wrinkles . How ' bout you just stick to the chowder ? You can deal with the old frellnik . Damn ! I can 't see . God ! Go to the truth . It calls in your own tongue . Ignore it ... and risk ... all . NO ! Get down ! Get down ! What the frell happened to him ? Uh ... Uh , nothing ... nothing . He 'll be fine . What did you do ? Perhaps a slight misjudgment of his weight . It won 't occur again , I 'm certain . So am I. Aeryn , D 'Argo the Leviathan killed her own pilot ... nutrient starvation ! Why would she do that ? I 'm not sure , but she threatens to attack again if Moya does not take Talyn 's remains and vacate the area . Never one to say I told you so , but ... shall we go ? Well , I can 't believe I 'm agreeing with Rygel , but under the circumstances ... with Moya injured . Moya feels Talyn has earned the right to be buried in the sacred space , and she will not yield . Don 't you ever get bored , living on the same planet , never going anywhere ? And what about living in a house ? It 's too quiet . There 's no engine noise . Well , wait till summer when the air conditioning kicks on . John has this fantasy about us ... having kids and dogs and a pool ... and barbecues ... Must seem a strange culture . Jack . I am ... miserable here . And he just doesn 't see it . I 'm ... going to get married ... end up like Betty Crocker . I just keep wondering when he 's gonna wake up . I 'm awake . You all right ? Well ... between the witch and the Luxan ... Still ? The other Leviathan killed her own pilot , and Moya won 't back down . Can Moya beat her ? Damage is too great . We could dodge for a while but eventually ... We have to cut and run . Pilot can 't convince her and , uh , Chiana and Rygel are trying . Sparky and Pip ? If you untie me , I shall volunteer again to mediate , ev-ev-even though . I ... I know that , um ... Who is that woman ? Listen ... Moya . ... everyone is uh ... is really concerned ... about your plan . I ... I mean , even Aeryn thinks that ... that maybe Talyn should be laid to rest someplace else . I once , uh ... I once asked Zhaan ... I once asked Zhaan ... h-h-how she got along with you so well . She ... she ... she said that uh ... that the-the key that the-the key was to be honest ... was to be honest ... no matter what no matter what . Well , Moya ... this-this is what I th ... I think that you should bury Talyn where ever you frelling wanna bury Talyn ! And I think that the ... that the frelling tralk should ... should get out of our frelling way . There . That 's what I think . Hey Crichton . Where ya been ? What is all this ? I ... went ... shopping ! Shopping ? You- - No , no ! You don 't have any money ! Lifting . Shop ... lifting . But , look ... look at these cool presents I bought the bridesmaids . You and Aeryn can give ' em to ' em . Sitdown ! Hey , I spent some time with the boys . Think I found who the best man is . W-w-why are you doing this ? Why can 't you just act like you always have ? Fit in . Why-why do you have to sleep with all of my friends ? ! This is such a repressed culture ! Back ! Son ? Dad . Dad ? Hi ! Son , your mother has been gone for so long . This is not right . That 's not ... right ! I do not agree , John . I think she has a point . You see ? D 'Argo , you don 't even know how to fly your ship . I do , in theory . And it certainly has enough fire power to destroy a Leviathan . It 's just not right . Why does it always have to be your plan ? It doesn 't . But I don 't think that Moya is gonna let us kill one of her own species . I have some information , and it 's worse than we thought . Apparently Moya is not the first to be attacked by this rogue Leviathan . Three others are already dead . Still more , grievously injured . Hang on ! Apologies . Moya is now responding defensively on her own . Moya understands the grief of losing a child , however this female 's behavior is unacceptable . She asks for your help . She has our backing , no matter what . Moya knows . Which is why she feels comfortable making this request . Kill the rogue Leviathan ! All right , old girl ! Not , you . - I 'll fly my ship . - Kill ? ! Yes Commander . Before she kills us ! So you 'll be there ? - Yeah . But Chiana can handle it ... - Just ... be there . Chiana midwifed Talyn 's birth . She shouldn 't have to bury him alone . I don 't make errors . That Leviathan can 't be stationary , but I 'm sure it 's not moving too fast . I know . It 's not too far , but it 's not too close either . Do you want me to shoot the frelling thing myself ? Even though it 's a disturbed creature , you 're still about to take a life ! Are you gonna be okay with that ? - Be careful . - I don 't have to fly with D 'Argo . I heard that . Now . Do you remember everything I told you about flying the ship ? Almost nothing . Excellent . Pilot . We are in position . Moya . It is time Talyn was laid to rest ... in the sacred place . Whew ! Okay . You ready ? We 're in ... we 're in ! What the yotz is so sacred about this ? All right . We 've got that rogue 's attention ... She 's now following us . Yes , I see her Rygel . Look , keep it steady ! If I don 't get accurate resonant capture , then we 're all done for . I thought you said this thing only responds to your DNA . It does . That 's why I covered all the controls ... Oh ... that 's ... why I 'm wearing gloves . D 'Argo , Crichton ? This Leviathan is a lot larger than Moya . The best I 'll be able to do is annoy her . That 's all right . Just keep her within range . We 'll give this slijnot something to focus on . Soon as I see Talyn 's remains , I shall commence a firing run . Just waiting on a go-ahead from D 'Argo . - I understand , it 's difficult . - It 's not difficult ! Yes it is ! Everybody thinks you 're a freak . Everyone thinks I 'm a freak . Hey boys ! How 're they biting ' ? - Terrible , Mr. D 'Argo . - Can you help again ? See . They don 't think I 'm a freak . What the hell 're you doin ? What do you think I 'm doing ? I 'm not entirely sure . But don 't kill Aeryn . I 'm not going to kill anyone ! Why are you so disagreeable ? - I 'm not disagreeable . - You are being disagreeable ! ... I got things on my mind . I am sorry that Aeryn is leaving you . But don 't take it out on me . I heard she left you at the altar . Shut up . It 's not just Aeryn . You 're all leaving . Whenever you thought you 'd found a wormhole , you fell over yourself to dive in . Don 't begrudge us our dreams . I don 't . It 's just a hell of a dream you got there , D , killin ' a man . I don 't wanna kill him . I just want revenge . What 'd you think you 're doin ' ? You know , when all of this is over John , I think you should head straight for Earth . No . That 's not an option . The Peacekeepers would follow . You know , I should never have come here . I should never have come to Earth . I should have left you guys on Moya . If it 's such a simple choice . Why 're you agonizing over it ? Because I 'm an idiot . Yeah , you are an idiot ! I 'm an idiot . We 're all idiots , aren 't we boys ? Everyone 's an idiot ! Speaking of idiots ... that cannot be right . One shot ! And you said I 'd never fit in here . Never said that . Yes , you did . No , I didn 't . I remember ... you did . He 's armed and he 's dangerous ! Talyn ... He , uh ... he-he was our protector our family . May I say a few words ? He he was a lost soul searching for , ah ... Talyn was special . joy to his Mother , and a credit to his species ... both of them . With fondness , we lay Talyn , offspring of Moya , to rest in his sacred ground . The rogue is making a run at the debris . Moya pleads with you not to let her disperse Talyn 's remains ! Commencing attack . Here she comes , D 'Argo . Right where you want her . Good job , Aeryn . She 's veering away from Talyn and chasing you . All right . Let 's do it . Very effective . Did ya get ' em ? She 's gone ... . completely . Chi , they got her ! You ... know what this means ? It means we 're done . Talyn rests where he belongs . Scorpius has no ship . We 're all unhurt , healthy , and ... no one 's trying to kill us ! It means , finally we can go where we want . We can go home ! Home ! We 're going home ! I 'm going home ! Who are you , old woman ? It doesn 't matter who I am . But I know who you are . You made them come back and rescue our lifepod after the Command Carrier imploded . I 'm no longer a prisoner because of you . So , when the others got off , I stayed ... on Moya , to repay the debt . By messing ' with my mind . Oh , no ... No ! I would never leave this on boil for so long . Would you like - some ... - What did you do to me ? All we lie . The lies that spew outward do much less damage than the ones that stay hidden . When I was a kid ... I dreamed ... of outer space . And then I got here ... and I dream of Earth . Lately ... none of my dreams work . Do you know why ? Huh . Tryin ' to make it the way it was ... the way it ... never was . Did my herbs help you ? They stripped away the lies . But I ran from it . And I am ... so ... tired of running . Show me again . Forward is the truth . It 's the lies that restrain us ... May I cut in , son ? Everybody ? Everybody . I want to propose a toast to my son and my new daughter . You all know their incredible story ... the odds they had to beat . And the good fortune that brought ' em home safe and sound . So please join me in wishing the new , Mr. and Mrs. Crichton , All the best ... Get down ! - No , see the truth ... Everybody run ! See truth ! See truth ! See it . Confront your fear No , Aeryn . No , baby . You 're gonna be all right . You 're gonna be all right . Don 't you worry bout me . I 've never felt better . Well then , John ... Tell me ... What did you expect ? It 's a nightmare . What is ? My life ... My dreams . Earth and my friends . Uh ... I tried to merge the two . They are incompatible . Then choose one . I ... can 't go to Earth . And my friends are all leaving . You blame yourself . Dog with two bones . Unfamiliar . Dog ... animal ... it 's a pet . He has this bone ... it 's the most important thing in the world ... carries it everywhere he goes , and uh ... one day he goes down to the water and he sees another dog with a bone , reflected on the surface . It 's identical and he wants that bone too . So ... he opens his mouth to grab it ... and his bone falls in the water and it disappears . It 's gone . And he 's left standing there ... looking at himself ... and he has nothing . Is this dog ... smart enough to learn ? It 's too late . It is never ... If the dog ... could have had only one bone ... which would it have wanted ? I 'm coming with you . No . I 'm sorry . Well , you 're not leaving without me . What do you want ? You . I 'm afraid it 's not that easy for me , you see you died . I watched that happen and yet you 're still alive . I have to go . Then say good-bye . We don 't say good-byes . We do this time . You see , you leave , and then you come back and I-I can 't ... handle the in between , Aeryn . - Say good-bye . - Fine . - Good bye Crichton . John ! My name is John . " Good-bye , John , " to my face . Guarantee you won 't ... die in my arms again ! Guarantee you won 't die in mine ! I can ... by leaving ! Do you love John Crichton ? ! Not him not me . John Crichton . Yes . Then what does that taste like ? Yesterday . Well , nobody can compete with that . I am so much better dead . I can 't do this again . And I can 't let the one thing I love fly away in a crappy little ship ! You once said it was as if the fates meant for us to be together . And I believe that . Well , then , if it 's true , we will be together again . Running away is not fate , Aeryn . Running away is running away . Fine , if you want fate- - here , I 've-I 've got a fate . - Fate , here . - What ? Coin toss . What , like that side up , you stay ? Absolutely . Fate . Just make a frelling wormhole , and go home . There is no home ! There is no wormhole ! There 's only you . Aeryn ... anywhere in the universe . You pick the planet . It 's too late for that . It 's not too late . No . You 're not listening to me . It 's too late for me . You do this ... and we 'll never see each other again . Do you love Aeryn Sun ? Beyond hope . Then , don 't make me say good-bye and don 't make me stay . Anything positive I do with the rest of my life , will be because of you . Take care , my friend . You better not forget me . You better not ever forget that I love you . Of all the lesser species , I admit I 've grown to like yours the best . We 're in the hands of fate now . We have to trust in that . Fly safe . Good bye , John Crichton . Crichton ? Still alive ? Out of fuel ? Uh ... Yeah , Jool . I 'm ... almost out of fuel . Pilot . I 'm headin ' back . The human subconscious ... is a fascinating place . Malleable , permeable ... fallible . Harvey , you gotta get your nose outta the dictionary . Guess what I found there , John ? Go away . I don 't feel like talkin ' right now . I will honor your wishes , John . However , having chosen our partnership above all else , your well being is now irrevocably mine . My gift . Be forgiving ... Be kind ... Better angels . Her life . Her world . On her time . You will know ... Aeryn ... is ... with child . Aeryn ... Why didn 't you tell me ? Why didn 't you trust me ? Old Woman ! Pilot ... Patch me through to Aeryn . She is beyond our range , Commander . Get a fix on her position , we 're goin ' after her . Hold on a microt ! Damn it ! Just do it ! First we 'll go to my ... Obey his command , Pilot ... . Pilot , please . For the love of God , please . Uh ... I shall approximate Officer Sun 's vector and initiate chase upon your retrieval . Commander ... stay clear ! ... We 're being ... You have got to be kidding me . SUBTITES By Slay and Pcosmos

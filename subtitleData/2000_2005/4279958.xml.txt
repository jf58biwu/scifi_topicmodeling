 Previously on " The 4400 " . - Listen up , we 're DefCon 1 . - A comet cannot change course . - This one has . - Then it 's not a comet . We 're not sure what 's happened . Thousands of people have appeared . A telekinetic salesman , a clairvoyant eight-year-old and some kind of super-vigilante . They can 't hurt me , no one can . Those are only the ones we know about . Unless you can think of anyone else ? There 's nothing to tell . What 's going on between you two ? You 're my brother . She 's your girlfriend . It 's all good . Oh ... We 're not actually a couple . - So , it 's just you and the baby ? - No . It 'll be the three of us . - What did you do to Kyle ? - I didn 't do anything to him . Then can I go home ? With you ? I don 't like being here alone . You don 't like being alone either . They said draining the fluid might not be enough , more might build up . If it does , Kyle could suffer permanent brain damage . The time I lost is gone . I 'll never get it back , but my years in the dark didn 't kill me . And my work remains . And even though I might not understand what 's happening to me , I have faith in the final outcome . After all , I 'm doing what I was intended to do , becoming what I was meant to be . I look forward to corresponding with you again , I know it 's been a long time . I tell you this as a courtesy - you can observe my work , but there 's no point in trying to interfere with it . I 'm now in full command of my talents . I hope the world is ready . Despite protests , Homeland Security refuses to divulge the names or whereabouts of the 4400 living here in the US . Confirmed reports of unusual abilities have the public panicked . And yet this man sitting beside me says we have nothing to worry about . I 'm sure most of you recognise him even though he 's been away for the past 28 months . I 'm talking about Mr Jordan Collier , who recently breached the government 's wall of silence and chose to out himself as one of the notorious 4400 . Jordan ... Why ? Why now ? Why here ? - What 's your agenda ? - I have no agenda . But someone had to put a human face on the 4400 . We 've been demonised enough by people like you . If you 're implying this is a witch-hunt , I disagree . You 're not the one burnt at the stake . - Breakfast is ready . - Shouldn 't I be saying that to you ? Maia ! Thank you very much ! This beats a can of coke and a slice of cold pizza . - I 'll get better at being the grown-up . - It 's OK . I like being the grown-up . I think you 'll have a good time with Mrs Benke . I hear she 's a very cool babysitter . I talked to Mr Ryland about permission to get you enrolled in school . - That would be nice , right ? - Yeah , school might be fun . Diana ... You 're not going to like what 's in there . Oliver Knox disappeared August 22nd 1983 , five nights after the last body turned up . - He moved back when ? - Three weeks ago . - Nineteen days before the latest body . - It could be a coincidence . The letter seems genuine but the latest victim wasn 't a prostitute . - The others were . - Coincidence . That 's the kind of positive thinking we like to encourage . If it is Knox , we 've got a 4400 serial killer on our hands . If that 's not a worst-case scenario , it 'll do for one . It 's the kind of issue Barbara Yates lives for . - So we 're off to Friday Harbor . - Bring me back a t-shirt . Alex ... National Threat Assessment Command , NTAC . - You 're here about Knox ? - Got it . It 's a small town . Oliver reappeared after 21 years and he doesn 't look a day older . We connected the dots . Are you gonna take over my investigation ? We 'll be co-operating until we establish Knox 's guilt or innocence . I could use some fresh air . And some co-operation . His alibi 's airtight . We still want to talk to him . Anything else you can tell us ? You want to know about Knox ? When he was 15 , he was bow hunting with his cousin . There was an accident , Knox ended up with an arrow in his chest . His cousin panicked and ran . Knox woke up in a pool of blood , with an arrow in his chest . So he pulled it out and cauterised the wound ? Even better . He stood up and walked four miles into town , strolled into the emergency room and checked himself in . All this with an arrow in his chest . Years later , I asked him if it happened that way . He said every word was true . I told him , " That must have been the walk from hell . " " Not at all " , he said . " It was exhilarating . " He felt like he could have walked forever . That 's Oliver Knox . Mr Knox ... Mr Knox . We 've a few questions about the death of Theresa Baron . Sheriff Conrad call you or you jumped to the same conclusion ? Not a big jump . You were on the police radar back in ' 83 . Along with a number of other people . Did you know Ms Baron ? No . She was born after I was abducted . Look , I know how tempting the math is on this murder . I disappear in ' 83 , the killings stop . - Here I am , and the poor girl 's dead . - We noticed . In your shoes , I 'd probably want me to be guilty too . It would be so convenient , but ... I almost feel bad I can 't oblige you . I did not kill that woman . Listen , can I get you some water ? If we 're going to talk we might as well be civilised . No . We 've taken up enough of your time . Conrad told me about how you got shot in the chest that day . Jim does love to talk . You 'd like to see the arrow ? I have it inside . That won 't be necessary . How 's Kyle ? We don 't know yet . About last night ... - The kiss . - That . And other things . - We have a lot to talk about . - No , we don 't . Shawn . You have a gift . - Nikki . When did you get here ? - How 's Kyle ? Still in intensive care but Uncle Tommy says he 's stable . Guess whatever they 've been doing to him worked . For now , anyway . Listen , I 'm starving . You wanna come with us to the cafeteria ? Yeah . I 'll bring you a burrito . Start with something easy . - Tell me about your parents . - My parents ? They used to argue about money a lot . That was before they split up . - They divorced ? - Yeah , I was 14 . Do you remember how that made you feel ? Depressed . Angry , maybe . Why don 't you tell me about the rest of your family ? They 're gone . Got a few cousins outside of St Louis who remember me as a ... picture in an old photo album . My husband married another woman . My brother hates that I 'm back . What 's the point of this ? Look , you wanna help me ? Help me find a job . Tell me what to say when they ask me how old I am . Or about my work experience or how to explain that gap in my resume . Everyone says the world 's better , people don 't judge you by your skin . I 'm still being judged . You 're asking me about my relationship with my parents ? Let 's talk about this hostility that you 're manifesting towards me . Danny , you wanted to see me ? Thanks , Peter . - So this is where you work ? - Yeah . - What 's up ? - I want to talk to you about something . - Is it about Shawn ? - How did you know ? I 'm listening . He had a fight at school a few weeks ago . He might 've killed the guy but I stepped in . What did he do to him ? It sounds crazy but ... It was like Shawn was draining the life out of him , somehow . I 'm not the only one who saw it . What made you decide to tell me now ? Just thought you should know . Beautiful , aren 't they ? I wonder if that 's where we were . - What 's everybody doing here ? - What are you doing here ? I don 't know . I wanted to see it , where we came back . I figured it would be a good place to come and think , to clear my head . Most people come for the conversation . - There 's not a lot of that going on . - Give it time . Around 11 o 'clock , this place becomes one big group therapy session . I 'm sorry to interrupt but I just had to see this myself . My name 's Jordan Collier . Some of you may recognise me . If you do , you know I 'm one of the 4400 , just like you . I 'm impressed that you 've found each other . And I 'm glad that you 've come in support of each other . And ... I 'm cold ! And I have to guess that you guys are cold too . I suggest that we continue these get-togethers indoors . I have a place nearby . It 's warm , it 's spacious . I want to invite all of you to meet me there next Thursday afternoon . You listen to the news , you read the paper , you hear the talk . It seems like the entire world is turning against us . Well , what are we going to do about it ? Are we gonna give up ? Run and hide ? Maybe . Or maybe , just maybe , we build a world of our own . This is the spot where we found Theresa Baron 's body . - We went over everything pretty good . - Yeah , well ... We have the toys . We like to take them out of the box . The killer posed her after she was dead ? There should have been blood hand-prints all over . It rained that day . The scene was washed clean . But if he dragged her over here , he had to grab onto something . Tom . I 'll be damned . His name is Philip Lopez . He did 18 years for rape . He was paroled six months ago . His prints were found at the scene of Theresa Baron 's murder . Everyone set ? Go . Lopez ! Tom . The suicide note says he killed all nine women . Only his time away kept him from doing more . The dates makes sense ? Lopez worked as seasonal labour during the first round of killings . I guess we owe Oliver Knox an apology . Excuse me , can I get a cranberry juice and Seltzer ? And ... give me another of what he 's having . - Excuse me ? - Sorry , I ... I go to Florence in four days and I didn 't want to seem like a tourist . - Ice ? - A little . - I studied Italian in college . - Really ? " Beautiful as a sunset over Duomo . " - That is very good . You get an A Plus . - And you get a free round . - Felicia . Can I get a beer ? - Grazie . Need a refill , friend ? - Thanks . - Listen , I ... We don 't know each other but I 've something to show you . - So , what 's her name ? - I don 't know . But ... I can tell you something about her . Hello ? So sorry I 'm late ! Hey , Iris , how did we do today ? - I can 't come back here . - What ? Why ? That child . I 'm sorry . You 'll find someone . I told her we wouldn 't be seeing each other for a couple of weeks . Why did you tell her that ? Because she was gonna be called for jury duty . She thought I was kidding . A few hours later , her husband called . And she got a summons for jury duty ? Well , hey , come here . It 's OK , all right ? It 's OK . - What are you doing here so late ? - My mom said he was getting worse . The fluid 's building inside his skull again . Why did they take me and leave him like this ? We were both on the beach that night , I don 't understand . I wish I could remember something 'cause I keep thinking , I think it would help . Tom said you were here the night Kyle had that ... jump in his brain activity . He was getting better . And now he 's dying . Shawn , did you do something to him ? Shawn , tell me . Just talk to me . You know I didn 't do anything . I told Uncle Tommy . I told you , OK ? I gotta go . I wish we could talk to a doctor . And say what ? " My baby may be an alien and , by the way , I know what it 's thinking " ? That will just get me thrown right back in to quarantine . I was there today to register our address . Thanks , I can 't stand going back there . I ran into Gary Branscombe . He had the bed next to mine . He told me about Jordan Collier 's get-togethers . - He 's the hotel guy ? - Yeah , turns out he 's one of us . We should go . Richard , come on ! You can 't tell me teenagers didn 't make out in 1951 . - Yeah , in a parked car by the lake . - Oh , in a parked car by the lake ? That 's very cute . Let me tell you somethin ' about her ... Let me tell you somethin ' ... I can tell you somethin ' ... Let me tell you somethin ' ... Let me tell you somethin ' ... Are you crazy ? Get outta the road ! I killed them . I killed them all . - I killed them all . - Hands up ! Keep your hands up ! Gail Keating . She worked at a video store . They found her body in the park this morning . Her blood was all over him . He spoke for five minutes when we brought him in . Confessed to Gail 's death and the other nine murders . - Not a word since . - Lopez killed Theresa Baron . He said so in his suicide note , her shirt was in his apartment ... This morning , Charlie Staley confessed to the same murder . They both claim to be behind the original killings ? Yeah . Only Charlie 's 39 . He was five years old when the first death happened . We can eliminate Lopez as a suspect as well . - How d 'you figure that ? - Lopez 's prison records . He was left-handed . The autopsy reports show the Friday Harbor killer was right-handed . So Lopez kills one girl , Staley kills the other , and neither one committed the original crimes . Why would they confess to murders they couldn 't possibly have committed ? - The pieces don 't quite fit together . - Until you add Knox into the puzzle . He disappears , the killings stop . He came back , they started again . Let 's say Knox is involved somehow . That means what ? He 's forcing these men to do his murders for him ? Could be . The question is , how ? Why have more than one person admit the crimes ? One , we 'd stop digging . Two gets our attention . Maybe he can 't control everything . What if Knox can force people to kill ? But only by convincing them they really are the Friday Harbor killers ? In for one murder , in for them all . Good ! Hi , welcome . 1969 , huh ? The good news is , your bell-bottoms are back in style . - Hi . - Pleased to meet you . There 's this guy I was just talking to , he was gone for 40 years . He picked everything up without missing a beat . Then there 's me , I 'm gone for three years . - And it 's like my life 's fallen apart ... - I know , Shawn . Remember that most of us feel the same way you do . Some of us are more different than others , if you know what I mean . I 'm not sure I do . OK . I had this fight with a guy at school , I know it 's gonna sound crazy ... I really can 't hear the specifics right now . Not yet , anyway . I 've a lot of interviews over the next few weeks . I have to be able to deny what I need to . I know you 're feeling confused , and I can 't blame you . But it sounds to me like you 've been given a gift . That 's what Nikki called it . Well , Nikki 's right , whoever she is . And this gift , don 't let it scare you . - You will find the right way to use it . - OK . What can I do for you this afternoon , Lily ' 93 ? Don 't worry , it 's not a line . Though you 're the most attractive abductee I 've met all afternoon . - Jordan Collier . I 'm throwing this party . - Oh , nice to meet you . - Here you go . - Thank you . Do I detect a little romance brewing among the 4400 ? You have a good eye . I 'm happy you 're getting something positive out of all this . - You 're Jordan Collier . - Yes . See ? He 's not afraid of me . I 'm a little light-headed . It 's hot . I should sit down . - Why don 't I find you a seat ? - I 'll get some water . Thank you . Thank you . Do you want me to call a doctor ? No , I 'm not sick . It 'll pass . - Here you go . - That 's good . - If you 're not sick , then what 's ... ? - It 's just morning sickness . - You 're pregnant . - First trimester . Well , that explains it . Congratulations to both of you . Did I say something wrong ? - It 's a little more complicated ... - Richard 's not the father . I wasn 't pregnant when I was abducted but I was when I got back . Strange , huh ? Interesting , is more like it . It makes you wonder what they had in mind . Whoever took us , I mean . You haven 't told your counsellor about this , have you ? - We haven 't told anyone . - I 'd keep it that way for now . Look , how are you guys managing ? Have everything you need ? Everything except a job . I was a pilot in the air force , supposed to be drawing a pension . That hasn 't come through yet . I 've applied for flight instructor jobs , even for Seattle PD . Every time they find out I 'm one of the 4400 , the job suddenly goes away . Look . I may have something you 'd be interested in . It doesn 't involve flying but given your background in the military ... My foundation has an opening in the security department . - Foundation ? - For the 4400 . If you 're interested , come by tomorrow and see me . - I 'll be there . - Good . The rash of violence involving the 4400 continues . Sources tell us Homeland Security is investigating a possible connection between the Friday Harbor murders and an undisclosed returnee . That hypocritical , self-righteous , irresponsible bitch ... - I take it he doesn 't like her show . - He doesn 't like her . When we were with the FBI , she disclosed the name of a juror . Judge declared a mistrial , three years of work down the drain . She blindsided me once . That is not going to happen again . Tom Baldwin . Yes , Sheriff . I see . We 'll be there . That was Conrad . He got another letter . " I decide who lives and who dies . " My judgement is final and more verdicts are coming . " The date 's clipped from this morning 's paper . Couldn 't have been composed by Charlie Staley . Not from jail . This letter 's from the Friday Harbor killer ? It 's genuine . It describes wound patterns on the original victims . We kept that private . If you believe Knox is involved , why 's he out there walking around ? - Let 's pick him up , right now . - We can 't . We need to know exactly how he 's linked to these murders to bring him in . So what do we do ? Wait for another girl to turn up dead ? We can do better than that . - $ 27.75 , your change . - Thank you . - What 's this ? - Let me tell you something about her . Her name 's Felicia . She works over at the bar ... I expected a scolding on the phone . Maybe a tax audit . Not an invitation into the belly of the beast . Consider it a tribute to your bully pulpit . - I 'm flattered . - Don 't be . DC is calling for your head . I want you to dial back on the 4400 . Not gonna happen . I 'm a journalist , I answer to my viewers . Don 't hide behind freedom of the press . You shout " Fire ! " in a crowded theatre . And you 're gonna stop before the stampede begins . Yeah , you have a really strong face . Seriously , you should come on my show . You 're getting in the way of my job . If you continue to interfere with Homeland Security , tread lightly . And what are you gonna do ? Disappear me ? - I asked for your cooperation . - I 've chosen not to give it . Fair enough . Don 't forget to get your parking validated on the way out . This healthcare plan is incredible . The cover should provide for all your doctor 's visits and hospital care once the baby 's born . - Mr Collier , I don 't know what to say . - Say you 'll take the job ? I 'm sorry , I have to take this ... Len ? Good , good . The whole property ? Excellent . 26 million . Yes , I want you to close . Don 't worry about the board of directors . They voted me back in as CEO when I returned . I 'll handle them . Call me when it 's done . OK . Real estate deals . They 're never over till they 're over . So , are you going to come to work for me or not ? I can start tomorrow . Mr Ryland , Phil Gibson . This is an honour . Barbara will be very disappointed not to be here . - Actually , I prefer to speak to you . - Great . First , just let me say , sir , any information you give us about the 4400 will never be traced back to you . Glad to hear that . I 've something important to pass on . - Mind if I tape this ? - Quick and simple . I want Barbara Yates 's coverage of the 4400 to stop . - What do you mean ? - I mean it ends . She stops covering the story , period . Listen , Mr Ryland , Barbara has sole authority over her editorial content . Barbara says what Barbara wants . There 's nothing I can do about it . You 're her producer . Produce . You don 't know what it 's like in this business these days . - We 're not Walter Cronkite . - You want to talk about the old days ? In the old days , I would need a warrant to tap all your phones , to freeze all your assets , and to prevent you from ever being a passenger on any airline in the world . Like you say , it 's not the old days any more . You 've worked for Barbara Yates since the beginning . I 'm guessing you know where the bodies are buried . Draw me a map . My Dad will kick your ass if I come home smelling of beer . Evil cousin Shawn , corruptor of the innocent . Help ! Help me , Shawn ! Oh , my God ! Excuse me . I lost my dog . Can you help me find him ? - I haven 't seen him . - A wire-haired terrier named Boss . I haven 't seen him . Would you let me by ? This isn 't funny . - I 'll scream . - Yes , you will . Don 't move ! Felicia has to die ! She has to ! This man . What did he say to you , Mr Mitchell ? - You 've been following me ? - No . Actually , we were following Knox . I really like the composition of this shot , its nice , cosy symmetry . Now , what did he say to you ? You keep at him . We 'll bring in Knox , sit him next to his friend . See what they have to say to each other . - Knox ! Open up ! - Tom ! Knox ! - Are the police at the girl 's house ? - She refused an escort . Hello . Hello ? Excuse me . I lost my dog . Can you help me find him ? A wire-haired terrier named Boss . Somebody help me ! Let her go , Knox ! Knox ! Get away from her or I 'll shoot . - I think you broke my nose . - Stay down ! - You got me wrong . Let me tell you ... - Not a word , not a word . Goddamn serial killer . This guy murders eight people before he 's abducted . They send him back , he picks up where he left off . In ' 83 , Knox was your garden variety psychopath . They sent him back enhanced . Big difference . It makes whoever took him sound pretty nasty . They also sent back Shawn . And Maia . I know . For that , I 'd like to thank them . But it all seems so random . Maybe . Until you start to look at the bigger picture . Orson Bailey kills Adam Kensington . Revenge murder . Open and shut . Carl Morrissey 's a well-intentioned vigilante who ends up dead . Random . But we know Kensington 's company was perpetrating a massive fraud . We 've learned that since Morrissey 's death , his neighbours formed a committee protecting the park . Anyone starting to see a pattern ? What ? You 're talking about some kind of ripple effect ? Diana to the head of the class . The incidents themselves are just catalysts for change . - Positive change in these two cases . - Wait a minute . Whoever sent them back planned for these changes to take place ? Nothing positive in the Knox killing . Or maybe we haven 't seen the ripples yet . Excuse me . Hey ... I have something I wanna tell you . Hey ... I have something I wanna tell you ! Police won 't say who released this closely-guarded secret . A document containing the names and addresses of all the 4400 has appeared on the internet and is now posted on more than 20 sites . Authorities won 't confirm the leak but efforts to shut down the sites , with an emergency injunction , suggest the list is genuine . We 'll have more on this breaking story as it develops . What are you doing here , Shawn ? Kyle ? How long have I been in the dark ?

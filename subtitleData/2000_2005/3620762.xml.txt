 Dr Langenhahn , here 's the body . They weren 't kidding . They did the best they could , considering he was all mashed in with that garbage . - How mashed up is he ? - Basically , it 's hamburger . - And they want me to do what , exactly ? - Establish and confirm real fact of death . - l 'd say he 's dead . How about you ? - Yes , sir . Good. I 'm going home . Fax me the paperwork by 9 : 00 , I 'll sign it , everybody 's happy . Crying out loud . See this ? They left some garbage in with it . Looks kinda like a vertebra , only metallic . Note it on the report . Then fax me . Oh , God . I was hoping this was all a dream . When did the sun come up ? About six hours ago . - Somewhere back in North Carolina . - Where are we ? We just crossed into Georgia . A long way from home , Agent Scully . Under the circumstances ... Right . We can 't be too safe . Are you all right , Agent Reyes ? I should ask how you 're doing . You 're the one who 's gonna have this baby . That 's it , isn 't it ? What you 're really worried about ? Aside from whatever danger we 're in , where we 're going doesn 't sound like there 's all that much in the way of a facility . You know what I mean ? I 've never delivered a baby . I 've never had one . That makes us both beginners . This is a videograph from the DC morgue . - lt 's Billy Miles . - How can that be ? It can 't be. lt 's impossible . It can 't be , but it is , walking out of the morgue looking like a new man . His body was taken to the morgue in a box . Like I told you , you can 't stop him . You keep saying that , Krycek . You explain it to us , because I 'm having a hard time understanding it . Billy Miles was scraped out of a garbage truck. I saw him go in. I saw him come out . I don 't know if I can explain it in any technical sense , but that 's Billy Miles , without a doubt . Krycek , you can explain it . I told you he 's a human replacement . Some new kind of alien , created to aid in the repopulation of the planet . - Which Scully 's a threat to . - lf she has that baby . I don 't care who he is or what he 's made of . There 's no way he 's gonna find her . Maybe he 's not , but there are others out there just like him . And it 's only a matter of time before they will . Agent Doggett , see you a moment ? There 's someone here to see you . Name 's Knowle Rohrer . He says you know each other , and what he 's here for can 't wait . - End of the road . - Yeah , literally . If anybody finds us out here , it really will be a miracle . - Where exactly are we ? - Democrat Hot Springs . According to Agent Doggett , people came here for the waters , until the springs dried up . - He was born here . - Really ? Well , that 's comforting . I guess . - So where do you want to set up ? - Over here . Any particular reason ? I told you , I feel these energies about people and stuff and places . I found it works best to go with my instincts . I 'm getting a feeling myself . There 's no water from this rock . We 're gonna need some water and a place to boil it , along with sterile supplies and a clean place to do this delivery . I 'm a little stiff from the drive . OK . It 's not like you , Knowle , coming to see me when you make me work so hard to see you . This couldn 't wait . It 's about this thing you 're pursuing . - This thing ? - This man you 're after . I think you know what I 'm talking about . I think I 'm confused , Knowle , if it 's a man or if it 's a thing . This is military . Goes all the way to the top . I can 't overstate the sensitivity . There was a rumored program out of the Cold War , a plan to create a supersoldier . This kid was pretty damn super . Got up out of a gut bucket and hit the ground running . The kid wasn 't what I 'd call military material . In fact , they say he was an alien abductee . - You got lt half right . - Which half ? What you 're chasing is a prototype . And this so-called prototype , what is he after ? I think you know that too . He 's after your partner Scully . You may not be aware that she was part of a program . Six years ago , Agent Scully was taken in a military operation staged as an abduction . They put a chip in her neck to monitor her . It was also used to make her pregnant with the first organic version of that same supersoldier . What do you want from me ? Help us catch him so we can put him down , before he finds her . - You assume I know where she is . - Who does ? Your superior ? Whoever knows , his life is in danger too . I want you to know . Sit down , Krycek . Hey , what did I tell you ? Krycek . Krycek , hold the door . Hold the door , Krycek . Krycek . Mulder . You heard about this , right ? - How is he ? - He 's got a concussion . They 'll keep him here for observation . - Where were you when this happened ? - ln my office . Talking to somebody who warned me this might happen . Who ? Skinner could have been killed . He 's an old friend . He tells me stuff I 'm not supposed to know. I didn 't wanna believe it . - What did he tell you ? - Billy Miles isn 't what you think he is . He 's the product of a program to build a supersoldier . Scully 's in the program too . Her pregnancy was triggered by a chip they put in her neck . I want to know who the hell you 've been talking to . Who this trusted source of yours is who 's been spinning this fantasy . Knowle Rohrer . He 's in US intelligence . I don 't know more than that . Did he ever lie to you ? Give you bad information ? False leads ? - You have to think about it ? - He said Scully 's in danger . He wants to stop this guy . is that so different to what we 're saying ? You didn 't tell him where she is ? No . But I think the fact that I know will catch up with me , if AD Skinner 's any indication . You don 't tell anybody where she is . That 's the deal . Not even me . What if something happens to me ? This trusted source of yours told you he knows how to stop Billy Miles . Did he happen to tell you how he plans to do this ? - No . - Right . What do you say you and me go find out how trustworthy he really is ? Dana , come see what you think . My goodness . Look at this . Look at you . Wow . I found them folded up in a cabinet upstairs , and a nice porcelain basin and candles . - Do we have matches ? - l 've got a lighter . Yeah . Now all we need is some mood music , like whale song . Whale song ? Recordings of whales talking to each other , calling back and forth . I don 't know , it 's almost metaphysical . You 're looking at me like ... I probably sound like a goof . No , no , it 's not that. I was thinking that you reminded me of someone that I was close to . - My sister . - You 're not close to her still ? She was killed about five years ago in my home . It was a terrible time . It 's OK . I want to thank you . Thank you for putting this together . It 's not what I planned , but it 's very nice . - What ? - There 's someone out there . Stay here . Get out of the car. I 'm a federal agent . I don 't care who you are . Let 's start by putting that weapon away . Just point it down now . - l 'm a federal agent . - l heard you the first time . Just let me see some identification . Dana ? I 'm sure that this looks untoward , but my life is in danger . And my baby 's . There 's a man who 's pursuing us , and it is very important that he not find us here . We get hunters in here taking deer and game off-season . I 've heard every excuse in the book , but this one 's far too original . You don 't plan to have it here ? It 's not as crazy as it sounds . She 's a doctor . She can coach me . What if something goes wrong ? If you 're a doctor , you know the risks . - You 're unprepared here . - This man , he is extremely dangerous . I got a first-aid kit in my truck . It 's pretty basic , but better to have than not . I 'll be back with towels and the proper swaddling . Thank you . How is it that this friend of yours is so desperate for your help , and then , when we want to reach him , he 's nowhere to be found ? Maybe he got wind . Maybe he got spooked . I 'm beginning to think it makes no difference . You told me he told you he knew how to stop Billy Miles . - Are you telling me now you think he 's a liar ? - He is or he isn 't . - What difference does it make ? - lt doesn 't make any at all . Unless you wanna protect Scully and that baby . And then what ? How long can you keep this up ? How long until the next Billy Miles rears his head ? The next threat ? The next phantom ? Do you ever stop to ask yourself ? All the sacrifice , the blood spilled . You 've given nearly a decade of your life . Where the hell is it all gonna end ? I don 't know . Maybe it doesn 't . - Start the car . - Why ? Alex Krycekjust pulled in . What 's he doing here ? How did he get security clearance ? Do you recognize his passenger ? Yeah . It 's Knowle Rohrer . Thank you . I have to say , with everything I know you must be feeling , you look amazingly beautiful , Dana . And what about what you 're feeling ? Any vibrations , Agent Reyes ? - l don 't know . - What ? I don 't know if I 'm just being paranoid , but something feels off . We need some more water . Go back inside , Dana . Who is it ? Dana , it 's OK . He 's dead . - lt 's not OK . What do you mean ? - Exactly what I said . We 'll take care of this . - They said that he couldn 't be stopped . - Dana , he 's got no vitals . He 's lost too much blood . is this the man you 're afraid of ? How did he find you out here ? - l have to report this . - You can 't do that . - l don 't have any choice . - No , I mean I ... I just felt a contraction . Something 's happening . - Where 's he going ? - Not to see you , that 's for sure . Who the hell 's he going to see ? You go ahead. I got Krycek . Agent Doggett ? - What are you doing here ? - They let me out of hospital . What are you doing here ? I got Mulder in the parking garage watching Krycek . - What 's Krycek doing here ? - l 'm trying to figure that out . Yeah ? - He 's here with Agent Crane . - How the hell does he know Agent Crane ? Damn good question . He doesn 't . Been wondering who 's getting these guys past security ? Agent Crane is in on this with your friend , which means he 's in on it with Krycek . - l don 't understand. ln on what ? - Fooling us . into chasing after Billy Miles . into believing we could protect her . - Scully ? - Yes . They know where she is . - Only I know where she is . - You and Agent Reyes . You called her from a phone inside the fbi . Crane doesn 't have access to the communications system . - Skinner 's here with me . - Maybe this goes even higher . I gotta get to Scully . You gotta tell me where she is . We can nail these guys here and put an end to it . No . Get out of there . You got no guarantee that these guys aren 't alien replacements too . Northern Georgia . Democrat Hot Springs . Mulder . Get out of the car . Doesn 't seem fair now . Doesn 't seem right . Coming down to this . What do you know about fair or right ? You 're a coward . I could 've killed you so many times . You gotta know that . I 'm the one that kept you alive , praying you 'd win somehow . - Then there really is no God . - You think I 'm bad , that I 'm a killer . We wanted the same thing . That 's what you don 't understand . I wanted to stop them . All you wanted was to save your own ass . No. I tried to stop them . Tried to kill Scully 's baby to stop them . It 's too late . The tragedy is that you wouldn 't let it go . That 's why I have to do this . Because you know how deep it goes . Right into the fbi . You wanna kill me , Alex , kill me . Like you killed my father . Just don 't insult me trying to make me understand . It 's gonna take more bullets than you can ever fire to win this game . One bullet ... and I can give you a thousand lives . Shoot Mulder . I 'm going to go to the airport . I need that location from Agent Doggett . - Skinner , are you with me ? - Just go. I 'll get it . They 're two minutes apart now . It 's not going to be long . - How 's this ? - That 's great . Right there . Both of you . I 'm prepared to use force . Come on . Come on . Here you go . Thank you . - Move . - Agent Reyes ? - Move out of here . - What 's happening ? Who are you ? This baby will be born . Agent Reyes . The Blazer . Get Mulder on the phone . What 's happening ? - lt 's OK , Dana . - What ? No . It 's going to be OK . Get him off . - This is my baby . - You gotta push , Dana . Please don 't let them take it . - Come on , Dana . Push . - God ! - Please , don 't let this happen . - Dana , push . It 's mine . Hold on . Harder . Push , Dana . - Keep breathing , Dana . - Don 't let them take it . Push . Push , Dana , push . Down there . Get me down there . Scully . Where is she ? Where is she ? - Where is she ? Tell me where she is . - Mulder . - How is she ? - She 's inside . She needs to get to the hospital . I 'm to take this story seriously ? These incidents at the fbi ? This account of Agent Scully 's birth ? I 'm to submit this as quality investigative work , as representative of actual fact ? - l signed the report there , sir . - Yeah , I see it , John . And I see her signature here , too . On an X-File ? - l 'd like to know when you assigned yourself . - Agent Doggett assigned me , sir . Agent Doggett cannot assume the authority of this office . I assume it because this office is under investigation for the late-night meeting between you , Agent Crane and Knowle Rohrer . Both men were presumed dead , but are now missing . In actual fact . You investigate what I tell you . And you put me on the X-Files . That 's what I 'm investigating . Get some rest . - We didn 't hear you come in . - We brought gifts . - We wanted to ... - See it with your own eyes . It 's incredible , you arriving in time to save Scully , getting her to a hospital . How did you do it ? Agent Doggett said they never reached you with specific coordinates . There was a light. I followed it . Guess we got our next headline . How 's everybody doing ? We 're doing just fine . Hey , now . None of that . Hi . - What are you gonna call him ? - William . After your father . I don 't know . He 's got your coloring and your eyes . And he looks suspiciously like Assistant Director Skinner . I don 't understand , Mulder . They came to take him from us . Why they didn 't ... I don 't quite understand that either . Except that maybe he isn 't what they thought he was . That doesn 't make him any less of a miracle , though , does it ? From the moment I became pregnant , I feared the truth ... about how and why . And I know you feared it , too . I think what we feared were the possibilities . The truth , we both know . Which is what ? Visiontext Subtitles : Paul Allen US english

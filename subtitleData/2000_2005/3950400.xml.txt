 Hey , Challenger , where do you keep the extra gunpowder ? On the top shelf between the nitroglycerin and ... - What do you want gunpowder for ? - No reason . I don 't suppose you have any detonating caps down there , primer cord , laser igniters ? Laser igniters ! What on earth are you up to now ? I was just sort of thinking . The electric fence is pretty good . An electric fence in the middle of a jungle , made of ... copper mined from next to a T-Rex hatchery and ... powered by a handmade windmill is pretty good ? I guess , but I was thinking , if we added a minefield to ... A minefield ? In two days ' time we 'll be in the balloon flying home . Come on ! How many times have you guys tried to leave already ! Personally , I 've lost track . It 's become a way of life . How come you think you 're going to make it this time ? Young lady , let me give you a brief ... introduction to the basics of modern meteorology . George ! No time for lectures . The balloon will not load itself . Finn , I think what George was trying to explain is well , once a year , the winds that circle this plateau , they change direction . And once a year , when the skies are clear , well , we get to fly home . Try to fly home , you mean . I mean , why risk it ? Do you guys know how good you 've got it here ? I certainly do . Veronica , you know full well ... that the first thing we 'll do when we get back to London is ... mount a return expedition to the Plateau . We will not forget you . - Or Malone . - Or Summerlee . That 's what Malone said to me in his letter . No matter where our journeys take us , we 'll always be together , somehow . Okay . These guys are loading the balloon , and I don 't have anything to pack so ... let 's go check out that T-Rex hatchery ... before somebody starts crying . So , you and Malone really were ... I don 't know ... meant to be together ? It 's just what you said about living here . I didn 't know what I had until ... until you didn 't have it anymore . I told Ned we could be friends . What was I thinking ! ? If Malone were here right now , do you ... think he 'd still hop on that balloon and head back to London ? Well , he stayed behind the first time they tried to leave , but if he were still here , I think I 'd go with him , just for a visit . I get you . It 's like part of me wants to see what the world 's like ... in the XX century , you know , all the cities and the people ... before it all gets blown up in my time . But another part of me doesn 't want to leave . Especially you , Vee . I 'm going to miss you too , Finn . Do you think that makes us like sisters , maybe ? Yeah ! Who knows what it makes the other guys . Family . Finn 's family . I like the sound of that . You know everything about this place . What 's that ? I don 't know . I 've never seen anything like it . You think it 's like some kind of a mirage or something ? Challenger would love it . New Amazonia ? Oh , puke ! Vee , this is where I came from ! We 're in the future ? And we 're not alone ! - Over there ! - Run ! Don 't make me wait ! - Yahoo ! - Keep running , girls ! At the dawn of the last century A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out ... of the Lost World - What is that thing ? - Slaver 's car ! If they catch us they 'll take us to the oilfields ! Are we back ? We 're back ! Well , how are you , Arthur , how 's my favorite beetle today ? Good gravity ! You are putting on weight . No more tidbits for you , old son . Oh , I wouldn 't even bother with that . We 're considerably overweight as it is . I 'm sure we can find something less important to jettison , A dinosaur egg or two . An extra rifle perhaps . - Uh-huh ! - Oh ! Oh , Marguerite ! It 's not as though you have ... to smuggle them through customs ! You pack your valuables , I 'll pack mine . I take it you found the T-Rex hatchery . That was the easy part ! Challenger , there was this strange rippling thing , and ... for a couple of seconds , we were in New Amazonia . In the future you mean , in the year 2033 ? Sure looked like my time sounded like it , too . But you returned with no ill effects . Other than my ears are still ringing . I didn 't know automobiles could be so loud . This is most curious , I believe you experienced an aftershock ... a secondary tremor of the ... temporal dislocation created ... by my tele-tranportation machine ... when it took us all to Finn 's era . Oh , is that all . Another day , another mystery . At least the rubber tree grove is well away from the hatchery . Rubber tree grove ! The balloon is repaired ! We don 't need any more rubber ! No , no , no , Marguerite . Roxton 's right . We should have emergency supplies . Well , we don 't want to get off the ... plateau only to find ourselves stranded ... in the middle of the Amazonian rainforest now , do we ? Oh . Challenger , what are you feeding that bug ? Lead ? Two mysteries in one day ! England is going to seem quite dull when we get back . Do you think we 'll finally make it home this year ? I don 't know if I really want to , I 'm going to miss this place ... including the times we 've spent together . This stuff smells awful . Try not to get it on your hands , or you clothes for that matter . You 'll never get it off . Never ? Not without some serious scrubbing . Which , of course , I wouldn 't mind administering . Are you offering to launder my clothes for me ? Certainly . Anything to get you out of them . I think you 're getting rather too bold , Lord Roxton . Best keep your mind on the job at hand . There you go again . You , see it feels like you 're always pulling away from me . I 'm right here beside you . Oh come on , you can 't deny it . It 's the little things , like no time for late night coffee . Talking about trivia instead of addressing the issues . Not looking me in the eye during conversations like this . I am just preoccupied with all of the loose ends I 'll have ... to cope with if we do make it back to England . Well , we can deal with those together just as we 've ... supported one another here on the Plateau . My life back home is very complicated . Well , from what you 've told me , I 'm sure it is . That 's the difference , don 't you see ? You HAVE told me . I know quite a lot about your complicated life . Including the fact , you may be the reincarnation of a Druid priestess . I still don 't believe that one . Then how do you explain the birthmark of your shoulder blade ? It 's exactly the same as the one we found on that mummified body . Okay . You don 't need to remind me ! I was the one who found it . So ... if you don 't believe in coincidences , what rational explanation do you have for it ? Now you 're sounding like Challenger ! As convinced as he is ... that everything here has one simple explanation . Sounds reasonable to me . I think that the mysteries of this plateau ... are never-ending , and it would take a library full of books ... to explain them all . Easy enough to replace when I get back to London . This barometer ... could be helpful in determining altitude . - That 's odd . - What 's odd ? The air pressure was rising this morning as I fully expected . Rising . That 's a good thing ? Well , yes . That means the local winds will ... blow us away from the plateau . But now the pressure is dropping . And dropping is a bad thing . Yes . If the barometric pressure continues to drop , the winds will blow INTO the Plateau . So we won 't be flying out of here today . Well , scientific instruments ... can always give faulty readings , Finn . I 'll crosscheck it with the altimeter in the balloon . Sure . Why not ? How 's Veronica ? Mmmm , she 's all right . But that car that chased us really got to her . I 'm not surprised . She has never seen an automobile before . It 's got to be weird , I mean , growing up here , and knowing all about the outside world but ... never seeing it . Now I guess she never will . Vee told me that if Malone were still here , she 'd ... probably go back with him for a visit . I don 't think Veronica can leave the Plateau . Why not ? You saw what happened that day at her father 's grave . Veronica is next in line to succeed ... her mother as Protector of the Plateau ! But she doesn 't even know what that means ! You 're the science guy , do you really believe ... all this stuff about her mom being in someplace called Avalon ? Stranger things have happened . Especially here . Strange things and strange people . Are you sure we can carry all of that ? Unless you want to make two trips . I 'd rather not make any trips . Here ! Ready ? Whenever you are . What is that ? It 's New Amazonia ! The ugliest city I 've ever seen and never wanted to see again . Just like Veronica and Finn said . What was Challenger 's explanation for this ? Where did it go ? Back to wherever it came from , I hope . Now where are we ? The witch 's castle . Is it over ? That must have been some sort of optical illusion . That puts us in three different places at the same time . Let 's get back to the treehouse . Yeah ! If only you could hatch . Raptors at the London Zoo . Now there 's a recipe for disaster ! The barometric pressure is still falling . According to that , we should be in the middle of ... a brewing storm . But there 's not a breath of wind . The sky is ... Hello ! What a remarkable atmospheric anomaly . Perhaps it 's the same phenomenon that Veronica and Finn encountered . This is it ! I found it ! I found it ! Great Caesar 's ghost ! You are William Maple White ! Have we met ? In a manner of speaking , I watched you die before my eyes three years ago . So after you stumbled into that ... native village , my guide brought me to you . But you were delirious ... in the final throes of a massive infection ... brought on by what I subsequently recognized to ... be a wound caused by a Tyrannosaurus rex . You asked for your journals ... and whispered show them , and then you died . Yet here I am hale and hearty . Maybe you 're not who you say you are . It wouldn 't be the first time we 've met an imposter . Dr. White , what year do you think it is ? I don 't think I know : 1919 . It is in fact 1922 . Impossible ! Yet here you are , hale and hearty . Have you experienced any atmospheric ... phenomena optical distortions strange lights ? We 're in a rainforest , Challenger ! The light is never the same from one moment to the next . Dr. White , I believe ... you have passed through a temporal aftershock , resulting in a disturbance of time 's normal progression . You 're the one who sounds disturbed . Your discoveries are what brought me to this Plateau ! A home to extraordinary phenomena that ... would astound the rest of the world , and yet ... you yourself refuse to open your mind to its wonders . He 's not here for the wonders , Challenger . Marguerite told us why he 's here ... to settle a debt . What nonsense is that ? You are sadly misinformed . Then why did you come here ? This spot where we are , right here ... is the grand intersection of a vast ... network of earth energy lines . The exact center of the Plateau ! Dr. White , I have been mapping the ... Plateau since we arrived , and I can assure you , this treehouse is far from being its center . An admission which reveals exactly how little you know . I have live here for three years . Challenger , you yourself said that your ... new maps don 't match my old ones ... that some places seem to ... have shifted position . Well , that 's true . The topography of the Plateau isn 't exactly static . There 's no need for debate . Do you have a shovel ? Come , Marguerite , Not too much further ! Are you still going to miss this place ? This is getting worse and worse ! That 's Malone 's pyroglyph . That happened some months ago . Now which way to the treehouse ! That way ... I hope . Not funny , Roxton ! Observe the proof . These markers have been here for millennia . They form a circle around the center . So the Treehouse is the center of the Plateau . According to Dr. White 's map at least . A triangular stone with a spiral ... just like my mother 's pendant . - Can 't be a coincidence . - I don 't think it is . You say this is the grand intersection of all ... the Plateau 's energy lines . It 's not just the intersection . It 's the origin . It 's the source that fuels them all ! It 's what I 've been searching for . I didn 't read anything about this in your journal . How would you know what is or isn 't in my journal ? What if the treehouse isn 't where we left it ? Where else would it be ? Well , on a day like today , it could be just about anywhere ! Well , let 's not subject ourselves to paranoia just yet , Marguerite . Hold onto your hat here we go again . Oh , damn . Conquistadors ? No , it can 't be ! Not in this century . I mean , there haven 't been Conquistadors in South America ... for something like 300 years ! Tell that to them , Roxton . Roxton ! Capitan John Roxton . Major LORD John Roxton , actually . - Who are you ? - Ferdinand Perez . In the service of King Phillip II of Spain . And whatever title you may go by , your days of plunder on the Spanish Main are over . Throw down your weapons ... or die where you stand . - That 's not very friendly . - Silence , woman ! - You ... - Now , Marguerite . Allow me to defend your honor . Whoa , right on the button ! Get off ! Get off ! After them ! Get after them ! Go ! After them ! Dr. White ? Among the items in your pack are your journal book ... and a photographic plate of a pterodactyl . Please take them out , and let me show you my proof . I 've kept these with me always , your journal , and this photographic plate ... are what inspired me to come here . This is my writing my drawings ! - That 's impossible ! - Exact duplicates , right down to the last entry . Dr. White , I believe that you have come into our time less than a ... day before you were attacked and killed by that T-Rex in 1919 . But if you come back with us to London in the balloon , you will escaped your fate . That 's just the proof I need , that the future can be changed ! I can warn the world that the war will destroy it in the XXI century ! Billions of life will be saved and the world will be made whole ! And you , William Maple White , will be the man who made it all possible ! What madness are you talking about ? How can you know what will happen in the future ? Finn , that young woman with the crossbow . She was born and lived in the twenty-first century . Dr. White , I think it is time you read my journals . I think we 've lost them , John . Now do you mind telling me what that was all about ? Mistaken identity , I guess . Don 't give me that ! That man recognized you ! Don 't be ridiculous , Marguerite ! Your days of plunder are over , he said . I have no idea what he 's talking about . Yes , you do ! And since I am running for my life , with you , I think you owe me an explanation ! Oh , look how the tables can turn ! All right . Look , if we really are back in the sixteenth century ... that man was looking for my ancestor . Why ? Because Captain John Roxton made his fortune ... by relieving Spanish galleons of their Incan treasures whilst ... bound for Spain . - I don 't believe this . - Well , it 's true . And for his efforts on behalf of the British crown ... Queen Elizabeth the first made him a lord ... and gave him a parcel of land . The Roxton family estate at Avebury ? Yes . Well , does that satisfy your curiosity ? All this time I thought that your ancestor was a great statesman ! Well he was , after he served with the British Navy . He was a private ! He was a privateer in the commission of the Queen . A buccaneer by any other name is still a cut-throat , - peg-leg pirate ! - Marguerite , he didn 't have a ... peg-leg or a bloody parrot ! Not even an eye-patch ? No . Why , Lord John Roxton , I never would have suspected you had such a colorful past . Well , then , it looks like we have more in common ... than what you thought . Any more dark secrets you 'd like to share ? Keep searching , we must find them ! Family secrets will have to wait . All right , Marguerite , I 'll need a little extra firepower . What ? - Marguerite ? - Bring him to justice ! Roxton ! Druids . We have been searching for you , Morrighan . What ? The time has come for you to die . What foul thing is this ! ? Allow me to give you a practical demonstration . What do you think you 're doing ! ? Whoever you think I am , I can assure you ... you are quite mistaken ! You are a Druid priestess . Your name is Morrighan . You have done well to have eluded us for so long . - No , this can 't be true ! - Bochra 's reign is over . I 'm the leader of the Druids now ... - and I know what you 've done . - I haven 't done anything ! There is a storm approaching conjured ... by your dark powers . A storm you hope will destroy the world . What ? The only way to stop the storm is by killing you . - Take her ! - Oh ! Shall I end your life right here ? Splendid , you 're giving me a choice ? Where did you get these weapons ? You wouldn 't believe me if I told you . - Where is your ship ? - I don 't have a ship ! - We came here by balloon . - English dog ! Your ship is anchored somewhere on this river , and you are going to tell me where ! Look , I think you have me confused ... with a distant ancestor . There is no confusion . Seven days ago , off the coast of Venezuela , you plundered and sank two Spanish galleons ! Oh , I see . Then what am I doing here ? You put ashore to hide your stolen cargo . No ! that 's NOT what happened . Your ship was overloaded . You had no choice ! Captain John Roxton was a very capable seaman . That I do know . After giving you chaps the slip , - he made it safely back to England . - Lies ! This ring ! This ring belonged to the commander of the ship that you sunk ! You stole it from the Incas , my ancestors stole it from you . The Spanish steal from no one . You will die for this ! Vee ! Over there ! We 're still here ! If Marguerite and Roxton were caught in one of those . At least they 're together . This barometer is still falling . By all reasons , we should be in the middle of a raging storm . By all reasons . I 've just been reading your journals . There 's not an ounce of reason to them . Trickster gods , spirit rescues , disembodied demons , Winston Bloody Churchill ! You call yourself a man of science ! So you contend that in the two years you 've been searching this ... Plateau you never encountered phenomena that ... was inexplicable to customary science ? Dinosaurs can easily be explained . As for other oddities , all I 've heard is second-hand stories shared by natives . But those two outside ? Protector of the Plateau ... and a foundling from the future ! Huh ! There 's our storm . That 's not thunder . What is that thing ? The Flying Dutchman . So tell me , Dr. White ... how does your customary science explain this ? An airship caught in a storm , no more , no less . Now tell me , how do you explain this extraordinary disappearance ? That airship was here , one year ago . The atmospheric distortions have opened a window in time . Are you saying that 's how I came to be here ? If this is the center of the plateau , I believe it is acting like a magnet . As if all possible realities : past , present and future are being drawn to it ! But faster and closer than ever before . It 's as if the Plateau is folding in upon itself ! Another airship ? No ! Just Challenger 's storm . Damn you , Challenger ! The center of the Plateau is a source of power ... that could give humanity ultimate ... control over life and death ! But you ruined everything ! I have ! ? It 's that girl from the twenty-first century ! You plucked her out of the continuum , like ... like tugging on a loose thread , she 's not where or when she 's supposed ... to be , and so everything comes apart ! You have set in motion ... the imminent destruction of the Plateau ! No ! The facts are against you . Finn is from this Plateau . How can it be destroyed in our time ... when it still exists in the future ? You brought this on yourself and you bloody well deserve it ! But I don 't ! I 'm getting out of here . Don 't be a fool ! Where can you go ? I know the way off the Plateau . Veronica ! Finn ! Stop him ! You heard him , Doc . You 're not going anywhere . - You can stop me ! - Wanna bet ? No ! Finn ! That 's not what he meant ! I was only going to wing him . What happened ? He went back to his own time . Back to that fatal encounter with the T-Rex . Now the secret of how he got off the Plateau has died with him . My mother couldn 't escape her destiny either . Maybe no one can . Now what is it ? See how the compass needle is spinning ? I believe this is the reason ... those shimmering windows have yet to reach the treehouse . The electric fence creates a magnetic field which repels them . So we 're safe . Not at our present power levels . but if I can get another line to the windmill ... I can generate a magnetic field strong enough ... to disrupt those windows . And then we will be safe . What about Roxton and Marguerite ? All we can do is hope they will be ... returned to us from whatever time displacement they are in , just as you and Veronica were . So the only question now is , who goes with the second wire . What does this spiral remind you of ? A whirlpool , vortex , maelstrom . What do you think the connection is , between these markers , the tree , and the fact that my parents chose to build their house here . I know the spiral is a common enough motif ... in many cultures , Veronica . Including the Zanga . The Zanga believe that the world will end ... when everything is brought together and ... crushed in single spark . The world is ending ? Not for billions of years yet , Finn . It 's a quaint story , Veronica . But I can recount dozens more ... just like it from countries all over the world . Then maybe , just maybe , they all have some basis in truth ! What 's happened to Arthur ? He 's spun a cocoon ! Challenger , beetles don 't spin cocoons ! Then perhaps he 's not a beetle . You keep playing out the safety line ... as I make my way to the windmill . If I encounter anything unusual , I 'll give three sharp tugs , and you can pull me back . Challenger ... good luck ! Good luck to all of us . Challenger ! Pull him back ! Pull him back ! Challenger ! He 's gone . Challenger ! - We 've got to go after him . - No , I don 't think we can . Whatever it is , it 's all around us ! We 'd better stay inside the electric fence . Shouldn 't the fence be making some kind of a noise ? There 's no power ! Something must have happened to the windmill ! Then there 's nothing left to protect us . We have to look after ourselves now . What on earth ? Who are you ? I asked you a question ! Can you hear me ? What is the meaning of this ? I demand an explanation ! No ! Can 't you tell from the way I 'm ... dressed that I 'm from a different time and place ? If that is true , then how did you come to be here ? I don 't know ! Your birthmark tells me who you are . The sacrifice must commence immediately . The storm is quickly approaching . What storm ? There isn 't a cloud in the sky ! As is prophesied , it will be sudden , and without warning , but the storm will come . Proceed ! The scouting party should have returned by now . Where are they ? - Well , are we lost ? - Not lost . My men will find the passage . My friends and I , well , we 've been trying to find a way off this Plateau for ... - three years now . - Stop talking nonsense ! What year is this ? The year is , ah , 1580 . 1580 ! Oh , that 's too bad . It 's doubtful you 'll make it home in time for the great invasion . And what invasion is that , huh ? Well , eight years from now , your ... king is going to send a fleet of ships to conquer England . How glorious that would be , eh ? To crush you like the cucarachas that you are ! Yes . A sea battle ... to be remembered for centuries . The great Spanish Armada ... humiliated by a fleet half its size . You know knowing . Spain will never be defeated . Well , uh ... don 't say I didn 't warn you ! Got him , after him ! Got him , quickly ! After him ! This is everything they worked for ... we can 't just abandon it . Malone 's journals ? For Challenger , when he comes back . Where 's that coming from ? It 's a cone of light . Finn , it 's like a pyramid , like this ! What does it mean ? It 's a sign of the Protector , my mother 's sign . My sign ! Finn ! It 's my turn , my time ! Your time for what ? To save the Plateau . And our friends , if I can . Anytime you 're ready . Finn , we need to find the center . Arthur , stay ! The ... center of the treehouse ? Finn ! I know where it is ! Remember when we moved the furniture ? The furniture ! The marks that we found on the floor ! My mother put them there for me . She knew I 'd need them some day . So what 's next ? What 's happening ? I ... I don 't know ! Vee , I think you should get out of here ! I can 't ! This is where I 'm supposed to be . Well how do you know ! I mean , what you 're doing could kill you ! I ... I have to try ! Vee , what 's happening ? The pyramid of light ... and the storm of darkness . Veronica , don 't do this ! Veronica ! Finn ! There he is ! Not here . I got her ! All right , come with me he went this way . Come on , this way ! Move it ! move it ! All right ! Don 't let him get away ! Four left . I think I could be in a little bit of trouble here . This is where you die , you English pig ! More than a little bit of trouble . On my command , charge ! Marguerite . Wherever you are , may it be a better place than this . Come here ! Come on ! Your body will be sealed in this tomb , for all eternity . The place Roxton and I found the body , it 's not reincarnation at all ! That body was mine ! This ... will put an end to your dark powers . Killing me will not solve a thing . Great circle of life ! Let not this terrible storm devour us ! Take this dark soul . Send us back ... the shining wheel . Storms come and go all the time ! Bring back the light ! Roxton ! where are you ? Please talk to me . Are you capable of speech ? The year is 4666 . Who said that ? Are you not a man of science ? Are you not the greatest mind of the twentieth century ? Well I wouldn 't quite go that far . You would be if I had not intervened . Intervened ? What are you saying ? - What are you ? - Technology . We are now the dominant mind force on earth . Thinking machines ? No , I don 't believe it ! It is a better place now . A peaceful place . Humankind has finally found its calling . But if you , George Edward Challenger , are allowed to live , this natural evolution may not transpire . What ? Are you saying I can prevent this nightmare ? Icarus . Extract the cerebral cortex . We need to study it and learn . You can 't be serious ! What have they done to you ? You did it to yourselves . And we thank you . Mother ! I don 't know what I 'm supposed to do ! Help me , please ! I thought you 'd come to me ! I thought you 'd show me ! Mother ! Is this what I 'm supposed to do ? Am I saving the Plateau or destroying it ! ? Am I the Protector ! ? Not really , this is the end : (

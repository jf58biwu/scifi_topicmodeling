 Hmm . How about some flowers ? Too much . Oh , Mauser . Is there a problem with the power units ? I 'll check the main coupling . You let me worry about the coupling . You 're not wearing your flex armor . Too much armor . Not enough flex . Sarge , is this some kind of seduction process ? Or am I not interpreting the ritual correctly ? No , you got it . You know I 'm not programmed for sexual activity . Yeah . A frustrating little gap in your program that I 've been meaning to fix . That looks like a sub processor for my neural cybernetic matrix . It bypasses certain moral inhibitions that some genius locked into your neural matrix . It lets you get nasty . And you want me to be nasty ? Oh , yeah . But I won 't put this in you if you don 't want me to . I 'd never force you , Mauser . You may proceed if you like . I like . You may feel a slight tingling behind your eyes . Well ? The tingling is not behind my eyes . Mmm . Easy , fellow . Slow and steady wins the race . Hey . I said easy . Mauser ! I guess this wasn 't such a good idea . Hell . Mauser , it 's me . What the ... Hel ? Get out . Mauser 's gone crazy . Shield ! Mauser , voice command override ! 792 , shut down . Now ! Did we miss anything important ?

Don 't worry . We 'll find him , and I 'll fix it . He 's not a toaster , Sarge . He 's a member of our team . He 's a tool , like a defense gauntlet or a shield generator . If we can 't reprogram him to suit our needs , what the hell good is he ? I 'm pretty sure he wasn 't programmed to be a sex machine . No . He was originally programmed to kill people . Hold it right there . This is a secure level . You , keep moving . I said this area 's off limits . Who are you ? Security breached . Security breached . Security breached . Hel , can you hear me ? I read you , Voice . I have a fix on Mauser 's location . 500 meters below you . Jeez , it 's hot down here . I 've never been this deep before . Where is he going ? There . Throttle back . Well , he 's okay . Just conked out . They got lucky . He 's gone this way . I knew Mauser was pumped , but , man , what is he doing way down here ? If his Betrayer programming 's been reactivated , then he may have reverted to his original mission . Does anyone remember what his original mission was ? Voice , does Mauser know your location ? He has access to that information , yes . And is he moving toward your location ? Voice , this is not the time to protect your precious secrecy . Do you want our help or not ? Yes , Mauser is heading my way . He 's going after Voice . You have entered a restricted area . Leave at once . I repeat . You have entered a restricted area . Leave right now ! Mauser ! Mauser , this is your team leader . Command override . 792 , stand down ! Hel , you must destroy him . He 's not responding , Hel . Shoot . Mauser , please . Listen to Hel . Hel . Shoot him , Hel . Mauser , listen to me . Stand down . Sarge , no . Mauser 's going after Voice . We have to stop him . He may be just a tool to you , but he 's also a member of my team . If and when he 's to be terminated , I 'll be the one to do it . Mauser , don 't do it . Oh , is that ... Voice ? Voice ? I 'm here , Hel . What 's your status ? Edward ? I ... Darling . " Edward " ? " Darling " ? Voice and Mauser are an item ? She 's not Voice . S - She 's my wife , Cara . Your wife ? Edward . Is it you ? That neural bypass you ran on me , it allowed me to access core memories from before I was with the team . Memories of being a Betrayer . No . Yes . I 'm sorry , Sarge . Memories of being a man . And memories of you . For a long time they were lost , overwritten by new command protocols . Sarge opened my mind . It was like I couldn 't control myself . Nothing would stop me from coming back to you . He 's not who you think he is . He can 't be , can he ? You haven 't changed a bit . Not one bit in 22 years . I know what a Betrayer robot is . You think I didn 't fear the worst when Edward disappeared ? I also know a bit about cybernetic programming . Everything in his mind , his memories , his , his feelings , everything that he was is still there . Isn 't it ? Yes , Cara . It is . Honey - Edward ! Cleo , get Cara to safety . Come on . Oh , don 't do it , Mauser . No ! Thanks ! Ugh . Stop ! Finish your mission . Lead us to the Voice . Edward , don 't go ! No ! Where the hell did he come from ? I don 't know . But once Mauser went Betrayer on us , the Bailey network must have picked up on his signal . So now every Betrayer in the underground is gonna know where Voice lives ? Hel , you must stop Mauser . The situation has grown a bit more complicated , Voice . I don 't see it that way . If you won 't stop Mauser , I 'll send a team that will . I got a fix . Well , then , let 's go get him . I 'll do what I can to bring him back to you . Hel , Mauser must not find me . Mauser , last chance ! Stand down ! He 's giving us no choice . You take the Betrayer . I 'll take Mauser . You ready ? No . What ? Mauser 's not just a machine . He 's a member of our team , right ? Right . Hel , there 's no time . Take Mauser out now . Sarge . Mauser . It 's me , Sarge . You know who I am , Mauser . Think . Remember Hel and Cleo ? The team ? I know those memories are still there . You accessed them before . Hel , Sarge 's shield is failing . Shoot Mauser now . Just give her a few more seconds . Mauser , I put that chip in you so you could feel something . Sarge 's shield is gone . Shoot . I wanted you to feel something for me . But you felt something else . You remembered your wife . Remember , Mauser ? Remember Cara ? Come on . You said nothing would ever stop you from returning to her . Nothing . Hel , shoot . I 'm going to need a full neural diagnostic after this . This is starting to get confusing . I 'm sorry for messing around with your head like that . I had no right . You 're not a toaster . A what ? Hel , should you ? So this is Voice 's office . Oh , so close . Yet so far away . Hello ? What 's that ? Sarge ! Don 't you do that . You almost gave me a heart attack . Relax , Cleo . I remember it all now . We worked here together . It 's where we met . Yes . Our people tended these power reactors for generations . We passed down the knowledge to our children . We were going to have children . Hey . Hey , what is it ? 22 years . You have been gone for 22 years . I looked everywhere for you . I even tried to go to the surface . I waited . I prayed . I ... I have a family now . Two sons . They want to learn to run the reactors . Just like their mom and dad . I am so sorry . Don 't be sorry . It 's what we always wanted . Before I go , may I ? I need to wait outside . What you got there ? Oh , nothing . Creegan . Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries

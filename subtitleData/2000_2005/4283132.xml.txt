Cursed bacteria of Liberia . My own son suspended from boarding school . It 's not my fault dad . And you Cubert . I cloned you from one of my warts and I can send you straight back in there . Nuh-uh ! What 's going on ? Is this angry yelling or busted hearing aid yelling ? - I 'm afraid it 's both . - What ? Now hold on , everyone cool your Dacaries ! Let 's give the little vermin a chance to explain themselves . It was self defence Mom . Just look at the letter the Principal sent . We were in science class and we had just finished building a minature black hole . That was easy . Pretty scrawny black hole . It must be hungry . Tuh ! Black holes don 't need food . Neither do nerds ! My manwich ! That 's it Bret . You 've compressed our lunches to a singularity for the last time ! Salt him Dwight ! When I resolidify , I 'm gonna put you in a world of goop ! See ? That bully started it . We couldn 't fight back with brawn so we used our brains ! I 've warned you not to use those things ! Let 's see . We 've got our malt , our hops ... we just need a big disposable tub to mix it in . Now it needs to boil for a couple hours . Dwight , you remember the crew ? Crew , you remember Cubert ? Wonderful ! And I 'm sure you won 't mind being their legal guardians for a month ! If it isn 't my old friend stretchpants , No pants and Idiot ! We 're making beer ! I 'm the brewery . I heard alcohol makes you stupid . No I 'm ... doesn 't . Actually Dwight you 're right . Alcohol is very very bad ... for children . But once you turn 21 it becomes very very good ! So scram ! Aw man ! Hey Dad ! What useless contraption are you half-baking today ? Eh wha ? Oh ! This is my latest invention . A device that lets anyone sound exactly like me ! Good news everyone ! I 'm a horses butt ! I am ? That 's not good news at all you little ... Aargh ! What 's this device 's marketability ? Who 's the target consumer ? There is no target consumer ! Only targets . Targets that will tremble as their new master hands down edicts in my glorious booming voice ! Now quit pestering me you scoundrels ! Stamp it ... file it ... oh yes ! Send it overnight ! Can I collate that ? No ! Can I shred these contracts ? No ! Wow ! A powerstamper ! Now look at all the work I gotta do ! Mmm . The ingredients are cooked . And they 've picked up some of your natural robot flavourings . Time to add the yeast . Yeast ? You mean I 'll have a lifeform growing inside me ? It 's so beautiful . Talk to me . This is Professor Farnsworth . I have an important delivery for you and your dumb crew . You must deliver a pizza to Dogdoo 8 , a planet at the edge of the universe . Sorry I can 't come down to say goodbye , but I 'm busy inventing useless junk . And I smell bad . One Week Later . Hey ! If you were my kids you 'd get quite a talking to ... . from your father ... when he got home from the Senate . Oh bother , what have they done now ? Those pork dumplings sent us on a fake delivery . The address was on Dogdoo 8 but the universe ends right after Dogdoo 7 ! Childman , is this true ? Yeah , but why are you mad at us ? Your dummy brigade wasted a week on an obviously fake mission ! Plus , you 're making bootleg beer inside company property ! Lies ! Lies and slander ! Accusing gentle Bender of a misdeed ? That 's the last straw ! You boys have been underfoot long enough ! You jerked the words right outta my mouth . We 're their fathers and its high times we acted like it . Ooo hoo ! Here comes violence ! Get a job you lazy kids ! I guess if you want children beaten you have to do it yourself . Come on Dad , shuffle faster ! You don 't wanna miss the unveiling of our new company do you ? Company ? How cute ! What will you be pedalling ? Lemonade ? Shoe shines ? Cootie insurance ? Perhaps they 've constructed a teddybear hospital ! Actually , we 're starting a competing delivery company . Awesome Express . Welcome to the world of business ! Who 's going to use a delivery service with a kicked sign ? Nobody that 's who ! But we already have a client signed up ! We 're delivering the Daily Supernova . So your delivery company is just a cute harmless paper route ? Phew ! No . Its a serious business . Yes its a tremendous responsibility alright ! What if a paper were to land in a puddle ? Civilisation as we know it might get splashed ! Why do they always treat us like dumb kids ? We 're practically old enough to find the Fox Network infantile ! Ah we 'll show ' em . All Awesome Express needs is a sturdy interstellar delivery craft ! Voila ! You got a quarter ? Man , that ad said to allow 4 to 6 seconds for delivery . More like 7 ! I 'm really starting to swell up with beer . I must look ridiculous . No , you have a healthy glow . Oh my God ! I just felt it ferment ! Ooo ! Let me feel . Have you thought about what to name it ? I was thinking Benderbrau if it 's an ale , Botweiser if it 's a lager . I hope it 's a lager so I can take it to a ball game . Ooo ! I felt that one ! Uh , there 's a crack in the hull here . That could cause explosive decompression . Put a sticker on it . " Huile stupide - Pour robots idiots " Off on your first delivery eh ? You be careful my little tinkler . Remember we used to call you that huh ? Tinkler ? Gets moving ' ! Those newspapers won 'ts deliver themselveses ! Only the Sunday edition can dos that . Goodness there must be 50 papers in that bundle ! That 's a big number , 50 . Yeah , you 're an idiot ! 3 . 2 . 1 . All systems go . Blast off ! See you at din-din ! I 'm blowing you a kiss . Argh ! Take evasive action ! It 's closing in ! You can 't avoid it ! It 's a cheek-seeker . And ... gotcha ! Maple Craters Paperboys Of The Week Paperboys Win Award On Slow News Day Business is down . So I filed papers to have you all reclassified as slaves . Well , well , well . If it isn 't our little muchkin moguls ! What 's the trouble men ? Need some penny rolls for your profits ? Actually , thank 's to Dwight 's brilliant accounting and my unaccountable brilliance our paper route now has over a million customers ! We 're finally making more money than you guys Aren 't you impressed now Pops ? Aren 'tcha ? Aren 'tcha ? Uh , in a small way yes . But you still don 't have your own building , your own conference table or ... or one of those things ! Our Dads are never impressed , no matter what we do . Maybe we should start a fire . If we really want to impress them we 'll have to crush them with strategy ... Dwight Lightning ! Very well . But I get to name the next strategy . This week on The Real World : The Sun . Argh ! I 'm burining to death ! You know how much an apartment that big would cost on the Sun ? People , as you know our young sons have become great successes in the very same field as us . All right ! That 's great ! That 's good ! Naturally , we 're humiliated . That 's why we need you , our loyal crew , to make Planet Express 800 % more profitable . We 'll start by slashing salaries . And this time I mean really slash . Uh guys , I don 't know how to tell you this . So I 'll just let Fry blurt it out thoughtlessly . We don 't work for you anymore ! What ? Dwight and Cubert made us a better offer . We 're paperboys new . Incoming ! We got papers to stuff team ! Hup two hup two ! Yes sir ! On our way ! We 're on it Mr Farnsworth ! Folks , the situation is grim but we shall prevail , thanks to you , our crack team of loyal dregs ! I don 't even know who this guy is ! I 'm Scruffy , the janitor . Yes , of course you are . Now we 've got to buckle down and save Planet Express . I 'm on break . Sorry to interrupt this " whirlwind of activity " but we have an announcement . I direct your attention to these forms , which I 'm presently engaged in handing to you . Sweet guineapig of Winnipeg ! They 've taken over our company ! Balderdash ! I never agreed to that ! No . But you did declare yourself dead 3 years ago as a tax dodge . Tax dodge nothing ! You take one nap in a ditch in the park and they start declaring you this and that . Either way I technically inherit your building and your spaceship . Which mean Planet Express is now Awesome Express ! You rotten kids ! Will you be hiring ? No . You rotten kids ! There . One million papers . Folded and loaded ! Hey Leela , help me apply these flame decals I got in my cereal . They 'll make the ship go faster . And what 's your scientific basis for thinking that ? I 'm 12 . Did I ever tell you how I used to own that ship ? There but for the grace of God . Little brewsky don 't you leak . Daddy wants to drink for at least a week . Oh my God ! I think it 's time ! Hurry Leela , get some coasters and cold mugs . Push Bender push ! You 're doing great ! It feels like I 'm trying to push a water bed out of me . Almost there . Just 2 more bottles . Is it OK ? I can 't hear anything . It 's an ale ! 5 gallons , 6 ounces ! Hey , what 's goin ' on ? This is a delivery company not a delivery room ! We just busted our bums delivering a million newspapers and this is how you greet us ? With a bunch of frosty cold beers ? Hey wait a second . How did you deliver a million papers in one hour ? Uh ... we just did OK ? Cos we 're awesome ! Yeah ! Yeah awesome ! Hello Awesome Express , the rude , crude delivery dudes ! How may I direct your call ? ... What 's that ? ... You haven 't gotten your paper ? ... In how long ? ... Uh , might a homeless old man have a touch more beef bourguignon ? And another tequila slammer ? Please ? Don 't ya sweet talk me ya wrinkly old cusack ! Might I have one too wife ? Ah you 're both pathetic , being jealous of your own offspring . Now you should be happy they became successes , instead of following in your footstamps . Oh it 's true . But they grow up so fast . We just wanted a few more years of being better than them . They 're so stinking talented they don 't even need their fathers anymore . Dad ! We screwed up ! You did ? Tough luck suckers ! Please , help us Pops . We agreed to deliver way more papers than we can handle . But we couldn 't handle them so we started dumping the extras in a crater on the Moon . And now everyone 's yelling at us about our missing papers ! And now we don 't know what to do ! Why did you boys do all this ? We just wanted you to be proud of us . Proud of you ? You ruined us with sleazy business practices and a complete disregard for human decency . But , of course we 're proud of you . Damn right we are ! Now come on . Let 's go do a little Father / Son weaseling out of this . Good thing I had this net installed for catching giraffes OK boys , let me show you how a paper man does it . Au revoir ! Can I use the gun Dad ? Aw what kind of father would I be if I said no ? Only one house to go . We did it ! Yeah ! Run away ! That bully Bret Blob lives there ! He 's ugly , mean , stupid , stink , mucus ! And last week ... we sort of ... broke his window . Alright , alright . What do we do when we break somebody 's window ? Pay for it ? Heavens no ! We apologise ! With nice cheap words ! I thought I heard the doorbell but I see it was the dorkbell ! Man , we had it coming Bret ! Now now , no need to give us the business . We 'd like a word with you daddy . Whatever . Daaad ! Don 't worry boys . I 'm sure his father is a perfectly normal reasonable man . What the hell do you want ? Mr Blob , our sons have come to apologise for damaging your window . They 've learned their lesson and they want to make amends . Sorry sir . Yeah , sorry . You can shove your apology into the bottom of your one way digestive system . Now see here . We assured our sons that you 'd accept their apology . Aww . Tell you what . I 'll accept their apology when they kiss my ass ! Which I don 't have ! No one gives my son that option ! Bring it on Jello-pop ! Yeah go Dad ! Show ' em who 's boss ! Get ' em ... Pops ! That was incredible ! You are the bravest dads in the entire Trauma Centre ! You guys almost had ' im . Until ... he digested you . Aww , you 're good kids . If I could feel anything right now , it would be pride . I was wrong ! I can still feel pain ! He 's coming to finish the job . Someone toss me out the window ! No no wait . I ... I feel terrible about what happened . I 've just been under a lot of stress lately , down at the plant y 'know . They 're bringing in computers to " improve productivity " and , well , that 's no excuse for how I acted . But , the boy needs to see that real men can solve their disagreements with words not violence so uh ... if you 'll accept my apology then uh , I hope we can put this embarrassing incident behind us . I suppose ! Hey chumps ! I heard you were on the ass end of an ass kicking so I figured you could use a couple of these babys ! Oh why not ! Might as well live it up as long as I ' ve got this cast thing on me ! Uh , won 't join us Mr Blob ? Sounds like a plan ! This is what makes life worth clinging to . Three fathers , enjoying a day out with their sons . It would seem we 've taught our boys a lesson about life : Man or Blob , it 's whats inside that counts . Subtitles : Ninjaw P.B.

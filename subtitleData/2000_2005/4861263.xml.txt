 Nandy ! Nandy ! Get inside . Go . - We ain 't open for business . - Shut up , whore . You we don 't trade with at all , Rans Burgess . You 're no Ionger welcome . You 've been told that . I 've been told a great many things . I 'm here for what 's mine . Ain 't nothing here belongs to you . You don 't get gone , we 'II be well within our rights to drop you . only rights you got are the ones I give you . - Find the girl ! - She ain 't here . girl left this moon more than a month ago . It was you chased her off . [ WOMAN SCREAMING ] PetaIeen ! It 's a good thing you haven 't left with my baby . - This baby ain 't yours . - So you keep saying . If this DNA is a match with mine ... ... know I will be back for my baby . And if I have to , I 'II cut it out of you . AII right , now , it 'II all work out . - He 'II do it too . He 'II do what he says . - No , he won 't . We won 't allow it . WOMAN : How we gonna stop him ? - We 'II get help , that 's how . help ? There 's not a soul on this moon go up against Rans Burgess . WOMAN : She 's right . Ain 't nobody strong enough . And even if there was , who 'd help us ? INARA : Hi . [ SCREAMS ] Sorry . Didn 't mean to startle you . You didn 't . I was just- - [ YELLS ] That 's more like a , it 's a warrior-Iike , strikes fear into the hearts of ... . You know , not altogether wise , sneaking up on a fellow ... - ... when he 's handling his weapon . - Sure . I 've heard that said . But perhaps the dining area isn 't the place for this sort of thing . What ? It 's the only place with a table big enough . Of course . In that case , every weII-bred petty crook knows ... ... small , concealable weapons always go to the far left of the place setting . Got a distress call coming in . Some folks asking for help . really ? folks asking for help from us petty crooks . - WeII-- - I should take that right away . well , it 's for her . Huh ? The call 's for Inara . - I 'II take it in my shuttle . WASH : I 'II send it there . This distress wouldn 't happen to be ... ... taking place in someone 's pants , would it ? [ MIMICS GUNSHOT ] NAND Y : And I got word you were in the area . I 'm imposing , but I got no one else to ask . It sounds like something this crew can handle . I can 't guarantee they 'II handle it particularly well , but ... . - If they 've got guns and brains at all ... . - They 've got guns . Payment won ' t be a problem . We just ain ' t equipped for this . - Nandy , it 's gonna be all right . - The house would tell you not to come . I know they ordered you to shun me when I left . [ SPEAKS GALACTIC LANGUAGE ] I would have waived you long ago . It 's just ... . It doesn ' t matter . Who ' d have thought we 'd end up way out here ? Who 'd have thought ? - Let me know what your people say ? - Of course . NAND Y : I 'll wait to hear from you . [ SPEAKS GALACTIC LANGUAGE ] And you . [ BEEPS ] I suppose you heard most of that . only because I was eavesdropping . - Your friend sounds like she 's in trouble . INARA : She is . And there 's no authority on that moon she can go to . They 're totally alone . Some men might take advantage of that . One man . She 's looking for someone to come and explain things to him ? That 's essentially it , yes . A whole houseful of companions . How are they fixed for payment ? They 're not companions . They 're whores . MALCOLM : Thought you didn 't care for that word . It applies . They 're not registered with the guild . They 're- - - Independent ? INARA : Yes . If you agree to do this you 'II be compensated . I 'II see to it . - I 've put a little aside- - - Keep your money . I won 't be needing no payment . mal . Thank you . I 'II contact Nandy at once . But you will be paid . I feel it 's important that we keep ours ... ... strictly a business arrangement . - I 'II speak with the crew . INARA : Good . ZOE : Those who have a mind are welcome to join . Those who 'd just as soon stay on the ship can do that too . Don 't see the benefit , getting involved ... ... in a stranger 's troubles without an up-front price . These people need assistance . The benefit wouldn 't necessarily be for you . - That 's what I 'm saying . - No one 's gonna force you to go . As stated , this job is strictly speculative . Good . Don 't know these folks , don 't care to . - They 're whores . - I 'm in . Wash , plot a course . WASH : That 's the whorehouse ? - Yes . How come it looks like a frozen dinner pack ? solar sheeting . Cheap power . Hope the whores are prettier than the house . - Nandy , darling . NAND Y : It 's so good to see you . INARA : You look wonderful . NAND Y : You look exactly the same . - How do you do that out here ? MALCOLM : Sheer force of will . - This is malcolm reynolds . - I appreciate your coming . well , any friend of Inara 's is a strictly business-Iike relationship of mine . This is my first mate , Zoe . I 'II introduce you to the rest later . - Can I start getting sexed already ? - well , that one 's kind of horrific . INARA : Can we talk business ? - In here . The rest of you ... ... there 's food and some liquor at the sideboard . Make yourselves at home . Look , they got boy whores . Isn 't that thoughtful ? - I wonder if they service girl folk at all ? - Let 's not ask . Isn 't there a pregnant woman to examine ? SIMON : You 'd really lie with someone being paid for it ? well , it 's not Iike anyone else is lining up to , you know , examine me . Whoo ! My John Thomas is about to pop off and fly around ... ... there 's so much tasty in here ! would be you 'd get your most poetical about your pecker . - You 'd be the doctor ? - Yes . - This is PetaIeen . - Yes , sir . She 's feeling a might weak right now . - well , Iet 's get you lying down . - Now that 's a plan . - Shepherd ? - No , thank you . We were hoping we might have a prayer meeting . We ain 't had one in months , except what Emma here reads out on Sundays . The last shepherd to come by was springtime , he only read one passage . And he took it out in trade off both of us . Everyone 's got somebody . Wash , tell me I 'm pretty . Were I unwed , I would take you in a manly fashion . - Because I 'm pretty ? - Because you 're pretty . MALCOLM : I take it reason doesn 't enter into this . NAND Y : Not with Rans Burgess . The man is a taker . - You think the kid is his ? - I think it 's PetaIeen 's . But the blood test . well , he did favor PetaIeen pretty exclusively , but she had others . Fifty-fifty , not that it matters . The man ain 't fit to raise a cactus plant . His barren prairie shrew can 't bear him an heir ... ... so he takes it into his head to pull it out of us . Not gonna happen . - I see that 's the case . - And you see the way we live here . Go into town , it 's the same . Some places come up rustic because they ain 't got more than basics . Rans Burgess has money enough to build a city , a real community . Keeps people living like this so he can play cowboy ... ... be the one with the best toys . Turn this moon into a gorram theme park . Someone stands up to him ... . He means to burn me out . Yeah , he sounds like a fun guy . I 'd Iike to meet him . This won 't be solved with talk . When I 'm gonna fight a man , it helps to size him up . - well , he 'II be at the theater tonight . - And so will I. Inara . Think you can stoop to being on my arm ? will you wash it first ? [ SPEAKING IN GALACTIC LANGUAGE ] So I told the boy , " You take a clean woman 's virtue , you take the woman . And that 's for life ! " And the boy said his vows right then . Took very little persuading on my part . It 's nice to know there 's some places left where oId-fashioned ... ... values still mean a thing . - Isn 't that right , dear ? - Mm . - I don 't think I know you . - Name 's MaIcoIm , malcolm reynolds . And might I just say , she is quite a beauty . well , thank you . Ever had occasion to handle one of these , Mr. ReynoIds ? silk trigger , active return bolt laser . - It 's lighter than it looks . - Don 't let that fool you . Won 't find technology like that short of alliance . And even their issues don 't have the auto-target adjust . I had that crafted special . Didn 't think weapons such as this were generally legal . For a private owner . My husband makes a distinction between legality and morality , Mr. ReynoIds . - I 've said that myself . - Bending one unjust law is small ... ... when it comes to protecting one 's family . - I think I understand you . - And as you say , she is a beauty . She sure is . Of course , I was referring to the lady . Ma 'am . [ BEEPING ] Yes ? - well ? - well what ? You said you wanted to look him in the eye . You 've done that . - So , what 's the plan ? - We get back to Serenity ... ... and we get off this rock just as fast as we can . And there can be no mistake ? Good . - Rans ? - The DNA matches . The child is mine . We run . Math just don 't add up . Our weapon stores aren 't exactly overpowering ... ... and I don 't much like what we 'd be up against . Nothing worse than a monster who thinks he 's right with God . I turn Burgess away once and he 'II keep coming . Won 't stop till he gets what he thinks is his . - So we run . - I understand , Capt. ReynoIds . You have your people to think of , same as me . And this ain 't your fight . I don 't believe you do understand , Nandy . I said we run . " We . " My people , your people , and whatever bits of precious you got in this house ... ... you can 't bear to part with . We load up Serenity ... ... and we leave Burgess in the dust . It took me years to cut this piece of territory out of other men 's hands ... - ... to build this from nothing . - Nandy-- It 's who I am , and it 's my home . I 'm not going anywhere . He 'II kill you . He 'II kill every last one of them , it comes to that . - And he 'II sleep well that night . - Rans Burgess is just a man . And I won 't let any man take what 's mine . I doubt you 'd do different in my position . well , lady , I must say ... ... you 're my kind of stupid . hell , he ain 't expecting much of a fight . Might be we catch him with his drawers low . He 'II probably ride in by daylight . But I figure , three-point watch , say four-hour shift ... - ... just to be on the safe side . - Three-point , Four-hour ... - ... should do it . - I 'm fair handy with a hammer . That so , Shepherd ? Been following the footsteps of a carpenter some time now . I can do something about our fortifications . Okay , then . We start shooting ... ... he 'II most like try to burn us out , save sweat and bullets . - Nandy , what 's the water supply like ? - Underground well . Pump that draws it up 's antiquated , but don 't break down . KayIee , think you can swing an upgrade ? I 'II talk to Serenity , see what she 's got . - Good . We might- - - Starting ! - And that it is , but time- - - Dr . Tam ? Oh , it 's starting ! Okay ! Okay , it 's starting ! AII right . Everybody relax , be calm . Nobody panic ! Everything 's gonna be okay ! - I got this one , captain . - Thanks . Okay . Okay , then . Let 's get to work , people ! [ SCREAMING ] The girls and I have been talking , Shepherd . We 've been discussing what we 'd Iike said over us if we should fall . No . I only bury the dead , child . No one here 's gonna die . There 's people gonna die . And with people dying , comes guts and screaming . That can bring on screwed-up behavior , a person ain 't used to it . When the time comes , most important thing , keep your wits about you . clear ? AII right . These are my favorites . You 're to keep them coming . I shoot , I run out , you hand me the next biggest one , and so on . - Is there an understanding here ? - Yes . alrighty then , Iet 's get to work . AII I 'm saying is that we 're living in the rough and tumble ... - ... and don 't see that changing soon . - Nor do I. Not sure now is the best time to bring a tiny , helpless person into our lives . That excuse is getting a little worn , honey . It 's not an excuse , dear . It 's objective assessment . I can 't help that it stays relevant . I don 't give a good gorram about relevant , Wash . Or objective . And I ain 't so afraid of losing something that I ain 't gonna try to have it . You and I would make one beautiful baby . And I wanna meet that child one day . Period . [ GUN SHOOTS ] JAYNE : Y 'aII are pulling , not squeezing like I said . Next one don 't hit that board is giving up a special treat . That man 's gonna use up our credit before we 've earned it . After you 've saved our lives , you can do some chores maybe . - I 'm a fair hand with a mop . - So your legend tells . Truth is , I expected more of you to be taking payment in our trade . well , we 're not a conglomeration . Got a preacher , married fella , and the doctor ... ... well , he 'd have to relax for 30 seconds to get his play . That 'd be more or less a miracle . These are fetching pieces . Any of them work ? Don 't got many rounds for the chaplain there , but the rest 'II be of use . - This is my favorite . - What 's its history ? violence and crime , sad to say . - What about you ? - similar . No , I mean when are you planning to avail yourself of some of our trade ? - My girls is clean and kind-spirited . - well , I got the job on my mind . After , I 'm sure I 'II trade . They 're a fine bunch . You ain 't looked at one of them as long or loving as you looked at those pistols . You 're not sly , are you ? Because I got my boys . sly ? No . I lean toward women folk . Just , one thing at a time . Never liked complications . Oh , I 'm certain of that . - Something to be smiling at ? - I trained as a companion , remember ? - I read people pretty well . - well , that 's nice for you . NAND Y : She 's a hell of a woman , ain 't she ? Inara . Yeah , she 's a cherry blossom , no denying . Expect you know her better , coming up together and all . Imagine I do . She ever tell you why she left SoonaI ? - Never asked . NAND Y : Yes , you did . And I don 't know my own self . I was gone long before . And I 'II tell you , it was a shock , her leaving . She was special . There 's 40 women in House Madrassa , and you 'd pick her out in a second . could 've been House Priestess , few years ' time . - Is that right ? - Had her eyes on it too . Very focused . She 's like you , more than a little . And how exactly is that ? She hates complications . They do crop up though , don 't they ? Such is life . [ SCREAMING ] You 're not completely dilated yet . Don 't try to force it , the contractions are still preliminary . - What 's he saying ? - It 's gonna be a little while , sweetie . But it hurts ! This child wants to be born , I know it ! Can you get the green vial from my bag ? We can dull the pain some . How many babies have you actually delivered ? As a primary , this 'II be the first . You ? - My first too . - Mine too . - It 's gonna be a Iong night . - You 'II do great , doctor . Who do you think is in there ? It was the dulcimer . The dulcimer drove you out of SoonaI ? Did you kill a dulcimer in a terrible passion ? actually , yes . And now that dulcimer 's family is out to get even , I get it . I was at practice . You never stop practicing , you know , not a true companion . Some baroque piece , and the instructor keeps saying : " You 're playing it , not feeling it . " And the fifth time he said it , I took the damn thing and smashed it . And that 's when it occurred to me that a companion 's life ... ... might be a little too constricting . So I trucked out to the border , learned to say " ain 't . " Came to find work . Found this place . It 's a nice place . It was a dung-heap run by a pig who had half the girls strung-out on drops . There 's no guild out here . They let men run the houses , and they don 't ask for references . We didn 't get along . And where 's he at now ? Let 's just say he ain 't playing the dulcimer anymore either . You are a remarkable woman . If you don 't mind my saying . well , as long as it 's you saying it and not my fine rice wine . It takes more than a few drinks to render my judgment blurry . What about you ? - Am I getting any prettier ? - By the minute . I should make sure everyone 's ready for- - Everyone 's asleep . well , there 's them that can 't ... ... night before a fight . Can you ? - What ? - sleep . Listen , Nandy , I have a confession to make . Maybe I should get the Shepherd . well , I ain 't sinned yet . And I 'd feel a little more than awkward if he were here when I did . You expect to accomplish something sinful then , do you ? If I 'm overstepping my bounds , Iet me know . [ SPEAKS GALACTIC LANGUAGE ] malcolm , I 've been waiting for you to kiss me since I showed you my guns . You okay with this ? I 'm just waiting to see if I pass out . Long story . - I want you to bed me . - I guess I mean to . I ain 't her . only people in this room are you and me . So my child ... ... how long has it been since your last confession ? - Longer than I care to say . - You remember where everything goes ? Let 's just say I plan to take it real slow . So the whore 's got herself a champion , has she ? - This great man got a name ? - ReynoIds . malcolm reynolds . Yes , I 've met the man . - How many has he got with him ? - Just a few . And only two real fighters besides himself . But they got the girls stirring for a battle . I certainly wasn 't expecting a battle . Seems the Heart of gold 's got itself a few mercenaries . Guess we best call the whole thing off . [ MEN CHATTERING ] Earned yourself quite a bag of silver , little kitten . But I got a few more chores in mind before you get it . I 'm ready . Now , Shahri here ... ... she understands a whore 's place , don 't she ? But Nandy and those others , they spit on our town . They 've no respect for the sanctity of fatherhood or decency or family ! They have my child , held hostage to their decadent ways , and that I will not abide ! We will show them what power is ! We will show them what their position in this town is ! Let us all remember , right here and now , what a woman is to a man ! [ MEN CHEERING ] Get on your knees . - well . - I just had to ... ... tell Nandy about ... . About time to ... . - Big fight today . - MaI , please . No , well , I , no ... . You know , I was up , I got- - So you took to bed with Nandy . I 'm glad . - glad ? - Yes . She 's a dear friend , and probably in need of comfort now . well ... . One of the virtues of not being puritanical about sex ... ... is not feeling embarrassed afterwards . You should look into it . well , I just didn 't want you thinking ... ... that I was taking advantage of your friend . She 's well worth taking advantage of . I sincerely hope you did . So you 're okay . well , yeah , why wouldn 't you be ? I wouldn 't say I 'm entirely okay . I 'm a little appalled at her taste . MALCOLM : Wash , you there yet ? AII but . - Nice day for a last stand , eh ? MALCOLM : Nope . plan to make a few stands after this . Just hoping for air support from your quarter . couple of Iow fIyovers , engines tipped earthward at fuII-bIast . should give our guests something other than killing you to think about . MALCOLM : What I like to hear . Out . malcolm seem a little funny to you at breakfast this morning ? Come on , KayIee . We all know I 'm the funny one . You ladies and gentlemen all locked and loaded ? - Yes , sir . - Good . Remember ... ... shoot the man , not the horse . Dead horse is cover . Live horse , pile of panic . JAYNE : Now , girl , that is just plain dirty . You are aware your radio 's transmitting . Because I don ' t feel particularly girlish or dirty at the moment . Yeah , just up here waiting , captain . Ready , 1 00 percent . MALCOLM : Better be . You 're stronger than this thing . I can feel it in your grip . PetaIeen , look at me . This is just a moment in time . Step aside and let it happen . - How is she , doctor ? - She 's at 1 0 centimeters . Not long now . NAND Y : Inara , I thought it was just him that ... . Nandy , believe me , I 'II be fine . MALCOLM : Morning . - How are you doing ? - A might tense . I 'd Iike you on the balcony with me . See everyone from there- - - You didn 't give me the whole truth . - About what ? About her feelings for you . - I really don 't know- - JAYNE : Looks like imminent violence ! Zoe , Jayne , you seeing this ? JAYNE : Gotta be 30 men out there . ZOE : Confirm that . Plus a mounted gun on that hovercraft . JAYNE : What 's that you said about running for it ? Okay , folks ! We got no shortage of ugly riding in on us . But that don 't change the plan . Anybody goes down , drag them to the back and get back to shooting . only way to help them 's to finish this . MALCOLM : Wash , we 'll be trading injuries in under two minutes . I 'd like my sky a bit less empty . WASH : Copy that , mai . We- - [ GUN SHOOTING ] Open her up ! Cover ! Jayne , I do believe that 's our first hurdle . You might- - I think I might , captain . Fire ! What have I done ? Go ! MALCOLM : Wash ! Where the hell is my spaceship ? Rotten Iasers ! Book ! Zoe ! Second hurdle ! That 's it , PetaIeen . One more push . That 's the shoulders ! Good ! Jayne ? I lost visual on Burgess ! JAYNE : Same here . [ ENGINE WHINES DOWN ] Take to right ! Whoo-hoo ! MAN : Hey ! There he is ! Get him ! Come on , Iet 's get him ! [ LAUGHS ] [ BANGING ON DOOR ] Try the other side ! Got you ! [ SPEAKS GALACTIC LANGUAGE ] MAN : Open this door ! Nobody 's going ... ... anywhere. - It 's- - - It 's a boy . healthy . Good morning , PetaIeen . How 's my boy ? [ BABY CRYING ] [ GUNS SHOOTING ] PETALEEN : No ! Rans . Most of your men are either dead , dying or run off . That don 't matter none . I got what I came here for . - Ain 't leaving here with it . - This is my blood , woman ! No ! This is your blood ! Now you hand that child over nice and slow ... ... or I 'II spill more than you can spare . [ BEEPING ] - You 're gonna pay for what you 've took . - She was just a whore ! PetaIeen ! You bring my baby out right now ! You hear me ? I wanna see my son ! Rans , this is Jonah . Jonah , say hi to your daddy . Say goodbye to your daddy , Jonah . Go on ! Go on home ! You go with them . [ WOMAN SINGING ] I think those girls 'II do all right . She taught them well . Yeah . I 'm glad you were with her , her last night . - I am . - Yeah , well , I ain 't . hell , I wish I never met her . Then I wouldn 't have failed her . That wasn 't the way of it . That 's a kindness . But nothing you say will convince me different . well , I 'm still glad . So you weren 't before ? Inara . I ain 't looking for anything from you . I 'm just ... . Just feeling kind of truthsome right now . And , uh ... . And life 's just too damn short for ifs and maybes . I Iearned something from Nandy . Not just from what happened , but from her . The family she made ... ... the strength of her love for them , it 's what kept them together . When you live ... ... with that kind of strength ... ... you get tied to it . You can 't break away . And you never want to . There 's something ... . There 's something I should have done a Iong while ago . And I 'm sorry ... ... for both of us , that it took me this long . I 'm leaving . subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH SDH ]

 After fifty years of bitter warfare the Eastern Federation has beaten Europa 's armies and taken control of the Eurasian continent . But pockets of resistance fighting the oppressive new regime , remain in Eurasian Zone Seven . The military mobilizes once again . Again , families must lose their sons . - C A S S H E R N - ... That I , today , on this meeting of the Health Department of the Glorious Asian Federate Republic ... may present the findings of my research to you is truly a great honour . Gentlemen , as you know , we 've beaten Eurasia and brought it under control . But the speed of our victory mustn 't stop us looking within . The Public Health issue is in crisis . Radioactivity ... industrial waste ... chemical weapons have poisoned us . More than 60 % of all our citizens suffer from these life-threatening diseases and a threat to our future . Genetic mutation rate has risen to a hopeless level Already our current medical technology fails to offer treatment . Allow me to present my findings . These are " neo-cells " , the fruit of my years of study . I found them in the genome of a primitive ethnic group ( ¡ ÅØèÁªÒµÔ ¾ Ñ ¹ ¸ Øì ) . They can be converted into any cell to regenerate human tissue . All of the internal organs , nerves , bone , skin , hair ... everything can be cultured and harvested at our convenience . Simply put : Spare parts for the human machine . With no risk of tissue rejection the medical technology of our dreams is finally at hand . Can we use it now ? With funding , it 's a matter of time . Our clone work is years ahead of you ! It 's just a theory ! Father , must you listen further ? Yes , it 's theoretical but if I get funding and the facilities I need , we can save our people . Think of your children . your parents ... and your wives . Luna ... When the war ends , let 's get married . Sure . Is this what we fought for ? Fifty years of struggle to end up too exhausted to rebuild our society ? I read your paper . " Human Regeneration Technology " A dream come true if it 's possible . It 's definitely possible . If you can do more research , right ?

All you think about is yourselves . How dare you ! as I said , you only care about your own ass . Even for the general 's son , this is unforgivable . Our nation faces the Neo-Sapien threat yet your only worry are your health and power ? That 's unforgivable . Son . You know this is treason ? Of course . The Eastern Federation is now mine . Sorry . The era of brain-dead idiots is over . Mikio ! Satisfied , now ? Commander Kamijo . Let me introduce Professor Azuma . Father of the Neo-Sapiens ? Why did you lie to him ? That 's strange . I thought you 'd be pleased . I didn 't create them . I don 't know how they came to life . Doctor ... Shall I tell them that you came here but you have no answers ? They grow stronger by the day .

You 're still human , aren 't you ? warm and kind human . I 'm no longer human . But ... You 're all I 've got . Tetsuya . Luna ? You mustn 't die . You have to live ! Dear countrymen . I have sad news . Several days ago , my beloved Father , was injured in a terrorist attack . Thank fully his life isn 't in danger but he can 't fulfill his normal duties . Yesterday , the cabinet appointed me to continue to work in his place . His name 's Flender . Doesn 't normally like strangers . It 's contamination . I can only do basic treatment . Sit down . It 's not much but take it all . We must build the ideal , the most humane society the world has ever seen . I hope we get it right this time . What were you doing out there ? The pollution 's so bad no-one risks it . Unless they 're on the run . What 's your name ? It 's Tetsuya . Tetsuya , huh ? I had a son your age . There was a lot of killing ... And a lot of people are taken away and never returned . Practically nothing left . Doctor ... What now ? Don 't trust outsiders ! It 's dangerous . What is ? He may be a spy . That nonsense , again ... Tetsuya , once upon a time , we believed in " Casshern " , a guardian spirit . Maybe that 's why we lived in peace and prospered for many years . But one day that all changed . A border disputes ( ¤ ÇÒÁ ¢ Ñ ´ áÂé § µÒÁªÒÂá ´ ¹ ) with our neighbors . Some senseless fighting . Fear and paranoia ruled our every move . We forgot how to trust people . ¨ Ùèâ ¨ Á " ÃÐà · Èà ¾ × èÍ ¹ ºéÒ ¹ ã ¹ ¤ ÃÒº ¢ éÍÍéÒ § " self-defense " . I guess Casshern gave up on us . Then we were invaded . Humans ... They 're humans , aren 't they ! Let 's go . Stop ! Why attack these people ? We can not let them get away The war should be over now . No , not yet ! There are terrorists everywhere . These people aren 't terrorists . I don 't give a damn . I just follow orders . I don 't know whether I should be killed or not As you heard , I was once one of them . We robbed you of everything . Can you save my people ? Is that him ? It 's fair now so it seems Luna ! Think you can escape ? Luna ! Open up ! Now ... I kill ... every single one of you . Flight 18 request permission to dock . Permission granted . Promise me one thing . If you win ... you 'll help these people . Fair enough . My name is Barashin . My name is .. Casshern ! Our strong nation forged through pain inspires and protects . Long shall she remain . Then will come wisdom and deep , silent faith . May the dreams of our fathers flourish by our glad sacrifice . Rejoice in our duty . 'Tis all that need suffice . My dear countrymen , That 's correct . Get ready as soon as you can . Professor 's bringing new samples . Are my neo-cells ready , yet ? General ... We are facing a great challenge ... We fight Neo-Sapiens , we fight terrorists . You sacrifice sons , brothers ... your pain is beyond measure . But I too , understand your pain . Many years ago ... My own mother was another victim . Taken by Zone Seven terrorists . She was tortured and then killed . because their demands were not granted but in war people die You 've no right to be alive ! Because of you assholes ... My own family is dead . If you want to change the world , some sacrifices have to be made and in return mankind will be guided by Heaven My daughter 's ... same pain taste it ! I didn 't fight it . I gave myself up to the pain . I became a better soldier , a better person . In the cause of honor and justice , Everyone ! now look each other straight in the eyes and let 's reconsider ... WHO is the true enemy ! whom we have fought until now I see it now ... At last , I see it too . That 's what she meant . We must prepare for the struggle against this incredible evil and remember the dream of our new nation . It 's okay , now . Forget it . All forgiven . I hope ... you 're at peace now . Didn 't we win the war ? Why are our soldiers still dying ? Amid the rubble and the funerals ... the seeds have been sown of our final victory . Where might you be going ? It 's all over . I 'll decide that . Experiment on the Neo-Sapiens , you 're nearly there . Study the lightning ... Don 't forget our dream . What 's going on ? What are you doing ? A nice naive girl like you wouldn 't understand but for us commoners this is the only way we can be . Right , Professor ? There 's no going back . This is the place of my birth . I should call you ' Father ' . But my hatred is as deep as a child 's love for its parents even though this hatred consumes me from within and might kill me I can never let it go ! Because ... I was born in hatred raised through hatred and this hatred is human ! You had another son , didn 't you Tetsuya , born of the gentle Midori . But today , Tetsuya ... has been reborn with a new destiny ... as my brother . Let 's hear the truth . If I can just ... get in here ... ¹ èÒ ¢ Ñ ¹ ¹ Ñ ¡ Commander ...

You can not come back here anymore ! I don 't want to go back and work for such a pathetic man like you , father ! Mother ... She 's sleeping . What did you do to her ? What !

A paradise . You kill others with the same dream . Did a single one of them ever listen to us ? Did anyone think to help us ? To listen to our plea for life ? Only Midori . The only one . You kidnapped her . No ! Midori came and helped us . I don 't believe you . What are you fighting for ? If you kill us , will it be over ? Will that bring forever peace and simplicity ? Can man live like that ? You , not even human yourself stop dreaming . If man doesn 't change , there 'll be no end . Hasn 't human history and religion already proven it ! Can you tell between good and evil ? Join with me . Let 's make a new world . You and me are the only ones left from our kind Don 't forget that ! you 're not human either . Mother ... Was I wrong ? Did I fight just not to regret myself anymore ? I only thought that my fighting could end this tragedy ... But wasn 't that from the beginning just to satisfy myself ? Like he said ... I don 't know who 's right and who 's wrong It could be just my hatred ... but doesn 't the other do it too ... Do you think so ? I can 't move ... Tetsuya ... Nobody is always right , and nobody is always wrong . We will have to find a way to live with each other , together Don 't give up . End the fighting . I still don 't see it . I didn 't see what you were talking about So I must still be alive ... If this is living ... What have you done ? What did you do ! We did nothing . I understand . But hatred just brings more hatred . Isn 't that really sad ? You didn 't come to this world ... to hate people All the people who have died till now don 't want anymore hatred How can you be so compassionate to these people ? You too .. Can be like that ! Midori ... Forgive me ... Luna ... I know This is the last time I leave you alone ! Be careful Where 's my wife ? Target their H.Q. ! - But your son 's inside . - I don 't care . Fire ! Mikio , I too , did what I thought best for our nation . Prepare to fire again . Isn 't that enough ? They may be a new breed to you . But inside they 're human . I 'll tell you something . She 's right In fact , you were just human . Eurasia , Zone Seven . has been totally scorched and eradicated by our Forces . Regrettably ... Azuma is not your " father " . His neo-cell research failed . We did discover though there once existed ' an ORIGINAL HUMAN' your people are our ancestors ... the " original humans " . That 's right . Hate to admit but Zone Seven is where civilization began . Naito brought you in to extract the neo-cells . But the research failed . Not enough bodies . Then we had the idea to make national policy fit medical needs . In other words they cut you people to pieces to help my father live longer . It 's like a bad joke . A crazy policy driven by the greed for long life . Your lofty theory is wrong . That 's a sad story Destined to hate us because you are us . Without even knowing ! Silence . Don 't you dare compare us ! It is a disgrace that the likes of you were called Neo-human You mutant trash I 'll tidy myself ! My daughter 's ... same pain taste it I don 't see anything . I don 't see it at all . Forgive me . Forgive me . Father ! Where are you going ? I 'm going home . Our house , Midori 's and mine ... Don 't worry , I won 't ask you to come . But your mother needs treatment . She 's dead . But you came back . where have you been looking at ! Father ! Our rebirth How many have suffered and died ... Are you blaming that I did something wrong ? That 's not it ! Looking at only one person 's own happiness can 't solve anything ! Do you mean that it is okay to lose someone you love for the greater good ? Anyone who loves a person , who carries the responsibility for someone would agree with me Don 't get in the way of our happiness . What are you doing ? Give Midori back ! Now ! I won 't . Do you know what it is to love ? I 'II soon bring her back . Mother ... In the end I ... couldn 't stop the fighting Not only that I have turned my back on all the tragedy What the hell ... was the point of my life ? What the hell ... was the meaning of my rebirth ? Mother ... Tetsuya ... Run away ... This isn 't really me ... I can 't help what I 'm doing ... I don 't want to hurt you ... ughh ... All the hatred I want to forget it .. All what has happened I want to erase it ... I know . Let 's end the hatred here . a .. hh .. I didn 't want to go through more pain ... still , it has come to this again But now you won 't be alone again . I 'll always be with you . Just us two from now on . At last I understand . We hurt others by our very existence . That 's just the way we live . We need to learn to forgive . Need to realize that existence is to be shared . We ' re not just here to exist ; but to find the strength to co-exist . It may start from something small , it may even seem impossible . But we must start from somewhere . That .. Is not too difficult Hope ... Hope is our children , Luna and mine ...

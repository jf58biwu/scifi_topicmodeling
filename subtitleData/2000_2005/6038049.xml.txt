 Previously on Farscape ... I am in control of ME ! - No more John . - There 's no Scorpius here . You burn Moya ? ... to save her . NO ! Crais and Talyn have located some kind of surgeon . If it wasn 't serious , they wouldn 't have called us . Hello , Delvian . John Crichton to Scorpius . Request immediately extraction . Given no other choices , I will shoot you down . Ejecting now ! - Aeryn ! Can you comply ? - Negative . Aeryn , listen to me . This is John- - it 's John . - Yeah , is it really you , John ? - Yes . - The harness is jammed . - Aeryn . No ! ... What have I done ? At peace ... Aeryn . Remove ... chip ... Take the damn thing out . Down there ! Hello , Doctor . So good to see you again . you no longer serve a purpose . I only hope ... the wormhole technology I 've waited so patiently for makes more sense . Goodbye . And now on Farscape ... Is there still no communication from the planet ? Nothing . The Diagnosian said we would be notified as soon as there was something to report . Pilot , any news ? I would have told you if there were . We should be down there at Crichton 's side . John did not want us there . We must respect that . The microt you hear anything Pilot . Yes . Zhaan . Pilot ! I remind you that we shouldn 't stay any longer than necessary . If the neural clone 's messages got through to Scorpius ... his command carrier must be on it 's way . We know that , Crais . Pilot , have you heard anything ? No ! When I know something , you 'll know it ! Until then- - leave me alone ! Is he always like that ? Aeryn 's death hit him pretty hard . It hit everybody hard . Now , why were you hiding , Grunschlk ? Well , why did you and your goons come storming in here with your guns drawn ? Oh , just a precaution . Precau- - ? Well , so was that . So go on son , put your precautions away and pay me ... what we agreed ! Listen . I informed you the microt that Crichton got here so you keep up your end of the deal , all right ? Listen son , you don 't want to frell with me on this one ! Grunschlk , if I was in your situation ... I 'd be attempting to present evidence that I still served a purpose . Does he ? Now that my neurochip has absorbed the information I need from John 's mind we 're finished here . Poor Crichton ... he 's going to be so lonely . Never mind . It 's me , John . I 'm still here . What ? ! No ! No , no , no , no , no , no . You 're gone ! The chip 's gone ! Get out of my head ! I 'd like to . But , I don 't wish to remain here , therefore you must die . My name is John Crichton I am lost an astronaut ... Shot through a wormhole ... In some distant part of the universe . I 'm trying to stay alive . Aboard this ship- - this living ship ... of escaped prisoners- - My friends . If you can hear me- - beware ... if I make it back ... will they follow ? If I open the door ... are you ready ? Earth is unprepared- - helpless ... for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay ? Protect my home ? Not show them ... you exist . But then you 'll never know the wonder 's I 've seen . Serve a purpose ? ' Course I serve a purpose . Any purpose you like- - sir . Got a purpose ? No ? Well- - I 'll come up with one . Look- - there-there 's a purpose in itself . Sir Officer Corbrind , I ordered you to remain with the Marauder . Yes , sir . However , we 've received an encoded message pulse from the command carrier . Report . Battle ended successfully . However , the unexpected duration of the engagement will delay our rendezvous 5 . 3 arns . 5 arns ... Crichton 's shipmates won 't stay away that long . We can eliminate them . They don 't worry me . A Leviathan gunship commanded by a vengeful traitor does . Sir . I flew us here undetected ! Because Crais and Talyn were preoccupied with Officer Sun 's last flight . If we were to leave now ... how long could you keep us undetected ? We 'd be a thousand metras away before the gunship detected us . Not good enough . The carrier is still so far off- - Talyn would easily overtake us- - we 'll wait . If you 're thinking of staying , sir . I 've got a splendid room , all the comforts , very private . Show us . Splendid . Death is the only sensible course , John . For everything there is a season- - a time to be born- - and a time to die ! Yes , yes , yes . The devil quotes scripture- - I thought you were put in here to protect me ! Until my task here was completed . Now that Scorpius has recovered the neurochip- - You should be gone ! How come you 're not ? ! I don 't know , but this ... this is intolerable , for both of us . End it John ! Free us from one another ! Scorpius has beaten you . Aeryn Sun is dead . Your power of speech is gone . The only one you 'll ever talk to again is me ! Is that how you want to live ? End it , John . Do it ! Grunschlk ! Where are you ? You told me that ship would be here by now ! Grunschlck ! Oh , Crichton You 're even more inarticulate than you- - Oh ! Tocot ? We 'll come down at once , Rygel . D 'Argo . Hey , we got a meal ready . There 's a problem . Zhaan , Stark and I are going down to the planet . We 'll go with you . No , I need you to stay here with Moya . Scorpius ' command carrier could arrive any microt . If it does , I want you to Starburst away immediately . But , but ... Pilot can ... please let ... Do ... what I tell you ! Frell ! Frell ! I 'm sick of this ! And when the service is finished , everyone except Crichton went back up to their ship , and the Doc , he started the surgery . And your last communication with any of them was when ? Uh ... nine or ten arns . Sir , the Marauders sensors have detected a transport pod leaving Moya on a vector towards us . They didn 't speak to you first ? They must be getting apprehensive . When they get here , let me speak to them . I 'll ah , I 'll stall them- - send them away . Whatever you want . I 'll say anything you like . How prescient of you . Yours is an interesting species Grunschlk . Simple mind- - Simple brain . Easily dominated . And easily controlled . About time ! Keep trying , Rygel ! You try ! I 've done everything you 've told me ... turned on the bio-neutralizer ... John ... Turned off the ' see-through skull machine ... enough is enough ! John ... ... it 's just not working ! He 's breathing ! Scor ... Scorpius . The command carrier couldn 't have arrived without our knowing . Scorpius , must have come in a Prowler or a Marauder on a stealth trajectory . Could he still be here ? Possibly . If so , reinforcements may follow . Talyn and I will adjust our orbit for maximum scan . Splendid room . All the comforts . Very private . Splendid room . All the confor ... very priv ... I 'll say - I 'll say - I 'll say anything you like ... I 'll say ... anything you like . Well , with a little diversion ... Braca . Let me see your pulse pistol . Splendid . Hoo ! Help ! Scorpius- - shot me- - took the chip . When ? A couple of arns ago . Gone now . Are you sure he 's gone ? Long gone . Grunschlk . You ... you use these poor beings as donors ! Doc couldn 't operate else ! Crichton didn 't want the operation if it would harm a donor ! But nobody was harmed ! The Doc was only borrowing some cerebral fluid to top off Crichton 's ! They can spare it . How can they be harmed if they are already dead ? Yeah ! They aren 't dead . Well , I mean , they 're effectively dead , because they can 't be restored and live . They 're trapped between two realms ... lost . Stark John needs our help now . Tocot- - what can we do now ? Well , ah ... Doc says he could try and restore his speech with a neural tissue transplant . But , it would use up a donor . You mean , ' kill ' . However you want . Crichton definately would not want that ! Look , it might not even work anyway . The Doc says this is so scrambled , he might not be able to fix no matter what ! If that 's the case ... we need to know . You want me to share Unity with him ? No- - I can 't . The last time I wasn 't strong enough to overcome Scorpius ' evil . The evil is gone now . The chip may have been removed , but- - the evil may still remain . If that 's true- - we still need to know . You 're not alone now Zhaan . Delvian ... Delvian ... Listen to Crichton ... hear his pain ... What should be do ? Should we help her break out of it ? Uh ... uh ... I don 't know . Go away Zhaan ... there 's no point ... Come out of it ! Break Unity ! Goddess be with him ! The Scorpius clone ... it 's still in his head . What ? ! How is that possible ? It didn 't work ! Why didn 't it work ? ! What did you do wrong ? They are never going to do what 's necessary . We know what has to be done ! We 're going to help you , John . Give me some Mornack injectant . We 're going to get that frelling madman out of your mind . I can 't see any . But , how about some Narbot serum ? It 's just as fast ... and painless . Zhaan what are you doing ? ! Let me go ! Hold her Stark . Crichton wants to die ! Hold her ! Zhaan , stop it ! He wants to die ! Be calm , be calm ! John is in agony . He begged me to kill him . We have already lost Aeryn . We will NOT lose another . Why is Scorpius still in Crichton 's mind ? Well the Doc figures it 's like a ' neural bleed ' . The ah , clone 's personality has been in there so long , that it 's conciousness has , like , ' merged ' with Crichton 's . Just remove it ! Well ... it 's-it-it 's not that easy . You just can 't cut it out with a scalpel sir . There 's only one merciful thing to do . Yeah , I would have to agree . All right , you two- - out ! Get out ! And do NOT come back into this chamber ! Right . Come on girl . What shall we do ? Whatever we can . You- - restore his speech . But ... Crichton insisted ... no harm ... to donor ... You 're the one harming the donors ! Their souls are crying out ! Screaming out in pain ! No ... pain ! I can hear them ! " Effectively dead ! " That isn 't death at all ! This- - is death ! And that ... that was mercy . His agony was far greater than yours . Now , my friend . Can you help John ? Can ... try ... Well , go ahead . And as for you- - Do NOT ... make me tongue you . You look pretty rouged . I need air . I will go outside and meditate . Yeah , now- - the weather 's cold- - gettin ' worse . Cold does not bother me . Pa 'u Zhaan , anything to report ? Not yet , Crais . Still in orbit ? Go chase that bastard , Scorpius . Their trail is cold . Talyn and I have found nothing to suggest a vector . So . What are you doing here then ? We await the delivery of the remains of Officer Sun . For the burial in space she would have wanted . Fine . I 'll load her coffin onto your transport pod , and , uh , Zhaan can bring her up to ya . I cannot face such a task right now . Help me out , eh ? I 'm tryin ' to get rid of that Yarbo and his gunship from my planet . I don 't trust him . When we all leave , we will take Aeryn Sun with us . Huh , if you all leave . I thought you weren 't hungry ? I wasn 't , until I started eating . You want some ? Come on ... it 'll put color in your cheek . No . Come on ... we 'll die of boredom . But we 'll be well fed . What 'd you do that for ? ! I don 't know . Think ! Well , maybe I don 't like being taken care of . Maybe I don 't like being bitten ! Yeah ? Well then , keep your hands outta my face ! Keep your hands outta my food ! Hey ! I helped make that ! Too bad ! Still bored ? Stop it . You better ... you better let go ... otherwise , I 'm going to have to try something else . You 'll lose an arm ! Well , you 'll lose worse ... than an arm . You wouldn 't do that . Don 't tell me what I- - what I would ... or would 'nt do . I do as I please . Okay ... do whatever you want . Done . Damage ... repaired . Speech ... should return . " Should " ? ! Will know ... soon . Hey ! Where are you going ? Must ... excrete . Aeryn 's gone ... want to die . Aeryn died so that you could live , John . She would want you to keep fighting . Lost ... still hear Scorpy ... Listen to me- - the chip 's out , it 's tendrils are dead ! The Scorpy in your head is merely a remnant . A ... a ... impotent wraith buzzing in your ear . You are stronger than he is ! Show him ! Hey , Harvey . Let 's have a little chat . I don 't wish to ' chat ' , John . I wish to leave . That is why you must die . Why don 't you kill me ? You did it before- - stopped my brain function cold . What 's the matter ? You lost your touch ? Circumstances are different now . Yes , they are . You got no connections , no backup , no power supply ... No place to hide ... I 'm going to make some rules now . Come on ... let me show you what I mean ... Now , John ... you listen to me ... Not this time , Scorpius . This brain ain 't big enough for the two of us . Now , Crichton ... I 'm warning you ! I 'm sorry , sweetheart . Come on , Scorpy ... come on , man . Show me that ugly grin ! I 'm warning you , Crichton . Now you stop ! Oh , No , no , no , no . I don 't think so , remember ? Out with the old , in with the new ! Can I get a " HELL , YEAH ! " ? ! " HELL , YEAH ! " It 's your time to pray , Scorpy . Pray for your soul , Scorpy- - if you have one- - and pray for the soul of Aeryn Sun ! Shut up ! One of the cryogenic pods is starting an autorelease sequence , eh ? Nah . Can 't be . Let me talk to him . Sorry , Doc . Say again ? What ? Full restoration ? You sure ? Nah , nah . It - it must be a screwed up sensor . You go back and tend to your patient , Doc . I 'll deal with it . Doc ... leave it to me ! Doc . Get out of there ! I 'll handle it ! Doc ... Doc ? A Scarran ... Why ? Get frelled . Grunschlk . You can do one of two things with your mouth . The first is talk to me . That is the second thing . All right ... You know the Scarrans are after you ... they found out this is where you had your ' cooling system ' installed , and they sent a spy who offered me currency to keep him hidden until you came back for a check-up . And you took his money . Just his advance . I was going to keep the dumb frell frozen , and hand him over to you . But you didn 't . When your goons came in locked and loaded , I kind of doubted your good intentions . As insurance I switched on the Scarran 's auto-release three arns delay . If you 'd behaved , and paid what we 'd agreed , I 'd have switched it off . I hope he kills you ... very slowly . Not likely . If my father finds out , we 're dead . He won 't find out . What the hezmana happened in here ? Oh , we were , ah , we were making some Soccherins and ... and the pot exploded . You ... blew up a cook pot ? ! We used too much lutra oil . The Grolaks fine though . Yeah , nice and crispy . Here . Sit down and eat . Ah , I 'll give the ah , I 'll give the Soccherins another try . I 'll ah , consume this in a room without detonating crockery . Thank you very much . We 'd better clean this up . I guess so . Crichton , D 'Argo and Stark are in the surgery room ... and the Scarran is in the cryo-chamber , level four . Shall I take care of it , sir ? With that ? ! He 'll saute you son ... He 's never taken on a Scarran , has he ? No ... Have you ? I beat him . He was all mouth , Stark . How did you know ? I didn 't . I just thought it sounded good . Well it worked . Harvey 's caged . Come on , lets pay the bill and get the hell out of here . I 'll find Zhaan . Plonik ! Erathran Plonik ! I 'm alone ! I 've got a present for you ! Grunschlk . Where is Scorpius ? He 's not here . Then why did you release me ? Well , I 've got someone almost as good , John Crichton . You know who that is ? Yes . Scorpius seems obsessed with him . We want to know why . Why don 't you ask him ? He 's in the surgery room , recovering . Are you lying ? Is this a trap ? No , no , no . No trap . Where is Scorpius ? Scorpius isn 't here . Scorpius isn 't here , I told you . But I 'm sure he 's on his way back to the planet ... to capture Crichton . Who is with Crichton ? Just a Luxan , and a Banik slave . I might have use for you later . That should divert the Scarran away from us . Officer Corbrind . We have received vital information , which I must deliver to my command carrier . Sir , the carrier is now much closer . I am certain we can outrun the gunship long enough to reach it safely . You have that much faith in your piloting skills ? My last rating was 991 , sir . No active pilot rates higher . Your skills will be tested . Very soon . Stark , look at these indicators . The cryo-systems activated to preserve the body until burial . But that 's not all . The Cyllian maintenance functions are still operating . Keeping her body alive . Why ? Unless Grunschlk was intending to keep her here as a donor . I wouldn 't put it past him . No- - the Diagnosian pronounced her dead . He could not save her . His gifts could not . I can hear the distant voices of the Interons , but- - I cannot hear Aeryn Sun 's . If her soul has not fled entirely , it 's much too far away to be reached . Even the attempt would be dangerous . Yes . You 're probably right . Zhaan . Stark ! Why don 't they answer ? Zhaan . Stark . What 's the delay ? Where the hell did that come from ? ! A Scarran . We have no weapons so I suggest a tactical retreat . That looks like an exit . Door controls . You didn 't bring any weapons ? ! I only brought down my Qualta Blade . It 's still sealed ! Well , how am I supposed to know about that ? Wait ! There 's a hatch ! Whoa ! I hate the cold . Freeze or fry . Freeze . Sir , the diversion 's working . The Scarran is moving outside in pursuit of Crichton and D 'Argo . However , two of the others are now blocking our path to the surface . If they see us , and notify Crais ... Two Commandos from the Marauder coming from this approach , could take them out and still maintain a Zero Presence profile . Summon them . No sign of the Scarran . Do you think he 's following ? Better hope he is . You sound like you got a plan . We 're going to bring him out here , and see how he likes being in the cold . And what if he likes it ? Look ! One plan- - at a time ! All right . Forgive me , Stark , but I need your strength . I know you would never allow me to risk this . Do you know who I am ? Do you know who you are ? Officer Aeryn Sun , Special Peacekeeper Commando , Icarion Company , Pleisar Regiment . Have you come to reassign me ? I 've come to take you back . Zhaan ? What is this ? Unity , Aeryn . The sharing of minds and souls . As our thoughts merge , you will understand . I understand that you shouldn 't be here . Nor should you . Why are you doing this ? Because I love you . More importantly ... Crichton loves you . You must take this gift , not for my sake , but for his . I can 't . I know your thoughts , and I know what this will cost you . Stop resisting , Aeryn . Accept this . No ! Aeryn ! We 'll take Stark with us . Capture or terminate ? Keep the Banik alive ... terminate the Delvian . You 're back . You 're back ... Oh , Zhaan . Success . Success . Where are the others ? Surgery . Report . The commandos are dead , Lieutenant . Even if Crais is now aware of our presence , the Scarran won 't stay diverted forever . Officer Corbrind- - we can wait no longer . Yes , sir . Here he comes ! Hell , I don 't think he likes the cold either ! Warm up the hot cocoa , baby ! Here we come ! It 's jammed ! I can 't believe this ! You have got to be kidding me ! - Unjam it . - What ? What are you gonna do ? ! Frell . Yes , Talyn , I see it . There is a vessel leaving the planet . No , a transport pod would not be attempting a stealth trajectory . Pursue . That 's my Qualta Blade ! Can 't be ! You left it in the coffin ! Hey ! Hey , Horseface ! D 'Argo ! Here . Oh ! No ! You 're gone ! It 's me , John . But it can 't be ! You 're- - you 're- - This is some kind of a trick ! She died ! Zhaan brought me back . She did a Unity thing . Zhaan . Oh , my ... my God ... Zhaan ? You 're alive ... Crais . Cease this pursuit at once . This pursuit will end in your death , Scorpius . Aboard this Marauder is information that will help us defeat the Scarrans . You may have foresworn the Peacekeepers , but before you act , consider your fellow Sebaceans . You consider one Sebacean who died at your hands- - Officer Aeryn Sun . Yes , Talyn , I see it . Command Carrier . Crais . You destroy this ship , my command carrier will destroy you . Possibly . Talyn- - are we in agreement ? Fire ! Pilot . Scorpius is dead . His command carrier is now in pursuit of Talyn , we 'll draw it away from your position before we Starburst . Scorpius is ... dead ? Yes . Officer Sun ... is avenged . Are you certain , Pilot ? Yes . Moya confirms it . Before Starbursting , Talyn told her that he destroyed Scorpius ' Marauder . Damn shame on two counts . Too quick , and I wasn 't there to see it . D 'Argo , I 'm with Zhaan . Did you find Tocot ? Yes . He 's dead . And what about Grunschlk ? He 's dead too ... effectively . Then we 're going to take these two with us . The Interons ? Why ? One of them died because of me . You think they can be saved ? You were . Signal from the command carrier , sir . Moya and Talyn have both fled . A Prowler detail is on it 's way to pick us up . The Marauder ? Destroyed . Plainly , Officer Corbrind overestimated his piloting skills . Well , perhaps Talyn is more formidable than we thought . Sir , Crais must be- - First Command has already taken care of that situation . Our task is much more important . We- - have a new Gammak Research Base ready to go into operation . Hundreds of Techs are waiting to apply this- - priceless information . Let 's not keep them waiting , Lieutenant . Taste all right ? That frelling planet got me so chilled I still can 't smell anything . But , ah , it is warming me up . Mine is more than adequate . All the time you two spent in here was ... ultimately productive . Two excellent cooks . I couldn 't be luckier . Well , I could . That frelling Grunschlk ! I paid for services and they were not rendered . I 'm delighted he 's dead ! Finished making your rounds ? I shouldn 't be here . This is exactly where you should be . I love you . I love you too . We will not act on it . What ... Aeryn ... My Peacekeeper training was right about one thing- - Soldiers , and emotional attachments . In battle , they distort your thinking . We 're not in battle , Aeryn . Scorpius is ... What happens- - what happens when Moya comes into contact with more Scarrans , or Nebari , or Sheyangs , or something worse ? I will not be the cause of any more deaths because my judgement was faulty ... I will not permit anyone else to sacrifice their life for mine . What do you mean " anyone else " ? Hello , John . Aeryn just told me that , uh ... whatever you did to bring her back ... A gift of spiritual energy . Yes ... that it took everything that you had . Is there anything we can do to help ? Nothing . I will not accept that . I have , John . I 'm dying .

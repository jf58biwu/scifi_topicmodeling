They are currently up to level C. That 's not enough . Raise it to level E. And increase the number of units . Yes , sir ! Raphael ... Are you curious about what 's inside there ? Episode Sixteen Similar Vessels You didn 't return to Ashurum , Kai Kudou ? Why do you know my name ? I did some investigating ... you belong to Ashurum 's psychic squad , AESES . The details of your duties are a class A top secret . During the recent Guerilla Sweep Operation , you went missing in action . I went through quite a bit of trouble just to get my hands on this much data ... Yuuki Tokugawa ... the handyman appears to have picked up something abandoned that he can 't quite handle ... Namely , you . Wha ? ! Even though your health recovered , you didn 't leave his house , and you didn 't go back to Ashurum . Why is that ? Why ? There 's no need for you to know why ! There 's no need for me to force an answer out of you , either . You 're no longer a part of Ashurum , right ? Join us . What kind of selfish things are you saying ? ! I have no intention of helping you people ! In that case , where are you saying you intend to go ? What are you saying you 're going to use that power for ? Stay here ... just like Raphael and the others ... Raphael ... Kai ... Thank goodness ... you came back to us ... Thank goodness ... Raphael ! It looks like I 'm kind of tired ... What are you making Raphael and the others do ? ! Kai , it 's okay ... If I rest for a little bit , I 'll get better ... If you 're a psychic , then you know that too , right ? Raphael ... I 'm sorry ... you 've finally come back , but ... let me rest a little ... Raphael ! Kai Kudou ... Come with me . Relax ... Raphael is receiving proper treatment ... Of course he is ! Right . It 's a matter of course ... but for their parents and their siblings , it isn 't a matter of course . They 've heard that psychics are able to heal certain kinds of injuries with their psychic powers . You understand , don 't you ? Because of those powers , people fear them , they are persecuted , and their existences have been denied . Even their own flesh and blood have forsaken them ... Raphael and the others were awakened as psychics from the time they were born ... Of course , there aren 't any places in Gald that would welcome psychics the way that Ashurum would . That is why we shelter them . That just seems like a lie to me . They 're ... You have nothing you can condemn us for . After all , this is a paradise to them ... Paradise ? ! What part of this place is a paradise ? In truth , Raphael and the others are suffering through things like that ! What are you making them do ? ! Despite that , they are happy ... although it might be difficult for you to comprehend that ... This is ... End this ! If you so wish , then I can end it ... Do you need my power ? I have no desire to make you use the powers you developed at Ashurum for the sake of the guerillas , or to make you leave it untapped ... Only by wielding those powers for us will they become the powers that will allow us to get the Sacrament of Calvaria ... Calvaria ... Hey ! Dinner 's ready ! Asuka , Kai ! Hurry up and grow big , okay ? Because when Kai returns , we 're going to surprise him . Right ? Yuuki ... Dinner 's ready . Okay ! You 're going to help us , yes ? What 's your answer ? I can 't imagine that you think of Raphael and the others as anything more than a convenience ... I ... I will not serve you ! Lord Ghibelline ! What is going on ? ! This guy is ... It looks like you don 't understand anything ! What ? Everyone in this place had a lot of people they knew killed during Ashurum 's Guerilla Sweep Operation ... Family ... friends ... lovers ... People dear to them ... killed by you guys ... by Ashurum ... Gald , which had been destroyed ... we are trying to rebuild it all ... Kai Kudou ... serve us ... you are to search for the Sacrament of Calvaria ... Since I 've arrived in Gald , I 've come to understand well that psychics are being persecuted . It 's certain that what that man says is true . It might be happier for Raphael and the others to stay here ... But ... Kai ... What 's wrong ? Raphael ? You were awake ? That 's no good , you need to sleep ! You were worried about me . Come on , now , in any case , you need to rest in your bed . If you want to talk , then I 'll come to where you are . Okay ? Okay ... Is this all right ? Yeah ... Then come closer ... close enough that I can see your face properly , Kai . Is this all right ? Kai , you just said the same thing I did . What 's wrong ? When you stare at me like that , I ... Kai , you ... you 're similar ... I am ? Yeah ... to a friend who died . When you appeared before me , I was happy that my friend , who had died , had come back to me . I thought that it was just as Lord Ghibelline said ... that this was the happiest place ... His name was Samael ... the way he talked and stuff were really similar to you , Kai ... He always said the same things I did just like you , Kai ... Raphael , I ... Hey ... do you cry , Kai ? What ? How do you make it so tears appear ? Well ... I couldn 't even cry when Samael died even though I was so sad . If tears don 't appear when I 'm sad , then ... There 's also ... umm ... There 's also when you 're happy , I guess ... When you 're happy ? Right ... Have you cried because you were happy ? No ... I haven 't , but ... I see ... When you 're happy , huh ? That sounds nice ... Kai ? Are you crying ? You are to search for the Sacrament of Calvaria ... The Sacrament of Calvaria ? There was only one person who had any leads to the Sacrament ... The former head of the church , Martino the Fourteenth ... However , one day , all of the sudden , he vanished , before the eyes of several priests . You know what this means , yes ? He was a psychic too . And this Sacrament of Calvaria , which even the former head of the church was searching for ... You are going to find it . You 're ... Are you asking who I am ? What ? Are you able to answer the question of who you are ? What ? You 're in my way . A psychic ? Wow ! It 's a doll ! Look , big brother Eiji ! My big brother Kai gave this to me as a present ! I 'm looking ... it looks like it 's caught your fancy ... I 'm sure that Kai will be happy too ... Yeah ! You 've been out of bed a lot longer than you usually are ... come now ... No ... I still wanna stay up ... Prepare a tranquilizer ... Yes , sir ! No , wait . This is strange ... Her pulse is normal , and on top of that , there 's no change to her body temperature ... Even though she 's actually fallen into a fevered state ... For just those feelings to flare up means that ... Big ... brother ... It might be possible that ... I can 't let you have a boring death ... in a place like this . Hikaru ! Kai ... He 's ... Who are you ? ! Who ? Don 't make me say this twice ... Are you able to answer the question of who you are ? W-What are you saying ? He disappeared ... no , he 's here ! The next attack will be coming soon ! He 's above me ! Somebody ... Chief ... Chief , my leg is caught ... somebody ... please call somebody ... Chief ! Where is he ? Where 's the next attack going to come from ? You stopped it ? That 's how it should be ... There are unusual movements on level two hundred of the special ward ! We can 't contact them ! The line has been cut off ! You don 't know what 's happened ? Big brother ... big brother ... When morning comes ... I 'll wake you up ... Does it feel like you 've met your own ghost ? That 's right ... You should have been able to predict my movements ... Just as if they were your own ... I can tell ... even the fact that this guy has no intention of killing me ... I know this guy ? Despite that , why can 't you dodge ? I guess that 's it ... Why ? Ask yourself . Everything you want to know is inside of you . Reclaim your body ... your sensitivity ... your memories ... What is he saying ? The way you are right now , you 're not even worth killing . Try to answer the question ... of who you are ... I 'm ... I 'm ... me .

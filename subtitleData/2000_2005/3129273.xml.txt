 Leave my daughter alone ! Let my child through ! I want to go to my child . Why did you do it ? My daughter was cloned from one of my cells , and she was born in the normal way 9 months later . If you have questions , ask me or my management , but not my daughter . Thank goodness , she 's asleep . Did you know it ? I always wondered about the resemblance , but ... That poor child . I ... I should have known . I feel cold . I don 't know what to do now . You can 't abandon Siri now . Professor Fischer removed an ovum from my belly and brought it to life . Then he replanted it in my belly and you began to grow . For 9 months , like every other child . You 're my daughter , and I love you . It 's wonderful that we 're so similar . Go to sleep , princess . Everything will be fine tomorrow . You broke our contract . It 's your fault that Siri had a breakdown . I told you she couldn 't handle it . She had to find out . - Not like that . I wanted to tell her ... gently , gradually . She 'll get over the shock . Should I come to Germany ? - Are you crazy ? I never want to see you again , never . Possibly a depressive stupor . - How long can it last ? - No idea . It 's a psychological shock ... - I don 't understand . She has to go to a hospital . - No ! She 's staying here . I 'll take the responsibility . Then find some way of reaching her , something familiar . Try to bring her back . Janeck wrote you a letter from New York . He sent two pictures , as well . Look ... I 'll put them here , okay ? Want me to read you the letter ? Think I don 't know you 're pretending ? I know you hear me ! You want to punish me ! I have no time for such nonsense ! I want to write an opera , but I haven 't much time left ! I 'm more sick than you ! Wake up ! Wake up ! Wake up ! CLONE FATHER FISCHER ARRESTED If only Janeck were here ... Thank you , Daniela . Siri ! Child ... What happened ? Come here . Stop it ! Come here ! - Stop it ! Leave me alone ! It 's okay . I 'm so happy you 're awake again . It 's okay . I knew you were strong . You 're my girl . You 're my girl . We 'll play a concert together , okay ? We 'll start rehearsing tomorrow , okay ? You are my life . Iris ! Iris ! - I 'm here . Here 's what you ordered . They just finished it . I don 't know if it 's a good idea . I do . Has Siri completely recovered ? Everything 's fine now . There 's no need to be afraid . The rehearsals were perfect . The audience will love you ... Perhaps more than me . 3 more minutes . I 'm going out now ... Good luck . Your entry is decisive . The audience watches you walk to the instrument and makes a judgment about the whole concert . CLONE Encore ! Encore ! Thanks for the invitation . Have you been waiting long ? - Not long enough for it to grow back . I 'll help you . - Thank you . I came by boat . It 's not a good day for flying . And this way I can stay longer , if you insist . It 's from an admirer who 's running out of buckets . Thank you . Blueberry pie ... my favorite . Can I do anything else ? - No . Are you all right ? My mother is dying . Want to talk about it ? There 's no rush . Come with me , I 'd like to show you something . I left off the legs , so we can carry it into the house , but ... maybe you want to play it here . Why did you do it ? I wanted to make you happy . Not like this . I thought it would make you happy . I don 't want it anymore . - What don 't you want ? Stop it . It 's pointless . Go home ! What did I do wrong ? Everything ! Get out ! Get lost ! - I 'll make it up to you . No ! You 're too fast . What 's wrong ? Nothing . It 's our last concert together . I want it to be perfect . - Sure . Too fast ? Do you think she 's attractive ? She 's no more than a child . She 's no longer a child , but she 's young and pretty . Do you think she 's attractive ? I think she 's pretty ... because she resembles you more and more . Yeah ? - Hi , Kristian . It 's me , Iris . It 's nice to hear from you . How 's your farewell tour going ? Still in Rome ? No , I 'm in Hamburg for a night before flying on to Stockholm . - Aha . I miss you . I 'll expect you at 9 in my suite at the Dorint . - See you then . I 'm here . I 'm so happy ... Don 't turn the light on . What 's up ? Come here . Get undressed . I know you want me ! Are you crazy ? Why don 't you want me ? I 'm just like her ! What if Iris finds out ! Don 't worry . I won 't tell her . You 'll never see her again ! - Yes , I will . I love her . No way ! I 'll tell her that you seduced me ! You know she 'll believe me , not you ! She saw how you looked at me ! You 're sick ! There aren 't even two grains of sand that are identical . Isn 't that a miracle ? - I don 't believe in miracles . Unless I create them myself . You , you , you ! Everyone else is so small and imperfect . By the way , what about Kristian ? - It 's over . Your first affair that lasted more than a few weeks is over ? Probably because of that hotel fling . What fling ? - Didn 't you break up , because he tried to seduce me ? What ? You heard me . You didn 't sleep with him . What if I did ? You can have him back . He isn 't so great . Or we can share . Your turn ... my turn ... You still think I 'm your life ? We have to talk about Kristian . I don 't want him to come between us . No man can tear us apart . - Of course not . Neither father , lover , Bach nor Mozart ... Sorry , Mom . Too late . I 'm playing my first concert in 2 months ... alone . Just my name on the billboard . Hey , it 's okay . It 's okay . She 's coming ! There she is ! What are you doing here ? Stop it ! Out of the way ! Leave us alone ! Here 's my super special " forget-it-all " nightcap ... made just for you . Later ... Okay . I 'm next door , if you need anything . Sleep tight , sister . Morning . Good morning ... Coffee ? - Hmm . Thank you . Nice to see you smile . By the way , you were the first one . - I know . And the first person to have sex with a clone , too . - I 'm impressed . But it was still quite normal ... and nice . Should I drive you home ? No , I 'm never going home again . " Blurred Blueprint . " Sure , I am . Blurred ? Sharp and hot . Mom ? - Siri ? Mom ? - I 'm here ! Are you alone ? - Daniela has gone shopping . How nice to have you back . Come on , play something for me . It 'll make me feel better . I 'm never going to play again , Mom . Pah ! I used to say that all the time , too . Here . I found some very critical old reviews . Here ... Here 's another one . DISAPPOINTING PERFORMANCE IN HAMBURG FLOP IN NEWYORK This one 's terrible ... here . A Sellin never gives up . I came to say I 'm living with Janeck , and I 'm not coming back . Never again . And I 'll never play the piano again . Come in . Have a seat . Want something to drink ? Yes . Don 't mind the chaos . I learned your lesson well . Music begins somewhere between order and chaos . Until now I only existed for your music . Now it 's time for chaos . I came to get you . But I don 't want to come back . Strange , huh ... I 'm the first clone , but I 'm rebelling like any normal child that 's gone bad . You haven 't gone bad . No ? Oh yes , from the beginning . Why am I alive anyway ? Because you loved someone so much you wanted to have his child ? No , that 'd be beneath you . You loved yourself so much you wanted to have your own child . Perhaps before your birth , but then I loved you and still do today . I don 't understand . Why d 'you want to start your life all over again ? Because it 's the only chance for me to grow . I don 't want to be like you and hear : " You are my life . " Your creation isn 't as perfect as you planned . I have an idea . Shall we try it again ? Shall I bear the Sellin triplet ? What a good idea ! Stop it ! You 're all I have . Strange ... I 'm all I have , too . Why should I stay with you ? I don 't even want to stay with myself . I 'm going far away ... This is Janeck Hausmann . I need an ambulance . My girlfriend took an overdose . 24 Goethe Street , downtown M ? Ster . Come quickly , please . Where 's Greg Lukas ' house ? Come on , I 'll show you on the map . May I come in ? I wanted to say ... I 'm sorry . What music was that ? How long have you known ? Since yesterday . There was a delivery note in the crate with the return address . I collected information all night . I know a lot about Iris Sellin ... and her daughter Siri Sellin . Well ? Well ... I think I can imagine how you feel sometimes . I don 't know if anyone can imagine it . I 'm the first cloned human , a blueprint . My mother is the original . I 'm just a copy of her . It 's good that nobody here knows who I am . I 've found my peace here , especially without my mother . But now she 's dying and I don 't know what to do . I play my dad 's old jazz records . And I fly his plane . He died here in this house , while I was in Toronto . I 'd miss him less if I had come back once more . I 've needed two years and an ocean between us to get my feet back on the ground . I don 't know if I have the strength to go back . I feel you 're much stronger than you think . I ... I ... I liked the copy long before I knew about the original . The first time I saw you . Even as you growled at me in the woods . To me , you 're the original . I think you have to go . How about a return trip ? With an emphasis on " return " . Thank you . Excuse me , have a look at this . She 's that clone . Thank you . I 'm so glad you 're here . Nice to see you , brother . - You look great . You 're lucky you came voluntarily . I almost went to the wishing-tower to get you back . How is she ? My little girl . We brought her back home . She wants to die here . You 've really grown up . There 's something you have to do before you see her . He stayed beside her for a long time but he wanted to talk to you too . He 's been waiting for you for hours . You 're so pretty . You resemble her so much . I wanted you to know that I 'll be around whenever you need help . After all ... I 'm kind of your father . What your mother and I did can benefit many people . Thoughts must be turned into action . It 's the basis of all research . Regardless of what the costs are ? You were always so sure of yourself . I remember you facing all those cameras and saying that you couldn 't understand the outcry . We should ask the clone in 20 years if it wasn 't better to be alive than not to be alive . Are you still so sure of yourself ? No ? I did it for her , too . I loved her . I 'm going to see her . Mom , I 'm here . It 's me , Siri . Who are you ? Daniela , get this woman out of here . Where 's my daughter ? Do you recognize me now ? You 've come back . Play Mozart . She wanted me to give you this after it was all over . Dear God , make what you like out of me ... a stone , a tree , a bird , but just don 't make me anew . C.G. Lichtenberg I 'm back . I survived my own death .

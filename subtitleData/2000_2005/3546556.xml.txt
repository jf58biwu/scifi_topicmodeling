Oh , you mean , the ankle pads and the extra hip pockets ... that served absolutely no purpose ? Yes , I 've ripped them off . - But - - Look , Mauser , the 21st century , the one year I saw of it , guys got a little further by complimenting a girl 's outfit . Good luck . It covers you well . Hel ? Come on , honestly . That 's great , Cleo . Sarge , we 're under attack ! Hel , what 's happening ? - What the hell was that ? - I don 't know , but I don 't like it . Tuck and roll . - Hel , is Mauser secure ? - Not yet . Hel , Mauser must not be captured . Creegan , we 're not secure . I don 't care . I want Mauser ! Creegan . - Hel , have you secured Mauser ? - Not yet . Mauser must not be captured . If you can 't secure him , eliminate him . Now ... that wasn 't so hard , was it ? Mauser 's dead ! Not dead . He 's just offline . Let 's go ! Creegan ! Helen . Five hundred years into the future , she will enter a world where machines rule the Earth . Mankind has been driven underground .

Hel , everything we know , Mauser knows . If Creegan compromises that , he could access critical information about you , the other teams , every level we 've charted . Creegan 's not gonna get that far . - Need a third wheel ? - Sure don 't recommend staying here . Come on , Hel . Ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three . Wake up . Hi . If you 're planning on splitting my nanoplasma , you 're wasting your time . It 's encoded with four security backups . I thought it was five . At least let me try . Unless of course you wanna tell me in your own words ... everything I want to hear . Siphon . Siphon activated . With you in a sec . The signal 's weak . We haven 't got much time . Keep moving down . Hey , Hel . - That Creegan , what did he do ? - He murdered my family . Wait ! Where is she going ? The Voice is leading us to Mauser . Face value . You just accept that ? Never had a reason not to . So who 's this Voice ? The Voice has saved us more times than I can remember . She 's the reason we 're gonna take back the surface . So who is this - Mr. Mauser . I can only hope that you 're too important ... for Helen and company not to look for you . So ... I command you , where 's that little homing beacon ? Hemisphere 5 , Grid 23 of the neurosynaptic net . What does that mean ? You know what that means ? Anyone ? Why can 't you just say : " Behind my left ear ! " Always making them harder to reach . But ... I do believe we have a trace . And there she is . Leave me . Just buy me some play time . - Mauser 's 30 meters down . - Helen . Then make a hard left and you 're there . - Voice ? - He-Hel . - Hello ? - What 's happening ? Helen ? Creegan . So you do carry the Voice . You like mine better ? It sounds different . Well , I guess that 's what happens when somebody rips out half your throat . What was dear old Dad trying to do to me , huh ? What I 'm gonna do to you . You know , Helen , with the proper pitch , that little voice receptor inside your head ... could actually ... burst ! No , that 's not it . I 'd love to chat with you in person , but Mauser just can 't seem to keep his head shut . He 's already told me everything I need to know about you . Others like you . O - Others like me ? What are you talkin ' about ? Mindless drones , running around , doing errands for a voice . And for what , I ask . To rid the underworld of Betrayers ? To retake the surface from the mighty Bailies ? Exercises in futility , Helen . Tell me we 're almost there . Unless the Voice knows something I don 't . Perhaps Mauser can shed some light on that subject , too . Bye . Launch the attack . Hel ! Hel ! Sarge ! I can 't hold them , Hel . Go back to the shaft ! Come on , Hel . Hel , are you okay ? It 's up to you . Come on , Hel , talk to us . Creegan tapped the beacon . - He 's gonna blow the voice receptor . - Take it out . No time ! Go get Mauser ! - Maybe a precision shot up the jaw . - What are you doing ? The receptor 's in her ear . - So shooting it out 's gonna do the trick ? - Sarge , go ! No . All for one and one for nothing . Right , Cleo ? - Yeah . - Sarge ! Take this ! What is this ? What do I do with this ? Just run it up her jaw and remove the voice receptor . No , no , no . See , I 've never even played a surgeon ! I 'm a little busy right now ! Stop ! Go back . Isn 't she dying right about now ? Hurry ! What am I looking for ? You 'll know it when you see it . I see it ! I see it ! You got to cut it out . Okay . Hurry . Almost there , Hel . Okay . Okay . I got it . I got it ! I got it , okay . Okay . Hello . Do you hear me ? Hel . Hello . Hello . Come on . Mr. Mauser . This weapon is Bailey in origin . Hel has made progress in leaps and bounds , hasn 't she ? - Sarge , get to Mauser . - If we 're not too late already . I 'll cover you . Protect the plasma . Sarge , the siphon ! Out of my way ! They 've blown up the siphon and damaged the link to the main source . Sarge ! Sarge ! Come here . They 've cut off the siphon . Mauser 's memory download has stopped . Give me what we have . We don 't have anything . The information was deleted . I 'm upset you 're here , Helen . But if you tell me more about this Bailey toy of yours , perhaps I can rechannel some of my anger . I 'm speaking to Helen ! So tell me . Did Mauser incorporate some of this technology into your arsenal ? You 're about to find out . That 's not it , Hel . No , but this is . Sarge , now ! Sorry , sorry . There we go , Hel . - You should be hearing voices anytime now . - Thanks , Cleo , you did good . Thanks . Hel , I 'm sorry I couldn 't stop him . Hey , it 's okay , Mauser , really . - Hel ? Can you hear me ? - Yes , Voice , I hear you . - We got Mauser back . - And Creegan ? He didn 't get anything , but we didn 't get him . Don 't worry , we will . So , Voice , both you and Creegan mentioned something about " others like me . " Is there something you wanna tell me ? Their identities and their locations are safe because of you and your team , Hel . I don 't know what else to say , but ... you 're not alone . Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries

All they left was baking soda and capers . And here it is ! Ugh ! Great . We 're two days from Earth with no food . Fight to the death. I 'll cook the loser . Work his gut. I like it tender . Maybe that planet has a drive-thru ! Burger Jerk , Fishy Joe 's or Chiseler . No , we 're a billion miles from nowhere . It probably only has a Howard Johnson 's . A type-M planet , so it should at least have Rodden berries . I 'm good at foraging . I found mushrooms on my bathmat . I found some rocks ! You eat rocks , right ? - No . - Not even saut√©ed in a little mud ? Look ! A ditch full of fried shrimp ! Are you blind ? Looks more like a hole full of fried prawns . [ WHlRRlNG ] This thing on my wrist says they 're not poisonous . Well , how are they ? They 're great ! They 're like sex ! Except I 'm having them ! These would go great with rocks ! Look ! Here 's more ! - The planet 's full of them ! - l 'll take a few . - No ! A whole Bender-ful ! - Only what we need . Stuff the ship ! Planet Express ship , you are cleared to land .

What about Tasty-cles ? Ugh ! - Not that . - Why not ? It sounds like frozen mountain oysters on a stick . You know , Test-cicles . The only names not yet trademarked are ... ... Popplers and Zittzers . - We 'll call them " Popplers " ! ZOlDBERG : Yeah . Why not ? AMY : You picked it . - Swish ! Call them what you want . I call them a free meal . Slow down there , Sigmund ! I can 't stand poor people getting free food . - We gotta sell these things ! - Yeah ! - Good idea ! - Bender 's a genius ! - Business is great . - Great 's okay . Amazing would be great ! [ FEET stepping ] Don 't push ! There 's hot dogs for everyone ! [ GROWLS ] Where do you want those rat droppings you ordered ? - Ugh ! WOMAN : Disgusting !

I wanted to write you about the in-store kiddie parks . - The slides won 't support a robot . - Not interested . But these are great ! - How much ? - $ 1 a dozen . You 'll never make money . Supply them to me ... ... and I 'll sell them for $ 2 a dozen . I 'll even pay you $ 1 a dozen . I 'll be rich ! You too , but that doesn 't excite me . How do we sign ?

We taught a lion to eat tofu . [ COUGHS ] The point is , you shouldn 't eat things that feel pain- - - Okay , we won 't eat you ! - l 'll go get some more bricks . I wish you 'd throw out these old Popplers . They 're getting big and scaly . There 's one left . Mama ! [ giggles ] Stop ! Stop eating Popplers ! - Why ? - My booze ! Popplers are intelligent ! This one called me mama ! Congratulations ! I assume Amy is the father ? Popplers can 't talk . She 's hallucinating from lack of Popplers . Eat some now ! - No ! - l said eat ! Come on , mangia ! - Sorry , babies . - Maybe you should lie down . Yes , listen to the father . I 'm telling you it spoke to me . Come on , little Poppler . Say mama ? Hearing one talk doesn 't mean it 's intelligent . - Parrots talk and we eat them , right ? - Maybe it learned as a parlor trick . - Like Fry . - Like Fry ! Like Fry ! There 's one way , and only one way , to determine if an animal is intelligent . Dissect its brain . No ! Mama ! Stop Grandpa ! [ gasping ] Enough chitchat ! Restrain the specimen ! MAN : Good .

He is crazy . - There isn ' t evidence of intelligence . - Shut up , shut up . - Not true . This one talks . Say mama . - Ca-ca . We 'll bleep that . I 'm not saying eating meat is wrong . - No one 's here to make that claim . - I am ! - Eating smart animals is different . - Shut up , shut up . Don ' t force your tired philosophy on us . The reason we don ' t eat people is the lousy taste . You 're nuts . Shut up . Let me talk . - You shut up . - No , you shut up . Popplers are no smarter than any other animal I 've served , cats included . - Ca-ca head . Mean , old ca-ca head . - Sir , I 'm making a point . If these gutter-mouths are so smart , why don ' t they defend themselves ? - Stop it ! - I call murder on that ! I 'm willing to grant it 's murder . The real issue is who ' s gonna stop me ? [ LOUD rumbling ] We seem to be experiencing technical difficulties . And crap like I 've never seen ! People of Earth , I am Lure of the planet Omicron Persei Eight . Turn down the TV , Indunda . Dear Lord , they 're back ! - We 're doomed ! - Doomed ! Doomed ! The creatures you call Popplers come from a nursery planet in our sector . You monsters have been eating our babies ! Ugh . We demand justice ! As you ate our children , so shall you be eaten by us ! We 'll begin with the firemen , then the math teachers and so on in that fashion until everyone is eaten . Transmission over ! Well , that went okay . When you know you can ' t scratch , that 's when you really have to . Oh , yeah ! That feels a lot better- - What ? It 's still on ? I speak for all of Earth ... ... when I mourn the loss of the Omicronian young . We share your pain . If we could undo the damage ... . It 'd be great with quack-a-mole . Stop eating our young ! And it 's guacamole ! All right. I 'm putting them away . [ chewing ] Now , what is it you want ? We demand ... ... to eat one human for each Omicronian that was eaten ! Fair enough . How many is that ? It 's 1 98 billion , sir . Very well . You will provide us with 1 98 billion humans . - And small fries . - Lure ! All right . Cottage cheese . Sir ? There aren 't that many human beings . A thought : There aren 't that many humans . We 'll wait while you shore up the numbers . Well , 1 98 billion babies in a few weeks .

Bender means you 're really brave , smart , beautiful and a great friend . Just like titanium . What a load ! I was the one trying to save the Popplers ! You ate them like the fat hog you are ! And you were stepping on them for fun ! - You should be in here ! - Someone 's acting awfully aluminum . My sweet , I 've come to save you . I have a devious plan . Great . Captain Moron has a plan . Tell it to Wingus and Dingus . Wingus ? Dingus ? We 're going to give the aliens the old switcheroo . - You mean- - ? - Correct . I found a giant , hideous ape that looks exactly like Leela . It doesn 't look anything like me ! The hair 's all wrong . Don 't worry . Kif is an expert stylist as you can plainly see . This might actually work . Omicronians have trouble telling people apart . True . They thought Kif was the statesman ... ... and I , a jabbering mental patient . Right , Kif ? Please , I 'm creating ! Voila ! BENDER : Bingo ! - That 's Leela ! - l 'm seeing double ! I grow hungry ! Bring on the one called Leela . - That comes with salad or soup . - Salad . - Ranch or vinaigrette ? - Vinaigrette . Balsamic or raspberry ? WOMAN 1 : What 's going on here ?

It 's an orangutan , one of Mother Earth 's most precious creatures . Why 'd you open your bong hole , you smelly hippie ? You 'd sacrifice a beautiful woman for an attractive monkey ? You must have smoked some bad granola . The one called Smelly Hippie is right ! This is a monkey ! Yes . Definitely . Where is the real female ? - l 'll never tell . - Where is she ? I 'll get her for you . This may hurt our chances of consummating our relationship again . - Go consummate yourself . - Stop talking ! You 're getting cold ! Please ! I just paid off my car ! - No ! - l can 't look ! JURR : Stop ! People of Earth , I am Jurr of the planet Omicron Persei Eight . Could you lower this thing for me ?

There are many good reasons to eat ! Hunger , boredom , wanting to be the world 's fattest man ! But not revenge . Are we no better than they ? Besides , Leela 's my friend . - She 's your friend ? - Yeah , I am ! Leela 's garbled words have opened my eyes ! [ cheering ] Okay , that 's a start . It 's very earth-friendly .

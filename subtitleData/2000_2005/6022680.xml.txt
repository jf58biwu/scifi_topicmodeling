 Previously on Farscape . I will find them again , and when I do , they will pay for this humiliation . I finally figured out wormholes . You did it . All that wormhole nonsense we put up with . Wormholes are his obsession . Wormholes bridge space-time , creating a unique ability to navigate . The moment the Ancients implanted that knowledge , you exist to service a larger ... No ! No . What do you desire with wormholes ? For starters ? Go home . D 'Argo ? Pilot ? Whoops . And now on Farscape . Home . That really is Kansas . D ? Pilot , can you hear me ? No , ' course not . Nothing . I can 't believe I 'm gonna die here . It 's the most beautiful thing I 've ever seen . John . Where are you ? D 'Argo ? - Son of a bitch ! - How can you hear me ? I don 't know . The wormhole keeps opening and closing . Where are you ? Don 't worry about that right now . Just do exactly what I say . Follow my instructions . Lock onto my voice signal . When the wormhole opens again , follow it . Pilot , I 'm leaving Sikozu and Scorpius on board . You can 't leave fek-face here . To make sure he doesn 't do anything , I 'd like you to begin to lock down all the systems . Beginning power down ... now . The rest of us are going after Crichton . Shee-aw . Pilot , I don 't see any wormhole out here . 500 bottles of beer on the wall , 500 bottles of beer , take one down , pass it around ... Wait for it . ... one down , pass it around ... Everybody okay ? - He did it . ... beer on the wall , 6 bottles of beer , - There he is . John , we 're here . We made it . Hey , you 're early ! I still got a six pack . Where are ya ? We 're coming in behind you . Turn around and prepare for immediate retrieval . All right . D , I need a radio signal . Coming in clean , John . Nothing 's locking onto us . Just need to know what year it is . Okay . Got something . ... on the Senate floor . Commenting from the White House , President Reagan told reporters the situation in Nicaragua had unraveled to such an extent that the State Department ... - What 's the matter ? Reagan was president in the 1980s . Einstein said if I came back before I left , it would screw things up . D , we need to get down there and check it out . Okay . Home . I can 't believe I 'm home . Touchdown ! D. Keep everybody off Comms and the ship invisible . I 'm just gonna check things out . Einstein said if there was a problem with the timeline , it would start close to me . Oh , Betty . Dad , Dad , you ready ? Mom ! Hey ! Congratulations , honey . We 're so very proud of you , aren 't we ? Sure are . - You guys shouldn 't have gone to the trouble . That looks good . Give me a kiss . Thank you . Did you do that ? - Johnny ? Did you do the writing on that ? - Looks pretty nice . What about the champagne ? Are you gonna open it for us ? I 'll get to it , Mom . That 's me . Son of a gun . - Olivia , I can 't wait to have a slice . You sure we just can 't cut to the cake ? Lift off . The 25th Space Shuttle mission and it has cleared the tower . Oh , God . D. I don 't know how I did it , but my dad 's going up on the Challenger . John , what are you talking about ? 1986 . The Challenger space shuttle exploded , killing everyone on board . My dad wasn 't on that flight . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . Three years ago I got shot through a wormhole . I 'm in a distant part of the universe aboard this living ship of escaped prisoners , my friends . I 've made enemies . Powerful , dangerous . Now all I want is to find a way home to warn Earth . Look upward and share the wonders I 've seen . Not to be insensitive , but in the scheme of things , well , what does it matter if your father flies and dies ? My father got me started in avionics . No Dad , no Farscape project . You stay in Peacekeeper custody , she remains a Nazi , she ends up on Nebari Prime . We get it . How do we fix this ? Einstein said the change ripples out from the first mutation . We fix that , everything else falls back into place . So if you can get your father to refuse this Challenger flight ... Everything should turn back to normal . Look , we can 't all stay here . I don 't know how long this is gonna take . But I know a place we might hang out . And we have one piece of luck . Tomorrow 's Halloween . - What 's that ? Well , that 's something that means you 're gonna fit in just fine , Grandma . The dust on this planet is playing havoc with my sinuses . Shee-aw , what 's all this ? Cops busted the owner for drugs . They sealed the place up . For a while , there were some gang kids living here . Drad . Are those jeans ? Let me see those . Here . This is your home ? No , Rygel , it 's not my home . Don 't worry , we 're only gonna be here for a couple of arns . Just gotta find a way to keep my dad from going on the Challenger . Yeah , these 'll fit . Y 'all might wanna stay out of sight . We don 't wanna screw up the universe any more than I already have . Good luck . Get back in here ! Get back here now ! Not in the street ! Jack ! Johnny ! Go check the Tarot cards , Mom ! - What ? They 'll predict he 'll walk all over you again ! Stop ! Just stop ! And I asked you what I should do . And then you did exactly what you wanted ! Can we please move back inside before the entire neighborhood calls 9-1-1 ? Oh , just shut up , Mom , please . - Don 't you talk to her like that ! Don 't touch me ! And don 't you pretend to care what I say to her ! You 're not being fair , Johnny ! - You shut up , too ! Pal , you 're angry with me , so take it out on me , not on them ! Yo , hero , read the middle finger . Johnny ! Wait ! Jesus . What the hell is wrong with him ? ! He 's so damned angry ! Jack , you know what 's wrong . Well , I 'm gonna make everybody 's day ! I won 't go Monday . I 'll go tomorrow . Then you can throw another party ! Come here . Come on . Milk ! Oh God , milk . Oh , wow . What are you doing ? Just ... just having some milk ... K - Kim . Do I know you ? I 'm Fred . Fred ... Fred Scarran . From the Gainesville Scarrans . We 're family . You do look a little like Johnny . I just saw him drive off in Betty . Where 's he going , the lake ? No , when he gets really steamed up , he heads down to the canal . Yeah . - It 's near ... No , I know where that is . I like ... that spot ... you know with ... the overhang ... the tall trees . - That 's my favorite place . Johnny hates it there . Yeah , I know . He shouldn 't . Milk ? Does a body good . Turn on the lights , or black out the whole city . " Made in France . " Look at this studio filled with fabulous prizes . - What the frell is that ? I have no idea . This sensational twenty ... What do you think this means ? ... beach party showcase . Well , it must be some kind of ... a greeting . Yeah , to a friend . ... hundred dollar strand of pearls . Hello , Wrinkles . ... thousand dollars just waiting to be won on ... Wheel of Fortune . And now here 's your host ... Wheel ... Nice truck . Betty . Who are you ? My name 's John . John Clarence . You know , you should go to the overhang more often . Kim likes it there . What the hell are you doing ? Just checking your suspension , bro . Need you to do me a favor . You have to talk to your father . I want him not to go up on the shuttle . Look , I don 't know who you are , but shove off . Hey ! Okay , we don 't hit . We may shoot people sometimes , but we don 't hit . Get off me , you ... - And no , I am not ... You got problems . You 're gonna outgrow most of 'em . And I know why you 're upset . You got no idea ! Yes , I do . You think he treats her badly . How do you know that ? Same way I know you helped D.K. cheat on his SATs . You wanna go to college , boy ? Convince your dad not to fly on the Challenger . You 're a spook , right ? Coming to test the family ? 'Cause if you guys knew anything , you 'd know I can 't convince my dad to do squat . You 're wrong . - You 're wrong . He never listens . Man , when you 're right , you 're right . D 'Argo , you should study this . " L , M , N , O , P , Q ... " Just a few of their words . Just in case . Chiana has already told me a few words . " Yes . " " No . " " Bite me . " That 's all I need to know . " R , S ... " S. This girl is slow . Why are you wearing that ? Come on . Aren 't you busting to get out ? We 're on Earth . It 's Crichton 's hometown . - John has told us to stay . - Again with the Cookie Monster . Crichton has gotten home . If you don 't screw this up , maybe one day he can get me home , too . - I don 't wanna wait for one day . - I wanna go exploring now . Chiana ! I am not permitting you to go . Can you keep it down ? I 'm trying to listen . You 're not the captain down here . It 's Halloween . I 'll fit in . Chiana , no ! - D 'Argo , no ! Don 't go out there ! ... Q , R , S , T , U , V ... - ... W , X , Y and Z ... - What is this ? I love you . I love you , too . Uh-oh . Pilot , there 's no need for a complete shutdown . Turn up the heat . Scorpius . Sikozu . We 've got trouble . Get up here . Peacekeeper Marauders are approaching at maximum speed . Grayza and Braca are aboard . - Well , Starburst . No , if Moya does , she will never find this wormhole 's exact location again . Crichton and the others ... Will be lost . We must go now . If you run , Grayza will assume Crichton is aboard and she will hunt you down . We let Grayza board . She will see Crichton is not here and ... She will kill me . If Crichton is not here , she will not hurt you , Pilot . ... our true love Dreams that come and go - Hey , nice outfit . Goin ' to a party ? Yeah . You wanna lift ? Sure . You can tell me ' bout the pain you feel ... the wounds will never heal , oh 'Cause love is blind You like that ? Don 't try to change my mind Cool . So what 's your name ? Chiana . Was it Karen ? - Love is blind Yeah . Yeah , Karen . - Love is blind Shee-aw . Karen Shaw , right ? The name 's John Crichton . 'Cause love is blind Crichton ? - Love is blind What 's the matter ? Drive . Drive . - It happens all the time Drive . - It 's not a crime 'Cause love is blind Looks like an enforcer . He has a weapon . D 'Argo , you should put this on , too . Aeryn knows enough English to get us through . Just remember the plan . Plan doesn 't work , we use force . It 'll be fine . Hello . Ma 'am . How can I help you ? Uh , well , this house was , uh ... Abandoned by our uncle . Would you like to come in ? Yeah , thanks . Oh . Listen , I 'm afraid I had a , uh ... A complaint from the lady . Yes , I think she was scared . She saw Kermit . We thought the batteries were dead , but it 's just a silly toy . Grandma , say excuse me . Okay , where are you from ? - Uh ... Whoa , whoa , whoa . Don 't move , pal ! It 's all right , he 's just my brother . It 's Hallowin , remember ? He 's , uh , he 's dressed up . In a mask . That 's a mask ? Yes , of course it is . You 're a little old to be dressing up for Halloween , aren 't you , pal ? No . Yes . Bite me . Okay , take off the mask , pal . Now ! Take off the mask ! Take off the mask ! It 's all right , okay . - Stand back ! Toy sword . - Excuse me . There is no danger here . See D 'Argo remove his mask . See the hoo-man you expect . Then go and leave us alone . Is there a problem , Officer ? Oh , no , no . No problem . No problem . I 'll just , uh ... I 'll just go , man , and , uh ... you guys ... You guys ... just , uh , you know , do your own thing . Happy Hallowin . Uh-huh . - Bye-bye . You bitch ! I think you broke a rib . - Shut up . Well , we 've done it now . I have to go and find Crichton . Thanks , ma 'am . Okay . Oh , man . Like those clothes . I hope this is all right . It 's all we could find . Well , you kinda look like Cher . Is that a good or a bad thing ? It works . How are things going here ? Uh , situation normal . It 's getting worse . Now my dad 's leaving tomorrow . Mom , I 'm going . Oh , hey ... Are you sure you don 't want me to drive you over ?

It 's a little strange . But tha-that 's why I 'm here . Um ... I did a reading in Gainesville , and I , uh , saw your husband . Jack ? Yeah . Don 't let him go tomorrow . Make him stay till Monday . I did a reading . I ... God ... is there something ... I don 't know . Just don 't let him go this weekend . Don 't ... Don 't back down like you always do . How do you know that ? It 's in your face . You 're a peacemaker . Not a fighter . Look , just ... just don 't let him go . I 'm sorry I bothered you . - Wait . Are you sure I don 't know you ? No . You don 't know me . " It even brought tears to my eyes ... " Just tell your father about the crash and he won 't go on the scuttle . Shuttle . No , he probably wouldn 't believe me . It 'd just make things worse . What do you wanna do ? 17 years ago , I got trapped in a fire . I was in a coma for two days . My dad saved me . Afterwards , when NASA called , he refused to leave . And you want to recreate that ? I wanna get as close as I can . I 'll get my old girlfriend to bring my ... self here . We 'll make sure my dad saves me , light a fire . I can help . I can simulate a coma so ... No , no , no , no , Grandma . You do not touch my body . Where 's Chiana ? Yeah , we used to get along . We did stuff . Now he just thinks we 're part of his crew or something . Fathers . You got trouble with yours ? Yeah . The joke is ... I wanna go up there , too , one day . You will . Nah , it 's too tough . It 's a total bitch . They only take the best . I don 't know . Maybe . One day . Hello , Cookie Monster . What are you doing ? He was snooping . I 'm running tests to make sure I don 't hurt Crichton if I put him into a coma . Look ... I can do anything to him . He doesn 't feel a thing . - Crichton told us not to make things worse . Get him out of there . Get him in . Helmet . Nearly lost him . Machine . Go . I think you might turn that . It 's all right . Mind your own business . Okay , prepare for engagement . Excuse me . Uh ... Activate the control collar . Moya doesn 't want a control collar . Please , we didn 't try to run . We didn 't St-Starburst . I told you I ... I have no idea where Crichton is . Braca , if Crichton is aboard this Leviathan , bring him to me . Yes , ma 'am . Commence a full tier search . I 'll start in the Neural Cluster . Well , I arranged it with Kim . I 'm gonna meet my young self at the canal tomorrow . What are you doing ? Cutting . Just cutting . Make them scary , you said . Scary . Ooh . - Hell , somebody got a sugar high . You 've been stealing candy , Mr. Burroughs ? Oh Crichton , how illegal is this dren ? You gotta get me more ! I don 't care what it costs . Buckwheat , breathe . Breathe . Get some sleep . You 've got a big day tomorrow . Okay , okay . Good idea . The Neural Turbines . They will hide our heat signatures . You go . Scorpius , we must hide until the Peacekeepers have gone . I 'll be fine . Go . Check Tier Nine . Yes , sir . I 'll go below . You ... you 're dead . How many aboard the Leviathan , Braca ? 30 Peacekeepers ... and Grayza . Will they follow you down here ? No . Lieuten ... I mean , Captain . Well done . It 's good to see you , sir . Good morning , Florida ! I hope you having a very scary Halloween . Chief . We 've been looking for you all night . I saw you with them . I don 't know what you saw , Dot . But I think I need a warrant . The charges are almost ready . It 'll create more smoke than fire . Your father will have a quarter of an arn to get you out . I 'll set a perimeter . Make sure we 're not interrupted . And I 've made enough syrup to keep the kid unconscious for three arns . Oh , don 't worry , I 've tested it on the enforcer so the boy won 't wake in the middle of the rescue . We 'll see . I 'll go get my ... self , and I 'll be right back . Mmm . You smell nice . Thank you . Well , what do the cards say ? Oh , you 're definitely staying . They look happy . I didn 't see my parents like that very often . - Now you pick one ? - This better be good . I never saw that in my sires . Definitely . - Oh , no , no . You just want ' em to stay like that . You know , they think they got all the time in the world . But pretty soon , it 's doctors . Tests ... Well , this one isn 't too bad . Kim . - Hey ! Hi . - Hey . Hi , I did what you told me . Johnny doesn 't wanna be here , but I told him we had to talk . He thinks I 'm breaking up with him . Yeah , well you will . What did you say ? Nothing . It 's just ... You know , a girl like you . Are you flirting with me ? Oh , no . Why would I do that ? No , I 'm just ... Hey ! Whoa ! What the hell did you do that for ? We 're in a hurry . So ... this is what ... what you 're into . She 's a nice girl . Well , if she 's really that nice , how about you take care of her and , uh , I 'll take care of him ? No questions asked . Trick or treat ! Trick or treat ! - Come in . Trick or treat ! - Over here . Trick or treat , money or eat . Cool toy . I did it . I got candy . I got it ! What the hell ? Rygel ! Stop doing that ! But I love this , and you-you ... you won 't buy me anymore . I want Kit Kat and MM 's and Pez and Reeses Pieces ! Crichton , please ! D , you 're all set ? Yeah , I 'm just priming the last charge . Hey , Norati . How much longer till ... till the syrup 's ready ? Half an arn . Can you keep him occupied ? I 'll think of something . I 'm sure you can , hmm . Okay . Garage . Yeah . - Yeah . This ... your ... first ? Is this how you ... you imagined it ? Not in Betty . I always thought it would be in my dad 's four-wheel drive . Does Grayza know you 're my spy ? No . But she 'll figure it out when she discovers you 're alive . She must never find that out . We 've got to stop her . She 's organizing a Peace Initiative with the Scarrans . They 're using her . They 'll agree to everything , then betray us , when their forces are battle ready . What shall I do ? Stall her , Braca . I 'm not given to exaggeration , but ... the future of Peacekeeper survival depends on you . I got the warrant . Let 's go search that house . Everything is set . You can do this ? No problem . Just make sure everyone stays out of sight until he drinks it . Hey . Here . It 's okay ? Yeah . - We 've got trouble . - Two enforcers . Stay down ! Hang on ! You 're the guy that ... Chiana , keep him down ! Crichton ? - What 's happening ? Crichton ! - What 's the matter ? Old woman ! Hey . - I thought she tested the stuff . Is this supposed to be happening ? No pulse . I 've got no pulse ! This is the police ! Open up ! Crichton ... Crichton , I know ... - What ? ! Your arm . - Police . Open the door . We have a warrant to search these premises . Open up the door ! - Open the door . - This is the police . Where 's Crichton ? I 'm here . I 've disappeared . Calm down . Everything 's under control . Under control ? I 'm gone ! What happens next , I lose my voice ? I wish . Keep your ... Keep it down . - This is the police . Open up . The Sheriff 's body weight must be greater so I gave the boy too much . Bring me back ! - Just bring him back . His body has stopped functioning and you are ceasing , wherever you are , to exist . We 're gonna have to let them in . Are you ready ? Yeah . Two of them . You take the big one . - Yeah . Hello . - Ma 'am . Hi . Hey ! Grandma , fix me . You 're just a nooky . Haven 't you ever died before ? Move . What are you doing ? Hey , is that it ? See ? Nothing to worry about . - Then why am I like this ? Well , I couldn 't bring him back too quickly so I don 't really know , but I think your semi-corporeality won 't last long , so why don 't you use your condition to our advantage . Fine . I 'll go get my dad . I 'm Casper the friggin ' joke . Who are you people ? Aliens . I 'm gonna set the charges for the smoke . Right . Let 's get him into the garage . Mom ... it 's me . Johnny ? I love you . I 've wanted to tell you that for a very long time . What 's the matter ? I 'm in trouble . I 'm in the Carson house . Get Dad and tell him to save me . Jack ! Jack ! Mom , listen . When you first feel the pain , don 't ... don 't wait . - The initial scans were accurate . - The Leviathan is empty . - I assumed as much . - I accessed the memory banks . The Pilot has no idea where Crichton 's gone . Braca , prepare the Marauders . Set course for our meeting with the Scarrans . Yes , ma 'am . You two , come with me . There 's no way that Moya can detect your presence . But Crichton 's DNA , which I provided for you , will enable you to detect his presence . So when he returns , as we know he will , capture him alive . Remember nothing . Hurry . Except for Karen Shaw , in the four-wheel drive . Remember nothing . Okay , we gotta go . Hey , Wrinkles , no , no , no . It 's time to go . No . The sheriff must forget . He must . - No , they 're coming . Come on . Is everyone else back on the ship ? Yes . Jack 's on his way . John ? ! John ? John ! Johnny ! Damn , he moves fast for an old guy . You 're back . Yeah , in more ways than one . - Hello ? Damn . She 's gonna screw things up . My dad has to do it by himself . Aeryn . John ? Where are you ? John , are you here ? John ? You know , if he stays in there too much longer it 's gonna catch on fire . Why do our plans never work ? Murphy 's Law . Son of a ... D ! I 'm gonna get myself . You take Dad . You all right ? I 'm still here . Try not to frown so much . Good luck . We 've gotta go . I 'll start Lo 'La . Yeah . All right . John ! Come on , pal . Breathe . Breathe . You 're gonna be okay . Jack ? ! Johnny ! - Talk to me . Come on . He 's all right . He 's okay . I think it 's time to go . Johnny ? Johnny , you okay ? I got no idea why nobody else remembers . I swear to God , I 'm telling the truth . There was , um ... this guy and he was invisible . And , um , this other thing that had this long tongue . He knocked me out with it . And they left this ... Um ... It 's as a sign . This has gotta be like a message or something . 'Cause no human could have made this . There 's no way a human could have made this . How is everything else on your planet ? We did okay . Is there any way we can save those people going aboard that doomed shuttle ? No . Time must play out . Crichton . Can you hear me ? Yes , Pilot . Where are you ? Where you said to be . Well , we 're scanning now and you 're not here . Yes , we are . No , you 're not . Pilot , listen up , this is important . What year is it where you are ? Transmission from your Earth indicates it 's 2003 . Follow my signal . Commander , come home . Okay , I 'm locking on now . Here it comes . By Lanet , another Earth . No . Same Earth , Sparky , just a different year . Welcome home , son . We 've been waiting for you a long time . What 's wrong , John ? Was it a bass or a trout ?

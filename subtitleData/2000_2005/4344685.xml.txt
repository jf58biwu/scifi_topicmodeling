 [ Phone Beeping ] - [ Ringing ] - [ Miss Parker ] What ? - [ Jarod ] Always the workaholic . - Jarod - Tormenting hours are from 9 : 00 to 5 : 00 . Call back tomorrow . Who said I was calling to torment you ? Maybe I was just feeling nostalgic . If you 're feeling homesick , come visit . I have a room all ready for you . Generous offer , but I will regretfully decline . So . What is it , Jarod ? I was hoping you 'd give my best to the rest of our dysfunctional family . Particularly Mr. Raines . Oh , I 'll be sure to say hey , next time I see him . When was the last time you saw him ? He hasn 't been around much lately , has he ? I count Raines 's absence as a blessing . I don 't question it . If you don 't question ... - you don 't learn . - [ Beeps ] I brought the Triumvirate phone logs you requested . Back burner , Broots . I have a holier crusade for you . Find out where Raines has been lately . [ Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] - [ Beeps ] - Hello ? Well , it 's about damn time . Tell me you found him . Look , I 'm paying you all this money ... 'cause you 're supposed to be on the inside . This boy should be dead by now . Bolton , Minnesota must be a podunk , nothing town . How hard can it be to find him ? Well , he goes to school , doesn 't he ? The clock is ticking . My new trial is in five days ... and this boy 's testimony is the only thing that they 've got on me . I want you to find him . I want you to kill him . Otherwise , you 're dead . Got me ? Don 't let me down . What 's the problem , buddy ? You in some kind of hurry ? Yeah . As a matter offact , I am . [ Bell Ringing ] [ Chattering ] - [ Claps ] - Good morning , class . My name is Mr. Brodie . I 'm your substitute teacher . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . - [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . - [ Jarod ] Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . Mr. Conklin , your regular teacher ... is on vacation , so before we get started ... I 'd like to get to know all of you a little bit better . - Do you know about sex ? - [ Laughter ] Mr. Conklin said we 're gonna start our sex education this week . - My mom signed a permission slip . - Kevin - Interested in biology . Good . [ Boy ] I already know about sex . - My dad has the Internet . - Joel - Likes computers . Mr. Brodie ? Are you married ? Uh , no , uh , Gemma . - I 'm not . - Do you have a girlfriend ? - Yeah . Does she know about sex ? - [ Laughter ] I 'm the one that 's supposed to be asking the questions , remember ? What about you , uh , Matthew ? - What are you interested in ? - Uh - I like to read , I guess . You like to read . That 's a good thing . And you , uh , Eric . What are your interests ? Cool stuff . Espionage . Counterintelligence . You know , I could tell you more , but , uh , I 'd have to kill you . [ Laughter ] Eric 's a freak ! He can 't even write . - It 's all gibberish . - It 's not gibberish , Joel . It 's asecret code , so knuckle-dragging mopes ... - like you can 't read it . - Oh , yeah ? It 's probably a love letter to your girlfriend Molly over there . [ Laughter ] All right . Can we , uh , get back on track here ? - [ Laughing , Chattering ] - Uh , class . - Class . - [ Laughing , Chattering Continue ] Enough ! [ Whistles ] Could you cut me a little slack here ? It 's not easy being the new kid in school . I 'll bet some of you know about that . Tell me something . How many of you were born here ? How many of you spent your whole life in Bolton ? Mr. Brodie ? I was born here , but my brother wasn 't . Okay . And how many of you have brothers and sisters ? - Does this mean we 're not gonna learn about sex ? - [ Laughter ] [ Woman ] It was a child 's eyewitness testimony ... that sealed Esposito 's fate to a life in prison . However , just last month the court granted Esposito a new trial ... based on a procedural technicality . The charges against Esposito stem from the brutal murder ... of a Brooklyn shop owner . According to police , Esposito bludgeoned and then buried the victim 's body ... unaware the crime was being witnessed by a fifth grader ... on a field trip from nearby Woodbury Elementary School . What 's our rule about other people 's things ? - Excuse me . - Those aren 't your files , are they ? Uh , no , but there was nobody in the office so I just - Our rule about other people 's things is , " we don 't touch them . " - I understand , but there was - - Butts belong in ashtrays , mister . It 's all right , Mrs. Warner . Jarod 's our new sixth grade teacher . I 'll expect those back , young man . Don 't worry about Mrs. Warner . She 's a lifer . - A lifer ? - Been here 32 years . Teaching a 10-year-old is the only language she knows . Kind of scary , isn 't it ? Just like being in grade school all over again . Or for the very first time . Hi . - Hi . - Jarod , Rachel Daly , our student counselor . Jarod 's taking over the sixth graders while Mr. Conklin 's in Hawaii . You believe Conklin 's luck ? He 's always been talking about Hawaii ... and out of nowhere he wins a trip . Said he didn 't even remember entering the contest . - Hmm . Unbelievable . - Well , if you 'll excuse me ... I 've got a fourth grader who is habitually pulling fire alarms . - Nice to meet you , Jarod . - Nice to meet you . Principal Bauer , while I 've got you here - I have a student in my class - Uh , Matthew Reese . His records only go back 11 months , and before that ... - it 's like he doesn 't exist . - Matthew only moved here last year . But even still , wouldn 't his old school transfer the records over ? Normally , but according to his mom , his last school had a fire . All the files were destroyed . Well . I guess that explains it . [ Miss Parker ] Raines has been going to an insane asylum ? Uh , the Pratt Institute . It 's about an hour south of here . He 's been going a couple of times a day . Look . There he is . - Cue men with big butterfly nets . - No , no . He 's not a patient . He 's visiting someone . There 's a woman . A woman who means something to Jarod . - The question is , who is she ? - [ Sydney ] My God . Sydney ? - [ Sydney ] It 's Edna Raines . - Raines 's wife ? - It 's impossible . - Kick the rock over , Syd . What am I not seeing ? Edna Raines committed suicide more than 20 years ago . Or so you were told . - Broots , get a town car . - No , it 's too late . The guy at the hospital told me she escaped last night . [ Children Laughing , Chattering ] Okay , a teacher 's pay is one thing , Jarod ... [ Laughing ] but eating the school lunch - - What , do you have a death wish ? - I was intrigued . A tube of processed meat covered by a deep-fried carbohydrate ... and skewered with a stick so that it 's fully portable . - Sort of a meat Popsicle . - Is that your first corn dog ? - Mmm . Good . - [ Laughs ] You 're much braver than I am . I 've noticed that Matthew doesn 't socialize much ... with the other children . Are there any issues about him I should know about ? Matthew 's been a little slow assimilating since he transferred here ... but some kids are just like that . - Why the interest ? - I just figure the more I know about my kids ... the more I can help them . [ Esposito ] Three days and counting . I don 't want to hear you 're getting close . I want to hear that this kid is dead . If you can 't figure out which boy it is and get this job done ... then I 'm gonna come do it myself . You better worry that I just don 't bury you with him . [ Doorbell Rings ] - Hello . - Hi . My son said that there was a new teacher in town ... so I wanted to bring you a little something to say welcome . - That 's very nice . Thank you . - Oh ! It 's hot . I 'd probably better do this . I know what it 's like to be new in town . Matthew and I just moved here ourselves last year . You said , uh , Matthew . Matthew Reese ? Oh ! I 'm his mom . I didn 't say that , did I ? - No . - No . [ Laughs ] Where did you two move here from ? From back East . [ Doorbell Rings ] Excuse me . - Hello . - Uh , hello . - Hello , Justine . - Hello , Gail . - You two know each other ? - Yeah . We 're in the same single moms cooking group here in town . Oh , uh - Mmm . [ Doorbell Rings ] [ Jarod ] It 's pretty cool , huh ? You can see a whole world of things that are too small to see with your human eye . Hey , maybe we can use it to see Eric 's tiny little brain . - [ Laughter ] - Mr. Brodie , how do they swim around like that ? That 's a very good question . Why don 't you all read chapter four and find out ? - [ Students Groaning ] - I lost that book . [ Chuckles ] Get to work . - It 's pretty neat , huh ? - Yeah . But I 've seen protozoans and stuff before . We had microscopes in the science room at my old school . - Did you like your old school ? - I guess . Must have been pretty tough - leaving your old friends like that . Mom said we didn 't have a choice . We had to move . - I 'm not really supposed to talk about it . - [ Bell Ringing ] Come on , Joel . That 's for my eyes only . Oh . I 'm sorry , dude . Here . [ Laughs ] - This is sweet . - It 's way over your head . Oh , yeah ? Let 's find out . Hi . I 'm Eric Gantry , and I 'm a scrawny little freak ... and I 'm so madly in love with Molly . [ Joel On Recorder ] Hi . I 'm Eric Gantry , and I 'm a scrawny little freak ... and I 'm so madly in love with Molly . What 's our rule about other people 's things , Joel ? - What ? - We do not touch them . Pretty manly , freak - Always having a teacher rescue you . It seems he has it in for you . It 's no big deal . What 's a secret agent without an archenemy , right ? Just forget about it . - Hey ! - [ CarStarts ] - [ Tires Screeching ] - Hey ! [ Sydney ] I still can 't believe Edna 's alive . [ Miss Parker ] You sound as if you liked her , Syd . Very much so . You see , Edna was not like so many company wives . There was something more alive about her . There 's also something familiar about her . She was working as a physician , right here at the Centre ... - in the staff dispensary . - Right . In fact , I think she saw me when I had the mumps . - Your mother trusted her completely . - She did ? Edna , you see , had many admirable qualities . She was as vocal in community politics ... as she was at Centre cocktail parties . How did she end up marrying Raines ? After the murder of their daughter , Edna fell apart . I was told she took an overdose of barbiturates . I was at the funeral , Parker . I wonder what 's really buried out there in the Centre cemetery . I 've got Broots out hunting for Edna . [ Sydney ] Raines must be doing the same . I think it 's testing his new-found innerpeace . - [ Knocking ] - Not a word to anyone , Sydney . Good night . Broots , tell me something good . Oh , it 's so good to see you again , Catherine . - [ Bell Ringing ] - Great little town like Bolton - Never thought we 'd have sickos hanging around our school . Did you get a good look at him ? - No , and he didn 't stick around for questions . - Reminds me . Kids are having a big dance on Friday - Sadie Hawkins - in light of yesterday , I 'd feel better if we had another chaperone there . Oh . I look forward to it . And I can 't wait to meet this Miss Hawkins . Wait , honey . Forgot your lunch . Remember , I 'm working late , okay ? So leftovers for dinner . - Bye . - Excuse me , Mrs. Gantry . My name is Jarod Brodie . I 'm Eric 's new teacher . I was wondering if I could talk to you about some trouble he 's having . Oh , you mean Joel ? Yeah , Eric told me about what happened yesterday . Joel is a bit of a problem . But you think Eric 's all right otherwise ? - " Otherwise " ? - Oh , you know , I just worry , that 's all . You know , with this whole " secret agent " ... spy game of his . Pretending isn 't so bad . Yeah , as long as he 's not hiding in it . But it is the sixth grade . I 'm probably just being silly . Hey , it 's not silly to care about your son . I 'll have a talk with him . - [ Bell Ringing ] - Thank you . Excuse me , Mrs. Warner . The parking sticker you gave me - I can 't find it anywhere . I must have lost it . Boys - They 'd lose their heads if they weren 't attached . Well , technically , lack of cranial attachment ... would nullify all other motor skills , therefore the notion - Uh , if it helps , I believe it was sticker number 48 . No , Mr. Brodie , you had 55 . Number 48 belongs to Larry Grasso , our janitor . Thank you . Mr. Brodie ! Hi . Matthew forgot his lunch . So , I have just been dying to know ... what you thought of my risotto . Actually , I was - I was going to call you . Really ? The other evening , when I was asking you the questions ... about where you used to live - I know why you were dodging them . Did - Did I give you that impression ? Gail , I know why you and Matthew had to move here . You can trust me . Really . You have no idea how hard it 's been ... keeping this a secret and living this lie . I mean , I-I thought that he was a nice guy . You know , I had no idea about the hidden camera . I guess everyone 's got the Internet these days . - And - And before you knew it - - You never lived in Woodbury ? There was no testimony , no trial ? Trial ? [ Sydney ] How is Edna ? As vacant as the Bates Motel . Edna ? Do you remember me ? We were colleagues at the Centre ... - many , many years ago . - Sydney . That 's right . You do remember . Edna ? Edna , can you hear me ? Forget it , Syd . She 's been clap-on , clap-off all afternoon . Twenty years of sedation must have taken a damaging toll on her brain . But something brought her here - Something brought her here looking for my mother . - What ? - Let 's try and find out . Well , there 's only one reason the Centre would have gone to ... such lengths to keep her quiet . She knows their dirty little secrets . I want to know them too . Even if Edna were lucid ... she may not have the capacity to tell you . Well , this dig isn 't over . Takes one to know one , right ? Maybe we should pass the shovel to Angelo ... and see what he can find in there . [ Eric ] Tough day , huh ? - I 'm afraid so , Eric . - Did you just get some bad news ? Yeah . Wow . That 's some pretty sophisticated spy equipment you got there . What 's that thing ? Hey , look at this - An operative 's communicator . - You know , so my superiors can contact me . - When you 're on a mission . Eric , Joel was kind of a jerk yesterday ... the way he was making fun of you in front of everybody like that . I try not to let him get to me . I don 't really care what he or any of the other non-operatives think . Except for Molly , right ? I see the way you look at her . That 's supposed to be top secret . Again , stupid Joel compromised everything . Check this out . I keep all my secrets in here . You don 't exactly have the proper clearance ... but , uh , I 'll make an exception . Whoa . - A surveillance photo . Nice going . - She probably hates me . Nah . No , you got that dashing spy-thing going on . Girls love that . - Still , what do I do ? - Well , if I were you , I would just ... face it head on and tell her how you feel . Noway . Suicide mission . When you care about somebody , you 've gotta tell them ... while you 've got the chance . I wouldn 't know what to say . Here . Practice into this thing , and when you get it right ... tell her . [ Bell Ringing ] Mr. Brodie ? Thanks . You 're the first friend I 've made since I came here . [ Eric 's Voice ] You 're the first friend I made since I came here . [ Jarod 's Voice ] How many of you spent your whole life in Bolton ? [ Eric ] I keep all my secrets in here . [ Thinking ] Woodbury . Eric is the witness . Mrs. Warner , have you seen Eric Gantry ? He was talking to the janitor a few minutes ago . Then I saw him walking home . - Damn it . - Mr. Brodie ! This is Agent X-4 checking in . Eric ! Eric ! [ Tires Screeching ] Eric ! Eric ! What happened ? Where 's Eric ? I was trying to help the kid . - You 're a U.S. marshal . - There 's a leak inside Witness Protection . I was just about to pull Eric in . - They 're gonna kill him if you don 't stop them . - Who ? - Who shot you ? - Didn 't see him . Gotta be Esposito 's inside man . You hang on . I 'm going to get some help . Save Eric . The killer knows where he lives . Don 't let him go home , Jarod . Don 't let him go home . - Operative 's communicator . - So my superiors can contact me . [ Beeping ] [ Beeping ] - [ Muffled Cries ] - Shh , shh . It 's me . Come on . Back to my house . Let 's get your mom . When I heard that animal got out , I was , uh - I was so scared . But then Witness Protection called and they said not to worry ... that they were sending someone out to keep an eye on us . The janitor . Esposito 's man already got to him . My God . They gave me a number to call in case of an emergency . You can 't . There 's a leak inside the agency . It 's not safe . Okay . Okay , so what do we do ? We call the police ? My gut says that we stay under everybody 's radar - at least for tonight . Sit down and try to relax . Mr. Brodie , I am so , so sorry ... that I lied in class when you asked who 's lived here a long time . I mean , they told me that sometimes I had to lie . - It 's not like I wanted to . - Eric - You did the right thing . - Mom , I 'm done . - Okay , honey . Hey . There 's eight cartons of ice cream in the freezer . After your homework . - He 's a terrific kid . - Yeah . You two have been through a lot . Yeah , but he 's just a boy , and he deserves a childhood ... surrounded by family and friends ... and instead he was hustled away in the middle of the night ... taken away from everything . It 's not fair . I know . At least he has his mother to take care of him . My little man . I don 't deserve him . I really don 't . Saw the murder - His class was going on a field trip ... and Eric woke up with some sniffles and a fever coming on ... and I really should have kept him home ... but I didn 't . - See , I had made plans that day . - What happened wasn 't your fault . I am his mother . I 'm supposed to keep him safe and happy , and he 's neither . And the worst part is ... that once the new trial starts , it 's gonna start all over again . [ Sydney ] Quietly , Angelo . I 'm taking you to see a friend of mine - Edna . - Sydney 's friend dead . - No , she 's very much alive . No . Dead inside . That is why I need your help , Angelo . Got it ? - Working late , Sydney ? - Isn 't it past Bonzo 's bedtime ? I have this idea ... that Angelo might be able to empath ... - Jarod 's next move . - Your idea will have to wait . Angelo 's skills are required in another pursuit at the moment . That a problem ? No , of course not . Come on , monkey boy . [ Eric ] Mom , what 's gonna happen to us ? I don 't know , kiddo . We may have to play it fast and loose again . Mom , I can 't leave . Not yet . Honey , I don 't know that we have a choice . - Mom , please . There 's something I have to do . - Baby , I 'm so sorry . This never should have happened to you . Now try and get some sleep . Okay ? So what now ? The marshal said that Esposito 's man is someone inside the school . I find him before he finds us . [ Beeping ] Mrs. Raines , that monster ... you 're married to has kept you doped up for the last 20 years . Why ? What did you know ? So good to see you again , Catherine . That 's right . I 'm Catherine , your friend . I 'm here to help you , but you need to help me too . So good to see you again , Catherine . And I know you came here to see me for a reason . Please ... tell me what it is . So good to see you again , Catherine . Look . I 'm not Catherine . All right ? Catherine 's been dead a very long time . Do you hear me ? [ Groans ] I 'm not my mother . How are your mumps , little Miss Parker ? You remember . Edna , please - Tell me why you came here to see me . - Mirage . - " Mirage . " What is mirage ? What your mother started . Work she hoped you 'd finish . What kind of work ? Edna ? Edna ? Edna , stay with me . Rachel . " Rachel Daly . Chicago field office . " Federal marshal , Witness Protection Division . - Current assignment : On leave . " - [ Beeping ] Rachel Daly . Rachel Daly , the school counselor ? She 's a Witness Protection agent from out of state . - But why would she do that ? - Money . Eric 's testimony ... is the only thing that could put Esposito back in prison . - Where is he ? - Uh , he 's still sleeping . I didn 't want to wake him till I had to . We have to get you two out of town . I 'll deal with Rachel later . Oh , my God , they got him . Eric ! - Eric ! - No . This wasn 't forced open . It was unlocked from the inside . But why ? Where would he go ? - [ School Bell Ringing ] - [ Chattering ] # [ Pop On P.A. ] Hey . Hi . Uh , Molly ... can I talk to you for a sec ? There 's somewhere I have to go . You know , it 's a secret mission ... but I didn 't want to leave before I told you something . Yeah ? What ? All year long , I - No . No , I 'm sorry . That 's not what I meant . Here . Uh , can you just listen to this ? - Please ? - Sure . Sorry to interrupt your love connection ... but you already got a date-with my fist . Eric . Just the young man I was looking for . Why don 't you come with me ? There 's someone here to see you . Hey there , buddy . Remember me ? Eric ! Eric ! [ Jarod ] Molly . - Have you seen Eric Gantry ? - That jerk Joel chased him that way . Eric ! Eric ! Oh , my God . She has him . Jarod , what are we gonna do ? - Where could they have taken him ? - Wait a minute . - Smart boy , Eric . - [ Tape Rewinding ] - [ Eric On Tape ] Leave me alone . - [ Esposito ] Shut up . My God . - Where are you taking me ? - Don 't worry , kid . It 's a short walk . - Sorry I didn 't bring a hard hat . - [ Daly ] Come on , Eric . - Let me go ! - Call the police . [ Eric ] Come on ! I swear to God , I will not testify against you . - Please let me go ! - Sorry , kid , but as long as you 're alive ... you stand to seriously foul up my life . - Get in the hole . - No ! Be a good boy , Eric , and do as he says . Both of you . Why don 't you fill it yourself ? Thank God , Jarod . - I saw him dragging Eric here and I didn 't - - I know , I know . You know something ? I don 't think this hole is full enough . Oh ! - You okay ? - Uh , yeah . - Good . You go take care of your mom now . Go . - Okay . It 's kind of fitting , don 't you think ? You 've gotten yourselves into a hole ... you can 't get out of . - Jarod , come on . - Come on . We were just talking to that kid . Oh , yes , like the way she was just talking ... to that federal marshal - when she murdered him ... or the way you were just talking to the shop owner ... two years ago when he was bludgeoned to death . Oh . Whoa , whoa . What are you doing ? Jarod ? - Jarod , what are you doing ? - He 's crazy . Eric was just a boy . All he wanted was his childhood - to be with his family , to play with his friends . But you took all that away from him . In an instant , everything he knew was just taken away . Well , now it 's your turn to disappear ... and no one will ever miss you . Okay , I did sell Eric out ... and I did shoot the marshal , but I can help you out . - I can testify against Esposito . - Shut up ! I don 't know . Why don 't you offer her some more money , Esposito ? - You 're insane . You can 't do this . - Who the hell are you ? I 'm just a guy who 's digging your grave . Oh , that 's right-You two already dug it . I 'm just filling it in . You better talk quick . This stuff dries fast . All right ! All right , I did it ! I said I did it . - Come again ? - I killed the shop owner . I hired her to kill the kid . Is that what you want to hear ? - Yes . As a matter of fact , it is . - [ Tape Rewinding ] [ Esposito On Tape ] I killed the shop owner and I hired her to kill the kid . Is that what you want to hear ? You 're still going to disappear - Both of you . - [ Daly ] What are you doing ? - [ Esposito ] I gave you what you wanted . [ Daly , Esposito Shouting ] - Jarod ! You can 't just leave us in here . - Wait ! Wait ! Jarod ! What about Mirage ? Anything yet ? Uh - [ Clears Throat ] Well , I 've , uh - I 've scanned the D.S.A. file directory , and - The headlines , Broots . Not the fine print . No . Nothing on Mirage . Maybe it 's just nonsense . I mean , this lady is a little whacked-out . Most of the time , yeah , but not when she said Mirage . I know it . - So - - It 's back to the salt mines for me . [ Bell Ringing ] Come on , Joel . What did you bring for me today , freak ? What 's this ? Brownies ? Oh . Don 't , Joel . You 'll be sorry . Oh , I haven 't been sorry yet . [ Snickers ] Mmm ! Mmm ! That 's good . Too bad your mother didn 't make you any , freak . Patience . It won 't be long , with the amount ... of prune extract we put in ' em . I would say right ... about ... now . [ Rumbling ] I wonder what came over him . Something he ate , maybe ? Hmm . [ Laughing , Chattering ] No ! Well , Agent Gantry , mission accomplished . Mission accomplished . [ Bell Ringing ] Excuse me . Seen the paper this morning ? Now , I can 't understand ... how they got the story , and yet there 's not one mention about the guy ... - who made it all happen . - Teaching can be such a thankless profession . Not entirely . - Thank you , Jarod . - Thanks , Mr. Brodie . Eric , can I talk to you for a sec ? I listened to your tape . It was sweet . I 'm really glad you gave it to me . - Really ? - Mm-hmm . So I was wondering - Do you want to go to the Sadie Hawkins dance with me tomorrow night ? Yeah ! I-I mean - - Of course I do . - Good . I 'll ... see you in class . Mom , we don 't have to leave tonight , do we ? Does a certain secret agent have one last rendezvous ? Yeah . [ Miss Parker ] She okay , Sam ? She went and laid down . I haven 't heard a word from her . Mrs. Raines ? Edna ? [ Whispering ] Oh , man . Now we 're left empty-handed . Not exactly . I still have Mirage . # Kri kra toad 's foot # # Geese walk barefoot # [ Vehicle Approaching ] # Kri kra toad 's foot - # [ Edna ] # Kri kra toad 's foot # # Geese walk barefoot # #

 If anyone finds this letter .. it means that my plan didn 't work .. and that I 'm already dead . But if I can somehow go back to the beginning of all this I might be able to save her . Evan ! We 're going to be late again . Since when do you care about going to school on time ? Don 't worry , we 've prenty of time . Is dad going to come ? You know the answer to that . Can he just come out for one day ? We 've been over this a hundred times . It 's too dangerous for him . But Lenny said his dad is coming .. and Tommy 's and Kelly 's Dad . Ok I get the point ! I 'm not so bad , am I ? No . Ok ! Have a good day . I will pick you up later . Got to go . Bye ! bye ! Mrs. Treborn , I need to speak to you . Can we just wait till tonight ? I 'm already late for work and I ... I think you really need to see this . Tommy ! Leave Lenny alone ! Don 't let me send you to Mr Voyteck office ! I was going to show this to the principal .. but I thought I 'll talk to you first . What is it ? Yesterday , I had the children to draw whatever they wanted to be when they grow up . Most of them made drawings of their parents . But this .. I don 't understand ? Evan did this ? Can I keep this drawing ? Of course . Umh .. there is one more thing Mrs Treborn I feel bad not mentioning . What ? When I asked Evan about the drawing .. well .. he couldn 't remember doing it . I don 't wanna go . I don 't like this place Mom , it 's creepy . I promises I won 't make any bad pictures . We 'll be fine OK.He just want to do a couple to tests . That 's all . You 'll like him . You 're doing great . Just tell me he has not inherited his father 's illness . I 'm sure the results will come back negative . But there is something else you can do to monitor his memory . Anything . A journal . Just get him to write down everything that he does . And what would that do ? It could help to jock his memory . .. See if he could remember anything new the next day . This test result will come back in a few days .. and then we 'll take it from there . OK Today , mommy is taking me to play with Kelly and Tommy . I 'll meet their father and see what a real dad is like . Great ! See you soon . Evan ! Evan . What are you doing with that knife ? What happened ? Honey .. .. what were you doing with that knife ? I don 't remember . Hey Andre . George ! Hello little man . Watch your steps . Thanks George . Not a problem . Here 's my number at the hospital .. if there is any problem . You know . You 're kidding ! We 're gonna have a great time today . Right sport ? OK ! Be good kiddo . I love you . Bye bye . Bye George . Go .. go on . Right at the back yard . Here it comes . Evan , Evan guess what ? Dad got a new video camera .. and we 're all gonna be in the movie . That 's right Evan .. and you .. got to be the star . I thought I was the star ! Hey ! What did I tell you ? Now Evan . .. you have to promise .. you 're the bestest super-doper promise .. that this will be our little secret . Huh huh . My boy ? Where am I ? Where did we all go ? Calm down kid and stand still . I was just somewhere else . How did I get here ? Stop acting like some retard or I 'll call your mother .. to tell her how a naughty little shit you have been . Kelly ? Kelly ? What happened ? The good news is , the result is negative . I found no evidence of legends , hemorrhages , tumors .. There must be sometime you can work on ? If I were to guess .. I 'll say the blackouts are stress related . But he 's seven years old . What kind of stress a seven year old can have ? Plenty . Maybe he has severe coping problem of not having a father . You said the last time the blackout occurred he was visiting his friend 's dad . Well .. he has been pushing me to meet his father .. and I 've been putting it off . It 's worth a short Andrea . We can arrange controlled meeting . .. some security , Evan comes for a quick visit , and with a little luck , .. no more missing father complex . April fifteen . Today I got to meet my father . His name is Jason and he 's crazy . I hope he 'll let me call him Dad . Dad lives here ? Not in this wind . Actually no . If you seems a little sleepy it 's because of the medicine , OK ? OK . It 'll just be a moment . It 's OK I 'll won 't bite . You 've seen pictures of me , right ? Uh huh . Mom says I have your smile .. and your hair . I 'll kill you ! He 'll have to die ! It 's the only way ! Jason ! No ! No ! It 's gonna be alright it 's gonna be alright . Come on . Let 's get him outta here . I 'm sorry Evan . .. in certain hope the resurrection to eternal life we command our mighty God , our brother Jason . May Lord bless him and keep him The Lord make light to shine upon him , .. and be gracious onto him .. and give him peace . Amen . Come on , where is it ? I know it 's down here somewhere . Tell me what shit , it 's so boring . Ya , what are you looking for anyway ? Shutup loud ass . You hold your fucking horses . It 's here somewhere . We should go though . If Dad catch us smoking down here , we 're dead . Lets go . I knew Dad has a blockbuster down here . Lets blow the shit out of something . Here you go buddy . What dreaming man , I 'm not touching this thing . Anyone else would piss out , and nuts for sure . It can 't work this time buddy , Look how small this fuse is . I 'll get killed . Not necessary .

Why is he not speaking ? Shock mdm . What is it ? What happened ? We were just in the wood building a fire when Lenny freak out . One minute he was OK and then he just froze up . Right guys ? What happened Evan ? The truth . I dunno , I .. I don 't remember . Something must have happened . Something set him up . I blanked out . Don 't try to get your blackout to get out of this one . You 're not making it up ? I don 't know . They are keeping him under observation at night I don 't know what to do with him . " The last thing I remember before the blackout is holding my hands over Kayleigh ears . I think I was more foucs on her hands on mine ... than on mail across the street . Mum thinks hypnosis made take away remember what . " Damn . Jason Treborn . What the hell ! Certificate of Death . My grandfather was crazy too ? Breath in .. and breath out .. and relax . You are completely asleep . Relaxed . I want you to take me to the time when you are in the woods with Lenny . Think of it like a movie . You can pause , .. rewind .. or slow down any details you wish . Yes . Where are you now ? I 'm standing next to Kelly , my hands are over her ears . Are you hurting her ? No , I 'm protecting her . OK . Lets move forward in time . What do you see ? I see a car . Yes Evan .. tell me about the car . Go on .. nothing can hurt you Remember , it 's only a movie . You 're completely safe . I can 't . The car vanishes , all of a sudden I 'm on the ground in the woods . The car isn 't varnished Evan . The movie in your head is broken , that 's all . Tell me about the car . I can 't . It 's coming ... Hurry Evan , hurry ! It 's coming ! Oh my God ! On the count of ten , you 're going to wake up , .. feeling your flesh , .. and everything you talked about . Make it stop !

Are you OK ? Holly shit ! Look at that fat fuck ! Shut up baggard . Who 's talking to you ? I 'm sorry Kelly this is a really bad idea . You don 't really remember anything that happened ? You 're so lucky . Look , everything is going to be OK . Lenny will be fine .. you 'll see . Sorry . It 's not your fault . It 's Kagan called Dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny . Your Dad did that ? I deserve a lot worst . What are you talking about ? What you deserve is a better father and brother . What they do is make you feel like shit . You have no clue as to how beautiful you are , do you ? What the fuck are you doing ? Buying popcop , what the fuck are you doing ? Ops ... .. Stop it ! Stop hitting him ! What 's wrong with you ? Will somebody please help us ? Now OK kid .. you 're outta here . Now another story . The peaceful town of BrayerVille was rocked this afternoon in the wake of an horrible act of vandalism . While the police of upstate New York believes this could be a simple case of act of mischief gone array .. the tragedy has definitely devastated the community . Now this is the grisly aftermath of an powerful explosion believed to have been caused by an unknown quantity of dynamite . Police has no leaks , no suspects , and no motive for the ... Good night . We 're moving . Even Tommy is so pissed at me . He knows I 'm moving right ? He 's acting real strange lately . He don 't even look me at the eyes anymore . Dart , here he comes . Did you mom says that Lenny is OK ? It must be .. I mean , they let him out right ? Welcome home . Though you might to have some fresh air for a change . Tommy with you guys ? No .. it 's cool . So what did you do in there ? It 's awful ! Can 't sleep cause everybody screaming all night long . I don 't want to go back . Did you see that ? Ya ... what 's with the smoke ? Croquette ! What are you doing with my dog ? Look at what you make me do ! ? What the hell 's wrong with you ? Kelly ! Come on , please wake up ! Wake up please ! Wake up ! Why don 't you fucking kiss her you Price Charming . How long was I out ? Kelly , what 's wrong ? ooh Croquette ! I 'm sorry . And time .. put your pencils down and place your blue books on my desk before you leave . You too Mr. Nelson , we 're all on the same time-zone here . So how did do Evan ? I don 't know , may get some names sorted out . Was it Pavlov that conditioned his dog to lick his nuts ? You 're a major , wise-ass . And how 's you project been coming ? You still planning to change .. the way we humble scientists view memory differently ? Don 't really have a choice . Jesus , must be truly an ass . Arlette , this is my well-mannered roommate , Evan . Ya .. You 're the man that fuck up the grade of a man at the anthropology final . See you later Tombeur . Bye . Ah ... sweet girl . Here 's you shirt bro . Sick fuck . Alright man , get dressed . You 're taking me out . Why , you just make another mid-term ? No . Better than that ! Seven years no blackouts . Fuck you bro , let do this . Be gentle with me , be gentle . Nice . Look at that fucking guy . Fuck out of my bar . So which one of you have the pet worm ? Worms .. pural . Ah ... that 's so gross . Talk to him about it . He got the fetish . Watch it . That psychoon project actually study how memory lost . That 's explain for all the excitement that I had . Ten bucks says he 'll eat it out of the floor . Well , like to figure out how the memory in the simple worm functions to help me understand the complexity of the human brain . Let me take a shot . What the fuck weirdo ? Well , this not your game . Smell like a sex in here . Yeah .. Tombeur has a busy day today . You kidding . This is so big . Yeah ? Well I guess charisma and I let it go all the way . You want a beer ? Ya . You got any incest or scent candles or anything ? Wo .. no .. Most guys just put porn books under their bed all you got are comp books ? Yeah .. they 're my journals . Something I begin since I was seven . Read me something . Maybe I 'll get some fun out of this . Here we go ? Looks like my mind refuses to believe what I 'm seeing . .. hearing Croquette make those awful screams . Just writing about it gives me the shivers . Come on . Go on . It was kinda like Tommy was possessed or something . There was a hate in his eyes and ? Are you OK ? Where am I ? What 's the hell is going on ? I can 't get it opened . Drop it ! Or I 'll slick your mother 's throat while she 's asleep . I get hold of Tommy ... save Croquette ! Listen to me Evan .. you listen to me good . There is a million other sisters in the world why do you have to fuck with mine ? It 's OK , it 's just a dream . Didn 't feel like a dream .

Just some details on how I couldn 't cut the robe . Ya . .. that 's good . Anything else ? Drop it or I 'll cut your mother 's throat when she 's asleep ! Jesus Christ . It really happened . Wow .. er Make one peek , .. and I 'll swear you be last one fucker . The last thing I remember before the blackout I cup my hands over Kelly 's ears . I think I was more focused on her hands on mine than on the mailbox .. across the street . Maybe it went out . Someone check it ? Yeah , you do that Lenny . Be cool peek to be the last one fucker . How is my sweet girl ? How is my sweet girl ? You got the hic don 't you ? You want to open it ? You want to ... Oh my God ! Shit ! Come on ! Fuck , Lenny come on ! Lenny come on !

I 'm .. look I 'm really sorry about that .. It took me over an hour to clean up the mess you made . Can .. can I just talk to Lenny ? Don 't call here . Mom . I can 't help it , I 'm just so proud of you . Dad er .. Did Jason get good grades ? He got straight As without touching the books . It 's one area where memory never fails him . Did he ever say like he figured out a way to recall his lost memories ? Years after the blackout happened ? Why you asked ? No , I just figured being just a brain and all . Looks like I would think that he would figure out a way to remember stuff that he forgot . Well , he was at your age , .. he said he figured out a way he could remember his past . I could tell if they were real memories or just his imagination . Then , just before he got so bad , he .. um .. has to be institutionised . He said he could ... What ? What ? What did he do ? Forget it . It 's nothing . He was far to sick by then . Come on , mum , what did he said that I get there ? What he said as goof ? No , Mum , come on . Come on son , it will be fun . All right it 's your dough . Give me your hand , young man . So this is the trick . Have you ever have your palm hand read before ? No , it 's the first time , so be gentle please . What ? You have no life line . You don 't belong here . For 5 bucks more she spits on your face . No , really , what 's his future ? He has no soul ! You were never meant to be . Psychic , right ? Then this it 's not a surprise for you . Thank you . No problem . When did you start smoking again ? Leave on , Evan . Ei . What ? You are not going to allow that the old prune ruin the rest of the day , will you ? She 's nuts , she 's a lunatic . It 's like an act . " They just do it ... " " I know . " I 'm sorry , she just tell the nurse . Well , why ? I don 't get it . Before you were born I was pregnant twice and they were both born death . Why you never told me this ? It 's not something I like to remember . And then when I was pregnant with you ... I was terrified . I had to expect the worse . Then ? And you gave up fine . And ever since then , I have considered you my little miracle baby . Don 't cry . Come on , let 's go . It 's late . I didn 't want to be in the movie anyway . I was cold so I want to wear my clothes . But Mr. Miller took my shirt off .. What the fuck are you doing ? Shh .. I need quiet for this . Are you stupid or what man ? Maybe there is a reason why you repressed some pervert who had you in his tidy-widy . I think twice about what you are doing . You could wake up a lot more fuck up than you are now . I 'm fuck up than I already am . You think you know me ? I don 't know me ! No , it 's my fault . Can you get through one damn day without breaking something ? Hey ! Evan ! Oh my God , it 's been a long time . How 've you been ? Same know , you know .. No , I don 't know . Fill me in . Well .. go on the state now .. all 's good .. my mom 's good . You want some ? No , now since I was kid . I quit like a hundred times . Are you walking home ? Can I walk you ? Sure . My God . So .. how 's Tommy ? Well they kept him in the Juville for a few years , but .. now he is working over at Dell 's Autobody . That 's cool . Still live in with your Dad ? No I pay for myself at fifteen . Must have taken alot of courage . Not if you remember my Dad . Can 't you just move in with your Mom ? No , she had a new family , wasn 't enough room . ... whatever . Look , the reason why I came back is to talk to you . To me ? Why ? Well , .. remember we were kids and I used to have those blackouts ? Ya , of course . Some of those memories - they 're coming back to me . .. and I just want to talk to you about just one particular . I try to remember . When we were kids , your Dad was making a movie .. about Robin Hood , or something ... What do you want to know Evan ? Did he ... what happened at the basement ? Look , it was a long time ago . I know . Is that why you came all the way back here ? To ask about lots of stupid questions about Robin Hood ? No . I just think that something really bad might happen . Was there a point in any of this ? Look , whatever that happened wasn 't your fault . We were kids , and there is nothing we can do to deserve what he has done . Shut up Evan ! You 're wasting your breath . You can 't hate yourself because your Dad is a twisted freak . Who are you trying to convince Evan ? You came all the way back here to stir my shit just .. because you have a bad memory ? What ? You want me to just .. cry on your shoulder and everything is all better now ? Well fuck you Evan ! Nothing is all better OK . Nothing ever gets better . You know ? If I were so wonderful Evan , .. why don 't you call me ? Why did you leave me here to rot ? Some dude left a message for you . You can smoke all you want at the bathroom . Hi Evan this is Professor Carter . Just wondered why you didn 't hand in your essay this afternoon I was concerned . Call me to schedule a makeup . What did you say to my sister you motherfucker ? Last night she cried on the phone for over an hour . She said you came and saw her last night . She ... She fucking kill herself Tonight . She 's dead . .. and so are you . If the scar on my stomach did 'nt come out of nowhere .. maybe my father wasn 't as crazy as everyone thought . If I can make scars , do I have the power to heal them ? What about Kelly 's scars ? I wan 't wanting to be in the movies anyway It was cold . So I wanted to wear my clothes . .. but Mr Miller .. took my shirt off . I got an idea . Lets go down to the basement . Looked more like a dungeon down there . A little light here . Hey , what did I tell you about keeping the door shut ? But I wanted to see . See the back of my fist in two seconds if you don 't do as I tell you . Now , and this part of the story Robin Hood had just married Maid Mariane . .. and they have to kiss and stuff like grownups do . So , take off you clothes Kelly . Come on , like we take a bath . Don 't make a big deal out of it . You too Evan . Come on lets go , lets go ! We 're making a movie here . Puts your hands on your ears Kelly . What time is it ? It 's time for you to do what I tell you to do . Wrong answer fuckbag ! This is the very moment of your reckoning . In the next thirty seconds you 're gonna open up one of two doors . The first door , you forever traumatise your own fresh and blood . What 's happending ? How are you doing this ? It will change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell . Her only trust was being betrayed by her own sick pedophil father . Ultimately it will lead to her suicide . Nice work Daddy . Who are you ? Lets say you are being closely watched George . The other option is to treat Kelly like ... .. say a loving father treats her daughter . Sound it OK , you Papa ? Yes . Listen close you fuckbag . You screw this up again , I swear I 'll castrate you . What you need to do , is to discipline your son Tommy cause the kid is one sadistic pop . A last thing . Don 't ever touch me again . No , I won 't . Faster , faster .. Croquette ! I will return to look for you Kelly I can 't believe you came ! .. you got that one .. Check out our new house .. Honey , are you alright ?

Don 't you remember that ? Evan , it 's not his fault . You know how bad he had it when we were kids . Oh no , don 't give me this bad up-bringing shit . You turned out just fine .

Hey doc ! What 's the damage ? How much time do I got ? Cute Evan . This is a little complicated . I haven 't seen results like this before . Not even with my father ? Well actually they had these tests twenty years ago . So what did you find ? We 're finding most of the hemorrhage is coming from here .. where most of the outer layer - cerebral cortex . That is where the memory is stored , Mom . Thank you , Evan . I 've never seen anything like it . We compared these with the one taken last year .. we found severe hemorrhage .. and massive reconstruction . And what does that mean for Evan ? What he said Mom is I jammed forty years of memories in my head .. in the last year . So overload my circuit and I completely reprogram my brain . That 's about it , right ? Ya . I going to wait in the car . The lighting here kind of bug my eyes . It 's good seeing you doc . I found this ... really ... really informative . But you know .. .. people I 'm seeing .. things to read . Bye , see you . It 's me . Evan . Can I get you anything ? What about ... What about some of those models airplanes you like huh ? I can ship some of those model airplanes up in the air ? Lenny . You knew the whole time , didn 't you ? When you put that sharp in my hand . You knew something big is going to happen . Did you ? Ya . I knew it . And you should be where I am . You should be .. .. where I am . Today I got to meet my father . His name is Jason . And he 's crazy . I wish he can let me call him Dad . You OK ? because you look .. .. like you went somewhere else for a second . Look Jason ! I need some fast information if I am going to fix what I have done . I was praying this craz would end with me . Ya , but you didn 't it . So now I need some information to make things right again . You 're the only one that can give it to me . There is no right ! You can 't change what pepole are without destorying who they were . Who says you can 't make things better ? You can 't play God son . It must end with me . Just by being you , you might be killing you and your mother . That is bullshit you know ! I 'll send you a postcard when I made everything perfect again . I will ... Just get out , did you ? No nothing , it 's just that my brother did a sting in the penitent . He used to eat like that . You come from a big family . Well , I meant no offence . Note taken . Hey ... Did Kelly Miller still work here ? Sorry , I have never heard of her . Can you make it a God damn peace in his own house ? Don 't suppose you 're here to sell cookies ? Good guess fuckbag . You remember me ? We had a nice chat once when I was seven . I got one question for you . Where can I find your daughter ? Oh , I thought you were someone else . Make it fast , I 'm expecting someone . Can I come in ? If I knew you were coming , I would have cleaned this place shit . What do you want ? I just want to see a friend , a face . Well , .. time is money Evan . Money . Guess I can spare a ten minutes for a old friend , right ? So ? How 's tricks ? Sorry ! Occupational humour . I got it . You stop . Oh sorry . Is my line of work making you uncomfortable , precious ? No . Just that .. I feel like you have to use that to hurt me . I 've been where you 've been . Ha .. where is that ? You wouldn 't believe me if I told you . That all people always say that you wouldn 't believe me but .. in this case , it 's not any more tried . I didn 't know where to find you . So I forced your Dad to tell me where you are . So I came here , you know You are right Evan , I won 't believe you . I never though you would . That 's why I never bother to tell a soul until now and I 'll never will again . I 'm the only person you 've told ? That 's a great lie . Does that make other girls wet ? Do they actually eat up that bullshit ? You know , I don 't give a shit .. whether you believe me or not . Frankly , I 'm too tried to prove it to you . Oh there 's proofs now huh ? How else would I know that you got a mole on you inner tigh ? Anyone with fifty bucks can tell you that . Ok . Forget that . How about the fact that you prefer the smell of skunk to flowers .. or you hate Sonatro .. because for some reasons unknown to you it reminded you of your step-sister . .. or that you have an orgasm , your toes go numb . I 'm sure all your clients told you perfectly that . You know .. I just thought you should know . Know what ? That you were happy once . .. with me . You know , there is one major hole in your story . There is no fucking way in this planet , or any other .. I would ever be in this fucking sorority . You were happy then . Oh you are crying . You sure you don 't need your wait ? No , I don 't need it where I 'm going . Why you 're off to change everyone 's life again . Is that it ? Maybe next time you 'll pop up in some mansion .. while I end up in Tijuana doing some donkey act . You know , I 'm over it . Everytime I tried to help someone , .. everythings just goes to shit . Don 't give up now , slick . Hell , you 've already done so much for me . Why don 't you go back in time and save Mrs Harben and her baby ? And then maybe , Lenny wouldn 't freak out and ruin my family . No , go back to when I 'm seven .. and fuck me for my Daddy 's video camera . Straighten me out abit . You 're on my bed , get out ! Buddy , I thought you 're OK when you 're being sick and all . I 'm not going to say it again . The last thing I remembered before the blackout was holding my hands over Kelly 's ears . I think I was more focused on her hands on mine than the mailbox across the street . Lady stay back . Don 't go near the mailbox . Idiot ! I mean it , get the hell back ! I 'll save you lady ! God damned it . I thought I call you two to get out . Sorry man , did we wake you ? No , it 's cool . It 's really cool . What the fuck is this ? .. save his arms ! .. goes to the movies , can I come too ? What 's happening Evan ? Kelly get some help ! Evan ! Oh my God . Evan ! Evan ! .. did you ever looked at Kelly 's smile . I love your smile . Lenny is the best . You 're going to make a great couple . You believe that I will find someone ? Evan ! Where are we going ? We taking you to the hospital Evan . No , take me back ! Sorry , your mother would kill me . You take me back , Lenny ! You owe me that much . What are you geeks looking at ? Must be nice to be so God damned perfect . Fucking losers . Lenny help me . Get him over . Hey hey Brian ! How 's your head feeling buddy ? I saw the girl you went home with . She borrowed your razor this morning ? So bad ! Hey , it 's Tommy . Hey Tommy ! Tommy ! What 's up guys ? Hey man . I did what you said . We 're pulling the student funds from the Halo House and having an awareness dance . Oh awesome . Maybe I can spin my chair around to the techno remix of Halva Negila till I puke . Maybe we should be getting to class now . What 's the point of psy class now ? Tomorrow I can wake up in a dirt farm in Bangladesh . Lets go for a stroll . Bye . Bye sis . Good day ! What 's wrong with him today ? So Tommy is really into this Jesus freak thing . You know how spiritually he has gone ever since he saved Mrs Harben and her kiddy . He saved Ms Harben ? Please , what 's this fuck ? Let sit right here . You want a bar ? Here . Ya .. I got to fix this things . Kelly . Did you ever think about us ? Did you ever .. .. wonders if things might be different .. between us ? Sure Evan . You 're the first person I ever care about . I was ? Ya . That 's why when I was little , I never went to live with my mother . I don 't get it . When my folks split up , they gave me and Tommy a choice of where we want to live with . And I couldn 't stand my Dad . But I knew that if I went to live with my Mom , I never see you again . I didn 't know that . So ? You still think about us ? Together ? Well .. it crossed my mind from time to time . And ? Well , a lot of things have crossed my mind Evan . I mean , I can play out the entire movie of our lives in one second . Boom ! we fall in love , we get married , we get kids .. our kids grow old as do we . matching burials , the whole thing . Blah ! Takes a lot to spit out to imagine . Things like that usually do . So .. do you think that it might have worth ? Ya . But that 's now how things wind up . I 'm with Lenny . Lenny is your friend . There 's where it ends . Would it make a differences if I told you that .. no one can possibly ever love you as much as I love you ? You know what I 'm saying ? I 'm not saying like .. if you were a girl , would that be something that you would want to hear . Hold on one second I 'll be right back , OK ? Forgot to put the toes on the latch . Lenny likes You guys are holding better now . I know it 's hard but you can 't give up . I can 't even fucking kill myself . Don 't talk like that . Alright . I got to get you out , visiting hours is almost over . What are you talking about ? She 's been here the entire time . Looking good kiddo . Lung cancer . You started chain smoke when I blow myself up . Sorry , he 's been acting out of sort lately . I think I can fix this . Fix ? I only need the lines about the blow up . Shit , no arms . I never wrote it . You 're ... actting ... different . That 's only difficult moments . Mom . You 're going to be OK . I can change it . Maybe I like to go down to the chapel . You 're acting just like your father . Just because he went crazy when he was my age does 'nt mean I 'm gonna be crazy . How ... did ... you ... know about this ? You told me ... Parents weekend , remember ? It wasn 't me ... Just ... - Who are you ? ... like ... Jason . Don 't worry , mum I 'm going to get you out of here . OK ? No . You 're not going to hurt anymore . I 'm going to fix it . No . Are you sure you even pack it ? My mother has it . I have to send it home . This is it ? Ya . What do you want it for ? I don 't get you lately . Let you know later . Ok , have to ask you one last favour . What ? I need you to be quiet . Have to concentrate if I want to search the blockbuster . The blockbuster ? If I hadn 't blown off my arms , my mom would never started smoking in the first place . Never mind , just open it . Turn it . There . Today Mommy is taking me to play with Kelly and Tommy . I would meet their father and see what a real Dad is like . Now , how do I destory the blockbuster ? Evan , what are you doing with the knife ? That didn 't work . Turn it . Turn . There . I didn 't want to be in the movie anyway . I feel cold and want to wear my clothes ... In this part of the story , Robin Hood .. has just married the Maid Marianne . .. and they have to kiss and stuff , like grownups do . Wait , I need my belt . Don 't even bother about the belt . Back off fuckbag ! Amazing what would never make an impression of you . Easy does it Evan . Don 't be a bad boy , or I will tell your mother what a naughty little shit you are . And I will tell the child protectors service about your little kiddy porn in there . One step further and I 'll shalf this up your ass . It 's dangerous , you can blow off your hand . Been there , done that . Cracker . Kelly ! No ! Hey man . .. look great .. .. this boy must be cared for in a psychiatric hospital What did you see ? A crushed butterfly . I 'm so sick of this ! .. finished your program ? .. taken your medicine ? Where are my Goddamned books ? Evan ? We 're suppose to meet for another hour . Where are my Goddamned books ? Books ? My journals . I need them . So .. give them to me . It 'll help alot . Really hurts me to go through this again . There are not journals . There never were . It 's part of the fantasy world that your mind created to cope with the guilt .. of killing Kelly Miller . Think Evan , think . You created desease that does not exist . Alternating universe with colleges and prison and .. I want my journals , and I want them now ! I know that you got them you got to give them to me . You are not going to lie to me I want them ! You reminded me of your father . He was always screaming for photo album , even though he doesn 't have one . I 'm so sorry . I am not ... Photo album ? Photos . The damage is irreparable . Frankly I 'm surprised that he still have use of his motor functions . Mom . Did you remember to bring those old movies that we used to make ? Ya . They right here . Good , because I really like to watch them . So that 's good . I believe it is best that we transfer him to Bellevue first thing in the morning . Anyone finds this .. .. it means that my plan didn 't work . .. and I 'm already dead . He 's not in his room . Search the grounds ! .. if I can somehow go back .. to the beginning of all of these . .. I might be able to save her . Evan ! Over here ! Evan ! I believe he is inside . Evan ! Jason , cut it up . I 'm trying to have a baby . Evan ! Open up ! Go away Something is wrong ! It kill me ! Make it stop ! Her heart rhythm is accelerating . What 's happening ? You have no life line , you have no soul . You were never meant to be . He is chocking himself ! No ! It is necessary to intubar it , fast . to practice a Caesarean . Save him ! She 's not receiving enough oxygen ! - We 're losing him ! We 're losing him ! - No ! Before you were born I was pregnant 3 times but they were all born death . Since then I saw you like my miracle being ... Not aigain ! No ! I could 'nt stand my dad but I knew if I went away with my mum I never see you again . Kelly , Tommy ! I missed you ! I never let us be separated again ! Happiness can only be achieved through sacrifice . Like the sacrifice our parents have made for us to bring us here today .

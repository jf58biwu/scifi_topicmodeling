 Sally , could you pass us some of that corn ? Sure . Thank you . Dick , wouldn 't you prefer it if we sat together ? Oh , of course I would , Mary , but you didn 't call shotgun quickly enough . Well , nobody told me I had to . Crybaby . Look , I 'm not going to go over the rules again , Albright . Better luck next time , Ok ? It 's a beautiful night , isn 't it ? Oh . Yeah . Actually , it 's a little warm for my tastes . Well , that 's an interesting look , Harry . Well , it was the last clean piece of laundry in the house . Our washer and dryer broke . We 're waiting for Dubcek 's nephew to get out of rehab so he can fix it . Remember that odd smell in the office today , Mary ? I said it was Nina 's leftover paella . Well , it wasn 't . Oh , come on . Look , I hate the laundromat as much as anybody , but just go and wash your clothes . Laundry-mat ? So you 're saying we can just prance into this laundry-mat with our dirty clothes ? And use their washers and dryers ? [ Sarcastically ] Yeah , right . That 'll work . Dick , please can I sit in front ? Forget about it , Chickie . My poor Mary . You miss me . I 'll tell you what . Sally , you move up here . I want to go sit next to my wee bonnie lass . Now this is more like it . Yeah . That 's the stuff . Dick , your family . No , no , no . They don 't mind . Yeah , we won 't look . Make your move ! Oh , go ahead . No , no , no ... morning , Mary ! Ahh , I had a great time last night , didn 't you ? No . Dick , I cannot do that again . Oh , you 're right . Next time , maybe we should all just stay home and have game night . No . No offense , but I cannot spend another evening playing chutes and ladders with Sally , Tommy , and Harry . What about kerplunk ? No , Dick . We need to socialize with other people . Ri--what about hungry , hungry hippos ? Dick . I 'm serious . We need to broaden our social horizons . Go out with another couple . Another couple ? Why would we want to go out with another couple ? It 'll be fun . I don 't know , Mary . How do you know ? It could be really weird . Us ? Alone with 2 people ? A whole dinner ? What if nobody even talked ? I don 't think it 's worth the risk . Do it for me . Ok . Now we just have to think of a couple that would be fun to go out with . Judith is always talking about her boyfriend Trent . Dick , I 'm not sure ... but I think Trent may be imaginary . Yeah . Nina , you have a boyfriend now , don 't you ? I sure do . Well , how about the 2 of you and the 2-- - no . There 's a woman in my tennis clinic- - Gwen McMICHAEL , very sweet . I 'll call her and see if she and her husband would like to join us for dinner . Uh , all right . But just to be safe , I 'd better bring along candyland . Oh , my god . Look at this place . Those interlocking chairs go on for miles . It 's so bright . Like heaven . Look at all the machines . We could do more than one load at once . Yes ! Now all my cute little tops will never again cross paths with your skidmarked jockeys . This is the future . Oh , it 's broadband , baby . Hello . Why aren 't they here ? I bet they 're not coming . Oh , just relax . They 're 2 minutes late . Well , then , they 're just plain rude . We should leave . Dick , sit . Oh , here they are . Gwen . Mary . Hi ! Hi ! You look so nice . Oh , I love your jacket . Oh , Ralph Lauren . You must be Larry . I must be . I hope we haven 't kept you waiting too long . Oh , no , not at all . I love watching people . It 's what I do . After all I do have a Ph.D. In anthropology . Oh ! This is Dick . Dick ? My name is Dick Solomon . I 'm from Ohio . I like to read books . My favorite color is red . I--I teach physics , and my dream is to someday learn to ride a bicycle . That 's an icebreaker if I 've ever heard one . Why don 't you sit down ? I 'm Larry McMICHAEL . I 'm in printing . I like fly-fishing , and my dream ... is to find a wife who won 't spend so darn much money . Oh , you ! Waiter ! Could I get a bottle of your best red wine ? On me . Oh , why , thank you , Larry . You know , Mary , if it were up to my husband , we 'd probably never socialize at all . I mean , we 'd probably never even leave the house . Why should I leave the house ? I 've got cable . He 's got cable . The only television I watch is the history channel . Anyway , why don 't we order ? These guys are probably starving . Dick 's eaten 3 bowls of nuts . Oh , you . It 's true . It is not . Come on , guys . We don 't have a full load yet . Is this washable ? Sure . Well , everybody , I 'm off . How was last night ? Oh , Mary and I had the most wonderful time with Larry and Gwen McMICHAEL . We spent over an hour talking about movies . Then Mary and Gwen got into a huddle and talked about gardening while Larry and I talked about traffic . It turns out he hates it as much as I do . That sounds great . You know , you guys want to have a really good time ? You should all come to the Rutherford rinse with us . Yes , about that . Sally , Tommy , Harry , please sit down . There 's something I have to tell you and ... it 's not going to be easy . I know how much you all enjoy the times that you 've spent with Mary and me , Dick , is that vest a little stinky ? Maybe a little . Ok , give it . But Mary and I have come to a decision . You know I think those pants might be a little crusty , too . Yeah . Stand up . We want to spend all of our free time with Gwen and Larry . Mary says , and I have to agree with her , that it 's rare for 2 couples to mesh together so perfectly . And so I 'm afraid that means that we won 't be spending any more time with the 3 of you . Aw , that 's a shame . Hey , got any quarters ? Yeah . There 's a couple in the left-hand pocket . Ok . Great . See you later . Bye-Bye . Need any help ? Thanks . No . Thank you . [ Dryer buzzes ] Aah ! That 's us . Ok . Grab that basket . Hey , hey , what are you doing ? That 's my basket . But you 're not using it . I will when my clothes are done . No , see , ours are done now . Congratulations . What 's her problem ? I don 't know . Whatever . Look , let 's just use that dryer . These clothes have been done forever . Hey ! What do you think you 're doing ? You 're touching my stuff . It was done . Yeah , you weren 't here . You don 't touch other people 's stuff . I knew this place was too good to be true . It 's Ok . Just stay calm now . Everything 's fine . We 're just going to go over here and do another load of laundry . Ok . Hey , that 's my machine ! What 're you talking about ? It 's empty . No , I put my magazine on it to hold it . What 's that supposed to do ? This is chaos . Look , you cannot reserve anything with a magazine . That 's right . I 'm sorry , man . Those are the rules . Whose rules ? My rules . Can I at least get my magazine back ? No . Yeah , you keep walking , jerky . Run ! Match point ! Would you serve , already ? Got it ! Got it ! Got it ! Got it ! Got it ! Got it ! Got it ! Got it ! Switch ! Game . Set . Match . Eat dirt , you McMICHAELS . Aah ! I should have warned you I played tennis in college . Great game , partner ! So , who 's up for a beer , huh ? Oh , that sounds great . I don 't think we can . We 've got a carpet guy coming . Oh , well , what about after ? Ah , well , you know they have to measure , and that just takes forever . You know , we should really get going , Gwen . Yeah . Hey . You want to go see that new Norwegian film ? I did a post-thesis dig on a fjord near where it was shot . True story . So , should I get some tickets ? Oh , gosh . I think we 've got something on our calendar . Anyway ... we 'll give you a buzz . Take care , now . Maybe we can get together next weekend . Buzz buzz . We 'll give you a buzz . Mary , have they called back yet ? Gwen and Larry ? No . I 've left several messages , though . Oh , why haven 't they returned our calls ? This is madness . Mary , let 's try them again . Oh , Dick , no . I don 't want to appear too desperate . But we are ! Maybe they don 't like you as much as you thought . Maybe they 're dead . Do you think they 're brushing us off ? Well , why would they do that ? Dr. Solomon , when you 're around them , are you just being yourself ? Well , of course I am . Hmm . There you go . Larry ! Oh , there you are . Thank god . You 're alive . Dick . Gwen ! Oh ! Oh ! Dick , what are you doing here ? Why haven 't you returned our calls ? Please tell me it 's because you don 't know how to use your answering machine . Well , Gwen . We 've been sort of busy . Busy ? Busy playing tennis without us ? Why ? Was it something I did ? No . No . It wasn 't you at all . We like you , Dick . Oh , thank god . You like me . So there 's no problem . Unless , of course , you don 't like Mary . Oh , my god . You don 't like Mary . It 's not that we don 't like her , Dick . It 's just that ... well , she 's kind of ... oh , I don 't know ... tedious . Yeah . Pretentious ? And completely self-Absorbed . Mary ? We 're sorry , Dick , but her credit card says " Mary Albright , Ph.D. " Now that 's just yucky . But you 've got her all wrong . Mary is a wonderful person . You hardly even know her . Dick . You 've got to give her another chance . Please . For me . Well , maybe we were a little quick to judge . Larry ? Wouldn 't be the first time . We said we 'd never use that outdoor chicken rotisserie , and what did we have for dinner last night ? Rotisserie chicken . Guilty ! So , that means you 'll give her another chance ? Ok . Sure . Oh , great . All right . What have we got , Tommy ? The lady says she stepped out of the laundromat to get a coffee . When she returned , her slipcovers had been removed from the dryer and placed on the folding table . She also claims they were still wet . Is this a fact , sir ? He moved my stuff . I am not talking to you . I 'm saying , I went- - zip it ! Tommy ... [ Clears throat ] Why don 't you tell our friend here the rules . The rules are : you are not to remove someone else 's moist items from the dryer . Now , was it moist ? It was damp . Don 't pee on my shoes and tell me the washer 's leaking . Now , was it moist ? It was moist , ma 'am . Crowd : ahh ! What is the matter with these people ? Beats me , ma 'am . You , buster , you better grow up . You owe this woman 20 minutes of drying time . I told you . And you , young lady , you better drop that attitude . Here 's a little piece of advice- - you 've heard this before- - Colors fade ... but dumb is forever . Next ! So even though I had 4 universities vying for me , I chose Pendleton because , I don 't know , there was something quaint about it . Oh , quaint . Yeah . Really ? You don 't mean quaint . You mean humble , don 't you , Mary ? She means humble . Mary loves humble things . Oh , there was a certain je Ne sais- - breadsticks . Who wants a tasty breadstick ? I 'm so glad Dick finally got in touch with you . I was beginning to think you didn 't like us . How silly . Don 't be so needy , Mary . [ Clears throat ] So , uh , let 's order . Gwen , do you want to split a Caesar ? I 'll let you have all the anchovies . You got a deal . Great . Here is an interesting little anthropological tidbit from this photographic mind of mine . Did you know that the anchovy was the staple food of the Phoenicians ? I didn 't know that . And they 're so little . Why don 't we get a bottle of wine for the table . Yes , a nice buttery chardonnay . Not too oaky . No , we wouldn 't want it to be too oaky . Mary , maybe you don 't need anything to drink tonight . What ? ! Well , darling , you know how sleepy and long-winded wine makes you . No , actually , let 's get a bottle of wine . I feel like we 're going to need it . Good times . Get out of here . Sally ? Got some bad news . Oh , my god . Tommy , what is it ? It 's about the washer and dryer at home . I 'm afraid that they 've been fixed . No ! Sally , it 's Ok . But--but these people need me . Sally , you 've got to be strong . For them . It 's Ok . It 's all right . I know . I know . Hey , I was hoping you 'd come back . I came back to say good-Bye . Well , can 't we go across the street to the diner and get a cup of coffee or something ? June bug ... what we had here was very special . Hum of the dryers , fluorescent lights , sweet , sweet smell of softener sheets . But take that away , and I 'm afraid we got nothing . What are you , some kind of moron ? I know it 's hard to understand , but , uh , at least we 'll always have this , huh ? And this . Hey ! Oh , that 's gross . That 's right . That 's right . Fight daddy . Fight daddy . So , anyway , after graduate school , I took this trip through wine country , and the funniest thing happened . Is this the one where she meets the guy who looks just like tony Curtis ? No , this is the stunner where she forgot that the dog was blind . Oh , have I told this already ? Yes , Mary . You 've told it already . Thank you , Dick . Tell it again . Oh , Dick , I--I- - tell it ... again ! I don 't think Gwen and Larry want to hear it- - I don 't give a flying fudgsicle what Gwen and Larry want . Both : what ? ! Look at you two sitting there all fake smiles and fake friendly . Looking all fake with your fakeness and your fake little world . How dare you ? ! Get out ! Come on , Gwen . I have never noticed it before , but you look capable of violence . I 'll show you who 's capable of violence . Dick ! Dick ! Dick ! Dick ! Dick ! Dick ! What the hell just happened here ? Mary , there 's something I haven 't told you about those two . What ? They don 't- - they don 't- - I don 't like them . Why ? They 're tedious and pretentious and completely self-Absorbed . Mary , our time together is too precious to waste with people like that . They were getting a little dull . I found myself doing all the talking . I could listen to you all day . So , anyway , the trip through wine country . I was with my friend Charlotte . And we- - didn 't you forget the part about the train ride ? Yeah--have I told this already ? No . So , anyway , Charlotte 's French Both : wasn 't very good . And I , of course , had just come back from the Sorbonne , so we 're sitting at this table , and a man approaches the table wearing the most humongous collar ... now isn 't this better , Mary ? I suppose . We don 't need to be out with another couple , now do we ? No . Ok , Albright . In the back . This is ridiculous , the next time I 'm sitting in the front . I call shotgun for next time . I call shotgun for time after that . Shotgun infinity . Can she call shotgun infinity ? I 'm afraid so . Yes !

 Bring in the prisoner . Creegan must die . Creegan must die . Creegan must die . Creegan must die . Creegan must die . In uniting the underlords and reestablishing law and order , I vowed that all remnants of the lawlessness that preceded would be utterly wiped out . Its memory alone would be enough of a reminder and a deterrent . So after reviewing the charges before me , charges of crimes against humanity and mutantity for blatant complicity with the Bailies , I have no choice but to condemn the defendant to death . That 's right . Bring it on . May your evil die with you as well . I 'm glad to see Marla stand true to her word . A little law and order might be ... just what we need down here . Cleo , cheer up . This is a good thing . Since when is an execution a good thing ? Don 't waste your compassion on Creegan , Cleo . Believe me , he wouldn 't return the sentiment . See , back in my time , when people didn 't believe in things ... they went out with signs and protested them . Now you just blast ' em . Listen , despite the dozens of people that wanted to , nobody blasted Creegan . That 's right . He was tried and found guilty . So , what , you didn 't believe in punishing criminals in your day ? No , I don 't believe in capital punishment , executing criminals . So , if a criminal is found guilty as charged ... Right . Exactly . If they get the right criminal and not some innocent guy ... which has been known to happen , you know . And that 's not even talking about the barbaric side of strapping somebody to an electric chair and then frying them . It 's gross . Sarge , there 's a situation in the maximum detention block . Voice , do you think maybe you can give me a signal when you 're gonna shout in my ear ? Get used to it . No , I don 't wanna get used to it . Voice , when are you and Hel gonna kiss and make up so you can get back in her head where you belong ? When I feel Hel is ready . In the meantime , Sarge , you 're acting team leader and there is a situation in the detention block . It 's Creegan . Creegan ? Creegan ? Come on , this way . Surround the perimeter . Come on , move it . We put him back in his cell . He said he wasn 't feeling well . The oldest trick in the book . We had to drop the force field to run a bio-scan . He got a hold of the med tech before we could throw a force field at him . Creegan insisted on talking to Hel . Voice says Creegan 's only gonna talk to you , Hel . Hello , Hel . Okay , Creegan . Let 's get this over with . You have an appointment to keep . Oh , yes , my execution . I must admit , I thought the sentence a little extreme . Can you imagine me dead ? Yes , many times . What do you want ? It 's what you want , Helen . Would you really have me let loose of this mortal coil without me revealing all my secrets ? Don 't listen to him , Hel . It 's just another one of his sick mind screws . That 's right , Helen . It 's just a mind game . What can I possibly know about Voice ? Nothing . I don 't wanna play anymore . I 'm tired of the way you weave your sick little lies with bits of truth . I 'm not interested . Take what you know to the grave . As you wish . Personally , I 'd want to know why Voice has chosen me , to fight her private little war with the Bailies . Let him go first . Thanks for playing . Wait . Hel . I 'm listening . From the day you woke up with that Voice in your head , you 've wondered haven 't you , Helen ? Who is she , really ? And why does she show such a particular interest in you ? Sarge , stop this now . Hel , get back . What do you know ? Everything . Oh ! That 's my body . You 're a dead man , Creegan . No ! Wait . Sarge . Hel , are you okay ? I 'm fine , Cleopatra . No harm done . What did he say to you ? I 'm not who you think I am . Forget it . He 's mad . Five hundred years into the future , she will enter a world where machines rule the Earth . Mankind has been driven underground . And Cleopatra is about to discover there 's no place like home .

Oh , I need a drink . Hey , cup of mash . Cup of mash . A glass of 103-Level mash to settle my nerves . I think I 'd need something to settle my stomach if Creegan kissed me like that . It 'd almost be worth a shot of the hard stuff just to wash the taste out of your mouth . You 're uncharacteristically quiet on the subject , Voice . How do you feel about your old friend Creegan taking his last foul breath ? Hmm ? You hear the question , Voice ? Tell Hel I 'm pleased justice is being served . Voice says justice is served , the usual . You know , that must be tough , having had the Voice in your head for so long and then all of a sudden she 's gone . Gone ? Oh , yes , it is . You don 't understand . Creegan has escaped in my body . I mean , Hel 's body . I need to talk to my team . I wouldn 't believe me , either . Nice ploy , Creegan . The old " body switch . " I 've got to try that one . Hey , hey , somebody stole my body ! You 've got the wrong guy . I swear ! It 's me , Creegan , Tox . Tox ? We go way back . The B-factories , the tunnel wars , the first-ever multilevel peace talks . The ones that crashed and burned . You were behind that blood bath ? You and Creegan ? You and me ? Those were the days . It 's gonna be hard to imagine the underground after they demolecularize your ass . Thanks . Yeah . Without you around to shake things up , Hel and her like are gonna have the run of the place . Tox , I 'm getting out . Do you understand , you sorry excuse for a human life form ? And you 're gonna help me . You really going down there to protest Creegan 's execution ? Yup . I 'm sorry , Hel . I know that Creegan killed your dad , but I have to stand by my convictions . Knock yourself out , Cleopatra . Cleo , wait up . Are you going to help me with the protest ? I can make up another sign in a jiff . Nope , I just wanna get a good seat for when they scatter that sick bastard 's molecules . That 's great . That 's the spirit , yeah . Hey , Hel ? You comin ' ? No . No , uh , in a weird way , Creegan 's been such a big part of my life , I don 't think I could stand to see him vaporized . You two have fun . Okay . Okay . Guards ! You gotta stop him . Creegan 's gonna off himself ! What 's going on here ? Keep it down , you losers . Step away from the force field . I said , step back . He 's gonna do it , man . Wow . He 's gonna kill himself . That 's the plan , baby . Not on my watch . Shut down the force field . Fry , Creegan , fry . Do it now ! Get up , Creegan . I said , get up ! Yeah , mate ! Freeze , Creegan . Sorry . Nice , Creegan . I think I pulled something . The , uh , deactivator is on his belt there for my door . Sure . Right , I 'll stay here . Creegan , Creegan ... Creegan , yeah ! Go , Creegan . Shut up ! Hold your fire . Get him ! This way , come on ! I knew you wouldn 't leave me , buddy . Come on , now . Do it . Encrypted , encrypted , encrypted . Is there anything in this blasted lab that I can use ? Hel , is there a problem ? I don 't know , Mauser . I seem to be having trouble with the command override system . Everything seems to be functioning properly . What systems were you trying to override ? You 'll do for starters . Ooh . Clemency for Creegan . Okay , so he 's evil , you know , but he 's still human . Clemency for Creegan . You can 't demolecularize your conscience . Clemency for Creegan . What is this ? Texas ? Cleo , it 's me , Hel . Hmm ? You have to listen to me . Creegan pulled some kind of switch when I was in his cell . He 's me now . I know it sounds crazy . You have to help me to get to Marla 's chambers . I have to convince her to delay the execution . Mmm . Now , I 'm going to take my hand away . Just take it easy . Help ! It 's Creegan . He 's escaped . Somebody just shoot him ! Creegan ? So much for not believing in capital punishment . Anybody - Cleo , you have to help me . Security breach . Get away from me , you freak . Security breach . They 're coming for you , Creegan . Lockdown sequence activated . Don 't call me Creegan . Freeze , Creegan . Hold it . You 've got nowhere to run . No . Let Cleo go . Sarge ! Sarge , listen to me . Nothing you could say interests me . Sarge , do you have a clear shot ? Cleo is not clear , Voice . Sarge , do what you have to do . Sarge . Let Cleo go , or I will kill you . Get them ! Cleo ! Damn it . I believe there is a piece of equipment in this lab to lead me to Voice . That would be you , Mauser . Where did we put that Voice beacon of yours ? Hmm ? Ah , yes , behind your left ear . Hel , are you in the lab ? Voice , it 's been a long time . Hel , the lab sensors are offline and I can 't contact Mauser . Technical glitch , Voice . In fact , I 'm performing a diagnostic on him now . I feared the worst . Hel , Creegan has escaped from his cell . I won 't make a very good hostage you know . We all have orders to die rather than negotiate with creeps like you . Hel and Sarge won 't hesitate to sacrifice my life ... to take you down , mister . Sarge hesitated back there . I would have , too . Cleo , what I told you before was true . You 're Hel . Yes . Are you trying to establish some kind of insanity defense or something ? Hel , Creegan 's escaped . He 's taken Cleo hostage . I heard . We must recapture Creegan before he does any more damage . Sarge , is everything all right there ? I still can 't contact Mauser . Hel , where 's Mauser ? We were having some problems with our lab systems . So , uh , Mauser 's all over it . Sarge , I registered a massive power overload in Mauser 's systems before I lost contact , as if he 'd been badly damaged . Voice is worried . She got some weird power readings off - I told you , Mauser 's fine . Are you going to waste time interrogating me or are we going to find Creegan ? I 'm sorry , Sarge . It 's just that the thought of what that fiend might be doing to Cleopatra , just drives me crazy . Yeah . Me , too . But , we still may be able to track her down through her gauntlets . If she 's still wearing them . Get your hands off of me . Give me those gauntlets . I can prove to Sarge and Voice that I 'm the real Hel . Hands off my gauntlets . Damn it , Cleo , let go ! I win . You just keep your distance , freak , or I 'll zap that clown makeup right off of your face . Fine . Fine , we 'll just wait here . Huh ? You know , I bet Sarge and Voice have already activated that tracer in your gauntlet . I just hope Sarge gets here before Marla 's guards do . Why do you want Sarge so bad , huh , Creegan ? I 'm not Creegan . Right . I don 't know what game you 're playing at but I 'm not buying into it . What are you doing ? I 'm not letting you lure my friends into a trap . No , no ! You are so lucky I 'm not the real Creegan . Got her . Cleo 's in Shaft 87 , Level 209 . Wait a minute . 212 , 216 , 220 . She 's not stopping . You don 't think Creegan whacked her and threw her down the shaft , do you ? No , no , I really don 't think he did . Our motion sensors indicate activity this way . Look alive . Yes , sir . I wish Sarge could see how difficult you 're making things for me , she 'd be really impressed . Creegan . You 're a great man . Why don 't I leave you two alone ? Ha , ha . I want some distance between myself and Marla 's goons , so if you don 't mind . No problem , boss man . We 'll hide you . I think it would be better if we , uh , split up . Remember the old hidey-hole from the Tunnel Gang days ? Sure . It 's still there . Marla will never find us . Come on . Bring your friend . Creegan . All right . Let 's go . Sarge , Marla 's people have recaptured 11 prisoners . Let me guess , none of them are Creegan or Cleo ? I 'm afraid not . Still no sign . Run the surveillance hologram of the escape again . I knew Creegan was obsessed with you , Hel , but now he 's trying to copy your moves . He is not flexible . He 's got no ass . Jump forward . Freeze it . See something ' ? Are your gauntlets charged ? Always . Follow me . It 's just Tox . Hey , Creegan . Oh ! There 's a new smell . You should feel right at home . This is a great day ! Marla and her kind have tried to impose their law on the underground , on us ! Who does she think she is ? Yeah ! We make our own laws down here . Yeah . We answer to ourselves ! Yeah ! And to Creegan ! Yeah , Creegan . Nice going . You tell them , Creegan . You 're the man . Thanks . Yeah , thanks a lot , um , well , it 's so nice to see some old-old familiar faces , uh , once again . Drek , Scuzz . I didn 't think I 'd ever be this close to any of you , uh , ever , and I mean that . I really appreciate you inviting me down here to this wonderful hideout . So , thanks . So what are you all staring at , you bunch of brain-dead shaft oozes ? I just escaped from Marla 's cell ! Let 's do some crimes ! Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah , whoo . Good to see you again , Creegan . Yeah , welcome back . Leaving so soon ? I was just going to the powder room . Grabbing a hostage was a smart move , Creegan , Yeah . but we 're in the clear now and she 's just a liability . I want some of that . Back off , Tox . I grabbed this one . She belongs to me . Sorry , Creegan . You 're right . You kill her . Kill her . Come on . Well , go on then . Kill her . Kill her . Are you giving me orders ? No . You listen to me , you pus-ridden , crusty-faced , sewer leech , I make the rules . Next time you tell me what to do , I 'll be wearing your skin as a suit . You got that ? Oh . This little cupcake is mine . Oh , I 'll kill her in my own good time . In the meantime , we 're going to have some fun . Yeah . I 'd rather you just kill me . Creegan . Go , Creegan ! You 're the man . Whatever you 're going to do , just get it over with . But no kissing . Don 't worry , Cleo . You 're not my type . What ? I told you , I 'm not ... Ah , forget it . Let 's get out of here . Sarge . Why can 't you just die with dignity ? Hel ! No ! We let the law deal with him . Of course . Sarge ! Hel isn 't Hel ! Watch her - Come on , scumbag . Let 's go . You don 't have to watch this , Hel . Creegan is the most fiendishly brilliant mind alive . I won 't rest until I can see him dead with my own eyes . That 's far enough . Just look at him . Sarge , something 's hinky here . Yeah , you don 't like executions , I get it . No , Hel 's been acting weird ever since she went into Creegan 's cell . Defending him . Talking up his genius . She just called him " fiendishly brilliant . " What , did she buy a word-of-the-day calendar or something ? What , Hel uses a few big words and all of a sudden she 's - What about at the bar ? She forgets that you have the Voice in your head instead of hers ? And why is she being all formal , calling you " Cleopatra , " when Creegan just called you " Cleo " ? Yeah , you see what I 'm sayin ' ? Just remember what I said . If you 're going to do this , make sure you got the right guy . Final words , Creegan ? " Spend some time in slave chains , see the world through new eyes . " What ? That 's what you told me when I saved you from the slavers that double-crossed you . You said there was more to life down here than squeezing profits from misery . What kind of a trick is this ? I - I don 't think it 's a trick . Cleopatra , that 's enough . Creegan has been found guilty . Carry out his sentence . Yeah ! Do it , now ! I think we need to reopen this case . I order you to be silent . Sarge ! Trust your instincts . Does that sound like the Hel you know ? He told me to keep my eye on you , Hel , and I have . Quite frankly , I don 't think you 've been yourself today . This is absurd . Carry out his execution ! Now ! Yeah . That 's enough ! What ? By my authority as magistrate , I order a 24-hour stay . Return the prisoner to his chambers . Kill the clown . No ! Demolecularization initiated . Evacuate chambers immediately . No ! Hel ! In the end , I 'm glad it turned out this way . I much prefer a firing squad to that humane contraption they had you in . Cleo , get back ! It 's no use , Sarge . The escape countermeasures have been activated . Then override them ! Do it ! Hel ! Hel , can you hear me ? Hel , talk to us ! It 's not workin ' ! Come on ! Nice moves , Helen . You work that body in ways I never thought I could . Must be the female touch . Maybe , I still know my weaknesses which are now your weaknesses . It 's over , Creegan , they know . Knowledge isn 't everything . Got it . Let 's go . Don 't move . No , no , hey , get Creegan ! Creegan ! Oh , I mean , Hel , or whoever that was . Uh . Hel ? Yeah , it 's me . How did he do it ? Creegan smuggled this into his cell inside a hollow tooth . Pretty ingenious . Hel , you were trying to tell me , and ... I 'm sorry I was so slow on the uptake . Forget it . I wouldn 't believe anything that came out of his mouth , either . So this little doohickey can change you back ? I hope so . I really don 't want to spend every day looking at that face . Hey , It 's no picnic being on this side , either . I 'm sure it 's not . Don 't worry . We 'll bring Creegan in . Hey , just tell your men to go easy with those shock batons , huh ? They really sting . Come on , let 's move . Sarge ? Yeah , Voice . Sarge , I still haven 't been able to establish communication with Mauser . And someone has just re-encrypted the lab 's defensive system . He 's in the lab . Okay , Sarge , you go right . Cleo , stay low , go left . Remember , that 's my body in there , so low-power weapons only . Once you pin him down , I 'll move in and make the swap . Let 's go , team . What ? Nothing . Hel ! I wanted to keep this party a little more intimate . So I reprogrammed the door to only admit you . You 're just dragging this out , Creegan . Marla and her men will be here any minute . If I were you , I 'd do everything in my power to keep that from happening . Anyone else comes dragging through that door , and I trigger the lab self-destruct systems . The blast would surely kill all your little friends outside that door and there will be plenty left for Marla and her boys . But the most delicious death of all will be yours , Helen . The last thing you 'll see is your body being blown into a million pieces . Voice , can you override lab door security ? I 'm trying every access code , Sarge . But it 'll take some time . Sarge , do you read me ? Creegan , I mean , Hel . What 's going on in there ? Creegan 's armed the lab auto-destruct . Tell Marla and her men to keep some distance . You 'd better back off , too . I 'm not going to abandon you , Hel . Just do it , Sarge ! What 's this gonna get you , huh ? You blow up the lab and you 'll die , too . What have I got to lose ? Hmm ? You and Marla were only too happy to make my death a public spectacle . No regret , no remorse . Is that justice , Helen ? Or your own lust for vengeance ? You were going to do the same to me . My point exactly . You 've crossed the line . We 're just the same now , you and I. That 's right , Marla . I want you and your men at least 20 levels back till you hear from me . Or until you hear a really loud noise . We 're not leaving ? What do you think ? Voice , any luck with that door ? Only 300 quadrillion possible key combinations to go . Great . Cleo , stay here . Where are you going ? A shielded access vent runs into the lab from the next level up . There 's an auxiliary control station inside . And if I get to it I should be able to shut down the auto-destruct . Sarge , you know that vent is protected by a security force field . I know about the security , Voice . So I 'm gonna need you to help me get through it . Sarge , be careful . We could make a deal . You want your body back . I want mine . You make the switch and I 'll tell Marla that you cooperated and I 'll personally see to it , that you have your death sentence commuted . I thought you wanted to see me fry , Helen ? Come on , now . Don 't wimp out on me . Stick to your convictions ! Whatever happens , you 're not walking out of here . Maybe not , but in the meantime , Mr. Mauser and I have some unfinished business . Oh , I hope I don 't make a mess out of his brain looking for this Voice beacon . Oh , well . Come out , come out , wherever you are . One more step and we go out together . Oh . What happened to the good old days when we could just leave a key under the mat ? I can see the force field , Voice . Can you shut it down ? Yes , but I can only leave the field down for a few seconds without setting off the lab alarms . Is that enough time ? It 'll have to be . Force field deactivation in three , two , one . There 's that Voice beacon . Sarge , take the next right to the control panel . Come to Daddy . Laboratory auto-destruct activated . Now you 've done it . Detonation in one minute , 25 seconds . 1 : 25 , 1 : 24 . Damn it ! 1 : 13 , 1 : 12 , 1 : 11 , 1 : 10 1 : 09 . Cleo , get out of there . I 'm not gonna make it ! I 'm not leaving you guys . 31 , 30 , 29 25 , 24 21 , 20 . Cleo , get out of there , the lab 's going to blow ! 19 , 18 . Not exactly the execution you had in mind , huh , Helen ? 13 , 12 , 11 , 10 9 , 8 , 7 ... Goodbye , Helen . 6 , 5 , 4 3 , 2 , 1 . No . Auto-destruct sequence aborted . Goodbye . Creegan . No . Command : override lab security door . Don 't move , Creegan , or I 'll zap you . Cleo , I 'm Hel ! I 'm not falling for your mind games again . Cleo , no ! You , okay ? Thanks , Cleopatra . Don 't worry , I got him . You are still Creegan , right ? All systems check out . Thank you , Hel . It feels good to be back on-line . Oh , me , too . Although , I do have to say that I 'm a little disappointed in you guys . Excuse me ? Mmm-hmm . We just saved you from being fried . Well , yes , eventually . But I can 't believe you couldn 't tell the difference between myself and a megalomaniacal killer . Now that hurt . Well , Creegan put on a pretty good show . And you have to admit , there is a bit of a tyrant in both of you . Well , don 't get me wrong , I love that about you . Cleo , how are you doing ? Feeling any better ? No . Oh , come on , Cleo . At least you stayed true to your beliefs . No one got executed . Yeah , but I don 't back the catch-and-release program . I just let the baddest guy down here walk . See you . Bye-bye . Be good now , okay ? Cleo , your gut feeling saved Hel 's life . Yes , and it 's true you did manage to let Creegan slip through your fingers today . But , thanks to you , I get to see tomorrow . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries

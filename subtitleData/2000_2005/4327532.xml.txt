Everything looks so gosh different from up here. I can see the whole factory . Can you see Diane in Accounts Receivable ? I believe so . I like the way her leg hair looks all smushed down under her pantyhose . Now that I have limbs , I really can 't listen to that kind of talk . But , Bob- - Wow. I 'm shushing and everything . Bob , Beth says you pushed her off the swing . She was on it forever . You 've always been the sweetest man . I hope those arms and legs aren 't going to your head . You know , I was thinking . There 's one position we 've never done it in . What say I stand and deliver ? Bob , don 't change the- - Race you upstairs ! In your face ! - What the hell are you doing , Oblong ? - Having fun . - Oh , really ? And are you having fun ? - l believe I just said that . Don 't you take that tone with one of your betters .

You 're a hottie , Robbie . Sorry , a little sand in the carburetor . So are you a lifeguard ? Four years on the force . It 's a lot of hard work . Helping people , saving lives , keeping your pubic area waxed . Sounds like a rewarding job . Say , you don 't need any new guards , do you ? We might just have an opening . All right ! You quit your job to become a lifeguard ? Of course. lt 's been my lifelong dream . You 've never mentioned it before . Maybe I don 't tell you everything . For instance , did you know that for a short while I was married to Phylicia Rashad ? That 's not true . But are you certain , absolutely certain ? I prove my point . Anyway , Dusty says I 'm a natural . " Dusty says , Dusty says . " So is she pretty ? Oh , yeah ! I mean , oh , yeah ! Darn. I can 't stop doing that . You can 't be a lifeguard . Your skin 's all white and chalky . And you 're soft , like a woman . Oh , yeah ? Well , Dusty says next year , these guns will be gracing the lifeguard calendar . My birfday , Daddy . Beth , these people are American heroes . Stop putting ketchup on them . Wow . You actually know these people ? Sure , he 's Dogie . Or is he Shredder ? That 's right . Dogie .

Pickles , I want you to meet- - Don 't tell me . You must be Musty . I think you mean " Busty . " - Nice one , dude . - Thanks , dude . I was gonna say Rusty , but then Busty just came to me . Nice bathing suit . How brave to wear horizontal stripes when you got that whole middle-aged spread thing going on . Well , you 're fairly riddled with implants , aren 't you ? Robbie , your family 's gonna have to move along to the valley section . Sorry , honey. it 's the rules . Whatever you say , " Robbie . " - Check it out , ladies . - Yeah , ladies . Why- - ? Why did you frost your hair ? Hey , I 'm going through puberty . Make with the seaweed . Help , help ! Emergency ! They 're blocking my sunlight ! That 's violation 274-A : impeding tan of hill people . Kick it down , Robbie . But , Dusty , they 've built a drawbridge made of used syringes . When a lifeguard has emotions , people die . But it 's just a sandcastle . They die , Robbie ! - Who 's Robbie ? - Sorry. lt pains me to do this . Okay , kids , get your fun on . It 's getting late , Bob . I thought we could all drive home together . Sweetie , I thought I 'd stay for the big campfire . If I wanna move up from trainee , Dusty says I need to put in some face time . To go with her ass time ? Pickles , her rear end doesn 't look that way purely for show . It 's for saving lives . Oh , God . - Can I stay for the campfire ? - Sure . You 're a cutie , just like Robbie . Who the hell is Robbie ? Dusty , you have got quite a little knot back here . It 's probably just some wandering silicone . - You play , Robbie ? - Oh , no. I couldn 't possibly . Having my baby I 'm a woman in love And I love what it 's doin ' to me A sexy woman , yeah Large-breasted , full-hipped woman Who craves a spanking lt 's out of tune . Well , we should call it a night . We 've gotta get up early for the big competition tomorrow . - What competition ? - You don 't know ? The Aussies are coming for the annual Beach Battle Royale . If you win , you 'd automatically graduate to full-fledged lifeguard . Oh , my God . Oh , Bob , I miss you . Let 's make some of that hot , nasty donkey love . Push up on the sternum , short sharp breaths . Sorry , there 's a test on CPR tomorrow . Can the lifeguard crap . Nude me ! Oh , baby , that hurts so good . Actually , that just hurts . Marauding crab ! Clear the beach ! Buddy up ! Sorry , it must 've stowed away in my codpiece . Hey , you blew your whistle . Your TMJ 's gone . You can take the suit off ! - l 'll just keep it on . - l crave torso , baby . Buff , hairless torso . Well , this torso 's got some new appendages , lady . Get used to it . Well , at least you can help Beth blow out the candles on her birthday cake tomorrow . Beth 's birthday is tomorrow ? Well , of course . She 's been talking about it for weeks . Good Lord ! That 's what she meant when she kept saying " birfday . " Oh , this is terrible . Tomorrow 's the big lifeguard competition . - The Aussies are coming . - Oh , Bob if you miss Beth 's birthday party , you 're gonna break her heart . If she 'd just been clear to begin with . You 've changed , Bob . No , I haven 't . And my name is Robbie now . See , isn 't this fun , getting ready for your daughter 's birthday party ? Better than some old lifeguard competition any day . Abso-tively . Okay , all done icing the cake . Bob , this says " castrating she-beast , " and there 's an arrow pointing to me . Okay , I admit it . I wanna be in the lifeguard competition . It 's the chance of a lifetime to earn the respect of my peers . - What about the respect of your family ? - Oh , please . Bob , if those legs walk out of here with you , you 're gonna hate yourself . Don 't worry. I 'll be back in time . Daddy , aren 't you coming to my birfday party ? I wouldn 't miss it for the world . I promise . And I 'm gonna win . I hate those Aussies so much . Bob , you 've never even met an Australian . Thanks . There goes my psych-up . Good day , scumbags . No worries , that 's Australian for comrades . Look , could we just get on with it ? Some of us have birfday parties to attend . Hold on , mate . You know we can 't go in the water until 45 minutes after we eat . - l thought it was 30 minutes . - Not in Australia , douchebag . - l suppose that means " friend . " - No , it means " douchebag . " Stop eating . This is the best birfday ever . Now I 've got salve , ointment and balm for my head thingy . Okay , joke 's over . Where 's my dolls , my jump rope and my new watch ? Little girls don 't get presents when they act greedy . You forgot where you put them , didn 't you ? Who wants cake ? Can I blow out the candles ? I 've been holding my breath for 77 minutes . - Shouldn 't we wait for Dad ? - Yeah , we . He 'll be here soon . He promised . I can 't wait to see you kick some Aussie butt . It 's been an hour . He could 've digested a family of kangaroos by now . Guess I 'm about ready to go . - lt 's about time . - Wait . I 've got a little business to attend to down under . This is America . Do it in the ocean . Help ! My metal suit isn 't floating ! Relax , sheila , I got you . Should 've told me you can 't swim , Robbie . I didn 't think it would come up . I believed in you. I trusted you . I let you dip from my Carmex . - l 'm really sorry . - You 're sorry , all right . Oh , Lord. I missed Beth 's birthday party . All because of this stupid contest . How could I have been so selfish ? My family 's never gonna forgive me . We forgive you . Pickles . Oh , darling , I 've been such a jerk . - Yeah , but it 's okay . - But what about Beth ? She must hate my guts . Bob , look down . I love you , Daddy . My baby is hugging me , and I can 't even feel it . Damn these arms and legs . Help ! Dusty 's in danger ! The tide totally swept her in , and I 'm too big to fit through the rocks . I 'm even bigger . Check out these lats , bro . I 'm bigger than both of you . This is how they say " God " in Australia . Boys , remember me ? What should we do ? Only a porpoise , seal or miniature man could fit through there . Robbie , you saved my life . Hey , where 'd your limbs go ? You look like a baby sea cow . Sea cow , you say ? Well , let me tell you something , Miss Dusty . I may not have arms and legs , but I have the one body part that truly matters in a man , and it 's huge . - l 'd like to see that . - Me too . Well , you can 't , because it 's lodged within my ribcage . You see , it 's my heart , Dusty . I think I love you , Robbie . Sorry , babe , the name 's Bob . And the heart is spoken for .

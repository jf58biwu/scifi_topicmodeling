 WARS HAVE RAVAGED THE EARTH 'S ATMOSPHERE ( thunder ) SURVIVOR CAMPS FIGHT FOR WHATEVER SCRAPS OF FOOD REMAIN THE FATE OF THE EARTH WILL SOON BE IN THE HANDS OF ONE MAN Look at what I got . So that 's what you been hiding . Don 't you want to share ? Take it . Just leave me alone . You got family , girl , with anything to trade ? Yes . My daddy has canned goods and gasoline . This little girl 's plump . She 'II feed us for a week . It 's him . I know it 's him . Take the food and let the girl go . I won 't give you a second chance . kill her . ( screaming / thud ) I 'm walkin ' outta here , Garth . Try and stop me , she 's dead . Do you hear me ? Mandy , close your eyes . No ! Wait ! - Your mom was worried about you . - Was it always like this , Garth ? No . The world was once beautiful , baby . But we betrayed her and she turned her back on us . - will she ever forgive us ? - Yeah . When we 've learned our lesson . OK . Open her up . Mandy ! - Look , Mom . I found bread . - Where have you been ? I have been worried sick . I found her about six blocks south of here . - Thank you . - Mom , look . Bread . Yeah . Put that away now , OK ? One of the hunters found meat . And we have stew . ( laboured breathing ) ( gasps ) Take it easy . - It won 't be long now . - Don 't talk like that . It 's the truth and we both well know it . - What have you got there ? - We got us some soup . Van Owen says he killed a coyote . He brought the meat in already butchered . There 's no coyotes left . Not even in the canyons . killed six men today . Three over this and three over the Parker girl . - Things are getting worse . - As if that were possible . Drop ' em . Or you 're dead . Lapierre . Long time . I 'm afraid you would have been disappointed . We ain 't got much . I ain 't come for what you have . In fact , we brought gifts . Peaches . They 're real ! You didn 't come for food . What did you come here for ? You . - What did he want ? - A meeting . Between me and a man named Reich . Anton Reich . - Says he works for him . In some capacity . - Lapierre only works in one capacity . - Are you going ? - I don 't see the harm in it . Famous last words . I didn 't know there were any of these things left running . You 'd be surprised what 's left if you know the right people . ( solemn organ music ) - Do you Iike Bach , Major ? - Yeah , it 's all right . His peers considered him to be the supreme master of counterpoint , best evidenced by this toccata and fugue in D minor . additionally he sired 20 children . Some men do lead prodigious lives . Take your father , for instance . general Thomas Garth . Leader of the melbourne invasion of ' 66 . Commanded the NATO alliance . Sired one John Thomas Garth . enlisted at 16 . Joined delta Force a year later . Distinguished combat record , Taipan wars . Two purple Hearts , a Service Cross and the congressional medal of Honor . - A truly excellent rèsumè , Major . - I 'm not a major any more . I 'm just a man trying to survive . Like everyone else . Anton Reich . Are you hungry ? What I have is not steak or lobster , but it is hot and filling . See to it . - You knew him before the fall ? - Yeah , he was a ranger . - But you were adversaries . - Competitors . He had his way , I had mine . And whose was best ? - What is it you want , Mr Reich ? - Your skill , obviously . - I want to hire you . - To do what ? Can you guess what it is I did before the fall ? - I don 't know . Businessman . - You can do better than that , Major . Your clothes were handcrafted in Europe , but it 's the crest on your cufflinks that says Austrian aristocracy . This facility was systematised before the fall . Which shows your foresightedness . You surround yourself with paramilitary , but you can control them . I would guess you ran a conglomerate or a Iarge enterprise . Bravo , Major . That 's true enough . But my passion , my real passion , is not nearly so transparent . Art ? Art is more than just brush strokes against canvas . It 's the epitome of human existence . 10 % of the world 's greatest pieces lie within a five-miIe radius of where we are . I want you to retrieve for me as much of it as you can . tell me , have you heard of the Vincent Estate ? Sure . In the valley , in the SepuIveda Pass . built by some billionaire recluse . Rumoured to be the most heavily secured building in the US . The rumours are true , I can assure you . I 've sent several contingents up there to investigate . None have returned . What makes you think it hasn 't been looted too ? I knew Vincent . We were also competitors . In the years before his seclusion he began work on a formidable security system . - Use Lapierre . He 's good enough . - He can handle heavy stuff . But he 's a soldier . He could never have seen me the way you did in there . - How 's it powered ? - By nuclear reactor . modelled after the one here at UCLA . And if I succeed ? AII the food , ammunition and goods your people could desire . Living out of a sewer doesn 't suit you , Major . Eating rats and God knows what else . I 'm giving you an opportunity to reclaim your dignity . What do you say ? Vincent Estate is protected by surface-to-air missiles . Anything that comes near the place goes up in smoke . - You tried it ? - Of course . The grounds are protected by shadow battle units . You telling me you can 't send something in there and remote-detonate it ? The walls are made from blended armour . Even if we could , Mr Reich doesn 't want to risk damaging the collection . - tell him . - There 's something else . encrypt . We 're not sure what the acronym stands for . Before the fall Mr Reich 's people downloaded some transmissions detailing a security program that oversees the entire state . - What kind of program ? - The sentient kind . - Is there any good news ? - Yes . You won 't be going in alone . Hernandez . She 's been a shadow on every corner of the world . Never been a recon better . If there 's a crack in the wall , she can slip inside . King . Ex-Marine sniper . 39 confirmed kills . If he can see it , he can shoot it . - Nobody handles the heavy stuff better . - What heavy stuff ? - Pray you never find out , little sister . - Edershaw . - Best tech man in 36 states . - Except florida . There 's a key man who lives there . calls himself The shawl . He 's good . real good . - He 's odd , but he gets the job done . - call me The Poet . Everybody does . - That 's your team ? - No . Lapierre 's going in too . Save it . Whatever past you two have , leave it there . You 're professionals . For a chance to pull this off , you 'II need each other . - You 're assuming I 'm in . I haven 't agreed . - That 's right . You haven 't , have you ? Coumadin and warfarin . 50mg of anticoagulant injections . For those blood clots in your father 's legs , correct ? - Is there anything you don 't know ? - Our chance of success . I don 't do anything till the food and the medicine are delivered . half now and half when the operation is completed . And I am in total command . - That is the entente . - I haven 't heard him say it . You just do your job , Garth . I 'II do mine . Unbeknownst to many , Vincent Industries was also creating combat systems . The estate is protected by platforms inside and out . So not your first foray . Who went in ? You ? No . Leon Vega . Vega ? Where is he ? Dead . But he got further than anyone before , if that 's of any condoIence . - Ever worn force-fieId armour before ? - No . It was introduced during the Iast days of the Pentagon . They 're Iithium-battery operated . These read-outs tell you your count . generally speaking , the armour is good for 100 rounds of 5.56 or 75 rounds of 7.62 . Grenades and pulse weapons will take a toll of between 10 and 100 points depending on proximity of impact . - Does everyone follow ? - Yes , sir . This is a battery pack . It holds 20 additional battery units . Each isolated to prevent current overflow . Change batteries between firefights or whenever it becomes depleted . Some units may protect past the hundred mark , but I wouldn 't count on it . should have gone with the Energizers . Mr King . would you step away from the others ? gentlemen and Hernandez , you might want to step back . - glancing rounds will deflect . - Wait a minute . Son of a bitch . It is advisable to seek cover when being fired upon . while rounds can 't penetrate , the force can disorientate and render the recipient unconscious . I 've avoided the head and certain appendages for demonstration purposes . Without the armour , they are vulnerable . Mr King , you 've just taken 90 direct hits . normally one would have been enough to kill you . How do you feel ? - swell . - Good . Thank you for participating . - Keeps going and going and ... - Shut up . You got good taste . The pulse rifle has a punch of 50 with almost no recoil . It uses the same batteries as the armour , 50 rounds of decreasing intensity . - You can also use it for regular firepower . - Downside ? - The barrel can overheat and fracture . - Guess that 's acceptable . - About Vega ... - Save it . He knew the risks . Just like we do . Radio signals are jammed inside the estate . But it will work once it powers down . Get over to the central atrium then down to the second sub-fIoor . Shut the nuke down , then head outside and give me a call . I 'II come in . I wish you luck , Major . Lapierre . Shadow units ! Where are they coming from ? I can 't get a lock . Cease fire ! Don 't fire unless you see something . Stop wasting ammo . Where are they coming from ? I can 't get a lock . Check the footprints in the snow . Is that it ? Are they all gone ? Going thermal . Edershaw . Behind you . - Count-off . Hernandez . - alive and kicking , sir . - King . A-OK . - Lapierre . Everyone 's cool . Let 's move . Move it . ( beeping ) - Fire in the hole . - Wait , wait , wait . " Fortune always leaves some doors open . " Cervantes . ( slamming ) ( Edershaw ) " Into a closed mouth no files will enter . " No defensive platforms . The doors behind me lead to the housing wings . - We want the far end . - But behind those doors ? - That 's where the fun begins . - Hernandez . How 's your impact rating ? - Cherry , sir . How 's yours ? - Peachy . Let 's move . On the other side there 's no stepping back . The team 's going to look to you . - Body , three o 'cIock . - Put your hands up . - Edershaw , perimeter . - AII clear . - Stop where you are . Don 't move . - I have the shot . - Negative . She 's unarmed . - On your face , lady , now . I said eat the floor , now . - Team . On me . - ( Garth ) Lapierre , wait . That wasn 't very smart , was it ? By the look of you , I suspect intelligence is an undervalued commodity . It 's a hologram . You are all intruders here , but your damage is limited to the outside . I 'm sure if you flee now , a fuII-scaIe pursuit will not ensue . - Lapierre , is it ... - encrypt ? I think so . shall we take it out ? - No . Reich seemed to intimate it ... - Stop ! Stop referring to me as " it " ! My name is Diana , gentlemen . You might be thieves , but you needn 't be discourteous ones . - Diana ? - That 's correct . And you are ? Moving on . Have I mentioned the police are on their way ? - There are no police any more . - What do you mean ? - Projection point . - please . Don 't fire again . - I 'm only trying to help you . - I got it . If you destroy my apparatus I will have no choice but to take appropriate measures . If you could shut all women up with a push of a button it 'd be a perfect world . - Appropriate measures ? - I don 't see the sky falling . Gas ! Hit the floor . I can 't breathe . King . Put your mask on . Come on . Get it on . - I 'm all right . - You were saying ? If gas is all they 've got , this is going to be a breeze . I 'm inclined to disagree with you . Wait . please . Let me speak . Am I correct in assuming you are in charge ? - No . You are . - You won 't reach what you 're after . From this point on I will be unable to aid you as I did with the shadow units and the gas . - Aid us ? What is she talking about ? - If you Iike , you can remove your masks . It 's quite safe now . May I remind you , I am the guardian of this facility , yet I still value human life . But even my security protocols have backups . - I don 't know where the police are . - There are no police any more . - And the world ? - Is gone . At least as your programmers perceived it . - You might wish the police had come . - Is that right ? This facility is defended by an upgrade of a Vincent Embassy Protection System . In case you 're too ignorant to know what that means : lethal defence systems . - killing machines . - ( cocks weapon ) You 've been warned . Great , we 've been warned . Now can we get moving or what ? hello , boys and girls . My name is Diana . - I 'm the chief of security . - What the hell is this ? - I 'm your guide . - It 's it again . - No , it 's something different . - Who can tell me who Mr Vincent is ? - She was once human . - ( laughs ) - I don 't know about the richest man ... - King triggered an old hoIograph of her . The Mr Vincent I know loves art more than anything else in the world and has built this residence so it could be converted into a museum and all these beautiful paintings you see on the walls could find a home . - Looks clear . - Make sure . What was that ? Theodore Vincent was quite the philanthropist . He didn 't see his accumulation of art as possessory . unlike most collectors of his era , his was not locked away in a room or buried in a safety deposit box , but displayed here for all to see . His hospitality sure has made an impact on all of us . - You deny you 're here to steal ? - No . although my clients would describe it differently . - Repatriate . - Yeah . Something like that . Did you know him ? Before he died ? Yes . He was like a father to me . And to many others , Mr Garth . - What ? What is it ? - You called me Garth . My sensors are finely tuned . I can pick up all audible conversations , body language , physiological changes , reflections of truth , dishonesty and more . For instance , I know you would rather not be here . - Do you ? - And I know that you 're a good man , as evidenced by an exemplary military record , lack of criminal record and social achievements by your wife and offspring . I see this is an uncomfortable subject for you . - I apologise for the interjection . - It was a Iong time ago , Diana . Before they made machines like you . Major . I think you want to see this . What do you make of this ? Some kind of puzzle ? Diana , is this a trap ? Vincent 's dead and he took the civilised world with him . There 's a man out there willing to carry on his legacy . - If you value human life , you 'II help us . - I 'm sorry , Major Garth . But I 'm afraid that 's not my prime directive . - Getting tired of her voice anyway . - Heard that . Can 't be too hard . In my experience puzzles like this are easy . Like riddles . - It 's a riddle wrapped in a mystery ... - ( all ) Shut up , Edershaw . The question is ... where do we start ? How about the beginning ? - Be careful , King . - It 's OK , Hernandez . I know the way . ( groans ) Are you hurt ? No , negative . Armour protected me . - well , that rules that out . - No , there 's got to be a trick . - Nobody could memorise these numbers . - We could ask Diana , but she ain 't talking . Maybe she already did . She said helping us wasn 't her prime directive . - So ? - It seems like a robotic response . If she doesn 't want to be regarded as a robot , why say that ? So it 's a clue . - Prime numbers . - What ? A number only divisible by itself and one . - 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 ... - 1 1 . - 12 . - No . - 13 , 1 7 , 19 . - OK , Hernandez . - So give it a shot . - Yes , sir . - Yes ! - AII right . AII right , Mr Poet , it 's your turn . We all know what Shakespeare said . " Courage mounteth with occasion . " That 's right , Mr Bard . Now mounteth your ass over here . Let 's go . " It is better to be the widow of a hero than a wife of a coward . " Ibarruri . What the hell 's he talking about ? VirgiI . " Fortune favours the bold . " What ? Don 't tell me you guys don 't like VirgiI . Edershaw . Don 't turn around . Edershaw , move . - Hernandez ? - Don 't have the shot . Let 's move . - I warned you . - That you did . - And now you plan to continue on ? - We do . I don 't understand your actions , John Garth . They 're not consistent with the data I have retrieved on you . Perhaps the outside world has moved on . Perhaps you 're not the same man who earned those commendations of valour . - You disappoint me , John . - You wouldn 't be the first . King , Hernandez , secure perimeter . How are we , Major ? As far as I can tell , ahead of schedule . This is the Iast room before we make our descent into the sub-fIoors . No , I meant how are you doing ? Fine . Other than losing one of my soldiers ... fine . Good . I 'd hate to think that all the psychobabble that talking polaroid has turned your way might be sinking in . - You 've a problem with how I lead things ? - I 'm just concerned . - Are you ? - You 've always been a good soldier . A little too Ione wolf for my taste , but you got the job done . - I just don 't see how this encrypt ... - You mean Diana . ( laughs ) Diana . Is doing us any good . In fact , I think she might be playing on your sense of morality . And if it is ? Then we may have to re-evaIuate the chain of command . Let me tell you something . I signed up to lead this mission and I 'II see it through . morality and conscience mean little when set against a camp full of hungry people . My people . So you don 't concern yourself with my actions , Captain . The room is secure , Major . The stairwell door 's barred shut . It 's going to take an hour to get through . OK . Hernandez , can you manage up some grub ? Are you asking me because I 'm a woman ? I 'm asking you cos the thought of King 's cooking scares the hell out of me . I 'II dig something up . Diana . - Yes , John ? - So it 's John now , is it ? What was this room ? This was the Greek gallery . It encompassed art from the early classical period from 480 BC to the hellenistic age of 323 BC . It was my favourite . Why is that ? Because the principal subjects of Greek sculpture were gods . Heroes of legend and maidens intended to demonstrate ideals of beauty . You were a romantic . ironically , the piece I most enjoyed was situated where you now stand . - What was it ? - It was an older piece . A skilfully modelled terracotta centaur made about 900 BC at Lefkandi on the island of Euboea . Mr Vincent acquired it from the Louvre before Paris burned the second time . - Why was it your favourite , Diana ? - It was a simple piece . But no matter how many times I gazed at it , I always found something new . " Beauty is in the eye of the beholder . " If Edershaw was alive , I 'm sure he could tell us who said that . Margaret WoIfe Hungerford . Ah . A romantic and a poet . No . As you pointed out , just a machine . I wish that I couId have seen it . I wish you could turn back . But since you will not , you should rest your eyes . You 're weary . This gallery is called the Greek Room because all the antiquities displayed here originated in classical times . Does anyone know what classical means ? Yes . classical means pre-Christian , or before the rise of Christianity . Note this statue of Agamemnon , whose sister-in-Iaw helen was stolen by Paris , son of Priam , king of Troy . And so started the Trojan War . - Gear 's all set , Major . - Batteries charged ? Yes , sir . OK . Let 's do it . Diana . Can you tell us about the security in the stairwell ? - I can 't . - Does that mean there is none ? That means I cannot reveal any features installed to prohibit you from your illegal activities . It would be counterproductive to my mission . - Her mission is to see us all get killed . - That is not correct , SaIia Hernandez . - I do not want to see any of you die . - Any of us ? Or just John ? - Any of you . I value human life . - And your boss , Vincent . Did he value it when he installed these machines to protect his trinkets ? - We never expected to need them . - Or to kill anyone ? - Of course not . - Then we should be dodging blanks now . - You were Vincent 's chief of security . - Yes . It 's funny . You don 't strike me as someone who winds up being chief of security . It 's a little late to start quibbling over qualifications . - You and Vincent were friends . - Are you insinuating something ? - He 's insinuating you 're good-Iooking . - It 's not a new observation . You and Vincent were lovers , he rewarded you . I hope your deaths are quick and painless . Not the send-off I was hoping for . - What is that , gas ? - Steam . - Must be near the boiler . - Or the nuke . intel says the nuke is on the next floor down . Yeah ? well , what 's on this floor ? ( buzzing ) - What the hell is that ? - Defensive positions . - Does anyone see anything ? - Negative . Hernandez , go night vision . Negative , sir . Nothing 's out there . twelve o 'cIock ! Lay off ! What the hell are you shooting at ? I thought I saw something , sir . Diana ! Diana , are you here ? A woman scorned , Major . - Sir ? - Does everybody see that ? - Does anyone know what the hell it is ? - Ghosts . Rounds go right through these things . How can we shoot them ? - Have we got any intel on these things ? - Negative . - hold your fire ! - What is it , Major ? - I want to try something . - We got you . It 's like I thought . They 're holograms , Iike our friend , only this one 's formless , Iike a ghost . - A hologram . - Like Diana . Where 's the projection coming from ? ( grunts ) It got the major ! - Major , you all right ? - How is he ? Took a lickin ' , still tickin ' . Wrist counter 's at 43 . - 12 o 'cIock ! - hold your fire . Stop wasting ammo . They 're ground units . Wait for the buzz then shoot at the ground beneath them . - Good shooting , sir . - Three o 'cIock . They 're everywhere . - This isn 't working . - Don 't let them get a lock on you . Come on . Get some ! ( buzzing and clanking ) Garth , behind you . Heat . They 're tracking us by heat . Use your flares . OK . Now . Fire . - Is that it ? Did we get ' em all ? - hell , yes we did ! - Quick thinking . Good work . - You too . King , check this out . My daddy said it 's better to be lucky than good . Ain 't it beautiful when you 're both ? You see me moving out there ? No ! - It 's the Iast one . How did we miss it ? - Hernandez . - Baby , you all right ? - ( gasps ) I 'm good , King . I 'm good to go . Just give me a sec . Changing my battery . No , you just rest , Hernandez . You done good . Just take a little rest . - Don 't go on without me , sir . - No . We won 't . If you do ... who 's going to do the ... cooking ? - Where 's Hernandez ? - She didn 't make it . I 'm sorry . I thought the steam venting might disable the units , as it did my equipment . - apparently I was wrong . - Yeah , you were wrong . And now Hernandez is dead . So you got what you wanted . I never wanted anyone dead . I told you from the beginning , you cannot defeat the security systems . - They 're insurmountable . - You are the security systems . No . I 'm the chief of security , not the system itself . - If we went back , you 'd clear the way ? - Of course , but ... Then clear the way in front of us . Stand down the security protocols . I can 't . The defensive equipment is linked to my autonomic nervous system . - I can no more do it than stop breathing . - You 're not breathing . You 're a machine . We 're wasting time . I do not believe you are in this for the recovery of art . My sensors indicate neither dislike or favour for it . You had a discussion with Captain Lapierre about your people needing food . Spying bitch . Forget her . Has the world really relapsed to a point where food , the most basic of human needs , is worth such a premium ? John , has the world truly devolved to this ? Yes . And your employer - has he made an agreement with you regarding food for the people you care for ? - It 's playing with you . - Shut up , Lapierre . - Yeah . Food and medicine . - I will supply it for you . I can tell you where there 's food . Tons of it . Earthquake supplies . Wafers , cakes , water , coffee ... - Medicine ? - Yes . She 's lying . John , if I supply you with the whereabouts of these things , will you turn back from this quest you are on ? will you , John ? - No . I can 't . - Why not ? - Cos I made an agreement . - Do you always keep your agreements ? Is there any condition under which this contract might be broken ? - only if the other side breaks it first . - This puts me at a disadvantage . I would Iike to help you . I would Iike to see you survive . But by your own admission you seek to terminate me . I may be a machine , John , but I was once alive . And now this image before you is all I have left . - It 's an illusion . - Isn 't all life an illusion ? Vincent Enterprises developed a way to move my consciousness into a computer because my body was diseased . I was dying . - It 's playing on your sympathies . - There 's a basic need for survival . That 's how I know I 'm still human , John . Even in this form I can still breathe . would you take that away from me ? Just tell us where the command corridor is . The command corridor ? I thought you were looking to shut down the power . I am . We are . Isn 't that where the nuke controls are ? No . They 're in the energy control room . Your intel would have disclosed that . If our intel disclosed everything , Diana , we would have prevented you from killing Hernandez and Edershaw . You 're heading into the residence . After that there will be no turning back . In this very corridor there is an escape feature which I can activate and which will catapult you to the rear garden . If you choose this feature , I can tell you how to retrieve the earthquake supplies . There is no shame in accepting this . It is the wiser choice for those you care for . please don 't go in there . I don 't want to see you die . John ? - This was Vincent 's residence ? - Yes . He was a ... modest man . He was a wacko . I 've seen better rooms in motel 6 . When a man of Mr Vincent 's stature dedicates himself to creating a museum of our species ' greatest masterpieces , he has little time for seIf-induIgent comforts . He spent less than four hours a day here , and only then to sleep . only then ? Seems Vincent 's rèsumè wasn 't limited to ... procurer . - What about connoisseur ? - Now that 's some fine art ! I 'm not ashamed of it . We 're going to look for the stairwell down to the second sub-fIoor . King . I was a graduate student at UCLA . - Mr Vincent ... - You can drop the Mr now . I 'II call him any damn thing I want . He pursued me to model for him . finally I relented . Was he that good or were you that good ? Mr Vincent 's interest in me exceeded the professional . He was in love with me . I never returned the affection . - You 're lying . - What ? He bought you with a job . Expect me to believe he didn 't buy the rest of you ? You son of a bitch . Vincent wasn 't the kind of guy that didn 't get what he wanted . - unless ... - unless what ? When you were diagnosed as terminal did you get a second opinion ? - Of course . - Not from one of Vincent 's doctors ? - No . What are you implying ? - He wanted you , didn 't he ? He got to keep you young and beautiful . His one-of-a-kind super-computer . Never to grow old , never to die ... immortal . And his . Forever . Garth . Major . You should see this . - tell him what you told me . - It 's titanium alloy . If we use a standard laser , it 'd take a week to get through . - Can we blow it ? - Not this close to the nuke . Seen a couple of these over the years . Creator built them to withstand anything . But there 's a flaw . Hinging mechanisms buckle under heat . So if we create the heat I need using the plasma cutter , we can take it down . - Time ? - A few hours at Ieast . - Get on it . - It 's a two-man job . Get back to the residence . We 'II come get you when we 're done . Garth . You done good so far . ( groans ) - That will require some attention . - I hate it when you do that . - You 'd rather I leave ? - You 'II do as you wish . - I know why you 're really here . - Do you ? Because of them . elaine and Christopher . - How do you know their names ? - Of your wife and son ? I 've seen them . Or recordings of them . The national security computer 's still up . Mr Vincent has a key . The satellite communication system is still working . Show me . During your last security clearance review they shot some film of your family . You two look wonderful together . See ? I can understand why you 're doing this . They 're not real . They 're not real any more . What happened ? During the breakdown we were visiting EIaine 's mother . My father , he lives on the East Side . I went to get him . There were riots . The whole city was on fire . people were killing each other . It took me days to get back . And by the time I did they were gone . - So you never learned . - I 'm a soldier . I face the truth . I know they 're dead . But in your heart ... You want to make sure . John ... On the desk there 's a pair of VR glasses . Put them on . please . For me . John ? I know you 're out there , John . They 're coming this way . We can 't stay any longer . I 've used the Iast of Mom 's jewellery to secure us passage on a ship . We 're heading north . It 's the best I can do for them now . I know you 'II follow and I know you 'II find us . We 're survivors , John . Just like you . Don 't give up on us . It 's gotten bad , John . The storm started two days ago and it hasn 't let up . - elaine . - We can 't get to shore . I 'm afraid , John . I 'm so afraid . Knowing you 're out there means we 're still alive . You get that , don 't you , John ? This may be the end for me , but not for us . Be strong , my love . Know we love you . And as long as you 're alive with memories of us , as long as it burns within you , we will always be together . elaine , don 't go . ( static ) ( sighs ) Thank you . Thanks for that . I know what you are after . - Ignore her . - You won 't reach it . ( laughs ) - You sound like a broken record . - If you go down there , I can 't protect you . Protect us ? You don 't think you 've defeated all the security systems by yourself , do you ? - What if I had sent them all at once ? - blah , blah , blah . Listen to me , Captain . Downstairs is different . The computer room is down there , along with the weapons storage bays . There 's a stand-aIone system down there , fully automated . A killing machine . Get back to work . It 's called the Rook . It was designed to replace soldiers on the battlefield . It 's dormant now , but as soon as your heat signature reads on the bottom floor the Rook will activate and kill you . - Shut up . - I 'm asking you ... I said shut up ! I don 't wanna hear any more of your lies . If you continue in this manner , I 'II have to tell Major Garth what you 're truly after . - ( King ) What 's she talking about ? - I said mind your work . please . Reconsider . No . John . John ! Lapierre 's gone . I couldn 't stop him . King ! - King ! - Yeah . - Lapierre took off . - There 's something you should know . - The captain is not after Mr Vincent 's art . - What , then ? Before his death Mr Vincent had created a microorganism transmitted by seeds , capable of returning the ozone layer to its previous state within a decade . global warming will be reduced and the earth will be reborn . - Why didn 't he release it , then ? - The system had been sabotaged . By the time it was repaired Vincent had died and I alone could not activate it . - Who were the saboteurs ? - Trusted associates working for a man who had created a food substitute . Anton Reich . encrypt , this is Diana 1 716 theta theta 6 . - Rook activation override . Cease now . - You are not authorised . - Emergency override . cancel activation . - You are not authorised . - How do we stop this thing ? - You can 't . The Rook is a fully autonomous operative . Its body armour is five times more effective than the armour you wear now . - It can destroy anything in this facility . - Everything has a weakness . - The Rook doesn 't . - Where 's Lapierre ? In the command corridor . Right now he 's talking with Mr Reich by radio . They 're attempting to raise the pod seed mechanisms so they may be recovered . Son of a bitch wants more compensation . We have to activate that technology , or ... - Go . I 'II handle the Rook . - You can 't . It 's a rook . I 'm a king . I 'II checkmate its ass . Go save the world . ( King cries out ) He 's taken the remote detonator unit . The pod terminals have risen . Major . Stings like a bitch , don 't it ? Captain , you can 't beat the Rook . Never could stand that haughty broad . talking about Vincent like he 's a humanitarian , when he 's no better than any other rich bastard looking for a martyrdom legacy . - Why ? - You 're asking me why , Major ? The world went from ten billion to less than a million . And what 's left but false hope and real estate ? The pods will be released eventually . But first Reich will have his organic food empire . - And I 'II be the general that runs it . - Are you nuts ? - Reich 's going to burn you . - Reich needs me . He 's got the vision but I am the implementation . And when he 's gone ... Chopper four , whisky papa . Lapierre , come in . - Go ahead . - Can you confirm deactivation ? Roger that . SAMs are offline . You 're clear to land . Repeat , clear to land . Understood . Whisky papa out . - I can 't let you do it . - You can 't ? How are you going to stop me ? I got your pulse rifle . Diana 's taking a nap somewhere . You 've lost . What makes you think you could stop me ? - Cos I know something you don 't . - Yeah ? And what 's that ? You can 't fight the Rook alone . The Rook is just another one of your girlfriend 's inventions . Oh , yeah ? Why don 't you tell that to King ? You 're going to be seeing him soon . - It 's real . - Yeah , he 's real . real pissed off . You got one chance . That 's us fighting it together . No way . I give you back the rifle , you frag me . Think of the consequences . I can 't beat the thing alone . And I got to stay alive for my old man . What do you say , Captain ? What do you say ? Lapierre ! Your armour . Put it on him . I 'II shoot the battery pack . No ! Do it . Now ! Good work , Major . ( gasps and coughs ) ( groans ) You found me . - Are you ... ? - Yes . The disembodiment process is a one-sided feature . Once the neural energy is transferred there is no going back . Then why ? Theodore Vincent wanted my body as much as my mind . - That 's him ? - Yes . Near the end his health began to diminish . He had plans to join me in immortality , but he made one crucial error . - What 's that ? - He underestimated me . He thought his files were encrypted and that I would never learn the truth . The truth you so acutely guessed . I wasn 't dying , you see , after all . It was all a ruse . A ruse to possess me , to enslave me . In the end it was his love for technology that betrayed him . A simple camera in a simple room during a simple conversation . You were justified . - Was I ? - Mm . For 20 years I 've lived in a prison . alone . Did I murder him or save him a life of hell , just like mine ? Not much of a choice . No . It 's not . No . I would live in here with you a thousand times over . But you are not dead , John Garth . You don 't have to make the choice . In fact , you still have some work to do . Lapierre is almost at the courtyard where the pod seed cannons are . Let me show you another way . Hurry . Going somewhere ? You just don 't quit . Hoo-wah . Vega was the same way . When he learned what we wanted to do , he tried to walk away . Issue of morality . Had to shoot him down like a dog . Do I have to do the same to you ? only if you want to go to hell with me . What 's it going to take , Garth ? I don 't imagine you 're going to let us walk out of here with this . You want it ? Come get it . I wasn 't hoping for anything less . Now we know , huh ? That was for Vega . well done , Major Garth . well done . Lapierre told me you were good , but I didn 't expect that good . It 's too bad really . I couId have used your experience . Oh , well . There 's always survivors eager to make a buck . really that 's what I want to do . Mankind will be served , but only after I do some business first . I won 't let you do it . You 're bleeding to death , Major . You can 't move . How can you stop me ? With the push of a button . You 're quite the mess , John Garth . I 'm dying . ( whispers ) No . Not yet . ( groans ) ( thunder ) Somebody 's at the gate . What is it , general ? salvation . What is it ? What do you see ? A new day .

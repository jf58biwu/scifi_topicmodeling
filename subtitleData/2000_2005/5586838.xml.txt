 The Luck of the Fryfish - Push , Mrs. Fry . You 're almost there . - Squeeze one out for America , honey . Keep it down , it 's the 9th inning . Here 's the 0-2 pitch to Crypool . He 's called on a strike three . Swing the bat , you bum ! - It 's a boy with red hair . - You saying my son 's a commie ? And Groady leans into the pitch . It hits him . The Mets win . This is the happiest day of my life . - Here 's your baby . - Okay , thanks . - What should we name him ? - You pick . I picked dinner . I was thinking of Philip , after those screwdrivers . That 's a fantastic idea . More morphine , please ! - Look , Yancy , it 's baby Philip . - I wanna be named Philip . Me Philip ! Me Philip ! Son , your name is Yancy , just like me , and my grandfather and so on . All the way back to minuteman Yancy Fry who blasted commies in the American Revolution . Philip , until I find a suitable model of an ICBM you 'll have to make do fearing this toy spacecraft . Mine ! Mine ! - Come on ! - Baby needs new shoes . To hell with your baby . I need those shoes . It 's a dead heat . They 're checking the electron microscope . The winner is Number Three in a quantum finish . No fair ! You changed the outcome by measuring it . - How did you do , Fry ? - I 'll tell you when my horse finishes . Bad . We owned four horses and two jockeys . We just put a jockey out to stud . He 's perfect for you . Hey , baby , ever do it in a suitcase ? Look , it 's a centaur race . Come on , come on ! Hey , Leela , how about a kiss for good luck ? I meant tongue luck . The winner is Number Four , Steven . I 've run over black cats that were luckier than me . Get your hot horse-burgers , horse-fries , horse-cakes and shakes . - Tongue straight from the horse 's mouth . - It all sounds good . All our horses are 1 00 % horse-fed for that double juiced-in goodness . I 'll have a cholesterol-free omelet with horse-beaters . - How can I horse you , sir ? - I 'll have a horse Coke . - Horse Pepsi okay ? - Neigh ! - Hey ! What are you doing ? - This . Dear Horse God , I don 't usually pray . Sometimes I doubt you even exist . But if you 're willing to grant me luck , please , stamp your hoof once . Come on , Number Six . Move it ! Don 't do that . What are you ... ? It 's contagious . And the winner is Harry Trotter by the entire racetrack . That 'll teach those horses to take drugs . That 's it ! You can only take my money for so long before you take it all . I say , enough ! I 've got one dollar left , and this one I 'm holding on to . Oh , no , you don 't . I may not know about horses , but I know lots about doing anything for $ 1 . If you think bad luck can defeat me , you don 't know my name is Philip J ... That is one unlucky guy . Kareem has the sky hook , but Philip J. Fry has the space hook . Yancy drives , he goes up with his patented space hook . Hey ! That 's my patented space hook . You stole it . You 're not the president of it . Holy camolie ! A seven-leaf clover . I 'm dying of old age ! Game over ! Phil wins . Yancy 's fans are stunned . There 'll be no celebration at the Yancy Dome . Lucky ! Someone 's in a good mode . Let 's say I lucked out at the track . Also I rigged one race . I 'd have won too , if I still had my seven-leaf clover . Plus , I 'd still have my hair . I got your page , Mr. Fry . Your new hair is ready . What happened to this clover ? I hid it in a secret place and never told anyone . Not even Scruffy . - So is it still in the hiding place ? - Yeah , maybe it is still there . In the ruins of Old New York . Helping one ant defeat another . - Or giving luck to a piece of dirt . - Dirt doesn 't need luck . I 'm going to get my clover back ! Some of the tunnels have metal bars . Who 's good at bending ? - How about you ? - Sure . - But Bending 's my middle name . - It is ? Yep . My full name is Bender Bending Rodriguez . Here 's the entrance . From this moment , I declare my bad luck officially over . He was fun . If we get bored looking for the clover , I 've got Tetris on this thing . - Look , up ahead . - Old New York . The city that inspired a casino in Las Vegas . We 've got Manhattan all to ourselves . I can finally do the crazy stuff I always dreamed . Howard Stern is overrated . - Oops ! - New York is so burned . Remember when Giuliani cracked down on jaywalking ? Well , Rudy , how do you like this action ? The big breakdance battle is Saturday . If we wanna win Jam Master Jay 's parachute pants our crew has to pop , lock and bust the freshest . Noticeably F.A.T. , drop us a beat . - Name ? - Cosmic F. - Style ? - Outer space . - Special moves ? - The moonwalk . The robot . The zero G. - Name ? - Cosmic Y. - Style ? - Deep Space . Deep Space ? ! - Special moves ? - The space-walk . - The robot . - That 's similar to mine . The zero G. - You totally ripped off my routine . - You calling me a biter ? Why do you always have to steal everything from me , Yancy ? - Stop illing . Word . - I 'd like to see you steal this : The septuple head-spin ! He 's just scratching . No one 's done more than a quadruple . Oh , yeah ? Noticeably F.A.T. , rewind the tape . Crazy sucker . - Phil , you 're hot . - That was ice-cold , bro . Fry , if I ever see you try anything that crazy again this crew might just have some new parachute pants . Stop hogging the clover . - Let 's go find that clover . - Which way to your house ? - The sign says we 're at 71 st Street . - 71 st Street ? Never heard of it . - Downtown could be in any direction . - We 'll just take a spin on the B-train . That feels funny ! This is the Brooklyn-bound B-train , stopping wherever I feel like . Watch for the closing doors . Wake up , buddy . End of the line . My old neighborhood . That 's the bench where I found shirts . We used to light that hydrant on fire ! On that corner , some guy handed out a socialist newsletter . - Was it poorly xeroxed ? - Oh , yeah . The comedians were right . This is different from L.A. - Did you say you used to live here ? - That 's right . - Did you know Andy Goldman ? - He was my neighbor . Why ? - I mutated from him . - What 's he up to these days ? I 'm teaching . - He seemed nice . - Sure , when he 's sober . Holy camolie ! The house I grew up in , it 's still there ! Man , Father Time really took a bat to this place . That stupid clover is a worthless piece of garbage . Give it ! Mom , help ! Yes ! - Yancy 's trying to steal my clover . - Yancy , stealing is wrong . I 'm gonna pile drive you . You 're dead meat ! What 's happening ? Did Kremlin Joe let fly with the nukes ? Not yet , commander . Yancy 's trying to steal my stuff . He better keep his hands off these bananas . Gonna need them when the radiation turns us all into monkeys . The Ronco Record Vault . Yancy will never get his hands on you in here . The Breakfast Club soundtrack . I can 't wait until I 'm old enough to feel ways about stuff . Stay safe , clover . I may need you again someday . My dad spent years turning this into a bomb shelter . - Yet there was no nuclear war . - What a waste . This is it . My Ronco Record Vault . I still remember the combination . Three . It 's stuck . The Achilles ' heel of the Ronco design is its structural resonance frequency . There we go . - Here 's The Breakfast Club soundtrack . - You mean breakfast club sandwich ? I hid my clover in the jacket so my brother , Yancy , wouldn 't get it . Here goes . It 's gone ! The whole place has been cleaned out . - Yancy stole my clover . - How do you know it didn 't disintegrate ? - Everything else held up okay . - Except Sports , by Huey Lewis . - My brother hated me so much . - Brothers always fight . He just never got a chance to say he loved you before you got frozen . You think ? Because I always kind of wished that ... - Who is that godlike figure ? - It 's my brother , Yancy . And there 's my seven-leaf clover . I knew he stole it . If that 's Yancy , why does the inscription say Philip J. Fry ? Wait a second . That 's my name . Good Lord ! He ditched his goofy name and stole mine . Apparently , this brave adonis , this Cadillac of men was the " first person on Mars . " - First person on Mars ? ! That should 've been me ! He stole my clover , he stole my name and he stole my life . - And now he broke my hand . - His legend lives on . You opened the vault , and the clover was gone ? Nothing in there but the best music of the 1 980s . Survivor , Pat Benatar , The Scorpions . The list goes on . My brother stole my dream of going into space . - Now I 'll never get there . - You went this morning . " First person on Mars . " So your brother was that Philip J. Fry . - I 'm Philip J. Fry ! He stole my name . - Shut up , friends . My browser heard the word " Fry " and found the Philip J. Fry movie . It also opened my calendar to Friday and ordered some french fries . Philip J. Fry , astronaut , philanthropist , entrepreneur was a great man , truly worthy of narration . Fry was the first man on Mars , a feat never equaled . It should 've been me ! The ever-lucky Fry made his fortune by striking oil in the mansion he had won in a lottery . That 's my clover . He stole it ! After a fling with Icelandic supermodel , Njord Fry scored many hits with his band , Leaf Seven known for their hypnotic rhythms and memorable hooks . I 'm known for that ! Phil came and strummed out this tune . And I said that 's a number-one record . Fry now spends most of his time in his grave at Orbiting Meadows Cemetery buried with his trademark clover to bring him luck in the next life . That 's where my clover is . Is that cemetery near here ? - It will be in a couple of hours . - Good , we 're going grave robbing . I 'll get my kit . Your tux will be perfect for my wedding , Dad . Yancy , that tux got me through Nam in style . - I wish your bother could see this . - I remember the day he disappeared . Wisconsin won the Rose Bowl 1 7-9 . Oh , I miss him . I was gonna rummage through Phil 's records to play at the wedding . He may be missing , but his crap sure isn 't . Breakfast Club . This will clear the room after the reception . He 's buried in the world heroes section ? I 'm impressed . I should be the one in that grave ! We lost Bender . Now no one will be able to say I don 't own John Larroquette 's spine . Aha ! My brother 's grave ! " Philip Fry , the original Martian . " It 's all lies . He wasn 't original . He wasn 't a Martian . - He wasn 't Philip . He wasn 't a " the . " - You 're twice the " the " he ever was . It 's clovering time . - So , had any ideas for names , Yancy ? - I 'm sort of thinking one . Daddy has a present for you . Know what it is ? It 's a lucky clover to help you be successful , even at breakdancing . It belonged to someone very special . I know what name you want to give him . It 's okay . Really ? Son , I 'm naming you Philip J. Fry in honor of my little brother , who I miss every day . I love you , Philip . And I always will . " Here lies Philip J. Fry , named for his uncle to carry on his spirit . " Pay dirt ! I got the clover , plus his wedding ring . Sorry , ladies , I 'm taken . Hey , Fry , you want me to smack the corpse up a little ? Bender , I think Fry needs a moment alone . Okay , grab a shovel . I 'm one skull short of a Mouseketeer reunion .

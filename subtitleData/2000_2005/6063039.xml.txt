 Xhalax Go on ... do it . Believe me ... nothing would give me greater pleasure . But , I kill you ... and another Retrieval Squad will already be on its way . Unless ... I report you terminated , in which case you free me here and now and ... you disappear forever . You forget who is in charge here . I 'll tell you what 's going to happen . You go back to High Command . You tell them I can deliver Talyn and Moya . They can have the escaped prisoners . They can even have Crichton , if they want . And in return ? Two things ... I want Aeryn . Oh , Crais , you 're so predictable . I want Aeryn ! And I want to be a Peacekeeper again ! Is that what you think ? Is that what you think happened , Crichton ? You were there . No , actually , I was busy trying to save Aeryn and Talyn while you were cutting deals to save yourself . You know the truth , you know I 'll never again be a Peacekeeper . Never say never again , 007 . That 's all I know . Still no news of Moya ? Nothing resembling a Leviathan for a million metras . Surely the Peacekeepers will send another Retrieval Squad to come looking for us . Actually , looking for Crais . So , you really should do the noble thing and jump ship before you get us all killed . They 're hunting Talyn as well . I ... I ... I can 't ... You got a problem with your head gear ? Talyn 's signals ... confused . What the gletch is happening ? Happening at full speed , I can feel it . Talyn is fighting with himself . Crais , pull him back . I can 't control him ! Hey , guys , we are flying into a sun ! Knock it off pop-top . Crais , get on the headset and get us out of here . Talyn 's doing everything he can to fight against it . Against what ? The suns emitting unusual pulses of radiation , attracting Talyn ... and compelling him to fly directly into the sun ! So , uncompel him . Stop him ! Knock him out , disconnect him . It 's too late for that ! Shut up , Stark ! Talyn ! Talyn ! Talyn ! What the frell ? Talyn has pulled away . Saved us . And we 're supposed to be grateful ? He 's now orbiting the sun ... his sheilds are holding but ... there are parts of Talyn I can 't see or feel . We 're gonna have to do a manual survey for damage . All right . Crais ... you should stay up here in this section . The rest of us will divide up the ship amongst us . Crais , we 're on Tier Two . I 'd say that 's the damaged area . The Secondary Control Node , and ... it is completely blown . You know , Talyn has got a hog of a power plant , but he 's got a piss-poor electrical system . He sneezes and half of his circuits fry . He hasn 't fully healed from the Retrieval Squad attack . Yeah , I know that ... I still say he could use some heavy-duty wiring . He 's still young . He 's going to get much stronger as he grows . Not if he flies into any more stars he won 't . How big is he gonna get anyway ? Is he gonna be Moya 's size ? Well , Crais seems to think so . Damn ! Here . Be careful . Yeah . Are you there ? Talyn is that you ? Are you there ? Hello Talyn ? You know , for somebody who used to look down their nose at tech work ... you 're pretty damn good at this . Well , perhaps people can change . Well , at least some people are smilin ' around here these days . Yeah I know . It suits your face . I was talkin ' about you . Me ? I 'm not smiling . Yes you are . Pay attention to your work . Right ... focus on the work . And ... don 't do that . I 'm workin ' here ... stop distracting ' me ! I 'm distracting you ? ! Yes . You are always distracting me . Well , then you are easily distracted . No I 'm not . Yes you are . I 'm not . Oh , really ? Okay , that 's a little distracting . And it 's something I did ? Could be . What ? Something like this ? You said ... pay attention to the work . You 're right . I 'm sorry . I won 't ... distract you any further . You ... have problem here ? No , I don 't have a problem . No ? You 're not distracted ? What are we doing ? Better question ... why now ? What ? What the hell is that ? Crais Talyn is leaking ' some kinda ... oh , I see you got it in here too . As far as I can tell ... the mist is exuding from a dozen points on three tiers . You know what it is ? Drexim . A synaptic fluid naturally occuring in Talyn 's conduits . Uh-huh . Why is it steaming from the walls ? When it becomes acidic , it can erode the seals joining the conduits . That is a beautiful design , Crais . Tell me ... is , is this stuff ... affecting you ? No But it seems to have made Rygel permanently hungry . Has it been affecting you , or Aeryn ? Wh ... what exactly does it do to Talyn ? When he 's in danger , it increases the stimulus . Increasing his response rates . All right , so it 's like adrenaline . Adrenaline in humans , when we get in a tight spot , makes us ... fight and , uh ... ... do other things . It 's not gonna affect us the same way is it ? Quite possibly . But the effects should be manageable . Should ... be manageable ? Look , Crais , before uh , we all go crackers ... Hey , baby , how ya doin ' ? ... maybe we should get some space suits , masks or something ? Already thought of that . We 're too late . The Drexim 's reached the suits and it 's made all the seals dissolve . And what are we gonna do if it increases ? We ignore it . And we do what we have to do . Is that clear ? Oh , aye Cap 'n . Yes sir . Can you hear me ? Talyn ? Can you hear me ? Are you there ? I know how you 're feeling , Talyn . I saw you I felt you wanted ... to die . What is this , Talyn ? Please ... Who are you ? ! You can see me ! I am Sierjna . This room ... this room ... I haven 't seen this room before . But you can see me ... and hear me ? Yes , of course I can . You 're there in front of me . I am ? Full formed ? Visible ? ! You can help me ! Wh-What , what do you want ? This room ... this room ... this room ... I seek the Pilot . I 've never seen this room before . I may say the same about this ship . In part , it appears Leviathan , and yet ... not . The ship is Talyn , it is a hybrid . It is part Leviathan , part gunship . Then where is the Pilot ? He should be here . There is no Pilot . There has never been a Pilot . There is always a Pilot . But ... never one who could see , hear , feel me ... until now . How did you get on board this ship ? I ... I Kanished . You were in my zone . In your zone ? I don 't understand . How did you get on board this ship ? Cycles ago , I came from Delfarion . One microt I was on my ship , and then not . I 'm trapped outside my world for so long trying to get back . But I float here unable to free myself . I board a Leviathan , then another , then another . Only to find myself unseen , unheard , by all aboard . Until now , where at last I am given form . Finally I find those who can help me . Please ! Only you can save me ! As I suspected ... Talyn is overproducing Drexim due to the stress he 's under . The radiation pulses are still compelling him to move towards the sun . He is resisting , barely . We 're maintaining orbit and we 're not getting any closer . We 're not getting any further away either . How do we pry this boy loose ? Can we stick cotton in his ears ? Crais is there a way to filter out these pulses ? His shields are linked to his sensors to inform him of ambient conditions . So , cut the link . That would blind him . Get him some sunglasses ... blue blockers . Perhaps we could recalibrate his shields , to block out that one pulse spectrum . Well , we might be able to if the shield overrides were functioning . Where 's the fault ? Secondary control node . Talyn , intruder ! I want to help you They all say that . This unusual vessel ... is it ... a Leviathan ? Who wants to know ? I am Mu-Quillis . You are in great danger . If this is a Leviathan , you must abandon ship immediately . Why ? Your ship has been caught by a siren star . Inevitably it will succumb . Like the 83 Leviathans that have already died here . So , this sun has claimed over 80 Leviathans ? Yes . Please ... get to your lifepods while you still can . I don 't understand how this vessel has lasted this long . Talyn is a hybrid Leviathan , built for combat , with much tougher sheilding . And weapons , I see . Who built it ? How ' bout you tell us first ... how did you get here ? You just beamed in . I transmuted . I 'm something of a hybrid myself . Able to switch between a matter , and an energy state . That 's how I can exist in the star 's corona . So , you live here ? I find the unusual spectrum of the siren star quite ... pleasing . Or maybe you just like watching Leviathans dive in and burn up . Perhaps you cause them to do so . The siren star 's pulse radiation is a perfectly natural phenomenon . It 's not my fault ... that it attracts Leviathans to it . I try to warn them , as I 'm warning you . But until now ... they have always perished ... before I could do so . I don 't believe you . How severely damaged are you ? How closely did you approach before it pulled away ? And I don 't like all these questions . Leave the ship . I 'm only trying to help . Get off the ship , now ! Talyn You 'd be wise to listen to me . Damn , Crais , you 're gettin ' a bit trigger happy . I ordered him to leave . He wouldn 't obey . So , you killed him ? What if he was trying to help ? Cat lives in the corona of a star , Crais . You think you 're going to take him out with a couple of pulse blasts ? He 's gone for the moment , we 've bought some time . Let 's us it . Get back to the conduit . Yes , Dad . We must fly away , quickly , before he discovers I am here . Who ? Mu-Quillis , my savior ... my captor ! A being like yourself ? No , not like me , another species . He inhabited this star before I came . When my Leviathan perished , he kept me from dying . He claims that he saw me and had to save me . He says that he 's in love with me , but I don 't love him and I never will ! He murdered my ship and all it 's passengers ! He did that ? ! He 's still doing it ! That 's why he 's here . To lure Leviathans to their doom ! Why ? He was contracted to ... by the Patriqu-ro , a race of ship builders who see Leviathans are competition . The more Leviathans disappear the more ships they can sell . Yes ! That 's monstrous ! Crais Crais Talyn is being lured into the sun by ... By a creature named Mu-Quillis . I know that , Stark ! What I need to know is how to break free ! I don 't know . I don 't know how he 's doing it ! Sorry , I can 't help you . We must break away ! You don 't know what it 's like . To , to be trapped forever in the light of the sun ! Not to be able to feel , to touch ! Your only companion a monster ! Take me away from him ! I want to walk on a planet again ! I want to breathe its air , I want to drink its cool water ! Give me back my life ! I can 't ... you 've already passed beyond life . Sierjna , you perished with your shipmates . Mu-Quillis trapped your soul between realms . I am ... dead ? Oh , no No , that 's not true , I ... you can see me , you can touch me ! Sierjna ... I am a Stykera with certain talents . I can help you cross over to the next level . To death . No No , I 'm alive . I 'm here . I 'm real again ! You can never be real again in the way you wish . I can only ... release you . I don 't believe it . You , this ship , you brought me back . I 'm whole again , I won 't give that up ! Come with me . God-like aliens . Man , do I hate god-like aliens . I 'll trade a critter for a god-like alien anyday . No , no , we 'll be all right as as long as we stick together . Right , just not too ... close together , ' cause ... Right , yeah . Yes . I , I know ... I ... We 're gonna , we 're gonna ... die ... die , die , die , die , die , die , die , if we don 't get the conduits fixed . Yeah , right ! Focus ! Eyes on the task . Remember the mist . The mist is not your friend . Right . Bad mist . Naughty mist . Oh . That 's ... that 's ... that 's ... better . But even for me , this is a bit excessive . Rygel ? Rygel , can we talk to you ? Stay back , unless you ... I 'm back , I 'm back . Ooh ! What do you want ? I. . We ... just wanted to know ... " We " ? What are you talking about ? Have you gone totally fahrbot ? Who 's " we " ? You see ? It is as I said . I am the only one who can see you . Stark I 'm too sick to witness one of your hallucinations ! That can 't be true , that ... Sir ! Noble sir ... Sierjna , don 't . He can 't hear you . He can 't see you . Mm , yes , but I can see you , you crazy nitmik . Who are you talking to ? Only I can see you . Only I can hear you . Only me . I will take care of you . I promise . Right . That 's done it . He 's gone ... he 's totally insane . No , please ! No , no ... this can 't be true ! I told you . You are Zy-limbron ; not alive . I 've come to take you home . No No . I won 't go with you . Of course you will . You can 't stay here . I can . I have found someone who can help me . You know better than that . This ship is doomed . Like all the others , it will be drawn into the sun , and all on board will perish . You will come back to me . No Not this time . I can free her ! I am Stykera ! I have the energy ! Sierjna ... please ... come with me . No no , I remain here , with Stark . If that is what you wish . The mist , the mist , resist the mist ... resist the mist . Are you done ? I 'm almost done . I 'm really close . Close ? Nearly there . God , I love you . I love you too . Tell me when you 're done . I 'm ... nearly done . Tell me when you 're finishing . I ... Yeah ? Yes ? Almost . Last one . Finished ! Frell Yeah . No , no , no ... I mean , bad frell ! Mr. Sun still wants Talyn . Crais ! What 's with the rumble ? The radiation pulses have intensified and changed ! How the hell could that happen ? I don 't know ! But they have , and their still changing . Shield overrides are working . I 'll try and block out the pulses . Listen ... I know that sound ! He 's luring your ship back to the sun ! No ... You 'll be killed ! All of you ! I 've seen it before , over and over . - Sierjna ! - Every time ! Mu-Quillis was right . He 's all I have . I 'm going to be trapped with him forever ! Listen to me ! I won 't let that happen . I have a plan ! A plan ? Come on . I can 't change Talyn 's course . His compulsion is stronger than ever . The pulse spectrum is shifting too quickly . I can 't block it out . The Pied Piper 's found a new tune . Explain . Natural phenomenon , my ass ! Mu-Quillis is generating these pulses . How ? Uh ... orbiting boom box . He 's , uh ... whistling out his butt . How in the hell should I know ? ! The point is ... we gotta find the source , and we-we gotta squish it . I 'm on scan . A plan , a plan ... save Talyn , a plan ... Talyn , I will lead you away from danger . What are you doing ? This is a Pilot 's station . Maybe I can control Talyn from here , guide him away from the sun . Stark Hey , guys , I think maybe I got somethin ' here . What the frell just happened ? Who pulled the plug ? ! Crais ? Talyn ? My transponder 's dead too , I can 't hear him . Aeryn , overrides . Gone , everything 's out . Talyn , where are you ? ! Nothing 's reponding . Talyn is gone . Stark Stark , can you hear me ? Talyn ... Talyn , I am part of you now . I can sense all of you . I can guide you ! Stark Hurry ! The sun ! Yes , the sun ... . Talyn you will turn away . You must turn away ! Talyn is turning . How ? Everyone ! We 're saved ! We 've done it ! Who has done what ? Talyn and I. We 've escaped from the sun ! And we 've saved Sierjna from Mu-Quillis ! Sierjna Sie ... Sierjna ? ! Oh , no We must have gone too far ! She ... she couldn 't stay with us ! Stark , what in the living hell are you talkin ' about ? ! We must go back ! Must find her ! He 's turning again . Stark ? Are you controlling Talyn ? Yes , yes . I must , I must , I must ... Yo , Astro . Calm down and tell me ... what the hell is goin ' on ? It 's very , very simple . I am now Talyn 's pilot ! And we are flying back into the sun ! What do you mean , you 're Talyn 's pilot ? Talyn doesn 't have a pilot . He does now . I 've bonded with him . Formed a neural link . Joined with him in the den . What den ? Can 't speak now . Searching for Sierjna . Must find Sierjna . Stark Stark , you release control of Talyn at once ! Good ' ol Stark . Count on him to jump right and wig right out . How could he have bonded with Talyn ? Talyn must have developed a rudimentary Pilot 's Den . Crais , I thought you bred out the need for a Pilot in Talyn . We tried to , but Leviathan biology is complex . Enough linked genes must have remained for Talyn to grow a vestigial Pilot facility . Like ... an appendix ? Wait ... where is this Den ? Mostly likely somewhere below Tier Three . If I can 't restore the overrides , I 'll go find it myself . Fine , you do that , get his hands off the wheel . We 're gonna do somethin ' else . Sierjna ... Which one is guidance ? That one . Hey , Stark , didja feel that ? No , no ... I , I can 't , can 't maneuver ! That 's right . You might want to hit the brakes . We just took out your steering . Talyn ! You listen to me ! I know you can hear me ! You 're taking the wrong option ! You will kill us , and you will kill yourself ! Come on , Stark , talk to me . We can work this out . Yo , Astro ... talk to me . We can work it out ... Lava boy is not your friend ... I am . You okay ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm , I 'm all right . Thanks for watchin ' my backside . Couldn 't help myself . Stark ... you listen to me now . You try anything like that again , and I will personally take you to the other side ! Talyn I am trying to help you ! All the lower decks are sealed off . I can 't get into the Den to free you from the Banik Slave ! That 's it , Talyn . Bypass the primary guidance system . That 's it , careful ! We don 't want them finding out what we 're doing . Talyn , you listen to me ! I am trying to save you ! Talyn Hey , Stark ... talk to me . You gettin ' lonely up there ? You like bein ' alone ? Don 't think he 's listening . No But it 's not good to be alone . No , it 's not . Maybe we should go find him . And leave these conduits unattended ? He 'll up send another DRD to repair it all . Yeah , and lead us like a moth to the flame . Let Stark make the first move . You know what he 's like . He doesn 't have much patience . Right . We have , uh ... all the time in the world ; no need to rush . You comfortable ? Aeryn , this is the mist talkin ' . I like what it 's saying . So do I , but we gotta ... we gotta focus . I 'm doing my job , corridor is all clear . So it 's just you and me ? Just you and me . Slower ... slower . Turn ... that 's it . Mustn 't let you get too close . Just close enough . Stark Stark Sierjna But you got away , you were free ! I came back for you ! No no , you 're risking everything ! Nothing else matters ! I told you I would save you , and I will . Even if it takes my own life ! Stark ... I will take you ... I will walk you to the other side . Do you trust me ? Mu-Quillis will kill you . Do you trust me ? ! Yes . Are you ready ? I 'm frightened . Don 't be frightened . No need . Come closer . I 'm ready . Thank you . I will find you in the next life . You 're still here . I have neither moved ... nor changed . It 's not working ... why is it not working ? Are you still eating ? Oh , stop me , Crais . Make me stop ! Shoot me ! Do something , please ! Here , here , tie my hands ! Yes ! I need your help . No , no , no , no , no Tie my hands , now ... or I 'm going to explode . Oh , this is all your fault ! This is your gunship . Peacekeepers designed it and you can 't control it ! I can control you now ! You press that into me and I 'm going to vomit all over you ! Stark is a mutineer . He 's also out of his frelling mind . Came in here and had a conversation with that wall . Must be the mist making him see things . Rygel Stark has taken control of Talyn . He must be flushed out so I can take back command . Well , go ahead . I need your help , slug ! Please , let me eat that little piece , please ! Now you listen to me . Talyn has sealed all the entrances to his den . But maybe you , being so small ... can slip through a ventilation duct . Look at me , look at my stomachs ! I 'm not slipping through any ducts ! I am your Captain ! You 're not my captain ! This is a direct order ! Dream on ! If you don 't obey my orders ... Yes , this mist isn 't affecting you , huh ? ! If you do not obey my orders , right now , and go into the pilot 's den and flush out the Banik , I will shoot you as a mutineer ! As you wish . Crais ... come here . Why ? Closer ... this is a secret . If you try anything ... Closer ... Rygel I don 't understand it . You , it , it should have worked ! Let her go . If we try again . Nothing will happen . Why do you think she never crossed over in the first place ? What do you think is keeping her between the realms ? Me , my power . You had your chance to escape . You might have saved your ship , your crew , your own life , but you returned ! You have me back , Mu-Quillis . You can let them go ! No It is not for me to make that decision . My task is set . This ship will continue to the sun . Sierjna ... come with me . No , no Sierjna ... Don 't do it ! Oh , you must Wait , Sierjna ! Don 't go ! Oh , no , no ... Talyn , please ! Fight it , fight it ! Turn away ! Turn away please , Talyn ! No , Talyn , please ! Turn away ! Stark Everyone ... I 'm sorry . Talyn is once more being drawn into the sun . The lure is stronger than ever , and Talyn can 't fight it and I can 't stop him . So , I suggest you prepare yourselves for peace . Because I have failed you . And we 're all going to die . All we can do now is wait . I 'm not letting you go . I 'm never letting you go . Wait a microt . What ? This is wrong . God , the mist ... the damn mist is messing with our heads . That 's why we 're giving up . I 'm not giving up ! I never give up . Okay I 'm gonna go to the bridge , I 'm gonna tear it apart , I 'm gonna find something . Okay ... the same with Crais and Stark . You tear ' em apart , Baby . All right , listen ... I don 't want to lose you either , can we definately get back to that later ? Oh , God , I love you . I love you too . Crais what are you ... ? I can 't get in ! Talyn will not comply with my orders ! And the Drexim ... has obviously driven him insane ! Blast your way in . Yes ! Give me your gun ! Perhaps ... not . Do not question my decisions ! I am your captain ! And I order you ... ! I am your captain ! I order you ! All right , Phantom . New tune for the opera . Sierjna 's gone . I failed her ... failed Talyn , failed Aeryn , failed you , Crichton . Yes , and you have failed gloriously , Stark ! And I want you ... to fail again ! I want you to give me control of the consoles ! I want you to give me some control ! She came to me for help . Many do , but ... I could have done more . Stark I ... am coming to you for help . You are gonna give me control , or I am gonna rip off the other side of your damn face ! There 's nothing you can do , Crichton . We are gonna be lured into that sun and we are all going to die inside there . That 's because the bastard ... is luring ' us in , Stark ! Okay ? ! He 's got bait , and we can cut bait . We got a mother of a cannon ! So , I want you to give me back control ... ! I was zero 'n in on the damn power source when you turned out the lights ! You remember when we met ? You wanna take a trip down memory lane ? ! Stark ... My side ! Your side ! My side ! Your side ! My side ! Your side ! I tried to help you then , but I failed . Scorpius put a chip in your brain , I failed . Stark Blow the damn Aurora chair ! Let 's talk about the good times , huh ? ! Do you remember Zhaan , Stark ? Let 's talk about Zhaan . I tried to help her , but I couldn 't . Well , she would piss on your grave right now . You wanna know why ? ! My soulmate . Because , Aeryn ... is my Zhaan . She 's my Zhaan in every way . I love her , and I would die for her and you know what ... Stark ? ! You 're killing her ! What ... me ? You 're killing her , you freakazoid psycho bastard ! You are killing my Zhaan ! Hi . I ... got some control back let me show you . I love it when you take control . That 's the Drexim talking . No , it isn 't . I can manually prime the cannon . I 'd love to see that . Talyn 's cannon . I 'm stoked , not stupid . Do it . We 've only got one chance with it , John . We 're too close to the star , we 've got one chance . Whoa , whoa , whoa , hey , check this out ! A throbbing pulse of energy coming straight into your living room . I got it ! Stark , are you still there ? You 're just like Zhaan in so many ways . If you say so . I am going to manually prime the main cannon . Crichton has located a target . Please prepare Talyn to fire . Would Zhaan approve of this use of violence ? She 's speaking through me now . It is her wish . No You 're risking everything . You 're back ! You 're too close , don 't do this for me ! I 'm not . Mu-Quillis has Talyn mezmerized . Stop what you 're doing ! Is there some kind of stupid alien quotation book you guys use ? A deal between us can be brokered . Lava boy , you are losing ! A compromise assures your survival . Again with the quote book . Hey , quote me on this ... We 're gonna blow up your fuse box . I will release my grip on your vessel . And in return ? Go away . Wow , he 's gonna give us our freedom in exchange for his . Leave us to our own . What about other Leviathan 's you 'll encounter ? Why should that concern you ? That was the wrong answer . Sorry . Stark Talyn ... it is time ! Power down your weapons ! I can offer you better terms . Damn , smokey , you can 't argue with a woman . Sierjna Now ... This apparatus was not designed for any species but a Pilot 's . What you did was beyond foolish , Stark . Hold still . You cut me ! You moved . Talyn is now off limits to you . All functions , all programs , all controls . I know . You know nothing . I know how he feels , what he thinks . About everything ... about you . Talyn was not of his right mind . Anything you think you experienced must take that into consideration . I know . Even if you slit my throat ... I will still know . Most of Talyn 's internal systems are back on line , and his Drexim levels have returned to normal . I wish my levels were returning to normal . Next commerce planet , you are restocking the galley . You ate everything . I never ever want to even look at food again . Must go to chamber . Need sleep . Vomit . Outside my way How 's it goin ' ? He 's recovering well . He 's a remarkable vessel . Speaking of ... remarkable vessels . How is the secondary control node ? I got a chain gang of DRDs workin ' on it . Everything will be up and runnin ' in a couple of days . We were very lucky . Well , I think that , uh fate ... would have brought us together anyway . You know ... Crais is gonna be cuttin ' Stark free for about an arn ... Rygel 's gonna take at least that long ... He 's got three stomachs .

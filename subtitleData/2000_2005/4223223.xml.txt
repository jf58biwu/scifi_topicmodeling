 BOWMAN : By the year 2000 , we had begun to overpopulate , pollute and poison our planet faster than we could clean it up . We ignored the problem for as long as we could but we were kidding ourselves . By 2025 , we knew we were in trouble and began to desperately search for a new home : Mars . For the last 20 years , we 've sent unmanned probes with algae bio-engineered to grow there and produce oxygen . We 'll build ourselves an atmosphere we can breathe . And for 20 years it seemed to work . It looked like we 'd pulled it off , we 'd done it . Then all of a sudden , oxygen levels started to drop . We don 't know why . The international community has thrown all its resources behind us . It 's the greatest undertaking man has ever attempted . Our ship , Mars-1 , is too massive to launch from the surface of the planet . We 've shuttled to the high-orbit space station for a low-gravity launch to begin our six-month trip : The first manned mission to Mars . The hope and survival of mankind rests on us . But I know we 'll solve the problem . Because the best scientific minds are going there to figure out the answer . And I 'm leading the mission . I 'm Bowman , pilot and mission commander . Chantilas , chief science officer and the soul of the crew . Santen , a hothead , but a fine copilot . Gallagher , our mechanical systems engineer . Maintenance . Frankly , not my first choice . The two civilian members of the team are : Burchenal , one of the world 's leading bio-engineers , his own greatest hero . Pettengil terraforming expert and last-minute replacement on the science team . And packed away in her box , AMEE : Autonomous Mapping Exploration and Evasion . A multi-task robot on loan from the Marines . In other words , our Mars surface navigator . We 're the first travelers to another planet . It 's another giant leap for mankind and if we don 't figure out what 's wrong on Mars , it could be our last . SANTEN : Alpha Mach Indicator . - Clear . LUCILLE : Confirmed . That concludes the primary systems checklist , commander . BOWMAN : Thanks , Lucille . LUCILLE : You 're welcome . Gentlemen take over . - Can 't believe we 're doing this . BOWMAN : Just follow the routine . Secondary systems . OHS / RCS . PETTENGIL : Clear . LUCILLE : RCS , confirmed . - Optical alignment sight . LUCILLE : Op sight , rate 19 . PETTENGIL : Clear . LUCILLE : Confirmed . How many hits you get on your website yesterday , Pettengil ? - I got 500,000 . - That 's great . How many did you get ? LUCILLE : ATU , 13.6 degrees . - Eight hundred and thirty-two . - Ha , ha , ha . - Were they all from your mother ? - Yeah . PETTENGIL : You know , it 's strange . It 's gone . Yesterday I could see it . Today I looked and I couldn 't find it . So what ? You think the Earth just vanished ? It 's gone forever ? - It 's weird not being able to see it . - Yeah , so it 's weird . You 'll get over it , or you won 't . Just something I wasn 't expecting , that 's all . Gallagher , up for a couple of turns around the campus ? GALLAGHER : My grandfather taught me to sail when I was a kid . Taught me to read the stars . " Just in case all the GPS satellites fell out of the sky , " he said . He said , " Any man who puts his life in the hands of a bunch of batteries is an idiot . " A real Yankee . No , he just wouldn 't approve something he couldn 't build with his hands . - He wouldn 't have approved of this . - Going to Mars ? GALLAGHER : He 'd say we were headed for trouble . CHANTILAS : Say we didn 't try . We just finished poisoning the Earth and everyone was dead in 100 years . Then what was the point of any of it ? Art , beauty , all gone . The Greeks . The Constitution . We 've been dying for freedom , ideas . None of it meant anything ? And what about religion ? Do we give up on God too ? You didn 't just give up being a scientist one day , did you ? I realized science couldn 't answer any of the really interesting questions . So I turned to philosophy . Been searching for God ever since . Hey . You 're talking to a classroom of second graders from Iowa . At 14 : 30 . Wait a minute . It 's your turn to do the kiddies . Oh , no . It is your turn , and you know it . Besides I outrank you . I could order you to do it . Just because they promote faster in the Navy . Of course they do . You have to when you deal with the best people . 14 : 30 , with a smile on your face . This mean you 're pulling rank for the shower too ? No , not rank . Gender . Ladies first . Could you pass me the towel , please ? Sure . Sorry . Just pretend I 'm your sister . I have two sisters . They don 't look like you . This only works if we both believe it doesn 't matter . - So I should pretend you 're Burchenal . - It could matter more than that . Why don 't we practice ? You can get back in the shower naked and come out , and I 'll pretend it doesn 't matter . Why don 't you go fix something ? Yes , sir . Ma 'am . LUCILLE : MEV systems check confirmed . - I 'll be on the deck with Bowman . - Yep , sure . - Five hundred thousand . - Eight thirty-two . Tighten up . Hee-ta ! - Ha , ha , ha . SANTEN : Get ready , boys . GALLAGHER : Yeah . I hate him . It 's like high school . There 's the jocks and then us . You watch my back , I 'll watch yours . Do you want to help me with AMEE ? It 's time for her prelaunch diagnostics check . Hang on . Who are you kidding ? You 're a jock . You did the NASCAR circuit , right ? I was just tuning cars . Wasn 't really jock stuff . - It 's heavy . - Ears are still ringing . PETTENGIL : What powers this thing ? GALLAGHER : A helium nuclear power cell . Size of a beer can , runs her for eight months . [ BLEEPING ] GALLAGHER : Hey , sweetie . Sweetie ? Is she our navigator or your girlfriend ? - Been a long flight . - Certainly has . It 's looking good . Let 's check your TI . Tighten up ! So the military removed her reflexes ? That should make her your kind of girl . Gut him like a fish . [ BLEEPING ] Kill him . That 's my kind of girl . That 's real damn funny . LUCILLE : Activity strictly prohibited . Cease . - She could 've hurt me . They took away her knife , but inside she 's all Green Beret . Back in navigator mode . You 'll dig Mars . WEBSITE FAN 1 [ ON TV ] : So have a good time and I hope to see you back on Earth soon . Good luck . We miss you . Bye . OPERATOR : 209 web messages remaining . WEBSITE FAN 2 : Hey , Teddy . Remember me ? Sure hope you haven 't forgotten your old friends now that you 're a big hotshot astronaut . Just wanted to let you know I 'm thinking about you . [ TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS ] LUCILLE : I sense an irregular humidity mixture . - Hi . - Hi . How you doing ? Fine . Soon as someone explains to me why a flight deck indicator says the temperature is above normal . About 10 degrees . Fahrenheit or centigrade ? He 's teaching me about biology . - I 've developed an interest in ... - Fermentation ? A billion dollars in this mission , and you use the lab equipment as a still ? GALLAGHER : No . I 'm ... - I 'm sterilizing . - Uh-huh . And how do you propose that I explain to Houston that two of my crew went blind drinking moonshine vodka ? Very carefully ? [ BURCHENAL LAUGHING ] So , what ? Doesn 't this establishment serve women ? Allow me . Commander Bowman . Whoo ! I learned how to drink in the Navy , boys . BURCHENAL : Chantilas , there were frogs around when you were a kid , right ? CHANTILAS : Lots . BURCHENAL : And then we killed them . Every last one . Now , since frogs breathe through their skins they react to the toxins in the environment more rapidly . That should 've been a warning . Don 't you think ? What 's your point ? Man 's a party animal . If he 's doing okay , then nothing else matters . That 's not gonna change . Unless there are larger forces at work than biology . Uh-oh . We 're gonna talk about God now , aren 't we ? If we are , I 'll need another pop . Not God , faith . Faith ? I had a girlfriend named Faith . Cheated on me with a girl named Chastity . [ ALL CHUCKLE ] You wouldn 't be riding 309 million kilometers into outer space and back in a rocket ship that nobody ever tested properly without having a little faith . [ CHUCKLES ] Listen . Let 's forget all the hypotheticals for a second , okay ? I say to hell with humanity . I say , Commander Bowman when we get to Mars , we just take it . We just take it over for ourselves . Call Earth , tell them it sucks and don 't bother coming ? Yeah . Whatever keeps out the riffraff . You can do the religion thing . Gallagher , you can keep the space john working , and Pettengil 's passed out and I can handle pretty much everything else , you know . King . What about me ? Well , you 'll be my queen . Propagation of the species . It 's just a ... It 's just a joke . Commander Bowman , it was a ... [ PETTENGIL CHUCKLES ] And on that note , gentlemen , I suggest we retire . CONTROLLER [ ON RADIO ] : Mars-1 , Houston . You have acquired orbit . Congratulations on 182 days of smooth sailing . And welcome to Mars . Houston out . [ TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS ] Find a good parking space ? Yep . Right between Phobos and Deimos . GALLAGHER : I prefer one moon , you know ? That way , you know what to call it . " The moon . " More color commentary from the janitor . The correct term is " mechanical systems engineer . " - But he will accept " space janitor . " BURCHENAL : To hell with the chitchat . After six months , I 'm ready to get out of this hamster cage . Bowman ? Lucille , initiate all pre-launch systems checks . LUCILLE : Yes , commander - Finally . We 're eating dinner on Mars . Sounds good to me . LUCILLE : Mars entry vehicle launch in two hours . HAB 3-D model online . BOWMAN : It 'll be nice to live on the ground . SANTEN : Even if we are exchanging one hamster cage for another . BOWMAN : If all 's gone well , hydroponics have been online for six months . We 'll have fresh tomatoes tonight . That 's one requirement for my dream house . Bet you want a white picket fence , right ? BOWMAN : I wouldn 't mind . - Lucille , can we see our new home ? - Yes , commander . Locking in on HAB . LZ 56 . SANTEN : Sure is desolate . [ CRACKLING ] SANTEN : Gamma burst . BOWMAN : Latch up . Free flow . We 'll lose chips . Shut it down ! Now ! SEP , some kind of massive solar flare . LUCILLE : Radiation alert . Level 5 EMP . [ ALARM SOUNDS ] Whoa . Radiation alert . Safe area . Go , guys ! Go ! - You too , lieutenant . - I 'm not going anywhere . - You need me here . - I want you back there now ! Lieutenant , now . Go . LUCILLE : Massive gamma ray penetration . The solar flare has passed , commander . Power levels are below operating minimums . Shit ! BOWMAN : Santen ? - Yeah , Bowman , we copy . We 're all okay . What 's the damage to the ship ? - We 're dead in the water . LUCILLE : Main power unit offline . She 's holding it together now but could fall apart at any moment . Auxiliary power unit failure . Power level still dropping . Primary systems will shut down in six minutes . Change of plans , boys . We 're launching now . Suit up . BOWMAN : I 'll secure the ship . I 'm gonna try to get more systems online and then I 'll join you . COMPUTER : Chantilas , suit voice activated . Gallagher , suit voice activated . LUCILLE : Power level still dropping . Primary systems will shut down in five minutes . COMPUTER : Suit computer , online . Dr. Burchenal , your EVA systems are 100 percent . LUCILLE : MEV LP lock . Commence MEV systems check . AGF online . Apogee kick motor online . Anti-inertial thrusters initialized . BOWMAN : Auto-launch program online . I 'm arming it now . LUCILLE : Clock de-lock 9K open . IMU online . DCM flat . AVVI engaged . - Launch release system not responding . - That 's not good . - No , it isn 't . - Let 's try it another way . LRS not responding . - Failure to engage . - Come on . Launch release system not responding . COMPUTER : Lieutenant Santen , suit seal 100 percent . Air supply 100 percent . LUCILLE : Ignition systems go . MEV landing system check . I 'm sorry . Launch release system not responding . Okay , guys . Listen up . The MEV 's not supplying power to the launch release system . I 'm gonna have to stay back and arm it manually . Commander , with all due respect , we 're not leaving without you . BOWMAN : It 's not up for debate . Cut auto-guidance and try to reboot the arm . No , we don 't have time . Santen you 're in charge . I hope you like the saddle . Lock it up , gentlemen . LUCILLE : Santen , MEV launch systems ready . Launch on your command . - Crew secure ? - Secure . - Secure . - Secure . Secure . LUCILLE : The MEV guidance system is scanning for the HAB transponder . MEV launch sequence initiated . We 're green across the board . Boosters online . Fueling D tanks . God , I hope she makes it . LUCILLE : Commander , primary system shutdown in 50 seconds . Launch . [ BEEPING ] Auto-guidance out . Flare must 've cooked a chip . I thought MEV was shielded . LUCILLE : Complain later . I 'm going to manual flight . LUCILLE : Commander , five seconds . Primary system shutdown . Artificial gravity failure . Oh , shit . We have an electrical fire in access tube four . Smoke warning in sphere six . [ GRUNTING ] LUCILLE : The solar radiation damaged the auto fire extinguishers . - Caution , commander . - Later , Lucille . [ BOWMAN GRUNTS ] This is a zero-gravity fire , commander . I tried warning you . SANTEN : Deploying chutes . Smoke warning in sphere six . Brace yourself this time . Commander , we have additional fires in spheres three and five . [ BEEPING ] We 're off-target . Terrain 's crappy . - I 'm dumping the landing gear . GALLAGHER : AMEE 's in there . SANTEN : No choice . [ BOTH GRUNTING ] LUCILLE : We now have fire in spheres three , seven and eight . I 'm deploying bags . [ BOWMAN COUGHS ] LUCILLE : Bio-systems indicate increasing air toxicity . [ SINGING ] Here comes your 19th Nervous breakdown [ GRUNTING ] SANTEN : Chantilas ! LUCILLE : Flames now consume 80 percent of the ship . This exceeds our fire-extinguishing capacity . [ GRUNTS ] All fires are extinguished . O-2 levels 0 percent . SANTEN : Okay , okay . GALLAGHER : Take him easy . Here . Good . Help him up . SANTEN : Here , sit down for a minute . GALLAGHER : Nice and easy . SANTEN : There you go . [ ALL PANTING ] COMPUTER : Init , terra , Mars , alpha . Compiling mission itinerary . SANTEN : You don 't appear to have any compound fractures . Doesn 't look like you broke anything . LUCILLE : Reserve power supplies are failing . Auxiliary power unit , 20 percent . BOWMAN : Reroute the main power supply through the B-chip , Lucille . This violates operating parameters , commander . I 'm not gonna take no for an answer . You got that ? Do it . Now . Yes , commander . Alpha processor discharged . Power sent to beta chip . Main power unit 15 percent . Main power unit restored . Well done , commander . - Artificial gravity restored . - No shit . Artificial atmosphere systems restored . O-2 level 2 percent and increasing . SANTEN : Where the hell is HAB ? GALLAGHER : If you hadn 't dumped our navigator , we 'd know . Can 't get a visual on AMEE , but maybe I can fix this radio . SANTEN : How long ? I don 't know . These repairs 'll take a while . BURCHENAL : Science package is KO 'd also . - Shit . There goes the mission . - Mission 's not over yet , Pettengil . Really ? Did you miss something ? We lost the science package . - We can 't do what we came here for . - Quit whining . You did park us on the rocks . And you knew there were risks . Right now , gentlemen , locating HAB is what matters . COMPUTER : Exterior atmosphere indicator is disabled . - I think we 're somewhere downrange . - Calculating landing ellipse . Based on our last uncorrupted nav state I 'd say we 're somewhere in this 60 by 120 kilometer ellipse . The mission data 's here . We need to close in on the downrange variables . It 's about the math . This is it . That moment they told us about in high school where one day , algebra would save our lives . Shut up . Sorry . COMPUTER : Warning , AMEE not responding . Mars-1 comm initiation unsuccessful . T-ray imaging . Oh , man . System memory , bring up a panoramic shot from the HAB . COMPUTER : Ocular mach 1-X panoramic mode . - Reverse ? - Downrange charging . Hey , guys . Look at this . SANTEN : What , Gallagher ? I don 't think it 's about the math . I think it 's about the picture . SANTEN : What picture ? GALLAGHER : This one . We 're not in that picture . If we were , we 'd know where HAB was . I know , but if this rock is HAB and it 's in the line about 30 degrees it sees these two peaks , but reverse , as it 's on the other side and at 180 degrees , it sees those two peaks . Which puts us on a line about here which makes the line to the HAB about there . He 's right . Nice work , space janitor . We only have seven and a half hours of air left . Let 's get moving . CHANTILAS : I realized science couldn 't answer any of the really interesting questions . So I turned to philosophy . Been searching for God ever since . Who knows ? I may pick up a rock and it 'll say underneath , " Made by God . " Universe is full of surprises . That would be a big one . You ready , sir ? Unfortunately , I 'm staying here . What ? My spleen 's ruptured . There 's significant internal bleeding . I wouldn 't get very far . We have emergency medical gear at HAB . We can lock out the spine impulse . You can walk us through the surgery . Carrying me will slow you all down , enough to deplete everyone 's oxygen . This is no time for misguided heroics . I won 't let you die here . CHANTILAS : What we came here to do is more important . The four of you must carry on with the mission . It won 't be easy , but I know you can do it . Get going . You heard the man . Hey I got to see Mars . Come on , give me a red light . Give me juice . Come on , don 't do this to me and my team . Give me a goddamn red light . LUCILLE : Communications online . See ? All you needed was an attitude check . Thank you , commander . Mars ground crew , this is Mars-1 . Can you hear me ? Over . Mars ground crew , this is Mars-1 . Do you copy ? Over . COMPUTER : Terrascan has nothing to report . No life form trace apparent . It 's weird . There 's nothing here . It 's Mars . No , I mean there 's not one sign of the algae we sent up here . Even if it all died , there should be something . Dried algal mat , traces ... BURCHENAL : He 's right . They 're not just dead , they 're gone . Like they were scoured off . This says there was nothing ever here . Impossible . Maybe there was never anything in this valley . If we are where we think we are this area was covered with blue algae just a month ago . The valley before this should 've been blazing with red-orange chloroflectic . All this talking 's burning up oxygen . Move out . We know what happened to the oxygen . Nothing here to make it . You done ? I said , move out . [ BLEEPING ] LUCILLE : Ten minutes until we exit the day side . Okay , where are the boys ? Grid tracking . De-lock . - Boys , where are you ? - LZ topography . Six degrees tracking , three minutes tracking . LT lock . MEV landing zone . LZ 56 . Why aren 't you at the LZ ? Five minutes until we exit the day side and lose visuals . 1-4-4-X . Azimuth HZ 4.99 . Boys , where are you ? MEV LP lock . Oh , shit . Find HAB for me , Lucille . SANTEN : There it is ! - We made it . - Twenty-six months of food , air and water . BURCHENAL : We made it ! - Food ! Whoo ! [ ALL CHEERING AND LAUGHING ] SANTEN : God help us . BURCHENAL : It 's all chewed up . What happened ? - Ice storm couldn 't have done this . - No way . Every HAB stood up to an F-5 in tornado alley . GALLAGHER : This isn 't weather-related . Okay . What are we gonna do ? Start looking for O-2 . Houston , this is Mars-1 . We 've experienced a massive proton field upset sequel to a solar flare . Mars-1 systems at below 70 percent , orbital path degraded by fire-control air purge . Engine function zero . MEV launched with a crew of five . I have visual on crash site . I can see one person down . I have absolutely no radio contact with them . Houston , visuals confirm that HAB-1 is tango-uniform . I repeat , HAB-1 has been destroyed . Even if the rest of the team is alive , they have no way to survive . I 'm uploading telemetry and video data to you now . LUCILLE : Data unit relay . I don 't see anything . No food , no air , no water . PETTENGIL : What are we gonna do ? BURCHENAL : Nothing we can do . We 're out of time . SANTEN : We 're out of time when we 're out of air . Sixteen minutes . What do you got left ? A little less . Some final entry for the bio . " Disappointed 12 billion people , not counting the ex-wives . " Ugh ! I hope Bowman made it . You know , I had a thing for her from the start . I thought they chose me because I was single in case I died . Short time to live . Long time to wait . God , it really is beautiful , isn 't it ? I was planning on getting engaged when I got back . Yeah , well , I 'm gonna miss a lot of girls . A lot of girls are gonna miss me . [ CHUCKLES ] I was never supposed to be here . I was just the next lucky guy on the list . Well , my flying ability isn 't an issue now . With HAB destroyed , it makes no difference where we landed . You 're calculating excuses . Nothing to excuse . It 's moot . No impact . - But Chantilas ? - Moot . He 'd have died here anyway . Just like us . You 're amazing , Mr. Santen . Your life is about to end , and you still can 't accept defeat . I can come across as a hard-ass . I know that . But technically I didn 't fail . Look , what 's done is done . - I came up here to forgive you . - Yeah ? Well , screw you . I don 't need forgiveness from a pussy like you . Get out of here . Go away and die like a man if you can . Santen . Oh , my God . Santen ! Oh , Jesus . BURCHENAL : Mars ' polar ice is mostly CO-2 . We use low-order nuclear detonations to melt the ice . That releases CO-2 . CO-2 buildup creates a greenhouse effect . Mars starts to warm up . Now , when it 's hot enough we seed down some algae . The algae grows and emits oxygen . You want me to just shut up and let you die quietly ? No . Kind of peaceful . Okay . So they sent us here to figure out what happened to the oxygen . Question is what happened to the algae ? You know ? PETTENGIL : Santen 's dead . He threw himself off a cliff . I tried to stop him . COMPUTER : Gallagher , replace your O-2 canister immediately . I 'm under a minute . What 's it gonna be like ? Hypoxia ? Dizziness . Skin will tingle . Vision narrows . Then shock , convulsions acidosis ... Is it gonna hurt ? Yeah . I 'm going to ... I 'm going to go over here . Take a walk . [ SUIT BEEPING ] COMPUTER : Gallagher , oxygen supply depleted . [ GRUNTING ] PETTENGIL : Gallagher . - I was ... Ugh ! Ugh ! [ GRUNTS ] [ GASPING ] [ GRUNTING ] [ GROANING ] [ GASPING AND GRUNTING ] Burchenal , replace your O-2 canister immediately . [ GASPING AND GRUNTING ] [ GASPING ] [ GRUNTING ] [ GASPING ] [ GRUNTING ] COMPUTER : Pettengil , replace your O-2 canister immediately . [ GASPING ] [ WIND WHISTLING ] I can breathe . I can breathe . It 's like being in high altitude . I don 't know how we can breathe , but we can breathe . [ BREATHING DEEPLY ] BURCHENAL : We can breathe ! I don 't know what the hell this is . But I 'll take it . [ BURCHENAL LAUGHING ] GALLAGHER : I can breathe . This can 't be possible . What the hell is going on here ? If Santen waited a few more minutes ... We can breathe , Santen . We can breathe . LUCILLE : Attention , commander , incoming relay . CONTROLLER : Mars-1 , this is Houston . We got your message . Glad to hear your voice . Analysis of your telemetry indicates Mars-1 orbital failure in 31 hours . The good news is , we 'll have you out of there by then . We believe we can restore engine function for a main engine burn and exit from Mars ' orbit . Ground crew is presumed end of mission . Houston out . Terraforming didn 't even come close to creating breathable air up here . - Right ? - Right . The oxygen levels were already dropping when all the sensors died . So how can there be more O-2 now than ever before and no algae to make it ? Huh ? LUCILLE : Sorry , commander . No response from ignition systems . Houston , Mars-1 . No joy on all scenarios for engine ignition . That includes hitting the console . What next ? Over . God , I wish I didn 't have to wait 40 minutes to hear your answer . Hey , guys . Here 's the radio . We 're not going to be calling Bowman on this . Wait a second . I saw something when we were trying to locate HAB . That little rover they sent up here back in ' 97 . That must have a radio , right ? - Yeah . - Hang on . It 's 4 kilometers from here . Gonna get dark real soon . It 'll be too cold . We 'll go first light . BURCHENAL : At least this thing still has enough rocket fuel to keep us warm . Here comes a billion-dollar campfire . At least it 's good for something . Ha . [ GROWLING ] If the radio at the rover works we can contact Bowman tell her there 's breathable air here . But that isn 't gonna help us , is it ? Hey , Pettengil . Must have been hard watching Santen go like that , huh ? Yes , it was . I bet . [ AMEE WHIRRING ] PETTENGIL : It 's your girlfriend . She made it . BURCHENAL : Hey , AMEE . I thought you were dead . GALLAGHER : Hi , sweetie . Good to see you . You 're kind of banged up . Knew you 'd make it . Hey , are you a little out of whack ? Flip over for me . Shoot . The processor 's damaged . - Can she still navigate for us ? - Yeah , till she breaks down for good . We wait till she breaks down , the drone 'll crash . Let 's yank her Mars positioning system now . GALLAGHER : MPS hard drive 's modular . It 's self-powered . We can run it through an HHC . That would give us control of the drone but then , that 'd be killing her . Yeah ? You want me to do it ? No , I 'll do it . GALLAGHER : AMEE ! AMEE . Shit . Ah ! AMEE , no . No . Ah ! [ BURCHENAL SCREAMING ] AMEE . PETTENGIL : Gallagher , what 's going on ? GALLAGHER : She 's in military mode . Crash must 've flipped her . PETTENGIL : Why did she turn on us ? - We tried to kill her . - Made us the enemy . BURCHENAL : Son of a bitch . - You okay ? PETTENGIL : Then override her . I tried . She won 't respond . PETTENGIL : It 's a broken rib . Tell me something I don 't know , like why she let us live . She had us . She 's playing war games . Guerilla tactics . It 's an old trick . Wound one of the enemy . The others have to help out . Slows them down . Sooner or later , she 'll play search and destroy . Then she 'll come and kill us . One by one . You all right ? [ COMPUTER SQUEALS ] AMEE jammed the transmitters so we won 't know where she is . You all right ? Only hurts when I breathe . Sun 's gonna come up soon . Might as well get going . Give me a hand ? Whoa . [ CHUCKLES ] Sure get some high arc in this low gravity , huh ? [ YAWNS ] GALLAGHER : Watching this , AMEE ? Taking the first piss on Mars . LUCILLE : Boosters online . AMI confirmed . Ignition system operable . Awaiting burn instructions . Houston , I have a green light for engine ignition . I repeat , I 'm a go for engine ignition . Thank you , guys . Thank you for busting your asses . I have some time before I have to punch . I 'll take another look for the crew at daybreak . I know they 're end of mission , but it 's something I gotta do . Over . Relayed . PETTENGIL : You know what you 're doing , right ? I always know what I 'm doing . Charming . It 's a 50-year-old off-the-shelf computer modem on a frequency we 're not using I I on our mission but it beats shouting for help . I got it . LUCILLE : Synchronous lock . L-2.3. Seek lock off . 1-4-4-X . HZ lock . Houston , Mars-1 . I 'm configuring Mars-1 for a final slingshot around the day side . And I will be returning to Earth . Relayed . Let 's do it . Test , test . Does it work ? I don 't know . The little green light 's on . Houston , Mars-1 . I 've acquired elliptical orbit . I 'm commencing engine ignition sequence for Earth return . This is Mars-1 ground crew . Do you copy ? This is Mars-1 ground crew . Do you copy ? This is Mars-1 ground crew . Do you copy ? Hello ? We 're the guys on Mars . Come on . Someone talk to us . Let 's try it again . GALLAGHER : This is Mars-1 ground crew . Do you copy ? This is Mars-1 ground crew . Do you copy ? PETTENGIL : Maybe they 'll hear us back in 1997 . It 's been two hours . CONTROLLER : Mars-1 , Houston . Mars-1 , Houston . We 've picked something off a radio telescope pointed in your direction . You won 't believe this . You 'll have to tune to a frequency we haven 't used in 50 years . GALLAGHER : Yeah , well it was worth a shot . BOWMAN : Mars ground crew , this is Mars-1 . Do you copy ? Mars ground crew , this is Mars-1 . Bowman ! Bowman ! Gallagher ? [ CHUCKLES ] You 're alive . Yeah . Holy shit , you made it too . I know that HAB is wrecked . What is your status ? We 're down here at the little rover , what 's-its-name with Burchenal and Pettengil . Got no food and water , AMEE 's gone mustang and , oh , yeah , we can breathe . How can that be ? The oxygen levels are ... That is impossible . I don 't know . But we 're doing it . I saw a body back at MEV . Who was it ? That was Chantilas . Santen 's gone too . What happened ? Pettengil says he threw himself off a cliff . Anyway , that 's the news . We 're not gonna make it much longer . I hope you got an idea , because we 're fresh out . Okay , well , let me work on it . I 'll get back to you . I hope she has a magic wand . Houston , we have three men alive and breathing on Mars . Let 's bring them home . GALLAGHER : You just can 't get around it , can you ? I still can 't figure out this algae and oxygen business . You hate not knowing , don 't you ? - Given time , believe me , I 'll know . - Yeah , maybe . Maybe life 's just more mysterious than you think it is . You know , you spent too much time with Chantilas . But if you want to take the God route the easy way , that 's up to you . Easy way ? There 's nothing easy about a spiritual life . It 's a lot more difficult than just being intelligent . I think you 're just ignoring the facts . Facts . I bet you were no fun at Christmas . I bet your mom told you there 's no tooth fairy when you were 4 . I 'm a geneticist . I write code . Okay ? A , G , T , P in different combinations . Hacking the human genome . Okay ? I choose what , I choose where and either your kidneys work or you grow a sixth finger . I do that ! Now , you spot God you let me know . Until then , I 'll trust my Ph.Ds. BOWMAN : It might sound crazy , but it 's the only choice you got . We walk 100 kilometers to a 30-year-old Russian rock probe that failed to launch and try to jump-start it . Gee , why couldn 't you make it tough ? The probe 's called Cosmos . Houston found the designer , name 's Borokovski . Owns a deli in Brooklyn . He thinks you can start the launch sequence right there on site . Former rocket scientist who now specializes in making sandwiches . Terrific . Here 's the hard part : You got just under 19 hours to get there and get it off the ground . Then I take back what I said about it being tough . I gotta ditch the B tank and burn more fuel from A to hold orbit that long . I can 't burn much after that or Mars-1 won 't have enough fuel to get home . I need a heading . Which way should I go ? Okay , you want to go to your 5 : 00 . - There you go . GALLAGHER : Okay , we 're set . I got some work to do , then I 'll be in blackout on the dark side . So I 'll call you when I get back . Roger . Thanks . Sorry it 's not more . Hey , it 's something . Give me a hand . GALLAGHER : It 's nice just to know you 're still up there . Well , I don 't mind dying . I just hate being alone so get your asses back here . Talk to you later . Thanks . My rib feels like it 's through my lung . BOWMAN : Gallagher , what do you think ? GALLAGHER : I think it 's very distracting seeing you get out of the shower . I started to lock the door after that . No , you didn 't . - Yes , I did . - No , you didn 't . Good night . What 's that ? Over there . Looks like the ground 's moving . I didn 't see anything . It 's gone now , but I definitely saw something . BOWMAN : Gallagher ? Hey , Bowman . How you doing ? Need a headings check . You 're right on target . Listen , I need to talk to you . Took the comm off . What 's the matter ? Bowman ? The only place to ride the Cosmos is in the rock sample container . Sounds comfy . It 's very small . Borokovski and Houston have been trying to figure out how to cram three people in and it only fits two people . Two people , barely . How we doing ? Good . Great . I 'm sorry . Yeah , right . I 'll talk to you later . GALLAGHER : Let 's patch you up . It 'll help with the pain . BURCHENAL : I can barely breathe . This air 's too damn thin ! You 're gonna be okay . Put your arm over . That 's right . Left foot . Right foot . That 's right . Hop like a bunny . Just go . [ SINGING ] Here it comes , here it comes Here comes your 19th nervous breakdown What are you doing ? It 's a song my grandfather sang . The Rolling Stones . Come on , sing it . Here it comes Here comes your 19th nervous breakdown [ WIND WHISTLING ] [ THUNDER RUMBLING ] LUCILLE : Commander . A massive low-pressure system is approaching the crew . Atmospheric pressure 820 millibars . Gentlemen , a big ice storm 's coming straight for you . It 's the size of Montana , and it 's moving fast . I 'm going into comm blackout . You need to find shelter immediately . Now . Where are we gonna find shelter around here ? Over here ! There 's an opening ! LUCILLE : Maximum sustained winds : 111 miles per hour . Temperature : negative 50 degrees Fahrenheit . GALLAGHER : Hurry . Shit ! Houston , this is Mars-1 . [ GRUNTS ] How far is Cosmos from here ? What ? Cosmos . How far you think it is ? Five or six hours . Say five . That leaves us four hours to try and launch not counting whatever time we lose here . This Borokovski better have a good memory . Won 't be time for plan B. [ BLEEPING ] [ CLICKING ] Only two of us can go on Cosmos . What ? There 's only room on Cosmos for two people . You two will both go . You carry on with the mission . Tell people what they need to know , about what you learned here . When we get to Cosmos I 'll help you rig it , and then we 'll say goodbye . Heh . Probably won 't even launch . It is Russian , after all . Ten feet off the ground , it 'll explode . I 'll live longer than both of you . [ LAUGHING ] You 're a rare man , Gallagher . But somehow I don 't quite believe it . What are you talking about ? He thinks I 'm responsible for Santen 's death . What do you think , Gallagher ? Gallagher ? You trust me ? Do you ? I 'll watch your back , you watch mine ? Shit , I know I don 't trust you . But you 're going to leave your buddy here behind and take off with me ? [ CHUCKLES ] Yes , that 's ... That 's what he 's gonna do . CONTROLLER : Mars-1 , this is Houston . We don 't know about your clock , but ours is running out of time . Your team 's been out of contact over three hours . They did a great job getting this far but that 's a killer storm no one can survive . So here 's where we are : If you haven 't heard from your crew by the time you receive this you 're ordered to return home . Houston out . Gallagher , come in . Gallagher , can you hear me , please ? Shit . Burchenal . - He 's gone . - What ? He took the radio . Aw , shit . Shit ! [ AMEE WHIRRING ] It 's AMEE . She wants us to watch . [ PANTING ] She 's got him . He was afraid we were gonna leave him here . He made it come true . We gotta get that radio or we 're both dead too . BURCHENAL : We lost three hours . GALLAGHER : At least Pettengil 's heading in the right direction . - How do you know ? - I took a heading before the storm . And lined it up with the stars . We 're okay . BURCHENAL : Hey . [ BURCHENAL GROANING ] Hold on . This is algae . There 's algae here . Why is it here and nowhere else ? No time for that now . There 's Pettengil . BURCHENAL : At least he didn 't drop the goddamn radio . GALLAGHER : AMEE really tore him up . BURCHENAL : Ugh . Little shit 's got a death grip on it . Give me the radio . I 'll call Bowman . Why 'd he close his visor ? He didn 't have any air left . GALLAGHER : Bowman , it 's Gallagher . You up there ? Bowman , it 's Gallagher . Must still be on the dark side . Argh ! Jesus ! Some kind of nematode . The sparks ignited them . They 're feeding on the algae . That 's where it went . They 're feeding on the algae . Come on . Son of a bitch . Got it . - Thought there wasn 't any life here . - I was wrong . Where there 's water and air , there 's life . Think it 's so smart to take those things with us ? - You don 't get how important this is . - I 'm the janitor , remember ? Earth 's losing oxygen . See how those things burned ? They make it . They eat algae , and they make O-2 . I finally get it . I told you I 'd solve this damn thing . GALLAGHER : Why are the nematodes here ? BURCHENAL : Because there 's something left to eat . [ BURCHENAL GRUNTING ] BURCHENAL : Hang on . I haven 't seen green fields like this since I was a kid . Gallagher . Burchenal . They 're eating through my suit . Stay there . You 'll need my air . For the launch . Take this back , Gallagher . Accomplish the mission . It 's up to you now . Better put your helmet on . I 'm not going out like Pettengil . LUCILLE : Commander , there is a disturbance on the surface of Mars . Oh , God . BOWMAN : Mars ground crew , this is Mars-1 . Can you hear me ? Over . Mars ground crew , this is Mars-1 . Do you copy ? Over . Gallagher , what 's going on ? What 's happened ? Mars ground crew , this is Mars-1 . Can you hear me ? Over . [ GRUNTING ] GALLAGHER : I can 't go back . There was some kind of oxygen burn-off . It was like a blowtorch . - Burchenal 's gone . - Gallagher . He sacrificed himself . Gallagher , where are the others ? - I 've got to rest . - Gallagher . Where are the other guys ? Dead . All dead . - I 'm the only one left . - Gallagher , stop and listen to me . It 's over . I don 't know what happened tonight but you have come too far to give up now . You are going to accomplish the mission . I can 't . Burchenal sacrificed himself for you . You want to make that for nothing ? I want you to stand up and I want you to start walking . If you can 't do it for him , Gallagher ... - I can 't . - ... do it for me . Do it for me . You have to keep going . Okay . [ AMEE WHIRRING ] LUCILLE : Fifty-five minutes until we need to leave orbit , commander . - Time ? BOWMAN : Fifty-two minutes to go . Should be there by now . You 're almost there . I could have screwed up the celestial nav . - Could be off-course . - Trust me , you 're there . - Could 've run right past it . - Shut up and keep moving . I found it . Okay . What do I do now ? Get rid of the sample return tray . Okay . What next ? There 's an infrared maintenance port . It should be marked . Marked . Yeah . In Russian . All right . Got it . Now what ? Connect the radio to Cosmos . I 'll download what you need through the modem . [ COMPUTER SPEAKING RUSSIAN ] Still works . Go . [ COMPUTER SPEAKING RUSSIAN ] Okay , you should be able to run diagnostics now . [ COMPUTER SPEAKING RUSSIAN ] All green . Okay , now , this thing has two settings : on and off . Right now , " on " sends it all the way back to Earth . As you lack air , food and water , that would be bad . We want power to reach orbit . I 've recalculated for the weight of one . Take two liters out of each fuel tank . There 's a central purge . Russians couldn 't add a gas gauge ? I 'm going into comm blackout soon , we 're down to 49 minutes so shut up and get to work . Okay . What now ? Launch diagnostics . Avoid pressing anything that says " ignition . " [ COMPUTER SPEAKING RUSSIAN ] [ COMPUTER SPEAKING RUSSIAN ] Gallagher . Battery 's dead . There 's not enough power to launch . Not enough power to launch . - Anything else you can use ? - I don 't know . Let me look around . See if I see any alternate high-voltage sources . No . It 's just rocks . I 'll die on this planet . I 'll stay up here and we 'll find another way . You can 't stay there without burning more fuel to hold orbit . You gotta go . How much time till blackout ? About a minute . Okay . There 's a couple things I gotta tell you . There 's life here on Mars . The guys couldn 't figure how they got here , but they ate the algae and they ate HAB too . The important thing is that they make oxygen . Don 't know how but Burchenal said it might be able to save Earth so get some guys up here quick . Just tell them to be safe . They eat everything . LUCILLE : Thirty seconds , commander . Well , that 's about it . I , uh ... I really hate this planet . I really miss Earth . I really miss a lot of things . I , um ... I 'm gonna miss you . Aren 't you gonna say anything ? I should have kissed you . Yeah , you should 've kissed me . LUCILLE : Comm frequency lost , commander Goodbye . [ SINGING ] Here it comes Here it comes [ AMEE WHIRRING ] Alternate high-voltage energy source . Come and get me . I 'm gonna steal your batteries , sweetie . [ AMEE WHIRRING ] [ BLEEPING ] Bye , sweetie . [ SCREECHING ] [ WHIRRING ] [ GRUNTING ] I 'm going home . [ COMPUTER SPEAKING RUSSIAN ] Fuck this planet . COMPUTER : Oxygen supply is low . LUCILLE : Warning . Object in orbital path . Oh , my God . Gallagher . Abort ! Re-route orbital maneuvering . I need pitch . Roll ! Yaw . Ten-millimeter bursts . Seal this level . LUCILLE : Level sealed . Open the dock . Targeted object , .3 kilometers . We only have five minutes before Mars-1 leaves orbit , commander . Hook me up , Lucille ! Line release ! Full velocity ! Gallagher ! Gallagher ! Retract . Ninety-millimeter bursts ! Seal ! Emergency atmosphere now ! LUCILLE : Atmosphere restored . Linking to suit computer . Gallagher 's vital signs are negative . Bio-scan indicates cardiac arrest . Come on ! Come on ! Stand him up , commander . Come on . Aw , man . I saw Elvis . BOWMAN : Let 's go home , Lucille . Organism bio-scan . DNA mapping . Hard to believe they 're the good guys . Do you think it was worth it ? BOWMAN : Houston thinks so . On Earth , they 're calling you a hero , Gallagher . God works in mysterious ways . A memento ? It 's for Chantilas ' granddaughter . He had faith . You are not who I thought you were . BOWMAN : Nothing went the way it was supposed to . But the team , mankind at its best and its worst accomplished the mission . Maybe Chantilas was right . Maybe it isn 't just the science . I sure don 't know . But whatever forces were at work , we triumphed . And me ? I 've got six months before we get home . I guess I 'll get to know the janitor . [ English - US - SDH ]

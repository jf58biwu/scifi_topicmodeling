 What are you doing ? Prowler needs one of those Moya propulsar control units . From my module ? I don 't think so . It 's a matter of priorities , Crichton . You know which ship is more important . Yes , I know which one is more important to you , but ... Yes , the one that can actually get us out of trouble if we come under attack . I know someone who will soon be under attack if they don 't ... Pilot : Crichton ? Aeryn ? Yes , Mr. Bad News ? Moya 's senses have just picked something up . It appears to be actively tracking us . You were right . Put it in . Can you tell what it is ? No. lt doesn 't even seem to be a physical object , just energy . Zhaan , can you see it ? Pilot , I can 't get a visual but I estimate it will be upon us within 15 microts . Starting evasive maneuvers now . ( grunts ) What do you mean , it 's inside Moya ? It 's moving too fast to track , Pilot . ( humming ) Pilot , you there ? Crichton . What ? Aeryn . Aim high , but shoot it . Aeryn ! Come on , come on ! ( explosions ) Crichton . Crichton ! My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . A radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship , a living ship , full of strange alien life-forms . Help me . Listen , please . is there anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm being hunted by an insane military commander . I 'm doing everything I can . I 'm just looking for a way home . Whoa ! What the hezmana is that , and where 's Crichton ? lnside. lt sucked him in . Don 't ask me to explain it . Rygel : Can someone please tell what the yotz I 'm looking at ? Where are you ? I 'm in the passageway beneath Maintenance Bay Two . There 's some thing sticking through the ceiling . Don 't go near it , Rygel . You really think I need you to tell me that ? Aeryn : Pilot , what the frell is this thing ? Pilot : Unknown. I can 't make sense of these readings . Well , then , keep trying . I 'm getting contradictory data . There are energy fluctuations . It 's putting Moya under a great deal of stress . ( loud humming ) Aeryn : Pilot ? Pilot ! - Massive energy fluctuations ! Vacate the area immediately ! ( grunts ) Whoa ! D 'Argo , what the frell 's happening ? Keep your Comms open , and do not move until I say so . What ? Just do what I say . D 'Argo ! Just do it ! I got sucked into that ? You were inside it . Do you not remember anything ? Uh-uh. I , uh , I remember cold . Well , you 're going to have to focus a little bit more for me , John . I need to know , did you see anything , anyone inside there ? No . There was , uh ... light . I remember light , and I was , uh ... John , where have you cut yourself ? I 'm cut ? I 'm cut ? You 're not cut . No , no , I 'm not cut . Aeryn : It was the creature . The creature ? You weren 't the only thing to come out of that sphere . D 'Argo 's tracking it down now . Oh , God , another critter . Right , and I better go help him . John , you 're in no condition . No , no , I 'm okay , I just need a gun . Frell me ! What happened to you ? Well , that 's the $ 64,000 question . Aeryn , you got a gun ? John , please ... - No , I 'm okay . I just need to go help find the creature . ( grunts ) You all right ? - Okay . Did he really say creature ? Well , I don 't care how busy they are . I need more DRDs . Understood . They 're on their way . Oh , I take it you 're not having any luck . And I take it you aren 't going to lift a digit to help ! Well , if I see the creature , you 'll be the first to know . I 'll be sure to follow your screams . What about that all-powerful Luxan nose ? You 're always complaining you can smell me . Can 't you sniff this thing out ? I would , except all I can smell is Crichton . ( sighs ) I don 't get it , okay ? How could that ... that little , tiny light turn into this ... thing , and then suck you up and then spit out not only you , but ... Chiana , please . My head . I could probably use some extra clothes . Oh. I 'll be 20 microts . Thanks . This can 't be right . What can 't be right ? As far as I can tell , you received no injuries while you were in that sphere . Well , is that a bad thing ? Well , it means that this blood has to have come from the creature , but ... But what ? John , this blood is yours . This is where it gets good , right ? ( screaming ) ( grunting ) Please . What ... whatever ... whatever you want ... ( grunting ) Whatever you came for you ... you take it , okay ? ( snorts ) ( grunting ) Chia ... Chiana . You know my name ? Me ... John . Me ... John . I ... I don 't understand . ( grunting ) What are you ? ( roaring ) ( screaming ) No ! No ! D 'Argo ! Chiana . ( gasping ) Me ... John . Crichton . You are ... are Crichton . ( grunting ) You can 't be . You can 't be . Me ... John . Oh ... Chiana : We 're going to go see Zhaan , okay ? Crichton : Zhaan . She 's going to figure out what 's going on . Zhaan blue . You know Zhaan ? Mmm . Zhaan . Good . Oh . Good . Clothes ? - Uh , not quite . Whoa ! No , no , no ! It 's okay . I don 't think he wants to hurt anyone . Get away from him , Chiana . - l don 't think you need the gun . Where did you find him ? And what the hell is he doing in my flight suit ? He was in your quarters . Look at him . He thinks he 's you . What ? Right . All right , who are you and what do you want ? I am ... John ... Crichton . Yeah , that 's a superb disguise . It 's fooling everybody , but who are ? You . Me , you . God . Oh , God , I love this . Okay , you ... you want to stick with that routine ? You want to be the next to mess with me ? Well , get in line . - No ! Crichton . Chiana , I 'm sick of it . It 's bad enough being spat out of some green blob . Now I 've got Quasimodo here saying he 's me . Me ! You ! No , you 're not . What do you want ? Huh ? Wh-wh-what do you want ? You tell me . Tell me what you want , and maybe I can get it for you . Me ... want ... Oh , don 't touch me . Want to know . - Uh-uh . Hands off ! - Crichton ... ( shot injecting ) Please tell me that was just a sleep shot . Zhaan : It was . Oh , truly hideous . But take away the hair , the brow . I can see a resemblance to you , Crichton . Well it 's enough to make him think he 's you . Oh , please . This is not me . This is some kind of clone or something gone wrong . Yeah , but how does he ... how does he know everyone ? It 's like he 's got your memories . Chiana , half of this galaxy has my memories . Zhaan : John ? Yeah , Zhaan ? I 've run a full analysis on the blood . There are some minute chromosomal differences but apart from that , it 's exactly the same as yours . John , I 've done every test that I can . There can be no doubt . Great . It 's got my blood . My DNA . If Chiana 's right , it 's got a lot more than that . That 's nuts. I mean , who in their right mind would want a copy of me , much less this caveman version ? D 'Argo : Caveman ? Yeah , it 's a primitive ancestor . They were supposed to have looked like that . You had ancestors that looked like that ? Yeah . What did yours look like ? ( rumbling ) Pilot ! It 's the sphere ! Energy fluctuations have recommenced . Oh , hell , let 's go ! Chiana , stay here . Oh ... Aeryn , what 's it doing up there ? Same as before . Pilot , what are you reading ? Same energy fluctuations , only more powerful and increasing . Let 's get the hell out of here . Aeryn , Pilot , you guys okay ? Energy fluctuations are still present , but diminished . Crichton , you 'd better get up here . Aeryn ... Don 't move . Look , I 'm freezing here . And why the hell are you pointing a gun at me ? Who are you ? I 'm John . John Crichton . I don 't think so . For a start , John has more hair , amongst other things . You gonna blame that on feeling cold ? What the hell happened to me ? Listen , I understand why you 're doing this , but ... Ah . At least you can talk , so start . Who are you , and what do you know about the sphere ? Oh , I know as much as you do . is that ' cause you 're supposed to be me ? Look , I understand the bizarreness of this situation . But I 'm telling you the truth . I am John Crichton . No. I 'm John Crichton . I don 't doubt that you 're telling the truth . Good . Excellent . We 're making progress . I get to be me . Ergo , you 're not me . Well , no . Not as I normally perceive myself . There are some physical differences . Just some . ( chuckles ) Yes . Look , perhaps it would help if you thought of me as an alternative version of yourself . I don 't want to think of you at all . Well , you have that luxury . I don 't . In my memories , I look like you . Your memories ? Yes . I perceived myself as having linear life . I don 't believe you . No ? I didn 't think that you would . Okay . When the Farscape project received funding , what did I do ? Celebrated with Dad , D.K. and Alex . Drank a little too much champagne that cost way too much . Argued with D.K. Wait . What argument ? He thought that things were going too smoothly . That something had to go wrong . You do remember ? Yeah , I , uh ... I told him he was full of crap . I 'd completely forgotten that . ( loud crashing ) Pilot ! Pilot : New activity from the sphere ! I 'm analyzing . D 'Argo , Maintenance Bay . Aeryn , stay with him . See what you can find out about the sphere . ( grunting ) Pilot , status ? Are we about to get another me ? I don 't think so . They 're different readings than before . In what way ? Pilot ? ! This can 't be . It ... it appears that the sphere is generating some sort of interdimensional portal . Whoa ! Whoa ! This blob is creating a dimensional hole ? Yes , and it 's actively trying to pull us through . I estimate we have less than a quarter arn before it pulls us through . Right . Know anything about this ? How many times , Aeryn ? I don 't know anything . All right , Pilot , you got any ideas ? I 'm trying everything I can . What about Starburst ? Perhaps we can blast clear of it . The portal is being generated by the sphere and the sphere is inside Moya . We cannot escape it . Right . Well , what the hell can we use ? Give me your Comms . Why ? I have an idea . Give me your Comms . ( laughs ) Listen , Aeryn . Do you want to be pulled through to another dimension ? No , but perhaps you do . I 'm not some interdimensional alien . If this ship gets pulled through , I get pulled through as well . So give me your Comms . Aeryn , trust me . Fine , then at least get them a message . Tell them to use the Defense Screen . It 's all we 've got . The Defense Screen . What ? The Defense Screen . We use it to counteract the pull of the dimensional hole . Uh-uh , I don 't see that ... Look , I 'm not entirely sure here . I 'm just kind of ripping it as I go . But the Defense Screen deflects energy , right ? Right . - So we use it to counteract the pull . I 'm in Bill and Ted land here , so I 'm open to suggestion . Crichton . What ? Your mutation has a suggestion . Oh , good . Listen , you have to use the Defense Screen to counteract ... Both Crichtons : the pull of the dimensional hole . Man , I hope we 're both right . Command . Sounds like he knew what you were thinking . You trust me now ? No . We still don 't know if it 's going to work . ( loud crashing ) And it won 't work if they don 't set it up right . Aeryn , get me to the Maintenance Bay . At gunpoint if you have to , but get me to the Maintenance Bay . At gunpoint . I don 't know that it is going to work , Mr. Rygel . I 'm just going on a gut instinct . Something I 'm sure you can appreciate . We should be heading for a Transport , not frelling about with the Defense Screen , hoping it 'll do something . Then go to a Transport ! At least then if we die , we 'll die in peace . Pilot , are you ready to transfer power to the Defense Screen ? Ready . Good , ' cause we 're about finished here . John , what power settings are you using ? Everything 's set at 100 % . Why ? I 'm afraid you 're going to have to recalibrate . ( growls ) No , no , no . We are not recalibrating anything . We give this thing everything we 've got . The settings have to be synchronized with readings from the sphere or they 'll never counteract the pull . There has to be synchronism . Recalibrate to 85 % . Rygel : You 're not going to seriously do what he says , are you ? Shift them down ! Shift them down ! You 're mad ! Pilot , are you good to go up there ? On your command ! D 'Argo ... Right . Do it now ! - l 'm doing it . ( deep rumbling ) ( electrical crackling ) Pilot : It worked . The screen 's deflecting the sphere 's energy back on itself . It stopped dragging us in . You son of a bitch . He was right . Impressive . I 'm pleased that it worked . But we 're not out of the woods yet . Pilot , how long can we hold out ? Our energy levels won 't last forever . I estimate the Defense Screen will be able to counteract the pull of the sphere for only four arns , perhaps less . That 's assuming the Defense Screen itself holds out . We should work under the basis that we have less than three arns . ( grunts ) Hey ... Hey ! It 's okay . It 's me . Pip . ( sniffs ) What happened ? You lost it for a microt . You remember ? ( grunts ) Sphere ? ( sniffing ) Must know how ... what happened . Chiana . I can 't tell you anything . I 've ... I 've had my Comms off . I didn 't want to wake you . ( snorts ) Must know . ( grunting ) ( yelling ) Hey , easy ! Calm down ! Crichton ! John ! That is your name , right ? Who you are ? Was me . What do you mean , was ? Look . ( grunts ) John no more . Gone . Well , it doesn 't look as though we 'll learn anything here . ( growling ) Who the frell are you ? Apparently , another Crichton . Another ? Hello , Pip . I don 't suppose he 's told you anything useful about the sphere ? You don 't have to go through me . Ask him yourself . You me , too ? Would there really be any point ? Looking at him , however , does raise some interesting possibilities . There seems to a pattern in my replication . Don 't you mean Crichton 's replications ? Indeed . He is the template . The original . And on the one hand we have this version , who seems barely able to think , on the other hand ... You . Mmm . Pilot , have you attempted to communicate with the sphere ? It hasn 't responded to any of my signals . But it is sending out a number of its own . Commander Crichton has already started looking at them . Of course he has . Stand by for the first signals . I told you I 've already analyzed this signal . I understand that , but we 're going to analyze it again . When you 're ready , Pilot . ( high-pitched whining ) Can you try a lower pitch , please ? ( low-pitched whining ) Now try filtering out the third and fifth harmonics . ( laughing ) Listen to this . Double the Crichton and you double the waste of time . That 's very funny , Rygel . - We really should be paying more attention to this Defense Shield . It 's already showing signs of strain . Yes ... ( loud buzzing ) Ow ! Finally stopped . ( groans ) What stopped ? You can 't hear this ? So much for that . You can 't hear that ? Alien voice : A sample .. . Rygel : Crichton , would you mind explaining ... Shut up , Fluffy . Translating to alien brain wave pattern . Translating to alien brain wave pattern . You incapacitated our sample collection vessel , resulting in the loss of the targeted sample and genetic derivatives . Internal repairs have been completed . But our vessel cannot return unless it carries at least one of the target samples . If a sample is not placed within the vessel , it will automatically retrieve all biological matter within one metra of its radius . We do not wish to harm you . To avoid inadvertent damage place one of the targeted samples into our vessel . One of the targeted sample .. . ( transmission stops ) One ... must go back . Fascinating . We have an answer . Crichton , what is going on ? One of us has got to die . D 'Argo : A sample ? Yes , apparently that 's what I am . And what if the sphere 's not got what it came for ? Then it 's gonna take all of us . To another dimension ? Ha ha ha ... I don 't think so . Sorry , Crichton . Perhaps we can spare each of you a small last meal . One , Rygel. lt wants one of me . Only one ? You mean we 're going to be left with two of you ? Look , just because the sphere wants a Crichton , it doesn 't mean it has to be you , okay ? Will be me . ( grunts ) Who else ? What about the guy with the big head ? ( chuckling ) Hey , you 've got just as much right to be here as he does . Futuro : A remarkable device . You understand what this is ? This is a pure research vessel , devoted to the study of life . Yes , it 's a remarkable device . I just wish it 'd chosen some other life to study . Why me ? Why not all of us ? Because it 's never seen anything ... like us before . - like me before . Correct . It 's already had a chance to collect a Luxan , a Delvian ... and one of everyone else on board . I 'd wager that your replication , or should I say , my creation , is a byproduct of its research . A mapping of our genetic pathways . D 'Argo : Enough. I don 't care what this thing does . All I know is that I want to get rid of it . Understandable . And unfortunately , we have an answer . We return the most expendable one of us . What ? Nah , I don 't think so . Oh , come on . Are you going to say he 's wrong ? Let 's just give the sphere the hairy bastard and get it the frell out of here . Well , not quite as I would have phrased it , Rygel , but ... We 're getting way ahead of ourselves here , guys . Way ahead . What if we 're wrong ? Huh ? We 're going to chuck him to the sphere like he 's nothing ? We can 't do that . I can . And what if there 's another solution ? One that we haven 't found yet ? John , you heard the message . Yes , I heard the message . But we just bought ourselves a couple of arns and we 're going to use it to find another solution . No , no . You 're losing perspective . No , I am widening my perspective . That is what I do . That 's what makes me me . Crichton , what 's the alternative ? I try and shoot at this thing again ? Aeryn , that is a bad plan . You really don 't want another me . John , let 's just ... - What , D 'Argo ? You going to tell me I 'm wrong ? Since when do we take the easy way out ? ( sighing ) is anyone with me on this ? Not me . Very well . Let 's try and see what we can find . But , John ? When the time comes ... Yes . Pilot , I want every reading you have on that sphere . All of them . Pilot : Very well , Crichton . I know Crichton , okay ? You know Crichton . You are him , for frell 's sake . Look , I promise you , he 's not going to quit , till he fixes this . ( grunts ) Know Crichton . Yeah . Save Moya . Save Pip . ( grunts ) Only one answer . I 've transferred all collected information on the sphere to a data console in the Maintenance Bay . The other Crichton has stared an analysis . You don 't think he 's going to have much luck , do you ? Very perceptive . We have to try , Pilot . With all respect , I 've analyzed their data four times . I doubt any new insights will be gained . Pilot , I am not going to let Moya get sucked into this sphere . Neither am I . Crichton , I should tell you . Moya would never expect an innocent being to die for her sake . She will understand if you choose to leave . We 're not going to do that . I know , but ... while I would never want my fate to be different to Moya 's I do not share her acceptance of this situation . If we have the solution then I ... ls what I am trying to find , Pilot . And I am not going to stop until I have to . Do you understand that ? I ... understand . Good . Now let 's see if we can get a message to these body-snatchers . Ahh ! It 's the Defense Screen ! Crichton ! We have a power drain ! Can we reroute through the Neural Cluster ? I 'm already on it . We need you in Command . On the way ! Feels as though our options on how to resolve this are becoming limited . We are not giving up . Look at the data , Zhaan . I 'm thinking with more speed and clarity than I ever have before , and I 'm still only able to absorb a fraction of this . Something may reveal itself . Yes , things are revealing themselves . They 're just not pertinent to this situation . It 's amazing , Zhaan , what 's happened to me . Virtually without even trying , I 'm beginning to understand concepts that I 've been thinking about for months , years . You may find a solution here if you try . No . This is over . We know what the outcome will be . I 'm talking about the future , about what 's possible . You 're just going to give up ? I 'm going to face reality . This is reality . No . This is futile . You are not the John Crichton I know . Zhaan , look at what 's happened to me . How could I be ? I wonder if you can also see what you have lost . Your logic may be firm , but it is cold . But correct . When all the options have been exhausted , the John Crichton you know will reach the same conclusion . I get there quicker . That 's the only difference . And I know that you 'll get there , too . The reserve power unit 's completely burned out . The Defense Screen was not made for this . Just give me whatever power you got . We 're already feeding you as much as we can ! I don 't want to hear that , Aeryn . Well we 're running out of options , Crichton . John . - We can 't keep redoing this . D 'Argo ? I want you to know that if you have to get rid of one of the Crichtons , I 'm there for you . I appreciate the offer , D 'Argo , but I 'm not giving up yet . I understand . But I also want you to know that if you don 't start facing reality soon , I 'm going to face it for you . Just give me some more time . Crichton ! D 'Argo , just give me more time . Now , I want all the power you got . Transferring power . Whoa ! The Defense Screen 's down to its last power cell . It cannot be recharged while the screen is active . You must do something now . It 's time . I know . Would you like me to take care of it ? is that a yes ? How can you sound so calm ? You think I don 't feel for him ? Of course I do . But I 'm prepared to do what has to be done . Now , would you like me to take care of it ? No . I 'll take care of it . John , don 't feel bad . You knew this moment was coming . I appreciate you coming with me , D 'Argo . I would not have you do it alone . Besides , I do not think he will go voluntarily . Chiana : Looking for someone ? Where is he ? Hiding . Chiana . What ? You think I 'd just let you kill him ? I set him free . How could you have done this ? Frell you , D 'Argo . Where is he ? Somewhere you 'll never find . Do you know what you 've done ? We had a simple choice . Simple . He dies , we live . Now we all die ! Moya dies ! We have two choices left . Two ? ! I 'm the one who 's supposed to be here ! Do you think I should go in there ? Yeah ? Well , what about your bald headed friend ? He meant to be here , too ? I tried to find another way . Oh , yeah , I bet you did . Damn it , Chiana , that is not fair ! Fair ? You think this guy 's nothing ? He 's you ! He 's warm . He 's sensitive . He 's everything I ever liked about you . You take Tiers One to Three . I 'll take Four to Seven . Update , Pilot . Remaining power cell down to 15 % . The DRDs still report no sign of the other Crichton . I 'll check the rest of this Tier . Then we 'll have to move on to the next one . Aeryn , I think it 's time we reassess . I 'm guessing you 're not going to volunteer to go in the sphere . Correct . You 've seen what I can do . I can help this crew . What do you suggest I do now ? Start hunting Crichton ? It would make sense . To you , yes , but you don 't belong here . You 're a mistake . So you 'd better pray we find the other one . Aeryn ... Sorry . Rygel ! You stupid , bony-assed little bitch . What were you thinking ? - What was I thinking ? It was self-preservation . I thought you of all people would 've understood that . Even Crichton understood it . What are you doing ? What do you think ? The first Crichton I see gets this in the back of his head . No way . Yeah ! We 're all going to die if one of them doesn 't . No way ! - Yes , way ! And I don 't care which one it is . It 's your doing , Chiana . - Rygel ! Rygel ! ( grunting and snarling ) How ? How did I know where to find you ? I knew where l 'd go if I wanted to hide . Do you know why I 'm here ? Sphere . Yeah . I 'm letting you go . Get out of here . Go ! Move it ! Crichton. I 've found him . Meet me in the Maintenance Bay . On my way . Where is he ? I let him go . I thought you would . John , you had your chance . And you blew it . You let your emotions get the better of you . You couldn 't face reality . You wanna face reality ? Face reality ? We were saving ourselves at someone else 's expense . Who wasn 't worth saving . Come on , Johnnie . Don 't tell me you didn 't think that . I could see a part of you still thinks it . Remember the way you first saw the ape-man ? How you could legitimize sacrificing him ? Well , guess what . That 's the way I see you . Tell me something . If I wasn 't here , you wouldn 't volunteer to go in the sphere , would you ? Moya might emerge through the dimensional portal unscathed . I 'd take that risk . Oh , yeah . Aren 't you special ? With an attitude like that , you really think you 're the best of the three of us ? You know I am . Yeah , you 're fantastic . You 're gonna fit in great around here . The rest of the crew 's just gonna love ya . They will when they see what I can do for them . You just told me you 'd sell ' em down the river . Let em go through the portal . I tell you what . You ever want to know what it was like to have them as friends ? Just think back to when you were me . You 're very judgmental for someone who 's still hiding . No , I 'm not . We 're out of time . Bet you didn 't guess that move . You 're very predictable . I prefer to think of it as reliable . Oh . You understand it has to be this way . I could never really be me with you still around . I 'd always be the outsider . Smarter , more capable , yet not quite John . ( rumbling ) Can you understand how frustrating that would be ? You think you 're ever going to be anything but an outsider ? Better than dying . So you 're the future . I 'm glad I won 't be here to see it . Dead ? Yeah . Good . Hey ! Hey , you don 't have to do that . Want to . Not my place . Don 't belong . Look , I don 't ... I don 't really belong here either . Your time . Your place . My fate . I accept . I understand . I understand . Good luck . How 's Aeryn ? Well , she 's doing better than this Defense Screen . I think she 's doing better than you . You look terrible . I 've had better days . You did what you thought was right , John . And I did what I knew was wrong . The future Crichton . Kind of makes you wonder if that 's where we 're headed . It 's only one possible genetic path . Yeah , but it 's possible . That 's the problem . I heard about what you did . You really offered to take the dive ? It took me a while , and then I needed some help . Well , for what it 's worth , I 'm glad it worked out the way it did . I wish I could be . I always thought I was a good guy , Chiana . But it was the least developed one of me , the one I thought least likely , who did the right thing . Somehow you knew . I know you .

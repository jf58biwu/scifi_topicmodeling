 What are you doing ? Prowler needs one of those Moya propulsor control units . From my module , I don 't think so . It 's a matter of priorities Crichton , you know which ship is more important . Yes , I know which ship is more important to you , but ... Yes , the one that can actually get us out of trouble if we come under attack . I know someone ... who will soon be under attack ... if they don 't ... richton ? Aeryn ? Yes , Mister Bad News . Moya 's senses have just picked something up . It appears to be actively tracking us . You were right , put it in . Can you tell what it is ? No . It doesn 't even seem to be a physical object . Just ... energy . Zhaan , can you see it ? Pilot , I can 't get a visual . But I estimate it will be upon us in ... fifteen microts . Starting evasive maneuvers ... now ! What do you mean it 's inside Moya ? It 's moving too fast to track , Pilot ! Pilot , you there ? Crichton . What ? Aeryn , aim high . But shoot it ! Aerynnnnnnnn ! Crichton ! Crichton ! My name is John Crichton ... an astronaut ... radiation wave hit me ... I got shot through a wormhole ... lost in some distant part of the universe ... on a ship a living ship full of strange alien life - forms ... help ... Listen please ... Is anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm Being hunted by an insane military commander ... Doing everything I can ... I 'm just looking for a way home . Whoa ! What the hezmana is that and where is Crichton ? Inside . It sucked him in , don 't ask me to explain it . Can someone please tell me what the yotz I 'm looking at ? Where are you ? I 'm in the passageway beneath ... maintenance bay two . There 's some thing sticking through the ceiling ! Don 't go near it , Rygel . You really think I need you to tell me that ? Pilot , what the frell is this thing ? Unknown ! I can 't make sense of these readings . Well then keep trying . I 'm getting contradictory data ! There are energy fluctuations . It 's putting Moya under a great deal of stress . Pilot ? Pilot ! Massive energy fluctuations ! Vacate the area immediately ! D 'argo ! W - what the frell 's ... Keep your comms open and do not move until I say so ! What ? Just do as I say ! D 'argo ! Just do it ! I got sucked into that ? You were inside it . Do you not remember anything ? Huh uh . I uh ... I remember cold . Well you 're gonna have to focus a little bit more for me , John . I need to know ... did you see anything , anyone , inside there ? No . There was uh ... light . I remember light . A - a - and I was uh ... John , where have you cut yourself ? I 'm cut ? Am I cut ? You 're not cut . No , no , I 'm not cut . It was the creature . The creature ? You weren 't the only thing to come out of that sphere . D 'argo 's tracking it down now . Oh God , another critter . Right , I better go help him . John , you 're in no condition . No , no , I 'm okay , I just need a gun . Frell me . What happened to you ? Well , that 's the sixty - four thousand dollar question . Aeryn , you got a gun ? John , please ... No , I 'm okay , I jus need to go help find the creature . You alright ? 'Kay . Did he really say creature ? Well I don 't care how busy they are , I need more DRDs ! Understood . They 're on their way . Oh , I take it you 're not having any luck . And I take it you aren 't going to lift a digit to help ! Well if I see the creature , you 'll be the first to know . I 'll be sure to follow your screams . What about that all - powerful Luxan nose ? You 're always complaining you can smell me . Can 't you ... sniff this thing out ? I would . Except all I can smell ... is Crichton . I don 't get it . Okay ? How could that that little tiny light turn into this ... .. thing , and then ... then suck you up and then spit out not only you ... Chiana please , my head . I could probably use some extra clothes ? oh . I 'll be twenty microts . Thanks . This can 't be right . What can 't be right ? As far as I can tell , you received no injuries while you were in that sphere . Well is that a bad thing ? Well , it means that this blood has to have come from the creature . But ... But what ? John , this blood is yours . This is where it gets good , right ? Please . W. . whatever ... whatever you want ... . Ch , Ch ... Whatever you came for you ... you take it , okay ? Chia ... Chiana . You know my name ? Me ... Joh . Mmm ... mmm Joh . I ... I don 't understand . What are you ? D 'argo ! Chiana . Me . John ! Crich - tooooon You are ... are Crichton ? You can 't be . You can 't be . Me ... John ... We 're gonna go see Zhaan , okay ? Zhaan . She 's gonna figure out what 's going on . Zhaan , blue . You know Zhaan ? Zhaan . Good . Good . Clothes ? Uh , not quite . No , no , no , it 's okay ! I uh ... I don 't think he wants to hurt anyone . Get away from him Chiana . I don 't think you need the gun . Where did you find him ? And what the hell is he doin ' in my flight suit ? It was in your quarters . Look at him . He thinks he 's you . What ? Right . Alright . Who are you , and what do you want ? I 'm me . John . Crich - toh . Yeah . That 's a uh , superb disguise , it 's foolin ' everybody . Who are you ? You . You . God . Oh , God I love this . Okay , y - y - you wanna stick with that routine ? You wanna be the next to mess with me ? Well get in line ! No , Crichton ! Chiana ! I 'm sick of it ! It 's bad enough being spat out of some green blob , now I 've got Quasimodo here saying he 's me ! Me ! You ! No . You 're not . What do you want ? Huh ? Wh - wh - wh - wh what do you want ? Y - y - y - ou tell me ! Tell me what you want and maybe I can get it for you . Want ... Uh uh , don 't touch me . Wanna know ... Hands off ! Crichton ! Please tell me that was just a sleep shot . It was . Truly hideous ! But , take away the hair , the brow , I ... I can see a resemblance to you , Crichton . Well , it 's enough to make him think he 's you . Oh , please . This is not me , this is some kind of clone or something , gone wrong . Yeah , but how does he ... how does he know everyone ? It 's like he 's got your memories . Chiana , half of this galaxy has my memories . John ? Yeah , Zhaan ? I 've ran a full analysis on the blood . There are some minute chromosomal differences , but ... apart from that , it 's exactly the same as yours . John , I 've done every test that I can . There can be no doubt . Great . It 's got my blood . My DNA . Chiana 's right . It 's got a lot more than that . That 's nuts . I mean , who in their right mind would want a copy of me , much less this ... caveman version ? Caveman ? Yeah , it 's a primitive ancestor . They were supposed 've looked like that . You had ancestors that looked like that ? Yeah . What did yours look like ? Pilot ! It 's the sphere ! Energy fluctuations have re - commenced ! Aw , hell ! Let 's go ! Chiana , stay here ! Aeryn , what 's it doing up there ? Same as before . Pilot , what are you reading ? Same energy fluctuations , only more powerful ! And increasing ! Let 's get the hell out of here ! Aeryn , Pilot , you guys okay ? Energy fluctuations are still present . But , diminished . Crichton , you 'd better get up here . Aeryn . Don 't move . Look , I 'm freezin ' here . And why the hell are you pointing ' a gun at me ? Who are you ? I 'm John . John Crichton . I don 't think so . For a start , John has more hair . Amongst other things . Are you gonna blame that on feeling cold ? What the hell happened to me ? Listen . I understand why you 're doing this , but ... . At least you can talk . So start . Who are you and what do you know about the sphere ? Oh , I know as much as you do . Is that because you 're supposed to be me ? Look , I understand the bizarreness of the situation , but I 'm telling you the truth . I am John Crichton . No , I 'm John Crichton . I don 't ... I don 't doubt that you 're telling the truth . Good . Excellent . We 're making progress . I get to be me ! Ergo , you are not me . Well , no . Not as I ... normally perceive myself . There are some ... physical differences . Just some ? Yes . Look , perhaps it would help if you thought of me as an alternative version ... of yourself . I don 't wanna think of you at all . Well , you have that luxury . I don 't . In my memories , I look like you . Your memories ? Yes . I perceive myself as having lead your life . I don 't believe you . No . I didn 't think that you would . Okay . When the Farscape project ... received funding , what did I do ? Celebrated with Dad , DK and Alex . Drank a little too much Champagne that cost way too much . Argued with DK . Wait . What argument ? He thought that things were going too smoothly . That something had to go wrong . You do remember . Yeah ... I uh ... I told him he was full of crap . I 'd completely forgotten that . Pilot ! New activity from the sphere ! I 'm analyzing it ! D 'argo , maintenance bay . Aeryn , stay with him , see what you can find out about the sphere ! Pilot , status ! Are we about to get another me ? I don 't think so . They 're different readings than before . In what way ? Pilot ! This can 't be ! It ... it appears that the sphere is generating some sort of ... interdimensional portal ! Whoa , whoa ! This blob is creating a dimensional hole ? Yes , and it 's actively trying to pull us through ! I estimate we have less than a quarter arn before it pulls us through ! Right . Know anything about this ? How many times Aeryn ? I don 't know anything . Alright Pilot , you got any ideas ? I 'm trying everything I can ! What about Starburst ? Perhaps we can blast clear of it . The portal is being generated by the sphere and the sphere is inside Moya . We cannot escape it . Right . Well what the hell can we use ? Give me your comms . Why ? I have an idea . Give me your comms . Listen , Aeryn . Do you wanna be pulled through to another dimension ? No , but perhaps you do . I 'm not some sort of interdimensional alien . If this ship gets pulled through , I get pulled through as well . So ... give me your comms . Aeryn , trust me . Fine , then at least get them a message . Tell them to use the defense screen , it 's all we 've got . The defense screen ! What ? The defense screen . We use it to counter - act the pull of the dimensional hole ! Uh uh , I don 't that ... Look , I 'm not entirely sure here , I 'm just kinda riffing ' as I go . But ... the defense screen deflects energy , right ? Right . So we use it to counter - act the pull . I 'm in Bill and Ted land here , so I 'm open to suggestion ! Crichton . What ? Your mutation has a suggestion . Oh good . Listen , you have to use the defense screen to counter - act the pull of the dimensional hole . Man , I hope we 're both right . Command ! Sounds like he knew what you were thinking . You trust me now . No . We still don 't know if it 's going to work . It won 't work if they don 't set it up right . Aeryn , get me to the maintenance bay . At gunpoint if you have to , but get me to the maintenance bay ! At gunpoint . I don 't know that it is going to work , Mister Rygel , I 'm just going on a gut instinct . Something I 'm sure you can appreciate . We should be heading for a transport , not frelling about with a defense screen , hoping it will do something ! Then go to a transport ! At least then if we die , we 'll die in peace ! Pilot , are you ready to transfer power to the defense screen ? Ready . Good , cause we 're about finished , here . John , what power settings are you using ? Everything 's set at a hundred percent , why ? I 'm afraid you 're gonna have to recalibrate . No , no - no - no - no . We are not re - calibrating anything , we give this thing everything we 've got . The settings have to be synchronized with readings from the sphere or they 'll never counter - act the pull . They have to be synchronous . Recalibrate to eighty - five percent . You 're not seriously gonna do what he says , are you ? Shift 'em down ! Shift 'em down ! You 're mad ! Pilot , are you good to go up there ? On your command ! D 'argo ! Ready . Do it now ! Doing it ! It worked ! The defense screen is deflecting the sphere 's energy back on itself ! It stopped dragging us in . Son ' bitch . He was right . Impressive . I 'm pleased that it worked . But we 're not out of the woods yet . Pilot , how long can we hold out ? Our energy levels won 't last forever . I estimate the defense screen will be able to counter - act the pull of the sphere for only ... four arns . Perhaps less . That 's assuming the defense screen itself holds out . We should work under the basis that we have less than three arns . Hey ! Hey ! Heeeey . It 's okay . It 's me , Pip . What happened ? Y - you lost it for a microt . You remember ? Sphere . Must know ... What happened . Chiana . I can 't tell you anything . I 've ... I 've had my comms off . I didn 't want to wake you . Must know ! Hey ! Please , calm down ! Crichton ! John ! That is your name , right ? Who you are ? Was me . What do you mean " was " ? Look . John no more . Gone . Well , doesn 't look as though we 'll learn anything here . Who the frell are you ? Apparently another Crichton . Another ? Hello Pip . I don 't suppose he 's told you anything useful about the sphere ? You don 't have to go through me . Ask him yourself . You me , too . Would there really be any point ? Looking at him however , does raise some ... interesting possibilities , there seems to be a pattern to my replication . Don 't you mean Crichton 's replications ? Indeed . He is the template , the original . And on the one hand we have this version , who seems barely able to think , and on the other hand ... You . Pilot . Have you attempted to communicate with the sphere ? It hasn 't responded to any of my signals . But it is sending out a number of it 's own . Commander Crichton has already started looking at them . Of course he has . Stand by for the first signals . I 've told you , I 've already analyzed this signal . I understand that , but we 're gonna analyze it again . When you 're ready , Pilot . Can you try a lower pitch , please ? Now try filtering out the third and fifth harmonics . Listen to this . Double the Crichton and you double the waste of time ! That 's very funny Rygel . We really should be paying more attention to this defense shield . It 's already showing signs of strain . Yes . Finally , it stopped . What stopped ? You can 't hear this ? So much for that . You can 't hear that ? Crichton , would you mind explaining ? Shut up , Fluffy . Translating to alien brainwave pattern . Translating to alien brainwave pattern . You incapacitated our sample collections vessel . Resulting in the loss of the targeted sample , and genetic derivatives . Internal repairs have been completed , but our vessel cannot return unless it carries at least one of the targeted samples . If the sample is not placed within the vessel , it will automatically retrieve all biological matter , within one metra of it 's radius . We do not wish to harm you . To avoid any further damage , place one of the targeted sample into our vessel . One of the targeted sample . One ... Must go back . Fascinating . We have an answer . Crichton . What is going on ? One of us is gonna die . A sample . Yes , apparently that 's what I am . And what if the sphere 's not got what it came for ? Then it 's gonna take all of us . To another dimension ? ha ha ha . . I don 't think so ! Sorry Crichton . Perhaps we can spare each of you a small last meal . One , Rygel . It wants one of me . Only one ? You mean we 're gonna be left with two of you ? Look , just cause the sphere wants a Crichton , it doesn 't mean it has to be you , okay ? Will be me . Who else ? What about the guy with the big head ? Hey , you have just as much right to be here as he does . A remarkable device . You understand what this is ? This is a pure research vessel . Devoted to the study of life . Yes , it 's a remarkable device , I just wish it had chosen some other life to study . Hey , why me ? Why ... why not all of us ? Because it 's never seen anything like us before . Correct . It 's already had a chance to collect a Luxan , a Delvian ... And one of everyone else on board . I 'd wager that your ... replication , or should I say my creation , is a by - product of it 's research . A mapping of our genetic pathways . Enough ! I don 't care what this thing does , all I know is that I want to get rid of it ! Understandable . And unfortunately , we have an answer . We return the most expendable one of us . What ? No , I don 't think so . Oh , come on ! Are you going to say he 's wrong ? Let 's just give the sphere the hairy bastard and get it the frell out of here ! Well , not quite as I would have phrased it Rygel , but ... We 're getting way ahead of ourselves , guys . Way ... ahead . What if we 're wrong ? W - wh - we 're gonna chuck him to the sphere like he 's nothing ? We can 't do that ! I can . What if there 's another solution ? One that we haven 't found yet ? John , you heard the message . Yes , I heard ... the message ! But we just bought ourselves a couple of arns , and we 're gonna use ... it to find another solution . No , no , you 're losing perspective . No , I am widening my perspective , that is what I do , that 's what makes me me ! Crichton , what 's the alternative ? I try and shoot at this thing again ? Aeryn , that is a bad plan , you really don 't want another me . John ... What , D 'argo ? Are you gonna tell me I 'm wrong ? Since when do we take the easy way out ? Is anyone with me on this ? Not me . Very well . Let 's try and see what we can find . But , John . When the time comes ... Yes . Pilot , I want every reading you have on that sphere . All of them . Very well , Crichton . I know Crichton , okay ? You know Crichton . You are him , for frell 's sake . Look , I promise you , he 's not gonna to quit . Til he fixes this . Know Crichtoh . yes Save Moya . Save ... Pip . Only one answer . I 've transferred all collected information on the sphere to a data console in the maintenance bay . The other Crichton has started an analysis . You don 't think he 's gonna have much luck , do ya ? Very perceptive . We have to try , Pilot . With all respect , I 've analyzed that data four times . I doubt any new insights will be gained . Pilot , I am not gonna to let Moya get sucked into the sphere . Neither am I. Crichton , I should tell you , Moya would never expect an innocent being to die for her sake . She will understand if you chose to leave . We 're not gonna do that . I know . But while I would never want my fate to be different to Moya 's , I do not share her acceptance of this situation . If we have a solution , then I su ... Is what I am trying to find , Pilot , and I am not gonna stop until I have to . Do you understand that ? I ... . understand . Good . Now let 's see if we can get a message to these body snatchers . It 's the defense screen ! Pilot , we have a power drain ! Can we re - route through the neural cluster ? I 'm already onto it . We need you in command ! On the way ! It appears as though our options on how to resolve this have become limited . We are not giving up . Look at the data , Zhaan . I 'm thinking with more speed and clarity than I ever have before , and I 'm still only able to absorb a fraction of this . Something may reveal itself . Yes , things are revealing themselves , they 're just not pertinent to this situation . It 's amazing , Zhaan , what 's happened to me . Virtually without even trying , I 'm beginning to understand concepts that I 've been thinking about for months , years . You may find a solution here , if you try . No , this is over . We know what the outcome will be , I 'm talking about the future , about what 's possible . You 're just going to give up ? I 'm gonna face reality . This is reality ! No , this is futile . You are not the John Crichton I know . Zhaan . Look at what 's happened to me . How could I be ? I wonder if you can also see what you have lost . Your logic may be firm , but it is cold . But correct . When all the options have been exhausted , the John Crichton you know will reach the same conclusion . I get there quicker . That 's the only difference . And I know that you 'll get there , too . The reserve power unit 's completely burned out ! The defense screen was not made for this . Just give me whatever power you got . We 're feeding you as much as we can . I don 't wanna hear that , Aeryn . Well , we 're running out of options , Crichton . John ! We can 't keep re - doing this . D 'argo . I want you to know , if you have to get rid of one of the Crichtons , I 'm there for you . I appreciate the offer D 'argo , but I 'm not giving up yet . I understand . But I also want you to know , that if you don 't start facing reality soon , I 'm gonna face it for you ! Just give me some more time . Crichton ! D 'argo ! Just give me more time ! Now I want all the power you got . Transferring power ... The defense screen 's down to it 's last power cell ! It cannot be recharged while the screen is active ! You must do something , now ! It 's time . I know . Would you like me to take care of it ? Is that a yes ? How can you sound so calm ? You think I don 't feel for him ? Of course I do . But I 'm prepared to do what has to be done . Now would you like me to take care of it ? No . I 'll take care of it . John . Don 't feel bad . You knew this moment was coming . I appreciate you coming with me , D 'argo . I would not have you do it alone . Besides , I do not think it will go voluntarily . Looking for someone ? Where is he ? Hiding . Chiana . What ? You think I 'd just let you kill him ? I set him free . How could you have done this ? Frell you , D 'argo ! Where is he ? Somewhere you 'll never find . Do you know what you 've done ? We had a simple choice . Simple ! He dies , we live . Now we all die ! Moya dies ! We have two choices left . Two ? I 'm the one who 's supposed to be here ! You think I should go in there ? Yeah ? Well what about your bald headed friend ? He meant to be here too ? I tried to find another way . Oh yeah . I bet you did . Dammit Chiana , that is not fair ! Fair ? You think this guy is nothing ! He 's you ! He 's warm . He 's sensitive . He 's everything I ever liked about you . You take tiers one to three , I 'll take four to seven . Update , Pilot ! Remaining power cell down to fifteen percent ! The DRDs still report no sign of the other Crichton . I 've checked the rest of this tier . Then we 'll have to move on to the next one . Aeryn , I think it 's time we re - asses . I 'm guessing you 're not going to volunteer to go in the sphere . Correct . You 've seen what I can do , I can help this crew . What do you suggest I do now , turn around and start hunting Crichton ? It would make sense . To you , yes . But you don 't belong here . You 're a mistake . So you better pray we find the other one . Aeryn . Sorry . Rygel ! You stupid bony assed little bitch ! What were you thinking ? What was I thinking ? It was self preservation ! I thought you of all people would have understood that ! Even Crichton understood it ! What are you doing ? What do you think ? The first Crichton I see gets this in the back of the head . No way . Yeah ... We 're all gonna die if one of them doesn 't . No way ! Yes way ! And I don 't care which one it is ! Rygel ! It 's you 're doing Chiana ! Rygel ! How ? How did I know where to find you ? I knew where I 'd go if I wanted to hide . You know why I 'm here ? Sphere . Yeah . I 'm letting you go . Get out of here . Go ! Move it ! Crichton , I found 'im . Meet me in the maintenance bay . On my way . Where is he ? I let him go . I thought you would . John , you had your chance . And you blew it . You let your emotions get the better of ya . You couldn 't face reality . You wanna face ... reality ? Face reality ? We were saving ourselves at someone else 's expense ! Who wasn 't worth saving . Come on , Johnny . Don 't tell me you didn 't think that . I can see a part of you still thinks it . Remember the way you first saw the ape man ? How you could legitimize sacrificing him ? Well guess what ? That 's the way I see you . Tell me something . if I wasn 't here , you wouldn 't volunteer to go into the sphere , would ya ? Moya might emerge through the dimensional porthole unscathed , I 'll take that risk . Oh , yeah . Aren 't you special ? With an attitude like that , do you really think you 're the best of the three of us ? You know I am . Yeah , you 're fantastic . You 're gonna fit in great around here . The rest of the crew 's just gonna love ya . They will when they see what I can do for 'em . You just told me you 'd sell 'em down the river . Let 'em go through the porthole . I tell ya what ... You ever wanna know what it was like to have 'em for friends ? Just think back to when you were me . You 're very judgmental for someone who 's still hiding . No I 'm not . We 're out of time . Bet you didn 't guess that move . You 're very predictable . I prefer to think of it as ... reliable . You understand it has to be this way . I could never really be me with you still around . I 'd always be the outsider . Smarter , more capable . Yet not quite John . Can you understand how frustrating that would be ? You think you 're ever going to be anything but an outsider ? Better than dying . So you 're the future . I 'm glad I won 't be here to see it . Dead ? Yeah . Good . Hey . Hey , you don 't have to do that . Want to . Not my place . Don 't belong . Look , I don 't ... I don 't really belong here , either . Your time . Your place . My fate . I accept . I understand . I understand . Good luck . How 's Aeryn ? Well , she 's doing better than this defense screen . Actually , she 's doing better than you ... you look terrible . Oh , I 've had better days . You did what you thought was right , John . And I did what I knew was wrong . The future Crichton . Kinda makes you wonder if that 's where we 're headed . It 's only one possible genetic path . Yeah , but it 's possible . That 's the problem . I heard about what you did . You really offered to take the dive ? It took me awhile . And I needed some help . Well , for what it 's worth ... I 'm glad it worked out the way it did . I wish I could be . I always thought I was a good guy , Chiana . But it was the least developed one of me , the one I thought least likely , who did the right thing . Somehow you knew . I know you .

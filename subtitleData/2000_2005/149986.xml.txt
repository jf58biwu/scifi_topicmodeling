 T TURKiSO gururla sunar # TURK @ EFNET Mr. Taransky ... ? She 's ... She 's walking ? Don 't tell me she 's walking . She can 't walk . - N icola ! - This , this ... - not this . - N icola ! - How was your massage ? - You 're in breach . - Cigarette . - Is this about the new pages ? Be caus e I made the changes , all the changes you wanted . You are virtually in e v ery s cene . It is not the size of the role , Viktor . Am I , or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot ? H mm ? It 's the biggest on earth . I swear . It 's a 50-foot Airstream . The y don 't make them any longer . - Taller , Viktor . - Taller ? - Taller ! - What ? Eh . You 'v e insulted me for the last time . You 're right . It 's actually- - It 's actually taller . - You 're right . It 's amazing . - Coffee ! Wait a minute . The tires are ov erinflated . See ? It 's just this . See ? Look . H ere . - The air comes right out . - This is sad . See ? It 's lower already . N icola , I beg you . Don 't do this to me . You know , I had three other offers . I only signed on to this picture ... - out of loyalty . - Well , then show me some . The y 're going to shut me down ! It 's not working , Viktor . I mean , my God ! The s cene with the thousand gees e ? ! I don 't understand this film ! Nobody is going to understand this film . I already put out a press releas e citing creativ e differences . So just let it go . You went to the press ? Do we hav e e v erything ? All right . You know what ? You 're right . You are right . And when you 're right , you 're right . - Thank you . - Let me help you with thes e . 'Caus e you oughta go . - I don 't des erv e you . - Oh . This film doesn 't des erv e you . It des erv es much , much better than you ! Creativ e differences ? The difference is you 're not creativ e . To hell , pleas e . Jack ? Jack , are you there ? She 's good . You can hardly tell she 's reading off a teleprompter . I 'm right here . Right beside you . Look . I 'v e analyzed this footage . We 'v e got e v erything we need in the can already . If I could just make the proper adjustments , we can finish this film without her . Viktor , according to the writ her attorne ys filed at noon today , the y 'll sue if the film is releas ed with N icola in a single frame . The y will sue , Viktor . The y 're s erious . So let 's re cast . N icola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part . - It 's a remake , Hal . - That 's right . N icola Anders is not bigger than this picture . Of cours e she is , Viktor . No other name is going to sign on now . Who needs a name ? We 'll cast an unknown . I 'm not going to play opposite an unknown . - We can 't s ell an unknown . - The numbers don 't work . If we e v er want to be in the N icola Anders business again , we hav e to cut our loss es and shelv e the picture . No ! I will not giv e in to that blackmailing- - Viktor , let 's take a walk . Ridiculous performance . I told you she was bad . No , yours in there . Why do you always hav e to make things so difficult for yours elf ? Difficult ? I 'm being difficult ? Yes . Mm-hmm . Elaine , do you know what thes e are ? Mike ' n ' Ike 's ? The y 're not just any Mike ' n ' Ike 's , Thes e are cherry Mike ' n ' Ike 's . Do you know why I , Viktor Taransky , two-time Academy Award nominated dire ctor- - Viktor , that was " Short Subje ct . " - -ov ers eeing the most cherished movie proje ct of my entire career , am walking around with- - look , look , look ... pockets full of thes e ... things ? ! I hav e a feeling you 're going to tell me . I 'm going to tell you why . Be caus e Ms. N icola Anders , supermodel with a SAG card , has it written in her contract that all cherry Mike ' n ' Ike 's be remov ed from her candy dish , along with strict instructions that any room she walks into must hav e s e v en packs of cigarettes waiting for her- - three of them opened ; that there be a personal Jacuzzi within 80 paces of her dressing room ; and that any time she trav els , her nanny must fly with her first-class . So , what 's wrong with that ? Elaine , she doesn 't hav e children . Don 't you s ee ? The y 're mocking us . The y 're mocking- - we 're at their mercy . What happened ? I mean , we always had movie stars , but the y us ed to be our stars , remember ? We were the ones who would tell them what to do . And we would tell them what to wear , - who to date- - - That 's what you want ? ! When the y were under contract to us , we could change their names if we wanted to . - More than once . - Viktor , do you realize you 're nostalgic for an era you weren 't e v en born in ? ! I do remember why I got into this business . - You s eem to hav e forgotten . - Oh , pleas e . Come on . N ew York- - Cassav etes . Remember ? - H ere we go . - What were we doing ? We were trying to make something important . I don 't know . Shine a little light in that darkened cinema . It 's called a proje ctor . Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth . I thought that 's what we were doing . I hav e good memories of thos e days , too . I do , but this isn 't about that- - or you , or me , or some high-minded ideal . This is business . - Spare me . - Look around . Who do you think pays for all of this ? This is about inv estment and return . I 'm not interested in inv estment and return ! I 'm not interested in who pays for anything ! I 'm trying to make a movie ! I 'm responsible for this , Viktor . Thos e days in N ew York ... It 's ov er , Viktor . You 're not renewing my contract ? How can I ? ! Your last three pictures tanked . No bankable star is going to work with you after this . I mean , if you just compromis ed a little . Well , it 's not e v ery day you 're fired by the mother of your own child . You and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old time 's sake . And so you could still hold your head up in front of Laine y . - I fought for you . - Yeah , well ... I 'm sorry , Viktor . Dad ! - Sweetheart . - H e y , Dad . - How are you , hone y ? - Good . I 'm sorry Mom canned you . I 'm going to finish this picture . Laine y , I 'm going to finish it . Be caus e it 's important . I know you will , Dad . You 're Viktor Taransky . I 'm Viktor Taransky . 'Kay . By e , Dad . - H i , sweetheart . - H e y , Mom . Are you okay ? I 'm Viktor Taransky . Mr. Taransky ? Mr. Taransky , thank God . I 'v e been trying to s ee you . I 'v e been calling . Your assistant won 't put me through . I told her it was a matter of life and death . I was afraid I wasn 't going to get to you in time . Pleas e , just ... - Keep your distance . - I did it ! I did it ! I licked skin , I licked hair , - I licked e v ery part of her . - I 'm going to call s e curity . I 'll call s e curity if you don 't back off . I hav e her , Mr. Taransky . The answer to your pray ers . - The answer to this . - I was misquoted . I hav e your new leading-lady right here . In my pants . Pleas e , sir , I don 't know you . - I don 't know where you come from- - - It 's me ! Mr. Taransky , don 't- - Don 't you re cognize me ? The Future of Film Conference in San Jos e . Remember that ? Hank . Hank Aleno . I was a ke ynote speaker . You must remember my spee ch . - " Who N eeds H umans ? " - Right . You were booed off the stage . - Whoa , that 's got to be ... - Eight y ears ago . And that whole time I ne v er left my computer . U h-huh . Good for you , Hank . Well , it 's good and bad . That 's what caus ed this . The e y e tumor . - Microwav es from the s creen . - I 'm sorry . Don 't be , be caus e it was worth it . You hav e to s ee her . Oh , I 'v e s een thos e . - No t ll ke thi s . - I 'll take care o f that . Yeah , well , yo u 're talki ng abo ut a " syn-thespl an . " - A I rtual acto r . - No , we call the m " ac-to rs . " " Vac-tors " ? I need flesh . - Flesh is weak . - It can 't be done . It can be done . With my new computer code , it can be done . You and me ... we can do this together . I don 't know anything about computers . See , that 's why- - that 's why you 're so perfe ct . You hav e something ... - that I don 't hav e . - What 's that ? An e y e . An e y e for performance . You know the truth when you s ee it . I know . I mean , I 'v e s een your movies . I lov e your movies . - You lov e my movies ? - " Straw God . " That changed my life . You saw " Straw God " ? I hav e s een e v ery frame of your work . You 're the only filmmaker with the artistic integrity ... to realize my vision . You and me , art and s cience- - We 're the perfe ct marriage . Hank ... I 'v e had a rough day today . But , I tell you what , I 'll call you about this next week . - We can talk . - I won 't be here in a week . - The tumor is inoperable . - I 'll call you about it , okay ? That 's what I 'm trying to say . The tumor is inoperable . I 'll be dead . Well , I 'm already dead . Call me ! This week ! Pleas e . What do you mean she won 't work with me ? She 's done nothing . She doesn 't hav e a single credit to her name . Better no credits than a Taransky credit . Art , you don 't understand . I 'v e mortgaged e v erything to finish this film . The creditors are calling me . The y 're at the door for God 's sake . H ello ? Damn it ! Mr. Taransky . Mr. Taransky ! - Mr. Taransky ! - No , I 'm not him ! - Mr. Taransky ! - I 'm not him ! Mr. Taransky ! Hank Aleno ! I repres ent the estate of Mr. Hank Aleno . It was his last wish that you hav e this . What is it ? I hav e no idea . H e wanted you to hav e it . Valarie ! Valarie ! Valarie ! Valarie , what are you running from ? From Valarie . Valarl e , no ! Jack , are you there ? Something like this can happen and what ... was it for ? Why are we here ? Is that what you 're asking , Jack ? Why are we here ? No why ... just here . Just here . Ladies and gentlemen of the jury , I know I may be guilty of a crime , but it was committed with the purest of intentions . I wanted to s end a message to the acting community who ... put thems elv es abov e the work , who put thems elv es abov e me . So , what did you guys think ? So fake . Totally artificial . Like we 're suppos e to belie v e that was 1 9th century Lisbon . - Come on . - Guys ... Who 's looking at the s ets when she 's on s creen ? Oh , y eah . There he is . That 's my dad , Viktor Taransky . - She was magnificent . - She 's absolutely unreal . Breathtaking . She wasn 't too ... cartoony , or anything ? The nun ? Or are you talking about the mother ? A star like that , who cares about the supporting cast ? Congratulations again . She 's not of this earth . - You should be v ery proud . - Oh , not of this earth . And the rest of the film , what did you think ? She 's a miracle . Where did you find her ? Well ... I saw her picture ... on the computer . A computer ? You really didn 't notice anything unusual about her ? Only her brilliance . To be honest , with what you had to work with , I was expe cting a train wre ck . - You really pulled it off . - I did ? Yeah . I hav e a feeling Mom 's going to take you back after this . Back on the lot . That 's what- - I know . I know . Come on , let 's go . A dazzll ng new l ng enue has co me fro m see ml ng ly no where to capture the hearts o f mo l e-g o l ng audi ences aro und the wo rld to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world in her debut film " Sunris e , Suns et . " But who is Simone ? We know so little about her . And why the s e cre cy ? All we know for sure is that she was dis cov ered by little-known dire ctor , Viktor Tarinsky . Taransky . Simone ! Simone ? - Good to s ee you , too , Elaine . - Where is she ? - She 's not here . - Why isn 't she with you ? Why ? Be caus e she would ne v er come to something like this . She 's intens ely priv ate . Back to work , e v eryone . She 's not here . H e y , listen . Hav e you read the re views ? The y 're lov e letters . Listen to this one . Oh , here . Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda , the body of Sophia Loren , the grace of well , Grace Kelly- - ha-ha- - and the face ... of Audre y H epburn combined with an angel . - Almost right . - I can 't wait to meet her . Oh , I don 't know if that 's going to happen . Why not ? She is somewhat of a re clus e . That 's how she stays so pure . She isolates hers elf in her art . Viktor , it 's my studio . Elaine , it 's my actor . There are other studios . There 's only one Simone . Okay , hav e it your way , Viktor . H ello , Walter . Nobody came in or went out , - just like you said . - Very good . - Mr. Taransky ? - Yes ? Is Ms. Simone coming in today ? She 's already here . She arriv ed before you got here . She 's going to leav e long after you 're gone . Remember , under no circumstances are you or anybody els e e v er to enter this s et without my express permission , understood ? Yes , sir . Mr. Taransky ? What if it catches on fire ? Let it burn . Good morning , Simone . Good morning , Mr. Taransky . Simone , a star is ... digitized . Do you know what this means ? We hav e stepped into a new dimension . Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to dete ct it . I am the death of real . ... death of real . ... death of real . Too much Meryl Streep . A little less Streep . And a little more ... Bacall . Is this better , Mr. Taransky ? Much . While we 're at it , there 's a little something I want to add to your repertoire . You 'v e got the wrong Holly Golightly . Remember that thing Audre y H epburn does in " Breakfast at Tiffany 's " ? How do I look ? Giv e me Audre y . How do I look ? Perfe ct . Perfe ct , Simone . Perfe ct . Oh , God . I 'm so relaxed around you . I 'm so mys elf . You did create me . I just brought someone els e 's dream to life . Mr. Taransky , we both know I was nothing without you . I was computer code . I was ones and zeros . I was nothing . Well ... that 's true . I don 't want to boast , but ... Are you e v er going to tell the truth about me , Mr. Taransky ? I 'm going tell the truth about you . Why wouldn 't i ? Of cours e ... with Hank 's tragic passing , his s e cret did die with him . This is a classic cas e of te chnology in s earch of an artist . Someone with integrity , someone with vision , someone who can s ee . See be yond this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood . Someone who can s ee that with the ris e in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake , that the s cales hav e tipped- - naturally in favor of the fake . Someone who can s ee that if a performance is genuine , it doesn 't matter if the actor 's real or not . And what 's real anymore ? Most actors thes e days hav e digital work done to them . It 's a gray area . The only real truth is the work . I 'm going to tell the truth about you after your next picture . You 're so beautiful . You 're too beautiful . We 're going to fix that . Is this on ? I will not be taking any questions regarding Simone . I do , howe v er , hav e a statement to read on her behalf . " To Whom it May Concern : I 'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public respons e to Mr. Taransky 's film . At this time I will be conducting no interviews , or making publicity appearances- - - This is unbelie v able . - I politely request that the press respe ct my priv acy and let the work speak for its elf . Yours truly , Simone . " Viktor ! Who is Simone dating ? ! Where did you find her ? - Is Simone her real name ? - Didn 't I make it clear ? No questions regarding Simone . We 're just trying to get some answers . I will make my final statement . Ms. Simone begins production on her new film today- - " Eternity Fore v er . " This is a proje ct which has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine y ears ago . Thank you . Would you answer a question regarding Hank ? Hank ? Who asked me about Hank ? Funny , why is the movie dedicated to Hank ? Are the y involv ed ? The y were at one time ins eparable . Yes . And now ? Now ... sadly to say , only in spirit . Thank you . Your car will be ready in just a minute . We gav e you a complimentary car wash . - Oh , really ? - The y 're cleaning the engine now . Thank you . - Viktor , he y . - Hal . I am so happy for us . The film , the chemistry . Nothing against N icola Anders , but I think that Simone and I , we really worked great together . - You were ne v er together . - Still , the conne ction was undeniable . You can 't- - Look , I hav e not read " Eternity Fore v er , " but it is fantastic . And I know I would be perfe ct for the part of Cliv e . - Clyde . - Clyde , right . That 's what I 'm talking about . Yes , perfe ct . Come on , man . Look , I ran into Simone on the lot . - Really ? - Yes , really . - She ne v er mentioned it . - She 's bus y right now . People coming at her from all angles . Maybe she didn 't want you to know , huh ? I strongly s ens ed that she thought I would be perfe ct for Clyde as well . - Really ? - Strongly . Excus e me . Sure . H ello ? Simone , it 's so great to hear from you . How are you , sweetheart ? You 'll ne v er guess who I 'm with . - You met him on the lot the other day . - It was more in passing . No , you 're not e v en clos e . Hal . - Hal Sinclair . - What 's wrong now ? I 'm getting nothing from her side of the conv ersation . No , I don 't think he put on weight . Anyway , listen . Do you think he 'd be right for " Eternity Fore v er " ? H e 's not the right type ? You want to go in another dire ction ? Well ... we 'll try and talk her into it , don 't worry . Anything you can do . - Anything . - Yeah , listen , hone y . What is this , some kind of jamming de vice ? This is a bad place to talk . Maybe he 's just talking to hims elf . Taransky 's not that good an actor . Hone y , I know you want to do charity work . No , the y 'v e taken spe cial pre cautions . Some kind of new encryption . Why would the y do that ? Well , whate v er it is ... it 's dark . Dark ? Yeah . Very . All right , we 'll talk about it at the beach hous e this weekend . - Can you e v er stop doing that ? - Why ? You 'll los e yours elf in that thing . You gotta get out more . How you gonna meet boys ? Dad , I know plenty of boys . You do ? Who ? Where do you meet them ? You meet them in thos e chat rooms ? How do you know you 're not talking to some middle-aged freak ? Dad , I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away . It 's beautiful today . Let 's go outside and eat . And Laine y , leav e the computer , pleas e . Okay . Dad , it might be better to eat inside . Stay here . What is this ? What the hell is going on ? What are you doing here ? - You 're trespassing . - You can 't hide her fore v er ! Simone appears only when I want her to appear ! Sounds like a prisoner . - What are you , holding her hostage ? - You 're the hostage . I mean , you look kind of captiv e to me . Laine y , don 't you e v er wonder where I 'm really hiding Simone ? Just as long as I know where you are , Dad . - By e , Dad . - By e , hone y . H ello , Viktor . Sorry I got her back late . Oh , no problem . H e y , you want to come in ? - H i . - H i , Hone y . - H i , Vik . - Kent . Viktor , we simply hav e to dis cuss " Eternity Fore v er . " I still hav en 't re ceiv ed Simone 's s cript notes . There aren 't any . If the filmmakers are happy , she 's happy . She considers hers elf , you know , an instrument . So she 's really going to do all this nudity ? It 's on the page . We hav e to do something about this budget . It 's completely unrealistic . You allowed nothing for limousine s ervice . - She driv es hers elf . - U h-huh . - Hair and make-up ? - Does her own . - Theater training . - Oh , she was in the theater ? Where ? You want her resume ? I 'll s end it to you . Okay , great . Thanks . At least , Viktor , contingency for wardrobe . Anybody can go up a size . I guarantee she will not gain an ounce . She is so dis ciplined . Well , we 'v e gotta do something about this- " Stuntwoman . " - What about it ? - Well , there isn 't one . - She doesn 't need one . - Does all her own stunts . - E v en the fall from the plane ? - E v en the fall from the plane . - Oh . Shoot it on the last day . Listen , Viktor . I want to talk to you now , not as Elaine , Studio H ead , but as Elaine , ex-wife . H e y , s e cond ex-wife . Seriously . You got lucky this last time . But you need to be careful . We both know you wouldn 't be making this ov erblown art film if you hadn 't convinced Simone to be in it . Elaine ... talking to you now , not as Viktor , Dire ctor , but as Viktor , your first former husband , what happened to you ? H uh ? Experience , Viktor . That 's what happened to me . Yeah , I 'v e s een this a hundred times . - Really ? - Yeah . Thes e young stars destroying the v ery people who dis cov ered them . I 'm worried about you , that 's all . This woman , she controls your destiny . She doesn 't control my destiny . There 's something about her I don 't trust . H i , Jane . Thanks for taking me back , Mr. Taransky . I know that it looked like I sided with the studio , but I 'v e always belie v ed in you . Honestly . Don 't worry . I understand . - Are the y- - - The y 're all here . Okay , thank you . H ello . Viktor . I just want to say I am delighted to hav e such a wonderful cast ass embled here for " Eternity Fore v er . " A reminder : as a condition for working on this picture , you will not be rehearsing with Simone . You will not be shooting with Simone . Actually , you are forbidden from contacting Simone at any time , for any reason , whatsoe v er . - Works for me . - How will you shoot our lov e s cenes ? - Body double . - For her ? For you . Anyway , Simone insisted on speaking with you hers elf before filming started . I belie v e she 's on the line now . Simone , are you there ? I certainly am , Mr. Taransky . So are we , Simone . Why don 't you leav e me alone with my co-stars , Mr. Taransky , so we can get to know each other better ? Absolutely . I 'll be back in a minute . H i , who 's there ? Don 't be shy . Introduce yours elv es . I 'm Mac . I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here . H i , Simone . I 'm Corel . H i , I 'm Claris . You us ed to date my cousin , Dell . I 'm H ewlitt . We can rehears e in priv ate if you like . My name is Lotus . God , I can 't belie v e I 'm talking to you . We are going to be come such great friends . H i , Simone , it 's Hal . It 's great to be working together ... again . Is that e v eryone ? Well , ob viously , as you know , I 'm Simone . Who els e ? I just want to start by apologizing for my process . I know it 's an unusual way to work , but I just find I relate better to people when the y 're not actually there . Oh , of cours e . Of cours e . I don 't hav e much to say , Except , that I know it 's gonna be a great proje ct if we all just trust Mr. Taransky 's vision . Always do what Mr. Taransky says . If in doub t , do it the Taransky way . I know we 're gonna make a wonderful movie together . Together . Absolutely . Veronica . What you don 't understand , Clyde , is that lov e- - Still too big . I like it , but it 's too big . All right . Smaller teardrops this time . What you don 't understand , Clyde , is that lov e is like a wildflower . But that flower only grows on the edge ... of a v ery high cliff . Perfe ct . Perfe ct . Sl mo ne . Sl mo ne . Sl mo ne . Gonna be a little change in plans , Simone . You hav e no idea the effe ct your performance is having on people . We can 't stop now . Thes e films , the y 're speaking to the human condition . We 're changing liv es . People need to belie v e you 're real . To re v eal the truth now , it would be too cruel . You 're gonna get in a lot of trouble , Mr. Taransky . Now , why do you hav e to bring that up ? ! I mean , e v erything 's a risk . But it 's worth it , isn 't it ? We 'v e done enough work today . You 'v e been cooped up in there too long . So how about ... you and I going out on the town ? Tonight , the y 're going to s ee you with their own e y es . Excus e me . I will be che cking in a v ery spe cial guest . - A Ms. Enomis . - Ah , Ms. Enomis . Now , Ms. Enomis demands her priv acy . So , you will switch off all surv eillance cameras . I alone , will es cort Ms. Enomis to her room via the rear exit . She must not be disturbed at any time , for any reason whatsoe v er . I 'm sure I can rely on your dis cretion . U nderstood , sir . Thank you . There she is ! Who is it ? It 's Simone . Okay , I think e v erybody 's here . Now ! I think we 're all right now . Oh , thank God for you , Faith . Thank God for you . This is way abov e and be yond the call of duty for a stand-in . I must tell you , you hav e no idea the s ervice you 'v e performed for Simone , shielding her from thes e animals . Oh , no , Mr. Taransky . Thank God for you . - For me ? - Yeah . How many dire ctors would go to so much trouble to prote ct an actress ? It 's incredible . You know , we 're gonna hav e to go back to my place , just to , you know , keep them off the s cent . Of cours e . You look so ... So much like ... um , like her ? Oh , y es , of cours e . Like her . But you 're so v ery beautiful in your own right . I do find mys elf strangely attracted to you , Mr. Taransky . Call me Viktor . Viktor . - Oh . - Oh , Viktor . - Viktor . - Yes ? - This is so exciting . - Yes . Do what you do to Simone ? What ? What did you say ? I said do whate v er you do to Simone . What I do to Simone ? Call me Simone ! Simone ? Yes . Say it again , pleas e . I want to know what it 's like to be her just for one night . Pleas e , call me Simone . You 're with me so you can be clos e to her ? Is that a problem ? Okay . Excus e me just a minute . Is something wrong ? Well , actually , maybe we can do this some other time - or something . - Are you bus y tomorrow ? Gentlemen , the Presidential Suite . Ahem- - I think that should take care of e v erything . Yes , sir . I belie v e it will . Leav e me for a moment . Simone . - Brilliant . - Elaine ! - There she is . - The picture- - The picture . It 's a re v elation . Thank you . Thank you . We all worked so hard . - It was you . - No , it was all of us . It was incredible . Thank you all . Thank you . - Whoa ! - Viktor ! - Is she here ? - Viktor , is she here ? Oh , I 'm fine , Hal . How are you ? Somebody said she was here . Jesus . That 's her glass . Jack Daniels , straight up . - My kind of woman . - Come on , where is she ? I don 't know . She 's , uh ... Is that her by the fountain ? You know , between you and me , - she doesn 't really exist . - Simone ! - Simone ! - Simone 's here ? - Why didn 't anybody tell me ? - She 's here ? ! - Simone ! - I got your glass ! I 'm your biggest fan ! Simone ! - Simone ! - Simone ? Get out ! Not you two . She goes to a major Hollywood A-list party and we don 't get an interview , a comment ? We don 't e v en get a photograph ? ! Is that what you 're telling me ? Nobody got a photograph . Nobody e v er gets a photograph . We hav e our best people on it , Mr. Say er . Get better people ! What about the 2 4-hour tail on Taransky ? The y 're camped out e v ery place he goes ; e v ery concierge , e v ery maitre d ' , the y 're all on the take . But this Simone woman is good . Ob viously , that is not her real name . She us es an assumed identity . She trav els under a fals e name . She che cks into a hotel under an alias . N e v er stays in the same place two nights in a row . What about the satellite photos ? What happened ? - Nothin ' . - Nothing from space ? ! What about the fingerprints ? What happened when we dusted that whole hotel suite ? Well , we hav e some of Taransky 's fingerprints , a lot of yours ... and none of hers . No one is that perfe ct , that pure . You know , I had something on Mother Teresa once . But then she died and it just wasn 't worth it anymore . I know how to flush out this Simone woman . A tell-all story from her childhood . You hav e one ? I will when you 're finished writing it . Pleas e don 't make me do this . Guard , open this door right now . Mr. Taransky gav e me spe cific instructions ne v er to open up this door . - What are you doing ? ! - Mr. Taransky ! - Why did you do this ? ! - We hav e to talk to her ! - We know she 's in there . - Okay . What is this about ? We 'v e got the tracking numbers for " Eternity Fore v er . " The y 're in the toilet . She 's gotta get out there and s ell the film . What do you want her to do , go door-to-door ? E v en Garbo would be on the talk show circuit if she were aliv e ! It is pre cis ely be caus e she doesn 't crav e the limelight that people lov e her ! - This is bullshit ! - She is about the work , - and only the work ! - This is ov ershadowing the work . If you can 't handle her , I will . It 's not a good time . She 's emotional . Today , her mother dies . Scene 4 2 of " Good for Nothing . " - This is not a good time . - It ne v er is . - Step aside ! - We 're going in ! - This is ridiculous ! - No ! No ! - What are you doing ? ! - Simone ! I trusted you . - Simone ? - You can come out , it 's Elaine ! - We just want to hav e a meeting . - We can talk , - girl-to-girl . Just us . - Where is she ? - She 's gone . - Where are the s ets ? - God , that is so like her . - Where are the cameras ? Viktor , we 're not paying for this are we ? What is all this ? What is all this ? Well ... I suppos e it was gonna come out sooner or later . I guess I 'm actually relie v ed in a way . I can just say it finally . She 's a computer- - addict . What ? She 's a computer addict ! She 's buried in here . Day in , day out . Of cours e . I should hav e guess ed . It 's why she ne v er goes anywhere , - Why she 's ne v er s een in public . - Now you 're getting it . Probably spends her whole life in chat rooms . - The one place she can be hers elf . - Anonymous . Only it 's wors e . It 's far wors e . She 's extremely agoraphobic . She has a morbid fear of people , of germs , places , heights- - - Name it . - This is terrible . How is she going to plug the film ? - Yes , indeed . - She has to do publicity . Maybe I could get her to do something . Maybe a tele vision talk show or something . Yes ! - Taped . - Make it liv e , pleas e . - Liv e ? - Pleas e . She 'd ne v er go there . It would hav e to be remote . We can work with that . I can 't promis e anything . - We understand . - Thank you , Viktor . - Thank you , Viktor . - Don 't grov el . Thank you . Giv e her our best . That agoraphobia- - it 's like a plague . It 's out of control in Europe . It 's so good of you to prote ct her like this . She wanted you- - No , no . Don 't touch that . Germs . She wanted you to hav e that . She was there . She was right there . Yeah . Oh , my gosh . She didn 't , by any chance , happen to mention me ? Actually , she did . She , uh ... she said that she thought you were v ery beautiful . - Really ? - Yeah . Would you want to go and get something to eat , or something ? Viktor , I 'd lov e to , really . , but don 't you hav e to go talk to Simone ? If I can find her . Well . All right . Good . - Thanks , Viktor . - Thank you . I 'm gonna- - By e . Tonight , on Frank Brand Liv e- - Since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie , " Sunris e , Suns et , " no one has managed to land a liv e tele vision interview with this fabulous shooting starlet , Simone- - until now . she 's agreed to talk with us tonight from the s et of her new film . Welcome , Simone . So glad you can find time in your he ctic s chedule to be here . It 's my pleasure . Wonderful to be with you , Frank . No one can accus e you of being ov erexpos ed , Simone . Why hav e you stay ed so completely out of the limelight ? I guess I just think actors talk too much . Does the world really want to hear my life story just be caus e I hav e a movie opening on Friday ? Wow . She is all woman . Of cours e , the problem with shying away from publicity thes e days is that it tends to attract e v en more . Don 't I know it . But the only reason I 'm here now , is to put the attention back where it belongs , on Mr. Taransky 's film . And you don 't s e cretly want the attention ? I 'm not e v en sure I des erv e it . You s ee , after tonight , I 'll hav e just as much s creen time on your show as I hav e in my movies . Now , how is that healthy for a performer ? Be caus e you hav e to understand , Frank , none of this is real . Who I am on s creen and who I really am , the y 're two totally different people . Change of topic . You hav e been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press- - Mick Jagger , Ste v en Hawking , Fidel Castro , most re cently , Viktor Taransky . Is there a Mr. Right in there somewhere ? You know , Frank , I 'd rather not dis cuss my priv ate life . But Viktor and I , we are ins eparable . Oh , Viktor . You dog . I wouldn 't be here today without him . Would you like a moment , Simone ? No , I 'm okay . Okay . Then let 's talk about this work you care so much about . Sure . Where would you like to start , Frank ? - How about the nudity ? - I know where that is . N udity 's just ne v er been an issue for me . I know that tree . - Clothes are simply an option . - I know that tree . I know where that is . What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two proje cts ? I suppos e what I like most about the movies I 'm in is that the y 're not about spe cial effe cts . And the y are better for it , I might add . We appear to be having some satellite difficulties . But , before we los e you completely , Simone , I just want to say thank you . Thank you , Frank . Goodby e . Ladies and gentlemen , Simone . I 'v e been here before . On my hone ymoon with my ex-wife . Yeah , look . It 's the exact same tree . And look in the distance . The mountain . It 's a hotel . I don 't understand . Could the y hav e built that hotel since y esterday ? Get in the car . Simone ! Simone ! We don 't do the photos , you don 't get the cov er . It 's as simple as that . Yes . Written answers to written questions . Didn 't we hav e this conv ersation before ? Yeah , web site interviews , no problem . I think people are gonna lov e " Eternity Fore v er . " " Eternity Fore v er " is my finest work . I lov ed working with the dire ctor of " Eternity Fore v er . " H e 's a genius . You wish . It 's wonderful being a movie star . But there 's so many other ways I want to express mys elf . But it 's not enough to be a movie star . You hav e to be a pop star , too . If you really want to make a difference . N ice boat , Taransky ! It 's not a boat , it 's a yacht . I know what you 're up to . You know , I really don 't hav e time for this . I think you do , 'caus e I know it 's a fake . It 's bogus . You us ed an old library shot for the background . She ne v er was in N ew Mexico . She ne v er e v en left the studio . I 'v e done my homework . - I 'v e studied her . - I bet you hav e . I 'v e looked at e v ery pie ce of publicity she 's done . And as far as I can tell , there 's no e vidence that she has e v er left the studio . Oh ... And for some reason , this woman leav es no paper trail ? Now , I 'v e ob tained a copy of your bank account . I know you hav e power of attorne y , but so far , you hav e not turned ov er a single solitary cent to this woman . I keep it in a trust . I know that 's what you want people to belie v e , but I gotta tell you , embezzlement is a s erious matter . Not to mention abduction . - Abduction ? - Yeah . Off the re cord . I want to know how you 're doing it . Is it drugs ? Is it mind control ? Is it blackmail ? Is it all three ? What do you do ? Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere ? What is it exactly that you want ? I want to s ee her . U nless you show me Simone liv e and in person , I show thes e photos to the authorities . You want to s ee her ? All right . You 'v e got a deal . You want to s ee her ? You 're gonna s ee her ! Good ! Mr. Taransky . - H ello , gentlemen . - We 're all ready . This time tomorrow night , she 'll be standing right here in front of 1 00,000 people . We could 'v e sold this out 20 times . Yeah , the sound che ck went great . The las er show is good to go . I gotta ask you , though , you ordered an awful lot of smoke . Well , that 's the way she wants it . After you told us about the death threats , s e curity guards are under strict instructions ne v er to take their e y es off the crowd . Excellent . H ere , Simone wanted you to hav e thes e . - U nreal . - And remember- - no cameras , no binoculars . Ladies and gentlemen , Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to pres ent Simone- - liv e on stage for the debut concert of the Splendid Isolation tour . Let 's get you into hair and make-up . No . No . Yes . You know , it 's easier to make 1 00,000 belie v e than just one ? And now , the one , the only , Simone ! I lov e you ... LA . It 's great to be here . Looking out On the morning rain I us ed to feel so inspired And when I knew I had to face another day Lord , it made me feel so tired Before the day I met you Life was so unkind But you 're the ke y to my peace of mind 'Caus e you make me feel You make me feel You make me feel like a natural woman Oh , baby What you 'v e done to me Done to me You make me feel so good inside Good inside And I just wanna be Wanna be Clos e to you , you make me feel so aliv e 'Caus e you make me feel You make me feel You make me feel like a natural woman You make me feel - You make me feel - You make me feel You make me feel You make me feel like a real ... You make me feel Feel like a ... You make me feel like a real ... Thank you . N e v er stop belie ving . Yeah ! Simone ! What you 'v e done to me Natural woman . I said I didn 't want to be disturbed ! Viktor . My two favorite girls in all the world . We just stopped by to congratulate Simone . Well , you know ... she 's lying down . She 's exhausted . Yeah , I can imagine . Listen , thank Simone for the tickets , okay ? That 's a good color on you . It was a great show , Dad . I can 't belie v e she 's doing this . Taking adv antage of him this way . - It 's cruel . - Why ? Ob viously , this can 't last . She 's gonna dump him . Viktor won 't be able to take that , he 's too s ensitiv e . This 'll destroy him . Elaine , do you realize that you can 't stop talking about Viktor ? I hav e to talk to her . I 'v e been meaning to talk to you . I 'm starting to feel like I don 't exist . Dad ? Oh , hi , baby . Thank you . So how 's your lov e life ? I do okay . What about you ? Well , you know me . Married to my work . I noticed . You know I don 't like to get between you and mom , but she 's feeling down right now . She broke up with Kent . She thinks you 're with Simone . Ah , Laine y . That 's so ridiculous . I don 't hav e a relationship with Simone . I know , I know , but Mom doesn 't . Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out . Dinner maybe . Dinner ? I don 't know about dinner . That 'd be difficult , I think . - Maybe a phone call ? - It 's too impersonal . The y hav e to meet face-to-face . Well , I 'll think of something . The es calating violence , tragic loss of human life , and threat of all-out war was ov ershadowed today by the announcement of the Os car nominations . - H ello ? - H ello ? - Is this Elaine ? - Who 's this ? - Oh my God . Is that you , Simone ? - Yes . - You look beautiful today . - Thanks , I- - - Where are you ? - I 'm right here . Beside you . - Oh ! - I borrowed Viktor 's car . - H i ! - H i . I 'm really late . I would lov e to talk to you , But I 'm on my way to s ee Viktor right now . Simone , I know what 's going on between you two . Oh ? No . Oh , Elaine , there 's absolutely nothing . It 's strictly a working relationship . I just don 't want to s ee Viktor get hurt . Sounds to me like you still hav e feelings for him . Well , we hav e a daughter together . I don 't lov e Viktor . I could ne v er lov e anyone . I 'm in lov e with the camera . Simone , I re cognize the coat you 're wearing . I gav e it to Viktor on his birthday . Christ . Elaine , I just- - Whoa . God ! Oh my God ! I tell ya . - Are you all right ? - This does look awful . I know that . But , Viktor , he 's just so crazy about you . Could you go to the Os cars with him ? No , no , no . If you won 't do it for him , I ask you , pleas e , do it for me . Okay . Okay . For you . For you I 'll go . Thank you . Well , here 's my exit . All right . I 'm glad that we talked . - Oh , y es . By e . - By e ! Goodby e . Oh ! And , the wl nner o f BYest Actress ... I s ... Oh , my goodness . We hav e a tie . The winners are Simone for " Sunris e , Suns et " ... Thank you . ... and Simone for " Eternity Fore v er . " U nfortunately , Simone cannot be with us here tonight but thanks to the miracle of modern te chnology , she joins us liv e from her Goodwill Tour of the third world . Ladies and gentlemen , Simone ! Thank you . Oh , thank you . This means so much to me . I 'm just sorry I couldn 't be there with you . First , I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees . I don 't e v en feel I belong in the Best Actress category , let alone with thes e wonderful human beings . And I also wanna thank my co-stars and the studio , of cours e . And as always , I dedicate this to Hank , without whom none of this would be possible . I lov e you , Hank , where v er you are . Thank you . Who 's Hank ? H er agent ? - H er father . - Oh . Why didn 't she thank you ? She did . Didn 't she ? No . And of cours e , I must thank my collaborator , Viktor Taransky , without whom none of this would be possible . And of cours e , I must thank my collaborator , Viktor Taransky , without whom none of this would be possible . Why didn 't I say it ? How could I forget to say it ? I wrote it . And of cours e , I must thank my collaborator , Viktor Taransky , wltho ut who m no ne o f thi s wo uld be po ssl ble . Excuse me , lM r . Taransky , Are you ready for your casting s ession ? N icola is here for the role of Simone 's sister . Viktor . So much has happened since we last saw each other . Oh , y eah . Yeah . - Why don 't you sit ? - Thank you . I ne v er got a chance to properly apologize for what happened on " Sunris e . " Oh , that 's okay . I know . I understand . When I saw what Simone did with the role , I mean , I fired all my people . I went into rehab . I took some acting class es . I changed my whole look . She really , really inspired me . Would you like me to read ? Oh , sure . That would be good . Who do you think you are , Carlos , coming in here like this ? My husband 's sleeping in the next room . You think I won 't call out ? Do you think I 'll just ... giv e in to you without a fight , like I did the last time and the time before that ? I wish you were dead . I wish we were both dead . Oh ... that was just wonderful . Wonderful acting . Thank you . You could play the lead . Isn 't that Simone 's part ? Of cours e . Of cours e it is . You hav e such a beautiful line , right , right there . It 's not a wrinkle , or anything , it 's like a dimple . Right- - when you smile it- - I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone . Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me ? Oh , y eah . That would be crazy . That would be crazy . Yes ... that would be nuts . Would you like me to try something different with this , or do it again ? No , it 's fine . Okay . Thank you . Thank you , Viktor . Happy birthday , Laine y . What do you think ? It 's fantastic . It 's what she drov e in " Eternity Fore v er . " - I know . - See ? - You hav e to thank her for me . - It 's from both of us . You know , you won 't be able to driv e it till you get your permit , but you can take it around the lot , okay ? H ere . What 's the matter ? I can 't accept it . Why ? Why , hone y ? I don 't want a car , Dad . What do you want ? I 'll giv e you whate v er you want . The old Viktor Taransky . I can 't stand to s ee you like this , clinging to Simone 's coattails . It us ed to be all about the work and now it 's all about her . And then she 's not e v en grateful enough to thank you . Oh , no , that was me . There you go again , blaming yours elf . Can 't you s ee what she 's done to you ? She 's taken adv antage . Mocking you . You des erv e better than Simone . - I hav e to go , Dad . - Okay . Oh , sure . She comes in all the time . - Really ? - Mm-hmm . - Is she nice ? - We 'v e be come v ery clos e . She told me she wanted to look at my s cript next week . - Jane ? - Gotta go . I 'm leaving early . If anybody needs me , I 'll be at the beach hous e having dinner with a certain someone . Elaine Christian , pleas e . Elaine . H i . H i . I was in the neighborhood . I just thought I 'd drop by . You don 't us e the front door anymore ? U h ... no . When is she coming ov er ? - About now . - Oh . Okay . I 'll just stay until she gets here . Well , she 's ... already here . What ? Elaine ... Simone is not coming ov er tonight or any other night . - I want you back , Elaine . - I want you back , too . Oh , Viktor ! Wait ! Viktor ! This is crazy . Who are we kidding ? I can 't compete with Simone . - Well ... - What woman can ? I 'd rather hav e you than Simone . - Belie v e me . - Oh . That 's so sweet . No , but I can 't let you do that , make that kind of sacrifice . - No . No . - God , this is strange . You know , I hav e stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am . - but- - - You hav e ? Well , it goes with the territory . For some reason , I can 't betray Simone . I can 't . There 's a goodness to her , Viktor . - No , there 's nothing to her . - Oh , Viktor . You say that now , but in the morning you would go back to her . - No . No . - You would , Viktor . She 's gonna retire . She 'll ne v er work again . Of cours e she will . H er public will demand it . - Not if I don 't let her . - You ? - Yeah . - How can you stop her ? I 'm gonna tell you a s e cret now , Elaine . Simone isn 't a real person . I inv ented her . E v ery actor is an inv ention . - Elaine- - - Pleas e . You 're lucky she 's loyal enough to stay with you . Maybe she 's staying out of pity . Who knows ? I mean , she certainly doesn 't need you . Listen , she 's thin air . - She 's pixels . - What ? Computer code molded by me from a mathematical equation I inherited from a madman . How much hav e you had to drink ? There 's no Simone . - I 'm Simone . - You 're Simone ? ! I 'v e done the impossible . I hav e re created the infinite nuances of a human being- - a human soul . I hav e taken nothing , and made it something . I hav e breathed life into a machine . - I made a miracle . - Viktor , pleas e stop . - Pleas e . - I swear , Elaine . As God is my judge , I swear . I made Simone . I made her . - You made Simone ? - Yes . Viktor ... she made you . You bitch . I 'll destroy you . Bravo ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Had a ro ug h nl g ht ? Let 's see lf they still lo e yo u after thi s . You made me . I made you first . Well , we 're back on " Good Morning , Good Day , " and we are here once again with the incomparable Simone . Simone , before the break you were taking a rather controv ersial position . I just think all elementary s chools should hav e a firing range . How els e can the children learn to defend thems elv es ? If there is a hole in the ozone lay er , how come I can 't s ee it ? Immigration ? God ! Isn 't it crowded enough ? But God created furry animals to be worn . Hav e you e v er tasted dolphin ? Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel . E v erybody always talks about the negativ es of cigarettes . But look at the benefits . I mean , you don 't eat as much . And you 'v e got something to hold in your hand . We always knew Simone wasn 't like other celebrities . - Oh , no . - She speaks her mind . She certainly does . It 's plastic , Hank . I know that 's the way you 'd want it . She killed you , Hank . Now she 's killing me . She 's a s erial killer . But I don 't know how to stop her . I mean , she 's taken on a life of her own . I can 't just come clean , you know , make some confession , be caus e ... I 'v e defrauded millions . The y 'd turn on me . I just can 't put the genie back in the bottle , be caus e ... if she suddenly stopped working , you know , just dropped out of sight , the y 'd ne v er let it rest . I tried killing her career , but the y like her e v en more . What am I gonna do ? Not another word , Hank . You are truly a genius . Thank you , Hank . Thank you . What 's the matter , Viktor ? You look so sad . Don 't you lov e me anymore ? It 's ov er , isn 't it ? I know what you 're thinking , Simone . Thl s l s a pho ney-balo ney wo rld . We 're all living one big lie . So , why shouldn 't you liv e , too ? You 're more authentic than all thes e people who worship you . And that 's the problem . You 're looking at the real fraud . I told mys elf this was all about the work . But if that were the truth , it wouldn 't matter to me that you get all the attention . And it does . It does . I 'm sorry , Simone . H ere I was trying to convince the whole world you existed . but what I was really trying to do was convince them that I exist . It 's not that you aren 't human . It 's that I am . I 'm sorry , Simone . It is my sad ... and solemn duty ... to announce ... the tragic passing of Simone . How did she die ? It was a rare virus she contracted on her Goodwill Tour of the third world . Did she suffer ? Mercifully , it was quick . I feel awful . It 's a great loss . You know , we 're going to hav e to restructure your deal . Can I s ee you later ? I mean , go away for the weekend ? How could you bring that up at a time like this ? One minute , Mr. Taransky . Oh my God . This has got to be a mistake . You hav e the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be us ed against you in a court of law . - You don 't understand . - Viktor ! - It 's a mistake ! - I 'll call my attorne y . Dad ! Elaine , call Bernard ! That 's why it was so light . I heard him say , " Die , bitch . I 'll destroy you . " It was so strange . H e actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie . H e 's a sick man . H e was a controlling madman . She was a prisoner . I blame mys elf . I wish I had done more to stop it . Forgiv e me , Mr. Taransky . I 'm just trying to understand here . Now , all thes e films and TV appearances and magazine cov ers and internet interviews , publicity photos , snapshots from her childhood ... All fake ? H mm ? This is fake . This is fake . Fake , fake , fake , fake , fake . - All fake ? - Yes . You understand perfe ctly . So , I will confess to fraud but not to murder . And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions , that 's also bogus ? No . No . The fan club 's real . It 's just what the y were worshipping is a computer code . Ones and zeroes . You couldn 't hav e killed Simone be caus e there was no Simone . - Rl g ht . Exactly . - And thi s Hank Aleno that yo u keep talkl ng abo ut , the reno wned failure who also happens to be so co nenl ently dead , now , perhaps this man that you claim helped inv ent Simone , is an inv ention hims elf . Oh , no . No . This whole thing is insane ! There is no Simone ! Look . E v en her name is fake . It 's not Simone . It 's " Sim One " - - See ? " Simulation One " ! It 's a computer code ! You really hated her , didn 't you ? Perhaps you could explain this to me , Mr. Taransky . Or is this tape doctored , too ? This is footage from the marina 's clos ed-circuit camera on the night in question- - altered of cours e . Can you tell us why you 're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn 't exist ? Well , it 's not her body . It 's her body of work . Viktor , Viktor , Viktor . Viktor . I know . Look . Look . Look . Why don 't you just come clean ? H uh ? Just tell the truth , you 're gonna feel better afterwards . I 'm telling the truth , and I don 't feel so good . H e y , we all know what happened . In a fit of jealous rage , you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat ... - Don 't say that . - ... that she bought for you . I did- - I can prov e- - I can prov e it to you . Let me just take you there . I 'll take you to the spot . I can prov e it . H ere . H ere . Come on . We can just go there , can 't we ? - Let 's just go . I 'll take you there . - Oh , Viktor . Okay , good . Thank you . Good work . Now you 'll s ee . What is this ? No , there 's driv es and dis cs . Where are the dis cs ? You hav e to go back down and get them . - That 's where the y are . - We can 't go back down there . - There 's dis cs down there ! - Calm yours elf ! - Pleas e ! Just- - - Sit him down . You must go down and get the driv es . H e y , you s ee what 's down there ? Plead guilty . Plead guilty and throw yours elf on the mercy of the court . It 's the best deal you 're gonna get . I could get the death penalty . Yeah . Yeah . You certainly will if you go to trial . A jury , in this kind of ugly mood . You killed an icon , for God 's sake . - Bernard , listen to me ! - Viktor ! Bernard , I didn 't kill anyone . Viktor , come on , it 's in the paper . There 's no one to kill . Bernard , I 'm a filmmaker . I was trying to say something . I wanted re cognition . I wanted to be appre ciated . So I created her . Bernard , there 's no one to kill . Do you understand ? An insanity defens e . Beautiful . Fantastic . - What are you doing ? - " I created her . " Viktor ! Jesus ! Jesus Christ , Viktor ! What am I doing ? Oh , what am I doing ? - Get me out ! - Viktor ! Get me another lawy er . I want another lawy er ! Why can 't people just take responsibility for their actions anymore , huh ? You know , I can almost forgiv e him for killing her . But , to deny her existence ? I can ne v er forgiv e that . Be caus e ob viously she existed , right ? I know it just as surely as you 're sitting there . She was the most vital woman I e v er met . So you did meet her ? Yeah , Laine y , what are you getting at ? I 'm the head of a major studio . Do you think I 'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I ne v er met ? No . No . I mean , really meet her . Like in the flesh . I know it 's embarrassing to admit it , but when I think about it honestly , I hav en 't . I 'v e ne v er really s een Simone up clos e ... touched her . Been in her physical pres ence . Hav e you ? Well- - we don 't want to belie v e daddy be caus e we don 't want to belie v e that we were taken in too . But , Laine y , there 's no e vidence that Simone isn 't real . Listen to what you 're saying , Mom . I mean , is there any e vidence that she is ? Do you hav e any idea what you 're doing ? What 's that ? One part of Dad 's story may hav e been true . Simone may hav e contracted a virus . Certain virus es can be cured . I hav e no idea what you 're talking about . Listen to me . There 's a ps y chiatrist in Ventura , well-respe cted , who is willing to testify under oath that you hav e diminished capacity due to the trauma of your divorce , 1 0 y ears of abje ct failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child . No more . I can 't go along with this hors eshit . - Come on , Viktor . - I did it . No . No . Viktor , come on . - Tell them the y can fry me . - No , Viktor , pleas e . - I did it ! - Viktor , pleas e . It was premeditated ! - Can you pleas e lower your voice ? - I strangled her . I bludgeoned her ! I s et her on fire and then I killed her ! - I did it ! - Excus e me . I think you better s ee this . Breaking news : International media star Simone is aliv e and well . H er studio releas ed this footage , just minutes ago . Simone reading today 's edition of " The LA Times . " Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary ? Details at the top of the hour . She 's indestructible . H e 's coming . Viktor . Oh , Viktor . Oh , hone y . I don 't know what you did or how you did it , - but thank you . - Well , it was Laine y . But don 't thank us too fast . You know what we hav e to do now . What ? Well , why stop at one character when you can hav e a whole cast ? You hav e to finish what you started . We can do it together . - Hav en 't we done enough ? - Could we go , pleas e ? Where we going ? Well , I was thinking ... how about you and Simone , moving in with me and Laine y ? That 's wonderful . What do you think , Laine y ? About you and Mom ? Well , about me and Simone . What I did . E v erything . I 'm sorry . Your mistake wasn 't making something fake , Dad . We 're fine with fake . As long as you don 't lie about it . Oh , come on , Viktor . It 's not a death s entence . No . It 's life . H e y , Viktor , remember us ? We probably ne v er met . I 'm Milton . How are you ? Max Say er from the E cho . - H i ! - It 's life . Just call . Fiv e minutes . All we need is fiv e minutes . Good e v ening , and welcome . Simone , the question on e v erybody 's mind is simply ... why ? Frank , you know as well as I do , living in this fish-bowl , the insatiable appetite of the media , with e v erything that was going on in my life , I just needed to drop out of sight for a while . I needed time , and Viktor bought me that time . - I owe him so much . - We all do . But now I understand you 're eager to get back to work and it 's not the kind of work we were all expe cting .

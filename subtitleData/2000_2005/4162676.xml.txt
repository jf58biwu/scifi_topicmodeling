 ( beeping ) His name is T 'raltixx . And you brought him on board ? He said he could adjust Moya 's electro-magnetics so that no one would be able to trace us . Oh , great . So , he 's like one of those mechanics on 60 Minutes who says he 's going to help and then he screws us . Crichton , we have to do something . Scorpius has left Wanted Beacons for us all over the Commerce Planet . What 'd you buy ? Dried food rectangles . That 's it ? That 's it . A thousand units of them . Crackers ? You just bought crackers ? - Don 't start . I told them to buy something else and they didn 't listen to me . As always . This is why we only had time to get crackers . That 's a Wanted Beacon . I saw ten of them in the market in the city . I had to get off the planet straightaway in case anyone figured out who we were . Well , it does make a beautiful souvenir , Aeryn . I 'm trying to find a trace signal to Scorpius ' location on it , and that way we can go the opposite direction . T 'raltixx is ready . Oh , yes . Um ... Zhaan has decided to test T 'raltixx 's device on your module . Wonderful . Wouldn 't want to use your Prowler , would we ? Well , no thanks to you the module has Moya modifications on it , so we can monitor and verify the results . The Sentra device I made for Moya will be much larger than this , of course . But it works on the same principle . It programs itself on the inverse of the power drive . I 'll need someone to start the module , please . Yeah , ' course you will . You know , I once bought a set of knives from this guy on TV . The cat swore to me that they could cut through bone , metal , shoes . Hell , he could cut through my damn car and still dice tomatoes . You know what ? He was lying . Uh , I don 't understand . If you don 't wish my services ... Bingo ! Give brainiac the fluffy doll . Please . Softer . Your , your voice hurts my ears . Okay . Softer . I don 't want you here . But they do . So I 'm going to start my engine . However , I love my module , so nothing funky better happen to it . Excuse me . Be sure to turn the power drive on for just ten microts . Ten exactly . More than that and the Sentra device will overheat and explode . It just gets better and better all the time , doesn 't it , guys ? One ... ( device whirrs ) ( engine roars ) ... five , six , seven , eight .. ... ten . ( systems power down ) Zhaan : Oh , by the goddess , it worked . See ? Nothing happened . ( laughing ) What ? What are you all looking at ? My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . A radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship , a living ship , full of strange alien life-forms . Help me . Listen , please . is there anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm being hunted by an insane military commander . I 'm doing everything I can . I 'm just looking for a way home . Nope. I don 't like it either , but he did it . My module disappeared , I disappeared . How is your module ? - Checked out fine . I checked out fine . While vaguely concerned about you , I 'm much more interested in how this will affect Moya . Look , T 'raltixx 's device may be our only way past the bounty hunters that Scorpius is going to send after us . That may be , but I don 't think it 's wise to go to the transformation yards on this planet . Besides , you can 't build a device out here. lt 's too big . Do you trust him ? You seen him ? He 's blind . He 's got a big head , but he 's blind . Barring the Yoda factor , if he gives us any trouble , we lock him up . But do you trust him ? Hell , no. I don 't trust him . Do I look stupid to you ? No , please , don 't answer that question . Pilot , you do the long-range scan on the planet . We send Aeryn out in the Prowler to check it out . We 're going to play this thing safe . I think it 's worth the risk . Changing course now . My planet is one solar day 's travel beyond the Five Pulsars . They 're beautiful . Yes . But I should warn you ... Crichton : Oh , here it comes . It 's ... don 't worry. lt 's nothing really . But , as we travel through the Pulsar Light occasionally , it affects lesser species . Well , define lesser species . Oh , genetic laborers , ungifted menials . It 's rare that it would disturb beings of your sentient stature . And what exactly does this light do to those lesser species ? Slight impairment of judgment . Some wooziness , perhaps . And that 's it ? That 's it . The effects are minor and temporary . Anybody feel anything ? Nope . No . I do . Oh , I feel good . The light . Oh , great . Two fingers . I thought you were blind . I am , but my other faculties have compensated . I have developed an internal radar of sorts . I may never be able to read a database but I can sense motion and avoid most DRDS . Hang on a sec . Pip , whatcha doin ' ? Well I 'm having sex with three Hynerian donkeys . What does it look like ? How come you weren 't up in Command ? Didn 't you want to see the Pulsar Lights ? I 've seen everything the universe has , Chrichton . Don 't worry . I was listening . The light won 't affect me . Are you saving some ? What ? Crackers . What you 're stuffing in your face . Are you saving some for the rest of us ? Oh , well , there 's plenty more . Right . What was all that about ? He thinks I 'm stealing food . He thinks I 'm taking more than my share . And are you ? No . Look , we got to talk . What was wrong with that one ? Uh , too noisy . My ears detect sounds well above your range . is there anything further from the engine core ? Fine. I 'll take you down another tier . What are you doing ? Finding T 'raltixx a place to bunk . Well , he 's not coming in here . He wouldn 't want to go in there , Cranky All of his senses are heightened , including his nose . You might kill him without intending to . Oh , but , you know , you might want to get back to the Center Chamber . Why ? No reason . Just , uh ... Chiana 's eating all the food . That guy eats and craps his body weight twice a day . I see . Hmm . Yes . ... reward for the capture of John Crichton . Reward for the capture of John Crichton . John Crichton . John ... What have you done ? I haven 't done anything . There 's obviously a burn glitch in the transmission and I 'm just trying to see if there 's any more data on it . Like what ? Like , uh , I don 't know . Like , why don 't you leave me alone and go and sit in the sun ? You wouldn 't tell me , would you ? Tell you what ? If there was another message on there . Say , a personal message from Scorpius , offering you a pardon for turning us in ? Do you have to be so frelling annoying ? I 'm trying to work here . Crichton : Zhaan , where are you ? I 'm up in the Maintenance Bay , John , about to have a fight with Aeryn . Don 't do that . Remember what T 'raltixx said about the Pulsar Light ? That 's right . He said it ... it affected lesser species . That might explain her behavior . Get down here . It 's your turn to babysit T 'raltixx . You brought his fuzzy ass on board , and he 's driving me nuts . Are you sure you 're all right , John ? I 'm fine . Just get your big , blue butt down here . ( groaning ) What are you doing ? - Hmm ? Nothing. I 'm-l 'm just ... What are you doing ? ! ( gasps ) Crichton . Crichton said Chiana was stealing food . Oh , so you decided to get here first . The little malikwill eat anything that 's not maggot covered . Obviously , so will you . Huh . Chiana told me that you would start to rob from us . But I 'm not. lt 's that bitch . It 's Chiana ! She 's not the one eating here . But if you want your crackers so badly ... I 'll give Your Eminence crackers . Let go of me ! You wanted crackers ? We 've got plenty . You see ? Now eat ! You 've got three stomachs , remember . One of them must be empty . Stop ! D 'Argo ! ( panting ) ( growling ) Pilot ? Yes ? I think there 's something wrong with Zhaan . She seems to be in some kind of trance . is she smiling ? Yes , I think so . She 's probably just enjoying the Pulsar Light . She 's a plant . Put her in the light , watch her smile . May I ask you one more thing ? Yes ? Crichton and the rest on Moya . Do you like them ? You know , I don 't think I do like them . I thought as much . Chrichton : Pilot ? Pilot ? Yes . Where are you ? We 've been comming you for half an arn . Why didn 't you pick up ? - l didn 't hear . There must be something wrong with your signal . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Have you noticed anything different around here , Shellhead ? In case you haven 't , let me be the first to inform you that people are starting to act a little strange . I want you to run a spectrum analysis to see what 's in the light to cause this . I 'll run a scan . Thank you so much . ( grunts ) Chiana : Aeryn , just give me a look . Aeryn : Will you stop it ? What are you hiding ? Oh , come on . Let me see it . If there 's nothing on there , then show me the whole message . Back off , Chiana . Oh , sister . I think maybe you should back off . Zhaan told us you ... Crichton : What the hell is going on here ? Nothing . She won 't play me the message . There 's a hidden message on there and she won 't show it to me . She 's out of her frelling mind ; there 's nothing on there . Show her the message . - What ? Show her the message. lf there 's nothing secret on the beacon then show her the message and she can get the hell out of here . Wait a minute . Why do you want me to watch it ? Oh . What 's on there you want me to see ? You know what ? Aeryn 's right . You 're freakin ' insane . Thank you . What 's going on in here ? Go back to your mountain , Grizzly . You 're not wanted here . They 're up to something . They are . They 're working together . First of all they don 't want me to watch the beacon and now they want me to watch the beacon . I , uh , I could give a squirrel 's nut what you watch . Why won 't you show her what 's on the beacon ? You get your hands off of me ! Oh , I don 't think so . Crichton : Aeryn . D 'Argo . What the hell are we doing ? Look at it . We 're fighting over lousy crackers and secret messages that don 't exist . You know , we were never normal , guys . Someone want to tell me what 's happening ? Sorry , John . Chrichton : That 's all right , champ . Just as soon as we get past the pulsars , everything will be back to ... normal . I hope so . And , Chiana , feel free to take a look or not to take a look . I really don 't care . Yeah . That 's right . I 'll ... I 'll do what I want to do . Great . Okay . You know , I was only trying to BE polite ! You all right ? ( chuckles ) Yeah , I 'm fine . You ? I 'm good . Oh , yeah . You 're real good . Pilot ? Pilot ! Don 't make me come up there . Pilot ? ! Crichton : A little . You said a little . You said the pulsars might affect judgment a little . I 'd say that this is a little more than a little . Well , I 'm sorry. I 've never heard of the pulsars affecting sentient beings so drastically . How and why is it not affecting you ? I think it must be my blindness . No one 's sure why but the light disturbs optic neurons and triggers distrust . I have no neurons , thus no distrust . Just enjoy it , John . Enjoy it . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Have another one , blue girl . ( laughing ) lonic radiation gives her photogasms . Unless she 's faking it . They can do that , you know . Hey , Zhaan , you faking it ? No . Oh , no . Well , perhaps we should turn back . My device is not worth risking any of you . Shut up ! We are not turning back . I want Moya to stay right here and go round in circles . There 's no point , is there ? Turning back ? We 're already halfway through the Pulsar Field . So the affects should start diminishing soon . One would hope so . They better . ( sniffing ) ( sniffing ) Rygel , I know you 're down here . ( gasping ) Let go of me ! Did D 'Argo send you to finish the job ? Be quiet . I 'm not going to hurt you , yet . But I don 't want anybody to hear us , so shut up . No , I don 't like you , Rygel . I think you 're a coward and a zannet , but maybe that 's why I can trust you . You 'll be too much of a coward to betray me . I trust you , too , Aeryn . - Shut up ! Now I 've got a plan and I need somebody to watch my back against the others . ( beep ) Do you want to volunteer ? Chiana : Aeryn 's definitely hiding something from me . There 's something else on that beacon . You think she 's trying to contact Scorpius ? Through the beacon . She could be trying to turn us in . Working with Crichton . ( growling ) I 'm not sure . The only way to protect ourselves is to get off this ship . Chiana , we ... You deal with it . Hello , D 'Argo . What do you want , Zhaan ? More light . Are you working with Crichton ? What are you talking about ? Leave me alone . Zhaan ? ( groans ) She 's definitely working with Crichton . Definitely . I 'm only judging on my experience with you , but I 've never seen such a deficient species . Have you run the scan on the Pulsar Light yet ? How do humans make it through a cycle , even half a cycle without killing each other ? We find it difficult . Have you run the scan ? You have no special abilities ; you 're not particularly smart , can hardly smell , can barely see , and you 're not even vaguely physically or spiritually imposing . is there anything you do well ? Watch football . Have you run the scan ? Nobody trusts you , Crichton . Do you know that ? Sometimes they pity you because of your incomp ... Mama always said , if you want something done , do it yourself ! Don 't touch my console . - You want to talk about incompetence ? ! Go away ! - Moya would dump your ass off ... I told you not to touch ... I warned you . Pilot , what the hell 's happened to you ? Nothing 's happening to me . Can you see the light ? What are you talking about ? The Pulsar Light . Does it physically come in here ? No , my readings of it are registered registered on Moya 's database . So you can 't actually see the light . So why are you being affected by it ? I 'm not . Now get out . I 've been in the light ! Zhaan 's been in the light , but ... ( snaps fingers ) Hey , guys , I think I 'm on to something . Stay back . We 're only taking our equal share of food . I 'm just trying to ... - lf he comes any closer , shoot him . Look , don 't make me crazy , okay ? It 's hard enough trying ... People have been stealing food , so we 're only going to take ... I don 't care about crackers . We do . We want ... - Food . is that what this is all about ? is that it ? Okay . Then where 's my ice cream ? What ? Where 's my ice cream ? Savage , I know almost every food in the galaxy ... Where 's my damn ice cream ? ! I have no idea what " izes greem " is . is that it , Sparky ? Gonna take the road well travelled ? Going to play dumb ? ( chanting ) : I scream , you scream , We all scream for ice cream . Baskin Robbins , Ben and Jerry 's , Good Humor . What 's your favorite ? Creamsicle or fudgesicle ? Pilot : T 'raltixx , where are my DRDs ? There are none up here . I 'm sorry , Pilot , I should have told you . I need their help . For what ? For the darkness . It hurts my eyes and makes me blind . I need to make light , Pilot . Bright light . What are you doing in there ? Don 't be alarmed . I 'm just altering Moya 's bioluminescence for a few moments . It won 't hurt her . Trust me . I don 't . The rest of your crew . Do you trust them ? What ? Do you trust them ? I ... I don 't know . Do you need the rest of them in order to function ? No . They get in the way more than help . I suspected that . I can help you , Pilot . If you help me , I think I may have a proposition that you will find agreeable . Go on . D 'Argo : Hurry up . You 're not moving fast enough . Then why don 't you get off your fat ass and help me ? Did you kill Zhaan ? No . No , she was walking around all sapped out so I , uh ... ( imitates gun zapping ) ( D 'Argo chuckling ) Now , she was reporting back to you , wasn 't she ? Crichton : Gilligan and Mary Ann . Maybe you 're Ginger , I 'd have to see you in a wonderbra to know . Where are you guys taking the Minnow ? We 're just getting off Moya . In my module ? I don 't think so . Afraid it needs this to fly . And I 've disabled the hangar doors , so no one is getting off the boat . He didn 't care about Zhaan . What ? Uh ... D 'Argo , he , um , he just left her here . Yeah . - You said she was working for him . She was . She , um ... Oh , she was ? Stay back ! No , Chiana , I ... - No , you stay back . Um ... I 'm not planning on stealing your food , Rygel . I know that . Well , then stay alert while I do this . We need some bargaining power ... Oh , stop plaking . I 'm watching your back . Oh , brilliant . At this rate , then I 'll survive , what ? An extra two microts ? If you don 't watch it , bitch , I 'll jump back into an air duct and you 'll be ... Right . Run away , as always ? I never run away. I ... strategically maneuver . Really ? ! ( Rygel whimpers ) Crichton : Here 's Johnny ! Hiya , honey . Go away . Hiya , kids . What 's going on ? This a French Revolution type of thing ? Stay out . Listen , I might be crazy . Could be . But I got a plan . What do you say , we all put our guns down ? We 'll lock them in the closet . That way nobody gets hurt . No . Honey , please . Aah ! Next time you 'll be a crouton , Crichton ! ( Rygel chuckling ) Crichton : Pilot ? Pilot ? Something the matter , Crichton ? It 's the damn Peacekeeper bitch . She 's barricaded herself in the Command . I think she 's trying to take over the ship . I 'm aware of her actions . Crichton : Shut her down . Lights , power , all of it . I 'm sorry , John , I cannot do that . What ? Pilot ? Pilot ! Got a bit of a problem , Commander ? Well , now you 've got one more . 'Cause the only way you 're going to get my weapon is if I 'm dead . Look at what you 're doing . What ? Look . ( laughing ) Yes , you 're right . You 're so right . He 's absolutely right . The power setting 's too low . Thank you ! So much better . You missed ! ( laughing ) Crichton . Named John Crichton . What you doing ? - Named ... John Crichton . Whoa ! Oh , no , no . Hey , Missy . Why you messing with that beacon ? Oh , hey , Johnny . Well , I 'm not messing with nothing . Uh-huh . ( grunting ) ( laughing ) Named John Crichton . Oh ... They just don 't get it . They don 't get it , Scorpy . They don 't get how crazy they are . You 're right , John . They don 't get it . They don 't get how crazy they are because ... because they stole the crackers . Mmmm . You 'll never be able to take over Moya . Pilot won 't let you . I have disabled his ability to spy on us up here . We just have to hope that the others keep him busy . Hope ? Your great plan depends on hope ? What if Pilot pumps poison gas in here ? We have to risk it , don 't we ? In any assault a solider has to take chances and attack the nerve center . Shut up . I don 't need a grunt to give me a military assault lecture . I wrote military assault lectures . You ? The only thing you 've ever assaulted is a plate of food cubes . Now shut up . And remember that cracker , that older kid , Howie Lewis , who beat you up ? You were just 12 . It took months , but you got even . And you poured sugar in poor Howie 's harley . Howie had no idea it was you . Yes , yes . Revenge is a dish best served cold and you like revenge , don 't you ? Shut up ! I hate it when villains quote Shakespeare . They 're coming to kill you , John . We 'd better get ready . I need more light . I 'm already boosting in three additional core channels . I need more ! Please , Pilot . You save me then I 'll save you . Save me from who ? From the others . Don 't you understand ? They 're plotting against you . You may not trust me , but believe me , trust them much less . Boosting in two more core channels . Drop it . Oh , go ahead . Try it , Medusa . Try it . Down , boy . Roll over . Good boy . Go on . Kill me . Go on , John , do it ! Then we can go to the beach . I know a place with naked Sebacean girls and margarita shooters . Go away , Scorpy . You 're not real . Uh-uh ... What ? What ? Am I being ... irrational ? Oh . Well , have a little pain . Go on , finish him . Finish him . Then we can go to that little Eye-Talian joint I know . I don 't like ... Eye-Talian . Don 't be a coward . Kill him . Not me , him ! ( laughing ) D 'Argo ? Zhaan ? Hi , baby . Crichton . Don 't. I ... I can help you . No , no , no , no , no . I 'm still achingfrom the last time you " helped " me . What a slut . ( laughs wildly ) ls this why your family abandoned you ? 'Cause you 'd spread them for anybody , anytime ? John , please . Please don 't . No , ' fraid not . My little black book is all full . John , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . Show a little bit of patience . Tie her up . Then we can save her for dessert . Kill the others . Then we can have a little bit of fun with her . Nice . I like that idea . Hurry up . Do you hear him ? Hurry up . Crichton 's coming . You 're going to sell me out , aren 't you , when he comes ? Huh ? You 're going to switch sides . No . You 're lying . You know how I know that ? Because you always lie . You have no integrity , you have no honor . You cheat , you steal , you lie . You stuff your face ! That 's you ! ( screaming ) Hell , hell , hell . This is becoming a problem you 're gonna need professional help with . First you betray the Peacekeepers and every vow you 've made since you were born . And now poor Sparky here ? ( laughing ) Tell me , Princess , when you 're old and fat will you have anything to look back on with pride ? is that it ? Oh , don 't stop . Why don 't you make another speech , you self-important , deficient little man . All you ever do is talk ! Your father was the hero , you know . He did things . You , you 're just a test monkey that screwed up your first experiment . That is good ! Yeah . That is fantastic ! Coming from a frigid , flat-butted , Peacekeeper skank . Kill her . Then we 'll have pizza . And margarita shooters . Go on , John . Kill her . Do it . Do it . Nobody ... has margaritas ... with pizza . You 're out of your mind , John . I know . Are you cracking up , little man ? Hello ? I 'm okay . Aeryn , listen to me ... Oh , no , no , no , no . I am tired of having to always listen to you . Aeryn , listen ... I just shot Scorpius . Shut up . You 're wrong , you know . When I 'm old and fat ... when I 'm old , there is one thing I 'll look back on with enormous pride and that is killing you . Aeryn , he wanted me to shoot you . ( guns clicking ) Damn ! ( guns clicking ) Dren ! Have you got any spare cartridges ? ( both screaming ) Hiya , kids . Let me go. I command it , you miserable ... Oh , no one 's going anywhere , not even to Disneyland . Not before we all have the breakfast of losers . Oh , look , everybody , Sunshine 's awake . Renaldo ! Oh , even on a flesh wound . Ow , ow , ow , ow ! That must hurt . Sorry . Now that we 're all here and so happy , do you think we can all get along for three microts ? No . No ? But D 'Argo , I need you to understand that crackers don 't matter . Whoo ! Have I got your attention now ? Good . So , class ... today 's assignment is ... anyone ? Anyone ? Anyone ? Anyone ? A brand-new car ! No , it 's T 'raltixx . T-apostrophe-r-a-l-t-l-double x . T 'raltixx . Since it came on board , we 've been fighting about everything including these . Now , I 've been acting twisted as well . Still am . Been seeing Scorpius like he 's guest starring on Hawaii Five-O . How crazy is that ? But I realized something . Friggin ' nuts that I am , it 's not the Pulsars affecting me . Look , if you want me to believe anything you 're saying ... Shut up ! Chiana : Frell you ! We are past the Pulsars . So how come we 're acting even crazier ? Zhaan ? Stop bothering me , I 'm busy . Yes , yes , yes . Private moment number 344 . Tell them . You tell them . Zhaan . When I was near T 'raltixx , I was more affected than when I was in the light . He ... he made me feel ... Enough . Go for 345 . So , I have ... as much as I hate to do this ... oh God ! I have to ask for your help . No . ( making beeping sounds ) Wrong answer . I 'm at system 's overload . I need more light . But why ? I 'm not sure if I can . More light ! All right . Can you feel it , Pilot ? All of Moya is beginning to glow . I am magnificent ! Look , I want you to look at what he 's doing to Moya . Look at the walls ! They 're glowing . Look . Why ? Why would he want us to fight amongst each other ? He wants us out of the way so he can create light . I noticed between pleasures he has hundreds of DRDs working . The sluice chambers are glowing . I think it 's time that we paid this creep a visit . And kill him . Undo me . Can I trust you ? No . At least you 're honest . Now ... unless you plan on actually pulling the trigger , don 't ever pull a gun on me like that again . I was making a point . So was I . Don 't . Stop it . Focus here . Okay . T 'raltixx said that we 're attacked through our optic neurons . That 's how he 's getting to us . But I can deal with it . You just gotta find a way to keep the light and the heat off me and I 'm going to go in and kill him . You ? ! We 're not sending you in there after him . Oh , yeah ? Well , I 'm the only around here keeping it vaguely under control . ( Rygel scoffs ) Says who ? Says me , Buckwheat . You are no warrior . I will kill T 'raltixx . No , you will not. I will . You 're wounded . - No way . I want the first shot . Look at you two bozos . You 'd kill each other before you got anywhere near T 'raltixx . He 's right . He 's got to do it . Why ? Oh , don 't you get it , furball ? Look , Crichton 's the only one not affected by T 'raltixx ' cause he 's deficient . Who you calling deficient ? You ! You 've got the worst eyes out of all of us . That 's why your optic nerves aren 't being affected . I got great eyes . They 're better than 20-20 and they 're blue . Okay , so , can you read the symbols on the basin over there ? There 's nothing there . ( chuckles ) " Warning ... " don 't flush corrosives ... down the waste tunnel . " Mmm . That 's all right . That 's a joke . Aeryn : Excellent . If we 're going to let blue eyes save the day , we better come up with a very good plan . I 'm not deficient . I 'm superior ! Humans are superior . What the hell is this ? Heat-deflecting paste . You 'll burn up in there without it . Smells like puke . I pre-digested it to increase its potency . It 's puke ? ! We 're going to have to move fast . All of Moya is glowing . I hate these goggles . They look like crap . Stop whining . You sound like a zelmad . They 're the only thing that are going to stop you from going blind in there . Probably will , anyway . Here . This may be of use to you . I made from a piece of my Prowler , and it will withstand a zacian laser pulse . Thank you . Solar reflective flare wrap . Pull it on tight . Does this strike any of you superior beings as a little bit ironic ? Chiana : What ? That I 'm the deficient one and I 'm still saving your butts . Chiana : Bend over . We soaked it in Zhaan 's bile paste for as long as we could . Great . I look ridiculous , don 't I ? Rygel : Don 't worry . This is T 'raltixx 's disappearing device , so it won 't matter how ridiculous you look . ( humming " Ride of the Valkyries " ) We are going to die . We 've attached you to the module in the Transport Hangar . Fire the drive up for ten microts , no more . No , mippa pippie , I do not want to blow up . When you get in there , cut off as many of the power conductors as you can . That should reduce his strength so that you can then get close enough to kill him , alright ? Right . Damn , it 's bright in there . You ready ? Now , Rygel . Only ten . Yes . is it working ? It 's working . Go , John , go . There 's someone in here , Pilot . I see no one . Five ... six ... No ! What are you doing , Pilot ? Nothing . My light ! Nine ... ten . Eleven ... twelve ... Stop ! ( powering down ) Crichton ! Ahh ! Crap ! You can 't stop me , Crichton . I have the light . But humans are superior ! You 're too weak , Crichton . I will kill you ! I will get the light and take over your ship . And murder you all ! Give me the light ! The light ! I need more light ! ( wailing ) Light ' em up ! - You cannot stop me , Crichton . Go on , kill me . Well , there are thousands just like me . We will find another Leviathan to make our light . And when we do , we 'll spread like a plague ! We 'll rise from our dormancy and kill you all ! I told them it was a mistake bringing you on board . ( screaming ) ( yelling ) Pilot : I have talked with everyone else . All I can say is I 'm terribly sorry . T 'raltixx somehow brought out the worst in me . I think he brought out the worst in all of us , Pilot . Yes . Your apology is accepted . Thank you . Thank you both . I , uh ... I am ashamed of what I did . I thought you were going to kill me . I 'm sorry , Rygel . Can you forgive me ? No . Not yet . That did it . Damn , that was heavy . How 'd you move it by yourself ? Hmm ? Oh , I don 't know , I just did . Chiana : Some of the things you said ... Yeah , look , I 'm sorry , really . Oh , no , no , look , don 't apologize . I was impressed . How did you come up with all that crap ? I don 't know , Pip , it was just there . Did I ... did I say anything awful , Chiana ? ( laughing ) Chiana : You don 't remember ? Zhaan : No , T 'raltixx triggered such a ... an intense reaction in me I blanked everything out . Whoa , I wish I could do that . Chiana : No , no , Zhaan . Look you were the best out of all of us . You looked like you were having a great time . Listen , uh ... anything I said , I , uh ... I ... I know . Me , too . Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall . And all the kings horses and all the kings men ... Hey , Zhaan ... How do we take it all back ? I don 't know . Yeah .

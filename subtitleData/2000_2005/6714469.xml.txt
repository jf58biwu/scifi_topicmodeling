 In spite of all the warnings , she was smoking in bed and fell asleep . Bad move ! And the fire begins . It 's show time ! Don 't worry , ma 'am . I 'm here to save you ! Keep those people back ! This is an emergency ! Don 't you dare die on me ! Breathe , damn it , breathe ! She 's gonna make it ! She 's gonna make it ! What the- - Oh , damn ! Though it may be hard to believe that a single biology professor ... making in excess of $ 17,500 a year ... could manage to find time to grade your first biology research papers , I did . As you can see , there was a shocking statistical anomaly . Pretty much all of you got A 's . You deserve to congratulate yourselves . I got a good feeling about this group . And I think that the parade of A 's will continue to the end of the semester . So much for the bell curve , right ? Bell curves suck ! Mr. Kane ? Dr. Kane , seems to be a mistake here . My brother and I each got a C-minus on our reports . C-minus . Me too . Allow me to share something with the entire class . As I was grading papers , I came across two gems , both entitled " Cells Are Bad . " And both with just one paragraph ... which I unfortunately committed to memory . " Cells are bad . My uncle lives in a cell . It 's ten foot by twelve . And he has to read the same boring magazine every day . The end . " You 're talking about our papers , aren 't you , Dr. Kane ? Yes , I am . Although my standards are not where they used to be ... I still could not bring myself to put an A on top of those beauties . Hope you understand . - Sure . - Yeah , okay . Let 's get back to work at the Periodic Table which is not , as some suppose- - A meteor ? Where ? Route 89-A . Yeah , I got it . Rest assured I will be there . Okay . Bye . How 's it look , Professor ? It 's tight . Really tight , Nadine , but not too tight . You just don 't have the points . I 'm sorry . Don 't take it too hard . Geology 's a tougher subject than people think . Are you sure ? Couldn 't you check again ? I really need this credit to get into nursing school . Nursing school ? Wouldn 't you be more comfortable where people 's lives weren 't dependent on you ? Actually , what I really want to be is Miss Arizona . But my consultant says nursing school will really impress the judges . - Makes me look like I help people . - Ready for lunch ? Or have you already eaten ? I was concluding a teacher-student conference with Nadine , Ira . Harry , your dedication to your job is an inspiration to us all . Regrettably , I have a prior lunch engagement with Professor Kane . We 'll talk about your extra credit later , okay ? Cheer up . Let me grab my stuff . Where you taking me ? A meteor hit last night . Oh , that 's what that was . As the Glen Canyon representative of the U.S. Geological Survey ... I have been assigned to check it out . I 'm taking you in case I actually have to do something scientific . Then we eat . You 're a representative of the U.S.G.S. ? Signed up over the Internet . Were you on some cheerleader site and accidentally linked to the U.S.G.S. ? Something like that . Watch it . Take it easy . That 's my baby . Watch it . Take it easy . That 's my baby . There you go . Easy . Come on , be careful ! Who 's gonna pay me for the damage to my goddamn car ? Son , I told you we don 't do that . It 's force majeure . Force majeure , my ass ! That car 's a classic ' 73 Buick Rivera . Who are you ? Harry Block , United States Geological Survey . This is my secretary , Ira Kane . We 're here to investigate the meteor . If that 's what it is . Of course it 's a damn meteor . It almost blew up my damn car . I 'm still fuzzy on what you were doing here in the middle of the night . With Betty Lou here . For the thousandth time , I was practicing for my fireman 's exam ... which started seven minutes ago , so I 'd appreciate if you let me go . You and the blonde found the meteor ? Yeah , I found it . It bounced my car 200 feet in the air . Can I go ? Bob , get him out of here right now . Don 't leave town . Sheriff , is this ... the point of penetration ? Yeah , it punched through into a cavern 80 feet down . That 's a hole . Oh , damn it ! Next time , you 're carrying this case . You 're the U.S.G.S. representative . That responsibility comes with the badge . Oh , my God ! Look at that . I believe we 've located the target . - Big smile , fellas . - Cheese ! Hold it up now . All right ? It 's hot ! It 's really hot . I 'll hold you up . More nightstick . Look at these jackasses . At ease , gentlemen . The Feds are here . Feds ? What Feds ? - Who let you down here ? - Let 's not get combative , Lieutenant . The U.S.G.S. and local law enforcement have a long history of cooperation . We 're here to get some scientific samples , if that 's okay with you guys . Ah , yeah , sure . We got all the photographic evidence we need . Carry on . Thank you . Keep up the good work . Just hit last night and it 's got stuff growing on it . Could be cave moss . Cave moss after just a few hours ? That 's peculiar . Let 's get a sample and get out of here . It 's bleeding . It 's a rock that bleeds . Now that 's really peculiar . Let 's bag it . I don 't know if this geological society gig is all it 's cracked up to be . Yeah , it pads out my resume , but am I growing as a person ? Am I growing as a Division Three women 's volleyball coach ? Are you gonna do those spectro tests it says to do in the guidebook ? Spectrograph . Yeah , I will do a full spectroscopic analysis . Your resume will shine . Good . I got to get to the game . Let me know if you find anything . Ira ? Are you sure you can handle this by your lonesome ? All right , all right . That 's impossible . Ten base pairs . No , that can 't be . We need this ! Come on , ladies , look alive ! Tina , when Lisa goes for the spike , you 've got to cover the line . Lisa , two hands ! Two hands ! God gave you two goddamn hands for a reason ! Big news . The most amazing thing . The meteor samples are teeming with one-celled organisms . Their metabolic rates are off the charts . They 're dividing at an incredible rate . It 's practically exponential . Their DNA has ten base pairs . Ten base pairs . That 's good to know . Thank you , Ira . The DNA of all life on Earth has only four base pairs . Come on , ladies ! Look alive ! Harry , these are organisms from another world . They 're aliens . Is the Nobel Prize paid in installments , or in a lump sum like the lottery ? Let 's not get ahead of ourselves . Here . My office . I 'm not getting ahead of myself . I 'm concerned about the tax consequences . - Why in here ? - Just wanted to be cautious . It 's our discovery . I 'm all tingly . I 'm no biologist , but how many cells do single-celled organisms have ? If we 're gonna be important scientists , you have to act the part . Why don 't you take a look ? There are multi-cellular organisms in there . - Yes , I know . - But they weren 't there before . - So they snuck in . - There was no sneaking in . It 's- - No , it 's too amazing . - What ? - It 's like they 're evolving . They 're growing . They 're growing into more complex organisms . It 's evolution . Nobel , here we come . Yeah , but it 's 200 million years ' worth in just a few hours . That 's fast . You have no idea . Get ready . On my signal . Go ! Recruit , wake up . Wake up ! Go ! Go , go , go ! The hose ! This thing here ! Sorry . - Move it ! Move it ! - Wayne , go ! Go , go ! Come on ! Buddy , these things happen . There 's another test in six months . Six months ? I can 't wait six months ! At least you still got the pool gig at the country club , right ? Great . Thanks a lot . Drive careful . I got it . I got it ! I do this . Looks like we got visitors . Class , since this is our first field trip , please obey a few simple rules . Dirt ! Nice footwear . It 's perfect for spelunking . Don 't touch anything . Don 't move anything . Don 't even breathe unless we tell you to . And wear your protective gloves at all times . - Why do we have to do this ? - Firsthand field experience . The very meat and potatoes of geology . - Will this be on the final ? - Yes ! - Officer , nice to see you again . - Professor , what 's up ? - We came to pick up the rock . - Pick it up ? What ? Yeah , we- - Just orders from the U.S.G.S. They want it under controlled conditions . It 's very technical . Oh , technical stuff . It 's technical . Okay , go right ahead . - We 're gonna haul it out of here . - Sure , go ahead . Deke and Danny , remember what we talked about , right ? You are in charge of the hoisting . Get the winch up to the hole . Understand ? Fellas , stop nodding and just stare at me for a second , okay ? Focus . You understand what I want you to do ? - Yeah , we got you . - Yeah . Go do it . Ira , I 'm picking up a heavy creepy vibe here . A lot has changed . Class , I know these look like mushrooms , but refrain from eating them . Oh , it smells disgusting . Nadine , sometimes science stinks . It 's the game we play , baby . Rotten egg smell . - Hydrogen sulfide , right ? - Yeah , and ammonia and methane . It 's like it 's converting the atmosphere . Look at all this rudimentary plant life . It 's amazing . I don 't want to get all girly , but I feel something wiggling around my toes . The ground does seem to be moving . Whoa ! Flatworms . Millions ! Yuck ! Oh , God ! Barely 18 hours and we already have flatworms . - Look , look ! - Hey , there they are ! - Hi , Dr. Kane . - Hey , Dr. K. ! - Man , I almost went down ! - Awesome . Come here , little buddy . I 'm not gonna hurt you . You didn 't hurt it . You killed it . The oxygen must have killed it . It must need its own atmosphere to live . Yeah . Grab a specimen jar . We 'll try to scoop some atmosphere in there with them . Yeah , right . It took us two billion years to do what they did in just a couple of days . Yeah . Those little germs are the embodiment of the American dream . I 'm so sorry to interrupt , Professor Block . But I was wondering if I 'm correct in assuming that that field trip ... fulfilled any of my missing credit requirements . You know , Nadine , you are a very , very smart girl . But if you would just focus- - Professor ... the little wiggly worm things are breaking . Look . He 's not breaking . It 's splitting . It 's mitosis . That 's how they reproduce . No sex ? No time for sex . Bummer ! Little guys are splitting again . Put it away . Look , we call no one , tell no one . This is our secret , right ? What about the government ? Isn 't this the kind of thing they get involved in ? No government . I know those people . Absolutely not . You do ? This is our discovery , and we have to maintain absolute control . We have to do more research and check our findings . Document everything . Wayne ? What 's this ? That would be an all-cotton towel , sir . I believe it 's a Fieldcrest . It 's a damp towel . Why is a damp towel on my chaise ? Okay , let me take care of this for you . You should , because you 're pool manager , and you know what to do about it . What the hell ? Where did you guys come from ? You 're dead now . Whoa ! What the- - Harry , when I checked the samples this morning ... I found three different subspecies . These things are evolving so quickly . God knows what we 'll find when we get back to the- - Whoa ! Please tell me there 's an air show today . Shit ! Can I help you ? Yeah . Harry Block , Ira Kane . United States Geological Society . We 're doing some important research . This is our site . I 'm sorry . Not anymore . You 're not on the list . What do you mean ? We come here all the time . This is not a nightclub . Why don 't you take it somewhere else ? I know my Constitutional rights ! Harry ! Look , maybe you can call your superior . We can have a word with him . I have a Harry Block and Ira Kane claiming- - Punk . What ? You got to know how to talk to the white man . - White man gonna get his ass whupped . - Very sensitive . Can 't be yelled at . - Did you say Kane ? - Yeah . - The Ira Kane ? - Yeah . I 've been looking forward to this for a long time . You bastard ! Hey , hey , hey ! Get his gun ! Take it easy . They 're good . Up ! You 're responsible for the worst month of my life ! - What the hell was that about ? - I don 't know . Drive straight down to the command tent . They 're expecting you . - Go . - Thank you . That 's the guy that had me in diapers for over a month ! - Men , General Woodman 's expecting you . - Russell Woodman ? What an unexpected surprise . For me too . I didn 't realize we were on a hugging basis . The same old Ira Kane . And you must be- - Harry Block , this is General Russell Woodman , head of U.S. Army Research . - General . - Harry . You two know each other ? Ira used to work for me . Right , Ira ? I worked with you , actually . You used to work in army research in the Pentagon ? Yeah . And all this time I thought you were just a school teacher . No . How did you find out about this ? You leave the Pentagon , you don 't call me , you don 't write . We like to keep tabs on our prodigal sons . So you tapped my phone ? No . We 're not the KGB . Actually , we 've been monitoring your computer . His computer ? All those girls in the photos are over 18 . Yes , I 'm sure . - I should 've figured . - Yes . And you should 've known better than to try to keep something this big from us . And the CDC . Just in time . Ira , this is Allison Reed , senior researcher in epidemiology ... at the CDC . Nice underwear . Garter belt ? At a day function ? I can do it . Thank you very much . I 'm okay . Dr. Kane . I 'd heard about your recklessness , but you are way out of line . Do you realize how dangerous this situation could have become ? It 's nice to meet you too , ma 'am . No need to play the blame game , Allison . No harm , no foul . We 're all very appreciative of Dr. Kane and Mr. Black 's discovery . Block . Block . I 'm sorry . The confirmation of the existence Of life outside this planet- - Would be the greatest scientific discovery of our time . Yes , actually . Yes , it would . And you have my word that you 'll be kept in the loop from this point forward . You son of a bitch . What do you mean , kept in the loop ? General , we are the loop . We won 't cut you out , but we do need to take control . We 're following protocol . You remember protocol , don 't you ? Yeah , I got some protocol right here for you , Russell . Come and get it . Look , this research must continue under careful government control and scrutiny . We secured the area . We 're constructing an air lock into the cavern and a field research facility . So there 's not a lot for the science department ... of Glen Canyon Community College to do here . Did you catch that condescending tone when he says Glen Canyon Community- - We are following well-established federal guidelines- - Ma 'am , please . Russell , don 't pull this crap . We deserve to be here . You deserve to be here ? You 're lucky anybody 's ever let you near a science laboratory again , Ira . You 're a disgrace , and a dangerous one at that . Lieutenant , show these men out . This is horseshit . It 's not over . You 're in for a fight , Russell . Would you stop following me , please ? Thank you . We 're not gonna bend over and take this ! Fruit basket for Russell Woodman ! Happy holidays , General ! Cute . Dr. Kane , are you asking me to bar the federal government ... from involvement in a discovery as significant as this ? No , no . We 're asking you to make sure that the local scientists ... who actually made the discovery continue to play a significant role . They kept us out for almost two weeks . We put our lives on the line to find these little guys , Your Majesty . We just want to be there for them as they grow up . We were the first team at the site and the initial testing was done in our lab . The facilities at Glen Canyon Community College are a joke , sir . They weren 't a joke when I went there , General . Your Honor , if the court would allow me to depose Dr. Kane ? Depose me ? We think your past is very relevant , Dr. Kane . These issues speak directly to his competence as a scientist . Dr. Kane , you were a top-level researcher ... at USAMRI D from ' 94 to ' 97 , were you not ? Yes , that 's correct . And you were summarily dismissed in the summer of 1997 . Any idea why ? My services were no long required ? Uh-huh . So in your opinion ... your firing had nothing to do with an experimental anthrax vaccine ... you developed and gave to nearly 140,000 U.S. soldiers in May of that year ? I see where you 're going with this . It may have been a factor . You 'd have to ask the Joint Chiefs of Staff . I 'll make a note to do that . But for now ... can you tell me what happened to the soldiers that were inoculated ? Well , none of them got anthrax , if that 's what you 're asking . What did they get ? As with any new vaccine ... there were certain side effects associated with it . Could you be more specific ? It was a wide range of things . It 's very technical . I 'd hate to waste the court 's time getting into it . Humor me . Some debilitating stomach cramps . Severe diarrhea . Memory loss . Yes , go on . Any more symptoms ? Partial facial paralysis , temporary blindness , drooling ... bleeding gums , erectile dysfunction , uncontrollable flatulence . I think that 's it . One more question . Do you happen to remember what the soldiers called this illness , Dr. Kane ? Yeah , they called it the Kane Madness . Keep your head up . You know she wanted to give you some , right ? Were you even in that courtroom ? Getting barbecued like baby back ribs ? It 's all foreplay , baby . Oh , we 've been hit . Forget the foreplay . We just got screwed . - Empty . - This is very , very bad . Damn it ! I don 't care who they are . Stealing is stealing . Perfect . They took the rock , the samples , all the little wormy critters . All the data 's gone . The JPEG files , the DNA sequences . They cleaned us out . - I 'm calling the cops . - The cops ? They are the cops ! Then what ? Let me ask you , how come you get to be a colonel and I 'm just a private ? I was a colonel . And you obviously served your country with distinction . Consider yourself lucky . The penalty for impersonating an officer is prison . Yeah , maybe for you , white boy . Me , they hang . Colonels first . I was at it for 12 hours . My toes were starting to hurt I was standing so long . Stop it . - Just act like you belong . - Don 't worry , I got this . - Pick up that butt , soldier . - Sorry , sir . - And tuck that shirt in . - Yes , sir . Get the door . Thank you , Private . Don 't get used to this . Oh-oh , look at that . Enjoy your lunch , gentlemen . Okay , I 'll be right back . Your girlfriend , 11 : 00 . Darn it . That woman 's a menace . Testing , one , two . One , two . One , one , one , two . This is D.J. Harry Block here , and I 'm an Aquarius . Will you stop ? I can hear you . Don 't you snap at me , unless you want an angry Solid Gold dancer on your hands . Lieutenant ? Yeah ? Who 's that ? I don 't know . I don 't have anything on my schedule . Maybe it 's the guys from sector 12 doing a nocturnal specimen run . - You know how those guys are . - Oh , yeah . This place has changed . Can you believe this ? Look at that . Our little babies are growing up . Three weeks , it 's already like a rain forest in here . Looks like the kitchen from my first apartment . Harry , check that guy out . Is it coming or going ? That tree just ate it . Everything here seems to be food for something else . - So stay off the menu , huh ? - You got that right . Ira , come here , look at these little things . Cool . Hey , snag one . - Snag one ? - Snag one and put him in the bucket . I seen this movie . The black dude dies first . You snag it . Don 't be scared . We came for a specimen , now snag one . He 's not gonna hurt you . He 's turned the other way . He 's eating . Come on , my little red lobster . Come on , my sexy little crustacean . Come on . Whoa ! Ira , look at that backside . Theater in the round . That 's the kind of trunk space you want in a late model car . Who does that remind you of ? I have no idea what you 're talking about . She 's been throwing it at you enough . - Dr. Reed ? - Bull 's-eye . Excuse me , Dr. Reed ? Did you authorize a walk-through ? Nope . Why ? You should probably take a look at something . Here . You 'd like to roast that rump . You 'd like to butter that mother . That is an ice image . And I appreciate your assumption ... that there is an actual sexual human being ... underneath all Dr. Reed 's deep-seated neuroses . - But I don 't think so . - What ? I think she is a humorless ice queen . Ira , that 's just a cover . Don 't you know that ? All she needs is a good humping . Oh , Ira . Ira ! Harry , stop that . We gotta get a piece of the asteroid like we came for . And cut that out . It disturbs me . - Ira ! - Don 't do that behind my back . - I 'm not doing it . I 'm just walking . - Cut it out . Let 's bag that and get the hell out of here . I 'm ready when you are , Colonel . This disco suit is making me chafe . Shoo , fly . Hold it right there . Dr. Reed , so nice to see you again . We were just leaving . You 're in violation of the judge 's orders . I could have you arrested . Want to talk about violations ? What about our lab ? - Got any Raid ? - What are you talking about ? You stole our computer hard drive , samples , files . Everything . - I didn 't steal anything . - Your buddies there cleaned us out . Let 's be honest . You 've been trying to grab credit on our discovery . All we 're trying to do is take back a piece of what 's rightfully ours . Credit has nothing to do with this . I 'm concerned about public safety . - Is this true ? Are you aware of this ? - No . Something 's in my suit . You 're not gonna believe him . He openly admitted to hacking into our computer . Harry , what ? There 's something in my suit ! It 's impossible . It 's sealed ! The fly ! There 's a fly in my suit ! - Don 't take off your helmet ! Oxygen ! - It 'll kill it . Do you see it ? Look , look . Do you see it ? - No . - No ? - You 're all right . Who 's the man ? - You 're the man . - No , you 're the man . - I 'm the man . Okay . Oh , God . It 's in me ! For the love of everything good and holy , get this goddamn thing out of me ! You 're gonna be okay . Cut him open . Let 's get this thing . Cut me open ? There goes your Christmas gift , Judas ! It 's moving down his leg . - What do we do ? - Maybe amputate . Whoa , don 't take the leg ! Don 't let ' em take my leg . Is there anything else you can do ? He thinks he 's an athlete . Doctor , look . It 's heading for his testicles . Take it ! Take the leg ! Wait , wait ! It 's going the other way . Give me some forceps . I might be able to catch it in his colon . - How 're you going in ? - Rectally . - Ohh ! - I 'll get the lubricant . - No time for lubricant . - There 's always time for lubricant ! - Flip him ! - Go . Okay , here we go . - Try to relax . - Everything 's gonna be okay . I 'll shove this gurney up your ass ! See if you relax , Ira . - Cheek spreader . - All right . I 'm going in . Don 't clench ! You 're so brave . - A little more . - No more ! - A little deeper . - No deeper ! - Squeeze my hand . Squeeze it ! - Almost there . Open up . Open up ! - Breathe . Breathe . - I 'm breathing ! - Almost there . - You 're there ! It 's over , it 's over . It just died . Don 't you ever do that again ! The size of that thing inside you ! It was like this ! You took it like a man . You 're all right . You did great . Can I get you anything ? Ice cream . I 'd like an ice cream , please . - What favor ? - It doesn 't matter . It 's for my ass . Man ! Now I 'm a Hawaiian warrior ? I 'm thinking seriously about moving . Maybe to California , start over . Because of the fireman thing ? Big deal . You flunked out . You know how many times I 've flunked in my life ? A ton . Hey , pool boy , you watering down the mai tais ? No , sir . But let me fix you something special . 'Cause you 're nothing but a big , fat monkey turd . Excuse me ? What ? Drink 's almost ready . Here you go . That should tide you over . And don 't forget , folks That 's what you get , folks For making whoopee Oh , damn it ! That 's gonna stain . Barry ! Barry , where are you ? I can 't see you . Where are you ? I 'm down here , my pet , by the water . Something just ate Barry Cartwright ! That 's too bad . I don 't get it . How does someone with your background ... credentials and talent end up ... like you ? Thank you . Your partner could have died . What were you thinking ? I was desperate . I 've been exiled out here for 5 years , watching the world pass me by ... and this amazing discovery falls into my lap . I look at it as my ticket out of here . But I don 't suppose you would understand that . No , how could I ? I 'm a humorless ice maiden in need of a good humping . - You heard that , huh ? - Loud and clear . Don 't think you know so much about me . You don 't . I 'm sure I don 't . Thank you for not calling the cops . Oh , be careful ! Stop being such a baby . I 've seen that car before . No more bran for me . Hey , girls . Hey , girls . Stop . Cut it out . Hey , it 's the meteor guy . What 's in the bag ? Your blow-up doll ? Oh , no . I got something that you 're really gonna like . - What happened to you ? - Shut up . You guys teach here ? Yeah . I was thinking about taking some classes . But I decided to hit the job market early and get a jump start on things . Can we help you ? Yeah . A guy got killed at my country club last night . A real douche bag . That just doesn 't make it right . It was an animal attack . Isn 't that something ? Happened by the water hazard on the fourth green . The lady he was banging saw the whole thing . We chased this sucker on the fairway , and then it died in a sand trap . It just died ? How ? Like it was choking to death . You know ? Stopped breathing . Anyway ... it 's like nothing I ever saw before and I thought you might want to look at it . Jill , you 've got some kind Of infestation here . You have a serious bug problem . What ? Jill , there 's something in your closet . Open the door , Grace . Me ? It 's your house . When did you get a dog ? We don 't have a damn dog . I don 't think that 's a dog . It 's like a rodent . Or a muskrat or pig . - How the hell did it get in here ? - It doesn 't look too healthy . Well , it 's frightened . Oh , look , he can barely breathe , he 's so scared . Come on , cutie pie . Don 't be afraid . Come on , come on . That 's a good boy . Yes , 911 ? What the hell is that thing ? Thanks . Pick me up in an hour . No , two . Oh , an hour and a half would be good . Thanks . Hi . Do you have any messages for me ? Two single beds , please . We 're fighting . Ira , I 'm tired . I 've had two hours sleep and I 've got to take a shower . They 're spreading . You talking about the golf course ? Woodman sent a team there two hours ago . Well , it 's too bad you missed the five-foot amphibian dead in my lab . They 're adapting . We gotta shut it down . You 're overreacting . We can handle this . I used to be arrogant like you . We 're both aware of what that led to . Take me seriously , Allison . I do take you seriously . Then you gotta talk to Woodman , 'cause he won 't listen to me . We gotta kill these things while we still can . All right . I 'll discuss it with him , but I can 't promise you anything . Thank you . - Just one more thing . - Yeah ? Do you think you could ever be attracted to me ? Bye , Ira . It 's just food for thought . Yeah , she 's mine . I 've been an adjunct professor for four years ... but I 'm hoping this alien brouhaha will net me an honorary doctorate . You gonna finish that bacon ? Yeah , I 'm gonna finish it . I ordered it , didn 't I ? So about the coaching girls ' volleyball ? Do you ever get to see them take showers ? Yeah , all the time . Sometimes I shower with them . You 're kidding , right ? - So ? - She 's gonna talk to Woodman . Ah , thank goodness . I 'm okay . Level with me . Is there some sort of alien attack happening here ? We don 't know . Excuse me , could I borrow your cream ? Hi , Denise . Hello , Ira . Still setting the world on fire ? Ow . That 's Ira 's ex sitting with the cop . What 's with the police escort ? You 're not under arrest . I don 't see handcuffs . That 's funny . This is my friend , Sam . He 's about to make detective . I know Sam . We go way back . Congratulations . Maybe you could look into my missing shirts . She left with some of my shirts . See what I mean ? I 'm not up on the law ... but is it against the law when you leave somebody 's house with what they own ? You want your shirt ? Seriously , take it . You must be cold , right ? Are you cold ? Is that it ? Why should I get to wear the shirt when it 's your shirt ? It 's amazing how many women open their shirt to him . I 'm sure he 'll let you borrow the shirt For just today . Right , Professor ? We got a code 12-72 in Valley Vista . 12-72 ? That 's an animal attack . 10-99 responding . - Gotta go , babe . - Now ? They 're calling . Wait . Be careful . - You 'll take care of the check , right ? - Yeah . I want those shirts back , Denise . Hey , you gotta admit ... this animal attack has an ominous feel to it . Check it out ? - Check it out . - All right ! We 're under the microscope so let 's be systematic and subtle in what we do . - No cowboy stuff , okay ? - Professionals . Officer Johnson . - Fellas , why are you here ? - We heard about the animal attack . And part of our job with the Health Department ... is to ascertain if there 's any health risk . You know what ? No . Not this time . Forget about it . - You touch it with your bare hands ? - That would be a serious no-no . - You did ? He touched it . - That 's not good . - What do we do ? - I don 't know . Okay , why don 't you guys come in and take a look ? I 'll be checking things out around here in this vicinity . This dog is all ass . Ira , look at this , man . He would have come from in here , right ? It 's just used for storage and access under the house . Looks like he crawled right through the dirt there . Hey , guys . I was conducting a parameter check ... and there 's something you 'd better see . You liked that thing , you 're gonna love this . What is it ? Great googa-mooga ! What 'd I tell you ? They 're crawling out . They 're trying to breathe in our atmosphere . Fortunately , they haven 't been able to adapt yet . Hey , Ira , I think I know how these things got here . How ? Well , this entire area ... is a honeycomb of caves and old mine shafts . If memory serves , the Moenave cave system ... starts a few miles from here , west of the golf course . Runs into the foothills , continues to the Kaibab plateau and into Lake Powell . Our cave is smack dab in the middle of the system . It 's all connected . - Could you repeat that ? - I 'm impressed . Hey , beneath this calm , sexy exterior beats the heart of a true scientist . Whoa , guys ! That one 's moving . What the hell is it doing ? It 's trying to breathe . That 's like a big loogie ! Mazel tov . It 's a boy . It 's oxygen tolerant . It 's flying away . Is that a bad thing ? Only if you 're a human being . You know how much I hate shopping . We need to find you something nice for Thanksgiving . I got enough clothes . Tony , that color 's great on you . Whoa . This might be the place . Ever used one of these before ? Just ' cause I 'm a school teacher , don 't make me a pussy . Ladies , a flying extraterrestrial 's in the store . Can we focus ? I 'm in here . Just a minute . Just a second , please . I said , just a second , bitch ! How 'd you like me to scratch the eyes out of your skull ? Here , birdy-birdy-birdy . Birdy ! All right . If I was a giant , nasty alien bird in a department store , where would I be ? Lingerie . - Not you , the bird . - Lingerie . Help ! You go low . I 'm going high . Got it . We 'll never find it . I lost him ! How do you lose a 20-foot bird in the mall ? Ira , I don 't know . What do we do now ? We 've established that " ca-caw , ca-caw " and " tookie-tookie " don 't work . Right . Sorry . What do you say , Ira ? Pack it in ? You are So beautiful to me Step back , Harry . I 'm gonna shoot him . Stand down . I 'm gonna kill this one myself . Give me a chance . I 'm communicating here . You are so beautiful Tome Wayne , would you please stop , because you are embarrassing me . Can 't you see You 're every- - You 're everything that I hope for It 's working . Yeah , sing , sing . Rub some funk on it . And you 're everything I need Here he comes ! - Grab the girl . I 'll get the bird . - Got it ! All right ! Nice shot . I 'm sorry . I swear to God I will never shoplift again . Good . So what do you want ? Light meat or dark ? You have to ask ? It 's dead now . Yeah . Got to start to feelin ' so low And I decided quickly Yes , I did To disco down and check out the show Yeah , they were dancin ' and singin And movin ' to the groovin And just when it hit me Somebody turned around and shouted Play that funky music , white boy Play that funky music right I 'm standing at the edge of the Valley Vista housing community ... where just below me there are dozens of giant , odd-looking dead creatures . We should stress to our viewers that we have received no official word from- - I saw this ugly tentacle thing come out of the ground . It tried to grab my private parts . Batted it away . Got my hand . An atmosphere of anxiety and confusion in the greater Glen Canyon area . We stand outside the state capitol building ... awaiting comment from the governor 's office about the nature and origin ... of these extraordinary creatures . Governor Lewis , this way . Why was I not informed that we have aliens crawling over my beloved state ? I 've got 400 media vultures outside my office who know more about this than I. I ought to throw all of you in prison . Not that cushy federal place with the loose jumpsuits . State prison , with the crotch binders ! I 'm sorry , but there were security breaches made by Dr. Kane and his team . Wait a minute . No , no . Excuse me . That 's not exactly true , General Woodman . I believe the Governor 's question was directed at me , Dr. Reed . Put a plug in it . I 'm not interested in your bureaucratic crapola . What I really want to know is how bad this thing is . It 's bad , Governor . The new ground sensors and the satellite thermal scans ... indicate a potential problem . I don 't know how to read this ! What problem ? Somebody , please , take this ugly bag of snakes and lay them out straight . - Allow me . - You are- - Dr. Allison Reed . How do you do ? Carla , would you mind The red markings indicate the growth of the alien ecosystem . Unless we do something immediately , we will lose Glen Canyon in three days . Great merciful Christ . In a week , the rest of Arizona . Then the entire Southwest . In two months , the United States officially belongs to them . And we are extinct . You 're shittin ' me ! Come on , admit it . You 're glad to see us , huh ? I , for one , am glad to see you . Call the MP 's . Have them arrested . Hey , we just blew a giant alien bird out of a department store . We 're covering up your mess . Governor , Dr. Ira Kane . I 'm chairman of the science department at the college . My associate . Harry Phineas Block , adjunct professor of geology . Voted for you . Wayne Grey . Took some chemistry in high school . You two gentlemen are the original discovers of the phenomena , correct ? Yes , they are . And they 're also responsible for the mess we 're in now . - Here we go . - What ? They broke into the contained area and breached our safety procedures . Causing the dissemination of alien organisms outside the secured area . - Liar , liar , pants on fire ! - Criminal charges are in order here . This is bullshit ! Shut up ! Listen . My state is being overrun by vicious aliens . You 're all supposed to be the experts . I want to know right now . How the hell are you supposed to deal with this ? This is an outline of the infected area as of this afternoon . Governor , my plan ... is to evacuate everyone from within five miles of the perimeter . Evacuation ? You 're talking about 10,000 people . Yes , sir . We evacuate , make it safe ... and then burn the alien menace the hell out of there . With what ? With napalm . Lots and lots of napalm . Napalm ? Why don 't you just nuke them while you 're at it ? What about nukes ? Pull your horns in , boys . Nobody 's dropping an H-bomb on my state . All this talk about napalm and burning things makes me very damn nervous . It should . We don 't know their reaction to such an attack on a cellular level . Governor , it is time for a military solution . This will work . General , sorry to interrupt . You better take a look at this . What ? Clear out . What ? You called me out for this ? Sir , one of the creatures destroyed video four . What 's going on there ? My God ! They 've evolved into primates . That 's a face for radio . They took out six and seven . All the monitors are down . That can 't be good . That 's the elevator . We have no personnel down there . They breached the air lock . The no-nose chimp ? Call for backup . We need backup ! They 're going through the elevator ! Cover the elevator ! Stay back behind me . Get the hell off me ! I want to see this thing ! Be prepared to fire . It 's empty , sir . The governor ! - Do something ! - Hold your fire ! You 'll get somebody killed . Nice shot . I 'll take that now . You have my full support to do whatever you need to do , however much firepower . You can melt the place to beaded glass if that 's what it takes . Just get these hell-blown creazoids out of my state ! Thank you , Governor . I 'll be ready to go by noon tomorrow . Good . - Where have you two been ? - I was getting out of the way . Get me out of here . Science project 's over . I want you and your people gone . - Soldier , escort these men out . - Yes , sir . Don 't you have work to do ? You are such an asshole . When a woman expresses anger , it 's often because- - Shut up , Flemming . Okay , I know where the car is . Wipe my ass too ? Hey , guys ? Got room for one more ? Hell , yeah . Who wants to be deputy director anyway ? The real money 's in the private sector . - Are you sure about this ? - Oh , yeah . Listen , it may not seem like much , but I got your research files and samples . So , if we survive this , you guys will get the credit . Thank you . - It 's nothing . - No , thank- - Let me get this . - No , I got it . - All right . Sorry . Excuse me . We haven 't been formally introduced yet . I 'm Wayne Grey . - Oh , hey , I 'm kinda with him . - Oh , that 's cool . Buckle up , Allison . We 're rolling . Okay . Oh , goodness ! Facilities are being provided for you and your families . Please move in an orderly fashion to the safe zone . They 're gonna blow up the whole town . Attention . We need to clear this area . For your own safety , evacuate immediately . Can you make a beer run ? - Professor Kane ! - Arizona is going down , baby ! This may not be the best time for you boys to be drinking . I was your first . We discovered you in that cave . You were scared and alone . It was just you , me and Harry in the beginning . Those were good times . Why don 't you level with me ? You can trust me . Talk to me . Just tell me the secret . Tell me the answer . Tell me how to kill you ! You are losing it , pal . What is that stuff ? Some of the original liquid material from inside the meteor . - Why hasn 't it evolved like the rest ? - I don 't know . Maybe because it was refrigerated ... was locked in an airtight case , didn 't have anything to metabolize with . But regardless , that doesn 't give us any clues to- - When did you start smoking ? Not much of a point to clean living anymore . Whoa ! These things react to fire like it was Miracle-Gro . Fire . The organisms were dormant in space and then collided with Earth 's atmosphere . And bam ! Heat . Fire . That 's the catalyst . So if a little match catalyzes this stuff , what 's a ton of napalm gonna do ? So much for the military option . Call that dick general . That 's a lot of napalm . Yes , it is . We 're going to blow those damn creatures straight to hell . We 'll flush them out along the mine shafts ... then mop up the edges as they run trying to escape the flames . Excuse me , General . There 's an urgent call from Dr. Reed . She says she has important information about the mission . Really ? Well , unfortunately , I 'm not available . Anything more ? No , sir . He blew me off . Can you believe it ? That bastard wouldn 't even take my call . You did call him an asshole . - Hey , Dr. K. Time to party . - We got beer . - I 'll take one . - Me too . I just quit smoking . What are you boys doing here ? We thought you could use a brewski to mellow out . Kick back and chill . Have a beer , relax . It 's gonna help you with your research . Whoa ! Look at that thing ! Whoa ! Can we have that when you guys are done with it ? Fellas , thank you for your help and the beers , but we 're working . Hold it . Hold it . - Look at that . - What are you doing ? Selenium . That could be the answer . I 'm looking at the Periodic Table on your T-shirt and I see this pattern . - Take off your shirt . I 'll show you . - Yes ! No , I don 't think so . We are a carbon based life-form . Keep pulling , Dr. K. We move down here , and you 've found our poison : arsenic . But the aliens are nitrogen based , right ? You make the same move down and over ... and where do you find yourself ? - Selenium . - Selenium . Could be as lethal to them as arsenic is to us . And with their metabolic rates , it 'll kill them fast . Selenium . How much do we need ? Five hundred gallons could do it , should do it . Five hundred gallons ? Um , I hate to be a buzzkill , but where are we gonna get that at 2 : 00 a.m. ? No problem . Yeah , we can get that . Head Shoulders . The dandruff shampoo ? Yeah , that 's the stuff . The active ingredient is selenium sulfide . How do you know that ? You don 't know anything . Haven 't you noticed how shiny and fake-free our hair is ? Okay , this is the best idea we got . Let 's give it a shot . Come on . Let 's do it ! Yeah ! We 'll get the troops together . We 're getting shampoo ! I 've got the vehicle . Good ! Donalds , you just got your A 's . Yes ! Almost full . There 's something I feel I should tell you , but I don 't know exactly how . Just say it . We 're adults and we 're all about to die a very horrible death . So ? I would 've rocked your world . - You already have . - We 're full ! Battle stations ! Lock and load ! - Can we continue this discussion later ? - Yes . Let 's do this ! Let 's shampoo us some aliens ! Lots of soldiers around . There 's an abandoned mine half a click south of here . We can sneak in there . Half a click ? What are you , in Vietnam ? Hey , I 'm digging this . Work with me , baby . It 's over here ! It 's right here ! - You okay ? - I 'm good . I 'm good . - Let 's go ! - Let 's do this ! You sure this leads to the main cavern ? It 'll lead us somewhere . Geology 's not an exact science . Where are you ? Where are you , my little aliens ? Show yourself . Warm to the touch . Highly acidic . We do not have time for you to act like you know what you 're doing . - What happened to the respect ? - Woodman 's going at noon . Hurry . Very good . - Are the troops in place ? - They 're ahead of schedule . Excellent . We can go early . Oh , no . What is he doing here ? Governor Lewis . I don 't see anything burning . Where are all the explosions ? We 're just getting underway . Didn 't know you were coming to see the show . You damn well better make it a good one , Sergeant . That 's General . Not if you screw this up . Keeping my chair warm for me ? Thank you . I 'll take a pair of spy glasses and a hot chocolate . Give me a hose . Get up top . When I give you the signal , start pumping the selenium . Got it . Okay , we 're gonna spray all around the meteor , then get out of here fast . Oh , blue monkey ! Wayne , charge the line now ! - That 's the napalm ! - Woodman went early ! Bad , bad , bad , bad ! Wayne , come on ! Okay , I 'm out ! Oh ! We gotta go ! Go ! Go , go ! Faster ! Get up there ! - Go ! - Run for your life ! Quite the bonfire , General Woodman . Should 've brought some wieners . That can be arranged . - First reports are excellent , sir . - Very good . Keep it together , Wayne . Keep it together . Oh , my God . What 's happening ? - It 's coming ! - What 's coming ? Get outta here ! General , look . Hurry ! Drive ! Go ! Go ! Fall back . Fall back ! What the hell is that thing ? The napalm forced an evolutionary response , just like the match . That 's evolution ? Survival of the fittest . Often the simplest organism is the strongest . It 's freaking out . It 's starting to have some sort of spaz attack . No , that 's not spazzing out . It 's getting ready to divide . Mitosis . Wait . There 's gonna be more of these things ? Yeah , a lot more . Its cycle 's starting over again . It 's gonna go on growing ... and doubling until it takes over . Yeah , but we were here first . So that Head Shoulders idea , is that still the plan or what ? I 'm driving . I don 't care if he 's on Air Force One . They 've got phones . I 've seen them ! I don 't think this is gonna wait an hour . Hey , what 's that fire truck doing out there ? Mama . Can you believe this ? We gotta find a point of attack . There ! Nasty ! Allison , stop , stop . Right here . - Here we go ! - Get the ladder up ! Feed me the hose , Deke ! - What are you doing ? - Going up top . Not before me . I 've got a major score to settle . Go , go ! We don 't have much time . Hurry ! - Left ! - Left ! All right , I got it . I haven 't had too much practice with this thing . Stop ! Stop ! - What 's going on ? - I don 't know , but it 's getting bigger . What the hell are those guys doing with that ladder ? Looks like they 're getting ready to administer a jumbo enema . We got one shot . Let 's do this . It 's payback time ! Keep it in there ! What 's it look like I 'm doing ? It 's working ! - Shit ! - Whoa ! What the hell ? Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Give me back my friend , you big sphincter ! She 's gonna blow ! Stop kicking ! It 's horrible in here ! I got you ! - Please . Hold me . - I got you ! Don 't let me go ! We gotta get outta here . This thing 's gonna blow . You cannot imagine what I 've seen in there . Hurry up , guys ! Ira , don 't you ever tell anyone where I 've been . Dear Lord ! Uh-oh . Time to go . - Go ! - Go ! Whoa ! We did it ! Here we go , sir . Just relax , and we 'll have you just as good as new . I am happy to report that absolutely all remaining traces ... of the alien menace have been eradicated ... using the selenium shampoo formula developed right here . Now let me introduce our civilian scientist heroes and their team . The best that the great state of Arizona has been privileged to produce . So , this is your moment . You wouldn 't want to miss this for anything , huh ? Firstly , I would like you all to meet Wayne Grey . As of today , fully credentialed firefighter . I spoke to the chief . Oh , thanks , Governor . Now our next hero , Professor Harry Block , noted geologist ... and the winningest coach in North Arizona 's women 's volleyball . I appreciate that , Governor . Very kind . First of all , let 's give it up to God . With Him , all things are possible . Basically , we just played tough defense , took it one alien at a time ... and we were able to come away with the big W. Thank you . Finally ... Doctors Ira Kane and Allison Reed ... whose tireless efforts and research and academic findings led to the- - I think he 's giving her a bit of the Kane Madness . Wow ! Fighting the alien menace can be tough work . And so is keeping your hair clean , shiny and dandruff-free . So it 's a good thing that we always keep a healthy supply of- -

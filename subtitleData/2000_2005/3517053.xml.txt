 I 'm here to meet someone . Michael Jennings . - Have a seat . - Thanks . Sit at that table right there . In the seat , with your back to the window . Michael , thank God you 're all right . I thought I was never gonna see you again . Michael , it 's me . Rachel . Look ... You can 't remember me . No . I 'm sorry . Cops . We can 't go in . I 'll have to wait for a clear shot . Maya , stall for time . Tell him you thought he 'd remember something . That you two were engaged . I guess I thought you 'd remember something . We 've been together for three years . I don 't know what to say . I 'm really sorry . I 'm trying . That 's how he 's doing this . Listen to me very carefully , Maya . This is what I want you to say . Michael , I can see you still have the envelope . That means it 's working . I know you switched the personal items . I helped . - You left me a note on a mirror . - You left me a note on a mirror . I 'm supposed to take something . Something I can use to get to Stevens . - He 's a man you worked with . - He 's a man you worked with . He 's trying to fix the machine . Work backwards , Michael . Yeah . Take the swipe card . That 's the swipe card for the campus . You 're supposed to give that to me . Rachel wouldn 't be hurt if he hesitated , she 'd be impatient . Look , Michael , if you can 't trust me right now , then we are lost . For good . Nice . OK . I 'd better get back . They 'll get suspicious soon . Wait here . I 'll be back in half an hour . And don 't worry , we end up together . Michael ... I love you . - What 's my favourite baseball team ? - What ? What 's my favourite baseball team ? Who cares ? That would be the Red Sox . - I think maybe we should go . - Wait ! Now we can leave . Come on . Wait ! Hold on . - You have a car ? - I might . You might ? Look for a BMW ! You gotta be joking . Shit ! Shit ! - Let me see that key . - Why ? You 're in the wrong section . Jennings bought the BMW on the Internet . He had the key mailed to him four weeks ago . - What 's the colour of his car ? - It isn 't a car . They just turned on Pine . Intercept them on Sixth . - How good am I on this thing ? - You 're OK ! - Look , I just said you 're OK , OK ? - OK . Hang on ! - Report of shots . Southgate BMW . - Got it . Stop ! I lost the envelope ! - I 'll come back and get you . - See you ! Got it ! Let 's get out of here . Take us down ! Mike , we can help you ! We know what 's going on ! Let us bring you in ! He 's headed for the tunnel ! Cut him off ! Cut him off ! Duck ! Split ! You think Jennings foresaw that ? Maybe next time he 'll see a nice quiet stakeout . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . It 's OK . It 's all for you anyway . And I ... I brought you some clothes . I thought you might need them . I hope it 's OK . Thank you . These are mine ? You don 't remember ? No . You don 't remember me , do you ? Well ... These are for you . Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you You 're so sweet . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I just don 't remember . I shouldn 't have left . You 're saying he sent himself a different set of personal items after using the machine , and nothing our security would flag . Everyday things combined with the power of foresight transform Michael from engineer to escape artist . I don 't know about you , but I 'd like to return the favour . Michael , are you OK ? I 'm all right . Michael , I don 't know what you saw in your machine , but I remember , a few weeks ago , you came back from your lab , pale . You asked me the strangest question . - What ? - If I knew it wouldn 't work out for you and I , before we were together , would I have done it ? What did you say ? That I wouldn 't trade our time for anything . That 's all we are , the sum of our experiences . Besides , some of the best things in life are total mistakes . - What ? - You know , when I checked this envelope out , they told me I signed in 20 items , but there were only 19 . I don 't understand . What are these pictures of ? Michael , look at the rest of the pictures . Look at the last one . Oh , my God . It 's the future . The machine predicts a war , and we go to war to avert it . It predicts a plague . We herd all the sick together , create a plague . Whatever future this predicts , we make happen . We give over control of our lives completely . I did this . Seeing the future will destroy us . If you show someone their future , they have no future . If you take away the mystery , you take away hope . I have to go back . I have to destroy that machine . It 's impossible . The campus is huge . There are hundreds of guards . I wouldn 't have given up the three years we had unless I was sure I could get us 50 more . OK . So how do we get in ? - We don 't . - You said everything was happening for a reason , and that includes me being here . So come on . Hey , Rachel . Another day at the most . I don 't have many places to look . I guess you weren 't as smart as you thought , Stevens . Hey , Jennings wouldn 't find it any faster unless he knew where to look . We 've got the feeds from mass transit . - He could be anywhere by now . - Except he 's not running away . He could 've given himself a way to disappear , but look what he gave himself instead . His Allcom security pass . He 's going back . Get a warrant to tap phone and data lines coming out of Allcom . Put some bodies on that campus . I want that machine ! Jennings and the girl were spotted . What do you want me to do ? Nothing . - Stay where you are . - Nobody gets through ! - Sir ! - I didn 't do anything ! Settle down ! All the metal detectors on level four just went off . Ball bearings . Just down the hall from the metal detectors . Pull the guards off the Jennings lab . Let him slip in , think he 's fooled us . Once he 's fixed the machine , take him . I built this . This door shouldn 't be open . There 's something wrong . They 're expecting us . Better close this door behind us . And keep it shut . - He 's in . - Confirmed . He 's in . Once we confirm he 's at the machine , let 's go after him . I thought we were gonna wait for him to come out . I can 't wait ! Jennings or the machine , I don 't care , as long as I get one . Let 's go ! This will do . Watch out . - What are you doing ? - Smashing the lock . Hold on a second . You can 't just smash the thing . They 'll still be able to get in . We gotta jam the outside reader . Let 's go . Let 's take a look at the future before we destroy this thing . I bugged it . I rigged it so Jimmy wouldn 't use it against me . Then you can fix it , right ? Now , where would I have planted that bug ? Maybe on one of the motherboards . Whoa , whoa , whoa , we won 't be needing this , OK ? You 're dangerous with that thing . You must have given yourself something to help you find it . The only things left are the bullet and ... this . - Crossword ? - Yeah . Look at this . Twelve down . Maybe it 's here . Nine , ten , eleven , twelve . Let 's take a look . Maybe it 's a circuit diagram . I wouldn 't have put it in the primary path . Twelve down . Take him . OK , corridor three , sublevel A , Jennings ' lab . All right , let 's put this thing to good use one last time . Let 's get us out of here . That 's in the lab . It 's the catwalk . Look , I 've changed my future before using this thing . I can do it again . Don 't have time . Gotta destroy this before they get it . Reprogram the door to Jennings ' lab , please . Now . He must 've done something to the controller . - How are we gonna get out of here ? - I don 't know . Clear ! - What are you doing ? - These are liquid hydrogen . They 're used to cool the machine . They fire in order . Number one just fired . When it gets down to number six here , that 's all she wrote . I 'll see you when this goes off , Jimmy . Come on ! You see ? You judge too soon . They went out through the vent . Spread out , find them . Position three standing by . Come on . Freeze ! Look out . Seal off all exits to the lab . All right , Jennings , let 's see what you 've been up to . Rachel , go for the door , OK ? Drop the gun . Drop the gun . Looks like Michael 's got a date on the catwalks . Let 's make sure he makes it . - Let 's go . - We can 't take the catwalk . I know . We won 't , I promise . Come on , let 's go . - Michael ! What are you doing ? - Go . I 'll distract them . - Go , please . - No ! Listen to me . This is my debt . I built this machine . - I have to pay for it . - You come with me now ! You promised you 'd change your fate ! Please , we don 't have time . If you love me , if you care about me , go . Have a good life . Remember me . Damn you . Jimmy . You want to kill me , come do it yourself . Here I am . You want me ? Come get me . - Hi , Jimmy . - Hi , Mike . - Looks like this is it , huh ? - It is , Mike . - You only have yourself to blame . - That 's a lie . You can 't change your fate . You 're gonna die today . Maybe . But you 're not going to kill me . That 's right , Mike . I 've seen the future . Still think you can change your fate , Mike ? I am the future , Mike ! - Rethrick has Jennings . - Retire him . - What ? - We have the machine . We can 't risk its creator falling into the wrong hands . Come on . Don 't blame me . You and Michael would 've lived happily ever after , no memory wipe . He saw something he didn 't like . He 's the one who decided he wanted to stop the program . Look at it this way , you did change the future , Michael . Before you interfered you both would 've lived and we would still be friends , instead of ending up like this . It wasn 't meant to be . Giving up so easy ? Don 't you believe in second chances ? To tell you the truth , I do . Go , go , go . Rachel ! Let 's go . Look . Any records ? Any papers ? Explosion destroyed everything . - Are we trying to salvage that or what ? - I guess we don 't get the machine . Any sign of Jennings ? No , I 'm afraid he didn 't make it . What was Shorty thinking , starting a nursery ? I mean , these plants are on life-support . What do you mean ? Really ? He told me he had a green thumb . Gangrene is more like it . Lucky for Shorty , I 'm a biologist . Lucky for both of us , since I failed biology , - I 'm no help to either one of you . - So you say . Too bad , though , because I 'm looking for a partner - for a start-up company . - Really ? Doing what ? We 're gonna save the world . I don 't think I 'm your guy . But would you settle for someone who wants to help you change it ? - OK . - Good . So how does it end for us , Michael ? I mean , what 's in our future ? You know , I don 't know . I kind of like it that way . - I do know one thing . - What 's that ? I never want to forget anything ever again . Break it up , break it up . The birdman cometh . - Shorty . - It 's dinner . - You found them . - Yes , I did . - Who does everything for everybody ? - You do . - You 're right . - You 're my hero . Thank you very much . - You hear that ? I 'm a hero . - That 's great . I think I remember . Are those our birds ? Yes , of course they are . We bought them together . You remember the birds ? Well done . You could see into the future and all you remember are Polly and Tweety there . Why not remember something that 'd make us rich ? - Wait a second . - What is it ? - I think there was something else . - No , no , no . The envelope 's empty . Don 't worry about it . Hold on . I 'm working backward here . " If you only look where you can 't go , you will miss the riches below . " I must 've known you 'd never get rid of these birds . Of course not . They 're family . So I knew this would be here . What only looks where it can 't go ? A caged bird . " You will miss the riches below . " The riches below . What is that ? Well , that 's a $ 90-million lottery ticket . - Wait . Wait a minute . - It 's $ 90 million . - Nice . - Yes , I 'm proud of it . Wait a minute . No . - Wait . - What are you doing ? You know what ? I think now 's a good time to discuss my commission , 33 % . - I thought it was 5 . - No , 33 . - Thirty-three percent ! - He deserves it . It was found on my premises . I 'll get back to you . I 'm gonna cash this in .

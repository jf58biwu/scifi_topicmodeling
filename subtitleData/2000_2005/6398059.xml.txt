 Just keep going . Follow the Nexus Coordinates . But we 've been following them for three solar days . Just follow them , Pilot . Or do I have to take over manual command ? - Zhaan , maybe ... Go away , Crichton . All right , look , we 've all been talking . We think maybe we should turn back . No . When Stark communicated with me , he insisted that we follow the Nexus Coordinates . If we do what he says , he will be there . There 's nothing out there , okay ? Aeryn has gone and done the long range recon ... We should return to the slave auction immediately . And do what ? We have no currency , D 'Argo . We cannot save your son . But we can save Stark . Zhaan , maybe , uh ... What ? Well , maybe I 'm ... I 'm just saying maybe you didn 't communicate with Stark . You know , Zhaan , sometimes when we want something really badly , we think things happen when they don 't . I do not need a lesson from you , child . This mask talked to me . Unless you all think I 'm imagining it . I do . Stark is gone , but my son is still alive . So I want you to turn this ship around . Crichton , do you also believe I am imagining my communication with Stark ? Bluey , since we 've been together you 've shown me some pretty wacky things . But it 's been three days , and D 'Argo 's son ... Don 't give up . Don 't stop , Zhaan . Hurry . I 'm dying . Moya 's found something . There 's a ship directly in front of us . Stark ! Moya 's sensors are picking up one being . Maneuver close and deploy the docking web . The life is faint , Crichton . We have to reach him quickly . He 's barely breathing . This is impossible . We saw him die . Well , let 's get him to Zhaan before he dies again . D 'Argo ! D 'Argo , I 've done it . I 've found it . I know how to save your son . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . A radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship , a living ship , full of strange alien life-forms . Help me . Listen , please . Is there anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm being hunted by an insane military commander . I 'm doing everything I can . I 'm just looking for a way home . It 's all here , D 'Argo . Everything , everything . - Be calm , Stark . Be calm . What is this dren ? How will it help me save my son ? I 've got a plan , a plan to ... Shh ! Stark , your life signs are still weak . Just let him talk . Hang on . Before we hear about any plan , inquiring minds want to know how the hell did you get here ? I stole a ship . No , on the hubcap . You were executed . You were dispersed . Crichton , this body is only a ... a molecular creation . Which enables me to live in your realm . It 's merely a ... a vessel for my true incorporeal self . You want to run that by me one more time ? When I dispersed , I instantly traveled to locate these plans and blueprints . And then I ... I reconstituted the shell of this body , and ... and stole a ship to come find you . I told you he was still alive . I don 't believe it . Zhaan was telling the truth , I ... Go on , Stark . Ka D 'Argo , your son is being sold in a lot of 10,000 slaves . Now , this is a blueprint for a depository . What , you mean like a bank ? Yes . - Are we gonna rob a bank ? Yes ! Steal other people 's currency to help ourselves ? We can 't do that , I can 't . Well , sure you can . Zhaan , it is not a normal depository . It is one that services only criminals who wish to hide what they have stolen from others . Wait a microt . Are you talking about a shadow depository ? Yes , and it 's within the range of a Transport Pod from here . Hmm . So you are insane . Well , I saw a shadow depository once that had more firepower than a Gammak Base . Yes , but with these I can control the internal depository door motion detectors . And these ... these are a complete set of blueprints . Vault layout , everything . In one container is enough wealth to buy the entire shipment of slaves and still have enough left over to make all of us filthy rich forever . Where did you get these ? I helped the deposit designer cross over to death . His last thoughts led me to these . They 're genuine . Did you kill him ? Not exactly . Did the designer have enough time to explain to you how much firepower is actually inside this depository ? Not ... not precisely . Oh , that 's comforting . We 're going to have to go down and have a look for ourselves . - Their arsenal would be massive . - This is suicide , D 'Argo . Well , it 's the only way we can save my son . We must consider it . D 'Argo , wait . No , no , no . I know this is important . I know you want to do this but it is not possible . You won 't even consider this ? I just don 't see how we ... Well , fine ! We 'll go without you . We 'll go without all four of you . Chiana , it 's just you , me and Stark . Well sure Bubba , but you know , maybe ... maybe we should just ... - What ? You 're against me , too ? No , no , I 'm with you . It 's ... When you ask me to do something , did I ever question if it was possible ? D 'Argo , I ... - No , I didn 't . You cowards . All of you . He does not need my permission . Get him on the phone . He is not responding to any of my signals . D 'Argo ! - How much of a head start does he have ? He cleared Moya not more than 50 microts ago . - D 'Argo , pick up the damn phone . - I know you can hear me . D 'Argo ? ! - We 're taking the Prowler . That 's big . It 's very big . I suggest you take it , or your business will be no longer appreciated . - Don 't threaten me , Natira . - Don 't lose D 'Argo . And don 't forget who I am . I haven 't . You 're nobody here . But do as I say , and we 'll let the relationship unfold . Just , um ... What ? Scorpius . Where ? Over there . Talking to that weird , blue alien . That 's not Scorpius . You 're having visions again . Have a look . But that should be the least of your worries . See ? Sorry about that . And we 're worried about D 'Argo . Hand over your weapons ... slowly . What is your business here , Peacekeepers ? Good . Very , very good . - Clear , Akkor . You in charge here ? What is your business ? This is a depository , right ? We have something to deposit . What makes you think we 'd be interested ? You ever hear of KFC ? KFC ? It is , to my knowledge , unique in the universe . And unique is always valuable . Now we have managed to procure all 11 secret ingredients . What we need to do now is discuss the terms of ... - Security breach , portal five ! Guards ! The Luxan ! Seize him ! Get him on the ground . On the ground . - On the ground . Hold him ! Wait . I was told the security here was weak . - What for ? I was right . The security here is frelled . Silence ! As a race , Luxans can be inartful at love , inadequate at war and intrinsically inept . But this one , is intelligent . Shall I execute him ? No . He also expects to be interrogated . Don 't you ... Ka D 'Argo . See ? It 's a dance , gentlemen . Let 's not disappoint him . You went to so much trouble to open that door , Ka D 'Argo ... be my guest . It 's time to go . Aeryn . You ! You set him up . D 'Argo is down there because of you ! Look , you left him no choice ! He had to , had to . It 's the only way to save Jothee . It 's the plan ! What plan ? ! What are you talking about ? ! The plan , the plan to get D 'Argo back and to rob the depository . But you put the whole place on security alert ! It 's his ... it 's all part of the plan , you see ? Because D 'Argo 's breached the system , they 'll scramble their codes . And while they 're resetting their security codes , I can link in and they 'll never even know . But I have to work quickly . So you 'll leave me alone ! I 've only got six arns before they reset their codes . I 'm going to reset his codes . How the hell are we supposed to get D 'Argo back ? ! Don 't worry about a thing . I 've got it all figured out . It 's all part of the plan . You better have it all figured out . D 'Argo bet his life on that . No , he bet his son 's life on that . You manipulated us . This plan will work . He hasn 't said a word . He 's Luxan . He 'll die first . Which means all this pain has been for nothing . As it will continue to be . But perhaps you like pain . Is that it ? I hope so . I 've changed my mind . Seven percent isn 't nearly enough . I want ten . Listen slug , you 'll get what we agreed upon and you 'll be happy about it , okay ? Okay ? ! It 's easy , Rygel . Okay . Now , Stark 's gadget will switch our container for the valuable one . Mm-hmm . Oh ! And no Comms . - What ? All transmissions will be detected . But what if something goes wrong ? We have complete confidence in you , Rygel , especially where money is concerned . Chiana , swallow this . It will protect you from the effects of the melar gas . You ready , Rygel ? Do I look ready ? You have nothing to fear . The gas will suspend your biological functions just long enough to avoid being detected by a bioscan . Goddess be with you , brave Rygel . - Ten percent ! Do you hear me ? ! - Ten ! I consider this an oral contract ... Strange . It should have been instantaneous . I 'll have to adjust the mix next time . No , no , no ! Wrong chip ! Bad chip ! Bad ! Have you accessed their security systems yet ? Soon . You said we had less than six arns . I know what I said . That means you have less than an arn left . All bad . It 's a matter of precision and timing . I must create my link at the precise moment they reset their ... I 'm in . I 'm in . Are you sure this is going to work ? Yes , it 'll work . I spent too much time thinking it through . I spent too much time thinking through the Farscape project . Your side , my side ! My side , your side ! Now go away . You know , go back to your quarters . Get something to eat , take a nap . Do nothing . That 's what D 'Argo said you do best . Ground rules . You don 't lie to me . Did D 'Argo say that ? No . I 'm sorry . He didn 't . Do you have any other lies you wanna confess ? No . You wanna guilt trip me , that 's fine . Just ... don 't lie to me . Good . Good . This is it ? Huh , lame . We can do better . Better is whatever I say it is . I knew that . May I help you ? No . Bring me whoever 's in charge here . I assure you madam , I am more than capable ... Don 't elevate yourself . I know a functionary when one crawls in front of my face . Now fetch me your master like a good little minion . I 'm Natira . Are you here to make a transaction ? I am Orala . You act as if that name should mean something to me . I understand you 've been having security problems . You 've been misinformed . Oh , really ? I had one of my operatives test your systems himself . He got halfway into your vault before you even noticed him . The Luxan ? He barely made it through the first door . He belongs to you ? He 's still alive ? Last I checked . They couldn 't even kill a Luxan . Unbelievable . I will take him back now . You 'll take whatever I give you . Oh ... How did he get our code ? It is not my job to plug your security leak . Then why have you come here ? Time sensitive goods . Short term deposit . - Short term . I need storage for one solar day . - One solar day . Explosives , negative . Biologicals , negative . Power-field emitters , negative . Hynerian ? Yes . Naltoth era . Hmm , it 's extremely ugly . But priceless . And now my Luxan . This way , please . - Girl ? - Yes ? Take him back to the ship . - At once . Freakin ' Attila the Hun . Your guards can watch you from the observation room . He looks bad . Those are my rules , and if you don 't like them , then leave . Now . The vault is made from Maddium steel , strong enough to withstand a Meta-vek explosion . Does that alleviate your security concerns ? I 'll let you know in one solar day . Please . The code to your container is now linked to your genetic profile . - Retrieving container . - Only you will be able to gain access . Here comes your container now . The first time can be a little intimidating . Bonnie and Clyde . Oh no , forget about that one . It 's a bad ending . Scorpius is here . Natira should know . You know , it 's really not very nice to whisper . All right , Zhaan , come on . Come on . Wrap it up . - You can 't escape me . - You know that . Not now , you freak . Get out of my head . You can 't escape me . Scorpius . Yes , Scorpius . No ... Scorpius . You see him ? This is bad . This is very bad . Scorpius ? Scorpius ? Don 't talk . I 've come for my property . If you could just be a little patient . No ... No , no , no , no . I must see Natira now . Yes , but ... - You 're stalling me , Akkor . No . He 's about to walk in on Zhaan . We 'd better warn her . We can 't use the Comms because they 'll hear us . She 'll be right with you . Please , understand . Natira 's policy on client confidentiality is very strict . I could lose my position . Of course . Oh , I understand . Now it won 't be your fault . Okay ... All right . Hold still . What is that ? My boy Scorpius . He 's half Scarran . Got a hell of a heat problem . That must be how he stays cool . I trust your machinery will not damage my possessions . Come on , Zhaan . Quit your yakking and get out of there . Come on , Zhaan . ... far more fragile and valuable than yours . Scorpius is here . If you 'd allow my assistant to escort you . Natira ! Scorpius ! How good to see you . Follow me . I 'm here to claim my property . Is that it ? Straight to business ? Scorpius . For a half Scarran , you can sometimes be so ... cold . We have so much to catch up on . I heard about the destruction of your Gammak Base . And you thought I was dead . Well , I 'm glad I was wrong . You 've seized my property . Well ... of course . But I 'll provide you with merchandise of equal value . No . For my inconvenience , you 'll provide me ... with triple the value . Double . Triple . I 'll make the arrangements . Hey , Stark , riddle me this . What 's black and white and black and white and black and white ? Scorpy . And in the bank . Here ? You knew ! You knew that he had a safe deposit box in that bank . Oh , well ... - Uh-uh ! We 've talked about lying . Yes , I knew , but if I told you ... Hell , we would have stayed the hell away from the bank ! What the hell were you thinking ? I didn 't know he 'd be here . No , no , no , no , you just want to ... you want to boost , boost , boost his stuff ! You just wanted revenge ! That is not true ! My people and D 'Argo 's son are the reason I 'm here . Now , if it 's Scorpius 's wealth that frees them , well that 's an added bonus . You want revenge . No , I don 't . I want to kill him . That 's justice . How 's D 'Argo ? Recovering . Pilot , is there any sign of Scorpius 's Command Carrier ? None . But Moya did sense one small vessel approaching the planet earlier . Oh , that 's fine . That 's probably just a Marauder on a stealth trajectory . There 's no need to panic . We can still pull this off undetected . Look , I 've modified these Comms so that they 'll encrypt all transmissions . We can communicate safely at all times . And this pass key has been calibrated to control all their doors . You see , this plan will work . In any event , we 're committed . I need one more thing . Zhaan ? Yes , John ? Can you concoct something for me that reacts with heat , and by react I mean explode ? I can prepare some jelifan paste . Do that , please . Don 't turn this into a vendetta , John . I didn 't . I 'm procuring a quarter sakmar of Borinium ingots for you . At least three times the value of the property you had stored . And where are you stealing them from ? Do you care ? - No . How soon will we have them ? The arrangements are rather complex . And what am I supposed to do while I wait ? Accept my apologies . Return to the Marauder . I will summon you if I need you . Leave that . Natira will tend to me , should I require it . True . I know many ways to bleed off your excess heat . How you doing ? How do I look ? You look like crap . Well , there 's your answer . Blood 's clear . Not much damage . He 's still in a lot of pain , though . Yeah , we 're , uh ... we 're going ahead with the plan . Because now it 's begun , you have no other choice . Now , who exactly got us into this great plan , anyway ? Well someone had to act . You mean someone had to take matters into their own hands ? What , and you never do ? Crichton , just ... just leave him alone , okay . No , it 's fine . If he wants to get into it , we can get into it . Well yeah , sure . Now 's just a great time . Hey , how about I just go grab some rags in case he starts bleeding again . I didn 't come here to fight . I came to see how you are . Well , we 've already covered that . Is there anything else ? One , get out of statue . Two , use gadget to retrieve prize . Three , jump into containers full of riches . The problem is ... step one ! Frell ! The blue bitch said this would be easy . Withdraw your possessions already ? Mm-hmm . That 's unusual . My life is unusual . Very unusual . I said this was a short term deposit . Short term . Dren ! No Dominar should have to work this hard . All right , let 's see if this thing actually works . So far , we 're right on schedule . Let 's hope Rygel is . All he 's got to do is switch containers . He gets it right , I got one big kiss for him . What are you doing ? Doing what guys do best . I 'm looking for Baywatch . Better yet , the Discovery Channel . Are you still angry with me ? Mmm , furious . Good . It adds enthusiasm to our encounters . Leave the cooling rods . Leave the cooling rods . Leave ' em . Perfect ! Come on . Crichton ... - Let 's go . Retrieving container . Ho , ho , ho , ho , ho . Hello , John . Go . Go away . You , move that over there . Oh ! Careful . Go away . Go . I cannot let you do this ! - Go away . Go away . Shh . It 's just Scorpius . He 's in my ear . How about some jelifan paste ... Put it down . - In his ear ? Stop it . Stop that . Put it down . Get out . Shut up . Put it down , John . - I can do this . Put it down . I can 't let you do this . - I can do ... I can do this . No , John , I won 't let you . I won 't let you . No , you can 't . Give it to me . Come on , Aeryn . Come on , come on , come on . All right , all right , all right . Aeryn , Aeryn , quick . Okay . Pick it up , pick it up , pick it up . Come on , come on , come on . Get down . The Borinium ingots have been transferred into your container . You 'll be pleased with their value . I 'd better be similarly pleased with their quantity . I will not be late for my Taladine tea . You want to push ? We 'll be aboard the transport shortly , Orala . Borinium ingots ? The Delvian woman . These are her possessions . A Delvian ? - Security lockdown . Who was with her ? A Nebari , a Luxan and two Sebaceans . Crichton ! Seal all exits ! Frell ! Frell . Time to try Stark 's lockpick . Nuh , time to try something else . Zhaan . Zhaan ! Zhaan ! Get away from the portal . The doors are sealed , Aeryn . What 's happening ? Scorpius must be on to us . Stupid plan . Very stupid plan . Don 't panic . Hold your position . Do we have a choice ? Stark ? Stark ! Pick up ! I want him captured , not deafened . This facility is bristule tight . They won 't get out . I have less than a skerrick of faith in your words , Natila . Locate them now . This wasn 't supposed to happen . Wasn 't supposed to happen . Yes , well it did . Now , can you pinpoint our location and turn off the damn camera ? I 'm here . What the frell ? ! They 're jamming the cameras . Give me your level , corridor , segment , in that order . Stark , this gizmo you gave me . It 's supposed to give me control over all the doors . Yes . Yes , but they 'll know right where you are . It 's best to let me ... Just give me control ! Stark . You and D 'Argo get Zhaan , Chiana and Rygel out and we 'll act as a diversion . That is suicide , Aeryn . Almost as suicidal as strolling in and walking through a security door . Camera function restored . A portal 's been breached , level nineteen . Is it Crichton ? We can 't be sure until we ... - Make sure . Stop running . You cannot resist . What is the matter with you ? What is wrong ? Aeryn , Scorpy . When he put me in his chair , he did something and it 's getting worse . Guards . Oh , hell . Got an idea . Take your first on the right . Ten percent of this plan is lunacy . Fifty percent of these riches is not enough ! One hundred percent of dead is dead ! Stark , which way now ? Stark ! D 'Argo , are you there ? Stark , they need you . If you fail them , I 'll kill you . Yeah , yeah , yeah , this will work . Trust me . We just have to find a place to ... - This will never work . get our clothes off . - You two . Hold it . They went that way . Level twenty two , corridor riga , segment trada five . They must be overriding portal controls . - Not possible . Notify me constantly of their progress . This is my facility , Scorpius . You go nowhere without me . Nat ... Natira . How much do you owe me ? In every way ? Too much , that I cannot repay . If I leave with this man in custody , then all is forgiven . Blue , how you doing ? We 're almost to the central processing area , John . Stark , open the last door . Not the plan , not the plan , not the plan . My fault , my fault , my fault . They 're almost out of there . Come on , you can do it . Stark . Stark , open the door . I can hear them coming . Stark ! John , I need you . Aeryn . - What ? If Scorpius gets me ... I know , shoot you . No . No , no , no . Shoot him . Look , we have to talk . Not here . You 'll get us both killed . Aeryn , I have to tell you how I feel . I have to tell you . No , you don 't . - Yes , I do . I do . No , you don 't . Natira , report . Crichton 's heading towards the main chamber . Your current vector will intercept him . The Delvian still has the special reserve you intended for Scorpius . Good luck to her . The least of our worries . They 're coming , D 'Argo . Hurry ! I am working on it . Just frelling hurry . Chiana , have you got your pill for the melar gas ? Take it now . Where 's my pill ? This time I get a pill . We have to reach them quickly . I 'm following the frelling sequence ! That 's it , D 'Argo . You 're back in their system . A pill for Rygel ? Of course not . When did anyone think of me ? Stand your ground ! Don 't move ! We 'll shoot if you resist . Don 't think about it . Oh , frell ! Much better . I knew I had to adjust the mix . Crichton 's out racing you to the main chamber . Move it , Scorpius . Capture them . Take Crichton , alive . We must change your cooling rods . You 're burning through them too fast . Oh , thank the goddess you made it . Is Rygel dead ? Unconscious . Aeryn , you help them load . I 'm gonna go seal all the doors . No , reverse that , John . You do this , I 'll do that . - There 's no escape . - This is mine . Load . John ... Come on . Hold it ! - Come on , Braca . Hold it ! Help me ! Thank you . Hey , Braca . Tell me , is the rematch ever better than the original fight ? Hmm ? Hmm ? Hmm ? You have no idea how patient I have been for this moment . Well , since I got you here , tell me . What the frell did you put in my head ? ! Some awareness . A neuro-biotracer . Call it what you like . A tiny chip , a tiny seed that 's been growing in your brain . Touching every aspect of your personality ... your memory . Didn 't happen to see LuAnne Johnson , did ya ? And whispering advice . I trust it 's helped save you once or twice since escaping my Gammak Base . Oh , what 's the matter Scorpy ? You don 't look too good . Neither do you , Crichton . I got a piece of you in me . Now you got a piece of me in you . Change it . Change it now ! Scorpius . You could not let me die any more than I can sacrifice you . That 's what you 're telling me in my head , but I think I 'll give it a shot . No , you will save me . No . Now , take one . Take it . No ! Take it . Take it ! Take it ! Now insert the rod in the gannet . - No . Insert the rod ! Insert the rod ! Insert it ! Insert it ! Insert it ! Insert it ! Insert the rod , John ! You 're really not my type . Die , you grotesque bastard ! Even if it means I die , too . Neither one of us can die . Oh , say can you see ... I command you to help me . - By the dawn 's early light ... John Crichton , I command you to help me ! - What so proudly we hail ... At the twilight 's last gleaming ... Whose broad stripes and bright stars ... We 've done it ! We are rich ! As soon as we establish an exchange rate for these ingots , we 'll know exactly how rich we really are . We agreed , Rygel , nothing gets touched until after D 'Argo 's son and the others get freed from the slave auction , right ? Yes , yes , let 's all pretend we 're not thinking how ill-advised that covenant was . He provides a perspective otherwise lacking . I must apologize for my panic . My shame is great . You did brilliantly . We wouldn 't have had a chance without you . For which I am eternally grateful . Ka D 'Argo . You 've proven yourself to be a worthy friend . And one not to be distrusted again . Nice sentiment . After all these desolate cycles , I 'm about to see my son . And that tortured being there is the one who 's made it possible . What about your other tortured friend ? Friends support one another unconditionally . They also forgive one another . It was real . I didn 't imagine it . What was real , John ? I had Scorpius in my head . And it was hard letting him die . There 's still a part of me that wishes I 'd saved him . Well , you mustn 't forget what he wanted from you . He wanted to dissect your brain . Hmm . Aeryn , I , um ... I meant what I said ... didn 't say . I know .

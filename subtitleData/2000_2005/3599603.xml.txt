 - MAN : Doctor ! - Please . We 've got to get away from all these people . - They 're with somebody . - With somebody ? Another man . According to these gentlemen , a man stepped forward . A guy in his 30s . His eyes turned black , and they shot him . They were waiting for her to demonstrate . They see she 's got the power , and bam ! They 're here . You 're saying the one who did all this was an alien ? You are paying attention . She didn 't leave in a spaceship . She left in a Dodge Durango . Still doesn 't make you look very good , does it ? You take a nine-year-old girl and a special ops unit into the American heartland , you lose the girl , you come up with nothing . - You 're in the deep end . - You 're right in there with me . I have to go back to Washington and explain what happened here . Find me the girl and whoever she 's with . - How 'd you like us to do that ? - The little girl 's weak . This being who came to help her has been shot . You 'll have a definite advantage . - Smooth sailing , I 'd say . - Just do it . And when we find her ? Then find me . I 'll take it from there . WAKEMAN : That 's worked so well up till now . I 'm not goin ' down alone on this one . Try not to screw things up . They 're about ten hours ahead of us in Montana . I had our guy switch the monitoring to my laptop in case the general got it into his head to check . Good . Mary , you 've been through a lot with your father and everything with Allie . I just wanted you to know I 'm here for you . I know that . You said you thought they were waiting for her to demonstrate . Yeah . What happens now that she has ? Pie . - What ? - Pie . My rule of any car trip . Let 's find a place to get some . I 'll tell you my theory of everything . JOHN : She 's exhausted from all that she 's been doing . - She 'll be all right . - Will she ? And then what ? They come for her again or she does something again . You 've gotta do something to change all this . I just want my little girl back . You started all this , and you don 't have any more of an idea where it 's gonna end than any of us do . Charlie ? What 's going on ? Get out . Get out ! LISA : What are you doing ? Just give me a minute . I want to talk to you . LISA : We need his help . Allie does . His help ? He 's the one responsible ! I want to know what the hell this is all about . Charlie , you 're hurting him . Stop it . He 's already weak . Sweetheart , it 's gonna be all right . Give me a minute . Why are you here ? Why have you been doing this ? What the hell do you want ? - We 're just trying to understand . - Understand what ? Everything . JOHN : I 'll try to put this in terms that you commonly use . I 'm ... a scientist . We were all scientists . We came here to learn about your world . Our idea was to find out everything- - your history , your biology ... everything . We came here to learn . We 're not that different from you genetically , biologically , but what you call evolution has changed us . We see things in you that ... we no longer recognize in ourselves . WAKEMAN : What do we know ? They 're this energy that can manifest itself in different ways- - as the beings we 've seen , as their crafts , as our thoughts . There 's no right or wrong about them . JOHN : The whole concept of right and wrong was ... alien to us . The idea that the things we were doing were cruel ... WAKEMAN : They have no concept of kindness or cruelty , no way of seeing beyond the oneness of all that energy ... JOHN : ... to the separateness , the uniqueness , your ability to hate , to love , to feel . You have compassion as well as cruelty . We lack both . Or that is , the traits lie dormant ... WAKEMAN : ... in their brains , like the animal that lives far back inside all of us . But an experience of something basic can awaken that primitive thing . JOHN : And that 's what happened . Your grandmother Sally , she took me in and showed me a great kindness . MARY : Something could have touched one of them , something simple , awakened the sense of what was missing , something gone and half-remembered . And so our greatest experiment began . Could they put it back , this thing that had been bred out of them for eons and eons ? JOHN : Your emotional core- - your strength , your feeling- - and our more-evolved consciousness ... could we bring these two together ? If we could do this , we would have the next ... MARY : ... step in the evolution of life . The experiment was an unqualified success . What do you think is gonna happen next ? Allie goes with us . We work with her . We help her to understand our part of the equation . That 's never gonna happen . You still don 't get it . This ... thing you saw in my grandmother , this compassion , our humanity- - you still don 't have a clue what that means . Allie is my daughter . She is nine years old . I love her with all my heart and soul . You will never take her away from me . She can 't stay here , Lisa . She did too much . If she uses her power again , that part of her that 's us , it will kill her . You were right . Those people will keep coming after her , and she will do something to keep you or Charlie safe . It 's the only place for her . That is what 's next . No , it isn 't . You 've inflicted enough pain on this planet . It 's over . Let it go . Go away . Montana . Looks like they 've stopped . We should be able to catch up with them tonight . Tomorrow morning at the latest . We 've taken it all the way together , haven 't we ? I don 't know what you mean . We 're gonna be there when it comes together . We 're gonna know we did our part . Our part ? Keep Allie safe , so they can finish their work . You 're fine with that , aren 't you ? Them finishing their work . I can 't wait . That 's all you want , right ? Front seat at the show ? They 're more highly evolved than we are . She 's more highly evolved than they are . It 's the way of the Tao . Nature takes its course . What if it 's our nature to fight back ? Then we lose . Evolution 101 . Pretty weird couple of days . Yeah , pretty weird . You all right ? I just want to be home listening to my CDs playing soccer with my friends . I know . I 'm just a little kid . I didn 't ask anyone to make me special . WOMAN ON RADIO : My friend Dale . his son was killed in the Gulf War . Allie showed him his boy . We all saw him clear as day ... Your uncle should have seen the ad we put in the paper by now . He will . He 'll call . RADIO HOST : What else happened . Cynthia ? CYNTHIA : People were there from the government . people who 'd come to take her . HOST : I want to hear the rest of this . but right now we 've got a call I 've been hoping for . I 'm gonna ask you to please stay on hold a few minutes . As he does from time to time . noted UFO-logiest Tom Clarke is checking in . - Talk to me . Tom . - TOM : Hi . Bill . HOST : Tom Clarke . What news from the front. my friend ? TOM : I 've got nothing tonight but a false alarm . I 'm calling from Gray 's Lake in Idaho . HOST : Gray 's Lake . Promising name . Uncle Tom ! Uncle Tom ! Hey , there , sweetie . Hey . - It 's good to see you . - Good to see you , too . Is this him ? - He 's my dad . - I know . - Tom . - Charlie . Thanks for taking such good care of our family . What kind of adventures you been on lately ? - A lot 's been goin ' on . - Oh , yeah ? Tom ? It 's good to see you . I thought we 'd go into Mexico through Texas . I got a guy down in El Paso . He 's working on the documents . He 's gonna meet us at my mum 's old place in Lubbock . I was thinking that you guys should go down to South America . I 've got a family there who can put you up indefinitely in Buenos Aires . It 's a big change , but I just think it 's something you have to do . What ? You 've got a feeling ? This is all supposed to be going somewhere , that 's all . Mexico sounds like a good idea . What do we do about him ? He doesn 't look too good . I don 't think we 'll have to worry about him much longer . ALLIE : People talk a lot as if the most important thing in life is to always see things for what they really are . But everything we do . every plan we make is kind of a lie . We 're closing our eyes and pretending the day won ' t ever come when we won ' t need to make any more plans . Hope is the biggest lie there is . and it is the best . You have to keep going as if it all mattered . or else we wouldn 't keep going at all . ( country western music on radio ) Want a granola bar ? Are they good ? They 're not as healthy as they say on the wrapper . They 've got a lot of sugar in them . You eat food , don 't you ? - We eat . - Try it . That 's good . I don 't want to do this . I know . At the gas station , I was gonna make those men hurt each other . I could have done that . - But you didn 't . - I almost did . I don 't want to hurt people . How do I make this stop ? I mean , if I couldn 't do any of those things , then people would leave me alone , wouldn 't they ? I don 't know that much about people . - Is there anything I can do ? - Nothing . Will the others come for you ? I 'm not important . Allie , things are gonna get hard for you for a while . You 'll be afraid , and you 'll be alone . You 're becoming more than you already are . I 'm not going to go with you . I belong here with my family . I brought this for you . What is it ? It was your great-grandmother 's . She gave it to me before I left . I can 't do this much longer . I know . - How you feelin ' ? - Okay . You always wanted to go on a long car trip , didn 't you ? ( laughs ) Allie ... John ... he 's helped us out , and he 's hurt , but that doesn 't mean you have to do anything he asks . I already told him I wasn 't going to go with him . What did he say ? He gave me this . Let me have that . My dad , he used to say that kids shouldn 't ever have to think about anything more complicated than baseball . You 're gonna be a little girl again ... I promise . Hey , back together again . See how this looks , gorgeous . I 'm never gonna let you go , honey . Never . MARY : Oh , that 's lovely . I 've got a gun to your mother 's back . I 'm betting I can get a shot into her before you turn the gas station into a flying saucer or a house of pies . Allie , don 't try to do anything . Do you understand ? Be a good girl . Listen to your mum . Allie , when we were in that farmhouse , you saw something that scared you . I think you know what they want you to do , and I don 't think you want to do it . I can take care of you . I can keep you safe from your ... friends . We can work together on this . I don 't want to hurt anybody . I really don 't . You 're out of options . You must have realized that by now . I have the resources and technology to help you . It 's me or them . I just want to help . You 're lying . You can 't help anyone . Let 's go . Get in the car ... now ! Get in ! Move ! Move ! CHARLIE : Lisa ! Allie ! Hey ! Hey ! ( horn honks ) WAKEMAN : Hold on ! - Allie , don 't do anything . It 's not safe ! - I didn 't do anything ! ( whimpering ) Come on ! ( gunshot ) - Stop it ! - You were gonna shoot her ! You 're damn right . She 's staying here with us ! That was too close . How did they find us ? CHARLIE : Sweetheart , I want to ask you something . Those people from the government- - when you went with them , you said they put something over your head . Right . I heard them say it was to block a signal . If those people know enough to block that signal , then they know how to read it , to track it . You have one , too , Lisa . That 's how they found you in Seattle . There 's not much point in going to Buenos Aires , is there ? No matter where we go , they 'd find us . TOM : There 's gotta be something we can do . You can shut her off , can 't you ? You can do something so they won 't be able to track her signal or mine . If you can do it , then do it . You owe us that much . I can 't do it . I don 't have the strength . But Allie can . Find it inside you , Allie . Can you ? LISA : Allie , don 't do anything . You 're weak . ALLIE : I have to . Allie , please , no . ( big band music playing ) ( turns music off ) What are you doing ? The music helps me concentrate . We 're not picking up their signals . I know . You know ? Shut off . Gone . No more signals . - You didn 't bother to tell me ? - I was gettin ' to it . - Do you think Allie did it ? - Probably . - You seem pleased about it . - Check this out . The sightings are starting again . Lights in the sky . Idaho and Nebraska . We better be ready . You can 't do anything , Mary . Don 't you get it ? You want to talk about what happened at the parking lot ? - You were gonna shoot her . - I was going to stop her . That 's not up to you . You 're not gonna let it go , are you ? I can 't . Do you know the story of the Medusa ? You look at her and you turn to stone . Unless you know the secret which you have to be an enlightened warrior to learn . This is going somewhere , right ? If you know the secret ... you can kill her . And then the winged horse , Pegasus , flies from her head and the world becomes a very ... very beautiful place . I used to think we could get something out of this . A new science ... something . I even thought we could get the better of them somehow . But we 're not ready to be anything but spectators in this . Anything more stone . I 'm not giving up , Chet . I 'm gonna find her , and I 'm gonna be more than just a witness to this . MAN ON RADIO : If it 's really all about the little girl Allie like all your callers are saying . then maybe this isn 't some evil conspiracy after all . Mr Jeffries . Maybe this is all about coming together and moving on . JEFFRIES : Thank you . Bruce from Nebraska . End on a good note . I always say . Are these the last days ? Is it all coming to a head ? The lights are in the sky. and a little girl is out there somewhere on the road . She 's in our thoughts . and she has our prayers . This is William Jeffries saying . " Keep watching the skies and hope for an answer that doesn 't hurt . " LISA : I should 've stopped her . I never should 've let her shut us off . All right , all right . Take a breath . Take a breath . Let her come out of it a little before she travels again . Nobody 's gonna find you here . - What about John ? - Let him rest . Give Allie a couple of days until she 's stronger . My friend will be here by then with the papers , and we can move on . What are you doing ? I can 't stay with you anymore . If I 'm here , sooner or later you 'll be found . Now that you 've turned your signals off once I 'm gone ... none of us will know where you are . You mean no one will be able to find me ? I can 't promise you that . Then at least you 'll get the chance to be the little girl you said you wanted to be . But if things get too difficult if you feel that you can 't stay here any longer , you can find us again . You 'll know . Find the part of you that is us . We 'll hear you , and we 'll come for you . But unless you call us ... we won 't be able to find you . I 'm the one that 's gonna know ? When the time comes ... it 'll be your choice . What I 've learned from doing this what 's changed in me I would never , never do any of this again . This is all my fault . It wasn 't mine to meddle . You wouldn 't have been able to do it if you weren 't supposed to . I 'm very glad I got to see you . Good-bye , Allie . Can I walk with you a minute ? Just to the edge of the woods . This is as far as you should go . Good-bye , Allie . ALLIE : How do you let someone go ? How do you understand that that 's all right . that everything changes ? How do you find a way for that to make you feel good about life instead of breaking your heart ? The hardest thing you 'll ever learn is how to say good-bye . LISA : Allie ? Allie ? Allie ... Allie . Charlie ? Charlie ! What did he do to her ? He did something and just left ! No , I don 't think so . I think she was about to give out anyway . I think he left to protect her ! I had this feeling about John , something he was feeling . When John showed Allie how to block our signals , I think he made it so the aliens couldn 't find us , either . But as long as he stayed with us , sooner or later they were gonna find us . He was part of them ... I don 't know . But I think when he went back , he was giving Allie , giving us all a chance . So we should take it . Maybe they don 't know where she is , either . - That 's a thought , isn 't it ? - You can 't be serious . What if they 're lookin ' for her , too ? Her signal disappeared and then her mother 's . And then the lights appeared . How 's that possible ? She 's with one of them . Good question . So what do you think ? The man driving the camper was Tom Clarke , Lisa 's uncle . Yeah , I thought I recognized him . He 's gettin ' a little long in the tooth . I had the office upload my grandfather 's files , everything we have on Tom Clarke . My--my grandfather went to Texas once . Yeah , and got the be Jesus scared out of him by Jacob Clarke , right ? Tom still owns his mother 's farmhouse , the one my grandfather went to get Jacob . - You think that 's where they 've gone ? - I 'm all for takin ' a look . What if they 're there , Mary ? Then what ? ( big band music playing ) ( turns up volume ) Austin , Texas . Tom Clarke . This is Tom Clarke . I 'm not home right now . but if you 'd like to leave a message . just leave it at the tone . Tom Clarke , this is Chet Wakeman . I 'm calling you with a warning . I want to help you . ( gunshot ) ( whimpering ) You know , I never would have thought , 50-odd years ago , when we found him in the shed it was all leading towards something like this . They took you , right ? They did . And you stood up to them , didn 't you ? I tried . You stood by Allie and Lisa . This goes way back for you . Grandpa ? My dad , too . They didn 't do us any favours . - Well ... - Sorry . Nothing 's ever simple , is it ? I 'm gonna go inside and see how Allie 's doin ' . ( camera shutter clicks ) ( siren wailing ) What happened ? I called you as soon as I heard . I 've explained a bit of the situation to the local authorities . They 've agreed to yield jurisdiction . How 'd it go in Washington ? In my years as a commanding officer , I find I get the best results from my people when I don 't refer to them as incompetent idiots . People perform best when they 're not riddled with self-doubt . The joint chiefs seem to favour a more direct approach . We got 48 hours to find the girl . I want to thank you for steppin ' up , Captain . Colonel Breck wasn 't up to the challenge , something this--this unusual . Thank you , sir . With all due respect to the colonel , sir , what did he expect ? It 's one thing to expect something , Captain , quite another to have it bite you in the ass . That is one cold and nasty bitch . Clearly , she knows where the little girl is . I imagine she and the doctor both knew , but there was a difference of opinion on what to do about it . That is one cold and nasty bitch . MARY : That 's exactly right , General . I made a call to my guy . He 'll be here as soon as the papers are ready . Probably be tomorrow . Then we 'll get you out of here , get you out of the country clean . What is it ? There was this ... there was this message on my machine at home ... from Chet Wakeman , one of the hotshots on the project , the guy who came after you in Seattle . Right . Right . He said he wanted to help us . Then he got cut off . Probably just some sort of bluff , get us to move too quickly . Yeah , probably . Can you get your guy to hurry with the papers ? I already made that call . - This way , Miss Crawford . - Are these really necessary ? For the authorities to feel comfortable handing you over , yeah , they are . Sit down . It disgusts me to have to deal with you . I want that on the table . I understand that . When we 're through all this , I 'm gonna see to it that you 're held accountable for what you 've done . So let 's get to it , then . You knew where the little girl was , and you chose not to tell me . You wanted to keep her for yourself . I thought I 'd use her to re-establish my power base . What changed your mind ? Dr Wakeman . You 've been monitoring the reports from the Northwest , the lights ? Yeah . So far , that 's all they 've been , just some sightings of lights . He thought that this was it , they 're coming for Allie . Why don 't they just take her , then ? Because , at the moment , they don 't know where she is . She 's with one of them , the one from the gas station . Maybe he 's the one who turned her signal off . Maybe he 's protecting her . Why would he be doin ' that ? Remorse ? I came after Allie in a gas station . She escaped with the help of that alien . Allie didn 't do a thing . It sounds like she didn 't have to . No . No . She 's down , General . She 's spent . Suppose I 'm right . Suppose they don 't know where she is . Then , for the moment , they can 't protect her . For the moment . So you want to get to her before they do . I want to finish what we started . After everything you 've done . You know what the stakes are , General . He was going to warn her . Warn her ? You 're gonna have to work with me . You want to take these off ? MARY : Tom Clarke 's mother 's house , Lubbock , Texas . This is what we didn 't want you to know . You 've taken this away from me before , and it blew up in your face . When this is over , you can have me arrested , do whatever you think you need to do , but for the moment , you need someone who understands what it is you might be up against . You need me . GENERAL : I want this quick and quiet . Get our people out of Fort Ash and down to Texas . ALLIE : They will be coming soon . coming to try to stop what was going to happen next . But maybe they could be stopped . Maybe something could happen that would make it hard for them to do what they wanted to do . - How is she ? - The same . - You think they 're coming ? - It 's just a matter of time . Well , there 's no point in running unless we have a place to run to . Something like this , the government can only do because nobody 's watching . - That 's what you always said . - Yeah . I have an idea . How far do you have to go to make a phone call ? Who are you going to call , Charlie ? I 'm not going to call anybody . You are . JEFFRIES : I 've never been inside a UFO , never met one of these creatures , and yet I believe with all my heart that this is real . Why ? Because I do not believe that hundreds of thousands of people could tell the same lie . If this next caller 's who I think it is , folks , we 're in for a real treat . " Tom Clarke back again , " it says here on my screen . To what do we owe the pleasure ? Did you find something in Idaho ? Talk to me , and I 'll talk to you . It 's about that little girl the army 's been looking for . We been gettin lots of calls about her . The people who have been calling are telling the truth . I know this little girl . I was hoping your listeners could help us out . I believe we have a lot to talk about , Tom , but I have to pay my bills first , so if you 'd just hang on ... you still there , Tom ? I 'm here . Listen , Tom , we 're off the air now . This little girl ... I 've been getting these really extreme calls out of Seattle . What can you tell me about her ? For starters ... she 's my niece . It 's done . JEFFRIES : I 've got information about this girl you 've heard about on the news , on this program , and , as usual , you 're not gettin ' the whole story . This little girl , she 's a piece of the sky , my friends . Have you been taken ? Well , so has she . Have you had experiences beyond human comprehension ? Same 's true of Allie . This little girl. my friends. she may hold the key to an understanding of all that you 've gone through . The government believes it . That 's why Allie 's not safe because they 're not going to rest till they have her in their hands where they can look at her . try to figure out what this is all about . That 's why she needs your help . They can do what they do because they can do it in secret . They don 't have to stand in the light of day . If you 're on the road tonight , turn your car toward the state of Texas . If you 're in bed , get up and get dressed because they 're not gonna be able to touch her if there are witnesses . The government must be on the road already . but we have to get out there first to save this little girl . So many of you call me , e-mail me , write to me , and you 're starving for an answer . You want to know why you were taken , what this has all been about . We 're gonna save one child. my friends . and. in doing so . we may just learn that answer . Tom , Lisa , you should come see this . Their target is a little girl . Her name is Allie . She 's the focus of our government and of a race of aliens that have been visiting this planet since the late 1 940s . FEMALE REPORTER : This is the girl in question . While the government has offered a reward for information that may help them to find her . army officials deny any connection between their search for the girl and reports of troop movements from Fort Ash . Mr Jeffries. do you believe that this troop movement is related to the government search for the girl ? We have come here to Texas to see this little girl and to understand what 's been going on for all these years . Super-secret missions , government conspiracies involving UFOs and aliens ? It may all be a bit hard to swallow , but Jeffries is not alone in his belief . Tom ? Tom Clarke ? Thanks for comin ' , Bill . This is really something . I guess people really do listen to the radio at 4.00 in the morning . How 's your niece ? One of these people happened to be a doctor . She 's in there with her right now . Good . This might be a little beyond my medical capabilities . Can she travel ? Look , I 'm a multiple abductees myself . I 've been taken repeatedly since I was seven , but I ... I still don 't even really know what we 're dealing with here . This might be something better suited to their medicine than to ours . No ! No way in hell is she going anywhere near them . We 'll--we 'll find a way to help her here . Okay ... okay . I 'll leave you folks alone with your little girl . You try to be strong for your kid , you know ? " I 'm your mum . I can take care of everything . I can keep you safe . " But really , you know , there 's nothing you can do . You can 't keep them safe from anything at all . Hey ... you 've done a lot . We 're gonna be all right . Tom 's got it all set up for us . His friend brings out the papers , and we disappear into the sunset . I spent my childhood disappearing . I 'm pretty good at it . ( knocking ) - Nina . - Hi . Oh , my God ! I can 't believe you 're really here . Denny heard about it on the radio . God , is she all right ? No , she 's not all right at all , Nina . It was a series of miracles , that 's what it was . The things that happened , what they did to us , it was just a series of miracles , and the things that she can do- - there 's a kindness to her power , an intention to do good . I was really angry . I still am , I guess . But what we saw , and what she did- - I 'm with these people . After what I did to them , I 'm here with them . They were able to forgive me . That 's because of her . This is as close as we can get without getting the attention of the crowd . We 'll treat this like a riot situation , have the guards go in first , get the crowd out of there . Still , you gotta admire the move . We 're tryin ' to fly under the radar , and they put up a wall of people between us and the little girl . She must really mean a lot to those folks . Goin ' through these lengths . We 'll move in tonight . COMPUTER : Video message waiting ... Hey. there. toots . I programmed this file to send if I didn 't delete it in 24 hours . I guess I didn 't delete it . which I guess means ... you deleted me . I kinda saw that one comin ' . You must be headed in for the final wing ding about now . God . I wish I could be there . There 's something I wanted to share with you . We 're all so desperate for meaning. aren 't we ? All of us . You. too . Mary ... even if you think you 're not . You want answers . and in that way . I think the aliens are gonna disappoint you . Here 's the stone truth of it . They 're still asking the same questions we are . No one is God here . We 're all in the same boat . That was our life together . wasn 't it ? We asked questions . I used to love the way you ... I used to love the way you 'd get that faraway look in your eye whenever you were working ' something out . We could have been happy . Mary . I really believe that ... If only you 'd just let it go . That 's another question for them. isn 't it ? What is it that makes us so screwed up ? Why do we do the things we do ? Well. maybe ... they can create something better than the sum of its parts . Allie belongs with them . We 're not ready for the knowledge they have . It would destroy us . Look at me . Guess in the end . I turned out to be something of a humanist . You 're shakin ' your head. right ? See ? You do love me . What brought you here ? As soon as I heard what was happening with the little girl , I--I knew I had to be here . - How long do you think you 'll stay ? - As long as it takes . - And you ? - We all feel it . I don 't know if any of us could tell you exactly why , but we all knew we had to be here . It 's kind of hard to explain if you haven 't been taken , but ... we all knew we had to be here . The girl , Allie , is inside this house . Some say she 's resting , others say she 's dying . The question we haven 't been able to answer yet is what does she mean to this group of abductees , people who believe they 've been taken ? TOM : I really appreciate you doing this for me . No problem . Good luck , Tom . This is all of it- - passports , visas . We have a car waiting for you in the woods . An old back road leads all the way to Highway 1 77 . Dale and I took it this morning . It leads all the way past the army . We came out on the other side . They weren 't any the wiser . You ready ? ( horn honking ) We went to the sporting goods store and cleared out the hunting section . If anyone tries to hurt our little girl , they 're gonna have to come through us first . I don 't want you to do that . Allie ? MAN : Tom , could I talk to her ? Just for a moment . No . Please go back to your cars ! Bill , please help me get these people ... Folks , please ... Uh ... uh ... she 's not ready to talk to us yet . She 's just not ready . - You all right ? - I 'm fine . Listen , we 're gonna get out of here . We 're going someplace where none of this matters , okay ? Everything 's ready . We gotta go . No , not now . I want to talk to them . Hi . I know you 're all scared , and you don 't have to be scared anymore . Honey ... honey ... you don 't have to do this . All you have to be is my little girl . The rest of it , it doesn 't have to happen . You don 't have to do anything . They 're scared . They need something . You don 't have to be the one to give it to them . I think maybe I do . You have something in your heads . It lets them know where you are . I can shut them off . When they shut off , they 'll fall out . Don 't be scared . ALLIE : They won 't come for you anymore . They won 't be able to find you . No one 's going to take you . It doesn 't seem right to , uh , interfere with us the way they did . Maybe not to us , but if we saw this from someplace else , it was just time for this to happen . WOMAN : For what to happen ? Me . Listen to me ! All of you ! All of you , listen to me ! They 're not gonna do anything ! There 's too many of us here ! Do you want to help ? Stay in front of the porch ! Go to the mayor now . Get me the wireless unit . MAN : Attention ! This area is under federal control ! Please make yourselves available for immediate relocation to a debriefing area . Your vehicles and personal belongings ... You don 't listen to that ! It 's a lie ! You stay right here ! Stay right in front of the porch ! Right here ! Stay in front of Allie . Stay right here . Stay in front of Allie . We 're stronger together ! Stay in front of the porch . Just so you know , a lot of us are armed and willing to give our lives to protect Allie or take some if we have to . Get out of here now . Put your plan into action . We 'll do what has to be done . CHARLIE : Thanks . They 're here in force , come out of the night to put the monster back in the box . We better get back inside . No ... Allie ... Are they gonna come for you now ? John left that up to me . Do you think if we 'd been regular people , Charlie would have lived with us , and we could have been a family ? I know that would have happened . I don 't want to go . I want to stay here with you . Then stay ! We 've got a plan . We can get out of here right now ! It 'll be okay . Give the command . Troops ... advance ! WOMAN : Here they come . After a little girl , ladies and gentlemen ! MAN : Please disperse immediately ! If you do not disperse . you will be in violation of Federal Ordinance 860 ... endangering of public welfare ... ( gasps ) Oh , Allie . Allie , please , please don 't . Please . You heard Dale . If I stay here , people will kill each other . I don 't want that to happen because of me . Then we 'll go away . We have a plan . Where could we go ? This would all just happen again . Allie , Allie , listen to me . I am not gonna let that happen . We 're gonna get Charlie , and we 're gonna get out of here . We 'll figure out a way . There 's nothing we can do . We 're a family now . We can try . We were always a family . ( yelling and screaming ) General . I didn 't ask for this ! I want to be a little girl ! I just want to be a little girl ! ( gasps ) They 're really coming this time aren 't they ? Charlie ... I 'm glad you turned out to be my dad . I love you . I love you , too , Daddy . I have to go . No . No , I can 't . I can 't , I can 't . I won 't let you . I won 't let you go . You ... you said this was all meant to be . And I meant all of it . - This part , too . - I can 't stand this . I have to go . And I said I wouldn 't ever let you go . I love you , honey every day and twice on Sundays . I love you , too , Mama . Is she makin ' this all up ? Is this just another screen ? This is no screen , General . This is real . Can you stop them ? Can you stop them ? ! Please ! You gotta do something . This is my family . That 's my daughter ! We can 't . Allie belongs with them ... her and the knowledge of how they did all this . I 'm sorry . - That , too . - No . This is a record of everything . Even if we lose the little girl , at least we 'll still have this . Sooner or later , we 'll know what they know . Exactly . You 're the one who was gonna see this through to the end . I did . Sir ! Let her see the rest of this . She deserves that much . ALLIE : I don 't know what will happen next . I don 't know what I 'm going to be . what I 'm going to learn . but what I do know is this- - life. all life . is about asking questions . not about knowing answers . It is wanting to see what 's over the next hill that keeps us all going . We have to keep asking questions . wanting to understand . Even when we know we 'll never find the answers . we have to keep on asking the questions . Excuse me . Did you know the little girl or her family personally ? No , I didn 't . I just came to see what the deal was . Sir , shall we pick up the mother and father ? The mother and father ? You 're talkin ' about the little girl 's parents ? Yes , sir , her parents . They must have slipped away in all the excitement . I don 't see them anywhere . Neither do I , sir . Shall I tell the JTF guys to head back to Fort Bliss ? I don 't see why not , Captain . There 's nothin ' for us here . Thought you might want this . She did all right , Lis . She took the other one with her . She took the other star . She 's gonna be back , Charlie . She really is . She 's gonna be back . ALLIE : My mother always talked to me a lot about the sky . She liked to watch the clouds in the day and the stars at night . Especially the stars . We would play a game sometimes . a game called " What 's beyond the sky ? " We would imagine darkness or a blinding light or something else that we didn 't know how to name . But. of course . that was just a game . There 's nothing beyond the sky . The sky just is . and it goes on and on . and we play all of our games beneath it . # . Just before it gets dark # . # . When the light still hangs in the sky # . # . The day 's not quite come # . # . All its promises still in your own eyes # . # . Between the time your mother calls # . # . And the time you put the ball away # . # . There 's a lifetime to be lived # . # . And a world where every dream is here to stay # . # . Just before the night comes # . # . And you run back to the safety of your world # . # . Just before it gets dark # . # . You can believe in every story ever told # . # . In those last precious moments # . # . There 's a beauty no one wants to give away # . # . Well , nothin ' lasts forever # . # . But those moments keep forever far away # . # . Just before it gets dark # . # . Before you grow old # . # . Before you 're too old to pretend # . # . Just before it gets dark # . # . And you know your dreams will not come back again # . # . Hold on # . # . Hold on tight # . # . And I promise you , baby # . # . It 'll all be all right # . # . I promise you , baby # . # . It 'll all be all right # . ( Subtitle Revised by HchC )

 This is a story from a long , long time ago . To the people of the Galactic Federation , this solar system was a realm of mysteries . Every planet sent their ships to discover a new ship route among the stars , the Star Road . And then , they discovered the Earth . Discovered ? It sounds like Columbus discovering America . The Galactic Federation has an agreement . If a life form is identified on an unexplored planet , they must observe and judge . Judge ? Ajudgement of intelligence and maturity of the mind , to see whether or not they would be able to have equal diplomatic relations with the Federation . Unfortunately , Earth was judged to be undeveloped during its first review . But ... But ? So , what happened ? Mom ! Food ! Huh ? Wha ? Why am I saying something like that at a time like this ? Seconds please ! Huh ? Huh ? Seconds please ! Seconds please ! Seconds please ! Seconds please . Huh ? When I left space there were sunny-side-ups . Record of the School Wars : MURYOU Record of the School Wars : MURYOU I looked up at the sky ...

I can 't believe you fell asleep eating breakfast . Yeah , you 're right ... Hajime ! Hajime , you 've been acting strange lately . You 're hiding something ! I might be . But , don 't worry about it . I think it 'd be weird if a brother told his sister everything . Don 't worry about it . It 's okay . But ... Class Rep ! Morning , Class Rep. Hey , good morning Muryou . Morning . Who is he ? Oh , he 's Muryou Subaru . He 's the transfer kid in my class . Huh ? Is he the guy who came back after a divorce due to family reasons ? Came back after ... ? That 's all been straightened out now . Well , it 's your fault for not explaining it . Anyway , so what 's up ? You usually don 't come this way . After what happened yesterday , I was worried about how you 'd be doing today . Thanks for being ... Where 's Setsuna , by the way ? She took the last train home yesterday . She said she has a lecture today at noon . Ah , college students are so lucky . Subaru ! Yes ? It seems my brother went to your house yesterday and inconvenienced you . I 'm very sorry about that . No , it 's ... So how would you feel about this ? As a return gesture , o ... our house ... What about our house ? Please come over to our house ! Please ! No , I mean definitely ! So it 's settled ! She 's in love . Huh ? Futaba 's in love with Muryou this time ? What do you mean , this time ? My sister falls in love easily and goes after older , good-looking guys . Just so you know , the victim before you was ... Younger girls aren 't my type . I politely turned her down . Weren 't you the one that got dumped ? It 's called a difference of opinion . What do you want to do , Muryou ? You don 't have to force yourself . No , it sounds fun . I 'll go . It 's tough being popular ! That goes for both of us . Ready ! Hey , hey ... What 's with you , sneaking around in a place like this ? If I didn 't know better , I 'd think you were a spy . You 're always so narrow-minded . Always unsociable , too ... Well whatever , I hereby invite you to come with me . Invite ? Rock ! Paper ! Scissors ! Scissors ! Okay . Which one are you going to take ? The gymnasium . Red Team in the gym , and White Team in the auditorium , then . Yes , okay ! Don 't screw it up ! Okay ! There will be a Red and White Athletic Festival inaugural ceremony this afternoon . So are you really going to do it ? Well ? There will be a Red and White Athletic Festival inaugural ceremony this afternoon . So are you really going to do it ? Well ? The Red Team will meet in the gymnasium and the White Team will meet in the auditorium . The Red Team will meet in the gymnasium and the White Team will meet in the auditorium . Please head to your team meeting place after fifth period is over . I repeat ... It 's finally Captain Muryou 's debut ! This is going to be exciting . Yeah , and he just transferred too . It 's amazing how fast he 's adjusted himself . Sorry to keep you waiting ! I 'm back ... from the battlefront ... ! Huh ? Where 's Ha-chan ? He said he 's tired so he 's gonna go take a nap . What do you want ? I 'm sorry . Did you need something ? Are you gonna paralyze me again ? No ! I 'm here to check up on you . Check up on me ? Oh ... that 's very nice of you . Stop joking about it . So , well , you know ... I was worried , so ... I see . Thanks . Are you all right ? You looked really tired this morning . Yeah , well . It 's because your grandma showed me a lot yesterday . Last night , every time I closed my eyes and tried to go to sleep the universe kept spinning around and around , so I didn 't get much rest . That 's all ? What do you mean , " that 's all " ? Think about it . When I 'd say , " All right , let 's call it a day ! Time to go to bed ! " I 'd close my eyes , and all I 'd see would be stars going vroom , vroom ! Starships going , swoosh ! Oh right . There 's no sound in space because there 's no air . But putting that aside ... Whenever I close my eyes , all I see are stars going vroom , and starships going ... over and over ! I think I 'm finally at the point where I 'm so sleepy , the stars going vroom vroom don 't matter anymore . I 'm so sleepy . Wh ... what ? ... so that 's why . Oh ... Hey , did someone just laugh ? Can 't you tell ? No one 's laughing . You 're right . I 'm hearing things . What 's with you ? You 're so funny . I didn 't expect you to be this way . You 're really something . Huh ? We receive that incantation when we turn five , and are " chosen " ... Chosen ? Those who can use the power , and those who can 't ... Power ? Do you mean your telekinetic power ? Usually people are bedridden for three days when they receive that incantation . Why ? Images you 've never known come flooding in ! The universe , Galactic Federation , aliens ... Even a child knows these visions are something you 're not supposed to see because it 's something so completely out of the ordinary . People who believe that knowledge can be learned by studying at school who are studious and regarded as smart , those are the people who shouldn 't receive the incantation , because it can be disastrous . That 's what my father said . Well , it is very farfetched from the ordinary beliefs of society ... Some people might have a mental breakdown . Even today , when aliens are attacking , it 's still farfetched ... Why are you all right ? Let us now begin the Red Team inaugural ceremony ! Yeah ! Let 's form the White Team ! Yeah ! Cheers ! Welcome to Earth , the last paradise of the Galactic Federation . What is the meaning of this ? Can 't you tell ? It 's a welcoming party ! Don 't mock me ! Come on , stop being so cranky . I invited a bunch of people for your party . What ? Howdy . You 're late , Mr. So ! But I 'm not the only one that 's late , so cut me some slack . Hey ! Hi ! Who are they ? Same as me . They 're diplomats of the Galactic Federation . Let 's do it , Red Team ! White Team , fight ! Let 's do it , Red Team ! White Team , fight ! Let 's do it , Red Team ! White Team , fight ! Let 's do it , Red Team ! White Team , fight ! Let 's do it , Red Team ! Mmm ... fresh tea is so tasty . Let 's do it , Red Team ! Mmm ... fresh tea is so tasty . Record of the School Wars : MURYOU Hey , it 's almost time ! Is everything ready ? Futaba . You 're the one who invited a guest over , so you 'd better help me out . I will ! I was just getting my homework out of the way , 'cause it 's going to be long night . Honestly , it 's not like this is one of dad 's drinking parties ! I 'm kidding . I 'm just trying to prepare myself . Hey Futaba ! That 's bad manners ! He 's here ! Welcome home ! Welcome home ! Welcome home ! Welcome home ! Welcome home ! Hi . Hey ! So you 're really close with your grandfather ! Yup . Grandpa taught me a lot of things . He taught me academics and sports . What kind of sports do you play ? All different kinds . Oh , you 're so funny ! At some point , the sleepiness had gone away , What are your hobbies ? What are your hobbies ? and I wanted to think about the truth of the faraway universe ... and I wanted to think about the truth of the faraway universe ... Hmm ... I don 't know . and I wanted to think about the truth of the faraway universe ... Hmm ... I don 't know . Hmm ... I don 't know . ... but that 's kind of hard at the moment ... Oh , you 're so suave ! ... but that 's kind of hard at the moment ... I 've come to think that thinking logically is not my style . Hajime , what are you doing ? Oh , nothing . Come on . Let 's play a versus match ! Yeah . Yeah . Sumo Tournament I 'll announce the teams . Um ... I 'll be with ... I 'm coming ! Um ... I 'll be with ... Muryou ! Okay . Then Hajime and mom . Then Atsushi and Jirou . Hajime ! What is it ? You have visitors . I 'm Muryou 's sister , Setsuna ! I happened to be in the area and got dragged here , I 'm Shun Morihata ! Hello . Kick-off Starters These are really good sweets from Saitama . Oh , thank you . Sis , don 't you have lectures to go to ? I went to them . I came here because I 'm done . If anything , you 're fast at getting places . Now , now . Your sister came all the way because she 's worried about you . Why don 't we all have a good time ? I 'm going to announce the teams . Um ... Pub Yo-chan Cheers ! Yeah , that 's good ! But Mr. So , that 's oolong tea ! Well , it turns out that I 'm a fish who doesn 't like to drink . Isn 't this fun ? What do you think ? Isn 't this a spectacle ? The federation diplomats of various planets came a long way and gathered here to welcome you ! What are you trying to do ? Huh ? What do you mean ? Before I saw you , I contacted my planet and found out that there is no such thing as the group called the Galactic Federation , nor alien life forms called Velunnians ! Go ! Get 'em ! A little more ! Get 'em ! Go ! Get 'em ! A little more ! Get 'em ! Futaba , just a little more ! Shun , right there ! West East Futabayama Yabuhebi Hit Hit West East Futabayama Yabuhebi Hit Hit There you go ! Right there , right there , go ! West East Futabayama Yabuhebi Hit Hit Yeah ! Damn ... You almost had it ! All right ! One more time ! Hey ! I 'm next ! Okay ! Ready ... go ! Huh ? Moriyama ? Okay ! Ready ... go ! Okay ! Ready ... go ! Moriyama . Are you all right ? Yeah . Is there something wrong ? No . I 'm not good with crowds . I feel so out of the loop . I don 't know what to do with myself . Huh ? Then why 'd you come ? Right ! I don 't know why I came either ! I was walking around in the area , when Shun came up to me with a big grin and kept asking me what I was doing . He kept badgering me , and while I was thinking about how annoying he was , that woman showed up and dragged me here ! Oh . You were walking around nearby ? So you were planning to come here . What 's wrong ? I wanted to make sure ... about you ... I can 't believe you . I can 't believe that you 're laughing and smiling after you took in all those images . I 've had enough ! Who are you all ? You must be siding with those Earthlings ! Hey , I don 't want any trouble here ! Okay ! Sorry ! Come on , sit down . Sit down . You don 't get it , do you ? They 're lying to you . That 's a lie ! We really are foreign diplomats , representing planets of the Galactic Federation . That 's a lie ! Your planet ... Shortly after Planet Zaigle joined the Galactic Federation your planet split in two , waging war against itself , right ? How long have you guys been at it ? It 's been so long , your generation doesn 't even remember the Galactic Federation anymore . That 's a lie ! You ... or rather your boss , is in search of a powerful weapon , and has set his eyes on Earth . Our president is a great man ! If he 's so great , then he 'd know the legend of the solar system that has been passed down in the Galactic Federation . Fine . I 'll tell you . How the Galactic Federation came to be ... I 'll tell you the great history of the Galactic Federation that overshadows your planet 's history ... I am a solider of the great Zaigle Empire ! I will not succumb to torture ! There 's no point in turning off your translation function . My father and the others forcefully gave me the incantation . I had a bad feeling about it . Then I saw it . Shooting stars ... Spaceships going " vroom vroom " , and ... So basically ... you can 't deal with the fact that I saw it , because I have nothing to do with any of this . Then it turns out that Hajime Murata seems like a good guy , so you can 't take your anger out on him . Are you at the point where thinking about it makes you even more confused , and you don 't know what to do ? Aren 't you embarrassed ... calling yourself a good guy ? Then , why did you come here ? I don 't know . By the way , there 're other people who received that incantation , right ? How many people are like you ? Everyone native to Tenmo and you know a lot of them . There he goes . What are you going to do , Ve-yan ? I think you went a bit far by showing him all that . You 're right ... I got a little too upset with him . I 'm really sorry about this . Geez ... Just make sure this doesn 't happen again . Um , could you please send the repair bill to Planet Velunn ? Cheapskate ! ... who are you ? This language ... Your language is too cumbersome . I hope you don 't mind , but we turned your translation function on . What ? You have broken the law of this land . If you come here , you must obey the law ! What are you all ... What are you all scheming ? I know who you are ... You 're all from the Republic , aren 't you ? Damn it , their forces have even reached Earth ... The Republic ? What is that ? Wait . What were you talking aboutjust now ? We 're only following Galactic Federation procedures . We 're just going to arrest you . Don 't worry . You 're lying ! You 're lying ! This planet is dangerous ... It 's a conspiracy by the Republic ! Captain ! Please accept the data I 've collected ! That looked like an emergency communications capsule from Planet Velunn . What 's the meaning of this ? How embarrassing . Seems like my brother planets are having a feud . Do you plan to drag the Earth into it ? I won 't let anything bad happen . I swear in the name of the Galactic Federation . As always , it 's hard to breathe with this mask on . West East Masukaze Kachidoki Hit Hit Go Muryou ! Right there ! You can do it ! Something is happening , in a place that we can 't comprehend . An anxiety like this is hard to grasp , so there 's nothing we can really do . Galactic Federation . Aliens .

 PREVIOUSLY ON JEREMIAH ... IN RECENT DAYS , WE 'VE MADE CONTACT WITH AT LEAST 20 GROUPS THAT WE BELIEVE OFFER POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT ALLIANCES FOR OUR FUTURE ENDEAVORS . SOMEONE ATTHE END OF THE WORLDWANTS TO SEE ME SO WE CAN DISCUSSPUTTING THEO BACKIN HER RIGHTFUL POSITION . NOW THAT VALHALLA SECTOR 'S STARTING TO MOVE , THIS MAY BE OUR LAST CHANCETO PUT UP A UNITED FRONT BEFORE THEY COME AFTER US . YOU WERE SPYING ON US . I WAS WORKING FOR JEREMIAH 'S FATHER . I 'M TAKING THE ROVER AND GOING BACK TO THE MOUNTAIN . THIS SO-CALLED PARTNERSHIP IS OVER . ( MARKUS ) : WE GATHER HERE TODAY IN A COMMON CAUSE BECAUSE THE DESIRESTHAT UNITE US ARE GREATER THAN THE FORCES THAT DIVIDE US . IN THE COMING DAYS , WE WILL CARVE OUT A FRAMEWORK FOR A NEW COUNTRY AND A NEW FUTURE , BECAUSE IF WE FAIL TO DO SO , OTHERS WILL DO IT FOR US . WE , THE SURVIVORS OF THE BIG DEATH , HAVE GROWN TO ADULTHOOD IN THE SHADOW OF THE GREATEST DISASTER THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN . THE LAST 16 YEARS HAVE BEEN UNIMAGINABLY BRUTAL , BUT THERE COMES A TIME WHEN YOU HAVE TO STOP LOOKING BACKWARD AND START LOOKING FORWARD . STARTING TODAY , WE BEGIN PUTTING THE WORLD BACK TOGETHER AGAIN . IN THIS ROOM , WE WILL DETERMINE THE SHAPE OF THE WORLD TO COME . WE WILL HAMMER OUT THE RULES AND DISCUSS THE ISSUES , AND IN A PEACEFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE FASHION CRAFT A NEW WORLD OUT OF THE ASHES OF THE OLD . WHAT DO YOU THINK ? IT WAS ... IT WAS GREAT . REALLY . YOU DON 'T THINKIT WAS OVER-WRITTEN ? NO , NO , IT 'S ... WELL , JUST A LITTLE . DON 'T YOU THINK YOU 'RE PUTTING A LITTLE TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON YOURSELF ? THIS IS WHAT WE 'VE BEEN WORKING ON EVER SINCE THE BIG DEATH . THIS IS A CHANCE TO PUT TOGETHER A NEW ALLIANCE THAT CAN START PUTTING THE COUNTRY BACK TOGETHER AGAIN . WE HAVE TO GETTHESE REGIONAL LEADERS TO SIGN ONTO THE IDEA OF A NEW CONSTITUTION , A NEW AMERICAN ALLIANCE , BECAUSE IF THEY DON 'T GO FOR IT , ALL OUR DREAMS END RIGHT HERE . IT HAS TO BE RIGHT . I KNOW , AND REALLY , IT 'S ... IT 'S ... INSPIRING . BASICALLY , WHATYOU 'RE SAYING ISI 'M A DEAD MAN . BASICALLY , YEAH . OKAY . LET THEM IN . OKAY , I 'LL LET THEM IN . ANY WORD ON HOW IT 'S GOING SO FAR ? NO , BUT MARKUS IS A GREAT TALKER , LIBBY . I MEAN , HE 'S THE BEST . I 'M SURE HE 'S GOT THESE PEOPLE EATING OUT OF HIS HAND BY NOW . DO YOU THINK ? ARE YOU KIDDING ? ABSOLUTELY . IF I DON 'T GET SOME PEACE AND QUIET SOON , SOMEONE 'S GOING TO GET THEIR ASS KICKED . MAYBE WE SHOULD COME BACK LATER . LATER IS GOOD . IT 'S BEEN 15 YEARS SINCE A STRANGE DISEASEWIPED OUT ALL OF THE ADULTS AND LEFT US KIDSTO FEND FOR OURSELVES . NOW I 'M MOVING AHEAD , THROUGH THE PAST . * I CAN 'T LET GO * I 'M HOLDING HOPE SO TIGHT * * IT 'S HARD TO BREATHE WHEN THE WHOLE WORLD FALLS * * I 'M GONNA PUT THE STARS BACK BACK UP IN THE SKY * * LET THEM ALL JUST SHINE DOWN I 'M GONNA TRY * * I BELIEVE WE 'LL FIND THE WORLD TOGETHER * * THROUGH YOUR EYES * THAT 'S ALL I CAN SEE * I BELIEVE WE 'RE LOOKING AT FOREVER * * IN A WORLD WHERE WE CAN BE FREE * * I BELIEVE ( MARKUS ) : I UNDERSTAND THAT UNTIL NOW YOU HAVEN 'T WANTED TO SHARE YOUR RESOURCES WITH OTHERS , BUT GUARANTEEING SAFE PASSAGE BETWEEN ALL THE GROUPS REPRESENTED HERE IS THE ONLY WAYWE CAN START PUTTING THIS COUNTRY BACK TOGETHER AGAIN . RIGHT NOW THAT 'S FROM THE WESTERN EDGE OF ARIZONA- - THAT 'S YOUR AREA , HERNANDEZ- - THROUGH MINNESOTA ON THE EAST . AND FREE PASSAGEMEANS FREE PASSAGE , SANDOR . NO WAY . LOOK , WE JUST BARELYGOT OURSELVES TOGETHER , AND WINTER 'S COMING . WE 'RE SHORT ON FOOD , SUPPLIES , YOU NAME IT , SO ANYBODY COMES THROUGH MY TURF WITH SUPPLIESFOR SOMEBODY ELSE , YOU HAVE TO PAY A TAX . THAT 'S NOT WORKABLE . AND HOW CAN WE PULL THE COUNTRY TOGETHER WHEN THE COUNTRY DOESN 'T EVEN HAVE A NAME YET ? SHOULDN 'T WE BE DOING THAT FIRST ? YEAH , I SAY WE CALL IT THE UNITED STATES OF ENRIQUE HERNANDEZ . HEY , YOUR ASS ISBIG ENOUGH TO BETHE COUNTRY , ALL RIGHT ? SO SIT YOURCOUNTRY ASS DOWN . YOU WANT A PIECE OF THIS , HUH , SANDOR ? DO I WANT A PIECE OF YOU ? SIT YOUR ASS DOWN . OKAY . LUNCH . GOT A SEC ? SURE , COME ON IN . SO , HOW 'S IT GOING WITH THE REST OF THE FOUNDING FATHERS ? UGLY . I JUST DON 'T THINKTHEY 'RE TAKING THISSERIOUSLY . WELL , SHOULD THEY ? SHOULDN 'T THEY ? THINK ABOUT IT . EVERYBODY IN THERE GOT TO WHERE THEY AREBY FIGHTING EVERYBODY ELSE . THEY HAVE PUSHED AND PULLED AND BIT AND SCRATCHED THEIR WAY INTO RUNNING A TOWN , AND THEN A COUPLE OF TOWNS , AND THEN MORE ... AND EVERY STEP OF THE WAY , THEY 'VE HAD SOMEBODY TRYING TO CON THEM OR TAKE IT ALL AWAY . NOW , YOU THINK GUYS LIKE THIS ARE GOING TO BEND OVERJUST ' CAUSE WE ASK THEM TO ? I KNOW , IT 'S JUST- - THEY WANT TO BELIEVE . THEY DO . YOU CAN SEE IT IN THEIR EYES . FOR 16 YEARS , THEY 'VE FOUGHTTO BUILD SOMETHING , AND THEY DON 'T WANT IT TO END WHEN THEY DIE . THEY WANT TO BELIEVEIN ALL OF THIS , JUST LIKE I DID WHEN I GOT HERE , BUT IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD , IT 'S HARD TO TRUST ANYBODY . SO WHAT DID YOU WANT TO SEE US ABOUT ? I NEED TO GET BACK ON THE ROAD . NOW , I KNOW WE 'VE ALL BEEN THROUGH A LOT LATELY , BUT I NEED TO GET AWAY FROM THIS PLACE . I MEAN , THE MEMORIES ... YOU KNOW ? YEAH . YEAH , I DO . OF COURSE , THAT MEANS FINDING YOU A NEW PARTNER , WITH YOU AND JEREMIAH SPLIT UP . YEAH , WELL , I HAVE A THOUGHT ON THAT ONE . YOU KNOW THE NEW GUY , SMITH ? THIS GUY THAT CALLS HIMSELFMISTER SMITH , THINKS GOD TALKS TO HIM ? YEAH , THAT ONE . KURDY , ASIDE FROM THE FACTTHAT HE 'S NEWAND UNTESTED , AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT ... I DON 'T KNOW , WHAT 'S A GOOD WORD ? NUTS ? NUTS . NUTS . EXCELLENT WORD . ASIDE FROM ALL OF THAT , THERE ARE BETTER PEOPLE . HE SAVED MY LIFE . TWICE . SO GIVE HIM A MEDAL OR A PIECE OF CAKE . WHENEVER THERE 'SSOMETHING WE WANT MARKUS TO DO , AND HE DOESN 'TWANT TO DO IT , WE TELL HIM THERE 'S CAKE INVOLVED . WORKS EVERY TIME . WHEN I WAS IN CHARGE OF THE PRISON BREAK IN MILLHAVEN , YOU TOLD ME TO PICK LIEUTENANTS I TRUSTED . I DIDN 'T KNOW YOU MEANT SMITH . HE SAVED MY LIFE , MARKUS , TWICE . NOW , I THINK HE 'S A LITTLE NUTS , TOO , BUT YOU SHOW ME ONE PERSON WHO DIDN 'T COME OUT OF THE BIG DEATH A LITTLE FUCKED UP . I TRUST THIS GUY , AND ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS HELP . THAT YOU WANT TO REPAY HIM FOR SAVING YOUR LIFE IS ADMIRABLE , BUT I HAVE TO KEEP FOCUS ON THE BIGGER PICTURE . PART OF THAT IS MAKING TEAM ASSIGNMENTS BASED ON WHAT 'S BEST FOR EVERYBODY , NOT JUST ONE PERSON . I BUST MY ASS FOR THIS PLACE , MARKUS . I RISK MY LIFE FOR THIS PLACE , AND YOU WANT TO BLOW ME OFF WITH " WHAT 'S BEST FOR EVERYBODY SHIT " ? HOW ABOUT WHAT 'S BEST TO KEEP ME ALIVE ? I UNDERSTAND YOUR PASSION , BUT THE DECISION IS MINE . I 'M SORRY , KURDY . HE SAID YES , RIGHT ? I TOLD YOU HE 'D SAY YES . GOD SAID I WAS GOING TO BE YOUR PARTNER . HE SAID NO , OKAY ? NO . AND THAT GOD BULLSHIT IS PROBABLYTHE BIGGEST REASON . I DON 'T UNDERSTAND . WHAT I HEAR , IT 'S NEVER WRONG . WELL , IT IS , AND MAYBE THAT SHOULD BE YOUR FIRST CLUE , SMITH . IT AIN 'T GOD , IT 'S JUST YOU . IT 'S JUST YOU , AND IT 'S JUST ME , AND I GOT THINGS TO DO , SO I WILLSEE YOU AROUND . * DON 'T BE AFRAID OF THE MOMENT * * THIS COULD BE THE CHANCE OF A LIFETIME * * ALL MY LIFE ... HEY . HI . SORRY . IT ISN 'T TOO LOUD , IS IT ? NO , NO . IT 'S , UM , IT 'S GREAT . IT 'S JUST , YOU KNOW , SINCE I GOT HERE , I 'VE NOTICED THERE 'S NOT A WHOLE LOT OF MUSIC AROUND . I FIGURED THERE WAS A RULE OR SOMETHING . THE SEARCH TEAMSHAD DIFFERENT PRIORITIES . THEY WERE LOOKING FOR FOOD , MEDICINE , SUPPLIES . MUSIC ISN 'T A PRIORITY ? I DON 'T KNOW HOW ANYONECOULD LIVE IN A WORLDWITHOUT MUSIC . IT MAKES ME FEEL ALIVE . DANCE WITH ME . NO . I--I DON 'T , UH , DANCE . DANCE WITH ME . * SLIP AWAY * SLIP AWAY * LET 'S NOT LET IT SLIP AWAY * * LET 'S NOT LET IT SLIP AWAY * * LET 'S NOT LET IT SLIP AWAY * * LET 'S NOT LET IT SLIP AWAY * WELL , THAT WASN 'T SO HARD , WAS IT ? SAYS YOU . YOU WERE LOOKING FOR ME . WHY ? I DON 'T REMEMBER . ARE YOU READY FOR ROUND TWO ? MM-HMM . GOOD , BECAUSE I 'VE NOTICED YOU 'VE BEEN PRETTY QUIET SO FAR . MM-HMM . WELL , THAT 'S HARDLY THE THEO WE 'VE ALL COME TO KNOW AND MOSTLY TOLERATE . MM-HMM . IS THAT ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY ? NEVER TALK WITH YOUR MOUTH FULL . YOUR MOTHER TELL YOU THAT ? NO , A HOOKER . I COULD 'VE GONE ALL DAY WITHOUT KNOWING THAT . OH . YOU ASKED . AND DON 'T WORRY , WHEN IT 'S TIME FOR THEO TO TALK , SHE 'LL TALK . YOU WANT A BITE ? NO . MARKUS , GOOD . UH , LEE , NOW IS NOT A GOOD TIME . I JUST THOUGHTYOU SHOULD KNOW . EVERYBODY COMING HERE FOR THE MEETING HAS BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR , EXCEPT THE MINNESOTA GROUP . THEY MAY BE IN TROUBLE . AND THIS IS BASED ON ? THEY WERE KEEPING IN RADIO CONTACT WITH THEIR HOME BASE EVERY COUPLE OF HOURS . THEY SIGNED OFF THIS MORNING AND HAVEN 'T BEEN HEARD FROM SINCE , AND IT 'S IN AN AREA NORTH OF HERE THAT 'S HAD OTHER REPORTS OF PEOPLE DISAPPEARING . OKAY , I 'LL LOOK INTO IT , BUT LEE , YOU 'RE NOT HEAD OF SECURITY ANYMORE . YOUR PEOPLE STILL THINKTHEY WORK FOR YOU , BUT IN THE FUTURE , ANY TIME YOU GET INFORMATION LIKE THIS BEFORE I GET IT , YOU 'LL BOTHBE OUT OF HERE . AM I CLEAR ? KURDY , GOOD , THANKS FOR COMING . YOU KNOW TRENT , RIGHT ? HE 'S BEEN ATTACHED TO ONE OF OUR LONG-RANGE SURVEY TEAMS . HOW YOU DOING ? FINE . TRENT 'S YOUR NEW PARTNER . SO WHAT 'S THE JOB ? THERE WERE ABOUT SIX PEOPLE COMING HERE FROM MINNESOTA . THEY FELL OFF THE EDGE OF THE WORLD ABOUT A HUNDRED MILES NORTH FROM HERE . THERE 'S BEEN NO WORD , NO EXPLANATION . EVEN THEIR OWN PEOPLE DON 'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED , SO THEY MIGHT BE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE , AND I NEED YOU TO FIND THEM . FINE . THIS IS WHERE THEY WERE LAST SEEN , SO MY GUESS IS THEY DISAPPEARED ALONG THIS STRETCH OF ROAD RIGHT HERE . ALL RIGHT , I 'M ON IT . AND I 'LL GET BACK TO THE ZOO NOW . OKAY , SEE YOU LATER . YOU READY TO GO ? I WAS BORN READY . TRUST ME , KURDY , IN THE YEARS TO COME , YOU 'LL LOOK BACK AT THE DAY , YOU GOT ME AS YOUR PARTNER AS THE LUCKIEST DAY IN YOUR LIFE . WELL , IF THIS IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS , I MIGHT AS WELL KILL MYSELF NOW TO GET IT OVER WITH . HEY , YOU 'RE A LOT BETTER OFF THAN YOU WERE WITH YOUR OLD PARTNER . WHOA . COME ON , JEREMIAH 'S A FLAKE , EVERYBODY KNOWS IT . LET 'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT , TRENT . EVERY TIME I WAS IN A PLACE WHERE I THOUGHT I WAS NOT GOING TOGET OUT OF THERE ALIVE , THERE WAS ALWAYS A LITTLE PART OF MY BRAIN TELLING ME , " DON 'T WORRY ABOUT IT . JEREMIAH WILL HAVE MY BACK , " AND IN EVERY SITUATION , HE DID , SO YOU HAVEA LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE YOU PROVE THE SAME THING TO ME , AND MEANWHILE , YOU GOT SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT JEREMIAH , KEEP IT TO YOURSELF . LOOK , MARKUS , YOU 'RE LIVING IN A DREAM WORLD IF YOU THINK , WE CAN JUST SIGN OFF ON THIS SHIT . " THE RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL " TO OWN AND POSSESS PRIVATE PROPERTY SHALL NOT BE ABRIDGED BY THE STATE . " WHAT 'S WRONG WITH THAT ? FOR 16 YEARS , THE ONLY WAYYOU COULD KEEP SOMETHING WAS IF YOU WERESTRONG ENOUGHTO HOLD ONTO IT . IT 'S NOT LIKE YOU COULD CALL THE POLICE . THAT 'S MY POINT . YOU WANT TO ENFORCETHIS STUFF ? YOU WANT TO PUT SOME KIND OF LAME-ASS POLICE FORCE TOGETHER , PAY FOR IT , ALL THAT SHIT ? I SAY IF YOU GOT A PROBLEM , YOU DEAL WITH IT YOURSELF , ONE ON ONE . IF YOU 'RE NOT STRONG ENOUGHTO DEFEND YOURSELF , YOU DESERVE WHAT YOU GET . NOBODY EVER GAVE ME A HAND COMING UP . I HAD TO FIGHT FOR EVERYTHING I GOT . NOW YOU 'RE STARTING TO SOUND LIKE DANIEL . " ONLY THE STRONG SURVIVE . " LOOK , SANDOR , JUST BECAUSE I DON 'T BUY INTO EVERYTHING DANIEL SAYS DOESN 'T MEAN HE 'S WRONG ABOUT THE REST . NOW , WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK ? YOU 'RE SANDOR ? YEAH . JEREMIAH . HEARD YOUWANTED TO SEE ME . YEAH , I DO . COME ON , LET 'S STEP OUTSIDE . SO , THE WORD ON THE STREET IS THAT YOU 'RE GONNA TAKE OVER THAT PLACE VALHALLA SECTOR USED TO RUN , MILLHAVEN . THAT TRUE ? WELL , MAYBE . WHY ? LOT OF TRADEGOES THROUGH MILLHAVEN . YEAH . A GUY COULD DO REAL GOOD FOR HIMSELF IN A SETUP LIKE THAT , REAL GOOD . YOU STICK WITH MARKUS , YOU 'LL DO OKAY , BUT ONCE YOU 'RE THERE , YOU 'RE THERE , YOU KNOW WHAT I 'M SAYING ? YOU COULD WORK WITHANYBODY YOU WANT , MAKE ANY DEAL YOU WANT . SO IF YOU EVER DECIDE YOU WANT TO LEAVE MARKUS AND WORK WITHSOMEBODY ELSE , YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME . YOU HELP ME , I HELP YOU , EVERYBODY WINS . EVERYBODY EXCEPT MARKUS . I HEARD YOU WERE A SMART GUY . I JUST THOUGHTMAYBE WE COULD COME TO SOME KIND OF MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING . WE JUST DID . THEO ? ( RETCHING ) ( TOILET FLUSHING ) UH , THEO ... ANYBODY EVER EXPLAIN THE CONCEPT OF PRIVACY TO YOU ? THE DOOR WAS OPEN . AN INCH . ONE INCH , BUT I CAN SEE HOW YOU COULD LOOK AT AN INCH AND THINK IT WASA LOT MORE . SO WHAT DO YOU WANT ? I KEEP HEARING ABOUT THIS GUY , DANIEL . THE WAY EVERYBODY TALKS , HE SOUNDS LIKE A PRETTY BIG GUY . I FIGURED IF ANYBODY 'D KNOW ABOUT HIM , YOU WOULD . WHY DON 'T YOU ASK MARKUS ? HE 'S HEARD OF DANIEL , SAME AS ME . MARKUS IS BUSY . I JUST FOUND OUT , SO YOU 'RE THE ONEI 'M ASKING , UNLESS YOU 'RE TOO BUSY IN THERE , BLOWING CHUNKS . WHY DON 'T YOU GO TO WHATEVER 'S LEFT OF THE EAST COAST , AND ASK ABOUT DANIEL , OR THE TALL MAN . HE GOES BY THAT ONE , TOO . THEY SAY HE 'S LIKE ONE OF THOSE GUYS FROM OUT OF THE OLD WORLD , TALL AND STRAIGHT , GOOD TEETH , AND EYES THAT SEE STRAIGHT THROUGH YOU TILL SUNDAY , AND WHEN HE SPEAKS , YOU LISTEN . HE 'S BUILDING SOMETHING OUT THERE , SOMETHING BIG AND SCARY . SCARY HOW ? DEPENDS ON WHO YOU TALK TO . THEY SAY HE 'S GOT THESE SLAVE LABOR CAMPS GOING , AND ANYBODY WHO GOES INTO HIS TERRITORY WITHOUT ANY KINDOF RESOURCES , THEY GRAB ' EM UP AND PUT ' EM TO WORK . IS HE PART OF A GROUP LIKE THIS ? LIKE THIS ONE ? OH , NO . FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND , DANIEL WOULD NEVER PUT UP WITH THE KIND OF BULLSHIT WE GOT GOING ON HERE . OH , NO . YOU DON 'T ARGUEWITH DANIEL AND LIVE . THERE 'S NO STATES , NO GROUPS , JUST DANIEL , AND ALL THE PEOPLETHAT DECIDED TO FOLLOW HIM , PUT HIM IN CHARGE . PRESIDENT , DICTATOR , NUMBER ONE , CALL HIM WHATEVER YOU LIKE- - IT 'S NOT GOOD . THE THING IS , I 'VE HEARD STORIES LIKE THIS BEFORE AND IT ALWAYS TURNS OUT TO BE A BUNCH OF BULL . HAVE YOU EVER ACTUALLY SEEN DANIEL ? NOPE . THEN HOW DO YOU EVEN KNOW HE 'S REAL ? WHEN I WAS A YOUNG GIRL , I WAS LIVING UP BY WYOMING . WE HAD A FLOOD , REAL BAD . IT WASHED OUT HOUSES , TREES , AND A WHOLE SIDE OF A HILL , AND WHERE THAT HILL USED TO BE , WE SAW THESE FOOTPRINTS , REAL OLD AND REAL BIG , LIKE THIS BIG AROUND . DINOSAUR FOOTPRINTS . AND THEY HAD TO BE THERE FOR , LIKE ... WELL , FORA VERY LONG TIME . NOW , YOU ASK ME , I EVER SEE A DINOSAUR ? NO , BUT I CAN LOOK AT THOSE FOOTPRINTS , AND I KNOW SURE AS HELLSOMETHING MADE ' EM , SOMETHING BIG . AND YOU ASK ME IF I EVER SEE DANIEL ? NO ... BUT I HAVE SEEN THE TRAIL HE LEAVES WHERE HE WALKS , AND THE EFFECTHE HAS ON OTHER PEOPLE , AND THEY MARK THE PASSING OF SOMETHING AWFULLY BIG , AND AWFULLY DANGEROUS . SO THIS IS THE BORDER BETWEEN WHAT 'S WEIRD AND WHAT AIN 'T . OUR PEOPLE DISAPPEARED SOMEWHERE BETWEEN HERE AND THE NEXT 30-40 MILES , SO I FIGURE 20 MINUTES TO STRETCH OUR LEGS , TAKE A WHIZ , THEN WE MOVE ON . I DON 'T WANT TO WASTE TIME . GOOD , BECAUSE I 'M KNOWN FOR THE WHOLE TIME-WASTING THING . YOU KNOW , ADMITTING YOUR PROBLEM IS THE FIRST STEPTOWARD DEALING WITH IT . SOMETHING BOTHERING YOU ? BESIDES YOU ? I KEEP GETTINGTHIS FEELING LIKE THERE 'S SOMEBODY FOLLOWING US . RIGHT , LIKE THERE 'S SOMEBODY FOLLOWING US ON FOOT . HEY . HOW 'S IT GOING ? I SEE YOU 'RE PACKING UP . GUESS SINCE YOU AND KURDY AREN 'T WORKING TOGETHER FOR A WHILE , THEY WANT YOU SOMEWHERE ELSE . YEAH , MOVING 'SALWAYS A HASSLE . ANYWAY , WE HAVEN 'T HAD MUCH CHANCE TO TALK SINCE WE GOT BACK , SO I THOUGHT I 'D SEEHOW YOU WERE DOING . SEE , THE PROBLEM IS , I NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN WHAT I WAS DOING , AND WHY . MARKUS IS A GREAT GUY , BUT HE 'S STRONG-WILLED . IF I 'D LET HIM KNOW ABOUT THE BROTHERS OF THE APOCALYPSE , ABOUT MILLHAVEN , HE WOULD 'VE GONE OUT THERE AND BROUGHT VALHALLA SECTOR DOWN ON US BEFORE WE WERE READY FOR THEM . HE ALWAYS LEADS WITH HIS CHIN , YOU KNOW ? LOOK , I GAVE YOUR DAD THE INFORMATION HE NEEDED TO MAKE SURE WE STAYED CLEAR OF TROUBLE , AND I GAVE VALHALLA SECTOR JUST ENOUGH INFORMATION TO MAKE THEM THINK WE WEREN 'T A THREAT TO THEM . I WAS BUYING TIME FOR ALL OF US . I THOUGHT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO . I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP . WHETHER HE KNOWS IT OR NOT , MARKUS NEEDS ME RUNNING SECURITY AGAIN . I 'M THE ONLY ONE HE CAN TRUST . I NEED YOUR HELP , JEREMIAH . I NEED YOU TO TALK TO MARKUS FOR ME . IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO ? SHORT OF CONTRACTING A LINGERING DISEASE , RESULTING IN A PAINFUL DEATH WITH LOTS OF KICKING AND SCREAMING , NOT A THING . THEN I GUESS WE HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON . NEITHER OF US KNOWS WHERE WE FIT IN ANYMORE . HEY , TRENT . WAS THAT FIRE GOING WHEN WE PULLED UP ? 'CAUSE I DON 'T REMEMBER SEEING IT . HOW THE HELL SHOULD I KNOW ? HEY , KURDY.CHECK IT OUT . I SPELLED MY NAME OUT . OH , GOOD . YOU FOUND IT . ARE YOU HUNGRY ? WANT SOMETHING TO EAT ? WHAT ARE- - HOW THE HELL DID- - WHAT ? YOU 'RE HERE . GOOD OBSERVATION . YOU WERE JUST AT THE MOUNTAIN . GOOD MEMORY . SO HOW THE HELLDID YOU GETFROM THERE TO HERE ? I HAVE WAYS . LOOK , SMITH , I DON 'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL IT IS YOU THINK YOU 'RE DOING- - I 'M NOT DOING ANYTHING . YOU 'RE FOLLOWING ME . I 'M YOUR PARTNER . YOU ARE NOT MY PARTNER.DO I HAVE TO DRAWA PICTURE FOR YOU ? NO . WANT ME TO TAKE YOUR PICTURE ? WHAT ? IT 'S A PINHOLE CAMERA . I USE IT TO CHRONICLE WHERE I 'VE BEEN , WHAT I 'VE SEEN . SOMETIMES I KEEP THE PICTURES . SOMETIMESI GIVE THEM AWAY . SOMETIMES I JUST TEAR THEM UP . WHY ? BECAUSETHEY 'RE NO GOOD ? NO , IT 'S JUST THAT SOMETIMES THERE ARE THINGS IN THE PICTURES THAT SHOULDN 'T BE THERE . I 'LL SHOW YOUHOW IT WORKS . ( ENGINE TURNING OVER ) HEY , IF HE 'S LEAVING WITHOUT ME- - YOU KNOW , I COULD- - NO , NO . YOU STAY RIGHT THERE . DON 'T MOVE . HEY , TRENT . WHAT THE HELLARE YOU- - TRENT ... TRENT , ARE YOU OKAY ? WE KNOW WHO YOU 'RE LOOKING FOR . YOUR FRIEND HERE FILLED US IN WHILE YOU WERE ASLEEP . IT JUST TOOK A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT , BUT WE GOT THE JOB DONE . YOU LOOKING FORYOUR PEOPLE ? WE 'VE GOT SOME OF THEM RIGHT UP THERE IN THOSE CAGES . THOSE THAT 'RE LEFT , ANYWAY . BEFORE THE OTHERS DIED , THEY TOLD US WHAT WAS GOING ON , THAT THE GOVERNMENT 'SCOMING BACK , LAW 'S COMING BACK . WE DON 'T WANTANY PART OF THAT . WE USED TO WORK ALONE , ME AND THE GUYS , THEN WE FOUND EACH OTHER , STARTED WORKING TOGETHER . SEE , FOLKS THINK THAT PEOPLE LIKE US DON 'T EXIST ANYMORE , THAT WE 'RE PARTOF SOME BAD MEMORY . THAT MAKES THEM STUPID . MOST PEOPLE ARE STUPID . THAT 'S WHY THEY DON 'T DESERVE TO LIVE . I LOVE TO KILL PEOPLE . ALL OF US HERE , WE LOVE TO WATCH THEM DIE . SOMETIMES I 'LL SHOOTSOMEBODY IN THE HEAD , AND WATCH THEMWRIGGLE AND SQUIRMALL OVER THE PLACE . T.K. HERE , HE LIKES TO CUT ' EM , LOTS OF LITTLE CUTS , THEN BIGGER CUTS , UNTIL THEIR FACES TURN ALL WHITE . WE CATCH ' EM , BRING ' EM HERE , AND CAGE ' EM , JUST LIKE YOU GUYS RIGHT NOW , AND WE DO IT TO ' EM BECAUSE WE CAN , ' CAUSE THEY 'RE STUPID . QUESTION IS , ARE YOU GUYSSMART ENOUGH TO DOTHE RIGHT THING ? I WANT YOU TO GO BACK AND TELL YOUR PEOPLE THAT THE KILLING THEY 'RE GONNA SEE HERE TODAY IS JUST A START IF YOU DON 'T LEAVE US ALONE , LET US KEEP DOING WHAT WE 'RE DOING , 'CAUSE WE 'VE GOT A LOT MORE PEOPLE LIKE US COMING , AND WE GOT PLANS , BIG PLANS . WE GOT ALL KINDS OF WEAPONS , AND WE 'LL COME AND KILL YOU IN YOUR SLEEP . WE 'LL KILL ALL YOUR PEOPLE WHEN THEY COME THROUGH HERE . WE WANT TO SENDTHAT MESSAGE BACK TO WHERE YOU GUYS COME FROM , SO WE 'RE GOING TO LETONE OF YOU GUYS GO , JUST ONE . YOU DECIDE WHO GOES AND WHO STAYS . NOT A CHANCE . YOU LET BOTH OF US GO OR NOBODY GOES , OR YOU CAN GO STRAIGHT- - I 'LL DO IT . WHAT ? I 'LL GO . GOOD MAN . SMART MAN . BUT WE GOT TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO TAKE BACK WITH YOU , SO YOUR PEOPLE KNOW WE MEAN WHAT WE SAY . CUT OFF HIS HAND . RIGHT HAND , LEFT HAND , WHATEVER . I GOT A BETTER IDEA . HEY , CHECK IT OUT . SMITH ? GET THE HELL OUTTA HERE , MAN . SHUT UP . WHAT DO YOU WANT ? TAKE ME INSTEAD . LET HIM GO . IT DOESN 'T WORK LIKE THAT . IT 'S NOT WHO GOES , WHO STAYS , IT 'S ONE GOES , AND WHOEVER 'S LEFT STAYS , AND WE DO WHAT WE WANT WITH ' EM . YOU 'RE ONE STUPID SON OF A GUN , YOU KNOW ? NO . ACTUALLY , I KNOWA LOT OF THINGSYOU DON 'T KNOW . OH , YEAH ? AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW THAT I DON 'T KNOW ? YOU WATCH THOSE TWO . YOU ARE COMING WITH ME . NO , NO ! NO ! HOW DO YOU KNOW HER NAME ? HUH ? HOW THE HELL DO YOU KNOW HER NAME ? I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR YOU . NOT JUST FOR YOU , ABOUT YOU . ALL ABOUT YOU . GOD SAYS , " YOU CAN 'T HIDE . " MY EYE SEES YOU " AND ALL THE DARKNESS THAT 'S INSIDE OF YOU . LISTEN . LISTEN ... " ( * * ) HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU . NOW ! HE KNEW EVERYTHING . HE KNEW IT ALL . THERE 'S ONLY ONE WAY OUT . JUST ONE WAY . ALL RIGHT , YOU GUYS ARE SAFE NOW . COME ON . HEY . HEY , YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO ASK ME ? NO , BUT I DO HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION . YOU GOT A MINUTE ? YEAH , SURE , I 'M JUST KILLING TIME BEFORE YOUR DAD GETS BACK FROM VALHALLA SECTOR AND PUTS ME TO WORK . GOOD , BECAUSE THAT 'S WHAT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT . LISTEN , DID MY DAD EVER SAY ANYTHING ABOUT LEE WORKING FOR HIM ? SOMETIMES . I KIND OF GOT THE FEELING IT WAS A TOUCHY ISSUE , THAT THERE WERE TIMES THAT DEVON DIDN 'T KNOW IF HE COULD REALLY TRUST LEE . SO , WHAT , YOU THINK LEE WAS HOLDING STUFF BACK FROM HIM , JUST LIKE HE WAS FROM US ? THIS ONE TIME , THEY HAD A REALLY BIG ARGUMENT , ABOUT YOU , ACTUALLY . LEE WAS SUPPOSED TO BRING MARKUS INTO THE WHOLE LOOP ABOUT VALHALLA SECTOR AND WHO DEVON REALLY WAS AROUND THE MIDDLE OF LAST YEAR . AT THE LAST MINUTE , YOU KNOW , DEVON CHANGED HIS MIND , SAID HE KNEW THAT IF YOU FOUND OUTHE WAS ALIVE , YOU 'D HEAD TO VALHALLA LIKE A BULLET , AND THINGS WOULD END UP , WELL ... GOING PRETTY MUCHABOUT AS WRONGAS THEY ENDED UP GOING . SO YOU 'RE SAYING THAT I 'M THE REASON HE LIED TO MARKUS ? YOU 'RE JUST THE REASONHE KEPT LYING TO MARKUS WHEN THE TIME TO TELL THE TRUTH HAD COME . YOU DID GOOD , KURDY.IT WASN 'T ME , IT WAS THE GUY YOU THOUGHT WAS TOO NUTS TO WORK WITH ME , REMEMBER ? YEAH , I REMEMBER , AND IT GOT ME TO THINKING . WE ALL HAVE TO MAKE OUR OWN CHOICES . I MADE ONE FOR YOU , AND IT NEARLY GOT YOU KILLED , SO I THINK FROM NOW ON , MAYBE YOU CAN CHOOSE YOUR OWN PARTNERS . IF THEY 'RE GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU , THEY 'RE GOODENOUGH FOR ME . I 'M NOT SAYING WE DON 'T HAVE OUR DIFFERENCES . I 'M NOT SAYINGIT 'S GOING TO BE EASY TO WORK THOSEDIFFERENCES OUT . I 'M JUST SAYING THAT WE STAND A BETTER CHANCE OF WORKING THEM OUT TOGETHER THAN AS SEPARATE GROUPS , EATING UP WHAT 'S LEFT OF OUR RESOURCES . I 'VE DEDICATED MY LIFE TO THE IDEA OF BRINGING THE GOVERNMENT BACK , MAYBE BETTER THAN IT WAS BEFORE , MORE TOLERANT , KINDER , A GOVERNMENT THAT LIFTS UP INSTEAD OF GRINDS DOWN , THAT ENNOBLES US AND GIVES USTHE ONLY GIFTSTHAT REALLY MATTER- - DIGNITY , COURAGE , HOPE . WE 'RE NOT GOING TO SOLVE ALL OUR DIFFERENCES HERE TODAY , BUT WE 'VE HAD A CHANCE TO HEAR FROM EVERYBODY . NOW COMES THE TIME TO DECIDE ON THE QUESTION BEFORE US . ARE YOU , ALL OF YOU , WILLING , TODAY , TO UNITE INTO A NEW AMERICAN ALLIANCE ? I WANT US TO DECIDE , YES OR NO . MARKUS , TRUTH IS , WE HAVEN 'T HEARDFROM EVERYBODY , SO LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION . IS THERE SOMETHING YOU DON 'T WANT US TO HEAR ? NO . ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO SPEAK CAN DO SO , IT 'S JUST THAT- - THEN CHECK YOUR FRONT DOOR , AND OPEN IT . COMPANY 'S COMING . HI . GOOD TO SEE YOU . MY NAME ... IS VINCENT , AND WE HEARD ABOUT THIS GATHERING ALL THE WAYBACK ON THE EAST COAST . " WE " BEING DANIEL , AND THOSE OF US WHO BELIEVE IN HIM . NOW , WE 'VE HEARD THAT THINGS HAVEN 'T BEEN GOING TOO WELL HERE , THAT THERE 'S BEEN SOME DISAGREEMENTS , PROBLEMS . WELL , THAT 'S ONLY NATURAL , AND BOUND TO OCCURIN THE ABSENCE OFA STRONG LEADER . SO ... DANIEL SENT ME TO EXTEND YOU HIS PERSONAL INVITATION . JOIN WITH US . WE 'VE MADEQUITE A COMEBACK . WE HAVE MUCH TO OFFER . AND HOW HAVE YOU MADE THIS COMEBACK ? I 'M SORRY ? THROUGH HARD WORK AND DISCIPLINE . AND , FROM WHAT I HEAR , IT 'S SLAVE LABOR . WE HAVE CREATED A WORK FORCE FROM THOSE WHO HAD NO OTHER OPTIONS ANYWAY . WE GAVE THEM PURPOSE . WE HAVE DIRECTION . THEY NEED DIRECTION . IT 'S WIN-WIN ALL THE WAY . FOR DANIEL , SURE . FROM THE WAYI UNDERSTAND IT , HE SET HIMSELF UP AS A BENIGN DICTATOR , IF THERE IS SUCH A THING . DANIEL WAS GIVENTHE REINS OF POWERFREELY , BY THE PEOPLE . ONE LEADER , ONE VOICE . DANIEL SPEAKSFOR ALL OF US , AND THINGS GET DONE , BUT WE 'RE WILLING TO SHARE , TO INVITE YOUTO JOIN US AND CREATEA NEW AND BETTER WORLD . CAN I SAY SOMETHING ? YOU 'RE THEO , AREN 'T YOU ? WE 'VE HEARDA LOT ABOUT YOU . NOW , THE PROBLEMWITH MARKUS IS THAT HE KIND OFPUT THE CARTBEFORE THE HORSE , BECAUSE HE DIDN 'T THINK THAT HE COULD SELL US ON HIM . HE COULD HAVE USED FORCE , BECAUSE THIS PLACE HAS ALL THE FORCE , ALL THE NUKES , ANYBODY COULD ASK FOR , BUT HE DIDN 'T . HE TRIED TO SELL USON HIS IDEAS , BUT PEOPLE DON 'T FOLLOW IDEAS . THEY FOLLOW THE MANWHO HAS THE IDEAS . EVEN IF THAT MAN IS LESS THAN PERFECT ? HELL , YEAH . I DON 'T WANT TO FOLLOW SOMEBODY PERFECT , 'CAUSE I LIKE TELLING PEOPLE WHEN THEY 'RE WRONG , AND BEING ECCENTRIC THAT WAY IS JUST ONE OF THE PERKS YOU GET WHEN YOU 'RE PREGNANT . YOU DIDN 'T SAY ANYTHING . WASN 'T ANYBODY 'S BUSINESS TILL NOW , AND THE THING IS , I WANT MY CHILD TO GROW UP IN A BETTER WORLD THAN THE ONE I GOT STUCK WITH , AND I HAVETO ASK MYSELF , WHO IS GOING TO DO THAT FOR ME ? YOU ? I 'D RATHER FOLLOW THE MAN WHO HAS THE POWER AND DOESN 'T USE IT , WHO HAS THE IDEAS , WHO THINKS THAT THEY 'RE BETTER THAN HE IS , THAN THE MAN WHO LIKES POWER TOO MUCH AND WILL DO ANYTHING TO GET IT , THE MAN WHO THINKS THAT HE IS BIGGER THAN THE IDEAS . I AM WITH MARKUSAND HIS ALLIANCE . ANYBODY WANTS OUT , LEAVE NOW , AND DON 'T LET THE DOOR HIT YOU IN THE ASS ON THE WAY OUT ... BUT IF YOU WANT TO STAY AND UNITE BEHIND MARKUS , THEN STAND UP AND LET 'S SEE WHAT YOU 'VE GOT . WE 'VE COME ALL THIS WAY . ARE WE GOING TO CREATE A NEW WORLD RIGHT NOW OR NOT ? STAND UP . CONGRATULATIONS , PEOPLE . YOU JUST BECAME THE GOVERNMENT . YOU , UH ... YOU WILL LOSE IN THE END , YOU KNOW . SEE IF YOU STILL FEEL THAT WAY THE DAY YOU OPEN YOUR EYES AND SEE US MARCHON THIS PLACE , HUH ? YOU WANTED TO SEE ME ? YES , LEE . WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT YOU . SO WHEN 'S THE HANGING ? WELL , YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY . GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT , THEY SHOW UP EVERY TIME . THERE ISN 'T GOING TO BE A HANGING , LEE . IN FACT , YOU MAY BE SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT JEREMIAHWAS JUST TALKINGIN YOUR FAVOR . WHY THE CHANGE OF HEART ? THAT 'S BETWEENMARKUS AND ME . LET 'S JUST SAY THERE 'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT SIDES TO THIS THING . IF YOU CAN DOSOME GOOD- - AND THAT 'S A BIG " IF , " AS FAR AS I 'M CONCERNED , BUT I 'M NOT GOINGTO STAND IN THE WAY OF IT- - IF MARKUS KNOWS WHERE HE CAN USE YOU , I WON 'T OPPOSE IT . SO WHERE DO I STAND ? MY OPTIONS ARE SEVERAL-FOLD . I COULD REINSTATE YOU AS HEAD OF SECURITY , RETURN YOU TO THE GENERAL POPULATION WITHOUT RANK , IMPRISON YOU FOR AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF TIME , SEND YOU OUT OF THE MOUNTAIN , NEVER TO RETURN . TO BE HONEST , I 'M FAVORING THE LAST TWO OPTIONS , AND I 'M STILL NOT SURE IF THAT MIGHT NOT BE BEST . YOU CAN STAY HERE AT THE MOUNTAIN ON A PROBATIONARY BASIS , BUT YOU 'RE NO LONGER HEAD OF SECURITY . THAT ROLE GOES TO ERIN . AS FAR AS I 'M CONCERNED , YOU 'RE JUST ANOTHERPAIR OF HANDS TO DO THE WORK AHEAD OF US . IN TIME , I HOPE YOU 'LL EARN BACK MY TRUST , BUT WE 'LL HAVE TO SEE . THAT 'S ALL . HEY , KURDY , LISTEN , I WANT YOU TO BE MORE CAREFUL WITH MY VEHICLES , OKAY ? IT CAME BACK ALL MESSED UP . NOT MY FAULT . YEAH , IT 'S ALWAYSSOMEBODY ELSE . WE EVEN HAD A CAR GO MISSING . WHAT ? WHEN ? THE SAME TIME YOU LEFT . I 'D BROUGHT IT IN TO DO SOME WORK ON IT , THEN IT WAS GONE . NEXT THING I KNOW , IT 'S BACK AGAIN TODAY . SO THAT 'S HOW HE DID IT . .SO MUCH FOR THAT " I HAVE MY WAYS " MYSTERIOSO SHIT . I DON 'T CARE WHAT HE SAYS . IT 'S STILL PRETTY MYSTERIOSO , IF YOU ASK ME . WE DON 'T HAVE MUCH GAS TO WASTE , SO WHEN WE BRING IN THE CARS FOR WORK , WE DRAINALL THE GAS OUT . THERE WAS NO GAS IN THAT CARWHEN IT WENT OUT , NO GAS IN IT WHEN IT CAME BACK . HOW IT WENT ANYWHEREIS ANYBODY 'S GUESS . IT 'S STARTING .

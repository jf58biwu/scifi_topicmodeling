 Previously on Farscape . Why are we searching for this planet ? Jool told us every few cycles , the magnetics drop low enough for the dig team to remain there for a while . D 'Argo ! Three of these probes , which form the Darnaz Triangle , were launched by enemies of peace . Legend has it if I find the third probe , I can reverse its damage . This is Instructor Vella . A Carver can be perilous . Why didn 't you stand up for me ? If all the priests died here , why are there no bones ? See the Darnaz probes . It 's Peacekeeper code . What are you going to do ? I 'm going to warn the others so they can hide . No ! She 's like in the wall ? Peacekeepers . He 'll never bother you again . What do you want from me ? What I want ... may not be as bad as you think . What are you doing ? Whatever you want . Whatever . You can have it . Do you know where the final probe landed ? Yeah . Somehow I showed you ... what you must not know . He has to die . Has to . He had to die . He 'll never tell you now . And now on Farscape . There he is . Over here . Closer ! You 're with Grayza . You 'll give her the Darnaz Probes . Look , Grayza doesn 't give a rat 's ass ... I saw you with her . Grayza doesn 't give a damn about probes . She just wants what 's in my head . Vella was my friend . I 'll not let you take what she discovered . You 'll not give it to them ! Get off me , you son of a bitch ! I 'm not gonna tell anybody I saw where the probe is ! You saw it ? It 's buried , but I 'm not gonna tell anybody . Tell me where ! Where is the final probe ? My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . Three years ago I got shot through a wormhole . I 'm in a distant part of the universe aboard this living ship of escaped prisoners , my friends . I 've made enemies . Powerful , dangerous . Now all I want is to find a way home to warn Earth . Look upward and share the wonders I 've seen . What are you doing ? ! I told you to find him , not drown him . Now get off ! Oh ! - Here . What ? Whoa ! Back in the box for you , my ... Oh ! What is with the stench ? I don 't smell anything . Maybe that is the reason . Maybe that 's the reason what ? It could not be . You know her . She starts sentences , then she doesn 't finish them . It 's very annoying ! The reason what ? You know , you and Grayza with the ... You know about that ? John , everyone knows . Oh , no . I must be wrong , but Heppel oil ? That 's a myth . It would explain the smell . What are you guys talking about ? Dellos concubines have a gland implanted that creates Heppel oil . Its perfume targets the erogenous zones and it makes you ... Yeah , I know what it does . But Grayza would never desire it . Why not ? - Well , its effects are irreversible . Once the gland has been implanted , the concubines die cycles before their time . Yeah , she touched me . Aah , man ! I 'm not going anywhere near that woman again . John , you have to see her one more time . Screw you ! Well , to use one of your expressions , you 're gonna have to take one for the team . Technically , I 've taken two . And now it 's time for the triple . Listen . She still has Jool and Chiana , and we have a plan to get ' em out . Yes ? We are operating on a need to know basis and we think it best that you only know your part . Excuse me ? Well , we feel if you know the whole plan then ... What , you ... you two work it out , and come up with a plan . Now you trust her and you 're not gonna tell me the plan ? ! Well , let me tell you . I do not get back in the saddle with Mata Hari until I get the whole plan . If you go back , can you be sure Grayza will not make you tell everything you know ? You know it 's the right thing to do , John . Fine . What do you want me to do ? Okay . The Marauders are prepping to go . We think they wanna take you with them . You have to keep Grayza busy for about two arns . From what we have seen , that should not be too hard . Trust me , it 'll be hard . What am I supposed to do in two arns ? Just wait for my signal . - Right . And John , when they find you , it 's gonna have to be believable . You know , that you 're hurt , that you 've taken a fall . You can do that ? I can fake that . I can fake it . - Now , they have to ... I said I can fake it . Okay , okay . Are you sure ? I 'm sure . Okay . Oh , you bast ... He 's alive . I let you walk unguarded and you repay me by trying to escape . I 'm not Steve McQueen . I wasn 't trying to escape . I thought someone was throwing me off a cliff . I live in a strange universe . Things like that are fairly normal . You tell me why the Scarrans want you so badly and I will find your love . Aeryn Sun . Aeryn ? Drink . I thought you were gonna get Crichton to help us ! He had to die . No other way . I didn 't think you were gonna try and kill him , Wrinkles ! We 're all gonna die soon . Frata ! - Psst ! What ? The magnetics . You see how the colors are fading from everything ? The walls , your clothes . I never had much color to start with , Princess . But don 't you feel it ? How you 're getting hotter ? If we stay in here any longer , we 'll all be dead in ten arns . The flesh cooked off our bones . Great ! Just great . I am stuck here with the suicide tralks . I 'm not gonna let you get me down . I ... I am gonna to get us out of this . All right , who is in charge ? Captain ... I am your promotion . Rygel , I 'm docked . Meet me in the Transport Hangar . If you can get Elack to crash into the Marauders on the planet , we might be able to escape in the explosion wake , or at least far enough so the Command Carrier can 't track us . Crichton know about this plan ? He may not wanna go along with it , but we have no other option . Can you convince the old Pilot to do it ? I think so . No matter what , she knows she 's soon to die . You know why this plan is going to fail ? Rygel ... Sikozu will betray us again . Do you really think you can trust that female to do her part ? I have no choice . I know they 're always out there . In the sky . Waiting . If these wormholes are always there , why can 't they be seen ? It 's that ... they 're like this . Invisible . Sometimes , under the right conditions , they turn and appear . I just don 't know how to make them appear . And do you think it 's worth risking your life ... - Ma 'am ? ... to find out about these wormholes ? - Ma 'am ? Go away . Um ... It 's important , ma 'am . I 'm sorry to , ah , disturb you , but ... Bring her . Bad news from Smithers ? Your Luxan has failed . My soldiers are hunting him down . He 'll be dead in an arn . Don 't fight me . Scorpy ... Scorpy brief you on this ? You wouldn 't do this . Not on your own . Not this far away from High Command . You 're just his whore , doing what he tells you to do . Is that enough dirt out of your hole , boss ? Get out of there . Congratulations , Peacekeeper whore . Perfect plan . One charge . You think Scorpius is the brain ? Go on . Kill the half-breed genius and ruin everything . There 's no charge in that weapon . Is he dead ? Yes . Yes , I think so . Shoot her . What ? I helped you ! I told you about the Luxan ! About his plan ! Shoot the tralk , Braca . Give me a gun and I 'll do it myself ! Skernac . Say skernac . It will save you . Braca , wait . Skernac . What did you say ? Skernac ! Do not let them bury me . Get her out of there . Get off me ! How do you know Special Directorate code ? Same way you do . And may I suggest , I would not bury the half-breed . I would leave him out in the sun to rot . It would scare the others more . I don 't think so . Bury him . Quickly ! Okay , Rygel , I 'm back on the planet . Have you managed to convince the Pilot ? Yes , we 'll wait for your signal . I 'd better get a Transport Pod ready . Yes . I 'll wait half an arn then initiate de-orbit . You 'll be able to target your fall onto the Marauders ? Off the Luxan 's signal . Farewell , Dominar . Perhaps if our species share the same afterlife , we will meet again . My interrogations are much more agreeable than Scorpius 's methods . Yeah . But I don 't know anything else . I 'm not scared . I 've told you everything . We don 't only have to talk about Scarrans . Squeeze the juice meat out of it . You 'll get a jolt . Wham ! And for 500 microts , nothing bothers you . Are you listening to me ? Oh , yeah . Always a pleasure . What the frell does she want ? Let me handle this . Thank you . Stay back , stay back . It 's all right . I always wait . You know , see both sides . Be reasonable But now , I have nothing to lose . Ah ! Frell ! Let ... her go . I did not betray you . I am bluffing for all I am worth just to get myself in here . Now . D 'Argo has a plan . You 're lying . We saw them not kill you . Why didn 't they ? They think I know some sort of secret survivor code . What did you say to them ? Skernac . What does it mean ? I have no idea . But it saved my life . And if you stop fighting me , I will try and save yours , too . Why don 't you put your fingers in her ears ? Stay still . Thank you . Captain Braca , I think I found something . Ah ! You found this tile here ? Yeah . And this face is Interion ? I think so . And this face from your home planet ? I think so . Do you know what this means ? Uh-huh . It means our two species may be very closely linked . Which does not surprise me at all . What 's the matter ? My back . It 's all scratched . I can hear your heart . What 's that ? That 's you . Rygel , tell the Pilot to commence countdown and start targeting the Marauders . Will do . Hurry . We don 't have much time , DRD . - Pilot , I 'm preparing the Transport Pod to leave . Are you ready ? What ? What ? Yes . I 've talked with Elack . We are prepared . The DRD is almost done fixing this , but we must start our descent in a thousand microts . Yes . Go . Must go . Goodbye , my friend . You 've served us well . Thank you , Dominar . Yes , must go . Must go now . Yeah . You like that . Mm-hmm . You like it like that . Pilot , what 's happening ? I said a thousand microts . No , no , no , don 't go yet . The Pod 's not fixed . I 'm still in the Transport Hangar . D 'Argo . Elack 's left early . He 's coming now . Chiana , the Leviathan 's on its way down now . How long have we got , D 'Argo ? I 'd say 400 microts . I 'll signal Crichton . What 's that ? Couldn 't do it the old fashioned way , could you ? Six-pack of beer . Night of bowling , skinny-dipping . Uh-uh . I hear you 've been putting some junk on the ball . Untie me . Little monkey , little Gaylord Perry , little Joe ... Neikro . No . You stay . You never heard my heart . Crichton ! Stay ! D 'Argo . I got your signal . Crichton . Hurry ! Where 's your ship ? I 'm on my way out of here . Whoops . Hello , Crichton . Hiya , Braca . Let me ask you a question . You 're a man of the world , right ? Does my ass look big in these pants ? D 'Argo ! Okay , I got a little problem here . Pilot ! Pilot ! Pilot , stop your dive ! Stop ! You 're too soon ! I can 't escape in the Pod yet ! John , Elack 's crashing down onto the Marauders now ! The magnetics are playing havoc with my system ! So , that was your plan ? Elack left early . Great plan . D 'Argo , I need a little help here ! Crichton , where are you ? I don 't know . Near Vella 's chamber , maybe . Just follow the pulse fire . - I know where that is . All right . Wrinkles , you go find D 'Argo 's ship . Hey ... hey , you ! You stay with us . Not that I don 't trust you , but I don 't . Come on . Damn ! Come on , you are the most powerful handgun in the Uncharted Territory . Now I don 't know if you fired 500 shots or 600 , but ... 600 . Empty . Damn you ! Winona would never do this because Winona is very reliable . Hey , Crichton . Hey , hey . Jool , can I borrow that pulse pistol ? Go on . Thank you . Hey . - Here . Hey , what was that ... what was that word you used to get out of the grave ? Skernac . Skernac ! Skernac ! Skernac ! Ah ! Well , it was worth a shot . This way . Come on ! Chiana , Elack 's almost on top of us . We have to lift off now ! We 're on our way , D 'Argo . Keep the engines hot . Braca ! Uh , it seems they do have a ship , ma 'am . A ship ? ! Pilot , stop ! D 'Argo , we 're dropping through the granasphere . I can 't stop Elack . Yes , ma 'am , it was off our scans . Captain , they must not escape ! - D 'Argo , we 're here . - Where are you ? D 'Argo ! Where 's the ship , fek-face ? Wait ! Wait ! What ? ! - What 's that sound ? We 're too late . It 's the Leviathan . - Back inside . - There 's no point in running . It is too close . There is always a point in running . Pilot . Pilot , wake up . Pilot ! Dominar , why are you still aboard ? Oh , you left early . We need more time . It may be too late . We must pull up . We must try . What happened ? Who cares ? Just go . Go , go ! Go ! Go , go , go ! You did it . Now , open the hangar doors . Come on ! Hurry ! Move ! Elack 's on his way back ! Ah ! - Jool ! Damn ! It 's out of oil ! I can 't believe it ! It 's out of oil ! Why are they all out of oil ? ! Come on ! Pilot , if you can , lock onto the Marauder 's coordinates again . Elack , if we don 't find the strength , it 's all been for nothing . We must try . Target the Marauders . We 're in . Let 's go . - Get us out of here . Elack ... now . Pilot . Are we clear ? Yeah , but we 've been hit pretty badly . The deception shroud 's been compromised . We 're gonna reappear in about a hundred microts . D 'Argo , I do apologize ... Jool , not now ! The magnetics are spiking , Braca . Ma 'am , two Marauders were destroyed but the third is still operational . We can make it back to the Command Carrier . And give Crichton two arns head start ? Tell the Carrier to retrieve us in flight . We 're going after them now . Lock onto their coordinates , Braca . The Darnaz Probes . They 're still here . Don 't forget them , Crichton . Don 't . They are not safe . Don 't be afraid . I know a way . Whoa , whoa . What are you talking about ? It 's a great plan . God , I love it . We leave the planet , then we come right back . We were not planning on coming back . Ah , I knew it was a lousy plan from the microt you told me . Should have left me in the Pod . Stop complaining ! At least I picked you up . There was nothing I could do . They hit the deception shroud and the turbines were about to fail . How come the Marauder went past us ? I fired a satellite probe . Hopefully they 'll follow that for about a day . Oh , great . Then come right back and kill us . That 's great . We 've got a day to live . No . Because by then , I would have fixed the turbines and we 'll be long gone . That is not gonna be possible . Look at your skin . This due to the magnetics ? Yeah . We stay here one more arn and we 're all gonna be dead . Can you get this thing fixed in an arn ? Get us out of here ? It 'll be difficult because they hit both power grids . When we first got here , Vella , she said something about the probes . If we what ... - Get all three probes , reactivate them at 600 motras apart , we can reverse the magnetics . Did you say motras or metras ? - Motras . So like , just over half a metra ? - That 's it . Then let 's go find the third probe . I was wrong . It was you , not Vella . You want the probes as a weapon . Where did Crichton see the probe ? I ... I don 't know . I don 't know exactly . He told me he saw it . He said it was buried . Well , Crichton was there . And he was there . And he was here . He was ... he was everywhere . Stop ! You tell me where it is , now ! I 'll ... I 'll never tell . Never . We 'll die here . We 'll all die . Granny . Gran ... We 're going probe hunting . Sorry to interrupt the party , Black Lagoon , but you have to go now . Get , get ! Go on . Get , get ! No , look , come back . Now , I know you hurt me , but I don 't wanna hurt you . I have ... I need ... Oh , that doesn 't sound too good . I 've looked for the Darnaz Triangle for 20 cycles . I will wait no longer ! You tell me where it is . Or you die ! The probe . Where is it ? Hey , I wanna find it as much as you do . It 's the only way we 're gonna get out of this situation , if we reverse what 's going on . We don 't need her for that . Where is it ? Actually , we do need her . If I can 't do it , she 's the only one who can ... can help . You won 't get a second chance without her . Probe is ... it 's that way . You . In front with the old woman . Over there . Behind those rocks . So you know where the other probes are . In the lair . That bitch Vella had them . Swore I 'd get my share of the bounty . But she lied . She tried to hide the other two probes . Bounty ? Now they 'll pay me . There . The third probe . It 's mine . Now I have no further use for you . No , Jool , don 't shoot him . He 's got the probe . Stop him ! What the hell is he doing ? ! He 's gonna get us all killed ! Crichton , we 're all gonna die . Oh ! But he can live down there , until the magnetic summer ends . And ? And ... Was that Winona ? Yes . I really don 't wanna know where you hid her . You help Crichton , I 'll get the other probes from Oo-nii 's lair . Go ! Ah ! Crichton . Crichton ! Come on . John ! I have both probes . Yeah , Jool , I got the third probe . How far did you say they had to be apart ? Six hundred motras . All right . Did you just save my life ? Again . Thanks . Hey , Pip , go with Jools . See if you can get those probes reactivated . Right . Hey , how do I do that ? Slam ' em on the ground and kick ' em . Kick ' em . Right . Crichton , I 've got the other probe . Good , Pip , just keep moving . Oh , this is far enough . Here goes nothing . Come on , work , damn you . Is yours working ? Nothing 's happening . You son of a bitch . Wait . Wait . It 's ... It 's working . You guys seeing this ? What was lost is now gained . Son of a gun . I can breathe again . I can . The probes . They must 've reversed the magnetics . John , it worked . John . John . I 'm okay . Me , too . Hey , you guys probably want to come check this out . What is that ? The lost Temple . The Darnaz Triangle . When it created the magnetic summers , it ... it must 've trapped part of the past . They 're the same priests that were here 12,000 cycles ago . Do they know time has passed ? I don 't think so . So you 're saying they 've been ... they 've been frozen like balla and now they 're awake ? They don 't know anything that 's happened ? I don 't think they know we 're here . So the question is do we stay or do we go ? I think that decision should rest with Jool . She 's the instructor here now . I 'm gonna say hello . Okay . Well , everything we found proves our races are linked . Maybe you should stay . Study what we discover . Wish I could . You know I can 't . That Aeryn ninx , right ? Yeah . You take care . I will . You , too . Is , uh ... is he the last ? Yeah . I 've said goodbye to everyone . I can 't make any of you stay . Well , uh , you 're the only who can stay . You 're the only one not being hunted by the Peacekeepers . The Priests will need help . They have 12,000 cycles of catching up . D 'Argo . I am so sorry for not defending you . Maybe you weren 't Vella 's intellectual equal , but ... But I am now . She 's a rock . I 'm trying to apologize . Go on . You ... you have more courage , integrity and honesty than a dozen Vellas . And I should 've said that to her . We retrieved their satellite probe . They must have shot it ahead as a lure . I will find them again and when I do , they will pay for this humiliation . But if I hear any gossip , a joke in the Officers ' Club , anything at all about what happened at Arnessk ... You won 't . - If I do ... you shall answer for it . Oh , come on . Look on the positive side . At least Jool won 't be hunted anymore . Unlike us . She can stay on Arnessk , have a goal , something to fight for . Unlike us . So any response from Moya ? Not yet . I 've sent out a secure Comm , but I 'm not even sure if this transmitter 's working properly . Great . We 're hunted by Peacekeepers , towing a dead module , lost in the Uncharted Territories with no purpose in life . How good does it get ? Oh , no . One of us has a purpose , don 't you , Crichton ? Hey , Grandma . Why 'd you try to kill me ? If Grayza asked , couldn 't have you giving her the Darnaz Probes . Better you dead than millions if she misused them . What 's your name , old woman ? Utu-Noranti-Pralatong . Well , Noranti , you 're right . I do have a purpose .

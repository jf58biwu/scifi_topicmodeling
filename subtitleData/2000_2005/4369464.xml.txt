 Now ! Are there any left alive ? I 've got to check the last hut . Check the perimeter . Don 't leave anything behind . The cart is loaded ! The raptors will feed well tonight . The men are ready father . Restless are they ? ... your weapons . Blood begets blood . The scouts say another village lies three days over the far hills . Then we 're off again , side by side . Come . On your command . Father , listen . Arms ! Very impressive . Which is more than I can say for this . Drakul - We were to meet at camp . - I was distracted . You were making enough noise and smoke ... to draw every tribe from miles around . For those who will not yield must be destroyed . I did not give you the secret of the powder for this . We have their treasure . Mere trinkets . These men and women ... would have been useful , slaves to rebuild the empire . Enough of your fantasy . You speak of politics ... while I speak of glory . The world will fear and respect us . And what good is a world of ashes ? I was a fool to align myself with a mere ape . We 'll discuss this later , back at camp . Why not dismount Tribune ? We 'll share some wine before we depart . Perhaps another time . I feel a certain chill in the air . - I 'll finish him . - No . We must make camp by nightfall . - But he lives ! - He leaves a blood trail . The jungle will swallow him . Let the lizard run . I still have the powder . At the dawn of the century A band of adventurers set out to prove the impossible The existence of a prehistoric world The Visionary The Heiress The Hunter The Scientist and The Reporter All chasing the story of a lifetime Stranded in a savage land Befriended by an untamed beauty Together they fight to survive In this amazing world of lost civilizations and terrifying creatures Always searching for a way home A way out of the Lost World We 're willing to risk out lives based on this , a few readings from a rusty old barometer ? Will you simmer down and let them speak their peace . As I was saying , Summerlee and I have been studying the weather patterns on the plateau . The strong updrafts that stranded us here seem to be abating . You actually think you can sail your way down off the plateau , - in the balloon ? - Well , we have to try . There 's only a window of a couple of days . And there may not be another one for a whole year . Need I remind everyone we were almost shredded to bits by those updrafts once before . We survived . We made it . Why tempt fate ? There 's got to be another way ? It 's been six months and we haven 't found it yet . Come on people ! Life 's a risk , especially here . What with ... dinosaurs , predators , ape-men - I say we give it a shot . - Good man . Bumpy ride is a small price to pay for a chance to see home again . That 's the way , Marguerite ? - First sign of danger . - And we turn back you have my word . Only to stop the rest of you from hogging all the glory . Well , looks like you 'll be leaving tomorrow then . What are you talking about , you 'll be coming too . Why ? This is my home . You don 't mean that do you ? No she doesn 't , Veronica . I can speak for myself Ned . I 'm staying . Good luck . I 'm sorry if we ganged up on you out there . I 'm fine , really . I always thought ... I 'm going to miss you Ned . I 'm going to miss all of you , very much . It 's all right to be afraid . Afraid ? What are you talking about ? London . It 's a different kind of jungle altogether . I see , so that 's what you think this is all about ? We 'll talk about this in the morning . I 'm not going . But I can 't stay here with you . I hate to break it to you Ned , but no one asked you to . Be careful with those samples now . Really George , one Pterodactyl egg would prove the point but a dozen , grandstanding . Professional jealousy rears its ugly head already . Found him . I thought she at least would have come to see us off ... We said our goodbyes back at the treehouse . Don 't worry Ned , we 'll send a rescue party back . Sure , I 'll cast off . Not without me . Thank you . You better hop in Malone ; I 'll cast the next one loose . I 'll get it . What the hell are you doing ? Stop fooling around and get into the balloon right away . Sorry Professor I 'll have to catch the next one . You 're sure you know what you 're doing ? I 'm about to find out . Heads up then , your rifle . - Thanks . - The lads insane . - The lads in love . - There 's a difference ? - Malone . - Surprise . I 've could have killed you . - Where is everyone else ? - Gone . - You didn 't . - I did . - I can take care of myself . - I know . Eleven years Malone , before you and your friends came along , I was doing just fine . I just couldn 't leave you . I 'd thought you 'd be happy . It couldn 't be . Tribune . Ned ! - Any last words ? - Help me . Without Malone 's extra weight we are making excellent progress . I still can 't believe he could do such a stupid thing . What 's the matter Marguerite ? No man ever given up his wealth for you before ? Just wait ' til we 're back on my turf . Hum , do you two really want to spend your last minutes on the Lost World bickering ? Just think of the wonderful scenery your missing . And the amazing dinosaurs . Oh yes and those roving hordes of armed marauders . I 'll miss them too . - Look ! - What is it ? There are people inside . - But it flies . - We 've been spotted . What can they do to us up here ? Crossbows , Balloon . Bring it down . Help me with the bags . Damn that was a little too close . There 's just too many of them . What the hell do you thing you 're doing ? We need more altitude . That should do it . Save your fire , we 're out of range . Our friends seem to have given up . Yes they 've dropped their crossbows . So why isn 't Roxton smiling ? Because I don 't like the look of that . Release ! - Oh - My God . - What the hell was that ? - Smooth sailing my ass . We 're dropping fast . Hold on everyone . any survivors I want them alive . - It 's about time . - Just saving the best for last . - Everybody all right ? - A few rattled nerves maybe . But no broken bones hmmm ? So much for the good news . It looks like somebody just closed our window of opportunity . Good Lord , it couldn 't be . - Gunpowder . - Hey boys over here . There 's a village through there . Maybe somebody can sew . - Is he dead ? - I don 't think so . Do you think he 's breathing . - I don 't hear anything . - Ah - Small world . - Too small . Your attitude is regrettable , though I suppose somewhat understandable . Understand this , one false move and your dead . Gunpowder ? Amazing how a few small grains of black powder should bring us all together again . All dead , how horrible . Poor bastards , from the looks of this place they put up quite a fight . Everything 's picked clean . There are no weapons . Look familiar ? - Summerlee here . - I think I recognize the handy work . More Gunpowder ? Those raiders were native Challenger . No tribe on this plateau has gunpowder . You gave them what ? Only Drakul knows how to make it . But you said yourself he 's a madman . A madman can be an asset . A certain lack of conscience I find appealing . So what 's your problem ? No style , no vision . I engaged these mercenaries in order to regain my empire . And instead Drakul is blowing up every village in his path . You 're sure you 're not angry because he beat you to it ? Such small brains , it 's amazing you 're not extinct already . I come from a noble race , a race which conquers not to destroy but in order to flourish . What 's the point of ruling if there 's nothing remaining but ashes ? Life 's tough , you 're breaking my heart . Look Tribune we cleaned your wound and we 'll give you some water . But you 're walking , now . I warn you , if Drakul is permitted to pillage at will . Every village , outpost and settlement will be destroyed , including this rather tasteless hodgepodge of timber and thatch . Enough ! Move it ! Ah well , it is your fault . I suppose it 's only fitting that you should perish too . What do you mean our fault ? Gunpowder , you let the genie out of the bottle . Remember ? Only because you held our friends hostage . Perhaps I misjudged you . Perhaps being responsible for the slaughter of innocents won 't keep you awake at night . To have come so close and to fail . One thing 's for sure . It could have been a lot worse . Don 't speak too soon . Take cover . * Cover me Not to put any pressure on you but I 'm out of bullets . What can I say madam , you inspire me . Your lucky day Is everyone all right ? Won 't be long before the rest of them arrive . - Time to move . - Easier said than done . No harm done . Looks like I 'll have to sweep you off your feet . Let 's go . Well as seeing the alternative is imminent death . You 've got a date . That leg , it 's really bleeding very badly . I 'm sorry , I 'm slowing us down . I 'm going to have to dress that wound . So far so good , we can spare a minute . What we need is a defensible position . I 'll scout up ahead . Nobody goes alone Challenger , I 'm coming with you . An extra rifle . It 's fully loaded . Well Lord Roxton someone would think you cared . I do . Come on sit down . Easy , easy , easy , easy , easy . How bad ? I saw some yarrow a little way back along the path . It 'll help stop the bleeding . Can you manage a few more yards ? Yeah don 't worry about me . I won 't be alone . I 'll be right back . - Defeat . - And no one defeats us . You 're dying . It 's an honor to serve Drakul . I await your command on the other side . Swift journey . Let me go after them . - Who do you honor ? - Myself . - Who do you honor ? - My father . - Who do you honor ? - My tribe . Then go , take three men with you . Alive , I want the secret of the flying thing . I won 't fail . If you do , I 'll kill you myself . A few hours ago he was dying . Now he 's out running both of us . Tired already , should I carry you both ? - No thanks . - You seem healed already . Superior metabolism . Like the rest of my species . - Get down ! - We 'll handle this ! Sometimes the old ways are the best . Marguerite ? You are my prisoners . Surrender to the will of Drakul . - What have you done with ... - Not my day . There are two more of them . Drakul will be pleased . To camp . We will search for the others . This will do Challenger . We can make camp ; spend the night if we have to . You get a clear view of the whole valley from here . Give me your spyglass . What is it ? Looks like we 've got company already . Damn , - Marguerite 's rifle ! - Let me see . Oh my God you 're right . I was a fool to leave them alone . We don 't know that they 're dead Roxton . Then where the hell are they ? Killing them we 'll never find out . What do you suggest ? Invite them over for tea and pleasant conversation ? Yeah , yeah something like that . Where are they ? Let 's try that again . Where ... are ... they ? - Gone . - Are they alive ? I got all the time in the world . Which is more then I can say for you . Yes . Where are they ? At our camp , prisoner 's of Drakul . Who ? Our leader , my father . - How many men in your camp ? - Not many four or five . That means we can count on at least fifty . You ! You 're free to go . Are you mad ? Tell Drakul that if he doesn 't release our friends , he won 't see his son alive . Go ! I thought you said only a few hours walk ? For me yes , I neglected to take into account your inferior skeletal structure . There is no raider 's camp is there ? This is all just a big game . I don 't play games . Drakul 's camp is on the other side . Fine , after you . Not afraid of heights are you ? Gaze upon thy feeble enemy . Oh my God . They don 't look so feeble to me . Three of us against a small army . Well all we have to do is destroy their gunpowder and kill their leader , simple really . Look ! Right there below us . The balloon ! Summerlee and Marguerite ! No sign of Roxton and Challenger . You are hurting me ! You son of a bitch . This whole thing was a set up . Believe me this is as much a surprise as to me as it is to you . Although I will say one thing , the female human is as charming as ever . Aren 't you an ugly toad . Actually I take it back you 're not a toad you 're a wart on a toad . The more you scream the sooner you die . What the hell do you want from us ? Make it fly . Somebody 's spiked your punch . It 's a basket it can 't fly . Then you 're already dead . We have to save them . What are two lives compared to the destruction of entire civilizations . Listen to me you slimy bastard . We both know this isn 't about saving any civilization . This is about revenge . You do know ... that with the flick of my wrist I could snap your spine in two . Those are our friends down there . Drakul and the gunpowder have to wait . Well , if we 're going to infiltrate their camp . Some sort of distraction might be in order . It might . Say just off the top of my head you understand , a large explosion . You mean like a big stash of gunpowder . Ah Brilliant ! Do you promise to help with the rescue ? You have me at a disadvantage . Very well ... we explode the gunpowder and then we rescue the subordinate species . And then I kill Drakul . Nothing like a lizard with a one track mind . Ned , I 'm glad you stayed . Have you taken complete leave of your senses woman . A simple thank you for saving my life would suffice . We already know they have gunpowder , how could you tell Drakul about the Hydrogen gas ? Easy , it was either that or die . So you simply hand over the balloon . Thanks to you they 'll be dropping bombs all over the plateau . Look I bought us some time didn 't I ? Exchange ! How dare you ! He is your son ! Thane has disgraced the tribe as have you . - Who do you honor ? - Myself . - Who do you honor ? - My leader - Who do you honor ? - My tribe . Swift journey . Come on your hands are tied not your feet . Pick up the pace . But why not the both of us ? Because if I don 't make it you 're the only hope for Summerlee and Marguerite . You think they 're planning an ambush . It crossed my mind . All the more reason why I should be there at the exchange , to cover your back . This is non-negotiable Challenger . - Protest all you want . - Let me put it bluntly . Lord John Roxton dies the world loses a hunter , Professor George Challenger dies and the world loses a visionary . My friend the choice has already been made for us . Oh great , the little bugger took my knife . - Oh no , you don 't . - Let me go . What , so you can kill yourself ? - I 'm dead already . - Nobody 's going to hurt you son . I 've been captured . I 've disgraced my tribe . All right look , from one man of honor to another , when we make the exchange you will be free to go . You have our word on it . I 'm prepared to die with honor and when I do Drakul will revenge my death . Come on kid , you 're not dead yet . The gunpowder is kept in there . You forgot to mention it was guarded . Ah - an annoyance nothing more , but they must be silenced before they can give the alarm . Well the camps within ear shot , we don 't want to start a riot . At least not yet . Fortunately I have a strategy . Hey ! Scrawny , but you do have your appeal . Come and get it . Halt Oh no . Perfect timing . Where 's Tribune ? The third guard ? Delicious . This is it ? You 've got to be kidding ? Patience my child is its own reward . One man with all this gunpowder ... Could rule the world . Rope Bridge , this is where we 're supposed to meet . I don 't like it , too many places to hide . Then you 'll just have to do a good job of covering me . Well don 't worry about that . Where the hell is our reception committee ? Challenger Be careful it could be a trap . What the hell is going on here ? My father doesn 't bargain . Your friends are as good as dead . Now just hang on a second . The destruction of Drakul 's supplies is merely a prelude to his own annihilation Our people come first . That was the deal . And this close to the camp how can we be sure the blast will buy us enough time ? Do you have a better idea . Maybe What are you doing ? Keeping you out of trouble . You are fools no man defeats Drakul . Yea , we 're always up for a challenge . Now which way is your camp ? My capture has already dishonored my tribe . I will not betray them again . Watch out ! Hey ! What the hell ? Out of the way ! What is it ? What 's in it ? Well my guess is that way Let me go untie me . You 're our only insurance my friend . I want you safe . I will pray for your excruciating death . Water ! Move ! How do we tell which tent has Summerlee and Marguerite in it ? There ! The whole camps on fire and he 's still standing guard ? What the hell 's going on out there ? I don 't know it just sounds like one hell of a party . Call it a surprise party . Veronica ! Malone ! Get down . There 's the perimeter of the camp . If we can make it across this open stretch we 're home free . Stay low now and run . These guards are like cockroaches . Hunt ! Kill ! There - Everyone all right ? - Oh just peachy . Through there quickly , quickly . Come on Come on we 're almost there . Time to go . Hurry up get across the bridge ! We 'll cover you . Come on , come on ! Stay down Summerlee . Stay down . What are you stopping for ? Keep moving - keep moving ! Persistent little buggers . Summerlee ! Arthur ! Summerlee ! No ! No ! Summerlee ! NO ! Hurry Challenger ! Challenger he 's gone - let 's go ! That 's for Summerlee and so is this . - Ned - Ned ! - Ned just hold still . I 'm just not gonna sit here and watch ; I 've got to do something . No ! Look at that thing it can 't hold us all . Malone ! Ned - Ned - No ! Nooooooo Perfect Father ! I 've got you , - grab on to something . - Like what ? Anything . We 've got to pull them up . I can 't reach . We can 't they 're too far down . Then we 'll pull up the whole damn bridge . Save your own life Roxton . I once promised to follow you to hell and back Challenger don 't make me a liar . NO ! NO ! Their gone ; they 're really gone . We 're gonna keep searching just further down . But even if they survived the fall , the current , the rocks . You ! Stay right where you are . I 'm unarmed . Fine with me . I tried to stop Tribune but I failed . - Where is he now ? - Gone ... with the gunpowder but what does it matter ? your friends are dead , my father 's dead . What do you want from us sympathy ? No . Then why are you here ? Same reason you are , to bring home the bodies .

 There 's no rush . Browse all you like . Do you like that ? I don 't care much for room decorations . I uh - I prefer to decorate my self . Oh , like this for instance . Synthetic Camon stone . Worthless . Synthetic ? If you like it , what difference does it make ? If it 's not worth anything , I don 't like it . Oh ! So young , and yet so mercenary ! That portrait is one of me own works . Resembles you , don 't you think ? Not really . Ah ! Look at this . Mm . Hynerian royal tiara from the Neltoth era . Authentic Neltoth ? Nonsense . It 's a cheap copy . And I should know , I gave them to all my wives ! If you don 't want it , but it back Rygel and we can all get out of here . What 's your rush ? Is there anything remotely exciting happening back on Moya ? Minding you two on a shopping expedition is even less exciting . Nobody asked you to come ! You should have that tiara . As a keepsake of your home world . A fake keepsake ? I 'll give you a single food cube for it . Oh ! And that 's generous ! Done . We 're low on food cubes and you gave one away for that ? It 's a good enough copy to fool the next trader we run across . Fine ! Can we go ? Yes . Now that I 'm finished . Wonderful ! Chiana , are you done ? Guess so . Don 't go empty handed . want to give you this . Now , that 's a better image , don 't you think ? You just work on that ? I didn 't see you do it . Hey . Th - - that 's my favorite necklace ! I lost that half a cycle ago ! Now you can enjoy that once more . What , you 're ... you 're just giving it to me ? Well , you haven 't been given uch in your life , have you ? Hm ? Take it Perhaps it will help you . Get a better understanding of the true value of art . Which is what ? Well , in this case , it 's a window in time . This defense screen is pretty much fried , I 'm not even sure if it 's worth fixing . There 's no harm in trying . You were saying ? Just watch what you 're doing . Pilot I thought the juice was supposed to be turned off , down here . It is , but Moya has been experiencing number of minor power anomalies . I 'm trying to isolate them Then keep trying , and get us some more DRD 's ! I have no more to spare . What about the ones working on Aeryn 's Prowler ? Aren 't they just doing routine maintenance ? Scheduled maintenance , which is overdue . She would not be pleased to post - pone it further . Give us four of 'em . Aeryn doesn 't have to know . She 's just returned Is that mine ? I 've been looking for that forever . Where 'd you find it ? And how did she know you 'd - you 'd find it ? My name is John Crichton ... an astronaut ... radiation wave hit me ... I got shot through a wormhole ... lost in some distant part of the universe ... on a ship a living ship full of strange alien life - forms ... help ... Listen please ... Is anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm Being hunted by an insane military commander ... Doing everything I can ... I 'm just looking for a way home . Well first , it didn 't even look like me at all . Then it showed me with a necklace , nd then it showed me with a broken leg . Okay ? You know what I think ? I - I think it can predict the future ! My Aunt Ruth can do that , xcept she uses tea leaves . Oh , okay . Then how do you explain this ? And this ? Have you eaten , drunk , smoked , sniffed anything weird lately ? No . Have you ? Not lately . Look , ask Aeryn and Rygel . They - they saw it when it showed me the necklace . They saw it change , too ? No , but that doesn 't mean ... Could Aeryn and Rygel have switched it for another , r tampered with it , somehow ? So you think maybe one of 'em 's messin ' with Chi ? I 'm only exploring possibilities . Nah , Aeryn 's not exactly the joking type and Rygel , I can - I can see him pullin' her leg , ut not exactly breaking it . You said you tripped over a DRD that found your necklace ? Yeah Pilot , is there anything weird goin ' on with the DRD 's ? No All DRDs are functioning normally and performing as I ordered . Pilot , did you assign a DRD to look for Chiana 's lost necklace ? Yes . Some time ago , at her request . Well , there we have it . Coincidence , bad luck , aybe a bit of power of suggestion thrown in Yeah , yeah , yeah ... xcept it did change . Well , I don 't know what to tell ya . I 'd like to run some tests on that portrait , if you don 't mind . Yeah , I do mind ! What if you screw it up somehow ? I 'm not going to harm it ! I 'm not ! Sorry , it 's stayin ' here . What if - I mean , wanna see - I wanna see what it 's gonna show me next . Zhaan how about if you take , take a tiny little chip off someplace where it doesn 't show ? That work for you ? Better than nothing . But it 's mine ! I - I don 't see why I should let her ... Pip ! She just fixed your damn leg . A very . Little . Piece . Definitely it ! never forget an aroma . What ? Genuine ! Not possible ! No ... I 'm surprised you 're using my possessions ithout my consent , Rygel . Especially after what I did to you the last time . Let go ! I 'll replace what I 've used ! I 'll buy you an entire vat of Elboth Oil . This tiara , is authentic ! I thought you said it was a copy . Well , it 's not ! And that fool Kyvan sold it for a single food cube ! Ha ! Silly old woman had no idea what she had ! Pilot , reverse course ! Find that trader woman 's ship . Ignore him , Pilot . Moya has better things to do han to search for Kyvan 's vessel . Agreed What the yotz are you talking about ? We have a chance to turn a tidy profit , here ! Have you any idea what this is worth ? We are not returning ... o that ship , Rygel . Now , get out ! I 'll take this up with the others . Please do . Isn 't it something ? Wonder what it 'll show me next . Suppose it 's not just predicting events , ut actually causing them . It brought me back my necklace , and then it turned around and broke my leg . Why would it do that ? I don 't know . Then why not just believe it 's what the old woman says it is ? A window into time . Assuming all of that is true , o you really want to know what the future holds ? Well , of course I do . Come on , D 'argo. on 't you wanna know if you 're ever gonna find your son ? No If it 's bad news , then uh , don 't want to lose all hope . Or it might keep you from - from spending your whole life earching for something that 's never gonna happen . If I don 't try , it will definitely never happen . Now ... I want you to get rid of that . I think you 're just being superstitious Luxan I am being a concerned Luxan . Oh . Aren 't you sweet . Do you really care about what happens to me ? Shouldn 't I ? Of course you should I 'm glad you do . I wonder if the portrait ill show both of us , next ? Give us a glimpse of our future . I 'm not sure I wanna know about that , either . Why ? Cause of what it might not show ? Or what it might ? Listen to me . I do care about you . That 's why I want you to start being sensible nd get rid of that . Oh , okay , so I 'm not being sensible now ? Well , I 'm so sorry to disappoint you , but I 'm keeping it . I need to rest now . Alone . Even if the object did change , t 's still just a trick . I 've seen con - artists on many planets ull off bigger frauds than that Yeah , well , she got it for free , o it 's not much of a score , if it 's a con . Chiana insulted Kyvan 's artwork. aybe Kyvan wanted revenge or something . So , what , you think that she rigged the painting o that Chiana would be spooked into breaking her leg ? hat 's a bit of a stretch . What 's your theory ? hat it can predict the future ? No , I don 't have a theory , just a hypothesis . We should have steered clear of Kyvan 's ship And as usual , we have Rygel nd Chiana to thank for that . There isn 't a single flying junk dealer in the Uncharted Territories , hat they 'd pass up . Well , you know what I say . ? I say we lock all of Moya 's doors . We don 't let anybody in , we don 't let anybody out . That way we get no alien critters , no shape - shifting bugs , no mind altering viruses , no freaky - deaky artifacts . If I had my way , I 'd throw Rygel off the ship . Chiana too , maybe . Huh ? Well , Rygel I can sort of understand , but Chiana ? She gets us into nearly as much trouble as Rygel does . Yeah . Butshe means well . Sometimes . That 's not the point ! Then what is the point ? You know , even Rygel has his moments once in awhile . Once in a great while. n balance , we 'd probably be better off without him . Oh yeah ? Well , what about Zhaan ? You wanna throw her off the ship ? Possibly D 'argo ? Me ? Pilot . Let 's get rid of Pilot . That 'd be good. hen you could have the whole ship to yourself . Mm . Is that an offer ? Well , let 's start with this room , see how it goes . Zhaan Whoa ! Hey . Sorry , I didn 't .. mean to startle you Is everything okay ? No , it isn 't . No Well , you wanna tell me ? How can I tell you what I don 't know ? Every test I try finds nothing unusual n - in the material of Chiana 's portrait . So , if that junk dealers fakin' us out with a magic trick , you can 't figure out how ? Look , don 't worry about it , okay ? You know , painting probably never changed . Chiana was hallucinating . It 's all in her mind . No , John B - believe me . This is not in Chiana 's mind . She 's in danger . From what ? Zhaan Tell me . I can 't tell you yet . All I have are suspicions . But if I 'm right John , soon there may come a time when I need you and everyone to do exactly as I say . Quickly ... and without question Do you have enough faith in me to obey ? Okay , Zhaan . Whatever you 're doing , taking a flier , laying a hunch , I 'm in . Can 't speak for the others , ut when the time comes for you to make your move , I 'll back you up Thank you , John . I want you to bring me Chiana 's portrait . Yeah , it 'll look nice in here . I don 't want to look at it . I want to destroy it . One portrait , comin ' up Crichton , I 've decided we must take that painting away from Chiana . It 's no good for her . Zhaan 's way ahead of you , there . hatever it is , it 's got her good and freaked What happend ? It changed ! When did it change ? Just now ! I - I looked away for no more than a microt . Where are you goin ' ? I 'm getting out of here , et go ! Help me . Please take me somewhere safe . I will , I will. ou deal with that ! Yeah , no problem. ut Zhaan wants to do the honors . What is going on ? heard screaming . I 'm gonna die here , he portrait told me . Told you what ? It changed again. his time it shows her on fire . This is a load of dren ! It 's real ! ' m burnin ' up ! Chiana , you 're fine , ou don 't even feel hot ! I 'm burnin up ! Zhaan , it happened again ! Chiana said it happened in the blink of an eye . Where is she ? She 's in the cargo bay with D 'argo and Aeryn . Go , I 'll see what I can do here . Right Put me in there ! I 'm going ! What , i - in the freezer , Chiana ? Chiana , Listen to me , it 's all in your head ! Leave her alone ! Are you completely out of your mind ? f she doesn 't freeze to death in there , she will suffocate ! Pilot , how long can Chiana last in there ? Indefinitely If I raise the temperature and maintain air flow . Do it ! Don 't tell me you 're going along with this nonsense , too ? I don 't see any danger in playing it safe ! If you cater to her fears , ou 'll make them worse ! John What the hell ? Pilot , what 's goin ' on in there ? I don 't know . Nothing should be combustible . Pilot , this door is jammed . Open it ! The door controls aren 't responding ! Stand back . ! Stand back . ! Chiana ! The door lock 's responding now Ithink I can open it . Crichton is Chiana ? She 's gone , Pilot . It 's true then ? Chiana 's dead . It 's true , Rygel . She died , that way ? Yes Then why couldn 't you save her ? You had warning ! You could have done something ! At least we tried ! Which is more than I can say for you ! Where were you when she died ? Sleeping ? Eating ? If anyone had seen fit to inform me , would have ... Get out ! I should have gone down to the ship with them . I should have stopped her from bringing it back . No , I should have taken it away from her earlier There are a number of things we all should have done . And we can do one of them now . Zhaan , how do we dispose of this piece of junk ? Fire would be a fitting end ! There was no reason for it . There has to be . Wh - what about a defective power doubler in the freezer ? All it 's components check out fine . Al - alright , well you said that Moya had some uh , energy surges and other anomalies that you couldn 't isolate maybe this is related to it . There was nothing wrong with the freezer . Why couldn 't you get the door open in time , then ? Chiana must have jammed it when she closed it . Alright could she have damaged the conduit when she pulled it shut ? I 've told you , no malfunction of Moya 's , caused that fire Nor was it an error of control on my part . Alright , I 'm - I 'm not blaming you Pilot , ut something had to cause it ! Knock it off . It 's not your fault . Who said it was ? Well , you 're grillin ' Pilot looking for a reason , you 're not the reason . I know I 'm not , why would I be ? You wanted her off the ship . I never said I wanted her dead , Crichton . Fine No Are you always gonna do this ? Do what ? Keep the entire world at a distance ! eep everybody away ! Is that ever gonna change ? Crichton . Yes , D 'argo . Come to the center chamber , e have a problem . Pilot ? No idea . What 's the problem ? This is Another one ? It can 't be the same one , e burned it up ! Kahaylin help us ! Looks like you , D 'argo Yes it does . It appears unfinished . Still in flux . I vote we don 't wait around for it to develop . I agree ! It repaired itself once , t may do so again . Then it shall do so in space . Pilot , where 's the nearest access shaft ? I want to get this thing as far away from Moya as I can . Tier three . Hammond side . Zhaan , you cool with that ? Yes , get rid of it . I 'm going to go and ind the trader and get some answers Pilot , is my Prowler ready ? No , it 's still undergoing maintenance . Take my module . Bucket of dren . Go for it , Pilot ! Expelling now . I am tracking the fragments . We are moving away from them at hetch six velocity . Works for me . I don 't know art , but I know what I don 't like . Are you certain it 's gone ? Far behind us , and off the radar . Once Aeryn returns , e should do a Starburst or two , to make sure . Yup , the more distance between us and that thing , the better . What 's the matter ? I thought I heard something Zhaan ? Oh , oh ! Ah ! Don 't shoot , it 's me ! Reason enough to pull the trigger. hat are you doing here ? Don 't you think that I have a score to settle with this Kyvan ? ust as you do ? Score to settle , or a profit to make ? Can 't I accomplish both at once ? Chiana was given a dangerous product Kyvan therefore owes us restitution . Chiana 's dead and all you 're concerned bout is getting compensation . Punitive damages . She was quite a lot like me , you know . Ella se parecía bastante a mí , lo sabes She had spirit , ambition , hah , large appetites ! She would have made an excellent Hynerian . I 'mactually going to miss her . One way or another , yvan will make restitution . D 'argo ? By the Goddess , no ! What do we have to do to ditch this thing ? rop it in a black hole ? John , We 've lost If this is my fate , will accept it . No , we 're not accepting anything ! e fight this . We can 't keep fighting ! Zhaan It 's stronger than all of us ! ¡ Zhaan ! Alright kids , time to think . First off , what the hell is that supposed to be ? It signifies a Qualta blade . Zhaan , take this and lock it away in the farthest tier you can find . Next , we get you into a big open space . As far away from any pointy objects as possible John , You 've been a good friend . Whatever happens , t 's been a pleasure to know you D 'Argo Shut up ! Have you never heard of a self - fulfilling prophecy ? No ! Anybody ? Please ? Chiana ? D 'argo ? D 'argo ! You 're alive . I am ? Where are we ? I think ... I think we 're in the portrait . It punched ... right through him , and then he disappeared No blood , no guts , no nothin ' . Where 'd he go ? We gotta get him back ! e - look , he could not just vanish , Zhaan ! John He may not even be dead ! ither way , we gotta know ! What ? Great . I 'm next . Batter up This is great , Zhaan . This thing is picking us off like flies , nd nobody even knows what it is . Zhaan , I 'm ready . Just gimme your plan . Please ? Come on . Zhaan . This magical mystery crap is your specialty , ot mine , you just tell me what to do , nd I 'll do it ! There is nothing I can tell you . Ah , welcome back ! Now what can I interest you in , this time ? Only interested in one thing , nd that 's the thing you gave Chiana . Oh , well I hope she 's enjoying ' that portrait ... . Don 't frell around with me , ou know exactly what happened , don 't you ? It 's a very bad idea to annoy her , when she 's in this sort of mood See what I mean ? If I were you , I 'd tell her everything . But , I - I don 't know anything ! Well , that 's unfortunate for you , isn 't it ? Because if you had something to tell me , ' d have a reason not to shoot you , but since you 're not telling me anything ... . I - I had no choice ! I - I - I was - I was forced to create that portrait ! By whom ? W - well he made me do it ! Who ? I didn 't want to ! .. Who ? He trick - ted me ! Who ? Maldis Maldis That 's what she said . It can 't be Maldis , e destroyed 'im . We only dispersed him . I knew he 'd coalesce again someday . I never dreamt it would be this soon . Okay Zhaan , so what do we do ? Zhaan , What do we ... Are you hearing me ? Zhaan ! Crichton , what 's the matter ? Zhaan just bugged out on us . raying or catatonic , I don 't know I 'll leave straight away . No - no . Don 't do that . Stay there. e need all the information we can get . Right . So ... Start talking . Nothing that I can tell ou will do any good . Maldis is too powerful . Start talking . Zhaan Stop bugging out ! If we beat Maldis before , e can do it again ! Don 't go chicken on me , here ! John , I speak to you via the bond of Unity we shared . Now is the time to trust me . I have a plan . You must focus Maldis ' attention on you , for as long as possible . Ignore what I say next . Maldis cannot be defeated ! He 's already taken Chiana ! And D 'argo ! He 's going to take you next . Then the rest of us ! One by one ! Zhaan , we can beat 'im . No , we can 't All we can do is surrender . Shorten our pain . Well , I 'm not giving up . I am . Whoa . That first step . John ! D 'Argo ! No , wait , don 't come through ! What the hell ? D 'Argo ? Where the hell did you go ? I haven 't moved. t 's these archways . They lead . elsewhere . You seen Chiana ? Yes , but I couldn 't get to her. tried other archways but I lost her entirely . Great . It 's not just a painting , t 's a maze . Terrific . And I know who built it . Maldis ! Come on down ! Maldis ? None other than. oesn 't that just make your day ? Maaaldiiiiis ! Maldis ! Come on you old bastard , how me your ugly face ! Haven 't you read the super villain 's handbook ? This is where you 're supposed to twirl your mustache and gloat . I don 't have a mustache , John . How you doin ' old man ? You 're lookin ' kinda pale , ou getting enough sun ? Irreverent as ever . I missed that . Yeah , it 's been awhile , huh ? Tell me , what you been doing all this time ? putting yourself back together ? And what 's it like being dispersed ? Less than pleasant I sustained myself by concentrating ... . on revenge Well here I am , dude . Revenge away . Please ! You 're not even a player I 'm saving my revenge for one who deserves it ... . Pa - U Zhaan . I 'm crushed . And here I was thinking e both kicked your ass , last time . No , she kicked my ass . And saved yours As you say , this magical mystery crap 's not your thing Why do you think that I took you nd your two friends , first ? Because you were lonely . Because I wanted Zhaan o see her shipmates die . Have you forgotten ? Fear makes me stronger . Fear and the terror of helplessness . These are a few of my favorite things . Oh , could you do that " Farewell , Goodbye " song the kids sing ? It 's one of my favorites I don 't do requests ! You 're convinced that Zhaan will pull some Delvian fast one , and save the day . Johnny - O , Your mind to me is an open book Full of big print and lots of pictures ! Then read this . Kiss I 'm betting on her . Not you . Bad bet . Do you understand , Pilot ? Frankly , no . But I will do exactly as you 've asked . I wish you luck For all our sakes Zhaan , What is it ? It 's Maldis , can 't you hear him ? I don 't hear anything . Johnny , last bought , she had some help . Cost the poor fellow his life , didn 't it ? This time she 's alone . You might not be afraid , but she is . And that 's why I 'll destroy her Excuse me , hile I remind her how much I care . Pa 'u Zhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan ! Zhaan ! So much for that plan ! Anymore bets ? I failed . Too weak . Zhaan , Don 't give up You never give up What a wreck ! She begged me to put her out of her misery . Unfortunately , want to enjoy her misery a little longer . But there 's no reason hy she should suffer on her own . D 'Argo ? Where are you ? Chiana You 're here ? Oh , frell Who 's the ugly old man ? His name is Maldis. e 's your basic evil vampire . He sucks the life force out of people . He just plain sucks. isten up everybody , this joker feeds on fear . So we 're gonna stay calm . Zhaan 's not listening to you , John . Zhaan , we keep our cool , we starve him out . Bravado to the end , have to admire that . Even though deep down , f course you are quaking in your boots . Dream on . Stop ! You want fear ? I 'll give you some ! Picture if you will , me standing on your home planet Six billion creatures like you , eavy breeders . , Your species would kept me well fed for a long time You stay the hell away from Earth . You see ? Everyone has a panic button just waiting to be pushed ! Even the Luxan ! Your son , Jothee How old is he ? I can 't wait to run across him . Didn 't you tell him John , hat that sort of thing doesn 't work ? And the runaway Nebari How would you like a free trip home o your planet ? You wouldn 't ? Oh ho , scared that you 'd be mentally leansed by your countrymen ? Well , don 't worry . Because none of you will leave this place ! You don 't scare me ! You 're all mouth . Bigger the talk , smaller the action ! Little girl , I 'll show you action ! And this is it ! I leave , you don 't . This realm dissolves , nd you with it . Except of course , for your essence . Your life force , your spirit . Whatever you like to call it . I call it lunch . Time for choir practice , Priest . Maldis , Please ! I beg you ! Oh , you beg me ? I like that . Maldis ! No ! D 'argo don 't. ou 'll just make it worse . When all the atoms in your body are ripped apart and I consume what 's left then you 'll know what pain is . And all this ... will happen , n one hundred microts from now If you like a count down . Officer Sun . Priority message from Zhaan . What is it , Pilot ? Kill Kyvan , and get out of there fast Acknowledged . Out ! Now ! How did you know all that would happen . I didn 't . And you shot Kyvan anyway ? Crichton said I should follow haan 's instructions without question . Did he ? Well he didn 't bother to tell me ! Of course not. hen have you ever followed instructions ? Was that your doing ? Well , it won 't help you ! Because I 'm much stronger than you think ! So am I ! Go ! Hurry ! Hurry ! Chiana ! Get up ! Leave me . Come on ! Leave me here ! Get up ! No ! leave me here ! No Home sweet home . Fire one ! Great Fire two ! That was your plan ? Yes . Like it ? Well , what 's not to like ? Explain this to me , froggy . Crichton comes back , he 's not really electrocuted Okay , D 'argo comes back , not a scratch on 'im . I came back nothing burnt , but I still got a busted leg . Why is that ? Why ask me ? I 'm still trying o figure out the whole Maldis and Kyvan thing Oh , no - no - no look , Zhaan laid that bit out for me . Okay , when Maldis recaporialised Re - what ? Well , put himself back together , e couldn 't yet break through to our physical plane so he had to manipulate matter o form Kyvan and her ship and create the painting hich would not only bridge both realms , but also allow , well , plant our fears , hich would allow him to capture us , and grow even stronger Clear ? Then , when Aeryn blasted Kyvan , hich was just actually a temporary extention of Maldis , it weakened Maldis enough or Zhaan to make her move , simple . But why ? I mean , how did Zhaan Oh ... .Best not ponder questions like these. hey 'll only make your head hurt . Forget about it . Sit back and enjoy the happy ending . What happy ending ? My priceless Hynerian tiara is gone ! Vanished , just like Kyvan and her ship . Oh , well we can 't have everything , Ryg . I can 't have anything . So what do you think , Zhaan ? Is that son ' bitch gone for good this time ? With a being like Maldis , we can never be entirely certain . Zhaan , This would have been a really good opportunity o lie to me . You know ? You know ? " Sure John he 's toast. trike him off your Christmas list . a fork in 'im , he 's done. e 's over , the fat lady is singing . " It does not have to be true , Zhaan . But I certainly would have slept better . I 'm sorry John , ' m not a very good liar . Si , vale Now , I know you couldn 't tell me the truth about your ... plan Maldis would have picked it out of my brain . But you had us all fooled with that scared Nelly routine . My fear wasn 't an act , John You were really that scared ? I 've never been more scared in my life .

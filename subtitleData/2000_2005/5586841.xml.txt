 A Pharaoh to Remember Up next , daring daylight robbery at a municipal swimming pool . This is it ! Turn me up ! Today , a foul-mouthed bandit robbed the municipal pool taking the contents of over three lockers . More like three lockers and a sink . - You had something to do with this ? - Of course not ! Holy Spitz ! He 's sporting skintight Speedos . - They don 't leave much to be imagined . - On a robot , they do . One human saw the robber ... Here we go . Here we go . ... describing him as a nasty , muscular ... Make me famous , bighead ! ... Caucasian human male . What ? What am I going to watch and drink all day ? This is an outrage ! Why pull the biggest pool caper if nobody knows you did it ? - Well , there 's the material rewards . - You mean this junk ? All I ever wanted was for people to remember my name . It 's Bender . Why bother remembering anything ? You 'll forget it five seconds later . It 's so unfair . A debonair robot with a zesty , in-your-face outlook doomed to obscurity like the rest of you , especially Leela . If I died tomorrow , no one would even notice . Boy , I 've never seen him so down , or ever before . How does a nobody like me get famous ? I know ! I 'm stuck , but I haven 't given up hope ! Call a soft-news journalist ! - You 're not stuck . - Shut up ! Hey , everybody , do The Bender ! This move 's called The Bender ! This circle 's about free expression not fascist moves ! A blank wall ! Fame is mine ! No one will forget how I live or my attitude regarding butt . All right , ladies . Let 's flush these artist lofts straight to hell ! No ! I 'm the first one to work . A new low . Surprise ! Happy funeral , Bender ! A surprise funeral , for me ? To show you that you 'll be remembered . Now , if the deceased will kindly take his place of honor . Cushiony ! And a minibar ! Dearly beloved , we are here to remember Bender crushed by a runaway semi driven by the Incredible Hulk . Aw , you knew my favorite cause of death . Let 's remember the best things about Bender , in our own way . Professor ? Your standard bending unit is made of an iron-osmium alloy . But Bender was different . Bender had a.04-percent nickel impurity . It 's what made me me ! If you needed a package brought into the country without x-raying Bender always had a free body cavity . - The professor 's was better . - You 're supposed to be dead . Say how great I am . And where 's the crying ? You people look like you 're waiting for the bus . Who-y-boy ? You 're at my funeral , singing about some dead stiff named Danny-boy ? You really are a massive bonehead ! - I 'm expressing sorrow . - Get lost ! I 'd say , " Don 't quit your day job , " but you 're bad at it too ! - We 're trying our best . - Your best is an idiot . Pick it up , people . So far , it 's been crap after crap . I croaked . Now , show me some love . - Bender was a truly special ... - Louder and sadder ! - Bender was a truly special ... - Next ! - Dear Lord ... - Oh , next ! Surely there 's someone here who knows how great I was . Yes , there is , Bender . Bender was a lot of things to a lot of people . Looking back , the number-one thing I can say about him is this : Bender was my friend . What ? ! That 's it ? Who are you ? You 're nobody ! This is the worst funeral ever ! I hope you 're happy ! You 've convinced me life is worth living by showing how bad my funeral will suck ! I know whose funeral we 'll attend next . Oh , stop . News , everyone ! Today you 're going to O 'Cyris Four to deliver this enormous sandstone block . I thought something looked different in here . Hi . We have a giant stone to deliver . Sign here . Nice ! Much like the 1 0 million identical stones already used in the future tomb of our great Pharaoh Hermenthotip . Impressive . Who 'll build it ? - You . - Say again ? You are now slaves of the great Pharaoh Hermenthotip . Guards ! Call it a hunch , but I 've got a bad feeling about this . The bad thing about being a slave is , they don 't pay you or let you go . That 's the only thing about being a slave . Attention ! You are now possessions of Pharaoh Hermenthotip bringer of the good aspects of the annual floods ! This place is like the ancient Egypt of my day ! That is no coincidence . Our people visited your Egypt thousands of years ago . Insane theories : one . Regular theories : a billion ! We learned much from the Egyptians . Pyramid building , space travel and how to prepare our dead so as to scare Abbott and Costello . Also Wolfman . Look at these swanky tombs ! These people know how to die . They worked thousands of people to death making these stupid monuments ! Spend your whole life building a guy 's toe , you 'll remember him . I think I 'm gonna like it here . I noticed your sign . I thought I 'd look into your program . We make you starve to death . One , two , three , pull ! One , two , three , pull ! Aw , bloody chunder ! Pick it up , people ! We 're enslaved to do a job ! Master , do we have to count to three ? Couldn 't we count to one ? Or one-half ? Good idea , slave . One-half , pull ! One-half , pull ! Now we 're slaving ! Pharaoh 's counting on us ! Work faster ! Like this : That 's motivating me ? Don 't whip with your arms . The power comes from your hips . Like this : Quit giving the slave drivers pointers ! - Remember who your friends are ! - I 'll tell you who I remember ! Enoughsis ! Pullutut ! What 's-His-Name ! He was the greatest of all . Pharaoh Hermenthotip approaches ! Hurry ! Pharaoh 's coming ! Get that nose in place ! Come on ! Excellent work ! I 'm very proud of all you slaves ! Viva Hermenthotip ! And now , I have a grand announcement . In honor of your achievement , you 're all hereby ... No ! Tell the slaves they can all go ... Go faster ? I told them , but they 're lazy . No . I mean , they 're all free . - Freeloading off you ? I agree . - No , I ... Pharaoh Hermenthotip is dead . He 's whipping angels now . We commend the body of Hermenthotip to the abode of the damned . The damned good-looking . Pharaoh commanded me to tell that joke at his funeral . I 'll always remember you , Hermenthotip . To equip Pharaoh for his journey , we bury him with his favorite things . Such as his heart and liver . And the many goods he left in his royal garage . Also this bag of cats our culture considers holy . Pharaoh , my god-king , You are cold and deceased I used to have him sing P - P-P-Pharaoh and his pets But the years went by And Pharaoh died Susie will have joined him In the afterlife Hermenthotip is gone . The time to designate a new Pharaoh is at hand . Wow ! At dawn , the high priest will consult the Wall of Prophecy to determine Hermenthotip 's successor . That ends the funeral . You don 't have to go home , but you can 't stay here . Can you believe it ? Pharaoh 's dead ! Yes ! Tonight we are slaves to no one ! Except the rhythm . Yeah ! Play those bongos ! I 'm gonna spin till I fall down ! We interrupt this ancient prophecy to bring you a late-breaking bulletin . Great Wall of Prophecy ! Reveal to us God 's will that we may blindly obey ! Free us from thought and responsibility ! - We shall read things off you ! - Then do them ! - Your words guide us ! - We 're dumb ! You know what else stinks about being a slave ? The hours . The prophecy is strange and crudely drawn at best . It indicates that we are here and our next Pharaoh is over there , near some tents . Those are waves , jackass ! It 's supposed to be a river ! - I know who the next Pharaoh is ! - Oh , lord . We hear your voice , great Pharaoh ! Reveal yourself to us ! Behold ! I have emerged from the place of spells and fairies ! It is he , just as the Wall of Prophecy prophesied ! Long live Pharaoh Bender ! - Long live Pharaoh Bender ! - This society is a bunch of idiots . People of O 'Cyris Four ! Welcome a man who started as a slave , but worked up to lord of all creation ! Our new Pharaoh , Bender ! Citizens of me ! The cruelty of the old Pharaoh is a thing of the past ! Let a whole new wave of cruelty wash over this lazy land ! What did he say ? Hear the word of Pharaoh ! Build unto me a statue of ridiculous proportion ! One billion cubits in height that I might be remembered for all eternity ! And be quick about it . - Lowly slave ! Why are you not working ? - I am ! I meant , " Yourself to death ? " Pharaoh , it hurts when I breathe . Well then , what do you think you should stop doing ? Crawl , pigs ! The Pharaoh has spoken ! Your task is nearly completed . Don 't let down Pharaoh now ! The great monument is finished , oh , Pharaoh ! And now the unveiling ! Remember me ! Remember me ! Remember me ! Does it please you , my lord ? It 's a good start . Yeah , it 's definitely big . I just wonder if it 's too big , you know ? Are people gonna be remembering me or the statue ? We made it to your exact specifications . Too exact , if you ask me . Tear it down and try again ! But this time , don 't embarrass yourselves ! Ladies and gentlemen , the Pharaoh suddenly died . - Good riddance . - What about my servants ? - Oh , yeah . - Right . Bender , I really hope that 's you , because if it isn 't we 're in trouble . You jerk ! Why 'd you have to drag us along ? I wanted to watch you remember me . You thought you 'd need this junk in the afterlife ? Afterlife ? If I had to go through another life , I 'd kill myself . Rot in peace . Fry and I are leaving . Sorry , but we 're totally sealed in . Nothing can get in or out except millions of snakes . Have a pomegranate schnapps from my distillery and start sharing fond memories of me , Bender . What proof is this ? Some huge number ? It 's explosive ! We could ignite the distillery and blow this place to rubble ! Let 's get a little kindling going . You can 't blow up my monument ! I won 't be remembered ! Oh , right . How selfish of me . We 'll just stay here forever . Hey , Fry ? Remember that robot , Bender ? Bender ? Doesn 't ring a bell . - Did you hear something ? - No . I bet it wasn 't someone good at stealing . Stop it ! It 's not right ! You 've crossed a line ! - You know who I remember ? - Let it be me . - That guy who used to bend things . - Me ? Please ? - Hermes ! - All right , all right ! If it means that much to you , blow up my statue . Oh , Bender ! When did you come in ? Hold still . Let 's blow this tomb . Pharaoh Bender ! He once more walks among the living ! How we doing ? Remember me ! I will . I will . Please just leave me alone . I understand your desire to be remembered but you don 't need a statue for that . - I don 't ? - No . You have your legacy as a brutal , tyrannical dictator and that will outlive any monument . - You think they 'll remember me ? - Absolutely . Well , in that case , one planet down . Helmsmen , set course for Earth ! - That 's not Earth . - Oh .

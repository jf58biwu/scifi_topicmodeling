 What do you make of this ? What is it ? Clive thinks he 's found a volcanic pipe . Elementary geology , pal . There are no volcanoes around here . Ergo no volcanic pipes , and therefore no diamonds . I don 't think I 've found a pipe . I think there 's something on this readout that looks like a pipe . It 's weird . - Where is it ? - About six , seven kliks that way . Jesus ! Have you seen anything like this ? It 'sjust a bloody lump of sandstone . Maybe some kind of pressure dome . It 's weird , though . Well , let 's take some samples and get going . Hey , guys , come and have a look over here . Emergency . Temperature drop . What 's happening ? System failure on the Antarctica module . It 's not responding . Primary feed valve 's iced up . I 'm gonna activate the bypass . You work on re-routing the secondary . Come on , Mel , they 've got less than a minute . Zack ! Where the hell are you ? We 're right here , Barb . Hang in there . Mel , find the glitch . We flight tested this situation a thousand times . What 's happening ? Terry 's starting to hypotherm out here ! Any second now . Mel ? I can 't find it ! - lt 's forty degrees below outside ! - Sequence analyzer to override . - It 's not designed for this matrix . - I know , just do it . - The whole system could shut down . - Mel , I know . Just do it . He 's going into shock ! Just do it ! It 's stabilizing , Zack . Temperature 's rising . Sorry about that , guys . Won 't happen again . For the money , the sooner we replace them with druids , the better . You 're all heart , Doc . Good work , guys . There 's a site call-out for a systems analyst . You 're it , Zack . Shit ! This cannot be happening . Listen , I 've got ajackhammer running through my head ... and I think I left my tongue somewhere over the Atlantic . I don 't suppose ... What 's that ? Tylenol ! Cool . Extra strong . Hi . You look like shit . It 's nice to meet you too . No , I ... Welcome to hell . Hi . I 'm Doctor Zack Straker . I 'm making a site call at C camp . Apparently I 'm supposed to clear security here . - Hi . - Passport , please . That water system , was that your bright idea ? Yeah , I designed it . So you 're the oke who 's got everyone drinking each other 's piss ? It 's recycled . The water 's distilled . It 's more pure than the snowmelt from the Himalayas . You won 't catch me drinking it . Jesus ! Fatty Nghuza works up at C camp . Enough said . You okay ? Hot , hot , hot . An alarm went off down on the south side . Another snake in the electric fence . Look at this . Big one , too . I need to see your case . That 's kinda personal . Call me an optimist . - What 's this ? - It 's Charlie . He 's cute . It 's a prototype . It 's a subterranean analyzer . What does it do ? Well , it sees through rock strata and ... it can find water up to a hundred feet deep . I can do that with a fucking twig , mate . I hope he lasts longer than the last one . If you 'd like to fill that out . Mikki ? Is this what you 're looking for ? Give it to her . Well , fuck you and the horse you rode in on , pal . He 's one bone-headed son of a bitch ! Could have handled it myself , Karl . I 'm sure you could have . Some prospector have managed to get themselves lost . I guess it 's your lucky day . Thanks . Why , exactly ? The truck 's taking emergency fuel up to the Zone ... and we pick up the prospectors en route . How long will it take ? About sixteen hours if we go straight through . All depends on how long it takes to find them . Is there a problem ? Baby , there 's no problem when old Kurt 's around . So what you doing then ? Listen , I do the technical shit ... you drive . Okay ? - You riding with us ? - Yeah . First time in the desert , I want to see it up close . You 'll get that all right , my friend . What 's with all the fire power ? Last month , one of our trucks was hijacked by rebels . Shot up the fuel tanker ... wiped out the driver . Not a pretty sight . Rebels , huh ? They 're after the diamonds . You 'll only frighten the poor baby . All aboard ! How much more of this is there ? From here on in , pal ... nothing but sand and rock for another thousand kilometers . Jesus ! Who ever heard of prospectors getting lost , huh ? Hey , Magda ? Which truck did they say was missing ? Harvey Slater 's outfit . Clive is on that truck . Got it , Magda . To your right . About four o 'clock . Ja , that 's them . Hang on tight , here we go . Is it Clive ? Yep . And I think that 's what 's left of Paul . You ever done a murder investigation ? - So what we do ? - Call in the police . They 've only been dead for ... six , seven hours , but look at the state of them . Yep . - D 'you know who 's missing ? - Probably Harvey . If I catch the fucker , he 's dead . You can 't think Harvey did this ? I see two bodies . One missing . Until I speak with Harvey , he 's it . Hey ! Karl ! Over here ! Titus has got something . Okay , Harvey . We 've got you now , boy ! I don 't understand . What ? When we started ... there were two feet . But now there 's four here . These tracks go on for bloody miles . It 's bizarre . What are they ? Kurt . Go get Magda to bring the truck . They 'll pick us up . Don 't . Sorry . A religious thing , huh ? No , not my religion . They 'rejust a warning . Let 's get out of here . Let 's get out of here . Now . Come on , Magda . He 's running ! There 's not much left . I 've never seen anything like it . - Any sign of a struggle ? - Not that I can see . Listen ... I think Harvey Slater 's on the run . Get me some experts up here . A forensics , or something . Roger . But it 'll take a couple of days to organize . So get up to C camp for further instructions . Negative . I 'm gonna find Harvey first . If the wind come up , his tracks will be gone by tomorrow . To the left there , Magda , over that dune . Now what ? Are you gonna tell me he ran thirty or forty kliks ... then died , then got eaten clean , all in about nine hours ? - I 'm not telling you anything . - Maybe you 're confused . - Maybe you think these are footprints . - Please . Please . It 's impossible . It 's the wrong body , guys . Harvey 's back there somewhere . Didn 't Harvey Slater have a motorbike crash a couple of years back ? - Stuffed up his leg real bad ? - He had a limp . He had a plate . - How are you doing , Harvey ? - This cannot be Harvey fucking Slater ! This is a dead end . We have to retrace our steps . The guys at basejust said we 've gotta stop playing detective . We 've got to get this fuel up to C camp . There 's a killer out there , Magda . If we move up north now , we will never catch him . It 's not our call , Karl . Well , you do what you want . - I 'm going after him . - It 'll be dark in an hour . We 're here for the night . There 's a site call-out for a systems analyst . I don 't do fieldwork . I like the outfit , by the way . It 's natty . Michaela . But everybody calls me Mikki . I don 't understand . When we started ... there were two feet . But now there 's four here . - Tokolosh . - A religious thing ? Not my religion . It 's just a warning . It 's just a warning . So cool . Hey , surfer boy ! You almost gave me a heart attack . Did you see me out there ? - You should try that . - Maybe some other time . Like in the morning . Oh , shit , I 'm keeping everyone up ! Well , you and Charlie . Damn thing 's been beeping all night . It still needs some work . It 's freezing ! That 's the desert for you . Too hot during the day and ... well , it 's ... too cold at night . Relax , townie . Body warmth . Stay close , stay warm . First rule of survival out here . I think I could learn to like this body warmth kind of thing . In some countries ... we 'd be considered engaged by now . God ... people still get engaged ? Round here , we don 't get much beyond the screwing stage . I ... Relax . Are you and Karl ... We ... had a brief thing . Past tense , huh ? And you ? My work keeps me pretty busy . I design extreme survival systems . Would you two shut up out there ? I 'm gonna head back in . I think I 'll stay out here for a while . Well , don 't freeze , all right ? Wake up ! Wake up , people ! There 's something out there ! - What ? - Karl , I 'm serious , man . - There is something out there . - Oh , come on ! We 're in the middle of the desert . Whatever it is you 're smoking or drinking , either stop it ... or share it out , all right ? I 'm not kidding . It was as big as a goddamn grizzly bear ! This is Africa . There are no bears ! I know that , Karl ! It wasn 't a tiger or a rhino or a gorilla either . What 's your problem , then ? My problem is that Bigfoot nearly cashed my check ! What ! Oh , great . Sleep it off . What are we supposed to do ? The bones are gone . What are you talking about ? Okay , what 's the game ? You 'd better tell me right now . You think this is a game ? What did you do with the bones ? You listen to me , pal . There is some very weird shit going on out here . What I just saw ... you think it 's impossible ? - But I just fucking saw it . - You explain that , then . I 'm a scientist . I find facts , I collect data ... - and I derive conclusions . - So , start fucking deriving ! What 's going on ? I have no idea . - Yet . - That 's great . So much for science . It 's a Tokolosh . What is that ? Tokolosh ? You know sometimes bad shit happens ? Here it doesn 'tjust happen . A Tokolosh does it . You walk into a door , a Tokolosh caused it . You bang your thumb with a hammer . Tokolosh ! A fucking asteroid wipes out the planet . Tokolosh . Karl ... you are starting to piss me off . It 's bullshit , Titus . With a capital bull ! - Have you ever heard of Esikhulu ? - What 's that ? The Sandmother . She was the first . And she will be the last . She takes what belongs to her . The animals . The people . And she drinks the life from their bones . And this way she lives forever . Brother fights against brother . Father turns against son . She breaks people ... apart . Come on , people . Let 's move it out . Over here . Guys . Got it . Footprints go up the side of the dune . Karl ? Karl ? - What ? - Over here . Now we go and catch this son of a bitch . Let 's go ! Come on , Magda . We 're moving . Twenty minutes . Then we can go . - Now ! - It 's dark , Karl . So bloody what ? How are you gonna follow footsteps in the dark ? With your torch ? Jesus , Magda ! We 're trying to catch a multiple murderer . Give us a break , man ! This isn 't my call , Karl . And when we can see what we 're following , then we go . Until then , this baby stays put . Do you want to radio it in ? Does anybody want to radio in and tell the folks back home ... how we 've got it all under control ? Just over the dune . Magda , kill the engine . Come on . Mikki ? Titus . There ! Son of a ... What the fuck is that ? We 've got him . Give me that . D 'you hit him ? What happened ? I heard a gunshot . Nothing . Just a pile of bones . - Harvey . - It 's the same bones . - What happened , Karl ? - I don 't fucking know , Titus ! You catch him ? What the hell is this place ? Are you okay ? Fine . You ? No , I 'm not okay . I 'm about as far away from okay as possible . Stop bloody whining . - This is way beyond my frame reference . - You should speak to ol ' Titus , then . To him it 's all meat and potatoes . I 'm warning you , man . Don 't push me . It can 't have gone far . Get this bloody heap going . Check the ammo . You know what it is , don 't you ? When I was a young man ... one of our shepherd boys wandered off . And a few hours later , his skull was found ... picked clean . Bones that walk . And flesh that disappears . You call it whatever you want . We call it Esikhulu . Come on , Magda . Let 's move . He 's running again . - Out ! Everyone out ! - Clear ! What was that all about ? - Kurt , fix this crap ! - Well , the battery 's okay . But half the insulation 's gone from the wiring . So , can you fix it ? Give me a week and a full workshop , no problem . Somebody better get on the field radio and let the mine know ... that we need some help . Calling Eland Mine , this is Echo Zero Three , are you reading ? Calling Eland Mine . Anyone out there ? This is Echo Zero Three , is anybody reading this ? The damn thing 's broken . I 'm gonna try an emergency beacon . It 's about damn time . Hey , come back ! - Come back ! - He 's seen us . Don 't panic , china . They 'll send a rescue truck for us in a couple of days , okay ? - Yeah ? How do you know ? - We might look like clowns ... but believe it or not , we actually know what we 're doing . All right , but we 're out here for two days . - This is an emergency . - Why ? We 've got supplies . They send a truck , we get a tan . It 's better than working . Magda , what have you got in here ? Shop said I was a fool , thought I 'd never use it . K-rations . Tastes like crud , but it 's better than nothing . Are you gonna wear that ? It 's gonna be cold tonight . - I 'm gonna find a rock . - Mikki , go with Magda . Who suddenly made you the boss ? It 's either Mikki or me . Nobody does anything by themselves anymore . We already have three dead bodies . Jesus , it stinks in here ! Titus . Your watch , buddy . Seen anything ? Kurt . Kurt ? Shit ! Karl ! Karl ! It 's got Kurt ! Karl ! Come here ! What is that ? It 's okay . Get him up off the ground . Get him in the truck ! - Karl , get out of there ! - Pull him . Help me get him back to the truck . - Oh my God ! - Move it ! They 're still coming ! Enough shooting . Plan B. - Karl , what the hell are you doing ? - Torch them ! - I 've got to reload . - I 'm not gonna end up like Kurt ... and the others . There 's a thousand litres of fuel , Karl . You 're gonna take us all with you . Oh God ! - I walk through the valley ... - Pray hard , sweetheart . Sometimes ... praying just isn 't enough . No , wait . Look ! They 're turning away . See anything ? Nothing . That should steady him . He 's losing a lot of blood . He 's in shock . We 've got to get him to a hospital . Soon . What else have you got ? In that first-aid kit ? I 'm gonna go pour out more fuel . Move . Now ! What the hell are you doing ? It 's turning away . Let it go ! Enough . If you two want to behave like arseholes , that 's fine by me ... but right now , if we don 't work together , we 're finished . If I see any more of this crap ... Are we clear ? Well ... shooting it wasn 't working . So what are you gonna do ? Reason it to death ? Buy us some time . There 's a system at work here , Karl . - Methodology . - You tell that to Kurt and Titus . - We 've got to get him help , fast . - The prospector truck has a radio . That 'll take a good two days . At first light , we move out . You want to carry him forty kliks across the desert ? That 's gonna help ? - What else can we do ? - She will ... tear you apart . Leave Titus with me . I can medicate him ... - and pray . - Oh , enough mumbo-jumbo . I say we all go . We don 't have a choice . Who 's we , Karl ? I have a choice . I 'm staying . There 's enough fuel in this thing to wipe out anything that might come back . Leave Titus with me . His chances are better if he stays here . That 's one hell of a choice , babe . You were ready to roast us all back there . You leave that whisky alone and you start bloody thinking clearly ! The Sandmother . - She is searching for her children . - Take it easy , man . Not now , Titus . Karl . That thing . If it is searching ... I 've never seen anything like it before . Maybe he 's right . It 's changing and ... it 's evolving right in front of our eyes . The Sandmother . She takes what belongs to her . Then she drains the life from their bones . She breaks people ... apart . Come on . Where is it ? I 'm getting a reading from somewhere there . That 's great . That thing of yours is useless . Can 't even find the water that we 're supposed to find . It doesn 'tjust find water . It also analyses if it 's safe or not ... by determining its acidity . Right now I 'm getting a reading that 's right off the scale . From what ? Ants . Formic acid . Ants have formic acid . It 's what they use to kill their prey . It 's one of the most powerful acids there is . Ants ! Look . What the hell is that ? Sandstorm . Take cover . - Where ? - Move it ! There 's sand everywhere . - Are we all okay ? - Where 's the fuel ? Thejerrycan . It 's almost empty . Charlie ... It 's fucked . So , my friend ... are we . - How much further ? - We could go right past it . He 's right . Let 's stop here for the night and carry on in the morning . The prospector 's truck can 't be far . We should rest for the night . Well ... this is about as bad place as any . This gasoline should keep it away . That 's the end of it . You know ... this petrol will evaporate soon . Yeah . What 's that sound ? - It 's the sound of the desert . - What ? It 's when ... the grains of sand roll against each other . They create this ... vibrating moan . What causes the grains of sand to roll against each other ? Normally the wind . There is no wind . My God ! Magda ! It got Magda . What the fuck is that ? Ants . Listen . Radio . That 's the prospector 's truck . It must bejust over that dune . Lucky the radio still works . Johan will be here soon . Take a look at this . Karl . Give me your flashlight . - What is it ? - I don 't know for sure , but ... it looks like some kind of nursery . A nursery ? For what ? The queen . What ? That creature . Esikhulu . It 's ants . The ants on Titus ... they were solid , man , like flesh . That 's it ! They just want the bones . It gives them structure like a skeleton . When you shot up the sleeping bag , we smashed up the bones . So then it needed one of us . But why ? Survival . Her home 's been busted up . She can 't go anywhere alone . Give her a set of bones ... she can go everywhere . Ants ? That 's impossible . Why ? They 've been here since before the dinosaurs . Millions of years . It 's like Titus said . Esikhulu . In the heart of the colony ... lies the queen . Karl ? Get out of the hole . Drop your gun . Now ! Mikki , drop your gun now . You 're under arrest . Move . Down on your knees . Don 't be stupid , Johan . We don 't have time for this . Shut up ! They sent me to sort out this mess . Where are the others ? - They 're all dead . - Back up there . Who 's dead ? The prospectors . Magda , Titus , Kurt ... - Magda , dead ? Bullshit ! - Listen to us , Johan . Why ? You 're supposed to be at C camp . And now you people are all here . - And half you crew 's dead . - No one killed anyone . Don 't you see ? - It 's Esikhulu . - Jesus ! You people are bloody crazy . I know what happened here . The prospectors found a diamond pipe and they probably grabbed some stones . You think we stole the diamonds ? Fucking a , pal . And now I got the whole lot of you . You 're gonna sit for a long time . Nice try , sweetheart . Now , get across there with your boyfriend before I get really cross . - You always were a pig , Johan . - Was that your secret weapon , Karl ? You 're gonna have to try a lot harder than that . Get in the bloody truck ! - Fuck you ! - Move ! Maybe when we get back to the fuel truck ... he 'll see what we 're talking about and let us go . This idiot 's been itching to take me down . If he finds what 's left of Titus and Magda ... he 'll use that against us . Look and learn , my friend . Look and learn . Karl ! Stop ! He 'll come around soon . He 'll be okay . - Now let 's get out of here . - Not yet . We 're going after it . Are you crazy ? This is our chance . Mikki , this thing is too unique . We can 'tjust walk away from it . - This thing is a fucking killer ! - Exactly . And right now , it 's between us ... and C camp . Now , it 's looking for a nest . Some place it can ... - Start a new colony . - Right . The old Evangeline Mine . That 's right . This time we level the playing field . Gently , gently . Nitroglycerin . - Hey , what about me ? - You ? - You can eat shit and die . - You 're under arrest for murder ! Does it look like I 'm under arrest ? I 'll get you for this , Karl . I swear ! Shit ! Just point and shoot . All right . It could be anywhere . We 're never gonna see it . Guys . It 's a generator . Forget it . This place has been out of use for ages . It 's still got compression . Let me see your knife . You 're wasting time , man . All right , smart ass . Now , let 's get down to business . We have to go low . The nest 'll be buried . Watch your step , guys . There it is ! Mikki . You want to play hard to get , do you ? - Karl ! - What ? - We should stick together . - Stop ! Get down ! It wants you to go in there . Let it comes to us ! No ! We must finish it now ! Karl ! Karl , get out of there ! Get out of there ! Here ! You okay ? Not bad for a city boy . - It 's got me by the leg ! - Hang on . - Oh God ! - We got you . Karl ! Hang on ! Get out , it 's gonna blow . It 's starting to collapse ! It 's the queen . Mikki , look ! It 's like a giant brain . The central intelligence . The walls are moving ! Mikki ... This is the controlling organism . Then let 's kill the bitch and get out of here ! Kill it ! Do it now ! - I can 't . - We 've got to get out of here . Kill it ! Kill it ! Come on ! Run ! It 's through here . Are you okay ? I 've been better . It 's all right . It 's over . Come on . Oh my God ! Johan ! What ? Well ... they 've isolated that place so well ... there 's nothing that can get through . You know ... I think I could get into this fieldwork stuff . Does that mean ... you 'll be moving round more ? Yeah . I mean , there 's plenty of time later to think about settling down . Amen to that . There 's a big world out there . Wouldn 't want to paint it . Here . You should have this . Maybe we should get ... - the spares for the mine . - Yeah . Come . Okay , let 's put this in the back of the taxi . Are you sure you won 't come ? I 'm not ready to go back . They still need me up at the C camp . Fatty Nghuza . Take care of yourself , surfer boy . Esikhulu .

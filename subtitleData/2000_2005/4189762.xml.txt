 Oh , it 's a horrible place to be buried if you ask me . What was that ? This hill reminds me of the barrows in southern England . It does ? Yeah . Running through the hills in Wessex ... I used to love it as a little girl . Until someone told me they were graves ! - Ancient graves . - Man-made hills to bury the dead . There 's something very repulsive about that to me . The dead are best forgotten , not glorified in some macabre fashion . We 're the product of our ancestors , Marguerite . We can 't escape that . No , we are who we choose to be . At least I am . Oh , not to worry , this isn 't a burial site . It 's just a hillside like any other . Why isn 't it that Challenger can never keep up with us ? We 're never going to make it back to the treehouse at this rate ! Come on now , my lovely . Haven 't you collected enough insects for one day ? Oh , insects and arachnids , Marguerite , I saw the most interesting spider crawl down into this hole . Come on now , my pertinacious little pet ! Careful she doesn 't pull you in and devour you , George . There must be something constructive we can ... do while we wait for Challenger . What have we here ? Care to do a little exploring ? Must we ? There you go , young lady . I 'd better catch up with Roxton and Marguerite . We can turn back any time you 're ready ! Looks like the end of the road . Someone went through a lot of trouble to seal up this passage . Celtic runes ! It must be thousands of years old ! Well , can you read it ? Through me is a way to eternal suffering , Abandon all hope , ye who enter here . Didn 't Dante write that ? Apparently he was not the first . Roxton ! Marguerite ! Oh , they must have gone in here . Roxton ! Fire ants ! This is a curious place for them to make a home ! If they had wanted somebody to open ... it they would have installed a doorknob ! Well , aren 't you the least bit intrigued ? No ! Look ! Just this once let 's heed the warning ... - and turn back , hmm ? - All right , if you insist . Yes . Coal gas ! Roxton ! Marguerite ! At the dawn of the last century A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out ... of the Lost World Are you hurt ? Shaken but not damaged , I think . Oh ! I hope there 's another way out of here . Do you think it caved in all the way back to the entrance ? More than likely , I would say . What caused that explosion ? Coal gas exposed to an open flame . We 're lucky this part of the tunnel didn 't collapse as well . Lucky ! We 're a hundred yards or more underground ! What about Challenger ? Well , if he was in the tunnel , we can only hope that he made it out . If he wasn 't in the tunnel , then he ... still would have heard the explosion ! - That 's a good point . - Challenger ! - Challenger ! - Can you hear us ? That was quite a lump on the noggin . Oh , what am I doing here ? This is treacherous terrain . I must have tripped and banged my head . I think I 'll sit down ... here and sort things out . What was I doing ? What 's this ? Insects ? ! Now that is curious ! Fishing line ! Insects ! Fishing line ! Now we 're getting somewhere ! I 'm a fisherman ! Wouldn 't get many fish in there ! And where 's my rod ? I must have lost it , not ! It can 't be far away . Perhaps I was attacked by a wild animal ! Yes ! And I used the rod to fend them off ! Ow . Maybe I was ... robbed and left here to die . I don 't seem to have any money . Save your breath , Marguerite . He can 't hear us . No , He 's still collecting his bloody insects , blithely unaware that anything has happened to us ! It 's more than likely that he 's gone back to get Veronica and Finn . Look , you wait and see ! They 'll be back in no ... time with tools to dig us out of here . Looks like we don 't have much choice . In the meantime ... shall we see what 's behind this sealed door ? Abandon all hope , ye who enter here . Not much to look at , but at least it 's empty . You don 't suppose there are any creatures in there , do you ? Only one way to find out , Marguerite . Care to go for a swim ? Whatever lives in there is welcome to it . It doesn 't seem to be any more coal gas in here , at least . I 'm happy to live without it . Can 't live with it , that 's for certain . My guess would be it 's been ... seeping in through the cracks in the walls . Probably been building up in here since the place was sealed off . Is that what the warning was about ? Well , could be . Trouble is , coal gas is more or less invisible , but you can 't always smell it either . You really are trying to cheer me up here , aren 't you ? Looks like the only way out is back the way we came in . Oh , terrific . That 's a hell of a lot of rock to move by hand . In other words , this is where we 've come to die . Oh , Marguerite , let 's not give into despair just yet , huh ? - This looks like an altar to me ! - It does ? Well , look , this stone has obviously be hewn by hand ! Well , maybe this place was used for religious sacrifices , or ... Wasn 't it you who said this place reminded you of a burial mound ? Yeah . Hey , Vee , watch this ! Pretty good , huh ? When I was a kid I could do a double back flip from there . Yeah ? Let 's see . Not right now , Finn , I 'm reading . - Maybe you can 't do it anymore . - Maybe I don 't want to . How about one of these ? - That 's easy . - Let 's see you do one ! Come on ! Please ! Anything for a little peace and quiet ! Help me move the furniture , there 's no point in destroying it . - What 's all this about ? - I 'd forgotten all about these . My mother put them here , we used to play hide-and-seek when I was little . This was home . Cool . Why do you think someone wedged this rock in here ? I don 't know . Could be there to block out that gas , or ... Oh no , let 's not make this any worse than already is . Or it could also be a tunnel . Or a tomb . Well that is a good point . - Best not disturb the dead . - What are you doing ? If there is another way out of here , then I want to know about it . Well , let 's not get our hopes up . Now who 's being pessimistic ? It 's jammed well . All right . Oh , what a smell ! The good news is it 's not coal gas . Looks like a woman . - Seen enough ? - No , wait ! What is it ? The symbol on the shroud . What symbol ? Marguerite ? I want to see it . All right ! Oh ! This means something to you . It 's the same as my birthmark . Damn the blackguard ... who stole my rod and reel a pox ... upon his wife and children . Can you see it ? Yes I can see it . And it 's not a bit like the symbol on that shroud ! It 's identical , Roxton ! And you know it ! Coincidence , Marguerite . Nothing more to it ! Whatever it is , I don 't want to look at it any longer . That 's all right . I 'll be fine , please . Fine . Great ! Well , it 's bloody heavy ! Now , what you 've done ? We 've got to stop this gas ! How ? Well , I don 't know , but we 'd better think of something ! Asphyxiation is not a very pleasant way to go ! What are you doing ? Mud ! Here ! Give me a hand ! All right . There 's not much of it . - Better than nothing ! - Come on ! It 's working ! Best hold it in place until it gets dry . This was a good idea . What ? Coming into this cave ? No ! Using the mud to stop the gas . Well , as long as it holds . This really isn 't your fault you know . My idea to go exploring . Well , I was the one who stepped on the bloody switch ! I was carrying the torch . You win . Well , what have we got here . Oh yes ! The bait ! Oh , this could be a vital clue . G.E.C. Geoffrey Edward Chaucer Gustav Enrico Caruso ! George Elliot Ca ... Ah ! What 's in a name ! Huh ! A fish is still a fish . Scoundrels ! Must have stolen my tackle box . This will have to do . What a resourceful fellow I am ! What ingenuity ! A regular Huckleberry Finn ! Finn ! why is that name so familiar ? Looks like it did the trick . Hard to say how much gas is in the air . Or how much oxygen we have left . Yeah , well , there is that technicality to consider . Have you noticed how quiet it is in here ? Meaning ? Meaning , if Challenger had gone back to the ... treehouse to get Veronica and Finn , they ... would have been here by now ! We 'd be able to hear them digging us out . Maybe , maybe not . We 're a hell of a long way inside the hillside . Roxton , you know as well as I do that there is no one out there ! No . Challenger would never abandon us , Marguerite . So something has happened to him . You and I are alone . If that 's the case , we 'd best get back to work . Those rocks won 't move themselves . What are you drawing ? My mother , the way I remember her from the dreams I 've been having lately . Since you 've been wearing the pendant , you mean ? I 've been dreaming about her every night . And this place called Avalon you think she lives in ? She does ! I don 't know , Vee . I mean , I know you believe all this stuff about your mom ... being the Protector of the Plateau and all but ... it sounds kind of weird to me . It doesn 't matter what you think , Finn . Not everything is black and white ! Some things are very complicated . My mother is the Protector of the plateau ... just as I will be one day . But you don 't even know what that means ! This is getting us nowhere ! We 're doing fine . Fine ! We 've moved what , two rocks ! Three ! Three rocks to be precise . Now come on , let 's get on with it . We don 't have a choice . Come on , on your feet ... - let 's get back to work ! - Stop ordering me around ! I am NOT ordering you around ! And if you 're going to rest , get out of the way ! Is this far enough for you ? ! You know , sometimes Marguerite , I really don 't know what I see in you . Well , sometimes I know exactly what I dislike about you ! - Now what ? - Get back to the main cave ! Brilliant ! Oh , dammit ! Is that all you have to say ? Well , what do you want me to say , Marguerite ? Do you think I made this happen ? You did ! Let 's get back to work . You have got to be kidding me ! No , I am not kidding . Why ? Are you giving up ? We 're not exactly making progress . Well what are you going to do , Marguerite ? Sit around and wait until we run out of oxygen ? No , I thought I 'd read a book . Then again , maybe we don 't need ... to wait until we run out of oxygen . Maybe this cave will start filling up with gas , then we can inhale it until we both pass out and die ! You know , sometimes I wonder why I even bother talking to you ! You know , I 've followed you around like a faithful servant , I 've put up with your contradictions , your deceptions , mixed signals , bloody secrets ! But if you are just going to throw your hands up in the air and ... just give up , you are on your own ! The way I have always been . I 'm getting out of here , with or without you ! - Good luck ! - Oh , I don 't need luck ! Anger is enough ! Call me when you see the light of day ! You know , I didn 't think you were a coward , I thought life was precious to you ! You don 't know anything about me ! I know more about you than I ever wanted to know ! But I give up ! You hear me ? You 're just not worth the effort . Because all you do is take ! You never give one miserable inch ! You 're cold , you 're empty , and if we ever get out of here ... we are finished ! Do you hear me ? I mean it ! So my aquanautical fiend , a frypan awaits you , I 'm just not quite sure where . Come on ! Come on ! I must have snagged it on a rock ! It 's bad enough that I can 't catch a fish . This is just embarrassing . Great nibbling Neptune ! * * * I 'm not afraid of you ! Overgrown minnow ! I suppose , I could have been a pugilist . Giving up ? I thought you were getting out of here , with or without me . Looks like you 're stuck with me . Not for much longer . You mind if I sit down ? So this is how it ends . Three years struggling to survive on this plateau , to end up here , trapped in some miserable cave running out of oxygen . Say something , Roxton . Please . I 'm sorry I lost my temper , I 'd never leave you behind . As much as I 'd like to sometimes ... I don 't care about your temper . I won 't forget those things that you said . I 'd give my last breath for you , Marguerite . You know that . Then tell me you 're going to get us out of here ! Tell me everything is going to be all right ! I wish I could . Why can 't you ? You always have before ! There 's nothing I can do to save us . I never thought it would come to this . Oh , God . I 'm so tired ! All I want to do is sleep . Is this your idea of an apology ? Finn ? Finn , where are you ? What are you doing ? How do you spell black ? B-L-A-C-K , Why ? One of Challenger 's experiments . He was watching them change colour or something . Said he had to check them every 6 hours . So , you 're helping him out . Well , he should have been back by now , I 'm just making some notes for him . For black . What does that mean ? It means it 's four o 'clock and the gunk in these tubes has gone black . Oh . Right . Weren 't they heading for the inland sea or something ? Well , that 's what they said . Maybe we should go look for them . I could use a swim . So could I , Come on . What is it ? Strangest dream I 've ever had . Strange in a pleasant way , I hope . I dreamed that we were captured by Druids , here on the plateau . That 's interesting . You were with me . So was Malone . The Druids were going to kill me , until they noticed my birthmark ! Why would the birthmark stop them ? They said I was the reincarnation of their ... high priestess ... only I could save them . You 've had that dream before . - No , I haven 't . - Yes , you have . I 'm sure of it . You 've told me that story before . Never ! You must have dreamt it yourself ! Unless it was inspired by being in these caves , and the ... Celtic runes on the door . Or perhaps it was all that talk about burial mounds . Yeah ! Makes sense . - Oh ! - What are you doing ? The woman , I have to see her ! See what ? That 's incredible . It can 't be . Druids here ? How can I be related to that ? Are you ? Look at it , Roxton ! That woman has the same birthmark as I do ! There 's bound to be a reasonable explanation . - Such as ? - Well , I don 't know . The body is ancient , Marguerite . So ? Well , did any member of your family ever come to South America ? I don 't know who my real family is , remember ? Of course . I 'm sorry . Oh , don 't be . It 's not your fault . But ... There is no such thing as mere coincidence . Who knows what other terrifying creatures ... lurk in this inhospitable landscape . Headhunters , most definitely . Cannibals , certainly . Giants ! Well , if there are sea monsters there are sure to be ... girls ! - Did you hear something ? - Nothing unusual . Stay right where you are ! What are you doing walking around in this jungle ? What 's going on , Challenger ? Are Roxton and Marguerite hiding around here too ? That 's far enough ! Challenger , stop fooling around . Challenger ? G. E. Challenger ? Is that who I am ? I think he 's finally lost it . Challenger , have you been drinking your experiments again ? Experiments ? Your name is George Edward Challenger . - You 're a scientist . - Scientist ? Am I famous ? And who are you ? I 'm Finn , and this is Veronica . We live with you . - Are you my wives ? - Brother ! Challenger , what happened to you ? You 're my daughters ! Does your mother know you 're walking around in the ... jungle half-dressed like that ? Challenger , put the gun down . Whatever happened to you , we 're here to help you . Help me ? I don 't need any help . We 'll take you back to the treehouse and ... you can tell us all about it , okay ? The treehouse ? What about Roxton and Marguerite Do you know where they are ? Are they my children too ? Oh boy , Come on . You 're not what I expected . I beg your pardon ? Those were the first words you said to me . When we met in London , right after Challenger 's lecture . I expected you to be a lot older . That 's funny . That 's what I expected of you . An old widow with money . You never told me that . I hadn 't really thought much about it after that day , I was too preoccupied with who you turned out to be . So I 've noticed . I 'm glad of that , at least . I have noticed more than that . Oh , really ? Would you care to elaborate ? - Now ? - Yeah . What 's the point ? The point is , Marguerite , we 're probably going to die in here . You may never get to say what you really think . Die here . With a corpse that COULD be my relative without ... never knowing who I really am . With all your emotions locked up inside . Oh , I have no emotions . Only calculated responses and ... poor imitations of feelings I once knew how to express . That 's not true ! I 've seen your anger and your pain , your laughter . Your sadness . It 's all there , just beneath the surface . Aching for release ? - Yes . - No . You deserve much more than me , Lord Roxton . You deserve much more than you allow yourself to have . I love you , Marguerite . Don 't you say I can 't ! Don 't pretend you can 't hear me . No , I 'm not pretending . Then why can 't you say it ? - Even if it isn 't true ? - Isn 't it ? It 's over . You can 't keep running away . Your future OUR future is now . I love you . But , um ... No more excuses . Roxton ? Over here . When did all of these cracks appear ? While we were sleeping . I think I 'm fighting a losing battle . Oh , I think you 're winning . Have I ever told you how beautiful you are ? Yes ! Many times . Don 't let go ! I don 't want this to end , I don 't want us to end . Ever . We sailed the sea far and wide , month after month ! No kidding ! We were searching for a great white whale ... the captain was obsessed by it . Ahab . Captain Ahab . That was his name ! And the whale 's name was Moby Dick ! Right you are ! Biggest whale in all of creation ! I read that book too , Challenger . Book ? I write books too ! ? Even with amnesia his ego is out of control ! We 'd better keep following this trail . - Try to keep up ! - Don 't worry about me , I 've walked all over this jungle . Yeah ! We noticed that . Oh , that 's interesting . It 's going up . Up to where ? Oh , Marguerite ! Marguerite ! Wake up . What ? The gas ! It 's going through those rocks up there ! Wake up ! That 's very pretty , need to sleep now . No time to sleep . Come on ! On your feet ! I wonder ... The hole where Challenger was ... fishing for insects it was jammed with rocks too . You don 't suppose this could be the other end ! Could be , I guess . Of course ! It 's to let the spirits out ! What 's that ? Like the burial chambers in Egypt . There was always a shaft ... to allow the spirits of the dead access ... to the sky above ... to continue their journey . Well , if that 's the case , why did they block it out ? They obviously didn 't want this particular spirit to ... escape . Why not ? Well , she 's your relative , Marguerite . You tell me . If I could just pry some of these rocks loose ... it could be our only chance . Another time my friends and I were in a small boat ... rowing across this vast lake , when we were attacked by a sea monster , just like the one I caught this morning . Somehow we managed to get a hook into its mouth , and it dragged us right across the lake ! It was the most incredible thing you 've ever seen ! Oh , will you quit with the fish stories already . - You 're driving me nuts ! - Wait ! - That one really happened . - It did ? See ? I am amazing . I 've been amazing since birth . A child prodigy no doubt . Do I play a musical instrument ? I know I sing a little . Perhaps I dance too . You 're so amazing you can 't even ... remember what happens to your friends ! I do remember collecting insects ! Now that sounds more like you . Do you remember where you were doing this ? Certainly . On a hilltop . Any particular hilltop ? Yes , of course . On the hilltop where I was collecting the insects . Terrific ! There can 't be more than a million hilltops around here ! There was an explosion , I think . An explosion ! Was anybody hurt ? That must have been how I lost my fishing rod ! Lost your brain more like it ! Marguerite ? Marguerite ! Oh , come on . Wake up . Oh , wake up . Come on , up you go . Roxton . I 'm right beside you . I 'm going to get us out of here , all right ? How ? I don 't know . Fire ! - What ? - Fire ! The gas is escaping through those rocks in the wall , just as it did when we opened the door to get in here . Sorry , I should have looked where I was going ... Oh , no , no , no . If we can ignite the gas , the shaft will act like a bloody ... cannon and blow those rocks sky high ! If we light a match ... the whole place will go up in flames ! We 'll be burned to death . Not if we 're underwater . Come on . There . I knew I could find it . I thought you said there was nothing in there ! I don 't think there is . Then why have you got the gun ? We need the bullet to create a spark . All right , Marguerite . Get in the water . You first . My pleasure . Look , no sea monsters . Come on , Marguerite . In you get . All right . How long can you hold your breath ? I 'm running out of breath to hold . It 'll be all right , take my hand . Ready ? On the count of three . One ... Two ... Three ! What 's happening ? Run ! Run ! - What was that all about ? - I don 't know . What 's that ? Marguerite ! there . What were they doing in there ? Maybe they were playing hide-and-seek with Challenger ! How is he ? He 's got quite a bump . We should get him back to the treehouse when you 're ready . And he thinks he 's the world 's greatest fisherman . What are you talking about ? He 's had amnesia . We found him wandering around in the jungle a little ways back . Might explain why he didn 't try to help us out of that cave . It didn 't look like you needed much help . I 'll get Marguerite . Oh , my head . Whoa ! Take it easy . Do you remember what happened now ? Yes . Of course , The cave in ! Explosion ! We 've got to get to Roxton and Marguerite ! No ! It 's okay . They are right over there . Up you come . Easy does it . Oh , what did I miss ? Did you ever hear the one about the fish that got away ? About what happened down there . You mean about you being the reincarnation of a Druid priestess ? Yes . Well , don 't you worry . Your newest secret is safe with me . Thank you .

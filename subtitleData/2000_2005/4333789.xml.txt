 Let me see your cards . Oh . Royal flush . Yeah , that 's not good . And now I must remove another article of clothing ? Sorry . Sarge , you 're missing all the fun . I 've already seen him naked . Hel , you wanna learn to play ? I 've got more important things to do , Cleo . Says you . Hel , scramble your team to Housing Level 215 immediately . What 's the problem ? The situation is critical . You 'll understand when you get there . Let 's go . Voice says we have a situation . Hey , come on . Oh . Just when I was on a streak . Mauser , we 'll be right back , so keep your shirt off . How much longer , Doc ? We 're almost finished . Anything else you want erased while I 'm in there ? Just get rid of the ex-wife , I 'll be happy . He does great work , doesn 't he ? Raina . Congratulations , Doc . Uh ... Why , you 've gone from leading scientist ... to discount lobotomist in , what , one year ? Of course , anyone 's reputation might be tarnished ... after their greatest work resulted in , well , me . Voice assured me you could be trusted ... with such dangerous powers . Voice lied to you , Doc . She didn 't want some meek little lab rat . You think she would 've given me the ability to get inside people 's minds if she didn 't want me to use it ? Funny thing is , I don 't even have my powers anymore . And I 'm still a bad little girl . And that 's where you come in . Look familiar ? My trans-plane generator ! Where did you find it ? Inside of this , huh . Packs one hell of a punch . My device isn 't designed to be a weapon . I created it to expand the powers of the mind . Well , that 's exactly why I looked you up , Doc . Uh . You 've got some expanding to do . Hey , Doc , I can still remember my ex . Uh , hello ! Voice didn 't say what this was about ? Just that it 's critical . Remember the last time Voice wouldn 't talk to you ? Yeah , we were chasing Raina . And she didn 't want her reading my thoughts . You think we 're dealing with another Psionic ? I hope not . One of those mind freaks is enough for me . Huh ! Uh . I don 't believe this . What do you have to do to kill this woman ? Come on , Cleo . Ah . Raina ! Let him go . Why isn 't she using her powers ? Maybe she doesn 't have them anymore . I mean , if she did , wouldn 't she have you and Hel blasting each other by now ? We 've got you pinned . Oh , my . How will I get out of this ? I know . Mmm . Whoa . Where 'd she get that ? I don 't know , but put your shields on max . Okay . Cheerio . Duck ! Cleo ? Five hundred years into the future , she will enter a world where machines rule the Earth . Mankind has been driven underground . And Cleopatra is about to discover there 's no place like home . " In the year 2525 " " There are women with the will to survive " " Fighting for a brand new day " " Nothing is gonna get in their way " " And in the year 2525 " " Three women keep hope alive " " Joining forces to reclaim the Earth " " Looking ahead to humankind 's rebirth " Subtitles by subXpacio Cleo . Mmm . Cleo ? CLEOPATRA 2525 2x07 " OUT OF BODY " There 's no trace of her . Nothing . What happened ? Oh . Head rush . Oh . Uh . Man , who died ? Voice . I need orders . Voice . I 'm fine , by the way , everybody . Thanks for asking . Okay . Come on , joke 's over , Hel . Hel , I 'm only reading two of you . We lost Cleopatra . God . I 'm dead . Raina showed up with some kind of weapon that went right through her shield . I 'm dead ! Hel , do something ! Hel , Raina is taking Dr. Lim to the facility where he first gave Raina her powers . I 'm truly sorry about Cleo but you and Sarge must continue the mission . We 're on our way . They can 't hear me . Hel ! Sarge . Uh ... Let 's get moving . We 're wasting time . At least she didn 't suffer . Like Dev . What ? She went quickly . Like Carla . Yeah . Who 's Dev and Carla ? Guys ? Guys ? We all take our chances , Hel . Even Cleo . Sarge , I wouldn 't even play her card game for five minutes . Oh ... I 'm already dead . What 's the worst that could happen ? Hel , don 't worry about the stupid card game . I totally forgive you . Better get focused , Hel . I 'm all right . Good . Fighting Raina 's hard enough without your feelings for Cleo distracting you . Oh , I forgive you , too , Sarge . You can 't help having the emotional capacity of The Terminator . It 's just who you are . Hey , wait up . Guys ! This way . Hurry it up , Doc . You , you did this to me . The trans-plane generator opens a window , a portal accessing the plane of Psionic energy . God knows what happens when you just start blasting people with it . Well , they do less talking , for one . Your procedure should have been permanent . How did you lose your P.S.I. abilities ? A Voice team nearly blew my head off . Oh . That was me . I put the hurt on you , big time . And the Bailies put me back together . But I suppose they got a little nervous when I could control them as easily as humans . When I came to , my powers were gone . Look at the suffering those powers have caused you . I should think you 'd be glad to be rid of them . My mind was expanded beyond anything that you could possibly comprehend . Do you think I 'd be satisfied with one of these ? I don 't know how you people stand it . You give me back my powers . Then I 'll find Voice and take care of unfinished business . Where is that ? Nothing to see here . That 's upstairs , right above us . Come on , Doc . Help me out here . You keep working , Doc . I 'll take care of company . No ! And , sweetheart , don 't you try anything clever . I can always take care of you , too . Raina 's coming for you , guys ! Let 's split up . We find her , get her from both sides . That way , one of us can nail her while the other one gets her attention . By getting vaporized ? Do you have any other ideas ? If Raina gets her powers back , we 're all dead . We have to surprise her . Hel ! She already knows you 're here . Sarge , I am focusing all of my mental energy to contact you from the spirit world . You are in grave danger . Ugh . Okay , you 're not even trying . Sarge , you have to try to listen to me . You don 't want to die . Your friends can 't hear you and you never get to go on missions or hang out or do-do each other 's nails or-or talk about programming Mauser for sex . Raina can still hear me . I 'm haunting her . Get away from my friends , you spoon-bending freak ! Stop it ! Who are you ? I 'm your worst nightmare . Oh , you 're not getting away that easy . This is kind of fun . How the hell did you dodge that ? I don 't know . I was thinking of Cleo and I felt something like this annoying presence . That 's sweet . I don 't do sweet . Mauser , what do you make of that weapon ? It seems to create a rift into another plane of existence . One of pure Psionic energy . Any solid matter that gets in its path just ceases to exist . Well , can you beef up our shields ? I 'll need more information . See if you can draw her fire . I 'll take readings through your gauntlet . Raina ? How does it feel to have someone mess with your mind for a change , huh ? That voice . I know that voice . Paybacks are hell , aren 't they ? You know , the Klingons always said that revenge is a dish best served - Oh . How sweet ! It 's that little ditz I blasted on the housing level . Oh , you are so lucky I am dead right now . Go . Mauser , do you have those readings ? I 'm sorry . I 'll need a sustained burst from the weapon . Try and get her to fire at you again . And if you can get a little closer , it would help . Raina . Oh . Psych . Made you look . Enough of this ! Doc , you better be ready to fix me . Too close . Ooh-hoo . Mauser , did you get those readings ? Yes . More than enough . Thank God . And I 'm sorry to say , there is no way to deflect that weapon . Hel . Hmm . I just saw Cleo . Sarge . No , I did . Just for a second . And I felt her before , too , inside . Oh , Sarge , you 've gotta let me go . Sarge , I miss Cleo , too , but we saw her get vaporized . Mauser , I want you to run every scan you can on this location . Hel , I 'm picking up trace readings of decoherent matter but I can 't get a lock on it . Could it be Cleo ? I can 't tell . But if Raina 's weapon knocked solid matter into a different plane of existence then it 's possible that Cleo is still intact . Hold the phone . What ? You mean she 's here , but we just can 't see her ? I knew I couldn 't be dead . I am not at peace here . Mauser , you have to get her back . I don 't have that technology . But if you can get your hands on that weapon I may find a way to bring Cleo back to our own plane of existence . I don 't think Raina 's gonna let us borrow her new toy . You don 't borrow toys , you take them . Storming that lab is tactical suicide , Sarge . You know we never leave a team member behind . You 're right . We do this one for Cleo . Oh , my God . You guys . Uh-uh . A little late for that . You should 've killed me while you had me in the chair . Don 't put the blame on me , Doc . You created this technology . It 's your own guilt you feel . Horrible , crushing guilt . You 've unleashed a monster , and you just can 't live with yourself . Hel , can you hear me ? You must stop what you 're doing . Voice ? Raina has reversed the image of Sarge in your mind with her own . You 're aiming at Sarge . Hel , what are you doing ? I 'm getting orders from Voice . That 's Raina you 're hearing , not Voice . This is a mission-critical order , Hel . Fire the weapon before she takes more - Oh . Sorry . Did I break your concentration ? I promise I 'll be quiet . " The wheels on the bus go round and round " " round and round , round and round " This is the Voice , Hel . I 'm giving you a direct order . " The wipers on the bus go swish , swish , swish " " swish , swish , swish , swish , swish , swish " # Hel , I 'm using your gauntlet to adjust the weapon 's quantum phase variants to reopen the Psionic plane . Another blast from the weapon should draw Cleo 's molecular structure back to our own plane of existence . Mauser , what ? Shoot Cleo . Cleo , if you can hear me , get Raina to shoot you . It 's your only chance ! Right here . Here , here . Shoot me . Don 't go anywhere , Doc . Oh . All this time dodging lasers , and now I can 't get shot to save my life . Oh . Gutsy move , coming in here . Gutsy , but stupid . Oh , yeah ! Yeah . Good right hook . Thanks . Great to have you back , Cleo . It 's good to be back . But it was pretty interesting hearing you guys when you thought I was dead . Oh ? Who 's Carla and Dev ? Oh , we 'll talk about that later . Cleo , we need you for a critical mission . Okay . Now that Raina 's all safely tucked away in detention we were hoping that you 'd teach us your card game . Oh ... You bet . All right , the game is called Mississippi Panty Twist . The wild cards are One-Eyed Jacks and the Man with the Axe . Mauser , remember how to deal ? I 'll do my best . Right . Okay ! All right . The first rule is , the player to the dealer 's right decides who gets what cards . So , uh , Mauser , nine . Pretty good . Jack . Oh , oh . Ace . I - I get the aces , by the way . Y - Yeah . Nine ... Subitles subXpacio and TusSeries

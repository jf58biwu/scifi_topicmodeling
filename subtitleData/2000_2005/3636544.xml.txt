 five zero . Ignition . one ! wait ! Please ! and I 'm a highly trained professional astronaut . Uncle Phil will launch another rocket Just as soon as he completes his fuel intake . darlin ' . it takes six months just to reach Mars . you know ? um this bein ' my last night on Earth and everything precious memory for me . Nice try . get that thing out of your nose . But I like it . Don 't you talk back to Mommy . There you are . Woody . Yeah ? Our Mars One crew won 't be heading back to Earth Till ten days af ter you guys land at our base camp with Mars Two . Renee . don 't you think ? Sergei ? I think maybe you should bring a baseball bat . please . We could have ourselves a little solar system series . Half you guys are foreigners . because we have equal crews . one woman . Same handicap . Easy now . That 's my wife you 're talking about And Terri just happens to be one hell of a short stop . batter calls his own strikes . winner take all . Good . You bring the balls . You know the best thing about our mission ? so for the first time in our marriage honey ? sir With a little salute helps . I like it . It 's good . sir . I 'm not sure how I feel about NASA allowing couples To go on this ty pe of mission together . Terri . I mean uh It 's a funny feelin ' for those of us staying ' behind . but you know that all the research shows that marriage will provide Stability on these long duration trips . Then they haven 't studied some of the couples I 've known . baby . He 's not comin ' . Jim deserves this too . All of his friends are here . I know . It 's my last night here . Hey ! It 's your last night with us too . baby . Mm hmm . Deb . I love you too . Maybe you should spend some time with Bobby . where is he ? Up in his fort . Oh . Okay . Millions of miles away . Deep space . so cold . Nick . knock . Bobby ? Your friends are out there playin ' . What are you doin ' up here ? Who 's gonna read to me now at bed time ? Your mother will . But I like when you do it . Now we 're never gonna finish our book . Bobby . okay ? And what I figured out was How about if I bring along my own copy ? And then every night wherever I am I 'll read a little bit more of it . you can read a little bit more of it wherever you are . And it 'll be kind of like we 're reading it together . but I 'm kind ofanxious to find out how old Ben Gunn got marooned on that island . You think that 's a good idea ? Yeah . Yeah ? Yeah . Yeah ? Yeah . Okay . we were afraid you wouldn 't come . I caught a whiff of your barbecue . Oh . Af ter that Yeah ? helpless . All the way out in Galveston ? Somethin ' like that . Mmm ! Deb . I didn 't want to spoil it . Spoil it ? He has been going crazy lookin ' for you . Don 't ever do that to me again . How ya doin ' ? Hey . I 'm doin ' good . man . you know that ? Yeah . Come on . Let 's go in . You remember him ? Come on . Why don 't you just let that go ? As soon as you ad mit that it was a no go situation . It was a go situation . you 're gonna land the ship anyway ? Just because you keep bringing it up doesn 't make you right . settle it . don 't . Don 't look at me . Settle it . this is exactly what I 'm talkin ' about . It 's hard to ad mit . I know that . Come on . Three commanders . One ship . I don 't think that 's gonna work . There 's not enough rocket fuel in the world to get those egos off the ground . we would have made a great crew . Maybe . If this man was lef t seat . Yep . come on . I 'm a I 'm a pretty good stick jockey . You call me if you need a flight test . What is a What is a stick jockey ? Mr. Cover of Time Magazine . The guy who landed a crippled Blockll shuttle . Yeah . That 's the stick jockey . The stick jockey did that ? all right . but putting the first foot prints on Mars ? That 's for guys who wrote their Ph.D. thesis on how to colonize the place And for guys who read too much science fiction as a kid And still wear these little Flash Gordon rocket ships around their necks . Yeah . you read every damn science fiction book I did . And you 're just not man enough to wear jewellery . That 's all there is to that . no . Yeah . Take it . Get it . no ! Maggie would have loved to see you two clowns just one more time . I 'm gonna go and get a beer . Woodrow . I think it 's about time you donated this baby to the museum . boys . Accept no substitutes . listen . um all right ? I 'm okay . I 'm okay . Really . All right . Thanks . Luke . Yep . all right ? Leave a little somethin ' for the next guys . I 'm not promising ' anything . You just bring some expensive beer . All right . buddy . Jim . Yours and Maggie 's . not even Woody . hoping for this assignment . that 's That 's all over now . if you hadn 't pulled yourself you Jim . Wait a minute . I want to say this . all right ? Jim . I would give all of this up in a second if it would bring Maggie back to us . I know that . all the years of training and planning for this mission have been a privilege . Mars is yours now . Go get it . I will . Jim . buddy . Okay . I 'll see you when I get back . Luke . Have a great ride . Always do . Renee . and we we think you 're gonna want to see this for yourself . copy that . it 's too smooth . too angular . Volcanic upwelling maybe . but maybe not volcanic . look at the colour and how shiny it is . That almost looks like It looks like ice . This far south ? Impossible . You can 't have ice at this latitude . not unless there 's like a northeast . Chief . we 're gonna send a packet to Micker . We 're going out there . Keep working . Okay . sir . picture . please . Let 's have a picture . Say cheese . This is a truly anomalous formation . It 's unlike anything everseen so far . the structure appears to be crystalline at least from the angle that 's displayed by ARES 8 . but we think there 's a good chance that this could be an extrusion from some sub surfiace geothermal column of water . if that 's correct then we may have found the key to permanent human colonization . We thinkit wise to suspend judgement here until we take oursamples Let geology and hydrology know full court press . So we 're gonna headout there ASAP and take a lookat this thing try andget an idea of its composition . we should just about be on site . Anybody else hearing that ? Yeah . What is it ? interference from the rover . I can fix anything . Love that modesty . Break out the radar . Let 's see what this thing 's made of . there 's one more thing . very special day for a good friend of ours back home . We know he 's there right now . so I 'm not gonna mention his name . 'Cause the last thing I would want to do would be to embarrass someone like Jim McConnell ! it 's done now . it can 't be right . It says there 's metal under there . Solid metal . Renee . it It says it 's under the whole mountain . and we 're gonna try it again . Hey ! Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you I want you to take a look at Jim . is he all red with one of those fake I 'm a good sport " grins on his face ? take take a look at Ray . Does he have one of those " This wasn 't in my mission plan " looks on his face ? Yeah . Ray . We 're a hundred million miles away ! let 's blow it out . let 's crank up the juice see what 's in this sucker . What happened ? my God ! Sergei ? Uh huh . my God ! Renee ! Jesus ! manual over ride fail . Solution ? Replace optical relay . who dreams up these nightmares ? Don 't try to change the subject . I 'm not . we 're talking about dancing lessons before my sister 's wedding . This is a nightmare . Do you mind ? I 'm in the middle of a catastrophic power failure here . Check . Not effective . Not effective ? Replace optical relay . You 're distracting me . we 're a married couple . Would it kill you to invite me out on the dance floor just once in a while ? Woody . That 's you shuffling your feet around while you grab my butt . you know ? jitterbug . face it . Some couples dance . Some go to Mars . That 's life . Test . I 'm serious . we 're starting lessons . people are gonna think there 's something wrong . they 'll know there 's something wrong . This is highly unprofessional . sir . You keep forgetting that " sir . " Sir . this is Control . this is Cockpit . it 's Phil . They want us all to report to Micker ASAP . Who says to report to Micker ? The little men who live in my head . Phil . We 're in the middle ofa catastrophic power failure right now . it was Ray Beck . He told me to round up the team . Now . The exact same moment that we lost the data stream they picked up this intense burst of energy from Mars . What do you mean intense ? Catastrophic . What about the crew ? The level of energy in the pulse didn 't seem survivable . How about the REMO ? It went into Mars ' orbit last week . Maybe it could give us some clue . That 's just what we tried next . resupply module checked out fine . but there was something else . The REMO 's computer contained an uplink message highly distorted transmission from Mars One base camp . yes . Put up the message . but we 've got a long way to go . Show us whatever you 've got . Show us . I have to make this make this fast . I may not get another chance to to make another chance chance to the site site . There was a low sound that a low sound sound a low sound and it hit us . And it hit us it hit us . my God ! They 're dead . God ! Nick Man ! They 're dead . That 's it . I don 't know . Luke must be in pretty bad shape if he hasn 't just blasted out of there in the Earth Return Vehicle . That thing 's designed so even one crew member can fly it back to Earth . he couldn 't get home . An energy pulse of that magnitude would have fried the ERV 's computers . how do we think the ERV fared ? our modelling says it should be in pretty good shape . Which means it 's gonna be up to us to get new motherboards drives and software to Mars as fast as we can . Right . Slow it down . Slow it down . Slow it down . It 's gonna take us weeks just to analyse this data . we gotta be workin ' up a mission plan . Luke needs us now . Luke may already be dead . it 's doubt ful he is going to be able to transmit again . So we wouldn 't know whether it 's safe to land until we were almost there . What about SIMA ? What about SIMA ? The Saturn imaging probe ? It 's gonna slingshot around Mars on its way through the solar system . read radiation levels of Mars One base camp . wait . We are getting ahead of ourselves . You are forgetting the bigger problem . The orbits are all wrong . Our first decent launch window is almost eight months from now . but we can go earlier and get there faster if we reconfigure the payload for extra fuel . Ray . I 've modelled it . but those stresses have never been tested in space . ship can take it . I wasn 't thinking of just the ship . I know the protocols for a Mars recovery mission better than anybody because I designed them . these guys can do it . Ray . We got a real shot here . give me an updated mission plan by 0800 tomorrow . You 'll have it by 0600 . Let 's go to work . go ahead . I no longer have the right crew . How do you mean ? Bjornstrom can be up here on the next shuttle . but not for this . My people just lost eight months of training . This is a different mission with a different objective . but when you do it ought to be given its best chance for success . I want McConnell to fly right seat . Oh . Jim McConnell is no longer on mission status . because you washed him out . He washed himself out . He only had to pass a few more psych evaluations but he refused to take them . His wife was dead . He didn 't want to lay on a couch and share it with strangers . but I had to make one too ! but I 'd do it again ! she wasted away in front of his eyes . suck it up ? Get with the programme ? What was his crime ? That he That he showed a little emotion ? I couldn 't trust him ! it knocked the hell out of him . It knocked the hell out of all of us . But you know and I know he 's still the best we got . He and Maggie wrote the book on Mars . He 's had more hours in the sims than the rest of us put together . Ray . and we will bring Luke home . It 's a promise . Hey . What 's that ? That is the exact genetic composition of my ideal woman . hey . Hey ! My baby . Now what is it ? A frog ? Skip . Hey . Take a look . Damn . What do you make of that ? Dust storm . comin ' from the east . It 's a big fella too . Headed straight for Mars One base camp . Yep . Could get a little hairy right about landing time . Yeah . maybe even advance our ETA . These bad boys can cover a whole planet and last up to a year . 0600 . That 's when we find out whether we 've come all this way for nothin ' . My money 's on Luke . Have you seen her so fine and pretty Fooled me with her style and ease Andl feel her from across the room it 's love in the third degree baby Won 't ya turn your head my way baby take a chance You 're old enough to Dance The night away Whoa Dance the night away barely a beginner But just watch that lady go She 's on fire ' cause dancing ' gets her higher Than anything elses he knows baby Won 't ya turn your head my way baby please report to the promenade deck . Dance the night away Whoa Dance the night away Oh yeah brought this on ? my friend . My last chance to be graceful . it 's back to shuffle in ' my feet and grabbing ' her butt . Dance the night away baby dance the night away dance The night away Incoming packet . baby Incoming packet . Dance It 's SIMA . Enhanced look at base camp . though . there 's the greenhouse . we know Luke survived for at least a few hours . are there any signs of recent activity ? There . Scan north eastern quadrant of base camp . What the hell are those ? Graves . Wait a minute . There 's only three of them . no . It just means there was no one left to bury him . Check the radiation levels . Check rad levels . Normal . Go to disaster site . Go to 41by 9 . What 's wrong ? I don 't know . Magnetic interference ? Go infrared . Switch to infrared . It 's gotta be a problem with SIMA . I don 't see how an earth quake six months ago could cause this kind of distortion . That was no quake . We are going to continue analysing this data and try to determine what the problem is with those images . uh inconclusive and that a ground search is advisable . but we 'll keep on it . Beware there are little sand storms kicking up Bureau babble. near Mars One base . But the big one you spotted is turning south . It shouldn 't be a factor . We are pretty excited around here . and we are sure you must be feeling the same . Enjoy your meal and get a good night 's sleep . Say it . We anticipate Say it . that tomorrow morning Say it . you will be gone . Yes ! Yes ! Thank you ! Thank you ! Hooray for baby Jimmy ! Jim ' s first space ship was seriously under powered . Maggie was always a little star struck . Come on . Show us those beautiful teeth . I am gonna get you guys for that ! I am gonna get you . it was love at first flight . Woody 's line . Woody 's line . Oh . things got a little tough . Maggie always did keep Jim on a short leash . Jim was always trying to explore a heavenly body . yes . where are they goin ' ? Where are they goin ' ? Ten thousand mile high club . That 's right . Until Mission accomplished . Oh ! what a fun wedding . I was so whacked . T-minus two contact . we can stop it there . Stop there . Fast forward . Allright . And then what happened ? I I know what happened . you guys . They 're adding a wonderfiul chapter to their incredible story and it 's a pretty historic one . Jim and Maggie ! hear . I will drink to that . Thank you . Thank you . Hold it . It 's not over . Show ' em . Show ' em . Show ' em . this is good . guys . Here we go . It 's Phil 's best work . yeah . Look ! It 's Mars ! You can pick up these post cards at your local NASA souvenir shop . it will prove once and for all that there really is no intelligent life on Mars . enough . Thanks a lot . Touche . You 're gonna eat those words . I don 't think so . here we go . Let me take it away . What ? What if I 'm right ? Here we go . What if she 's right ? Why does it have to be about us ? You okay ? Why can 't it just be about science ? Yes . and we 'll do it really well Yeah . because that 's what we 've trained for . But what if there 's more ? ln all our myths Mars has always held a special attraction . what if that means something ? The universe is is not chaos . It 's connection . Life reaches out for life . isn 't it ? To stand on a new world and look beyond it to the next one . It 's who we are . she may have been right . then something else caused it or planned it . You thinkin ' the same thing ? It 's never been out of my mind . Woody . She was the only one of us who ever really believed there might be something down there . we 're not leaving until we find out . Deal ? Deal . Range : 67 83 and closing . 65 minutes until Mars orbital capture . let 's look sharp now .

Jesus . She 's not where I thought she 'd be . We 're gonna miss her . What do you think ? We can 't catch it . Not like this . maybe two shots before she 's out of reach . we got nothing . I 'll leave you the gun . Run a line out to the REMO . I got enough fuel lef t for that . You 'll be going too fast . I 'll aim to overshoot . Brake like hell and arc it in . Piece of cake .

I am not retrievable . honey . not travel . it 's gotta work . listen . I don 't like it any more than you do . Jim . I am . Woody . drop her down and come scoop you up . Jim . It 's gonna take us halfan hour to get the REMO reoriented . Woody will be in the atmosphere by then . Then we 'll just have to get her moving faster . We don 't have time . honey . It 's a good plan . No . We 're gonna come get you . now . On my mark . Three You can do it . two You can do it ! one . Come on ! Mark ! Come on ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Jim . Way to go . Way to go . Good job . All right . There won 't be enough room for us inside . let 's start dumping the cargo . Woody . Jim . beautiful . Come on . All right . It 's open . no ! Terri ! Come back ! You 'll never make it ! Woody . I 'm not gonna watch you die . Terri . You 'd do the same for me . dump the cargo and start the systems . Now ! I wouldn 't . Not if it was impossible . I can do it ! you can 't . You don 't have enough fuel to come get me and get us back . and you have to stop now . Terri . It 's no use . honey . You gotta go back now . The hell I do . What are you doing ? I 'm gonna jet in a little closer and try again . you won 't get back . they 'll die too . please . Please go back . Go back and help the others to the surface . I am not losing you ! I can 't let you do it . I can 't let you die . I 'm sorry . Woody . What are you doing ? honey . Woody No . No ! how I love you . Woody ! Don 't ! Woody ! Woody ! Woody ! Don 't ! No ! no ! Woody . Woody . Terri . He 's gone . No . No . Terri . No . We need you . Woody . No . No . No . No . No . Terri . Come back . Ray . We 've got some new data just coming in . We just It doesn 't make any sense . We 're not sure how to read this . Data ? Yes . Telemetry reports the REMO left its orbit and reached the Martian surface . sir . Under power . What ? Sixty three minutes after Mars Recovery went off line . the graph shows a controlled descent but that doesn 't make any sense . They used the REMO as a lander . It 's It 's Jim McConnell . It 's got to be . Nobody else could have pulled this off . Nobody else . Son of a bitch . I 've got access to the ERV . I 'm gonna go inside . is the oxygen generator okay ? though . I 'm entering the hab . There 's still oxygen in here . This is a little spooky . I don 't like the dark at all . Need some lights . Need some lights . Okay . Where are we ? Here we go . ERV appears to be structurally intact . the computers are fried . Copy that . I got busted filters here . Clogged intakes . but so far no major damage . I 'm in the greenhouse . Jim ? It 's working . I 'll be damned . Luke . No ! You 're not here ! You are not here ! Your wife is Debra . Your son is Bobby . No ! You 're reading Treasure Island with him . Luke It 's all right . It 's me . Jim ? Yeah . wait ! He 's all right . He 's all right . Phil ? Phil . Terri . what are you what are you What are you doing here ? You 're not supposed to be You 're not supposed to be here . How are you here ? How are you here ? This is a rescue mission . Woody wanted me right seat . I can 't I can 't believe where is he ? Where 's Woody ? He didn 't make it . God . Oh . Oh . no . no . you know ? I give them and they give me oxygen and food . you know ? really except not as many not as many fights . some fights . Luke . Tell us what happened here . I We fired the radar and they all died . They all They all died . Wh What do you mean ? What What came ? The force came out of the top of the mountain and and and but I was spared . Why ? Why ? Had to be for a reason . I knew the reason why . It 's so someone would be left to figure out the secret . You know ? It 's come . or is he a few meal packs short of a picnic ? Long term exposure to low gravity can have an adverse impact on the brain . he could be suffering from some form of asphyxia . and he 's been marooned alone on Mars for a year . It 's a miracle he 's survived this long . I 'd better bring him up to speed . great . So let me be sure I understand this . Your ship blew up with all its supplies . Then you Then you emptied all the cargo out of the REMO and it was totalled on landing . no spare oxygen . Nothing other than what I 'm looking at right here . Jim ? That kind . Check it out . New nav boards for the ERV . right in here . thank God . my face plate was cracked . It was leaking . Leaking badly . I barely made it back to base . It was weeks before I could work up the nerve to go back out there and look for and look for their bodies . but it just didn 't seem right somehow to just dig one grave . God . Has it been blowing like this for a while ? Yeah . but Micker said it was turning south . If it holds course . this this whatever it was . This This force . You said it came directly out of the top of the mountain ? Don 't you believe me ? but I 'm not crazy . I know that much . I 'm not crazy . What 'd you mean by its " secret " ? What secret ? okay ? meteor impacts . the whole surface of the planet would have changed . So it 's no wonder we never saw it before . but not like they meant us to . Luke ? Saw this . Jesus . what are you trying to tell us ? You 're trying to tell us that that 's a face ? That 's the face . It 's the face . It 's real . and it 's not us . Jim It 's not possible . Jesus . Look at that . My God . I know . what what about that sound you heard before the explosion ? Jim . Th Th That 's the key . That 's the key . You hear that ? Yeah . It 's pauses . Do you hear the pauses ? Yeah . that 's what made me realize it 's a pattern . It 's a repeating pattern . Mathematical ? Mm hmm . That occurred to me too . There are distinct blocks within each pattern the tones come in groups of three . three . It 's always the same . you know and then I thought about dimensions . X Y Z coordinates . Exactly . Three groups equals three dimensions . So I I assigned different graphic values to each block group and tone and I came up with this . my God . Is that what I think it is ? DNA ? You see it ? Yeah . It 's a model of DNA . So So somebody left that thing here . Okay . Somebody other than human . what is it ? It 's a signature . It 's a self portrait of whatever species created the face . that DNA looks human . it 's not . It 's missing the last pair of chromosomes . See ? This is close . It 's damn close . " Close " ? The difference between man and ape is less than three percent genetic material . Mozart . Jack the Ripper . he 's right . topical medications one complete med pack . With eight tubes of anti fungal cream . at least we won 't rash to death . Luke . How do you feel ? Lighter . A lot lighter . man . The backup generator is salvageable . So are two of the solar panels . I 'm pretty sure I can get the oxygen still back into production . considering . Terri . Good work . Jesus . Look at this . Phil 's idea of absolute essentials . Of course . hey . Hey ! My baby . It 's not a signature . What ? The noise from the face . It 's not a signature . It 's a test . It 's asking us for the right answer . It wants us to put in the missing pair of chromosomes . Why ? To prove that we 're human . and you 're saying Which it interpreted as the wrong answer . It 's It could be like a security alarm . it defends itself . So what happens when it gets the right answer ? Phil . But we gotta find out . what if we work this the other way ? We figure out which tones would be equivalent to the missing chromosomes and then dub them into your recording of the signal . Is that possible ? Yeah . good . What about the radar gun ? Will it accept the input so we can transmit a completed signal back to the face ? Jim . What if you 're wrong ? Whoever goes out there what if you 're wrong ? Three people have already died over that thing . Four . Terri . they all died in vain . We don 't We don 't have to go out there . Got a lot of static here . Something 's interfering . Yeah . The antenna got knocked around pretty badly in the blast . This is the best resolution I think we 're gonna be able to get . guys . I got the nav boards . I 'm sealing the airlock . Check the video feed . Video feed looks good . How close do we have to get ? I 'm not sure . Maybe I 'll stop it right over there by that rock . Do it . Good . Okay . Here we go . Jim . it worked . I don 't know what the hell we just did but does that look to you like a hostile gesture ? No . More like an invitation . Or another test . Check for radiation . Normal . Seismic : Normal .

 four , three , two , one , zero . Ignition . Ten , nine , eight , seven , six , fiive , four , three , two , one ! - Blast off ! - Guys , guys , please , wait ! Please ! This is very risky stuff here , and I 'm a highly trained professional astronaut . - Here you go . - Now , Uncle Phil will launch another rocket ... just as soon as he completes his fuel intake . Thanks , darlin ' . Now , you know , it takes six monthsjust to reach Mars . Then a year on the surface , six months back . It 's , like , two years , you know ? Anyway , guess what I 'm tryin to say here is that , um ... you know , this bein ' my last night on Earth and everything ... this could be a very , uh , precious memory for me . Nice try . - William , get that thing out ofyour nose . - But I like it . - Don 't you talk back to Mommy . - There you are . - Hey , Woody . - Yeah ? Our Mars One crew won 't be heading back to Earth ... till ten days afteryou guys land at our base camp with Mars Two . - Uh-huh . - Oh , thankyou , Renee . That 's a pretty good long rendezvous , don 't you think ? - What are you suggesting , Sergei ? - I think maybe you should bring a baseball bat . - Yes , we will play American baseball on Mars , our two crews . - Oh , please . - We could have ourselves a little solar system series . - Halfyou guys are foreigners . - We 'd crush you . - No , no , no , because we have equal crews . We have three men , one woman . Same handicap . Easy now . That 's my wife you 're talking about ... and Terri just happens to be one hell ofa shortstop . Fast pitch , no steals , batter calls his own strikes . - Thousand bucks make it interesting ? - Oh , winner take all . Good . You bring the balls . You know the best thing about our mission ? On Mars Two , technically , I outrank her , so for the fii rst time in our marriage ... she 's gonna have to do everything I say , right , honey ? - Yes , honey . - Yes , honey , sir ... with a little salute helps . - Yes , honey , sir . - Yeah , I like it . It 's good . - Take that corn up there , all right ? - Yes , sir . I 'm not sure how I feel about NASA allowing couples ... to go on this type of mission together . Well , nothin ' personal , Terri . I mean- - It- - It 'sjust that it 's , uh- - It 's a funny feelin for those of us staying ' behind . Yes , but you know that all the research shows that marriage will provide ... stability on these long duration trips . Then they haven 't studied some ofthe couples I 've known . Luke . Come on , baby . He 's not comin ' . This isn 't right . I mean , Jim deserves this too . - All of his friends are here . - I know . - It 's my last night here . - Hey ! It 's your last night with us too . - I know . I 'm sorry , baby . - Mm-hmm . - I love you , Deb . - I love you too . Maybe you should spend some time with Bobby . - Yeah , where is he ? - Up in his fort . - Oh . Okay . - Millions of miles away . Deep space . So lonesome , so cold . So lame , Nick . Knock , knock . Bobby ? Your friends are out there playin ' . What are you doin ' up here ? Who 's gonna read to me now at bedtime ? Your mother will . But I like when you do it . - Now we 're never gonna fii nish our book . - Bobby . Listen , I 've been thinkin about that too , okay ? And what I fii gured out was- - How about if I bring along my own copy ? And then every night wherever I am I 'll read a little bit more of it . And you and Mommy , you can read a little bit more of it whereveryou are . And it 'll be kind of like we 're reading it together . 'Cause , hey , I don 't know about you , but I 'm kind ofanxious ... to fii nd out how old Ben Gunn got marooned on that island . - You think that 's a good idea ? - Yeah . - Yeah ? - Yeah . - Yeah ? - Yeah . Okay . Well , we were afraid you wouldn 't come . - I caught a whiff ofyour barbecue . - Oh . - After that- - - Yeah ? I was , uh , helpless . All the way out in Galveston ? - Somethin ' like that . - Mmm ! It 's his night , Deb . I didn 't want to spoil it . Spoil it ? He has been going crazy lookin ' foryou . Don 't ever do that to me again . - How ya doin ' ? - Hey . I 'm doin ' good . - Here . - Thanks , man . A lot of people are gonna be mighty glad to see ya , you know that ? - Yeah . - Come on . Let 's go in . You remember him ? - Come on . - Why don 't you just let that go ? - As soon as you admit that it was a no-go situation . - It was a go situation . Three months , no data stream , you 're gonna land the ship anyway ? Just because you keep bringing it up doesn 't make you right . Just because you get loud doesn 't make--Jim , settle it . - No , no , don 't- - Don 't look at me . - Settle it . - It 's a go situation . - Well , th- - this is exactly what I 'm talkin ' about . - It 's hard to admit . I know that . - Come on . Three commanders . One ship . I don 't think that 's gonna work . There 's not enough rocket fuel in the world to get those egos off the ground . - Come on . - Ah , we would have made a great crew . - Maybe . Ifthis man was left seat . - Yep . Guys , come on . I 'm a- - I 'm a pretty good stickjockey . - You call me ifyou need a flight test . - What is a- - What is a stickjockey ? - " l 'm a pretty good stickjockey . " - Come on , Mr Cover of Time Magazine . The guy who landed a crippled Blockll shuttle . - Yeah . That 's the stickjockey . - The stickjockey did that ? - Yeah , yeah , Mr StickJockey . - Okay , all right . I made a little noise , but putting the fii rst footprints on Mars ? That 's for guys who wrote their Ph.D. thesis on how to colonize the place ... and for guys who read too much science fiiction as a kid ... - and still wear these little Flash Gordon rocket ships around their necks . - Yeah . - Very , very mature . - Yeah , you read every damn science fiiction book I did . And you 'rejust not man enough to wear jewellery . That 's all there is to that . - Give me it . - No , no , no . - Yeah . Take it . Get it . You know you want Flash here . You ain 't gettin ' him ! Oh , no ! Yeah , Maggie would have loved to see you two clownsjust one more time . I 'm gonna go and get a beer . I don 't know , Woodrow . I think it 's about time you donated this baby to the museum . Internal combustion , boys . Accept no substitutes . Jim , listen . Ifthere 's , um- - - Ifthere 's anything that Terri and I can do , you call us , all right ? - I 'm okay . I 'm okay . Really . - All right . - Thanks . - Luke . - Yep . I 'll see you when I get to Mars . Listen . Don 't solve all the mysteries ofthe universe , all right ? - Leave a little somethin' for the next guys . - I 'm not promising ' anything . - You just bring some expensive beer . - All right . - Will do . Godspeed . - Thanks , buddy . It should have been your mission , Jim . Yours and Maggie 's . Nobody ever wanted Mars the way you two did , not even Woody . You two were 1 2 years training for this thing , hoping for this assignment . - It 's- - - Well , that 's- - That 's all over now . If Maggie hadn 't gotten sick , ifyou hadn 't pulled yourself ... out ofthe rotation to take care of her , I mean , you- - - Luke . Come on . - No , Jim . Wait a minute . I want to say this . Look , I wanted this assignment , all right ? But not like this , Jim . I would give all ofthis up in a second if it would bring Maggie back to us . I know that . Look , all the years oftraining and planning for this mission have been a privilege . Mars is yours now . Go get it . I will . You take care ofyourself , Jim . You too , buddy . Okay . I 'll see you when I get back . Hey , Luke . Have a great ride . Always do . - Luke , doyou readme ? - Yeah , Renee . Luke , ljustgotARES-8 on-line , and- - Well , we- - we thinkyou 're gonna want to see this foryourself . Okay , copy that . - Now , is this a cinder cone ? - No , it 's too smooth . It 's , uh , too angular . Volcanic upwelling maybe . - No , no fiissure , no caldera . - No , it 's an upwelling for sure , but maybe not volcanic . I mean , look at the colour and how shiny it is . That almost looks like- - - It looks like ice . - This far south ? Impossible . You can 't have ice at this latitude . I mean , not unless there 's like a- - - Okay , how far away is that ? - Sixteen kilometres , northeast . Take us 20 minutes to get there , Chief . Okay , we 're gonna send a packet to Micker . We 're going out there . - Keep working . - Okay . - Careful . Watch your step . - Yes , sir . - Is it possible to take picture ? - Oh , picture . - Come , please . - Let 's have a picture . Say cheese . This is a truly anomalous formation . It 's unlike anything everseen so far . Thestructure appears to be crystalline ... at least from the angle that 's displayedbyARES-8 . Now , we 're trying not togo too nuts up here , but we think there 's agoodchance ... that this couldbe an extrusion from somesubsurfiace geothermalcolumn ofwater . And , ofcourse , ifthat 's correct ... then we may have foundthe key topermanent human colonization . - We thinkit wise to suspendjudgement here until we take oursamples ... - Let geology and hydrology know ... - anddo a thorough investigation ofthe area . - we need to scramble on this , full-court press . So we 're gonna headout thereASAP andtake a lookat this thing ... tryandget an idea ofits composition . By the timeyou receive this , we shouldjust about be on site . Anybody else hearing that ? Yeah . What is it ? I don 't know . It sounds like , uh , interference from the rover . - Can you flix it ? - Hey , Skip , I can flix anything . Love that modesty . Break out the radar . Let 's see what this thing 's made of . Oh , yes , there 's one more thing . Now , this is a veryimportant , veryspecialday foragoodfriend ofours backhome . We knowhe 's there right now . Nowhe hates it when anybody makes any kindofa fuss about him , so I 'm notgonna mention his name . 'Cause the last thing I would want to do wouldbe to embarrass someone likeJim McConnell ! Was that loud ? Oh , well , it 's done now . I mean , it can 't be right . It says there 's metal under there . Solid metal . No , that doesn 't make any sense . You 're reading a vein ofore , Renee . No , it- - It says it 's under the whole mountain . All right . Move it closer , up the power , and we 're gonna try it again . - Hey ! - Happy birthday toyou Happy birthday toyou Okay , everybody , I wantyou to take a lookatJim . - Happy birthday , dearJim - Now , is he allred with one ofthose fake ... " Oh , I 'm-a-good-sport " grins on his face ? - Happy birthday toyou - That 's right . Now , everybody , take- - take a lookat Ray . Does he have one ofthose " This-wasn ' t-in-my-mission-plan " looks on his face ? Yeah . Uh-huh . Thoughtso . Well , there 's nothingyou can do about it , Ray . We 're a hundredmillion miles away ! Okay , let 's blowit out . - We 're all set here , Chief . - All right , let 's crank up thejuice ... see what 's in this sucker . What happened ? Oh , my God ! - You gettin ' that , Sergei ? - Uh-huh . Oh , my God ! Renee ! Oh ! Oh , my God ! Oh , Jesus ! Oh , Jesus ! Problem : hatch door malfunction , backup power fail , manual override fail . - Solution ? - Replace optical relay . Piece ofcake . God , who dreams up these nightmares ? - Don 't try to change the subject . - I 'm not . - We 're talking about your sister 's wedding , right ? - No , we 're talking about ... - dancing lessons before my sister 's wedding . - This is a nightmare . Do you mind ? I 'm in the middle ofa catastrophic power failure here . Check . - Not effective . - Not effective ? - Replace optical relay . - You 're distracting me . Woody , we 're a married couple . Would it kill you to invite me out on the dance floorjust once in a while ? - We danced . We danced at our wedding . We danced . - No . That 's not dancing , Woody . That 's you shuffl ing your feet around while you grab my butt . I 'm talking about real dancing , you know ? Cha-cha-cha , rhumba , jitterbug . Darling , face it . Some couples dance . Some go to Mars . That 's life . Test . Effective . Yeah . Woody , I 'm serious . Just as soon as we get back home , we 're starting lessons . - Uh-huh . - Woody , ifwe never dance , people are gonna think there 's something wrong . Ifthey see me dance , they 'll know there 's something wrong . This is highly unprofessional . - This is highly unprofessional , sir . You keep forgetting that " sir . " - Sir . Cockpit , this is Control . - Cockpit , this is Control . - Control , this is Cockpit . Yeah , Terri , it 's Phil . They want us all to report to Micker ASAP . - Who says to report to Micker ? - The little men who live in my head . Well , that 's a negative , Phil . We 're in the middle ofa catastrophic power failure right now . Yeah , Woody , it was Ray Beck . He told me to round up the team . Now . The exact same moment that we lost the data stream ... they picked up this intense burst ofenergy from Mars . - What do you mean intense ? - Catastrophic . What about the crew ? The level ofenergy in the pulse didn 't seem survivable . How about the REMO ? It went into Mars ' orbit last week . Maybe it could give us some clue . That 'sjust what we tried next . All right . The , uh , resupply module checked out fii ne . No instrument failures . Orbit holding steady , but there was something else . The REMO 's computer contained an uplink message- - a very faint , highly distorted transmission from Mars One base camp . - Someone 's alive . - Yes , yes , yes . Put up the message . Still concentrating on the audio , but we 've got a long way to go . Show us whateveryou 've got . Show us . Ihave to make this- - make this fast . Imay notget anotherchance to- - to make- - anotherchance- - chance- - to thesite- - site . There wasa lowsoundthat- - a lowsound- - sound- - a lowsound- - Something came out ofthe top ofthe mountain , andit hit us . And- - it hit us- - it hit us . Oh , my God ! They 're dead . God ! Nick- - Man ! They 're dead . That 's it . I don 't know . Luke must be in pretty bad shape ... if he hasn 'tjust blasted out ofthere in the Earth Return Vehicle . That thing 's designed so even one crew member can fly it back to Earth . Even if Luke was in great shape , he couldn 't get home . An energy pulse ofthat magnitude would have fried the ERV 's computers . Other than the computers , how do we think the ERV fared ? Well , so far , our modelling says it should be in pretty good shape . Which means it 's gonna be up to us to get new motherboards ... drives and software to Mars as fast as we can . - Right . - Slow it down . Slow it down . Slow it down . It 's gonna take us weeks just to analyse this data . Right , right , but in the meantime , we gotta be workin ' up a mission plan . - Luke needs us now . - Luke may already be dead . And even if he 's not , it 's doubtful he is going to be able to transmit again . So we wouldn 't know whether it 's safe to land ... until we were almost there . What about SIMA ? What about SIMA ? The Saturn imaging probe ? It 's gonna slingshot around Mars on its way through the solar system . It could be retasked to take pictures , read radiation levels of Mars One base camp . Wait , wait , wait . We are getting ahead ofourselves . You are forgetting the bigger problem . The orbits are all wrong . Our fii rst decent launch window is almost eight months from now . Yes , but we can go earlier and get there faster ... ifwe reconfii gure the payload for extra fuel . We 've modelled that , Ray . I 've modelled it . On paper , yes , but those stresses have never been tested in space . - The ship can take it . - Oh , " ship can take it . " I wasn 't thinking ofjust the ship . Ray , I know the protocols for a Mars recovery mission better than anybody ... because I designed them . And I 'm telling you , these guys can do it . He 's right , Ray . We got a real shot here . Well , give me an updated mission plan by 0800 tomorrow . You 'll have it by 0600 . Let 's go to work . - Chief , can I have a word ? - Yeah , go ahead . - I no longer have the right crew . - How do you mean ? Bjornstrom can be up here on the next shuttle . Bjornstrom is a geologist . He 's good , but not for this . My peoplejust lost eight months oftraining . This is a different mission with a different objective . - I haven 't approved the mission yet . - Yes , but when you do ... it ought to be given its best chance for success . I want McConnell to fly right seat . Oh . Jim McConnell is no longer on mission status . - Yeah , because you washed him out . - He washed himselfout . He only had to pass a few more psych evaluations ... but he refused to take them . His wife was dead . He didn 't want to lay on a couch and share it with strangers . Yeah , that was his call , but I had to make one too ! It was tough as hell , but I 'd do it again ! For Christ 's sake , Ray , she wasted away in front of his eyes . What was he supposed to do , suck it up ? Get with the programme ? What was his crime ? That he- - That he showed a little emotion ? I couldn 't trust him ! When Maggie died , it knocked the hell out of him . It knocked the hell out ofall of us . But you know and I know he 's still the best we got . He and Maggie wrote the book on Mars . He 's had more hours in the sims than the rest of us put together . We can do this , Ray . You give me McConnell as copilot , and we will bring Luke home . It 's a promise . Hey . What 's that ? That is the exact genetic composition of my ideal woman . Hey , hey , hey . Hey ! My baby . - Now what is it ? - A frog ? - Hey , Skip . - Hey . Take a look . Damn . - What do you make ofthat ? - Dust storm . Southern hemisphere , comin ' from the east . It 's a big fella too . - Headed straight for Mars One base camp . - Yep . Could get a little hairy right about landing time . Yeah . Listen , we 're gonna have to be able to move fast , maybe even advance our ETA . These bad boys can cover a whole planet and last up to a year . - When does SIMA do her fly-by ? - Tomorrow morning , 0600 . That 's when we fii nd out whether we 've come all this way for nothin ' . My money 's on Luke . Haveyouseen her so fine andpretty Fooledme with herstyle andease Andlfeelher from across the room Yes , it 's love in the thirddegree Ooh , baby , baby Won 'tya turnyourheadmy way Ooh , baby , baby Come on , take a chance You 're old enough to Dance The night away Whoa Dance the night away A live wire , barely a beginner Butjust watch that ladygo She 's on fire ' cause dancing ' gets herhigher Than anything elseshe knows Ooh , baby , baby Won 'tya turnyourheadmy way Ooh , baby , baby All those interestedin dance lessons , please report to thepromenade deck .

Once we 're in Mars ' gravity , it 's back to shuffl in ' my feet and grabbing ' her butt . Dance the night away Oh , baby Dance , dance , dance the night away Oh , come on , dance - The night away - Incomingpacket . - Oh , baby - Incomingpacket . - Dance - It 's SIMA . Enhanced look at base camp . - Looks deserted . - It 's still standing , though . So 's the ERV . And , look , there 's the greenhouse . Well , we know Luke survived for at least a few hours . Now , are there any signs of recent activity ? There . Scan northeastern quadrant of base camp . What the hell are those ? - Graves . - Wait a minute . There 's only three ofthem . - That means that Luke 's still gotta be alive . It means he 's still down there . - Phil , no , no . Itjust means there was no one left to bury him . - Check the radiation levels . - Check rad levels . Normal . - Go to disaster site . - Go to 41 by 9 . - What 's wrong ? - I don 't know . Magnetic interference ? - Go infrared . - Switch to infrared . It 's gotta be a problem with SIMA . I don 't see how an earthquake six months ago could cause this kind ofdistortion . That was no quake . We are going to continue analysing this data ... andtryto determine what theproblem is with those images . We agree that the evidence ofthegraves is , uh ... inconclusive ... andthat agroundsearch is advisable . Frankly , we are asstumped asyouguys , but we 'llkeep on it . Beware there are little sandstormskicking up ... - Bureau babble . - near Mars One base . But the big one youspottedis turning south . It shouldn ' t be a factor . We arepretty excitedaroundhere . Well , and we are sure you must be feeling thesame . - Enjoyyourmealand get agoodnight 's sleep . - Say it . - We anticipate ... - Say it . - that tomorrowmorning ... - Say it . you willbego . Yes !

I- - Iknow what happened . - What nerves . - Okay , youguys . They 're adding a wonderfiulchapter to theirincredible story ... andit 's apretty historic one . To the newly appointedco-commanders of Mars One , Jim andMaggie ! - Hear , hear . - I willdrink to that . - Thankyou . - Thankyou . - Holdit . It 's not over . - Show ' em . Show ' em . Show ' em . - Yeah , we got a little- - a little addendum . - Oh , yeah , this isgood . - Check this out , guys . - Here we go . It 's Phil 's best work . - Oh , yeah . - Look ! It 's Mars ! You canpick up thesepostcards atyourlocaINASA souvenirshop . You know , whenyou two landup there , it willprove once andforall ... that there really is no intelligent life on Mars . - Allright . Enough , enough . - Thanks a lot . Touche . - You 're gonna eat those words . - Idon 't thinkso . - Everett , give me the camera . - Allright . - Idon 't thinkso . - Uh-oh , here we go . - Let me take it away . - What ? What ifl 'm right ? - Here we go . - What ifshe 's right ? - Why does it have to be about us ? - You okay ? - Why can 't itjust be aboutscience ? - Yes . - We 'lldo thescience , and we 'lldo it really well ... - Yeah . because that 's what we 've trainedfor . But what ifthere 's more ? ln all ourmyths ... in everyhuman culture , Mars has always helda specialattraction . Imean , what if that meanssomething ? The universe is- - is not chaos . It 's connection . Life reaches out forlife . That 's what we were born for , isn ' t it ? To standon a new world andlookbeyondit to the next one . It 's who we are . You know , she may have been right . Ifthat wasn 't a quake down there , then something else caused it ... or planned it . You thinkin ' the same thing ? It 's never been out of my mind . I think she knew something , Woody . She was the only one of us who ever really believed ... there might be something down there . Yeah , well , we 're not leaving until we fii nd out . Deal ? Deal . Range : 67-83 and closing . 65 minutes until Mars orbital capture . Okay , people , let 's look sharp now . We 're gonna run this simulation one more time . Remember , ifwe overshoot , there 's no comin ' back . Yeah , and drifting through eternity will ruin your whole day . Okay , Delta-V systems initialized . Charge primary APU .

We 're still outgassing in the lower hab . There must be another hole down there . It 's gotta be a big one . Everybody switch to suit oxygen . Jim , you 've got the ship . - I 'm going EVA . - Copy . Come on , people . Let 's work the problem . Eightypercent atmosphere . Jim , you got to go get your spare helmet . Copy that , Jim ? There 's no time . All the systems have crashed . I gotta shut down the hab from below . We 're losing pressure , Jim . You could embolize . Seventypercent atmosphere . Phil , you 've got to get the nav computers back on-line . Uh , Jim , I 've got an idea . Ifyou guys can save enough atmosphere ... I 'll disconnect the power in the main computer bay and jump-start the systems . - I 'd basically be doing a hard boot . - Has that been tested ? Are you kidding ? These machines are way too expensive . - Do it . - Okay . I think this will work . Sixtypercent atmosphere . - Jim , how we doing on the AG ? - Just hang on one second , Woody . - Fiftypercent atmosphere . - Come on . - Come on . - Jim , I 've got oxygen . - Come on . - Voiceprint identification . - Mc- - McCon- - - Not accepted .

Do you know which sector ? - I 'm working on it . - You better get some oxygen , Jim . - Yeah . Yeah , I 'm fine . Come on . Jesus . It 's like lookin ' for a needle in a haystack . Okay , come on . Come on . Where are you , you little bastard ? Give me some light on the hull so I can locate it . I got a better idea . Gotcha . Terri . Squeeze out the liquid . S-Stay there . - Squeeze it out . - Jim . Okay . Okay . Please work . Thirtypercent atmosphere . Woody , the breach is between sectors fiive and six . - Five and six . Do you copy ? - Copy . I 'm headin ' there now . Son ofa bitch . You never did that in a simulator . - Twentypercent atmosphere . - Jim ? - Tenpercent atmosphere . - Jim ! Jim , talk to me .

I have got no attitude control . - Manual separation . Blow the bolts . - Negative . The control module ... doesn 't have enough thrust to correct this rotation . We 're too steep . We 're falling into the atmosphere . Christ , at this angle , we 're gonna burn up . - How much time we got , Phil ? - I don 't know . Three minutes ? I don 't know . - Where 's the REMO ? - The resupply module ? Why ? There 's no way we 're gonna be able to link up . Where is it ? Resupply module located . Resupply module located . - It 's close . - How close ? - I don 't know . That 's gonna take some time . - Figure it out . We don 't have time , Phil . Figure it out now . Jim , we 're dead stick . There 's no way to manoeuvre this ship into linkup . Not the ship.Just us . We go EVA . - You want us to transfer in suits ? - Jesus , Jim , ifwe don 't make it- - - Ifwe miss the REMO- - - There 's no other choice . - Phil , how close ? - Intersection orbit with REMO . Course intersectionplotted . One kilometre . That 's the best I can do . Prepare to abandon ship . Let 's go ! - What are you looking for ? - Earth . Hey , when we get back home , we really will have to try this out in the sim . How we doing on the fuel , Woody ? I 'm at 50 percent . I don 't see the REMO . There it is . Forty-fiive left , forty-fiive down . Oh , Jesus . She 's not where I thought she 'd be . - We 're gonna miss her . - What do you think ? We can 't catch it . Not like this . Use the tether . You 'll have one , maybe two shots before she 's out of reach . Negative . It 's too risky . Ifwe miss her , we got nothing . I 'll leave you the gun . Run a line out to the REMO . I got enough fuel left for that . - You 'll be going too fast . - I 'll aim to overshoot . Brake like hell and arc it in . Piece ofcake . I 'll see you in a flash . Unhook me . Good to go . Okay , I 'm on a path to overshoot . I 'm gonna take the edge off . I 'm out offuel . Coming in hot . Still long . Abandoning the unit . I 'll break with suitjets . Jesus.Jesus. Suitjets gone . I 'm gonna make contact . - What velocity ? - Impact 's gonna be a little rough . - At what velocity ? - Thirty-two . - I 'm gonna use the gun to slow you . - No . - Ifyou slow me , I 'll fall short . - It 's too fast , Woody . No choice . I 'll be okay . Here we go ! Gotcha . Woody ! Woody ! Woody ! Woody ! Woody . Woody . - No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no . - Woody . Woody . - Terri . - Woody . Take the gun . Take it . Phil , hang on . Go . Woody , what 's your status ? Well , uh , my suitjets are gone , and I 'm still carrying a good deal ofvelocity . Soon as we get hooked up , I 'll come get you . - I 'd have to say negative on that , Jim . - Negative on the transmission ? No , I heard you . Negative on the manoeuvre . I am not retrievable . - Woody , you 're not going that fast . - Well , it all comes down to the amount offuel , honey . Suitjets are designed for attitude control , not travel . - Retrieval just won 't work . - Well , it 's gotta work . Hey , listen . I don 't like it any more than you do . - Woody . - Run the numbers , Jim . I am . You hang tight , Woody . We 'll get in the REMO , drop her down and come scoop you up . - Sounds good , Jim . - It 's gonna take us halfan hour to get the REMO reoriented . Woody will be in the atmosphere by then . - Then we 'll just have to get her moving faster . - We don 't have time . Listen toJim , honey . It 's a good plan . No . We 're gonna come get you . - Okay . Get ready for brakes . - Come on , now . - On my mark . Three ... - You can do it . - two ... - You can do it ! - one . - Come on ! - Mark ! - Come on ! Yeah ! Yeah ! - Everybody good ? - We 're on , Jim . Way to go . Way to go . Good job . All right . There won 't be enough room for us inside . Soon as I get the hatch open , let 's start dumping the cargo . - Copy that . - Hang on , Woody . Will do , Jim . Hello , beautiful . Come on . All right . It 's open . - Terri , no ! - Terri ! Come back ! You 'll never make it ! - Terri , what are you doing ? - I 'll tell you what I 'm not doing , Woody . - I 'm not gonna watch you die . - Terri . You 'd do the same for me . Phil , get inside , dump the cargo and start the systems . Now ! - No , I wouldn 't . Not if it was impossible . - I can do it ! No , you can 't . You don 't have enough fuel to come get me and get us back . Listen to me , goddamn it . You have to stop , and you have to stop now . He 's right , Terri . It 's no use . Okay , honey . You gotta go back now . The hell I do . What are you doing ? I 'm gonna jet in a little closer and try again . Terri , you spend any fuel getting closer , you won 't get back . And ifanyone tries to get you , they 'll die too . Honey , please . Please go back . Go back and help the others to the surface . I am not losing you ! I can 't let you do it . - I can 't let you die . I 'm sorry . - Woody . What are you doing ? - Love you , honey . - Woody- - No . No ! - God , how I love you . - Woody ! Don 't ! Woody ! Woody ! Woody ! Don 't ! No ! No ! Please , God , no ! Woody . Woody . Come back , Terri . - He 's gone . - No . No . - Terri . - No . We need you . Woody . No . No . No . No . No . Please , Terri . Come back . Ray . We 've got some new data just coming in . Wejust- - It doesn 't make any sense . We 're not sure how to read this . - Data ? - Yes . Telemetry reports the REMO left its orbit and reached the Martian surface . - Crashed ? - No , sir . Under power . - What ? - Sixty-three minutes after Mars Recovery went off-line . Sir , the graph shows a controlled descent ... but that doesn 't make any sense . They used the REMO as a lander . It 's- - It 'sJim McConnell . It 's got to be . Nobody else could have pulled this off . Nobody else . Son ofa bitch . I 've got access to the ERV . I 'm gonna go inside . Terri , is the oxygengeneratorokay ? Yeah . It 's gonna take a while to get back to 1 00 percent capacity , though . Okay , I 'm entering the hab . There 's still oxygen in here . This is a little spooky . I don 't like the dark at all . Need some lights . Need some lights . Okay . Where are we ? Here we go . ERV appears to be structurally intact . Yeah , butjust as we thought , the computers are fried . Copy that . I got busted fii lters here . Clogged intakes . Hell ofa cleanup job , but so far no major damage . I 'm in the greenhouse . - You gotta see this . - What is it , Jim ? It 's working . I 'll be damned . - Luke . - No ! You 're not here ! You are not here ! Your wife is Debra . Your son is Bobby . - No ! - You 're reading Treasure Island with him . Luke- - It 's all right . It 's me . - Jim ? - Yeah . No , wait ! No ! No , no ! Wait , wait ! He 's all right . He 's all right . Phil ? Phil . Terri . Jim--Jim , what are you- - what are you- - What are you doing here ? You 're not supposed to be- - You 're not supposed to be here . How are you here ? - How are you here ? - This is a rescue mission . Woody wanted me right seat . I can 't- - I can 't believe- - Well , where is he ? Where 's Woody ? He didn 't make it . God . Oh . Oh . Oh , no , no . Oh , God . Oh , no . Well , it works , you know ? I give them ... CO2 and light , and ... they give me oxygen and food . It 's- - It 's actually not a bad arrangement , you know ? It 's kind of like a marriage , really ... except not as many- - not as many fii ghts . - I mean , some fii ghts . - Luke . Tell us what happened here . I- - We fii red the radar ... and it- - it came , and they all died . They all- - They all died . Wh-What do you mean ? What- - What came ? The force came out ofthe top ofthe mountain and-and-and ... everybody died , but I was spared . Why ? Why ? Had to be for a reason . And then all ofa sudden , I knew the reason why . It 's so someone would be left to fii gure out the secret . You know ? It 's- - J-J-J ust come.Just come , come , come , come , come , come . Is itjust me , or is he a few meal packs short ofa picnic ? Long-term exposure to low gravity can have an adverse impact on the brain . Or then , he could be suffering from some form ofasphyxia . Or maybe his whole crew died , and he 's been marooned alone on Mars for a year . It 's a miracle he 's survived this long . I 'd better bring him up to speed . Great , great . Great , great , great , great . So let me be sure I understand this . Your ship blew up with all its supplies . Then you- - Then you emptied all the cargo out ofthe REMO ... and it was totalled on landing . You got no food , no water , no , no spare oxygen . Nothing other than what I 'm looking at right here . What kind- - What kind of rescue mission is this , Jim ? That kind . Check it out . New nav boards for the ERV . I got four round-trip tickets , baby , right in here . Thankyou , God ! Oh , thank God . When I came to and dug myselfout ofthe sand , my faceplate was cracked . It was leaking . Leaking badly . I barely made it back to base . It was weeks before I could work up the nerve to go back out there and look for- - and look for their bodies . Renee was the only one I could fii nd , but itjust didn 't seem right somehow tojust dig one grave . Oh , God . Has it been blowing like this for a while ? Yeah . We saw a big storm on our screens , but Micker said it was turning south . If it holds course . Luke , this- - this whatever it was . This- - This force . You said it came directly out ofthe top ofthe mountain ? Don 't you believe me ? That 's okay , Jim . You don 't believe me , that 's okay , but I 'm not crazy . - I know that much . I 'm not crazy . - What 'd you mean by its " secret " ? What secret ? Listen , hundred of millions ofyears have gone by , okay ? You got erosion , lava flow , sandstorms , meteor impacts . Hell , in that much time , the whole surface ofthe planet would have changed . So it 's no wonder we never saw it before . I mean , we saw it , but not like they meant us to . - There was too much dirt on it . - Saw what , Luke ? Saw this . Jesus . Oh , my God . Luke , what are you trying to tell us ? - You 're trying to tell us that that 's a face ? - That 's the face . It 's the face . It 's real . Somebody put that thing there , and it 's not us . Jim- - It 's not possible . Jesus . Look at that . My God . I know . Luke , uh , what- - what about that sound you heard before the explosion ? Oh , yeah . Good , Jim . Th-Th-That 's the key . That 's the key . - You hear that ? - Yeah . - It 's pauses . Do you hear the pauses ? - Yeah . See , that 's what made me realize it 's a pattern . It 's a repeating pattern . - Mathematical ? - Mm-hmm . That occurred to me too . There are distinct blocks within each pattern ... and within each block , the tones come in groups ofthree . It 's three , three , three , three , three , three . It 's always three , three , three . It 's always the same . And , see , for months I struggled to analyse it , you know ... trying different constructs , and then I thought about dimensions . - X-Y-Z coordinates . - Exactly . Three groups equals three dimensions . So l-l assigned different graphic values to each block group and tone ... and I came up with this . - Hello . - Oh , my God . - Is that what I think it is ? - DNA ? - You see it ? - Yeah . - It 's a model of DNA . - So- - So somebody left that thing here . Okay . Somebody other than human . But , uh , what is it ? It 's a signature . It 's a self-portrait ofwhatever species created the face . Yeah , but , uh , that DNA looks human . - No . - No , it 's not . It 's missing the last pair ofchromosomes . See ? - This is close . It 's damn close . - " Close " ? The difference between man and ape is less than three percent genetic material . But that three percent gives you Einstein , Mozart . Jack the Ripper . Yeah , he 's right . Four pallets , oral , topical medications ... splints , bandages , one complete med pack . With eight tubes ofantifungal cream . Well , at least we won 't rash to death . Luke . How do you feel ? Lighter . A lot lighter . - Welcome back . - Thanks , man . The backup generator is salvageable . So are two ofthe solar panels . I 'm pretty sure I can get the oxygen still back into production . So we 're not in such bad shape , considering . That 's good , Terri . Good work . Jesus . Look at this . Phil 's idea ofabsolute essentials . Ofcourse . Hey , hey , hey . Hey ! My baby . - It 's not a signature . - What ? The noise from the face . It 's not a signature . It 's a test . It 's asking us for the right answer . It wants us to put in the missing pair ofchromosomes . Why ? To prove that we 're human . We fii red radar into that thing , concentrated radio waves , and you 're saying- - Which it interpreted as the wrong answer . It 's- - It could be like a security alarm . When it gets an incorrect response , it defends itself . So what happens when it gets the right answer ? Well , I don 't know that , Phil . But we gotta fii nd out . Luke , what ifwe work this the other way ? We fii gure out which tones would be equivalent to the missing chromosomes ... and then dub them into your recording ofthe signal . - Is that possible ? - Yeah . - Yeah , I think so . - Good , good , good . What about the radar gun ? Will it accept the input so we can transmit a completed signal back to the face ? Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Hold on , Jim . What ifyou 're wrong ? Whoever goes out there- - I mean , what ifyou 're wrong ? Three people have already died over that thing . Four . Terri . Ifwe leave here without getting some answers , they all died in vain . We don 't- - We don 't have to go out there . Got a lot ofstatic here . Something 's interfering . Yeah . The antenna got knocked around pretty badly in the blast . This is the best resolution I think we 're gonna be able to get . All right , guys . I got the nav boards . I 'm sealing the airlock . - Check the video feed . - Video feed looks good . - How close do we have to get ? - I 'm not sure . Maybe I 'll stop it right over there by that rock . Do it . Good . Okay . Here we go . Look at that , Jim . It worked . Oh , God , it worked . Guys , I don 't know what the hell wejust did ... but does that look to you like a hostile gesture ? No . More like an invitation . Or another test . - Check for radiation . - Normal . Seismic : Normal . Anemometer : Steady . Luke ... does the rover still work ? Phil , do you read ? Uh , yeah , Jim , your signal 's breaking up a little in the storm , but I read you . We 're at the face . We 're gonna need a few minutes here . Same deadline . Launch at 1 950 with or without us . Copy ? Copy that . Jim . You sure you wanna do this ? I 'm not sure about anything any more . But I didn 't come 1 00 million miles just to turn back in the last ten feet . Yeah . Please work . It 's gonna work . Yes . Yes . Computers are on-line . I am gonna start loading software . The surface ... seems fii rm and level . Roger that . The texture 's smooth . I 've got good footing . No obstructions . - Let 's check our psi . - Okay . Guys , I gotta tell you ... we 're losing visibility here really fast . Over . It 's solid . We 're trapped . Don 't move . Just keep this orientation . Guys ? Luke ? Terri ? Jim ? Phil , can you still hear me ? Is anyone there ? Over . God . That 's it . There 's no handles . We 're not getting out of here unless they let us out . - Jim.Jim , what are you doing ? - Jim , what are you doing ? - Jim.Jim , your suit ! - Stop . Stop it ! Jim , you 're depressurizing . - Seal your suit . - Come on ! - Seal your suit now ! There 's pressure in here . Above Mars atmospheric ? It 's impossible . We 're millions of miles from Earth inside a giant white face . What 's impossible ? There 's 1 2 PSI in here . Nitrogen and oxygen . Otherwise known as air . Hey , wait , Jim . I haven 't checked for lethal trace gases , and I haven 't- - What the hell . Look . - That what I think it is ? - Yeah . It 's Mars . That 's where they went . Look . One stayed behind . Earth , before the continents separated . My God . That 's it . Hundreds of millions ofyears ago ... there was a sudden explosion of life on Earth . The fil rst multi-celled plants and animals appeared . No one has ever understood why or how it happened . They seeded Earth . They 're us . We 're them . Luke ? Terri ? Jim ? Anyone ? ERV to rover . Rover , this is ERV . Does anyone copy ? Does anyone copy ? ER Vto rover . Rover , this is ER V. Doyou copy ? - Phil ? - Oh , thank God , lgotyou . - Phil , we read you . - Listen , thestorm isgetting bad , really bad . It 'sgonna totallysock us in in a fewminutes . You 've got toget back to theship . - Phil ? - Irepeat , you 've got to get back to theship . Phil ? We 're in a ship . This is a ship . And the countdown 's already started . - He 's right . - Yeah . Yeah , let 's- - let 's get the hell out of here . Jim ? Jim . Come on . We gotta go . - I 'm not coming with you . - What ? What are you talking about ? We 've gotta get home . That 's where I 'm going . Don 't you see ? That 's- - That 's what all this is for . Terri , you were right . This is an invitation . This is an invitation for us to follow them home . I 'm going . It 's what I was born for . Like Maggie said : " To stand on a new world and- - and look beyond it ... to the next one . " I know this is right . For me . And you 're running out oftime . You gotta get back to the ERV and you gotta get off this planet . Thankyou for saving my life , buddy . It was a privilege . I wish Woody were here to see you . He is here , Terri . We wouldn 't have made it without him . He would have wanted you to have this . ERV to rover . Rover , this is ERV . Do you copy ? ERV to rover . Rover , this is ERV . Do you read me ? Phil , this is Luke . Do you copy ? - He 's not reading me . - I can barely read you . - Let 's get the hell out of here . - Yeah . I 've lost the base camp beacon . We 're driving blind . I 'm just gonna keep going on a straight line , okay ? That 's our only chance . - 1 949 . Terri , we 're not gonna make it . - No . I 've worked with Phil for fouryears , and I knowJim gave him a direct order , but he is not gonna leave without us . Please . Luke ? Terri ? Jim ? ERV to rover . Rover , this is ERV . Do you read me ? Phil , doyou read ? This is Luke . We 're coming in . Phil . - Phil ! - Phil isn 't here right now . He , uh , left for Earth fiive minutes ago ! Please leave a message after the beep ! Where isJim ? He caught another ride . - Dear God , look at that . - Is that him ? Have a great ride , Jim .

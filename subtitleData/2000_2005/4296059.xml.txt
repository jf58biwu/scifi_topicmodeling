 [ Scratching ] [ Scratching Stops ] [ Scratching Resumes ] [ High-pitched Scratching ] Dad ! Dad ! Tommy ? What is it ? I 'm afraid . I heard something . It 's just the wind . No . I think it 's under the bed . Can you check ? Tommy , there is nothing to be scared of , I promise . No . There 's something under the bed . You have to check . All clear . You sure ? I thought I saw something ... in the mirror . Tommy , it is just your imagination . Now , let 's try to get some sleep , okay ? [ Scratching ] [ Scratching Grows Louder ] [ Screams ] Dad , help ! It 's in here ! Help ! Help me ! Help ! Help ! Dad ! [ Doorknob Rattling ] It 's in here ! Help ! Help me ! Dad ! Daddy ! Dad ! [ Bell Ringing ] [ Man ] Dr. Scully ... Sorry . After lunch . All questions answered after lunch . Thank you . Agent Scully . Leyla Harrison . What a surprise . Oh , good . I was afraid I should have maybe called first . How have you been ? Oh , uh ... busy . And yourself ? I 'm back in Accounting now . Happily , mind you . No regrets . Although I did relish my big adventure ... on the X-Files unit last year . I have about five minutes ... uh , before my next class . Can we talk while I eat ? Not a problem . It 's an X-File . I 'm sure of it . - Where did you get this ? - It all started when I tracked down ... a mileage discrepancy in the Bureau 's vehicle fleet . It turns out a really nice secretary ... from our Baltimore field office ... had used a Ford Taurus without authorization . And what does that have to do with ... Well , she was desperate to visit her grandson ... which is why she borrowed the car . She 's the one who told me about this case . This was her daughter . And what makes you think this is an X-File ? Well , this dead woman 's son ... my friend 's grandson ... This is Tommy Conlon . Tommy is eight years old . And Tommy told her ... a monster killed his mother . And his father knows all about it . I know , I know . Why take the word of an eight-year-old ? But ... look at the autopsy report . Clearly this woman was murdered , and yet ... And yet the coroner concludes ... that she stabbed herself to death . Agent Harrison ... I see no reason to disagree with the coroner . But ... I mean , how could someone stab themselves 16 times ? Look , it is unusual ... but I have seen it before . Tommy 's father took the boy ... to some mountaintop in Pennsylvania ... in the middle of nowhere . Took him away from his friends ... his family . They don 't even have a phone . Tommy 's own grandmother ... isn 't allowed to see him anymore . I 'm sorry , Agent Harrison ... but unless you have other evidence ... Wait , wait . Tommy said that the same monster that killed his mother ... killed Spanky , his pet cat . Uh , unless you bring me Spanky , there 's nothing I can do . [ Bell Ringing ] Apple and tuna salad ? [ Phone Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] Hello . Dana , it 's Monica Reyes . Did I catch you at a bad time ? I was just putting the baby down . What is it ? I wanted to get your opinion ... on an autopsy finding . It 's pretty unusual . A woman who stabbed herself 16 times . Last name Conlon ? I assume you 've been talking to Leyla Harrison ? Yeah . The three of us are headed ... to Pennsylvania , in fact . It sounds like you 're familiar with the case . What do you mean , " There is no case " ? Oh , right . Thanks . Why didn 't you tell us ... you 'd already gone to Agent Scully ? I didn 't know that 's who you were going to call . That 's not the point , Leyla . You misled us . Agent Doggett , we 're almost there . " How 'd you spend your Friday night , John ? " Running around like an idiot . Agent Doggett . Both of you ... got in this car believing a little boy may be in danger . What 's changed since then ? Even if this isn 't an X-File ... which it is ... what will it hurt to keep going ? [ Exasperated Sigh ] If Agent Mulder were here , he 'd keep going . [ Shoveling ] [ Panting ] [ Car Approaching ] Jeffrey Conlon ? Yeah . Can I help you ? Hi . I 'm Agent Monica Reyes . This is AgentJohn Doggett and Agent Harrison . We 're with the F.B.I. F.B.I. Really ? We 're here at the request of Dorothy ... your mother-in-law . She 's worried about her grandson . Tommy is fine . I told Dorothy over and over . There 's really nothing more to say . Is that blood on your hand , Mr. Conlon ? Yeah , I cut myself . On what ? A piece of broken glass . Sir , can we speak with your son ? He 's asleep . [ Doggett ] It 's not even 7 : 00 . It 's kind of early for bedtime , isn 't it ? Not for Tommy . And I 'd appreciate it if you 'd ... keep your voice down . Look , I 'm going to be straight with you . We drove a long way . [ Reyes ] Agent Doggett is very stubborn . I don 't think you 'll get him to leave ... until we see your son . [ Boy ] Dad ? Tommy , go back inside , please . I heard something . I got afraid . [ Reyes ] Hi , Tommy . I 'm Monica . This is John , and this is Leyla . I 'm friends with your grandmom . She wanted us to come see how you were doing . Tommy , it 's too cold out here . Go back inside the house , please . Do you remember ... what you said to your grandmom ? Something about your mother . Do you remember ? Monsters . You said there were monsters , right ? No such thing as monsters . Tell Dorothy this is exactly why ... she 's not allowed to visit anymore . Now , good night . Come on . [ Door Closes ] I apologize . I let my imagination run wild ... and I ruined both your evenings . Thank you in advance for not yelling at me . Something 's going on here . Wait ... There is ? That little boy only said what his father wanted him to say . Did you notice the dirt on that guy 's hands and knees ? He 's been digging . This time of the year ... he sure as hell ain 't gardening . I say we find a judge ... get a warrant ... search the place . [ Sighs ] Dad ? The monsters aren 't going to let those people leave ... are they ? They 're leaving , Tommy . They 're leaving right now . It 's too late . [ Engine Sputtering ] What the hell ? [ Reyes Shrieks ] Oh , God . A possum , maybe ? That doesn 't make any sense . How 'd it get from here into the vents ? [ Knocking ] [ Loud Pounding ] Who is it ? It 's Gabe Rotter . I have the thing you 've been waiting for . Who ? Gabe ... Rotter . I 'm a friend of Leyla Harrison . Do you know what time it is ? Hey , I just do as I 'm told . Enjoy . Whoa . What the hell is that ? A dead cat . Come again ? Yeah , his name 's Spanky . Leyla said you 're helping her out on a case ... and you needed it ASAP , so ... Hey , you 're welcome . I am going to be exceptionally polite . Leave . Now . Leave now and take that with you . Do you have any idea what ... I went through to get this thing ? I snuck onto the property ... where your perp there used to live ... and I dug up the whole thing looking for it . I don 't care . Leave ! Now ! Please ! Uh-uh . Leyla said she 'd go out with me ... only if I got you the cat , and damn it , I got it . Oh , God ... You calling the cops on me ? If only . God help me ... but Agent Harrison might be on to something after all . Any luck ? Our engine 's completely shot . His truck won 't start ... even though I can 't find one damn thing wrong with it . Looks like we 're here for the night . I 'd better get Tommy back to sleep . Phones that won 't work , cars that won 't start . It reminds me of a case Mulder and Scully investigated . A teenager who was struck by lightning ... his body affected the electrical workings ... of everything around him . I don 't think that 's what we 're dealing with here , Leyla . Agent Mulder wasted no time closing that case . I just try to think like him . What would Agents Mulder and Scully do ... if they were in this situation ? Agents Mulder and Scully aren 't in this situation . Agents Doggett and Reyes are . I don 't know about Agent Reyes ... but Agent Doggett 's going to sit his tired ass down . What kind of a course of action is that ? I think Agent Doggett is saying that ... right now , we 're in the best possible place . Exactly . Bottom line ... we 're all concerned for this boy 's safety . As long as we 're here , nothing 's going to happen ... to him , right ? [ Tommy ] Help ! It 's in here ! Daddy ! Help ! Help me ! Dad ! Dad ! Hey ! No , don 't do it ! John . [ Sighs ] How 's he doing ? He 's a hell of a lot calmer ... than I 'd be . I checked the place top to bottom . Whatever the hell those things were , they 're gone . I have no idea where they went . That 's really good , Tommy . Is that you ? Who 's that ? That 's her . Tommy , tellJohn what you told me ... about what we saw in your room tonight . Those are the monsters that hurt my mommy . But my dad says I 'm not supposed to talk about it . This is my house . Why do I have to sit here ? Tell me what we 're dealing with . I don 't ... Don 't tell me you don 't know ... because you 're not going to like what happens next . These things were in the room with your son and you knew it . You held the door shut , you son of a bitch . Want to see something ? Look at that . Look at that . That 's what they did to me . They almost killed me one time before . They ? What are they ? Some kind of animal ? What ? All I know is that ... they won 't leave us alone ... and I 'm dealing with this the best way I can . Now it 's too late . How 's that ? They mean to kill every one of you ... and there 's nothing you can do to stop it . Oh , come on . You saw what happens . You think you 've killed one ... and then it becomes two . I don 't think Mr. Conlon is telling us the whole truth . No kidding . I mean , I think you can kill them ... because I don 't know what else he would have been burying ... when we showed up tonight . You got to be freaking kidding me . I can 't believe you 're cutting up a dead cat ... on your kitchen table . Will you keep your voice down , please ? You 're going to wake my baby . This ... This just isn 't right . Can you clue me in here as to why the cat 's so important ? Because it would seem that poor Spanky here ... may have chewed a hole in his own stomach . Which you 'll admit ... is unusual behavior . You mean ... he killed himself . Just like his owner , Mrs. Conlon ... stabbed herself with a knife . The wounds are in the same place ... and if we figure out why ... well , then , you 'll have something really good ... to share with your good friend Leyla Harrison , won 't you ? True that . [ Phone Rings ] Can you hold the ribs open while I grab that , please ? Just ... now . Thank you . Agent Scully . Yeah , ma 'am , this is SheriffJack Coogan . I got a message to call this number . Hi , Sheriff . Thanks for getting back to me . I appreciate it . I 'm an F.B.I. Agent ... and I 've been trying to reach three of my colleagues ... that are up in your area . Were they on some kind of case ? Well , they 're looking into some concerns ... expressed by the grandmother of a child . The family name is Conlon , and I have an address ... No need . I was back up there a couple of weeks ago . Got into a kind of a shouting match with the father . Over what ? The grandmother asked me to look in on the boy . Father told me to get the hell off his property . Boy seemed fine , so I did . Well , as I say , Sheriff , I need to contact my colleagues . I 'm happy to take a drive up there ... but can 't promise much tonight . The roads are icing up as we speak . Won 't be easy getting in . Look , Sheriff , they may be in danger . Could you please find a way ? [ Crunching Noise ] Ow ! Oh , my God . It 's no monster , Agent Harrison . Dead or alive . You want to explain this , Mr. Conlon ? It 's just a mirror from my son 's room . Why 'd you bury it ? 'Cause he was afraid of it . I want you to get Tommy bundled up in warm clothes . I want you to pack anything you think he might need . Why ? 'Cause I don 't believe one damn thing you 've told me ... except that we 're in danger ... and we 're walking out of here , all five of us . I know what you 're thinking . Black magic . Mirrors are powerful symbols in conjuring in the dark arts . That 's what this is . Right ? [ Dryly ] Uh-huh . We passed a sheriff 's station maybe six miles ... down the mountain . It 'll be a hike , but we can make it . Dad , the sheriff ... No . Tommy ... Don 't worry about the sheriff . He 's going to help us . What 's up , Tommy ? What 's the matter ? [ Knocking ] Stay here . Man , you 're a sight for sore eyes . John Doggett . I 'm the sheriff . Who called you ? Perfect timing . We were just leaving , Sheriff . We need a ride . Sorry , you can 't leave . What do you mean ? You can 't go anywhere . It 's too cold . It 's not him . What ? Gun ! [ Grunting ] Let him go ! [ Squishing Noise ] Oh . So , this is Johnny Fabulous , huh ? [ Chuckles ] Oh ... " Mulder 's so smart . Mulder 's so dreamy . " That 's all Leyla ever talks about . Mulder and Scully , Scully and Mulder , blah , blah , blah . [ Sighs ] This sheriff , Jack Coogan ... I 'm just getting his answering machine . Hey , you 're really worried . I thought you didn 't find anything . You told me there wasn 't anything inside that cat . No , there wasn 't . But it certainly seems like there should have been . What does that mean ? Well , the pattern of bite marks . I mean , it seems to me that the cat was trying ... to get at something in its stomach ... to chew something out . Something . What ? I don 't know . I mean , there wasn 't any sign of it ... but it obviously caused a great deal of pain . And I 'm thinking maybe it goes the same ... for the woman who tried to stab herself . I mean , what if that was a frantic attempt ... to ... to cut something out . Wait a minute . Is Leyla in danger up there ? All I know is we 're wasting our time talking about this . Who are you calling now ? My mom . I 'm going to beg her to baby-sit . Got anything ? Yeah . A salad spoon no one 's ever going to use again . And the sheriff here ? Do not ask me to explain it ... but he 's got absolutely no internal organs . He 's like , he 's like a big bag . You know what else ? This isn 't blood . Whatever it is , I bet it 's the same crap ... that 's all over the inside of our car . I 've been thinking . You know , I hate to sound like Agent Harrison ... but Mulder and Scully had a case like this ... that I remember where they were trapped ... underground with these mushroom spores ... that caused hallucinations . Never mind . I don 't know what to say , either . Maybe Mulder and Scully would see something ... that we don 't . How ? Nothing here makes any sense . Unless that 's the very thing that we need to see . Agent Harrison , you want to take Tommy up to his room ? Sure . Come on , Tommy . What 's the matter ? You like Leyla , don 't you ? Can you stay with me instead ? Sure . Come on . I 'm just a cop , Mr. Conlon . Maybe I don 't have the imagination to connect ... all the pieces of this insanity together . You said that wasn 't exactly the sheriff in there ... and I want to know what you meant . In fact , you tried to warn us ... that bag of goo wasn 't the sheriff . You were trying to help us . Yeah , so why not help us now ? Tell us what you know , Mr. Conlon ... for Tommy 's sake . [ Doggett ] Your son , Tommy ... you move him up here in the middle of nowhere ... and you lock him in the room with those things . Now , if you 're just trying to get rid of him ... is that all this is ? I love my son . I love my son , you bastard . Well , you locked him in the room with those things . Because I knew they wouldn 't hurt him . Now , why is that ? They hurt you ... they certainly hurt your wife . Why didn 't they hurt Tommy ? I made this . You drew all these ? This one 's you . Why would you draw this , Tommy ? Why would you imagine such awful things ? Because I 'm afraid . Sheriff Coogan ? Sheriff ? Are you Agent Scully ? Yeah . I , uh , I still can 't contact my partners . Were you able to get up there ? I just got back from trying . The roads at that elevation are way too dangerous right now . Well , Sheriff , there are three F.B.I. Agents ... who may be in grave danger . That 's my girlfriend up there , Hoss . This is the only road up to that mountain . We 've got ice leading all the way up to the peak . Well , we have to get up there . I mean , there must be a way . I 'm sorry . Helicopter , snowplow or pack mule ... Unfortunately , I 'm fresh out of all three . [ Harrison ] What ifTommy were at the center of this somehow ? The monsters ... the sheriff . Agent Doggett ? Where the hell is the body ? [ Grunting ] Monica , what happened ? The boy ! [ Groaning ] The boy , it 's all him . [ Groaning ] Oh , my God . Is your son doing this ? I told you . I told you to leave . If this is your son , make him stop . I can 't . You don 't think I 've tried ? I can 't stop him from ... from imagining things . I can 't stop him from being afraid . He 's just a little boy ! He doesn 't mean to do these things . The hell he doesn 't ! [ Groaning ] If you won 't stop him , I will . Tommy ? Stay right there . [ Grunts ] [ Scratching Sound ] [ Gasping ] [ Yelling , Grunting ] [ Reyes Screaming ] Please ! Please ! You have to get it out ! Get it out of me ! Agent Reyes , hold on . Please , hold on . [ Screaming ] Mr. Conlon , help us . [ Gasps ] Oh , my God ! [ Reyes ] Please ! [ Gasps ] Listen to me ... and listen good . These things ... These things aren 't happening . What ? How the hell could they be ? It 's like I 've been saying all along . It 's not possible . No , this is all real . My wife is dead . She believed it was real and she stabbed herself . But because I couldn 't believe it ... not really ... it couldn 't hurt me . Now , come on . You 're going to help me . Dad ? Dad ! Dad , get in here ! [ Footsteps ] [ Reyes Groaning ] [ Conlon ] Wait . Wait a minute . Where are you going ? You wait here . What are you doing ? What are you doing ? You 're a smart boy , Tommy . What 's it look like I 'm doing ? No way . If I don 't stop you ... my friends are going to die . You think I 'm going to let that happen ? You won 't do it . You 're lying . You 'd get burned , too . You 're just trying to scare me . Scared yet ? [ Sighs ] Oh , thank God . Agent Harrison ? Monica , are you all right ? Where 's John ? Ow ! Ow . Tommy . He 's breathing . Passed out . I 'm a medical doctor . You 're all right ? Water . You filled it with water . That 's not what Tommy believed . " I want to believe . " Huh . So , this is where the magic happened , huh ? It still happens . I 'm happy it 's in good hands . Hey . Speak of the devil . That so ? Leyla keeps ... going on and on about how you saved the day . I really do have to commend you , Agent Doggett . You solved this case . If it weren 't for you ... I don 't even like to think what would have happened . I have to say , it 's clear to me now ... that you were better-equipped for this challenge ... than even Agent Mulder would have been . I mean , your lack of imagination saved our lives . Gee , thanks . That didn 't come out right . Did it ? So , any news on the boy ? We just got back from the psych center . Their doctors don 't quite know what to make of him . I think it goes without saying . However , they have come up ... with a stopgap treatment . [ Scully ] What 's that ? [ Doggett ] A way to stifle his imagination .

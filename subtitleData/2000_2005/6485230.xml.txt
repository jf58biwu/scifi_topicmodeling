 Unit four . I got a fire on the horizon , at the 20-mile marker . Confirmation of downed aircraft burning . All units , you 've got a 10-13 . Unit four , this is Detective Miles . I 'm coming right at you , Ray . Now , you wait for backup before you head out , all right ? Unit four ? Come back , Deputy . Deputy Hoese ? Ray ? Oh , my God . Lariat Car Rentals totals ... Would you like to see the figure ? - Is that a lot ? - A lot ? Gas , expenses , the motel rooms alone . By FBI standards these numbers are out of control . We could start sharing rooms . You 're under evaluation . There has to be a point when we say no . You can 't compare what we do to other departments . - Right . This business with aliens . - There 's more to it than that . But at the end of the day , aliens are your focus . That 's the reason I got started , yeah . Investigating your sister 's abduction and the government conspiracy around it . Both of which have been resolved . Correct ? Nothing has been resolved , exactly . In this case report , it is concluded your sister is dead , as well as the men who took her . This is your handwriting here on the report , Agent Mulder ? - Yeah . - So , what exactly is left to investigate ? Your release has been arranged . Marita Covarrubias . The last time I saw you , I left you for dead . Alex , if it were strictly up to me , I 'd leave you here to rot too . I see the money bleed out , but it just doesn 't seem to make the results of your work any better . So many of your cases are left unexplained . Makes it hard to justify the expense . So much of the work that we do cannot be measured in standard terms . - How would you measure it ? - We open doors with the X-Files , which lead to other doors . Doors leading to ... " A conspiracy of men who cooperated with alien beings to create human-alien hybrids . " So we could all become slaves of an alien invasion . I believe that there was once a conspiracy . I believe I was taken by men who subjected me to medical tests , which gave me cancer and left me barren . But you don 't believe in aliens ? I 've seen things that I cannot deny . Who sent you ? The Smoking Man . He is dying . - You said you were finished . - I was asked to go over a few things . As you know , the times we live in , the world is changing fast . I 'm missing your point . As I said , this is an evaluation to understand what you do . So , if you go forward , you can do so more responsibly . - That sounds more like a threat . - Cost-benefit analysis . But if you want the truth , I really don 't care one way or the other . You mostly record bizarre facts on bizarre cases . In other words , information gathering . Something , it seems to me , you can easily do on the Internet . I can 't do my job from an office , I promise you . Nowadays , the most advanced space exploration is done sitting in an office . Why ? It 's just too damn expensive putting men in outer space . - I 'm not looking in outer space . - Bringing us to the point . If you spend such time and money looking for aliens , you should narrow your search . - To where ? - Wherever they are . It 's not unreasonable . It 's just a matter of reducing your vision . Hey , you all right ? What 's the problem ? - Isn 't that your car , Mr Miles ? - Yeah . A small accident . Everything 's all right . What are you boys doing out here ? Well , we heard there was a plane crash . Military jet fighter collided midair with a UFO . The navy found their plane about three miles away . We 've seen no evidence of any other crash . But we heard a sheriff say he saw a fire burning off the highway at the 20-mile mark . There 's nothing out here . No fire . No sign of fire . You boys go on home . There 's nothing to see here . I think I 'm in big trouble . How many times have they tried to shut us down ? But I never actually assaulted an auditor before . - Did you hurt him ? - I reduced his vision a little bit . - Mulder . - Agent Fox Mulder ? Speaking . My name is Billy Miles . I don 't know if you remember me . Oregon , seven years ago . You had multiple abduction experiences . I 'm here with Agent Scully . - Billy , are you all right ? - Yeah . This may seem weird , me calling like this , but I don 't know where else to turn . Is it happening again , Billy ? Yeah , but not to me this time . More alien abductions , Scully . I don 't know how we could possibly justify the expense . We 'd probably turn up nothing . Let 's go waste some money . Hi . He 's anxious to see you . - I was worried about you , Alex . - Cut the crap , old man . I heard about your incarceration . You had me thrown in that hellhole . For trying to sell something that was mine , was it not ? I hope we can all move forward . Put the past behind us . We have a ... singular opportunity now . - A singular opportunity ? - There 's been a crash in Oregon . An alien ship has collided with a military aircraft . Recovery is all-important . It 's Roswell and Corona all over again , 50 years later . It 's our chance to rebuild the project . How do you know someone hasn 't already recovered it ? It 's never quite so easy . - I 'm getting something here , Gary . - I told you . Richie . Hey , man . Look at this . Gary ! Gary ? Come on , man . Agent Mulder and Agent Scully . Look who 's wearing a badge . I never thought of myself as a cop but it 's been three years now . My dad got them to fudge the psych qualifications . - You 're married , Billy . - Divorced . I live back with my dad now . You 've never ... Have you ever been able to get over the abductions ? Well , I have . But people haven 't . No one really believes it . My dad still denies it ever happened , that any one of us was taken . Does he deny that it 's happening now ? There was a crash . A navy pilot hit an unidentified aircraft outside of town . The military found their jet but the other craft hasn 't been recovered . - Why not ? - We 're in charge of coordinating efforts , but my dad has really been no help , even though we have a deputy missing . You find the UFO and he won 't be able to deny the truth . I hope that 's all it is . What 's going on ? Talking to some people you might remember , from the FBI . - Agent Scully , Agent Mulder . - Oh . What brings you folks out here ? You 're not thinking this incident 's some kind of UFO ? - Crash of an unidentified craft . - I 've been on with the FAA . You might wanna follow up . Looks an awful lot like there was no crash at all . Deja vu all over again . That was there already , in case you 're wondering about it . I watched Agent Mulder paint that there seven years ago . - What for ? - To mark an electrical disturbance . The kind where time bends or goes missing , or where your car loses power and dies . These skid marks are mine . So was the deputy 's car up there without his lights on ? If they 'd been on , I would have seen him . Good point . Detective ? Did the deputy carry a 38 ? 38 Super . Why ? Three shells were discharged . I imagine they could have rolled from up there . - What was he shooting at ? - Probably nothing . - Nothing ? - Nothing 's all you seem to find out here . Was the missing deputy a good cop ? Sure , I guess . Married ? Single ? Bill . - Come on over here with those . - Married . New baby . You know , they only wanna solve this . Get in the car , Bill . Yes ? Sorry to bother you . We 're with the FBI . - Is this about my husband ? - You 're Teresa ? Teresa Nemman ? Yes . Seven years ago you came to us for help . You were afraid of being abducted . Oh , my God . Please , come in . I 'm sorry . I sort of lost it when I realized who you were . We came to see if there 's anything you could tell us that might help to find your husband . We had no idea you were his wife . I don 't know if it 's important , maybe I just hope it 's not , but Ray and I have a connection that 's even deeper for us . He 's an abductee too ? He kept it a secret from almost everyone . It doesn 't make you real popular around here . His experiences were a lot more terrifying than mine . He was taken many times and tested . I have extensive medical records on him and photos of his scars . I 'll get you the files . What do you see ? What do you see ? Once upon a time there was a little baby - Who is it ? - It 's me . - What 's wrong ? You look sick . - I don 't know what 's wrong . Come in . I , um ... I was starting to get ready for bed and I started to feel really dizzy , vertigo or something , and then I just ... I started to get chills . You want me to call a doctor ? No , I just ... I just wanna get warm . Thank you . It 's not worth it , Scully . - What ? - I want you to go home . Mulder , I 'm gonna be fine . No , I 've been thinking about it . Looking at you tonight , holding that baby . Knowing everything that 's been taken away from you . A chance for motherhood and your health and that baby . I think that ... I don 't know , maybe they 're right . - Who 's right ? - The FBI . Maybe what they say is true . Though for all the wrong reasons , it 's the personal costs that are too high . There 's so much more you need to do with your life . There 's so much more than this . There has to be an end , Scully . In spite of a great deal of effort , no one seems to be able to find this UFO of yours . - Of course they can 't . - You know why ? Cos it 's not here . It 's there , Alex . I 'm certain of it . Hidden in plain sight . You listen to me . If you 're gonna play games , Mulder and Scully will beat me to it . Are you saying that Mulder and Scully are there looking for the UFO ? They 're looking for a missing deputy . They 're looking for the right thing but in the wrong place . You sent me looking for a ship . Find the deputy . Find the ship . Who is it ? Ray ? Oh , my God . Oh , my God . I was so worried . I was so sure ... What did they do to you this time ? Ray , talk to me . You 're not my husband . No ! No ! - What happened , Billy ? - Teresa 's gone . - She 's been taken . And they took her . - How do you know ? The door was open . Scully ? The floor . What do you see ? The same thing as out on the road . You 've seen it before . Yeah . I have . We both have . What is it ? It 's a biological toxin emitted as a gas through the bloodstream . - From who ? - From what is arguably an alien . - You OK ? - Yeah . You sure ? Yeah , I 'm fine , thanks . Thank you , Greta . Why the trouble ? To bring Krycek here and then toy with him ? Do you trust Alex , Marita ? - Then why bring him here at all ? - You misunderstand . I 've great faith that Alex will find the ship . But if I told him how , he 'd be ... he 'd be tempted to sell the information . - And you 're certain it 's there ? - Yes . But it won 't be there for ever . It 's rebuilding itself . If he finds the ship , then what ? To possess it ... is to possess the answer to all things . Every possible imaginable question . - To God ? - There 's no God , Marita . What we call God is only alien . An intelligence much greater than us . They 're coming here , aren 't they ? They 're only coming back . Mulder ? Hey . What are you doing ? Just standing there . Is that against the law ? - You know this guy ? - Yeah . - What are you doing , Richie ? - They took him . - They took Gary . He was just gone . - Relax . Slow down . They 're out there . I don 't care what your dad says . - My dad ? - He was out there too . He knows . I was shining my flashlight in the dark , looking for the UFO , and the beam hit this spot in space , like it bent the light . - And then what happened ? - I yelled " Gary ! " And I looked ... but he wasn 't there , you know ? He wasn 't anywhere , man . And then the flashlight got really hot and I dropped it . It 's right around here somewhere . Oh , hey . Here it is . Scully ? Scully ? Scully . - Want some water ? - What happened ? Can you just get her some water ? I just ... I just ... I just hit the ground . Here , lie still . Why is this happening to me ? It 's OK . It 's OK . What the hell 's going on , Mulder ? I don 't know . These aren 't just random abductions . - We 've gotta warn Billy Miles of that . - Warn him of what ? These abductees aren 't just systematically being taken . They 're not coming back . Dad ? Billy . - What are you doing ? - Stay where you are . - Billy , it 's me . - I said stay where you are ! - Dammit , Billy , listen to me . - No . I don 't know who you are but you are not gonna take me . I 'm your father . Are you gonna shoot your father ? If you 're my father , then why won 't you believe me ? I believe you , Billy . I just want it all to go away . Give me the gun , son . Billy ? Billy ? Mulder . What 's our punishment this time ? Thumbscrews or 40 lashes ? Come on in , Walter . Sit a spell . This could be the last time you take a trip down to these offices . You went to Oregon . Guilty as charged . And if they 're coming down on you for that , I 'm sorry . I truly am . Fortunately , they think I make a contribution to the Bureau . Well , stick to a budget and they say you 're making a contribution . But push your profession and you 're out of control . You could find a flying saucer and have an alien meet the president . What it comes down to , Agent Mulder , is ... they don 't like you . We didn 't bring home a flying saucer or an alien . Yeah , so I 've been told . Wait a minute , Mulder ! I think you should listen to him . You got every reason to want to see me dead . But you gotta listen to me now . You have a singular opportunity . - Here or you wanna step outside ? - Agent Mulder . Cancer Man is dying . His last wish is to rebuild his project , to revive the conspiracy . It all begins in Oregon . The ship that collided with that navy plane , it 's in those woods . - There 's no ship in those woods . - It 's there , cloaked in an energy field . - While he mops up the evidence . - Who ? The alien bounty hunter . Billy Miles . Teresa Hoese . Her husband . He 's eliminating proof of all the tests . We 're asking ourselves " Where are they ? " They 're right there . They 're right under our noses . I 'm giving you the chance to change that . To hold the proof . Why me and why now ? I wanna damn the soul of that cigarette-smoking son of a bitch . Mulder ? Even the military satellites don 't see it . JPL 'S TOPEX / Poseidon shows it only as waveform data . It appears as a micro-burst of transmission error on the European Space Agency 's ERS-2 . - In other words ? - In other words , you 'd never know it 's a UFO . If you didn 't know what you were looking at or for . - No wonder we couldn 't see them . - It won 't be there for ever . As we all stand here talking , it 's rebuilding itself . If this is true ... - If it is or if it isn 't , forget about it . - Forget about it ? You 're not going back out there . I 'm not gonna let you . - What are you talking about ? - It has to and some time . - That time is now . - Mulder ... Scully , you have to understand that they 're taking abductees . You 're an abductee . I 'm not gonna risk ... losing you . I won 't let you go alone . - This feels like the snipe hunt I was afraid of . - There 's no such thing as a snipe . My ass is on the line here too . I know that . - This just can 't be . - What are you looking at ? Medical records . Billy Miles and other known abductees in Bellefleur , Oregon . - They all had anomalous brain activity . - Electroencephalitic trauma . Which is what Mulder experienced earlier this year . - I don 't understand . - There was something out there in that field . It knocked me back . Because it didn 't want me . Mulder thinks that it 's me that 's in danger of being taken . When it 's Mulder who 's in danger . - Scully ? - Whoa ! You OK ? How 's it supposed to work ? Not exactly sure , sir . But ... budgetarily , I 'd say we 're looking pretty good . Agent Mulder ? ! Mulder ! Mulder ! Mulder . We 've failed , then . Perhaps you never meant to succeed . Anyway ... the hour is at hand , I presume . - What are you doing ? - Sending the devil back to hell . As you do to Mulder and to me ... you do to all of mankind , Alex . Agent Scully . How are you feeling ? I 'm feeling fine . They 're just running some tests on me . I already heard . I lost him . I don 't know what else I can say . I lost him . I 'll be asked ... what I saw . And what I saw , I can 't deny . I won 't . We will find him . I have to . Sir ... there 's something else I need to tell you . Something that I need for you to keep to yourself . I 'm having a hard time explaining it . Or believing it . But ... I 'm pregnant . I made this !

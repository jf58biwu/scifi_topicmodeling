 Previously on The Pretender . Enough ! We don 't want him dead . [ Tires Screeching ] Nice to meet you , Jarod . I 'm Zoe . - [ Jarod ] I want to stay with you . - [ Zoe ] I know . But you can 't stay , can you ? I can see it in your eyes . [ Jarod ] Edna Raines knows things about your mother , Miss Parker . I need to talk to you about your mother and Mirage . It could be a matter of life and death . [ Sydney ] Edna Raines is dead . She knew all the secrets , especially about the Mirage Project . [ Miss Parker ] Jarod 's e-mail said to keep digging . It 's your mother 's grave . Miss Parker , your mother - she 's not here . Then where the hell is she ? Oh , come on . Everybody 's been on at least one vacation . I swear , Zoe , I 've never been on vacation . Not even , uh , Mount Rushmore ? - The Alamo ? - Mm-mmm . What about Niagara Falls ? I definitely would have remembered that . Wait , I did eat at a " Stookey 's " off of I-65 once . Does that count ? " Stuckey 's . " Only if you bought the pecan log . - What 's a pecan log ? - Oh , you really have never had a vacation , have you ? Who needs a vacation ... when I have you ? You swear to me you 're in total remission ? Yeah . I probably pissed off a few H.M.O. ' s , but what the hell ? - Zoe - - Hey . You 're not going all mushy on me , are you ? - [ Ringing ] - [ Electronic Voice ] You have a video phone call . That 's my video phone . - Um , I 'll be right back . - Okay . [ Ringing Continues ] - Hello , Son . - Oh , my God ! Dad ! I 've been searching for you for over a year . Where have you been ? I know . The boy and I had to go underground for a while . We kept searching for you too , but with no luck ... until an anonymous tip came my way . I was able to unscramble your password , which got me into you here . - Then you 're both okay ? - Thank God the boy and I are both well . - The boy ? - He 's sort of like my brother . I 'll - I 'll explain it to you sometime . Dad , this is Zoe . - Zoe , this is my dad . - Jarod 's been pretty damn worried about you , sir . He 's cute . What happened to you ? When can I see you ? We have to be careful . I don 't trust the security of this line ... so I 'll make it quick . Jarod , I found Emily . I found your sister . What ? How ? Where is she ? She 's a reporter at the Philadelphia Examiner . For security 's sake ... I 've left vital information about her where abouts on your secured e-mail . She told me that recently , she was very close to finding you . She cried when I told her I knew how to reach you . I think you should go to her . - Will you bring her back to me , Jarod ? - Yes ! - Yes , of course I will . - Good luck , Son . Keep me posted . My - I found my dad . Um - My - I-We 've been looking for my sister for so long ... and now I found her , and I can , uh - Um-What about our trip ? It can wait . We 'll have time . And if I have any say in the matter , lots of it . You 're not gettin ' all mushy on me , are you ? Go find your sister . [ Man ] Somebody call 911 ! [ Woman ] She 's in the alley ! - What happened ? - A reporter was attacked . - They say she was thrown out of that window . - A reporter ? An Emily something . Emily ? Emily ! Emily ? Emily ? - Please help me . - That 's what I 'm here to do . I 'm going to help you . I 'm Jarod . I 'm your brother . - Jarod . - Stay with me . Stay with me . - [ Gasps , Coughs ] - Emily ? Emily ? Somebody call an ambulance ! [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . - [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . - [ Jarod ] Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . - Pupils are unresponsive . Respiration is shallow at 40 . - Pulse is weak and thready . Probable closed head injury with internal bleeding and multiple fractures . Keep her head stabilized . Start an I.V. drip and run a C.B.C. Page Radiology . We need an abdominal and head CAT scan , stat . - Who initiated C.P.R. ? - I did . Your actions may have saved her life . Are you a doctor ? No . [ Jarod ] I 'm with the F.B.I. - The victim is someone we 've had our eye on for sometime now . - Why ? Let 's just say that a few of her journalistic choices have struck a nerve in D.C. The victim 's office is in here . Name 's Detective Brookins . Call me Stan . Agent Jarod Curtis . Tell me what you know , the whole story . Well , the victim came to the office early this morning . So early , it was the night shift janitor that probably saved her life by walking in . Anyway , from what I can tell , the woman was ambushed here ... then thrown out this window two stories to the pavement . - Any description ? - White male , 35-ish , average build , dark suit . Got the sketch artist workin ' on it now . I want all of her files boxed and sealed and sent to your precinct . And I 'm also gonna need an office for a few days . [ Miss Parker ] Well , it 's about time you got back , Lyle . So , what 's the flavor of the day , little brother ? Mail-order mamas from Malaysia ? Or cannibal quiche from the Kalahari ? - If you 're here to talk with our father , he 's gone . - Well , then find him . [ Chuckles ] Pounding boilermakers is hardly the breakfast of champions . This isn 't about you . I 'm sorry . Okay , now I know you 're sloshed . What 's going on , Parker ? [ Sighs ] It 's - It 's about our mother . She 's gone . - Our mother 's been dead a long time . - No . I mean , she 's not there . I mean , her - She 's not there ? What do you mean she 's not there , Parker ? Parker ? You wouldn 't understand anyway . - But I wanna know . - Bet you do . [ Electronic Female Voice ] Message voice box 04 . Record . - [ Beeps ] - It 's me . I 've got a bad feeling Miss Parker knows about Catherine 's empty grave . [ Sydney ] You believe someone stole your mother 's body ? Except for this scotch-induced earthquake rattling between my ears ... I 'm not sure exactly what to believe anymore . Let 's face it , Sydney . Catherine Parker 's body being gone ... fits in with all the other bizarre happenings around here . The reappearance of Edna Raines who , after 30 years , everyone thought was dead . And who now really is dead , thanks to the bald butcher she called " Hubby . " The murder of that harmless clerk Leonard down in SL 26 ... because he just happened to see the wrong memo . And now , Catherine Parker 's empty grave . That 's a lot of strange coincidences . No . Not coincidence . Mirage . Mirage ? You mean what Edna Raines told you before she died ? What was on both of those memos , the one I found on Lyle 's desk ... and the one that killed that clerk . Well , oddities , yes ... but status quo here at the Centre . I never thought I 'd hear you say ... " Murder is business as usual , " Syd . All I 'm saying is , at times ... it is best to let some things go . My mother 's grave is empty , Sydney . Maybe , just maybe , she had otherwishes that you didn 't know about . For her burial , I mean . People sometimes make choices ... that are difficult to explain . No . This is one big fish I 'm reeling in . Broots , our best evidence - We follow the body . In this case , my mother 's . We start with the autopsy records . Parker ? Why won 't you let go of this ? Because something inside me is telling me to do this . And I 'm listening . Her condition is only fair , Agent Curtis . - So please minimize your time with her . - I will . Thank you . Em ? It 's your brother ... Jarod . I was too late this morning . I 'm sorry . But I 'll never be late again . I promise you . [ Lyle ] How goes the world tour ? Indeference to Winston Churchill ... or whoever the hell said it ... " The sun never sets on the Centre . " And I 'm making sure it never sets on the Parkers either . - [ Elevator Bell Dings ] - Glad to hear it . Since when is Raines hosting Triumvirate personnel ? He 'll be a blip on our radar as long as everything goes well with Mirage . Unfortunately , we 've got company there . I 've all but confirmed that Sis is on that same track . - Ah , damn . - Oh , it 's nothing . She 's way behind the curve . I 'll make sure she stays there . I don 't want her knowing for her own good . Hell , if she knew the truth , she 'd only wish she didn 't . - Okay . - [ Crunch ] - God ! What 'd I just step in ? - I don 't know . - But if you hurry , you can still catch it . - Ew ! [ Sydney ] I can 't believe you actually found Catherine Parker 's autopsy files , Broots . Well , I haven 't found it yet . But , according to Buzzie ... the only way to download a visual archive in the Sublevel ... is to tap directly into the Sublevel 's mainframe terminals . - Who the hell is Buzzie ? - My pal down in Communications . You know the old guy with the hearing aids ? He 's always griping about the constant ringing in his ears . - I 've got that problem myself . - Get this . You know the rumor that J.F.K. was kept alive as a vegetable somewhere ? Buzzie claims it was right here in SL 18 . Yeah , right next door to the alien corpses Nixon showed Jackie Gleason . - That was here too ? - [ Sydney ] Hey ! This is Room 12 . This is it . [ Broots ] Wow . This is the room where they did your mother 's autopsy . - This shouldn 't take long . - [ Zipper Unzipping ] Sydney ? - Parker , you okay ? - Fine , Syd . - I got it . - [ Raines ] This begins the visual data archive ... to be known as number 566773 . The autopsy of Catherine Elaine Parker . Date and time to follow . Dr. William Raines , M.E. Versatile guy , that Raines . Beats ' em , bursts them , slices and dices . [ Raines ] Initial findings indicate ... a single gunshot wound into the cranial region as cause of death . Angle and force of the head wound ... strongly indicate the gunshot was self-inflicted . - [ Drill Whirring ] - Let 's just skip to the end , Broots . Oh , God . We 've heard all these lies before . I just need to see where the body goes . Box the body for transport per the family wishes . On a personal note , I would simply like to go on record to express my heartfelt remorse ... and to say that this is and will always be ... a tragic death in the annals of the Centre ... the likes of which I hope never to encounter again . So , what now ? We do a little exploratory surgery of our own ... see just how remorseful Dr. Death really is . [ Man ] I 'm as sorry as I can be about the attack on Emily . I wish all my tenants were like her . I sort of connected with her right off - her lookin ' for her family ... me not ever knowing my father and mother . I 'm sorry . She was so close to changing all that for herself . - What do you mean ? - Well , she was hot on the trail of her brother . Said she was , like , this close to finding him . She 'd tear up everytime she talked about it . When was the last time that you saw my - uh , the victim ? Um , must have been a couple of nights ago . To tell you the truth , she seemed a little tense . Said something about being , uh , close to a big discovery . The brother that she was looking for ? I-I don 't think so . This was something disturbing to her . It wasn 't a happy discovery . Did you find something ? I 'm not sure . Uh , thank you for your time ... but I 'd like to look around for a little bit . Sure . Hey , you saved me a trip . I was about to go into town and tell the police about this guy that was hanging around here . It-It was the same guy from the police sketch in the evening paper . I-I can 't believe they left out the most important part of the description . What 's that ? The fact that - Well , the guy was missing a thumb . - [ Women Laughing ] - [ Lyle ] I 've never even met you . Who said anything about breakfast ? Mr. Lyle ? Something tells me you haven 't read the morning 's paper . You try to kill with kindness , and this is what happens . Put a team together . We 're goin ' back to Philly A.S.A.P. Right . Allow me . I 'm not going to Sublevel 18 . Oh . But you should . It 's a regular " Freaks-R-Us " down there . You know the history . J.F.K .. , dead Martians . The room where you did my mother 's autopsy . It 's gonna be a bitch gettin that tank up and down the stairs . It 's common knowledge I performed your mother 's autopsy . But ... is it common knowledge ... that my mother 's body isn 't in her grave ? What are you talking about ? What the hell did you do with her body , you ghoul ? What any responsible medical examiner would have done - honor the wishes of the deceased . If you have a problem with that , take it up with her ... because this discussion is over . Miss Parker , you told him about your mother 's empty grave ? He 's gonna - He could - He could - He could lead us right to the answer . [ Broots ] You told him on purpose . That fish I said I 'd be reeling in - I just baited the hook . Now we troll . - You with us , Syd ? - [ Elevator Bell Dings ] [ Woman ] I 'm sorry , Agent Curtis ... but I cannot in good conscience allow the victim to be transferred . How would your conscience feel when they put you in jail for violation of a federal order ? - That order is worthless in my eyes . - I have seen her charts . Her edema levels are back to normal , as well as hervital signs . - The answer 's still no . - Whoever tried to kill her knows he failed ... and he will be back to finish the job , I guarantee you that . Releasing her to the next of kin would be my only option here . And correct me if I 'm wrong ... but so far , none have turned up . Until now . I 'm Emily 's father ... and I think you should give the agent here what he wants . I 'll prep her for immediate release . - It 's so good to see you . - How is she ? - She 's going to be okay . - Great . [ Tires Screeching ] Check over there . Willie , stairs . You , follow me . - How many were there ? - Four . Go ! Go ! 238 . Damn ! Where did she go ? - Released . She just went downstairs . - Take the stairs . That ambulance over there is mine . I know a place that we can be safe . You drive . Good way to get yourself killed , pal . Out of my way . - See this woman come this way anywhere ? - Nope . Never seen her . [ Siren Wailing ] Damn ! I wanna thank you , Sister Mary , for everything you 've done for us . After all you 've done for our parish , Jarod ... - you just stay as long as you want . - [ Bells Tolling ] And we 'll take very good care of Emily . Nothing . - No luck , huh ? - It 's like he doesn 't exist . Well , whoever this guy is , Emily 's been tracking him for a while . Here , let me give you a hand with the notes . " Misplaced personality disorder . " " Man with no name . " " Talks to voices . " " Enigma . " Maybe it 's a story she 's been working on . Or a lifelong mystery she 's been trying to solve . She thought this guy might have been you . She 's been searching , just like me . Just like ... we all have . Why would the Centre want to murder her ? And how does he fit in ? [ Broots ] Boy , you put the worm on ... and he took it hook , line and sinker . Man . But I never pegged Raines for the rustic type . In the middle of nowhere , you can 't hear anyone scream . I need to get to that fire . [ Miss Parker ] Anything , Broots ? Looks like a Raines time capsule . Everything from old mortgage papers to his kid 's kindergarten artwork . Move over , Monet . Looks like " Ethan . " His son ? I 've tried not to fire too many synapses remembering things about the Raines family . You think Raines used to live here ? Well , we used to visit his house occasionally ... but it was on the other side of town . Maybe he used this place as some kind of personal storage depot . Yeah . Well , no offense against his kid 's artwork ... but this is starting to feel like a dead-end trip down memory lane . Miss Parker ? I think another street just opened up . Huh . St. Christopher medal . Miss Parker , look . [ Emily Moans ] Emily ? Emily ? Hi . It 's me , Em . It 's your brother . - Jarod ? - Dad 's here too . We 're all together now . [ Mutters ] Take your time . Take your time . What is it you wanna tell us ? I found this picture in your research files . You thought he was me , didn 't you ? Who is he ? Ethan . - Ethan ? - He hears the voices . Talks - He talks to the voices . I read that in your notebook . What voices , Emily ? Hey , I think she should rest . Come on . Okay . NuGenesis . NuGenesis ? My God . The Centre Fertility Clinic ? I have no fond memories of that place . Here . " AA8585 . " Is that a file number ? - From NuGenesis ? - Does that have anything to do with this man Ethan ? Follow NuGenesis . Follow him . Follow him . Emily ? Emily ? You know , if you consider yourself any kind of friend of hers ... you 'll destroy those disks . - And you will destroy it now ! - But I can 't ! I can 't , Sydney . I don 't really have a choice in the matter , do I ? I mean , this is Miss Parker 's life . - This is her past . She has every right to see it . - See what ? Do what you must , Broots . But I won 't be a part of opening this Pandora 's box . [ Miss Parker ] What Pandora 's box ? [ Broots ] I was able to reconstruct one tiny piece of the disks ... we found at Raines 's forest house . - The same place we were today ? - Yeah , but - Just watch . [ Raines ] I hope you 're feeling comfortable here , Catherine ... after all you 've been through . I never thought I 'd see the day when I 'd be thanking you for your kindness , Dr. Raines . But thank you . - My mother was there . - Yeah . But what 's important is the date . Look . Look at the date code on the D.S.A. Your mother was shot and killed at the Centre in April . - This says June . There must be a mis - - No . It 's physically and technically impossible ... to alter the dates on the Centre D.S.A. surveillance system . Sydney didn 't want me to show you this . I don 't know why . But it 's a lock . Your mother did not die in that elevator , Miss Parker . Are - Are you saying my mother is still alive ? Your mother alive ? Does this make any sense ? - Do you think that was hers ? - I don 't remember it , but anything 's possible . Keep decoding the forest house archives . And don 't tell anyone . - Not even Sydney ? - Especially Sydney . He 's done everything except handcuff me to a freight train ... to keep me from digging into this . There must be someone you can trust . Where 's Angelo ? Looks like the same kind of insanity I grew up with . Are you sure this is the address Emily gave us for Ethan ? Positive . He 's been videotaping himself for years . Is there anything on NuGenesis AA8585 ? Nope . But there 's enough material here to write a dissertation on bomb-making . But this guy 's taken it a step further . He 's designing his own bomb . Huh . Look . There 's an unmailed letter ... to his parents , the Clausens . According to this time code , this video was made less than one hour ago . There 's your little bomb-maker . Let 's see what he 's been up to . Just leave me alone ! - Who 's he talking to ? - I know I shouldn 't yell . I won 't be bad anymore . According to Emily 's notes ... there were signs of erratic behavior , of multiple personalities . He must be wrestling with some kind of demons inside . Emily said he could hear the voices , whatever that means . [ Phone Ringing ] Yeah ? Hey , hey , listen . I 'm in trouble . I need to talk to you . Yes , I 'm-I 'm almost ready with 7677 . I-I just need a few more components . But I 'm tellin ' you , I need to talk . You swear that after the explosion ... the pain will be gone ? They 're promising him his inner torture will end if he pulls off some kind of bombing for them . - The Centre . - Who else ? Okay , I 'll do it . First , I wanna see my mom and dad . Why won 't you let me see my mom and dad ? It 's been so long . I-I-I wrote them a letter . Why can 't I send it ? They do love me ! I know . I know you do too . [ Line Disconnects , Dial Tone ] [ Grunts ] - What ? Are you sure ? - What 's he doing ? - He 's talking to the voices . - He 's gonna - He 's gonna hurt my mom and dad ? He can 't hurt my mom and dad . [ Major Charles ] Wherever he 's going , he 's not coming back ... and he 's taking his bomb with him . Come on . Let 's go . It 's not my fault that Jarod found his sister before the Sweeper team did . It 's your fault she was still alive . Well , what did you teach me about water under the bridge ? If it gets deep enough , it 'll drown you . What about Mirage ? - We 're still searching . - Oh , that 's perfect . My daughter is searching for a ghost ... my son is searching for a monster . Last one alive wins , hmm ? [ Angelo ] Secrets and lies . Secrets and lies . When it comes to the Centre , Angelo , secrets and lies are like oxygen . Lies . Angelo , I need you to empath this for me . It may have belonged to my mother . Your mother wore this . Her journey not over . My mother is still out there ? Illusions are real . What 's that mean ? Mirages are real . What 's " Mirage , " Angelo ? Mirages are real . Tell me what that means ! Miss Parker . He - He 's on your side . Angelo sorry . He doesn 't know the answers . But Sydney knows . Sydney knows all the secrets and lies . [ Sobbing ] Oh , please . Please don 't be dead . Please . [ Sobbing ] Don 't leave me . - Please don 't leave . Please . - [ Voices Whispering ] You did this . No , I swear I didn 't do this . You hurt them ! Why ? Why ? Ethan , I didn 't hurt them . I swear to you . I did not kill them . - [ Voices Whispering ] - Somebody hurt them . Somebody killed my parents . Please , let me help you . - Help ? - My sister Emily ... - she followed you because she wanted to help you . - [ Sirens Wailing ] - That 's all I want to do . - There 's no help for me . - [ Tires Screeching ] - Not from you . There 's only one person who can help me now . Ethan ! Ethan ! - Freeze ! - I 'm F.B.I. It 's okay . It 's okay . F.B.I. - There were reports of shots fired . - Upstairs . Two bodies . I was too late . You knew my mother was alive , but you didn 't tell me ? Yes . Then give me one good reason not to blow your Flemish brains out . I promised her I wouldn 't tell you . [ Sighs ] Well , as you know ... I gave your mother her last psychiatric session ... less than an hour before her supposed murder . - Supposed suicide in the elevator . - " Supposed . " What does that mean , Sydney ? Catherine ? Catherine , please relax . Sydney , I just found out that someone I love is planning to kill me . - Who ? - I can 't tell you . A friend . But it 's forcing me to - to make a very difficult decision . I 'm going to stage my death in hopes of saving my life . - I don 't understand . - And I don 't have time to explain it all . But you know these people , what they 're capable of . I try not to imagine . Their latest is a project called Mirage ... and they 've made me a key player . My only way out is dying , by their hands or my own . [ Sydney ] This is dangerous talk . These are dangerous times , Sydney . I 'll do what I have to to survive . And then I 'll come back and rescue Jarod and Angelo and my little girl . What about your little girl ? She 's my gift from God ... and I don 't know how to save her without causing her this pain . Promise me , Sydney . Swear to me that you 'll protect her ... that you 'll never tell her about this . - You owe me . - I know I do . Whatever happens , no matter how badly she wants to know ... I don 't want my baby girl to ever have to face the true tragedy ... of her family 's secret . - Promise me . - I promise . Godspeed , Catherine . An hour later , the gunshot rang out . You know the rest . I never saw Catherine again . - Do you know what it is ? - What ? Mirage . The tragedy ... of my family 's secret ? I 'm afraid I don 't . That is the truth . Ethan 's parents were murdered as a message to him . Finish the 7677 bombing , or else . Sounds like a message from the Centre to me . - That has the Centre fingerprints all over it . - This too . - You hacked into the NuGenesis mainframe ? - Uh-huh . And you won 't believe what I found in file number AA8585 . [ Jarod ] AA8585 was a shipment ... of cryogenically frozen sperm samples . They were airlifted to the Centre decades ago . Someone wanted to get pregnant pretty badly . Yeah , but they weren 't just anyone 's samples , Jarod . They were mine . - How much does Jarod know ? - [ Lyle ] We 're not sure . But Major Charles 's seminal records have been compromised at NuGenesis . [ Lyle ] And there 's more . Jarod was spotted at the parents ' house . - Before or after they were killed ? - After , thank God . - And Mirage ? - [ Sighs ] He 's still out there . There 's gotta be some way to get to Jarod before he beats us to him . There is one . We give him something ... more important to go after . Something named Zoe . [ Mr. Parker ] Good thinking , Mr. Cox . [ Major Charles ] It only gets stranger and stranger . - More on your records at NuGenesis ? - Yeah . For the past 25 years , comparative genetic test follow-ups ... have been conducted using my D.N.A. The question is , who or what are they comparing it to ? It doesn 't say . But the results were sent to a private residence ... in Blue Cove , Delaware . Come on . [ Engine Starts ] Okay , let 's go . You all right ? Something feels ... weird . - We 're talkin ' Mr. Raines . It 's supposed to be weird . - No . This is weirder than him . - What are we lookin ' for ? - The truth . I 'll check over here . No . It 's not over there . How do you know , Son ? I just know . It 's - It 's like a strange deja vu . - What are you mumbling about ? - I decoded some of the archives from the forest house . And , well , if a picture 's worth more than a thousand words ... I think I 've just uncovered a thesaurus . This is about six months after your mother supposedly died . - Well ? - He 'll be here in a few minutes . - You sure you wanna do this ? - [ Sighs ] I have to . - What ? What did she have to do ? - Well , wait . Just watch that door . Like you 've seen this place before ? It 's like I 've been here before . [ Gasps ] Oh , my God . Jarod out of the Centre ? Impossible . How could that be ? Secrets and lies . - Hi , Jarod . - Hello , Mrs. Parker . Thank you for coming . Close the door . Gynecological instruments ? What is all this stuff ? Tools of the trade . - A birthing table ? - The question is , whose ? Come here , Jarod . There 's something I wanna tell you . My mother was pregnant ? You 're going to have a brother . [ Major Charles ] This is just too weird . Birthing tables , incubators ... genetic follow-ups of my semen . Are you thinking what I 'm thinking ? I have a brother . I have a brother ? Jarod and I share a brother ? It must be Ethan . - But where is he ? - [ Ethan ] My parents are gone . Mom is dead . Dad is dead . [ Raines ] I 'm your father now . [ Sydney ] Details are sketchy , Jarod . I 'm just now trying to piece a lot of this together myself . This feeling is so strong , Sydney , that I 've been to that forest house before . But my mind wants to block it out . I have a feeling too , Jarod , and it says you 're lying . - Miss Parker . - I 'm glad to hear your mind hasn 't blocked me out yet . Tell him , Syd . Like he doesn 't know . Well , we saw the D.S.A. , and you were definitely there . - Then why don 't I remember it ? - [ Miss Parker ] You 're the genius . - You tell us . - If I could I would , Miss Parker . You know that . I 've never held back when it comes to your mother . [ Miss Parker ] You were on the D.S.A. , Jarod . She talked to you . - She told you secrets . - I don 't remember . - Did she tell you why she faked her own death ? - I don 't know . Or how in the hell that baby she was carrying is your brother ? - Look , I don 't know . - Or where she was going , or where the baby went , or - I don 't know ! [ Sydney ] It is entirely possible that ... your subconscious mind has blocked out those recollections , Jarod ... either by itself or with the help of someone else . So those memories could still be in Jarod 's head ? Every waking moment of our lives is stored somewhere in our minds . [ Jarod ] Well , for what it 's worth , Miss Parker , I believe that - that our brother is a man named Ethan . Now , I don 't know where he is ... but somehow he 's involved with a project called 7677 . You figure out 7677 .. you find baby brother . [ Ethan ] I 'm almost ready with 7677 . I just need a few more components . But I 'm telling you , I need to talk . Okay . [ Grunts ] Still nothin ' on this guy , Agent ? - Still nothing . - [ Man ] You can 't drag me out of my house like that ! I got a whole grilled cheese goin ' right there on the stove . Hey , where do you want him , Detective ? - Come on ! - [ Brookins ] Ask , and ye shall receive . That 's the local munitions guy you asked us to haul in . Name 's Jed Sidel . Small-time middle man , all-around weasel . Well , what a coincidence . Weasel season has just opened . Jed . - Agent Curtis , F.B.I. - Hello . On behalf of the Bureau , I would like to say congratulations . - Hmm ? - Well , you 're moving up in the world . - I am ? - Aiding and abetting in the making ofbombs . Helping to murder innocent citizens . I mean , this is hardly fencing stolen TVs . You 're hittin ' the big leagues . Your parents must bevery proud of you . - You got the wrong guy . - Really ? Well , he doesn 't seem to think so . I don 't know who that is . - That wasn 't my question . - What-What-What was the question ? Why are you helping your friend here make bombs ? - No , no . Ethan ain 't no friend of mine . - Ethan ? I thought you didn 't know him . Do you have any idea what this guy 's gonna do to me if I spill to you ? I mean , he talks to people that aren 't even there . He 's crazy . Unlike the lovable lifers in federal prison . - Hmm ? - I hear shower time 's a real scream , Jed . Explosives . Yes . He was looking for explosives . Like C-4 , Semtex , uh , digital fuses . And all I did , and this is all I did ... was call a guy on the phone , and I - and I set up a meeting . - That 's it . - Where and when ? Mm-hmm . At the warehouse at midnight . Broad Street and Franklin . [ Engine Starts ] There was only about one minute of stuff left on the D.S.A. But what 's there is really telling . Dr. Raines , leave us alone , please ? Catherine , I don 't think that would be a good idea . I think it would be a great idea . Jarod , there 's something I have to tell you ... that you can never forget . Okay . I may not live much longer , and if I don 't ... there 's something very important I want you to tell my daughter . Will you promise me that you 'll tell her ? I promise . It 's something I don 't ever want anyone else to hear . What 's wrong , Broots ? Fix it . Well , there 's nothing to fix . She unplugged it . That 's all there is . My butt that 's all there is . Make it talk . - I-I can 't . - My mother 's dying secret . The one thing she wanted me to know ... is not only lost electronically , but somewhere inside Jarod 's head ... and he can 't remember a thing . Hmm . Raines . Raines must have erased that portion of Jarod 's brain . - You mean , like , hypnotized him or brainwashed him or something ? - Very likely . I don 't know how Raines locked that memory in Genius Boy 's mind ... but I 'm gonna free it up if I have to crack his head open ... and carve it out with a melon scooper . - How are we gonna do that ? - We track Raines . I 'll bet my ass he knows where Ethan is . We find Ethan , we find Jarod . Move in , Sam ! [ Chattering ] Relax , son . Everything 's going to be just fine . I feel so alone . But you 're not , Ethan . I 'm here for you . You know that , don 't you ? After you earn the trust of the Triumvirate with the bombing ... you 'll come to live at the Centre where we 'll do great things together . I 'll be calling you soon . [ Door Opens , Closes ] Ethan ? It 's okay . I 'm not here to hurt you . No , you 're the one who killed my parents . I didn 't kill your parents . [ Voices Whispering ] How do you know I can trust him ? I can 't trust anyone . Not you , not him . Ethan , I 'm your friend . - [ Chain Rattling ] - Ethan , run ! Run ! [ Gunshot ] [ Miss Parker ] Jarod ! Damn it ! Jarod ! Your ninth life just ran out . [ Miss Parker ] You look surprised to be here . Well , I 'm surprised I 'm still alive . Dead men tell no tales . I 'm assuming since we 're here , this has nothing to do with Centre business ? No . It 's about me . I need your help . Tell me what I need to know , and you 're out of here . And I should believe you 're going to let me just walk away ? Hmm ? Watch this , Jarod . - [ Young Jarod ] Hello , Mrs. Parker . - Thank you for coming . Close the door . Come here , Jarod . There 's something I wanna tell you . You 're going to have a brother . [ Jarod ] I don 't remember this . Sydney , I don 't remember this . [ Sydney ] It 's in your mind somewhere . Then let 's get it out . Three , two , one . Go back into your memory , Jarod ... to when you were a young boy . Are you there now ? Go back to a moment when Raines came to take you from the Centre . And where did he take you ? [ Jarod ] A house in the woods . - Can you see the house now ? - Yes . Go inside . - Are you there ? - Yes . I smell wood . Wood paneling . Cedar . Very good , Jarod . I walk through a sliding door . - She 's there . - Who is ? Catherine Parker . She 's still alive . Hi , Jarod . She didn 't die in the elevator . - She seems troubled . - By what ? She wants me ... to tell her daughter something very important . What ? It 's very important that she know the truth about Ethan . Ethan ? That 's what he told me his name would be . I don 't understand . How would he know ? - How do you ? - I call it my inner sense . Inner sense ? For most , it 's the hairs on the back of your neck ... or that nervous feeling in your stomach . [ Jarod , Mrs. Parker Together ] For me , it 's voices I hear all around me ... usually warning me of things that are about to happen . Like souls talking to you ? Something like that . I 've been blessed with this gift , Jarod . And though she doesn 't know it , so has my daughter . Though neither of us quite like Ethan . Ijust pray his gift isn 't abused by the wrong people . [ Young Jarod ] Why are you telling me this ? Because Ethan is also your brother . Unknown to me , while I was sedated ... for a minor surgery not long ago ... my husband ... used your father 's seed to impregnate me . - My father 's genetics . - Yes . Mr. Parker wanted to create a child ... with this inner sense ... who could also be special like you are ... to use , no doubt , as they have used you . Mr. Raines showed me proof of what had been done ... and that Mr. Parker is planning to kill me ... when the baby is born . [ Young Jarod ] Mr. Raines scares me . Why do you trust him ? I trusted him because - because he trusted me . That and ... it was the only way for me to give this child a chance at a real life . But now - Something 's wrong . The voices are telling me I won 't leave this house alive . [ Young Jarod ] That 's why you brought me here . You 're special , Jarod , and I know you won 't forget . I want you to tell my daughter to complete my plan . [ Young Jarod ] Plan ? She 'll understand one day . Just tell her to trust her inner sense . It will guide her actions . Jarod , your soul is a trusting one , just like your mother 's . - You know my mother ? - Yes . And one day , you 'll be back together again . And Ethan will help you find her . [ Jarod , Mrs. Parker Together ] Trust your inner sense . [ Typing ] - Mr. Lyle . - Any news from Cox about Zoe ? According to his last message , he 's ready . But this is why I 'm here . Our people at Triumvirate Headquarters ... thought you might find that quite interesting . Raines has been a busy boy . [ Broots ] I intercepted a communique between Raines and the Triumvirate ... and I 'm probably not the only one who did . - Spit it out , Broots . - It 's about 7677 . And that thing , that Mirage - That " thing " is my brother . Whoa . Okay . In a nutshell , there 's some project called 7677 . And if it goes off as planned , Mr. Raines is gonna be in charge of the Centre . A Raines coup . Thank you . Hello ? Why do I feel like you know what Broots just told me ? - Raines has been working towards this his whole sordid career . - Using Ethan . He took him as a child , placed him in a surrogate family ... with people who would allow Raines to control his emotions . In other words , screwed him up so badly , he would only trust Raines . So Raines could have total control over him ... turn Ethan into his private assassin . And when Raines killed his surrogate parents ... he severed all emotional ties to anything connected with the outside world . [ Jarod ] Well , that is what Raines does best - take people away from their families . What are you going to do ? [ Sighs ] I don 't know . Do what your mother would have wanted . Finish her work . Work she died trying to accomplish . My mother may still be alive , Jarod . What if she 's not ? You can stop Raines . I don 't know ! Ow ! Trust your inner sense , Miss Parker . I do . Now ... I 'm going to find my - our brother . Have I ever told you ... how truly inspired this Holy Roller gag of yours has been ? What are you talking about ? Oh , come on . You 're about as born-again as I am . But , hey , after you botched things so badly last year ... this religion thing saved your ass . There 's no shame in that . Of course ... the way the Triumvirate 's been touting you lately , who needs divine intervention ? - You 're making no sense . - Oh , I am . Just as much as this communique that I intercepted from the Triumvirate does . You 've gotten pretty tight with our bosses in Africa . 7677 and Mirage . Your power play . Ringin ' a bell ? How did you get this ? If you can find God , I can sure as hell find that . And to think all this time , I thought Bobby Bowman ... was your only special project on the outside . I guess you never heard of progress . What I 'm about to propose is all about progress . - What do you want ? - I want to run the Centre with you . The 7677 bombing goes down ... Mirage - or is it Ethan - comes into the Centre just like you promised the Triumvirate ... and it all can happen because I decide ... not to tell Mr. Parker that you stole his son . Yeah . That you stole his prizes Project Mirage . Now , if I read that communique correctly ... it 's about time for you to activate Ethan ... and finish 7677 . What do you say , partner ? [ Ringing ] [ Raines ] 7677 is a go . This is your final call . After this , it 's up to you . Now , walk three blocks to the bus station . Open locker number 9 ... and you 'll find the final instructions for the bombing . [ Voices Whispering ] We couldn 't stop him now even if we wanted to . Happy ? - [ Door Opens ] - Damn happy . - You son of a - - Hey , hey . Is that any way to talk to your new partner ? Whoops . I mean , new boss ? [ Man ] We have a clean trace on the call . We 'll monitor Ethan until he finishes 7677 , and then we 'll bring him in . - No screw-ups . - Lock him up down in SL 25 ... with the rats . We 've had too many years and too much success for things to end this way . Who said it 's ending for me ? # [ Man Singing ] # [ Singing Along ] - # [ Continues ] - Excuse me ? Hi . Anything I can do to help ? As a matter offact , there is . # [ Continues ] [ Bells Tolling ] - Hi . - Hi . - How are you feeling ? - Better . We have so much we have to catch up on . I 'm going to find Mom ... and we 're all going to be together like one big family . And what about Ethan ? Dad told me everything . He 's not crazy ... not like you thought he was . Our brother , he 's gifted . He 's special . Don 't let them destroy Ethan like they did our family . I won 't . I promise . Sweet dreams . Why the glum looks ? Well , I recovered more of the forest house archives . - And ? - Sit down , Parker . [ Raines ] I can see the head , Catherine . [ Groaning ] - It 's a - - [ Mrs. Parker ] Boy . [ Raines ] You 're right . It is a boy . Oh ! Hello , Ethan . Hello . I 'm your mother . I have such big plans foryou . - Why didn 't you want me to see this ? - There 's more , I 'm afraid . After my work was through , I wanted to raise you and your brother and sister ... like a real family . But I 'm not gonna be able to do that , little man . I just realized I 'm not going to be able to seeyou grow up . But you have a brother and sister that will find you and protect you . You tell them to finish my work ... to finish my plan . I love you . [ Crying ] - Um , I don 't think you need to see - - No . I need to know . I 'm sorry . I 'm just following orders . [ Mrs. Parker ] You really had me convinced that you had changed ... that you cared about this baby . There 's no other way , Catherine . [ Gunshot ] Raines just executed her . [ Baby Crying ] - Have her cremated . - Yes , Doctor . I 'm your mommy now . Raines executed my mother . He won 't take my brother too . Syd , talk to her . There 's nothing left to say . [ Major Charles ] You found Ethan 's computer ? At the warehouse where he picked up the bomb components . I reconstructed the hard drive and was able to break down the bomb schematic . But even better , I found out where the bombing is going down . 7677 . It 's the number of a subway train . - D.C. Underground . - The subway 's not his target . It 's his delivery system . Train 7677 's route ends at Freedom Station . Directly above that is the National Hotel . The exact place where hundreds of foreign dignitaries are staying for a peace conference . So much for peace . I broke down the password on a well-hidden encryption file . Ethan 's programmed the bomb 's timer on this laptop too . The train is leaving the station in exactly one hour from now . - It 's just enough time to stop this and save Ethan . - Come on . - [ Ringing ] - [ Electronic Voice ] You have a video phone call . I 'm sorry to call so late , Jarod , but I thought for sure you 'd be interested ... in saving the life of a close friend . [ Groans ] Ouch ! - Zoe ! - Jarod ! - Lyle , let her go ! - That 's exactly what I wanna do . But Mr. Cox actually wants to exploit the safety and well-being of your girlfriend ... to his advantage . All right . What do you want ? To propose a quid pro quo . Don 't , Jarod ! I don 't know why these people want you ... but they will kill you , I know that ! [ Mr. Cox ] If you want Zoe to live ... you 'll surrender yourself to us tonight at Rosing 's Farm ... Highway 12 , outside Blue Cove ... in exactly one hour . Lyle ! Damn it ! One hour from now . That 's exactly when Ethan will be on that subway train . [ Rats Squealing ] From the bottom of my heart , Miss Parker - From the bottom of my heart , Miss Parker - My first memory of you was in the Centre lobby . You were smoking a cigarette . I was six or seven , and you knelt down ... took a drag and blew smoke in my face . And here you are ... still blowin ' smoke . For what it 's worth , Miss Parker - I can never have my mother back ... but I can damn well save my brother . You tell me everything you know about 7677 ... and I consider letting you live another day . I 'm the last chance saloon here , Raines . 7677 is a Washington D.C. subway train ... departing from Beacon Station in a little over one hour from now . Then what ? When it pulls into Freedom Station ... the subway and everything above it will blow up . It 's your brother who will plant the bomb and guide the subway . - Our Father , who art in heaven - - Not so fast . Before she died , my mother said something about her " unfinished work " .. about her " plan . " What did she mean by that ? - Then you never found it either ? - Found what ? Word has it your mother left a D.S.A. explaining exactly what her plan was . But it was the one piece of incriminating evidence ... I never found or destroyed . You find it , you find her plan . You gotta know something more about it . It 's about what everything 's about , Miss Parker . It 's about the Centre , all the lies . Just remember ... whatever answers your mother may have left behind ... there is still one person alive ... who does know the whole truth . - Who ? - [ Gunshot ] [ Sighs ] Daddy ? It 's not right for my little girl to have blood like that on her hands . Was it the blood you were worried about ... or the truth ? Jarod should be here in 20 minutes . Take your positions . Be ready . [ Mr. Lyle ] And you 're sure he 'll come ? Oh , he 'll come . Zoe , we couldn 't have done this without you . - Go to hell . - All 's fair in love and war . You know , it 's too bad you 're not Asian . But maybe when all this is over , we can find a place for you in our renewal wing . - Why can 't you just leave Jarod alone ? - Because he belongs to us . [ Screams ] [ Coughing ] - It 's not Jarod ! - It 's Major Charles . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] - Dad ? - It 's me - Zoe . - Then you 're all right ? - Yeah , everything 's okay on this end , Jarod . Though I am pretty damn curious about who Cox and Lyle are . - I am so sorry that you got involved with this . - Be careful , Jarod . I will . Ethan ? - Stay away ! - I 'm not going to hurt you . - [ Voices Whispering ] - [ Grunting ] - They say not to trust you . - No , they don 't . - Not all of them . - I wish I didn 't have to hear them ! It 's your inner sense , Ethan . It 's what makes you special . - Who are you ? - I 'm your brother . - She told me about you . - She ? Of course . One of the voices . She 's the one you must listen to , Ethan . - Who is she ? - Your mother . You never got to know her . They never allowed you to know her . But she is your mother . She 's your guide , Ethan . Listen to her voice . It 's your inner sense . - Mr. Raines is my guide . - No , he took your gifts and he used them against you . He taught you to fear those voices instead oflearning how to embrace them . He used you , Ethan . He 's still using you . Don 't let him use your gift for destruction . - I have to follow his word . - If you do , then innocent people will die . That 's not you , Ethan . That 's not who you are . Just listen to her voice , Ethan . Focus on her voice . Trust him , Son . Jarod is the one . Listen to her . # Cree craw toad 's foot # [ Together ] # Geese walk barefoot # - # Cree craw toad 's foot , geese walk barefoot # - Brother ? Yes . # Cree craw toad 's foot , geese walk barefoot # You can break free of the hold he has over you . Just listen to her voice . You have a family now , a real family . We 'll always be there . Now tell me , where is the bomb ? You can 't stop the train . The bomb can 't be defused . I was on three bomb squads and two army demolition units . I can defuse it . The bomb 's on the undercarriage . There 's no stopping it or the train . Then we 're gonna have to send the train somewhere else . Where 's Freedom Station ? - It 's on the track veering right . - Where 's the track veering left go ? It 's to an abandoned maintenance yard . They closed it years ago . - Well , hang on . - Look , it 's no use . I programmed it to automatically take the track to the right . - Did I tell you I was a rocket scientist too ? - 3,000 yards . - 2,900 . - Come on ! 2,800 ! Do it ! - I got it . - The train has an auto brake that engages in 40 seconds . - The bomb goes off 20 seconds after that . - Come on ! Get out of here ! Freeze it , please ! - Miss Parker , listen to me . There is a bomb on board . - I know ! - We have less than 60 seconds . - Then defuse it ! I can 't ! It 's underneath the train ! - Then stop the train ! - It 's too late ! If we are lucky , this train will slow down enough for us to jump off . But I can 't stop the explosion . This is your brother , Miss Parker . Our brother . It could be a beginning . Don 't make it an end ! [ Mrs. Parker 's Voice ] I 'm your mother . I love you . You sound just like her . [ Jarod ] It 's your mother 's voice he can hear , Miss Parker . Maybe you can hear it too . Trust that voice . Miss Parker ? The auto brake has engaged . We have less than 20 seconds . - [ Groans ] - What 's the matter with him ? Side effects of Raines 's work . Now what 's it gonna be , Miss Parker ? Help me save him . Help me save our family . It 's your choice . Come on . Put your arm around me . Go ! - [ Miss Parker ] Now what ? - [ Jarod ] We jump ! Now ! [ Car Alarms Blaring ]

K-Hey , Southern California ! Mr. Simpson , just a severe sprain . In fact , it 's kind of a minor miracle . But we 'd like you to stay for observation . Thank you , doctor . That 's good to hear , but I really have to go . Excuse me . Mr. Simpson , this precaution is for your own good . Thank you , doctor , thank you . Hey , nice talking to you . Excuse me . - Mr . Simpson ? Doug Simpson ? - Yes . I 'm Detective Nyland . This is Sergeant Stockdale . We 'd like to ask you a few questions . What for , guys ? No one got hurt here but me . I really have to go . Well , I 'm afraid that won 't be possible . We have to have a statement . I can 't press charges against myself . Look , you either talk to us here , or you talk to us downtown . Here . Here 's good . 97.5 KHEY-FM . K-Hey , Southern California ! Okay , Mr. Simpson , tell us , how did all this start ? For the past 10 years , I 've been manager of KHEY Radio . I 've also been raising my two daughters since my wife died and doing pretty good at both jobs , if I have to say so myself . - So ? - So , what if our ratings have slipped ? What 's wrong with being number six ? Ninety-two other stations in this town would love to be number 6 . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Bye . Loved the way you handled that . I love the radio business , love you . I don 't care if we 're number 6 or number 60 . I 'm sticking with you . Why are we talking numbers , huh ? The only number I 'm interested in today is 15 . My little girl 's 15th birthday . And I am going home . And well you should be . - Pitch , pitch . - I like a little flat . It 's hip . 97.5 KHEY-FM . From B.B. King to Buddy Holly we shake , rattle and roll 24 hours a day . Yeah , it should have been one of the happiest days of my life . But I didn 't see it coming . Maybe I should have seen it coming . Maybe I didn 't want to see it coming . No father sees it coming . Dad ? Honey ? Go , Dad , go ! Daddy , you 're only 37 . Kareem is 41 , and he does this every night . Well , Kareem 's got Magic passing to him . Look who I 've got . Let 's clean this kitchen . Simpson 's System on the double . Yes , sir . Where 's Katie ? Katie ! Katie ! Hi , Dad . Come on , come on , there you go . Take it easy . Gee , working hard . Well ... . Happy birthday . - Dad , I already have a teddy bear . - Well , I know , but it 's pretty beat-up . I mean , it was for your first 15 years , and this is for your next 15 . - Thanks , Dad . - Happy birthday . And now , for your real present . Europe . Oh , Dad ... . I 've been doing some thinking and I 'm not sure I want to go on the school trip this summer . Oh , you 're kidding . Why ? Well , you 're gonna be all alone . I mean , who 's gonna take care of you ? Bonnie 's too young . Well , there 's Janet , but- - Come on , Katie . Now , stop worrying about me and forget about Janet . This is your life we 're talking about , right ? Come on , sit down . Look , I 'd love to take that ticket and tear it right up . Keep you right here this summer . But you have to go . It 's important . I mean , it 's Europe . The Eiffel Tower , Piccadilly Circus . And the canals in Venice . And Roma . Go find out where spaghetti was born . Dad , spaghetti was invented in China . Marco Polo brought it back to Italy . Yeah ? Well , what about the meatballs , Miss Straight-A Student ? Let 's get Schwarzenegger , Jr . Hey , Richard , let 's go . Get over here , pronto . - Big night tonight , Mr. Simpson . - You don 't want to miss it . Happy birthday . Did you get my flowers ? - Yeah , Richard . You didn 't have to . - Okay , let 's go . I love you . Okay , let 's move it . Simpson 's System . Katie , on the double . Is there something wrong with your sister ? - What am I , my sister 's keeper ? - Funny . Don 't move . I 'll be right back . Excuse me . Richard , Richard , take it easy . You 'll hurt yourself . Check you later , dude . Well , what 's with you ? First , you make me bring you to this crazy place , then you flake out . Yeah , what fun , dancing with my daddy . They don 't know I 'm your daddy . They just think you like old men . Suck it up , pal . - Dad , do you think I 'm pretty ? - Of course I do . You 're saying that because you 're my father . - That 's not true . - Okay . Am I as pretty as her ? Dad ! Dad ! - Daddy ! - I saw that . - Happy birthday , baby . - Hi . - Sorry I 'm late . Don 't worry . - Okay . Where were you ? You missed blowing out the candles . The fabric did not come in . I had to redesign half the fall collection . I 'm sorry . I 'm really sorry . - It 's okay . I forgive you . - Thanks . It 's the first time you missed it , though , since she 's 12 years old . - Oh , God . - Believe it ? Three years already . - Three years ? Us ? - Yeah . - How was the party ? - It was great . Really good . I guess she didn 't tell you about Richard , then ? - What about Richard ? - It 's okay . Just get yourself a double Kahlúa punch . Take a deep breath . - A double ? - A double . It 's okay . I 'm waiting . Daddy , I 've been going steady with Richard since elementary school . I think it 's about time I started dating other guys . Katie , come on , you don 't really mean that . How could you do that to Richard ? He 's practically part of our family . Dad , that 's the problem . We 're more like brother and sister than boyfriend and girlfriend . There 's just no passion in our relationship . Katie , you and Richard , you 're just 15 . Passion comes later . Much later . Way later . Daddy , I 'm breaking up with Richard . There 's just no magic between us . Dad , I understand how you feel , but he 's still your friend . And if you want to see him , it 's all right . Just let me know when he 's coming , so I can make myself scarce . One more , please . Less pineapple . I 'm only gone for a little while . While I 'm gone , be careful because- - They 're out there . Now , you behave yourself . I know what those wild radio conventions are like . - Yeah , don 't bring home anything . - Hey , you , hey . Knock it off . I 'm supposed to say those things . Just what I need , more women in my life . - I need more women in my life . - Come on , come on . Let 's go . - Hey , take care of my girls . - I will . One , two , three . We love you . - Bye . - Come on . Well , so you 're sure you want to go through with it ? I never wanted anything more in my life . Okay . - Here we go . - Yeah ! You know , these braces are not due to come off for another two months . Yank them , doc . Now . Excuse me . Simpson . We have an appointment . A wash and a rinse ? Then send her to Felipe . Felipe ! It 's okay . Thank you . How do they feel , Katie ? Higher . Higher . Not that high . Take it easy . I 'm home . - Hi , sweetheart , could you get that ? - Okay . - Hi , Daddy . - Hi , baby . Happy to be home . Hello . I 'm not sure . Hang on one second . - Katie , it 's for you . - I 'm on the phone . Take a message . Katie can 't come to the phone right now . Can I take a message ? Mark ? Right . Okay , Mark , I 'll tell her you called . Bye-bye . Hello ? Hold on . - Katie , it 's for you . - She told you . She 's on the phone . Katie can 't come to the phone right now . Can I take a message ? Okay , Bob . Yeah , I 'll tell her . Bob , do you know that Katie has her own phone ? It 's been busy for two hours ? Oh , sorry , Bob . Bye . Hang on . What 's going on here ? - Hi . Is Katie ready yet ? - Ready for what ? Andy ? I 'll be right down . Dad ? - Well , isn 't it great ? Janet helped me . - Isn 't she beautiful , Doug ? Doug ? Dad , say something . Doug ? - Oh , well , we gotta go . - Yeah . - See you later . - Okay . - Bye , Daddy . - Have a good time . - Okay . Bye-bye . - Bye . Doug , what do you think ? Dad , what do you really think ? What do I really think ? Who was that kid ? - Andy , from down the street . - No , no , no . The one in the skirt . She cannot stay a little girl forever . She is growing up . This did not happen overnight . It 's been coming on for months . - She asked me to help her . - You didn 't have to . What ? If I didn 't help her , someone else would . - You can 't stop life from happening . - Well , I can sure slow it down a bit . - Oh , yeah , how ? - How ? Total control . Total control . No boy comes here and takes my daughter out unless I know who he is , where he lives , who his parents are what they do for a living , where they go , for how long and who they 're gonna be with . Total control . - That 's brilliant , Doug . Good luck . - Total ! Total ! Dad ! Door ! Oh , Brian . Nice of you to stop by . I know you 're the best running back in the history of Wheeler High and I 'd sure hate to run into you in a dark alley . But two speeding tickets in one year . I 'm sorry . Get hold of yourself . - Hello . - Mr . Simpson , is Katie there ? - Katie ? - Yeah . Brian , no , Katie can 't come to the phone now . Brian , stop crying . I 'm home . Get the phone . I got the phone . Get the door . Total control . The door . Take a message . - My name is Steve . - Total . - Hi . Tom . - Total control . - Hello . This is Paul . - Hi , I 'm Will . Dad ! Door ! My name is Bobby . Hi , I 'm Doug . - Hi , Mr. Simpson . - Look before you say anything , I want you to know I marched in Selma in 1967 . I was the third guy pulled out of the lunch counter in Montgomery in 1968 . I have no idea what you 're talking about , sir . I 'm here to deliver your water . I 'm your new Sparkletts man . Leroy ! Leroy . I guess I had that coming . - Kyle . - Mickey . - I 'm Perry . - I 'm Sonny . - My name 's Ted . - Lyle . - Vestor . - Hi , I 'm Stoker . That 's it . Twins . Total . Total control . Doug , those are the new ratings . We 're down to number 9 and sliding . I don 't know what the hell 's happened . Well , what 's wrong with being number 9 ? Why are we talking numbers ? Eighty-nine other stations would love to be number 9 . You have your finger on the pulse of the kids . Now , come up with something , like the competition . A sex therapy talk show . Date with a rock ' n ' roll star . - Topless bikini beach contest . - That 's a great idea . But not for us . Mr. Simpson , I finally got through on that important phone call . It 's line 4 . Thank you , Martha . Excuse me . I think the market 's hot on Gypsy music . Bonnie , what 's happening ? Who called ? - No one , Dad . It 's really quiet here . - Well , quiet 's good , right ? Not that kind of quiet . Strange quiet . Eerie quiet . Why would all the calls stop ? It 's like she doesn 't live here anymore . Oh , she lives here , all right . At least till Sunday . - She 's got a date for the beach . - Oh , well . Anything else happen ? - Well , I did see her report card . - What ? An A-minus in English . A B-plus in American history . And a B , no plus , in geometry . Dad , I 'll bounce back in finals . I always do . I won 't make a big deal out of this , but let me leave you with one thought . A mind , a good mind , is a terrible thing to waste . So 's a good body . Funny . So funny I forgot to laugh . You know something ? When a father gets close to his kids I mean , too close , nature has a way of helping the father out . The kids become really obnoxious . Thanks a lot . I didn 't say anything about your marks . It 's all over town . Oh , sure . Remember , some day this 'll be happening to you . - It can 't be . - Better not be . - Dad ? - I 'm here because I want a date with my daughter . I 'm willing to wait in line like everyone else . - Dad , that 's very cute . - No , no , I don 't- - Look in that book , Bonnie , and make a commitment . - Listen , how 's Thursday ? - Dad , I 'm busy . I 'm sorry . - Friday ? - Dad , I can 't . - Saturday ? - Dad , I 'm sorry . Sunday ? Sunday , please ? Give me Sunday . I want Sunday . What am I doing Sunday ? - Okay . Okay . Cancel it . - Oh , thank you . Thank you . - Dad , I gotta go . - No , wait , wait , wait . - Who was that ? - Him . - Him who ? - Oh , some kid . His name 's Joey . I didn 't meet any Joey . How come I didn 't meet him ? You know the rules . Katie was afraid you 'd frighten him . He 's shy . He 's an artist , kind of . - What do you mean , he paints ? - No , he 's a musician . - What kind of musician ? Rock ? - I don 't know . - Classical ? - I don 't know . - Rhythm and blues ? - I don 't know . What do you mean ? Why don 't you know ? Be specific . What are you here for ? Why am I paying you ? Guys and girls , it 's chow time . - Where have you been ? - You 're lucky I made it back . There 's a hamburger for you . And a hot dog for Miss Bonnie . - Wait a minute . Where 's Katie ? - She 's in the water . - Don 't eat . - She 'll be right back , Doug . No , no , no , no . This is my Sunday . We eat together . Don 't eat . Junk food 's best when eaten hot . You 're absolutely right . Katie ! Katie ! Hi , Dad . Who was that boy ? Was that that Joey kid ? The kid with the flying saucer truck ? I saw the earring . You couldn 't make a date with me . You had to sneak a boyfriend in ? When I broke the date , he thought I was dating some other guy . He followed me here . Men are so insecure . - Hi , Katie . - Hi . Would you stop bouncing , please ? And for God 's sake , cover yourself . Here , put this on . Dad , I 'm dressed like everyone else . What 's the matter with you ? You 're acting like every man on this beach is after my body . - -after my body . - -after my body . What are you looking at ? Get back to your blankets . - Get off my case , you old blob . - Yeah , get out of the way . " Old blob " ? " Get out of the way " ? Come here . Come here . - Dad ! - Run for your life ! Help ! Dad ? - Doug ? - Run ! Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! I wouldn 't have hurt him . Not that he didn 't have it coming , the little creep . I mean , I know exactly what was on his dirty little 12-year-old mind . After all , I was 12 years old once myself . That 's what Janet didn 't understand when she told me to seek psychiatric help before it was too late . Janet was never a 12-year-old boy . Look , I 've read a little Freud , Adler , Jung , and that book- - What 's it called , You 're Okay , I 'm Okay ? I 'm not stupid . I went to college for a year and a half . Almost two . So when Janet said " irrational , " I think she meant " abnormal . " What do you think ? The word that comes to my mind is " normal . " Really ? You see , Mr. Simpson , you 're standing in the center of a sexual explosion . There are 9.5 million women in the U.S. between the ages of 15 and 19 . And approximately 47 percent of those young women have already had sexual intercourse . Wait a minute , then . That leaves 53 percent who are still virgins . And thank God my Katie 's one of those . Not necessarily , Mr. Simpson . You see , 97 percent of that 53 percent are just lying about it . Well , God , doctor , what 's happening to these girls ? It 's boys that are happening to these girls , Mr. Simpson . Do you have any idea how often the average teenage boy thinks about sex in a day ? I don 't know , 15 , 20 times a day ? Six hundred and fifty-two times in one day . Look , doctor , I don 't want to see my Katie get hurt . She 's not ready to deal , emotionally with what 's happening to her , physically . She won 't have to . With my help , if you choose to take it you both have a good chance of getting through this difficult period . Oh , I hope so . Just trust me , Mr. Simpson . Now , the first thing that you have to do is read this . " Daddy 's Little Girl : A Guide to Raising Your Teenage Daughter by Dr. Herman Fishbinder . " That 's you . It 's in its fifth printing . Coming out in paperback in June . - Nice picture . - Thank you . Start at the beginning . Read it carefully . It just possibly has all the answers to your problems . But you can call me any hour of the day , if you have a question . Thank you . Thank you , Dr. Fishbinder . - Oh , just one more thing . - Yeah ? Just in case you 're a slow reader , better put your daughter on the pill . What ? Right away . " Taking responsibility for the sexual education of your daughter . Don 't count on your daughter getting a good sexual education in school . Don 't count on her to be frank with you about the first sexual stirrings within her . " What can I count on ? " But if your daughter should ask you a question about sex discuss it with her in a calm , rational and nonthreatening manner . For suggested responses , see appendix C. " " Five hundred years ago a boy 16 years old would come to your door with a flock of sheep . " Oh , sweetheart . I didn 't hear you come in . Dad , I have had the most wonderful glorious , fabulous time of my life . Oh , that 's terrific . Maybe sometime we 'll talk about it . - Dad ? - Yes ? I was wondering if we could talk about it now ? Oh , now ? Sure . What am I here for , huh ? Come on , let 's sit down . Here you go . If you 're really interested in a guy ... . I was wondering , well ... . When do you know when it 's the right time to ... ? When do you know when it 's right to have- - ? Katie 500 years ago a boy 16 years old would come to the door with a flock of sheep . And he 'd ask for your hand in marriage . You 'd have kids by 16 and be dead by 23 . That was the average life span then . I mean , today , with vitamins and organ transplants and penicillin you 'll probably live to be 90 . So at 15 , even though you 're feeling this biological urge by the way , which is normal and healthy medical science and God has given you time , has allowed you a lot of time to make this kind of a decision . And when it happens , it 'll be special . It 'll be beautiful . So don 't rush it . I hope I 've shed some light on this subject for you . Yeah , Dad . I know what to do now . Wait a minute now . Would you mind telling me what that might be ? To make my own decisions . And never , ever ask my dad a question he doesn 't have the guts to answer . Night , Dad . What 's going on ? You call me at 3 , 4 , 5 in the morning . - I have a patient to see . - Something happened . - Something wrong with the book ? - Oh , no . The book was right . This is my problem . My daughter asked me a question , and I couldn 't handle it . - Of course , you know what question . - Oh , yes . What father can answer such a question ? I was set back a bit . I 'm okay because I kept on reading the book , and I came to chapter 15 . The mother substitute . A friend , a girlfriend , a lover someone who can fill the absence of the original mother . Yes . Exactly . Now , I have one of those . - And better yet , I love her . - So move her in . Move her in . - Well , yeah , yeah . - Don 't the children like her ? Yes , they do . They don 't love her the way I love her , but they love her . - So ? - It 's just that you don 't know Janet . I don 't think I could just move her in . I 'd probably have to marry her . - Do you have a problem with that ? - Marriage ? I don 't know . I 've done it once before , and it changes everything . It 's a big step . Mr. Simpson , maybe the problem you have is not between you and your daughter , but between you and Janet . - So would you like to talk about that ? - No , I have no problem with Janet . Then take charge . Act now . - Hello . - Doug ? Oh , Jeff , how are you ? Are you crazy ? You never came back to the office today . What happened ? I had to do some shopping . Some very heavy shopping . Doug , the overnights are in . We 're down to 12 . Our asses are sinking into the sunset . Stop shopping . - Hi . - Hi . - Okay , hold it right there . - What ? - You look beautiful . You look terrific . - Oh , thank you . Perfect ... - ... for what I 'm about to do . - No , don 't start Doug . It took me an hour to get into this dress and I 'm not gonna take it off now . Champagne wishes and caviar dreams . I always wanted you to do this . - You didn 't have to , you know ? - Oh , I know . That 's why I did it , because I love you . - Would you help me put it on ? - Oh . Allow me . - Bingo . - I love you . I love you . - I love you . I love you so much . - Easy . Your makeup , your dress . I don 't care about that . All I care about is you and me right now . We 're going to dinner , and then we 'll have a good- - - What are you doing with your hand ? - What does it feel like I 'm doing ? - Come on , get out of there , little fella . - Little fella ? Sex , sex , sex . I mean , is that all women think about ? I mean , wouldn 't it be nice if we waited at least until you said yes ? Yes . Yes . I say yes . - Yes . - Now , now , wait . Okay , all right , look . Please , would you stop ? What ? I 've got a lot on my mind . It 's a big decision I made today . We 've got the rest of our lives to make love . Pace yourself . You 're right . Okay . Where are you going now ? I don 't know . I guess I 'll take a cold shower and start all over again . A shower . Well , I did it . And , hey , I love her . I love her . Katie . I love her . I love her . I 'll get it . - Hello ? - Katie ? Who is this ? Hey , does it matter ? Does it really matter ? Who the- - ? Doug ? Sweetheart ? - Hello . - Hi , honey . I 'm very sorry , but while you were in the shower , I got a call . There 's an emergency . I 'll be at the radio station for most of the night . I 'll call you as soon as I can . I love you . And remember , the ring is real . It 's real . Better be real . - Your name , sir . - Well , see , I 'm not really invited . I 'm a patient of Dr. Fishbinder 's . It 's very important that I see him . Are you on medication ? - No , no . - Remain in the vehicle , sir . Dr. Fishbinder , please . - Yes ? - Dr . Fishbinder , this is Doug . I know . I recognize the breathing . How 'd you get this address ? I told the service it was an emergency . They 're fired ! Take it easy , Mr. Simpson . - I have to see you . - That 's impossible . I 'm having a party . But I can see you . Just talk to the camera . And I 'm right here . Dr. Fishbinder , I called home , and a strange voice answered . I think it was that boy , Joey . I want to break that little- - Now , take it easy , Mr. Simpson . This is actually good news . Remember chapter 25 , Befriend the Enemy ? If your daughter goes out with a boy you find obnoxious , never say anything negative about him . That will drive her straight into his arms . Instead , make yourself pals of the boy and soon your daughter will see him as you do . - Are you sure ? - Oh , no , I 'm not sure . That 's why I have a Rolls-Royce , a home in Bel Air and a house in the south of France . Of course I 'm sure . Now , act natural . You 're one of them . Remember , tonight that boy must be your best friend . Hi , kids . Playing charades ? Let me guess . The Garden of Eden ? No , no . Dirty Dancing . Dad , I 'm sorry . We found your old 45s and Joey wanted- - We thought they were funny and- - Katie , Katie , no need to explain to me . I did the same thing when my parents were out . And when you guys have kids , they 're gonna do the same thing to you . Isn 't that what life is all about ? Oh , my God , Katie , you have the coolest dad . You 're so lucky , Katie . Your dad is , like , killer . Oh , well ... . Dad , this is Joey . Oh . Joey . Pleasure to meet you . Nice to meet you . I was just leaving . Wait a minute , Joey . Don 't go yet . The night is young . Come on , take your shades off . Let your hair ... . Never mind . You want oldies ? I got oldies . Let me play some for you . Now , this one was banned in Boston . Okay ? The funny part is , the kids didn 't know how dirty it was until it was banned . It just goes to show you how uptight some parents can be . I 'm out of here . See you . Joey , wait a minute . Joey , wait , wait . Leaving so soon ? This is a very strange scene , Mr. Simmons . It 's Simpson . Just like my daughter . What 's so strange ? How you 're handling this whole thing . It 's just a little too good to be true . Most parents don 't like kids . No parents like me . How come you 're so nice ? Well , Joey , you may not believe this , and I admit it does sound a little wild but you remind me of myself when I was your age . - What 's that supposed to mean ? - Well , you 're a musician and a rebel and a loner . And that 's how I was when I was a kid . In fact , I understand why Katie likes you . What do you say , gang ? We go to one of my old hangouts , and it 's my treat . Let 's go . There you go . Are you for real , Mr. Simpson ? Am I for real , Joey ? Did you happen to notice my Jaguar outside ? Come on . I met Mick Jagger backstage after a Stones concert in 1969 . Wow , you saw the Stones in ' 69 ? That was before I was born . You saw all the greats . Jagger . Lennon . You actually saw Jim Morrison . Joey , I 'm surprised that you like that kind of music . - Hey , Joey . - Oh , man . What did you do , trade in your truck for that lemon ? Come on , guys , be cool , all right ? So are we up for a drag , or is this car of yours all show and no go ? - Give me a break . - Wait . Who are these clowns ? - Let 's just go , okay , Joe ? - Wait a minute . Dad , they 're just a bunch of geeks from school . Just ignore them . Ignore them ? Yo , boys this happens to be a Jaguar XKE , 4.2 liter 265 horsepower , which means Joey will meet you any time any place , at any distance . - Let 's go . - I will ? Joey , you back down now , where does it end ? Right . The spot , now ! All right ! The spot ? What spot ? Hey , buddy , ready to get your butts kicked ? Good luck . You 're gonna need it . Joey , I know that Corvette . It 's an animal . But we can win , Joey . We can beat them . It 's all in the driving . - Yeah . - Okay . Look all you have to do is concentrate . Get out fast , go through those gears . All right ? You got it ? - I got it . - All right . - Mr . Simpson ? - Yeah , Joey ? You are for real . Good luck , babe . All right , all right . That 's enough . Go start the race . Good luck . All right , Joey ! What am I doing here ? - Sorry I stalled the car . - Forget about it . - Did we destroy that Corvette or what ? - Yeah . Give me a hand . I think I need a push . Come on . Wait , wait , wait , wait . That was close . I 'm afraid we can 't have it for you today . We can give you a loaner . It 's not comparable . But considering what you did to your own car ... . Thank you . Come on , Dad . Come on . Dad , do you think machines feel pain ? What ? What are you talking about ? Well , there 's this whole theory about inanimate objects feeling pain . Katie , if you 're worried about the car , don 't . That 's what insurance is for . If you 're worried about Joey , it wasn 't his fault , okay ? You know , I don 't know about that . I think it was symptomatic of his whole immature personality . Now , wait a minute- - Wait a minute . What am I hearing here ? Dad , you 're gonna be terribly disappointed , but I broke up with Joey . You broke- - ? You broke up with Joey ? I thought he was so important to you . Oh , set him up and shoot him down , huh ? - Who 's next ? - Dad , what are you talking about ? What am I talking about ? Take a good look , Katie . That cute , adorable face staring back at you is not a weapon . Don 't think of it as a weapon because it 's not . I mean , if it was a weapon , it could backfire . Trust me . Dad , I 'm sorry . It 's just a phase I 'm going through , you know ? I 've never been as popular with boys before . It 's kind of a kick having this power . I 'll be over it soon , I promise . I hope so . Now , who 's the new guy ? What new guy ? I got it . Hi , Timothy- - Joe- - ? Richard ? Hi , Katie . Hi . What did you do to your hair ? And your clothes ? I liked you fine the way you were . I didn 't . Look , can I just talk to your father for a second ? Yeah , come in . Dad ! Hi , Joey . Oh , Richard , how are you ? Hi . Can I see you for a moment , Mr. Simpson ? Sure , sure . Come on in the kitchen . Bonnie , could you excuse us for a minute , sweetheart ? Sorry . Well , there 's brain damage , but at least he 's still breathing . So how 've you been , pal ? I just wanted to tell you , Mr. Simpson I 'm not going on the school trip to Europe with Katie . Oh , come on , Richard . Why ? You should go . Look , Mr. Simpson I know that you were counting on me to watch over Katie and all but if I go , you know , I mean , I 'll just be cramping her style . What if she meets a count ? Or a duke ? Or that Prince Charles guy ? Richard , Prince Charles is married . Yeah . But not happily . Well , we don 't know that for sure . Hi , Timothy- - Joey ? What are you doing here ? We decided we weren 't gonna see each other for a while . I 'm not here to see you , babe . I 'm here to see your dad . Is he around ? Great . Yeah . Dad ! - Joey , how are you ? - Hi . - Can we ... ? - Yeah , yeah , sure . Right in here . Stretcher cases to the left . Walking wounded to the right . One more guy in leather we can start a rock group . Shut up . Who is it ? Hi , Timothy . I can 't believe it . I never thought Katie and me would break up . - Joey , get ahold of yourself . - You don 't understand . My dad never liked me . No dad ever liked me till I met you . Joey , Joey . Come on , have a seat . Sit down . Have a seat . - Katie dumped me . - Yeah . Don 't you dump me too . Please , Mr. Simpson . Joey , I wouldn 't do anything like that . - You mean it ? - Of course . Because I was thinking , maybe we could hang out together . I don 't know . Maybe go to a concert or something ? Sure . Why not , why not ? Only next time we 'll take the bus . Yeah . Daddy , this is very embarrassing . Timothy 's here . Can you get rid of these guys nicely ? Yeah , nicely . Anyone else coming ? Because we 're running out of rooms . She is a wonderful girl . Be smart . Make friends with the old man . Thank you , sweetheart . Oh , thank you . Bonnie , isn 't it ? So how did you two kids meet ? You have classes together at school ? Oh , no , I wish we did . I 'm a senior . Thank you , Bonnie . We met at a philosophy seminar after school . We had a very interesting discussion about inanimate objects . Does this mean you 'll be going away to college in the fall ? Timothy is going to attend Yale . - Oh , Yale . - Yes , my father 's quite angry with me . Both he and my grandfather went to Princeton , and I 've disappointed them . Princeton . Both . We 're off . Maurice won 't hold our table much longer . Even for me . Oh , well , let 's not keep Maurice waiting . Have a nice time . - Good night , Daddy . - Good night , sweetheart . Good night , Bonnie . Oh , I almost forgot . Here 's the phone number of the restaurant and the number of my parents ' . We 'll be there for a cappuccino after dinner . Just make sure she 's home by 12 . I assure you , sir , it 'll be more like 11 . - Good night , sir . - Good night , Timothy . - Good night , Daddy . - Good night , sweetheart . Drive safe . Bye-bye . What do you think , Dad ? Perfect , right ? Yeah . Wow . Yale . The number of the restaurant . Home by 11 . Perfect . At last- - Wait a minute . Chapter 52 . He 's too perfect . Of course , chapter 52 . A Wolf in Sheep 's Clothing . This is the most dangerous of the Don Juan Casanova , Warren Beatty species . Your daughter is in grave danger from a formidable predator , Mr. Simpson . Just tell me what to do . Didn 't you read the next chapter ? Surveillance ? Wait a minute . You want me to spy on Timothy ? Well , even if I could I mean , anything that I said to Katie would just be my word against his . Do you own a camera , Mr. Simpson ? I suggest a Tri-X 1000 for day and infrared with a 2.4 lens for night . Good shot . Gotcha . Gotcha . Gotcha . You 'll never be president . Katie ? Sweetheart ? Katie ? Bonnie . Bonnie , wake up , wake up . Where 's Katie ? Where is she ? Get your book and find out where she is . I don 't need my book , Dad . She 's with Timothy at the beach . - Go to bed . - Thank you . Katie , what are you- - ? Doug we 're down to 34 in the ratings . For the love of God do something before they can us . - Jeff , a lot of other- - - Doug , no ! Don 't say , " A lot of stations would love to be number 34 . " If you say , " A lot of stations would love to be number 34 " I will kill you . Understand ? I 'll get back to you . " Discipline . Discipline is a key word in every father 's vocabulary . You are the parent . You set the rules . You are in control . If the rules are broken , it is your duty to punish accordingly . You must enforce the rules . You are the enforcer . " Where were you ? What have you been doing , and I want the truth . I was at the beach with Timothy . I guess I forgot the time . - I 'm sorry . - Let me tell you what time it is . It 's 4 : 00 in the morning . Now , I had no idea things had gone this far . You 're grounded . Grounded ? For how long ? For the rest of your life . And that means no phones , no dates , no nothing . Dad , Timothy 's prom is in two weeks . Then I go away to Europe . He goes away to school . How could you do this to me ? I could tell you things about your precious Timothy . Look , let 's just say I 'm doing this for your own good , okay ? Now , wait a minute if you did something tonight- - And I 'm not saying you did and I hope you didn 't . But if you did it should have been special . It should have been beautiful and special . There is nothing beautiful or special that ends with you climbing in a window at 4 : 00 in the morning . - Now , go to your room . - I 'm in my room . Then stay here . I don 't need these . I 'm the enforcer . - Hi . - Hi . - Hi . - Hi . What 's this ? What 's this ? I didn 't want my father to see your things at my place . Heaven forbid he should see my razor , my toothbrush and my Indian robe . Come on , Janet , you 're a grown woman . I know , I know , but after all , I 'm still his daughter . You know about fathers and daughters . Well , just follow the sad music up the stairs . You know , I 'm really- - I 'm really angry at you , young lady . Hey , wait a minute . Look at me when I talk to you . You begged me to help you , and I did . Now I feel like a total and complete jerk . I guess you hate me too . I don 't hate- - I don 't hate you . I just feel your behavior is getting out of hand . I mean , all you care about now is boys , boys , boys . Your grades are slipping . You sneak in your window at 4 . Driving your father crazy . Maybe you don 't care about what you 're doing to him , but I do . I 'm sorry . Okay , baby , it 's okay . Stop crying . Come on . Hey , I 'm a woman . Remember ? That only works on men . Come on , tell me how I can help you . So that 's it . I 'm the enforcer , and when I say something in my house ... - ... they do it . - Good , good . You 're finally in control of your life again . Yeah , and my daughter is safe . And Timothy is leaving town . She 's just gonna see him one more time , on prom night . What did you say ? She 's gonna see him once more , at prom . I promised Janet . Prom night ? Prom night ? Did I hear you say " prom night " ? Just one more time . It 's no big deal . Didn 't you read the book ? Look at this . " 81.5 percent of American girls lose their virginity on prom night . " It 's in the book . It is in the book . - In the book . - Eighty-one ... . All right . All the work we 've done here is down the drain . I 'm giving you your money back . My secretary will send you a check . Now , get out ! Prom night , of course . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Doctor , look , look , look I 'm the enforcer , right ? I can handle this . I will call off prom night . Dr. Fishbinder , I give you my word . It 's off . - That was a close one . - I know . Don 't do that again . Doctor , I 'm sorry . Are you okay ? Is there anything I can do ? No , I 'm all right . That 's what I 'm here for . But it 's just so frustrating when you try to help ... . Wait a minute . Maybe there is something you can do for me . - Name it . Anything . - Don 't you work at a radio station ? Yeah . KHEY Radio . Well , maybe- - Maybe if you had some airtime available on your station maybe I could help all the other Doug Simpsons who are out there . What do you think ? I think it sounds like a good idea . I mean , after all , you certainly helped this Doug Simpson . It 'd be almost like public service . Here . You call this number . You ask for Jeff Roberts . He 's my assistant at the station . - And you 're on the air . - Great . Now , remember , the important thing is , for God 's sake put an end to prom night . Yes , I will . - Same time next week ? - Of course . - Mr . Simpson . - Yeah ? You 're my favorite patient . There he is , right there . Good evening . Oh , thank you very much . - Madam . - Thank you , Daddy . - I love your dress , where 's the rest ? - Daddy , it 's my creation . - I designed it . - Okay , sell them . Don 't wear them . Well , no one asked me , but I think it looks great . I want you to meet my fiancé , Doug Simpson . - My mother , Mrs. Pearson . - Hello , Mrs. Pearson . - Call me Emily . - Oh , how nice . - Chuck Pearson , my father . - How are you ? Nice to meet you , Mr. Pearson . Or should I call you Chuck ? No , Mr. Pearson 's fine . - Come on . - Friendly . Wait a minute . Doug , don 't you find it an odd coincidence that we 're at the same hotel as Katie 's prom ? - The prom 's here ? You 're kidding . - Don 't give me that . You are not going near Katie tonight . - I didn 't know prom- - - Is something wrong ? No , no . No , no problem . Dad , a friend of mine told me that the food here is really terrible . How tough can it be to throw on a couple of steaks ? Come on , your mother and I are starving . Can we eat , please ? This way , please . Could we have one of those tables ? Isn 't this a bit close to the harp ? Sorry . All the other tables are reserved . I thought you 'd say that . Well , so are we all comfortable ? Janet tells me you work for a radio station . Yeah . KHEY Radio . It 's a rock ' n ' roll station , isn 't it ? Yeah , mostly . You went to college in the ' 60s , didn 't you ? - Yeah . - Wore your hair long ? Marched against the war ? Experimented with drugs ? Played loud rock ' n ' roll music ? Wore bell-bottom pants , burned incense ? - I burnt my share , you know ? - You believed in free love ... - ... live with someone before marriage ? - Dad ! Then one day you realized you need a job and ran ... - ... to join the establishment . - Well , yeah , you 're right , but- - We did a few other things you seem to have left out . - Like what ? - Well , like help stop the war . End segregation , launch the Beatles . The Rolling Stones . The Four Tops . The Temps . And don 't forget Sonny and Cher . Doug , cut . You 're saddling Janet with a built-in family . Is that fair ? - Dad ! - I assure you , sir there 'll be no problem . We get along terrifically . There 's nothing to worry about is there , Doug ? - I said , is there , Doug ? - Oh , I 'm so sorry . This music is so loud I can hardly hear what anyone is saying . I 'm gonna have to speak to the manager . Janet , for the last hour that guy did nothing but look over my shoulder at every pretty young girl out in that lobby . Now , what the hell is going on ? - I 'm afraid you 'll have to leave . - You don 't understand . I 'm a parent . - That makes it twice as sick . - Well , come on , let 's go . Come on . Okay , okay , okay . I missed my prom . I love Doug , and Doug loves me . All right , here he comes , here he comes . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . Well , if I may ... . That 's it . Janet , it is time to call a flake a flake and a spade a spade . You marry him , you 're out of your mind . - I think Doug 's just a little nervous . - Chuck , chill out . Excuse me , excuse me . Hey , hey . Oh , there you are . - I need my car right away . - I 'm sorry . It 's crazy around here . I understand that . I gave you money when I got here before . - Did you find it ? - I 'm trying . I 'm trying . - Hey ! That 's my car . - Hey , man . " Restaurant . " Food . Is this romantic or what ? To us . Cheers . What time did your father say he wanted you home ? Midnight . - Who is it ? - Room service . Complimentary fruit for Señor Timothy Mitchell . He 's back there somewhere . What is the matter ? I mean , don 't you want to ? - Yes , I want to . - Okay , so , what 's the problem ? I mean , you 're not scared are you ? No , I 'm not scared . Then go with your feelings . Excuse me , señor , can you help me find Señor Timothy Mitchell ? Tim-o ? The old make-out king . He 's back there somewhere . Did I see you at the prom ? Okay , I get it . You want it to be my fault . I 'll do a little grabbing . You 'll do a little protesting . Okay , okay , okay , I got it . All right . Timothy , stop it . Look , it 's not gonna happen . It 's not gonna happen ? You want me . I mean , you said that you did . I did . But not here , not like this . It 's my first time . I 'd like it to be special . Now take me home . You teasing , little bitch . Thank you , Timothy . That was beautiful and special . Now , for the second time , take me home . Do you have any idea what you 're doing ? Who you 're doing it to ? - I 'll just go . No ! - Okay , okay , okay . Easy , no one 's gonna touch you . Let 's just sit here and talk for a while so that way when we both walk out together , it 'll look like I- - Complimentary fruit for Señor Timothy Mitchell . We don 't want any . Go away . - But it 's going to spoil , señor . - Damn it , Timothy , open the door . - Shut up . - Katie , is that you ? Who is that ? Dad ? What are you doing here ? You followed me ? Mr. Simpson , I just want you to know , nothing happened . Sir , nothing happened . I didn 't do anything . No , but I did . Katie . Katie ! Katie ! Well , girls , I 'm available . Oh , Katie .

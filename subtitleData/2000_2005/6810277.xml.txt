Whoa , whoa , wait . Not too fast . Hey , I just want to talk . You do that there , man . You do that . Oh , you 're scared now . Just go and get yourself some training wheels ! Go get a tattoo of a chicken ! Go ! I thought all your people know karate . Not everybody Chinese is Bruce Lee . Just calm yourself , Jimmy . Calm yourself . Just not my day . Whoo ! Wow . You think you can get me to 70 Fleming Street ? Of course . Wait a second . - You Jimmy Tong ? - That 's who I am . - Who are you ? - The name is Steena . - So how come you drive so fast ? - More fares . Mm . That why you had your license suspended nine times for speeding ? - But no accidents . - Do you remember where I 'm going ? - Seventy Fleming . - Get me there before I finish putting on my makeup , and I 'll double the meter . You serious ? Do I look like I have a sense of humor ? OK . - Hurry , open the gate ! - Hey , Jimmy ! Ho-ho-ho ! You drive too fast ! * I got mad skills I will get wild * * I got mad skills I will get wild * * I will get wild I will get wild * * I got mad skills I will get wild * * I got mad skills I will get wild * * I got mad skills I will get wild * * I will get wild I will get wild * Yeah , I got mascara and eyeliner left . You got five blocks . Don 't tell me you 're slowing down . You know , you drive like an old woman . - Hm ! - You 're not scared , are you ? * I got mad skills I will get wild * * I got mad skills I will get wild * * I will get wild I will get wild * Hey , you ! What do you think you 're doing ? Back off , buddy . She 's mine . Oh , it 's you , miss . Well , you lived up to your reputation . The job is yours . I have a job . A good one . How much do you make at this good job ? $ 475 a week , plus tips . How would you like to make $ 2,000 a week plus room and board ? - When do I show up ? - Tomorrow morning , 7AM . You 'll be driving Clark Devlin , Mr. Tong . Good day , miss . Now , you ! Out of here ! Good morning , Mr. Tong . You put your face on without me , huh ? Please , have a seat . Those are the house rules . Memorize them . Especially number one . " Never talk directly to Mr. Devlin . " Any questions , you 'll find the answers in there . And if I were you , I 'd get rid of the mildew on the chin . - My soul patch ? - Yeah . You like working for this Devlin guy ? I don 't work for him . I 'm not a professional driver , but I 'd always believed that thing you 're staring into is for monitoring traffic , not passengers . Am I wrong ? While I 'm really enjoying our time together , shall we try moving ? Wallace has been my partner for years . Something 's happened to him . He wouldn 't just disappear . You get your job done and find my partner . - Tell me how . - You 're the head of an intelligence agency . Be intelligent . - I don 't understand . - Call me back when you do understand . Did we just take the Balsam Road exit ? Of course . You have to take the surface street . Sorry . Did you get a copy of the rules ? Did you read them ? Jimmy , let me tell you something , my friend . I hate the rules . Take Grant Boulevard all the way . The lights are timed . Thank you . And , Jimmy , crank the music up . Yes , sir . Deputy Director Chalmers , ladies , gentlemen , I present to you Special Agent Wallace . Deceased two days , 14 hours , - five minutes , approximately . - Interesting . Why don 't you tell me a little about him ? Well , in simplest terms , he drowned in his bathtub . Contusion here suggests he hit his head , fell prone , unconscious . The man infiltrated a Serbian death squad with not even a scratch . - He goes down in a bathtub ? - Life 's a bitch . Want to put him back in the fridge ? He didn 't drown , sir . He was murdered . Does that make life a little less bitchy ? - And you would be ? - That 's Del Blaine , sir . She 's having a filter installed between her brain and mouth next week . So you don 't think he drowned ? Well , there was water in his lungs , but the pulmonary vein was filled with collapsed platelets , indicative of dehydration . He died of thirst . - Thirst . - It wasn 't just city tap water . The mineral profile fit high-end bottled water , but what was weird was it contained a strain of bacteria that I , so far , haven 't been able to culture . Anyway , uh ... didn 't mean to interrupt . Ooo . The woman seems to know a lot about water . Yeah . She thinks she knows a lot about a lot of things . We have a special situation in the field . I think we could use your talents . You interested ? - When do I start ? - You ever hear of Clark Devlin ? - Rumors and innuendo . - - Del , I could tell you a thing or two - about Clark Devlin . - Think we could keep our minds out of the gutter for about a second ? Meet me upstairs in an hour . You might just become Clark Devlin 's next partner . I 'm gonna need that Gerris marginalis as soon as possible . My contacts in Guatemala have what you 're looking for . Good . And , meanwhile I 'll take one of these beautiful Uticella marginalis . Just gorgeous . - Now , you 're gonna call me ? - Is your phone number on file ? I 'm having trouble with the phones . It might be better if you dropped it off yourself . - It may take a while . - Familiarize yourself with the route . There 's a little gathering at my house tonight , a fundraiser for the Natural History Museum . I would so love to have you . - Should I send a car ? - I drive myself . Admirable . Eight o 'clock . And , uh , be sure not to wear anything too distracting , or no one will get their checkbooks out . How did you learn to be so smooth ? I 've seen the way you drive . You have the same instincts I do . You lack confidence . The girl in the art gallery 's not beyond you , you know . - You know about her ? - Every time we leave the house , we go by the art gallery and slow down . You just need a little polish . - I 'll never be a Clark Devlin . - Don 't tell anyone this , but there 's a lot less to Clark than meets the eye . I 've got a couple of good lines and very expensive suits . Apart from that , we 're exactly the same . How about a couple hundred million ? Trust me . Ninety percent of it is the clothes . The other ten percent ? The other ten percent 's in there . You 've got plenty of it . - Oh . Mr. Devlin , can I ask you a big favor ? - Yeah ? Can I stop wearing my hat ? - All right . - Thank you . No , just stay smooth . Remember , smooth . Thank you . Steena , Devlin . This driver , this Jimmy , I like him . Let 's get him a proper suit . Something sexy . You pick it out . All right . Always a delight talking to you , too , darling . - Home , James . - Absolutely , Mr. Devlin . - Watch your step . - Thank you , sir . This definitely not a rental . Hello . My name 's Clark Devlin . Would you like to dance ? Would you like to dance ? Admirable . There is just one rule : Never touch my tuxedo . - I didn 't . - Good . - Don 't . - Yes , sir . Jimmy , get the car . Let 's go for dinner . Yes , sir . What 'll you have ? It 's my treat . Anything . Two Whoppers , hold the onion , extra ketchup . Toast the bottom bun only , medium well done . Two large fries , extra well-done . Two chocolate milkshakes , however the chef likes . That 's it . Your order 's ready . Pull forward . - That 's pretty quick . - It 's fast food . Anything else ? Yeah . I 'll have a personal pizza , crispy crust . He doesn 't eat out much . They don 't serve pizza at Burger ... New item , huh ? Do you have chicken chow mein ? Thank you . - Jimmy ? - Yes ? It 's a drive-through . Let 's drive . Watch out ! - Watch it , man ! - Sorry , pal . Let 's go . Why are we running away from a skateboard ? I think it 's probably a bomb . I thought you said " a bomb . " What do you mean , a bomb ? No good . Out ! - Mr. Devlin ! - Move ! - Jimmy , you OK ? - I 'm fine . You OK , boss ? Yeah . Yeah , all in a day 's work . Oh , damn . - Mr. Devlin . - You got any aspirin ? - Who did this to you ? - Water Stri ... Walter Strider ? He 's the one ? - Wat ... er ... stri ... - Walter ... Walter Strider . - No ... no police . - OK . I need an ambulance right now . His name is ... - Trust nobody . - His name is ... Brad Dillford . - Wear it . - Wear ... Boss ! Boss ! Hold on , boss . You 'll be fine . I 'll take care of you . Wa ... - Stri ... - Sir ! - Please wait in the waiting room . - OK . - I will find Walter Strider . - Hey , hey ! I 'm sorry . I promise . What do you want my mother 's maiden name for ? Last time she was in here , I was born . I 'm sure my dad had something to do with it . At least I hope so . Where is Dr. Angelo ? Where is Dr. Angelo ? Dr. Angelo . Are you Dr. Angela ? Dr. Angela . Dr. Ang ... Hey ! There 's no smoking in a hospital . - I was nervous . How is he ? - He might be here a while . You might want to get him some things from home in case he comes to . Oh . He had this clutched in his hand . I don 't know if it means anything . Orderly with wheels to the front desk . I do need Dr. Angelo . - Dr. Angelo . - Dr. Angelo is on holiday today . - Oh , my God . - Yeah . I 'll tell you , I 'm pretty excited . Nervous , but excited . I 'm pumped . I knew I was doing good work for Banning International , but I didn 't know Mr. Banning would take notice of me so soon . When I 'm CEO of this place , I won 't be having my headquarters in the bottom of a boat , you know what I mean ? Why did you choose Mr. Lundeen ? He questioned my growth projections . No , that 's not it . I don 't like his hair . Mr. Banning . So word filtered down to me that you don 't share my optimism - about our company 's future . - Oh , no . Actually , I just ... - Drink ? - Oh , yes , thank you . I just felt that to meet your projections , every person on Earth would have to drink only Banning Springs water . Yes , indeed . Water , Mr. Lundeen , comprises 60 percent of your body . Don 't you find it incredible that two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom can combine to create something so beautiful , so useful , so essential ? I find water to be ... miraculous . - You think I 'm silly ? - Not at all . - Feeling thirsty ? - Yes . You 're helping me out by being a guinea pig for a new product . Oh , I see . What a brilliant idea . Water that makes you thirsty . What 's in it ? Salt ? There 's no profundity in salt . Bacteria . Once ingested , its DNA will instruct your cells ' cytoplasm to spill electrolytes into your bloodstream , causing dehydration . It 's virulent , but , unfortunately , it 's too fast . Way too fast . As we speak , your internal organs are shriveling . - Ah ! - You 're becoming as dry as ... Well , as dry as your limited imagination . Gentlemen , fetch the vacuum , won 't you ? Thank you . Schiffer , Schwartzkopf , Sondheim , Springsteen ... No Strider . Wow . Welcome to the Tactical Uniform Experiment . Tuxedo recognizing new user . Mapping user 's neurological structure . Activate wristwatch for desired function . Demo ... OK , show me . Uh-oh . - demolition mode . - The Tuxedo will consider any object a target and act to destroy it . What 's happening ? Exit the demolition mode immediately . Whoa ! * Disco inferno Burn , baby , burn * * Burn the mother down * Burn , baby , burn * - Mr. Devlin , everything all right ? - This is Jimmy . I think Mr. Devlin wants you to clean his room tomorrow . It 's a little bit messy . I think he threw the party . - Should I send someone up now ? - No . Maybe after he leaves . Very good . Ah ! - Hello ? - Are we on ? Are we on what ? I take my work seriously Mr. Devlin , please stop using that ridiculous accent . - What ? What accent ? - All right . I 'll play it however you want . Banning is holding a meeting with water CEOs . The Agency wants us to find out what he 's planning . - What about Walter Strider ? - Who is he ? - I don 't know . You tell me . - OK . So we will meet tomorrow , V-15 , 10 : 00 . I 'll be wearing a gray suit . Your code is " nice rack . " I 'll respond , " I forgot my bra . " - That passes for humor around here . - - 10 : 00 , V-15 . - What 's the cross street ? - Very funny . - May I join you ? - Uh , yeah . Nice rack . - Hello . - Mr. Devlin , there 's been a change of plans . - But I 'm here . Where are you ? - Don 't get all pissy . They just told me , I 'm telling you . We 'll meet tonight , 8 : 00 , Pier 17 , base of the silo and forget the password . - Oh , now you tell me . - There he is . Oh , my God , that 's him . - I got to go . See you tonight . Sorry . - Get him ! - Stop ! - - Get back here , you creep ! So we 've got five minutes to get into position . I secured the rooftop . Equipment 's good , and I have to say it is such an honor to be working with the legendary Clark Devlin ? - I 'm Del Blaine . - Have we met before ? - No . - Good . OK , Del Blaine , let 's do what we 've come here to do . - I 'll follow you . - Ladies first . OK . Couple of details changed from what was in the file . You read it ? The files are crap . Uh , give me the short version . Banning 's holding a meeting of international water company CEOs . He 's trying to force them into selling their companies . - Where are you going ? - I 'm thinking . We had Agent Wallace working undercover at his factory . That is , until last week . Wallace calls us on his cell phone to tell us the operation had reached critical mass and , suddenly , wham ! Dead . As you requested , a Kleinholz bolt-action 9mm , titanium folding stock with 20-time infrared sniper-scope and counterweighted micro-rifled barrel . My favorite gun . But I don 't kill people anymore . Killing ? You 're planting a bug . - It was in that " crap " file . - Go look through your binoculars . They 're arriving . Ready ? It 's critical we get a listening device in Banning 's meeting . 962 feet . Aim for the briefcase . Should be a piece of cake for you , sir . You kind of missed . In the year 2001 , $ 35 billion worth of bottled water was consumed worldwide . Today , bottled water costs more per gallon than gasoline . We , my friends , are the new oil barons . We at Banning Springs have developed a new filtration process that would protect your assets against the biological holocaust that 's coming . - Looks like we got company . - CSA would be my bet . You 've heard what I have to say . Now I 'd like to hear you . How much is this plan gonna cost us ? It won 't cost you a penny , out of pocket . All I ask is to become your slightly-more - than-equal partner . Banning says he 's got the only process to make water safe . To use it , they 've got to give him half of their companies ? He 's trying to muscle these guys into selling their companies to him . Banning says water sources are in danger . Something about everyone being defenseless against bacteria . I can barely make out what he 's saying . Do you want to listen to this ? - What do you think that means ? - Del Blaine ! Yeah , I 'll be there in a minute . Yeah , I 'd really like some help up here , sir . - Del Blaine ! - Do you hear me , sir ? I know this is not as exciting as most of your missions , but could you humor me with just a little professionalism ? I would really love some help ... What are you doing ? - What 's with the jumpy-jumpy ? - Take off your headphones ! - What ? - Your headphones ! OK , chapter six of the training manual . Unarmed assailant , frontal attack . Begin ! Stomach , head ! Stomach , head ! Ah ! God ! What 's my name ? ! Yeah ! - You OK ? Oh ! - Where the hell have you been ? ! - Stop pushing ! - Ow ! My hand ! Ah ! Yeah ! Not bad . Sir ? ! Sir , are you OK , sir ? - Don 't let go ! Don 't ! - No , no , no , let go ! You 're ripping my sleeve ! No , no . No , not , not my ... - Ah ! - Sir ! My ring . Oh , my God ! Oh , my ... This was not part of the plan . Del Blaine ? Del ! Confidence . Del ... Moron ... Not in the manual . Creep ! Del Blaine ! Stop ! - Ah ! Get off of me ! - Why didn 't you stop ? What the hell is wrong with you ? ! How do you fall off a building and end up ... Oh ! You OK ? Would you stop that ? It 's OK . I am in the car with a psychopath . - We are not safe . - Are you upset ? Why would I be upset ? I 've always wanted to begin and end my career with a big fat failure ! Thank you very much , Mr. Devlin . It 's my first time . I mean , every mission is like my first time . It 's so difficult being Clark Devlin . Sorry . Ah ! - I didn 't do that . - What is wrong with you ? ! - I 'm not who you think I am . - Stay away ! I 'm a little over-amped myself right now . Let 's just call it a day . - Get some rest and medication . - What ? We 'll be in communication . I don 't have your phone number ! Who am I kidding ? I have no idea what I 'm doing or why I 'm doing it . I felt the same way when I took my first assignment . Then I met Devlin and life just got a whole lot better , - and a little more complicated . - Can we get a close ... ? - How do we pan ... ? - Hit the second button . Everybody warned me he was unorthodox but he 's irrational , bordering on nutso . We 'll just get ... That 's it . There , yeah . That 's it , there . - Look at that . - Move it over a bit . He 's getting under your skin , isn 't he ? He got under my skin once , and I 'm still feeling it . Yeah , you told me . What about his English ? I can never understand half of what he says , but don 't you love his accent ? - She can 't hear anything ? - No , I don 't think ... Whoa ! God , I wish I was still back in the field . How do you like me now ? - She 's got issues , man . - Holy ... - Can your girlfriend shoot ... ? - - A groin out of a target ? Let 's go . Let 's get our nails done . - OK . - Have a nice day . Dr. Angelo , Dr. Angelo ... They ran out of " Get well soon . " You said to wear this , but I don 't know . Being Clark Devlin is not easy . - Hello . - So , Mr. Devlin , - how are you feeling today ? - Not so good , I 'm afraid . You 've got a few hours to pull yourself together . - What do you mean ? - After the fiasco of planting the bug , I 'd say we have only one choice : - Level One surveillance . - In other words ... Infiltration . Banning 's at the Lanford Hotel entertaining three of his partners . Chalmers agreed to ... - ... get us at the next table . - Is this a black-tie event ? No . But I 'm sure you 'll wear whatever you want . Maybe we can find Walter Strider . Meet you there at 8 : 00 . - Water ... strider ... - What ? - Water ... - Mr. Clark Devlin . Strider ... - What are you doing ? - Huh ? Uh , he needs help . Security ! Security ! * At last * My love has come along * My lonely days are over - Del Blaine . - Hey . I know how partial you are to that monkey suit , so I got gussied up . Good job . You gussy very well . And here 's a little something for you . Thank you . Sorry , I don 't have anything for you . - It 's a video camera . - Shh . Act normal . - We don 't want everybody to know . - Sorry . - Good evening . - Good evening . - Name , please . - Name ? Um ... Lincoln . Washington . Washington . You 're a billionaire and you try to grease the guy with seven bucks ? - You think I have money to throw away ? - You on the list ? - Perfect . - Let me talk to him . No . We 'll do this my way . I 've got a T-135 disorientation module . You just stand there . Hi . Could you hold this for me ? Aw , thanks . Now , where did I put those tickets ? - What 's happening , Snowman ? - What 's happening ? - What 's happening , Snowman ? - What 's happening , Snowman ? Hey , what 's happening ? Oh , hey . I can 't believe it . James Brown . The Godfather of Soul . - Hello . - What 's happening ? Forgive us for bothering you . We came to see your show and ... - She forgot to make reservations . - Don 't worry about it . - I can get tickets for the front row . - Oh ! Thank you very much . - See ? The things work out . - One more thing I 'd like to say . It 's not the in thing today to give compliments to a young lady , but I just got to let you know that you got a nice rack . - Oh , thank you , Mr. Brown . - Enjoy the show . Whoa ! - What is wrong with you ? ! - He fell down by himself . - You killed James Brown . - No , he 's fine . He 's not fine . And Banning is gonna leave . Don 't panic . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . - Are you ... praying ? - Miss Cleo told me this would happen . - $ 4.99-a-minute Miss Cleo ? - Just go out and tell them Mr. Brown is not here . There will be another act . Nice to meet you . And right about now , it is style time ! If you will , ladies and gentlemen , introducing the hardest-working man in show business , ladies and gentlemen , Mr. Dynamite , James Brown ! - Uh , ladies and gentleman ... - What 's going on ? ! Mr. James Brown will not be appearing tonight due to unforeseen circumstances , but stay right where you are because the Lanford Hotel is really proud to present the Last Emperor of Soul . And , um , well , here he is . Hi . Hi , everybody . Good evening . - How are you tonight ? ! - Go home ! Who wants to get funky tonight ? ! - Go ahead and make it funky . - Yeah . - * Get up - * Get on up - * Get on up y 'all - * Get on up - * Get on up - * Get on up - * Stay on the scene - * Get on up - * Like a sex machine - * Get on up - * Get on up - * Get on up - * Stay on the scene - * Get on up - * Like a sex machine - * Get on up * Wait a minute Shake your arm * * Then use your form * Stay on the scene like a sex machine * * You got to have the feelin Sure as you 're born * * Get it together Right on , right on * - * Right on , right on - Right on , right on ! - * Right on , right on - Right on , right on ! - * Right on , right on - Right on , right on ! - * Right on , right on * - Right on , right on ! Good God ! - So you had fun up there . - Ugh . I was blending . That 's what agents do . Would you please stop ? I 'd like to get to Banning 's table before morning . - Whoa ! Hey , slut , thanks . - I hate celebrities - who brush off their fans . - Banning 's girlfriend has been drinking . - She might tell ... Clark ! - Yes . Stop . Get on the scene , sex machine . - Great job , man . - Hi . - Hi . Good evening . - Hello . Well , we 're all vaguely honored you could join us , I suppose . - Singing is my favorite type of music . - Admirable . Regrettably , this is my vacuous fiancГ © e . I think her name is Cheryl ... something . Charmed . I could look at you all day . You ever dance unprofessionally ... Emperor ? Let 's see what I can do . - Oh . Excuse us . - Of course . - Do you know how to mambo ? - I hope so . Whoo ! Hm . '92 Dasani . Gentle bouquet with a hint of vinyl polychloride . Earthy yet ... ethereal . Cheers . Oops . I spilled . You and Banning seem very close . Tell me about his work . I don 't want to talk about him . I want to talk about you . You 're such a handsome devil . So are you . When I can 't sleep at night , which is quite often , I step into my laboratory and I play . It 's not work , you see . It 's glorious , wet ... play . Well , maybe I can come over and play . That would be very nice . The thing is I ... I have a small problem ... trusting people . I don 't know if I can trust myself with you , Dietrich . Well , maybe we can come up with a way for you to pro ... Her name 's Del Blaine . She 's CSA . Oh , bloody hell . He drives a BMW , registered to Clark Devlin . You told me you dealt with Devlin with the skateboard bomb . Yeah , well , he looks pretty alive to me . Pretty good dancer . All over Cheryl . Want me to do something ? No . Maybe the rancid tart might actually be of some use for once . Get the boys , would you ? Whoo ! I am so bushed . I 'm sorry , you 'll have to excuse me . Unfortunate interruptus . So my long streak of love , here is the key to the hospitality suite should you feel the need to spend the night . Goodbye . Well , I think I 'll just go up to room 72 ... excuse me ... 68 , and take a long , hot bath in room 7268 . - Good night . - Good night . And once again , we end up with nothing . - I can get her to talk . - And say what ? Oh , Emperor , would you sign my bra ? Oops ! I 'm not wearing one . What is it with you and bras ? She has information . Oh , right , and that 's why you have to go up to her hotel room . You have never seen my work . This is what Clark Devlin does best . - Can I go home ? - No , you have to cover me . - With what , a shot of penicillin ? - Huh ? Fine . I 'll be waiting by the pool . Oh , wait . What 's her room number again ? - 7268 . - 7268 , 7268 ... Yoo-hoo ! Cheryl ! Hey , you little devil . What kind of bubbles do you like ? Little or big ? Hang it for me , will you ? So I know you can dance , but what else can you do ? Get on the bed . I 'll show you . Oh ! OK , Mr. Devlin , let 's see your magic . Oh ! Oh , my God , your hands are like a machine . I am never working with him again . So tell me about Dietrich 's good friend , Walter Strider . Oh ! Never heard of him , but I know Dry Martini . Maybe someone should mix us a couple . Y-O-U spells " you " . Oh . - You 're smart . - Really ? - And a good speller . - Thanks . I graduated top two-thirds of my sixth grade class . What a gentleman . Look , it 's Cocktail Barbie . - Take your clothes off and stay . - I like my clothes on . - Kinky boy . - Where did you get that pin ? Oh , Dietrich . Want to have a closer look ? I 'm sorry . Look at the time . I got to go . Oh , Emperor . - Where are you going ? Oh , Emperor ! - What are you doing ? Where are you going , you naughty boy ? I adore romance when it 's rough . Get back here ! You 're dead meat ! Come on ! - Take a bath . - Yes , because I 've been a dirty , dirty girl . - Go fill the tub . - Like it with bubbles ? - Hot bubbles . - Oh , yippee ! * Tiny bubbles in the wine * * Make me feel fine Come on , her voice reminds me of my mother . Is that room service ? What 's happening ? What 's going on under those cute little boxers of yours ? - Yah ! - Oh ! Emperor , the bubbles are perfect . - Come to mama , Emperor ! - Coming ! Oh ! Help ! Say good night ... agent ! Del Blaine . Del Blaine . Sorry . - Emperor ! - This is not what I signed up for ! - She 's taking a bath . - What happened to your nose ? - Sorry ! - Honeymooners . - Yes , some things never change . Ooo . - Emperor ! Emperor , come back ! Please ! Go ! Get going . Ouch ! Can 't you do anything ? - Why are you so mad ? - Gee , let me think . Because big , ugly men are trying to kill me ? Because I got stuck with a millionaire playboy dilettante for a partner ? You don 't care how you make people feel . I happen to be an extremely sensitive person . OK , you think you know feelings . Look at me . How do I feel ? - Sick . - Sad . What about now ? Constipated . - Creepy . - Horny . Is funny . Is angry . Is crazy . You know nothing . This is why you don 't have a boyfriend . No wonder you didn 't get anything from Banning . Oh . Right , I didn 't get anything from Banning , - except where his friggin ' lab is . - Where ? Let 's see if the great master agent can figure it out . - Banning said he sometimes has trouble sleeping . - Big secret . - All men have trouble sleeping . - Sometimes , at night , - he goes down and works in his lab . - He sleeps in his lab ? - He sleeps in his bedroom . - His lab 's in his bedroom ? - No . - Get your facts straight . His lab is at his house , his casa , where he lives , get it ? Excellent . You passed the test . I put in a good word with the boss . - Let 's go see Chalmers tonight . - No . Keep him out of this . - Just you and me . - If you 're so good at this , - tell me something about me . - OK . You have big crush on me , and I know your name is Del Blaine . First of all , you wish , and ... my real name is Delilah . Delilah ? Suits you . Hey ! - Oh , Emperor ! - Hey ! Oh , God , Clark , isn 't anything sacred ? - Ow ! Rug burns are so sexy ! - It 's the driver . - Thank you . Invitations ? - Oh , yes . Why don 't you offer him five bucks ? I have them somewhere . Nice party , huh ? So you 're the strong , silent type ? That 's the whole bouncer package . - I didn 't mean your package . - Thank you , Dr. Schwartz . Shalom . Come , darling . Product launch , my ass . Let 's go find Banning 's lab . * In the music In the music * * In the music In the music * Let 's go . * In the music In the music * * In the music * In the music In the music * * In the music In the music * Are you trying to get me alone ? Where 'd they go ? Don 't tell me the great Clark Devlin can 't come up with an answer . Although , he can walk on water . It 's a trick , right ? Come on . - Wow ! Mr. Devlin likes insects , too . - What ? Oh . I mean , sometimes I speak of myself in the third person . Del Blaine thinks you 're a freak . Have you cleaned the tanks ? - What are they doing ? - I don 't know . When you 're done here , sweep the tunnels . Don 't use the blower ! I can tell the difference . Don 't touch the tequila for me and Mr. Banning . - Whatever you say . - Yes . - Louder ! - Yes , Dr. Simms . We better hope the little ones follow the queen . If they don 't the stock is gonna be worthless . - Follow the queen ? - Have you seen Cheryl ? - Maybe he 's gay . - Cheryl ? No . Man , let 's get out of here . Let 's go have a smoke . Hey . How did you ... ? Whatever . Look at this . He 's pinpointed the national reservoirs . He 's going to poison the water ? Not with that stuff . It 's too detectable and there 's government safeguards . Let 's check out the computer . Now , you 're thinking . - Who are they ? - They shouldn 't be in the lab . Let 's go . - Oh , my God . - Oh , your God what ? DNA recombinant microbes carrying a T-4 genome . English . Genetically induced hydrogen-oxygen barrier . - Normal person 's English . - Dehydrating water . Drink it , you 'll shrivel up and die . The big question is , how is he gonna introduce it into the water supply ? I think we better go . Quick , over there by the wall . - Nobody here . - Let 's check the hatchery . You 're on my foot . - What was that about ? - Shh . Go ! How did they miss us ? Are they blind ? Don 't look up my skirt . * Baby you send me * Baby you send me * Set adrift on memory bliss of you * * The camera pans the cocktail glass * * Behind a blind of plastic plants * * I found the lady with the fat diamond ring * * Then , you know I can 't remember a damn thing * Banning 's got the bacteria , but has to transport it - from his lab to the water . There 's no way he can . - Maybe with airplanes . Not possible . Besides , even if he could get it to a reservoir undetected , an alarm would trigger the second the surface is broken . You 're really smart . It 's an act . I 'm an inexperienced girl - who 's trying to bluff her way through . - You are ? Come on , stop humoring me . Just be honest . Honest ? All right . You think I 'm the great Clark Devlin . Yeah , hello ? Steena , I can 't talk right now . Yeah . Yeah , I can handle it . - Bad news ? - Can we go somewhere and be alone ? Sure . - I didn 't know you were so strong . - Take off your clothes . - Let 's not do anything we 'll regret . - Take off your clothes . - What 's happening ? - I knew the second I met you you weren 't Clark Devlin . Take off the tuxedo , it doesn 't belong to you I wanted to tell you , but I just didn 't know how . - Take off your clothes . What is that ? - Hey ! You , out here ! - OK . - Take the clothes . - OK . Slow down . My name is Jimmy Tong . I 'm Mr. Devlin 's driver . He asked me to find Walter Strider . I don 't want to hear your lies . Give me the watch and the shoes . Where 's Clark ? How 'd you think you were gonna get away with this ? Things happened . I decided to go with the flow . - What about the underwear ? - They 're mine . I mean , my roommate . Jimmy . Suits you . These are my roommate 's , too . Go finish your business . Excuse me . - Have you seen the Emperor ? - No . Impolite to leave without saying " goodbye " to the host . - I was looking for Dietrich . - I 'll take you to him . - Like a big terrier with a little rat . - She was down in the lab . At least your interest in water was genuine . Look , I 'm here because of you . You wanted to know if I could be trusted ? I bet this tux is just your size . Thank you . We got a positive location on Blaine , sir . How long till we get to her ? Twenty minutes . I 've transmitted the coordinates . Dear Mr. Devlin , I did the best I could , but it wasn 't good enough . I did not find Walter Strider for you . I also lost your tuxedo . I 'm sure you will get it back . I guess I will go back to being what I was before I met you . Water strider . Water strider . Water strider ! Stupid ! - My beautiful little darlings . - - Gerris maginatus . Species native to Southeast Asia . Commonly known as the water strider . Walter Strider . Yes , the water strider . Very good . Very good . Well , it 's brilliant . They touch down on the reservoirs . Their little feet transfer deadly bacteria without breaking the surface so no alarms sound , and it looks like a nasty little trick of nature . Fortunately , there is one drinkable water source . Yours . Dietrich , you 're a genius . Too bad it won 't work . Oh ! You so wrong . Wrong ! Wrong ! Wrong . It will work because my plan is perfect . Sorry , Mr. Banning , it 's your plan ... and mine . It 's ours . - Shut up . Explain . - Oh . Alrighty . The life cycle of the Gerris maginatus begins with mating , something Dr. Simms is not personally familiar with . Anyhoo , the insects swarm to fresh water , where fertilized eggs are then deposited on the underside of lotus leaves - and hatch into larvae . - Spare me the Discovery Channel blather . - Tell me why it won 't work . - Yes , tell us . Why it won 't work ? This is the northern hemisphere , correct ? You incubated insects native to the southern hemisphere . So , simply , it is too cold for them to mature sexually , much like Simms here . Therefore , they won 't mate . Therefore , they won 't seek out water . - Is this true ? - No . I knew a girl once , in college , quite well . Very well . - And then you remember cousin Doris ? - No , Simms , the bugs . The bugs . Oh ! You 're not gonna believe this hoochie , - are you , Mr. Banning ? - Oh , yeah ? Ask him if I lied about the tuxedo . This tuxedo is ... It 's all right . It 's ... All right ? That is the most incredible piece of technology on the planet . And I am laying it in your big , hot hands . - Mr. Banning , release the bugs . - Go ahead . Do what he tells you . You might have a chance at second prize at a junior high science fair , but you can forget your dreams of world domination . Slip into it , Dietrich . See how it feels . The other ten percent 's in there . You 've got plenty of it . Hey , Dr. Schwartz . Tell your boss Clark Devlin is back . Drapes nicely . It certainly puts a spring in one 's step . Happy to have lightened your loafers . why are you doing this ? - What the hell is this ? - This is the moment where 50 CSA commandos storm in , take you , your pretentious accent , your jackass sideburns to the Federal pen where , guess what ? All they serve is highly chlorinated tap water . Presenting Clark Devlin . Have I told you how amazing you look in this tuxedo ? - Simms , prepare for release . - With pleasure , sir . Hatchery doors opening . Water sources targeted . Pods will begin releasing striders in five minutes . Maturation level 85 percent . - Why are you here ? - I 've come to save you . Great . What about the big guys with the big guns ? - Ah ! - For years , I 've heard about you . Now we finally meet , I find that the great Clark Devlin is nothing more than an ordinary man who 's about to die - an extraordinary death . - You 're right except for one thing . My name 's Tong . James Tong . Whoa ! - You OK ? - Uh , Jimmy , something you want to tell me ? Later . Oh . You 've got a good suit as well . All right ! Let go ! Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! X-4 genome bacteria-induced water striders 100 percent mature . Bacteria drop sites identified . Pods now opening . What are you doing ? ! No ! No ! She 's ruining everything . Electrical malfunction . Hatchery doors disengaged . - Ah ! I knew girls like you in high school . - Yeah ? Did they do this ? Mm-hm . They did . Mr. Banning , you must open the hatch manually . - Sod off . - - Manual hatch release required . Manual hatch release required . Rotate valve counterclockwise to open hatch . Get off . Bloody open ! Manual procedure complete . Hatchery doors opening . Airborne striders awaiting queen release . Hatchery doors opening . Clark ! I mean , Jimmy , help me ! I 'm busy . Mature striders ready for release . Bacteria-laced microbes fully activated . His head 's about to explode . Look at him . Look at him ! You might know a few tricks , but you 're just a sad , pathetic man . Ah ! Smoking is bad for your health . - You OK ? - Yeah , duh . By the way , nice going . Millions of people are gonna die of dehydration . You left the hatch open . They 're not flying away . - What are they waiting for ? - They are waiting to follow the queen . Airborne striders awaiting queen release . Oh , my God . For once , you 're right . The queen is gonna lead the striders to freshwater sites all over North America . Quick , grab it before it 's released . Queen strider disengaged . Alert ! Queen strider disengaged . Let 's go . Oh ! You dropped it . Don 't move ! Ah ! Ooh ! Ow . Sir , excuse me , I deserve to see this . Trouble . OK , OK , make hustle , ladies . Let 's go . Let 's go . Watch out , Aqua Lung . Hey , pal , nice suit . It 's OK . Everything 's gonna be all right . It 's not OK . You just decked the hero . I 'm a genius and I can testify for a piece of immunity . - Also , I 'm from a neutral country ... - Shut it . Looks like we got here just in time . - To what ? Take credit ? - You 're hilarious , Blaine . Winton Chalmers , CSA . I spearheaded the operation that took down Banning . - I bet you 're Jimmy Tong . - Here 's your tuxedo . You happy now ? I will be when I get it safely back to headquarters . By the way , Blaine , not a bad job for your first time in the field . - I didn 't do it alone . - She always says nice things about me . You finally do something right , you deserve the credit . Well , sir , it 's an honor to help the United States of America . I feel exactly the same way , soldier . Don 't think you 're gonna be able to get away with a bureaucratic pat on the butt , do you ? Well , I 'm hoping to . Ooh ! Man down , people . Well ... there is one thing you can do for me . - And that would be ? - - Tracking systems locked on . Anybody screws up , your ass is mine . - Block off this end of the street . - - Roger . T minus 30 and counting . Is everyone in position ? Manhole agent up . Flower lady , hot dog vendor , go . Replace hot dog vendor . Come on , hustle . Let 's go . Bird Three , the street is secure . Uh-oh . Bike messenger . Hostile forces moving in . Go on , take him out . T-14 descending . Advance operation vehicle . Bring in the package as soon as I cross . - Roger that . - Hustle , people . The package is on the move . All right , it 's show time . - How 's our package ? - I forget what to say . But you can do this . Focus . Go . Go . - Package dropped . - Roger . Target locked . Jimmy , what do you say ? The name 's Tong . James Tong . I 'm the man . I 'm the man . - Del , you tell him to say that ? - No . Well , sort of . - Oh , God . - Ladies , relax . - He 's pumping out pheromones . - Shut up . - I 'm in charge . - - Package is locked on target . Why did you wear those pants ? - He 's stopping . - What for ? Use the door , Jimmy . - He 's breathing heavy . - Seen her ? He 's out of his league , if you know what I mean . - A hunter . - Gallery owner . - Quiet . - Nice . - Clark , focus . - He 's about to speak . - Open your mouth . - Hi . - Hi . - That 's the girl ? - She 's not that pretty . - - Jimmy , smile , come on . - Move on , quick . - He doesn 't look so good . - Doesn 't look so good . - Doesn 't look so good . - Doesn 't look so good . - Give him a line . - Steena , shut up . - - Look deep into her eyes ... - Clark , no . - He 's hyperventilating . - Don 't listen . Listen to me . - I can 't think with you screaming in my ear . - Everybody calm down . - Not you , her . - No , no , her , her . - Look deep into her eyes , and tell her you had a dream about her last night . - Be quiet . - Del , will you shut up ? Uh ... I hate to say , but don 't take advice from women about women . - Shut up . - The voice is screaming in my ear . If you can hear me , wipe that look off your face . Remember me ? Hooters . Soul patch . OK , I 'm gonna have to ask you to leave . - I 'm the love of my life ... - No , no ! You 're the love of my life . Never tell them you love them . Can you have dinner with me ? Get out . Pretty sure he crapped his pants . I just want to have dinner . - Get out now . - Lunch ? - Now ! - Oh ! We 're terminating this mission . Pack it up and roll home . - I think I blew it , Mr. Devlin . - I wrote the book on this stuff . You didn 't blow it . You outgrew her . - Maybe . - Tell you what . Take the weekend off . Monday , we 'll head somewhere with interesting prospects . - How about Monte Carlo ? - Sounds good . Thanks , Mr. Devlin . - Thanks , everybody . - It 's OK , Jimmy . - Hang in there . - Next time .

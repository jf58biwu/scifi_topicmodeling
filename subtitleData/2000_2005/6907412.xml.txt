No , I know you 're recruiting but I was wondering why you 're all so ... You were there too ! Yesterday morning , when he and Moriguchi had a duel ! You understand , right ? ! He was in a fight with Moriguchi and nothing happened to him ! On top of that , he 's just sitting there casually eating a yakisoba sandwich ! Oh ... Yeah ... you 're right . See ? It 's the Judo Club that needs his fighting sense , which rivals even Moriguchi 's ! What do you say , Subaru ? Subaru ? Subaru ? Subaru ! Don 't you think the cafeteria 's cooked sandwiches are good ? Yeah . I highly recommend their yakisoba sandwich . Yeah . I just ate one . What did you think ? It was good . Good , I 'm glad . Want some ? Thanks . I 'm Shun Morihata , second year , homeroom A. I know . You 're the secretary of the student government , right ? And you are an overnight sensation ! Muryou Subaru . So have you found it ? Not at all . It 's hiding from us by putting up a force-field . We know its target , so why don 't you let it be ? Just get him when he comes out . We can 't do that . This is a school ... other people are here too . Yeah ... you 're right . Such a mysterious person . Who ? You ! I 'm talking about you . Really ? Thanks to you , Kyoichi 's been in a grumpy mood since yesterday . He 's like , " Damn it ! " " Damn it ! " Why did you come to this town ? Hey . There 's something I want to discuss . There 's evidence that they used some kind of technological method to collect data . We 're no longer who we were . Keep that in mind when you act . It was my favorite ... Today 's subjects are ... There . Cultural Athletic Festival Festival Cultural Athletic Festival Festival The time 's about right to start making decisions about ... Cultural Athletic Festival Festival Cultural Athletic Festival Festival ... the Athletic Festival representative , among other things . Cultural Athletic Festival Festival Cultural Athletic Festival Festival We 'll be deciding the rep for the Cultural Festival too , Cultural Athletic Festival Festival Cultural Athletic Festival Festival so please volunteer or make recommendations . Cultural Athletic Festival Festival Cultural Athletic Festival Festival Right here . Maybe I should volunteer ? Sure . Let 's just wait until we get there . Let 's start with ... Class Rep. Yes , Subaru ? I 'd like to volunteer . And , I heard that the Athletic Festival reps can volunteer to be Cheer Captain , so ... Might as well . I volunteer for that , too . I 'd also like to volunteer to be the Cultural Festival representative . Subaru , what are you thinking ? You 're gonna be the Cheer Captain ! Do you understand ? I know , that 's why I volunteered . You 're gonna be the Cultural Festival rep ! Do you understand ? I know , that 's why I volunteered . Hey , I 'm talking about both ! Both ! What are you thinking volunteering for both the Athletic and Cultural festivals ? ! I 'm saying I 'm going to do it . Oh geez ... You 're slow , Ha-chan . It 's because of what happened during lunch . It 's about all those upperclassmen from the sports clubs trying to recruit him he doesn 't wanna deal with that . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . The sports clubs can 't do much if he says he 's busy with student government activities . The sports clubs are standoffish towards the student government , so ... Is that it , Subaru ? Yeah . I 'm actually really surprised you 'd use the student government as an excuse , Subaru . Yeah , I thought about that too but they 're the ones who recommended it . Have Muryou Subaru as the Cheer Captain ? Yup . And I was thinking why don 't we have him as the Cultural Festival rep , too ? What are you thinking ? Now , now . Don 't " now " me ! He seems like a good guy . My late grandpa used to say , " Offer help to those in trouble . " I 'm the one who 's in trouble ! Why , at this time of year , did he transfer schools ? Anyways , now there 's no doubt that the Athletic Festival is going be awesome . Kyoichi Moriguchi , the foremost martial artist of Tenmo was at the mercy of the mysterious transfer student ! We can definitely use this to our advantage ! Just kidding ! Shun . Why are you siding with him so much ? He gave me half of his sweet-bean roll . What ? ! That 's right . Subaru is a second year , homeroom C student , so he 'll be the White Team 's captain . Kyoichi , how about you ? Want to be the Red Team 's captain ? I 've had enough ! Um ... Whatjust happened ? I wonder what happened , too . Kyoichi and Nayuta are both overly sensitive about him . Not everyone can act like you , Hachiyou . Record of the School Wars : MURYOU Go ahead , I 'll catch up .

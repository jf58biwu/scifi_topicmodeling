 Testing rumors of a biological threat have given rise ... The Epidemic Intelligence Service ... Unknown biological ... There is no official word secret extermination effort undertaken by members of unexplained underground explosions as rescue crews begin sifting through that witnesses claim was insect-like in nature . Police have cordoned off a seven-block area ... and MTA officials continue to deny the existence continue to deny to deny the existence of a mutant strain of cockroach ... engineered by scientists . Taxi ! Hey , Klaski , nice of you to join us all on your day off . Why am I here , Cleeland ? You 'll see . Over here we have our taxi driver , Mr. Ko ... who plowed into a Mr. Trahn over there ... who was carrying a suitcase filled with about 75 pounds of dirt . - Dirt ? - Wait . It gets better . - The body was totally evacuated . - Wait , wait . - Eviscerated . - Whatever . Yeah , I 've seen this before . It happens with this kind of impact . Yeah ? You ever seen this before ? Flip him . Every insect lives for just one purpose - survival of its own kind . Take our ants here for example . They spend their whole lives building this wonderful colony for their queen ... but she never comes . Why not ? Well , it 's against the law to have a fertile queen because we 'd be overrun with babies . So instead , they just die off ... burying each other in these mounds ... until there 's only one left standing . And that last soldier goes on alone with nothing left to live for ... or fight for . No one left to even bury him when he dies . Since we spent the last three weeks ... learning about various types of insects and their habitats ... I want each of you to choose an insect ... and write a report describing what your life would be like as that insect . And I want it tomorrow . Out , out , out . Out , out , out . No . - I mean it . Stop playing in the puddles . - No . - Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! - No fight . Leon . Diego . What 's the matter ? You all right ? Come on . I live in the ground . My family 's all dead . Sometimes it makes me feel sad and lonely . Sometimes it makes me feel angry . I think about the other insects . Do they have families too ? I want to know if they 're happy . Because if they are happy , I want to hurt them . Is that all , Sal ? That 's all , Ms. Panos . One more year . I 'll be glad to see it go . This building 's dying one room at a time . Don 't you think after 20 years , you 're gonna miss it just a bit ? Are you kidding ? I am going to ride the wrecking ball . Just kidding . No , no , no . The only thing I 'm gonna miss around this place is you . Yo , Remi . - Still Ms. Panos to you , Nicky . - Yeah , yeah . Ms. Panos . - What 's with the shiner ? - Forgot to duck . Your old man again ? Yeah , so listen , I was wondering - You wanna go out sometime or something ? - No . - Why not ? I ain 't your student no more . So what 's the problem ? The problem ... Well , it starts with jail time and it goes rapidly downhill from there . It 'd be our secret . Here 's another secret . I already have a boyfriend . Get out of here . You ? What ? Is that so hard to imagine ? No , I mean , who is he ? His name ? His name is ... Noyby . - What kind of name is that ? - None of your business . Pheromones . None of your - I got it . Noy - This is Remi . I can 't take your call . But if you leave a message , I 'll get back to you . Unless you 're Jason , in which case please don 't make me get an unlisted phone number . I thought I heard my name . You did , Jason , but you wouldn 't appreciate the context . Can I come in ? - I 'm actually going out . - I just wanna talk . About what ? - Us . - We 've been on one date , Jason . You can 't have an " us " after one date . You can only have a stalker situation . Am I clear on that ? - That hurts me . - " Subtle " doesn 't seem to cut it with you , Jason . You know , I 'm not one of your goddamn insects , Remi . - You know what I 'm saying ? - Bye . You 're right about one thing . " Subtle " doesn 't cut it with me . Oh , God . I 'm a wacko magnet . Sorry . Excuse me . Now , your common household cockroach takes it a step further . Not only does he use food to attract the female ... but he mounts her as soon as she dips down to eat it . Of course more often than not ... he can 't find her external genitalia through all that body armor ... so dinner ends up being kind of a bust from a biological perspective . Now ... your common female bedbug needs no external genitalia whatsoever . The male simply impales her wherever he wants ... and if she 's lucky enough to survive the experience ... she may actually reproduce . You can always tell the number of times she 's mated by counting the scars . Some more wine ? Sorry for going off at the mouth like that . I was getting a little bit skizzed . Hey , skizzed works for me . Well , anyway , thanks for a really nice evening . You sure you don 't wanna grab a nightcap ? - It 's a school night . - So ? Whatever happened to a little extra credit ? Let go , Phillip . Remi . Fuck . What the hell ? Hey ! I don 't feel so good . Ralphie , what are you barking at ? What are you - What do you want ? Just a moment of your time , please . I keep meaning to talk to the landlord about this . Well , look , let me do this . I got it . Okay . All right . Wow . You 're an entomologist , right ? That means you 're into bugs . I 'll get that . You really like these crusty little bastards . I admire their simplicity . They are what they are , no matter how you dress ' em up . - Not like people , you mean . - Yeah . Not like people . Uh-huh . Well , I should probably pay a little more attention to our insect friends ... instead of whacking them with my shoe . If you 're serious and not just patronizing me ... there 's a book called The Secret Life of Bugs . ... that you might find interesting . Really ? Oh , yeah ? It 's a real page-turner , huh ? It better be . I wrote it . So , what exactly are you searching for , Detective ? Well , right now I 'm searching for some information on a guy named Lincoln Trahn . - I heard what happened . - And he was a colleague of yours , right ? Colleague ? Lincoln Trahn sold endangered species on the black market . At least 200 species of arthropod are now extinct thanks to Lincoln Trahn . So he was an enemy . I mean , on a professional level . Can 't say I 'll miss him . What are you writing ? It 's a ... grocery list . No . No , wait a minute . I didn 't hate him like that . Like what ? You guys work on a quota system - 10 bucks a suspect ? Something like that ? I 'm real terribly sorry to have troubled you , Ms. Panos . Thank you . You 're wagging your antennae in the wrong direction , Detective . Thank you very much for your hospitality . Good night . Yeah , I had a problem with Jason Mundy . He was a creep . Just ask my front door . You know , besides rating low on your likability list ... Jason Mundy and Lincoln Trahn , they had something else in common . - You wanna guess what that was ? - No . They were both missing their faces . You know , I 'm not really a shrink ... but I 'd have to say that you really have to hate looking at someone ... to wanna rip his face clean off . This ... This is crazy . Uh-huh . You know , one of your - one of your close friends ... describes you here as ... " pathologically unable to sustain ... a proximate intrapersonal relationship ... with anything that walks on two legs . " Yeah . Yeah , I had to break out my Webster 's for that one . Am I under arrest ? No . I don 't need the 10 bucks quite that bad yet . So she 's your basic predatory lesbo . How do you figure that ? Well , she 's a babe , she don 't like guys . She rips their fucking faces off . Ergo lesbo . Hey , check this out . Missing persons . Came over the wire this morning . Poor schnook was last seen with your bug lady down at Remington 's on 88th . You ask me , we 've got ourselves a perp . Yeah . Hey , Cleeland , do me a favor , will you ? Hand me that desk over there while you 're up , okay ? You 're a real wacko . You know that , Klaski ? Yeah . No , really . Hand it over . - Fuck off . - Hey . Give me the goddamn desk . That desk weighs over 200 pounds , asshole . So did Jason Mundy . Now , if you can tell me how a 112-pound woman picked him up ... and chucked him over a fucking lamppost ... I will give you a prime suspect . Listen , Remi , I know this is probably all a big misunderstanding ... but you can 't blame some of the parents for overreacting . - You told them ? - I ... Jesus , Morrie , you told them . You know I 'm doing everything I can to set the record straight . Of course you are , even though you find me " pathologically unable ... to sustain a proximate intrapersonal relationship " ... whatever the hell that means . What , you think I ... I said that ? You 're the only pompous blowhard I know , Morrie . You 'll have my resignation in the morning if you don 't fire me first . Hello ! You hurt ? You hungry ? You want something else , Lou ? Nah . I gotta get back to the school . The gum is hardening under those chairs as we speak . - You want a box for that ? - No , I got it . Suit yourself . Well , I will see you later . - Good night , Lou . - Good night . To think you could have been building sand castles in Bali . Sal . He 's dead , isn 't he ? Didn 't your aunt come pick you up yet ? - Where have you been ? - Around . It 's after 6 : 00 . - Come on . Let 's go give her a call . - She 's not home yet . - Well , where is she ? - She said she 'd be here around 6 : 30 , 7 : 00 . - Sal . - She works late on Thursdays . Well , we 'll wait till 7 : 00 , and then I 'm taking you home myself . You understand ? Are you hungry ? I 've got some sunflower seeds and some gum . You 're leaving , aren 't you ? - Excuse me ? - You quitting ? I might be . For a while . I don 't know . There 's some things going on right now I don 't have a whole lot of control over . Can I come with you ? No , Sal . I 'm sorry . I really am . Oh , God . Hey , fellas . How are you doing ? I 'm going to have to ask you to clear the premises , sir . Really ? Security matter . Department of Defense . Wow . Why don 't we call it Career Day and you and I compare notes . How about that ? You 're more than welcome to continue your investigation ... when we 're done with ours , Detective " Klatzki . " Klaski . Done with what ? Since when are three local homicides a military deal ? I got something here . Excuse me . What the hell ? Is that semen ? Hey . Yeah , I 'm talking here . All right , pal . Just lay off , okay ? Obviously , you know I 'm not at liberty to discuss procedural matters with you . But I would like to leave you with this one thought . The days of cleaning up New York with a gun and a toothpick ... are over . That 's it . She 's way overdue . Let 's go . What the - Who did this ? - Was it here when you came in ? - No . Lou ! Hey , Lou ! Lou ! Lou ! Remi ? What ... What 's going on ? What the hell is all this ? What do you think , Morrie ? It 's a prank . Where 's Lou ? Well , I haven 't seen him . The mop closet door is open , so he 's probably around here somewhere . Well , maybe you can get him over here . No . I 'll get you out . You just - just stand back . Morrie , don 't try moving that stuff by yourself . It 's too heavy . Au contraire , my sweet . I 've been working out . Pilates . You should try it . Not only am I 40 % stronger ... I 'm like a spider monkey in bed now . I 'm sure Sal Aguirre here is real impressed . Aren 't you , Sal ? How are you , kid ? I 'm sorry about that . Don 't you worry about a thing . We 're gonna get you out of here in two shakes . Morrie ? Morrie ! Remi ! Remi ! Run ! Let 's go . Come on . Get up . Get up . Go ! It can 't be . It 's just not possible . They 're all dead . Stay here . Oh , my G ... Nicky ! Remi . Shit . Ms. Panos . - What are you doing here ? - He hides here from his dad . Nick , you see anything ? - What ? - Never mind . How 'd you get in here ? I just pull that . Narc-ass piece of shit . You two , go to the door and keep an eye on the hall . Why ? Because I 'm the fucking teacher and I said so ! What are you doing ? Seeing if it 's out there . What 's out there ? Run ! Go ! Get out of here ! Oh , man , I 'm sick . Save it . Come on . Holy' - Okay , scan over there . - Is it still moving ? Scan to the right . - Look at all those trails . - Up that pipe . - Here ? - No , that pipe . Up . Up , toward the window . Oh , my God . Look at that . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . About 11 years , more or less . - Could the nest be inside ? - Must be in here . - What the hell was that , Remi ? - Help me get this door ! Okay . - Nicky , you got a light ? - What ? A match . Something . Yeah . What ? What are we doing down here , Remi ? Remi . What the hell was that ? Are you gonna answer me , Remi ? Do you remember how not so long ago a lot of children were sick ... from a terrible disease spread by cockroaches ? Yeah , sort of . We created a new breed of insect we hoped would make the roaches die out . Well , not all of them died . Some of them kept on mutating , changing . - Into people ? - Not really . Some insects over time , they evolve to look and act like other insects . It 's a way of confusing their natural enemies . We call them mimics . But these particular guys didn 't evolve to just look like another bug or animal . They evolved to mimic their only real predator - US . Looks kind of like Lou , the janitor . No , Sal , that 's not possible . They can 't mimic specific people . I don 't know . If you ask me , that 's Lou 's face . No , that 's not possible . Fuck ! Come on . Wake up . We 'll be okay , Sal . I promise . Remember , it 's not a monster . It 's an insect . And insects , they behave in very predictable ways . It has no reason to hurt us . You understand ? I stood as close as I 'm standing to you right now , and it didn 't hurt me . What about Mr. Deaver ? Well , I think what Mr. Deaver did - Have you ever poked a bee 's nest ? And all the bees , they fly out and they try to sting you . It 's because you disturbed their nest . They 're just acting on instinct . - Are we in the nest ? - In a way . In a way , yes , I think we are . That 's why we have to be very careful not to disturb it . Do we have to stay in here ? No . Not long . Just long enough to figure out the best way to leave . Okay ? It 's okay . I 'm not scared . Good . Then neither am I. - What are you doing ? - I don 't know . - Lincoln . - Who ? - Lincoln Trahn . - Just don 't ... don 't open it . - Why not ? - Just ... Just leave it alone . Whatever you say . - Nicky ! - I didn 't do it . It 's nothing . It 's just dirt . It 's nothing . Shit ! Shit ! Get it shut ! Nicky , get the strap ! Keep it closed ! Nicky ! - What is it , Remi ? - Keep it shut ! - I 'm trying ! What are they ? - Just hold the top down ! - Get the latch ! - It 's broke ! They 're coming out the sides ! Shit . - Strap 's broken , Remi ! - Then break off the legs ! - Pull ' em ? - Snap ' em off ! Sal ! Sal ! Stay back ! - Move , Sal ! - Hold it down ! Keep it closed ! Be careful ! Remi , help ! Get it off me ! - Help ! - Remi ! Remi ! These things are everywhere ! Let 's go . They 're all over me ! They 're biting me ! Help ! Help ! - Get them off , Remi ! Get them off me ! - Hold still ! Turn around . Get it off me , Remi ! Get it off me ! Get it off me ! Get them off ! I 'm getting them . I 'm getting them . Hold still . - Hold still . - Get them off ! Help ! Okay . All right . Okay , okay . Here we go . It 's okay . It 's all right . All right , everything 's gonna be okay . Okay . It 's fine . If this is the nest ... I think we just disturbed it . Okay . It won 't hurt us , at least not until it finds out what went down in here . That should give us enough time to get back upstairs ... slip through the gap in the barricade , get to a phone . Then what ? Then we wait . - No way . - Running would be a big mistake . Hopefully we can stall it by closing a few doors . - You call that a plan ? - You got a better one ? Yeah ! Yeah , w - We find more of these , pound ' em into spikes , go out and ventilate the motherfucker ! Then we rabbit like hell ! Number one : You 'd never puncture the cuticle . Number two : In all likelihood , we 're dealing with a soldier that kills when provoked . And number three : You are so intoxicated ... the only damage you 're likely to inflict is with your breath . - What the hell do you know anyway ? - Your only chance in hell , Nicky , is what I know . Now , the genetics of this breed may be scrambled all to hell ... but it began as a cockroach , so it should still basically behave like a cockroach . Like a cockroach ? Roaches are negatively phototactic , which means they run from light . They 're also thigmotactic , which means they like tight , confined spaces . So keep away from walls and large , clustered objects . They also have sensors that detect subtle variations in air movement ... so running will draw one out a hell of a lot faster than walking . They also demonstrate a remarkable capacity for insight learning . - What 's that ? - The ability to learn from their own mistakes . Which puts them head and shoulders above just about anybody I happen to know ... including myself . So , am I gonna be graded on this later ? No . It 's strictly pass-fail . You see anything ? Me neither . All right , remember - slow , stick to the center of the hall ... and stay behind me . Keep your breathing shallow . Try not to sweat . Sweat attracts them too . - You through ? - Yeah . Nicky . Sorry . Sorry ! Let 's go . It 's not recharged . Let 's go anyway - Come on . Thought I closed that door . It 's in here . It 's going down , not up . It 's checking the babies . - Run . - I thought you said not to - Come on ! Let 's get this stuff out of here ! They 're coming . Hurry . Hurry . Just the loose ones . - Help me get this stuff out of here ! - Get them out . Come on ! Come on ! Faster ! Watch out ! Careful ! Careful ! Get something in there ! Give me that stool ! Hold it up with this ! Hurry ! Put it in ! - Go ! You first ! - Wait ! No - Why does everything have to be an argument ? Go ! Come on , Sal ! Come on . Come on ! What are you doing here ? Get out of here ! Run ! Just do it quick . Stay back . - What the hell is that ? - We gotta get out of here ! What the fuck is that ? That 's not a man ! Jesus Christ ! - Somebody tell me what the fuck that is ! - Move ! - In here ! - Come on . Come on ! You all right ? Quick ! Lights ! Get lights on ! Remi . Remi . Wh ... What are you do ... What is she ... - We gotta get a light on . - Remi , what are ... what are you d ... - What is she doing ? - It 's negatively phototactic . Thank you . It 's what ? Remi . - Good enough . - Remi . Remi ! Tell me I just saw a giant fucking cockroach . Basically a cockroach with some ant and termite DNA tossed in to spice up the recipe . I need backup . Sorry , but I got a better handle on this . - Operator . - Yes , hello . Connect me to the Center for Disease Control , Atlanta , EIS Division . - What 's EIS ? - Epidemic Intelligence Service . - EIS . May I help you ? - Yes , hello . I need you to listen carefully . I have at least one adult instar of the Judas Breed at this location . - There may be more . I don 't know . - Judas Breed , you said ? That 's right . Judas Breed . There 's a possible satellite colony being established inside the building . - Where are you located ? - It 's a public school . South Bronx . P.S. 400 . - How many in the building ? - There 's four of us . - Are you armed ? - Are we armed ? - No . - No , we 're not armed . - All right , keep the line open then . - Yes . Keep an open line . Please hurry . Let me see that . Yeah . - What are you doing ? - I 'm gonna take his fuckin ' head off . You won 't even make a scratch unless it 's in molt . Besides , you know what happens when you take the head off a cockroach ? - It dies ? - That 's right . It dies ... about nine days from now when it finally starves to death . Fuck it . Panos ? Remi Panos ? I don 't give a red rat 's ass about Remi Panos . She was with you CDC morons when you caused this disaster . You 're such a people person . You don 't think this is an army concern , take it up with whatever governing authority ... you can shake out of bed at 3 : 00 in the morning . All right , ladies . We get in , we get out before the CDC or anybody else ... can turn this into another goddamn circus . Do you think he 's still out there ? - I don 't hear anything . - ' Cause it 's not out there . - What ? - It 's right here . Right where , Remi ? Oh , fuck . - Where is it coming from ? - It 's inside the wall . How the fuck did it get in there ? Lateral compression . The same way it gets inside your stereo . Well , what 's it doing now ? Tracking me . My pheromones , probably . - Phero-what ? - Chemical markers . Scent . - What are we gonna do now ? - Christ . Christ ! - It 's gonna be hours before the CDC gets here . - And we 're not gonna last that long . I 'll stay . You go . - What ? - I 'm the one it wants . No . You can 't know that , Remi . I 'd say it 's pretty damn obvious . - You can 't . - Yeah . We 're not leaving , Remi . That thing bursts through the wall , you 're gonna stop it with what ? A letter opener and a box of thumbtacks ? - But - - If I stay here and don 't move ... I won 't provoke it . I 'm better off without you here . I 'll be okay , Sal . I promise . - Sal . - Remi . You say he 's following your scent , right ? Can we , I don 't know , leave your scent behind or something ? - What do you mean ? - Like a distraction . - A decoy or something . - Clothes , maybe . We 'd have to leave them behind in roughly the same position as - We don 't know this 'll work . - We don 't know it won 't either . - That 's not bad . - All right . - All right ! - You and Sal go . - No . Sal , this is your best chance and you 're gonna take it . You understand ? Nicky and I , we 're right behind you . Okay ? Please get Sal out of here . Do whatever it takes . I 'm coming right back if you 're not out that front door in 60 seconds . You understand me ? - Fair enough . - Okay . Okay , come on , Sal . Let 's go . You heard the lady . Let 's go . I need you to do this , Sal . Okay ? Let 's go . Here . I stole it . I 'm sorry I made you cry . You ready to do this ? - You sure this is gonna work ? - It was your idea . Remember ? The female scent is the strongest attractant there is in the insect world . I 've seen just one molecule drive males into fits of self-destruction ... ripping themselves apart ... completely overriding what limited capacity for reason they might otherwise have . We could die in the next two minutes . If you don 't move your hand , you 're gonna die in the next few seconds . Don 't answer it . - Let 's go ! Now ! Now ! - Move ! Let 's move ! - Take your positions ! Let 's go ! Move ! Move ! - Over there ! - Move ! Move ! Move ! - Bring ' em up ! Move out ! Move out ! - She didn 't answer . - You 're surprised ? - I 'm not . - Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Go , go , go , go ! Gives me the willies . Let 's back all the way off ! Run . Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! There 's still more inside ! There 's still more inside ! - Where ? - In the principal 's office ! - No , not anymore . - What do you mean ? No . We just rang it . There 's nobody in there . Alive , at least . - What are you talking about ? You can 't know that . - We just rang the office . Nobody picked up . - You rang it ? I just came from there ! - That 's it ! Back off , Detective ! - What was that , Remi ? - Come on . Just keep going . Remi ? Detective ! We 'll take it from here , thanks . Sergeant , escort these two to the holding area . I want these premises sealed now . - What are you doing ? - Containment and eradication . It 's that simple . - Give me five minutes . - Can 't do it . Every second we delay lowers our probability of success . Goddamn it . There 's still two people in there . There 's a hell of a lot more hanging on this deal than two people who are probably dead already . - Sergeant . - Let 's go , man . Hey . Aren 't you gonna take my gun first ? Take his gun . Hey , asshole ! Hold your fire ! - Let him in ! Let him in ! Stand down ! - Hold your fire ! Hold your fire ! - What 's it doing now , Remi ? - I don 't know . - Oh , God . Your scent . - What about my scent , Remi ? - It 's all over me now . - Wh-What does that mean ? Deaver . Jason Mundy . Lou . - What ? - He 's eliminating the competition . - Wh ... Wh ... - You gotta get out of here , Nicky . Get out of here , Nicky ! Go ! - You guys ! He 's down the hall ! - Where ? - He 's right down the hall , man ! - Get him out of here ! Get him out of here ! Let 's get out of here ! Now ! - Come on ! - Back off ! Come on ! What are you waiting for ? Get out of here ! Don 't be stupid ! Let 's go ! Last chance ! Screw it , Bob . Couldn 't stop the detective , sir . He took off to recover the woman 's body . Get everybody back . - I got a son about your age . - Sorry to hear that . The canisters are being put in place , sir ! Let 's get this puppy packing ' ! - Sarge . - Sir ? - Expedite the kid . - Let 's go , son . Bring ' em down ! - Let 's go ! Here it comes ! - Easy ! Remi ? Primaries in place ! Clear the area ! Okay ! You heard him ! Let 's go ! Move it ! Move it ! On the double ! On the double ! Easy . Easy . Easy , easy , easy . You 're among friends . I 'm Dr. Shapiro . How are we feeling ? A little sensitive . That 's good . A good neural response . You 're something of a medical marvel , you know . No internal bleeding . No infection . I don 't know whether to write a paper or take you out dancing . Oh , God ! Something ... Something in my ... There was , but it 's all gone now . We cleared away every last bit of it , I assure you . - All of it ? - Absolutely all of it . What was it ? Tell me what it was . Larva . Insect larva . I don 't know exactly what variety ... because they were immediately confiscated by the Department of Defense . But they were , in fact , largely responsible for your remarkable turnaround . HOW ? They 're necrophagus . In much the same way ordinary maggots were used by medieval physicians ... to eat away dead , infected tissue ... those remarkable bugs cleaned you up like little shop vacs ... and their mucoid secretions staunched your bleeding to boot . Miss Remi , I think you probably owe them your life . Whew . It is dead , right ? Looks dead to me . - Not good . - This is very bad news . This thing 's already morphed . It 's just the outer casing . We gotta find it while it 's still soft . Oh , Jesus . This thing 's already metamorphed into a new instar . What the hell are we looking for ? Dr. Landke to Admitting . Dr. Landke to Admitting . - You have a visitor . - Who ? Says he 's family . Does he have a name ? Not one he 's willing to share . Family , huh ? Get your little miscreant butt over here . It looks worse than it feels . How 'd you get here anyway ? My aunt drove me . - Yeah ? - Yeah . Where is she now ? You made it up . - You don 't have an aunt . - I do . Lots of ants . Remember , Sal . This is a foster situation . Clear on what that is ? No long-term commitments . Just wanna be clear . - Keep the change . - Thanks , lady . What do you think ? - I kinda pictured something a little different . - Yeah ? Like how ? - More yellow . - Yellow ? Yeah , yellow , with chocolate sprinkles . Okay . Check out the new door . Three-inch reinforced steel . Stay here . I thought I told you to stay in the hall . Sit here . Don 't move . Thank God it 's you . Christ , how much longer we gotta pick over this fuckin ' place ? - What do you care ? You 're on an hourly . - Yeah . Who do I see about a raise ? Wait a sec . What 's that ? Looks like your buddy Detective Klaski . Wait a second . If that 's Klaski , then ... who the hell carried that girl out of here ? Nine days ?

 Ripped By mstoll Three , two , one . Grenade . A world exists exactly like ours . You live in this world ... your family and friends ... and though you may not know it ... I was sent to save you . It 's just a game . My dear Sophie ... it 's October now or maybe November ... and still we 're no closer to our goal ... to kill Santiago and end the game . We 're in this godforsaken place looking for a man ... a military assassin who may hold the key . Whether fate or my own conscious choice has led me down this road ... I cannot say . I only hope that I will be up to the task ahead ... knowing in my heart that all roads lead to you . We 're lost , aren 't we ? - We 're not lost . - Five clicks south of Levittown . That 's where that G.I. In the bar said we 'd find him . - I know what he said . - Then what 's the problem ? The problem , genius , is we are five clicks south of Levittown . And I just traded an ammo clip to go on some half-assed snipe hunt . I thought you said you knew this Captain Wolff . Knew ofhim . He was one of the first assassins sent into the game . Top-notch triggerman . - Hey , where you goin ' ? - There 's somethin ' over here . Wolff ? They say he actually penetrated security ... got off a shot at Santiago , missed him by inches . - What happened ? - Disappeared right after that . Thought he was dead till we ran into that G.I. Dexter . Keep an eye on the car . I 'll bring him back . Dexter . Hey , boy . Dexter ! Little rat 's probably an appetizer by now . Here , doggy . Here , doggy . Where are ya , ya mangy little mutt ? What the hell was that ? Software glitch ? No . Somethin ' else . There you are . Where 'd you run off to , boy ? Dex , where 'd you get to , boy , hey ? Can we go now ? Hey , where 's your car ? Florence ! Somebody is gonna die . Sniper ... 10 : 00 . I got ' im . Circle around . I 'll draw fire . Now . HÃ¤nde hoch ! Clear ! - Bring the other one . - Search ' em ! " Hobbes , Thomas F. " They got American tags , Lieutenant . American ? You from the 84th ? Eighty-fourth ? As in the sorry-ass reinforcements we were expecting two weeks ago . No . We 're ... We 're from the 110th Infantry out of Fort Dix . Nice try , only there ain 't no 110th . Don 't say another word , Hobbes . I think we got ourselves a couple of spies , Lieutenant . - " Spies " ? - Zip it . I heard 24th Cav shot two Krauts at a checkpoint ... out of uniform and speaking perfect English . Just like these two mokes here . All right . That 's enough . This area 's crawlin ' with snipers . We stand around here jawin ' , we 're gonna get popped . Now bring ' em along . Where the hell are we ? - Not now , Hobbes . - You saw what that sniper was wearing . Just keep your head on straight till we can figure somethin ' out . What are you lookin ' at ? Been on this front a while . Never seen you two before . Yeah ? Well , take a good look , 'cause we 're gettin ' outta here . You think so ? I know this place . Incoming ! Incoming ! - I don 't believe this . - You believe that ? First Platoon , cover right flank . First Platoon ! Cover right flank ! Pour fire down the middle of that bridge . Lieutenant , what do you want me to do with these two ? Get ' em outta here . I 'll deal with them later . All right , you Kraut bastards , move ! Now ! - Redistribute ammo . - Redistribute ammo ! You touch me again , I 'll rip off that arm and feed it to you . Inside . We 're not done yet . Great . That 's all we need . We 're not gonna hurt you . It 's okay . He won 't bite . Look . He 's friendly . Mm ! They sure don 't make ' em like they used to . That bridge out there . In O.C.S. , we did a battle review of the Ardennes campaign ... Second World War . There was a siege in Hotton , Belgium between ... two small advance units of the German and American armies . Lasted over a month . I swear that 's the same bridge . - It 's a combat sim . - A what ? Virtual combat simulation . When they started beta-testing Harsh Realm ... they downloaded a bunch of old battle scenarios ... Pork Chop Hill , Pickett 's Charge . - So it 's another game . - It 's a battlefield trainer ... what Harsh Realm was originally designed for . - What 's it still doing here ? - Who knows ? Probably an oversight . Some pencil neck in the real world forgot to hit " Delete . " You two , with me . That 's far enough . - Look , we 're not spies . - Of course you 're not . You don 't even belong here . What are ya ... just deserters or ... on the run from Santiago ? - You know about Santiago ? - Hobbes . I saw what you did back there with the lieutenant . How 'd you know ? Poor bastards . You don 't even know what you 've gotten into , do you ? - We know this is a game . - You don 't know nothin ' . - Who told you to release the prisoners ? - Nobody . Yeah , well , time 's up for these two . - Hey , your lieutenant said ... - Lieutenant 's dead . That 's right . The lieutenant 's dead . - Which puts me in charge of dealing with Kraut spies . - Wait ! Take ' em out back . Make less of a mess . Hey , you might wanna get down . Quit jerking ' around , Private . - Let 's get outta here ! - I 'll be seein ' you . That 's where we came through , right ? About half a click more . Move out ! Move out ! Get some ammo over here ! - We must have looped around . - Come on . This way . More ammo ! Bring that artillery ! You gotta be kiddin ' me . It 's the same damn bridge . How do we get outta here ? Thirty-four days . That 's how long the siege lasts ... not a day more or less . So , what ? Then it starts all over again ? Day 25 ... Germans launch a counteroffensive . Lieutenant dies in a firefight , leading to the brief ... but glorious command of Sergeant Curtis . New C.O. Is Corporal Zink . Who buys the farm on day 28 ... regular as clockwork . So , uh , how do you get out ? You don 't . Game space is about two miles square . You try and leave one side , it just ... Pops you back in in another like some damn Chinese box . - Did you try to find the jump port ? - What ? It 's an escape hatch built into the higher-level sims , buried deep inside the code . Could be anywhere ... a rock , a tree . Jump port 's nothin but a wet dream . I 've been over every square inch this side of the river . - What about the other side of the bridge ? - Mm-mmm . It 's no-man 's-land . Germans hold the far bank . Shoot on sight . Hey , Private . Private , what are you doin ' here ? - Get your ass back on post . - I got a better idea . Why don 't you ? I think I gave you a direct order . And I think I told you to shove the order . - What 's your name , soldier ? - Sommer , Scott Eric . - That 's " Sommer " with an " O. " - Well , I 'll be writin ' you up for that . - Better do it soon . - Get me H.Q ... . Private Scott Sommer ? Or is it Staff Sergeant ? Pinocchio . Desert Storm ... El Talil , Kuwait . A company of Iraqi legs overran us ... because a Staff Sergeant Scott " Sommers " deserted his post . I don 't know what the hell you 're talkin ' about ! - Let him go . - Why ? Four of my men died because of this rat bastard . He knows the game . If there 's a way into this hole , there 's a way out ... and you 're gonna help us . You got it ? What are you doin ' ? Go on home . Wouldn 't get too fond of him . - Why not ? - I 've seen this play out a hundred times . Kid hasn 't made it past day 28 once . - But he 's here . - He 's just a game piece . He 's not like you and me . The sim resets ' em so they can come back and die all over again . - What if we win ? - What ? It 's a game , right ? Like Harsh Realm . We capture the bridge , we win , we get out . We can 't . Game won 't allow it . It 's designed so that nobody has a tactical advantage . Perfect stalemate . - I don 't buy that . There 's gotta be a way . - Yeah ? Look , I 've been stuck in this hole 18 months , and I 'm telling you ... - no one 's ever gonna take that bridge . - What if we blow it up ? - What ? - The bridge . - That 's crazy . - Why ? The game 's all about capturing the bridge , right ? Every scenario revolves around taking it intact . If we destroy it ... Game over . Or we get digitized ' cause we 're trapped inside the sim when it crashes . They got sentries patrolling the far shore ... plus a couple snipers back in the trees . - What about the river approach ? - No good . Machine-gun nests here and here . Then we 're gonna have to go across the bridge deck ... place our charges there . - What 's that ? - Six sticks of C-2 . It 's your bomb . - It 's the best I could do . - What are we , back in the Dark Ages ? - It 's never gonna work . - Sure , it will . Hundred feet of fuse wire ought to buy us eight , nine minutes . - I 'll light it once you 're off the bridge . - Uh-uh . You 're comin ' with us . - Someone needs to keep watch . - Right . Like you did at El Talil . I told you . You got the wrong guy . Fewer men on the bridge , the better . How many guards we got to deal with ? - One of ours , two of theirs . - Great . We gotta get past one of our own guys . Shouldn 't be a problem . He 's gonna have to take a leak at 0400 . - How do you know ? - How do I know that kid behind me just fell asleep ? Stay with him . - Hey . - What ? That battle review in O.C. S ... how 'd you do ? C-minus . What 's he doin ' out here ? What are you doin ' ? He 's just a kid . Don 't be stupid . You heard what Sommer said about this place . You can 't change anything . - I don 't believe that . - Hobbes ! Halt ! Halt ! Halt ! No ! Dexter ! Sommer ! Sommer ! Stay down . - Where the hell were you ? - I had to pull back . I didn 't wanna jeopardize your position . They got him . They got Hobbes . That means we gotta blow the bridge now . You don 't understand . He was captured ... alive . Look . I 'm sorry about your friend , but they 're gonna make him talk ... and they 're gonna kill him , and there ain 't nothin ' we can do about that . This might be our only chance . That 's what it 's all about for you , isn 't it ? Savin ' your own ass . Yes ! That 's exactly what it 's about ... fulfilling my mission and going home at the end of it . What about those men ... my men ... that you left behind ? They didn 't get to go home . Their number was up ... just like your friend Hobbes . We are not leavin ' him behind . You got that ? We 're gettin ' him out . Uh-uh . There 's no " we " here . I ain 't dying ' for your friend . You wanna play Rambo , that 's your business . I am blowing ' this bridge . Hey . Not without this you 're not . You ever point a gun at me again , you 'd better use it . John Wayne ... John Wayne , ja ? John Wayne . Kaugummi ? It 's sugar-free . What ? That 's the problem with the damn 1940s . Too much sugar . Everyone here eats red meat seven days a week . - Everyone smokes . - You 're Wolff . - Who sent you ? - No one . We were looking for your shelter outside Levittown . We found your dog tags there . - You 're not working for Santiago ? - No . We wanted you to help us kill him . Kill Santiago ? You really think ... that you and I could do that ? One man against his army ? - You nearly did . - That was a long time ago . Why don 't you come back with us ? " Back " ? Back to what ? The world out there ? Santiago 's world ? No , thank you . I 'll take my chances in here . You know , you ought to come over to this side , like I did . Food 's a lot better . You speak any German ? Too bad . We 're getting out . - We 're gonna blow the bridge . - You don 't wanna do that . Why not ? - The jump port . - I 'm sorry . I can 't help you . - It 's on the bridge , isn 't it ? - There 's nothing more I can do . How the hell did you get here ? A glitch . Terrific . Now you tell me . Hey ! Where you goin ' ? Hey ! Hey ! - Miss me ? - What are you doin ' here ? I had a sudden craving for schnitzel . - Come on . Let 's get outta here . - Wait . Somethin ' we gotta do first . Not one word . Let 's take a walk . - Hey , what 's he doin ' here ? - He knows a shortcut . - We can 't blow the bridge . - Why the hell not ? The jump port 's on it . - What if it is ? - Then we can get out . And then what ? Run from Santiago for the rest of our lives ? - If we don 't fight , he wins . - He 's already won . If you really believe that , he has . Come on . Fuse wire ! What has he done ? What have you done ? I had to do it . They would 've found the bomb . You son of a bitch . I didn 't think that you were comin back . Besides , it 'll all be over soon . Gotta get out there and pull that fuse wire . You 'll never make it in the daylight . Sniper will take you before you hit the road . - I ask you to talk ? - He 's right . - We 've got no choice . - Then you 'll be killed . Unless somebody volunteers to take out those snipers . - What are you doin ' ? - Goin ' for the fuse wire . You ? With the C-minus ? - Hey ! - See ya on the other side . Pinocchio ! Pinocchio ! I know where it is ... the jump port . We 're gettin ' out . - I can 't ... make it . - I 'm not leaving you . Go . Go ! Now ! Wait ! Wait ! What is it that determines the course of our lives ? A twist of fate ? The road not taken ? Or is it a man 's actions that decide his path ? Are we held accountable for the choices we make ... even here in this world ? I 'm out . I 'm out . I 'm out ! I 'm free ! In the end , Sophie ... I believe it comes to this ... a man can be guided by his humanity ... or by something else . Way 's clear , Sarge . I made this ! Ripped By mstoll

I KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE THINKING . YOU DO ? I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO READ BOOKS , BUT I KNOW HOW TO READ PEOPLE . IT DOES MAKE ME WONDER ... HOW SOMEONE LIKE ME GOT SO HUNG UP ON SAVING A LIBRARY ? YEAH , SOMETHING LIKE THAT . I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS REALLY YOUNG , I USED TO WATCH THESE OLDER KIDS READING BOOKS , AND I 'D STARE AT THESE WORDS , AND I- - AND I THOUGHT : " WOW , THAT 'S LIKE MAGIC . " MY MOM WAS GONNA TEACH ME , BUT SHE FIGURED I 'D BE GOING TO SCHOOL SOON ENOUGH . AND THEN THE BIG DEATH CAME , AND THEN JUST STAYING ALIVE WAS LIKE A FULL-TIME JOB . AND THERE WEREN 'T ANY OLDER KIDS WHO WOULD TAKE THE TIME TO TEACH YOU ? I WAS LUCKY JUST TO MAKE IT FROM ONE DAY TO THE NEXT . DIDN 'T LEAVE MUCH TIME FOR LEARNING . I 'D GET CALLED ALL KINDS OF NAMES . I WAS THE BUTT OF JOKES . BUNCH OF ASSHOLES ALWAYS ON MY CASE . YEAH , WELL , KIDS CAN BE PRETTY MEAN WHEN THEY WANT TO BE . ONE THING I DID FIGURE OUT WAS HOW TO FAKE IT , ANYTHING TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM FINDING OUT . YEAH , WELL , THE WORLD WE 'RE IN , THAT 'S CALLED SURVIVAL . I KNOW THAT 'S TRUE . I KNOW IT IN MY HEAD . THAT 'S NOT THE SAME THING AS KNOWING IT IN HERE . HOW 'D YOU END UP IN A LIBRARY , ANYWAY ? ONE DAY , I JUST STUMBLED IN . IT WAS RAININ ' , AND IT WAS , UH , SHELTER FROM THE STORM . THERE WAS THIS SWEET YOUNG GIRL , AND I ASKED HER WHAT SHE WAS READIN ' , AND SHE READ THIS POEM OUT LOUD , AND I ASKED HER TO REPEAT IT . ONCE , THEN TWICE , AND THEN OVER AND OVER UNTIL I HAD IT MEMORIZED . AND THEN THE NEXT TIME I SAW THOSE PRICKS , I OPENED UP THAT BOOK . IT LOOKED LIKE I WAS READIN ' THE POEM . SHUT THEM UP GOOD . THEN AFTER THAT , EVERYTHING CHANGED . SEE , I WAS SURROUNDED BY ALL OF THESE BOOKS , AND I DON 'T KNOW , IT WAS ... EVEN THOUGH I COULDN 'T READ ' EM , IT WAS- - IT WAS COMFORTING , LIKE I WAS ... IN MY MOTHER 'S ARMS OR SOMETHING . WHAT WAS THE POEM ? YOU PROBABLY NEVER HEARD OF IT . " WHAT HAPPENS TO A DREAM DEFERRED ? " DOES IT DRY UP LIKE A RAISIN IN THE SUN ? OR FESTER LIKE A SORE AND THEN RUN ? " LANGSTON HUGHES . YOU KNOW , THESE BASTARDS WHO ARE STEALING MY BOOKS AND BURNING THEM , THEY 'RE NOT GOING TO BE EASY TO STOP . MAYBE NOT , BUT WE WILL STOP THEM . THAT 'S A PROMISE . IT 'S WEIRD BEING IN A CAR AFTER SO LONG . THE TREES RUSHING BY , AND ... MUST GIVE YOU AN INCREDIBLE SENSE OF FREEDOM , HUH ? WHY ?

SHE 'D READ TO ME . I 'D RECOGNIZE CERTAIN WORDS , AND BEFORE I KNEW IT , I STARTED READING SIMPLE THINGS ON MY OWN . SEE , YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE IT 'S--IT 'S SO SIMPLE . WELL , IT 'S NOT A WALK IN THE PARK , BUT ANYBODY CAN DO IT IF GIVEN HALF A CHANCE . LISTEN , JUST , UH , JUST WRITE DOWN WHAT YOU 'RE TAKING OUT , AND THAT--THAT 'LL BE FINE . BEHOLD , THE DEVIL 'S PLAYGROUND . GATHER ' EM UP , BOYS . FUEL FOR THE FIRES OF HELL . NOTHING ABOUT BULLETS IN THOSE BOOKS OF YOURS ? WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING ? ISN 'T IT OBVIOUS ? I 'M RIDDING THE WORLD OF A SCOURGE . AND YOU THINK YOU 'RE DOING THAT BY BURNING BOOKS ? OUR ANCESTORS WORSHIPPED AT THE ALTAR OF KNOWLEDGE . LOOK WHERE IT GOT ' EM . THEY WERE DESTROYED BY THEIR INTOXICATION WITH WORDS , WITH IDEAS . THEY WERE DESTROYED BY A DISEASE . AND THAT DISEASE IS KNOWLEDGE . SO WHAT DO YOU WORSHIP ? IGNORANCE ? IT 'S THESE BOOKS THAT SPREAD IGNORANCE , THAT SPREAD DISSATISFACTION AND UNEASE FROM ONE GENERATION TO THE NEXT . WE DON 'T NEED FALSE PROPHETS OR CONVERSATIONS WITH DEAD MEN TO TELL US HOW TO LIVE OUR LIVES . YOU DON 'T LIKE BOOKS , FINE . DON 'T READ ' EM . DON 'T LOOK AT ' EM IF YOU DON 'T WANT TO , BUT DON 'T TRY TO FORCE YOUR BELIEFS ON THE REST OF US . IT 'S OUR DUTY TO STRIKE DOWN THE HERETICS . " HERETICS " ? NICE WORD . WHERE 'D YOU PICK IT UP ? A BOOK ? IF YOU 'RE SO CONVINCED YOUR WAYS HAVE VALIDITY , THEN WHY DO YOU NEED CLUBS TO PERSUADE PEOPLE ? WE ARE DEFENDING HUMANKIND FROM POWERFUL FORCES , AND WE WILL USE WHATEVER MEASURES NECESSARY TO ENSURE OUR SURVIVAL . YOU WANT TO CART AWAY ANY MORE BOOKS , YOU 'RE GONNA HAVE TO CART AWAY A BUNCH OF US FIRST . FINE BY ME . HEY , THERE ARE MORE OF US THAN THERE ARE OF THEM . I KNOW THEIR TYPE . THEY 'RE COWARDS .

RED TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED TO ME ? MMM-MMM . I GOT HIT BY A CAR , BEFORE THEY BECAME AN ENDANGERED SPECIES . I WAS 10 . PHEW . AND THE KID WAS DRUNK , DRIVING A WRECK WITH NO BRAKES . HE SHATTERED BOTH MY LEGS . YOU KNOW , A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT NOT EVEN HAVE SURVIVED THAT ACCIDENT . GLASS HALF FULL ? YES . I DON 'T SEE IT THAT WAY AT ALL . IF IT HADN 'T BEEN FOR THE DEATH , I WOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO A HOSPITAL , MY LEGS WOULD HAVE BEEN PUT IN CASTS . OVER TIME , I 'D BE GOOD AS NEW . SO , YOUR LEGS , THEY DIDN 'T HEAL PROPERLY ? AND I TRY NOT TO BE BITTER , AND PLAY THE HAND I 'M DEALT , AND ... SOMETIMES , I JUST HOPE THAT THERE IS NO GOD , 'CAUSE IF THERE IS , HE IS ONE CRUEL SON OF A BITCH . YOU 'VE GOT A LOT GOING FOR YOU , MAGGIE . IS THAT SO ? YEAH . Y-YOU 'RE VERY CREATIVE , YOU 'RE BEAUTIFUL , SMART . YOU 'VE GOT A GREAT GUY IN RED , AND HE LOVES YOU . I 'M SORRY , JEREMIAH . COUNTING YOUR BLESSINGS WHEN YOU FEEL THAT YOU 'VE BEEN CURSED IS A LOT HARDER THAN YOU COULD POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND . THAT 'S WHY I DON 'T PRETEND TO UNDERSTAND MUCH OF ANYTHING . AND RED 'S GREAT ... THE ONLY ONE WHO REALLY LOVED ME , LOVED ME UNCONDITIONALLY , WAS MY FATHER , AND ALL I 'VE GOT LEFT OF HIM IS IN THAT FUCKING BOX . SOUNDS TO ME LIKE DUMPING THESE ASHES IS , UH ... MEANS MORE THAN JUST KEEPING A PROMISE . I 'VE BEEN WAITING TO DO IT FOR SO LONG . AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT 'S OVER ? I KNOW IT WON 'T CHANGE THE PAST . OH , HELL , MAGGIE , THERE IS NO PAST . THERE 'S JUST SHADOWS WE CALL MEMORIES . THERE 'S NO FUTURE , EITHER . THE OCCASIONAL GLIMMER OF HOPE . ALL WE REALLY HAVE A SHOT AT HOLDING ON TO IS RIGHT HERE , RIGHT NOW . YOU FOLKS REALLY BELIEVE IF YOU JUST RUN AND HIDE , THESE THUGS ARE GONNA LOSE INTEREST AND LET YOU KEEP ALL THIS ? IT 'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN , PEOPLE . THEY 'RE GONNA COME BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN , EATING AWAY AT ALL OF THESE TREASURES LIKE LOCUSTS IN THE WHEAT FIELD . AND THEY 'RE NOT GOING TO STOP UNTIL EVERY GRAIN IS GONE , TILL EVERY BOOK IS BURNED , TILL EVERY WORD IS ERASED . AND WHEN THEY 'RE DONE , THEY 'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT TOWN , TO THE NEXT LIBRARY . I CAN SEE IT NOW . PARENTS TELLING THEIR KIDS : " WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE , WE HAD THESE THINGS CALLED BOOKS . " LOOK AT YOURSELF . THOSE GUYS DAMN NEAR KILLED YOU . JUST ' CAUSE YOU 'RE CRAZY ENOUGH TO TAKE ' EM ON DOESN 'T MEAN WE ARE . IT 'S NOT MY SACRIFICE THAT MEANS A DAMN THING . LOOK AT EDGAR HERE . PLEASE- - NO , NO , EDGAR , THEY NEED TO KNOW . THIS MAN CANNOT READ ! NOW , THINK ABOUT THAT . BUT HE DOESN 'T HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO READ TO KNOW THAT THESE BOOKS , THAT ALL BOOKS , FEED US . THEY NURTURE US . NOW , HERE 'S A MAN WHO 'S STARVING FOR THAT KIND OF NOURISHMENT , AND WHAT DOES HE DO ? HE DEVOTES HIMSELF TO FEEDING YOU . WE DIDN 'T KNOW , ALL RIGHT ? IT 'S NOT LIKE WE DON 'T APPRECIATE IT . I MEAN , WE 'D DO ANYTHING FOR EDGAR . ANYTHING BUT TO KEEP HIS LIFE FROM BECOMING MEANINGLESS . WHEN THE BIG DEATH HAPPENED , IT WAS LIKE A HUGE CLEAVER CAME DOWN AND CHOPPED HISTORY IN 2 , SEPARATED US FROM EVERYTHING THAT CAME BEFORE . NOW , HOW ARE WE TO KNOW WHERE WE 'RE GOING IF WE DON 'T KNOW WHERE WE 'VE BEEN ? THESE BOOKS ARE OUR BRIDGE TO OUR PAST . THEY ALLOW US TO TOUCH OTHER LIVES , GENERATION UPON GENERATION : ARTISTS , PHILOSOPHERS , POETS . WE LET THEM DIE , WE 'RE BURNING THOSE BRIDGES . WE LET THESE WORDS DIE , WE ARE KILLING OUR HISTORY AS WELL AS OUR FUTURE . THESE ASSHOLES ARE COMING BACK , AND IF WE DON 'T PULL TOGETHER , WE LOSE . IT 'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT . WE LOSE . OK , THAT 'S ABOUT AS FAR AS WE CAN GO IN THE TRUCK . LOOKS LIKE WE 'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO THE LAST 2 , MAYBE 3 MILES ON FOOT . WHAT DO YOU THINK ? YOU GOT IT . WELL , I WISH I COULD TELL YOU THE CHAIR WOULD HELP , BUT TRAILS LIKE THIS , IT 'S PRETTY MUCH USELESS . THAT 'S NO PROBLEM , MAGGIE . WE 'LL JUST FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CARRY YOU , RIGHT , JEREMIAH ? RIGHT , RIGHT . UH , SURE . YOU KNOW WHAT ? I GOT SOME ROPES IN THE BACK , A BIG PIECE OF CANVAS . MAYBE WE COULD , UH , CUT SOME LIMBS AND RIG UP SOME KIND OF SLING . YOU SORRY YOU SIGNED ON FOR THIS , JEREMIAH ? WHO , ME ? NO . THERE 'S NOTHING I LIKE MORE THAN A CHALLENGE . THAT 'S ABOUT THE ONLY THING I PROMISE I CAN DELIVER . RIGHT . YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO DO THAT , KURDY . NOW EVERYBODY KNOWS . EDGAR , IT 'S IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE SACRIFICES YOU 'RE MAKING HERE . SUCH A FREAKIN ' FOOL . HEY , THAT 'S BULLSHIT . HEY , CAN YOU JUST PLEASE KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN ? AND THEN MAYBE JUST LEAVE ME ALONE . LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING , EDGAR . THIS WALL IS ABOUT TO COME DOWN RIGHT NOW . DO YOU HEAR ME ? I 'VE TRIED . IT 'S NO USE . I 'VE TRIED . LOOK , I--I--I HAVE SOME SORT OF LEARNING BLOCK . I 'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO READ , AND THAT 'S--THAT 'S JUST THE WAY IT IS . LOOK , WHATEVER YOUR PROBLEM IS , EDGAR , IT 'S NOT AS STUBBORN AS ME . WE MADE IT . THERE 'S THE RIVER . YOU GOT THOSE ASHES , MAGGIE ? NO , I CAN 'T . WHAT DO YOU MEAN , YOU CAN 'T ? I MEAN , WE CAME HERE SO YOU COULD SPREAD THE ASHES IN THE RIVER . YES , IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER . THAT 'S WHAT I PROMISED . WE 'LL TAKE THAT . WHOA . UH ... AND DID I MENTION YOU HAD A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR , MAGGIE ? OK , NOW , WE 'RE GONNA START NICE AND SIMPLE , ALL RIGHT ? YOU GOT TIME , AND I GOT TIME , SO NO PRESSURE . NOW ... FOR THE FIRST TIME OUT , I 'M GONNA DO THE READING , AND YOU LOOK AT EACH WORD I POINT TO . HERE WE GO . " MY CAT " IS SMALL . " YOUR DOG IS BIG . " MY CAT CAN RUN . YOUR DOG CAN DIG .

MMM-HMM . IT 'S WHAT I PROMISED MY FATHER THE LAST TIME HE TOOK ME OUT IN THE GONDOLA . I DIDN 'T COME ALL THIS WAY TO KEEP HALF A PROMISE . THIS AIN 'T GOING ANYWHERE , UNLESS YOU GOT SOMETHING TO BREAK A CHAIN . WELL , I 'LL BE DAMNED . GUYS , I HATE TO BE THE ONE TO MENTION THIS , BUT , YOU KNOW , IF YOU STAND ON THE SIDE AND FLING THOSE ASHES OUT , THEY 'LL FLOAT DOWN THE MIDDLE . IT 'LL PRETTY MUCH BE THE SAME . I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU LIKED A CHALLENGE . CHALLENGE , YES . SUICIDE , NOT TODAY . WHAT THE HELL IS IT , ANYWAY ? IT 'S AN OLD MINING RIG . THEY USED IT TO TAKE SUPPLIES BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE RIVER . THAT 'S HOW WE USED TO GET TO OUR CABIN . WELL , IF IT WAS OLD THEN , IT 'S ANCIENT NOW . LOOKS PRETTY STRONG TO ME . YEAH , THAT 'S THE BASKET . IT 'S THE CABLE I 'M WORRIED ABOUT . IS THIS SOMETHING THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO DO , MAGGIE ? YES , I 'M REALLY SURE THIS IS SOMETHING I WANT TO DO . OK , GIVE ME THOSE ASHES . I 'M TAKING A RIDE . NO WAY . SHE WANTS ME TO DO IT . CAN I SPEAK FOR MYSELF , PLEASE ? LOOK , MY FATHER TOOK ME OUT IN THE BASKET A HUNDRED TIMES , AND THIS IS MY THING . IF ANYBODY 'S GONNA RISK THEIR LIFE , IT 'S GONNA BE ME . MAGGIE , YOU 'RE CRAZY . HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN ME , RED ? 6 MONTHS . AND WHAT ARE THE CHANCES I 'M GONNA CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT THIS ? ZERO . THANK YOU . OK , WELL , I 'M GOING WITH YOU . I CAN DO IT BY MYSELF . HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN ME , RED ? HE 'S GOING WITH YOU , MAGGIE . THANK YOU . " W-WHERE " IS MY G-G-GOD ?

WELL , LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT HISTORY , SOMETHING I LEARNED FROM BOOKS . PEOPLE LIKE YOU ALWAYS MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE . AND WHAT MISTAKE IS THAT , MY LEARNED FRIEND ? YOU DON 'T OFFER ANYTHING POSITIVE . YOUR WHOLE MESSAGE IS NEGATIVE : " BOOKS ARE THE ENEMY . INTELLECTUALS ARE THE ENEMY . " THERE 'S NEVER BEEN A MOVEMENT THAT RAN ON HATE ALONE THAT DIDN 'T RUN OUT OF STEAM . MAYBE YOU UNDERESTIMATE HOW MUCH STEAM WE 'VE GOT . MAYBE YOU DON 'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STEAM AND HOT AIR . STORYTIME 'S OVER . WHAT 'S THE MATTER ? YOU DIDN 'T GET ENOUGH OF A BEATING LAST TIME ? I 'M NOT GONNA LET YOU DO THIS .

 sonpyong 1975 I 'm not supposed to be wasting my time on a rabbit drumstick . Here , have the front legs then . Eun-ji . There 's an old saying that says send horses to an open plain , and send people to big cities . In short , whether you 're human or animal , you need to get out in the open and mix with the crowd . So we 're going to seoul ? Catch what I 'm saying here . Not us , me . I don 't know who said it , but I sure have respect for the guy . And that 's why I need to get out of here . This place isn 't for YOUN Min-jae . You understand , right ? Why do you always have to cry like that ? I swear on this snow . I 'II be back in a year on a snowy day like today . You trust me , right ? Look . You trust me , right ? You know how true our love is . How do you do ? Go home . The shades aren 't too dark ? They 're just fine . I told you . What are you doing ? Your collars are up . Get with it . This is a fad in seoul . What ? I 'm just worried . About what ? girls in seoul will all chase after you . Eun-ji , you 're more beautiful than most girls in seoul . AII they have is make-up . Have a good day . Go home now , I 'II see you . I 'II see you soon , okay ? You have to let go . There 's nothing in it . Let go . The train 's here . Let go . I 'm leaving to better my Iife . What are you doing ? Come on , please . Eun-ji , Iet go . Min-jae , Min-jae . Don 't worry . Just go home . I 'II come back looking good , - Min-jae - so don 't worry and go home Eun-ji , don 't worry and just go , okay ? I 'II be waiting for you . Just go now . I 'II be waiting for you . 1980 Hey Axe , didn 't I tell you to get out of my way ? Come on , just let me go . Let me go ! Boss , I 'm here . Boss ! It 's me , Min-jae . relax . calm down and come sit . What did you tell me when we first met ? You said you wanted to live in style , right ? And that 's why you said you wanted to become a gangster . And now you want out ? You 'II just leave us ? Why ? I thought I 'd live in style if I worked for you . But evidently , there 's no style . I want to end my thug life here . So then what ? What will you do ? I 'm going to become a philanderer . I 'm going to seduce rich women and get them to pay up . You may go now . - Boss ! - Just go . Thank you , boss . One more thing , Min-jae . I couId careless if you become a philanderer or a playboy . Just don 't tell anyone you worked for me . It 's a goddamn shame . Boss , you sure you should let him go like that ? He 's a catch , but he 's no thug material . The kid has too much heart . Sister dear ... Love is eternal . Imagine if there were no love in our lives . I just can 't stand people that try to buy love . - Sister . - Yeah ? You believe in love , right ? - Thanks . - What for ? You 're right . Love is eternal . I must 've lost it . My husband didn 't hit me out of hate . It was probably all out of love . And he probably stomped on me without knowing that it was me . He probably knew . Thanks to you , I regained my rationality . Thank you so much . - No , you see ... - Have a good life , honey . Sister . It 's way too late . I need to go fix him dinner . Wait , I didn 't have dinner either . Fuck . You 're no good as a philanderer . You should become a marriage counselor . Shut up . You need to stop that love bull shit . Just get straight to the point . And look , if you 're trying to play the game , You don 't want to be all nice . Get to the point . I got some good stuff . Wanna check it out ? Thought I almost had it this time . - It doesn 't hurt to look . - Hey , Dong-shik . I 'm just trying to be a humane phiIanderer , you know . I mean , being a philanderer is a service-centric profession . But then we got all these inhumane suckers , you know . especially for you two , I 'm willing to offer you the best , and the most advanced , you know ? - Get out . - For almost nothing . I said , leave . Good day . Just watch . I 'II get another chance . Sure . That 's what dreams are for . I 'm telling you . I 'II find someone , hit it big , and live in style . You 'II see . Hey , Dong-shik . I 'II show you how it 's done today . She 's mine . It 'd be great if you could help , but if not , I have a plan . Just remember when you first came to our store . If I blurt it out , you know your old man won 't be happy . We 'II talk over a drink . What an honor to be getting a drink from Hae-mi . That 's for your medical bill . If you 're thinking the old Hae-mi , think again . I make a call , you 're dead . Keep calling if you want money for medical bills . I can 't pay you a penny other than medical expense . You bitch ! Since when did you ... turn all arrogant and condescending . You fuckin ' whore ! Who the hell are you ? Fuck ... Let 's run , ma 'am ! Get him ! It should be safe here . This place is temporarily closed . You 're all wet . Ma 'am , if it weren 't for me today , you would 've gotten in big trouble . Choi back there ... he 's known for beating women . Anyway , he must 've really loved you , huh ? Stupid bastard . Ma 'am , love is eternal . Imagine if there were no love in our lives . You believe in love , right ? Ma 'am ! well ... uhhh ... You ! AII you do is rip off women ? I don 't rip off anything . You said you would go hit it big in seoul . And all you are is a philanderer ? What did you used to tell me ? Wait , because you 'II be back ? It 's been five years since you left . Eun-ji . It 's really you , huh ? Wait a second . Is it really you ? Was it that hard to make a call ? No ... I never crossed your mind ? Of course , I did . I thought you were dead . You know what , it wouId 've been better if you were dead . What 's this now ? well ... I thought of killing myself . But it 's me we 're talking about . You know , YOUN Min-jae . Remember ? I wanted to hit it big and live with you till death do us part . Has it really been five years ? One thing though , do you have to be that rude to me ? What 's wrong , Eun-ji ? I 'm OH Hae-mi . The Eun-ji you know died five years ago . What ? Eun-ji ? Hey , Eun-ji . Eun-ji , you can 't just leave like this . Let 's talk and catch up . Hey , Eun-ji . Locked , huh ? Hey , roll down the window for a sec . Eun-ji ! Come on , roll down the window !

So you were living happily while my family was getting screwed . No , man . I 'm barely getting by . You bastard ! Do you know what happened to my dick after I took the pills you sold me ? It won 't get hard and it 's been sleeping ever since . It 's sleeping ? - It won 't get up . - really ? - No more erection . - None ? I turn impotent overnight . My wife hits it off with this guy next door . I 'd have to kill you to make up for what I 've been through . Anyway , you 're dead today . Come here ! Hey , drugs cause different reactions on different people . What ? Don 't come near me . I 'm gonna run . How fast do you run a hundred meters ? Thirteen seconds . I can do that in twelve seconds flat . I ask for your mercy , man . That 's not happening . Fuck !

Happy birthday , sir . Leave your gift there and leave . Hey , where are you from ? What , sir ? Where were you educated ? United Armed Forces academy , sir . UAF ? No wonder he 's running errands with a captain rank . I don 't think where you come from is important as a soldier . - How dare you ... - Wait , wait ... Then , what do you think is important ? It 's one 's patriotism for his country , sir . That 's respectable . I should have someone like that under me . Since you came , have some dinner before you go . This is no place for him to join . No , no . Since you 're here already , eat before you go . Wash your face with this . There 's a guest . He said he was a hometown friend . Eun-ji . holy cow . What brings you here ? You can go now . This house is awesome . What 's this here ? Are you crazy ? Where do you think this is ? What ? I 'm just here to visit an old friend . What happened to you ? Did you find a gold mine or something ? How did you find me ? It 's not too hard . How many people in Korea do you think drive fancy cars like that ? Hey , Eun-ji , those are all expensive stuff , huh ? Are theses antiques ? Eun-ji , are these real gold ? You found a gold mine , didn 't you ? With just a few of these , you could live in style . You want them ? Of course . Then take them . really ? You sure I can take these ? As long as you don 't get caught . Who 's going to catch me ? Don 't you want to know who the owner is ? No . It 's someone that can easily kill any one of us instantly . Then don 't tell him . Then take them . I 'm really taking them , okay ? What the hell , why not ? Fuck it . I 'm not taking them . If I take them and go into hiding , they 'II never find me as you said . But then , what 's going to happen to you ? You said the guy can kill any one of us , so that includes you too , right ? I 'm okay , but you shouldn 't get hurt because of me . You look really good . Look at where you 're living . You have a slick car and everything . Don 't get in trouble because of me . You need to Iearn , girl . Anyway , this is some style we got here . What brings you home at this hour ? I was nearby . Just wanted to get changed . Ummm ... the thing is ... Take my clothes first . Are you still smoking ? What did I tell you ? I said bad habits are better rid than done ! Once you taste something new , you forget the value of the old . Don 't go anywhere and stay home . Eun-ji . Eun-ji , look , you okay ? Eun-ji . Just go . What 's going on ? talk to me . Just go . Eun-ji , wake up . What 's going on ? please go . You 're in danger , go . Eun-ji . I 'm begging you .

I 'm not leaving this bus without him . Fuckin ' assholes . kill them ! Do you Iike it ? You can never leave me unless I dump you . Eun-ji ! Are you crazy ? What are you doing here ? follow me . I 'm sorry . only if I hadn 't showed up . It hurt a Iot , right ? What does he do anyway ? Why do you have to live with a guy like that ? Two years after you left for SeouI , everyone in town left because an army base was moving in . That 's when Butcher PaI-bong offered to find you for me in seoul . And ? The day we came to seoul , PaI-bong sold me to a Geisha house and left . PaI-bong ... fuckin asshole ... fuck . It 's all my fault . Then I was introduced to this soldier who said he could find you . He said he could find you for sure . I was stupid for believing him . If I had known the shore was this close , I would 've came already . It 's great here . Thank you god for finding Min-jae . Eun-ji . Hey . Eun-ji ! Eun-ji ! Eun-ji ! Are you here for Hae-mi ? She 's been shocked by a sudden external impact . She needs to rest . What now ? What about it ? Isn 't it pretty ? It doesn 't sting ? For me . I 'II go with this one . Get him the butterfly just like me . butterflies aren 't for men . But it 's something to remember me by when you go to seoul . Christ ... well then . This one 's okay , I guess . Happy ? Why do you have to cry like that ? Okay , okay . Let me get the same one . Min-jae . They said you 'II be okay if you get some rest . I 'm really not the old Eun-ji . I 've changed a Iot . That 's okay , Eun-ji . Can you forgive me ? You didn 't do anything wrong . There 's nothing to forgive . I 'm the one that should be asking for forgiveness . Can you keep a promise ? Don 't go anywhere and let 's run away together . Okay , okay . I won 't ever leave you until death do us part . You said you liked the sea , right ? We 'II live in a place with a sea view . I 'm talking about where we 're going to live . With huge palm trees and a hammock , sipping freshly squeezed juice . That 's right ! We 'II put up a camp fire and cook up rabbit like before . Let 's do that , okay ? Let 's live like that , Eun-ji . Sit . Yes , sir . Why did you want to see me ? I want to become one of your men , colonel . What did you say was the most important thing as a soldier ? I said patriotism , sir . Then , where should you be showing your patriotism to ?

Are you serious about leaving ? You don 't need to know . I 'm going to go live in style with Eun-ji in a remote place . Live happily ever after , you son of a bitch . I 'm out . See ya . YOUN Min-jae . Take him . What 's wrong ? What is it ? What the hell ? Get off of me . What are you doing ? Let 's go . Hey , Dong-shik . What 's wrong ? Off of me . Dong-shik , Dong-shik !

Then he would leave without paying . So I said he should at Ieast pay the chick for the hand job . Just for saying that , he tried to arrest me . So I beat the crap out of the cop , and that 's how I ended up here . I may be a mere barber , but I can never stand injustice . During the Park administration , I used to be a Navy seal , you know . Anyway , after Park 's death , things just got tangled up . KIM Jae-kyu 's an asshole for assassinating President Park That was just foul , you know . Enough ! Sit ! Next . Number 3202 .

I worked grueIingIy to serve my patients with utmost care . But one day , I met this woman who was suffering from a clogged artery . Why is that a big deal ? well , if you don 't prevent the artery from being clogged , the artery will expand and eventually result in death . The good thing is , I knew the proper cure for the disease and so I slid my rod in her clam , attempting to save her life . But ignorant people thought that I was trying to rape her , which in turn got her husband furious . So I decided to go into hiding . The end . Go into the cathedral . It 's freezing out there . Man , I need to get out of here before my son sees birth . But guess that 's not happening anytime soon . Son ? He 's just going to turn into a thief like you anyway . Shut up . His mother 's smart , so he 'II probably get the brains from her . Yeah , whatever . Like father like son . How smart do you think he can possibly be ?

I already swore my patriotism to you , sir . Give me a chance . - That dude ... - Why the hell is he here ? Attention ! You were all given an opportunity for revival at the Samchung revival Camp .

And if one of you decides to betray the group for personal benefit , I 'II teach you why it was a bad choice . Prepare yourselves . The end . He 's changed completely .

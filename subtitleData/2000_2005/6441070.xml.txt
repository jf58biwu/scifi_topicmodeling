 In order to discover the truth The evening news doesn 't tell you How many things aren 't broadcast Who loses Who is obtaining it , and for whose sake Being pure is a beautiful and dangerous thing The world that surrounds us won 't show itself All it does is force a different truth from yesterday 's on us At the very least , I will try to change the feeling of the reality that is right in front of me Into something certain , surely I 'm Asuka . I was living with Yuuki in the city of Gald . One day , I rescued Kai , who had washed up on the beach near our house . But Kai was a psychic who could use mysterious powers ! Yuuki , how do you read this ? What ? " Psi-rating . " In short , it looks like it 's a measure for whether someone 's psychic powers are great or small . Kai , whose psi-rating has declined , is sick , so it looks like whenever he uses his powers , his head hurts . Sick ? Am I being misunderstood or something ? Kai , who now lives in my house , now works together with Yuuki . Searching for people , capturing criminals , dressing up like women , they 're very busy . Is that wrong ? You were a beauty when you were dressed up like a woman , Kai . I 'm not going to wear women 's clothing again . I wonder about that ? What do you mean , " I wonder about that ? " What do you mean , " What do you mean ? " Don 't fight ! And so , that 's how I came to live with Kai and Yuuki . All right , you did very well . Episode Eight The Chronicle of the Rise and Fall of Tokugawa Ramen I 've cleared it . That was quick . This kind of code breaking is really low-level . Yeah , well , I still wanted you to do it . Okay , next one . And to comply with your expectations , it 's suitable for an expert . What part of this is expert ? Right there , hold on a second ... It 's faster to do that part this way . You really do go by the book , don 't you ? Don 't you ever think of breaking out of the box ? Do you know what " playing it by ear " is ? Stop smacking me on the head ! Especially with something that 's as strange-looking as that ! What are you , stupid ? This is called a shaman wand . It 's a kind of ward against evil ! And when you turn it over ... Amazing ! The warning of a rattlesnake comes out ! Yuuki , Kai , I 'm home ! On the walk home , I picked up Muffin and Sweet Potato . Look , look ! All I can see are dogs . Sweet Potato ? I 'm going to make tea now , okay ? What do you two want to drink ? I 'll have milk . Water for me . Tea ! I said tea , so it 's going to be tea ! Coffee , or tea , or green tea , or oolong tea ! That would involve you using fire in the kitchen , right ? I can at least make tea , I 'm telling you ! Then I 'll have coffee . Me too . Okay ! I 'll deliver it right away ! Asuka ! The beans have already been ground ! And she turned it off . This is bad . Asuka 's gone into the kitchen . Putting the tea aside , you should actually teach her how to cook . You 're as good as a pro , and it looks like Asuka wants to learn too . Ow ! Would you mind not saying such thoughtless things so lightly ? Asuka 's lack of cooking talent is a problem that extends beyond cooking . When she steps into the kitchen , strange things happen , as if the magnetic fields have gone wild . One after the other ... One after the other ... Is it THAT bad ? I will leave that to your imagination . That 's what I 'd like to say , but ... It 's so bad , it 's unimaginable . I don 't think it 's because I raised her wrong ... Maybe she just grew up wrong ? What kind of unreasonable theory is that ? Well , even I think that it can 't stay like this . That 's more like being her substitute mother than her substitute brother . Her mother ? Don 't say creepy things like that . You 're taking good care of her , right ? I wouldn 't go that far . I 'm just keeping my dear younger sister by my side . You 'd normally keep her by your side , right ? That 's right , you have a younger sister . Yeah ... Don 't worry about it . Everyone has their own way . When it looks like you 're going to get them caught up in something , the difference is between protecting them from where you can see them , and protecting them by distancing yourself from them . I would choose to protect them with my own power . Wouldn 't it be better not to worry so much about protecting her ? My thinking that family members are like shackles might be because I never had one to begin with . Shackles ? What do you mean , shackles ? I 've never thought of them as shackles . It 's just that I want to be by Hikaru 's side and protect her . That 's all . Well , with that being that ... Sorry to keep you waiting ! Coffee delivery ! This is ... I tried a blend of beans and grounds ! A blend ? It smells nice , doesn 't it ? It looks like sweet red bean soup ... Kai , if you 're going to say those kind words , then go ahead and drink it down in one shot . Please , go ahead . It 's unusual for you to say you want to eat out , Yuuki . I lost my desire to cook . I wanted to go shopping too , so it was perfect timing . Shopping ? Yeah , for clothes for Kai . For me ? Yeah . You can 't always wear Yuuki 's clothes , right ? How about that ? Hey , Asuka ! Kai , come here ! Try it on to see if it fits ! Okay . Yuuki has a partner ? First time I 've heard that . Recently , he 's been moving around in a really flashy manner . I smell something really big . Isn 't this just one of his whims ? In this city , there are only those who will let you profit , and those who won 't . We only work when it involves money . That 's true . So what kind of food do you want to eat ? It 's a ramen shop . What 's ramen ? Ramen is ramen . It 's a noodle soup . Well , even if it has a reputation for being good , after all , it 's ... Is this it , Asuka ? See , it 's really popular , isn 't it ? We 're standing in THIS line ? Welcome ! Three customers ! Right , three customers ! I used up a precious hour of my life ... This is too much of a wait ! What do you want ? This one , the one called the Deluxe . Me too . Me too , what ? Well ... the Deluxe ... Well ... What should I choose ? What 'll I do ? What 's this ? You had plenty of time to think about it , but you STILL haven 't decided ? I 'm sorry . She can 't decide because none of them look good ! What ? ! Here you go ! Let 's see ... Is this really as good as they say ? It 's not really all that good . What did you say ? ! The shop 's flavour is praised by first-class celebrities ! We don 't deal with people who don 't understand the taste ! We 're going home . Yuuki ? Yuuki ? I 'll make ramen that 's more delicious than the stuff here . What are you saying , you amateur ? Don 't underestimate amateurs . Trying to make a fool of me ? Who the hell does he think he is ? Are you serious about this ramen challenge , Yuuki ? I 'll make that shop regret its lousy service ! But Yuuki , will you be all right ? I 'm no worse than he is . I can take all the time I need . Which means that this will be decided by the ingredients ! Do you have a plan ? Swallows ' nests . Do you know about them ? I 've never had them , but aren 't they expensive ? That 's it . There 's a building in the east district that 's half-sunken into the sea . They 're nesting in there . It 's dangerous to collect them , and normally I 'd hesitate to do it , but you 'll be able to get it . So all I have to do is get that ? That 's right . All right , go ! Jeez ... Ow ! Yuuki , am I supposed to get all of them ? ! One nest is enough ! If you took all their homes , it would be a problem for the swallows ! Kai ... Hey , Rikumi . Oh , it 's you , Yuuki . What 's going on ? I have a favor to ask of you , as a man of the sea . I don 't mind your asking , but business is business . A while back , you let me eat some of that delicious deep-sea fish , right ? Oh , that . Tell me where you can catch them . I don 't mind telling you , but they 're not something that an amateur can catch . In that case , you won 't charge much for the information , right ? What ? ! Well , I 'll tell you , so give it your best shot . It 's like a picnic ! Isn 't this fun ? This is the first time I 've done this , so ... Kai ? ! All right , let 's try for the deep-sea fish next ! It 's hard on Kai , making him do all the work , so I 'm going to help too . Help how ? I made sure to wear a swimsuit too . Hey , wait a second ! I 'm going to help ! Hey ! Asuka ! Don 't be so reckless . The ocean at Gald is cold . Okay . But you 'll make me dive into it . If you don 't work , you don 't eat . Don 't worry ! I 'll pay you for the work you do . No , I mean ... Come on , change into this . Ow ! Why ? I just felt like it . All right , go ! Gotcha . Kai ! Well , it 'll probably turn out okay . Here 's some coffee , Kai . Thank you ... Coffee ? Don 't worry , I watched her make it . I see . It 's sweet . Is there too much sugar ? No , it 's okay . Now , then ... We 've obtained our selected ingredients ! Now it 's up to my skill alone ! Yuuki , you really don 't want us to help ? No ! Especially you , Asuka , don 't even come in the kitchen ! That 's mean ! Now , now , let 's wait over there . Delicious ! The line was worth it . But the soup is a little heavy . Starting now , the original Gald ramen shop is open ! Our ramen is full of Gald 's specialty seafood ! It 's a healthy and low-calorie dish ! You can 't find this taste for this price anywhere else ! Hey , what should we do ? I can 't wait anymore ! I 'm okay with that one ! Me too ! Yuuki-ya Me too ! Yuuki-ya How about it ? Original Gald ramen is delicious ! How about it ? Original Gald ramen is delicious ! One Gald ramen . Me too ! One with lots of scallions for me ! Coming right up ! Welcome ! What in the world is he doing ? That bastard ! All right , here 's the large , and here 's the one with egg ! Our ramen is fresh seafood ramen , so no matter how many you eat , it 's still good ! It 's delicious ! What is this ? Would you like some water ? Who are you ? He 's so cute ! Hey , you ! Don 't go stealing customers from in front of my shop ! Don 't say stupid things ! They 're coming here because it 's more delicious than yours ! Before you make a complaint , try some of ours ! What the hell is this ? ! Why , you ! How dare you use high-quality ingredients to get such a rich flavour ? ! You 're selling this below cost , aren 't you ? I 'll have you know , I gathered all of these ingredients myself . All it cost me was his labour costs . It was cheap ! You never said that it was cheap . Shut up ! Never mind , keep quiet ! Four more here , please ! A large for me ! An extra large for me ! Coming right up ! Wait a second , even our flavour is ... I like this one better ! It 's a nice , refreshing flavour , you know ? All right , here 's your ramen ! It 's here , it 's here ! Now , which place is better ? This place ! Oh my God ! I won . Yuuki , the soup pot is spilling over ! Wait , Asuka ! I wonder if this is all right ? Yuuki , I 'm sorry . Yuuki , it 's not like Asuka had any bad intentions , so ... Sorry to keep you waiting . Yuuki , this is really delicious ! Didn 't I tell you that I 'd let you eat ramen that was better than theirs ? Yeah ! There 's as many extra helpings as you want . And I made you use your powers , Kai , so ... Come to think of it , I used my powers , but I didn 't get a headache , and I don 't feel tired . Well , dig in . By the way , Yuuki ... What ? What about my pay ? And that 's ? Payment in goods . Eat it . It 's a high-class delicacy . I won 't let you complain . Wait a second . I 'm the one who collected this ! I won 't let you complain ! What is with you ? ! Delicious ! The two of us had already started to get wet from the rapidly pouring rain We snuck out in a hurry , throwing away everything We wrapped our fingers together so that no one else could see it That 's our secret sign So take me away from here , take me right away Tonight midnight So don 't stop anymore , touch me right away Tonight , it 's true love The night that can 't return is going to begin Josephione ... As I hear that elegant name , my heart pounds and trembles , and it even steals away my soul . You are the one sent to me by God ! The incarnation of beauty ! The fairy of the rose ! And the angel of love ! Oh , Josephione ! I am your servant ! Well , next time , E 's Otherwise , episode nine : Oh , Josephione ! I am your servant ! " The Bewitched Soul " Oh , Josephione ! I am your servant ! " The Bewitched Soul " The Bewitched Soul " The Bewitched Soul " The Bewitched Soul Or so it seems . The Bewitched Soul Josephione ! The Bewitched Soul Shut up ! Josephione ! The Bewitched Soul Shut up !

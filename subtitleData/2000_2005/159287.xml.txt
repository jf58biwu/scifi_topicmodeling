 Deep South Exciting news ! The pet license I requisitioned for Nibbler is here . That 's sweet . I didn 't know you cared about Nibbler . Dream on ! I want to put him in a sack , toss the sack in the river ... ... and hurl the river into space . But I like filling out requisitions . And these were some doozies ! Great Jah 's dreadlocks ! There 's been a mix-up . This isn 't the pet license , it 's a fishing license ! And it 's mandatory ! The exact center of the Atlantic Ocean ! Seems the logical place for fish to congregate ! - We 're in international waters ? - Indeed so . Falcon , this is Blue Raven . The goose has nested . Guess what you 're accessories to ? The sun , the sea air , good friends . Leela 's right . Fishing blows . Let 's make it interesting . - Why not ? - Yeah , cool ! Everybody kick in 5 bucks ! - Wasn 't that interesting ? - Bender ! This contest is as good as over . I once caught a fish this big . Oh , yeah ? I once caught a fish this big . You 're both out of your league ! Because you 're looking at a woman who owns a harpoon . Harpoon my ass ! Okay ! Let 's see now . Which bait to use ? Crickets ? Squid ? Chicken necks ? Excuse me , if I might be so bold . I am willing to offer my services as a bait critic . These sardines , for example , are bland and tasteless . And these dry , stringy night crawlers , though juicy ... . Very , very juicy . I don 't believe this ! It 's eating my bait ! Beat it , you mooching crawdad ! Hey , Fry . Check out my laser-guided fishing rod . Quiet , you 'll scare away the fish . Fine . I 'll head to the other side . Good luck fishing on this side ! I can hit a fish between the eyes from 20 yards . - Yeah ? I can hit a shrimp ! - A shrimp ? I find it a bit hard to believe that- - Gather around , chumps ! I got the winner . So , this is where you shop for your boots ! A couple more of those and you 'll have yourself a fish stick . A fish this fine belongs in a fish nugget-style chunklet . It 's bigger than anything you 've caught . My small intestine . Bingo ! Whatever it is , it 's 20 times heavier than a boot . You 'll never catch anything with that primitive technology . What you need is this fish pheromone . The most potent aphrodisiac known to fishkind . I am so into you ! Oh , my ! Bender , I just caught a fish this big ! Quit exaggerating ! Screw this ! If I 'm not gonna catch a fish , I might as well not catch a big fish . There . Like most problems , this one can be solved with bending . Bender , be careful ! That 's the ship 's diamond filament tether . It 's unbreakable . - Then , why do I have to be careful ? - It belonged to my grandmother . My Manwich ! Wake up ! I 've got something . And this time , it 's alive ! Dr. Zoidberg , since when do you even wear boots ? I wasn 't wearing it . I was eating it ! Come on , let 's go home . Sunburn ! My fabulous body ! It 's ruined ! What happened to my parasol ? It wasn 't here when I took your umbrella . - I put sun block on you . - It didn 't work . Come on , Bender . Pull in your line and let 's go . Hey ! I 'm snagged ! It 's not snagged . The mechano-man has caught something ! Sweet zombie Jesus ! It 's huge ! It 's coming up ! - That 's big ! - A colossal mouth bass ! It 's diving ! It 's pulling us under ! into the ship ! Wait , I 'll save us ... ... by cutting the unbreakable diamond filament . Well , at least I 'll die with my friends . Hello ? My Speedos ! Depth at 4500 feet ! Forty-eight hundred ! Fifty hundred ! Five thousand feet ! Dear Lord ! That 's over 1 50 atmospheres of pressure ! How many atmospheres can the ship withstand ? It 's a spaceship , so I 'd say anywhere between zero and one . What 's that ? ls someone bending girders ? We 'll be crushed if we don 't equalize . How do we do that ? That should do it . We 're gonna die ! Wait ! I 'll be back in a minute . - You did it , Fry ! - Did what ? People , it 's far , far worse than we thought . My fish got away ! Good as new ! Except we 're 3 miles down below , have no food , and the ship won 't work . Tempers are wearing thin . Let 's hope some robot doesn 't kill everybody ! Don 't panic . There are rules for situations like this . The first order of business is lunch . I suggest a nice lobster Zoidberg . I mean lobster Newburg . I mean Dr. Zoidberg . Okay , everyone calm down . The professor and I will work on the ship . Bender , Zoidberg : Since you can survive under water ... ... you 'll go out and find food . I better go too . They don 't know what I like . No ! The pressure will crush you like a snake under a sugarcane truck ! Not necessarily . This is a chance for Fry to test my experimental anti-pressure pill . I can 't swallow that ! Well , then , good news ! It 's a suppository . How are you doing there ? Glad to hear it ! Ah , yeah . Yum , yum , yum . Look at me ! I 'm Dr. Zoidberg , homeowner ! Careful , Fry . I think that flag may be poisonous . Ahoy , mateys ! I shanghaied us some hearty grub ! The laws of science be a harsh mistress . Robot , old buddy , could you help me move a couch ? Okay . But I 'm not carrying it upstairs . What is it , Fry ? You want lemonade ? You saw a parade ? Your student loans have been repaid ? Then how about lending your old pal Zoidberg a few bucks , Mr. Millionaire . Fry , swallow your food , then talk . A mermaid ! You think you saw a mermaid ? No , I did see a mermaid . She was wearing a tube top ... ... and she had a scaly tail , and hair extensions . - Yeah , right ! - Sure she did ! You are simply hallucinating , you moron ! What 's so far-fetched about mermaids ? There 's all sorts of weird sea creatures here in the future . Like Dr. Zoidberg ! Fry is suffering from ocean madness . Every time something good happens to me , you say it 's madness . Or I 'm drunk . Or I ate too much candy . Well , I saw a real mermaid ! And I wish for once my friends had the decency to believe me ! Ocean madness . He may have ocean madness , but that 's no excuse for ocean rudeness . Ocean madness . Yeah , right ! It 's always something , ain 't it ? It 's her ! Bender , wake up ! She 's here , wake up ! Oxygen ! Here you go , darling . Hey ! I can breathe and talk , just like a fish ! You speak fish ? - What ? - I 'm sorry , my accent 's atrocious . - Hi , my name is Umbriel . - I 'm Fry . - So , am I gonna drown ? - Of course not ! Just stay calm and let the gentle currents relax your every muscle . Did it just get warmer ? I can 't believe you 're real . I like your tail . You 're sweet ! I like those wiggly doodads coming out of your hips . Thanks . They 're called pants . This here is a volcanic vent . - The water is over 4000 degrees . - No kidding . Did it just get colder ? Tell me more about that bizarre landie world you come from . Is there water there too ? Sure , sometimes it falls from the sky . And sometimes it doesn 't . Mr. Fry , you do go on ! What 's best about you is you find me fascinating . Even if I 'm not claiming to be a jewel thief or lion-tamer . Lions ? There are sea lions on the land ? Yep ! We call them land sea lions . I tame them . I 've almost reconfigured the ship 's propulsion system . We can leave as soon as the papier-mâché is dry . - Where 's Fry ? - I didn 't kill him . You ? No , I 've been busy . He must 've gone looking for that mermaid . Poor demented honky . It 's ocean madness , all right . Sailors call it aqua dementia . The deep down crazies . The wet willies . The screaming moist . We 'll form a search party . We 'll need oxygen . I got it covered . In the event of emergency , my ass can be used as flotation device . You 've all taken your pressure pills , right ? Yes ! Stop asking ! I 've got a scent , over here where the water gets warmer . This way ! Bend me ! Dude ! An ancient sunken city ! Could it possibly be ? Are the old legends true ? It is ! It 's the fabled lost city of Atlanta ! Howdy , y 'all ! Welcome to Atlanta ! Folks here call me " The Colonel . " Have some breathers , courtesy of our chamber of commerce . This is uncomfortable and humiliating ! Now , if they could put it in the form of a suppository ... . Y 'all enjoy your stay ! Tourism 's our main source of income . So see the sights , spend some money ! Please don 't leave ! Fry , I knew you were alive ! I owe you 1 0 bucks , Hermes . The most amazing thing happened ! It 's two-for-one Tuesday at Krispy Kreme . Plus there 's mermaids . I 'd like you to meet my daughter , Umbriel . Umbriel , these are some Yankees . So Atlanta was an American city in your time ? I think it was just an airport . They had a place to buy nuts . No ! Ancient Atlanta was more than just a Delta hub ! It was a vibrant metropolis . The equal of Paris or New York . That 's right , honey . Whatever you say . Loot at these fabulous ruins . Turner Field ... ... the Coca-Cola bottling plant ... ... the airport . How could a city with such a fabulous airport end up underwater ? That 's a story only to be told in the chamber of commerce video ... ... narrated by folk-rock troubadour Donovan . Atlanta was a city , landlocked . Hundreds of miles from the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean . Yet so desperate the city 's desire for tourism that they moved offshore , became an island and bigger Delta hub . Until the city overdeveloped , and it started to sink . Knowing their fate , the quality people ran away . Ted Turner , Hank Aaron , Jeff Foxworthy the guy who invented Coca-Cola the magician , and the other so-called gods of our legends . Though gods they were . Also Jane Fonda was there . The others remained behind on their porches with rifles and one day evolve into mermaids and sing and dance and ring in the new . Hail Atlanta ! The magician ? Wouldn 't it take millions of years to evolve into mermaids ? Normally , yes . But the caffeine really sped things up . That stuff 's wonderful ! When Umbriel brought home this carpetbagger , I was against it . But damn if old legs here ain 't grown on me ! Shucks , Colonel ! It 's very nice here , but we should go . I miss me wife and oxygen . We all miss our loved ones and gases . Come on , Fry . Wait , I 'm not going with you . What about us ? What about your life on the surface ? You don 't belong here . She 's right . Sure they got the Braves , but it 's a third-rate symphony . Fry , you half-mad , half-insane maniac ! Be reasonable ! Do you realize if you stay at this depth ... ... you 'll permanently adapt to the pressure ? Realize it ? I don 't even understand it ! You 'll never be able to return to the surface . I don 't care . I 've got everything I want right here . I 'm bored ! Let 's go ! You know , Fry , I 've got a little place just outside town . You could visit , maybe ? Sorry , I 'm trying to join the country club . I 'll miss you ! Y 'all come back now , you hear ? Let 's go , damn it , let 's go ! I guess this is goodbye for me as well . - Whatever . - Later ! My home ! It burned down ! - How did this happen ? - That 's a good question ! So that 's where I left my cigar . That just raises further questions ! These last 24 hours have been the happiest days of my life . I want you to make a mer-woman out of mer-me . Mercy ! I do believe I 'm getting the vapors . What the hell is that ? I 'm a little confused too ! How do I ... you know , with the tail and all ? I 'm not your first , am I ? I lay my eggs , then I leave and you release your fertilizer . Why couldn 't she be the other kind of mermaid ... ... with fish part on top , and lady part on bottom ? Now who 's gonna escort me to the Debutante Ball ? What about that rich young dugong from Macon ? The engine modifications are complete . Prepare for launch . Wait ! Wait for me ! Don 't leave me here ! And so , in honor of his record-breaking catch ... ... I 'm proud to award Bender this check for $ 1 000 ! - It 's you ! - Yeah , buddy ! My Manwich ! - Are you all right ? What happened ? - What about Umbriel ? Turns out I loved her , but I wasn 't in love with her . Trouble in bed . It 's great to have you back , buddy ! Wait ! This is no record ! Give me back that check ! I 'm giving it to some giant orphans . Bender , you 're hurting me ! Hey , I 'm trying to sleep in here ! Hail Atlanta !

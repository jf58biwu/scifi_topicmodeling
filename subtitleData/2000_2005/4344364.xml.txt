 And in a heartbeat , everything and everyone we knew ... was gone . There were five of us . The crew of the space shuttle Odyssey . And we were the only survivors . A mysterious being who called himself The Seeker ... rescued us and sent us back in time . And now we have five years to live over . Five years to discover who or what destroyed the Earth . Five years to stop it from happening again . Oh , excuse me . I wonder if you could ... Bay Channel officials insist that the spill was minor ... and poses no hazard to local beaches . Sarah ? The Houston suburb of Lawndale is in shock this morning ... over a domestic quarrel that ended in murder . Marie Hovic was found dead late last night in her home ... at the 7800 block of Clayton Court . The 32-year-old mother of three died from a series of hammer blows . Her husband has been charged with the murder ... but Lawndale police can give no motive for the crime . Kayli ? It 's that time of year again . The Houston area Special Olympics start today at Rice University . - TJI . - What ? Another nasty one to add to the Hammer Slammer . Hammer Slammer ? Do we have to use these tabloid names , Troy ? - Sorry . Read it next . - Thanks for the lead-in time . Organisers say there 's plenty of seating . So come on out and bring the whole family . Back to you , Sarah . A killing in the parking garage of a supermarket ... in Pearland late last night has local police baffled . The victim was found dead of a broken neck next to his car ... and there were no witnesses . The victim 's name is ... The victim is Dr Naran Chandra ... one of the world 's leading computer scientists . Sarah ? Sarah ? Always somewhat reclusive ... Dr Chandra dropped from public view in recent months . We 'll have more on this story as it comes in . It seems inevitable , somehow . I mean , he did kill himself months ago in the other timeline . Well , he sure as hell didn 't kill himself in this one . Is Angela still at Ellington ? Yeah . She 's flying again with a Russian cosmonaut . - Oh , Tatiana . - No . This time it 's a guy . - Really ? - Yeah . I wonder how he 's gonna feel with a woman on the stick . And what 's that stupid comment supposed to mean , Chuckie ? - Bloody hell . - It means she 's on the stick , Kurt . It means she 's flying the plane . What the hell you think it 's supposed to mean ? You know , Kurt , if I were you ... I mean , we 've pissed in the timeline long enough to fuck it up . So if you 're in love with the girl , why don 't you just say so ... marry her , enjoy a few good years before the world blows to shit ... and stop running your soap opera on me ! You know , why don 't you take your editorials ... and stick them where the sun don 't shine , Commander ? You know , why don 't you both shut the fuck up and pay attention . This is the e-mail I got from Naran Chandra today ... and according to the servers , it was sent at 6 : 00 a.m. This morning . - 6 : 00 a . M ? - Wait a minute . Chandra was killed ... - last night before midnight . - Yeah . Exactly . Now , he could 've programmed his computer to send a pre-recorded message ... if he didn 't override the command every couple of hours . - All right . Let 's have it . - Here we go . Commander Taggart . Lately , I 've been seeing signs ... that our friends may have caught up with me . So just in case , I have set this up auto-send . Lucky you . You get a message from the grave . I 'm not very religious ... but I 'm still enough of a Hindu that as death approaches ... I hope to resolve some of the unfinished business of my life . I 've created something that you may find useful . Something that I , myself , had hoped to use ... but now it 's in your hands . It 's in a locker in the main bus depot , Garland and Fifth . The key is in the right front wheel well of your car . I slipped it in after our last meeting at Dr Mendel 's . Goodbye , Commander . All of you . When my time comes ... it will be made easier ... knowing that you will survive ... to carry on the fight . Carry on the fight ? Shit . We 've been after these freaks for months ... and we don 't know on God 's earth what the fuck we 're fighting . Look at that . - 5 : 30 . - 5 : 30 . You know what , this could actually be a trap . - Made by Synthetics . - The thought occurred to me . Well , then again , we don 't have much of a choice , do we ? - The thought occurred to me . - Come on , darling , come on . It 's interesting to think that some of these people are not people . - Kurt , what you got on the imager ? - I don 't see any Synthetics outside yet . - It 's too bad we can 't take that thing with us . - So , what 's the plan ? Okay . Here 's the plan . Locker 530 . You take this key . Neil and I are gonna go in , we 're gonna create a conspicuous diversion ... by going to the rows of 100 , 200 . While we do that ... you go to the locker . You open up that door ... you take whatever 's in there out , hopefully it ain 't too heavy ... - and you run like hell . - Wait a minute . Why me ? Because if anyone 's gonna be followed , it 's gonna be us ... - since we 're the ones Chandra contacted . - Right . Kurtrude ... anything comes up on green there , you let us know on the cell phone . All right ? - I don 't see anyone named Kurtrude in here . - Okay , Sarah ... we 're gonna go in the front door . Give us 30 seconds , you jump in the side . - Got 50 cents ? - Yeah . You gonna pay me back ? No . Put it in the locker . What do I look like , the bank ? Yeah ? So far so good , Commander . Yeah , but it 's still early in the day . Guys , guys , guys , heads up . Big green machine , main entrance . - Where ? - Heading toward you . - Which one ? I don 't see it . Which one ? - What ? What ? Oh , here . Hey . Hey ! The kid ! - God damn it ! - Hey ! Taggart ! God damn it ! Stop the kid ! Stop the kid ! Stop the kid ! Whoa , whoa . Where you going , son ? - I got you ! - Get the disc , get the disc ! Hurry up ! Go , go ! Shit ! Go , go , go ! You know , they 're getting quite devious , our Synthetics ... taking the form of human children . Yeah . Next time we gotta be on the lookout for nuns and orphans . So , have you figured out what our friend Chandra left us yet ? Well , best I can figure , it 's a programme ... that goes out and fingers the Internet worldwide looking for trace Al code ... rewrites itself along the way , covering its tracks . - What the hell are you talking about ? - Oh , sorry . It 's like a police scanner for the Internet . It picks up trace Sentient chatter and records it . So what are you saying ? We can listen in ... on the sons of bitches without them knowing it ? - Yeah . Sort of . - Well , that could sort of be useful . - They look busy today . - All day , every day . Well , it 's not necessarily Sentients talking to other Sentients . It could be a Sentient communicating with its Synthetic . The code would be similar . I 've been checking the whole Internet . Let me just try this keyword function . Whoa . Look at that . Number one on the Sentient hit parade today is Lawndale . There 's a suburb up by Galveston called Lawndale . Lawndale . There was a story about a murder there this morning . - God , why didn 't I think about it ? - Think about what ? I mean , a murder story 's a murder story , but this one caught my attention ... - and I couldn 't figure out why . - And now you can ? Yeah . Because after that murder , there were more murders ... and then all hell broke loose ... because that eventually turned into the Lawndale riot , remember ? Three people killed , 30 injured ... and a couple of million dollars of property damage . All right . So if the Sentients are talking about Lawndale ... Then they 're hooked into this riot somehow . But how ? Or more importantly , why ? So , what do you think , Sarah ? The murders caused this riot ? No . They just preceded it . But the authorities claim ... that the riots were due to post-traumatic stress disorder ... induced by fears of terrorism and economic insecurity . So , in other words , they didn 't have a fucking clue what caused it . Not a one . Great . Thought that was you . How was your day ? - Kind of sucked , actually . - What happened ? - Usual bullshit . - Got my unemployment cheque . How about I take you out for dinner ? Love to , but not with the kitchen like this . Does everything have to be such a big deal ? Just ' cause I 'm home doesn 't mean I 'm the maid . Good for you , Steve . I just did a 10-hour day and made some money . We can 't go to restaurants with you out of work . Like a $ 3 hamburger is gonna make a difference . Damn ! Can you fix this thing ? Everything around here is falling apart . Nothing makes you happy , does it ? Nothing in this shitty life together , you 're right . - Oh , why don 't you just leave ? - Maybe I will . You 've never been a partner to me . You 've never given me any kind of support . You just bitch and bitch and bitch . - Go on . Get your ass out of here . Go . - Get away from me , Steve . - You got that ugly look on your face . - Shut up . You miserable , frustrated , uptight , self-absorbed , full of yourself ... Prick . - Hey , Sarah , did you see this ? - What is it ? Another murder in Lawndale . - What ? - Mother of three , stabs her husband . I mean , what are they putting in the water up there anyway ? I don 't know , but it 's certainly worth a trip to find out . Ordinarily , I 'd agree , but my board 's full , every crew 's committed . I know . I thought of that . That 's exactly why I brought my own cameraman , Neil Taggart . - Hey . Nice to meet you . - Nice to meet you . - Nice to meet you . - Yeah . You , too . I 've seen you on the show . - You 're really great . - Thanks . - He 's got a great eye , he 's fast . - I don 't know . He 's non-union . Maybe I could send Frank Melnick with him to report it . The stringer ? No way . This is a major story . I 'm going . I can 't let you do that . We 're still ironing out the kinks in the two-anchor format . Troy , what kinks ? I think Sarah and I are working out just fine together . - Yeah , yeah , we are . - I did remotes like this all the time in Austin . Always gives a little boost to the ratings . - Does this mean that much to you ? - Yes . Okay . Get me four minutes for the evening programme . Kayli , you 'll be flying solo . Let 's get your copy rewritten . - Nice to meet you . - Yeah . You , too . - See you again . - Hope so . You got a little drool here . - Hi . - Hello . You must be Mr and Mrs Mendel . - Call me Angela , please . This is my ... - Kurt . - I 'm Kathleen Ashbury . - How do you do ? Nice to meet you . Kathleen . - Oh , Mr Seligson , good morning . - Nothing good about it . When the hell are you gonna do something with this dump ? It 's an eyesore . Matter of fact , I have my boys coming over today to do some yard work . About time . Nice to meet you . I don 't know what 's gotten into that man lately . But don 't worry , he 's not usually like that . - This way . - After you . I have to tell you , we don 't get many renters in Lawndale . - Can 't imagine why . - As a matter of fact ... this is the only house available for miles around . I only know about it because this area is my speciality . Well , I 'm sure there 's a really interesting reason why this one 's on the market . I hear the occupants murdered each other ... There was a divorce . A nice couple , never any problem , they were hoping to have children ... then suddenly they were having problems . He came home one day and she cleared out . - I mean , cleared out . - Oh , that 's so sad . I can 't imagine that happening to us , can you , darling ? No . No , I can 't , honey . What is it you do , Mr Mendel ? - He 's an accountant . - I 'm a novelist , actually . My wife 's little joke . Novelist-accountant . - Do you get it ? I do books . - Yeah . - She 's got a great sense of humour . - You 're funny . Well , let 's take a look around . Where shall we start ? Let 's start with the master bedroom because that 's where we spend most of our time . - Isn 't that right , darling ? - Yeah . All right . This way . Okay , the hammer murder took place here . Last night 's stabbing was over here . Now what else can you tell us about this riot ? I can tell you how it started . About 24 hours from now ... a man looking for a gas station hits a car that was backing up out of a driveway . Asshole ! - Look what you fucking did . - I 'm sorry . It was an accident . One of the residents , Bruce Seligson ... clobbers this guy over the head with a shovel . I interviewed Seligson in prison in the previous timeline . Anyway , this angry mob beats this poor guy to death , three people are killed ... and the only one ever convicted of anything is Seligson . So the two murders that are gonna happen ... actually happened in the original timeline ? So there 's gotta be a connection somehow between the perpetrators . Well , that 's what I 'm trying to find out ... but the woman who did the knifing is in isolation ... so there 's no way that I can get to her . I 'm just hoping that maybe , somehow , some way ... they 're gonna let me in to see the Hammer Slammer . I can 't believe I just said that . Well , your cameralsound guy is ready . Yeah , but there 's no way they 're letting a camera in ... without 10 forms of triplicate , five lawyers ... and one judge okaying everything . I gotta go in alone . Okay . Just do it . So , what are we doing in the meantime ? You and me , honcho , are gonna go take a look at this old man , Seligson ... whatever the hell his name is , and try to stop a riot from happening . Fun . And maybe figure out what all this has to do with the end of the world . - I 'm not what you 'd call a moody person . - What do you mean by that ? Well , they said I snapped . But I 'm usually a really level-headed guy . Well , then , forgive my forwardness , but why did you kill your wife ? I love my wife , Ms Forbes . More than anything in this world . I don 't know what happened . I don 't mean to be evasive . I just honestly don 't know . It was like ... I just had this rage . For , like , a month before I did it . For no good reason . Was there anything , anything at all that you can think of ... that might have provoked you ? The strange thing is ... as soon as they locked me up in this place ... all the anger went away . It just went away . - What the hell did you just order ? - Iced hazelnut mocha . - Iced hazelnut mocha ? - Yeah . Jesus . Sometimes I think the world ain 't worth saving . - What can I get for you today ? - I want a coffee , black , large . - Grande ? - Grande . Habla espanol ? No . Parla italiano ? I 'm afraid not , no . Then I want my coffee large , not a fucking grande . See ? - A large black coffee coming up . - Fucking pretentious , commercial bullshit . You can 't even order a coffee anymore ... without somebody trying to be the queen of France . Yeah . Careful . He didn 't brain her with any gardening tools . You sure that 's the right guy ? - Maybe . - Damn it , I said a latte , not cappuccino . - Here we go . - You always order a cappuccino . - Well , today I didn 't ! - Whoa . Easy , man . Hey ! Get the fuck out of here before I call the cops ! Go ahead . Let 's go . Well , it 's been nice talking to you and you 've been very helpful . Are you sure you don 't need a couple of sleeping bags ? An air mattress ? Oh , no . Our furniture 's on the way . Besides , we have each other , don 't we , darling ? Uh-huh . So , now ... that 's my home phone . Call if you need anything . - Perfect . - Fine . - Thank you . Bye . - Or just come over . Wow . Yeah . - Thank you . Bye . - Bye . See you later . Thank God . For one horrible moment , I saw myself at a Tupperware party . Well , did you at least learn anything about the new neighbours ? Are you kidding ? More than one human being would want to know . I know who 's fighting with whom , who 's getting a divorce ... and what children are monsters . What about you ? Everywhere you look , someone 's in open conflict . This whole bloody neighbourhood 's a powder keg . - All I need is a match . - Oh , by the way , darling , what 's for dinner ? - Up yours . - We had that last night . So how long have you worked with Sarah ? A couple of years . Why ? Has she always been so , you know , in and out ? What do you mean ? Well , I 've only been here a couple of weeks ... but it seems like she 's always rushing off somewhere . I mean , she says she 's following stories ... but I haven 't seen many of them on the air . Yeah . There 's something going on with her . It 's really only been the last six months or so . She and her husband are having problems ... and there 's a custody situation going on . Okay . - Yeah , that could explain a lot . - Yeah . Or maybe there 's something more going on . I don 't know . But , yeah , Sarah isn 't here a lot . Now , what about Troy , does he keep track of all these comings and goings ? Yeah . Troy 's got his head so far up her ass ... he can 't keep track of his own dick . What ? Forget that I said that . Okay . - After you , darling . - Thank you , darling . So , Chuck says he , Neil , and Sarah ... are experiencing this random aggression all over town . Where are we meeting them ? - Did you hear that ? - I sure did . Leave me alone ! Hey , hey ! That 's enough ! That 's enough ! That 's enough ! She 's trying to kill me ! Ungrateful little bitch ! Call 911 ! Now ! You all right ? Kurt ? You 'll be fine . You got a nasty bump . I 'll need to see you again tomorrow to make sure there are no after-effects . Just try and take it easy for a day or so . Easier said than done , but thank you , Doctor . Hey , that 's a good look on you . Oh , try not to overwhelm me with your empathy and compassion . Thank you . - Hello , darling . - We won 't , if you won 't . - Thanks , honey . - Before you go ... I 'll need to know what happened . Well , this daughter was beating up her mother ... and we tried to stop it and he got caught in the middle . Domestic altercation . I 'm beginning to think I should have a rubber stamp of that made . Have there been a lot of these injuries lately ? In the past six weeks , it 's about all I 've seen . Any injuries angry people can inflict on each other with the tools at hand . Blunt instrument trauma , lacerations , punctures ... Doctor , we have three patients screaming for treatment . In case you forgot . Everyone 's on edge . Even our staff . Thank you . Bye . - The whole town 's gone schizo . - Yeah . A blinding glimpse of the obvious . I try . Let me get this straight . You interviewed the Hammer Slammer ... - Hovic . - You interviewed Hovic ... but you don 't have any footage for the 5 : 00 ? The camera broke down . I 'll get it tomorrow . Don 't bother . Channel 8 's got him on their 11 : 00 . - He 'll be old news tomorrow . - Listen , I gotta go . I 'm gonna call you tomorrow . Bye . - Are you okay ? - I 'm fine . Thanks for asking . - Have any leads ? - No . Nothing . We 're just jerking ourselves around ... unless we can figure what 's cooking these people off . Well , if it 's affecting dozens or hundreds of people ... it can 't be Synthetics going door-to-door like Jehovah 's Witnesses , that 's for sure . Maybe it 's coming through the mail , like anthrax . No . If it were , the police and the CDC would be all over this place . Maybe it 's some kind of computer hypnotism ... like the Sentients did with those kids in Deer Park . Yeah , but there were no computers in that house ... where that woman 's daughter tried to kill her . Well , you know , it could be anything . It could be food , it could be water . Or power lines . Now that you mention it , they do sound kind of loud . - Well , it 's worth looking into , I guess . - Let 's go . Got a three-minute hole to fill in the A block . What do you mean ? What fell out ? Sarah 's package from Lawndale . I 'm sorry to say it , but I was half-expecting this . So , I wrote up some copy that I cobbled together from wire reports ... and from a phone interview ... that I did with the sister of the steak-knife slasher . Really ? - This is good . - It gets better . I got her to e-mail me a wedding picture of her sister , the slasher ... and the soon-to-be-slashed husband . We could use that for graphics . - This is good , kid . - Thanks . - Kathleen Ashbury rented the Draper place . - Yeah , I met them . Some mystery couple . He 's foreign . Hey , you know anything about that couple renting the Draper house ? Just that they 've got no furniture . All they 've got in there is some kind of electronics gear . - I don 't like the sound of that . - Oh , you know what else ? They put themselves in the middle of that catfight ... between Bitty Welsh and her daughter . I heard two people attacked Bitty Welsh . Neil , catch . Hey , nice toss . Please , could we please be discrete ? - Willie Mays you ain 't . - Yeah . - Hey , the control room 's over here . - Yes . - Good job , Sherlock . - Shut up , Watson . Sorry . Don 't touch anything . The power levels look high . Does the city of Lawndale actually need this much power ? Who the hell knows ? Maybe they 're anticipating a heavy usage this time of year ... or maybe one of the other stations on the grid is down for repairs ... and this one 's taking up the slack . Who the hell knows ? A Synthetic could have penetrated the utility system ... and bumped up the gain for its own reasons . Okay , guys . What exactly are we doing here ? Well , we 're looking for something , but I 'm beginning to think ... - it ain 't here , whatever it is . - Great . Then we 're wasting our time . - Oh , will you stop complaining ? - We 've hit dead end after dead end . - Excuse me if I 'm not jumping up and down . - Perish the thought . Boys , you 're both pretty . Yeah , we 're beginning to act like the locals , for Christ 's sake . You know , whatever is affecting them is affecting us , too . You 're damn right . It 's affecting our thoughts , our feelings , our emotions . Kurtrude ... it might be having a physical effect , too . Ain 't it about time for that follow-up exam with that doctor ... regarding your massive head wound ? - No , not until tomorrow . - Really ? - I thought you were having headaches . - No . How about now ? Still no sign of concussion . You 're probably experiencing ... some localised pain from the initial trauma . It seemed like rather fresh trauma , actually . Have you noticed any physical side effects to any of these cases ? You mean something that might point to a common cause ? No . Nothing . That was the first thing I looked for . Let 's go outside . Did they all eat the same food , live in the same area ? No . They 're all over the map . All racial types ... ages , every different kind of diet imaginable . Except , I 've been doing some follow-up on the patients ... and I did note one weird little after-effect . As soon as I put a patient on an IV , he or she calmed down ... - and stayed calmed down . - Well , what was in the IV ? Saline . In case you hadn 't noticed , it 's hot and humid . Right . Thank you , Doctor . Thanks very much . Take care . Bye . Is the saline somehow counteracting whatever 's making people violent ? I don 't know . Or is it because the patients ... are on a saline IV that they 're not getting something else ? - So , this is just ordinary tap water ? - Yeah . I took it from the local hospital . That 's hard to believe . That compound doesn 't belong in tap water . It 's a slight anomaly . It 's a fluoride cousin , hexafluoride . Some communities have big fluoride additives ... but I 've never seen this exact mixture before . Not exactly a Page 1 story . " Fluoride in water supply . Film at 11 : 00 . " No , it 's not . This is kind of a tame sample for you . What 's the deal ? Just tell me what hexafluoride does . I don 't know . Maybe it makes your teeth white . Whiter . Whitest . White teeth . Good God . Call 911 . So , if it 's not the water itself ... maybe it 's water in combination with another factor . Maybe we should try and mix it with something else . - Maybe you should try and heat it up . - Dude , it 's water . You can only heat it so much before it turns into steam . Right , right . So how about electricity , electric current ? - Let 's try it . - Fine . Yo , hit the light . Whoa . Now that 's not normal . No , it 's not . Maybe electricity is acting as a catalyst to the hexafluoride . There is some strange shit going on here . Possibly some weird kind of enzyme . Enzyme ? So what would this enzyme do ... if ingested by a human being for several days ? I have no idea . It could be anything . If you told me this makes people sprout feathers and fly ... - I couldn 't even rule that out . - Well , that 's helpful . Looks like this whole place is automated . It 's pretty cool . Angela , we 're in . Let us know if you see anything . What are we looking for here ? The power lines are revved up . Somewhere in this water distribution plant someone 's adding a protein which ... combined to electricity , is creating a nasty enzyme ... which makes people even nastier . Well , like you said , the whole damn thing is automated ... so there 's gotta be a terminal around here somewhere . Okay , hold it . You folks better have a good reason for being down here . I 'm Sarah Forbes from KNBS News . This is my cameraman , Neil . This is my scientific and engineering consultant ... - Commander Taggart and Dr Mendel . - Commander Taggart . We heard about some strange goings-on here in Lawndale ... and we were just wondering if it had something to do with the water supply . Or some sort of contamination . I know we kind of overstepped boundaries by breaking in like this ... but you know , the city takes a while to respond to requests , so ... - Taggart . You 're the astronaut . - Guilty as charged . Let me rephrase that . - Contamination , you say ? - Yeah , that 's right . Maybe you can help us ? I mean , it 's obvious you work here , right ? Yeah . I 'm the back-up system , in case the automated system breaks down . So , you 'd know if there was anything out of the ordinary ... anything unusual going on , right ? Look , we need your help , see ? This is a ... This is a public water system . It 's contaminated . We need some help here . I 've been working at this plant for the last 10 years . The last two or three months I 've been getting lost . It 's just like the pipes are moving when I 'm not even looking . Walls will open up when they weren 't there the day before . That the kind of thing you 're looking for ? Yeah . That 's exactly what we 're talking about . Can you take us to it ? This way . Sounds like LDU-7 all over again . Yeah , we never did find our Synthetic . We didn 't find it ' cause the whole damn building was one . It disappeared . What if our friend there is a Synthetic as well ... and he 's leading us to the slaughter . - We go down fighting . - Speak for yourself . - This is crazy . We 're breaking and entering . - The hell we are . We 've got a key and permission from the landlady . Besides , this could be an emergency . Nothing . Nobody 's living here . - We were right . - Well , look at this . Computer stuff , communications gear . - What 's it for ? - We 've got lots of high-tech facilities ... up the road . If you were a terrorist , wouldn 't you be interested ? Terrorists ? Didn 't Kathleen Ashbury check them out ? Ashbury . She 'd have Saddam Hussein over for cookies and milk ... if she thought she could sell him a house . - We have to call the police . - Those idiots ? Get the Texas Rangers . - No , this is a job for the FBI . - Texas Rangers . I 'm telling you , the FBI . Over here is where the water comes from the San Jacinto Water District . This is where the water comes to the various water towers ... redistribution plants , all of that . I show up for work two weeks ago ... and I swear that pipe wasn 't there the day before . Now , nothing happens around here without me knowing about it . - So impossible , right ? - Maybe not . - See that pipe over there ? - Yeah . I don 't recognise it . Now in July , I like to take my family to the hill country for a couple of weeks . Maybe someone else oversaw the installation while I was gone ... but there 's no paperwork . Nobody I spoke to knows anything about this ... and I can 't get in there , and every time I look at them they look different . Is there a computer station around here ? In for a penny , in for a pound . Over here . Up there ? We gotta figure out which one of these pipes ... is dumping the mean pills into the water system . Yeah . Give me about a week . We 've gotta find a way to stop these enzymes from getting in . - Why don 't we just stop them going out ? - No . I don 't see Ed letting us shut off the water to his whole bloody town . Well , who the hell says he has to know ? Can you shut down the whole damn water delivery system ? I could try . Yeah , but can you stop Ed from fixing it once we 're gone ? I got a nasty little virus I keep in a deleted file on my e-mail programme . I download that , it should fuck things up good for a couple of hours . - Well , do it . And let 's go stop a riot . - Yeah . Oh , Christ . Shouldn 't we have some equipment or something ? Yeah . It 's too bad I left my riot gear in the Mustang . A squad of Marines is more like it . We 're not going out there with these bloody lunatics , are we ? Hell , yes . Unless you got a better way to stop a riot from in here . Neil , give me the camera . Now is the time to have your granddad 's handgun . You 're right . It is . - Hey ! That 's them ! - Hey ! - Who the fuck are you people ? - Why is that shit in the house ? - I don 't know why that shit 's in the house . - Who the fuck are you ? - I 'm Sarah Forbes with the KNBS . - Oh , yeah ? - And who the hell are you , Peter Jennings ? - No . I 'm better looking . Hey , hey ! - Calm down . - Watch it . Who the hell are you people ? Hey , get out ! There 's the car ! Asshole ! - Look what you fucking did . - I 'm sorry . It was an accident . - Hang on , hang on . - You 're not on the goddamn freeway . - I 'm sorry . I didn 't see you . - Hang on . He didn 't mean nothing . Listen , he didn 't mean anything by this , so just back off a second . Are you all right ? - Oh , shit . - Get off of him ! Get away ! Kill him ! Fire . The house is on fire . My house . My house ! Do something ! Hose it ! All right , all right ! I 'm getting a hose out here ! At 23 Maple Court . - I thought you turned off the water . - There 's still some left in the pipes . Hope there 's enough to put it out . It 's a great cigar , you know . Excuse me . Kayli , change in plans . - You 're not doing the lead-in tonight . - Then who the hell will ? We got a hot roll from Lawndale . Everybody , we are leading with the feed from Lawndale , all right ? - When are we on ? - We 're on now . - Okay , let 's go . - And in five , four , three ... Good evening , Houston . This is KNBS News at 5 : 00 . I 'm Sarah Forbes reporting to you live ... from the ordinarily quiet community of Lawndale ... where just a half-hour ago this suburban neighbourhood exploded ... into a mystifying violence that came extremely close ... to being fatal . Well , it 's obvious that that Sentient behind what happened in Lawndale ... is obviously the same one that constructed LDU-7 . So , this was just an outgrowth of its studies in human aggression ... - it was conducting in the prison ? - And a damn successful one , too ... I 'm sorry to say , in spite of the fact we stopped a riot from going berserk . Well , credit where credit is due . Setting the house on fire ... was a stroke of genius . Whatever inspired you to do this ? You did . And you and you and all of us . Other than the common denominator of all of us stuck in a space ship ... five years from now when the world blew to shit ... you think we 'd be sitting here together in this dump ? - Oh . - Oh , what ? - Finally , you refer to this place as a dump . - Figure of speech . It 's a figure of speech . Oh , yeah , that 's right . You actually like that crappy chilli . Yes . And a particular waitress , perhaps . Hey , hey , hey . Mind your own damn business , snotnose , and you two dorks underscore my point . I mean , you think we 'd be sitting here grunting at each other ... much less breaking bread , if we didn 't have a common goal ? Not only no , but hell , no . I just did something to keep those people 's minds off themselves ... bring them all together , so to speak . At least until the cops came . So the enzyme that the Sentient was testing on Lawndale ... - it actually increased rage ? - Looks that way . Can you imagine if he used it on a larger population ? It wouldn 't just be neighbour against neighbour . It 'd be country against country . Yeah . Countries with weapons of mass destruction . In a simple , elegant way of eliminating millions of unwanted human beings . You know what ? Suddenly I 'm not so hungry anymore . Too bad this isn 't closed caption . He 's singing that the soul shall not be shattered by any weapon ... nor burned by fire , nor moistened by water ... nor withered by the wind . Second book of the Bhagavad-Gita . Check it out , it 's pretty cool . Naran Chandra worked not far from here ... at the university . He would often come here when he was working out a problem ... or just when he needed some calm , some quiet . He asked that some of his ashes be scattered here in this place ... where he knew some peace , however briefly . Have you noticed something that 's rather sad ? We 're more than half the entire funeral party . - Yeah . Except for those over there . - Where ? 11 : 00 , by the tree . $ 5 says they turn up green on Kurt 's thermal imager . Yeah . Checking to see if they really killed him . If they can get to Chandra , they can get to any of us . Well ... as a wise man I knew ... I believe he was from Texas , once said , " Don 't take it too seriously . " Nobody gets out of life alive . "

 Futurama [ 5x03 ] - The Route Of All Evil - CiWaN Ah , beer . So many choices . And it makes so little difference . How about Lobrau ? It has dots on it . Overruled ! The choice of champions is Pabst Blue Robot . I can 't drink that . The metal shavings make my throat bloody . Baby wants a Zima . Hey , hey . We can all fight when we 're drunk . Listen , why don 't we just brew our own beer ? You can brew your own beer ? Sure . The kids at the orphanarium used to do it all the time . Cursed bacteria of Liberia ! My own son , suspended from boarding school . It 's not my fault , Dad . And you , Cubert . I cloned you from one of my warts , and I can send you straight back there . What 's going on ? Is this angry yelling , or busted-Hearing-Aid yelling ? I 'm afraid it 's both . What ? Now , hold on . Everyone cool your daiquiris . Let 's give the little vermin a chance to explain themselves . It was self-Defense , Mom . Just look at this letter the principal sent . We were in science class ... And we had finished building a miniature black hole . That was easy . Pretty scrawny black hole . It must be hungry . Black holes don 't need food . Neither do nerds . My Manwich ! That 's it . You 've compressed our lunches to a singularity ... For the last time . Salt him , Dwight . When I re-Solidify , I 'm gonna put you in a world of goop . See ? That bully started it . We couldn 't fight back with brawn ... So we used our brains . I warned you not to use those things ! Let 's see . We 've got our malt . Our hops . We just need a big disposable tub to mix it in . Now it needs to boil for a couple hours . Dwight , you remember the crew ? Yeah . Crew , you remember Cubert ? Yeah . Wonderful ! Then I 'm sure you won 't mind ... Being their legal guardians for a month . Well , well , if it isn 't my old friends , Stretch Pants , No Pants ... And Idiot . We 're making beer . I 'm the brewery . I heard alcohol makes you stupid . No , I 'm ... Doesn 't . Actually , Dwight , you 're right . Alcohol is very , very bad . For children . But once you turn 21 ... It becomes very , very good . So scram . Oh , man . I 'm sick of this . Hey , Dad . What useless contraption are you half-Baking today ? You what ? Oh , this is my latest invention . A device that lets anyone sound exactly like me . Good news , everyone . I 'm a horse 's butt . I am ? That 's not good news at all , you little ... What 's this device 's marketability ? Who 's the target consumer ? There is no target consumer . Only targets . Targets that will tremble in fear as their new masters hand down edicts In my glorious , booming voice ! Now quit pestering me , you confounded scoundrels ! Can I collate that ? No . Can I shred these contracts ? No ! Wow ! A power stamper . Now look at all the work I gotta do ! The ingredients are cooked . They picked up some of your natural robot flavorings . Time to add the yeast . Yeast ? You mean I 'll have a life form growing inside me ? It 's so beautiful . Talk to me . This is Professor Farnsworth . I have an important delivery for you and your dumb crew . You must deliver a pizza to Dog Doo 8 ... A planet at the edge of the universe . Sorry I can 't come to say goodbye , but I 'm busy inventing useless junk . And I smell bad . If you were my kids , you 'd get quite a talking to . From your father . When he got home from the Senate . Oh , bother . What have they done now ? Those pork dumplings sent us on a fake pizza delivery . The address was on Dog Doo 8 . But the universe ends right after Dog Doo 7 . Child-Man , is this true ? Yeah . But why are you mad at us ? Your dummy brigade wasted a week on an obviously fake mission . Plus , they 're making bootleg beer inside company property . Lies ! Lies and slander ! Accusing gentle Bender of a misdeed ? That 's the last straw ! You boys have been underfoot long enough . You jerked the words right out of my mouth . We 're their fathers , and it 's high times we acted like it . Here comes violence . Get a job , you lazy kids . I guess if you want children beaten , you have to do it yourself . Come on , Dad . Shuffle faster ! You don 't wanna miss the unveiling of our company . Company ? Cute . What 'll you peddle ? Lemonade ? Shoeshines ? Cootie insurance ? Perhaps they 've constructed a teddy bear hospital . Actually , we 're starting a competing delivery company . Welcome to the world of business . Who 's going to use a delivery service with a kicked sign ? Nobody , that 's who . We already have a client signed up . We 're delivering the Daily Supernova . So your delivery company is just a cute , harmless paper route . No . It 's a serious business . Yes . It 's a tremendous responsibility , all right . What if a paper were to land in a puddle ? Civilization as we know it might get splashed . Why do they always treat us like dumb kids ? We 're practically old enough to find the Fox Network infantile . We 'll show them . All Awesome Express needs ... Is a sturdy interstellar delivery craft . Voil ? ! You got a quarter ? Man ! The ad said to allow four to six seconds for delivery . More like seven . I 'm really starting to swell up with beer . I must look ridiculous . No . You have a healthy glow . Oh , my God ! I just felt it ferment . Let me feel . Have you thought about a name ? I was thinking Benderbrau if it 's an ale ... Botwiser if it 's a lager . I hope it 's a lager . I can take it to a ball game . I felt that one ! There 's a crack in the hull here . That could cause explosive decompression . Put a sticker on it . Off on your first delivery ? You be careful , my little tinkler . Remember we used to call you that , huh ? Tinkler . Gets moving . Those newspapers won 't deliver themselves . Only the Sunday edition can do 's that . Goodness , there must be 50 papers in that bundle . That 's a big number , 50 . Yeah . If you 're an idiot . Three , two , one . All systems go . Blastoff ! See you at din-Din . I 'm blowing you a kiss . Take evasive action ! It 's closing in . You can 't avoid it . It 's a cheek-Seeker . And ... Got you ! No ! Business is down , so I filed papers to have you all reclassified as slaves . Well , well , if it isn 't our little munchkin moguls . What 's the trouble , men ? Need some penny rolls for your profits ? Actually , thanks to Dwight 's brilliant accounting ... And my unaccountable brilliance ... Our paper route now has over a million customers ! We 're finally making more money than you guys . Aren 't you impressed now , Pops ? Aren 't you ? Aren 't you ? In a small way , yes . You still don 't have your own building or conference table ... Or one of those things . Hello . Our dads are never impressed , no matter what we do . Maybe we should start a fire . If we really want to impress them , we 'll have to crush them with strategy . Dwight Lightning . Very well . But I get to name the next strategy . This week on The Real World The Sun : I 'm burning to death ! You know how much an apartment that big would cost on the sun ? People ! As you know , our young sons have become great successes ... In the very same field as us . Oh , that 's great ! That 's good . Naturally , we 're humiliated . That 's why we need you , our loyal crew ... To make Planet Express 800 % more profitable . We 'll start by slashing salaries . And this time , I mean really slashing . Guys ? I don 't know how to tell you this ... So I 'll just let Fry blurt it out thoughtlessly . We don 't work for you anymore ! What ? Dwight and Cubert made us an offer . We 're paperboys now . Incoming ! We 've got papers to stuff , team . Hut-Two . Hut-Two . Yes , sir . We 're on it , Mr. Farnsworth . Folks ? The situation is grim . But we shall prevail , thanks to you , our crack team of loyal dregs . I don 't even know who this guy is . I 'm Scruffy , the janitor . Of course you are . Now , we 've got to buckle down ... And save Planet Express . I 'm on break . Sorry to interrupt this whirlwind of activity , but we have an announcement . I direct your attention to the forms which I 'm presently engaged in handing you . Sweet guinea pig of Winnipeg ! They 've taken over our company . Balderdash ! I never agreed to that . No . But you did declare yourself dead three years ago as a tax dodge . Tax dodge , nothing ! You take one nap in a ditch at the park ... And they start declaring you this and that . Either way , I technically inherit your building and your spaceship . Which means Planet Express is now ... Awesome Express . You rotten kids ! Will you be hiring ? No . You rotten kids ! There . One million papers , folded and loaded . Leela , help me apply these flame decals I got in my cereal . They 'll make the ship go faster . And what 's your scientific basis for thinking that ? I 'm 12 . Did I ever tell you how I used to own that ship ? There but for the grace of God . Oh , my God ! I think it 's time ! Hurry , Leela ! Get some coasters and cold mugs . Push , Bender ! Push ! You 're doing great . Oh , it feels like it 's trying to push a waterbed out of me . Almost there . Just two more bottles . Is it okay ? I can 't hear anything . It 's an ale . Five gallons , six ounces . Hey , what 's going on ? This is a delivery company , not a delivery room . We busted our buns delivering a million papers ... And this is how you greet us ? With a bunch of frosty cold beers ? Hey , wait a second . How did you deliver a million papers in one hour ? We just did , okay ? 'Cause we 're awesome . Yeah . Awesome . Yeah . Awesome . Hello , Awesome Express , the rude , crude delivery dudes . How may I direct your call ? What 's that ? You haven 't gotten your paper ? In how long ? Might a homeless old man have a touch more beef bourguignon ... And another tequila slammer ? Please ? Don 't you sweet-Talk me ... You wrinkly old tube sock . May I have one too , wife ? You 're both pathetic , being jealous of your own offspring . Now , you should be happy that they became successes ... Instead of following in your food stamps . Oh , it 's true . But they grow up so fast . We wanted a few more years of being better than them . They 're so stinking talented , they don 't even need their fathers anymore . Dad ! We screwed up . You did ? Tough luck , suckers . Help us , Pops . We agreed to deliver way more papers than we could handle . We couldn 't handle them . We dumped the extras in a crater on the moon . Now everybody 's yelling at us about their missing papers . And we don 't know what to do ! Why did you boys do all this ? We wanted you to be proud of us . Proud of you ? You ruined us with sleazy business practices ... And a complete disregard for human decency . Of course we 're proud of you . Damn right , we are ! Now , come on , let 's go do a little father-Son weaseling out of this . Good thing I had this net installed for catching giraffes . Okay , boys . Let me show you how a paper man does it . Au revoir ! Can I use the gun , Dad ? What kind of father would I be if I said no ? Only one house to go . We did it ! Run away ! That bully , Brett Blob , lives there . He 's ugly , mean , stupid , stink mucus ! And last week , we sort of broke his window . All right , all right . What do we do when we break somebody 's window ? Pay for it ? Oh , heavens , no ! We apologize with nice , cheap words . I thought I heard the doorbell . But I see it was the " dork bell . " You made a funny good one , Brett . Now , now , no need to give us the business . We 'd like a word with your daddy . Whatever . Dad ! Don 't worry , boys . I 'm sure his father is a perfectly normal , reasonable man . What do you want ? Mr. Blob , our sons have come to apologize for damaging your window . They 've learned their lesson , and they want to make amends . Sorry , sir . Yeah , sorry . You shove your apology into the bottom of your one-Way digestive system . Now , see here . We assured our sons that you 'd accept their apology . Tell you what . I 'll accept their apology when they kiss my ass ! Which I don 't have . No one gives my boy that option . Bring it on , Jell-O pop . Yeah , get him , Dad . Show him who 's boss . Get him , Pops . Right . That was incredible ! You are the bravest dads in the entire trauma center . You guys almost had him , until he digested you . Oh , you 're good kids . If I could feel anything right now , it would be pride . I was wrong ! I can still feel pain ! He 's come to finish the job . Someone toss me out the window ! No , no wait . I feel terrible about what happened . I 've just been under a lot of stress lately down at the plant , you know ? They 're bringing in computers to improve productivity ... And , well , that 's no excuse for how I acted . But the boy needs to see that real men solve their disagreements with words ... Not violence . So if you 'll accept my apology ... Well , I hope we can put this embarrassing incident behind us . I suppose . Hey , chumps . I heard you were on the ass end of an ass-Kicking . I figured you could use a few of these . Why not ? Might as well live it up as long as I got this catheter in me . Won 't you join us , Mr. Blob ? Sounds like a plan . This is what makes life worth clinging to . Three fathers enjoying a day out with their sons . It would seem we 've taught our boys a lesson about life . Man or blob , it 's what 's inside that counts .

 It 's Jesse 's birthday today . she 's 10 years old today . Oh , boy , happy birthday , Jesse ! Don 't be so loud , Pop . Happy birthday , sweetheart . Thank you . Okay , now you 've got to make a wish . Okay ... - Okay . Good job . - Thanks . I point far but not to the nearest star . It 's too early for riddles , Pop . Wow ! A laser . Wow ... Wow , Pop , this is great . Thanks , Pop , I like it . - You 're welcome . Does this mean I 'm going to get a telescope too ? We 'll just have to wait and see . But you 've got to eat your breakfast . We 're running late . Thank you . - Hmm . Yeah . Our first family portrait . Ha ! All right . - Bye . Bye . No after-school program , so I 'll pick you up . I know . I love you , bye . Hey , Jesse . - Hey , Audrey . Just put it over there . On this day in history , June 7th ... Mahatma Gandhi initiated the campaign of civil ... Ah ! What are the odds of that ? Okay , why Professor Neumeyer is not dead ... someone wants to have a go at the physics ? Come on , people . Huh ... gravity , sir ? Terminal velocity ? The speed you were driving at . - The dog . Dog is random , dog is destiny . Dog is the reason Professor Neumeyer stands here instead of being skewered to his truck seat . D-O-G . Thank you , Mr. Axelrod . This is not a graduate class . Please , confine your comments to the appropriate venue . Make the most of him , kiddiewinks . He is the best physics professor you will ever have . All right , please open your books to Willard , page 16 , " Principles of Particles . " so ... I meant to work on reality sets all spring , but I got hijacked by this idea . No office hours today , Carl . Believe me , it 's okay . Here , I just need you to sign here and I need you to sign there ... - No , I 'm not your thesis advisor . Okay , Dr. Popovich ... - Popovich is a useless collection ... of subatomic ... this entire lobotomized faculty ... Carl , you 're not listening to me . I 'm not your thesis advisor . Do you know M.I.T. wanted me , Chicago , Cal Tech ... I chose this overpriced widget factory because of you ... stockholm ... your refutation of Witten 's string theory application ... you anticipated membranes ... - That was a long time ago . Yeah , but it is still in there and I want that . Carl , you can be extremely annoying . I can ? - Yes , do you know that ? Damn , Carl , social IQ ... I completely forgot what today is for you ... I mean ... death of your wife , birth of your daughter ... That 's enough , no , no , no , no , my personal life is off-limits , Carl . Right , okay , so when I research a subject , I research it , like this idea that I have been working on basically since March . Here , you forgot your jacket . When you get a look at my special project ... No , I 'm sure . - - trust me ... Dr. Popovich will love it . - it will blow your mind . I 'm sure he 'll love it , yeah . Denorvo Insurance . Claudia , it 's me . Are you busy ? You sound stressed . Everything okay ? Not really . Believe it or not , I 'm calling about an insurance issue and I am stressed . - What happened ? You won 't believe it . - No way ! It 's amazing , huh ? - Oh , my gosh . Uh-oh . Uh-oh ... - Come on . It 's stuck , it 's stuck , oh . I 'm glad it happened after you dropped me off at school . Yeah , me too . - Thanks . Did my mom like Pop-Tarts ? You know , I don 't think she ever ate a Pop-Tart . But would she like ' em ? Yeah , I think she would if she ever tried one , but only on weekends . Hey , look . What is that ? It looks kind of like a laptop . Don 't touch it . Hey , look , it 's got your name on it . Come on , pick it up . - What ? ! Come on . All right , listen . I want you to go stand back there . Okay , Dad . This is ... it 's locked . Maybe someone knew that you were going to be here to find it . Come on , Pop , birthday puzzle . We can figure it out , right ? It 's difficult to open a six-digit combination , see ? see there ? Not for you . We 've got to get going . We don 't want to keep the others waiting . Why not ? It 's just not a good idea to keep anyone waiting . Okay , you all set ? - All set . Oh , here they come . Quick , everyone hide ! Okay , everybody , take your places . Honey , just leave that . Just come here . Just hide . - Quick , quick , quick , quick . Jesse loves this . You mean you do this for her every year ? Yes , it 's our tradition . By the way , I invited Claudia to the party . You did ? Why ? Because . Hold on a minute ... Dad , I know it isn 't locked . Oh , no , I can 't find my house keys . Come on , let 's just get this over with . Surprise ! Happy birthday , sweetie . - Thank you . Thanks , Uncle Brad . Hey , how you doing ? Are you okay ? - sure . Happy birthday . - Thank you . Happy birthday , Jesse bear . Let me know if there 's anything I can get for you . Fine . Oh , my gosh ! Is that my favorite organic carrot cake ? Maybe . - Oh , boy . How are you ? You okay ? - Oh , yeah . Are you sure ? - Yeah . That 's an apartment complex . A whole apartment complex . An apartment complex ? - You guys have a soda ? Can I get you a soda , sweetie ? - sure , thank you . Would you guys like a soda ? - Do you have a root beer ? Yes I do . Uh , Claudia ... - Yeah ? maybe we should rethink these . Why ? - They 're toy guns . Oh , come on , it 's a birthday party , it 's supposed to be fun . Well , actually , it 's not just a birthday party . It 's also the anniversary ... - of Catherine , Jesse 's mom . Perhaps you didn 't know that . No , I know that . It 's always a tough day for JT . Right . Okay , well , why don 't we ask him ? Okay , JT ... Hey , you . - Oh , hey . That Claudia sure has some great ... energy . That 's what I was going to say . she has great energy . Yeah , she does . - so you 've got a new girlfriend . You 've got a new briefcase . Is this a new JT 's sighting ? What 's next ? - No , no , I didn 't buy this . somebody left this at Katherine 's grave . That 's somewhat bizarre . - Yeah . Who knew you were going to be there ? I mean , besides us . Nobody . Well , it 's not true actually , remember that grad student of mine ... Carl Axelrod ? I 'll get you ! - Get outta here . Okay. listen to me , listen to me . Document everything ... - Yeah . every conversation , every impression and get witness statements if you can get them . You 're watching too much Court TV . No , come on , you remember that math professor at Stanford ? You 've got to be careful about things these days . You really do . Headlines for today , June 7th , 1994 ... friends and family of O.J. SimpsonV are pleading with him to turn himself in . Dr. Davenport , to radiology ... I 'm so sorry , JT , we lost her . Come on , Pop , let 's go open up my presents . All right , I 'll be right there . - Okay . Oh my God ! Playstation 2 ... - Wow ! I want one of those . - Oh , my gosh , look . Yeah , big score , big score , baby . Jesse ? - Wow ! holy cow . It 's bigger than you are . - It 's like up to there on you . Jeez , it is . Wow ! - What could that be ? I don 't know . - Guess , guess ... flip it over . It 's a telescope ! - Wow ! she 's a beaut . Thank you . Thank you , Papa . - You 're welcome . Pop , let 's set up my telescope . I 've got to go out for just a little bit , Jess . I cannot find my house keys . They 're on the infinity ring . Where are you taking the case , Pop ? Here is what we 're gonna do , Jess , when I get back , we are going to set up the telescope together and we 're going to look at the star nursery in Orion . Promise ? - Promise . Hold you to it . Thanks for staying , Claudia . Hey ! Hey . What 's wrong ? - Nothing . should I be taking this personally or is it just the whole day ? No , no , it 's been ... you 've been great . No , I just ... I have to take care of this . And it can 't wait till morning ? I tell you what , I will tell you all about it tonight in bed . In bed here ? - Hmm-hm . Have you spoken to her ? No , but I think she 'll be okay about it . Well , I 'd like to know if she 'd be okay about it ... because if she is not , a couple of months of hot dating is all we 're ever going to be . I agree and I think we should play it safe . Listen , I don 't want to blow this either . We 'll just be careful . see you later , squirrel . - Bye , Pop . .. like this idea that I 've been working on basically since March . Here , you forgot your jacket . so when you get a look at my special project , trust me , it will blow your mind . Who is it ? Professor Neumeyer , we need to talk right now . Step back from the door . Your special project , Carl , we need to talk about it . Step back from the door . You crossed the line , Carl . Who is it ? All right , Carl . Why don 't I take this to Campus security and let them deal with you ? Step back from the door . Who is it ? Don 't you dare tell me it 's easy , okay ? Forget the picture . Just look at the shapes . Oh , here . Come here . Northwest Psychic Hotline . Hi , hey , it 's me . - Did you open the case ? Listen , I 'm gonna be a little longer . Will you tell Claudia ? I 'm stopping by Brad and Chantal 's , then I 'll be home . You promised to set up my telescope so I 'm going to wait for you school night and all . - Okay , deal . Dad 's gonna be late . - No biggie . Hey , wait a minute ... Ha ! Wow ! Jeez . You should have seen your face . Oh , you bastard . Hey , I want to show you this . You 've got to read this . What is it ? - A grad student 's summer project . stick 'em up ! This is incredible . Look at this bullet hole . Is there such a thing as grad school for Photoshop ? No , but it 's not flawless you know ... I don 't have a blue parka , I don 't own a green Jeep Cherokee . And there 's no way I would ever step foot into a redneck bar called " Buck Naked . " What are you gonna do ? Turn it over tomorrow to campus police . Campus police ? Nah-ah , you need the real thing . Come on , JT , this is really sick . This is what they call obsessive behavior . This guy is deranged . This goes way beyond stalking . You 've got to take this stuff downtown tonight and let the police deal with Carl . - There is no way to prove he did it . Well , is he smart enough ? Or crazy enough ? You know what he is ? He 's a religious fanatic whose religion happens to be quantum physics . Hey , wait a minute . Look at this ... I 'm on the suspects list and he 's got my social security number . My God , this could be ... Identity theft . If you 're not gonna call , I 'm gonna do it right now . Wait , hold on . I got a better idea . There 's a detective here , Detective Irwin Sikorski . Give me tape , lots of tape . Give me room to live and breathe . When you got here , what did you do ? - Nothing much ... checked for a pulse , but he was flat lined . Dialed you straight up , Detective . Let 's see what we have . Autopsy 's going to find that ... or what 's missing from that , stuck in his esophagus . Either asphyxiated , went cardiac or both . No foul play , no fun for me . I just want to know ... Tell Doughnut Dan to lay us out a few dozen murder weapons , before I eat that evidence , would you ? Yeah , you got it . - stand back . I live right here . - Excuse me . Unless you 're the new evidence man , get the hell out of my crime scene . Detective Sikorski , JT Neumeyer , I just need a moment of your time . I 'll give you a moment in my holding tank , Neumeyer . Now get the hell out of here . - It 's very important , please . You know , if that guy out there chewed like his mother taught him , he 'll be home watching the news by now . How did you find me ? I have a friend who works at a newspaper . They have a scanner , they knew you 'd be here , they knew you had a weakness for pastrami , so ... I got a lot of weaknesses , believe me . so ... you 're scheduled to die on Friday , huh ? I hope not , it 's inconvenient . Always is . Hand them out to those guys over there . You got anybody in mind for this ? It 's obviously somebody you know . You must have some idea . Well , there 's a graduate student named Carl Axelrod ... so that 's a start . Why don 't you ... tell this to campus police ? They live for this kind of crap . Doesn 't it bother you that your name 's on it ? Well , if it has to do with homicide , it better be . I 'm sorry , Professor , I don 't do hoaxes , especially ones full of holes . Holes ... what do you mean by that ? It says here . I didn 't attend the autopsy , right there ... " Tuesday , June 15th , 2.00 P M. , investigating officer not present . " You know the last time I missed an autopsy ? Nah . - Neither do I. Well , I don 't know you from a hole in the ground . But you don 't look the type to me that hangs out in a sleaze pit like " Buck Naked . " No . - It 's just a prank . some junior egghead is trying to screw with you a little . A little huh ? - Uh-uh . I see people get screwed with a lot . This is a little . It 's just paper . Why don 't you go home and just be thankful you didn 't die with a piece of doughnut clogged in your throat ? Thanks for the pastrami . Hey . - Oh , hey . When did you get back ? - About a half-hour ago . Did you get everything taken care of ? Yeah , for tonight anyway . I 'm sorry it took so long . You know what ? - Huh ? It was time well spent . she 's a good kid . We had fun . What do you say you run a bath and we have a little fun too ? Huh ? I 'll be right up . I 'm just gonna show Jesse the Orion Nebula . Those are baby stars , Jesse , made up from gases and space dust . You know the light we 're seeing tonight was emitted 1,500 years ago ? Wow ! You opened the case , didn 't you ? Entrez . Care to join me ? - Absolutely . Thank you . For what ? - For being here , being so good to Jesse , but most of all for being naked in this bathtub . Want to wash my back ? You , tease . - Absolutely . I 've got a present for you . I thought it would be perfect for you , so ... What did you do ? Do you like it ? What 's wrong ? But I just bought it , JT . How could Carl know right down to the color ? You know , I mean ... every second parka is blue . It 's a coincidence . It 's ... Look , you weren 't even at my funerals . You wouldn 't miss that , would you ? I mean , it 's ... Claudia , look , I 'm a physics teacher , I 'm a single dad . I do jigsaw puzzles , for God 's sake . Who 'd want to kill me ? I 'm too damn dull . Do you want to kill me ? - How ? Do you think Brad wants to kill me ? Why would Brad want to kill you ? He 's your brother-in-law . Yeah , well , but I 'm gonna show you something here . You 're both on the suspect list . - Wow , I 'm a suspect . Yeah , along with Carl who worships me for some reason , and there 's some guy I 've never heard of . Who ? Roy Bremmer . This is really unromantic . I think we need to ... just put this away . - Let 's take a rain check . No , I mean Claudia , you can still stay . Another time . Claudia , what 's wrong , I ... - Nothing 's wrong . I mean , I know this whole thing is kind of spooky but ... Nothing 's wrong . I just think it would be better if we did it another time , that 's all . so when did Claudia go home ? Huh , last night . I thought ... Hmm , never mind . Hey , Jess ... You know , now might be a good time to talk about Claudia and us . That 's okay , I think I 'm gonna go and get dressed , you know . Oh . Jess ... Please , tell me what 's in the case . 'Cause I know that you opened it . stuff for me . Well , I found it , so I think I have a right to look . No . It has my name on it and the stuff inside is clearly meant for me . so once I find out what it all means and if it 's appropriate I will show it to you . You know what that probably is ? It 's probably our loaner . sweet . Excuse me . - Wow ! Mr. Neumeyer ? - Yeah . sorry about our rush hour traffic . I 'm here to take your truck to the repair shop . Oh , here we are . I reckon she 's found the radio . Enjoy . Thanks , I 'm sure we will . All righty . You realize once the truck is fixed , we 're back to plebe status . It 's just fun having nice things . I mean , really nice things like Uncle Brad 's and Chantal 's nice . Oh , I see . - Love you . Love you , bye . - Bye , see you later . Hey , Claudia , Uh , listen ... I want to take a rain check for last night , but that 's not why I 'm calling ... I 've got a question about the rental car you arranged for us . Yeah , the thing is ... Wait , I better go here . Professor . You got that file on you ? so what made you change your mind ? Carl Axelrod , he 's the student , right ? The one you pegged for this ? Well , if he did it , he put himself on the suspect list . Is he really that crazy ? He 's ... until yesterday I thought he was just weird . He 's one of the brightest students I 've ever had ... socially inept , a little creepy , but that 's about it . I 'll check him for priors . see who else Carl has been messing with here . Professor Bradley Hume . - It 's my late wife 's brother . He 's a friend , colleague , good scientist , better stock picker , but ... no , he wouldn 't be a suspect , even if this thing was real . seven out of 10 murders are committed by friends or family of the vic . Wow . What about Claudia Whitney ? - Uh , my girlfriend . That doesn 't mean she wouldn 't want to kill you . Hell , my wife , she tries to wring my neck at least twice a day . Yeah . Well , imagine that . How long have you known her ? Huh , four months . We met over term life. she 's my insurance agent . What , your girlfriend handles your life insurance ? Did you name her executor or name her in your will ? No , that 's my ... my daughter is my sole beneficiary . This is interesting . - What ? It says that they found an unspent bullet on your body . That 's like a calling card , a pro thing . I guess Carl has been watching too much TV . Who is Roy Bremmer ? You see , I have no idea , no idea who that is . You 'll have to ask Carl . - I 'll do that . Can I keep this ? I 'll make you a copy . I need to keep this one . Because I 'm gonna prove this whole thing is , you know , a hoax . Of course , it 's a hoax . I mean , what else could it be ? Uh ... You know , I probably should mention this ... Yesterday I was given a blue parka just like in the file . And today , this morning , the rental car company drops off this green Cherokee just like in the file . You asked me why I changed my mind about this thing . When I got home last night , my wife , she told me I had a doctor 's appointment next week . I 've blown off a couple already , so if I miss this one , she really will wring my neck . Next Tuesday , 2 : 00 P M. , same time as the autopsy , so you miss the autopsy . Get me a copy of this , will you ? - Yeah . As soon as you can . - Thanks . Dr. Anderson to oncology . Oh , hey , Dan , Dan ! Hey , what are you doing here ? - I need a favor . A stress test , maybe ? some oxygen ? No , can you check the blood on this against mine ? What 's this ? - It 's a bullet fragment . Where would you get ... wait ... why would the blood match ... I 'll explain later . I just ... I need it as quickly as possible . Thanks . No . I 've got to go ... That 's great . No , I appreciate that . I 'll get back to you as soon as I can . I know , that was good , thanks . One moment , please . This is outrageous . spectacular work . - How can I prove it was Photoshopped ? You mean , aside from you standing there breathing ? Yoshi 's got this big voodoo machine down in Composing . He can scan it for tampering . - Good . Ever heard of this guy ... Roy Bremmer ? No . Hey , how come I 'm not on this list ? I 'm a close friend . I 'm definitely badder than Brad or Claudia . How can I find out who he is ? - I can search our database . Hey , lighten up , son . How come you 're so worked up about this ? You went to the police . They 're on it , right ? Right , right , yeah . Can I use your copier ? Yeah . Don 't you just love the sunshine today ? It 's beautiful . We should go for drinks on the patio after work . That sounds nice . Denorvo Insurance . Hi , Amy , JT , is she there yet ? Sorry , JT , as soon as she gets in , I 'll have her call you , okay ? Okay , thanks . ... this kind of weather , you just want a light jacket . That wraps it up for the Seattle area ... partly cloudy with mostly cool breezes . Oh , this just in ... It 's not going to be sunny long according to the Doppler , we have a storm coming in off the coast . sorry , folks , get out the rain gear . Huh , Claudia , it 's me . Where are you ? I 've tried your office , I 've tried your cell . I need to talk to you about the file . Call me when you get this , okay ? Wow ! Blowing up stuffs for grades . Now , how cool is that ? JT , you just missed it , I 'm so close . Yeah ... - A transparent material capable of withstanding 170 Gs . - Bradley . It will replace every window in the first world . I wouldn 't mind owning the patent on that one . Have you been to the police yet ? Yeah , we got to find out what this thing is made of . so you can figure out who sent it . - Yeah ... Okay , let 's do it . I 'll be right back . This is really nice . I 'm gonna have to take a shaving from this . Yeah , do whatever you gotta do . You know how long it 's gonna take ? Well , it depends . Can I blow it up ? Kidding . Call me . - I will . I knew him . He was a dealer ? - Coke . Yeah , he 's a weird dude . What 's going on , guys ? This big cop just dragged that Carl guy out of here . Emphasis on dragged . Okay , I 'm gonna have to cancel today , I 'm sorry . I 'll make it up . Double session on Thursday . Get closer together . Closer together , kids , here we go . All right , ready ? smile . - Cheese . Do not touch me . - Come back here and sit . I 've seen those shows with the good-cop-bad-cop . You 're gonna knock me around . Professor . - You get the copies ? Why am I here ? - Try criminal harassment ... which is gonna land you in prison where you 'll acquire a whole new definition of " physics . " Hmm ? - What is that ? No one 's gonna hurt you , Carl , just tell us why you did it . Carl , is that the special project you said would blow my mind ? No . - Any mope can make a threat , but a genius needs a genius twist . You 're a genius , aren 't you , Carl ? Where did you get the paperwork ? someone in this department ? This isn 't my handwriting . You forged my signature to make it look real . Who helped you , Carl ? Give me a name . It 's dated ... Friday ? ! Maybe it wasn 't even your idea . You were just a dupe . That 's weird . That 's so weird . That 's so weird . I 'm giving you one chance to get out in front of this , Carl . Lookie , lookie , lookie , look , look , look . Look , look , look ... what 's this ? He didn 't do this . It 's all right , everybody , let 's ... come on inside . It looks like it 's going to storm . - Keep going , keep going . Here we go . - Hurry . Hurry , hurry , hurry . Ah , Claudia , banker 's hours . Did Michael cut the paychecks yet ? No , he 's working on them right now . Forgot to pay the electric again ? - You know me . ... nasty weather . Come on . No . Yes . Victoria Jamieson . Okay . Victoria Jamieson , my new identity . Oh , you 're a lifesaver . Margaritas for dinner ? My treat . I still owe you for last time . You know what , Amy , I can 't tonight . I really need to get going . But you know , huh ... I think you 're great . And I would love to , but I can 't . salted brims , limes , nachos ... I can 't . Say hi to Billy . - Okay , see you tomorrow . Okay . - Okay . Claudia . Listen , it 's okay . I 'm glad I found you . I need you to pick up Jess today . I 'm not ... - You know where it is , right ? It 's an emergency , I 'll explain later . No , I ... - I 'll see you later . Hello , hello ! Hello , hello . Yeah ? - Yeah , listen , the oak tree , it 's going to fall . You 've got to get out now ! You got to be kidding me . This tree has been through a lot worse than this . Yeah , I know , but you 've got to believe me . Hey , Butchie , shut up . There 's not much time , come on . What are you ? some sort of a city works guy or a tree maintenance guy ? No , I 'm a physicist . - Oh , you 're a physicist . Listen , that oak tree is not going to survive the storm . It 's going to fall , Mandy , and when it does ... How do you know my name ? - I ... Get off my porch ! - No , wait , you 've got to believe me . How does that feel ? You need to get out now ! Take it easy . - Let go ! Take it easy . No , no . - Come on ! All right , just one more step . Okay , run . My God . You saved my life . How can I ever thank you ? It 's real . Hey , are you picking me up ? Where 's Dad ? something came up . You 're getting wet . Hi , Claudia , it 's me . Where are you ? I 've tried your office , I 've tried your cell . I need to talk to you about the file . Call me when you get this . Was there mechanical problem ? Not at all . - You don 't like how it handles ? It handles great ... - It 's the top of the line ... leather interior , cherry sound system , GPs . Miss Whitney specifically ordered it for you . Wait , what did she ask for exactly ? she said " Give me the best one in the lot " . Well , you did that . I thank you . Now I want something else . Okay , I 'll put that on your Visa . Is that cop with you ? No , he isn 't . Carl , I 'm alone . I need to talk to you , please . You still have those papers , Carl ? The thesis advisor consent forms ? - Yeah . Yeah , why don 't you get them ? And ... Okay , I am now your thesis advisor . And this is your assignment . I 'm sure that you won 't be afraid of wherever that might lead you . I am already there . The shadow on the form from the paperclip ? Yeah , and other things . But it takes time to create a mark like that , right ? Years , decades even and the forms are current , but the paper is old and crumbly ... which means somebody either manufactured the effect , or the ... or ... - Or ? It 's from the future . Okay , do you have proof ? It predicted a random event which happened this afternoon . I knew it , I knew it was possible . - Carl . It proves the theory of infinite parallel universes . Okay , stay with me . I need you . I want you to explain how this happened . show me the math , the physics , the implications of transferring an object through space and time . Okay , did it just show up on your desk ? Was it in anything ? It was in a metal briefcase . We 're analyzing the composition right now . Lightweight , but very strong . so the file is inside the case . - Yeah . Inside the file are written documents and photographs . Anything else ? My lost keys . I had them yesterday morning . But by the afternoon , they were gone . Before or after you got the case ? - After . Anything else ? Yes , a spent bullet with dried blood on it and also a whole bullet , which was found at the scene . Wait ... bullets ? Oh , yeah , you die on Friday . Well ... not if I can help it , Carl . All righty , it 's all here , good luck . You know , maybe you can 't help it , maybe it 's your destiny . I don 't believe that . - Believe ? Just think about all the different things that have happened since that case arrived ... I 'm now your thesis advisor , for one . I knew a scientist who used to tell his students to check their beliefs at the lab door , at least until they could be proven . Well , I now believe that scientist was wrong , Carl . Dad , look , you got some flowers . I 've got to meet a client . I 've got to go . Uh , Claudia , can you come back later ? I 've got to talk to you . It 's about something very important . JT , you son of a bitch . Oh , hey , girls . - Hi . Turn on the TV , your dad is all over the news . Why ? - He 's a damn hero . What did you do , Dad ? - Oh , nothing much ... just saved a woman 's life . - What ? ! Here we are at the town of Everett 's famous landmark ... the Weatherby Oak . " The oak is no more " as they say . Maybe it 's the acorn . Mandy , we hear you lost your house . Mandy Murphy ... that 's who the flowers are from . The oak fell on my house and everything was destroyed . I 've got something else for you too . It 's about that Bremmer character . This is him . - All right , so who is he ? All the action on the south side of Chicago is controlled by a handful of guys . - And he 's one of them ? No , he controls a handful of guys ... very private , very connected . Claudia , you 're from Chicago . You ever ran into this character ? Yeah , we used to party all the time , him and me and the mayor . Oh yeah , right . I 've got to run . I 'm late . Can I see you for a sec ? - Huh ? Yeah . What 's up ? ... and I 'm just happy that we are okay . Man 's best friend and his mom and I guess you 're both okay and we 're glad for that . Okay , Mandy , you take care . Goodbye , JT . Whoo ! What did you do to deserve her ? Hello ? - I have to talk to you . Claudia , where are you ? - Look outside . What ? ! What are you doing out there ? Why don 't you come in ? No , I need you to come out here , JT . All right . Jess , stay here . Claudia , you 're all right ? What 's going on ? Is it the file ? If it 's about the file , I wish I could tell you ... There 's nothing to it , but after ... - It 's not about the file . JT , just listen to me , okay ? What ? I know Roy Bremmer . You know Roy Bremmer ? Wait a minute . I don 't unders ... how ? Is he a client of yours or ... No , he 's not a client . Well , what is he ? Did something happen in Chicago ? Did you cross the guy in some way ? Did you testify against him ? I don 't ... Claudia ? I married him . And I 'm still married to him . I 'm sorry . How did you think that ... not telling me ... why ... how ... why would you not tell me ? I 've lived in five different places in the last two years . I 've changed my identity three times and I 'm about to change it again . I only came back here to warn you . Why ... why ... why didn 't you divorce him ? Roy takes that " till death do us part " clause literally . Oh , damn it . Jesse ! I don 't like being left out . I want to know what 's going on . Hey , no ! That 's enough !

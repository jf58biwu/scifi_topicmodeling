 Vodka rocks , please . Hi , how are you ? Thirsty . Uh , straight up , and no ice this time . I tell this guy ... about the ice , and then he pours me ... a scotch rocks . " About the ice " ? The water , actually , in the ice . I 'm kind of an expert on it . Well , what 's wrong with it ? No big secret . It 's been in the news . A government additive . Something they call chloramine . Yeah , they said it 's good for us . It 's like fluoride or something . Well , that 's what they say . Look , um ... I didn 't sit down here to scare you . On the contrary . Would you like to get some air ? A long way to go for a drink , huh ? Do you like living out here ? How much farther ? Just over the bridge . [ Alarm Blaring ] [ Engine Revs ] What the hell you doing ? [ Tires Screeching ] Let go ! You 're going to kill us ! [ Whoosh ] [ Whoosh ] [ Announcer ] Last season on The X-Files . There was a rumored program out of the Cold War . Aplan to create a Super Soldier . [ Doggett ] I didn 't want to believe it . Said Agent Scully 's a part of their program too . Your baby was a miracle . My baby is normal . She may never make it out of this building . Get him off ! This is my baby ! Please don 't let them take it ! You got to push , Dana . [ Doggett ] This office ... is under investigation ... for a late-night meeting ... between you and an intelligence operative ... named Knowle Rohrer . You investigate what I tell you . And you put me on the X-Files . [ Mulder ] I think what we feared were the possibilities . The truth we both know . [ Baby Crying ] It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's going to be okay . [ Alarm Clock Buzzing ] [ Groans ] [ Phone Ringing ] Hello ? [ Man ] Monica , it 's me . Did I wake you ? Brad ? Um , n-no . No , I 'm awake . You 're in town . Yeah , l-I came in on short notice . Listen , if you 're coming to the Hoover Building ... can you stop by my office on your way in ? Yeah . Sure . I can do that . Good . Looking forward to it . [ Whistling ] [ Woman Over TV ] And now a story ... that may have long-term effects here in Washington . Metro Police are investigating the bizarre death ... of a government employee last night . The body of 38-year-old Carl Wormus ... a deputy administrator ... for the Environmental Protection Agency ... was pulled from the Potomac by rescue divers this morning . It appears Wormus drove his car through a barricade ... and off a drawbridge into the river . A police spokesperson says ... it appears he was alone in the car ... Monica ? Hi . What are you doing ? I was leaving you a note . Your assistant was out , and I didn 't want to knock . I was going to call you ... Hi , Brad . Come on in . [ Door Closes ] What ? We 're at work . You used to ask me to close the door at work ... back in New York . Is that all you called me here for ... Assistant Director ? I probably shouldn 't tell you how hot you look , either ... 'cause you do . How long has it been ? T-Two years ? Yeah . Yeah . We should catch up , Brad , really . I 've got to get downstairs . I have got something for you . Forgive me , but , uh ... it didn 't take a whole lot of digging ... to figure out why you 're here in D.C. , Monica . What are those ? Something you 're going to see , but I wanted to show you first . They were taken from the security cameras ... in the FBI parking garage . One of them shows you arriving in a cab meeting John Doggett . Yeah , I 'm working with him . He called me up here on a case . I heard , believe me . This whole thing about a chase and a crash and a fire ... And now ... Doggett 's internal investigation of Deputy Director Kersh . It 's big news . What 's so important to show me ? What 's on the other tape ? [ Elevator Bell Dings ] [ Door Closes ] How 's your investigation going , John ? Have you turned up ... any incriminating evidence on me yet ? It 's only Monday morning , sir . It 's nothing personal , Deputy Director . I hope you know that . No , John . I think we 've pretty much always seen eye-to-eye . [ Door Opens ] I 'm sure ... if you can 't find anything on me , John , nobody can . Hi . How you doing ? That good . I didn 't ask to be put down in the X-Files . Deputy Director Kersh put me down here . I 'm just doing my job . What did he think ? That I 'd be thankful ? That I 'd do anything less ? It 's not going to be easy , John . Hell , no , it isn 't . We 're going after a Deputy Director . One man removed from the head of the FBI . No , I mean , it may be impossible . What 's this ? A security tape , two nights ago , from the FBI garage . You 're not on it . What are you talking about ? No . This is the wrong damn tape . I 've been backwards and forwards on it . There 's nothing there . We were chased . A.D. Skinner and I were attacked and chased . This man Knowle Rohrer drove his car into the garage wall . It blew up in a ball of flames . Not on this tape . Where 'd you get this ? From someone who wanted to give me a heads up . They can 't just make this all go away . There 's evidence down in that parking garage . There were victims . I went down to that garage , John . Whatever happened , they 've had 48 hours now to clean it up . There were witnesses . Witnesses who are going to stand up to this tape ? [ Door Shuts ] [ Pounding ] Mulder ! Mulder , are you here ? [ Man On Phone ] Naval Telecommunications Command . Yeah , I need to make a shore to ship call ... to the S.S. Valor Victor ... Sir ? Sir ? [ Knocking ] What ? What 's the matter ? What 's the matter ? ! I 've been trying to call you . Yeah , but ... the phone 's off the hook because of the baby . Well , I got panicked you weren 't going to be here . That you left , too . Come in . I went looking for Mulder . I went to his apartment . I know . Where did he go ? Dana ... where did he go ? He 's gone . He 's just gone . I don 't know where Mulder is . I don 't know that I 'd tell you if I did . [ Door Opens ] I checked with movers , airlines , car rental agencies . No Mulder . Somebody get to him ? That it ? Doesn 't seem possible , does it ? Okay , so where does that leave us ? It 's just me and you . Our word against Kersh and the FBI . You better sit down , John . It 's more complicated than that . What 's more complicated ? This investigation . What about it ? I want to ask you to drop it . No . Not from you . Not from you . Not-Not after what we 've been through . I mean , we barely escaped with our lives . That 's something worth thinking about . I 'm sorry , you 're not that reasonable . What , did they get to you , too ? No one got to me , John . They didn 't have to . That 's the point . You 're afraid of them . I 'm not afraid of them . Well , you 're afraid of something . What ? The real tape showing up , them calling you a killer ... for you having to shoot Alex Krycek ? No , I 'll stand by my actions , Agent Doggett ... but I won 't stand by yours ... if you 're going to continue to push and push ... until you get somebody killed . You want to know what I fear ? I fear for Mulder and Scully . I fear for the life of that child ... if you don 't stop pushing , John . You don 't think I fear for those things , same as you ? If you did , you 'd let it go . So what I 'm hearing is ... if I don 't drop it , I 'm alone on this . [ Sighs ] John . You 're not . [ Door Shuts ] Hi . I hope it wasn 't presumptuous of me . I ordered you a martini . No , the presumption 's all mine . Anyway , I called and asked you out , didn 't I ? You , uh , actually had me confused a little ... this morning in my office . I had this crazy notion that , uh , you were avoiding me . Maybe I was trying to avoid myself . And those tapes you pulled out of your desk drawer ... weren 't exactly Pamela and Tommy Lee , now , were they ? [ Chuckles ] And I 'd heard ... that , uh , that you and John Doggett were tight . You make it sound like I go home from work ... with Post-Its on my ass . It 's nothing like that . Then I don 't get it . Why risk your name and your career ... getting caught up in this ... rabid investigation of his ? There isn 't going to be an investigation . Not anymore . I wouldn 't have thought Agent Doggett ... would be thrown off so easy . Not what I 've heard about him . Whatever you may think about him , Brad ... he 's not a fool , you know . Now you 're pissed off at me . No , I 'm pissed off ... because this means I 'll be shipping back ... to the New Orleans Field Office . What are you talking about ? The way I heard it , you 're with the X-Files . This investigation drops ... they 're going to drop the X-Files right along with it . You know me ... where my interests lie . This was my dream assignment . Not to mention how excited I was ... to be up here in D.C. But you just got here . Yeah , I know . [ Knocking ] I 'm really sorry . I ... Dana , I need your help . I don 't how to find him . It just doesn 't make any sense . Mulder leaving you here all alone . Just walking out on you ? Not telling you ... where and why ? It makes sense in its own way . That 's all I can tell you . Then tell me why you can 't trust me . Everything I did to try to protect you ... when you thought your baby was in danger ... what changed ? Why is it suddenly I 'm now the enemy ? Let it go , John . Drop it . Please . These people tried to kill me . They tried to kill A.D. Skinner . They would have killed Mulder , too . They 're still out there , Dana . Exactly right . And they are unstoppable . And they are inside the FBI . You know something you 're not telling me . Mulder knows something . How long can you hide from it ? Knowle Rohrer ... this old military buddy of mine ... he told me your pregnancy was a result ... of a government cloning experiment to try and create ... what he called a " Super Soldier . " I don 't want to hear this . Look , there is nothing to any of this . Knowle Rohrer ... my buddy ... was one of the men that tried to kill us in the FBI garage . My baby ... my son ... is fine . I hope to God that 's true . I just don 't want to pretend . I 'm going to ask you to leave . I 'm going to ask you to leave and not come back here . [ Door Shuts ] [ Woman ] Directory assistance , may I help you ? Let 's try , uh , Maryland or Virginia . What listing , please ? The number for a Ryan Bracker . B-R-A-C-K-E-R . Yeah , hi , I was given this number for a Roger Erickson ... formerly of the U.S. Marine Corps . Yeah , speaking . Roger ? Hey , it 's John Doggett , Bravo Company . Hey , man , how you doing ? I 'm good . It 's good to hear you . Listen , you remember Knowle Rohrer ? Yeah , sure I remember him . What 's the story with him ? Didn 't he get involved in something ... when we got back stateside ... Special Ops ? I have no idea , man . I never heard from Knowle after we got back . Hey , we should get together , catch up . Yeah , let 's , um , let 's catch a beer sometime . This is Shannon . Leave a message and I 'll return it as soon as I can . Yeah , hi , this is John Doggett . I 'm trying to reach a Shannon McMahon ... who was with Bravo Company , USMC . If this is she , could you please contact me ... through the FBI in Washington , D.C. , as soon as possible ? [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Sleepy time , sweet William . I 'll see you in a couple hours . [ Mobile Squeaking ] [ Squeaking Continues ] [ Sighs ] [ Heavy Sigh ] [ Footsteps ] Hello ? [ Sighs ] [ Baby Crying ] [ Mobile Squeaking ] [ Baby Crying ] [ Mobile Squeaking ] [ Crying Continues ] [ Crying Stops ] [ Crying ] [ Mobile Squeaking ] [ Phone Rings ] Monica Reyes . Uh , yeah , it 's , uh ... it 's Scully . Dana ? What 's wrong , are you all right ? Is Agent Doggett there ? Yeah , he 's right here with me . Dana ? Is something wrong ? Yeah ... yeah , something . Um ... I think I might have been wrong ... telling you to drop your investigation . No , I didn 't drop it . As a matter of fact , we found something . I 'm not sure how it fits , but we 're working on it . What is it ? A body . Thanks for comin ' . The deceased 's name ... is Carl Wormus ... Deputy Administrator ... for the Environmental Protection Agency . Drove through a barricade and off a bridge two nights ago . And ? And somebody at the FBI thought it was important enough ... to stick his obituary under our noses . Who ? [ Reyes ] We don 't know . Well , his blood alcohol level was upwards of.15. He was drunk , he ... crashed and drowned . There 's got to be something more . [ Cell Phone Rings ] John Doggett . What the hell are you doing ? Excuse me ? Do you know how many people ... are just waiting to see you screw up ? To see you make a mistake like this ? I didn 't know I made a mistake . This EPA guy that you checked out of the county morgue ... in Maryland ... without any jurisdiction ... Oh , come on . All your friends , John . All your former buddies at the FBI . What are you talking about ? They 're not your pals anymore . Not since this investigation of yours . Since you 've launched an attack on one of your own . Just watch your back , John . [ Slams Receiver Down ] Definitive answer how this guy died . What would that take ? A careful autopsy . How fast can you do it ? That 's not what I 'm saying . I 'd understand if you don 't want to do this , Dana ... but you 're the only person we can trust . [ Doorbell Rings ] Collecting for the needy and unemployed . Open the door . Thanks for doing this , guys . Yeah , like we 've got anything better ... to be doing these days . Just to let you know ... we may need to hit you up for some coin . Why ? What happened to you guys ? Don 't ask . We were able to hack ... into the Department of Interior 's mainframe ... and get the EPA files you wanted ... on this man Carl Wormus . And ? Hey . What are we , mind readers ? That 's all you asked us to do . What exactly was it ... you were looking for , if we may ask ? I don 't know , I was hoping you 'd find something . Well , if he had any secrets , he took them to his grave . Nothing hinky in his files ... except some kind of rabid obsession with water . With water ? Water . Asphyxiation induced by the inhalation of water . There are contusions on the forehead and on the chest ... but the impact isn 't what killed him . This man drowned . You 're looking at me ... like you hope that there 's something more ... but there isn 't . I 'm sorry , that 's not it . I 'm just impressed that you can do this . This is what I do , Agent Reyes . But you 're here doing it now . Something did happen , didn 't it ? I know what you 're afraid of . That there 's something wrong with your baby . We can let our fears get the better of us . We can , uh ... imagine things , make connections with things that aren 't there . Like with this man . If you ever feel the need to talk to someone , Dana , I 'm here . I 'd never betray a confidence . There is something . What ? Right here on the ankle . Are those ... fingerprints ? Yeah , that 's what they look like . From someone holding him down ? I don 't know how or who . [ Follmer ] I don 't know if you 're aware of where Agent Scully is . She 's at Quantico . Called in byJohn Doggett to autopsy a body ... he 's got no authority to touch . If I may be blunt , sir ... Doggett 's put his tit in the wringer . Maybe . So what ? A lot of us think ... that he 's lost all judgment . And one man 's actions should not affect the entire FBI . We feel he should be called out for this . Punished . Yes , sir . Thank you , Assistant Director . It 's a difficult situation to be in . I appreciate you doing this . It was the right thing to do . Let me know how it goes . Me ? Oh , no , l-I can 't , sir . There-There 's a conflict . L-I can 't do this myself . I can 't very well do it . How would it look ? I 'm under investigation by Agent Doggett . You have no personal ax to grind . [ Doorbell Rings ] Hello , can I help you ? Hi , I 'm looking for Dana Scully . I 'm sorry . She 's not here right now . Can I tell her who 's calling ? We work together . Do you know where I can find her ? No . Um ... would you like to leave a message ? [ Doorknob Squeaking ] I 'll leave her a note ... if you wouldn 't mind opening the door . Why don 't you just leave your name ... and I 'll have Dana call you . [ Sighs ] You need to get this body into refrigeration ... if you 're going to preserve him as evidence . Whatever he 's evidence of . Whatever it is , I can 't reach John to even tell him about it . Monica , I don 't know what to say ... but good luck . I 've got to go . I 've got to get home . Third floor , they have a cooler ... for the teaching cadavers . You might temporarily put him up there . Behind us . Just keep walking . Who is she ? I 've never seen her before this morning . Now I 've seen her twice . [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Excuse us . Where 's Agent Doggett ? What are you doing , Brad ? What am I doing ? I 'm doing my best to cover your ass . What are you talking about ? This , this . I 'm talking about these . Let go of me . What 's going on here ? Okay , where 'd he go ? Who ? Where 'd who go ? Where did Doggett take the body ? You 're not making any sense , Brad . Agent Doggett didn 't take any body anywhere . What , you 're looking at me ... like you don 't believe me . Ask Agent Scully . I 'm going to go now . I 've got a child at home . Body or no body , you were here doing an autopsy . Doggett was here ... without authorization . Without authorization ? He 's out of control , you know , Monica . Forget the X-Files . He 'll take you down with him . This was you , wasn 't it ? You floated that obituary to me ... to set Agent Doggett up . Using me ? What obituary ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . You came to me for help , remember ? I 'm only trying to help you help yourself . I know exactly what you 're doing , Brad . Don 't forget to piss on all the corners before you leave . I didn 't float any obituary . What is she talking about ? [ Doorbell Ringing ] Son of a ... Yeah ? Oh . Hello . Considering the recent violence attempted on Agent Doggett ... you might want to know who 's at the door ... before you actually open it . Next time I 'll get a chair . Agent Doggett 's gone . What do you mean gone ? He and Assistant Director Skinner ... split for Maryland together . Show her what we found ... before she makes any nasty remarks . It took some real hacking ... but Carl Wormus , the man from ... the Environmental Protection Agency ... who drowned in his car ? He 'd been receiving encrypted e-mail data ... from a water reclamation plant in Maryland . From a worker there named Roland McFarland . Encrypted data on what ? Don 't know . But whatever it is , may have gotten ... both these men killed . There are no nameplates . Yeah , I see that . This is madness . Even if you 're right ... and this guy connects to your investigation ... we don 't know we 're in the right area . This has got to be McFarland 's area . This might be his desk . Let 's just grab the computer hard drive ... and get out of here . We 're not sure if it 's his . Somebody 's going to come walking through ... one of these doors any minute and it 's not going to matter . Just keep an eye out . What 's chloramine ? What ? Why are you asking me about chloramine ? Because this is McFarland 's desk ... and he 's got tons of files on chloramine in it . I 'm betting it figures into all this somehow . Agent Doggett . Grab the files and go . Shh . [ Yells ] [ Follmer ] Assistant Director ! Looks like you and I are chasing the same man . Agent Doggett ? [ Child ] I made this . !

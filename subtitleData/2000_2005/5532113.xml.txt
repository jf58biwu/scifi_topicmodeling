 We are not alone . Forget what you think you know . Forget what your mother told you when she tucked you in at night . Forget the lies of our oppressive cabalistic allied governments . Behind this curtain is the very secret they do not want you to see . The most astounding scientific find in the history of humanity ! Proof of alien life ! That 's right . Go ahead and laugh , sir , but what you see inside this room ... will change your life forever . It will haunt your dreams and harrow , yes , your very soul ! - Yep . It 's a cow fetus . - I guess so . It does seem to have an awful lot of limbs . - It 's mutated . - But cow ? How do you figure ? It 's upside down . Oh , yeah . Cow . Yep . And I 'm out 12 bits . I really know how to show a girl a ... disgusting time . Oh , it 's sweet . Poor little thing never even saw the light of day . Now it 's in show business . You manage to find the bright side of every single thing . Also , we 've ... got this booth to ourselves for five whole minutes . - We 're not alone , remember ? - He 's not gonna squawk . Tell me more good stuff about me . Uh , well , you 're , uh- - You 're kind of a genius when it comes to machines . You always say what you mean . - And your eyes are- - - Yeah ? Eyes . Yeah ? And , um- - I don 't know how to , um- - Oh . Plus , every other girl I know is either ... married , professional or closely related to me , so ... you 're more or less--you 're literally the only girl in the world . Hmm . That 's a hell of a thing to say . - I was joking . - Oh , no , no . I get it . I do . Back on Osiris you probably had nurses ... and debutantes crawling all over you ... but down here at the bottom of the barrel , it 's just me . - No . That 's- - That 's not even- - - Well , I 'm glad I rated higher than dead bessie here . Oh , and there 's something in a jar . Scare her away again , did you ? Uh , this may come as a shock ... but I 'm actually not very good at- - at talking to girls . Why , is there someone you are good at talking to ? Do not fear me . Ours is a peaceful race and we must live in harmony . - Struck out again ? - It 's like something out of a fable . I got this priceless artifact- - the biggest score of my career , and no one will touch it . The Lassiter is universally known . Fencing it is like fencing the Mona Lisa . Well , wh- - The Mona who ? You 're out of your league . You should consider my offer . I 'm done thinking about that , and you are to stay clear . - I know people in the highest ranks of- - - Jabber , jabber , jabber . I ain 't listening . Just ' cause you helped out on the job , don 't make you a crook . And I will not have you jeopardizing your career over this . The career you abhor and look down on ? I just don 't want you in the way of trouble . Just take it as you like . Amnon ! - How you been ? - Malcolm . An old friend 's face is a balm in this age . - I read your wave . You holdin ' some post for me ? - Yeah . Got quite a haul . - You can sign for everyone , right ? - Sure . - Any packages for me ? - Don 't know yet . My food is problematic . Girl 's a mind-reading genius , can 't even figure out how to eat ice planet . - Did you get everything ? - Yeah . They didn 't have rounds for the Buhnder , but we 're ammo 'd up pretty good . Got a good discount on account of my intimidating manner . This one 's addressed to you and Zoe , Mal . - I don 't remember ordering any parts . - The little one 's for Cobb . I got post ? Might we all wanna step a few paces back before he opens that ? Ha ha . It 's from my mother . So , do aliens live among us ? Yeah . One of them 's a doctor . " My dear boy , I hope you are well- - and that you get this soon in your tra ... vels . Travels . " - Did you order any equipment ? - No , sir . " Thank you for the credits you forwarded . They have helped ... " as Mattie is still sick with the- - I made you the enclo- - " Ooh ! Enclosed . Huh . ' ... enclosed to keep you warm in your travels . " Hope to hear from you soon ... Love , your mother . " How 's it sit ? Pretty cunning , don 't you think ? I think it 's the sweetest hat ever . A man walks down the street in that hat , people know he 's not afraid of anything . - Damn straight ! - Well , let 's hope ... we get some funny hats too . What 'd y 'all order a dead guy for ? ~ Take my love , take my land ~ ~ Take me where I cannot stand ~ ~ I don 't care , I 'm still free ~ ~ You can 't take the sky from me ~ ~ Take me out to the black ~ ~ Tell them I ain 't comin 'back ~ ~ Burn the land and boil the sea ~ ~ You can 't take the sky from me ~ ~ There 's no place I can be ~ ~ Since I 've found serenity ~ ~ But you can 't take the sky from me ~ ~ Oh ! Thanks . I didn 't know you were out there . Sort of the point . Stealth . You may have heard of it . I don 't think they covered that in basic . Well , at least they covered dropping your weapon ... so you can eat beans and get yourself shot . Yeah , I got a badge in that . Won 't happen again . It does , I 'm just gonna watch . See anything interesting out there- - if you don 't mind my asking . About 30 troops behind those buildings . Mortars . No rollers yet . I expect they plan to peck at us for a spell before they charge . They had two scouts sniffing , but I took ' em down . Wow . I didn 't hear a single thing . First rule of battle , little one ... don 't ever let them know where you are . Whoo-hoo . I 'm right here . I 'm right here . You want some of me ? Yeah , you do . Come on ! Come on ! Aaah ! Unh ! Whoo-hoo . Course , there are other schools of thought . Whew . Ha . That was bracing . They don 't like it when you shoot at ' em . - I worked that out myself . - Did you find Vitelli ? Vitelli 's out of it . That bumblebee laid down arms ... at the first sign of inevitable crushing defeat . Can you imagine such a cowardly creature ? Southwest corridor is open , huh ? - Tracey , ain 't you dead yet ? - Through no fault of my own . - I really wanted your beans . - They 're gonna come right through here . - They got rollers ? - Oh , they got every damn thing . How 's the lieutenant ? Oh , started screaming all of a sudden about his arms . Where 's his arms ? We had to go back and find them . - What the hell happened ? - He ain 't even hurt . He 's got 10 pretty fingers on his hands , like the most of men . But he 's screaming like they 're gone , crying . He ain 't said a word in two hours . He 's- - Sir , do we hold ? I don 't wanna die here . Forgive me saying , this rock ain 't worth it . - Not our lives . - Everybody dies , Tracey . Someone 's carrying a bullet for you right now , doesn 't even know it . The trick is , die of old age before it finds you . We can still cut through to the 22nd at the school system ... make a decent stand there . Well , we can 't do any good here . I sure as hell ain 't gonna lay down arms . Zoe ... you heard the lieutenant give the order to join up with the 22nd . - I did . - Round ' em up then . And you heard the lieutenant too . - I ain 't gonna rat you out . Don 't worry . - Ain 't me I 'm worried on . If the lieutenant gets his mind back , this shouldn 't go on his record . - Ain 't his fault he couldn 't take it . - That 's more than he 'd do- - Seeker ! Incoming ! Aaah ! Ow ! - Is it bad ? Is it bad ? - It 's glorious . - Come on ! We gotta move ! - I can 't . We gotta run ! Zoe , get the lieutenant ! - I can 't . Really . Go . - You know the old saying . Well , it don 't make any kind of sense . - Zoe ? - I got nothing . But it 's definitely Tracey . - You know this guy ? - Is this a warning of some kind ? Listen , Mal , you gotta get this thing outta my station . - Uh- - - No , no , no , no . Human transport on a postal route is very , very illegal . If anyone even knows I took a corpse in , I 'll lose my franchise . - Well , who sent it ? - I don 't know . There 's no return . - How long has it been here ? - Near a week , that 's why I waved you . It can 't stay here . - He don 't smell . - I know . Been decently preserved . Give me a hand . - We 're taking him on board ? - We are . Don 't know if I see the percentage in that . Then don 't strain your brain trying . Might break something . We got it . What 's going on ? Did we get something fun ? You are such a boob . - How do we know he ain 't plague-ridden or some such ? - We know . We don 't actually . I respect that you guys have a history , but what are you doing ? - If you want me to do a proper autopsy- - - Cut him up ? Not just yet . Thank you , Doctor . Robot . What do you got ? Uh , okay . Um , recording . Hi , I guess . This is a message for Zoe and for Malcolm Reynolds ... and I really hope you all are the ones listening to it . I 'll spare you the boring details . I 've fallen in with untrustworthy folk . Making a bunch of bad calls . All that matters is I expect to be shuffled off ... and you two are the only people I trust to get me where I 'm going ... which is home . I 'd like my body to be with my folks on St. Albans . We got the family plot there and my mom and dad ... well , they deserve to know I died . You know , it 's funny . We went to the war never looking to come back ... but it 's the real world I couldn 't survive . You two carried me through that war ... and now I need you to carry me just a little bit further ... if you can . Tell my folks I wanted to do right by them ... and that I 'm at peace and all . When you can 't run anymore , you crawl , and when you can 't do that , well- - Yeah , you know the rest . Thanks , both of you . Oh , yeah , and , um , make sure my eyes is closed , will you ? Wash ? St. Albans ain 't but a two-day ride , if we burn hard enough . - That might make your schedule a little- - - It 's all right . That 's right gentlemen . You have been told tales all your life . But alien races exist among us ! The proof is right inside . You 'll be amazed and astounded . Can I help you ? You are an ugly looking little quim , you know that ? - Look , if there 's a problem- - - So you have to be asking yourself , ugly as you are ... how repulsive-looking ... the guy that 's gonna make you his little woman is gonna be . Hmm ? I mean prison is a lonely place . You sure as a hundred moons ain 't gonna be pitching . So what kind of sorry-ass troll ... is gonna get blue enough to grapple with you ? - Shudder to think . - I 've broken no law . Transportation of human cargo , especially dead cargo , through the Allied postal system ... is punishable by 5 to 10 years on a penal moon . Plus , you don 't know this yet , but you resisted arrest . - Wha- - Wh- - - Where 's my body ? - I- - I- - I don 't know . - The dead guy . He got shipped here . And shipped back out , I guess . Where ? I never saw a body . But wait . There was a crate big enough for one . I mean , I did hand that over just a little while ago . Lovely . Who got it ? Um ... Here . Malcolm Reynolds . Where do you suppose he 's off to ? He- - He captains a Firefly . Y-You should be able to catch him if you leave now . - Are you telling me to leave ? - Well , no , no . I didn 't mean that . Relax . You 've been great . And I was just bluffing with that stuff about arresting you . I mean , who needs that kind of paperwork ? Skunk , light him on fire . No . I- - I- - I told you everything . I- - Really ! No . Come on ! Come on ! I- - I told you ! I told you what I knew ! What- - What are you doing ? I- - I- - Tell anyone we were here ... warn Captain Reynolds that we 're coming ... and you 'll wish that we 'd burned you . Dong ma ? Good . Boys , let 's go find us a corpse . I really hope you all are the ones listening to it . I 'll spare you the boring details . I 've fallen in with untrustworthy folk . Making a bunch of bad calls . All that matters is I expect to be shuffled off ... and you two are the only people I trust to get me where I 'm going ... which is home . I 'd like my body to be with my folks on St. Albans . We got the family plot there and my mom and dad ... well , they deserve to know I died . You know , it 's funny . We went to the war never looking to come back ... but it 's the real world I couldn 't survive . Ho- - Oh , sorry , Preacher . Am I making too much noise ? No , no . I was just ... saying a few words . Don 't know the boy 's denomination , but- - Oh , no , it 's good . The Lord should oughta look after the dead . You wanna do a set ? I 'll spot you . I 'm not so terribly in the mood . Yeah . Most people is pretty quiet about now . Me , I see a stiff- - one I didn 't have to kill myself ... I just get the urge to , you know , do stuff ... like work out or run around . Maybe get some trim if there 's a willing ' woman about . Not that I get flush with corpses or anything . - I ain 't crazy . - Makes sense . Lookin ' to feel alive , I would venture . Now , for psychology , that don 't sound half dumb . My kinda life don 't last long , Preacher ... so expect I 'm invested in making good sport of it whilst I can . You gonna read over me when I get taken down , Shepherd ? - Oh , I suspect you 'll be around long after we 're all- - - What the hell is she doing ? - What the hell are you doing ? - Oh , River , that might not be the best place- - I 'm very comfortable . I guess we do all have different reactions to death . I thought I was gonna die . - How could he possibly- - - Oh , well , the colonel was dead drunk . Three hours pissing 'on about the enlisted men . Uh , " They 're scum . " Uh , " They 're not fighters . " And , uh- - And then he passed right out . Boom . We couldn 't even move him ... so , uh , Tracey just snipped it right off his face . And you never seen a man more proud of his moustache than Colonel Obrin . I mean , in all my life , I will never love a woman ... the way this officer loved that lip ferret . - Big walrusy thing- - all waxed up . - Yeah . - Did he find out ? - Oh , next morning , he wakes up . It 's gone , and he is furious . - But he can 't just say , you know , " Someone stole my mustache ! " So , he , uh , calls together all the platoons . We thought he was gonna shoot us . Oh , he 's eyeballing ' all the men something fierce . Not a word . And he comes up to Tracey , and Tracey 's wearing the gorram thing on his face ! He had glued it on . He 's staring the old man down wearing his own damn moustache . Ha . Oh . Oh , God . Well , the colonel must 've said some- - - Are we hit ? - That 's too damn close . They 're behind us . Fired over the port bow . - Warning shot ? - They coulda hit us . - Feds . - This is Lieutenant Womack of Allied Enforcement . You are in possession of stolen goods and are ordered ... to cut thrust and prepare for docking . - The Lassiter . - That was quick . Do you think Saffron tipped them off ? This is Captain Reynolds . I think there 's been a mistake . There 's been a lot of mistakes , Captain . The latest of which is you taking that crate . Crate ? Um , we took in a lot of inventory today . If something got mixed in , we 'll be sure and hand it back . I don 't think we 're your men . Let me check through the cargo . Is it marked at all ? I 'd think twice about playing games with me there , mister . I will blow you to pieces . Oh , you do that , your precious crate gonna be in bitty shards . Now , I got deliveries to make , Officer , so you just lock onto my trajectory ... and I 'll take a look here , see if anything matches your description . Police procedure has changed since I was little . He calls back , you keep him occupied . - What do I do , shadow puppets ? - We 'll take care of it . I don 't get this . They 're after Tracey ? Unless there 's something else in that box . Anything ? Not unless this crate 's made of magical wish-granting planks . - Check his pockets . - That ain 't right . Neither 's being blowed up . There 's nothing about this sits right with me . - Empty . - They want this body for something ... and I 'm guessin it ain 't a proper burial . Well , Doctor , guess you are doing an autopsy . You really think there 's something in there ? Using corpses for smuggling is a time-honored repulsive custom . Maybe it 's gold . And maybe he was a friend of ours , and you need to show a little respect . I got respect . I 'm just saying- - gold . - He 's been opened before . - How 's that ? It 's , uh , good work . Scar 's nearly invisible , but- - Well , let 's see what 's in there . Get ahold ofhim . Spry for a dead fella . Settle down ! Settle ! That 's enough ! - He was cutting on me , Sarge ! - I know it ! I told him to ! You told him to ? What for ? - ' Cause you were dead ! - Huh ? Oh . Right . I suppose I was . - Hey , there , Zoe . - Private . - You feelin ' a mite calmer now ? - Yes , Sarge . - Um , Sarge- - - Yeah ? I think I 'm nekkid . Oh , um , sorry for jumping on you the way I did . I was a little confounded . Emerging from that state can be disorienting . - Was it Bifodan ? - Hmm ? Can you bring that pan , please ? The drug you took to make it appear as though you were dead . - Remember what it was called ? - Never did ask . Guy who sold it to me said I 'd be under a week or so . He told me I wouldn 't dream , but I did . I dreamt of my family . - You can take that . - All right . You wanna explain to me exactly why you got yourself corpsified and mailed to me ? - What are you running from ? - Running to , not from . I just wanted to get home , that 's all . It 's all I ever wanted . Except there 's them that take exception to that ... to me leaving ... while I was in possession of their property . - What 'd you boost , Tracey ? - Was it gold ? More importantly , who 'd you boost it from ? - Well- - - Captain , I don 't mean to- - We may have a medical emergency here . This man appears to be in cardiac arrest . What ? Tracey , you having a heart attack ? It don 't look like he 's having a heart attack . Don 't pay any attention to your machines , Doc . They 'll fib to you . Heart 's just fine- - better than fine . Just runs a little hotter than usual , that 's all . My God . It 's not just the heart muscle . It 's everything . All the moving parts . That 's what I took , Mal . That 's what they want back . Tracey , are you gonna tell me what in the- - you 're talkin ' about ? Sure , Sarge . Sure . - Thank you . - So your innards ain 't your innards ? They got scooped out , replaced every bit . What 'd you wanna go and do that for ? For the money . They 're paying me to transport what they stuck in . You 're smuggling human organs ? They 're grown in a lab . The only way they can move ' em is in a person . Not sure why . Because the technology 's not ready . Blastomeres are unapproved ... likely unstable . You 're not just a carrier . You 're an incubator . I was supposed to be at the drop spot two weeks ago- - a clinic in Ariel . They were to open me up , take out the goods , and put my own organs back . - So what happened ? - Better offer . Another buyer was willing to go three times the going rate . It 's enough so I could get my folks off that rock they 've been forced to live on ... set them up someplace better , someplace warm . That 's real nice . But your better offer went south ? Yeah . I got myself in a little bit of a pickle , Sarge . The folks I was working for ... must 've got wind of what I had planned . I , uh , showed up . My new buyer was dead ... and there were some men waiting for me . - But you got away . - Only just . I knew they 'd never stop looking for me so long as I was alive . Thought my chances would be better if I weren 't . So you died , and figured they 'd stop looking for you . Yepper . I think maybe you figured wrong . I think they 're about done being stalled to- - Ah ! Aaah ! Mal , your dead army buddy 's on the bridge . - He ain 't dead . - Oh . - How far are we to St. Albans ? - Five minutes from atmo . Oh . Bring up the terrain specs . Kaylee , get him outta here and strap in . - This is Captain Reynolds . - Reynolds ... I 'm a dangerous-minded man on a ship loaded with hurt . Now , why you got me chatting with your peons ? Tracey , you go on down below . We 'll handle this . Uh , uh , well , we 're just seeing to some technical difficulties , Officer . Not interested , Captain . I stepped over a lot ofbodies to get to that one you got in your hold . You play this right , and yours won 't have to be among them . - Sarge- - - The captain ordered you off the bridge . Come on . We 'd love to let you dock , but that last bop you gave us ... knocked out our fore couples , so we 're gonna have to park it if you want the tour . All right , Captain . We can do this on the ground just as easy . Yeah . Easy . There . - Think you can do it ? - Watch me . Attention crew . This is the captain . Sit down and hang on to something . Oh . Oh . Uh , you okay ? - So I- - I can let go of you now ? - Oh , you can . Yeah . All this hard banking . When the gravity drive and actual gravity start working against each other ... it tosses the lunch about a bit . - Your pilot 's pretty wild . - He can thread a needle with this bird . He 's the best . That 's good to know . So are you and he , um-- - Sweeties ? Oh , hell no ! - He 's married to Zoe . - Zoe got married ? Yeah . Yeah , next you 'll be telling me she smiles and has emotions . She must have been such a stone-cold- - during the war . I think the sarge was even a little bit afraid of her . Now she 's married . Well , that 's good- - people making a life for each other . Had enough of this goose run . Don 't need no tour of this ice cube . Now let 's park it . Just looking for a good spot , Officer . - What is it ? - It 's a little strange . There 's a fed station right here ... but our friends haven 't made a transmission since they broke atmo . - So what about you ? - Oh , you know , mostly just m- - - Ohh . - Oh . Stuff like this . Always finding myself in one scrape or another . Yeah . Sorry to drag y 'all into this . Oh . Danger is pretty much our business . Still , if you got put in a bad spot at all , Kaylee , I- - I 'd be real unhappy . Get ready for hard burn ! They 'd be crazy to follow us in here . They 're not behind us anymore ! I didn 't think of that . Aaah ! Oh , no . Whoa-kay . Aaah . Whoo-hoo-hoo ! - This kind of flying really wakes up a guy . - Awake helps . There . I shut down the main power . They might not read our auxiliary under all this . What if they come down , try to get a visual ? Mal , she 's not a small ship . We 're not moving . Why aren 't we moving ? Probably part of some genius plan to give the feds the slip . Yeah . Probably . What was that ? Sounds like full-yield mag drops . I think they picked up a little triangulation in cop school . 1 001 . 1 002 . - River ? - Shh . I 'm counting between the lightning and the thunder ... to see if the storm 's coming or going . 1 005 . Options ? Well , we 're only as good as long as the roof holds out . Direct hit above us , ship 's electrics will be fried . We 'll have to climb out . Yeah , or get dug out . They 're getting closer . Captain , there is another way . Uh , Captain said to stay put ? I just wanna see what 's happening . We 're cornered , outgunned . It 's only a matter of time before they find us- - what 's left of us . - Let 's not wait for that to happen . - What are you saying ? I 'm saying we make good on what we said we were gonna do . Let 's call them ... fly out of this canyon , let ' em board . - Give ourselves up . - It 's our only choice . We let these men board , we 're taking an awful chance . - These boys ain 't playing , Preacher . - I 'm aware of that . That one was really close . That tears it . I 'm with the preacher . I ain 't gettin ' snowed in permanent ... on account of somejackass kid . It 's the only option , Captain . Wash , call the cops . Tell ' em we give up . No , thank you . Tracey , what are you doing ? I said , " No . " Those bastards up there are wantin to yank out this million-credit meat ... and leave me bleedin ' . Now , turn off that radio . Rotten twerp 's gonna get us killed . Oh , don 't you move ! Don 't anybody move ! All right . We need to power up . We need to run . Now ! - Put that thing down , boy . You have no idea- - - Aw , shut it , Shepherd ! Or I swear to your God , I will shoot you dead if you do not . Sarge , Zoe , what are you doing with this Bible-thumper ? Wash , call the cops . - But- - - I 'll kill him . I 'll put a hole right through him . You mailed your ugly business to Zoe and me , Tracey . Cash on delivery . I 'll go to hell before I watch you turn and bite us for the favor . Wash , call ' em up . Tell them we 'll meet ' em topside . No , thank you ! Do it . No ! - Y-You shot me . - Damn right . - That 's enough shooting . - Wash ! - Ow . - Everybody calm down . Kaylee , get outta there ! - Oh ! - You 're a rabbit , Mal ! Yep , yep , yep , yep . Hurry , hurry . I probably scared you back there a little bit , didn 't I ? Did you see the look on his face ? It was great . You 're really bleeding ' . - Yep . They shot me . - W-Why ? Because they w- - They wanna sell me off . You won 't let them do that , will you , Kaylee , because , you know ... I think you and I really had a moment back there . - Tracey . - You know , Kaylee , I need you to fly me outta here . - Can we take this shuttle and just go ? - I ain 't going anywhere with you . Nobody 's going anywhere , Private . Whoa ! Captain , what is going on ? Don 't make me . Far as I can see , no one 's made you do anything . You brought this on yourself . Got in over your head with those stone-cold gut-runners . Then you panicked , brought the whole mess down on all of us . - That ain 't what happened . - Ah , yes , That 's what happened . Starting to think that trail of bodies Womack was talking about- - I 'm thinking some of that trail was left by you . And you ain 't left a trail of bodies , work you do ? Hmm ? 'Cause your rep speaks elsewise . Weren 't bodies of people helping me out . And you 're helping out lots , 'cause I needed a chest wound . - That can be seen to . - Do you think I 'm stupid ? In every way possible . Do you know why I picked you and Zoe ? Because you 're saps . You reppin ' out as stone killers ... but I still remember the old sarge ... with his stories and his homilies of glory and honor . - Maybe you should have listened . - Yeah ? Well , what are you now ? What are we now , Mal ? See there ? You hear that quiet ? Means the call 's already been made . Well , that call- - that call means you just murdered me . No , son . You murdered yourself . I just carried the bullet a while . Well , now ... somebody left the dog off the leash . I 've been shot too many times to be scared by a gun , boy . Womack , I think I broke your junk . Little problem during shipping . Don 't think I have to tell you folk the kinda trouble you 're in . Wetware smuggling ... resisting , fleeing an officer of the law . I 'm sure a search of this ship will come up with another few felonies . You won 't be searching the ship , Womack . - That so ? - It is . You won 't be taking us in , nor the boy who 's dying up there . I 'm authorized to kill as I like ... shepherds notwithstanding . Why is it you didn 't call in for backup ? There 's a fed station 80 miles from where you 're standing . You got your command stripes at the Silver Hold colonies . Puts you about eight sectors away from your jurisdiction . Since you 're running this job on the side ... you took pains to keep your presence here a secret . I don 't imagine it would bother anyone ... if we laid your bodies to rest at the bottom of one of these canyons . It 's damaged goods anyhow . That hat makes you look like an idiot . So , that was the plan ? That was , uh- - That was a good plan . I think so . Um , you- - You weren 't that far off about me being stupid and I- - I never could get my life working right ... not once after the war . Kaylee , um , I 'm so sorry . I- - I didn 't- - - Sarge . - Right here . Um ... you- - that stupid message of mine ... and I was trying to play you guys . And now- - You 'll- - You 'll do it ? You 'll- - You 'll get me home ? Yeah . Yeah . You know the old saying . When you can 't run , you crawl ... and when you can 't crawl , you- - when you can 't do that- - You find someone to carry you . You know , it 's funny . We went to the war never looking to come back . but it 's the real world I couldn 't survive . You two carried me through that war ... and now I need you to carry me just a little bit further ... if you can . Tell my folks I wanted to do right by them ... and that I 'm at peace and all . When you can 't run anymore , you crawl , and when you can 't do that , well- - Yeah , you know the rest . Grr ! Arrgh !

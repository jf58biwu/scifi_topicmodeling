 You care for a game ? Belongs to Crichton , but he 's not on board at the moment . Do you know how to play ? And this ... Hmm . Porn . I figure a relationship is based on trust . I didn 't want to tell you about the pregnancy until I was sure . What 's he doing here ? What does he want ? He wants asylum . Crichton . You 've gotta try these . Crichton . What ? You 're doing it again . What ? Zoning . No , no , I was just thinking . Well , the Aeryn in your head can wait . Come on . Come play these games with me . Games ? Looks like some kinda sick root . It 's organic matrix . Reality games . Simulations . Press the flesh . Ah . Sikozu , if you were to open the door we could play properly . Chiana ? Pip ! You know you 're completely vulnerable . Pilot . Moya . Hey , where are you guys ? I need to get a fix on your position . Crichton . Yo , D. How you doing , man ? Crichton , where are you ? You have got to see this . Tell him about Scorpius . - Not right now , Chiana . Crichton , we 're having a small problem with Scorpius . You have got to try this one . Hang on a sec . What the hell ? Hey , wait . This way ! You have to hurry ! Gilina . Come on , we gotta hurry ! Come on ! Whoa ! This is just a game , right ? Drad , huh ? Bring back memories ? Gilina , Scorpius , Gammak Base . I 'll save you ! Stark ? Now , this is ... This is weird . Not right . We shouldn 't just ... we shouldn 't just switch levels like that . No , no , no , I mean somebody 's messing with us . Well , I 'm sure there 's some really good techno-babble ... You know what ? Screw the explanation , Chiana . We got a problem with Scorpy on Moya and Pods do not fly themselves . We need out . Help ! Help ! Help . Cool . Now I know somebody 's messing with us . We gotta end this now . Just say you want out . I want out . Yep . That 's standard override . Try again . I want ... out . I ... want ... out ! My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . Three years ago I got shot through a wormhole . I 'm in a distant part of the universe aboard this living ship of escaped prisoners , my friends . I 've made enemies . Powerful , dangerous . Now all I want is to find a way home to warn Earth . Look upward and share the wonders I 've seen . Hey . Ouch . Hey , you okay ? Anyone home ? What happened ? I 'm not sure . Something 's gone fekkik up . Damn , that hurt . But I wouldn 't ... I wouldn 't try and move that . Yeah . Might make things worse . Oh , my God . How ... Stark . Stark ? You 're here ? I 'm supposed to be here . I am everywhere . I am Stark . Avatar . Guide . The game embodied . You 're the Avatar ? What are you doing here ? All players are supposed to begin at the Gammak base . Pip ? What do you want me to do ? The auto-out didn 't work . Oh , dear . Oh , dear ? You say you were on a Transport Pod , alone ? Mmm . Just you two ? That 's not very smart . Right . So we 'd like out now , please . I 'm afraid it 's not that easy . Could be broken . Okay , Stark . Some questions . Who 's the designer of the game ? Yoti . - Neural Template ? Yours truly , and an infusion of the dead John Crichton 's memories . Excuse me , you stole my memories ? Yeah . You appear to have backdoored into a part of the game that technically speaking , shouldn 't even exist . So , you 're kind of stuck , I think . Chiana . Scorpius . Oh , stop being such a welnitz . Brain damage and death is ... Brain damage ? ! - It 's very rare . It 's very rare . - Wel-wel-welcome . My name is John Crichton-Crichton , the most notorious criminal in the known universe . - Aghh ! Too general . - I need the manual . I may look Sebacean , but I 'm not-not-not . Billions upon b-b-billions upon billions of lives hang in the b-b-balance hang in the b-b-balance I may look Sebeacean ... hang in the b-b-balance . Your mission , should you choose to accept it ... Journey to the source of evil-evil . Discover the darkness . I 'm gonna kill Stark . Discover the darkness . Erp , erp , have a good day . Ha . Manual . Ah , specifications , specifications . Ah . Here we are . In farthest space , beyond the knowing charts , the horrid human and his band appear . And though they play today at different parts , the core of subtle truth beneath is clear . The path of choice may draw you dark and deep , where flesh deformed doth keep the dream alive . And if the way your compass cannot keep , some pearls of wisdom to thee do I give . Ha ! This should do it . Your quest is for the princess fair to seek . The one a human 's fleeting love did rend . Bring forth the sword and through the darkness peek , One loving kiss amends and there 's an end , and if we shades with taste do not agree , a door of green shall set your senses free . That was great . What was that ? Your way out . Kiss the princess . Kiss a princess ? The princess , and you 're out . Or find a green door . Either way . Vouchers . Each one good for one answer to one question . Squeeze them hard . Use them well . Time 's up . Game 's on . Good luck . Have fun . The tower 's up , but up is down . Follow the path through the fairy town . I have some questions . Path ? Up is down . Start looking . Kiss the princess . You gotta like that . I have a list of reasons why I ain 't gonna like any of this . Would you call that a path ? These things look like chocolate coins . Frell me ! That 's a path . Hey , what happens if I die in here ? Uh , game death resets on the current level . Yeah , unless normal operation is suspended . You see a green door ? What do you suppose is in there ? With our luck ? Maldis . Hey there . Oh . Relax , together . I am Pa 'u Zotoh Zhaan , tenth level Delvian priest , blood kin to the piezor who bit Scorpy 's ass . And you , and you , you 're invading my parking space . Now , frell off . - Hey , wait , wh-where ... I know who you are . You 're a couple of pilgrims on some damn fool quest . Hey , he 's hurt . He 's hurt ? Yeah . Well , he 's gonna be more hurt if he tries to kiss the princess . The Ogre 'll get him . O - Ogre ? Ah ! Be still . It 's gonna hurt . A lot . He doesn 't look so good . Yup , he 's bad . He 's going south . Oh ! It 's milking ' time , baby . Hamman side looma for the cure . Oh ! Thank you . Yeah . Better get ready to keep him quiet . The Ogre is not gonna let you kiss her , you know . He 'll be jealous . Feed him , you fannik . Okay . Here 's the good stuff . Here it is . Oh ... Frell ! Acid . Okay , try the other looma . Very good , little nixar . Most get burnt the first time . Okay , here we go . Other looma . Next time lucky . Unless the Ogre gets wind of this , then there 'll be trouble . Okay , here 's my boy . Keep it down . Keep it down . Oh ... Oh ... This is bad ! Ooh , he had to hear that ! - Fe fi fo fum ! - Buckle up , buckle up ! Who had to hear ? ! The Big Kahuna ! It 's the Ogre ! It 's him ! Get him out ! Get him out ! I don 't wanna go ... Zhaan . Yeah . Oh , the horror . The new and improved Zhaan . How ya feelin ? Fruity . If you say so . You have to , Crichton . Or these games will eat you up . All right , I 'll try . - Just give it a go . Give it a go . Look , I said I 'll ... Whoa . None shall pass . Check this out . Brave sir knight ! I am King Arthur of Camelot . This is my loyal vassal , Patsy . Bollocks ! You 're a pimped-out , arrogant fleshie who wants to use my road where none shall pass . Right . Well , that went great . Let 's kill him . No , no , he 's not gonna move too fast , lugging all that armor . We can just go around . None ... shall ... pass ! Okay . Whoa ! Whoa ! I thought you said this way ! I changed my mind ! Huh ? Whoa . Hey , Pip . You see a path ? No . No , I don 't . I said to wait but no , you wanna play games while Scorpy is on the ship ! Not to mention the potential brain damage , Chiana ! A green door . We need a green door . Just ... just ask . Voucher . Voucher . One question , one answer . Warm tonight , or is it just me ? - Stark , we want out . The tower 's up but up is down . Follow the path through the fairy town . Later ! Stark , you get your ass back here now or I 'm gonna come kick your lily white ... That 's it . What are you doin ' ? Follow the path . The path ends here . Hey ... Okay , what are you doing here ? Hey , Gretel . You think they 're here to eat ? Uh , we 're just passing through ? The Princess . Please ! The Ogre 's gonna have my hide if I let you go without some molestation . - Frell you , Hansel ! - Why is it never my turn ? Hey look , we ... we ... we don t wanna kiss the princess . We just want that ... that green door there . - Please , eat me ! It 's my turn ! Eat me ! Please , kill me ! It 's my turn ! Shut up ! Okay . So you want out ? No princess , no tastes , no , uh ... Now , this is too easy . She tastes great . Ah , she tastes real great . - Please , eat me . Yummy , yummy . Go on . Yummy , yummy . Don 't go . Eat me . That 's it ! That 's it . Go to the door . Damn ! Way too long in that thing . Pip , come on . Pilot ? Aeryn ? D 'Argo ? Crichton , where the frell are you ? Oh , just trying to get home , Auntie Em . Hey , you guys got a problem ? Scorpius . Just do not tell me that he has escaped . He has . And there 's a Command Carrier on the way . D 'Argo , how the hell did that happen ? ! Still working on that . We 've got lots of bugs in Moya 's systems . Oh , great . Well , what does Sikozu say about that ? Haven 't heard from her since the escape . But Pilot 's losing control of critical systems . Right , right , right . We will be there ASAP . Chiana , dammit , wake up ! All right . All right , how the hell does this thing come off ? Where 's Chiana ? Ah , she 's too bony . Probably tastes like fish . You don 't wanna eat her . The bloody bitch bites . What am I , chopped liver ? ! I do not have time for this . How come nobody ever wants to eat me ? ! In here ! Where ? In here ! Back so soon ? And I thought you didn 't like us . Where 's Chiana ? Could you be more specific ? Little grey girl . A sword and a floppy hat . Girl of grey with swords at play . Girl of grey went that a way . Wait for it ! Mind the gap . Eenie , meenie ... Floor , please . - ... me . Where the grey girl went . Oh-oh-oh-oh ... the penthouse . Mmm . Do you have an appointment ? You know , this would be vaguely amusing if I wasn 't in a hurry . It 's your funeral . So-so-so what-what brings you here ? Business ? Pleasure ? Hmm ... That 's a nice sword you 've got . Ever slay any dragons with it ? You should give it a name . How about Cameron or Uma-Uma-Uma ? First floor-first floor , little lost girls . Have a good day . Whoa ! Yes , I know . This elevator sucks . My job su-su-su-sucks . Day after day , the same-same thing . Up . Down . Up . Down . Down . Just once-just once , it 'd be nice to go sideways . Just-just sideways . Frog Princes ! Not-not that I plan on doing this forever-ever . I have plans , you know . Big plans . I - I 'm studying to be an astronaut . And , penthouse . Have a good day . I knew it . I knew it had to be you ! Ma 'am ! A visitor . Yes , I can see that . I 'm so sorry , Ma 'am . I didn 't realize you were expecting other guests . That 's all right , Harvey . Would you let the master know that we have a gentleman caller ? He 's not the Ogre ? What , Harvey ? Oh heavens no . He 's just an incorrigible liar . And the butler . So , can I help you find someplace to sheathe that sword ? No , where 's , uh ... The grey girl ? Don 't you worry about her . My beast of a boyfriend is showing her around the place . Can I get you a drink ? No . - Oh , don 't be like that . You must be parched from coming all this way . I only want Chiana . Oh now , we both know that 's not true . Honey ! We 're out of ice . Steady on there , meat . We just finished redecorating the last bloodbath we had in here . It 's a little joke . So . You here to kiss the missus ? Why do you have to be such a monster ? At least I don 't spend my days redecorating . What is it with women and change ? ! Seems like nothing is ever good enough . Oh ! You have to save me from him ! Please ! You have to save me ! - Chiana ! Hey ! - What the hell have you been doing ? We have a problem on the ship . We have to go ! - Okay . See ? Every time we meet someone nice , you scare them away . Something wrong ? - You scare them away ! Of course , as usual . Now let 's go ! Frell . D ! Rally the troops , we 're coming in . What took you so long ? Weird detour . Pilot 's blind on the hamman side , Tiers Seven and Eleven . DRD 's are searching there . It 's likely Scorpius is hiding in those blind spots . The plan is , we hunt him down . Like that plan . Aeryn and John you take Tier Seven . - Okay . And Rygel , stay where you are and stay out of trouble . This is familiar . What , the passageway ? No . It 's good to have you back . Crichton . Aeryn . He 's here ! On our way , Pilot . Seal the chamber . Locked out . D 'Argo ! Pilot ? Pip ? Crichton , I can 't find D 'Argo . Access shaft , this way . Feels like a trap . Only one way to know . Pilot ? You all right ? Everything is finally under control . Pilot ? Not exactly , Commander . Have you ever heard of a neural harness ? Your Pilot 's mind is now slave to my own . John . - Whatever happens to the master ... happens to the slave . If I die , so does your Pilot . Grayza 's Command Carrier is on the way . He 's a pathological liar . Our odds are not going to get any better . Feeling lucky ? Aeryn ? He 's awake . He did it , didn 't he ? Tagged you with a microchip ? You haven 't considered the possibility that I was protecting Pilot . The second boot to the head convinced me otherwise . She 's special , don 't you think ? You son of a bitch . Shall we end this ? You resisted the Aurora Chair . You 've resisted my neural clone and , uh , you resist all reason . You 're starting to sound like Sikozu . Perhaps . Where does that leave us , John ? Time you headed off for darker pastures and left me the hell alone . You resist because you have hope . Hope that your friends will save you . This time it will be different . One by one , I will extinguish all your hopes and little by little you will begin to see reason . Scorpius . We have Rygel . Lovely girl . I hear that one quarter Scarran-Sebacean offspring are quite handsome . You harm me , you harm her . Psst . Hey . Crichton . Down here . I 've got the game . Chiana ! Shh . They 're sleeping . Okay . I don 't wanna have to deal with them now . Okay , Scorpius has got control over the whole of the ship . He 's got D 'Argo and Rygel , everybody . He can hear everything . Not in here . Right . We can 't kill the son of a bitch without hurting the others . Whatever happens to him happens to everybody he controls . So leave me the game blob thingy . When I take him down , you have to find a way to hog tie everybody . So you 're gonna draw Scorpius into the game ? What are you doing ? Working on what your master wants . So you still think that he controls me . Does he ? Look , the only thing that keeps you alive is the secret you hold . And the same is true for me . He 's hearing all this , you know . I know . I should never have let you go . Most of this floor you should recognize . It 's an equation describing the behavior of wormholes . What it lacks is the single unifying symbol . That symbol is beneath my left foot . Would you like to see it ? You would give it to me ? I want you to take it . Your species has brutal flair . Anyone else enters this room , I can spill enough blood to erase the entire equation . Very well . You know if you kill me ... Oh , I don 't think that 's going happen , not after all you 've survived . Then again , I could get lucky . Oh , crap . I wasn 't ... Quick , this way . He 's not supposed to come from that direction . Really , John ? You expect to hold me in a simulation ? Seemed like a good idea at the time . This world means nothing to me . I see through it 's very existence . John ! Please ! - Allow me to show you what I see . Having trouble breathing ? I wonder if you die now , whether your mind will carry the wormhole knowledge with it , into the game . Relax , John . Soon it 'll be over . He was killing you . I couldn 't let that happen . We have to get out of here before he comes out . Come on . What about the others ? We can 't save the others . Listen . John , I came back for you . Nothing else matters , I just ... want to be with you . Now let 's get out of here before it 's too late . Something 's wrong . Something 's wrong . Does this mean it 's over ? Chiana ! What 's wrong ? Everything . We 're still in the game . No . We never left . Moya is part of the game . They changed the doors . Figured it out , have we ? Stark ! What the hell is this about ? This is all about you , John Crichton . You 're far too sick to be allowed to run free in the universe . When you die on the outside , your mind will live on . Here , with us . Welcome home , John . How the hell do we get out of this game ? - I don 't know . Then this better work . - Okay . Careful . It 's your last one . What the hell 's the endgame ? One hero 's sword to set her free-free-free , one kiss upon her lips so sweet , thus ends your quest , thus ends the game-game , and thus your soul is saved . Oh , we already heard that . - Yeah , I know that . But finding a door out may be impossible . If we die , it only resets a level . One sure way out , we achieve the endgame . We 're gonna kiss the princess . Run , run , run , as fast as you can . Float like a budong . Not in the face ! Bastard wants us to play , let 's give him what he wants . That hurt , John . Stark . Ha . So how 'd you do it ? Who helped ? You did . You and that tragic brother , pouring his heart out on his death bed . Bull . This game has crap he couldn 't know . It 's crap you gave me along the way . You talk so much . Oh , God , no Sikozu , no Noranti . Very good . Damn , I guess that leaves one question . Plants . Why do they love the light ? Oh ... John . Oh ! Ha . None shall pass . Where is he ? What are they doing here ? It 's my turn ! You are disturbing my meal . Chiana ? - Yeah ? Does this room seem too easy ? - What do you mean ? I mean , first time here . How did you make it through ? Uh ... Chiana , what 's Aeryn 's secret ? What ? Aeryn 's secret . What about me ? ! Hey . - Huh ? Eat this . Aeryn 's pregnant . Frell , Crichton ! You left me there for arns ! I could 've died . Sorry about that . What is it with women and change ? You-You-You really are John Crichton . Can I get an autograph ? Master . We have guests . I 'm here for the princess . I can see that . So romantic . You up for this ? Could be fun . Let 's screw the pooch . I 'm all about fun . Hurrah . Game on . I learned this on TV . I 'm not gonna clean up . - Ooh ! Come on , Harvey . - Stop fighting ' like a girl ! You need more practice , meat ! I 'll make a note . Oh , good . I can see who wears the pants in your family . Redecoratin ' . Blood everywhere ! She just killed you . Honey , the butler 's dead . Hey , Pip ... - Yeah ? Little help ! - Frell . That 's it , finish him off . Two against one ! Looks like I won 't be having that drink , after all ! He 's mine . How am I doin ' ? Coming back for you . I hope so . Oh , child ! Well , she 's done it now . Women ! Go on . Are you really John Crichton ? Yeah . We are gonna be so happy together . Chiana ? Uh ... I don 't know . What do you mean , you don 't know ? I don 't know . Hey , I know . Maybe you have to do more than just kiss her . Maybe " kiss " is a metaphor for showing her a really good time . Mmm . Yeah , and maybe Chiana has to kiss her . Huh ? Can I watch ? I love to watch . She is not the princess . What ? Oh . Well , I 'm not the princess you seek , but we could still have a really good time . This is my world , meat ! You 're just walking through it for a very long time . When your body is dead , your mind will live here , with us , to strut and fret forever . You poor player . Crichton ? Game reset . What are you doing , John do-do-doing , John ? Your world , your princess . Princess , princess , pr-princess . One-One pr-princess fair , her bro-broken heart by ug-ugliness enslaved , ug-ugliness-ugliness enslaved . Ugliness enslaved . John , we can work this out . One hero 's sword to set her free . - Don 't touch her ! - She 's mine ! Mine ! Be silent , Stark . Is that really you , John Crichton ? I think , yeah . And you 're ... Zhaan . For all that matters . This Stark wishes to keep you here . He blames you . No . Believes I died for the love of you . A lot of people have died because of me . What is it that you wish of me , John Crichton ? A kiss . Have you wasted my death , and the deaths of so many others ? I don 't know . Then I suggest you find out , before anyone else dies for the love of you . No . Son of a bitch ! D ! D 'Argo ! John , where are you ? Uh ... I 'm not entirely sure right now . What 's up with Scorpius ? We had a small problem with his door , but that 's already sorted . You 're long overdue . Is everything okay ? Hey , hey , we 're not dead . How drad is that ? Mmm . Interesting day ? They 're all interesting . This was more like ... confusing . And a warrior needs clarity . I 'm not a warrior . You carry a weapon . Second Amendment . Besides , it 's Scorpy 's war , not mine . Thousands dead , billions in the balance . But that 's not the war I 'm speaking of . Aeryn . The war of the heart . Always Aeryn . Yeah , I don 't ... think too clear where Aeryn is concerned . Pain clouds judgment . Distillate of Laka . One whiff , and the pain is gone , for a time . It 'll help you forget about Aeryn . Oh , and please don 't thank me . It 's been 150 cycles since I 've ... since I 've felt for someone the way you do for her . Hmm . I hear I was a princess .

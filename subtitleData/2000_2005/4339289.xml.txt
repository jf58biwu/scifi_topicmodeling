 Futurama [ 5x02 ] - Jurassic Bark - CiWaN For my next trick , notice I have nothing up my sleeves ... And nothing in my head . So if my lovely assistant will kindly supply me ... With an ordinary , non-Fake pitcher of milk . Behold ! The milk has vanished ! Exiled , perhaps , to another dimension ! Amazing ! That 's why they call you Bender the Magnificent . No , it isn 't . They discovered an intact 20th-Century pizzeria , like the one I used to work at ! Interesting . No , wait , the other thing . Tedious . Let 's check it out . You can see how I lived before I met you . You lived before you met me ? Sure . Lots of people did . Really . Truly , they were as gods who built this place . Next , we come to the splendidly preserved wooden pizza paddle . Scientists theorize it was used to gently discipline the delivery boy . Wait a second . This is Panucci 's ! I used to work in this exact pizzeria . And for your information , lady , this was not just used to paddle my butt . It was also used to move pizzas and crush rats . I don 't know where you get your facts , sir ... But I am a volunteer housewife with 45 minutes of orientation ... And a Harlequin romance about archeologists . Don 't wave your fancy degrees at me . I recognize all this stuff . Petrified sausages , old Mr. Vitelli , and that 's- - Yes ? Pizza delivery for Mr. Seymour Asses ? There 's no one by that name here or anywhere . I hope that in time you 'll realize what an idiot you 've been . I wouldn 't count on that . Poor little guy . You look like you haven 't eaten in a month . Here . But if Mr. Panucci asks , your name is Seymour Asses . I like you , Seymour . You 're not constantly judging me , like all the other dogs . Are you ? We understand each other . People think you 're just a mutt who smells bad ... Can 't find a girlfriend and has a crummy job . But you 're keeping it real and you call no man " Mister . " Well , goodbye . Live long and prosper . That 's the least appetizing calzone I 've ever seen . No ! That 's my dog in there ! It 's an outrage , I say . Ow ! Ow ! I 'm taking him home and I 'd like to see anyone try and stop me . Ow ! Oh ! Ow ! Oh ! Ah ! And then he was ejected by the guards . Needless to say , I was mortified . Well , it 's not right to make my dead pet an exhibit . That 's like digging up Lassie and putting her in the Louvre . Lassie is on display in the Louvre . I know . I was deliberately describing a similar situation . Why don 't you try protesting , like those native Martians . Always whining that people don 't treat their ancestors ' bones with respect . Protesting never works . You 're right . I 'll give it a shot ! What do you want ? Fry 's dog ! When do you want it ? Fry 's dog ! Yeah ! I will now perform my people 's native dance . It says here that this part of The Hustle ... Implores the gods to grant a favor , usually a Trans Am . Thattaboy , Seymour . Right here waiting for me as always . Just like that huge mushroom in my shower . Hey , there 's our little mascot . You been swimming in the sewer again ? You rascal . Fry , cleanup ! Seymour , cleanup ! Good dog . That 's a good Seymour . There 's dog fur on my slice ! No , that 's vermicelli . No fur in here . He 's so cute . He can do two things at one time : eat and swim . Three things ! Fry , it 's been three days . You can 't keep boogying like this . You 'll come down with a fever of some sort . I 'm Dr. Ben Beeler , the paleontologist who discovered your dog . Or as some call it , the Beelersaurus . So do I get Seymour back ? Are you caving to political pressure ? No . We 're sorry , but there 's just too much ... That fossil can teach us about dogs from your time . His name was Seymour . He was once intimate with the leg of a wandering saxophonist . He had wet dog smell , even when dry . And he was not above chasing the number 29 bus . The 29 ? Lnteresting . That 's all I needed , right ? I 'm good . Okay , then . Here 's your dog back . Seymour ! Lady and gentleman ... How about a hand for my temporary replacement assistant ? I was all in this part ! It 's magic ! You 're not fit to wear Fry 's leotard ! Stop ! Good news , everyone ! Hurray , he 's back ! And he 's looking for a garbage can to put the rock in . Here you go , buddy . No . Actually , we 've discovered that Fry 's dog was fast-Fossilized ... Preserving its cellular structure . Which means we can clone it ! Seymour will live again ! A little land mammal . Can you believe it , Bender ? I 'm gonna have my best friend back ! Why the idiot convention ? Cubert , my precious babe . I 'm going to attempt to clone Fry 's dog ... Using the very same apparatus I used to clone you . Look ! There 's a smidge of toe still in here . You see , beneath the fossil 's crunchy mineral shell ... There 's still a creamy core of dog nougat . So will Seymour remember how to sing " Walking on Sunshine " ? Amazingly , yes . In cases of rapid fossilization , I can press this brain scan button ... Retrieving Seymour 's memories at the precise instant of doggy death . I 'm gonna get my puppy back ! Ln your face , Grim Reaper ! Crappy , ineffective reaper . I just need to reset the Clone-O-Mat from human mode to dog mode . The dog says : Oh-Oh . This may take a while . You stink , loser ! Hey , Fry , pizza going out . Come on ! But I 'm celebrating New Year 's Eve . Like you got squat to celebrate . You 're a delivery boy this millennium ... And you 'll be a delivery boy next millennium . What 's with Seymour ? It 's like he don 't want you to go . Or he thinks your pants is too short . Which is crazy , because frankly , you look fabulous . Now get going ! I won 't be gone long , Seymour . Just wait here till I come back . Hello ? Pizza delivery for ... " I.C. Wiener " ? Oh , crud . Here 's to another lousy millennium . Five , four , three , two . What the- - ? A dog collar , for me ? You shouldn 't have . That 's for Seymour . Oh . A subscription to the Daily Growl ? That 's not a reputable journal of opinion . That 's for Seymour . I 'm getting everything ready for when he 's cloned . Are you on the junk , Fry ? Why waste time on a creature of inferior intelligence ? Hey , he was smart . He could fetch . I can fetch ! He could dig up bones . Hello ? Charlemagne ? Plus , I bet he couldn 't create a laser show with his head . Look , Bender , this has nothing to do with you . That 's impossible ! Now if you 'll excuse me , I 'm working on Seymour 's doghouse . No one ever asked if Bender would like to live in a tiny little house . Not that I would . A tiny little house that says " Bender " on it . Ow ! This is Fry . If you 're calling about the used towels for sale ... They 're still available for $ 45 each . Phil , it 's your father . Where are you ? You 're holding up New Year 's brunch . Your brother can 't wait any longer . Hello , first bologna of the new millennium . Here he comes . That 's him and Seymour . Well , that 's weird . Seymour 's here , but- - Go ! Go ! Touchdown ! But where 's Philip ? I 'm telling you , the Y2K computers got him . We 'll face burning roads , rivers exploding ... Calculators transformed into Scud missiles . There 's nothing we can do . What 's that , Seymour ? You walking on sunshine ? He 's trying to tell us something . Maybe he can lead us to Philip ! Should we follow him ? To our deaths ? Negatory . It 's the Y2K trying to lure us into an ambush . And I ain 't buying it . Pass the bologna . Are you gonna be done soon ? Sorry , but we need to practice hand-To-Hand combat ... In case an enemy knocks the laser guns out of our hands ... And they slide way across the room . Could you do it someplace else ? I 'm setting up Seymour 's dog bed . Okay . Ow ! Heel , boy ! Heel ! Oh , hello , Fry . I guess I didn 't notice you there . I 'm having such fun with my new best friend , Robo-Puppy . That 's nice . I was just out walking him . Yes , you can walk him . Of course , after he goes , you have to refill the canisters . Come here , boy ! Pet , pet , pet . Robo-Puppy receiving petting . Bender , are you jealous of Fry 's puppy ? That 's so adorable ! Jealous ? Not when I have the love of Robo-Puppy here . Robo-Puppy , lick my cheek . Robo-Puppy preparing to lick cheek . Robo-Puppy commencing cheek licking . Licking in progress . Licking complete . Robo-Puppy truly is robot 's best friend . There . Perfect . Good news , everyone ! The Clone-O-Mat is ready ! Finally ! Robo-Puppy commencing two-Hour yipping session . Robo-Puppy mistreatment alert ! Robo-Puppy mistreatment alert ! Behold once more , the mighty Clone-O-Mat ! Requiring such vast amounts of electricity ... That we must harness the elemental power of nature itself ! Wow . I speak , of course , of molten lava deep within the Earth 's core . To the subbasement ! Powering up Clone-O-Mat ! Placing fossil on the Plat-Clone-O-Form . Initiating dog brain CAT scan ! Come on , boy . Come back to life . Know ye now what feels like to be dog god ! Commencing DNA extraction . Fry , come on ! The talent show . What ? I 'm in the middle of something . But if we don 't perform , in what sense do we have an act ? Bender , enough . Leave me alone ! So that 's how it is ? I thought you were my friend . But if you love your dog so much , maybe you 'd rather play fetch ! No ! Now I 'm all you got ! I hate you ! I hate you ! You evil , metal man ! Ow ! So anyway , your dog is melted . Now we 're friends again . Not necessarily . For the dog may yet survive . May yet ? Really ? Indeed . You see , that fossil was made of dolomite ... The tough , black mineral that won 't cop out when there 's heat all about . By contrast , observe the lava 's affect on this ice swan . Of course , that would 've melted even at room temperature . I just wanted to get rid of it . But had it been made of that righteous mineral dolomite ... There 's a slim chance it might have survived . So Seymour might still exist ? Perhaps , for a few minutes . It 's dolomite , baby ! Then I 'm going in after him ! No ! He 'd come after me ! Acting like a moron won 't bring your dog back . Then all hope is lost ! Goodbye , Seymour . Please stop crying , Fry . Here . I assumed you were just pretending to love the dog ... To toy with my emotions . What have I done ? You didn 't do anything . Don 't beat yourself up . Fry , I 'm sorry . I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature ... Because I love you . Not in the way of the ancient Greeks , but the way a robot loves a human ... A human loves a dog , and occasionally , a gorilla loves a kitty . I 'm going in ! I 'm a professor ! Why isn 't anyone listening to me ? You can 't go in because you 'll melt ! The fossil only has a chance because it 's made of dolomite . I 'm 40 percent dolomite ! Oh , it 's hot . Oh , it 's very hot ! I am one hung-Over cryogenicist . Throw that mutt in the freezer till his owners come . You can 't solve all your problems by freezing them . I think you 're forgetting our motto . Are you the cryogenicist who called about our son 's dog ? You must be the Frys . Yeah , he 's right over there . Sorry we 're late . We all got sick from eating bad bologna . Y2K . What 's he so worked up about ? He 's just upset because our boy 's missing . Come on , you overgrown rat ! Lead us to Philip . Bender 's been down there too long ! I 'm going in after him ! Professor ! Lava ! Hot ! This is all my fault . I let my best friend risk his life just to get my dead dog back . Bender ! And that is why they call me ... Bender the Magnificent ! Hey , where 'd everybody go ? Okay , let 's clone us some dog . Yeah ! Very well . Let this abomination unto the Lord begin ! Interesting . It seems Seymour died at the ripe old age of 15 . Fifteen ? You mean he lived for 12 more years after I got frozen ? Indeed . Stop the cloning . Oh , sure . Smash the smart guy 's machine . Fry , what 's wrong ? Think about it . Seymour lived a full life after I was gone . He probably even added new songs to his repertoire . But that 's a good thing . " Walking on Sunshine " sucks noodles . I had Seymour till he was 3 . That 's when I knew him and that 's when I loved him . I 'll never forget him . But he forgot me a long , long time ago . Ow !

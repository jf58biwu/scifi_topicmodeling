 To classify all the bodies In the solar system It is necessary ... to adopt an arbitrary set of criteria ; a criteria ... which must also apply to the minor planets , or asteroids . Let us now look at the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter . The classification of this group of fragmented planetlsmals began In ... 1801 with the discovery of Ceres . Ceres , having a diameter of 955 kilometers ... Is found to be the largest member of several hundred sizable boulders ... locked In what would seem to be a merry-go-round of primordial debris ... from a very early phase of planetary formation . Out of overtwo thousand asteroids regularly charted and observed ... Ceres , due to its large size , convenient location and availability ... was found to be the perfect spot for a drinking establishment ... or bar If you wlll . It was named , appropriately enough , " The Ceres Crossroads " . And It was more often than not , frequented by roughnecks ... and thugs . It Is here where our story began . The story of how I became a father . And oh yeah , it 's my birthday . Shit Ceres Crossroads . Eddy speaking . Eddy , Samuei Curtis . I just landed ... I know . We saw lt . It was great . Can you dig me out and set me up for flight ? Sure . Dld you bring the cat ? Yeah . I got him . His name is Monkey Puss . I want to name him Oscar . That wasn 't so bad . Was it , Monkey ? Eddy , you got something for me , right ? Oh , yeah . Okay . I 'll be in in a bit . Okay . Good-bye . All right , cat , let 's go . I 'm keeping that with me . You seen Eddy ? Yes . He 's right overthere by the corner of the bar . You mean the bartender ? Thanks . Samuei Curtis . I know . We watched you land . Everybody here got just the biggest ... charge out of it . I 'm still buzzin ' . In fact , everybody 's buzzin ' . You got something for me , right ? You 're not going to believe what i got for you . No one can come back here but me , so we can keep Oscar here ' till they come and get him . I thought he was for you . Oh , no . I hate cats , but you sure saved my butt bringing him here . - You 're staying , right ? - What is that ? You 're staying forthe big dance , aren 't you ? Yeah , sure . I don 't get it . It 's a girl . It 's a real live girl . What am i supposed to do with it ? I don 't know . Who 's playing at the dance tonight ? Me . I guess i 'll see you there . Mind if i use your bathroom ? Sure . It 's a real toilet so be careful . Thanks , Eddy . That 's him . Hey Boy-Hey Boy ... i got a message for you ... about a thing called love and the stars above . And a little white dove , sends push turn to shove to fist to cuffs . Things really got rough . But enough 's enough . Hey Boy-Hey Boy ... i heard it from a friend about you ... about your hatred when you 're laying in your bed ... and your facing the tread with your hatred fed ... from the things you said . And you wish you were dead ... because you 're separated from a thing called love . And the stars above . And a little white dove sends push turn to shove to fist to cuffs Things really got rough . But enough 's enough Hey Boy-Hey Boy ... i heard it from a friend about you ... that you 're heart broken and your anger 's smoking . And you lie there poking at a little token ... of days gone by . You let out a sigh . Tears fill your eyes . And you start to cry . And say , Oh God why . And you wish you could die . And your eyes won 't dry . And time don 't fly on this hellish night . Eyes wide open on this hellish ride as you go switching from side to side because you 're filled with hatred ... when you 're lying in your bed . And your face turns red ... with your hatred fed from the things you said . And you wish you were dead ... because you 're separated from a thing called love . And the stars above ... and a little white dove sends push turn to shove to fist to cuffs . Things really got rough . But enough 's enough ! Hey Boy-Hey Boy ... i heard it from a friend about you ... Hey ! Hey ! You son of a bitch ! Hey ! Hey ! Did you just see two guys come out of that bathroom ? Here you go . Hey , is it just me , or do my balls itch ? I think it 's you . Good . For a minute , i thought my balls itched . Hey , it 's a joke . It 's funny . Fuck it . This what you 're looking for ? Larry Biueberry . My name is Lawrence . It 's never been Larry . I don 't like that name . I hear you 're doing pretty good these days . I heard you were killed by Professor Hess . Yeah , well . Apparentiy your photographers have proven otherwise . That 's the Biueberry Pirate . An interplanetary fruit thief and old dance partner of Samuei Curtis ' . Came here to pick up a cat named Oscar as payment for some stolen fruit he 'd delivered . Here 's where they get reacquainted at the bar , all nice and friendly , just like that , see ? Oid friends , that 's all . This is where the pirate gives Curtis some pictures and oh so gracefully bestows upon him ... the perfect plan for an astronaut in his position . In return Samuei Curtis agrees to be the Pirate 's partner at ... the big dance contest because Curtis didn 't have a plan and ... the Pirate neverwon anything in his whole life and those were ... The most beautiful trophies he 'd ever seen . Unquote . Curtis ' new mission is to return to Earth with the body of a man named ... Johnny R. Johnny R. Came from a very wealthy family . A family that 's willing to award a great deal of wealth forthe return of his remains . Right now his body is being preserved on Venus , the planet of beautiful women . The planet of women who can reproduce without the use of men . Unfortunateiy , if more than three generations go by without introducing new blood ... the women become high-bred and even too snippy forthemseives to stand . So it 's necessary forthem to keep a man around as a stud . The women of Venus adopt an adolescent male from a well-to-do family ... ride him like a wild stallion , treat him like a king ... and love him until the day he dies , usually at a ripe old age . And then replace him with another adolescent male . Johnny R. Had reached that ripe old age and the time had come to replace him ... but the women of Venus won 't part with his body until an adequate replacement has been delivered . The perfect replacement could be found on Jupiter . Jupiter 's a very wealthy mining planet , where infant males are taken and sold to a man ... named Lee Vllensky . They 're raised as workers and grow up to be strong men with no knowledge of women . Lee Vllensky owns Jupiter and years before he had purchased a boy ... from Samuei Curtis known as ... The Boy who actually saw a woman 's breast . Forthis brief experience the boy has been treated as a treasure . He 's become the planet 's figurehead . He 's used to boost the morale of workers by performing in great night rallies ... where he quickly and arrogantly describes what it is he had seen . Overthe years , the boy had grown up to be a strong and handsome young man ... and both the Biueberry Pirate and Samuei Curtis know that the women of Venus would go nuts for him . They also believe that Lee Vllensky would part with the boy in trade for ... the real live girl . He could raise her , marry her , have sex with her ... then describe the experience to his workers in great detail . That would be an incredible morale booster . That would create a happier , more productive work environment . So i take the girl to Jupiter ... trade her forthe boy , bring the boy to Venus ... trade him forJohnny R ... bring Johnny R. Back to earth and i get rich . That 's it . Where 'd the girl come from ? Eddy cloned her from one of his own cells . That 's one detail best left unsaid . Gentiemen , is it just me or do my balls itch ? So this guy walks into a bar and he says to the bartender ... " Can i use your phone ? " The bartender says , " Sure " . So , he wipes his ass on it and the bart ... What ? Ah shit , i just told you the punchline . I 've been telling this joke so fuckin long , i knew i 'd fuck it up . Anyway . You want to hear something really weird ? So there 's this man and he lived his whole life on Earth and his name was Mr. Stevenson . When Mr. Stevenson was eight years oid , he asked another little boy ... if he would llke a Hurts Donut . The other boy said , " Yes . " So he hit him on the arm and he said , " Hurts Donut ? " . Five years later Mr. Stevenson asked another boy about his same age at that time ... if he would llke a Hurts Donut . When the boy said , " Yes " , Mr. Stevenson stabbed him over and over again ... in his eye , in his cheek with a pencil ... saying , " Hurts Donut ? " Overthe years Mr. Stevenson did very well in school . On graduation day he was sat next to another young man , who ... like Mr. Stevenson , had earned high marks . When he asked the boy if he would llke a Hurts Donut , the boy said ... " Not if you 're going to stab me in the eye with a pencil . " " I wouldn 't even touch you , " said Mr. Stevenson . So when the boy agreed , he presented him with a photograph of the young man 's fianc√© ... at a bachelor party , on some guy 's table , fucking herself with a beer bottle . As tears filled the young man 's eyes , Mr. Stevenson was heard to say ... " Hurts Donut . " A few years later Mr. Stevenson got a job as a sales clerk in an electronics store . Within a year , he was caught stealing and immediately incarcerated . When he asked his cellmate if he would llke a Hurts Donut , his cellmate said " Yeah " So he gave him a Hurts Donut . Overthe years Mr. Stevenson grew too oid to hospital . One day he asked the new nurse if she would llke a Hurts Donut . In anticipation of her response , Mr. Stevenson began humming ... while making smacking noises with his mouth . When the nurse smiled and said , " i know about you Mr. Stevenson , " Mr. Stevenson blurted out something totally incoherent ... and began to laugh . I 've never understood this joke . But then i 've never been to Earth . All right . All right . Gentiemen , let the dance contest begin . Love is a flipping rolling riddle . Love is a smiling when you the giggle of those angels . Giggie when they know you 're smiling . Love is rotting in an open field . Love is smiling at the happy way you feel ... when you know you 're smiling . So how can you keep on smiling ... when you see yourself in the mirror smiling ? Just about to say the name of the girl that makes you smile . Love is thinking of when you die . When she hears your name mentioned ... she starts to cry . She 'll remember you smiling . Love is living in a magic land . Love is thinking ... of the day she 'll hold your hand ... And you 'll both be smiling . So how can you keep on smiling when ... you see yourself in the mirror smiling ? Just about ... to say the name of the girl that makes you cry . Let 's go . What about your boys overthere ? They 'll be sitting this one out . One , two , three , four . What did he say about me ? What did he say about me ? Who are you ? You know , you are so square . I guess that i am . So what did he say about me ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . You stand there with that trophy and you tell me you don 't know what i 'm talking about ? Excuse me . You sit at the bar and you talk and you laugh and you tell me you don 't know what i 'm talking about , huh ? - Do not touch me . Don 't touch you ? I can touch you . I can touch you whenever i want . Guess what ? It 's my birthday . Did he tell you it was my birthday ? Are you going to sing Happy Birthday to me ? I want you to sing Happy Birthday to me .

What the hell is that ? It 's a real live girl . You take this . You grow her in private . You raise her . You teach her . You marry her . All for a kid whose brief , fleeting encounter ... pales in comparison to the experiences that await you . Let 's say that i was going to show herto somebody right now ... my daughter orwife orwhateverthe hell she is . She looks bad . Why would you show herto anybody ? What if i wanted to ?

I 'm not good enough to kiss you ? Is that what you 're saying ? What do you want Professor ? Guess what today Is ? I don 't know . What ? Guess . It 's Friday , Saturday somewhere . I don 't know . It 's my birthday . Oh well , Happy Birthday . Are you going to sing Happy Birthday to me ? No . Why not ? Why aren 't you going to sing Happy Birthday to me ? I don 't like the song . You are so square . Did you call me to insult me , Professor ? You 're very important to me . I want you to hear something . Dld you hearthat ? No . It was a cat purring .

But if you see any big pictures of me don 't tell anyone that you know me . It 's a deal . No . No , you don 't have to see any big pictures of me ... because I 'm going to catch up with you ... And then we 're going to have a birthday party . I guess i 'll see you then . A friend ? A question to which yes or no would not quite suffice . Does he call a lot ? No . He disappears for long stretches of time . Then he finds me ... kills everyone i come in contact with ... and tries to forgive me . When he does that he 's going to kill me . Do you like him ? Yeah . He 's like family . And when he forgives you , he 's going to kill you ? That 's the kind of guy he is . What kind of guy is he ? He 's a Birthday Boy . He kills without reason . If he has no reason to kill you , then he can kill you . But if he has a reason to kill you then he 's got a problem . And if he kills you without resolving that problem , then ... you 'd be dead and the problem would live on forever unresolved . That doesn 't make any sense . Yeah , it does . What did you do that was so hard to forgive ? Well ... i 'll tell you . Hey , i think i see a barn up ahead . We 'll hide our spaceship in the barn . What if there 's something in there ? How do ? Nice ... nice cabin in the sky you 've got here . Well , hell . Why don 't you take off your boots and float around ? Where you from ? We 're Earth people . Yeah . Where about ? Sllver State of Nevada . How about yourself ? Yeah , i 'm from there , but i moved around a lot . What about the boy here ? Is he your son ? No , i 'm just giving him a ride to Venus . Yeah ? What happened ? Their King die or something ? Yeah . Son of a bitch . How old are you , kid ? Fifteen . Son of a bitch . We got a little bastard about your age . How 'd you like to go kick his ass ? No , thank you . What are you scared ? He 's got candy bars and cigarettes back there . Now go kick the shit out of him . Ah , it don 't make no difference . Littie fuckers ' going to kill us all . Who 's the kid ? He ain 't got no real name . We call him Bodysuit . Raised him so he could go back to earth to find out more about the chart . But he ain 't worth a shit ! You see , in the year 1902 we were just a bunch of silver miners . Out there every day digging in the dirt ... uneducated , and humping on each other ... every chance we could . Hell , sometimes some of us good ole boys 'd even be humping on each other . And it weren 't like we were be trying to be fancy . We just didn 't know what the hell we were looking at . Did we John ? Yeah we did Huh . So one day i dug up this rock and it was a brand new color . Not a trace or hint or nothing ... of any other color you ever seen . It looked like , like memories and , well , it was embarrassing . And if you looked at it ... all the parts of your brain that just sat there doing nothing ... would start right up and you knew what they were there for . So we looked at it and it turned us real smart . The next . Day we went into town and read all there was to read about the Chart . Then we went out into the desert , built us this big barn ... and sent it up here into space with us in it . Been here ever since . Now the one thing we didn 't reckon on was space punies . What are space punies ? Hey Jake . What are space punies ? In a world without gravity ... the muscles will become dormant and whither . Your spine will straighten and the calcium ... in your arms and legs will redistribute itself in your head . Thank you , Jake . See old Jake knows . Hey Jake , what happens if you go back to Earth with Space punies ? It kills you sllckerthan snot . That 's right ... So now we got to get back there cause every day ... they 're making further discoveries about the Chart . In an attempt to further our knowledge ... Jake and Edna started humping on each other ... And io and behold , a child was born among us . Had we known he 'd have grown up to be such a hellion ... we 'd have killed him on that day . Instead we raised him on coffee , tobacco , candy bars ... kind of stuff our guts couldn 't take . We built him a suit of hydraulics ... so his muscles would grow strong . He was raised to stand up against Earth 's gravity ... as he set out to gain more knowledge on behalf of his kin ... A journey the boy don 't know nothing about ... on account of him being as dumb as a stick . How are you planning on getting him back to Earth ? We 's kind of hoping you 'd take him . Let 's see if we can get his chocolate and cigarettes . If we take him to Earth , can we keep his chocolate and cigarettes ? We ain 't got no need for it . Okay . I hope you don 't mind if we take ourtime loading up . We 're trying to avoid someone . That 'll give you boys some time to get acquainted . He 's right through that doorthere . Thanks . If you ever find us again ... could you tell us what the chart 's looking like these days ... Captain ? Captain ? He stinks . What ? He stinks . Excuse me . Well . Let 's get him out of that stinky suit . Smell your hand . What if we leave him in the suit and wash him as he is ? We should probably just wipe him down with solvent . Pin him . Thls Is the Rlo Yetl . Okay ? And when i do this line ... i 'm going to talk and when i do the next line i 'm going to move your mouth like this . Okay ? South America is where i want to go . Don 't you fear Yeti 's in Rio ? No . No ? No . Rio Yeti . Rio Yeti . Rio Yeti . Rio Yeti . When i get to Venus , can i get a dog ? Dogs can 't live on Venus . When they roll on their backs the ... pressure twists their guts up and it kills them . Do you remember my old dog ? Yeah . If i don 't like Venus will you come get me ? Belleve me ... You 'll like it . What are you going to do ? South America is where i 'm going to go . Don 't you fearthe Yetis in Rio ? No . No ? No ! No , No , No , No , No , No , No , No , No , No ... Ri-o Ye-ti , Ri-o Ye-ti , Ri-o Ye-ti ... No ! No , No , No , No , No , No , No , No , No . Ri-o Ye-ti , Ri-o Ye-ti , Ri-o Ye-ti ... Uh oh . Did i say something i should not have ? No . No ? No ! No , No , No , No , No , No , No , No , No . Ri-o Ye-ti , Ri-o Ye-ti , Ri-o Ye-ti ... What did your fatherteach you ? What did your fatherteach you ? My fathertaught me to kill the sunflower . Congratulatlons , Mr. Curtis , you are now awake . Ten minutes to Venus . What the fuck ? How many minutes ? You all ready for your big day ? You take care of him . I 'll be back in a bit . What style . What class . The girl with the vagina made of glass . So perfect and pure , and gynecoiogically demure . And the way her buttocks chews on her shorts is very nice . Oh , yes , it 's very nice . And the way her perfect bosoms need no support ... Oh , yes , that too is very nice . And wherever she may go all heavens surround her . Envy 's green-eyed monsters confound her . Age-oid myths and legends come true . Ancient prophecies all come to pass . All this and all because of you ... the girl with the vagina made of glass . Why , Samuei Curtis , you flatter me . My dear Cioris , any beautiful words spoken on your behalf would only ... Well , if you were only twenty years younger ... we 'd all have ourway with you . Which brings me to another subject . Not that i could evertire of speaking on your behalf ... but i would llke to proposition you . You have my attentions . Piease don 't think that my complete focus is not on you and the ladies ... but in my peripheral ... i couldn 't help but notice the handsome remains of a gentleman . Johnny R. We still love him so . Honest we do . But it just hasn 't been the same since his Venusian demise . Yeah , i imagine it wouldn 't be . You know , his family would llke his body back . We are all well aware of that , Samuei Curtis . We are also aware of the honorarium they have offered ... and the greedy , heartless show of scavengery we might expect ... as a result of their generous offer . We might also have expected that you , Samuei Curtis ... could have been a little more sensitive to our feelings ... instead of being the first to come and try to take away ourJohnny . I was actually going to swap you for him . What could you have that would possibly match the value ... of our beloved Johnny 's remains ? I 've got a sixteen year oid boy in my ship . Oh , Samuei . I swear , we had no way of knowing . How could you know ? Your messenger never mentioned a swap . He just said that you were coming . - My messenger ? - Hi , Sam . Jesus Christ ! That 's Professor Hess . A Professor ? ! Did you miss me ? No . Yes you did . You did too miss me . You 're just saying that to make me mad . The Professor brought us a cat . Cioris ... i 'm afraid i won 't be able to stay . Have your ladies dig my ship out of the mud ... and load Johnny into the bottom cargo hatch . Why , a visit from Mr. Curtis wouldn 't be the same if we didn 't have to dig his ship out of our mud . Oh , Samuei . The Professor suggests that we should meet the boy first . I 'll go get him . But if we could just make this fast . Of course . And Samuei ? He is descended from great wealth , is he not ? Yeah . And please tell me he is a good dancer . The ladies do love to dance . Yeah , he 's great . I 'll have him bring his trophy . Move ! I keep trying to get ready and he keeps jumping in front of the mirror ... playing with his face . You 're not going out there . What ? ! Shut up . Professor Hess is here . If he sees you he 's going to kill you . Why 's he want to kill me ? No reason . Let 's fly out of here . There not going to dig out our ship until they get a boy . Him . Yeah . That 's what i 'm thinking . Put on some of my clothes and give him yours . Why does he have to wear my clothes ? He doesn 't have to ... he gets to . Ladies ... here 's your new lover boy . Well , isn 't he fancy . Who the hell is that ? That 's the new King of Venus . That is not Lee Vllensky 's boy . Well , Samuei , please explain . Who is this fanciful dandy who has so quickly stolen our hearts ? What ! ? That 's the wealthiest child in the Soiar System . He is not . Yes he is . No he isn 't . Yes , he is . Oh . He seems to be in need of a bath . I haven 't noticed . Smell your hand . I will kill him . You have every reason to kill him . Good luck , Professor . Samuei Curtis ! It 's my birthday . Some othertime , Professor . This is where it ends ... and other stories began . Sam moved back to earth with the young man who saw the breast ... and raised him as if he were his own son . I stayed on Venus to help raise Bodysuit ... in the hopes that he would grow up to be a fine young man ... and i could kill him . But a boy seldom lives up to his Father 's expectations .

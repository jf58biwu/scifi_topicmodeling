 Pardon me for intruding ... but I believe y 'all are carrying something of mine . Ain 't yours . Did you think we wouldn 't find out you changed your route ? You gonna give us what 's due us and every damn thing else on that boat . And I think maybe you gonna give me a little one-on-one time with the missus . Oh , I think you might want to reconsider that last part . See , I married me a powerful ugly creature . How can you say that ? How can you shame me in front of new people ? If I could make you prettier , I would . You are not the man I met a year ago . Now , think real hard . You been bird-doggin' this township a while now . They wouldn 't mind a corpse of you . You can luxuriate in a nice jail cell ... but if your hand touches metal , I swear by my pretty floral bonnet ... I will end you . Take him . - In the morning , we 'll head for Beaumond . Give you a chance to find some work of your own . I appreciate it . This is lovely , but- - Not your clientele ? I understand . - You gotta play at being a lady . - Well , yes . So , explain to me again why Zoe wasn 't in the dress . Tactics , woman . Needed her in the back . Besides , those soft cotton dresses feel kinda nice . There 's a whole airflow . You 'd know that because- - You can 't open the book of my life and jump in the middle . Like woman , I 'm a mystery . Oh , best keep it that way . I withdraw the question . It makes the rain come when you turn it . The rain 's very scarce . It comes only when needed most . And such it is ... with men like you . This is the most- - You- - friend . You 're the guy ! I 'll treasure this . Elder Gommen , thank you for the hospitality . We owe you a great debt . I 'm sorry we have so little to pay it with ... though I hope our gifts will show our regard . I don 't think Jayne 's ever letting ' go of that stick . Alliance patrol boat heading into atmo right now . Well , we gotta fly . We 'll pray for a safe voyage ... and hope to lay eyes on you again ere too long , my friend . - Count on it . Bye , now . - Bless you . - Who the hell are you ? - What do you mean ? I think I was pretty clear . What are you doing on my boat ? You know I 'm to cleave to you . To " wubba " who ? Did Elder Gommen not tell you ? Tell me what ? Wh- - Who are you ? Mr. Reynolds , sir ... I 'm your wife . ~ Take my love , take my land ~ ~ Take me where I cannot stand ~ ~ I don 't care , I 'm still free ~ ~ You can 't take the sky from me ~ ~ Take me out to the black ~ ~ Tell them I ain 't comin 'back ~ ~ Burn the land and boil the sea ~ ~ You can 't take the sky from me ~ ~ There 's no place I can be ~ ~ Since I 've found serenity ~ ~ But you can 't take the sky from me ~ Could you repeat that , please ? I am your wife . That was your agreement with Elder Gommen ... since he hadn 't cash or livestock- - I-I 'm sorry . Go back to the part where you 're my wife . I don 't please you ? You can 't please me . You never met me . Zoe , why do I have a wife ? You got a wife ? All I got was that dumb-ass stick sounds like it 's rainin ' . - How come you got a wife ? - I didn 't . - We 're not married . - I 'm sorry that I shame you . You don 't shame me . Zoe , would you get Wash ? This is Zoe . - We need all personnel in the cargo bay . - " All " ? I said Wash . Captain , everyone should have a chance to congratulate you on your day of bliss . There 's- - There 's no bliss . I don 't know this girl . Then can I know her ? Jayne ! Don 't sully this . You are gonna be cleaning latrines with your face if you don 't cut that out . Who 's the new recruit ? Everybody , I want you all to meet ... Mrs. Reynolds . You got married ? Wow , that 's , uh- - Congratulations . We 'd always hoped you two kids would get together . Who is she ? She 's no one . Captain ! Would you stop that ? - I 'm sorry . - You brute . Oh , sweetie , don 't feel bad . He makes everybody cry . He 's like a monster . I 'm not a monster ! Wash , turn the ship around . - Can 't . - It 's an order . - Yeh , we can 't . - Have you got an encyclopedia ? $ $ # # $ $ . There 's already a bulletin on the cortex as to the murder of a prefect 's nephew . That 's right . One of our bandits has family ties . So unless you feel like walking into a gallows , I suggest we continue on to Beaumond ... and you , enjoy your honeymoon . This isn 't happening . Would you stop crying ! For God 's sake , Mal , could you be a human being for 30 seconds ? - As one married man to another- - - I 'm not married ! I 'm sorry . You- - You have very nice qualities , but I didn 't ever marry you . I believe you did ... last night . - How drunk was I last night ? - I don 't know . I passed out . It says here ... " The woman lays the wreath upon her intended- - " which I do recall . - " Which represents his sovereignty . - That was you ? 'And he drinks of her wine . And then there 's a dance with a joining of hands . " The marriage ceremony of the Triumph settlers . You , sir ... are a newlywed . What 's it say in there about divorce ? $ $ # # $ $ ... $ $ # # $ $ . I really think you 're the one to talk to her , sir . The way I see it , me and her got one thing in common . We 're the only ones who don 't think this is funny . Hello ! Woman ... person . You all right ? I thought last night during the ceremony that you were pleased . Well , yeah , last night I was . Had some mulled wine , pretty girl gave me a hat made out of a tree . Nobody said I was signing up to have and to hold . Are you gonna kill me ? What ? What kind of crappy planet is that ? Kill you . In the maiden 's home , I heard talk of men who weren 't pleased with their brides- - Well , I ain 't them . And don 't you ever stand for that sort of thing . Someone ever tries to kill you , you try to kill them right back . Look , wife or no ... you are no one 's property to be tossed aside . You got the right , same as anyone ... to live and try to kill people . I mean , you know , people that are- - That- - That 's a dumb planet . What will you do with me ? I 'm not really sure . We 're bound for Beaumond . It 's a decent kind of planet . Might be able to set you up with some sort of work there . I 'll not be anyone 's doxy . I don 't mean whoring . They got factories and the like . Some ranches , if you 're more for the outdoors . Near a week before we get there . I 'll figure something . I 'd be a good wife . Yeah , well , I 'd be a terrible husband . You have five whole days to figure that out . For five days we 'll be together ? Well , we 'll be together on the ship , but not in any- - That 'll be fine . I 'll do for you ... or not , as you choose . Well , shiny . Hungry ? Kitchen 's just through there . I 'll cook you something . Well , no . I meant for you . I 'm a fine cook . Everyone says . That 's- - It 's great . Look , hold it . Hold . - I ain 't never even- - - My name is Saffron . Divorce is very rare and requires dispensation from her pastor . I can send him a wave , see what I can do . I appreciate that . She 's a nice girl . - Seems very anxious to please you . - It 's their way , I guess . I suppose so . If you take sexual advantage of her ... you 're going to burn in a very special level of hell ... a level they reserve for child molesters ... and people who talk at the theater . Wh- - I am not- - Preacher , you got a smutty mind . - Perhaps I spoke out of turn . - Per-maybe-haps , I 'm thinkin ' . I apologize . I 'll make her up a room in the passenger dorm . Good . The special hell . Thank you . Looks- - Something smells good . Having yourself a little supper , Captain ? Saffron insisted on it . You know , I didn 't want to make her feel- - This is damn tasty . Is there any more where that came from ? I didn 't think to make enough for your friends ... but everything 's laid out if you 'd like to cook for your husband . Yeah . Isn 't she quaint ? I 'm just not hungry . So ... are you enjoying your own nubile little slave girl ? She wanted to make me dinner . At least she 's not crying . I might . Did she really make fresh bao ? Quaint ! - Remember that sex we were planning to have ever again ? - You 're all making a big deal . I would appreciate it if one person on this boat would not assume ... that I 'm an evil , lecherous hump . Nobody 's saying that , sir . We 're pretty much just giving each other significant glances ... and laughing incessantly . - Is that cider ? - By the stove . Yum . I 'll get you a refill . Honey ? That 's for me to do . You know , uh , you weren 't lyin about your cookin ' . If I hadn 't already eaten- - - You don 't want to finish ? - No , I just , um- - I have captainy things to do , but truthfully , that 's a fine meal . - Thank you . - Do you need anything else ? No . No . Um , you just have something to eat yourself , and , uh ... and I 'm gonna go ... captain . If you 're done with supper ... would you like me to wash your feet ? Beaumond . City of New Dunsmuir . Arrival : October 24 . - Departure- - - Can I come in ? - No . - See ? That 's why I usually don 't ask . What do you want ? Oh , I just needed to ... hide . - So I take it the honeymoon is over ? - Oh , she 's a fine girl . Don 't misread me . A hell of a cook too . I 'm sure she has many exciting talents . Do you ever ... wash your clients ' feet ? It 's my specialty . - We 'll be on Beaumond at least two weeks , right ? - Can 't exactly be sure . I need you to be exactly sure . I can 't make commitments and then not keep them . That 's your specialty . Sorry . Are you touchy because I got myself a bride or ' cause I don 't plan to keep her ? I find the whole thing degrading . That 's just what Saffron said about your line of work . Maybe you should think twice about letting go of Saffron . You two sound like quiet a match . Maybe you 're right . Maybe we 're soul mates . Yes . Great . I wish you hundreds of fat children . Could you imagine that ? Me with a whole passel of critters underfoot . - Hell , in ten years ' time- - - Can you leave me alone for five minutes , please ? I wasn 't lookin ' for a fight . Always do seem to find one , though . Do I have your attention ? Kind of going to extremes here , ain 't we ? There 's times I think you don 't take me seriously . I think that oughta change . Do you think it 's likely to ? You got something you don 't deserve . And it 's brought me a galaxy of fun , I 'm here to tell ya . Six men came to kill me one time ... and the best of them carried this . It 's a Callahan full-bore auto lock . Customized trigger . Double cartridge thorough gauge . It is my very favorite gun . $ $ # # $ $ Are you offering me a trade ? A trade ? Hell , it 's theft . This is the best damn gun made by man . It has extreme sentimental value . - It 's miles more worthy than what you got . - What I got ? - She has a name . - So does this . I call it Vera . My days of not taking you seriously are certainly coming ' to a middle . - Damn it , Mal . I 'd treat her okay . - She 's not to be bought . Nor bartered , or borrowed , or lent . She 's a human woman , doesn 't know a thing about the world and needs our protection . - Well , I 'll protect her . - Jayne . Go play with your rain stick . You do sneak about , don 't you ? You 're a good man . You clearly haven 't been talkin to anyone else on this boat . I don 't wish to be wed to the large one . I 'd rather- - If I 'm not to be yours ... I 'd rather have the work you spoke of . I could be useful in a ranch . It 's good work . My mama had a ranch back on Shadow , where I 'm from . Ran cattle , mostly . Wasn 't nobody ran ' em harder or smarter . She used to tell me , " Don 't brand the cattle . Brand the buyer . He 's the one likely to stray . " - She raised you herself ? - Well , her and about 40 hands . I had more family for a kid- - - That is odd . - What ? I just don 't- - I 'm not one who talks about what 's past , and here you got me- - Does your crew never show interest in your life ? No . They ... are- - They just know me well enough to- - Well , what about you ? What 's your history ? Not much to say . Life like yours , I figure you 'd find mine terrible dull . Oh , I long for a little dullness . Truth to say ... this whole trip 's gettin ' to be just a little too interesting . It 's a wreck . - No , this is good . - It 's parts . A lot of cheap parts we 'll never unload . This is why you 'll never be in charge , Bree . - You don 't see the whole . The parts are crap . - I said exactly that . But you put it together , you got a Firefly . Thing 'll run forever , they got a mechanic even half awake . It 's got no flash . Some people ain 't lookin ' for flash . She 's a good catch . She comes our way , you prep the nets . Clearly , she 's out of her mind . Really ? She 's led a sheltered life . Did you see the way she grabbed that glass from you ? Every planet has its own weird customs . About a year before we met , I spent six weeks on a moon ... where the principle form of recreation was juggling geese . My hand to God . Baby geese . Goslings . They were juggled . Of course . The man rushes in to defend her . I 'm talking about geese . Captain shouldn 't be baby-sitting a damn groupie , and he knows it . Okay , when did this become not funny ? When you didn 't put her ass back down on Triumph where it belongs . Oh , hey ! Now it 's even my fault ? Is there anything else on your mind I should know about ? - There 's all sorts of twists and cul-de-sacs . It 's wild . - She 's trouble . I 'm getting that . I 'm going to bed . Hey ! Well , you 're , uh ... uh , well ... there you are . I 've made the bed warm for you . It- - It looks , uh ... warm . And I 've made myself ready for you . Let 's ride right past the part where you explain exactly what that means . Didn 't you see you got a room of your own ? And I 'm to sleep there ? That 's the notion ... assuming you 're--yeah- - sleepy . But we 've been wed . Aren 't we to become one flesh ? Well , no . Uh , we 're still two fleshes here and ... I think that your flesh oughta sleep somewhere else . I 'm sorry . When we talked , I 'd hoped- - Whoa , hey . Flesh . Um ... Saffron ... i-it- - it ain 't a question of pleasing me . It 's more a question of what 's- - um , of what 's morally right . I do know my Bible , sir . " On the night of their betrothal ... " the wife shall open to the man as the furrow to the plow ... " and he shall work in her ... " in and again ... " till she bring him to his full ... and rest him then upon the sweat of her breast . " Oh . Good Bible . I 'm not skilled , sir , nor a pleasure to look upon . Saffron . You 're pleasing . You 're , uh- - Hell , you 're all kinds of pleasin ' ... and , uh , it 's- - it 's been a while- - a long damn while- - since anybody but me took ahold of my plow ... so don 't think for a second that I ain 't interested . But you and me , we ain 't married . Just ' cause you got handed to me by some $ $ # # $ $ who couldn 't pay off his debts ... don 't make you beholden to me . - I keep trying to explain . - Let me explain . I lived my life in the maiden house ... waiting to be married off for trade . I seen my sisteren paired off with ugly men ... vicious or blubberous ... men with appetites ... too unseemly to speak on . And I 've cried for those girls . But not half so hard as I cried the night they gave me to you . Why ? Is there blubber ? I cried for I 'd not dreamed ... to have a man so sweet ... so kind and beautiful . Had I the dare to choose , I 'd choose you ... from all the men on all the planets the night sky could show me . If I 'm wed ... I am a woman ... and I 'll take your leave to be bold . I want this . I swell to think of you in me . And I see that you do too . Oh , th-that 's just , uh- - Leave me at the nearest port . Never look upon me again . I 'll make my way with the strength that you 've taught me . Only let me have my wedding night . Oh , I 'm gonna go to the special hell . I 've- - I really wish it was that simple , girl , but- - Son of a- - Night , sweetie . Well , if it isn 't the master chef . Not sleepy ? - Am I allowed to be up here ? - Well , sure . Why not ? It 's not like anyone else is taking up space . I 've never been off-world before . - It 's beautiful , isn 't it ? - It 's like a dream . Planet I 'm from , couldn 't see one of ' em , pollution so thick . Sometimes I think I entered flight school ... just to see what the hell everyone was talking about . What are you doing ? Now we 're alone , just us and the stars . No ship , no bellowing engines ... no crew to bicker at each other . Look . Come look . Do you know the myth of Earth that was ? Not so much . That when she was born , she had no sky ... and was open , inviting . And the stars would rush into her ... - through the skin of her- - - Yeah . making the oceans boil with sensation . And when she could endure no more ecstasy ... she puffed up her cheeks and blew out the sky . Whoa . Good myth . My whole life , I saw nothing ... but roofs and steeples and the cellar door . In a few days , I 'll be back to that life and gone from yours . Make this night what it should be . Please ? Show me the stars . $ $ # # $ $ ... I wish I was somebody else right now . Somebody not married , not madly in love with a beautiful woman ... who can kill me with her pinky . - I 've been too forward . - No ! Well , yes . But I actually like that in a woman . That 's part of why Zoe and I are , as previously mentioned , married . I thought- - She didn 't seem to respect you . Not everybody gets me and Zoe at first glance . Did it get very hot in here ? I need airflow . You love her very much . Yeah . I never did meet anyone quite like Zoe . The , uh , the first time we met , she actually- - Are you lost ? I 'm sorry . I thought the other shuttle was yours . It is . I was on the cortex and my screen shorted . This one 's out too . - Looking for customers ? - What were you looking for ? I don 't mean to be rude . A Companion 's life is so glamorous and strange . I wish I had the skill for such a trade . You 'd like to please your new husband ? He 'll have none of me . For true , I 'm somewhat relieved . If I 'm to learn of love ... I 'd like it to be at the hands of someone gentle . Someone who could ... feel what I feel . But Mal said you- - you don 't approve of my work . Sure , and he said that to keep you from me . I was too curious about you ... ever since I saw you . Come to my shuttle . You would- - you would lie with me ? I guess we 've lied enough . - You 're good . - You 're amazing . Who are you ? Malcolm Reynolds 's widow . Baby ? Wake up . - He 's bleeding . - There 's no one in there . What 's going on ? Mal ! Mal , Mal , Mal , Mal , Mal ! $ $ # # $ $ ! Get the doctor . Mal 's hurt . He- - Oh . Oh , you stupid son of a- - Is it Christmas ? Well , he 's back . What happened about me ? Your blushing bride was a plant . She took both of you out . - How did- - - Narcotic compound . Probably spread over a seal on her lips . You get it on yours , and pow . - Lips , huh ? - Well- - We used to get a lot of guys brought in on the night shift at the E.R ... . usually robbed , very groggy . - They called it the good-night kiss . - So you two were kissin ' ? Well , isn 't that ... special . - Wash , how did- - - Hey , I just got kicked in the head . My man would never fall for that $ $ # # $ $ . - Most of my head wishes I had . - You guys don 't understand . Seems pretty simple from here . You were taking advantage ofher- - - I was the one being taken advantage of . - My apologies . You were victimized , Wash was beaten ... and Inara found you here . Yeah , then I fell . My head got hurt , like Wash . - I don 't get any of this . - I only fell , is all . - What the hell 's our status ? - We 're shut down . Jayne and Kaylee are trying to get us on the bridge . All we know is we 're headed somewhere , and it ain 't Beaumond . Oh , I 'm fine . I don 't need to be examined . I 'm comfy . She didn 't just lock it . She fused it to something . Both entrances . What the big act ? What was she after ? Besides molesting innocent captains ? You want to stow it , Preacher ? We 're in some peril here . - If she can fly this thing , why just take the shuttle ? - Maybe she likes shuttles . Some people juggle geese . - She 's a pro . - This is a masterful job of muck up . - See how she crossed the dry feeds ? - Yeah-huh . So we even try to reroute , it 'll lock down . $ $ # # $ $ ! - She went straight for the thermal cap . - Yeah , yeah ! We are so hung . I 'm glad you two are having a good time under there . Can we progress to the making it right ? - That 's not gonna happen for a long while , Captain . - We don 't have a long while . We could be headed straight into a nice , big , solid moon , for all we know so ... how 's about we get to work ? Hey . It was your big make-out session that got us into this , sir . - I was poisoned . - You were drugged . That 's why I never kiss ' em on the mouth . Well , what can you do ? Give us time , we can get the cortex and navcon back on-line , at least see where we 're headed . - What about steering ? - What about stopping ? She humped us hard . We 're gonna have to do a lot- - Do it . Doesn 't help me to see where I 'm goin ' if I can 't change course . This girl really knows her ships . That 's not all she knows . She 's well-schooled . You mean the sedative , the good-night kiss ? I only hit my head , but Mal went through that . But no- - I mean , seduction , body language , signals . She 's had training , as in Companion ... as in academy . Our little Saffron 's quite a wonder . I 'm beginning to think she married beneath herself . How do you know ? About the training . She tried to seduce me too . Really ? Did she- - Did you- - You don 't play a player . It was sloppy of her to try it , but I think she was in a rush . But she had professional- - So in my case , I mean , it was really- - You would have kissed her too . - Wash didn 't . - But she was naked and all articulate . Okay ! Everybody not talking about sex , in here . Everybody else , elsewhere . They 're coming ! - How far out ? - Ten minutes or so . Right on target . Speed : A-1 . - Huh . That girl 's a wonder . - She gets it done . I 'll tell the boys . Yes ! You got it ? We got life , we got screens . It 's a qualified yes , a partial . - What about nav control ? - No . So where are we headed ? The coordinates she entered , we 're headed for something , and it 's not too far . - Did she signal anybody ? - $ $ # # $ $ . She did . Same coordinates , no I.D. Who 's out there ? Let me see ifher signal wave can translate to a visual . There might be- - Hey , uh- - Electromagnetic interference . It 's bouncing the signal all over the place . Look at it . It 's like a circle . It 's a net . I don 't get it . Where are we headed ? The end of the line . It 's a carrion house . Scrap shop . Takes ships , pulls them apart or fixes them up . - Doesn 't sound that scary . - That pattern you 're looking at is a net . We fall into that , we 're more than helpless . It 'll turn the ship into one big electrical conduit , burn us all from the inside out . Some of the newer ones will just hold you ... and then the scrappers will override the air locks ... pull the O2 or just gas you . They 're not looking to deal with survivors . One day you 're gonna tell us all how a preacher knows so much about crime . - Kaylee ? - I 'm trying , sir . Keep on it . We can 't fall into that net . We 're gonna need a Plan " B. " Zoe , get our suits prepped now . I figure we got one shot at this . - Give me a visual as soon as we 're close . - It won 't be long . What do I do ? You go get Vera . She needs oxygen around her to fire her , and we don 't have a case . - We 're gonna use a suit . - Here , we got it . What am I aiming ' for , the window ? That might kill some folk , but it won 't short the net . See these six points where it 's brightest ? Those are the breakers . Hit one of those , should short it out . What do you mean , " should " ? You see it ? Clear as day . See , Vera ? Dress yourself up , you get taken out somewhere fun . We got it . It 's not pretty ... but we can steer enough to turn the hell around . - Nice work , Kaylee . - Not soon enough to help . Hey , it 's a lot easier to pull things apart than it is to put ' em right . You 're still the best mechanic floating ' . - Captain , don 't you know kissing girls makes you sleepy ? - Sometimes I can 't help myself . Now , let 's go visiting . Honey , I 'm home . Looks like you get that wedding night after all . It 's the first time , darlin ' . - I think you should be gentle with me . - You gonna kill me ? Can you conjure up a terribly compelling reason for me not to ? I didn 't kill you . You handed me and my crew over to those that would kill us . That buys you nothing . I made you dinner . Why the act ? All the seduction games , the dancing about folk . There has to be an easier way to steal . You 're assuming the payoff is the point . - I 'm not assuming anything at this juncture . - How 'd you find me ? Only a few places that shuttle would make it to from where you left . Happy to find it intact . You 're quite a man , Malcolm Reynolds . I 've been waiting a long time for someone good enough to take me down . Saffron ... you even think about playing me again ... I will riddle you with holes . Everybody plays each other . That 's all anybody ever does . We play parts . You got all kinds of learning ' , and you made me look the fool without tryin ' ... and yet here I am with a gun to your head . That 's ' cause I got people with me , people who trust each other ... who do for each other and ain 't always lookin ' for the advantage . Promise me you 're gonna kill me soon . Oh , you already know I ain 't gonna . You know , you did pretty well . Most men , they 're on me inside of ten minutes ... not tryin ' to teach me to be strong and the like . I got one question for ya ... just one thing I 'd like to know straight up . Ask me . What 's your real name ? You 'd only have lied anyhow . Come in . Back on course . Be on Beaumond a day or two late . Hope it 's all right . It should be fine , thank you . And does the vixen live ? Yeah , if you can call it that . All 's well , I suppose . Yes . You 're a very graceful woman , Inara . I- - Thank you . So here 's where I 'm fuzzy . You got by that girl , came and found me ... and somehow you happened to just trip and fall . - What do you mean ? - Come on , Inara . How 's about we don 't play ? You didn 't just trip , did you ? No . Well , isn 't that something ? I knew you let her kiss you . Subtitles by krack

Thank you very much . I gotta say- - might not have turned out like we 'd hoped , but the King would 've been proud . - Take that stupid thing off ! . - I kinda like it . You 're rubbing my nose in defeat . Take it off . Langly , we all thought we were onto something . On paper , this man Eames looks like the real Elvis . Same birthday , same birthplace , same height and blood type . It could 've been him , hiding in plain sight , doing what he does best . You know , call me crazy , but I 'm startin to think that maybe Elvis is really dead . [ Doorbell Buzzes ] Seriously , man , take it off . [ No Audible Dialogue ] - Can I help you ? - Melvin ? It 's Alberta Pfeiffer . Do I know you ? It 's just like I pictured it . [ Gasps ] Oh . And there 's Richard . " Ringo . " Though I wish you 'd cut your hair . And you must be the new one- - Jimmy . I love your smile . But , John ... your words have stirred my soul- - so principled , so strong . - You 're one of our readers ? - From the first issue , twelve years ago . Haven 't missed one since , which is why I 've come to you . As a last resort , believe me . Mrs. Pfeiffer 's son , Douglas , is on death row in Texas ... awaiting execution . I 'm his attorney , Jeremy Wash . He stands convicted of murder . He 's not guilty . I know every mother says that about her outlaw son , but in this case it 's true . And you want us to prove it . I want you to talk to him , but that 's asking a lot . Lately Douglas refuses to talk to anyone , even me . I can 't get in . The only person he 'll have a visit with is Jeremy here . We have several steps left in the appeals process , but , uh , Doug wants to streamline things . He won 't say why , but he 's pushing for an execution date . One could be set as early as next week . Eighteen months ago he pleaded not guilty . He fought his conviction tooth and nail ... and now he says he wants to die ... and he won 't explain it to anybody . There 's some sort of conspiracy here . Some sort of- - [ Sobs ] I don 't know what . But , John , if anybody can figure it out ... it 's you four . [ Whimpering ] [ Sobbing ] - [ Door Opens , Shuts ] - What are we gonna do ? - Well , not a whole hell of a lot . - What ? Hey , we can hack into the police record . We can read the trial transcripts ... but we 're not talkin ' to Mr. Pfeiffer if he doesn 't wanna talk to us . But guys , his mom . Come on . Jimmy , I 'm not confident you 're aware of this ... but you can 't just walk into a penitentiary . - The A-Team did . - Nah , oh , God , Here we go . The A-Team snuck into this prison , dressed up like inmates ... and then busted the guy out who was wrongfully accused . I mean , yeah , I know it 's a TVshow and all , but the theory is sound . Jimmy , every half-baked TVseries that runs out of ideas in the fourth or fifth season ... does their " sneak into prison dressed as an inmate " show . - What does that have to do with what we 're talkin ' about here ? - Not one of us ... would last ten seconds inside a prison . Jefferson said ... " Better 100 guilty men go free , than one innocent man be condemned . " [ Snaps Finger ] TheJeffersons . I think they did it on that show too . I think , maybe , we could do it . I think it 's worth a try . We defend the defenseless . I don 't see any other way . - You ready for this ? - Are you ? We 're runnin ' outta time . Can you get ' em in or not ? I can get ' em in . Ask me if I can get ' em out . Where 'd you all come from ? " Wesley " and " Dillinger .

This is your inmate orientation handbook . Do not lose it . Do not trade it . Read it cover to cover . - [ Buzzer Sounds , Distant ] - It spells out all the rules . Follow the rules , and there will be privileges . Break the rules , and I promise you , it only gets worse from here . [ Guard ] Step back . - Lock ' em down . - [ Buzzer ] - [ Motor Whirring ] - [ Whirring Stops ] - Give me your hands . - [ Jimmy ] You okay ? - Yeah . It 's not like on TV . [ Man ] Jiminy ! Jiminy .

Um , that man next to you is trying to get his cricket back . - It 's right in front of your cell . - Jimmy , it 's a cockroach . Sir ? - [ Sizzles ] - [ Mutters ] Jimmy , don 't lose sight of why we 're here . I know . Douglas Pfeiffer . No innocent man should be in this place . Ah , this is pointless . - Place is obviously gutted . - How was I supposed to know it 's out of business ? We 're here , so let 's check it out . [ Lock Rattling ] What are you doin ' there ? - [ Lock Rattles ] - [ Clears Throat ] Um- - - We 're , um- - - We , uh- - We came for , uh , some burgers ... - uh , but obviously the restaurant 's closed , so- - - Well , I 'm callin ' the police . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , hold on a minute . Uh , we 're investigative reporters . This place is the scene of a murder a couple of years ago ? - [ Langly ] The man who was convicted is on death row . - [ Beep Tone ] Um , we think he might be innocent . The hell he is ! Uh , Pfeiffer- - wasn 't that his name ? - You 're familiar with the case ? - Oh , yeah . I run the glass shop two doors down . Old Wally was a sweetheart . I guarantee you he gave that guy Pfeiffer every dollar in the drawer without a peep . Bastard shot him anyway . Still , how you know it was Pfeiffer ? Because I saw him ! Thank God for Wally 's silent alarm , because we hear the cops comin ' and he runs off . But I saw his face , as plain as day . You take my word for it . Pfeiffer is absolutely a murderer ... and he killed a good man . You guys are barkin ' up the wrong tree . [ Soft Rustling ] [ Inmate ] Here you go , Jiminy . Yeah . Take it . Yeah , yeah . [ Chuckles ] Good Jiminy . Good . Good Jiminy Cricket . Yeah . Here ya go , man . Come on back here and eat this . Come on . Eat it up . Eat it up , Jiminy . Yeah . [ Chuckling ] Hey . There 's a man in here named Douglas Pfeiffer . You know him ? - [ Containers Rattling ] - [ Wheels Rolling , Approaching ] Lowry ain 't gonna say jack , man . He don 't talk . He don 't ? [ Sputtering ] H-H-He doesn 't ? He got him a sissy-ass lisp . Sound like a little bitch when he talk . " Thound " like " thith . " Don 't you ever mention it . Uh , wait . Douglas Pfeiffer- - do you know where he is ? Infirmary . Goon squad cold-kicked him good . Patchin ' him up now so they can send him back to the death house . - [ Wheels Rolling , Departing ] - Infirmary . Byers and Jimmy on death row . It 's their idea- - - Jimmy 's , sorta . - Yeah . It 's not like we 're in love with it . And here I thought Byers was the smart one . Did it ever occur to any of you to pose as prison guards ... or attorneys or official visitors from the governor 's office ? - That 's not how they did it on The A-Team . - [ Scoffs ] We need you to go in there , Yves , as a visitor . - Oh , please . - We need you to slip something to Byers so we can talk to him . - You can talk to him yourselves . - We tried that . - We went in posing as Byers 's brothers . - Yeah , and the dumb brother ... there got caught in the pat-down with this . I forgot I had it on me . As soon as I said the word " FireWire " .. they think it 's like explosives or somethin ' , the Philistines . Needless to say , we 're on their doo-doo list , plus now ... they 're gonna keep an eye on anyone coming to see Byers . But not Jimmy . Plus , you got your- - you know--your- - [ Sputters ] Feminine wiles , as it were . - Can 't you just fake an injury ? - The doctors would know . Well , then ... can 't you just fall down or kick the bars really hard or- - If I injure myself , they mayjust send me for psychological counseling . Jimmy , I 'll be the first to admit , this isn 't the world 's smartest plan ... but I have to get into that infirmary . Any fight I get myself into , I 'll make sure there 's a guard nearby who can stop it . - But- - Let me do it instead . - [ Door Buzzes Open , Distant ] No offense , Byers , but you 're not ... the fighting type . - I won 't have to be . - [ Door Shuts ] [ Footsteps Approaching ] Give me your hands . [ Handcuffs Rattling , Ratcheting ] - [ Guard ] Fall out . Recreation . - [ Buzzer Sounds ] He 's my bitch , Lowry ! Mess with him , you gotta go through me ! [ High Voice ] Okay . Thanks , Jimmy . [ Door Buzzes Shut ] [ Grunting Quietly ] [ Continues Grunting ] [ Imitating Lisp ] " Tho , " Lowry ... think it 'll " thnow " ? What ? I " thaid , " think it 'll " thnow " ? " Whath 's " your " besth guessth " ? You laughing at me ? [ Fence Clatters ] [ Crowd Murmuring Quietly ] Hi . " Sthill " mad ? [ Lisping ] I 'm gonna mess you up good . So " thensitive . " Hey , here 's your chance . - [ Yells ] - [ Byers Yelping ] - I 'll kill ya with my chance . - [ Grunting ] Some moron gets his self locked up in here with that waiting ' for him on the outside ? [ Straining , Choking ] [ Lowry Growls ] [ Lowry Roars ] - [ Door Shuts ] - Give me your hands . Where 's John ? - Infirmary . - [ Cuffs Ratcheting ] - You got a visitor . - [ Door Buzzes Open ] [ Southern Accent ] Hey , baby . You got a kiss for your wife ? How you holdin ' up in here ? Well , you know , can 't complain . Oh , I miss you , baby . Yeah ? Oh . Yeah . I miss you too ... 'cause ... you 're my wife and all . I mean , why wouldn 't I miss my wife ? God . I miss when we make love ... for , like , hours and hours , and I miss your secret touch ... and- - [ Chuckles ] I miss your- - - Well , of course I miss your- - - Cheetos ? How ' bout I buy you some Cheetos ? [ Chuckles ] - [ Motor Whirring ] - [ Package Drops ] Sir , would you please give these to my husband ? [ Footsteps Approaching ] So , how are the kids : little , uh , JimmyJunior and Peebo ? Does Peebo still have that , uh , weird thing with his nose ? No . Peebo is well . Thanks , baby . Aw , I like the puffy kind , not the crunchy . B-But , y-you know , whatever . Maybe I can trade it for somethin ' . No . Honey ? You keep those yourself . You keep those , and you think of me . Hey , uh , what are the chances of us gettin ' a conjugal visit ? [ Door Buzzes Open ] [ Strains ] Douglas Pfeiffer . I recognize you from your mug shots . The guards really worked you over , huh ? Douglas , I 'm here at the request of your mother . She says you 've been wrongly convicted , and yet you 're pressing for an execution date . To me that doesn 't make sense . Sounds like you 're doing it against your will . I 'm an investigative reporter . I wanna help you ... if you 'll let me . Your mother wanted me to know about your request to stop your appeals- - about wanting to die . I know you love her very much , Douglas . I know you don 't want to go out like this . You 'll break her heart . If you ever say anything ... about this again- - to me or anyone else- - I 'll cut your throat . That 's a good boy , Jiminy . Good boy . [ Static Burst ] Toy surprise . Hmm . - That 's Jiminy , huh ? - Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . I hope you don 't take this the wrong way , but if the first one is Jiminy ... how is it that that one 's Jiminy too ? Maybe it is the sameJiminy . Looks like him to me . Hmm . But the first one is ... dead . That 's if you believe things really die . I don 't . I think we just take a trip and come back . Maybe we learn something and move on , maybe we don 't . Old Jiminy here , he didn 't learn a damn thing . Maybe next time . [ Chuckles ] Mm-hmm . Hey , Spike . What are ya in for ? Murder . - Have you contacted Jimmy ? - Well , we were just about to do that when we got sidetracked . Mark my words : ifTexas doesn 't execute him , I will . - What 's so interesting ? - Mr. Pfeiffer 's finances . Twenty-six thousand in savings . And yet he robs a two-bit hamburger joint for a hundred and thirty-eight bucks in cash . - Why bother ? - Unless it wasn 't a robbery- - just meant to look like one . - A contract killing ? Who paid for it ? - That 's where it gets tricky . I back-traced the deposits through three separate shells ... to arrive at one Brazos Holding . The same Brazos Holding that now owns the restaurant that Pfeiffer robbed . They 've been buyin ' up most of that downtown area , which tells me ... someone 's making an old-fashioned Texas land grab ... - and isn 't above killing to do it . - [ Keystrokes ] So who is behind Brazos Holding ? [ Langly ] Well , drumroll , please . - Jeremy Wash . Pfeiffer 's lawyer . - [ Exhales ] [ Static ] Jimmy . Jimmy , are you receiving ? - Readin ' you loud and clear . This thing rocks . - Yeah , yeah . Now , Yves said you told her that Byers got into a fight . Yeah , but on purpose . Byers had to get into the infirmary where Pfeiffer is so that he could talk to him . Oh , man . You gotta get word to him , Jimmy . He 's barkin ' up the wrong tree . You two are tryin ' to save the wrong man . Pfeiffer is guilty . No matter what his mother says , he 's a killer for hire . No . No way . Come on . It 's true , Jimmy . And his own lawyer 's behind it all . - Oh , Mr. Wash ? - [ Langly ] Yeah . He 's got plans for a big high-rise development . A key landowner wouldn 't sell , so he paid Pfeiffer to have him murdered . - W-Wait . So why would Wash want us talkin ' to Pfeiffer ? - I 'm sure he doesn 't . But he 's gotta go through the motions . He 's supposed to be defending his client , right ? I 'm sure he never dreamed we 'd actually get you guys in there . [ Frohike ] Now , here 's the thing , man . Pfeiffer may not be innocent , but there 's a guy in there who is : a prisoner by the name of Wallace Crendall Atherton . - Yeah ? - [ Frohike ] We think Wash framed Atherton ... for the murder of another shopkeeper who wouldn 't sell- - a mechanic by the name of Michael Cueley . - [ Langly ] But Atherton is innocent . - Which cell 's he in ? Tollin ! - Your shadow 's in my house . - [ Beeps ] Get your shadow outta my house . Shut the hell up , Atherton . Go play with your bugs . [ Footsteps Departing ] - [ Door Buzzes Open ] - Thanks- - [ Door Shuts ] Wallace Crendall Atherton . - [ Phone Rings , Distant ] - Fella . I 'm healing ' up good . Tomorrow they 'll put me on death watch , and 36 hours after that- - It doesn 't have to be that way , Mr. Pfeiffer . My friends and I wanna help you . Why ? Like I said before , your mother told us all about you . Yeah . I 'd do anything for my mom . You 're right about that . Mr. Pfeiffer , about the murder you were convicted of- - I still got nothin ' to say . - [ Hits Desk ] - This Atherton guy ... was at the wrong place at the wrong time- - that 's for sure . Wash destroyed any piece of evidence that might prove his innocence . - We got squat that 'll save him . - Byers has to get a confession out of Pfeiffer . - It 's the only way . - [ Knocking ] - That 's Yves . What I wanna know , what does Wash have over Pfeiffer that Pfeiffer won 't rat him out ? Uh , Mr. Wash . [ Clears Throat ] Uh , Langly , Wash is here . Have you learned anything ? - [ Door Shuts ] - Um , learned anything ? Um , no . Nada . Sorry . - Where are your two friends ? - [ Paper Rustling ] He 's out getting his beard trimmed- - the one with the beard- - and then the other one is helping him . [ Rapping On Glass ] [ Rapping Longer ] - [ Banging On Glass ] - Aren 't you going to get that ? What ? Oh , the door . Uh , yeah , sure . Why not ? [ Banging Louder And Longer ] You know how you owed me before ? Now you really , really owe me . - I 'm taking these clothes off and burning them . - Hi . I 'm Jeremy Wash . Sorry to interrupt . You were saying ? - They " owe " you ? - Uh , I owe her . She 's agreed to marry me . I mean , can you believe it ? - Heh . - [ Chuckles ] Wow . No . Yeah , we 're goin ' to Vegas tonight . Give us a kiss , sweet cheeks . Of course , toad boy . Hmm . Well , happy nuptials . I just wanted you to know that Doug 's execution is going forward . Day after tomorrow . I have to break the news to Mrs. Pfeiffer ... unless you can offer us any hope ? [ No Audible Dialogue ] Well , thanks for your efforts . Yeah . Yeah , you bet . [ Sighs ] - " Toad boy " ? - " Sweet cheeks " ? - So , what did you get ? - I convinced this lonely credit union manager ... to let me peruse through his Stone Age , non-computerized files . Wash has been making deposits to Mrs. Pfeiffer 's account ever since her son 's conviction . Hmm . Explains why Pfeiffer won 't talk . Yeah , he gets the death penalty whether he rats out Wash or not . Wash can help his mother or harm her . If Pfeiffer goes quietly , she 'll be taken care of . - And meanwhile , this Atherton guy- - - Yeah , an innocent man- - he 's gonna die . [ Langly ] We can 't let this happen . We gotta get the poop on this lawyer Wash . [ Frohike ] The key is Pfeiffer . Jimmy 's got to get a message to Byers . His name is John . He 's in the infirmary . You 'll get it to him ? Yeah . Sure . - [ Sniffles ] You sure you can trust him ? - [ Door Buzzer , Distant ] I gotta trust people till they prove to me I can 't . Hmm . - Spike ? - Mm-hmm ? What if somebody knew you were innocent ? 'Cause you are innocent , right ? You , me and God know it . Right . Let 's say this somebody and his friends ... find a way to prove it and get you out . [ Chuckling ] That ain 't gonna happen . Huh . But what would you do , I mean , if you were a free man ? [ Sighs ] Well , sir- - [ Exhales ] first ... I would shake the hands of the men that set me free ... and thank ' em with all my heart . And never again would I squander ... a moment of precious time on Earth that God has given us . Hmm . And I would devote myself to realizing- - [ Breathing Shakily ] hmm- - my lifelong dream . What 's that dream ? Carin ' for those that can 't care for themselves- - to end the mistreatment of the most mistreated of all God 's creatures . You mean the poor ? I mean cockroaches . Cockroaches ? [ Crowd Murmuring Quietly ] [ Lisping ] So , talk . Pfeiffer 's being transferred to death watch tomorrow morning . So ? You 're gonna make sure he never gets there . - Well ? - Nothing . - Gave the guy the note like six hours ago . - What guy ? The trustee . He promised he 'd give it to Byers . Oh , yeah . Like that 's gonna work . We got less than eight hours before Pfeiffer gets transferred outta there . - Eight hours and we 'll never talk to him again . - [ Sighs ] I 'm sorry , guys . What are we gonna do ? We 're gonna save your butt . Later . So , how am I lookin ' there , Doc- - healthy enough to kill ? Please , Mr. Pfeiffer , you 're running out of time . - They 're about to transfer you out of here . - Prisoner ... got any smokes ? No . [ Sighs ] Take it anyway . Pfeiffer , it 's time to go . Put your whites on . - [ Buzzer Sounds ] - [ Door Opens ] You did it . Yeah , I did it . I 'm not who my mom thinks I am . No . But you could still be . Tell the truth . Tell the truth before it 's too late . [ Yells ] [ Continues Yelling , Straining ] Get Pfeiffer outta here . [ Breathing Heavily ] - Wesley , you 're comin ' with me . - [ Buzzer Sounds ] - Inmate 9990962 . - Uh , yeah , I think so . - Hands . - There was a problem with your transfer order . - [ Handcuffs Ratcheting ] - I think you and I both know what it was . - Open number seven . - [ Buzzer Sounds ] [ Runselhoff ] Step out . Sergeant Runselhoff , that man is innocent . He is not a murderer . - [ Tollin ] Go on . - He didn 't do it . - Don 't make me leave without my friends . - Son , this isn 't a place for you . You should 've spoken up a long time ago . Officers , sign for the prisoner . - What 'd you tell ' em ? - Computers told them , not us . You were sent to the wrong prison . You 're a Peeping Tom , not a killer . A Peeping Tom ? - What about Byers ? - Right here , Jimmy . [ Sighs ] Pfeiffer ? Let 's go home , boys . Sergeant , I 've been waiting 40 minutes ... and I feel like you people are giving me the runaround . - D-Did something happen to my client ? - Yes , sir . - An inmate attacked him in the infirmary . - Oh , God . He 's- - He 's not- - Dead ? Oh , no , sir . He 's fine . Good . Uh , so the transfer is going to proceed . Your client 's not bein ' transferred anywhere- - not yet . What are you talking about ? Doug . You 're fired . Mr. Pfeiffer just implicated you ... in the murders of Wally Spinela and Michael Cueley . You sent Lowry after me ? Couldn 't wait another 36 hours for me to die , you son of a bitch . There 's a couple of gentlemen here who are gonna wanna talk to you .

 [ Dog Barking ] [ Dog Whimpers ] Ripped By mstoll Whatever you 're looking for , Hobbes , chances are ... somebody 's already eaten it , banged it or burned it . You hear what I said ? Just give me a few minutes . This is no-man 's-land . It 's no place to be going for a stroll . I 'll be right back . [ Footsteps Approaching ] Home sweet friggin ' home . If you 're looking for your piggy bank , Hobbes ... That 's not what I 'm looking for . Turn that thing away . Whatever happened to her , Hobbes , she 's gone . Long gone . [ Dog Barking In Distance ] [ Grunting ] Pinocchio ? [ Dog Barks In Distance ] [ Door Creaks ] Hey ! Put him down ! [ Hobbes ] A world exists exactly like ours . You live in this world ... your family and friends ... and though you may not know it ... I was sent to save you . [ Voices Overlapping ] It 's just a game . - [ Siren Wailing In Distance ] - [ Sophie 's Voice ] Dear Tom ... It 's been two months since I was told you were dead . And though I hold on to the hope you 're alive ... time passes like an eternity as I wait for word . Hours feel like years . Days like a lifetime . No moment absent the thought of you . But though life goes on without you ... it must also end without you . In this , I have no choice . [ Buzzing ] [ Buzzing ] Hey ! Who 's paying attention here ? Hey ! Well , get me a towel . [ Buzzing Continues ] I 'm outta smokes here . [ Whirring ] Meat wagon . [ Chattering ] [ Man ] All right , let 's go ! Get down here ! Move it . Move it . Let 's go . Stay in line and keep moving ! What is this place ? Lumber camp . Forced labor . Subsidized by Santiago for the building of his empire . You got a way out of here ? I 'm thinking . 'Cause this guy finds out who we are , we 're dead . Observe the fence around you . It 's your protection . Everything you feared in Harsh Realm no longer matters . Because from now on ... you 're free . All your worries about food ... water , shelter ... they 're gone . You live here now . You 'll get everything you need . Now there 's a price you pay for freedom . You do your work . You respect the rules . Violate the rules , you 'll be punished . Try and escape , you 'll be rendered . [ Gun Fires ] Simple security measure . You respect your freedom ... you got nothing to be afraid of . Everybody gets one . - What was that ? - Skull bug . Lives in your head . Harmless until they turn it on . Then it likes to eat . No way they 're putting one in me . You think you 're an exception ? I like to think I am , yeah . Then you 'll get special treatment . Get the hell away from him ! [ Gun Fires ] [ Gun Fires ] [ Gun Fires ] Can I get some water ? Who are you ? It 's okay . I 'm a medic . Don 't touch that man . Let him suffer . He 's Republican Guard . Works for Santiago . What are you talking about ? He used to have a chip . Saw this man burn down my home . Made the whole town run like dogs . Now he 's the one that 's running . - Stay away from him . - Dead man 's got a friend . I 'd watch your step around here ... unless you 've got eyes in the back of that pill-bug head . Don 't worry . He 'll be all right . He 's not a Republican Guard . I know . Neither are you . Name 's Hobbes . I have something to show you . They have no use for the sick . They see you can 't work , they dispose of you . Mom . - What 's wrong with her ? - Cancer . Sleep is her only peace now . If not for you , she wouldn 't have held on . - If not for me ? - I told her you were coming . [ Machine Beeping ] I was relieved to hear she had family coming . We ... We were afraid nobody even knew . - I 'm not family really . I 'm ... - They said you were her daughter . Not exactly . I 'm her son 's fianc√©e . Then he does know . No . I 'm afraid he doesn 't . You 've been filled in on her situation ? Whoever called told me she fell in her kitchen . She had a seizure . We found a tumor in her brain . It looks like a recurrence of a cancer we found and treated five years ago . Is it still treatable ? No . There 's a chance she might not even regain consciousness . We 're talking days , not weeks . It 's good you 're here . How you feeling ? If this ain 't real , how come it hurts so much ? We have to get outta here . I 'm seeing triple . Maybe we could wait until I 'm seeing double . It 's more complicated than that . - How 's that ? - I found my mother . She 's here . Your mother ? She 's very sick . Hobbes , I 've met people here . People I knew in the real world . - It 's her . - No . It just looks like her . Everybody in the world has a copy here . That 's how this whole thing is set up . But they 're just V.C. Files , not people . She recognized me . She knows who I am . She doesn 't know she 's part of some game . She doesn 't know what 's happened to you . She thinks this is all real . She 's in pain ! How different is that from what you feel ? So you 're gonna what , throw her over your shoulder ? It 's gonna be hard enough for us to get out of this place with these bugs in our heads . I 'm not gonna let her die here . And I 'm not getting killed so she can die somewhere else . [ Bell Ringing ] Come on . - What 's happening ? - Shift change . They find you in here after the bell , you 'll be rendered . Nice pictures of you two up in the Big Man 's office . Big Man 's gonna make the connection sooner or later . - You got a problem ? - Only you . I 'll make a mental note . He 's in . [ Prisoner ] A tracker . He 's gonna catch him . Hey ! Hey ! - [ Gun Whirring ] - [ Gasping ] [ Bug Whirring ] [ Mrs. Hobbes ] Tom . Mom ? He told me you were coming . I didn 't believe him . [ Inhales ] I didn 't know how you 'd ever find me . I went by the house . - They took everything . - Doesn 't matter . The important thing is I found you . I can get you out of here . I can 't go , Tom . Look at me . I 'm gonna take care of you . [ Chuckles ] The kind man , he takes care of me . Talks to me . He tells me you 're in love . [ Mrs. Hobbes ] Tom . [ Woman On P.A. , Indistinct ] Tom ? No , it 's Sophie , Mrs. Hobbes . Sophie Green . Can you hear me ? I heard Tom . You 're in the hospital . - He 's not here ? - No . You must have been dreaming . You 've been unconscious . - I have ? - You 've been out for quite some time . I 'd forgotten Tom was dead . Are you in any pain , Mrs. Hobbes ? No . They take care of me . They 're so good to me here . I 'm so glad you 're here , Sophie . I was so thankful when they told me you were coming . When did they tell you ? They talk to me every day ... and put cool towels on my forehead . I know we don 't know each other very well , Sophie ... but you 're the closest thing I have to Tom . I miss him so much . So do I. [ Man Yelling , Indistinct ] [ Man Yelling , Indistinct ] Hurry it up . Somebody 's gonna miss us . And make sure you get that lock back on . - [ Clatters ] - Quiet ! [ Machinery Whirring ] Hobbes . - Check it . - What ? [ Hobbes ] What are they up to ? Something at the pump house . That 's why they attacked me yesterday , to draw attention , so the trackers wouldn 't notice . Whatever it is , they don 't want us or anyone else to know . Yeah , whatever it is , stay out of it . You saw what that bug will do . Then let 's get outta here before they decide to give us a personal demonstration . You go . Get word to Florence . Tell her my mom needs help . - It won 't work , Hobbes . - Why not ? You said your mom had cancer in the real world . It was in her medical records . So when she was scanned into Harsh Realm , the cancer was scanned in too . So Florence can heal her . Florence can only work on what happens here in the game . She can 't take away what 's been written into the code . She can 't heal cancer that 's in the code . [ Bell Ringing ] How 's she doing ? Not so good tonight . There 's fever . It 's good she just sleeps . You 're good to her . But why 'd you tell her I was coming ? It gave her such comfort . But what if I hadn 't come ? The important thing is you did . What happens when she ... Her body will digitize . Disappear . And that 's it ? She just goes away ? That all depends ... on what you believe . Hobbes . Hobbes . What ? They 're making a move . Two guys . Big guy and another one . I think they 're busting out of here . I told you . I 'm not leaving . I 'm trying to save your life . You heard me . Yeah . See ya around . What do you think you 're doing ? I thought I 'd fly standby . You should be thanking me for not ratting on you . That doesn 't mean I gotta let you come . What are you gonna do about it ? That 's what I thought . The tunnel down here leads out . Hey , let go ! No ! Let go of me ! No ! No ! No ! [ Body Thuds ] [ Yells ] [ Body Thuds ] [ Slurping ] He 's had those prisoners in there all night . Doing what ? Trying to get them to rat on me . It 's only a matter of time . Lucky it hasn 't happened already . Where 'd you get that ? Those two there ! Bring ' em here . Who 's gonna tell me a story ? Another prisoner ... tried to escape last night . And you two were missing from the bunks . Who 's gonna come clean ? Two pictures are missing in my office . Now if I find out it 's you ... it 's not gonna matter anyway , right ? Nobody beats my trackers . Nobody escapes my camp . Nobody sneaks ... in my office . Now somebody 's gonna get what 's coming to him . First one of you talks , I might show some mercy . What do you say ? You got the wrong guys . Then I got no choice . [ Gun Whirring ] Wait . Somebody 's still got a good head on his shoulders . Wants to keep it there . I can escape your camp . - What 's that ? - I can beat your tracker . - Nobody can beat a tracker . - I can . This guy here . Lose , you can skull-bug me . - Win ... - There 's no win here , son . Well , then you 've got nothing to lose . Why not sundown ? A flair for the dramatic . [ Chuckles ] - What are you doing ? - Buying time . Till sundown ? You nuts ? It may be all the time my mom has . And then what ? You go one-on-one with Vlad the Impaler ? It 's over , Hobbes . End of game . I was about to get my head drilled . I 'll take my chances . What about my chances ? You came to say good-bye . Shh . Just rest . I just wanted to see how you were doing . I 'm dying , Tom . Look in my eyes . I see such sadness in you . I don 't want you to die . It 's more than that . It 's so complicated . Where 's your girl , Tom ? The one you love . We were separated . I 've been trying to get back to her . You 'll find her . I know you will . [ Sophie 's Voice ] Dear Tom ... I feel time is slipping away . I try to give your mother every comfort , but I feel so helpless . I know now where you get your strength , Tom . But as strong as she is , I feel her letting go . I feel you slipping too . The closeness she feels for you only reminds me ... how dearly I hold on to the little I have left of you . With every look , I see you . And when I lose her , I lose another part of you . I need your help . Please , if he sees me talking to you ... He 's a violent man . - My friend is gonna die . - I helped you already . He 's going up against the tracker . He 's only got a few hours . He can 't beat a tracker . Then tell me what to do . There 's gotta be a way out of here . I wish I could help . I 'm sorry . The other night , what you did ... why help me at all ? This is all I have . Yo , Lurch ! [ Chattering ] [ Gun Whirring ] - [ Tracker Yells ] - [ Pinocchio Grunts ] [ Yelling ] - Tracker ! - [ Whirring ] Finish it ! [ Whirring ] [ Groaning ] What were you thinking ? That was my wager , my deal . You would have lost . I should have lost . I took the only chance we had . You almost died from a fight I chose . Give it a rest , will ya , Hobbes ? Maybe I didn 't do it for you . Ever think of that ? Ow ! Take it easy with that , huh ? How is she ? His mother . She may not make the night . Go on , Hobbes . You oughta be with her . - Thanks . - Don 't thank me . It was the girl who took the risk . Thank her if she 's still alive . [ Yelling In Pain ] - What the hell is it ? - I don 't know . - [ Yelling ] - It 's the bug . Get it out ! Get it out ! Got it . Right here . [ Whirring ] It was trying to back out . The fight must have dislodged it . [ Bell Ringing ] You 're starting to bug me . Come on . Get that bug out of me . [ Gun Whirring , Fires ] You 're living under the mistaken idea that I can 't get someone else ... to come in here and do my laundry . Hey , I didn 't tell you to stop . [ Gasping ] - [ Yelling ] - [ Gun Fires ] Watch him . Please , come with us . You 're very kind , but I cannot leave . Why not ? This is my place . The sick and dying need me . Thank you . [ Truck Engine Starts ] You can 't stay here . It 's okay . I think I 'll have someone draw me a bath . Make it a long hot one . [ Whirring ] It 's okay , Mom . We 're home now . Every night ... I see people ... faces . All my memories coming back to me . Places I remember . [ Inhales ] Mom ? I can see him . - Who ? - Tom . You can see him . Look in my eyes . Sophie . [ Sophie ] Tom ? [ Steady Tone ] She believed . Excuse me ? Do you ? It 's snowing . [ Voices Overlapping ] [ Child ] I made this ! Ripped By mstoll

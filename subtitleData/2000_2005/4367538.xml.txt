 We 're not gonna give up on her , John . I gave you a chance . Where is Crichton ? I don 't know . I 'm gonna need your help , mister Scarran half-breed . Aeryn ... for wormholes . I know why she 's reacting like this . Stop ! Do not interfer . She 's with child . A Scarran heat probe will kill the pregnant Sebacean . Whose child is inside you ? Is it John Crichton 's ? I don 't know . If this is Crichton 's child we could learn all he knows about wormholes from his fetal DNA . Get me out ! Out ! The Scarran border station has given us permission to dock . Moya senses three other vessels present . One is our own transport pod . That means Sikozu made it okay . Getting here is the easy part . She 'll be fine . The Scarrans will just think she 's another Kalish bureaucrat . Yah , I 'm supposed to be a Peacekeeper . I love waiting to see how things go south . All vessels enroute to Katratzi must stop for inspection and quarantine . The procedure takes five solar days . Any vessel lacking the proper security clearance beacon will be destroyed on sight . That 's very reassuring . We ... will find her . We 'll get Aeryn back ... no matter what . Docking completed . Permit staton personnel to board , but monitor them . I understand , Captain Wentrask . Wentrask ? We must assume that all comms transmissions are being intercepted . But our comms are secure . Let 's just pretend they aren 't . Captain Wentrask ? I am Dr. Trayso Talnell , Chief Medical Officer . Yes . Another Kalish functionary . Are these necessary ? Your entire vessel must be checked for contraband and contaminants . We have neither aboard . I should hope not . A ... , Peacekeeper ? How remarkably perceptive . How do you come to have a Peacekeeper aboard ? What gave you the impression I answer to you ? With due respect , Captain , you will either respond to my inquiries or you will be denied entry into Scarran space . Understood ? The Peacekeeper is a spy for the Scarrans . Also on board we have a Nebari and a Hynerian . They are spies as well . The hierarchy ... will not look kindly on a Kalish who obstructs their delivery . Understood ? Do you have anything to eat on board the station ? Refreshments may be obtained in the station commons . Be aware that no weapons are permitted on the station and ... you will be checked . Our sentinels are programmed to shoot and kill any armed visitors . Keep an eye on that . All the visitors you get ... all the fantastic technology you get to work with ... Looks like she 's found a new friend . One of her own kind . Oh ... and not too bad looking at that . Sikozu thinks with her head , not her kuzitza . Yah . That 's her problem . We were smart to send her ahead . The Kalish are definitely running things round here . The Kalish are a conquered species . They serve the Scarrans in order to survive . You mean they 're collaborators . ... Diplomatic missions throughout Tormented Space . You must lead an interesting life . I suppose so . I 'm getting tired of the incessant travel though . I envy you your stable position here . Running the station isn 't stable ... it 's boring . Karohm , your work isn 't boring in the slightest . Maybe we should trade jobs . I must get back . Meet me later . In a while . Got anything to tell me ? Aeryn is here . Say that again . Aeryn is here . Where ? In the Scarran freighter . The Scarran freighter has finished its time in quarantine and is leaving in half an arn . This won 't harm the baby . But it will keep you docile . You see , I could make things so much easier for you . If only you 'd trust me . Half an arn . What can we do in half an arn ? Grab our guns and we kick in some doors . We wouldn 't even pass through this station . The Scarran sentinels are programmed ... to kill any non-station personnel carrying weapons . We have a hole card . D 'Argo and Noranti are hanging back in LoLah . If D 'Argo 's ship attacked a Scarran freighter ... a fleet of Scarran warships would instantly be dispatched after us . Besides , the freighter has Aeryn as a hostage . We have a far greater chance here than at any Scarran military base . Hence we need to keep that freighter here long enough to come up with a plan . Pass me all that food . It 's a hell of a time to be eating , Rygel . I have an idea . Get me more . The freighter will be clear to depart within a quarter arn . Time enough for a refreshment . A Scarran captain ... with a Charrid sidekick just like Sikozu said . Many weaknesses . Povek natrenko . Povek . May we speak . Leave us . Now listen carefully . My name is Captain Wentrask . My mission ... demands absolute secrecy . My proof code is zenark devra zenark prida . Ministry of Dissimulation ? Well , don 't worry , Captain . You have little to fear from me . I have no interest in spies and their ... intricate games . I am Jenek and command a freighter . You have your mission and I have mine . So , as it should be . A half-breed . Of no concern to us . Ready the ship to leave . It 's time . You 're doing good . You 're doin great . Why do you keep on struggling ? You know it won 't do you any good . Must I keep sedating you ? Must you keep making things difficult for yourself ? There 's no point in fighting . You know that . That 's enough . You 're gonna bust a gut . That 's enough all right . Give me a microt . The Sebacean . From the freighter . Sikozu thinks she 's a nurse . Not good . It 's another person you 're got to fool . This will be convincing . Stand back . Hey ... you all right ? Don 't feel well . What 's the matter with him ? Maybe it 's your lousy food . Yes . I 'm sure of it . Have you ever had an emesis of this severity before ? Just once , but they cured it . And , what was the cause ? A touch of dermafollica . That 's a highly contagious disease . Oh , don 't worry . They said it was dormant . We 're in lockdown until further notice . Anchor all vessels to their docking ports . No ... you can 't keep us here . I can , and uh ... I must , uh ... under the quarantine policy of , uh ... your hierarchy . Have you any evidence the Hynerian 's condition poses a risk ? No , but I must err on the side of caution . I 'm unfamiliar with Hynerian Dermafollica . However , I , uh ... have asked the medical database at Simstef for information . They 're transmitting it now . I 've also sent out a request for all vessels in the sector for doctors or healers with any knowledge of the disease . That 's not procedure , but , uh ... under the circumstances , it 's a very good idea . Thanks for suggesting it . I don 't know why everyone 's afraid of a few germs . Yah , me neither . This 'll kill them . These 'll kill anything ! Greetings ! I 'm Trayso Talnell , Chief Medical Officer . Thank you for coming . Utu-Noranti Pralatong , Alleviator and Healer . And this ... is my personal assistant . You may stay here if you choose . Yes , Healer . A Luxan assistant ? Oh , yes . Luxans make fine pilots , exceptional bodyguards and superlative lovers . Data from Stimstef . Thank you . Apparently we 've brought you here for nothing ... Healer . This isn 't Dermafollica at all . Oh , it 's too soon to tell , I 'd say . per this report , he should have exhibited signs of skin sloughing by now . May I see that ? Yes ... well , you see , Dermafollica is very difficult to diagnose . The bacteria that causes the virus is effectively undetectable . Yes , but none of the other symptoms are present . Hence , unless anything else manifests itself in , say ... ohh , an arn , I can safely lift lockdown . I 'm going to examine the patient . And you 're sure that what you had was Dermafollica ? Yes . I barely survived . Four of my wives didn 't . Here . No . Swallow . Was that absolutely essential ? Absolutely . So tell me , do you wannta get outta here ? Well , it 's getting late now . Maybe we should find someplace where we can calm down . Get comfortable . Got a suggestion ? What news , Healer ? None yet . We 'll just have to wait . Maybe you 'd like to go out and see my ship . Is it a very big ship ? Size isn 't as important as speed and maneuverability . Oh yah ? Well , that 's what they all say . Come with me and I 'll prove it . Excuse me . Hey , Nebari girl . How about I buy you a drink ? I was here first . Your point ? Much better . Rygel 's scam seems to be working . So you know . One of the voices on the medical distress transmision was Sikozu 's , so we played along . Smart Luxan . It seems your caution was justified . His skin is sloughing . The lockdown will remain in effect . How contagious is this disease ? It can infect non-Hynerians and those it does infect it kills without warning . Frell that . I 'm gonna lock myself in an airlock . I 'm afraid it 's far too late for that . This virus is so pervasive that ... everyone on this station or any vessels docked to it has already been exposed . So what do we do ? I can attempt to concoct a cure . However , my ship is understocked . I need herbs , medications , healing potions . Do you have any sort of medical supplies ? I mean , even a simple remedy kit wil do . No . No one may board my vessel . I have a facility on board my Leviathan . I offer it for your use . Escort her . Thank you . That was a nice job , Granny . You scammed ' em . I couldn 't scam Trayso . But you did . He believes Rygel 's sick . That 's because I made Rygel sick . No , you made him look sick . No , I made him sick . With what ? Dermafollica . The virus is dormant in his system . I merely reactivated it . Can you deactivate it ? I hope so . And , what if you can 't ? He dies . Are you tekked ? What are you trying to do , what ? Kill Rygel ? No . He won 't die . I can make a cure . You sure about that ? I 'm almost certain . How long has Rygel got ? Plenty of time , if I 'm not disturbed . Is this bug contagious ? Some varieties can be . What about this variety ? I 'll fix it . You 've already fixed it ! You 've ... you 've infected us with the frelling Hynerian plague ! Not infected ... exposed . Anyway , you can 't get it . I can 't ? Nebari are immune , as are Scarrans . And Sebaceans ? Are Sebaceans immune ? No . You 'll kill Aeryn even before we get a chance to save her ! Don 't you say that ! Don 't you dare say that ! I will fix this ! You wanted a plague , I gave you one . Without real symptoms , the lockdown is lifted , Aeryn is on her way to the Scarran base and you ... are frelled . Now , I did what I had to do . I suggest you do the same . You don 't understand . I have a patient I must protect . Your passenger has already been exposed , as have we all . But the facilities on Katratzi are much more likely to have a cure . Oh , so you 'd expose them as well , would you ? Scarrans are immune to this disease . But Kalish aren 't . I won 't be held responsible for loosing ... a virus that could prove catastrophic to my own people . Your vessel isn 't leaving , Captain . The Healer has requested that we allow the patient ... to be moved aboard the Leviathan . Easier to take tissue samples that way . What ? Release the Hynerian from isolation ? Given the pervasiveness of the virus , isolation is pointless . See to it . What in the frelling yotz where you thinking , you madwoman ? You 're a plague ... a withered , three-eyed , bad-smelling pestilence ! You can shout at me later . I 'll be dead later ! You 'll be dead sooner if I don 't devise a remedy . The more you yell ... the more you distract me . Noranti 's is the only possible course , John . And what has it bought us ? Time ! And what are we doing with that time ? Can 't answer that ? Right . That 's why someone 's got to get on that freighter . Sikozu is working on it . If she could access schematics of the freighter ... Schematics are not going to give us Aeryn 's location , her condition , or tell us how many guards there are . Someone has got to go in . You don 't possibly believe that Captain Jenek will give you a tour ? Grasshopper ! You aim too high and Jenek is not the only one with access . Hey ! Sebacean ? What ? You 're Sebacean , right ? Can 't remember the last time I saw a Sebacean woman . It 's got to be at least half a cycle . So ? So ... that 's a long time without companionship . I don 't do aliens . Well , I don 't do Peacekeepers , so why waste your time ? What 's that ? This is something for a special friend . It 's the Sebacean cure for Hynerian Dermafollica . Or a vial of dust . You 're a medical worker , right ? I could let you analyze it ... but as you say , why waste your time ? Where 'd you get that ? I don 't kiss and tell but you can be sure you 're not gettin it anywhere else . Hynerian Dermafollica rarely infects Sebaceans . But when it does , you 're dead before you know it . I hate odds like that ... don 't you ? So ... what do you want for it ? I just want to share . No admittance , Peacekeeper . He 's with me . Give me a microt . So this is your med bay ? Spare bunks . Fun later . Cure now . It 's a dehydrated concentrate , is it not ? Right . Dilute it ten to one , saline . There 's enough there for both of us . No more ? No . Why ? Another Sebacean needs treatment . It 's too bad for them . Aeryn , wake up . Stop . Hold still . Ho ... Hold still . I need to ... I need to unbind this . No , it 's me . I 'm real . Aeryn ! Leave her alone . Don 't do anything stupid . Scarran hierarchy paid good crindars for me . They wouldn 't want their package delivered damaged . He claimed it was a cure for Hynerian Dermafollica . But was it genuine ? No ... it 's a fake . Why the deception ? Cause ... horny . I am ... looking for a Sebacean woman . You attacked me and attempted to release one of the patients . No offense , but she 's sexier than you . What would you have done had you gotten her ? Taken her back to my ship ... frelled her ... made babies . Jenek ! What are you doing to my Peacekeeper ? Your Peacekeeper was aboard my ship ... attempting to recreate . Is that true ? Yah . More or less . If you 'll excuse us ... I will deal with him . I said ... I will deal with him . That 's a hell of a thing . John ... how did you lie to Jenek 's heat probe ? Was it ... Katoya 's training ? Nah , I told him the truth . Just not the whole truth . Aeryn 's in there . We gotta get her out . Sikozu is gathering information which will help us put together a rescue plan . We will free Officer Sun . The Rosrob Center sent us all their data on Dermafollica , but it isn 't much . And I still can 't get a response from the Diagnosans on Coldjen . Frell ! Why don 't you take a rest interval ? I can monitor communications for you . This ... will boost your Hynerian antibodies and cleanse you of the disease . Open . Unfortunately , it won 't cure anyone other than a Hynerian . And that 's a problem ? I mean ... has anyone else contracted the sickness ? No , not as yet . And they may not . But there 's always a chance . Rygel ? Rygel ! Hey , you with the big ship . Hey , you okay ? We may have another victim . Come on . Somebody ? Somebody call the healer . Hey , what 're you doing ? Don 't run away . Get ... It 's okay . It 's all right . It 's okay . We 're ... we 're gonna get the healer . Dermafollica has proven fatal to a Kalish traveler . Captain Jenek requests your presence aboard his vessel . I must find ... this remedy . He may come here if he chooses . No . He wants you to go to him . The healer needs more resources than are available to make a cure . If there 's anything aboard your vessel that would assist ... You must realize we have a common problem . We both have cargo that needs protecting . I 'll solve my own problems . The Scarran freighter is not only docked to the station , but it is tied to its power grid as well . From station control , I can force a power surge that will disrupt the circuits of both the station and the freighter . That 'll knock out the lights , the alarms and those ugly Scarran DRD 's . For how long ? Only until emergency overrides activate ... maybe thirty microts . Okay ... once we rescued Aeryn , we 've got to get Moya off that station . Yes , I think I 've worked out how to bypass the docking locks . You think ? What were you doing with Karohm all this time ? What about the window stickers this joint 's supposed to give out ? Security beacons . We 'll need some . If we rescue Aeryn ... Don 't say ... ' if ' . I 'm sorry . Yes . When we rescue Aeryn , we simply starburst away from Scarran space . What if we starburst deeper into Scarran space ? Or if the freighter takes off with Aeryn ? If the freighter escapes , then we abandon all hope . We abandon all hope of leading long and prosperous lives and we follow the freighter . She 's still learning . You don 't have to use force . I want to find a cure as much as you do . You will find a cure and we will have it first . Nurse ! Assist them . Nurse , didn 't you ... - Check the patient . - I 'll do it . Save your strength . Don 't try to speak . She doesn 't appear to be infected . Neither was my nurse . If she 's infected , can you cure her ? I think I can , given time . The female is pregnant . Her fetus must be saved . Is there a suitable recipient for a transplant ? What ? No ! Anyway , it wouldn 't do any good . All the females here are equally at risk from this disease . What about the Nebari girl ? Nebari are immune . Go to the Leviathan and bring back the Nebari . We can 't take our weapons through the station . Then take a transport pod and board from the outside . Hey . Get out of my way , fek-face . Get up . Get up ! Guard the door . Get your frelling hands off me ! They took Chiana by force and you just let them ? I was unaware until it was too late to prevent it . Recriminations can wait . We must act . Are you ready ? As the doctor said , save your strength . Oh ... we can 't let them . It won 't happen . I won 't let it happen . They can 't do it without Chiana and they won 't find her . Bring her . Prepare for the procedure . What the frell 's going on ? I 'll sedate her . No ! No , stop . Stop ! This is wrong ! This patient has been drugged . She is weak . She may die from this procedure . I don 't care . My only concern is for the safety of the fetus . - Trayso - Please Proceed . Hold still . No . No . What are you giving her ? Something to ease the pain . She doesn 't need anesthetizing . Give it to the Nebari girl instead . No , I won 't ! This is the patient who needs anesthe you 're not going to cut ... Get that thing frelling away from me ! Very strong . She 'll make an excellent host . She had better . If the fetus dies , so will the both of you . Captain Jenek . Captain Wentrask is in the station commons . He demands an urgent word , sir . Does he ? Very well . Ralnahk . What do you want , Wentrask ? I require ... your cooperation . But you can 't compel it . Jenek ... I know that your prisoner is the Peacekeeper Aeryn Sun ... and that you are taking her to Katratzi for Minister Ahkna . I also know that if my mission fails , your mission becomes irrelevant , as do you . Continue . Step back . I ... was just checking to see if some more med ... Someone 's been downloading the station codes and schematics . It had to be you ... but I 'm disappointed . You know this can 't succeed . We 'll kill them both and the fetus as well . No choice but to try ! What the hell is taking so long ? The lights should be out by now . The procedure 's success depends upon the swift transfer of the fetus . Therefore , we should open both subjects simultaneously . I 'll go check it out . Right . Listen to me , Karohm . Two , possibly three females are being held against their will on the Scarran freighter . Halt . Prepare to begin . They pose the Scarrans no threat . Their imprisonment is completely unjust . I believe you . Then will you help me ? Of course not . I 'm going to lock you up . How wrong was he ? Okay ... now can you do what you said you were gonna do ? Dr Trayso in my opinion this patient 's body is overstressed . Therefore , the fetus will be debilitated . I think ... we should let her regain her equilibrium before we begin the procedure . - We don 't have time ! What you fail to realize is ... that Ahkna 's only interest in your prisoner is as a means to the possible information that John Crichton possesses . Now my Peacekeeper defector can give you John Crichton himself . Now which mission ... do you think is more vital ? All right . That 's unlocked the docking ports on Moya , on your ship and my transport pod . Now for the power grid ... Are these the security beacons ? Yes . There are three lives here and I will not ... Dr Pralatong , I beg you ! Show time . Praloch frenek . Praloch frenek . Karohm , what 's going on ? Stand here . Ohh ! Stop ! I 'll kill her ! I 'll cut her throat ! He wouldn 't dare . If the baby dies , Jenek 'll burn him dead , so shoot . I 'll do it . I 'll kill her . Kalish are supposed to be smart . Who do you think I believe ? All right . Shoot me . You should have killed him . My body count 's already too high . The release is over here . Ready ? Do it . Check the ship . Yes , I must check mine . No . You stay here . Are you done ? Almost . If I jam the docking port controls , the freighter won 't be able to break free and follow us . How 'd you do that ? I ... it was nothing . I ... I merely cross-coupled the emergency by-pass conduits ... . let 's go . Quickly ! Emergency power will come on any microt ! Stop ! Drop the weapon . Turn off that light . Granny , do what he says ! Back to our vessel . You work for the Scarran , right ? Yes . Why ? Security is tight for visitors so you shouldn 't be carrying . Carrying what ? A gun . D 'Argo , please ! Please help her . Ralnaht , report . I 'm fine . You can put me down ... at least for now . Pilot ! What 's our status ? Moya is free of the docking collar . Reactivate all starburst systems . Done . Who are you , and what is your mission ? Pilot ? Any communication from Scorpius ? No . Nor is he responding to the comms . Lo 'Lah and our transport pod have also been released from their ports . Okay , well bring them aboard with the docking web . What about Scorpius ? Well , he might 've been captured ... Or killed . We can only wish . Pilot , starburst as soon as you can . We are leaving . Preparing for starburst . Why doesn 't she ever listen ? It 's all right . Aeryn ! It 's all right . You 're here . Is this real ? It 's real . You 're on Moya . You 're safe . What about the baby ? The baby 's fine . Everything 's gonna be okay . Sleep . Stay . You don 't look as bad . I 'm fine . Thanks for asking . You nearly killed me . No I didn 't . But I did kill others . By my actions ... I have taken innocent lives . Welcome to Moya . In my time as Dominar , some of my actions resulted in the deaths of the undeserving . Even when the cause is just , it 's a hard thing to accept . I must seek forgiveness from the Divine Eternal . I can 't help you there , but I can extend you my forgiveness . No ! Harvey ? You 're not dead . Of course not . I am the ... undead . It 's not funny . The son-of-a-bitch said he took you out of my head . Scorpius , he upgraded me to ... Harvey two point oh . One of my many improvements ... utter loyalty to Scorpius . That 's not an improvement . Oh , but it is . His course is the correct one ... eliminate Scarran threat . You know I don 't give a damn about his agenda . You must ... go back for him . Go back to sleep before I drive a stake through your heart . He knows everything you know , John . What did you say ? I said , Scorpius knows everything you know , John . What ... did you say ? I said , Scorpius knows everything you know . Meaning what ? Another new feature . Scorpius can hear me . Well ... I 've been sharing the contents of your head with him ... memories , thoughts , dreams ... wormhole technology ... No ... you 're lying . ... and eventually they will torture the information out of him and everything they all wanted to know about wormholes will be theirs ... courtesy of John Crichton . Leave me alone ! No ! Hey ... it 's all right . You have to go back for Scorpius . Tell her John , tell her ! You must rescue Scorpius . Tell her !

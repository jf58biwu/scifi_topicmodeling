 Previously on The 4400 : We 're not sure what 's just happened . There appears to be something out there . The light is gone and thousands of people have just suddenly appeared . Diana Skouris , Tom Baldwin . You two will be one of the teams that 's responsible for investigating what happened to the returnees . We 're letting them go . We 're letting them go ? You don 't have a legal right to hold them . Dennis Ryland , I 'm Warren Lytell . I believe Home Sec in D.C. mentioned I was coming . I 'm here to clean up your mess . The hell you are . Now , there 's gonna be a change around here . You can either be part of it , or you can get swept aside . I intend to provide a safe haven for any 4400 in this country who needs one . You 'll be our first official residents . You know I 'm in love with Richard , right ? Why would I try to break up you and Richard ? long as you 're on the job , I feel safe , and so does the baby . Two happy residents . That 's a start . what ' bout Maia Rutledge , age eight , disappeared in ' 46 . And there 's all these reports of her making predictions , ones that come true . Next thing you know , she 's been removed from quarantine by one of our field agents . I 'm afraid you can 't bring Maia back to school anymore . We have to consider the safety of the other students . - It 'll be okay . - No , it 's not okay . Somebody 's coming who 'll make everything better . Next case , Shawn Farrell , age 17 . Disappeared in April of 2001 . It 's a little thin . Me breaking up with Danny has nothing to do with you . Okay . I need to ask you a few questions about Kyle Baldwin . I don 't know what happened . I put my hands on him , that 's it . He woke up . Don 't touch me ! You 're my father . I recognize you , but I don 'know who you are . What are you doing , buddy ? I 'm looking . For what ? For me . I finally understand . They 're not the strangers . I am . I 'm not Kyle Baldwin . Kyle ? I 'm not Kyle . Well , then who are you ? I don 't know . I need more screens . Okay . Your son is experiencing a severe dissociative disorder . Now , it 's not uncommon for newly awakened coma patients . He feels disconnected from his memories , his personality . Yeah , well , we knew when he woke up there 'd be a period of adjustment , but the kid doesn 't even know who he is . I know this is frustrating for you and Linda , but you did the right thing bringing him back here . Yeah . So what now ? More tests ? We need to do another cranial MRI . They 'll be here in an hour to take him back downstairs . Look , I know this is difficult , Tom . But Kyle 's come this far . We can 't give up now . I think I 've got the exact change . Hello , cutie . Thanks . How long have you known that man ? Tony ? Oh , about two years . He 's nice . He 's very nice . Why do you say that ? He 's going to fall in love today . Tony ? My God , good for him . It 's not with me , is it ? Nope . Yeah , I didn 't think so . Is there something else , Maia ? How long am I going to be like this ? Like what ? I don 't want to know things before they happen . I want to be normal , like I used to be . It 's gonna be okay , sweetie . Besides , I mean , you know , who 's normal anyway ? You are . Ha . You want to know a secret ? Normal people , like me ... they just wish they were special like you . The television , put it back on . Kyle , when you came home , you spent all that time looking through your books . Then the maps , now the TV . Why don 't you tell us what you 're looking for , huh ? Maybe we can help you look , too . You should go home and get some rest . I 'm not leaving him . All right . I 'll go grab some stuff . I 'll be back in a half hour , okay ? Mm-hmm . What are you doing ? Mrs. Baldwin ... You leave him alone ! Who are you people ? I 'm calling security . That won 't be necessary . My name is Agent Warren Lytell . I work with your husband . I don 't give a damn who you work with . Leave him alone ! Tell Tom I figured it out . I know where I have to be . Mrs. Baldwin , don 't worry . He 's gonna be safe . The government 's gonna be supervising his medical care from now on . * So long ago * * Another life * * I can feel your heartbeat * * It 's not a dream * * Remember us * * I can see it in your eyes * * We 'll find our place in time * * Our place in time beyond the sun * * We 'll find our place in time * * Our place in time to call our own ... * You snatched that kid from a hospital ? What were you thinking ? ! He 's the only witness to an abduction . He could have some valuable information . Kyle Baldwin can 't remember his own name . Then we 'll help him remember . His mother 's upset . It 's understandable . The family 's been through a lot . But D.C. sent me here to get some result ... Tom ! Where 's my son ? Whoa . Get your hands off me , Baldwin . I swear to God . I 'll ask you one more time . Ryland , you want to give me some help ? It 's a tough call . Where 's Kyle ? ! All right , Tom . You made your point . Put the gun away . Dennis , Dennis . Tom , put the gun away . You should have let me pull the trigger . Don 't think I wasn 't tempted But shooting Lytell is not gonna get Kyle back . Maybe not , but it 'd make me feel a hell of a lot better . Damn it ! What I don 't understand is why Kyle ? Why didn 't they go after Shawn ? Because our doctors have been over Shawn dozens of times . Kyle 's new territory for ' em . New territory ? That 's my son you 're talking about . You think I don 't know that ? Can 't you call D.C. ? What in the hell good would that do ? It was D.C. that put Lytell here the first place . They 're backing his play . So what then ? We do nothing ? I didn 't say that . We 'll get Kyle back . When ? For Christ 's sake , I don 't know . I just heard an hour ago . I don 't know where Lytell put him . No , not good enough , Dennis . No . I 'm not gonna sit around while you play phone tag with some Beltway bureaucrat . I 'm getting my son . Hey , Tom . Get your hands off me . Tom ! We go back a long way . If you try to go around me on this , none of it matters . I know . Tom , what the hell happened between you and Lytell ? Ask Ryland . Tom . Tom ! What ? ! If you 're in trouble , I need to know . Why ? 'Cause I might be able to help . Diana , just stay out of it , all right ? Drive the car . Blood work looks fine . The Rh factor levels are normal , and your calcium 's okay . So , how do you feel , Lily ? A little tired sometime Well , that 's to be expected . Now , where was I ? Oh , right . I 'm gonna have to draw some more amniotic fluid . Why ? Is something wrong ? What kind of genetic anomaly ? All I know is she wants to grow one of the baby 's chromosomes in the lab . It 'll be okay . It 's gonna be a beautiful 18 holes . Either of you play golf ? Oh , I 'm afraid not . That 's too bad . Listen , Jordan , about that doctor you sent us to . Roxanne Kern . She 's the best OB-GYN in the Pacific Northwest . You 're in good hands . So , how 'd that support group meeting go the other night ? Yeah , it , it went well . Thank you . Nobody complained about the catering ? I have to admit the , um , lobster sushi was a great idea . You see ? You just have to trust me . This girlfriend of yours has quite an imagination . She actually thought I was trying to steal her away from you . You believe that ? Uh , not really . I like your confidence . You see ? You were worried about nothing . I wasn 't worried . * Oh ... yeah , three to one * * Lights , camera , transaction ... * We 've got to tell him . I 'll do it . It should be me . When ? Soon . I can 't take all this sneaking around . Besides , I miss seeing you . I miss you , too . * Come one , come all into 1984 ... * Yeah , but you suspected that Shawn had these abilities from the day of his coming home party , and you never told me . I ... Thanks for sharing . I never told Linda , either . Yeah , but you 're divorcing Linda - I 'm your partner . Yeah , I know . When we were first assigned to the 4400 , you were calling them disease vectors and viruses . I know what I was calling them , but have you noticed any change in me lately , maybe because , I don 't know , I have one of them living in my apartment ? All right , point taken . Because if the situation were reversed , I would have told you . I know . I heard you , all right ? Can we continue the reprimand later ? - Fine . - Fine . Now , what are we gonna do about Kyle ? We ? Of course , we . We are gonna go find him and bring him home . Then we 'd better get to work . I 'm sorry Mr. Collier 's not available right now . I 'll have him return your call as soon as he gets in . Thank you , Dr. Kern . Dr. Kern , the OB-GYN ? Mm-hmm . Jordan about to have a baby ? I wouldn 't know . Ah . Here 's the , uh , security logs he asked to see . I 'll put them on his desk . Can I see Jordan 's phone logs for the last couple of weeks ? What for ? He 's been receiving some threatening mail . Uh , I want to cross check it with all his incoming calls . It doesn 't leave this office . Sorry , Mr. Tyler . She can 't be disturbed . Mr. Tyler , please . This won 't take long . Dr. Kern ... I told him you were busy . Lily isn 't scheduled for another appointment today , is she ? No , she isn 't . I want to know why you call Jordan Collier every time she comes see you . My phone habits don 't really concern you , Mr. Tyler . That 's just it - I think they do . And you 're gonna tell me what Jordan Collier knows about Lily 's baby that she doesn 't . Sickle-cell anemia ? How can my baby have the trait for sickle-cell anemia ? Unless the father is black . Maybe he is . What are you saying , Richard ? Oh , I don 't know . Maybe whoever took us used me as some kind of ... donor . The question is , why would Jordan have Dr. Kern keep this from us ? This baby 's carrying the sickle-cell trai .. that brings you and I closer together Maybe he doesn 't want that to happen . Maybe . I think it 's time me and him have a talk . Michelle Hickock , returnee number 938 - she 's coming in this afternoon at 4 : 00 for a counseling session , and I want to see her afterwards , okay ? He 's logged on . Lytell 's on the network . You 're good to go . Tom really appreciates your helping him . I 'm not doing it for Tom . Come on ... Hey . So Kyle 's being held at the Quarantine Center , building nine , subbasement three . That 's great . I owe you . Okay , well ... Marco . Thanks for your help . No worries . All right , you ready to roll ? I think we should wait till after 5 : 00 when the night shift comes on . That way , at least they 're half staffed . Okay , I 'll pick you up at 4 : 00 . See you . Here . This is the place . It 's just outside of the city in West Bellevue . How do you know the guy selling it isn 't gonna be there ? He 's in Spain for three months . Another realtor told me . It 'll make a perfect safe house . Okay , get it set up . And make sure you 're not followed on the way there . You think I 'm being watched ? Well , if I was Lytell , I 'd keep an eye on you . Just remember to check your rearview mirror and stay cool . I remember what you taught me . I just never thought I 'd have to use it . You 'll do fine . I 'll get Kyle , and I 'll meet you out there . I 'll be waiting . - And be careful . - I will . Nice , huh ? I remember how much you told me you like moonstones . I do . But I-I can 't accept these . Why not ? I mean , I got them for you . Come on , Nikki . Look , I know I messed up . Didn 't Shawn talk to you ? Shawn . What does he have to do with anything ? Come on . Nikki ? * It 's been a while * * Since I could call you ... * Hey , Dawn . Hey . - Maia ready ? - Maia 's over by the playground talking with one of your colleagues . Some of the clothes look funny , and the cars . But I don 't know , video games are kind of fun . Did you like the video games in the rec room at Quarantine ? There are so many people , I hardly ever got a chance to play . Lytell ! What are you doing here ? Just talking with Maia . I 'd heard so much about her , I thought it was time we met . Stay away from her . That 's not really your call , now , is it ? Maia , it was nice talking with you . We 'll do it again soon . I don 't like him . And he doesn 't really like me , either . Well , don 't you worry about him . Are you sure ? Oh ... you listen to me , Maia . I am absolutely sure . I am not gonna let anything bad happen to you , you hear me ? All right ? Okay . Jordan , you have a minute ? I know why you 're here . Roxanne Kern called me as soon as you left her office . Look , Richard , I hope you and Lily aren 't blowing this up into something bigger than it is just ' cause some doctor 's trying to land on the good side of my checkbook . Lily and I appreciate everything you 've done for us , from the house to my job . Our lives have been a lot more comfortable since we met . You 're gonna hurt me now , aren 't you ? But we think it 's time you back off and let us run our own lives . Whatever you want . Tell Lily I said hi , will you ? I 'll do that . You good to go ? Just give me a sec . Gloria , just remember what I told you . Don 't answer the door to anyone you don 't know , okay ? Cool . - You leaving now ? - Yeah , but don 't worry , sweetheart , 'cause I 'll be back before you wake up , all right ? Okay . All right . There you go . Bye . Diana . Don 't worry . You 'll find him . Find who ? Your son , Kyle . He 's the answer . The answer to what ? Everything . I want to see , uh , Kyle Baldwin , please . You 're not on the authorization list . Oh , no , no , I 'm just a friend of the family , and I want to know that he 's all right . 'Cause he 's not even one of the 4400 , and his father works with me at Intec , and I don 't know , if you could just give me something that I could tell him . 'Cause ... come on , we 're both supposed to be on the same side , right ? I 'll see what I can find out . Oh , great . Thank you so much . That 's great . It 's all right , you won 't even have a headache when you wake up , okay ? Oh , well , maybe a little headache . Come on in . Kyle , buddy . It 's me , buddy , okay , huh ? Huh ? Highland Beach . Yeah , what about it ? That 's where I have to go . Highland Beach ? Let 's get you out of here first , okay ? Come on , up . Okay ? We got him , Linda . Yeah . No , he 's sitting right here next to me . He 's about the same . No worse , anyway . I 'll see you in a little while . How far away is the safe house ? It 's about 30 miles . Your mom 's waiting for you , buddy . No . Highland Beach . Hey ! Kyle ! No , let go . Kyle , Kyle , stop ! Highland Beach ! Kyle , let go , Kyle ! Back off ! Calm down ! We have to go there . We have to go there now . What 's at Highland Beach ? That 's where Shawn disappeared . I have to go back there . Just , just calm down , buddy . Just ... If that 's what you want , we 'll-we 'll take you . You sure about that ? Kyle 's the answer , right ? Two of your agents are operating outside of the tent . I noticed . Do you know why ? Because you pulled the Baldwin kid out of the hospital . Yeah , well , D.C. wouldn 't see it that way . D.C. thought it was a good move to send you here . Well , you gonna bring him in or not ? Find him . So , these are the names of the people who are coming to the next support group meeting . It 's a little bigger than the last one , so we may need a couple more tables . I 'll take care of it . Thank you . Lily ? Can I see you for a minute ? Um , I-I have a few errands to run . it won 't take long . Where 'd you get this ? I 've been doing security checks on everyone who 's moved into the complex . Well , don 't look shocked , Lily . I mean , consider my position . A lot of people , including half my own board of directors would love to see me fall on my face here . A scandal like this would give them the last bit of leverage they need to force me out of the company and put themselves back in power . Richard would never do anything like this . I 'd have thought so , too . I guess we were both wrong . Do you really think this is gonna change the way I feel about him ? That 's up to you . But , Lily , you really have to ask yourself ... is this the man you want raising your baby ? Aren 't you gonna say something ? It was my 23rd birthday . A bunch of guys from the barracks invited me out to a bar . You don 't drink . Didn 't then , either . But these guys - it was a big deal they asking me to come along . In those days , Negroes and whites didn 't do much socializing . So , I went . It was kind of nice , you know . Then this ... woman started coming on to me . People started staring . So ... I figured it was time for me to get out of there . She followed me outside and asked me to go home with her . I declined respectfully . That 's when she started screaming . That 's it ? That 's all that happened ? That 's all it took in 1945 . Because the statement the woman made to the police - I mean , it 's so detailed . Lily , none of it 's true . If I hadn 't been completely exonerated of those charges , do-do-do you think the Air Force would-would have sent me to flight school ? Made me an officer or a pilot ? The woman lied . The charges got dropped . Why would Jordan bring any of this up ? He wants you to start doubting me ... doubting us . Do you ? We got to pack whatever we can in five minutes . We 're getting out of here . They 're heading west on Sandberg . There are no freeways in that direction . Highland Beach . I bet that 's where they 're going . Have my car brought around . I 'm coming . I don 't care what the hell you do . Just keep your mouth shut and stay out of my way . Come on , Mom are you serious ? The movies- - like , you and me ? Is that so weird ? I mean , we used to go to the movies all the time . Well , when I was six . Shawn ! You prick . Get ... Oh ! Danny . listen to me . You goddamned freak ... ! Danny , stop this ! Boys , please ! Danny Shawn , stop ! Please ! Goddamn it , stop blaming me for Nikki ! Don 't you see it 's over between you two ? ! That 's enough ! Danny ? ! Shawn , stop it ! You 're killing him ! What did you do ? I don 't know . I didn 't mean to do anything . Danny ? Get away from him ! Shawn ? What happened ? I heard you guys shouting . Don 't touch me . What ? Don 't touch me . Ah . You 're the only good thing that 's happened to me since I 've been back . But I can 't stay here , and you can 't come where I 'm going . Shawn . I love you , Nikki . I love you . What are you doing ? Shawn ? What ... No . Stay here and talk about this . Shawn ? Shawn , what are you doing ? ! Shawn ! What 's all this ? What 's it look like ? Have you two thought about what you 're doing ? I mean , really thought about it ? Because let me remind you , it is dangerous outside those gates . We 'll risk it . Lily , think about the baby . What does the baby have to do with this ? Everything . That baby could be the key to the future , and it has to be protected , and I can do that , better than Richard , better than anyone . Lily , get in the car . I 'm afraid I can 't let you do that . Stay away from her . Oh , God . Oh , God , God ... Go ahead , run ! It won 't do you any good . I will find you . That baby belongs with me . Kyle . Damn it , Kyle , we 've been walking for ten minutes . What are you looking for ? Maybe we can help you , Kyle . This was where we found him . We 're running out of time . Kyle , I brought you here like you asked . But if there 's something you need to do , you better do it fast . I belong here . I tried really hard . And no matter what I 've done , which way I 've turned , it just ... It sucks . I need to clear my head and get away for a while . I guess what I 'm asking is if I could stay here for a while . Shawn , you 're one of the 4400 . As far as I 'm concerned , you can stay here as long as you want . That 's great , man , thanks . Thank you . So , um , tell me a little more about this ability of yours . Any idea where we 're headed ? I 'll know it when I see it . He 's gonna come after us . Baby likes that . You know , it really wouldn 't be so bad , would it ? If you were the father ? No , it wouldn 't be bad at all . That 's their car . Let 's go . Now listen , these are not criminals here . These are two of our own . I want you to keep your gun holstered . There 's no cause for anybody to get hurt . Kyle , they 're coming for you . They 're gonna want to take you away . They 're too late . Kyle . Kyle ! Don 't ! Kyle . Tom . You 're not my son , are you ? No . Kyle was meant to be a channel ... a way to communicate . Communicate with who ? With you . To guide you in your dealings with the returnees . But something went wrong . Shawn interrupted the process . That 's what put him in a coma . He was like that for three years because of you . Tom . Who are you ? What are you ? I 'm human . Like you . No , you 're nothing like me . I come from a different time . That is all . Your future . Is that where you took them ? My nephew and , and all the others ? We needed them . For what ? To survive . Skouris . In my time , humanity is dying out . You mean , it 's all going to end ? Everything ? What in the hell is going on ? I don 't know . Kyle brought us out here . It 's like he knew it was gonna happen . Did you ever think that maybe he 's not Kyle Baldwin ? He kept claiming he wasn 't . Maybe he 's telling the truth . Hey , Tom . Tom , are you all right ? We can 't just stand around . We got to do something . He could take Baldwin with him or kill him . Hey , nobody is going to do anything until we know what 's going on in there . Only those we took can prevent the catastrophe from happening . That 's why they 've been altered and seeded back into the timeline . But why here ? Why now ? 'Cause history tells us this is where the path to oblivion began . And-and the people you took ? They 're going to stop that from happening - how ? They 've already begun their work ... and you 've begun yours . Tom , come on . Do something , Ryland , or I will . That 's it . I need you out of there . I don 't understand . What ... what is their work ? What are we supposed to do ? You have to help them . Help them ? How ? How ? You 're bleeding . Oh , God . G-Get an ambulance . Now ! Kyle ... Kyle , no , Kyle , Kyle , Kyle , Kyle , Kyle , Kyle ! Stay-stay with me , stay with me , Kyle . Stay with me . Just stay with me . Look at me , look at me , look at me , Kyle . Stay here , stay here . No , no , no ... Kyle ... Kyle ... Kyle , look at me , look at me . Stay with me Kyle , stay with me . Stay with me , come on . Stay with me . No . Come on , come on . No ... No ... no , no ! Tom . Dad ? Kyle ? What are you doing here ? Where 's - where 's Shawn ? Kyle ? Oh , I-I can explain about the beer . No . I-I ... Oh , forget the beer . You don 't have to explain anything . What 's going on ? Tom . Tom , what did you see ? I got you . The baby . It 's time ? Mm . I 'll get the car .

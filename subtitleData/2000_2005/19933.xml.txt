 Here you go , my friend . Make sure you go as close as you can , I 'll get you something extra if you make it a good trip . I 'm going to get you close , my friend . But not too close . You know what I mean ? Are you ready ? - Ready ! - Ready ! 1 , 2 , 3 ! Are you scared ? This is great ! You see anything yet ? No ... Not yet . What was that ? I don 't know . - Hold on . - What 's happening ? Hold on . Make it stop . What happen to them ? I don 't know . - We 're gonna crash . - No , we are not . We 're gonna crash . I 'm going to take this tools . Let go the rope . Let go the rope ! Move your hands . Come on . Keep ... Let go ! It 's gonna be okay . Actually Charlie that doesn 't hurt . They won 't really be fighting each other . But these one here are Corythosaurus . They really like fighting with each other . They use their teeth and their claws to rip each other 's jaws out . Alan , he 's three . Let 's wait until he is five . Right . Sorry , Charlie . - Ellie . - Yes . It 's Tom again . He says he has to talk to you about the last chapter . Just tell him I am not gonna to lose the Jack Corner Club . Hey , look who 's here ? This is Alan . Nice to meet you , Alan . Daddy . This is Hylaeosaurus . That 's the dinosaur man . Dinosaur man ? Jack , say my name . is my name Alan ? is my name Alan ? He used to know me . Here you go . Thanks . So you know Mark is going to work with the State Department now . What do you do , Mark ? It 's international relation most . Somethings like that . I 'll get her . You guys ... You guys have a little chat . He 's a great guy . So what are you working on now ? Raptors mostly . My favourite . Do you remember the sounds they made ? I try not . Ellie , all the theories are about raptors intelligence , what are they capable of ? We work even close . Tell me . We did plenty of scan on the raptors skeleton . We find out it looks like a very sophisticated resonating chamber . Wait a second . So we were right ? I mean they had even living vocalise . I 'm convince they had the key of social intelligence . Which explains why they work together as a team . And co-ordinate they attacks . And they probably know what is going on . They could talk to each other . To agree , we could never imagine . Ellie , they were smart . They were smarter than dolphins or whales . They were smarter than primates . I just want to say I 'll be ready to help with anything . Someday if you want to ask , you can call me . Anything . Anytime . Sure . You 're still the best . I mean it . The last in my breed . So the basic study about the interior chamber , and most of these specimens . They begin to determine the exciting color relation between the upper-pales and the leerings . This lead us theorise the raptors . Which are capable of sophisticated vocalizations which were had been tremendous evolutionary advantange . Raptors were fierce , intelligent and socially sophisticated . They were able to hunt in numbers and co-ordinate their efforts . With the catadysmic advance which overtook them it 's entirely possible that raptors or humans whether to become a dominant species on this planet . I hope this has been interest . It certainly excites us as it 's intelligence . There is much more to discover . That is why we continue to need and ask for your support . Thank you . Thank you very much , Dr Grant . Now , does anyone have a question ? Fine . Does anyone have a question that is not related to Jurrasic Park ? All the incident in San Diego which I did not witness . Yes , sir . Your theory on raptors is good . But isn 't it a conjecture kind of mood ? I mean once the UN in Costa Rica and everyone decides how to handle that second island , scientists will just go in and look for themselves . Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago . What is left of them is fossilise in the rocks . And this in the rock , that real scientists make real discovery . Now what John Hammand and lngen in the Jurassic Park is created genetically engineered theme park monsters . Nothing more and nothing less . Are you saying that you don 't want to get to Isla Sorna and study them if you have the chance ? No force on earth or heaven . Forget beyond that island . So what we got here ? 20 million gas operator sending out in a minute . Gunship , magazine , third routine and both our clothes cope with reducing muscles ... Here , Udesky . Yes , sir . We are going to get here . The matter of fact is you knock things down as soon as you bought me that thing . Well , that 's right . There are two of the best man that I would find . No , sir . I 've not worked with them personally . But believe me , sir . These men come very highly recommended . Nothing to worry about , sir . It 's going to be walk in park . Billy , I don 't think that I 'm doing this right . Let 's try to do first . You got to do this slowly . It 'll just take a little bit of time . I can never tell what 's rock and what 's bone . Technically it 's all rock . But calcium in the bones replace during fossilisation . You can feel the difference , see . Rough ... smooth ... Dr Grant ! Mr Brennan . So how did it go ? It 's not too late to change your major , Billy ! Worse , we gonna have backup in four weeks . I have to run some equipment . I got to show you something . You like computers , right I like the abacus , Billy . Meet the future of paleontology . It 's a rapid photo type . I scanned them from the raptor skeleton . If the computer breaks down a thousand of slices . And this thing scoops it . One layer at a time . It 's done . I give you the resonating chamber of velociraptor . Listen to this . This is brilliant , Billy . All I have to say , it 's just a little bit too late . Grant , Paul Kirby . Kirby Enteprise . My card . How are you doing , Billy . ? What can I do for you , Mr Kirby ? Well , the first thing , I 'm a great admirer of yours . And I have a proposition and I would like to discuss with you . Would you have dinner with me and my wife this evening ? It 'll be our treat . That will be great , but ... I 'm tired , I have been travelling . Maybe some other time . Believe me . This will be worth you a while . We love to . Terrific . That 's the spirit . Good . See you this evening then . - Billy . - How are you ? So what are you boys drinking ? - Ice peak cap . - Two please . We admire your work for years . Really truly inspiring . Amanda and I just love the outdoors . We have been on just every adventure that can come up with . The Neil and everything . We even have two seats reserved on the first commercial flight to the moon . And for the wedding anniversary this year , we like to do something really special ... - Something ... - Once in a lifetime . I 've charged an airplane to fly us Isla Sorna . And we like you to be our guide . There you go , guys . This is a very kind offer , Mr Kirby . I 'm a very very busy man . I can recommend a couple of guys who is highly qualified that ... No . No . You are the best . You 'd seen these animals in the flash . There is even one comes close to you . You won 't be able to fly enough low to see anything that is really interesting . That 's the interesting part . Because we have the permission to fly low . How low ? Haven 't issue yet . But I can fly lower than anybody else . I can tell you . From what I understand , I understand ... This is what we want . You see , through my business dealing , import and export . Emerging market . I have a lot of friends in high level . In that case , Costa Rica we can go in . Dr Grant , you have no idea how this important to us that you come along . This will be all the difference . Mrs Kirby , I ... And of course we love to make a contribution to your research here . I can write all kind of numbers on this check , Dr Grant . Tell me . What 's this gonna take ? No way . This one is lucky . A couples years ago , some parties in lsland hand gladding these cleaves in museum . And it 's big up draught come in and swipe me right across the sign . Wham ! Well , it does sound like . This strap saved my life . I got hook on the rock when I was falling . Survivor are the most idiotic . Alan , thank you for bringing me along . The bones will still be there when you get back . This is the great thing about bones that they don 't run away . The truth is , you got me into this . I 've no intention of being on my own with these people . Don 't get too excited , Billy . Chances are once here think . Good time to be nice . Awake me when we get there . So how do you know the Kirbys ? Through our church . Ellie ... Ellie ! Here we go , we 're almost there . You 're approaching Isla Sorna . Do you want to approach ... My God. I 've forgotten . We did it , honey . We are here . If you see anything , yell up . I thought of keep it to myself . I 'm sorry . Everyone , if you could look out the left of the plane . You can see a whole curf of Brachiosaurus . In fact you could see the front of the group alpha male grazing there . Udesky , Nash . How about the front ? You guys see anything ? Nothing yet , Mr Kirby . Mrs Kirby , look . Out here you 'll see a group of Triceratops ... Mr. Kirby , we have to land in strip down ahead . You want me to put it down ? No . No . I told you on a circle to see the whole island . You have been set down . We can 't land here . What are you talking about ? - Hold on , I can explain . - You cannot land on this island . It 's gonna be fine . Everybody sit down . Would you please sit down ... Tell me we didn 't land . I think they are looking for someone . Dr Grant , are you alright ? I 'm sorry we have to be so ... Who hit me ? That will be cooper . What are they doing ? They are setting up a parameter . Then we could play safe . These guys are good . Trust me. ln this island , there is no such thing as safe . We must get back to that plane . Could you ask your wife stop making up that noise ? That is a very , very bad idea . Amanda ! Ben ! Amanda , honey , Dr Grant says that is a bad idea . What ? He says it 's a bad idea ! What 's about idea ? What was that ? It 's a tyrannosaurus . I don 't think so . It sounds bigger . We have to leave . We have to leave now ! What 's going on ? Where is the professional who can handle this ? It 's alright . We 're just circled the island . Stop ! What is he doing ? That 's Cooper . Stop ... No one can stop this plane . Are you okay ? We 're okay up here . Everyone just stay put . Mayday ! Mayday ! Who has a satellite phone ? I do . I got it right here . Come and get it . The radio is gone . We haven 't landed yet . Damn it . " The number you call is busy " . What was that ? What is it ? What ? - What ... - Hold it ! Hang on , everyone . Help me ! Mrs Kirby , come back ! Amanda ! Follow me ! In here ! I think we lost him . It 's okay. lt 's dead . Nobody move a muscle . No ... No ... No ... Please don 't . Stop . Please . It 's time you do some explain , Mr Kirby . We called everyone . We did verything we could . No one would help us . The Costa Rica goverment said this is no fly zone . The US embassy ... That 's our US embassy told we should accept the fact . Can you believe that ? You left a 12 year-old go para-sailing alone ? No ! He wasn 't alone . He was with a friend . Ben Hilderban . Paul and I divorced over a year ago . So why me ? He said we needed someone who had been on island before ? Yes . But I did not tell you to kidnap somebody . I have never been on this island . Sure you have . You wrote that book . That is Isla Nublar . This is Isla Sorna . You mean there are two islands with dinosaurs ? You stay out of this . So how long have he been missing ? - 8 weeks . - Almost 8 weeks . Billy , now go back to plane and set a camp . And we make for the coast . Dr Grant , we are not leaving this island without our son . You can go on and look for him . Or you can stick with us as long as you don 't hold us up . Either way , you probably won 't get out of this island alive . So ? What do we do ? Go and search for your son . That 's the direction they are going . That 's the one . Excellent . Oh , sorry . Sorry . It 's nothing you haven 't seen before . How much weight did you lose ? About 25 pounds ! I 've been swimming . I hate to swim . And I don 't even know how to swim . I learned . - You look good . - So are you . How would you classify , Billy ? It 's a super predator . Suchominus . I think bigger . Baryonyx ? Not on that cell . Spinosaurus stick up with this . I don 't remember that on lngen 's list . Because it wasn 't on there , unless it makes them wonder what they are up to . So , Mr Kirby , tell me . When you climbed K2 , did you based camp at 25,000 or 30,000 feet ? 30,000 feet . We were pretty close to the top . It is above 30,000 feet , actually . No . No . That 's a common mistake . Mr Kirby , there is no such thing as Kirby Enterprise , isn 't ? There 's Kirby Painting Tile and Plus . The Plus stands for bathroom fixtures . We 're in the West Case Shopping Centre ... I suppose we don 't check you out or anything ... Now , listen to me . I 'll pay you the money ... - This is good . - No matter what . We are in worst place on the world , we are not being pay . Alright , now wait . Fellows , hold on . I 'll make this up to you . If you ever do a bathroom or a kitchen ... You are not really a mercenary , are you ? I never said I was . That 's true . What are you ? I 'm like a booking agent . Guys who got sick count on me . Here . See we are now in a hardware store . Pay in title , yeah . You never can tell about people , do you ? You get the truth . Eric ! Quiet . Would you stop that ? Dr Grant said this is a very dangerous territory . Look . Maybe we should split up or something , you know ? We could cover twice as much of the island . Dr Grant says that is a bad idea . Dr Grant ... Dr Grant says this ... What 's the good of hiring an expert if we are not going to use his advice . Yeah . Except Dr Grant isn 't looking for Eric . He is looking for the coast . Okay , fine . Go ahead and scream . And when cry sake plot comes and attacks . Don 't come crying to me . - Not that bad . - What ? - Nothing . - What did you say ? - Nevermind . - What did you say ? If we split up , I 'm going along with you guys . - Eric ! - Eric ! - Mrs Kirby . - Eric ! Mrs Kirby ! Mrs Kirby , the chance is our remote . There are still in our resonance . An adult . Hey , guys . That 's my camera . The battery is dead . I got an idea . Let me have the camera . I shot this in the morning he disappeared . He is alive . I know he 's alive . We got to find him . Will we find one of those ? Maybe . Only if cell is not doing . Let 's take it . If we spot a plane , it might be the good way to get attention . I got it . Okay . Okay ! Mrs Kirby , please ! Okay , you are free . Come back , Mrs Kirby . Amanda , wait . Amanda . Amanda ? Amanda ... Amanda ! Amanda , stop ... I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry about Ben . It 's not Ben , Paul . It 's Eric . He 's out there all by himself . I know , I know . Our kid is out there all by himself . Listen to me . We 'll find him. I promise . Paul .. Dr Grant ! You should come and look at this ! Raptor . We are going to find him . Are you listening to me ? We are going to find him . This kid got resources . Remember last time we tried to ground him ? Where 's Billy ? What are you doing ? I was trying to go to the nest . Don 't do that again . I 'm sorry . If I lose you , that means you are a damn tourist . I bet they are in there , don 't you think ? I bet my bottom dollar . What you think it is ? That 's ancient . Four seasons . Eric ! Paul , don 't do that ... What the hell ? Who 's got some change ? Let me take some quarters . I got a buck ten ... This is how you make dinosaurs . No . This is how you play God . - That way ! - Look out . It 's locked . - This way ! - Go ! Go ! Hey ! Over here ! Push ! Push ! My God . It 's calling the other half . Come on ! It 's in a hurry . Out from the trace . Udesky . Mr Kirby ! Billy ! is Alan with you ? Oh my God ... Mr Udesky ! Mr Udesky ! He 's dead . Oh my God . No , he 's not . - No , he 's not ! - No ... Wait ! Something is not right . Amanda ! Hold on ! Hold on ! They set a trap . Yeah , they set a trap . What do you say ? What do you looking for ? Thanks . Thanks a lot , Eric . You know who I am ? Yeah , your parents are here . They are looking for you . - Together ? - Together . That 's not good . They don 't take so well to get together . I think it 's big surprise when people could do in it . When I have to . You are Alan Grant . What are you doing here ? Your parents ... invited me along . I read all of your books . I like the portion more . Before you are on the island . You like dinosaurs back then . Well back then they hadn 't try to eat me then . When I jumped in here , they left a lot of stuff behind . Any weapons ? No.l just use the gas ... And I appreciate that . Be careful with that T-rexas . Scare some of the small ones away , but attacks the really big one with defend . This is T-rexas ? How do you get it ? You don 't want to know . Dessert ? Sure . Eric , I have to tell you lost for eight weeks in this island . is that all has been ? You are alive . That 's the important thing . And thanks to you is one thing we have in common . Did you read Malcom 's book ? Yeah . So ? I don 't know. I mean ... lt was kind of preaching ... And too much chaos . Everthing is chaos . It seem like the guy was hiding himself . Well that 's two things we have in common . What is it ? Coelophysis . Alan ! Alan ! Alan ! No matter how this turns out it wasn 't your fault . Eric is always a sorry little kid . Always . And he threw someone like Ben Hilderban into the mess ... - Well ... - Well what ? All I 'm saying it 's not your fault . No ... If he 'd been with you , he 'll be completely safe . You drive 5 miles in every speed limit , Paul . And I 'd thrown three cars in three years . Well , not three . The Buek wasn 't really total . I just said I was , cause I wanted get a " Yes , you do " . I 'm so sorry that you have to be here . I 'm not . There 's a boat lie along side the bank . Looks in good shape . Rescue boat ? No . Someone left behind . Let 's move . Stick to the plan . Head for the coast . You are not going to look for Dr Grant . Heading the coast is Alan 's idea . If he 's alive , there is where he 's heading . I agree . What about Eric ? Eric is a smart kid . He probably know he stands a best chance by the coast . He figures all the big dinosaurus are in the centre of the island . Right ? Sure . You know what this is ? That 's a raptor claw . I have one . A fossil . Mine is new . How much do you explore ? I stick pretty close to the compound . I think if anyone is looking for me ... There 's where they started . We need to get to the coast . That was a plan . Are you sure ? The closer you get to the water , the bigger the things get . We have to find a way to the canyon to find a river out to the coast . After we find your parents . And then what ? One step to the time . Listen . What ? That 's my dad satellite phone . How do you know ? Kirby Painting Tile and Plus . Dad ! - Eric ! - Eric ! Eric ! This way ! Eric ! Mom ! Dad ! Eric ! Mom ! Dad ! I know it . Oh my God . I know it . Oh my God . Oh , I 'm glad to see you . Hey , you got my beg . Yeah , lucky strap . Want me to carry it ? Need to find a gap here . How did you know we were here ? The phone . The stupid jingle from the store . I heard it . My phone ? Yeah , your satellite phone . Where is it ? I don 't have it . When did you use it last night ? On the plane . I got a call on the place and ... What ? I loaned it to Nash . He must have had it when he ... Run . Alan , you wanna give me the bag back . It 's okay , Billy. I got it . Please give me the bag . It 's not safe . Raptor 's eggs ? Did you steal raptor 's eggs ? Now it all make sense . I swear if I know you 're gonna end up with them . I took them on an impose . I thought that the door with the fortune are enough for the things I obtain 10 more years . But you have to believe me this was a stupid decision . But I did it with the best intentions . With the best intentions ... Some other worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions . Come on , Billy . As far as I concern , you are not better than the people who built this place . What are you doing ? Those things are after us because of those . Those things know we have the eggs . I drop them into the river . They will still be after us . What if they catch us with them ? What if they catch us without them ? There is a boat at the bottom , just down the river . We try to make to the coast , at least . - You 're okay ? - Yeah . Let 's do this one other time , shall we ? Okay , come on over . One other time . Okay , Eric.l 'm gonna leave you just for a minute . And then you are going to be right behind me , okay ? Mom , I 've been alone in the water truck for eight weeks . I think I can manage the next few minutes without you . Right . We are all together now . Okay , Eric . - Come on , honey - You go . Mom ? Oh my God . What is it ? It 's a bird cage . For what ? Eric ! Eric ! I can 't stay without my kid . Eric ! This way ! Billy ! Billy , stop . Billy , stop ! Stop , Billy ! Billy ! Eric , hold on ! Eric ! Jump ! Billy ! Look out now ! Eric ! Eric ! There he is ! With the pteranodous . Get him out of there . Go ! Go ! What about Billy ? Hang on , Billy ! Go away ! Go away ! Come on ! It 's playing the gasoline . Now just got to get out to the coast . We got some sort of ... some sort of signal . Build the fire or something . Something that can see from the air . Dr Grant ? Hey , Eric . How are you doing ? I 'm sorry about Billy . You know what 's the last thing I said to him was ? It 's ... he 's as bad as the people who built this place . It wasn 't true . Billy is just young ... that 's all . I have a theory there is two kind of boys . Those who want to be astronomers . And those who want to be astronauts . The astronomers , the paying intelligence . Get to study this amazing things from a place with complete safety . But he never got to go into space . Exactly . Its the difference between imagining and seeing . Be able to touch them . And ... that 's all Billy wanted . Dr Grant ... lt is open , Dr Grant . Billy was right . Listen . Find the phone before it stops ringing . Eric , stand there . - lt 's here - Wait , it 's here . I got it . Hello ? Hello ? " Enjoy your meal in one of our four star restaurant ... " Look out ! Turn off the power . You got to choose for making one call . What do you do ? Don 't call the US embassy . They won 't do a damn thing . Hey , guys . Come here . Look at this ! What is this ? Something must have spook them . Get the edge of calling , Mr Kirby . Open the plot . Hello ? Ellie ! Hello ? Charlie ! Charlie , take the phone to mommy now . It 's the dinosaur man . Okay . Charlie , are you taking the phone to mom ? Charlie ? Who 's in the phone ? The dinosaur man . He is ? Alan ? - Where 's the phone ? - There . Get the phone . Ellie , listen to me ! Alan , are you on a cell phone ? I can 't hear you . The raptor chases me ... Hello ? Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! Paul , you can 't ... You can 't leave me like this . I 'm not going anywhere . Dad ! Remember when we went fishing a couple summers ago ? We putted the boat in the water and the trailer sank . The toll truck tried to pull us out and they got drag in too . The truck driver wanted to knock my lights out . I miss fishing . Mr Kirby . That lady you called . Who is she ? How do you know that she can help us ? She is the person I can always count on . I owe her a lot . I don 't think I have ever told her that . You should . You hear that ? The ocean . Pick up your eggs . Otherwise we 'll be dead already . Everybody get down . She is challenging us . She thinks she stole the eggs . Get behind me . Give me the eggs . Do it , mom . No ... No ... Call for help . That 's a helicopter . Dr Grant ? Dr Alan Grant ? No ! That 's a very bad idea ! You have to thank her now . She 's in the NAVY . God bless you , Ellie . - ls this man with you ? - What ? We made it ... Yeah . I rescue your hat . Give me that . That 's the important thing . Dr Grant ! What the hell is that ? Dr Grant , look ! Where do you think they are going ? I don 't know . Maybe just looking for a new nesting ground . It 's all in the world for them . How dare them to nest in Olakhoma ? Let 's go home . - THE END -

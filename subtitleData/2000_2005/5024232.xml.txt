 carl 's Jr. has this $ 6 burger , which really only costs $ 3.95 ... ... so you think you 're getting some deal ... ... but the truth is , it may be the best franchise burger out there . I went there yesterday and ordered three . By golly , those suckers almost filled me up . When I got home , I still had to have a box of Eggos ... ... but that doesn 't take away from carl 's achievement . I mean , here 's a guy who 's got to go through life as carl Junior , right ? Like he can never get out of the shadow of his dad , the original carl , I guess . Do you think this eating has to do with thinking you killed your mother ? That you 're eating yourself to death as punishment ? - You do think you killed her , right ? - I never said that . She called out to you from that big , fancy oak bed . - She said she was having chest pain . - I never told you any of that ! - How could you know this ? - She begged you to dial 91 1 . But she was always calling out for you , wasn 't she , Barry ? You weren 't there . How could you know what happened ? How ? Doesn 't matter . What matters is , you 've got to stop blaming yourself . If you don 't , you 'II eat yourself into an early grave for no reason . You 're looking in my head ! Stop it ! - Don 't look in there . - You don 't have to do it , Barry . Leave me alone ! It wasn 't your fault . Jonesy ? Hey , how are you doing , Henry ? What 's that you say ? Are you going deaf ? How are you doing ? You know . SSDD . Well , yeah , of course . Hey , I was thinking if you were free this weekend we might go see Duddits . Yeah , absolutely . He 's been on my mind a Iot too . It 's been a Iong time . It 's open ! I gotta go . I got a thing here . I 'II see you Saturday . Yeah , right . See you Saturday . So , Mr. Defuniak ... ... do you know we 're both escapees from Maine ? You 're from PittsfieId . Know what happens to scholarship students caught cheating on exams ? You had the flu that day , didn 't you , David ? You didn 't take the exam ? You missed the test . And since you were ill , why not write me an essay instead ? 3000 words on the short-term results of the Norman Conquest . - Go get started . - Yes , sir . Better to be from PittsfieId than go back to it . Thank you , sir . How did you know ? You weren 't even there that day . Sometimes I just know . hello . This probably won 't work . Never start like that with a car salesman . We love challenges . Pete Moore . In one hour I 'm showing a house in Fryeburg . It 's a big commission . And I just lost my damn car keys . could you possibly make me duplicates ? - That takes at Ieast a day . - Oh , boy , I just knew it ! Easy , Trish . Maybe I can help . I 'm always good at finding things . - Did I say my name ? I don 't remember- - - I guessed . Now , Iet 's find those keys . - Hey , rachel . - Hey , Pete . - I Iooked again . I couldn 't find them . - Okay . I need your help . You had the coffee in your hand , bought aspirin ... ... went to your car , realized the keys were gone . - That everything ? - Yes . Look . This is gonna seem weird , but it 's just a thing I do to help me think . You bought a candy bar before the aspirin . Mars bar . Yours , right ? One more question . If I find your keys , will you let me buy you dinner ? West Wharf ? 6 : 30 ? Best fried clams in the state ? It 's right on your way back . Sure . Okay . - That 'd be nice . - AII right . So you got here . You opened your purse . Coffee , candy and aspirin , you 're juggling it all around . And that 's when ... ... you dropped your keys . It 's just luck , is all . Thank you . - West Wharf , right ? half past six ? - You got it . Another fuckarow . - Jones . - How are you doing ? - Hey , Beaver . Same shit , different day . - Same shit , different day . - Wanna talk ? - No , you 're trying to get home . - What 's up ? - really , I got nothing . Go home . - Wait , Jonesy ? - Yeah , Beav ? - You be careful . - Be careful of what ? Wish I knew . What did you say ? I didn 't say anything . Right . Sorry . - Somebody call an ambulance ! - It won 't do any good . I Iooked away for one second . Then I heard a thump . What happened ? Oh , my God ! Professor Jones ! I just saw him . He can 't die ! clear ! No good . FIatIine . Hit it again ! clear ! - What do you think ? - I think it 's no good . I think he 's gone . Watch out for Ister Gay . Jonesy , don 't try to lift that stuff . - Just go up to the cabin . I 'II get that . - Here , here , look . Big jacket . - Beaver , I 'm going in ! - AII right , I 'II see you in a second ! Watch the beer . - Got blown last night . - Good for you . - First time ? - Bite my bag . Met some lady at bingo , went back to her place , turned into a nice fuckaree . - As opposed to a fuckarow . - obviously . Though I 've had perfectly good fuckarees turn into fuckarows in a flash . - Try Viagra . - Viagra ? I 'm practically at full salute all day . I 'm ... . What do you call it ? Privatic ? Prag- - Prasmatic ? Henry will know . - You 're thinking of fourth grade . - You 're having wood problems ? - You haven 't tried it , have you ? - hell , no ! Drop that little blue bomb , you 're hard as a louisville slugger for 1 2 hours . twelve hours ? I 'm talking Yastrzemski . You don 't have to need it to love it . Bingo ? Did you say bingo , Iike the game in church basements ? - There 's trim there . - Beaver ! I thought my deal was pathetic . - You just watch . That 's your job . - I 'm fine . H , you been thinking about Duddits more than usual ? Remember we were gonna go see him that weekend ? - I remember . - Then I got hit . I gotta tell you something weird . The night I got hit , I was standing there and across the street , I saw Duddits . Just like he was that day we first saw him back in Derry . He was calling out for help and everyone was ignoring him . Then he looked over at me . He looked directly at me . And he motioned for me to come to him . You believe I saw him , don 't you ? Yes , sir , I do . Duddits loves me , I know that . He loves us all . He would die before he 'd ever hurt us . So why was he calling me into the street to get hit ? Maybe there 's more to the story we don 't get yet . - You don 't know shit . - Name it ! I 'II name it after we come up with a small wager . - 50 bucks . - What 's the subject ? In the movies , when people wake up together ... ... they immediately start kissing and going at it . But they never get up first , take a leak and brush their goddamn teeth . Which is pretty much necessary when you wake up . What 's it called when you got a constant woody ? - You mean priapism . - See ? I 'm practically priasmic . Priapismic . - Whatever ! It 's hard . - That 's what you 're betting on ? I can name the one movie where they acknowledge the scuzzy facts of Iife . - I 'II give you a quarter . - A quarter from you . 50 bucks from you . - Promised Land . - Promised Land ? Never heard of it . Meg Ryan and what 's his name ? Reefer SutherIand . - Kiefer . - From , I don 't know , 1 988 or something ? So Meg Ryan wakes up in the morning and says , " Where 's the cat ? " And he says , " What cat ? " And she says , " The cat that shit in my mouth . " That will be 50 small . - bullshit ! You made it up . - could Beaver make that up ? You can have that priceless piece of cinematic trivia absolutely free . I 'm filing that in the " Who-gives-a-shit " section of my memory warehouse . - What 's the memory warehouse ? - You don 't remember ? - I must 've forgot . - You forgot ? - Just remind me . Don 't give me shit . - It 's in his head . We 've all got one . - Hasn 't that place been condemned ? - Not yet . It 's so crowded I throw something out every time I learn something new . When I got my new laptop I had to throw out my files of rock ' n ' roll lyrics . My warehouse was washed away in a flood about 1 0 years ago . I didn 't know they had enough beer in Maine for a flood . Jonesy , if that really is your name ... - ... what do you do with the old files ? - I burn them . - You threw out the " blue Bayou " lyrics ? - No . No , if I really can 't let go of something ... ... I sneak it back to an office where I keep my secret stuff . Where do you keep the stuff on Duddits ? He 's got a special section all his own on the third level . I can 't stop thinking about the Duds lately . How about you guys ? It 's this place . He 's all around here , even though he 's never been here . This is our 20th year coming out here to hole in the wall . And fuck me , Freddy , here 's to 20 more . Twenty more . Here 's to Duddits ... ... our dreamcatcher . Wish he was here . To the Duds . - To douglas CaveII . - To Duddits . Why is Tina SchIossinger 's pussy on the wall of Tracker Brothers ? Because I said so . It 's a picture . - Have you seen it ? - No ... ... but the kid who sits behind me in shop , he saw it . Tracker Brothers is deserted . You don 't want to see the homecoming queen 's pussy ? Don 't come . Fuck me , Freddy ! Some kid 's shirt . - So ? - It 's new ! Scooby-Doo . " I belong to douglas CaveII . " " If the boy I belong to is lost , please bring him to 1 9 maple Lane , Derry . " Must belong to one of those kids from the Retard Academy . Come on . Eat it . Eat it . Eat it and you can go . Hey , you guys ! Quit it ! Just fucking quit it ! What are you doing ? You 're trying to make him eat that ? What 's wrong with you ? Got it . I 'II make him eat this dog turd , then he can go . You go now . unless you want half . Take a hike , girls , while you have the chance . Piss off . That 's your final warning . - You better watch it ! - Why is that ? - I know who you are . - I 'm trembling with fear . - You 're Rich Grenadeau , the quarterback ! - So ? What will people say when we tell them what we caught you doing ? You won 't tell anybody anything because you 'II be dead . - Get ready , Pete . - Give the word , Henry . Pete can fly . When you come for us , all we have to do is get in your way . I can 't catch that little dick ? You know who that is ? That 's Pete Moore . That 's right , fat-ass . Pete Moore . No one can catch him . He 's going straight to his house to tell his mother . She 'II call the cops and then we 'II see . - You know him , is that it ? - Never saw him . Then why ask for trouble ? I mean , look at this moron ! - He likes this attention . - How do you know what he likes ? Come on , you dickweeds ! - You want to fight us ? - Yes ! Yes ! I 'm gone , Henry . Just say the word . - Why ? You 'II lose ! Why ? - Because you can 't do that ! It 's wrong ! And I 'm gonna tell the world ! tell everybody ! - You want us to leave , is that it ? - No ! Let 's kick their asses ! Let 's go . We 'II get him later . You know that . Get you all later . It 's okay . You can stop now . Do something . Somebody ! If I do ... ... and you tell anybody , I 'II never hang with you guys again . I never knew Beav could sing . - Beaver , that 's beautiful . - I mean it . Not one word . Eaver ! You 've got a fan . This yours ? douglas CaveII . That 's your name , right ? I Duddits . - What ? - I Duddits ! - Duddits ? - Duddits . Duddits , we got to get you home . Hey , guys ! Come here ! Leave the kid there . Stand right here , Duddits . Right here with Scooby , okay ? Jesus Christ bananas ! No way is that Tina Jean SchIossinger . Maybe her grandmother . Good going , Beav . holy God . We came all the way here just for that ? No . We came for him . Hey , Pete . You forgot the dogs . Weather moving in . double storm . alberta clipper first , maybe 8 inches ... ... with a nor 'easter on its tail . - Get on back to the cabin , Henry . - Heading straight there , Mr. G. - Don 't mess around . - No , sir . Easy , fella . Easy . You 're okay . You 're all right . Thank God . Thank God . Gee , thank God ! I 'm lost . I 've been lost in the woods since yesterday . Let 's get you inside . Get you warm . - How would that be ? - Sure . Here , Iet me get that . - Rick McCarthy . - Gary Jones . It 's Jonesy to everybody . Our damn cell phones are on the blink now , so I can 't call for help ... ... but our car will be back soon . I didn 't think I 'd make it . I lost the folks I was with . You saved me , that 's for sure . What 's that ? It 's a dreamcatcher . Indian charm . Catches nightmares ... ... keeps them away . Keeps you safe down here . I 've had enough nightmares . Been doing that all night . I ate some berries in the dark . I think they must have upset me . I know what you 're thinking . Anyone who drinks at 1 1 a.m. needs to take the cure , but I only do it here . In the real world , I never drink till after 5 : 00 ... ... and if it ever does , I 'm on the wagon for life . glad to hear it . What 's the matter with you ? About six months ago , the day Jonesy got hit ... ... I did something terrible with a patient . I humiliated him . Drove him out . Barry Neiman . couple days ago , I saw his picture in the paper . He ate himself to death . Mind if I don 't use that story next time I 'm trying to sell a Mustang ? You were a lead balloon long before this porker munched his way to eternity . Thanks . You 're a real comfort . You got a real delicate touch to you . Here you go , Rick , buddy . That will fix you up . Jesus Christ bananas ! Some fuckarow this is turning into ! - Thanks a Iot , Beav . - Yeah , I think I got it all . What happened to you ? Hi . Joe CIarendon . call me Beaver . Rick here had a bad night in the woods . welcome . - Is that frostbite ? - No , I get the same thing from peanuts . It 's allergy . grilled cheese , anyone ? - No , the soup 's fine for me , thanks . - I 'II bite . sail it over here . My mother used to feed me pea soup when I was feeIing- - Bitch in a buzz saw ! I 've heard some mighty burps in my time , but that 's the blue ribbon . I am so embarrassed . Rick ate some berries in the woods . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God , that 's awful ! I 'm so sorry ! Rick , buddy , don 't worry about it . There 's more room out than in , anyway . What have you been eating , woodchuck turds ? Know what I think ? I think you need to lie down and take you a little nap . You know , I bet you 're right . I 'm just tired , that 's all . - Come on . - My hat . Beaver ? In here . Thank you for taking me in . Thank you both . - Shit , anybody would have . - Maybe . Maybe not . AII right , this is in case you have to urk ... ... if you can 't get to the bathroom , which is the third door to your left . If you go in the first , you 'II take a shit in the closet . If you need anything , we 're outside . Fuck me , give me some air ! We got any gas masks handy ? We need a biohazard team in here . - Wanna hear what 'II freak you out more ? - Not really . You know his huge stomach ? When he got here , his stomach was normal , but his chest was out to here ! I wish Henry was here . He 's a shrink , not an internist . He went to med school . Did you ? I thought about it . You better get a run at it . - Shit ! - Watch it ! What the hell ? - Pete , are you okay ? - No , I broke my leg ! Man , my damn leg ! Okay . Hang on . Hang on a second . - I 'm caught ! I can 't- - - God ! - God . - Henry ! A little help here ! Hang on , Pete . Hang on . - Okay . Here comes the seat belt . - I just opened that beer . I got you . How 's your leg ? well , it ain 't broken . It 's just locked up , is all . You don 't suppose he got exposed to radiation ? I saw that once in a movie . Guy ended up bald as telly what 's-his-fuck . This guy 's got plenty of hair . But that red mark got bigger while I watched it . - What are you doing ? - Peanut butter calms me down . - Somebody else might want to use that . - I 'II leave some . Beav . Beaver . CriminettIies ! I think it 's a woman . I ought to warn you . I 'm gonna strangle this broad . - I 'd guess she 's already dead . - I 'II strangle her anyway . She almost got us both killed . hello ! Here we come , ma 'am . Don 't be startled . hello ? Forget it , H. She 's gone . hello ! Ma 'am , can you hear me ? Are you okay ? Can you hear me ? I wonder if maybe that 's how they say hello around here . Listen , Miss Road kill , you almost got us dead . Say something . I have to find Rick . - Okay . - Rick . Yeah . Fuck me , Freddy . - What 's all that red stuff on their fur ? - Just like McCarthy 's cheek . - I never saw anything like this before . - Even the bears look scared . - Of what ? Where are they going ? - It 's not where that worries me ... ... it 's what are they running away from ? What the hell ? This could be perfect . They can get Stinky to a hospital . Hey , you guys ! - We need help ! Got a sick guy inside ! - This area is under temporary quarantine . - Stay where you are . - What quarantine ? - We got a sick guy down here ! - We need your help here ! - We got a real sick guy here ! - Take him with you now ! Glad you 're okay . This situation will be resolved in 24 to 48 hours . Kiss my bender ! I gotta ask you , old buddy . Because I 'm confused . - Is this SSDD or not ? - definitely not . Different shit today , Pete . And a pretty weird day so far , if you want to know . Over here . There you go . Easy . It 's nine miles to hole in the wall . I think I can manage it . I 'II bring the snowmobile back and get you both . Now , Pete , you listen to me . Don 't go back to the car for beer . - Stay with her . Keep her warm . - Right hand to God , Dr. D. Henry ! If we die before you get back ... ... promise you 'II tell everybody she wasn 't my date . I 'm telling you , Jonesy , I don 't like this at all . This is turning into a double fuckarow . A real jobba-nobba . - Rick , you okay ? - I 'm a little sick , fellas . - I just need to make a little room . - McCarthy , Rick , open up , man . - Go away ! - Open the door or we break it down . - Can 't a man have some privacy ? - Rick , where are you bleeding from ? bleeding ? I 'm not bleeding . - Let 's do it . - I 'm not positive I wanna go in there . What if he 's dying ? Scooby-Dooby-Doo , we got some work to do now . On three . Ready ? One ... . Two ... . hold it ! What if we just bounce off ? - No bounce , no play . - Right . No bounce , no play . One ... . And a two ... . Three ! Oh , fuck ! Oh , man ! Fuck ! I don 't want to see this ! I can 't see this . - Shut up a minute . Mr. McCarthy ? Rick ? - Is he still alive ? I don 't know . Rick ? Rick , are you- - ? Oh , man ! Jonesy , if he can still do that , he must be alive . Can you hear me ? I think he 's dead . bullshit ! He dropped a clinker ! I heard it . - I don 't think that was a clinker . - That 's enough , snap out of it ! - Oh , my God ! - My God ! - No ! - No ? Good move ! It 's trapped . Got nowhere to go but the septic tank . Oh , shit ! - Listen , we 're gonna change places . - What ? - One of us is gonna go to the shed . - No way ! Shut up and listen ! There 's friction tape there . You go get it , come back . We 'II tape the lid down . Then we 're gonna get the hell out of here ! - You get the tape , Jonesy . - Don 't be brave , Beav . You 're faster than me . I 'II sit on Thumper . No , if it does get out , you can 't fight it . Not with your hip . Oh , my God ! Goddamn it ! Go ! - And Beav ? - Yeah ? Sit tight , buddy . Okay . AII right . Okay . Shit ! Earth to Jonesy ! Come in , Jonesy ! Jonesy . Jonesy . calm down now . Okay . Okay . Okay , here it is . Okay . Find the damn tape ! Where is it ? Coming , Beav ! Beaver ! Beav ! I got the- - What the- - ? Jonesy , get out of here ! Beaver . - Get out ! Shut the door ! - No . Run , Jonesy . You killed him . You killed Beaver . You killed him , you fuck ! What do you want ? The men call the red stuff RipIey , after the broad in the Alien movies . We eradicate the animals as they flee the blue Zone . And the populace ? We 're bringing civilians to GosseIin 's . We 'II detain them till we figure this out . And , Owen ? This time the ETs belong to you . That 's right , bucko . - You 'II be blue Boy leader . - finally . - How many left ? - About a hundred . Yeah . Not nearly enough for a serious incursion . My guess is , it 's a crash-Ianding . They 've never picked terrain like this before or cold weather . What 's your call ? The biggest threat is them getting out of our net . Crash-Ianding or not ... ... they 'II try to get out and spread the infection . I always say they never visited a world they wouldn 't rather own . They 're up to their old tricks . Using a standard grayboy look ... ... with the innocent doggy eyes and smooth baby-butt skin . They project what they think we want to see . But I 've had a look at the real thing . You wouldn 't want it marrying your sister . - Difference of opinion about the RipIey . - really ? Who has an opinion ? - Who do you think ? - general Matheson . - Three-star general Matheson . - Three ? - When did you see him ? - They called me in yesterday . What 's the opinion of those enlightened cocksuckers ... ... who 've never been near an ET ? They say the fungus doesn 't take hold in all victims . Some of them get over it . really ? And what about the shit weaseIs ? The ones blasting out the basement door ? Does Matheson think folks get over one of those puppies ? Their theory is , they only grow in a small percentage of the exposed population . Do you Iike that theory , bucko ? I think it 's crap . So if you thought someone had been exposed ... - ... and you had them in your grasp- - - I wouldn 't want them walking out ... - ... to wander as they wish . - Bucko , I think we 're on the same page . Pissing in the same Iatrine . If the RipIey gets out of this pine-tree paradise ... . well , it just can 't be allowed to do that . I 've quarantined the entire area . - Nothing leaves alive . - Roger that , boss . Come ! Got MapIes here , boss . - corporal MapIes , sir . I mean , boss . - I know who you are , maples . I handpicked every man in blue Boy . Sometimes I wonder about my judgment . - Yes , sir . I 'm sorry , boss . - Do you know the blue Unit catechism ? - Yes , the B.U.C. for all buckos . - Is blue Unit part of regular Army ? - No , boss . Better . - How does blue Unit operate ? Under the radar . We don 't salute , display rank , say " sir . " A force unto ourselves . - regular Army compared to blue Unit ? - Pussies . - What rules does blue Unit operate by ? - rules of combat . That 's right , Iaddie . When a soldier disobeys a superior 's orders , he puts everyone at risk . And is to be punished immediately by appropriate command personnel . That 's me . Capisce ? Good . Now answer me one question and you can boogie out of here . But you have to answer honestly . You were on containment detail at 0600 this morning , sector 1 4 of blue Zone . Did you allow a young woman and her 4-year-oId daughter ... ... to exit the zone in their own vehicle on Hickam valley Road ? colonel Curtis , she hadn 't been in the zone . She made a wrong turn . She couldn 't have been contaminated . You know this for a fact ? Or because she told you so ? - For a fact , boss . - Scout 's honor ? Can you raise your hand and tell me honestly that you know this for a fact ? Then do it , maples . Swear on it . Scout 's honor . Scout 's honor . Stop your bIatting , Iaddie-buck ! You just avoided a court-martiaI , boy . You lie to me again , you 'II be facing a firing squad . - Get him out before I change my mind . - Let 's get him out of here . Sentry ! - Jesus , Abe . - I warned him . could have gotten off with a slap on the wrist . - Instead of taking his whole hand ? - He crossed the Curtis line ! He came into my house , told me lies . - You think I 'm crazy , Owen ? - A little . I lost my temper there . But that little worm did something worse . The pretty mom he let pass this morning ? She 's down at the barn right now crawling with the RipIey . Twenty-five years , Owen . Twenty-five years I 've been going out to fight these alien bastards ... ... show them they picked the wrong place , knocked on the wrong door . And frankly , Iaddie , the tank is running a little low . luckily for me , there 's one bit of good news in this blizzard of bullshit . I have you . To lead the assault today and to take over for me tomorrow . - What are you talking about , Abe ? - It 's my last dance , Owen . From now on , you will lead the band . - You know where I got that ? - John Wayne . That 's right . He gave it to me . And now I 'm giving it to you . - Abe , I don 't know how to ... . - Let 's not get all girlie with each other . - Just tell me how we do it . - We go in fast and hard . - How do we come out ? - clean ... ... and smiling . Honey , I 'm home . That 's a good idea . Catch a little shuteye . Save your energy for those horrendous farts ! well , it 's very nice of you to say so . I find you very attractive also . You 're one of those rare women who can handle the fuII-size Ford Expedition . The truck that handles like a luxury car . A really big luxury car . But seriously , folks , there is one issue I 'd Iike to bring up ... ... just in case I should , you know , kick the bucket out here ... ... turn into a goddamn PetesicIe . Not that I think that 's inevitable . I 'm sure Henry or Jonesy or Beaver will be coming to get us soon . They 're my friends . We 're all best friends . Now , ma 'am , I 'II be very candid with you about this ... ... so please , don 't get freaked out or think that I 'm some kind of weirdo ... ... who you shouldn 't meet for the best fried clams in Maine . Just some innocent fried clams at the West Wharf ! You see , the four of us , best friends ... ... we all have this other friend by the name of Duddits . And our friend Duddits , well , he 's not your average old buddy . One day , a Iong time ago , he gave us all this kind of gift . It 's this ... . How shall I put it ? This ability . This ability to know things ... ... to talk to each other without talking at all , just mind-to-mind . Do you see what I 'm getting at ? I knew you would . lately , I 've been having this dream ... ... and in the dream , I understand how Duddits could give us a gift like that . I think maybe our friend Duds is not from this planet . I think Duddits is from somewhere else ... ... and he came here to prepare us for something . It 's crazy . talking shit about the only perfect person I ever knew . He 's so goddamned good . I can 't believe he 's a human . I should be singing his praises , not questioning what galaxy he 's- - I gotta pee . That 's what I should be doing . Here 's to you , Duds . The highest civilian decoration . Lord , I will never drink again . Let me get this straight . Yesterday you want to call it quits , throw in the towel , pull the plug . Today , you 're begging , praying . couple more hours . couple more miles . Make up your mind . Jonesy ! Way to go , motherfucker ! Here you come to save the day ! What the hell ? Who 's Mr. Gray ? What are you trying to tell me , Jonesy ? You 're not Jonesy . What was that , Mr. Jones ? What did we just pass on the road ? - Are you speaking to me ? - Yes , I am , Mr. Jones . Or is it Jonesy ? That 's what your friends call you , isn 't it ? Let 's be friends . - Why are you letting me live ? - I 'm borrowing you . - We 're going to take a little journey . - Beaver never hurt a soul . You killed him . He had nothing in his head . I 've found something useful in yours . - Fuck you ! - I know what that expression means . I 've studied the foul language section of your memory warehouse . Rather distasteful , I must say . How about this , Mr. Gray ? Eat shit and die . Why did you call me Mr. Gray ? Watch out for Ister Gay . Someone told you about me . Who told you about me ? If you want to know , why don 't you read my mind ? surprisingly , you 're able to keep things from me ... ... I don 't understand it . But I 'm sure I 'II figure it out soon . Oh , Pete , Jesus ! Motherfucker tried to bite my dick off , Jonesy . I always thought it wouId be my ex-wife did that . Let 's get you to some help . Can you still see the line , buddy ? - I don 't need it to get to GosseIin 's . - No , I know that , but ... ... if we didn 't want to go to GosseIin 's , how would you get us out to 95 ? 95 ? Who gives a shit ? I 'm hurting here , Jonesy . What 's wrong with you ? - Wait a minute , you 're not- - - Shut up , Pete . You 're too messed up to know what you 're saying . Too late for that . Pete , I need you to get onto the snowmobile right now . Who the fuck are you ? You sound like one of those James Bonds ! This has to do with the fucking eel , doesn 't it ? You 're not- - Stop it ! I 'II get him to help . Pete , tell him what he wants to know . Now , Pete , which way to I-95 ? I need to go to Massachusetts . My , my . That is a gift . Who taught you that ? You 're gonna be a big help , Pete . climb aboard . - Show 's over out there . Let me in . - Let me in . What have you got in that part of your mind , professor ? Your memories are out here in the warehouse , aren 't they ? I want to know who warned you about me . And who taught Pete that trick ? I 'm sure the answers are here . It 'II just take me a while to find them . - To find them . - Think about letting me in . - It 's the polite thing to do . - Polite thing to do . Beav ! What is this ? Beav . Shit ! Fuck me , Freddy . asshole ! So long , Beav . Love you , man . We all made them in art . I finished first , so I made one for you , Duds . Mine 's deformed . I couldn 't figure out the string . - Eaver , Henny , Ownzy , Eet ! - That 's right , my man . I Duddits . - Yes . I Duddits . - I Duddits ! I Duddits ! - Duds will find her . - How ? - He can do anything . - She 's from the Retard Academy . - She always waves . - We 've gotta save this girl . - Save this world ? - Not the world , Duds . A girl . - We 'II save the world some other time . - Ister Gay ? - Yeah , it 's a mystery . - We need you to solve it . - Dreamcatcher . Duds 'II read our minds . - Not this again . - Shut up . - We gotta think of Josie . Josie , Josie , Josie . " Josie Rinkenhauer . " - Josie ? - That 's right . Can you find Josie ? - This is completely crazy . - You can say that again . - I didn 't say anything . - You did . I heard you . - You said , " This is completely crazy . " - I didn 't say that . I thought it . Kiss my bender . Duds can hear people 's thoughts . We can 't . Are you sure of that , Beav ? Hey , guys ! She 's down here for sure ! Josie , you down there ? Josie ! Josie ! Fuck me , Freddy , she 's down there . I know it . I can see her in my head . - Yeah . - Me too . help ! please ! - help me . - hold on , Josie , we 're coming ! Josie , hang in there ! Don 't sing . She 's scared enough . - Shut up . There 's , Iike , rat shit in here . - hold on to my feet ! Pete , do you see anything ? - Duds ! We got her ! - Here 's Josie . blue Boy leader . How we doing , bucko ? - Right here , boss . Fast and hard . - WouIdn 't have it any other way . Sir ? I see it . - Don ' t hurt us . - We 're dying . - There is no infection here . - Whose radio is that ? It 's not the radio . They 're putting it into our heads . - We are helpless . - There it is , gentlemen . - There 's no infection here . - directly into our heads . This gives you an idea what we 're up against . If anybody 's thinking , " Those poor , helpless little folk ... ... all naked and unarmed beside their crashed intergaIactic Winnebago ... ... what kind of a dog , what kind of a monster ... ... could hear that heartbreak and go in just the same ? " - well , I 'm that dog . I 'm that monster . - We are helpless . We are dying . These mothers are as harmless as a fox in a henhouse . And I 'm here to kick some ass ! Are you with me ? - Yes , boss ! - Roger that , boss . Right on , boss . Don ' t hurt us . I have a visual . Holy shit ! Damn , look at the size of that . Blue Boy group , this is Blue Boy leader . Target imminent . Go to level 4 readiness . gentlemen , lock and load . HeIIfires are hot . Sing it out , Owen ! blue Boy group , this is blue Boy leader . clean up the forest , get rid of this trash ! - Don 't hurt us . - please , don 't hurt us . - There is no infection here . - We are helpless . - Fire at will ! - Fire ! Owen , get them out of there ! It 's gonna blow ! blue Boy group , withdraw at once . I repeat , cease firing and back off ! - We can get them ! - It 's self-destructing . Back off ! - blue Boy group , get out of there ! - We 're on top of it ! Owen , pull out now ! - Pull out ! Get out of there ! - pull out ! Jonesy , I 've been thinking about our friend . Our Scooby-Doo buddy . For a Iong time I thought he was sent to us to warn us about something . - I couId never figure what it was . - Don 't talk about him . Not till today . It was this , right now . - He wanted to warn us . - Go ahead . tell me about your friend . - Did he show you that nifty trick ? - No . Jonesy 's right . - Come on , Pete . Let 's talk . - Bite my bag , motherfucker ! AII right , Pete , I 'II bite . Your bag and everything else . No , no ! You bastard ! No ! Pete . Don 't talk to him ! Get out of there ! - What 's up ? - Thank God you came by , governor . I 'm broke down here and fearing for my Iife . That 's a good-Iooking dog . - Where you headed ? - GosseIin 's . Any chance you 're going near there ? That 's where I 'm going . well , I believe your tailgate has come open . Let 's take a look . I see you have some cargo you 're taking to blue Base . Got a treat for you , Ike . AII you can eat . Eat all the red stuff . Good doggy . Yes . Good boy . Have your fill . Tasty , tasty . Eat all you want- - Jonesy . What are you up to ? Jonesy ! Oh , God ! halt or we 'II fire ! You cannot leave the quarantine zone ! - halt ! - I think I just about halted here . Come with me , Owen . I 'II show you things you 'II wish you 'd never seen . - How long we gotta be here ? - It 'II be all right . - I demand to see my lawyer ! - There must be something they can do . Don 't worry , you 'II be fine . - When do we get out ? - Within hours . - You can 't do this to people in America ! - I told you to stay over there ! - My wife- - - Government 's doing what they can ... ... to get you out of here . please don 't worry . It 's all right . We 're doing everything to make sure you 're safe . We 'II get you back to your homes within hours . AII clear . Can I help you , sir ? What 's your name ? - Henry . Dr. Henry DevIin . - A doctor ? Good . We need doctors in there . Come on , Iaddie , I 'II buy you a cup . - You , sir , where you from ? - Boston . Beantown ? Great city . We 'II have you back there in no time . Maybe by morning . Hurry up , bucko . You see that crud on the faces of children ... ... you know why I relish a turn in the country like we had today . You were excellent out there , O. It made me feel very proud to- - Abe ? Abe , you okay ? Abe ? Yeah , I 'm fine . I 'm fine . I must be getting too old for this shit . I don 't know what the hell that was about . It 's the only way , Owen . We 've got to cauterize the site . They 've all got to die . It 's the only way . But we don 't know that . Studies point to the strong possibility of recovery for many exposed subjects . The studies show squat , that 's what they show . If Matheson had been in my spot for the Iast quarter-century ... ... you 'd have never made it to your first jerk-off . Those gray bastards would have had you for lunch back in Armpit , Kentucky . Some get better . At least half will be over it in a few days- - Which ones , Mother Teresa ? Can you guarantee they won 't take it home like a present for the family ? I 'II tell you what you should be worried about . What should be on your mind . Not these few unfortunates . What you should be worried about is a hitchhiker . - What ? - A hitchhiker . Our greatest fear is that a grayboy would catch a ride ... ... with somebody and would carry them out of here , without being consumed . To scatter the infection , Iike Johnny-fucking-AppIeseed . - Are you sure there isn 't such a person ? - No . But I am sure that if there is one he won 't get out . Not with the net my boys put up around the blue Zone . And if we do a thorough job on the ones we 've got . If we don 't get gooey about the little picture ... ... when our job is taking care of the big one . Capisce ? Owen , if you think this is easy for me , you 're crazier than my mother was . Those poor schmucks . They drive ChevroIets , shop at WaI-Mart ... ... never miss an episode of Friends . These are Americans . The idea of slaughtering Americans ... ... it just turns my stomach . But I 'II do it . I 'II do it because it needs to be done . So if we start at 2 , we can be done by 2 : 30 . And it 's all behind us . Except for the dreams . Yeah , except for them . What are you gonna tell Rita about what you did here ? What are you gonna tell Katrina when she 's old enough to ask ? You know me , don 't you ? I don 't remember when we met ... ... but you know me . We don 't have time to screw around . You 've got two problems . - One you know about , one you don 't . - Go ahead . Your mentor , colonel Curtis , he 's gone insane from hunting aliens for 25 years . Now he wants you to help him kill hundreds of innocent people . - Who are you ? - Me ? talk about that later , once we get out of here . You 're predictable . You won 't let me burn on this fence ... ... any more than you 'II help Curtis kill those people . What you 're thinking now is whether that digital sat-scan transmitter ... ... in your duffle bag will let you get through to somebody . Somebody named general Matheson . " Sometimes we have to kill , but our real job is to save lives . " Your father was a great soldier . Those were his last words . You carry his picture with you always . tell me everything . You 'II save these people . When we 're done talking , get on the transmitter , contact Matheson . cavalry rides in . That takes care of problem number one . Now comes the hard part . You think the infection 's been contained , that there 's no hitchhiker . You 're wrong . He 's riding with my best friend on earth . A guy named Gary Jones . And he 's out there . You and I don 't get after him right away , he 'II get out of my range ... ... and some kind of shit is gonna hit the planetary fan . Our nightmare hitchhiker . And all Dr. Mystery wants is a free pass so he can catch his friend . - Very convenient . - I 'm saying you ought to hear his story . Okay . Where is he ? Had him taken to the tractor shed . Okay . I 'II check him out and we can compare notes . Whatever you say , boss . Come on , come on . Time 's a-wasting . AII right , lad , open up . Dr. Boston ? Are you in here ? I 'm here . Where I 've been put . A prisoner on my own damn property . Let 's go ! Come on , Iet 's go . Get in ! You almost ran me down . Figured you 'd read my mind and get out of the way . Blue Unit , stand down . You are under regular Army command . Put down your weapons at once . Your mission is rescinded . This is no longer a Blue Unit operation . Put down your arms . Repeat , put down your arms . General Matheson has assumed command . Okay , Owen . Okay . You just drove over the Curtis line . - Where we going ? - South . AII I know right now . Just get me in range of Jonesy ... ... we 'II know everything we need to know . That 's some gun . Can I have a look ? - Kind of flashy for a guy like you . - It 's a gift . I know . Where are you , Jonesy ? Pick up the phone . call 1 - 800-HENRY . hello ? Jonesy ! Jesus Christ , I knew it was you . Where 's he taking you ? Massachusetts ? He is ? Duddits ? Okay , I will . You hang in there , Jonesy . Jonesy ? He hung up . Give me back my gun . - We gotta go to Derry . - That where they 're going ? No , they 're going towards Massachusetts . We need Duddits . Jonesy says Mr. Gray is afraid of Duddits . Your buddy , he 's still alive after all this time with Mr. Gray ? Yeah , he 's immune . I think it 's because he died . He got hit by a car and his heart stopped . Twice . I don 't think he even knows it . He came back from the dead . Must have changed him somehow . It 's almost like Duddits saw this whole thing coming . Is that it ? Jonesy told me it was Duddits who drew him into the accident . If we catch him , we 're gonna have to kill him . You know we have to do it . It 's the only way to stop Mr. Gray ... ... assuming we can catch him . When was the Iast time you saw Duddits ? Long time ago . Years . What makes you so sure he can help ? Duddits can do anything . I didn 't understand that then , but I think it 's always been true . He 's the one who made us like this . - Like what ? - You know , weird . He 's been waiting for you . blizzard slowed us up . Henny , Henny . Henny . I miss you , Henny . I miss you . Henny . Long time , Henny . - My God , Roberta , what is it ? - Lymphocytic leukemia . I 'm gonna let you take him , but I have to tell you why . Just now , when he was getting ready ... ... Henry , he was so excited . Like he hasn 't been in such a Iong time . I think ... ... that if he 's with you , he might die happy ... ... instead of in this awful room . Be sure the parka stays on tight . cold devastates him . The medication and instructions are in here . Bye , Mom . Goodbye , Duddie . Be a good boy . Now , go save the world . AII right , Iaddie . They haven 't got enough courage to take my trailer . Not yet , anyway . What 've we got ? They 're leaving Derry , Maine , heading south on 95 . Toward Massachusetts . Massachusetts ? Stay with it , bucko . general Matheson . Come in , please . This is very nice , Abe . Been home through some rough times . Was there something we hadn 't covered ? I don 't think I got to say before how much I respect the work you 've done . It was with sincere regret- - Herman- - May I call you Herman ? We may not agree on all the strategic initiatives , but we do agree on this : I 'm past it . Burned out . Just needed a push , that 's all . should have quit after that mess in Montana . Even I don 't trust my judgment anymore . Oh , yeah ... . My techies tell me we 're getting some electronics reading hot from in here . Yes , I 've been talking to the wife on my sat phone . I don 't know if you 've ever met Barbara . She 's been after me for years to retire . She 's very happy , I can tell you that . I 'II have everything shut down in an hour . If that 's soon enough . That will be fine . How do you turn off the goddamn lights ? Maybe you shouldn ' t have been so fast to kill that trooper . You 're making yourself at home . You have no idea , Jonesy . tell me how you Iike this : " Maybe you shouldn 't have been so fast to kill that trooper . " Not bad ? Oh , don 't like that , Gary , do you ? Ownzy . He 's in a police car now . He 's in a police car now . Can you see where they are , Duds ? Ownzy . He 's in Ister Gay . Mr. Gray . That 's right , Duds , he is in Mr. Gray . " Ister Gay " is Mr. Gray . We gotta save this girl . Save the world ? Not the world , Duds , a girl . We 'II save the world some other time . Ister Gay ? You already knew . Where 's he going , Duds ? Where is Mr. Gray taking Jonesy ? Ister Gay , he want war . - War ? - Not war , water . Mr. Gray wants water . I know where he 's going . - He 's going to the Quabbin Reservoir . - What 's Quabbin ? It supplies drinking water for all of Boston . What ? One worm kills the world . One worm kills the world ? Oh , my God . One worm . Back at our cabin , I saw the worms that come out of these weasels . Mr. Gray must want to get one into the Boston drinking supply . Just one worm infects the whole world ? - Are we going right ? - Yes . Take the 495 to the Mass Pike . It 's not far . You 're doing great , buddy . Are you ready to try something hard ? I want to ask you something hard . Yes , Henny . Good . Can you talk to Jonesy ? Can you make him hear you ? Ownzy ... ... and Ister Gay . Duddits . I knew it . I knew it . He 's been here all along . Waiting . Jonesy ? It appears we didn 't meet by accident . We owe it to our friend , Duddits . - I don ' t know what you mean . - No ? Maybe not . Maybe your clever friend didn 't want you to know what he was up to . That 's why you had nothing in the warehouse about me . Duddits didn 't bother to tell you what job he had in mind for you . It doesn 't matter . His little scheme didn 't work . Did it , Ike ? No , no . We 're almost there . What was it your poetry file had to say ? I have promises to keep And miles to go before I sleep And miles to go before I sleep Stop that chopper ! Punch it , dude . Don ' t be a pussy . Thank you , Gary Jones . Go up around the reservoir . Aqueduct to Boston starts in Shaft 1 2 . Patience , bambino . Just up ahead . Stay here and take care of your friend . No matter what you hear . So long , doctor . Good doggy . Good girl . Shit ! You son of a bitch ! Wait . Wait . Go back to car , Duddie . You 'II be safer there . Look out , Jonesy . I knew you 'd come , Henry . I knew you wouldn 't let me die . Who the fuck are you ? - Don 't you know me , H ? - I don 't know . I think I 'm gonna have to shoot you . Just to be sure . well , maybe you 're right , my friend . I don 't know myself if Mr. Gray is gone . He could be hiding in here somewhere ... ... waiting for his chance . tell me something Mr. Gray couldn 't possibly know . tell me something only we would know . SSDD . Not good enough . well , you decide . Ask me anything . At Tracker Brothers , day we met Duddits ... ... what was painted on the wall by the window ? No ... ... bounce... . No play . hello ... ... Ister Gay . You . Ooby-Ooby-Doo ... ... we got some work to do now . Ister Gay ... ... go away . No ! I Duddits . H ? Jonesy . Jonesy , if that really is your name ... . - That 'II be 50 small . - bullshit . - I Duddits . - I Duddits . They 're my friends . We 're all best friends . Here 's to Duddits , our dreamcatcher . subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH ]

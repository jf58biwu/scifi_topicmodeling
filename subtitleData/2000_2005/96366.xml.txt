 This is Mr. Mathison . He 's a doctor . Are you okay ? An ambulance is on the way . Thank you . Is there a name yet ? Elijah . Is he supposed to be crying like this ? May I ? Can I have him back ? What happened during the delivery ? Nothing . It was very quick . The baby just wanted to come right out . There were no problems . Did you drop him ? What ? Did you drop this baby ? Jesus Christ , no . Inform the ambulance that we have a situation . All right . Molly . I 've never seen ... this . It appears that your baby has sustained some fractures while inside your uterus . His arms and his legs are broken . This is Eastrail 177 . Next stop , Philadelphia . Are you alone ? Yeah . Yeah . Someone left this magazine . Want to take a look at it ? Can I take a look at that one ? Thanks . You like sports ? It 's my field . I represent athletes . I 'm an agent . Are you looking for any male synchronized swimmers ? I 'm thinking about getting into that . Is that right ? I 'm afraid of water . Think that 's a problem ? You represent someone in Philadelphia ? I 'm meeting this player from Temple University . He 's a cornerback . This kid is 6 ' 1 " , 210 pounds . He runs a 40 in 4.3 seconds . He 's gonna be a god . Do you like football ? Not really . I 'm David Dunn . Kelly . Hi . Hi , nice to meet you . Nice ... Nice to meet you . How long are you gonna be in Philadelphia ? I 'm married . Great . I 'm sorry . What are you talking about ? I ... I think you misunderstood . What I was , uh ... S-saying ... I know . I think I 'm going to find another seat . I ... I didn 't mean , uh ... That 's what he fail to realize . I look classy , not trashy . Woman : I look classy , too . What about me ? Don 't I look classy ? But I 'm afraid you forgot ... this ! And this ! Male Voice : Where has you been , Banana ? Now I 've got you , weasel . Some cars are still on fire , and the debris is everywhere . We are not sure at this time how rescue personnel will be able to get on scene at all . Second Reporter : If you 're just tuning in , Eastrail train number 177 has derailed just outside Philadelphia . And we 're bringing you live coverage from Skycam 4 . Yes , that appears to be a rescue ambulance , and there are more behind it . I can see on the access road . I don 't know how close they 're gonna be able to get , David . These are woods and , uh , trees . Uh , it 's gonna be a very difficult rescue effort . Hack some of that off . Hi . I 'm Dr. Dubin . You 're in the emergency room in the Philadelphia City Hospital . You were in a serious accident . Look at me . How are you feeling ? Okay . Good . I 'm going to ask you some questions . Have you ever had any heart or asthma problems in the past ? No . Kidney or renal problems ? No . Any allergies ? No . Where were you sitting on the train ? Against the window . In the passenger car ? Yeah . Where are the other passengers ? Was your family traveling with you ? No . Did you get up from your seat ? Are you certain you were in the passenger car ? Yes . Why are you looking at me like that ? Your train derailed . Some kind of malfunction . They only found 2 people alive so far . ER Doctor : You and this man . His skull was cracked open and most of his left side was crushed . And to answer your question , there are 2 reasons why I 'm looking at you like this . One , because it seems in a few minutes that you will officially be the only survivor of this train wreck . And two ... because you didn 't break one bone . You don 't have a scratch on you . David ? What happened ... in New York ? I don 't think I got the job . I 'm still going , uh ... I 'm still moving there . Just ... Oh , just ... just not now . Good night . Good night . Sara Elaston ... social worker at Broad and Locust Community Center . We pray for your soul . Kevin Elliot , businessman , father of 6 . We pray for your soul . Glen Stevens ... researcher in the area of leukemia ... at Drexel University . We pray for your soul . Jennifer Pennyman ... Third-grade teacher at Jefferson Elementary . We pray for your soul . Yes ? Is Noel in , ma 'am ? No , sir , he is not . I read about you in the paper . What ? I was in an accident once , too . A horse almost trampled me to death . Wow . Had him put down . That 's a sad story . Could you ask Noel something for me , please ? Proceed . Would you ask him to check how many sick days I 've taken since I 've worked here ? That the entire message ? Yes , ma 'am . Thank you . Hey , Noel . What , you hit your head on that train ? Get your brain to start working again ? What ? $ 40 . $ 40 what ? You 're getting a $ 40-a-week raise . That 's it . I checked . You were right . You 've never taken a sick day . 5 years , no sick day . I get it . You want a raise . Smart way to make your point . Is Joseph okay ? Yeah . He 's asleep . Oh . Uh ... I wanted to ask you a question . It 's gonna sound a little strange , but , uh , just think about it for a second , okay ? Okay . When 's the last time I was sick ? Do you remember ? Um , I don 't know . It 's been a while . I haven 't been sick this year , I know that . Okay . Do you remember me getting sick ? Um ... not a specific day . What ... What 's this about ? Audrey , do you remember me ever getting sick ? In the 3 years we lived in this house ? In the old apartment ? BeforeJoseph was born ? Before we ever got married ? I ... I can 't remember . Don 't you think that 's kind of weird , not remembering one cold or a fever or a sore throat ? What do you think it means ? Um ... I think it means probably too tired to remember . No more sitting in this room . I let it go on long enough . I 'm not going out there anymore . I 'm not getting hurt again . This was the last time , I told you . You can 't do anything about that . You might fall between this chair and that televisión . If that 's what God has planned for you , that 's what 's gonna happen . You can 't hide from it sitting in a room . They call me Mr. Glass at school because I break like glass . You make this decisión now ... to be afraid ... and you will never turn back . Your whole life , you will always be afraid . I got a present for you . Why ? Forget why . You want it or not ? Well , go get it , then . Where is it ? On a bench ... across the street . Someone 's going to take it . Then you better get out there soon . I bought a whole bunch . There 'll be one of these waiting for you every time you want to come out here . They say this one has a surprise ending . This is from Fritz Campion 's own library . This is before the first issue of the comic book hit the stands in 1968 . It 's a classic depiction of good vs. Evil . Notice the square jaw of Slayer , common in most comic heroes . And the slightly disproportionate size ofJaguaro 's head to his body . This again is common , but only in villains . Mm-hmm . The thing to notice about this piece , the thing that makes it very , very special is its realistic depiction of its figures . When the characters reached the magazine , they were exaggerated ... as always happens . This is vintage . Well ... wrap it up . You 've made a considerably wise decisión . Well , my kid 's gonna go berserk . Once again , please ? My son Jeb ... it 's a gift for him . How old is Jeb ? He 's 4 . No . No , no , no , no , no . You need to go . Now . What ... What 'd I say ? Do you see any Teletubbies in here ? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it ? Did you see a little Asian child with a blank expressión sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it ? No ? Well , that 's what you see at a toy store , and you must think you 're in a toy store , because you 're here shopping for an infant named Jeb . Now , one of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person 's valuable time . This is an art gallery , my friend , and this ... is a piece of art . We 're by appointment only . I got a card from this store . Congratulations , you have a mailbox . The exhibition isn 't for 2 weeks . This one was under the windshield wiper of my car . How certain are you that you 've never taken ill ? 75 % . Well ... that 's not certain at all , is it ? That 's hole number one . I 'm going to be extremely skeptical about all this . About all what ? I 'm assuming you 've never been injured . Would I be wrong in that assumption ? Dad 's been injured . Is the child correct ? Yes , sir . In college , I was in a car accident . Was it serious ? He couldn 't play football anymore . That 's hole number 2 . That 's a big one . Mr. Price , can we talk about the note that you left on my car ? I 've studied the form of comics intimately . I 've spent a third of my life in a hospital bed with nothing else to do but read . I believe comics are our last link to an ancient way of passing on history . The Egyptians drew on the walls . Countries all over the world still pass on knowledge through pictorial forms . I believe comics are a form of history that someone somewhere felt or experienced . Then , of course , those experiences and that history got chewed up in the commercial machine , got jazzed up , made titillating , cartooned for the sale rack . This city has seen its share of disasters . I watched the aftermath of that plane crash . I watched the carnage of the hotel fire . I watched the news waiting to hear a very specific combination of words , but they never came . Then one day I saw a news story about a train accident , and I heard them . " There is a sole survivor , and he is miraculously unharmed . " I have something called osteogenesis imperfecta . It 's a genetic disorder . I don 't make a particular protein very well , and it makes my bones very low in density . Very easy to break . I 've had 54 breaks in my life , and I have the tamest versión of this disorder , type one . There are type 2 , type 3 , type 4 . Type 4s don 't last very long . So that 's how it popped into my head . If there is someone like me in the world , and I 'm at one end of the spectrum , couldn 't there be someone else the opposite of me at the other end ? Someone who doesn 't get sick , who doesn 't get hurt like the rest of us ? And he probably doesn 't even know it . The kind of person these stories are about . A person put here to protect the rest of us . To guard us . You think my dad 's a real ... I don 't think anything right now . It 's a possibility ... one with many holes . Joseph , don 't take another sip of that water . Go throw it in the trash . But , Dad ... Do it now , please . I see guys like you all the time in my work . You find someone you want to take advantage of , you tell them a fantastic story , and somewhere in there you say it ... " I just need your credit card number ... a small down payment . " This morning was the first morning that I could remember that I didn 't open my eyes and feel ... sadness . I thought the person that wrote that note had an answer for me . I 'm gonna leave now . Good luck with your exhibition . So , what kind of job do you have , David ? You said you 've met guys like me in your work . What exactly is it that you do ? I work at the University Stadium . I 'm a security guard . Hi . I 've come to a decisión . Okay . I just want to ask you something , okay ? And you can be totally honest . I 'm prepared for any answer , and ... and it won 't affect me . Have you been with anyone ? I mean , since we 've been having problems . The answer won 't affect me . I just need to know , you know ? It won 't affect me either way . No . Sorry , David . Sorry . Anyway ... my decisión is ... That I want to start again . That I want it to be like it was in the beginning . And it 's a big deal that you walked away from that train . I feel like it 's a second chance . And if you feel like asking me out sometime , it 'd be okay . Okay . Jenkins : Dunn . Go for Dunn . Jenkins : It 's Jenkins . Look , we got a guy over at gate 17-C with a bogus ticket . Says he knows you . He won 't tell me his name . What 's he look like ? Why is it , do you think , that of all the professions in the world , you chose protection ? You are a very strange man . You could have been a tax accountant . You could have owned your own gym . You could 've opened a chain of restaurants . You could 've done one of 10,000 things , but in the end , you chose to protect people . You made that decisión , and I find that very , very interesting . Now all I need is your credit card number . That last part was a joke . You 're a big sports fan , are you ? It 's starting to intrigue me . It gets heaviest 10 minutes before kickoff . Program here . Program . Program . Program . Rich , why don 't we pat down ? Right . Just give me a minute . Is there a problem ? I 'm sorry , I 'm gonna have to search you . The tall guy in the camouflage jacket . Sometimes people carry weapons in here , And they drink too much . If the team 's not doing good , bad things can happen . We do pat-downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying . If he 's carrying , he 'll step out of line . Yeah , to the right up here . Okay . I got you a seat up in the yellow section . It 's in the nosebleeds , but at least you won 't get spit on . All right . How 'd you know that guy you bumped was carrying a weapon ? I don 't know . Maybe it was that camouflage army jacket he was wearing . Those guys like to carry hunting knives and stuff for show . You thought he was carrying a knife ? I thought he was carrying something , yeah . But not a knife . I got a ... picture of a silver gun with a black grip tucked in his pants . You know , like on TV . You have good instincts for things like that ? Like what ? Knowing when people have done something wrong . Yeah . Have you ever tried to develop it ? I don 't know what you 're asking me . Your skill . Look , I got to be down on the sidelines during the game . You can get to your seat right down here ... Characters in comics are often attributed special powers ... invisibility , X - Ray visión , things of that sort . Okay . I don 't want to play this game anymore . It 's an exaggeration of the truth . Maybe it 's based on something as simple as instinct . But he might not have been carrying anything . But he might have been carrying a silver gun with a black grip tucked in his pants . Jenkins Over Radio : Dunn . I gotta go . Yeah , I know . I 'll be right down . One last question . What ? That car accident you were in . Was there anyone else involved ? Yeah . My wife Audrey . She was in the car with me . Have a good life , Elijah . Next time , try to buy your tickets at an authorized sales location . I 'm on my way . Radio Announcer : ... into the investigation of train 177 being conducted at the Eastrail holding warehouses . The city council has stepped up plans to pass a bill ... Requiring higher standards for inspection and maintenance of all rail transportation in Philadelphia and its outlying districts . Hold up a second ! I just want to ask you something . Aah ! Dad ! Hey , Dad ! Dad ! Joseph , do you know how mad your mother would be if she knew you were playing football ? Are you gonna tell ? You want to play last of the downs ? We got a big guy like you . You could play on opposite sides . He 's Potter 's cousin . He 's starting cornerback at Temple University . He 's going pro in the draft . They say he can run the 40 in 4.3 seconds . I 've heard . You can beat him , Dad . Let 's beat ' em . I 'm gonna go in . Just play one set of downs . I told them you were great . Why 'd you do that ? Just one . I 'm gonna go in . I 've got some things to do . What things ? I 'm gonna work out . I 'll help you . I don 't need ... I can 't play , guys ! I 'm working out with my dad ! Hut ! You 're doing good . Right there ! Catch ! Allman Brothers : # I 've got to run # # To keep from hiding # # And I 'm bound # # To keep on riding # # And I 've got one more silver dollar # How much did you put on there ? # But I 'm not gonna let them catch me , no # # Not gonna let ' em catch the midnight rider # You put too much . That 's 250 pounds . How much can you lift ? That 's the most I ever lifted . That could 've been dangerous , Joseph . Why don 't you go upstairs now and let me finish up , okay ? I 'll take it off . I 'll help you right . You think you could have beaten up Bruce Lee ? No . I mean , if you knew karate . No . What if he wasn 't allowed to kick , and you were really mad at him ? No , Joseph . How much did you take off ? I lied . You added ? How much is it ? 270 pounds . Let 's put more . Okay . Why don 't you move back a little just to be safe , okay ? More ? You should never do anything like this . You know that , right ? What do you do if something bad happens ? Get Mom . Right . How much did you put on that time ? All of it . What else can we use ? How much is it ? How much is it , Dad ? About 350 pounds . Fracture of the fifth metacarpal of the right hand , as well as multiple fractures of the sixth , seventh , and eighth ribs . The worst of the injury , however , was sustained to the right leg in the form of a spiral fracture . There were 14 breaks . It simply shattered . They call me Mr. Glass . Who does ? Kids . Are you all right , Mr. Price ? Shall I continue ? Pins were placed throughout the length of the leg . The use of a wheelchair will be needed for a 2-month period . The use of crutches will follow for 12 to 14 months . Hospital stay will range from 5 to 8 days followed by 9 to 12 months of physical therapy . Prescribed medication for pain management will take the usual forms of morphine drip , percocet , darvocet . Your 10 : 00 is here . The hospital discharged him this morning . Thanks . Elijah , right ? We 're gonna prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this , and it works your quadriceps . How long have you been married ? 12 years . How 'd you get together ? I 'm a little nervous being here . I ask too many questions when I 'm nervous . A car accident . Oh . Now you 're going to have to tell me more . My husband was a star athlete in college , and we were in an accident together . Our car flipped on an icy road , and we were both injured , and he couldn 't play football anymore . And if that hadn 't happened , we probably wouldn 't have been together . How so ? I think we should talk about your rehab . You don 't have to answer if you don 't want to . So , tell me more about the quad machine . It prevents atrophy by ... I couldn 't spend my life with someone who played football . It 's pretty much that simple . And I don 't hate the game . I admire the amount of skill it involves . And like everyone else , I was in awe of the way he played it , but football , in many ways , is the opposite of what I do . You 're rewarded the more you punish your opponent . You know , it 's too much about violence , and I don 't want violence in my life . It 's not a thing many people can understand , but ... Anyway , fate stepped in with that car accident and took football out of the equation . And everyone lived happily ever after . Sort of . What part of David 's body was injured ? Who said my husband 's name was David ? Let 's just go to our seats , okay ? P.A. Announcer : Ladies and gentlemen ... P.A. Announcer : In the first half ... A 737 crashes on takeoff ... 172 die , no survivors . A hotel fire downtown ... 211 die , no survivors . An Eastrail train derails 71 / 2 miles outside the city ... 131 die , one survivor . He is unharmed . I 've spoken with your husband about his survival . I suggested a rather unbelievable possibility . Since then , I 've come to believe that possibility , however unbelievable , Is now more a probability . And what was it you suggested ? These are mediocre times , Mrs. Dunn . People are starting to lose hope . It 's hard for many to believe there are extraordinary things inside themselves as well as others . I hope you can keep an open mind . Defense ! Defense ! Defense ! Defense ! Defense ! Okay , here you go . Thanks a lot . Excuse me , sir ? Can you step out of line , please ? We 've been having some problems with people selling drugs here in the stadium . Would you mind if I check your pockets ? Raise your arms , please . Come on , raise them up . I just got here , man . Can I put my hands down now ? Man : Can I go ? Yeah . Hope you find them . Jenkins On Radio : Yo , Dunn . Yeah . I just came into the office . Your kid was hurt . Where is he ? Some play rehearsal at school . He wants you to come down there . Boy : Is that your dad ? I bet my dad could beat up your dad . No . He , uh ... he insisted we call only you , though we had some trouble tracking you down . I mean , you 're not on our list . Audrey handles this type of stuff . Oh . What type of stuff ? Joseph stuff . Do I need to put any smelly ointment on him or anything ? No , no . It 's more emotional damage ... not ... not too serious , physically . Nothing like when I sent you to the hospital . When was that ? My office was on the other side of the building back then . You don 't remember me , do you ? No , ma 'am . I had red hair . Well , you were a little younger than Joseph when it happened . Did you know that we changed the rules of conduct around the pool because of you ? The kids still tell about it like it was some sort of ghost story . " Did you know there was a kid nearly drowned in that pool ? He lay on the bottom of the pool for 5 minutes , and when they pulled him out , he was dead . " We let them tell it . It helps keep them safe . You still phobic of water ? It was Potter and another guy . They were messing with this Chinese girl in the dressing room . You can 't let bad things happen to good people , right ? That 's your code , right ? That 's the hero 's code . I tried to make them stop , but they kept pushing me down , and they wouldn 't let me get back up . I thought maybe because you 're my dad ... I thought I might be like you . I 'm not like you . You are like me . We can both get hurt . I 'm just an ordinary man . No , you 're not . Why do you keep saying that ? Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today . Jesus . He didn 't do anything . He just ... told me his theory . That 's sad , when patients get like that . They lose reality . Joseph , what the hell are you doing ? Oh , my God . You don 't believe . I 'll show you . You can 't get hurt . That gun 's not loaded . He doesn 't know where I keep the bullets . In your Rookie of the Year trophy . Joseph , did you load that gun ? You won 't get hurt . Elijah was wrong . When did he meet Elijah ? He was with me when I met him . No one believes him . Joseph , listen to me . Sometimes when people get sick or hurt for a long time , like Elijah , their mind gets hurt , too , and they start to think things that aren 't true . He told me what he thought about your father . It isn 't true . I 'll show you . Do you remember the story about ... about the boy that almost drowned in the pool ? That was me they were talking about . I almost died . That was me . - You 're lying . - I 'm not lying , okay ? I just didn 't remember it , that 's all . Joseph , you know your father was injured in college . You know that . You know all about that . Don 't do it . He 'll die , Joseph . I 'll just shoot him once . Joseph , listen to what your mot ... Don 't be scared . Joseph ... if you pull that trigger , I 'm going to leave . Do you understand ? I 'm going to go to New York . Y - You 're right . If you pull that trigger , that bullet is just going to bounce off me , and I 'm not going to be hurt , but then I 'm going to go upstairs and I 'm going to pack and I 'm going to leave for New York . Why ? Because I thought we were just starting to be friends for real , and friends will listen to each other . They don 't ... And they don 't shoot each other , d - do they , Audrey ? No shooting friends , Joseph . Joseph ... you are about to be in big trouble ! Now , I am your father , and I am telling you to put that goddamn gun down right now ! 1 ... 2 ... Ohh ! I followed the guy in the camouflage jacket . He had a silver gun with a black grip tucked in the back of his pants . Were you really injured in that car accident in college ? Because I believe you faked it . I believe you took the opportunity to end your football career , no questions asked . And I think you did it , of all things , for a woman . I guess that makes sense . Heh . Football 's , what , just 10 years , but love ... Hmm . Now , that 's forever . And that little bit of sadness in the mornings you spoke of ? I think I know what that is . Perhaps you 're not doing what you 're supposed to be doing . Most guns have a black or silver handle . I had a 50-50 shot of getting the color right . That 's not what I witnessed . Stop . Stop messing with my life , Elijah . My son almost shot me last night , because he wanted to prove you were right . I never said you couldn 't be killed . I never said that . My wife was right . There have been 3 major disasters , and you were the only one unharmed . I have been sick . When I was a kid , I spent a week in the hospital getting better from pneumonia . I almost drowned . 2 skinny little kids were fooling around in a pool dunking me , and I swallowed some water . They didn 't know it , and it almost killed me . Heroes don 't get killed like that . Normal people do , right ? I don 't need to see you anymore , okay ?

Soft and wet by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince . What ? We 're supposed to be honest . Soft and wet . That 's very interesting . Okay , my turn . When was the first time ... the thought popped into your head we might not make it ? That 's not the game . It 's the first date . There aren 't any rules . Don 't know for sure . Think carefully . What about the game ? It 's over . I won . Look , maybe it wasn 't a specific moment . Maybe it was a time ... I had a nightmare one night , and ... I didn 't wake you up so you could tell me that it was okay . I think that was the first time . Does that count ? That counts . Do you knowingly keep me and Joseph at a distance ? Yes . Why ? I don 't know . I just don 't feel right , Audrey . Something 's ... just not right . Do you resent us , David ? Resent the life you have ? I mean , there were a lot of other things you could 've done after college . These were your choices . You know , even if it meant we couldn 't have been together , I never would 've wished that injury on you . What you could do physically was a gift . I never would 've wished it to go away . You know that , right ? You had 2 calls afterJoseph went to bed . One came through while I was on the other line , but I wasn 't talking too long . There was an emergency with my sister . She tried to do her own perm , and now she looks like she stuck her head ... Who called through ? Baby-sitter : Um ... someone from New York , uh , about a security job . They want to hire you . I didn 't know you guys were moving to New York . Thanks for telling me . We weren 't all going to move . Oh . I let the answering machine pick up the other call . Great . Look , let 's just be honest here . We 're just at the beginning , and I don 't expect you or I to change the course of where our lives were headed because of one date . And if you do go to New York , we can develop this . We 'll just be forced to take it slow . And in the end , I think that 's definitely better . I mean , this is our second time around , David . I didn 't expect us to get carried away , you know . Then I guess " congratulations " is the right thing to say . David , it 's Elijah . It was so obvious . It was this one issue that brought it back for me ... Century Comics 117 . That 's where this group , the Coalition of Evil , tried to ascertain the weakness of every superhero , because they all have one , just like you . Your bones don 't break . Mine do . That 's clear . Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine . You don 't get sick . I do . That 's also clear . But for some reason , you and I react the exact same way to water . We swallow it too fast , we choke . We get some in our lungs , we drown . However unreal it may seem , we are connected , you and I. We 're on the same curve , just on opposite ends . The point of all this is we now know something we didn 't . You have a weakness ... water . It 's like your kryptonite . You hearing me , David ? Huhh ! Audrey ? Unh ! Hunh ! Aah ! Gotcha . Come on . Audrey . Audrey . Hey ! You 'll be okay . What happened ? What happened ? I thought I was ... I thought I was dead . Me , too . Is she all right ? I think her leg 's broken . Truck Driver : Are you hurt ? Hey , man , are you hurt ? Hello ? I wasn 't injured in that car accident . David . I 've never been injured , Elijah . What am I supposed to do ? Go to where people are . You won 't have to look very long . It 's all right to be afraid , David , because this part won 't be like a comic book . Real life doesn 't fit into little boxes that were drawn for it . There 's one in the first row . It 's ... It 's the second one . Yes . It 's the second one over . Oh ! Go back to Africa ! Whoo-hoo ! Hey , what 's your name ? I think you drank too much . Can I come in ? Who are you ? I like your house . Can I come in ? What is this ? No . You can 't come in . Are you sure ? What ... What are you ... Aah ! Aah ! It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . Shh , shh , shh . Shh , shh . Oh ! Blaah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Ahh ! Ahh ! Aah ! Ahh ! Ahh ! I had a bad dream . It 's over now . I don 't know . I can 't believe you 'd think that . I 'm just asking you . I 'm making French toast . I 've been thinking about Elijah Price . If he shows up again , I think we should call the police , okay ? Okay ? Okay . You were right . This is one ofJohann Davis' earliest drawings . See the villain 's eyes ? They 're larger than the other characters ' . They insinuate a slightly skewed perspective on how they see the world ... just off normal . He doesn 't look scary . Mm-hmm . That 's what I said to my son , but he says there 's always 2 kinds . There 's the soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands , and then there 's the real threat ... the brilliant and evil archenemy who fights the hero with his mind . Are you Elijah 's mother ? I am . I 'm helping him with the sale . Nice to meet you . I 'm David Dunn . He 's spoken of you . Says you 're becoming friends . We are . Looks like he 's doing good today . I 'm very proud of him . He 's come through a lot in his life ... a couple of bad spells I thought had broken him . Mm-hmm . They were bad ... but he made it . Yes , he did . He 's kind of a miracle . Yes , he is . I 'll tell him you 're here . Thank you . It has begun . Tell me something , David . When you woke up this morning , was it still there ? The sadness ? No . I think this is where we shake hands . Woman : Did you see it ? I worked in that building 25 years . I know all its secrets . Secrets ? Like if there ever was a fire on floors 1 , 2 , or 3 , everyone in that hotel would be burned alive . Passengers aren 't allowed in there . Do you know what the scariest thing is ? To not know your place in this world , to not know why you 're here . That 's ... That 's just an awful feeling . What have you done ? I almost gave up hope . There were so many times I questioned myself . You killed all those people . But I found you . So many sacrifices ... just to find you . Jesus Christ . Now that we know who you are ... I know who I am . I 'm not a mistake . It all makes sense . In a comic , you know how you can tell who the arch-villain 's going to be ? He 's the exact opposite of the hero , and most times , they 're friends , like you and me . I should 've known way back when . You know why , David ? Because of the kids . They called me Mr. Glass . This is Mr. Mathison . He 's a doctor . Are you okay ? An ambulance is on the way . Thank you . Is there a name yet ? Elijah . Is he supposed to be crying like this ? May I ? Can I have him back ? What happened during the delivery ? Nothing . It was very quick . The baby just wanted to come right out . There were no problems . Did you drop him ? What ? Did you drop this baby ? Jesus Christ , no . Inform the ambulance that we have a situation . All right . Molly . I 've never seen ... this . It appears that your baby has sustained some fractures while inside your uterus . His arms and his legs are broken . This is Eastrail 177 . Next stop , Philadelphia . Are you alone ? Yeah . Yeah . Someone left this magazine . Want to take a look at it ? Can I take a look at that one ? Thanks . You like sports ? It 's my field . I represent athletes . I 'm an agent . Are you looking for any male synchronized swimmers ? I 'm thinking about getting into that . Is that right ? I 'm afraid of water . Think that 's a problem ? You represent someone in Philadelphia ? I 'm meeting this player from Temple University . He 's a cornerback . This kid is 6 ' 1 " , 210 pounds . He runs a 40 in 4.3 seconds . He 's gonna be a god . Do you like football ? Not really . I 'm David Dunn . Kelly . Hi . Hi , nice to meet you . Nice ... Nice to meet you . How long are you gonna be in Philadelphia ? I 'm married . Great . I 'm sorry . What are you talking about ? I ... I think you misunderstood . What I was , uh ... S-saying ... I know . I think I 'm going to find another seat . I ... I didn 't mean , uh ... That 's what he fail to realize . I look classy , not trashy . Woman : I look classy , too . What about me ? Don 't I look classy ? But I 'm afraid you forgot ... this ! And this ! Male Voice : Where has you been , Banana ? Now I 've got you , weasel . Some cars are still on fire , and the debris is everywhere . We are not sure at this time how rescue personnel will be able to get on scene at all . Second Reporter : If you 're just tuning in , Eastrail train number 177 has derailed just outside Philadelphia . And we 're bringing you live coverage from Skycam 4 . Yes , that appears to be a rescue ambulance , and there are more behind it . I can see on the access road . I don 't know how close they 're gonna be able to get , David . These are woods and , uh , trees . Uh , it 's gonna be a very difficult rescue effort . Hack some of that off . Hi . I 'm Dr. Dubin . You 're in the emergency room in the Philadelphia City Hospital . You were in a serious accident . Look at me . How are you feeling ? Okay . Good . I 'm going to ask you some questions . Have you ever had any heart or asthma problems in the past ? No . Kidney or renal problems ? No . Any allergies ? No . Where were you sitting on the train ? Against the window . In the passenger car ? Yeah . Where are the other passengers ? Was your family traveling with you ? No . Did you get up from your seat ? Are you certain you were in the passenger car ? Yes . Why are you looking at me like that ? Your train derailed . Some kind of malfunction . They only found 2 people alive so far . ER Doctor : You and this man . His skull was cracked open and most of his left side was crushed . And to answer your question , there are 2 reasons why I 'm looking at you like this . One , because it seems in a few minutes that you will officially be the only survivor of this train wreck . And two ... because you didn 't break one bone . You don 't have a scratch on you . David ? What happened ... in New York ? I don 't think I got the job . I 'm still going , uh ... I 'm still moving there . Just ... Oh , just ... just not now . Good night . Good night . Sara Elaston ... social worker at Broad and Locust Community Center . We pray for your soul . Kevin Elliot , businessman , father of 6 . We pray for your soul . Glen Stevens ... researcher in the area of leukemia ... at Drexel University . We pray for your soul . Jennifer Pennyman ... Third-grade teacher at Jefferson Elementary . We pray for your soul . Yes ? Is Noel in , ma 'am ? No , sir , he is not . I read about you in the paper . What ? I was in an accident once , too . A horse almost trampled me to death . Wow . Had him put down . That 's a sad story . Could you ask Noel something for me , please ? Proceed . Would you ask him to check how many sick days I 've taken since I 've worked here ? That the entire message ? Yes , ma 'am . Thank you . Hey , Noel . What , you hit your head on that train ? Get your brain to start working again ? What ? $ 40 . $ 40 what ? You 're getting a $ 40-a-week raise . That 's it . I checked . You were right . You 've never taken a sick day . 5 years , no sick day . I get it . You want a raise . Smart way to make your point . Is Joseph okay ? Yeah . He 's asleep . Oh . Uh ... I wanted to ask you a question . It 's gonna sound a little strange , but , uh , just think about it for a second , okay ? Okay . When 's the last time I was sick ? Do you remember ? Um , I don 't know . It 's been a while . I haven 't been sick this year , I know that . Okay . Do you remember me getting sick ? Um ... not a specific day . What ... What 's this about ? Audrey , do you remember me ever getting sick ? In the 3 years we lived in this house ? In the old apartment ? BeforeJoseph was born ? Before we ever got married ? I ... I can 't remember . Don 't you think that 's kind of weird , not remembering one cold or a fever or a sore throat ? What do you think it means ? Um ... I think it means probably too tired to remember . No more sitting in this room . I let it go on long enough . I 'm not going out there anymore . I 'm not getting hurt again . This was the last time , I told you . You can 't do anything about that . You might fall between this chair and that televisión . If that 's what God has planned for you , that 's what 's gonna happen . You can 't hide from it sitting in a room . They call me Mr. Glass at school because I break like glass . You make this decisión now ... to be afraid ... and you will never turn back . Your whole life , you will always be afraid . I got a present for you . Why ? Forget why . You want it or not ? Well , go get it , then . Where is it ? On a bench ... across the street . Someone 's going to take it . Then you better get out there soon . I bought a whole bunch . There 'll be one of these waiting for you every time you want to come out here . They say this one has a surprise ending . This is from Fritz Campion 's own library . This is before the first issue of the comic book hit the stands in 1968 . It 's a classic depiction of good vs. Evil . Notice the square jaw of Slayer , common in most comic heroes . And the slightly disproportionate size ofJaguaro 's head to his body . This again is common , but only in villains . Mm-hmm . The thing to notice about this piece , the thing that makes it very , very special is its realistic depiction of its figures . When the characters reached the magazine , they were exaggerated ... as always happens . This is vintage . Well ... wrap it up . You 've made a considerably wise decisión . Well , my kid 's gonna go berserk . Once again , please ? My son Jeb ... it 's a gift for him . How old is Jeb ? He 's 4 . No . No , no , no , no , no . You need to go . Now . What ... What 'd I say ? Do you see any Teletubbies in here ? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it ? Did you see a little Asian child with a blank expressión sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it ? No ? Well , that 's what you see at a toy store , and you must think you 're in a toy store , because you 're here shopping for an infant named Jeb . Now , one of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person 's valuable time . This is an art gallery , my friend , and this ... is a piece of art . We 're by appointment only . I got a card from this store . Congratulations , you have a mailbox . The exhibition isn 't for 2 weeks . This one was under the windshield wiper of my car . How certain are you that you 've never taken ill ? 75 % . Well ... that 's not certain at all , is it ? That 's hole number one . I 'm going to be extremely skeptical about all this . About all what ? I 'm assuming you 've never been injured . Would I be wrong in that assumption ? Dad 's been injured . Is the child correct ? Yes , sir . In college , I was in a car accident . Was it serious ? He couldn 't play football anymore . That 's hole number 2 . That 's a big one . Mr. Price , can we talk about the note that you left on my car ? I 've studied the form of comics intimately . I 've spent a third of my life in a hospital bed with nothing else to do but read . I believe comics are our last link to an ancient way of passing on history . The Egyptians drew on the walls . Countries all over the world still pass on knowledge through pictorial forms . I believe comics are a form of history that someone somewhere felt or experienced . Then , of course , those experiences and that history got chewed up in the commercial machine , got jazzed up , made titillating , cartooned for the sale rack . This city has seen its share of disasters . I watched the aftermath of that plane crash . I watched the carnage of the hotel fire . I watched the news waiting to hear a very specific combination of words , but they never came . Then one day I saw a news story about a train accident , and I heard them . " There is a sole survivor , and he is miraculously unharmed . " I have something called osteogenesis imperfecta . It 's a genetic disorder . I don 't make a particular protein very well , and it makes my bones very low in density . Very easy to break . I 've had 54 breaks in my life , and I have the tamest versión of this disorder , type one . There are type 2 , type 3 , type 4 . Type 4s don 't last very long . So that 's how it popped into my head . If there is someone like me in the world , and I 'm at one end of the spectrum , couldn 't there be someone else the opposite of me at the other end ? Someone who doesn 't get sick , who doesn 't get hurt like the rest of us ? And he probably doesn 't even know it . The kind of person these stories are about . A person put here to protect the rest of us . To guard us . You think my dad 's a real ... I don 't think anything right now . It 's a possibility ... one with many holes . Joseph , don 't take another sip of that water . Go throw it in the trash . But , Dad ... Do it now , please . I see guys like you all the time in my work . You find someone you want to take advantage of , you tell them a fantastic story , and somewhere in there you say it ... " I just need your credit card number ... a small down payment . " This morning was the first morning that I could remember that I didn 't open my eyes and feel ... sadness . I thought the person that wrote that note had an answer for me . I 'm gonna leave now . Good luck with your exhibition . So , what kind of job do you have , David ? You said you 've met guys like me in your work . What exactly is it that you do ? I work at the University Stadium . I 'm a security guard . Hi . I 've come to a decisión . Okay . I just want to ask you something , okay ? And you can be totally honest . I 'm prepared for any answer , and ... and it won 't affect me . Have you been with anyone ? I mean , since we 've been having problems . The answer won 't affect me . I just need to know , you know ? It won 't affect me either way . No . Sorry , David . Sorry . Anyway ... my decisión is ... That I want to start again . That I want it to be like it was in the beginning . And it 's a big deal that you walked away from that train . I feel like it 's a second chance . And if you feel like asking me out sometime , it 'd be okay . Okay . Jenkins : Dunn . Go for Dunn . Jenkins : It 's Jenkins . Look , we got a guy over at gate 17-C with a bogus ticket . Says he knows you . He won 't tell me his name . What 's he look like ? Why is it , do you think , that of all the professions in the world , you chose protection ? You are a very strange man . You could have been a tax accountant . You could have owned your own gym . You could 've opened a chain of restaurants . You could 've done one of 10,000 things , but in the end , you chose to protect people . You made that decisión , and I find that very , very interesting . Now all I need is your credit card number . That last part was a joke . You 're a big sports fan , are you ? It 's starting to intrigue me . It gets heaviest 10 minutes before kickoff . Program here . Program . Program . Program . Rich , why don 't we pat down ? Right . Just give me a minute . Is there a problem ? I 'm sorry , I 'm gonna have to search you . The tall guy in the camouflage jacket . Sometimes people carry weapons in here , And they drink too much . If the team 's not doing good , bad things can happen . We do pat-downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying . If he 's carrying , he 'll step out of line . Yeah , to the right up here . Okay . I got you a seat up in the yellow section . It 's in the nosebleeds , but at least you won 't get spit on . All right . How 'd you know that guy you bumped was carrying a weapon ? I don 't know . Maybe it was that camouflage army jacket he was wearing . Those guys like to carry hunting knives and stuff for show . You thought he was carrying a knife ? I thought he was carrying something , yeah . But not a knife . I got a ... picture of a silver gun with a black grip tucked in his pants . You know , like on TV . You have good instincts for things like that ? Like what ? Knowing when people have done something wrong . Yeah . Have you ever tried to develop it ? I don 't know what you 're asking me . Your skill . Look , I got to be down on the sidelines during the game . You can get to your seat right down here ... Characters in comics are often attributed special powers ... invisibility , X - Ray visión , things of that sort . Okay . I don 't want to play this game anymore . It 's an exaggeration of the truth . Maybe it 's based on something as simple as instinct . But he might not have been carrying anything . But he might have been carrying a silver gun with a black grip tucked in his pants . Jenkins Over Radio : Dunn . I gotta go . Yeah , I know . I 'll be right down . One last question . What ? That car accident you were in . Was there anyone else involved ? Yeah . My wife Audrey . She was in the car with me . Have a good life , Elijah . Next time , try to buy your tickets at an authorized sales location . I 'm on my way . Radio Announcer : ... into the investigation of train 177 being conducted at the Eastrail holding warehouses . The city council has stepped up plans to pass a bill ... Requiring higher standards for inspection and maintenance of all rail transportation in Philadelphia and its outlying districts . Hold up a second ! I just want to ask you something . Aah ! Dad ! Hey , Dad ! Dad ! Joseph , do you know how mad your mother would be if she knew you were playing football ? Are you gonna tell ? You want to play last of the downs ? We got a big guy like you . You could play on opposite sides . He 's Potter 's cousin . He 's starting cornerback at Temple University . He 's going pro in the draft . They say he can run the 40 in 4.3 seconds . I 've heard . You can beat him , Dad . Let 's beat ' em . I 'm gonna go in . Just play one set of downs . I told them you were great . Why 'd you do that ? Just one . I 'm gonna go in . I 've got some things to do . What things ? I 'm gonna work out . I 'll help you . I don 't need ... I can 't play , guys ! I 'm working out with my dad ! Hut ! You 're doing good . Right there ! Catch ! Allman Brothers : # I 've got to run # # To keep from hiding # # And I 'm bound # # To keep on riding # # And I 've got one more silver dollar # How much did you put on there ? # But I 'm not gonna let them catch me , no # # Not gonna let ' em catch the midnight rider # You put too much . That 's 250 pounds . How much can you lift ? That 's the most I ever lifted . That could 've been dangerous , Joseph . Why don 't you go upstairs now and let me finish up , okay ? I 'll take it off . I 'll help you right . You think you could have beaten up Bruce Lee ? No . I mean , if you knew karate . No . What if he wasn 't allowed to kick , and you were really mad at him ? No , Joseph . How much did you take off ? I lied . You added ? How much is it ? 270 pounds . Let 's put more . Okay . Why don 't you move back a little just to be safe , okay ? More ? You should never do anything like this . You know that , right ? What do you do if something bad happens ? Get Mom . Right . How much did you put on that time ? All of it . What else can we use ? How much is it ? How much is it , Dad ? About 350 pounds . Fracture of the fifth metacarpal of the right hand , as well as multiple fractures of the sixth , seventh , and eighth ribs . The worst of the injury , however , was sustained to the right leg in the form of a spiral fracture . There were 14 breaks . It simply shattered . They call me Mr. Glass . Who does ? Kids . Are you all right , Mr. Price ? Shall I continue ? Pins were placed throughout the length of the leg . The use of a wheelchair will be needed for a 2-month period . The use of crutches will follow for 12 to 14 months . Hospital stay will range from 5 to 8 days followed by 9 to 12 months of physical therapy . Prescribed medication for pain management will take the usual forms of morphine drip , percocet , darvocet . Your 10 : 00 is here . The hospital discharged him this morning . Thanks . Elijah , right ? We 're gonna prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this , and it works your quadriceps . How long have you been married ? 12 years . How 'd you get together ? I 'm a little nervous being here . I ask too many questions when I 'm nervous . A car accident . Oh . Now you 're going to have to tell me more . My husband was a star athlete in college , and we were in an accident together . Our car flipped on an icy road , and we were both injured , and he couldn 't play football anymore . And if that hadn 't happened , we probably wouldn 't have been together . How so ? I think we should talk about your rehab . You don 't have to answer if you don 't want to . So , tell me more about the quad machine . It prevents atrophy by ... I couldn 't spend my life with someone who played football . It 's pretty much that simple . And I don 't hate the game . I admire the amount of skill it involves . And like everyone else , I was in awe of the way he played it , but football , in many ways , is the opposite of what I do . You 're rewarded the more you punish your opponent . You know , it 's too much about violence , and I don 't want violence in my life . It 's not a thing many people can understand , but ... Anyway , fate stepped in with that car accident and took football out of the equation . And everyone lived happily ever after . Sort of . What part of David 's body was injured ? Who said my husband 's name was David ? Let 's just go to our seats , okay ? P.A. Announcer : Ladies and gentlemen ... P.A. Announcer : In the first half ... A 737 crashes on takeoff ... 172 die , no survivors . A hotel fire downtown ... 211 die , no survivors . An Eastrail train derails 71 / 2 miles outside the city ... 131 die , one survivor . He is unharmed . I 've spoken with your husband about his survival . I suggested a rather unbelievable possibility . Since then , I 've come to believe that possibility , however unbelievable , Is now more a probability . And what was it you suggested ? These are mediocre times , Mrs. Dunn . People are starting to lose hope . It 's hard for many to believe there are extraordinary things inside themselves as well as others . I hope you can keep an open mind . Defense ! Defense ! Defense ! Defense ! Defense ! Okay , here you go . Thanks a lot . Excuse me , sir ? Can you step out of line , please ? We 've been having some problems with people selling drugs here in the stadium . Would you mind if I check your pockets ? Raise your arms , please . Come on , raise them up . I just got here , man . Can I put my hands down now ? Man : Can I go ? Yeah . Hope you find them . Jenkins On Radio : Yo , Dunn . Yeah . I just came into the office . Your kid was hurt . Where is he ? Some play rehearsal at school . He wants you to come down there . Boy : Is that your dad ? I bet my dad could beat up your dad . No . He , uh ... he insisted we call only you , though we had some trouble tracking you down . I mean , you 're not on our list . Audrey handles this type of stuff . Oh . What type of stuff ? Joseph stuff . Do I need to put any smelly ointment on him or anything ? No , no . It 's more emotional damage ... not ... not too serious , physically . Nothing like when I sent you to the hospital . When was that ? My office was on the other side of the building back then . You don 't remember me , do you ? No , ma 'am . I had red hair . Well , you were a little younger than Joseph when it happened . Did you know that we changed the rules of conduct around the pool because of you ? The kids still tell about it like it was some sort of ghost story . " Did you know there was a kid nearly drowned in that pool ? He lay on the bottom of the pool for 5 minutes , and when they pulled him out , he was dead . " We let them tell it . It helps keep them safe . You still phobic of water ? It was Potter and another guy . They were messing with this Chinese girl in the dressing room . You can 't let bad things happen to good people , right ? That 's your code , right ? That 's the hero 's code . I tried to make them stop , but they kept pushing me down , and they wouldn 't let me get back up . I thought maybe because you 're my dad ... I thought I might be like you . I 'm not like you . You are like me . We can both get hurt . I 'm just an ordinary man . No , you 're not . Why do you keep saying that ? Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today . Jesus . He didn 't do anything . He just ... told me his theory . That 's sad , when patients get like that . They lose reality . Joseph , what the hell are you doing ? Oh , my God . You don 't believe . I 'll show you . You can 't get hurt . That gun 's not loaded . He doesn 't know where I keep the bullets . In your Rookie of the Year trophy . Joseph , did you load that gun ? You won 't get hurt . Elijah was wrong . When did he meet Elijah ? He was with me when I met him . No one believes him . Joseph , listen to me . Sometimes when people get sick or hurt for a long time , like Elijah , their mind gets hurt , too , and they start to think things that aren 't true . He told me what he thought about your father . It isn 't true . I 'll show you . Do you remember the story about ... about the boy that almost drowned in the pool ? That was me they were talking about . I almost died . That was me . - You 're lying . - I 'm not lying , okay ? I just didn 't remember it , that 's all . Joseph , you know your father was injured in college . You know that . You know all about that . Don 't do it . He 'll die , Joseph . I 'll just shoot him once . Joseph , listen to what your mot ... Don 't be scared . Joseph ... if you pull that trigger , I 'm going to leave . Do you understand ? I 'm going to go to New York . Y - You 're right . If you pull that trigger , that bullet is just going to bounce off me , and I 'm not going to be hurt , but then I 'm going to go upstairs and I 'm going to pack and I 'm going to leave for New York . Why ? Because I thought we were just starting to be friends for real , and friends will listen to each other . They don 't ... And they don 't shoot each other , d - do they , Audrey ? No shooting friends , Joseph . Joseph ... you are about to be in big trouble ! Now , I am your father , and I am telling you to put that goddamn gun down right now ! 1 ... 2 ... Ohh ! I followed the guy in the camouflage jacket . He had a silver gun with a black grip tucked in the back of his pants . Were you really injured in that car accident in college ? Because I believe you faked it . I believe you took the opportunity to end your football career , no questions asked . And I think you did it , of all things , for a woman . I guess that makes sense . Heh . Football 's , what , just 10 years , but love ... Hmm . Now , that 's forever . And that little bit of sadness in the mornings you spoke of ? I think I know what that is . Perhaps you 're not doing what you 're supposed to be doing . Most guns have a black or silver handle . I had a 50-50 shot of getting the color right . That 's not what I witnessed . Stop . Stop messing with my life , Elijah . My son almost shot me last night , because he wanted to prove you were right . I never said you couldn 't be killed . I never said that . My wife was right . There have been 3 major disasters , and you were the only one unharmed . I have been sick . When I was a kid , I spent a week in the hospital getting better from pneumonia . I almost drowned . 2 skinny little kids were fooling around in a pool dunking me , and I swallowed some water . They didn 't know it , and it almost killed me . Heroes don 't get killed like that . Normal people do , right ? I don 't need to see you anymore , okay ?

I didn 't wake you up so you could tell me that it was okay . I think that was the first time . Does that count ? That counts . Do you knowingly keep me and Joseph at a distance ? Yes . Why ? I don 't know . I just don 't feel right , Audrey . Something 's ... just not right . Do you resent us , David ? Resent the life you have ? I mean , there were a lot of other things you could 've done after college . These were your choices . You know , even if it meant we couldn 't have been together , I never would 've wished that injury on you . What you could do physically was a gift . I never would 've wished it to go away . You know that , right ? You had 2 calls afterJoseph went to bed . One came through while I was on the other line , but I wasn 't talking too long . There was an emergency with my sister . She tried to do her own perm , and now she looks like she stuck her head ... Who called through ? Baby-sitter : Um ... someone from New York , uh , about a security job . They want to hire you . I didn 't know you guys were moving to New York . Thanks for telling me . We weren 't all going to move . Oh . I let the answering machine pick up the other call . Great . Look , let 's just be honest here . We 're just at the beginning , and I don 't expect you or I to change the course of where our lives were headed because of one date . And if you do go to New York , we can develop this . We 'll just be forced to take it slow . And in the end , I think that 's definitely better . I mean , this is our second time around , David . I didn 't expect us to get carried away , you know . Then I guess " congratulations " is the right thing to say . David , it 's Elijah . It was so obvious . It was this one issue that brought it back for me ... Century Comics 117 . That 's where this group , the Coalition of Evil , tried to ascertain the weakness of every superhero , because they all have one , just like you . Your bones don 't break . Mine do . That 's clear . Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine . You don 't get sick . I do . That 's also clear . But for some reason , you and I react the exact same way to water . We swallow it too fast , we choke . We get some in our lungs , we drown . However unreal it may seem , we are connected , you and I. We 're on the same curve , just on opposite ends . The point of all this is we now know something we didn 't . You have a weakness ... water . It 's like your kryptonite . You hearing me , David ? Huhh ! Audrey ? Unh ! Hunh ! Aah ! Gotcha . Come on . Audrey . Audrey . Hey ! You 'll be okay . What happened ? What happened ? I thought I was ... I thought I was dead . Me , too . Is she all right ? I think her leg 's broken . Truck Driver : Are you hurt ? Hey , man , are you hurt ? Hello ? I wasn 't injured in that car accident . David . I 've never been injured , Elijah . What am I supposed to do ? Go to where people are . You won 't have to look very long . It 's all right to be afraid , David , because this part won 't be like a comic book . Real life doesn 't fit into little boxes that were drawn for it . There 's one in the first row . It 's ... It 's the second one . Yes . It 's the second one over . Oh ! Go back to Africa ! Whoo-hoo ! Hey , what 's your name ? I think you drank too much . Can I come in ? Who are you ? I like your house . Can I come in ? What is this ? No . You can 't come in . Are you sure ? What ... What are you ... Aah ! Aah ! It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . Shh , shh , shh . Shh , shh . Oh ! Blaah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Ahh ! Ahh ! Aah ! Ahh ! Ahh ! I had a bad dream . It 's over now . I don 't know . I can 't believe you 'd think that . I 'm just asking you . I 'm making French toast . I 've been thinking about Elijah Price . If he shows up again , I think we should call the police , okay ? Okay ? Okay . You were right . This is one ofJohann Davis' earliest drawings . See the villain 's eyes ? They 're larger than the other characters ' . They insinuate a slightly skewed perspective on how they see the world ... just off normal . He doesn 't look scary . Mm-hmm . That 's what I said to my son , but he says there 's always 2 kinds . There 's the soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands , and then there 's the real threat ... the brilliant and evil archenemy who fights the hero with his mind . Are you Elijah 's mother ? I am . I 'm helping him with the sale . Nice to meet you . I 'm David Dunn . He 's spoken of you . Says you 're becoming friends . We are . Looks like he 's doing good today . I 'm very proud of him . He 's come through a lot in his life ... a couple of bad spells I thought had broken him . Mm-hmm . They were bad ... but he made it . Yes , he did . He 's kind of a miracle . Yes , he is . I 'll tell him you 're here . Thank you . It has begun . Tell me something , David . When you woke up this morning , was it still there ? The sadness ? No . I think this is where we shake hands . Woman : Did you see it ? I worked in that building 25 years . I know all its secrets . Secrets ? Like if there ever was a fire on floors 1 , 2 , or 3 , everyone in that hotel would be burned alive . Passengers aren 't allowed in there . Do you know what the scariest thing is ? To not know your place in this world , to not know why you 're here . That 's ... That 's just an awful feeling . What have you done ? I almost gave up hope . There were so many times I questioned myself . You killed all those people . But I found you . So many sacrifices ... just to find you . Jesus Christ . Now that we know who you are ... I know who I am . I 'm not a mistake . It all makes sense . In a comic , you know how you can tell who the arch-villain 's going to be ? He 's the exact opposite of the hero , and most times , they 're friends , like you and me . I should 've known way back when . You know why , David ? Because of the kids . They called me Mr. Glass .

 Mom ! Watch me ! Okay , Billy ! Mom ! You 're not watching ! Mom ! My little boy ... My Billy ... TEN YEARS LATER Mom ! Hi . Josh . I was just coming in . They know you 're supposed to wait . They 're looking for you . Who ? Who 's looking for me ? Hey , what is it ? Go look , Mom . Mrs. Underwood , we tried to call you . You must 've already left . What is everyone staring at ? What is going on ? My beautiful boy . I 'm just going to shine this light in your eyes , okay ? You 're doing great . See ? Nothing to it . - He won 't speak ? - No . - Not even to his parents . - Are they here , his parents ? Oh , they 've been here around the clock . I took his prints ... It 's him . Boy should be a teenager by now , but look at him . - Explain to me how that can be . - I can 't say , Sheriff . I 'm just here to find out who took him . I talked to everyone at school and no one saw him come back or how . The boy just come out of the blue . - Are those the case files ? - Oh , yeah . Plenty more where those came from . There 's lots of files . There 's just not much in them . We never even had a suspect . Have them set them over there , would you . Set those on that table . Well , what we 've got here is a healthy seven-year-old boy who was born 17 years ago . And a healthy boy who won 't speak . Excuse me ? Are you finished with Billy ? Mr. and Mrs. Underwood ? Um , you 're with the FBI ... Yes . I 'm Agent Scully , and this is Agent Doggett . - We are investigating this case . - It 's a miracle , isn 't it ? Mrs. Underwood whatever your son has been through , it has somehow affected his physical condition . So we 've been told by every doctor here . We just want to take him home . After ten years , can we do that ? Not yet . I want to talk to him first . How you doing , Billy ? My name 's John . I 'm gonna have a seat over here , is that okay ? Is that all right ? Billy , I want you to know that you 're not alone . I 've talked to lots of other boys and girls who 've been hurt just like you . Sometimes when they talk about it the hurt starts to go away . You want to talk about it , Billy ? You know , maybe you think bad things happened to you because you 've been a bad boy ... But I 'm here to tell you , that 's not true . The bad guy is the one who took you away and it 's up to you and me to get the bad guy . See , ' cause as big and tough as I am , I can 't do it alone . I need your help . Can you tell me about him , Billy ? What 's his name ? What did he look like ? You remember this , don 't you , Billy ? Would you like to have that back ? What is he doing ? All I want is his name . Who the hell do you think you are ? He 's only a little boy . Mr. Underwood ... ? You think this is a game ? A serious game ; one we have to win . Have you really worked kid cases before , Agent Doggett ? Child abductions ? I worked the child abduction task force . I know the horror stories , ... - ... but this kid can help us . - This isn 't just a horror story . This is a biological impossibility . Well , that 's your area of expertise . I just want to put the person who did this out of business . Billy just didn 't show up . He got away or was let go . And if he can talk , he can tell us by who . Or he can look at photos in the files and point to the man who did this so this doesn 't happen to some other little boy . You are ignoring the fact that he is still seven years old . Failure to thrive . Isn 't that the term ? I mean , aren 't there diseases that delay puberty and so on ? I told you ... he 's not sick . Good . Then he can talk . We 're home , honey . Safe at home . I 'm going to go pay the sitter , Doug . You bring Billy in . Are you glad to be home , Billy ? A lot 's new here , son . You have a younger brother now . Josh . See that big dog out there with him ? That 's Sparky . Would you like to go play with him ? - Knock it off ! - What 's the matter , Doug ? I don 't know . The dog just went off ... Sparky , what is wrong with you ? Come on , let 's go . Honey , it 's all right . He just didn 't recognize you , that 's all . He 's a nice dog , Sparky . He just doesn 't realize that you 're part of the family . But you are , Billy and we 're just so glad that you 're finally home . You going to sleep here , too ? What time is it ? I spoke with the doctors who treated Billy . - I looked at his charts . - And what , did you find something ? Yes and no . What showed up is that Billy is the same boy who was taken ten years ago . We know that . No . I mean the - same- boy . He has no cavities . He has no tooth decay . He still has four baby teeth that he 's never lost . He had a routine blood test six weeks before he disappeared in 1990 . His cell counts , his enzymes , his hormone levels , they are all exactly the same as they were ten years ago . - Now how can that be possible ? - It 's medically impossible . So , what 's the punch line ? Where are you saying he 's been ? There are X-File cases that describe similar paranormal findings . Alien abductees who came back with anomalous medical stats . You know , these words : " Anomalous " , " supernatural " , ... " paranormal ... " They purport to explain something by not explaining it . It 's lazy . I 'm not saying that I can explain it , Agent Doggett , but this is definitely not normal . I went back to the witnesses at the crime scene the day Billy vanished , to this guy , Ronald Purnell . He was detained , questioned and dismissed as a suspect . - What 's your interest in this guy ? - He 's a high school dropout , convicted of possession , arson , and shoplifting since 1990 . These are juvenile records . These are sealed by the court , Agent Doggett . We 're not supposed to have these . - And we 're at a standstill here . - Yeah , and you 're breaking the law . Look , I want to catch this guy , Agent Scully , whatever it takes . We love you so much , Billy . It 's so good to have you back- - to be tucking you in . Sleep tight . What is that supposed to mean ? It means that you 're blind to what 's going on here , Lisa . Ten years we prayed for this . Every night we prayed to God . I prayed for our son . That is not the boy I knew , Lisa . What do you expect him to be ? - They told us this will take time . - Even Josh is afraid of him . - He is nothing to be afraid of . - I wish I could believe that . How can you sit here and say these things to me ? I thought this would make us both so happy . Anybody in there ? Hello ? Ronald Purnell ? Ronald Purnell ? Yeah . Can I talk to you ? Can you come out , and we can have a conversation ? Is this about my probation ? It 's about a little boy named Billy Underwood . You know that name ? Ring a bell ? No . It does to everybody else in this area . He vanished from a school fair you were at ten years ago . You remember him now ? Yeah . I remember him . You think he 'd remember you ? - Me ? - You . Your face . You 're a trip , man . You know that ? This has nothing to do with you being stoned or violating your probation . All I 'm asking is that we go see Billy . See what he says . See what he says where ? Where ? Wherever . Wherever you want . I 'll make sure he 's there . You 're not making sense , Dude . Just leave me alone . Honey , are you here ? - What ? ! What are you doing ? ! - Joshey ! Oh , my god ! Are you hurt ? No . - You 're bleeding . - Mom ! - Where did that come from ? - I don 't know . Billy , honey what are you doing here ? Please , Billy , answer me . Just got word back from the lab . Ran the blood twice and no doubt about it . It 's the little boy 's . But I thought you said he wasn 't cut . No . You 're misunderstanding . It 's the other son I 'mdtalking about , Billy- - ... the boy who was kidnapped . - That doesn 't make any sense . - No . Billy wasn 't cut either . No , but he definitely handled the knife . His prints are on it . Where did he even get it ? His father 's never seen it before . He 's no hunter . Never cleaned an animal , which is about all a knife like that 's good for ... except for killing , of course . Well , I hate to say this but I think that the best thing for Billy and his family is if he 's removed to an institution under the observation of people who are experienced in these things . You mean , remove him ? Take him away ? After all his family 's been through ? This is not a normal child , Agent Doggett , ... - ... and this is not a normal act . - You make it sound like he 's possessed . Call the exorcist . He 's a kid- - a kid who 's been through who knows what kind of hell . Give him a chance . How do you know he 's not trying to communicate something ? And what 's the message ? Yes , he 's a kid , Agent Doggett , you 're right . He 's a kid who materialized out of thin air , unaged . Do you not somehow recognize how strange this is ? Did anybody notice this ? This symbol ? Yeah . Yeah , I was going to mention that to you ' cause it 's ... - ... kind of weird . - Weird how ? Well , like I told you , we tried everything to find that boy and who abducted him , went so far as to bring in a police psychic ten years back- - came up with that very same symbol . Well , how exactly did he come up with it ? She . Sharon Pearl . Couldn 't say how it came to her . - I 've seen this symbol before , too . - You have ? I 'll be damned . We love you so much , Billy . Whatever happened we want to put it behind us . Be a family again . And if you could help us to understand what you 're going through , we could move forward . No , we 're just going to go see a doctor , someone you might want to talk to . We 're coming right back . Nothing 's going to happen . Mommy won 't let anything happen to you . Billy , I just want you to get the help you need so we can all live here together and be happy . Okay ? Come on , sweetie . I 'll take him , Doug . If it 's such a strain on you . Look , if you think a shrink can give us some answers , fine . I just don 't want this to ruin our other son 's life in any way . Where 's Billy ? Dad ! I don 't want no more trouble here , Ronnie . Whatever you 're doing , you do it somewhere else . You ever get off your lazy ass to do anything but hassle me ? ! Watch your mouth . I got company coming and he won 't take your lip . Who ? You tell him to stay out of my face . Get away from me . Where you going , weirdo ? You steal those clothes off a fat man ? Or 'd you just shrink ? Hmm ? Hey , you going to get your butt in this trailer , traveling man ? Yeah . All depends on , uh ... what you 've got in mind . Testing , one , two , three ... This is great . Now , I 've got a psychic sitting in my living room who 's going to tell me what 's wrong with my son . I understand your misgivings , Mr. Underwood , but perhaps you can look at this as just another avenue . An avenue to what ? We 're going to solve this case , Mr. Underwood . We 're going to find out who did this to your son . And then what ? What am I left with ? A kid who stabs knives into his brother 's mattress ? You don 't know the half of it . He gives everyone but his mother the creeps with that stare of his . I just know that this is going to tear you apart . It 's going to tear your family apart . And you can 't let it . You 've got to save them from the damage this can do . I 'll be happy to save what I can . Come on , Josh . Let 's go . - Is this going to happen ? - Shouldn 't you be telling us that ? You 're no doubt confused , Agent Doggett . I take psychic readings not see through walls . Sorry to keep you waiting . Mrs. Underwood . I 'm Sharon Pearl . I consulted on your son 's disappearance back in 1990 . And you 're Billy ? Ms. Pearl ? Are you okay ? There are very powerful forces at work here . Working through this boy . Drawing him to his brother . I feel this force ... I feel this force ... You lost someone just like Billy . What 's happening to her ? Oh , my God . Hey , Fartknocker . Where are you going in such a big hurry ? What 's the matter ? Got something in your ears ? Don 't .. don 't touch me , Cal . Oh , listen to him . No wonder he wears them baggy britches . Our Ronnie 's a big man now . Your old lady said the cops came and talked to you . Hmm ? I am talking to you , not the side of your head . Better mind your Ps and Qs , Jones . Or I 'm going to tell them what you did to that little boy . I 'm going to tell them what you got buried out there in the woods . What 's going on with you two ? Talking about cars . Well , they 've got her stabilized and it looks like she 's going to be okay if you 're at all curious about her condition . I 'd be more curious if I believed it . Believed what ? The act . - You think that was an act ? - It 's pretty standard fare , isn 't it ? Float a few choice revelations , as if they came from on high , roll around on the floor . You saw that symbol appear on her forehead . It 's a damn good trick . Don 't ask me how she does it . - Agent Scully , please . - No . I think you want to hear this . Now listen to it backwards . - When you wake ... - What was that ? - ... you shall have ... - It 's a child singing . - ... all the pretty little horses ... - Lyrics . Hush-a-bye , don 't you cry go to sleep , little baby ... You hear that , under the noise ? - Now- - - What 's he doing here ? Get away from me ! Ronnie , open up the car ! Ronnie , stop the car ! Agent Scully , he 's got Billy ! Get out of the car ! Now ! Don 't move , Ronnie . Where 's Billy ? I thought you said Billy was in the car ? Where 's Billy ? I 'm going to go pay . You want anything ? Josh , are you okay , buddy ? Dad , can I ... ? Mister ? Pony ? Hey , pony . Hey , there you are . Help ! Help ! - Count to ten , Agent Doggett . - He took Billy . He couldn 't have . How are you going to back that up with Billy now missing from his home ? By the certain knowledge that not five minutes earlier , I saw him enter his home with his mother . I saw him ! I saw Billy riding in the car with Ronnie . Why else would Ronnie take off like he did ? It 's impossible , Agent Doggett , like everything else about this case . Like how Billy can be in his home one minute and then in Ronnie 's car the next . Everything about this case is impossible . This kid is the key , Agent Scully . I 've been saying that from the beginning and I 'll say it now . Agent Doggett , Agent Scully , I got bad news on top of worse . Josh , the Underwood 's other little boy , has disappeared . I 'm not joking , not even close . I got the parents out here now . I 've got to talk to this kid , Agent Scully . I 'm absolutely sure . Have a seat , Ronnie . I know what you 're going to ask but I got no answer . Well , there can be only one answer , right ? I mean , why else did you go to the house ? You went there for Billy , to get him back . No . - You had him in your car . - I don 't know how he got there . Then why go to the house at all ? Because I didn 't believe you . Mom ! You didn 't believe what ? What 's so hard to believe , Ronnie ? - You said I could talk to him . - You needed to talk to him . After all those years , you couldn 't live without him . You wanted him back . All those years , Ronnie . All those years . Where 'd you keep him ? Man , you don 't understand . You were sorry you let him go . No , I ... I couldn 't let him go . " When you wake you shall have all the pretty little horses . " Who else knew about him ? Your mom ? No . - Where 'd you keep him ? - I didn 't . - What did you do to him ? ! - I didn 't do anything . I took care of him . I sang to him you know , so he wouldn 't be afraid . Afraid of who ? Who was he afraid of , Ronnie ? Somebody else involved ? Somebody else make you do it ? He take that other kid , too ? Billy 's brother ? He take him ? You 're afraid of him , too , aren 't you ? You 're a victim , just like those other kids . Is that right ? You ... me , Billy . This is our chance , man . What 's his name ? FBI ! Cal Jeppy ! Come out ! It 's okay , Josh . You 're okay . We 're not going to hurt you . Agent Doggett ... He 's on the run . He 's in the woods ! Watch your fire ! There may be another boy ! Down on your knees ! Hands in the air ! Where 's the kid ? ! - He 's in the trailer . - Other kid ! - There 's no other kid . - Billy Underwood ! There 's no other kid . Get this man in cuffs ! Read him his rights ! The kid 's over ... I don 't believe it . Okay , the clothes , the age and condition of the bones , the location of the grave . There is no doubt that that is Billy Underwood 's skeleton ... - ... that is in that grave . - We spent time with this boy . Doctors took Billy 's blood . You examined him yourself . Now , I can 't accept it . I can 't believe we 're asking them to . I know , but the forensic evidence is going to come out , and what then ? - What if I 'm right ? - Well , what then , Agent Scully ? What we do ? We move on , let it go , case closed ? Look , I know where you are with this . I have been there . I know what you 're feeling- - that you 've failed and that you have to explain this somehow . And maybe you can . Not if that 's Billy 's body , I can 't . But maybe that 's explanation enough . That that 's not Billy 's brother lying in that grave , too . That that man who did this is never going to be able to do it again . Isn 't that what you wanted , Agent Doggett ? Agent Scully , don 't ask me to believe that this is some kind of justice from beyond the grave . All I 'm saying is that maybe you succeeded ... Whether you 're willing to see that or not .

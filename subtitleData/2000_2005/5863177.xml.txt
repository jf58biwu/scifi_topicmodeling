 Our five-day forecast . Next up , the tree girl from Elkerton . Living in a tree for an entire year ... local girl , Rianna " Hummingbird " Holmes , is finally coming down . Unlike the better known Julia Hill ... the rest of Miss Holmes ' forest was leveled ... though she did manage to save one giant redwood tree . - All right ! - How are you doing ? I just want to thank everyone who sent me ... food and letters of support . Especially the mentally handicapped child who sent me this book of poems . She read my poems ! Thank you . Dimples ! Come on in the house ! Morning , Miss De La Rosa . Dimples got out again . I let him out . Well , you have a good day now . I am a warrior . On your left . Well , boys and girls ... this is the most important room in the entire police station . This is the police evidence room . This is where I work . Are you a real policeman ? Evidence file clerks work very closely with real policemen . So you 're not a real policeman . As soon as I pass the obstacle course , I 'm gonna be a real policeman . Yeah , okay , pal . All the evidence is arranged by case number . Do you realize we 're almost as tall as you ? This field trip sucks . I think I might have some candy somewhere . Look , everyone - marijuana ! I 'm sorry . You 're not allowed to touch that . That 's police evidence . What are you gonna do - arrest us ? You 're not a real cop . Guys , that 's really - - I got him ! - Yea ! Mange ! What is going on in here ? Let me see that . Thanks , Sarge . Right there . You 're missing an " R. " There . Outstanding . Now , who wants to go for a ride with a real police officer ? - Marvin , what happened to you ? - Kids . I can 't believe you let a bunch of eight-year-old kids embarrass you . I 'm gonna really do it this time , Dad . I 'm gonna be a real policeman just like you were . I 'll make you so proud of me . I 'm not gonna be a huge loser anymore . Give me that ! - Stretch it , Marvin ! - It won 't go any further . Back up . Let me give it a shot . Come on , Marvin ! Maybe this year you won 't pee your pants and cry for your mama . - That was a good one , Sarge . - Don 't worry . Nobody remembers that . Listen up . You have four minutes to complete ... the physical endurance portion of your police examination . I have personally designed this course ... to simulate actual conditions one might encounter ... in the field . Good luck . Take a good look at that ass . You 'll be following it all day . Ready ! Set ! Go , Marvin ! Go ! Go , Marvin ! You got her ! Marvin , take her ! Kiss it ! Oh , okay . Right . How does this simulate something that would happen in the field ? Come on , Marvin ! You got it ! That 's it ! - Marvin , you okay ? - At least you didn 't pee in your pants . Maybe we should wait till everyone leaves . Pop quiz . Who 's this ? Mange ! That 's four times in a row . Refills ? Thank you . - Y 'all see that shit ? - What ? I 'm sitting in the middle , and she poured my beer first . So ? Don 't you see ? It 's because I 'm black . Maybe she 's just being nice . - See , now we 're getting to it . - What ? What y 'all call " nice , " I call reverse racism . " Let 's be overly nice to the black man . Let 's make up for his ancestors being plucked from their homeland ... crammed by the hundreds into leaky boats with no bathrooms ... like human tuna fish , and if most of them didn 't die on the way over ... they would have to go into show business to make a decent damn living . " And now she 's gonna pour my beer first ? That 's not gonna make up for 400 years of injustice . No , sir . Not today . I wish I was black . I 'd have my onion rings by now . I gotta go take a wizzer . Oh , geez , I 'm sorry . I didn 't know anybody was in here . There 's a long line in the ladies ' room . Wait . You 're Rianna " Hummingbird " Holmes . Look , I think it 's great what you did , saving that tree ... even though they leveled all those other trees . Glad to see you 're doing your part . I 'm sorry . I 'm wasting trees . They should get one of those - They should get one of those blow job by things . I mean , hand jobbies - I mean , hand blowers . Bye . I wrote you a poem . Working out and eating a high-protein diet is not enough . You need a high-potency , high-mineral , mega-amino ... anabolic body-building supplement . Nothing legally will give you all that ... except Badger Milk . A badger can lift 20 times its body weight . Can you do that ? Our potent supplement is made up of 25 % real badger milk . If you call now , you 'll get ... two cartons of Badger Milk for the price of one . Check out the pecs on Yolanda . That is pure Badger Milk . Hey , Marv , could you cover for me for a minute ? - I 'm the only one here . - No problem . Everyone else is down at the softball game . Thanks . There 's a softball game today ? Freeze , puke ! Put down that VCR ! Put it down ! Oh , you bought it , did you ? Oh , you have a receipt , do you ? My mistake . I 'm new on the force . Police Department . Can I help you ? This is Mr. Tam of Tam 's Restaurant . I 'm being robbed . Tam 's Restaurant ? That 's terrible ! I go there all the time . You guys have the best orange-flavored bean cake . - Thank you very much . - The chili peppers give it a real kick . They 're shooting at me now ! Hold on . I 'll get some help . Officers needed . I got a two-eleven . Robbery in progress . Hello ? Outstanding . Officers needed ! Hello ? Can you just sit tight until I can reach somebody ? I got a two-eleven in progress . I 'm in pursuit . Hello ? Two-eleven in progress ! That wasn 't so bad . - Thanks for the lift . - Not at all . Dimples , you okay ? The Badger Milk girl . She seems nice . Now , that 's good badger milk . - Hey , Fatty . - I gotta go . Marvin , where the hell have you been ? Well , last night after you left , I got a call . Two-eleven . Robbery in progress at Tam 's Restaurant . Marvin , it was over a week ago . You 've been missing for eight days . - What ? - I tried to cover for you . I told everyone you were an unreliable drunk who disappears for days on end . So I think you 're okay . - Thanks a lot . - Are you all right , Marvin ? Do you wanna see a doctor ? No . I feel great . - On your left . - Sure , pass the old guy , big man ! - How 's it going ? - What ? Shit ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on , boy ! Come on ! Oh , easy ! Easy ! Whoa ! Slow down . Wow . You gotta show me how you do that . I wish I knew . I 'm Marvin . I 'm Rianna . I know . I met you in the men 's room . Oh , yeah . The fart guy . So , are all these dogs yours ? Kind of . I volunteer at a pet shelter . - Oh , that 's great . - Yeah , it 's pretty cool . I get to hang out with all sorts of different animals and - At least this time I have a roof over my head . Is something wrong ? No . Nothing 's wrong . Why ? - Nice catch . - Thank you . You should come by the shelter sometime . You know , you could play Frisbee with the dogs . I 'd like that . Bye . I 'm sorry . Miles , I gotta talk to you . I didn 't know you smoked . I don 't . It 's illegal to smoke in the airports . I just wanted to show you how bad it 's gotten . Watch this . See ? Nobody even says anything to me because I 'm black . " Oh , let 's bend the rules for the black guy . Let 's let him smoke because he 's black . " Just because all those old blues musicians never got any royalties ... and had to play one-night gigs until they were , like , a hundred ... just so they could pay for their whores , and now I can smoke anywhere I want to . - Man , that 's bullshit . - Something weird happened to me . Yeah ? Well , something weird happened to me too . They made me supervisor . - That 's great . - Is it ? I 've been here 16 days , Marvin . That Filipino over there has been here five years . You know why they made me supervisor ? Because you 're black ? No . ' Cause that bitch is dumb . Excuse me , sir . I 'm in a hurry . Not until I check you with my magic wand , you ain 't . Arms out . I ordered the stuff from the TV , and I think it 's working . - Flight 32 is now boarding . - Physically , there 's - That 's odd . Do you smell that ? - It 's this way . - What is ? Trust me . I know what I 'm doing . What , are you crazy or something ? Let go of my leg ! Get off of me ! He 's got drugs on him . Check him . What are you talking about ? This guy 's clean . - He 's clean . - You see ? You can go . No , wait . Hey . I hope he 's on our flight . That 's a huge bitch ! Well , I don 't know whose that is , but that 's not mine . It 's pure heroin . You 're pretty good , buddy . What 's your name ? Mange . Marvin Mange . You 'll be hearing from us . Chief Wilson , could you tell us what happened at the airport ? The drugs were found by the newest member on our force - Marvin Mange . Here to take you through the arrest is Sergeant Doug Sisk . Thank you , sir . Ladies and gentlemen ... - the suspect flew in from Colombia - - Excuse me . I have a question for Officer Mange . Is it true that you can smell things in people 's butts ? I guess so . Can you smell things that are not in people 's butts ? Like , say , things in people 's pants pockets or wallets ? Officer Mange , I 'm from the free press . What 's up my butt ? Uh , sir , I 'd rather not . Oh , come on . What 's up there ? Car keys . - He 's good . - Over here ! - No more questions . - What about me , sir ? Over here , Officer Mange , please . Excuse me . Can I talk to you for a minute ? Look , I don 't want to guess what 's up your butt , okay ? No , it 's not that . You see , I released you ... to see if you could function normally in society . But now you 're attracting too much attention . I just can 't take the chance . - What are you talking about ? - I was the one that found you . I put you back together . Don 't you remember the animals ? Well , how do you explain your enhanced sense of smell ... your ability to run twice as fast or jump ten feet in the air ? It 's the Badger Milk . I ordered it from the TV . I need you to come with me . You 're crazy . I 'm not going anywhere with you . Sorry about the dart . I think you 'll find everything you need here - water , food , a place to work out . Where am I ? Well , you were born here , sort of . You see , when I found you , you were more dead than alive . The only way to save you was my ground breaking procedure - radical trans-species-ectomy . - What 's that mean ? - I put animal parts in you . You put wild animals inside me ? I wish . I don 't have that kind of money . Most of the animals I used were abandoned by a Mexican circus ... or came from the private zoo of a famous pop star . Why , there 's Mr. Giggles . He really misses the pop star . I 'm not allowed to say who . Your life is here with me now . Hmm ? Look , doc , I appreciate you saving me . Thank you . I think . But whatever you did with the animals is working for me . So I 'm just gonna go on with my new life . Your human side may not be able to control it . I have to go . I have to try it . I 'm sorry . I can 't allow that . Sit . Listen up , shit stains . I don 't know how you worked that balloon trick out of the guy 's ass . I don 't . But I 'm watching ya . Now , the fact of the matter is , you 're not even a full-fledged cop yet . You 're not , okay ? And until you pass your 30-day probation ... you belong to me . I 'll have you thrown out of here so quick , it 'll make your head spin . All the best . Don 't be ashamed , son . I 've eaten out of the garbage before . Yeah , this baby is nailed down tight . Not going anywhere . All righty . One minute , okay ? Give me one minute . I 'll be right back . He was trying to get out . You might want to get a cover for this . Yeah , maybe . Come on back . I 'll show you the animals . This is Molly . She 's a young turkey vulture . Hey , baby . Her parents were killed by a hunter ... and we 're having the hardest time getting her to eat . I 'm worried she 's not gonna make it . She just misses her mom , that 's all . She doesn 't eat whole worms . That was really amazing . So , what do you think ? It 's all right . He 's nice . There are a lot of animals in here . Yeah , I know . It 's a little crowded . I just don 't have the heart to turn any of them away . But it 's cool . We 're like one big , happy family . This is Henry , the orangutan . He 's very affectionate . He really likes people . He just doesn 't like other monkeys . We have quite a collection of exotic birds . Macaws and - My friend Cosmo 's a parrot . You are a good boy . Parrots are one of the smartest creatures in the animal kingdom . - Really ? - Want some food ? Want a peanut ? Yeah , it 's been proven they have the intelligence of a five-year-old child . - A five-year-old ? - People think parrots just mimic ... but I actually think they have thoughts of their own . Some of them even have a vocabulary of up to 200 words . Cosmo here has about 150 . That 's incredible . I didn 't know any of that . Hi there . Sometimes I feel like I get along better with animals than people . Animals are simple . They 're honest . You know what I mean ? I guess I kind of like people better . With animals , I just feel like I 'm one of them . Easy , boy . Do you ever feel that way ? It 's crazy . Crazy . Calm down . What 's the matter with you guys ? Guys , let me ask you a serious question . Do you ever have trouble with control ? Yes . The first thing you have to do is admit you have a problem . You have to come out and say , " I am a porn addict . " Not that kind of control . I 've been having these animal urges . Me too ! I got this one crazy video on the mating rituals of a hippopotamus . He was trying to take my meat . Hey , doc ! Dr. Wilder ! There you go . Tummy 's all gone now . Hmm . How is my boy ? I knew you 'd come home . I 'm not " coming home . " Stop it ! You 're not helping . - Sorry . - Look , doc , you were right . This control thing is a lot harder than I thought . This might help . Here . This morning , I woke up in a butcher shop . - I have no idea how I got there . - Oh , I see . The other day , I was eating out of a garbage can . I bit someone , and then ... I made love to a mailbox . Your subconscious is reverting to a primal state . That 's why I wanted you to stay here . I was so sad when you left . I thought we could be buddies . I even gave you a name . Snowball . I already have a name . Oh , Snowball already has a name , hmm ? Who 's a good boy , then ? I 'm a good boy . I 'm - This is serious ! I 'm turning into an animal here ! All right . Four whole turkeys , a dozen lamb shanks ... two salmon , my pet rabbit - Oh , Charlie . One ham hock . You see ? You didn 't want the biscuit because you satisfied your hunger . Now that I have your attention , listen carefully . You must anticipate your instincts - satisfy your animal urges before they take over . Hunger will be your biggest challenge . There 's also your sex drive . If you like , I could help you with that . That 's all right . I 'm good . I gotta go . There are a few things bothering me here . I don 't know how you got to the butcher shop break-in before I did ... but let me guarantee you something - You had damn sure better not be trying to show me up ... with any of your super cop bullshit . Not at all , sir . You got one week of probation left , Mange ... and I 'm gonna be all over you . Say " hello " to your new partner . What 's all that shit ? Supplies . I want to be prepared for anything . Of course you do . Hey , pigs . Why don 't you get the hell outta here , homes ? This is our neighborhood . You 're just a regular bad-ass , aren 't you , Mange ? Now , when did you first notice it was missing , sir ? This morning about 5 : 30 . I parked the tractor right here . Now it 's gone . Is that your goat ? Yeah , that 's Nellie . - She 's in heat , huh ? - Yeah . That 's why I got her separated from the other animals . They can 't resist her . Makes sense . Makes a lot of sense . Mange , shut up . - Now , are these tracks still fresh ? - They are . Walk me through the whereabouts of all your farmhands at the time of the crime . I 'm gonna check out something over here . How 's it going ? My name 's Marvin . You got it going on . Gears ? All of them . Have you noticed anything abnormal in the area of late ? Control , Marvin . Control . Sweetie . Yes , you make me laugh . That 's not your property ? So soft . I 'm gonna find this man - Oh , my ! Watch this , Mange . The professor is in . Take out your pen and take notes . Hey , guys . Ma 'am ... now , I really oughta be giving you a ticket for being too darn cute . But I 'll tell you what . I 'll settle for taking you out for a drink on Saturday night . - What do you say ? - Maybe another time . I already have a date ... with Marvin . Right , Marvin ? Yeah . I forgot . I 'm picking her up at 8 : 00 ? Dinner and a walk . I 'll see you then . A walk . I got an idea . Why don 't I take you for a walk down to the women 's store ... so I can get you a blouse to go along with the meter maid outfit ... you 're gonna be wearing from now on , 'cause that 's your new job ! Get in the car ! Now , this is the mayor 's annual charity event . I want you to keep a low profile . Got it ? - Got it . - How are my teeth ? - Great . - Good . That 's far enough , shit stains . I don 't want you anywhere near the mayor or his guests . You got me ? I 'll be a good boy . And for God 's sake , keep your shirt on . I would like to thank everyone here ... for the success of this fund-raiser . The fire department is going to love their new equipment . - Outstanding ! - Hi , Daddy . Hi , sweetheart . Where are you off to ? You keep an eye on him . - Yes , sir . - That is one handsome little fellow . Bacon-wrapped shrimp ? Oh , thank you . Hey , there he is . How are you ? I am so sorry , Mr. Mayor . Aren 't you that drug-sniffing cop ? Yes , sir . It 's a fur ball . Sir , this officer 's been on probation . He obviously failed . He 's off the force as of now . Do you hear that ? You all right ? You know , you scared your old man . Wonderful ! Chief , this is one fine cop you 've got here . Yes , it is . Yeah . - Hey , there he is . - Hey , listen up ! A toast ! To the newest cop on the force , baby ! Go , Aquaman ! - Outstanding ! - You 're all right , man . - You 're all right . - Right there . Go . So you were really able to hear that kid drowning from that far away ? - Yeah . - All right . Then what am I saying now ? You were born with only one testicle . You keep that shit to yourself . I 'm just worried about my date with the tree girl . I don 't know if it 's gonna work out . She 's a man , isn 't she ? I knew it when you met her in the men 's room . I have to tell you guys something . I got into a terrible car crash in the mountains . Some scientist found me and put me back together with different animal parts . Now I can 't control my sexual urges . If you don 't wanna hang out with me because I 'm black , just let me know . Yeah . I hope you like vegetarian . I love it . Look at her . And look at the disaster she 's with . They make it so easy for us . Thanks for helping me out with Sergeant Sisk . No , it was no problem . I wasn 't sure if you really meant it . Of course I did . Yeah ? So , how are the animals doing over at the shelter ? I started feeling bad about the lack of space ... so I started to bring some of the animals home with me . Maybe I 'm crazy . I don 't think so . I think you 're pretty amazing . - No , I 'm not . - Yes , you are . You know , there 's something about you , Marvin . I cannot figure it out . How is your grilled eggplant ? - Nice , huh ? - Yes , it 's lovely . Thank you . You are the lovely one . - Where 's the bathroom ? - Next to the bar . Great . Thank you . Excuse me for a second . Do you smell that ? It 's kind of musty . Asparagus , next table . Oh , you have a little - - Oh . - I 'll get it . That was either the nicest thing that 's ever happened to me ... or the grossest . - Will you excuse me for a minute ? - Of course . - Sorry . - I ordered us some sorbet . Great . Will you excuse me again , please ? There you go . Oh , thank you . Wow . That 's such a beautiful necklace you have . - Thanks . - Did you get that in Italy ? - Yes , in Florence . - I am from Firenze . My family lives there . You stay with them . I 'll give you my number . Call me . Tony , I 'm gonna have a smoke . What ever happened to that waiter ? I guess he was done with his shift or something . Thanks for the walk . No . Thank you for dinner . It was great . So , can I invite you in ? It 's been such a perfect evening . I 'd hate to ruin it by attacking you . Well , that 's honest . So , I guess this is good night . Good night . Tomorrow , we 're releasing Molly the turkey vulture back into the wild . You should come by . I wouldn 't miss it . Okay . Good night . I 've never seen anything like it . There was blood , guts everywhere . There was nothing left of that cow ! It even ate most of the hooves . I 'm telling you , chief , there 's some kind of a beast out there . All the other cows are too afraid to eat or shit . And they ain 't got nothing else . I 'm gonna have an officer drive you home , you hear ? All I want you to do is just take care of your cows . I 'm gonna go put on a puppet show for ' em . - Maybe that 'll calm ' em down . - Marvin . Can I see you in my office for a minute ? That was Bob Harris . Last night a couple of his cows got all torn up . Looks to me like it might be one of those satanic rituals . Do you worship the dark lord ? No , sir . Help yourself . Bob got a look at a man running away from the scene . We made a composite ... from his description . Do you recall ... where you were last night between midnight and 5 : 00 A.M. ? I was sleeping , sir . Do you have ... anyone who can corroborate that ? No , sir . Can you explain why that drawing ... looks like you , Marvin ? I 'm going to have to ask you to go on paid leave until we figure this out . I 'm also going to have to ask you to teach me how you do that . Sorry , Dad . Is that a beaver dam ? What 's happening to you ? Look , you have to go . You can trust me . Only an animal would do something like that . There must be some other explanation . I know you , and you wouldn 't hurt anyone or anything . It 's getting late . You can 't stay here much longer . I 'm not going anywhere . You 're not dangerous ... and I 'm gonna stay here tonight to prove it to you . It 's not safe . At night , I lose control . What are you doing ? I have no idea . Knock it off . If you 're gonna stay here , at least tie me up . What ? I want you to tie me up ... so that I won 't hurt anybody . My handcuffs ! You looked so uncomfortable . When did you take them off ? I don 't remember . You wore them for a while ... and then I wore them for a while . You are an animal . I am ? Awesome ! Marvin , go ! This is Chief Wilson . Last night , a hunter was attacked ! Mange ! We know about the barn ! Marvin , you gotta get outta here ! Marvin , get out ! - The freak show 's over . Come with me ! - Go ! Freeze ! Super cop Marvin Mange has turned fugitive today . He 's wanted for the assault of a bird hunter , and the attack of two cows . The suspect is considered dangerous ... and Elkerton Police Chief Marion Wilson is assembling ... a task force of the city 's finest officers . Ladies and gentlemen ... our suspect is not human . He is at home in the bush . Shoot to kill . Any questions ? Yeah , I got a question there . When do we get to light our torches ? - When it gets dark . - I see . I got another question there . Suppose , hypothetically , you know ... a guy had already lit his torch . It 'd be cool if he could just keep it lit , huh ? Yes . Oh , excellent . Excellent . Now , if there are no more questions - I got another question . If one part of the mob gets separated from another part of the mob ... shouldn 't there be a place that we can get together ? Maybe a secret place the two mobs could reunite , and we 'd be a big mob again . - Stay with the mob . - Stay with the mob . All right . - Right . - Hey ! I got another question . Doesn 't this guy deserve a fair trial ? You - back of the mob . " Back of the mob " ? What ? This is my spot ! I came early ! Okay , out of the mob ! Ah , this mob blows . Let 's go . - What are you doing out here ? - Picking apples . With a dart gun ? I made a terrible mistake ... and now I must correct it . There 's something else out here , isn 't there ? It was the same experimental procedure as yours . I don 't understand what went wrong . We have to catch it before it 's too late . Until then ... we are all in danger . Right here is exactly why black people don 't go camping . I could just as easily have something crawl up my ass at home . I have to eat . You need to start carrying Power Bars with you , ' cause this is some bullshit . Sorry , Miles . I have to eat . Oh , my God . You scared me . You shouldn 't be out here . There 's a crazy man-beast in the woods . Damn . Go . Go ! You 're the only one that can stop it now . On your left , on your left ! I love berries . Are you done yet ? You 're mine ! Like that , huh ? Come on , baby . Mange ! What ? Come on . I got ya . Reach for it . Why did you save me ? Like I told you ... I 'm not an animal . Wish I could take that chance . You . That hunter was after my turkey vulture . I had to scare him off . I guess we have the same doctor . I hope this doesn 't change anything between us . So that 's why you have six nipples . The damn tree girl is the beast . Two beasts kissing - that 's hot . - Kill the beast ! Kill him ! - Kill him ! Take your dirty paws off her ! It 's time to die , man-beast ! You can do it ! Cut his freaking balls off ! . I 'm not a beast ! - I 'm not a beast ! - Then who is the beast ? Kill the beast ! All right , all right ! It 's me ! I was not expecting that . Were you ? I am the beast . I ate the cow , and I mauled the hunter . So , do what you gotta do . Well , I guess we can let it go this time . - Yeah , it 's no big deal . - What ? I 'm won 't be part of a mob to kill a black guy , I 'll tell ya that . Let 's move it out , people . It 's all over . These pantyhose are killing me . Come on . Come on , all of you . " Let 's let the black beast go free just ' cause he 's black ! We can 't kill the black man-beast . That would be racist . " Way to go , buddy . What is the matter with you people ? Come on , guys ! Time for dinner ! I wonder who they 're gonna take after . I got a feeling they 're probably gonna take after their dad . Yeah ? It could fall out . Thank you dearly for this most prestigious award . Winning this Nobel Prize ... truly validates a lifetime of hard work . But I really owe it all to one special person . And that person ... is my fiancee , Yolanda . It 's the Badger Milk girl . I guess there really is someone for everybody ... even if you have to make ' em out of animal parts . You think so ? What ? What ? I 'm just looking . That 's a huge bitch !

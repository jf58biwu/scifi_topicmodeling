 Previously on Farscape . The ability to create a stable wormhole . Travel through space and time , would be ... Profitable . Probably . You made me think ... you were my father ! Show me ... what you really look like . On our travel to the new world , we saw this ... your module ... being flown through an unstable wormhole . Piloted by this creature . Who the hell is that ? " Are you saying this is a duplication ? Scorpius didn 't copy your module . So , who did it ? What do you think ? Furlow . Got a nice detailed scan last time you were here . - Put ' em on . Flares coming . - How do you know ? I can sense them . Talyn is blinded and so am I ! Here they come ! If it isn 't my favorite flyboy ? Just couldn 't stay away from me , huh ? You fear me ! No , you just smell . He did tell me that there 's a Scarran Dreadnought heading for this planet . It 'll arrive within 6 arns . How much data did they get ? Enough to make their own phase stabilizer . But I guarantee ... the Dreadnought 'll still get here . Charrid cowards couldn 't hit a pregnant Lobboth ! I knew about the stuff you guys put in my head . How ? A guy named Scorpius , he discovered the info was there ... and he put a neural chip in my head to extract the information . I will fight you , and I will win . Officer Sun ... what luscious lips . Amongst ... other things . Crichton was ... a very lucky man . - Where is he ? - Gone . Gambled and lost . And now ... on Farscape . How unfortunate you must lose as well . And Zhaan ... gave herself for you . What a waste , wouldn 't you say ? Well , that 's hardly sporting is it ? I should have a weapon as well . Then we can settle this ... one on one . Don 't . It 's not ... easy , is it ? Putting a pulse blast in John Crichton . - You 're not John . - Not up here , no . But the rest of his body 's intact . Be a shame to spoil it with that . I 'm much more reasonable than John is . He didn 't want to share his mind with me . But I 'm more than willing to share ... his body with you . - Stand clear ! - No , don 't ! - It isn 't John ! - It is John ! - Look ! - Thank you ... daddy . Look at him . The clone 's dying ... he wants you to shoot him ... so John dies too . What ? ! Officer Sun ... next time ... be more decisive ... shoot ... quicker . A soldier ... must not be weak ... . Weakness means defeat Hey ... baby . He 's gone ... he 's finally gone . It 's just me . Can anyone hear me ? ! Aeryn ? Crichton ... ? Rygel ? Forget the comms ! Run a check on all airlocks and docking bays ! - What for ? - Damage , malfunction ... anything ! Why ? Because ... I know this ship , and , and , something 's ... out of balance . You 're imagining things ... - although this is strange . - what ? Docking bay two recently performed an atmosphere replenish as if it 'd been opened . But we landed the pod in docking bay one . Talyn ! Seal all hatches ! My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut ... shot through a wormhole ... . In some distant part of the universe ... . I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship ... this living ship ... of escaped prisoners ... my friends . If you can hear me ... beware ... if I make it back ... will they follow ? If I open the door ... are you ready ? Earth is unprepared , helpless ... for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay , protect my home , not show them you exist . But then you 'll never know ... the wonders I 've seen . I 've had Scorpy in my head for so long ... that ... I 've gotten used to it , and , and ... not having him ... ? It 's like being in pain , your whole life , and suddenly it 's gone . Jack ? I managed to find some ... e-transmitter coils . They 'll need a ... bit of work . This is it ? You can 't find anything better ? I had to search half the complex just to find that . Then search the other half , Furlow . John ? It 's time to go to work ... .. if you 're feeling strong enough . I 'm good . But , ah ... you better unlock that wormhole information inside my head . I just did . You did ? Really . I doesn 't happen instantaneously . You 're mind couldn 't process all those equations at once . Give it a little time . - That 's not good . - Man , that one was closer . Help ... Who are you ? ! Merely ... commerce traders , seeking repairs for our ship . This is some sort of Peacekeeper ship . Tell no lies ! Are you a Peacekeeper ? What is your rank ? I ... I am ... I am not a Peacekeeper . I have no rank . How did you get this ship ? I will tell you ... - he stole it . - What ? Uh , uh , he was a captain , but now he 's a renegade . He stole this Leviathan mutant from the Peacekeepers , and now they want him dead ... they want all of us all dead ! Who are you ? I am a Banik slave ... his slave . And I hate him . He brought me on board this ship to help him fix it . Kill him ... and make me your slave ! Kill him ? Is this the truth ? ! Yes , yes ! Every word ! Make this ship operational ... and I 'll grant you and easy death . You sure this thing 's unlocked ? I 'm not feelin ' any smarter . Give it some time . All right , but somethin ' better kick in before that Dreadnought gets here . It will . This may require an ocillation damper . Here ya go ... use that . Perfect . Thanks . Why 'd you pick this one ? You said you wanted an ocillation damper . I figured you could modify the rillon valve . I can . But how did you know that ? That 's cool . - Oh ? ! What ... what happened ? - What happened to you ? Piece of shrapnel ... why are we still here ? Where the yotz is Talyn ? Don 't know . The comms are still out . Here , I 'll take over . No , no . You 're still mobile . I 'm not . Just ... bring me food . You want to eat ... now ? Bring me food ... and I 'll keep going . It 's starting to make sense . It 's all comin ' together . We still need an inversion loop and don 't have the parts to build it . Sure you do . Use this to set up the resonance ... and ... this to flip it Good . What an elegant solution . I couldn 't accomplish this without you . Jack , what the hell are we building ? A displacement engine . Yeah , and whatever it is will take out a Scarran Dreadnought . Yes . And then ? What do you mean ? I mean ... how far are you gonna take this ? Is this the end , or are you gonna try and put all the toothpaste back in the tube ? I doubt that 's possible . But you 're gonna give it the old college try , aren 't you ? You 're gonna kill ... me , Furlow , and Aeryn . Aeryn poses no threat . Furlow ... I 'm uncertain . And what about me ? I no longer doubt your intentions , John . Coils are almost ready . What 's the tolerance ? - Lurg 3 , close as I can get ' em . - Should be close enough . Rygel 's keeping the Charrids at bay , but barely . Where do we stand ? - We 're almost done . - I need a quarter arn . I have to install the partanium and build the emitter array . I want you to stay clear of this hanger until I give the okay . I don 't want you exposed to this radiation . Well , I can check the area outside the hangar doors again . - You want some company ? - Sure . I still can 't raise Talyn . And the Dreadnought is due in what , two more arns ? - We may not even have that much time . - You think they 're in trouble ? Well , Scarrans will send an advance scout unit before committing the main force . Like what , a prowler detail ? Anything from a one man stealth capsule to a full fighter squad . But , with Talyn blinded , they may be upon him before he can Starburst away . Well , hell . We didn 't have enough to worry about . Furlow . Here ya go . This all you need ? This case could be stronger . Don 't worry , I haven 't initiated the partanium reaction yet . when you do , just in case something goes wrong ... where is the emergency shut-down control ? There isn 't one . Once the device is activated , you can 't shut it down . Then what does it do , blow up ? You building ' a bomb here , Jack ? Not at all . After 1.4 arns , a meltdown occurs and destroys the device . So , you only got one shot at ... whatever it is this thing does . That 's all I should need . I 'm launching soon . You 're flyin ' the module ? Does Johnny know about this ? No , and I don 't want to have an arguement with him about it . As soon as he and Aeryn give the all clear from outside , I want you to open those hangar doors . Now , go on . Well , go on . I 'm about to start the reactor . I can 't let you do that , Jack . Back off . This is the only chance we have to keep the Scarrans from ... From ... paying ' me a lot of money . Now ... you ain 't goin ' ... no where . You had to kill him ? He would have made a useful prize ! You think he 'd'a cooperated ? Forget it . This ... my friend , is the prize . What is it ? Ah , well , it 's a um ... I don 't exactly know what it is . But I do know that our friend here seemed to think that it could kill a Dreadnought . It hardly seems finished ! No , sure it is . Just a little here , there , you know . Ah , anyway , you know , I really think we oughta ... scoot , while we got the chance . Agreed ! Excuse me , ah ... where ya goin ? 'Cause ah , see ... I-I 'm the one who 's flyin ' the module here ... not , not you . Incorrect . No , come on , you know . I need you guys to cover me when I retreat , and ... No . See , we don 't trust you any longer . What ? ! 'Cause you 've ... allowed to many of us to die ! I had to do that , you know , don 't you get it ? If they knew I was on your side , then ... We 're not sure ... who 's side you 're on ! I ... will fly the module , alone ! You ... reattach that to the module . Jack . Charrids ... they snuck in . I nailed ' em , but ... they got Jack . No , oh , no , no , no . It 's okay . It 's okay ... Jack . I 'll finish it . We 'll keep your ancients safe and sound . What happened , how did they get in ? You tell me . I thought you and the short one were supposed to be guarding ' the place Well , what about your supposed booby-traps ? - What about them ? - I think you should check them . Fine . I will . John , we have ... two arns at most before the Dreadnought gets here . Can you operate this device ? It 's not finished . Can you finish it ? I 'm not even sure what it does . Well , you have to ... I ... I , I thought that the knowledge was ... starting to open up in you . Maybe I 'll pick it up as I go along . Talyn 's senses are beginning to recover once they do , he can target the Scarran and shoot him . It would take heavy and prolonged fire to bring down the Scarran . He won 't just stand ... Work ! Work ! I can find no Pilot on board this Leviathan . There isn 't one . It doesn 't need it . There is a direct interface ... Stark ! Let him speak . Shut up ! The best way to operate this ship is via neural transponder . Look ... Here 's the socket . You see ... his transponder was damaged , so he had to remove it . But the ship ... can construct a replacement . You will have the ship make one for me ! Yes , yes . Whatever you say . I had to tell him . He would have forced it out of you anyway . You did well . Instruct Talyn to prepare a neural transponder ... - two in fact . - Two ? One for me ... and one for the Scarran . It 's ... gonna work . It 's all comin ' together . I got it . Aeryn ... I got it . It all fits , everything fits . I-I-I know how to do this . I can build this thing , I know what it does ! Can it destroy the Dreadnought ? it could destroy a planet . Jack . All right , he 's uh , built it so it self-destructs after one use . That 's ... that 's good , that 's ... smart . Big hole in the sewage outlet . Think I might 'a found where the Charrids got in . Did you seal it ? With what ? - I 'll seal it . - " I 'll seal it . " Feeble Sebacean . You believe that even with vessels like this you can defeat ... Scarrans ? Slave ... the neural transponder ? Soon . Nearly finished . Soon . It will give me absolute control of the ship ? Yes , yes . You will think as one ! Assist your ... captain . Yes , yes , yes . How many other people have this weapon ? No one . - That 's right . Gettin ' the idea ? - Elucitin capacitor . See , ah ... we can sell it to everyone as deterrence , give it to no one , and charge ' em to maintain the balance . Or ... of course , we could just keep it ourselves and find a ... peaceful application . Furlow ... is it always about the money ? Is there anything else ? I mean ... how much sex can you have ? I don 't know ... I haven 't maxed out yet . The Scarrans have your data . That 's a blueprint that has to be destroyed . Okay , so ... we use this box to stop ' em . But later ... we talk business . You help me , and I 'll make you Miss 21st Century Wormhole . Outstanding . Now ... what do you need ? Clear a launch path . Get rid of that crap . Comin ' right up . Tight fit through the exit portals , shield doors don 't open all the way . You better go eyeball the angle or you 'll sheer off a wingtip for sure . All right . So ... partners ? Partners . There 's still plenty of them out there . Enough ... of them to squeeze us into a crossfire . Why haven 't they ? Furlow Come on in , John . 'round the front so I don 't have to twist my neck . This is a big mistake . You wanna save your life , you 're gonna have to cooperate . I know it looks great on ya , but ah ... two fingers , pistol . And , uh , goggles . Drop ' em . Now step on ' em . There 's a Scarran Dreadnought on the way . Where you gonna go , Furlow ? To meet ' em . To save my life . You know , when the Scarrans get this baby ... they 'll go away . Don 't do this . Wormhole fulla reasons why I should . And no upside in crossing ' the Scarrans . I gotta go while I got cover . Don 't stand in my way , John . Crap ! Why have they stopped shelling ? What are we missing ? What ? What 's that ? It 's John . - Frell ! - Cover us . Furlow 's with the Scarrans . That would explain why the Charrids have stayed on the perimeter . Explains a lot of things . - You know , we are running out of time . - We still got time . You know this new knowledge you 've got in your head ? Yeah ? Can you use it to get home ? Yeah Let 's do what we have to do here , and then we 'll go . - What the ... ! - Frell ! You 'll never guess ! It doesn 't work ? ! How the hell can we have ... the only gun on the planet that doesn 't work ? ! It 's your fault . My fault ? ! Well , you know if I was here on my own , it 'd be working right now . Well , I hope you got a plan , baby , 'cause I 'm fresh out of ideas . - Drive straight . - Straight ? It 's a plan . He has to follow our tracks . All right , you get Furlow . I 've got your back . I love you . Love you ! Run away . Be smart . Run away . Should 've run . You know , you should 'a git while you had the chance . You should 'a done the right thing . How well you know me ? You think I like the Scarrans ? They sent in the Charrids , slaughtered my crew , tortured me . You think I faked all my wounds ? Turn around and walk away . Rather be dead , John . Too old to start over . Got nothin ' left . Won 't leave without that Furlow , I don 't have time for this . Damn ! Ready . Where is the neural transponder ? Why do I not yet have control of this vessel ? Because , because , because , I 'm still ... . ah , these controls ... see for youself ... Are you subverting my commands ? No , truely ! Scarran , I subvert your commands . You deny me the transponder ? Do you ... still want it ? Without delay ! Then ... you shall have it . Talyn , fire Crais ! Get down ! Thank you . It may not happen again . Furlow , look . The device ... it 's active . You can 't shut it off . By the time you get it to the Scarrans it 'll be useless . It 'll be slag . Frell ! I can 't deactivate it , but you gotta let me use it to take out the Dreadnought . Casings open , John . I can close it . Uh-huh . It 's too late already . The reaction 's building to fast . I think we both better get outta here . No , you go . Don 't be the hero , John . Always be the one to walk away while the hero dies . That 's my motto . One ... two ... three . You okay ? Yeah . I 'm fine . We have to hurry . Crichton ... Aeryn ... Rygel ... What is your status ? Frelled ... mivonks-on-a-plate frelled ! - What 's your status ? - I am partially sighted . Talyn has recovered sufficiently to attempt Starburst . Well , pick me up and let 's go Crichton , Aeryn Crais , ... we got one shot at this . The ah , displacement engine will take out the Scarrans . You need to pick up Sparky and get the hell outta here . Yes , Starburst immediately . It is unanimous . We stay . Ah , damn it , Crais , knock it off . You 're gonna make me start liking you . Is there anything we can do ? It would be helpful to have the Dreadnought , ah , directly in line with the mouth of the wormhole . What wormhole ? The one I 'm about to rustle up . We will attempt to lure them . Good fortune . - John ? Are you hurt ? - No . No , I 'm fine . What happened ? What did she do to you ? - No , she didn 't do anything . - What 's the matter ? She didn 't ... What ... is the matter ? Radiation . Massive radiation . I couldn 't help it . I couldn 't stop it . That has to be something you can do . No , I have to finish this . You 're finished here , I 'm flying the mission . Aeryn you don 't know what to do . You will talk me through it . You will get help , and you will not argue with me on this one . Damn it ! This is not something I can coach you through ! It 's half intuition , it 's half feeling . I know it like I invented it . So it 's your life for everyone elses ? And you 're different how ? I 'm different because I love you . Then you know I have to do this . I 'm coming back . Scarran Dreadnought ... this is Captain Bialar Crais ... Peacekeeper . Approach any closer ... you will be engaged and destroyed . They must be terrified . Crais , where is it ? I can 't see that damn Dreadnought anywhere . Closing fast on an intercept vector with Talyn . But , Crichton , there is no wormhole to maneuver them . Oh , there 's my flare . Mama Crichton 's baby boy ... makin ' wormholes . Close ... Close ... Very close . This is ... ? We 're being targeted . What was that ? ! I destroyed Furlow 's lab . There 's nothing left . Okay , displacement engine , time to displace . Scarran Dreadnought ... withhold your fire , we surrender . I repeat , we surrender . Talyn , stand down your weaponry . Make them believe . Draw them in . John ? I 'm almost there . The wormhole is touching the star . It 's touching the star . Okay , Jack . This one 's for you . I have no prayer for that . John ? Are you ... ? Yeah , Baby , I 'm ... I 'm still here . Told you I 'd come back . The ... radiation sickness treatments from ... Talyn 's emergency kits should ... relax . It was a big hit ... nothin ' to be done . And I hate ... long goodbyes Your sacrifice ... does not go unnoted , Commander . Crais . You ... find the better part of yourself ... you ... have to take care of them . I will . I ... hope you can believe that . Good bye , Crichton . Hey , hey , hey ... Sparky . They say ... it 's not good . Sparky , come here . My stuff ... You can 't have it . It will be hard ... not to think of you . I 'm gonna miss you , Dominar . Stark ! It 's okay . I 'm very angry . Me too . We had good times . I wouldn 't change it for the world . You made me ... a better person . That wasn 't hard . I love you . so much . I love you . I would have gone to Earth . I 'm ... sorry you never got to meet my dad ... my real dad . I 'm ... sorry I never met your dad . I 'm ... sorry about a lot of things . Don 't be , I don 't want you to go that way . I won 't . What ? They say ... it 's a lucky or an unambitious man who goes when he 's ready . That said ... Scorpius is gone ... I 'm at peace . I don 't ... hurt . I ... I did some good things . I 'm proud of my life . And I 'm with you . Don 't worry about me ... I 've never felt better . SUBTITLES By Slay and Pcosmos

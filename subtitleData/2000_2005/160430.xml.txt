 Unit Four , I got a fire out on the highway at the 20-mile mark . Unit Four , confirmation of downed aircraft burning . All units , we 've got a 10-13 . Unit Four , this is Detective Miles . I 'm coming right at you , Ray . Now , you wait for backup before you head out , all right ? Unit Four , come back , Deputy . Deputy Hoese . - Ray ? Oh , my God . Lariat car rentals totals ... Would you like to see the figure ? - Is that a lot ? - A lot ? Gas , expenses , the motel rooms alone ... By F.B.I. standards , these numbers are out of control . We could start sharing rooms . You 're under evaluation . There has to be a point when we say no . You can 't really compare what we do to other departments in the bureau . - Right . This business with aliens . - There 's more to it than that . But at the end of the day , you 'd say aliens are your real focus ? That 's the reason I got started , yeah . Investigating your sister 's abduction ... and the government conspiracy around it . Both of which have been resolved , correct ? Nothing has been resolved , exactly . In this case report here , it 's concluded your sister is dead , as well as the men who took her . This is your handwriting here on the report , Agent Mulder ? Yeah . So , what exactly is left to investigate ? Your release has been arranged . Marita Covarrubias . Last time I saw you , I left you for dead . Alex , if it was strictly up to me , I 'd leave you here to rot too . I see the money bleed out , but it just doesn 't seem to make the results of your work any better . So many of the cases you investigate are left unexplained . Makes it hard to justify the expense . So much of the work that we do cannot be measured in standard terms . - How would you measure it ? - We open doors ... with the X-Files which lead to other doors . Doors leading to ... a conspiracy of men who cooperated with alien beings ... " to create human / alien hybrids ... so we could all become slaves of an alien invasion . " I believe that there was once a conspiracy . I believe I was taken by men ... who subjected me to medical tests ... which gave me cancer and left me barren . But you don 't believe in aliens ? I 've seen things that I cannot deny . Who sent you ? - The Smoking Man . He 's dying . You said you were finished . I turned in my report and was asked to go over a few things . As you know , the times we live in , the world is changing fast . I 'm missing your point . As I said , this is an evaluation , Agent Mulder , to understand what you do , so if you go forward , you can do so more responsibly . That sounds more like a threat . Cost benefit analysis . But if you want the truth , I really don 't care one way or the other . You mostly record bizarre facts on bizarre cases . In other words , information gathering . Something , it seems to me , you can easily do on the Internet . I can 't do my job from an office . I promise you . Nowadays , the most advanced space exploration ... is done sitting in an office , Agent Mulder . Why ? It 's just too damn expensive putting men in outer space . - I 'm not looking in outer space . - Bringing us to the point . If you spend so much time and money looking for aliens , responsibly you should narrow your search . - To where ? - Wherever they are . It 's not unreasonable . It 's just a matter of reducing your vision . Hey , you all right ? What 's the problem ? - Isn 't that your car , Mr. Miles ? - Yeah . A small accident . Everything 's all right . What are you boys doing out here ? Well , we heard there was a plane crash . Military jet fighter collided midair with a U.F.O. Navy found their plane about three miles away . We 've seen no evidence of any other crash . But we heard a sheriff say he saw a fire burning ... off the highway at the 20-mile mark . There 's nothing out here . No fire . No sign of fire . Now , you boys go on home . There 's nothing to see here . I think I 'm in big trouble . How many times have they tried to shut us down ? Yeah , but I never actually assaulted an auditor before . - Did you hurt him ? - I reduced his vision a little bit . - Mulder . - Agent Fox Mulder ? - Speaking . My name is Billy Miles . I don 't know if you remember me . Yeah , Oregon , seven years ago . You had multiple abduction experiences . I 'm here with Agent Scully . - Billy , are you all right ? - Yeah . This may seem weird , me calling like this , but , uh , I don 't know where else to turn . - Is it happening again , Billy ? Yeah , but not to me this time . More alien abductions , Scully . Mmm . I don 't know how we could possibly justify the expense . We 'd probably turn up nothing . Let 's go waste some money . Hi . He 's anxious to see you . - I was worried about you , Alex . - Cut the crap , old man . I heard about your incarceration . You had me thrown in that hellhole . For trying to sell something that was mine , was it not ? I hope we can all move forward , put the past behind us . We have a singular opportunity now . - " Singular opportunity " ? - There 's been a crash in Oregon . An alien ship has collided with a military aircraft . Recovery is all important . It 's Roswell and Corona all over again ... 50 years later . It 's our chance to rebuild the project . How do you know someone hasn 't already recovered it ? It 's never quite so easy . - I 'm getting something here , Gary . - I told you , Richie . Hey , man , look at this . Gary ! Gary ? Come on , man . My dad got them to fudge the psych qualifications . - You 're married , Billy . - Uh , divorced . I live back with my dad now . You 've never , um ... Have you ever been able to get over the abductions ? Well , I have , but people haven 't . No one really believes it . My dad still denies it ever happened ... that any one of us was taken . Does he deny that it 's happening now ? There was a crash . A navy pilot hit an unidentified aircraft outside of town . Now , the military found their jet , but the other craft hasn 't been recovered . - Why not ? - Well , it 's our county , and we 're in charge of coordinating efforts . But my dad has really been no help , even though we have a deputy missing . You find the U.F.O. , and he won 't be able to deny the truth . I hope that 's all it is . What 's going on , Bill ? Just talking to some people you might remember , Dad , from the F.B.I. - Agent Scully , Agent Mulder . - Oh . What brings you folks out here ? You 're not thinking this incident 's some kind of U.F.O. ? The crash of an unidentified craft . Well , I 've been on with the F.A.A. You might want to follow up . Looks an awful lot like there was no crash at all . Deja vu all over again . That was there already , in case you 're wondering at all about it . I watched Agent Mulder paint that there seven years ago . - What for ? - To mark an anomalous electrical disturbance , the kind where time gets bent or goes missing ... or where your car loses power and dies in the middle of the road . These skid marks are mine . That was the deputy 's car up there sitting there without his lights on ? If they 'd been on , I would have seen him . Good point . Detective ? Did the , uh , deputy carry a.38 ? .38 super . Why ? Three shells were discharged . I imagine they could 've rolled from up there . - What was he shooting at ? - Probably nothing . - Nothing ? - Nothing 's all you seem to find out here . Was the missing deputy a good cop ? Yeah , sure , I guess . Married ? Single ? Bill ! - Come on over here with those . - He was married . New baby . You know , they only want to solve this . Get in the car , Bill . - Yes ? - Sorry to bother you , Mrs. Hoese . - We 're with the F.B.I. - Is this about my husband ? Are ... You 're Teresa ? Teresa Nemman ? Yes . Seven years ago you came to Agent Scully and I for help . - You were afraid of being abducted . - Oh , my God . - Uh ... Please come in . I 'm sorry . I sort of lost it when I realized who you were . We , uh , came to see if there 's anything that you can tell us ... that might help us find your husband . We had no idea you were his wife . I don 't know if it 's important . Maybe I just hope it 's not , but ... Ray and I have a connection ... that 's even deeper for us . He 's an abductee too ? He kept it a secret from almost everyone . It doesn 't make you real popular around here . His experiences were a lot more terrifying than mine . He was taken many times and tested . I have extensive medical records on him ... and photos of his scars . - I 'll get you the files . Can you hold him ? It 's okay . Thank you . What do you see ? What do you see ? What 's that ? - Once upon a time there was a little baby - Who is it ? It 's me . - What 's wrong , Scully ? You look sick . - I don 't know what 's wrong . Come in . I , um ... I was starting to get ready for bed , and I started to feel really dizzy . Vertigo or something . And then I just ... I started to get chills . You want me to call a doctor ? No , I just ... I just want to get warm . Oh , good . Thank you . It 's not worth it , Scully . What ? - I want you to go home . - Mulder , I 'm gonna be fine . No , no , I 've been thinking about it . Looking at you today holding that baby and ... knowing everything 's that been taken away from you ... a chance for motherhood and your health ... and that made me ... think that ... maybe they 're right . Who 's right ? The F.B.I. Maybe what they say is true , but for all the wrong reasons . It 's the personal costs that are too high . There 's so much more you need to do with your life . There 's so much more than this . There has to be an end , Scully . In spite of a great deal of effort , no one seems to be able to find this U.F.O. of yours . Of course they can 't . You know why ? 'Cause it 's not here . It 's there , Alex . I 'm certain of it . Hidden in plain sight . You listen to me . If you 're gonna play games , Mulder and Scully , they 're gonna beat me to it . Are you saying that Mulder and Scully are there looking for the U.F.O. ? They 're looking for a missing deputy . Well , they 're looking for the right thing , but in the wrong place . You sent me looking for a ship . Find the deputy , find the ship . Who is it ? Ray ? Oh , my God . Oh , my God . I was so worried . I-I was so sure ... What did they do to you this time ? Ray , talk to me . You 're not my husband . No ! No ! What happened , Billy ? Teresa 's gone . She 's been taken . They took her . How do you know ? The door was open . Scully . The floor . What do you see ? The same thing as out on the road . We 've seen it before . Yeah . I have . We both have . What is it ? It 's a biological toxin ... emitted as a gas through the bloodstream . - From who ? - From what is arguably ... an alien . Oh . - You okay ? - Yeah . You sure ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Thanks . Thank you , Greta . Why the trouble to bring Krycek here and then toy with him ? Do you trust Alex , Marita ? - Then why bring him here at all ? - You misunderstand . I 've great faith that Alex will find the ship . But if I told him how , he 'd be tempted to sell the information . - And you 're certain it 's there ? - Oh , yes . But it won 't be there forever . It 's rebuilding itself . If he finds the ship , then what ? To possess it ... is to possess the answer to all things . Every possible imaginable question . To God ? There 's no God , Marita . What we call God is only alien ... an intelligence much greater than us . They 're coming here , aren 't they ? They 're only coming back . Mulder ? Hey ! - Hey , what are you doing ? - I was just standing there . Is that against the law ? - You know this guy ? - Yeah . - What are you doing , Richie ? - They took him . They took Gary . He-He was just gone . - Relax . Slow down . - They 're out there ! - I don 't care what your dad says , Billy . - My dad ? He was out there too . He knows . I was shining my flashlight in the dark , looking for the U.F.O. , and , uh , the beam hit this spot in space , like it bent the light . - And then what happened ? - Well , I yelled , " Gary ! " - And then what happened ? - Well , I yelled , " Gary ! " And I looked , but he wasn 't there . He wasn 't anywhere , man . And then the flashlight got really hot , and I dropped it . Uh , it was right around here somewhere . Oh , hey , here it is . Scully ? Scully ? - Scully . - You want some water ? - What happened to her ? - Can you just get her some water ? I just ... I just ... I just hit the ground . Here , lie still . Why is this happening to me ? It 's okay . It 's okay . - What the hell 's going on , Mulder ? - I don 't know . But these aren 't just random abductions , Scully . - We 've gotta warn Billy Miles of that . - Of ... Of what ? These abductees aren 't just systematically being taken . They 're not coming back . Dad ? Billy ? - What are you doing ? - You stay where you are . - Billy , it 's me . - I said , stay where you are ! - Damn it , Billy , listen to me . - No . I don 't know who you are , but you are not gonna take me . I 'm your father . Are you gonna shoot your father ? If you 're my father , then why won 't you believe me ? I believe you , Billy . I ... I just want it all to go away . Give me the gun , son . Billy ? Billy ! - Agent Mulder ? - What 's our punishment this time ? Thumb screws or 40 lashes ? Come on in , Walter . Sit a spell . This could be the last time you take a trip down to these offices . You went to Oregon . Guilty as charged . And if they 're coming down on you for that , I 'm sorry . I truly am . Fortunately , they think that I make a contribution to the bureau . Oh , well , yeah . Stick to a budget , and they say you 're making a contribution . But push the limits of your profession , and they say you 're out of control . You could bring home a flying saucer and have an alien shake hands with the president . What it comes down to , Agent Mulder , is ... they don 't like ya . Well , we didn 't bring home a flying saucer or an alien . Yeah . So I 've been told . Agent Mulder ! I think you should listen to him . You 've got every reason to wanna see me dead , but you gotta listen to me now . You 're the singular opportunity . - Here , or do you want to step outside ? - Agent Mulder . Cancer Man is dying . His last wish is to rebuild his project , to have us revive the conspiracy . It all begins in Oregon . The ship that collided with that navy plane ... it 's in those woods . - There 's no ship in those woods . - Yeah , it 's there , cloaked in an energy field while he mops up the evidence . - Who ? - The alien bounty hunter . Billy Miles , Teresa Hoese , her husband . He 's eliminating proof of all the tests . See , we 're asking ourselves ... We 're asking ourselves , " Where are they ? " They 're right there . They 're right under our noses . But I 'm giving you the chance to change that ... to hold the proof . Why me ? And why now ? I wanna damn the soul of that cigarette-smoking son of a bitch . Mulder ? What 's amazing is that even the military satellites don 't see this . ButJ.P.L. ' s TOPEX / Poseidon shows it only as waveform data . And here it appears simply as a microburst of transmission error ... on the European Space Agency 's ERS-2 . - In other words ? - In other words , you 'd never know it 's a U.F.O. If you didn 't know what you were looking at or looking for . - No wonder we couldn 't see them . - It is not gonna be there forever . As we all stand here talking , it 's rebuilding itself . Mulder , if any of this is true ... If it is or if it isn 't , I want you to forget about it . - Forget about it ? - You 're not going back out there . - I 'm not gonna let you go back out there . - What are you talking about ? It has to end sometime . That time is now . - Mulder ... - You have to understand . They 're taking abductees . You 're an abductee . I 'm not gonna risk ... losing you . I won 't let you go alone . This is starting to feel like the snipe hunt I was afraid of . There 's no such thing as a snipe , sir . My ass is on the line here too , Agent Mulder . I know that . This just can 't be . What are you looking at ? Medical records . Billy Miles ... and other known abductees in Bellefleur , Oregon . - They all experience anomalous brain activity . - Electroencephalitic trauma . Which is exactly what Mulder experienced earlier this year . - I don 't understand . - There was something out there in that field . It knocked me back because it didn 't want me . Mulder thinks that it 's me that 's in danger of being taken . When it 's Mulder who 's in danger . Scully ? - Scully ! - Are you okay ? How 's it supposed to work ? Not exactly sure , sir . - But , um , budgetarily , I 'd say we 're looking pretty good . Agent Mulder . ! Mulder ! Mulder ! Mulder . We failed . Perhaps you never meant to succeed . Anyway , the hour is at hand , I presume . What are you doing ? Sending the devil back to hell . As you do to Mulder and to me , you do to all of mankind , Alex . Agent Scully . - Hi . - Hi . How are you feeling ? I 'm feeling fine . They 're just running some tests on me . Uh ... I already heard . I lost him . I don 't know what else I can say . I lost him . I 'll be asked ... what I saw . And what I saw I can 't deny . I won 't . We will find him . I have to . Sir , um , there 's something else I need to tell you . Something that I need for you to keep to yourself . I 'm having a hard time ... explaining it ... or believing it , but , um , I 'm pregnant .

 Futurama [ 3x05 ] - Amazon Women In The Mood - CiWaN People , we got a problem . Nibbler 's been coughing up hairballs . So has Fry . What 's the big deal ? He 's got me beat . We all love Nibbler , so it 's only fair that we all clean up together . Still , I propose we make Zoidberg do it . All in favor ? Yeah , okay . All opposed ? All abstaining ? Dr. Zoidberg , are you okay ? He 's dead . Oh , no ! He always seemed so full of life . Laughing , singing , begging for scraps . And now this ! Why with all the crying ? So , that 's where I left my shell . I didn 't know it came off . It was getting a little cramped , so I molted , why not ? The fresh air feels good . Stop doing that ! So long . I 'm off to toss this old shell in the dumpster ... And maybe pick up the potato chips Amy didn 't finish . Those were toenail clippings . A feast is a feast . Hey , that 's my cell phone ! Hello ? Hello ? Who is this ? Hello ? Did you swallow your phone again ? Some guy 's been calling and hanging up 10 times a day for a year . Men who call too much are the worst , I bet . I wish a decent guy would call me . Not this spleeze-Ball who has me too terrified to answer the phone . Hello ? Hello ? Is anyone there ? I love you ! Why must I be such a coward ? I 'm off to the men 's room , and I need an attendant- - Oh , I 'm sorry . You 're crying like a woman . I see myself as a father figure to some of my more pathetic men . Kif , old friend , let 's rap . Well , I 'm in love with this girl . Oh , that 's rich ! Go on . I met her a year ago ... Escaping from that cruise ship you piloted into a black hole .

Kif 's the sweetest guy who ever liked me . Five , and that 's my final offer . Four ! One . Two . Half . I 'll take it . We 'll meet you for part of dinner and half of a movie . Sir ? I don 't go out on many dates . What if I don 't know what to say ? Here 's my book of pickup lines . Say as many as you can , as fast as you can . Don 't stop . I 'll just give her these flowers . Wrong , wrong , wrong . And what 's that ? Candy ? Candy 's for dorks . Give me that . Mm . Hello , beautiful . I got these for you . Thanks . Well , well . This looks to be one disturbingly erotic date . Half-Date . A bottle of wine . Half-Bottle . And oysters on the half-Shell . Quarter-Shell . And I 'd like- - He 's not hungry . It 's expensive . I 'd like two steaks , and the ladies will have sensual salads ... With low-Cal sensual dressing . Oh , Won 't you take me to funky town ... Thank you . Kif , you haven 't said a word all night . Well , um , eh ... . Hello . Because I was really hoping we could talk and stuff . " If I said you had a beautiful body ... Would you take your pants off and dance ? " What ? Lieutenant Kroker ! " I find the most erotic part of a woman is the boobies . " Kif ! Oh , my . This half-Date is entirely over . Amy ? Conference . Is there nothing we can do ? There 's one way into a woman 's heart and parts beyond . I speak , of course , of karaoke . My years in the Duke Boys' Chorus will not have been in vain . All right , enough lipstick . Let 's storm out . Once upon a time I was falling in love ... But now I 'm only falling apart ... Oh , that 's so emotional ! There 's nothing I can do a total eclipse of the heart ... Amateur hour 's over . Let me show you why they call me " The Velour Fog . " Hit it . I met her in a club down in old Soho ... We would drink champagne It 'd taste just like Coca-Cola ... C-O-L-A Cola ... Give us a break . He sickens me ! She walked up to me and she asked me to dance ... I asked her her name and in a dark-brown voice she said ... Leela L-E-E-L-A Leela Lee-Lee-Lee-Lee-Leela Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Bum-Bum Dee-Dee-Dee , dee-Dee-Dee Leela ! Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Bum-Bum We 're going home . Call us a space taxi . No need . There 's not a restaurant built I can 't fly . Where to , ladies ? Please , sir . Let 's just divide up the check , and- - Let 's see what this eatery can do .

Me hear people , but me not see . Everybody make mistake . Well , hello . I usually don 't say this ... But you are the most beautiful trio of gigantic ladies I 've ever seen . I find the most erotic part of a woman is the boo- - Oh , no . Any sign of Leela or Amy ? No , but what do you make of this ? I don 't know , but it might have something to do with this . Oh , your God ! Move . Go . All right . Here 's the plan . What kind of moronic plan is that ? Wow . Women go free . Men stay in chains . We take them to our leader . She know what do . A female leader ? Fry , shut up ! Yes , captain . This capital city , planet Amazonia . Where are all the men ? Men die out many year ago . They were probably nagged to death . Are you with me , fellas ? Here stadium , where women basketball teams play . No can dunk , but good fundamentals . That more fun to watch . Oh , God , you 're killing me . God , you 're killing me ! This our comedy club . Humor different here . It not reinforce stereotypes . Comedy come from character , not abstract craziness . Translation : boring . That 's a good one . Ow ! This planet sounds better and better . I 'm already looking for apartments . Here live all-Knowing leader . She decide men 's fates . Is she hot ? Not important . She all-Knowing . In other words , no . Oh ! All hail Fem-Puter . All hail Fem-Puter ! You obey a big computer ? Yes . It appeared at time men die out . Why did you make it your leader ? It different kind of politician . Not beltway insider . Fem-Puter , we bring offering of bath beads and scented soaps . Your gift pleases Fem-Puter . Why are there men on her planet ? ! It was an accident . That does not fem-Pute . Fem-Puter will return after deciding your punishment ! I 'm through making fun of women . I want them to help me . Should we do something ? There 's no hurry . Yes . A little tighter . Tighter . Perhaps a hard spanking is in order ? Too hard ! Men strange . You have them ? I 'm afraid so . What they for ? Oh . You mean snu-Snu ! We hear tell men used for snu-Snu . All we have go on are ancient legend and subscription to Cosmo . fyi , I could be used for snu-Snu . Silence ! You want die like last men visit Amazonia ? What did they die of ? Crushed pelvises . Yes ! Thank you , Lord in heaven ! After lengthy fem-Putations , I have decided the fate of the men . Fem-Puter sentences them to death ... By snu-Snu ! Yeah ! What are you , gay ? Death to the men ! Death by snu-Snu ! But the snu-Snu part will be good . Baby , it 'll blow your mind . Be reasonable . Sure , men are annoying , and they wreck their planets . But these men are sort of my friends . They don 't deserve to die . Hm . Perhaps men are not as evil as Fem-Puter thinks . They make fun women 's basketball . What ? ! Did you explain how good fundamentals make up ... For their inability to dunk ? Yes . They still laugh . The men must die ! Too true , Fem-Puter . You 're so wise . Kill ' em all . Good riddance . Did I mention I 'm not a man ? I 'm a manbot . Understandable mistake . You can let me down . He big jerk like man . Sure , but check the crotch . Nothing . Very well . Release him . As for the others , take them to the snu-Snu chambers . I 'll miss you , meat bag . Me too , meat bag . I never thought I 'd die like this , but I 'd always really hoped . The Amazonians will be divided into three groups . The one called Zapp will be snu-Snu 'd by the large women . He that is designated Fry Will be snu-Snu 'd by the petite Women . And Kif , as the most attractive male ... Will be snu-Snu 'd by the most beautiful Women of Amazonia . Then the large women . Then the petite women . Then the large women again . Initiate snu-Snu ! Before I die , I have to tell you I didn 't mean to say those awful things . They were all Zapp 's idea . Really ? Honest and true ? Yes . And that person calling and hanging up was me . I was just too nervous to say hello because I love you ! Oh , Kif ! It Og 's first time . Be gentle ! We 've got to do something . You can interface with the fem-Puter and reprogram it . Maybe you can interface with my ass . By biting it ! All right , I 'll go . Whoo , yeah ! Oh , baby ! How Tonk look ? Tonk look good . Me fat . No , you look good . Tonk fat . Intruder ! Stay away from the mighty Fem-Puter ! Guards ! Time to override the CPU and reprogram this fem-Puter . Stop it . Stop it ! Cut that out . Cease hitting Fem-Puter . You 're no fem-Puter , you 're a fembot . It 's true . I disguised myself so I could rule the Amazonians . But why ? Why ? Why ? I came here from a faraway planet . A planet ruled by a chauvinistic man-Puter that was really a manbot . Have you any idea how it feels to be a fembot ... In a manbot 's man-Puter 's world ? What ? And now , meddling manbot , there 's the question of what to do with you . We need rest . The spirit is willing , but the flesh is spongy and bruised . It time snu-Snu ! Can 't we just cuddle ? No ! Oh . We can 't wait for Bender . It 's time for a woman 's touch . Hee-Ya ! Oh ! Ya ! Hee-Yoo ! Ya ! Ya ! Ow ! Me next snu-Snu ! Out me way ! Where go beautiful man ? Me want snu-Snu ! Kif , jump ! My hero . Me not get snu-Snu . Get him ! Mighty Fem-Puter ! Small girl steal green kissy-Man . We kill her now ? Come back later . Leave me alone . Yeah , get lost ! Whoo , I 'm a scary fem-Puter . Release the prisoners . And bring gold . Lots of gold . Why Fem-Puter want gold ? You heard the man . Come on , give me some of that . That 's how I got my new shell . It looks just like the one I threw out . I found it in the same dumpster , but this one had a live raccoon in it . Pretty good story , eh ? Stick to someone else , you windy barnacle ! The battle of the sexes was only resolved ... When a manbot and a fembot realized they loved each other . Yeah . By the way , if she calls , I 'm not here . All I know is , this gold says that was the best mission ever . It sure was . Oh , yeah . I had snu-Snu . So , Amy ? What do you want to do now ?

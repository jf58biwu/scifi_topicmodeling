 [ Man ] AJell-O salad with little pear chunks . It 's the Wednesday special at the hospital cafeteria . I can 't escape it . Listen to you . That didn 't stop you from eating my dessert . Well , all right . The profiteroles weren 't bad . - [ Beeping ] - You didn 't want me to starve , did you ? He ate mine too . Daddy , why don 't you take this before my arm falls off . Thanks , honey . [ Grunts ] Everybody ? - One last shot . - Oh , Dad . Do you think we can draw the line at 600 photographs ? Six hundred and one . Quit griping . And hold up that eyesore , Robert . God knows when you 're gonna win another one . Irv , you wanna think about staying the night ? - It 's awful late to head back to the city . - Yeah . What ? I get to stay at the home of the Bay Area Doctor of the Year ? It 's a deal . Proud of you , Robert . Up . Hold it up . Say " cheese . " " Presented to Dr. Robert Wieder M. D ... " for the great wisdom , skill and compassion ... he exhibits in the practice of medicine . " It 's gonna look awfully nice in your office . What are you thinking ? How this is just the cherry on top . How lucky I am . [ Beeping ] - What is it ? - Downstairs motion sensor . You think Dad tripped the alarm ? The alarm hasn 't been tripped . You got me . I 'll go check it out . Irv ? Irving , is everything all right ? What do you think , Scully ? Is this a name , possibly , or a code or an anagram ? T-H-E-E-F . I assume it 's supposed to be T-H-l-E-F . Thief . Insert your own Dan Quayle joke here . Lousy spelling aside , what do you think it refers to ? Who 's the thief ? [ Scully ] Well , that 's certainly one question . I 've got many . " Mulder , why are we here ? " Mmm , to be fair , I might have used the words , " Mulder , how is this an X-File ? " You see that , Scully ? You always keep me guessing . This is Dr. Irving Thalbro , age 66 , found hanged with his throat cut , his family tucked away and in bed not 40 feet from here . Didn 't see or hear anything . Which would certainly shine the light of suspicion on them . Except they 're the ones that called it in , and there 's no evidence whatsoever to link them to the crime . Which is why the police are rightly wondering ... if Dr. Thalbro killed himself . Except who , then , did this ? Blood pattern doesn 't indicate that the good doctor did it , who I am assuming could read and write above a fourth grade level . I 'll admit , Mulder , this is not an open-and-shut case . But , uh , it doesn 't make it an X-File . Well , there is one detail that does . This . Dirt ? Dirt . It 's a very powerful component of hexcraft , as well as the pattern in which it was originally arranged . Check this out . - Looks like a human form . - [ Sighs ] Hexcraft , as in putting a curse on someone ? Murdering them magically ? That 's what it looks like to me . Now , I know what you 're gonna say , Scully . No , hexcraft . I mean , I 'll buy that as the intent here . It certainly jives with the evidence . I say we talk to the family . I 'll always keep you guessing . It was probably the greatest night of my life . Till ... Sir , can you think of any enemies your father-in-law might have made ? Maybe inadvertently through his medical practice ... or a business dealing , perhaps ? Everybody loved Irving . Everyone who knew him . He was ... No , I can 't conceive of it . Dr. Wieder , do you have any enemies ? I 'm sorry I have to ask . There was a message left behind . If it doesn 't refer to your father-in-law , it may refer to you . [ Girl ] Thief ? Are you asking if my dad 's a thief ? He saves people 's lives . He 's a good man . Honey . If I have any enemies , I don 't know them . At the home of his son-in-law , Dr. Robert Wieder , Dr. Irving Thalbro was found hanged at 1 : 48 this morning . The details are sketchy . It 's my understanding ... that police are treating the case as a murder . This is due in part to core evidence left at the scene . [ TVContinues , Indistinct ] [ Sniffing ] Hello ? Mr. Peattie ? Mr. Peattie , I know you 're in there . Are you cooking ? You aren 't supposed to be cooking . You aren 't supposed to be cooking . That smell like somethin you wanna eat ? - Well , what is it , then ? - Medicine . Oh , all right . Uh , just so long as you 're not cooking . Seems like you could use yourself a poultice for your back . Old Peattie fix ya right up . Be ready later . [ Chanting , Indistinct ] - Scully . This dirt we found ? Gas pneumatograph shows ... - Mm-hmm . Pronounced spikes of methane and sulfur compounds . The signature of decay . It 's graveyard dirt , also known as conjure dust . It 's one of the most powerful hexing elements , whether for good or evil . Not the kind of stuff you want to be on the wrong end of . Uh-huh . Well , go ahead , Scully . Keep me guessing . Kuru . The-The , uh ... The disease that New Guinea tribesmen get ? From eating the brains of their relatives . I thought my grandpa slurping his soup was bad . Practically speaking , Mulder , Kuru doesn 't even exist anymore , not in New Guinea and certainly not in the U.S. But this man 's cerebellum and his triadim ... clearly show signs of it , Mulder . I mean , these plaques ... his brain is riddled with them . Kuru makes you crazy , right ? Yeah , stark-raving , among other things . But in this case , stark-raving mad enough to slit his own throat and hang himself . Mulder , that 's what his autopsy shows ... from the wound pattern to-to the blood spray . - This man did it to himself . There 's no question . - Unless ... it was inflicted upon him . The graveyard dirt , the hex . He was given this disease so that he would kill himself . Nan ? Honey ? Robert ? Look at this . It could be they needed it as evidence . [ Chattering Continues ] I 'm telling you , I 'm scared . I can 't stay here , Robert . I can 't live in this house anymore . Lucy can 't , not after what 's happened here . And now this picture of us is missing . - It 'll turn up . - No . It doesn 't make any sense . Nothing that 's happened here makes any sense . It does . Nan , listen to me . Your dad was ill . He had a kind of progressive dementia . That 's what the F.B.I. Autopsy showed . I reviewed their findings , and I have to agree . Honey , we will get through this . - Oh , my God ! Nan , honey ! - [ Groaning ] Oh , my God ! - Nan ! - Dad ? Lucy , call 911 . Call 911 ! Nan ! [ Chanting , Indistinct ] [ Beeping ] Dr. Wieder ? We understand you 've made a diagnosis . Diffuse Cutaneous Flesh Moniliasis . Old World type . - I take it that 's rare . - In San Francisco ? It 's unheard of . Maybe in Central Africa . - Well , the rarer , the better . - What do you mean by that ? Someone directed this to happen to your wife ... just as someone directed what happened to your father-in-law . My enemy you were talking about ... the one who thinks I 'm a thief ? Agent , you 're a doctor . Explain to your partner ... that no one can direct a person to get sick . The dirt you found in your bed drawn in the shape of a body , that 's indicative of folk magic . That 's what I believe is being used against you . Folk magic ? You mean , like , Babayaga ? Gypsies ? I was actually thinking less Eastern and more Celtic . Maybe Scots-Irish or Appalachian , even . I 'm supposed to take this seriously ? Sir , regardless of the particulars , I think it 's clear that there was an intruder in your home . And I think it would be prudent for you ... to accept our protection ... and help us to identify this person . Prudent for me would be to continue treating my wife . If we don 't stop who 's causing this , your treatments won 't matter . So modern medicine and all it encompasses ... artificial hearts , laser surgery , gene therapy , to name a few ... all of that arrayed against a pile of magic dirt ? And you tell me I 'll lose . I have M.R.I. S to look at . Oh , yeah , Mulder , win him over . He will lose unless we can find a way to stop it . What do you suggest ? A second opinion . [ Chuckling ] The truth always hurts , don 't it , Doc ? Who are you ? Is this you ? You did this ? What do you want from me ? Don 't you be frettin ' none about that . I 'm gettin my nickel 's worth . You 're doin a fine job so far . What the hell are you talking about ? What is this all about ? Lynette Peattie . And don 't you be sayin you don 't recollect her . Uh-uh . No , no , no . Look , if I 've done anything to upset you , I ... It 's no use trying to intimidate me if I don 't know how I 've offended you ! Tell me ! What makes me a thief ? You be a smart man . I figure ... you ponder it a while , it gonna come to ya . Wait ! [ Keyboard Clacking ] [ Sighs ] No . No matter how I spell it , there 's no Lynette Peattie . - She 's not in my patient file . - She 's not in any doctor 's patient file . No one by that name has ever been admitted to the hospital . You think you treated her ? What aboutJane Does ? You treated three in the last two years . Pull the files , please . You remember old Boon . I know you do . This mangy , old , ugly dog . Smart . People-smart , and then some . Oh , he sure did love you . He crawled up under that house ... the very day you left . Wouldn 't come out for nothin ' . Not no ham bone , nothin ' . He just knew that his life was over . You stole his heart too . You shouldn 't oughta left . [ Footsteps ] [ Gasps ] You 're there . I ... wanted to thank you . That poultice worked a miracle on my back . I was about to knock and ... and ask if I could get a little more . Whatever that is , it sure is stinky . Stinky 's good . [ Chimes Ringing ] [ Woman ] Good afternoon . Can I help you ? Yeah , we 're looking for some alternative medical advice . Well , you 've come to the right place . I get a lot of folks fed up with their H.M.O.s. - Well , actually , we 're not here for us . - Yeah . Oh ! Chief , back in your pocket . It 's dirt . It 's goofer dust is what it is . I don 't know what your intentions are with that . - Goofer dust ? - Conjure dust , goofer dust . How would you go about making somebody sick using that ? We 're investigating a murder . That 's why I 'm asking . Oh . Speaking strictly in the academic sense , you 'd spread it on or near your victim to direct misfortune . So you could give them any illness you wanted ... - one that you chose specifically for them ? - Oh ... that 's a lot trickier . It requires something special . - A voodoo doll . - No . They 're called " puppets . " Inside , you place three thorns of a blood red rose , a strand of hair , and a photo of your victim . Maybe other items as well . Depends on the operator . Sew it up , say your spell . How would you counteract one of these ? Depends on who you 're dealing with . But if the person you 're looking for ... is powerful enough to bring about a murder , he 's probably charmed . Which would mean what ? It means just that . He 's drawing on the energy of a charm . A source of magic power . It could be any item , provided that it 's very important to him . Something that holds great meaning for him . And unless you can separate him from his charm , you 're out of luck . Poppin ' corn . You gotta put the money in first . Don 't look like no popping ' corn to me . Put it in the microwave . Then you get your popcorn . Oh . Microwave . I heard tell of such a thing . It 's a true wonder . [ Beeping ] Radiation . Come from the heart of the atom . I think it be God 's own glow . You 're gonna be very happy , I promise . The drug therapy I 'm giving her is working wonders . Come on . Come see . - Mom . - Hi , sweetie . - You look good . - Yeah , right . But I am definitely feeling better . - So how come I have to go through this thing again ? - Come on . This thing gives off about as much radiation as a dental X ray . - Nothing to worry about . - I know . It just scares me . Wish me luck ? [ Beeping ] Doctor ! Switch it off ! Switch it off ! [ Gasps ] [ Beeping ] All done . How could somebody orchestrate all of this ? You believe that your wife was murdered ? It was no accident . There was no malfunction of the machine . Yes , I believe she was murdered . And you still have no idea why ? The pathologist found this branded into your wife 's chest . Sir , we can 't help you if you withhold information from us . A man came to see me yesterday . My age , older , maybe . Tall . He mentioned someone named Lynette Peattie . I didn 't know who she was at first . Turns out she was a Jane Doe I treated last October . She was in a bus rollover . Came in amid a wave of victims . She was the worst off . I could barely put fluids in fast enough to keep up with the blood loss . We were rushing around triaging people . Everybody knew she was dying . It was only a matter of time . She was in agony . This was my course of treatment . [ Scully ] You gave her morphine . Lots of it . I pushed it myself . She kept screaming , and her heart rate kept climbing . So ... I kept pushing . I took maybe the last 20 minutes of her life . It was a fair trade to make for the pain . Her father doesn 't agree . What makes you think it 's her father ? He thinks you robbed him of his family . And that 's why he 's systematically robbing you of yours . What am I supposed to do ? My daughter Lucy ... You don 't do anything . Let us find a way to protect you . - How ? - I have an idea where to start . [ Scully ] If Lynette Peattie was Carlos theJackal , I would 've had an easier time tracking her down . There 's no birth certificate , no social security number , nothing . Better known to the world as Jane Doe , 6149 . Well , her name shows up once in the records ... of a Vista Inoculation Program in 1981 . - The Allegheny Mountains of West Virginia . - Deepest Appalachia . That 's when her father , one Oral Peattie , refused to allow her to be inoculated against polio . But there 's no address for him . There 's no record of him whatsoever . Mulder , why are we exhuming this girl ? Well , I 'm thinking of her dear old backwoods dad ... and where he gets all his graveyard dirt . Here ? His daughter 's grave ? The occultist we spoke to said that the person ... casting these magic spells was charmed . That he had a source of power that was very meaningful to him ... and he kept it close by . Lynette Peattie 's body ? That 's my guess . So as long as her body remains here resting in peace in the Bay Area , he remains powerful . But if we were to ship it off to Quantico ... Hold onto that . Mr. Peattie ? Mr. Peattie , my pain 's back . I was wondering if I could get a little more of that poultice . Mr. Peattie ? Oh , I 'm sorry . I didn 't know you were home . [ Screaming ] All right , thank you . They 'll be there before dark . - You all set ? - We still don 't know where it is we 're going . We rented a cabin for you . It 's important that you get out of town . And you believe by our leaving it will somehow weaken him ? Well , what 's important is that he believes that . At any rate , if he can 't fnd you , he can 't hurt you . How do you know he 'll come forward ? Because he hasn 't gotten everything he wants . [ Man On TV ] Our ownJohn Gillness is on the scene . [ Man # 2 ] San Mateo County health offcials admit they 're at a loss ... to explain the sudden onset of the 56-year-old woman 's bizarre illness , but insist there is no cause for alarm . - Pretty weird , huh ? - There 's been no offcial diagnosis . Sources say they believe the woman contracted ... the rare but deadly Group ' A " Streptococcus ... - better known as the flesh-eating disease . - Freakin ' scary . We will keep a close watch on this story and any new developments . [ Man ] Bathroom 's clear ! [ Man # 2 ] Clear here ! [ Cell Phone Ringing ] - Scully . - Peattie may be on to us . - What happened ? - I found out where he lives , only he 's cleared out and he 's taken his magic charm with him . At least as much of it as he can carry . My guess is he 's looking for you . I didn 't see anybody following us . Well , just keep an eye out , Scully . I 'm on my way . Okay . Soon . Very soon . [ Robert ] What was that ? Stay where you are . [ Chanting , Indistinct ] Oh ! Oh , God ! - Oh ! - What is it ? I don 't know . I can 't ... - I can 't see ! - [ Banging On Door ] - Agent Scully ! - Just stay where you are . Stay down . [ Gasps ] - Oh , Doctor ! - Leave him alone ! - Daddy ! - Get back ! Get back ! Don 't make me hurt you ! [ Peattie ] Can hurt the man that ain 't got nothin 'left . You know who I be now ? Maybe you can recollect my daughter . I remember ! I never forgot ! I 'm-I 'm sorry for your loss , but I did everything humanly possible to save her ! The arrogant little man . I did everything I could ! And when I couldn 't do anymore , I eased her suffering ! By killing ' her . If I be there , I save her ! You weren 't there ! [ Peattie ] Scary death in some feld . No name on her , far away from her people . It wouldn 't be right . So now , little man , I gonna show you what be possible . I 'm gonna show you ... an eye for an eye . You 're not gonna hurt my daughter ! Daddy ! [ Sobbing ] Baby . - [ Groaning ] - Daddy ! Daddy ! Doctor ? What 's happening ? - Daddy ! - [ Gasping ] Dr. Wieder ! - [ Screaming ] - You 're killing him ! [ Sobbing ] Daddy ! Stop ! Daddy ! - Daddy ! - [ Gunshot ] [ Sobbing ] Daddy . [ Monitor Beeping ] Lynette Peattie 's body is on its way back home to O 'Neal , West Virginia . She 's going back to her people after all . You know , Mulder , I would have made the same call . As a doctor , if I was certain that I couldn 't save her life ... and she was in that much pain , - I would 've done what Wieder did . - Mm-hmm . It seems pretty clear cut . Except maybe it 's not . You 're wondering if maybe Peattie could 've saved her life ? You do keep me guessing . [ Child ] I made this !

 MAN : Carl 's Jr. has this $ 6 burger , which really only costs $ 3.95 so you think you 're getting some deal but the truth is , it may be the best franchise burger out there . I went there yesterday and ordered three . By golly , those suckers almost filled me up . When I got home , I still had to have a box of Eggos but that doesn 't take away from Carl 's achievement . I mean , here 's a guy who 's got to go ... - ... through life as Carl Junior , right ? MAN : Barry ? Like he can never get out of the shadow of his dad , the original Carl , I guess . Do you think this eating has to do with thinking you killed your mother ? That you 're eating yourself to death as punishment ? - You do think you killed her , right ? - I never said that . She called out to you from that big , fancy oak bed . - She said she was having chest pain . - I never told you any of that ! - How could you know this ? - She begged you to dial 911 . But she was always calling out for you , wasn 't she , Barry ? You weren 't there . How could you know what happened ? How ? - Doesn 't matter . Stop blaming yourself . - Doesn 't matter . If you don 't , you 'll eat yourself into an early grave for no reason . You 're looking in my head ! Stop it ! - Don 't look in there . - You don 't have to do it , Barry . BARRY : Leave me alone ! It wasn 't your fault . [ PHONE RINGING ] Jonesy ? Ah ! JONESY : Hey , how are you doing , Henry ? What 's that you say ? Are you going deaf ? How are you doing ? You know . SSDD . Well , yeah , of course . Hey , I was thinking if you were free this weekend we might go see Duddits . Yeah , absolutely . He 's been on my mind a lot too . It 's been a long time . JONES : Yeah . It 's open ! I gotta go . I got a thing here . I 'll see you Saturday . Yeah , right . See you Saturday . So , Mr. Defuniak do you know we 're both escapees from Maine ? You 're from Pittsfield . Know what happens to scholarship students caught cheating on exams ? You had the flu that day , didn 't you , David ? You didn 't take the exam ? You missed the test . And since you were ill , why not write me an essay instead ? 3000 words on the short-term results of the Norman Conquest . - Go get started . - Yes , sir . Better to be from Pittsfield than go back to it . Thank you , sir . How did you know ? You weren 't even there that day . Sometimes I just know . [ THUNDERING ] Hello . This probably won 't work . Never start like that with a car salesman . We love challenges . Pete Moore . In one hour I 'm showing a house in Fryeburg . It 's a big commission . And I just lost my damn car keys . Could you possibly make me duplicates ? - That takes at least a day . - Oh , boy , I just knew it ! Easy , Trish . Maybe I can help . I 'm always good at finding things . - Did I say my name ? I don 't remember- - - I guessed . Now , let 's find those keys . - Hey , Rachel . - Hey , Pete . - I looked again . I couldn 't find them . MOORE : Okay . I need your help . You had the coffee in your hand , bought aspirin went to your car , realized the keys were gone . - That everything ? - Yes . Look . This is gonna seem weird , but it 's just a thing I do to help me think . You bought a candy bar before the aspirin . Mars bar . Yours , right ? One more question . If I find your keys , will you let me buy you dinner ? West Wharf ? 6 : 30 ? Best fried clams in the state ? It 's right on your way back . Sure . Okay . - That 'd be nice . - All right . So you got here . You opened your purse . Coffee , candy and aspirin , you 're juggling it all around . And that 's when you dropped your keys . It 's just luck , is all . Thank you . [ CAR ALARM BEEPING ] [ CAR STARTS ] - West Wharf , right ? Half past six ? - You got it . Another fuckarow . [ THUNDERING ] [ PHONE RINGING ] - Jones . CLARENDON : How are you doing ? - Hey , Beaver.ame shit , different day . - Same shit , different day . - Wanna talk ? - No , you 're trying to get home . - What 's up ? - Really , I got nothing . Go home . - Wait , Jonesy ? - Yeah , Beav ? - You be careful . - Be careful of what ? Wish I knew . Oh , my gosh . He 's right there . Yeah . What did you say ? I didn 't say anything . Right . Sorry . Hey ! WOMAN : Oh , my God ! - Oh , my God ! MAN : Oh , look ! [ CROWD CHATTERING ] MAN : Somebody call an ambulance ! WOMAN 1 : It won 't do any good . MAN : I looked away for one second . Then I heard a thump . What happened ? WOMAN 1 : Careful , careful . WOMAN 2 : Back up , back up . WOMAN 1 : Seriously ... . DEFUNIAK : My God ! Professor Jones ! I just saw him . He can 't die ! WOMAN 2 : Is he dead ? WOMAN 1 : I didn 't see it . Why did he run out ? Clear ! No good . Flatline . Hit it again ! Clear ! - What do you think ? - I think it 's no good . I think he 's gone . Watch out for Ister Gay . [ MAN MUMBLING ] [ MAN LAUGHING ] DEVLIN : Out of my way . CLARENDON : Jonesy , don 't try to lift that stuff . DEVLIN : Just go up to the cabin . MOORE : Here , here , look . Big jacket . - Beaver , I 'm going in ! CLARENDON : I 'll see you in a second ! [ GLASS CLINKING ] DEVLIN : Watch the beer . - Got blown last night . MOORE : Good for you . - First time ? - Bite my bag . Met some lady at bingo , went back to her place , turned into a nice fuckaree . - As opposed to a fuckarow . - Obviously . Though I 've had perfectly good fuckarees turn into fuckarows in a flash . - Try Viagra . - Viagra ? I 'm practically at full salute all day . I 'm ... . What do you call it ? Privatic ? Prag- - Prasmatic ? Henry will know . - You 're thinking of fourth grade . - You 're having wood problems ? - You haven 't tried it , have you ? - Hell , no ! Drop that little blue bomb , you 're hard as a Louisville Slugger for 12 hours . Twelve hours ? I 'm talking Yastrzemski . You don 't have to need it to love it . Bingo ? Did you say bingo , like the game in church basements ? - There 's trim there . - Beaver ! I thought my deal was pathetic . - Ah ! - You just watch . That 's your job . JONES : I 'm fine . DEVLIN : Uh-huh . H , you been thinking about Duddits more than usual ? Uh-huh . Remember we were gonna go see him that weekend ? - I remember . - Then I got hit . I gotta tell you something weird . The night I got hit , I was standing there and across the street , I saw Duddits . Just like he was that day we first saw him back in Derry . He was calling out for help and everyone was ignoring him . Then he looked over at me . He looked directly at me . And he motioned for me to come to him . You believe I saw him , don 't you ? Yes , sir , I do . Duddits loves me , I know that . He loves us all . He would die before he 'd ever hurt us . So why was he calling me into the street to get hit ? Maybe there 's more to the story we don 't get yet . - You don 't know shit . MOORE : Name it ! I 'll name it after we come up with a small wager . - 50 bucks . - What 's the subject ? In the movies , when people wake up together they immediately start kissing and going at it . But they never get up first , take a leak and brush their goddamn teeth . Which is pretty much necessary when you wake up . What 's it called when you got a constant woody ? - You mean priapism . - See ? I 'm practically priasmic . Priapismic . - Whatever ! It 's hard . - That 's what you 're betting on ? I can name the one movie where they acknowledge the scuzzy facts of life . - I 'll give you a quarter . - A quarter from you . 50 bucks from you . - Promised Land . - Promised Land ? Never heard of it . Meg Ryan and what 's his name ? Reefer Sutherland . - Kiefer . - From , I don 't know , 1988 or something ? So Meg Ryan wakes up in the morning and says , " Where 's the cat ? " And he says , " What cat ? " And she says , " The cat that shit in my mouth . " That will be 50 small . - Bullshit ! You made it up . - Could Beaver make that up ? You can have that priceless piece of cinematic trivia absolutely free . I 'm filing that in the " Who-gives-a-shit " section of my memory warehouse . [ CHUCKLING ] - What 's the memory warehouse ? - You don 't remember ? - I must 've forgot . - You forgot the memory warehouse ? - Just remind me . Don 't give me shit . - lt 's in his head . We 've all got one . - Hasn 't that place been condemned ? JONES : Not yet . It 's so crowded I throw something out every time I learn something new . When I got my new laptop I had to throw out my files of rock ' n ' roll lyrics . My warehouse was washed away in a flood about 10 years ago . I didn 't know they had enough beer . Hey . Hey , hey . Jonesy , if that really is your name ... - ... what do you do with the old files ? - I burn them . - You threw out the " Blue Bayou " lyrics ? - No . No , if I really can 't let go of something I sneak it back to an office where I keep my secret stuff . Where do you keep the stuff on Duddits ? He 's got a special section all his own on the third level . I can 't stop thinking about the Duds lately . How about you guys ? It 's this place . He 's all around here , even though he 's never been here . This is our 20th year coming out here to Hole in the Wall . And fuck me , Freddy , here 's to 20 more . Yeah . Twenty more . Here 's to Duddits our dreamcatcher . Wish he was here . To the Duds . - To Douglas Cavell . - To Duddits . Why is Tina Schlossinger 's pussy on the wall of Tracker Brothers ? Because I said so . It 's a picture . - Have you seen it ? JONESY : No but the kid who sits behind me in shop , he saw it . HENRY : Tracker Brothers is deserted . JONESY : You don 't want to see the homecoming queen 's pussy ? Don 't come . Fuck me , Freddy ! Some kid 's shirt . - So ? - lt 's new ! Scooby-Doo . " I belong to Douglas Cavell . " " If the boy I belong to is lost , please bring him to 19 Maple Lane , Derry . " Must belong to one of those kids from the Retard Academy . [ SCREAMING ] BOY : Come on . Eat it . Eat it . Eat it and you can go . Hey , you guys ! Quit it ! Just fucking quit it ! What are you doing ? You 're trying to make him eat that ? What 's wrong with you ? RICHIE : Got it . I 'll make him eat this dog turd , then he can go . You go now . Unless you want half . Take a hike , girls , while you have the chance . Piss off . That 's your final warning . [ DUDDITS WHIMPERING ] - You better watch it ! - Why is that ? - I know who you are . - I 'm trembling with fear . - You 're Rich Grenadeau , the quarterback ! - So ? What will people say when we tell them what we caught you doing ? You won 't tell anybody anything because you 'll be dead . - Get ready , Pete . - Give the word , Henry . Pete can fly . When you come for us , all we have to do is get in your way . I can 't catch that little dick ? You know who that is ? That 's Pete Moore . That 's right , fat-ass . Pete Moore . No one can catch him . He 's going straight to his house to tell his mother . She 'll call the cops and then we 'll see . - You know him , is that it ? - Never saw him . Then why ask for trouble ? I mean , look at this moron ! - He likes this attention . - How do you know what he likes ? Come on , you dickweeds ! - You want to fight us ? - Yes ! Yes ! I 'm gone , Henry . Just say the word . - Why ? You 'll lose ! Why ? - Because you can 't do that ! It 's wrong ! And I 'm gonna tell the world ! Tell everybody ! - You want us to leave , is that it ? - No ! Let 's kick their asses ! Let 's go . We 'll get him later . You know that . Get you all later . [ DUDDITS SCREAMING ] HENRY : It 's okay . You can stop now . Do something . Somebody ! If I do and you tell anybody , I 'll never hang with you guys again . [ SINGS " BLUE BA Y OU " ] HENRY : I never knew Beav could sing . - Beaver , that 's beautiful . - I mean it . Not one word . Eaver ! You 've got a fan . This yours ? [ SINGS SCOOBY-DOO THEME SONG INCORRECTL Y ] Douglas Cavell . That 's your name , right ? I Duddits . PETE : What ? - I Duddits ! HENRY : Duddits ? - Duddits . Duddits , we got to get you home . Hey , guys ! Come here ! Leave the kid there . Stand right here , Duddits . Right here with Scooby , okay ? Jesus Christ bananas ! No way is that Tina Jean Schlossinger . HENRY : Maybe her grandmother . Good going , Beav . Holy God . We came all the way here just for that ? No . We came for him . DEVLIN : Hey , Pete . You forgot the dogs . Uh-oh . Weather moving in . Double storm . Alberta Clipper first , maybe 8 inches with a nor 'easter on its tail . - Get on back to the cabin , Henry . - Heading straight there , Mr. G. - Don 't mess around . DEVLIN : No , sir . [ CRACKING ] [ GASPING ] [ SCREAMS ] JONES : Easy , fella . Easy . You 're okay . You 're all right . Thank God . Thank God . Gee , thank God ! I 'm lost . I 've been lost in the woods since yesterday . Let 's get you inside . Get you warm . - How would that be ? - Sure . Here , let me get that . - Rick McCarthy . - Gary Jones . It 's Jonesy to everybody . Our damn cell phones are on the blink now , so I can 't call for help but our car will be back soon . I didn 't think I 'd make it . I lost the folks I was with . You saved me , that 's for sure . What 's that ? It 's a dreamcatcher . Indian charm . Catches nightmares keeps them away . Keeps you safe down here . I 've had enough nightmares . [ BURPS ] Been doing that all night . I ate some berries in the dark . I think they must have upset me . [ BOTTLES CLINK ] MOORE : I know what you 're thinking . Anyone who drinks at 11 a.m. needs to take the cure , but I only do it here . In the real world , I never drink till after 5 : 00 and if it ever does , I 'm on the wagon for life . Glad to hear it . What 's the matter with you ? About six months ago , the day Jonesy got hit I did something terrible with a patient . I humiliated him . Drove him out . Barry Neiman . Couple days ago , I saw his picture in the paper . He ate himself to death . Mind if I don 't use that story next time I 'm trying to sell a Mustang ? You were a lead balloon long before this porker munched his way to eternity . Thanks . You 're a real comfort . You got a real delicate touch to you . JONES : Here you go , Rick , buddy . That will fix you up . [ DOOR OPENS ] CLARENDON : Jesus Christ bananas ! Some fuckarow this is turning into ! - Thanks a lot , Beav . CLARENDON : Yeah , I think I got it all . What happened to you ? Hi . Joe Clarendon . Call me Beaver . JONES : Rick here had a bad night in the woods . Welcome . - ls that frostbite ? - No , I get the same thing from peanuts . It 's allergy . Grilled cheese , anyone ? MCCARTHY : No , the soup 's fine for me . CLARENDON : I 'll bite . Sail it over here . My mother used to feed me pea soup when I was feeling- - [ BURPING ] Bitch in a buzz saw ! I 've heard some mighty burps in my time , but that 's the blue ribbon . I am so embarrassed . - Rick ate some berries in the woods . MCCARTHY : Oh , no . [ FARTING ] Oh , my God ! Oh , my God , that 's awful ! I 'm so sorry ! Rick , buddy , don 't worry about it . There 's more room out than in , anyway . What have you been eating , woodchuck turds ? JONES : Know what I think ? I think you need to lie down and take you a little nap . You know , I bet you 're right . I 'm just tired , that 's all . - Come on . - My hat . Beaver ? Come on . In here . Thank you for taking me in . Thank you both . - Shit , anybody would have . - Maybe . Maybe not . All right , this is in case you have to urk if you can 't get to the bathroom , which is the third door to your left . If you go in the first , you 'll take a shit in the closet . If you need anything , we 're outside . [ STOMACH GURGLING ] [ CHUCKLING ] Fuck me , give me some air ! We got any gas masks handy ? We need a biohazard team in here . [ LAUGHING ] - Wanna hear what 'll freak you out more ? - Not really . You know his huge stomach ? When he got here , his stomach was normal , but his chest was out to here ! I wish Henry was here . He 's a shrink , not an internist . He went to med school . Did you ? I thought about it . You better get a run at it . DEVLIN : Shit ! MOORE : Watch it ! What the hell ? DEVLIN : Pete , are you okay ? MOORE : I broke my leg ! My damn leg ! - Okay . Hang on . Hang on a second . - Help me ! - I 'm caught ! I can 't- - DEVLIN : God ! - God . - Henry ! A little help here ! DEVLIN : Hang on , Pete . Hang on . - Okay . Here comes the seat belt . - I just opened that beer . [ MOORE LAUGHING ] I got you . How 's your leg ? Well , it ain 't broken . It 's just locked up , is all . You don 't suppose he got exposed to radiation ? I saw that once in a movie . Guy ended up bald as Telly what 's-his-fuck . This guy 's got plenty of hair . But that red mark got bigger while I watched it . - What are you doing ? - Peanut butter calms me down . - Somebody else might want to use that . - I 'll leave some . Beav . Beaver . [ CROWS CAWING ] CLARENDON : Criminettlies ! DEVLIN : I think it 's a woman . MOORE : I ought to warn you . I 'm gonna strangle this broad . - I 'd guess she 's already dead . - I 'll strangle her anyway . She almost got us both killed . Hello ! Here we come , ma 'am . Don 't be startled . Hello ? Forget it , H. She 's gone . Hello ! [ MOORE SCREAMING ] Ma 'am , can you hear me ? Are you okay ? Can you hear me ? [ FARTING ] I wonder if maybe that 's how they say hello around here . Listen , Miss Road Kill , you almost got us dead . Say something . I have to find Rick . - Okay . - Rick . Yeah . CLARENDON : Fuck me , Freddy . - What 's all that red stuff on their fur ? - Just like McCarthy 's cheek . - I never saw anything like this before . - Even the bears look scared . - Of what ? Where are they going ? - lt 's not where that worries me it 's what are they running away from ? [ HELICOPTER HOVERING ] What the hell ? This could be perfect . They can get Stinky to a hospital . Hey , you guys ! We need help ! Got a sick guy inside !

CLARENDON : We got a real sick guy ! - Take him with you now ! MAN : Glad you 're okay . This situation will be resolved in 24 to 48 hours . Kiss my bender ! MOORE : I gotta ask you , old buddy . Because I 'm confused . - ls this SSDD or not ? DEVLIN : Definitely not . Different shit today , Pete . And a pretty weird day so far , if you want to know . MOORE : Over here . [ MEN GROANING ] DEVLIN : Okay . There you go . MOORE : Easy . [ STOMACH GURGLING ] DEVLIN : Nine miles to Hole in the Wall . [ FARTING ] DEVLIN : I think I can manage it . I 'll bring the snowmobile back and get you both . Now , Pete , you listen to me . Don 't go back to the car for beer . - Stay with her . Keep her warm . - Right hand to God , Dr. D. Henry ! If we die before you get back promise you 'll tell everybody she wasn 't my date . - I don 't like this . - Me neither . Not at all . This is turning into a double fuckarow . A real jobba-nobba . - Rick , you okay ? MCCARTHY : I 'm a little sick , fellas . - I just need to make a little room . - McCarthy , Rick , open up , man . MCCARTHY : Go away ! - Open the door or we break it down . MCCARTHY : Can 't a man have privacy ? - Rick , where are you bleeding from ? MCCARTHY : Bleeding ? I 'm not bleeding . - Let 's do it . - I 'm not positive I wanna go in there . What if he 's dying ? Scooby-Dooby-Doo , we got some work to do now . On three . Ready ? One ... . Two ... . Hold it ! What if we just bounce off ? - No bounce , no play . - Right . No bounce , no play . One ... . And a two ... . Three ! Oh , fuck ! Oh , man ! Fuck ! I don 't want to see this ! I can 't see this . - Shut up a minute . Mr. McCarthy ? Rick ? - ls he still alive ? I don 't know . Rick ? Rick , are you- - ? [ WATER SPLASHES ] Oh , man ! Jonesy , if he can still do that , he must be alive . Can you hear me ? I think he 's dead . Bullshit ! He dropped a clinker ! I heard it . - I don 't think that was a clinker . - That 's enough , snap out of it ! - Oh , my God ! - My God ! [ WATER SPLASHING ] - No ! - No ? No . Good move ! It 's trapped . Got nowhere to go but the septic tank . [ TOILET FLUSHES ] Okay . CLARENDON : Oh , shit ! - Listen , we 're gonna change places . - What ? - One of us is gonna go to the shed . - No way ! Shut up and listen ! There 's friction tape there . You go get it , come back . We 'll tape the lid down . Then we 're gonna get the hell out of here ! - You get the tape , Jonesy . - Don 't be brave , Beav . You 're faster than me . I 'll sit on Thumper . No , if it does get out , you can 't fight it . Not with your hip . Oh , my God ! Goddamn it ! Go ! - And Beav ? - Yeah ? Sit tight , buddy . [ CHUCKLES ] Okay . Okay . [ CLARENDON SCREAMS ] [ SINGS " BLUE BA Y OU " ] All right . Okay .

[ SCREAMING ] [ SNARLING ] Where is it ? Coming , Beav ! Beaver ! Beav ! I got the- - What the- - ? Jonesy , get out of here ! Beaver . - Get out ! Shut the door ! - No . Run , Jonesy . [ SNARLING ] [ GROANS ] You killed him . You killed Beaver . You killed him , you fuck ! Ah ! What do you want ? [ JONES GASPING ] [ MEN MUMBLING ] CURTIS : They call the red stuff Ripley , after the broad in the Alien movies . We eradicate the animals as they flee the Blue Zone . OWEN : The populace ? CURTIS : We bring civilians to Gosselin 's . We 'll detain them till we figure this out . And , Owen ? This time the ETs belong to you . That 's right , bucko . - You 'll be Blue Boy leader . - Finally . - How many left ? - About a hundred . Yeah . Not nearly enough for a serious incursion . My guess is , it 's a crash-landing . They 've never picked terrain like this before or cold weather . OWEN : What 's your call ? The biggest threat is them getting out of our net . Crash-landing or not they 'll try to get out and spread the infection . I always say they never visited a world they wouldn 't rather own . They 're up to their old tricks . Using a standard grayboy look with the innocent doggy eyes and smooth baby-butt skin . They project what they think we want to see . But I 've had a look at the real thing . You wouldn 't want it marrying your sister . - Difference of opinion about the Ripley . - Really ? Who has an opinion ? - Who do you think ? - General Matheson . - Three-star General Matheson . - Three ? - When did you see him ? - They called me in yesterday . What 's the opinion of those enlightened cocksuckers who 've never been near an ET ? They say the fungus doesn 't take hold in all victims . Some of them get over it . Really ? And what about the shit weasels ? The ones blasting out the basement door ? Does Matheson think folks get over one of those puppies ? Their theory is , they only grow in a small percentage of the exposed population . Do you like that theory , bucko ? I think it 's crap . CURTIS : So if you thought someone had been exposed ... - ... and you had them in your grasp- - - I wouldn 't want them walking out ... - ... to wander as they wish . - Bucko , I think we 're on the same page . Pissing in the same latrine . If the Ripley gets out of this pine-tree paradise ... . Well , it just can 't be allowed to do that . I 've quarantined the entire area . - Nothing leaves alive . - Roger that , boss . [ KNOCKING ] Come ! Got Maples here , boss . - Corporal Maples , sir . I mean , boss . CURTIS : I know who you are , Maples . I handpicked every man in Blue Boy . Sometimes I wonder about my judgment . MAPLES : Yes , sir . I 'm sorry , boss . CURTIS : Do you know the catechism ? - Yes , the B.U.C. for all buckos . - ls Blue Unit part of regular Army ? - No , boss . Better . CURTIS : How does Blue Unit operate ? Under the radar . We don 't salute , display rank , say " sir . " A force unto ourselves . - Regular Army compared to Blue Unit ? - Pussies . CURTIS : What rules does it operate by ? MAPLES : Rules of combat . That 's right , laddie . When a soldier disobeys a superior 's orders , he puts everyone at risk . And is to be punished immediately by appropriate command personnel . That 's me . Capisce ? Good . Now answer me one question and you can boogie out of here . But you have to answer honestly . You were on containment detail at 0600 this morning , sector 14 of Blue Zone . Did you allow a young woman and her 4-year-old daughter to exit the zone in their own vehicle on Hickam Valley Road ? Colonel Curtis , she hadn 't been in the zone . She made a wrong turn . She couldn 't have been contaminated . You know this for a fact ? Or because she told you so ? - For a fact , boss . - Scout 's honor ? Can you raise your hand and tell me honestly that you know this for a fact ? Then do it , Maples . Swear on it . Scout 's honor . Scout 's honor . [ SCREAMING ] Stop your blatting , laddie-buck ! You just avoided a court-martial , boy . You lie to me again , you 'll be facing a firing squad . - Get him out before I change my mind . OWEN : Let 's get him out of here . Sentry ! - Jesus , Abe . - I warned him . Could have gotten off with a slap on the wrist . - instead of taking his whole hand ? - He crossed the Curtis line ! He came into my house , told me lies . - You think I 'm crazy , Owen ? - A little . I lost my temper there . But that little worm did something worse . The pretty mom he let pass this morning ? She 's down at the barn right now crawling with the Ripley . Twenty-five years , Owen . Twenty-five years I 've been going out to fight these alien bastards show them they picked the wrong place , knocked on the wrong door . And frankly , laddie , the tank is running a little low . Luckily for me , there 's one bit of good news in this blizzard of bullshit . I have you . To lead the assault today and to take over for me tomorrow . - What are you talking about , Abe ? - lt 's my last dance , Owen . From now on , you will lead the band . - You know where I got that ? - John Wayne . That 's right . He gave it to me . And now I 'm giving it to you . - Abe , I don 't know how to ... . - Let 's not get all girlie with each other . - Just tell me how we do it . - We go in fast and hard . - How do we come out ? - Clean and smiling . Ah . MOORE : Honey , I 'm home . That 's a good idea . Catch a little shuteye . Save your energy for those horrendous farts ! [ CHUCKLING ] MOORE : Well , it 's very nice of you to say so . I find you very attractive also . You 're one of those rare women who can handle the full-size Ford Expedition . The truck that handles like a luxury car . A really big luxury car . [ GIGGLING ] But seriously , folks , there is one issue I 'd like to bring up just in case I should , you know , kick the bucket out here turn into a goddamn Petesicle . Not that I think that 's inevitable . I 'm sure Henry or Jonesy or Beaver will be coming to get us soon . They 're my friends . We 're all best friends . Now , ma 'am , I 'll be very candid with you about this so please , don 't get freaked out or think that I 'm some kind of weirdo who you shouldn 't meet for the best fried clams in Maine . Just some innocent fried clams at the West Wharf ! You see , the four of us , best friends we all have this other friend by the name of Duddits . And our friend Duddits , well , he 's not your average old buddy . One day , a long time ago , he gave us all this kind of gift . It 's this ... . How shall I put it ? This ability . This ability to know things to talk to each other without talking at all , just mind-to-mind . Do you see what I 'm getting at ? I knew you would . Lately , I 've been having this dream and in the dream , I understand how Duddits could give us a gift like that . I think maybe our friend Duds is not from this planet . I think Duddits is from somewhere else and he came here to prepare us for something . It 's crazy . Talking shit about the only perfect person I ever knew . He 's so goddamned good . I can 't believe he 's a human . I should be singing his praises , not questioning what galaxy he 's- - I gotta pee . That 's what I should do . [ GROANING ] [ ZIPPER OPENS ] Here 's to you , Duds . The highest civilian decoration . Lord , I will never drink again . [ SCREAMING ] [ SNARLING ] [ SCREECHING ] [ SNARLING ] DEVLIN : Let me get this straight . Yesterday you want to call it quits , throw in the towel , pull the plug . Today , you 're begging , praying . Couple more hours . Couple more miles . Make up your mind . [ JET SKI HUMS ] Jonesy ! Way to go , motherfucker ! Here you come to save the day ! What the hell ? Who 's Mr. Gray ? What are you trying to tell me , Jonesy ? You 're not Jonesy . IN ENGLISH ACCENT : What was that , Mr. Jones ? What did we just pass ? JONES : Are you speaking to me ?

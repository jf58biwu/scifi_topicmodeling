 Oblongs , Oblongs Down in the valley where a chemical spill Came from the people living up on the Hill There 's a family by the landfill with hazardous foam In their happy glowing home Oblongs We now return to Velva , The Warrior . Your orbs of ecstasy are mine , all mine . Even Velva can 't save you now . We must rescue Majora from the evil Testiclees . I can ride my horse , Fallopius . Or take my boat , The Cervix . But we don 't know if she 's being held in Scrotor 's castle or the Vast Deferens forest . It 's a good thing we have these action figures to help plan our rescue . Yes , they make excellent gifts for Christmas , Hanukkah or as a substitute for love . I 'll save you , Majora . Velva is a baby game. I 'm gonna go drain the brake fluid out of the car . Come on , Beth . This is our morning for the farmer 's market . You know , I sample the hard ciders while you dance for nickels . No , I have to get to Majora . Help me , Mommy . Okay . Let 's kill Majora . You 're not committing . I 'm not buying it . Sorry , baby. I 'm on day two of a three-day hangover . Forget it. I 'll play with the cat . - Bob , can we talk ? - Sure thing . Let me just change this bulb . Okay , sugar. I 'm all ears . Sorry . Little dizzy there . - All Beth cares about is that stupid Velva . - Are you worried she 'll become a lesbian ? Let 's just try to put this out of our minds . I know . Let 's go to the mall . Fallopius , to the cave ! That 's odd. I just topped off the brake fluid . Hey , that chick 's giving us the eye . - Hey , baby . - Want to make a baby ? Leave the mannequin alone . A framed photo of the family with novelty backdrop . They can put us in front of the Great Wall of China on a gondola in Venice or at the flaming gates of hell . Hell ! I hope I don 't get sued for this . Hungry . Gotta pee . Hungry . Gotta pee . Look , they 've got the entire land of Velva . Mommy , Daddy , I want the Velva doll . - You have to buy the whole set . - No can do . See , I 'm what you 'd call a low earner . I 'm sorry , baby. I 'd like to but we just splurged on that jumbo pack of two-ply toilet paper . That extra ply really gives you something to grip between your teeth . I wish Velva was my mommy . - Beth , wait ! - No , let her go . Honey , she 's leaving with those gypsies . I feel like I 'm losing my baby girl . If I could get her that stupid Velva doll then maybe she 'd start liking me again . That Velva 's very popular . My " Tuesday Nights with Velva " really packs them in . We all do a shot every time someone says , " Slash at his groin . " What 's this ? " Win a five-minute all-you-can-grab shopping spree at your local mall . " Hey , if you win , that would give you a chance to get that doll . With time left over to grab a heated wig stand at Hammacher Schlemmer . Nothing worse than putting on an icy-cold wig . Don 't I know it , sister . Okay , I 've gotta be smoking constantly . I 'm gonna win even if I have to inhale ... - ... through a hole in my neck . - That 's my girl . Can 't you just open them and look for the winner ? You have to smoke to the filter to see if you 've won . They wanna make sure you actually suck the stuff into your lungs . Clever rascals . Crap . Mom , that 's not even the right brand . Hey , I 'm taking a smoke break . Smoke , smoke , smoke ! I can 't take another drag . You have to while there 's a break in the hemorrhaging . - My God , you did it . - You got the shopping spree ! Beth , honey , I 'm gonna get you that doll . I 'm in flavor country . Hi there . John Litvack , assistant VP promotions for Le Smoke . Here you go , kids . Enjoy . Excuse me , sir , but we 're impressionable minors . Exactly . They 're great after a session of heavy petting . - Got anything I can dip , chew and spit ? - Yes , yes and yes . Okay , sweetie , it 's a big mall . So pace yourself by doing that gay race-walking thing . You watch , Bob . I 'm gonna get that toy truck . It 's a doll , Pickles . You want the doll . Take your mark , Mrs. Oblong . Get set , shop ! Go , Mommy , go ! Did you get my doll ? I guess that means no . Time . I let my baby down . It 's all because of these damn cigarettes . That 's it. I 'm quitting . She didn 't mean it , folks . Cigarettes don 't kill people . Cancer does . But cigarettes cause cancer . Nobody move . Wow , someone 's up early . And arranging daffodils . Your cigarette withdrawal seems to be going swimmingly . - Oh , God , I 'm sorry . - No , no , I understand . It 's only expected that you have irrationally violent moments like that . I 'm sorry , but you were asking for it that time . You don 't know how hard this is . I 've lost my best friend . Pickles , I thought I was your best friend . Yeah , that 's sweet . And what the hell am I supposed to do with my smoking hand ? Please , just don 't hit me with it . Pickles , what are you doing ? Suddenly , all my senses are back . I just discovered that everything has a smell , and I don 't like it . - Did you know vomit tastes bad ? - Yes , I 've heard rumors to that effect . Oh , God. I smell feet ! And lots of them . She 's scaring me . - Me too . - Yeah . I have a hammer , and I 'll use it . Oh , my God. I think I can smell Grammy decaying . I 'll go mask it with lavender water . Forget it. I gotta get away from this stink . I 'll be at The Rusty Bucket . - Wait a minute . Now I smell something . - Sorry . She frightened me . I 'm proud of you , girlfriend . You 're breaking free of the chains of addiction . Casting off the- - - Pickles , you 're lighting your finger on fire . - Oh , for crying out loud . Look at that . That was a perfectly good finger . All right , I gotta quit the booze too . No ! I mean , why ? Smoking and drinking go together . Like porn and nachos . The money you 've spent here has paid for the first half of a very expensive operation . - What operation ? - Sorry . Boundaries . This is gonna keep your mind off smoking and drinking . Did I tell you Willy 's big , black and quite the inspirational leader ? - A hundred times , Bob . - There he is . He 's a good friend . Yo , Willy , what 's up ? What the hell is that ? Hey , you 're in my flexing radius . Now you 're in my cardio zone . Hey , this is fun . - Hold it . - l 'm sorry , Willy . - Please don 't call the police . - No , no , this woman 's got some potential . Why don 't you take her to the boxing gym ? Take that , bitch . Damn , she 's scary . She belongs in the cellar . Okay , scumbags , we got your girl-on-guy bare-knuckle brawling . Get your bets in . Say good night , pal . You were supposed to fight that guy . This here is the simple kid who fills the soda machine . Pickles , maybe it 's time for us to go . I can 't , Bob . Don 't you see what 's happening ? No , but I do admit I 'm curious to see how this is going to play out in the bedroom . It 's the first time in a week I haven 't wanted a cigarette or a drink . - Who 's next ? - Sweetie , Brandi 's intermediate Pilates starts in five minutes . There 'll be kiwi juice . Come on . You , you and you , let 's go . What have you done with Majora ? Tell me ! You will find her at the base of the shaft . I 've never been near a shaft . If only I had a map or some manner of guidebook . Velva , the very guidebook you request . Yes , it 's called All Things Velva . And I 'll be signing it this weekend at : Hill Valley Mall . Give me it ! Locar the Atrocious says go away . But I want to watch Neil Simon 's California Suite . - There 's only one way to solve this . - Right , into the naughty corner . - Nope , a knockdown-dragout fight . - Say what now ? To offset the size difference , Beth , you can use a sock full of quarters . Darling , don 't you think you 're taking this fighting thing too far ? Oh , I got you . You 're threatened because I 'm a strong woman , aren 't you ? Male chauvinist pig . You 're like that awful Bobby Riggs . Oh , good lord . Let the man rest in peace . Got anything that hasn 't been slaughtered yet ? I like to look my meat in the eye before I eat it . All our stuff comes dead . They never let me kill nothing . Look at all the naked cows . Hold this one steady , baby . I 'm getting cold and bloody . All right , stick them up . Put 20 pounds of veal cutlets into a sack , quick-like . You want those breaded ? I make my own breading . Lady , you just bought that ham . Mommy , you 're a hero ! Just like Velva . I just did what I thought was right , and I wasn 't ashamed to do it with sausage . " Shame and sausage . " l bet you can 't say that three times fast . Boy , do you have a hall pass ? Now I want to open the floor to a little Q and A. This is a public school . They don 't understand letters . Mrs. Oblong , I want to thump some ass too . But will that make me any less of a woman ? No , but scratching your butt with a salad fork will . I learned that the hard way . What happened to those meaty , meaty sausages ? - Sorry . Evidence . - Hey , Ob-dong 's mother , you 're a weirdo . is there a question from that bully-boots Jared Klimer and his little sister Blaine ? You shut up , Mrs. Ob-dong . You think you 're so big . I don 't think. I know . Oh , yeah ? If you 're so tough I guess you 'd have no problem trying to street luge . My mommy can do anything , and you 're a stinker . Thank you , sweetie . Sorry . Asthma . Pickles , please don 't do this . You could get hurt . Mommy 's like Velva . - Except Mommy 's boobies hang down , and- - - Thank you , sweetie . Thank you . Mrs. Oblong , on behalf of the entire clubhouse I 'd like to present you with this official good-luck scarf . - Wow , this smells a little gamy . - We made it out of my gym romper . Now all you gotta do is lay on the skateboard and ride it down the hill . How do I know if I 've won ? - lf you live , you win . - Here goes nothing . - Yeah , Mom ! - Yeah ! All right ! - Got any spare change ? - Get a job . - Mommy ! - Pickles ! I guess I win . Pickles , you scared the noodles out of me . My noodles too . Don 't ever do that again . You 're right . You 'd have to be crazy to do something like that . I 'm just glad it 's over . Honey ? I 'll meet you at home . We 're gonna die ! We 're gonna die ! Less whining , more wheelies . Thank you for agreeing to meet me in the back yard . What I have to say is not front-yard talk . The fact is , you 've replaced your previous addictions with thrill-seeking . Oh , Bob , it 's not an addiction . It 's just an overwhelming need that controls my life . That 's a rattlesnake ! I 've timed this so I only have 1 5 minutes to get to the pharmacy for the antivenom . - Son of a- - - Would you be a love and help me to the car ? I 'm paralyzed . Oh , lordy . Kids , start the car . Hey , Bob , do me a favor and throw some glass in my eyes ! Want a banana ? Too slow . Your behavior has gotten us banned from the zoo for life . And you know how I like to ride the tortoise . - What 's all this ? - We 're base jumpers , dude . We jump off stuff . Buildings , antennae , spans and something that starts with E. Base jumping , huh ? I 'm cheating death ! No , I 'm not . Dibs on his chute . Hey , Mom , wanna play some Russian roulette ? - How many bullets ? - One in every chamber . I 'm in . I 'm sorry for the deception , but ding-dang it , this is an intervention . Milo , be a dear and shoot Mommy in the head . Dad will get mad . I had low self-esteem . My therapist has me stand naked in front of a mirror every day repeating : " You 're beautiful . " And you know what ? I am beautiful . Yes . Well , anyway , this behavior has to stop . - For the sake of your loved ones . - Yeah. I 'm the crazy one in this family . I dragged home a salad bar from the Sizzler yesterday , and no one even noticed . He 's spilling the Bac-Os . I 'm sorry , everyone . No more dangerous stunts , I promise . As soon as I jump off the top of the Globocide office tower . Bitchen ! I 'm watching that . I 'll bet your guts come out like mushroom soup . Would you boys shut up , please ? Your mother is not jumping off of anything . I forbid it , and in this house I am the pope , the king and the sheriff . Help . He 's gonna bury me again . You can 't restrain me . You wouldn 't do this to an animal . I know , sweetie , but- - Loose harness . Loose harness . - Well , sweet dreams , honey . - Where am I gonna sleep ? You 'll be bunking with me . It 'll remind me of my days in the Navy . Open the porthole , Kowalski . I overdid it on the chipped beef . Here comes the griddle-cake train . - Milo , where 's your mother ? - l wanted my bed back . You were spooning me . I think I have enough issues , don 't you ? Pickles has flown the coop . She 's gonna jump off the Globocide tower . This is all my fault . Of course it is . But right now , we have to think about Mommy . Grammy , keep an eye on the girl . Thanks for the lift , Paco . Velva , Kiki Smiley from Excess Hollywood . Tell me , is it true that your beauty is only matched by your courage ? Yes , Kiki. I believe that 's so . Velva , I need your help . My mommy 's in trouble . - The camera still rolling ? - Yes . Velva can never resist a child 's cry for help . Let 's go ! - My eye ! - Look out ! Pickles , don 't . Wow , you 're really out of breath . - Seventy-two flights . - Why didn 't you use the elevator ? Elevator ? Son of a- - Globocide rooftop . Pigeons , suicides , hawking loogeys on pedestrians . Beth ! Since you wouldn 't listen to us , I thought maybe you 'd listen to Velva . In the unlikely event that I would ever lay with a man and bear a child I would never risk my life jumping off a building . Well , Beth , I guess I let you down again . I 'm sorry , honey , but Mommy has a problem . Mommy , please don 't jump . - Placentor , no ! - Velva , help me ! Quick , Velva , grab the chute and tuck me into your skirt . What are you , nuts ? I 'm coming , baby ! Gross . You can see up Mom 's dress . Hey , that 's my underwear ! It 's okay , baby . We made it . But you 're just gonna do it again and again until you break . No , I 'm not . When I almost lost you , I realized how you felt every time I did some crazy stunt . I 'll never do anything like that again . Darn right you won 't . Because I forbid it . Bird ! Bird ! We saw the whole thing . What a ride . Yeah , but I won 't be doing that again . It 's too dangerous . This is better than risking death any day . Now , I could go for a drink . Come on , bring the whole family . I just made a pitcher of margaritas . Okay , but no salt . That stuff will kill you . Subtitles by : BloodLogic [ english ]

You can 't lump things into two categories . Things aren 't that simple . The lifeline is divided that way . Well , life isn 't that simple . I mean , who cares if Ling Ling ... returns the wallet and keeps the money ? It has nothing to do with either fear or love . Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions . Okay . But you 're not listening to me . There are other things that need to be taken into account . Like the whole spectrum of human emotion .

Um , I know this is gonna sound kind of weird ... but , uh , do you know anything about , um , time travel ? DR. MONNITOFF : Ah , a wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge ... which is , theoretically , a wormhole in space ... controlled by man . So , according to Hawking ... a wormhole may be able to provide a shortcut ... for jumping between two distant regions of space-time . So in order to travel back in time , you have to have ... a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light ? - Theoretically . - And to find one of these wormholes ? The basic principles of time travel are there . You 've got your vessel and your portal ... and your vessel could be just about anything ... - most likely a spacecraft . - Like a Delorean ? Metal craft of any kind . You know , I love that movie , the way they shot it . It 's so , um ... like , futuristic , you know ? Listen , um , don 't tell anybody that I gave you this .

DONNIE : Roberta Sparrow . " Grandma Death . " It 's called " The Philosophy of Time Travel . " What does philosophy have to do with time travel ? - Let me see . - DONNIE : Guess who wrote it . Who ?

She lives up there in that piece of crap house ... and you know she 's loaded . She 's ... EDDIE : Yeah , you 're right . She used to be known for her gem collection . Kids ... used to go up there all the time ... and try to steal stuff from her . She became a total recluse . Huh . I didn 't even know she was alive ... till we damn near knocked her down the other day . DONNIE : She was just standing there ... in the middle of the road , frozen . So I got out of the car ... and I walked over to her to see if she was okay . And she leaned over and whispered in my ear . What did she say ? I think Frank wants me to go talk to her ... because the last time I saw him ... he asked me if I knew about time travel . She wrote a book about it ... so that can 't be a coincidence , right ? Donnie , what did Roberta Sparrow say to you ? She said that every living creature on Earth dies alone . How did that make you feel ? It reminded me of my dog , Callie . She died when I was eight ... and she crawled underneath the ... the porch . To die ? To be alone . Do you feel alone right now ? Oh , I don 't know . I mean , I 'd like to believe I 'm not , but I just ... I 've just never seen any proof , so I ... I just don 't debate it anymore , you know ? It 's like I could spend my whole life ... debating it over and over again , weighing the pros and cons ... and in the end , I still wouldn 't have any proof . So I just ... I just don 't debate it anymore . [ LAUGHS ] It 's absurd . The search for God is absurd ? It is if everyone dies alone . Does that scare you ? I don 't want to be alone .

You wanna kiss me ? - I ... I 'm sorry . - Look , Donnie , wait . - I like you a lot . - I just want it to be ... at a time when it ... When what ? When it reminds me just ... When it reminds you how beautiful the world can be ? Yeah . And right now there 's some fat guy over there staring at us . I don 't think telling any woman to forcibly insert an object up her anus ... is something that should go without consequence . I think we should buy him a moped .

I 'm not really sure that 's a good example . I think he had just cause to insult her . Rose , let me just lay out what I believe is happening here . DR. THURMAN : Donnie 's aggressive behavior ... his increased detachment from reality ... seem to stem from his inability to cope ... with the forces in the world he perceives to be threatening . Has he ever told you about his friend Frank ? Frank ? Yes , the giant bunny rabbit . The what ? I don 't recall ... him ever having mentioned a rabbit . Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called ... a daylight hallucination . [ THUMPING ] This is a common occurrence ... among paranoid schizophrenics . What can we do ? I would like to , um , do more hypnotherapy ... and increase his medication . ROSE : Whatever will help him , really ... because that 's why we 're here . We just would like him to experience some ... relief . So if you think that more medication will do that ... then I think we should give it a try . What is it like ? It 's complicated . Yeah . It 's like a force , you know , in your brain ... that just sends you someplace . Well , do you go someplace familiar ? No , but ... Actually , each time I keep waking up farther and farther from my house . That 's scary . Donnie Darko . I know . [ BOTH LAUGHING ] [ APPLAUSE ] Good morning , you Mongrels ! Good morning .

But I can still sense some students out there ... who are actually afraid to say , " Good morning ! " - Good morning ! - Yeah , that 's what I like to hear ! Because entirely too many young men and women today ... are completely paralyzed by their fears . They surrender their bodies to the temptation ... and destruction of drugs , alcohol , and premarital sex . Now , I 'm going to tell you a little story today . It 's a heartbreakingly sad story ... about a young man ... whose life was completely destroyed ... by these instruments of fear . A young man ... searching for love in all the wrong places . His name was Frank . I 'm moving through time . What ? [ FEEDBACK SQUEALS ] Hi , my stepsister ... like , I sometimes worry that she eats too much . - Shut up , Kim ! - I 'm just trying to help you . Sweetheart , please . There 's absolutely no reason to be embarrassed here . Many times we eat because we are afraid to face ... our ego reflection , all right ? We find ourselves looking at the mirror ... rather than looking into and through the mirror . When we do that ... we can finally see the reality of how beautiful we are . Thanks . Sure . Come on up here . Don 't be afraid . Hi , uh , how can I find out what I want to be when I grow up ? Oh , that 's a hard one . What I need you to do ... is look deep inside of yourself , deep within your heart ... and find what it is in the world ... that makes you feel love , pure unconditional love ... and go to that . In your studies , in your athletics ... in your relationships , go towards love . Thank you . - Come on up . - Okay . Next . What do I do to learn how to fight ? " What do I do to learn how to fight ? " Son , violence is a product of fear . Learn to truly love yourself . Truly love yourself ... and the world will be yours . Okay . Get yourself up here . All right . - Good morning . - Good morning . Um , how much are they paying you to be here ? Uh , excuse me ? JIM : What is your name , son ? Gerald . Well , Gerald ... I think you 're afraid . Are you telling us this stuff so we can buy your book ? Because I got to tell you , if you are ... that was some of the worst advice I ever heard . JIM : Do you see how sad this is ? You want your sister to lose weight ? Tell her to get off the couch , stop eating Twinkies ... and maybe go out for field hockey . You know what ? No one ever knows what they want to be when they grow up . It takes a little while to find that out . Right , Jim ? And you ... Yeah , you . Sick of some jerk shoving your head down the toilet ? Maybe you should lift some weights ... or take a karate lesson , and the next time he tries to do it ... you kick him in the balls . [ ADULTS GASP , STUDENTS LAUGH ] - JIM : Son , do you see this ? - Right ? This is an anger prisoner . A textbook example . - Anger prisoner . - Do you see the fear , people ? This boy is scared to death of the truth . Son , it breaks my heart to say this ... but I believe you are a very troubled and confused young man . I believe you are searching for the answers in all the wrong places . You 're right , actually . I am pretty ... I 'm pretty troubled ... and I 'm pretty confused , but I ... And I 'm afraid , really , really afraid . Really afraid . But I ... I think you 're the fucking Antichrist . [ AUDIENCE GASPING ] [ WHISTLING , CHEERING ] It 's amazing . The man thinks he 's telling the truth ... and everything he says is just a fucking lie ! Everything he says ! Everyone thinks he 's so rad . He 's such a fucking chud . - Everything he does ... - Are you okay ? - Yeah . - Sit down . Calm down . You ever hear of Grandma Death ? Who ? " ' The Philosophy of Time Travel . ' " What is this ? She wrote it . I 'm ... I 've been seeing stuff . Like , a lot of really messed up stuff . And there are chapters in that book that describe the stuff I 've been seeing . It can 't just be a coincidence . [ RINGS BELL ] She 's gotta be in here somewhere . She never leaves this house . Well , maybe she 's asleep . Donnie , look . FRANK : Send her a letter . DR. MONNITOFF : Each vessel travels along a vector ... through space-time , along its center of gravity . Like a spear . I beg your pardon ? Like a spear that comes out of your chest . Um , sure . And in order for the vessel to travel through time ... it 's got to find a portal , or in this case a wormhole ... Well , could these portals ... Could these portals just appear anywhere , anytime ? I think that 's highly unlikely . No , I think what you 're talking about is , um ... an act of God . If God controls time , then all time is pre-decided . I 'm not following you . Every living thing follows along a set path . And if you could see your path or channel ... then you could see into the future , right ? Like , uh , that 's a form of time travel . Well , you 're contradicting yourself . If we were able to see ... our destinies manifest themselves visually ... then we would be given a choice ... to betray our chosen destinies . And the mere fact that this choice exists ... would make all pre-formed destiny come to an end . Not if you travel within God 's channel . Um ... I 'm not going to be able to continue this conversation . - Why ? - I could lose my job . Okay . It gives me no pleasure to deny you ... the right to read one of the great writers of the 20th century ... but , alas , I have not yet been elected queen of the universe ... so I must obey the rules , and so will you . So , anyone seen in this school reading this book ... will be suspended , but not to worry . Someone has already pre-ordered a dozen copies ... at the Sarasota Mall bookstore . In Mr. Greene 's absence ... we will now be reading another classic ... " Watership Down " by Richard Adams . Here , Donnie . Be sure to pass these back . Maybe you and Frank can read this one together . [ CHUCKLES ] FRANK : Now you know where he lives . DR. THURMAN : And they grow out of our chest ... Solar plexus ? Just like she described in the book ... the way they moved and they smelled . It 's like ... like they 're workers . Assigned to each one of us . They just ... They 're like liquid . I followed it ... into my parents ' bedroom . What did you find ? Nothing . DONNIE : So we call them IMGs . Infant memory generators . The idea is that you buy these glasses for your infant ... and they wear them at night when they sleep . GRETCHEN : But inside the glasses are these slide photographs . And each photograph is of something peaceful or beautiful ... Whatever the parents want to put inside . And what effect do you think this would have on an infant ? Well ... the thing is , nobody remembers their infancy . Anyone who says they do is lying . So we think this will help develop memory earlier in life . Yeah . Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness ? That maybe darkness is part of their natural development ? - GRETCHEN : No . - Mm-mm . [ SNAPS FINGERS ] Yeah . What if the parents put in pictures of Satan ? Or , like , dead people ? Crap like that . Is that what you 'd show your kids ? Well , I mean ... didn 't your dad , like , stab your mom ? [ SCREECHES ] Get out . [ CLASS BELL RINGS ] Gretchen ! I 'm sorry , Gretchen . Gretchen , I 'm sorry about those guys . Two for " Evil Dead , " please . That 'll be $ 2 . [ SLOW POUNDING ] Why do you wear that stupid bunny suit ? Why are you wearing that stupid man suit ? Take it off . What happened to your eye ? Why do they call you Frank ? It is the name of my father ... and his father before me . Frank ? When 's this going to stop ? You should already know that . [ GIGGLES ] I want you to watch the movie screen . There 's something I want to show you . Have you ever seen a portal ? [ BELL RINGING ] Burn it to the ground . [ MUSIC PLAYS ] Okay , now , girls ... I want you to concentrate . Failure is not an option . And , Bethany , if you feel the need to vomit up there ... - just swallow it . - Okay , Mom . Hey , you guys , good luck out there . Now , that was really something . Thank you , Cherita Chen , with " Autumn Angel . " And now the moment we 've all been waiting for is here . It is my very distinct pleasure to introduce to you ... Emily Bates , Suzy Bailey ... Samantha Darko , Beth Farmer ... and Joanie James . They are ... " Sparkle Motion . " [ POP MUSIC STARTS ] [ MUSIC FADES ] [ MUTED CHEERS ] How long was I asleep for ? Whole movie . [ DISPATCHER CHATTERING OVER RADIO ] Well , look what the cat dragged in . How 're you doin ' , Donnie ? Your little sister was brokenhearted ... that you missed her big show last night . - Dad ? - Hmm ? I 'm crazy . You 're not crazy . I used to be crazy . But you 're not crazy . Look . You 're my only son . - I know ... - No , no . Hold it . I know I 'm not the best communicator ... but ... whatever happens to you ... be honest , tell the truth ... even if they do look at you funny . They will . But what you gotta understand , son ... is that almost all of those people are full of shit . They 're all part of this great big conspiracy ... bullshit . And they 're scared of people like you ... because those bullshitters know that you 're smarter than all of them . You know what you say to people like that ? Hmm ? " Fuck you . " TV REPORTER : The blaze was extinguished sometime after 8 : 00last night . Firefighters discovered what has been referred to ... as a " kiddie porn dungeon . " Cunningham , who has become a recent celebrity ... for his books and motivational tapes ... - was arrested early this morning ... - Oh , my God ! ... while golfing at the Sarasota Heights Country Club . Arson has not been ruled out as part of the cause of the fire . A group of Cunning Vision employees ... Oh , my God . Dad played golf with that guy . ... vehemently denied the alleged link ... to a child pornography publishing circuit . In a vicious statement ... Connie attacked the Middlesex fire department officials ... claiming a vast conspiracy . I 'm sorry , Karen , this is a progressive school ... but we don 't feel the methods you 've undertaken here are appropriate . What exactly about my methods are inappropriate ? I am sorry that you have failed . Now if you 'll excuse me ... I have another appointment . You can finish out the week . Fuck ! Good afternoon . It gives me great pleasure to announce ... that the Middlesex Ridge school dance team ... has been invited to perform ... on Ed McMahon 's " Star Search ' 88 " ... in Los Angeles , California . [ SILENT ] - I know now the terrible things coming . - What do you mean ? The field . The field . It 's covered with blood . RABBIT 2 : Blood ? That was ... [ BACKGROUND MUSIC SWELLS ] All right . All right , Fiver . It 's getting dark . I think we should get back to the burrow . FIVER : Back to the burrow ? It 'll come there . Don 't think it won 't . It 's all around us . Now stop it , Fiver . We 've got to go away from here . When the other rabbits hear of Fiver 's vision , do they believe him ? Why should we care ? Because the rabbits are us , Donnie . Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was human ? Are you saying the death of one species is less tragic than another ? Of course . The rabbit 's not like us . It has no history books , no photographs ... no knowledge of sorrow or regret . I mean , I 'm sorry . Don 't get me wrong . I like rabbits and all . They 're cute and they 're horny . And if you 're cute and you 're horny , then you 're probably happy ... that you don 't know who you are or why you 're even alive . You just want to have sex as many times as possible before you die . I just don 't see the point in crying over a dead rabbit ... who never even feared death to begin with . You 're wrong . These rabbits can talk . They 're the product of the author 's imagination ... and he cares for them , so we care for them . Otherwise , we 've just missed the point . Aren 't we forgetting about the miracle of storytelling ? The deus ex machina , the god machine ? That 's what saved the rabbits . [ DOORBELL RINGS ] No , it was ridiculous . I 'll call you back . - Rose . - Kitty . I 'm sure you 're aware of the horrible allegations ... against Jim Cunningham . I know , I saw it on TV . Something about a " kiddie porn dungeon . " Please , please . Don 't use those words ! It 's obviously some kind of conspiracy ... to destroy an innocent man . I have taken it upon myself to spearhead ... the Jim Cunningham defense campaign . Rose ... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning . As you know , the girls are scheduled to leave ... for Los Angeles in the morning . As their coach , I was the obvious choice ... to chaperone them on their trip ... But now ... you can 't go . - Yes . - Hmm . Believe me , of all the other mothers ... I would never dream of asking you . But none of the other mothers are available to go . I don 't know , Kitty . It 's a bad weekend . Eddie 's in New York . Rose ! I don 't know if you realize ... what an opportunity this is for our daughters ! This has been a dream of Samantha 's ... and all of ours for a long time . I made her lead dancer ! Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion . Elizabeth will be in charge . She 'll drive you to therapy . If you need anything , you promise me ... that you will call Dr. Thurman ? [ SOFTLY ] Okay . How 's it feel to have a wacko for a son ? It feels wonderful . Oh , here . I 'm sorry . Here you are . Oh . Hey , you guys are gonna win . I know it . SAMANTHA : So do I. Here 's the keys to the Taurus . There 's tons of food in the fridge . I left money on the kitchen table , and do not forget to ... Mom , go . You 're gonna miss your plane . Mom . I 'm just ... There 's nothing broken in my brain . I know . Bye , Donnie . Oh . Okay , go . Go . Go ! Bye . Hello , Donnie . It 's Friday . Shouldn 't you be off with your friends ... scaring old people ? What 's going on ? I don 't know . That 's a good question . Suffice to say , I 'm no longer your English teacher . They fired me . That 's bullshit . You 're the only good teacher here . Thank you ! What 's " cellar door " ? This famous linguist once said that ... of all the phrases in the English language ... of all the endless combinations of words ... in all of history ... that " cellar door " is the most beautiful . " Cellar door " ? I promise that one day ... everything 's going to be better for you . Chut up ! DR. THURMAN : I want to talk about your past today . DONNIE : No . DR. THURMAN : I want to talk about ... you and your parents . DONNIE : They didn 't buy me ... what I wanted for Christmas . What did you want for Christmas that year ? " Hungry , Hungry Hippos . " How did you feel ... being denied these " Hungry , Hungry Hippos " ? Regret . What else makes you feel regret ? That I did it again . You did it again ? I flooded my school ... and I burned down that pervert 's house . [ LAUGHING ] I only have a few days left before they catch me . Did Frank tell you to do these things ? I have to obey him . He saved my life . I have to obey him or I 'll be left all alone . And then ... And then I won 't be able to figure out ... what this is all about . I won 't be able to know his master plan . Do you mean , God 's master plan ? Do you now believe in God ? I have the power to build a time machine . How is that possible ? How is time travel possible ? Donnie ? Time 's up , Frank said . When is this going to happen ? Soon . Soon . What is going to happen ? Frank is going to kill . Who is he going to kill ? Who is he going to kill , Donnie ? I can see him right now ! The sky is going to open up . If the sky were to suddenly open up ... there would be no law . There would be no rule . There would only be you and your memories ... the choices you 've made ... and the people you 've touched . If this world were to end ... there would only be you ... and him ... and no one else . You can stop taking your medication . They 're placebos , just pills made out of water . Thank you . Donnie . An atheist is someone who denies altogether ... the existence of God . You 're an agnostic . An agnostic is someone ... who believes that there can be no proof ... of the existence of God but does not deny ... a possibility that God exists . Good-bye , Dr. Thurman . Hey . ELIZABETH : I got in . I 'm going to Harvard . Hey , we should totally throw a party . I mean , Mom and Dad are gone . It 's Halloween Carnival . We could totally get away with it . Okay , but it has to be small , all right ? [ SHOUTING , LAUGHTER ] [ CAR HORN HONKING ] [ DOORBELL CHIMING ] We got eggs , water balloons ... and a dozen rolls of toilet paper . I stole four beers from my dad . - Well , we got a keg . - Keg beer is for pussies . [ PHONE RINGING ] [ BEEP TONE ] Rose , this is Lilian Thurman . It is extremely important that you call me ... as soon as you get this message . Thank you . Hey . You okay ? Yeah , my mom 's gone . You want to come in ? Yeah . I don 't know , she ... She didn 't leave a note ... and the house was all messed up . But you 're okay ? Did you call the cops ? Yeah , they said I should leave the house ... and that I should go to a safe place . I 'm just so scared . I keep thinking something awful is happening , and ... It 's my fucking stepdad , I know it . I guess some people are just born with tragedy in their blood . Hey , have you guys seen Frank ? No , I think they were going on a beer run . - Shit . - [ PHONE RINGING ] [ BEEP TONE ] ROSE : If you 're there , please pick up . Oh , well . Good news . The girls , they got three and a half stars ... and they get to come back for the quarterfinals . Samantha was amazing . Anyway ... We 're going to take the red-eye back tonight , and we ought to arrive ... SAMANTHA : Mom , the plane 's about to leave . Okay . We 'll take the red-eye back tonight . We should arrive around 8 : 30 in the morning . I hope everything 's all right . I love you .

 Radio check . Perimeter is clear . Copy that . Give me a check every ten . Why don 't you folks make yourselves comfortable ? Watch some television . Get some rest . Try to put your minds at ease . Just try to stay away from the windows and the doors , if you would . Do we have to ask you if we can use the bathroom ? I feel like I 'm a prisoner in my own home . Ma 'am , I apologize for the imposition , but my job is to protect you . As of this evening , the FBI 's top priority is keeping you safe . For how long ? A week , a month ? Then what ? Jim , don 't do this , please . You don 't have to testify . It 's not worth it . These people have a long reach . They 're powerful . I have to do this . I 'm going to bed . Thank you . The grand jury convenes at 9 ; 00 . We 'll leave here at 7 ; 30 . I 'll be right outside the door if you need me . Jim ? Jim ? Are you feeling all right ? Jim ? [ Panting ] Mr. Skinner ! Mr. Skinner ! - Jim ! - Dr. Scobie ? - Jim ! - Ma 'am . [ Screaming ] Yes , at the time I was in another part of the house . Yes . Yes , sir . Yes , sir . Yes , sir , I will have answers for you . L ... I ... - Rough night ? - It 's shaping up to be a rougher morning . Follow me . There 's fingerprints everywhere , but as they all belong to the deceased ... and his wife , they don 't help us . - This is where the body was found ? - Yeah . What can you tell us about him ? Dr. James Scobie , age 44 , RD biochemist with Morley Tobacco . If he were alive as of 26 minutes ago , he 'd be giving testimony against his former employer before a federal grand jury . Testimony concerning what ? Not even his wife or his lawyer know the specifics . Only that it concerns research that he was involved in . Potentially extremely damaging to Morley . Enough so that Scobie received death threats . Given the high profile nature of the case , the director charged me with insuring Dr. Scobie 's protection . - And you think that someone made good on these threats ? - I do . Though we 've yet to determine how someone got in here or ... what killed him . [ Groans ] You can 't blow a whistle with a mouth like that . It 's almost as if his flesh has been stripped or eaten away . I mean , an assailant could have thrown acid on him . Well , if it was acid in the face , he would have screamed bloody murder . Well , we 're looking at all possibilities , Agent . We need answers . We don 't have a lot of time . And we 're going up against one of the biggest corporations in America . The director instructed me that he wants this case closed as swiftly as possible . I trust I can count on your help . All right , I want you to perform the autopsy . The body 's in the county morgue . - I 'll get right on it . - Thank you . - Huh . - What ? There 's no ashtrays . Dr. Scobie and his wife don 't smoke ? Not that I witnessed . Tobacco employee that doesn 't smoke . Isn 't that kind of like a GM executive who drives a Ford ? If this was a hit , it seems unnecessarily high profile . It kind of draws attention to itself , don 't you think ? That could be the point ... to intimidate potential witnesses . Scobie had a supervisor at Morley ... a Dr. Peter Voss . - I wanna talk to him . - You mind if I tag along ? - No . - [ Man ] Sir ? [ Skinner ] We 're here to see Dr. Voss . Do you have an appointment ? Do you have an appointment ? Maybe you missed this the first time around . Gentlemen , I can help you . Daniel Brimley , head of corporate security . A pleasure . Nice to meet you . - You 're here concerning Dr. Scobie 's death , I take it ? - We are . We were all extremely sorry to hear about it . Jim has a lot of friends in this building . Really ? No hard feelings that he was about to turn federal witness against your company ? Nobody was happy about Jim 's decision , but the timing of his death couldn 't have been worse . So you have no problem with us speaking to Dr. Voss ? Absolutely not . Whatever we can do to help . Please . Could you , um ... [ Clears Throat ] Could you give my sincerest condolences toJim 's wifeJoan ? How is she ? I 'm sure she 'll take comfort in fnding out why her husband died . Dr. Voss , can you enlighten us as to what Dr. Scobie intended to tell the grand jury ? We know it had to do with company research . I 'm sorry . Dr. Voss would be in violation ... of his employment confidentiality clause in answering that question . - Dr. Scobie was your friend ? - Yeah , for 14 years . And yet you demoted him five weeks ago . You took him off a particular project . Can you tell us why that happened ? As before , Dr. Voss would be in violation ... of his confdentiality clause in answering questions regarding the nature of his work ... here at Morley . I 'm sure you understand our cooperation cannot extend itself to revealing corporate secrets . I 'm not sensing any cooperation whatsoever . In fact , I 'm one more nonanswer away from getting ... a federal warrant and searching this entire building . - Then this meeting is over . Dr. Voss . - Dr. Voss . Can you tell me what that is ? - It 's a tobacco beetle . Why ? - I found it atJim Scobie 's house . Well , you 'll find a lot of these around here . They 're everywhere . There 's probably a dozen in the grill of your car right now . May I ask where you 're going with this , Agent ? I 'm sorry . I can 't . Answering that question would violate FBI confidentiality ... due to the sensitive nature of our investigation . [ Footsteps Approaching ] Evenin ' . - What are you doing here ? - I run out of smokes . Me and Dr. Scobie had an arrangement , as you know . So I figured , uh , Dr. Scobie not bein ' around , that my arrangement with him ... slides on over to you . Here ya go . That won 't hold me . I 'll bring you more . Just don 't come here anymore . All right ? It seems everybody 's actin ' funny around me all of a sudden , you know . Tellin ' me not to talk , to stay away from their houses . - Huh . - Too bad about Dr. Scobie . - Yeah . - I bet people are wondering how he died . I 've been working my own theory up in the old noggin . I 'd be happy to share it with you someday . I think that you should leave now . Yeah . I don 't wanna wear out my welcome . We 'll be seein ' a lot of each other , I expect . - Smoke ' em if you got ' em . - What have you found ? Well , the tissue damage on Dr. Scobie 's mouth extends ... all the way down his trachea into his lungs . His alveoli looked like corned beef . What about this being the result of some sort of corrosive agent ? No , that 's not the case . There 's no acids present , no caustics . This damage isn 't the result of any kind of chemical reaction . His airways have more or less just been reamed out . - I can tell you what killed him , strictly speaking . - What ? Hypoxemia : The inability to transfer oxygen ... from the lungs to the bloodstream . He choked to death ? All right . I mean , this damage , however it was accomplished , someone did do this to him . Well , not necessarily . There weren 't any signs of struggle in the room . - Maybe no one was ever there . - Where are you going with this ? Well , that this isn 't a homicide . You examined the body , Scully . Did you find any of these ? - A bug ? - It 's a tobacco beetle . I didn 't find anything like that , Mulder . Were you expecting me to ? Killer bugs ? This is what I 'm supposed to tell the director ? I don 't know , but judging from Dr. Voss 's reaction to this , I think it 's the thing we should investigate . [ Sighs ] [ Gunfre On TV ] I 've been tellin ' you all week . How many times I gotta say it ? No smoking ! You hear me ? America , man ! E Pluribus , uh ... I 'll get you kicked out , you son of a bitch ! You think I 'm kiddin ' ? I 'll do it ! The law 's on my side ! [ Body Thuds ] [ Man Screams ] Guests check in , but they don 't check out . Well , judging from the condition of the body , I 'd say that he died in the same manner as Dr. Scobie . Except this man 's no corporate whistle blower . Thomas Gastall . Out-of-date Massachusetts license , food coupons ... and a certificate of completion for a court-ordered anger management class . What could Morley Tobacco have against a transient from Massachusetts ? - Probably nothing . - What are you suggesting , Mulder ? ThatJim Scobie wasn 't murdered . Neither was this man . Well , then what killed them ? These . We didn 't find any insects in Dr. Scobie 's bathroom . But there was an open window through which they could have escaped . It 's a long shot , Mulder , but it could be some form of contagious agent , like an insect-borne bacterium , which would mean there might be other victims in this building . FBI . Sorry to wake you . No , you didn 't wake me . Come on in . Thank you . We 're investigating the death of the man who lived right next to you ... a Thomas Gastall . Do you know him ? I knew his voice . He yelled a lot . He yelled ? Yeah , he said I smoked too much . What are you gonna do , man ? It 's a free country . E Pluribus , uh ... - Do you mind ? - No . You don 't seem surprised that he 's dead . I guess his number come up . I 'm just glad it wasn 't me . - Well , what is your name , sir ? - Darryl Weaver . Mr. Weaver , did you see or hear anything unusual last night ? Little Korean fella down the hall dresses like Wonder Woman . - But that 's every night . [ Chuckling ] - Other than that ? There wouldn 't happen to be , uh , any reward money involved , would there ? I mean , I could use an extra buck or two . The FBI would appreciate your voluntary cooperation , sir . That 's the way it works . Ain 't that always the way . No , my mind is , uh , just drawing ' a complete blank . That 's my card . Thank you , Mr. Weaver . [ Door Opens ] Anything ? Two deaths in less than 24 hours and we 've yet to come up with an answer . And the only thing I have to go on medically at this point is Mulder 's bug . You know , I know an entomologist at UNC Willmington ... Dr. Libby Nance . Good . Talk to her . Where you going ? To see about something else that 's been bugging me . - Mrs. Voss ? - Yes ? Fox Mulder . Is your husband home ? - It 's okay , honey . It 'll just be a minute . - Sure thing . I really shouldn 't be talking to you without our lawyers . I understand your reluctance to talk , sir . You have a nice family , a lot to lose . What do you want , Agent Mulder ? There 's been another victim ... Thomas Gastall . Died exactly the same way Scobie did . I 'm sorry to hear that . But what 's that got to do with me ? Well , we found these all over him . I believe that that 's what killed both men . Tobacco beetle . It 's an herbivore . It eats tobacco . - Hence its name . - I understand that , but ... maybe these don 't . - I 'm not really required to talk to you , am I ? - No . But why are you hiding behind your lawyers , Doctor ? How many people have to die before you do the right thing ? - [ Phone Ringing ] - I 'll get it ! - Hello ? - [ Brimley ] What did he want ? - Are you spying on me ? - I 'm not spying on you , Peter . I 'm looking out for you . What did he want ? There 's been another death ... downtown . - How did it happen ? - I don 't know . I don 't know . This has gone on long enough . We should come forward . I should . Do you hear what you 're saying , Peter ? Now , I want you to just take a moment . I want you to think about what really matters to you . Now tell me where I can find Darryl Weaver . - Why ? - This was my mistake . I 'll clean it up . - I don 't know where he is . - [ Line Disconnects ] [ Woman ] This doesn 't make sense . What doesn 't make sense ? Well , it 's a Lasioderma serricorne ... a tobacco beetle . Only I 've never seen one exactly like this . Hmm . What are the differences ? Physical differences . Minor , but definitely notable . Deviations in the mandibles , the antennae , the body segmentation . What if such deviations arose from genetic engineering ? - Engineering the bugs themselves ? - No . I was actually thinking about another possibility ... transgenomics . - Which is ? - It 's a form of DNA manipulation ... alterations made on the genetic level . It is pretty widely known that tobacco companies have been pouring money ... into that kind of research . Changing the tobacco plant itself in order to make it heartier , give it less nicotine , more nicotine , make it naturally menthol flavored . - You name it . - A form of what ... super tobacco ? Which possibly could have created super bugs . I guess the real question is , could they have become dangerous to humans ? Mr. Weaver ! Mr. Weaver ! [ Weaver ] Sorry , Doc . No vacancy . - [ Chuckling ] - What happened there ? Well , you tell me . You 're the one with the PhD . I 'm just a big old guinea pig . Uh , listen . Um , you have to leave town . And give up all this ? Me not doin ' my part for science ? Here . Take it . It 's everything I have in the bank . Four thousand . It 's not much , but , uh , it 's a start . W-W-Wait a minute . I 'm not kidding . You gotta get out of here . Why ? I got a good thing goin ' here . I got cash money . I got all the coffin nails I can suck down . Although , lately , I 've been thinkin this particular brand , it doesn 't , uh , do anyone else any favors , health-wise . You thinkin ' that too , huh ? Would it bother you if I lit one up ? Toodles . No , you ... you don 't understand . Morley is a multibillion dollar global corporation . You think they 're gonna let you endanger that , huh ? They 'll kill you first . Well , it sounds like a Darryl Weaver problem to me . Yeah , uh ... What am I looking at ? [ Scully ] Thomas Gastall 's left lung and bronchus . Well , I guess that explains where the beetles came from . [ Footsteps Approaching ] Hey , Mulder . Where have you been ? Talking to lawyers over atJustice tryin ' to get a look at Morley 's files . Well , take a look at this . They 're the larval stage of the tobacco beetle , Mulder . And somehow they have ended up nesting in Thomas Gastall 's lungs . But what doesn 't make any sense is why Scobie 's lungs didn 't show this same condition . The larvae must pupate inside the lungs , and then once they mature into beetles , exit the body en masse . - That explains the condition of the face and throat . - [ Coughs ] Only how did they get into the lungs to begin with ? [ Coughing Continues ] Mulder ? [ Suction Whirring ] How is he ? They 're using a deep suction technique that 's been designed for asthma and cystic fibrosis . And so far , we 're having some luck at clearing his lungs . - But ? - For every one of those things that are in his lung tissue , there may be a dozen eggs that have yet to be hatched . - Eggs ? - His pulmonary tissue is riddled with them . And they 're going to hatch . It 's just , uh , we 're buying time . How did this happen ? These eggs , how 'd they get into his lungs ? I 'm thinking he inhaled them . Well , the tobacco beetle lives out its life cycle on or around the tobacco plant . That 's where it lays its eggs . If those genetically-altered beetles that we found did that , then maybe the eggs survived the processing into cigarettes . - And have been carried into Mulder 's lungs as smoke ? - Right . Like spores or pollen . Somehow small enough to be airborne . But Mulder isn 't a smoker . And neither was Scobie . Maybe they were around someone who was . Don 't bother calling security . Federal search warrant as promised . Do it . You 're gonna talk to me , Doctor . One of my agents is dying of the same thing that killed Dr. Scobie . I believe you have information that can save him . We stand by our contention that any information is proprietary ... and is therefore the sole property of Morley Tobacco . Listen to me , you son of a bitch . This isn 't about Morley or your precious research . This is about saving lives . - That 's exactly what we were trying to do . - Dr. Voss . I 'm advising you not to speak . This has gone on long enough . We thought we were doing a good thing . We knew people were never gonna stop smoking , no matter how unhealthy it was . So why not genetically engineer a safer cigarette ? Except you engineered the bugs as well . We recruited test smokers . We conducted focus groups . There were no problems . And , uh , after a few months in , things ... things got bad . We had four test subjects and , uh , three of them died . Is that what Dr. Scobie was gonna testify about ? Yeah . And the company wanted us to keep it quiet . I thought let 's correct the mistakes and face the consequences . Jim didn 't . He was monitoring the focus group , and that 's ... that 's how he got infected . You said only three died . Who was the fourth ? - Clear ! - Okay , go ahead . - Told me he meant to get Weaver . - Looks like Weaver got to him first . Mr. Brimley , can you hear me ? [ Gagging ] You got Mickey 's Big Mouth ? There 's no smoking in here . Mickey 's Big Mouth ? Anything else ? A carton of cigarettes ? You don 't have my brand . - [ Register Beeping ] - [ Police Radio Chatter , Indistinct ] Must be bad . How do you feel ? Like a Dustbuster attacked me . [ Coughing ] We 're looking for someone who may be able to help you . A Morley test subject by the name of Darryl Weaver . Mr. E Pluribus . Yeah . Well , Mr. Weaver seems to have some kind of tolerance or immunity , and we 're hoping that once we find him , we 'll be able to figure out how to treat you . [ Gasps ] Mulder ? [ Heart Monitor Beeping ] Doctor ! [ Gasping Continues ] [ Scully ] His sat 's down to 72 . Get some O2 on him and call the code . - Susan , code blue ! - [ Susan ] Right , Doctor . Over to my side ! Dr. Scully ? We 've got him stabilized on ECMO for the moment , but we 're not gonna be able to maintain him on it for long . Of course you see why . There 's more than there were six hours ago . They 're beginning to block the flow of blood . Our best bet is to go back in there . I think this time we have to crack the chest . No . No , uh , he 's too weak for thoracic surgery . He 'd die on the table . I don 't know what our other options are . I 'd say for the time being , we just wait . That 'll definitely kill him ... sooner or later . [ Knocking ] Mrs. Voss , I 'm Assistant Director Walter Skinner with the FBI . - May we come in ? - What is this ? What 's going on ? I have to ask for your cooperation . These men are here to protect you and your family . - Oh , my God . Why ? - Your husband hasn 't spoken to you about this ? - He 's not here . - He told me he was headed home . - Try Dr. Voss at work . - I 've just been trying . There 's no answer . Behind you . I was just leavin ' . I got what I came for . He took the test cigarettes . I couldn 't stop him . Stop right there ! Why ? You gonna shoot me ? I 'm not gonna let you go and infect more people . You 're gonna let me do whatever I wanna do . Dr. Voss here tells me you need me . You need me to save your boy . Don 't do it . They say these things kill people , you know . Any brand , sooner or later . But you know , it doesn 't have to be that way . I think Dr. Voss is really ... on to something with his research , I do . It 's over , Weaver . I 'm through . Oh . Come on , now . I mean , you gotta figure ... the first , uh , car ... killed a bunch of people ... before they perfected it , 'cause it 's all just part of the scientific process , you know . Mr. Weaver , I will shoot you . No , you won 't . I 'm a regular damn scientific marvel . They 're gonna study me . They 're gonna write scientific papers about me . I could be the cure for cancer . Me , Darryl Weaver . You ain 't gonna shoot me . Toodles . - [ Skinner ] How 's Mulder ? - Not good . Let 's get the blood work on this man . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Give me 30 milligrams of methyl-pyrrolidinyl-pyridine . - Nicotine ? - Yeah . I think this could save Mulder 's life . Hey . Good to be back ? - [ Hoarsely ] Beats the alternative . - Yeah . Well , you 'll be interested to know that Morley Tobacco has subpoenaed ... all of our files on the case . - They seem extremely interested in your recovery . - What about Darryl Weaver ? He 's , uh , well enough to have been moved to the hospital ward at Riley Correctional . It was the nicotine itself that was keeping him alive ? His fingertips were stained yellow with it . He was a four-pack a day smoker , far heavier than any of the focus group members who died . You know , nicotine is extremely poisonous . It 's actually one of the oldest known insecticides . It 's good for killing tobacco beetles . Well , once we loaded your system up with enough of it , it acted as a sort of chemotherapy . Except it almost stopped your breathing at the same time . That 's not all it did . I bought these on the way to work . You 're not gonna start smoking . Why not ? They say the addiction is stronger than heroin . Mulder . Good . Skinner 's waiting for us in his office . I 'll be right up . [ Child ] I made this !

 Wake up . Baby 's spotted two machines heading in fast . I see them . They 're runners . Think you can handle them ? Watch me . Okay . I 'm in . That runner 's smarter than we 've seen so far . - It 's quite a catch . - Thanks . Will it ... ? Do you think it 'll convert ? To convert is its choice to make . Do you think maybe we ought to reprogram it ? No . We can 't make slaves of them . Because that would be simpler . We won 't beat the machines by making them our slaves . Better to let them join us by choice . Make them believe the right choice is the one we want them to make . All right . Yes , machines are tools . They 're made to be used . - It 's their nature . - To be slaves . That 's why we can show them a better world , why they convert . - But that world we show them isn 't real . - It doesn 't matter . I 'm afraid they 'll figure out that we 've made up the thing in our heads . They can 't tell the difference . To an artificial mind , all reality is virtual . How do they know that the real world isn 't just another simulation ? How do you ? I know I 'm not dreaming now because I know what it 's like being in a dream . So dreaming lets you know reality exists . No . Just that my mind exists . I don 't know about the rest . Okay , he 's good to go . Looks like we are too . Dreaming already ? He 's had a rough day . You poor baby . Would you mind ? Not at all . Hello there . What 's happening ? Sentinels . Let 's go ! Come on , damn it , help me !

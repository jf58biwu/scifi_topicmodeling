 Previously on Farscape .. . Ka D 'Argo , your son is being sold in a lot of 10,000 slaves . Are we gonna rob a bank ? - Yes ! In one container is enough wealth to buy the entire shipment of slaves . Crichton ! Seal all exits ! Zhaan ! The doors are sealed , Aeryn ! What 's happening ? ! Scorpius must be on to us . They won 't get out . What the frell did you put in my head ? A tiny chip . A tiny seed that 's been growing in your brain . Scorpy , when he put me in his chair he did something , and it 's getting worse . We have done it ! We 've done it ! We are rich . As soon as we establish an exchange rate for these ingots , we 'll know exactly how rich we really are . ( screams ) They 're eating the ship ! Metalites . They consume metal . There are over 2,000 of those creatures on board . We could never kill them one by one like this . I can 't lose Jothee , not again . What do you want ? From you , nothing . But your father would give me something I want very much . Surrender to me . Or the boy dies . Item one , we need a Bloodtracker . Come with me . Item two , we 're gonna have to pound our way into the depository . For that , we need a Sheyang . Three , we need a Tavloid . You want the gauntlet , you take me with it . And finally , we need the Zenetan Pirates . ( yelling ) I liked your proposal . These guys are mercenaries . We get them , we go in hot , we kill Scorpius , and we bring your son back . You 'd burn Moya ? To save her . Pilot : No ! Scorpius is going to kill Jothee . Crichton : No , he won 't . Jothee , it 's really you ! You win . As if there was ever any doubt . And now , on Farscape . All right , Frankenstein . Let 's get it on . Get your property out of my head . It 's controlling you , isn 't it , John ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . In there . My neural clone . It forced you to me . Nothing forced me here . Annual checkups are essential to good health . You 're lying , John. I always know . Don 't worry . Soon , I 'll take the pain away . This thing in my head , this chip . Part of me now wants it to control me , so I 'm going to go to Scorpy and have him take it out before it 's too late . Before I no longer want it gone . Goodbye , my friends . At least by swapping myself for Jothee I can do you some good . You see how you misread him ? Yes . This doesn 't change anything . What 's not changed ? The plan . Why we brought you all here . Hey , nobody brought me . I volunteered . I am the Holy Warrior of Tarou . Whatever . All I 'm saying to the rest of you is that you were willing to go and save Jothee and instead , we 'll just go and rescue Crichton . Excuse me . You 're forgetting one thing . What ? We came on this adventure for one reason . You said you could pay us . That 's right . Well , that 's true ... Have you any currency now ? Well , um , we did have currency . Ah , well , what we thought was currency actually turned into , um , a creature . And it , ah , it ... it was alive , and ... we had to burn the ship . - Yes , yes , yes , I understand that , girl . But you see my problem , don 't you ? I don 't do anything unless I get paid . And since you no longer have currency ... Moya is now mine . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . A radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship , a living ship , full of strange alien life-forms . Help me . Listen , please . is there anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm being hunted by an insane military commander . I 'm doing everything I can . I 'm just looking for a way home . Go on , shoot her . You 're an embarrassment , Zelkin . Aeryn ! - You 're worse ... you 're worse than an embarrassment . You 're an idiot . What are you doing ? There are 30,000 containers in the Shadow Depository filled with riches that you could have but you 'd rather point a gun at a girl . What are you trying to do , Aeryn ? Shame me into going with you ? No . No , because even if you wanted to , I wouldn 't go into battle with you now . Do you know why ? Because you 're a coward and an idiot . What do you think you 're going to get if you steal Moya ? She 's a half burned Leviathan . I mean , you two have to be the stupidest pirates I 've ever met . We are not stupid ! Jothee : Hey ! What 's going on ? ! D 'Argo : You all stay where you are and remain calm ! Everybody , keep calm . See , Zelkin ? You don 't have the numbers . Get that gun out of my face ! I think this whole idea rots ! I want ... " l want ! I want ! " " My side ! Your side ! " All of you , " l want " ! What 's the matter with you , frekface ? Matter ? Matter ? I 'll tell you " matter . " Anti-matter , matter , matter , matter ! Oh , Scorpius killed 10,000 of my people ! 10,000 cast into space ! 10,000 souls scream in my brain . The chair ! The chair ! Remember the chair ? What chair ? ! This frekis crazy ! You coming ? Do you agree ? Agree ? Will you fight like this down there ? Of course , of course . No hands , no hands . Then I change my mind , Zelkin . ( Rorf growls ) This one has the spirit of the hunter and not the prey . But I want currency if I come and plenty of it . You 'll get it . You 'll all get it . So , are we agreed ? Are we going down to rescue Crichton ? Pilot : Aeryn ? D 'Argo ? Not now , Pilot . We 're negotiating . But there 's a ship approaching . is it Scorpius ? No , it 's it 's Talyn . Chiana : Talyn ? Natira : Scorpius , tell me something . Why are you so interested in this human ? There 's nothing impressive about the species . ( Crichton grunts ) Try not to move so much . One flinch at the wrong time and this will paralyze you . It 's kind of hard not to flinch here , Scorpy , with Frau Blücher tickling my prostate . What are you doing to him ? Why don 't you just take him and leave ? I must soften his neural receptors to see if my clone in his brain has reached the information I need . If I have , then I will call my Command Carrier back from battle and be away from you . See ? Flavius Scorpius here wants to visit foreign lands , meet foreign people and conquer them . You overestimate me , John . I have no desire to dominate the universe . But know this . The wormhole technology in your brain will sway the balance of power as we know it . Imagine , the ability to move an army in an instant . The power to make hostile planets disappear . ( low tone ) ( gasps ) Pilot : Crais , we are very thankful that you allowed Talyn to respond to her mother 's distress call . Eight entire tiers are burnt and Moya 's immune levels are falling to critical . Crais : The nutrients that Talyn 's supplying should start to heal Moya . Keep a check on the electrocell levels . They mustn 't rise above six parts . I 'm well aware of that . How much longer will Talyn remain linked to Moya ? Two arns . And then you 'll be leaving ? There 's little more that Talyn can do . is there some reason you wish us to stay ? We are planning to attack the Shadow Depository on the planet below us . And you want Talyn to help ? Scorpius is in the depository . Tempting . I thought that you didn 't want to use Talyn for violence . You all said that from the beginning . Yes , but this is different . How ? is this violence more acceptable because it 's for you ? No , it 's because Scorpius has captured Crichton and he 's going to kill him if we don 't get down there . There 's always a reason for violence , Aeryn . Thousands of people die for the most virtuous causes . You don 't have to lecture me , Crais . I believe I do . You 've lectured me countless times . How long has Scorpius held Crichton ? Four arns . Then I recommend you bring down a basket without any holes so that Crichton 's liquid remains are not lost . He 's already dead , Aeryn . Stark : And all the doors are cross-synchronized so when you 're here , I 'm here . And everything 's perfectly timed because we 're on a silent count , right ? Right ? Right ? ! You pay attention ! ( growls ) lf one piece of this plan fails then the entire plan fails . You got it ? You got it ? ! Look , all I understand is that I 'm going down first . With Bekhesh . Great . We 're going down , while you all stay up here out of danger . You 're the tracker . You must locate Crichton before we risk ourselves . ( growls ) What are you doing with that head ? He 's an old enemy. I like that he doesn 't talk back . ( snorts ) As soon as you locate Crichton , then the rest of us will follow straight down . And then Teurac and I will destroy their generator . How come I don 't get that job ? Because you can 't produce a fireball that burns at 7,000 klances . How will I know when to start burning the generator ? I told you ! We 'll all be on a silent count for the entire battle ! A-A silent count ? While we 're fighting ? Yes , it 's easy . It 's complicated . ( sighs ) What do they do ? Stark : The Zenetans will deploy the Flax . The Flix ? What the frell is the Flix ? The Flax is a net that will trap any ship coming after you . A net ? Oh , I see . They stay up here opening a net while I 'm down there risking my life ? ! What 's the point of a plan if you don 't get away at the end , pack animal ? D 'Argo : Do you know what that is ? No . What is it ? It 's , uh ... it 's your blood ancestor 's Qualta Blade . My father 's father used it in the Siege of Repmek . You 're kidding me ? You fought with this ? It weighs a drackik . It 's perfectly balanced . I still use it myself . I 'm , uh ... I 'm sorry that we haven 't spoken . Don 't be sorry . I don 't know what to say either . Who did this to you ? Who mutilated you ? You did . In a way , you 've done everything that ever happened to me . Jothee ... Son ... I had to send you away . After your uncle accused me of killing your mother ... I 'm not angry with you . But what 's going on in this ship ... you don 't expect me to help you save Crichton , do you ? I thought you would want to . Listen ! I 'm interested in saving myself . For ten cycles I 've been running , trying to survive . I realize that. I want to know everything that has happened to you in your life ... No , no ! You don 't want to know ! Believe me you don 't want to know . I have done things , many things I 'm not proud of to survive . Now ... I ... I don 't want to shame you , but I am not going back to that planet . I only just got my freedom back . I 'm not going to risk losing it again . There . He 's ready now . Oh , don 't stop now , Scorpy . Roll me over and baste the other side . Are you going to take out the implant ? No . I 'm going in . ( low tone ) ( gasps ) What the hell ? This is Sawyer 's Mill . My dad used to bring me fishing here when I was a kid . This is a place inside your memory , John . A place in your brain . In my brain ? Yes . We 're inside your brain , and no , I 'm not Scorpius . But he is . Hello , John . Have you obtained the wormhole information ? I believe I 've burrowed far enough . The information was well hidden by the Ancients . I suspect even Crichton is unaware of the specifics . is he ready to have the chip removed ? Oh , yes . I 'll call my Command Carrier . When we reach my ship and I remove my neural clone , your death will be painless . Screw this . ( grunts loudly ) I can 't move . God , I can 't move . I 'm sorry Aeryn . You 're wasting your time if you came here to beg . Not begging . Choose your own word . Look , Crais , we 're all going to die if you don 't help us . Will other lives be lost in this attack ? You can have anything you want . Anything . Aeryn Sun ... are you ... offering yourself ? Crichton , if he 's alive , must mean a great deal to you . You can take what you want and I won 't stop you . I don 't want you to think I 'm a coward . I don 't . I 've been thinking about what you said earlier . I was wrong to ask you to join us in battle . It 's not your fight . No , Father . If it 's your fight then it 's mine , too . Thank you . Ka D 'Argo . We need to talk . About the plan . Not again . Pilot , would you mind telling these fools what we talked about earlier ? D 'argo advised me to auto-program the Maintenance Bay . If you try to mutiny , the chamber will fill with benon gas and render you unconscious . We have no desire to die , Ka D 'argo . But you are a warrior . You must admit , this plan seems , uh ... flawed . It 's more than flawed . It 's frelled . And that is why I say we should forget about it . Forget it ? You think they 're just going to let us walk in down there ? Pilot , is Moya well enough to do us one more favor ? What kind of favor ? A low-level maneuver through atmosphere . I think she might be able to manage it once . I 'll ask her . This is what I think we should do . Moya should prove a distraction . Then we go down there , burst through the front doors and storm the place . It 's what we do best . Are you ready to go down now , and save Crichton ? But we all heard his transmission . What if Crichton 's worse and won 't be rescued ? Well , that 's easy . I put a bullet in Crichton 's head and end it . The Command Carrier is arriving six arns earlier than expected , sir . Well , that 's too bad . I thought you wanted to leave as soon as possible . I do , but , uh ... good news . I 'm always suspicious of good news . Hey , Scorpy , why don 't you cut me down ? Isn 't torture time over ? I don 't torture people , John . You misunderstand me . Now that my neural clone has reached the information that I need , I 'll remove it . As soon as my Command Carrier arrives . It seems ... ( groans ) Crichton : Oh , what 's the matter ? Got a little warm head ? How about I change that rod for ya ? I got some spares . Natira , lock this chamber down . Open it for no one but me . I 'll do it . Human , you are surprising . I 've never seen Scorpius worry about anyone as much as you . Don 't be jealous , Frau Blücher . He only loves me for my mind . You know , you should come in and visit some time . Why would I ever want to go inside you ? So the Scorpius in my head can tell you exactly how he 's going to kill you . Well , I can tell you , you 're about to taste blood . ( gagging ) Was that good for you ? Yes . Rorf : Moya ? Anyone ? How does this frellingthing work ? Rygel : I hear you , Bloodtracker . We 're just outside the depository and yes , you were right . The guards aren 't looking for a Vocarian or a Tavlek . Can you smell Crichton ? No , but ... Why not ? Well , it 's just ... The problem is he 's a lousy tracker . It seems smelling is a female 's job . Oh , frell ! I don 't want to hear excuses . Just find Crichton . You 're no help , Bekhesh ! Why don 't you frell off ? Hmm ? I would 've found him by now if it wasn 't for you clumping around behind me . Fine . From now on , you 're on your own . ( snorts ) ( puffing ) ( wheezing and puffing ) What 's the matter , Teurac ? Uh , nothing . Can you produce flame ? Of course . I will not let you endanger the rest of us . Stark 's plan depends upon your ability to produce flame . If you cannot , I must warn the others . No ! I still have flame nutrients , but can no longer tap into them . Unless ... Unless what ? If you have Taakarserum ... But that 's poison . Pilot . Pilot ! Answer this frellingthing , will you ? Ah , I 'm sorry , Rorf . I 've been training all my sensors on healing Moya . I got through the waste vents and Crichton 's on the level above the main chamber . He 's ... ( snarling ) Rorf ? Rorf ? I told you . I don 't know this human . Scorpius : Bounty hunter . Why are you here ? Well , I was planning to make a deposit . ( laughing ) A deposit of what ? Fur lice ? Natira : Akkor . Back away and shut up . I 'm just doing ... Back away now . Bounty hunter . This is the last time I will ask . What are you doing here ? Get frelled . You know what I was doing . I was casing the joint for Zenetan pirates . I didn 't know you were here , and I don 't know who he is . Zenetan Pirates . Please , allow me to question the animal . Sometimes a female 's touch ... You should have answered me . ( snarling ) I was trying to save you . Animal , you have lovely eyes . I love red eyes . Very sensual . Very unusual . Animal , what are you doing here ? I told you ... Do not lie again . Who were you communicating to ? And what is the plan to free the human ? A plan ? I don 't know of any plan . Animal , I love your eyes so much . Your lying eyes . ( Rorf screaming ) ( howling in pain ) That 's all I know . They plan to destroy the generator then attack in the darkness . Darkness is the key . Please don 't take my other eye . ( whimpering ) Natira , my senses tell me that this animal is telling the truth . Braca , come with me . If we secure the generator their plan will fail . We have to be fast . Once we land on the planet Moya 's going to run a distraction . Teurac , Zhaan and Stark , I want you to go through the waste vents , into the depository and destroy the generators . Aeryn and I will meet up with Bekhesh . Once the power is gone we 'll be able to storm through the center chamber doors and rescue Crichton . What about me ? I thought I was going too . You 're going to stay here on the Transport Pod with Rygel . I said I 'd go . That 's why I 'm here . - Look , it is not your fight . I 've lost you once before . I 'm not going to lose you again . Braca , while I secure the generator , get to the monitor and be my eyes and ears . Yes , sir . Tell me . is there a back way to the generator ? Yes . Pilot , we 'll be touching down on the planet in 30 microts . Pilot : Good luck , Aeryn . Good luck to you all . Thank you , Pilot . Rygel , I 'm handing control over to you ... now . Let 's do it . Starting descent ... now . Chiana , tell the Zenetans to prepare for a low level maneuver . You got it , Pilot . Blue Eyes . Look out at that . That is the last sight your eyes will ever see . You are a sick puppy . Scorpius has to kill me , and you 're still getting your jollies . Oh , he doesn 't ... he doesn 't have to kill you , Blue Eyes . What ? He ... He can get the chip out without hurting me ? Oh , yes . First red , now blue . Scorpius wants your brain . He said nothing about your eyes . Blue eyes ... So soft ... Very rare ... ( explosions ) What the frell is that ? That 's Moya . ( exultant cry ) You 're clear to land , Rygel . Get in there now . Sir , we have a problem . Now ! Bekhesh , take out the camera . Scorpius : Mobilize every available soldier . Have them stand by outside the main chamber . Oh , dear , dear , dear . What has Moya done here ? You are so screwed , Medusa ! I 'll tell you what . You get me out of here , I 'll help you stay alive . Why do you want to escape now , human ? You just told me that I could get the chip out of my head without dying ! When you get me out of here , I 'll give you the damn chip . Hell , you can have the wormhole technology . As a bonus , you can have one of my eyes . Let us go , you bitch ! ( yelling ) The generator 's this way . Quick . Teurac , that 's the generator . Burn it ! Give me the Taakarserum . Give it to me now . Are you sure ? It 's seven units . It 's a lethal dose . Not for us . Younger Sheyangs have survived nine . Give it to me ! There is no other way . We have to get that frelling gun . Okay . ( grunts ) ( empty click ) Good shot . I was aiming for between his eyes . Teurac , what 's taking so long ? You have to destroy the generator now . I 'm trying . My chest ... the fuel is there , but I can 't reach it . You must hurry . They 'll be here soon . Scorpius : I 'm here already , Zhaan . Guards : Hold it there . Don 't resist . Put the weapon down . Put the weapon down now ! Why hasn 't the power gone off ? It 's that frellingSheyang . He couldn 't do it . I knew I shouldn 't have trusted him . Do you think there 's anyone on the other side of this door ? Are we going to do this or not ? I don 't know if we have any other choice . None whatsoever . Natira . Natira , why aren 't you answering me ? Scorpius ! Don 't worry about her . Worry about me . Shoot him . - No . No , don 't . He 's a Sheyang . That 's right . I 'll explode if you shoot me . Goodbye , Zhaan . This is not your fault . I always knew it had to end like this . Teurac ! ( screaming ) - No ! ( power shutting down ) They did it . They killed the power . You two go to night vision . I can 't see . Mine 's not working . Just shoot ! Wait . I think I did it . My night visions are finally working . ( powering up ) For someone who couldn 't see , you did okay . ( screaming ) Braca ... Braca , can you see Crichton ? No , the monitor 's gone dead . Then get me some emergency power now ! Natira ? Natira , I know you 're listening . If you 're betraying me , if anything happens to Crichton ... Come on , Natira , you 'd better make up your mind quick ! Scorpius : Answer me . - Scorpy 's gonna kill you no matter what happens here . You don 't believe me ? Go in my head and ask the clone how you 're gonna die . Ask him ! Natira , ask him . Where is he ? I 'm here , Natira . Tell me ... Scorpius would never harm me , would he ? Now I know why Scorpius found you so ... enticing . To possess a beauty like you ... To feel ... all of this . Crichton 's right . Scorpius is going to kill me . Oh , my lovely , how fortunate you are . Your death will be painless . Natira , come get this spike out of my neck . Forget about him . If I take it out will you get me on Moya and away from Scorpius ? Do we have a deal ? Where is Crichton ? You said he was here ! This is where Rorf said he would be . They must have moved him . Obviously . There 's a way out on the lower level . We must move faster . What 's the matter , Crichton ? I can 't get Scorpius out of my head and he 's not gonna let me go ! Don 't push him , bitch ! Just stop it ! - Don 't tell me to stop it . She took out my eye ! Peacekeepers ! We 're on our way to the pickup point , Rygel . Come and get us now . On our way , Zhaan . Out of the way , you slug. I 'm gonna ... intruders in the landing bay . Get a squadron up there now . Braca . Braca , signal the Zenetan Pirates . Zelkin , deploy the Flax . I repeat , deploy the Flax . - Zelkin , who you speaking to ? is that a Comm ? Hey , easy , easy girl . Oh , I didn 't know you cared . Kurz , release the Flax . ( screaming ) Why the frell aren 't we moving ? It 's the Flax . We 're trapped . Neural clone : You 'll never get away from me , John . - Let ... go ! Go away . You 're not real . Neural clone : You 'll never get away from me , John . Go away Scorpius ! Move it ! Scorpius ! Don 't shoot Crichton. I need him alive . Crichton , get back ! There 's no escape , John . No escape , John . No ! ( yelling ) ( growling ) ( yelling ) Let 's go ! We have a deal , Crichton . Rorg ! Leave him , John . Natira : Come on ! Rorf : Go ! Go ! Leave him , and come to me . Crichton ! ( yelling ) Take me to Moya . Frell you , Crichton ? Die alone . Rorf ! My female ! My female ! D 'Argo , you must go back to her . You must tell her ... - l will. I will . They 're coming from both sides . We 're trapped . Rygel ? Rygel ? ( yelling ) Why aren 't you here ? Rygel ! Zhaan. ls that you , Zhaan ? Crais ? Has Talyn returned ? Sorry about this , but Scorpius will kill me if I don 't hold Moya for him . We 're free , Chiana ! The Flax has gone . Kurz ? Kurz , what 's happening ? Kurz ? Kurz is dead . Talyn has destroyed your ship . I 'll take Moya then . You 're not taking anything . Oh , what a waste . Crais : Aeryn ? Crais . Talyn has just destroyed the Zenetan ship . Have you come back to help us ? Let 's just say that I 'm here . All right . Hang on a microt . Stark , Zhaan ? Yes , Aeryn , we 're here . Can you remember from the blueprints what runs parallel to the internal corridors ? I think there are reverse pressurization chambers . Where do they lead ? To the depository . Perfect . Rygel ? Yes ? Pick up Zhaan and Stark in the waste vents , and come and get us when Talyn 's finished . Finished with what ? Don 't ask . Crais , target off my Comms , and destroy the depository . Talyn 's firepower is massive , Aeryn . How will you survive the damage ? We 'll be safe . Just give us 90 microts and obviously , try not to hit my signal with a direct strike . Neural clone : Crichton , you want the chip gone ? All right , follow me . Follow you where ? - Here . You want the pain gone ? Come to me . Go down to the depository . Hide in a container . That should protect us from Talyn 's attack . Should ? - Have you got a better idea ? Well ... Aeryn , I 'm , uh ... I 'm going to go to Scorpius . Frell you are . D 'Argo ... carry him ! It 's what Aeryn wants us to do , Pilot . Destroy the entire building . This way ! It 's frelling locked ! They 're in the depositing room . Zhaan , I think we 've got company . Rygel ! Rygel ! Almost there , Zhaan . Move . Right ! into the container . I didn 't plan on becoming a deposit . Rygel : Touching down now , Zhaan . Let 's go ! Come on ! Talyn firing in 20 microts . Locking on now . Talyn firing in 15 microts . All right , they 're in ! Let 's go ! Go ! Go ! Move ! Move ! Move ! Wait for my signal . In ! Ten microts . Nine ... Eight ... Seven ... Six ... Five ... Four ... Three ... Two ... One . Fire . Mine , mine , mine . ( laughing ) Can I have this ? Can this be mine ? We can all have anything we want now , right ? Any food , any female , anything ? Right ? Right ! Yeah . Oh , don 't be like them . You 're like me , Chiana . We did it ! This is not like before . This won 't eat the ship . So cheer up . We got Crichton back and Aeryn and D 'Argo and Jothee , and we 're rich . Perfect . Yes , but Moya is still extremely ill . Pilot says that she may never fully recover . And Rorf and Teurac lost their lives . So ? They knew the risks . Don 't worry about Rorf and Teurac . On my oath , I will deliver their shares to their families . Farewell , my friends . And thank you for teaching me to kill again . I have to thank you , Crais . If you hadn 't of returned , we all would be dead . As much as I 'd like to take credit for it , I did nothing . Your attack saved us . I had little control . Talyn came to free Moya himself . You didn 't command him ? No . He acted alone . As much as any of us may want , he has the instincts of a warrior and does exactly as he pleases . How is Crichton ? ( softly singing ) : Daisy , Daisy .. . John ... I 've brought my son Jothee - Give me your answer true .. . to thank you . - l 'm half crazy .. . John ? - all for the love of you .. . Neural clone : John , John , John .. .. John , John , John .. . - Shhh ! He 's here , um ... He 's here and , um ... he blames me . He blames me for killing Scorpius . So , I 've been ... I 've been trying to ... but I can 't ... Do what ? Do what , John ? D 'Argo , kill me . D 'Argo , please . Kill me .

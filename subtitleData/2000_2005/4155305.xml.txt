 DR. NEWMAN : Easy . Diazepam , 5 milligrams . Uh-huh . [ Door opens ] Easy , now , Mr. Cable . You 're gonna be fine . Just having a nightmare . Let it go , Mr. Cable . Whatever it is , you just have to let it go . Where am I ? You 're in a hospital . St. Jude 's . I 'm Dr. Jeremy Newman . I 've been assigned your case . You were admitted last night . Don 't you remember ? That 's okay . Perfectly normal after that kind of trauma . What happened ? Paramedics were called just after midnight . They found you right in front of your house . You had violent choleric abdominal convulsions . I 'm afraid we had to evacuate your stomach contents . And ? It 's just ... I apologize . I 've never had to tell a patient this before . We 're a small hospital and painfully short-staffed . I 'm actually a pediatric doctor by training , so any bad news I have to give usually involves a lollipop . Would you like one ? It 's grape . Doctor . Please . You died , Mr. Cable . Your heart stopped beating for nearly two minutes . No , no , it 's all right . We resuscitated you . We brought you back . You 're good as new . Well , practically . So that 's why I 'm here . Over the next few days , we 'll run a series of tests . My name is Simon Cable . I was born July 4 , 1 9 7 4 . My parents were Catherine and Leonard . My father owned a publishing company . My mother ran charities . I have one older brother . Peter . You can ask me anything . I 'm fine . That 's the spirit . This won 't take long . Okay , so . Do you remember my name ? Dr. Newman . Justin . Jeremy . That 's okay . Nobody here remembers it anyway . And the date ? It 's the ... the ... Wait a minute . Have I missed a day ? No . It 's Friday . Then it 's ... God , I 've always been terrible with dates . Well , that 's okay . Don 't worry about it . How about the month ? What month do you think it is ? It 's ... summer . Maybe . How about the year ? Last year was ' 99 , so this year is 2000 . It 's the year 2000 . Right ? Your wife 's name ? Simon . This is the 29th of July . The year is 2002 . And your wife , whose name is Anna , is waiting outside . Back that truck up now ! Get these cars out of here ! WOMAN : We 're gonna need some backup here ! Hey ! You all right ? ! You okay ? ! Take it easy , man . I 'm gonna take you on a little trip . You okay ? Just hang in there , now . Won 't be long . [ Siren wailing ] MAN : What do we got ? WOMAN : We got two . There 's one en route . Let 's move on . Saline to stabilize the heart . Watch your backs ! B.P. dropping . Coming through . Man coming through . His name is Simon Cable . [ Heart monitor beeping ] One , two , three . [ Grunts ] The time is 2000 hours . - [ Flatline ] - He 's crashed . He 's crashed . Get the defib . Start chest compression . One , two , three , four , five . One , two , three , four , five . One , two , three , four , five . One , two , three , four , five . One , two , three , four , five . One , two , three , four , five . No pulse ! Gonna flatline . Get someone from surgery down here . Paddles . 1 00 . Charging ! Clear ! No change . 200 . - Charging ! - Clear ! There 's nothing to explain , Dr. Newman . His synoptic cholinesterase is practically nonexistent . DR. NEWMAN : I don 't want to be discussing this now . What I need is coffee . Poisonings of a suspicious nature have to be reported to the police . That 's hospital policy . Let 's rule everything out first . That 's all I 'm saying . DR. NEWMAN : Diazepam , 5 milligrams . Take it easy , Mr. Cable . You 're gonna be fine . Just having a nightmare . Let it go , Mr. Cable . Whatever it is , you have to let it go . So , what we 're looking at here is anterior-grade amnesia . Basically short-term memory loss . Nothing to get too worried about . Nothing to get too worried about ? These episodes usually sort themselves out in a couple of days , couple of weeks . You 're telling me that I lost two years of my life ? Think of it as if your life 's a puzzle that 's been jumbled up . All the pieces are still there . We just have to put them back together . Fit them in the right order and place . And honestly , Simon , I love a good puzzle . And I have a wife . Yeah . These situations are tough on couples . But your wife will help us with this . She could be the key . So , if you 're feeling up to it , I 'll go and get her . What do you think , Simon ? Would you like me to get your wife ? Simon . God . Simon . I was so scared . I called every hospital . I didn 't sleep at all . Give me a break , huh ? The doctor says I 'll be just fine . Oh , my God . What happened to you ? You have no idea how scared I was . For a moment , I felt what it would be like if you weren 't in my life . I just completely lost it . You know , it was kind of pathetic . What 's the matter ? Are you hurting ? Dr. Newman hasn 't told you what 's happened to me , has he ? Okay , now you 're freaking me out , Si . I lost my memory . I can 't remember anything about the past two years . I don 't even know how I got here last night . And I don 't know who you are . What are you doing , Simon ? Telling you the truth . I 'm sorry . I don 't know you at all . You 're serious . With everything that 's happened , this is how you 're gonna tell me ? Wait a second . I don 't think you understand . Are you crazy , Simon ? I don 't know what happened . I have nothing left . Wait ! Please ! Anna ! Anna ! Whoa , Mr. Cable . Whoa , whoa , stop . Stop her . - Stop who ? - My wife . - Man , there 's no one there . - What are you talking about ? No aerobics for at least a week . Dr. Newman , will you please stop my wife ? Stop her ? She 's not going anywhere . You have to tell her what 's happened . - l have , Simon . - No , you haven 't . ANNA : Yes , he has , Simon . Thank God you 're okay . The kids I work with can 't get enough of these . I love watching their eyes light up when they finally put it all together . It 's just amazing . Anyway , in order to recover what you 've lost , Simon , we need to find ... two points in time ... and ... join them . So , let 's begin with the last memory you can recall two years ago . Can you ... tell us what happened last night ? I wasn 't with you last night . He has no memory of any of it . Your role , Anna , will be to help him put his life back together . Our life . It was our life . Of course . Last night I was at home . You were up here . I don 't know what happened . Peter . I must 've been visiting Peter . Peter ? Peter 's my brother . We ... He lives up here . He moved into our parents estate after my mom died . We don 't really get along , but ... That 's the only reason I 'd be up here . Right ? Simon , honey . Peter 's dead . What ? Peter died before we met . There 's no fucking way . I was ... I was going to see him just last night . You didn 't see Peter last night . He means his last night . The last night he can remember . There was rain . And this light . Then everything 's quiet . [ Exhales sharply ] No rain . And no light , just ... Oh , gosh , he 's talking about the car accident . [ Voice breaking ] Just this empty void . And I 'm lost in it . It happened right before we met , Simon . I don 't know that much . Just that you were up here to see Peter . I don 't even know why . You never used to like to talk about your brother . There was a fight over their father 's estate . Maybe you read about it . Anyway , after the accident , this was the hospital you were taken to . Wait a minute . I was here before ? I really need a cigarette . So , we have our two moments , Simon . Both were accidents . Both led you to St. Jude 's . I can 't remember . It doesn 't make sense . None of this makes any fucking sense . Two days ago , you came up here to close up your parents ' house . It 's been sitting here for two years , ever since ... Anyway , you finally agreed to let it go . You were gonna pack up the furniture , fix some of the fixtures , finish the old staircase , and ... Refinishing ? Interesting . Really , it 's a gorgeous place , but it 's falling apart . No , no . What I mean is ... Well , one or two of Simon 's enzyme counts are lower than normal . But I thought you said I was okay . I said , " practically , " kid . But your low enzymes are an indication that somehow your bloodstream was poisoned . You 're saying someone tried to poison him ? I 'm not trying to say anything . But it 's highly possible that your condition was caused by fumes from certain cleaning solutions or varnishes trapped in an enclosed space . So , now what ? Well , you 'll be fine . We 've got you on atropine . And we 'll reactivate your cholinesterase with one of the doximes . The sooner you can eat something , the better . I 've scheduled an mri to make sure everything 's A-okay . So , if you 'll excuse me , I 'm sure you 've seen enough of me to last you a lifetime . I 'll check back with you in a few . Anna ? You can drop the pretense now , you smug fuck . My God , I knew you were a good liar , but this performance is unbelievable . Okay . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Then I 'd pay closer attention . Don 't think you 're gonna win this game because I am a much better player than you are . This is about her , isn 't it ? Do you think I 'm that blind ? is she really worth this ? All of it ? Who are you talking about ? ! I 'm talking about you . Rich , little daddy 's boy in way over his head . This would actually be sad if you weren 't so pathetic . Wait . You said Peter was dead . Of course he 's dead . You killed him . Knock , knock . Mr. Cable , it 's time for your mri . What happened ? Ask him . Sleep well , honey . You ! Hey ! Come on , homeboy , I 'm gonna take you on a little trip . This isn 't happening . Man , I didn 't think you could get any whiter , but you look like you 've seen a ghost . Let 's roll . You have to lie here . So , what makes someone want to kill a nice , all-American dude like you ? What ? Who said - - What ? Relax , man . It 's just a rumor . Everyone talks about everything around here , especially Nurse Clayton . Arms down , please . Nobody was trying to kill me . It was just the chemical l was using on the stairs . Right , yeah . The fumes must 've got to you . Keep your head still . Anyway , my point 's this . Everybody dies . No mystery there . But why and how everyone dies . Now , there 's a mystery worth solving . Probably the biggest mystery there is . Man , you 're not making any sense . Hey , I 'm not the one who can 't remember what year it is . What 's your name ? Travis . - Straps too tight ? - Travis . Are you going out of your way to make me nervous ? If I wanted to scare you , I 'd tell you about the number of tumors these machines cause . You hang tight , now . I don 't want to be around when this starts leaking . I mean , scanning . Dr. Newman will be right along . See you later . Thanks , Travis . Hey ! You in there . Fuck . [ Door opens ] Who is it ? [ Lock locking ] Dr. Newman ? I know this sounds ridiculous , but I got this terrible itch in my nose . Who is that ? Hey , I don 't suppose you can unstrap me . Hello ? Hello ? What are you doing ? My name is Simon Cable . You want to check the chart or something ? I don 't think I need that ! Get off me . Get the fuck off me ! Somebody ! Somebody help me ! Somebody help me ! - [ Alarm blaring ] - MR . TRAVlTT : Sweet Jesus . What the hell just happened ? What ? Are you some kind of a lunatic or something ? Who 's that ? This is a hospital , pal , not a nuthouse . Oh , Doc , glad you could make it . We got a live one here . - How did I just get here ? - You shouldn 't be up . - Not yet . - Who are you ? Someone just tried to kill me . - Yeah , Wacko . - Mr . Travitt , enough . Just giving him some positive reinforcement , Doc . This is St. Jude 's Hospital . Do you know why you 're here ? I was just in the mri room . No , Mr. Cable , you were admitted into this room last night . Now , do you know why you 're here ? I wasn 't in this room last night . I was alone in a private room . No offense taken . Mr. Cable , look at me . All I want you to do is to answer my one question . Do you know why you are in St. Jude 's Hospital ? Yes , because of the staircase . - l just need to talk to my wife . - Your wife ? Just find Dr. Newman . He 'll know where she is . We don 't have a Dr. Newman on our staff , Mr. Cable . Now , if you don 't calm - - What do you mean you don 't have a Dr. Newman ? I was with him all last night . The doctor who was here today , a pediatrician . I talked to him for about a half hour . Listen to me . You have been unconscious since your car accident . No , it wasn 't an accident . It was poisoning . You must not have been on duty . You have been involved in a serious road accident . And the trauma has obviously affected your memory . - A car accident ? - Yeah . And you 're lucky to be alive , actually . Last night ? Yeah . That 's impossible . [ Door opens ] Swell going , Doc . Calmed him right down . What are you running away from , Mr. Cable ? What were you hoping to find ? Your mind 's playing tricks on you , Mr. Cable , that 's all . There was no poison ? No , I 'm sorry . And there is no Dr. Newman on the staff at this hospital . Look , you 've been unconscious , so the oxygen supply - throughout your system - - - What 's the date ? What ? The date today ? July 29th . Why ? And the year ? - The year ? - Yeah , what year is it ? 2000 . So , you 're telling me that it 's the year 2000 , and I 've just been in a car accident , that I wasn 't poisoned , and there is no Dr. Newman ? Yeah , that 's right . What about my wife ? - Your wife ? - Yeah , my wife . Actually , your admission papers have you down as being single . Okay . I 've just spent the entire day wandering this hospital , talking to a Dr. Newman , my wife , a mystery woman , an orderly named Travis . Now you want me to believe none of this happened ? You want a cup of coffee ? I 'm not crazy . I can 't be . I don 't doubt you believe what you believe , Mr. Cable . The mind is a remarkable thing . Perhaps your mind is showing you something you need to see . Oh , so being poisoned and nearly murdered . This is what I need to see ? It 's not for me to say . I have been in this hospital before , but two years from now . This is not my mind playing tricks on me . This happened . And this is where you met a Dr. Newman and an orderly named Travis ? Yes . Will meet . You know , it 's possible you could be suffering from a preoccupied delusion , Mr. Cable . - lt wasn 't a delusion . - Just consider . While you were unconscious , you fabricated this story , then stored it deep within your memory banks , so that now awake , when you look back on it , it appears as real as any true memory . It was as real as these walls or you . Even when you 're unconscious , your senses are alive . You have overheard things and then incorporated them into your delusion . You said , " Travis . " The patient in your room is Travitt . You met a Dr. Newman . I 'm Truman . It 's like in a dream . You think you 've heard a siren , and then when you awake , you realize it 's only your alarm . Hey , Wacko , you know , I 've been thinking . I swear I know you . I mean , well , are you anybody ? Been in the papers ? What about Anna ? is she also just part of the dream ? Yes , Mr. Cable . I would venture that she is . I just want to remember . I have to . Sorry to interrupt , Doctor . I wanted to bring in one of my nursing students to check Mr. Hanad 's vitals , if that 's okay . That 's fine , Nurse Clayton . Go right ahead . Okay , what the hell is she doing here ? That 's just Nurse Clayton . But she was in my dream . Mine , too . What 's she wearing in yours ? ANNA : How are you today ? That 's - - But you said - - What ? What is it ? She 's my wife . Anna ? Yes ? Anna , have you been in this room in the past 2 4 hours ? No . is everything okay , Doctor ? Mr. Cable , I need you to get into bed right now . How could I know her name ? How could I ? I know who - - l got it . You 're the son of that dead rich guy , aren 't you ? You 're all in on this . You 're all out of your fucking minds . I know I was here . I was in this goddamn room . Anna , tell him you know me . Largactil . 1 0 . Tell him you know me ! Mr. Cable , just come and sit down . It wasn 't a dream . That was real , and this isn 't . - This is an illusion . - Just relax . What are you doing ? - Doctor . - Thank you , Nurse . - Now , this is for your own good . - No ! - Just sit down . - No , please ! - That 's it . - l 'm telling you ! You 're not real ! Who 's there ? What do you want ? [ Breathing heavily ] What do you want ? Get away from me ! Doctor ! Doctor ! Doctor ! Doctor ! Take it easy , Simon . He 's behind the door . He 's behind that goddamn door ! - Keep your head still . - You 're not listening . There 's someone behind that door . Please ! He 's right there ! 5 mills , diazepam . No ! No ! [ Whimpers ] [ Breathing heavily ] Simon , listen very carefully to what I 'm saying . You 've been prescribed a drug that 's known to have mild psychiatric side effects . There is no one in the hospital that 's gonna kill you . There is no one behind the door . Well , if you 're so sure , look . Simon , please . Look behind the fucking door ! Okay . I know . Just look behind the door , not to see if there is someone there , but to prove to me that there isn 't someone there . - This will relax you . - [ Pager beeping ] " C " Ward . I 'll join you there in a minute . Don 't leave me . Don 't you leave me ! [ Syringe drops ] Simon , I have other patients who need me . But they 're not about to die ! Neither are you . And that 's a promise . [ Rattling ] God damn you people ! Mr. Cable , please have some consideration for others . Then get me off this thing . The doctor 's orders were quite clear . Yeah , I know , I know . But I 'm claustrophobic . One hand . Yeah , well , if it 'll keep you quiet for a moment . But just a moment . Mr. Cable , I am not gonna fight you . What I will do is call security . Mr. Cable , you are meant to stay here until you 're ready ... What are you looking for ? He was here . I know he was . It 's 2002 . Someone just tried to kill me . I promise you , kid , that is not true . - Pralidoxime is known - - - You 're not listening . Someone just tried to kill me before the nightmare , just after that orderly left me . You 've got to believe me . Someone came into the room . Shh . Take it easy , kid . Try and relax . Take a breath . Good . Okay . Now , I want to show you something I think may help . Take it easy , Simon . And that 's me waking you up . Keep your head still . No masked intruders , my friend . I don 't - - lt was so real . I just ... DR. NEWMAN : Under the influence of some psychoreactive drugs , nightmares can be indistinguishable from reality . It couldn 't have been a nightmare . You saw it for yourself , Simon . You were all alone in that room . I know I was here two years ago after my accident . See , now , that 's good . I told you you 'd start remembering . And the quicker that happens , the quicker you accept what really happened , the quicker you 'll be able to move on . Yeah , but still . It wasn 't as if I was remembering the past . It was as if I was part of it . I could interact with the people there . I got it figured out , then . Maybe whoever came after you was part of your memory , too . That 's why he never showed up on the tape . I 'll just sit here and look pretty . Was there ever a Dr. Truman here ? Truman ? That vaguely rings a bell . Yeah , ' cause I remember Nurse Clayton and a patient named Travitt . No shit . There 's a Travitt on the 5th floor . - What ? - Yeah , heart-transplant patient . Been waiting here about two years . WOMAN : May I help you ? I 'm just looking up a friend . But it 's 2 : 00 in the morning . And what the fuck are you looking at ? I 'm so glad to see you . Hey . Got a cigarette ? DR. NEWMAN : No , he hasn 't . [ Laughing ] How you doing , Doc ? Mr. Cable , I think we should leave Mr. Travitt to sleep . No , no . Plenty of time to sleep when you unplug me from all this shit . Don 't you recognize me ? Grim Reaper ? We were in this hospital together two years ago . They come , and they go . Come on , Mr. Travitt , please . Think back . Two years . It doesn 't matter . Yes , it does . I was in this hospital two years ago . I know I was , and he was here with me . Holy shit . Wacko . Yes ! Are you sure , Mr. Travitt ? Abso-fucking-lutely . Yeah , this guy almost shouted the place down . I see they won 't let you escape from this place either . It wasn 't a delusion , then . I was here two years ago . It was real . This is good , isn 't it , Doc ? Isn 't it ? You think you 're feeling up to more questions ? Simon Cable , born July 4 , 1 9 7 4 . My name ? Dr. Newman . Justin ? Jeremy . Close enough . And the date ? - ls it tomorrow ? - Mm-hmm . Then it 's the 30th of July , 2002 . I 'm impressed , kid . Who 's the current president ? Don 't worry about it . Let 's get you back down to your room . is Mr. Travitt ever gonna make it out of here ? There 's only one inescapable rule in the game of life , kid . Sooner or later , everybody has to stop playing . - [ Pager beeping ] - Whoop . That 's me . I think it 'd be better if you got some sleep . Thank you , Doctor . I know I haven 't been easy . Of course , we 're not done yet . We have a puzzle that still needs to be put together . I think I just might be up for that now . Okay . [ Footsteps approaching rapidly ] Simon . Where have you been ? - You - - - l know. I 'm sorry . I shouldn 't have run off . It just ... It just seemed so cruel what you were saying . You have to believe me . I 'm not making this up . And I 'm not trying to hurt you . I honestly don 't remember who you are . The doctor swears my memory will return . It just might take some time . I 've got time . I 'll help you . If I did something to hurt you or - - Clair . My name 's Clair . [ Elevator chimes ] Clair . [ Elevator door opens ] MAN : Going down ? Yeah . Sorry . Freight elevator 's broken . This never happens . This never usually happens . You 're going back up , I assume ? Yeah , we must 've missed our floor . Yeah . There 's one thing I don 't understand . How could you and I ... I thought I was ... - You 're married . - Yeah . I don 't regret it , Simon . Any of it . It was you . Anna knew . No , she didn 't . That 's impossible . Yes , she did . Something she said . She knew . She was pissed . I mean , really pissed . You don 't love her , Simon . What we have is ... something really amazing . Anna doesn 't matter . I know what we were . And what you felt . It 's just waiting to be remembered . Some things just don 't get lost . I just don 't know what to believe anymore . I 'll come back , then . We 'll just take this slow . Clair , wait . I love you , Clair . Finally he says it . Yeah , well , don 't leave me out here all exposed . I love you , too , Simon . I wish I didn 't . But I do . I think this is my favorite room in the whole house . All these things growing . I could live in here . Back in a minute . There . Simon , what we just said to each other . It 's serious . I know . I really don 't need this drama , you know ? I don 't think we have a choice . We always have a choice , Simon . I remember . What ? The sun-room . You . I remember loving you . I told you . Some things just don 't get lost . Sometimes ... I can 't help but think that we 're paying for what happened . What do you mean ? I 'll come back . Think of me . Clair . Clair ? Clair ! How about a glass of water ? Since you 're up . What the hell are you doing here ? You 're not gonna start acting funny on me , are you ? How did you get down here ? - You were just up - - - Off we go . It 's the year 2000 , isn 't it ? All year . The Egyptians , they had these things called calendars . Mr. Travitt , will you please stop pressing that button ? Wacko 's flying high again , Doc . Give him a shot in the ass with something . Don 't break my balls . I need to speak with you , Mr. Cable . You know , you should stop trying to fight us . Patients go through extraordinary experiences . [ Talking indistinctly ] ... to help you get through it . And after a trauma ... it 's entirely possible ... experience these things . So , how are you feeling right now ? Any dizziness or shortness of breath ? No . I have some ... difficult news for you concerning your brother . We did everything we could for him . is there anyone we can contact ? Your parents or ... No . Both our parents are dead . I don 't know what friends he had up here . The last few years , we didn 't really get together that much . If it makes you feel any better , you donated blood to your brother last night . What did he need my blood for ? Oh , he needed a transfusion after the accident . He was with me ? Wait. I thought I had the accident before . [ Tires screeching ] Great . H .G . Wells back from the future . It 's been a long night . [ Sighs ] You 're completely loony , you know that , don 't you ? So , you want to talk about horse racing ? What ? Tomorrow morning , they 're gonna open me up and cut out my heart . Gonna replace it with a mechanical pump that 's supposed to keep me going till my transplant comes through . I like playing the horses . I like long shots . I mean , if this is the last conversation I 'm ever gonna have ... [ Chuckles ] Ah , forget it . You 're not gonna die . So you 're a doctor now ? No . A time traveler . Just like you said . I 've seen tomorrow . Trust me . You 're not gonna die . [ Door opens ] Do you feel up to seeing her now ? And who would that be ? Your brother 's fiancee . Why not ? Hey . Thanks . Hi , I 'm Simon . So nice to meet you . Jesus . No . Sorry ? There 's no way you were engaged to him , not even in my twisted head . I was just having some coffee . I wasn 't really looking to get married . [ Chuckles ] Actually , I did have a couple of questions for you . Yeah ? About what ? About the car accident last night . And about your brother . - [ Door opens ] - l need you in the icu . Miss Hathaway . Okay . We can finish this later . Can finish what later ? Simon ? Clair . Jesus , are you okay ? I 've been thinking about you , but every time - - ls it true about Peter ? You were engaged to him ? Oh , my God . How could this be happening ? You were with Peter , and I knew ? [ Crying ] Simon , stop . What 's wrong with you ? We were having an affair ? He was my brother , Clair ! Don 't do this . Not now . - Well , didn 't you love him ? - Stop it ! - Did you ever love him ? - Of course I loved him ! Things change . You know all this , Simon . And us ? Why ? I guess now we have one of those moments . You know . People are always talking about them . Something that happened . Some moment that you wish you could go back to and change . Something you wish you could have said or done differently . So , would you ? Change what happened ? Wouldn 't you ? It 's really good to see you , Si . Was that your brother 's fiancee ? What do you want , Miss Hathaway ? You know , you can call me Anna if you want . I just wanted to tell you something if you had a second . What ? Well , you 're gonna like this story 'cause it 's about your brother . I was alone in the icu when he woke up . What do you mean , he woke up ? It was really beautiful . This one last fight for life before he died . Always check the patient 's blood pressure - - [ Peter gasping ] Mr. Cable ? Nurse Clayton ! Patient has recovered consciousness ! Vitals are dropping ! [ Peter coughing ] PETER : Simon did this to me . [ Clearing throat ] Simon killed me . [ Gasping and coughing ] I left it on by mistake in my pocket . I hate it when I do that . Do you want some coffee ? Unh-unh . That 's wrong . What he said . I would never do anything to hurt him . I loved my brother . Are you sure about that ? Why does this even matter to you ? 'Cause I think you 're lying . I am not lying . How would you know ? You 've been so confused . I would know if I killed my own brother or not . See ? You 're not really sure , are you ? Why are you doing this ? Anything could have happened , and you wouldn 't know it . Who are you ? Who are you ? I guess I 'm nobody . Not like you . Rich family , glamorous . I 'm just a girl who 's trying really hard to be seen . Bet you see me now . You 're gonna blackmail me . You 're gonna blackmail me . I love all those pictures of you in the magazines . Going to parties , living the life . You 're fucking nuts . Sometimes I think , " Wouldn 't it be so nice to be part of it all ? " You listen to me . I would never hurt my brother . Do you understand ? If you want , I can go to the police . I 'm pretty sure they 'd decide quickly what you would or wouldn 't do . Would it be okay if I called you " Simon " ? You know , ' cause we 're gonna be seeing a lot of each other . You 're psychotic . Wait ! You can 't do - - [ Engine turns over ] [ Shouting in distance ] You just don 't give a fuck . Not anymore I don 't . It 's just not gonna happen . Come on , man . I just fucking screwed up . You screw everything up , Simon ! Mom was too easy on you . I 'm glad Dad didn 't live to see what you turned into . I don 't have to listen to that shit . I 'm sick of it . You 're sick of it ? I 'm sick of it ! Get out of my house . What the fuck ? Your house ? - lt 's our house . - lt 's my house ! Now , get out , Simon ! You can 't just kick me out , Pete ! [ Both grunting ] Aah ! [ Glass shatters ] [ Telephone rings ] Where the hell are they going ? No ! No ! No ! Stay away from me ! Stay away from me ! [ Alarm blaring ] NURSE CLAYTON : All right , Mr. Travitt , we do have other - - l told you someone was trying to kill me . I told you , but nobody wanted to listen . Okay . Mr. Cable . Okay , just let me ... I had no choice . Mr. Travitt . No , it 's not Travitt . It 's the one . The one who was behind the door , the one trying to kill me . I told you to look .

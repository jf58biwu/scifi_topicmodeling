 Previously on Farscape . ( whispering ) : Aeryn is with child . Aeryn isn 't sure if the child is John Crichton 's . A relationship is based on trust . I 'm so sorry . I would put my life in your hands but not my heart . Distillate of Laka . One whiff , and the pain is gone . For a time . Take it for as long as you need it . ( coughs and clears throat ) I don 't need it . Just takes the edge off . In view of the continuing danger we face in Peacekeeper space , I 'm reluctantly forced to consider traveling into Tormented Space . Can 't be as bad as some of the places we 've been lately . Aeryn : Trust me . It can . And now , on Farscape . ( child humming ) Don 't touch that ! You knew our laws when you arrived . I was just having fun . Banishment is lenient for your indiscretion . Woman : Many indiscretions . No wonder ... no wonder your men were begging for it . This isn 't helping . Chiana : With drells like you ... No wonder you 're thrown off every planet you land on . E 'Alet . You ... you 're ... you 're friends with the guy up top . Maybe I ... I can appeal to him one on one . The Prefect has already denied your petition , but bids you a safe journey . Woman : Banish her now ! Chiana : After all I did for you ! ( humming continues ) Moya is up there floating dormant in space . This is the first planet in twenty that we 've found that has any drinking water . You are going to get us kicked off . I didn 't do anything . I know your need for vengeance . Do you , Gaashah ? Would you sit by if an outsider had been with your son ? Oh . Is he the cute one ? I remember him . What 's your kid 's name ? Zer-boy ? Zerbat ! Oh , Zerbat . Chiana , you are such a fekkik . Chiana ? Come here now . I 've preprogrammed a course for Moya . I 'll be bored to death out there . Well Chiana , you 've been banished . Yeah , only from Gaashah 's clan . One prospect in each one . Oh , that 's a great idea . - Come on . Now , once you 're in there , don 't touch any of the controls . More than you know is at stake here . I understand ... Nothing . No one does . Unity of the clans is new . Peace is new . But even I know such peace is too fragile to be endangered ... ( engine roaring ) ... by some indelicate whore . ( roaring ) Crichton : Gone but not forgotten . What of the others ? What , Aeryn and Sikozu ? No , no . Nun and nunner . Perfect ladies at all times . Aeryn : Crichton . Yeah , I gotta take this . Aeryn , I see that Elvis has left the building . What ? What does that mean ? That means that Prefect Falaak has graciously accepted our apology for Chiana 's conduct , as well as our emergency generator as compensation . ( giggling ) Come on . Aeryn ? It 's a good deal . It allows us all to stay on the planet . The Comms are frelled . Call me later . Seems a bit moody . Man , you should have met her mother . Gaashah : The only risk is that my failure will signal there 's more to be gained from war than from peace . Let me help you . The less anyone sees of you and your friends , the better for me . Aeryn , I talked to Rygel . He said that Moya 's still out of commission . How you doing ? I 'm getting a really bad bribe . Oh God , she 's talking English . " Vibe . " It 's a really bad vibe . ( sniffing ) ( sighing ) D 'Argo may be right . Until we find another source of food and water ... Officer Sun ? I 'll get back to you . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . Three years ago I got shot through a wormhole . I 'm in a distant part of the universe aboard this living ship of escaped prisoners , my friends . I 've made enemies . Powerful , dangerous . Now all I want is to find a way home to warn Earth . Look upward and share the wonders I 've seen . I 'm such a welnitz , Gaashah . You 're gonna be Prefect soon . I could always come back then . That would be suicide for you and your friends . Oh ? This place is run by tight asses . How can you be so selfish ? Moya is up there floating dormant in space . This is the first planet in twenty that we 've found that has any drinking water . You 're going to get us kicked off . What ? Frell you . You are such a fekkik . Gaashah . Gaashah , wait . Gaashah ... Give me a reason not to kill you . All of you . Now . One stab , my clan is avenged . The leaders are reassured . I am made Prefect , a hero to my people . We are going to leave the microt our Leviathan revives . Only criminals come to this part of space . Perhaps there 's a price on your head . A bounty I could claim for my people ? Killing you would improve everything . We Luxans , too , struggle to overcome our violent past . It 's what I know in my bones . As my father knew , and his father before him . More than you know is at stake here . I understand ... Nothing . No one does . Unity of the clans is new . Peace is new . But even I know such peace is too fragile to be endangered ... ( engine roaring ) ... by some indelicate whore . Nobody on this planet gives a dren about Chiana . The problem isn 't simply her . It 's your son . When the wars were ongoing , I traded my herd to send Zerbat off-planet , where he 'd be safe , where he could learn other disciplines . And a Prefect 's son cannot be seen as an outsider . All the other clans view him as corrupted by outside influences . And then we bring Chiana . ( roaring ) It all smells wonderful . Gaashah . Ucuz . Ucuz ? Ripe from harvest . Our women nurse their babies with it . Mmm ... - Brother . ( D 'Argo clears throat ) ( Gaashah laughing ) No . No , really , it 's very , very good . Jabuka clan 's finest etmek . Jabuka clan etmek is most tasty . Fit for a Prefect . A flavor ... you may never know . I thought your ascension to the prefecture was predetermined ? If he acquires enough votes , I can be removed as unworthy . Removed how ? Kill you ? It 's one of Paroos ' little ... negotiations . 200 clans , 200 chieftains ... 2,000 grudges to accommodate . One little priest has that much sway over all the clans ? Oh , he can be ... compelling . Compelling enough for you to risk your own life ? The only risk is that my failure will signal there 's more to be gained from war than from peace . Let me help you . The less anyone sees of you and your friends , the better for me . D 'Argo : He wants us to leave . Crichton : Moya may not be revived yet . I think you should go . ( in Scottish accent ) : What if I don 't want to , Cap 'n ? He respects me . It would help if I could show him that I have you under some sort of control , more or less . Right . I 'll check in with the ship . ( whispering ) : Hey , ( clicking tongue ) Sikozu ? Tasting the local spices , are we ? Go away , you dirty girl . ( growling ) They would stone you to death if I turned you in . Okay . They have banished me for being with nobodies . I would say they 'd probably impale you on a pole for shacking up with their prince . We 're not shacking up . I would not tell anyone about this if I were you . I 'm not even meant to be here . Who am I gonna tell ? D 'Argo : Exactly ! That 's what I wanna know , when I put you on that Prowler myself ! How did you get off it ? ! How did you get the autopilot turned off ? ! - You wanna know how I got off ? No , I don 't wanna know . - Of course I got off it ! I don 't wanna know ! What I do wanna know ... - Yeah , what do you wanna know ? ... is does anyone else know that you 're here ? - You tell me what you wanna know . Of course not . I 'm just sneaking around like I always am . Good . - Yeah . Well , turn around ... - Frell you ! ... and sneak back to the ship . Chiana : You know what ? I think this Captain thing has really gone to your head ! Okay . Crichton wants you back on the Transport Pod now . And don 't argue . The sooner she goes , she and all of us will be able to come back . It 's your father who needs you now . He 's right . ( weapons firing ) It 's a good deal . It allows us all to stay on the planet . Aeryn ? Aeryn : The Comms are frelled . Call me later . Seems a bit moody . You should have met her mother . Well ... I should be going . You have to pack up and hand over the keys to a new tenant . Interesting system you have . Every half cycle , a new leader takes over . It 's a little disruptive . Well , they say change is good . Invigorating . It 's frightening . It takes a three day festival to distract from the terror that someone from another clan is assuming power . It took me months of haggling beyond that to gain the slightest support . Mmm . Better than , uh , clubs and machetes approach . Many would be eager to return to that . At least we understood it . Right . Well , have a nice day . ( panting ) You 've returned seeking forgiveness . Well , I know how you feel about nixers like me . ( sinister chuckling ) I rather like nixers like you . So is it true what they say about priests ? Hmm ... They give great religious experience ? What I give is great consequence . D 'Argo : I 'm no ambassador . Crichton : Well , you got Gaashah talking without giving away parts of the ship . That 's better than I did . He wants us to leave . Moya may not be revived yet . Well , I think it 's important that the future Prefect knows he can count on me . Hey , Moya 's not just taking a catnap up there , you know . This Tormented area of space is beating the crap out of her . ( in Scottish accent ) : And I don 't know when I can get the systems back on line , Cap 'n . I think you should go . What if I don 't want to , Cap 'n ? He respects me . It would help if I could show him that I have you under some sort of control , more or less . Right . I 'll check in with the ship . Ryg , what 's shaking up there , man ? Is Chiana back yet ? Rygel : I didn 't know she was coming . Well , you know Chiana . I guess that means Moya 's senses are still out . I am ... puzzled by off-worlders . Yeah . I know what you mean . I have ... concerns about you . ( chuckles ) A lot of people feel that way . Your boss seems to think I 'm okay , so ... Be careful . The stairs are quite slippery . ( thunder rumbling ) Thanks for the warning . Crichton : Aeryn ? Thank you . - Talked to Rygel . He said that Moya is still out of commission . How you doing ? I 'm getting a really bad bribe . Oh God , she 's talking English . " Vibe . " It 's a really bad vibe . ( sniffing ) D 'Argo may be right . Until we find another source of food and water , cozying up to Gaashah may be the only solution . Officer Sun ? I 'll , um ... I 'll get back to you . ( child 's footsteps approach ) ( child mutters ) ( weapons firing ) ( weapons firing ) ( screaming ) ( yelling ) : No ! ( screams ) D 'Argo : It was Aeryn . What ? No way . Aeryn wouldn 't ... I know who shot me . D 'Argo : She wasn 't even looking . D 'Argo , Aeryn would not ... I know who shot me ! ( grunts ) Take their weapons . Chiana : Frell . Right ! Hold it . Where is the assassin ? I wouldn 't tell you , even if I knew . You came to the planet together . You 're all assassins together . She shot him , too fekface . - Quiet ! Tell me where she is , or I 'll have your head as well . That is not your decision . Keep out of this , priest . Paroos : The clans agreed to follow the law . The law says we can hunt down murderers . Only by command of the clan 's next leader , Gaashah 's son . The boy ? ! A leader ? Where 's his weapon ? Where 's the fire in his eyes ? He 's as much an outsider as those who murdered his father ! Who broke the peace ? ( inhales deeply ) What clan attacked ? Not a clan , an outsider . She escaped us . Find her . Kill her . And if she acted on anyone 's behalf we 'll catch her and torture her until she tells us . Damn , how come I didn 't think of that before ? The way the clans tortured the others ? Others ? Crichton : What others ? Two clan leaders were killed . Before we arrived ? And you drenheads are trying to blame that on us ? Look , just let me go . I 'll ... I 'll bring her back . You make a lot of noise ... for an outsider . I will go . I have the right to avenge my father . To see his killer brought to justice . That is the law . Jabuka : And will you need your nanny ? My father is dead . You just insulted the leader of his clan . I will go , and I 'll take him with me . He will lead me to her . We have another duty first . The burial sacraments . Maybe Gaashah wasn 't even the target . Maybe she was aiming at something else and he wandered into the line of fire . You 're talking about my father . His blood is still wet on the ground thanks to your friend 's vicious hand . It 's my mistake . I was just thinking out loud trying to figure out why . Why ? Why an outsider would come all this way to kill my father , a good man ? ( cocks weapon ) And my father was a good man . Sikozu : Are you going to kill him here ? What ? Did you come to question my resolve ? Because I will avenge my father . I can handle this myself . By putting a gun to the head of the only person who can help us find Aeryn ? I am leader of my tribe now . Which makes you what ? Just like all the rest ? Crichton : Maybe we should keep moving before Aeryn takes out another clan leader . I think that maybe we should split up . Zerbat : So you can run ? Son , at this point , you either trust me or you don 't . Right . Sikozu and I will take the trail up the ridge . You continue along the bank . We 'll cross down to you further along . ( thunder rumbling ) ( singing quietly ) : Oh , you take the high road and I 'll take the low road And I 'll be in Scotland before you . ( thunder rumbling ) Aeryn : Behind you . Did I kill Gaashah ? Yeah . Why ? I have no idea . That 's all I remember thinking . I can 't stop myself . What about the others ? What others ? D 'Argo , for one . What ? He 'll be all right . There were no others . It was just Gaashah . One clean shot . How much chakan oil for one clean shot ? ( weapon clicks ) How many ? How many people did I kill ? Paroos : Seventeen . You better slow down , Crusty . People kill each other on this planet all the time . Finding a way to kill Gaashah was finding a way to start war . She has no reason to start a war . I know . I suspect you 're being used . By who ? I need evidence . Until now , nothing presented itself . The other assassins were both killed instantly . She 's the only one left alive long enough to speak . But I was completely out of control . I don 't remember anything . Then we must see to it that you do . I aimed and I shot him . Paroos : And ... ? And that 's all I see . We 're not getting anywhere . Try again . I 'm trying . It 's all I see . It 's all I remember . Paroos : Then don 't see . Listen . ( sighs ) There was a child . Is he ... Still alive . ( sighs ) ( grunts ) I hit the child ? Uh ... ( pants ) Why did I hit the child ? No . That wasn 't real . I never really hit him . I never actually hit the child . ( insect buzzing ) Who cares ? A bug . ( buzzing ) Aeryn : A ... a ... a bug ... bit me and I ... ( distorted buzzing ) Uh ... ( loud buzzing ) ( panicked grunting ) A bug . A bug bit me . Paroos : There are no bugs on this planet . ( breath quivers ) ( panting ) I killed them . I killed those people . I ki ... I killed them all . ( screams ) Bug bites ? Flashes ? I killed them all . I 'm gonna leave now . Before there 's another killing . What ? ( draws weapon ) Me . I 'm the next assassin . ( coughing ) Okay . Heap-big smoke . No bugs . No flashes . Can we breathe now ? Are you sure you 're both stabilized ? Yes . - Yes . Then you may need this . Winona . How the hell did you get her ? Peacefully . For the most part . Mmm . Uh , we need to go , quickly . Nobody 's going anywhere ! Please ! Reach for it . Or shall I gun you down the way you did my father ? He never so much as drew his blade ! She 's not responsible for Gaashah 's death . A dozen clansmen saw her . Crichton : She was being controlled . ( scoffs ) : Lies ! She got bit by an insect which allowed her to be controlled . We do not have insects on this planet . No ? Well , what do you call that ? Or those ? Why ? Who brought them here ? Enemies of peace . People who want power . More power . This is not possible . It 's not possible . Who did your father trust , Zerbat ? Paroos . He always trusted Paroos . And do you trust your father 's judgment ? And yours . Then we have work to do . Hey kids , we may be forgetting something . Don 't we need to bug bomb a hive ? Paroos : The insects are off-world . I didn 't bring them , you didn 't bring them . So essentially we 're looking for ... An off-worlder . Your sgabba flies failed ! They have no attraction to this particular alien species . Everybody likes me . ( yells ) It 's not my fault the priest is still alive . These outsiders are difficult . You told me you could control them . The sgabba flies implant subtle subliminal signals . My mental powers intensify those signals . Your impaired mental powers . The clansmen 's hatred is easy to exploit . These outsiders have no reason to kill . It takes more sgabba . More time . I 'm not paying you to make excuses . You 're here to incite anarchy . War . You are not paying me enough . I want ... double . Will that pay for the extra sgabba to eliminate the outsiders ? Of course . Make your bugs . ( inhaling ) ( buzzing ) ( buzzing ) ( grunts ) ( breath quivering ) ( grunts ) ( insects buzzing ) ( grunts ) - Damn ! You gonna be all right to do this ? Yes , yes ! Are you ? Of course you are . Move . Come on ! I command my clan . Respect me or kill me . Go . Leave ! What 's going on ? Where 's Crichton ? Talk and move , D 'Argo . It 's faster . They 're on their way up to the castle . Hurry ! ( quietly ) : Crichton ? Anybody ? Crichton : Chiana , where are you ? Chiana : Falaak 's place . I 'm blind . We 're coming . The bugs are coming . The bugs are coming for you . You saw the hive ? Mm-hmm . The hive 's in E 'Alet 's head . ( gasping ) Can you hear me ? ( grunting ) Can you hear me ? What did you see ? What did you see ? ( breathing heavily ) Chiana ? Is Cri ... Crichton with you ? Yeah , right here . Where 's the bad guy ? Haven 't seen him for a while . Haven 't seen anything . Too long . This is not gonna go away . It 's all right . We 'll get you out of here . Soon . As soon as we find the beekeeper . ( buzzing ) Damn . What , bugs ? Yeah , just stay down . Yeah , I ... I can help . They ... they don 't bite me . Just stay down ! Damn . You okay ? No , I think too many more of these and I 'm ... Yeah , I know what you mean . Good news is , where there 's bugs there 's gotta be ... Oh , hell . Stay down . ( yelling ) ( buzzing ) Chiana : What happened ? Who 's here ? Crichton ? Aeryn ? He 's still alive . Aeryn : Shoot him , then . You shoot him . ( panting ) I can 't . Me either . Well , then we have a problem . Fight it . I am . What the frell 's going on ? Both : Stay down ! ( gasps ) ( Chiana cries out ) Chiana : Whatever you 're doing ... stop . No . I 'm not sure I have the strength to miss next time . I think ... I 'm just a bad shot . You know , I really thought ... the coin toss ended badly . It did . D 'Argo : Chiana ! Sikozu : Stop her , Chiana ! ( grunting ) Stop it ! Aeryn , stop it ! - I can 't ! D 'Argo : You can fight against it . D 'Argo , just knock me out . Knock me out ! Hit me harder , you big sissy . ( grunts ) They 're getting stronger . Priest ! Stop him ! ( saw whirring ) ( grunting ) ( cutting ) ( screaming ) ( saw stops ) ( exhales ) ( exhales ) It 's gone . ( sighs ) Falaak : Excellent . You have extinguished this threat to our peace . I declare a feast to celebrate . You lie ! I heard everything . You ... you hired E 'Alet . And will the clans believe a banished outsider , hmm ? ( chuckling ) You ordered my father 's death so there 'd be war . Welcome home , boy . ( chuckling ) ( yelling ) Zerbat , think of your father . Is this what he wanted ? You know what your treachery means to your clan . The others would wipe them out , man , woman and child . You can prevent that . You can die the noble hero . I 'll make it as painless as possible . Or you can surrender ! And according to the law , our laws , go before the other clans . And I 'll make sure they try as hard as possible not to tear your body apart . I can go either way . The old , or the new ? You decide . Falaak : I 'll not be judged by you or your pitiful council . Is that your father I hear , screaming for mercy ... ( exhales loudly ) You made your father proud . Sikozu : Making the destruction of your castle your first order as Prefect was extremely bold . Zerbat : A leader belongs with his people , not above them . Sounds like your father talking . You know I want you to stay . As an advisor ? Perhaps much more . ( laughs lightly ) I would love nothing more than to be off that Leviathan and away from those outsiders . My term as Prefect is only half a cycle . We could leave together , as we planned . As you planned . I 'm starting to care about you . Good . But you 're right . A leader belongs with his people . Seriously , that 's the longest this blindness has ever lasted . Then stop using the vision , twizzit . I 'm sure you 'll be the first to miss me , next palace coup . Should have let the bugs eat your hide . I 'll take that as a blessing , holy man . ( moaning with pleasure ) ( chuckling ) Moya and Pilot are waiting . We must leave . What , and leave all these stradrats behind ? I 'm sorry . I 'm just kidding . I 'm just kidding . ( grunts ) All right .

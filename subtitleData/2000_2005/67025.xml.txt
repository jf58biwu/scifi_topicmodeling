 Bobby ? Bobby , where are you ? Answer me . I know you can hear me . Mr. Kane ? Mr. Kane , do you know where you are ? Do you remember what happened ? Try and follow the light with your eyes . You 've had an accident . You were flying an airplane , and the plane went down . You 've been unconscious for quite a long time . My name is Dr. Fellows and I 'm here to help you get your life back . What happened to my family ? I 'm sorry , Mr. Kane . Kristina ! Kristina ! Paul Kane ? Lawrence Augenblick , personal injury solicitor . - I wonder if you could spare me a few ... ? - Do you mind ? Here 's my card . I know this is no time to be using the " S " word but you should know the plane you were flying had parts and maintenance issues . - How did you get in ? - Give us a minute . This is important . - I have to ask you to leave . Don 't be a victim , Mr. Kane . Make the buggers pay . I think we did a very nice job , even though I do say so myself . The door wouldn 't open . No one 's blaming you . I don 't remember anything else . You will . It will all come back . They have a haunting fragrance , don 't they ? I heard about your family . I thought you might appreciate an American voice . I just can 't tell you how sorry I am . Thank you . But , Paul , you know , this Dr. Fellows is not ... She 's a private contractor , hired from the outside for your rehab and that means that your discretion is required . God , it 's good to see you again , Paul . When was the last time ? I can 't quite remember . I remember . It was Paris . Yes , of course , Paris . Be careful what you say to Dr. Fellows , Paul . Very good . Your hand-eye coordination is improving . Keep this up and you 'll be back in the office in no time . - What office ? - It 's a figure of speech . Your file says you work from home , been in the country nearly two years . Some sort of consulting business , I think . Luckily , you don 't need good hand-eye coordination for that . You speak French very well . Well , I studied in Switzerland for a year . - Yours isn 't bad either . - My mother was French . That 's all she spoke around the house when I was growing up as a kid . What else does it say in my file ? You 're 44 years old , 6 feet tall , 200 pounds , and you have exceptional reflexes . What does it say in your file ? That I 'm a psychiatrist specializing in trauma . How did you know I speak French ? Wild guess . You ready ? Look familiar ? Not really . Don 't worry . Visual memory is only fragments of images at best . Your recovery means stitching them together into something that makes sense . Where are they buried ? - When was the funeral ? - March . My dad was a flyer , made a career out of the military . I guess you could say I was an Air Force brat . Grew up on bases all over the world : Italy , Germany , lots of different places . He was shot down over North Vietnam . His body was never recovered . Which one is it ? It 's that one . The sign was Kristina 's idea . She wanted it to be just like home . I 'd like to go in alone , if you don 't mind . This is not going to be easy . You sure you 're ready ? Thanks for the ride , doctor . Hello , Paul . Oh , hello , Frank . I 've been picking up your mail . It 's on the table inside . Look , Janet and I wanted you to know well , if there 's anything we can do , please just let us know . Thank you , Frank . I appreciate that . Yes . - Who is this ? - Kelton Reed . I just wanted to call , see if everything was okay . Everything 's fine . Did you get the personal effects I sent over ? Yes , I did . I 'm sorry , but we didn 't know for sure if you were going to make it . If there 's anything missing ... No . It looks like it 's all here . We 'll talk soon , then . - Good morning , Mr. Kane . - Good morning . I expect when you got home , a lot of things you 'd forgotten came rushing back . One or two . It 's not uncommon . Familiar surroundings . Sometime even the most mundane objects can trigger incredibly powerful memories . Memories can be vivid . A smell , a sound . Paul ? What were you thinking about ? Oh , nothing . It was nothing . I didn 't tell Dr. Fellows about the gun , of course . I didn 't tell her about any of it : My recruitment , my training . What do you tell her ? Oh , I tell her about bee stings and tree houses , about my first bicycle about catching frogs in the ditch behind the house I grew up in . That 's what she wants to hear about most of the time : What kind of childhood I had , what I remember of it . Does she ask about your work ? Sometimes . It 's a consulting business . What 's to know ? The reason you 're here in London ? Emerging markets . That 's good . Safe is good . You are the best , Paul , the best we have . Dr. Fellows . Mr. Kane . I didn 't hear from you today . I was concerned . Oh , I apologize . I meant to call . - I 'm not interrupting anything , I hope . - No , no , I was just in the kitchen . - I 'm sorry , were you eating ? - I was gonna cook some pasta . I eat out . Every night , in fact . - All by yourself ? - Mostly , yes . - You don 't like company ? - Not particularly . Not unless it has to do with work . It 's the family house . It 's not surprising . When I do think about them during holiday times , for example , I ... Must be very painful . Well , the strange thing is that I don 't think about them that often . People cope in different ways . I know I 'm supposed to feel guilty about that , but for some reason I don 't . And the things I do remember , some details are missing . For example , I know that I should stop at a red light but I don 't remember having ever stopped at one before . It 's the inability to access associative memory . It 's common with injuries like yours . Thank you . - I hope you like French . - Yes , I do . My mother was French . Yes , I know . That 's right , you know everything about me , and I know absolutely nothing about you . - What would you like to know ? - What is your first name ? Except that . That 's the thing I hate most . Why ? - Harriet . - That 's bad ? Harriet got five A-Levels and a Double First from Cambridge . It was an anti-boy signal , forced me to hit the books . That 's some name . Ever think of changing it ? Oh , I did . Oh , I gave myself any number of names that I begged them to call me growing up . Lulu , Cindy , Anastasia . Didn 't matter , the reality of Harriet prevailed . Something to drink , sir ? And what if they had called you Lulu or Cindy or Anastasia ? Who knows ? You can 't go back and relive your childhood under different circumstances , can you ? I don 't think I 'd want to . I had a very happy childhood but it 's an interesting idea . So after I graduated from Cambridge , I started research into ... Do you ... ? Do you know those two men ? No , I don 't think I do . Quite a party in prospect . Cocktails for a president-in-waiting . Thing is , if he does form the next government we lose all privileges . What are we gonna do about that ? Relax , already taken care of . - Madam , monsieur , everything satisfactory ? - Wonderful , thank you . No , I invited you , remember ? All right . If you 'll excuse me just one second . What 's your name ? Maynard . - Are you following me , Maynard ? - Orders . Kelton Reed . You tell him I 'm ready . - Is everything all right ? - Everything 's fine . You mind if I drive ? I would ask you in , but ... No , no , no . I have an early appointment . Well , thanks for dinner . Paul . It 's so good to see you . You know , Kelton and I , when we lost Ben , I didn 't want to live any more . But you gotta go on . You know , you 're like a son to him now . Here you go , sweetheart . Now you be real careful . That 's hot now . Billy , you back again ? How many of these things you gonna eat ? Honey , look what I 've got . Paul ! Come on , let 's get out of here . You know , you broke Maynard 's nose . The other guy 's got cracked ribs . Who were those guys ? Local assets . Ex-British Special Forces . Not so special . So you want to go back to work ? Yeah , I think I do . - Hello ? - Good morning , doctor . Oh , Mr. Kane . I 'm sorry to get you so early . Is this a bad time ? No , no , it 's fine . Is there a problem ? No . I just wanted to apologize . I won 't be able to make our next session . I 'm off on a business trip . A business trip ? Isn 't it a bit soon ? - Well , don 't worry , I 'm feeling all right . - Where are you going ? Amsterdam . - What 's in Amsterdam ? - Oh , a couple of meetings . I see . You may find that you have difficulty getting on the plane . I don 't think it will be a problem . I didn 't want you to be concerned . I see . Well , have a good trip . And if you experience any anxieties at all , don 't hesitate to call me anytime . Thank you . I 'll be in touch . I 'm David . Joelle . Give me your hand . - Excuse me , my wife ... - That 's all right . Just go this way . Thank you . Oh , hello . - Hello . Lovely meeting you . - Nice to see you . Yes . This is my wife , Annette . Excuse me , sir . I 'm so sorry . Please , let me tend to that immediately . Excuse us , please . Here we are , sir . Make a wish , Paul , and blow out the candles . Shoot him . Shoot him ! - Come on ! - Go ! Lbrahim ? Oh , God ! Lbrahim ? Oh , God ! - I 'm sorry . - Money , now ! Give me your watch . Now , the ring . What 's the next flight to London ? Sorry , sir , nothing now until tomorrow morning . Shite ! - Yes ? - I missed the train . We know . Where are you ? I 'm at the airport . I don 't know what happened . It 's all right . Your partner caught it in time . - I guess I wasn 't as ready as I thought . - Forget about it . There 'll be other trains . - When are you flying back ? - In the morning . I 'll be at Heathrow at 6 : 40 . I 'll be waiting . - Hello ? - Hi , it 's Paul . I hope I didn 't wake you . No , no , no . I needed to get up anyway . Where are you ? Sounds like you 're on a plane . - Yes , I 'm flying back this morning . - That was a short trip . Yeah , let me ask you a question . Who is Chilly Willy ? Chilly Willy ? It 's a cartoon character , I think . - A cartoon character ? - A penguin that 's always cold . - That 's all , nothing else ? - Cartoons can be very meaningful . The joy of childhood ... - Paul ? Paul , are you still there ? - Yes , yes , I 'm here . Paul , are you all right ? No , no . Come straight here from the airport . Do you still have my address ? Yes . - I need to see you right away . - Sir , switch your phone off , please . - I have to go now . - Paul ? - Excuse me , miss . What is this video ? - It 's a safety video . If you 'd like to take your seat please , sir . Fasten your seat belt . Prepare for takeoff . I need to go aboard . Maybe if you told me what you 're looking for ... - What 's happened ? - Paul Kane killed three people yesterday . - Oh , my God . - We have no motive . Worse , we have no idea of where he is . Do you ? - No . - Are you sure ? He hasn 't contacted you at all ? He did call me from the plane . He wanted to come and see me . What about ? Doctor ? He wanted to know who Chilly Willy was . He remembers . What size car , sir ? Full size , medium or compact ? Why don 't you just give me any car with four wheels and a full tank of gas . Are you over 25 and with a major credit card ? He told me he was on a business trip . Why was I not informed of this ? I have no idea . I didn 't know anything about it either . But I 'll tell you what we do know : - Your instincts about him are wrong . - Instinct is not the issue . I keep telling you . I 'm sorry , doctor , but I think it is exactly the issue . See , I believe in nature . If nature selects you to be a cold-blooded killer , then that is what you are . - You can 't change that . - That 's a very bleak view of the world . - Lf people can 't change , what hope is there ? - It 's been your job to prove me wrong . I 'm still waiting . Something must 've gone wrong , something we didn 't anticipate . Look , I 'm not blaming you . We both knew what we were dealing with . - What do you want me to do now ? - Stay put , hope he makes contact again . You 're closer to him than anyone . Now , don 't worry . You 'll be under 24-hour surveillance , someone nearby at all times . They made Kane renting a car at the airport . I 've gotta go . Right , got it . Just get him before he leaves the airport . - Hey , Paul , what 's going on ? - Frank ! You scared me . Get down . Someone 's broken into my house . - My God , where ? - Don 't let them see you . - Come on inside , we 'll call the police . - No , don 't do that . Not yet . Let 's go inside . You keep an eye on them . I 'll call the police . Hello ? Yes , this is Frank Butler , 93 Winfield Lane . I 'm here with my neighbor . He says there 's someone breaking into his house . Yes , he 's here with me now . That 's what I said . I don 't know . Well , how long do you ... ? You know who I am ? You 're Mr. Kane . How do you know that ? Because it says so on the sign in front of your house . So it does . Hello ? Hello ? Paul , is that you ? Paul , we want to help you . Can you hear me , Paul ? It 's like he 's circling his territory . We 're not hunting an animal . Lawrence Augenblick Solicitors . Hi , Sonia . Yeah , I know . It 's really quite ... Would you mind if I put you on hold ? Okay . Hello , do you have an appointment ? No . Could you tell Mr. Augenblick that Paul Kane is here to ... ? Thank you for coming in . We 'll set something up for next week . - Thanks very much . - Bye . - Larry , this is Mr ... - No , don 't tell me . Plane crash , severe head trauma . Mr ... - Kane . Paul Kane . - Mr. Kane . I 'm terrible with names , but I never forget an injury . This is what the newspaper had to say . According to the official report , that type of plane had six similar episodes recently . - Now , I don 't want to count any chickens ... - I want to show you something . We 're now going to take you through our safety procedures and equipment . As this information is for your benefit , we ask that you watch and listen carefully . - The safety card shows details of the ... - Mr. Kane ? ... oxygen masks and life jackets . It also shows the bracing position ... That 's my wife . Oh , right , I 'm sorry . She was a beautiful woman . She was never a flight attendant . She was a graphic designer . Down toward the rear of the aircraft ... Something else I wanna show you . Can you read what it says ? - Looks like , " Chilly Willy . " - Yeah . Chilly Willy was a cartoon character , a penguin . Now , you tell me , what 's that doing in my mouth ? You suffered some pretty severe injuries , Mr. Kane . I mean , head injuries . You were unconscious for a long time . That woman is my wife . I 'm telling you , literally , there 's something wrong with this picture . Why me ? Why not a private detective or the police if something 's not kosher ? Because I don 't know who I can trust . I 'm just walking out for some cat food . I 'll be back in a minute . Excuse me . What did they tell you ? - What did they tell you ? - That you murdered three people . - What else ? - They want me to help bring you in . Who wants you to ? Kelton Reed ? Don 't lie to me . I took a big risk following you here . - Have you heard from him ? - No , no , I haven 't . - He 'll contact you . Be careful . - Why ? Watch him . I know it 's ridiculous , asking you to trust me , but you 're the only one ... You know everything that I 've been through . Paul , what happened in Amsterdam ? I can 't tell you that . Bloody hell ! You scared me to death . - How did you get in here ? - You got cheap locks on your door . I called the airline , tracked down the woman on the video . - She 's not a flight attendant . - What did I tell you ? She 's an actress . Her name 's Amy O 'Brien . I spoke to her agent . They sent me this . I also found the airfield you flew out of on the day of your crash . - I thought I 'd go and see what I can dig up . - I want to see her . - I wouldn 't advise that . - She 's my wife . - Mr. Kane ... - Paul . I believe you when you say she 's your wife . I mean , I believe you believe it . But we 've got a good case developing . Let 's not blow it . - She 's my wife . - You think she 's your wife . That 's why I have to go and find out . What are you doing ? What the hell is going on here ? Don 't look so surprised , doctor . What are you doing with my notes ? He nearly killed one of my men last night . You were there . I don 't need to tell you what happens if that material gets out of our hands . Tell me , how does Paul Kane know you ? What did he tell you ? You don 't work for the Justice Department , do you ? No , but I work for a justice department . You 're gonna kill him , aren 't you ? What was Paul really doing in Amsterdam ? Business . Was it business for him to kill a Malaysian politician and two of his bodyguards ? Look , this is over . I 've always admired you and your work . We 'll take that into consideration when we evaluate your situation later . Blimey ! What happened ? Came down near some trees about three miles over there . The investigator says it was weather . - What do you say ? - Same . Do you always say what they say ? We 've been over her from top to bottom . No defects , nothing . It 's all in the official report . - Weather , eh ? - That 's right . Excuse me . Excuse me , miss . - Are you Amy ? - I 'm sorry . I don 't ... - You 're an actress , right ? - Who are you ? My name is Paul . I 've seen some of your work . I haven 't really done much . What did you see ? It was this thing where you were a wife , a mother . You had children , two little girls ... - My God ! You saw that ? The interactive video thing ? That was so weird . You saw it , really ? - Where did you see it , in the U.S. ? - Yes , that 's right . They didn 't even send me a copy . Two days in the studio and then , " Don 't call us . " Since then , it 's been a little here , a little there but I 'm still waiting for my big break . Can I ask you something ? Was I all right ? I mean , the accent and all . Was I , you know , believable ? Yes . Very . Well , it was very nice to meet you . They said it was weather-related . The skies were clear that day . I checked with the forecasts , newspapers . Nothing . No , I remember the weather . It was bad . Rainy , very stormy . That won 't hold up in court . You can 't remember a thing . You 're a head case . Sorry . I don 't know what 's real . All I 've got are memories of things that never existed . - Like that plane crash . - No , the plane is real . I saw the plane . And I saw the girl . I held her hand . I looked into her eyes , and she wasn 't real . All we gotta do is make sense of something that doesn 't make sense . - Chilly Willy . - What ? You ever hear of somebody getting a tattoo on the inside of their lip ? - What about it ? - Do many people get them there ? Lots of people , in jail or reform school . It 's an American thing . Catching on over here . - Jail , you say ? - Yeah . Tats is against the rules . Self-mutilation , they call it . That 's why you put them there . So nobody knows . I 've never been in prison . That I know . What , like you knew that actress was really your wife ? - What are you saying ? - I don 't know . Maybe the crash wiped it from your head . Paul , you have told me everything , haven 't you ? I mean everything ? Yes . Yes . Except someone is trying to kill me . Actually , a team of men is trying to kill me . Right , and I was gonna invite you to stay at my place . Not exactly the Ritz . My ex-wife cleaned me out . Lovely woman . Hey , that swing out there , who does that belong to ? My son 's . Thanks . I used to have one of those as a kid . I 'd swing high and bail out like a fighter pilot . - My kid does the same thing . - Is he with his mother ? - Yeah , I see him a couple times a month . - How old is he ? Six . Nothing in the world gives you more perspective than having a kid . - Oh , I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to ... - No , it 's okay . Look , I 've jabbered on long enough . You get some sleep , okay ? You got a lot of troubles , Paul , but I 'm gonna help you . Promise . Thanks . There you go . You okay ? You were talking in your sleep . Yeah , I 'm fine . You know , I was thinking about what you said about the crash about me losing those memories . - Yeah ? Well , Larry , that still doesn 't explain Kristina . I mean , I watched her die . They took me to her grave . Who did ? Paper for Dr. Fellows . Slide over . And please , no penguins . - Paul , what happened in Amsterdam ? - You mean you really don 't know ? Where Reed 's concerned , I know less than you think . I need to tell you something . I kill people . I 'm an assassin for the United States government . I need to tell you something . No , you 're not . I was a research fellow at Cambridge when they first approached me . Who ? They said the American Justice Department . They wanted to see if a hardened criminal could be rehabilitated using a technique I 'd been developing called clinical memory displacement . The pilot study needed a particular kind of subject . He was perfect , a sociopath with a high IQ and multiple homicides to his credit . His name was Robert Willard . Chilly Willy . Let me get this straight , you saying I ain 't gonna have no memory of my life now ? That 's correct . That 's wild , man . That 's wild . How you gonna do that ? Through a procedure called displacement imprinting . Displacement imprint ? Man , that 's good . Hey . Where was you all 10 years ago when I was killing all them people ? Well , maybe it 's best . Do what you want . Kill me . Resurrect me . I don 't give a damn . The first thing we did was to stage your execution . National press coverage . Not even the warden knew . Then , we planted the story about the air crash in all the papers . We 'd already transported you to the lab that we 'd set up here in this country . Reed was there representing the U.S. Government . We 're ready , doctor . Let 's party . My belief was that if we could erase all of your bad memories from 0 to 6 and replace them with memories of love and support that we could eliminate Willard 's homicidal tendencies . Okay , okay . Make a wish , Paul , and blow out your candles . We matched your new identity with parts of Willard 's an Air Force father , bases all around the world . But this time happy , more loving . When we 'd fixed your new personality we changed your appearance beyond recognition . How long did all of this take ? Seven months . We kept you in a controlled coma for seven months . Please , excuse me , sir . Paul ? I need to know , those people in Amsterdam did you ? - No . I couldn 't do it . But Amsterdam was not my first mission . It was the first real one . - You mean that Reed ... ? - Hijacked the experiment . Yes . And implanted another set of memories memories of being a hired assassin . German cars . I never saw anyone die like that , close up . If he found us , Reed can 't be far behind . - We need to tell someone . - Look , it 's me he 's after . - I 'll get out at the next train station . - No , don 't do that . - Why ? - Because I trust you more than I trust Reed . Where are we going ? Somewhere , anywhere they won 't find us . What is it ? Both Kane and Willard grew up on bases here , right ? We matched parts of their biographies , yes . Did young Kane spend any time on an air base here ? In the U.K. ? - No . We didn 't create anything like that . - You 're absolutely sure ? Yes . Why ? Because I think Bobby Willard may have . There 's more . We played here when I was a kid . I left my mark on a tree somewhere over here . - Look at that . - It 's impossible . Impossible ? Why , because you didn 't put it there ? Because it 's something of my own ? There was a tin shack right over here somewhere . Watch your step here . Man ... The old guy that lived here used to let us play out back . I bet he 's long gone now . What are you doing ? It 's 3 : 30 in the morning . Where else are we gonna stay ? I guess I owe you an apology . For what ? For all of this , for them . If I hadn 't agreed to do what I did I ... I would be dead right now . I realized that driving over here . That , in spite of everything that you did to me if it weren 't for you , I would be dead . We 're gonna have to tell people , go public . It 's the only ... It 's the only way . What 's gonna happen when people find out that Bobby Willard is still alive ? Is he ? Really ? Well , what if Reed is right ? What if nature does win out every time ? I don 't believe that . Bobby Willard cared for nothing and no one . He was a murderer . Then who is Paul Kane ? He 's everything I made him . He 's everything I wanted him to be . Where was you all 10 years ago when I was killing all them people ? Just like a homing pigeon . Let 's keep radio contact to clicks . And for God 's sake , don 't shoot me . Paul , you okay ? This place is just as I remember . Well , that must be reassuring . I mean it 's exactly the same . Thirty-four years have gone by and nothing 's changed . That paint is the same color . That window was cracked in the same place . That tree , the shape of those bushes . That doesn 't seem right . Unless ... Reed . All right , stay here and try to stay out of sight . I 'm going in . Maynard , cover the front . Ford , take the right . Maynard , you copy that ? Ford ? You copy that ? Watch yourselves . There 's nobody home . Maynard ? Ford , you hear me ? Paul ? I know she 's here , Paul . Just want you to know , when I find her , she 's dead . After what she did to me , that 's okay . So long as I get you . You hear that , doctor ? You must be so proud . Paul ? You know , Paul , your dad used to drive a car just like that . Come on , son . Let 's see what you got . Come on . Don 't forget , I know all your moves . Too bad she gave you a conscience , Paul . You 're an assassin who can 't kill . Now what 's the use of that ? There . You see how easy it is ? Paul . How bad is it ? Try not to move , just lie still . Did you empty the gun ? I 'm so sorry . Last night I just ... I couldn 't be sure . What about now ? Then it was worth it . Paul ? Paul ! [ ENGLISH ]

 Son of a ... ! Damn ! Crichton . - What are you breaking now ? - I 'm not breaking anything . I 'm trying to see how our " navigation system " works . You got a microt ? Ain 't got no time right now , Chi . Crichton , I , uh , ... I really gotta talk Chi ! I do not have the time . You don 't have the time ? Okay . Ah ! You son of a ... No . Nerri ... That little tralk ! Aeryn , we don 't know that Chiana stole your Prowler . It 's gone , isn 't it Crichton ? I did not immediately detect her departure because several of my control systems have been off-line . She could be thousands of metras away by now . We found this in the in the Maintenance Bay . It had Chiana 's blood all over it . - What is it ? - I believe it 's a life disc . Some species have them surgically implanted . This creates a permanent life link between those close to them . - Then why would she take it out ? - It is no longer functioning . Which means that whoever Chiana was linked to ... is dead . Oh man . She was trying to talk to me , and I blew her off . Come on . You 've been in worse places . Who 's there ? ! Stop pleeking around ! Let me see you ! Sweet Nixar . Let 's mark her . Nixar ! My name is John Crichton ... an astronaut ... A radiation wave hit , and I got shot through a wormhole ... Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship ... a living ship , full of strange , alien lifeforms ... help me . Listen please ... is there anybody out there who can hear me ? ... I 'm being hunted by an insane military commander ... doing everything I can ... I 'm just looking for a way home . So this entire planet 's covered in graves ? It 's a Royal Cemetery Planet . Haven 't you ever seen one ? No . Chiana ! Well , where did you bury your leaders on Erp ? Just ... underground Chiana ! Next to where you lived ? ! That 's disgusting ! Ugh ! Well ... the Prowler checked out all right . At least she landed it in one piece . Let 's go . You can take the transport . No . These belong to Chiana . ... You comin ' ? Let 's go . What are you talking about ? I 'm not going anywhere . I 'm staying right here ! Yeah , like anyone cares . .. Don 't rob the graves , Sparky ! How dare you imply that a Hynerian Dominar would ... Yotzah ! Does this look familiar ? Of course it looks familiar , that 's because each of these tunnels are exactly the same . Are we lost ? What are they doing to her ? - I have no idea . - Do you see any weapons ? No . ... I 'll go for Chiana . I 'll pin down the others . - Everybody , down on the ground , now ! Move it ! - Chiana ! What are you doing ! ? No one 's ever lasted more than fifty microts in that thing ! I had ' em beat ! I wouldn 't if I were you . You had no right to come after me . We were worried about you , so we ... Oh , sweet ! Now get the frell out of here ! - Chiana ... - No , Crichton . Now I don 't have the time . Hey , Ancient ... Who the hell are you talkin ' to ? And who are you ? Molnon . Taste ? Look at her ! Oh , well ... Vyna 's amazed by you ! Age lines , dead spots . - You 're historic , Nixar . - Historic ... Let 's go Gardas , they 're worn out . Ancients . Did you catch any of that ? Not much , except all the " I 'm worn out " dren . If you find Chiana , show her this , ask her about it . Ask her yourself . Aeryn ... she 's pissed at me . And try not to be too angry about the Prowler . ... Be nice . I 'm not good at nice . Just don 't shoot her . Okay , Rygel . Take me through this one - more - time . Why did you leave ? I told you ! They left me first ! Pilot lost contact with Crichton and Aeryn several arns ago . - Where did they go ? - Down . Underground . They went looking for Chiana . Crichton seems to think she might still be alive . You frelling Luxan ! - What is this ? - My ' private ' property . You robbed the dead ? And believe me , it wasn 't as easy as it sounds . Now leave me alone . That 's right . Get out . Bonus ! What do you want ? You forgot this . It 's my brother . Nerri . It 's terminated . It means he 's dead . I 'm sorry . Hey , I ... I gotta show you around this place . You know what they do if they want you to stay ? They make you run through these-these , these rings of fire ... like , um , naked ... totally naked ! And ... and , once you go through that , you ... you go into the sonic cowl . That 's where I just was . Your whole body , it vibrates . It 's ... you gotta try it . I think you had a little bit ... too much to drink . Don 't be like Crichton . Come on , everyone 's so lame on Moya . Stay with me . You gotta . Or at least stay for the gathering . And what is that ? Oh , Molnon says it 's the draddest . Says it 'll blow my mind . Hey , guy . We didn 't meet before . It 's too late . Buddy , what 'cha talkin ' about ? The lost people know . Hey , hey . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Focus , man . Come on , Focus ... right here . Das ... time to jump Garda . New Narl emerges . ... Clans gather ... It 's time to celebrate ! Way back ... the ancients dug the Royal Tombs ... but the surface is full ! And the Royal 's leave . Now we 're alone but we live ! Who 'll take the stone ? - What the ... ? - Frell ... it 's a sonic net . - You want to explain that ? - It 's a net sustained by their own voices . Peacekeepers use them in aerial combat training , and the sound actually cushions your fall . I 'm ready . Like I said ... Frell ! Das Takes the stone ! Drad . I gotta do that ! - Chiana . - Leave her alone , Crichton ... Come on . Uh-uh ! You know what ? We 're gonna sober her up and get her out of here right now ! That life-disk we found on board Moya was her brother 's . - And he 's dead ? - Yes . I think that 's why she likes it down here . I think she 's trying to prove that she 's still all ... Aeryn ... when I need a psych report on Chiana , I 'll let you know . If you try to force her to leave , she will stay here just to spite you . No . She won 't . Later . And what are they gonna do with it ? Soak the skin and harden the bones , and Das can be buried in the gathering dome . Your best friend 's just died ! All die , Nixar . But you 're frightened of it . Never knowing when it 's going to happen : Should I do this ? or do that ? Fear Nixar ... it overwhelms . Not us . We live . We do what we want . Liberated , 'cause we take the stone . The dead jump the last . I know you get it . Stay with us , Nixar . Celebrate the stone , it 's the second dradest time . Oh ? And what 's the dradest ? Shut up . Shut up . Oh , will you please shut up ? I 'm doing this for your benefit , Rygel . Oh , thank you ! Now benefit me elsewhere ! I 'm trying to sleep ! Have you ever considered that these items might be protected ? Protected ? By what ? A curse ! Oh , yotz ! The only curse here is you ! And anyway . If there is a curse , ... which there 's not ! It 'll just be on me ! Yes ... it will . Vyna ... I 'm sorry about Das . Oh , don 't be , Nixar . Should you be doing that ? Taste ? Hey . What were you and Chiana talking about on the cliff ? When Narl comes , Chiana wants to jump . I gave her my blessing . Chiana ... you got a microt ? Not for you . All right , fine . You know what ? You made your point , and I 'm sorry that I ignored you on the ship , okay ? Crichton ! Why I 'm here ... it 's not about you . In case you haven 't noticed , I 'm not your kid , I 'm not your sister , and I 'm only your your tralk in your dreams ! So , please please ! Go away ! I 'm trying ... to help . I don 't want it , and I don 't need it . I like it here . - I like these people . - Chiana , you realize that nobody here has a clue ! They 're nothing but stoned monkeys who jump off of cliffs ! Then you tell me what we 're doing on Moya that 's so frelling ' wonderful ! Tell me that ... At least they get to live before they die , Crichton . That 's what I want to do . You said to me you said to me , anytime I wanted to jump ship . Anytime I want to leave . Well ... see ya . Feel free to jump in here anytime . It 's Chiana 's choice , John . Great . That 's just great , Aeryn . You know , I hope if I ever decide to jump in front of a bus , you 're not the only one ... Vyna told us you 're joining the clan . You really going to jump ? I might . Molnon ! Yo , Bob ... Marley ... you seen Molnon ? Forget about it . I 'll find him myself . Molnon ... No , please don 't ! Wrong person . S-sorry . Didn 't mean to hurt you ... You 've been following me ... why ? You ... old ... And still you live ! What 's your name ? Janixx . What happened to you ? This happen to all of us , at 22 cycles , ... if we do not take the stone . Gardas and Nixars here , do not like seeing this . So we go away , hide . Make ourself lost . Lost ? You 're one of the lost people ? Das say he knew why this happen . He say cliff has answer . What are you talking about ? I lost , must stay lost You must be pushin ' 22 cycles , huh , Sport ? The end must be near for you , whether you take the stone or not . You been talking to the lost people . You true smart . Yeah , well , it 's easy to jump when you know you 're gonna die . Chiana 's not gonna die . Why drag her into this ? See this ? Three lobes gets you high . One gets you dead ... Never know which one . Are we having a failure to communicate here ? I-I-I 'm not gonna talk ... til you taste ... . Ooh , man . Now , since you taste , I talk . The only thing worth having is a Narl , and I want one . But I 'm scared that if next I take the stone it claims me . So , Chiana takes my place . She takes the stone . You son of a bitch ! You had your time , you leave Chiana out of this ! Just let-her ... She wants to fly ! I tell you true . I 'm going to tell her .. the ... truth . Truth . Only if you remember , Garda , and you won 't remember . I 'm going to remember ! Crichton . Crichton ... Whoa Here ... what-what happened to you ? I had a ... pissing contest with Molnon . I won ... I think . It doesn 't look like it . Yeah ... Yeah well , I got some information . There 's more ... I know , I-I uh ... I uh ... I uh .. I think I convinced him , to get Chiana not to jump . That 's good . That 's , that 's great . Listen . I need you to go back to the transport pod . Take this tissue sample ... I got it from the lost people ... scan it up to Zhaan . See if we can find out what-what 's killing these kids . Where - where are you going ? To see if this Excedrin headache was worth it . Crichton ! Whoa ! Whoa ... not so ... so loud . Those Morna ... they have a real kick to them , don 't they ? Hey , umm ... Molnon told me what you talked about . He did ? That 's fantastic ... That is fanta .. let us get the hell out of here then ! Oh , no . I 'm not leavin ' ... I 'm jumpin ' . What ? ! Come on , don 't frell with me ... you , you understand ... Chiana ... I know that you like Molnon . But he is using you . He only wants you here so you 'll do the jump and he won 't have to . No he 's not . I want to jump ... I have to . - Okay . - Okay . - You want to jump . - Yeah . But whatever you want you cannot want to die . Well , maybe one day you 'll understand . You frellilng ... you frelling can 't ... you gotta let me gotta let me fly ... You gotta let me fly ! What ... what are you ... doing ? Oh , I think it 's pretty self-explanatory . - You 're not going anywhere . - Yes , I am . - No , you 're not . - She wants to jump ! - She wants to kill herself ! - You can 't take her like this . - Yes I can ! - No , you can 't . I ca ... Aeryn ! What the hell is wrong with you ? You are the pin-up girl for ' Frontal Assault ' ! You should be dragging her back to the ship yourself ! Crichton , just ... listen to me , will you ? If Chiana really wants to , she 's going to find a way to kill herself , and maybe not here , or now . So you have to let her work through this on her own . You cannot take her back to Moya like this . How did you get so insightful ? I understand loss . So do I. Did you ... scan the tissue sample up to Zhaan ? Yes , I did . Thank you . Well , let 's get her on the ' dog and bone ' . Whatever that means , Crichton . Now this is what a Dominar 's chamber should look like . Hung with the blood-stained trophies from my conquests ! This cannot be real . Yes ... I know what 's happening . Talk to me , Zhaan . What have you got ? John , the readings from the tissue samples ... do indicate long term radiation exposure . Yeah , I thought they might . But according to your readings ... the radiation level is only 76 trads . - Is that high or low ? - Low , I would have thought . Huh . Is that too low to make somebody sick ? Yes . But , Pilot thinks that the cliff chamber your describing may be acting as an amplifier , which would increase the exposure . I imagine that would be why they all die at 22 cycles . I believe it would . Maybe Das figured that out . You know . Maybe he knew if the Clans moved out of the caves , they 'd stop dying so young . They wouldn 't have a reason to ... take the stone . Thanks , guys ... we 'll all be back up real soon . Goddess be with you , John . Curse , my mivonks ! I know what you 're up to , and it 's not going to work . What are you talking about ? It 's you that 's making everything in my chamber cursed ! But I 'm not returning any of it ... no matter what you do ! I 'm keeping it all , you hear me ? ! Everything ! Do you need help ? Can I get someone for you ? Oh , don 't touch me ! We give birth alone as our clans prepare for the gathering . Yes , and somebody has to do the bungee without the rope , except this time it 's our friend jumping . Oh ! It 's too late , Garda . Now go ! Leave ! Listen , Vyna . We know why you all die young here . It 's radiation . We think that Das knew it too . He knew that there was a way to stop the jumps . Das ... oh , my poor Das . Vyna , if you move out of these caves and up on to the surface , ... you can all live longer lives . Your child can too . We need you to talk to the clans . If they hear it from you , they 'll believe it . No one ever has to jump again . Molnon didn 't make Das jump , Garda . The rules of the clan did . Das understood . In the final , Das scoped that truth ! - You let him die ? ! - No ! He took the stone . He 'll live forever now . Look at you ! You 're old ! You 're worn out ! Now go ! Just go ! Chiana ... Don 't . Listen to me . All of you ! There 's radiation in the rocks . That 's what 's killing the lost people . That 's what 's killing all of you . Garda doesn 't understand . He 's old ! That 's right . I 'm ' old ' ... and you can be old just like me . - I don 't want to be ancient , Garda - Move to the surface , live as long as you can ! The surface is for the Royals and their Tombs . You think Janixx has it bad . Wait til you see what this does to your face . Crichton , get the frell out of here ! This is about me Chiana , shut up ! And don 't move another step ! Ready , boy ? ! There 's your stone . What do you say ? Wanna take it together ? Tick . Tick . Tick . Times running out . Garda doesn 't understand ... We want the stone ! Oh you think ? ! Let the clans decide . Let the clans vote ! The clans will vote . What they scope ... I 'll follow . Are you satisfied ? - Chiana , I 'm just trying ... - You can 't ... help me . They 're just trying to scare me . Get me to cut them in . Well , they can forget about that ! It 's not going to work . Who 's there ? ! Yotz ! There 's nothing wrong with any of this , nothing ! You hear that ? ! I am Rygel the 16th ! You can 't scare me . All right . All right . I 'll take it back , all of it . I promise . Just make it stop . Pilot . Is the transport fueled ? Yo ! Molnon . How 'd the vote go ? You got no idea , Garda . No idea . All the clans . Every one , voted to stay . To keep jumping . What ? They didn 't believe the radiation was killing them ? They don 't believe ... they know what 's killing them . I 'm rechanting the gathering , they want the stone . I 've already told Chiana . I 've given her a head start . It 's gonna be drad . Molnon , wait ... please ... just wait ... just ... Why does it always end in tears ? Hey , old man . - Chiana ... - Don 't come any closer . I won 't . The clans voted ? Yeah . - And they 're gonna stop jumping ? - No . They voted to keep jumping . They want to die . I just can 't believe that you want to die . I never had any courage . As a kid , Nerri gave me everything . I just ... I just followed him . You 've shown me courage plenty of times . I 've just gotta do this , Crichton . And if you die ? Chiana ! You did it ! I did it ? ! I did it ! It 's been three arns , John . Just give it a few more microts , okay ? Lately ... do I seem ... a little ... crazy to you ? What do you mean , " lately " ? Well ... I ate one of Molnon 's mushrooms . One in four gets you dead . Was that supposed to get Chiana out of here more quickly , John ? You eating a mushroom ? Rygel , we 're out of here in 90 microts , with or without you . I 'm going as fast as I can . Hey , old man . Hey , little girl . ... You okay ? Yeah . You know ... Molnon was right about one thing . The jump was incredible . You should have tried it . Nah , I 'm too old . It 's time to go .

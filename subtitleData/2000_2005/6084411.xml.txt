 Previously on Farscape A relationship ... is based on trust . I didn 't want to tell you about the pregnancy until I was sure . Sure you were pregnant or ... sure who the father was ? In view of the continuing danger we face in Peacekeeper space , I 'm ... reluctantly forced to consider traveling into Tormented Space . Can it be as bad as some of the places we 've been lately ? It can . - What 's he doing here ? - He wants asylum . Asylum ? I gave my word ... that he would not be harmed . Why did you come here ? To safeguard John Crichton amongst other things . Can you trust Scorpius ? More today than yesterday . Why ? And now on Farscape . Highly abnormal . Even I can 't eat that much . Is that really your third helping ? Fifth . Highly abnormal . Highly effective ! So , the advantages of only eating ten times a cycle are ... ? Not eating all the other times . Captain ? Pilot ? - Moya has asked me to once again convey ... - Okay , stop right there . We 're aware that you think this planet is a pit an outpost of nothing . Their food 's overcooked , undercooked and not worth cooking . Makes Noranti 's food seem edible . Pilot ... how bad is it ? Without additional zyntian filtration , the electrostatic impulses from surrounding radiation sources will drive her mad . Moya has not had peaceful rest since we entered the Tormented space . This is the only planet we 've found whose mechanics are aware of Leviathans . They can get the job done . But when , Captain ? When their doctor certifies that none of us has space madness . After you . He has already certified free of ... uh ... transmissible celestial dementia ? We 're calling it space madness . Scarran ancestry , however , disqualifies visitation to Khurtanan . Hit the road ... Space invader ! Stillness . I 'm sure that Pilot told you that Moya 's hull protects us from radiation ? Good ... Space madness is so feared on this planet ... that there are no exceptions . Now for the neurologic brain scan . Hey , look . I know you guys lie and all , but ... this is not going to hurt too bad , is it ? Not a bit . No , no , no . No ! This food is dren . I 'll agree to that . Ahh . If you 'd held your scream out for one more microt , I would 've won the pool . Ahh , too bad . Anything edible ? - No ! - No . Remarkable . So , Doc Snot commed ahead , giving us the all clear ... and Pilot says the mechanic is on approach . Wow , that 's crap ! Know what ? I think I might be allergic to something here . Gratification at meeting you all . Did you enjoy the repast ? Well , it 's the first thing I 've had in a while that doesn 't taste like chicken . Kind of reminds me of a big bowl of Alpo I once ate . Perhaps when you visit the planet , you 'll discover better nourishment . Uh ... we won 't be visiting the planet , Doctor . As soon as your mechanic fixes our ship , we 'll be leaving . I risk to differ , Captain . Oh , did I forget to mention not to share the Qatal mollusks ? They 're to be eaten whole . Should the flesh be divided among different stomachs the food poisoning that results is fatal . What did you do ? Initiated the first half of our business arrangement . Bring one quarter million currency pledges each ... to my office ... and I will cure you . Subtitles : PK SUB-66 " Coup by clam . " Know what ? Why don 't we just ... shoot you ? It does sound presumptuous , I know . But I 'm the only one that can cure you . The weapons will only cause the mechanic to resist the modifications your ship requires . Suppose we tell him what you did ? Well , he will not believe you . He cannot help you . And , I will double my price . Care to call my bluff ? Do not delay payment . Your symptoms will greatly mimic ... the uncontrolled disorders associated with space madness a disease they shoot on sight for . Doctor . As I communicated , clean health for all . No threat of affective illness . At the moment . Hey . Glad to see ya . As you can see , we 're uh ... we 're all excited by it all . If ... you 'll excuse me ... Chiana ... Excuse me . Did you eat any of the mollusks ? No . Good . Okay . I want you to put this mechanic to work , but I want you to stay with him . He goes nowhere without you . Okay . Where do you need to go ? The zyntian filter must be installed in a primary sensory nerve conduit . Any neural cluster will do , once we have diverted the synaptic flow . And , um ... I can tell Pilot how to do that . Right . Come on . Right . Y 'all have fun now . Watch out for those Hodian Trill-bats . They 're killers . What the frell is going on here ? Every time Rygel ... vents , I ... vent . And every time Sputnik pulls a face , I get major league cramps . I 'm digesting a large meal . That should not be affecting you . Well , it does . Is this a ... side-effect of the day-glo clams ? It must be . D 'Argo and I both ate the purple mollusks and every time he sneezes , I feel it . Rygel and I had the green one . Somehow it 's linked us . We have to find a cure very quickly . Okay . Let 's go down to the planet and have a chat with our doctor . Analyze the food . If you find a cure , comm us immediately . So we can chop his head off . I 'll need various bodily samples from each of you . Thank you ! Next ! Are you sure ? Absolutely . How long will this take ? Couple of arns at the most . Why are you staring at me ? Well , maybe I think you 're cute . Think whatever you want , but I 'm here to do a job . I just want to see that you don 't hurt Moya . Time to bypass the synapses . Pilot ? We need to cut off power to this cluster . Diverting now . - No , it 'd be more efficient if you simply ... - I do not need your help . Dr Tumii will be back shortly . We 'd like to see him now . Nothing I can do . Damn ! This place could use some air-con . Where the hell is Sikozu ? In a sauna ? Don 't complain . You 're not feeling three overfull stomachs . Okay . This is new . It 's not me . It 's definately her . That 's all for today . Killing me ... kills you . May I speak ? No . Cure first , speak later . Oh , put those away . I promise you I can 't be forced to cure you . And the cure is of my own devising . You won 't find it elsewhere . Let me explain the Qatal mollusk . Please don 't . We give up . We 'll pay . Each mollusk harbors one colony of neurally linked bacteria and each colony acts as one organism . So much so , that if the mollusk is halved , its bacteria alternately transmit each half 's sensations to the other half . Why ? Who ... cares ? Take the money ... cure us . Now that the bacteria have colonized your bodies , they 're communicating your emotional states to ... uh ... force you to merge . The problem is , you are not mollusks . That 's never been a problem for us before . It is now . Your bodies , unlike the mollusk halves , can never merge . And so your symptoms worsen ... and eventually the strain ... kills you . All right . We understand . Fix it . We 'll pay double if you shut up . And I 'll break your neck if you don 't . Cure us all . Now . I will . But I am down to my last mollusk and , uh ... each cure requires the same type as was ingested . So get more . More are being delivered in a few arns . Until then , I can only cure whoever ate the purple mollusk . That 'd be me . I hate you . When this is finished , you mix it with the other linked patient 's urine ... and then you orally ingest . No way . I am not drinking the old woman 's urine . - D. What 's up ? - Nothing . It 's uh ... it 's Noranti . She ... uh ... Is she in pain ? No ... no . It 's ... it 's the opposite . She 's experiencing intense pleasure ? Very ... intense ! Um ... John . Do you think we could ... Whoa ! No ... no . Don 't ... don 't come near me when you 're feelin like that ! Come on , D 'Argo . Just fight it . D. Think about baseball ... math ... Isosceles triangle rusty razor blades ... gravel ... She lost it , she ... This will give more lasting relief . Divide , urinate , exchange , ingest . You and the linked one must then press bare flesh to ... bare flesh so the bacteria can migrate . How much bare flesh ? Hands will suffice . You see , the cure unbinds the bacteria from your cells ... - and tricks the colony into merging outside your body ... - One more word of technobabble and I 'm gonna cut your tongue out . D 'Argo , you wanta go check it out ? I 'm afraid the boy may be ruined for life . I 'm almost jealous . And if this doesn 't work ... you 're dead . With all respect ... so are you . Bioscan 's negative so far . But how can you travel in something so alive ? All the filthy bacteria ... Moya is quite hygenic . She is ... self-disinfecting . She is female ? Oh yes . But wholly controlled by Pilot ... a male , of course . Ahh . Okay ... That 's not so bad . And there never has been a case of space madness aboard this ship . Oh , you 're lucky . We 've had to terminate three cases in the last half-cycle . An outbreak ? I guess so . I thought it had gone . Three cases , out of the blue . They were good men , too . - Real shame . - Oh , indeed . All male ? That 's what makes it a real shame . Ahh ! I believe the mollusks have arrived . Arrived in less than thirty minutes . Don 't forget to tip the driver . Son of a bitch ! Vanished . Lie still ... don 't move . Who ... who is the doctor ? Oh ! Plainly not you ! Did you see who shot me ? Not her face . She disappeared . But you 're certain she was female ? We are all in serious difficulty . We ? Yes . I 'm afraid I can 't cure you . Go on . Take it . Drink it ! - Why do you hesitate ? - What do you think ? Would you rather die than drink it ? Okay . - So , we should be touching while we drink this . - Oh ... so you said . Umm . . Bare skin to bare skin . Not that much bare skin . - But I ... I would have thought the more contact ... - The doctor said no . Oh , yes . Less skin . Here 's to ya ! - Did it work ? - No . Test it . Okay . - Was that absolutely necessary ? - Oh ... one little pop . I just got a fright . I ... I didn 't feel anything . It 's working . John , the cure seems to be working . That 's great news , D. I hate you even more . Certainly it 's working . Just maintain contact . For how long ? Until you feel an oily sensation ... which signifies the bacteria have all precipitated out . No more than a few arns . Arns ? What happens if they break contact before ... that ? The bacteria will re-colonize in their bodies ... and the symptoms recur and eventually they 'll die . It 's not gonna happen . Rygel . You and Sikozu get down here quickly . Right . Oh ! Do you know I 've been looking for this opportunity for so long . I 've wanted to get you alone . There are so many things I don 't know about you ... You know Doc , you might want to give her a reason not to kill you . To cure you , I need Qatal mollusks and I can no longer get them . Why not ? Credit problems ? Let me explain the sociopolitical situation on Khurtanan . As you may know , females are oppressed here , but there is a resistance movement planning a violent coup to seize power . Girl power . So what ? They possess the only Qatal mollusks on this ... planet . They employ them to eliminate certain males in power . So why use the mollusks ? Secrecy . The Qatal symptoms are not known on this planet . They are mistaken for ... space madness . Yah , and anyone with space madness is put down like a rabid dog . We got that part . Correct . But during an autopsy on one of the victims , I saw the real cause . I found out who was responsible ... and I made a deal ... my silence for some of the mollusks . So you use them for extortion and they use them for coup by clam . We still don 't care . Apart from the obvious ... why did they just try to kill you ? I assume that their big takeover attempt must be ... imminent . Possibly they 're afraid I might expose them . All I can do is refund two thirds of your currency . Oh no ! You 're going to tell me where the females are . I thought you might need some help with your equipment . I 'm fine . Sure you are . Sister ! You can 't tell Mekken ! He 'll kill me . Oh ? Well maybe I 'll kill you . What have I done to you ? I told you , I 'm just here to do a job . Yah ? Well then why the sex change , hmm ? I don 't think you 're here to help us . I think you 're here to spy on us . To make sure we eat those frelling mollusks ! I don 't know what you 're talking about . I 'm here to help you . Fixing your Leviathan . Then what 's with this ? What 's with the change ? Because women on my world aren 't allowed to do this sort of work . Sure . You don 't believe me ... I 'll go . Get someone else ... some male ... to stop your ship from going mad . All right , all right , all right , all right . Okay , maybe ... maybe you 're not lying . No maybe . These female revolutionaries run a club to entertain men ? Very popular with rich and powerful males ... including governing officials . Then one night , they chop some mollusk up ... into the hors d 'oeuvres and instant coup . - I should probably go alone . - No , no , no . I got it . Currency . Do we have the antidote ? Just goin for that . Oh , well , hurry up . This place reeks of antiseptic . Sikozu , we have a mission . - I 'm happy to go . - Jirl power . Girl ! Girl power ! Would you quit speaking English ? Aeryn ! Be careful ! Considering we 're linked . I 'd better go before the females try again . I 'm going to miss this planet ... Anybody here ? Dr Tumii ? - He 's tied up right now . - So what ? So , uh ... why don 't you have a seat and wait your turn ? Tell the doctor that Ho 'Ock is here ... now . - What 's all the commotion ? - Who are you ? Dr Rygel . Tumii 's at a colon convention . What seems to be the problem ? Hmm ? My zergenbobs are playing up again . That 's what you get for neglecting them . Take off your clothes . Here ? Yes . For some preventive bloodletting . Most anyone can benefit from the removal of one excess bodily fluid or another . Inflamed zergkenbobs , you say ? Well , I think we should take a look ... hmm ? Take care of yourself . What the hell 's the matter with you ? I 'm operating . You looking for work ? No . We don 't open for another arn . We 'd like to talk to Selva . Who ? Your boss . You claim to know her ? No ... but we have heard that ... she 's trying to improve conditions on this planet for females . It 's a worthy cause . Causes need currency . So we 'd like to discuss ... a business deal . Not interested . We 'd prefer to hear that from Selva . No , you wouldn 't . Sikozu ... are you up for this ? Crichton ! I think the girls are in trouble ! That 's brilliant , Holmes . I am Selva . You wanted to speak to me ? Not if this is how you treat your friends . Why don 't you untie us ? You 're not my friends . Yes , you 're right . That 's a good point . We 're not your friends . We 've come to buy something from you at whatever the price . Two ... Qatal mollusks . Even if they 're telling the truth , we can 't take that chance . Of course not . But killing them will only cure whoever it is they 're linked with . Leaving them free to take revenge . However , if we keep our captives alive ... Then their partners will be drawn here . Where they can all die at once . Ain 't no way in hell I 'm wearin that . Have I spent an arn shopping for nothing ? We have to get into that club . Aw , we can just go as we are . The elite male clientele are all known and know one another . Therefore , we can 't go as males . Well , I ain 't goin as Maid Marian in look at that . That is not a slimming color . Black is a slimming color . Maybe ... maybe if it was black , but uh uh . I wear that color all the time . Look , stay here and die from the mollusks . I 'll go alone . Told you we 'd get in . You say that like it 's a good thing . One down , three to go . Get in , get the girls , get the clams , get out . Come over here . Keep your head down . We need to blend in . Blend in ? Hell , when we got here , the clocks stopped . We couldn 't blend in on Butt-ugly Night . - What have we got here ? - Oh ! I love a powerful woman . You put your hand on my ass again and I will kill you . You 're the first one who 's ever guessed that I wasn 't really a male . It wasn 't a guess . I know a male when I see one . Pretending to be a male isn 't so bad . How do you stand covering up who you are ? Men get treated better . There must be lots of places you could go where you don 't have to pretend . My home planet 's a lot worse than this one . I ran away a long time ago . Never regretted it for a microt . Khurtanan 's my home . And I won 't have to masquerade forever . Sooner or later , women will take power . You ! Put down your tools and strip . Hey ! Leave her ... alone . Stand clear ... or you 'll both die . Come on ! You killed Mekken ! Resume your work . Let 's dance . What 's the problem ? You don 't talk . Darling ... I don 't dance . I do . Crichton isn 't responding . His comms may be turned off . Or ... he could be incapacitated ... by the Qatar mollusks . Perhaps we should contact the planet 's authorities . And if they inquire after Mekken ? Well ... what can we do ? You ... can do nothing . Have their better halves arrived ? Can 't tell . Too many new faces . Give me fifty microts , then cut off one of their fingers . That should tell us . Isn 't this nice ? With the right partner I could do it all night . I really don 't think I 'm the right partner for you . I do . You know , as much as I ... love a man in uniform ... shouldn 't you be on duty or something ? I am on duty . This looks promising . Yes ... Excellent ! - You . - Not her ! Something wrong ? Headache . No ! Not her ! Are you volunteering ? - Yes . - No ! - Leave her alone . I brought her here , so ... - Shut up , Aeryn ! - Shut up ! Fine ... Nooooo ! - Are you all right ? - Yah . I am . I am ... floating ! I could ... I could use a drink . To the bar , shall we ? Didn 't work . No one reacted . Wait there . Pervert ! Ryg ? How you makin out ? I 've got the mollusks . - What about the girls ? - Don 't know . If they 're here , I can 't find them . - Oh , we got to find them fast . - That 's your job . I did my part . I 'm leaving . You 're not runnin out on me ? I can 't help it . I 'm overwhelmed with dread . That 's the clams talkin . And worse still , my limbs are starting to go numb . Damn it , Rygel . The Doc told us what that meant . Should I try the other one ? It 's too late . She 's already entered the final phase . The link will get more unstable until she and her partner die . Oh ! If we 're not cured soon , we 're dead . You get the girls . I 'll get these clams to the doctor . It 's antidote time . Rygel ? Rygel ? Scorpius ... Consuming the remnants of the discarded mollusks seems a risky plan . Are you certain that once you 've linked with the others ... you can endure the symptoms and ... delay their deterioration ? Certain ? No . Confident ? Yes . I 've ... tried once more to contact them , but ... - there 's still no response from ... - From nothing ! Noranti ... I 'm really thirsty ... Oh , it 's gorgeous . But I don 't want any more . Let 's get this filter in place . That oughta do it . Pilot ? Restore the primary path and see if it 's all working . Restoring ... now . Uncanny ! It 's so quiet . The filter works perfectly . Moya and I sincerely thank you . You gonna be alright ? - On Khurtanan ? - Yah . Sure . Name change , new identity . I 've done it before . I 've got friends who help . I 'll probably end up in an even better job . You 're a frelling optimist . Hard to be a revoluntionary if you 're not . Now , really . I should go powder my face . - I think you look beautiful just as you are . - No , you don 't . Yes , I do . The moment I saw you ... in the doctor 's office . You couldn 't fool me for a microt . Not with a face like that . All right . Here 's the deal . I lost a bet . There 's no need to lie to me . If you treat me nicely I might not even have to arrest you . Arrest ? Dressing up is not a crime . Yes it is . But impersonating a doctor is an even worse one . Central Registry shows no record of your offworld friend . Who is he ? And where is he ? This won 't help you without your linked partner . You know ? So , why don 't you , uh ... set me ... free ? Shut up ! Work ! There 's only one thing I like more than dancing . Interrogations ... Long , hard interrogations . Oh God ! You 'll tell me now , or you 'll tell me later . I 'm told it 's a terrible death . Wish I could make it quicker . Get your hands off ! I ... me ... my nose ! You bit off my nose ! There 's plenty left . Now , get back to work . Don 't be shy ... I thought we were done . - What happened ? - I do not know . Why did you volunteer your finger ? Do your appendages reattach ? Tell me of anything suspicious at all . Hi . Don 't ask . It was Rygel 's idea . He 's got the clams . We got to figure a way out of here . All the exits are guarded . - Maybe sumpin I can do . - Right ! Scuse me ladies . Can I have your attention ? - Do any of you have ... - Give me that . - ... one of these under your skirt ? - Now ! Aeryn ! Yah ! Girl power ! That 's it . Just one more bite . Oh , good ! Oh thank you for preparing the cures . I 'll leave this mollusk in the garbage ... outside . But ... it will be consumed by drozil flies or a wild flibisk . You can 't do that to me . I risk to differ . Mmm ... Nice mollusk . What 's that ? One more mouthful ? Oh ! Look at that ! Isn 't that amazing ? Now that we study . No . That we will throw away . Everyone ? The cure works . Ours is finished . - D , how long did yours take ? - No time at all . Frelling forever . - Three arns . - Three arns ! Three arns ? - That 's not that long . - For some ... Well , put your hands together and feel the power . Yah ! Out with the evil spirits ! Give me your hand , Ryg . Go away . I 'm hungry . You 're not eating anything until we are completely seperated . The antidote has already dissolved our emotional linkages . I don 't want to take ... any chances . I ... hate to bring this up , but Scorpius ate the mollusks as well . Yes . To link with the four of us and temporarily override our symptoms . We would be dead by now if he had not .

 [ Man ] Get going . Please . Do your damn job . [ Girl ] You can 't think Milli Vanilli is cool . I will disown you . [ Laughs ] You are unbelievable . [ Chuckles ] Okay , I may puke , but I have to ask . Which one do you intend to marry , Rob or Fab ? [ Doorbell Rings ] Janet , get that . [ Mouthing Words ] Hang on . I 'm like the servant around here . Yeah ? Triboro Cable . What do you want ? Your cable 's out . Is it ? I don 't think so . Okay , I 'm sorry . Wait a sec . Maybe my dad called you . You better ... come in . TV 's in here . Dad ! Cable guy 's here ! Can I help you ? There 's a problem with your cable ? I was just watching the game upstairs . I think you got the wrong house , buddy . Oh . Is ... that your work order ? Who called it in ? [ Phone Beeping Off-hook ] [ Beeping Grows Louder ] Police ! Don 't move ! Oh , God Almighty . Face the wall . Face the wall ! Johnny , check the other rooms . They 're all dead . Got you . Got you , you bastard . D-O-G-G-E-T-T . Two Gs and two Ts . I was the arresting officer . You 're making a huge mistake . I don 't care what it shows ! I appreciate that , but I don 't care what it shows . It 's wrong . I was there . We got the right guy . An X-File ? I 'm telling you , you let this guy go ... more people are going to die . Was that the DA on the case ? Assistant DA . Some jag-off who was ... probably in ninth grade when this happened . What is it exactly you want him to do ? Keep the bastard locked up where he belongs . Did you read that ? My partner and I busted this guy Fassl ... when I was a beat cop 13 years ago . He killed seven people . Now they want to let him go so he can kill again . It says here the DNA evidence proves he 's innocent . It 's wrong . It 's some lab mistake , simple as that . My partner Duke and I , we catch this 9-1-1 . Neighbor 's hearing screaming coming from this house ... on Flatbush Avenue . We get there . Teenage girl , mother , father ... all dead . There 's blood . I can still remember the sound of the blood ... squishing under my shoes . This guy Fassl 's just standing there . So you didn 't actually catch him in the act . Ten seconds earlier through the door , and we would have . [ Footsteps Approaching ] Tell me you got good news . I have combed through every detail of this ME 's report . I have read and reread it . And I am sorry , Agent Doggett ... but the DNA fingerprinting does indeed exonerate this man . You 're telling me there 's no way ? There 's not even a million-to-one chance ... that these DNA tests are wrong ? Actually , a hundred million . I need the reports run again . I need you to do it yourself . Agent Doggett , you ... It 'll take at least 48 hours . That 's too long . Where you going ? New York . I can 't just sit here and wait for this guy to kill again . John ... Look , I get it . Enough people tell you you 're drunk ... it 's time to lie down . But I know what I know . I could really use your help . [ Door Sliding Open ] [ Footsteps Approaching ] It 's time to go . Congratulations , Bob . Best of luck to you . How does it feel to be a free man ? Are you going to sue the police ? What do you think ... you 'll do next ? It goes without saying that my client is happy ... once more to be a free man . I myself am overjoyed . I think today is a day to celebrate . But tomorrow , we will be looking ... very closely at the reasons why Bob was falsely accused ... and incarcerated . Thirteen years of his life were stolen from him . We 'll be looking at the Brooklyn DA 's office ... and the New York City Police Department . [ Voice Fades ] Bob ... Bob , let 's get you out of here . - Thank you . Thank you . - How do you feel ? That 's enough . - [ All Shouting Questions ] - Thank you . Enough . - [ All Shouting Questions ] - Thank you . Enough . Wait a minute . On top of springing loose a murderer ... you 're telling me ... the City of New York is going to pay him off ? Hell , yes , and count ourselves lucky . We didn 't spring a murderer . We sprang an innocent man . Or maybe you didn 't glean that from our previous conversation . Mr. Kaylor , on the off-chance that that 's not true ... what would be the harm in letting us look ... through your documents pertaining to this case ? I mean , who knows , maybe we can save ... the city some settlement money . Or maybe it gets me in an even bigger jackpot ... when Jana Fain starts crying police vendetta . Yelling at the papers about the disgruntled former cop ... who 's out to get her client . Somebody committed these murders , right ? And now that you 've sprung Mr. Bob Fassl ... the victims ' families are going to start asking who . How you going to answer them ? There 's a lot of material here . Where should we start ? Right there . The original arrest report . " Arresting officer : John Doggett . " It must 've been a career-maker . Well , it didn 't hurt when I put in for detective . The murders had been front-page news for weeks . The sense of relief everybody felt ... when we caught Fassl , it was ... You know , John ... whatever we find here , sometimes ... sometimes even good cops make mistakes . Yeah . And I 've made more than I can count ... but this wasn 't one of them . Whatever you think ... I 'm not here trying to cover my ass . That 's not what I think . It 's not . I just ... I just worry that maybe this is about you feeling guilty . I feel guilty . Like what , subconsciously ? Like I was told I sent an innocent man to prison ... only I refuse to accept it ? A cop I know , a man I respect deeply ... he told me one time ... you don 't clock out at the end of your shift ... unless you know you did everything you could . That 's what this is about ... me not clocking out . Bob , I just want you to make yourself at home ... while you 're here . Just relax . Oh ! Mrs. Dowdy , this is Bob Fassl . He 'll be staying with us for a while . Oh , I have your room all made up . I hope you 'll be quite comfortable . Thank you very much ... Mrs. Dowdy . You 're rich . Well , my parents were . I inherited this when they died . I 've been very fortunate . That 's why I try and use my family 's resources ... to help where I can . You do good things . You 're a good person . Well , I guess it takes one to know one . I know some businesspeople ... who are sympathetic to your situation ... and when you 're ready ... we 'll set up some job interviews . [ Bed Creaks Slightly ] I can only imagine what you must be feeling right now . I 'm so sorry for everything you 've been through . And I 'm so happy for you now . [ Muttering Prayer ] [ Eerie , Raspy Whirring ] [ Horn Honking ] [ Siren Wailing In Distance ] [ Doggett ] Hey , buddy ... did you steal that car ? [ Chuckles ] If it ain 't the FBI ! [ Laughing ] Duke Tomasick . Looking good . Well , hell , yeah . I was always the pretty one . [ Laughing ] Not that I 'd steal you away ... from even one minute of retirement ... but I got to get another viewpoint on this case ... from someone who was there that night . And , Duke , I 'm racking my brain on this thing ... and I 'm coming at it from every possible angle . Was there something we missed ? Well , yeah , we arrested the wrong man . I 'm sorry , John . I 've been torn up about this ... since I read it in the paper ... but unless there 's something that you know that I don 't ... I mean , it looks like , uh , we just got to face facts . Duke , you were there that night ! Fassl was the only one in the house ! He killed those people ! John , wise up . Will you drop this thing ? What did you always tell me about being a good cop ? You said never to clock out . Well , I got another lesson for you , huh ? Keep after this thing ... it 's going to bite you in your ass . I 'm sorry . I just wanted to see how you were settling in ... and I should have knocked . I 'd read in your file ... that you had once attended the seminary ? That you studied to be a priest ? I think it 's wonderful that all you 've been through ... hasn 't diminished your faith . I pray all the time . I pray even when it looks like I 'm not praying . I know someone 's listening , Bob . Good night . [ Raspy Whirring ] No . Don 't . Please don 't hurt her . Plea ... Were you here all night ? There 's got to be something here ... the prosecution overlooked ... I overlooked ... something ... I can hang this guy with ... DNA or no . Well , speaking of DNA ... Ah , come on . The retests of the typing confirm the original results ... that the hair samples do indeed belong ... to someone other than Robert Fassl . So , what do we do ? We just go home ? This is wrong . This is ... Well , John , there is ... something else . It 's something that explains why 13 years ago ... the science of the day identified the hair as Fassl 's . I spoke to the forensic examiner ... who ran the tests ... and he found a match in 12 of the 13 key genes . - What does that mean ? - It means ... that the mitochondrial DNA in the hair sample ... is genetically similar to Fassl 's . In fact , it is remarkably similar . It is so similar that it must be from a blood relative . Wait a minute . Fassl 's an only child . His parents died when he was 13 . He 's got nobody . I know . You know ? Then you know that what you 're saying 's impossible . And yet somehow it 's true . Would you get dressed and come on downstairs , please ? Bob , this morning I noticed something ... that I have to talk to you about . The dresser drawers in my bedroom ... have been opened ... and somebody had been through my things . You weren 't home last night ? I think you know that I wasn 't . As it happens , I was called down to county lockup ... on behalf of another client . If you 're going to stay here ... then you have to respect me , my privacy , my possessions . You 're a free man now ... and with freedom comes responsibility . [ Sighs ] I am late for a deposition . Uh ... help yourself to breakfast . Mrs. Dowdy seems to be running late this morning . [ Squishy Chopping , Crunching ] Agent Reyes . I 'm Brian Hutchinson ... the superintendent of the prison . I appreciate you seeing me on such short notice . Anything I can do to help . Great . I 'm reviewing evidence pertinent to the Fassl case . Whatever I can do to ensure ... he gets locked back up again , by all means . Tell me what you need . Well ... thank you . That 's an extremely helpful attitude . What 's your reason for it ? I just don 't think the system should have let him go . Why , exactly ? The court says he 's innocent . Maybe , but there 's another murder they don 't know about . [ Hutchinson ] Bob Fassl 's cellmate ... was a biker named Spud Jennings , a real bad-ass ... or at least he thought he was . Jennings was murdered ? Oh , yeah . We found him in a hallway that Bob Fassl had been mopping . He was lying ten feet from Bob Fassl 's mop bucket . Fassl nowhere to be found . Well , Fassl killed him ? The murderer was caught on a security camera ... once he turned the corner . This is a videograph , a pretty clear one . You can see the blood on his hand . One problem : This isn 't Fassl . This isn 't anybody . This man ... doesn 't fit the description of any inmate ... currently incarcerated here . We haven 't been able to find him since . Don 't ask me to explain it . We couldn 't charge Fassl with it , either ... but I sure as hell know he had something to do with it . Agent Doggett ? A word , please . Don 't you have something to tell me , Agent Doggett ? What do you mean ? The DNA retests . I understand you received the results this morning . Mr. Fassl has been exonerated . Again . The results aren 't that simple . The DNA is similar to Fassl 's ... to a degree we haven 't quite made sense of yet . Look ... I just spoke to the DA . He 's authorized a settlement offer ... which I intend to deliver to Mr. Fassl 's counsel ... posthaste . I 'll send the bailiffs down to retrieve the case files . Have a nice flight back to D.C. We need more time to get to the truth ! This isn 't about the truth . This is about getting a conviction , Agent Doggett . And if we can 't get a conviction ... then the truth doesn 't matter . John ... I may have a break in this case . A suspect . A suspect ? Not Fassl ? You really need to see this . [ Doggett ] So , who is he ? [ Reyes ] I 'm wondering ... more along the line of what is he ? I ran him through the known offender database ... facial recognition ... came up with nothing . It 's like he has no identity . Yet somehow ... this person materialized inside a maximum security prison ... killed an inmate and then vanished into thin air . Materialized how , like Casper , the Friendly Ghost ? When Duke and I ... entered that house back in ' 89 ... we didn 't find ZZ Top here . We found Bob Fassl . End of story . Yeah , but what if the two were somehow connected ? Monica , for God 's sake , this is not an X-File . Don 't try to turn it into one . In prison , this being , this person ... whatever you want to call him ... - he acted as if he were protecting Bob Fassl . - Protecting him ? How , by getting him locked up in prison in the first place ? So , either he 's doing Fassl 's bidding ... or Fassl 's doing his . However you slice it , I 'm thinking this bearded man ... was the one who committed the other seven murders . I think we can prove it . DNA evidence in the Sing Sing murder ... was gathered and filed by the prison authorities . All we have to do is compare it to the DNA ... from the 1989 murders . No . Unfortunately , that 's not going to work . The 1989 evidence has to be thrown out . What are you talking about ? The hair samples ... logged to your crime scene , Agent Doggett ... were not there on the day the crimes were committed . Are you accusing me ? Are you accusing me of planting evidence ? I am simply stating the facts ... okay ? The DNA evidence that was used ... to convict Bob Fassl ... was planted . [ Knocking ] Mr. Fassl . I 'm Damon Kaylor . I need to speak with your attorney . Is she here ? You were at my hearing . I 'm the Assistant District Attorney . Is Jana home ? She 's not here . Mr. Fassl , I came to make a settlement offer on your case . It 's ... There 's no reason to be upset . This is good news for you . Tell her to call me . We 'll work it out . I want to go back . I 'm sorry ? Please , send me back to prison . Uh , listen , Mr. Fassl , I , uh ... I shouldn 't even be discussing this with you ... without your attorney present . But it 's my fault . L-I ... I can 't be hearing this . It 's the truth . That 's not my concern . [ Low Gurgling Sounds ] [ Gurgling ] I 'm sorry , John . You framed Fassl . You saw how it was going down . We arrested him at the scene ... but he-he left no prints , no hair , no fiber . Nothing to actually tie him to the murders . How did you do it ? I took a ... part of a hair sample ... that was found at a-a previous murder ... and put it in with the evidence ... from our crime scene . [ Sighs ] Johnny ... it was the one and only time I ever did anything like that . L-I was scared Fassl would walk . L-I couldn 't let that happen . Not when I knew that ... that he was guilty . Guilty . God Almighty . You know this is going to come out . I mean , no one 's going to hear it from me ... but ... but I can 't put Agent Scully on the spot . I can 't ask her to lie . I don 't want you to . Duke , you son of a bitch , this is a felony ! I don 't know how I can forgive you for this . You break my heart . [ Door Opening ] [ Scully ] Excuse me . Agent Doggett ? ADA Kaylor ... I assume you haven 't seen him . No . Why ? Apparently , nobody has . [ Water Rushing ] [ Plastic Rustling ] [ Water Rushing ] [ Reyes ] Mr. Fassl , when was the last time you saw Damon Kaylor ? [ Jana ] Two days ago , at his release hearing . My client had nothing to do with Mr. Kaylor 's disappearance . No direct involvement . None . I think we can ... accept that . We 're also prepared to accept ... that Mr. Fassl had no direct involvement ... in the seven murders ... he was previously convicted of . How magnanimous of you . It 's too bad you 're 13 years too late . Is that it ? No . Actually , we believe this person ... committed the murders . [ Reyes ] What do you think ? Do you recognize this man ? You know ... we 're here as a courtesy ... which is something the police ... and the prosecution ... never showed Bob once . Are you a Catholic , Bob ? So am I. I remember times in my life when my rosary ... was a great comfort to me . Comfort in times of tribulation . And watching you now , I get the feeling ... that this is a tribulation for you . This man . Is it that he won 't leave you alone , Bob ? Is it that you just want him to go away ? Tell us about him . Tell us so we can help make him go away . No more mind games . We 're done . [ Door Opens And Closes ] What the hell was that ? I don 't know about you ... but that was me changing my theory . What , no more ghosts ? Uh , nope . Just Fassl . [ Reyes ] What if a man of profound faith ... a devout Catholic ... was incapable of contrition ? As in he couldn 't admit his own sins ? Or even that he had a sinful side to him ... as we all do . What if he were so frightened by it ... that he couldn 't even admit it to himself ? Might not someone like that manifest a second personality ? But it wouldn 't explain the DNA evidence . It would ... if he physically became that other personality . So , what , we 've moved on from Casper , the Friendly Ghost ... to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde ? There is a precedent ... in the Catholic Canon itself . Transubstantiation : The manipulation of matter and energy . You mean , water into wine . Or the communion wafer into the Body of Christ . Monica , I 've slept through my share of Sunday schools ... but I never heard the story ... about the guy becoming another guy . It 's the one explanation that makes sense . It explains what happened 13 years ago ... and it explains what 's happening now . So what you 're saying is ... because this man won 't face himself , won 't face his own sins ... then he is forced to become someone else . A killer . So , how does someone go about catching a killer ... who hides inside an innocent man ? Do it . I don 't want to hurt her ! [ Knocking On Door ] [ Jana ] Bob ? Are you okay ? Kill her . Oh , my God . What happened ? I , uh ... l-I fell . [ Gasps ] I 'll fix you up . You 'll be okay . [ Gasps ] I 'll take the next couple of hours . You should get some shuteye . John , give yourself a break . You haven 't slept in 48 hours . I 'll sleep once we make sure ... this guy Fassl never kills again . Fassl and his ... Charlie Manson sidekick . They 're one and the same person . Monica , I don 't want to hear ... Okay , but I just need to hear another theory that makes sense . That theory doesn 't make any sense . How the hell to you does that make sense ? Meat-and-potatoes police work ... is what busted this guy 13 years ago . And it 's what 's going to bust him again . And that 's enough . And the day that 's not enough ... then I don 't know what to tell you . [ Sighs ] 'Cause I got nothing else . I 'm going to go check it out ... the front door . Jana Fain ... check on her . Oh , my God . He was here . He was here ... the man in your photo . The bearded man ? Where 's Bob Fassl ? Oh , he-he was right there ... and then he wasn 't ... I don 't ... I don 't know where . Agent Reyes ? Call the police . Agent Reyes ! " Cable access . " Fassl worked for Triboro Cable . [ Grunts ] Trail ends here . Blood . He could have gone either way . John ! [ Gunshots ] You okay ? Yeah . Come on . I 'll take this way . [ Water Dripping ] [ Water Rushing ] [ Metal Clanking ] [ Screaming ] John ! John ! Monica ! - [ Screams ] - [ Pistol Plopping ] Let him go . You hear me ? ! Let him go ! Don 't waste your breath . Just shoot the bastard . Bob Fassl , I 'm talking to you . I know you 're in there ... Bob . There 's some small part of you in there ... that couldn 't killJana Fain when you had the chance . I 'll kill him ! I believe you , Bob , because you 're a murderer . Shut up ! I 'm not him . You 're not just a murderer . You 're a sinner . Shut up ! Shut up ! Shut up ! Monica ! [ Gunshot ] [ Grunts ] [ Sniffles ] My housekeeper ... Mrs. Dowdy ... can I see her ? It 's better that you don 't . And the district attorney ? There are a lot of bodies in there . Oh . There are many more victims than anyone ever knew . [ Sighs ] I saw a bearded man . I know what I saw . [ Sighs ] Ms. Fain , I think we better get you home . John ... ? I 've been 48 hours without sleep . I found out my ex-partner 's a liar and a felon . Don 't ask me to explain how this could be . So what happened tonight ? All that was just you seeing things ? I can 't accept this . If you can , God love you ... but it 's not the way my mind works . You closed this case . This time around , that was enough . What happens next time ? [ Child ] I made this . !

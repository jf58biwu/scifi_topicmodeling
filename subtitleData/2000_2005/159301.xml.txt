 Bendless Love - Guidance system ? - Online . - Autopilot ? - Present . - Dark-matter indicator ? - Making a noise . All systems operational . Let 's rock . Gentlemen , I 've completed my report on the crash . I 'm not reading that ! Summarize it in one word . Sabotage . This is a normal L-unit . Without it , space travel is the dream of a madman . - Yep . - It 's an important unit . And this , my friends , is the L-unit I just removed from the ship . That 's not an L ! Unless you count lowercase . You know we don 't ! Whoever did this was strong . This is 340 pounds of Tonka-tough steel . It should look like this : But , instead , it looks like this : - Who would do that ? - Who could do that ? And by " that , " I mean this : It looks like we have another mystery on our hands . I 'd better make a chart of suspects . I 'll draw a line with my straightedge . Sweet lamprey of Santa Fe ! My edge has been bent ! My javelin too ! It 's ruined ! Now we 'll never beat Jupiter State ! My Slinky ! My cuddly little pet Slinky ! What 's all the hubbub ? Even the professor 's been bent . Thank you for your sympathy , talking square of linoleum . I 'll get you fixed up . - That 's fine . - What did you do to the professor ? I bent him . - Aha ! - It 's Bender ! A bunch of stuff gets bent , so it must be the robot designed for bending . I know , we 'll check last night 's surveillance tapes . - Tapes ? - You 've seen me naked ? Last night 's tape . It was right next to Bathroom Bloopers Four . See ? Nothing ! I told you , losers ! Wait , there on the screen ! It 's that guy you are ! - I 'm sleepwalking ! - We 've got robots on the ceiling . You weren 't sleepwalking , you were sleep-bending . This is quite a shock . On the other hand , it 's not surprising . After all , I 've been bending since the day I was built . I was born on an assembly line in the bad part of Tijuana . Mama . Hooray ! I graduated ! Time to bend around Europe for a few months , then get a job bending . - You remember your birth ? - It was only four years ago . - You 're only four years old ? - Precocious little scamp , ain 't I ? Bender must have a need to bend that 's not satisfied by his lifestyle . He can 't stay . He 's a menace to every straight person in the company . Go satisfy your bend-lust . And don 't you come back to work until you do ! No more bending , no more work Give us a raise , you big fat jerk Nevers ! Yo ! The mafia supports you ! But don 't tell no one ! Spread the word ! As duly elected mobsters of this union it 's our duty to support the struggle of these slobs . - What if management is " intragnizent " ? - In context , it 's clear what you mean . In that case , Clamps may have a surprise for them . The clamps ! Right ? Aw , no ! A strike ? Now I 'll never get to bend anything ! Oh , woe is Bender ! Management refused to switch casual Friday to Monday . - What ? ! - They hire scabs at 1 0 times our wage ! Ten times normal wage ! I 'll give those jerks what for ! - Welcomes aboard , scab . - Great to be here . I 'll introduces you to your scab coworkers you 'll be scabbing with . This here 's our scab foreman . - Flexo ? - Bender ? Sorry you got sent to that South American Turkish prison instead of me . You bastard ! They treated me like an animal ! And that 's what I became ! No , you 're all right . Good to see you ! And here 's another scab what also works here , Angleene . Hello . Hey , you guys want to move that things ? Hello ! - Give us a raise , you big fat jerk - Nevers ! - Hi , Angleene . What you up to ? - Making hangers . - Counselor said I had a knack for it . - That 's cool . So , I was wondering if ... You know , it 's cool if not , but ... - What are you doing after work ? - What I always do . Jack squat . Me too . Man , we have a lot in common , huh ? Well , we are made of virtually identical components . Are you sure ? Maybe I should peek at your access panel . Hey , according to the Scab Handbook , that 's inappropriate banter . And that 's just the way I like it . Haile H. Selassie ! There , little friend . Good as new . What an exquisite day ! That azure sky . The verdant treetops . Those delightful birds with their chirp , chirp and their tweet , tweet , splat . I 've never seen you so cheerful . What 's wrong with you ? Seeing things from a new perspective has reminded me of life 's beauty or perhaps my posture is causing blood to pool in the back of my brain resulting in a mild delirium . By the way , you have a dime up your nose . I wish . It 's a nickel . Union forever ! Lousy scabs ! They can 't do those things ! Et cetera ! I bet watching me bend girders turns your legs rubbery . My legs are made of rubber . And anyway , I am just as strong as you are , Mac . Oh , yeah ? Prove it . Here . Let me help you . My new bent outlook has completely re-energized me . I 'm even dating a young , Brazilian , retired actress . Some say I 'm robbing the cradle , but I say she 's robbing the grave . Howdy , doodles ! What 's new ? I was regaling your former coworkers with a tale of bedroom antics ... Big whoop , no one cares . I got Bender-related news . I 'm in love . And I 'm taking all my friends out to celebrate . Let 's get liquored up ! Hey , look at this crowd . You guys gotta try the pasta . It 's got a nice profit margin . Bam ! So , special occasion tonight ? - You 'll never guess what 's happened ! - Bam ? - I 've met the most dynamite lady-bot . - Hey , that 's terrific ! To celebrate , I 'm gonna stick seven copies of my book on your bill . Bless you , sir . So , Bender , tell us about this new girlfriend of yours . I intend to , through the lost art of the toast . To Angleene . She 's got it all . Looks , charm and the love of a fabulous bending robot . She sure does . Flexo ! Careful , that 's a week old . I finally meet a nice girl , with legs that don 't quit and that jerk Flexo steals her away ? It 's time to kick some shiny , metal ass ! You degenerate hussy ! I 'm disappointed in you too , Angleene ! - Bender , it 's not what you think ! - God , then it 's worse than I think ! Now look , there is no reason to be upset . - Flexo and I are divorced . - Div ... Huh ? We 're just having dinner to stay friends . I knew that . What I 'm outraged by is your choice of wine ! - Really , it 's the steward 's fault . - Excellent choice , sir . That Flexo , why , I 'm knocking him on his butt . I can 't believe this . Obsessing won 't help , Bender . Take a lean back and enjoy life . My fembot may be in love with another manbot . Well , talk to her . Tell her your feelings in an honest way . Either that , or be a man . I 've constructed an elaborate lie . I 'll call Angleene , pretend to be Flexo , arrange a date show up as him and catch her two-timing me with myself . That 's thinking like a man . Hello ? This is Flexo . Now we 'll see who loves whom . - Hey , hot stuff . - Hey , Flexo . Since when do you go to bars on work nights ? It 's not like you . Nonsense . It 's exactly like me . Flexo , the fun-loving love machine fembots love to love . I 'll have a fuzzy navel . She 'll have the girliest drink in the house . - Two fuzzy navels coming up . - I hope they can change a fortune . Get an eye-load of that scab with the beard flashing his filthy scab money . It 's an insult , boss . That cash should be slushing my fund and kicks-ing my back . - I 'm greasing up my whoozits ! - Whoa . Not yet . Let 's just see if he does it a couple more times . - You 're looking good . - Quit making googly eyes . - I 'm in love with Bender . - Bender ? That walking wuss factory ? He may be a walking factory , but he is no wuss . You and me are through . I told you when I divorced you . Going through a divorce , tell me that didn 't bring us closer . Care to dance ? You know I love dancing , but you always hated it . In that case , it 's something I 've always wanted to make up to you . Hey , Scratch-Mo ! Drop me and the lady some rump-rattling beats . I 'd hoped by the second time he flashed cash , my rage would subside . Sadly , that has not happened . You used to be so inflexible , Flexo . You 've really loosened up . I recently upgraded my funk card . - Come on ! - All right ! Hit me ! Come on , now ! What 's new ? Flexo , what 's going on ? Flexo ! The moral of the story is : If you want it to stay sunk , tie a weight to it ! Yeah ! You always were a kick in the teeth , man . Aw , shucks , thunder-buns . You make me feel like a million volts . Flexo , I 'm starting to remember why I fell for you in the first place . So she 's falling for Flexo , eh ? I 'd better seduce her a little more just to be sure . It 's late . I should get home to my trailer . I 'll walk you out . A true gentleman tends to his date 's every need . Tiparillo ? Here you are , my lad . Bring the lady 's car around in the finest way possible . He 's flashing his cash again . - How many times is that ? - Three ! That 's the necessary number of times . That scab 's gonna have an on-the-job accident . Don-bot , I don 't think we should rely on an accident happening . Let 's kill him ourselves . Well , good night . I had a great time . How about a lift ? To your place ? - What ? ! - Admit it you felt something for me tonight . And by me , I mean Flexo . - Hey , look . I had fun , but ... - But ? - But ... - But ? But ... - Huh ? Bender , you tricked me ! - That 's right , baby ! I ain 't your lover-boy , Flexo , the guy you love so much . You even love anybody pretending to be him ! Maybe I love you no matter who you 're pretending to be ! Oh , how I wish I could believe or understand that ! There 's only one reasonable course of action now : Kill Flexo ! No ! Thanks , I appreciate that . Nah , I 'm joshing you . - That was annoying . - You call yourself divorced ? You 're mocking one of our oldest institutions ! What ? Give the word and I 'll drop this unbendable girder . Clamp-ka-bamp ! Only kill the one with the beard . That other scab , we got nothing against . That 's low . Please stop ! I 'm not worth it ! Probably not ! But I love you , and I 'm gonna kick his ass till I win you back ! Okay , Clamps . Now ! Oh , that 's gotta clamp . - Flexo , are you okay ? - Yeah . Never better . - I 'm yanking your chain . I 'm dying . - You can 't die ! - Bender showed me that I love you . - But I love you . I know , and I care for you too . But I could never love anyone as much as you made me realize I love Flexo ! But ... I love you so much , I want you to be happy , no matter what . - What are you saying ? - I 'm saying I 've got an unbendable girder to bend . You can 't bend it . It 's unbendable ! I don 't know anything about lifting , so that just leaves us the one option . Thanks . Another year under that and I 'd have been a goner . I 'll always remember this , Bender . Me too . Me too . Jerk . Flexo and Angleene had sex right on the factory floor ? - You got bending out of your system . - Yes . I won 't be up to bending again for a long , long time . Perhaps it 's your outlook that needs a bend a bend to a place where happiness is perpendicular to wonderment . - We 're sick of your upbeat attitude . - I 'll say . Nonsense . It 's just like in the song I wrote : We all need a new angle on life You 've gotta help us . I try to get out , but they keep pulling me back in ! Wangle a new dangle on life - No , the other way ! - I like him better this way . - I 'm sad now . - It 's fine .

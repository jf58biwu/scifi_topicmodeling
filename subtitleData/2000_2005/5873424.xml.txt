 Master , I have news of Dr. Venture 's latest invention . Yesterday 's New York Herald , science section . Thank you , Kikai . You have served your master well . Unh ! Wow , thanks ! You totally got the kink out of it . And , hey , I don 't want to smoke anymore , either . Scamp ! here , boy ! Here , scamp ! Golly , we 've searched the whole compound . Twice . Where could that rascal have gone ? We 've gotta get packing if we want to be on time for our trip to the big city . Yeah. we don 't want pop to get sore at us . He 's sure on a tear this week . Aw , he 's just excited about exhibiting his new invention at the United Nations is all . Say , maybe pop knows where scamp 's gotten to . Good thinking , bro of mine . And I thought I was supposed to be the smart one . Ma Venture didn 't raise no fools . We--we don 't have a mom , Hank . Last one to the hangar 's a rotten banana ! You 're a rotten banana . [ Rock music playing ] Wacky noodle . Gorilla fart . Hey , Brock ! Boys . Seen dad ? Lab . Man over radio : Brock. come in , Brock . Yeah . Brock , come to the lab at once . I 've just made an incredible discovery Remember those prehistoric bones we found out at the Moroccan site ? Well , it turns out your hunch was correct . They aren 't dinosaur bones as we thought after all . They 're robot bones . Yeah , right , uh . I 'm kinda busy here . I gotta load all your science crap onto the X-1 . Oh , well , there 's plenty of time for that . You really have to see this to believe it . Plus , like , I really don 't care . Oh , ok . Um , I 'll just - I 'll just do my work here and then I 'll be down in a couple - uh-huh . Dean and Hank : Hey , pop ! [ Sigh ] boys . We 've looked all over , and we can 't find Scamp , pop . Have you seen him ? Scamp ? well , of course I have . He 's right over there . Dean and Hank : Scamp ! He--he 's all inside out ! Dean , Dean , Dean . You 're supposed to be the smart one . You know your father would never turn scamp inside out . I 've simply removed all of his skin . Jeepers ! Scamp 's an integral part of some groundbreaking research I 'm doing for a major cosmetics corporation . You see , their test animals are always expiring before they can finish performing all their super important makeup experiments on them . So your father is perfecting a way of keeping them alive longer . But , pop- - Hank ! You like pretty girls , don 't you ? And how ! Well , pretty girls need cosmetics . How do you think they get so pretty ? So the next time you see an attractive young lady , and you 're sure to see plenty in New York City , you just think of old scamp over there and all he 's done for pretty girl science . [ Crash ] [ gasp ] Brock ! Brock : Stay back , doc . Another one of those mummies got stuck in our landing gear . Who dares to desecrate the sacred tomb of- - Ow ! hey , wait ! wait a minute ! [ Grunting ] there 's no reason to--ow ! [ Grunting ] [ bones crunching ] hey ! ow ! Holy Toledo ! He curved on him ! Way to give him a little chin music , Brock . [ Thud ] well , that oughta take care of that . Look ! Brock still ain 't done with him . [ Unzipping ] [ urinating ] That 's showing him who 's boss , Brocko . Was that really necessary ? You have to defile a mummy completely or they come back to life . You know that . Yes , yes , of course . Hold the phone , what 's this ? Why , this isn 't an ancient mummy at all . These are just ace bandages and toilet paper . Looks like a lot of things weren 't quite what they seemed on our last adventure . Eh , Brock ? Stop that ! Go pack , dammit ! Go ! Man : Dr. Thaddeus Venture . He 's been a thorn in the monarch 's side for far too many years . But all that is about to change . In a moment , you men will be launched into the Venture compound inside this ingeniously modern Trojan horse . My false meteor will land safely inside the Venture 's security perimeter looking for all intents and purposes like a real meteor . Dr. Venture 's legendary scientific curiosity will naturally get the better of him . And when he immediately drills open the cosmic mystery , he 'll get a faceful of men . My men ! Loyal foot soldiers in my war on everything . And deadly ! Just like the monarch butterfly of my namesake . .. butterflies aren 't deadly . Dr. girlfriend , the hatch , please . [ Deep voice ] ready for launch . Monarch : 3 , 2 , 1 , Launch . Fly , my beautiful soldiers , fly . Zoom ! Well , that 's the last of it . Ready for takeoff ? Yes. go. now . Stop it , stop it , stop it . The X-1 is not a toy . Buckle up . Phbbt ! Holy mother of crap ! A meteor ! From outer space ! Probably wanna check it out , huh , doc ? No time. no time . Ok ... Man : I can 't get the hatch open . We landed face-down . Oh , god. oh , god. we 're gonna die in here . We 're not going to have to eat each other , are we ? Screw that ! What are we gonna do about poo poos ? Hmm . Yippee ! The United Nations ! Stay in the X-1 , boys . Doh ! Man : Dr. Venture . We 've been expecting you . Yes. we 're right on time , as always . You remember my man Brock from last year . But of course . We still haven 't been able to get the stains out of the carpet . Guards . Help Mr. Samson with Dr. Venture 's baggage , please . Once you unload , I 'll show you where you can set up your equipment . Super good Oh , gentlemen , be careful not to get too close to the X-1 's engines . Cancer . No way ! No , no. there 's no need for those . Watch . Good god , what 's he doing now ? Being thorough . It probably stowed away back when we were down in Brazil last week . Big one , too . Halt . Sir , you can 't enter the united nations with that weapon . That 's alright , soldier . Mr. Samson is my bodyguard . Just the same , doctor , no weapons allowed . I 'll have to confiscate it . Go ahead . Take it from me . And this is the exhibition hall , where you 'll be giving your demonstration tomorrow . God , who designed this place ? Frank Lloyd wrong ? Ha ha ha . [ Cough ] ahem . Um , Brock , why don 't you take the boys over to the hotel now . Yeah , all right . There 's no tail at this con anyway . Ah , Mr. Senzuri , I 'd like you to meet Dr. Venture . Dr. Venture , this suspicious-looking Asian fellow here is Otaku Senzuri . He represents the Onani corporation of Japan . I 've been most anxious to meet you , Dr. Venture . Most anxious . I 've been hearing a lot about the exciting technological advances you 've made . I 'm eager to see them . Ah , yes. um . I mean , thank you . We have liftoff . Houston to Gemini . You are go for orbit . Aw , I 'm tired of playing astronaut . Cripes , we 're in the city that never sleeps . Can 't we find something more fun to do ? I don 't know , Hank . Pop told us to stay in the hotel the whole trip and not come out . You wouldn 't want him to throw a hissy fit , would you ? Well , we don 't have to leave the hotel to have an adventure . Are you thinking what I 'm thinking ? Probably [ DEAN , WHISPERING ] This is gonna be awesome . Shh . Quiet . We don 't want to wake up Dad . Captain to co-captain . Prepare to dive . Roger , captain . Co-captain closing the hatch . Ha ha. clever boys . But not nearly clever enough . Did they really think they could hide it from me for long ? Whoa , hey , don 't rock the boat , Dean-o . That 's captain Dean-o to you . And these rough seas ain 't my doing . [ Grunting ] ow ! [ Gasping ] where is it ? Where is he hiding it ? [ Gasp ] a ninja ! Quick , Dean , deploy the j-u-d-o . You win this round , Venture . But it is not the last . Brock : Doc . Doc . [ Whap ] Doc . [ Punch ] Doc . [ Punch ] Doc ! I was in the mommy place . Get up. the boys are gone . Not answering their communicator watches , either . Well , find them For god 's sake , I swear , if they screw up my gig at the U.N ... . .. wowie zowie . What a headache . We must have gone off on one of those benders Brock 's always talking about . Where are we , anyway ? Beats me . Let 's check our satellite link navigational watches . Gone ! [ Gasp ] Now I remember . That no-good ne 'er-do-well ninja must 've adios-ed with our watches That cr - Hmm . Dr. Venture 's precocious progenies . They will be his undoing . Cab driver : That 'll be $ 53.50 . $ 53.50 ? ! What the hell is this supposed to be ? It 's an I.O.U ... for your life ! You see , just like the flawless monarch butterfly from which I take my name , the monarch has many ways to sting . Monarchs ... don 't ... sting ! Holy guacamole ! a giant butterfly ! Criminy ! That 's no butterfly . It 's that guy that 's always hated dad . Super runaway ! Boys. come in , boys. what 's your location . Oh , snap. check this out . It 's like some Star Trek crap . What up , fool ? Quick ! We ride the rails . They 've spotted me . Wily boys . Man : All right , there , princess . I saw you jump the turnstile . Let 's go . Plebeian , clearly your fear has blinded you , for you dare to lay hands upon- - aah ! oh , that is it . [ Bell rings ] Aah ! No ! Aah ! No ! No ! Ow ! And he 's always got that big guy with him ? Brock something ? You can 't tell me there 's nothing going on there . No , no . He 's just his bodyguard , is all . To be perfectly honest , however , my proposed solar-powered vehicle is not 100 % free of emission . ... because it emits a special form of ozone . Meaning these cars will actually repair our fragile precious ozone layer ... while you drive Jealous ? I think we super lost him . Good teamwork , big brother . Hey , look . It 's one of those pretty girls pop was telling us about . You boys looking for some action ? And how . We 're always looking for action . And adventure . Hey , hey , listen . Ain 't safe to talk business on the street . Why don 't I take you boys back to my busy beehive ? Yes , ma 'am . All right , that 's it . I 'm through screwing around . Those two are so dead . Damn ! Well , ladies and gentlemen , we 've seen a great many wonderful achievements in science today . Our last presenter 's father is a legend in these hallowed halls , we all expect great things of him . I present to you , from the United States , Dr. Thaddeus Venture . Watch and learn , slim . Good evening . Since the dawn of time , man has strived to achieve greatness . He 's reached toward the heavens . He 's journeyed to the bottom of the seas . He 's built massive cities full of wonder and beauty . And above all , he 's sought to make peace with his brothers on this wondrous planet we call Earth . Well , today , mankind takes another small step toward achieving its ultimate goal . I present to you the oo-ray . U.N. Science Director : Dr. Venture , that is enough ! What do you think you 're doing ? I 'm showing everyone my new thing . What 's the matter ? I worked really hard on this . This is supposed to be a peaceful exhibition of scientific breakthroughs for the betterment of all mankind , and you show up with this--this- - this weapon of devastation . Weapon ? what are you talking about ? Then what the hell do you call it ? The oo-ray . I mentioned that . Why , the applications are limitless . Are you kidding me ? You blew up a model city with it . What are we supposed to think ? Look , it even melted all the little people and stuff , ohh Well , I suppose if it ever fell into the wrong hands , it could be modified and used as a weapon after a fashion . But that 's true of almost any technology . I can 't see anybody using Dr. Olafsen 's amazing hello helmet for ill . Ladies and gentlemen , I 'm terribly sorry we have to conclude our presentations on this note . Please , everyone , if you would adjourn to the next room , we 'll be having refreshments and cocktails . Thank you . Your clever boys aren 't here to protect your secret this time , Venture . Well , well , well , it looks as if these Venture boys are not quite so young and innocent as I thought . They seem to have already discovered the fleshy jig of the mommy and daddy dance . No matter , for as the monarch butterfly spins its deadly web , so shall I set my fiendish trap . Yo , coke , smoke , dope ? Uh . Oh . Ahem . No , I 'm cool . Ok , big fella , you first . I charge you 10 bucks for the gilded lily , 20 for the Roman holiday , 50 for the old walrus and carpenter , and for 75 you can sleigh ride down Kilimanjaro . Ma 'am ? Ok , tell you what . Why don 't we start nice and slow and get to know each other ? She touched me where I make sissy ! Aah ! Phbbt ! Ack ! Oh , sweet mama jama . Where are they , Monarch ? What 'd you do with the boys ? Wait a minute. wait , wait. ow. ow ! Aah ! Hey , look ! It 's the United Nations . Pop 's in there right now . Jiggy . Let 's go surprise him . Way to go , Venture . Yeah , smooth move , ex-lax . Oh , look who 's talking . I seem to remember a certain scientist inventing a little something called " the Albino Bomb " a few years back . Your hastily assembled cardboard diorama entitled " Where Does Rain Come From ? " was not exactly the highlight of these proceedings . Hey , guys , the surgeon general from Mexico is mixing up margaritas . Come on . Dad ! Boys , what the hell are you doing here ? Where 've you been ? We 've been on a bona fide New York adventure . We saw beautiful girls and ninjas and everything . Yes , yes. is Brock with you ? I wanna get the hell out of here , and I need him to pack up the oo-ray . Naw , Pop . We haven 't seen him . Very well . Then you two can help me . [ Grunting ] Mother of crap . Security ! Security ! He 's disappeared . No . He 's right there ! Nice work , boys . I 'm very sorry about this , Dr. Venture . Although it serves you right for bringing that thing in here . With all these foreigners around , someone 's bound to try to steal a weapon like that . Psh. weapon . He wasn 't trying to steal it . He was masturbating like a teenager with a fast internet connection . Master what ? Like an evil master plan ? No , boys , Otaku Senzuri isn 't evil . He 's a technology fetishist : A man who can only achieve full arousal when in the presence of high-tech equipment : Electronics , computers , undersea robots . That sort of thing . It 's only natural your dad 's work would have piqued his technological fancy . Fine technological doodad like this . Fine technological doodad ? You mean you like it ? We sure do , doc . The army will take 100 of them . Well , I don 't know what use the army will have for them , but it 's a deal , general . I 'd , uh , better get right to work on those . Well , looks like all 's well that ends well . Another successful adventure for the best family in the whole wide world . Go team Venture ! I suppose . But wait a minute . What happened to Brock ? Phew . That was some workout , big man . But I guess you 're gonna have to go look for those boys now , huh ? They 'll turn up . Besides , I still got $ 300 left . 3 bills can buy you an awful lot of things . And , uh , I 'm gonna want change . Someone did a real job on you , mister , but you 're gonna make it . Hard to believe , considering the size of this thing we pumped from your stomach . Don 't throw those out .

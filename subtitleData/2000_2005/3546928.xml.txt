 [ Groaning , Mumbling ] [ Screaming ] [ Hera ] Poor Callisto . Such rage unfulfilled . - Who are you ? - A fan . Your crusade against Xena was so vibrant . Too bad it had to end unsatisfied . Look at you . [ Laughs ] Hera ? Afraid to show your ugly face ? [ Laughs ] Your irreverence endears you to me , like a pet . What do you want ? To see you smile again . I offer you another chance to carry on your mission against Xena . - I 'm listening . - I 'll give you one more day of life ... and a chance at immortality . But if you fail , you 're back here forever . What do I have to do ? Kill my bastard stepson , the man who redeemed your mortal enemy . Hercules ? [ Laughs ] [ Man ] Nothing like the first day of spring , is there ? [ Iolaus ] Ah , what a beautiful day . Sun shining , nature blooming- - [ Gasps ] Nature blooming . [ Chuckles ] Come on , Hercules . Cheer up . It 's your birthday ! [ Sighs ] Don 't remind me . What is your problem ? You look great ... for a man of your age . What are you talking about ? You 're older than I am . Yeah , I know . But I 'm smaller , you see , so not as much surface area exposed to the elements . Hercules ! Iolaus ! Uh , let me be the first to extend my best wishes on this , your special day . Well , thanks , Falafel . I made a delicious cake for the party . - You like chocolate , yes ? - I love chocolate . What party ? Uh , the other great big party . Falafel- - Iolaus ? [ Falafel ] What 's the matter ? Iolaus , you don 't look so good . Yeah- - It was supposed to be a surprise . [ Gasps ] Oh , no . Oh , my sincerest apologies . I didn 't know . That 's okay . Neither did I. [ Clears Throat ] Yes , well . If you 'll excuse me , I must go stuff a chicken . [ Chicken Clucking , Squawking ] - Bye . - [ Whimpering ] Aw , come on , Herc . What 's one more birthday in a long line of birthdays ? [ Laughs ] You 're very funny today . Listen , Alcmene wanted to have a little celebration . I think it 'd be great , you know ? Um- - It 'd cheer you up . Look , I don 't mean to sound ungrateful , but ever since Hera destroyed my family , I 'm just not too excited ... about celebrating birthdays anymore . Yeah , well , I understand , but you know , you have to realize there are other people around who care for you , wanna celebrate with you- - Iphicles , your mother , me . Huh ? [ Chuckles ] Okay . There you go ! See ? Smiling . Little lines crinkle up round your eyes . Yeah , I better go . Yeah , you better . Oh , oh , so remember- - Alcmene 's at noon . And , uh , try to act surprised , okay ? I 'll act surprised . [ Sighs ] Wrinkles . You know , Hercules isn 't the easiest person to shop for . Yeah . You know , he gave away the present I got for him last year . [ Laughs ] Oh , yeah . Thank you . Do you think he 'll be surprised ? Oh , I 'm sure he will . Yeah , well , I certainly haven 't told anybody . I 'll get the food . [ Chuckling ] I hope he likes his presents . Hey , don 't worry about it , Mom . You 've done a great job . Everything looks beautiful , darling . Excuse me . I-I 'm sorry to intrude , but I couldn 't find a guard to announce me . We 're having a celebration . We sent them home for the day . Who are you ? I 've come to pay my respects . Last year , my family was attacked ... on the road to Macedonia . My husband was killed . My child and I , we would have surely died if Hercules hadn 't come along . Wait . Where 'd you say this was ? I 'd heard it was his birthday . I just wanted to leave a small gift . You poor dear . Come . Join us . Oh , no . I wouldn 't dream of imposing . Oh , please . You make yourself right at home . Now would you care for a drink ? Yes , thanks . [ Laughing ] Try one of these . Oh , they look great . Thank you , my friend . You 've outdone yourself , Falafel . Mmm . [ Chattering , Indistinct ] [ Fizzing ] [ Iphicles ] Make you in charge of all royal feasts . More punch , anyone ? [ Chuckles ] Uh , hello ? Is anybody here ? [ Scoffs ] " Act surprised . " Surprise . [ Laughs ] [ Man Narrating ] This is the story of a time long ago , a time of myth and legend , when the ancient gods were petty and cruel , and they plagued mankind with suffering . Only one man dared to challenge their power- - Hercules . Hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen , a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart . He journeyed the earth , battling the minions of his wicked stepmother , Hera , the all-powerful queen of the gods . But wherever there was evil , wherever an innocent would suffer , there would be ... Hercules . - [ Screeching ] - [ Roaring ] Hail ! Mother ! Mother ! Can you hear me ? My , my . Looks like somebody spiked the punch . Glad I don 't drink . You 've never witnessed the effects of Xanthalian venom before , have you ? It affects the mind- - makes the victims susceptible to their wildest imaginings . By sunset , your friends will be , um , driven mad . Well , that 's if they don 't kill each other first . There is an antidote , but it 's very rare . What do you want ? Safe passage through the Labyrinths of the Gods to the Tree of Life . One bite of the fruit cures any illness- [ Glass Breaking ] - or madness . And a whole one makes you immortal . We have so much to celebrate- - your birth and my rebirth . Oh . My name 's Callisto . Callisto ? Impossible . Callisto 's dead . Hera was kind enough to grant me one day 's reprieve . You see , we need each other , Hercules . I don 't have the strength to defeat the labyrinths ' traps , and ... you won 't find your way without me . Nice pants . You 're insane . Just misunderstood . Shall we go , partner ? After so little time together , it 's funny- - I feel like I know you . You don 't . The Fates brought us together . Although I have to admit , you 're not at all how I imagined you to be . How disappointing . Oh , not at all . On the contrary , I couldn 't be more pleased . That look back in your castle ? The fire and the hate ? I wonder , did you wear that same look when you watched your children die ? Don 't push me . Oh , but that 's the beauty of it- - I can . There 's a new and exciting side of you just waiting to come out . I can feel it . [ Gasping ] [ Groans ] Oh , what a party . Iolaus ! What happened ? I don 't know . Maybe it was the food . Hmm ? Mmm . Oh- - Oh , I heard that ! Jason ? Oh . [ Jason ] Are you all right ? [ Alcmene ] Yes . Look . [ Gurgling ] What 's goin ' on here ? [ Sniffs ] We 've been drugged . Everybody all right ? Where 's Hercules ? Uh , it looks like he 's been here . Oh , yeah ? Opened his presents while we slept ? I don 't think so . Who could 've done this ? That woman ! Where is she ? Something terrible has happened ! I just know it ! Let 's not jump to any conclusions . We 'll search the castle . I 'll go with Mother . Mm-hmm . Iolaus and I will take the west wing . Yeah . Eh- - What about me ? You stay here in case Hercules gets back . - By myself ? - If anything happens ... yell . Yell ? Wonderful ! [ Whimpering ] Big help ! [ Gasps ] Worms ? Ugh . Oh ! [ Shudders ] Wha-a-a- - Oh- - [ Sighs ] dd La-la , la-la-la dddd [ Sighs ] Cut it out ! [ Laughs ] Oh , now , now , Hercules . Just because I poisoned your friends doesn 't mean we can 't be nice to one another . [ Scoffs ] Amazing . [ Grunts ] You have no reason to be angry at me , Hercules . After all , I 'm not the one that hung the giant bull 's-eye on your family . - You leave my family out of this . - Oh , but think about it . I mean , well , if your children weren 't your children , well , then they 'd still be alive now , wouldn 't they ? Your love- - it 's a curse . Then what 's the alternative ? Be like you- - alone , trapped in your hate ? No . I 'd rather take my chances . [ Laughs ] Tell me , Hercules . Late at night , in the dark all alone , do you , uh- - do you hear your children screaming ? Do you lie awake at night , wondering if there was something else you could 've done ? Maybe if you had gotten there a little sooner , been a little bit more respectful to Hera ? Drop it ! I wouldn 't expect someone like you to understand . Oh , but I do understand . My family was slaughtered like helpless animals as well ! You didn 't learn much from it . I learned to get exactly what I want when I want it ! And you realize , Hercules , theonlyreason your friends are still alive , is because Ihave allowed it ! And I suppose I owe you thanks ? Oh , no . You owe me all . This is my fault . I should never have let that stranger in . Hercules is a big boy . He can take care of himself . I know you 're right . I just so wanted this to be a special day for him . Oh-Oh , I 'll bet you did . After all , he 's Corinth 's most famous son . You know what ? Maybe I 'll declare a holiday in his name . That make you feel better ? Why are you talking like this ? Because he has brought nothingbut trouble to my kingdom . Well , how can you say that ? He 's your brother . Oh , yeah . We 're one big happy family ! Tell me something , Mother . Who ensures your safety every single day ? Hmm ? And where 's Hercules through all this ? He graces us with his presence when he 's not too busy saving the world . Oh , please , Iphicles . Y-You 're-You 're not yourself . Wrong ! I 'm just not who you want me to be ! You think Hercules should 've been king . Well , there can only be one king ! And nobody but nobody is gonna change that ! Not even you . [ Groans ] [ Gasps ] I 'm surrounded by infidels ! [ Objects Crashing ] [ Shouts ] Mother . It 's going to be all right . Oh , it 's beautiful . [ Sighs ] Well , an open door is like a friendly invitation . [ Creaking ] [ Screams ] Y-You were saying ? All who seek passage must first answer my riddle . Fail , and you will die . Care to be first ? Give a name to this earthly conceit . It is unchangeable , but it can change you . It can teach you or trap you . All who reside there are immortal , but you can never go there . I hope you 're as smart as you are strong ! The answer lies before your eyes . [ High-pitched Tone ] Choose your words before the sands run their course . [ Creaking ] [ Callisto ] It 's unchangeable . " All who reside in it are immortal . " It 's Mount Olympus ! It 's not a place . That 's the trick . I don 't see you coming up with anything . If you 'd be quiet , maybe I could think . Well , I won 't be holding my breath for that now , will I ? Oh , we 're running out of time ! Maybe that 's it . Oh , yes , of course . It 's time ! Well , that didn 't work . Any more brilliant ideas ? Well , answer ! - [ Laughs ] - [ Whimpering ] [ Groaning ] " The answer lies before your eyes . " Time is running out . The past ! Huh . After you . Hercules ? I 've come to say good-bye . Good-bye ? I 've crossed over to the other side . It 's all my fault . I should 've protected you . It 's too late for that now . No ! This- - This can 't be . I never wanted to be a hero , Mother , but you didn 't give me any choice . There was no other way for this to end . Please- - Please forgive me . Perhaps , in time . Good-bye . Wait ! Let me come with you , please . I was hoping you 'd say that . Ah . There 's an oil pouch . We 'll use it to keep the lamp lit . Mmm . Poor baby . Afraid of the dark ? [ Laughs ] You don 't look like you 're doing too well . Oh , don 't you worry your pretty little head about me . I 'll be as good as new soon enough . [ Groans ] In the meantime , a little water should do the trick . [ Groaning , Straining ] Here . [ Panting ] [ Slurps ] Hmm . Mmm . Ahh . Such a gentleman . Yeah . The world doesn 't deserve you . It doesn 't deserve you either . [ Laughs ] We 're not as different as you 'd like to think . Oh , really ? We both believe the wicked should be punished , only I see something you don 't . Yeah . I 'm sure you 'll let me know what it is , won 't you ? [ Pops Top ] All people are wicked , and they deserve everything they 're gonna get . I 've known too much good in the world to believe that . Good ? Is that supposed to be some kind of joke ? If mortals were good , well , then we wouldn 't need you around , would we ? You 've seen the darkest side of people . A child who watched her parents die has my compassion . But you had a choice . You chose evil . And that 's where my compassion ends . [ Clapping ] Your faith in the world is touching . Let 's see how well it holds up at the end of the day . Shall we ? Anything ? No , not a sign of him . Now what ? Oh , it 's hotter than Tartarus in here . You know , I-I got a bad feeling about this . Let 's go back . Wait . Wait . Wait . Wh-What 's wrong ? You ever get a feeling that your- - your life is just ebbing away ? You 're kinda getting out of step with things , and , I don 't know , there 's nothin you can do about it ? Did you hear that ? What ? I don 't hear anything . What ? Shh , shh ! There it is again . I can 't hear anything . I 'll be right back . Jason ? Ja- - Jason , wait . Jason ! Where are you ? Ah-Ah ! [ Laughing ] [ Slurps ] Mmm . Oh ! dddd [ Humming ] - [ Grunts ] - Ah , King Iphicles ! Just in time . Uh , would you be so kind as to hand me that bowl of turnips ? [ Inhales Sharply ] What are you talkin ' about ? There 's nothin ' there ! [ Laughs ] Are you blind ? I 'll get it myself . So little time , so much to cook ! [ Laughs ] Hot stuff . Watch the tongue . I 'm warning you ! Be honest . You won 't hurt my feelings . I want everything to be perfect when Hercules arrives . It 's his birthday , you know . A surprise . Not a word to anyone . [ Giggles ] Traitor ! What did you do that for ? [ Shouts ] Huh ! [ Screams ] [ Sighs ] King Iphicles ? He didn 't like my stew . You 're not living up to my expectations . I imagined you 'd spend the day trying to convince me ... that I can change like our beloved Xena . Xena changed because she wanted to . Did she now ? You know she watched me die . It 's ironic , you know . I mean , not long ago , you would 've joined me in bringing her down . Wrong . Our definitions of justice aren 't the same . Oh , true . That 's very true . I believe she deserves to die a very slow and painful death . Vengeance isn 't justice . If you understood that , maybe you 'd find peace . Peace ? Peace ? I dreamed of peace . I imagined it . Let me die so I can find it . Tartarus should 've been a welcome change . Instead , I learned the true meaning of torture- - trapped in my hatred with nothing to do . Lady , immortality won 't solve your problem . [ Hisses ] Jason , where 'd you go ? Jason ? Jason . Jason ! Jason ! [ Panting ] [ Laughing , Chattering ] [ Laughs ] [ Laughs ] [ Woman ] Hello . We 've been waiting for you , Iolaus . - [ Moaning ] You can 't resist our charms . - [ Iolaus Laughing ] And we can 't resist yours . [ Inhales , Moans ] Please , don 't leave us waiting . Iolaus . [ Sighs ] Don 't tell me . We 're lost . I can 't seem to- - Left or right- - There 's just so many details . I knew I should 've written it down . I think- - Great . Hmm . No , no , no . It 's left . [ Screams ] Hercules ! I guess it was right . [ Screaming Continues ] [ Groaning , Screaming ] Looks like I 'm in a real bind . Callisto ! [ Echoing ] I 'm right here ! - Callisto ! Keep talking ! - That 's what I 'm trying to do ! [ Echoing ] I 'm over here ! Hercules , hurry ! [ Grunts ] Your friends ! If I die , they die ! [ Screams ] They die ! Hercules ! Hercules ! [ Straining , Gagging ] [ Straining , Gagging Continues ] Hercules ! Hurry ! [ Choking ] [ Growling ] [ Grunts ] [ Screams ] [ Screams ] [ Growling ] Callisto , hold on ! [ Grunts ] [ Screaming ] [ Gasps ] Grab on ! [ Grunts ] Oh , my hero . Yeah , right . [ Squealing ] [ Grunts ] [ Howls ] [ Sighing ] [ Women Murmuring ] Come on , Iolaus . [ Laughing ] Come with us . [ Laughing ] Come this way , Iolaus . Mmm . [ Giggles ] Catch me if you can . [ Giggles ] Hey ! [ Both Laughing ] [ Man ] Jason . [ Panting ] [ Woman Moans ] [ Man Laughing ] Oh , come on , baby . Just one more for old times ' sake ? [ Laughing ] [ Grunting ] [ Panting ] [ Gasping ] [ Scoffs ] You 're- - You 're me ? [ Gasping ] [ Cackling ] Oh ! No ! Come here , handsome . [ Squishing Sounds ] Let me take a look at that pretty young face of mine . [ Cackles ] [ Groaning ] - [ Cackling ] - [ Screams ] [ Pants ] What 's going on ? Jason ! [ Shouts ] Jason ! [ Panting ] [ Gasping ] Where are you ? [ Maniacal Laughter ] I think the first thing I 'm gonna do is find the good Xena ... and rip out her tongue , just to hear her whistle an apology ! I hate to spoil your fantasy , but you 're not out of here yet . Oh , but neither are you . When we make it to the Tree of Life , and when I save my family and friends , you are going back to where you belong . I 'll see to that myself . Enough ! No rooms can hold me . Haven 't you figured that out yet ? You 're the only one that can stop me , and to do that , you 'd have to kill me . But you can 't . Your misguided sense of justice won 't allow it . You 're overlooking something . [ Scoffs ] Oh , am I ? You 've already been killed . The only reason you 're still standing is because I need directions . I 've underestimated you . I 'm flattered . Fortunately , you 've overlooked something as well . [ Chuckles ] I don 't think so . If I go back to the underworld , I won 't be suffering alone . I 'll find your children . Klonus , Aeson and little Ilea , is it ? And I 'll dedicate eternity to making them suffer . I mean , after all , I got here , didn 't I ? I can get to them . That 's it . That 's the spirit . Kill me . I dare you . [ Gasps ] [ Groans ] [ Gasps ] [ Laughs ] Who 's trapped in their hatred now ? [ Laughs ] [ Groans ] [ Screams ] [ Old Iolaus 's Voice ] Thought you could sneak up on me , did ya ? I 'm going to kill you . [ Cackles ] I 'm gonna kill you ! [ Cackling ] - [ Shouts ] - [ Screams ] Aah ! We 're almost at the other side , Mother . But Jason and Iphicles- - They 'll be joining us soon . [ Sighs ] Then we 'll all be together again . Yes . [ Sighs ] Don 't tell me you 're confused again . Oh , no , I 'm- - I 'm quite certain it 's this way . [ Door Screeching ] [ Shouts ] [ Groaning ] [ Groaning ] Oh , um , I lied . [ Panting ] Lovely detail . Hephaestus is quite the craftsman . Hera ! Hercules delivered , as promised . I fulfilled my end of the bargain . It 's your turn . [ Stone Door Opening ] It 's not over yet ! Hercules . I have enjoyed our little time together . But you know , I think I can take it from here . [ Groans ] [ Shouts ] [ Groans ] [ Groans ] [ Giggles ] Oh , are we having fun yet ? Oh , look at the bright side . You 'll be reunited with your friends soon enough . Oh , and this- - this is for Xena . [ Groans ] Good-bye , Hercules . [ Straining ] Mmm . Hmm . [ Laughs Softly ] [ Grunts ] [ Shouts ] [ Kiaiing ] [ Screams ] - Delicious . [ Yells ] - [ Groans ] [ Grunts ] [ Inhales ] Oh , you 're gonna die on your birthday . - How convenient . - [ Groans ] [ Laughing ] No ! Blow it out and make a wish . [ Kiaiing ] [ Yells ] It 's a pity we couldn 't work out our differences . We would 've made an unstoppable team . [ Shouts ] [ Grunts ] - I already have a partner . [ Shouts ] - [ Shouts ] [ Grunts ] [ Laughs ] Not for long . [ Growling ] [ Screaming ] [ Screaming ] Why can 't you just die like a good boy ? I guess I don 't know when to quit . Well , let me inspire you . Even if you could find your way without me , you won 't make it in time to save your friends . That 's where you 're wrong . I know something you don 't . [ Laughs ] Oh ? We 're out of oil . - [ Gasps ] - That leads right back to the entrance . - Surprise ! - [ Gasps ] [ Grunts ] [ Screams ] [ Crying ] [ Sobbing ] Oh , don 't- - don 't leave ! Please , don 't leave ! I can 't see ! Here . Give me your hand ! [ Screaming ] [ Grunting ] Huh ! [ Grunts ] [ Callisto ] No . [ Screaming ] No ! No ! [ Screams ] Must find meat . [ Laughing ] [ Grunts ] [ Groaning ] Aaahh . [ Panting ] [ Straining ] Falafel ! Come on ! Give me a hand ! Get this off ! [ Oinking ] [ Squealing ] Here , piggy , piggy , piggy ! Falafel , what are you doing ? [ Laughing ] [ Oinking , Squealing ] [ Shouts , Laughs ] [ Groans , Shouts ] - [ Squeals ] - [ Falafel Hits Ground ] [ Screams ] [ Whimpering ] My turn . This is it , Mother . Right up here . - [ Laughs ] - [ Screams ] Jason ! - Don 't . - [ Laughs , Grunts ] [ Grunts ] [ Grunts ] [ Groaning ] - Hercules ? - [ Sighs ] - Hercules ? - Don 't talk with your mouth full . [ Falafel Screams ] [ Whimpering ] [ Shouts ] [ Whimpering ] [ Shouts ] [ Shouting ] [ Straining , Mumbling ] [ Laughs ] - You 'll thank me later . - [ Growls ] [ Mumbling ] [ Laughing ] [ Gagging , Groaning ] Give me that . Here . Have you seen my mother ? No , we haven 't seen her . All right . Give them each a bite . Why ? [ Stammers ] Trust me . [ Mumbles ] [ Groans ] - [ Growls ] - [ Gagging ] [ Growling ] One more step , and we 'll be together forever . I 'm coming , Hercules . I love you . I love you too , Mother . What kind of trick is this ? He- - He looks like you . Mother , I- - I 'm right here . No . My son is dead . I 'm not . [ Gasps ] [ Sighs ] Oh , Mother . [ Sighs ] Hercules ? Does this mean I 'm not going to the underworld ? U- - No . Not yet . Uh , here . I- - I- - brought something for you . Oh ! For me ? Yeah . Oh , you shouldn 't have . Oh , Hercules . Now where have you been ? I 've been worried sick . Mother , it has been a very , very long day . I 'll tell you about it later . Let 's go find the others , okay ? Mm-hmm . Hey-Hey ! I 'm sorry you missed your birthday . [ Jason ] Uh , the day 's not over yet . [ Falafel ] We still have cake . Yeah , and you gotta open all your presents . Oh , that reminds me . There was a- - a woman here earlier . Poor thing . Uh , she wanted to leave you a gift . Well , she did . She made me appreciate my family more than ever . [ All Laughing ]

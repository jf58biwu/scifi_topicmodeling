All suspects are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law . Yeah , I don 't know what it is about a full moon . It 's just , uh ... There 's something about it . People just go off the wall . These are some pretty scary neighborhoods to begin with . I haven 't been on the job that long myself , but I 've seen more than my fair share of crazy stuff . When the moon is full , it 's just like times ten . I don 't know , uh ... I don 't know . Maybe it 's the tides or something . But irregardless , we 're on the job . And if that makes people breathe a little easier knowing we 're out there ... or being a little less nervous walking the streets at night , well , that 's a good feeling . Okay . We got a report of somebody lurking around the neighborhood making noise . Actually , I take that back . We got a report of a ... a monster lurking around the neighborhood . What ... Hey , it 's a full moon . A lot of drug activity in this district . We 're probably looking at somebody rattling ' doorknobs ... trying to steal some money for a quick fix . Usually , they 're not the stealthiest of criminals , so maybe we 'll get lucky , sneak up on ' em . 212-Adam is 10-97 . 212-Adam is 10-97 at 543 Vogel . 212-Adam to Dispatch . I don 't see anything . Can you let the lady know inside her house ... know I 'm out here ? 212-Adam , copy your request . Calling now . - Figures , doesn 't it ? Psst ! A lot of scratches . Maybe a big dog 's probably what she saw . Sheriff s Department ! Uh ... - Senora ? Man , she 's scared of somethin ' . - Hey , you , there ! You , freeze ! Sheriff s Department ! Freeze ! Sheriff s Department ! Run ! Run to the car ! Back to the car , now ! Now ! Run ! Run , Run ! - Now ! Now ! Come on ! Get up ! Go , go , go ! Back to the car ! Come on ! Run ! Run ! Get in the car ! Get in the car ! Holy Come on ! - 10-33 ! 10-33 ! Patrol Adam needs assistance ! I need assistance at the 500 block of Vogel ! I need assistance ! I need ... 9-9-9 ! 9-9-9 ! Everybody all right ? Hey , you all right ? You all right ? Keith . What was this ? I was responding to a 9-21 at this house right here , and , uh ... - It was a prowler call . - You flipped it ? No , no . Hell , no , I didn 't ... I didn 't flip it . It was ... We were parked . The ... We were attacked . - By who ? By gangbangers ? - Uh ... - Keith ? - Yeah . Yeah , it was ... it was gangbangers . Okay . Fan out and search . Hey , you 'd better double everybody up . Okay , hold on a minute . Uh , everybody double up . Set up a command post and check on that air shift . How many ? Keith ? Keith ? Um , you know , I didn 't get a good look . Maybe ... 4-17 suspects on foot just one block north of Holly . Armed suspects ! Bring some units around side Holly Street ! Get your hands up ! Get your hands up ! We 're the F.B.I. ! - Turn around ! - I 've got I.D. in my back pocket ! - We 're investigating a case ! - Hands behind your head ! - Check the I.D. ! Hands behind your head ! Check my I.D. in the back pocket . They 're both F.B.I. Give ' em back their guns . - Thank you . - We 're investigating a case . - What case ? - Same case you 're working on . - So who we looking for ? - Not " who . " What . - Mulder , what the hell is going on here ? - I don 't know . - You okay ? You all right ? - See the claw marks here ? - You okay ? You all right ? - See the claw marks here ? Someone tried to get in . Hey , Deputy ? Deputy , can you describe for me what you saw ? Um ... Well , I mean , it 's pretty dark , and I-I didn 't really see . - I don 't know what ... I don 't know . - You must 've seen something ... in order to run away from it . Huh ? You were responding to the same call we were ... of a monster prowling the neighborhood . We 've been to this house before . The lady has a history of medication . - You know what I mean ? - Yeah , maybe . But she 's not the only one seeing monsters . There 's been half a dozen such sightings in this area in the past 60 days . Were you aware of that ? - No . - Yeah . Also , these sightings only occur on nights when there 's a full moon , - Which tells me something . - What ? What you saw was large , right ? Maybe seven , eight feet tall ... when it stood up on its two legs , and it was covered in fur ... and had glowing red eyes and claws ... claws sharp enough to gouge the wood off that front door . - You 're not serious ? - And dare I forget teeth ? It bit you , didn 't it ? Yeah , look at that . Deputy , how long were you gonna hide that from the E.M.T. s ? - I don 't ... - Where 'd you get that , Keith ? I don 't even know where that came from . I mean , I didn 't see anything that he 's talking about . Big teeth , eight feet tall . - What the hell are you describing ? - A werewolf . - Excuse me ? - It 's what did that . It also attacked one Hymen Escallera 29 days ago during the last full moon . Hymen died of his wounds in Compton General Hospital , but not before giving a detailed description of what attacked him . My partner and I are here to catch it . Unfortunately , though , Deputy , you 've been bitten . The skin is broken . Werewolf law pretty much universally holds that ... someone who 's been bitten by such a creature is gonna become such a creature himself . - So ... - Wait a minute . I mean ... But see , that 's not really what happened , though . I 'm sorry , but you 're gonna have to be isolated and kept under guard . With all due respect , what the are you talkin 'about ? I 'm talking about preventing this man from becoming a danger to himself and to others . - Can I see your badge again ? - Agent Mulder ? Can we have a word a second ? Excuse me . What is it ? What is it ? Mulder , have you noticed that we 're on television ? I don 't think it 's live television , Scully . She just said But it 's a camera , and it 's recording . It 's recording everything that you are saying . Do you understand that ? I just wanna make sure that you 're clear on that . Sure , I 'm clear on that , Scully . My point being , Mulder , that we are on a case . Well , this presents an opportunity . I feel we 're very close here . And the possibility of capturing concrete proof of the paranormal ... of a werewolf in front of a national audience , even an international audience ... - What 's not to love ? - Well ... Look , Mulder , you wanna talk about werewolves to me , you can knock yourself out . I may not agree with you , but at least I 'm not gonna hold it against you . But this ... Mulder , this could ruin your career . What career ? Scully , I appreciate it . You don 't want me looking foolish . I do . I appreciate that . I don 't want me looking foolish , Mulder . Okay , fine . Well , do me a favor . Will you just escort Deputy Wetzel to the hospital ? Just keep an eye on him in case I 'm right ? Thank you . - I 'm gonna call Skinner , Mulder . - Okay . I 'm sure he 's gonna wanna say a couple words about this . Guys , give it a rest , huh ? She says , uh ... I guess she 's calling it a claw monster ... was trying to break into the house and get her . Uh , it was big and had claws pretty much . Keeps going on and on . Yeah , all right . Tell her to describe it in detail to the sketch artist . - Will you work with her ? Yeah . - Claw monster ? - Just do it , Ricky . - Okay . Hey , look at that . Excuse me . Look at this . It 's like five claw marks . Just like the human hand has five fingers . Pretty much the same spread too . - Agent , you seriously believe ... - Huh ? we 're lookin ' for some kind of a ... I 'll show you . This . This is what Hymen Escallera described ... just before succumbing to his injuries . Ten to one , that 's what Mrs. Guerrero 's gonna describe too . Sir ? Sir ? We got your suspect . Claw monster ! Claw monster ! Claw monster . Boy , you know , they kill him in every movie , and he just keeps coming back . - Now , this is ... this is strange . - Mm-hmm . Gracias , Mrs. Guerrero . We 're lookin ' for gangbangers . Um , you don 't think it 's some guy dressed up like Freddy Krueger , do you ? Can somebody walk me to my car ? It 's dark out , and I 'm parked up the street . Yeah , come on , Ricky . I 'll walk you to your car . - Can I return this vest later ? - Yeah , you can return the vest later . - This is what she was tellin ' ... - That 's what she 's saying . That 's the claw monster . You catch ? - Catch-Catch him ? - Si . Si . You catch . How 's Deputy Wetzel ? - You let him get released ? - Well , those weren 't teeth marks , Mulder . They turned out to be insect bites . Individual welts or stings of some sort . Together , they just look like a larger pattern , especially when we want them to . Although , it was an understandable conclusion ... that I 'm sure anybody would have made . So what did Skinner say ? He said that the F.B.I. has nothing to hide , and neither do we . If it makes you feel any better , I 'm not entirely convinced ... that we 're looking for a werewolf anymore . - Oh . All right . Good . - Yeah , it 's something else . I 'm not sure what . Some other kind of creature though . - I have a ... Hey , what 's going on ? Six blocks from here . Could be what we 're looking for . No . You go with someone else . Man down at the corner of ... Guys , watch out . I 'm a doctor . Oh , man , it 's Ricky . That 's what I was afraid of , Scully . When a fellow officer goes down in the line of duty , or even if it 's ... even if it 's not a fellow officer ... if it 's just somebody working part-time with the department ... in a support , uh ... artistic capacity ... like Ricky there ... we all feel it . Uh , that there is every cop 's worst nightmare . But that 's when you gotta cowboy up and give 150 percent ... and catch the bad guys . Last call from his phone was made to the Road Club . Ricky called in requesting roadside assistance for his flat tire . He asked them to hurry . He said he didn 't feel safe . - What 's that ? - Our suspect , apparently . - The slash marks match up pretty well , wouldn 't you say ? Somebody lost a nail . Nice color . Check out this color , Mulder . Blood red . Hey , uh , who called 911 on this ? - Steve and Edy ? Sergeant Paula . The Steve and Edy ? They 're good folk . They usually call us if there 's trouble in the neighborhood . - Ooh . - Oh , my God ! Look at this ! - Look at all these people . Lord ! - How are you doin ' this evening ? - We fine . - Can y 'all tell us what happened out here ? Not with me lookin like this . Mm-mmm . Now , you should know better than that , Sergeant Paula ! Like she gonna run from a camera . Look it here . We heard all this screaming ' , peeked out the window , and this boy with crazy hair was having a conniption fit ... all rolled up there by the phone . You didn 't see his ... his attacker ? - Mmm . - I 'm ready for my close-up . Ain 't nobody care about your scabby ass . This is police business . - What ? - Now , I didn 't see ... - What 'd you say ? Attacker ? - Attacker . - No , he was just kind of all rolled up and yellin ' . - Mm-hmm . Did you see anything ... that looked like this ? - Ooh , stop ! - Or this ? - Ooh ! Excuse me ? - That 's gonna give me nightmares . - So you didn 't see anything at all ? - Uh-uh . No . Did you , uh ... Did you see a woman ? - Mmm . Mm-hmm . - Mm-hmm . - Chantara . I know that skanky-ass color anywhere . - Mm-hmm . - Sure do . - Chantara a streetwalker ? - Mm-hmm . She work the corner . - Mm-hmm . - She on the pipe , so we don 't associate . - Oh , yeah . - Mm-mmm . No . - You know what I 'm sayin ' ? Well , we should go ... We should go talk to Chantara then . - Well , I wish you would . Mm-hmm . - That 's right . Hey ! Hey ! When I 'm a-get my own TV show ? - If I didn 't care - Oh , she 's showin ' off now . - More than words can say - Stop ! Stop ! Get in there ! Stop this ! - Would you excuse us ? Excuse us . - If I didn 't care Get in there ! Stop this ! Bye , y 'all . Bye . So apparently , we 're on the lookout ... for someone whose hair matches her fingernails . Bubblegum pink . That would be a good color for you , Scully . I 'd have to say that at this point in the investigation , I 'm-I 'm usually a little more secure ... in-in what it is we 're actually investigating . But we 've had so many conflicting eyewitness reports ... that it 's hard to ascertain exactly what it is we 're looking for . But the crimes we are investigating are ... are paranormal . I can say that ... with absolute conviction . And the nature of these crimes , they 're-they 're notoriously hard to quantify ... in any kind of rigorous scientific level , as Agent Scully will tell you . - Oh , yeah . - Yeah , which in its own way ... is a kind of a validation , if you think about it , in and of itself . But , you know , that 's our job . That 's why they pay us the big bucks . Bubblegum pink . - Don 't run ! F.B.I. ! - Chantara Gomez ? - Chantara ... - Chantara Gomez ? - Don 't run ! It 's okay . - It 's okay . - It 's all right . - Chantara Gomez ? - Can I see your hands , please ? - I didn 't do nothing ! - Can I see your hands , please ? It 's okay . - We need to see your hands . - Show her your hands . Earlier this evening , a man was attacked . He was badly slashed . And do you realize that this places you at the crime scene ? Fisher and Delmont . That 's your usual hang , isn 't it , Chantara ? Look , I heard screaming , okay ? And I went and I tried to help this guy . And when I heard the sirens , I just ran away , okay ? I didn 't do nothing ! Look , I believe you . I think you saw something . You witnessed something . Tell me what it is . - I can 't . - You can tell us , Chantara . - Come on . It 's okay . - Chantara . If you 're afraid that what you tell us , we 're not gonna believe it , don 't be . So whatever it is you saw tonight , whatever it is , whatever you think you saw , however strange or terrifying or bizarre , you are not gonna surprise me . Okay ? You 'll protect me from Chuko ? - Who 's Chuko ? - Mi novio . He 's the one who cut that guy up , not me ! I didn 't do anything ! - I 'm sorry . What ? - Mi novio . Her boyfriend . No , I got that . Look , he 's been chasing me for a week , okay ? He said he was gonna twist my neck off like a little chicken if I didn 't give him more money . - Chuko . - Chuko Munos . The cops know who he is . This is my favorite part of the job ... knockin ' down crack houses . I heard that . I don 't understand . I told you everything you need to know ! - Chantara , first of all , - I just wanna go home now ! you are not out of the woods yet as far as possible accessory charges , all right ? - Chuko 's the one you want ! - So the sooner we find him , the sooner we can let you go . He 's gonna kill me ! You don 't understand ! He 's gonna kill me ! He told me he was gonna twist my neck off like a chicken ! Chantara , no one 's gonna kill you . - He 's gonna kill me ! - Chantara , look around ... look around you ! You see all the deputies here ? You see ? No one is going to get you . - Now , what 's more , Deputy Wetzel here ... is going to keep an eye on you while we go and put the cuffs on Chuko . No one is going to get you . Chuko Munos . The man himself . Only distinguishing feature is a tattoo on his skull . - He 's not our guy . - What do you mean ? I don 't care how bad his rep is , he can 't turn over a squad car . Maybe not by himself , but he 's probably got friends , right ? There 's something else going on . Let 's hit it . Units on a warrant . Let 's hold all radio traffic . Go , go , go ! Hands above your head ! Get your hands above your head ! - Clear above your head ! - Let 's see your hands ! - Have you seen Chuko Munos ? - you , mother ... [ Bleep ] Put your hands on the wall ! On the wall ! Get your hands off me . Oh , man . Agents ! Agents , in here . Hey , what happened ? Wake up . - What happened to your friend in there ? - Check the tattoo . - Looks like he O.D. ' d . - Yeah , but how long ago ? Couple days . Maybe a week . He didn 't attack Ricky Kola , that 's for sure . - Shots fired ! - It 's here ! - What ? - It 's gettin 'away ! - What you got ? What you shooting at ? What are you shooting at ? Keith , what are you doin ' ? It came back . It was here . - It-It was here . - Keith ! Oh , man . I heard her screamin ' , and I tried to ... I tried to stop it . I swear to you , I tried . - I did everything I could do . - Oh , sh ... I did everything I could do . What is it , Mulder ? What ... - Call it in . - 212-40 , I have a possible 9-27 . I wish someone would explain to me what the hell is going on here . It just doesn 't make sense . Keith Wetzel may be a little green , but he is a solid deputy . Nothing could 've gotten past him and killed that woman . There 's no sign of what he was shooting at . This is all we found . Nine millimeter . It 's our issue . - Where did you find that ? - It was lying in the middle of the street . Doesn 't look like a ricochet . Maybe Wetzel hit what he was aiming at . Excuse me . Hey , Deputy . You ready to talk to me now ? You and I both know you saw something . We 're way past claiming you didn 't . I only know what I thought I saw . Well , describe it for me . The Wasp Man . The Wasp Man ? - It 's ridicu ... It 's ridiculous . Scary stories my older brother used to tell me when I was a kid ... about a monster , head like a wasp ... and a mouth full of stingers instead of teeth . He said that it would come get me in my sleep , and that ... and that it would sting me to death . So you 're saying that the Wasp Man attacked you both times ... - Here and earlier in the patrol car ? - I ... I 'm not saying that that 's what it was , okay ? I mean , they didn 't see it . It 's not on the videotape . This-This can 't be real . No , I think maybe it can . Just relax a minute . Excuse me . Scully , we came on this case lookin ' for a werewolf , right ? No , you did . That 's correct . Hymen Escallera claimed he was attacked by a werewolf , and the wounds that he sustained would seem to bear that out , right ? And then , uh , Wetzel over here sees a wasp man ... with stingers for teeth , and he gets a bite mark ... that you say is irrefutably insect-like , right ? Mulder , that 's not exactly ... And another eyewitness claims she sees Freddy Krueger . Scully , what if ... what if we 're dealing with one creature , one entity , that when it attacks appears to you as your worst nightmare ? Fear . Maybe that 's what this thing feeds on . - Okay , well , for the sake of this argument , - Yeah ? how would one catch something like that ? Probably by ... by figuring out how it chooses its prey . I mean , they 're ... It seems to spread like a contagion . One person 's fear becomes the next . There 's a definite chain of victims . Tonight it went from Mrs. Guerrero to Wetzel and the sketch artist . And then from the sketch artist to Chantara Gomez . - And then ... Right . - Chantara Gomez back to Wetzel . - But you 're missing someone , Mulder . - Who ? Edy . Steve and Edy . They 're a part of this chain too . And according to your theory , they would 've been attacked , right ? So we 're back at the home of Steve and Edy . We should probably check on them because they seem to fit a victim profile . I 'm sorry . Are you talking to me ? - Shut up ! What 's going on with you ? - Hey ! What the hell are ... What the hell is this ? Steve , are you gonna be all right ? - I 'm all right . Somebody ask if I 'm all right . ! I 'm the victim ! I 'm the victim here ! He don 't treat me right . - All right . - You better appreciate me , or I 'll walk ! - The hell you would ! - We 're not here to get involved in any kind of personal ... He treats my mama with disrespect ! He treats me with disrespect ! - Oh , shut up ! - We 're not here to get involved with personal problems . - See ? You ! You shut up ! - Settle down . He won 't make love to me . Oh . Uh ... - I should have never touched your stupid ass ! - All right . - Oh , no , no ! - Look , you guys . Steve , Edy , the reason why we are here ... is because we are concerned about your safety . - How 's that ? - We 're concerned about your lives . You witnessed a violent attack right across the street from your house . So you say ! I just saw a rolled up boy with crazy hair ! Well , take our word for it . Because of your proximity to the attack , we think you may be targeted as well . - Why ? Because we called the police ? - No , no , no . That 's not why . I can 't really explain it exactly , but ... I think the key is to remain unemotional , okay ? Try to stay calm . Try to keep your heart rate down . Try to keep your adrenaline down . Try to ... - Just try to relax . - Oh , no ! Good luck ! You don 't know who you 're talkin 'to about that ! Oh , you ! Yeah , I think maybe we should stay here for a little while . All right , let 's just ... let 's just ... let 's just , uh , relax . Just relax . Mr. Mulder , lookee here . I got to go to bed . How ya doin ' , Edy ? You still upset ? I 'm scared . You 're scared ? I 'm scared he 's gonna leave me . Oh ! No , man . No . You think we should take ' em to a hotel ? - We don 't need no hotel . - Mm-mmm . - We 've been livin ' in this house for 17 years . - Oh , yeah . - Ain 't nobody gonna chase us out . - Mm-mmm . - You 're not afraid ? - Now , I didn 't say that . I said ain 't nobody gonna chase us out . - Mm-mmm . - No . Oh , God . More of you ? - Are we any closer to an arrest ? - I 'm afraid not . - Mulder , what next ? - Well , I 'd say ... we should station a couple deputies out here , but I don 't think it 's coming back here . We 're just playing catch-up with this thing . It doesn 't do what you 'd expect . And , uh ... Well , we got four or five hours till the moon sets . The attacks only occur on a full moon . Then we 're out of luck . Well , I want to examine Chantara Gomez . - For a possible contagion ? - Your contagion of fear ? - Yeah . No ? - No . But if I can 't figure out what this thing was , at least I can figure out what it wasn 't . Make it fast . And fill that tank up with gas . Uh , Deputy , you 're the only person that 's seen this twice , so I 'd like to ride with you if you don 't mind . - Let 's go . - Thanks . You really believe me , huh ? You really believe I saw what I thought I saw ? Yeah , I believe you . - Why ? - Why do I believe you ? Yeah , I mean , what proof do you have what I 'm saying is real ? I mean , it 's not ... it 's not on the videotape . The camera doesn 't always tell the whole story . And what about your partner ? Does she believe me ? I don 't think she thinks you 're lying . Yeah , but what ? Maybe I 'm crazy ? I 've been on the job 18 months . It 's all I ever wanted to do . Right out of the gate , I get some kind of rep like I 'm crazy . I mean , you know how cops are . How 's somebody supposed to live that down ? I don 't know . I guess just do good work . I mean , it 's a hard enough job already , you know ? You want to help people , but it 's like the freakin ' wild west out here . You know people hate you ? Every shift I go out thinkin ' ... Go ahead . I go out thinkin ' , " You know , there is somebody out there ... " who wants to take me out . Am I gonna run into him tonight ? " It 's hard to have a fast-track career in law enforcement ... when everybody thinks you 're nuts . Tell me about it . Chantara Gomez , age 31 . Apparent cause of death is the fracturing ... of the second and third cervical vertebrae . There are contusions consistent with a choking ... or a throttling by very powerful hands . People are saying her pimp killed her from beyond the grave . That 's the story going around . It 's crazy , huh ? Well , let 's see if we can put that story to rest , shall we ? The other thing I heard was , uh , something about contagion . - Like , with this body ? That 's-That 's completely inaccurate . It 's , uh ... The investigation is ... We 're moving towards an apparent chain of victims . And I seriously doubt that we 're gonna find anything ... that looks like a contagious pathology here . Because , I mean , if we were , we should be taking precautions . If the body could be contagious , you ... We 're not even wearing masks . Look , this is obviously a murder here . I mean , this woman died of a broken neck , right ? Not the hantavirus . - Who said anything about the hantavirus ? - Nobody . I just ... I was , um ... It was a figure of speech . The reason I ask is , why is it so urgent ... to do an autopsy at 3 : 00 in the morning ? I mean , that kind of rush . It 's just unheard of . We are trying to look for the killer . We got murder victims stacked three deep in the freezer . Plus , you got this camera crew recording everything . Why ? Because the F.B.I. has nothing to hide . Look , there is no ulterior motive here . It 's ... Are you gonna help me out here or what ? Yeah , of course . Thank you . Why did you mention the hantavirus ? - Look , I ... Oh , my God . - Call 911 . Call 911 ! 911 ! Get out of here ! Come on ! It 's not the hantavirus . It looks for all the world like the hantavirus , but I can promise you that it 's not . Well , I mean , she exhibited all the symptoms ... the hemorrhagic fever , the severe chills , acute shock ... I mean , the thing is that they all developed in a matter of seconds . And the hantavirus doesn 't kill that fast . I mean , no virus in the world kills that fast . You were talking about the hantavirus right before she died ? - Why ? - Because she kept bringing it up . I mean , it was like the power of suggestion , Mulder . She was standing there . She was saying that she was afraid of contagion . And then all of a sudden , she just ... She was afraid . She was afraid , and her fear killed her in the worst possible way that she could imagine . - And what do you mean by that ? - It 's the same . It 's the same M.O. , what we 've been looking for all night . This entity or force somehow vectored off Chantara Gomez to attack this other woman . No , Mulder . I was standing right here . I didn 't see anything . They didn 't see anything . Yeah , but you weren 't afraid . The hell I wasn 't afraid . I don 't know what 's going on here . No , you weren 't afraid for your life . Neither were Steve and Edy , and it left them alone . Mortal fear . I think that 's what it comes down to . This thing , whatever it is , is attracted to that . Everybody who was attacked felt that intensely . - For sakes . - No , no , no . It makes perfect sense . You asked me earlier , " What would this thing be doing in Willow Park ? " Well , where else would it go but a high-crime neighborhood ? Somewhere where people live behind barred windows and are afraid to go out at night . - Where 's Deputy Wetzel ? - Back on patrol . Mulder , you were ... you were walking around with him for three hours . - You didn 't see anything ? - No , no . But I was with him . I was backing him up . Like I said , there 's something about a full moon . Things definitely get strange . Well , we checked everyplace else tonight . Let 's check this place again . Aw ! Come on . God ... - I 'm callin ' for backup . Get out ! Get out now ! Get out ! - It won 't open ! - Let 's go ! I got it ! I got it ! - Come on ! I can 't open it ! - Oh , God ! Oh ... That 's Wetzel 's car . - Wetzel ! - Get the battering ram . Let 's go around back . That gun 's not gonna do ya any good . That 's the battering ram . Well , how come they 're not in yet ? - Wind ? - If you say so . - I wonder who 's in there . Damn ! - I hate you guys . - Where 's Wetzel ? We don 't know . There 's something out there . - Stay where you are . - yeah ! Look at this . Scully . - Deputy Wetzel ? - Scully ! Have you found him ? Wetzel ? - Wetzel ? - Wetzel ! - Wetzel ! - Help me ! Please help me ! Wetzel , don 't be afraid ! - It can 't hurt you ! Don 't be afraid ! - That 's what it wants ! Look ... Wetzel ! - Help me ! It can 't hurt you ! You 're a sheriff s deputy , Wetzel ! Don 't be afraid now ! You 're on national television , so cowboy up ! Jeez ! Wetzel . He 's alive . - Deputy Wetzel ! We 're up here ! What happened ? The sun just came up . Hang in there , kid . Do you think the deputy stopped it , whatever it was ? Maybe it just went away until the next full moon . I don 't know . You gotta figure there 's enough fear in the world ... that if it doesn 't show up in Willow Park , it 's gonna show up someplace else . You didn 't get the proof that you wanted , Mulder . Well , hey , it all depends on how they edit it together . This is gonna be a hard one to write up . 132 at Bush . I 've got him at gunpoint . Okay , gunpoint . 132 and Bush . Cover 's code three .

Visa ... passport . What is your ... name ? L-I ... I don 't know . Hey , guard ! Come here ! Andale . ! Hey , guard ! Somebody come here ! [ Chuckling ] Something funny ? Nice touch ... putting it back on . Your one shoe . Yeah , well , maybe I like to hop . You speak English . Why didn 't you say something before ? You weren 't funny before . Uh-huh . Where are we ? What 's the name of this place ? What , the jail ? The town . Tell me the name of the town . Tell me where I am . Sangradura . Mexico ? Man , if you can 't remember ... you must have had one fine good time getting here . What 's your name ? Damn , you don 't know that either , huh ? [ Chuckling ] Call you " One Shoe . " Senor Un Zapato , huh ? [ Men Laughing ] Hey , One Shoe , what do you know ? I know I 'm getting the hell out of here . You got money to bribe the police ? That 's what it takes . I just need to get to a phone ... and call the U.S. Embassy . Yeah , they can get you home , I guess . Where is home ? You know what I think , One Shoe ? Maybe getting home is not in your best interest . How 's that ? This isn 't Tijuana or Cabo . We don 't see Americans in this town ... unless they 're on the run from something , somebody . This town ... people like you come here to disappear . People like me ? You don 't know me . Hey ... you don 't know you . Daddy ? Daddy ? [ Keys Jangling ] Domingo Salmeron . Hey , One Shoe ... nobody coming for you . You want to hop out of here with me ? I 've got a job for you . What kind of job ? What the hell do you care ? You work hard , maybe I 'll even buy you another shoe . Right one , left one ... your choice . Hey ! Right here ! Thanks . Some other time . Hey ! Hey ! You watch your hands . You 're bought and paid for . You understand ? I own you like I own that car . I 'll pay you back your money . You don 't tell me what you 'll do . I tell you what you 'll do . This makes one thing we know about you . You 're not a man of your word . [ Clattering ] It fit good ? What else of mine you got ? My wallet , my documents ? What else did you take from me ? Show me what else you got . Show me ! Show me . ! I 'm desaparecido ? What does that mean ? ? [ Mexican Music Playing ] What 's the job ? We 're movers . What do you move ? Mexicanos , Guatemaltecos ... sometimes even Chinese . Drive them up north , across the border into McAllen . You 're coyotes . Don 't turn your nose up at me . For all you know , you 've spent your life fondling little boys . No digas que quieres trabajar con este hijo de perra . You start tomorrow . I 'd invite you to have a drink with us ... but Nestor hates you . They 'll rent you a room upstairs . I don 't have any money . First month 's salary . Don 't try and leave town . This mean anything to you ? Not a thing ... other than the fact that ... you have silver in your pocket ... and you still ask me for money . I 'm a marine . Semper Fi . A.D. Skinner , Agent Scully ... what 's this I 'm hearing about Mexico ? Well , this came in last night ... from U.S. Customs . It 's a blowup from a security camera ... at the border crossing in Laredo , Texas . It was taken at 12 : 50 a.m. On the morning of the fourth . We 're sure this is Doggett ? It 's been scanned to Agent Reyes . She also believes it is him . I 'd say this reshapes the investigation . It 's our first solid lead . Now , with your permission , I 'd like to contact ... our legate 's office and extend our task force ... south of the border . I 'm not extending the task force . I 'm disbanding it . Excuse me ? I see no other choice . For the past 12 days I 've had 40 agents working overtime ... scouring the entire state ofTexas ... in what appears to be a waste of effort . I can 't move them lock , stock and barrel into Mexico ... not on the strength of this . Turn it over to the Mexican federal police . Doggett 's in their jurisdiction , not ours . Sir , he could be injured . Whether you believe it or not ... I want to find him as badly as you do . But the FBI 's resources are already taxed ... by national security concerns . There are political realities I have to account for . Sir ... Agent Reyes is still in San Antonio . She was raised in Mexico . She could offer the federal police some on-site help . She can help them all she wants . But from this side of the border . Mr. Molina , you 're a hard man to get an audience with . I 've been trying for the better part of two weeks . What 's keeping you so busy ? Selling tractors . I own the biggest farm equipment dealership in south Texas ... AGCO , John Deere , New Holland , CAT . Impressive . I 'm sorry , I don 't speak Spanish . She says I sell drugs . Please don 't speak Spanish anymore . You know Hollis Rice , don 't you ? Vice president of Pan American Mercantile ? Sure . I do business with his bank . I know he 's missing . My partner , John Doggett , was investigating his disappearance . I 'm betting my partner ... came to you with questions . When would this have happened ? Two weeks ago . No , sorry . I don 't remember any person named Doggett . Agent , I don 't quite know what you 're implying . Mr. Molina 's an upstanding businessman ... and a pillar of the commun ... " Pillar of the community ? " Does anyone actually ... use that phrase except Mob lawyers ? I 'll tell you what 's clear to me . You 're some kind of middleman in a smuggling operation . Hollis Rice laundered money for your cartel ... until something went wrong . Maybe he got greedy , maybe he talked too much . Your cartel made him disappear . Agent ... My partner has disappeared , too . He 's in Mexico , I know that much ... and I will find him , whatever it takes . Your only personal hope for the future ... is that I find him alive . Now where is he ? Unless my client is under arrest ... this meeting is over . No ? Come on , Mariano . [ Whispering ] Daddy . Hmm ? Get up , I want to show you something . Come on . Let 's go ! Daddy , come on ! Please ! Can it wait another hour ? No . Why , what is it ? A surprise . Shh , don 't wake your mom . [ Phone Ringing ] Senor ? Senor ? Cabina tres . [ Ringing ] Marine Corps Public Affairs Office . Staff Sergeant McCormick speaking . Yeah , uh ... this is Detective , uh Ladatel calling from Mexico . I 'm hoping you can give me some help . Yes , sir , if I can . We 've got a marine down here who 's been hit by a taxicab . He 's been messed up pretty good . He doesn 't remember his own name . He doesn 't have any I D. We need to contact his family . I assume there 's somebody somewhere ... who 's worrying about him . Any chance you can give me ... a social security number or a date of birth ? No , unfortunately , uh , the only thing I have to go by ... is there 's a tattoo on his left shoulder that says ... " 24th MAU . We Shall Not Forget . " You have any idea what that means ? Yes , sir , I do . The 24th Marine Amphibious Unit . It refers to the Lebanon barracks bombing in 1983 . That narrows things down . Yeah , good , good . This guy 's , I don 't know , he 's six feet , 190 pounds . Brown hair , blue eyes , about 40 years old . If you could just put a name to him . If you could just tell me anything at all about him . Anything . We 'll definitely look into it . [ Door Opens ] Detective , do you have a number where I can reach you ? Detective ? [ Man Speaking Spanish Over Radio ] Hey . Sounding good . Sounding better than it was . It won 't sound good until it gets new seals . [ Speaking Spanish ] Thank God I got somebody ... worth a damn . If you 'd only drive for me . You got a few odd jobs , fine . I 'm not breaking the law for you . A man of principle ... as far as you know . Found something out about you today . You 're not going to like it . Says your name is Henry Bruck . The Federales are looking for you ... in connection with a double murder . Doesn 't give details ... but that description 's you as far as I can see . Don 't take it so hard . A man does what he does . I 'm not judging you . Just keep away from the Federales , okay ? We 'll keep you safe . Monica . Dana . Surprise , surprise . How did you escape Kersh 's cost-cutting regimen ? Did you see ? He shut us down . Well , actually he doesn 't know that I 'm here . Nor does he know that Skinner is headed to Mexico ... to consult with the federal police . Perfect timing , I hope . Look what just got handed to me . This says that someone in Mexico ... is trying to track down a former marine ... matching Doggett 's description . It says that he was in an accident ... and possibly suffering from amnesia . Wait ... Detective Ladatel ? Yeah , that 's who placed the call . Does that sound familiar to you ? Ladatel is a Mexican telephone calling card . We 'll trace the call . [ Footsteps ] Domingo , is that you ? Siempre trabajo . I speak English , by the way . Yeah ? Yeah . See you in hell , FBI . [ Screaming ] [ Gunshot ] Nestor ? Oh , God , no . Nestor ? You ? Did you send him after me ? What ? What 's that mean ? Did you send him to kill me ? Tell me who I am . I don 't know who you are . Tell me who I am ! I don 't know , you son of a bitch ! But you killed my friend . You 're a killer . That 's who you are . [ Gun Cocking ] Desaparecido . You 're one of the disappeared ones . What 's that mean , disappeared ? Disappeared by who ? The Cartel . They own the town ... everything and everybody . People who make trouble for them wind up dead . Other people who make more trouble ... dead than alive get this . They took away my memory ? How ? ! How do I get it back ? You don 't . That 's the point . Daddy , Daddy ... Daddy , Daddy ... Get up . I wanna show you something . Come on . It 's a surprise . Come on . [ Groaning ] [ Whimpering ] [ Groans ] [ Car Approaching ] John ... I 've been looking for you everywhere . Who the hell are you ? I 'm your partner Monica . Your name is John Doggett . You 're an FBI agent . Do you remember ? John , trust me . We got to leave . I 'll explain it in the car ... but we 're not safe here . [ Cars Approaching ] [ Speaking Spanish ] They 're telling us to come out . Sure , they want us to make it easy for them . Cartel owns the cops in this town . They 're going to kill us . They 're going to try . Take cover . It won 't be long before they get tired of waiting . So , we 're partners , huh ? How long we been working together ? Not long . But we 've known each other for years . [ Police Speaking Spanish ] They 're giving us one minute . What 's the name of my son ? It 's weird . It 's the only thing I can remember is I have a son . I can see his face , but I can 't remember his name . Luke . Luke . How old is Luke ? I can 't even remember that . Oh , God . Oh , God , no . He 's dead . He was murdered . Is that right ? Is that right ? ! He was kidnapped . He was just a little boy ... Oh ! The FBI got involved . I was assigned to the case . That 's when you and I met . Oh , God ! [ Glass Breaks ] God ! Oh , God , John , they 're smoking us out . John , I need you here . I need you to focus here , John . [ Coughing ] [ Gunshots ] John . John ! If we 're going to die here ... you 're going to die on your feet ! You hear me ? Do you hear me ? ! [ Gunshots Continue ] Get in the bus . Hang on ! [ Yelling In Spanish ] You work for the Cartel . You make their enemies disappear . Desaparecido . You understand me ? I speak English , but I don 't understand you . Like hell you don 't . You gave me these ... when you took my memory . I have no idea how you do it ... but everything I am , everything I have ... my identity , you robbed that from me . I don 't know who has been saying those things to you . How can you prove them ? I was searching for a man , a banker from Texas . Hollis Rice was the banker . He was out of his mind . He didn 't even know his name . You robbed him of that . And then you tried to do the same thing to me . You failed , you son of a bitch . I remember everything . [ Skinner ] Agent Doggett ... leave him to us . Why would you want to remember ? You can 't tell me you 're happier now ... because you recall your life . I saw it all . So much pain . Why would you want to struggle so long and hard ... to get that pain back ? Because it 's mine . Look , Daddy ! I can do it ! John ... I 'm so sorry ... about Luke ... and about you having to relive that . I 'll take the bad as long as I remember the good . [ Child ] I made this . !

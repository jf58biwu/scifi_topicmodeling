Why are you asking me ? You went to the Palace Hotel 's casino recently , right ? It 's not like I went to play around . It was a job , right ? I know . I looked into a lot of things , and you came up , but ... You know the woman who was wearing this , right ? Woman ? My client fell in love with the woman you had with you at first sight . What did you do that for ? What is it ? What 's so funny ? That was Kai . Kai ! It was Kai in drag ! Why ? For the job . And what does your client want to do with Kai ? It looks like he wants to meet him again . He gave me this much of an advance . Five ? ! It 's not going to take any time to investigate . This is delicious work , isn 't it ? Yeah , it 's great . And I 'll be generous with your cut too . What do you think ? Do you want in ? And so , do it ! No ! Listen ... No way ! I said that I wasn 't going to dress up like that again , didn 't I ? Furthermore , there 's no way I can go on a date . I 'd get found out immediately ! This is an act of kindness . Listen , it looks like this guy has been thinking about you every day , and hasn 't had a thing to eat or anything . I 'm telling you to make this pure guy 's dreams come true , even if only for a day . As long as you 're eating here , you have to earn your own keep , right , freeloader ? Kai ... Asuka ? Make that person 's dreams come true ! That being the case , do it ! Why me ? Maria ! Zack 's route was destroyed last night . It looks like several of the other weapons dealers have been caught as well . So Ashurum 's scheme is to cut off all of our routes and constrain us ? What do we do ? It doesn 't matter . If some weapons dealers getting arrested makes us waver , then we would have lost a long time ago . By the way ... What happened to Maxim ? Who knows ? Now that you mention it , I haven 't seen him since his audience with Mr. Erimiya . You really ARE a fine woman , Kai . Kai , would you stop looking so sour ? This is a job . Smile , will you ? Grin . All right . From here on , your name is Josephione . Jo ... what ? You 've got questionable taste ... It 's all right . It 's only for today , after all . So , where 's the client ? There . Hello ! Thank you very much ! Aren 't you hugging the wrong person ? No ! No , no , no ! Because you did a splendid job of making my wish come true , all from that high heel of destiny ! You are the greatest detective ! I will sing your praises ! Wait a second ... Look , she seems to be surprised too . Nice to meet you ! I 'm Edgar Hanson . Hello ... Change the pitch of your voice a little ! Your voice is as beautiful as I imagined ! Oh , I 'm so moved ! Well , this is Miss Josephione . Josephione ... what a darling name ! I look forward to spending the whole day with you ! And now , I will take my leave . Now you two , take your time and enjoy yourselves . Thank you very much , Mr. Leonid ! You 're wonderful ! Ow , ow , ow ... Man , he 's getting excited , isn 't he ? Despite appearances , he 's quite the enterprising man . He won 't backstab his clients . After all , trust is the most important thing in this world . Though if his clients saw him like this , I think that their trust for him would drop to zero . Hey ! Yuuki ? ! What are you doing ? I was worried about Kai . If they find out he 's a man ... I 'm not saying that your makeup job is bad . I think it 's perfect , like a professional makeup artist , but ... But ... Come home before it gets too late . See you ! Yuuki ... Well ... Yes ? There 's one thing I want to give to you . Please accept it . It was a single shoe that bound us together . So I thought this could take the place of the shoe with the broken heel . It would be nice if it suits you . Thank you . Would you put them on , please ? Here ? Yes ! Then excuse me , please . How wonderful . They look very good on you . Thank goodness ! Right ... If it would be all right , I 'd like for you to wear those all day . Okay ... Oh , I 'm so glad that you 're a good person , Miss Josephione . Actually , this is the first time I 've gone on a date in my life . Perhaps this could be called destiny ? When I first glimpsed you in the casino , all I could think about was you ! Can you tell ? I 'm extremely happy right now ! Yes ? I 'll gather up my courage and say this ! The reason I met you today is because there 's something I just have to say to you ... That is ... M ... M ... M ? M ? Marry me , please ! Yes ? Yes ! Thank you very much ! Yes ? Yes ? I mean , when you said " yes , " it meant your answer just now meant " yes , " right ? Yes ? Marriage ? ! Kai is going to ? ! Well , that is ... " Yes " may be " yes , " but it 's not the " yes " that means " yes , " and ... But just now , didn 't you say yes ? I 'm telling you , you see , I was so surprised that I said , " Yes ? " That 's all . It 's not that I said yes to marrying you . I had dreamed for too much . When I met you , I 'd say this , I 'd say that ... Eat at that restaurant , shop in this store ... I had it all planned out , but ... The instant I saw you , it all flew out of my head , and I ended up saying the line I was going to say to you last . I 'm an idiot , aren 't I ? I 'm sorry to have troubled you . I 'm going home . Please wait ! Let 's say this didn 't happen , and start the date over from the beginning . Everyone has times when they fail , when they 're nervous . Right ? I was wondering what would happen . Kai is so kind ! Thank you very much ! Miss Josephione , you really are a kind person ! We have reservations at an excellent restaurant . That 's right , the date is starting right now . It 'll be fabulous . Fabulous ? ! " Fabulous " ... Kai 's so cute ! Come on , let 's go . Excuse me for a moment . Yes , hello ? What did you say ? I understand . Thank you for telling me . Now please , run away , quickly . Is something the matter ? Miss Josephione , I 'm sorry , but ... You 're Edgar Hanson , right ? Come quietly ! You are suspected of breaking the Maintenance of Public Order Act , article 36 , paragraph 4 ! You 'll be talking to us ! Who are you ? His partner ? Partner ? You 're coming with us ! Stop it ! She has nothing to do with this ! Come on , hurry ! Wait ... I 'd better tell Yuuki . I 've fallen in love with you all over again , Miss Josephione ! More importantly ... That way ! I 'm sorry , because of me ... No ... More importantly , the Maintenance of Public Order Act is pretty serious , isn 't it ? You 're pretty used to those . Oh , you mean this ? They 're my stock in trade . Stock in trade ? I 'm an arms dealer . Although there are people who call me a broker too . A broker ? ! Yes . Come on , come on , yes ! All right ! Oh , Yuuki ! A broker ? Kai 's with a scary person like that ? ! You watched them this whole time , right ? Was he at all scary ? But I thought he was a normal company employee . The company part isn 't wrong . He buys goods and sells them wholesale . His work is nothing more than that . But ... Well , he does sell weapons for a living . It 's not something that he can exactly brag about . Yuuki , please ! Save Kai ! Don 't worry , Asuka . But ... Kai isn 't as weak as you think he is . I see . He 's been captured too ? In that case , where are you , right now ? Yes , you 're right . Let 's stop . After all , there 's no telling if someone , somewhere , is listening in . Yes ... Then let 's both be careful . Please don 't look at me like that . Gald needs these weapons . Why ? So that we can keep the alliance of the twelve corporations from doing whatever they want . The corporations that don 't agree with Ashurum , who are working to redevelop and are interfering with Gald , divert weapons here to be used as a counter to Ashurum . That isn 't because they 're thinking of Gald ! Yes , I understand that . But without these weapons , they could just do as they please with this city . Weapons are weapons . Even you 're affected by the danger ! You 're very kind , Miss Josephione . Edgar Hanson ! We 've sealed off the area ! There 's no place for you to run ! I 'm going to take out the lights . When I do , let 's run . Oh , how embarrassing . There 's a big difference between selling them and shooting them . I 'm just not very good at shooting them . Miss Josephione , I cannot get you wrapped up in all this any further . I will surrender . While I do , please escape . Edgar , you 're a kind person too , aren 't you ? What the ... Edgar , this is our chance ! Hurry ! Right ... Put out the fires ! Hurry ! Wait , arresting the suspect comes first ! Storm the place ! Assault squad ! What 's your situation ? What 's wrong ? He 's been shot . I 'll transport him to the hospital . What ? ! Shot ? ! How ? Let me see ! What ? ! What in the world is going on ? ! What are you planning on doing from now on ? I 'm going to continue being a broker , of course . Why ? Are you just going to keep running ? It 's all right . I have allies . Allies ? This city still needs people like me . I was convinced of that tonight . I believe that the reason that the police cars blew up all of the sudden is because the people I 'm on good terms with secretly assisted us . That was ... When we , the citizens , have taken back Gald from Ashurum with our own hands ... At that time , I 'll have a proper proposal for you ! Yes ? Oh , thank goodness , you said yes ! Please wait for me . I AM your destined person , after all ! What ? ! I 'm telling you , " yes " may be " yes , " but it wasn 't a " yes " that means " yes . " I 'm home . Asuka ... When I saw your face , somehow all of the tension just drained out of me . Thank goodness you 're all right ! You were worried about me ? Thanks , Asuka . What happened to the dork that proposed to you ? He managed to get away . Why are you making that kind of face ? It 's nothing . I was just thinking that he was a nice person . And wondering why someone that nice is continuing to be a broker ... And did you reveal yourself to that nice person in the end ? I stayed as Josephione the whole time ! Furiisogu ame ni mou nurehajimeta futari Isoide nukedashita nanimokamo wo sutete Minna kara mienai you ni yubi wo tsunaide Sore ga futari no himitsu no sain Dakara koko kara saratte imasugu saratte Tonight midnight Dakara mou tomenaide imasugu sawatte Tonight , it 's true love Modorenai yoru ga hajimaru Yo ! How is everyone doing ? It looks like the folks at Ashurum are finally beginning to move . Shin-Lu and Shen-Lon return , and it looks like that bastard Maxim is up to no good as well . Jeez . Things are tough for those kids , Kai and Yuuki . But don 't worry ! Because I , the great and mighty Leonid , am in Gald !

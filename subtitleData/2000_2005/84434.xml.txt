That 's 22 years afteryou- - - Died . We all died . But that 's impossible . Am I having one of my dreams ? I 'm going towake up , aren 't I ? This can 't be real . Is it ? My name is Jeff Hale . I 'm Alice . Alice Lidell Hargreaves . [ Woman Sobbing ] Well , Alice Lidell Hargreaves , something or someone put us here . That 's obvious . The metal cannisters , the atmosphere . The air--it 's breathable , Give it to me ! That 's mine ! It might be a different planet . It might be a different physical dimension , maybe even a spiritual dimension . - You mean heaven ? - Or hell . At this point , anything 's possible . [ Man ] Let it go ! [ Man Shouts , Indistinct ] [ Man # 2 ] Where are we ? Where ? I know the coast . This isn 't right . This isn 't Polska . [ Chattering ] What country have they taken us to ?

I was a professor ofancient history at the University of Krakow . This is strange , so strange . Forgive me . My name is Lev Ruach . I have one question . Who won the war ? What war ? The second war . - We did . - Good . - Good ! - [ Explosion ] [ Wailing , Shouting , Indistinct ] - [ Man ] That is Lucifer ! That is Lucifer ! - No ! Lucifer is here for us ! Lucifer !

[ Snarling ] [ Grunts , Groaning ] This one is a problem . Enough ! Enough ! Better him than any ofus . The one must always be sacrificed forthe good ofthe many . Wait a minute . Who areyou ? - A citizen of Rome . And you ? - I 'm an American . We live by different rules than you do . And how is that relevant here ? Well , wejust don 't start killing each other . You are the enforcer ofyour laws ? No , but ifwe 're going to survive here , then we have to learn how to get along with each other . Rules , social order- - the fundamental aim ofall responsible citizens who desire a quality oflife that raises them above the animal . Yeah , well , that 's great , but beforewe get that far , we maywant to find some shelter . You know , I suggest thatwe establish our positions first ... to avoid confusion amongst the citizens later . What ? What 's wrong with you ? Stop it ! [ Choking , Gasping ] Someone do something . [ Choking ] [ Man ] Stop ! - You fightwell . - You fight dirty . I fight towing . [ Hoofbeats ] [ Horses Whinnying ] [ Man ] Look !

Everyone that we 've ever known , all our descendents , all our ancestors . - All our loved ones . - And enemies . Move ! Let 's hope there 's plenty of room , or it might start to get a little crowded . No one rules billions with a sword from the backofa horse . We 're caught in some personal fiefdom here , one ofmany , would be my guess . Keep going ! Come on , come on ! [ Guard ] Overhere ! [ Guard # 2 ] Carryit ! Come on ! [ People Chattering ] Go on !

[ Breathing Heavily ] I am Mali , Prophetess ofYoruba , mother spirit ofmy people . - Whitepeople take us , - The Yoruba ? TheYo- - TheYoruba . TheYoruba were an African tribe , I think . White people tookyou away in a ship . Huh ? Yes . Sixteenth or 1 7th century . Portuguese traders , possibly British . Mali . I was also enslaved bywhite people . Byyour own people ? Call them anothertribe . Andasyoucansee , there are manytribes ofmanydifferent colors , [ Guard ] Get in ! - Oh , you poor dear . - Her name is Gwenafra . She is mute . [ Alice , Gasping ] What- - [ Mali Gasps ] My name is Monat . [ Alice ] What is it ? What areyou ? I am not human , as you can see , but neither am I dangerous . Iassureyou , It 's all right . Incredible . I am from the star system your astronomers named Tau Ceti . Yes . Tau Ceti . Are there other extraterrestrials here ? Alas , I am the only one . You died on Earth . You were on Earth . - You are 20th century . - Yes , early 21 st . I was an astronaut , just likeyou . My ship charted a large asteroid approaching your planet . We hastened towarn your authorities , but our intentions were misread and wewere shot down . I alone survived the crash . I tried my best under interrogation , butyour scientists were skeptical ofour advanced projections . Chaos theory . Foryour people , itwas just that- - a theory . For mine , itwas a practice . As we predicted , the asteroid 's course was deflected when it passed through theJovian Belt . Bythen , itwas too late to stop it . The impactwould have equaled the detonation of 1 00 million ofyour hydrogen bombs . No life form could have survived . - Well , this is more preposterous than H.G. Wells . - Believe me . Ask around . Findsomeone who claims to have livedon Earth , afterJune 18 , 2039A , D , - What is it saying ? - Use of masculine gender would be appropriate ... when addressing me . [ People Chattering ] He 's saying ... the Earth , as we know it , is gone . Yourplanet is dead , butyourspecies has been preserved , - And no way back ? - One is to assume . Have you found any other forms of intelligence here ? None higher than myself , ifyou will forgive my lack ofhumility . How long haveyou been here ? Twoyears offreedom . Two days of captivity . Wewere resurrected together . She appears to be the only human on this planet who has been resurrected as a child . I have no idea why . Neither does she . And Valdemar ? Hewas one ofthe first . Ten years on Riverworld- - more than enough time to construct a modest empire . His armies are known to all as the Vandals . My peoplewill hear ofthis , and theywill come for me . Doyou see anything ? They 're lockedup , surroundedbyguards , We can go in as merchants , No . No , we can 't risk it . Sam , Gwen is a child , and Monat 's knowledge is critical for our success . And ifwe get caught ? No . There are too many other lives depending ' on us . You know the rules- - go for broke first , go for anything else second . He 'll take them to the fortress , When we 're free and clear , then we 'll come back for ' em . [ Wind Blowing ] Who areyou ? Why haveyou come here ? All I have to do is raise myvoice . Free me . You goyourway , I 'll go mine . This worldis large , We 'll never have to meet each other again . [ Hale Sighs ] [ Roman ] Theprisoner 's free ! [ Guard ] Get the gate ! The prisoner 's free !

Mywarriors deserve theiramusements , Flavius , And here are the men that will give it to them .

[ Dying Groan ] [ Crowd Cheering ] [ Laughing ] - What is your name , prisoner ? - I am Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus , citizen ofRome , And now , a commissioned warrior in myVandal armies . What sayyou to that , Flavius ? Flavius Carminus Doremus- - captain ofthe Praetorian Guard , You were a lotyounger when I first promoted you , and I was somewhat more seasoned . Your Majesty , you have returned to us . [ Crowd Chattering ] Well , you might know me better by my public name- - Germanicus Drusus Claudius ... Nero . Emperor of Rome . Hail Nero ! [ Flavius , Men ] Hail Nero ! Hail Nero ! Hail Nero ! Hail Nero ! Hail Nero ! Hail Nero ! Hail Nero ! [ Hushed ] Did you miss me ? I knewyou 'd come . When the fighting starts , meet me at the tunnel entrance . There 's a way out underground . You ready ? [ Laughing ] [ Scoffs ] Never heard ofyou . Andthis is not Rome , This is the Riverworld , Andhere , mylaw is the onlylaw , [ People Laughing ] Yeah ! Get rid ofhim ! [ Man ] Don 't move ! [ Man # 2 ] Stayback ! Ah , but , you see , things are gonna get complicated between us . Your death will be sweet . [ Man ] Killhim , Valdemar ! [ Crowd ] Killhim ! - Do I not get the benefit ofa weapon ? - No . Oh , good . So much more interesting for me . - [ Valdemar Grunting ] - [ Crowd Cheering , Yelling ] [ Cheering , Yelling Continue , Muffled ] Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! [ Shouting , Indistinct ] [ Shouting , Indistinct ] [ Crowd Cheering , Yelling ] - [ CrowdCheering ] - [ Groans ] Maybeyou will find it as entertaining foryou ! [ CrowdCheering , Yelling ] [ Chattering ] Who else challenges Nero ? Good . All right . Act like slaves . Come on , you lazy bunch ofslugs ! Move ! Come on ! Move ! - Prisoners are forbidden to enter here . - Except ifValdemar orders it . - To do what ? - Soldier , ifyou want to be the one ... that questions the master 's orders , go ahead , I 'll wait here . - The prisoners have escaped . - Go ahead ! Go . Go then . Move ! Come on , you ! - Move ! Move ! - Close all the exits ! You too ! Overthere ! [ Man ] Go forit ! You 'd never believe what 's goin ' on out there . Oh ! That 's not gonna do anything . Please tell me every day on this planet isn 't going to be so eventful . What areyou doing ? He had a helmet on him . I 'm sorry . Come on . Everybody , let 's go ! [ Wind Blowing ] [ Monat ] My community is two days ' walk upriver . There is food and safetythere . Wewill takeyou ifyou wish . It is the leastwe can do . - Ifl go , we all go . - Youarestrangers , It willnot be up to me whether youare allowedtostay , but I will speak on your behalf . I am not one ofyou . Erzuliewill guide me to my people . Lev ! Lev ! Mali ! Mali , where are you going ? Can 't force herto come ifshe doesn 'twant to . Let 's keep movin ' . - [ Hale ] What 's beyondthose mountains ? - [ Monat ] No one knows . They are unclimbable . Following the river is the onlyway to travel in this world . [ Objects Streaking ] The atmosphere must be thinner here than on Earth . Enough to make Riverworlders keep one eye on the ground and one on the sky . The great debate in mytime ... was the possibilitythat life existed on other planets . Hmm . Nowyou know . How many ? An infinite number . But to end up on this planet with your particular life forms ... in this strange dimension beyond life itself- - that I had not planned on . Well , I guess we 're in the same boat , aren 'twe ? You humans have each other here . You have family , friends , lovers- - all waiting to be discovered . You have that hope . I have no one to discover . I have no hope . We are not in the same boat . Weshouldfindshelterandrest , It willbe darksoon , The woman is following us . Where ? I don 't see her . You 're blessed with five senses , Hale . Sight is onlyone ofthem , @ @ [ Chanting In Native Language ] @ @ [ Chanting ] The other night , when you escaped , the doorwas locked . Therewas , uh , somebody- - How do I saythis ? He had a hood on . So I couldn 'tsee his face , but I 've seen him before , under the water . He has some kind of power . He 's made me see things . You mean like a vision ? Ofwhat ? I don 't know . The future maybe ? [ Grunting ] [ Rocks Fall ] [ Chuckles ] You escaped . Gwen . This is Hale , the man who freedus , andhis companions , [ Monat ] This is Tane , He is one ofus , Monat , you know the rules . A strangerwho saves my life is no longer a stranger to me . He is my friend . Get Sam . Watch yourself . [ Man , Western Drawl ] Monat , It 's goodto haveyou back , myfriend , You must be Hale . It wouldseem I oweyou a measure ofgratitude , Escaping from Valdemar 's clutches- - that 's quite impressive , - He 'll be mad enough to come afteryou . - No , he won 't . He 's dead . He who lives by the sword- - - When ? - Yesterday , by a man who claims to be the Roman emperor Nero . Well , that 's quite a claim . Though I guess the true Nero has to be somewhere on this planet . Everyone comes here eventually , so it 'spossible , He saved our lives , Sam . Well , y 'all know too much now anyway . You can enter our camp , but onlyon the understanding thatyou 're forbidden to leave until Isayso , No exceptions , Verywell . Follow me . [ Sawing ] What on earth ? [ Chattering ] Oh , you 're not on Earth anymore . Come on . Welcome to the Go ForBroke , For my sins , I am the captain . It must have taken years to build a vessel ofthis- - Six anda half , to be exact , Ifyouplease , I modeled her on the steamers I used to pilot up and down the Mississippi . Add a couple ofsails forthe scaredy ancients among us to make them feel comfortable . Those ofus from the civilized democracies , we are in the minority here in this world . The average Riverworlder wouldkillyouas soon as look atyou , But on this vessel , you 're gonna find some rules and freedoms that don 't exist on the land , And with those liberties , we are gonna travel everywhere and anywhere this riverwill take us . Areyou going downriver ? You got a reason we should go upriver ? Yeah . Nobody ever learned anything sailing awayfrom the source . Howaboutseeingthe engine room ? Everything you need to see you can see from up here . We usedthe best materials andmen , And we got fellas here who worked on St , Paul 's Cathedral , the pyramids , the Titanic , which they tell me was quite an engineering feat , despite its later mishap . I 'm sure any question you have will be answered soon enough . - [ Clang ] - In the meantime , there 's plenty ofjobs around here foryou to earn your keep . These areyourshadows , Doesn 't look like we have much ofa choice . It 's nothing personal . Just can 't afford a security risk this close to launching her . Sam , A word , Excuse me . Well , what is it ? I found enough palladium to start thewheels and keep them turning . Where ? A decoration on Valdemar 's throne . It 's pretty rare , Monat . Any Cetian can smell saturated metal hydride a mile away . Ourtechnology is based on it . Timing 's good , With Valdemargone , it 'llbeprettyconfusedaround there , I 'm sure I can get it , Valdemarwe knew . Nero we don 't . What if one of us gets caught ? No . Can 't risk it . Sam , the whole rock gives us enough critical mass to finally launch this boat . I saywaiting is the risk . This is not a democracy , Tane . I decidewho goes , who stays , when we launch and when we don 't . And what I 'm tellingyou both is- - I 'll think about it . Howyou everconvincedme to develop this cockamamie technology ofyours , I 'll neverknow , What 's the matterwith a wood-burning furnace anyway ? Myboat powered byrocks , - [ Laughter , Chattering ] - Pull it close . Gwen , look . I could makeyou a pretty dress . Me ? Look , I 've almost forgotten what it 's like to wear civilized clothes . How about I teach you to sew as well ? [ Wind Blowing ] I 'm just gonna take a bath . What , you wanna comewatch me ? Whoo ! [ Gasps ] What- - Doyou mind ? No , I don 't . [ Chuckles ] In mytime , when a bunch ofus wouldget togetherin a hot tub , we 'dcallit aparty , - But I guess you didn 't do that kind ofstuffin your time . - Not if one had manners . I wonderwhat my children would thinkofme now ? Did you have a family ? I had a son . He died ofleukemia . And his ... mother , well , she tried- - She tried , butshe couldn 't standthepain , She took herown life , I 'm so sorry . So who 's gonna get out first ? Not me . [ Chuckles ] - Howmuch ofit is mine ? - As far as the eye can see . [ Flavius ] To expandfurther , we need the ship the rebels are building , Ourspies tell us it 's nearlyreadyto launch , Then we should act soon . [ Grunting ] [ Flavius ] We mine enough ore from the rocks that fall from the sky to keep our men fullyarmed , The rebels steal from the harvest fields occasionally , but it never amounts to much , - Valdemar couldn 't catch them ? - They are highly skilled . Sometimes it is better to allow them some freedom . Their ingenuity can be useful . Tom got more cuffs and kisses that day , according to Aunt Polly 's varying moods , than he 'd earned before in a wholeyear . He hardly knewwhich expressed the most gratefulness to God and affection for himself . More tomorrow . Time foryou to go to sleep . What 's this ? [ Chuckling ] Well , who did this foryou ? Huh ? Itwasn 't one ofus . One ofthe new crowd , huh ? Was it Mr. Hale ? Mr. Lev ? Miss Alice ? Miss Alice . Well , well , well . She 's quite an artist . And dressmakertoo . You two quite like each other , huh ? Don 't get too fond ofher . Correct me ifI 'm wrong . I don 't recall inviting you below decks . Take us with you . I have a hundred berths on board and a hundred workers readyto fill them . Besides , we 're goin ' downriver . That doesn 't seem to interestyou . Sam , listen to me . In all youryears here , haveyou ever seen a native ofthis world ? Not in 1 0 years . There 's stories , but that 's all they are . They 're not stories . Someone came to me while I was still under the water ... and he gave me the power to see the future . I saw Nero . I saw a dark tower wrapped in ice and snow ... and I saw this exact boat headed upriver and I was on it . Well , I reckon ifthat 's ourfuture , then it 'll happen just theway you saw it . You don 't believe me . I don 't believe anyone , and I don 't believe in anyone except myself . Then believe in what your eyes are telling you . Believe in that . Lookat this world around you- - the obelisk , the cannisters , the food , the clothing . You can 't tell me that someone isn 't behind this . You spentyears working on this boat . Mm . Years ! Don 'tyou want to take it out and find some answers foryourself ? Answers ? Hell . I didn 't find any answers in my last life . Whythe hell would I want towaste mytime trying to find them in this one ? And you forget , I 'm olderthan you . I 'm a lot olderthan you . I have a 30-year-old body and a 90-year-old mind . And what I have learned in my considerable time is to enjoythejourney , not the destination . Now the closest obelisk is quite a hike . They 'll be needing some help in the morning with the canisters . Why don 'tyou go makeyourselfuseful ? [ Grunting ] [ Whistles ] Ah , ah , ah , ah . That 's not nice . Up the hill . Up the hill . Monat ! Tane ! Get down here ! Look what Ifound ! Sneaking around . Trying to find- - [ Groaning ] Why did you- - Why did you do that ? Hewas a spy . AVandal scout . It is the wayofRiverworld , - We could have questioned him . - You are a stranger here . You have no right to question him orme , [ Hale ] Someone ! I needsome help with this man ! Well , the good news is theywon 't miss him for a few days . [ Monat ] Sam , ifwe go now , we can be back before then , ready to launch . They 'll never know wewere there . Ifwe gowhere now ? Valdemar 's fortress . There 's some things there that we need . - [ Monat ] He 's been mining the meteors , - Iron forweapons mostly . But meteors contain otheruseful metals , Hale , The rarest is hydratedpalladium , which we intend to use as a fuel for ourboiler , Valdemar found a rock large enough to yield an almost perpetual energy source , Perpetual , huh ? I mpossible . Cold fusion has formed the basis of Cetian energy production for centuries . The hell with the boat then . Let 's build a spaceship ... andwe 'lljustget off this godforsakenplanet , Just the two of us . What doyou say ? Monat , Tane . [ Sighs ] One ofyou goes , one ofyou stays . I can 't risk the loss ofboth ofyou . I will go . Without Monat 's brainpower , the boat doesn 't go anywhere . I broke out ofthere alive . I can break back in . Fine . Both ofyou go . Ifyou 're not back before the next high tide , I 'm gonna assume the worst , I 'm gonna launch herwithout you , on sail power alone . [ Sam ] Even with all these heroics , I can 't guaranteeyou a berth , If there 's not enough room for all of us , at least take the others . Get me the damn rock . There may be room on the deck . [ Sighs ] You trust him ? I don 't trust any human , even you . [ Tane ] Welcome to the ValleyofMeteors , Without them , we wouldn 't have hadenough ore to make ourboiler , We should keep moving . We 're entering Vandal borderlands . We should find cover . You got it ? He said it was behind the headboard . Nah , it 's gone . Looking forthis ? [ Grunting ] You should have freed me when you had the chance . Thosewho help me are rewarded . You 've done well , Yourbargain with Valdemarendures , Bring him with us to the ship . It 's a shame to waste such promising centurion material . But he will make a goodexample forthe others , - @ @ [ Tribal ] - [ People Chattering , Laughing ] Would you like to try ? Mm . Yes . - Sam ! - [ Yelling ] Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! - Everybodyfight ! - Surrender , or they die ! Both ofthem ! Valdemarhadmore to offerme thanjust a berth on a boat to nowhere , Sorry . [ Nero ] I gathershe 's readyto launch at the next high tide , Teach mymen how to sail her andyourlives will be saved , You , however , can expect no such kindness , The great Neptune will require a sacrifice if my voyages are to prosper . And what better candidate than my first true enemy in this world ? Make itslow , The profit is all in the pain . Keep her apart from the rest . [ Man ] Ah ! Come on ! [ Flavius ] With this , we do not need to relyon the wind , Andno one on the river can have anything like this , I want to see it work . [ Scoffs ] Now , which ofyou wants to be the next crew member to die ? Once lit , the energy converts to heat , which creates steam , which creates pressure , which turns the wheel , Good , Have the strongest prisoners load the remaining supplies , Store the others in the hold , - The hold wasn 't built for people . - The weak will die , the strong will survive . I fail to see your problem . Oh . Oh , what my legions could have achieved ... with metal hearts beating inside their ships . Everywhere this boat sets anchor , soldiers will be added to my armies , slaves to myworkforce . You see , the only cure for anarchy is the firm hand and iron will ... ofa leaderwith a vision , Forthe good ofthe citizens , Rome must be resurrected . Make him loadtheship with the others , Less than 1 2 hours to high tide . Hold your breath long enough at the end ... and you mightjust get to see me waving you good-bye . No ! No ! Come on ! No . [ Screams ] Everyone ! You must be still . Be still . Be still . Breathe slowly . Saveyour strength , oryou will die . Areyou all right ? Ifwe live , we 'll build another boat and sail in the opposite direction . They 're not gonna let us live . You and I both know that . The first time I was murdered , I hadn 't the strength to go down fighting . Now I do . Areyou with me ? Only ifwe get the chance . Enough talk ! Move it ! Sam . Sam . Move ! Now !

I can onlyhope she escaped , Mali , you diedin a hold like this , didn 'tyou ? It was all for nothing . This is how you humans comfort each other ? There was a distinct shortage of comfort in Birkenau . In the end , when all was stripped away , the onlywords of comfort that meant anything to me were these- - I am still alive . [ Scoffs ] Say it . I am still alive ? Again . I am still alive . [ Man ] Is everythingready ? Nero 's coming on board , [ Man # 2 ] Yes , sir , The boat is ready . How long till high tide ? Less than an hour . And thewoman ? She awaits you in the captain 's quarters . I do notwish to be disturbed . Ah . Good girl . Look , ifanything bad happens , go toyour hiding spot . I likeyour spirit . The more they evade us , the morewe admire them . I know I intrigueyou , though you wish I didn 't . You 're upset aboutyourfriend . I did not order his death lightly . But I must establish my authority ifl am to bring peace to this world . Oh , is thatwhatyou 're after ? You revolt me ! Oh . You misunderstand me . I do not claim to be perfect ! How did you get out ofthat one ? - Good things come in small packages . - Gwen freed you ? She 's safe ? Yeah , she 's okay . Where 's Alice ? All right , listen up . The tide 's almost in . Sowe 're gonna launch the boat right away . Hale , it 's too risky , Theydon 't knowhowtosailheryet , That 's ouradvantage , Sam , this is ourwindow of opportunity . There might not be another one . Now , ifwe 're gonna make it through this thing alive , we have got toworktogether . Now , areyou in or areyou out ? I 've gotta know right now . [ Man ] Come on , Sam , I 'm in . Okay . Now , ifwe want to live , ifwe want freedom , everyone that steps foot on that deck is gonna have to fight for it . And maybe to the death , ifnecessary . Areyou ready ? Areyou ready ? [ Man , Softly ] Yes , Areyou ready ? - Yes . - Areyou ready ? - [ All Whispering ] Yes . - All right . We 're going for the ropes . The men on the ground won 't be a factor oncewe 're underway . We have got to come upwith a diversion , something to hold them in the beginning . - Leave that to us . - Good . - Lev , can you handle a sword ? - There 's a first time for everything . Get two men , meet me on top . Mali , you go for the ropes and then meet us as well . All right , upyou go . [ Man ] Okay , let 's do it , [ NeckCracks ] Let 's go . One at a time . - Psst . - What areyou doing up there ? I told you to stay put . All right , you can stay and help Mali with the ropes . Now , go ! Go ! Lev , I 'm going after Alice . Good luck . I was inexperienced . Impatient . I lacked thejudgment ofthe elder emperors . But I 've learned from my mistakes . And now I know I need a strong empress by my side ... to steady me , to teach me ... compassion , an emotion I was never allowed to develop in Rome . Choose someone else . [ Screams ] Look , you have secrets . I don 't know whatyou 're talking about . You have such pain behind your eyes . Who leftyou ? Forget him . Consider me instead . I can giveyou everything . Everything except love . [ Nero ] Ah , love , The ultimate challenge . So Neptune spatyou from his waters . - Don 't . - Then drop it . Do it . Oh , do it . [ Man ] Everything 's secured here . [ Chattering ] These had betterwork , Monat . Theywill . Sword . Kick it . You see , the true leader will always sacrifice the one ... for the good ofthe many , no matterwhat his feelings . Ready , Clear ! That 's the difference between us , Hale , That 's whyi 'm destined to rule , and you 're destined to perish . Clear ! Ooh . - Stay here . - Not on your nellie . - Run for the ship ! - Stop them ! They 're heading forthe boat ! Mali , help ! [ Hale ] Mali , quick ! Cut the last ropes , [ Man ] Holdon ! Unbelievable . We 've launched . Monat , get anotherrocket , Go to the engine room . Fire up the boiler . [ Yelling ] You nevertold me about explosives , Sam . - Hell ofa launch party . - The engine room . We gotta get out ofhere . [ Hale ] Watch out forNero , He 's stillout there , [ Yelling ] The sails . The current 'spushing us towards the rocks , The pressure 's up . Here it goes . You ever done any sailing ? I 'm from Danzig . We learn to sail before we can pee standing up . All right , good . Tie it offand take thewheel . Right . You should go below deck where it 's safe . Go on ! Go ! Right now ! Dear God . Oh , dear God . Give me strength . Monat ! What now ? [ Grunting ] Howare we ? Full starboard ! Full starboard ! I have almost no control without the engine . I 'm on it . - Sam ! We need power now , orwe 're gonna hit the rocks . - What about the sails ? It 's keeping us from drifting , but that 's about it . We 're doing all we can . We got a kink in here somewhere . - Not a technologically sound idea . - Necessity is the mother ofinvention . [ Hale ] Hit it ! It 's working ! Wait ! Enough already . She 's coming around . [ Lev ] I 've got her , We 're in the clear , Good going . Sam , there might be moreVandals on the boat . You go forward . I 'll sweep aft . Stay put ! Watch yourself . We 're almost clear , Hale , be careful , - Your fight 's with me . - I suppose it is . But I askedmyself , " Whybother ? " " What an artist the world loses in me . " Famous last words , right ? You 've studied me . How gratifying . Yeah , I 've studied you . I 've studied Nero the emperor , Nero the coward . According to history , you poisoned yourwayto the top , and then , underyourfine leadership , thewhole empire fell . Well , history is mistaken . You were thesadend to theAugustan dynasty andthe endofRome , No ! No ! I tried to resurrect a crumbling republic . Myown mother , mywife Octavia- - they all plotted against me ... and against Rome . I died fighting against false accusations . You died on the run , and then you killed yourself becauseyou were afraid to faceyour enemies . That wasyourlegacy , Bevery , very careful . Give him yourweapon . - I said ... - Come on ! give him yourweapon . Move ! I 'll die fighting false accusations again , ifthat 's what the gods demand ofme . So Neptunewill have my sacrifice . [ Spits ] The first person you have ever killed . Yeah . Yeah , up close . Hewon 't be the last . Not byfar . Nero 's dead . Dropyourweapons . Drop it ! Move ! Move ! You can jump orwe can push you . [ Yelling ] [ Laughing ] We 've done it ! Wewon ! Wewon ! Whoo-hoo ! You foughtwell . - Areyou okay ? - Areyou ? It looks likewe 're going with you whetheryou like it or not . I guess so . [ Man ] Yes ! Goodwork ! [ Knocking ] You were right . Itwas one hell ofa launch party . Come on in . Well , here 's to life on the river . - Well , they all wantyou to be- - - Sam , I did what I had to do to get us out ofthere . - This isn 't my boat . I didn 't build her . - I 'm not asking you to buy her , Hale . Truth is , all I reallywant is to be the pilot ofthe Go ForBroke , Mess about on the river . I don 't know , maybe- - maybe find myself a little adventure . Mess about on the river , huh ? Kind oflike Tom Sawyer ? - Uh-huh . - I don 't know ifAunt Polly would approve ofthat . But Ibet Mark Twain would , OrSam Clemens , as he was known to his friends back in the days when he was , piloting that steamboat up and down Ole 'Miss , Mark Twain . I haven 't heard that name in years . Born under a comet , died under a comet , partial to meteors , Come on , Sam . Why don 'tyou tell them the truth ? Whydon 'tyou tell them whoyou reallyare ? Doyou miss your family , Hale ? I do . But they know someone named MarkTwain . When I look back on my earthly life , I realized that I was the most happiest ... when I was plain old Sam the boat pilot . Maybe Iknewwho I was andwho I wasn 't , Now I figure that 's why I 'm here , to find out ... why that was so . I 'd sure appreciate it ifyou let it stay that way ... Captain , Let 's head upriver . [ No Audible Dialogue ] Theirjourney has begun . As you said itwould . Butwill it be completed in time ? Will it be completed at all ? That , none ofus can foresee .

 You really ! Are you joking ? Episode 4 No , I 'm not ! Chun-hyang ! Hey , what are you doing ? Ouch , it hurts ! Hey ! Did I do it on purpose ? It was an accident ! Accident ! ? ! I knew you were ignorant , but this is too much ! - Are you finished ? - No , I 'm not ! I know you two are fighting but what about me ? You get out of here ! Good Luck ! Hey , where 's Chun-hyang ? I need her to go with me to meet the president of the entertainment company . I heard that the president was really famous . - Yeah . - You think he 'll meet with you ? Chun-hyang made this all happen for me . The play , the props ... It was so she could get me and that president together ! If I become an entertainer , it will all be because of Chun-hyang . Director Baik , hurry up and get the car ! Mister ! I enjoyed the play . You 're a great actor . It was a flop . But , were you really that important of a person ? I didn 't see you that way . That 's really incredible . Really ? I didn 't see you that way either . You are pretty incredible yourself . Mister ! What should I do with the props ? I 'll send someone to pick them up . I 'm sorry I 'm in the family 's dinner . Oh , don 't be sorry , you 're just like family . Ever since she was young she was our neighbor , so she 's just like family . Oh , to Mong-ryong , Chae-rin is just like an older sister . So I guess to Chun-hyang , Chae-rin is going to be a sister-in-law . If Chae-rin is Chun-hyang 's sister-in-law , then is Chae-rin 's Mom is Mong-ryong 's mother-in-law ? Chun-hyang , Chun-hyang , Chun-hyang , you 're so lucky , you have two mother-in-laws . Holy ... That 's a bread knife . Chae-rin , I already cut it down for you , so eat this one . Thank you . Have a bite . Is it good ? Mom , you eat a lot , too ! Oh , my son-in-law , you eat a lot , too . Oh , your lips are torn . Sorry ? Your passionate kiss made your lips tear . Mom ... The two of you are so passionate , how could your lips not tear ? Mom ... ! What ? Eat your meal ! Please , eat , Mrs. Lee ! - Miss sister-in-law , you too . - I had a wonderful dinner . I had a wonderful dinner , too . Chae-rin , I 'll see you soon . - Goodbye , I 'll see you soon . - Goodbye Chae-rin . - Bye - Goodbye Mom ! Why don 't you go with us ? Chae-rin , it was just an accident . You know that , right ? - Don 't misunderstand . - I know Anyway , is your lip okay ? Let me see . Are you sure she is just the girl next door ? They look so dangerous ! What is so dangerous ? She 's more of a sister than a real sister . Don 't worry about it . Let 's not misunderstand each other . It wasn 't a kiss but an accident . It was my fault but I don 't feel very good about it either . Why do you feel bad ? A wrecked car like you crashed into a luxurious sedan like me . Oh , it still hurts ... Who would doubt you being Mazinger Z ? Her lip must be made of steel , too . Let 's not act like we know each other at school , too , okay ? I 'm the one who should be saying that ! I 'm taking care of Class 6 too , because Mr. Son Jun-sik left for a business trip . - Why do we have to join classes with them ? - If I knew , I would 've skipped class ... - Is there a sport boys and girls can do together ? - Yes , there is . - What is it ? - Dodge ball . - Then you 're going to play dodge ball . Hey , throw the ball ! Mong-ryong ! Are you throwing the ball softly because it 's your wife ? - What ? - What I meant was ... Give me the ball ! What the ... Stop it ! " Sincerity can move heaven . " The flower finally blossomed . Who was that ? ! Are you the king of dodge ball ? Why did you kick the ball ? Whose fault was it ? Stomp harder ! You can stomp on only one while I can stomp on two . No way ! This is not something that requires power but skill . First you should aim correctly and control the power . Did you see ? - Don 't make me laugh . - You want to bet ? - Let 's see who can stomp on it to make it the flattest . - Bet ? Okay . I win . Give me your head . - One more time ? - Of course ! Hello ! I 've brought the props for Chun-hyang . Thank you . And I 'd like to talk about my future with you , if you would just give me a moment . Listen , I don 't know what Chun-hyang told you but I don 't have free time . I thought that ... If it 's you , you could make my dreams come true . Director Baik , take care of the rest . Are you Dan Hee Han ? Do you know me ? I was the one who called you to the film location . I saw your videotape too . I 'm the director of the Dodo Entertainment Agency . You know what jewelry cutting is , right ? There are so many stones on the street . I 'm the one who finds the best stone and cuts it to give it the most beautiful shine . How much cutting will I need ? A cut here and a cut there ... Right , right ... Maybe three thousand dollars . That much ? It 's not easy to become an entertainer ! Otherwise , everyone would become an entertainer . If the entertainment agency invests 100 , you should at least invest 10 . I agree . You seem to understand me well . I really like you . - Let 's do it well . - Yes . Thanks for the drink . What ? Sure . Hey ! What are you doing ? Why are you staring at me like that ? He 's tricking you ! He asked you for money . Why are you getting involved in my business and exaggerating ! ? ! All you have is power . Mind you own business ! - Iron arms and iron legs , can you project them too ? - Whatever ... Oh , Chae-rin , are you in Namwon ? Now ? Sure I have time . I 'll be right there . - Put the trash box in its place . - You put it back ! Why are you still here ? I think I lost my wallet . What shall I do ? I knew it watching you jumping around like that ... You did a good job . You 're so ignorant ... What shall I do ? You should look in the trash cans . I 'm leaving now ... She must be going through all the trash like a dummy ... Where did it go ... What are you going to do if I find it for you ? You 're not going to meet Chae-rin ? Today is not the only day . Hey , it 's cold , let 's go . You don 't even have that much money in your wallet . No , my father 's picture is in it . It 's the only one I have . Hey ! I found it ! Bring one for me too ... - We 're home . - You 're finally home . Sit down . Chae-rin ! You said you had something important to do , were you two together ? - You two use separate rooms , too . - Yeah . Isn 't this what I gave you when you graduated from junior high ? It is ... and it 's the same picture . You still have this ? Don 't misunderstand , I 'm fine now . I can return this to you too . Mong-ryong , are you still uncomfortable with me ? No ... I just don 't want you to be uncomfortable because I like you . Mong-ryong , when I got dumped , you said you were grateful that you were able to like me and I thought about that . Thanks for liking me . I don 't know why I didn 't realize how wonderful that was . Chae-rin . So , you don 't have to return this . Say something while you 're eating . This is very unique . It 's really pretty . It 's pretty ? You want it ? Thanks . But do they sell these ? Where did you buy it ? Oh , Chun-hyang made it for me . Really ? It seems she made it especially for you , is it okay you give it to me ? It 's okay . I 'll ask her to make another one . Is it all right ? - It 's okay . - Thanks . Is she on a march ? Why is she walking so fast ? Oh , my feet hurt , maybe it 's because of the new shoes . - Does your leg hurt ? - Yeah I can make another one ? What do you mean ? I 'll be shot before I make another one . Hey , Are you trying to choke me to death ? - You almost got hit by that motorcycle ! - I saw it ! You 're lying ! I saw you not paying attention ! I saw it ! Hey , hey ! You 're pulling on my clothes ! If you feel bad about me pulling on you to save you , then pull on me too ! - Who said that was the reason ? - Then what is it ? I didn 't want to be petty and say it but how could you give someone else something I gave you ? What ? That 's what you 're mad about ? If you didn 't like it , you should 've said so . You said it was okay back then . Did I say it was okay ? You said it was okay . Han Dan-hee . When is the date you talked about ? It 's been postponed . I have a part-time job . I 'll be going first . Why is she suddenly working ? How do I know ? She must be trying to make money . You did ? Oh , no . You did a great job . Even if I was an intern you 're going to include me in the farewell party , right ? So , is the filming all done ? Yeah , by the weekend . Oh , I guess I won 't be able to come down so often to Namwon . It 's too bad . But , you know that phone attachment ? This ? Yeah ? No ... it looks good . Chun-hyang 's really good at making those . Really ? Let 's eat ! Chae-rin ! Look , there are so many nice ones ! - This is pretty too ! - It 's okay ! I 'll buy you one . This is much nicer than that one . Why ? Did Chun-hyang tell you to get this back ? Actually , she made it so I would get better grades . I guess she feels a little bad . Can you give it back ? - What 's this fish bun for ? - Fish ? It 's a Golden Carp ! Look , it 's golden ... I bought it from the best place in Namwon ! Aren 't you going to eat it ? Then , I 'll eat it with Ji-hyuk . I got this back . Can 't you see it ? What is it ? It 's what my wife made me . When did I give it to you ? Chae-rin gave it to you . I had to apologize and got it back from her , why are you like this ? You 're a large-eyed Herring and obstinate . That 's right I am . But do you even know what a Herring is ? You 're really petty , Chun-hyang ! But what is a Herring ? A Herring is a fish ? Welcome . How much would you like ? - Fill it up , please . - Okay . You know I 'm giving you more for this than it 's worth , right ? Yes , thank you . You tell Dan-Hee you 're lending this to her and give it to her . What is it ? What 's all this money for ? She 's working like crazy to save up $ 3,000 . I don 't want to see her suffer , so I sold my motorcycle . Why does she need so much money ? - She said she needed it if she wanted to become an entertainer . - What ? - Hey , what 's this ? - You better get over here ! Hey , what 's this ? Hey ! Mister , will you really make Dan-Hee a star if she gives you $ 3,000 ? What ? If she gives you that money , will you give her plastic surgery to make her pretty , make her a star , put her in a movie and commercials ? Are you now asking for a favor with money ? It seems it 's your specialty to shock , confuse and belittle others . It 's no longer fun . What ? $ 3,000 ? If that money will stop you from bothering me again , I 'll give it to you . Director Baik , take them out of here . It seems $ 3,000 is nothing to you , but to someone else , it 's money they have to work to death for and for another person , they had to sell their most precious item to get it . My friend has dreamt of becoming a star since she was 5 . So , she put all her trust in what you said . It is terrible and petty to take advantage of someone else 's dreams and hopes . Let 's go . Director Baik , what is going on ? What did you tell them ? Do you think $ 3,000 is nothing ? You were ready to give it to him ! I 'm that desperate . I can go back right now and beg that president . You got married so that you wouldn 't have to give up your dreams . Why can 't you understand me ? Because what I thought would be the easier road is harder . Chun-hyang ... Chun-hyang , is that you ? Oh , what are you doing here ? I had something to do with my friend . Oh , anyway , I had wanted to see you once . Why ? For what ? I 'm sorry about that last time . Knowing it was a gift from you , I shouldn 't have taken it from Mong-ryong . That wasn 't your fault . Mong-ryong doesn 't know how to be considerate of others . That 's not true . The gift I gave him when he graduated from junior high school , he still has it . That 's how considerate he is . I 'm sure he gave it to me because I kept asking him . I put soft-hearted Mong-ryong in an uncomfortable position . I didn 't know Mong-ryong was so soft-hearted . I returned it because Mong-ryong seemed so concerned about you getting hurt . Mong-ryong has no idea . Is he still following her around ? I knew it from the beginning but it still makes me feel bad and I know there 's no loyalty between us , but I still feel betrayed . Chun-hyang ! That means you like ... Nevermind . That 's not a good thing . An answer to a fling is another fling . I 'm going to pull in the line I 've been working on . What line ? You are so pretty ! What ? A group date ? How can Chun-hyang do this to me ? How could she take Dan-Hee to that ? She 's ready to have a fling . That woman , really ! I went to visit France last month . Oh , say something in French ! Hey , tell them about your trip to New York . But how can all three of you be so beautiful ? Shouldn 't such beauties already have boyfriends ? Someone with so little taste ... Chun-hyang , I know how to read palms , I 'll read yours . Yeah ! Yeah ! Hey , let 's go and have some fun at a night club , huh ? Let 's toast to Director Ho-taik Im 's film making it to Cannes , Venice , and to the Oscars ! Cheers ! Director , you suffered a lot making this film in the cold . I feel very good about this film . You have great talent in planning . You did a great job . Every staff member did a great job ! All the costumes and accessories were perfect for the film . Thank you . Everyone really did a great job . Let 's all make a toast . To our film becoming a jackpot ! Cheers ! Oh my gosh ! What are you doing ? I know you like it . Mong-ryong ! You 've been bothering my woman for a while now . Your woman ? Who 's your woman ? You cheese ball . Get out of here . What ? You little ! Hey ! Mong-ryong ! What are you doing ? Mister ! What are you ? Are you okay ? I 'm okay but since we argued that last time and now that you 've saved me , I 'm grateful but also embarrassed . Don 't you feel the same way ? Let 's just leave it at both of us being sorry and embarrassed . I was wrong that last time , I 'm sorry - Director Baik ... I 'm sorry ... I 'm really sorry ... Will you forgive me ? I 'm really sorry ... Please stop , it 's okay . You just need to be sorry to her . But I don 't think we 're the only ones who should be sorry ... Is it okay for high school students to be here ? Sorry ? Oh , that 's ... Let 's get out of here . I have something to give you too . Hey , now , where are you going ? Now , it 's an old man ? Chun-hyang , why don 't you stop ? What are you doing ? Who are you to interfere ? Do you know each other ? If we do , we do . Who are you ? Me ? Chun-hyang is my wife . Do kids these days call the girls they like , their wives ? No , I 'm her husband . She 's a married woman . A married woman ? Didn 't you say you were a high school student ? I am . I 'm a high school student and a married woman ... Mong-ryong ! You wild woman ! This is all your fault ! So , why did you get involved ? You made it into a bigger problem . Hey , I 'm the one who beat up that cheesy guy ! Did that other man do anything else but give him a look ? That 's why you 're a child . You can 't discriminate between heaven and earth , you just hit first . The power to stop all things with just one look ! That 's a real man and adult . Power in a look ? Is he the famous Robot 28 ? Does light come out of his eyes , too ? You 're not even at my level for a conversation . - That ... ! - Hey , don 't get mad . At her age , of course she 's going to want to meet other boys . She must feel bad about not being able to do other things now that she 's married . That 's not it ! She did it on purpose to make me feel bad . So ... do you feel bad ? What ? She 's doing that on purpose ! Ugh , you 're going to get it , Chun-hyang ! Chae-rin , I 'm going to go . Hey ! Mazinger Z ! Isn 't this a little rude to the person who fought for you ? Forget it ! Forget what ? I 'm going to tell everyone you went to the night club . Me ? Chun-hyang 's my wife . No , I 'm her husband . She 's a married woman . An affair ? Who started it first ? Oh , I 've got to stop caring ... That 's right . Tomorrow 's dad 's memorial ... I have to go to his gravesite . I have to take Mong-ryong too ... Urgh ! Why did we have to fight now ? The power to stop things with his eyes ! That 's a real man and an adult . Hey , knock ! What ? Listen ... I 'm going to make ramen , you want some ? You go on and enjoy . But do you think ramen will be enough ? You should add sesame oil and butter so it 'll be nice and cheesy and have all that power in your eyes . Forget it . You obstinate large-eyed herring ! Hey ! I know that a herring is a fish ! Then what 's obstinate ? You little ... Obstinate ? Obstinate is adamant . Then what 's adamant ? - I 'll be back . - Be back early . Okay . Oh , my back . Mom ? Where did she go ? I don 't know . She said she had to go out . She 's not going to meet that eye man , right ? My personal statement should be here somewhere ... " Dad 's Memorial " How important was his other appointment that he couldn 't make it to his father-in-law 's memorial ? He has a meeting about his entrance . You know his situation with grades ... I wanted to show him his son-in-law ... I guess your father doesn 't have that luck . Mother ! I was late buying these flowers . I heard you had a meeting at school . Sorry ! I moved it to next week . Mother sent this to you . Oh , I 'm so grateful . Did you buy a ticket ? Of course ... Your father must be waiting , hurry ! What are you doing ? Hurry up ! You sit with your husband . No , I 'm going to sit here ! What are you doing ? Chun-hyang 's father ... Your son-in-law is here . The daughter you loved so much , Chun-hyang grew up well and got married too . Oh , you ... you should 've lived a long time with me and met your son-in-law and your grandchildren ... You 're a bad man for leaving ... ! My mother does this once every year . She says she has to let out all the tears she held in for the year with my dad so she can endure another year ... I used to cry with her when I was young , but I don 't now . If I cried too , my father would be left here alone worrying about us . Do you feel sorry for me ? Then be good ! I don 't feel sorry for you so why should I be good ? Anyway , thanks for coming . I 'm not that rude . Where is she ? Mom ... Mom ! Hey , call her ! I can 't help it if something urgent came up ... The next bus ? The bus I 'm on is the last bus ... You know that grandma 's house , right ? Go sleep there tonight and you can take the bus tomorrow morning . I 'm hanging up , bye ! Mom , you drive me crazy ! Oh , I 'm so tired ! Walk a little slower . Is this the right house ? Yeah ... Grandma ... Grandma ... Grandma ! Oh ... is that you Chun-hyang ? - Grandma ! - Yes , dear ... You must be hungry so sit down and eat . Grandma , did you know we were coming ? Huh ? You think I can see the future ? But you had all the food ready ? I didn 't know . I really didn 't know . You must be tired , rest ! Grandma . After eating , I 'm going to go to your room . I can 't sleep when someone else is in the room with me . There 's only one empty room so the two of you go in there . Sorry ? And I sleep so deeply that I don 't hear a thing , so don 't worry about me . Chae-rin , I can 't make it back . We came for my father-in-law 's memorial ... and the bus ... got cut off , so , I 'm stuck here on the mountain ! I can 't go anywhere . So , you and Chun-hyang are alone on the mountain together ? - You want me to come and get you ? - You don 't know where this is ... Mong-ryong ! Hello ! Hello ! Hello ! Hello ! Oh , really ... The sweet potatoes are ready . It 's hot ! Burn ! Burn ! Burn ! Burn ! Burn ! Burn ! Burn ! Burn ! Burn ! Burn ! Lee Mong-ryong ! What are you doing ? What is this ! Hey ! Hey ! I really want to go to the bathroom ! What ? Chun-hyang are you there ? Yeah ! Oh , a guy with so much fear . Hey ! Chun-hyang , I 'm scared so say something . Hey ... Chun-hyang . Stop playing around ... Lee Mong-ryong ! Dummy ! On a mountain , people are scarier than ghosts , don 't you know that ? It all depends on the person . What 's scary about you ? I 'm not scary ? You want me to be scary ? Lee Mong-ryong ! What are you doing ? Are you a little scared now ? You want me to be scarier ? Hey ! Can 't you take a joke ? It seems you don 't know how scary I can be , if you do that again , you 're dead ! You want to eat this ? It looks really good . Okay . Look at the stars . There are so many . They 're really pretty . They say a star is born each time a good person dies . Too bad for you . There 's nothing you really want to do ? Yeah . You say that so easily . I envy you sometimes . I think having a goal would be great . You set a goal , too . You say that so easily . I don 't know what it is I 'm supposed to do ... I have the motivation to follow through if only I had a goal . - It should be ready . Oh , it 's hot ! - Did it burn you ? Oh , geez ... I 'll go in first . Come in later after you take out the fire . Hey ! I 'm going to eat all of this ! Director Baik , is everything ready ? Yes , the car is waiting . Set up an early meeting tomorrow . We 're going to review all the new synopsis . No ... let 's stay one more night and leave tomorrow . I have someone to see . Yes ... We found it ! We found it , Mister ! - How much is it ? - It 's $ 30 . How can it be that expensive ? Cut it in half and give it to me for $ 15 . Now what ! Oh , my gosh ! So , the two of you slept together again ? Hey ! Be quiet ! What , everyone knows you two are married . And , and what ... ? What do you mean ? That 's it . That 's it ? You told ghost stories and roasted sweet potatoes ... You two played house ... Why can 't you two cover anymore ground ? Even with just that , I 'm embarrassed to look at him ! You have no idea ! Mister ! What brings you here ? - Are you finished ? - Yes . I 'm on my way to Seoul . Do you have some time ? What 's this ? That man . That 's the night club eye man ! - Why is he here looking for Chun-hyang again ? - I don 't know . He 's the president of a famous entertainment agency . Do you think he wants to make Chun-hyang into a star ? Chun-hyang ? Is there a reason to bankrupt Korea 's movie industry ? Your husband must not be very happy with me . He 's not very happy with anyone . Don 't worry about it . My ill-fated destiny has made me take him as my husband ! You said you couldn 't have everything you wanted right ? If you really want something , shouldn 't you be fortunate once a while ? Oh ... this ... Are you really giving this to me ? Next time we meet , we 'll meet as business partners . President Chun-hyang . I 'll buy your first item . Well , after I look over your proposal . Wow , it 's so pretty . Chun-hyang can 't sing ... She has no talent ... She only has blind motivation ... Maybe he 's trying to take advantage of an innocent girl and take all our money ... Chae-rin ! Mong-ryong ! What brings you here ? It feels so weird , since we were young I was always first before you ... I went to school first . I went through adolescence first ... and I thought of course I would get married first ... So , do you feel bad ? A little ... I 'm upset that I didn 't even know you were making this kind of decision . Moreover , I 'm upset that I didn 't know what kind of person you were earlier ... Chae-rin ... I 'm going to Seoul today . When I get there , I don 't want to talk to you anymore . What ? I can 't see you anymore ! It 's burdensome to see you . Why ? Why can 't you see me ? Because , I feel bad . And because of that I get selfish . And I can stand that , but it makes me mad . Son ! What 's wrong with you lately ? What are you so serious about ? Is it because of Chae-rin ? Chae-rin says she can 't see me . Why ? She says when she sees me , she feels envious and mad . That ... that ... Chae-rin ... she likes you . That means she really likes you . When she sees you , she wants you but because she can 't have you , she gets mad . She really likes you . What , you 're going to see her now ? Can 't I go ? No . Don 't you see me here next to you ? You ? I 'm sitting here as your wife . I can 't leave you right now . You know that right ? Right ? Yeah ... we promised . You hold off on running to Chae-rin and run somewhere else . Where ? You can run towards the school Chae-rin attends . Hangook University ? Yes . When you have a target , you run hard to it . I won 't stop you from going there , so , make a run for it . With your grades now , it 's going to take everything you 've got . " GO Hangook University " Winter ... Spring ... Summer ... Fall ... Dan-Hee , you are prettier without make-up . Only those without natural beauty put all that stuff on . A jewel that is polished , shines better . What are you doing - you pick one too . - Now that we 're college students , we need to have at least the basic make-up . - I 'm okay . Is it because you 're worried about Mong-ryong ? He 's number 3 on the waiting list , right ? It must really be tense . It 's more comfortable to have just plainly be rejected . That 's something to be proud off . You must be feeling great ! Yeah , I do . But even if he does go to college , that 's worrisome too . If you two go to Seoul , you two will have to live together . Are you guys going to continue to live like siblings ? Whether we become like siblings , or like strangers ... I have no idea . What does that mean ? Hey , are the two of you having problems ? No ... Since you 're on the waiting list , there 's still hope ! It must be nice since you 've already been accepted . It 'll work out . Do your best and leave it to heaven ! Since you 've done your best , leave it to heaven . Let 's be strong ! Thanks ... What are you doing ? I thought maybe it 's broken . Honey , Mong-ryong 's not going to get cut , right ? If he went up from 30th to 3rd place , then it 's all done . That 's why I said he should 've applied to several places ... and not just to Hangook University ... so stubborn ... You said you had a good dream last night . Don 't worry . He ... hello ? If it goes in , I 'm in ... Chae-rin ... One more time . If it goes in , he 's in ... Wow ! He 's in ! Really ! I 'm in ! It 's really an acceptance . I confirmed it in Seoul and came down . Mong-ryong , you 've been accepted . I got in ? Yes ! Lee Mong-ryong , congratulations on your acceptance ! Chae-rin ! The sky , the earth , the black , the yellow , the house , the house ... Chun-hyang , come closer . Do you want to hold my hand ? Then recite me the Analects of Confucius . I recited it to you . Do you want to kiss me ? Then read me the Works of Mencius . If you pass the exam in first place ... , A kiss will only be the start ... Pass the exam in first place ... ?

 Ah , there you are . We 're dividing spoils from the depository . These were set aside for you to choose from and I understand that ... She is burnt . She 's badly crippled because of our desires . Let go ! Was all this wealth worth it ? Course not you blue bitch , but what 's done is done . Just as long as we 're wealthy , huh ? May as well put it to good use . Crais and Talyn have located some kind of surgeon . A healer species . We 're almost there . We 're all choosing one or two items we want . The rest is to pay any fee for Moya 's remedy . I 'm sorry Rygel , I misjudged you . Ha ! It 's becoming your career . Now listen , John . Be smart . See the situation for what it is . Screw you ! No , John . Not this time . We 've reached the end of the old . The beginning of the new . I am in control . I am in control of me ! No more , John . Screw you ! The reverse is more likely . Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop it ! I can 't , I can 't ! There 's no one here , John . You made yourself bleed . Scorpius ! Scorpius ! Scorpius ! Yes . Listen ! He put a neurotracer chip in your brain . You know this . You know he isn 't really here . I see him ! I see him ! - Well , fight it . Listen to me . We 've reached the surgical facility . We 're going to see if they can remove the chip . I have to smash him . No . Scorpius isn 't really there . John , I need you to face reality as it is . It 's ridiculous , I know . She cannot see us , John . What 's happening to me ? You know what 's happening to you . Scorpius put that frelling chip in your brain . Aeryn , what do you see , in the mirror ? What do you see ? There is no mirror . There is no Scorpius . Look . You must confront your fears with strength . You 're right , Aeryn . There 's no Scorpius here . Mmm ... There 's only me . Yeah . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . A radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship , a living ship , full of strange alien life-forms . Help me . Listen , please . Is there anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm being hunted by an insane military commander . I 'm doing everything I can . I 'm just looking for a way home . If it wasn 't serious , they wouldn 't have called us , would they ? Now when you 're done , the big picture . - I don 't like him . He 's rumored to be one of the best healers in the Uncharted Territories . No , not him . His sleazy confederate Gunsik . Grun-chlk . Splendid hearing . Doc fixed it . Can he save Moya ? Oh , looks good . He 's splendid with infections . He 'll make up a mixture that will be absorbed through these scarred areas , and then a couple of applications , keep the patient sedated , you 're laughing . How much ? Oh , by my calculations , let 's say , ah , exchange equivalent with the meter and all of that , 12,000 kretmers . Outrageous ! Uh , just a microt . Listen , britchka ... I don 't know . What do you think ? I don 't know that we have any choice . She 's got to get fixed , but this is crazy . Or you think you can run that facility without me ? Shh . He always thinks I undercharge . He 's a greedy bastard . It 's a species trade . Now I 'm sorry to have to do this to you , but he insists . That 's 15,000 kretmers . I could buy a whole new ship for that . Yeah . I had to let an aunt die once because we couldn 't afford to fix her . I 'm going to go and assess our funds . If you don 't make her better , we 're going to get you ! Let me introduce you ... Chiana ! Leave him alone . Why do you wear that mask ? Dr. Diagnosan intuits disease through inhalation , here . Very , very sensitive . Even the siljot bacteria in your beautiful hair would kill him if he got it in his nose and his mouth at the same time . Ah , Crichton , a word if I may . Not now , Rygel . Now works for me . So , if you haven 't chosen a bauble yet ... Rygel , shut up . If I take you to him ... - I don 't want to have them repaired . He 's a surgeon . We have currency . I 'm sure that we ... - Father , you 're not listening to me . All right Rygel , I 'll take care of it . Well , he just tried to force this jinka stone down my throat . What 'd I just say ? - Ohh ! I can 't see why you wouldn 't want your tankas restored . I mean , as a Luxan ... I 'm only half Luxan . And for many cycles , I didn 't even want to be that . You cut yourself . You mutilated your own tenkas . You hate me that much ? It 's okay . It doesn 't hurt anymore , Father . Hey , D 'Argo ... What ? ! Sorry , Chiana , I , uh ... A moment ago , you said 17,500 . Expenses , experience , expertise . The meter is still running . 20,000 is the rate . I 'll pay 18 and not a kretmer more . Got it ? Oh ! I hate to negotiate like this , but I do find it cuts through the critada . Put him down , Greenchalk . Grun-chlk . This is business . I have the supply . I make the demand . It 's all right , Doctor . The family are in denial . I won 't let them hurt each other . Take the 20,000 , before it goes up . Crichton ? Um , Pilot says you 're reconfiguring a Comms signal outside his control . I want to eavesdrop on Crais ' radio traffic without him knowing about it . I still don 't trust him here . Crais and Talyn saved our lives . They saved yours . Look , Aeryn , if you 're worried about the ... inside my head , don 't . He 's under house arrest . Remember what you said ? Strength . That 's great , John , but you need to stop what you 're doing . Aeryn , as long as I stay busy , he leaves me alone . Sometimes if I sing , he leaves me alone . Dun , da-da , da , da , dun , da-da , da , da ... Dun , da-da , da , da ... Dun , da-da , da . Look , once the Diagnosan 's finished with Moya , he 's going to take a look at you . It won 't help . Hmm ... I am reminded at this point of a word that you actually brought to this vessel . Hope . I would be lost without you . Then you 'll never be lost . No matter what happens , you have worked your way into my heart . You 've shown me that I have one . I love you . I love you , too . Mmm ... You are so my girl . Now , listen to me . Officer Sun cannot be blackmailed or enticed . If she is to join us , it would have to be of her own volition . Agreed . If she joins us freely , we will tell her the truth . What 's that coming through ? Identify the source of the signal ! Play it loud ! It 's a Peacekeeper signal . Crais says it 's a special pulse code , known only to Captain 's rank and above . He 's never been a Peacekeeper . Must be the neuro-circuit that Scorpius implanted in his brain . What are we going to do when we find it ? - You ? Nothing . It 's too dangerous . Dad ... No ! Stop what you 're doing . Relax , boy . You 're not in any danger . Scorpius only wants me . My father says you 're in no condition to make that decision . And you 're in no condition to stop me . Step back ! Oh , my . You really should have brought a pulse rifle . Like father , like son . Hardly . How do you feel ? Like a popsicle . Gotta love this sphincter end of the universe . They 're just going to have a look . An examination . Make sure he puts the KY on the glove . What the hell are you doing here ? A meagre gesture of support , while the others attend to Aeryn and Jothee . Is there any permanent damage ? Just their pride . You seem remarkably lucid . Don 't get too close . I could turn any second . We 'll fix it , Crichton . Everyone 's pledged to give whatever it takes to ... I thought he couldn 't inhale our contaminants . You see the green light ? That 's a biological neutralizer , that is . You could have the Caritonga plague in here , wouldn 't touch him . Outside , pick your nose , and he 's dead . No ... pain . Re ... lax . Phoar , frelling critada ! You 're going to tell me my health plan doesn 't cover this , right ? Doctor doesn 't often say this . There 's nothin ' he can do . That thing in his head , he ... he can 't get it out without killing him . D 'Argo , the surgeon said it 's a numbing anesthetic , okay ? So ... so don 't breathe too much , all right ? And shake the canister every couple of ... - All right , already . I remember . What 's the matter with you ? - What 's the matter with you ? I ... I 'm just , I ... I 'm trying to have a relationship . And you think I 'm not ? Listen Chiana , you have to understand . It has been so long since I 've seen my son . - D 'Argo , I know how long it is . There is no one , no one who has lived this dream of finding your son more than me . You going to help , D 'Argo ? Couldn 't you wait a couple of microts , Stark ? I was talking to Chiana . Tocot says we got to put down another layer of Dowlandium ... Frell you . - after the first has been absorbed . Oh , you understand him . How many bodies did he say were in here ? I believe he said frelling millions . Aeryn , ah , did I ... say or do anything to piss you off ? I mean other than caving in the side of your head ? Are you serious ? Do you not remember ? Splendid news for the patient . I think I found a biological match . What ? You found a human ? Well , it 's called an Interion . It 's bipedal , central spine , organs internal . Oh , single heart circulation and small head . I 've got three specimens . That 's the best I can do . There are over 5,000 different species frozen here . This is an abomination against nature . It 's not as though they 're suffering , love , is it ? Yeah . I mean , they 're already dead anyway . No Aeryn , they 're still alive . That 's a technicality . No , I 'm not accepting anything from someone who 's alive . They 're all accident victims and the like . Hey , I mean we freeze them a microt before their death , 'cause the parts last longer that way . You have interrupted the course of nature . None of ' em would survive restoration . That is the Doc 's rules for accepting a donor . And you 've got three like me ? Well , similar . I mean it 's probably a species offshoot from the same stuff . Is that possible ? We 're somewhere near Earth ? I don 't know . I want this chip out . Splendid . 'Course , if it ah , don 't work , we get to keep your body . That 's it , D 'Argo . I can 't feel my tongue . Whose fault is that ? Oh , frell you . Ah ... naa ... tha ... aa ... You know what my dad wants to do with his share of the money ? Buy a farm . Really ? Mmm . He wants to grow prowsa fruit and make wine . I don 't want to live on a farm . I 've been a slave . Been chained to the mine . He wants to live the quiet life . I want to live loudly . Well I didn 't know that . I , um ... I guess it was going to be just you two . Oh , you , too , Chiana . Pilot , you 're high , okay ? I am no higher or lower than I 've ever been . My position is fixed . No , no , I mean the drug in Moya , it 's messing with your brain . He 's been using my DRDs to practice . Wanna see ? Secret . Chiana ... you know that I have to spend a lot more time with Jothee so I was hoping we could all find a quiet place and , uh ... settle down together . I was hoping you would consent to be my wife . Huh . What ? What a surprise to find you eating . So , Gunshock , how long will it be before the surgeon can operate on Crichton ? What , seven or eight arns . He wants to finish supervising the medication of your ship . He 's ah , splendidly conscientious . Well , we 'll just keep Crichton restrained until you 're ready . Yeah . - Good . Anything else ? What are you up to ? Higher level reasoning , Aeryn . If a simple thought occurs , I 'll call you . As I was saying , you must know your way around this backwater part of the galaxy . I know who I need to know . That 's a very small stone . Your savant surgeon says Moya won 't be able to Starburst for some time . I 'm , uh ... interested in securing other passage . There are some excellent choices available . It depends whether you require speed , stealth or strength . That 's another very small stone . All three . That 's not impossible . That 's ah , three very small stones . Oh . Splendid . Zhaan , what 's happening ? They 're treating one more tier , then the Diagnosan wants you . Great . Zhaan , listen . Yes , John . Odds are that I 'm not going to make it . Positive spirits . I pray to the goddess . Yes , but reality tells me ... Your soul is troubled . When the chip 's not controlling me , my thoughts are lucid . There are so many things that I want to say to my family and friends . If you could absorb these thoughts . We could find a way to get a message back to Earth . You want me to join with you in Unity ? I just want my dad to know . Concentrate on me . Hello , Delvian . Tenth Level Pa 'u ? Pity . A Twelfth could break this bond . Time to pray . Unlike your institutional upbringing , my parents were compassionate . Moral , emotional . I value those traits . They 're beginning to emerge in you . Crichton may not survive . Moya may be permanently crippled . The others are contemplating their next move . You 're an officer and a strategist . Have you not planned yours ? Sounds like you have a suggestion . This ship , this emotional ship , needs guidance . Talyn has chosen you . And I agree with his choice . There is much that you can learn that will surprise you . What ? How ? It 's Crichton . Relay us to Pilot . Crichton , why won 't you frelling answer ? Aeryn , don 't come after me , I 'm not in ... control . You will not shoot him down , Talyn . Crichton is broadcasting our location to Scorpius again . He must be stopped . Track me . Oh , and Crais ... Thank you . Yee-haw ! Shielded message for Scorpius . Coordinates on specified frequency . Request immediate extraction . Talyn , block and fragment his transmission as best as possible . Buy her some time . John Crichton to Scorpius . Limited flight capabilities due to the nature of this craft . Repeat , request immediate extraction . You just called yourself John Crichton . Are you really John anymore ? Ah , little lady . How 's the skull fracture ? Well , if I 'm not addressing Crichton then I address the neuro-chip in his head . At your service . You 're in an unarmed vessel . I believe Scorpius 's mandate is for Crichton to remain alive . And I intend to see that he does . You 've given no other choices . I will shoot you down . Oh , I doubt it . Make no mistake . I believe you 'll pull the trigger . I just don 't believe ... you 'll hit anything . Focus . Regain your place . Purge the memory . - No ... Crichton ... Stark , he is no more . His body shelters some horrific evil . Crichton ... Crichton 's gone . Now , this is flying ! How 's the ride back there , hmm ? A little bumpy ? Weapons locked to your exhaust . I give you one last chance to stand down . Ah , the radiant Miss Officious . So sure . So confident in the void of space . Crichton was trained to fly in atmosphere , against gravity . Welcome to our world , baby ! Aeryn , Crichton has often said he 'd rather die than fall to Scorpius . If you 've got the opportunity , don 't hesitate . What makes you think I would ? Because if our positions were reversed , I would . As Crichton might say ... Yee-ha ! Where the frell am I ? Lose your dance partner ? You don 't have enough fuel to last until Scorpius gets here . Depends on how close he is . Look , John , if you 're even in there anymore , look at what you 're doing . You fail to understand the extent of your friend 's misery . He wants Scorpius to find us . He wants to end his pain . No . I 'll never believe that . Look , Crichton , Scorpius , whatever you are , recognize , atmosphere included , I am the superior combat pilot . Darling , uncontested . So land your craft now or I shall be forced to demonstrate that skill . You really would shoot your friend down , wouldn 't you ? You know the answer . Well then , I shall comply . Lowering landing gear . Officer Sun , trust nothing . Oh , hush Crais . She doesn 't need you to tell her that . Descending now . Terribly sorry . Didn 't see you there . I am under attack ! I repeat , I am under attack ! Aeryn . Aeryn ! - Attempting to gain ejection altitude . I take it our encounter is terminated , Officer Sun . All options depleted . Requesting position track . Climb ! Eject ! - Requesting position track . Ejecting now ! Well done , Officer Sun ! Are you still conscious ? Frell you . Ooh . Fireworks . Aeryn . Aeryn ! It 's all right , D 'Argo . The descent brakes auto-ignited . I 'm all right . Officer Sun , in deference to that part of Crichton which still cares , I inform you that you descend not over solid ground , but a frozen lake . He 's right . D 'Argo , Crais , do you have my position ? Affirmative . - I 've got you , Aeryn . Can you avoid it ? Negative . I go down where this chair takes me down . Your jets will weaken the ice . I suggest separate before touchdown . I repeat , separate before touchdown ! Officer Sun ... Aeryn , can you comply ? Negative . The harness is jammed . Your frelling tire must have damaged the mechanism . Aeryn , listen to me . This is John . It 's John . Yeah , is it really you , John ? - Yes , listen to me . You do not want to be in that chair when you set down . Well , this harness won 't release . I don 't have anything to break it . Aeryn , you have to get out of the damn chair . I don 't have any choice . Come on , please . Do something . Do something . I don 't have any options . Baby , you 're not gonna die like this . You are not going to die like this . I hope you meant what you said in the neural cluster . I did . No ! Aeryn ! Crichton ! Cri ... Oh ... God . What have I done ? The goddess graciously receives to her bosom all those who pass from this existence regardless of faith or belief . She holds , however , a special place for those who travel this life as a journey . Aeryn Sun ... will surely harvest a favor . Her life was a series of strides toward enlightenment . Casting off the chains of prejudice and hatred ... reaching beyond violence and bigotry she sought a balance of lasting inner peace . In her name . You are more worthy of this . At peace , Aeryn . May the goddess receive you with charity . Amet . May the goddess sanctify your spirit . Ament . Ament . May the goddess purify your soul . May the goddess recite your name in the whispers of the wind . Amet . Amet . D 'Argo , give me your knife . Give me ... your knife . Aeryn , forgive me . I love you . I 'm ready . Are you sure you don 't want your friends here ? No , I don 't want ' em here . The Doc says , ' cause of that thing in your brain , there 's no way that you are responsible for what happened to that Sebacean . Yes , I am . Right . After the Doc 's cut the tendrils that have hijacked your brain , he 's going to try and take out the neuro-chip completely . But he needs your help . What do I got to do ? Because there is no template of your brain pattern on our database , he doesn 't what bits of gray do what . So , when he probes , you tell him . Right . Where will you be ? Anywhere else . I vomit when things get messy . Yes , Talyn . I , too would have liked to have shown Aeryn what we learned from this chip . I think ... I think it could have made her the happiest soul among us . Everyone else is preparing to move on . I know . Tragedy often heralds flight . What are you going to do , Zhaan ? My concern , now , is for Moya and Pilot . If you are in agreement , Pa 'u Zotoh Zhann , it would be honor and a pleasure to share the future with you . This is what ? Critters . More close encounters . And this ? American politics , Nixon to Clinton . Lose it . Here ? All of my dogs . Necessary ? No , but keep it if you can . The ship that you want , it 'll be on its way here shortly . Thank you . Service paid , service rendered , I guess . Too bad , eh ? Yes , but that 's life . Yeah . This ... section ? Keep this ? It 's too bad we don 't get to spend more time together . Yeah . My whole life , I never stayed in one place long enough to build any real relationships . And I always stayed too long . Jothee . Chiana . Let 's stay close . Once we find out about John we should discuss our future . Sure , Dad . Whoa ! Wormholes . That 's it . Good job from you . I should desist ? No frellin ' way . Here ! Down there ! What the frell was that ? ! Return to the Marauder . Inform Scorpius we have successfully maintained our zero presence profile . Now ! Very bad ... speech close to neural implant . You 're gonna take my memories and I 'm gonna talk gibberish ? Why not just take my mojo while you 're at it ? Remove chip ... then attempt replace ... you normal . What the hell . There 's no one I really want to talk to . Not much worth remembering . Take the damn thing out . I remove ... then restore you . Very clever , Greenschlick . Accomplished ... chip ... removal . Now ... replace ... brain . Hello , Doctor . So good to see you again . Oh , no , quite the contrary , really . Uh , my , uh , cooling apparatus is just as functional as the day you installed it . Eternal thanks . Oh , I am so sorry to disturb the , uh sterility of your theater , but , uh ... You no longer serve a purpose . What irony . Sensitivity to heal anything . But oneself . Well , Crichton , so much to say . And yet such little capacity . I only hope ... the wormhole technology I waited so patiently for makes more sense . Don 't need a translator microbe for that one , do we ? You 've cost me much . And I do not suffer disappointment well . I condemn you , John Crichton ... to live . So that your thirst for unfulfilled revenge will consume you . Goodbye .

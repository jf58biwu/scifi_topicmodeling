 Sector Station to Unit One . Unit One , please report . Unit One reporting . No traffic or unusual activity , Sector Station . Tell her my ass is freezing off and I need somebody here to get the blood circulating . Sector Station , Agent Daley here has a very special request . The mic 's off . - Don 't scare me like that , man . - C 'mon . Keeps you awake , don 't it ? - Something moving . - Where ? Heading right through the trees . Straight ahead . You see it ? Got it . Unit One to Sector Station . We are in pursuit of an illegal border crossing . The rabbit 's running for the hole . End of the road , buddy . Agent Scully . He 's expecting me . Go right in , Agent Scully . They 're all waiting for you . " They " ? - Sorry to keep you waiting . - Have a seat , please , Agent Scully . - May I ask what this is about ? - You can take a seat , please . Deputy Director Kersh has called you here today to ask you a few questions . All right ? Just a few ... routine questions . Do you know what this is ? Should I ? It 's a simple question , Agent Scully . Do you know what this is ? - I 'm not sure . - But you 've seen it before ? Am I under suspicion here ? Assistant Director Skinner led us to believe that you 'd be able to identify this evidence . - And why is that ? - You once worked on the X-Files . Then why don 't you ask somebody who 's working on the X-Files ? Because we 're asking you . Where did you get these ? They were found during an illegal border crossing in North Dakota . Canada to the US . - An illegal border crossing by whom ? - We 're asking the questions here today . What AD Follmer is saying is , your cooperation is important to this investigation , Agent Scully . I 'd like to cooperate . I 'd be happy to cooperate . I just wish that you would tell me who or what you are investigating . Were you called about this ? - Has AD Follmer been down here ? - Brad Follmer ? Yeah . Going through the X-Files . I doubt Agent Follmer even knows who we are down here , Agent Scully . Why ? What are you looking for ? These . - What are they ? - Rubbings . - Taken from the surface structure of a craft . - A craft ? A spacecraft , Agent Doggett , if you can wrap your brain around that . They were found by fishermen off the western coast of Africa . Two years ago , I traveled there to study it , and I took these . What has this to do with Follmer ? I was called into the deputy director 's office and shown an exact copy of that rubbing . I was asked by senior staff to identify it for them . - Where did they get them ? - A guy running the border from Canada . Or so they say . What did you tell them about these ? Nothing . And what aren 't you telling us ? That they 're powerful . We 're talking about pieces of paper with marks on . They 're not just marks , Agent Doggett . It 's writing . Words . Powerful words . And if the FBI has them , and they 're keeping their investigation of them a secret , then they have a sense of their power as well . Special Agent John Doggett , out of Washington . Looking for the agent in charge out here . Anybody point me to the ASAC ? Agent Doggett . Assistant Director . I don 't recall asking for your help or assistance on this case . The way it looks , I 'm the only agent outside DC you didn 't ask . What 's the big attraction ? Last night , a man made an illegal border crossing from Canada . A chase ensued . Ended here . Do you know anything about him ? About what he was doing ? We 're endeavouring to learn as much as we can , Agent Doggett . - Was he carrying anything interesting ? - Like what , for example ? I don 't know . Like , uh ... maybe something you 'd find in an X-File . If that 's what you came looking for , then you came a long way for nothing . - Then what 's with the cavalry ? - Excuse me ? A lot of good shoes out here looking for what 's gotta be a dead man . The guy was killed , right ? A man survives a fall like this , on fire ? It 's not very likely . You got a body ? We will , Agent Doggett . Like you say , I got the cavalry out here . You find that funny ? A dead man up and disappearing ? Happens every day , right ? At least it does on the X-Files . Trust me , Mr Doggett , this has nothing to do with you . Nothing to do with you , or the X-Files . Stick your nose in this case , and I promise you , you 'll live to regret it . Hi . Thanks for coming . I needed to talk to you about this in person . What is it ? What I 'm reading in your field report on these rubbings , Dana . There 's something I didn 't understand . You say these were taken off a spacecraft . You determined they were words , writings . You didn 't tell us you knew what they said . But you interpreted them as text from the Bible , from the Koran ... Scripture from religions around the world . And science , too . The periodic table of elements . Yes . And you wrote in your report they were millions of years old . Based on radiometric readings from fossils encrusted on the surface of the ship . Agent Scully , I know you 've become more open-minded about these things , but do you know what it is you 're saying here ? If it were true ... these symbols wouldn 't just be words . They 'd be the very word of God on the surface of an alien spacecraft . It 'd mean that everything mankind believes in ... is in question . And you believe this ? I didn 't . I mean , I refused to believe it . But now I think ... I think there may be answers there . Answers to what ? Answers about my son . I know how that sounds . I have no one else to say it to . That I was meant to find these . Somehow ... these were meant for me . Why would the FBI keep that from you ? From us ? And what exactly do they want with them ? Those are questions I can 't answer . Forget our extension ? Or you just can 't be bothered ? - Excuse me ? - Returning calls . Agent Reyes 's , mine . What the hell 's that about ? I 've been tied up , Agent Doggett . I just haven 't had a chance . That 's not what your phone log says . It says you 've returned everyone 's calls but ours . Agent Doggett , let me remind you who answers to whom here , I think you owe me an answer , sir . And if you don 't owe it to me , you owe it to Agent Scully , on this X-File case the FBI 's got . The one they 're keeping us from investigating . Are you ready for my answer , Agent Doggett ? It 's not an X-File case . That 's why you have 40 agents combing the border for a dead man that ain 't dead . - You don 't know what you 're talking about . - I was there . Without any authorization ! I don 't understand . None of us do . Why you 're keeping their secrets . Why you 're keeping quiet . Because I know things you don 't , John . And it 's for your own good . - Yeah ? Who 's there ? - It 's me . Open up , Monica . - Got it . - Got what ? What they 've been keeping a secret . What they won 't tell Scully . What they wouldn 't tell us . What am I looking at ? A file on the guy crossing the Canadian border last night . - Special Agent Robert Comer . - He 's FBI . I know this guy . I worked a case with him in New Orleans . Straight as a ruler . Last six months he 's been deep undercover . Undercover doing what ? We got a pile of reading to do - what 's not blacked out . Oh , and , uh ... I picked these up in a bargain . - AD Skinner gave you these ? - I sort of got it on loan . - We 'd better call Agent Scully . - I already did . Hey , you need a hand there , bro ? How about I just help you out , huh ? I 'm on my way . That was Agent Doggett again . They 're waiting . Mom , I gotta go . I just don 't understand why it can 't wait till tomorrow ? - It 's important . I wouldn 't go if it weren 't . - You say it 's about getting answers . Answers about William , Mom . I know you 're worried about him , but there are things you just can 't explain . - If you got answers , what would it change ? - Mom , he 's my child ! And you have to love him and raise him , in spite of everything . Dana , God has given you a miracle , a child that wasn 't supposed to be . Maybe it 's not to question , just to be taken as a matter of faith . Mom , I can 't take this on faith . I need to know . I need to know if it 's really God I have to thank . - Where 'd you get those ? - I got ' em . And the FBI 's file on the man who was carrying ' em . He 's one of ours , working deep undercover , infiltrating a religious group , some whacked out UFO cult . - A case they never told us about . - Where 's this cult supposed to be ? North Dakota . At some point they disappear into Canada . Agent goes along with them , FBI loses contact with him . What did they think he was doing running across the border with these rubbings ? The FBI thinks he went on to the dark side , became whacked out himself . And that 's the secret they 've been trying to keep . That 's it ? That 's the big secret ? That , and ... they can 't seem to find him , best I can figure . I was questioned this morning by the senior staff of the FBI , not about an FBI agent but about these rubbings . There 's gotta be something more . There may be , Agent Scully . But I 'm not sure even the FBI is aware of it . How could they be , without access to your files ? - What are you talking about ? - The set of rubbings the man smuggled doesn 't match the rubbings you took . Wait a second . How can that be ? It could only be that this whacked UFO cult found a second spacecraft . Mom ? He wants to kill the baby ! Don 't ! Please ! Don 't ! I 'll kill you ! I 'll kill you if you touch my baby ! Dana ! Oh , my God ! Mrs Scully , are you OK ? - What the hell happened here ? - I need your help , OK ? Agent Reyes , I need you to take my mom and the baby . Can you do that , Monica ? Of course . Who is that ? Is somebody here ? You gotta tell me what this is , who the hell this is , Dana . That man , that FBI agent , came here to kill my baby . - You gotta help this man . - No . Not until he tells me why . He won 't tell anybody anything unless you get him to a hospital . He 's losing blood fast . I am not gonna turn him over to the FBI . I am not gonna let them cover their tracks on this . Why ? Why do you want to hurt my son ? ! Agent Doggett , put down the phone ! He has to answer me ! - He has ... - What ? ! Say it ! - Your son ... - Say it ! - .. has to die . - Why ? ! Who told you that ? ! He 's my son ! I 've got a medical emergency , a man in critical " , This man have any kind of a weapon ? A pillow . Whatever brought him here , I hope to God we figure it out . What is it ? - This changes everything . - He can expose all this . He 's got proof he can show them . What do you wanna do ? There 's only one thing to do . Agent Scully , Agent Doggett . You can both have a seat . If this is just gonna be another interrogation , I 'd prefer to stand . Agent Scully , a man was shot in your apartment . An FBI agent . Trying to kill my son . That is not in question . There 'll be an investigation . Another secret investigation , or one where I 'm given warning that my family 's in danger ? It would help us to help you if you tell us anything this man communicated to you . I wouldn 't tell ' em anything until they explain why all the hush-hush over this case , why the doublespeak , the mincing words from Mr Follmer . Cos I want answers myself . The man you shot had been undercover , which you 've already found out through whatever unethical means . His assignment was to infiltrate a religious cult , one led by a former military officer , a very dangerous man by all accounts , and who also believed in very dangerous ideas ... about aliens . Why wasn 't I told ? Why not Agent Doggett , or Agent Reyes ? Why wasn 't this an X-File ? I asked them to put somebody else on the case because I was afraid it might break you . What are you talking about ? Agent Corner , our undercover man , was sent to infiltrate the cult ... based on a series of ... threats . What threats ? Threats to who ? To me ? My child ? Threats ... on Agent Mulder 's life . That 's what this is about ? Then why pull me in here and show me those rubbings ? I don 't understand . Before losing all contact with our undercover agent , he sent us a communication , a communication we 've been trying to confirm , that , uh ... that Mulder was already dead . - Here 's your mommy . - Hi , honey . Dana , what 's wrong ? What 's happened ? It 's OK . Just tell me what it is . It 's Mulder . What is it ? An artefact . I got it from the man who was trying to kill William . OK . But what the hell is it ? It 's a piece of the spacecraft . - Where 's Agent Scully ? - She 's still upstairs . I wanna talk to you before you see her , to explain what 's happened . You said it had something to do with the kid , that piece of metal . A piece of that ship in Canada . Come on , Monica . You 're just guessing there 's any such thing . It flew through the air at the baby . I saw it . - Just tell me the boy 's OK . - I don 't think you understand . The boy has some connection with this thing , this piece of metal . You saying this kid 's an alien ? You can believe or not , but the man who tried to kill Scully 's baby believed it . So must this cult , who are obviously more than willing to kill for their belief . - Where are we going ? - I 'll tell you on the way . - You drive . - What is it ? - I 'm right behind you guys . - What is it ? Probably nothing . Federal agent ! Stop the car ! - Who are we meeting ? - The only ones left we can trust . Hey , little man . Your baby 's in good hands . I need to know that you 're taking him to a safe place . I need to know that you 're ... that you 're taking every precaution . We understand . Langly ? There 's a chance that my phone lines have been tapped . - If so , they can trace you . - We thought about that . Six cellphones , their signals scrambled . Use each one once and then throw it away . Whatever you do , don 't worry . - What 's going on here ? - I don 't know . What happened ? Is it John ? Agent Scully . Scully . My baby . They 're after my baby . I have to get back . - What the hell is this ? - What the hell is what ? I made this !

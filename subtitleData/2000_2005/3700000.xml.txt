 THE TIME MACHINE Aren 't you Forgetting something ? I know . It 's something to do with The third differential coefficient . - Not that , Tonight , - What ? Emma ? - What time is it ? - Almost 5 : 00 , Oh , God . My proposal for utilizing Solar power , rejected , My concepts for harnessing Micro-energy waves , rejected , The dean suggests that I focus on Something that might actually help mankind , Like his study on the benefits Of tobacco consumption , Alex , the problem is Your ideas are a bit too ... radical , The problem is with The faculty . They 're dinosaurs . They 're already extinct ; they just don 't know it . They 'll be discovered by some future archaeologist , And he won 't know what to make of them . Their dim little eyes , Devoid of any curiosity - Alex , it 's your first year As associate professor . You might want to play things A little more conservatively . You sound just like my father .

I want my students prepared For the realities of the world They 're about to greet . Well , I don 't . I want them to run along This street and knock off every bowler they see . Mrs. Watch it ! Oh , huzzah , the master 's home . - Did you get it ? - Hello , Mr. Philby . Hello , Mrs. Watchit . You 're looking in the pink . Must be all the exercise I get scampering Up and down these stairs like a wee lad . - Don 't torture me . Did you get it ? - I got it . - Good . Let me see . - But don 't you think for one moment ... I 'm going to let you go out In that filthy jacket . Now , go in there and change . And you 've got another letter From that annoying little man . Well , go ahead , Switch it on , - It 'll help people keep Their teeth well into their 40s , - You might think about having that cleaned . - Oh , who has the time ? - How did you know with Molly ? - Know what ? You were meant to be together . - She made the best Shepherd 's pie I ever tasted . Don 't you have a single Romantic bone in your body ? No . I 'm all bowler hat . Why do you waste your time On that crack pot ? Because he has some Very interesting ideas . A professor at Columbia should not be Corresponding with a crazy German bookkeeper . He 's a patent clerk , Not a bookkeeper . I think Mr. Einstein deserves All the support I can give him . I wonder if we 'll ever Go too far ? - With what ? - With this . With all of this . No such thing . All right . How do I look ? Practically decent . Really , Alex . Good luck tonight . She 's a fine girl . She 's done Wonderful things for you . Don 't worry .

I hope you 're not coming down with something . Well , I 'm afraid I am . I 'm not sleeping very well , and even When I 'm awake , I 'm not much use . I can 't eat or think Or do much of any thing anymore . And the worst part is , I don 't know that I 'll ever be well . I think there 's only one remedy , And that 's for you to marry me ... - And spend the rest Of your life with me . Oh , Emma , I know it 's right . I know we 're meant to be together . It 's the only thing in my entire life I 've never had to think about . Oh , Alex . Uh-Uh , wait . I have something for you . You know , The moment is rather dying here . I - I know . Hold on .

Alex , will you please Stand still and look at me ! It wasn 't your fault . No . It wasn 't my fault . Maybe we should blame Mrs. Watchit for picking up the ring from the jeweler . Or the jeweler for making it . Or the poor bastard who tore The stone from the earth . Maybe I should blame you For introducing me to Emma In the first place . Yes .

Welcome to VOX system , How may I help you ? - It 's all right . - How may I serve you ? What can I get you ? Oh , let 's see . Um , Henry James . Oh , no . Yes ? No , no , no , Too depressing , Hemingway , Perhaps ? No , Too sweaty , Plato , Proust , Pinter , Poe , Pound ? No . Complete Works of Martha Stewart ? Ah , I have it ! Jules Verne . - Right up your alley , I would think , - Photonic , right ? Or what 's left of one , What 's left of all of them ? I am the last , and " these fragments I have shored against my ruins . " T.S. Eliot . You wouldn 't know him yet , But he is so depressing , yet so divine . Oh , I 'm sorry . The lending library is temporarily out of service . Not to worry . I have them all right here - every page of every volume . Can you tell me What 's happening here ? Well , my sources are No longer fully annotated , And my information is somewhat Anecdotal , but I believe What was once one race ... is now two . One above And one below . Two distinct species That have evolved . - And how do those below survive ? - That is the real question , isn 't it ? - I don 't believe it . - Well , If you don 't like the answers , You should avoid asking the questions . Look at them . They have no knowledge of the past , No ambition for the future , - So lucky . - Why would you say something like that ? Can you even imagine what it 's like to remember everything ? I remember a six-year-old girl Who asked me about dinosaurs 800,000 years ago . I remember the last book I recommended : Look Homeward , Angel , by Thomas Wolfe . And yes , I even remember you , Time travel : Practical application . How do you know about the Morlocks if you can 't leave this place ? There was one Eloi who managed to escape , He told me everything , We spent years together , Just talking . The conversation 's a little spotty now , But I do remember . - It 's good to have a friend . - Then you can help us find the Morlocks , Find Mara . And if the truth is so horrible , And will haunt your dreams for all time ? Well , I think I 'm used to that . My friend said he came from the east , From the jungle . - will you describe it ? - I don 't have to . Just follow the breathing . In the dream , we 're moving toward it , But I think it was meant to keep us away , - I might just go in by myself . - No . Mara would be very cross with me if you got hurt . Now , I 'll find her , But I need you to go back To the village and light a fire So we can find our way home . - All right ? Will you do that for me ? - I lost your pocket watch . They took it from my room . I 'm sorry . Why would they take it ? Oh . Stupid . Mara ? Mara ? Mara . Mara ? Come a little closer . I don 't bite . Do I surprise you ? - A little . Yes . - Hmm . We weren 't always like this . After the moon fell from the sky , The Earth could no longer Sustain the species . Some managed to stay above , The rest of us Escaped underground , Then centuries later , When we tried to reemerge Into the sun again , we couldn 't , So we bred ourselves Into castes . Some to be our eyes and ears . - Some to be our muscles and sinews . - You mean you 're hunters . Yes . Bred to be predators , But bred also to be controlled . You see , My caste concentrated ... On expanding Our cerebral abilities . - You control their thoughts . - Not just theirs . The Eloi . So it 's not enough that you hunt Them down like animals . - That 's their role here . - To be your food ? Yes . And for those who are suitable , To be breeding vessels ... For our other colonies . You see , I 'm just one of many , I don 't understand how you can sit there And speak so coldly about this . Have you not considered the human Cost of - of what it is you 're doing ? We all pay a price ... Alexander . Don 't worry . You 're safe . I control them . Without that control , They would Exhaust the food supply ... in a matter of months . Food supply ? They 're human beings ! Who are you ... To question 800,000 years ... Of evolution ? - This is - This is a perversion Of every natural law . And what is time travel But your pathetic attempt to Control the world around you , - your futile effort to have A question answered ? Do you think I don 't know you , Alexander ? I can look Inside your memories , Your nightmares , Your dreams . You 're a man haunted by Those two most terrible words : What if ? Look at you ! - And along ponytail - - Daddy ! - Who 's that ? Is it Daddy ? - Daddy ! - Long ponytail , And we 're still having lots of fun , Right , Right . Da-da ! Daddy . You built your time machine Because of Emma 's death . If she had lived , It would never have existed . So how could you use your machine To go back to save her ? You are The inescapable result ... Of your tragedy , Just as I ... Am the inescapable result ... Of you . You have your answer . Now go . I believe you have something That belongs to me . - We all have our time machines , Don 't we ? Those that take us back Are memories ... And those that Carry us forward ... Are dreams . - You 're forgetting one thing . - Huh ? What if ? - What are you doing with it ? - Changing the future . Come on . Wait . Wait here . Go . Hurry ! Huh ? Alexander ! I 'm sorry You lost your machine . Oh , it 's all right . It was only a machine . " The congregation rose and stared ... " While the three dead boys Came marching up the aisle : " Tom in their lead , Joe next , " And Huck , A ruin of drooping rags , " sneaking sheepishly in the rear . " They had hid in an unused gallery , Listening to their own funeral sermon . Aunt Poly , Mary and the Harpers Threw themselves upon them - " This is the place . So it is . - But there 's nothing here . - Well , it was different then . My laboratory was all around here . The kitchen was up there Where that tree is . Not that Mrs. Watchit Ever let me go in there . I don 't know What to tell you , sir . He 's been gone This whole week . And you 've no idea Where he went ? - No , sir . - This would be my green house , There was a garden outside . Gren ' tormar 'tas ? Yes . - I 'm glad . - Sir ? I 'm glad he 's gone . Maybe he 's finally found someplace Where he can be happy . - This was my home . - His home . Long ago . You know , Molly and I were talking About engaging a housekeeper , Someone to live with us And help take care of Jamie . Would you be interested ? - Perhaps just until the master returns . - Of course . - But there 'd be some changes made . I run a tight house . Oh , I have no doubt of that . I 'll call By in the morning , and we 'll arrange it . - Good night , Mrs. Watchit . - Good night , Mr. Philby . Godspeed , my fine lad . Godspeed .

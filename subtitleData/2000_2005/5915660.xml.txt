 Oh , yeah ... Work , frell you , work ! Ah ! Oh ... See to me , it 's unbelievable , you know . I can come to the Mall of the Uncharted Territories , buy anything I want , 'cause I 'm rich , and that leather , SM faced wacko Scorpy clone , he 's ... he 's locked in here , so you know ... anything , with all , you know ... everything is gonna be just fine , but no , my friend she 's sick , so we gotta find a place where she can heal and you have no idea what I 'm talking about , do you ? No . What the hell 's going on out there ? Gamma disturbances are quite common in this area . What , are you talking like storms ? Well , yes . They 're no problem . John ! Hey , yo , Heavy D ! Hey , have you tried one of these things ? They 're terrible , but once you get past the blue slime , underneath , pure aviation fuel . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Look what I got for me and Chiana . They 're union tattoos . Oh . They are burned into our skin . - Cool . You know , I ... I never thought I was gonna get married again . But then ... What ? Have you been talking to Chiana ? No , no . No , she 's angry with me , but once she get these ... Yeah , D 'Argo , look ... I could be wrong , all right ? Um , probably am . She probably wouldn 't , but ... Chiana could say no . How could she say no ? No ! No ... No more . This is crazy . Yeah . And creepy . Why are we in here with these bodies ? Because it 's cold . Your Dad , D 'Argo ... D 'Argo hates the cold . So he won 't catch us if he comes back early . I 'm half-Luxan . I 'm not crazy about the cold , either . I 'll warm you . Take those to our vessel . - Yes , your Eminence . - Thank you . Your Eminence just gave them a 300 fenik tip . That 's more than a year 's wage . The servant class is never rewarded enough . Here . Let me help you . I 'm dying , Stark . I 'm not an invalid . Don 't talk like that . I 've got maps here . Maps . We 'll find a planet where you can recuperate . Just buy me an intoxicant . That 's all I need to recuperate . She looks weaker . Yes , she does . So , what did you buy ? Just some essentials . What would that be ? Floss ? Lip liner ? Weapons . I traded a pulse pistol for some original Taric deployers . Cool . Are you Crichton ? Who are you ? Security . And are you Crichton ? No , he 's not . And we don 't know who this " Cretin " is . You know , I heard he destroyed a Peacekeeper Gammak base , murdered an entire Nebari battalion , even laid waste to a Shadow Depository . The guy was a devil . He raped and pillaged , he popped eyeballs . Whoa , whoa , where ... where do they get these stories ? Let 's set the facts straight . First off , there was no raping , very little pillaging and Frau Bl cher popped all the eyeballs . I knew you were Crichton . Look , I 'm not here for any trouble . I 'm just looking for some aviation fuel shooters . That 's great . That 's great because , in here , everything 's on me . We hate Peacekeepers . Hey , Moordy ! Moordy ! Intoxicants for Crichton and his ... his grunt . I 'm not his grunt . Yeah , so ... you here to kill somebody ? Can I help you ? No , no , no , my grunt does all my killing . I 'm strictly RR . What the hell 's going on around here ? Moordil , what 's the problem ? Watch out ! Down , Zhaan ! My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut . I got shot through a wormhole ... In some distant part of the universe ... I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship ... This living ship ... Of escaped prisoners . My friends . If you can hear me ... Beware . If I make it back ... Will they follow ? If I open the door ... Are you ready ? Earth is unprepared ... Helpless , for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay ... Protect my home ... Not show them ... You exist ... But then you will never know the wonders I 've seen . Aeryn ! Where 's Aeryn ? Aeryn ? ! Here . Under a pile of dren ! Are you okay ? - Yeah , yeah , yeah . Nothin ' like a bomb to sober you up . I 'm fine . Anybody hurt ? - Stark ! I 'm bleeding ! Help me ! I 'm bleeding ! - I 'm here . I 'm coming . Hey , what happened here ? Was it a bomb ? The storm ! I thought you said the storms were no problem ! Pilot , how 's Moya ? We 've been thrown into the docking rings . Moya 's elastic skin saved us , but three hatches have ruptured . Chiana , can you hear me ? I , uh , got you , Pilot . There 's a hatch breach on tier seven . I 'm onto it . Is Jothee all right ? Oh , yeah . He 's fine . I 'd better get up to Moya and see if there are any survivors . Check on her exterior . Chiana ! This guy ... this guy 's moving ! What ? What 'd you do to him ? I didn 't do anything . The thing busted open , he started moving . Well ... well , close it up ! Just ... I don 't think you can just " close it up . " What the hell 's he waking up for ? I thought he was dead . No , no , no . They were quick-frozen or something before they died . Stay with him . I don 't want to stay here . - Just make sure he 's okay , all right ? Crichton wants to talk to him . He thinks he 's ... he thinks , uh , some kind of relative . Chiana ! What if he heard us when we were ... Jothee ! I gotta stabilize the frelling hatch ! Whoa ! Watch where you 're going ! Watch yourself , slut . What did you say ? - Out of my way . Zhaan needs these medical supplies on the station . What 's the matter with you , Ryg ? I heard you . You heard nothing . Freezer chamber . Young half-breed . Any of this getting you wet ? If you tell D 'Argo , I will rip out your tongue and shove it up your fekik ! You idiot , I won 't have to tell him . He 's Luxan . He 'll smell Jothee all over you . Keep your lips shut . Hmm ... You do the same with your legs . I 'm in the Transport Pod , Pilot . Three of the station 's five pods have been destroyed . I can 't find any signs of survivors . How 's Moya ? Well , her epidermis seems intact but she 's tangled up in some of the station 's cables . I 'll see if I can reverse us clear . Look , Pilot , wait . There 's another ship close by . It seems intact . Try to bring it in using the docking web . I 'll try , D 'Argo . Don 't move , Moordil . The beam has pierced your mynan artery . What does it matter ? The station 's destroyed . There must be hundreds dead . Hundreds ! Shhh , stay calm , Moordil . There 's nothing we can do about those souls , anyway . Everything 's gone . Then those stories must be true . What are you talking about ? You see , there were once three Commerce Stations near the twin suns of Qell . But one has been destroyed by asteroids , one has been burned by fire , and we are the last remaining station . There were stories that we were cursed . Why would you be cursed ? Because this station is built on what we call the Sacred Stillness . This is where some say the great Gods were born . That 's just dren ! There 's no curse . It was ... it was just storms . No , they weakened before they reached us . But you know this last cycle , it 's been gaining in strength . The storms have been compacting to funnels just six parisims wide . Each storm getting closer . It 's as if they were aimed at us . You can 't aim a storm . Then the curse must be true . This is Gezma 's revenge for buying and selling in his Sacred Stillness . Where am I ? On a Leviathan . We found you in a medical lab . You don 't remember how you got here ? No ... I just ... I was on an expedition . We were looking for the Dimordis Tomb in the Berger Nebula . I got sick . Stanis and me got sick . Jool found us . When you were in there , before you woke up , you hear anything ? I sensed ... some movement . Kind of a thumping sound . It didn 't last long . Are you okay ? I 'm supposed to look after you so don 't do anything crazy . Oh , frell ! Chiana , get down here ! I think this guy 's dying ! Get down here . Handle it yourself ! See if you can force it , Chiana ! Pilot ? I 've sealed the vent . Pilot ? We 've got another problem . The child ... uh ... the child your friend saw must be trapped in the lower pod . There is ... there is ... there was a nursery there for when the parents were shopping . How do I get down there ? - You can 't . All the connecting walkways are crushed . No , no , no , no . There 's always another way in . If those filtration vents have integrity , they link to waste conduits in the lower pod . Over here ? Yes , that 's it . All right , I 'll check them out . All right , I 'm coming with you . What did you do to him ? Nothing . He puked on me , then he died . You killed him , didn 't you ? - What ? ! What , did he see us ? Is that why you killed him ? No , he didn 't see us . I didn 't ki ... Even if he did , I wouldn 't kill him ! He just died . - Chiana . - Yeah , D 'Argo . You and Jothee get down to the transport hangar and make sure that ship we 're bringing on board isn 't hostile . We 're on our way . Go bathe . What ? We 're in the middle of this massive khamsin and you want me to wash ? What do you smell , Jothee ? Right now ? You smell me , don 't you ? And you 're only half Luxan . D 'Argo will smell me all over you unless you go bathe before he gets back on board . Go . Go now . All right Moordil , short incline and then it splits off . If it 's still intact the lower vent should lead to the nursery . Got it . After me . After you . You know , I 've been thinking . About us . You want to talk about this now ? Oh , it 's a good time . No one here to bother us . I know the pressures of living close . How it can effect the safety ... of an entire battalion ... unless tensions are relieved . So what do you suggest ? Well , in Peacekeepers it was common practice to , uh ... reduce fluid levels . Fluid levels ? Like ... well , like Valvoline ? Like brake fluid ? Like sex . We can have sex if you want . You know what ? Uh ... now is not a good time . How about I , uh , check my diary and get back to you later in the week ? It would relieve the tension . Is this for you or for me ? For both of us . You know what ? I got ... two hands . I can alternate . I can release all the tension I want . I don 't need your charity . And I don 't need your emotions . But we can have sex if you want . Watch that . That 's broken . Yeah . But don 't change the subject . What are you afraid of , John ? Aeryn ! Aeryn ! Aeryn ! Aeryn ! John ! You okay ? Yeah , I 'm okay . Something smells completely frelnik down here , so I suspect I 've found the waste conduit Moordil said we had to find . Look , just stay where you are . I 'll go get some help and we 'll get you out . No , I 'm going to follow this down . See if it leads to the lower pod . No , stay where you are . Tell Moordil I 'll Comm him when I need directions . Damn it , you stubborn ... Crichton . Pilot , I 'll call you back . I can 't talk right now . You have to talk . I 've run the residual storm graph you wanted . You were right . The storm took a 90-degree turn to hit us . 90 degrees ? It seems to have come after us on purpose . And there 's worse . Pilot says there 's another storm on the way . It 's gonna hit us in less than two arns and it 's bigger than the last one . Hit us ? This station can 't take another hit . - Yeah , I know that . Then let 's all get onto Moya and haul out of here . I can 't pull the spike out of Moordil and I can 't just leave him here . Well , he 's going to die , isn 't he ? - Well , yes , but ... What does it matter if we leave him ? - Blue ... Blue , Sparky , just knock it off . We 've got at least two arns . Aeryn can use that time to try free the trapped girl . I don 't give a sisil 's arse about a trapped girl . Yes , and that 's what makes you a great humanitarian , Buckwheat , but we are not leaving . Scooby Doo time . All right , here 's the deal . Our pilot says that the storms are being attracted by a flux broadcast being generated somewhere inside this station . The station ? - From in here ? Yes . Someone 's targeting the storm at us ? Yes . You see ? I told you the storms weren 't Gezma 's wrath . No . You just managed to piss somebody off . Now , do you have any idea who would wanna destroy your station ? Tell him . Frell . Go on , tell him . I 'm probably going to die anyway . There 's a cult of religious zealots , the Kampeks . Some call them noble warriors . - But they 're not . - They 're insane . And you can 't bribe them . I tried when I thought they were responsible for the destruction of the other stations . Kampeks ? This is their Sacred Stillness ? You see , they say we 're desecrating their gods by buying and selling here . They must be broadcasting the storm signals . Then let 's destroy it . Let 's find out where the signals are coming from and smash it . How ? There are 12 levels on this station . You 'll never search it in two arns . We might . I 've got an idea . Pilot says it 's empty but he can 't sense how to get inside . The defense shield is active all the way around the ship . - Give me a shot . - I 'll get inside . What 's that smell ? I bathed . I did . Twice . Are you wearing perfumed wash ? Yeah , I gave him some from Zhaan 's chamber . Yeah , well , uh ... you smell very nice . - Give me a break . No , no , really , you do . You smell just ... Shut up . You can find you own way into the frelling ship . Jothee ! I was only teasing . Jothee ! Um , you look attractive . Do I ? Yes , like you 're happy . I 'm not . I know I 've been a trasnik and I want to apologize . Look , don 't worry about it , okay ? No , really . I am so sorry . And there 's , uh , something I 'd like to talk to you about if ... Uh , look , D 'Argo , I 'm not , I 'm not ready to talk now , okay ? What do you want me to do , beg ? I said I 'm sorry . No , I don 't want you to beg . I just ... I 'm not ready to talk . Just because you 're ready to talk , it doesn 't mean that I am . Okay . I 'm sorry , I ... Uh , Pilot 's ... Pilot 's got two more hatches for me to check and I just wanted to do that first , okay ? Fine . Fine . Okay . That 's just about the last of the DRDs . If Crichton 's correct , they should give us some indication of where the signal 's coming from . What 's the matter ? Oh , nothing . Have you got One-Eye working yet ? Not yet . I think it 's the energy exchanger , but that can wait . Don 't worry about me , Stark . It 's all right . Let me look at your head . - No , just stop ... I said let me look at it ! Let me look at it now ! The sores are worse . The weakening is progressing . - Stark , don 't . Much faster . Much faster than we predicted , much . But , I ... I will find you a planet . A planet with the right soil and moisture . Calm yourself , Stark . Please . You 're the expert here . You 've witnessed more death than anyone else . So many dissatisfied souls dying before they felt ready . Yes , I 'm an expert on dying . I 'm just not an expert on you dying . All right , Moordil . Looks like some kind of binary code followed by four circles . Ah , you 've reached the lower pod . Keep going for another 300 metras . Got it . Help ! Hello ? - Is anyone there ? Hello ? Do you think he knows ? How could he know ? He looked at me like he knew . What are you gonna tell him ? I 'm not gonna tell him anything . Tell who ? Crichton . We don 't know what to tell him about the guy cacking . I 'm sure he 'll understand it wasn 't your fault . I thought Pilot wanted you to reseal the hatch . I was on my way down to help you . Well , he did . He does . We 're , we 're going now . What 's that smell ? I told you . It 's just the scented wash . You know , the perfume wash . No , no , no , no , no . There 's something else . Well I don 't smell anything . Why are you both in here ? I told you . We were just checking on the dead guy . I don 't believe you . Did you talk to Rygel ? About what ? You have betrayed me . D 'Argo ... - With my own manin . I 'm not your manin . - Obviously . I didn 't mean that . I ... - Well what did you mean ? D 'Argo , let 's not ... - Let 's not what ? Get angry ? Or ... kill you ? Do you know what this is ? D 'Argo , this is my fault . Mine , not Jothee 's . Get away from me now . It 's a union tattoo . It 's a Luxan symbol of courage , honor , and loyalty . I was going to give it to Chiana , but I was wrong . I want you to have it . D 'Argo , I don 't want to have to ... - No , I insist ! D 'Argo , let him go ! - Get away from me ! D 'Argo ! But you ... you will never get these . D 'Argo , listen to me . - No ! I will never listen to anything either of you have to say again . D 'Argo . D 'Argo . D 'Argo ! I know what it was I smelled before . It was a burnt-out function cell in the cryo chamber . There . Got it . What is it ? I don 't know . What you got ? The signal 's coming from here . From here ? Crichton , Borlik , back off . But I 'm ... I 'm not sending out any frelling signal . See , I told you . What ? Well why is it making this noise ? Why is it making that noise ? Obviously , you haven 't fixed it properly . You sure One-Eye 's working right ? It 's working . No , it 's broken . Give him the Scooby Doo snack , then . Where 's the signal coming from ? Lak-ma-ruka-be ... Lak-ma-ruka-be . Lak-ma-ruka-be . Lak-ma-ruka-be . Lak-ma-ruka-be . Lak-ma-ruka-be . Lak-ma-ruka-be . Lak-ma-ruka-be . Lak-ma-ruka-be . Lak-ma-ruka-be . Dude , she 's stuck , man . She 's still broadcasting . Yeah , but where 's the signal coming from ? I think it 's coming from inside her . Lak-ma-ruka-be ... - Inside her ? ! Is that why she 's stuck to the wall ? I don 't know . She 's somehow magnetized herself to the pipe . Okay . Enough . Let 's kill her cut her off the frelling pipe and chuck her out . No , no , no , no . That pipe is hydro-honium steel . Frozen exhaust . If you rupture it , we 'll freeze in 10 microts . Worm , are you ready to die in the cleansing apocalypse ? Lak-ma-ruka-be ... - Worm ? ! Are you ready to die in a cleansing ramming ? Rygel , cut it out . I 'm going to kill the bitch now ! Rygel , we don 't know what 's going on . We don 't know anything so we don 't know if killing her will stop the damn signal . Who cares ? It 'll shut her up and make me feel good . Lak-ma-ruka-be . Lak-ma-ruka-be . Buckwheat ! Stop it . Go on , kill me . Shoot me . Cut me into pieces and burn my flesh with selik acid but my broadcast will still be sent . The apocalypse will cleanse you all . At least let me shut her up . Lak-ma-ruka-be ... Shove it in deep , Rygel . Pilot , how long before that storm hits ? It seems to be increasing in velocity . Probably less than an arn . But I was thinking . Since the pipe Borlik 's magnetized to is made of hydro-honium steel , perhaps if we found a larger source of it ... It would pull her away from the pipe . Good . We have any of that hydro-crap on board ? Running an inventory check now . Aeryn , you might have to forget about the kid . I think I heard something . Make it quick . You 've got less than an arn . Are you still there ? Yes , I 'm here . I just need to know where you are . Keep making noise . Help ! Hurry ! Yeah , hang on , I 'm coming . I 'll follow your voice . Please ! I 've located three sources of hydro-steel . Two are in the neural cluster cooling rods . Can we get to it ? - Not in time . But the third source is accessible . The cryo-chambers you brought aboard are lined with hydro-steel . The attraction from one of them could pull Borlik loose . Good . So we drag her onboard Moya , fly as far away from the station as we can , divert the storm . But we 're still trapped by the docking cables . I 've tried to pull us clear , but I can 't . All right , well , find D 'Argo . Tell him I need his help on this . I 've been signaling his Comms , but he 's not answering . Why not ? I think I might know why . Hey , D. How you doing ? You know , don 't you ? Yeah . Did you know when I showed you the union tattoos ? No , I didn 't . They 're bragging about it , aren 't they ? D 'Argo , it 's not like that . Rygel found out , and he told me what ... We don 't have time for this . Yes , I know . I heard you talking to Pilot . You want me to go outside and help free Moya . While I go grab Borlik . Well , why don 't you get Chiana and Jothee to do it . They like working together . D 'Argo , they can 't free the cable . They 're not as strong as you are . They 're not as brave , they 're not as smart . Oh , look , don 't ! All right , just don 't ! They broke my heart , John . I know that . But if you don 't go out on Moya and pull that cable off , we 're all going to die when that storm hits . Then we all die . I can 't hear you anymore . Hello ? Are you still there ? Can you hear me ? Hello ? Frell . Hello ? What the hell were you thinking ? Obviously , we weren 't thinking . - Obviously . We didn 't think we 'd get caught . - Do you know what you did ? You betrayed the one person on this ship who would have done anything for you . Both of you . He would have died for you . Yeah , we need you , D 'Argo . We need you . Oh , and by the way , would you mind putting your hands against the wall and spreading your legs so I can kick you up the mivonks ? 'Cause you have got to be one dumb trasnik . I 'm starting depressurization . I 've created an inertial field on Moya 's skin so you can move around some . But be careful . The winds are reaching speeds of 300 nilits . I 've got a breathing regulator in case I have to stay out there . Crichton told me you weren 't going out . Well , you know what ? I changed my mind . Why ? Good-bye , Pilot . D 'Argo ? D 'Argo ? I 'm outside , Pilot . Where are the cables ? Just looking now , D 'Argo . Hamman side . Got it . Take the gag out . Lak-ma-ruka-be . Lak-ma-ruka-be . You want to hear this ? See , I see your fear , worm . But the Holy Gezma will embrace even you , if you repent . Repent ? We have less than an arn . I was a Dominar . It 'd take me longer than that to repent . When about to die you should feel more shame . Hey , fridge magnet . I got something for you to feel . What is that ? Oh , what 's the matter ? Is that your fear I see ? You 're not so psycho happy now . Oh , what are you doing ? This is hydro-steel . Just like that pipe . Only this is bigger . So it may be your turn to repent for all the souls you 've murdered . Don 't ! Keep it away ! Lak-ma-ruka-be . Lak-ma-ruka-be . Lak-ma-ruka-be . Lak-ma-ruka-be . Lak-ma-ruka-be ... Gezma will destroy you . Got her , Pilot . We 're coming back to Moya . We 'll try to free her up . Crichton , don 't you know ? D 'Argo 's already outside . Pilot , I 've cleared Moya of all the cables except for two . Be careful . Those last cables are pulse rechargers . Can you shut them down ? I have no control over them . They are linked to the station 's power source . But I can 't move them unless they 're neutralized . Crichton 's on his way . He can help you . No . I can do this alone . - D 'Argo ? Listen to me . - Wait for Crichton . He 'll ... No , Chiana . You can never tell me what to do , ever again . Crichton , talk to D 'Argo . Talk to him now . D 'Argo ? D 'Argo , what are you doing out there ? What you asked me to . When I neutralize these cables you 'll be able to pull Moya clear . Wait ! Wait for me . Good-bye , John . No ! Don 't do it ! No ! Pilot , why the hell did you let him go out ? He didn 't ask for my permission . You could 've stopped him ! I would shut up and stop wasting time , Commander ! You 're telling the wrong person to shut up . We have less than a quarter of an arn before the storm funnel reaches us . Any signal yet , Pilot ? Nothing . Crichton , if you 're unable to save D 'Argo , Moya is willing to try and rip free from the cables , but ... No , no , no ! I 'll get us clear . Is he dead ? Is my father dead ? - I don 't know . I 'll go with you . I 'm half-Luxan . I can survive out there . I 'll help ... You don 't know that , Jothee , and I can 't be rescuing two people . Now get out of here . Get out of here ! You 're slowing me down ! Crichton , no ! Crichton ... Do you see him ? Not yet , Pilot . D 'Argo ! Pilot , he 's not responding . I 'm going to fix the ship first , then go after him . Get to him ! Get to him now ! Heading for the cable . I 'm coming out there myself ! No , Chiana , stay the hell where you are ! Frell ! Help me ! Hang on , I 'm almost there ! Help me ! Please ! Hurry ! Save them . I should have known Borlik was one of them . A Kampek . Pilot , I can 't ... Crichton ! I 'm at the access hatch ! Moordil , what 's the code ? Moordil ! What 's the frelling code ? Oh , Gezmana ... I can 't hear you ! Moordil ! By the Goddess . What 's the frelling code ? Aeryn , he 's dead . Moordil 's dead . Get back now . We 've got to get out now ! No way . Not yet . I just hope this works . Frell me dead . Have you reached him ? Not yet . I 'll get to him soon . Get to him now . Chiana , I 'm busy . If I don 't ... John , I 've got you . D 'Argo ! Let 's get the cable . You all right ? All right , on my count . One ... two ... three ! That 's it , Pilot . Moya 's free . We 're coming in . Hurry ! We must draw the storm away from the station now ! D 'Argo ... Aw , man , what are you doing ? Hell . I 'm not going in without you , D 'Argo . Keep moving ! That way . Zhaan , what 's going on ? We 're getting the dren knocked out of us down here ! Aeryn , hurry ! You must get back here . Moya 's freed but the storm may still hit us . Well , if it does I don 't think we 're going to make it . Hurry ! Come on ! Move it ! Is he alive ? He 's alive . Look after him . D 'Argo ... Crichton , where is he ? He 's with Chiana . Pilot , are we moving ? Attempting Starburst . No ! In Starburst , the storm won 't be able to track Borlik 's signal . Accelerating now . I thought you were going to die out there . Hey , come here . I want ... you both ... to stay away from me ! Don 't ! Commuter forecast on your travel day . Storms expected , just for you ... I think I 'll be able to share my purification . It took all my strength , but I was able to reconfigure the magnetics and stick here . By the time you cut me down the storm will be upon us . Lak-ma-ruka-be . You 're too smart . Where are you going ? Uh , you win , we lose . You ... you outsmarted us . But that door you 're stuck to ... It 's detachable . No ! Yes . - No , you lie ! No , you will still be purified . The Holy Gezma 's punishment will be brought down upon ... Blah-blah , blah-blah , blah . Pilot ! - Lak-ma-ruka-be ! I 'm clear . Detach the door . and suck this bitch out ! Lak-ma-ruka-be ! There you go . That 's it . Watch your head . Good . Thank the Goddess , the children are safe . Now we must find a planet where you can regain your strength . If She so wishes it . Been thinking about that thing we talked about . About charity , and , uh , maybe ... Maybe you were right . We should do nothing . What about body fluids ? There 'll be a backlog . Fluid levels ? Backlog ? Is there some kind of problem ? Shut up . Hmm ? What did I say ? Shut up . - Shut up . You 're really gonna ... you 're gonna leave without saying anything ? Yeah . D 'Argo 's right . I know nothing of Luxan honor or integrity . I 'm a half-Luxan . I betrayed him . And if I stay , I 'll ... I 'll probably do it again . It wasn 't all your fault . Yeah , I never figured that bit . Why 'd you do it ? I don 't know . D 'Argo had plans for ... for me . For a stupid farm . I didn 't want any of them . I knew he wouldn 't take no for an answer , so I just ... I figured I had to do something he 'd never forgive . You used me ? Yeah , a little . But you enjoyed it , didn 't you ? Tell my father , if he 'll let you , that I 'm sorry . And that one day I 'll return and make it up to you both . I 'll tell him .

 02 Cube 2 Hypercube - Horror Mystery 2002 720p [ H264-mp4 ] English Hello ? Anyone here ? Hello ? Aah ! [ Gasps ] Numbers . Where 's the god ... Goddamned numbers ? Oh , god . There 's got to be something in ... Oh , shit ! Aah ! Goddamn it ! Aah ! Goddamn it ! I mean , they 're my numbers . Don 't I at least get a shot with my numbers , you stupid fucks ? ! I want a chance ! Uh ... I want a chance like everyone else . [ Distant screaming ] Oh , my god . Oh , you bastards . Oh , shit . Our father , which art in heaven , hallowed be thy name ... Thy kingdom come , thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven . Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors , and lead us not into temptation ... Lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil , for thine is the kingdom ... And the power and the glory ... Forever and ever . Amen . Hello ? Are you all right ? Can you hear me ? Are you hurt ? Aah ! Aah ! Don 't move . Don 't make a sound . Mmm ! I said don 't move . Are you alone ? Blink once for yes , twice for no . Is there anyone else in the other room ? All right , I 'm going to release you ... But I can take you down again just as quick as the first time , so don 't scream . Do you understand ? Once for yes , twice for no . Are you alone ? All right . All right . What the hell do you think you 're doing ? How many rooms you been in ? What is this place ? I don 't know ! You tell me ! How many rooms you been in ? I don 't know . 5 or 6 . What about you ? Uh , this is my third . You sure you didn 't see anyone else ? No . Have you ? No . So , who are you ? Who are you ? [ Distorted voices ] What the fuck are those noises ? ! Relax . This is just for show , all right ? Pretend that you 're scared . That should be easy . All right , get down here now , or she 's dead . Some hero . I have that effect on men . Glad to see you haven 't lost your sense of humor . [ Door opens ] Is this really necessary ? Just hang on . Isn 't that the same ... [ Door opens ] Hey ! Hey ! Come back ! [ Door opens ] Man : Jesus Christ ! Hey ! What ? ! Where the fuck do you think you 're going ? This guy sure moves quickly . He 's just ... Gone . Yeah . Well , maybe something made him gone . Maybe you should come back . This place is awful . Girl : Please don 't hurt me . Don 't be frightened . Don 't worry . There 's nobody else here . It 's just me . I 'm Kate . What 's your name ? Sasha . Well , that 's a beautiful name . Don 't worry . Everything 's gonna be all right , OK ? Do you understand me ? I 'm just blind ... Not retarded . [ Door opens ] [ Man struggling ] Uh ! Well ... Finally . I was beginning to wonder if I was the only one in here . I kept hoping that I would find some other people . I 've been wandering around these rooms for hours . Sasha : Stay away from me ! No one 's going to hurt you . Well , certainly not . No , no . I come in peace , young lady . I 'm Jerry . This is Sasha . She 's blind , and she 's very scared . Oh . Bummer ... To be blind in this place . You know what this place is ? No . And I don 't suppose either of you two could let me know what we 're doing in here ? No . Oh , uh ... Jerry Whitehall . Kate Filmore . Kate : What are you doing ? I 'm marking the rooms . This is the fourth room you 've been in ? I thought you said you 'd been wandering these rooms for hours . Yeah . That 's ... That 's the weird thing , isn 't it ? Each one of these rooms has 6 of these doors , or portals . But no matter how many different door , or portals , I go through , I always wound up in the same 3 rooms ... It 's as if the rooms are moving around or something . Yeah . But I don 't feel any motion . Do you ? No . That 's what is so strange . I ran into this guy who ... [ whirring ] Oh , no ! It 's getting closer . I don 't know . Something 's coming after us , and I don 't think it likes us . I don 't hear any people , hon . I think it 's just motors ... Please , we have to get out of here right now ! Any suggestion on which way to go next ? Your guess is as good as mine . I don 't know . Please ! We have to move ! OK . Sasha , we 're gonna have to climb a bit of a ladder , all right ? Hold onto me . Move quickly . Just get me out of here . Man : Help ! Help me ! Oh , god ! There 's a guy hanging . I can 't hold him much longer ! OK ! I 'm coming ! I 'm coming ! Sasha : What 's happening ? Hurry ! Hang on ! Hang on ! Hang on ! Hang on ! I 'm coming ! I 'm coming ! Don 't let me go . Good girl . Good girl . Sasha , you 're gonna be OK . You just stay right here , all right ? You 're gonna be OK . [ Door opens ] There you are . I see you found some friends , huh ? Help me get them down . Fantastic . I 'm losing him ! OK , give me some space . I 'm gonna loosen the belt . All right . I got him . I 'm losing him . Ready ! You got it ? Hurry ! Here he goes ! [ Panting ] OK . Just a sec . But not yet . I got him . Slowly ! Slowly ! Easy ! I got his legs . Lean him up against this wall here . OK , watch his head . That 's it . Make sure he 's upright . He 's alive . He 's breathing . Good . And he 's military . Colonel Thomas H. Maguire , department of defense . Jesus Christ . He 's Pentagon high-tech liaison . You ? How the hell would you know ? A buddy of mine is doing 10 to 20 upstate for cracking the mainframe on the Pentagon 2 years ago . I helped him write the code . I figure maybe that 's why I 'm in here . You know for sure we 're in a prison , or are you just talking out of your ass ? I 'm assuming that ... You know what they say about that . Ha ha ha ... Thanks . That 's good . That 's helpful . Jerry Whitehall . Thanks . Simon Grady . That 's Kate , Sasha ... I 'm sorry . I didn 't get your name . Max Reisler . Max . Kate : Sasha . Sasha . Jerry , could you ... Oh , yeah , yeah . Sure . Of course . It 's all right . Just sit up . Here . Let 's get you sitting up straight here , fella . Sasha , you OK ? This man 's been beaten ... Badly . He 's been tortured . Look at his hand . Cigarette burns . Sasha : They 're coming for us next . Don 't you worry . I 'm not gonna let anyone hurt you . I hope it 's that easy , Kate . There 's nothing in here . What do you think ? Well , I figure he knows something , something that he didn 't want anyone to know . That 's usually why people are tortured . Max : How do you know , Mr. cigarette burns ? What are you , an expert ? Well , as a matter of fact , you weedy little shit ... [ door opens ] Sasha : They 're coming . They 're coming . They 're coming . They 're coming . Aah ! Ooh ! Hello . Do you know where the showers are ? I seem to be lost again . I always get lost in this gym . I don 't know why my daughter-in-law insists on bringing me here . It 's all the way across town . Ooh ! Watch your step . Watch your step . One rung at a time . Here we go . Woman : Thank you , dear . Oh , my goodness . I 'm afraid I can 't help you with the showers . I 'm Jerry . Hi . Oh . You 're not little Jerry Reeseback , are you ? Oh , thank goodness . He 's my paper boy , and I owe him $ 10 . Right . Well , this is Simon . Oh . Kate and Sasha . Hello . And , uh ... Max . Max . Max . And you are ? I 'm Mrs. Paley . How do you do , Mrs. Paley ? You don 't happen to know oh , dear . I was never very good at philosophy . [ Laughter ] Do any of us know what 's going on here ? Sorry . I 've been trying to get a handle on the configuration of these rooms . All I can say is ... They just don 't make any sense . That 's right . They sure don 't . It 's as if the rooms are moving around very quickly . There 's got to be some kind of logic to it . I mean , these rooms just seem to ... Repeat . You go in one direction , and the room just loops back on itself . [ Whirring ] It 's getting closer . Sasha , do you know what " it " is ? Not really , but I can hear it ... All the time , even when you don 't . And it sounds ... It feels wrong . Maybe we 're in hell . All right . All right . Let 's get some real answers . His answer was suicide . Not exactly a comforting thought . OK , soldier , up on your feet . Hey , careful . He 's hurt . Come on , pumpkin ! Up you come ! Stop it ! He 's in serious condition . Kate , listen to me , sweetheart ! I 'm not your sweetheart , asshole . You want to be next when they come for us ? Who exactly are " they " ? I 'm going to find out . Come on , tiger . Let 's go . Jerry : If he dies , you 'll get no information whatsoever . Whoa ! Jesus Christ ! Oh ! It 's here . What the fuck ? Come on ! OK , he 's conscious . Come on , soldier . Talk to me , soldier . OK , talk to me . What 's going on here ? Are you speaking to me ? OK , just tell me ... How do we get out of here ? I don 't know . You figure out the code , you get out . The first one had rules ... The first one ? What are you talking about ? Leave him alone . He 's delirious . Look , he knows something , all right ? I 'll carry him myself . Just give us something . Maguire : The first cube had numbers . What do you mean , " the first one " ? What the hell are you talking about ? I 'm out of here . Uh ! Oh , my god . Are you OK ? Did you hit your head ? Yeah . I slipped . It 's the wall . It wiggled . Are you sure you 're OK ? Look ! There it goes again ! Jerry : Th-th-that 's a ... I don 't know . Aah ! Holy fuck ! What is that ? Simon : I don 't know . But I don 't think we should stick around to find out . Come on ! Let 's go ! Come on , Sasha . Come on . I 'm right behind you , hon . Easy , easy , easy . Hurry up . Oh , for Christ 's sake . Kate : What the ... Paley : Oh , my ! [ Rumbling ] [ All talking at once ] Move it ! Move it ! Move it ! It 's time for us to go . I 'm not done with you yet . I 'm not going . What did you do that for ? I 'm not going anywhere soon . Well , fuck you ! Come on , Kate . Let 's get out of here . Do you have the key ? You mean this ? Yeah . No ! What did you do that for ? You don 't honestly think you can escape ? We have to try . Uh ! Oh , my god . This is gonna hurt . Kate , get the hell up here . No . I 'm not leaving without him . For god 's sake , he 's a dead man ! Move ! There 's no time left ! Let 's go ! I 'm not leaving him behind . You can go on ahead . Oh , my god . There 's got to be a way . Kate , get the hell out of there . Oh , my god . Leave him ! He 's dead ! Oh , my god ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Let me go ! Let me go ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! [ Screaming continues ] Simon : It 's still coming ! Come on ! [ Rumbling ] So , what the hell happened back there , huh ? I don 't know . Paley : Oh . Hello . And where did you come from ? What 's your name ? I 'm ... I 'm Kate . Don 't you remember me ? Oh . Mrs. Paley . The colonel was our only link to this place . Maybe not . Uh ... I designed the door panels in here ... The touch sensors . Well , I was freelancing for a subcontractor . You know , I ... You didn 't think this was worth mentioning before ? Well , I signed a confidentiality ... Given our current situation , I 'd say it 's null and void ! Jesus Christ . They 're legal and ... What the hell is this place ? ! You don 't think the guy that makes the toilets in the space shuttle you must have some idea what they were building . It was experimental , you know . It was a prototype . For what ? I 'm not sure . Leading-edge stuff . There were rumors . What kind of rumors , Jerry ? What rumors ? ! Quantum teleportation . Pardon ? They were just rumors . That 's all . You mean like ... " Beam me up , Scotty " ? Kate : OK . Now this is getting ridiculous . What do you know , Jerry ? Nothing . You 're lying . Because both you and the colonel work for them . Them ? Who the hell are " them " anyway ? What ? The government ? The mafia ? Aliens ? Paley : Oh , my goodness . It 's a tesseract . Oh , Christ . She 's losing it . Isn 't it beautiful ? Isn 't what beautiful , Mrs. Paley ? Holy shit . If you look at it from just the right angle ... What did you call it again , Mrs. Paley ? Oh , it 's a tesseract , sweetheart . Tesseract . Yeah . Ha ha ha . Tesseract . It 's a tesseract . How do you know it 's a tesseract , oh , is the second act beginning already ? We should be getting back to our seats . Excuse me . Yeah . She for real ? Jerry : Ha ha ha ! A tesseract . Holy Christ . Of course . A tesseract . Ha ha ha ! Jerry , are you OK ? Yeah . I can 't believe I didn 't see it before . It 's been staring at us in the face the whole time . Maybe you could share with the rest of the class . Oh , of course . Look , a tesseract . It 's another name for a ... A hypercube . A what ? A hypercube . A 4-dimensional cube . All the elements are there . Rooms repeating , rooms folding in on themselves . Teleportation . It could all very well add up . Well , look . Here . See ? Let 's call one dimension length and represent that with a simple line . Now , 2 dimensions are length and width . Huh ? Which can be represented by a simple square . Now , if we extend that square one more dimension ... We get a cube , which has 3 dimensions ... Length , width , and depth . Come on . We all passed the eighth grade . Hush . Now , here 's the really funky part . If you take this cube and we extend it one more dimension , we get ... Max : I always thought time was considered to be the fourth dimension . Sure . That 's one idea , but what if you have a fourth spatial dimension ? There 's no such thing . Hey , buddy , why don 't you shut up ? OK , OK . Let 's just say that we are in this hypercube , whatever . Does this diagram show us how to get out ? Well , um ... A hypercube isn 't supposed to be real . It 's just a theoretical construct . Oh . Well , that makes me feel better . Is there a theory on how we might get out of this theoretical construct ? Well , I don 't know . Paley : Oh , don 't worry , dear . It 's just a matter of time . Oh , that 's so much clearer . Thank you . Max : Right . Anyway , here 's my theory , for what it 's worth . We are all unwilling participants in a game show and are being videotaped as we speak . The forceful abduction of innocent people for such purposes , we could all take comfort in the fact that once the show airs , we 'll be able to parlay this into some lucrative sponsorship deals . OK , Max . And what 's the object of this game show ? Hmm ... I don 't know . To get out alive ? I think we should make a map . I don 't think a map 's gonna really help us . Look at that . That wasn 't there a minute ago . Did you write that ? No . I left my wings at home . I just marked this room as 10 before . Somebody 's been here before us . A really large someone . Why would someone go through the trouble of writing it on the ceiling ? 60,659 rooms ? Christ . This place must be huge . Paley : Oh , yes . Yes . In a hypercube , there could be 60 million rooms . She could be right . There 's a comforting thought . Ah ... [ Door opens ] What the hell are you doing ? Yowza . The ratings on this show just doubled . Simon : What do you see ? A girl . I 'm going in . I think I got to puke . You all right ? I just ... Aah ! Get back here ! What 's happening ? What 's going on ? Try to give me your hand . Help me ! You OK ? What 's going on ? Max , don 't be an idiot . Come on back . No . It 's OK . Jesus . The gravity shifted . Wow . So , are we going in there or what ? Maybe she knows something . What about our ... Less agile members ? I have an idea . [ Door opens ] Hello ? Kate : Whoa ! I 'm all right . Miss ? Hey , miss . Hey . Wake up . She 's on her way . Guess it 's time for plan " B. " Why don 't you give her mouth-to-mouth and see if that works ? You think I should ? Oh , very funny . What ? What ? Hi . What 's wrong ? What the hell ? Where am I ? That 's the million - dollar question . [ Laughing hysterically ] Does she have to keep cackling like that ? Come on . Let 's just get this over with . I don 't know what ... Ha ha ha ! All right , this is gonna be some kind of fucking day . Yeah , Mrs. Paley , just keep laughing there . Oh , god . Paley : Ha ha ha ! This is more fun than I 've had since my ... Ooh ! ... 13th birthday ! I 'm glad somebody 's having fun . This reminds me of that old hoop swing for Christ sakes , Mrs. Paley , this isn 't a game ! Come on . Come on down . Simon , you guys keep her steady . All right , all right . Come on . OK , and you 're down . That 's good . Oh ! We 've landed . Simon : It 's your turn . You 'll have to climb around the sides . Pull this fucking thing up . Oh , Christ . This is gonna be fun . Oh , hello there . I 'm Mrs. Paley . Who the hell are you people ? Uh ... Well , I 'm Kate , and this is Mrs. Paley . And I am Julia . And this is ... Hey , is this your jacket ? No . Well , then how did I ... I must have had more to drink last night than I thought . There 's nothing in here . How the hell did I get here ? I mean , have we been kidnapped ? Now , you know , that 's a really good question . So , does anyone remember how we got here ? Last thing I remember was going to sleep . Where ? In my bed . Where do you live ? Lincoln , Nebraska . Kate , I 'm a healthy , married male white engineer who enjoys reading horror novels and eating chocolate ice cream as well as climbing around psycho jungle gyms . Ha ha ha . OK . Um ... I remember driving home from Maine state hospital . It was late , and I just wanted to get home . I 'd been working long hours . I 'm a psychotherapist . Simon . New haven . I was out for a drink . What do you do ? I 'm a consultant ... A management consultant . Max : Yeah , right . And I 'm Santa Claus . OK , Max , how about you ? I live in Palo alto . I design computer games . The last thing I remember , I fell asleep on my keyboard . Sasha , hon , where do you live ? New Mexico . I was doing my homework in the kitchen , like I always do . Nothing ever happens to me . The last thing I remember ... Is taking the dog for a walk . Julia ? I was at an after-party for a premiere in Santa Monica . Are you an actress ? Uh , no . No , I 'm an attorney . Well , let 's just say , if I was kidnapped , it was for the ransom . OK , so we got silicon valley , Connecticut , Nebraska , Hollywood , Maine . Mrs. Paley , where exactly do you live ? Oh , in that high-rise at the corner of riverside and 94th . Could you give me a lift home , dear ? I seem to have lost my daughter-in-law . Ignorance is bliss . This doesn 't make any sense . Simon : Yeah . Well ... I think they probably flew us here flew us out here in private or military jets . That 's what I think . But where is here ? Simon : I don 't know . Your guess is as good as mine . Jerry : They could have built a hypercube structure anywhere . And if this thing really does fold space , we could be literally anywhere . What the hell ? What ? Kate : Here 's that number again . 60659 . This can 't be the same room . Because now they 're in a string of other numbers . There just can 't be that many rooms . Maybe they 're not room numbers . Maybe somebody else figured something out . We are definitely not alone . Check this out . What is it ? What 's happening ? Julia , is that your watch ? No . No . It 's mine . It ... Well , this is bizarre . Max : What ? Somebody else has a watch just like yours ? Look . Somebody 's playing games with us . Oh , shit . Look . This is the watch that my wife gave me on my 40th . See ? This is the watch we just found . Hey , maybe it 's your game that we 're playing , Jerry . You designed the doors . It 's your watch . What next ? For the love of god , Mrs. Paley ! Mrs. Paley , please don 't ! Oh , my goodness . I think he 's still alive . Mrs. Paley , please ! Easy . Careful . Max : Is there somebody in there ? Simon : Hey , Jerry , what do you see ? Oh , god , there 's a guy down here . Oh ! The gravity 's shifting ! What 's happening ? You OK ? Huh ? You all right ? Hey . Hey , fella . Oh , Jesus . Careful . Uh ! Is he alive ? I don 't think so . Let 's roll him over . [ Gagging ] God , is he ripe ! Ugh ! What ... What is that ? Oh ! He looks pretty dead to me . Paley : Oh , I hope he 's still alive . He 's been here for a while , Mrs. Paley . Who do you think wrote these numbers ? He must have written them himself . It 's the same writing as those numbers we keep seeing . Oh , no . It 's poor Dr. Rosenzweig . You know him ? He 'll never get his Nobel prize now . Who the hell is he ? Holy Christ . Phil Rosenzweig . The leading theoretical physicist in his field . Which was ? Quantum chaos . Oh , god . Phil Rosenzweig . I read his book . [ Gasps ] Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Uh ! Oh , Jesus . Oh , my god . Is he ... Kate , is he ... Yeah , he 's gone . You positive ? Mm-hmm . Somebody . I 'm here , Sasha . Gotcha . Gotcha . Does anyone understand these numbers ? I mean , what was he writing ? Maybe he was trying to calculate his way out of here . It looks like he ran out of time . How did old Mrs. Paley know him ? I don 't know . Hey , look . More numbers . The same handwriting . Max : The question is , did he solve it before he died ? Uh ! She 's OK . She 's OK . Are you OK ? He must have finished it here . Look . There it is again . 60659 . Max : How does that get us out of here ? It 's got to mean something . I don 't know , but we better remember it . You know , I wonder if he 's got a ... Max : What are you doing ? Oh , that 's disgusting . Found a pen . Hope you have better luck than he did . Paley : No , no . This can 't be happening . Oh , dear . Oh , dear . No , just wait . Oh , I am such an idiot . Oh , now wait a minute . You know what ? She 's gonna drive me insane . Paley : Oh , it was right here . What is it , Mrs. Paley ? Izon , where are you ? I am such an idiot . Did she say izon ? Izon , where are you ? You come back here this instant ! Who are you looking for , Mrs. Paley ? Ooh , have you seen my dog ? He 's a darling little shih-tzu . Darn it . Her dog 's name is izon ? That 's weird . A weapons manufacturer . A weapons manufacturer . Yes . And you guys would know that because ... I read the papers . Julia : Mrs. Paley . Paley : Poor puppy . Mrs. Paley , are you sure you didn 't just leave your dog at home ? Oh , no . He was right here . Oh , I 'm such an idiot ! Simon : This breaks my heart . Mrs. Paley . Mrs. Paley . What do you do for a living ? I knew I shouldn 't have let him off the leash . No , Mrs. Paley , before you retired , what did you do ? Oh , nothing very exciting . I was a theoretical mathematician . Where did you work ? Oh , my head hurts . At Skippy research affiliates . Yes , that 's it . It was a ... What do you call it ? A think tank in Washington state . She worked for Skippy research affiliates , and her dog 's name was izon ? Mrs. Paley . Is it possible that you worked for izon research affiliates and your dog 's name is Skippy ? How did you know where I worked ? She worked for a weapons manufacturer ? And she 's a good friend of our Nobel wannabe . [ Softly ] I don 't think we should trust Mrs. funny farm . I 'm not crazy , and I 'm not hard-of-hearing either . I told you no one would believe me . Simon : Mrs. Paley ... What sort of research did you do at izon ? General , I will not be party to this insanity . I 'm not a general . I don 't care what Alex trusk says . It 's impossible , and what 's more , it 's inhuman . Who 's Alex ... Did she say Alex trusk ? Oh , Christ . We 're dead . This is really getting ridiculous . Who is Alex trusk ? Max : Alex trusk , hacker extraordinaire . He 's a legend . This is exactly the kind of twisted maze he 'd create . Alex trusk doesn 't even exist . Some things should never be created . They exist for theoretical purposes only . It would never last . Can 't you understand that ? OK . You 're a shrink . Can you tell me ... What the hell is happening here ? You know , I would say that seeing the dead man triggered some sort of emotional response ... Flashbacks , post-traumatic stress . So she is connected to this , yeah ? Skippy ? Oh , I think I hear him . Mrs. Paley . Mrs. Paley , don 't . Skippy . Mrs. Paley . Skippy . [ Door opens ] Oh , my . Help me . Please . Aah ! Don 't trust the old cunt . She 's lying about everything . Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Simon : Jesus fucking Christ . Sasha : What just happened ? Fuck . My head , man . I lost my fucking head ! Mrs. Paley opened the portal ... Did you see that ? [ Everyone talking at once ] Wait , wait , wait . I have an idea . I think that we 're all tired . We need to calm down , everybody . Wait a minute ! Wait a minute ! [ Whistles ] Let me guess . You designed the floor , too . You better have a really good fucking explanation , Jerry . I know what just happened there was a little ... Shocking , you know , but actually , it makes total sense , if we 're really in a multidimensional quantum environment . Julia : English , please . One fundamental idea of a quantum universe is that parallel realities can actually exist simultaneously . OK , how do you know that , Jerry ? All you designed were the door panels ! I read it in Rosenzweig 's book . It was a big part of his theory , you know . Look , what if whoever designed this ... Stinking thing somehow managed to create a place where parallel realities can cross over like that ? So you 're saying that what we just saw were Simon and Mrs. Paley in a parallel universe ? Yes , yes ! A universe where things turn out a little differently . Max : Oh , please . Think about it . Think about it . Look , Simon , a few minutes before , when you found the watch and when you just realized that somebody else had been marking numbers in the rooms , right ? Well , that 's when I thought that maybe we should leave markers behind in case we doubled back and got sidetracked ... Things like a piece of clothing or jewelry . Then I thought , what a pity it would be to leave my watch , but that I would do it if I had to . OK , Jerry , so what you 're saying we 'd already gotten ourselves into such trouble that you had decided that it was OK to leave your watch ? For crying out loud ! What a load of crap ! There 's got to be a logical explanation . Yeah ? What do you think that is , Max ? You think that this is just an optical illusion or something ? Yeah . Sure . Why not ? Kate : Oh , that 's a sane idea . Why don 't you just go ahead and open that door , then ? Have a look . If you 're so sure it 's an optical illusion , open the door and have a look . You might want to just stand to the side there , pal , in case that thing ... Fuck off , Jerry ! Simon : Hey , hold it ! All right ? Don 't open it . OK , say Jerry 's right . I mean , I think all of this is a hoax , OK ? And I think Jerry 's either full of shit or part of this experiment . Shut the fuck up . I 'm agreeing with you , Max . You see , I think we 're all pumped so full of L.S.D. , and I think we 're hidden in some C.I.A. Hospital in area 51 or whatever . But let 's just say , on the off chance that Jerry ... Jerry 's actually right , then what happens if whatever the fuck it was in there that killed the guy killed me ? What happens if that fucking thing gets in here ? ! Huh ? ! What happens then ? ! You 're all crazy . Hey , man . What are you doing ? Just don 't fucking open the door . What are you so scared of anyway ? I just saw my fucking head taken off by something or other . How 's that for starters ? Jerry : Hey , Simon , where did you get that knife , huh ? It 's mine . I collect knives . Max : He had it when I first saw him . Jerry : That 's kind of convenient , don 't you think ? If anybody 's part of the experiment , maybe ... Maybe you . I 've got it ! I 've got it ! I 've got it ! I 've got it ! Why don 't we all just get some ice cream , and everyone will feel a lot better about everything . [ Simon laughing ] You 're funny , Mrs. Paley . You really are . You 're a funny old lady . You 're also cute and senile . Hey ! You leave her alone . She doesn 't understand . All right . She 's already admitted working for izon , one of the most powerful weapons manufacturers in the world . She recognized the figures on the wall . And she knew the dead guy . Now , maybe my alter ego wasn 't all that wrong . Maybe we shouldn 't trust dear old Mrs. Paley . Sasha : Maybe you 're the one we shouldn 't trust . I beg your pardon ? Maybe you 're the one we shouldn 't trust . Oh . You know , I 'm going to ignore that , little girl , because you 're a cripple . I think we should keep moving , huh ? After you . Sasha : Kate , I 'm really thirsty . Kate : Me , too , sweetheart . Me , too . Paley : I 'm exhausted . Are we there yet ? Jerry : Come on , Mrs. Paley . Just hold on a little longer . Kate : So , who 's this Alex trusk person ? Max : Are you kidding ? He programmed the virus that crashed the Tokyo stock exchange 2 years ago . He 's the one that broke into the air-traffic control grid and crashed those 2 air force jets in Nevada to protest military spending . Jerry : And you forgot the one about Alex trusk being the first genetically engineered superhuman bred in a test tube , who now lives and walks amongst us . Kate : Well , that sounds a bit far-fetched . Alex trusk is a conspiracy theorist 's wet dream . He doesn 't exist . Max : Fine . Just keep fooling yourself . Simon : Would you people just shut up and keep moving . Julia : Do you really believe this stuff about parallel universes ? Kate : If you 'd asked me yesterday , I 'd say no , but this place changes your perception of what 's possible . Look , let 's just keep this between us for now . Yeah , yeah , OK . So here 's the deal . I 'm a private investigator . I 'm on a case ... Missing persons . Well , I think , given our current situation , this counts as irony . Ha ha ha ha . Yeah , right . I think they stuck me in here because of her ... Becky young . They seem to have emptied my pockets of everything else but my knife and this ... Maybe as a message or a warning . Here 's the kicker . Guess who she worked for . Izon ? Oh . Ha ha . Sasha : Kate . Kate ? Kate , you have to wake up . There 's ... Kate : What is it ? What 's wrong ? There 's something here . Do you see anything ? You 're probably just dreaming or some ... Whoa . There is ... There is something . What the hell is that ? Kate ? Kate , what do you see ? It 's a square . It 's just ... Floating . Max : What is it ? Paley : It 's beautiful . Simon : You recognize this too , Mrs. Paley ? Well , not exactly . Sasha : What just happened ? Now there 's 2 . It 's multiplying . Maybe it 's the way out . Max : More drugs . I want to know what this stuff is . Kate : Maybe that 's what a 4-dimensional object really looks like . Simon : If that 's the way out , how do we use it ? I hate it . It sounds wrong . It 's stunning ... The maths of it . It 's a perfect quadrangular oscillation . It 's moving . Mrs. Paley , no ! Aah ! Aah ! Uh ! Oh , Jesus ! Get the fuck out of the way ! Jerry , you 're hurt ! No , I 'm OK . I 'm OK . Max : Look out ! Stay low . Oh , my god ! Get out of here ! Go on ! Come on , Mrs. Paley . It 's time to go . Over here . It looks safe . Come on . Don 't stare at it . Go ! Max : It 's coming back ! Come on , Max ! Go , Julia ! Go ! Paley : Oh , my baby ! We 've got to go . Simon : Come on , for Christ 's sakes ! Oh , my god . Go . Go up the stairs . Aah ! Come on , Mrs. Paley . Keep going . No ! No ! Don 't touch it . Help ! Kate ! Sasha ? Aah ! Jerry ! Oh , Jesus ! No ! Sasha ! Don 't do it , OK ? Just get in here . What the fuck are you doing ? She 's gone , for Christ 's sakes ! You want to end up like Jerry ? ! Uh ! Sasha ! [ Sasha screaming ] Kate ! You 're a dead woman ! Oh . Oh , Jesus . Sasha ? Kate , help ! Kate ! Kate , help ! I 'm coming to get you . Drop to the ground , Sasha , now . Help me . OK , Sasha ... Now ... I can see you , Sasha . Flatten yourself against the wall on the ground and crawl toward me . I can 't ! I 'm scared ! Well , you 've got to move , or I can 't come and get you . Now move . Move towards me . No ! Stop , Sasha ! Don 't Sasha ! Get down ! Aah ! Damn it , Kate ! What do you want me to do ? OK , just keep moving until you hit that corner , and then stay put , all right ? OK ? Sasha ? OK ? I 'm almost there . Just crawl on . Stay on the ground . Good . You made it . I 'm right behind you . There you are . Keep your knees in . Oh , god ! There you are . OK ? It 's OK . It 's OK . You 're good . We 're all OK . What just happened ? I don 't know . I don 't know , Sasha . Oh , sweet Jesus . It 's shrinking . Now it can get us . Please let it be quick . OK , this is what we 're gonna do . We 're gonna make a run for it . Yes , you can . You just got to hold onto me . Now , we 're gonna go to our right . No , we 're gonna go to the left , OK ? All right ? OK ? OK . OK , on the count of 3 . Just hold onto me . 1 ... 2 ... 3 ! OK . I got you . Oh , my god ! Sasha , no ! Sasha , it responds to our movements . Don 't ... Move . Stay still . Don 't ... Oh , my god . Is it gone ? Yeah . Yeah , it 's gone . Thank you ! OK , we did it together . Let 's just get out of here before it comes back , OK ? Now just go up the ladder , OK ? Kate . Yeah ? What ? I can smell it . What ? Did someone die in here ? Yeah . Yeah . Jerry died . Oh , no . He was so nice . We got to go . Here . We got to go , honey . Just get up there , one foot after the other . Where are the others ? I think we 're on our own . OK , you 're doing good . [ Door opens ] I see a pattern . Anyone connected to this ... This hypercube ... Eventually dies a very violent and painful death . Paley : Oh ! I would hate for that to happen to you , Mrs. Paley . I would . So drop the act ... And tell us how we get out of here , huh ? Huh ? Simon . Simon , that 's enough ! OK , shut up ! Simon ... Shut up ! OK . OK , Mrs. Paley , you ready to talk ? [ Muffled ] Because I 'm all ears . I really don 't need this operation , doctor . I 'm in perfect health . Please , just ask my daughter-in-law over there . She 'll explain . OK ? So I 'm gonna give you one more chance , Mrs. Paley . I 'm gonna give you a last chance , OK ? You tell me what I need to know , or I 'm gonna have to kill you . Do you understand ? I 'm going to kill you . It 's your choice . Simon , get away from her . You have a choice to make right now ... Do you want to get out of here or not ? Yes , but ... There are no buts ! Hey , guys ... [ Paley crying ] All right . Oh , shit . Shit . It 's here . It 's gonna take my head off ! [ Struggling ] Let 's go . What about Mrs. Paley ? Goddamn it ! I 'm not gonna die here . You can 't leave her . Why should I help her ? Simon , she 'll die if you leave her ! I 'm gonna regret this . Come on . I 'm trying to get this fucking thing off ! Stay still , for Christ 's sake ! Max : Come on ! Hurry ! Would someone give me a hand ? ! Someone help me to pick her up ! Oh , shit . Let go of me ! Let go of me ! Shit ! I 'm not fucking staying here ! I 'm sorry , Mrs. Paley . I 'm out of here . Let go the fuck of me ! Jesus Christ ! Oh , my god . [ Struggling ] Oh , god . Where do you think you 're going ? Hurry up . Get back here . What the hell ? It could mean anything . Right . Maybe it 's a coordinate of some kind , but in 4 dimensions . Something ... I don 't know . For all we know , it could be somebody 's birthday or zip code or just a serial number . God . You know , I wish I was just ... Smarter . Why do you think you 're in here , Kate ? I don 't know . Maybe I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time . Damn it . You know , there 's got to be some sort of meaning to this . 60659 . 60659 . Maybe they just like to watch us squirm . Max : He is the only one with the resources and brains to create something like this . Julia : OK , Max . Say you 're right . Say it is Alex trusk who 's responsible for all this . I mean , does it help us get out ? No . We 're still stuck here with no clue . And if this is someone 's game , it isn 't a fair one . Max , I mean , do you think ... Max , we got to keep moving . Come on . Max ? [ Distorted ] Max , what 's wrong with you ? [ Distorted ] Holy shit ! Variable time-speed rooms ! Yeah , I guess you could say that . Uh ! Aah ! Holy jumping Jesus . Get your hands off me ! Hello , Jerry . Who the hell are you ? You don 't recognize me ? No . Where am I ? How do you know my name ? You don 't know me ? No ! Where the hell am I ? You don 't ... Wait , wait , wait . You don 't remember me ? What about the senile old broad ? Or the little blind kid ? Or that thing that chopped you up like little pieces of deli fucking meat , Jerry ? ! Now look , friend , I mean you no harm , huh ? Just let me go , and I 'll be on my way . Come on , Jerry . You mean me no harm ? You 're fucking hilarious , Jerry . How long have you been in here , huh ? I don 't know . I just woke up . You just woke ... Holy shit . Holy shit . So maybe you were right before , huh ? You or the other you or whatever . This place does cross over parallel alternate realities , huh ? Hey , look . Have you been drinking ? You know , I ... I really don 't give a shit anymore . What are you talking about , alternate realities ? Can I ask you a question , Jerry ? Do you mind ? Yeah , yeah . OK . Sure . Just ... Just don 't hurt me , huh ? Are you hungry ? Hmm ? Are you ... Hungry ? Yeah ... I guess so . My stomach 's a little ... 'Cause I 'm hungry . I 'm fucking starving . Oh , my god . Kate ... What is it ? Kate , what do ... What do you see ? [ Door closes ] Kate , what 's going on ? I don 't know , Sasha . I mean ... I think , in some other reality , things didn 't turn out so well . Julia : Again with the Alex trusk . Why are you so afraid of this Alex trusk ? Because he 's ruthless . He 's a high-tech genius whose morals make muammar Qaddafi look like mother Theresa . Because they 're throwing anybody connected to this thing in here to fucking die ! [ Echoing ] Max , you 're not connected . Can you keep a secret ? Sure . I love secrets . Last year , I designed a computer game called relativity , where contestants , linked to each other over the Internet , do battle in a 3-d environment using different time signatures . What are you saying ? Are you saying that you designed all this ? Just these variable time-speed rooms , just the concept . It was for a game . Now here we are . Wow . This is really some game , Max . Do you have any other little secrets you want to tell me ? People are dead , OK ? I 'm not responsible for this . It was just a game . I can 't even sell the stupid thing . It 's all involved in a lawsuit . What kind of lawsuit ? I don 't know . Some ... Oh , right . You 're a lawyer . A company called cyber thrill stole it from me . Cyber thrill ? Why ? You 've heard of them ? Yeah . Are you into computer games ? Settle . Excuse me ? I strongly recommend that you settle . You 'll never win . How do you know that ? You 're not up against cyber thrill . They 're just a subsidiary . Who owns them ? Izon . How do you know that ? Because I ... I represent them . [ Echoing voice ] Hello ... Anybody there ? Hello ... I must be hearing things . [ Echoing voice ] Hello ... Jerry : Finally . I was beginning to wonder if I was the only one in here . Look , do you need a hand there ? You 're upside down . Ha ha ha . Do you have any idea what 's going on here ? Careful . Careful . Watch your step there . It 's crazy . You 're not the only person here , Jerry . There 's lot of people just like you , Jerry . Hey , buddy , how do you know my name ? We 've met before , Jerry . Yeah . Ooh , I get this mouth-watering feeling when I talk to you , Jerry . What do you mean ? Hey , come here . Look at this . Hey ! Hey ! What ? ! Aah ! Look at this . Aah ! Aah ! Why don 't you just go ? I 'm blind , Kate . I 'm a burden . You can move faster without me . Sasha , please , I know how you 're feeling . No , you don 't . You 've no idea how I 'm feeling . Look , I know this seems hopeless ... No , it 's not ! I 'm gonna figure this out ! " Figure it out . " Trust me , precious ... If I haven 't figured it out , you sure as shit aren 't going to . What did you just say ? I 'm sorry , Kate . I didn 't mean to ... No , no , no . Wait a second . Back that up . Why do you think that you should be able to figure this out ? I wasn 't kidnapped . When I found out they were putting people in here , I tried to blow the whistle on them . So they came after me , and I escaped into the one place they wouldn 't dare follow me ... In here . Poetic justice , don 't you think ? Who are you ? Max was right . Jerry was wrong . I exist . Oh , my god . Sasha . Of course . Sasha is a nickname for Alexandra . Alex trusk . Alex trusk . Pleased to make your acquaintance . This is the worst nightmare I 've ever had . I just wish I 'd wake up . You really think this is all a dream ? In the real world , I 'd never kiss you . Oh , really ? Yeah . You 're not my type . You 're not my type either . [ Door opens ] Aah ! Aah ! Becky young . Yeah . " Rebecca young . " Yeah . Who ... Who are you ? Who am I ? I 'm Simon Grady . Your parents hired me ... To find you . Really ? Yeah , yeah . Thank god ! Yeah . I 'm happy to see you , too , Becky . I 've been wandering these rooms for hours . Uh ! Uh ... You got to love these parallel universes . You built this thing ? I gave them the key to build it ... Better than they wanted . I gave them a real hypercube . OK , so how do we get out ? Kate , this isn 't a game . There 's no happy ending . This place is out of control . It 's not stable . Does this number mean nothing ? 60659 ? I mean , it 's got to mean something . It 's everywhere . I 'm sorry , Kate . It 's over . No , it is not over . Not yet . Uh ! I refuse to die here . What the hell ? Oh , my god . We 've got to move ! Come on ! We 've got to get out of here . Leave me ! No . You 're coming with me . Oh , my god . We 've got to get out of here . Just go up as fast as you can . Faster ! Faster ! Faster ! Faster ! Keep going . OK . Good girl . OK . What the hell ? Oh , my god . OK , we 've got to get out of here . This is insane . It 's ... Jerry 's diagram . It 's all the numbers . They 're all just suddenly in here . It 's Jerry 's markings and ... That dead physicist 's equations ... And that damn colonel 's corpse just hanging there as if we never even rescued him . Everything keeps appearing over and over and over again . Please , you have to have some idea what this means . All the realities are starting to collapse into one space . And what happens to us when they ... It collapses ? The whole thing implodes . It 's only a matter of time . I 'm not gonna just stand here while it happens . Kate 's voice : I 'm not leaving him behind ! Simon : For god 's sake , he 's a dead man ! Move ! Kate 's voice : Oh , my god ! No ! Let me go ! Simon : Kate , get the hell up here ! Oh , my god . Sasha : Kate . We don 't have much time . Uh ! No ! I refuse to die here ! I wish I had your spirit , Kate . Hello , gorgeous . Miss me ? Huh ? Come on in . The water 's fine . Uh ! Aah ! [ Sasha screams ] Hello , Kate . Let her go . Who are you ? Yeah . Yeah , it 's me . Good old Simon . Do you remember this ? Huh ? Do you ? Well , I 've waited a long time for payback . But that was just seconds ago . Don 't be so stupid , Kate . You know time works differently in this place . Hmm ? Uh ! Hey ! Just ... OK . Just ... Just let her go . She 's just a kid . Yes . And she 'll be a dead little kid unless you come here to papa . OK . OK , Simon . You just let her go , and then we can figure something out , OK ? Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . You take her place . Yeah ? What do you want ? I 'm hungry . Simon . Hmm ? There 's no point . We 're all dead anyway . Oh . Oh . OK . No ! Well , come on , Kate . The fun 's just beginning . Oh , my god . What the hell ? Aah ! I 'm really going to miss you , Kate . Aah ! Aah ! 60659 ... Of course . 60659 . It 's an expiration date . He figured out when it 's gonna implode . Man : Hello , Kate . Welcome back . So , you figured it out . Yes , sir . No time to spare . The device ... Any luck ? We 'll take that to Darcy and see if anything recorded on it . [ Gunshot ] [ Telephone rings ] [ Ring ] Sir ? Yes , sir . Phase 2 is terminated . I see . Yes , sir . Right away , sir .

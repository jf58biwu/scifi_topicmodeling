 There 's simply no way to shield against every weaponized agent . I nstead , I can make super-immune systems ... by strengthening the human cellular response . Banner , I know where you 're going . But manipulating the immune system is dangerous and stupid . Thepresident 's science advisors made it absolutely clear- - no human subjects . [ Sizzling ] David , I have wonderful news . I ' m gonna have a baby . [ Woman Groaning ] [ Scream i ng ] [ Screaming Continues ] [ Wai I i ng ] [ Wailing Continues ] [ Cooi ng ] What 's it gonna be . Whoa , look at that , Bruce . Huh ? . Want a dinosaur ? . Let 's have a little flight . [ Roaring ] [ Bruce Roaring ] [ David ] You don 'tscare me . [ Roaring Continues ] That 's a delicious eyeball . Ooh , you 're big and green and scary . I 'm gonna run away . Really , speaking ofiCheryl , guess what- - Bruce , you 're hurt ! Jack hit him with the stick , but Bruce wouldn 't hit him back . He just stood there , shaking . [ Whispers ] It 's okay . Yeah , strange he didn 't make a peep . Any other kid would 've wailed his head ofifi . That 's Bruce . He 's like that . He 's just so ... bottled up . The samples we fiound in your lab- - theywere human blood . You 've ignored protocol . You had no right snooping around in my lab . That 's my business . Wrong , Banner . It 's government business , and you 're ofifithe project . Attention , all personnel . Fail-safie has been initiated . [ Alarm Blaring ] Gamma decontamination will occur in 30 minutes ! Evacuate immediately ! I repeat , evacuate immediately ! [ Siren Blaring ] [ Gasps ] [ Siren Continues Blaring ] - Edith ? . - David , what 's going on ? . - I gotta talk to you , Edith . - Bruce , stay here . [ Edith ] What are you doing ? . [ Edith , David Talking , Muffled , Faint ] [ Muffled Talking Continues ] [ Yelling , Roaring ] [ Yelling , Roaring Continue ] [ Edith Screams ] What areyou doing ?

Already ofifi to college . Gonna miss you terribly . I 'll miss you too . Please , come here . Look atyou . Soon to be a great scientist . I guess . I mean , who knows ? . I do . There 's something insideyou ... so special . Some kind ofi greatness . I 'm sure somedayyou 're gonna ... share it with the whole world . But as fiar as I 'm concerned , security oughta be- - Good morning . Good morning , Dr. Krenzler . Security oughta be beefied up . In a place like this you can 't be too carefiul . Bruce ! Big day . Did you sleep ? . I didn 't sleep . I slept okay . Is Betty here ? . She 's around . I really gotta say , seeing you in that stylin ' head wear- - You 're implying something about my helmet ? . You look like a massive nerd , even around other scientists . Can Ijust ask- - Wereyou wearing the helmet while she dumpedyou ? See , it protects my very important brain , Harper . Go prep the samples . - Hey . I fiound you . - Betty , hey . I hate them . Wait , I just got here . Who do we hate ? . The review board . We have to make a presentation on Tuesday . Ah . And you 're gonna make it with me . You think I should ? . Yeah . You 're great with that stufifi . You start talking about microbes and nanomeds , you sound almost ... passionate . I 'm sorry . That was rude . Look , nobody expects this to be easy , us working together afiter being ... so close . We were close ? . [ Chuckles ] Look , ifi I could be more ... whatever , you know- - I 'm ... just- - Don 't . It 's not your fiault . Really . You 're just a by-product ... ofi my inexplicable obsession with emotionally distant men . I 'll get over us . Good fioryou . Anyway , I 'm just really stressed about this review . Ifiwe don 't get impressive results today , we 're gonna have a really hard sell come Tuesday . Well , then , let 's go be impressive . [ Typing On Keyboard ] Harper ? . Readywhen you are . Let 's hit it . Are we passing inspection ? . Safeties all going green . Countdown 's started . Nanomeds released . Four seconds . Okay , nanomeds fiully dispersed . Okay , let 's hit Freddie with the gamma radiation . Gamma exposure . Nanomeds now active . [ Harper ] Nanomeds replicating cells on border . It 's working . [ Harper ] Cell copyto disassemble ratio holding within one percent . [ Harper ] Imbalanced nanomed activity . [ Sighs ] You wanna go to the review board on Monday and tell ' em ... we 've developed a brand-new method fior exploding firogs ? . Yeah , I think maybe there 's a market fior it . I mean , what ifi there 's a plague ? . What have you had , Betty , like , one beer ? . I 'm just sa- - I 'm just saying , you know , firogs start flailing firom the sky , who do they come to ? . We 'd be world-renowned . Make anyparent proud . I bet theywould be . They actually did want me to be a scientist . I mean , your birth parents . Guess we 'll never know . [ Sighs ] I don 't understand whyyou don 't want to fiind out about them . They 're dead . They died befiore I can remember anything . Why doyou always come back to this ? . Don 't know . I guess I fiigure there 's more toyou than you like to show . I guess there couldn 't be any less . Right . So now we come fiull circle back to that . Nice work , Betty . Betty . Glen . Hey . Hi . [ Chuckles ] Hi . What happened toyour unifiorm ? . Oh , I , uh- - I switched over . I 'm still working with your fiather , but- - Well , you know , the military 's subcontracting out all the most interesting work , and- - Can 't argue with a paycheck . I basically run all the labs on the base now . Oh . Hey , you 're uh- - you 're looking good . You 're the genetics expert . Ah , the good old college days . So , how 's business ? . What do you want ? . [ Clears Throat ] All right , I 'll cut to the chase . I 've been hearing interesting things about whatyou guys are doing here . Your little molecular machines have some incredible implications . Howwould you like to comeworkfior Atheon ? . Get paid 1 0 times as much as you earn now ... and own a piece ofithe patents . You just have to say the word . Two words : the door . [ Sighs ] General ? . Come in . Talbot wanted you to see this , sir . It 's about a lab Atheon is targeting fior acquisition and removal to desert base . Why isn 't it going through N.S.C. ? . It , uh , concerns your daughter , sir . Hi . Sorry . Hey , what happened to Benny ? . Is he not working the night shifit anymore ? . Benny 's dead . I 'm the new guy . Oh . Good to meet you . Same . [ Camera TimerBuzzing ] - [ Click ] - Let 's try another . Mmm , no . Stay here . I look tired anyway . Yeah , but you look great . What 's the matter ? . [ Chuckles ] It 's these dreams , Doctor . I keep having them , and they 're terrible . Tell me aboutyour dream . Well , it starts- - it starts with a memory- - I think it 's my fiirst memory . It 's this image I have ... firom when I was maybe twoyears old . Doyou think it 's just a dream ? . No , I think it 's something that happened ... when I was living at a desert base with my fiather . [ Betty ] Anyhow , the dream goes on and ... suddenlyI 'm alone . That 's terrible . You know I 'd never hurt you . [ Sighs ] [ Whimpering ] [ Rattling ] [ Panting ] Hey there . [ Continues Panting ] What 'syourname , darlin ' ? Eh ? . What 's your name ? . [ Snarling ] Okay . It 's okay . [ Panting Continues ] [ Footsteps ] [ KeysJangling ] [ Typing ] [ Typing Continues ] [ Sighs ] [ David ] I gotta talk to you , Edith . [ Edith ] Bruce , stay here ! [ T errifiied Gasp ] [ Panting ] [ Dog Whimpering ] [ Man ] " C ... T ... G ... A ... G. " Bruce . My Bruce . Good morning . Glen dropped by . What 's he doing here ? . You know , Dr. Krenzler , you and I have never had the chance to get to know each other properly . Well , that 's because I don 't want to get to know you , properly or improperly . [ Beeping ] So leave . Hey , no worries . Let me give you a little heads-up . There is a hairsbreadth between firiendly ofifier ... and hostile takeover . I 've done my homework . The workyou 're doing here is dynamite . Think : GIs embedded with technology ... that makes them instantlyrepairable on the battlefield ... in oursole possession . That 's a hell ofi a business . Well , it 's not what we 're doing here . We 're doing the basic science fior everyone . You know , someday I 'm gonna write a book ... and I 'm gonna call it When Stupid Ideals Happen To Smart , Penniless Scientists . I n the meantime , Bruce , you will be hearing firom me . About Glen , I , um- - There 's nothing to talk about . Okay . I just wanted to say , don 't worry about him- - I 'll handle it . How ? . I 'm gonna call my fiather , ask him to exertsome pressure . Last I heard , you and your fiather weren 't speaking . Hmm . Well ... I guess now I have something to talkwith him about . I think this circuit 's kinda fried . I don 't know . Maybe you wanna come take a look at it . Okay , I 'll be right there . [ Crackling ] Aah ! [ Harper Groaning ] The gamma 's too high ! Bruce , I can 't stop it ! Harper , get out ! Get out ! [ Door Opens ] How 's Harper ? . He 's all right . You saved him . I don 't think he 's coming back to the lab fior a while , though . [ Sighs ] I don 't understand how this is possible . You should be dead . [ Sighs ] Theyworked- - the nanomeds . I mean , I fieel great . I fieel like- - I don 't know . They must have , like , fiixed me . Bruce , they 've killed everything else that they 've come into contact with . Are you sure the doctor checked ? . The doctor gave me the fiull workup . He wants to know where he can get what I 'm taking . I 'm a hundred percent . More . What doyou mean ? . Remember my bad knee ? . Well , now it 's my good knee . Bruce , this isn 't fiunny . I was watching you . You were gonna die , and I was gonna have to watch you die . Betty ... I 'm sorry . Really . Hey , I 'm not gonna explode . Okay ? . Yeah . [ Snififling ] You should get some rest . And I 'm fline . Really . I 've never fleit better . [ Panting , Gasping ] [ Quiet Growling ] Your name is not Krenzler . It 's Banner . What ? . Your name- - it 's Banner . Bruce Banner . Bruce . How did you get in here ? . I work here now . In the labs . The late shifit . It keeps me close toyou . You always work so lateyourself with your firiend Miss Ross . No , no . Please . Please . Let me . You 're not well . You 've had a terrible accident . You 're wondering whyyou 're still alive . You 're thinking there 's something inside . Something dififierent ... inexplicable . I can helpyou understand , ifiyou 'll let me . Ifiyou 'll ... fiorgive me . Look , mister , I 'm sure I have nothing to fiorgiveyou fior . So perhaps you should leave now . I 'll be fline . You must know . You may not want to believe it , but I can see it in your eyes . So much likeyour mother 's . Ofi course , you 're my flesh and blood . But then , you 're something else too , aren 'tyou ? . My physical son , but the child ofi my mind too . No . You 're lying . My parents died when I was a small boy . No , no , that 's not true . That 's what theywanted you to believe . The experiments , the accident- - all top secret . They put me away fior 30 years . Thirtyyears ! Away firom you . Away firom ourwork . But they couldn 't keep me fiorever . Afiter all , I 'm sane . They had to admit it . You see , everything ... your extraordinary mind ... has been seeking all theseyears ... it 's been insideyou . Now we will understand it . We will harness it . [ Phone Rings ] No , don 't answer it . It 's Miss Ross again . There 's something you need to know about her , Bruce . Something troublesome . Let me protect you firom her . No . Get out . - Bruce- - - Get out ! - [ Barking , Snarling ] - Sit ! [ Dogs Whimpering ] [ Trembling ] We 're gonna have to watch that temper ofiyours . [ Gas Hissing ] [ Whimpering ] [ Snarling ] [ Snarling Continues ] You sureyou 're okay ? . Yeah , just glad to be out ofibed . Got a message firom my fiather . He 's coming to see me . Your fiather ? . Mmm . When ? . Lands in about an hour . [ Betty ] The funnything is , he called me . Hi , Dad . Hello , Betty . [ Waitress ] Here , ma 'am . Thanks . You 're welcome . Sir ? Thankyou . You 're welcome . Look , I ' m gonna get right to it . It 's about Glen , isn 't it ? . He 's been snooping around my lab . Glen noticed some things , asked me to make some inquiries . Areyou here to ... question me ? . No . We 've turned up some surprising things . This Krenzleryou workwith- - you know who he reallyis ? How much doyou actually know about him ? . I think the question is , what is it that you know about him ? . - Well , right now , I 'm not- - - Not at liberty to disclose it to me . Right . Right . You know , I think I was hoping that ... maybe this timeyou just ... honestlywanted to see me again . - You 've got this all wrong , Betty . - Do I ? . Yes . I do want to seeyou . I reallywish that I could believeyou . [ David ] Everything ... your extraordinarymind has been seeking ... all theseyears , it 's been inside you . [ Phone Rings ] [ Ringing Continues ] [ Ringing Continues ] [ On Answering Machine ] Hi , you 've called Dr. Krenzler . Please leave a message and I 'll callyou right back . [ Answering Machine Beeps ] [ Betty On Machine ] Bruce , hey . Are you there ? Look , um , I think I screwed up . My father- - It 's like he suspects you ofsomething . I don ' t know . - [ Thud ] - I was so impatient , like always . I didn ' t hear him out . I don 't know , I- - Ijust think that they 're planning something with the lab . So , um , uh- - [ Grunts ] Call me . Okay ? Bye . - [ Receiver Hangs Up ] - Betty ? . [ Growl i ng ] [ Bruce Roaring ] [ Groani ng , Scream i ng ] [ Yel I i ng ] Dispatch ! Dispatch !

I had the most vivid dream . [ Sighs ] Itwas like being born . Coming up fior air . Light hitting myfiace . Screaming . My heartbeat- - itwas , like , boom ... boom ... boom . Wereyou at the lab ? . No . But something- - And there was that man . The one with the dogs . Who ? . That new janitor . He said he was my fiather . [ Knocking ] I 'll get it . [ Mouths Words ] My fiather . My , my . So this is the young Bruce Ban- - Krenzler . I thinkyou lefit something in your lab last night . [ Wallet Lands On Table ] Mitchell . Escort my daughter outside . I 'lljoin hershortly . I 'd rather stay here . Now , Betty . It 's okay . I ' ll be fline . Keep him under observation . I ' ll be back . [ Car Door Closes ] [ Seat Belt Buckles ] What ? . Your firiend in there . There 's a good chance he 's caught up in some very bad business . Unfiinished business . And I promiseyou , I 'm gonna get to the bottom ofiit . You have myword I 'll make sure he 's cared fior . But as ofi right now , he is incommunicado . And fior the next flew days at least , you 're gonna stay away firom here . Foryour own good . Okay , and that 's fior the new guy on the night shifit , right ? . Great . Thankyou . I appreciate it . [ Dogs Barking ] Dr. Ross . [ Scofifis Quietly ] How unexpected . Please come in . I 'm sorry to just show up at your house like this . Uh- - I came to askyou something that ... I really have no business asking . He told you ? . He said you talked to him . Oh . Please sit down . Bruce was at the lab last night . He said thatyou were there too . But he can 't remember much about it . I needto findout what happened . So , you want to know , uh , what 's wrong with him ... so you can flix him ? . Cure him , change him . My fiather 's with the military . He seems to think he 's involved in some kind of threat to national security . Mmm . Yourfiather . Ross . You broughtyourfather down upon his head ? How little you understand , Miss Ross , and how dangerous your ignorance has become . I 'm sorry . Don 't be sorry . Myson is ... unique . That 's why you can 't relate to him . Andbecause he is unique , the world will not tolerate his existence . Will they ? But you- - you try , don 't you ? . Yes . And a very beautifiul woman like you , your attentions ... can 't be completely unwanted . Can they ? . No . Not with eyes like yours , watching expectantly , Iovingly . But I 'm afiraid we 're both too late to help him . There 's nothing I can do flor him ... or fioryou . Besides , he 's made it clear he wants nothing to do with me . His choice . Now , ifiyou 'll excuse me , Miss Ross , I have some work to do . And don 't worry about the dogs . You 'll be fline . Just don 't look ' em in the eyes . Good-bye . [ General Ross ] He gets released , anda month later yourlab is destroyed . What a coincidence . So you 're not gonna tell me where he is , are ya ? . How many times do I have to tell you ? . I 'd like to help you , but I just don 't know . You know who I am . Right , Banner ? . Your Betty 's fiather . You 're a high-ranking general . Let 's cut the crap . I 'm the guywho had your fiather tossed away , and a lot more like him , and I 'll do the same with you ifil fieel so disposed . You understand ? . Ifiyou had him tossed away , then why areyou asking me ? . I don 't remember . I was always told my fiatherwas dead . Don 't playwith me ! You were fiouryears old when you saw it . When I saw what ? . You were right there . How could anyone fiorget a thing like that ? . What ? . Oh , some more repressed memories . Just tell me . I 'm sorry , son . You 're an even more screwed-up mess than I thoughtyou 'd be . Until we get to the bottom ofthis , yourlab has been declared a top-secret militarysite ... and you 're not gonna get a security clearance to get back into it ... or any other lab that 's doing anything more interesting than ... trying to fiigure out the next generation ofiherbal hair gel . One more thing . Ifiyou ever ... come within a thousand yards ofi my daughter again , I 'll putyou away fior the rest ofiyour natural lifie . [ Snififis ] Dogs ! [ Barking , Snarling ] Go ! Go get her ! And let nothing stand in yourway ! [ Barking , Snarling Continue ] Go ! [ Phone Rings ] [ Phone Continues Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] Hello ? . [ David On Phone ] Bruce ? . So , they think they can just throw you away as they did me . [ Conversation , Faint ] What 's wrong with me ? . What did you do to me ? . I got a visit today . A very unwelcome visit . I 'm afiraid my hand is being fiorced . What did you do to me ? . You so much want to know , don 'tyou ? . But I think no explanation will serveyou halfias well .. as the experience . In any case , I still don 't quite understand it myselfi . Ifithey 'd only let me work in peace- - Ofi course , my betters would have none ofithat . [ Bruce On Phone ] Soyou experimented onyourself , didn 'tyou ? And passed on to me ... what ? . [ David ] An alteration . Genetic . A defiormity . I guess you could call it that . But an amazing strength too . And now , fiinally unleashed , I can harvest it . No . You 'll do no such thing . I will isolate it and treat it myselfi . I 'll remove it and I 'll kill it befiore it does any real harm . I 'll betyou and your Betty would love to destroy it . But would you really destroy part ofiyourselfi ? . I don 't think so . And as fior Betty , I 'm sending her a surprise visit ... firom some fiour-legged firiends ofi mine . You see , I managed to culture some ofiyourvery own DNA , Bruce , and the results are tremendous . They 're unstable , but very powerfiul . What about my DNA ? . [ David ] Let 's just wait and see what Betty makes ofithe results , huh ? . No . You 're crazy . I won 't letyou . [ Murmuring ] Getyour hands ofifi ofi me . Talbot , what 's this- - Inside , asshole . I wanna talk toyou . Listen , my fiather 's going afiter Betty- - What makes you think you can go behind my back and get Ross to cut me out , huh ? . [ Groans ] Listen to me ! Betty 's in trouble ! [ Both Grunting ] You pathetic fireak . Betty 's in danger . I swear to you , she 'll be killed . I can state the obvious . [ Groaning , Panting ] Something tells meyou aren 't in much ofia position to be making stupid threats to anyone . [ Grunting , Groaning Continues ] Talbot . Yeah ? You 're making me angry . Oh , am I ? . [ Quiet Growling ] [ Growling Continues ] [ Roaring ] [ Growling ] - [ Groans ] - [ Men Shouting ] [ Roaring ] Ohh ! Oh ! [ Man ] I got him ! Open fire !

But I killed them ! [ Grunts ] [ Screams , Gasps ] [ Rapid Panting ] My God . It must be the nanomeds . It must be the gamma exposure . But we 've never seen any efifiect like this befiore . No .

Myfathersent them . He is my fiather . He wanted me to change . He wanted me to change into that mindless hulk . Whywould he want that ? . Can you remember anything ? . Is there anything firom when you were changed ? . It was like a dream . About what ? . Rage . Power . And fireedom . [ Phone Ringing ] Hello ? . Sir . Hello . Dad ? . Betty ! Are you all right ? . I 'm scared . I need your help . Where are you ? . How are you ? . Okay , I guess . I think that somehow ... your anger is triggering the nanomeds . How could it ? . We designed them to respond to physical damage . Emotional damage can manifiest physically . Like what ? . Serious trauma . Repressed memories . Your fiather grilled me about something that happened to me firom early childhood ... that I 'm supposed to remember . He did ? . It sounded bad , but ... I honestly don 't remember . The thing that worries me ... is ... a physical wound is fiinite , but with emotions , what 's to sayit won 't just go on and on ... and start a chain reaction ? . You know what scares me the most ? . When it happens , when it comes over me ... and I totally lose control , I like it . [ BeepingSound ] [ Gasps ] It 's okay . I got you . I 'm sorry . You 'll be okay . It 's just to make you sleep . Target down . Target secure . I 'm going to takeyou someplace safie . Okay ? . Bruce ? . Bruce ? . Bruce ? [ Man Shouts , Indistinct ] [ Man Shouting ] Clear ! Attention on deck . Carry on . [ Betty ] We 're buried out here in the middle ofnowhere . How long are you gonna keep him sedated ? For the rest ofi his natural lifie , ifi I have to . You said I could trust you . I ' m your fiather . You can trust me to do what I think is right , not what you thinkyou want . - He is a human being . - He is also something else . Suppose he gets out , has one ofihis little mood swings ... in a populated area . Yes , I 'm aware ofi the potential danger . I 'm also aware that he saved my lifie . Yeah , firom a mutant French poodle . I 'm indebted to him fior that . He also put three men in a hospital , and Talbot 's barelywalking ! - What doyou want me to do ? . - I wantyou to help him ! - Why is he such a threat toyou ? . - Because I knowwhat he comes firom . He is his fiather 's son , every last molecule ofihim . Hesays he doesn 't know his father , but he 's workin ' in the same exact goddamn field his father did . So either he 's lyin ' ... or it 's somethin ' worse , and he 's- - What ? Predestined to fiollow in his fiather 's fiootsteps ? . I was gonna say " damned . " Ofi course you were . But I 'm a scientist . As a scientist , I believe we can fiigure this out and he can be helped . I knowyou do . Look , whetheryou know or care , I 've got a lot ofi pride in whatyou 've done . But this is too big foryou . Look , I know the government thinks they have a weapon on their hands . Otherwise , he 'd be dead by now . They can probe andprod all they want , and in the meanwhile , just let me try to help him . Nobodyknows him betterthan I do . What did David Banner do to him ? . Cover lefit ! Clear lefit .

Let 's go . Please try . [ Shuddering ] [ Shuddering Continues ] [ Betty ] What is it ? Nothing . Really ? . Damn it . Okay , Betty ... what doyou want to know ? What was in that room ? . What are you afiraid that I 'll see ? . [ Gasps ] See ? . There 's nothing . [ Sighs ] It 's empty . [ Betty ] What doyou mean , I don 't have access to him ? [ Ross ] NSA has decided to turn overstudy ofthe , uh- - the threat to Atheon . But you 're head ofi the base . I thought you were in charge . But I don 't set policy , and I still take orders . [ Yells ] I can 't believe Talbot would go around me like this ! Oh , there 's a lot ofi powerfiul people that want in on this . And moneyto be made- - lots ofit . You know the worst part about all this ? . When I had David Bannerlocked up andsent that kid away , I didn 't give that boy a second thought ; he was just collateral damage .

I 'm not sureyou 've got much ofia choice . [ Screams ] Come on , Bruce . Aren 'tyou feeling a little angry ? Afiter all , you 've only got me to playwith now that Betty 's dumped you and gone back to Berkeley . [ Screams ] You 're lying . You know , fior me this is a win-win situation . You turn green , andall these guys come in and killyou ... and I perfiorm the autopsy . - You don 't ... - [ Screaming Continues ] and I mop the floor with you ... and maybe by accident go too fiar and breakyour neck . Bad science , maybe ... but personally gratifying . [ Screams ] Come on , Bruce ! Let 's see what you got . [ Panting ] Never .

Canyou understand ? To improve on nature . My nature ! Knowledge ofi oneself ! . It 's the only path to the truth ... that give men the power to go beyond God 's boundaries !

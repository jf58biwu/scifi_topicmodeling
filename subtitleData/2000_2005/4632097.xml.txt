 In the year 2046 , a vast rail network spans the globe . A mysterious train leaves for 2046 every once in a while . Every passenger going to 2046 has the same intention : They want to recapture lost memories . Because nothing ever changes in 2046 . Nobody really knows if that 's true because nobody 's ever come back except me . 998 . 997 . If someone wants to leave 2046 ... You 're the first to come back . Some people get away fairly easily others find that it takes them much longer . I forget how long I 've been on this train . I 'm starting to feel very lonely . As I recall , many have gone to 2046 . You 're the first to come back . May I ask why you left 2046 ? Whenever anyone asked why I left 2046 I gave them some vague answer . Before that no one else would ever know . ... they 'd climb a mountain find a tree and carve a hole in it and whisper the secret into the hole then cover it over with mud . That way , nobody else would ever discover it . I once fell in love with someone . After a while , she wasn 't there . I went to 2046 . I thought she might be waiting for me there . But I couldn 't find her . I can 't stop wondering if she loved me or not . But I never found out . Maybe her answer was like a secret that no one else would ever know . ALL MEMORIES ARE TRACES OF TEARS Didn 't you promise not to come back ? I came to see you . Why ? I have no prospects here . So I 'll see how things are in Hong Kong . When are you leaving ? The boat sails in two days . Why are you telling me ? I thought we might go together . You know nothing about my past , do you ? If you 'd rather not tell me , I don 't mind . If you win , I 'll join you . She found an indirect way of rejecting me . As I recall that was the very last time we saw each other . Right after that , I left Singapore . I got back to Hong Kong at the end of 1966 . It was the time of the riots . I wasn 't sure how long I 'd be staying so I took a room in a small hotel in Wanchai . I wrote columns for newspapers . They paid HK $ 10 per thousand words . It was pretty tough at first . As long as I could make ends meet it made no difference what kind of stuff I wrote . " Diary of the Bazooka Hero . The new star at Club Luk Kwok is Fei Fei a knock-out beauty with amazing bazookas . A smash hit with tit lovers ! " Hang on . Of course I exaggerate . I can 't say her tits are fake , can I ? I soon got used to this kind of life . I became an expert ladies ' man . Lots of one-night stands . But nothing lasts forever anyway . 24 December , 1966 Is that really true ? Why would I lie to you ? You really know me ? Weren 't you in a show in Singapore in ' 64 ? Yes . You 're Lulu . I was then . Not anymore . What 's your name now ? Why should I tell you ? On Christmas Eve , 1966 she 'd apparently forgotten me . We 'd been rather close . But that night she 'd apparently forgotten me . Have we really met before ? How could you forget ? You said I looked like your late boyfriend . You taught me the cha-cha . Go on . You were always dragging me to the casino . You 'd hit a losing streak . You owed a fortune . My friends and I paid for your passage to Hong Kong . You talked a lot about your late boyfriend . A Chinese Filipino from a rich family . You planned to marry him . But he died young . You said he was the love of your life . I shouldn 't bring back sad memories at this time of year . But do you remember that Christmas night we went drinking ? We talked a lot . ... so I left quickly . I took her back to her hotel . She was dead to the world . She 'd had too much to drink so I left quickly . On my way out , I noticed a very familiar number . If I hadn 't run into her that night I wouldn 't have seen that number ... and I wouldn 't have written 2046 . Can I help you ? Is Miss Lulu in ? Lulu ? There 's no Miss Lulu here . There was a Mimi , but she moved out . But I was here two days ago . Do you know where she 's gone ? No . What do you want with her ? Nothing , really . I have her key . I wanted to return it . - You can give it to me . - Thanks . You want to rent the room ? I 'm just back from abroad . I don 't have my own place yet . If the room 's vacant , I could take a look . This is just a small hotel but our residents are all decent people . - What 's your line of work ? - I write for newspapers . Great ! A fellow artist . I haven 't always done this . I used to be an artist too . Really ? I took singing lessons , in Harbin . Back then , I was a tenor . It 'll be a pleasure to have you here . - When will you move in ? - As soon as possible . But 2046 has to be redecorated . 2047 is vacant . Take a look at it . Never mind . I 'll come back when it 's ready . Why that particular room ? Maybe it 's the number . It has some significance for you ? I 'm joking . Tell you what take a quick look at 2047 . If it 's okay , you can move in . Then switch to 2046 when it 's ready . How about it ? - Can I see the room ? - Of course . Please . Once I moved in I found out what had happened the night before . Lulu was stabbed by a jealous boyfriend . A drummer from the club . She 'd really liked him and compared him with a bird that could never land . For all these years she has been looking for her " legless bird . " Most of her affairs ended badly , but she didn 't mind sad endings . No matter what happened at least she was always the leading lady . Good . Sure . Go . Let 's go . Let 's go . I 'll go with you . Good , I 'll go with you . Sure . I understand . You know what I mean ? I know . I understand . I got it . Can I go ? I can go . Sure . I understand . Got it . It didn 't take long to finish redecorating 2046 . But by then I was used to 2047 . Sure . I started hearing a strange voice through the wall . I thought someone had moved in . But it was the daughter of the hotel owner , Mr. Wang . Please take me with you . Definitely . I 'm definitely going . Okay , let 's go . I had no idea what she was saying . The bellhop told me it was Japanese . It seems she had a Japanese boyfriend . Tell the driver 220 Granville Road . - Granville ... . - 220 Granville Road . Turn from Humphreys Avenue , near Kimberley Road . Can you say again ? - Don 't turn down Salisbury Road . - Slowly , please . - I 'll draw you a map . - That 's my pen . I 'll repeat it once more . Turn from Humphreys Avenue , near Kimberley Road . But don 't turn down Salisbury Road . Understand ? I 'll draw you a map . Granville Road . Turn from Humphreys Avenue , don 't turn down Salisbury Road . Remember , don 't turn down Salisbury Road . His company in Japan had sent him to Hong Kong . When he got here , he checked into this hotel . The world is full of men ! Why do you have to choose a Japanese ? Get rid of him ! I will never meet him ! You want my blessing ? Not while I 'm alive ! It had been going on for ages . Their family suffered under the Japanese in the war so they had to break up . Can you tell me what you feel ? Do you like me ? Or not ? I 'm scared to hear your answer . But I have to ask anyway . Leave with me . Goodbye . The man finally went back to Japan . That 's when Miss Wang began talking to herself . Hey , ask your boss to turn it down a bit ! Mr. Chow , you 'd better ask him yourself . Mr. Chow . Hasn 't he left already ? Why is he back ? I will not see him ! If you won 't give him up - Get out ! Go away with him ! I assumed that Mr. Wang played it so loud because he loved his opera . Actually , he didn 't want anyone to overhear the family row . What are you doing ? Come back for me when you 're a little older . Wait till you grow up . I like it . Mr. Wang thought about very little but his two daughters . The elder one was crazy about her Japanese man . The younger one was precocious . She always came in my room for drinks . Then she ran off with some man . Another drummer from a club band , I heard . After she left , her elder sister got into trouble too . Have a word with your boss for me . I 'm a bit late with the rent . Anyway , he has my deposit . Mr. Chow , tell him yourself . He 's in a foul mood these days . What 's eating him ? First one daughter ran away , now the other one 's in the hospital . - That 's why he 's so angry . - Why is she in the hospital ? He wouldn 't say , he was quite strange . Steer clear of him . So that 's it ? Anyhow , give him my invitation . It 's my father 's birthday banquet . He can deduct his gift from the rent I owe . On May 22 , 1967 , they imposed a curfew in Hong Kong . Home-made bombs caused panic . The economy stopped dead . I stopped going out . Some thought I was a reformed character . Actually , I was writing . A story called 2046 . All about men and women looking for love risking everything to get to a place called 2046 . What 's that ? Let 's go to 2046 . I made it bizarre and erotic , without crossing the line . The readers liked it . Some didn 't take to the science-fiction angle but all " 2046 " meant to me was the number of a hotel room . I made up the whole thing . But some of my own experiences found their way into it . People I ran into in the normal course of things turned up in my stories . I felt more and more at ease in my fictional world . Around that time . Mr. Wang 's music got louder again . More trouble with his two daughters . But also , because of the bad state of the economy lots of the rooms were empty . Then in September , the rioting ended . Life went back to normal . Soon , someone moved into 2046 . Have you nearly finished ? It 's too early in the day for that ! Some of us are trying to sleep ! Peeking ? The woman next door is quite a dish . What are my chances ? You 're off your head . A father-to-be shouldn 't have that on his mind . Now she 's pregnant , my wife won 't let me touch her . Come on , put in a word for me . Okay . How much ? How much have you got ? - Only $ 100 . - Wait for my call . Mr. Chow ! Mr. Chow ! Mr. Chow , a call for you ! Bright and early , huh ? She 's not up yet . Why come over ? I told you , it has to be arranged . She 's not some streetwalker . A fellow artist like you , show her a little respect , will you ? Yes , I 'll tell you right away . Miss Bai , your key . You 're back , Miss Bai . Who is it ? - Who are you looking for ? - Mr. Chow suggested I come by . You 're back , Mr. Chow . - Did you win on the dogs ? - I lost . I won a little . Looking for me ? I think you know this person . - What are you doing in that room ? - You said you 'd arrange it . - I paid you ! - I said that room . - I said this one . - Your girl 's in that room ! How embarrassing . Please excuse him . - I told you , the room on the left . - I said I wanted that one ! Shut up . Who is it ? Oh , you again . I just wanted to apologize for last night . Forget it . Go away . Ping , my editor , was out of line . But he 's not really so bad . Just a bit stingy . Never pays his way . Always says he 's broke when the check arrives . So I played a trick on him . At my expense ? Didn 't you go a bit far ? He only fell for it because you 're so beautiful . You 're quite a flirt . Just stating the fact . A small token of apology . Please accept it . I don 't want it . You 're still cross , aren 't you ? - Please accept it . - No . - Come on , it 's just a token - - No . Don 't make fun of me . I mean what I say ! Now , get out . That 's good . Let it all out . Slap me again if you want . Think I wouldn 't dare ? Come closer . Bastard ! Don 't be so petty . That 's enough . I 'm courteous enough not to slap you again . That doesn 't mean you can take advantage . This time , I 'll give you face . If there 's ever a next time , I 'll be less polite . It won 't happen again . My face is still numb . Accept it . They 're just a token of my regard . I chose them myself . See if you like them . If you don 't , just throw them away . Good . I 'll leave now . Calm down ! It 's none of your business who I dated last night . Who ? Dabao ? Which Dabao ? The fat one or the skinny one ? From Shanghai or from Shandong ? The trouble is I know so many men named Dabao . How should I know which one you mean ? Yes , I did . What are you going to do about it ? Fine . I 'll be waiting ! Let me just say - Get out ! You think I can accept this ? Her or me . You 'd better choose ! Now , get out ! 24 December , 1967 You 're back early . It 's Christmas . Shouldn 't you be having dinner with your boyfriend ? What boyfriend ? Then let 's have supper . Come on you have so many girlfriends . You need company ? Go out with them . They all want to be with me , but I can 't choose . The fairest thing is to see none of them . Come on , no point in staying cooped up in your room . I 'm not in a good mood tonight . I might get drunk and slap you again . That 's okay . I 'm used to it . If slapping me would make you happy , take that as my Christmas present . Come on . Come with me . Let go ! I didn 't expect to spend Christmas like this . What did you expect ? We 'd made plans . He was taking me to Singapore . He says it 's warm there at Christmas . So I didn 't even pack winter clothes . What I 'm wearing now is for summer . Have you been to Singapore ? I worked there for several years . What kind of work ? On a newspaper . Is it fun there ? It 's okay . Tell me more . I won 't be going so I 'll just have to imagine it . What do you want to know ? How 's the climate ? Pretty warm . All year round . Sometimes you can 't tell what season it is . The food stalls are great . Ping and I ate there after work . We 'd eat and drink till dawn . Our landlord was a funny man . Short and fat , and he always wore a skirt . What the Malays call a " sarong . " But when you 're away from home it sometimes gets boring . That was a dull meal . Another drink somewhere else ? You really like to drink ? It makes things easy . When I 'm drunk , I have no worries . Won 't your girlfriends be missing you tonight ? They 're not stuck to me . They see other men too . We just have fun together . They still need to make a living . I don 't get it . Where does all that fun get you ? If you find the right person , why waste time on the others ? If I find the right person ? A man like me has nothing much except free time . That 's why I need company . So people are just time-fillers to you ? I wouldn 't say that . Other people can borrow my time too . And tonight ? Are you borrowing me , or am I borrowing you ? No difference . Maybe I borrowed you earlier ... - ... and now you 're borrowing me . - Ridiculous . Don 't get me wrong . I don 't intend to take advantage of you . If that was what I wanted , I had plenty of opportunities . I just want us to be drinking pals . Is that okay ? It 's hard , but I 'll give it a try . Okay . Let 's try . - Where to ? - Let 's drink . Mr. Chow , you seem happy tonight . I certainly am , my friends are buying me dinner . This way , please . Ping ! Is it someone 's birthday ? Better than that . Chow has a new girlfriend . Definitely worth celebrating . What would you like to eat tonight ? Something expensive . - Snake ? - Yes , snake would be good . - Snake isn 't cheap . Can you afford it ? - Sure you 'll win the bet ? Shut up . Don 't mind him . - What 'll it be , Mr. Chow ? - Snake . And a lamb casserole too . And bring Hoi 's whiskey . Can 't let this go to waste . It 's delicious . Where 's your girl , Chow ? It 's already 2 a.m. Is she coming ? She can 't be coming . I don 't think she 's coming . It 's all your fault . You 're why this happened . Why blame me ? You brought this on yourself . You said she was gentle and obedient . Now we know the truth . I said she was sometimes obedient and sometimes gentle . But she 's full of surprises . That 's part of the fun . - So , what next ? - Yes , what now ? Whatever you feel like doing . And then what happened ? Tell me ! How are you going to thank me ? Pervert ! Open up ! - Who is it ? - Open the door ! It 's late . You played a fine joke on me tonight . I finished work late . Too late to get there . So I didn 't come . - What 's this ? - That 's your fault too . How could I know you 'd stand me up ? I thought I 'd win a few hundred . Instead , I lost my mustache . This is all your fault . You deserved it . Who pushed you into the bet ? I 'll tell you something . Ping asked me not to show up . Anyhow I wasn 't that fond of the mustache . You look younger now . Don 't you like it ? You 're making fun of me ! You tricked me . I 'll get you for this . How will you make it up to me ? At least give me a kiss . You bit me . Come and get me . You 're in for it when I catch you . Don 't touch me there ! Bastard . You 've bruised me . Think you were any better ? Look , I 'm bleeding . Maybe it 's because winter 's coming . See what happens when I eat lamb ? Brings out the beast in me . - What ? - Don 't move . - What are you doing ? - Shaving you . Don 't ! Who knows where that shaver 's been . It could bring me bad luck . Let 's go for round two . No way ! Why are you dressed ? I 'm going back to my room . I 'm exhausted . This is all I have , aside from loose change for the bus . Here 's $ 200 . - Please take it . - I don 't want it . I wasn 't selling . That 's not how I meant it . I want to pay for your torn dress . Please take it . I see . You 're afraid I 'll cling to you , is that it ? Fine . I 'll take $ 10 . Think of it as a discount rate . If you ever want to come over again , I 'll charge the same . I 'm going back to my room . Come here . Not tonight . Why not ? Not in the mood ? Can 't take the strain tonight . Anyhow , I 'm a bit short of cash . Never mind . You can owe me . I don 't like being in debt . The reception 's at 6 p.m. , dinner at 8 p.m. I don 't mind if you can 't make it , just send your gift . No more than you do . You hold banquets all year round . You 've had four birthdays this year . I 'll send over some more invitation cards later . Think of people with money . Write in their names and send them invitations . Mr. Chow , holding another banquet ? You know we have birthdays in different calendars ? - Another of mine 's come up . - No doubt . - Here 's one for your boss . - All right . Tell him that since we 're so close he can deduct his gift from the rent I owe . - Make sure he gets it . - Okay . It 's late . What 's so urgent ? Just got back from Macao . Chow asked me to bring you a present . You two went to Macao ? Yes . We had some days off , so we went to the casino . Oh , it 's beautiful . He says he found some money in his pocket . So before losing it all at the tables he bought you a present . Where is he ? Not back yet . You know what he 's like . Extravagant at the start of the month , and broke well before the end . He made several thousand holding that party so now he 's really enjoying himself . Is he there alone ? Of course not . There 's a gang of them . He likes company . Was he always like this ? Let 's not talk about him . Let 's have a drink . But I should warn you . I know you like Chow a lot . Don 't waste your time on him . He 's not serious . Guess who . There 's only one possibility . Let me have a bite first . What are you doing here ? What am I doing here ? What do you think ? I thought I was pretty wild . But you 're much wilder . Pay up . I haven 't seen you for ages . I 've been busy . Liar . Tell me the truth . I am . Who was that woman the other day ? What woman ? Don 't pretend . I saw her leaving your room . Who is she ? - A friend . - A friend ? What was she doing in your room ? Don 't be nosy , all right ? Go back to your room . I have work to do . I won 't . I 'm sleeping here tonight . - An overnight stay is expensive . - No problem . Name your price . I 'd pay anything to be with you . Every day . Retail is fine . Wholesale is out of the question . Why ? I just don 't like it . Could you make an exception for me ? No . You treat all women like this ? - Except one . - Who ? - My mother . - I 'm serious . I don 't mind you having other women . But I won 't be treated the same as them . I don 't care if you love me or not . I 'll love you anyway . Since we got together , I haven 't brought other men back . I hoped you 'd think the same way . - Will you promise me that ? - No . I see . Then we 're through . I 'll never bother you . And I never want you in my room again ! Here , $ 10 . Tonight , I 'm paying ! Thank you . If you 're ever in the mood , feel free to come over . I 'll charge you the same . Having fun ? What do you care ? You were rather loud last night . I meant to be . You bring back women , why shouldn 't I have men ? I want to see if you really don 't mind . I won 't go . Why don 't you come here instead . Forget it ! Don 't come ! After Bai Ling moved out , she started dating Dabao . And I saw other women too . If our paths ever crossed , we 'd pretend not to see each other . Rather pathetic , I know . But it was better for us to end it this way . I 've never seen her since . But sometimes she pops up in my stories . Your change . Please check it . Thank you . - Are you going out later ? - Why ? Could you post this letter for me ? Sure . Then Miss Wang came back . I knew from the familiar sound through the wall . Please take me with you . Good . What are you doing ? Wasn 't I clear ? Don 't contact that Japanese man ! Why are you writing to him in secret ? Aren 't you ashamed ? Return his letter ! No ? What are you reading ? A martial-arts novel . You like them ? If your friend wants to send you more letters and you don 't want your dad to know tell him to send them to my room . I 'll pass them on to you . She looked happier when she came back this time . We talked more often . Mr. Chow , another letter for you . Another . Those Japanese girls get so carried away . Let 's see each other again . Then if you still think we shouldn 't be together tell me so , frankly . That day , six years ago a rainbow appeared in my heart . It 's still there like a flame burning inside me . But what are your real feelings for me ? Are they like a rainbow after the rain ? Or did that rainbow fade away long ago ? I 'm waiting for your answer . Why do you write all that stuff about sex ? So I won 't starve . Don 't you worry about your reputation ? Maybe I 'm not such a nice guy . - Why not try writing something else ? - Who 'd read it ? How about a martial-arts novel ? People love them . That 's too hard . I tried once , co-writing it with someone . We locked ourselves away for months . Just got sore heads . Those were good times . I like writing too . It 's hard to make a living by writing . I just do it for fun . - I 'll show you some of my stuff . - Please do . Here you are , read this first . Wow , you 're prolific . When you 've read it , tell me what you think . - And don 't forget to return it . - Sure . - Have you read my story yet ? - I have . What did you think ? I think you should never write another word . Why not ? You 're so good , you could put me out of work . The Spider Sage thrusts out his fist . Two chopsticks take off like rockets . They land with explosive force . The mountain splits apart . Slow down , I can 't keep up . Come on , they 're waiting for it . All right , all right . Caught up ? Go on . Where was I ? " The mountain splits apart . " Right . The mountain splits apart smashing Iron Abacus to the ground . Iron Abacus ? Isn 't he dead ? Is he ? Then make it Iron Head . Where did Iron Head come from all of a sudden ? Hey , anything goes in martial-arts novels . Why don 't you get some rest . I 'll finish it for you . Okay . It felt like having an assistant . When I was late with my copy I asked her to ghost it for me . She was just a girl but she could write as raunchily as the best of us . We got along very well . That was my happiest summer ever . But it didn 't last . I encouraged her to face up to her father but she didn 't dare . She wanted to pay her own way so I got her a job in the cloakroom at a club . Thanks . She told her father she was going out with me . Sometimes I found an excuse to pick her up after work . - You 're here late . - If you 're ready to go I have a taxi waiting . I can give you a lift back . No , thanks . Then I won 't wait . Feelings can creep up on you unawares . I knew that , but did she ? She was always asking if there was anything at all that never changed . I could see what was on her mind . I promised to write a story for her , based on my observation . Something to show her what her boyfriend was thinking . As a joke we thought of calling it 2047 . But maybe I was being too oblique . I 'd begun to feel that it wasn 't about her boyfriend at all . Rather , it was more about me . So I began imagining myself as a Japanese man on a train for 2046 falling for an android with delayed reaction . If someone wants to leave 2046 , how long will it take ? No one can say . It 's rather boring at first , but slowly you get used to it . Others find that it takes them much longer . It takes great strength , and it can hurt terribly . I forget how long I 've been on this train . I start to feel very lonely . It 's rather boring at first , but slowly you get used to it . We have a range of cabin attendants . They can satisfy your every need . They will serve you devotedly , like an intimate friend . But you must never fall in love with them . Who 'd ever fall for an android ? Who can say ? Events can creep up on you without you ever noticing . It can happen to anyone . Paragraph 201 in the Passengers ' Guide warns that Area 1224-1225 is especially cold . The train heating won 't be strong enough . Passengers are advised to hug each other to keep warm . Since I 'm the only passenger I hug my android cabin attendant . I wonder if it 's her mechanism or just my imagination but I sense some responsive warmth in her artificial body . Why do you want to leave 2046 ? Do you know what people did in the old days when they had secrets they didn 't want to share ? They 'd climb a mountain find a tree carve a hole in it whisper the secret into the hole and cover it up with mud . That way nobody else would ever learn the secret . I 'll be your tree . Tell me , and nobody else will ever know . I always - I always - I always - Very funny . I always - I always - Whenever anyone asked why I left 2046 I gave them some vague answer . I once fell in love with someone . I couldn 't stop wondering whether she loved me or not . I found an android which looked just like her . I thought the android might give me the answer . 10 HOURS LATER I have a secret to tell you . Leave with me . I have a secret to tell you . Leave with me . I kept on asking . But she never answered . I began dreaming up excuses for her silence . Do you know the Buddhist canon ? The five decays of celestial beings ? The five decays of celestial beings . It 's all about the gods and how they go through this process too . Our cabin attendants are superbly designed . But there 's one problem . When they 've served on so many long journeys fatigue begins to set in . They might want to laugh but the smile would be slow to come . They might want to cry but the tear wouldn 't well up till the next day . This one is failing fast . I think you 'd better give up . I grew desperate . I felt like giving up . But I was soon trying again . I have a secret to tell you . Will you leave with me ? I have a secret to tell you . Will you leave with me ? Do you know what people did in the old days when they had secrets ? They 'd climb a mountain , find a tree carve a hole in it ... Whisper the secret in the hole . 990 . 991 . 992 . 993 . 994 . 995 . I slowly began to doubt myself The reason she didn 't answer was not that her reactions were delayed but simply that she didn 't love me . So at last , I got it . It 's entirely beyond my control . The only thing left for me was to give up . 24 December , 1968 Why are you inviting me to Christmas dinner ? You know how much I 'll lose in tips by not working ? Wouldn 't it be awful to be alone tonight ? I need company . That means me ? Your boyfriend hasn 't written in a while . I told him not to . Anyway , it 's hopeless . No point waiting for me . Why is it hopeless ? Go and look for him . If you don 't , it really will be hopeless . My dad will never give his consent . If you were him what would you be doing tonight ? Why don 't you ask him . Have you got his phone number ? I can 't hear you ! Can you speak louder ? I 'm already shouting ! I felt like Santa Claus that night . I took her to the newspaper office and let her make a long-distance call to her boyfriend . I was happy to see her so happy . In fact , Zone 1224-1225 meant Christmas Eve and Christmas Day . On the night before Christmas many people need more warmth than usual . That night I didn 't get that . Maybe that was for the best . 10 HOURS LATER I realized the reason the android didn 't answer had nothing to do with her mechanism wearing out nor that she didn 't like him . More likely she already loved someone else . Soon after that , she went to Japan . I gave her a copy of my story 2047 . I hope she read it . 100 HOURS LATER 1000 HOURS LATER Love is all a matter of timing . It 's no good meeting the right person too soon or too late . If I 'd lived in another time or place my story might have had a very different ending . - I have to tell you . - Yes ? I 'll be away for a couple of days . Pay my daughter this month 's rent . - She 's back ? - Not Jing Wen . I mean pay my younger girl , Jie Wen . So your worries are over . Going on holiday ? No , I have to go to Japan . But you hate the Japanese . Why go to Japan ? Jing Wen is getting married . Congratulations . I wasn 't sure whether to go or not . Now I 've decided I just want her to be happy . When do you leave ? Can you help me choose a present ? No need for that . - She wanted me to ask you something . - What is it ? She read your story 2047 . She likes it a lot . But she finds the ending too sad . She wonders if you can change it . I 'll see what I can do . AN HOUR LATER 10 HOURS LATER 100 HOURS LATER Taxi ! I 'd also like the story to have a happy ending but I let it slip away . Some years back , I had a happy ending in my grasp but I let it slip away . Don 't turn your back on me ! - Has he been here ? - What 's it to you ? While I was depressed , I ran into Lulu again . She hadn 't changed . Still intensely jealous . You think he 's yours ? I thought you knew him well . That 's the way he is ! We 've just been amusing ourselves . So control yourself , missy ! Watching her taught me something . When you don 't take no for an answer there is still a chance you 'll get what you want . 18 MONTHS LATER Hello , is Mr. Chow there ? I know I have no right to ask but they say I need a guarantor . The man who recruits girls for the nightclub says he knows you . Can you talk to him for me ? No problem . I know the man you mean . I 'll see him in a day or two . Why did you choose Singapore ? I don 't want to stay here any longer . I 've been thinking about it for some time . I want to take a look at the place . Don 't drink too much . You don 't look well . Don 't worry , it won 't kill me . You know what ? I came by here at Christmas . I thought I might run into you . Why didn 't you call me first ? I don 't know . I came on impulse . I don 't know why . That night , I suddenly missed you so much . We 're drinking pals . Of course you 'll miss me . You 're right . " We 're drinking pals . " Let 's go . - Waiter . - Yes ? - The check . - Yes . Where are you staying ? In a hotel , a rather small room . But it 's not too bad . I 'll see you back . No , thanks . I 've just moved in . It 's a mess . I 'll invite you once it 's cleaned up . I 'll go first . Seeing how much Bai Ling had changed I was suddenly overcome by a feeling of grief . Indeed , last Christmas I was not in Hong Kong . 24 December , 1969 Have you seen Miss Su ? Miss Su ? Not for some time . Any idea where she might be ? Probably back in Phnom Penh . I didn 't want to spend Christmas 1969 in Hong Kong so I visited Singapore and went back to the casino . Nobody really knew . No one knew where she was . Some thought she 'd gone back to Phnom Penh . Others thought she was dead . Ping and I began working in Singapore in 1963 . When my life lost most of its meaning I started gambling every day . Those were hard times for me . Only one person came to my rescue . A professional gambler . Some said she was a cheat . She always wore black . They called her Black Spider . She kept her black glove on for 365 days of the year . Nobody knew why for sure . Had her hand been chopped off for cheating ? Did the glove cover up a fake hand ? Nobody really knew . Why do you wear that black glove ? It 's a habit . You 're not from here ? I 'm from Phnom Penh . What a coincidence . I was just in Cambodia . It 's in chaos . Why were you there ? The newspaper sent me . You 're a journalist ? Not anymore . Why 's that ? They made some changes and I 'm now a consultant on half pay , with next to nothing to do . So why are you spending your time in the casino ? I tried to win enough to pay my way back to Hong Kong . You lost a lot ? A few thousand . You should never set foot in a casino in a bad mood . You won 't win . I didn 't expect to win . I just hoped to get back my stake . If you have any money left I can help you . On one condition : When you 've got your money back stop gambling . Why are you helping me ? I take a commission . Ten percent of whatever I win for you . Think it over . What good to her were her tiny commissions on my winnings ? After that , we went back to the casino night after night . We 'd eat at the stall next to the railway station . She won back all the money I 'd lost . Thank you . Don 't thank me , it 's yours . If you need me again tomorrow I 'll be waiting here after dinner . I still don 't know your name . It 's Su . Su Li Zhen . A few years ago , I fell in love with another man 's wife . Her name was also Su Li Zhen . It was because of her that I moved to Singapore . I never dreamed I 'd meet another Su Li Zhen . I told her a lot about the other Su Li Zhen . At first , we kept it secret . But gossip soon spread . Later , we moved into a hotel . We had room 2046 . When I think back , the whole thing was like a dream . You loved her deeply ? It 's history . Let 's change the subject . You , what did you do before ? You want to know about me ? Come on , we 'll play high-low . If you win , I 'll tell you everything . It struck me that her past was like the hand she always kept gloved . A mystery with no solution . Of all the men I 've met you 've been the best to me . I 'm already missing you . Why won 't you come with me ? Didn 't you promise not to ask ? Hold me . It may be years before we meet again . The last time we saw each other , I told her . Take care . Maybe one day you 'll escape your past . If you do , look for me . Now it strikes me that what I told her was actually meant for myself . In love , you can 't bring on a substitute . I was looking for what I 'd felt with the other Su Li Zhen . I didn 't realize that myself . But I 'm sure she did . WHEN THE PEONY BLOOMS SHE STANDS TALL AND THEN GOES AWAY . DOES SHE MEAN " NO " OR " YES " ? All for me ? You want to get me drunk ? I know you 're a good drinker . Let 's drink as much as we can . If there 's any left over finish it next time you 're here . One small thing I have to ask you . Here 's some money , please take it . What for ? I know you borrowed from a friend for my plane ticket . Pay him back . If there 's any left , pay my rent for me . Where did you get so much money ? An old customer . He 's always been fond of me . He treats me well . But he 's too old for me , so I never paid him much attention . I ran into him yesterday while I was shopping . He insisted on buying me dinner . I needed money , so I went . After dinner , I told him I needed money . He said I could have as much as I wanted . I told him I needed $ 5000 . At first , I planned to save it for Singapore . But I 'm using it now . Don 't be silly . You 're still young . You have great prospects . I borrowed the money from my friends . They don 't need it back yet . So keep this for yourself . Pay me back later . There 's no rush . Why are you so kind to me ? Perhaps it 's fate . Too bad it didn 't last . I wish it could have gone on longer . Don 't be like this . Let me buy you dinner tonight . - Waiter , the check . - Coming . No , let me . You 're too kind . You 've spent enough time and money on me already . I don 't want to owe you too much . I need to make a phone call . Please settle the check . I 'll be outside . Will you come in ? No , thanks . Get some rest . I 'll see you to the airport tomorrow . Please don 't . I 'll be terribly sad if you 're there . Take good care of yourself . Why can 't it be like it was before ? Please don 't go . Stay with me tonight . Let me borrow you . Do you remember ? You once asked me if there was anything I wouldn 't lend . I 've given it a lot of thought . And now I know there is one thing I 'll never lend to anyone . As I recall , that was the very last time we saw each other . I haven 't seen her since that night . Why can 't it be like it was before ? HE DIDN 'T TURN BACK . IT WAS AS IF HE 'D BOARDED A VERY LONG TRAIN HEADING FOR A DROWSY FUTURE THROUGH THE UNFATHOMABLE NIGHT . Everyone who goes to 2046 has the same intention : They want to recapture lost memories . Because in 2046 nothing ever changes . But nobody really knows if that 's true or not . Because nobody has ever come back .

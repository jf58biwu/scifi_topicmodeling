 Previously on Farscape . What attacked Talyn ... was a retrieval squad . my name is Xhalax Sun . You were conceived in love . The ... squad , is under the command ... of Senior Officer Xhalax Sun . My mother . My superior officers knew I visited you that night . They gave me a chance to redeem myself ... by killing your father We let her live ... she comes and she hunts us down again . Aeryn ! You should not be the one to do this . We must not let Xhalax live . You want her dead ? You do it ! As you wish . Go ... go now , you must not witness this . What ... is the matter ? Radiation . massive radiation ... I couldn 't stop it . Don 't worry about me ... I never felt better . And now ... on Farscape . I talk to the dead . I- - I can help find the dead one you seek . Pay me , pay me and I can help Aeryn . It 's your fault Aeryn 's down on Valldon ! It 's not my fault ! I 'm trying to help ! Trying to help ? She 's in mourning for Crichton ! How are you helping her by filling her head with crazy tales about ... spirit channelers ? ! It 's not crazy ! She wanted to get away from you- - she sees you following her ! I 'm following her ? You 're the one that 's following her ! Me ! Aeryn wants me around . She wants me to watch over her . She- - she wants me to protect her from people like you ! You stupid , selfish nak-noks ! Aeryn has made it clear she wants nothing to do with any of us . She wants no part of your plan to find Moya Can 't leave her on Valldon , it 's dangerous . It 's filled with mystics and criminals . Then it 's just like here . - You 're a mystic , and we 're criminals . But Aeryn doesn 't want to be here . - You don 't understand . I ... What ... is it we don 't understand , slave ? She ... she 's going to talk to Crichton . Is it you ? Yes , it 's Aeryn Sun . I 've changed my mind ... I want you to raise that man . Which one do you seek ? Talyn Lyczak , my father . My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut ... shot through a wormhole ... . In some distant part of the universe ... . I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship- - this living ship ... of escaped prisoners my friends . If you can hear me ... beware ... if I make it back ... will they follow ? If I open the door ... are you ready ? Earth is unprepared , helpless ... for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay , protect my home , not show them you exist . But then you 'll never know the wonders I 've seen You remember . Who the frell are you ? I remember it all now . What are you talking about ? Touch me . Don 't be afraid , girl . I - I ain 't gonna bite . Touch me . I remember it all . I was a pilot , Aeryn ... an astronaut . I was what I wanted to be . It 's all there . You 're all right ? Yes , I 'm fine , I 'm fine , I 'm fine . It 's just the same old pain ... same pain . It 's just the same old pain ... same pain . ... oh , I got it ... I got 'cher locket . Whose , ah ... image you got in here , anyway ? You know who 's in there . Are you Aeryn Sun ? I heard you talking to somebody ... - I thought you were alone . - I am . Now . you knew I came here searching for someone else , but ... let 's do it . Do what ? You found me , you told me ... that you could contact my dead father . So ... show me . You don 't believe I can reach him ? Look , you 're here ... I 'm willing to pay , and that is all that should concern you . Will you show me your face ? If I may ask ... what business have you with Talyn Lyczak ? I was his daughter . So ... can you contact him . I can do more than that ... I am ... Talyn Lyczak . Get away- - get back ! Stark ... Rygel , Rygel- - There ... What ? Do you see Aeryn ? No ... for a moment I thought I heard Zhaan 's voice . Oh , frelling brasma ! Tell me you 're joking , right ? ! Crais Crais Yes , Rygel . Have you located Aeryn 's signal yet ? No , she 's masked it . We 've been all over this stinking city ! Now we 're in some nakky hotel . Stark 's meeting every cousin and furbot he ever knew . It 's a planet of Stark 's down here ! You 're exaggerating . There ... there is it again ! Zhaan 's voice ! Crais ... get down here ! I can 't stand it alone with him . No , no , no . Stay with him until you find Aeryn . Comm me when you do . I talk to the dead . I- - I see . Oh , stop . Just stop . That blood 's so fake it 's laughable Kellor ... Kellor ... she misses you . Kellor ? She forgives you . She knows that you couldn 't go against your parents . How do you know her name ? She knows that a Dominar cannot just ... No ! Get away from me ! Wait ... but , I know more ... secrets ... secrets she didn 't want me to tell you . Pay me and I can tell you . Did you tell them about me ? ! Rygel , did you get touched ? I 'll touch you if you keep telling these fekiks about me ! But I didn 't . I warned you that this planet had dark powers . You 're full of yotz ! This whole place is full of yotz . Rygel , you must guard your spirit . Now ... follow me . I was told that the owner of this hotel may know where Aeryn is . I had my face altered ... so I could hide . Do you know what this is ? Early Peacekeeper standard- - blood spectrometer . Fairly primitive , yes ... but accurate to near 100 percent certainty . Compare the spectrographs . Take a hundred of mine ... and they will all match . Aeryn ... I understand . this is not what you want . Good bye ... Aeryn . Wait . Is anyone here ? I wouldn 't do that ! Back away slowly , very ... slowly ! Lucky I saw you through the peep hole and was quick enough to deactivate it . Deactivate what ? There 's nothing I can ... Protection and mutilation combined much more effective than an attack animal . Are you here to buy dead bodies ? You gotta outbid ... him He buys all his from me- - buys ' em fresh . We are not here for bodies . We are here to find a Sebacean . Named Aeryn Sun . She 's ... very beautiful hair as dark as a Fellip berry . Shut up , Stark ! She usually wears it tight , pulled back , but recently she 's taken to wearing it out , down to her shoulders . We 're close , very close . They 're not close at all ! He 's some kind of weird probakto , and she can 't stand the smell of ... That 's not true . It 's more than true ! But , we are trying to find her so we can get out of this nak house ! Hm , no ... Sebaceans here anymore . You might try the Stallic Hotel on the far side of the city I ... hear they stay there . " Far side of the city " ? I 'm not travelling tonight ! How much for your finest room ? " Finest room " ? ! Where do you think you are ? This ... is a refugee city , and you 've got to fight for tent space ! Get away ! Look at my foyer infested with cretada ! Frell off ! By the goddess , Rygel ... What is it ? It better not be Zhaan again . Don 't let her see us , don 't let her see us , oh , don 't let her see us . - Hm ? Let go of me ! - Shut up ! It can 't be her . It can 't be ... Who , Aeryn ? No , no , no , no , no . Is that ... Aeryn 's mother ? I told you to leave them alone . You were talking to that slug were you telling him about me ? I paid you a lot of money , I paid all of you a lot of money ! I would never betray you , Xhalax ! - I never would . - Not any more . Get rid of the body . By the goddess ... Crichton was right ! You never killed Xhalax ! Get him off me ! Let me up ! The only time we 're letting you up , is when we flush you out the airlock . What happened to Xhalax ? Tell us ! Let me up ! Tell us ... you tell us ! When you left me to kill Xhalax ... I saw instantly , the end . For you ! For all of us ! I knew that if I killed her , High Command would send another Retrieval Squad after us . And , if they failed ... another , and another ! You made a deal to save us all . I offered Xhalax her life . And what did you get in return ? She would inform High Command that we were all dead . Do I look like an idiot , huh ? Does he look like an idiot ? Do I look like an idiot ? Yeah- - well , I 'm not ! And we 're not fooled by you . If you 've got a deity , you 'd better make your peace with it now . Because I 'm going to lead you to the other side real quick ! - No . - No ? What ? " No . " ? Rygel understands our predicament . Talyn has part of my psyche . Can you fly him ? No , but Aeryn can . And she 's not here . Why did you come to this planet ? You said at first it was not to contact me . Who were you seeking ? I lost someone . He died . Were you in love with him ? Aeryn ... On this planet , I have seen things I never dreamed possible . At the fall of the moon , I will come back with a being who might be able to help contact the one you loved . Wait for me please . I want to try to do this for you . Here . Have you seen him before ? Yes . I 've seen him . Well , do you know who he is ? No one . Just ... I hear he 's been studying with the Nelliks ... who channel the dead . Do you know where he 's from ? I just heard he 's been hiding on Valldon for a couple of cycles , but everyone 's hiding , so ... Was he a Peacekeeper ? I don 't know . Someone could use some fellip nectar . You know where to get it . What a good idea . How can no one have seen Aeryn ? They have . They 're just not talking . Wait . I 've got an idea . Stark , what are you doing ? Leave her alone and let her die in peace . Huh ... yotz . Here we go again . Get these off me ! You 're not a child like he is . How can I help you if I 'm cuffed ? Oh , you 'll help . If someone starts shooting , you 'll make a very good shield She thinks Aeryn may be here on one of the upper levels . Right , I 'll go . I 'll stay calm . I 'll take this fekik with me . He can tell Aeryn what he did . You keep an eye out for Xhalax . Uh ! Not now ! Get away ! Right here . - This had better not be the wrong room . - It won 't be . Aeryn ? Are you in there ? Aeryn . Are you all right ? You look terrible . What have you been doing ? - Have you be- - have you been - This is serious . We need to talk . Can I come in ? All right . That does it ! Get down , on you knees ! - face the wall ! - I am not getting on my knees ! Get Down ! - You told Rygel you 'd be calm . - I am calm ! You , get down now ! Aeryn ... you must return ... to Talyn . We saw Xhalax , here on Valldon . It 's this place . You should see who I 've seen . No , no . Your mother is really , really here . No . Guess who I 've seen ? Crichton . And guess who else ? My father . Any microt now Stark , you 're going to see Zhaan . You stop . You listen to me . He ... he never killed Xhalax . He was preparing to betray us . That is not true . I made a deal for all of us . Liar Liar Now ... you must come back with us . I will look after you . I want to look after you . That would be really nice . - Oh . Please . - Don 't touch me . Aeryn . Xhalax is alive . Come on . Come on . Come on Crais , you can tell the truth . You get up ! Get away from him ! No , that 's all right . He wants me . Isn 't that right ? You always wanted to take me from Crichton and now here 's your chance . And you know what , Bialar ? If I squeeze my eyes closed ... tightly enough ... you could be someone else . No ! Come on , right here ! Right now ! Give it to me . Give me what you 've got ! You 're coming with me . I 'm taking you now ! Don 't ... you ... touch ... me ! I swear that I will spear the last eye you have left . Do you know what makes you so much worse ... is the fact that you think you 're so much better than him . Always pressing ... against me . Stealing looks ... . Get out of here . Both of you ... get out ! Uh , excuse me , uh ... have you seen a ... a cripple who was bleeding from the eyes ? He ... knew about a certain female I ... Well , don 't get excited . I just , uh ... . Peasant . - Watch out . - Hm , watch yourself . - Move . - Pushy , pushy ! Do you know who that was ? That slug was with Aeryn . He was trying to save her . How did it go ? Oh , I think Aeryn 's buying it all . When she sees this bastard ... she 'll suffer the way you want her to . Oh- - someone 's getting restless . I better get up there . You 're all set ? Under here ... solid krank . Don 't miss . I won 't First , Talyn . Then , Xhalax . What next ? Crichton Crichton Crichton That 's it ... Earth ... minus the sunshine . This is my world now . I think I liked yours better . Let me guess . You 're my long lost sister . Look , Aeryn , I know you 're upset . I too had someone important in my life . Kellor was her name . I missed her for a long time . But I knew , as I 'm sure you do , that self-sacrifice is not the answer . Look , I 'm not like Crais or Stark . I 'm not trying to save you , or recreate with you . You can do whatever you like , but ... Crichton loved you , Aeryn . He wouldn 't want his death to lead you here . Please . Could we go inside ? This height ... You 're not going in there . You have to go now . I ... should also tell you ... Crais and Stark weren 't lying . Xhalax is on this planet . And I wasn 't lying either , my father 's here too . Crazy place , Ryge . Now go . But , uh ... Go . I 've brought the seer . Seer Cresus . The one we seek is not long dead . His name ... is John Crichton . And he 's from a race called ... Human . Come here . Closer . I won 't bite ... much . Trust him . Don 't be afraid . Touch me . I must feel you , to reach him . Soft . Touch me ... soft . Tell me about this ... Crichton . Uh . He ... Did he ... love you ? Hold you ? Touch you ... soft ? Yes , he loved me . He was very ... . He made me better . Aeryn ... help me ... bring me back . Cresus ? Are you all right ? Cresus says ... he has rarely had ... a vision so powerful , and he wants me to find the Sintar . He is a creature who can ... sometimes turn ... spirits corporeal . That 's not possible . Oh , Aeryn ! On this planet , I have seen things I have not thought possible . Wait here . I will find the Sintar . If the connection is strong enough ... if he thinks this can happen ... He can bring Crichton back ? Perhaps . Don 't lose hope ... ye-yet ... Wait here . I will not be long . Just believe . I returned from the dead . Why can 't he ? This is where it hurts . Right here . You can 't bring me back , you know . Mm . They said that ... on this planet there 's a ... I 've forgotten his name . No . No ? No . Was it easy to be a hero ? Leave me behind ? You never think ... you 're gonna die . I didn 't know . You ... You did . - No . - Yes ... you did . Hello soldier ! What 's the matter ? Surprised to see your old mum ? This isn 't quite the ... family reunion you 'd imagined . Sit down . Soldier without her weapon . That 's against regulations . My leg , huh ? After you left me on that planet ... it got infected ... and I had to amputate it myself . Now that ... that hurt . You thought you could get it all . Get away ... be safe . Xhalax Hello dear . No ! Don 't ! You 've only just met , and already you 're trying to protect your father ! Xhalax , stop ! Twenty cycles ago we made a pact to survive for ... for our daughter . You couldn 't hurt her then . You couldn 't hurt me . I can hurt you now , old man . So get ready to die ! Remember when Aeryn was born ? I snuck into the med-chamber . - You had just woken ... - Lie down ! - Listen , he 's not the one that you ... - Shut up ! - Just leave him alone ! - Shut up ! Oh , go on . Shoot me . I 'm not scared of you . Shoot me , and leave Aeryn alone ! You know , I think I 've changed my mind . You 're too ugly to kill- - looking at that face . Now lie down . Lie down and roll over . Xhalax , wh-what ? Turn around- - now ! Xhalax , don 't ! Shut up ! Lie down ! Xhalax ? Roll over ! Xhalax ! Stop ! Roll over ! So ... so there 's just you ... and me . You know , things couldn 't have worked out better . I 'm glad you two got to meet . Why ? For this . For you to suffer . For everything you did . For everything that went wrong . I ... we did nothing to you . You did everything . After your birth , High Command said I could redeem myself if ... but , they lied . The damage was done . And no matter what I did , I was never ... truly ... reinstated . And now you want my pity . Oh no . I want your pain . To know how close I was ... to love . So close ... and then to lose it all in an instant . I 've heard ... loved ones leave you in pieces ... that little by little you start to forget things about them , but that 's not true . You lose them ... everything , instantly , and suddenly nothing can replace them . Nothing . And now you ... have nothing . How does it feel ? You lied to us . Said Aeryn wasn 't here ! No , no ! I-I didn 't lie ! Did Xhalax pay you to keep us away ? - Who ? I 've never heard of them . - Now , tell me again . How do you activate this security grill ? - No ! No ! Don 't touch that ! - Why ? Will those speary things shoot up ? Look ! Look ! I had to lie to you . If I 'd helped you before , that maniac upstairs would have killed me ! Go on . There ... is a service lift . Xhalax doesn 't know about it . One of you ... could go up in that . Surprise her . Stark What ? Who are they ? Down ! Uncuff me ! Uncuff me ! Under the circumstances ... uncuff him ! Wasn 't killing Talyn once enough ? But did you have to kill him in front of me ? Is that what was missing ? When I first met him , I knew he wasn 't my father , but he knew all these details about you and me . You 're lying . You didn 't know . Of course , I hoped ... that he might be Talyn . Just as I 'd hoped that I might see Crichton again but in my heart ... I knew that that was not my father . And then you walked in . You know , we Peacekeepers think that we are so remarkable . Soldiers without ... equal . Precise tacticians . Pure bloods . But , I 've realized , we 're not remarkable . We do nothing for love . Not one thing . You 're wrong . Cycles ago , after your birth , I was given an order . They called it a choice . " One of you must die " , they said . I killed your father so you could live . I did that ... for love . Stark . It 's here again . Zhaan 's voice . Can you hear it ? Not now , Stark . Stark ! Get down ! Save Aeryn ! I 'll hold them off here . Go ! Go ! So . This is it ? Kill me now . Destroy the last piece of your life ... and leave nothing . I wasn 't an assassin until I killed your father . I was a pilot ... I was bred to be a pilot . But they made me kill again , and again . And finally I stopped caring . But I knew your suffering would ease my pain . And it has . It has . The battle 's over , Xhalax . - You don 't want to kill me . - No ? Why don 't you come out here , a bit closer ? It might make it easier for you . Here . You can 't miss from here ... Unless you want to . Drop the gun , Xhalax . - Aeryn ! - No ! No ! Let me fall , Aeryn . Do it . Let me go . I died a long time ago . You live for me . Zhaan 's voice keeps getting stronger . I know she 's trying to reach me and I must discover what she needs to communicate . Please do not waste time trying to look for me . It is vital you take what I have left you to the Crichton on Moya . He , and only he , will know what to do with it . Good-bye my friends . Take care of Aeryn . I will find you again . Crais ? Why would Stark leave this ? What d 'you think the other Crichton wants with it ? I have no idea . Talyn believes he 's located Moya . His long-range scans have detected Leviathan transmissions from the ... Manin Nebula . Well , let 's try to find them . It 'll be good to get back to Moya . perhaps . As soon as our ships are reunited , and ... Talyn can find someone other than me to pilot him , I shall leave . I , ah ... hope Moya 's done better than we have . Is Aeryn on her way up ? She 'll be leaving Valldon within the arn . Maybe ... I could have become something different . If you 'd lived , I could have truly changed . But you are gone . And I am what I was bred to be . Aeryn ... . No . You have to go now . Wait ! Most of the time , Aeryn , what we do is a distortion ... a hoax . But , with you , Aeryn Sun , it may ... have been ... Real . Shall we try ? One ... more ... time ? SUBTITLES By Slay and Pcosmos

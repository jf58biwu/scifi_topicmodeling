 ( Men laughing ) ( Whistling ) ( Man laughs ) ( Man ) Oh ! It 's a great rec room , man . ( 2nd man ) I 'm moving in ! Squatters . They 've probably moved on . Months ago , I guess . Should we let the demolition crew know ? Save a bunch of derelicts living off the fat of society ? Sure , Mother Teresa . By law , they check a building once an hour for six hours before it 's torn down . So I can assume we 're the only ones left here . It 's kind of strange when you think about it . - What is ? - This building 's been here 40 years , it 's produced things , it 's housed people ... What ? I 'm serious . Next month there 's going to be people standing here ordering nonfat lattes , not even knowing this place existed . - That 's deep . - Want me to get your medication ? ( Laughter ) What I 'm saying is , it just makes me curious , that 's all . - About what ? - The test of time ... - ( Man laughs ) - How we 're gonna make our mark on life . I know where we can start . - Where ? - The basement . We shut down that power coupler and the first round at McGinley 's is on me . - All right . - That was beautiful . You move me . ( Laughter ) Ow . Watch your head . We won 't find this thing . Why can 't we just cut the power at the grid ? Something about reverse current spikes . HQ thinks there might be an illegal line running in from one of these buildings . An alternate power source . Still active 15 years after the building 's been abandoned ? - That 's what we 're here to find out . - ( Man ) Come check this out . ( Loud clunk ) What the hell is that ? Well , Junior , they look like doors to me . I can see that , jackass , what are they doing here ? - I didn 't see any more rooms on the plans . - There weren 't any . Specs listed this room at 40 feet , I counted 37 . See ? The powers of deductive reasoning at work . - You paying attention , Ray ? - So what ? It 's just a closet . - How do you know that ? - There 's only three feet on the other side . Yeah , thank you . - But it opens inward . - What 's the difference ? It 's locked . - Wow . - Well , boss , what do you think it is ? I don 't know , but ... just don 't touch anything , all right ? Why not ? Nothing 's been in here for years . There 's still an energy leak here and I 'll bet it 's coming from someplace in this room . I 'll take that bet . Think there 's anything in here that 's worth something ? - I don 't know , Ray . - Call Geraldo and find out . Guys . Think I found something . What is it ? I 'm not sure but check out the wiring . You see how these terminal cables run from here right around back to those monitors back there ? They 're power cables . Check it out , Shelly . - Guess we found the leak . - Is it self-contained ? Looks like it . I don 't know where it 's coming from , though . Uh-oh . Guys ? No way . There 's no way they have their own nuke core . Nobody can build a reactor that small , no way . No , that 's not completely true , Dean . In the 1960s Popular Mechanics broke a story about a portable nuclear generator . It was supposedly covered up but it 's possible . We should leave . Let 's get Headquarters down here to handle this . ( Beeping ) ( Alarm sounding ) - What did you do ? - I don 't know ... I told you not to touch anything . - I , er ... - Turn it off ! Don 't move ! Don 't move ! Don 't move ! All right , look , this place is hot . We 'll get out of this room , call Headquarters - and they 'll call NEST , all right ? - OK . Wait , we can 't just leave this here . - Don 't touch it . - This must be worth a lot of ... No ! Where are we ? What the hell was that ? How 'd we get out here ? Why don 't you wait for the guys ? I 'm gonna go look around . Yeah . OK . You 're the boss . I 'll just , er ... Oh ... - Come on ! - Give me a minute . I can 't understand half of this . It 's all quantum mechanics . This is way beyond me . This is like Stephen Hawking , NASA ... - Do you know what it is or not ? - N ... - I don 't know if you 'd even believe me . - Try me . OK , Ray , it 's ... - It appears to be some kind of portal . - Portal ? Like a door ? - Yes , Ray , just like a door . - A door to what ? I don 't know , it 's ... - It 's what ? - Like ... I don 't know . The way I read it , a parallel dimension . What ? Are you out of your friggin ' mind ? This journal documents their progress and then it just stops short of saying whether or not they succeeded . - What does that mean ? - I don 't know ! It ends . The writer just stops . They don 't say whether or not they succeeded . So where does that leave us ? - What are you doing ? - Leaving a note . - For what ? - In case we don 't come back . ( Both grunt ) You OK ? - You all right ? - I 'm a little dizzy . Dizzy 's better than dead . I can tell you that right now . Yeah , it is , Ray . ( Wind whistling ) Where are they ? No idea . It 's so dark . What was it , noon when we left ? Yeah . Weird . Yeah , weird . - The portal 's still open . - Good . - It 's like another Chicago . - What ? This is nuts . HAA ! - Jeez ! - Oh , that 's funny . - That 's all I needed . - Where the hell are we , funnyman ? - My heart stopped . Where 's Dean ? - He 's fine , he 'll be back . - Come check this out . - What ? I don 't know . ( Laughs ) Come on . ( Both sigh ) OK , OK . Where are you taking us , to Barbados ? Check it out . ( Laughs ) Open it up . Please , please , please , please , please . Oh , my God ! - Is it real ? - It 's real ! - We are rich ! - Oh , my God ! - Oh , my goodness ! - Don 't throw it away ! - Oh , my God . Look in the bags . - We 're rich ! Slap me right me now , slap me . - Slap me again . Am I dreaming ? - No ! We 're rich ! We 're rich ! ( All shouting ) We 're rich ! ( All shriek and laugh ) I 'm gonna get a car ! Get over here ! Check this out ! - We 've got to get out of here . - We 're rich ! - We 've got to leave now . - Leave ? Look at the money ! - Put it down , we gotta leave . - ( Man ) Guys . ( Squelching ) ( Chattering hiss ) - ( Crunch ) - ( Screams ) Run , run , run ! ( Squelching ) ( Chattering hiss ) ( Squeals ) ( Creature squeals ) ( Metallic slash , squealing ) ( Man ) Split up . Meet you back at the house . ( Squeals ) Follow me . - We wait here . - What about Junior ? - He 's dead . - Be glad they didn 't turn him . - What ? What do you mean , " turn " ? - Quiet . Hey , who are you ? - Dean , we should run for the portal . - Shut up . You go there , you 're dead , all right ? Shut up . We gotta do something . - Dean , I wanna leave . - Quiet . You 'll draw attention to us . - I wanna leave now . - I heard you . - But ... - Shut up ! They pick up vibrations . They find you , they find us . - Where are we ? And what 's going on ? - You be quiet . - I 'm outta here . - Ray ! ( Whoosh ) ( Shrieks ) ( Squealing ) ( Squeals ) We 've got to get out of here . Now ! ( Woman screams ) ( Screams ) ( Crunching ) Go , go ! ( Chattering hiss ) Go ! Go ! Go ! ( Squealing ) Go ! - Where 's Dean ? - I don 't know . - Where 's the light ? - The power 's blown out . - Dean was in there . - I know . - He 's still in there ! - I know he is ! Oh , God . Who do we call ? The National Guard ? The NSA ? The CIA ? Who deals with this kind of thing ? I don 't know . But we have to call someone , I think . Did you see that thing ? It ripped his heart out . I saw that . All right , look . I 'm gonna go call someone , OK ? You stay here and you see if you can get that thing back open , all right ? - Hey , Ray . - Yeah . - You think Dean 's still alive , right ? - He has to be . OK . Cos we just kind of left him there , Ray . He was right behind us , Shel . - We didn 't leave him . - OK . - You gonna be all right ? - Um ... - Uh , yeah . - You gonna be all right by yourself ? Yeah . Yeah . - All right . - I 'm OK . Just not sure I can say the same about Dean . - Hey , wait . - What ? Where are you from ? You saw the marking , right ? Tell me where I am . - What 's the call ? - Bring him in . Let 's go . We wait here . Crane 's coming . Who 's Crane ? - Who 's the stranger ? - Crane , he has the mark on his shoulder . We found him down near the district . - There were four of them . - He 's a liability . Look . Look ! - The old man will want to see him . - What if he turns us over to the queen ? He has the mark . This could be it . We 're taking him to the old man . Alive . If he betrays us , it 's on your head . He goes in blindfolded or not at all . If I was gonna hurt you , I would have done it already . Look , where are we going ? And ... And who 's the old man ? And what were those things out there ? - What 's your name ? - Dean . Listen , Dean , if you are who I think you are , we 've been waiting for you for a long time . Come with us or stay here . But you 've seen what you 're up against . There 's no more time . Trust me . Hey . Where is everyone , where are the cops ? Out on the street , eating donuts , ready to lock me up . - Did you call anyone ? - They didn 't believe me . I called the cops , the Feds , the fire department . They thought I was nuts . Said they 'd only send a paddy wagon . - They didn 't believe you ? - Right . OK , OK . Think about it . A portal to an alternate universe ? Do you blame them ? What 's in the bag ? That 's the good news . - On the way back , I made a little pit stop . - No , no , no , no . - Two shotguns , two handguns ... - They sold you that over the counter ? This is America , where anybody with a driver 's licence and a little cash can pick up an arsenal in his lunch hour . - Did you get that thing back open ? - No . - Why not ? - I just didn 't , but I know where the short is . Hurry up , we 're the only chance Dean has . They 're leaving . Let 's go . May I ? Yes . You see , they don 't have tattoos in this world . That 's how they knew you were from mine . I 'm Dr Richard Morelli . - I 'm so happy to see you . - Then you 'll understand why I don 't have any idea what 's going on . I mean , where am I ? Who are these people ? - And what happened to Chicago ? - This is Chicago . Only not the one that you know . In fact , this entire planet is Earth but not the Earth you and I were born to . I 'm assuming that you stumbled upon a portal in the old Mayweather Building ? We work for the electric company and er ... we were sent down to shut down the power . Electrician ? Electricians . - ( People whispering ) - Electricians ! This is more than we could have hoped for . Tell me , what happened to the machine ? How did it switch off ? How did you fix it ? I have no idea what you 're talking about . We found a black box . Listen , are you really trying to tell me I 've stepped into a parallel universe ? Just as I did , 30 years ago . - Please , try to remember . - Shelly found your machine , fiddled with some wires and I guess he turned it on . Shelly ? Is she here ? She 's a he . Sheldon . He went back with Ray . You know where the portal is . Can you get all of us through ? It closed . I was afraid of that . Look , this all seems like a real bad , bad nightmare . And I can 't wake up . You didn 't see what happened to Junior . You didn 't . This can 't be happening . Come with me . I invented the machine 30 years ago . I was young and idealistic . I had no idea I would be trapped here for 30 years . If it was man-made , why can 't you build another portal ? Oh , I have tried . But it 's too complicated to build from memory . I had a journal with all my notes but I didn 't think to bring it with me when we crossed over . I came to learn that portals don 't open necessarily alone . By creating this rift in the fabric of time I allowed another rift to be opened and that other one allowed a darkness to enter . - The spider freaks . - We don 't know how many came in . But the world couldn 't stop them and before they could muster a defence it was too late . It 's like this everywhere ? At first , there were breakouts all across the country . Over the last ten years we 've had to cut contact with the others - for our own safety . If the others know where we are , so will she . - She ? - The queen . A queen of horrendous power . She enslaves and consumes . She 's very well protected by soldiers only she can create . If she is eliminated , the soldiers will quickly die off . Our only chance is to kill her . - Has anyone ever tried to kill the queen ? - Yes . At first there were dozens of them . It was horrible but there was hope . The queens invaded the cities but the people were armed . - How could they take over ? - Time . The queens could recruit soldiers faster than the people could replenish the supplies . Then the ammunition just ran out . I saw her . Sometimes I think she 's just waiting for me to build that portal . I know it sounds absurd but she 's running out of food here . Do you think your friends could reopen the portal ? Sure , they probably have half the US military helping them . Military ? Yes , we 're going to need the military . You do realise that I cannot guarantee that the portal will stay long enough for all of us to cross over ? - Why not ? - It 's too volatile . How do you think we are both stranded here ? Sometimes it can be open for as long as 30 minutes , other times just a few seconds . Plus , we risk the spider queen getting there before us . Why doesn 't somebody ... camp outside the opening of the portal ? No , not you . - I 'll send one of the others . - Why ? They 'll be looking for me . These people need you as much as I do . I was their only hope . Until now . What do I do till then ? Stay with Elena . She knows the rules . - What rules ? - The rules that keep us all alive . To hunt for food and remember that we too are hunted . You will be provided with weapons . Stay safe . ( Sheldon ) All right . All right . Right , come on . Come on . That 's it . Up . - Keep going , keep going . - OK , OK . Don 't give up . Yeah , yeah , yeah , that 's it . - Try it again , you 're almost there . - Here we go . Come on , baby . Come on , baby . ( Laughs ) - That 's it ! - You can hold it . It 's gonna work . ( Metallic scraping ) ( Grinding ) I don 't trust him . Why ? He could save us . He 's dangerous . He threatens everything we 've worked for . He was smart enough to get here . And brave enough not to go with his friends when he had a chance . Are you sure it was bravery and not stupidity ? What if he exposes us ? They know he 's here . They saw him , and the rift . Listen . Because of me you 've lived in fear for too long . This may be our only chance . Keep him safe . Do you remember what it was like before ? Not much . How many people are left ? Not many . We had to split into groups . Because when the queen recruits a man , he leads her directly back to his group of survivors . The less we know about each other the better . I still can 't believe any of this . You 'd better . Cos we 're counting on you to get us out of this . You must be very strong . I don 't know how else to be . Tell me about the soldiers . What are they ? They 're people like us . Only changed . Infected with her venom , they become her slaves . They don 't live long so she 's always recruiting . They 're a lot stronger than us . The only way to stop them is to kill them . Let 's go . Go check the Banning Building . OK , let 's move . Another group of survivors . - They 've left everything . - Soldiers found them ? Maybe . It 's not a secure spot like we have . It 's a basement , what makes it so secure ? We 're so far underground it 's hard for them to smell or hear us . We 've got to find her before she finds the old man . They 're all dead here . - Move it . - Why don 't you lay off ? All I want to do is get the hell home . Just remember you 're supposed to save us . Move it . ( Chattering hiss ) ( Squelching ) ( Distant gunfire ) What the hell was that ? They 're here and they must have brought the army . - Come on . - ( Gunfire continues ) Dean ! Where 's the army ? - Where 's the portal ? - It 's closed . Go ! Go ! Go ! ( Chattering hiss ) Come on , I think we 've lost them . ( Crash ) - I 'm out . - I got it . - How do you work this ? - Give it to me . - What ? - Why didn 't you call for help ? It 's good to see you alive , Dean . They didn 't believe us . They thought it was a hoax . - One of you should 've stayed behind . - We didn 't know it would close behind us . We were worried about saving your ass . My ass just wants to get home . Calm down , we did our best . - I appreciate that but if we don 't ... - ( Footsteps ) The old man wants to see you . Remarkable . So it was a short that caused the portal to close ? I replaced some breakers that were installed to prevent spikes from the core . - I see . - We must be able to think of something . Well , where do you think you went wrong ? Who 's to say ? Six of the world 's greatest minds collaborated on the project . Even if I was able to reproduce the quantum aspects , I still couldn 't build the machine myself . - You 're talking to three electricians . - That 's right . - We can do this . - Totally . Look , I am halfway through the logic of the physics . It took me years to collect the data I needed . That research is based on work that was never done here . It 's all left behind , in your world . You mean this research ? I don 't know , it 's ... it 's sketchy . There 's hope but it 's slim . The fact is , the materials that they 've scavenged here are not as sophisticated as the real McCoy and er ... - I 'll do my best , but I don 't know . - All right . Can I talk to you for a minute ? Let 's say they get it working . What do we do about the money ? - What money ? - What money ? The money lying beside the truck . There 's got to be over a million bucks there , at least . We 're fighting for our lives here , Ray . And you 're willing to risk it all for a couple of bucks ? All I 'm saying is , we 're over here , we might as well take advantage ... I 'm gonna forget we ever had this conversation . I 'm just gonna forget it . ( Dean ) So ... is this what you do for fun ? Lookout detail ? Take a look . Sometimes I look out there and I imagine what it would have been like to live in this world when it was ... alive . Everybody going places and ... and meeting people . Having dinner , laughing . What 's your world like ? Lt ... it has troubles . Not like yours but troubles all the same . - Isn 't there anything good ? - There 's a lot of things good . There 's , like , you know , birthday parties and cool jazz and cold beer and there 's hot pizza . - Hot food . - Hot food . Food 's ready . And it 's not hot . ( Electronic noises ) It 's working . ( Laughs ) It 's working ! You OK ? ( Panting ) Thank you . We shouldn 't take a break just yet . Your colleague 's confidence in me is perhaps more than I deserve . He does that . But if you don 't eat , you 're not gonna do us any good . So eat . Um ... do I want to know what this is ? Did you cook it ? Is it even cooked ? We can 't cook because of smell . They 'd know where we were right away . How do you think we 've hidden here so long ? What happens if we get the portal up and running and the queen finds it ? One thing we should all be agreed on - it must end here . If she gains access to another world , her appetite will only continue to grow . Whatever holocaust I 've caused cannot be allowed to spread . We won 't let that happen . We won 't . So what happens if you 're bitten by this spider queen ? Yo . It depends . If you 're a woman , you 're food . If you 're a man , they either kill you or turn you . Guess that makes you pretty safe . So what 's with the turning , what exactly does that mean ? You mutate into one of her army , you become powerless to do anything but what she wants . Been there before . You can feel it destroy you from the inside out . ( Footsteps ) Crane . - We got soldiers in the building . - How many ? - I counted two . - Get ready . - Are we leaving ? - It could be a random search . - On the third floor . - Got it . - You stay . - You need help . For all I know you led them here . You stay . We 're going back to work ? If we leave our equipment , we 've lost everything . Are you coming ? All right ! You know the drill , everyone stay hidden . We don 't want them to know we 're here . And no gunfire ! Jones , get an accurate count . This place is safe , my ass ! - You ready for this ? - No . So has this ever happened before ? Occasionally . We should have left here a week ago but we haven 't seen any soldiers here so we got comfortable . We should hope that this is just a scouting party , right ? If it 's not , this is the only way out . It 's more than a search party . If she knew we were here , she 'd have sent the entire army . You ready ? Where do you want us ? I want you to stay here . Stay hidden . And no gunfire , not when we don 't know how many are out there . If they make it this far , kill them . - Where are you going ? - To find them first . Be careful . Come on . Ray . The candle . ( Hissing growl ) ( Footsteps on stairs ) Whoa , whoa , whoa . I spotted two more . I 'm joining the others . - Stay and protect the doc . - All right . Come on . You ready for this ? Yeah . All right , I don 't care what those people say , if any of those things come here , shoot ' em . - All right ? - Gotcha . All right . ( Metal clanking ) ( Sheldon breathing heavily ) ( Chattering hiss ) ( Creaking ) ( Creaking ) Go . ( Hissing ) ( Gasps ) We have to get to him before he finds the others . You take the end stairs , I 'm gonna follow him down . Dean , wait . Damn . ( Grunts and coughs ) ( Screams ) You looking for trouble ? You 've come to the right place . ( Chattering hiss ) ( Squelching ) ( Squeals ) ( Chattering hiss ) ( Groans ) ( Shouts incoherently ) ( Chattering hiss ) ( Slicing crunch ) ( Squealing ) No . Jones is dead . - Do they know we 're here ? - No . So keep the gun in your pants . You know , " thank you " would have been enough . Hey . You take the front , we 'll take the back . ( Door squeaks ) It 's all right , it 's Ray , it 's just me . ( Chattering hiss ) ( Knocking ) ( Squeals ) When I tell you to stay put , you stay put . Let go of him . Let go of him . ( Knocking and creaking ) - Morelli . - No , not him . ( Ray ) Dean ! Hey , Ray ! Dean ! They took ' em . They took ' em both . ( Groans ) Don 't you understand ? It was a trap . Nothing I could do , there were too many of them . I 'm not blaming you . I 'm just glad you 're all right . But we gotta find those people . It 's impossible . We don 't even know where her lair is . Those people are the only hope we have of getting out of here . You don 't understand , they 're probably already dead . Or worse . - I gotta find ' em . - If you wanna throw your life away , that 's your business but don 't expect us to go with you . And what are you gonna do ? Pack up and find another place to hide ? - That 's how we 've survived this long . - That 's not survival , pal . Your numbers are dwindling fast . Soon you won 't have any choices . So if you 're gonna make a stand , do it now . - Crane . - No , Elena . We live our lives as we always have - by our rules . - The rules keep us alive . - And the old man ? He 'd expect us to do the right thing , which is to pack up and move on . - And I 'm not your pal . - No , you 're a coward . - Stop it ! - Break it up . - Easy ! - We don 't need this . Stop it ! Stop it ! And what are you ? Your people opened the portal , they let them through ! And I can 't change that ! And what ? Everything 's OK if we go through with you ? No . But we can go kill the queen , and give other survivors a life again here ! Look , I 'll make a deal with you . You bring back Shelly and the doc , have ' em open that portal , and I 'll stay here as long as I have to to bring that bitch down . Then it 's up to you - you can stay or you can go . OK . Look , there 's one problem . We still don 't know where her lair is . I do . I know where she is . You know ? You know where her lair is and you never said anything ? We both know they 'd all go after her , and they 'd either be slaughtered or turned and they 'd come after us . Look , if you know where she is then why don 't you lead us there ? The queen 's nest is here , in the old Strathum Building . - The perimeter 's guarded by soldiers . - And the structure itself ? We 'll go through the adjoining building . It 'll give us access to the fourth floor . - Why there ? - That 's where the queen lives . - Won 't there be soldiers inside ? - Her Majesty likes her privacy . - What about soldiers on the roof ? - No . Not that I 've seen . All right , good . Come on . Either of you ever fired a shotgun ? Hmm ? It 's simple . You put the shell in here , give it a pump , pull the trigger , you 're in business . Who wants one ? And right here , same principle . You put a clip here in the butt , you rack it , you load it , and it 's ready to go . Be careful , it 's loud . You understand we go in silent ? Yeah . No guns unless necessary , I got it . Let 's go . How you doing , partner ? Been better . Don 't worry about it . We 're gonna get Morelli back , then we 'll all get out of here . Damn straight , cos I 'm coming with you . Sorry , pal , you can 't . You 'll slow us down . We don 't have that much time . Why don 't you stay here and make this place a little safer ? Do I have a choice ? No . Sorry about Shel . I mean , I should 've put up a better fight or something , I don 't know . Don 't worry about it . I wouldn 't have any friends left . We 're gonna get out of this place one way or another , I promise you that . And you still owe me 50 bucks for that Dallas bet . - All right ? - All right . We wait for nightfall . Our best bet is to split up . Keep your eyes open . That way . Oh , my God . Dr Morelli ? Dr Morelli . - You OK ? - Yes , I ... I 'm fine . I 'm just ... Morelli . - This is Crane . - I 'm just thirsty . We have to get out of here before she comes back . - Where 's Sheldon ? - ( Sheldon ) Dean , I 'm here . ( Grunts ) Hey , buddy , I knew you were still alive . She knows about the portal . You talked to her ? She wants to open it to use it to get to our world . - Can you get me up ? - Come on . - We gotta ... We gotta destroy the portal . - It 's OK . Dean . ( Scraping ) He 's bitten . ( Groans ) - I 'm sorry . - No , don 't be sorry . The portal just needs one more conduit . You gotta go back and destroy the machine on our side . ( Chattering hiss ) Let 's move ! Give me the gun , I 'm gonna kill that bitch ! - I 'm dead , Dean . - Sheldon , give me the gun ! - Let 's go ! - We have to go . Go , Dean . ( Chattering hiss ) ( Screams ) ( Squeals ) We gotta get out of here ! Let 's go ! - Come on , this way ! - Go ! Go ! ( Banging ) Whoa ! Come on , let 's go , quick ! Come on ! Let 's go ! ( Chattering hiss ) ( Hisses ) Oh , God . I made some traps at the safe house . - What kind of traps ? - You 'll see . Look , we gotta keep those things away from us while we hook up a conduit for the portal . We move now . Let 's go . Go . Where 's Ray ? Hey , Ray ! Dean ! - Come on ! - I got it ! - Put it down and come on ! - Man , I got the money ! Ray ! - ( Screams ) - No ! Ray ! - Come on ! - Ray ! Ray ! Where are you going ? To continue working on the machine . Why ? I would like to see you go home . You would ? He said he wants to see you go home . They 're coming . Yeah . Ray made some traps . He sure did . We got a lot of work to do . Crane . You have something to say ? I want them to go . - Who ? - Elena . And the others . I want them to have a chance at a normal life . And you ? I 'm gonna stay here and try and find other survivors . If you can make the portal work , we 'll all have a chance . You can do it , can 't you ? Make the machine work ? I will if you stop bothering me . David . Take care . Hey . If I make it to your world , I 'm gonna be alone . You won 't be alone . I promise you won 't be alone . Let 's go . Look . - There 's only one . - There 's gonna be others . - He 's coming for the front door . - Crane 'll get him . - Wait . - What ? What , Dean ? What ? It 's Sheldon . Dean , wait ! ( Crash ) They 're coming ! Go ! Go ! Go ! ( Chattering hiss ) - Split up . - Keep ' em out of the north stairwell . ( Electricity buzzing ) ( Hissing ) ( Roars ) No . No . Come on , burn ! ( Screams ) ( Groans ) ( Screams ) ( Squealing ) ( Squelching ) ( Hissing ) ( Squealing ) Come on . Get out of the way ! Come on ! Wait . Give me the gun . I 'm gonna take care of this . Give me the gun ! - Crane ... - Take care of Morelli . Come on . Good . Hold this . This is A , this is B , I 'll give you the numbers . ( Chattering hiss ) All right . I need red on white , blue on ... brown . ( Hissing ) Time to play , freaks . ( Squelch ) ( Crane groaning ) ( Chokes and growls ) ( Growls angrily ) Point A to three . - B to eight . - To eight . What happened ? ( Chattering hiss ) Shelly . It 's me , Shelly . It 's me . It 's me . ( Slashing ) ( Chattering hiss ) I don 't have backup . Dean ! ( Squeals ) ( Squealing ) Try a power reading on that one for ten . Move it back , and this one on five . - What are you doing ? - You can 't protect me forever . - We need you . - No , you need time . - What if we get it working ? - You 'll go through .

 Futurama [ 5x10 ] - The Farnsworth Paradox - CiWaN Oh , Lordy Lou ! Help ! I know you 've rejected me a lot before , but frankly ... I wasn 't sure we were right for each other either . But now I am ! So how about a date tonight ? Sorry ! I think I ... I think I left my toaster on . Buddha ! Zeus ! God ! One of you guys , do something ! Come on , Leela . What 's the real reason you won 't go out with me ? Help , Satan ! You owe me ! Look , I 'm embarrassed to admit this , but you 've forced me to . I can 't go out tonight Because I have sweaty boot rash ! No spluh . Why do you think I 'm sitting over here in the stink-Free zone ? So will you go out with me ? Good news , everyone ! I 'm still technically alive , yes . But I need you to dispose of this crazy-Ass experiment ... That almost killed me . You 'll have to throw it into the sun itself . For only the thermal nuclear inferno of the sun ... Has enough energy to ensure its total destruction . I could hit it with a shovel . That 's not good enough . This one time I pounded a guy into the ground like a stake with a shovel . Yes , yes . So , what 's in the box already ? No peeking ! Ow ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! I don 't know what 's in there . But I 'm sure our minds would be unable to comprehend it . Ow ! You hurt my collator ! I don 't care . Listen well . No matter what happens ... No matter how great your curiosity , you are forbidden to look in this box . Forbidden ! Pretty tantalizing , though . Whatever 's in there , it 's the only thing I 've ever wanted . In my experience boxes are usually empty ... Or maybe with a little cheese stuck to the top . And one time , pepperoni . What a day that was ! Give me the box ! Scram , you lousy green snakes ! Here , Leela . Take this and use it to shoot those guys . Right . If they try to look in the box . Whatever . Let 's just forget about the box . The professor said to stay away . Fry , how can you be so naive ? He was joking , get it ? No . That 's what makes it so funny ! Okay , he wasn 't joking . Now shut up and follow me . Ow ! It 's hot ! The butter in my pocket is melting ! Yep . We thank you , Bender , for the gift we are about to receive . Tangled-Up Christmas lights ! We can take shifts untangling them ! And unlabeled booze ! Wide-Mouth too ! That ought to keep those dopes occupied . I can guard the real box in peace now that no one 's curious about it . Well , I got through the night , and no one looked in the box . Not even me . The person who gave up her whole evening to watch it . A whole evening of TV , gone ! What a mockery of justice That I can 't take even a little tiny peek . I need coffee . Okay , heads I look , tails I don 't . Oh , yeah . Oh , yeah ! Heads ! I mean , all right , then . No . I have a duty not to look . Well , then again , I promised the coin I would . Oh , it 's deep . Deeper than a small box should be . Ouch ! My lawyer will hear about this ! What have you done ? Nothing ! What do you mean , why was I looking in the box ? I meant your hair . It 's all different-Y . Bender ? Ls- - ? Is that you ? You know it . Large and in charge . Leela ? Oh , there 's a woman for you . Always dyeing her hair instead of not looking in a box . I didn 't dye my hair . This is how I always look . No , that 's how you always look . This throws my entire perception of reality into question . Clone ? Robot ? Or long-Lost twin ? Taking all bets ! I also offer video poker ! It 's some guy wearing a Leela costume ! Get him ! Hold it ! You have this all wrong ! I just fell into the box and then I fell out somehow . You shut up , sir ! No , wait ! I 've got it ! I know what 's in the box ! Oh , I 've been as dumb as Fry . Am not ! It contains a parallel universe ! And when you create a parallel universe ... It 's almost always populated by evil twins . Now look , I am not evil . My loan officer said so . Oh , you 'd like us to believe that wouldn 't you , Leela ? Or should I say , " Evilla " ? This is awful ! Somewhere , there 's a more evil Bender than me ! I do my best , damn it ! Leela ? The good Leela . I want you to snoop around the other universe ... And find out how evil they are . Here . I tell you , they 're not evil . But don 't be confused . They are jerks . Hello . Ow ! Come out of your universe with your hands up ! Oh , wow ! It 's like that drug trip I saw in that movie ... When I was on that drug trip . Astonishing ! I must have created a parallel universe . Baldercrap ! I created your universe ! All you created was my fist parallel to your face ! Ow . It doesn 't matter who created what . The important thing is- - We 're exactly the same . I know all her moves . Therefore , I 've got the upper hand . Now , now , perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything . Let 's recap what 's happened so far . As you can see , I accidentally created a box containing your universe . While I , in a simultaneous blunder , created a box containing your universe . This is getting confusing . Why don 't we call our universe " Universe A " And this universe " Universe B. " Hey ! Why can 't we be Universe A ? We want A ! It 's the best letter ! We called it first . Besides , this place kind of feels like a B , you know ? All right , you can be crummy Universe A. And we 'll be Universe One . Or the Mongooses . That 's a cool team name . " The Fighting Mongooses . " Wait a second ! If everyone is identical ... Why did our Leela look into the box and your Leela didn 't ? Well , to be honest , I tossed a coin . It came up tails , so I didn 't look . That 's weird . Mine came up heads , so I did . Interesting . Apparently the key difference between our universes ... Is that coin flips have opposite outcomes . That explains fruity here . I tossed a coin to pick my finish . Fog hat gray . Hey ! Bite my glorious golden ass ! You people and your slight differences disgust me ! I 'm going home . Where 's that blue box with our universe in it ? Oh , you 'd like to get back to your evil universe , wouldn 't you ? And destroy your box with our universe inside it ! Nonsense ! I would never do such a thing . Unless you were already having been going to do that ! Wha- - ? ! You heard me ! In any case , I 've hidden the box , and it will remain hidden Until I 'm convinced you 're not evil . Everyone , keep an eye on your evil counterpart . And you all do the same ! Can Fry and I watch our parallel selves together ? We have plans tonight . You guys are dating ? Oh , no , no . We 're married . I got my eye on you , boy ! Don 't even think about it , lunch pail ! You 'd be dead before you hit the ground . Good point . What do you say we just hit a strip joint ? I was waiting for one of us to say that ! Bender A , you 're a prince among robots . Can you forgive me for distrusting you ? I can 't stay mad at what is essentially me . I love me ! This is so great ! I always wanted an imaginary friend ! I 'm not imaginary , I 'm parallel . We 're exactly the same , right down to the- - Is that pink nail polish ? Is that not pink nail polish ? The professor 's right , you are evil . And shallow . I am not evil ! So , Fry , Leela , how 'd you two get together ? Funny story . I asked Leela out a million times , but she just kept rejecting me . I 'd make up stuff like , " I have sweaty boot rash " Or " I have to meet the president . " Oh , man , you never heard such excuses . But , like a dope , I believed her . Looking back on it now , it 's kind of funny . It sure is . Right , Leela ? Funny ? Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha ! Then one night when Fry asked me out ... The only excuse I could think of involved ghosts . I knew he wouldn 't buy it , so I did what I do in those situations . Oh , Lord . I flipped a coin . It came up heads , and we went out . You mean you flipped a coin too ? And it was tails ? So that 's why you said you had to meet that ghost ! You really missed out on something , Leela . That date was magical . One year later I gave Leela a diamond scrunchy , and we were married . Ooh ! One year later I got beat up at a Neil Diamond concert ... By a guy named Scrunchy ! Well , that was pointless . Say , I hope you won 't think it " evil " of me ... To ask how you got that stylish head wound . Oh , this old thing ? I was experimenting to see if I could remove my own brain . Of course ! I had the same idea . I flipped a coin to decide if I should proceed . But it came up tails , so I didn 't . How 'd it go ? Well , getting the brain out was the easy part . The hard part was getting the brain out . Oh , you ! So tell me about yourself . Well , don 't look into it , but I 'm a respected internal-Medicine doctor . A can ! As for me , I design mansions , then live in them . I 'm lying . I 'm an appalling failure ! Me too ! A big fat one ! And those coworkers , always looking down on us Zoidbergs . What are they , from Nob Hill ? They 're all like , " Stop spraying me with ink , Zoidberg ! " " Put on pants , Zoidberg ! " " Don 't touch our fancy box , Zoidberg " . Oh , that box ! Too good for us , is it ? Someday they 'll watch from down in the gutter , they will As King Zoidberg caresses their fancy box ! You know , maybe a certain blue lobster saw where professor hid the box . Good news , everyones ! After carefully reading the scriptures ... We 've concluded that none of us are evil . Yes , the Bible is the real good news . Anyhow , you 're all free to go back to your own universe . What 's going on here ? Why aren 't you all out destroying the professor 's box ? Hermes , aren 't you curious that there 's two of everybody ? No . Now , like my granny used to say in her tarpaper shack on Montego Bay : " If you want a box hurled into the sun ... You got to do it yourself . " Your granny can go to hell ! I 've hidden the box so no one can destroy the home universe ... Of my handsome friend here . Oh , go on . Wait a second ! If your Hermes was about to destroy the box ... Containing our universe ... Then your Hermes ... Oh , my . And sure enough ... . Like Granny said , " If you want a box hurled into the sun ... You got to do it yourself ! " God rest her zombie bones . So we go back through the box and stop Hermes . Right . Good thing Professor B there hid it in the coelacanth tank . No one but a crazy lobster would look there . It 's gone ! All hail Zoidberg , the king with the box . Now it 's my turn , maybe ? The box says no . Meanwhile in Universe A , Hermes A heads towards the sun ! A. Item one : box . Check . Item two : sun . That 's a big check . Oh ! If I know parallel Hermes , he 's at the sun by now ! Our universe is doomed ! Doomed ! Now , don 't give up yet , you crybabies . The box is gone , but we still have one preposterously slim hope . Is it a kind of hair spray ? No ! We must attempt to make another box containing our universe . Well , is that your universe in there ? Nope . Too cold . Hmm . All women . I 'll put this one aside for later . It 's hopeless ! We 'll never find your universe in time ! Plus , this box is stuck on my fat head ! Yes , it 's the apocalypse , all right . I always thought I 'd have a hand in it . I 'm not sad , because I finally found someone as great as me . It 's like I always say , make new friends , but keep the old . One is silver- - And the other 's gold . Why with the long faces ? The idiots have the box ! I think she means you . Grab them ! You coward ! Wait for me ! Look ! Which one did they go into ? Oh , let 's all ask each other ! That 'll solve this problem ! We 'll each have to search a universe . Everyone , grab a length of wire first so you can find your way back . Hello ? Did you see two smelly lobsters ? We didn 't see anything . Ever . Yo , did two shellfish in scrubs go by ? Hell , no ! Shut up ! Beat it , jerk ! Have you robot versions of you guys seen any extra Zoidbergs around here ? Negative . Will you go out with me ? Access denied . Hey , pal , look what I snagged from the Leprechaun Universe ! Yeah , Leprechaun Universe is fine , if you haven 't seen Pirate Universe ! Faith and begorra ! Quis ? Quick , into another box ! There aren 't any in this universe , there aren 't . Hey , you ! What with the no boxes ? Baby , they 're somewhere . Everything 's , like , somewhere . Place is kind of au naturel right now . There they are ! Ah ! Gotcha ! Dig it ! All of you fitting in this box is , like , seriously freaked up ! Nonsense ! Why , there 's a whole universe in there ! Dude , there 's a universe in all of us . Right on , Professor Freaksworth ! Get a job ! We 've got the box ! Everyone , pull your wires ! Hurry ! Back to Universe A ! Hermes , don 't press that button ! Okay . Bye-Bye . Later ! So long , Your Majesty ! There but for the flip of a coin go we . So , Leela ? Seeing how the universe wasn 't destroyed ... You wanna catch an ape fight ? You know , together ? Well , I guess you deserve one more flip . So heads or tails ? You know , let 's just say it 's heads . Ready ? One . Two . Three . Pull ! There . That space-Time eversion has given us their box , and vice versa . What you think you just explained to us , is that- - Correct ! This box contains our own universe ! Sweet honeybee of infinity ! Bender , quit destroying the universe ! But- - Oh ! Yes , all that is and ever shall be is in that box . And the box itself is probably worth something too . We must cherish it as we cherish every moment of our lives .

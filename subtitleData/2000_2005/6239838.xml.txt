 Good news , everyone . I 've invented a device which allows you ... to operate equipment from great distances . I call it " The Thing Longer . " Observe . And ... here we go ... There ! Pretty long , eh ? Yeah , it 's really long ... but what did you just turn on with it ? Oh , that 's just the what-if machine I invented . You pose it a " what if " question ... and it generates a video simulation of what would happen . - Does it really work ? - Of course it works . It 's just not very long . Ooh , ooh , I want to axe it a question . As a robot living among humans ... I 've never really felt accepted at parties ... or nude beaches . So , I 've always secretly wondered ... what if I was 500 feet tall ? Let 's watch , shall we ? My work here is done . Aw , I 'm so lonely since I came to the future . Will you be my friend ? Ow ! Aw ! Who are you ? I 'm a big robot and I want a big cereal . You , too ? Will you be my friend ? Put her there , pal . I meant your wallet . - Three , two , one , zero . Ah , yeah , that calms the shakes . Hey ! Okay , okay , come on now . Stop ! The robot 's not your enemy . He 's just a poor , misunderstood ... Aw ! Well , there goes the neighborhood . There goes another neighborhood . We 're jerked . Nothing can stop a monster that big . Nothing except an even equally big monster . This is a chance to try out my experimental enlarging ray ... but we 'll need a guinea pig . What 's this ? Two meals in one week ? - Got you ! - Sucker ! Friends , help ! A guinea pig tricked me . What ? So , now Zoidberg is big , huh ? That 's more like it . Who 's intimidating who now , big city ? Hello , Mr. Chase Manhattan Bank . Deny my credit card application , will you ? Ah , the famed Apollo Theater . Boo me off stage on open-mike night , huh ? I 'll show you . Hey , I called this city . Quit touching my stuff . Tell it to the claw . Bite my colossal metal ass . Who wants lobster bisque ? Hmm ? Hey , Bender ... want to make shrinky dinks ? Who put this in here ? No ! Are you people satisfied ? This gentle visitor is dying ... and we 'll never even know why he came . I 'll ... tell you ... with my final breath . I came here with a simple dream ... A dream of killing all humans ... and this is how it must end ? Who 's the real seven-billion-ton robot monster here ? Not ... I. Not ... I. Good night , sweet prince . Interesting stuff . Well , Leela ... care to give the what-if machine a whirl ? Maybe later . I mean , I don 't know what to ask about . Come on , woman , just pick something . Yeah , be more impulsive , like this . Go , man , go . I can be really impulsive . It just takes me awhile . All right , Professor , let 's do it . Make that machine show me what would happen ... if I was a little more impulsive . Just a little . Not too much . Hey , guys , look what I bought on a wild impulse ... New boots . They 're like my old ones but with a crazy green stripe . Whoo ! Never know what I 'm going to do next . Leela , could you come in here for a moment ? I have something important to tell you . I can 't live forever and I need an heir ... Someone to spend my vast riches ... and take care of my man-eating anteaters when I 'm gone . The others simply aren 't levelheaded enough . They 're too impulsive ... not like you . Not like old , predictable , dull-as-dishwater Leela . Hello ? New boots . That 's why I 've made you my sole heir . The day I die ... you 'll be a very wealthy woman . Oh , my , yes ... incredibly wealthy . The day I die ... because you 're so un-impulsive . Oh ! Huh ? Oh , you 've killed me ! You 've killed me ! Oh , God , what have I done ? I just told you . You 've killed me ! Okay , just try to be nonchalant . All right , so you 're nonchalant . Quit rubbing our noses in it . Sweet giant anteater of Santa Anita ! The professor 's been eaten by giant anteaters ! - Oh ! - What ? ! If you ask me , it 's mighty suspicious . I 'm going to call the police ... right after I flush some things . Police , bah . Nosy meddlers . It so happens I have ... mail-order degrees in murderology and murderonomy . Zoidberg is afoot . Perhaps the professor 's files can clear things up . Let 's see , citation for public nudity ... conspiracy to commit public nudity . Aha ! A new will naming ... You as his sole heir ! That doesn 't prove I killed him . It 's a video will . It shows you killing him . All right , anteater number one , who are you protecting ? Is it anteater number two ? Don 't stick your tongue out at me . I need a name . What ? How do you spell that ? What are you hacking off ? Is it my torso ? It is ! My precious torso ! Hermes , quiet . I 'm deducing things . What do you got ? Disposal trouble ? No ! Everything 's just ... Sure is shocking about the professor , huh ? And now Hermes is mysteriously missing . Anyhow , it doesn 't affect me ... Bender . Hey , what 's this ? Hermes ' dreadlocks ? And his arm ? Leela , I 'm shocked . Food goes in the disposal . Hair and flesh go in the trash . I 'm sorry . I couldn 't stop . Well , wait . Don 't you care that I murdered Hermes ? Not even a little . There 's nothing wrong with murder ... just as long as you let Bender wet his beak . You 're blackmailing me ? Blackmail is such an ugly word . I prefer extortion . The " X " makes it sound cool . Please , honey , I 'm made of metal . Like you 're really going to hurt me with a ... Hey , what are you doing with that microwave ? Okay , that 's it . No more killing . Next time you feel like killing ... just have a stick of gum . Now to dispose of the body . Honk , honk . Wow , sporty go-cart , Leela . So hip and sexy . Not like you at all . Do you have any gum ? No . Ah ! The gang 's all here . Who are you ? Scruffy , the janitor . I 've never seen you before . I 've never seen you before , neither . Quiet , please . I 've called you all here to the parlor ... to watch as I gradually solve the crime . One of the people in this room is a big murderer . You see , the killer left one fatal clue ... This boot print on the professor 's lab coat . Uh ... couldn 't be me . I never wear boots . See ? Eww . What smells like boot feet ? This is preposterous . Obviously , the murderer is ... My next clue came at 4 : 15 ... when the clock stopped ... and another came two hours later , at 4 : 15 ... when I discovered the murdered body ... of Amy 's dead , deceased corpse . Scruffy knows who killed them people . In Scruffy 's opinion , it were ... So ... it 's just as I suspected all along . The crime is unsolvable . A letter from Bender , my good friend . " Dear Dr. Jerkberg ... " If you 're reading this , I 'm already dead . The person who killed me was ... was ... " My God . It can 't be . The murderer . It was ... I 'm bored . You 're boring , Zoidberg . I 'm going to go watch TV . Could you get the lights on your way out ? - Whatcha eating ? - Lobster . - You want some ? - Sure . You know , I think I finally figured out ... what 's behind all these mysterious deaths . Really ? Was Planet Express built on an Indian graveyard ? - No . - No ? - No . - Then ... Then ... it was you . I don 't know what came over me . I killed one person on impulse . Then I had to kill another and another . Well , that covers the first three killings . And now , to make sure you won 't talk ... I 'm going to have to do something really impulsive . So , Fry ... what do you think of the impulsive new me ? I like it . Good , now let me just get the lights . I really like it . Who else has a question for the what-if machine ? Scruffy ? Fry ? I have a question . What if Bender was really giant ? You idiot , we already saw that . I know , I liked it . I want to see it again . We 're not seeing it again . Ask something less stupid . Oh , all right , how about this ? What if I never fell into that freezer doodle ... and came to the future jiggy ? That question is less stupid ... though you asked it in a profoundly stupid way . What would happen if Fry never came to the future ? Hello ! Pizza delivery for , uh ... I.C. Wiener ? Oh , crud . Here 's to another lousy millennium . Ow ! I should have left you floating in the toilet . What is it ? It appears that the very fabric ... of space-time has ripped . Hey , look , an ugly , scared guy . Boo ! Who are you monsters ? Is one of you I.C. Wiener ? If that 's his pizza , then I 'm Icy Whatever . You believe me about the monsters , right , Mr. Panucci ? There 's only three real monsters , kid ... Dracula , Blacula and Son of Kong . Now , quit picking your nose and knead that dough . Hey , the usual , Professor Hawking ? No , today I 'd like something good . Hawking , you 're all right . I 'll make you the usual . Hey , Stephen Hawking . Aren 't you that physicist that invented gravity ? Sure , why not ? Let me ask you something . Has anyone ever discovered a hole in nothing with monsters in it ? 'Cause if I 'm the first ... I want them to call it a Fry Hole . There is nothing to be concerned about . I must go . There is much to do . Hey , Hawking , your pizza 's ready . Toss it in the garbage . There he is . Seize him . Who said that ? Uh ! Hey ! Hey ! Oh ! Ow ! No ! There . Who are you people ? I 'm Al Gore , and these ... are my vice-presidential Action Rangers ... a group of top nerds whose sole duty ... is to prevent disruptions in the space-time continuum . I thought your sole duty was to cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate . That , and protect the space-time continuum . Read the Constitution . Hmm , so I guess you 'll want to see my Fry Hole . Very much so , but first , meet the Action Rangers . You already know Stephen Hawking . Also with us are Nichelle Nichols ... A.K.A. Commander Uhura . Incoming transmission from MCI One-rate Department . It sounds like a limited-time offer . Tell them I 'm in the tub . To my left , you 'll recognize Gary Gygax ... inventor of Dungeons and Dragons . Greetings . It 's a ... pleasure to meet you . And our summer intern , Deep Blue ... the world 's foremost chess-playing computer . Bishop to knight four . Not all missions can be solved with chess , Deep Blue . Someday you 'll understand that . Where am I , anyway ? You 're traveling in a specially equipped ... terrestrial transport module . A school bus . So what do you nerds want ? It 's about that rip in space-time that you saw . I call it a Hawking Hole . No fair ... I saw it first . Who is The Journal of Quantum Physics going to believe ? Mr. Fry , the time disruption indicates that some event ... was supposed to happen , but didn 't due to a quantum fluctuation . That 's why we had to beat you with tennis rackets . If we don 't go back there and make the event happen ... the entire universe will be destroyed ... and as an environmentalist , I 'm against that . So then my chair tilted back ... and I almost fell into this freezer thingy . I call it a Hawking Chamber . But instead of falling in and getting frozen ... I missed and wanged my head . Well , it 's obvious what should have happened . That wang to the head should have killed you . Uh , what ? Let 's finish the job . No , wait ! There must be a peaceful ... - Hold him down . - Check . Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! - Whoa . - Wha ... Something 's wrong . Murder isn 't working and that 's all we 're good at . Let 's try something else . Maybe we should ... Put the dice away before I take them away . Wait , I 'm getting an idea . What if Fry was supposed to get frozen ? Yes . Shove him in the tube . It was my idea . Hey , there he is again and he brought nerds . Take this ! Get in the tube , dummy . We only have a few seconds ... before the universe is destroyed . All right , but I need a weapon ... to fight off drunken robots when I wake up . Here , take my plus-one mace . Okay , here I go . You fool ! You foolish fool ! Eh , what 's the worst thing that can happen ? Great . The entire universe was destroyed . Destroyed ? Then where are we now ? I don 't know , but I can darn well tell you ... where we 're not ... the universe . Oh , eternity with nerds . It 's the Pasadena Star Trek convention all over again . Anyone want to play Dungeons and Dragons for the next quadrillion years ? - Yes , please . - Sure . Pawn to rook eight . I 'm a tenth-level vice president . That story was preposterous . Stephen Hawking in a pizzeria . This thing isn 't worth the gold it 's made of . Anyway , " The Thing Longer " seems to be a rousing success . Good work . Right on , Professor . So that 's what things would be like ... if I 'd invented " The Thing Longer . " Oh , a man can dream , though . A man can dream .

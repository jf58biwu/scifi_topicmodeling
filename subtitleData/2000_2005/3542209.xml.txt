 Stare at this for a while , you ugly bastard . What are you doing here ? I 'm taking the specimen . No . I haven 't prepped the chamber . I don 't want him frozen . I want him soft . We 've already discussed this . I had to go over your head . I 'm moving him to our Scranton Facility . You can 't risk taking him through open country . This isn 't open for discussion . His unique ability to regenerate lost and damaged tissue . It just cries out for more research . You 'll risk the deaths of innocent civilians if he escapes . Yes . But I 'm sure Sergeant Marcus and his men can handle the transfer just fine . - Sergeant ? - Everything 's under control , ma 'am . - Dr . Wimmer , please . - He 's no longer your problem . Can we get that rag off him ? What the hell ? Oh , my God ! Get out of here . What happened ? I 'm sorry . Cryogenic breach . Emergency lock-down . Oh , God , no ! No . Kay-Em ? No viruses , no bacteria . No toxins . It 's clean . - It 's still cold . - Wow . What is that ? It 's like a big kind kind of frozen storage thing ? Probably a cryostasis unit . I 'd guess early Port series . Quadroport 11 . Manufactured in 2010 . Precise historic records are inconsistent . Anyone thinking what I 'm thinking ? Open it up . - What the hell is that ? - Humanoid . Organic composition is unclear . What 's on his face ? Some kind of 20th-century carbon filtration unit ? It 's a hockey mask . Very good , Tsunaron . - What 's a hockey mask ? - Facial armor Used in a sport outlawed in 2024 . Amazing . Absolute museum-quality . Are you paying attention , Azrael ? Yeah . Well , don 't touch anything . Guys . We got another body here . Kay-Em ? She 's perfectly preserved . Cell Crystallization is at 25 percent . 25 percent ? Suggest nanotech and phase one cell reconstruction . Wait ... Wait a minute , are you are you saying that ... - ... we can bring her back to life ? - Yes . But she is deteriorating . Opening the door has compromised her hibernation . Lou , get ready for dust-off . We have a priority evac . Copy that , ready in five . Not five , now . What the ... ? Look out ! 55 cc 's of etherene . You 'll be fine . Fine ? I 'm missing my arm ! Oh , you 're so pretty . - Are the doors secure ? - Locked and blocked . Beautiful . Lift off in three , two ... Yeah ! I love this part . - What 'd you find ? - You won 't believe it . Get the sarge on the horn . Division four just entered the occupied zone . - Casualties ? - Minimal . How 'd we get this screwed-up gig ? I didn 't join the corps to be a babysitter . - Brodski , - Sarge , we found a viable . Say again ? We found two bodies in deep cryostasis . Kay-Em unit thinks we can resuscitate the female . Female ? Yeah . Crutch , do you copy ? Crutch , do you read me ? Wake the hell up . - Yeah , what do you want ? - They 're on their way back . Power up the lab . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Whatever . - What does she look like ? - She 's cute . Yeah . And single . I 'm so lonely . We need to get her to the lab . - You think you can bring her back ? - We 'll find out , sergeant . - You won 't bring him back , will you ? - No , it 's impossible . Aw , shit . I forgot my arm . Yeah , here you go , dumb-ass . Hi , hand . - Any idea how long she 's been down ? - 4.55 centuries . Must 've been one hell of a wake-up call . - I 'm bitchy as hell when I wake up . - Did you just wake up ? Kinsa . - You guys always find the cool shit . - Where 's Waylander ? He 's in lab one , charging the bed now . Find Stoney and Adrienne and get to lab two . Once we 're in the clear , I 'd like to check your circuits . - I 'll bet you would . - It isn 't like that . I need you in lab two . - You found something ? - Two viables . - In what condition ? - Perfect . We 're attempting reanimation . - What can I do ? - You , Stoney and Kinsa ... - They 'll slow me down . - Just walk them through it , okay ? Run a structural scan and log them in . - I 'll check back later . - Fine . - Okay , where are we ? - Board 's all green . The N-2 's ready . Begin stabilizing - cell fractures . - Yes , professor . I need a scan . Glycerol levels , cerebral profusion ... - ... the works . - I live to serve . - Let 's see what we have here . Decrystalization of the membranes is at 32 percent . - Somebody get her clothes off . - I got it ! I got it . Honestly . Where 's her diffusion barriers ? Seventeen and stable . Here we go . Stay still or you 'll get an elbow where elbow where your wrist should be . Specimen 4420 found in sector 39-30 L on Earth prime . Subject discovered in cryosuspension . - How 's it going ? - Good . What 's up ? - Where do you want this ? - On the specimen table . - Hi , baby . - Hey , gorgeous . Initiating scan . Smart and sexy . Professor . Take a look at this guy 's scan . Amazing . How 'd he function with that small brain ? - Way manages . - That 's very funny . He 's a big boy . I bet he 's hung like a mammoth . Get out of here and come back when you 're focused . - You serious ? - Yes , just go . - Thanks , Adrienne . - Thanks . Don 't mention it . See what you can salvage from the optic cortex . - Then move on . - My pleasure , professor . Ready phase two . Bring on the ants . That 's it . Come to mama . Temperature , 96.2 . 97 . Cool . It 's working . 98.6 and holding . Cell reconstruction is complete . Internal defib in three ... two , one . Easy . Easy . Vital signs are normal and strong . No shit . Easy . Easy . Did ya get him ? Where is he ? Tell me you got him . Got who ? No one 's here . You 're safe with us . There was a leak in the cryo-unit and ... Was he contained ? It was contained . But when the cryo-unit ruptured , you didn 't escape it . It put you into stasis . For how long ? The year is 2455 . Now , I know this is a huge shock ... but you 'll be safe here . You 're aboard Grendel , a class-four , catamaran transport ship . We 're on our way back home and ... you 'll be just fine . 2455 ? That 's over 400 years . Secure line . Perez , Dieter . Solaris Research Station . Connect . Lowe . You bastard . We 've hit the mother lode . Do you know what time it is ? I don 't care . We 've got a goldmine . A box of DVDs is not a goldmine . I 've told you , I can 't move them . Look at the file . Two 400-year-old frozen specimens . One well-preserved ... One well-preserved , the other one , are you ready for this ? Up and walking around . 400 years old and walking around . Yeah . 455 years , to be exact . Who cares ? Who gives a shit ? People . They 'll pay huge money to see her . Let me ask you a question . Is this the first person you 've reanimated ? Of course not . How many people are out there today ... walking around thawed out and looking good ? - Hundreds . - Thousands . Maybe . But not 450 years old . She 's nearly twice as old as anyone . 250 , 450 . - What 's the difference ? - Doctor , a hundred years ago , when reanimation was ... more unpredictable ... sure , maybe . But now ... it 's old news . Damn it . I need money . Oh , I know . I know . The other viable is marked " Voorhees . " That 's not Jason Voorhees , is it ? What do you know about him ? Jason Voorhees . He killed nearly 200 people ... and simply disappeared without a trace . Why , to the right buyer he could be worth a fortune . I 've got him frozen here on the ship . You work out a list of ownership ? No list . He 's my find . He 's mine . What about your students ? They 're students . The educational experience will be enough . Doctor , doctor , you are one son of a bitch . Soon to be one rich son of a bitch . Lowe out . Professor , I think that ... we need to talk about my midterm . Poor baby . No wonder you wore this thing . Harder . Harder . - Who 's been a naughty little boy ? - I have . Harder . - A little harder ? How 's that ? - Yeah . - Oh , good . - How 's that ? Yeah ! - Daddy wants it hard ? - Yeah ! - Yeah . That 's it . - Right there ? - You like it right there ? - Yeah . A little harder for daddy ? Come on ! - Come on ! - You pass ! What do you think ? - Do you like them ? - They 're fine . Look , Kay-Em , I don 't think this is going to work . - Why do you want those things ? - Janessa has them . - Well , Janessa 's ... - Real ? Yes . Let 's not complicate things , all right ? I like you just the way you are . I think you 're perfect . Okay . Help , Wayland ! No ! Somebody help ! Help me ! No ! No ! No ! I brought you something to eat . Soon we 'll be at Earth Two . Earth Two ? What happened to Earth One ? Yeah , well , it 's dead . The oceans , the soil , either will sustain life . Can I do anything else for you ? You want to tell me what happened ? I take it being stabbed and frozen - wasn 't part of your plan . - I 'm a ... I was a project leader at Crystal Lake Research . The subject as Jason Voorhees . Jason Voorhees ? Notorious murderer ? We executed him for the first time in 2008 . For the first time ? We tried everything . Electrocution , gas , firing squad . We even hung him once . Nothing worked . We couldn 't terminate him , so we decided to contain him . Cryogenic stasis . Freeze him until we could figure out what to do . Seems sensible . I thought so . Unfortunately some people who were too smart for their own good ... felt that a creature that couldn 't be killed was . too valuable to file away . In the end , it always comes down to money . How do you thank someone who gives you back your life ? You 'll be alive for a long time . We 'll figure out something . Why don 't you just admit it ? You want me . I could never be with a girl whose balls are bigger than mine . Guys , our star patient is back . Tsunaron and Janessa . - Hi . - Hi . I see that my clothes fit okay . These are yours . They 're great . Thank you . - What are those ? - These are Janessa 's love children . You see now , it is that wit of yours that is what repels all human females . And you 've met Sergeant Brodski . - Yes . Hi , again . - Hi . And this is the lovely Kay-Em 14 . Tsunaron 's little love-bot . Easy , Janessa . Kay-Em is a knowledge matrix android . - that I have been programing . - Amazing . She looks so real . I am real . - Professor , where do you want this ? - Lab two . Where did you get that ? From your friend , with the hockey mask . You brought him on board ? He 's in the next lab . We 're safe . Safe ? Our scans reveal him to be very dead . Could your scans be wrong ? Get rid of him . He 's too dangerous . That would be irresponsible and foolhardy . He 's a valuable scientific artifact that must be carefully preserved . Much like yourself . He is an unstoppable killing machine . He 's not dead . Believe me . He 's definitely dead . Show me . I 'm putting us on lock-down . Attention , we have a hostile on board . - Grunt team , report to weapons . - The chick ? Repeat , we have a hostile on board . Grunt team , report to weapons . Everyone else , get to lab one . - Baby , I 'm not ready yet . - Hurry up . Grunt team 's assembled . Dallas is a no-show . - Sergeant . - Where the hell is he ? - I don 't know , sarge . - Damn . Look , sergeant , we need to talk . - Do you have all your kids yet ? - Yes . Oh , God ! Stoney ... - Stoney 's dead . - Oh , my God . Stoney 's dead . Kicker ! I want full armor and tac . I want nothing left of this guy by the time we reach Solaris . Roger that . Let 's get moving ! Whoa , whoa , whoa . Nothing left of him ? Take your kids to lab one and stay there till you hear from me . I just saved your ass . Don 't get cocky . You must feel like a wuss , huh , big boy ? - Check the score . It 's still 9-3 . - Yeah , but I got my groove on now . So , what do you say next kill wins ? Lock and load , killer . You 're going down . You are so going down . What the hell ? - I thought this was an alien sim . - Yeah , it is . Pause play . - I said , pause play . - He 's not pausing . No kidding . I think we need to reboot . That does not count as a kill . Yes it does . Okay , screw this . Game over . What the hell ? Drop the kid ! Drop the kid ! Now ! Azrael , get out of here ! - I got him ! I got him ! - I got no shot ! Move ! Sergeant Brodski . Don 't leave those kids alone . What 's wrong with you ? We 're near Solaris . They have 7 fully equipped unit that can deal with this . I say we wait and sedate him . - I am taking this guy out . - I need him alive . What you need is to get out of my way . Look , there are other considerations . Financial considerations . My only consideration is the safety of the people on this ship . All right , a hundred thousand . Two hundred . - Five . - Five ? - Dallas not here yet ? - Nope . Briggs , find him , bring him up to speed . Condor , you have a BFG ? You 're with me . Sven , Geko , you got the starboard pontoon . Sarge , what do we do when we find him ? I promised the doc we 'd take him alive . Man ! So , after you blow him to hell , put one in his leg so we can say we tried . Yeah . - Sarge , I got Dallas . - Where the hell is he ? He 's dead . Sarge , we got a body in bay two . - Who is it ? - It 's Azrael . What the hell 's going on ? Got a blood trail heading toward the cargo bay . Condor , Kicker and I will take cargo . Rest of you take portside . I hope they know what they 're doing . These guys live for this stuff . Sorry . - Don 't do that ! - Dude . - What ? - You scream like a girl . - Screw you . - You wish . Lou , is that you ? I swear , you mess with an engineer ... you 'll wake up with a waste hose in your bunk . Asshole . What the hell ? Crutch , get down now ! - What the hell 's going on here ? - Crutch , out now ! You wrecked my stuff , man . We nailed him . He must be here . Condor , airborne . Briggs . Where the hell 's Sven ? Condor , anything topside ? Negative , sarge . No sign of him . This won 't work . Keep your eyes peeled . Everything 's under control . Condor , report . Sven , report . Condor , report . Report ! Damn ! Sarge , we found Condor . What 's his condition ? He 's screwed . Let 's smoke this fucker . God ! Sarge ... Sven 's dead . Jesus . ! - You have got to get them out of there . - They know what they 're doing . Oh , man ! Geko . Geko . I got him ! I got him ! Yes , yes . See , they got him . Don 't take your eyes off him . I 'm on my way . Take your time . He ain 't going nowhere . Briggs ... get out of here . Kicker . Briggs . Where are you , damn it ? He 's all alone in there . It 'll take more than a poke in the ribs to put down this old dog . Yeah , that ought to do it . Such a waste . I told him to stay calm . To wait until we got to Solaris and then we could take care of this ... monster . I said , " Don 't go in unprepared . " Brodski was just too proud . Who locked the damn door ? Somebody wants to tell me what is going on ? Grunts are dead . - Which ones ? - All of them . Oh , man ! Lou , how long till we reach Solaris ? I 'm taking us out of hyperdrive now . Kids and their goddamn field trips , you know ? Just bring a psycho on board . I know I 'll get blamed for this shit . Solaris to Grendel , we have you on approach . Stand by for docking number . Grendel to Solaris , we need military and medical at the gate . We got a big problem here . Real goat fuck . Grendel , what 's your problem ? What 's your problem ? Look ... we 'll be all right . He 's trapped in the cargo bay . We 're locked in here . Can the Solaris grunts kill him ? Absolutely . I 've been in constant contact with Solaris . Sixty highly trained professionals are standing by to get us off this ship . Solaris to Grendel , pull up . Abort docking . You 're coming in too fast . Grendel ... What now ? - Warning . Prepare for impact . - Hang on ! What 's going on ? What the hell 's going on ? Everyone okay ? What just happened ? - Waylander . - Yeah . We overshot it . We 'll turn around and go back . Hang on . Oh , my God ! Solaris is gone . Gone ? - It can 't be gone . - Look . It 's gone . What are we going to do ? Lou . What sort of damage we looking at ? I 'm sending out a distress beacon . - Lou ? - Guys ... We 've lost our entire port pontoon . - The internal pressure is stable . - The main ... - thrusters are offline . - Life support ? We should be okay for a while . - But he 's out there . - We 'll be fine . We 're in a high-volume traffic lane . Another ship 'll come by . We 'll be safe here . Shut up ! What are you doing ? Maybe he gave up . You really think so ? I don 't think he 's out there . Why don 't you just stick your head out and have a peek ? Oh , my God ! Go ! Go ! Janessa , go ! Move it , move it , move it ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Where 's professor Lowe ? Hi . Look ... do you know how valuable you are ? I mean , fame , money . With my help , you 're going to have it all . I know people . I have connections ! Together we can make a fortune . We can . Oh , shit ! You want your machete back . Shit , it 's yours , take it . Just remember who saved it for you . Guys , it 's okay ! He just wanted his machete back ! I 'm going to go back to my room because Stoney 's meeting me there . All right , look . How do we get off this ship ? I don 't know . Could you beam us off or something ? " Beam us off ? " The shuttle . The shuttle . What about it , Crutch ? Yeah , I can do prelaunch from the bridge . Good . The rest of us 'll head to the shuttle . We 'll start ... I 'm with you , Crutch . - You know how to use that thing ? - Yep . Like riding a bike . Once you learn , you never forget . Kay-Em and I will go to the supply hold . Meet you at the shuttle bay . - See you there . - See there . What 's a bike ? We 've enough fire power to level a moon . Let 's pack up and head for the shuttle . So , you think we 'll make it ? The statistical probability of survival is 12 percent . Twelve percent ? Can 't you come up with better odds ? - No . - Bullshit , Kay-Em ! That 's bullshit ! Preparation for launch may be a simple procedure , but getting there alive ? It is a problem . You telling me that there 's absolutely no chance for us to better our odds ? Statistical probability of survival just went up to ... fifty-three percent . Want to go for a hundred ? He 's here . Quiet . But if he 's in here , he 'll kill us ... Quiet ! One more sound , and I 'll snap your neck myself . Got it ? She 's good with people . Did you see that ? - What ? - I think someone 's alive over there . We don 't have time for this . - Which way is the shuttle bay ? - Straight through . Go . I 'll meet you there . Just ... don 't wreck my pants . Come on , girl . We 're going home . Ah , Lou ! Jesus , that 's twisted . Course , I 've seen worse . Okay , let 's get to work . Brodski ? Okay ... We 'll get you out of here . Oh , God ! I 'll go get help , and I 'll be back . Give me your vest . - Bastard . - Hey ... Lucky you weren 't alive during the Microsoft conflict . We were beating each other with our own severed limbs . That 's nice . Okay . Let 's get us home . Kinsa , are you there ? Yes , ma 'am . Crutch ? Prepare for fuel transfers . Cells six and seven bypass . Hydraulic lifters . Pressurized and dampened . - It 's Brodski , he 's alive . - No shit . I can 't move him . Are Way and Crutch back ? - No , they 're still on the bridge . - I need help . Hey , guys . Brodski 's still alive but Rowan can 't move him by herself . Go . I can handle it from here . Tell them I 'm on my way . Watch your back . Crutch , how are we doing for time ? With a giant shitload of good luck we might be ready to go . Good . Rowan . - Where 's Brodski ? - He was here . I don 't get it . And I am going home . Lowe ! Shit ! I got company here , people ! Let 's go . Kinsa , open the door . Open the damn door ! What 's going on ? Why aren 't you on board ? Kinsa won 't open the door . She 's lost it ... and it 's a really bad time for this ! Janessa , gently . Give me the com . Kinsa , honey , it 's Rowan . I need you to open the door . No . It 's all over , honey . We can go home . All you need to do is open the door . No . Oh , shit . Come on , guys . Guys ! Jesus Christ ! Open the goddamn door ! No ! The fuel lines are still attached ! Kinsa ! Now what ? I ... Now , basically , we die . Bullshit ! Okay , new plan . You hold him and I 'll run . Hey , slappy ! Got a little something for you . Oh , wow ! Gave her an upload . Afraid I 'll have to hurt you now . Kay-Em ! That ... That didn 't go so well . Got you ! Yeah . Hey ! Giddy up ! I had it under control , but thanks . My pleasure . Yeah . - You did it . - Kay-Em . Who 's your mama ? All right . How you doing there , Brodski ? - I 'm all right . - Come on , let 's get you patched up . What a mess . Lab two . Tsunaron , is he gonna make it ? Absolutely . He 's at 80 percent already . This guy is strong . What the hell ? Way ? Trouble . The collision has compromised the hull . She 's bleeding out . Oh , no . No , no , no . - Tiamat to Grendel , do you read ? Over . - Tiamat to Grendel , do you read ? - Yes ! Tiamat , this is Grendel , we read you . Can you hear us ? That 's affirmative . We are reading your distress beacon . - Are you in need of assistance ? - That 's very affirmative , Tiamat . How soon can you get here ? Our situation is extremely critical . We 're four parsecs away , Grendel . ETA , 45 minutes . We don 't have that much time . Tiamat , this is Grendel . We 'll have a core implosion in less than 30 minutes . Do you copy ? We copy you , Grendel ? Advise how you 'd like us to proceed . We 'll take them down with us . Tiamat ... if you can 't get here in 30 minutes , there 's no point . What ? ! Are you high ? ! Tiamat , this is Grendel . You just ignore that last idiot . You get your ass out here , okay ? You come here and you save us . Why can 't we just go over here ? It 's no good . The pontoon goes , it 'll take the bridge with it . Not if we disconnect these walkways . You can 't just disconnect them . We could blow it up . There 's macrocharge in the weapons This could work . We 're going to try something . If you 're game , maintain your current course and speed ... and hopefully we 'll see you when you get here . Copy . See you in 45 minutes . - Good luck , Grendel . - Thanks . Let 's blow the walkways . Come on . Let 's set the charges . Who 's got the remote ? - Right here . - We 'll meet up in walkway " B. " Go . - All set . - Good to go . Hold together , baby . Impossible . - He 's dead . - I 'd say he got better . - He 's been modified . - Oh , you think ? Can you take him ? I can try . You guys might want to run . Kay-Em ! No ! Waylander ! Brodski , get in here , now ! Come on , guys ! Come on ! What the hell is going on ? Jason Voorhees is what 's going on . - Blow the charges ! - Waylander 's got the trigger ! Hey ... Asshole . I think she 's holding . I think we 're finally okay . I 'd clap if I could . Tiamat to Grendel ... Come in , Grendel . We have you vectored for approach and emergency docking . You ready to get off that boat ? Yeah . Let 's go home . Holy shit ! We got to go ! Now ! No ! Janessa ! Janessa ! Don 't let go ! Grab her hand ! Janessa ! Reach out ! Reach for it ! Come on ! Come on ! Oh , this sucks on so many levels ! Janessa ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Janessa ! Shit , he 's still coming ! - Oh , shit ! - Come on . Go ! - Which way ? - This way ! This way ! Tiamat , we 're at the evac door . So am I , Grendel . Lifeline secured . Initiate collar pressurization . Tiamat , open the outer doors . Damn ! - What now ? - Let 's get that bolt open . I 've got this . Let me try an override . Shit ! Oh , shit ! Come on , come on . Our exterior motor 's got no power . - What does that mean ? - Means I 'm going EVA . - What 's EVA ? - It 's a space walk . If he can jump the lines , we can reroute them . Hopefully , that door 'll open before this blows up . - Sounds like a good plan . - Tiamat , this is Grendel . Our escape hatch is jammed . We 're going EVA to try to patch it up . You 'd better get a move on . I 'm in the maintenance hatch . We read you . Opening outer doors . Those hatches won 't keep him that much longer . We need to buy more time . You 're the expert on him , right ? - What are you thinking ? - A diversion . I 'm at the control panels . Rowan , are you there ? Yes . I 'll divert the main power supply and send it to you . Gotcha . See the bright blue diode ? Connect it to the terminal . Was that you or me ? That was another part of your hull , Grendel . You are running out of time . Just a few more minutes . We can disengage and come around again . Negative . Just another minute . We 'll stand by as long as we can . - You ready , Kay ? - I was built ready , baby . Initiate . It 's working . He 's buying it . - Whoops . - What do you mean , " Whoops " ? Nothing . Not nothing . You don 't just say " oops . " I think he saw me . Oh , man ! If you 've got something brilliant , now 's the time to do it . I got something . I got something . Prepare variations using data file Crystal Lake , 1980 . Kay ? Here goes nothing . Initiate . - You want a beer ? - Or want to smoke some pot ? Or we can have premarital sex . We love premarital sex . Try it now , Rowan . Here we go . You piece of crap ! He 's done with the campers . He 's good ! Too good . He 's coming back . Try it again . It 's engaged ! The door 's engaged ! Brodski , you are the man ! Will we see you sometime soon ? I 'm on my way . Brodski , where are you ? ! Grendel , we can 't keep pressure lock . We 'll disengage in forty seconds . Kay-Em . Ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one . - Clear ! - No ! No , wait ! Disconnect . He 's coming this way . You 've got to be kidding me . Brodski ! He 's gone . I can 't believe it . Tsun ? Kay-Em . Are you okay ? I 'll be back on my feet . As soon as I have some . I 'll get right on it . It 's beautiful . - Look at that . - A shooting star . Make a wish . It landed in the lake . Let 's go check it out .

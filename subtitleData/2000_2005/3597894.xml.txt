 Dad ! Dad ! - Tommy , what is it ? - l 'm afraid. I heard something . - lt 's just the wind . - No. I think it 's under the bed . - Can you check ? - Tommy , there is nothing to be scared of . No . There 's something under the bed . You have to check . - All clear . - Are you sure ? I thought I saw something . In the mirror . Tommy , it is just your imagination . Now , let 's try to get some sleep , OK ? Dad , help ! It 's in here ! Help ! Help me ! Help ! Help ! Dad ! It 's in here ! Help me ! Dad ! Daddy ! Dr Scully ? Sorry . After lunch . All questions answered after lunch . Thank you . Agent Scully ? Leyla Harrison . What a surprise . Oh , good. I was afraid I should have maybe called first . How have you been ? Oh , uh ... Busy . And yourself ? I 'm back in Accounting now . Happily , mind you . No regrets . Although I did relish my big adventure on the X-Files unit last year . I have about five minutes before my next class . Can we talk while I eat ? Not a problem . It 's an X-File. I 'm sure of it . Where 'd you get this ? I tracked down a mileage discrepancy in the Bureau 's vehicle fleet . A secretary from our Baltimore field office used a Ford Taurus without authorization . What 's it got to do with ... ? She was desperate to visit her grandson , which is why she borrowed the car . She 's the one who told me about this case . This was her daughter . What makes you think this is an X-File ? This dead woman 's son , my friend 's grandson ... This is Tommy Conlon . Tommy is eight years old . Tommy told her a monster killed his mother , and his father knows all about it . I know . Why take the word of an eight-year-old ? But look at the autopsy report . Clearly this woman was murdered , and yet ... And yet the coroner concludes that she stabbed herself to death . Agent Harrison , I see no reason to disagree with the coroner . But , I mean , how could someone stab themselves 16 times ? Look , it is unusual , but I have seen it before . Tommy 's father took him to a mountaintop in Pennsylvania in the middle of nowhere . He took him away from his friends , his family . They don 't even have a phone . Tommy 's own grandmother isn 't allowed to see him anymore . I 'm sorry , Agent Harrison , but unless you have other evidence ... Wait , wait . Tommy said that the same monster that killed his mother killed Spanky , his pet cat . Unless you bring me Spanky , there 's nothing I can do . Apple and tuna salad ? - Hello ? - Dana , it 's Monica Reyes. ls this a bad time ? I was just putting the baby down . What is it ? I wanted your opinion on an autopsy finding . It 's pretty unusual - a woman who stabbed herself 16 times . Last name Conlon ? I assume you 've been talking to Leyla Harrison . Yeah . The three of us are headed to Pennsylvania . It sounds like you 're familiar with the case . What do you mean , there is no case ? All right . Thanks . Why didn 't you tell us you 'd already gone to Agent Scully ? - l didn 't know that 's who you were calling . - That 's not the point , Leyla . You misled us . Agent Doggett , we 're almost there . " How 'd you spend Friday night , John ? " " Driving around like an idiot . " Agent Doggett ! Both of you got in this car believing a little boy may be in danger . What 's changed since then ? Even if this isn 't an X-File - which it is - what will it hurt to keep going ? If Agent Mulder were here he 'd keep going . - Jeffrey Conlon ? - Yeah . Can I help you ? Hi. I 'm Agent Monica Reyes . This is Agent John Doggett and Agent Harrison . - We 're with the fbi . - fbi ? Really ? We 're here at the request of Dorothy , your mother-in-law. lt 's about her grandson . Tommy is fine . I told Dorothy over and over . There 's really nothing more to say . is that blood on your hand , Mr Conlon ? Yeah. I cut myself . - On what ? - A piece of broken glass . - Sir , can we speak with your son ? - He 's asleep . It 's not even seven o 'clock . Early for bedtime . Not for Tommy . And I 'd appreciate it if you 'd keep your voice down . Look , I 'm gonna be straight with you . We drove a long way . Agent Doggett is stubborn. I don 't think you 'll get him to leave until we see your son . Dad ? - Tommy , go back inside , please . - l heard something. I got afraid . Hi , Tommy. I 'm Monica . This is John , and this is Leyla . I 'm friends with your grandmom . She wanted us to see how you were doing . Tommy , it 's too cold out here . Go back inside . Do you remember what you said to your grandmom ? Something about your mother ? Do you remember ? Monsters . You said there were monsters , right ? No such thing as monsters . Tell Dorothy this is exactly why she 's not allowed to visit anymore . Now , good night . Come on . I apologize. I let my imagination run wild and I ruined both your evenings . Thank you in advance for not yelling at me . - Something 's going on here . - Wait . There is ? That boy only said what his father wanted him to say . Did you notice the dirt on that guy 's hands and knees ? He 's been digging . This time of the year he sure as hell ain 't gardening . I say we find ajudge , get a warrant and search the place . Dad ? The monsters aren 't gonna let those people leave , are they ? They 're leaving , Tommy . They 're leaving right now . It 's too late . What the hell ? Oh , God ! A possum maybe ? That doesn 't make any sense . How 'd it get from here into the vents ? - Who is it ? - lt 's Gabe Rotter . I have the thing you 've been waiting for . Who ? Gabe . Rotter ? I 'm a friend of Leyla Harrison . - Do you know what time it is ? - Hey , I just do as I 'm told . - Enjoy . - Whoa ! What the hell is that ? - A dead cat . - Come again ? His name 's Spanky . Leyla said you 're helping her on a case and you needed it ASAP , so ... Hey . You 're welcome . I am going to be exceptionally polite . Leave . Now . Leave now and take that with you . Do you know what I went through to get this ? I snuck onto the property where your perp used to live and I dug up the whole thing . I don 't care . Leave , now , please ! Uh-uh . Leyla said she 'd go out with me only if I got you the cat and , damn it , I got it . Are you calling the cops on me ? If only . God help me , but Agent Harrison might be on to something after all . Any luck ? Our engine 's shot . His truck won 't start , though I can 't find one thing wrong with it . - Looks like we 're here for the night . - l 'd better get Tommy back to sleep . Phones that won 't work . Cars that won 't start . It reminds me of a case Mulder and Scully investigated . A teenager who was struck by lightning . He affected the electrical workings of everything around him . - That 's not what we 're dealing with here . - Mulder wasted no time closing that case . I just try to think like him . What would Agents Mulder and Scully do in this situation ? Agents Mulder and Scully aren 't in this situation . Agents Doggett and Reyes are . I don 't know about Agent Reyes , but Agent Doggett 's gonna sit his tired ass down . What kind of a course of action is that ? I think Agent Doggett is saying that right now we 're in the best possible place . Exactly . Bottom line , we 're all concerned for this boy 's safety . If we 're here , nothing 's gonna happen to him , right ? Help ! It 's in here ! Daddy ! Help ! Help me ! Dad ! Daddy ! - Hey ! - No , don 't do it . John . How 's he doing ? He 's a hell of a lot calmer than I 'd be . I checked the place . Whatever the hell those things were , they 're gone . I have no idea where they went . That 's really good , Tommy . is that you ? - Who 's that ? - That 's her . Tommy , tell John what you told me , about what we saw in your room tonight . Those are the monsters that hurt my mommy . But my dad says I 'm not supposed to talk about it . This is my house . Why do I have to sit here ? Tell me what we 're dealing with . Don 't tell me you don 't know , because you 're not gonna like what happens next . These things were in the room with your son and you knew it . You held the door shut ! You wanna see something , look at that . Look at that . That 's what they did to me . They almost killed me one time before . They ? What are they ? Some kind of animal ? What ? All I know is that they won 't leave us alone and I 'm dealing with this the best way I can . - Now it 's too late . - How 's that ? They mean to kill every one of you , and there 's nothing you can do to stop it . Oh , come on . You saw what happens . You think you 've killed one and then it becomes two . I don 't think Mr Conlon is telling us the whole truth . - No kidding . - l mean , I think you can kill them . Because I don 't know what else he would have been burying when we showed up . You 've gotta be kidding. I can 't believe you 're cutting up a dead cat on your kitchen table . Will you keep your voice down , please ? You 're gonna wake my baby . This just isn 't right . Can you clue me in here as to why the cat 's so important ? Because it would seem that poor Spanky here may have chewed a hole in his own stomach . Which , you 'll admit , is unusual behavior . You mean he killed himself ? Just like his owner , Mrs Conlon , stabbed herself with a knife . The wounds are in the same place . And if we figure out why , well , then , you 'll have something really good to share with your friend Leyla Harrison . True that . Can you hold the ribs open while I grab that , please ? Just ... Now . Thank you . Agent Scully . This is Sheriff Jack Coogan . I got a message to call this number . Hi . Thanks for getting back to me . I 'm an fbi agent and I 've been trying to reach three of my colleagues that are in your area . Were they on some kind of case ? They 're looking into concerns expressed by the grandmother of a child . The family name is Conlon . I have an address ... No need . I was back up there a couple of weeks ago , got into a shouting match with the father . - Over what ? - Grandmother asked me to check on the boy . The father told me to get the hell off his property . The boy seemed fine , so I did . As I say , Sheriff , I need to contact my colleagues . I 'm happy to take a drive up there , but I can 't promise much tonight . The roads are icing up as we speak . Won 't be easy getting in . Look , Sheriff , they may be in danger . Could you please find a way ? Oh , my God . It 's no monster , Agent Harrison , dead or alive . - You wanna explain this , Mr Conlon ? - lt 's just a mirror from my son 's room . - Why 'd you bury it ? - Because he was afraid of it . I want you to get Tommy bundled up in warm clothes . - l want you to pack anything you might need . - Why ? Because I don 't believe one thing you 've told me , except that we 're in danger . We 're walking out of here , all five of us . I know what you 're thinking . Black magic . Mirrors are powerful symbols in conjuring in the dark arts . That 's what this is , right ? We passed a sheriff 's station maybe six miles down the mountain . It 'll be a hike , but we can make it . - Dad , the sheriff ... - No . Tommy , don 't worry about the sheriff . He 's gonna help us . What 's up , Tommy ? What 's the matter ? Stay here . Man , you 're a sight for sore eyes . John Doggett . - l 'm the sheriff . - Who called you ? - Perfect timing . - We were just leaving . We need a ride . Sorry , you can 't leave . - What do you mean ? - You can 't go anywhere. lt 's too cold . - lt 's not him . - What ? Gun ! Let him go ! So this is Johnny Fabulous , huh ? " Mulder 's so smart . Mulder 's so dreamy . " That 's all Leyla ever talks about : Mulder and Scully , Scully and Mulder . This sheriff , Jack Coogan , I 'm just getting his answering machine . Hey , you 're really worried . I thought you didn 't find anything . - You said there wasn 't anything in that cat . - No , there wasn 't . But it seems like there should have been . - What does that mean ? - The pattern of bite marks . It seems to me that the cat was trying to get at something in its stomach , to chew something out . Something ? What ? I don 't know . There wasn 't any sign of it but it obviously caused a great deal of pain . And maybe it goes the same for the woman who tried to stab herself . I mean , what if that was a frantic attempt to cut something out ? is Leyla in danger up there ? All I know is we 're wasting our time talking about this . - Who are you calling now ? - My mom . I 'm gonna beg her to baby-sit . - Got anything ? - Yeah . A salad spoon no one 's ever gonna use again . And the sheriff here ? Do not ask me to explain it , but he 's got absolutely no internal organs . He 's like a big bag . You know what else ? This isn 't blood . Whatever it is , I bet it 's the same crap that 's all over the inside of our car . I 've been thinking . Now , I hate to sound like Agent Harrison , but Mulder and Scully had a case like this , where they were trapped underground with mushroom spoors that caused hallucinations . - Never mind . - l don 't know what to say either . Maybe Mulder and Scully would see something that we don 't . How ? Nothing here makes any sense . Unless that 's the very thing that we need to see . - Agent Harrison , take Tommy to his room . - Sure . Come on , Tommy . What 's the matter ? You like Leyla , don 't you ? Can you stay with me instead ? Sure . Come on . I 'm just a cop , Mr Conlon . Maybe I don 't have the imagination to connect the pieces of this insanity together . You said that wasn 't exactly the sheriff in there and I wanna know what you meant . In fact , you tried to warn us that wasn 't the sheriff and help us . Yeah . So why not help us now ? Tell us what you know , Mr Conlon . For Tommy 's sake . Your son Tommy , you move him up here and you lock him in the room with those things . If you 're trying to get rid of him ... is that all this is ? I love my son . I love my son , you bastard . - You locked him in the room with them . - Because I knew they wouldn 't hurt him . Now , why is that ? They hurt you . They certainly hurt your wife . Why didn 't they hurt Tommy ? I made this . You drew all of these ? This one 's you . Why would you draw this , Tommy ? Why would you imagine such awful things ? Because I 'm afraid . Sheriff Coogan ? Sheriff ? - Are you Agent Scully ? - Yeah . I still can 't contact my partners . Did you get up there ? I just got back from trying . The roads at that elevation are way too dangerous right now . Sheriff , there are three fbi agents who may be in grave danger . That 's my girlfriend up there , hoss . This is the only road up to that mountain . You 've got ice leading all the way up to the peak . We have to get up there . I mean , there must be a way . I 'm sorry . Helicopter , snowplow or pack mule - unfortunately I 'm fresh out of all three . What if Tommy were at the center of this somehow ? The monsters . The sheriff . Agent Doggett ? Where the hell is the body ? Monica ! - What happened ? - The boy . The boy ! It 's all him . Oh , my God ! - This is your son doing this ? - l told you. I told you to leave . This is your son ? Make him stop . I can 't . You don 't think I 've tried ? I can 't stop him from imagining things . I can 't stop him from being afraid . He 's just a boy . He doesn 't mean to do these things . The hell he doesn 't ! If you won 't stop him , I will . Tommy ? Stay right there . Please , please ! You have to get it out ! Get it out of me ! Agent Reyes , hold on . Please , hold on . Mr Conlon , help us . Oh , my God ! Please ! Listen to me . Listen good . These things ? These things aren 't happening . - What ? - How the hell could they be ? It 's like I 've been saying all along . It 's not possible . No . No , this is all real . My wife is dead . She believed it was real and she stabbed herself . But because I couldn 't believe it , not really , it couldn 't hurt me . Come on . You 're gonna help me . Dad ? Dad ? Dad , get in here ! Wait ! Where are you going ? You wait here . What are you doing ? What are you doing ? You 're a smart boy , Tommy . What 's it look like I 'm doing ? No way . If I don 't stop you , my friends are gonna die . You think I 'm gonna let that happen ? You won 't do it . You 're lying . You 'd get burned too . You 're just trying to scare me . Scared yet ? Thank God . Agent Harrison ? Monica , are you all right ? Where 's John ? Tommy ! He 's breathing . He passed out . I 'm a medical doctor . You 're all right . Water . You filled it with water . That 's not what Tommy believed . " l want to believe . " So , this is where the magic happened , huh ? It still happens . I 'm happy it 's in good hands . Hey . - Speak of the devil . - ls that so ? Leyla keeps going on and on about how you saved the day . I really do have to commend you , Agent Doggett . You solved this case . If it weren 't for you ... I don 't even like to think what would have happened . It 's clear to me now that you were better equipped for this challenge than even Agent Mulder would have been . Your lack of imagination saved our lives . Gee , thanks . That didn 't come out right , did it ? So , any news on the boy ? We just got back from the psych center . The doctors don 't know what to make of him . I think it goes without saying . However , they have come up with a stopgap treatment . What 's that ? A way to stifle his imagination .

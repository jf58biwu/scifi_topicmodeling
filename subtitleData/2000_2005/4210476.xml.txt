 Under power of the state , I am hereby authorized To put you , Lee Ray oliver , to death by lethal injection . Is there anything you 'd like to say ? Fuck you ! Fuck every last one of you ! Hey ! All right , let 's go . Cover that up , please . Let 's get the bag open . Wait a second . Where am I ? You 're in the county morgue , Lee Ray . I 'm not dead . The injections you got in the chamber Were all saltwater except the anesthetic . What the fuck is going on ? You 're getting an opportunity , Lee Ray , To be part of a medical research project . Warden : If you agree to participate in the experiment , I 'll take your toe tag here , put it on that body over there . He 'll be cremated , you 'll go on with these gentlemen . If you don 't agree , the doctor will inject you with sodium pentathol And the execution will proceed right now in this room . What kind of experiment you talking about ? It 's a behavior-modifying drug trial . Who the fuck are you ? I 'm a neuropharmacologist . I 'm involved in the research and development of new drugs . I like drugs . The drug we 're going to give you is not a narcotic . It won 't give you euphoric sensations . And there may side effects some severe , possibly fatal . So you want me to be your guinea pig . No , you 'll be a test subject . You have one minute to make your decision . Fuck you , warden . Proceed . This is your last chance to do something good in your life , mr . Oliver . A chance to give something back to society . Fuck society . What the fuck has society ever done for me ? Huh ? Doctor . Just wait . Wherever we 're going , I hope it smells better than it did in there . All right , let 's go . Man : You greedy fuck ! So now you see how it goes . Every time I say fuck- - He does that . Because you , warden , Have a lot of fucking nerve . You thought you were gonna get another one , didn 't you ? But I said fucking , not fuck . Please stop . Didn 't I pay you well To let my man go after Lee Ray in prison ? Yeah . When Lee Ray offed him instead , did I complain ? No . I didn 't give a flying fuck . Because I found out the state was gonna execute him . So I am satisfied . But now you tell me That Lee Ray is actually alive And that you will find out where he is If I pay you ? No no , I 'm sorry . I 'll do it for free . That 's fair . You will find him and we will kill him . Third time 's the charm , right ? Oh , yeah . Um , yes , mr . Vertov . Third time 's the charm . Don 't fuck up ! You 'll start off by taking one pill every six hours . Just wait a fucking minute . Wait a minute . What 's this pill gonna do ? My name is dr . Copeland . I designed the medication You 'll be taking . It 's called anagress . It works by altering the brain 's chemistry By suppressing your violent tendencies . And with your aggression reduced you 'll begin to experience Feelings of goodwill and compassion , A sense of right and wrong , Even remorse over past mistakes . Uh-huh , good fucking luck . This is the first time anagress has been tried on humans And we don 't really know what the side effects are . Hopefully they 're minor . Dry mouth , dizziness , nausea . But there is a chance they could be more severe . Like what ? Well , liver failure , brain seizures , A stroke . Whatever . Years ago they might have given you a lobotomy , Carved out a piece of your brain the way you cut out A rotten part of an apple . But today we 're more civilized . We do it biochemically . Well , I 'd rather have a bottle in front of me Than a frontal lobotomy . How long is your little experiment gonna last ? It 's never over . You and the 19 other test subjects Will be observed indefinitely . That 's one pill every six hours . Open wide . Let 's go . Open back up . Smart man . Hey , Michael . How you doing ? Hi , pete . Good , good . I 'm doing good . Excellent . Michael : Is that austin ? Pete : Yeah . He scored two goals in the first half . He 's getting real tall . They grow up so fast , don 't they ? Aw , jeez . I just came to see how the team was doing . We 're doing good . We 're doing good . It 's not the same , but , uh ... No . Nothing is . Yeah . Oh , yes ! The guy seems like a real teddy bear . Two days and not a peep . I want blood , urine , and saliva samples . I have a pet scan and spect scheduled . Add a cerebral spinal fluid analysis . Yes , doctor . Mr. Oliver we 're going to remove your last restraint . I want you to relax . I just died and lived to talk about it . It doesn 't get more relaxed than this . Is it all right if I smoke in here ? Can I- - P.A : We have a security breach . I repeat , we have a security breach . let 's go ! All right , we got him ! Get him ! The man 's a fuckin ' animal . He 's perfect . Hey , aiku . oh shit . Computer : Zone eight activated . Zone eight activated . Aiku . Hey . Hello . Computer : System bypass . There you are . I 've been looking for you everywhere . You 've changed the code again . I 'm sorry but I thought we agreed You were gonna call next time you came by . It 's my weekend . You knew I was coming by . Oh , I forgot . I 'm sorry . How unusual . Hello , aiku . How are you ? How are you ? What happened to you ? You look terrible . Let 's just say it was a rough day at the office . Michael , I got a call from jenny . She said you showed up at the soccer match . I just wanted to go there . I wanted to feel what it was like to ... Be there again . I hurt too , you know . I know . And that 's why I 've gotta go . I know that , too . Come on , aiku , it 's time to go to mom 's house . Next time I 'll call before I come . All right . Come on . Hi . Hey . You never told me your ex was so beautiful . How long have you been here ? Not long . I was just in the pool and I saw her drive up . I figured it probably wouldn 't be a brilliant idea For me to be toweling off in the living room . I went upstairs and hid in your closet . How 's your jaw ? Oh . The truth ? You want me to make you feel better ? Hey ! Hey ! What the hell 's going on ! ? Man : Take the pill first . Where 's my hair ? Where 's- - where 's my tattoos ? Erased , like your past . In the next few weeks we 'll be making changes on your outside While the medication changes you on the inside . After what you guys did to me , You guys should be taking these pills ! Okay . But you first . Attaboy . That guy is pretty good . Beat my high score . Serotonin metabolite levels ? Barely registering . The man 's a textbook sociopath . Yeah . Yeah . Increase game difficulty . Okay . Let 's crank it up to mach five . Hey , this fucking thing is rigged ! Man in game : You can 't hit a thing . Fuck ! Game : Game over . This fucking thing 's rigged ! Take it easy . This fucking thing- - calm down . Get the fuck outta- - this thing 's rigged ! This thing 's fucked up ! It 's a broken machine ! Get the fuck outta here . Fix your fucking machine . Hey . There goes 10 grand . Take it out of my paycheck . Lee Ray : Get the fuck out of my face . Michael : Nikolai vertov , 27 years old . Do you ever feel bad about taking his life ? Bad ? Yeah , I feel really bad . You do ? Well , tell me . Yeah . 'cause if I 'd known that the crack-dealing motherfucker Was the nephew of a russian mobster , I never would 've robbed him , Let alone put a bullet through his head . Manuel jose gutierrez . You ever been in prison , doc ? Let 's not get distracted . I didn 't think so . 'cause it 's probably not what you 're exactly used to , is it ? The russian mobster I just told you about Took a contract out on me for killing his nephew . Gutierrez here tried to cash in on that contract . I just defended myself . You felt justified in- - yeah , I felt fucking justified ! Look , I don 't give a fuck if you believe me or not ! That 's exactly what happened ! I got the jump on him , he 's dead , I 'm alive . Gary david caputo . we got a minor bump . He 's alive . Just a little worse for wear . Well , tell me about what happened with gary caputo . Just wrong place , wrong time . It 's not my problem . You threatened to kill his brother for testifying at the trial . Is that true ? Are we done here ? Because this is getting really boring . You were what , 12 years old when your mother died ? You know exactly how old I was ! Files have discrepancies . I want to make sure I got it right . Now it says here that a former boyfriend killed her And that you witnessed the murder . Is that true ? Just give me the drugs and let 's get on with it . 'cause you never said anything about answering Any of these questions . Just answer the question . I 'll answer whatever I want to answer . And don 't you go talking to me like that . I am not your kid . If you don 't answer the question You 're of no use to me , And I 'll transfer you back to the custody of the warden right now . You 're only alive because of me . So why don 't you answer the questions so I can help you ? I was 10 . Not 12 , I was 10 . Thank you . And yes , I saw her thrashing around . I saw the whole goddamn thing . And then the fuck who killed her Took a piss in front of me . And then he turned around and said , " when you gotta go , you gotta go . " You wanna hear about what my uncle john used to do to me ? He had a little hobby that he called golf . He used to beat me with his driver every Tuesday night . Why don 't you write that down ? Write that down . Why don 't you write a whole fucking book about it ? All right . That 's enough for today . Yeah it is e-fuckin-nough . Brock ! I 'm everything you hate in the world , huh , doc ? He 's noticeably more at ease and much less agitated . Five of the rhesus monkeys showed results after only three doses . When 's his next pet scan scheduled ? Ma√±ana . Let 's do it now . Hi . How you doing today ? Hey , doc . I 'm actually doing really good . Good . It 's strange . I feel all different . Yeah , everything seems clearer . I feel less wound up . Hm , good .

Tell him to put the gun down . Okay . Tell him to put the gun down ! Put it down . Do as he says . Get outta here ! Tell me how to get outta here ! Tell me how to get outta here ! We 'll take it from here , doc . Get the fuck- - jesus ! You 're just as fucked up as I am , doc . You got a fancy suit and all , you 're just as fucked up as I am . Come on . You 're just as fucked up . Get off of me ! Oh jesus , are you okay ? Increase the dosage . Eight milligrams three times a day . Sir , that 's more than three times the previous . Just do it . Announcer : Hart-mercer pharmaceuticals : Dedicated to making the world a happier , healthier place . You 're too involved . There 's a reason why they don 't want A primary researcher conducting his own clinical trial . The man 's out of control , unsuitable . Send him away , we 'll find another one . No , we have to give him more time . I 'm increasing the dosage . If you don 't like it , you can hand my resignation in to the board . Be careful , Michael . In my experience If someone threatens to resign one time too many , They get taken up on it . Announcer : And now ladies and gentlemen , Senior vp of research and development Dr. Arlo penner . Thank you . You know , not too long ago , The acronym ssri was virtually unheard of . Now of course , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors Effectively help millions of people lead better lives . The reason why hart-mercer stock remains strong Within this volatile market sector Is largely because of dynax , This year 's most prescribed antidepressant . So on behalf of the board of directors And the shareholders of hart-mercer pharmaceuticals , I wanna thank you , dr . Michael copeland For your groundbreaking work Which continues to this day . Congratulations , doctor . Thanks . Thanks . Hey ! You look surprised to see me . Maybe a little . Did you forget that I 'm a shareholder , too ? Made us both rich . Well , as you keep climbing the ladder Don 't forget to count the rungs . Remember when all we wanted was that one-bedroom house ? With our very own washer and dryer . And I was gonna open up a center for inner-city kids . Oh stop , you 're making me feel old . How are you ? I 'm good . Hi . Hi . Congratulations , doctor . Oh , thanks . Oh , barbara , this is eden ross . She 's a post doc , part of the team . Nice to meet you . My pleasure . Actually when I was an undergrad I read your paper On the educational deficit 's effect on family violence . It was really brilliant . Thanks . Now I officially do feel old . Next time invent a pill for that , will ya ? Bye . Nice seeing you . Bye . So am I gonna see you tonight ? I hope so . What , are you buying a car ? Tuesday . Must be beef stew . I wouldn 't be too sure . Let 's go . I 'm sorry , Lee Ray . It 's all right . It 's cool . It 's cool , no sweat . I 'll get somebody to clean it up . Well , he didn 't hit me . I could 've made that accidental tray spill look a lot more natural . This is very good , gentlemen . I did a pretty decent iago senior year . Who the hell is iago ? I 've got his mao level . Lambda k-3 is.14. This is your last chance to do something good in your life , mr . Oliver . Come on , man , just chill . It 's all right . No it 's not . I think I 'm gonna be sick again . Take a deep breath . What 's going on ? What 's going on ? I keep seeing his face . Who- - whose face ? Gary caputo 's . Wrong time , wrong place . He was just standing on the stairs With a bag of groceries . And I should 've just run by and passed him And just gotten the hell outta there . It 's okay . It 's okay . He was in a coma for seven months . He had to learn how to do everything all over again . You know ? When I was in prison I used to- - I used to joke about him . I used to call him the turnip . I used to brag about how I made the guy into a vegetable . What 's important Is you know what you did is wrong . The treatment is working . It 's working . Why can 't I sleep ? Why can 't I sleep ? I just wanna put my head on the pillow and close my eyes And I don 't wanna see his face anymore . It 's gonna be okay . I 'll give you something . We 'll give him somnabol , five milligrams . Brock , that 's two tabs whenever he can 't sleep . Ladies and gentlemen ... We 've got remorse . Arlo : How can we be sure he 's not faking it ? Well , all of his biomarkers back it up . Ever since week five his serotonin And mao levels have improved steadily . Limbic and amygdala activity , As well as bfs measures have responded in kind . I think we 're ready for phase two . You sure ? Because of course the board and I both believe That it 's absolutely your call . But we all know the risks involved in moving forward too quickly . It 's going to work , arlo . I think we 've uncreated a monster . A lot more cell phones . Tell me about it . This thing is tight . You 'll get used to it . The only way to truly gauge the effects of anagress Is to observe you in the real world . A controlled environment can only tell us so much . Yeah , I haven 't been out in the outside in a long time . What if I fall on my ass ? You get back up . This is it ? I thought you guys were made of money . Beats your last address .

Bill 's not here . Lee ray : Gary ? Bill 's not here . I 'm not looking for bill . So many of this giant audience are on the new showtime rotisserie diet . I came here to see you . I like this commercial . Who- - who are you ? My name is joe . I don 't know anyone named joe . I 'm a new friend . I wanna tell you something . A long time ago somebody- - Somebody hurt you .

You count to 500 . If I see a fucking eyebrow twitch you 're dead . Don 't move , asshole . Move a muscle and you 'll be nothing but a bloodstain , asshole . What 'd you think , we weren 't gonna catch up with you with that lo-jack on ? What the hell were you thinking ? I needed to see gary . To apologize . I was coming back . Brock 's okay , isn 't he ? Brock 's unemployed . It wasn 't his fault . I had to go see gary . Don 't you understand ? I can 't sleep . I had to see gary . I was coming back . Here 's his train ticket , doc . Round trip . You were really coming back ? Yeah . Where else am I gonna go ? You gotta give him his job back . It wasn 't his fault . I bet you want him back . Michael : If anyone figures out you 're Lee Ray , If anyone knows you 're alive Then the whole deal 's off and it 's back to the warden . You understand that , don 't you ? Can I have a pill , please ? Couldn 't be . The man had a return ticket , for god 's sakes . What he did today was an act of contrition . 12 weeks ago he had no remorse And now he 's basically risking his life to apologize . The man 's a murderer , Michael . He was a murderer . You put a guard in his room , It 'll influence his behavior . You can 't do it . If anything were to happen , we 're responsible- - Hart-mercer pharmaceuticals . I 'll give you one more chance . Then we move on to a different test subject . Period . End of discussion . Arlo , is there something I should know about the other test subjects ? I 've told you . Any knowledge of their status Could influence your interaction with your own subject . Yes , but- - I heard a rumor from one of the post docs . Some of the test subjects have died of liver failure . If it 's true , I should know . Has your subject shown signs of liver damage ? No he hasn 't . Uh , the most significant side effects Are insomnia , dry mouth , persistent feelings of guilt and remorse . Nothing here about liver complications . You don 't need to concern yourself with the other subjects . You have enough on your hands as it is . And you shouldn 't spend so much time listening to post docs . Especially attractive ones . So what 's cincinnati like ? They got a baseball team . I guess you don 't miss it much . I just wanted to start from scratch . You know ? Yeah , me too . It 's a beautiful thing , isn 't it ? What 's that ? Starting from scratch . Oh , I hear you . You know ralph says you 're doing really good . He says you caught on quick . There 's not too much to catch on to . Sure you 're not hungry ? You want some dessert or something ? They got a really good ice cream sandwich . No . Come on , I owe you . Let me get you one ice cream sandwich . You don 't owe me anything . I owe you . Fairly smooth . What 're you reading ? " introduction to geology . " It 's a real page-turner . You go to school ? Community college , nights . It 's my second semester . Keeps me busy . The first time I saw you I knew you had brains . If I had brains would I be working here ? Hey , come on . you ever been inside ? Inside what ? do you do this very often ? I don 't know . For some reason I find it to be relaxing . It is . It 's like for a couple of minutes out of the day I feel like I can think . Yeah , I guess I could see that . Only thing is , you have to haul ass before ralph sees you . Hey , teresa . What 're you thinking ? Guess . Jump ! Did he see us ? I almost tripped over my foot . Haven 't seen him . He looks different now , I 'm telling ya . He doesn 't have them scars . He was in here just two days ago . It 's right there on the receipt . Look , we get a lot of people in here every day . Check the neighborhood . Maybe he lives around here or something . Yeah . Hey , hop in . I 'll give you a ride to your place . Thanks , doc . Let 's go . You check those books out ? These books ? No , I stole ' em . Had to pop a couple of librarians to make my getaway . nice . This is a sweet ride . I drove one of these at the car wash . I mean I only drove like 10 feet but ... You got a family , doc ? That 's none of your business , joe . Oh , I was just curious . I 'm just wondering if you have a family . I just think it 's inappropriate For you to ask me personal questions . It 's okay for you to know everything about me but I can know nothing about you . I see how it works . Just curious . What ? Come on . I wanna know . Okay . Well , my wife and I have split up . And we had a son . Is he living with her ? No , he was killed . Accident , or was he sick or- - no . Murdered . He was eight years old . We were driving home from the park after shooting hoops And a car cut us off . I laid on the horn , changed lanes . And he cut me off again just to spite me and I lost it . I flipped him the bird and started screaming at him out my window . And the next thing I know , the guy shoots at me with a gun . The windshield shatters . I pull over , turn , Tommy 's slumped over covered in blood . He looked at me and he said , " it 's gonna be okay , daddy . I 'm gonna be okay . " And then he died . I 'm sorry , doc . If that guy had been on anagress , maybe my son would be alive today . Christ , if I had been on anagress , maybe . You can just drop me off right there . I 'll walk the rest of the way . All right . Thanks for the lift . Yep . There ya go . I got a date tomorrow night . Really ? Yeah . Good for you . I was wondering if this thing around my ankle- - It stays where it is , sorry . What if I get lucky ? You 're gonna have to figure out a way to keep your pants on . Come on , doc . Sorry , pal , I can 't help you . I 'm not gonna run . I swear I 'm not gonna run . I like the way things are right now . I 'm not gonna run . I know , I believe you . But , I got rules to follow , too . Can I borrow the car ? Hey , have a good time . All right . Thanks for the ride . Sure . Be well , joe . They didn 't change a thing . I 'm surprised they let us back in here . I don 't think they recognized us . How could they forget ? I mean the flames almost touched the ceiling . Yeah , how could they forget how you tried To douse the flames with your milkshake ? Who was the genius who left his menu On the smoking toaster in the first place ? It 's a stupid place to put a toaster . Let 's face it , we both panicked . Tommy was the only one that stayed calm , Just unplugged it and got the manager . I think that 's the first time I 've heard you say his name Since- - Uh , I brought the papers for the lake house . I think we got a pretty good price . And it will be divided 50-50 As per our very amicable divorce agreement . Right here . Oh , I 've cashed in my stock options . Oh , really ? Mm . Hart-mercer not seem like a good investment all of a sudden ? No , but I 'm , uh , Buying an old school building downtown . It 's a major fixer-upper But my accountant says that real estate Is less risky than biotech these days . True . I 'm gonna open up that youth center that I was always talking about . Or at least I 'm gonna try , anyway . Barbara , that 's great . I think that 's really great . You know that colleague you introduced me to ? She 's very pretty . She reminds me a bit of me when I was that age . No . You were prettier . And a bit smarter .

Hmm . ¬∂ like a shelter in the rain ¬∂ ¬∂ I am the music ... ¬∂ Joe ? Hm ? I 've trusted a lot of people in my life , you know ? And ... Well , I was wondering if- - If I can trust you . Yeah .

Make you calm or something . What happens when you don 't take them ? You wouldn 't wanna know me . Well ... Whatever it is they 're doing , it 's working . ¬∂ like a shelter in the rain ¬∂ ¬∂ I am the music in your heart ¬∂ ¬∂ I am the whisper of your dreams ¬∂ ¬∂ I am the future ... ¬∂ You know , I should probably go .

I had a great time tonight . Me too . Thanks . Huh-uh . Something to look forward to . Why do I have the feeling I 'm gonna regret having said that ? See ya . I 'll see you tomorrow ? Yeah . I thought the lab rat was gonna get lucky . Tough break . Just in time . He 's overdue for his anagress . Shit . There 's nowhere to park . Drive around the block . We 'll find another one . Got ya , motherfucker . Hey ! Drop the gun ! Damn it . Shit . What 's up with this asshole ? Oh my god ! Oh my god ! Oh , shit ! Please tell me you 're not gonna get that . Hello .

He ditched it in the trash bin . I just can 't believe that he could 've gone- - Don 't you see how he played you ? He 's a confirmed sociopath . You should 've known better . Those bastards can fool polygraph machines , for christ sakes . What made you think he couldn 't fool you ? I don 't know . He 's in a black pickup with flame decals . Make sure he doesn 't get far . You 're authorized to terminate . What 's that mean ? You know the protocol . If the subject commits a violent crime during phase two , there 's no alternative . He 's already dead in the eyes of the law . That justifies hunting down and killing him ? Goddamn right it does . We 'll do an autopsy and figure out what happened with the anagress . Arlo- - go to the lab , make the necessary adjustments . You 'll be back on track in no time . Come here . Come on , get up . right here , right here ! You can get rid of all those scars , But you still got them same evil , motherfucking eyes . So what 'd you do ? Pay off the doctor ? The warden ? Where 'd a low-life like you get the money to fake an execution ? I 'm sorry about gary . Oh , you 're sorry . Well , that just wraps everything up neat in a bow , doesn 't it ? Right , gary ? Huh ? Fuckhead here says he 's sorry . He 's my friend . oh , he 's your friend , huh ? We 're going to the movies . You 're going to the movies ? You 're going to the movies together , huh ? Is that right Lee Ray ? You 're good friends ? Tell my brother what a good friend you are . I 'm sorry about- - shut up ! All right , shut the fuck up with sorry ! I saw you at that trial snickering with your scumbag lawyer . You didn 't have an ounce of remorse . Now tell my brother what you did to him . Gary , Your friend wants to tell you exactly what he did to you . He gave me candy . Tell him . I- - I didn 't tell you the truth About someone else hurting you , gary . I did it . Tell him what you did . I shot you in the head . I shot you . I 'm really sorry , gary . Shut up . Your fucking sorries . I could 've had a life if it wasn 't for you . Instead I had to take care of my fucking brother all the time . If I could trade places with him , I would . Shut up ! Look at me . he 's my friend ! No ! Don 't you shoot him ! Gary , jesus christ ! No , don 't ! Gary ! Get the fuck off me ! Get the fuck off me , gary ! Get those monitors packed up . Copeland . Doc , you gotta come get me . I need my medicine . Where are you ? Did norton make it ? You shot him in the heart . Of course he didn 't make it ! He 's dead ! I didn 't shoot him . Don 't lie to me . I 'm not lying to you . Bill caputo shot him . He recognized me when I went to see gary ! He just kidnapped me and he tried to kill me . Why should I believe you ? Do you really think I 'd kill norton ? After all this , do you think I 'd do that ? They must 've seen his car . Caputo took me in his truck , you understand ? Your guys must 've seen it . Have them check it out . Look , you gotta believe me . Just come and get me . Come give me my medicine . Where are you ? So where 's the fire ? Maybe we better find out . Shit . Hey . P.A : Dr. Hackman , dial 621 . Dr. Hackman , dial 621 . I need help . You want the emergency room . I need anagress . Never heard of it . Is that a prescription ? Come here ! Give me something right now ! Give me something to mellow me out ! What do you got ? ! What do you got ? ! Don 't hurt me , man . Hey , come here . What are you doing ? Where are you going ? Lee Ray : Teresa ! Teresa , I need your help . Teresa , are you there ? I need your help , please . I 'm in trouble . Please let me in . Teresa , please come to the door . Oh , god . Teresa ? Let me in . I 'm in trouble , please- - ralph called . He said somebody came to see him . They said you were a killer . That your name is Lee Ray . Is that true ? Is it true ? I was . I- - god ! Shit ! Teresa , please don 't do this to me . I was Lee Ray . I 'm a different person now . I 'm not who I was . I can 't be who I was . Teresa , please , they 're coming after me . Don 't do this to me . It 's the cops , isn 't it ? No , they 're not the cops . Oh , jesus . If you don 't let me in , they 're gonna kill me . Teresa , please . open up ! We 're here for joe monroe . Who ? Go ! Go ! Barbara : I got here as fast as I could . What 's happened ? Everything 's fallen apart . It 's all gone to shit . What do you mean ? Well , I keep on asking myself , Am I arrogant ? Or was I just stupid ? I don 't know . I had such hopes for anagress . I need my pills , now . What 's going on ? Everything 's gonna be fine . It 's not gonna be fine until I get my pills . You got ' em ? Get ' em yes . Not until she leaves . She 's not going anywhere . I know you didn 't kill norton . That was bill caputo 's truck , just like you said . And I know what kind of person you are . And you 're gonna let her go 'cause she has nothing to do with this . Barbara , go . Do not call the police . If you call the police , I 'll be in trouble . You understand ? Just go . It 's gonna be fine , joe . I just want everything back the way it was . Just please get me my pills . The pills are in my office . Get the pills . This isn 't enough . I gotta get outta here . What am I supposed to do when this runs out ? Eden ross . Hi , it 's me . Listen , I need you to do something for me . I need you to get all the anagress we have And bring it to my house . Can you do that ? Okay . And don 't tell anyone . Was that him ? What 'd he want ? He wants me to bring the lab 's supply of anagress to his house . Well done . It 's my job . She 'll be here in half an hour . Okay , thanks . What 's happening ? Did you hear anything ? Where is he ? What ? Eden ross said you asked her to bring anagress to your house . I tried to warn you . Post docs these days , they always put their careers first . Where is he ? I don 't know , arlo . He called about an hour ago . He wouldn 't say where he was . He just wanted his pills . He 's supposed to call later to arrange a meeting . The clinical trial is over , Michael . He didn 't kill norton . Bill caputo did . It was bill caputo 's truck they saw driving away . Joe monroe doesn 't have to die . Anagress works . All we have to do is get him back on the medication- - Anagress doesn 't work , Michael . No , anagress does work . Doesn 't work . All the subjects who took anagress are dead . Their livers shut down after six weeks . Well , he 's fine . He was on a placebo . He was part of the control group . He was getting nothing but sugar pills . If he was taking the actual medicine , he 'd be dead right now . But , that 's not possible . You knew there was a chance he 'd be in the control group . Yes , but his biomarkers , his serotonin levels- - Scientifically- - Never underestimate the power of the placebo effect . People have cured themselves from every disease known to science . Eradicated tumors , for christ 's sakes . But as you 're aware , Eventually the placebo effect dies . I need a drink . Anybody want a drink ? No thanks , doc . Hello . Michael , is he still in the house ? Uh , no , he 's- - He 's outside . He crapped all over the floor . I think he 's got worms . So I 'm keeping him outside . Does he still have a gun ? No . But , I think the vet should check him out . He 'll be ready when you get here . I 'm calling the police . Okay , I gotta go now . I 'm expecting a work call . Okay , bye . That was barbara . I call her whenever the dog 's sick . You know how she is . You still seeing her ? I always liked barbara . No , no , we- - we just share custody of the dog . You sure you don 't want a drink , ' cause I need one . Yeah , maybe I will have a drink . shit ! You can get yourself killed for doing this . Nobody 's gonna get killed . I 'm gonna get you to the airport , put you on the next flight out . I don 't have enough pills . What happens when these run out ? You don 't need any pills . What 're you talking about , I don 't need any pills ? You don 't need ' em . They were nothing but sugar . What ? They didn 't do a damn thing . That son of a bitch . When we start a drug trial Half the subjects are picked at random To get the actual drug . The other half are given a phony pill , a placebo . You were in the control group . That 's bullshit . No . I 've never lied to you , and I 'm not lying to you now . He 's headed for the lake . We got him . You knew this the whole time ? No , it would 've affected how I treated you . I just found out tonight , I swear . You knew the whole time that these weren 't real ? They were real to you , and that 's what matters . You okay ? Yeah . You gotta get out of here . Get to the airport any way you can . Here 's some money . Just go . Disappear . Go . Hurry . It was you , doc . What ? You 're the reason why I got got better , not any drug . No , you changed yourself . Now hurry . Go ! Go ! Okay . No ! You gotta go . So what do you think of it so far ? It 's okay . Let 's have a look outside . Okay . Oh , beautiful . Wayne , this is Michael . How you doing , Wayne ? Okay . Good . You wanna meet the other guys ? Yeah . Come on . All right , Rhonda , time to play a real master . Wayne : This is a pretty cool set up you got here . Michael : Yo . Yo , hey . I want you to meet Wayne .

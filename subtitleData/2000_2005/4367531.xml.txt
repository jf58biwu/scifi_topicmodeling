 His name is T 'raltixx . And you brought him on board ? He said he could adjust Moya 's electromagnetics so that no one would be able to trace us . Oh , great . So he 's like one of those mechanics on 60 Minutes who says he 's gonna help and then he screws us Crichton , we have to do something . Scorpius has left wanted beacons for us all over the commerce planet . What 'd you buy ? Dried food rectangles . - That 's it ? - That 's it . A thousand units of them . Crackers ? You just bought crackers ? Don 't start . I told them to buy something else , and - and they didn 't listen to me . Get out of the way . This is why we only had time to get crackers . That 's a wanted beacon . I saw ten of them in the market in the city . We had to get off the planet and straightaway here in case anyone figured out who we were . Well , it does make a beautiful souvenir , Aeryn . I 'm trying to find a trace signal to Scorpius ' location on it , and that way , we can go the opposite direction . T 'raltixx is ready . Oh , yes , um ... Zhaan has decided to test T 'raltixx 's device on your module . Wonderful . Wouldn 't want to use your Prowler , would we ? Well , no thanks to you , the module has Moya modifications on it , so we can monitor and verify the results . The central device I 'll make for Moya will be much larger , yes of course . But it works on the same principle . It programs itself on the inverse of the power drive . I 'll need someone to start the module , please . Yeah , of course you will . You know , I once bought a set of knives from this guy on TV . Cat swore to me that-that they could-they could cut through bone , metal , shoes . Hell , he could cut through my damn car and still dice tomatoes . You know what ? He was lying . Uh , I don 't understand . If you don 't wish my-my services ... Bingo ! Give brainiac a fluffy dog Please , softer . Your-your voice hurts my ears . Okay , softer . I don 't want you here , but they do . So , I 'm gonna start my engine . However , I love my module , so nothing funky better happen to it . Excuse me . Be sure to turn the power drive on for just 10 microts . 10 exactly . More than that and the central device will overheat and explode . Just gets better and better all the time , doesn 't it , guys ? 1 ... 5 ... 6 ... 7 ... 8 ... 10 . Oh , by the goddess , it worked . See ? Nothing happened . What ? What are you all looking at ? No , I don 't like it either , but he did it . The module disappeared . I disappeared . - How is your module ? - Checked out fine . I checked out fine . While vaguely concerned about you , I am much more interested in how this will affect Moya . Look , T 'raltixx 's device may be the only way past the bounty hunters that Scorpius is gonna to send after us . That may be , but I don 't think it 's wise to go to the transformation yards on this planet . He says he can 't build the device out here : it 's too big . Do you trust him ? Have you seen him ? He 's blind . He 's got a big head , but he 's blind . Barring the Yoda factor , if he gives us any trouble we lock him up . But do you trust him ? Hell no , I don 't trust him . Do I look stupid to you ? No , please . Don 't answer that question . Pilot , you do the long-range scan on the planet . We send Aeryn out in the Prowler to check it out . We 're going to play this thing safe . I think it 's worth the risk . Changing course now . My planet is one solar day 's travel beyond the five pulsars . - They 're beautiful . - Yes . - But I should warn you ... - Oh , here it comes ... It 's ... don 't worry , it 's nothing , really . But as we travel through the pulsar light , occasionally it affects lesser species . Well , define ' lesser species ' . Oh , genetic laborers , ungifted menials . It 's rare that it would disturb beings of your sentient stature . What exactly does this light do to these lesser species ? Slight impairment of judgement . Some wooziness , perhaps . - That 's it ? - That 's it . The effects are minor and temporary . Anybody feel anything ? Nope . No . I do . Oh , I feel good . The light . Oh , great . Two fingers . Thought you were blind . I am , but my other faculties have compensated . Uh , I developed an internal radar of sorts . I may never be able to read a database , but I can sense motion and avoid most DRDs Hang on a second . Pip , whatcha doing ? Oh , I 'm having sex with three Hynerian donkeys . What does it look like ? How come you weren 't up in Command ? Didn 't you want to see the pulsar lights ? I 've seen everything the universe has , Crichton . Don 't worry . I was listening . The light won 't affect me . - Are you saving some ? - What ? Crackers . What you 're stuffing in your face . Are you saving some for the rest of us ? Oh , well there 's plenty more . Right . What was all that about ? He thinks I 'm stealing food . He thinks I 'm taking more than my share . Are you ? No . Look . We gotta talk . What was wrong with that one ? Uh , too noisy , and my ears detect sounds well above your range . Is there anything further from the engine core ? Fine , I 'll take you down another tier . What are you doing ? Finding T 'raltixx a place to bunk . But he 's not coming in here . He wouldn 't want to go in there , cranky . All his senses are heightened , including his nose . You might kill him without intending to . Oh , but , you know , you might want to get back to the center chamber Why ? No reason . Just , uh ... Chiana 's eating all the food . That guy eats and craps his body weight twice a day . I see . Hmm . Yes . Reward for the capture of John Crichton . Reward for the capture of John Cri ... What have you done ? I haven 't done anything . There 's obviously a burn glitch in the transmission and I 'm just trying to see if there 's anymore data on it . Like what ? Like , uh , I don 't know , like why don 't you leave me alone and go and sit in the sun ? - You wouldn 't tell me , would you ? - Tell you what ? If there was another message on there ... say , a personal message from Scorpius offering you a pardon for turning us in ? Do you have to be so frelling annoying ? I 'm trying to work , here . Zhaan , where are you ? I 'm up in the maintenance bay , John , about to have a fight with Aeryn . Don 't do that . Remember what T 'raltixx said about the pulsar light ? That 's right . He said that it - it affected lesser species . That might explain her behavior . Then get down here . It 's your turn to babysit T 'raltixx . You brought his fuzzy ass on board and he 's driving me nuts . Are you sure you 're all right , John ? I 'm fine . Just get your big , blue butt down here . What are you doing ? - Hmm ? Nothing , I-I 'm just ... - WHAT are you doing ? Crichton-Crichton said Chiana was stealing food ! Oh , so you decided to get here first ? The little malik will eat anything that 's not maggot-covered ! Obviously so would you . Chiana told me that you would start to rob from us . But I 'm not . It 's that bitch ... it 's Chiana ! She 's not the one eating here ! But if you want your crackers so badly , I 'll give your eminence crackers . you wanted crackers ? We 've got plenty . You see ? Now eat . You 've got three stomachs . One of them must be empty . Eat them ! No ... no ... Pilot ? - Yes ? . I think there 's something wrong with Zhaan . She seems to be in some kind of trance . Is she smiling ? Yes , I think so . She 's probably just enjoying the pulsar light . She 's a plant . Put her in the light , watch her smile . May I ask you one more thing ? Yes ? Crichton and the rest on Moya , do you like them ? You know ... I don 't think I do like them . I thought as much . Pilot ? Pilot ? Where are you ? We 've been comming you for half an arn . Why didn 't you pick up ? I didn 't hear . There must be something wrong with your signal . Have you noticed anything different around here , shell-head ? In case you haven 't , let me be the first to inform you that people are starting to act a little strange . Why don 't you run a spectrum analysis to see what 's in the light to cause this . I 'll run a scan . Thank you so much . - Aeryn , just give me a look . - Will you stop it ? What are you hiding ? C 'mon ! Let me see it . If there 's nothing on there then show me the whole message . Back off , Chiana . Oh , sister . I 'm think maybe you should back off . Zhaan told us you were ... - What the hell is going on here ? - Nothing . She won 't play me the message . There 's a hidden message on there and she won 't show it to me . She 's out of her frelling mind . There 's nothing on there . - Show her the message . - What ? Show her the message . If there 's nothing secret on the beacon , then show her the message and she can get the hell out of here . Wait a minute . Why do you want me to watch it ? What 's on there you want me to see ? You know what ? Aeryn 's right . - You 're freakin ' insane . - Thank you . What 's going on in here ? Go back to your mountain , Grizzly , you 're not wanted here . They 're up to something . They are ! They 're working together . First of all they don 't want me to watch the beacon and now they want me to watch the beacon . Oh , yeah . I could give a squirrel 's nut what you watch . Why don 't you show her what 's on the beacon ? Get your hands OFF of me ! Oh , I don 't think so ! Aeryn ! D 'Argo ! What the hell are we doing ? Lookit . We 're fighting over lousy crackers and secret messages that don 't exist ! You know , we were never normal , guys . Someone wanna tell me what 's happening ? Sorry , John . That 's all right , champ . Just as soon as we get past the pulsars , everything will go back to ... normal . I hope so . And Chiana ... feel free to take a look or not to take a look . I-I really don 't care . Yeah . That 's right . I-I 'll-I 'll do what I wanna do . Great . Okay . You know , I was only trying to BE POLITE ! You all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Oh , yeah . You 're REAL good . Pilot ? Pilot ! Oh , don 't make me come up there . Pilot ? ! A little . You said ' a little ' . You said the pulsars might affect judgment ' a little ' . I 'd say that this is a little more than ' a little ' . Well , I 'm sorry . I 've never heard of the pulsars affecting sentient beings so drastically . Uh huh . And why is it not affecting you ? I-I-I think it must be my blindness . No one 's sure why , but the light disturbs optic neurons and triggers distrust . I have no neurons , thus no distrust . Just enjoy it , John . Enjoy it . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Have another one , blue girl . Ionic radiation gives her photogasms . Unless she 's faking it . I think they can do that , you know . Hey , Zhaan , you faking it ? Perhaps we should turn back . My device is not worth risking any of you . Shut up . We are not turning back . I want Moya to stay right here and go ' round in circles . There 's no point , is there , in turning back ? We 're already halfway through the pulsar field . So the effects should start diminishing soon . One would hope so . They 'd better . Rygel , I know you 're down here . Let go of me ! Did D 'Argo send you to finish the job ? Be quiet . I 'm not going to hurt you ... yet . I don 't want anybody to hear us , so shut up . Now , I don 't like you , Rygel . I think you 're a coward and a zannet and maybe that 's why I can trust you . You 'd be too much of a coward to betray me . - I trust you , too , Aeryn - Shut up . Now , I 've got a plan and I need somebody to watch my back against the others . Do you want to volunteer ? Aeryn 's definitely hiding something from me . There 's something else on that beacon . You think she 's trying to contact Scorpius ? Through the beacon ? She could be trying to turn us in . Working with Crichton ? I 'm not sure . The only way to protect ourselves is to get off this ship . - Chiana , we ... - You deal with it . - Hello , D 'Argo . - What do you want , Zhaan ? More light . Are you working with Crichton ? What are you talking about ? Leave me alone . She 's definitely working with Crichton . Definitely . I 'm only judging on my experience with you , but I 've never seen such a deficient species . Have you run a scan on the pulsar light yet ? How do humans make it through a cycle ... even half a cycle ... without killing each other ? We find it difficult . Have you run the scan ? You have no special abilities . You 're not particularly smart , can hardly smell , can barely see , and you 're not even vaguely physically or spiritually imposing . Is there anything you do well ? Watch football . Have you run the scan ? Nobody trusts you , Crichton . Do you know that ? Sometimes they pity you because of your incompetence ... Mama always said ... ... you want something done , you DO it yourself . Don 't touch my console ! Oh , you want to talk about incompetence - Off you go ! Away ! - ... Moya would dump your ass in a heartbeat I warned you . Pilot , - what the hell 's happened to you ? - Nothing 's happening to me . - Can you see the light ? - What are you talking about ? The pulsar light . Does it physically come in here ? No , my readings of it are registered on Moya 's database . So you can 't actually see the light . So WHY are you being affected by it ? I 'm not . Now , get out . I 've been in the light . Zhaan 's been in the light . But ... Hey , guys . I think I 'm onto something . Stay back ! We 're only taking our equal share of food . I 'm just trying to ... If he comes any closer , shoot him . Look , don 't make me crazy , okay ? It 's hard enough trying to ... People have been stealing food , so we 're only going to take what we ... I don 't care about crackers ! - We do . - We want food Is that what this is all about ? Is that it ? Okay . Then where 's my ice cream ? - What ? - Where it is my ice cream - Savage , I know almost every food in the galaxy - Where 's my damn ice cream ? ! I have no idea what " eye is green " is . Is that it , Sparky ? Gonna take the road well-traveled ? Gonna play dumb ? I scream , you scream , we all scream for ice cream ! Baskin Robbins , Ben and Jerry 's , Good Humor . What 's your favorite creamsicle or fudgesicle ? T 'raltixx . Where are my DRDs ? There are none up here . I 'm sorry , Pilot . I should have told you . I need their help . For what ? For the darkness . It hurts my eyes and makes me blind . I need to make light , Pilot . Bright light . What are you doing in there ? Don 't be alarmed . I 'm just altering Moya 's bioluminescence for a few moments . It won 't hurt her . Trust me . I don 't . The rest of your crew you trust them ? What ? Do you trust them ? I don 't know . Do you need the rest of them in order to function ? No . They get in the way more than help . I suspected that . I can help you , Pilot . If you help me , I think I may have a proposition for that you may find agreeable . Go on . Hurry up . You 're not moving fast enough . So why don 't you get off your fat ass and help me ? Did you kill Zhaan ? No . No , she was walking around all zapped out , so I , uh ... Now , she was reporting back to you , wasn 't she ? Gilligan and Mary Ann . Maybe you 're Ginger I 'd have to , uh , see you in a Wonderbra to know . Where are you guys takin ' the Minnow ? We 're just getting off Moya . In my module ? I don 't think so . Afraid it needs this to fly . And I 've disabled the hangar doors , so no one is getting off the boat He didn 't care about Zhaan . What ? Uh ... D 'Argo , he , um , he just left her here . You said she was working for him - Well , she was , she , um ... - Oh , she was ? Stay back ! Chiana , I No , you stay back . I 'm not planning on stealing your food , Rygel . I know that . Well , then , stay alert while I do this . We need some bargaining power in this Oh , stop nagging . I 'm watching your back ! Oh , brilliant . At this rate then , I 'll survive - - what - - an extra 2 microts ? If you don 't watch it , bitch , I 'll just back into an air duct and you 'll be What ? Run away , as always ? I never run away . I ... strategically maneuver . Really ? ! Here 's Johnny ! - Hiya , honey ! - Go away ! Hiya , kids . What 's going on ? Is this a ... French Revolution type of thing ? Stay out . Listen , I might be crazy ... could be but I got a plan . What do you say we all put our guns down ... . lock ' em in a closet . That way nobody gets hurt No ! Honey ... please ? Shit ! Next time you 'll be a crouton , Crichton . - Pilot , Pilot . - Something the matter , Crichton ? It 's that damn Peacekeeper bitch . She 's barricaded herself in the Command . I think she 's trying to take over the ship . I 'm aware of her actions . Shut her down . Lights , power , all of it . I 'm sorry , John . I cannot do that . What ? Pilot ? Pilot ! Got a bit of a problem , Commander ? Well , now you 've got one more . Because the only way you 're going to get my weapon is if I 'm dead ! Look at what you 're doing . What ? Look . Yes . You 're right . You 're so right . He 's absolutely right . The power setting 's too low . Thank you . So much better ! You missed ! ... Crichton . His name is John Crichton ... Whatcha doin ' ? Hey , missy , why you messing with that beacon ? Oh , hey , Johnny . Well , I 'm not messing with nothing . Oh ... god ... damn ... . They don 't get it . They don 't get it , Scorpy . They don 't get how crazy they are . You 're right , John . They don 't get it . They don 't get how crazy they are ... because ... 'Cause they stole the crackers . You 'll never be able to take over Moya . Pilot won 't let you . I have disabled his ability to spy on us up here . We just have to hope that the others keep him busy . Hope ? Your great plan depends on hope ? What if Pilot pumps poison gas in here , or We have to risk it , don 't we ? In any assault , a soldier has to take chances and attack the nerve center . Shut up . I don 't need a grunt to give me a military assault lecture . I wrote military assault lectures . You ? The only thing you 've ever assaulted is a plate of food cubes . Now shut up . And you remember that cracker ? That older kid - - Howie Lewis - - who beat you up for it ? You were just 12 . It took months , but you got even . And you poured sugar in poor Howie 's Harley . Howie had no idea it was you Yes , revenge is a dish best served cold , and you like revenge , don 't you Shut up ! I hate it when villains quote Shakespeare . They 're coming to kill you , John . We 'd better get ready . I need more light ! I 'm already boosting in three additional core channels . I need more . Please , Pilot . You save me , then I 'll save you . Save me from who ? From the others ! Don 't you understand ? They 're plotting against you . You may not trust me ... but believe me , trust them much less ! Boosting in two more core channels . Drop it . Oh , go ahead . Try it , Medusa , try it . Down boy . Roll over . Good boy . Go on . Kill me . Go on , John , do it . Then we can go to the beach ! I know a place with naked sebacean girls and margarita shooters . Go away , Scorpy . You 're not real . Oh . What ? What ? Am I being ... irritational ? Oh . Well , have a little pain . Finish him . FINISH him . Then we can go to that little Italian joint I know . I don 't like Italian . Don 't be a coward . Kill him , not me . Him ! D 'Argo ? Zhaan ? Hi , baby . Crichton ? Don 't , I-I can help you . No , no , no , no , no . I 'm still aching ' from the last time you helped me . What a slut . Is that why your family abandoned you ? Because you 'd spread ' em for anybody , anytime ? John , please . Please , don 't . No , ' fraid not . My little black book ... is all full . John . Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . Show a little bit of patience . Tie her up . Then we can save her for dessert . Kill the others . Then we can have a little bit of fun with her . Nice . I like that idea . Hurry up . Do you hear him ? Hurry up . Crichton 's coming . You 're gonna sell me out , aren 't you , when he comes . You 're gonna switch sides ? No ! . You 're lying . You know how I know that ? Because you always lie . You have no integrity . You have no honor . You cheat , you steal , you stuff your face . That 's you ! Well , well , well . This is becoming a problem you 're gonna need professional help with . First you betray the Peacekeepers ... and every vow you 've made since you were born ... And now poor Sparky , here ? Tell , me Princess ... when you 're old and fat ... will you have anything to look back on with pride ? Is that it ? Oh , don 't stop . Why don 't you make another speech , you self-important , deficient little man . All you ever do is talk ! Your father was the hero , you know . He did things . You , you 're just this test monkey that screwed up your first experiment . That is good ! That is fantastic ... coming from a frigid , flat-butted Peacekeeper SKANK ! Kill her . Then we 'll have pizza . And some margarita shooters . Go on , John . Kill her . Do it . Do it . Nobody ... has margaritas with pizza . You 're out of your mind , John . I know . Are you cracking up , little man ? - Hello ? - Uh , I 'm okay , Aeryn . This Oh , no , no , no , no , no ! I am tired of having to always listen to YOU . Aeryn . Listen ... I just shot Scorpius . Shut up . You 're wrong , you know . When I 'm old and fat when I 'm old , there is one thing I 'm going to look back on with enormous pride , and that is killing you Aeryn , he wanted me to shoot you . Have you got any spare cartridges ? Hiya , kids . Let me go . I command it , you miserable No one 's going anywhere , not even to Disneyland . Not before we all have the breakfast of losers . Oh , look everybody . Sunshine 's awake ! Ronaldo ! Even on a flesh wound . Ow , ow , ow , ow ! That must hurt . Sorry . Now that we 're all here , and so happy , do you think we could all get along for three microts ? But D 'Argo , I need you to understand ... that crackers don 't matter . Woo ! Ha ! Have I got your attention NOW ? Good . So , class . Today 's assignment is ... anyone ? Anyone ? Anyone ? A brand new car ! No ! It 's T 'raltixx ! T plus R-A-L-T-I double X. T 'raltixx . Since he came on board , we 've been fighting about everything , including these . Now , I 've been acting twisted , as well . Still am . Been seeing Scorpius like he 's guest-starring on Hawaii 5-0 . Huh - - how crazy is THAT ? But - - I realized something . Frigging nuts I am , it 's not the pulsars affecting ME . Look , if you want me to believe anything you 're saying Shut up ! Frell you ! We are past the pulsars . So how come we 're acting even crazier ? Zhaan ? Stop bothering me . I 'm busy . Yes , yes , yes . Private moment number three hundred and forty-four . - Tell them . - You tell them . When I was near T 'raltixx , I was more affected than when I was in the light . He-he made me feel ... Enough . Go for three hundred and forty-five . So . I have ... as much as I hate to do this I have to ask for your help Wrong answer ! I 'm at systems overload ! I need more light ! But why ? I 'm not sure if I can . Mooooore liiiiiight ! All right ! Can you feel it , Pilot ? All of Moya is beginning to glow . I am magnificent ! Look , I want you to look at what he 's doing to Moya . Look at the walls ! They 're glowing . Look . Why ? Why would he want us to fight amongst each other ? He wants us out of the way so he can create light . Mm . I noticed between pleasures ... . he has hundreds of DRDs working so his chambers are glowing I think it 's time that we paid this creep a visit . Kill him . Undo me . Can I trust you ? No . At least you 're honest . Now . Unless you plan on actually pulling the trigger , don 't ever pull a gun on me like that again . - I was making a point . - So was I. Don 't . Stop it . Focus here . Okay . T 'raltixx said that we 're attacked through our optic neurons . That 's how he 's getting to us . But I can deal with it . You just gotta find a way to keep the light and heat off of me , and I 'm gonna go in there and kill him . You ? ! We 're not sending YOU in there after him . Oh , yeah ? Well , I 'm the only one around here keeping it vaguely under control . - Huh ! Says who ? - Says me , Buckwheat ! You are no warrior . I will kill T 'raltixx . No , you will not . I will . You 're wounded . No way . I want the first shot . Look at you two bozos . You 'd kill each other before you got anywhere near T 'raltixx . He 's right . He 's gotta do it . Why ? Don 't you get it , furball ? Look , Crichton 's the only one not affected by T 'raltixx because he 's deficient . - Who you calling deficient ? - You . You 've got the worst eyes out of all of us . That 's why your optic nerves aren 't being affected . I got GREAT eyes . They 're better than 20 / 20 , and they 're BLUE . Oh , okay . So , can you read the symbols on the basin over there ? There 's nothing there . " Warning ... " . " Don 't flush corrosives .. " . " Down the waste tunnel . " . That 's all right . That 's a joke . Excellent . If we 're gonna let blue-eyes save the day , we 'd better come up with a very good plan . I 'm not deficient . I 'm superior . Humans are superior . What the hell is this ? Heat-deflecting paste . You 'll burn up in there without it . Smells like puke . I pre-digested it to increase its potency . It 's puke ? ! We 're going to have to move fast . All of Moya is glowing . I hate these goggles . They look like crap . Stop whining . You sound like a zelma . They 're the only thing that will stop you from going blind in there . Probably will , anyway . Here , this may be of some use to you . I made it from a piece of my Prowler and it will withstand a zakkian laser pulse . Thank you . Solar-reflecting flare wrap . Pull it on tight . Does this strike any of you superior beings as a little bit ironic ? Why ? I 'm the deficient one and I 'm still saving your butts . Bend over . We soaked it in Zhaan 's bio-paste for as long as we could . Great . I look ridiculous , don 't I ? Don 't worry . This is T 'raltixx 's disappearing device . So it won 't matter how ridiculous you look . We are going to die . We 've attached you to the module in the transport hangar . Fire the drive up for ten microts , no more . No mippippippi . I do not want to blow up . When you get in there , cut off as many of the power conductors as you can . That should reduce his strength so that you can then get close enough to kill him , all right ? - Damn , it 's bright in there . - You ready ? Now , Rygel . Only ten . Yes . - Is it working ? - It 's working . Go , John . Go . There 's someone in here , Pilot . I see no one . Five ... six ... - What are you doing , Pilot ? - Nothing . My light ! Nine ... ten eleven ... twelve ... Stop ! Crichton . Ha ! Crap ! You can 't stop me , Crichton . I have the light ! But humans are superior ! You 're too weak , Crichton . I will kill you ! I-I will get the light and take over your ship , and then Give me the light ! Ah ! I need more light ! - What about this ? - You cannot stop me , Crichton ! Go on , kill me ! Well , there are thousands just like me . We will find another leviathan to make our light ! And when we do , we 'll spread like a plague ! We 'll rise from our dormancy and kill you all ! I told them it was a mistake bringing you on board ... . I have talked with everyone else . All I can say is I 'm terribly sorry . T 'raltixx somehow brought out the worst in me . I think he brought out the worst in all of us , Pilot . Yes . - Your apology is accepted . - Thank you . Thank you both . I , uh ... I am ashamed of what I did . I thought you were going to kill me . I 'm sorry , Rygel . Can you forgive me ? No . Not ... yet . That did it ! Damn , that was heavy . How did you move it by yourself ? Hm ? Oh , I don 't know . I just did . - Hey , now , look . I 'm sorry . I 'm really sorry about - Oh , no , no . Look , don 't apologize . I was impressed . How did you come up with all of that crap ? I don 't know , Pip . It 's just there ... . Did I ... did I say anything awful , Chiana ? You don 't remember ? No . T 'raltixx triggered such a an intense reaction in me ... I blanked everything out . Whoa . I wish I could do that . No , no , no , Zhaan . Look , you were the best out of all of us . You looked like you were having a great time . Listen , uh ... anything I said , I , uh ... Uh ... I know . Me , too ... . Humpty-Dumpty sat on a wall . " And all the King 's horses and all the King 's men ... . " . Hey , Zhaan . How do we take it all back ?

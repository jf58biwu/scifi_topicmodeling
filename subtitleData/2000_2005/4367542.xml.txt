 Previously on Farscape Welcome home , son . Scorpius is here ... looking for the key to what is inside my head . He will use you ... and the baby ... Skreeth ... I 'm confident I can capture him ... but doubt I can bring him to you . Wherever this ' earth ' is , the journey there is obviously impractical without wormhole travel ... and only Crichton can command that . Learn what we can from him ... then execute him . Stay . We 'll guard the wormhole . Nothin 'll get through . Naw , I have a job to do . It 's over . There 's nothing more between us ? Nothing . And now , on Farscape ... We have reached the optimal departure point . D 'Argo , Scorpius and Rygel are boarding LoLah . Chiana , Sikozu and Noranti are already in a transport pod . Tell ' em we 're coming . Merry Christmas . Is there something that comes with this ? It 's big . It 's taking over your room . Oh , okay . Tell them we 're not coming . We 're gonna stay ... We 'll watch tv ... We 'll eat popcorn ... We 'll act like normal people . Captain D 'Argo is asking where you are . I gotta go . I gotta go look after Scorpius . - We should do it together . - No , you know we can 't do that together . Besides , you 've got to look after the girls . That 's not fun . It 's more fun than Mental Arts Training Camp . You know you can do with the mental discipline . Huh . Not from someone Scorpy recommends . You got the better job . What ? Rummaging around on a dead Leviathan settlement , looking for a Moya part ? Oh , that 's infinitely more thrilling . I 'm sorry , but now Chiana is inquiring where you are , Officer Sun . I 'm coming , Pilot . Well , we gotta go . - Merry Christmas . - Merry Christmas . You have all come to my dwelling to learn . Your objective is mental discipline . To focus your whole mind on a single task is a skill few ever achieve . How much did we pay for this ? The taskchairs provide access to a mindscape ... where you 'll compete with an opponent , to the point of great pain . Embrace the pain , and you shall succeed . Retreat ... and suffer the consequences . If you have any self-doubt , you have eighty microts to exit ... after which your Juxtowi crystal will be activated . Any attempt to leave and the crystal will bore through your brain . Do you think it 's worth going through with this ? Only if this guy can give us some information about that critter that attacked my family and killed my friends . The creature you descibed is neither Peacekeeper nor Scarran in origin . If it is from Tormented Space , - Katoya will know about it . - Then why won 't he just frelling tell us ... about it ? We paid him . - His price ... is completion of the course . - Excuse me . Question . Before we commit to your class ... Are you afraid that you may not be able to handle the pain ? Look , I can put up with the fairy crystal and the jammies but I need to know what else we get with the gym membership . - What the blitz is that smell ? - The stench of that frelling Charrid . No . I know that odor . Macton ... D ! You killed my wife ! - This is not your fight . - My sister ! You set me up and then you send me to prison ! Ahh , you didn 't want the truth then ... you 're not interested in it now . Get off him . Come on ! - I 'm not interested in your lies . - Ahh , let him hit me . Like he hit Lo 'Lann . Beat his own wife to death . That ends this . You okay , bro ? Macton 's a liar . - He 's a frelling liar . - He 's a frelling Peacekeeper ! A frelling Peacekeeper found us ! Let 's go , fast ... before more arrive . I am afraid it will not be permitted to leave the compound prematurely . Oh , ridiculous ! What does Katoya care ? - He 's got our currency . - Once you agree to stay , you must abide the rules . I don 't give a damn about the rules . We 're not going to stick around til a marauder lands . This sector of Tormented Space ... is forbidden to Peacekeepers unless they have received express orders from First Command . Therefore , it is highly likely that Macton is here unofficially . Alone . Unofficially , Grasshopper ? How the hell did he find us ? I 'll be sure to ask him before I kill him . Katoya will not allow you or Macton to kill each other . To Hezmana with Katoya ! Macton deserves to die ! He destroyed my family ... my wife ... - my son ... - He loves me . You mustn 't do anything . D 'Argo 's done nothing to me . I 'm fine . D 'Argo 's fine . You refuse to see him for what he really is . He is a Luxan warrior . Yes , and he cannot help but hurt you . D 'Argo will never hurt me ... and I won 't hurt him either . Good to see you , brother . Now , we 're both here . One of us must die . I wouldn 't run , even if I could . D ... I got your back on this . Grasshopper may be tellin the truth . Katoya won 't let us disrupt his class . You 'll deal with Macton when school is out . Return to the arena . Recess is over . Now that calmer minds prevail ... a demonstration . Join me . I 'm just here to watch . Everyone must participate . After the probes , land mines , corkscrews I 've had in my head ... I ain 't offering up a chunk for your mind games . - It is not a game . - It ain 't gonna happen , Miss Krabobble . Fail me . Give me " F " on my report card , but I ain 't goin in your icosahedron . Yes , of course . Proves nothing to me for you to win , Grasshopper . Begin ! Overcome the pain . Pain . See , that 's what I 'm talkin about . Pain . Try again . Do not withhold your efforts . Nor is anger a substitute for clarity . The task may be completed with a minimum of physical harm . Shall we end our demonstration ? I was just starting to enjoy the pain . Well , that was instructive . Kinda lead with your chin there . It 's not meant to be painless . It never will be painless , John . What the hell are you doin here ? Responding to D 'Argo 's death threats . He said he was coming for me . Oh ... See , I was just wonderin why you followed me to the bathroom . I don 't want to kill D 'Argo , but I won 't allow him to kill me to conceal what he did . He killed his wife . No . You killed your sister . D 'Argo murdered Lo 'Laan in a fit of hyperrage . Do you know what Luxan hyperrage is ? Yes , I do . You ... you know what a " crock " is ? D 'Argo says he didn 't do it . That 's good enough for me . You dont understand . He may not know what he did . Right . Eight cycles and change just " zoop " slips his mind . You do know that Luxan hyperrage causes blackouts ? - Is that a fact ? - Yes ... and any honest Luxan can tell you that . Please . The Charrid 's going next . I 'd love to take him on . I 'd show him some real pain . What did he say to you ? - Nothin . Forget about it . - I can 't ! Perhaps you could spend some of that energy in here . Not him ... me ! He chose me , Rygel . These Charrid frax killed billions of my people . This is not a safe place to settle grudges , Hynerian . - It is not a game . - It 's a war of wills . Where else will I get a chance at a fair fight ... where I have the advantage ? Proceed ... at your own risk . What lies did Macton tell you ? Ah , he just mentioned you were sending some threats . Yah ... it 's true . Begin . Come on . He must have told you more . I don 't want to talk about it . It 's just gonna piss you off , which is what he wants . I 'm already pissed off . What did he say ? He mentioned something ... about hyperrage causing blackouts . He said all Luxans get them . I do NOT want Macton here . I refuse to have him in this house ! You 're upsetting yourself over nothing . D 'Argo , can you hear me ? D 'Argo , can you hear me ? Blackouts during hyperrage can ... do ... happen . But I learned to control all that . So , you got the problem licked . Young Luxans are genetically violent . Their impulses , chemistry , biology ... it takes cycles to master . It 's why Luxans aren 't allowed to marry young . - And you kids ignored all that . - She said she knew I could never hurt her . Even more than that , I gave her my solemn vow , if I did ever hurt her , I would leave immediately , no questions . Well , it must have worked . You guys stayed together . Lo 'Laan was always there for me . Excuse me ... Master Jedi . It looks like Sparky 's losin more than a few brain cells in there . He 's expending a lot of energy . Is he in any real danger in there ? - Alright ... that 's the ballgame . Get him out . - It was his choice . Let 's get ' im out . He 's like ice . Keep him covered . That 's a great job . Nice of you to step in before somebody got hurt . What he did was his choice . - I hope what he learned will serve him well . - I 'll tell you what we 've learned . We 've learned not to take classes from a head job . Now we 're out of here . - Your training isn 't over . - Oh , yes it is . It 's just begun . Master ... Crichton is fine . - He 's been moved to remedial training . - Yah , I know . The Dominar is recovering as well . Yah , I wasn 't thinking about that , either . I 'm aware of that . But perhaps you should heed their example ... and attempt to remain focused on your more immediate tasks first . Please . Stay focused . D 'Argo ? D 'Argo , can you hear me ? Did I hurt you ? No . I know this upsets you . It upsets you too . We 'll get through it . If I did hurt you ... you 'd tell me , wouldn 't you ? You promised . You never hurt me , D 'Argo . But you 'd tell me if I did . Absolutely . I promise I 'd tell you . Avoid pain ... and find a way out . Try harder . Anger will not serve you . Find your path . Release your mind . Stop it ! I 'll kill you . To exert even a microt of self-control over your personal impulses is the point of the exercise . I 'm leaving . That won 't provide you with the answers you seek . What answers . What questions . Look ! I 'm not playing any more of your stupid games ... and I do not need to be reminded of my mental limitations . If I stay here , I will kill Macton ! I ... will ... kill this man ! You see ? You can control your anger . You have no limitations . Damn . Hey ! D 'Argo ? Anybody hear me ? ! This must be detention then . Hey ! It 's gettin kinda ripe in here . Macton is lying . - How do you know ? - Because he 's a Peacekeeper . Because he has to be . Look ... he 's trying to get to you and it 's working . Lo 'Lann and I were happy together . He can 't change that . I won 't let him . He 's definitely getting to you . I should have killed him . Isn 't that what you set out to do when we all left Moya ? Part of me knew that wouldn 't bring Lo 'Laan back . And another part couldn 't resist letting him know that I knew exactly where he was . Pay attention to the part that wants to kill him . He 's given you a second chance to take your revenge . - I 'm not sure I want to . - For yotz sake ! Kill him and be done with it ! - Are you real ? - Are you ? Oh , riddles . Riddle me this , riddle me that ... I have one . Why is it never just the heat , it 's the humidity ? While you 're pondering that why don 't you let me the hell out of here ? As you wish . One thing first here 's a key . You weren 't quick enough . Get a key and you may come out . I 'll say this just once . Stay away from me . Stay away from my friends . - And stop spreading your lies . - I 'm not the one lying . Oh , you 're full of dren . You 've always hated me . You 'd have hated any non-Sebacean who married your sister . I may have come to accept the marriage until you started beating her . I 'm violent ... when I choose to be . And right now , I choose not to kill you . But that could change . Really ? Well , if I chose to kill you , you 'd never see me coming . - No , I came to give you the truth ... - Dren ! The truth your blackouts stopped you from seeing ... - that poor Lo 'Laan stopped you from seeing ... - You 're full of dren . Am I lying about your hyperrage ? Am I lying about your blackouts ? - I say even a stupid Luxan should be able to see the truth . - You 're full of lies ! D 'Argo , no ! Look at you . Your uncontrollable rage . You 're violent . You really think you 'd be able to protect Lo 'Laan from that ? No ... You must have known the truth . You 've always known . Son of a ... ! - You 'd better have a key . - Katoya informs me you 've been experiencing some setbacks . He tell you who sicced that critter on my family ? That is relatively unimportant . It 's important to me . Because it was unsuccessful . That 's okay , then . I don 't need to be in here Earth is safe , everything 's fine . No , Earth is not safe . And neither are you . The Scarrans know you exist . They are already coming for you , John . You cannot run away for your whole life and I ... cannot protect you from them . Little cat a ... I don 't want you to protect me because , little cat b , you haven 't been doing such a bang-up job of that in the first place which brings us to little cat c , get me the hell out of this hole ! You are undergoing a very specific training . - Anti-Scarran training . - Well , I figured that out already . It 's not the heat ... it 's the humidity . The heat mechanism the Scarran employs is just the beginning , John . If that heat succeeds indisabling your mind 's defenses there is not fact , no fear , no deep secret that they will be unable to extract . I 'll take my chances on my own , thank you . You misunderstand my objectives , John . Without Katoya 's training , when the Scarrans find you ... they will take your wormhole knowledge and then they will kill you . I would never allow that . Ah , Scorpy-Sue ... after all we 've meant to each other , you 'd kill me first . You ... have such a limited mental capacity , John , but apparently ... an abundant will to prevail . Well , my advice to you is to use that will right here , right now . Katoya ... is the only one that can give you the tools to resist the Scarrans ! Your Crichton may not survive the training . He will . He is like me in that respect . He 'll survive . For you to have survived so long , my teachings must have been helpful . They 've saved my life ... on countless occasions . I attempted to teach you to overcome your need for a coolant suit ... and yet , you still have use of one . One can always learn more . I request ... three favors . Do I owe so many ? I did spare you from both Peacekeeper captivity and my Aurora chair . I would have survived your Aurora chair . Proceed . Firstly ... intensify Crichton 's training . Even if it kills him ? Without the training ... he will die anyway . Secondly ... Macton ... has become a distraction . - Maybe a dangerous one . - He has done nothing wrong . - I believe despite his protests , he will kill D 'Argo . - Or D 'Argo will kill him . - I will have neither here . - Still ... some preemptive action ... could be called for . Third ? Information about a species I have no knowledge of . This ... species ... has recently attacked Crichton . May I ... describe it for you ? John ... you okay ? Come and help me . Get this thing open . That didn 't budge it , did it ? It 's gonna need at least a Qualta or ... a pulse grenade . Here . I brought you something to drink . - Thanks . - Listen , John ... this is really doing my head in . I 've been thinkin about killing Macton for half my life . That 's a hell of a thing , man . Look , you get me outta here , I 'll ... - ... kill him for you , all right ? - No , no , I can kill him . Frell knows I 've wanted to , but , uh ... what if Lo 'Laan lied ? She lied about the blackouts . Then perhaps not knowing or remembering ... I hit my wife . Don 't go there . - That 's Macton talkin . - I am there , John . If that 's possible ... - and more ... - D 'Argo ... many things are possible . Macton is just filling you with possibilities . What Lo 'Laan did ... and that 's what matters . Whatever she did , she did for you . That 's what 's important . - And that means something . - That means ... that it 's possible I killed the woman ... who loved me more than life . Probably won 't be apparent from my actions , but I really do have a great deal of respect for your work here . I 'm sure many warriors have been made great from your teachings . I just won 't be one of them . Do not sell yourself short . Mental strength is , uh ... well , it 's not my strength . I know that . It 's why I 've come to you . Your mind is troubled . Whose isn 't ? Can you help me ... find an answer ? What would you like to know ? What kind of monster I really am . This need not be difficult . But it probably will be . Where do we start ? What would you like to see ? I ... uh ... I don 't want to see that . Stay focused . I realize this is difficult . I know this upsets you . I know this upsets you too . We 'll get through it . You 're upsetting yourself over nothing . D 'Argo ? D 'Argo ? Can you hear me ? Hyperrage is a natural function of Luxan physiology . But it 's a function to be controlled , not flaunted . - Not to be used against someone you love . - Can you hear me ? - Did you use it against her ? - I don 't know . - But you want to know . - Can you hear me ? - No ... - But you came here to know . - Can you hear me ? - No ! I hit her . Did I hurt you ? No . B ... but you 'd tell me ? Promise me you would , please . You never hurt me , D 'Argo . You promised you 'd tell me . Why didn 't you tell me ? Don 't you know how much I loved you ? Yes . Sorry to interrupt , Master ... Ka D 'Argo time to revisit your memories . What have you done with Katoya ? I refocused his energies . Hello , sister . Welcome home ... the scene of the crime . The scene of your many crimes . D 'Argo , no ! Just like before . That never happened . Go ahead ! Hit her ! Never a problem for you when she was alive . No . I never meant to . Never meant to do this ? Or this ? Or this ? - Hy ... hy ... hyperrage . - It was you . Because you couldn 't control yourself . Because you were weak ! Recognize this place ? Your cell . Not here . Not now . - Not like this . - Where else ? This is where you belong . You 're a wild beast . A mad dog . You 've earned these chains ... and worse . How does it feel to be helpless ? Defenseless ? This is what you did to Lo 'Laan . This is what your rage felt like . Rage that destroyed a beautiful girl . Ahh ! Gotcha . I didn 't kill Lo 'Laan . No . No , you did much worse . Your violence ... drove her to her death . No ... You beat her beyond her capacity to endure any more . Oh , no ... But I got there first . I doctored the scene . Provided the evidence ... that put you in prison to rot forever . Don 't try to resist . It 's my gift to you , D 'Argo . Your own hyperrage in a place where you can rot in it forever . Just you and your hyperrage , for eternity . Focus . Focus . No ! You 're lying . Every word you 've said is a lie . No ... You beat her and you killed her . You know the truth . You never knew Lo 'Laan ... and you knew nothing about love . I know what Lo 'Laan went through for our love . I wish I could have loved her half as well . Oh ... you loved her to death ! You do not have this power ! Lo 'Laan told me I do have power ... over my hyperrage , and it 's more than enough to control you in here . You cannot kill me . Not in here . I have no intention of killing you . I loved my wife . But you wouldn 't know that . You didn 't know Lo 'Laan . I did . She could have left me for my failings . Maybe she should have , but I know this ... she would never have left her son ... without a mother . So I want you to show me your memories . Tell me ... why ... you killed ... Lo 'Laan . Trying to save her from you . D 'Argo will be dishonorably discharged , jailed for as long as you need . But he 's done nothing wrong ! He has done everything wrong . You 'll thank me for this , sister . No , I won 't let you ! It was your fault . She attacked me . My reflexes took control . My Peacekeeper training . It was over before I realized . It 's not the truth . Not the whole truth . She was beaten . It was your fault she died . You had to pay . I had to make you pay . I had to make it look like you 'd done it in a fit of hyperrage . Had to make sure you were blamed . You okay ? Fine . You want me to drive ? No . I 'm fine . If you were fine you 'd have killed Macton instead of leaving him there . He 's trapped in a coma with his own nightmares . Killing him would have been merciful . I 'm not that enlightened . So tell me , John ... were you able to obtain the key ? Incidently ... that creature that attacked you on earth , it might interest you to know it is called a skreeth . Apparently ... it can communicate telepathically over vast distances . Yah ... Katoya give you that ? If it did map Earth 's location , it may well have passed on that information . Who 'd it pass it on to ? Grayza , almost certainly . So the Peacekeepers know where Earth is . May know . Would Grayza go there ? Eventually , perhaps . Grayza does not want Earth . Grayza wants you . Why do I always attract the psychos ? Hey man , you sure you 're okay ? Yah , I 'll be fine . I 've got things on my mind . Things I 've done . Things I can 't take back .

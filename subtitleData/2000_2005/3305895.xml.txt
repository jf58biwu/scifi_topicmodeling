 Despite all the warnings , she was smoking in bed , fell asleep . Bad move . And the fire begins . It 's showtime . Don 't worry , ma 'am ! I 'm here to save you ! Keep those people back ! This is an emergency ! Don 't you dare die on me ! Breathe , damn it , breathe ! She 's going to make it ! What the ... ? Damn ! Though it may be hard to believe a single biology professor making in excess of $ 17,500 a year could find time to grade your first biology research papers , I did . As you can see , there was a shocking statistical anomaly : Pretty much all of you got A 's . congratulate yourselves . I have a good feeling about this group . And I think the parade of A 's will continue to the end of the semester . So much for the bell curve . Bell curves suck ! - Mr . Kane ? - Dr . Kane ? There seems to be a mistake here . My brother and I each got a c - . c - . Me , too . Allow me to share something with the entire class . As I was grading papers , I came across two gems , both entitled " cells are Bad . " Both with just one paragraph , which I unfortunately committed to memory . " cells are Bad . " My uncle lives in a cell . " lt 's 10 by 12 and he has to read the same boring magazine every day . " The end . " You 're talking about our papers , aren 't you , Dr. Kane ? Yes , I am . And although my standards are nowhere near where they used to be I couldn 't put an A on those beauties . I hope you understand . - Sure . - Yeah , okay . Okay , let 's get back to work at the periodic table , which ... . A meteor ? Where ? Route 89A . Yeah , I got it . Rest assured , I will be there . Okay , ' bye . How does it look , Professor ? It 's tight . Really , really tight , Nadine . But not too tight . You just don 't have the points . Sorry . Don 't take it too hard . Geology 's tougher than people think . Are you sure ? could you check again ? I need this credit to get into nursing school . Nursing school ? Wouldn 't you prefer a different profession ? One where lives were not dependent on you ? Actually , what I want to be is Miss Arizona . But my pageant consultant says nursing school will impress the judges . They 'll think I want to help people- - Ready for lunch ? Or have you already eaten ? I 'm just concluding a teacher-student conference with Nadine . Harry , your dedication to your job is an inspiration to us all . Regrettably , I have a prior lunch engagement with Professor Kane . We 'll discuss your extra credit later . cheer up . Let me grab my stuff . Where are you taking me ? - A meteor hit last night . - That 's what that was . As Glen canyon 's representative for the U.S. Geological Survey I have to check it out . I 'm taking you in case I have to do something scientific . Then we eat . You 're with the USGS ? I signed up over the Internet . Or were you on a cheerleader site and accidentally got linked to the USGS site ? Something like that . Watch it . Take it easy . That 's my baby . Take it easy . come on ! Be careful ! Who 's going to pay for the damage to my goddamn car ? I told you , we don 't do that . It . ' s force majeure . Force majeure , my ass ! That car 's a classic ' 73 Buick Riv . Who are you ? Harry Block , United States Geological Survey . My secretary , Ira Kane . We 're here to investigate the meteor if that is what it is . Of course it is . It almost blew up my car . I 'm still fuzzy on why you were here at night . With Betty Lou here . I was practicing for my fireman 's exam , which started seven minutes ago . So I 'd appreciate it if you 'd let me go . So you and the blonde found the meteor ? Yeah , I found it . It bounced my car 200 feet in the air . - can I go ? - Bob , get him out of here . Don 't leave town . Well , Sheriff , is this the point of penetration ? Yeah . It punched through into a cavern about 80 feet down . Now that 's a hole ! Damn it ! Next time , you carry the case . You 're the USGS representative . That responsibility comes with the badge . Oh , my God . Look at that . I believe we 've located the target . Two big smiles , fellas . cheese ! Okay , hold it up now . - Got it . - It 's really hot . I 'll hold you up . Show a little more nightstick . Look at these jackasses . Muscle pose . Give me big smiles ! Looking good . At ease , gentlemen ! The feds are here . Feds ? What feds ? Who let you down here ? Let 's not get combative . The USGS and local law enforcement have a long history of cooperation . We 're just here to get some scientific samples . If that 's okay . Yeah , sure . We got all the photographic evidence we need . - carry on . - Thanks . Keep up the good work . Wow . It just hit last night and it has stuff growing on it . could be cave moss . After just a few hours ? That 's peculiar . Let 's get a sample and get out of here . It 's bleeding . It 's a rock that bleeds . Now that 's really peculiar . Let 's bag it . I don 't know if this USGS gig is all it 's cracked up to be . I mean , it pads out my résumé , but am I growing as a person ? Am I growing as a Division 3 women 's volleyball coach ? You going to do that spectro-thingy test ? Spectrograph . Yeah , I will do a spectroscopic analysis . Your résumé will shine . I got to get to the game . Let me know if you find anything . Ira , are you sure you can handle this by your lonesome ? All right . That 's impossible . Ten base pairs . That can 't be . come on , ladies ! Look alive up here ! Tina ! When Lisa goes for the spike , you have to cover the line ! Lisa ! Two hands , okay ? Two hands ! God gave you two hands for a reason ! Big news . The most amazing thing . The meteor samples are teeming with one-celled organisms . Their metabolic rates are off the charts . They 're dividing at an incredible rate . Almost exponential . Their DNA has ten base pairs . Ten base pairs . That 's good to know . Harry , the DNA of all earth life has only four base pairs . come on , ladies ! Look alive ! Harry these are organisms from another world . They 're aliens . Is the Nobel Prize paid in instalments or a lump sum , like the lottery ? Let 's not get ahead of ourselves . I 'm not . I 'm concerned about the potential tax consequences . - Why in here ? - l just want to be cautious . Our discovery . I 'm all tingly . Wow . I 'm no biologist , but how many cells do single-celled organisms have ? If we want to be big important scientists , you have to act the part . Take a look . There are multi-cellular organisms in there . I know . - They weren 't there before . - They snuck in . No , there was no sneaking in . It 's too amazing . It 's like they 're evolving . They 're growing . Growing into more complex organisms . It 's evolution . Nobel , here we come . But it 's 200 million years worth in just a few hours . That 's fast . You have no idea . Get ready ! On my signal ! Go ! Recruit , wake up . Wake up ! Go ! - The hose ! This thing here ! - Sorry . Move it ! Wayne , go ! come on ! These things happen , buddy . There 's another test in six months . Six months ? I can 't wait six months ! At least you have the pool gig at the country club . Great . Thanks a lot . Drive careful . I got it. I do this . Looks like we have visitors . class , since this is our first field trip , I want you to obey some simple rules . Dirt . Nice footwear . Perfect for spelunking . Now don 't touch anything . Don 't move anything . Don 't even breathe unless we say . Wear your protective gloves at all times . Why do we have to do this ? Field experience . The meat and potatoes of geology . - Will this be on the final ? - Yes . - Officer , nice to see you . - What 's up , Professor ? We came to pick up the rock . Pick it up ? What ? Orders from the USGS . They want it under controlled conditions . It 's very technical . Oh , technical stuff . It 's technical . Okay . Go right ahead . - We 'll just haul it right out . - Sure . Deke and Danny ? Remember what we talked about ? You 're in charge of hoisting . Get the winch to the hole . Fellas ? Stop nodding , and stare at me for a second , okay ? Focus . - You understand what I want you to do ? - Yeah . Go do it . Ira , I 'm picking up a heavy creepy vibe here . Yeah , a lot has changed . class , I know these look like mushrooms , but refrain from eating them . It smells disgusting . Nadine , sometimes science stinks . It 's the game we play , baby . Rotten egg smell . Hydrogen sulfide , right ? With ammonia and methane . It 's converting the atmosphere . Look at all this rudimentary plant life . It 's amazing . Not to get all girly here , but I feel something wiggling around my toes . The ground does seem to be moving . Flatworms . Millions of them ! Yuck ! Barely 18 hours and we already have flatworms . - Look . - There they are ! Hi , Dr. Kane ! - l almost went down on that one ! - Awesome . come here , little buddy . I won 't hurt you . You didn 't hurt it . You killed it . The oxygen must have killed it . It must need its own atmosphere to live . Grab a specimen jar . We 'll scoop some atmosphere in there with them . It took us two billion years to do what they did in a couple of days . Those germs are the embodiment of the American dream . I 'm sorry to interrupt , Professor Block . But I was wondering if I 'm correct in assuming that that field trip fulfilled any of my missing credit assignments ? Nadine , you are a very very smart girl . If you would just focus . Professor , the little wiggly worm things are breaking . Ira , look . It 's not breaking . It 's splitting . It 's mitosis . That 's how they reproduce . No sex ? No time for sex . Bummer . - They 're splitting again . - Put it away . We call no one , we tell no one . This is our secret . What about the government ? They usually get involved . - No government. I know those people . - You do ? This is our discovery . We must maintain absolute control . We have to do more research and check our findings . Document everything . Wayne ? What 's this ? That would be an all-cotton towel , sir . I believe it 's a Fieldcrest . It 's a damp towel . What is a damp towel doing on my chaise ? - Let me take care of this for you . - You should , as pool manager . If anyone knows what to do about the dampness on my chair , it 's you . " You know what to do with the towels because you 're the pool boy . " What the hell ? Where did you guys come from ? You 're dead now . When I checked the samples this morning I found three different subspecies . They 're evolving so quickly God knows what we 'll find when we get back . - Please tell me there 's an air show today . - Damn . Shit . can I help you ? Harry Block , Ira Kane . United States Geological Society . We 're doing some important research . This is our site . Not anymore . You 're not on the list . What ? We come here all the time . Well this is not a nightclub . Why don 't you take it somewhere else . I know my constitutional rights . You can 't tell- - Harry ! Maybe you can call your superior , we can have a word with him ? I have a Harry Block and an Ira Kane here- - Punk . - Talk nice to the white man . - I 'll whup his ass . White man doesn 't like to be yelled at . Ira Kane ? The Ira Kane ? I 've looked forward to this for a long time . You bastard ! You 're history ! You 're done ! Get his gun ! Take it easy ! Okay , they 're going up . You 're responsible for the worst month of my life ! - What the hell was that about ? - l don 't know . Drive down to the command tent . They 're expecting you . Go . That guy had me in diapers for over a month ! What the hell was that ? - General Woodman 's expecting you . - Russell Woodman ? What an unexpected surprise . For me , too . I didn 't know we were on a hugging basis . Same old Ira Kane . And you are ? Harry Block , this is Gen. Russell Woodman , head of U.S. Army Research . You two know each other ? Ira used to work for me , right ? I worked with you , actually . You worked in Army Research in the Pentagon ? All this time I thought you were just a schoolteacher . No . How did you find out about this ? You leave the Pentagon , you don 't call , you don 't write . We like to keep tabs on our prodigal sons . You tapped my phone ? No . We 're not the KGB . We 've been monitoring your computer . His computer ? All those girls in the photos are over 18 . Yes , I 'm sure . I should have figured , Russell . You should 've known better than to keep something this big from us . And the cDc . Just in time . Ira , this is Allison Reed , senior researcher in epidemiology at the cDc . Nice underwear . A garter belt ? At a day function ? I can do it . Thank you . I 'm okay . Dr. Kane . I 'd heard about your recklessness but you are way out of line on this one . Didn 't you realise how dangerous the situation could have become ? Nice to meet you , too . No need to play the blame game , Allison . No harm , no foul . We 're all appreciative about the discovery made by Dr. Kane and Mr. Black . Block . Block . I 'm sorry . The confirmation that life exists outside this planet- - Would be the greatest scientific discovery of our time . - Yes , actually . - Yes , it would . You have my word you 'll be kept in the loop from this point on . You son of a bitch . Kept in the loop ? We are the loop . We won 't cut you out but we need to take control . We 're following protocol , Ira . You remember protocol , don 't you ? I have some protocol right here for you , come and get it . Look ! The fact is , this research must continue under government control . We 've already secured the area . We 're constructing an airlock and a state-of-the-art field research facility . So there 's not a whole lot for the science department of Glen canyon community college to do here . Did you catch that condescending tone ? We are following well-established federal guidelines- - Please , don 't pull this crap . We deserve to be here . You deserve to be here ? You 're lucky anybody 's ever let you near a science laboratory again . You 're a disgrace , and a dangerous one at that . Lieutenant , show these men out . This is horseshit . It 's not over . You 're in for a fight , Russell . Would you stop following me ? Thank you . We won 't bend over and take this ! Fruit basket for Russell Woodman ! Happy holidays , General ! cute . Dr. Kane , are you asking me to bar the federal government from involvement in a discovery as significant as this one ? No . We 're asking you to ensure the local scientists who made the discovery continue to play a significant role . They 've kept us out for almost two weeks . We put our lives on the line to find these little guys , Your Majesty . We just want to be there for them as they grow up . We were first team at the meteor site and all the initial testing was done in our lab . The facilities at Glen canyon community college are a joke . They weren 't a joke when I went there , General . Your Honour , if the court would allow me to depose Dr. Kane . Depose me ? We think your past is very relevant , Dr. Kane . These issues speak directly to his competence as a scientist . Dr. Kane , you were a top-level researcher at USAMRID from ' 94 to ' 97 were you not ? That 's correct . You were summarily dismissed in the summer of 1997 . Any idea why ? My services were no longer required ? So your firing had nothing to do with an experimental anthrax vaccine you developed and administered to 140,000 U.S. soldiers in May of that year ? I see where you 're going with this . It may have been a factor . You need to ask the Joint chiefs of Staff . I 'll do that . For now , can you tell me what happened to the soldiers who were inoculated ? None of them got anthrax , if that 's what you 're asking . What did they get ? Well , as with any new vaccine there were certain side effects associated with- - could you be more specific ? It 's very technical . I 'd hate to waste the court 's time with it . Humour me . Some debilitating stomach cramps . Severe diarrhoea . Memory loss . Yes . Go on . Any more symptoms ? Partial facial paralysis , temporary blindness , drooling bleeding gums , erectile dysfunction uncontrollable flatulence . I think that 's it . One more question . Do you remember what the soldiers called this illness ? They called it the Kane Madness . Keep your head up . You know she wants to give you some . Were you even in that courtroom ? Getting barbecued like babyback ribs ? It 's all foreplay . We 've been hit . Forget the foreplay . We just got screwed . - Empty . - This is bad . This is very , very bad . Damn it ! I don 't care who they are . Stealing is stealing ! They took the rock , the samples , all the little wormy critters . All the data 's gone . The JPEG files , the DNA sequences . They cleaned us out . - I 'm calling the cops . - The cops ? They are the cops ! Then what ? Let me ask you something . How come you get to be a colonel and I 'm just a private ? I was a colonel . And you obviously served your country with distinction . consider yourself lucky . The penalty for impersonating an officer is five years in prison . Maybe for you , white boy . Me , they hang . colonels first . We been out here for twelve hours . My toe is starting to hurt . Stop it . - Just act like you belong . - Don 't worry , I got this . - Pick up that butt , soldier . - Sorry , sir . - And tuck that shirt in . - Yes , sir . Get the door . Thank you , Private . Don 't get used to this . Look at that . Enjoy your lunch , gentlemen . Your girlfriend , 11 : 00 . Darn it . The woman 's a menace . Testing , one , two . This is DJ Harry Block here and I 'm an Aquarius . Stop. I can hear you . Don 't snap at me , unless you want an angry Solid Gold dancer on your hands . Lieutenant ? Who 's that ? I don 't know . I don 't have anything on my schedule . Maybe it 's the guys from Sector 12 doing a nocturnal specimen run . You know how those guys are . This place has changed . can you believe this ? Harry , look at that . Our little babies are growing up . Three weeks , it 's already like a rain forest in here . Looks like the kitchen from my first apartment . Harry check that guy out . Is it coming or going ? That tree just ate it . Everything here seems to be food for something else , so let 's stay off the menu . You got that right . come here , look at these little things . cool . Snag one . Snag one ? Yeah . Snag one and put it in the bucket . I 've seen this movie . The black dude dies first . You snag it . Don 't be scared . We came for a specimen , now snag one . He won 't hurt you , he 's turned the other way . He 's eating . come on . come on , my little red lobster . come on , my sexy little crustacean . Look at that backside . Theatre-in-the-round . That 's the kind of trunk space you want in a late model car . Who does that remind you of ? I have no idea what you 're talking about . She 's been throwing it at you enough . - Dr . Reed ? - Bull 's-eye . Excuse me . Dr. Reed ? Did you authorise a walk-through ? No . Why ? You should probably take a look at something . Here . That 's the kind of rump you 'd like to roast . Kind of mother you 'd like to butter . That is a nice image . And I appreciate your assumption that there is an actual sexual human being underneath all Dr. Reed 's deep-seated neuroses ... - ... but I don 't think so . - What ? I think she is a humourless ice queen . That 's just a cover , don 't you know that ? All she needs is a good humping . Oh , Ira . Ira We have to get a piece of the asteroid . And cut that out , it disturbs me . Don 't do that behind my back like that . - I 'm not doing it . - cut it out . I 'm just walking . Let 's bag that and get the hell out of here . I 'm ready when you are , colonel . This disco suit is making me chafe . Shoo , fly . Hold it . Right there . Dr. Reed . Nice to see you again . We were just leaving . You realise you 're in violation of the judge 's orders. I could have you arrested . Talk about violations . What about our lab ? Anyone have a can of Raid ? - What are you talking about ? - You stole our computer files , our samples . - l didn 't steal anything . - Your buddies did . - They cleaned us out . - No , we didn 't . Damn right . You 've been trying to grab credit on our discovery from the beginning . We just want what 's rightfully ours . credit has nothing to do with it . I 'm concerned with public safety . - Is any of this true , Flemming ? - Absolutely not . - Something 's in my suit . - You 're not going to believe him ! Something 's in my suit . - What ? - There 's something in my suit ! That 's impossible , it 's sealed ! The fly ! There 's a fly in my suit ! Take off your helmet ! Turn up the oxygen ! It 'll kill it ! Do you see it ? Look . Do you see it ? No . - You 're all right . Who 's the man ? - You are . - No , you 're the man ! - I 'm the man . - You 're the man ! - Okay . Oh , God . It 's in me ! For the love of everything holy , get this thing out of me ! You 'll be okay ! cut him open and get it . cut me open ? There goes your christmas gift , you Judas ! It 's moving down his leg ! - What do we do ? - Might have to amputate . Don 't take my leg ! Don 't let them take my leg ! Anything else you can do ? He thinks he 's an athlete . Doctor , look . It 's heading for his testicles . Take it ! Take the leg ! Wait ! It 's going the other way . Give me some forceps . I might be able to catch it in his colon . - How will you go in ? - Rectally . I 'll get the lubricant . - No time . - There 's always time for lubricant ! Flip him ! Okay , here we go . - You have to try to relax . - It 'll be okay . I 'll shove this gurney up your ass , see if you relax ! cheek spreader . I 'm going in . - Don 't clench . - You 're so brave . - A little more . - No more ! A little deeper . No deeper ! Squeeze my hand . - Almost there . - Open up . - Breathe . - I 'm breathing . - Almost there . - You 're there ! Got it ! It 's over . It just died . Don 't you ever do that again ! Those forceps were like this . You took it like a man . You did great. can we get you anything ? Ice cream . I 'd like an ice cream , please . What flavour ? It doesn 't matter . It 's for my ass . Man ! Now I 'm a Hawaiian warrior ? I 'm thinking seriously about moving . Maybe to California . Start over . Because of the fireman thing ? Big deal . You flunked out . You know how many times I 've flunked in my life ? A ton . Pool boy , you watering down the mai tais ? No , sir . But let me fix you something special . Because you 're nothing but a big , fat monkey turd . Excuse me ? Drink 's almost ready . Here you go . That should tide you over . " Don 't forget , folks That 's what you get , folks " For makin ' whoopee " Damn it ! That 's going to stain . Barry ! Barry , where are you ? I can 't see you ? Where are you ? I 'm down here , my pet , by the water . Something just ate Barry cartwright ! That 's too bad . I don 't get it . How does someone with your background credentials , and talent end up like you ? Thank you . Your partner could have died . What were you thinking ? I was desperate . I 've been exiled out here in Arizona for five years watching the world pass me by and this amazing discovery falls into my lap . It 's my ticket out of here . I don 't suppose you would understand that . No , how could I ? I 'm just a humourless ice maiden in need of a good humping . You heard that ? Loud and clear . Don 't think you know so much about me . You don 't . I 'm sure I don 't . Thank you for not calling the cops . - Be careful ! - Stop being such a baby . We 've seen that car before . No more bran for me . Hey , girls . cut it out . It 's the meteor guy . What 's in the bag , your blow-up doll ? No . I 've got something you 're really going to like . - What happened to you ? - Shut up . You guys teach here ? I was thinking about taking some classes but I decided to hit the job market early and get a jump start on things . can we help you ? A guy got killed at my country club last night . A real douchebag , but that just doesn 't make it right . It was an animal attack . Isn 't that something ? Happened by the water hazard on the 4th green . The lady he was banging saw it . We chased this sucker on the fairway , then it died in a sand trap . It just died ? How ? Like it was choking to death . You know ? Stopped breathing . It 's like nothing I ever saw before . I thought you guys might want to see it . Jill , you 've got some kind of infestation here . You have a serious bug problem . Jill ? There 's something in your closet . Open the door , Grace . Me ? It 's your house . When did you guys get a dog ? We don 't have a damn dog . I don 't think that 's a dog . It 's like some kind of rodent . Or a muskrat or a pig . How did it get in here ? It doesn 't look too healthy , does it ? Well , it 's frightened . He can barely breathe , he 's so scared . come on , cutie pie . Don 't be afraid . come on . That 's a good boy- - 911 ? What the hell is that thing ? Thanks . Pick me up in an hour . No , two . Well , an hour and a half would be good . Hi . Do you have any messages for me ? Two single beds , please . We 're fighting . come on . I 'm tired . I 've had two hours of sleep. I need a shower . They 're spreading . You mean the golf course ? Woodman sent a team out there two hours ago . Too bad you missed the 5-foot amphibian that 's lying dead in my lab . They 're adapting . We have got to shut it down . You 're overreacting . We can handle this . I used to be arrogant like you . We 're both aware of what that led to . Take me seriously , Allison . I do take you seriously . Then talk to Woodman , because he won 't listen to me . We have to kill these things while we still can . All right . I 'll talk to him , but I can 't promise anything . Thank you . Just one more thing . could you ever be attracted to me ? - ' Bye , Ira . - Just food for thought . She 's mine . I 've been an adjunct professor for almost four years . I 'm hoping this whole alien brouhaha will net me an honorary doctorate somewhere . You going to finish that bacon ? Yeah , I am. I ordered it , didn 't I ? So , about the coaching . Girls volleyball ? Do you ever get to see them take showers ? Yeah , all the time . Sometimes I shower with them . You 're kidding , right ? - So ? - She 's going to talk to Woodman . Thank goodness . I 'm okay . So , level with me , fellows . Is there some sort of alien attack happening here ? We don 't know . could I borrow your cream ? Hi , Denise . Hello , Ira . Still setting the world on fire ? That 's Ira 's ex over there sitting with the cop . Why the police escort ? You 're not under arrest , are you ? Funny . This is Sam . He 's about to make detective . I know Sam . Maybe you can look into what happened to my missing shirts . Did I tell you ? She left with two or three of my shirts . See what I mean ? I 'm not up on the law , but is it against the law to walk out of someone 's house with what they own ? You want your shirt ? Seriously , take it . You must be cold , right ? Is that it ? Why should I wear a shirt that 's yours ? calm down . It 's amazing how many women just open their shirt to him . He 'll let you borrow the shirt for just today . Right , Professor ? 10-99 , we have a code 12-72 over in Valley Vista ... . 12-72 ? That 's an animal attack . 10-99 responding . - Got to go , babe . - Now ? They 're calling . Be careful out there . You 'll take care of the check , right ? I want those shirts back , Denise . You have to admit , this animal attack has kind of an ominous feel , doesn 't it ? - check it out ? - check it out . All right ! Looks like we 're under the microscope , so let 's be subtle . No cowboy stuff , okay ? - No problem . - Professionals . Officer Johnson . What are you doing here ? We heard about the attack . Part of our job is to ascertain if there 's any health risk . No . Not this time . Forget about it . - You didn 't touch it , right ? - That would be a serious no-no . - You did ? He touched it . - He shouldn 't have touched it . - What do we do ? - l don 't know . Okay . Why don 't you come in and take a look ? I 'll be checking things out around here in this vicinity . This dog is all ass . Jeez . Ira , look at this , man . He would have come from in here , right ? It 's just used for storage and access under the house . Looks like he crawled through the dirt . Hey , guys . I was conducting a parameter check , and there 's something you better see . You liked that thing , you 're going to love this . What is it ? What is it ? Great googa-mooga ! What did I tell you ? They 're crawling out . They 're trying to breathe in our atmosphere . Fortunately , they haven 't been able to adapt yet . - l think I know how these things got here . - How ? This entire area is just a honeycomb of caves and old mine shafts . I believe the Moenave cave system starts a few miles away west of the golf course . It runs into the foothills , continues to the Kaibab Plateau and goes right into Lake Powell . Our cave is smack dab in the middle of the system . It 's all connected . - could you repeat that ? - I 'm impressed . Beneath this calm , sexy exterior beats the heart of a true scientist . That one 's moving . What the hell is it doing ? I think it 's trying to breathe . That 's like a big loogie ! Mazel tov . It 's a boy . It 's oxygen tolerant . It 's flying away . Is that a bad thing ? Only if you 're a human being . You know how I hate shopping . - You need something for Thanksgiving . - l have enough clothes . I think that colour is great on you . I think this may be the place . Ever used one of these before ? Just ' cause I 'm a teacher don 't make me a pussy . Ladies , there 's a flying extraterrestrial in the store. can we focus ? I 'm in here . Just a minute . Just a second , please ! I said , just a second , bitch . How would you like me to scratch out your eyes ? Here , birdy-birdy-birdy-birdy-birdy ! If I was a giant , nasty alien bird in a department store , where would I be ? - Lingerie . - Not you , the bird . Lingerie . Help ! You go low . I 'm going high . We 'll never find this damn thing . I lost him ! How do you lose a 20-foot bird in a mall ? I don 't know . What do we do now ? Wayne . I think we 've established that " ca-caw " and " tookie-tookie " don 't work . Right . Sorry . So what do you say , Ira ? Pack it in ? Step back . I 'm going to shoot him . Stand down . I 'll kill this one myself . Give me a chance . I 'm communicating here . Wayne , please stop . You are embarrassing me . It 's working . Sing . Rub some funk on it . Here he comes ! You grab the girl , I 'll get the bird . All right ! Nice shot ! I am so sorry. I swear to God I will never shoplift again . Good . So what do you want , light meat or dark ? You have to ask ? It 's dead now . I 'm standing at the edge of the Valley Vista housing community where just below me are dozens of giant , odd-looking , dead creatures . We should stress that , to this point , we have had no official word from- - This ugly tentacle came out of the ground and tried to grab my private parts . I batted it away . It got my hand . There is anxiety and confusion in the Glen Canyon area . We 're outside the state capitol building awaiting comment from the Governor concerning the nature and origin of these extraordinary creatures . Governor Lewis , this way . can someone tell me why I was not informed that we have aliens crawling all over my beloved state ? Right now , 400 media vultures are camped outside my office . They know more about this than I do . I should throw the bunch of you into prison . Not the cushy federal place with jumpsuits . State prison , with crotch binders . I 'm sorry , but there were earlier security breaches by Dr. Kane and his team . Wait a minute . No , no . Excuse me . That 's not exactly true , Gen. Woodman . I believe the Governor 's question was directed at me . Put a plug in it ! I 'm not interested in bureaucratic crapola . I want to know how bad this thing is . It 's bad , Governor . According to the new ground sensors and satellite thermal scans they indicate a potential problem . I can 't read this . What kind of problem ? Someone take this bag of snakes and lay them out straight . Allow me . - And you are ? - Dr . Allison Reed . Carla ? Would you mind ? The red markings indicate the growth of the alien ecosystem . Unless we act immediately , we will lose Glen canyon in three days . Great merciful Christ . In a week , the rest of Arizona . Then , the entire southwest . In two months , the United States officially belongs to them . And we are extinct . You must be shitting me ! Admit it . You 're glad to see us . Yes , I am. call the MP 's . Have them arrested . We just blew a giant alien bird out of a store . We 're covering up your mess . I 'm Dr. Ira Kane , chairman of the science department Glen canyon community college . This is my associate . Harry Block , adjunct professor of geology . Voted for you . Wayne Gray . I took some chemistry in high school . You two are the original discoverers of the phenomena , correct ? Yes , and they 're also responsible for the mess we 're in now . Here we go . They broke into the contained area , breaching security procedures . Disseminating the alien organisms outside the secured area . Liar , liar , pants on fire ! criminal charges are in order ! - This is bullshit ! - It is not ! Shut up all of you ! Listen . My state is being overrun by aliens . Now you 're supposed to be experts . I want to know , and quick : How will you deal with this ? This is an outline of the infected area as of this afternoon . My plan is to evacuate everyone from within five miles of the perimeter . You 're talking about 10,000 people . Yes , sir . We evacuate , make it safe then burn the alien menace the hell out of there . With what ? With napalm . Lots and lots of napalm . Napalm ? Why don 't you just nuke them ? What about nukes ? Nobody 's dropping an H-bomb on my state . All this talk about napalm and burning makes me nervous . And we don 't know how they 'd react to such an attack on a cellular level . Governor , it 's time for a military solution . This will work . General ? Sorry to interrupt . You better take a look at this . What ? You called me out for this ? Sir , one of the creatures just destroyed video four . What 's going on down there ? My God . They 've evolved into primates . That 's a face for radio . They took out six and seven . All the monitors are down . Well , that can 't be good . That 's the elevator . We have no personnel down there . They breached the air lock . The fuzzy no-nose chimp ? call for backup . We need backup ! They 're coming through the elevator ! They 're coming through the elevator ! - cover the elevator ! - Give me a sidearm ! Okay , just stay behind me ! Get off me ! I want to see ! Be prepared to fire . It 's empty , sir . The Governor ! Don 't shoot ! Help ! Do something ! Hold your fire . You 'll get someone killed . Nice shot . I 'll take that now . You have my full support to do whatever you need to do however much firepower it takes . Melt the place down to beaded glass , if that 's what it takes . Get these hellish creazoids out of my state ! Thank you , Governor . I 'll be ready to go by noon tomorrow . Good , sir . - Where 've you two been ? - Just getting out of the way- - Get me out of here . Science project is over . I want you and your people gone . Soldier , escort these men out . Don 't you have work to do ? You are such an asshole . When a woman expresses anger , it 's often because- - Shut up , Flemming . Okay. I know where the car is . Wipe my ass , too . Hey , guys ! Got room for one more ? Hell , yeah . Who wants to be deputy director of the cDc , anyway ? The real money 's in the private sector . - Are you sure about this ? - Oh , yeah . Listen , it may not seem like much now but I got your research files and original samples . So if we survive this , you guys will get the credit . Thank you . - It 's nothing . - Let me get it . No , I got it . Sorry . Excuse me . We haven 't been formally introduced . I 'm Wayne Gray . I 'm kind of with him . That 's cool . Buckle up , Allison . We 're rolling . Oh , my goodness ! Facilities are being provided for you and your families . Please move in an orderly fashion . They 're going to blow up the whole town . Hey ! Hold on ! Where the hell you going ? We need to clear this area , people . For your own safety , evacuate immediately . Professor Kane ! Arizona ! It 's going down , baby ! This may not be the best time to be drinking . I was your first . We discovered you in that cave . You were scared and alone . It was just you , me and Harry . Those were good times . So , why not level with me now ? You can trust me . Just talk to me . Tell me the secret . Tell me the answer . Tell me how to kill you . You are losing it , pal . What is that stuff anyway ? Some of the original liquid material from inside the meteor . - Why hasn 't it evolved like the rest ? - l don 't know . Maybe being refrigerated ? Being in an airtight case , nothing to metabolise with . But we 've still no clue ... . When did you start smoking ? Not much of a point to clean living anymore . They react to fire like it was Miracle-Gro . Fire . The organisms were dormant in space . They hit Earth 's atmosphere and bam ! Heat . Fire . That 's the catalyst . So if a tiny match catalyses this stuff like this what 's a ton of napalm going to do ? So much for the military option . Better call that dick general . - That 's a lot of napalm . - Yes , it is . We 're going to blow those creatures straight to hell . We 'll flush them out along the mine shafts then mop up the edges as they run trying to escape the flames . Excuse me , sir . There 's an urgent call from Dr. Reed . She says she has important information about the mission . Oh , really ? Well , unfortunately , I 'm not available . Anything more ? No , sir . He blew me off. can you believe it ? - He wouldn 't even take my call . - You did call him an asshole . Dr. K ! - We got beer ! - Time to party ! - I 'll take one of those . - Me , too. I just quit smoking . What are you boys doing here ? Thought you could use a brew so you can mellow out . Kick back and chill . Have a beer , relax . It 'll help with your research . Yeah , help with your research . Look at that thing . can we have that when you 're done with it ? Fellas , thanks for the beers , but we 're working . Hold it . - Look . - What are you doing ? Selenium . It could be the answer . I 'm looking at the periodic table on your T-shirt . I 'm seeing a pattern . Take off your shirt . Yes . - No . - All right , look . We are a carbon-based life form . Keep pulling . We move down here and you find our poison : Arsenic . But the aliens are nitrogen-based , right ? You make the same move down and over , and where do you find yourself ? Selenium . It could be as lethal to them as arsenic is to us . With their metabolic rates , it 'll kill them fast . Selenium . How much do we need ? Five hundred gallons should do it . Five hundred gallons ? I hate to be a buzzkill , but where will we get that at 2 : 00 a.m. ? No problem . We can get that . Head Shoulders . The dandruff shampoo ? Yeah , that 's the stuff . The active ingredient is selenium sulphide . How do you know that ? You don 't know anything . Haven 't you noticed how shiny and flake-free our hair is ? Okay , this is the best idea we got . Let 's give it a shot. come on . We 'll get the troops together . We 're getting shampoo ! I have the perfect vehicle . Good ! Donalds , you just got your A 's . Almost full . There 's something I should tell you , but I don 't know exactly how . Just say it . We 're adults and we 're about to die a horrible death soon anyway . I would have rocked your world . - You already have . - All full . Battle stations ! can we continue this discussion later ? Let 's do this ! Let 's shampoo us some aliens ! Lots of soldiers around . There 's an old mine half a click south . We can sneak into the cave through there . " Half a click " ? What are you , in Vietnam ? Hey , I 'm digging this . Work with me . It 's over here ! It 's right here ! - Are you okay ? - I 'm good . Let 's go ! Let 's do this . You sure this leads to the main cavern ? It 'll lead somewhere . Geology 's not an exact science . Where are you ? Where are you , my little aliens ? Show yourself . Warm to the touch . Highly acidic . We 've no time for you to act like you know what you 're doing . What happened to the respect ? Woodman 's going at noon . We have to hurry . - Good . Are the troops in place ? - Ahead of schedule . Excellent . We can go early . Oh , no . What is he doing here ? Governor Lewis . I don 't see anything burning . Where are all the explosions ? We 're just getting underway . I didn 't know you were coming to watch . Well , better make it a good one , Sergeant . That 's General . Not if you screw this up . Keeping my chair warm for me ? Thank you . I 'll take a pair of spy glasses and a hot chocolate . Give me the hose . Get up top . When I give the signal , start pumping the selenium . Got it . We 'll spray all around the meteor then get out of here as fast as we can . Blue monkey ! Wayne , charge the line now ! That 's the napalm ! Woodman went early . Bad ! Wayne , come on ! I 'm out . We 've got to go ! Go ! Faster ! Get up there ! Run for your life ! Quite a bonfire we 've got . Should have brought some wieners . That can be arranged . - First reports are excellent , sir . - Very good . Keep it together , Wayne . Oh , my God . What 's happening ? - It 's coming ! - What 's coming ? Get the hell out of here ! - Great flaming whore balls ! - General , look ! Hurry ! - Drive ! - Go ! All right ! Fall back ! What the hell is that thing ? The napalm forced an evolutionary response , like the match in the petri dish . That 's evolution ? Survival of the fittest . Often , the simplest organism is the strongest . Guys ? It 's freaking out ! It 's starting to have some sort of spaz attack . That 's not spazzing out . It 's getting ready to divide . Mitosis . Wait . There 's going to be more of these things ? - A lot more . - Its cycle is starting again . It will go on growing and doubling until it takes over . But we were here first . So that Head Shoulders idea . Is that still the plan ? I 'm driving . So what if he 's on Air Force One ? It has phones . I 've seen them ! I don 't think this can wait an hour . What 's that fire truck doing out there ? Mama . can you believe this ? We have to find a point of attack . There ! Nasty ! Allison , stop . Right here . Here we go ! Get the ladder up ! Feed me the hose , Deke . - What are you doing ? - Going up top . Not before me . I got a major score to settle . Go , go , go ! We don 't have much time , guys ! Hurry ! - Left ! - Left ! Got it . I haven 't had much practice with this . Stop ! - What 's going on ? - l don 't know , but it 's getting bigger . What are they doing with that ladder ? Looks like they 're getting ready to administer a jumbo enema . We got one shot . Let 's do this . It 's payback time ! Keep it in there ! What 's it look like I 'm doing ? It 's working ! Shit ! What the hell ? Oh , my God ! Give me back my friend , you big sphincter ! She 's going to blow ! Stop kicking ! It 's horrible in here ! - l got you ! - Help me ! Hold me , Ira ! Don 't let me go ! We have to get out of here ! This thing 's going to blow ! You cannot imagine what I saw in there ! Hurry up , guys ! Ira ! Don 't you ever tell anyone where I 've been ! Dear Lord . Uh-oh . Time to go . Go ! We did it ! Here we go , sir . Just relax and we 'll have you as good as new . I am happy to report that all remaining traces of the alien menace have been eradicated using the selenium shampoo formula developed right here . Let me introduce our civilian scientist heroes and their team the best the great state of Arizona has been privileged to produce . So this is your moment . You wouldn 't want to miss this for anything . Firstly , I would like you all to meet Wayne Gray . As of today , a fully credentialed fire-fighter . I spoke to the chief . Thanks , Governor . Now , our next hero Professor Harry Block , noted geologist and winningest coach in north Arizona women 's volleyball . I appreciate that , Governor . First , I thank God . With Him , all things are possible . We just played tough defence , took it one alien at a time and came away with the big W. And finally Doctors Ira Kane and Allison Reed whose tireless efforts , research , and academic findings led to the ... . l think he 's giving her a bit of the Kane Madness . Wow ! Fighting the alien menace can be tough work . So is keeping your hair clean , shiny and dandruff-free . So it is a good thing that we always keep a healthy supply of Head Shoulders around the house .

 Good evening ladies and gentlemen , from the channel 5 newsroom . Top of the news this evening , is speculation concerning the real facts behind the department of health 's announcement about a radioactive spill , supposed to have occurred yesterday at the state nuclear plant . Information from an official source , which reached our newsroom this afternoon , stresses the seriousness of the situation . But at the same time provides a certain amount of reassurance ... Hi Miller . Mr.Desmond 's waiting for you . Go right in . The arrival here , expected at any moment , of professor Otto Hagelberg . One of the original planners of the nuclear station , will undoubtedly enable us to obtain more precise information . You heard ? He 's arriving tomorrow morning at eleven . Take one of the best camera men with you . Why me in particular ? Because I want an exhaustive interview which will reassure our viewers . Not just the truth , pure and simple ? Forget the philosophy Miller . Just do what you 're told . If possible , sir ... Only if possible . He hasn 't arrived yet . Find out which runway they 're landing on . Okay . 981 , cellcode OK . Request cellcode on 56265 . Hey Willie , come over here . What have you got ? - Unidentified trace . - What 's the bearing ? About 30 miles north east . Altitude approximately 5000 . Control tower here . There 's a trace approaching from the north east . Distance about thirty miles . We see it . Doesn 't seem to fit in with any of our data . We 're trying to identify it now . Try to make contact . Calling aircraft thirty miles north east of Glipswick tower . Identify yourself . Calling aircraft thirty miles north east of Glipswick tower . Repeat . Identify yourself please . It could be his radio isn 't working . It 's a Hercules military transport . That 's strange ... It doesn 't have any markings on it . He 's going to land . Coming in on 16 . Would you fire a signal flare please . Hey you up there ! Who are you ? - Where 's the pilot ? - Phone it through . Hello . Hello . Emergency . What the hell 's going on ? What do you think ? Let 's see . - What 's the story ? - Nobody answers , Sir . You inside . Open the door . I repeat . You inside . Open the door . I repeat ! I order you to come out . You have just thirty seconds to make up your minds . It 's Professor Hagenbeck . I don 't believe it . My god ! Let 's get out of here ! Go ! Interrupt the program , we 're transmitting a special news flash . Does the chief know about it ? There 's no time to tell him . Am I in charge of the broadcast , or not ? Whatever you say master , your wish is my command . Wake up Terry . Drop your powder puff , girl , and announce Miller ... Special news flash . Ladies and Gentlemen , your attention please . We are interrupting our transmission of " It 's All Music " for a special news flash . At the end of the news flash , we will return with our regular program . Thank you . Oh shit ! Just when I was gonna do my first close up . Oh , shut up , will you ? I want to listen to it . At 11 o 'clock this morning , an event without precedent took place at the airport of this city . An airplane of no nationality landed on the south runway of the airport . Ignoring all instructions from the control tower . The airport police immediately converged at the scene of the unauthorized landing , surrounding the aircraft , ordering ... Yes sir , I told him that . Right away chief . .. the order had absolutely no effect . What the hell are you doing ? ! - Why did you interrupt my broadcast ? ! - Now don 't get mad at me . It 's not my fault , the chief rang down . What the hell is going on here ? They 're UFO 's . It 's bound to happen sooner or later . You read too many comic books . You can say what you want , but I 'm not going home alone tonight . You can sleep at my house , I 'll protect you . Yeah , who 's gonna protect me from him ? Will you all shut up ! We 're back on the air in 20 seconds . Come on . Is it possible that you 're not aware of the trouble that broadcast could have stirred up ? Or the uproar that would have followed it ? I 'm well aware of that , General Merchenson . But I am a journalist . My job is to keep the public informed . Mr. Miller . Listen to me ... Very carefully . Something very serious has happened at the airport . But until we conclude our investigation , and take the necessary counter measures , nothing is going to leak out . Nothing . The defense department has strictly forbidden it . I don 't give a damn about the defense department . In a democratic country , nobody is allowed to interfere with the freedom of the press , for any reason whatsoever . I see . Mr. Desmond ... As the person in charge of this station , you will be held directly responsible for the dissemination of any tendentious news . I 'm sure you realize what you 're risking . Don 't worry , we won 't transmit anything without your authorization . Thank you . Good morning . I 'm fed up with you Miller . I 'm suspending you from all duties . No you 're not . I quit ! Okay , I 'll take care of it first thing , yes . Excuse me honey , sorry . Hello ? Hello Liz , is my wife there ? She just went out , this minute . Call her back . Immediately ! Yes . Yes sir , of course . Mrs. Miller ... Mrs. Miller ! I am sorry sir , but I missed her . But you 'll be able to reach her at the hospital in half an hour . She said she wasn 't feeling well today . She was going to stay home . I don 't know , maybe she changed her mind . Okay Liz ... Okay . Please don 't answer . It 'll stop . This is your day off . Yes . Agent Warren Holmes ? Speaking . This is civil defense headquarters . General Merchenson would like you to come down here right away . Why , what 's up ? The general will explain everything to you himself . Come right over . The drill is maximum urgency . I 'm sorry my love , we 'll finish our conversation later . What 's wrong ? Don 't you like it ? No , on the contrary . Every time I look at it , I get a feeling of ... Of death ? Is that what you were going to say ? It 's funny ... It 's the first time one of your works have given me a feeling like that . It 's the truth , I 'm sorry . I can 't say that you are wrong . When I look at it objectively ... I mean , when I 'm not actually working on it . I almost get the feeling that I wasn 't the one who made it . But some other being outside of me . It frightens me . That sounds like science fiction . Metaphysics if you want . It 's better if we don 't take it too seriously . I 'll junk it if you like . No , don 't even think of it . Can you imagine what the world would have lost had Michelangelo destroyed his works at the request of Major Warren Holmes ? Yes , but I 'm not Michelangelo . To me my love , you 're much more . Wake up Major . If not , you 're never going to get to work . Camera one . Move out to her waist and hold on her . On two . Hit it ! Holy shit ! What the hell 's going on down there ? Civil defense ? This is the Channel 5 TV station . We 're being attacked ! For God 's sakes ! Send somebody fast ! Get out of here ! Hi Louise . Well , how are you feeling today Phil ? Horrible . I feel like somebody who 's waiting for the hatchet guy to chop off his head , doctor . Well now , that sounds like an improvement over yesterday . - Temperature ? - Normal doctor . Continue with antibiotics every eight hours . Well if it isn 't my favorite patient . Hi , Jim . How are you feeling today ? I feel a lot better , but I can 't play soccer yet . You 've got a couple more weeks and that 's it . Before you know it , you 're going to be running up and down that soccer field making one goal after another , really . Dr. Kramer is the best there is . - Is that the truth ? - The truth . Last night I had this nightmare . It was all about my leg . There was a big explosion . It was right here in the hospital . I got hit , and my leg got cut off . Well we don 't have to worry over that any longer . Jim , your leg 's gonna be just fine . - The truth . - Well okay . I 'll see you later . Our latest reports show the presence of attackers , here , here , and here . This enables us to determine a presumed line of march . From the airport , to the city limits . Then , quite definitely , in a north eastern direction . We don 't know if this indicates a pre-determined plan , but we must react as though it did , we have no other choice . Unfortunately , the reports coming in from our various information centers , the latest from the National Science Academy , are all rather sketchy . But they do suggest , even in a vague way , the type of counter measure to adopt . You may proceed . This is the body of one of the attackers . It was picked up on the runway at the airport . The autopsy categorically excludes an extraterrestrial being . His molecular structure , clearly establishes him as a member of the human race . A paradox when you consider what they 've been doing . Colonel , please . I am Colonel Donahue from the institute of atomic research . The examination of the various tissue samples that we have taken from the body , reveal the presence of a high degree of radioactivity far superior to the level normally tolerated by the human organism . In addition , we have found more or less recent hyper tissue regeneration . Can you make that a little simpler , Colonel . Some of your colleagues may not have the same theoretical or technical background . In other words , this individual and others like him , have been subjected to strong doses of atomic radiation , which increased their physical capacities beyond the norm . - How far beyond ? - That 's difficult to say . But it 's a fact that these cells subjected to every treatment we know have turned out to be almost indestructible . In short , it 's a kind of a superman . Much more than that . What do you mean ? I mean that the abnormal strengthening of the cells vital qualities has increased their direct genetic capacity . In other words Major , the victims of these creatures are contaminated , even if they only suffer minor injuries . Then they can reproduce themselves , Colonel , say indefinitely ? That more or less Major , is correct . And you say with our weapons that they cannot be destroyed . No , that their substance can 't . Excuse me Colonel , but isn 't that the same thing ? Not exactly . A machine may be indestructible , yet its functioning may still be blocked . How ? By interrupting the feeding process for example . Atomic contamination destroys the efficiency of red blood cells in very short order . That is why new blood is always needed ... for these creatures . True the human organism is greatly strengthened . However , the power still remains in the brain . A lesion to the nerve centers can produce paralysis . The procedure stops the complex entirely . You mean that only bullets damaging the cranium can stop these monsters ? This corpse is the proof . It is the only lifeless body we have recovered . The cerebral apparatus has been destroyed . Thank you , Colonel . Lieutenant Reedman you 've heard everything . The order to every soldier and police officer is ' aim for the brain ' . We must be very specific about that . As for our combat plan , we 'll follow emergency plan H and keep plan B in reserve in case the situation gets out of hand . That 's all for the moment gentlemen . Thank you . Oh , Warren ... I have to talk to you . Excuse me General . May I make a phone call ? - Alright , but hurry it up . - Yes sir . Hello . Oh , it 's you Warren . I was in the bathroom doing my hair . I want to look nice for you this evening . I 'm afraid that this evening is out of the question . Can you tell me why ? No , I can 't explain it now . I was looking forward to ... My darling listen . I want you to do exactly as I tell you . Understand ? Perfectly . I will do what you wish and not ask why . A typical male chauvinist pig attitude . Sheila this is serious , don 't kid around . I want you to make sure all doors and windows are locked . Nobody is to be let in ! Nobody , understand ? I 'll be home as soon as I can . And when I get there , you 're to make damn sure it 's me . Clear ? Yes . Transparent . Have you become insanely jealous all of a sudden ? Think whatever you want to think , but for God 's sake Sheila do what I tell you ! Okay . City Poly Clinic , may I help you ? Will you hold the line please . Dr. Miller is wanted on the telephone . It 's for you Dr. Miller . It 's your husband . Tell him I 'm very busy . He can call again later . Thanks . I 'm sorry sir , but Dr. Miller is about to go into the operating room . Please would you call again ... I must speak with her now ! It 's urgent ! Can 't you just ... I 'm sorry sir . I see . Thank you . What are you doing ? Come on . I know . Is the camper all packed ? All packed and filled up with gas . Okay . I 'll get it . No.Leave it . Don 't answer it . It 's probably some bore . Or maybe your father , who always wants to know where we 're going , where we 're going to stop and if we have enough money . Didn 't you know ? Generals are fussy ... and General Merchenson is no exception . I really don 't know why I married Jessica Merchenson . It isn 't even three months and already you repent ? I 'm a pacifist . You know I hate uniforms . Your father wishes you to join him immediately at defense headquarters . He does ? At headquarters ? Why ? I have no idea . He tried to phone you but there wasn 't any answer . He says that you 're not to waste any time . I have a car outside . Why , did something serious happen ? Your father will explain everything to you . Maybe some kind of war broke out . Okay . You can wait for us in the car . Hello , may I talk to General Merchenson ? It 's his daughter speaking . Yes ma 'am . Will you hold the line please , I 'll try to locate him . The line was cut off . Listen , it 's dead . Why don 't we just clear out of here . I don 't like spending my weekend with a General . It 's probably not important . I could call him from a telephone booth . Come on . Hurry up . We have to sneak out so that idiot outside doesn 't realize anything . Okay ? Let 's go . Give me your hand . Dr. Miller , please . I 'm her husband . Oh , I 'm so sorry . Dr. Miller is in the operating room . She 's assisting Dr.Kramer in a very delicate operation and we have the strictest of orders not to disturb her . But I must see her . I can 't wait . Sorry Mr. Miller , orders are orders . Dr. Schreiber ... Dr. Schreiber , Please . We have an emergency in the outpatient department . Dr. Schreiber . What the devil 's going on today ? You know , that 's the sixth emergency in two hours . Alright , alright . I 'll be right down . Hold your socks on . Raise it up . Go through . Move it . It 's Whitey , let him in . Come on Whitey , why are you standing there ? Hey , what 's happened here ? Unfortunately , they 've just sabotaged the south power station as well . We have a team of engineers there , but it will take hours before they can get it working again . With luck . Well ? The lines are still down . There 's orders to bring your daughter and son in law back here to headquarters , General . - Thanks . - General Merchenson . Gentlemen . The government insists that we not dramatize the situation , or leak any news that might cause public disorder . General . We can 't conceal this from the public . It 's absurd . The government disagrees . Well , we 'll just have to try to keep control of public buildings , barracks and hospitals as long as we can . - After which ... - We 'll be completely on our own . You 're right Warren . We 'll simply have to declare a state of emergency ourselves . They 're coming in like flies . Come on . We need all the help we can get . What the devil are they up to those fools ? Why haven 't they turned on the emergency generators ? Two of the generators are out of order but they are starting up the third . It 'll provide just enough current for us and the emergency ward . Have you checked the pulse rate , Anna ? Yes Doctor , weak but regular . Very well , continue with the direct oxygen . And keep the light steady . It 's about time . Anna would you please take care of that and hurry . Yes Doctor . Help ! Somebody help us ! Help ! Oh my god . I can 't breath . Why isn 't somebody doing something ? Open up this door will you ! Come on ! Somebody help ! Oh please god . Help ! Help ! Help ! Anna ! Where are you ? It 's me Anna . Don 't be afraid . Oh my god it 's you . Take it easy . Take it easy . Oh Dean . There 's something ... It 's ... It 's terrible . It 's horrible ... - You can 't imagine ! - Yes , I know . Come on . Have they gone crazy ? Do something . Make them keep quiet . Keep still ... Don 't move . Let 's try to reach the stairs . Now ! Get us out ! Get us out ! My heart feels like it 's bursting . My God ! Why don 't they hear us ? Somebody help us ! Please ! Oh , somebody ... Let 's not panic . If we keep calm then we can all breath a lot easier . The shaft has a lot of air . Why doesn 't somebody do something ? These things have manual controls on them . Why don 't they wind us down ? - You 're right ... - Hey , wind us down ! It 's alright . Be calm . We 're falling ! We 're falling ! Get back . We 're gonna be alright now ! Quick , the ambulance ! Behind you ! Hey George . How about taking us down a little , okay . Air force 7 to base 2 . Air force 7 to base 2 . We 're at coordinate B. So far we 've had no trace of the invaders on this side . It 's only an ambulance heading out of town . I 'll continue on re-con . Any news of your family ? No . None . I only hope they 're alright . I 'm sorry Merchenson . Really , I am . Thank you . Well , the situation is hopeless . Many parts of the country are cut off . Most telephone lines are out . What 's worse , we 've lost contact with government headquarters . We 'll have to declare a state of emergency ourselves . - But you realize ... - I 'm fully aware of the consequences . - I just see no alternative . - I understand . What are your orders ? Please notify bases 112 and 401 to stand by with helicopters , and if necessary , squadrons of fighter bombers . We 've got to get control back at once . Before it is too late . Or before we have all become contaminated just like them . ... has declared a state of martial law . All civilians have been ordered to remain in their houses , or to place themselves under direct protection of the police or the military . Private traffic may circulate but only if authorized by ... It 's frightening . How could a thing like this happen ? It 's part of the vital cycle of the human race . Create and obliterate until we destroy ourselves ! Words ! We 're up against a race of monsters . Created by other monsters who have only one thing on their mind , the discovery of greater power . At least this time there won 't be any historical justification . Even if any of us survive . Do you think it 's possible to stop them ? The infection is like an oil stain , and who knows how far the contagion has spread now . With the grave danger of contamination , public buildings will remain closed for an indefinite time . Weekend vacationers are ordered to report immediately to the nearest police station or military installation . The civil defense authorities have declared a state of emergency . Jessica stop that music will you , it makes me nervous . What 's wrong ? What on earth is the matter ? I just heard a news flash on the radio . Something serious has happened in town . They 've declared a state of emergency . A state of emergency ? Are they crazy ? I don 't know , it 's difficult to understand . But we should go back to town . But we just arrived . I have no intention of giving up my weekend . To hell with the soldiers ! Listen , you 're my wife and I love you and I don 't want anything to happen to you . So it 's better we go away from here . Something doesn 't feel right . Like what ? Like that continuous barking , without seeing a dog around . And we haven 't seen a car since we got here . In a place like this ? ! There 's no traffic . It 's all very strange . Listen ... It 's almost 10 , John should arrive soon . Let 's talk with him . They should know what 's happened in town . Okay . Bob ! Bob , come here ! What do you suppose happened ? There they are ! Martha ... There you are . Martha . What 's going on ? Hey , what are you doing with that gun ? Sheila ! Sheila , open the door ! Please Sheila ! It 's me , Cindy ! Sheila , can you hear me ? Let me in please ! For god 's sake ! Open the door ! Sheila , can you hear me ? For god 's sake , Sheila ! Open the door ! Oh Sheila ... Thank heavens I found you , I just couldn 't stand it any more being in the house all alone . Come into the front room . Johnny went off to work and the cleaning woman never showed up . I kept hearing noises , everywhere ! On the roof , in the cellar ... Well , you can relax now . We 're safe here . At least for the moment . Warren is coming as soon as he can . My god , Sheila ! What 's going on ? I don 't know ... I really don 't know . Have you tried calling Gracie ? Her husband is with the department of ... Something or other . How could I call ? The phones haven 't been working for three hours . Are you sure ? It 's not working here either . There must have been a breakdown at the exchange . Cheer up . Drink this . I 'm frightened Sheila . Really frightened . On the radio they said to stay home and lock all the doors and windows . I did it ... I even barricaded the crawl hole to the cellar . What did you say ? That I barricaded the crawl hole to the cellar . How did I manage to forget that ? Wait Sheila ! Don 't leave me alone ! I 'll come with you ! Thanks for reminding me . Be quiet ! Here , light a candle ... And stay here . They weren 't even curious . We have a red cross protecting us . What is it dear ? Damn ! We 're running out of gas . There . Anybody here ? Anna ... You can get out , there 's nobody here . Looks like they left a while ago . What do you think about this ? It 's not really you . But it 's better than that . Just like a western . Except that they didn 't have instant coffee in the good old days . Another advantage of civilization my dear . Like Coca-cola , or nuclear energy . We 'd be a whole lot healthier without all that stuff . This is good . Do you think we should give up the advantages that we have gained ? Maybe it would be better . However , it is not the fault of science and technology . But of man . We haven 't reached the age of the robot yet . This mess could have been avoided . Yes , but for how long ? I don 't know . But one thing is clear , we 're partly to blame ourselves . Just think of the lifes that we have led up until today . Shut up in those ridiculous cities . In a steel and concrete jungle like machines . All this had to happen to realize the truth . Let 's hope it isn 't too late . ... have special commando units positioned around the city , according to the latest reports from the civil defense headquarters . Public buildings , offices , and businesses alike have been ravaged General Hospital has been hit the hardest . Many have been seriously injured . Hundreds of lives have been lost , with the end still not in sight . General Merchenson , commanding officer of civil defense says ... Anna , it 's better we start moving . Get all the provisions you can from the back room . I 'll get the gas . They 're here ! They 're here Dean ! They 're here , outside ! I saw them Dean , I saw them ! It won 't hold them for long . Find something ... Something like cotton . Perfect . Let 's hope this works . They 're all together . When I say " now " , you open the door . Okay ? - But I can 't ! - Listen ! Do what I say , don 't argue ! Alright then . Now ! Let 's go ! Do you want some more ? Don 't give in . We 'll find a way out . Hang on . I 'm tired . Really tired . And I 'm frightened . We 'll never get away from these ... these monsters . - What are we going to do ? - Alright ... Nothing is going to happen as long as we stay together . I promise you . What we 've got to do now is get away from here as fast as we can . Let go of me ! Why don 't we face it ? There 's no place for us to go . They 're all around us , butchering eveyone ! Later we too will be killed . Oh Dean , I don 't want us to die ! I don 't want us to die but there 's nothing we can do ! They 're all around us ! Everywhere ! Everywhere ! Stop it ! Get down ! Run ... Head for the woods behind you . Go . Get us down a bit closer . They 're all over the place ! Air force 7 to Base 2 ... Air force 7 to Base 2 . I 've located a whole group of them . They are spread out , around a mile south east of the Patterson heights building . We are moving in a south , south east direction . Request immediate air assistance . Over . Base 2 to AF 7 , message received . We 'll pass your request to General Merchenson at once . Yes . Reedmond ? Just listen Reedmond . I 'm not interested in your opinion . I know it 's a huge risk , I agree with that . But there is no alternative . Just carry out my orders . If necessary you can go to the chambers yourself . Hang on Anna . We 'll find some solution in the end . I 'm sure . You know there 's no sollution ! All we can fight for is a little time . But how much ? ! Is that ... Everything seems alright . Looks peaceful . Come on ... Wait here . Wait ! There 's nobody here . But I ... I told you that nobody is here ! Let 's go . Let 's go in , maybe we 'll find some help . Remember the medieval legend ? " If they 're really vampires , they can 't enter the house of god . " Thank the lord , Father . We 're really hoping ... Captain . What 's going on around here ? I 've been on the radio for the last half hour . Why hasn 't someone responded ? We located other infected areas north of here along sector 29 . So get those planes in the air ! Answer ! Or are you looking for a court martial ? Don 't move major or I 'll kill you . I 'm not going to die like the others . You can 't fool me Major . You 're like all the rest . Contaminated ! Bringing death and destruction . I don 't intend to die . - I want to live ! - Put that gun down ! Are you crazy ? ! You 're calling me crazy ? ! You 're calling me ! I am not crazy ! Air force 7 to Base 2 ... Air force 7 to Base 2 . This is Major Holmes calling . Caydon Airport is out of action . It has been infiltrated and sabotaged . Standing by for further orders . Over . Just a minute , Major . I will pass you over General Merchenson . Warren . This is Merchenson . Listen carefully . All communications with operational command units have been cut off . Do you hear me ? Area B is out . Return to base . Do you hear me ? Your mission is useless now . Message received General . Will do . Over and out . Oh , Donahue . I suppose you 're here to tell me your experiment didn 't work out . Yes ? On the contrary . The gas has proven effective . Our planes can fire it with their missile launchers . You can begin at once , General . But Donahue , we have no planes ! Not anymore . And there 's no more Reedman . But didn 't he leave from the airbase at Chatters ? He never got there . They brought him here twenty minutes ago . May God help us all . Wait here . I 'm taking another passenger . Sheila ? You there ? Sheila . Why did you leave the door open ? I told you to ... No Sheila ! No ! Sheila ! Forget all about that priest . Okay . Look . Look at that ! Maybe it still works . Wait here . Run to the jeep when I give you the signal . Run for it ! Run ! Run ! Hurry Dean . Over here ! Over here ! Over here ! Let 's try to pull them out of there . Hurry up ! But Major , is it worth it ? Maybe they 're already infected . Just do what I tell you . Come on , you can do it ! Hang on ! Come on ! Don 't look down ! Don 't look down Anna ! Don 't look down ! Pull ! You can do it , come on ! I can 't hold on ! Don 't let go ! I can 't hold on ! No ! No ! What is it , Dean ? What 's wrong ? Oh , nothing . I had a horrible dream . A nightmare . Anna ... How do you feel ? Are you allright ? Yes , fine . I just wanna go to sleep . Oh God it 's late ! I have to get to the airport . That interview with the nuclear scientist . Professor Hagenback . He 's an important man . He 's a nuclear scientist . Professor Hagenback . Important man ... Are you listening to me ? He hasn 't arrived yet . Go find out what runway he 's landing on . Okay . Hey Willie . That unidentified aircraft is heading in . Please identify yourself . Maybe his radio isn 't working . He 's heading for runway 16 . Get everything off his path . What the hell is going on ? I don 't know . Let 's see . - What 's the story ? - Nobody answers , sir . This is the police . You are to come out . I repeat . This is the police . You are to come out . The nightmare becomes reality ...

 ( SEAGULLS CAWING ) ( PEOPLE SHOUTING ) Help me . No ! Hold on . Let go ! Help ! MAN : The boy . Get the boy ! Father ! Give us a hand , son . Hurry . ( SCREAMS ) Hurry , son . I can 't hold them off much longer . Father ! ( WHINING ) ( DOOR CLOSING ) TOM : Just leave him at home . ELIZABETH : I can 't . You know that . I don 't believe it . Every time , every time it happens like this . What do you want me to do ? Put him out on the street ? Can it , Ralph . Look , he 's my nephew . He doesn 't have anybody else . I don 't care . I just don 't want him to ruin our trip to Cancun . Look , can 't you send him off someplace ? Send him off to ... Yeah , that 's right . Where ? You tell me where and I 'll do it . Look , do you think I like being saddled with an 11-year-old kid ? Oh , why did Bill and Cathy have to die ? ( PLUMMETING ) ( THUDDING ) ( MAN GRUNTING ) ( MAN MUTTERING ) ( RALPH BARKING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( BARKING ) Smoking bat 's breath ! Could 've killed me . When did they start building them this high ? This isn 't 1492 . Where 's Columbus , kid ? Where am I ? ( SNARLING ) Ralph ! He 's got my book . Ralph , let go ! Keep your lousy fangs off of me . Ralph , come on . Ralph , give it up . Let go ! ( JEFFREY SCREAMING ) ( PLUMMETING ) ( GRUNTS ) Just once I 'd like to land on a haystack . A nice , soft , sweet-smelling haystack . Are we alive ? Alive ? Oh , no . Yeah , we 're alive . What year was that ? I got to get you back . What year ? Year . And don 't tell me 1492 . I know for a fact they didn 't have buildings like that in 1492 . They do in ' 82 . ( LAUGHS ) A joker . Funny . We 'll try that again 'cause you 're a nice kid . What year ? 1982 . And I 'd like to know where we are right now . Son , I 'm not a man known for being patient . This here Omni 's only got circuits to 1970 . The only way I can get you to ' 82 is if the lousy thing ... ( OMNI BEEPING ) Bat 's breath ! It 's losing it again in the automatic mode . Bat 's breath ? Do you know how difficult it is to field strip one of these things ? Where 's my Guidebook ? Got to be around here somewhere . Well , help me , will you ? Is it black ? Yeah . Now look . Can 't do a lousy thing without it . About this big ? Right . Right . You got it there ? No . Ralph does . Ralph ? My dog . Dog . You mean the big , furry thing with all the teeth . Ralph . In 1982 ? ( BOGG MUTTERS ) Do you know what you 've done ? History 's going to change because you couldn 't control your shaggy , little mutt . Empires are going to fall . Wars are going to rage . I 'm going to lose my job . Your job ? Who do you think you are ? You break into my room . You knock me out a window . You bring me here , wherever I am . You deserve to lose your lousy job ! Yeah ? Yeah ! Smart kids give me a pain . Hey , where are we going ? ( CHUCKLES ) Where am I going ? I 'm going to salvage what 's left of my job . You 're going to get lost . I am lost . ( BABY GURGLING ) Hey ! Hey , what ? Is this what you 're looking for ? JEFFREY : Well , is it ? I don 't know . You don 't know ? If I had my Guidebook , I 'd know . Now , I 've just got to guess . ( BEEPING ) Check the old Omni . Nope . Not it . Not what ? Not right . Well , if you 'd tell me what 's going on here , I might be able to help . Who are you ? What are you ? What am I ? I am a voyager . You ever hear of one ? Of course not . No one has . We 're the people that are plucked out of time and trained to travel through the ages to help history along . You know , give it a shove where it 's needed . Problem is , though , you see , there was this blonde in my class , real nice legs and she got a mole right here , and this kind of mysterious way of talking . Kind of distracted me , you know ? Maybe you don 't know . Anyway , I figured I didn 't have to pay attention . The Guidebook tells you what you gotta do . But your Guidebook ... Was your fur coat 's dinner . So , here I am . In Egypt , 1450 B.C. And I haven 't got the foggiest idea what I 'm supposed to do . ( BABY GURGLES ) You got an idea , kid ? This is Egypt . 1450 B.C. Maybe I 'm supposed to feed him . We traveled through time ? Got some beef jerky here somewheres . Moses ! What ? Hey , be careful with him , will you ? He 's Moses . Moses ? Moses was an old man with white whiskers . Looks like Santa Claus with a part in the middle . What are you doing ? Putting him back in the water . He 'll drown . ( SHUSHING ) Look . Moses was found by the pharaoh 's daughter , in the Nile . ( DINGS ) That 's it . Green light . How 'd you know ? My dad was a history professor . Let me see . Which one do you press to ... ( PEOPLE YELLING ) ( PLUMMETING ) You little toad . Don 't you ever , ever touch this ... Oh , no . ( EXCLAIMS ) Hey , easy . It 's okay , kid . They almost ran over us . That ought to give you a pretty good idea why you 'll never touch this Omni again . What am I saying ? Nice to know you , kid . Sorry for any inconvenience , but I work alone . Oh , no , you don 't . You got me into this , you 're getting me out . I got school tomorrow . Can 't take you back . I don 't even know where I am . France , 1918 . The Revolutionary War . First World War . What ? The First World War . Right . ( HORSE NEIGHING ) ( GUN FIRING ) Those the good guys ? Yeah . ( YELLING ) Hold it right there ! That thing 's dangerous . Will you put that down before ... We 're the good guys . Then get us out of here . Help me with this jacket , will you ? Where do you think you 're going ? To create a little diversion . Motor Transportation 1A . When you want it to go ... Motor Transportation 1A . The clutch . Oh , the clutch . Bat 's breath . Come on , we 'd better get inside . Think he 'll come back ? He better . Who is he , anyway ? My father . Oh . Motor Transportation 1A . Wanna get off . Jump ! ( SPEAKING GERMAN ) ( OMNI BEEPING ) So much for motorcycles . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) ( EXCLAIMING ) Bat 's breath ! Will you stop it ? " Bat 's breath " ? Is that you ? No , it 's General Eisenhower . Eisenhower ? Wrong war . Don 't they have light in here ? Oh , yeah , we found some lamps . ( STAMMERING ) Hey , I 'm really sorry . First I try to shoot you , and now this . We didn 't really hurt you or anything , did we ? Hurt me ? You two ? No . Okay . Where 'd you get the uniform ? You don 't want to know . How is he ? He 's better . He 's still unconscious but your son here was able to stop the bleeding . My what ? It was a clean shoulder wound . But his fever 's coming down . We were on our way to an entertainers troupe on the front line when the zeppelins attacked . There were bombs everywhere . The corporal here took the only road out , but it put us behind enemy lines . And here we are . You know who this is ? No , son , but I 'm sure you 'll introduce us . This is Mary Murphy . Mary Murphy , the actress ? And this is my father . Phineas Bogg . Phineas ? Phineas . Now , it 's obvious we 've got to get these two back where they belong . So why don 't you stay and watch the corporal for a while , while I go out and look for a truck ? I 'll go with you . Not in that , you won 't . Well , how about this ? It 's perfect . So instead of stumping for war bonds at home , I decided to come here and boost the boys ' morale . You sure boost mine . I heard about your wife . Wife ? Jeffrey told me how she died . Oh , Jeffrey . You know , I think it 's wonderful the way you 're bringing him up on your own . I really haven 't done that much . You 're modest . I love a modest man . I 'm very modest . Do you ever think about coming to Hollywood ? You know , you really remind me of Doug . Doug ? Yeah . Fairbanks . The swashbuckler . Doug . Listen , could we get back to the modesty part ? Is that what we 're looking for ? Where ? Over there . Perfect . Now if we can only get those two away from there ... Kiss me . No problem . How could you do this to me ? Do you know what this does to me ? What are you doing ? No ! Don 't touch me . I hate you ! I hate you ! ( CRYING ) Eddie Rickenbacker ? You 're the Eddie Rickenbacker ? Yeah , sure , I guess . Corporal Eddie Rickenbacker . Columbus , Ohio . Well , what are you doing here ? Kid , I was gonna ask you . But you 're the number one ace . You should be up in the air dogfighting . Dogfighting ? I hate to tell you , but dogs don 't fly . The only thing that 's up in the air these days is zeppelins , and the Jerries are taking us to the cleaners with them . You mean we 're losing the war ? You better like sauerkraut . But what about airplanes ? You just go up in the air and shoot the zeppelins down . Aeroplanes ? Oh , kid , they can barely get those things off the ground . That Bleriot guy who invented them keeps landing in the English Channel . Bleriot ? But what about the Wright brothers ? Who ? Uh-oh ! Kid ! Where you going ? That was my fianc√© . It 's so low , what he did to me . He 's terrible , he 's awful , he 's hideous . Phineas ! Bat 's breath . Halt ! The truck . Hey ! ( BOGG MUTTERING ) What the heck ? How does this thing ... The clutch . Clutch . SOLDIER : Stop . Stop the truck . Of all the times . I know what 's wrong here . What 's wrong here is you . Halt . ( GUNS FIRING ) Did you see where Mary was when you came running around the side ? Got to go back and get her . There aren 't any airplanes . What ? SOLDIER : Stop it . Stop the truck . Airplanes ! That 's what we have to change . Without airplanes , the Germans are gonna win the war . The Germans didn 't win the war ? ( TIRES SCREECHING ) Hang on , kid , look out . SOLDIER : Capture them . Catch them alive . Someday , somewhere in time , I 'm gonna ... Look , can you set that Omni thing any place in time ? You bet , and when I find the guy who invented this contraption ... Look , forget the truck . The corporal with Mary is Eddie Rickenbacker . So ? So he was the top US flying ace . Problem is , there aren 't any airplanes around to fly in . He 's never even heard of the Wright brothers . Yeah , that makes two of us . Wright brothers ? Kitty Hawk , North Carolina , 1903 . Kid , you better be right . Hang on . BOGG : Well , thanks for your trouble . That 's another one , kid . Face it . No one here has even heard of the Wright brothers . Red light still blinking ? ( OMNI BEEPING ) Like crazy . That 's because they 're not here . We got to go to Dayton . Dayton ? You foul up our escape , make me leave Mary in the middle of the First World War , dragging me halfway around the world to find a couple of guys who 's not even here , and you expect me to take you to Dayton ? That 's where their bicycle shop is . No , kid , this is it . Time to part our ways . You 're in America , same century . That may be the best I can do . So why don 't we just ... Can it . You 're stuck with me until you put me back in my room where you got me . Besides , you don 't know anything about history . You 'll mess the whole thing up . Yeah ? And what 's this father business , huh ? I haven 't met a girl like that in 300 years and you tell her you 're my son ? You know what that could do to my reputation ? What about your own father ? What would he say ? My father 's dead . Yeah , and if he 's anything like me , you probably did him in , too . Just shut up ! Hey , Jeff ! I 'm sorry . Jeffrey ! Come on , man . ( EXCLAIMS ) Sorry , man . No . No , let me go ! Let me go ! Easy , Jeff . No . Hey , hey , easy . No , no , no . Easy , Jeffrey . No . Let me go . ( CRYING ) Let me go , let me go . ( CRYING ) It 's gonna be okay , Jeff . I 'm sorry . We were going camping up north . I was in the camp reading some comics . I don 't know , Dad must 've fallen asleep . 'Cause we ran off the road into some trees . I was all right . But Mom and Dad got real smashed up . I tried to get them out . But there was this fire . I went up to the road , to try to get someone to help . But no one would stop . I couldn 't get anyone to stop . Don 't blame yourself , kid . Just get some rest . ( SIGHING ) Dayton . ( HORN HONKING ) ( NEIGHING ) Will you stop that ? I can 't help it . They itch , they 're hot . They make me feel stupid . It wasn 't my idea to come to Dayton . Well , this is it . It certainly is . Good afternoon . Forget it , Bogg . She 's a blonde . BOGG : Nice day . AGNES : It certainly is . Phineas Bogg . Agnes Spence . Come on , Romeo , I found us a job . It 's my nephew . Oh ! WILBUR : You had no business doing it . ORVILLE : Well , I didn 't think I 'd have to ask your permission . Of course not , because you knew what I 'd say . Good morning . You gents looking for some help ? Morning . Just a minute . She wanted me to ask her out . You know that she 's my girl , Orville . Well , this hurts to say , Will . But Agnes doesn 't even like you . Oh , that 's news to me . In fact , she thinks this whole flying idea of yours is crazy and childish . Gentlemen , excuse me . Just one minute , wait a second . Flying is my idea ? Who spent 10 days flying this box kite , huh ? Who , huh ? Huh ? Who spent four sleepless nights designing these wings ? Huh ? Who worked for a solid month building this model ? And you 're calling me childish ? Childish , childish . Childish is working six months on a glider that won 't fly in a crosswind . Childish . Childish is wanting to ride this thing off a big rock cliff . Mature . Mature is putting it away before someone gets hurt . Agnes likes her men mature . WILBUR : Mature . Agnes likes her men mature , does she ? Well , Wilbur , that 's what she told me . Well , maybe I 've matured , too . Hey , guys , I think this has gone far enough , really ... Maybe I don 't care too much about younger brothers , flying machines or bicycle shops . Maybe I matured so much that I 've had it with this whole kit and caboodle . You know , I really don 't think Agnes would want you two to be arguing like this . Oh , you ain 't got the maturity of a billy goat , Wilbur . We 're finished , you hear that ? We 're through . We 're through ! Agnes ? Well , kid , guess we got the job . JEFFREY : And this whole thing 's because of a girl ? Because of a girl ? Kid , wars have been fought over women . Some day you 'll understand . But I really wouldn 't blame Agnes . This is a case of three people being confused about what they really want . Agnes thinks she wants love , when all she really cares about is romance . Orville and Wilbur think they want Agnes , when all they really care about is flying . Think this will work ? If I read them right . They see this fly and Agnes is a memory . How 's it look ? Terrific . Let 's hear the notes to the boys . JEFFREY ... " Dearest Wilbur , I have so many things to tell you . " Orville means nothing to me . Meet me at Big Rock ... " " Dearest Orville , I have so many things to tell you . " Wilbur means nothing to me . " Meet me at Big Rock Creek , this morning at 10 ... 00 . " BOGG ... Dearest Agnes , my heart stopped when I saw you outside the shop . Forget the Wright brothers . I 'll be at Big Rock Creek this morning at 10 ... 00 waiting to prove my soaring love . Yours forever , Phineas Bogg . It 's a long way down . Uh-huh . Think they 'll come ? They 'll come . Think it 'll fly ? As long as there isn 't a crosswind . Whoa . ( CLICKING TONGUE ) Whoa . Phineas ! Phineas ? ( WIND HOWLING ) JEFFREY : Too windy , Bogg . Forget it , you can 't fly in this . BOGG : Can you see them ? They 're almost up to her . Get that left side down . Hold it down . I can 't , there 's too much wind . Where are they now ? For you , darling . Sorry my brother had to be so immature as to follow me . Follow you ? I think it 's time we ended this once and for all . Tell him , Agnes . Tell him what ? Tell him about the note you wrote me . What note , Orville ? " Meet me at Big Rock at 10 : 00 . " So that I can whisper the secrets of ... " " ... my love in your precious ear . " All my love , " BOTH : " Agnes . " Cat 's out of the bag . Got to go now . You can 't , Bogg . Not in a crosswind . Out of the way , boy . It 's suicide . I 'm a voyager , kid . Sometimes you 've gotta bite the bullet . No ! Bogg , don 't ! No ! Come on , move it , horse . Let 's go ! ( PROMPTING HORSES ) I don 't know what to say , Wilbur , Orville . This is not my handwriting . Well , then who in tarnation ... Phineas ! " Waiting to prove my soaring love . " Our glider ! Will , it 's our glider ! And it 's flying . AGNES : Phineas ! ( ALL LAUGHING ) It 's flying . Look , look . Straighten out . Be careful . ( LAUGHING ) WILBUR : Keep your weight down . AGNES : Be careful , Phineas . Weight back . Who the heck is it ? Some darn fool . Weight back , weight back . Doesn 't this thing ever come down ? Phineas ! I had to ask . Bogg ! He 's going down ! Bat 's breath ! JEFFREY : Bogg ! Bogg ! No , no , Bogg , you can 't die . ( GRUNTS ) Bogg ? Easy , kid , will you ? Do you always treat your friends like that ? But I saw you crash ! I thought ... Yeah , I know . I know . I 'm glad to see you , too . Do you mind ? Oh , sorry . Phineas ! Phineas ! Oh , Phineas ! Your soaring love , it was wonderful . Oh , look at you . Are you all right ? A little worse for wear , darling . But now I know more than ever that I want to marry you . Marry me ? Yes . Ever since the first day I saw you , I knew we 'd grow old together . You and me and our 10 children . Ten children ? Why don 't you wait for me in the buggy ? I 'll be right there . Wilbur , Orville . Doggone , that was beautiful . Wilbur and Orville Wright . Jeffrey Jones , Phineas Bogg . Howdy . You know , the problem you had up there was lift . I was thinking , maybe if we made the elevators a little bit bigger . Mount the first forward , see ? We need to put a man inside , not hanging . And then we can double up the rudders and stack the wings for more lift . We 'll need a long run , steady wind . You know , Will , there 's this place in North Carolina , Kitty Hawk . Kitty Hawk , yeah . ( DINGS ) Green light , kid . But we can 't leave now , not yet . Got to . But they 're going to invent the airplane . We can be there , we could help . We 've helped enough already . Look , I know it 's hard . I 've been there , too . But whenever you feel this way , you got to think of all the interesting people in front of you , who really need your help . Heck , we 're voyagers , kid . We got responsibilities . Besides , don 't you wanna see what all this has done ? Yeah . Phineas . You know , I 've really been thinking . It 's about those 10 children . I really think that I 'm just too young to have 10 children . Phineas ? ( PLUMMETING ) A haystack ! Green light ? ( BEEPING ) Still red . Now where are your planes , kid ? We put Orville and Wilbur back on the right track . They got to be around here somewhere . I suppose red could mean that something else is wrong . Oh , we 'll find out soon enough . Run , kid ! Right behind you . Terrific , wonderful . We get airplanes into the war so they can blow us to bits . Who was that guy ? It was red . Richthofen . Richthofen ? The guy with Mary ? Rickenbacker . Richthofen is the Red Baron . Hey , is that Eddie ? Mary . We got to get them out of there . Eddie , Mary ! Who are you ? Jeffrey Jones . That was another war , kid . I 'm Phineas Bogg . This is Jeff , my son . We 're here to help you . You okay ? That arm looks pretty bad . EDDIE : I 'm alive . Which is more than I can say for the guys in the escort plane . MARY : We were on our way to an entertainment troupe on the front lines when the Baron shot us down . Hit the deck ! Why didn 't he fire ? He wants me . Top German meets top American . But you can 't go up in one of those . Not in the two-seater . He 'll cream you . It 's all right , kid . He 's not going to . Take off your jacket and scarf . At this distance , he 'll never know the difference . Forget about it , pal . You 're in no shape to take him on . Not in one of those . Fly Mary out of here . We 'll take care of the Baron . It 's worth a shot . You know how to fly one of these things ? Did Marie Antoinette have great legs ? If you go first , will he wait for me ? Yeah , Baron doesn 't shoot an unarmed plane . His code of honor . He 'll never attack . Good luck , pal . Well , I don 't know who you guys are , but thanks a million . You know , I get the strangest feeling that we 've met somewhere before . Maybe in another war . Listen , If you 're ever in Hollywood ... What about Doug ? Who 's Doug ? Good luck . Hey , why 'd you lie to him ? You can 't fly one of these things . I didn 't lie . I never lie . Marie Antoinette had terrible legs . Climb down , kid . I 'm doing this solo . Oh , no , you don 't . You go down , I go down . Forget it . Who 's gonna shoot the gun ? No discussion . That 's it . Get down . Hey , where is the clutch ? The thing doesn 't have a clutch . Smart kids give me a pain . JEFFREY : Hold on , here we go . Remember the Maine . Remember the what ? The stick . The stick ? What about the trees ? The stick ! Pull up on the stick . Oh , that stick . We 're flying ! ( GUN FIRING ) He 's right behind you . Get him off your tail . Pull up . JEFFREY : That 's it , we lost him . We lost him . JEFFREY : Put the nose down . We 're gonna stall . We 're gonna what ? Pull up ! Pull up ! I can 't . JEFFREY : Then push down . Where is he now ? He 's right on our tail . Shoot him . Shoot him . I am . Try to hit him . JEFFREY : He 's coming right at us ! I got him . I got him ! We got him ! That 's it . Green light , kid . We did it . We did it . ( ENGINE SPUTTERING ) We 're going to go down , kid . Hold on , kid . Hold on . This will hopefully help me now . ( EXPLOSION ) We 're alive . Yeah , we made it . And Eddie and Mary ? BOGG : Green light , kid . All the way . You liked her , didn 't you ? Me ? No . What makes you say that ? I don 't know . It 's just the way you looked at her . Sort of mushy . Not like Agnes . Yeah , well , forget the way I looked at her . We 're voyagers , kid . We have no time for romance . Right , voyagers . No romance . Time is our oyster . Oyster , right . Quarter to no man . No man . And we can do anything , change anything , be anything . Voyagers . Voyagers . ( CANNON BOOMING ) You hear that ? Sounded like a cannon . Where are we ? England . 1066 , Pearl Harbor . That 's it . That 's what 's wrong . They didn 't have cannons in 1066 . Battle of Hastings . Battle of what ? BOGG : Oh , no . Bat 's breath . Not again . JEFFREY ... If you want to learn more about the Wright brothers , Eddie Rickenbacker and the early days of flying , take a voyage to your nearest public library . It 's all in books ! JEFFREY : We got to jump , Harriet . I 'd jump in a fire if I had to . Stop ! ( BARKING ) What 's going on here ? This here is my slave . I own her . Harriet Tubman . ( ROARS ) I 'd like to see them fight as a pair . ( GRUNTING ) Kill me , Spartacus . Give the Romans what they want . ( YELLING ) BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! ( MEN GRUNTING ) What 's he doing with a net ? Spartacus will use the net to trip his opponent . You were right , Bitiatus , he is the best gladiator in Capua . ( PLUMMETING ) Noble fight , my friend . ( GRUNTING ) I gotta be doing something wrong . Bogg . I know . I know . It 's gonna be another one of those days . ( PEOPLE APPLAUDING ) CICERO : Bravo ! Wonderful , Bitiatus . Simply marvelous . Yes , it is indeed . I 'm glad Your Excellency is pleased . Pleased ? I 'm amazed . It 's the first time I 've ever seen men fly through the air like that . It 's the first time for me , too . I think they mean us . Where are we , Bogg ? ( BEEPING ) How does the south of Italy , 73 B.C. Grab you ? That explains the gladiators . You got any idea what 's wrong ? It 's flashing red . I don 't know . I 'm not too great with this part of history . CICERO : They came out of nowhere . How did you pull off such a feat ? Well , surely , Your Greatness , I would not pretend to be more clever than you . I 'm sure you see right through my little trick . A large catapult ? Oh , Cicero , if only more members of the Senate shared your brilliance . And your inventiveness . It 's no wonder you are the greatest gladiator trainer in the Republic . Now , who are these human projectiles ? What are their names ? They 're new , Your Grace . In fact , they just arrived . Names , slaves ! I 'm Bogg . This is Jeffrey . Hi . Jeffrey and Bogg are strange names for slaves . Not to mention their attire . Strange names for anyone , sire . They must have been captured from one of the outer provinces . The small one is cute , isn 't he , Aunt Octavia ? OCTAVIA : Yes , he is . Very cute . I 'd like to see them fight as a pair . Against that gladiator we saw this morning . Tomeris . Yes . And I 'd like to see them fight to the death . To the death ? Think , kid . I 'd kind of like to know what we 're supposed to be doing here before I get myself killed . I 'm thinking , I 'm thinking . Come on . No talking , slaves . All right . Take it easy , guys . Cicero , Your Magnificence , Your Eminence , I love a bloody fight to the end as much as anyone , but we 're but a humble school whose purpose is for the training of gladiators for sale . And if I may be so bold as to say , a dead gladiator is not worth the ground he 's buried in . Unless you want to buy the loser . I don 't buy losers . All right , not to the death , and I will buy the winner . A most wise decision , My Lord . And of course , I want to buy Spartacus . Bogg , it 's Spartacus . What ? Spartacus led the first slave revolt in history . He led it from Capua in 73 B.C. I knew you 'd come through . I want him shipped out to Rome immediately . You will be the finest gladiator in my stable . I 'm no animal for your stable . Seize him . Well , he has a most rebellious spirit . Well , I 'll break him of that , or else he 'll become meat for my lions . Bogg , once a gladiator goes to Rome , he never comes back . And the revolt was led from here . So , we go to Rome and make sure he comes back . That means we have to win this fight . Don 't worry , kid . It 's in the bag . Here are your weapons . You expect us to fight with these ? ( LAUGHING ) At least give us some shields . The Romans had a great sense of humor . ( ROARING ) Bogg , this is it . Don 't try anything heroic . That can 't be human . ( ROARING ) David beat Goliath . I was there , kid , it was a lucky shot . Stay away from him , let me handle this . Come on , Bogg . Look at him . You can 't beat him by yourself . You know , kid , you might be right . Easy , big fellow . Come on , easy now . Watch it , Bogg ! JEFFREY : Look out ! JEFFREY : Bogg , duck ! Stay away from him . The guy 's an animal . Bogg , look ! Bogg , over here ! Now , Bogg ! Now ! We did it . I told you we would . ( LAUGHING ) The bigger they are , the harder they fall . Yeah . The big ape . Now , it 's off to Rome ... See , I 'm afraid of heights . You big ape ! I think you get down . ( ALL APPLAUDING ) Bogg , are you hurt ? Nothing a week with Florence Nightingale wouldn 't cure . Wonderful fight . Have Tomeris sent to me in Rome immediately . Certainly . Well , we tried . Yeah , but now we don 't go to Rome . Please , Father , will you buy the boy ? You promised me that you would buy me my very own slave for my birthday . But that 's not for six months , dear . Go ahead , buy him . And buy his friend , too . I have a feeling his good looks will attract the women of Rome to the arena . Oh , please , Father . It would be fun to see the three of them fight again . All right , I 'll buy them all . Thank you , Father . BITIATUS : Guards , have all three of them sent to Rome . I 'm going to love having him feed me grapes . Yes , and I 'm sure his friend might prove useful also . It seems as though your sister has taken a fancy to your new slave . Yes , this has happened before . Funny , they always seem to be among the first to die in the arena . See , I told you it would be much more fun having me as your friend instead of your slave . Until now , I 've never had a friend , only slaves . Well , now you have a friend , and I 'll do things for you because I want to make you happy , not because I have to . That makes it nicer . Okay , what 'll it be ? Your wish is my command . I want to be able to do something for you . To make you happy . Really ? Well , there is one thing that would really help me out . But it 's a pretty big favor to ask . You 're my friend . No favor is too big . ( WATER DRIPPING ) SPARTACUS : I 've got to go back to Capua . BOGG : I know . You know ? Sure , I mean , Capua was a whole lot better than this place . Capua is a terrible place . Men and women trained to be animals . And all for the pleasure of the Romans . It made me sick . Slavery has gone on a long time . Maybe it 's time somebody did something about it . I did do something . I was beginning to unite the other gladiators . I thought maybe we could form an army . Attempt a revolt . At Capua , the gladiators outnumber the guards . We would have had a good chance . You still have a chance . Not in Rome . Here we are outnumbered . For me it 's just a dream . Maybe someday someone else can lead it . ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) Hey , kid , where 'd you get the fancy clothes ? Never mind that . We 're getting out of here . Who 's this ? Don 't worry , he 's one of us . Where 'd you get the key ? Calpurnia 's gonna show us a way out of the house . What about the guards ? Don 't worry about the others . We slipped them mickeys . What 's a mickey ? Come on . Thanks a lot . I hope this won 't get you into a lot of trouble . Don 't worry , I can handle my father . ( WHISTLE BLOWING ) Come on . I 'll come back someday . I promise . GUARD : The gladiators have escaped ! Get them ! ( WHISTLE BLOWING ) What 's the trouble ? Spartacus and the other two new slaves have escaped . I want Spartacus back alive . The others , I don 't care . Yes , my Lord . ( WHISTLE BLOWING ) I have a feeling this isn 't going to be easy . I think you 're right . I have orders to spare your life , Spartacus . You die another day in the arena . I 'd like to take you with me . What about us ? You ? You and your friend aren 't so lucky . Take them both out and make an example out of them . BOGG : Come on , kid . I 'm right behind you . They 're running toward the market . BOGG : Get that torch , kid . Throw it in the oil . JEFFREY : What is that stuff ? Olive oil burns great , huh ? That should stop them . Yeah . There they are ! There 's no way out , kid . So hit it , Bogg . Hit the Omni . ( BEEPING ) ( PLUMMETING ) ( BEEPING ) Missouri , 1847 . America . It 's nice to be home . All countries are the same to me . All have excitement . All have women . All have problems . ( DOGS BARKING ) Bogg , look ! Let 's do something before they catch up to her and tear her apart . It 's okay ! Come on down ! Really , we have the dogs . Don 't worry . They won 't hurt you . Harriet , you come down here , right now . Andrew , Junior , get her down from there . Get away from her . What do you think you 're doing , boy ? What 's going on here ? Now , what 's it look like ? She 's a runaway . BOGG : A runaway what ? Slave . Slave ? But I thought this was America . It is . Where it 's legal to own slaves . Leastwise in this state . Now this here is my slave . I own her . I won her in a poker game . Harriet Tubman . Bogg , she was never in Missouri . Well , she is now . You . Better let go of her if you know what 's good for you . Stealing a slave is a hanging offense . Bogg , we can 't let them take her . Well , there 's not much we can do . I 'm sorry . Those two must be abolitionists . You see the clothes that young feller 's wearing ? You talk about strange . Yeah . You ain 't kidding . Bogg , we have to help her . Harriet Tubman was an escaped slave who worked on the Underground Railroads . She helped to free hundreds of other slaves . All right . All right , but we have to do it fast . We 've got to get back to Spartacus . Okay . Let 's find out where they 're keeping her and break her out . No , forget it . I got a better idea . This is the dumbest idea you 've ever had . There 's nothing dumb about winning enough money to get Harriet 's freedom back . There is when you don 't know the first thing about playing cards . Hey , you know , I was a voyager long before I met you . I was playing cards when they were still made out of rocks . Must 've been tough to shuffle . Come on , Bogg , I still say we break her out tonight and I can 't do it alone . It 's no use . Look what happened when we tried to break Spartacus out . We 're out numbered . My way is fast , easy , and painless . Okay . Go ahead . Chicken out . Are you calling me chicken ? If the feathers fit . Okay , that 's it . I 'm going on that boat , and I 'm gonna win Harriet 's freedom back . If you don 't like it , you 're on your own . Bogg . Smart grownups give me a pain . BOY : Five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten ... JEFFREY : What are you doing ? Counting the herd . Herd of what ? Herd of frogs . I had sixteen head yesterday . I think one escaped in the night . What do you do with them ? Jump them . See which one can jump the furthest . I 've won six straight contests . My name 's Jeffrey . Mine 's Sam . You come on in on the riverboat with your folks ? No . I don 't have any parents . ( FROG CROAKING ) Oh , yeah . I lost a pap a while back . You 're not alone , are you ? Oh , no . I 'm here with a friend . At least I was . Boy , grownups can really be jerks . Yeah . I don 't have much use for them myself . You and your friend get in a fight ? Yeah . We saw a runaway slave get captured this morning . I want to go back and help her escape again . But my friend won 't help me . He says it 's a bad idea . Well , I have to go along with your friend there . Ain 't right to help a slave escape . Well , you think slavery is right ? Well , preachers don 't say it 's wrong , teachers don 't neither . Even the government says it 's all right . Well , you wouldn 't want to be a slave , would you ? Well , heck , no ! Well , then why do you think it 's right for anyone else to be one ? I don 't know . It 's just ... I 've seen colored folk as slaves all my life . I just kind of got used to it . It just seems natural . Well , it 's not natural , it 's wrong . One day everyone 's gonna see that , and it 's gonna be illegal in every state . Well , I still don 't know if slavery 's right or wrong . But like my ma always says , I 'm not one to put down a chance to get into trouble . So if you 're gonna break that slave out tonight , well , I 'll help you . How much have I made so far ? Fifteen thousand on this trip . Oh , yeah , and the slave . What can I do for you ? Well , sir , I 'm here to play cards . Well , I 'm expecting a few more players in a while . You 're welcome to join us . I don 't want any others . I want you . Well , what 's your stake ? What is it , Sandy ? Looks like a Spanish doubloon . But it can 't be . It would be 300 years old . It 's real . What do you do , polish this thing every day ? It looks brand new . How much is it worth ? About ... Two hundred , I guess . Well , I 'm sorry , sir , you see , two hundred ain 't much of a stake . I play for a $ 5,000 minimum . Two hundred will barely last you for the first deal . That 's if I lose . I 'm not going to lose . Well , I do like a man with confidence . Change it , Sandy . All right . Five card draw . Jacks to open . Five card what ? Draw . Phineas Frog ? Phineas Bogg . SAM : Well , do you think he has a chance ? What are you gonna do ? Two no trump . Does that answer your question ? ( KNOCKING ON WINDOW ) Could you excuse me for a minute ? Oh , yeah , sure , but your cards , they stay . Of course . Yeah . What do you want ? I 'm busy . You 're not supposed to be playing bridge . You 're supposed to be playing poker . Poker ? What 's that ? I thought you said you were a card expert . Yeah , cards , not poker . But poker is cards . You know , three of a kind , straight flush , full house . Snibbitz ! Snibbitz . I played that game in Hungary , learned it from the Gypsies . Bogg , give it up . Harriet 's on board ship , we can break her out . Are you kidding ? Now that I know what game we 're playing , it 's a cinch . Last time I played Snibbitz I won 12 goats . See you later . Bogg , wait ! I know it doesn 't look like it , but he usually knows what he 's doing . You 're right . It doesn 't look like it . I just guess we 're gonna have to do this ourselves . Come on . That must be Harriet 's cabin . We gotta get that guy away from the door . Come on , I have an idea . What a jumper ! Here , froggy . Come here , froggy . Here ... ( CRASHING ) ( CROAKING ) I knew he couldn 't resist Algebra . He 's the best jumper in the state . Come on . Let 's go get the keys to the cabin . JEFFREY : Harriet . What are you ... There 's no time to explain . We 're going to help you escape . But you boys are going to get into a lot of trouble . Let us handle that . Come on . Hey ! You hold it right there . Hold it ! Stop ! Hey ! JEFFREY : We got to jump , Harriet . I 'd jump in a fire if I had to . You boys best bring her back here . JEFFREY : Quick , grab a pole . Let 's get out of here . MAN : You don 't bring her back here , you boys are in big trouble . Come on . Pole , pole ! I 'm poling , I 'm poling . Well , now , don 't look so down , Mr. Bogg , you did win a few hands . It 's been a very pleasant evening . I 'm going to make a comeback . You have to keep playing . Oh , no , I don 't . Excuse me , Mr. Bastaine . Yes ? Sir , your slave has escaped . Oh , not again . There 's a posse chasing her down right now . She won 't get far . That slave is more trouble than she 's worth . I wish I 'd won me a horse . Yes , sir . Well , I ain 't gonna lose any sleep over no good-for-nothing slave girl . You tell that sheriff he 's got my permission to hang her . Wait a minute . You can 't do that ! Oh , sure I can . I own her . Okay , if you feel that way , why not play me a game of cards for her ? Listen , I won that woman from her former master when he used her to cover my $ 500 raise and I figure that 's what she 's worth to me . And it looks like you got what , less than $ 20 there . $ 20 and this . What in the world is this ? BOGG : A very rare pocket watch . I guarantee you 'll never see another like it . What 's that red light ? Aren 't those Swiss watchmakers amazing ? I don 't know , Mr. Bastaine , but there 's no telling what this thing is worth . I mean , it 's one of a kind . Well , I figure it 's worth about as much as that pain in the neck slave girl that I 'm just gonna hang anyway . So I tell you what , Mr. Bogg . One hand of showdown , your watch against my slave girl now . Five cards face up , ( BEEPING ) Best hand wins . I still don 't see why we didn 't stay on the raft . The only way that raft can go is downriver . And downriver is south . And that gets us deeper in slave territory . I got a place up the road that we can stay for the night . We can 't stop now . We got to keep going . She 's right . The only way we can get Harriet to freedom is on foot . But I ain 't going deeper in those woods at night . Crazy Indian out there , who picks up people and eats them alive . There 's worse things than man-eating Indians . The Indian is only half of it . There 're snakes and quicksand . It 's dangerous enough by daylight . Nighttime is suicide . I should 've known . Queens have always given me trouble . ( WOLF HOWLING ) What 's that ? Could be Indians . Maybe even pirates . You have some imagination . ( WOLF HOWLING ) I hope . ( SHUSHING ) When you 're on the run , every sound makes your skin crawl . How many times you been on the run ? Lots . I 'm trying to get back to Maryland . Join a thing called the Underground Railroad to help slaves like me get to the North . Heck , you don 't need no railroad . We 'll get you your freedom . I 'm not going to the railroad to be free . I 'm going to work to help other slaves win their freedom . Slavery ... It 's the worst thing one human being can put on another . I won 't rest until there 's no such thing as slaves . ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) I hear footsteps . It 's Indian Joe ! No , son , it 's the law . Bat 's breath ! Well , not shaping up too well for you , Mr. Bogg . Yeah , well , I still have another card coming , so why don 't you just deal it ? SAM : My ma was right , I 'm headed for an early grave . HARRIET : I 'm sorry , boys , I really am . I never thought that anybody but me would have to sacrifice for my freedom . If I had to , Harriet , I 'd do it all over again . Yeah , me , too . Well , heck , there 's something extravagant about being hung at the age of 12 . Well , good work , Sheriff . Well , what do you want to do with them , Mr. Bastaine ? Hang them ? BOGG : Nobody 's going to be hung . Bogg ! You 're friends with these two boys , aren 't you ? That 's right . So maybe you had something to do with this little escape . Most definitely . Okay . Take him , too , boys . Except for one thing . She 's not a slave . JEFFREY : What ? What are you talking about ? She 's a free woman . He 's right , Sheriff . He won her from me a couple of hours ago in a game . That fool woke up the Justice of the Peace just to sign her freedom papers . Let them go , all of them . But , Sheriff ... Let them go . The law 's the law . You can 't hold a free person if they haven 't broken the law . Bogg , you did it ! Yeah . Pulled a full house of three ladies . Praise the Lord . Bogg , I 'm really sorry I doubted you . I should have known all along you could do it . Jeffrey , you are as stubborn as a mule . You had to go out there and do it your own way , no matter what anybody says or how it might turn out , just because you thought it was right . I like that . You act like a real voyager . ( SHIP HORN BLOWING ) HARRIET : Well , I want to thank you for my boat ticket and my new dress . But I feel bad you spent all your money on it . That 's okay , we don 't need money where we 're going . So , how does it feel to finally be free ? I 've always felt free in my heart , and I always will , but I 'm still a slave . No , you 're not , I won you fair and square . Now , you all have been wonderful to me , and I appreciate everything you 've done , but that gambler wasn 't my master or the man before him . I ran away from my real master in Maryland , and he still owns me . So you 're still a runaway . And these are useless . No , no . Not to me they 're not . With these at least people will think I 'm free . And I can get back to Maryland and help people gain their true freedom . ( SHIP HORN BLOWING ) Boat 's leaving . Bye , everybody . I 'll never forget what you done . Bye ! You 're gonna make it , Harriet , I know you will . She 's gonna be a great woman . She already is . WOMAN : Sam ? Sam Clemens ? It 's my mother . She 's gonna kill me . You better get back this minute ! I haven 't been home since yesterday . And I left a catfish in the washtub . See you later , fellows . Sam Clemens ! Somebody special ? Only my favorite writer in the whole world , Mark Twain . You know , Huckleberry Finn ? Huckleberry who ? You know , Huck and Tom Sawyer . They take this runaway slave down the river on a raft and ... Hey , wait a minute . Green light . Time to get back to Rome . Spartacus needs us . But , Bogg , that 's just what we did ... Say goodbye to Hannibal . Goodbye . ( PLUMMETING ) Bogg ? ( EXCLAIMS ) I hope I didn 't wake you . You big hunk of slave . How did you know I was dreaming about you ? Bogg ! Not now , kid . Now , Bogg ! So the runaway has returned to entertain my sister . And in another strange costume . I can explain , really . Take him ! You , I will spare . Because I do not wish to break my little girl 's heart . For some unknown reason she has an attachment for you . But for your friend , I 'm giving him the opportunity to entertain all of Rome . In the arena ? Of course . A fight to the death with our greatest gladiator . I can 't make up my mind who I 'd rather see die . You or Spartacus . CICERO : Your slave did attract the people of Rome to the arena . SPARTACUS : When I heard you two had escaped , I was filled with hope . I thought for certain I 'd hear that a slave revolt had taken place in Capua . BOGG : It 's still gonna happen , and you 're gonna lead it . My friend , you don 't understand . We fight each other today in the arena . It 's a fight to the death . One of us must die . It won 't come to that . I promise . If the Romans suspect we 're not fighting with all our strength , they 'll have us crucified . Believe me . It 's easier to die by the sword . No , Jeffrey , absolutely not ! But I told you , Calpurnia , you 're our only chance . I helped you escape once , and if guards had caught you , I would have lost you forever . But I told you I 'd come back , and I did . Besides , we 're talking about the lives of two people . We can 't let them die in the arena . If I help your friends escape , do you promise to stay here with me ? I can 't promise you that . Besides , a good friend doesn 't do favors with strings attached . It 's hard being a good friend . It 's even harder leaving one . ( CROWD CHEERING ) When are the gladiators coming out ? CICERO : Bring them . ( CROWD CHEERING ) This is unbelievable . What a turnout ! The Romans enjoy their spectacles . Today they want to see blood . We who are about to die , salute you . Let it begin . It 's time to do battle . Just make it look good for a while . I 'm gonna get you out of this . Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Get up , you must fight . Fight ! Fight ! Your gladiator , Bogg , doesn 't seem to be fighting . Oh , he will . He will . CICERO : How about a small wager ? OCTAVIA : As you wish . Get up ! Fight ! See ? I told you he would fight . But that doesn 't mean he will win . Just take it easy , will you ? The Romans want a real fight . If they don 't get it , they 'll kill us both . Come on , kid , where are you ? JEFFREY : Be careful , I don 't want you getting hurt because of me . Don 't worry about me . Oh , Jeffrey , I 'm going to miss you . Hey , I 'm going to miss you , too . But be realistic . The lives of two little people don 't add up to a hill of beans in this crazy republic . I 'll never forget you , Jeffrey . Never . ( CROWD CHEERING ) Oh , fight , Bogg . Fight ! Your slave fights well . Good day . Good day . My slave would like to stand in my father 's chariot . GUARD : Sorry . No one 's allowed on the Senator 's chariot . But my father said I can and I ... Hey , get away from there . JEFFREY : Here 's looking at you , kid . ( YELLING ) CICERO : They seem to be tiring . It won 't be long now . Kill me , my friend . End a slave 's pain . No . Do it now . I 'll make it look like you won valiantly . No ! Kill me , Spartacus . Give the Romans what they want . Always be their slave . ( CROWD BOOING ) Sorry , Romans . You 'll see no one die in the arena today . Take them ! And hang them both from the same cross ! ( YELLING ) JEFFREY : Grab on ! Grab on ! BOGG : It 's about time , kid . What took you so long ? Are you kidding ? Do you know how hard these things are to drive ? JEFFREY : Goodbye , Calpurnia . Goodbye , Jeffrey . I don 't understand why you two can 't come along . You could help me lead the revolt . Slaves only need one leader , Spartacus . Someone they 'll trust and follow . That 's you . I 'll do my best . Goodbye , my friend . How does it turn out , kid ? Is the slave revolt a success ? Not exactly . Spartacus and his followers fought bravely , but the Roman army was just too strong for them and they were defeated . The toughest part of the job . Every story in history doesn 't have a happy ending . I guess we went to a lot of trouble for nothing . Nothing ? Spartacus didn 't die for nothing , Bogg . He inspired slaves everywhere to try to be free . Slaves like Harriet Tubman . Spartacus would have liked that . Yeah . You know , we deserve a vacation . Let 's go to a time zone where we know that there 's nothing wrong . All right ! Where to ? The Orient ? Tahiti ? ( DINGS ) Hannibal ! Hannibal ? What for ? Snibbitz . I gotta win my lucky coin back . You don 't even have a stake to get back into the game . We 'll sell our clothes . Look , I 'll win us enough to take a first-class vacation , anywhere you want . It 's a cinch , kid . Yeah , it 's a cinch . I 'm not going to let you do it . BOGG : Hey ! Jeffrey , come back here ! Smart kids give me a pain . JEFFREY ... If you would like to learn more about Spartacus , Harriet Tubman or Mark Twain , alias Sam Clemens , take a voyage down to your public library . It 's all in books ! Soon our fight for independence will be over . What about Teddy Roosevelt and the Rough Riders ? I 'm afraid you 've got your facts mixed up , son . He was the 22nd victim of Billy the Kid . What ? BILLY : Throw that shotgun down . How dare you terrorize innocent people . You haven 't heard the last from me . ( WHISPERS ) Looks like we found him . Please don 't do this , Mr. Roosevelt . We will draw our guns and the best man will be left standing . The way I see it , he 's no man at all . Bogg , look out ! BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! MANUEL : We must hurry . We have to reach the jungle before the Spanish soldiers come . RITA : What about the Americans ? The Spanish will capture them . Forget the Americans . Worry about your own people . You didn 't talk like that when the Americans first arrived . Then , they were your brothers . Then , they weren 't defeated . Besides , those two you want to go back for aren 't even soldiers . They are newsmen , here to report the spilled blood of the Cubans . The war has turned you cold , Manuel . If you won 't go back with me , then I 'll go alone . Rita ! Let her go . She has made her choice . ( PLUMMETING ) Where are we , Bogg ? Someplace with bombs . Let 's find cover . ( CHICKENS CLUCKING ) Oh ! That was a close one . You can say that again . ( BEEPING ) Red light ? What else ? Cuba , 1898 . Cuban Revolution against the Spanish . Hey , this is where Teddy Roosevelt led his charge up San Juan Hill . ( RITA SCREAMING ) ( MUMBLING INCOHERENTLY ) She 's gonna get hit . I 'm going after her . You stay put . Okay . BOGG : Over here ! No , no . ( STAMMERING ) Look , I 'd like to talk , but I think we better get out of here . Come on . Are you two okay ? I 'll let you know when my ears stop ringing . Those bombs can really do a number on your eardrums . You are very brave . It 's all in a day 's work . My name is Rita . Cuban ? Yes . You two Americans ? I am . Bogg here 's sort of international . The bombs are Spanish ? Advance artillery . The soldiers will come next . I take it the Spanish are winning . Yes , soon our fight for independence will be over . My people have suffered long enough . They cannot go on much longer . What about Teddy Roosevelt and the Rough Riders ? Who ? Teddy Roosevelt ? I do not know him . Oh , no . ( WHISPERS ) Didn 't he work for the government ? Not yet , he was in Cuba before he became president . Are there any American soldiers here ? No , they have all retreated . ( TRUMPETS PLAYING ) Shh . The bombs have stopped . Great . It 's terrible . The trumpets mean the soldiers will come next . We better get moving ... No , first , you must help me . There are two Americans in town who will be captured if we don 't get them out of here . I thought you said they all retreated . These are newsmen . They stayed behind . Newsmen ? Bogg , if anybody knows about Roosevelt , they will . Do you know where they are ? Yes , I was going to them right before the bombs started . Let 's go now , just in case they come back . REMINGTON : Where are my sketches ? Is that all you artists care about ? We 're in major trouble here . Can you move your legs ? No . I don 't know if I can move this stuff by myself . ( CHUCKLES ) My luck . I 'm in mortal danger and the only one here to help me is a writer . Great , make jokes . The next one better be in Spanish . Rita ! Thank God ! What happened ? A bomb hit , the roof collapsed right on top of him . All right . Come on , everyone , we 'll have to lift together . ( GRUNTING ) It 's no use . I once knew an old man who said he could move the world if he had a large enough lever . Archimedes ! That 's the guy . Find me a fulcrum . ( REMINGTON GROANS ) Don 't worry , we 'll get you out . When I lift it up , slide him out . Right . JEFFREY : Easy . Easy . You got it ! Yeah . RITA : That 's good . Lift him gently . Come on . My sketches ! You have to understand my friend , he 's an artist . He can 't appreciate it when someone saves his life . But I 'd like to thank you . My name is Davis , this is Remington . No time for thanks right now . We 'd better get moving before the Spanish soldiers get here . I know of a safe place . A barn outside of town . Come on . Those are pictures of our defeat at San Juan Hill . RITA : If you are not a soldier then why are you in Cuba ? Me and the kid are just sort of travelers . We go all over the place . Is he your son ? I wish he was . I just sort of watch after him . You know , like a guardian . Are you married ? ( CHUCKLES ) No . I 've thought about it , a lot . But in my line of work I never stay anyplace long enough to really get to know anyone . Sounds lonely . It is sometimes . But I have the kid and he 's a good friend . Friendship is nice , but it doesn 't compare to the love of a woman . No kidding . Maybe a special woman could convince you to settle down . Well , I 'm willing to have her try . JEFFREY : This is all wrong . Just what I need , another critic . No , I mean the scenes . This isn 't the way it 's supposed to happen . Yeah . Well , that 's what Hearst keeps saying , but I draw the truth . What happened to the Rough Riders ? The Rough Riders ? Yeah , I think they were the first volunteer cavalry group from somewhere out west . Yeah . Texas and Oklahoma . But that bunch got left in Tampa . Teddy Roosevelt , too ? Teddy Roosevelt ? ( SCOFFS ) That rich kid from New York ? He 's not a kid . He 's the colonel in charge of the Rough Riders . I 'm afraid you 've got your facts mixed up , son . Yeah , Roosevelt went west in the summer of 1880 . After he graduated college ? And got himself shot . What ? Yeah , he was the 21st or 22nd victim of Billy the Kid . I did the drawing for the pulps . And that was one of my best sellers . In fact , I think I have a copy of it in here somewhere . Yeah , here it is . " An Easterner Meets Western Justice . " Your people have been fighting for a long time , haven 't they ? Yes . Since I was a young girl . Now , I think it 's finally over . War is very strange . It seems to tear people apart and bring others close together . Yeah . When I see all the pain around me , I just want to reach out to someone for warmth and tenderness . I know just what you mean . Bogg . Bogg ! Bogg , this is real important . Don 't move , I 'll be right back . When you get older , you 're gonna discover what 's really important . I found Teddy Roosevelt . What 's this ? Shot 18 years ago by Billy the Kid . Who 's Billy the Kid ? Are you kidding ? He 's only the most famous outlaw of the Old West . I dressed up like him three Halloweens in a row . Wait a minute . Maybe I have heard of him . Didn 't he shoot a lot of people ? Twenty-one . Now come on , we gotta get there . What about Rita ? You know the voyager code . No romance while the Omni 's red . There 's no code like that . ( BEEPING ) Well , there should be one . At least let me say goodbye to her . Come on . Come on . Up , up . Let 's get on up . Up , up . Oh , dear . Up , up . Oh , dear . ( PLUMMETING ) You could have at least let me say goodbye . Are you kidding ? I 've seen your goodbyes . We didn 't have all year . This doesn 't look like the Old West . And that guy can 't be Billy the Kid . ( BEEPING ) Pennsylvania , 1752 . That 's not what I set the Omni for . Sometimes it gets stuck in the automatic mode . Well , if this is Pennsylvania , 1752 ... Who 's the guy with the kite ? Ben Franklin ! Come on . Mr. Franklin ? Oh , no . Don 't tell me you two have been witnessing this folly . Yeah , it looks like you 're having a little trouble . I 'm having a confounded time getting it off the ground . You 've got a good wind . Yes . There is a storm brewing . That is , if my barometer was accurate this morning . I 'm conducting this experiment to prove that lightning is charged with two kinds of electricity . Well , don 't worry , Mr. Franklin , your experiment will be a success . You 're a great inventor . Well , I don 't know about being a great inventor , but I ... I 'm not a very good kite flyer . This is hopeless . Well , I know why the kite won 't fly . Why ? It 's too heavy . This key is weighing it down . Well , the key acts as a conductor . Yeah , Bogg , he 's gotta have that key . Well , we 'll just have to shorten the tail a little bit to make up for the extra weight . There you are . Yeah , that ought to do it . Hold this for me . Oh , I 'll handle this . I 'm the expert . Okay . Ready ? Uh-huh . Run , Jeffrey ! Good . FRANKLIN : Now up , up , up . That 's it . That 's it . That 's it . He 's got it . He 's got it . He did it . He did it . You 're doing it , kid . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) Just in time , too . Here you are , Mr. Franklin . Thank you very much , young man . I 'm very grateful . Now all I need is a bolt of lightning . Green light . Let 's try Billy the Kid again . Okay . ( PLUMMMETING ) ( EXCLAIMS ) Jeffrey ! Bogg , help ! Hold on , Jeff . I 'm coming . Bogg , I 'm sinking . It 's quicksand . I know . I 'm stuck , too . BILLY : What are you doing down there ? Looks like you guys got yourselves in quite a mess . Well , don 't just sit there , do something . Bogg ! Don 't move , Jeffrey . It makes you sink faster . Hey , come on , mister , give us a hand . The kid 's gonna sink . Come on , will you ? Bogg . Hold on , Jeff . Hold on . JEFFREY : Bogg . Back . Back , boy . That 's it . That 's it . Keep going , boy . ( PANTING ) That was great . How 'd you rope us like that ? Easier than roping a running stallion . I 'm Jeffrey . This is Phineas Bogg . William Bonney . It 's Billy the Kid ! You dressed like him for Halloween ? It was an easy costume . Just be glad he had some extra clothes with him . We better hang around with him a while . He might lead us to Roosevelt . How did you fall into that sand , anyway ? It 's a long story . Where are your horses ? They ran off . Must have got wind of some wild mustang filly . Happens out here all the time . You must know all about horses and roping and stuff . Them that don 't , don 't live long . I 've read about you , Mr. Bonney . You 're famous . Call me Billy . And don 't believe everything you read in those magazines . I ain 't killed half as many men as they think . They just make up stories about you because you 're a legend . You 're laying it on a little thick , don 't you think ? I 'm a legend , am I ? Yeah . I 'll tell you what . Since you two ain 't got horses and I do , you want to ride with me ? All right ! Mount up . Good job , kid . I didn 't know what you were going for at first , but you really conned him into taking us with him . Who was conning ? You mean you really think this guy is a legend ? Bogg , he 's Billy the Kid . Right , the murderer . You heard him . He hasn 't shot half the people they say he has . One is too many . Okay , okay . But maybe he shot them in self defense . Maybe they were murderers . Maybe they weren 't . We 're gonna stop here for a spell . Why ? I 'm waiting for my men . ( SNAKE RATTLING ) Look out ! Wow ! That was fast ! I wish I could do that . You mean you haven 't learned to shoot yet ? I 've never even picked up a gun before . Well , not a real one at least . Then I 'm gonna show you how . I got some tins of beans in my saddle bags . Make good targets . Wait a minute . I don 't think that 's a good idea . He 's gotta learn sometime . He can 't survive out here without knowing how to use a gun . Come on , Bogg . Would you excuse us a minute ? Bogg , how many kids get the chance to learn how to shoot from Billy the Kid ? None , I hope . We 're just gonna be shooting tin cans . No way . Please , Bogg , it 'll be a good experience . I said no ! That 's final . Here you go . Try your hand at it , kid . I can 't . Why not ? Bogg won 't let me . Hey , I don 't want to get between a boy and his father . He 's not my father . But he tells you what to do ? Look , I take care of him , I just don 't want him to shoot a gun . Hey , that 's okay by me . Except when I was Jeffrey 's age , I was on my own . I learned how to shoot . And after that no one told me what to do . We heard some shooting . Figured it might be trouble . No , no trouble , Charley . Just showing off a little . Ned , Coley . This is Jeffrey and that 's Bogg . Hi . They 'll be riding with us . Did you forget we 've a stagecoach coming through in an hour ? No one said anything about extra splits on the divvy . Now they stay behind . Are you taking over , Charley ? What , you guys been planning something behind my back ? No , Billy , I swear , we ain 't planned nothing . He 's telling the truth , Billy . A man have to be crazy to cross you . Now that 's the smartest thing you ever said , Charley . And it just saved your life . Okay , everybody mount up . We 've got a stagecoach to rob . Billy 's got himself a mean temper . Yeah , well , I 've seen you lose yours before . Not like that . Hey , wait a minute . We can 't go along on a stagecoach robbery . You want to find Teddy , don 't you ? We 've gotta stay with Billy . All right , but we have to stay out of it . We can 't get involved in a hold-up . Will you stop treating me like a kid ? I know what I 'm doing . That kid 's asking for it . ( YELLS ) Whoa ! BILLY : Hold it right there ! Take it easy . And you throw that shotgun down . Here , you keep an eye on it . Take the gun , Jeffrey . I need you to keep an eye on the passengers . You touch that gun and you 'll find yourself in an orphanage in another time zone . Suit yourself , kid . Ned , get the money bag . Oh , my ! Oh , my ! First Indians , now outlaws . This is an awful place . There , there , Maggie . Everything is going to be just fine . Oh , Mr. Roosevelt . ( WHISPERS ) Looks like we found him . Yeah . Who 's in charge here ? Who 's the leader of this gang ? I guess you could say I am . You 're gonna die , mister . How dare you terrorize innocent people . You don 't understand me . You are gonna die , right here , right now , in front of all these people . Nobody hits Billy the Kid and lives to brag about it . So , you 're Billy the Kid , are you ? You 're even less impressive in person . Kind of puny , if you ask me . You 're asking to die . Charley , give him your gun . Take it . The unwritten code of the West , huh ? Okay to shoot a man with a gun in his hand ? I have nothing but disgust for you and all outlaws like you . Put it in his hand , Charley . It 's very kind of you , Charley , but no thanks . If Billy wants to shoot me , he 'll have to do it in cold blood . No ! Okay , if that 's the way you want it . ( GUN FIRING ) My finger slipped . I guess I got kind of tense . It 's been one of those days . Let 's get out of here , Billy . This guy 's not worth it . You 're a legend . Legends don 't shoot unarmed men . Yeah ? Yeah . Yeah , okay , kid . Today , I 'll be a legend . Okay , boys , load them up . Watch your step , Maggie . This is your lucky day . You haven 't heard the last from me , William Bonney . Please , Mr. Roosevelt . You don 't want to die . Just get in the stagecoach . Please . Okay , son . But you should be more careful about the friends you choose . MAGGIE : Mr. Roosevelt , let 's go back to New York where we belong . Hey , move them out . Go back into town and see if that yellow-bellied Sheriff 's got a posse out after us . You came through , kid . I knew when it came down to it , you would . Now do you think Billy is such a big hero ? I knew he wouldn 't shoot him . I told you he 's not as bad as you think he is . After what you just saw ? Look , I don 't care now . We saved Roosevelt and now we can get out of here . ( BEEPING ) It still can 't be red . I guess we just gotta stick around a little bit longer . Mr. Roosevelt ? Yes , Maggie . I 've been your housekeeper now for five years . And in all that time I 've tried to keep my nose where it belongs . Yes , Maggie , you are a wonderful woman . Please , Mr. Roosevelt , let 's get out of this town and go back east . Right now , right away . We 've just arrived . I know , and already we have been attacked by Indians , and you have almost been shot by a dangerous outlaw . That 's exactly why we can 't leave . I don 't understand . You can 't expect me to leave when an outlaw like that roams free . You know my stand on law and order , Maggie . I won 't rest till that man is behind bars . But you don 't even live here . We are all citizens of the world , Maggie . Every person has an obligation , no matter where he is , to keep the peace . Mr. Roosevelt , you can 't fight this outlaw by yourself . He 's a killer . This town has a sheriff , doesn 't it ? And good , upstanding citizens . I won 't be alone , Maggie . No , I will unite this town into one large peace-keeping force . Mark my words . Billy the Kid is finished . That man is gonna get himself killed . SHERIFF : I can 't believe that the Kid didn 't shoot you . Well , he shot others for a lot less . I have a young boy to thank for that . He talked Billy out of it , and I must say he convinced me not to be so bullheaded . What you did wasn 't bullheaded . It took real courage . Sheriff , I 'm a man who believes in law and order . I 'd rather die than see outlaws like that take over . I felt the same way , but when I was younger . But now , I wouldn 't stand a chance against someone like Billy . You don 't have to stand alone , Sheriff . Not when you have good citizens that cherish peace and justice . If you give me the authority , I 'll round up a posse and go after that outlaw . I 'll end his terrorizing once and for all . Oh , I 'll give you the authority , but I don 't know how easy it will be to round up a posse . People around here like peace , but when it comes to justice , they 'd rather someone else take care of it . You underestimate them , Sheriff . Good citizens of this community , can I have your attention please ? ( ALL CHATTERING ) Good citizens of this community , you have , no doubt , all heard by now about my confrontation with Billy the Kid . The sheriff has authorized me to organize a posse to go after this cowardly vermin and put an end to his murderous reign , once and for all . I call for volunteers . ( ALL CHATTERING ) Looks like I 'll have to handle this by myself . I don 't know if I should 've let that fellow get away with what he done . You did the right thing , Billy . You gotta understand something . I stay alive because people are too scared to mess with me . It ain 't good people knowing I got hit and didn 't do nothing about it . It wouldn 't have proved anything by shooting an unarmed man . Yeah , maybe not . But it sure would have been a lot easier if you had taken that gun . I gotta check the horses . You still like that guy after what he did yesterday ? Roosevelt hit him . In front of all those people . Oh , that 's good reason to shoot somebody . He didn 't shoot anybody . He stopped because I talked him out of it . Yeah , well , who says you 're gonna be able to stop him next time ? I 'm starting to worry about you . I thought you were smart . I am smart . So why don 't you just lay off the lectures , okay , Bogg ? Probably found himself another stagecoach to rob . I 'm gonna go check it out . It 's a good thing you sent me into town . That Sheriff ain 't doing nothing but that Roosevelt fellow sure is stirring up trouble . What kind of trouble ? He 's been in town all morning trying to get up a posse . And , last night in the saloon , he called you a coward . I knew I should 've taken care of him . What 's going on , Billy ? I gotta go into town to get some supplies . You wanna come ? I gotta ask Bogg . Yeah , if you do , what will he say ? No . But if I don 't , he 'll clobber me . Look , if you have to ask just to go for a little ride , then maybe I should go by myself . But ... Do you have to ask that guy if you can blow your nose ? Come on , kid , cut the strings . It 's time to grow up . We 'll be back before he finishes his coffee . I guess it 'll be all right . Just me and the kid . I don 't want his guardian angel following us . Make sure he doesn 't . Come on . Let 's go . Jeffrey , come back here . Where are they going ? Into town . A little unfinished business . Yeah , Roosevelt 's been alive too long . JEFFREY : Hey , slow down , Billy . You 're going faster and faster . You 're just gonna have to keep up with me , kid . BOGG : How long do we have to sit here ? CHARLEY : Till Billy gets back . A man could go a little crazy hanging around like this . Got anything to liven things up a bit ? Like what ? Whisky ? I bought a new bottle back in town . Wouldn 't be a bad time to open it . It 's in my pack right there . Great . Come to think of it , I don 't even drink . Well , bon voyage . Why that dirty ... Get him . Get him ! Stop him ! Gotta stop here a minute . What for ? What are we gonna do , Billy ? I gotta see someone . ( COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ) Where 's Roosevelt ? Where 's Roosevelt ? I said , where 's Roosevelt ? He hasn 't been in today , Mr. Bonney . Honest . Anybody in here thinking of joining up with that posse he 's starting ? Nobody here . Nobody in the whole town . So that 's what we came to town for . To get Roosevelt . I 'm gonna do what I should 've done yesterday . You can 't ! First he hit me , then he called me a coward . I can 't let that pass . You see the way those people acted when I walked in ? That 's respect . I ain 't gonna lose that . That 's not respect , that 's fear . Yeah , well , that 's close enough . Is that what you really want ? People to be afraid of you ? Kid , that 's what keeps me alive . And every so often you gotta make an example so everybody remembers . If you shoot Roosevelt , it will be murder . Yeah , well , I 'll give him a fair chance . Fair ? You 're 10 times faster than he is and you know it . Kid , out here , that 's called survival . Survival of the fastest . You 're not a legend . You 're just a killer ! You going soft on me , kid ? I guess I am . You know , I used to pretend I was you . Even dress up like you . That was all made-up junk and it 's not fun anymore . That 's too bad . I brought you with me so you could see firsthand a small dose of Western justice . If you ain 't got the stomach for it , maybe you better run along , little boy . Sheriff , Sheriff . Sheriff , you gotta come quick . Billy the Kid is gonna gun down Teddy Roosevelt . Oh , I know . You know ? Well , aren 't you gonna do something ? No . Why not ? It 's Roosevelt 's problem . He got himself into this mess . But he 's gonna be killed . Well , he should 've known better . What kind of sheriff are you ? An old one . And I 've lived this long because I know when to step into something and when to stay out of it . But you have a job . You get paid to keep law and order in this town . When I was young , maybe . But not anymore . I 'm only a year away from retiring and I 'm not about to risk my neck . This town chooses to look the other way when it comes to Billy the Kid , and I choose to do the same . You 're a coward . Son , you have to understand . I 'm no match for Billy . He 'd shoot me down in the wink of an eye . Then two people would die . Me and Roosevelt . Billy 'd just step over my body and go after him anyway . But someone has to stand up to him . Well , someday , somebody will . Hey , Roosevelt . Hey , Roosevelt , I know you 're up there . Show your face . I hear you 've been looking for me . You heard right . Also heard you called me a coward . Right again . You just don 't know when somebody cut you some slack . I want no favors from you , Mr. Bonney . Then come down here and we 'll settle this once and for all . I 'll be right down . Billy , you can 't do this . You can 't . Oh , yeah ? Just watch me . Get away from me , kid . I ain 't got no use for you anymore . Where are you , Bogg ? I need you . Come on . Everybody off the streets . JEFFREY : Bogg ! Hold it . Stop ! What do you think you 're doing ? Putting a stop to this . What , are you crazy ? How do you expect to stop me without a gun ? I don 't need a gun . Yeah , you 're crazy , all right . Now get out of the street before you get shot ! You better heed Mr. Bonney . We will draw our guns and the best man will be left standing . If that 's true then I could tell you right now that Billy is the best man , because if you draw your gun , he 's gonna be the one left standing . And the way I see it , he 's no man at all . Bogg , look out ! JEFFREY : No , Billy , don 't do it . Please . You stay put . He was gonna shoot you in the back . Yeah , Billy is not one for playing fair . I think that was six . I hope that was six . ( CLICKING ) Mr. Roosevelt , Billy would 've killed you . I don 't back down , son . I know that . I also know your country needs you . I can 't tell you how I know , but I do . You 're going to mean a lot to this country 's history . Now , please , go back east where you belong . All right , son , I 'll leave . Maybe I can redeem myself by knowing when to walk away . I 'd like to thank you . And I hope to meet you both again someday . Goodbye . ( BILLY GRUNTING ) Don 't even try to move . You 're gonna die . You 're forgetting something . I got the gun . Come to think of it , I don 't need this . Give me a gun . Somebody give me a gun . I 'm Billy the Kid . Billy 's not much without his gun , is he ? Come back here . I mean it ! Not much with it , either . ( CRYING ) I 'm sorry , Bogg . I was stupid . I could 've ruined everything . I could 've got Roosevelt killed . All I care about is you 're okay . You learned a good lesson . So did I. What 's that ? That even though you act grown up , you 're still a kid . ( DINGS ) A pretty good kid . We 're on our way to Cuba . Where 'd they go ? ( SOLDIER SHOUTING ) Where are your men , Colonel ? You are captured , yet only this little rebel girl comes to your aid ? This little rebel girl will have your life if she ever gets free . I hope you exhibit such bravery when you stand in front of the firing squad . My men will come soon , you can be sure of that . They 'll give you a taste of your own medicine . ( WIND WHISTLING ) ( GRUNTS ) Excuse me . Bully ! I knew someone would come . I 've seen you two before . I don 't think so . Rita ? How do you know my name ? The rebels sent us . I knew my people would send someone for me . Good people , these Cubans . Take care of their own . Roosevelt ever captured ? I don 't think so . Yep . Red light . Mr. Roosevelt , where are your troops ? We were headed to San Juan Hill when I was cut off from them . That 's when I was captured . We have to get him back there , Bogg . The streets are filled with Spanish soldiers . We wouldn 't get 10 feet . I need a diversion . What are you gonna do , Bogg ? Stir things up outside . When you hear the first explosion , you and Rita get Roosevelt out of town . Bogg , be careful . It 's a matter of routine , kid . I 'll be at San Juan Hill with you before Teddy can yell " charge . " I think it 's time to wake this town up a little . Bombs away . ( PEOPLE CLAMORING ) It 's all clear . Let 's go . RITA : War is a strange thing . BOGG : Yeah . Tears people apart , brings others closer together . So true . Like us . No . Like my people . This war has united us like never before . With the help of Americans like you and Mr. Roosevelt , we will gain our independence . Oh , yeah , well , that , too . Thank you , Mr. Bogg . I will never forget what you have done . Now I must join the rebels . There is much more that needs to be done . Goodbye . Yeah , goodbye . I liked her in the other time zone better . Bogg ! Bogg , Mr. Roosevelt let me review the troops . And a bully job he did , too ! That 's great , kid . This could be a very decisive battle . We must take that hill . You will , Mr. Roosevelt . I know it . Thank you both . Nothing more to say then . Charge ! On to San Juan Hill . ( DINGS ) It 's green . I think we 're finally off the hook . How did things turn out with Rita ? Oh , fine . Fine . But , you know , she has this war and all that so ... Got dumped , huh ? Yeah . JEFFREY ... If you wanna learn more about Billy the Kid , Teddy Roosevelt or the Spanish-American war take a voyage down to your public library . It 's all in books ! Speak to us . Spirits of darkness . ( PLUMMETING ) What ? Do something , get me out of here ! I 'm Harry Houdini . You are from the other side . ( GIRLS SCREAMING ) Behold the power of God , Satan . I really think this is just a misunderstanding . Today we stand trial and tomorrow we shall meet our maker . What have we done ? JUDGE : You are found guilty of the charge of practicing witch craft . BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! MAN 1 : Do not let her escape ! ( SCREAMING ) Catch the devil witch ! ( BARKING ) MAN 2 : Let the dogs lead , follow the dogs . There is no running from the lord , Abiah Folger . Over there ! The witch runs toward the rocks ! There she is . Get her ! ( SCREAMS ) GIRL : The witch . She chokes me . She possesses my soul . ( GIRLS SCREAMING ) You see what the witch does ? She is an instrument of Satan ! Be these accusations true , Abiah Folger ? I 'm as innocent as an unborn child . You are a witch ! I am a victim . I am a victim of thy daughter 's imagination , Reverend Parris . The witch stabs me with her eyes . Seize her ! No , I 'm innocent . Please . Please , I 'm innocent . Oh , good Lord , help me . ( PLUMMETING ) ( GROANS ) Bat 's breath ! It 's bad enough we landed in the dark , but I got to introduce my rear end to this rock that looks like the Matterhorn . Bogg . Look at that , will you ? Forget it , Bogg . Look at that . Oh , no . Behold the power of God , Satan ! You are impotent in the face of our Lord . Look , I really think this is just a misunderstanding . Please help me ! They 'll kill me ! Take them ! Come on , kid ! Run ! The devils head for the rocks ! After them . JEFFREY : Where 're we going , Bogg ? BOGG : Up . BOGG : Hurry , around the back . This cave leads somewhere ? I 'm not sure . Bogg ? So she 's not sure . You got a better idea ? Burn , devils ! Burn ! JEFFREY : Be careful , Bogg . Not bad . I 'll give him a 5.7 . Will you can the diving jokes ? Let 's get out of here . Hey , it looks like a passageway around the ... Surrender to the Lord , Satan . JEFFREY : This is perfect . Just perfect . BOGG : Look , I said I was sorry . Yeah , but I can 't believe this . What an entrance . Right in the middle of a Salem witch hunt . Can 't you control that thing ? Doesn 't come with a steering wheel . What 's the date ? ( BEEPING ) November 13th , 1692 . Friday ? It is . Figures . November ? Bogg , we studied this last year in school . The last Salem witches were hung in September 1692 . That was the end of it . ABIAH : The end ? I do not know what school you attend , but believe me , this is just the beginning . Today we stand trial and tomorrow we shall meet our maker . That is the pattern . What have we done ? I cannot speak for you . But in my case , I did publicly denounce these trials and those wicked little girls who started them . You mean , those screaming kids from last night ? Yes . My teacher said it was like rock and roll . A way the kids rebelled against their parents and the strict way the Puritans lived . Only this version 's a lot deadlier . ( ABIAH SOBBING ) I cannot believe this is happening . Abby , we 'll help you . How can you ? Unless it 's true . What 's true ? Before you came from the sky , I asked for help from heaven . Your clothing , your speech , your objects . Art thou from heaven ? Or are you from hell ? NOYES : And from whence did these two beings come ? From the darkness you say . I say , from hell . CROWD : Yeah ! Yeah ! These agents of Satan came . Dropped from the sky by the witch , Folger beckoned . The witch hurt me ! ( ALL SCREAMING ) You know it 's not true . You know it ! The witch hurt me ! Do you really believe we came from hell ? This is ridiculous . Are you denying that you fell from the sky ? It seems to me that angels fall from the sky . And do angels wear such immodest clothing ? Oh , you got to be kidding ! NOYES : And they speak with such strange tongues ? CROWD : No ! Give me a break . If this is not the work of Satan , then God is not in his heaven above . ( BEEPING ) Agents of Satan ! Agents of Satan ! And they should be punished as such ! ( SCREAMING ) ( GAVEL POUNDING ) That guy 's a regular Clarence Darrow . What 're they gonna do to us , Bogg ? Nothing , if we can get that Omni back . ( GAVEL POUNDING ) The accused will step down and approach the bench for sentencing . Aren 't we allowed a defense ? CROWD : No ! No ! There is no defense for crimes against the Lord . Step down ! ( CROWD MURMURING ) Abiah Folger , you are found guilty of the charge of practicing witchcraft in the town of Salem . And you are hereby sentenced to hang by the neck until dead , at noon on the morrow . JEFFREY : You can 't do this to us . ( CROWD CHATTERING ) ( GAVEL POUNDING ) As to your two agents ... I 'll confess to anything . Just spare the woman and the boy . CROWD : No ! No ! The devil comes in many shapes and sizes . The witch summoned both of you and you both shall pay the price . He 's just a kid . ( CROWD YELLING ) This court is not without mercy . The boy is hereby ordered to Duxbury Prison , where he is sentenced to spend the remainder of his days on earth . No ! He is additionally sentenced , as is the witch , to watch your death , agent of Satan , and that death is to be without precedent in these colonies . ( CROWD CLAMORING ) I hereby decree that at the stroke of midnight this night , you shall be burned to death at the stake . Fire shall fight fire ! ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) JEFFREY : Will I just die , Bogg ? I mean , really ? BOGG : We 're regular flesh and blood , kid . Only thing that makes us special is that Omni . ABIAH : Do you mean your device could save us ? If I could get my hands on it . But I 'm not holding my breath . I think I 'll never see Josiah again . Josiah ? Josiah Franklin , my betrothed . He 's a candle maker from Boston . Franklin ? I wonder when he 'll hear of this . Benjamin Franklin , Bogg . Josiah . Josiah Franklin was a candle maker in Boston . He and his wife Abiah had a son . Benjamin . Benjamin Franklin ? You mean the guy with the granny glasses and the long , wavy hair ? I do not understand . Benjamin ? Signed the Declaration of Independence , was ambassador to France . That 's where I met him . You know , for being a dumpy kind of guy , he sure had a way with the women . Yeah , well , you 're looking at his mother . Mother ? Are you saying I have a child ? You would 've if we could 've gotten you out of here . And right now that seems like the most unlikely thing in the world . JEFFREY : Bogg . They can 't do it , Bogg . I don 't think we can stop them . But we didn 't do anything . That 's right , kid . Just like all the other witches . Bring him forward . ( SOBBING ) Bring the devil to his end now ! Bogg ! We 'll see each other sometime . Bogg , you can 't . You can 't . Don 't let them do it . Just know you 're the best thing that ever happened to me , kid . Out of all the people in time , the best . Take care of him for me , will you ? At least , as long as you can . Tie him ! No ! JEFFREY : No , don 't ! Don 't ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Stop it ! Any final words ? How can you people be so blind ? Blind ? Murdering innocent people in the name of God . This is not murder , devil ! We are merely returning you from whence you came . Light the fire ! No ! Don 't ! Stop ! ABIAH : You can 't be doing this . You can 't burn people like this ! You can 't ! It 's not right ! We 're not witches . No ! Stop it ! Will Satan help you , devil ? Or do you need this talisman to set you free ? ( LAUGHING ) Burn , devil . Burn ! ALL : Burn , devil , burn ! Burn , devil , burn ! ( GIRLS SCREAMING ) He vanished ! MAN : The devils have vanished . Such is the power of Satan ! We are seeking contact with the other side . Come to us . Speak to us . Speak through me to these people . Who are you ? I am Harry Houdini . And I don 't believe any of this . Then what do you want of me ? I want you to give me a sign . Something to prove you are from the other side . Give me a sign , or I 'm going to get up and leave . A sign ! ( PLUMMETING ) ( SCREAMING ) WOMAN : He 's not from here ! Where the heck are we ? Out , get me out ! Do something , get me out of here ! Where did they come from ? Please ! Get me out of here ! I lost the Omni ! Boston , 1924 . Green light . Let 's get out of here . I 'm Harry Houdini . You are from the other side . You are the sign . ( BEEPING ) BOGG : Jeffrey , get over here with that . Let 's go . Come on . Come on , kid . ( PLUMMETING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( SIGHS ) Nice . Kid , you were wonderful back there . The way you jumped into the fire like that . I 'm really proud . Yeah , well , I think we got a problem , Bogg . No , we don 't . Believe me . To smell like a rotten halibut 's a lot better than to smell like a charbroiled t-bone . ( BEEPING ) 1814 , Baltimore . Just fine with me . Red light and all . Yeah , well , take a good long look and kiss it goodbye . That was Harry Houdini back there . Who ? Harry Houdini . The greatest escape artist who ever lived . We got to go back . Go back ? To that dark room with all those screaming maniacs ? You think I 'm crazy ? It was a s√©ance . Whatever it was , it was a waste of time . We got to go back to Salem and Abby . After we fix Houdini . I don 't think I 'm getting through to you . Look , the Omni had a green light when we landed . So we landed in a green zone . We sure didn 't have time to set it in the fire . It turned red before we left . It did ? That 's what I 'm trying to tell you . When Houdini saw us , he thought we were ghosts . I 'm not following this , kid . Look , when he wasn 't performing , Houdini used to go around the country exposing phony s√©ances . What we did when we dropped in was make him believe the s√©ance was real . So what ? We made one guy believe in ghosts . Don 't you see ? It could change his whole life . What if he gives up magic ? What if he makes millions of people believe that the phony s√©ances are real ? I 'm sorry , kid . I just don 't think it 's that big a deal . What is it ? Just a poem . " Oh , say , can you see by the dawn 's early light , what so proudly we hailed ... " At the twilight 's last gleaming . How 'd you know ? Mr. Key ! Mr. Key ! Good morning , my enthusiastic young man . Good morning , sir . You dropped this . ( EXCLAIMS ) I wrote this when the British were rowing me ashore this morning . It was a proud sight , son . Those stars and stripes still flying over McHenry . I wrote this to help me remember . To help us all remember . Pardon me ? Have a nice day , sir . I will . And thank you . What was that all about ? Oh , that poem you were going to throw away ? Yeah ? Those were the lyrics to our national anthem . That was Francis Scott Key . Oh . It 's no big deal , Bogg . Right . Well , I ... I guess we 'd better crack this little Houdini problem , huh ? Yeah . ( PLUMMETING ) Bat 's breath ! Ow ! Can 't you get that thing to come up with a better place to land ? You 're lucky it wasn 't the roof . This the same room ? Gives me the creeps . See if you can go find some lights . Why me ? I 'm just a kid . Come on . We 'll do it together . Stay where you are . Who are you ? Jeffrey Jones and Phineas Bogg . What do you want ? We want to see Harry Houdini . Stay where you are . I don 't think that 's necessary . Look , a secret passageway . And the ghost was a reflection on the glass . I 've shown you my secret . Now you show me yours . ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ON PHONOGRAPH ) I love your costumes . So realistic . Houdini 's absolutely convinced . He 's holding a press conference here tomorrow morning to announce to the world that he is giving up magic . Houdini 's giving up magic ? And his escape tricks and his illusions . The fool actually believes that I can conjure up ghosts . He says his magic is nothing next to the reality of what I can do . What we can do . I don 't drink . Then neither will I. There 's going to be a rebirth of mentalism because of this . And I 'm going to be the richest and most famous one of all . To think that just a few hours ago I was on the brink of destruction . Houdini would have ruined me if it hadn 't been for you . Thank you . ( CLEARING THROAT ) Excuse me . Where is he ? Houdini ? He 's at his hotel back in town . But we can 't let him see either one of you now , can we ? Wouldn 't think of it . Good . We 'll discuss your price after the press conference . In the meantime , I 'm leaving a couple of my men outside your door . I wouldn 't want you to disappear . Oh , I don 't know what this is , but I 'll hold onto it for a while until I find out . Great kisser . ( CHUCKLES ) ( DOOR CLOSES ) Great kisser . You 're really having a tough time hanging onto that thing , aren 't you ? Will you knock it off ? How was I supposed to know she was a pickpocket ? What happens if she presses the button ? It 's set to this time and place . She won 't go anywhere as long as she doesn 't touch the dials . Monkey suit still out there ? ( SIGHING ) Yep ! ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) Hey , I think that 's him . Houdini ? Where ? All he 'd have to do is just see one of us and he 'd know we weren 't really ghosts . You know something ? What ? We 've been locked up in here a pretty long time . All right . One at a time . Kid first . Okay , kid . Bogg ! The kid ! Get the kid ! My cake ! Reality . You 've completely altered my understanding of the word . Next to last night 's experience , this rose , life . Simply nothing . ( CHUCKLING ) I hope you don 't mind if I 'm telling the press that I 'll be studying with you . I mean , if you 'll accept me , that is . I am truly awed by your achievement . And I am truly flattered , Mr. Houdini . Please . Harry . Harry . JEFFREY : Mr. Houdini ! Mr. Houdini ! Mr. Houdini ! Mr. Houdini ! It 's the boy . It 's me . The kid from last night . I 'm not a ghost . So you aren 't , and I 'm certainly a fool . How fortunate that you 're holding a press conference . By this time tomorrow the whole country will know you for the fraud that you are . I seriously doubt that , Harry . By this time tomorrow , you and your little ghost here will be gone . You really think the press is gonna buy this ? Oh , come on , Harry . They 'll love it . It 's already on the front page of the evening edition . " Houdini 's Mysterious Disappearance . " A trip to the netherworld . We 're holding a s√©ance for you as soon as we get back . Ready , Margaret . Gentlemen . It is customary for magicians to pass on their tricks before they die . Now , do you want to tell me about this ? I pushed the button and nothing happens . I thought you were more sophisticated than that . It 's just a prop . Just part of the illusion . I 'll keep it as a souvenir . Phineas . ( CLICKING TONGUE ) You really are a great kisser . Oh , Harry . This is to help you appreciate the drama . You were always big on drama . When the flame goes out , so do you . ( OWL HOOTING ) Think of it as a challenge , gentlemen . Let 's see you get out of this one . ( HAMMERING ) Double-jointed . I can get out of any shackle made . Can you get us out of this ? Do you know how many times I 've been buried alive ? How many death-defying situations I 've put myself in ? ( KNOCKING ) I know , I 've read about them all . This is a piece of cake , right ? With a steam shovel and a crowbar it 's a piece of cake . See , all of my buried alive acts , they were illusions , son . This is real . I 'm sorry . ( LAUGHING ) What 's so funny ? Now we 'll never get back to Abby . The man said we 're gonna check out . This is it . ( LAUGHING ) He 's crazy . No , he 's not . What he is , is a great kisser . Yeah , I guess . We seek Harry Houdini . Oh , spirits of darkness is he with you ? Speak to us . Speak to us ! Where is Houdini ? ( PLUMMETING ) ( MONKEY SCREECHING ) ( PEOPLE CLAMORING ) The blindfold stays on ! Stay down . BOGG : These natives sure are restless . What was that ? What 's happening ? ( BEEPING ) You don 't want to know . Can 't you set that thing any faster ? I 'm trying . You want us to miss again ? Come to us , spirit of darkness . Speak to us . Speak to us ! MAN : What do you want of me ? MARGARET : We are trying to find someone . Are you able to help us ? Who are you seeking ? Give me a name . ( PLUMMETING ) Houdini . Where is Harry Houdini ? WOMAN : Not again ! Houdini . How ? There was yelling . It was bright . An illusion ? It was an illusion . Yes . A brilliant illusion . Ladies and gentlemen , I give you Harry Houdini . ( ALL CLAPPING ) Ladies and gentlemen , thank you , thank you . Nothing gives me greater pleasure than exposing a fraud . But tonight , I have the added distinction of exposing both a fraud and a criminal . This very evening this woman attempted to bury me and my companions alive . Oh , you wretched woman . HARRY : My friends were ghosts , she held them against their will . Despite the fact that they wanted to reveal this ... We 're not gonna go now are we ? Green light , kid . I don 't want Houdini asking any embarrassing questions . But ... No buts . You and I are needed back in Salem . But how did you do it ? How did you get out , Harry ? My dear friend , a good magician never reveals his secrets . Did we not see what Satan did when faced with justice from our Lord ? CROWD : Yes ! Have we anything to fear ? CROWD : No ! Then I think we should eliminate that which brought Satan to Salem . Hang this woman . Hang this witch now . At once . No , no ! ALL : Hang her ! Hang her ! Where are your devils now , witch ? Why aren 't they here to save you ? ( ALL LAUGHING ) ( PLUMMETING ) They 're here ! Come on , kid ! The devils head for the rocks ! After them ! Get them ! Some of you men come with me . ABIAH : I cannot understand how you can be in the fire one moment and gone from sight the next . ( SCREAMS ) Don 't leave me . I don 't think we 've time to talk about it right now . Why are we going up here anyway ? Didn 't this get us caught before ? You got a better idea and I 'll stop to listen . In the meantime , climb . They 're making for the cave ! Go around the other side . In there ! Come on , we got to do it before they get around the rock . Do what ? It 'll take us forever ... Oh , no . One , two ... Surely you aren 't going to ... Geronimo ! They can 't get away . MAN : Where 'd they go ? Where ... Where did they go ? Do you have them ? It appears the devils are gone . Okay , come on up . Are they gone ? For the time being . That was a good trick , kid . Thanks . I saw it once in a movie . What 's a movie ? Yeah , see , these guys , they 're escaping from prison . It 's really great ... Jeff . Oh , right . Sorry . I don 't think you 'd understand . I don 't understand anything that has transpired . ( BEEPING ) Green ? Still red . Now I don 't understand . We may have saved Ben Franklin 's mother , but we haven 't stopped the witch trials . There 's no telling how many innocent people are gonna die if this goes on . Too bad you could not bring back those who have already died . You know something , Abby , maybe we can . ( BELL RINGING ) Hear ye ! Hear ye ! Hear ye ! Hear ye ! The Honorable Justice Samuel Sewell hath declared that on this day , the 14 of November in the year of our Lord , 1692 a search of all homes and property shall take place . The object being to find the witch , Abiah Folger , and her agents of Satan . The good and right Reverends Noyes and Parris shall lead such search and conduct a meeting of the town upon its completion . Said meeting shall commence at 8 : 00 by the clock this evening . And end in good time . Hear ye ! Hear ye ! Hear ye ! Hear ye ! MAN : The Honorable Justice Samuel Sewell hath declared that on this day , the 14 of November in the year of our Lord , 1692 a search of all homes and property shall take place . The object being to find the witch ... Okay . ... and her agents of Satan . Are you certain we 're safe here ? Believe me . This is the last place on earth they 'd look . Where do you want these , Bogg ? Up by the altar . Relax . It 's all going to be over soon . That is not what bothers me . It is the glass . The glass ? Thou shalt not steal . Mr. Owen was planning to install these panes this very week . We 're only borrowing them . Trust me . Mr. Owens 's gonna have these back before he knows they 're missing . Where do you want them ? Line them up in the alcoves . We should be able to hide in there . BOGG : That 's it , kid . Right there . And these will create the illusion ? With enough candles and the right costumes . That 's the easy part . What then is difficult ? The performance . Getting Parris and Noyes and all those little girls to give up the witch hunts all depends on how well we play our parts . My very daughter says the devils were aided by yet another witch in this town . And that be the reason for not finding them . Be that true , young Betty ? And the witch , be it in this room now ? Where , Betty ? Name the witch ! Who desecrates this House of the Lord ? You , Reverend Noyes ! You are the one who desecrates this House of the Lord . That child knows no witches . Only in her imagination . Who are you , vision ? Goody Esty . The vision is Mary Esty killed this June past . I recognize her cloak . No . You be not Goody Esty . You be the devil , vision ! Would the devil make himself present in the House of the Lord , Reverend Parris ? This vision is the work of Abiah Folger and her devils . The witch has infected the very church . ( ALL SCREAMING ) BOGG : Silence children ! It is the imaginations of these children that have infected the church , Parris . Giles Cory . The farmer Cory . How much longer will you listen to their screaming voices instead of the voice of reason ? How many more innocent people will you allow to be murdered ? Innocent ? Cory , you gave no evidence . Was I given a chance , Reverend Noyes ? Or I ? What chance does an old woman stand against a pew of young girls ? Your ears were deaf to all but their screams . WOMAN : There are no witches in Salem . There never were . Suzanne Martin ? Tell them , Betty . Abigail . Did you have any real evidence against me ? On your souls , answer me . Betty ? Answer . On your souls . No . No ! ( CRYING ) NOYES : For all those we have hurt , all those we have killed , dear Lord , forgive us . Well , that about does it kid . Terrific . I gotta tell you , all this ghost and s√©ance stuff is really giving me the creeps . You aren 't alone . All I want to do is get those back to Mr. Owen and move on . I think you should change your costume first . Bogg , remember Josiah in Boston . Right . Can 't forget little Ben . I think you 're wonderful , Phineas . Must you go ? I 'm afraid so . And you 'll never tell me the secrets of your disappearance ? Or who you are ? It 's a sworn secret . Abby , there 's something I 'd like to know . Yes ? How 'd you do that lady ghost over there in the corner ? I thought you were in the alcove with me . I was in the alcove with you . JEFFREY ... If you wanna know more about the Salem witch trials or the great Houdini take a voyage down to your public library . It 's all in books ! ( MAN YELLING ) Lawrence of Arabia ? ( SCREAMS ) Save yourself , kid . Bogg ! You 've got to calm down . The Omni ! Where is it ? This is Thomas Edison . He probably invented the thing . You 've wrecked it ! Now I 'll never get back to Bogg ! Make room for our two new guests . And in the morning , you both die . BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! Warm it in your hands . What makes you think my hands are warm ? This is great . Just terrific . Stupid Omni brings us to the middle of Siberia , ( DINGS ) Green light all the way , and the stupid thing won 't take us out . What do you expect ? That thing 's at least 20,000 years overdue for servicing . So service it . If I had my guidebook , I would . But my guidebook is back ... With my mangy mutt in 1982 . Thank you . Now keep moving or you 're gonna freeze to death . Freeze to death ? Ten more minutes of this and I 'm gonna be a popsicle . Move ! ( GROANS ) You know , they found frozen mastodons here in Siberia . Yeah ? Those big hairy elephant things ? Yeah . They were perfectly preserved after 10,000 years . So ? So maybe we should let ourselves freeze . Thousands of years from now , somebody 'll find us , thaw us out ... ( LAUGHS ) Good idea . Did the mastodons come back to life ? On the other hand ... I think I got it . Hold on . ( DINGS ) Think warm thoughts . I 'm thinking . ( BEEPING ) Bat 's breath ! Come on , Omni , give us a little warm ... ( SNEEZES ) ( WIND WHISTLING ) ( EXPLOSION ) There , it worked . ( EXPLOSION ) Come on , kid . Under the wagon . Where are we ? I don 't know , kid . But you wanted it warm . You got it warm . Thanks . ( BEEPING ) 1917 . You got any idea what 's going on here ? JEFFREY : A major hassle . BOGG : Yeah , I figured that . Can you be a little more specific ? Those guys are Arabs , I think . What do you mean , you think ? Well , they 're dressed like Arabs . BOGG : What about the others ? JEFFREY : Well , they 're dressed like soldiers . This isn 't a fashion show . I need names , places . Well , ask that broken-down , Mickey Mouse watch of yours . I 'll deal with that smart mouth of yours later . At least we 're safe for now , under this wagon . ( EXPLOSION ) Let 's get out of here ! Come on ! Lawrence ? Lawrence ! It is Lawrence ! It is Lawrence ! Lawrence of Arabia ? Yes . Come on . We gotta help him . You stay where you are . But , Bogg , I wanna meet him . I 'll introduce you later . Bogg ! Bogg ! Help ! Bogg ! Help ! Jeff , get out of here ! JEFFREY : Bogg ! ( COUGHING ) Save yourself , kid . Bogg ! I can 't leave you ! Forget about me ! Hit it ! Hit it ! Get out of here ! Go on . Come on , Omni , work ! ( CHURCH BELLS RINGING ) Mary ! Lunchtime ! Come on , children . And don 't dawdle , Marion . Your father 's coming home for lunch . Any luck this morning ? Huh ? I said , did you have any luck this morning ? Confounded glass won 't hold a vacuum . What 's for lunch ? Well , I made sandwiches out of last night 's ... ( WIND WHISTLING ) Do you hear something ? Last night 's what ? Not that awful meatloaf again ? JEFFREY : Bogg ! That 's a voice ! Where you going ? Thomas , it 's a boy ! Oh ! Oh , boy . Oh , dear . Where did he come from ? He smells like a bonfire . ( COUGHING ) Maybe he 's inhaled too much smoke . The only thing smoking around here is this cigar . Poor thing . Let 's put him up on the porch . He looks just awful . Probably ate some of your meatloaf . I wonder who he belongs to ? I don 't know . I 'll ask the boys at the shop . Maybe they 'll know . Well , we 'll just keep him here until we find out . Poor dear . I wonder what could be so important . Thomas , what do you make of this ? ( BEEPING ) I 'll take it to the shop . Thomas , it 's the boy 's property . I won 't hurt a thing . You bring that back here right now ! What ? Thomas Alva Edison , you are an impossible man ! Can 't hear you . MAN : This is the day of celebration . Yesterday , your Arab tribesmen made a feeble attempt to take this city of Aqaba . The attempt was not only a defeat for them , but a more personal misfortune for your leader . So prisoners , you have a new companion . ( CROWD CHEERING ) Here he is . Here is your blue-eyed hero of your Arab army . This is the Englishman who says that you desert tribesmen can defeat the Turks . We must talk to him . There is no time for talk . We must help him . We cannot . Not yet . Welcome , Lawrence . To the prison at Aqaba . You may have failed your friends , but you have rewarded your enemies . The commandant became a rich man today . There was a tidy price on Lawrence 's head . Lawrence , I will leave you here among your people , so they may pay homage to their hero . Regrettably , not long . The Englishman has a long-standing appointment with a Turkish firing squad . Tomorrow morning , the eighth hour , you die . ( CHURCH BELL RINGING ) Well , hello , there , young man . How do you feel ? Where ... What happened ? ( CHUCKLING ) That 's what I 'd like to know . We found you out on the front yard . Bogg ! Really , you 've got to rest . You 've got to calm down . No . I 've gotta get back to him . Is Bogg your father ? The Omni ! Where is it ? Have you seen a metal thing ? It 's just about this big ? Looks like a watch ? Yes , ma 'am . Where is it ? I 've gotta get back to Bogg . Well , my husband has it right now . Do you know where he is ? Yes , he 's across the street at the shop . Thanks ! I really don 't think you should ... Edison . MAN : Hey , does anybody know what gauge wire he wants ? It 's not in the specs . Sixteen-gauge copper . And he wants the solders perfect . Is there any other way ? MAN : Pull this off the burner , will you ? Excuse me . Kruesi , I blow eight in two hours . Tell him if he does not find a vacuum in these , I quit . You tell him . Are you crazy ? That way I could lose my job . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) You 're the kid that owns that watch device . How did you know ? Mrs. E. Just called up from the house . Come on . John Kruesi . Jeffrey Jones . Yeah , the old man seemed real interested in that thing . Where did you get it ? A friend . Hope he was a good one . What do you want ? JEFFREY : The Omni . Well , kid , welcome to Menlo Park . You 've wrecked it ! It 's totaled ! Now I 'll never get back to him ! What ? You stupid idiot ! Now I 'll never get back to Bogg ! Hey , kid , easy . It 's all right , Kruesi . Let him yell . Don 't touch those parts ! Move one out of place and I 'll never be able to put it back together again . You can get it back ? Kid , this is Thomas Edison . He probably invented the thing . Not quite , Kruesi . Darn thing 's got me stumped . You know what it had ? A light . This thing had a red light . And it blinked on and off . It 's got a green one , too . How ? A good electric light hasn 't even been invented yet , and this thing has got one in miniature . This fellow , Bogg ... He an inventor ? No , not really . Not really , huh ? I can 't find a power source . I can 't find a lamp . I can 't find any good reason why this watch can produce light . And yet it does . Has he had it patented yet ? I don 't think so . Good . Good . Boss . What is it , Upton ? Mr. Lowrey is here . He 's got the big fellow with him . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Don 't touch those parts . Don 't worry , kid . He 'll put it back . Just right now he 's got bigger things on his mind . How close is it ? If they dig all day , maybe we can break through by sundown . They 're going to kill Lawrence in the morning . Yes . Must be tonight . Lawrence , are you hurt ? Stuck here in this humiliating pose , my ego is rather bruised . But apart from that , no other injuries . Thank you , sir . Thank you for your valiant effort to save me . What happened ? You were supposed to win here at Aqaba . The attack is still 48 hours away . Ours was only an advance troop sent to find any weak spots in the Turks ' defense . And ? And we were found out in the marketplace when one of my Arab comrades was thrown from his horse . His temper got the best of him , and he started shouting at the beast , in Arabic . Can 't the army be pulled back together somehow ? Well , I pray so . For as long as the Turks control Aqaba , they can take good aim at any ship in the Suez Canal and that makes them very good allies for the Germans . I could reunite them again , but not from inside this prison . And not from inside the grave that the Turks have sworn to bury me in . Quiet . I think he 's a friend to Lawrence . Or perhaps a friend to the commandant . We can 't trust anyone , Oman . Even Lawrence will have to wait . Now go . You 're not going to end up in any grave . Your friend , Jeffrey . Has he gotten away , then ? I hope so . I hope so . Wait , please . What do you want ? I 've watched you . You and your friend have been dropping dirt down the well . You 're mistaken . Are you working on a way out of here ? No . I 'm not going to tell anybody . If I had three wishes , she 'd be one of them . ( GRUNTING ) Bucketful of mud . Give it a few minutes to settle . Has the well gone bad ? No . Good well . It 's running fresh water for many years . Where 's the dirt coming from ? The tunnels . Escape tunnels ? Yes . Then there is a tunnel . I knew it . I saw some prisoners dropping dirt in the well . ( CHUCKLES ) Over the years I 've seen tons of dirt being dropped into that well . I 've dumped my share in over the years . You 're digging a tunnel ? Everybody 's digging a tunnel . Everybody ? Yes . The commandant has to find out sooner or later . He knows . He knows ? Yes . And he allows the digging to go on ? Prisoners are kept busy . The water table is high . The commandant knows he needn 't worry about escapes out of this place . Then there 's no way out . For you ? For Lawrence . Ah . There is one way . ( LAUGHING ) Oh , yes . When the commandant and his firing squad are finished , Lawrence will be free . Great . ( MUEZZIN CALLING ) EDISON : Now , the last lamp you saw had a platinum filament . And , as I recall , it burned for less than a minute . Yes , but we 're using lampblack now . Pure rolled carbon . Lampblack . That 's an interesting approach . Doesn 't look like they 're having much success with that either . All right . Close up the shades . The man without the moustache is Grosvenor Lowrey , one of the biggest backers of the Edison Light Company . Who 's the other guy ? The biggest backer . J.P. Morgan . Right . Upton , are you ready ? We 're ready , boss . Okay . Fire it up . Just a little bit at a time . You know , I don 't think this is the way it happened . What ? Forget it . Okay , a little more . More ! Okay ! EDISON : Good ! Now , I know it doesn 't look like much , but I think we 're on the right track . If you could just give us ... One week , one month , one year ? I think you could have all the time in the world , Mr. Edison , and you still couldn 't come up with a light that works . No , thank you . I 'm pulling me and my bank out of this mess . Good day . J. P ! Well , so much for the electric light . There goes our backing . But they can 't back out now . Edison 's gonna make it work . Not without Morgan 's money . Lowrey , talk to him . I can 't talk to Morgan when he 's got his mind made up . I 'm sorry , Tom . MORGAN : Coming , Lowrey ? LOWREY : Right there , J.P. Mr. Morgan ! Yes , son ? I haven 't got much time . You haven 't got much sense , either . What ? Please , son . Thomas Edison is the greatest inventor alive . The phonograph , the repeating telegraph . He even made the telephone work better . That is not what 's at issue . Look , you wanna make some money , right ? That 's the general idea , yes . Well , then what other inventor would you rather invest your money in ? Thomas Edison 's got a track record that just won 't quit . Track record . Interesting expression . You miss out on the electric light , and you 're gonna miss out on an invention that 's going to change the face of this world . It 's a gold mine here . You 're looking at a fortune . All right , all right . I give in . Thank God ! On two conditions . The first is that you , young man , come to see me when you 're an adult . I could use a man with your persuasion . Second is that I see some positive results in 48 hours . Otherwise , Tom , we 're back where we started . Good day . Forty-eight hours . Is he crazy ? Well , kid , it was a nice try . Forty-eight hours . Heck , I invented the phonograph in less than a day . Let 's go to work ! All right ! Is this the last of it ? The tunnel is finished . Then we will be ready in time . We can free Lawrence tonight . Good luck to us all . Fire ! Fire ! MAN 1 : Get buckets ! ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) MAN 2 : Get the buckets ! Get the buckets ! I need men over here ! Bring water from the well ! MAN : Come on ! Come on ! What 's going on ? I 'm getting you out of here . Well , then , you 're responsible for all this excitement . You got it ! Are you sure you 're not British ? This way . Fools . I need more men ! BOGG : Hurry . The horses are down here . Lawrence has escaped ! MAN : Call the commandant ! Lawrence has escaped ! Hurry ! Lawrence . Did you really think it was going to be so easy ? ( LAUGHING ) Clear a cell block . Make room for our two new guests . You 'll be less trouble if you 're locked up overnight . And in the morning , you both die . How 's it going , Kruesi ? This batch is ready to roll . Huh ? This batch is ready to roll ! Good ! Are you sure this is right ? I don 't even know what I 'm doing . What you 're doing is scraping pure carbon from these lamps into little piles . Exactly . What has that got to do with the electric light ? What I 'm doing is rolling the carbon into their filaments , which go into the lamps . Which light up when you put electricity through them . Got it . Problem is , it hasn 't been working . It 'd work , all right , if you could roll the darn things thinner ! Look at that filament , Kruesi . It 's a disaster . EDISON : Let the kid do it . He 's got smaller hands . Boehm ? Where 's Boehm ? Has he got those light bulbs ready yet ? We 've only got 36 hours ! Well , kid . The future of the Edison light is in your hands . ( MUEZZIN CALLING ) Well , it 's dawn . I 've gotta get you out of here . Down here , locked up , unarmed ? I have a cache of weapons stored just outside the gate , but they might just as well be in Buckingham Palace for all the good they 'll do us . So , we don 't have weapons . And we 're locked up down here . Outnumbered . We 'll think of something . Your optimism is appreciated , but I 'm afraid this is the end for me . I think I shall miss the desert more than anything else . Nearly all Europeans think of the desert as nothing , as an arid void . But I , I know it as a thing of rapture and beauty . It 's taken over my senses . Just as its people have taken over my heart . EDISON : That 's it ! Forget it ! You did your best , kid . We 'll make another one . One that 's better ! It 's a waste of time , son . Let 's just call it a day . No , you can 't . We still have four hours . Look , you could roll lampblack for four more years and it wouldn 't make a difference . It 's the wrong material , son . Back to square one . No . You got to invent the light . You got to . I will ! I will ! Just not today . What is it , the 20th ? The 21st ? ( SIGHING ) On this day , October 21 , 1879 , I am gonna take a good long nap , put the electric lamp away for a rest , and tell J.P. Morgan what he can do with his money . ( LAUGHING ) What do you think of that , son ? No ! Don 't you see ? You 're gonna mess everything up ! You still upset about this watch ? I can put it together in no time . No ! Get out there ! Make the light ! Do it ! ( CRYING ) If Bogg was here ... I messed up everything . Everything ! It 's been a long haul , son . Maybe I have pushed too hard . ( SNIFFLING ) Come on over here . I 'll sew that sleeve up for you . I think I 've got a needle and thread here somewhere . Come on . Come on over here . Mr. Edison ? Mr. Edison ? You put it in a kiln until it 's carbon . What ? The thread . It 's a perfect filament ! Upton ! Kruesi ! Quick ! Fire up the kiln ! I got it ! I got it ! EDISON : All right , Upton . Let 's give it a try . Yeah . More . More . An inch more . That 's it . That 's it ! ( ALL CHEERING ) That 's it ! Hey . Come on , you little teary-eyed monster . There 's nothing to cry about . We did it ! We did it ! I hope it works okay . You 're lucky if it works at all . This thing had the dirtiest movement I 've ever seen . What did you do to get it that way ? I don 't think you 'd believe me . ( GRUNTS ) I think that 's it . ( OMNI DINGS ) No leftover pieces . A green light now . Beautiful . I still can 't understand how it works or why it 's so tiny . It 's some kind of toy . What 's it supposed to be ? A time-travel machine . Time-travel ? ( LAUGHS ) Now that 'd be an invention . It 's a beautiful day for an execution . Plenty of light . No excuses for any of you to miss your mark . ( KEYS RATTLING ) Here 's your breakfast . I watched you escape last night . Congratulations . Would your escape have been any more successful ? We must be desperate . She 's a kitchen maid . She 's much more . She 's been secretly dumping freshly dug soil into the well out there . Is that true ? Yes . Then you do have a way out of here . I did . What do you mean ? The commandant has cleared the entire cell block for your security . So ? For months , friends of mine had been kept in the next cell . Well , then your friends should be grateful for whatever freedom our capture has afforded them . Your capture has cheated them of their freedom . LAWRENCE : How is that ? The tunnel . It 's down here . In the next cell . Girl , why didn 't you tell us this before ? Because I was going to show you . My friends and I were about to free you when he decided to rescue you . It wouldn 't have happened if you 'd been more honest with me . I couldn 't trust you with that knowledge . Then why should we trust you now ? Because she could be on her way out of here right now . I am not a martyr . All we 'd have to do is wait until you have both been executed and things return to normal . Right in the next cell . Might as well be in Buckingham Palace . Where 's the tunnel lead ? Into catacombs that run beneath the prison and out into the city . We must get to that tunnel . You cannot go alone . It is like a maze down there . You would get lost . Gentlemen . I hope you enjoyed breakfast . It was your last meal . It 's time . Your firing squad waits . Gentlemen . Even though we didn 't get out , it was a bloody good effort , Phineas . BOGG : Yeah , " A " for effort . Don 't blame yourself . The fire was a good diversion . Not good enough . No escape attempt would be good enough , gentlemen . There is no way in or out of this prison that I don 't know about . ( WIND WHISTLING ) COMMANDANT : Get them ! Stop them ! Great entrance , kid . What 's going on ? MEDINA : Follow me . This way . Get them ! Get him ! Up , you fool ! The catacombs are just beneath this tunnel . Up ! Up , idiots ! Get up ! Never mind about me . Get after them . Go ! MEDINA : Around this corner . ( RATS SQUEAKING ) BOGG : I was wondering when you 'd get back here . JEFFREY : I came just as soon as I could . You 'd never guess what happened . Later . Awful dark down here . There 's nothing to be afraid of . ( SCREAMS ) This is where we used to bury our dead . This way . LAWRENCE : Dark down here . I hear them behind us ! BOGG : All ahead . I got an idea . Thanks . Oh , wow ! Good work , old boy . Is it much further ? No . The exit is this way . Down here ! Somebody ! Help , somebody ! Quickly ! Come ! There . BOGG : Oh , no . We 'll dig it out . Hurry ! They made it through to the catacombs . After them ! Go ! Come on , everybody , start digging . COMMANDANT : Wait . Wait . Wait . ( SHUSHING ) This way . COMMANDANT : There 's no way out of here . They can 't escape . JEFFREY : Bogg ! I know , kid . I hear it , too . Keep digging . COMMANDANT : Up here . To the right . Bogg , Medina 's gone . MEDINA : Lawrence , hurry ! Bogg , they found us ! COMMANDANT : After her ! This way ! Get her ! We got to help her . No ! She knew there was only one way out . She 's a courageous woman . Bogg , the Omni 's still red . ( BEEPING ) We gotta get Lawrence out . Where are they ? The others ? Gone . Stupid little sewer rat . You 'll sacrifice yourself ? Who helped to dig that tunnel ? Show me the way out of the catacombs . How did Lawrence escape ? Lawrence has escaped . Lawrence has escaped ! ( CROWD CHATTERING ) Lawrence ! Lawrence ! PRISONERS : ( CHANTING ) Lawrence ! Lawrence ! Lawrence ! Lawrence ! Lawrence ! Listen . ( PRISONERS CHANTING ) We can 't leave Medina behind . We can 't take on the commandant and all his men . Phineas is rather like me . He doesn 't give much thought to odds . You said there were weapons stashed out here . Yes , guns , ammunition and some explosives . Come on . PRISONERS : Lawrence ! Lawrence ! Make them stop . Tell them to stop ! I could not even if I tried . Keep your secrets . Take them with you to the grave ! Lawrence ! Lawrence ! Never mind the girl . Get him ! Go ! You 're not going to escape . Medina ! Get me out ! JEFFREY : Bogg ! Bogg ! Bogg ! Hey , don 't worry , kid . I 'm not going anywhere without you . I promise . MAN : Lawrence ! Thank you , Phineas , my friend . My dear friends . Thank you . PRISONERS : ( CHANTING ) Lawrence ! Lawrence ! ( DINGS ) I hope he makes it . He will . Thanks to you . BOGG : Menlo Park , December 31st , 1879 . It may be Menlo Park , but it feels like Siberia . Quit complaining , will you ? It was your idea to come here . ( OMNI DINGS ) I can 't believe this . This thing is working like brand new . All right , folks ! It 's ready ! There 's the guy who gave it the overhaul . Has anybody seen Mr. Dooley ? He 's lit this street for the last 40 years . He 's going to light it tonight . Where you going ? Inside with Edison . I want to thank him in person . I already did . Beside , you don 't want to be inside now . Why not ? We 'll miss the whole thing ! What whole thing ? ( CROWD CHEERING ) ( CROWD APPLAUDING ) This the first time ? The very first . Isn 't it beautiful ? Yeah , kid . It 's beautiful . JEFFREY ... If you want to know more about Thomas Edison or Lawrence of Arabia , take a voyage down to your public library . It 's all in books ! Done by ( c ) dcd / January 2008

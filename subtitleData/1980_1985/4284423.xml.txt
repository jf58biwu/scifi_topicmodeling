 MAN : Get Cleopatra ! Those barbarians want me dead . Can 't this car go any faster ? I lost her . You lost Cleopatra in New York City ? ( ALL CHEERING ) Babe Ruth 's the greatest player baseball ever knew . Maybe I 'm finished . Just keep him busy tonight . He 's already inside . Why would Lucky Luciano want to kidnap Babe Ruth ? ( CHATTERING ) Hey , Mr. Ruth , you wasn 't gonna leave without saying good night , was you ? BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! MAN : Caesar 's been killed ! He was assassinated on the Senate floor . Find me Caesar 's woman so she can share his fate . A gold coin to the man who finds her . ( PLUMMETING ) Search for her ! It 's better than a haystack . Yeah . BOGG : Wow . Bogg , the Omni . ( BEEPING ) Roll . You won 't take me without a fight . Bogg , look out ! Get away ! Get away from me . I will not be led away calmly like some sheep to slaughter ! Look , lady , we 're not here to hurt you . He 's telling you the truth . I can 't trust anyone . They 've killed Julius . Julius Caesar ? Yes . Bat 's breath ! We 're too late . Wait , what 's the date ? ( BEEPING ) 44 B.C. Is it the Ides of March ? Yes . Oh , Julius loved holidays . He got to ride in his chariot and make speeches to the senators . Bogg , Julius Caesar died in 44 B.C. On the Ides of March . He was murdered on the Senate floor . You sure ? Yeah , I 'm sure . ( BEEPING ) Then why 's the Omni red ? MAN : Get Cleopatra ! Kill the Egyptian princess ! Those barbarians want me dead . Cleopatra ? Yes ? The Cleopatra ? There couldn 't be more than one , kid . Not with a face that beautiful . Well , then , that 's it , Bogg ! Cleopatra didn 't die with Caesar . She escaped from Rome and went to Egypt . ( CHATTERING ) I loathe Egypt . It 's hot and it 's dusty . MAN : Kill the Egyptian princess ! But I have always loved sailing on the Nile . BOGG : Good . Here , put this on . But this is a slave 's robe . I wouldn 't be caught dead wearing this . You may be dead if you don 't . Come on . ( BANGING ) MAN : Cleopatra ! We know you 're in there . BRUTUS : It 'll be easier if you surrender . Kid , get ready . Oh , Brutus ! I 'm out here . There ! Get them ! Come on , kid , let 's go . Go on , kid . Don 't let them get away ! Please , not Julius ! ( GROANS ) Help me ! MAN : She 's in there ! Come on . What do we do ? There . CLEOPATRA : There what ? BOGG : Go on . I 'm not going to jump . Oh , yes , you are ! ( SCREAMS ) Help me ! Now . No ! MAN : Get her ! After them ! She 's gotten away ! Search the city , scour the countryside . She mustn 't escape ! BOGG : Okay , kid , let 's go . This is hardly the style in which I 'm accustomed to traveling . We just saved your life . A simple " thank you " would be nice . You expect gratitude ? To most men , it would be considered a privilege to protect my life . Well , I guess we 're not like most men . Come on , Jeff . You 're not leaving me here in the middle of nowhere ? You 're safe . The coast is just beyond the hill . As the queen of Egypt , I command you to stay . Sorry , I 'm a citizen of the world , free to come and go as I choose . Please . Please , don 't leave me . Much as I 'd like to stay , duty calls . Have you never heard of Queen Cleopatra ? It is said that I have cast magical spells of love over men stronger than even you . Yeah , I 've heard . And I always hoped that I 'd bump into you someday . Bogg . But I really gotta go . Oh , boy . Come on , let 's wrap this up . Bogg ? Bogg ! ( PLUMMETING ) What a kiss ! ( BEEPING ) All men promise their kiss will cause the Earth to tremble , but ... I thought we 'd drop in to say hi . ... your kiss , it really made the Earth move . It 's not my kiss . Then what caused this magic ? We gotta get out of here . Come on . It 's a wonderful chariot . Yeah . Where are we ? CLEOPATRA : What is this wonderful place ? BOGG : It 's not Rome , 44 B.C. I can see that ! Get going back . Atlantis . This must be the lost continent of Atlantis ! ( HORN TOOTING ) Such big chariots . How did we travel here ? It was a mistake . You 're not supposed to be here . I was born to the throne of Egypt . Certainly a place so rich and exotic as this is exactly where I belong . Good afternoon , honey . You belong back on your throne in Egypt . I 'd rather be queen of this magnificent land . ( WHISTLING ) There 's nothing for me back there . Jeffrey is back there . Then you go back and get him . I 'm taking you with me . Now , what 's the harm in my looking around this great , glorious land ? I 'm in no danger here . MAN : Lucky Lindy 's landed ! ( ALL CHEERING ) ( CLAMORING ) Cleopatra ? I can 't believe he made it ! Bat 's breath . Hey . Bogg ! What took you so long ? I had a little problem . Where 's Cleopatra ? I lost her . You what ? I lost her . What year ? You ever hear of Lucky Lindy ? Charles Lindberg ? Yeah . Well , he just landed in France . 1927 . ( BEEPING ) Where ? I think I see something . There , in the trees ! You lost Cleopatra in New York City ? Maybe I should 've stayed there and looked for her instead of coming back for you , huh ? No , Bogg , you did the right thing . You there ! Stop in the name of the Roman Empire . Look for them . They 're gone . Where could they go ? Bogg , I lived here all my life , and believe me , it 's a big city . Don 't worry . We 'll find her . Where do we look first ? You 're the one from New York . Yeah , New York , 1982 , not 1927 . She 's probably trying to find us by now . Get serious . She hasn 't got a penny . She 'd be easy to spot , with that beautiful long black hair . And she 's running around town in that silly-Iooking outfit . In fact , she 's probably cold , hungry and alone . Hey , you alone , toots ? Toots ? I hope you forgive me for being so forward , huh ? But you are one good-Iooking doll . You 're forgiven , Mr ... Luciano . I know every beautiful girl in this city . How come we never met before , huh ? Well , actually , I just arrived . Oh , you 're new in town , huh , toots ? So , where you from ? Most recently , Rome . Hey , I 'm from Sicily . ( SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) JEFFREY : Bogg , we 've been searching for hours . We 're never gonna find her . Well , we can 't give up now . ( BELL RINGS ) Hey , Bogg , Yankee Stadium 's just up here . Come on . Yeah ? What 's a Yankee Stadium ? It 's like the Colosseum . You think she might be there ? You ever had a hot dog before , Bogg ? I used to have them all the time with the works . Relish , mustard ... Bogg , this is all wrong ! What else could be wrong ? It 's gotta be around here somewhere . What are you talking about ? The stadium , Yankee Stadium . Maybe we 're on the wrong street . No , it should be right over there . They probably moved it . Bogg , you can 't just move something that big . I lost a woman . You lost a whole building . Oh , come on , Jeff , we 're supposed to be looking for Cleopatra , not a stadium . " Yankees still in cellar . Lose six-to-one at Polo . " That 'll be a nickel , kid . Mister , do the Yankees still play at the Polo Grounds ? Only when they ain 't playing at Carnegie Hall . What about Yankee Stadium ? The Yankees gotta start winning some games before anybody builds them their own stadium . Why aren 't they winning ? What about Murderers ' Row ? What about Ruth ? Ruth ? Ruth who ? Babe Ruth . Nobody named Ruth ever played for the New York Yankees . JEFFREY : His real name was George Herman Ruth , but everybody called him Babe . Babe Ruth . Oh , I think I saw him pitch once , in 1922 , when the Red Sox were in town . Babe Ruth was still pitching in 1922 ? Yeah . And he 's not with the Yankees ? Kid , I already told you . Never was . He retired a couple of years ago . I think he went into vaudeville , and then just sort of disappeared . Thanks . Come on . The Omni . Is it still red ? ( BEEPING ) Well , yeah . What do you expect with Cleopatra running around loose ? No ! It 's not her . It 's Babe Ruth . Now we 've got to go to the Red Sox 1919 spring training . Hey , look , kid , we got Cleopatra 2,000 years out of time . I think that 's a little bit more important . Yankee Stadium is called " the house that Ruth built . " Without him , it never would 've existed . We 're not exactly talking about the pyramids or the Great Wall of China . Bogg , baseball just wouldn 't be baseball without Babe Ruth . Jeffrey , no . You know , Bogg , as a Yankee , Babe Ruth did some pretty wonderful things for people . It 's just not important enough . Once there was this really sick kid . So sick , in fact , that he couldn 't even get out of bed to go to the ballpark . Quit the hearts and flowers , will you ? Babe Ruth visited this kid at the hospital . He promised to hit a home run just for him . Yeah ? Yeah . And if we don 't get Babe Ruth back on the right track , the kid 'll never meet Babe . What 's a hot dog ? ( PLUMMETING ) Jeffrey ? I 'm okay , Bogg . Nothing broken . Except this darn Omni . The Omni 's broken ? ( BEEPING ) The gear 's stuck in the automatic mode . Oh . Days like this I wish voyagers had gone union . We don 't get overtime pay , paid vacations ... 1669 , England . Flashing red . I wonder what 's wrong . Oh , blast ! Oh ... ( EXCLAIMING ) Here you go . Oh , I 'm most grateful . Newton . Bogg , this is Jeffrey . Beautiful day like this must be perfect inspiration for a writer . Well , I 'm not actually a writer . I 'm a professor here at Cambridge . My father was a teacher there . Oh , yes , and a very good one , I 'm sure . However , lately , I 've been feeling more like a student myself . I 've been working on a problem for weeks . A hypothesis on gravity . ( CHUCKLING ) Oh , it 's far too nice a day to worry about any of my dubious theories . Thank you . Good day . Bogg , that was Newton . Sir Isaac Newton . " Sir " Newton ? Well , he hasn 't been knighted yet . And he never will be out there . We have to get him there , under that apple tree . BOGG : Why ? JEFFREY : Gravity . Mr. Newton . Are you all right ? I beg your pardon ? Sunburn . Sunstroke . But it 's been cloudy all day . That 's worse . Much worse . How long have you been out here ? Well , when I 'm working , I lose complete track of time . But , perhaps you 're right . Maybe I should pack up and go home . BOGG : Well ... ( BOGG CHUCKLING ) I don 't know if that 's really necessary . No sense stopping your work . Sit under this beautiful , shady tree . Why , thank you . ( BEEPING ) Yes , yes , this is much more comfortable . Ouch ! Blasted apple ! Hit me straight on the head . Dropped off the tree and fell on my head as if some force propelled it back towards the earth . Thank you , gentlemen . Our pleasure . Now we can get back to New York . After we go to the Red Sox 's 1919 spring training . No . We 're going back to New York City , 1927 . But , Bogg , you promised . I know , I 'm sorry , but I changed my mind . Voyagers ' prerogative . Bogg , what about baseball ? What about the kid in the hospital ? You caught me at a weak moment , all right ? All the sob stories in the world aren 't gonna change the fact that we 're still talking about baseball . But ... Jeffrey , it 's only a game . That 's it ! The apple was pulled by the Earth 's gravity . That 's it . Bogg , it 's only an apple . Come on , slap them . Make them work . Make them work . Let 's go . Go down there and get some sweat popping on those guys , will you ? Well , good morning , Mr. Ruth . I 'm so pleased that you could join us . You 're late ! Well , I 'm sorry , Mr. Barrow . But I don 't need a curfew , and you know that . I mean , I 'm out all night and here I am , sharp as a tack . As manager of this team it 's my job to enforce the rules . So , you miss one more bed check and you 're gonna find yourself on the bench . No , you can 't afford that and you know it . I 'm the best pitcher you got ! Yeah , well , one more word , you 're gonna be doing your pitching in batting practice . Why don 't you listen to me , Barrow ? You got better pitchers , why don 't you play them ? BOGG : I 'm better . Are you talking to me ? Yes , sir . So you 're better than the Babe , huh ? That 's right . Yeah , well , that 's one man 's opinion , yours . Why don 't you let him try out ? Then you can decide . Yeah , you 're a big , strong-Iooking fellow . Where 'd you play last ? The bush leagues in Texas . They play some pretty wild and wooly ball down there . What have I got to lose ? Okay , rookie , you got your shot . Suit up . I hope you know what you 're doing , or we 're both gonna look like a couple of fools . Trust me , Bogg . Just trust me . I 'll never pitch as good as Babe . You gotta pitch better than Babe . As long as Babe 's a pitcher , he 'll never hit 60 home runs . JEFFREY : I 'm teaching you how to throw sliders , screwballs and knucklers . All these pitches haven 't even been invented yet . Nobody around here 's ever seen anything like them before . That 's it . You 're tougher to please than Abner Doubleday . You were there when Abner Doubleday invented baseball ? Well , I knew him as Captain Doubleday at Fort Sumter . We tossed the ball around a little bit between battles . He thought my pitching was pretty good . Give me a break . Okay , kid , let 's see what you got . Hank ! Give me a couple of hitters in there . Good ones . MAN 1 : Macready ? Got you . MAN 2 : Okay , kid , show us what you got . ( MAN CHATTERING ) I don 't know what it is , but he 's sure moving it around . He has a crazy style , doesn 't he ? Yeah , but there 's no arguing with a guy that throws every pitch over for a strike . Your friend , he 's pretty good , kid . Yeah . Yes , Mr. Ruth . BABE : He throws a lot of trick pitches . And the way his leg comes up , I figured for a second there he 's gonna start tap dancing or something . But he sure makes that ball dance before it goes across the plate , though , don 't he ? I 've never seen a man throw a ball like that before . Boy , he 's a darn good pitcher . Pitching 's not everything . It is to a pitcher , kid . Well , Babe , what do you think ? Any fool can see he 's good . Good ? He 's great ! Now that I got a new ace , you 're not gonna be able to be a bad boy no more . Let 's not get into that again . You miss one bed check and I bench you . You miss two curfews and I suspend you . Will you stop yelling ? I suspend you without pay ! You 're gonna start living by the same rules as the rest of the team . You got it ? I got it ! Yeah , I got it . Maybe the rest of the team would be better off without me altogether . Suit yourself . Hey , kid . You 're really something . Hey , Barrow ! Where have you been hiding this dynamo ? MAN : Where 'd you find him ? Yeah , what 's his name ? What 's your name , kid ? Bogg . Phineas Bogg . Men , here 's your big story of the day . ( CAMERA CLICKING ) Gentlemen of the press , I want you to meet the new Red Sox pitching sensation , Phineas Bogg . ( MEN CHEERING ) Gee , I never seen anything like that . Boy , are you terrific ! You 're the greatest I 've ever seen ! You know , without your coaching , there 's no way I could 've thrown those pitches . Abner never would 've believed a ball could move like that . You ought to be real proud of yourself . Yeah . JEFFREY : I didn 't know he was gonna take it so hard . He wasn 't supposed to quit the game . Guess that 's why the Omni is red , huh ? So we got to do a little bit more . Like what ? You know how to hit those pitches you taught me ? Sure . I was cleanup man on my Little League team . How about teaching the Babe ? Mr. Ruth . Yeah , kid . Aren 't you gonna eat your lunch ? No . Kind of lost my appetite . And that ain 't no everyday occurrence , either . Did Mr. Barrow kick you off the team ? Not yet . But it 's only a matter of time , I figure . He only put up with my shenanigans because he didn 't have somebody better , and now with your friend , he 's definitely got somebody better . I figure the gentlemanly thing to do is probably quit before Barrow has to fire me . What do you think ? Isn 't baseball more important than staying up late ? Baseball 's probably more important to me than anything , except maybe the respect of my teammates . Did you see them when Barrow ripped into me , how they were laughing ? You see , those guys used to look up to me before . I just don 't know if I can play on a team when everybody 's feeling sorry for me . Maybe I 'm finished . Finished ? Babe Ruth 's the greatest player baseball ever knew . Come on , kid . You 're a hero to millions of kids . Yeah , I 'm not the hero now . Your friend is . And I taught him everything he knows . And you did good , too . I mean , he went through that whole lineup and nobody even got a bat on a ball . What if you could hit those pitches ? ( SCOFFING ) Come on . In fact , what if you could hit those pitches out of the park ? If I could hit like that ... If I could hit like that , I 'd give up pitching tomorrow . Take a breather , kid ! You 're going great . How 's it going with the Babe ? You 'll see . Think he can hit off me ? I taught him everything he knows . Well , don 't worry . I 'll take it easy on him . Well , Babe , I thought you 'd quit the team . No , Barrow , you can call me a lot of things , but a quitter ain 't one of them . Hotshot . How about trying to get some of those trick pitches by me , huh ? All right . Come on , Babe , rip it . MAN 1 : Hit the sky , Babe ! ( MEN CHATTERING ) Holy cow , look at that ball sail ! MAN 2 : Attaboy , Babe . Show this rookie . Nobody 's ever gotten near that pitch before . MAN 3 : Hit it , Babe . ( ALL EXCLAIMING ) I knew he could do it . I can 't get over it . The more he swings , the further he hits them . I could use him in the lineup everyday . Too bad he 's a pitcher . Yeah , you can 't use a pitcher everyday . If he wasn 't a pitcher , he could play in the outfield . Yeah , then he could play every day . Okay , Bogg , I 've seen enough ! We knew you could hit , Babe , but you killed those balls . Babe , how 'd you figure out that new kid 's pitches ? ( CLAMORING ) That was great , Bogg , the way you took it easy on him . Yeah , well , you know , the idea was to make him look good , so ... Yeah , well , thanks to you , he 's gonna be the greatest hitter in baseball . Now , can we get back to New York to find Cleopatra ? We gotta stick around . Hang on , kid . We 're on our way to New York . ( CLAMORING ) Terrific idea . How 'd you like to play everyday ? ( ALL CHEERING ) JEFFREY : There it is . Isn 't it something ? Yeah . What 's wrong ? Nothing . Come on , Jeff . You can tell me . ( SOBBING ) Last time I was here was with my dad . He used to take me to ball games all the time . We 'd sit right behind the Yankee dugout . One time he caught a foul ball and got the whole team to autograph it for me . ( WEEPING ) Your dad sounds like a pretty good guy . The greatest . ( SNIFFLING ) I don 't want anybody to see me cry . They 'll think I 'm a sissy . Why would they think that ? 'Cause men aren 't supposed to cry . Says who ? What about Napoleon at Waterloo ? George Washington at Valley Forge . General Eisenhower at Bunker Hill . ( LAUGHING ) You okay now ? Yeah . Come on . Come on , let 's go . Hey , you know who Babe Ruth is ? Are you kidding ? Come on , kid . Who hasn 't heard of the Babe ? Greatest hitter the game has ever known . Keep it . You guys look like a couple of real fans . For the wrong team , but that 's okay . Yeah , thanks . Thanks a lot . Now we search this city till we find Cleopatra . Yeah , and where do we look first ? I don 't know . " Coolidge chooses not to run for reelection . " Florenz Ziegfeld 's new show opens to rave reviews . " We found her . Where ? Yeah , that looks like her all right , but I 'm not sure . Her hair 's a lot shorter . No , it 's her all right . Look at the bracelet . Yeah , the snake bracelet . Who 's the guy ? " Patrons of Lucky Luciano 's club " couldn 't keep their eyes off the mystery vamp on Luciano 's arm . " Now we know why they call him Lucky . " Jeff , it 's Cleo ! Lucky , can I trust the rest of your accomplices ? It 's almost closing time . The only people left inside are a few loyal patrons and a couple of my trusted colleagues . Come on . The less witnesses , the better , I suppose . Yeah , look , we 're late already . Come on . No , wait . If I 'm to be involved in a kidnapping ... ( SHUSHES ) A kidnapping , I think I should know every detail of the plot . Come on , toots , don 't worry your pretty little head with details , huh ? He 's already inside . All you got to do is keep him busy tonight , all night . Come on . You make it sound very easy . Hey , for you , it will be , toots . Just peel him a few grapes like you did for me , huh ? But remember , Lucky , we have an agreement . I do this job for you ... Yeah , yeah , and I take you to the White House to meet Emperor Calvin Coolidge , okay ? Come on . I have your word of honor ? Look , I 'm telling you , there 's no problem . Me and Coolidge , we 're just like this . Hey , come on . Good evening , Mr. Luciano . There 's some heavy action in the back room , Mr. Luciano . ( GLASSES CLINKING ) Kidnapping ? Is she crazy ? Come on . Wait ! Remember , that 's Lucky Luciano ! Bad guy , right ? Very bad . Then we 'll have to be careful how we get her out of there . How are we gonna get inside ? We 're just a couple of guys looking for a good time . Then I think it 's time we break training . Break what ? You 're a little underdressed for a night out on the town . ( KNOCKING ) Lucky sent me . We 're closing . Lucky said whenever I was in town . Well , I guess you got time for a short one . Hey , no kids allowed . Kid goes where I go . But he 's too young . It ain 't legal . It 's Prohibition , pal . Everybody 's too young . I ain 't gonna call the cops . Are you ? And don 't ever lay a hand on my kid again . Boy , a guy can say anything as long as he can say it tough . Just don 't try any smart moves , huh ? These guys can get pretty rough . You could get into trouble . Hey , I can take care of myself . Face it , kid , you ain 't old enough to be tough . I want you to stay here . Oh , Bogg . And no arguments . Stay . I expected you to find me sooner or later , but right now is a little inopportune . Sorry to inconvenience you , but I 've got to get you out of here . I 'm not going anywhere . Oh , yes , you are . I can 't go back now . I 've got a job to do . We know all about you and your boyfriend 's kidnapping plan . Kidnapping is such an ugly word . This sort of thing happens all the time . In ancient Rome , maybe . Lucky made a very large wager on a sporting event . It 's something about some old man called Homer getting hit . Lucky wants me to stop that from happening . Now , is that so bad ? Yeah . Hey , toots , is this guy bothering you ? Yes , Lucky , he is . Stop annoying the lady , huh ? She 's no lady . ( CHUCKLING ) I mean , she 's just a friend . We sort of lost track of each other over the years . Hey , that 's real nice , pal . The reunion is over , huh ? So , get out ! ( MUSIC STOPS ) ( PEOPLE APPLAUDING ) Wait , Bogg ! Look . It 's Babe ! BOGG : Why would Lucky Luciano want to kidnap Babe Ruth ? JEFFREY : So he wouldn 't hit the homer ! Some hero he turned out to be , beating up on some old guy named Homer . Home run ! Tomorrow must be the day when Babe Ruth is supposed to hit his 60th home run . And Luciano wants to make sure that he won 't , so he hires Cleopatra to keep him busy . Well , he sure got the right girl for the job . Come on . Hey , Bogg , we can 't leave . We 're not leaving . You are . But , Bogg ... These guys play pretty rough . I don 't want you hurt . Bogg ... No arguments ! But Bogg , I have an idea . You remind me of Julius . The same strong profile . Yeah ? This Julius , he 's your boyfriend ? Before he was killed . Sorry . It was a long time ago . A very long time ago . You sure this plan of yours is gonna work ? Sure . I saw James Cagney do it in a gangster movie on TV . Can 't miss . You were right . Kid never could hold his milk and cookies . A very long time ago . I thought I 'd find you here . Hey , what 's the matter ? The Yankee front office send you out here to check on me ? You little two-timing princess . Don 't I recognize you ? Hey , pal , I 'm talking to the lady , okay ? Have a seat . Bogg , will you get out of here ? You 're gonna ruin everything . Bogg ? Julius Bogg . Her husband . Cleo , hey , you told me this guy was dead . Her late husband . You 're not gonna listen to him . He 's mad ! You 're darn right I 'm mad . ( GROANING ) How dare you ! You all right , Cleo ? No ! Hey , pal , that ain 't no way to treat a lady , even if she is your wife . Oh , yeah ? Yeah . Well , how about settling this outside , clown ? That 's a good idea . Maybe I could teach you a little common courtesy . Babe , you can 't leave . I mean , Babe , please , don 't leave ! Babe ! Please don 't leave . This Philistine isn 't worth fighting . BABE : I 'm fighting for your honor , Cleo . Bogg , come on . Babe ! Come on . You and me , buster , we got a little score to settle here , huh ? Babe , please , come back inside . No , not till I teach this guy a little respect . Come on . Put up your dukes . Now , stop this . You 're behaving like barbarians . I don 't wanna fight you . You should 've thought about that before you popped the lady with a grapefruit . Will you just get in the car , I 'll explain everything . Explain it now ! Cleo and her pal Luciano wanted to kidnap you . Now why would we do that ? Yeah , why would they do that ? It seems Mr. Luciano had a bet you wouldn 't hit your 60th home run tomorrow , that 's why . Cleo , what 's this guy talking about ? Babe , I am going back inside , and you are coming with me . ( BOGG LAUGHS ) Bogg , come on ! Sorry , Cleo , he 's coming with us , and so are you . Hey , Mr. Ruth , you wasn 't gonna leave without saying good night , was you ? Good night . ( EXCLAIMS ) Come on . Move over , kid . Hey , this is my turf . I know all the shortcuts . Yeah , great . You can navigate . CLEOPATRA : He 's ruined everything . I command you to stop this car ! No way . You 're too good at getting into trouble . I wasn 't in any trouble until you showed up . And stopped you and Luciano from kidnapping him . What 's a hood like Luciano gonna do for a girl like you , anyway ? Get me an audience with the Emperor . What emperor ? Emperor Coolidge . This dame 's a nickel short . I don 't think Lucky Luciano even knows President Coolidge . I don 't believe you . Did Lucky tell you that President Coolidge isn 't very handsome ? For me it is power , not beauty , that holds the most allure . And he 's a lot older than you . A young man is seldom wise enough to rule an empire . And he 's not gonna be reelected . Can 't this car go any faster ? Take a shortcut , Bogg . Turn here . ( TIRES SCREECH ) BOGG : Faster . Watch out ! ( CRASHING ) ( ENGINE STALLING ) Hey , come on ! That was some shortcut , kid . But there was a street there when I lived in New York . I think we lost one . If I can find a safe place for Babe to spend the night ... And then we 'll take Cleo home after the game . Hey , we can stay at Lou 's . Lou Gehrig 's ? Yeah , where else ? Wow . Here we go , fans . It 's the bottom of the ninth and here comes the Babe . Hey , Jeff , I hope Luciano 's ready to get a new nickname . Today ain 't gonna be his lucky day . I 'm gonna hit the 60th and he 's gonna lose a bundle . MAN ON SPEAKER ... Now batting , the New York Yankees . ( MAN CHATTERING ) ( CROWD CHEERING ) This one 's for you , kid . Babe 's had a perfect day so far , two singles and a walk . But believe me , fans , no one has left this ball park . This is the Babe 's last chance to break his own record of 59 home runs . Set back in 1921 . For six long years , the Babe has been knocking on that door , and this is his last chance in 1927 . I mean , this Yankee team with its famed Murderers ' Row clinched that pennant a long time ago . And my only question to that man is , " Can the Sultan of Swat hit 60 home runs ? " Here 's the wind-up . And the pitch , swung on and missed . Strike one ! Now the pressure down there has got to be tremendous , not only on the Babe , fans , but that pitcher down there doesn 't wanna be known as the man who served up home run number 60 to Babe Ruth . Ball ! Oh , that was blowing away , ball one . Count evens out at one and one . Here 's the wind-up . The pitch , swung on and missed , strike two ! I tell you , the Babe wasn 't just swinging for a single there , fans . He was swinging for those seats . The count now is one and two . One ball and two strikes . Babe is down to his last strike . And here comes the pitch . ( CROWD CHEERING ) You better kiss that goodbye . All right ! Babe Ruth , the greatest home run hitter of all time , has just hit number 60 ! BABE : Hey , kid ! You fellows don 't have to leave , do you ? We got to . Look , I owe you a lot . Thanks . Our pleasure . But promise me , you 're gonna see me next season , right ? Promise ? We 'll sure try . You got a minute ? Oh , yeah , sure . Several years ago I met a boy just like you . I was about to quit the game , but he told me I was his hero . Even showed me a little bit about hitting . Turns out kids with curly black hair must be my good luck charms . Bogg , did you see him ? Down two strikes , and the Babe still came through . Well , with two strikes I would have thrown them a slider . You double-crossing little bimbo . Bogg , I think I want to go back to my own time after all . Can you kiss me now ? But it 's not the kiss ... Shut your trap and hold on . ( PLUMMETING ) ( ALL GRUNT ) Uh-oh , it 's the Romans . CLEOPATRA : It 's Mark Antony . Don 't worry , he 's harmless . He 's always had a crush on me . He doesn 't look so bad from here . Oh , he 's as strong and as handsome as any man I 've ever met , but he has no craving for power . Rest your horses . It 's been my experience that behind every great man , is a great woman . Power is an acquired taste . Maybe I could teach him to savor it the way I do . But there 's one thing I could never teach him . What 's that ? To kiss me as you did . Such an embrace can never be taught . Yeah , I guess . CLEOPATRA : Here I come , puppy dog ! Cleopatra , is that you ? Yes , Mark Antony . Is that the disguise you used to escape from Rome ? Yes . Do you like it ? Your beauty overwhelms whatever costume you wear . May I declare my devotion to you ? Of course . Might I also declare my long , secret love for you ? If you must . But , please , Mark Antony , whatever you do , don 't ever call me " toots . " JEFFREY ... If you want to learn more about Babe Ruth , Cleopatra or Sir Isaac Newton , take a voyage down to your public library . It 's all in books ! We 're transporting the most important prisoner in history . JEFFREY : That was Abraham Lincoln . I heard the Rebs had kidnapped him . No wonder the South is winning . We 're going to shoot this scum right here and now ! Put him up against that wall . London , 1832 . Get to it , Fagin . Move . Oh , sorry , governor . Can 't see a thing in this bleeding fog . And pickpockets ! Bogg , the Omni ! This could be worth a lot . Considering a man 's going to die for it . BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . Green light , kid ! We did it ! ( MEN WHOOPING ) In the name of the Confederate States of America , I order you to stop this wagon ! Never ! Jump , honey ! ( WIND WHISTLING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( MEN WHOOPING ) ( CHUCKLING ) Sorry about the horse there . I ... You dirty blue belly ! Hey , now hold on . I didn 't wanna land on you any more than you wanted to land on me . Okay . Bogg , look out ! No ! Leave him alone . Hey ! Hey ! Put me down ! Don 't hurt him ! He 's just a kid ! Put me down ! Put me down ! We 've been tracking them folks all day . We finally get them out in the open so I could have a little fun with them , and what happens ? Thanks to you two , they get away ! I guess I 'm just gonna have to have my fun with you . BOGG : I don 't understand it . We helped the couple get away . It ought to be green . ( OMNI BEEPING ) Something else must be wrong . Where are we ? Pennsylvania . 1863 . Pennsylvania ? With all these Confederate soldiers ? Let me see . Oh , no . What 's wrong ? This is Gettysburg , Pennsylvania . November 19th , 1863 . So ? So I 'm not sure , Bogg . But I think today is the day Abraham Lincoln 's supposed to be here , making the Gettysburg Address . ( MAN EXCLAIMS ) Looks like you boys are gonna be having yourself a little company . This is crazy . The North won the Civil War . BOGG : Not from the look of these guys , they didn 't . Where 's your uniforms ? We ... We thought we might be safer without them . I know some others tried that . Didn 't work for them , either . The Rebs figure any man who ain 't in gray has gotta be on the run . It 's the same thing clear to Canada . Clear to Canada ? Didn 't you hear about Stonewall Jackson 's march through Ohio ? Nothing but scorched earth behind him . He cut the Union right in half . I heard the Rebs have even got gunboats on the Great Lakes now . What about the Battle of Gettysburg ? I thought that stopped them cold . Battle of Gettysburg ? There wasn 't any battle at Gettysburg . That bad ? That 's bad . Come on , get a move on . Get some food on the table . Where 'd you find these two ? In a tree . They jumped us . What were you doing up a tree ? Somebody chase you ? ( GUFFAWING ) What do you think you 're doing ? Chasing some Yankees . Having a little fun . No harm in that , is there ? We 're in charge of transporting the most important prisoner in history , and you 're out having fun ? Now , what if something had happened ? Nothing 's gonna happen . The war is all but over , anyway . Then you just give a gun to one of those Yankees . Let 's see if they think it 's over . You fool ! You know who she is ? No . What are you looking at ? Go on , get in there . Go on . What happens if the South does win the Civil War ? Are you kidding me ? You 're the history book in pants . What would happen ? Well , there wouldn 't be a United States anymore . And 100 years of history would be totally different . I guess we better find out what went wrong , huh ? Yeah . But how ? We 'll ask somebody . Come on . Come on , you guys . Move through that line . Come on , come on , keep on moving . I sure hope there 's something left for us . Sure am hungry . Better get used to it . I hear they 're taking us to Andersonville . I still can 't believe we 're losing . Losing ? It 's as good as over . I heard they 're even evacuating New York City . New York ! Get ... Wait your turn like everybody else ! Boy , you better back off while you still can . Bogg , forget it . The stuff I used to feed my dog smells better than this . Bogg , look . JEFFREY : That 's Abraham Lincoln ! BOGG : Are you sure ? JEFFREY : Sure , I 'm sure ! Everybody knows Abe Lincoln . No wonder the South is winning . And no wonder the Omni is red . BOGG : Was that really President Lincoln ? I heard the Rebs had kidnapped him , but I didn 't want to believe it . How 'd it happen ? We heard they stopped his carriage on the way home from some party . STEVE : Right in broad daylight , too . Do you know when it happened ? Sometime back in the spring of ' 62 . Look , I don 't feel much like talking anymore . Oh , sure . Yeah , I understand . Want this ? I 'm not very hungry . Thanks . What would Lincoln be doing here ? They wouldn 't keep him in a place like this . When we came in the gate , that woman was saying something about being in charge of the most important prisoner in history . They must be moving him from one prison to another . How are we gonna find out what happened ? There 's someone we could ask . Lincoln ? Look at all the guards around his tent . We 'll never get close enough . Not dressed like this , we won 't . On the other hand ... All right ! Where do you think you 're going , boy ? I 'm going to pick up his dishes . Sentry ! Wait . Sentry ? You go ahead , but you be quick about it . Yes , sir ! ( CHUCKLING ) At ease , just wanted a light from your fire . Yes , sir . I 'm sorry , sir , I was ... Orders are orders . Yes , sir . Mr. President ? My dishes are on the table . Mr. President , please don 't give up . We 're gonna get you out of this mess . No , no , no , no , please . I admire your courage , son , but no . I don 't want anyone else to die . How did it happen ? How did they kidnap you ? Well , what does it matter now ? Well , it matters to me , sir . Please , sir , I know I 'm just a kid , but I 'd really like to know . Well , I was betrayed by one of my closest aides , a Lieutenant Bates . Turned out to be a Confederate sympathizer . He gave a rebel spy the route my carriage was taking back to the White House from this party Mrs. Lincoln and I were attending . The lady had a squad of disguised rebel soldiers waiting for us . The spy was a lady ? Jane Phillips . She and one of her men are out there now . So that 's who that woman was . One more thing , sir . When did it happen ? I need to know the exact date . You 're from Atlanta ? Yes , sir . Well , there 's a whole branch of the Bogg family in Georgia . Bogg ? Yes , sir , I have heard the name . You probably know some of my cousins . Beauregard Bogg ? No ? How about old Jefferson T. Bogg ? No , sir . I don 't reckon as I 've met up with any Boggs lately . Oh , it 's a shame . Sure you have , sentry . You 've met up with Yankee Bogg . In fact , you 're talking to the dirty , uniform-stealing blue belly right now ! You still think the war 's as good as over ? Take that jacket off of him . I don 't want your Yankee sweat to ruin a fine uniform . We 're going to shoot this scum right here and now ! Put him up against that wall . REB OFFICER : Sentries ! I need a firing squad over here ! Get over here . Don 't worry , Mr. Lincoln . Bogg , get the Omni . April 18th , 1862 ! Hit it ! ( BELLS TOLLING ) ( LAUGHING ) What are we waiting for , Fagin ? Patience , my little Dodger . Our pigeon will be landing soon enough . He 'd better be . Don 't worry , Sikes . You 'll be having something to make your purse jingle before too long . Come on , you two . ( WIND WHISTLING ) Are you all right ? Yeah . I 'm just catching my breath . That was a close one . Where are we ? This isn 't Washington , D.C. Yeah , I know . I only got as far as the April 18th part . Oh . Like I said , Sikes , a gift from God 's own hand . ( DINGS ) London , 1832 . And it 's green . Sure nice to be somewhere where there 's nothing wrong . Except the weather . Come on , let 's get warmed up and get back to Lincoln . Well , move . Did Lincoln tell you what happened ? It was a woman . Isn 't that always the way ? Oh , sorry , governor . Can 't see a thing in this bleeding fog . Come on , you two ! Or I 'll take my hand to the both of you . They sure were a ragged bunch . Yeah . Sure was a bad time to be poor . The streets were filled with beggars and thieves . And pickpockets ! Bogg , the Omni ! JEFFREY : This is so awesome ! It 's like a swap meet back home . We 've been walking around this city all day . What are we doing here ? We 're miles from where they stole the Omni . Wouldn 't this be the perfect place to sell it ? Who is gonna buy it ? We 're the only ones who know what it 's for . I don 't know . My mom used to have a necklace with a big metal thing on it . Maybe some lady could wear it as jewelry . I see what you mean . I think I 'll take that . The Omni would look kind of nice on her . Not now , Bogg . Oh , it 's so beautiful . Bogg , the pickpockets from last night . That 's one of them ! Look ! Are you sure ? Sure , I 'm sure . And look . They must be the other two . The keys are in her purse , all right . That 's a good Dodger . Now , move ! ( GIGGLING ) I 'll get you ! BOY : Oh , no , you won 't ! DODGER : Oh , yes , I will ! Come on , yeah . ( GIGGLING ) Fagin , catch ! I got it , Bogg . Fagin , you rat ! Get back here and help us . Let go ! You wouldn 't hit a couple of kids , would you ? BOGG : Oh yes , I would ! Are you okay , ma 'am ? Thanks to you . Here 's your purse . Oh , thank you . Thank you . Is there anything I can do to repay you ? Just knowing that they didn 't hurt you is reward enough for us . Right , Father ? ( SIGHS ) Right , son . Well , I hope to see you and your son again sometime . Thank you . Hey , what about us ? What about you ? We 're giving you over to the police . Unless ... Unless what ? Unless you take us to Fagin . Sorry , mate , I don 't have any openings right now . I 've got all the help I need right here . Look , either you take us in , or we 're gonna turn you over to the coppers . You let your boy speak for you ? My boy is very smart . So is mine , smart and fast . Fast enough to pick the Lord Mayor 's pocket before he can finish sneezing . But not so fast he can 't be caught . True . Sadly , true . If you join us , how do you expect to share ? Equally . In the risk and in the prize . How should I trust you ? I don 't know anything about you two . You 've seen us in action . What else do you need to know ? What do you think , my babies ? Should we give them a go ? I say we put them to a test . Especially that one ! He looks too sweet to be one of us . Hey , man , you wanna step outside , I 'll show you how sweet I am . That 's fine with me , little man . Hold on , hold on . We can 't be fighting each other . He started it . And I 'm gonna end it . No , I am going to end it . We 're planning a little adventure tonight , Nancy , the Dodger and me . I tell you what . The boy can go in the Dodger 's place . If he does well , we 'll gladly take you in . He 's not taking my place ! FAGIN : He is this time ! Now , you stay there , and you be glad you got an ear for me to grab . What do you say , lads ? Are you game ? Wouldn 't be here if we weren 't . ( CHORTLING ) Come on . Get that stew going ! We 'll have a prize worth celebrating when we come back . What 's going on here ? Who was them two with Fagin ? Just a couple of blokes like us . They want to team up . Fagin 's not taking them on the job , is he ? The boy 's taking my place . Stupid ! Stupid ! Don 't you know who they are , you little scum ? They 're the two what you picked clean last night . The two that had this . What 're we gonna do , Bill ? We 're gonna wait . We 're gonna wait and see if they bring back them jewels , or the coppers . Oh , they 'll stay out of the coppers ' way , Bill . You can bet on that . Is it coppers you fear the most , boy ? No , Bill , it 's you . We 're afraid of you . ( STAMMERING ) They 'll bring back the jewels , Bill . I know they will . They better . Because if they don 't , you 're gonna be feeling the full wrath of Bill Sikes . You hear me , boy ? Bogg , we can 't really break into somebody 's house . We have to stay close to Fagin . He 's got the Omni . Maybe we can warn them somehow . Knock over a garbage can , make some kind of noise . Quiet ! Fagin 'll have your ears . Come on . Come on ! There 's a box of jewels in that bedroom that 'll put us on easy street . This is it . BOGG : We can 't fit through that . He can . Me ? Why me ? You 're taking the Dodger 's place tonight . Come on , boy , we haven 't got all night . Where does this hole go ? Into the pantry . Open the door . We 'll be waiting . ( GRUNTS ) WOMAN : Hello ? Is there someone in there ? Is there anybody in there ? Bogg ! Bogg , help me ! Help ! There 's someone in the pantry ! Run ! We can 't leave without him . If we don 't , we 'll be going to jail with him . Come on ! ( DOOR OPENS ) ( DOOR CLOSES ) Why didn 't you tell me it was Marion Brownlow 's house ? I could 've gotten invited to tea or something . She thinks I 'm a hero . Not anymore , she don 't ! We have to go back and get Jeff . As far as I 'm concerned , he can fry in his own fat . He can tell the police how to find this place . That would be a fatal mistake , for both of you . Who 's this ? This is my mate , Bill Sikes . Name means nothing to me . Oh , it will before you leave this place . If you ever leave this place . Pay attention to me , laddie , listen good to old Bill here . When old Bill has something to say , I might start to listen . I think you 'll be interested in what I have to say . Because , you see , we have a common interest in this . Uh-uh ! He 's the pigeon from last night ! Of course he is , you idiot ! That 's right . It 's mine , and I want it back . Oh , you can have it back . In exchange for what ? There 's a box of jewels in that Brownlow girl 's bedroom . Yeah , and we 'd have had them , too , if you 'd let me do me job ! I want them jewels . I don 't care how you do it . You put on some decent clothes , get back into that girl 's house and bring me them jewels . And when you do that , you can have your trinket here . And save your own skin . ( SNICKERING ) Here . I 'll take good care of this . This could be worth a lot . I hope so . Considering a man 's going to die for it . But you 're certain he didn 't hurt you ? How could he ? He was too busy hurting himself . Besides , he 's only a child . Marion , sometimes you 're a very naive young lady . I 've spent a good deal of time studying these London street urchins . They are children only in years . It 's not the fault of the children . It 's those awful men who train them how to be thieves . Oh , Charles , wait until you meet him . He 's so beautiful , and smart . Did you eat your soup ? Oh , thanks . It was great . ( CHUCKLES ) Jeffrey , I 'd like you to meet my fiancé , Mr. Dickens . Charles , this is Jeffrey Jones . How do you do ? Charles Dickens ! Do I know you , son ? No , but I know you ! I mean , I know of your work . You 're a writer , aren 't you ? You can read ? Of course . He is remarkable . Jeffrey , I 'd like you to tell Charles about that awful man who taught you how to steal . What was his name ? Bogg ? Bogg 's not the awful one . It 's Fagin . Fagin ? You mean you don 't already know about Fagin ? I 've heard of men like him . In fact , I 've even been thinking of writing about them . " Fagin . " Has a sort of evil ring to it , don 't you think ? ( CHUCKLING ) You two talk . I 'm going to see what 's happened to our tea . Now , tell me about this Fagin character . Well , these guys are bad . ( INAUDIBLE ) ( CHUCKLING ) Hi . I came to see Jeffrey . I almost didn 't recognize you . If you don 't leave right this second , I 'm calling the constable . Wait , please ! You have to believe me . Jeffrey 's ... I don 't have to believe anything of the kind ! That boy 'd be much better off if he never saw you again . Now , go away . We were off to such a good start . Don 't you remember yesterday when I saved you from the purse snatchers ? That was a trick . You just wanted to find out where I lived . No ! It was a trick , all right , but I wanted to find out where they lived . They stole something from Jeffrey and me . They already know where you live . They just wanted the keys so they wouldn 't have to break in . They 're after your jewels . And you 've come here to get my jewels for them . If I wanted to rob you , why would I be telling you all this ? To trick me again . Ask Jeffrey if I 'm telling the truth . He 's in the parlor . Jeffrey ! Bogg ! Hey , kid , easy . You okay ? Oh , sure . I just fell into some boxes . How about you ? Did you find the Omni ? We 're in big trouble . There 's another man , Bill Sikes . He makes that Fagin guy look like a saint . ( CLEARS THROAT ) This must be Bogg . Yes , sir . This is my friend , Phineas Bogg . And this is Charles Dickens . How do you do ? Hello . Bogg , this is the Charles Dickens ! Yeah , I said hello . A Christmas Carol . Bob Cratchit ? Tiny Tim ? Scrooge ? Remember ? Marion , you seem to have misjudged these two . Yes . And for once , I 'm very happy to be wrong . Scrooge ! I remember him . I think it was Christmas . Something like that . Jeffrey has been telling us about some of the fascinating characters you two have met . Oh , I can 't wait to put them on paper . I wish we had more time to talk about it , but we really have to get going . Don 't you think , Jeffrey ? Bogg , look . The window ! It was Fagin , and another man . Sikes . My Lord , they must 've followed you here . I 'll get the butler to call for a constable . No , wait . I have a better idea . What are we gonna do ? How are we gonna get past them ? By going in two directions at the same time . What ? If you can do that , sir , my hat 's off to you . You can keep your hat . Just give me some of your help . There he is ! Good day , Mr. Bogg . Come back anytime . Look out ! He 's alone . What do you think he 's up to ? Nothing we agreed to , that 's for sure . Come on . I think it 's time we took care of this one . Can I help you ? No , I thought you were someone else . I thought that might be the case . Good day . You fool , they tricked us ! Come on ! I want you to wait out here . Why ? Because I have a plan . Give me 10 seconds and start pounding on the door as hard as you can . Why ? Just do it , okay ? Where 's Fagin and Sikes ? Coppers got them . Fagin said to get the loot and get out quick . Where 's it hidden ? Come on . Hurry ! The coppers are right behind us . The coppers are right behind us . ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) See , I told you ! Where is it ? The fireplace . Over there . There 's a loose brick up in the corner . Right here . ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) Don 't just stand there ! Go out the back way . I 'll be right behind you . Go on ! Any problems ? Just a couple of small ones . Come on . Come on , Fagin , hurry ! There they are ! Now what ? Washington , D.C. , 1862 , right ? April 18th . They 've disappeared ! They can 't have done ! BOGG : Jeffrey , we said Washington and here we are . JEFFREY : Yeah , at a park . Hey , kid , I go for the soft landings every chance I get . All we have to do is replace Lincoln 's disloyal aide , this Lieutenant Bates and see that Jane Phillips doesn 't get the correct route back to the White House . Sounds good . What do you mean , it sounds good ? It is good . What 's wrong with it ? Well , Jane Phillips is no dope , right ? Right . What if she already knows what Lieutenant Bates looks like ? Presidents have more than one aide . She 'll get suspicious if he shows up with someone else . Oh , I don 't know . What if Bates ' replacement is someone who has a way with women ? A unique brand of charm , someone who is debonair , sophisticated , good-Iooking ? Okay , I 'll do it . ( LAUGHS ) ( CHAMBER MUSIC PLAYING ) ( MUSIC STOPS ) Ladies and gentlemen , the President of the United States , and Mrs. Lincoln . ( ALL APPLAUDING ) ( BAND STARTS PLAYING ) Mrs. Lincoln 's coat . Take good care of it . JEFFREY : Lieutenant Bates ? A Miss Phillips would like to see you , sir , in private . Up there . She said she 'd leave the door open for you . Thank you , boy . She is magnificent . Cool it , Casanova ! Remember , she 's a spy . ( MUSIC STOPS ) ( PEOPLE APPLAUDING ) How 'd everything go with Lieutenant Bates ? Don 't worry about him or the beautiful lady . JEFFREY : Looks like you got her attention . Are you sure she won 't recognize you from the stockade ? Relax ! All that hasn 't even happened yet . Excuse me , Mr. President , could I have a word with you ? Yes , what is it , Lieutenant ? I have some bad news about Lieutenant Bates . I 'm afraid he 's come down with something . A little food poisoning , they think . Oh , my . Well , where is he ? He 's resting . He 'll be fine in the morning . I 'm assigned to fill in for him . I don 't remember seeing you around the White House . No , sir . You wouldn 't have . I just returned from the front . Oh , yeah . What front ? The Western Front ? Ah . It 's been a hard campaign out there . I wish I could bring all of you men back for a good rest . You 're doing a fine job . Thank you , sir . If there 's anything I can do , just let me know . At the moment , my only order is that you have a good time . Yes , sir . I 'm certain I can handle the assignment . ( BAND STARTS PLAYING ) Thank you . My pleasure . If a man was ever born to wear a uniform , it 's you . There are other uniforms I prefer . A lighter color might be more complimentary to your eyes . And closer to my heart . Lieutenant Bates couldn 't make it . He sent me in his place . Well , I think he made an excellent choice . Well , thank you . Would you care to dance ? I 'd be delighted . ( MUSIC STOPS ) ( PEOPLE APPLAUDING ) ( BAND STARTS PLAYING ) You dance beautifully . I suppose you do everything this well ? Many things I do much better . And you 're sure about the route ? Absolutely . Are you sure of your men ? They 'll be in place . Make sure they know whose side I 'm on . Don 't worry . I 'd never let anything happen to you . ( CHUCKLES ) ( MUSIC STOPS ) A messenger will be waiting to take the route to my men . I 'll be right back . Well ? I gave her the route back to the White House . What ? The wrong route . ( SIGHS WITH RELIEF ) ( CHUCKLING ) Will you relax ? I 've got her wrapped around my little finger . Well , then , I guess that does it . I guess so . You know , I gotta tell you . You were really hot out there . I didn 't know you could dance like that . Are you kidding ? ( OMNI BEEPING ) Didn 't you ever hear of Nijinsky ? Come on , Bogg . You 're not gonna tell me you taught Nijinsky how to dance ? Taught him ? Wednesday matinees , I was Nijinsky . Bogg ! Look . Now what 's she up to ? Oh , Lieutenant ? Yes , sir ? I 'm ready to leave now . Would you get the carriage , please ? Yes , sir . Oh , and by the way , Lieutenant , I 've invited Miss Phillips to join Mrs. Lincoln and me at the White House for coffee . I 'll get her carriage , too , sir . That won 't be necessary . The President has graciously invited me to ride along with him in his carriage , and I would very much like it if you 'd join us . I 'd be honored . Yes . This should be the perfect end to a perfect day . We 'll meet you in the foyer . Jane , won 't you come help me find Mrs. Lincoln ? Oh , of course . Now what ? She 's in for a big surprise . By the way , how are you gonna get to the White House ? Don 't worry , I 'll hitch a ride . When the President told me that you were a hero who 'd just returned from combat , well ... I want to hear everything . Yes , Lieutenant , we 'd all be most interested to learn your impressions of the action . Well , I 'm sure it 's just like any other war . Why is it that the real heroes are always the modest ones ? What 's going on ? We 're supposed to be taking Rock Creek Road . I guess there was a change in plans . Well , there 's gonna be another change in plans . Do you know what you 're doing ? What this will mean ? It will mean that Jeff Davis will be sleeping in the White House before Christmas . Now , tell the officer to get back on the other road . Lieutenant , stop the column . Halt ! Halt ! We 'll take the country route after all . Column left , ho ! This way is much prettier , and far more isolated . Jane Phillips , a traitor . I can 't believe it . Not a traitor , Mr. Lincoln , a patriot . Two patriots , in fact . ( MEN WHOOPING ) JEFFREY : Oh , no ! All right . Take it easy and everything will be all right . All right , climb down from there . Everything all right in there ? Everything in here is just fine . Soldier , take my horse . Everybody , just sit back and relax . We 're gonna take a little ride down to Richmond . What are you doing ? Changing a patriot back into a traitor . What ? BOGG : Open the door . ( URGING HORSE ) ( EXCLAIMS ) Whoa , whoa ! Stop ! JEFFREY : Stop ! Slow down . Whoa , slow down ! JEFFREY : Slow down , whoa ! Slow down ! ( YELLING ) Stop , horse ! Whoa , boy , whoa ! Slow ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Yeah ! Okay , that 's good . Wow , kid . Where 'd you learn that trick ? Western movies . John Wayne made it look easy . Yeah . Well , there 's a big difference between you and John Wayne . Yeah . About four feet . Mr. Lincoln , Mrs. Lincoln , you all right ? Yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , we 're fine . Fine . Now , there , there . Thank you . If it hadn 't been for you two , I ... I don 't know what to say . Don 't worry about it , Mr. President . When the time comes , you 'll know what to say . Bogg , are you sure this is the right date ? ( DINGS ) November 19th , 1863 . Are you sure this is the right place ? ( PEOPLE APPLAUDING ) Come on , Bogg . Hurry . Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent , a new nation , conceived in liberty , and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal . Now we are engaged in a great civil war , testing whether that nation , or any nation so conceived and so dedicated , can long endure . We are met on a great battlefield of that war . We have come to dedicate a portion of that field , as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live . JEFFREY ... If you want to learn more about Abraham Lincoln , the Civil War , or the works of Charles Dickens , just take a voyage down to your public library . It 's all in books ! There he is , Bogg ! That 's Old Hickory ! General Jackson ! Fire ! Where 's Captain Lafitte ? He 's a French pirate . He 's supposed to be fighting for Jackson now . Hey , don 't be leaving me so fast . I know where the pirate 's treasure is hidden . Hello , matey . JEFFREY : Bogg , there 's five more of them . Voyagers don 't run from a fight . JEFFREY : Bogg ! BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! Hey , they 're coming ! They 're coming ! Scatter ! Scatter ! Clear the street ! MAN : Come on , boy , let 's go ! ( PLUMMETING ) It sure is quiet . Too quiet . ( BEEPING ) New Orleans , 1850 . Yeah , so what 's wrong ? Beats me . Something 's gotta be wrong , the Omni 's red . So are their uniforms . Whose uniforms ? Stop it ! Let go ! Shut up , Yank , or we 'll hang you ourselves . Go back to England ! This is our country ! Leave him alone ! After them ! Get those kids ! This is all wrong , Bogg . The redcoats aren 't supposed to be ... ( GUN FIRES ) Shooting at us ? You 're telling me , kid . Come on , run ! What are they shooting at us for ? Because we 're not on their side . How do they know ? Wait a minute . Whose side are we on ? The American side . That the same side as those kids throwing rotten tomatoes ? ( GUN FIRING ) Great . Wait ! We 're on your side . What 's going on ? What is that all about ? Haven 't you heard that the redcoats have declared martial law ? You mean the British are in control of the city ? They have ever since the Battle of New Orleans . Come on , Sam , run ! Where have you guys been ? Who 's that guy those soldiers were dragging off ? That 's one of Jackson 's officers . They 're gonna string him up . What happened to General Jackson ? Nobody knows . I sure hope he got away . We were supposed to win the Battle of New Orleans . What happened ? How did they break the American line ? What about Jean Lafitte ? Jean Lafitte ? The only Lafitte I know is Pierre Lafitte . Maybe they 're related . Where can we find him ? He 's got the bakery shop across the street over there . Look , we 're forming a resistance group . You know , an underground . There 's a meeting tonight at St. Anne 's Church at 7 : 00 . If you 're with us , you be there . ( GUN FIRING ) Sure is confusing . What should 've happened ? General Jackson 's troops routed the British out of the middle of some swamp . The redcoats didn 't even get close to the city . The victory made Old Hickory a national hero . He 's supposed to be elected President in 1828 . What about John Lafitte ? Jean Lafitte . He 's a French pirate in control of the swamps . He 's supposed to be on our side . I guess we better find out what happened . Come on . Are they gone ? Yeah , but they 'll be coming back . It 's terrible . Terrible . They treat us like slaves in our own country . Did you ever hear tell of another Lafitte , Jean Lafitte ? He was my brother . Was ? He 's been dead a long time . Did you know him ? We knew of him . I don 't care what anyone says , Jean was a fine man and a wonderful brother . Who said he wasn 't ? People . Liars . Why ? What happened ? He was charged with piracy and hanged by the Spanish . But it wasn 't true . When did it happen ? The summer of 1798 . It was one of my first trips to New Orleans . He sent me a letter saying that he had found lodging at over a tavern in Nassau , Two Maids From Bristol , it was called . Here they come ! Everybody off the streets . ( GUN FIRING ) Mr. Lafitte , let us in . There 's two of them ! Get them ! I think I 've seen enough . We gotta get the rest of the story from Pierre . We gotta find out what happened to Jean . We got a date and a place . That 's plenty . You stay where you are ! You 're right . That is plenty . What ... Where did they go ? Where are they ? What happened ? Hurry , will you ? I 'm doing it as fast as I can . ( PLUMMETING ) This doesn 't look like the Bahamas to me . Must 've stuck on automatic again . At least nobody 's pointing guns at us . Try bows and arrows . CLARK : They 're turning tails . They 're running . If we spent 100 years trooping around this country , I 'd still never be able to figure out those people . I guess they must 've seen what one of these can do to a man . Ah , excuse me . We didn 't mean to scare you . Where did you two come from ? From Canada . We 're trappers . Who cares where they came from ? Boy , other than our party , you 're the first white faces we 've seen in months . Where is the rest of your party ? Camped a few miles back . I 'm William Clark , this is Meriwether Lewis . This is Phineas Bogg . I 'm Jeffrey Jones . Hello , Jeff . JEFFREY : It 's great to meet you both . I thought Clark and Lewis were comedians ? That was Martin and Lewis . Oh . Bogg , these are America 's greatest explorers . Oh . What were you doing up in that tree ? We were trying to decide whether to follow that ridge or go down through that valley . See , I figured if I got up in that tree , I could get a better look . I got a feeling that ridge is gonna lead to the edge of a cliff . There could be a river down in that valley . Or a box canyon with sheer walls . At least we can see where we 're going if we follow the ridge . But the flow of the river will take us toward the ocean . So will the sun . How do you know there is a river down there ? You know , sometimes , William , you 're such a dreamer . I think America 's greatest explorers are lost . I 've got an idea . Instead of standing here talking about it , why don 't we all go a little ways along the ridge ? Maybe there 's a spot where we can get a good look down into that canyon . The boy has a point . And if your instincts are correct , we 'll be that much further on our way . All right , I 'll lead the way . JEFFREY : Check the Omni , quick . ( BEEPING ) Red light . Must be the other trail . Hey , wait ! Look , down there , through the trees ! Isn 't that water ? Maybe it 's a river ! I don 't see anything . Neither do I. All right , Meriwether , let 's try it your way . We 'll stay on the ridge . Look ! The Indians are back ! Where ? On the trail ahead . I don 't see anything . Yeah , well , that 's the way it is with the Indians around here . So clever you never see them until it 's too late . Way to go . Well , maybe we should try that other trail . You thought you saw water down there , didn 't you , son ? Well , it sure looked like water . Can 't hurt to take a look . Just in case . Green light . Hey , did you really see Indians ? Did you really see water ? ( BOTH LAUGHING ) Oh , Nassau , right ? 1798 . Okay . Come on , lads , time be a-wasting ! Look lively , there ! The tide will be on us soon enough . ( PLUMMETING ) Hold it , lads . Move along . Move along ! ( OMNI BEEPING ) One thing 's for sure , it 's a beach . 1798 , the Bahamas . Right where we 're supposed to be . Okay . Yeah , but on the second try . So , which way is Nassau ? We got to find Lafitte . Down the beach , around those rocks . You sure ? Hey , kid , I was a pirate long before I was a voyager . Where do you think I got these clothes ? Come on . You know , Jeff , I have a good feeling about this place . Hey , Bogg , what 's behind these rocks ? Bogg , look ! Hello , matey . Come here , boy ! I want to talk to you . Bogg , help ! So , it 's two snoopers who 'd steal an old sailor 's prize , is it ? What 's he talking about ? I didn 't know you were there . Honest , I didn 't ! That 's your hard luck , sonny . ( GRUNTS ) Mates ! Over here ! Wait here . Come on , Bogg , let 's get out of here . No way , kid . Voyagers don 't run from a fight . On the other hand , voyagers aren 't stupid . Come on . Get after ' em ! Come on , kid , we can outrun them ! Hurry , lads , we 're gaining on ' em ! Don 't let ' em get away ! Come on ! Oh , forget it , we 'll never catch ' em . BOGG : See , I told you we could outrun them . JEFFREY : My feet are killing me . This is it . What do you think of Nassau ? Wow , this place is great ! You should 've seen it 100 years ago . Now , those were the good old days . Some of the greatest pirates in all of history walked these very streets , Captain Kidd , Calico Jack , Blackbeard . And Jean Lafitte , remember ? Yeah , I didn 't forget . It 's just that , well , some of my best friends have been pirates . You know , you would have made a great tour guide at Disneyland . Disneyland ? Is that a country ? ( CHUCKLING ) Bogg , give it up . Look , there it is . Two Maids From Bristol . You wait out here . I 'll see if I can get a line on Lafitte . Wait , I want to go with you . What if that guy with the black eye patch is inside ? I 'm not scared of him . MAN : Stay out of here , you scurvy bum . On the other hand , that 's probably not much of a place for kids anyway . I 'll be right back . Hey , fellow , watch your step there , huh ? Got a couple of coppers for an old sailor ? Maybe next time . Please , matey , anything 'll help . BOGG : I 'm sorry . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) ( MUSIC STOPS ) ( MURMURING ) ( MUSIC PLAYING ) ( PEOPLE LAUGHING ) Hello . PARROT : What 'll it be , mate ? That 's enough of that , now ! That 's enough of that , now ! God save King George ! You be quiet on your perch or I 'll wring your neck . Haven 't seen you around . Yeah , I just got into port . If you 're looking for lodging , I got two rooms left . I don 't know how long I 'll be staying , it all depends on whether I can find the brother of an old shipmate or not . Oh ? What might his name be ? Jean Lafitte . So , it 's Jean Lafitte you 're looking for . You know him ? Oh , indeed I do . He 's right over there , having a little chat with Lizzie . He must tell a good story . He does have a way about him , that one . Think I 'll go over and say hello . Thanks a lot . Hey ! Hey ! Don 't be leaving me so fast . I was just starting to like you . It 'll just be a minute . He 'll be there . Besides , it 'd be rude to interrupt right in the best part of his story . ( CHUCKLING ) You know , I 'll bet that you have a few stories of your own to tell . You 've probably heard them all . Why don 't you let me be the judge of that ? Got a penny for an old sailor ? BLIND MAN : Help a poor , blind man , mate . MAN : Get out of the way , you old bum . How about a hand , mate ? Help a poor , blind man . Here you go . Hey , let go ! Open your hand . Is that all you got , boy ? No , sir , but ... Hey , wait a minute , you 're not blind ! And you 're not doing enough to help the poor . Now give me your purse and be quick about it ! No ! Bogg ! Let me go , you old bum . BLIND MAN : Come back here . You little ... Come back here ! Where are you , boy ? Are you hiding in here ? You won 't get away from old Rufus . Where 'd he go ? Get you , boy . I 'll get you . SCROGGINS : In here , Scar , so we can talk in private . SCAR : This better be good . Come on . All right , Scroggins , let 's have it . There 's a Spanish merchantman due in the harbor any day now . I hear tell she 's as ripe a prize as my good eye has ever seen . Silks , lace , barrels of rum bigger than that one . A chest of gold . Payment for the goods she delivered to Veracruz . Now , what do you say , Scar ? Would old Bill Scroggins steer a poor man 's course ? With enough likely lads as yourself , we can take her easy . You already have the rest of the crew ? Some 's aboard already , clamoring to set sail . The others are down at the Two Maids From Bristol . What are they doing down there ? Why aren 't they out helping the others ? 'Cause they don 't know they 're part of the crew just yet . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) A couple of friends is recruiting ' em just now . All we 'll have to do is pick ' em up just afore we sail . What do you say , Scar , are you with me ? I 'll probably be with you in hell , Bill Scroggins . At least we 'll be together . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) ( MUSIC PLAYING ) Now , you 've seen Pierre . My brother is well ? You 're sure of it ? Yes , when I saw him , he was as fit as I am . Jean , can 't we talk about this later ? I haven 't seen my brother in two years . I wasn 't even sure if he was alive . He said if I was ever in Nassau , to be sure and look you up . Are you sure you don 't want anything to eat ? No , thanks , I 'm fine . What did he say ? Did he have a message for me ? Yes , he said to tell you to come to New Orleans . I 've heard it said that a man can make his fortune in New Orleans . A man can make his fortune right here in Nassau . Besides , how could I leave my Lizzie ? That 's right . Your brother 's gonna be awfully disappointed . It sounded like he misses you a lot . I miss him , too , but New Orleans is so far away . Not that far away . Why don 't we go down to the harbor right now and board a ship bound for New Orleans . You can 't leave . We only just met . But don 't you see ? It 's best this way . There 's no sad memories and all that kind of junk . What 's wrong with him ? Are you okay ? You 're going on a ship all right , but it 's not to New Orleans . You 're going with him . Oh , my head hurts . What are we doing here ? We 've been shanghaied . Annie and Lizzie are going to sell the lot of us to be crew on some ship . Not just some ship . Black Bill Scroggins ' ship . Big guy with a black patch over one eye ? You 're sure it 'll be Bill Scroggins ' ship ? I saw them two ladies talking to him the night before they snatched me . ( LAUGHS ) Perfect ! Perfect ? They drug your food , lock you up in their basement and sell you onto some pirate ship where you 'll probably end up as some shark 's lunch , and you call it perfect ? Yes . I 've been trying to figure a way to get close to Scroggins for weeks . He 's supposed to have a chest full of gold and jewels that he took from the Manila Galleon . Why didn 't you just offer to sign on his ship ? He 's too suspicious . Besides , no one ever wants to join one of his crews . I don 't believe this guy . Bogg . Don 't worry , he 's a friend . Kid , you okay ? I 'm fine . How about you ? In shock . I tried everything I could think of to save this guy , but no dice . He wants to be shanghaied . I bet you can 't guess whose ship we 're gonna end up on . Oh , yes , I can . Black Bill Scroggins ' ship . And that 's not the worst part of it . I overheard Scroggins planning to attack a Spanish merchant ship . Pierre Lafitte said it was the Spanish that hanged Jean for piracy . That 's why we 've got to get you and him out of here , and fast . The only way of getting him out of here is to carry him . Why does he want to be on Scroggins ' ship so bad ? He wants to get near Scroggins so he can get his treasure . You mean the one we saw them burying ? Must be . The women who run the tavern , what are their names ? Anne Brown and Lizzie ... I don 't know . Why ? I 'm gonna go have a talk with them . About what ? Buried treasure , what else ? ( HORSE SNUFFLING ) Somebody 's coming . Got to go . Jeffrey , wait ! Not too much now , Your Majesty . Not too much now , Your Majesty . All right , what 's wrong with you ? We ought to keep those two for ourselves . I was starting to like the new one . There 's plenty more where that scurvy pair came from . Just wait till the next ship comes in . Who knows ? Prince Charming himself might be on board ! Right . Searching the world to find the perfect lady to be his queen . Lucky for him he 's got two of us to choose from ! ( LAUGHING ) Hey , hold on , boy ! What do you want in here ? I 'm looking for the owner . You 're looking at the owner . One of them , anyway . Where can we talk ? " Where can we talk ? " Over here . The name 's Jones , Jamaica Jones , off the brigantine Shark just out of the Dry Tortugas . Well , I 'm Anne Brown , this is Lizzie Palmer . So , what 's this all about ? It 's about buried treasure . That 's what it 's about . He 's a little young to be Prince Charming , but ... Maybe he 's looking for a Queen Mother . As you were saying ... I know where a pirate 's chest is hidden , and I 'm willing to cut you in for a share . Oh , you are , are you ? Why me and Lizzie ? I mean , you don 't know us from old Eve herself . You 've got a mate of mine locked up downstairs in your cellar . And I want him back . In the cellar ? What are you talking about ? I 'm talking about a chest this big , full of gold and jewels . ( PARROT SQUAWKING ) Maria ! MARIA : Sí , señora , what do you want ? I want you to keep an eye on the place . We 'll be gone a while . I don 't want to escape to New Orleans and start a little shop with Pierre . I want to stay here . I like being a pirate . I know . I 've been a pirate for longer than you 'd ever believe . But I 've known them all and you 're special . You 're a natural born leader . You 're gonna do something important ... Yes , one day when I have my own ship . Captain Jean Lafitte , they 'll call me . Not if you join up with Scroggins , they won 't . How could you know that ? You can 't know the future . No , but I know what the great captains of the past were like . They were like me ? Oh , yeah , very much like you . ( DOOR OPENS ) Move ! ANNIE : Now , get back ! How could you do this ? How could you sell me to that awful Bill Scroggins ? It was easy . Hey , you 're coming with us . And one more man to help with the shoveling . Pick one . Quick . MAN : Take me . I 'll go . I 'll do it . This one . Me ? Dig ? I 'm sick . I can 't go . We 're gonna dig up Scroggins ' treasure , you idiot . But , on the other hand , maybe a little exercise would make me feel better . Nice job , kid . It 'll be easy to slip away once they get their hands on that treasure . If I can just remember exactly where they buried it . Over here . I think this is it . You think this is it ? Here . You heard him . Start digging . Where ? Where is it ? It 's here someplace . This is a big beach , kid . When we start digging through the jewels , it will be easy . You take Anne . I 'll take Lizzie . Hey ! Cut the gab ! You 're here to dig ! ( SQUAWKING ) PARROT : What 'll it be , matey ? Look out ! Parrot soup 's what it 'll be , matey ! Yes ? Where 's Anne and the other one ? Not here . I 'm watching the place . Well , they 're supposed to be here . We got business , me and them . Sorry . You 're gonna be more than sorry if you don 't tell me where they went . They left with a boy . Boy ? Black , curly hair ? Red shirt ? The little weasel ! ( SQUAWKING ) Hey , watch it , matey ! ANNIE : What are you gonna do ? Dig up the whole beach ? That tide must 've buried it deeper than I thought . But it 's here , believe me . JEAN : That 's it ! You found it . ( JEAN LAUGHS ) JEFFREY : See ? I told you ! Come on . ANNIE : Hurry up ! Get it out of there ! Lift it out ! This is very heavy . That 's because it 's very full . So , we meet again , mateys . What do you want here , Bill Scroggins ? That 's my chest you 're digging up . The chest belongs to whoever can hold on to it . ( ALL LAUGHING ) I think we better help these ladies . They can take care of themselves . Come on , lads . Lizzie , give me your sword . If you want a cutlass , you get one from them ! Look out , kid . JEFFREY : Look out ! JEFFREY : Bogg , there 's another one . Behind you ! Now , now , Annie , don 't make me hurt you . Don 't worry about me , Scroggins . Look out for yourself . Not bad for a woman ! ( YELLS ) Watch it ! I 've got you now , my beauty ! Get up and fight ! Come on , Scroggins . Say good night , you slimy little miscreant . Next time , I 'll cut it off . JEFFREY : Way to go , Bogg , just like Errol Flynn . Come on . ( LAUGHING ) BOGG : Now we 've got him . And now you don 't . ( SCREAMS ) Okay ! Now , what are you gonna do ? Don 't touch that sword . That 's it , run ! Come on , Bogg . ANNIE : Bogg , look out ! Hey , you 're pretty good with a sword . But how well can you swim ? ( EXCLAIMS ) Yeah ! Look at them run ! Yeah ! Looks like we did it , kid . Let 's get that chest open . Help me . Great fight ! Yeah ! You two are something else . Lizzie ! You were magnificent ! Back off ! But Lizzie , you 'll need someone strong to help you carry it to town . Uh-uh-uh . You 'd be surprised how strong two ladies can be when they want to be . JEAN : But Lizzie ... Get out of here ! All of you ! Wow ! What a couple of tough chicks ! Okay , we 're going . We get the message . And just keep going . I don 't believe this . We had the treasure in our hands , and we lost it to those women . Don 't feel bad . Those two are not ordinary women . Listen to him . If anyone knows women , it 's Bogg . Thanks , kid . I think . The women of New Orleans , what are they like ? BOGG : Far more beautiful than the women of Nassau . And more gentle ? Much more gentle . You know , my friend , I 've been thinking about what you said . This place is not for me . The people , they don 't know a natural leader when they see one . I think I shall find that ship you were talking about and go to New Orleans . I have a feeling you 're gonna do big things in New Orleans . ( SCOFFS ) ( CHUCKLES ) ( DINGS ) JEFFREY : Green light ! You know , kid , in all my years as a voyager , Lafitte 's the only one who ever tried to stop me from getting him out of trouble . But you did it . You got him started in the right direction . Yeah , but what if he makes a wrong turn somewhere between here and New Orleans ? You know , Bogg , I 've always wanted to meet Andrew Jackson . Well , you 're gonna get your chance . JACKSON : Keep a sharp lookout , men . Sharp lookout ! Wake up , there , Kelly . You can sleep for a week when this is over . It won 't be too much longer now . See anything ? Nothing yet . Why did it have to be foggy today of all days ? I don 't know that that fog means anything to get all riled up about , Mr. Bundy . They can 't see us any better than we can see them . You got a point , Andy . ( PLUMMETING ) One good thing about swamps , they 're soft . Yeah , and foggy . Just how it 's supposed to be . Is it the right date ? ( BEEPING ) January 8 , 1815 , and it 's red ! Maybe it 's not Lafitte . Let 's find out what 's going on . It 's going to be Lafitte . I know it is . Keep a sharp lookout there , boys . There he is , Bogg ! That 's Old Hickory ! General Jackson ! Where have you two fellows been ? We 've been waiting for you . You have ? Sure . For the flints and powder . Where 's Captain Lafitte ? You mean he isn 't with you ? Well , no . He took some of his men to bring back the flints and powder , which we desperately need . They 've been gone all night . They should 've been back before now . You can say that again . You two are with Captain Lafitte ? I mean , the way you 're dressed , I thought ... Yes , sir , we are with Captain Lafitte . We were supposed to meet him here at dawn . Well , it 's almost dawn . I hope for all our sakes he gets here pretty soon . We need his flints and we need his men . Don 't worry , General Jackson . He 'll be here in plenty of time . I knew it was Lafitte . Maybe he 's in some kind of trouble . He 's in trouble , all right . With me . Bogg , we 've gotta find him . The redcoats will attack at dawn . Without Lafitte 's men , without his flints and powder , there 's no way the Americans can hold them off . Yeah , all right . Start asking around . We have to find out where he was going . Look alive , men . BOGG : Must 've missed him . It 's getting lighter all the time . This has to be the right trail . It 's the one they said he 'd take . MAN : Finally this bloody fog is beginning to clear . Get down ! MAN 2 : Good . The sun can 't come out soon enough for me . You think we ought to try another trail ? No ! We 're already lost . We could walk right into the Yank lines . Why do they have to be lost right on our trail ? Bogg , look . Lafitte ! I knew he 'd be in some kind of trouble . Shh ! Stay where you are . Get back . Stay down . This is great . Just great . What are we gonna do ? It 's dawn ! The redcoats are gonna attack any minute now . Remember Lewis and Clark ? Lewis and Clark . Lewis and Clark ! Yeah , right ! Indians ! Right ! Ready ? Come on ! Hey , don 't shoot ! The Indians are after us . Indians ? I thought the colonials were up that way . Yeah , maybe they are , but you got to get past the Indians first . Yeah , and there must be 1000 of them right behind us ! A thousand of them ? Thank God you got weapons . Do you have any extras ? I don 't see anything . That 's the way it is with these Indians around here . They 're so clever , you never see them until it 's , well , too late . I couldn 't have said it better myself . One thing 's for sure . I won 't be caught out in the open like this . Down here , quick ! Go ahead , we 're right behind you . Take cover . Every man for himself . How good are you at dying ? I don 't know . I 've never tried it before . You never played Cowboys and Indians before ? Oh , that kind of dying . Well , hey . Okay , on the count of three . Ready ? One , two , three . ( BOTH GROANING ) Indians ? But I didn 't hear any gunshots . And I don 't see any arrows in them . Then what happened to them ? I don 't think I want to find out . Retreat ! Retreat ! Wake up , Bogg . Captain Lafitte is safe now . Come on . Let 's go . But don 't I know you ? We 'll talk about it later . You go on . We 'll catch up to you . Thank you , my friends . Thank you . I shall not forget this . Let 's go . Come on , Bogg , let 's get back to General Jackson ! MAN : The powder and the flints are here . Hurry up and get them passed out . Careful with that , kid , it 's heavy . No , I can handle it . Let me help you with that . Thanks . Looks like we made it . Yeah , check the Omni . I 'm afraid to . Thank you very much for helping us back there . We could not have made it without you . Lucky we happened to be there when you needed us . Again . I 'm sure I 've seen you somewhere . From Nassau . The Two Maids From Bristol ? Anne Brown ? You gotta remember Lizzie . But you 'd have to be much older ! That 's clean living for you . Say , what ever happened to your brother , Pierre ? He 's back at the boats , unloading . He 'll be as surprised to see you as I am . Get some of that powder down to battery C ! Yes , sir . Captain Lafitte ! Take some of your men down there , too . That battery could use some riflemen . Men , follow me ! Bring them on , Andy , we 're ready for them . Hold your horses , Mr. Bundy . Hold your horses . They 'll be here soon enough . Keep down , kid ! General Jackson ! I heard what you did for Captain Lafitte . He would have made it without us . That 's not what he says . When this is over ... ( BAGPIPES PLAYING ) JEFFREY : Bogg , what 's that ? BOGG : It 's the British , Jeff , they 're coming . This is it . Jeff , get back . I told you to stay down . ( EXPLOSION ) Nobody fires till I give the order ! ( EXPLOSION ) Fire ! Fire ! Fire ! ( EXPLOSION ) ( GUNS FIRING ) Reload and keep firing ! Reload and fire at will ! Retreat ! Retreat ! All right ! You did it , men . They 're running . They 're turning tail , Andy ! They 're running ! We did it ! We did it , Andy ! We did it ! We beat them ! I believe we did , Mr. Bundy ! I believe we did . JACKSON : Well done , men . Well done . What a victory ! Back in Nassau , long ago , you said I do something important in New Orleans . How did you know ? Sometimes I get these hunches about people . I had a feeling destiny had something planned for you . But to be part of such a victory , I never dreamed of being part of such a thing . Thank you , my friends . Thank you . You know , if he only knew how important this victory really is . What do you mean ? Well , this battle showed everybody the United States was no one to mess around with . These redcoats we beat were the best army in the world . They were the ones who beat Napoleon . Why didn 't you tell me that before the battle ? Pretty soon they 'll be calling General Jackson " The Hero of New Orleans . " I hope not . I don 't deserve it . Everybody here is a hero . My Kentuckyans , Captain Lafitte and his men , and the two of you . I said before the shooting started , I wanted to thank you personally when this was over . Oh , sir , just being with you here is all the thanks I need . Well , it 's not all the thanks I have to give . Mr. Bogg , raise him up here . For bravery in service of your country far beyond the call of duty . ALL : Hip , hip , hurray ! Wow ! When you grow up , son , get in touch with me . I have a feeling you 're gonna be a man who does some great things . Thanks . Let 's go , men . Here , Bogg , you deserve it more than I do . Oh , I don 't know about that . Besides , it looks better on you . JEFFREY ... If you want to learn more about Andrew Jackson , Jean Lafitte or the War of 1812 , take a voyage down to your public library . It 's all in books ! Who 's the boy , anyway ? Bogg , who is this guy ? This guy happens to be one of the greatest voyagers who ever lived . Kneel , dog ! Kneel in the presence of Great Kublai Khan . If Marco Polo doesn 't meet Kublai Khan , it 'll foul up Europe 's whole understanding of China . ( GRUNTING ) ( SOLDIERS CHEERING ) ( SOLDIERS SHOUTING ) The Karaunas ! SOLDIER : Run for your life ! Jeffrey ! Bogg ! BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! ( PLUMMETING ) Terrific . Another three feet that way and we would 've landed on the bed . Don 't complain . Three feet this side and it 'd be the birdcage . Whoa , I 'm freezing . New York . December 11 , 1930 . Recognize the date ? Fourteen days till Christmas . ( CHUCKLES ) That 's a lot of help . Nobody 's perfect . Hey ! Get out of there ! Hey ! Look out , kid ! Hey , what are you guys doing ? You chumps or something ? You could 've got youse moidered . We could 've got us what ? Moidered , moidered , moidered . As in dead . Right . Now get out of here ! Get out ! We 're going . We 're going . Okay , Charlie , take it up . Was that English ? Brooklynese . Don 't knock it . The guy saved our tubas . Our what ? Bogg , look . BOGG : Who is it ? A politician ? JEFFREY : Try physicist . That 's Albert Einstein . Einstein ? You mean E equals ... What is E equal ? E equals mc-squared . Right . Is he supposed to be here ? I think so . JEFFREY : I know he came here from Germany sometime in the ' 30s . Well , whatever 's wrong probably has something to do with ... Bogg , look . Youse , watch it ! It 's gonna fall ! WOMAN : Oh , my God . I 'm sorry , Mrs. Einstein ... Doctor ... I didn 't mean ... I mean , I hope I didn 't ... You hope you didn 't save us ? No , it 's just that I didn 't really mean to ... Yeah , well , say what you mean then . What I think he means is he hopes he didn 't hurt you . Exactly . Hurt us ? How much could hurt when you saved our lives ? Thank you . I am eternally grateful , Mr ... Bogg . Phineas Bogg . And this is Jeffrey Jones . Hi . I 'm a big fan . ( CHUCKLES ) A fan ? I feel like an American movie star . Oh , sure . We studied all about your theory of relativity at school . Energy is equal to mass times the constant , which is the speed of light , squared . Yes . It applies to light energy in relative time . You learned about light energy and relative time in grammar school ? No , see my father , he 's a professor . A physicist . That would explain it then . Such a smart boy . All right , youse , everybody out of here ! We got to clean up ! I 'm staying onboard the Belgenland . Pier 9 . You must have dinner with me onboard tonight . 8 : 00 . I could be talked into playing the violin . I don 't think ... We 'll be there . Good . Auf Wiedersehen . So nice to have met you . Come , my dear . REPORTER : Jeffrey Jones , smart kid . Dr. Einstein , does your theory suggest that time travel is possible , sir ? EINSTEIN : Time travel ? Yeah . I suppose that is a possibility . ( EINSTEIN LAUGHING ) I don 't know why you told him we could have dinner . Are you kidding ? Pass up a meal with one of the greatest minds of our time ? Well , I 'm telling you , forget it . I 'm telling you , I 'm hungry . ( DINGS ) Green light , kid . Now come here . Hey , there ! Come back here . No way . I 'm staying for dinner . Jeff ! Hey , you two ! Wait ! There 's no way , I 'm getting anywhere near you . Look , I 'll make it up to you . Don 't waste your breath . Hey , voyager ! Voyager ! Voyager ! ( PANTING ) You want I should have a heart attack or something ? You 'd think that you young tykes don 't have ears , the way you listen . Bogg , who is this guy ? Who 's the boy , anyway ? Wait a minute , who are you ? Me ? I 'm Isaac Wolfstein . You , you 're a voyager . But the kid , the kid I don 't understand . Since when do voyagers have little sidekicks to get in the way ? Isaac Wolfstein ? You 're not ... You couldn 't be ... Wild Man Wolfstein ? Well , not so wild anymore , but who 's to complain ? But you 're a legend . Barely in my time , maybe . Bogg ? This is Jeffrey Jones . I 'm Phineas Bogg . Bogg ? No , I 'm afraid that must have been behind my time . Bogg , who is this guy ? This guy happens to be one of the greatest voyagers who ever lived . Him ? Jeffrey ! No , no . It 's all right . Look at me . A pathetic old man in a uniform that needs pressing . Is this the proper end for a voyager ? I don 't understand . What happened ? Well , I retired . They took my Omni , they took my Guidebook , they handed me my pension fund and they said , " Where do you wanna go ? " And you picked here ? Oh , why shouldn 't I pick here ? In 1925 , this was a wonderful place to be . Beautiful city , beautiful women , beautiful stock market . Stock market ? You mean you didn 't know about ... What am I , a fortune teller ? I should know the stock market 's gonna crash ? But your Omni ... My Omni only went up to 1925 . Oh . Yeah , " Oh . " I lose my entire pension , he says , " Oh . " Look , I 'm sorry . You 're sorry . Everybody 's sorry . You work your whole lifetime for humanity , you sweat and slave , then you get old , and what do they do ? They throw you away and say , " I 'm sorry . " Bogg , maybe we should just skip dinner and get out of here . Wonderful ! It would be wonderful to get out of here . BOGG : Look , Isaac ... Take me anywhere . Only , there shouldn 't be any people . I hate crowds and money . Isaac ! Money , I 'm sick of dealing with it . Hey , hey , maybe there could be a nice beach . ( STAMMERS ) And some fruit to pick to eat . And some fishing . I like that . All right . All right . Look , we 'll drop you off on an island in the South Pacific . But after that you 're on your own , okay ? Bless you . May all your landings be soft . I thought I told youse guys to get out of here ! We 're gonna , we 're gonna . Gee , you didn 't have to do that . ( EXPLOSIONS ) Careful . Careful , watch his leg , Jennie . Yes , ma 'am . Watch it . Easy , Jennie , easy with him . There ! There ! There ! Try to make him comfortable . Try to make him ... I 'm going back to help the others out . ( PLUMMETING ) You want to know why old voyagers retire ? This is why old voyagers retire . Where are we ? This isn 't the South Pacific isle . Bogg ? BOGG : It 's stuck in the automatic mode again . So why aren 't you taking good care of your Omni ? This is what I get when I ask for sun and sand ? ( BEEPING ) Bogg , where are we ? You have to ask ? If you were old enough to have a brain in your head , you would know that this is a war . Eastern part of France . 1870 . Got any ideas ? You are going to ask a 12-year-old boy ? I think it 's the Franco-Prussian War . You think ? Why don 't you check your Guidebook ? Bogg , look ! Somebody needs help . Come on . Are you crazy ? Somebody could get killed out there ! On the other hand , wait for me ! Take it easy , easy on the leg . Anything we can do to help ? Yeah , just help me and Ms. Barton get them into the trench . We 'll fix the wagon when the shelling stops . Clara ! Everybody stay down ! I have to get her out of the wagon ! You stay put . Nobody moves . Wouldn 't think of it . Clara ! Get him out . You got to go now . Not until they 're all out . ( COUGHING ) Come on . Come on , help us ! Are you out of your mind ? Come on . I told you to stay back . Give him to us . Where 's Ms. Barton ? She won 't come until everybody 's out . Can I come help ? The answer 's no . I 'll die if anything happens to her . Did you say her name was Barton ? Yes , it 's Clara Barton . That 's it ! What ? Clara Barton founded the American Red Cross . There is no American Red Cross . There will be one . Here , take him . You 're gonna be okay ? Yes , I will be all right . I think I can make it out on my own . ( COUGHING ) Where 's Clara ? Right behind ... Clara ! Clara . Clara . ( BOMB WHISTLING ) Clara ! Clara ! JENNIE : She 's not breathing . That won 't work . Give me a shot . Hey , Jeff . I know what I 'm doing . I 've never seen this done before . Are you certain ? ( COUGHING ) You did it . You did it . And you say you learned that technique in a Red Cross program ? Junior Lifesaving Course . A lifesaving course . I never heard of such a thing . You will . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Your patients are all onboard and the wagon 's fixed , Clara . Thank you . I 'm sure they 'll receive much better care away from the fighting . Without you around , I doubt it . Do you have to go ? We 're just passing through . Right . We 're just passing through . See you , soldier . Bye . Bye . Coming ? Bye . Bye . Now , can we go to an island ? My ears are still ringing . Will you quit complaining ? Complaining ? Who 's complaining . Will you two guys grab on ? ( PLUMMETING ) Where are we , Bogg ? July 1st , 1946 . On one of the Marshall Islands . Well , could be a little bigger , but it 's better than the Bronx . Is the light green ? The light 's green . Is it gonna stay green ? Kid ? It 's gonna stay green . I don 't trust him . You should look in the Guidebook , make sure it 's gonna stay green . Look , I told you , it 's gonna stay green . World War II is over . The United States is in control of these islands . There 's nothing gonna happen for at least 30 years . Is it too much to ask you should check the Guidebook ? Look , just forget it . Did I say something wrong ? I just wanted to check the Guidebook . He is the Guidebook . Jeffrey , come back here . You mean that now they give you a smart-faced kid instead of a Guidebook ? I lost mine . ISAAC : You lost it ? Do you know what they could do to you ? You lost your Guidebook ? BOGG : I didn 't have a choice . My Omni fouled up and put me in 1982 . I lost my Guidebook , I picked up the kid , now I can 't get back , understand ? No . Look , the kid and me do okay . Jeffrey ! Then you should teach the kid to have more respect . These kids nowadays . Does he often run off like this ? You should put him on a leash . Jeffrey , come back here or I 'm gonna leave without you . You wouldn 't leave me here with him . Try me . That 's the way to handle a kid . Say you 're sorry . Sorry ? Because I wanted to read the Guidebook , I should be sorry ? Say you 're sorry or you 're going back to the city . The city ? I 'm sorry , already . I 'm sorry . I take your word for it . This is a wonderful island . Now shake . Now can we get out of here ? Now . Well , Isaac , nice meeting you . It 's been my pleasure . Bon voyage . Well , the sand 's not so bad . It 's a shame there aren 't more trees . Could die from sun poisoning without any shade . And there 's probably sharks . Water this blue always has sharks . So who 's to complain ? It 's better than the Bronx . ( PLUMMETING ) Alone at last . Where are we ? BOGG : China . August 13 , 1275 . You know you could 've been a little nicer to him . Was he nice to me ? Well , you could 've at least treated him with a little respect . I mean , after all the guy is a ... I know , I know , a legend . But I 'll tell you , for me , he was a royal pain . 1275 . You got any idea what 's wrong ? The date 's familiar . Well , I 'll tell you , kid , sometimes you just got to sit around and wait . Bogg ! What ? Bogg ? What ? I think you should see this . Hi , guys . Just catching a little shuteye . Kneel , dog ! Kneel in the presence of Great Kublai Khan . By all the laws of my empire , you should be dead by now . Sitting on my chair , looking directly at me when you speak , your mere presence in the royal garden , all are punishable by death . And yet , if you can answer one question , I shall allow you to go free . This one 's all mine . Where are my emissaries to the Christian Pope ? Where are the brothers Polo ? Take it , kid . Bogg , that 's it . Marco Polo 's supposed to be here . 1275 's the year he arrived . Well , don 't tell me , tell him . The Great Khan awaits an answer . Emperor Khan , are you saying the Polo brothers haven 't come yet ? Nine years ago they set out to bring the teachers from your Christian Pope and holy oil from Jerusalem . Three years ago , I received word that they were returning and had passed through Kirman . Then nothing . It was as if they had disappeared . Kirman , that 's in Persia . ( BEEPING ) You seem to be acquainted with the Polos . Tell me where they are now . We don 't know , Emperor Khan . Then I sentence you to die . Oh , but we 'd be more than happy to find out . ( BEEPING ) Hang on . ( JEFFREY EXCLAIMS ) JEFFREY : I can 't figure out which has worse fleas , this horse or this vest . See anything ? Maybe over the next rise . That 's what you said eight rises ago . I know . Oh , my tuba . We can 't give up . If Marco Polo doesn 't meet Kublai Khan , it 'll foul up Europe 's whole understanding of China . All right . The guy in Kirman said the Polos were only a half day ahead of us . They got to camp sometime . What if what 's happened to them has already happened ? If what 's happened to them has already happened , the Omni 'd be red . Right ? Right . Green . Great . ( MEN SHOUTING ) You hear that ? Sounds like it 's ... Just over the next rise . Come on . Come on . ( BLEATING ) ( SOLDIERS CHEERING ) Come ! Marco , don 't be a fool ! Give it to him ! What 's the matter with you ? This is the holy oil . Marco , we 'll trade a few horses and get it back for you . All the horses in Cathay won 't buy you a new head . ( GRUNTING ) That look like him ? Give it to me . Give me . Looks right to me . Stay here . Give me . Give it here to me . You can 't go in there . Are you crazy ? Excuse me . Hi . Look , I 'm sure this is just a misunderstanding . Now if you two would just step together and shake hands like gentlemen ... ( OXEN GRUNTING LOUDLY ) Is he with you ? God rest his soul . That 's not exactly what I had in mind . Couldn 't we just talk about it , maybe some other time ? JEFFREY : Look out . On the other hand , if you want to fight ... JEFFREY : All right ! Quick learner . Oh , no . Come on . Sure you wouldn 't like to talk about this ? Bogg , the pole ! The pole ! Grab the pole and pull . JEFFREY : Bogg ? BOGG : Jeffrey ? Are you okay ? Jeffrey , where are you ? Over here ! Over where ? Over here ! Come on , I think there 's a way out , but we 've got to find ... Marco . Good fight . Wonderful fight . Now , we eat . They call him Oxen , in the plural , because he 's bigger than any single ox . You 're a lucky man to have come out in one piece from that fight . You certainly saved our Marco 's head . How 'd it start ? We were on our way to the Great Kublai Khan in order to deliver some papers he requested from the Pope and a bottle of holy oil from Jerusalem . Is that what 's in the box ? Yes . Oxen , the Chief Tartar , admired it , and I refused to give it to him . So what ? It 's yours . Not according to Tartar custom . Here , if you have something which someone openly admires , you give it to him . Don 't let him see the Omni . The what ? Nothing . It 's just that I can 't believe anyone would make up such a stupid custom . That 's what Marco thought , too . That 's what got him into all this trouble . Well , I guess I have a lot to learn before I become any kind of a traveler . The first is to respect the law of the land one travels in . I 'll drink to that . Is there something wrong with my drink ? What is that stuff ? It 's ox milk and blood . Drink it with a smile . I just got something stuck in my throat . This drink 's wonderful . Every last drop , Bogg . More drink for my friend ! BOGG : You can 't be serious . Bottoms up , Bogg . Somebody give that man a medal . Dry fog ? The dry fog is up on us . Dry fog ? What 's the matter with fog ? It 's not the fog that 's the trouble , it 's what the fog brings . What 's that ? The Karaunas ! ( ALL CLAMORING ) The horses ! Get the horses ! They 'll come from the hillside . You there , get the men on the high side ! Hurry . ( SOLDIERS SHOUTING ) Bogg ? Marco ! Jeffrey ! This way . Follow me . Where 's Bogg ? Bogg ! SOLDIER : The Karaunas ! Run for your lives ! Bogg ! Jeffrey ! Come ! But I can 't find him ! Come on , boys , run ! Jeffrey , come on ! Bogg ! Come on . ( MEN SHOUTING ) There . This way . Jeffrey ! Jeffrey ! Jeffrey ! Jeffrey ! Jeff . Jeffrey ! ( GROANS ) Jeff . Marco ! ( BEEPING ) Jeffrey ! Jeff ! Marco ! Jeffrey ! MAN ... ( ON PA ) Blast area clear . We have blast area clear at one minute and counting . Fifty-five seconds . ISAAC : You lost him ? You lost Marco Polo and the young boy in the middle of Persia ? How could you possibly do that ? I already told you . The Karaunas . The Karaunas . So why don 't you find the Karaunas ? Because I don 't know anything about Karaunas . I didn 't even get a chance to see one . So why don 't you know something about the Karaunas ? You were sleeping when the subject came up in voyager school ? Yeah , something like that . MAN ... Test area is all clear of personnel . Forty-five seconds . Look , it 's a long story . Will you stop sounding like my mother and tell me what you know ? Well , it 's possible I could be persuaded . I 'll persuade you . I 'll persuade you until you can 't stand up . All right . All right . Don 't stretch the collar . I just wanted you should take me off this godforsaken little island . All range observers should have eye protection in place . Thirty seconds . There 's sharks in the water , nasty little crabs in the sand ... The Karaunas ! The Karaunas , right . The Karaunas is half-Tartar , half-Indian marauders . They use the fog in that region to conceal their attacks . What do they do with their captives ? Well , they kill them or they sell them as slaves . Where ? In that same region where you were attacked , possibly Hormuz on the Gulf . Thanks . It 's been my pleasure . Hey , you 're taking me with you ? I am not taking you with me . After all I 've done for you ? After all I 've told you ? You 're going to leave me on this miserable desert island with a bunch of nuclears ? Nuclears ? Yeah . The sign there . That 's what they 're testing . Hey . MAN ... 24 , 23 , 22 , 21 ... I don 't even know what a nuclear looks like . I 've been hunting all over the island trying to find one to talk to . And you 'd think they 'd have the common decency ... Nuclear testing ? ... to give a simple description . Bikini Atoll . MAN ... 2 , 1 . ( EXPLOSION ) And what was that ? That was a nuclear . And that nuclear , that 's what that boy of yours said was in a green light zone ? That boy of mine is named Jeffrey and it was a green zone . That was supposed to happen . It 's just that I didn 't put you on the right island . And where do you think you 're going ? AUCTIONEER : Do I hear nine ? To find Jeff and Marco . You want to come along , you keep your mouth shut . How do you expect to find him if you don 't even know what a Karauna ... I am as quiet as Grant in his tomb . What are my bid for this hand maiden ? I want 10 pieces of gold . Ten . Do I hear 11 ? Eleven pieces of gold . Twelve . MARCO : No ! You can 't have it ! Please , let the boy keep it . It 's only oil , for the blisters on his feet . If this is oil for his feet , why did he conceal it from us ? My mother in Venice gave it to me . Your mother , huh ? ALL : No ! We 'll take it to the auctioneer . Let him study it . Perhaps this is worth more than all these men and boy combined . And so ends the travels of the brothers Polo and young Marco . Even if we live , without the oil we can 't show our faces to the Khan . I 'm sorry , Uncle , Father . No , there 's nothing you could 've done . Thinking about your friend ? Oh , this is all messed up . You 're never going to make your journey . And I 'm never gonna see Bogg . He wasn 't captured with the others . Perhaps he got away . He would 've been here by now . Maybe he 's trying . A beautiful Venetian glass platter that just came in today . The color , the clarity . There can 't be a more beautiful example in Hormuz . Excuse me , I must do an appraisal . Will you stop that ? That 's a Karauna . Excellent . Genuine indeed . That 's it . Surely one of a kind . That 's the holy oil . AUCTIONEER : Now , back to our Venetian glass . So where are we going now ? If he 's got the holy oil , he 's also got Marco and Jeff . AUCTIONEER : There , I have a bid for two . Who will give me three ? You know the old coin trick gambit ? Know it ? I invented it . You got a coin ? ( SIGHING ) No , I 'm flat broke . Here , use the Omni . They 're making these things out of brass now ? What is the world coming to ? In my day , they were solid gold . BOGG : ( WHISPERS ) Will you come on ? Hello , there . Interested in a little game of chance ? This trinket against that scabbard ? Look at this , look how it blinks . ( BEEPING ) Yeah . Double or nothing ? Triple ? I thought you invented that game . Invented it , yes . Did I say I was any good at it ? Bogg ! Thank God ! How did you get away ? No time to talk , come on . I thought I lost you there . What 's he doing here ? If it weren 't for him , I wouldn 't be here . Let 's go . Come on . Phineas , help , the keys ! Are you hurt ? The keys ! The Omni rolled into the cell . Bat 's breath . In the cells ! Someone 's broken in ! I can 't find the right key . ISAAC : I think I twisted my ankle . CHIEF : Are you thinking of leaving ? ( BEEPING ) This is very interesting , very nice . See ? Little red lamp here . How does it do this ? It comes on and off with a bell . What is it ? I don 't understand . A time machine . A time machine . A time machine . Wonderful . This should bring good price , no ? Very good price . A time machine . A time machine . You always make jokes when you are in trouble ? It helps . I just hope you have a sense of humor when you go in front of the voyager board . You know what they do for a lost Omni ? ( GROANS ) My ankle . No one needs such pain . What no one needs is you . BOGG : Jeffrey ! It wasn 't Bogg 's fault . It was your fault . You 're the one who messed it up . You 're the one who lost the Omni . Hey , hey , hey , cool down , Jeff . No ! He 's a stupid old man ! Everything was going fine until he blew it . He blew it for everyone ! Look , Jeff , I wouldn 't have been able to find you if it weren 't for Isaac . Don 't defend me . Jeffrey 's right . I 'm a worthless old man . Somebody to get in the way . Wild Man Wolfstein . He 's a stranger to me . Somebody who lived a long , long time ago . On your feet . Manacles on the men and the older boy . We 're taking you to the auction block . Two objects for which there is no equal in this part of the world . The first is believed to be , the precious Christian holy oil from Jerusalem . While it may not have religious meaning to you , I assure you it is valuable . The second is a talisman of extraordinary mystery and power , reputed to have been made by a tribe of sorcerers on a faraway isle . He 's close . Maybe if they sell us together , we can get it back . They are not gonna sell us together . AUCTIONEER : This one will go for a price . I will not sell the objects now . I will give you time to look them over . I am sure you will bid for what they are worth . And now the slaves ! Bogg ! Fine young boy , soon to be a strapping young man . Who will give me two gold pieces ? Bogg ? I 'll find you , Jeffrey . Wherever you are , I will find you . Now that I have two , I want three . Three pieces of gold for this boy . Three gold pieces , here . This should never have happened . I want four . Four pieces . Four . AUCTIONEER : Five . Five pieces . MAN 1 : Here 's five gold pieces . I hear five pieces . MAN 2 : Six pieces . Six . I want ... ( YELLS ) Jeffrey ! The wagon ! Go get the wagon ! ( ALL CLAMORING ) Get him ! Oxen . ( JEFFREY YELLS ) Where 's Isaac ? Isaac . Go on ! Leave me ! No , don 't stop , they 'll catch us all . He 's right , boy . Go ! No ! Do what the kid says . Are you crazy ? Don 't stop ! Get as close to him as you can ! BOGG : Isaac . All right ! ( DINGS ) Look ! Now it 's green . MAFFEO : That 's a wonderful trinket . Unlike anything I 've ever seen . Are you thinking what I am ? That the Great Khan would like this , Father ? Marco , now you are thinking like a Polo . All right , Bogg , how much ? Sorry , Nicolo . We can offer you riches beyond your wildest dreams . At least that 's what Father and Uncle tell me . I don 't think it 's for sale , Marco . Jeff ? Isaac ? Thank you all . You 've made this a memorable trip . I think you 'll have plenty of things to remember before it 's through . Goodbye . ( DINGS ) ISAAC : Green light . That always gave me a special kind of feeling . It should . You 're the one who got it that way . Well , I had some help . You know , sometimes when you 're old , you forget what it was like to be young . You start to think that the kids don 't know anything , that you have to be old to have any wisdom . Me , from now on , I listen to the young ones . Even Isaac Wolfstein has got something to learn . Me , too . Just because someone 's old , it doesn 't mean they 're washed up . That applies to me ? You 've got plenty of Wild Man still left in you . Okay , Isaac , name your place . You 've earned it . Anywhere I want ? Anywhere . How about a place by the sea ? A city , a humble job , but steady , a decent subway . How about home ? It 's 5 : 00 already . I 've still got half my streets to do . Phineas . Jeffrey . It 's great to meet you , Isaac . Yeah . You should come back sometime for an egg cream . I know a great place near Times Square . You got it , Wild Man . You know , I 'm gonna miss him . BOGG : Me , too . What 's an egg cream ? It 's a drink . Milk , soda water , chocolate syrup . No egg ? No egg . Well , then why do they call it an egg cream ? You got me . Where you going ? To go have dinner with Einstein . Oh , no , you don 't . We got things to do . Yeah , like eat . Jeffrey ! Forget it , Bogg . I 've had enough of your beef jerky . Hey , come back here . No way , José . Jeffrey ! Jeffrey ! JEFFREY ... If you wanna learn more about the travels of Marco Polo or Albert Einstein , take a voyage down to your public library . It 's all in books ! People all over the world are counting on me to make this flight . Mrs. Lindbergh , how does it feel knowing this may be the last time you 'll see your son alive ? Bogg , he 's not going to make it . Look out ! You 're really Little John and Friar Tuck ? That 's right . JEFFREY ... And there really is a Robin Hood ? Halt ! Ready ? Quick , over there ! Fire ! BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . Green light , kid ! We did it ! ( COUGHING ) ( COUGHING ) ( WIND WHISTLING ) Bat 's breath ! Spilled my guava whip . What are you laughing about ? And what 's the big idea Omniing us out of Hawaii ? I wasn 't ready to leave . Our vacation was over . In case you didn 't notice , I was having a very intimate conversation with a girl in a grass skirt . I noticed . BOGG : Well , did you also notice how beautiful she was , how sweet , how innocent ... How married . Married ? Married . To a tribal chiefsman . She was wife number 18 . Eighteen ! That doesn 't seem fair . A guy with 18 wives . He also had a couple of hundred warriors who were giving you the evil eye . Yeah , they were looking at me kind of funny , huh ? JEFFREY : Like the way they look just before they attack ? BOGG : Yeah , well ... England , 1194 . ( OMNI BEEPING ) Go away , or my next arrow will find your heart . This guy has a funny way of saying hello . MAN : Leave ! Go on ! We better get out of here , Bogg . Go ! Old guy looks like he needs some help . Then why did he shoot at us ? He 's probably afraid . Hey , it 's okay . We just want to help . I don 't want your help . Go ! Hey , kid . Yeah , Bogg ? This old guy 's a real good shot . You still think he needs us ? Yeah , for target practice . Let 's get out of here . ( COUGHING ) Bogg , we 've been walking for hours . Do you have any idea what we 're supposed to be doing ? You 're asking me ? This is great . We 're stuck in the middle of some forest with a red Omni , and don 't have any idea what we 're doing . Well , something somewhere in England is wrong . All we can do is find it . Yeah , well , we better find it soon . My feet didn 't come with a warranty . You know , Bogg , the Omni dropped us near that old man . Maybe he was important . And did you want to stick around and find out ? You there , make way for a better man . We were on this bridge first . Yeah , you should step back . You 'll be the one stepping back . Or I 'll tan your hide until it 's as many colors as a beggar 's cloak . Hey , don 't talk to my kid that way . Why don 't you do something about it ? Or would you be a coward ? Just push him off , John , and be done with it . We haven 't eaten yet . No , good Friar . I think this lad 's ripe for a contest of staffs . Lend him yours . As you wish . But do hurry , my stomach 's beginning to speak to me in strange tongues . Listen , Goliath , why don 't you just step back . I don 't want to fight you . You don 't have a choice . Okay , if that 's the way you want it . Step back , kid , I gotta teach this guy not to mess with a voyager . Bogg , be careful . He looks like an ape in a man 's suit . Come on , Bogg ! You can beat this guy ! Not bad , sir . You 're a fighter . Not as good a one as me . We 'll see about that . Well , he 's a dancer , John . Now let 's find out if he 's a swimmer . Come on , he 's a chump ! That 's it ! Come on , get him ! Again ! Look out ! ( EXCLAIMS ) ( JOHN LAUGHING ) ( SIGHS ) Good move . JEFFREY : Enjoy your bath ? It 's about time you had one . You really taught him not to mess with a voyager . JOHN : Good fight . I respect any man who can swing a staff like that . Yes , indeed . We could have used a man like you . My friends call me Little John . And this is Friar Tuck . I 'm Phineas Bogg . Jeffrey Jones . You 're really Little John and Friar Tuck ? That 's right . And this is Sherwood Forest ? Of course . And there really is a Robin Hood ? There used to be . Bogg , my dad told me that Robin Hood was just a myth . He said if the legends were true at all , they were based on some guy named Robert Hood . Right . Robin 's real name was Robert . He changed it when he became an outlaw . Wasn 't he the guy that robbed from the rich and gave to the poor ? Before he ran out on us . Now , John , don 't be so hard . Robin was one time the hero of all England . Too much ale has made you soft , Friar Tuck ! Well , if your Robin 's anything like the Robin I 've heard about , he couldn 't have done anything that bad . He ran out in the middle of an attack from Prince John 's men . We beat them off , but after it was over , Robin was gone . Doesn 't sound like the Robin I 've heard about , either . When he left , he took our hearts with him . No one had the desire to go on fighting Prince John or his sheriff . Now they have a free and evil hand . JOHN : England 's no longer a fit place to live . We 're on our way to France . And if you have any desire to live , you 'll go as well . Couldn 't Robin have been killed or captured by Prince John ? JOHN : We would have heard . Everyone knew of Robin . And now they hate him . Not I. And not you , I think . He was the bravest man we ever met . No to say , an archer without peer . Well , I don 't know about that . We met an old man in the woods today that could give him a run for his money . The guy could barely stand up but he shot an arrow straighter than I 've ever seen . An old man , you say ? Well , we didn 't see him up close . He might have just been weak , or wounded . Was his bow red in color ? I was paying more attention to his arrows than his bow , to tell the truth , but it looked kind of red . Made out of cherrywood , maybe . Could you take us to this man ? Sure . But when we get close , be careful . This guy doesn 't like visitors . Follow me . JOHN : Robin ! He 's burning up with fever . FRIAR TUCK : And his face is as white as a ghost . My friend . My God , Robin , why did you leave us ? I was wounded . Men should not see their leader in a state of weakness , so I came here to die alone . FRIAR TUCK : Headstrong even in death , eh , Robin ? ROBIN : Where are my men now ? JOHN : Your men are gone , Robin . Is that true , John ? It 's true . All your men have disbanded . Not to mention Lady Marian . Quiet , Tuck ! Yeah , Tuck , easy . Robin 's not well . What about Lady Marian ? Her heart grew so sad that when Prince John said that she must marry the Sheriff of Nottingham , she was too weak to fight . The ceremony takes place in four days . My Marian and the Sheriff ? So you just lie there and die . Good Tuck . Even if I had to crawl , I wouldn 't allow Marian to be forced into marriage . FRIAR TUCK : That 's the spirit , Robin . Here , let me take a look at that wound . BOGG : I 'll get something cool for his head . We should take him to a bleeder . I 've already been bled . Well , no wonder you 're so weak . What did they do , cut you and use those wormy things to suck your blood out ? Well , they used the leeches . JEFFREY : Stupidest thing I ever heard of . My mom used to give me soup to help build my strength . Do you have any soup ? Soup ? BOGG : Listen to the kid , he knows what he 's doing . I can shoot some game . Make a venison broth . Not to mention a nice roast . Oh , yuck ! This is all infected . Well , what do you think ? Is he gonna make it ? I 'll know better when I clean the wound out . I need alcohol . Well , I have some ale . No ! It 'll kill the germs . Germs ? They 're like little creatures that cause infections . JEFFREY : I need clean bandages . Boil some water and put the bandages in them . But the water is unclean . Boiling water kills germs , too . Do as the boy says . Got to bring down your fever . These germ things must be nasty creatures . I don 't think I 've ever seen one . But if I do , I 'll put an arrow right through its heart . How are you feeling , Robin ? Better , thanks to Jeffrey . I want you and Friar Tuck to do me a favor . Anything , Robin . Get my men back together again . Prince John 's tyranny has run free long enough . JOHN : We 'll try , but it won 't be easy . Most of your men think you 've deserted them . They 're scattered all over England . But Marian will be married in four days . We can attempt a rescue . Three men and a boy ? You wouldn 't get past the castle gates . Robin , your men won 't return until they know you 're back fighting again . Then I 'll do just that . ( GROANING ) Forget it , Robin . You can 't get up . Your fever will only come back . But Marian ... You can 't do Marian or England any good if you 're dead . You 've got to rest a few more days . In a few days I can help England , but it 'll be too late for my Marian . Not if I take on Prince John in your place . JOHN : What do you mean ? Well , if I dress like Robin , fight like Robin and use his red bow , maybe people will think that I am Robin Hood . It might work . ROBIN : Maybe . At least until I get my strength back . And the word will spread that I 'm back and the men will return . It 's worth a try . Yes ! To the new Robin of Sherwood Forest . SHERIFF : Are you enjoying our little ride in the country , Lady Marian ? MARIAN : As much as I would enjoy eating live lizards . SHERIFF : My dear , we 'll be sharing more times like this after we 're married . MARIAN : Then I 'll be too sick to do anything . SHERIFF : Of all my duties as Sheriff of Nottingham , I think I enjoy collecting taxes the best . I don 't remember you doing much of that when Robin was around . SHERIFF : Yes . The woods are much safer since he deserted his people . And much sadder , too . Wait ! Wait . Please stop . My leg , it 's broken . We wait for no one . The boy is hurt ! It 's Robin ! Guards , get us out of here . FRIAR TUCK : Get them , Little John . ( GROANING ) Save her , Phineas . Don 't worry . I 'll get her . I 'm coming with you , Bogg . No way ! I got the horse . Smart kids give me a pain . Good luck . SHERIFF : Guards , attack ! It 's Robin Hood ! After him ! MAN : Stop ! Halt ! ( GROAN ) Quick , over there ! Bogg , I think it 's Omni time . I think you 're right . ( BEEPING ) Shoot them ! Don 't let them get away . ( OMNI BEEPING ) Aim ! Fire ! Where 'd they go ? REPORTER : Hey , fellows , it 's Bixby . Mr. Bixby . How does it feel to be backing a dangerous flight ... Relax , boys , relax . Mrs. Lindbergh , how does it feel knowing this may be the last time you 'll see your son alive ? Did you know what a dangerous trip your son was taking ? Did you know a lot of experienced fliers have died trying to cross the Atlantic . Doesn 't that worry you , Mrs. Lindbergh ? Come on , how about a nice mother-son embrace . JEFFREY : That was great ! All that empty space and you land us right in the middle of a mud puddle . BOGG : I don 't have any control over the landing . You know that . You didn 't break Robin 's bow , did you ? No . But the Omni got quite a dunking . Where are we ? Just a second . What 's the day ? I 'll tell you as soon as I clean this thing off . I wonder what 's wrong . I wonder what the cure is for a kid that asks too many questions . Bogg , look . Mrs. Lindbergh , did you come here to talk your son out of making this flight ? No ! Please , please just leave me alone . I don 't need any Omni to tell me that pushing a lady around is wrong . MRS. LINDBERGH : Leave , Charles , please . MAN : Hey , that 's enough , fellows . Get back now . ( MRS. LINDBERGH CRYING ) Bon voyage . Let go of the lady 's arm . Get out of here . I said let go of her arm . Why , you stupid ... Ok , buster , now you did it . These hands are licensed weapons on five continents . Bogg , that move never works . Yeah , well , that move always does . Bixby , you see that Mother gets to the train all right ? BIXBY : Of course . Charles , I just talked to the other bankers on the phone , and they 're very disturbed ... We 'll talk about that later ! The storms haven 't changed in a week . Bixby , get her out of here ! Sorry about that , you guys . I didn 't mean to hurt anybody . Look at these guys , costumed bodyguards . He says he doesn 't like publicity . Does your mother know what a dangerous line of work you 're in ? Let 's have a touching embrace ? Why don 't you get a picture of this , send it off to your editors . That 's one for you , Lindy . Lindbergh 's revenge , huh , guys ? I don 't know who hired you to do that for me , but I 'm grateful . Are you really Charles Lindbergh ? Yeah , I 'm afraid so . I bet you guys could use something hot to drink . I 'd rather have some dry clothes , really . Come on , let 's go inside , see what we can do for you . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) Hot chocolate okay ? Sure . Thanks . JEFFREY : Bogg ! Do you know where we are ? I 'll check the Omni . Don 't bother . New York , 1927 . Roosevelt Field . How do you know ? That 's how I know ! BOGG : Nice little plane . Nice little plane , huh ? Yeah . Bogg , that 's the Spirit of St. Louis . That 's only the most famous airplane in all of history . Oh . Well , maybe something 's wrong with it . Red light ? Red light . Thanks to you guys , my mother was able to get away from this circus . Those reporters don 't know how they might scare somebody with their stupid questions . Anything for a story . And if there isn 't a story , they just go ahead and make one up anyway . LANE : Look , Slim , you better get used to reporters , they 're never going to let you alone . BLYTHE : Not as long as you 're on the ground , anyway . Well , that 's another good reason I get off the ground , I guess . These are the guys that take good care of me and the airplane . This is Lane , Blythe . I 'd like you to meet ... Don 't tell me . Peter Pan and Tinkerbell . CHARLES : Knock it off . These guys just helped me out of a real mess out there . I 'm Phineas Bogg . This is Jeffrey Jones . Hi . Hi . So , there 's nothing wrong with the plane ? No . Now we 're just trying to finish her up before we get the okay to take off . Listen , there 's some dry clothes over there . I can 't guarantee the fit . And you can stow your gear there , too , if you like . Thanks . MAN ON RADIO ... And that was Laura Sherman you heard , doing My Blue Heaven . But the heavens above New York are far from blue . The gray skies and stormy weather are supposed to stay with us until tomorrow . Listen , fellows , the weather 's going to break . I know it is . It 's going to happen . And soon . ( TELEPHONE RINGING ) Hello . Yeah , hi , Doc . He 's right . It 's gonna break . Doesn 't seem so sure . Yeah , but I 'm sure . Look . May 19th . So ? So , May 20th is the day that Lindbergh flew across the Atlantic . The first solo flight in history . He 's leaving tomorrow morning . Well , everything seems to be on schedule . Yeah . Then why 's the Omni red ? I don 't know . Goodbye , Doc . Hey , let 's knock off for the day . Yeah , we can finish in the morning . But you gotta finish up tonight . Mr. Lindbergh , you 're gonna leave for France at 7 : 00 a.m. Tomorrow morning . Look , kid , this weather is not gonna clear up for quite a while yet . But it 'll be clear by morning . Can 't you call and check ? That was Doc Kimball who just called . He said he 'd call if the forecast changed . So the weather 's changing ? Yeah , sure . Getting worse . Rain and more rain . I can 't stand this waiting around . I feel like I 'm never gonna get off the ground . CHARLES : I give up ! Bogg , he can 't give up . You do something . All right , I 'll take care of him . You better get these two jokers back to work if this plane 's gonna be ready in the morning . Mr. Lindbergh ? Mr. Lindbergh . Hey , wait , you can 't back out now . You know , it 's as if he knew for sure that the weather was going to clear . Well , maybe you should listen to him . I 've been holed up in a hangar for a week , waiting for the weather to break . I 've been waiting and waiting . Gives a man too much time to think . I have a feeling your waiting 's just about over . You sound as sure as Jeffrey . He 's not only sure about the weather . He 's also sure you 're gonna be the first man to fly the Atlantic from New York to Paris . Well , somebody is going to fly that ocean someday . I 'm going to show the world that commercial aviation will work . That airplanes can do more than deliver mail , and do stunts at air shows . Here he is ! Lindy . His names Lindbergh . Mr. Lindbergh . Oh . Mr. Lindbergh , what 's your reaction to this latest delay ? You mean the weather ? Come on , Lindbergh , just tell us what made you decide to back out of your flight ? Nobody 's backed out of anything . What are you talking about ? Word 's out your flight 's been scrubbed . ( WIND HOWLING ) You can 't let him do this . Come on , kid , we can 't stop him . But if he locks it up , the plane won 't be ready in time . I think I know what 's wrong . Wrong ? Bogg , it 's terrible . You gotta make him stop . BOGG : Hey , there 's Bixby . Bixby , what 's going on ? I just talked to the other backers . We all agree . We 're taking back possession of the Spirit . The flight 's off . Why are you doing this ? We just had some bad news . Nungesser and Coli , the French fliers , have disappeared over the Atlantic . Oh , no ! Too many men have already lost their lives trying to cross that ocean . I 'm not going to help finance your death . Well , don 't you think that should be his choice ? Mr. Lindbergh 's enthusiasm has blinded him to the dangers . Oh , now , we always knew it would be dangerous . Now with storms not only over New York but Europe , it 'd be suicidal . Bogg , it was Lindbergh 's weatherman who told him that the storms were clearing all across the Atlantic . Is that the Doc Kimball they were talking about ? I think so . Mr. Bixby , if Doc Kimball says the weather 's safe here and in France , then will you give your okay ? I 've already talked to Doc . He said he can 't be sure of anything at this point . Nobody can predict when this weather will pass . Especially all the way over in Europe . But I 've flown through storms plenty of times . No . We 're not taking off until Doc gives the okay . Maybe later in the day tomorrow . Bixby , you know there are two fliers waiting to get off the ground . By then they could have taken off already . Until Doc Kimball says there 's good weather from New York to Paris , no flight . If I wait for good weather all the way to Europe , I could be the last one to leave . I 'm sorry , Slim . BLYTHE : I 'm glad we decided to drive into New York . Have some dinner , take in a play . Not just any play . Rio Rita , and from backstage . Yeah . Helps to have friends in the theater . Yes , it ought to be great fun . You know , you ought to be back in the hangar getting some sleep . I can sleep in tomorrow morning . But you 're gonna be taking off in less than 12 hours . Jeffrey . Bogg , I 'm absolutely sure . You heard Bixby . No takeoff till he hears from Doc Kimball about the weather for sure . Maybe we can call Doc Kimball . We don 't need to call Doc Kimball for a weather report . He 'd call us or Bixby if the forecast changed . We 're gonna be late for the play . The way the forecasts have been ... No . Jeffrey , you and I need to learn when to give up . But we can 't give up ! Bogg , please ? You 've got nothing to lose in checking . Lane , pull up there by the diner , would you ? Look , Slim , you 're gonna disregard the weather reports , your friends , your backers , and listen to a kid ? Yeah . Yeah , I know it 's late . I know it looks pretty bad out there . Whoa ! Doc , slow down , what is it ? The weather 's clearing out of France ? ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) What about over here ? Yeah ! Yeah ! The storm 's finally breaking ! The low-pressure area over Newfoundland is receding and a big high is pushing in behind it all across the North Atlantic . Highs , lows ? What 's it all mean , Doc ? It means that the fog is lifting over most reporting stations between New York and Newfoundland . But it 's still bad out there . No , if there 's a low ceiling over New York , that 's all right , I 'll be flying right over that . What about the storms off the French coast ? It will be a sunny day . Just perfect for a stroll along the Seine . Okay , Lindbergh , you can take off tomorrow sometime . It 's gotta be first thing in the morning . I 've got to cross Ireland before nightfall , otherwise I can 't be sure I 'm on the right course . But you need rest . You can 't fly over 30 hours without a good night 's sleep . There 's no time . We 've got to work all night on the plane . Charles , there 's something I 've got to tell you . Later . We barely have enough time as it is . It 's going to take hours just to load the gasoline . But that 's what we have to talk about . Hey , kid . You did good , convincing Lindbergh to call the Doc that one last time . Green light ? BOGG : Omni is flashing red . I can 't think of anything else that could be wrong . CHARLES : You canceled the gasoline delivery ? I didn 't cancel it . I 've got the receipt right here . It 's all paid for . I just postponed delivery . CHARLES : Postponed it for how long ? Tomorrow sometime . It 's all loaded and ready to go . So , first thing in the morning . Tomorrow morning 's too late ! Can 't you tell the gasoline company to rush the delivery right over ? It 's way past closing . There 's no one there this time of night . Do you have a receipt ? Yes . Well , then the gasoline is really yours , right ? That 's right . Well , if they can 't deliver it , I 'll go over and pick it up . There 's the address . Be careful . They got a guard dog . No problem . Bogg , wait . Remember , animals can smell fear . Jeffrey , in case you haven 't noticed , I happen to have a way with women , children and animals . I give you two out of three . Don 't worry , I 'll have that pooch eating right out of my hand . ( SNARLING ) Let go . I 've dealt with your kind before , you know . I 've always lost . That a boy . Good dog . Now , I know what you 're thinking . A stranger , me , climbs over your fence here and drops , without warning , and into your territory . It looks kind of bad , huh ? Well , I 'm not a thief . Honest . In fact , I have a receipt . ( BARKING ) Brought this with me . See , paid in full . ( NERVOUS LAUGHTER ) You know any tricks ? Can you roll over ? Okay . I don 't know any , either . Okay , I 've tried to reason with you . But your mind 's made up . So I guess I 'll just have to make my move . You know , I 've always had a soft place in my heart for you guys in the animal kingdom . In fact , you know the story about Androcles and the Lion ? Well , who do you think really pulled the thorn out of the lion 's paw ? Androcles ? Uh-uh . Me . And Man o ' War , the race horse . Well , I once saved his tail . And there was this calf once ... Uh-oh . Sorry , dog . I hope you don 't lose your job . ( CRASHING ) He 's been gone for over an hour . Slim , if he doesn 't get here soon , we 're just gonna have to give it up . He 'll be here ! Even if he was here , it would be tough to load all 450 gallons of that fuel . If Bogg can get the fuel this far , I guarantee you guys will find a way to load it up . What 's this ? A change of clothes . You can 't land in France looking like a slob . I 'm not looking to win best-dressed . My flight suit will be fine . No , these are too heavy . I 'm going to wear the ones I 've got . Slim , you gotta have sturdy boots . I 'm flying to Paris . I 'm not walking . I told you guys , no parachute . It 's too heavy . Yeah , well , this just might save that stubborn neck of yours . It weighs about 20 pounds . I 'd rather have 20 pounds of fuel . Okay , let 's see . A quart of water and five sandwiches . Is that all you 're taking to eat ? Well , if I get to Paris I won 't need any more . And if I don 't make it to Paris , I won 't need any more either . He 'll make it . BOGG : Hi ! What 's everybody standing around for ? I got a truck full of gas outside that needs unloading . Bogg , you did it ! Piece of cake . But how did you do it ? Who cares how he did it . Now , come on , Bixby . You 're gonna help me unload this fuel . I 'm gonna get these banker 's hands dirty before I take off for France . Piece of cake , huh ? Well , they 're calling it a solo flight , but I wouldn 't even make it without the help of all of you guys . Good luck to you . A flier doesn 't need luck with weather charts as good as yours , Doc . Goodbye , Slim . Not goodbye . You , and all my other friends from St. Louis , you 're going with me . Mr. Bogg . If you hadn 't gotten that gasoline , the Spirit of St. Louis wouldn 't be taking off right now . It 's okay . It 's my pleasure . Your receipt . There may be a few extra charges there . But the gas was paid for . Yeah . But the fence wasn 't . Well , Jeff , almost time . If you hadn 't talked me into checking with Doc , I wouldn 't be making this flight at all . What 's wrong ? It 's just that this is a real dangerous flight . I guess I 'm scared . Me , too . Yeah ? Yeah . But I can 't let that stop me . Sometimes you just gotta fight through being scared and do what 's got to be done . I was scared a lot of the time when I was flying the mail . I felt like turning back , giving up . I mean , after all , what could be so important about a five-pound mail pouch . Then you start to think about the folks waiting for that mail . Parents waiting for a letter from their kids . Farmer waiting for word from the bank . And you realize people you never met , people you 're never gonna meet , they 're counting on you . So you just got to buckle down , and ... Bite the bullet . That 's it . Slim ! Time to go . Okay ! Okay , guys ! Lets roll her out ! Be careful . Don 't worry about me . I 'm just gonna follow the arrow pointing east all the way to France . I can 't miss . Let 's go . BLYTHE : I don 't know , Lane . That plane is awful heavy with fuel . You think he 'll get off the ground okay ? LANE : He 'll make it . Guess there 's no turning back now , Bogg . JEFFREY : Bogg , the plane 's too heavy . He 's not going fast enough . Bogg , he 's not gonna make it . No , he 'll make it . Up ! Up ! We 'll make it . BOGG : He 's off the ground . Now all he has to do is make it over those wires and trees . He made it ! He 'll make it . I knew it all along . Bogg , can we go watch him land ? England . No , he landed in France . I know . Gay Paris is going to have to wait . Robin Hood needs us back in Merry Old England . ( WIND WHISTLING ) Hope Lindbergh had a softer landing . Me , too . Hey , Bogg , look . There 's Robin . Robin ! How are you ? Very fit , thanks to you . What happened ? Well , we got away . It just took us a little while to get back . Well , you 're a pleasant sight . Two less people I have to worry about . And you 've got my bow . Where did you get such strange costumes ? Believe me , it 's a long story . We 're going to rescue Lady Marian . JOHN : There 's to be an archery contest today . It 's part of the celebration for the Sheriff 's marriage to Marian . Where are the rest of your men ? Well , they were supposed to meet us here by the falls . I had word that they were on their way . But we can 't wait for them any longer . Marian is to be married today . But you said yourself that three men didn 't have a chance . Yeah , you 're walking right into a trap . Maybe so . But it 's a chance I have to take . Then I 'm coming with you . I was hoping you 'd say that . I can use a man like you . We 'll do something about your clothes . I 'm coming , too . No way . This is a suicide mission . JEFFREY : But ... No buts . Remember what happened last time you didn 't listen to me . I need you to stay behind , Jeffrey . My men may return while I 'm gone . Someone has to tell them where we are . Okay , I 'll stay . Good lad . Be careful . Don 't worry . Piece of cake . Sure . For a suicide mission . ( SIGHS ) Good shot . You 're starting to get the hang of it . Do you think I 'm good enough to win the contest ? No . And I 'm not too sure about this plan of yours . You got a better one ? A splendid day for a capture . Don 't you think , Your Grace ? Better day for a hanging . Clever disguise our Robin Hood has on . He could have at least used a different bow . He 's making it much too easy for us . Here comes your lovely bride-to-be . My dear Marian . You look beautiful . I wish I could return the compliment . If only your angelic face did not house the tongue of a witch . Touch me again and I 'll stick a pin through your hand . She 's warming to me , Your Grace . SHERIFF : A week ago , she would have threatened to cut it off . She 'll change her tune when she sees her true love 's neck stretched at the end of a rope . What do you mean ? Why , Robin , of course . We have him . Robin ? He 's here ? Take a look at the second archer down there . PRINCE JOHN : Look familiar ? Perhaps his bow . Robin ! Keep your eye on where you 're shooting . You just hit the wrong target . All this talk of his great archery skill was much exaggerated . As were his exploits . He 's nothing but a common thief . If he were only that , you wouldn 't be going to so much trouble to kill him . He 's a hero to anyone who cherishes freedom and liberty . In case you haven 't noticed , the guards are starting to move in on us . I noticed . But we can 't do anything . Marian is still on the balcony . If Robin doesn 't make his move quick , we 're gonna all end up with our necks stretched . Aye . I think it 's time I dropped in on this little group . PRINCE JOHN : It can 't be ! MARIAN : Robin ! All right ! Good shot , lad . I 'll help Tuck with the horses . Robin ! Marian , go ! But ... But this can 't be ! You 're supposed to be down there . ( ROBIN LAUGHING ) ( GRUNTING ) Guards ! Robin is taking Maid Marian . Stop him ! SHERIFF : Guards . Guards ! Get him ! Robin , watch out ! SHERIFF : Get him , you fools ! Come on , men ! Fight ! Fight ! PRINCE JOHN : Yes , do something ! Prince John should recruit some better fighters . These are terrible . Why can 't they take them ? Surely they can 't overpower our men . PRINCE JOHN : Don 't let them escape . Come on , Robin . Come , Marian . JOHN : Tuck , bring the horses . Get them ! SHERIFF : Guards , move in ! That ought to stop them . SHERIFF : You imbeciles ! ( YELLING ) MARIAN : Robin , the guards are blocking the gate . JOHN : What are we going to do , Robin ? We 've got them . I 'm open to suggestions . There 's no way out . I think you 're right . We 're finished . Good work , men ! This is a day I 've dreamed of . Take them prisoner ! One more step , Your Grace , and my next arrow will find your heart . It 's the kid . And my men . They 've come back . Just in the nick of time . Way to go , Jeffrey . You wouldn 't kill me . That would be treason . Treason to you . Loyalty to King Richard . Sheriff , do something . The Sheriff is welcome to join you in your fate ! I mean what I say ! Either let Robin and the others go free , or you both will die . Let them go . All of them . Thanks for the hospitality , Your Grace , it 's been a wonderful day . And if you 're ever in Sherwood Forest , do come pay us a visit . I 'm sure Friar Tuck would like to give you a dish of nice crow . Blunderer . ( PLANE ENGINE ROARING ) ( WIND WHISTLING ) Date ? May 21 , 1927 . France ? France . Green light . Lindbergh should be here by now . ( CROWD CHEERING ) He did it , Bogg . That guy 's a voyager in his own time . ( CROWD CHEERING ) Come on . Hey ! Whoa , whoa , whoa . How are you gonna explain to him how we got here first ? Right . Hey , and anyway , there 's other great things to see in Paris . The Moulin Rouge . The Louvre . The Folies-Bergère . The Eiffel Tower . Kid , I can 't wait till you grow up . JEFFREY ... If you want to learn more about the legend of Robin Hood or Charles Lindbergh , take a voyage down to your public library .

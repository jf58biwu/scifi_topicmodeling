 Tell me a story , Mr. Hawke . Tell me about Firestorm . Next , on Airwolf . Don 't leave me ! Easy , Eddie , easy . You remember I told you about the light ? Well , this time it came back . Can 't imagine anything being out here we don 't know about . Something 's throwing out interference . Get down ! Hold on . Mother of God ! Hey , there 's nothing wrong with this chopper . It 's got no pep , no pizzazz , I 'm telling you , it 's got no beans . Well , it 's not Airwolf , but that 's not your problem . That 's the subject we should be discussing . Any piece of machinery gets rusty unless you use it . Dom , that 's a very special piece of machinery . You don 't just taxi it around . Regular maintenance flights , that 's all I 'm proposing . You 're incurable . I miss my baby . What the hell do you do with a man who falls in love with a machine ? Hey , String . Ev , how you doing ? Good timing . You just got a call , Mr. Santini . - Angie , down at Four Corners . - Oh , thanks , Ev . You got it . Keep me company ? Mother Santini . I swear , you 're gonna qualify for sainthood . They are out there , and nobody listens . Nobody listens ! There 's something going on , there 's lights , and don 't nobody say different . You 're gonna be damn straight about that . Nothing gets past me . Instead of the shot , Eddie , how about a sandwich ? I make a mean ham on rye . What are you looking at ? Hey , you think I 'm maybe crazy or something , is that right ? What , are you deaf ? Hey , I 'm just minding my own business , okay ? Eddie , leave it alone . Soldier ? Weekend warrior . I was a soldier . I 'm telling you ... Come on , don 't . Hey , let me pour you another beer . There is something out there in the desert . Lights on at night . Hey , I 'm talking to you ! Okay . Whatever you say . I 'm gonna kill you now ! Hey , stop it ! Come on . Come on , come on , you guys . 3 on 1 . Come on , nice guy . Hey , he picked it , not me . Hey , look , why don 't you guys just sit down and enjoy your drinks . Come on , let 's get some fresh air . Yeah , why 'd you call Laurel and Hardy here ? Eddie , every time you start muttering about UFO 's ... I didn 't say that . I know what 's coming next . All right , all right , come on . You won another war . Let 's go . I don 't need a nursemaid ! Why don 't you guys get lost ? I 'll follow you . Follow yourself . I 'll be fine . If I need a ride I 'll phone one of my friends from Mars . Look , you 're not gonna get behind that wheel . - Give me those . - Come on . Now , look , I 'm your friend , but you want me to break your arm to prove it ? Now , come on , get in there . Come on , Eddie , let 's go . There you go . Dominic , how many times has it been that you put me to bed ? How many times have you promised to give up ? You just think I 'm a drunk with the DTs . But I ... I 'm not a lush that sees bugs , I see things in the desert . Yeah , the only monster is the bottle from outer space . I see things in the desert at night . Sure you do , Eddie . Sure you do . You making this a life 's work ? Believe it or not , under all that booze is a good man . Or once upon a time , he was . Yeah , once upon a time . Of course , you and I are perfect . Of course . Bottoms up . Oh , baby . Oh , no . No ! Stop ! Go away ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Get out ! You look like hell , you know that ? I didn 't wanna show up my friends . I just thought I 'd drop by to see if you needed anything . Couple of magazines here and ... Thanks a lot , Dominic . I 'm sorry I can 't shake your hand . You know , the booze had worn off by the time they found you . And still , you were yelling that snakes were crawling all over your body ... Yeah , Dom , I know the story . You gotta get rid of that habit . You gotta knock it off , or you 're gonna die . You gotta quit , Ed . Maybe this time I 'll dream of dancing girls . What the hell 's the use ? You wanna commit suicide , go ahead . Last night you fell in a ditch . Maybe next time you 'll hit your hard head just a little bit harder ... Hey Dominic , I wanna thank you . Thank you very much . Oh , it 's nothing . I just want to know if I can do anything for you . Uh-uh , no . Just get well , will ya ? Get well , you dumb donkey . Dominic . Dominic , I didn 't fall in a ditch . That is not what happened . There was this thing . - Come on , come on . - Dominic . You gotta calm down , will you ? - I swear to God , you ... - Eddie . - I swear to God . You gotta listen to me . - Calm down . - You gotta listen to me , Dominic . - Calm down . You remember I told you about the light ? Well , this time it came back . And not far this time . It came for me . Easy , Eddie , easy . It was blinding me . And the sound , the sound was so bad . I felt like my head was gonna crack open from the pain ! - You gotta believe me ! - Call Dr. Fredrickson . - I believe you . - You don 't believe me . - I believe you . - Dominic , don 't leave me ! - Sir , please . - All right , all right . - I believe you , Eddie . - I felt it inside of me ! Dominic , you gotta believe it was nothing like this earth . I swear to it ! You gotta believe me ! Dominic , it 's like nothing on this earth , I swear to you . Come on , Dom . Eddie 's a nice guy , I like him too , but he 's a drunk . I mean , who knows what he sees . Pink elephants ? Well , if he says he saw something , then I say we ought to check that something out , as a favor to me . You know , when he first started talking about these things he was seeing in the desert , you drove out there . And what did you find ? Nothin ' . That 's a big desert , String . There 's miles and miles of miles and miles , you know that . And if you 're gonna take a look around there 's only one way to cover that kind of country . You 're incurable . I miss our baby . Hey , wait for me . Ready ? Ready . I don 't see much out there but cactus . An old abandoned mine . We 're just spitting distance from the lair . I can 't imagine anything being out there we don 't know about . Yeah , the scope 's out , like something 's throwing out interference . What did I tell you about maintenance ? Especially with this little lady . She 's a prototype of which there ain 't any other . Parts break down , you know . Well , then we 'll run video . Just like they did back in your day . Stick it in your hat . Run infrared , thermal , and standard . Infrared , thermal , and standard . We 're approaching the mining camp . Let 's start taking pictures . You know , all anybody sees now in him is an old rummy , but Eddie Donahough was one of the best pilots I ever saw . There was a crash and a lot of people were hurt . It was a mechanical malfunction , but go tell Eddie about the screams . The doctors managed to put everything back together again . Everything but his nerve . He tried to fly again , but he couldn 't . After a while , all he wanted to do was disappear . What are you gonna do about it ? I don 't know . I suppose when I pick him up at the hospital tonight I 'll give him lecture number 111 . Good luck . Yeah , that should get us a good look . I appreciate it , String . Let 's head home and see what we got . Dom , I want you to know I really appreciate this . I don 't wanna hear that . All I want to hear is that you 're getting ' well . - Yeah . - You know , it doesn 't mean you can ... - You hear what I 'm tellin ' ya ? - Yeah , yeah . Yes . Don 't give me the " Yeah , yeah , yes , yes . " Other people have beaten this ! You can , too , if you just get rid of the stuff . Then you won 't see monsters out there anymore . Well , good night and thanks a lot , Dom . Okay . Now I 'm not so crazy , huh ? I 'm not so crazy , huh ? You see , I told you ! Get down ! Hey , Ev , you know where Dom 's hiding ? No . I was looking for him myself , earlier . I know last night he was headed down to Eddie 's place . Say , listen , if you see him tell him I need authorization for these new parts . Yeah , I 'll tell him . Hold it right there ! You 're trespassing ! Get in the jeep . Dr. Grays to the launch pad . Dr. Grays to the launch pad . All crews , please notify your Section Chief before leaving the compound . I repeat , all crews , check in with your Section Chiefs before leaving . All coordinates confirmed , General . What do you want here , Mr. Hawke ? You know me ? Let 's say we make it our business to know who 's who in the neighborhood . Now , what do you want here ? You 've got a friend of mine here . Tell me a story , Mr. Hawke . Tell me about Firestorm . Firestorm , Mr. Hawke . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Bamboo shoots under the fingernails are pass√© . But in a few moments you will tell me all I want to know about Firestorm , or about Stringfellow Hawke , or anything else I want to know . I ... I think I know you . Tell me a story , Mr. Hawke . Tell me about Firestorm . Tell me a story , Mr. Hawke . Tell me about Firestorm . Talk to me , come on . I don 't know . Your friend Eddie liked to talk about lights in the desert , didn 't he ? Eddie , Eddie 's a drunk . A resilient drunk . A drunk with a voice . We thought we 'd killed him . What did he tell you ? Lights were out of this world . Any more could kill him . Firestorm , Mr. Hawke . What did your friend see ? What does he know ? Did you tell anyone else ? Who will be following you here ? Firestorm . Are you still with us , Mr. Hawke ? America is on fire , from within and without . It 's a firestorm , and make no mistake , it will engulf us all . You 're Sand ... The enemy is winning the war from within . They 've subverted our media , our youth . The time is now or never for a surgical first strike . Guy scares me to death . Sandhower . Talk to me , Mr. Hawke . What is your connection with the intelligence community ? General Sandhower . It 's now " Mister . " . Mr. Sandhower , you have been relieved as a General of the Army because of your extreme views . All I will say is God bless America . And God help her . Will you now retire to private life , sir ? I will serve my country , my way . I 'm a soldier . And I 'll save you once more . You 're him . I 'll make one final statement . Day by day America plays the peacemaker , while the enemy grows stronger . Now , ultimately , where do you think this will lead ? I will tell you . To a ... Firestorm . You 're Sandhower . Tell me a story , Mr. Hawke . Get up . Walk around . It takes a while to wear off . All crews , please notify your Section Chief before leaving the compound . I repeat , All crews , check in with your Section Chiefs before leaving . Am I the guy who said you were seeing pink elephants ? All is forgiven . Now what ? Anybody know you 're here ? Well , I couldn 't go show the pictures around we took from Airwolf . That guy Sandhower is crazy . He may seem crazy , but he knows what he 's doing . Did they bring you past a missile on the way in ? Would you believe it 's nuclear armed ? And they 're getting ready to fire it , at Moscow , no less . A tactical first strike . World War III . You got it . Dr. Anderson , to the launch pad . Dr. Anderson , to the launch pad . Is that the only guard ? Yeah , and he 's armed . Boy , I need a straightener . I need a drink ! You and your damn drunken friend . Hey , lay off ! Your friend 's a lousy lush . Cut it out , in there ! Who are you calling a lush ? Your drunken friend is gonna get us killed ! Drunken old fart . - Okay . - Freeze ! - Thanks . - You take that jeep . I 'll give you cover . Stop them . Stop them ! Stop them ! Get out of the way ! String ! Set for launch ! But you said you were going to alert the media . They 'll know it soon enough . But we have to explain . We have a purpose . Alert the launch crew . I said hurry , eject this ! Get outta here . I 'll pick you up at the trailer . Get outta here ! Go on , go on ! Disconnect the umbilical lines . Make ready to launch . Attention , stand by for countdown . Repeat , stand by for countdown . We made it ! Dom , we made it ! We made it ! Dom ? Dom , you okay ? Dom , you all right ? - Can you get me inside ? - Sure , sure , sure . Put your leg there . Come on . The other leg , come on . Easy does it . We made it , baby . Put your arm up here . Take it easy . Just easy . Yeah , thanks . Mercy General 's on its way . Now , let 's improvise a little first aid here . Eddie , no booze . No lectures , Dom , we have been through one hell of an afternoon of activity , pal . Eddie , just sit down and shut up and listen . I 'm listening , I 'm listening . Eddie , if String got away , he 's gone for help . You think they 'll get there in time ? There 's no " they . " You and him are gonna have to get rid of that madman yourselves . Me ? Hey Dom , me ? He can 't do it alone . Dom , look at me . You 're gonna have to help him fly , Eddie . Fly ? No way . No way . It 's only a chopper , sort of . Here they come . They 're coming after us . You 've gotta help . We 've gotta get outta here . - Here , come on . - Help me . - Put your hand ... - Help me up . My shoulder , here . Going out here . Come on . - No , no . Put me down . - Easy now . Never seen anything like it . Dom , you okay ? - Did you call for help ? - Yeah , and they 're on their way . Meet your new copilot . What are you talking about , Dom ? I can 't fly that plane . I 'm sorry , I can 't help you , but I 'd probably be unconscious when you needed me . I can 't fly that . I haven 't flown in 10 years . What 're you saying , Dominic ? Hey , you 've seen what 's going on out there . We got one chance in a million to stop them . If I go alone , we got none . You just do what I say . Dom , I can 't go . Eddie , you 've always kept crying that you wanted to turn it around if I hung in there with you . But now , now 's your chance . Go on , turn it around . Go on , boy . I can 't . I can 't do it . Oh , forget it . All right . All right , I 'll go . Hold on . Mother of God ! 3 minutes and counting down . Unidentified aircraft approaching . Approximately 18 miles out , speed Mach 1-plus . That fast , it 's military . They got the word out . No matter . We have Air Defense Systems . Now 's the time to use them . Go ! Launch as scheduled . 2 minutes and 30 , counting down . Can 't count on me . It 's flying too fast . Listen , I can fly this bird all by myself . I just need you to bring the weapons on line . Anyone who depends on a drunk is a fool . Unless you gotta count on that drunk to save millions of lives . Buddy , you 're it . Rockets . Rockets ! We 'll be killed . The panel on the right , It says " sunburst . " Pop one now . On the right . What ? On the right , it says " sunburst , " give me one . Give me another one . I thought we were goners . It 's no time to celebrate yet . What is it ? They 've got ignition . I 'm gonna lock on . Gotta get it while it 's on the ground . Bring up a Falcon . That panel , right in front of you , you remember ? Right . Fire . We have liftoff ! We did it . We sure did , Eddie . Yes , we sure did . Government spokesmen today confirmed reports about the nuclear test in the remote Crystal Sands desert basin . It is stressed that the test was routine in nature and did not constitute any shift in administration policy . In other news from Washington , your taxes are going up ... Well , Eddie , here you are . Well , guys , it was a great experience . But the next time you go , don 't call me , I 'll call you . Oh , you loved it . Yeah , you did good , Eddie . Present and accounted for . I got to admit I felt pretty good in that machine . You know , it 'd be probably the best not to mention the machine . I understand . Now , you dumb donkey , you know what it is to get it all together ? I 'm gonna be trying . Trying ? I 'm gonna take this one good wing and I 'm gonna ... Uh-uh , we wouldn 't want that would we ? See ya . Eddie , I forgot to tell you , we 're gonna ... Eddie , nobody can live your life for you . You have to figure it out for yourself . When you do , call me .

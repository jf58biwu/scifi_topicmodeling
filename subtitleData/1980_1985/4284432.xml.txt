 What 's that ? MAN : Some kind of iron horse . MacArthur 's in grave danger . If you 're not out of my sight in 10 seconds , I 'll lock you both in the brig . The Japanese are going to attack Pearl Harbor . Is this a prank call ? A lot of people on that base are going to get killed , and I don 't want you to be one of them . ( MACHINE GUNS FIRING ) Bogg , look , it 's MacArthur ! BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! ( MISSILE WHISTLING ) ( WIND WHISTLING ) ( BOTH GRUNTING ) I have a funny feeling this isn 't a resort . Not with all this noise and lousy weather . ( BEEPING ) Leyte Island , the Philippines , 1944 . World War II . This is great ! Great ? You 're getting a little warped , kid . No war is great . ( ENGINE FALTERING ) That guy 's in trouble , and I 'm going after him . You stay put . Fat chance . Banzai ! ( GRUNTING ) Hey , hold it . You okay ? Yeah . Who are you guys ? How come you 're not in uniform ? We 're with the USO . USO ? Here ? What we need are reinforcements . We 're getting the heck beat out of us . But in 1944 , America 's supposed to be winning on Leyte Island . Tell them that . But what about MacArthur ? He led the attack on this island that totally totaled the enemy . MacArthur died over two years ago at the attack on Pearl Harbor . Pearl Harbor ! Yeah , he was there for some top secret meeting . Listen , I got a lot of wounded waiting for this medicine . Well , these guys won 't mind if we take their car . Hey , now you 're talking . They 're not gonna shoot at one of their own . What are you gonna do with these devils ? Don 't you worry about that . Just get that medicine to the wounded . Thanks a lot . Bogg , MacArthur wasn 't in Pearl Harbor during the attack . He was in the Philippines . BOGG : Wrong history , that 's why we got a red light . Without MacArthur , America could lose the South Pacific . SOLDIER : Thanks , guys . Good luck . ( BEEPING ) Okay , kid , date ? Well , we should get there the day before the attack , December 6th , 1941 . Sayonara , guys . ( WIND WHISTLING ) ( BEEPING ) December 6th , 1941 . Pearl Harbor . Right on target . Tomorrow , that 'll be a bad joke . Schofield Barracks ? You sure you have the right date ? No one here looks very concerned . That 's because no one knows what 's gonna happen except us and the Japanese . All these people have no idea that tomorrow the world is gonna change . Well , if MacArthur 's here for a secret meeting , nobody 's gonna know except the top brass . We 'd better find the base commander . Right . Excuse us , could you tell us where we could find one of the base commanders ? How am I supposed to know ? This is an Army base . I 'm in the Navy . Yeah , we 're just here for the big battle tonight . You know about the battle ? Yeah . Who you rooting for ? Rooting for ? The Americans , who else ? Well , sure , we 're all Americans . Listen , we 've got the hottest trumpet player this side of the mainland but the Army , they 've got a mean man on the skins . What are you talking about ? What do you think , silly ? The Battle of the Bands . Isn 't that why you 're in costume ? Oh , yeah , yeah , sure , that 's why we 're in costume . Well , listen , we 've got to take a powder . Tina and me are in the dance contest tonight , and we got to rest up . Listen , I hope we see you there . It 's gonna be hot . Yeah , good luck . See you . How come we 're not wearing costumes ? I didn 't know we were supposed to . Why did you give me this assignment ? JACK : Well , it 's what you 've been bugging me for , isn 't it ? Yeah , but not this kind . Look , the officer of the day is very busy with last minute details for MacArthur 's meeting with the fleet captains . Now somebody had to fill in . And since it 's a desk job , and I 'm a woman , you figure I can handle it . Well , you can , can 't you ? Yes , but I 've been trained as an intelligence operative . Why don 't I get any of those kind of assignments ? Well , maybe the commander of this post doesn 't think you 're ready . You 're the commander of this post ! That 's right . I 'm as ready as any of your other civilian operatives , and you know it . Now why are you holding me back ? Holding you back ? Listen , young lady , it 's time you faced the truth . You 've only gotten as far as you have because I 'm your father . That 's not true . I 've worked harder than anybody for this position . Working hard is not enough . Because I 'm a woman . Yes . But , look , I know that 's not fair , but that 's the way the government is . And that 's the way the world is . You have to do better than the men . You can 't make a mistake and you can 't break down , because when you do , they 're gonna be waiting to nail you . I can handle that . I can do the job . Well , then prove it . How can I when I 'm sitting behind this desk ? Look , it 's like I said , no matter what the job , you have to do better . Now don 't forget , we have dinner with General MacArthur at 2000 hours . That 's 8 : 00 ... That 's 8 : 00 p.m. Yes . Sure , that assignment I can handle . Bogg , we came here to find MacArthur , not the Battle of the Bands . Right . Those MPs ought to know where we can find him . Come on . Hey , you guys , excuse me . Do you know where we can find a commander ? You wanna see a commander ? Yes , sir . Yeah , we have something really important to discuss with him . ( SCOFFS ) Don 't tell me . Your pirate ship captured one of our cruisers . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) Look , guys , we 're not kidding around . This is very important . How about showing us your IDs ? IDs ? IDs . Must 've left it in my other uniform . I could lock you in the stockade for that . Hey , look , can you just take us to one of the commanders ? Commanders are very busy men . Send in your request for a meeting , and they 'll see you in about a month . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) We need to talk to a commander about MacArthur . I think you got their attention . Wait , what are we doing here ? We have to see the commander . First you see the officer of the day . Then you see a commander . Keep an eye on them , Tom . You know how pirates are . Miss Knox , where is the officer of the day ? He 's busy . I was left in charge . What is it ? Maybe I 'd better get someone else . Sergeant , I was left in charge by my father , the Commander . ( EXHALES ) Yes , ma 'am . We 've got a couple of kooks out there who want to talk to a commander . Kooks ? What kind of kooks ? There 's a man dressed like a pirate and a young boy . And when I asked the young boy his date of birth , he said , " October 3rd , 1970 . " ( LAUGHS ) Well , maybe he 's just having some fun with you . What do they want to see the commander about ? They know MacArthur 's here . They say he 's in great danger . They know about MacArthur ? How ? I don 't know . Do you think it may have leaked out ? It 's impossible ! It 's top secret ! What do you want me to do with them ? Release them . What ? Sergeant , release them . Yes , ma 'am . Release them . What ? It 's an order . Look ... Okay , you two , get out ! Look , we 've got to see the commander . Well , you 're not going to . And if you know what 's good for you , you 'll get off this base . Don 't you understand ? MacArthur is in grave danger . If you 're not out of my sight in 10 seconds , I 'll lock you both in the brig . But MacArthur ... Forget it , we 'll get out of here . ( SIGHS ) What are we going to do ? Look , security is a little loose around here , don 't you think ? Yeah . Well , if MacArthur were here for a secret meeting he 'd be under heavy security , right ? Right . Well , we 're going to find that area . Come on . ( ENGINE RUMBLING ) Getting ready for tonight , huh ? Oh , yeah . You kidding ? I was the jitterbug champ of the Bronx two years in a row . I 'm gonna show these hicks a thing or two . We were wondering , you wouldn 't know of any heavy security area on base , would you ? Sure , Thompson compound . Where is it ? It 's down the beach , about half a mile . Thanks . Hey , you 'll never get in there , especially dressed like that . Bogg , don 't you think we should try to warn the base about the attack ? You can 't change history , kid . Hey , you wanna get some lunch ? We may not get another chance before we reach the security area . I am kind of hungry . You know , Bogg , it is kind of hard not to try . What ? To change history . Oh , yeah , I know . One of the drawbacks of the job . Excuse me . Excuse me . ( EXCLAIMS ) Oh , excuse me . It 's okay . I 'm so clumsy . My pleasure . My souvenirs . You sure do have a lot of them . Well , you know , I 'm from Omaha . Figures . This is my first time in Hawaii . I was with a tour group but I got separated from them somehow . So , now I guess , I 'm kind of lost . Where are you guys from ? Oh , we kind of travel all over . Yeah ? Yeah . My name 's Jackie . Phineas Bogg . Hi . This is Jeffrey Jones . Hi . Hi . Will you two look at that background ? Would you mind if I got a shot of you for the folks back in Omaha ? They 're gonna love this . Excuse me , could you get out of my way ? Thank you . Bogg , we have things to do . Excuse me , Jackie , we kind of have someplace to go . Oh , sure . I don 't want to impose . Oh , no . You 're not imposing . It 's just the kid was hungry , and we thought we 'd get some lunch . Lunch ! Great . I 'm starving . Way to go , ace . JACKIE : Just one more shot with the pineapple . Oh , that 's wonderful . That 's her fifth roll of film . Don 't complain . She bought lunch , didn 't she ? Big deal . The whole thing cost 15 cents . Whoever heard of eating a hot dog with pineapple on it anyway ? You know , Bogg , we 're never gonna be able to sneak on the base with her tagging along . Don 't worry , I got it all figured out . ( GROANS ) Hey , guys ... Hold it , there . That 's a great shot . This lady is unreal . Don 't be long . The coast is clear . Come on . Come on , let 's get out of here . Okay , kid , that 's where we 've got to go . And there 's our ticket in . Come on . I gotta hand it to you , Bogg , this is a great idea . I have my moments . Hey , fellows , what are you doing in the back of the truck ? How did she find us ? I think she 's part bloodhound . So much for sneaking in . Where were you guys going in there ? Just hitching a ride . You could 've got us in a lot of trouble , you know . Oh , jeez , Phineas , I 'm sorry . It 's just that I thought we must 've missed each other when I went to get another roll of film . Look , lady , we didn 't miss you , we left you on purpose . Hey , Jeff , easy . She 's all alone . Is that true , Phineas ? No ! We were ... No , that 's all right , you don 't have to explain . I mean , I 've been dumped before by an entire tour group . I know I 'm a pest . No , you 're not . It 's just that we have business to do , you see , dangerous business , and we didn 't want you to get hurt . Hey , she 's got the Omni ! German or Japanese ? Huh ? Neither . Dates , places , even a globe . What is this ? Nothing . Really , you better give that back . Hey , stop that ! Freeze , buster . What is this ? Who are you ? Jackie Knox , Army Intelligence . You 're both under arrest . What ? Since when does Army Intelligence dress like a day at the beach ? I 'm a civilian operative . ( GROANS ) Oh , Jackie , we were having so much fun together before ... From now on , military procedure dictates that you only address me as Miss Knox . Okay . Miss Knox , we were just spending the day at the beach . Oh , sure . That 's what they all say . I knew she was going to be trouble . Okay , are you going to tell me what this device does , or would you rather wait and talk to Colonel Knox ? I thought you were Knox . Right . The Colonel 's my father . Great , then you can take us to him . Who else would I take two captured spies to ? Oh , brother . You know , this looks like some kind of a radio . Wait till my father sees this . Don 't touch the button . Grab her , kid . ( WHOOSHING ) When are you riders ever gonna learn that no one gets through this pass alive . ( WIND WHISTLING ) Sorry about that . Where 'd they come from ? I don 't know , but I don 't want to stay to find out . Jake , come on , let 's get out of here . Let 's go . My horse ! They took my horse . JEFFREY : What 's going on here ? Yeah . That 's what I want to know . This isn 't Hawaii . No kidding . I told you not to touch that button . What 's a Hawaii ? What were all those stars we went through ? It 's called the cosmos . Now give me the Omni ... But wait a minute . Back . Where are we ? How did we get here , and why is everybody dressed funny ? You people lost ? Bogg , we gotta get her back . I know . We gotta get us back . I know . Listen , Jackie , we 're far away from Hawaii , I think . And the only way back is for you to give us that Omni . Negative . Espionage equipment confiscated by Intelligence Personnel becomes the property of the United States Army . Section 54 , Paragraph 3 . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Well , I can 't even tell you where we are without it . Well , I can tell you where we are . You 're in Utah . Utah ? That 's crazy . Yeah , well , you think that one 's crazy . Wait till you hear the next one . What 's the date ? April 10 , 1860 . Who are you ? I 'm Bill Cody . Buffalo Bill ? Give me a break . Buffalo Bill ? Nobody ever called me that before . They will . I 'm a Pony Express rider , and I had to get this medicine to Salt Lake . See , there 's a sick little girl that won 't make it past tomorrow night without it . The Pony Express won 't survive if she doesn 't . What do you mean ? Setting up the Pony Express takes money . No backer is willing to put up his money until somebody proves it 'll work . So far every rider has failed to get through that pass . You see , the little girl 's father , he 's a banker . He knew the stage wouldn 't make it in time so he said he 'd give the company the backing it needs if we could make it . Do you expect me to believe all this ? You think I 'm lying about a sick little girl ? Never mind her . How 's your ankle ? I think it 's broke . I was the company 's last chance . I guess there 's no way I can make it now . Poor kid . We gotta help Bill make that ride . Wait a minute . Do you guys expect me to believe that he 's the Buffalo Bill Cody , and this is really 1860 ? JACKIE : What are you ? Nuts ? You got it . Okay , look , fellows , fun is fun . You say this is 1860 , I say this part of Utah looks the same in 1941 . And for all I know that guy and his friends could just be a bunch of rejects from a Hopalong Cassidy movie . Listen , Jackie , you have to understand . That device you took from us is a time machine . Time machine ? There 's no such thing . That 's what you think . And this is Utah , 1860 . And if you ever want to see Pearl Harbor , 1941 again , either give us back the Omni , or wait around 81 years and take a boat . I don 't believe any of this . Then explain how you got here . It 's some kind of espionage trick . A spell of some kind . Hypnotism or drugs . That 's it , you two have me drugged . Let 's argue about this later , okay ? You don 't mind if we get Bill here to a doctor , do you ? Okay , but no funny business . DOCTOR : Now , listen , you stay off that foot ! ( EXCLAIMS IN DISDUST ) That stuff will kill you . Tobacco , outlaws , what 's the difference ? And I don 't care what that doc says , I only need one good foot in the stirrup . Anyway , that little girl needs her medicine . It 's my responsibility to deliver it . But you 're just a boy . You have to be young and light to ride for the Pony Express , ma 'am . And I 'm not a boy . I do a man 's job . Yeah , you have to be light so you can ride with more speed . And you have to be an orphan , too . Why ? It 's dangerous work . Better off having somebody doing it that nobody cares about . That 's terrible . No , it ain 't , it 's exciting . Well , it 'll be suicide if you try to outrun those outlaws with a bad ankle . I 'll make the ride . No , wait a minute . JEFFREY : No , Bogg , I think I should make the ride . I 'm young , light and an orphan . Well , I don 't know . He 'd have the best chance . You two are forgetting something here . You 're my prisoners . Nobody is going anywhere . What kind of prisoners ? Prisoners of love . Excuse us a moment , would you ? Take your hands off of me . ( LAUGHS ) Prisoners of love . That 's a good one . Sit down ! Look , for once you 're gonna ... For once you 're gonna listen to me . Look around you , will you ? Whether you want to believe it or not , you traveled back through time . This is 1860 . But that 's insanity . Don 't talk , listen . Look , the kid and I travel back through time with that time machine you confiscated from us . And when we land in someplace where something 's wrong , we try to get things back on the right track , like now . ( SIGHS ) I believe you . I know it seems impossible but I 'm starting to believe it . Good . Then you understand why it 's so important for us to try and deliver that medicine . Yes . I understand . What are you crying about ? It 's just that I think I 'm losing my mind . ( LAUGHS ) No , you 're not . I 'm not ? No . I know it seems strange but it 'll all work out , you 'll see . Here . Thanks . You know , I 've always been a sucker for a girl in uniform . I must confess , Phineas , I like you , too . And you don 't think we 're spies anymore ? Oh , I hope not . And you 'll stop holding us prisoners and give us back the Omni . I can 't . What ? I just can 't , Phineas . Training like I 've had is hard to break . Now , I 've gotten myself into this assignment , and I 'm not gonna mess it up , now . Okay , have it your way . You 're still gonna let us make that ride though , aren 't you ? Sure , if I can go with you . ( MEN CHATTERING ) BOGG : There are the horses . You sure these are the outlaws ' horses ? Oh , yeah . The Palomino 's mine . And the others I 'd know anywhere . I knew the riders who died trying to get them through the pass . Well , what the outlaws took we can take back . Let 's go . Tell me , Phineas , what 's it like being a time traveler ? You should know , you just did it . Yeah , but this is my first time . I 'm totally disoriented . So am I , all the time . My clothes are always out of date . I act different , talk different . No matter where I go , I 'm always an outsider . Talk about being an outsider . Try being the only female intelligence operative on a military base . Even my job title may sound important , but all the men see is some little girl . My social life is non-existent . I haven 't even had a date since I started working at that base . Yeah ? Yeah . Well , try getting close to somebody when you spend one day in Rome and the next in Timbuktu or somewhere . Well , if it weren 't for the kid , I think I 'd go crazy . How old were you when you became an orphan ? I was really young . I never knew my parents . I guess it 's better that way . I was 10 . I knew my parents real well . I miss them . Well , at least you know what it 's like to be loved . Something you miss living in an orphanage . There they just wait for you to grow up so they can make room for somebody else . When Mr. Russell from the Pony Express come , said I was just what he was looking for ... That was really something . First time in my life somebody wanted me . I didn 't care how dangerous it was or how much I was getting paid . I was doing something to help somebody , and I 'd do it for nothing . Don 't worry , we 'll get past those outlaws . Not the three of you together , you won 't . The guy 's too big , and that girl , she 's too slow . But I can make it through . You got the right build , and all . What if I snuck away in the morning before they woke up ? Hey , now , you know how dangerous it is . For an orphan ? Piece of cake . Okay . Have you ever thought of quitting ? Sure , lots of times . ( SIGHS ) But I don 't know . This is what I do . It 's what I want to do . I couldn 't quit . I know what you mean . JEFFREY : Shh ! Be quiet . Now remember , keep your head down and whatever you do , don 't slow up . I 'll remember . Tell Bogg I 'll see him in Salt Lake . All right . ( HORSE NICKERING ) Yeah ! Go , boy . Where 's Jeffrey ? Well , he 's on his way to Salt Lake with the medicine . Without me ? Don 't worry , he 'll make it . I 'll make sure he does . Hey , you 're not leaving without me . Here comes another one . Let 's go ! Looks like Sam and Jake scared up another one . Bat 's breath ! Box canyon . ( HORSE NEIGHING ) Kid , you 've just reached the end of the line . Get off your horse . Hurry up ! I 'm going as fast as I can . Now we 're gonna teach you why no one ever gets through this pass . Bogg ! MAN : You two stupid or suicidal ? Boy , am I glad to see you . We 'll talk about this later . Give me the Omni . I 've got a gun , let 's take them on . These guys shoot back . Give me the Omni . MAN : What are you doing ? Posing for a family portrait ? I won 't tell anybody if you won 't . Pearl Harbor , December 7th 1941 . What a relief . Look , it 's Schofield Barracks . It 's nice to be home again . That 's what you think . I wonder what time it is . I think those church bells are for 7 : 30 mass . Bogg , that means we have less than half an hour . We 've got to find MacArthur , pronto . Come on . Hey , where do you guys think you 're going ? You 're still my prisoners . All right , Jackie , stop kidding around . I 'm not kidding . But , Jackie , I thought we ... You and I , what we 've been through ... I can 't believe ... I know , Phineas , I like you , I really do , both of you , but we 're back on base now , and I 've broken , who knows , how many regulations and ... For Pete 's sakes , if I 'm ever gonna prove anything to my father , I 've got to bring you two guys in . I can 't believe ... But I 'm sure that after we explain to him ... But there 's no time for that . Why ? Better tell her . At 7 : 55 this morning the Japanese are going to attack Pearl Harbor . That 's impossible . So is time travel . And unless we do something , MacArthur is going to be killed . Please , Jackie , you have to believe us . Where 's she going ? Wait here . If Jeffrey 's right , we should pick up some blips on the scope . Don 't worry , they 'll be there . There 's got to be something wrong . This is the biggest blip I 've ever seen . That 's what Jeff was trying to tell you . No . It 's got to be a malfunction of some kind . Yeah , or a lot of enemy planes . Well , if they are , there are two waves of them . And they are coming in from the north 57 miles , three degrees east . I 've got to alert the base . ( BUZZING ) Fort Shafter . Private Buck speaking . This is Miss Knox , Army Intelligence . I want to speak with the highest ranking officer in charge . You got him . A private is in charge ? Look , Miss Knox , it 's 7 : 45 in the morning . Everybody 's either asleep or having breakfast . But I 've spotted a mass of planes on the radar scope . I wouldn 't sweat it . We 're expecting a flight of B-17 s in from the mainland . He says they 're expecting B-17 s in . The kid says they 're Japanese . ( MACHINE BEEPS ) Listen carefully , you 've got to alert the base . The Japanese are going to attack Pearl Harbor . Is this a prank call ? I am very serious , Private . Sure , sure , I 'll jot down the information . Sayonara , honey . Hello . Hello . That stupid jerk . Now do you believe us ? I 'd be a fool not to . Look , we 're running out of time . We 've only got 10 minutes left . MacArthur and my father are meeting with the fleet captains at 0800 this morning on the main base . That 's right in the middle of the attack . Come on , let 's go ! You 're staying here . What ? Why ? Because a lot of people on that base are going to get killed , and I don 't want you to be one of them . But I ... No buts . Something happened last night between us , and I don 't want to lose that . You 're staying here where it 's safe . What about you ? What about Jeffrey ? I can watch out for the kid but I can 't watch both of you . Now I 'm locking you in here behind me . Phineas , I work for that base . I belong there . I don 't want to lose what we have either , but you can 't try to protect me . That 's been my problem my whole life . I 've spent so much time being protected that I never had a chance to prove I could take care of myself . Please , Phineas , I 've got to go . Okay , but watch yourself . Please . I can 't . I 'll be too busy watching you . Come on . Bogg ! Bogg , listen , they 're coming . Look ! I hope we don 't get to the base too late . ( MISSILE WHISTLING ) MAN 1 : What 's going on ? What 's all that noise ? MAN 2 : The artillery having target practice ? MAN 3 : Japanese planes ! Hit the deck ! ( AIR RAID ALARM BLARING ) Get down ! Get down ! Take cover ! Take cover ! Bogg , look , it 's MacArthur ! My father ! BOGG : Try and shoot down the Japanese with a.45. What 's that child doing here ? Sergeant , get that child under some cover ! Yes , sir . Bogg ... It 's okay , kid , it 's safer this way . JACK : Jackie , get out of here . This is no place for a woman . Never mind that , are you all right ? BOGG : Help me get your father out from under here . Don 't worry about me . Get the General ! He 's going to get himself killed ! We 'll get him ! Phineas , MacArthur ! No , let me go . Jackie , are you crazy ? Let the man go ! Please , Phineas . Okay . Did you see that ? Did you see what she did ? I knew it all the time . That 's my girl ! Come on , we 've got to get you out of here . Go on ! Go on ! I 'm okay , my leg 's not broken . Come on , let 's get out of here ! ( MACHINE GUNS FIRING ) Thanks again , Jack . I just wanted to tell you how impressed I was with your daughter . You know , General , she impressed me , too . I could use an intelligence operative in the Philippines . Do you think she might be interested ? Interested ? She 'd be delighted . She 's been badgering me for months to give her an important assignment . Good , good , she can start after the first of the year . By the way , where is she ? I 'd like to tell her myself . I believe she 's at the beach with Mr. Bogg , sir . Well then , you tell her , Jack . With your permission , sir , I know someone who 'd really like to tell her . Very well , Sergeant . Jack , see you . Good luck , General . ( OMNI DINGS ) BOGG : Green light . I guess it 's time for the kid and I to get back to Bill Cody . Nobody needs us here anymore . That 's not true . I need you , Phineas . You know , I 've spent so much time trying to prove I could be as good as a man , I missed a lot of life . I never let myself make mistakes , or get hurt , or fall in love . Everything 's changed now . If it makes you feel any better , the feeling 's mutual . A lot of good that does me . It 's bad enough having a sweetheart overseas , I 've got one over the rainbow . You can 't call me from another time zone . And if you ever write to me , it could take me 100 years just to get the letter . Well , that 's one tradition between a man and a woman that should never change . Yeah . Listen , things are gonna get better for you , I know it . I don 't know . You just be careful in Utah . Okay ? I will . Just got to figure a way past them outlaws . Jackie ! MacArthur wants you to go with him to the Philippines . Really ? I heard him say it myself . I told you things were gonna get better . Would you excuse us for a minute , Sergeant ? Yes , ma 'am . You know , Phineas , a motorcycle is a lot faster than a horse . Was thinking the same thing , myself . All right ! Great idea . ( CHUCKLES ) You take care of the big guy , okay ? No problem . Take care of yourself . ( SIGHS ) ( DINGS ) Phineas . I love you . We 'd better cover this thing up pretty well . If somebody finds it , they 'll either pass out or have a head start on the invention of the internal combustion engine . That ought to do it . Come on , let 's find Bill . Hey . Well , what happened ? Outlaws . They got our horses . Well , at least you didn 't get killed . But we still have the medicine , and I think we have a way to get it to Salt Lake by tonight . It 's no use . I tried and you tried , five riders been killed already . I say we just forget we ever heard of the Pony Express . I can always go back to the orphanage . No ! We can do it . And we can . Look , the kid and I found this horse , a very special horse , one that can outrun anything the outlaws have . Yeah ? Yeah . Oh , good . Can I see it ? No , it 's grazing a little ways from here . We need you to do something else . I 'll try . Get together a posse . We tried that . Outlaws just hide up in the hills . No . But this time it 's gonna work . We 're gonna draw the outlaws out of their holes long enough for you to get there with the posse . Heck , I 'll try anything . Then you can ride the rest of the way to Salt Lake . All right , I 'll have a posse together in an hour . BOGG : Any sign of outlaws ? Not yet . This might be easier than I thought . Keep your eyes open , kid . They could come out of anywhere . Now what the heck is that ? You got me . What did you put in those beans last night ? Maybe it 's some kind of train . Not without a track . It looks like it 's gotta be some kind of iron horse . Well , if it is , I 've gotta steal it . Come on . Here they come . Hang on . We got them out of hiding . Now , let 's give them a chase until the posse shows up . JAKE : That iron horse is fast . Bogg , they 're coming . Hang on , it 's going to be a rough ride . BILL : Come on , we 've got to get to them before the outlaws do . They 're catching up , Bogg . What 's that ? Let 's get them . They should be around the next bend . BOGG : Do you see the posse yet ? JEFFREY : No , we 've gotta keep on . They 'd better show up soon . Uh-oh , more company . What 're we gonna do ? Hang on . MAN 1 : Get them ! Get them ! BOGG : I think we 're gonna lose them . MAN 2 : That 's the darndest machine I 've ever seen . ( ENGINE FALTERING ) JEFFREY : Bogg , what 's wrong ? There 's something else that 1860 doesn 't have besides motorcycles . BOTH : Gasoline . Take off the cap and look in the tank . Bogg , look ! It 's too dark in there . I can 't see anything . Bogg , we 're going over a cliff . Jump ! ( GRUNTING ) ( CRASHING ) JEFFREY : That was close . Yeah , and there goes modern transportation . ( SIGHS ) Where 's that iron horse ? Down there . Dad gum it ! I wanted to steal that thing . Hand over your cargo . It 's just medicine . It 's no use to you . It 's gotta be worth something for you to go through all this trouble . Now , hand it over , now ! ( GUN FIRES ) Put your hands up . It 's the last time you boys are gonna block this pass . ( GROANS ) BOGG : Sure glad to see you . Well , you did it , but how ? Where 's that horse you was talking about ? Where she belongs . Someplace it will take her 80 years to come back from . What ? You never mind that . You 've still got a ride to finish . Seeing Mr. Barley 's face when the doc told him his little girl was gonna make it , made all the trouble we went through worth it . Yeah , and the Pony Express came through . Mr. Barley came through , too . This here 's a letter of credit from his bank . It 's enough money to buy the Pony Express everything it needs to get started . I gotta ride back to Missouri right away to deliver it . You fellows want to come along ? No thanks , we 've got things we got to do . I was meaning to ask you , what happened to that girl you all was with ? Oh , she had to go back to where she belongs . That 's too bad . She had something , you know , something real different . Anyway , I gotta go . Thanks again . So long . ( DINGS ) BOGG : What are you doing ? December 31 , 1941 , Hawaii . Hawaii ? Yeah . Yeah , I thought Jackie might need a date for New Year 's Eve . That 's real nice . I 'm gonna show Jackie the most exciting evening she 's ever had in her life . No way , Bogg , two 's company , but three 's a crowd . What are you talking about ? I 'm taking Jackie out New Year 's Eve . What ? Got you ! JEFFREY ... If you wanna learn more about Pearl Harbor or the Pony Express , take a voyage down to your public library . It 's all in books !

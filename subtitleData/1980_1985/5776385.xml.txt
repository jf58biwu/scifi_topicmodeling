 Good evening from the BWC news room . Top of the news this evening is speculation about the real facts behind the Department of Health announcement about a radioactive spill , supposed to have occurred yesterday at the state nuclear plant . Information from an official source , which reached our newsroom this afternoon , stresses the seriousness of the situation , but , at the same time , the prompt action of the emergency team has already contained any damage caused by the accident . - Hi , lovely . - Hi , Miller ... Mr. Desmond 's waiting for you . Go right in . The arrival here , expected at any moment , of Professor Hagenbeck ... Ah , Miller one of the original planners of the nuclear station , will undoubtedly ... enable us to obtain more precise information . You heard ? He 's arriving tomorrow morning at 11 . Take one of the best cameramen with you . Why me in particular ? I want an exhaustive interview which will reassure our viewers . Not just the truth , pure and simple ? Forget the philosophy , Miller . Just do what you 're told . I 'm not used to manipulating news , according to my professional ethics . He hasn 't arrived yet . - Find out what runway they 're landing on . - Ok . Hey , Willy , come over here . - What have you got ? - Unidentified trace . What 's the bearings ? About 30 miles north-east . Altitude approx . 5000 . Control tower here , there 's a trace approaching from the north-east . Distance about ... 30 miles . We 've seen it . Doesn 't seem to fit in with any of our data . We 're trying to identify it now . Try to make contact . Calling aircraft , about 30 miles north-east of Glipswick Tower , identify yourself ... Calling aircraft , about 30 miles north-east of Glipswick Tower , identify yourself , please . Could be their radio isn 't working . It 's a Hercules military transport . That 's strange , it doesn 't have any markings on it . It looks like it 's going to land . He 's coming in on 25 , make sure that runway 's clear , and declare an emergency . Hey , you up there , what are you up to ? - Where are the pilots ? - We 'd better call the police . Hello ! It 's an emergency ! What the hell 's going on ? I don 't know . Let 's see . - What 's the story ? - Nobody answers , sir . In the name of the law , open the door ! I repeat : in the name of the law , open the door ! I repeat : I order you to open the door ! You have just 30 seconds to make up your mind . It 's Professor Hagenbeck . Look out ! Get back ! Stop them ! Aim at their chest ! Shoot , shoot ! No , no ! Oh , my God ! I don 't believe it . It 's absurd ... Let 's go out of here ! Let 's go ! Answer , please . Answer , please . Interrupt the program , we 're transmitting a special newsflash . - Does the chief know about it ? - No time to tell him . Am I in charge of the broadcast ... or not ? Whatever you say , Miller . Your wish is my command . Wake up , Terry . Give your best smile and announce Miller , special newsflash . Ladies and gentlemen , your attention , please . We 're interrupting our transmission of " it 's all music " for a special newsflash . At the end of the newsflash we 'll return with our regular program . Thank you . Oh , shit ! Just as I was going to warm up a little bit . Shut up , I wanna listen to it . At 11 o 'clock this morning ... an event without precedence took place at the airport of this city . An airplane of no nationality landed at the airport , ignoring all instructions from the control tower . The airport police immediately converged on the scene of the unauthorized landing , surrounding the aircraft and ordering its occupants ... - Yes , right away , chief . - ... to come out and identify themselves . The order had absolutely no effect . What the hell are you doing ? Who interrupted my broadcast ? Now , don 't go mad at me , it 's not my fault . The chief rang down . Bastard ! I 'd like to know who was on that plane . They 're UFO 's . It was bound to happen sooner or later . You read too many comic books . You can say what you want , but I 'm not going home tonight . You can sleep at my house . I 'll protect you . Yeah ! And who 's gonna protect me from him ? Will you all shut up ! We 're back on the air in 2 minutes . Come on . Is it possible you aren 't aware of the trouble that broadcast of yours could 've caused , or the uproar that would 've followed it ? I 'm well aware of that , General Murchison , but I 'm a journalist and my job is to keep the public informed . Mr. Miller , listen to me ... very carefully . Something very serious has happened at the airport . But until we conclude our investigation and take the necessary countermeasures , nothing is going to leak out , nothing ! The Defense Department has strictly forbidden it . I don 't give a damn about the Defense Dept . In a democratic country nobody can interfere with the freedom of the press , for any reason whatsoever ! I see . Mr. Desmond , as the person in charge of this station , you will be held directly responsible for the dissemination of any tendentious news . I am sure you realize what you 're risking . Don 't worry , we won 't transmit anything without your authorization . Thank you . Good morning . I 'm fed up with you , Miller . I 'm suspending you from all duties . No , you 're not , I quit ! Ok , I see ... yeah ... Excuse me , honey ... I 'm in a hurry . ' - Hello , Liz . Is my wife there ? She ... she just went out this minute . Call her back , immediately ! Yes , sir , of course . Mrs. Miller ! Mrs. Miller ! I 'm sorry , sir . But I missed her . But you 'll be able to reach her at the hospital in half an hour . She said she wasn 't feeling well today . She was going to stay home . I don 't know . Maybe she changed her mind . Ok , Liz . Thank you . Please , don 't answer . It 'll stop . This is your day off . - Yes . - Major Warren ? - Speaking . This is Civil Defense headquarters . General Murchison would like you to come down here right away . Why ? What 's up ? The General will explain everything to you himself . Come right over . The drill is maximum urgency . Sorry . We 'll finish our " conversation " later . What 's wrong ? You don 't like it . No , to the contrary . But every time I look at it I get a feeling of ... Of death . Is that what you were going to say ? Maybe ... It 's the first time one of your works has given me a feeling like that . It 's funny , but it 's like that . I cannot say that you are wrong . When I look at it objectively , I mean ... when I 'm not actually working on it ... I almost get the feeling I wasn 't the one who made it . But some other being outside of me . That sounds like science-fiction . Metapsychics , if you want . It 's better we don 't take it so seriously . I 'll junk it if you want . No ... don 't even think of it . Can you imagine what the world would have lost had Michelangelo destroyed his works at the request of Major Warren ? I 'm not Michelangelo . To me , you are much more ... Wake up , Major , if not , you 're never going to get to work ... Camera 1 , zoom out to her waist ... On 2 , hit it ! What 's happening ? Help ! Oh , my God , get us out of here ! What the hell 's going on down there ? ! I don 't understand ... Help ! Civil Defense , this is BWC TV station , we 're being attacked . Send somebody fast or they gonna kill us ! Get out of here ! Help ! Help ! Hi . How are you feeling today ? Horrible . In this absurd world where people only cares about making money . Well now , people cares about your health as well . - Temperature ? - Normal , doctor . Continue with the antibiotics , every 8 hours . And complete rest . Hi , Jim . How are you feeling today ? I feel a lot better ... I have so much trust in you . You 've got to relax . Don 't worry . Tonight Dr. Kramer is going to operate you and tomorrow morning you 'll wake up fully recovered . You 'll get back to playing soccer in a month . - Is that the truth ? - The truth . Last night I had this nightmare ... It looked like war ... there was a big explosion ... A nuclear explosion ... and blood , a lot of blood . - You have too many bad dreams . - I ... Jim , you don 't have to think about war and death , you have to think about life , ok ? Well , ok . I 'll drop by and see you later . Our latest reports indicate the presence of attackers here ... here ... and here . This enables us to determine a presumed line of march . From the airport to the city limits ... then quite definitely in a north-eastern direction . We don 't know if this means a predetermined plan , but we must assume so , we have no other choice . Unfortunately , the reports reaching us from our various information centers , the latest from the National Science Academy , are all pretty sketchy . They do suggest , even in a vague way , the type of countermeasures to adopt . You may proceed . This is the body of one of the attackers . It was picked up on the runway at the airport . The autopsy categorically excludes an extra-terrestrial being . His molecular structure includes him in the human race . A paradox , when you consider what they 've been doing . Colonel , please . I 'm Colonel Donahue of the Institute for Atomic Research .. The examination of various tissue samples we have taken from the body , reveals the presence of a degree of radioactivity . Far superior to the level normally tolerated by the human organism . In addition , we have found , more or less , recent hyper tissue regeneration . Can you make that a little simpler , Colonel ? Some of your colleagues may not have the same theoretical or technical background . In other words , this individual , and others like him , have been subjected to strong doses of atomic radiation which increased their physical capacities beyond the normal . - How far beyond ? - That 's difficult to say . But it 's a fact that these cells , subjected to every treatment we know , have turned out to be almost indestructible . In short , it 's a kind of a superman . - Much more than that . - What do you mean ? I mean that the abnormal strengthening of the cells vital qualities has increased their direct genetic capacity . In other words , the victims of these creatures are contaminated , even if they only suffer minor injuries . Then they can reproduce themselves , say indefinitely . That , more or less , is correct . And you say , with our weapons , that they can 't be destroyed ? No , that their substance can 't . Excuse me , Colonel , isn 't that the same thing ? Not exactly . A machine may be indestructible , yet its functioning may still be blocked . HOW ? By interrupting the feeding process , for example . Atomic contamination destroys red blood cells in very short order . That 's why new blood is always needed for these creatures ... True , the human organism is greatly strengthened . However , the power still remains the brain . A lesion to the nerve centers can produce paralysis . The procedure stops the complex entirely . You mean only bullets damaging the cranium can stop these ... monsters ? This corpse is the proof . It 's the only lifeless body we have discovered . The cerebral apparatus has been destroyed . Thank you , Colonel . General Reedman , you 've heard everything . The order to any soldier and police officer is : " Aim to the brain " . You must be very specific about that . As for our combat plan , we must follow emergency plan H , and keep plan B in reserve in case the situation gets out of hand . That 's all for the moment , gentlemen . Thank you . Oh , Warren . I have to talk to you . Excuse me , General ... may I make a phone call ? - Alright but hurry it up . - Yes , sir . Yes , sir . At once . Hold on , please . Hello . Oh , it 's you , dear . I was in the bathroom doing my hair . I ... want to look nice for you this evening . I 'm afraid this evening 's out of the question . Can you tell me why ? - No , I can 't explain it now . - But I ... I want you to do exactly what I tell you . Understand ? Perfectly . I am to do what you wish and not ask why . A typical male chauvinist pig attitude . This is serious , don 't kid about it . Make sure all the doors and windows are locked . Nobody is to be let in , nobody , understand ? I 'll be home as soon as I can . And when I get there , you 're to make damn sure it 's me . Is that clear ? Yes , transparent . Have you become jealous all of a sudden ? Think whatever you want to think , but for God 's sake , do what I tell you ! Ok . General Polyclinic . May I help you ? Will you hold the line , please . Dr. Miller is wanted on the phone . It 's for you , Dr. Miller . Your husband . Tell him I 'm very busy . He can call me again later . Sorry , sir . But Dr. Miller is about to go into the operating room . Please , would you call again later ? I must speak with her now ... it 's urgent .. you can just ... - I 'm very sorry , but ... - I see . Thank you . Move ! Come on , Jessica . The camper is ready . Ok , I 'm coming . Is the camper all packed ? All packed , and filled up with gas . Ok , I 'll get it . No , leave it . Don 't answer it , it 's probably some bore . Or maybe your father who always wants to know where we 're going , and where we 're going to stop , and if we have enough money . It may be ... Generals are fussy , General Murchison is no exception . I really don 't know why I married Jessica Murchison . It isn 't even 3 months , and already you repent . - I 'm a pacifist . I hate uniforms . - Madam ... Hello . Good morning , madam . Your father wishes you to join him . Immediately at Defense headquarters . At headquarters ? Why ? He tried to phone you , but there wasn 't any answer . He says that you 're not to waste any time . I have a car outside . Did something serious happen ? Your father will explain everything to you . Maybe some kind of war broke out ... Ok ... you can wait for us in the car . Hello . May I talk to General Murchison ? It 's his daughter speaking . Would you hold the line , please . He is in a meeting . The line was cut off . It 's dead . Why don 't we just clear out of here ? I don 't like spending my weekend with a General . Neither do I. We could call him from a phone booth . Come on , hurry up ... We have to sneak out , so that idiot outside doesn 't realize anything . Ok ? Let 's go . The way is clear ... Come on . Dr. Miller , please . I 'm her husband . I 'm sorry . Dr. Miller 's in the operating room . She 's assisting Dr. Kramer in a very delicate operation . And we have strict orders not to disturb her . Sorry , Mr. Miller , orders are orders . Emergency 24 ! We picked up a woman with her throat slashed . Plasma needed urgently ! What the devil 's going on today ? That 's the 6th emergency in 2 hours . Alright , we 'll arrange for a transfusion . Call Dr. Sanders . Raise it ! Come on . It 's Whitey . Let him in . Come on , Whitey ! What are you standing there for ? What happened ? An accident ? Call an ambulance , there are injuries ! Help me , give me a hand ! Here the situation is critical . Unfortunately , they 've just sabotaged the south power station as well . We have a team of engineers there , but it 'll take hours before they can get it working again , with luck . Well ? The emergency generators and searchlights have been positioned at all strategic points in the city . - Well done . - General Murchison . Gentlemen ... the Government informs that other planes full of infected people have arrived , and orders we don 't leak any news that might cause public disorder . But ... we can 't conceal this from the public . It 's absurd ! The Government disagrees . We 'll just have to try to keep control of public buildings , barracks , hospitals , as long as we can , after which ... We just have a solution . You 're right , Warren . We 'll simply have to declare a state of emergency ourselves . Slowly .. - What happened to her ? - She has serious wounds in her throat . Quick , to the intensive care unit . An anesthetist , it 's urgent ! Quick , come on ! Quick , this way ! What the devil are they up to , those fools ? Why haven 't they turned on the emergency generators ? Two of the generators are out of order , doctor . They 're starting up the 3rd . It 'll provide just enough current for us and the emergency ward . Have you checked the pulse rate ? It 's weak but regular . Continue with direct oxygen . Keep that light steady ! Ah , it 's about time . Go and get more plasma . - And hurry ! - Yes , doctor . Help ! Open up this door ! Oh , my God , I can 't breathe ! I can 't hold on ... They can 't leave us here . I feel like I 'm going to faint ... Hey , open up this door ! Come on ! Open up ! What do you want ? Jim ! Jim ! Oh , no ... Jim ! Help ] Anna , where are you ? - It 's me , Anna , don 't be afraid . - Oh , it 's you . Take it easy . Oh , Dean . It 's horrible ! You can 't imagine ... it 's a massacre ! Yes , I know . Come . I can 't operate with this noise . Make them keep quiet . Keep still . Don 't move ! Let me go ! Help ! Let me go ! Help ! Help ! Help ! The emergency exit is on the right . Now ! Get us out of here ! I can 't breathe ... My heart feels like it 's bursting ! Help me ! Don 't push ! Keep still ! If we keep calm then we can all breathe a lot easier . Why doesn 't somebody do something ? These things have manual controls on them . Why don 't they wind us down ? You 're right . Hey ! Get us out of here ! It 's alright . Be ... calm . They 're lowering us down . Don 't push ! Get back ! Stop it ! Get back , everybody ! To the ambulance , go ! Dean ! Look out ! Take us down a little and turn left . A. F. 3 to base command ... This is Major Warren calling . We 're flying over the outlying areas ... So far we 've had no trace of the infected on this side . Only some cars heading out of town . Any news of your daughter ? No , none . I only hope she 's alright . I 'm sorry , Murchison , really I am . Thank you . Reedman , the situation is hopeless . Many parts of the country are cut off . Most of the phone lines are out . What 's worse , we 've lost contact with Government headquarters . We 'll have to declare a state of emergency ourselves . - But you realize ... - I 'm fully aware of the consequences . - I just see no alternative . - I understand . What are your orders ? Notify bases 112 and 401 to stand by with helicopters and if necessary squadrons of fighter bombers . We 'll try to get control back at once before it 's too late . Or before we all become contaminated , just like them . ... has declared a state of emergency . All civilians ha ve been ordered to remain in their houses or to place themselves under the direct protection of the police or the military . Private traffic may circulate only if authorized by the Civil Defense Command . It 's frightening . How could a thing like this happen ? It 's part of the vital cycle of the human race . Create and obliterate , until we destroy ourselves . Words . We 're up against a race of monsters . Created by other monsters who have only one thing on their mind : the discovery of greater power . At least this time there won 't be any historical justifications . Even if any of us survive . Do you think it 's possible to stop them ? The infection is like an oil stain , and who knows how far the contagion has spread now . ... with the danger of the contamination , public buildings and private enterprises will remain closed for an indefinite time . Weekend vacationers are ordered to reach immediately the nearest populated areas . The Civil Defense authorities have further stated that ... Jessica , stop that humming ! It 's getting on my nerves . Bob , what 's wrong ? You 're getting a bit too nervous ... I just heard a newsflash on the radio . Something serious has happened in town ... They 've declared a state of emergency . A state of emergency ? Does it have to do with my father ? I don 't know . It 's difficult to understand . But we should go back to town . But we just arrived ... I 've no intention of giving up my weekend . To hell with the emergency . Listen , you 're General Murchison 's daughter and it 's my duty to take you back home ... - Something doesn 't feel right in this place . - Like what ? Like that continuous barking , without seeing a dog around . And we haven 't seen another car for more than one hour . In a place like this , usually full of campers . Listen . It 's almost 10 . The Jones ' should arrive soon . Let 's talk with them . They should know what 's happened in town . Just as you like . Bob ! Come here ! He seems to be burned alive . There they are ! Martha ! Ted ! Oh , are we glad you are here . Martha , what 's going on ? Hey ! What are you doing with that gun ? Sheila ... Sheila ! Can you hear me ? It 's me , Cindy . Let me in , please ! For God 's sake , I 'm afraid being outside all alone ! Open the door ! Open the door , please ... I 'm alone . Oh , Sheila ! I thought I was going mad . I just couldn 't stand it anymore ! Being in the house all alone . Now relax . Come . Johnny went off to work and the cleaning woman never showed up . I kept hearing noises everywhere . On the roof , in the cellar , everywhere . Well , you can relax now . We 're safe here ... At least for the moment . Warren is coming as soon as he can . God , Sheila , what 's going on ? I don 't know ... I really don 't know . Have you tried calling Gracie ? Her husband is with the department of something or ... or other . How could I call ? The phone hasn 't been working for 3 hours . You sure ? Not working here , either . There must be a breakdown at the exchange . Cheer up . Drink this . I 'm frightened , Sheila . Really frightened . On the radio they say to stay home , and lock all the doors and windows . I did it . I even barricaded the coal-hole to the cellar . What did you say ? That I barricaded the coal-hole to the cellar . How did I managed to forget that ? Wait , Sheila ! Don 't leave me alone . I 'll come with you . Thanks for reminding me . What was it ? Nothing . Light a candle ... And stay down here . Sheila ! Sheila ! Sheila ! Why didn 't they stop us ? We have a Red Cross protecting us . What is it , dear ? We 're running out of gas . Down there . A " ! / body here ? Anna ! You can get out . There 's nobody here . What do you think about it ? It 's a bit flashy , but it 's better than this . Just like a western . Except that , they didn 't have ... instant coffee in the good old days . Another advantage of civilization . Like Coca-Cola and nuclear energy . Believe me : we are living in the age of the advantages . This is good . Do you think we should give up ... the advantages we have gained ? Maybe it would be better . However it 's not the fault of science and technology , but of man . We proud ourselves on having invented computers and we were not able to predict a mess like this . - How long will it last ? - I don 't know . But one thing is clear , we 're partly to blame ourselves . Just think of the life we have led ... up until today . Shut up in those ridiculous cities . In a steel and concrete jungles . Like machines . All this had to happen to realize the truth . Let 's hope it isn 't too late . ... according to the latest reports from the Civil Defense headquarters , groups of saboteurs are on the edge of the city . Public buildings have been ravaged . Last night the general hospital has been hit the hardest by people contaminated with radiation . 37 people were reported to die and many more were injured . Military authorities has ordered that all commando units ... Anna , it 's better we start moving . Get all the provisions you can . I 'll get the gas . Help ! Help me , Dean ! One of them is outside ! I saw him ! It won 't hold up for long . Find some cloth , something that can burn . Take this ... Perfect . Come . They 're all together . When I say ' now ' , you open the door , ok ? - But I can 't ... - Shut up ! Do what I say and don 't argue ! Alright . Now ! Let 's go ! Do you want some more ? Don 't give in . Hang on ! I 'm really tired . And I 'm frightened . I can 't take it anymore . Dean , please , help me . Relax . Nothing is going to happen as long as we stay together . I promise you . What we 've got to do now is get away from here as fast as we can . But where ? Why don 't we face it ? We 're not going to survive ! They 're all around us , they 're waiting for us ! We are trapped like two flies in a spider 's web . We 'll never survive . Never ! Stop it ! Get down ! Run and don 't look back ! Here they are ! Get us down ! Get us down a bit closer ! A. F. 3 to base command ... I 've located a whole group of them . They are moving in an east direction towards the main waterworks . I 'm afraid they want to sabotage the pipelines . Request General Murchison immediate air assistance . Over ! Base command to A.F. 3 . Message received . Will pass your request to General Murchison at once . Who 's that ? Reedman ? Just listen to me , Reedman . I 'm not interested in your opinion . I know it 's a huge risk ! I agree with that , but there 's no alternative ! Just carry out my orders ! If necessary you can go to Chambers yourself . We 'll find some solution in the end . I 'm sure . You know there 's no solution . All we can fight for is a little time ! But how much ? - What about this place ? - Looks peaceful . Let 's go ! Wait here . - Well ? - Come . There 's nobody here . - But the bell is ringing ? - I told you nobody 's there . Let 's go ! Remember the medieval legends ? They say that demons and vampires can 't enter the House of God . Come , I 'm sure there 's no risk . Thank the Lord , Father ! We really need help ... Captain ! What 's going on around here ? Where are the other officers ? Why hasn 't somebody responded on the radio ? We located other infected areas north of here over the beltway . So get those planes in the air . Answer me ! Or are you looking for a court-martial ? Don 't move , Major , or I 'll kill you ! You can 't fool me . You 're like all the rest . Contaminated ! You brought death and destruction . You destroyed my squadron . But you don 't fool me no more ! Put that gun down ! Have you gone crazy ? I don 't intend to die . I want to live ! A. F. 3 to base command ... This is Major Warren calling . Vaden Airport has been sabotaged . No chance the fighters can intervene . Standing by ... for further orders . Just a minute , Major ... I will pass you over to General Murchison . Warren ? This is Murchison . Listen carefully . All communications with operational command units have been cut off . Do you hear me ? Variant B is out . Return to base . Do you hear me ? Your mission is useless now . Message received , General . Will do . Over and out . Oh , Donahue . I suppose you 're here to tell me your experiment didn 't work out . On the contrary . The gas has proven effective . Our planes can fire it with their missile launchers . General Reedman must be informed immediately . But , Donahue , we have no planes ! Not anymore . And there 's no more Reedman . But didn 't he leave for the airbase at Chambers ? He never got there . They brought him here 20 minutes ago . May God help us all . Wait here ! We 're taking on a passenger ! Sheila ... Where are you ? Why did you leave the door open ? I mean , I told you ... My God ... No , Sheila ! Sheila ! Anna ... Just try to understand , I had to kill that priest ! Ok , but ... Look ! - Maybe it still works . - Wait here . - When I give you the signal , run to the jeep fast . - Ok . Run for it , Anna ! Run ! Hurry ! Hey ! Help ! Help ! Hey ! Let 's try to pull them outta there . Hurry up ! But , Major , is it worth it ? Maybe they 're already infected . Just do what I tell you ! Come on ! Just pull ! Come on ! Come on ! - Don 't look down ! - Come on . Just pull . You can do it . I can 't hold on ! - Don 't let go ! - I can 't hold on ! What is it , dear ? What 's wrong ? Why , it 's ... it 's nothing . I had a horrible dream . A nightmare . Anna , how do you feel ? Are you alright ? I just wanna go to sleep ! I 'm so sleepy ... God ! It 's late ! I have to get to the airport ! I 've got an interview to do with the nuclear scientist , Professor Hagenbeck . He 's an important man . He runs the nuclear state plant . Who ? Professor Hagenbeck . But , dear , are you listening to me ? He hasn 't arrived yet . Find out what runway they are landing on . Ok . Hey , Willy . There 's an unidentified trace ... This is control tower . Identify yourself . Maybe their radio isn 't working . It looks like it 's going to land . He 's coming in on 25 ... Make sure that runway 's clear , and declare an emergency . What the hell is going on ? - I don 't know . - Let 's see . - What 's the story ? - Nobody answers , sir . In the name of the law , open the door ! I repeat : in the name of the law , open the door !

 Okay . - May I see that ? [ br ] - Sure . Hey , hero ! Willie . Hello , Harmony . Everybody 's raving [ br ] about how you rescued Caleb . They said your face was blistered , [ br ] but you look okay . Hey , you want a burger ? No . Don 't you guys eat ? Sometimes . You go to movies ? No , I do not . Yet . Well ? - You are fun ? [ br ] - What ? Feeling better ? Feeling fun ? Fine . Fine , yes . Fine ? Yeah , I 'm okay , yeah . Look ... - William . [ br ] - William . I 'm sorry I called you a stupid alien . Oh , no . Here . The world was shocked today when Nobel [ br ] Prize winner Dr. Maurice Jankowski of the Brussels Biomedical [ br ] Institute in Belgium held a press conference [ br ] to reveal an international conspiracy [ br ] against the Visitors . It came to my attention first [ br ] when Dr. Rudolph Metz in California asked to speak on what he [ br ] called " urgent confidential matters . " Other colleagues here are also [ br ] being approached by scientists . Biomedical and anthropological [ br ] scientists from many nations who apparently are part [ br ] of this insidious conspiracy . Their plans , simply , are to seize [ br ] control of several motherships belonging to the Visitors . They tried hard to convince me [ br ] that it was to protect the human race . Or keep such powers [ br ] from the military on our planet . I do believe , however , that their [ br ] motivation is by far more personal . Then Jankowski signed his statement listing those who introduced [ br ] him to the conspiracy . When word began to spread [ br ] of the Jankowski statement the international scope [ br ] revealed itself as many scientists came forth [ br ] to admit they had been approached or actually confessed [ br ] that they were part of the conspiracy . Seen here is Dr. Jacques Duvivier , [ br ] also a Nobel Laureate physician , and biochemist ... Damn scientists . ... who was detained by the French [ br ] police and confessed to involvement naming many other scientists [ br ] as his co-conspirators . It 's a vicious lie , I tell you ! You don 't need a warrant . [ br ] Go on , search my files ! There 's nothing . You 'll find nothing ! What 's that ? I never saw that . No . It 's not true . I don 't know how this got there . It 's a lie , I tell you ! - Quinton 's still missing ? [ br ] - And a half dozen others . The police don 't have a clue [ br ] as to what 's going on . ... lends credence to the charges [ br ] brought against them . Kristine Walsh , press secretary for the Visitor supreme commander , [ br ] John , had this to say : The Visitors were shocked [ br ] to learn of this conspiracy and fearful of the chaos [ br ] which could possibly result . Not only would their own needs [ br ] be impaired but all the benefits they plan [ br ] to share with us could be endangered . Scientific seminars , which were [ br ] to start next week , are postponed . Because it 's too early to determine [ br ] how many scientists may be involved the U.N. has agreed to Visitor [ br ] requests that all scientists and their families must register [ br ] their whereabouts with authorities . Computers will be used [ br ] to verify their registration . Abraham , don 't get so wound up . [ br ] Nothing 's going to happen . Not to you or your family . They 're not doctors or biologists [ br ] or even scientists . You 're not involved . [ br ] Anyway , it 's going to pass . That 's what I said in 1938 [ br ] back in Berlin . But this is different . Is it ? The supreme commander [ br ] wants to make it clear that while he 's sure [ br ] all scientists aren ' t part of the conspiracy it is still difficult to ascertain [ br ] which of them may or may not be . While international police [ br ] have scoured scientific files for facts on the conspiracy startling evidence is being found [ br ] that many scientists have had breakthroughs in research [ br ] which they 've suppressed . Senate Medical Affairs Committee [ br ] Chairman Raymond Burke said : Yes , indeed . I do have evidence that new and revolutionary [ br ] cancer treatments do exist and have existed for some time along with [ br ] many other breakthroughs which apparently our scientific [ br ] friends kept quiet about and haven ' t shared with us . [ br ] - Why ? I won ' t speculate , except to say there 's a lot of money to be made [ br ] in research grants . Excuse me ... I 'm sorry I 'm late . [ br ] Dr. Metz is really hurting , and Ruth has completely disappeared ... [ br ] - Take your time . They called to cancel dinner . Honey , you must be [ br ] really disappointed . Yeah . Think you 'll still get their account ? I don 't think so . They were too polite . [ br ] You know ? I don 't understand this . I mean , [ br ] how can they treat you like that ? Denny , do you think it 's me ? They know that I 'm a biochemist [ br ] and a med student ... No , no . How could it be you ? Well , you seem a little too polite . Yeah , I saw this before . So ? Something struck me funny , [ br ] but I couldn 't figure it out . All night , I 'm trying to sleep [ br ] and suddenly it hits me . Look . It 's a tape of him [ br ] at that science fair last year . Remember when he autographed [ br ] that book for my old man ? Yeah . Don 't you see , Mike ? He used his right hand . And yesterday he used his left hand . - So he 's ambidextrous ? [ br ] - No , no , he 's not . And neither is Duvivier . I checked . No , Mike . Until this week , [ br ] they were both right-handed . Something very strange [ br ] is going on here . Come on . I 'm not very good at this . Brian , what 's it like out there ? It 's magnificent . Very peaceful . Which one 's yours ? Right there . It 's the brightest . It 's in the constellation [ br ] you call Canis Major . Must be strange to be [ br ] so far away from home . Yeah , it is . But new friends make it easier . I 'm glad . Hi , Robin . - Daniel . [ br ] - Hey . How 's your father ? He 's fine . You know , it must be pretty tough [ br ] nowadays being a scientist especially an anthropologist . Yeah . - Hi , Daniel . [ br ] - Hi . How are you ? Good . Her father 's [ br ] an anthropologist , huh ? - You didn 't know ? [ br ] - No . I had no idea . Yeah . Shouldn 't we just take the squad [ br ] vehicle like we usually do ? They won 't know we 're there . [ br ] We 've got a better chance of seeing what 's going on . Okay . They got the chemical loaded [ br ] onboard . Get ready . Now ! Mike . - Come on . Come on . [ br ] - I can 't ... I can 't get my foot up . Come on . I got you . Come on . Damn ! Tanker unit 14 . [ br ] Stand by for venting operation . Tanker unit 14 . [ br ] Stand by for venting operation . What a waste of time , bringing these [ br ] chemicals here and dumping them out . Tanker arrival schedule [ br ] is as follows : From Los Angeles at 21 : 00 hours . From Santa Barbara [ br ] at 21 : 14 and 21 : 42 hours . From San Diego at 21 : 50 , 22 : 00 and 22 : 15 hours . All tanker units , check in [ br ] for late changes in assignments . All tanker units , check in [ br ] for late changes in assignments . Every continent will soon be under [ br ] our domination . You must be pleased . Well , let 's just say that [ br ] it pleases me to serve our leader with whatever minor talents [ br ] I possess . Our leader is very pleased [ br ] with your conversion process . Yes , but you know how impatient [ br ] our leader can be . Even with you ? I thought that given the intimacy of your [ br ] relationship with him , he might ... Be very careful , Steven . I just hate to see him [ br ] make you so distressed . He doesn 't understand [ br ] my conversion process is limited . It doesn 't work the same [ br ] on every human . No , but when it does work as with Duvivier , Jankowski [ br ] and the others , it 's remarkable . Yes , it is . They actually believe [ br ] that a conspiracy exists or even that they 're part of it . And of course the evidence that [ br ] we planted reinforces their beliefs . The operation is working perfectly . Scientists are being ostracized , [ br ] disorganized throughout the world . The problem is , our leader then says , [ br ] " Why not convert them all ? " He doesn 't understand the human will [ br ] is much tougher than we bargained for . To convert them all [ br ] would take forever . However , we will continue [ br ] to refine the process . Yes , I 'm sure you will , successfully . We must find the most effective and efficient methods [ br ] to be used against them . I don 't think our leader [ br ] could have chosen anyone who could do a better job than you . Particularly given the success [ br ] of the previous one . Well , as long as we can keep [ br ] the public 's confidence ... I 'm tired of these drills . Let 's go [ br ] before we have to sit through another . Emergency situation on level 73 . All units to standby alert . All units to standby alert . Emergency situation on level 73 . All units to standby alert . - This is L.A. [ br ] - Okay , we 've got a hot one . I 'm testing on the PL . Hello , New York ? You got me , Burt ? Okay , listen . [ br ] We 're going to do an interrupt . Alert all the affiliates , [ br ] full network . Yes . Mike Donovan has a tape that 's [ br ] supposed to knock our socks off . We 're feeding bars and tone right now . - It 's leaving . [ br ] - Dan , go check your patching . - Stand by , that special tape . [ br ] - We 're ready . Why would they take that chemical [ br ] to the mothership then just dump it into the air ? [ br ] - Beats me . Here they come . - Get double mikes on that right now . [ br ] - You sit right there . I 'll do the setup , intro you , [ br ] we 'll roll the tape , and ... - Andy , please ? [ br ] - Right . - 30 seconds . [ br ] - 30 seconds . Now , give me lights now . Camera one ... Now I 'm gonna start [ br ] with two , then come to one . You okay , Mike ? Ten seconds . [ br ] Quiet on the line ! You 're breaking up a little . [ br ] Five , four ... Five seconds , four , three , two , one . - New York , take your slide . [ br ] - And cue announce . - The following is a special report . [ br ] - Coming two , and ... Take two . Cue , please . An astonishing occurrence just took [ br ] place on the mothership just off ... - What happened ? [ br ] - Hello , New York ? Hold on , we 've got a problem . - What 's going on ? [ br ] - Hello ? They what ? - We 've lost Ma Bell . [ br ] - We 've what ? Somebody 's pulled ATT [ br ] right out from under us . They pulled the plug . [ br ] The whole damn network 's off the air . And so are both the others . What 's that , Burt ? Hello ? Hello ? And now I 've lost New York . Dead , dead . No , I cannot . Here 's something . This is Kristine Walsh . The Visitors ' supreme commander , [ br ] John , is here to make a statement . My friends throughout the world first , I must thank [ br ] the leaders of each your countries who have graciously turned over [ br ] all their broadcasting facilities to us to help avoid confusion [ br ] in this crisis . I 'm sad to say that there has been [ br ] a carefully coordinated and quite violent attempt [ br ] by the conspiracy of scientists to commandeer control [ br ] of our facilities at many key locations [ br ] around the world . I don 't believe it . This is Dupres . Have we been hit ? Oh , thank goodness ! Damn scientists ! Two dozen other places [ br ] suffered similar assaults . - The loss of life has been enormous . [ br ] - I don 't believe this . - Both to your people and ours . [ br ] - Believe it . In addition , thousands [ br ] have been wounded , and we 're fearful [ br ] there will be more attacks . I 'm going to the hospital . The outbreak is so widespread [ br ] and so dangerous that most civilian members [ br ] of your governments have asked us for protection which , of course , [ br ] we 're more than happy to provide . They 're safe aboard our ships , [ br ] and we 'll take good care of them . I 'm also very sorry to report that this man , in whom [ br ] we had placed considerable trust Michael Donovan of the U. S. , has [ br ] proved to be the biggest traitor to your peace ... [ br ] - No ! It isn 't true ! He is armed and dangerous ... I want my tape . [ br ] I 'm setting up to copy it now . - Man , we are in big trouble . [ br ] - Tell me about it . Get going . [ br ] Mike . Mike , your tape . Your national leaders [ br ] have suggested that a state of martial law [ br ] will be most helpful at this time . And we agree . Police at local levels will work [ br ] with Visitor patrols . And we will also ask the help [ br ] of all our Visitor Friends units . - All right ! [ br ] - We anticipate this crisis will pass relatively quickly . In the meantime , friends , [ br ] I and my fellow Visitors will do our best [ br ] to see you through it and maintain control . There will be [ br ] more announcements later . Gotta go ! It 'll pass . You heard what he said . Right , Dad ? Around the nation and the world Visitors are keeping order [ br ] and making friends . Police and military forces [ br ] in each country are cooperating fully . The clear and present danger [ br ] still exists , however from the terrorists [ br ] who brought about the need for martial law by their assaults . These attacks by scientist [ br ] conspirators are continuing sporadically and violently [ br ] around the world . - In Buenos Aires last night ... [ br ] - We 've been lucky not to have that happen [ br ] at our plant . Several cryogenic storage tanks containing the synthetic chemical [ br ] were damaged . But heroic efforts [ br ] by the Visitor technicians saved them and the lives [ br ] of fifteen workers . How could they be faking all this ? - The movies do it all the time . [ br ] - The curfew set at 8 : 00 still must be maintained . It isn 't fair . [ br ] I want to go out some nights . - Why ? Daniel comes by here . [ br ] - It isn 't Daniel that I want to see . Who is it , Robin ? Never mind . Of course the military [ br ] are cooperating fully . They 're all under house arrest . Mrs. Maxwell ? Hello , Sancho . What 's the matter ? I can 't work for you no more . Why not ? - It 's ... [ br ] - Well , tell me . The other people that I work for know [ br ] I work for you . They don 't like it . But why should the other people ... ? Because my husband is a scientist ? They say I could either work [ br ] for them or for you . - My family , they ... [ br ] - That 's okay . Never mind . I understand . - Polly ? Are you hurt ? What happened ? [ br ] - I got in a fight . Bunch of jerkos beat up on me because I won the science fair . [ br ] - What ? Yeah , they wrecked it up , said I was [ br ] just a dirty little scientist 's kid . You should have seen them . - How many were there ? [ br ] - Four . What happened to your teachers ? [ br ] Didn 't they see ? One did , but he just walked [ br ] the other way . I guess I better fix my bike . [ br ] Thanks , Mr. Bernstein . - You going to Manhattan to your folks ? [ br ] - No , I can 't get through to them . It 's better if you don 't know anyway . I 'll get the rest later sometime . - Don 't you think you 're overreacting ? [ br ] - No , Denny . I don 't want you losing [ br ] any more accounts . - Look , we don 't know for sure ... [ br ] - No , we don 't ! And that 's the really nasty part . They 're always so polite . [ br ] But we know , don 't we ? Anyway another biochemist , Phyllis ... [ br ] You remember her ? Well , she didn 't show today . [ br ] And nobody 's heard from her . Just like Ruth and all the others . Maybe she just went away . Just like this . - Maybe she was taken . [ br ] - There 's no truth to those rumors . Shall I stay then ? You should do [ br ] whatever makes you happy . See you , Denny . And there were even fewer incidents [ br ] of violence today . People are starting to report in [ br ] to authorities when they suspect someone might be involved [ br ] with the conspiracy . This early warning [ br ] will save countless lives . - The supreme commander urges ... [ br ] - I 'm so tired of her face and only hearing one side [ br ] of what 's going on . Well , the truth is the truth . Then why not let others say it ? Hey . Don 't you think [ br ] you 've had enough of that ? No . I do . Come on , Stanley . [ br ] There 's the newspaper too . Yeah . And it says [ br ] exactly what she says . Sometimes it 's word for word . It 's not just that . Look at these bills . [ br ] The price is up on everything . To make a long-distance call [ br ] you need a special permit . Even then , most times [ br ] you can 't get through . - You always said this would pass . [ br ] - Yeah . It 'd better hurry up before we sink . [ br ] I want things back the way they were . - Where 's Daniel ? [ br ] - Well , he 's not out looking for a job . Stanley you 've got to be [ br ] more careful what you say . - What ? In my own house ? [ br ] - Yeah , but he lives here . You know how involved he is with them . - But he shouldn 't have the right ... [ br ] - I 've heard stories . - Rumors . [ br ] - Stories about how his [ br ] group member had actually ... Done what ? Informed ? On his own parents . And they disappeared . - Lynn , I hardly think that Daniel ... [ br ] - Well , I hardly think so too , but ... I mean , what 's to inform on ? [ br ] We 're not scientists and I didn 't say anything . [ br ] - You were very critical of her and them , [ br ] of the newspapers , everything . - Of him . [ br ] - He shouldn 't drink that much . That 's not all you said . Look , all I said was , [ br ] I was tired of hearing ... Hearing one side of the news . [ br ] Their side . Well , I meant hearing only one opinion . No , not that . I meant ... You don 't really think [ br ] he 'd call them , do you ? Where have you been , Daniel ? Just to the bathroom . You think he 's lying ? I don 't want to go to the mountains . [ br ] I hate our place up there . - It 's so boring . [ br ] - Get in the car . Try to understand . [ br ] Too many things are happening . A scientist your dad worked with [ br ] was arrested for conspiracy . - Polly got beaten up at school . [ br ] - And Quinton is still missing . Why don 't we stay and fight ? It 's not that easy , Poll . Oh , God . But Daddy is no conspirator . Neither were they . - Get in the car . [ br ] - All my friends are here . - Yeah , especially ones in uniform . [ br ] - Shut up , Polly . - I can stay with Karen and her family . [ br ] - Right now , Robin ! Please ! It 's all right . I think . All right . We know what 's happening . [ br ] Totalitarian suppression of the truth . Not only on TV , but they 've got the [ br ] papers too . We are under martial law . And paranoia . Everyone , especially [ br ] scientists , are scared to death . Or disappearing . Like my partner [ br ] or any other cop who refused to cooperate with [ br ] the Visitors when they requested that we help them maintain order . They took another doctor [ br ] and his family from my building . Why are they anxious [ br ] to arrest so many scientists ? They must think that scientists [ br ] might find a way to stop them . There 's no way to stop them . [ br ] There 's too many . No . There has to be a way . Well , there is . We organize . Any complex structure , [ br ] like our bodies , for example starts with individual cells . The cells will reproduce , expand , [ br ] and join with others . - That 's lovely in biology , but ... [ br ] - Listen , Brad ! I 'm sorry . Look , I know that we 're embryonic . There 's only just a handful of us . [ br ] But we 're not the only ones huddled in the dark like this . I know there are others like us [ br ] all around the world . We 're not the only ones [ br ] who want to fight . She 's right . Now what we 've got to do is find [ br ] the others who feel just like we do . Then we all go out [ br ] and look for more and more . We need equipment for a lab , [ br ] communication . And a place to put it , headquarters . And we should find out [ br ] who 's closest to the Visitors and get them on our side . Like ... What 's her name ? [ br ] That Kristine ... Walsh , yes . Now she 's surely [ br ] on the inside . Maybe too much on the inside . - One of us should contact her . [ br ] - I think so . I 'll find her , and find out [ br ] if we can trust her . Why don 't we meet back here [ br ] Thursday night ? - Fine by me . [ br ] - Sounds good to me . And everybody has to bring [ br ] at least four other people with them . - Agreed ? [ br ] - Agreed . Hello , Uncle Pedro ? - Uncle Pedro ? [ br ] - It is you . Buenas noches . - Tony , cut the ... [ br ] - We 've been having phone trouble . Understand ? [ br ] Trouble with the phone . You must be all " tapped " out . You got it , Uncle . The repairmen [ br ] even came to check things out . They smelled your cooking [ br ] all around here . Would they like to get [ br ] their hands on your burrito ! - Yeah , I 'm sure they would . [ br ] - Yeah , but I like Italian food [ br ] much better , remember ? Yeah . Yeah , I remember . Don 't let me keep you . I know you have to run . Good luck . Another one . - Why do they keep us in the city ? [ br ] - Makes it easier to find us . Why is it so important to them ? We 're not sure , Poll , but it is . Stop that guy ! - I said , halt ! [ br ] - Get that guy ! - Another scientist ? [ br ] - No , but he tried to help one cross . - So he 'll share their treatment . [ br ] - Easy , he 's wounded . That 's his fault . He breaks the law , [ br ] he pays the consequences . - This is different . [ br ] - No , it ain 't ! A crook 's a crook . Nothing 's changed except the guys [ br ] who give the orders . How are we getting through ? - Are we gonna fight ? [ br ] - No . Now where are we going ? - Who 's gonna help us ? [ br ] - I don 't know . I do . Turn the car around . The big bad doctor needs my help ? [ br ] How come ? - You 've got contacts on the street . [ br ] - Damn right , I do . But ain 't you always [ br ] putting down the streets ? But times have changed , Elias . Well , the streets ain 't . [ br ] They ain 't changed a bit . There 's just another man out there [ br ] to be " the man . " Matter of fact , the streets [ br ] is getting a lot better . You can make a lot of money now , [ br ] in a hurry . - Black market . [ br ] - Pardon the expression , brother . Any idea how much fresh fruit 's [ br ] going for these days ? And beef ? I make more selling hamburger [ br ] than I did selling reefer . You can keep on doing [ br ] all that you want , Elias . - Some of us are trying to fight . [ br ] - Why fight it ? - It don 't affect me , I 'm making money . [ br ] - Elias . What is happening is wrong . Says who ? - I need your help . [ br ] - What about when I needed yours ? - I was always there for you . [ br ] - Oh , yeah . Just a little unapproachable . - The golden boy . [ br ] - Man , that 's only in your head . If I heard it once , [ br ] I heard it a thousand times : " Why can 't you be like [ br ] brother Benjamin , the doctor ? " Now you need my help ? That 's right . I 'd sure like to , but you see , I gotta go to the medical [ br ] library and do my studying . I 'll catch you later , brother . Helen and Stanley never [ br ] use this place . It 's just for storage . It 's gross . We can 't live here , [ br ] it 's filthy ! We can clean it . - There 's no way it 's ever ... [ br ] - Robin ! That 's enough . It 's fine , Abraham . Thank you . - Forgive my daughter ... [ br ] - It 's all right , I understand . I 'm not sure I do . Father , can I talk to you , outside ? - I can 't believe you brought them . [ br ] - They have nowhere to go . Their house is being watched . So is ours , by Daniel ! [ br ] Tell them we 're sorry . You don 't understand , they must stay . [ br ] They need a place to hide . - And why is that ? [ br ] - Because the father is a scientist . He 's a suspect and a fugitive , [ br ] making them even more dangerous . - They have to stay . [ br ] - Get them out of here before ... - I won 't ! [ br ] - Then I will ! No , you won 't ! We had to put you in a suitcase . In a suitcase . You were 8 months old . That 's how we got you out . - I know this story , Father . [ br ] - No , you don 't ! You don 't . Your mother , auv shalom your mother didn 't have [ br ] a heart attack in the boxcar . She made it with me , to the camp . I can still see her , standing naked in the freezing cold . Her beautiful black hair was gone . They 'd shaved her head . I can still see her waving to me as they [ br ] marched her off with the others , to the showers . The showers with no water . Perhaps if somebody had given us [ br ] a place to hide ... Don 't you see , Stanley ? [ br ] They have to stay or else we haven 't learned a thing . Mike ! My God ! [ br ] You scared the hell out of me . - I 've been so worried for you . [ br ] - I 've been worried for me too . Why are they so hot to capture you ? - Because I 've seen their faces . [ br ] - What ? - You don 't believe me , do you ? [ br ] - It 's incredible ! - Reptilian , with tongues that ... [ br ] - It 's true , I 've seen it . - I believe you think you 've seen it . [ br ] - Think ? Damn it . I work closely with them [ br ] every day . It 's hard to ... Be objective . I 'm wasting my time . - Don 't leave yet . [ br ] - Why ? Can I see the tape ? It 's hidden . Mike , listen . We started this together , [ br ] and it 's possible you 're right . Maybe I did get too close to them . It 's funny I always wanted [ br ] to be closer to you . You 've got a funny way of showing it . I 'd really like another chance . Thanks . Hey . Danny ! You scared me ! - What are you doing here ? [ br ] - They fell asleep so I snuck out . I couldn 't stand it in [ br ] your pool house another minute . - Our pool house ? [ br ] - It 's too small for one , but five ? It 's totally outrageous . You 've been drinking . Yeah . - With Brian ? [ br ] - He was there . He doesn 't drink . I don 't think he can hold it . Did he ask about me ? No . Is he supposed to ? Well , I thought he might . Not tonight , he didn 't . You know , I 'm very glad to see you . - You look very pretty . [ br ] - Other nights , though ? - What ? [ br ] - He asks about me other nights ? Sometimes , yeah , I guess . He wondered where you went . We both did . Me , especially . Until I found out [ br ] you were in my pool house . Remember when you said you didn 't [ br ] want to die until you 'd made love ? - Do you still feel that way ? [ br ] - Sure . Is he still a virgin , do you think ? Who ? Brian . This will help us find [ br ] some of their weaknesses . I hope so . Let 's get a move on . [ br ] I 'm not sure they bought my act . Where 's Ben ? Go ! Go ! Go ! Wake up , Julie ! Let 's go ! What are you stopping for ? I 'm going back for Ben ! - You 're crazy ! [ br ] - No , we can 't leave him there ! Julie ! Julie ! Oh , my God ! Julie , no . No . Go on , get out of here . I 'm not gonna make it . Six bucks [ br ] For a dozen clucks Is Caleb here ? - What happened ? [ br ] - Ben 's been hurt . What went down ? We stole lab equipment [ br ] and they shot him . What ? The Doc ? Stealing stuff ? You ought to come to me , man . [ br ] I 'll show you how to do it . They got you too ? I should get an ambulance . No . No ambulance . We 've already made our diagnosis , [ br ] haven 't we , doctor ? I don 't understand . [ br ] Why try to pull a heist without your little brother 's expertise ? [ br ] - But we did it . The truck did get away . But look at you . You a wreck ! - Man , you can 't do this stuff alone ... [ br ] - Is Papa here ? No , uh ... He ain 't get here yet . But now listen here , man . Do I try doctoring ? Of course not ! The next time [ br ] you go boost some stuff you 're gonna come to me first . [ br ] I 'll show you how ... Ain 't nothing to it , it 's like lifting [ br ] these here eggs , man . Shoot . I sound like Papa now , " shoot . " He 'll be here any minute now . Elias . Anyway , you gonna come to me , right ? We 'll take them on together , yeah . The two of us , [ br ] The Bad Taylor Brothers . Elias . They 'll say , " Whoa ! What blew [ br ] through here , Jack ? " The Bad , Bad Taylor Brothers , [ br ] oh , yeah . Taylor Brothers , man . [ br ] The doctor ! The doctor and , uh ... The doctor and the other one . The other one . Elias . No ! The doctor cannot die . Sure , the other one can die . He can die , but not not ... not ... Ben . Not Ben . Damn it , Ben . Damn it . No ! If you 're going to do it , [ br ] do it right . I 'll show you . You understand ? For victory . Go tell your friends .

 Sergeant ramsay , line 2232 . Sergeant ramsay , line 2232 , please . - They want me . - I 've got this . Ramsay . What 's the model ? 7799 agricultural ? - Ramsay ? - What location ? - This is marvin . Officer thompson . - Nice to meet you . That 's ramsay , your partner . Your new partner . Good luck with him . - Jack ramsay . - Karen thompson . - I 'm on my way . - A runaway , jack ? - Yeah . Can you order us a copter ? - Yeah . - Come on , partner . - Now ? If you 're gonna keep up , you gotta move . Give me the pad . I need a chopper for ramsay . You 'll need your gloves and standard pro-gs . Standard pro-gs ? - What was your last assignment ? - Traffic . Did you like it ? Working with you is a step up from traffic . Maybe . You know anything about robotics and computers ? A little . Basics . I was gonna be a data programmer . Do we need all this to ... ? - Jack , your copter 's on the pad . - Great . Let 's go , partner . Is that it ? Standard agricultural model 7799 pest controller . Cpu is an old 8088 . - Any armament ? - Just a claw . It 's only programmed to look for things smaller than an inch . Could be a problem . You may not need all that . You may just have to throw a switch . That 's all ? Well , you never know until you get there . I guess you 've been doing this for a while ? Yeah , a couple of years . It 's interesting work . Dave , how far away are we ? Should be almost there . Let 's have a look . Right up there , jack . What do you know ? It 's a clear runaway track in the field to the left . You okay ? Yeah , i 'm fine . I just don 't like heights . My brother has the same problem . Take deep breaths . I 'm fine . Dave , can you land this sucker ? Put on your gloves . They sure took long enough to get here . - What 's the problem ? - That thing 's running a zigzag course . I 'm not going in that field after it . Fuel cells will blow up in your face . You go on and take a look . - Have you had it serviced ? - Regular . Isn 't that what you 're getting paid for ? You skedaddle in there . Oh , there you are . I seen that coming . You okay ? Let 's get him . World war iii ! I think they got it . I could 've done the same thing with my.22. We could 've blown the damn thing up . - It 's all yours , fellas . - Thanks a lot . How long you say you 've been doing this ? I just sort of fell into it by accident . I kind of liked it , so i took some night courses in robotics , apl . All of a sudden , i just seemed to know more about it than anybody else . You ever wanna work the regular force ? This is the regular force . You mean working the streets ? I did that . I had to stop . Because of vertigo ? I don 't like heights . I 've had it all my life . Anyway , i just decided it wasn 't a good idea to work the streets with that kind of fear . You wouldn 't run into a situation like that very often . - You could work the streets ... - i decided i 'd rather do this . Hey , jack , lois called . - Leave a message ? - Nope . - Can you call her back ? - Sure . Lois ? I 'm fine , thank you . How are you ? Whatever you wanna fix is fine . Oh , that sounds good . I won 't be late . Okay , bye . - Why did jack quit the regular force ? - Why 'd he quit , marvin ? What 'd he tell you ? Because of vertigo , but i don 't believe him . Well , it 's true , in a way . A few years back , jack was chasing this guy . Bad guy . The guy ran into a building that was under construction . Jack freaked out , started sweating . Couldn 't follow him . The guy got away . So a guy got away . Later that night that same guy killed six people . A family up in ridgemont . - But that isn 't jack 's fault . - Yeah , i know . He can 't blame himself for that . Yeah , well , he does . It 's always on his mind . The guy that got away that jack let get away . He never wants to let anybody get away from him again . Is that why he 's a robot expert ? I think he feels a lot safer doing this work . Now , why do you do what you do ? Oh , long story . I was gonna be a dancer but i hurt my knee . Then i was gonna be a data programmer but i didn 't like sitting down . Then i started ... runaway 2 , we have a 709 alert . - To the police academy . Runaway 2 , we have a 709 alert . Runaway 2 , runaway 2 , we have a 709 at fifth and sumter . What 's a 709 ? It means people have died . Oh , god ! - Hey , jack . - What 's up ? A model 912 cut up two people inside , wife and her sister . Bodies are over here . They managed to run out before they died . - Anything else ? - There 's a 10-month-old kid inside . - Dead ? - No . The kid 's in a crib . Maybe that 's why , but it hasn 't touched the kid yet . - We gotta save that kid , jack . - Tell me . What was the weapon ? Pathologist said it was probably an ordinary kitchen knife . We kept them for you to see . Let 's get them out of here , or they 'll be on the news . What 've you done ? Power cut , white light bath , white sound bath . - Floater ? - No . - Can you prep one for me ? - Right now . What have you got on the 912 ? It 's a new domestic model . Does housework , cooks meals , answers doors . - Run on house current ? - Batteries . What kind of sensors ? Sees and hears everything . Great . - Is it standard ? - May be modified . Anytime you change them , who knows how they 'll behave ? The father 's over there . Electronic engineer , name of johnson . - You got that floater yet ? - We 're programming it now . We 'd like a direct feed off your floater . - That 's impossible . - The public has a right to know . We got a 10-month-old baby in there . The rest of the family 's been cut up and we don 't know if the 912 will attack the child . I 'm sure you don 't want a carved-up baby on your network . We can be the judge of what 's newsworthy . Yeah , i know . Not tonight . The first confirmation from sgt . Ramsay of runaway that there is a baby inside , still alive . Police are preparing a floater camera to enter the house to locate the runaway 912 and the infant . I can 't see . Lights on in the house . Hit the house lights . - Where 's the baby ? - In the playroom , near the back . How big 's this 912 , anyway ? About the size of a hatbox . - Look . - It dropped the knife . Maybe the battery power 's fading . Maybe . - You get an audio ? - Confirmed as a.357 magnum . - The bastard 's got a gun . - Now what ? - I 'm going in . - We can send a disarm robot in . It hit the floater , it 'll hit the disarm , and it 'll hit the kid . I want light lines out here . No audio , no radio , no nothing . I don 't want it to know what we 're doing . Mr. Johnson ? Mr. Johnson ? I 'll be going in your house soon to get your baby . What modifications were made to the robot ? I didn 't make any modifications . I didn 't touch that thing . Then why has it gone out of control ? Well , how should i know ? You think i should have some idea why it 's doing this ? Take it easy . I 'm just asking . Well , don 't ask ! I don 't know ! What about the gun ? It 's got a gun ? - Oh , my god , he 's crazy . - Who 's crazy ? - My god , he 's crazy . - Who 's crazy ? No television ! No pictures ! I won 't be on television ! No pictures ! No television ! What was his problem ? Yeah , he was really upset . That was very hot stuff . Sgt. Ramsay is wearing his electromagnetic scatter suit . He apparently is going in . What is your next move now ? I really can 't say . It looks as if you 're going in after the robot . You 're broadcasting on an electromagnetic frequency that the robot reads . Let 's get out of here , john . This is exciting . Our own john wilson is accompanying sgt . Ramsay into the house for exciting live coverage of the runaway robot . I 'm coming out with the kid . It 's all right , darling . You okay ? Yeah , i 'm fine . Here you go . Where 's the father ? He disappeared . He disappeared ? With his own kid still in there ? After two tense hours and the tragic death of a kbex cameraman it was all over when sgt . Ramsay ... hello ? That was great ! See , they 're running it again . You 're on instant replay ! Hi , guy . Bobby , this is karen . - You 're his new partner . - Nice to meet you , bobby . I saw you on tv too , but you didn 't go in the house . Wow ! It was neat when dad went in there . I 'll bet you wished you could go in there too , huh ? It was pretty scary . I watched the whole thing . How come the father ran away ? Didn 't he wanna see his baby safe ? We were talking about that . It seems pretty funny to me . I think you should ... when you hear the tone , the time will be 10 : 45 which is exactly one hour and 45 minutes past your bedtime . Aw , lois ! This is a weeknight . Tomorrow is a school day . - I know , lois , but ... - hey , bobby . Lois is right . To bed . - Nice meeting you . - You too . - Do you like sports ? - Sure . Bobby , bed . - Good night , dad . - Good night . Good night , bobby . He is adorable . - How about a beer ? - Got anything diet ? Soda ? I will verify that bobby brushes his teeth . Excuse me . So that 's lois . I thought lois was your wife . Sometimes she thinks she is . Or my mother . Do you have a wife ? She died . Sorry , i didn 't know . It was a couple of years ago . A car crash . But lois is a big help . What is she , a series 10 ? No , a series 12 . Series 12s are much better . A lot of the series 10s were lemons . My mom had a series 10 that kept burning toast . Started fires . - Lois is pretty reliable . - Bobby is eating a chocolate bar . His dinner , too , was nutritionally inadequate . - What did you give him ? - Hot dogs . - You can 't keep giving him hot dogs . - It is all he would accept . - Did he do his homework ? - Yes , he got an a in math today . - Will your guest be staying for dinner ? - Me ? - You 're welcome if you 'd like . - You are welcome if you would like . No , thank you . - It 's no trouble . - It is no trouble . - Lois , i was talking to her . - Excuse me . - Actually , i better go . - You sure ? Thanks for the juice . May i show you out ? That 's okay , lois . I can find my way . Well , see you tomorrow . - Will i see you tomorrow ? - Lois , she was talking to me . Excuse me , sergeant . I 'll see you tomorrow . - Good night . - Good night . Is that someone to be put in memory ? Yes . She 's my new partner . - How should she be listed ? - As karen . Or officer thompson . Very well . There is a power surge from bobby 's room . I 'll handle it . The next dinosaur giant is brontosaurus , " thunder lizard . " Like the other two giants , she 's a peace-loving plant-eater . She is not as heavy as the brachiosaurus , but she does ... come on , tiger . Lights out . Is she still here ? No , she 's gone home . She 's nice . Do you like her ? Well , sure , i like her . She 's my partner . Does she have a husband ? I don 't know . She didn 't have a ring on . You noticed , huh ? It wouldn 't kill you to marry again . I know , and it wouldn 't kill you to go to sleep . Come on , tiger . - Hey , dad ? - What ? Were you really scared in there ? Sure i was . Was there blood and stuff like that ? Were you really scared ? Me ? Not me . Not even just a little ? Well , a little . That 's okay . - But everything is fine now . - That 's right . Everything 's fine . Good night , son . Would lois ever go crazy like that other robot ? No , never . Sleep now . Good night . Dinner is served . This concludes the menu for today . Reminder : I have not received the menu for tomorrow . Captain mcnichol , emergency phone call . - Son of a bitch ! - What is it ? We got a nonstandard chip here . See that red stripe ? It 's not a commercial chip . It didn 't come with the robot . Damn sophisticated , though . Maybe it 's experimental . - What 's it do ? - Looks like hard-wired instructions . - I 'm not sure . - So the 912 was modified . - Definitely . - That guy said it wasn 't modified . Maybe somebody else did it , and he didn 't know . - We got a dense pack ! Floor ! - Floor ! Assholes . There is a high level of smoke in the room . Please be careful . What was that ? Monodichromate dense pack the arson special . What the hell is this all about ? I don 't know . This isn 't a runaway . This is murder . Jack , you got a call . You 're gonna love it . Great . He said you were gonna love it . Come on , this way , guys . Careful . You have a lot of robots here . This is nothing . You should see the construction project over on main . There aren 't any people working there at all , just hundreds of robots . No coffee breaks , no union hassles . So what 's the problem ? Stacker . Gone nuts ! It 's stacking where there 's no place to stack . It 's on the 18th floor . Come on , i 'll show you . Have one of your people shut it off . Our insurance doesn 't cover it . Looks pretty open . Robots don 't need doors . Come on . How about i take this one ? Yeah , i think this one 's all yours . No problem . I worked construction at one time . Of course . I 'm on the 18th floor . It 's pretty windy up here . I can see the stacker now . We 're looking for ... i found the junction box but can 't find the switch . I got it ! No problem ! I turned it off ! Jack , do you read me ? I got it ! Think it 's better than it was when people did all this work ? Sure . But machines always break down . I 'll tell you how it is . Nothing works right . Relationships and people don 't work right . People make machines , so why should machines be perfect ? Because they 're machines . Well , that 's not the way it is . - Hi , sally . - Hi , jack . - How 's the new car ? - It 's in the shop . You 're kidding . Did you check the door recorder ? No , not yet . - Is it clean in here ? - Yeah , it 's clean . Hi , mary . It 's sally . I guess you 're not home . I came by to see if you wanted to go to that ceramics class . Call me when you get in . Bye . Hi , dave ? I 'm a little nervous about our project and ... meet me at the office , will you ? It 's important . Really . This is acme robot repairs . We got a call that one of your 912s was not functioning , and i 'm ... it 's been erased . Yeah , but not completely . This is acme robot repairs . We got a call that one of your 912s was not functioning , and i 'm ... i wanna know who this guy is . Beautiful . Just beautiful . I 'm glad you 're satisfied . Satisfied ? I 'm delighted . I 'm ecstatic . That 's good . Good ! Where are the chips ? Be very careful with these chips , dr . Luther . They 're very dangerous . I know . That 's why they 're so valuable . Valuable to whom ? The mafia , terrorist organizations , foreign agents . Anyone who 'll offer me the most money . Well , then how about my money ? Harry these aren 't all the chips . And where are the templates to make more ? The rest of the chips and templates are locked in a safe . We 'll give you the key after johnson and i get paid . Have you seen johnson ? No . He didn 't come in today . It 's terrible , what happened to his family . It 's a tragedy . Would you like me to pay now , harry ? I really would . I thought so . I brought the money with me . Sentry , on rounds ! Dr. Luther ? Damned , evil son of a bitch ! - He 's still in there ? - Came an hour ago . I bet he 's the only electrical engineer there . - What room ? - 404. fourth floor . Coffee , black . Keep an eye on the elevator . Police ! Drop it , johnson ! Now ! You are the cops . Who were you expecting ? Nobody . You got a suitcase packed . You got an alarm and a gun . You got a permit for this ? Come on . What are you gonna do ? Take you to the station for questioning . Sorry . Is this about the robot ? Yeah , it 's about the robot . Come on . - I can 't go out there . - Why not ? - I can 't go ! - Sure you can . I can 't go out ... ! Dispatch , this is runaway 2 ! What the hell are you trying to do ? Come here . We 're the police ! He had different eyes , hm ? Is that him ? Face was narrower . The eyes were squintier . More like that ? Pretty close . That 's a lot like him . That 's good . Jesus ! It 's picking up diphenyl compounds and tetrahydrocarbons . Tetras are explosive and diphenyls are solid propellant like they use in rockets . How big did you say these missiles were ? About that big . And they went around corners ? Who was this guy ? His name 's johnson , electronic engineer . - Where did he work ? - A company called vectrocon . Welcome to vectrocon security systems . A retinal identification check is required to proceed . Retinal identification is now being carried out . Thank you for your cooperation . Retinal identification is now confirmed . How can we help you ? I need data files . Data files for what person ? Employee david johnson . One moment . I will search the records . That 's a pretty good voice . What is it , a 5590 ? Yeah , it 's a 5590 processor , but with a z-77 phonetic rom . Gives it that lifelike tone . Thank you for waiting . David " dave " johnson is 32 years old . He has been with the company four years . A graduate in electronic engineering . He has worked on several projects : The vectrocon security system , the phantom missile and a laser-guided smart bomb . For the past year , he has worked in special projects . Dave enjoys skiing , biking and water sports . - It 's a standard pr bio . - What 'd you expect ? - It 's no good to me . - It 's what you requested . What do you wanna know ? This vectrocon security project . What about that ? - That information is classified . - Keep quiet . - Do you wish to disconnect ? - How do i find out ? - We have a call . - Have another unit take it . Yeah , but our call is right here . - On my way . - In this building ? You wanna handle this ? It seems like we got a runaway . All right ! Hello ? Anybody there ? Who is she ? Jackie rogers , one of the executive secretaries . Hello ? Can anybody hear me ? ! We hear you , miss rogers . This is sergeant ramsay . Will you guys get me out ? This damn robot won 't let me pass . He 's zapped me twice . Can you see that ? You just sit tight , miss rogers . She 's very attractive . - Should she be in there ? - Maybe she 's working late . Let 's see the runaway . A 577 sentry ? Yeah , 577 with office-checking routines onboard . Got it . Insulated wheels , steel hull . - Delivers taser shocks only ? - Standard issue . We don 't modify them . We run them as they come . Supposed to voice-inactivate with a code . Do you know the code ? Sentry . Input . Vetro . Zip off . 891. clipper . I 've already tried that . It isn 't responding . With these sentries , the temperatures get too high and they pop their chips right off the motherboard . Would you guys please do something ? All this thing can do is deliver shocks ? What level ? Sting level only . Irritating , but it can hurt . No bio , cardiac , nothing . Want me to get the insulation and padding ? - Are you sure ? - I 'll knock this baby off quick . Miss rogers , this is sergeant ramsay . I 'll be right with you . You just sit tight . Thank you . I thought you got armed before you went up against a runaway . I think he 's in love . You just stay put , miss rogers . This will only take a minute . Better watch out for him . I think i know what i 'm doing . It 's set for stun , not sting level . I noticed . - Want the padding now ? - No . Are you all right , sergeant ? I 'm fine . - Is this the way you usually do it ? - Sure . What are you doing ? You didn 't have to do that ! Judgment call . It was a new jacket . Yeah , but the sentry 's ruined . I 'll have to report this . If i find there 's any irregularities we 'll shut down all your machinery as hazardous for 60 days . - Are you okay , miss rogers ? - I 'm fine . - I 'll just see you to the door . - No , it 's fine . - I insist . - You 've done enough . It 's my duty . Here you are working late all by yourself . - I just had to finish up . - I insist . - Let me help you . - No , really ... - what 's this ? - It 's not my fault . - He made me get them from the vault . - Who ? Luther . They 're his chips ! I don 't have anything to do with this . He said he would kill me if i didn 't get them tonight ! He would kill me the way he killed johnson and the others . He 's evil , i 'm telling you ! Where 's this luther now ? - A meeting . - What meeting ? - I don 't know ! I 'm not involved ... - where is he ? ! The ritz hotel . Ritz hotel . The presidential suite . Two guys with him and two girls . They 've got an evs scrambler on , so we can 't hear or see shit . Where exactly are they ? Can 't determine where without a probe , and they 'll pick that up . - You using passives only ? - Passives only . - All the exits and elevators covered ? - We don 't have enough people . This guy 's a killer . I 'm not gonna let him get away . Something 's going on in there . - I better go in . - You taking responsibility ? You okay about this ? - Yeah , fine . - You sure ? It 's more interesting than traffic . I 'm gonna go in first and when you hear me you come in . Honey , did i leave my purse out there ? Did i leave my purse out there or not ? Are you listening to me ? He 's not even there . Don 't shoot , please . Please don 't shoot . Come on , now . Nobody move . Nobody move . Just stay cool . Everything 's gonna be fine . You said there wouldn 't be trouble . Nobody move . Right here . Okay , let 's take it easy . Everybody move real slow , and we won 't have any trouble . Drop it , sucker . I said , " drop your gun . " I 'm not kidding , asshole . Drop your gun . Please . Now kiss your ass goodbye ! Police ! Hold it ! I 'm okay . Get him . - Where ? - The stairs ! Officer down , inside . Call for backup . They 're on the roof ! It 's all right . It 's all right . You 're okay . The coroner 's office has authorized the removal of the bodies . - Come on . - She 's a witness , billy . - Sergeant , may we have a word with you ? - Go away . Later . I want to talk to you . Chief , any further comment ? No , there 's no comment right now . - How is it , kid ? - Fine . Didn 't even break any bones . I 'm going to the hospital . They 'll take the bullet out there . Take it out there ? That 's right , in case she starts bleeding . But you can 't move her . Hold on a minute . Come here . Take a look at that screen again . That 's not a bullet . It 's an unexploded microshell . It can go off anytime . - It can blow her whole arm off ... - that 's right . You gotta take it out here . Don 't move her . - The chief wants your ass . - I know . Just sit tight . It 's gonna be fine . I 'm trying not to breathe . You do that . Look at this . Look . Those two dead hoods ? We got a make off the prints . Tommy aracaro , degree in electrical engineering , cal tech . - Great . - And luigi bandini , degree in solid state physics , m.i.t. These guys are high-tech shoppers . But what are they buying ? Good question . Now , ramsay ! Get over here , ramsay . - Who the hell do you think you are ? - It 's my operation . It 's a runaway operation ? No runaways in that room . You screwed up good . We 've got two dead officers , understand ? Two dead cops ! Two wounded , one of them your own partner . We got two dead guinea punks ! And nobody knows what it 's all about ! I know what it 's about . It 's about this . What is this ? It 's some kind of new bullet , like a guided missile . It can go ... what the hell is this ? ! Disarm robot . There 's an unexploded fragment . You can 't use that thing on her ! - They sent for it . - They screw up all the time . - We have to . It 's a live shell . - It 'll screw up ! It 'll blow her arm off . - Can 't you get a cvd ? - There 's none available . It 's over a year old and , they were never any good ! Jesus christ , you 've got nerve to complain ! Haven 't you done enough for one day ? - I 'll get the bullet out . - You ? I 'll disarm the goddamn bullet . Get it out of here ! All right , clear out . We 've got a disarm job . Clear out ! Can you get them to clear out ? I want tensolite shields ! I want blast pads ! I want to clear the fucking room now ! Ramsay ! You 're on television . I don 't give a shit . Get that thing out of my face . Get out . Clear it out ! Ladies , i 'll give you a statement down here . Let 's go . Get out ! Yes , i will give the public a statement . What 's this ? Remote tv . Of course . Okay , guys , let 's clear out . Better get away from the door . - How we doing , kid ? - Okay . I heard the news . Well , don 't sweat it . You don 't have to do this . Yeah , i know . - You can let the robot do it . - I wouldn 't miss this for the world . Just hold real still . - Too tight ? - No , it 's okay . I want you to sit back and take it real easy . It 'll hurt like a mother . Just real easy . Just turn your arm . Real slow . That 's it . That 's good . Okay , whatever you do don 't move your arm . I 'll try and remember . Don 't you need your glasses for this ? Want me to run to the car and get them ? Breathe it , kid . Hold still ! Come on kid , breathe it . That 's it . Just keep breathing . Hold still . That 's it . Come on , kid . Breathe it . That 's it . Easy . - Did you get it ? - Not yet . Can 't you do anything right ? I 'm doing the best i can . This thing 's gonna be okay . Heard any jokes lately ? Come on , kid . Hold on . Come on , hold still . Breathe it . I can see it . Come on . I can see it . It 's almost there . Come on . There ! It 's okay . You didn 't need to wait , jack . I 'm fine . - I was worried about you . - I 'm fine , really . - Hurt much ? - No . Not really . Bet it does . Jack , i 'm fine . Why don 't we have dinner tonight ? Dinner ? Sure . I gotta go home and change , though . - You can go like that . - I can 't go like this . We 're going to my place . - We should get to know each other . - I love it . It 's a good idea for partners to spend time together away from work . - Definitely . You 're right . We 'll go over office routines station procedures . There 's a lot of things you 'll need to know . The chief isn 't the easiest guy to get along with . I always take new partners to dinner . Oh , you do ? Just because you 're a woman shouldn 't make any difference , right ? Well , listen , i really appreciate the gesture but i want to go home . - Why not dinner ? Just forget it . The pasta will be al dente in two minutes 17 seconds . Forget it , lois . - Where 's your dinner guest ? - Forget it . She forget it ? She didn 't forget it . I 'm asking you to forget it . Very well , i will erase it from memory . You do that . Bobby stayed up to say good night to you . Dad . Hi , son . I saw you on tv . I know you didn 't mean it . - Mean what ? - What you said . The words that you said that you say i can 't say . - Well , you see ... - i know . You didn 't know what you were saying , because you were worried about her . Well , that 's true . But that 's not an excuse . - Sometimes ... - just don 't let it happen again . I 'll try . Did she come here tonight ? No , she went home . Excuse me , sergeant . They want you at the police station . I gotta go . You go to sleep . - Good night , son . - Yes , sir . Good night . Vehicle recovery on three-six . Look at this . The back half is solid propellant . There 's directional control . The nose is electronic . You 've heard of a bullet that has your name on it ? This one really does . - You can program it . - What 's its signature ? I don 't know . I 've tried everything . Movement , light , shape . - I gotta know , marvin . - I know ! I 'm doing my best , okay ? It 's tricky . Heat . My god . - A heat-seeking missile . - They come at a specific person . Sure . Everyone 's body has its own unique heat pattern . This is yours and this is mine . Clean , simple and neat . This is a police nightmare . We used to worry about terrorists getting a-bombs ? The real problem is microelectronics stuff . I mean , a smart bullet ? What about these chips ? Overrides all cpu instructions . Turn any computer into a killer . Charles luther . This the guy ? Yeah , that 's him . This is a bad guy . Served one to three , robbery . Arrest , murder two , no conviction . Arrest for assault with a deadly weapon , overturned . Mob connections . He 's a rich kid gone bad . Why 's he with johnson ? He got johnson and harry to design the chips , killed them and ran away with the stuff . He likes to kill people . He 's killed five so far . I want him . I 'm sure you do . But how are you going to get him ? We 've got his girlfriend . Whoop-dee-do ! You think he 's interested in a piece of ass ? - She 's all we 've got . - And she leads nowhere . I want you to talk to our psychic . Linda 's in the building . I 'll send her up here to give you a reading . - Come on , chief . - Just do it , ramsay . Louis ... an old name . Lucifer . Luther ? Is his name luther ? And you 're looking for him . He 's very angry . Where is he ? I 'm not surprised you 're looking for him . You have a karmic bond . You were brothers in another life . - Linda ... - your relationship is clear , like pieces in the same puzzle . You 've been close many times , and you 'll get closer . You 'll definitely meet . When and where ? He 'll see to that . After all you have what he wants . - I do ? - Of course . - I work as an exercise instructor . - Where ? A lot of places . Look , i got a firm body . My body 's perfect . It 's like a rock . I can see that . Oh , come on . He 's giving me a hard time . - He doesn 't believe me . - I can 't help . Weiner-head ! Officer milhop , artist sketch room . Called you back too , huh ? How are you feeling now ? Hurts , but it 's okay . - Hey , ramsay . Telephone . - I 'm not here . What 's going on ?

 MORK : Na-no , na-no . Ripped By mstoll [ IN SOUTHERN ACCENT ] I feel so nauseous . Oh , my stomach feels like cat drool on a dog lip . Yes , this seltzer shall be the eraser on the blackboard of life . It shall help . Why am I talking like a character in a Tennessee Williams ' play ? I don 't know . It doesn 't matter . Here . Here I go . [ IN NORMAL VOICE ] Wow , what a head rush ! For sure . Oh , more tiny bubbles than a Don Ho medley . Morning . Little hugger squash . - Happy one-month anniversary to you . - Oh . What do you give someone for their one-month anniversary ? Styrofoam . That 's why I bought you a boogie board . That 's romantic . Well , I have a little surprise for you . The Hammond family is doing a TV special in Boulder , and I 'll cover the dress rehearsal . I thought you might wanna come with me . The Hammond family ? Oh , Mind , the All-American Hammonds ? Oh , Mind . I especially love Donna and Mario . They 're my favorite . Oh , Mind , that 's wonderful . That ... Pass . Pass ? But , Mork , it 's our anniversary . I mean , I know , but I 've got millions of things to do , and I have to send a condolence card to Morris , the cat 's mother . At least come down and have lunch with me . I said I was busy ! - Whoa . Aren 't we snippy today . - Mind , I 'm sorry . You know how I get before the opening of trout season . We 'll have a lovely dinner tonight , won 't we , hon ? Maybe ? - Okay , I accept your apology . - Aw . I gotta run . Well , I 'll see you after work . Bye . - Big kiss . Bye . - Bye , little " pooter . " [ GROANING ] Oh , what a performance . My stomach feels like it has a Greek Orthodox wedding going on in it . [ EXIDOR MIMICKING SIREN WAILING ] Doctor , is that you ? Patient ! Is that you ? Mork , I 'm glad you called . I don 't ordinarily make house calls . I had to make an exception in this case . I don 't have an office . Exidor , I don 't feel very well . I 'm ... Go no further . First I need you to sign this waiver . It clears me of any wrongdoing in the event of death or permanent disability resulting from my total ignorance of the medical profession . But you 're a doctor . The only reason I became a doctor was to get MD plates , so I could park in front of Bloomingdale 's . Oh , moment , open your mouth wide . Nurse Ryan , will you come in , please ? What are you gawking at ? Haven 't you ever seen a naked man before ? Hmm . Three fifteen , that 's a tad high , Mork . It 'd be perfect if I were a rump roast . Exidor , do something just as long as I don 't have to have anything shaved . Relax . You better turn your head . This might hurt a little . [ MORK YELPS ] Damn , I 'm good ! Exidor , I feel strange and wonderful . I feel kind of achy and ... I mean ... I have cravings for , like , Teflon bananas . I feel kind of queasy and short-tempered ! What is it ? What is it ? Well , either you 're turning into Billy Martin , or you 're pregnant . - That 's ... - That 's ... That 's it . I 'm preggers . I 've got a bun in the oven . Nonsense ! And that 's me saying it . Wait , wait . No , no , no ! You don 't understand . You really don 't understand . You see , I think I really am pregnant . I could be pregnant . You see , an Orkan and an Earthling have never mated before . It 's possible . You know , if it is , it 's a miracle . Every patient thinks that their case is special . All right , come into my consultation room . We 'll talk it over . Just sit here . I feel so weak in the knees . Mork ... I 'm pregnant , I 'm really pregnant . Oh , I can 't wait to tell Mindy and Omni magazine . Mork , as your personal physician and doubles partner , I suggest that you break it to your wife gently . And work on that serve . Oh . [ GRUNTS ] I just felt a sharp pain , Exidor . Another one too . What does it mean ? Well , it means you 're in labor and I 'm playing singles . [ GRUNTING ] [ PANTING ] [ GRUNTING ] My little bundle of joy . Oh , look . My little bundle 's here . Oh , say hello to the world . I don 't know if it 's a boy or a girl . We won 't know till it hatches . Oh , that 's wonderful . And look , I have a navel . That 's wonderful . And no stretch marks either . Hello , little " nooter . " I 'm a mother , and I 'm gonna give you everything except an Oedipus complex . And I can read Harlequin books now , and stay up all night for no reason . Yay ! Come on now . Smile . Say , " Cheez Whiz . " There you go . A picture of you and mom . Oh , boy , Mindy is really gonna love you . That is , if I get up the nerve to tell her that you were born . MINDY : Hi , Mork , I 'm home . - Nap time . Here we go . Hi . Well , I 've got this great idea . How to make our one-month anniversary even better than our three-week anniversary . Wanna hear it ? You can 't really top Andy Warhol 's 3D Hamlet . " Oh , what a rogue and peasant slave am I. " Interesting . Well , we 're gonna get all dressed up , and we 're gonna go out and do something we 've never done before . That 's fine . Put on your prom dress and I 'll put on my Mr. Peanut outfit . Then we can have a very candid , sober discussion about family . Oh , Mork , I wanna go out and do something romantic . Like , I wanna go ride the carousel , or ... I know . Let 's put on warm clothes , go out and make angels in the snow like in Love Story . The sad thing about that movie was that she became an angel before she ever had a family . You know what 's making a big romantic comeback ? - The family unit . - Don 't talk to me about family units . I just spent the whole day with the Hammond family , all nine of them . Come on , Mork , let 's just go out , you and me . I mean , we 're young , we 're in love , we 're newlyweds . You 're absolutely right , Mind . Maybe we should have a little tête-à-tête and then sit and talk . What 's wrong with going out and having some good old-fashioned fun ? We could talk in Latin if you want . [ SPEAKS IN LATIN ] Mork ... Mind , Mind . Mind , Mind , how can we lead such frivolous lives ? I mean , when you consider what 's going on in the world today . I mean , trouble in El Salvador , cruise missiles . I mean , bad line-calls against John McEnroe . And the family . Why do you keep bringing up family ? I 'd like to have one , Mind . Right now . Look , Mork . I wanna have a family someday just as badly as you do . But a family is something you plan for . We 're just starting out . We 're not really ready emotionally or financially . My gosh , my career 's just getting off the ground , and yours ... Well , this is America . Mork , if we had a baby right now , it wouldn 't be fair to the child in the long run . Maybe down the road a bit . Now , let 's just go out , you and me , - for a good time . - You don 't understand . Time is of the essence . Pakistan has the bomb and all they have to do is roll it down the hill . Mork , we just got married . It 's the time for the two of us , so let 's work on that a while , all right ? Now , I 'm gonna go get changed , and we 're gonna go have a nice candlelight dinner . And then maybe go for a sleigh ride . Okay ? And then maybe come home and thaw each other out . There 's gotta be some way we can get you and Mindy together . Too bad it 's not Easter , huh ? MINDY : Do you know what time it is ? MORK : I swear I heard somebody . I didn 't hear anything . [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] - There it is again . - Who could it be at this hour ? Maybe it 's a Jehovah 's Witness with the Watchtower with the late scores . There 's nobody there . Good night . It might be Claude Rains , Mind . Good night . Hey , you ! Come back here ! [ IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE ] No , mister , take good care of him . [ IN NORMAL VOICE ] Look . Mind , somebody left a baby on our doorstep . Somebody would leave a ... A baby ? It 's just an egg . Just an egg , Mind ? Shouldn 't we not be prejudiced ? Look . There 's a note down here too . " I have left my child because I know you 'll take good care of it . You are good , kind , understanding people , especially you , Mindy . " Let 's see , it 's about 2 : 30 a.m. Yeah , I think that 's a good time for an explanation . All right , Mind , this is merely conjecture , but I 'll give it a try . A poor , unwed mother is cast out of Boston by her WASP parents . " Muffy , Tad and I believe that you have to leave , but we packed your few Lacoste shirts and your penny loafers . " She wanders around Boston , selling her own hair and a few Springsteen tickets to raise enough money to buy milk for her child . That 's real ... That 's real interesting , Mork . Now , how about the truth ? The truth is , Mind , that she was an unwed mother from Thailand whose Buddhist parents said , " Bung How , you have forgot your mantra for the last time . " The truth . Okay , you want the truth , I 'll give you the truth , vérité . In your hand you are holding our child . Okay . Enough for tonight . It 's going back in the refrigerator . Mind , Mind , Mind ! The world is cold enough as it is . Daddy didn 't mean that . Mork , this would be one of your better jokes , except men don 't have babies , and for sure they can 't lay eggs . Mind , Mind , Mind . You know that I am a test-tube child without a navel . And look , wait a minute , let me show you here . What 's that ? See , Mind , I 'm telling you the truth . I 'm not lying . What ? Wait a minute . Well , you mean ... No . You mean , you and I ... ? When ... And I ? And then you ... ? And here it is ? You should work for Reader 's Digest , Mind . No , no , no . No , no . Oh , no . No , I have to sit down . Oh , no . All right , assuming that I am not dreaming and that is our child , what is that gonna be ? I don 't know , but he 's gonna have his own affirmative action program . I don 't think there 's anything that has happened to me in my life that could possibly prepare me for the fact that that is our child . Not even all the Twilight Zones I 've watched . Mind , you told me it wasn 't the right time , so I tried to find other parents for it , and then I realized the best parents in the whole world would be you and I. Mind , we 'd love this . I mean , can we keep him ? Can we , Mindy ? Can we ? Well , of course we 'll keep it , Mork . I mean , I 'd love anything you and I made together . Mind , you weren 't too crazy about that bookcase . That was different . Oh , Mind , at last we have someone we can cherish and have someone who can test our will . I mean , someone that we can put medication out of reach of . Mind , is something wrong ? Why would you say that ? Well , I 've never seen anyone grit their back before . Yo , there we go ! No , everything 's great . Mind , you 're not really too convincing in that . You sound like Nancy Reagan saying she doesn 't spend a lot of money on new dishes . Oh , I don 't know , Mork . It 's just that I had this insane idea that when you and I decided to plan a family , I would be the one who had the baby . I don 't know , I ... Maybe I was ... I looked forward to knowing that there was a baby inside , and craving strange foods and getting fat , and not being able to see my feet . Oh , Mind , come on now . Just because you 're not the mother , doesn 't mean that it doesn 't need your love . - Oh , I know , Mork . - Oh , Mind , Mind , Mind . Come on , you 're gonna be the prettiest , softest father a kid ever had . Thanks . I just ... I just need some time to get used to this . It 's just pretty strange . Mind . L ... - I think you 'd better hurry , Mind . - Why ? Because our child is growing faster than a Russian athlete on steroids . Oh , Mork . [ GASPS ] Didn 't know I could knit , huh ? It 's amazing with a little love how much you can grow . What is in that egg ? I don 't know , Mind , but I hope it 's healthy . I just wanna know if it 's a boy , girl or pterodactyl . Pterodactyls are nice , but they 're hard to potty-train once they 're airborne , you know . Oh , Mork . How can you be so calm ? Don 't you think that thing is a little gigantic ? Well , some people show more than others , Mind . - When do you think it 's gonna arrive ? - Well , by the look , about 24 hours . [ GASPS ] Twenty-four hours ! But humans get nine months . Elephants get two years . I get 24 hours ? It takes longer than that to get Peking duck . [ EGG BANGS ] Boy , he can sure kick , Mind . Are you related to Bruce Lee ? I guess there 's not much for me to do at this birth . Come on now . You 've gotta be a parent too . Now , come over here and touch it . Now just pat it . You know , put your arms around it . Have you hugged your egg today ? - Oh , Mork , I feel silly . - You should . I told you to hug an egg . Come on , come on , come on . - It 's nice and warm . - It should be . I sat on it all night . - I can hear a heartbeat . - Why don 't you talk to it ? Oh , I don 't think so . Oh , come on now , Mind . You talk to your plants including that wandering jew . " Where are we today ? I don 't know . " Hello . This is Mindy , your mother . Uh , your father . One of your parents . I feel like Shari Lewis without Lamb Chop . Mind , isn 't it wonderful ? We 're parents now . We get to say things like , " Don 't put that in your mouth ! You don 't know where it 's been ! " That 's true . Mind , have you thought of a name yet ? Well , yeah . I 'd kind of like to name it Beth , after my mother . If it 's a girl . And it doesn 't have wings . I have a certain sentimental attachment ... Attachment to a name if it 's a boy . - What 's that ? - Rodan . - No , I don 't think so . - Oh , a little too ethnic ? Well , how about Jennifer , or maybe Mustafa Joaquin ? Oh , Mork , how are we gonna explain to people that you laid an egg , and we hatched a baby ? And only after one month of marriage ? We 'll tell them we had to get married . I 've been thinking about this and I think we should keep this our little secret . - Mind , are you ashamed of our child ? - Oh , no . No , Mork , but what if somebody found out it was part alien ? Who knows what they 'd do to it ? And then they 'd find out you 're an alien and who knows what they 'd do to you ? [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] Federales ! Federales ! Shh . Who is it ? BICKLEY : A sad and desperate man . - Oh , no , it 's Mr. Bickley . Uh ... Uh , we 'll be right there . We 're not decent . BICKLEY : I don 't wanna see you . I wanna talk to you . - What do we do ? - The bedroom . No , not now . We have company , Mind . - I meant the egg . - I know that . I was trying to give a little comic relief in these moments of tension . Easy , easy , gentle , gentle . - Mind , Mind , Mind . - Uh , we 'll be right there . Be careful . MINDY : Uh-oh . Oh , no . Why do I feel like we 're at a company picnic on Saturn , Mind ? I 'm counting to five . Open the door , or I 'm climbing into the trash compactor . - I think it 's beginning to crack . - Oh , Mind , I 'll stay here with the egg . I think it 's almost time now . I hope all this rolling around hasn 't turned him into a quiche . Look , I 'll get rid of Mr. Bickley . Hi , Mr. Bickley . - What a nice suit . - Thanks , I 'm about to be buried in it . Oh , Mr. Bickley , you dropped in at a bad time . - I was washing my hair . - Please , Mindy , - I don 't wanna talk about it . - Oh , then I respect your feelings . - Bye . - I met Dorinda at a Club Med luau . The second I laid eyes on her , I knew I had to make her mine . Sure , she was a lot younger than me , but she loved older men . Oh , it is a nice story , Mr. Bickley , but maybe you can tell me it tomorrow . Our romance blossomed , and we decided to get married . So last night I took her to meet Dad . That 's when the trouble started . - Oh , your father objected ? - No , she ran off with him . That 's too bad , Mr. Bickley . " Too bad " ? You call that pity ? Where 's Mork ? Oh , uh ... Uh , Mork 's in the bedroom having breakfast . [ EGG CRACKING ] Rice Krispies . Hi , Bick . Nice suit you got there . How 's life treating you ? It all started when I met Dorinda at a Club Med luau . She told me she loved ... What ? What is that noise ? Oh , I 'm just listening to my Exorcist soundtrack . Little Linda 's head is just starting to spin around . Mind , could you give me a little moral support and maybe a ball-peen hammer ? What 's going on in there that 's more important than me ? No ! You don 't wanna go in there . - It will only remind you of Dorinda . - Oh , you 're right . Everything does . I 'll never be able to look at my family album , or eat suckling pig again . Mr. Bickley , you 've got to know that those gray skies are gonna clear up . So put on a happy face and remember , there 's always more fish in the sea . But I want a girl just like the girl that ran off with dear old Dad . Mindy , I don 't wanna upset you , but I think there 's a great big nest over there . - What ? - Don 't you see it ? - Yes . - What is it ? It 's a great big nest . What the hell is it doing there ? Boy , is Mork gonna be upset . His pet condor got away . Why do I come here ? It 's going to happen . You don 't wanna miss this like you did Beverly Sills at Marineland . This is it , Mind . Isn 't it much nicer having the baby at home rather than in a hospital ? Now , it 's important that we don 't panic , and if we panic , it 's important we 're not loud . I just hope it 's healthy . I just hope it doesn 't eat the bedroom set . - I love you , Mind . - I love you too , Mork . It 's a boy . It 's a man ! Ripped By mstoll

 Sean ! Mike , take it easy . I 'm sorry . - ls it time ? - ln 20 minutes . - I dreamt they killed him . - Who , Sean ? Did you get any sleep ? I 'm all right . Let 's go . - Robert wants to see you in the lab . - Another lizard show . Sure got a lot of complaints . We 're wasting a lot of time with lab experiments . - Got any better ideas ? - We can 't create a super-weapon . Maybe manpower . I 'm telling you . Remember the group you spoke to ? We got volunteers . It 's gonna take more than manpower . It 'll take unity . You 're not big on unity , are you ? - I 'm used to working alone . - Well , get unused to it . We 're a team . - How 's our production ? - Right on schedule . All right . Let 's open it up . - Step down . Watch your step . - What 's this about ? It 's the middle of the night . Welcome to Visitor Orientation Center Number 9 . Please move quickly but safely inside . All your questions will be answered . We appreciate your cooperation . The cleansing spray is harmless , and for our protection only . - Have a pleasant visit . - Next . I followed them here the night they took my husband . Check your watch . - 12 : 18 . - Two minutes . My husband hid me . He saved my life . What is this place ? Jenny , stay here . Oh , my God ! It 's a processing plant . They 're shipping food ! We 're gonna close this supermarket down . Let 's go . - You miss him , and we 're lizard bait . - I won 't miss . - I 'll take those two . - Say when . Alert . We have an emergency . Hold the line . Let 's go ! Go ! Go ! Our bullets are just bouncing off ! Aim for the legs ! Aim for the legs ! Go back ! Let 's get out of here ! Get the wounded . She 's badly wounded . Go ! Go ! Start it up again . Start the line . Congratulations . Your security measures are quite effective . I should hope so . There 's no glory in rousting this rabble . Take the wounded to the infirmary . - Help ! - Come on . Easy . Keep her head up . Come on . Move the truck . Clear some tables off . We need some supplies . I need a splint over here . Come on , baby . Come on . Hang on . Where do you want him ? Bed number 2 . Get some fluids into him . Robin , clamp those bleeders . I don 't know how . Never mind , I 'll do it . Put an IV in that guy . - Where 's Father Andrew ? - He 's busy . - We 're all busy . - He 's giving last rites . Through this holy anointing , may the Lord pardon all your sins . In the name of the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit . Donovan . They mustn 't win . They can 't . They won 't . Promise me . I promise . All right . Let 's get her inside . Easy , now . I hit one and it didn 't faze him . Donovan 's laser weapon is the only one that works . It 's our only one . I hit one with an M-16 , all it did was knock him down . This defeat is gonna cost us ... - ... if we don 't turn it around . - What do you mean ? People would help if they thought there 's a chance . These hit-and-run raids are useless . We need a bonanza . We need an event . We ? Since when did you join up ? Never mind that . He 's right . What does a priest know about strategy ? The South African guerrillas taught me . Let 's just deal with what we can handle at the moment , to survive . We need supplies and a real doctor . I bet the Visitors look just like this . Don 't be stupid . Everybody knows they 're big reptiles . - They are not . - They are too . They 're not lizards . They are . They 're ugly , creepy lizards . Just like this . Stop it , Polly . - Give him a kiss . - Stop it ! Robin ! Why is your sister so upset ? I don 't know . I didn 't do anything . Polly 's just teasing . She 's frustrated like all of us . Kids tease and grownups get mean . Oh , baby . I wanna help . I wanna say the right thing . Tell me who the baby 's father is . Really , I just wanna help , that 's all . I know . I just don 't wanna have anything to do with him . It was just an accident . We 'll see this through together . Docking crew , prepare for arrival of Supreme Commander 's craft . Flight crew stand by for off-loading personnel . Security escort , report to Shuttlecraft 93 preparing for departure in Bay 6 . No , Diana , I don 't understand . You promised me an interview with the president over two months ago . I know , Kristine . The bureaucracy drives me crazy too . - Kristine , what a pleasant surprise ! - Good to see you , John . - Diana . - Welcome to Los Angeles . Kristine was requesting an interview with the U.S. president again . I thought my people had taken care of that . I 'll see to it myself . - ln the meantime , I bring good news . - Really ? You 'll have exclusive coverage of one of the most important announcements of a lifetime . Of all time . Thank you . I 'm quite grateful . Can you give me an idea of what it might be ? Soon , my dear . Very soon . We 'll keep you informed . In the meantime you will be accorded every hospitality . This event at the L.A. Medical Center will be the highlight of your career . Get down . It 's Lizard City . What 's going on ? Looks like Disneyland . Must be a convention . Let 's get our medical supplies and get out of here . You 'll coordinate surveillance with your commanding designated sectors . Breaches of security will be dealt with severely . My men are aware of that , Diana . All right . Move out . Well ! Looks like you got kicked upstairs . - I 'm youth leader now . - Good for you . Head of the L.A. chapter of Friends of The Visitors . Got security clearance . No kidding ? Pretty tough job . Lot of pressure . I got what you want . Little pop , keep you on top . Don 't get greedy in there , okay ? Never do . You should light the hallway . Diana placed us in the entourage . You can follow with a minicam . Dr. Walker ! Excuse me . Dr. Walker . Kristine Walsh . We met in Palm Springs . I 've been such an admirer ... I remember you , Ms. Walsh . You were a newswoman . I 'm still ... No , Ms. Walsh . You 're certainly not a newswoman . At best , a press secretary . At worst , a collaborator . I don 't know what you 've heard , but I 'm doing my job . I wonder how many times that phrase was used at the Nuremberg Trials . That is untrue . Ms. Walsh , I 'll tell you what is untrue . It is untrue you 're working for a benevolent regime . Fascists have take over , and you 're their administer of propaganda . You 've allowed personal ambition to corrupt you . You no longer have credibility . Good day . Dr. Kaufman to OR . Dr. Kaufman to OR , please . Gary , check out those wimps . Those are hot-shot intellectuals . They 'll probably graduate med school and marry sorority queens . Excuse me . I bet that you doctors operate on each other , right ? See , school 's a bunch of crap . Do you like me ? I don 't think he likes me . Kneel . - Kneel . - Get down there . Do as you 're told . That 's better . You look very comfortable , why don 't you stay there for a while ? And while you 're down there , why don 't you clean my boots ? No , no . Not that way . Lick them . Mousies . Mousies . Mousies ? I 'm looking for little mousies . Mousie ! What the hell are you doing ? Mousies . Don 't you ever be so stupid again . Humans must never see us eat ! Dr. Walker . We 've been waiting for you . - Don 't ask me again . - I can 't promise . It 's too dangerous . - lt 's not easy for us . - I 'm a doctor , not a fighter . We need doctors . We need you . I 'm scared . I 've got a family . What 's going on ? So many lizards . Nobody 's sure . There 's a rumor that John 's coming . You sure ? That 's what I heard . I want the plans to the hospital . I don 't know . - What do you mean ? - Well , medicine 's one thing ... Look , man , if we lose , the whole shooting match is lost . We 're all you got between the life you had and the one you 're not gonna have . I 'll see what I can do . Thank you . I trust you will have the president ready for the interview soon . It would be much easier if I were supervising the conversion . He 's tough , but he 'll be ours soon . It 's taking too long . Conversion can be a long and difficult process . Kristine is losing faith . It 's not as simple to tap their minds as it is their water resources . One mistake and our Dr. Walker will be a babbling idiot . Brian , this is incredible . I 've never known people who lived in places like this . Perhaps one day you will live like this . Yeah , I know I will . This way . ... Colorado River to supply all of California . In an exclusive interview recorded earlier today John , the Supreme Commander of the Visitors ... - She redefines the word smooth . - You mean slippery . Donovan 's the expert . I chose the Los Angeles Medical Center for my announcement . I don 't want to say much more at this time except that this announcement concerns a major medical breakthrough we 've made . A breakthrough that will relieve untold suffering on your planet . Our gift to you . This is it . This is the event Donovan 's talking about . It 's too big . Security will be maximum plus . - There will be a lot of heat . - Nobody said we 'd kick in the door . Are there passes for the center ? There are special passes issued at the last moment . - How special ? - Can you get one ? I don 't think so . I have limited access at Security Headquarters and Steven said that passes will be impossible to duplicate . Anything can be duplicated . If we can expose their Supreme Commander on national TV ... International . I mean , tear his phony face off right in front of the cameras we could turn this war around for good . - Mark , you 're a cop . - Ex-cop . - Elias , you 're a hood . - Ex-hood . You two should be able to find the best counterfeiter around . Pascal . - Dan Pascal ? - Yeah . If he 's still alive . Find him . We 'll try . Come on . Nobody moves ! All right , pick them up . Clear the street . Stay back . Move on . Move on . Let 's go . It 's all over now . Move on . Clear the area . This is police business . Clear the streets . Clear the area . Police business . - Martin ? - Yes . Where 's my son ? - ln Section 34 . We can 't get to him . - You 've got to . - You got a picture of him ? - I 'll get you one . What else do you need ? Weapons . Uniforms . Too risky . We have our own movement . Our network is spreading . We 're dying . If we lose you lose . We need each other . I can 't get you weapons . They 're all accounted for . Then get us uniforms . All right . I know what you 're up against . But I can 't jeopardize our movement . I want to help . But ... This could change the entire complexion of the war . What are you planning ? It 's better that you don 't know . Not yet . For your own safety . And for ours . I want my son back , Martin . This way . Kristine . Thank you for coming before your broadcast . I want you to meet your guest . Splendid . Who is it ? A very respected man in your country . And I 'm happy to say , a booster for us . I know how pleased he is to appear with you . Kristine Walsh , what a pleasure . We met once before , Gerald Ford 's home . We played bridge after golf . You made an impossible bid but you carried it off . Gave us quite a lesson . I do want to tell you what a wonderful job you 're doing . It 's so important that we have you ... Well , well , well . Hi . What 's going on here ? Heavy security stuff , very hush-hush . So how about it ? I don 't even know your name . I 'm Daniel . What 's yours ? - Maggie . - Hi . So how about what ? - Getting together . - lf you mean a date , okay . If you mean something more horizontal , no . At least not yet . Maggie 's made contact with Daniel . - We 've got a problem . - What problem ? There 's no way we can get a pass . If one is missing , they 'll change the whole lot . We have to copy it without them knowing ? - Right . - Houdini couldn 't do it . - Maybe I can . - How ? My mother . - Anybody ready for another ? - No , thanks . I think we 've all had enough . Think for yourself . - Okay ? - So far , so good . Dan , we need the best or we 're dead . No one told Picasso how to paint . Lay off . - Tell Mr. Dupres we 're starting dinner . - Yes , ma 'am . Come on . Okay , go . Mr. Dupres seemed to be somewhat indisposed . - Please excuse me for a moment . - Of course . Dinner is served . Your company has spoiled my appetite . Then go to bed . I won 't have you lying about like a derelict . Very well , madam . - ls everything okay , Eleanor ? - Just fine , thank you . Not so fast . You 're making my head swim . Tell him I 'll be right down . - Where is he ? - Inside . I 'll go get him . - No , you can 't . - Why ? We can 't risk everything for one person . No matter who it is . We 've gotta go . Let 's go ! Stop right there ! Hello , Mother . This is a nice photograph for our family album . What are you doing sneaking around here ? I 'm warning you ! I won 't shoot it out with you . That 's what I 'm doing here . Look at us . This is crazy . Why have you done this to me ? You said it 'd never happen here . Then we woke up to fascism . Those who respect the law are free . Criminals like you cry " fascist . " You 're as free as your leash . Tug too hard , you 'll hang by it . - Good night , Mother . - Don 't test me ! - I 'm warning you . - You 'd shoot your own son ? It was my son . How could he ? How could he ? Downstairs ! Search the grounds ! Get him . - Not back ? - No , not yet . You did the right thing . You couldn 't risk the mission . I don 't know how many more decisions I can handle . - Becomes easier . - I doubt that . When I was in Africa , I was armed . A soldier came into my church . There was a family hiding there . Suspected guerrillas , that 's what he said . Guerrillas . A 10-year-old boy , a 12-year-old girl and their mother . He was gonna shoot them . I had to decide whether I was gonna let him do that . You killed him ? God forgive me . Right in my own church . Hey , leave a couple ribs intact . I was so worried about you . You were ? How worried ? I was just as worried as I would be if anybody ... You were a bit more concerned about me . You 've got a high opinion of yourself . I 'm beginning to get a high opinion of you . - Congratulations on getting back . - Thanks . - Your mom invited you to dinner ? - She insisted . Is this how your earth girl makes love ? She was young . I was her first . I think she loves you . Look . The way she looks at you . She believes everything you 're whispering to her . I 'd rather not think about the experience . Why don 't you show me ? Are you serious ? Miss Walsh ? Here 's a message for you . You . You used to call me Mike . I wondered why your stepfather wanted to see me . That was a dirty trick . - You wouldn 't come if I 'd asked . - I sure wouldn 't have . They want you dead . They 'll kill you . You worried for me or for yourself ? - What do you want , Mike ? - They took my son . I want him back . - Sean ? - They took him and the whole town . - Are they dead ? - Not quite . - They 're packed aboard your ship . - What do you mean ? People , packed in cocoons for shipping . In a state near death , like suspended animation . - What for ? - Food . No . It 's true . That 's why they increased our rations . They 're fattening us up . I want you to take this and find Sean . He 's in something called Section 34 . Please . I 'll do what I can . You stay out of sight , I 'm not kidding . They 'll do anything to get you . - I 'll try and get word to you . - Kristine ? This is for you , Mike . Don 't go looking for an ally . - What are you doing off the trail ? - lt 's Donovan ! Laser blast below . Two mounted guards in pursuit . Now heading for intercept . Damn . You jeopardized everything by acting alone . You trusted a traitor . What do you expect ? They have my boy . I expect you to think of us before yourself ! You risked all of us . You don 't care . That 's not true . You don 't understand . It has nothing to do with you . Mike , we need you . I need you . But unless you give us your best , you should go before you hurt us . Flight crews , prepare for incoming cargo ships . Downloading in Bay 7 . Tanker approaching departure area . Sean . Just a minute . What are you doing here ? I 'm lost . All right . Let 's try it one more time . - Why were you in a restricted area ? - I told you , I was lost . - What 's going on ? - She was outside the special section . - There must be an explanation . - She has yet to give a satisfactory one . Take her into my lab . - I don 't know what you 're plotting ... - Don 't speak to me like that . - I am chief of security . - You 're trying to discredit me . She 's your recruit , your associate , your friend . I have no friends among humans . If she betrays us , your judgment must be questioned . - I 'll speak to her myself . - Why not leave it to me ? - My men are expert interrogators . - I said I 'll handle it . Very well . But from now on I 'll be keeping an eye on her . Leave us . You 've placed me in an awkward position . I 'd never do anything to put you in a bad light . I just made a wrong turn . Of course you did . But you must be very careful . I am a woman of some authority , and therefore I have enemies . Enemies who would use anyone or anything to hurt me . - We must not give them any opportunity . - No , of course not . The consequences could be most unfortunate . - Willie . - Harmony ! I 'm glad to be looking at you . Yes . I 'm happy to see you too . See , yes . To see you . I waited at our spot , but you never came . They move me . Change hours . I must work . Everything . - They move many of us here . - Why so many ? I 'm just a worker . They tell me small . Small ? Little . They tell you little . Same thing on this planet . The low man 's always the last to know . I want to touch you , but ... I know . I want to be with you , Willie . Let 's review it again . We 'll have three rings of security at the event . Outside , we 'll be protected by the passes . Inside our troops will command the lobby and corridors . Finally , the new security doors make the lobby impenetrable . Lovely plan , even if it is my own . I don 't want you dealing drugs . It 's a dirty war . Dealing opens doors . - I 've heard the excuses before . - lt 's not an excuse . Anything we do to put lizards and their bootlickers on ice helps . Let 's get on with it . Hello , Mike . I envy you , the riches of your planet . Martin , we 're gonna need your help at the hospital . That plan 's as nuts as sending Kristine to Section 34 . What 's it to you ? Our network is based on the mother ship . Security is too tight now . We 'll expose John on national TV . You have to keep the broadcast up . You 'll never do it . Steven will stop you at the door . - We 've counterfeited the passes . - All right . Say you do get inside , you have no chance against his troops . We 'll handle them . This scheme is so reckless . It 's ill-conceived . It may be , but it 's our only chance . Maybe we can wake people up to what 's going on . We don 't have a prayer without your help . Please . All right . Somehow that picture will stay on the air . - There 's just one more thing . - With you there always is . We 're gonna need some help getting out of there . - I suppose you have a plan for that ? - You bet I have . Don 't be so negative , Martin . You 'll give yourself an ulcer . - Sorry . - So am I. - We won 't say of this . - You bet you won 't . - You 're acting like them . - They killed my wife . - And my partner . - He didn 't . He 's not a fighter ! - What is this ? - He didn 't do anything . - He 's one of them . - He may be , but he saved my life . We need information . I 'm gonna get it . Like back at the force ? Ask him questions with your nightstick ? You want him . You have to come through me . We 're not fighting each other . She 's right . We 're the Resistance , not a lynch mob . You 're a biologist , Robert . You 're dedicated to preserving life . - All life but this kind . - You wanted a specimen , you got it . Good . Then let 's use him . Mark , bring him in the lab . - Fascinating . - A totally different hemoglobin . - How about platelets ? - I don 't see any . Awful lot of plasma in there . Take a look . Yeah , I see . Hi . Hello . I was just wondering do you know a Visitor youth leader named Brian ? No . I am sorry , I do not . - Are you sure ? - I am sure . When is your baby coming ? I couldn 't help noticing the patch around your neck . It is nearly all the way around . Now keep your mind on your work , okay ? - Yeah ? - Have they done anything to Willie ? Just some humane blood tests , that 's all . You 're wrong about him . He could never hurt anybody . He 's nice . You must like reptiles . That 's not true . I don 't think they 're lizards . - Didn 't you see Donovan 's tape ? - I saw Kristine Walsh 's report . It 's makeup that the terrorists do , like in a movie . - You really believe that ? - Yeah . Come here . I hope you have a strong stomach . What are you doing ? Now ask him about the other lies . Ask him why they 're here . Is it true ? Come on . Tell her . It is true . There . Martin said they were immunized against all diseases . He doesn 't exhibit allergic reactions . - Here , Dad . - Thank you . Julie . You have to get rid of it . What do you mean ? - I want an abortion right now ! - We talked about that ... I don 't care ! You have to get rid of it ! You don 't understand ! It 's one of them ! - Robin ! - Watch him ! That doesn 't matter ! I resent your presence . It 's a family decision . Stay out ! This is the first mating between our race and an alien species . It 's too important a decision for a 17-year-old and her father . - No one 's gonna experiment on her ! - Take it easy , Robert . There are crucial moral principles at stake ... I don 't want it ! It 's not gonna be a baby , it 's gonna be some horrible thing . Are you absolutely sure about that ? Brian 's the only one I ever slept with . You can 't make her go through this for some ideal . - Abortion is murder . - This is different . - The principle 's the same . - We 've heard this before . Those are old arguments for an old issue . This is entirely new . He 's right . We know so little . There 's never been a conception like this . An abortion could be dangerous . I don 't care . I 'd rather die than have this thing . This baby could be a ray of hope a sign of peace between us . The potential is just too great to be ignored . So are the dangers . We can 't take responsibility for her , it 's her body . It 's her decision . I want it gone . Sweetheart , this is as uncomfortable as it 's gonna get . I don 't care how much it hurts . Just get rid of it . Where 's Fred ? I don 't know . We have to start without him . I 'm gonna make an incision in your abdomen and send a camera down so I can see what I 'm doing . Why not do a regular abortion ? It 's a laparoscopy . It 's a new technique and it 's real safe . It won 't take long . Besides , you get to see yourself on TV . Okay , doctor , the patient and I are ready whenever you are . Go ahead . Take a look at that . - We 'll have to put you out , okay ? - Why , what 's the matter ? - Nothing . - Tell me what 's wrong . We 're just gonna sedate you for a little bit , it 's okay . - That 's right . - lt 's okay . Okay . Breathe deeply , Robin . That 's it . I 'm seeing lots of strands of wispy fibers . They 're threaded throughout the abdominal cavity . My God , it 's growing through the uterine wall . It 's tapped directly into the bladder and liver . - Where were you ? - They 're double checking ID 's . How 's the fetus ? See any features ? I 've never seen anything like it . The sac is opaque , gelatinous . Those fibers look like umbilical cords . Hand me the scissors . I 'm gonna cut one . Temp 's down four degrees , heart rate up 130 . That 's better already . Okay . We 're gonna try again . She 's slipping again . Body temp down four degrees . Normal again . - lt 'll kill her before we take it out . - Stop it , we 're not doing it . She 'll have to carry this baby , and we 'll have to deliver it . I 'm afraid I 'm not real good company right now . That bad , huh ? I 'm just ... I 'm just sick and tired of it . I 'm tired of trying to be some kind of guerrilla leader . Guerrilla . What is that ? Trying to pull everybody together . Trying to pass as a doctor , as if I know what I 'm doing . I can 't handle it . Let someone else do it . You 're the whole show . There is no one else . She could 've died , because I don 't know ... Everything ? Yes . No one expects you to know everything except you . Guess that 's pretty arrogant , huh ? I wouldn 't know . I 'm too self-centered to notice . This is Kristine Walsh at the L.A. Medical Center . You 're looking at the hottest ticket in America . Invitation only . Never have I seen so many celebrities in one place . Everybody who is remotely anybody is here tonight . We 've spotted luminaries from every field . World-renowned doctors , politicians , actors , athletes , even royalty . All have come to L.A. to be present for John 's historic announcement . There isn 't a single limo available in town tonight . And all police are on duty . Security is very tight here at the Medical Center . Good evening . - That isn 't necessary . - I insist . - I know it 'll be wonderful . - lf it is , it 's due largely to you . Could we go in , please ? Just a minute . Let me see that . - Go right in . - Thank you . The passes are okay . Everyone knows what to do . Let 's go . The party 's on . - I 'll go upstairs for refreshments . - Good idea . - How 's the shrimp ? - Looks fine to me . - Will you be all right here ? - Fine . The cake looks good . I think I 'll try some . All cameras are transmitting . We have complete coverage of the event on video and audio . Transmit to all ships . Repeat . Transmit to all ships . Okay , Tom , on three . Three , two ... This is for America and the world . I 've just been given permission by Diana , a trusted aid of John 's to make an exclusive announcement to all not fortunate enough to be here in person . Tonight John will give this planet an infallible vaccine which resists all forms of cancer . I repeat , a vaccine which prevents all forms of cancer . This truly is a historical night . When Father Andrews acts , I 'll signal . And I 'll shut the lobby front , back and sides . - Would you mind not doing that ? - What ? Thank you . Ladies and gentlemen I give you the Supreme Commander . Thank you . Thank you . Good evening to all of you . It gives us Visitors great pleasure to be here tonight . Because it gives us a chance to repay the hospitality the people of Earth have shown us . You 've all tried to help us collect the resources we need to save the people of our planet . It seems only fair that we reciprocate . We 've got a fire in Bay 6 . Get an extinguisher over here . That 's it . Right here . Thank you . I am honored to announce that beginning tomorrow doors will be open at this hospital and within weeks , around the world ... Now ! Now ! Get the torch . And more troops ! Keep taping this . Grab some air , pretty face . Everybody freeze ! They are not our friends . They 've come to rape Earth and kill us . They are not who they appear to be . This is not science fiction . This is what they are . It 's a trick . Stop that transmission ! - Stop the transmission ! - Something 's wrong . All right . Okay , let 's go . Go . Go . Secure this room , nobody in or out . You , control this crowd . Let 's go ! Go to the squad ship , you 'll be safer there . What 's going on ? Get on the air and tell the viewers that this is a terrorist hoax . Now . Go . You have just seen a terrorist attack on the hospital . It wasn 't terrorism , but resistance . Resistance to the monsters taking over our planet . You see them as they are . Reptiles . They must be fought . They must be defeated . Blow it . Come on , let 's go ! Hurry up , will you ? Let 's go ! Shut it ! - Come on ! - Shut it ! - What are you doing ? - Going back . It 's too late . - I 'm not leaving her . - You got to . There 's no way to get her back . Get away . There 's more than one life at stake here . - I don 't care . - Yes , you do . Donovan , come on . Now ! - Where are they ? - We lost them . Idiot ! Reinforce all positions . They must not escape . Yes , sir . Be careful , be careful . Freeze ! You 're all surrounded . Get inside the squad ship . Move ! One false move and you 're all dead . Hurry ! Hurry ! Come on you , move ! Tell Steven we 're taking the rebels to the mother ship . - Rebels captured , taken to mother ship . - Report when they arrive . The rebels are being transported to the mother ship . Where 's John ? Where no one can see him . Your security was nonexistent . You 've been criminally negligent and will be held accountable . Anyone need a ride home ? - Robin . - Where 's Julie ? - We don 't know . - You don 't know ? - She 's the only doctor we 've got . - We 'll get her back . What do we do now ? We 've got no choice . Let 's go for it . Stop ! Halt ! Stop that van . Wait a minute , stop . Halt ! - Oh , my God . - Come along . - Hurry ! - Get out ! This is a prize . Almost worth what we paid tonight . Good work , Daniel . Congratulations . I wish we had more like you . Yes . Congratulations on selling out to a bunch of nightcrawlers . You need an attitude adjustment , my dear . And it will be my pleasure to give it to you . Put her aboard my ship , if you can manage that . We Visitors are proud of this ceremony since it gives us the chance to repay the hospitality the people of Earth have shown us . You 've all tried to help us ... Can you believe they 're trying this ? - America will buy it too . - Sure will . Who would believe lizards would cure cancer ? - Moving 's a waste , Julie won 't talk . - They can extract information . ... and painless vaccine for a disease which afflicts millions of people : Cancer . You 've just seen the real broadcast , given by John the Visitors ' Supreme Commander . I know I speak for peace-loving people with whom I 'm grateful that the Visitors have given to us far more than they 've asked from us . I 'm Eleanor Dupres , from the Los Angeles Medical Center . - How was that ? - Perfect . - As long as you 're pleased . - We are . - I 'll see you later ? - You sure will . - Bye . - Thank you . - You 're very accessible . - When it 's useful . You made us accessible last night . If Diana hadn 't covered you with this moviemaking our credibility would be gone . We 'll kill the rebels tonight . We 've gotten information we needed . We 'll attack their headquarters . They 'll be a memory within hours . Her history suggests she 'll be difficult . I 'll break her . She 's going to be my masterpiece .

 This is a story about Walter Nebicheru ... he 's doing what he loves most , fights crime on the streets . See Walter was a cop . accident , his boss does not want on the street . Captain ! - Come back to the board with the cases ! Now ! So Walter has to fight crime on your way in the computer room , there is a expert . = = Fortunately for me , Walter advanced knowledge of electronics led him to experiment with neèim called a hologram . It 's a fancy name for a 3D image , which is perfect when can look really That sounds really , with enough energy and that I feel really . and so I came . My name is . .. AUTOMAN . You must be Walter Nebicher . How do you know that ? It is in my line of the program . I have to say you 're good . In fact odlièan . Look great . If you say so . - Well programmed me to be honest . Tell me ... Why did you give me the name Automan ? This means that you first fully automatic man in the world . You can do anything , because ... not real . But I did , I 'm real as you are . I 'm just different , and thanks to you ... I am perfect . No one is perfect , Automan . - That 's not true , Walter . Programmed me to watch the second and to do everything , and they are equally good . Jimmy Connors play tennis , John Travolta dancing . On a scale of 1 to 10 , I consider that ... 11th I created a monster . . What was actually created by Walter is the perfect force for good . It 's me . Greatest game in town All we needed it . Another bomber who terrifies the town . Bar this is the only place that has so far attacked . This is the only one for which we have tip . Hey , how 's it going ? - We found the Lieutenant .

I hope this means you 've dismantled the ? Yes , the customary thing : detonator , clock mechanism , a plastic explosive . However , the review when return to headquarters . Perhaps out who made it . Good . - Is there a club owner ? I am the owner of the club . I Maroni . Samantha . - I 'm Lieutenant Curtis , and this is a cop Caldwell . Do you have any idea who might ask you bomb ? I am always fair to everyone . Now it 's gone ! Lieutenant , the light disappears in the entire city ! Electricity went out . I do not know what 's going on , but once we 're lucky . How so ? - Electricity is not missing while èaèkali by the bombs . Speak police . Raziðite immediately . Tells police . Raziðite immediately . Leave This area immediately . Immediately leave this field . Demonstration newest and most advanced video game market , begins immediately in Sector 12 Great blackout zamraèio the whole western part of Los Angeles homes , hospitals and offices remained in total darkness . So far , plants could not explain to us the mysterious interruption , which has already caused numerous accidents saobraæajne . And we have just received a report from the Los Angeles Police on a number of robberies and vandalism in the whole area of ​ ​ . It began . Exactly at 19 : 57 the computer company is electrical power to exclude the LA half . A for 36 minutes will make our Next command . 'm Gonna go crazy ! This is a mild word for what will that befalls them . And this is just the beginning 's largest computer games ever played . Attention all visitors . What kind of games do you like to pretend ? I 've been doing games for computer rooms Pets , more but I do not . Now you 've really gone ! Man , how I crashed ! This is the best part of the game . How 's the game , runs are getting harder and harder . These are the true paths to exist somewhere in the world . Cursor ! What are you doing here ? What is this ? - Hologram . Only I have an idea for my new game . Do not dare to show up in the public . Sorry Walter , but we had to contact you , and this seemed like the best way . - Auto ! Is that you ? Where are you ? - I 'm here . What are you doing there ? This is not just an opportunity to see old friends . It is important to Walter . - What is it ? Zamraèenje . - Zamraèenje ? What zamraèenje ? The entire western part of the LA was without power for 30 minutes . 30 minutes ! But how ? - I do not know . Better get back to the headquarters . Invited all the free people . You need them the most . Why ? - Well , let 's say that it has to do with ... computers . Wally , it was already time to show up . It was not easy , Roxanne . Accidents were on the whole west side . Do not worry zamraèenja Captain Boyd , longer . And then what ? Come with me . Yes , sir gradonaèelnièe ? I look at the computer right now . No , sir gradonaèelnièe , I have no idea where it came from that information . No , gradonaèelnièe Brandon . Yes , sir , computer expert has just arrived . Well , Nebish , time to poène  earning their bread . Jack , sorry . No pametovanja , just tell us what 's going on . It would help me to send some thing . This has begun to appear . The entire Los Angeles . Veèera  nje zamraèenje is just an example of what we do . Get ready to pay $ 10 million , or consequences . Whoever they are , they want an answer by veèera  njih news . 's Locked ! Disable all of the new programs . All computers in the urban system behave in the same way . Including the one in power . Preoptereæenje not caused zamraèenje . They did . - They know their job . Maybe we will take days to bypass this program . Wally , do not have the days available . Do you know how much the city system depends on the computer ? For all vital functions . I 'm afraid to know . Hospital only could we Bay into a major problem . Us ? Not us , Nebish , you ! You 're first on the list . This is new to me . Extortion through high technology . Do you have any idea ? - First you need to check all computer experts in the city and find out who enough city system knows that the way to break it . Roxanne , check out what else controls the city system , to know what else can we expect to . That 's right , boy . And I 'm going to see what happens on the street . Let Automan ! This is an emergency case ! You do not have to raise a voice of Walter . I can anticipate your needs . And why ... - Did it ever occur to you that I have needs ? What ? - Think I have no feelings ? Auto , you 're a hologram . With electronic observation and pronicljivo  æu . Even me that I can do something that I like , and some do not . Sure , I 've made so love everything I do . It was careless of you , is not it ? Maybe there are good things about your missing moral restrictions . Auto , I 'm not a bigot . And why I love it just blondes ? - Auto ... There are very nice and caring . - Auto ! I do not work just because I ... - Auto ! We have work to do . Good . BEFORE straight to the point . I touched it with different computers that are downloaded , lame and are in terrible trouble . Not the only ones . What is the solution ? You do not have computers or more their pamæenje . I can only say that we have to do do what they do , but I can not remember why . Are you saying that the programmed not to reveal who they were programmed ? Right . - Excellent . Auto , I hate to have to say this , but maybe our opponents know more about computers than I do . But certainly no more than I do . All my cousins ​ ​ are computers . Not required , Walter . This is for me . For you ? - I told my friends if you receive another uncommon new program to notify me immediately . This is a call out of the flood control in LA . Ostaæemo in touch . Flood Control ? O God ! I have to tell the captain ! I can not evacuate the whole The area just because you say it . Just imagine that it would cause panic . And what if I 'm right ? I do not know what 's going to happen , but definitely will not be good . If you already have a tip , how come you do not have the details ? There 's something about What are my source could not speak . Or is programmed to speak . It ? I thought you had a real " fair " snitch . Do not be yet another your computer ? Slowly Captain Wally us more never once failed . Everything else works perfectly , Captain . Good . Well , Nebisheru , now what ? I 'm sorry , sir , but this is a far . The main gate to control flood opens . You have to close it . The whole valley will be destroyed . The controls do not respond . - Fired somewhere you have control ? Yes , of course . - Where ? There , through the tunnel . But you can not own , let any adjustments to it . Hold me , Curtis ! It will not arrive in time . But I know someone who can . It was not possible spreèiti , cursor . When programming , computer must do what he has commanded . But I can not stop , at least I can try to . Here is what we seek . Closed ! Time ... would be perfect throughout the country all weekend Channel 6 staff wish you a good night And enjoyable evening . Pleasant evening ! What is with these people ? Do not know the danger ? If you know , do not talk about it . Neither the word defend , and no explanation for zamraèenje . The problem with the generator , right ! City of covering up the situation , Ron . I 'll have to step up attacks . - Ron Wait , how far do we go ? Knew the possible consequences , as we are aware . This is more than a game , it 's revenge . I think it 's necessary little confusion . I need your help , Ellie . Bart. I 'll give them a false suspect . - Why ? Because I understand how things develop . Trebaæe time lure them into our trap . The only thing I do not understand how a hand-held control herself turned . Yes , even the people who work there , is not clear . Yes , the computer must be wrong . What else could it be , Lieutenant ? What to do ? - Ready for the new program . " Liberated " it was , in some way . Maybe other city computers " acquitted " . Then returns to work . I wonder why they gave us access . Keep looking who is behind it all . I want , but be prepared for the wait . It might take a while . Did you get lucky ? - No , no . As we are all made up . Everything in the city is back to normal . But someone vowed to kill many people , if he fails to pay the city $ 10 million . Boyd . Right there . Nebish is a discovery . Here it .

Good . Wally , I need a list of places where out , his habits , everything . Print is there . - Excellent . Seems to finally move forward . Perfect suspect to drop us right into his lap . Yeah , right in my lap . I like to work as an undercover agent . But do not you think you should have more style ? Let 's go to a convention computer experts , Auto . not a rock star . And you really think that one of them was involved in the what happened to poor urban computers ? I think it 's too big a coincidence that is ignored . Yes , Macropoulos the perfect suspect . Maybe too perfect . I know what you mean . Now that the police attacked computer , not even I no longer believe that . At least until you no good to check . All visitors attention ! World renowned graphic designer Kevin Cleary will display the video show on the big screen . Remember , be cool . Then I better improve my mask . Cursors ! - I do not ! Good evening , Automan . - Good evening . Look great , Auto . - Thanks , I 'm glad to see you again . Auto , stop it ! I guess I 'm not going to be rude . To ignore friends ? I want them to ignore you . Good , but we could promaæi important information . Okay , but why ? Do you want to know all about these computer experts here , is not it ? Who would know more about them than their creations ? Unfortunately , that makes sense . Can you at least try to be inconspicuous ? You will not even know I 'm here . Wally ! Glad to see you again . Who 's your friend ? - Only the fans of the game . Wally , meet Ron Tilson . Ron , this is Walter Nebicher . Wally is an old friend . Your name . I am aware of . Maybe you know of some of my game . No , I think it is something else . Walter ! ? Excuse me . 've Known him for something else . Ron , if you suspect ... Just calm Bart. My presence is necessary to win any game . I do not know if I want to win this game in . Thinking about its consequences . Bart does not cooperate with us , right ? Not . I 'm afraid so . Creator Areg game is also beyond doubt . He is a man , and porodièni all my free time implements the on the phone talking with your wife . This means that you shoot blindly ? - Walter , I do not shoot blindly . So you found anything yet ? How this sounds ? I Prièao with one of my best friends Zaxxon and he tells me that the woman that you call Ellie behaved strangely . How so ? - She was in close contact with the creator Cherry Bomb games and Ski Patrol . Johnson and Tilson . Damn ! I wish I could remember where I Tilson . Walter , it 's for you . Nebicher . - Wally , you 'd better come on right away . Computers are going crazy again . Press is required ? Threats , Wally . Ucenjivaèi say it will be hundreds of people crash in flames . Tell the captain that I was closer to home than Staff . I go there and I 'll try to decipher it . No time . Oh , my God ! What is it ? - That must be it . " Knock down in flames . " International Airport . Flight control computer . Walter , I guess it did not disturb ? Thousands of flights pass through the narrow corridors every day . Boss , I think I found it . International Airport . Flight Control Computer . Now we 're going to investigate . Thank boy . This is perhaps the most important you 've ever discovered . Meet me at the airport . No , we 're not . Stay end of your machine . Their closure is my job a discovery that that madman or group behind it is your job . Yes , sir , nastaviæu looking . Everything is ready to go , Walter . I thought " put on a " pilot 's uniform order to fit into the crowd at the airport . Izgledaæu fantasièno . As John Wayne in between heaven and earth . 'll Just spend a lot of energy to anything . 're Both grounded . least temporarily . View readings to see how far the fog . I 'd like to see a little bit of Los Angeles before they are ground . LA Tower , this 61st Trans Globalov Ago , 6 minutes have passed Palm Springs , ask about max. altitude . Max. altitude is 450 meters and approaching fast , but You will be able to sell . Above heaven and earth . Wonderful old movie , Walter . John Wayne saving all those people from certain death . Auto , that 's it ! Information about Johnson and Tilson . Ronald L.Tilson. He graduated from MIT in advanced computer technology and ... Oh , no ! - What is it ? Key Programmer consultant to the city Institute of Technology . Auto , where I heard his name . Radio 's program for four of the city . He was doing well until he took over the Los Angeles . Released is due to the high cost of overdrafts . Nothing criminal has not been proven . Looks like a good prime suspect . How do we find him ? So what are we to find the type who introduced them . Bart Johnson . He gave me a business card . Hello ! - Hello , Bart , Walter Nebicher here . Hi , Wally . Can we find somewhere today ? No , no . I 'll be busy today , Wally . Then to see the exhibition computer ? No , I will stay until then . ? What happened ? Something 's come up , I have to leave town , unexpected job . Wait a minute . It sounds weird to me . Maybe you 've touched a nerve . I think I have nothing to do with it . He says he 's leaving town . Something unpredictable . What are you doing ? - I 'll fix that . Bart , this is Special Agent Mann . Federal sector cyber crime . Federal ... ? - I would not leave the city I were you . At least until we are given the opportunity to talk with Ron Tilson . And if you know anything about interference in the operation of the flight control computers , this is your last chance to tell us . I do not know what you 're talking about it . Computers flight control ? I 'm glad so Bart. I would be sorry that you were involved in a mass murder . Look , I gotta go . I 'm late . I 'll leave you with a number that I can get the day and night . If you think of something we can help us . Well , wait a minute . OK , say . 555-2413 . OK . I do not know . We 're here all day and all is normal . All systems are operating normally , Captain . I can not say I 'm sorry for that . Let 's just hope that they will remain so . If Wally says that the flight control computers sabotaged then they are . Yes , but when and where will trouble to appear ? Everyone would be quieter , they are on the runway are still people that with small flags grounded planes . Time for pilots . Nice I 'll fit into airport crowds . Walter , do not I look beautiful in suit like the movie ? Yes , Auto , but we have a deal crosses the addition of . Hello ? Roxanne ? Roxanne , can not stop the alarm . I know I 'm right about the airport . Try odugovlaèi  more . We are coming . And I know who . Boyd gets ready to leave the airport . Everything was fine all day . Walter , he did not realize that I am never wrong ? The thing is that everything is fine , and we are told that they will not be . Better look . What are you doing ? I intercepted radar signals from for cheap access code . Is this legal ? - Radar signals such as TV and radio signals . They are in the air and everyone can see them . Seems to be fine . Everything looks and sounds perfectly normal . Fly well , 48th North American Do you have access to the runway 18th Understood . Here , North American 48 descend with the help of ILS 's . ( With the help of instruments ) We have 4 minutes to the contact with the ground . So thick that it could be cut with a knife . Do you have more than the minimum ? We 're close , but uspeæemo . Reduces us max. height of summer , but it would be that we can get down . Must be Roxanne . It can deliver a message to Captain . Hello , Wally ? - Yes , Bart ? This is Johnson ! Wally , as you said . Sru  iæe two passenger planes . How ? All we checked , the flight control computers work perfectly ? Not . No , it just looks that way . Programmed to display 6 miles between aircraft . I do not understand . - Radar shows aircraft that will as being 6 miles away , and they really fly at the same rate . What airlines Radar ? Trust me Wally . That man is a genius ! All signals in the area of ​ ​ the affected . Okay ? Everything will look normal , but planes at the same rate . Which planes ? - In 20 hours . Wally , everything happens in 20 hours . Bart , it 's only 4 minutes ! Look , I gotta go . Follow me . Ubiæe me . Who Bart ? Is it Tilson ? Save the people , Wally . It 's too late for me . 48th North American Two minutes before landing . What are we going to do , Auto ? We simply to subtract the 6 km and see what it looks like radar image . Oh , my God ! Is that what I think it is ? Yes , Walter . The two aircraft are flying the same path . Call Tower ! - Tower must " listen " radar . No , we have to go with one of the pilots and show him something which can not be ignored . Enough is enough ! Next we go on the flight home Waikiki . TA 61 free you airstrip 16th Here 48 North American descend in LA . All right on 48th Continue landing on runway 18th Understood . At 48 sleæe on runway 18th LA tower . Here Trans Global 61 are located at 450 meters . Sleæemo on runway 18th Hey , what 's that next to us on the radar ? Can not be anyone in the vicinity . Must be someone who is down on runway 17th Must try to land as many planes before the airport closed . I do not know , it 's awfully close . Trans Globalov called Tower 61 . Do you have someone above us ? No . The nearest aircraft is 3 miles ahead . Well , there 's something wrong . Wait a pilot to see what happens . There are far , and believe the tower . My God ! What is it ? Watch this ! They go right at each other . We need to get them to change course . Something is coming from the left . Forget left . Look ahead Captain ! Uzleæi ! I repeat , uzleæi ! Uzleæi ! - Uzleæi ! What was that shit ? Three aircraft in the same airspace . I do not know , but this last saved our lives . Actually , he saved 500 lives . Now it 's out of danger . But what was the other plane ? Whatever it was , the saved many lives . Better all close , computers is incorrect . If it was not this mysterious fighter , the other two planes would be crashed . Dod ... What ? Gas pedal is stuck ! Oh , my God ! What does this guy ? - I can control the car , Walter . Computer controls the main functions of the car . Lunatics ! Get out ! We need to get away driver ! Auto , this is Bart Johnson . What 's he doing here ? Do not know Walter , but someone wants him dead . Wally . Wally , are you okay ? I 'm good . We have a suspect . Somebody has restated automatic system in the car , in order to kill him . Someone who knows how to computer misuse . Policajèe Nebicher ? Doctor , I 'm a cop Nebicher . I brought the guy in the suit . Status g . Johnson is a serious , but stable . Has serious head injuries and chest . Is it conscious ? - Yet . I doubt that you will be able to talk to him next 48 hours . 48 hours ? Who knows what will happen by then ? I 'm sorry . Man , I better get some rest . The doctor was right , Wally . You have to get some sleep . Airport was unusable like this . Seriously considering to pay a ransom . But he can not do it . This will encourage others to do the same . He knows that . But just know that thanks èudu , so far no one was hurt . I wish I could and Auto something else to do . Who ? None ! I was just thinking about ... Nièemu . I want to go back to the hotel , where Convention held computer . Moraæe  But again that upristoji  . Computer says Johnson 923rd room Let 's look at the new game , where Johnson worked . Do not be sad about the fact that we care . Let 's look at this . I do not know , Walter . This new game looks like energy rays . This new technology could be harmful to my molecules . I am familiar with these telephone numbers . View phone numbers . Yes , they are known . Check them out . Flood of Los Angeles . Computer ready and waiting . Walter , as we suspected . These numbers are all over the city computer system . Johnson is one of the ucenjivaèa . But why was nearly killed ? Bart ! Bart ! Auto , what are we going to do ? The only thing we can do . Hide . Bart ! Bart ! Bart , are you there ? Bart , are you there ? I told you . Not here . I could have sworn I heard voices . It must have been someone 's TV . Unable to Johnson at the hotel . How can you be so sure ? Because players are good take appropriate steps , Ellie . That 's what I did . What steps ? I can only say , in order to win it is sometimes necessary to sacrifice a pawn . 're Crueler than I thought . I worked like a horse in this bloody town computer systems . Two years I 've prepared for control plant . So what do I get for that ? Failure ! Accusations of fraud ! I lost my job , family ... What is hell ? Watch Auto . We detected . It 's that Wallyjev friend ! A friend ? My ass ! Look at him ! I do not know how he did it . But it 's a hologram . Game . One of the advantages of my design is that whether or not I play can be a real friend ... Just touching of certain things . In other words : You 're under arrest ! And as you are concerned , young lady ... - I do not ! If you 're game , then this will have an effect on you . Auto , look at that ! How is desperate ! - Walter , I would not be laughing if I were you . Hey , I felt it ! Let 's get out of here . Auto . Car ! How is this possible ? The gun is in my world . Fires electron beam that disrupts my molecules . Auto Hold on . Must be something to do . I need to force the izleèi poremeæaj . More energy . Auto ! Thank you , Walter . Here we go . Now it will never arrive . Walter , you have an extraordinary faith in elevators , but forget that computers governing them , my friends . Lift No. 6 , Automan here . Understand . - Would you have done a favor ? Pleased . What is going on ? This is an express elevator . Maybe you pressed the wrong button ? Thanks , lift sixth Take us to the headquarters Auto . I 'll do the rest . Of course I 'll do that . But our Next move is already programmed . With or without us , stradaæe many people , nothing you can do to stop it . I have met all sorts of my career , but this type of is bezoseæajan . None has disclosed ? I would not say that . Offered us a deal , let him go , and he will revoke sledeæeg taxpayers . Maybe . Good deal . - A Ellie ? She should easily break . Ellie does not know anything . She told us that she was Tilson said that this will be a great a surprise for those who would hurt him . I do not understand why they were Tilson needed it and Johnson . After all , he has all the knowledge needed uo computer system . But not the whole . Only the part he asked . Well , Johnson and the girl did not on other systems ? They are professionals for computer games . Having such a mind respond to the challenges of this kind . When you put together the three of them , together they can come up with anything . If that bar could say and the three of us . Better tell us four others . - Lieutenant ! Curtis , where the hell have you been ? On a long , long search for Macropoulosom . But he does not exist . Tilson created by the computer . As the imaginary suspects . Created a false trail and tidy for monitoring . I 've been everywhere . I 'm done . In the men 's room in the eastern LA-ju , there Macropoulosovim graffiti with the name and phone number . Good , and whose number is it ? This one . Kidding ? Main Line police station . This one here . Just a little . Tilson has created a false trail here to bring Lieutenant Curtis . Why would you do that ? Unless and great surprise here . Wait a minute . Stop . Are you saying that we Tilson targets ? Yes , exactly that . Awful is that all makes sense . Captain ! - What is it ? - Are locked . What ? - The computer system is broken . Locks are jammed , the doors and windows . At all . I should have known . The whole system is on one computer . Why would we captured here ? Wally ... Wally , can you give us Tilson boot into the air with the help of a computer ? Only if a computer controlled bomb . Pirotehnièare I want you in my office , immediately . How much time do we have ? They gave us until 3 in the morning . There 's no way to search the entire building for 15 minutes . We need help . - All we have is this . Maybe not . Where you so long ! You have 15 minutes to find a bomb , big enough to bring down the building . Come on , Auto . I thought I 'll never call . We ... the problem . Bomb ... Walter , have you had luck ? No , sir . Good . We are less than 5 minutes . I suggest you go to the ground floor or basement . I 'll get the captain and Roxanne . Meet me there , OK ? 'll See it , Auto . I hope . It was nice knowing you . Wait a minute ! Do not you want to deaktivira  bomb ? How to deactivate , if not to find ? I know where it is . Let . Quickly ! Auto , the experts searched each Delic building . Even pirotehnièari are looking for . How would you know where it is , and you did not even ask ? I can feel it . Lift ! Good evening , Automan . I have less than 2 minutes to live . I know because I 've been programmed , and I know you do not have sensors for explosives . No , but I communicate with all computers in this building . Except one . More minutes countdown continues , Auto . Here we are . - But where ? This is pirotehnièara floor . Right . Do you remember bombs we 've been Lieutenant Curtis said that they found in a strip club the night before the first zamraèenja city ? Auto , the bombs that were already mute timing mechanism . Find a . I think we under-timer banal and Plastics explosive , tough to find microchips incredible that transmits vibrations . Yes , I can feel them . Walter 15 seconds . - Auto , for God 's sake ! - There it is ! You have 10 seconds Walter , Connect with me quickly . And let 's hope for the best . 9 , 8 , to see if we can to find the naughty little chip . Auto , there 's no time for speculation . There are only 5 seconds ! 4 , 3 , 2 .. You naughty boy ! Do you feel that Walter ? It seems that is not easy to be a hero if you programmed . It works now ! All systems are go . other computers ? Well , you should have been fine . Finally everything is back to normal . Not quite everything . I still have more questions than as Tilson had a target Nebisheru . And that 's a lot of questions . So if you need something to explain ... - Yes , it should . First of all , how did you know where the bomb was , and no one is not able to find ? Secondly , how did you know what the detonator hidden bombs in that , when the pirotehnièarima miss that ? I Thirdly , how could you do it dismantled without exploding and blow us all to paramparèad ? Poèetnièka luck ? Translated and synchronized : bojan969

LEON : But how come I 'd be there ? HOLDEN : Maybe you 're fed up , maybe you want to be by yourself . Who knows ? You look down and you see a tortoise . HOLDEN : It 's crawling towards you- - LEON : A tortoise ? What 's that ? HOLDEN : You know what a turtle is ? LEON : Of course . Same thing . LEON : I 've never seen a turtle . [ Distorted beeping ] But I understand what you mean . You reach down and you flip the tortoise over on its back , Leon . Do you make up these questions , Mr. Holden ? LEON : Or do they write them down for you ? The tortoise lays on its back , its belly baking in the sun beating its legs , trying to turn itself over , but it can 't . HOLDEN : [ Voice echoes ] Not without your help . But you 're not helping . What do you mean I 'm not helping ? HOLDEN : [ Voice echoes ] I mean , you 're not helping . Why is that , Leon ?

You wouldn 't have come if I just asked you to . Sit down , pal . BRYANT : Come on , don 't be an asshole , Deckard . I 've got four skin-jobs walking the streets . [ Distorted voices speak on CB radio , background ] They jumped the shuttle Off-world . Killed the crew and passengers . We found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks ago ... BRYANT : ... so we know they 're around . Embarrassing . BRYANT : No . Not embarrassing because no one will ever find out they 're here . You 're gonna spot them and you 're gonna air ' em out . I don 't work here anymore . DECKARD : Give it to Holden . He 's good . BRYANT : I did . He can breathe okay , as long as nobody unplugs him . He 's not good enough . Not as good as you . I need you , Deck . This is a bad one . The worst yet . I need the old Blade Runner . I need your magic . I was quit when I come in here , Bryant . I 'm twice as quit now .

LEON : That 's the hotel . HOLDEN : What ? LEON : Where I live . HOLDEN : Nice place ? LEON : Yeah , sure , I guess . There was an escape from the Off-world colonies two weeks ago . Six Replicants : three male , three female . They slaughtered 23 people and jumped a shuttle . An aerial patrol spotted the ship off the coast . No crew , no sight of them . Three nights ago they tried to break into the Tyrell Corporation . One got fried running through an electrical field . We lost the others . On the possibility they might try to infiltrate as employees I had Holden go over and run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers . Looks like he got himself one . HOLDEN : You look down and see a tortoise ; it 's crawling towards you . A tortoise ? What 's that ? HOLDEN : Know what a turtle is ? LEON : Of course . HOLDEN : Same thing . LEON : I 've never seen a turtle . I don 't get it . Why do they risk coming back to earth for ? What do they want out of the Tyrell Corporation ? BRYANT : You tell me , pal . That 's what you 're here for . DECKARD : What 's this ? BRYANT : Nexus 6 . Roy Batty . Incept date , 2016 . Combat model . Optimum self-sufficiency . Probably the leader . BRYANT : This is Zhora . She 's trained for an Off-world kick murder squad . Talk about Beauty and the Beast . She 's both . BRYANT : The fourth skin-job is Pris . A basic pleasure model . A standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies . They were designed to copy humans in every way , except their emotions . But the designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own emotional responses . Oh , hate , love , fear , anger , envy . So they built in a fail-safe device . Which is what ? Four-year life span . Now there 's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation . I want you to put the machine on it . And if the machine doesn 't work ? [ Shuttle roars ] [ Shuttle hums ] [ Ambient synthesizer music ] Do you like our owl ? It 's artificial ? Of course , it is . Must be expensive . Very . I 'm Rachael . Deckard . It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public . Replicants are like any other machine . They 're either a benefit or a hazard . If they 're a benefit , it 's not my problem . May I ask you a personal question ? Sure . Have you ever retired a human by mistake ? No . But in your position , that is a risk . TYRELL : Is this to be an empathy test ? Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response ? Fluctuation of the pupil . Involuntary dilation of the iris . We call it Voight-Kampff for short . Mr. Deckard , Dr. Eldon Tyrell . TYRELL : Demonstrate it . I want to see it work . DECKARD : Where 's the subject ? I want to see it work on a person . I want to see a negative , before I provide you with a positive . What 's that gonna prove ? Indulge me . On you ? TYRELL : Try her . It 's too bright in here . [ Mechanical buzz ] RACHAEL : Do you mind if I smoke ? It won 't affect the test . DECKARD : All right . I 'm gonna ask you a series of questions . Just relax and answer them as simply as you can . [ Electronic beeps ] It 's your birthday . Someone gives you a calfskin wallet . RACHAEL : I wouldn 't accept it . I 'd report the person who gave it to me to the police . You 've got a little boy . He shows you his butterfly collection plus the killing jar . I 'd take him to the doctor . DECKARD : You 're watching television . Suddenly you realize there 's a wasp crawling on your arm . I 'd kill it . [ Distorted hissing ] You 're reading a magazine . You see a full-page nude photo of a girl . Is this testing whether I 'm a Replicant or a lesbian , Mr. Deckard ? Just answer the questions , please . You show it to your husband . He likes it so much he hangs it in your bedroom . RACHAEL : I wouldn 't let him . [ Voices echo ] DECKARD : Why not ? RACHAEL : I should be enough for him . DECKARD : One more question . You 're watching a stage play , a banquet is in progress . The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters . The entree consists of boiled dog . [ White noise and crackling sounds ] Would you step out for a few moments , Rachael ? TYRELL : Thank you . DECKARD : She 's a Replicant , isn 't she ? I 'm impressed . How many questions does it usually take to spot one ? DECKARD : I don 't get it , Tyrell . How many questions ? DECKARD : Twenty , thirty , cross-referenced . It took more than a hundred for Rachael , didn 't it ? She doesn 't know ? TYRELL : She 's beginning to suspect , I think . Suspect ! How can it not know what it is ? Commerce is our goal here at Tyrell . " More human than human " is our motto . Rachael is an experiment . Nothing more . We began to recognize in them a strange obsession . They 're emotionally inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the experiences which you and I take for granted . If we gift them with a past , we create a cushion or a pillow for their emotions and consequently we can control them better . Memories . You 're talking about memories ! HOLDEN : Reaction time is a factor . Please , pay attention . HOLDEN : Answer as quickly as you can . LEON : Sure . HOLDEN : 1187 Hunterwasser . LEON : That 's the hotel . HOLDEN : What ? LEON : Where I live . HOLDEN : Nice place ? LEON : Yeah , I guess . Is that part of the test ? HOLDEN : No .

RACHAEL : Look . It 's me with my mother . DECKARD : Yeah ? Remember when you were six ? You and your brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window . You were gonna play doctor ? He showed you his , and when it got to be your turn , you chickened and ran . Remember that ? Did you ever tell anybody that ? Your mother ? Tyrell ? Anybody ? You remember the spider that lived in the bush outside your window ? DECKARD : Orange body , green legs ? Watched her build a web all summer ? Then one day , there 's a big egg in it . The egg hatched ... . RACHAEL : The egg hatched ... DECKARD : And ? ... and a hundred baby spiders came out . And they ate her . Implants . Those aren 't your memories ! DECKARD : They 're somebody else 's . They 're Tyrell 's niece 's . Okay . Bad joke . DECKARD : I made a bad joke . You 're not a Replicant . Go home . Okay ? No , really . I 'm sorry .

ROY : Can the maker repair what he makes ? TYRELL : Would you like to be modified ? ROY : Stay here . I had in mind something more radical . What ... . What seems to be the problem ? Death . TYRELL : Death ? Well , I 'm afraid that 's a little out of my jurisdiction . You- - I want more life Fucker ! The facts of life ... . To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system is fatal . TYRELL : A coding sequence cannot be revised once it 's been established . Why not ? Because , by the second day of incubation , any cells that have undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies , like rats leaving a ship . Then , the ship sinks . ROY : What about E.M.S. recombination ? We 've already tried it . Ethyl Methane Sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen . It created a virus , so lethal the subject was dead before he left the table . Then a repressor protein , that blocks the operating cells . It wouldn 't obstruct replication , but it does give rise to an error in replication . So that newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you 've got a virus again . TYRELL : But , this , all of this is academic . TYRELL : You were made as well as we could make you . But not to last . The light that burns twice as bright , burns half as long . And you have burned so very brightly , Roy . TYRELL : Look at you . You 're the prodigal son . You 're quite a prize . I 've done questionable things . Also , extraordinary things .

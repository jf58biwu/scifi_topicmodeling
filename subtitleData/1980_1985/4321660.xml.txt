 Our primary objective is Mr. Locke and his helicopter . You promised you wouldn 't hurt him . I 've had to take some special precautions . Arrest these three . Kate ! Jason , are you all right ? This is the Leader , the hope for the salvation of the world . I won 't give you Airwolf ! You have much to learn , Mr. Locke . We 're in position over the target ship now . The Nova Seven is tracking you now . Are you guys ready ? Armed and set . MIKE : I 'm getting the signal . SAINT JOHN : The Nova Seven has taken over targeting . No hands . I 'll fire a copperhead at wide range and see if it can keep it on course . That 's one way to get rid of navy surplus . Looks like you guys have been replaced . Not yet , I 'm having trouble disengaging the targeting link . Plus , we 've still got at least two hours of data to collate . I hate the late shift . You guys can work it out . Fill me in on Monday . I 'm out of here . You and Kate off for another romantic weekend ? What makes you think that ? Oh , I don 't know . The smile . The glint in your eye . The road map in your pocket . There 's this place up the coast that she 's dying to see . I can 't say no to her . Ah . Sounds like you two are getting pretty serious . Sounds like you 're trying to play matchmaker . Who , me ? Yeah , you . See you Monday . Have a good time . See you . So much for a fun weekend in the great outdoors . I like the rain . You had the same smile on your face the first time I saw you , when you brought that memo from Newman . I have a confession to make . Already ? I bribed his secretary to let me take it up to you . ( CHUCKLING ) You what ? I wanted to meet you . I can 't believe it . What did it cost you ? A cheese Danish . A cheese Danish . That 's how much I was worth to you ? If I 'd known we 'd work out , I would have given her the jelly doughnut . Thanks a lot . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) You nut . We 'd better be going . How about Dr. Robertson ? I promised we 'd stop in . We 'll see her next time . I haven 't seen her in years . Kate ... Please ? There isn 't much time . ( SOFTLY ) Please , Jason . Kate , you 're not going to convince me . Come on , Jason , please ? Okay . Turn it off . Okay . You convinced me . I was lucky to get the lease on this place . It 's perfect for my work . Are you still researching alpha-waves , Doctor ? You know of my work ? I 'm flattered , Mr. Locke . It 's hard to keep a lid on that kind of thing . Artificial intelligence , actuated brain scan monitoring . That 's pretty impressive stuff . As I recall , the Company wasn 't too pleased when you resigned . The important thing is that I 've found a way to use it to serve humanity . There 's something I want to show you . You said you wouldn 't hurt him ! He 's only sleeping , dear . You should be sleeping , too . Prepare him for implant surgery . Nobody eats fruit on pizza . Hey , you asked for the luau special . I asked for triple anchovy , and I get papaya . You 're always afraid to try something different , aren 't you ? I 'm only afraid to try things that make me sick . Guys , can we quit the floor show ? I 'm starving . You 're such a stick in the mud , Saint John . I 'm going to call Jason , update him on the communications glitch in the satellite com-link . He 's not home . He and Kate went away for the weekend . ( BOTH ) Again ? What are they ? Married ? Well , not yet , but who knows ? He didn 't say anything to us . Sometimes it takes a woman to understand these things . LEADER : Are you ready to implant the Selective Behavior Module , Dr. Robertson ? I 'm about to proceed , yes . LEADER : And the programming ? We 'll begin in the morning . KATE : They 're coming for us , Jason ! You gotta do something ! You 've to get it away from them ! ( GUN FIRING ) ( KATE SCREAMING ) They have me ! Jason ! Kate ! You 've got to do something ! You 've to get it away from them ! ( MAN LAUGHING EVILLY ) ( KATE SCREAMING ) KATE : They 're going to kill me ! They 're going to hurt Kate , Jason . You 're the only one who can stop them ! Stop them , Jason ! KATE : Jason , help ! They 're going to kill me ! ( SCREAMING ) Jason , help me ! KATE : Jason , they 're going to kill me ! LOCKE : Kate ! You have to get Airwolf away from them . It 's the only way ! Jason ! Help me ! ( MOUTHING ) Kate ! No ! God , I hate Mondays . If I had my way , I 'd have a five-day weekend , a two-day work week , and lots of holidays . If you campaigned on that platform you could get elected president . Speaking of long weekends , anyone heard from Jason ? Not yet . I think work is probably the last thing on his mind . Kate is numero uno . Numero uno . He 's really hot on her , isn 't he ? I think it 's great . Deep down Jason 's an incurable romantic . Well , love sick or not , we still have to solve the problem with the Nova Seven 's tracing program . Okay , I vote that we start on it without waiting for Jason . I second the motion . Anyone who can hook up to that satellite can find Airwolf . Hi , Jason . I just called to thank you . I had a great time this weekend . Me , too . I wonder where the time went . It just flew by . Jason ... Do you remember the paperwork you were going to do for me ? Paperwork ? Remember the paperwork , Jason . Take care of the paperwork . I remember . Good . I can 't wait to see you again . I 'll call soon . Bye , Jason . Goodbye , Kate . Very good . You promised you wouldn 't hurt him . He has the same implant as you do . If you both cooperate , I see no need to detonate the device . You 'll see him soon enough , and you two can spend as much time together as you like . LEADER : Proceed with the next step , Doctor . I 'm well aware of procedure , thank you . You tend to forget who initiated this plan . Our primary objective is Mr. Locke and his helicopter . I 'm proceeding with the first program recall . ( GRUNTING ) ( PHONE RINGING ) Well , we can 't lose the com link to the satellite without entirely reprogramming the memory bank . Yeah , it looks that way . We have to get approval from Washington . That could take another week . So , we 're vulnerable for at least a week . ( SIGHS ) All right , Jason . We 're on our way . That was Jason . Says it 's an emergency . Let 's go . I want you to call Jason again , Katherine . This time make him come to you . Do you need prompting ? No . Please . I 'll make the call . ( PHONE RINGING ) Jason ? Help me ! Help me ! Kate ! What 's wrong ? Kate ! Where are you ? Answer me ! Please ! I don 't want to do this ! Don 't make me do this to Jason ! Calm down , Katherine ! Your subject seems to have escaped your control . Don 't touch her . Physical force is completely unnecessary . Kate ! Kate ! Take her to her room . What 's going on , Jason ? I 've had to take some special precautions . Arrest these three . Hey , Jason , what the hell are you doing ? Hey , that won 't be necessary . Place them in detention until further instructions . Jason , are you all right ? I want to speak to Newman . Just keep moving . Hey , does Newman know about this , or what ? Listen , we 're just following orders . From who ? From the top , or from Locke ? I 'm not at liberty to say . Not at liberty to say . After you . Okay . Back off . We 're on the same side , remember ? What is the matter with Jason ? I mean , I know love does strange things to people but this is crazy . Well , Newman will get us out of here . Yeah , if he hears about it . What do you mean , " if " ? I 've got the distinct feeling he wasn 't consulted on this . Great . Just beautiful . So , what do we do ? Sit around and wait ? No . We figure a way to get out of here . I think Jason 's in trouble . I think he put us in here to gain time . Let 's see if we can get these lights apart . I thought this place was escape-proof . Well , let 's hope this is the one time the Company did a lousy job . Do you need prompting ? I am in control . Congratulations , Doctor . Thank you . Mr. Locke was my most difficult subject so far . I have no doubt that you will succeed . Your Behavior Modification System will soon prove its worth . Once we break Mr. Locke , Airwolf will be ours , and then nothing can stop us . Don 't fight me , Katherine , he 's already on his way . You promise you won 't hurt him ? If you do as you 're told , I won 't have to . Do it , Katherine . Good girl . Begin . I 'm all right , Jason . I 'm here with Dr. Robertson . Come and get me . Kate ! My God , Kate ! Are you hurt ? No , I 'm fine . It 's safe here . Bring Airwolf here to the institute . Dr. Robertson has a place all ready for it . Airwolf will be safe here . Hurry , Jason . Hurry . I 'm coming , Kate . Hang on ! Very good , my dear . Damn you ! He 's bringing it right to us . Excellent . Keep me informed . MIKE : Well , just so that it 's not a total loss , I know a fellow who needs a circus act . Here . ( EXCLAIMS ) Jeez ! I 'm going to need a screwdriver . You know , there 's something that tickles me about using a Company toy to break out of Company headquarters . That ought to do it . SAINT JOHN : All right , let 's get to work . Kate ! Thank God . Thank God you 're safe . Jason , I 'm so sorry . Welcome back , Mr. Locke . What is happening here ? All of this will make perfect sense once you fully understand . So , this is the mighty Airwolf . The Company was always so hush-hush about it . What have you done ? Release the security lock ! First you fill me in on what 's going on . Take him inside ! You said you wouldn 't hurt him ! Now , tell me what 's going on . Put away your gun , Mr. Locke . The access code ! Give it to me . I can 't ... KATE : Stop it ! He 's not responding . Your programming is being blocked by his own will power . You will have to overcome the blocks . If I use more power , his brain will be damaged . You are still within safe limits . I won 't give you Airwolf ! You have much to learn , Mr. Locke . ( SCREAMING ) Ready ? A little drum roll , please . JO : Escape-proof , huh ? Nobody 's perfect . It 's a good thing . Come on . LOCKE : You lied to me . You lied to me and now they have Airwolf . We gotta get out of here . It 's no use . We 've got to try . You felt the pain . Dr. Robertson can make us do anything she wants . I can 't believe how stupid I was . How could you do this to me ? I was trapped , just like you were . Come off it ! You expect me to believe that ? I never wanted to get you involved any more than you wanted to bring them Airwolf . I trusted you ! I trusted you ! I 'm so sorry . God , I 'm so scared . I know . I 'll get you out of here . He 's out there somewhere . In Airwolf . I still can 't believe he would have taken her . Oh , come on , Nova Seven . I 'll take back everything I ever said about you , come on . There she is . I 'll run up the closest grid pattern . Jason said he and Kate were driving that way last weekend . Just before he went strange on us . See who 's running the place and run a cross-match on the name . JO : I 'm way ahead of you . Dr. Sylvia Robertson . Selective behavior modification ? As in brainwashing ? Kate used to be her assistant . Are you thinking what I 'm thinking ? Yep . Jason flew Airwolf right into that head-laundry . Let 's get him out of there . His will is strong . He 's fighting the control . Then you will have to increase the power on the SBM . He must be under our complete control . Yes , but at what cost ? If we destroy his mind in the process , we 'll have nothing . Some things are worth the risk . I want the Airwolf , Doctor . I need it . There 's someone I want you to meet . Good evening , Mr. Locke . I 've heard a lot about you . This is the Leader , Mr. Locke . The hope for the salvation of the world . I don 't know who you are , but you 're both crazy . Jason , don 't . You can be a part of the new beginning with us , Mr. Locke . You , me , and Airwolf . So , that 's what this is all about . It 's not what you think . With Airwolf 's speed and abilities , we can travel the world , teaching a new , more peaceful way to live . Right . Your way . Everybody with bugs in their head , and you pushing the buttons . Well , you can get yourself another chauffeur . Jason , be careful , please . He can hurt you . Who are you ? I am John F. Kennedy . I am Martin Luther King . I am Gandhi . I am King Solomon . I am Julius Caesar . I am all of these men and more . I am the Leader . My God . You 're a machine . The Leader is more than a machine , he 's infallible . He is my supreme gift to the world . It is true , Dr. Robertson created me . However , I have far surpassed even her brilliant mind . I am truly the supreme being . This terminal is only the tip of the iceberg . The basement of this building is filled with data banks holding the collective genius of all the greatest leaders history has known . All of it combined into this single brilliant mind . I am the salvation of the world . And you will be my wings . I 'd rather be dead . The choice is yours . ( HIGH-PITCHED WHINING ) Stop it ! What are you doing ? Only with Airwolf 's electronic capabilities will I be truly mobile . He must learn to obey . I have taken over complete control . Make it stop ! You 're killing him ! It 's not me ! It 's the Leader ! I can 't stop it ! Kate ... Go ! Go for help ! Now ! No ! DR. ROBERTSON : Oh , my God . You killed her . Well , there doesn 't seem to be a whole lot happening in there . Airwolf has to be in one of these outer buildings . Let 's move . I 'll try and get inside and find Jason . Leave us alone for a few moments . So , Doctor , when did murder become part of the Hippocratic oath ? Katherine 's death was the last thing I wanted . I feel her loss deeply , Mr. Locke . Don 't give me that crap ! You killed her because she wouldn 't let you hurt me . You have no more feelings than that machine you obey . I regret to say you are no longer under my care . The Leader has control of the Selective Behavior Module . So , the puppet master has become the puppet . I suggest you give us the code to access Airwolf . ( HIGH-PITCHED WHINING ) ( GASPING ) The pain you feel will increase steadily . The pressure on your brain will become so great , you will suffer hallucinations and quickly lose all sanity . Please , Mr. Locke . Give us the code to Airwolf . We 've already suffered one needless tragedy here today . I 'm going to make sure you pay for Kate 's death , if it 's the last thing I do . He isn 't giving in . He is a particularly resistant subject . I am impressed . I would have expected collaboration by now . Now that Kate is dead , we have nothing to threaten him with . He is suffering only physical , not emotional sensations . Then we will have to tap his instinctual desire for self-preservation . If we increase the pain , you risk destroying his brain . He won 't be able to recall the access code to the helicopter . Mr. Locke will break . The hallucinations are extremely vivid . ( GASPING ) No ! ( POUNDING AT DOOR ) JO : Getting a reading ? Yeah . She 's inside here . Solid as a rock . Ah ! There 's another way in . Once we get Airwolf , we can blast our way out . If she hasn 't been disabled . ( SCREAMING ) Stop it ! You can 't affect him ! You 'll kill him before he gives in . His will can be broken . Turn it off ! You 'll kill him ! ( SCREAMING ) We must have Airwolf to become mobile . Have you forgotten our objectives , Doctor ? Our objective is peace , not random murder ! Turn it off or I will ! You 're exhibiting signs of irrationality , Doctor . A human trait which I am not burdened with . ( DR. ROBERTSON SHRIEKS ) I am in control , Doctor . Hey ! ( GRUNTING ) ( SCREAMING ) Jason ! ( SCREAMING ) Jason ! What is it , Jason ? The Leader ... The Leader has me . Who is the Leader , Jason ? Concentrate ! Answer me ! Computer ... Computer program ... Stop the Leader . Kate ... Kate is dead . All right , Jason , can I let you go ? Come on . We 've got to get out of here . Airwolf has been seized . There was an intruder here , Doctor . This whole operation is out of control . We must stop it . Now . No . You have betrayed me . You must pay the price . Hang on . I 'm getting a message from Saint John . I 've got Jason . We 've got Airwolf . Let 's get out of here ! We 've got to kill the computer first . Find the power source . As soon as we clear the building , blow it . Okay . This is one way to make an exit . I cannot be stopped . I am the Leader . My mission must be completed . You are all expendable . ( GRUNTING ) Fight it , Jason . Fight it . We 're armed and ready . There it is . Sub-basement , northwest corner . We 're targeting northwest corner . Now ! I cannot be stopped . I am the Leader . The ... The ... The ... The ... I am John F. Kennedy . I am John F. Kennedy . I am John F. Kennedy . ( STUTTERING ) I cannot be stopped . I cannot be stopped . Ah ... Ah ... Ah ... Ah ... I am the Leader . I am the Leader . I am the Leader . Jason ! Come on , Jason , talk to me . It 's gone . The pain is gone . Okay , you 're going to be all right , Jason . Come on down . We 've to get Jason to a hospital , fast . You think he 's all right ? It 's been a month now . I 'm going to talk to him . He 's taken it pretty hard , huh ? The doctor said there was no permanent damage . He was lucky . I mean Kate . It 'll take time . Take a lot more than that . Hey , that 's supposed to be my job . It 's okay . I need the practice . You 're going to have to snap out of this , you know . I 'll be all right . You sure ? No . I keep waiting for the hurting to stop . It does eventually . You just have to fill the emptiness with happy memories . I loved her , Jo . But I can never know how she felt about me . I mean , I 'll never know if it was her , or just Robertson pushing the buttons . I saw the two of you together . What you and Kate had came from the heart . It was real . Thanks .

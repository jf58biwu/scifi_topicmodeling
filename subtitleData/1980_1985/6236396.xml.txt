 'Mac , come in . Do you hear me ? 'Where are you ? ' I hear you fine . We 're just buzzing around Manhattan . What 's bugging you ? Radio ' Got a job for you . It 's urgent . 'You 've got a ship , The Caribbean Lady 'heading towards the Verezzano Bridge . 'It 's not answering our radio calls . 'Check it out , will you ? ' Yeah . Will do . We 're heading for the harbour now . En route . Going UP - 'Look , haul ass , will you , Mac ? 'The old man 's called me six times already . ' We 're over Lady Liberty . What 's the background , please ? 'You have no background . 'The harbour master spoke to the captain last night 'and told him to wait for permission to enter the harbour . 'Since then , we haven 't had a word . 'And now they 're just heading right up the straits . ' Maybe the radio 's busted . 'Maybe . But the captain knows the rules . 'He should 've stopped in the bay . 'Instead , he 's coming in like gangbusters . ' Ah , they must 've smoked the stuff they 're smuggling . I 'll go wake ' em up . 'Do that . ' There . There 's the ship . We got a sighting . You 're right . She 's coming in fast . That 's against every regulation in the book . The captain 's a real turkey . We 're going in for a closer look . I 'll get back to you . 'Mac , the suspense is killing me . What do you see ? ' There 's not a soul in sight . Really weird . 'No signs of damage or fire ? ' Nah ... nothing . Whatever happened to the crew , it was sudden . 'What the hell do you mean by that ? 'What about the lifeboats ? ' Well , they 're all there . I guess you 'd better send a tug right out . 'Gotcha , Mac . Will do . ' Alert the doctors . Put the ship in quarantine at an isolated dock . 'Right . We 'll follow standard emergency procedure . ' Understood . 'Tug 's on its way . How much time have we got ? ' Hurry UP - Sorry , this is a restricted area . They told me to come here . I 'm Dr Turner , of the health department . Ah , right . The lieutenant 's waiting for you over there . - Lieutenant ? - Ah , Doctor . Thanks for getting here so quickly . I 'm Lieutenant Arras . Pleasure to meet you . So , this is the mysterious vessel . Right , the Caribbean Lady . A tug caught up with her in the straits . Put a man on her and he shut down the engines . The captain , the crew ? There wasn 't a soul on board . Just this weird smell . Like something rotting . Sounds right out of Conrad . Where was she coming from ? The tropics . We 're checking on it now . We 'll have to make a hygiene check on the cabins . Lieutenant , I can 't work without witnesses . You 'll be coming with me ? Where 's that ? On the vessel ! Well , I 'd rather go ice skating at Rockefeller Center , but the captain said I was to take my orders from you , which doesn 't leave me much choice . Let 's get into protective clothing . I wanna go home . The sooner the better . Let 's go and see what this mystery 's all about . Lead on , Doc . We might as well split up . Charlie , you and the officer with you , stay at the front end of the ship . We 'll check the bridge . Doc , it 's like something out of a movie . It 's a ghost ship . This doesn 't make any sense . Didn 't you tell me that the captain radioed in last night that everything was normal ? The whole crew just doesn 't disappear into thin air . Ah , here 's the logbook . Let 's see what it says . Here we are ... The last entry 's dated last night . It says they 're 15 days out of home port and expect to dock in New York within 24 hours . Visibility is good , mild south-easterly wind , about seven knots , sea moderately calm . No mention of the crew . And it 's signed by the captain , P ... I don 't get it . Where is everybody , then ? " Signed , Pedro Mendez " . Whatever happened , it must 've happened all of a sudden . Otherwise , it 'd be written here in the log . Looks like it might be the officers ' mess . What do you say we check it out ? That 's what we 're here for . - Me first ? - You first . That 's what I thought you 'd say . Well , here goes . There 's nobody here , Doc . Let 's try the next one . I think we 'd better take a closer look . We 'll be here all night , at this rate . What the hell happened to these people ? Well , from the evidence , they stopped eating in the middle of their meal and jumped overboard . Next you 'll be saying it was something they ate . Funny , Doc . I wonder where this door leads to . Shall we try it ? That 's what we 're here for . - You wanna go first ? - Come on . Come on , open it . It 's stuck . Ugh ... Judging by his uniform , that 's our friend Mendez . The captain . Yeah , he hasn 't been dead for long either . The way he was closed in there , it 's as if he was trying to hide from something . He looks ... as if he was ... completely torn apart . Who do you think could have done that to him ? I wish I knew , Lieutenant . But look at the way his skin and clothes are torn . It 's almost as if ... I don 't know , it 's almost as if he exploded . E-exploded ? Yeah , but not because of a bomb . It 's more like he exploded from inside . Look at his stomach and his chest ... It 's as if some force inside just let loose . Ugh . Let 's search the rest of the boat . Come on . Nothing here . This one 's empty . What 's in here ? Hey , Doc . Come here ! I 've found some more . My God . Look at ' em ! Completely torn apart ! I 'll tell you one thing , Lieutenant : No disease or virus can reduce a man to this state in such a short time . I mean , according to the logbook , up until last night , everything on board was normal , right ? Harvey , call headquarters and tell them we may have an epidemic on our hands , and hurry ! Yes , sir . You see that ? He 's just like the other two . Harris was right . This wasn 't caused by any virus , that 's for damned sure . What the hell could it have been , then ? I mean ... down below ... and , man , it 's really weird . It looks like they blew up or something . He 's right , Lieutenant . And there 's this trail of green gunk that leads into the hold . - Green gunk ? - Sure . We didn 't want to follow it without telling you first . - Is the door open ? - Sure . Let 's go and have a look , then . This hold 's full of coffee . " UNIVERX " . Strange name for Colombian coffee . What do you think , Lieutenant ? What do I know from coffee ? I never drink the stuff . What is strange is this . It 's a different lettering . Doesn 't seem strange to me . It 's probably just a trademark . Of course . This place gives me the creeps . Right . What about those 20 bodies upstairs ? Let 's go . Whatever killed those men , it certainly wasn 't coffee . Hey , wait a minute . What 's that over there ? That 's not coffee . - What are they , Doc ? - I don 't know . But whatever they are , they came out of this case of coffee . Do you think the rest of these cases are filled with those things ? You won 't know until you look , but at last we 've found something , besides the missing crew , that doesn 't add up . Well , what do you think they are , Doc ? They could be something like , er ... Like a giant squash or ... avocado or ... or some kind of mango . They look like big green eggs to me . Doc , there 's one over there , look . - Where . - Under the pipes . It 's bigger than the other ones . And it 's pulsating . As if it had a heartbeat . They 're hot . Most likely these pipes carry steam or hot water . I 'm only making a guess , of course , but heat must have an effect on these things , causing them to ripen . That would explain why the others are still green ... and smaller . Hey , like in a hothouse . Think these have anything to do with those guys being killed , huh ? I really don 't know . We 'd have to examine them in a lab to be sure . I 'll go get you one . Don 't touch them ! It could be dangerous ! Hey , don 't worry . And as soon as I was informed , I gave orders to totally isolate the pier and place it under absolute maximum security . Good . Put emergency plan number seven into effect . Was General Hazon informed ? Yes , and a group of experts is already airborne . They should be here in a couple of hours . What about the man who survived ? I believe he 's just about to be released from decontamination . He identifies himself as Lieutenant Arras of the police department . He 's the one who informed us . - I see . - After you , ma 'am . Have all decontamination procedures been completed ? Another five minutes , ma 'am . Colonel , he 's undergone all the necessary preliminaries . At this point , he shouldn 't have any abnormal or active microorganisms on his body . Right . If the type we 're dealing with is something we already know about . I don 't know what I 'm doing in this stinking place , but I swear that when I get outta here , you 're all gonna pay for the way you 're treating me ! Control yourself . You can hear me ? You can hear me ! You have the nerve to come in here and tell me to control myself ! They 've been giving me a smoke cure . Wearing me out , washing me down for six hours . Then they leave me here to freeze my balls off ! And now you come in and dare to tell me to keep myself controlled , baby ? Don 't call me " baby " , young man . And you don 't call me a " young man " , babe . It might not show right now , but I 'm a police lieutenant . Got that ? And I 'm a colonel . Internal Security , responsible directly to the president . Special Division Five . Any other comments , Lieutenant ? No , sir . Er ... No , ma 'am . At ease , Lieutenant . Yes , ma 'am . I 'm sorry . There is no reason for you to salute me . Thank you . As of this moment , I am in complete charge of the Caribbean Lady case . Now , exactly what did you see on board ? You talked about eggs . Is that correct ? Er , well ... As a matter of fact , they did look like eggs . But the size of pumpkins . Kinda like footballs , and ... there were all these cases ... with ' UNIVERX ' written on the side of them , hundreds of ' em . - The whole of the ship 's cargo ? - Yes , sir . Er , yes , ma 'am . I think so , I ... One of the cases had dropped to the ground and one of the eggs had rolled just under a large pipe . And then ... Well , it was ripening . What do you mean ? Well , it was different from the others . It was ... Well , it was almost like ... alive . It wasn 't as green , and ... and that was the one which sprayed all its substance on the poor doctor , and made him all ... I need one of those eggs immediately . But we 'll have to be very careful how we do it . Squad Two . - Hey , you 're going to freeze it ? - Yes . And the whole cargo with it . I don 't know what ... what kind of organism we 're dealing with , but , er ... whatever substance there is in these eggs will be neutralised by deep freezing . Then , we 'll ... we 'll see . Yes , well , I 'll take care of that immediately . Hey ... Er ... Talking about deep freezing , can I have my clothes ? For security reasons , your personal effects were destroyed . You 'll be issued an overall . Overalls ? Overalls ? What about my credit cards ? My Gucci watchstrap ? My wallet ? My badge ? My badge ? I gotta pay ... Make sure he gets dressed and give him a room in the officers ' quarters . There . That must be the thing that killed those men . Macmillan . The tongs , ma 'am . Young , you do it . The first examinations all show the same results . This is not an egg but an intensive culture of unknown bacteria . Pathogenous , perhaps , but definitely deadly . - Artificial ? - I still don 't know . But what we might define as the egg 's yolk is a preset materialization culture . It reacts to heat . When the temperature is raised , it undergoes a cell mutation and becomes deadly . - How ? - Come over here . Now watch . As you can see , I am extracting a sample of the substance from the interior of the egg . What is that stuff ? That stuff 's what caused those deaths , right ? Right . It 's 100 % active . Now watch . I am now going to inject some of the fluid into this white rat . Now all we have to do is wait . It takes effect almost immediately . My God , I saw it happen to human beings . It was horrible . Do you have any idea ... why and how this happens ? I need more time for tests . If you need any help , there 's no problem . The Defense Department can open any door . I could use Hilton , at the University of Michigan . He 's the top expert on artificial bacterial culture and mutations . We can get him here in three hours . Put the wheels in motion , Young . I 'll see what I can do . I feel responsible . If I had only notified you when that ship was being towed in ... there would 've been ... three deaths less . And you would 've had more time to investigate . I don 't think it was your job to notify me , Lieutenant . - Can I go ? - No . You stay here . What else can I do ? Don 't sell yourself short . You 're not going home . I need you . Well , if I 'm really that necessary ... Of course , I could get much better collaborators than you . But ... you 've been involved in this since the very beginning and I 'm sure you 'll understand , it has to be kept absolutely secret . Is that clear ? Yes . I 'm afraid so , yes ... Where do we start ? First , we have to find out who was supposed to receive this lethal cargo . I 've already checked it out . It 's an import-export company . No offices . Just a warehouse in the Bronx . I think they planned to put them in the sewers . - Sewers ? - Yes , sewers . They 're just as warm , damp , and comfortable as an enormous incubator . Imagine a hundred of those eggs scattered in the New York sewers . It would blow up the city in one night ! Wait a minute . The ship wasn 't to unload until tomorrow morning . Right . Whoever 's receiving this cargo may not know yet . We might still catch them by surprise . Da Silva . You go first . Open up ! Open up ! There 's somebody in there . I 'm sure of it . It 's probably a ... a watchman . What 's all the racket ? Who is it ? Open up . We have a warrant to search these premises . OK ... OK , OK . Young ! Fire ! Drop your guns ! You 're surrounded . There 's no way out . Keep moving ! No . You stay here . Call in the flamethrowers . Flamethrowers ? Why ? It 's the best way to destroy all those eggs . I want you to burn everything . First you freeze the ones on the ship , now you 're burning these . You don 't believe in half measures , do you ? I 'm only doing my job . You must know by now that national security is at stake . And possibly even more than that . Since I last saw you , Dr Hilton and I have successfully analysed the yolk of the egg . There . These are segmented dodecahedric cells . You know , they never showed us anything like that , back in school . In fact , they don 't exist in nature . Not in our nature . Nor in the mutations we have been able to achieve , up till now . The cells of the eggs in question have structures based on silicon , whereas all Earth organisms have cells that are based on carbon . Earth organisms ? I don 't believe these belong to our planet . Do you mean ... they come from outer space ? Why not ? How many worlds are there in the universe ? Millions . Perhaps billions . True , they 're millions of light years away . But perhaps a form of life like this doesn 't have the same concept of time as we do . It stays inactive . Passive . As long as it 's in the absolute freezing temperature of sidereal space . Then , once it falls into an atmosphere like ours , the seeds germinate and the eggs grow . If you 're talking about cells wandering in infinity , they have one chance in several billion of falling on our planet . That 's practically impossible . Unless ... Unless they come ... from much closer , but ... Of course ! Of course . Try to imagine it had all happened , not because ... the seeds to create the eggs came to us , but because we went to them . A man could quite easily have brought the seeds here . But a man would never do anything like that . Well , those Bronx warehouse guards might have been crazy , subjugated , but they were men . They 're not even astronauts ! They couldn 't have gone into space and come back without anybody knowing . But we have known about it . We 've always known about it . Don 't you remember ? The Mars mission . Hubbard , the English astronaut in the international project which first investigated the red planet , came back to Earth a little crazy . He said strange things had happened at the Martian Pole . But the other astronaut , Hamilton , said that Hubbard dreamt it up . Do you remember what else Hubbard said ? He spoke of ... My God , now I remember ! He talked about eggs . Eggs . Oval ... longish ... eggs . Eggs like footballs . Like that one over there . I believe Hubbard was not as crazy as we all thought he was . Me included . Now ... we have to find Hubbard as quickly as possible . Are you sure this is the house ? Yes . This is the last address we have in our police files . I 'd rather go up alone . You wait for me here . - All right . If you need me , just whistle . - OK . Why did she want to go up alone ? Well , Colonel Holmes was on the committee that interrogated Hubbard after his space trip . And , er ... Well , she was the one who actually suggested that he was crazy . Maybe she just feels responsible . Almost a human reaction . We 've met before , Commander Hubbard . I 'm Stella Holmes . Colonel Holmes . Special Division Five . You 're exactly what I need . Well , what do you want with me ? Haven 't you put me through enough already ? - Oh , shut up , Hubbard . That 's enough . - You goddamn ... Your bitterness is quite understandable . Considering I was on one of the commissions that interrogated you . Interrogated ? You mean " judged and convicted " , don 't you ? Kicked out of the service like some ... some crazy , lying visionary . Well , what are you doing here anyway ? Idle curiosity ? Well , come on , Colonel . What is it you want to know ? How many times a week I screw ? If you 're always in this condition , it 's quite obvious you couldn 't get it up , even if you used a crane . - What do you want ? - Information . And we need it immediately . Because time is of the essence . This is a very serious matter . Here . Do you recognise these ? Why are you bothering to torment me ? I thought this case was over and done with long ago . It 's closed ! These are your drawings . This is what you claim you saw on Mars . Right ? Why don 't you just leave me alone ? I never saw anything . I don 't know what Mars is and I was never there . I know what you went through . Shame , dishonour ... Everybody was against you and treated you like you were a hallucinating madman . And you were with them . Right in the front row . Yes , I remember you , Dr Holmes . I remember you really well . With your ... ironic , head-of-the-class attitude . Always so sure of yourself . - Always so goddamn ... - Presumptuous and idiotic . You 're right ... Now I know . You were ... telling the truth . All along . Does this resemble what you saw ? But ... But these are photographs ! But there hasn 't been another expedition to Mars . No ... These were found here . On Earth . Thousands of them . - Here ? - Yes . In the United States . We found them by chance . And burned them . But ... how many of them are left , where , exactly what they are , we don 't know . Hubbard , you 're the only one who can help us . You said you saw them on Mars . You do remember , don 't you ? It was all ... it was all such a long time ago . What happened on Mars two years ago ? You knew our mission . 'When we reached Mars , we landed at the polar ice cap . 'Hamilton and I decided to look around , 'and after a while , we ... 'we came to a ... an opening . 'A cave , in a mountain of ice . ' And ... and then ... - We ... - What happened after that ? It 's ... it 's confused . It 's ... It 's difficult to remember . - ' Come on ... - ' We went into the cave and ... 'it was dark and ... strangely humid and ... 'it was there we saw the eggs . 'God , there were so many . 'They were green . Just like the one in your photograph . 'And , then ... from the back of the cave , 'we heard a noise , 'as if something was approaching . 'Something ominous . 'And it radiated a light . 'As it moved towards us , 'it was slowly filling the cave 'with this ... blinding , hypnotic light . 'As it came towards us I ... 'looked at Hamilton and ... 'his eyes ... 'He ... he was beginning ... 'Hamilton was beginning to ... 'Hamilton ! ' 'Mars has always stimulated man 's imagination . 'It is a common belief that if there was other life in our solar system , 'that it would be on Mars . 'H.G. Wells imagined Martians as flying monsters , 'which invaded Earth . 'Others have pictured them as little green men . 'But as far as that cave was concerned , 'there was absolutely nothing in there . 'No life forms . 'Only rock and ice , like everything else we found up there . 'Therefore ... 'I 'm sorry to contradict my colleague Hubbard . 'Our mission ... 'Our mission was almost beyond human limits . 'I came close to a nervous breakdown too . More than once . 'I was ... 'I was just luckier than my poor friend . That 's all . ' Son of a bitch . He even convinced me . Now we know that Hamilton lied . But I don 't understand . If he did see those eggs , why didn 't he confirm it ? I think it 's best we question Hamilton . Er ... we would if we could . I only wish it was possible , but I ... I don 't have the gift of bringing corpses back to life . Hamilton died six months ago . What ? Yes . His private airplane crashed off the coast of Florida . In that case , Colonel , what the hell does that leave us with , then ? Hubbard ? You saw the state he 's in . And we know now he actually saw the eggs . Only , I have the feeling we have to take this investigation in another direction . What are you gonna do ? Well , I have one plan . If I can get the Pentagon to ... to give me the authorisation . Call the airport . Reserve three seats on the first flight . Tourist class . We 're like regular passengers . Invent three names and have three passports ready . Got it . Washington okay it ' ? Yes . But with strings , as usual . They gave me 72 hours to solve the case . Then they 'll blow the whistle with a general alarm and call a special session of the Security Council . That means that the ... people who have the eggs will have plenty of time to ... - ... find another nest . - Right . We 've got to get to them first . Luckily , we already have one lead . You mean , er ... the coffee company in South America ? Very good . Well , I 'm glad to know that you 're not such an idiot , after all ... since I 've decided to take you along with me ... Hmm ... It 's great to hear your superior 's appreciation . Really . We 're leaving right away . Go get ready . Oh , no problem . I travel light . Go up and your hairbrush . OK ? Oh , I get it ... You two would prefer to be , er ... alone . See ya later . And , oh ... have fun . What about you ? Do you want to come ? Mmm ... I dropped out a long time ago . Didn 't you put your signature on my discharge too ? I 've already had you reinstated in full . Doesn 't that salve the wound ? Oh , I don 't give a damn ! What do you want from me ? With all my diplomas and official recommendations , I 'm still a wreck . OK . Then you can just go stew in your own juice . Wallow in self-pity . But I thought that ... under that wreck there was still a man . A man who had the guts to go to Mars . A man who fought to the end for what he believed was right . A man who could help us save this frail planet from a fate worse than death . But that man remained on the glaciers of Mars and this whiskey-soaked wreck is just empty ... - If you were a man , I 'd ... - What would you do ? Nothing . You 'd do nothing , Hubbard , because you 're incapable of doing anything . You 're too soft . You 're half a man . That 's just so that we understand one another . Yes ... I believe we do understand one another . Now ... what about that little trip to South America ? They 've arrived . They 're at the Grand Hotel . In three separate rooms . On the second floor . I don 't know who the guy in the middle is , but he looks like a cop . The woman is Stella Holmes . A first-class mind . Too bad . And then ... Well , what do you know ? My old friend Hubbard , the last survivor of the Mars expedition . He 's the only one we haven 't gotten , up to now . But his turn will come . What do you intend to do ? Don 't worry , dear . They haven 't found anything out yet . We 're running this game . They 're on our territory , so let 's start by sending a little welcoming gift . Miss Holmes is first . This is the location of the coffee factory . If this is their headquarters , the egg plantation should be somewhere in this area . Well , if they are there , I 'll find them . Right . You fly over the area tomorrow morning . Arras and I will inspect the coffee factory . But don 't take anything for granted . Remember , we 're dealing with something from beyond our planet . And we 've already lost a whole day , travelling . Well , we can make up for it tomorrow . Well , we 're in big trouble if we don 't , and the rest of humanity along with us . Well , this particular piece of humanity is gonna be in trouble if it doesn 't get something to eat pretty soon . - Let 's say in half an hour . - Why not now ? I want to change and wash before . Jesus Christ . The whole world is gonna be wiped out and all this broad 's worried about is getting changed ! Listen , Arras . If I have to die with the rest of the world , then I want to have a proper dress on and clean underwear . Hmm ... I think what the colonel 's trying to tell you is that there are some people who travel with more than just a comb and a pair of pyjamas . But ... I don 't wear pyjamas ! Out ! I want to have a shower . Gut ! Gut ! Both of you ! What a waste of a good-looking woman . Is something wrong with her or is she just , erm , married ? Yeah . To a test tube and a whip . You know , I don 't think the colonel would 've been out of place in that snow cave on Mars . You know , all women are alike . All over the world . It 's just a question of handling them properly . Now , I treat all women gently . Don 't worry . I have no intention of trying . I 'm , er , warm-blooded . I don 't like the cold . Well , I 'll see you at dinner . In half an hour . Good . Bye ! I thought you didn 't like the cold ... Hey , you were right . I 'd better turn off the air conditioner . That 's not the only thing you should turn off . OK , OK . - I 'll come and get you when I 'm ready . - Right . Hey ! Who 's there ? Oh , my God ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Hello ? Erm ... Could you give me the number of the local airport , please ? Help ! Ah , yes . Operator ? Please ... Miss Stella Holmes , Room 227 . Thank you . Help ! Help ! Get me out of here ! There 's an 699 ! Hubbard ! I 'm sorry , sir . That room does not answer . Well , it doesn 't matter . All right . Thank you . - Ready ? - Yes . I was just waiting for you . Are we going to eat here , in the hotel ? Or do you think we 'll go somewhere else ? Well , I expect it will be exactly what the colonel decides . Weren 't we supposed to meet her here ? Oh , come on , we 'll eat by ourselves . - Yeah , but she ... - No , no , no . Come on , Casanova . She can order something for herself on room service . What ? An ice cream ? It 's not her style not to keep an appointment . Yes , when I put up a " Do Not Disturb " sign , I usually intend to do more serious things than just take a shower . What 's the matter , huh ? I 'm not sure , but ... Maybe we had better knock . Hey , come on . What if she 's sleeping ? Don 't worry . I 'll take the blame . Help ! Help ! Get me out of here ! There 's an 699 ! Hubbard ... Help ! Get me out of here ! Just a little . Bon appétit . Thank you . - This is a local specialty . - Oh ? I had them make it up as a treat for you . To celebrate the unfortunate demise of Miss Holmes . What 's wrong ? The egg ... The egg ! But ... What happened to the egg ? I can feel it inside me , like before . Another one of our creatures has been sacrificed . It was completely useless . That woman is still alive ! But ... that 's impossible ! I know she is ! I can feel her . She 's alive . The egg failed to kill her ! Out ! Everyone out ! Leave me alone ! You too ! Out ! This place is so goddamn sinister . I feel like ... somebody is scratching my head , but from the inside . That could mean we 're on the right track . Yeah ... It could also mean that we 're heading straight into a goddamn trap . Would you feel any safer if we had the whole Marine Corps to help us ? What you don 't understand , Colonel , is that I 'm no hero . Just your average Brooklyn cop . Hello . We 're the ones who phoned earlier . Are you Mr Gomez ? No , senor . Mr Gomez is over there . Hey , Mr Gomez . These are the Americans who called you about the coffee . This is Mr Gomez . Hi . Name 's Arras . Pleased to meet you . - Hello , Mr Gomez . - Where do we go ? Inside ? Right this way . As you can see , we use the most modern equipment . And now ... the plant is separated into several departments , Each with its own responsibility . You know , in here is where we toast the coffee to different degrees , according to where we export it . And what is this ? Why this is a toasting oven . Three tons at a time . Imagine that . You know , three tons of coffee can make a lot of people very nervous . Er ... senora ... This gentleman and lady would like information about our coffee . Yes . I was waiting for them . You can go . I 'm Perla de la Cruz , the owner . How can I be of help ? Oh , yes . We would like to buy a large amount of your coffee . You know ... somebody told us that here you toast a very special brand of coffee . Yes . A very , very special kind . You just sent some to New York . On a cargo ship called the Caribbean Lady . - Yes . - Really ? Yes . Doesn 't that name mean anything to you ? Frankly , no . We send shipments all over the world . However , if you would like to see the various kinds of coffee we produce , please follow me . - All right ... - Then you can choose the one you like . Great idea . We have a complete production operation here . From picking to packaging . Including instant and decaffeinated coffee . Everything is controlled by computers . Each unit is vacuum-packed and contains exactly two hundred grams . This way , please . This where the bulk coffee is unloaded and stored before processing . We have our own coffee plantation nearby . Fascinating , isn 't it ? And now ... we have arrived . Arrived ? What does that mean ? All your questions will be answered here . Now it 's clear who cultivates those eggs . It 's you , isn 't it ? Yes . But I 'm not alone . I 'm the head of the operation . Hamilton ! Alive ! It 's pity you won 't be able to tell anyone . One map ... and one ... flare pistol . Arras ... Yes , Colonel Holmes . You can call me Stella . Thanks . - My name is Tony . - OK . Well , Tony ... If you had listened to your good old cop instinct , instead of my MIT-educated calculations ... I told you I felt something scratching inside my head , from the inside . ESP . I 'm the perfect subject . Maybe it 's because I 'm not too smart . Hm ? You know something ? Now I can tell you . You 've always made me feel like a caveman . You 're the first woman I ever went after that I couldn 't get past the first base with . I 'm sorry . Well , imagine how I feel . Turn around a little bit . That wasn 't much , I know . It 's the most fantastic thing ... that 's ever happened to me in my whole life . Who did this ? White zom ... zom ... White ... zom ... zombies ! White zombies ? Come on ! Follow me ! Come on . Hurry up ! Section A , take this cluster here . Section B , only pick the ones that are ripe . White zombies . Hurry up ! Hurry up ! Move it ! Pick those ones there . Get up . It 's time for you to come . Where ? To the Cyclops . Cyclops ? Yes . The Cyclops . Hey , you ! What are you doing ? You were assigned to ride in front . Come on , come on , get in . We 're leaving . Hundreds more are being picked right now . Everything will be ready in a few days . Then the eggs will be shipped , sent around the whole world . There won 't be any mistakes this time . No one will stop us . What 's the reason behind all this , Hamilton ? It doesn 't make sense . What 's the purpose behind any living being ? To grow . To multiply . Survive . Eat in order not to be eaten . Kill in order not to be killed . The strongest creature shall crush the weakest . That 's the purpose of this . - You 're not talking like a human being . - He 's not a human being . He was once , but ... he 's not any longer . You can 't understand me . A superior being speaks through me . It can wipe you outwith the mere power of its mind . No , not so superior . You were wiped out , Hamilton . Hubbard wasn 't . His mind resisted on Mars , and he can do it again . Here . And crush you and your damn master , whoever that monster is . He might have done it again . But his mind no longer exists , Colonel Holmes . All we had to do was crash his small plane . Hubbard is dead . Dead ? - Did everything go all right ? - Yes . We collected 240 eggs . Excellent . Let me see the checklist . It is my master who creates the eggs . He grew out of a tiny seed that I brought back from Mars . He creates the eggs and then the heat develops them to maturity . Go on ... He 's calling you . He wants you . Go ! Tony ... Tony ... Arras ... No ! Shut up ! - It 's useless . - Tony ! TOW. no ' . ! Resist it ! TOW. no ' . ! - Shut up ! - No ! You can 't do anything . Stop ! Tony ! Help ! Do not resist . Hubbard ! So , you know who I am . Then you also know that I 've got nothing to lose . Now , where do you incubate those eggs ? It 's too late . Hamilton has got your friends . Hamilton ? Yes ... your old friend Hamilton . Where are they ? Where ? In the forbidden room . Take me there . No ! Tony ! No ! No ! Oh , God ... Look . Look ! Look ! Go to it . It 's your turn . One word out of you and you 're dead . He 's a spy ! Kill him ! Stop ! Hamilton ! Watch out ! You shoot and you 'll get her ! No , Hamilton . Don 't shoot . Don 't do what the Cyclops wants ! Don 't shoot ! No ! Stella ! Damn you ! A Squad over there . C Squad go to the front . B Squad in the rear . We 're safe now . It 's finished . Come on . Hubbard ! OK , let 's go . Out . Move along , move along . It wasn 't his fault . Hamilton . No , the man you met , he was just an extension of that monster . Completely under its power from the moment that they first met one another in that Martian cave . So much so that they both died at the same time . But the real Hamilton ... He never returned to Earth . Yes , he 's still up there ... On Mars , the Cyclops star . From now on , it 'll be difficult to look at the sky ... without thinking that ... maybe somewhere ... up there ... there 's something waiting .

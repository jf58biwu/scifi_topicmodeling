 Wait a second , please . Yes . Here 's a clean uniform . It 's time you get out of these clothes . Hello Billy . It 's Felix . I never thought I 'd see you here , but I 'm sure they must have their reasons . Welcome home ! I hope we can talk undisturbed . He 's with me now . Yes , I 'll keep you posted . You 're aware of the fact that you 'll be held responsible for the catastrophe whether it was an accident or sabotage . Furthermore , you are accused of espionage . The facts will be hard to disprove . You 've made photos . They found a film . Who shot it ? And why was it in Eva 's possession ? Why are you leading the investigation ? If you think I enjoy this , you 're wrong . Why do you do it then ? Because I want to help you . Billy , what did you know about the whole thing ? - I do understand you . - You think so ? You were sucked into it and now you want to play hero but that will hurt you even more . They took me off that ship like I was some hardcore criminal . I think we know each other long enough , Billy . I think you should trust me . You 're making everything worse by not talking . You 're standing a chance getting out of this . I understand . You want an admission of guilt from me , so it will save your neck but I won 't do that . I think it 's just a little too easy for you , and I owe it to Max . What do you mean ? What do I mean ? Do you think Max would 've done it , if he knew it 'd be covered up afterwards ? Nobody is covering up anything . We all carry part of the blame . You , me , and Max as well . Part of it was destiny and we weren 't able to see the consequences how could we out there on Florida Arklab . Billy , Florida Arklab doesn 't exist anymore . That is our problem . Project C.O.R.A. , control zone delta , jurisdiction Florida Arklab . Inspection and program for the 10th of November . Captain Hayes , please come in . Captain Hayes , please come in . Captain Hayes , do you hear us ? Yes , I 'm on my way to Sector " B " . Okay , we are tracking you with the radar system . I 'm now in the zero-gravity zone . I 'll talk to you when I 'm at the reactor , over . Okay , copy , over . Israeli Intelligence and various correspondents report a military coup in Saudi Arabia . Eben Sadek , Major of the Saudi Arabian Air Force supposedly arrested Air Force commander , Ali Ahmed , as well as eleven other officers in the early morning hours at the Tabuk Airport near the Egyptian border . And now to breaking news from our correspondent in Riyadh . This military coup seems to ... This is RTC , please insert your tape . You will be on the air momentarily . Copy . I 'm almost ready , will wait for your signal . ... this concludes our report from Riyadh . And now the weather . Ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five four , three , two , one - go ! This is Max Marek on Florida Arklab . A broad cloud cover is moving from the northwest towards central Europe . Southern Europe and the Alps remain under clear skies . In the next few days though , this low will affect the weather here as well . The low approaching from the west will dominate the weather of central Europe . Warm and humid air will cause temperatures to rise . Reactor Segment-2 activated . Ace , insert control module 4 . That 's what I 'm doing . Control module 4 inserted . Reactor Segment-4 activated . And now control module 5 . Reactor Segment-5 activated . Reactor ready . I 'm reconnecting the American Sector to the reactor and general system . Okay , get ready for the radiator test . I 'm setting the automatic control . Countdown is running . Five , four , three , two , one ... Everything as scheduled . Radiator group two . Countdown is running . Five , four , three , two , one ... Felix , I had a bad feeling from the start during this test . Why was " B " Sector activated just a few days before our departure ? And why couldn 't Max know about it ? He was the one responsible . He was the one leading the program and successfully completing it . You knew that weather research was the most important thing to Max his life achievement . It was his last time up there , and he was proud of this damned CORA project . He was probably thinking about his future on this dark and small planet . All he cared about were his animals and plants while I trudged through " B " Sector secretly plotting against him . To this day I don 't know what possessed me to do this . I guess , too much time up there affected my brain I didn 't see what went on anymore . By the way , I liked being in " B " Sector . I don 't know if you understand ... this peace ... After each inspection I would go down to the former living quarters looking at belongings of the previous crew . You know , all the little things you bring along . The 5 lbs. of personal memories that you 're allowed to take . This is Felix would you tell me what you 're doing down there ? Over . Why ? I 'm done with today 's tasks . That doesn 't mean you can snoop around down there . Nobody 's snooping . I 'm just looking . No one asked you to . You are not authorized in the lower living quarters . I hope I made myself clear . - Have you heard from Max ? - Why ? Listen Billy , Max needs ... I clearly remember that it was you who got me into all this trouble . " Max is not supposed to find out . He is so tense and nervous lately . " You were right . He was tense and nervous . Did you smoke again ? But that was no reason to keep the planned radiation burst a secret . I already had enough problems . He was such a slob . Most of the time I spent cleaning up after him . Disgusting . I can 't take this pig-sty any longer . Aren 't you looking for Frankie-Boy for a week now ? Max , I got him ! He is skinny . Come on , say hello to the nice uncle . You little runaway . He doesn 't look too good . I don 't know what Billy told you , but nothing has been decided yet . There is talk that I may get this job , you know how important it is for me . Yes , I know and I am your biggest advocate . I 'm just upset that Billy couldn 't keep quiet . Why ? I 'm thankful for that . - We are doing all we can down here ... - Max , say it again please . Still looks the same . Well , if you can 't tell there 's no need to clean . I don 't have to tell you how long it might take till they make up their mind . It would be nice if you 'd tell me directly next time . Of course , Max . I hope Billy didn 't tell you any other nonsense . I want to send a private home service tape for Eva . Okay , but hurry . We have to send you the latest data of the initial CORA run . It 's running . I 'm looking forward to seeing you again , Eva . Unfortunately it will be only for a few days . I was thinking we have to change something , because we can 't go on like this . One of us has to finally quit this job . Florida Arklab , this is the MET project management . We are now transmitting the evaluation of the initial CORA run . - Are you ready ? - Yes , go ahead . Listen to the tape . Tape is running . This is an infra-red recording from an altitude of 190 km . You clearly see the formation of clouds . A large amount of cumulus clouds , 30 % above average . I 'm switching to automatic recording . Precipitation is equally ... This is fantastic , three days till the weather was back to normal . - Did you hear the news ? - No . Tell me , do you know what happened in Sector " B " ? No . - You really don 't know ? - No , I really don 't . What is it officially ? Technical defect combined with human failure . Couldn 't be more precise ... There is a different version , of course . Which is ? A reactor accident . Who says that ? Nobody , of course . But secrecy seems to be in fashion these days . Rebellious troops are approaching the capital of Riyadh where the royal army is preparing itself for the upcoming occupation . The many bomb victims were buried in mass graves to avoid an epidemic . Max , come on already ! Man , he 's playing cool again . They just show the same shit over again . Max ! I don 't understand why I like this game . You lose all the time . Again . Now I 'll do you in . You don 't have much to lose . You 're wrong my friend . The bunk needs to be cleaned , the shower ... Don 't forget the toilet or what you left of it . So this round is for the toilet . That 's it ! I almost forgot about the secret radiation test in the " B " Sector . In the last days political news from Saudi-Arabia was prominent . The Riyadh airport hostage situation made us hold our breath just as you . Though you live up here like on an island , far away from daily life shipwrecked , looking at the horizon each day for the end of your imprisonment . Despite that , I don 't understand my blindness . Why I didn 't see those vital signs . Any child could have seen what your intentions were . And I was the one setting the table . The secrecy of the past days must have had a reason . Our monitor shows reactor Segment-5 . Proceeding as planned . Preparation to operate B-System . Activate American Sector . Sector " B " is being activated . Countdown started . - Ten , nine , eight , seven ... - 1 : 47 minutes till target coordinates . ... four , three , two , one ... Hold on , we don 't have a control signal from the automatic pilot . - Switch to outside cameras . - In position , countdown starts . Ten , nine , eight , seven , six ... What 's with the radiators ? - They should be open by now ! - Yes . Negative . The radiators did not open . How about the second radiator group ? Hold on , we 'll see them in a sec ... 1 : 15 minutes till target coordinates . You have to alarm the crew . Can you get a hold of Felix ? As the official European representative of the CORA project , it has to be Felix . Max , hurry up ! Florida Arklab . This is Felix . Immediately get all data from lD-code Laurin ! Did you understand ? Identity code Laurin . What 's the problem ? Failure of the auto-control system in the American Sector . The radiators don 't open . You have to start radiation manually . There 's no time to re-program ! - What 's going on ? - Manual initial radiation . I have the data Marek , Florida Arklab . Your screen shows the radiation target . It 's an area in the Indian Ocean . The exact target coordinates are showing . As soon as Billy switches to manual , you have to open the radiators . Time is tight , but I 'm sure you can make it if you hurry . Max ? Max , do you copy ? Damned shit ! Mr. Marek , are you ready ? Mr. Marek ? - Why is this area being radiated ? - We don 't have time to chat . Mr. Marek , the countdown has started . You know what to do . What about Hayes ? Is he ready ? One second . Max , we 're ready . 25 seconds , okay . Marek , extend the radiators . Felix ... I want an answer first . Why is this area being radiated ? Max , don 't cause any trouble now . Open the radiators , I 'll explain later . Marek , this is an order ! Have you lost your mind ? Ten seconds . Radiator 1 extended . Radiator 2 extended . They did it . The radiation is in progress . Slowly , I began to understand yet the purpose of this operation was still not clear to me . How could it ? I was too busy keeping secret preparations from him . Radiation exposure : 27 minutes 40 seconds . Intensity : 54 B 7 . We are reducing index by 5 units . Reduce index by five units . Initial radiation reduced . Max , your coffee . Thank you . Exposure to radiation : 28 minutes 30 seconds . We 're reducing the radiation index by 4 more units . Copy , index reduced by 4 units . Initial radiation reduced . We 're almost ready . Radiation stop at 30 : 00 . Radiation - stop ! Finally . Deactivate reactor . - Retract microwave radiators . - Retracting . Initial radiation over . All automatic controls non-operational . Come on , get back down . Radiator group 1 and 2 retracting . Florida Arklab , this is the project base . We thank you for your prompt response and wish you a good night . You heard it , go back to sleep . We 'll talk in the morning . Felix ... Why did we do this radiation ? That 's of no interest , we 'll talk about it some time . Felix , I asked you a question and want a damned answer ! Listen closely . You were not supposed to be a part of this . Just forget about it and stop playing the wild man . Think about the lasting impression on your future employer ... I don 't care ! Are you blackmailing me ? No , I want to keep you from rash decisions . Felix , I 've been part of this research program for a long time . Now tell me ... I am sorry . I have to shut down the connection . Cut off ! Of course , man . - They want to go to bed , too . - This is the CORA management ... - Something 's wrong . - I was listening to your conversation . You are suspended from your functions until further notice . All access to results and data will be denied . I demand that you forget tonight 's events . You 're under strict confidentiality . There was no initial radiation ! - I recommend following these orders . - Who am I to take orders from them ? Felix ! Why did you react so harshly ? That 's what triggered it . Now , we both started wondering . Max lead all CORA projects as a scientist and part of a regular research program . So , what changed ? Only the purpose ... and the morals . Suddenly he wasn 't needed . Admit it , Felix . He was nothing more than a stupid , small risk factor . Billy , you misjudge my role in this game . Why are you here , then ? - Because I want to help you . - Stop it , Felix . Listen , I don 't want to hear anymore about it . Don 't you get it , down there ? We just want you to keep an eye on him . Just tell us , if he shows a little too much interest in particular things . - You know what I 'm talking about . - Stop it ! Don 't you start trouble , too . I 'm not and I don 't want to know ! I 'm packing our things and we 'll go home . You don 't know what goes on down here since the radiation . We 're not the head of the household up there . I noticed that . I have to go , Felix . The end . Time to clean this mess once again ! Damned shit , man ! Shit ! Billy , where are my clothes ? - I packed them ! - You expect me to run around naked ? Hand me back my clothes . Be careful not to get freezer-burn down there . I couldn 't possibly know about their plans . You certainly didn 't tell me ! - Didn 't tell ... - And I 'm not hard of hearing ! Felix made it quite clear . Keep an eye on me . Then you did hear my answer . You 're lucky . God , you are funny . I 'm not upset . This matter is too serious . What 're we going to do ? I want to know why this area was a target . They must have had a reason to risk this intense radiation . - It can lead to natural disasters . - But you told them about that . Yes , I gave them a scientific lecture about the irresponsibility of their doing . And how do you think they reacted ? With disciplinary proceedings against me . Impossible . Are they out of their mind ? In the last three days where are the legal instructions from the European Space Authority . I looked at it , it 's useless . We are being replaced tomorrow , by the way . Excuse me ? Say it again . I can 't understand why you want me to feel any guilt . One of us should quit their job , you 're right . I 'm just surprised that you made this decision without me . We should have talked about it . Do you know how frustrating it 'll be to wait for me , months and months . Well , we 'd have some weeks between assignments . But I don 't think this will change things for the better . This won 't solve the other problems . You know , Max , we 've just grown apart over the years . I know it sounds tough , but maybe we should separate . I don 't get it . What don 't you get ? Why the hurry ? They want to get rid of me , as fast as possible . But why ? I don 't know either . I would be happy if I did . Maybe they plan another radiation . Why would I have to watch you , if they didn 't ? How did Max find out about the American plans ? I don 't know . I went to bed early that night . I think he had a home service . I fell asleep quickly , because I was in a bad mood . And Max ? He must have found out about something . I don 't know what . He didn 't talk to you about it ? Yes , he woke me up and asked me something mumbling about the CORA initial code I used and how important it was to him . He probably wanted access to some data . Did he want the identity code ? The rest he could only assume . Or did you give him the code ? Max wasn 't dumb . He could put two and two together . It was a puzzle . Once you have all the pieces you get the picture . No , it was just a matter of time till Max figured out the game . It is 3 o 'clock , Friday , November 11th and now the latest news . Saudi-Arabia : Last night the American Air Force attempted to free fellow citizens trapped in Riyadh . These reports however are not confirmed . Occupied Riyadh reported a massive formation of helicopters flying by . The U.S. however denies these reports . International satellite authorities state no movement of the U.S. Air Force in the Middle East or the Indian Ocean . The U.S. fears a hostage situation . An increased presence of Soviet and U.S. Navy appeared in the Persian Gulf . Washington and Moscow warn about interfering in Saudi-Arabian affairs . Billy . Billy . Come on , wake up , Billy . Why do you wake me up ? Listen to me ! How did you access the data during the radiation ? Did you use a new code ? Billy ! Did Felix give you a new code ? Laurin , or something . It will be clearly visible . The black stain on the right side of the picture . It will be clearly visible . The black stain on the right side of the picture . What is it ? A recording of an infra-red night satellite . Understand . It records the reflection of the intense heat , but doesn 't see beyond . Exactly , it 's like camouflage . What do you think the guys from reconnaissance told me ? - I can imagine . - And then the Laurin effect ... What does the base think of this phenomenon ? Nighttime test radiations need a special permit now . Monitor shows target area . Okay , starting radiation . Activate Sector " B " . Target coordinates reached in 17 minutes and 20 seconds . Reactor Segment-1 activated . Automatic controls engaged . Five , four , three , two , one ... Extend radiators . Radiator Pair-1 opening . Three , two , one ... Florida Arklab , Hayes . Billy , listen . They 've started another radiation over the American Sector . All manual controls are blocked . - That cannot be . - Try and stop it , you understand ? Stop the countdown ! Target coordinates reached in 3 minutes 40 seconds . Countdown running ... prepare . Everything 's blocked here , too . - I 'm trying to deactivate the reactor . - Hurry , you don 't have much time ! Why not stop the reactor ? I 'm trying , but all manual controls are blocked . Get off me , Max , we 'll make it ! - Reactor Segment-4 active . - Reactor Segment-5 being activated . Good grief , he wants to enter the reactor ! Shit . Shit ! - Max ? - This is Felix , can you hear me ? Oh , God , not that one ... what is it ? I 'm ordering Max to return immediately ! What you 're doing up there is sabotage ! Max is at the reactor . - Billy , talk to him ! - Him listening to me ? - You 've got to be kidding ! - We 're starting the radiation code run . If Max takes out the control tapes the entire station may go ! Would you be quiet ? Max , do you hear ? There 's not enough time , we 're in the countdown . The controls will bring the fuel rods to full performance . Billy , this is insane ! Try to stop him ! Shit ! Please , Max , don 't do this ! You 'll kill us ! There will be a meltdown , man ! If you won 't listen , at least hurry , so this joint won 't blow up ! I have the 4th Segment . We have 15 seconds left ... You will make it ! Let 's go , man ! He has problems with the 5th Segment . Billy , did you hear ? Shit ! He won 't make it ! He can 't get the tape out ! Tell me what to do ! The manual controls are no longer blocked . Max , did you hear ? Yes . You have to ... Max ... Max ! Billy , try to close the radiator to interrupt the energy flow . I can 't retract the radiators with those crazy temperatures ! Billy , do what Max told you ! Oh , now all of a sudden ! This shit will blow up for sure ! Max ! Max ! Retract the radiators ! Max ! Max ! Billy ! The high-pressure valve of the cooling system opened up . Everything alright ? Only my hand is slightly hurt . I 'm coming down . Believe me , I was completely exhausted . We made it by a razor 's edge . Max got lucky . It would have been his end , if it wasn 't for the safety valve . First , I only thought about the station . The thing hissed and sparked at every turn . Then I realized the consequences of our so-called sabotage . I still didn 't know exactly what went on . - Yes . - In what condition is the station ? As good as new . I want a detailed damage report , am I clear ? Over . Can you get down by yourself ? It 's only my hand . I 'll take care of it . That doesn 't look too good . Let me see if I find bandages . - Don 't move . - They use a radiation side-effect to deceive international satellite authorities . They 're trying to get their fellow citizens out of Riyadh unnoticed . They don 't seem to care about exposing the same area over and over . - You can imagine what that means . - This is crazy , man . They 're messing up an entire climate zone . Especially the Indian monsoon winds . Hold still . But no more . The control tape is jammed . If they try to activate the reactor the whole station will blow up . - This is Felix Kronenberg . - Billy Hayes . - I want to talk to Max . - One moment . Max , telephone ! I have an announcement from the project base . Let 's hear it . You 've been discharged effective immediately . And ? Am I supposed to walk home ? This is not the time for jokes . Eva Thompson and Gregor Vandenberg will replace you in a few hours . Eva ? Yes , Max , Eva . Billy , did you listen ? - No . - Alright then , over . Imagine the position Max put me in . There 're always two sides to a story . For the Americans , it was a legitimate move . Freeing the hostages would prevent the crises from growing . To cover up the operation , they needed those two radiations . If Max hadn 't interfered , everything would 've been fine . It was a matter of hours to free the hostages . What if things went wrong ? Which things ? Why didn 't you tell Max from the start ? The Europeans didn 't even know yet . I only found out after it was decided . You couldn 't talk to Max anymore ... I tried ... I wanted to help him . But you up there didn 't listen - to the contrary . You even proclaimed not wanting to be involved in the affair at all . Did you know whose orders Vandenberg followed ? Did you have any idea who was replacing us ? What happened ? First correction . Distance 7 43 . Automatic docking system in operation . Okay , we 'll take over . Approaching coordinates : bravo , alpha , one , zero ... on the axis . Rotational difference - 145 . Synchronization started . Hayes to Maryland crew : I 've activated the docking-gate . The automatic docking system of Florida Arklab is in operation . I repeat , automatic docking system in operation . Secondary docking system active . Connecting in 25 seconds . Docking end phase . Ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five four , three , two , one , zero . Gregor , would you keep Billy busy for a while , and join us later ? Yes , I will . Max ? Hello , Billy , where is Max ? - Downstairs . - Is he hurt ? He 's okay . Billy 's down here ! Well , Max will be happy . Damn it ! Well done , Billy ! Hello Max . Let 's talk about it . This decision didn 't come easy for me . You made your decision , what are you doing here ? I want to help you . Eva , I don 't want you to be dragged into this thing . They know about us down there . Don 't let them use you . What are you talking about ? They play us against each other . I don 't want any difficulties for you . I caused you some problems too , didn 't I ? I 'm sorry . Maybe we should solve our problems together . Well ... I can 't believe this ... shit ! Japanese crap ! - I hope we 're not disturbing . - Welcome to Florida Arklab . - Quite a mess you have here . - Don 't say ! What 's with Marek ? - Why does that interest you ? - Why wouldn 't it ? You 're supposed to continue the initial radiation , right ? Am I right ? - We just follow orders . - You must be tired of living ... - Eva talks to Marek . - Good for her . Let 's hope she brings him to his senses . He , too , was part of the first radiation . And once he learns about the consequences of his refusal he 'll give in as well . What consequences ? Eva didn 't tell you ? What are the damned consequences ? The consequences . My work is subject to suspicion . The U.S. used scientific research as a weapon . I believed in the positive aspects of climate control . Eva , what happened to our guiding principles that started our research ? The documents will be on the freight elevator . Of course I 'm aware of the consequences . Yet , you will do it . Yes , even if it 'll cause a political crisis . I want to inform the population about the danger and misuse . We have calculated all data for the new radiation . Reaching target in 7 minutes . I understand , but you 're acting like the only one afraid of misuse . There are other people . Trust them . You rely on their help . Billy , tell him he can 't make a report in this political situation . If this goes public , the Americans will do anything . - Max , should I tape it ? - This is our only chance ! You really think they 'd let some scientist ruin their image by informing the public ? No way . Last night a U.S. Navy helicopter unit tried to infringe upon Saudi-Arabia . At a special U. N. session , the U.S. spokesperson denied any involvement . Standing by , our correspondent in Washington . Shortly after the announcement , peace activists gathered at the White House . - Gregor said , you knew about it . - Excuse me ? He was hinting at it . If reports of U.S. Forces are confirmed a Soviet intervention in Saudi-Arabia is to be expected . Let 's try it . Transmitting altered control data for reactor activation . Only Segment-5 is available . Gregor , what are you doing ? What kind of documents are these ? Give me that ! Don 't touch that ! Get down ! Down ! Transmit via the American base . All U.S. capacities are at the European center . Tell us when to transmit . Copy . You 're ready for transmission in 4 minutes . We got them ! Max , get ready . We 'll start . Entertaining ? - Do they record ? - Yes , of course . I 'm ready . - You don 't want to stop it ? - No , go ahead . Why the sudden change ? Vandenberg , what is going on ? Cut off the connection to the European headquarters . Use force if you have to . - Have you lost your mind ? - Vandenberg , this is an order ! Don 't forget , the success of this operation is your last chance . - You can 't ask me to do this . - Yes , we can ! You failed once before ! I don 't have to remind you of the fatal consequences . Vandenberg , cut off the connection to the European headquarters ! What 's going on down there ? You 'll reach the TV reception area in 2 minutes , are you ready ? Yes , we are . 50 seconds to go . What 's going on ? They cut the juice ! Billy , stay here ! Billy ! I 'll be right down ! Unbelievable ... everything baked , everything baked ! - Hello ! - What happened ? Nothing , the line went dead ! - Who is this Vandenberg ? - He wants to use the radiators . We have to get Billy down ! He 's in danger . Vandenberg is armed - he has a gun ! - Why didn 't you tell me before ? - I wanted you to be on the air . Base to Vandenberg . Activate reactor in 2 minutes . Did you copy ? Activate the reactor ! Mr. Vandenberg ! Come in and confirm order ! - Max , they started the countdown ! - They 'll blow us to bits ! I 'm trying to block him . It worked . The countdown stopped ! Vandenberg , why did you stop the countdown ? Marek here , we stopped the countdown . We won 't allow any further radiations . Vandenberg 's in command of Florida Arklab now and will use force if necessary . Vandenberg , come in ! Vandenberg 's not available at the moment . Turn it on ! Control tape for Segment-5 is defective . Using it will jeopardize the station . Turn it on ! Turn it on , I said ! Can 't do . Nothing is preventing the reactor activation . Activate the reactor ! I said , turn it on ! - We can 't do that ! - Get down ! Billy ! Eva , bandages , quick ! - What happened ? - He shot ! - She 's in on it . - You 're crazy ! I told that asshole , he can 't do it . Be a big boy . - Okay ? - Yes . Vandenberg , try to close the floodgate of the docking area . Use force if you have to . Did you copy ? Close the floodgate and start radiation countdown . The floodgate is defective . I repeat : floodgate is defective ! Vandenberg to Base . I 'm restarting the countdown . I 'm opening the radiators . Project base here , hurry up ... - I didn 't know about their plan . - It doesn 't matter . You 're crazy ! The cooling system will fail and we 'll have a meltdown ! - Damned idiot ! - Calm down . Starting initial radiation in 20 seconds . What 's going on , Vandenberg ? Vandenberg , come in . What 's going on up there ? I know you have a gun , Vandenberg . Let 's talk about this . There 's nothing to talk about . Get lost , Marek ! I 'll shoot ! Vandenberg , you don 't know what you 're doing . ... five , four , three ... Marek , get lost or I 'll shoot you ! Damn it , go away , I will shoot you , Marek ! We 'll give you a shot . Overheating slightly was to be expected . Please stay calm . We 've got everything under control . Everything 's according to plan . Give me that . Reactor functions are within calculated tolerance . We 'll keep the system on automatic control . You don 't have to worry . Eva , the gate is locked , we 're trapped . There 's no other way out ? ls he doing better ? We have to do something . I could try getting to the botanical area through the lower maintenance shaft . From there , it would be easy getting to the control room . You have to try to stop Gregor from leaving with the Shuttle ! I wouldn 't be surprised . Let 's see what the computer says . - Yes , that should work . - Hurry up ! Billy will get us out of here . Billy , you have to ... the reactor ... I ... I 'll do it , Max , I promise . Temperatures are still within tolerance levels . Proceed with radiations . Attention . Proceed with radiations . Vandenberg , can you hear me ? We will proceed with radiations . Radiations will continue until critical point . Leave the station immediately and inform the rest of the crew . You tricked me . Calm down . Temperatures are consistent with simulation data . You have enough time to leave on the Shuttle . Radiation will continue . Inform the crew . - I need to get upstairs ... - Vandenberg , do you copy ? - I have to get out ! - Don 't use the main shaft ! Eva ... I didn 't want this ... I didn 't want you to be part of this . Believe me . Don 't speak , Max . Have I ever told you that I love you ? You didn 't , but I always knew . Maximum safety level will be reached in 4 minutes . - Did you copy ? - Copy . In maximum 4 minutes . Eva . Eva . Eva ! Where 's Max ? Max is dead . He 's dead . Max is dead ! We have to get out of here ! Just go ! Go upstairs , go ! - The station can 't be saved . - Any signs from the crew ? - No , nothing . - Max ! Attention , three minutes till reactor meltdown . Damn it , where 's Eva ? Billy ! Billy ! Approximately one minute till reactor meltdown . It 's happening any second . No further reception of data . Critical stage has been reached . Reactor meltdown any second now . We are getting weak signals from the station system . The board system should have been shut down by now . The signal is getting weaker , I repeat , the signal is getting weaker . This is the Maryland Shuttle , Hayes speaking ... Can you hear me ? This is Hayes on the Maryland Shuttle . What will happen next ? The case is more complicated than you think . Come on , tell me what happened . The microwave radiators were used until the end . Once the Americans knew their effect , it was too late . The Indian monsoon started too early . The flood is indescribable . You and Eva are not the only ones that know . They 're investigating . What we did today was only part of it . But I think it 's a good sign that we were able to see each other . Whatever they intend to do next , I couldn 't tell you . You expect me to believe that ? No . You 're too involved . You think so ? Noah , you left your children . Let go ! Good Evening . We start with the latest reports of today . In Saudi-Arabia , rebel troops succeeded in occupying the capital of Riyadh . So far they 've taken over the Royal Palace and the radio station . The U.S. - European Space Authority reports a serious reactor accident on Florida Arklab . The Space Station was completely destroyed . Two crew members lost their lives and two were able to leave on the Shuttle . Here we can see the Space Shuttle shortly after landing . The two astronauts were immediately transferred to a hospital . Unfortunately they did succumb to heavy radiation exposure and died this afternoon . The cause of the accident is not clear and will be further investigated .

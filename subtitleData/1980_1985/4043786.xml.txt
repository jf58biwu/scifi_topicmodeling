That 's mine , but I didn 't order fries . - Mine 's the chilli beef deluxe . - Who gets the burly-beef ? - We 're ready to order now . - Yes , ma 'am . I 'm so sorry . This isn 't real leather , is it ? Nice going , kid . I ought to give you the tip . Look at it this way . In 100 years , who 's gonna care ? The 12-gauge auto-loader . That 's Italian . You can go pump or auto . The 45 long slide with laser sighting . These are new . We just got them in . That 's a good gun . The beam comes on - you put the red dot where you want the bullet to go . You can 't miss . - Anything else ? - Plasma rifle in the 40-watt range . Hey , just what you see , pal . The Uzi nine millimetre . You know your weapons , buddy . Any one of these is ideal for home defence . So which will it be ? - All . - I may close early today . It 's a 15-day wait on the handguns , but the rifles you can take now . - You can 't do that . - Wrong . Hi , baby . Yeah , yeah , it 's me . Listen , I need you to come pick me up . My bike just broke down . I don 't care what you 're doing . Come and get me . What the ... ? Hey , man , you got a serious attitude problem . - Sarah Connor ? - Yes ? I 'm on my break , Chuck . Carla 's got my station . Sarah , come here . It 's about you . I mean , sort of . Incredible . You 're not gonna believe this . You 're going to love this . Once again , Sarah Connor , 35 , mother of two brutally shot to death this afternoon . You 're dead , honey . ... if you 're into sound for the greatest sound around , come to Bob 's Stereo at 2500 Sepulveda . We 've got woofers , tweeters , the newest in audio and compact discs . We 've got graphic equalisers and sound balancers that ... Sorry . Hello ? First I 'm gonna rip the buttons off your blouse one by one then run my tongue down your neck to your bare , gleaming breasts . And then slowly ... slowly pull yourjeans offinch by inch . Ginger , it 's Matt . And lick your belly in circles further and further down and then pull your panties off with my teeth . Who is this ? God . Sarah ? Jesus . I 'm sorry . I thought you were ... Can I talk to Ginger ? Sure . It 's the creep . Hello ? First I 'll rip the buttons off your blouse one by one ... You fucking pigs . Wait till I get my hands on you . Get off me . Ed . - What have you got ? - Dead girl . - I can see that . - Sarah Ann Connor , secretary , 35 . Shot six times at less than 10 feet . Large calibre weapon . You know , these work . - What 's this ? - Dead girl two . Sent over from the Valley division this afternoon . Are you sure there 's a point to all of this ? Look at the name , Ed . Sarah Louise Connor . Is this right ? You 're kidding . The press is gonna be short-stroking it . - A one-day pattern killer . - I hate the weird ones . So ... Better than mortal man deserves . - Ginger , have you seen Pugsley ? - Not lately . Did you check messages ? I thought you did . - Hi , Sarah , this is your mom ... - There you are , young man . You mind your mother . Hi , Sarah . Stan Morsky . Something 's come up . Looks like I won 't be able to make it tonight . Just can 't get out of it . I 'm really sorry . I 'll make it up to you . Call you in a day or so . Bye . That bum . So what if he has a Porsche ? He can 't treat you like this . It 's Friday night , for Christ 's sake . I 'll live . I 'll break his kneecaps . Well , Pugsley still loves me . Don 't you , baby ? God . It 's disgusting . I 'm gonna go to a movie , kiddo . Have a good time . - We will . You , too . - OK . Damn it , Matt . Shit . These killings occurred in the order of their listings in the phone book . - What can I tell you ? No comment . - But , Lieutenant ... That coffee 's two hours cold . I put a cigarette out in it . - Did you reach the next girl yet ? - No . I got her answering machine . - Send a unit . - I sent a unit . There 's no answer . - The apartment manager 's not in . - Call her . - I just called her . - Call her again . Give me a cigarette . Hi , there . Fooled you . You 're talking to a machine . But don 't be shy . It 's OK . Machines need love , too , so talk to it ... Same shit . I can hear it now . He 's gonna be called the goddamn Phone Book Killer . I hate these press cases . Especially the weird press cases . - Where are you going ? - To make a statement . Maybe make these jackals work for us . If I can get on the tube by eleven o 'clock , maybe she 'll call us . Well , how do I look ? - Like shit , boss . - Your mama . This just in . Police have announced the name of the victim in the second of two murders which took place today . Incredibly , the names of the two victims are virtually identical . Two hours ago , 35-year-old Sarah Ann Connor was pronounced dead ... - Can we change this ? - Sarah Louise ... Don 't touch it . Police are refusing to speculate on the similarity between the shooting deaths and no other connection between the two victims has been established yet . We 'll have more on this late-breaking story as it comes in . - Hey , you got a phone ? - It 's in the back . Hey . Four-fifty . You have reached the Los Angeles Police Department emergency number . All lines are busy . If you need a police car sent out to you , stay on the line . Go on . I 'm gonna make a belt out of you . Don 't make me bust you up , man . Hi , there . Fooled you . You 're talking to a machine . But don 't be shy . It 's OK . Machines need love , too . So talk to it and Ginger , that 's me , or Sarah will get back to you . Wait for the beep . This is Sarah . Pick up ifyou 're there . I 'm at this place on Pico Boulevard called Tech Noir . I 'm really scared . I think that there 's somebody after me . I hope that you play this back soon . I need you and Matt to come and pick me up as soon as possible . The police keep transferring me . I 'm gonna give ' em another try . The number here is 555 9175 . Call me , kiddo . I need your help . It 's her . Sarah Connor ? It 's Lieutenant Traxler . Look , Lieutenant , don 't put me on hold . Don 't transfer me to another department . Don 't worry , I won 't , just relax . Can you tell me where you are ? - I 'm in this bar called Tech Noir . - I know it . It 's on Pico . - Are you all right ? - Yeah , but I don 't wanna leave . - I think there 's a guy following me . - All right now , listen , Miss Connor . Now , listen carefully . You 're in a public place , so you 'll be safe ' till we get there . But stay visible . Don 't go outside . - I 'll have a car there in a minute . - OK . - Let 's see how this guy likes playing hardball . - Fasten your seatbelt , man . Hey , that guy didn 't pay . Come with me if you wanna live . Come on ! This is one-L-19 . I got a hit-and-run felony . Suspect vehicle , late model grey Ford headed westbound on Seven . He 's really moving , punching lights all the way . I 'm gonna need an ambulance at Seventh and Broadway right now . Hey , hold it ! Hold on . Are you injured ? Are you shot ? Do exactly what I say . Exactly . Don 't move unless I say . Don 't make a sound unless I say . Do you understand ? - Do you understand ? - Yes . Please don 't hurt me . I 'm here to help you . I 'm Reese . Sergeant Tech-Com . DN38416 . Assigned to protect you . You 've been targeted for termination . Go . Go . He 's got her . This is one-L-19 . Westbound on Olympic . Approaching Overland . This is a mistake . I didn 't do anything . No , but you will . It 's very important that you live . This isn 't true . How could that man just get up after you ... It 's not a man . A machine . A Terminator . Cyberdyne Systems model 101 . A machine ? Like a robot ? Not a robot . A cyborg . Cybernetic organism . - No . He was bleeding . - Just a second . Get your head down . All right , listen . The Terminator 's an infiltration unit . Part man , part machine . Underneath it 's a hyper-alloy combat chassis . Microprocessor controlled . Fully armoured , very tough . But outside , it 's living human tissue . Flesh , skin , hair , blood ... grown for the cyborgs . - Look , Reese , I don 't know ... - Pay attention . I gotta ditch this car . The 600-Series had rubber skin . We spotted them easy . But these are new . They look human . Sweat , bad breath , everything . Very hard to spot . I had to wait till he moved on you before I could zero him . Look , I am not stupid , you know ? They cannot make things like that yet . Not yet . Not for about forty years . Are you saying it 's from the future ? One possible future ... from your point of view . I don 't know tech stuff . Then you 're from the future , too . Is that right ? - Right . - Right . Cyborgs don 't feel pain . I do . Don 't do that again . - Just let me go . - Listen and understand . That Terminator is out there . It can 't be bargained with , it can 't be reasoned with . It doesn 't feel pity or remorse or fear and it absolutely will not stop , ever , until you are dead . Can you stop it ? I don 't know . With these weapons , I don 't know . All units . Ford suspect vehicle has been found in a parking structure ... Reese , why me ? Why does it want me ? There was a nuclear war . A few years from now all this , this whole place , everything it 's gone , just gone . There were survivors . Here , there . Nobody even knew who started it . - It was the machines , Sarah . - I don 't understand . Defence network computers . New , powerful hooked into everything , trusted to run it all . They say it got smart ... a new order of intelligence . Then it saw all people as a threat . Not just the ones on the other side . It decided our fate in a microsecond . Extermination . Did you see this war ? No . I grew up after . In the ruins . Starving . Hiding from the H-Ks . - H-Ks ? - Hunter-killers . Patrol machines built in automated factories . Most of us were rounded up . Put in camps for orderly disposal . This was burned in by laser scanner . Some of us were kept alive . To work . Loading bodies . The disposal units ran night and day . We were that close to going out for ever . But there was one man who taught us to fight . To storm the wire of the camps . To smash those metal motherfuckers into junk . He turned it around . He brought us back from the brink . His name was Connor . John Connor . Your son , Sarah . Your unborn son . Drive . Reese ! No , Reese . No , no , no . They 'll kill you . You in the Cadillac , let me see your hands now . Get out of the car . Drop to your knees . - Out of the car . - Drop to the ground . Sarah . Sarah , try to drink some of this . Listen , are you sure it 's them ? I mean , maybe I should look at the bodies . No . They 've been identified and there 's no doubt . Ginger . Kiddo . - Sarah , this is Dr Silberman . - Hi , Sarah . Tell him everything Reese told you , Sarah . Do you feel up to that ? Yeah , I guess so . - You 're a doctor ? - Criminal psychologist . - Is Reese crazy ? - That 's what we 're gonna find out . So you 're a soldier . Fighting for whom ? With the 132nd under Perry . From ' 21 to ' 27 . That 's the year 2027 ? That 's right . Then I was assigned ... - This is fucking great . - ... under John Connor . - Who was the enemy ? - A computer defence system ... Goddamn ! Sorry . ... built for SAC-NORAD by Cyberdyne Systems . I see . And this computer thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy . Killing him , in effect , before he 's even conceived . A sort of retroactive abortion ? Silberman cracks me up . Last week , a guy burned his Afghan . - He screwed it first ... - Ed , shut up . Why didn 't the computer just kill Connor then ? Why this elaborate scheme with the Terminator ? It had no choice . Their defence grid was smashed . We 'd won . Taking out Connor then would make no difference . Skynet had to wipe out his entire existence . Is that when you captured the lab complex and found ... What is it called ? The time displacement equipment ? That 's right . The Terminator had already gone through . Connor sent me to intercept and they blew the whole place . Well , how are you supposed to get back ? I can 't . Nobody goes home . Nobody else comes through . It 's just him and me . Come on , Ed . That was moon talk . The guy 's a wacko , right ? He 's better be . It 's just him and me . Why didn 't you bring any weapons ? Something more advanced . Don 't you have ray guns ? - Ray guns . - Show me a piece of future technology . You go naked . Something about the field generated by a living organism . Nothing dead will go . I didn 't build the fucking thing . OK , OK . But this cyborg , if it 's metal ... - Surrounded by living tissue . - Oh , right . Great stuff . I could make a career out of this guy . See how clever it is ? It doesn 't require a shred of proof . Most paranoid delusions are intricate , but this is brilliant . - Why were the other women killed ? - Records were lost in the war . Skynet knew almost nothing about Connor 's mother . Her full name , where she lived . Theyjust knew the city . The Terminator was just being systematic . - Let 's go back ... - Look , you have heard enough . I have answered your questions . I have to see Sarah Connor . - I 'm afraid that 's not up to me . - Then why am I talking to you ? - Who is in authority here ? - Please ... Shut up ! You still don 't get it , do you ? He 'll find her . That 's what he does . That 's all he does . You can 't stop him . He 'll reach down her throat and pull her fucking heart out ! - Doc . - Let go of me ! Sorry . He 's crazy ? In technical terminology , he 's a loon . Sarah , this is what they call body armour . Our TAC guys wear these . It 'll stop a 12-gauge round . This other man must 've been wearing one under his coat . Feel that . - He punched through the windshield . - He was probably on PCP . Broke every bone in his hand . He wouldn 't feel it . There was this guy once ... You see this scar ? Thank you . There 's a couch in this other room . Stretch out and get some sleep . Be at least an hour before your mother gets here . - I can 't sleep . - Try . Well , it may not look it , but that couch is very comfortable . You 'll be perfectly safe . We got 30 cops in this building . Thank you . - Good night . - Good night . I 'm a friend of Sarah Connor . I was told that she 's here . Could I see her please ? No . Can 't see her . She 's making a statement . Where is she ? Look , it may take a while . If you wanna wait , there 's a bench over there . I 'll be back . Stay here . Watch him . Ed ... Sarah ! Reese . This way . Reese ! She 's got to save our lives . Do whatever you have to . Do . KFLB news time . 4.36 . Top story - the largest single law enforcement mobilisation in California history is currently underway . Police in five counties are engaged in a massive manhunt for ... Take this . All right . Let 's get this off the road . - You cold ? - Freezing . Reese ? - You got a first name ? - Kyle . Kyle , what 's it like when you go through time ? White light . Pain . - It 's like being born maybe . - My God . I caught one back there . - You mean you got shot ? - It 's not bad . - We gotta get you to a doctor . - It 's OK . Forget it . What do you mean , forget it ? Are you crazy ? Take this off . Jesus . See ? It passed right through the meat . This is gonna make me puke . - Would you just talk about something ? - What ? I don 't know . Anything . Just talk . Tell me about my son . He 's about my height . He has your eyes . What 's he like ? You trust him . He 's got a strength . I 'd die for John Connor . Well , at least now I know what to name him . Don 't suppose you know who the father is so I won 't tell him to get lost ? John never said much about him . - I know he dies before the war ... - Wait . I don 't wanna know . So was it John that sent you here ? I volunteered . - Why ? - It was a chance to meet the legend . Sarah Connor , who taught her son to fight , organise , prepare from when he was a kid . When you were in hiding before the war . You 're talking about things I haven 't done yet in the past tense . It 's driving me crazy . Are you sure you have the right person ? I 'm sure . Come on ! Do I look like the mother of the future ? I mean , am I tough ? Organised ? I can 't even balance my chequebook . Look , Reese , I didn 't ask for this honour and I don 't want it . Any of it . Your son gave me a message to give to you . Made me memorise it . Thank you , Sarah , for your courage through the dark years . I can 't help you with what you must soon face , except to say that the future is not set . You must be stronger than you imagine you can be . You must survive or I will never exist . That 's all . It 's a good field dressing . You like it ? It 's my first . Get some sleep . It 'll be light soon . OK . Talk to me some more . About what ? Tell me about where you 're from . All right . You stay down by day , but at night you can move around . You still have to be careful because the H-Ks use infrared . But they 're not too bright . John taught us ways to dust them . That 's when the infiltrators started to appear . The Terminators were the newest . The worst . Traversing your sector in search mode . 750 metres north of your position . Let 's go . - Reese . DN384 ... - Right . Let him in . Terminator ! Terminator ! I was dreaming about dogs . We use ' em to spot Terminators . Your world is pretty terrifying . Hey , buddy , you got a dead cat in there or what ? Fuck you , asshole . I know , Mom , this is a sorry second ... uh ... I know . Mom ! Mom , I can 't talk on now . No , I am okay . I 'm just not supposed to be talking to anybody . Okay , I want you to listen . I want you to grab a few things and I want you to go to cabin for a few days . No , don 't tell anybody where you 're going . I don 't want you to ask questions , I just want you to do it . Okay , I can 't talk right now , I 'll talk to you later if I can , okay ? Okay , I gotta go . Bye . All right , all right , all right . Come on , we gotta get a car . No , put away the gun . I can get us a ride . You can 't . Look what I found . What 's that ? Cyberdyne Systems , isn 't that it ? What about it ? Listen to this : .. They 'll develop this revolutionary thing . This ... uh ... - Collective memory . - Right . So they 'll become high tech computerized and they 'll get the values to the government . Right ? Right , yeah , that 's the way it was told to me . So we can eighty-six the bastards . We can blow it up , it 'll never happen . Now it 's tactically dangerous . We 'll lay low . No , Reese . We 'll get through . We can prevent the war . There 's nobody else . If we go to somebody official , we end up in jail again , and he 's got us again . We 've got to do it ourselves . It 's not my mission . Listen . Understand , I 'm not a military objective , I 'm a person , and you don 't own me . - Sarah ... - Fuck you . Let me go . Sarah ! Sarah ! - Sarah ! - No ! No ! - Let go ! - Sarah ! Okay , do it , go ahead , shoot ! That 's nice . Jesus ... Christ ! Reese , don 't you see that I am scared ? I don 't want to spend my whole life waiting for that thing to catch up to me . Always looking over my shoulder , wondering if I left some tiny clue behind . Reese ! Reese . I don 't belong here . I wasn 't meant to see this . It 's like a dream . This and this and you . So beautiful . It hurts , Sarah . It hurts so bad . You can 't understand . It 's gone . All gone . All of it it 's gone . Well , we can change it , Kyle . We have to at least try . There 's no fate but what we make for ourselves . All right ? Come on , kiddo . What do you say ? Okay . God damn . Thank you . Is this enough ? Yeah , it 's enough . I don 't wanna ask where you got it . - I 'm coming . - We need a room . All right . - With a kitchen . - Do you have one with a kitchen ? I am dying for a shower . We should check your bandage , too . Later . I 'm going out for supplies . Keep this . No , I can 't tell you where I am , Mom . I was told not to say . I need to know where to reach you . You tell me to hide out at the cabin and you won 't tell me what 's going on ? I am worried sick here . OK . OK , here 's the number . - You ready ? - Yes . Go ahead . It 's 408 555 1439 . Room nine . - Got it ? - I 've got it . I gotta go . I 'm sorry I can 't tell you more right now . I love you , Mom . I love you , too , sweetheart . - Tiki Motel . - Give me your address there . What have we got ? Mothballs ... corn syrup ... ammonia . What 's for dinner ? - Plastique . - That sounds good . What is it ? It 's a nitroglycerin base . It 's a bit more stable . I learned to make it when I was a kid . Make sure there 's none on the threads . Like this . Screw the end cap on . Very gently . You must 've had a fun childhood . That 's good . All right . Six more like that and I 'll get started on the fuses . You know , I was thinking . There 're so many things to do once we get through this . Possibilities are amazing . And there 's ... Disneyland beach ... movies matinees with popcorn and foot long hot dogs . Hot dogs ? Hot dogs . All these things you 've never seen and done . Well , you 're here , but you 're not really here . Wherever you go , you bring a war with you . My life has been a war . I want it to be over for you . That doesn 't seem possible . I want it to be over for me , too . I feel like I 've crossed some invisible line like I 'm in your world now . It 's like there 's you , and me , and him . Nobody can help us . Not even understand . We had another 200 . It gives you four hours to sleep if you want . Finished up here . He 'll find us , won 't he ? Probably . It 'll never be over , will it ? Look at me . I 'm shaking . Some legend . You must be pretty disappointed . No , I 'm not . Kyle , the women in your time , what are they like ? Good fighters . That 's not what I meant . Was there someone special ? Someone ... ? A girl , you know . No . Never . Never ? I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . So much pain . Pain can be controlled . You just disconnect it . So you feel nothing ? John Connor gave me a picture of you once . I didn 't know why at the time . It was very old , torn , faded . You were young like you are now . You seemed just a little sad . I used to always wonder what you were thinking at that moment . I memorised every line , every curve . I came across time for you , Sarah . I love you . I always have . I shouldn 't have said that . What are you doing ? Go tickling . Maybe you want a second you 'll beg for mercy . I think I like this very much . Really ? Nice to buzz you . Think fast . Trade places . Faster . Drive faster . Kyle . Oh , my God . Kyle . You stay here . Let 's get outta here . Get out . Kyle . Come on . Get up . Coming . Come on . Help me . Get out . Get out . Don 't stop . Run . Sarah . Kyle . Kyle . Kyle . We did it , Kyle . We got him . No . No . Wait . What are you doing ? Cover , so he can 't track us . Kyle . Come on . No . Kyle . Come on . - Kyle . - Leave me here . Move it , Reese . On your feet , soldier . On your feet . Move it . Get back . Go back . - Run , Sarah . - No . Run . Run . Come on , motherfucker . No . No . You 're terminated , fucker . Kyle . Hey , look , I told you I don 't want you to touch anything until we 're done . You got that ? Yeah , officer . What 's that ? Microcomputer chasis . But I never saw stuff like that anywhere . Weird . Best stuff made . Get us an inquiry first thing Monday morning , huh ? Good idea . Tape seven , November 10 . Where was I ? What 's most difficult for me is trying to decide what to tell you and what not to . But I guess I have a while yet before you 're old enough to even understand these tapes . They 're more for me at this point just so that I can get it straight . Should I tell you about your father ? Boy , that 's a tough one . Will it effect your decision to send him here , knowing that he is your father ? If you don 't send Kyle , you can never be . God , a person could go crazy thinking about this . I suppose I will tell you . I owe him that . Maybe it 'll help if ... you know that in the few hours that we had together , we loved a lifetime 's worth . - What did he just say ? - He says you 're very beautiful , signora . He is ashamed to ask you for five American dollars for this picture . But if he doesn 't , his father will beat him . Pretty good hustle , kid . What did he just say ? He said there 's a storm coming in . I know .

 SiliconChip [ boy ] all right , give me room . Here we go . - what 's this game called ? - this is lightcycle . Damn ! [ master control program ] you 're getting brutal , sark . Brutal and needlessly sadistic . Thank you , master control . We 've kidnapped some military programs . I can arrange more lethal matches . Interested ? Sure . I 'd love to go up against one of those guys . It 'd make a nice break from those accounting cream puffs you keep sending me . What branch of the service ? Strategic air command . Nice ! Hey , look . This is all a mistake . I 'm just a compound interest program . I work at a savings and loan . I can 't play these video games . Sure you can , pal . You look like a natural athlete if I ever saw one . Who , me ? Are you kidding ? I went out to check on t-bill rates , I ran out of breath . Hey , look . You guys are gonna make my user , mr . Henderson , very angry . He 's a full branch manager . Great . Another religious nut ! I 'd say , " welcome , friend , " but not here , not like this . I don 't even know what I 'm doing here . Do you believe in the users ? Yeah , sure . If I don 't have a user , then who wrote me ? That 's what you 're doing here . Master control program 's been snapping up all us programs who believe . If he thinks you 're useful , he takes over all your functions so he gets bigger . If he can 't use you , he sends you down here to the game grid get your bits blasted . What 's your name ? Crom . I 'm ram . They 'll train you for the games , but ... [ whistles ] I hope you make it . Hey , what 's been going on in the other sectors ? I 've been stuck here for 200 microcycles . It 's murder out there . You can 't even travel around in your own microcircuits ... Without permission from master control program . I mean , sending me down here to play games . Who does he calculate he is ? [ flynn ] okay , clu , Tonight we check everything in the right-hand column . Come on . Come on . Where are you ? There you are . Clu ? Yes , sir . We don 't have much time to find that file . This is top priority . I know , sir . This isn 't correcting my bank statement ... Or phone bill problem- - this is a must . I understand . Now , I wrote you . Yes , sir . I taught you everything about the system . Thank you , but- - no buts . That 's for users . You 're the best program that 's ever been written . You 're dogged and relentless , remember ? Let me at ' em . That 's the spirit . Keep that tank rolling . I 'll try to cover you from this end . Go ! You think we can merge with this memory , bit ? Yes . Hmm . Now flynn is saying to look over in here , But I don 't see what we 're looking for . Come on , you scuzzy data , be in there . Come on . Uh-oh ! We 've got company . I don 't believe this . A recognizer . There 's too many ! What is this ? Aahh ! Damn it ! - get out of here ! - yes-yes-yes . Busted again ! God , and that was my best program . Got a pirate program here . Says his name 's clu . [ master control program ] what did he pull ? He came into the system with a stolen password . We caught him trying to raid our high-clearance memory . No ! I must 've gotten in there by mistake . - [ mcp ] who programmed you ? - I was simp- - Aah ! [ mcp ] you 're in trouble , program . Make it easy on yourself . Who 's your user ? Forget it , mr . High and mighty master control . You aren 't making me talk . Suit yourself . Aah ! [ mcp ] get me dillinger . [ helicopter whirring ] Good evening , mr . Dillinger . Thank you , peter . You can go now . Yes , sir . [ master control speaks ] No problem , master c . If you 've seen one consumer electronics show , you 've seen them all . What 's up ? Flynn ? Yes . He 's still looking for that old file . Can 't you just appropriate it ? I have . I put it in my memory , which he hasn 't located . But he might find it . I 'm afraid so . I spotted him this time and kept him out , But he 's getting trickier all the time . I think we should shut down all access ... Until we find that flynn , just to be safe . There 's a 68.71 % chance you 're right . Cute . Come on ! Hey , alan . You think I could have some of your popcorn ? Yeah , sure . - sit down . - thank you . [ clears throat ] We 've had to shut down all group-7 personnel . Just briefly . Security . Someone with that access has been tampering . I hope you don 't think it 's me . I don 't even balance my checkbook on downtime . - I have an abacus at home for that . - I 'm sure you understand . It 'll only be a couple of days . What 's the project you 're working on ? It 's called tron . It 's a security program itself , actually . It monitors all contacts between our system and other systems . Finds anything going on that 's not scheduled , it shuts it down . I sent you a memo on it . Part of the master control program ? No , it 'll run independently and watchdog the mcp as well . Sounds good . We should have you running in a couple of days . I hope . Okay . Thanks . Oh , boy . [ mcp ] mr . Dillinger , I 'm so very disappointed in you . I 'm sorry . I can 't afford to have an independent programmer monitoring me . Do you realize how many outside systems I 've gone into ? How many programs I 've appropriated ? Come on ! A couple of days . Hi , dr . Gibbs . Well , here goes nothing . Yeah , interesting . You hear what you just said ? " here goes nothing . " well , what I meant was- - Actually , what we propose to do is to change something into nothing and back again . You might just as well have said , " here goes something , here comes nothing . " Right . Mm-hmm . [ dr . Gibbs ] this is the big moment . I know . This will narrow your theory that the scanned u-v beam ... Is superior to single pulse exposure . [ woman on p.A. ] laser activity will exist in 30 seconds . Put on your goggles . Leave the bay . [ lora ] let 's see if we 've got the green light . - is the target area shielded ? - they verified safety . Twenty seconds . Looks good . Let her rip . This is what we 've been waiting for . Ten seconds . - five seconds . - [ machines whirring ] Perfect ! [ coworkers clapping ] Beautiful ! Hi , alan . You two having fun disintegrating things ? Not disintegrating , digitizing . A laser dismantles the molecular structure of the object , And molecules remain suspended in the laser beam . Then , when the computer plays out the model , The molecules fall back into place , and voilá ! Great . Can it send me to hawaii ? Yeah , but you 've got to purchase your program 30 days in advance . How 's it going upstairs ? Frustrating . I had tron almost ready ... When dillinger cut everyone with group-7 access out of the system . Ever since he got that master control program , The system 's got more bugs than a bait store . You gotta expect some static . After all , computers are just machines . They can 't think . Some programs will be thinking soon . [ chuckles ] won 't that be grand ? Computers and programs will start thinking , and the people will stop . I 'm gonna stay around , put some data through . See you tomorrow . Bye . Come on . Did you say group-7 access ? Yeah . What a hassle . I was all set . Did he say why ? Something about tampering . Tampering ? Flynn has been thinking about breaking into the system ever since dillinger canned him . And he had group-7 access . Flynn had access to you too . [ lora ] I want to go to flynn 's place . What for ? To warn him . Of what ? That dillinger 's onto him . I don 't see why I have to do that guy any favors . I don 't know what you ever saw in that guy , anyway . I loved him for his brains . [ chuckles ] Don 't put any change in the meter . We 're gonna need it for the games . Boy ! I haven 't been here in a long time . ¶ [ music ] [ chattering ] [ girl ] hey , bobby , up here . Where is he ? I don 't know . Somewhere in here , lost in one of his games . Excuse me . Do you know where flynn is ? Yeah , he 's over there on his machine . [ boy ] he 's really on a roll ! One more reco before he ties . Another reco and he gets the world 's record . [ boy ] he 's going for the record . The all-time record coming up . This is it . It 's all over . Flynn 's gonna be a part of history , all right ! Hey , flynn , how 'd you do it ? It 's all in the wrists . 999,000 points ! Hey , good to see you guys . Nothing classes up the joint like a clean-cut young couple . We gotta talk . You can 't hear yourself think in here . Come on . Come on . I 'll be down in a minute . How 's the world of serious science ? Go up ahead . Make yourselves at home . Be right up . [ chuckles ] the best programmer encom ever saw , And he winds up playing space cowboy in some back room . Okay , let me handle this . Go right ahead . Have you been sneaking into the encom system ? You never were much for small talk , were you ? - she still leave her clothes all over the floor ? - no . - alan ! - I mean , not that often . You can see why all his friends are 14 years old . Touché . I have been doing a little hacking , as a matter of fact . - you did break in . - tried to . I can 't seem to quite get the connection with that sucker , though . If I had a direct terminal- - Flynn , are you embezzling ? [ game beeping ] Embezzling is such an ugly word , mr . Bradley . No , actually , I 'm trying to get some solid evidence together . - I don 't get it . - okay . Sherman , set the way-back machine for three years ago . Kevin flynn , One of encom 's brightest young software engineers . He 's so bright , he starts going in at night , Sets up his own private memory file ... And begins writing a program for video games , invented called ... Space paranoids . You invented space paranoids ? Paranoids , matrix blaster , vice squad- - a whole slew of ' em . I was this close to starting my own little enterprise . But enter another software engineer ; Not so young , not so bright , but very , very sneaky ; Ed dillinger . One night , our boy flynn , he goes to his terminal , tries to read up his file . I get nothing on there . There 's a big blank . All right , now we take you three months later , Dillinger presents encom with five video games ... That he 's invented . The slime didn 't even change the names , man ! He gets a big , fat promotion . Thus begins his meteoric rise to- - what is he now ? - executive v.P. ? - senior exec ? Senior exec ? Meanwhile , kids are putting eight million quarters a week into paranoid machines . I don 't see a dime , except what I squeeze outta here . I still don 't understand why you want to break into the system . Because , man , somewhere in one of these memories is the evidence . If I got in far enough I could reconstruct it . My password , dillinger 's instructions to divert the data- - It 's too late for that ! Dillinger 's cut off everybody with group-7 access . Wait . Wait . What are you saying ? The guy knows what you 're up to . Great . You 're kidding me ? Well , now there is nothing to stop him . It 's just dillinger and the mcp running things from on high now . Not if my tron program was running . That 'd shut the system down . You know , if your file was in there- - Wait a minute . If we can get in there , I can forge us a group-6 access . Well ? Shall we dance ? [ dillinger ] I shut down group-7 for a very good reason . Ed , all I 'm saying is if our people can 't get access to their programs- - Well , you know how frustrating it is when you 're working on a piece of research . I sympathize , but I have data coming from the master control program ... Telling me there 's something screwy going on . That mcp , that 's half our problem right there . The mcp is the most efficient way of handling what we do ! I can 't sit here and worry about every little user request that comes in . User requests are what computers are for . Doing our business is what computers are for ! Encom isn 't the business you started in your garage anymore . We 're building accounts in 30 different countries , new defense systems . We have one of the most sophisticated pieces of equipment in existence . Oh , I know all that . Sometimes I wish I were back in that garage . That can be arranged , walter . That was uncalled for . You can remove men like alan and me from the system , but we helped create it . And our spirit remains in every program we designed for this computer . Walter , it 's getting late . I 've got better things to do ... Than to have religious discussions with you . Don 't worry about encom anymore . It 's out of your hands now . I don 't think I 'm cleared for this . I 'm certainly not . You wanna move aside ? Give the kid a little room . This guy 's a little like santa claus . I make these myself . You want one ? [ flynn ] they never should have gotten rid of me . Now that is a big door . Shut up . It 's my fault . I programmed you to want too much . [ mcp ] I was planning to hit the pentagon next week . The pentagon ? It shouldn 't be harder than any other big company . But now this is what I get for using humans . Wait a minute . I wrote you ! I 've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then . What do you want with the pentagon ? The same thing I want with the kremlin . I 'm bored with corporations . With the information I can access , I can run things 900 to 1,200 times better than any human . If you think you 're superior to us- - You wouldn 't want me to dig up flynn 's file ... And read it up on a v.D.T. At the times , would you ? You wouldn 't dare ! Hi . Hi . Working late ? Yeah . Okay , come here . I 'm gonna put him at my terminal . I 'm gonna meet you in your office upstairs . Don 't fall asleep . If and when I activate your tron program , You 'll only have a few minutes to use it before dillinger catches the break in security . As long as we stay off the top floor , Dillinger will never know we 've been in here . [ alan ] good luck , hotshot . Ahem . Flynn ! After you . [ mcp ] keep those programers out of the system , And get me that chinese language file I asked for . End of line . You are going to stick with me ? What for ? You 're the one who never needed help , remember ? Come on . I 'm scared of the dark . All this technology scares me . This way ! When did they put this in ? This is where I work . I 've got a direct terminal in the laser target area . You can stay there all night if you have to . Like a man says , " there 's no problems , only solutions . " Okay , remember , this laser is my life 's work . Don 't spill anything . Huh ? Have fun , sweetheart . Hey , it 's the big master control program everybody 's been talking about . [ mcp ] sit right there . Make yourself comfortable . Remember the time we used to spend playing chess together ? Stop ! Please . You realize I can 't allow this ? How are you gonna run the universe if you can 't answer a few unsolvable problems ? Come on , big fella , let 's see what you 've got . [ mcp ] I 'd like to go against you and see what you 're made of . You don 't look a thing like your pictures . I 'm warning you , you 're entering a big error , flynn . I 'm gonna have to put you on the game grid . Games ? You want games ? I 'll give you games . Oh , man , this isn 't happening . It only thinks it 's happening . Vacate entry port , program . I said , move ! Aah ! Hey ! Look , if this is about those parking tickets , I can explain everything , okay ? Prepare all programs for war games . I 've got a little challenge for you , sark ; a new recruit . It 's a tough case , but but I want him treated in the usual manner . Train him for the games , Let him hope for a while , then blow him away . You got it . I 've been hoping you 'd send me somebody with a little bit of guts . What kind of program is he ? He 's not any kind of program , sark , he 's a user . A user ? That 's right . He pushed me in the real world . Somebody pushes me , I push back . So I brought him down here . What 's the matter , sark ? You look nervous . Well , I- - I was just- - I don 't know . A user , I mean- - Users wrote us . A user even wrote you ! No one user wrote me . I 'm worth millions of their man-years . What if I can 't ? You 'd rather take your chances with me ? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you ? Wait ! I need that ! Then pull yourself together . Get this clown trained . I want him in the games until he dies playing . Acknowledge . Acknowledged , master control . End of line . Video game unit 18 . In here , program . Who you calling program , program ? New guy ? Another free program off-line . You really think the users are still there ? They 'd better be . I don 't wanna bust out of here and find nothing but a lot of cold circuits waiting for me . Hey . Who are you guys ? Hold it ! You wanna watch those force fields . You 'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt . Don 't worry about that . Look , just so I can tell my friends ... What this dream is about , okay , where am I ? You 're a ... Guest of the master control program . Oh , great . They 're gonna make you play video games . No sweat . I play video games better than anybody . Move out ! This way . You , you come this way . There 's been a mistake . I 've gotta see the guy in charge . You will . [ guard yells , indistinct ] Command program sark 's carrier is approaching . He will explain the training procedures . Greetings . The master control program has chosen you ... To serve your system on the game grid . Those of you who continue to profess a belief in the users ... Will receive the standard substandard training , Which will result in your eventual elimination . Those of you who renounce ... This superstitious and hysterical belief , Will be eligible to join the warrior elite ... Of the mcp . You will each receive an identity disk . Everything you do or learn ... Will be imprinted on this disk . If you lose your disk or fail to follow commands , You will be subject to immediate de-resolution . That will be all . [ guard ] move out . Hey , who 's that guy ? That 's tron . He fights for the users . Tron ? [ flynn ] that 's pretty good . Watch this . You gotta be good if you wanna survive . What 's your name ? My name 's ram . Hey , ram , What were you , you know , before ? I was an actuarial program . I worked for a big insurance company . Really gives you a great feeling ... Helping folks plan for their future needs . Of course , if you think of the payments as an annuity over the years , The cost is really quite minimal . Yeah , that 's great . Actuarial program . Nice . How about yourself ? Oh , I don 't remember too much . Name 's flynn . Sure , a little disorientation , that 's normal in transport . It 'll come back to you . [ footsteps ] [ ram ] this is it . Good luck , flynn . Sir , conscript being moved from pit cell to ring game . You know- - hey ! You guys sure are friendly . Wait . Let him fight one of his own kind . You think you 're gonna wipe me out , don 't you ? No , I- - Hey ! I- - The new guy was asking about you . It 's too bad he 's in a match now . I 'll probably never meet him . You might . There 's something different about him . Okay . That was a very fancy shot . Okay , here 's an easy one . Finish the game ! - no ! - kill him . No . You 'll regret this . Aah ! [ mcp ] I want him in the games until he dies playing . This is the holding area for the lightcycles . - hey , flynn , you made it ! - wait here . - you won ! - alan . Where did you hear that name ? That 's your name , isn 't it ? The name of my user . How did you know ? I 'm a program from a user that knows alan . He was disoriented in transport , tron . But I 'm remembering all kinds of stuff , Like my user wants me to go after the mcp . My user wants that too . I know . [ computer voice ] prepare to transport to lightcycle grid . We have transport . Wow . Blue leader to blue bikes . Run these guys into your jet walls . Copy , blue leader . Copy , blue leader . [ tron ] this is gold-1 to gold-2 and 3 . Split up . Take them one-on-one . - watch it ! - aah ! Taking him into the maze . This is it . Come on . Gold-3 to gold-2 and 1 . I 'm getting out of here now and you guys are invited . [ ram ] got it . - ready ? - ready . - so long , sucker ! - aah ! Greetings , programs ! Video game warriors escaping game grid . This is an illegal exit . You must return to game grid . Repeat , this is an illegal exit . You must return to the grid . Gold-2 to gold-3 . Those demons are coming down . Get them ! Send out every game tank in the grid . Get them ! [ flynn ] I should never have written all those tank programs . Targets leaving protective field . Missed ! All units exiting game arena . Target units accelerating ! Pursuit force minus one tank . Close ranks . Oh , man . On the other side of the screen , It all looked so easy . They must 've gone right past us . We made it ... This far . Pursuit force reporting . We lost visual contact with escaped units . Awaiting further orders . Get the pursuit forces back into the canyons . Those programs never made it out . We 'll have them back in no time , sir , long before the interrupt interface . We 'd better , null unit . I 'll be lucky if the mcp doesn 't blast me into a dead zone . I want those conscripts ! [ flynn ] what is it ? What do you see ? Watch it . Watch it . Come on , you little bugger . [ ram ] look at that . When do we pay our visit to the old master control ? What ? There 's just three of us . Well , if you know anybody who 's got an army for rent , that 's fine , But my user told me to go take that sucker out , Or I 'm never getting out of here . We can 't get to the mcp ... Without the help of my user . I have to get to that input / output tower , And communicate with him . Well , good . Check in with alan . Maybe he knows what 's- - What 's that ? That ... Is just ... What I need right now . Oh , it 's nice . Incredible . [ tron ] boy , you forget how good the power feels ... Until you get to a pure source . [ laughing ] My friends , my fellow conscripts , we have scored . I feel so much better . Pursuit force reporting . No sign of escaped units . Moving into next sector . Thank you . I can feel it . Feel what ? You okay ? Alan-1 . Let 's move out ! Come on , flynn , put a cork in it . One second ! Ahhh ! Range , 9 . Mark , 45 . 48 degrees . Hold it . Hold it . Fire ! Ram , flynn , do you read me ? Pursuit force reporting . Two escaped units de-rezzed . No ! Tron unit heading into next sector . Ram ? Ram ! Come on ! We gotta get outta here ! No sign of life . Looks like we got ' em . Continue pursuit of remaining conscript . Acknowledged . Proceeding towards sector frontier . We 're gonna make it , ram . I just gotta find you a place to rest . Hang in there , ram . This looks like a good spot . Those tanks won 't find us here . Okay . I thought this was supposed to be easy . [ groans ] [ beeping ] Hey , what 's going on ? You see this ? You shouldn 't be able to do that . Now for some real user power . Hey , this looks promising . This is just like the old arcade grips . Let 's get this show on the road . Now we 're smokin ' ! How can you steal a recognizer ? Hey , you okay ? You don 't look so good . We 'll get you fixed up . Hang on . Come here . Oh , my user ! Users are users . They- - Are you a user ? Flynn , Help tron . Ram ! Ram ? Damn recognizer . Thing just goes straight . I gotta get to that I / o tower . Program alu , request additional information for sector two . Prepare hangar for game simulation transport . Attention all units , lock onto matrix code . Prepare for digital beam transport . Activate hangar doors . What 's the progress on the simulation ? 30 , 56 , 99 are correct . Limited four and eight are missing . Don 't scream . Yori ! 30 , 56 , 99 are correct . Limited four and eight are missing . No , I- - Tron ! Oh ! Yori . I knew you 'd escape . They haven 't built a circuit that could hold you . Listen ! We have to make plans . Where can we go ? This way , quickly . Hey ! Hold it right there ! Yes ? What do you mean , " yes " ? Yes . Is that all you can say ? No . Anything else ? Yes . Positive and negative , huh ? You 're a bit . Yes . Where 's your program ? Isn 't he gonna miss you ? - no . - I 'm your program . - yes . - another mouth to feed . Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes ! Watch out for nested macros . Who are these weirdos ? Inoperative data pushers . [ tron ] control programs ! Come on . Pretty good drivin ' , huh ? Oh ! [ bit ] no ! Who asked you ? [ warning siren ] [ bit ] no-no-no-no ! Aah ! This baby doesn 't handle so good in town . No . What 's this do ? How ' bout this one ? No . No . [ flynn ] here comes a headache . Aah ! No-no-no-no ! We gotta stop this thing ! Yes ! [ flynn ] I 'm glad you agree ! Uh , I 'm fine . No problem . Oh , this town is full of live ones . This is where tron said he was going . Losing flynn . I don 't believe this . Halt ! More guards . They don 't see us . I 'll go first . Are you all right ? Yeah . Let 's do that some more . I think the guard saw me . Come on ! Halt . Dumont . I can 't stand this commotion . What do you want ? I 've come to communicate with my user . Difficult proposition . Difficult proposition at best . Why , I could be de-rezzed just for letting you in here . They hate this tower . They 'd close it down if they dared . They keep me around just in case one of them ... Wants to deal with the other world once in a while . Dumont ! My user has information that could- - Could make this a free system again . [ chuckle ] no , really ! You 'd have programs lined up to use this place , And no mcp looking over your shoulder . When you 've been in the system as long as I have , You hear many promises , many reassurances , Many brave plans . Please , dumont ! The guards are coming . There they are with the guardian . All right , yori . All right . Who is your user , program ? Alan-1 . He calls me . May I pass ? All that is visible ... Must grow beyond itself , And extend into the realm of the invisible . You may pass , my friend . The tower guardian is helping him . He thinks . Bring in the logic probe . [ sark ] more power ! It 's begun . [ alan ] tron , location query . Confirm . Confirmed , alan-1 . [ alan ] I am creating the information on your disk ... That will erase the mcp and change the system . Dedicate yourself to getting the disk into the heart ... Of the mcp . This interface is located at its base . We will not be able to communicate again unless you succeed . Go ! This is the key to a new order . This code disk means freedom . I think they 're breaking in . Thank you , dumont . Hurry ! The users are waiting . [ sark ] dumont ? Where 's the program ? What program ? Take him ! Stay close . If I can just get us on the scanning transport beam , This solar sail simulation will take us across the game sea , Out of this domain , back into the central computer . Look out ! Aah ! Aah ! Commander , you 've enjoyed all the power you 've been given , haven 't you ? I wonder how you 'd take to working in a pocket calculator . We did take care of that user you sent us . Incompetent zero . Now you 've got two renegade programs ... Flying all over the system in a stolen simulation . We 'll get them . It 's only a matter of time . You 've almost reached your decision gate , And I can 't spare you any more time . End of line . - it 's me- - flynn ! - flynn ! - greetings , program . - you 're alive ! Barely . Yeah , I , uh- - Where 's ram ? He didn 't make it . Come on . Lora . This is flynn . The one who busted me out . Lora ? Well , then I owe him some thanks . No , it 's , uh , no big deal . I ought to know my way around the lightcycle . I wrote the program . You wrote the program ? It 's time I level with you . - I 'm what you guys call a user . - you 're a user ? I took a wrong turn somewhere . If you are a user , Everything you 've done has been according to a plan , right ? [ laughs ] you wish . You guys know what it 's like . You keep doing what it looks like you 're supposed to , no matter how crazy it seems . That 's the way it is for programs , yes . Hate to disappoint you , pal , but most of the time , that 's the way it is for users too . Stranger and stranger . So , nice-looking ship you got here . What do you want done with the tower guardian- - dumont ? Put him with the others ? No , bit brain , prepare him for inquisition . I need a little bit of relaxation . First , rezz up the carrier for pursuit . One other thing . Don 't think anymore . I do the thinking around here . [ yori ] this isn 't going to be easy . If those grid bugs get us , we 've had it . Had enough ? What do you want ? I 'm busy . Busy dying , you worn out excuse for an old program . Yes , I 'm old . Old enough to remember the mcp when it was a chess program . He started small , and he 'll end small . Very funny , dumont . Maybe I should keep you around just to make me laugh . What 's happening ? Power surge in the mcp . - we have to get off this beam . - I can 't . There isn 't another junction for seven or eight nanoseconds . - there 's another beam ! - it 's too far . He 's creating a junction . Did we make it ? Yeah . Hurray for our side . Is he de-rezzing ? No , but I couldn 't tell you why not . I 'm all in one piece . I guess I 'm still with you . [ groans ] tell the guy with the jackhammer to lay off . - how 'd you do that ? - elementary physics- - A beam of energy can always be diverted . Are we there yet , mommy ? Sark ! Dumont ! Yori ! Tron ? Tron 's dead . Who 's that ? That is a user , dumont . He came here to help us . Tron believed in him . If the users can no longer help us , we 're lost . So , we have erased that program- - No . - you were de-rezzed . - not me , sark . There 's nothing special about you . You 're just an ordinary program . So are you , one that should have been erased . You 're nothing . Take that program to the holding pit . Please , don 't take- - I 'm taking our friend here ... And some other religious fanatics to master control . When I disembark , This ship and everything that remains on board ... Will automatically de-rezz . This means you . Move on ! Immediate vectors detached . Route us to the mcp . I want to get rid of this dead weight , And catch a transport beam to the game domain . These walls- - yori , something 's happening . Hey . You all right ? I still have power . Sark doesn 't know that . Leave me alone . We 've failed . We 're only gonna fail if we give up ! Come on , look , the wall ! Yori . You brought me back . How ? Why did you bring me back ? I need your help . Come on ! Do something with these controls ! I 'm on it . The mcp , it 's the heart of the whole system . I feel a presence . Another warrior is on the mesa . [ tron ] sark ! We 're getting closer . I don 't know how you survived . Slave , it doesn 't matter . Prepare to terminate . All programs have a desire to be useful . But in moments , you will no longer seek communication ... With each other or your superfluous users . You will each be part of me . Together , we will be complete . You should have joined me . We 'd have made a great team . - you 're very persistent . - I 'm also better than you . [ mcp ] sark ? All my functions are now yours . Take them . Sark ? Sark ? Look at that ! Your user can 't help you now , my little program . I got it . Steer us over by the beam . Right next to it . What good will that do ? I 'm gonna jump . It 's the only way to help tron . Don 't . You 'll be de-rezzed . Don 't worry . Come on , let 's go ! We did it ! That 's nice . We thought you were dead . Where 's flynn ? It was incredible . He threw himself into the beam and distracted the mcp ... Just long enough for you to get the disk in . He saved us . He really did it . Video warriors , look at the I / o towers . Every tower is lighting up . Priority one ! [ laughing ] Try to look official . Here comes the boss . Pick me up in an hour . Thanks . Greetings , programs . SiliconChip

 JEFFREY : We got to jump , Harriet . I 'd jump in a fire if I had to . Stop ! ( BARKING ) What 's going on here ? This here is my slave . I own her . Harriet Tubman . ( ROARS ) I 'd like to see them fight as a pair . ( GRUNTING ) Kill me , Spartacus . Give the Romans what they want . ( YELLING ) BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! ( MEN GRUNTING ) What 's he doing with a net ? Spartacus will use the net to trip his opponent . You were right , Bitiatus , he is the best gladiator in Capua . ( PLUMMETING ) Noble fight , my friend . ( GRUNTING ) I gotta be doing something wrong . Bogg . I know . I know . It 's gonna be another one of those days . ( PEOPLE APPLAUDING ) CICERO : Bravo ! Wonderful , Bitiatus . Simply marvelous . Yes , it is indeed . I 'm glad Your Excellency is pleased . Pleased ? I 'm amazed . It 's the first time I 've ever seen men fly through the air like that . It 's the first time for me , too . I think they mean us . Where are we , Bogg ? ( BEEPING ) How does the south of Italy , 73 B.C. Grab you ? That explains the gladiators . You got any idea what 's wrong ? It 's flashing red . I don 't know . I 'm not too great with this part of history . CICERO : They came out of nowhere . How did you pull off such a feat ? Well , surely , Your Greatness , I would not pretend to be more clever than you . I 'm sure you see right through my little trick . A large catapult ? Oh , Cicero , if only more members of the Senate shared your brilliance . And your inventiveness . It 's no wonder you are the greatest gladiator trainer in the Republic . Now , who are these human projectiles ? What are their names ? They 're new , Your Grace . In fact , they just arrived . Names , slaves ! I 'm Bogg . This is Jeffrey . Hi . Jeffrey and Bogg are strange names for slaves . Not to mention their attire . Strange names for anyone , sire . They must have been captured from one of the outer provinces . The small one is cute , isn 't he , Aunt Octavia ? OCTAVIA : Yes , he is . Very cute . I 'd like to see them fight as a pair . Against that gladiator we saw this morning . Tomeris . Yes . And I 'd like to see them fight to the death . To the death ? Think , kid . I 'd kind of like to know what we 're supposed to be doing here before I get myself killed . I 'm thinking , I 'm thinking . Come on . No talking , slaves . All right . Take it easy , guys . Cicero , Your Magnificence , Your Eminence , I love a bloody fight to the end as much as anyone , but we 're but a humble school whose purpose is for the training of gladiators for sale . And if I may be so bold as to say , a dead gladiator is not worth the ground he 's buried in . Unless you want to buy the loser . I don 't buy losers . All right , not to the death , and I will buy the winner . A most wise decision , My Lord . And of course , I want to buy Spartacus . Bogg , it 's Spartacus . What ? Spartacus led the first slave revolt in history . He led it from Capua in 73 B.C. I knew you 'd come through . I want him shipped out to Rome immediately . You will be the finest gladiator in my stable . I 'm no animal for your stable . Seize him . Well , he has a most rebellious spirit . Well , I 'll break him of that , or else he 'll become meat for my lions . Bogg , once a gladiator goes to Rome , he never comes back . And the revolt was led from here . So , we go to Rome and make sure he comes back . That means we have to win this fight . Don 't worry , kid . It 's in the bag . Here are your weapons . You expect us to fight with these ? ( LAUGHING ) At least give us some shields . The Romans had a great sense of humor . ( ROARING ) Bogg , this is it . Don 't try anything heroic . That can 't be human . ( ROARING ) David beat Goliath . I was there , kid , it was a lucky shot . Stay away from him , let me handle this . Come on , Bogg . Look at him . You can 't beat him by yourself . You know , kid , you might be right . Easy , big fellow . Come on , easy now . Watch it , Bogg ! JEFFREY : Look out ! JEFFREY : Bogg , duck ! Stay away from him . The guy 's an animal . Bogg , look ! Bogg , over here ! Now , Bogg ! Now ! We did it . I told you we would . ( LAUGHING ) The bigger they are , the harder they fall . Yeah . The big ape . Now , it 's off to Rome ... See , I 'm afraid of heights . You big ape ! I think you get down . ( ALL APPLAUDING ) Bogg , are you hurt ? Nothing a week with Florence Nightingale wouldn 't cure . Wonderful fight . Have Tomeris sent to me in Rome immediately . Certainly . Well , we tried . Yeah , but now we don 't go to Rome . Please , Father , will you buy the boy ? You promised me that you would buy me my very own slave for my birthday . But that 's not for six months , dear . Go ahead , buy him . And buy his friend , too . I have a feeling his good looks will attract the women of Rome to the arena . Oh , please , Father . It would be fun to see the three of them fight again . All right , I 'll buy them all . Thank you , Father . BITIATUS : Guards , have all three of them sent to Rome . I 'm going to love having him feed me grapes . Yes , and I 'm sure his friend might prove useful also . It seems as though your sister has taken a fancy to your new slave . Yes , this has happened before . Funny , they always seem to be among the first to die in the arena . See , I told you it would be much more fun having me as your friend instead of your slave . Until now , I 've never had a friend , only slaves . Well , now you have a friend , and I 'll do things for you because I want to make you happy , not because I have to . That makes it nicer . Okay , what 'll it be ? Your wish is my command . I want to be able to do something for you . To make you happy . Really ? Well , there is one thing that would really help me out . But it 's a pretty big favor to ask . You 're my friend . No favor is too big . ( WATER DRIPPING ) SPARTACUS : I 've got to go back to Capua . BOGG : I know . You know ? Sure , I mean , Capua was a whole lot better than this place . Capua is a terrible place . Men and women trained to be animals . And all for the pleasure of the Romans . It made me sick . Slavery has gone on a long time . Maybe it 's time somebody did something about it . I did do something . I was beginning to unite the other gladiators . I thought maybe we could form an army . Attempt a revolt . At Capua , the gladiators outnumber the guards . We would have had a good chance . You still have a chance . Not in Rome . Here we are outnumbered . For me it 's just a dream . Maybe someday someone else can lead it . ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) Hey , kid , where 'd you get the fancy clothes ? Never mind that . We 're getting out of here . Who 's this ? Don 't worry , he 's one of us . Where 'd you get the key ? Calpurnia 's gonna show us a way out of the house . What about the guards ? Don 't worry about the others . We slipped them mickeys . What 's a mickey ? Come on . Thanks a lot . I hope this won 't get you into a lot of trouble . Don 't worry , I can handle my father . ( WHISTLE BLOWING ) Come on . I 'll come back someday . I promise . GUARD : The gladiators have escaped ! Get them ! ( WHISTLE BLOWING ) What 's the trouble ? Spartacus and the other two new slaves have escaped . I want Spartacus back alive . The others , I don 't care . Yes , my Lord . ( WHISTLE BLOWING ) I have a feeling this isn 't going to be easy . I think you 're right . I have orders to spare your life , Spartacus . You die another day in the arena . I 'd like to take you with me . What about us ? You ? You and your friend aren 't so lucky . Take them both out and make an example out of them . BOGG : Come on , kid . I 'm right behind you . They 're running toward the market . BOGG : Get that torch , kid . Throw it in the oil . JEFFREY : What is that stuff ? Olive oil burns great , huh ? That should stop them . Yeah . There they are ! There 's no way out , kid . So hit it , Bogg . Hit the Omni . ( BEEPING ) ( PLUMMETING ) ( BEEPING ) Missouri , 1847 . America . It 's nice to be home . All countries are the same to me . All have excitement . All have women . All have problems . ( DOGS BARKING ) Bogg , look ! Let 's do something before they catch up to her and tear her apart . It 's okay ! Come on down ! Really , we have the dogs . Don 't worry . They won 't hurt you . Harriet , you come down here , right now . Andrew , Junior , get her down from there . Get away from her . What do you think you 're doing , boy ? What 's going on here ? Now , what 's it look like ? She 's a runaway . BOGG : A runaway what ? Slave . Slave ? But I thought this was America . It is . Where it 's legal to own slaves . Leastwise in this state . Now this here is my slave . I own her . I won her in a poker game . Harriet Tubman . Bogg , she was never in Missouri . Well , she is now . You . Better let go of her if you know what 's good for you . Stealing a slave is a hanging offense . Bogg , we can 't let them take her . Well , there 's not much we can do . I 'm sorry . Those two must be abolitionists . You see the clothes that young feller 's wearing ? You talk about strange . Yeah . You ain 't kidding . Bogg , we have to help her . Harriet Tubman was an escaped slave who worked on the Underground Railroads . She helped to free hundreds of other slaves . All right . All right , but we have to do it fast . We 've got to get back to Spartacus . Okay . Let 's find out where they 're keeping her and break her out . No , forget it . I got a better idea . This is the dumbest idea you 've ever had . There 's nothing dumb about winning enough money to get Harriet 's freedom back . There is when you don 't know the first thing about playing cards . Hey , you know , I was a voyager long before I met you . I was playing cards when they were still made out of rocks . Must 've been tough to shuffle . Come on , Bogg , I still say we break her out tonight and I can 't do it alone . It 's no use . Look what happened when we tried to break Spartacus out . We 're out numbered . My way is fast , easy , and painless . Okay . Go ahead . Chicken out . Are you calling me chicken ? If the feathers fit . Okay , that 's it . I 'm going on that boat , and I 'm gonna win Harriet 's freedom back . If you don 't like it , you 're on your own . Bogg . Smart grownups give me a pain . BOY : Five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten ... JEFFREY : What are you doing ? Counting the herd . Herd of what ? Herd of frogs . I had sixteen head yesterday . I think one escaped in the night . What do you do with them ? Jump them . See which one can jump the furthest . I 've won six straight contests . My name 's Jeffrey . Mine 's Sam . You come on in on the riverboat with your folks ? No . I don 't have any parents . ( FROG CROAKING ) Oh , yeah . I lost a pap a while back . You 're not alone , are you ? Oh , no . I 'm here with a friend . At least I was . Boy , grownups can really be jerks . Yeah . I don 't have much use for them myself . You and your friend get in a fight ? Yeah . We saw a runaway slave get captured this morning . I want to go back and help her escape again . But my friend won 't help me . He says it 's a bad idea . Well , I have to go along with your friend there . Ain 't right to help a slave escape . Well , you think slavery is right ? Well , preachers don 't say it 's wrong , teachers don 't neither . Even the government says it 's all right . Well , you wouldn 't want to be a slave , would you ? Well , heck , no ! Well , then why do you think it 's right for anyone else to be one ? I don 't know . It 's just ... I 've seen colored folk as slaves all my life . I just kind of got used to it . It just seems natural . Well , it 's not natural , it 's wrong . One day everyone 's gonna see that , and it 's gonna be illegal in every state . Well , I still don 't know if slavery 's right or wrong . But like my ma always says , I 'm not one to put down a chance to get into trouble . So if you 're gonna break that slave out tonight , well , I 'll help you . How much have I made so far ? Fifteen thousand on this trip . Oh , yeah , and the slave . What can I do for you ? Well , sir , I 'm here to play cards . Well , I 'm expecting a few more players in a while . You 're welcome to join us . I don 't want any others . I want you . Well , what 's your stake ? What is it , Sandy ? Looks like a Spanish doubloon . But it can 't be . It would be 300 years old . It 's real . What do you do , polish this thing every day ? It looks brand new . How much is it worth ? About ... Two hundred , I guess . Well , I 'm sorry , sir , you see , two hundred ain 't much of a stake . I play for a $ 5,000 minimum . Two hundred will barely last you for the first deal . That 's if I lose . I 'm not going to lose . Well , I do like a man with confidence . Change it , Sandy . All right . Five card draw . Jacks to open . Five card what ? Draw . Phineas Frog ? Phineas Bogg . SAM : Well , do you think he has a chance ? What are you gonna do ? Two no trump . Does that answer your question ? ( KNOCKING ON WINDOW ) Could you excuse me for a minute ? Oh , yeah , sure , but your cards , they stay . Of course . Yeah . What do you want ? I 'm busy . You 're not supposed to be playing bridge . You 're supposed to be playing poker . Poker ? What 's that ? I thought you said you were a card expert . Yeah , cards , not poker . But poker is cards . You know , three of a kind , straight flush , full house . Snibbitz ! Snibbitz . I played that game in Hungary , learned it from the Gypsies . Bogg , give it up . Harriet 's on board ship , we can break her out . Are you kidding ? Now that I know what game we 're playing , it 's a cinch . Last time I played Snibbitz I won 12 goats . See you later . Bogg , wait ! I know it doesn 't look like it , but he usually knows what he 's doing . You 're right . It doesn 't look like it . I just guess we 're gonna have to do this ourselves . Come on . That must be Harriet 's cabin . We gotta get that guy away from the door . Come on , I have an idea . What a jumper ! Here , froggy . Come here , froggy . Here ... ( CRASHING ) ( CROAKING ) I knew he couldn 't resist Algebra . He 's the best jumper in the state . Come on . Let 's go get the keys to the cabin . JEFFREY : Harriet . What are you ... There 's no time to explain . We 're going to help you escape . But you boys are going to get into a lot of trouble . Let us handle that . Come on . Hey ! You hold it right there . Hold it ! Stop ! Hey ! JEFFREY : We got to jump , Harriet . I 'd jump in a fire if I had to . You boys best bring her back here . JEFFREY : Quick , grab a pole . Let 's get out of here . MAN : You don 't bring her back here , you boys are in big trouble . Come on . Pole , pole ! I 'm poling , I 'm poling . Well , now , don 't look so down , Mr. Bogg , you did win a few hands . It 's been a very pleasant evening . I 'm going to make a comeback . You have to keep playing . Oh , no , I don 't . Excuse me , Mr. Bastaine . Yes ? Sir , your slave has escaped . Oh , not again . There 's a posse chasing her down right now . She won 't get far . That slave is more trouble than she 's worth . I wish I 'd won me a horse . Yes , sir . Well , I ain 't gonna lose any sleep over no good-for-nothing slave girl . You tell that sheriff he 's got my permission to hang her . Wait a minute . You can 't do that ! Oh , sure I can . I own her . Okay , if you feel that way , why not play me a game of cards for her ? Listen , I won that woman from her former master when he used her to cover my $ 500 raise and I figure that 's what she 's worth to me . And it looks like you got what , less than $ 20 there . $ 20 and this . What in the world is this ? BOGG : A very rare pocket watch . I guarantee you 'll never see another like it . What 's that red light ? Aren 't those Swiss watchmakers amazing ? I don 't know , Mr. Bastaine , but there 's no telling what this thing is worth . I mean , it 's one of a kind . Well , I figure it 's worth about as much as that pain in the neck slave girl that I 'm just gonna hang anyway . So I tell you what , Mr. Bogg . One hand of showdown , your watch against my slave girl now . Five cards face up , ( BEEPING ) Best hand wins . I still don 't see why we didn 't stay on the raft . The only way that raft can go is downriver . And downriver is south . And that gets us deeper in slave territory . I got a place up the road that we can stay for the night . We can 't stop now . We got to keep going . She 's right . The only way we can get Harriet to freedom is on foot . But I ain 't going deeper in those woods at night . Crazy Indian out there , who picks up people and eats them alive . There 's worse things than man-eating Indians . The Indian is only half of it . There 're snakes and quicksand . It 's dangerous enough by daylight . Nighttime is suicide . I should 've known . Queens have always given me trouble . ( WOLF HOWLING ) What 's that ? Could be Indians . Maybe even pirates . You have some imagination . ( WOLF HOWLING ) I hope . ( SHUSHING ) When you 're on the run , every sound makes your skin crawl . How many times you been on the run ? Lots . I 'm trying to get back to Maryland . Join a thing called the Underground Railroad to help slaves like me get to the North . Heck , you don 't need no railroad . We 'll get you your freedom . I 'm not going to the railroad to be free . I 'm going to work to help other slaves win their freedom . Slavery ... It 's the worst thing one human being can put on another . I won 't rest until there 's no such thing as slaves . ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) I hear footsteps . It 's Indian Joe ! No , son , it 's the law . Bat 's breath ! Well , not shaping up too well for you , Mr. Bogg . Yeah , well , I still have another card coming , so why don 't you just deal it ? SAM : My ma was right , I 'm headed for an early grave . HARRIET : I 'm sorry , boys , I really am . I never thought that anybody but me would have to sacrifice for my freedom . If I had to , Harriet , I 'd do it all over again . Yeah , me , too . Well , heck , there 's something extravagant about being hung at the age of 12 . Well , good work , Sheriff . Well , what do you want to do with them , Mr. Bastaine ? Hang them ? BOGG : Nobody 's going to be hung . Bogg ! You 're friends with these two boys , aren 't you ? That 's right . So maybe you had something to do with this little escape . Most definitely . Okay . Take him , too , boys . Except for one thing . She 's not a slave . JEFFREY : What ? What are you talking about ? She 's a free woman . He 's right , Sheriff . He won her from me a couple of hours ago in a game . That fool woke up the Justice of the Peace just to sign her freedom papers . Let them go , all of them . But , Sheriff ... Let them go . The law 's the law . You can 't hold a free person if they haven 't broken the law . Bogg , you did it ! Yeah . Pulled a full house of three ladies . Praise the Lord . Bogg , I 'm really sorry I doubted you . I should have known all along you could do it . Jeffrey , you are as stubborn as a mule . You had to go out there and do it your own way , no matter what anybody says or how it might turn out , just because you thought it was right . I like that . You act like a real voyager . ( SHIP HORN BLOWING ) HARRIET : Well , I want to thank you for my boat ticket and my new dress . But I feel bad you spent all your money on it . That 's okay , we don 't need money where we 're going . So , how does it feel to finally be free ? I 've always felt free in my heart , and I always will , but I 'm still a slave . No , you 're not , I won you fair and square . Now , you all have been wonderful to me , and I appreciate everything you 've done , but that gambler wasn 't my master or the man before him . I ran away from my real master in Maryland , and he still owns me . So you 're still a runaway . And these are useless . No , no . Not to me they 're not . With these at least people will think I 'm free . And I can get back to Maryland and help people gain their true freedom . ( SHIP HORN BLOWING ) Boat 's leaving . Bye , everybody . I 'll never forget what you done . Bye ! You 're gonna make it , Harriet , I know you will . She 's gonna be a great woman . She already is . WOMAN : Sam ? Sam Clemens ? It 's my mother . She 's gonna kill me . You better get back this minute ! I haven 't been home since yesterday . And I left a catfish in the washtub . See you later , fellows . Sam Clemens ! Somebody special ? Only my favorite writer in the whole world , Mark Twain . You know , Huckleberry Finn ? Huckleberry who ? You know , Huck and Tom Sawyer . They take this runaway slave down the river on a raft and ... Hey , wait a minute . Green light . Time to get back to Rome . Spartacus needs us . But , Bogg , that 's just what we did ... Say goodbye to Hannibal . Goodbye . ( PLUMMETING ) Bogg ? ( EXCLAIMS ) I hope I didn 't wake you . You big hunk of slave . How did you know I was dreaming about you ? Bogg ! Not now , kid . Now , Bogg ! So the runaway has returned to entertain my sister . And in another strange costume . I can explain , really . Take him ! You , I will spare . Because I do not wish to break my little girl 's heart . For some unknown reason she has an attachment for you . But for your friend , I 'm giving him the opportunity to entertain all of Rome . In the arena ? Of course . A fight to the death with our greatest gladiator . I can 't make up my mind who I 'd rather see die . You or Spartacus . CICERO : Your slave did attract the people of Rome to the arena . SPARTACUS : When I heard you two had escaped , I was filled with hope . I thought for certain I 'd hear that a slave revolt had taken place in Capua . BOGG : It 's still gonna happen , and you 're gonna lead it . My friend , you don 't understand . We fight each other today in the arena . It 's a fight to the death . One of us must die . It won 't come to that . I promise . If the Romans suspect we 're not fighting with all our strength , they 'll have us crucified . Believe me . It 's easier to die by the sword . No , Jeffrey , absolutely not ! But I told you , Calpurnia , you 're our only chance . I helped you escape once , and if guards had caught you , I would have lost you forever . But I told you I 'd come back , and I did . Besides , we 're talking about the lives of two people . We can 't let them die in the arena . If I help your friends escape , do you promise to stay here with me ? I can 't promise you that . Besides , a good friend doesn 't do favors with strings attached . It 's hard being a good friend . It 's even harder leaving one . ( CROWD CHEERING ) When are the gladiators coming out ? CICERO : Bring them . ( CROWD CHEERING ) This is unbelievable . What a turnout ! The Romans enjoy their spectacles . Today they want to see blood . We who are about to die , salute you . Let it begin . It 's time to do battle . Just make it look good for a while . I 'm gonna get you out of this . Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Get up , you must fight . Fight ! Fight ! Your gladiator , Bogg , doesn 't seem to be fighting . Oh , he will . He will . CICERO : How about a small wager ? OCTAVIA : As you wish . Get up ! Fight ! See ? I told you he would fight . But that doesn 't mean he will win . Just take it easy , will you ? The Romans want a real fight . If they don 't get it , they 'll kill us both . Come on , kid , where are you ? JEFFREY : Be careful , I don 't want you getting hurt because of me . Don 't worry about me . Oh , Jeffrey , I 'm going to miss you . Hey , I 'm going to miss you , too . But be realistic . The lives of two little people don 't add up to a hill of beans in this crazy republic . I 'll never forget you , Jeffrey . Never . ( CROWD CHEERING ) Oh , fight , Bogg . Fight ! Your slave fights well . Good day . Good day . My slave would like to stand in my father 's chariot . GUARD : Sorry . No one 's allowed on the Senator 's chariot . But my father said I can and I ... Hey , get away from there . JEFFREY : Here 's looking at you , kid . ( YELLING ) CICERO : They seem to be tiring . It won 't be long now . Kill me , my friend . End a slave 's pain . No . Do it now . I 'll make it look like you won valiantly . No ! Kill me , Spartacus . Give the Romans what they want . Always be their slave . ( CROWD BOOING ) Sorry , Romans . You 'll see no one die in the arena today . Take them ! And hang them both from the same cross ! ( YELLING ) JEFFREY : Grab on ! Grab on ! BOGG : It 's about time , kid . What took you so long ? Are you kidding ? Do you know how hard these things are to drive ? JEFFREY : Goodbye , Calpurnia . Goodbye , Jeffrey . I don 't understand why you two can 't come along . You could help me lead the revolt . Slaves only need one leader , Spartacus . Someone they 'll trust and follow . That 's you . I 'll do my best . Goodbye , my friend . How does it turn out , kid ? Is the slave revolt a success ? Not exactly . Spartacus and his followers fought bravely , but the Roman army was just too strong for them and they were defeated . The toughest part of the job . Every story in history doesn 't have a happy ending . I guess we went to a lot of trouble for nothing . Nothing ? Spartacus didn 't die for nothing , Bogg . He inspired slaves everywhere to try to be free . Slaves like Harriet Tubman . Spartacus would have liked that . Yeah . You know , we deserve a vacation . Let 's go to a time zone where we know that there 's nothing wrong . All right ! Where to ? The Orient ? Tahiti ? ( DINGS ) Hannibal ! Hannibal ? What for ? Snibbitz . I gotta win my lucky coin back . You don 't even have a stake to get back into the game . We 'll sell our clothes . Look , I 'll win us enough to take a first-class vacation , anywhere you want . It 's a cinch , kid . Yeah , it 's a cinch . I 'm not going to let you do it . BOGG : Hey ! Jeffrey , come back here ! Smart kids give me a pain . JEFFREY ...

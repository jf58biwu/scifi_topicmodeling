 - Herculanium . - TARRANT : So you can 't cut it ? - Can 't cut it , burn it , blast it . - Can you open it ? - You can or you can 't ? - Very difficult . DAYNA : Very necessary . Unless you feel like living on nuts and berries for the rest of your life . - Eh ? - Food , Vila . What we 've got will last us maybe three weeks if you can 't open that door . We can 't get back to Scorpio and without that ship we 're as much prisoners here as we were on Terminal . ( Bleeping ) I 'm not sure about this . I know it 's a voice recognition input , but why is it just here ? - Well , can 't you bypass it ? - No , they 're foolproof . - Perhaps ... - And before you say it , they 're Avon-proof , too . I 'll look for him anyway . Orac ! Orac ! At the present stage of development , the chances of achieving critical restructure are less than 11 % . Never mind that , Orac , I need teleport now . Giving due consideration to the probabilities I must assume that your request is a frivolous one . What request ? Avon , where are you ? What do you want ? DAYNA : Avon , can you hear me ? Avon , can you hear ... Avon ? Well , there 's always rodents of one sort or another . I 'm a growing lad , Vila . Rats are not the answer to my diet . But , Orac , can you get a fix on him ? The locator fixing device was an integral part of his transceiver - which is no longer operating . - Problem ? Something 's happened to Avon and Orac 's being difficult . I am not being difficult , but functioning according to request . - What happened to the transceiver ? - It is no longer functioning . - Yes , but why ? - There is a 72 % probability that it was damaged by a hostile agency . - What was the last thing he said ? - He requested immediate teleportation . - But the teleport doesn 't work . - Precisely . Orac , give us a fix on Avon 's last known position . Grid 290 by 428 . - Nothing . - There , zoom in on that . - Right , I 'm going to take a look . - Yes , me , too . - What about me ? - There 's a door to open , remember ? And there 's a lady with a gun wandering about , remember ? Soolin 's nowhere on the base , Vila . You 're safe . Hey ! If she 's out on the surface , maybe she got Avon . Who is he do you think ? He must have come in on the Scorpio . There 's no other way . - Should we check ? - I shall . You follow . Sir , we have the intruder . - His equipment and gun . - Oh , bring him in , bring him in . - Let 's see what you 've got . - Bring him in . Well , don 't just stand there , woman . Bring meat ! Ale ! - You have a fetching way with women . - Who are you to address me like some joker ? - My name is Avon . - I don 't care what you call yourself . I am Gunn Sar , chief of the Hommiks . I rule by right of challenge , which means I 'm the biggest , toughest meanest son of a Seska on this planet . - I believe you . - You 'd better . - What 's the tally of challenges ? - 25 dead and one missing , sir . Oh , come on , Cato . Don 't quibble . Marquin fell backwards off the cliff . - Yes , sir . - So he 's dead . Like , you can 't say someone 's missing as such , not when they 've taken a dive into a bottomless gorge . No , sir . So , it 's 26 dead . The Council ruled it was 25 , sir , and one missing . 25 men lie dead who tried to stand against me . And one , if he 's not still falling , is no more than a greasy spot on the rocks , right ? - Impressive . - GUNN SAR : You killed two men . If I 'd known we were keeping score , I would have brought more ammunition . - What were you doing on my land ? - Your land ? With instruments and tools , speaking devices . A petroscope . You know what it is ? What were you looking for ? - Some crystals , nothing of any consequence . - What crystals ? - Dynamon . - Dynamon ? Dynamon ? You look like a man . You smell like a man . So ? So , what do you want with dynamon ? Orac was right . I 'd say there was a hostile agency , wouldn 't you ? Avon ! Avon ! - Shall I hold this out of the way ? - Yes , thank you , if you wouldn 't mind . ( Exclaiming in pain ) I am sorry , I didn 't mean to startle you . I thought you were a lady gunfighter . Just a minute , who are you ? Where do you come from ? Let me . I am Pella , of the Seska people . - Does this hurt ? - It did . How did you get in ? The secondary hatch was open . Your hand is badly bruised . Here . In 10 minutes , the pain and the bruise will be gone . - Do you think you can open the door ? - I can open the lock . - And can you break the computer code ? - No , but Avon can . - You seem to know a lot about it ? - The only way off this planet is through that door . - Where is Avon ? - Outside . - Are the others looking for him ? - Yes , we think he may have had an accident . - How do you know about the others ? - Your friend hasn 't had an accident . - He 's in trouble . The Hommiks have taken him . - Hommiks ? - Is that bad ? - For Avon , very . - So , you want dynamon crystals ? - Yes . - They 're rare . - So I 've been told . So rare , there aren 't any . What there was have all been dug up . - Right ? - I 'll take your word for it . Anyway , they 're useless . Expensive baubles for the ladies . So , why do you want them ? - My computer suggested they might be useful . - Your computer ! Not your books or your mates or your woman or your assistant , but your computer . You talk to computers ? You understand computers ? AVON : Don 't you ? Watch what you 're doing , you snivelling sack of offal ! So , you want to be number 27 ? Don 't you mean number 26 ? Go ! Make preparation . So there 's two tribes , the Hommiks and the Seskas ? - The Seska are not a tribe . - Not too close . The gap is all connected with the thickness of the door . So what 's the difference between Seskas and Hommiks ? - How do you know how thick it is ? - By the stress pattern . - I don 't see anything . - Not without this you won 't . - Oh , I see . And what does that tell you ? - The weight of the door . I know the height , the width , what it 's made of , how dense it is . - And the computer works it out ? - Computer ? Who needs computers ? - I just have to look at it . - You must be very clever . That 's what I keep telling everyone . They even believed me in CF-1 . - CF-1 ? - A sort of academy , when I was a boy . They chose me as technical advisor for the escape . Escape ? From an academy ? - Perhaps academy was the wrong word . - What about this ? - Do you know what it is ? - Oh , yes . I just don 't know what it 's for . And they didn 't teach this in ... academy ? There 's a switch . When the door is closed , every 48 hours , Dorian must say a code word to reset the timing . Is that 48 hours standard time ? Earth standard time . This planet is very like Earth , I think . - That is why the Seska came here . - And what happens if Dorian - doesn 't reset the switch ? - There 's a nuclear compression charge . - Yes , there would be . - The whole base would ... Oh , well . Nuts and berries it is , then . - Nuts and berries ? - Or rodents . - You speak like a Hommik . - What do you eat , then ? - We have a hydroponic dome . - And the nutrients ? Dorian brings them from Onus Two . Well , you better start thinking nuts and berries , then . - Dorian 's dead . - Dead ? 200 years , but he made it in the end . I didn 't think anyone would be sorry . Least of all me . This could go at any time , couldn 't it ? ( Beeping ) I must go . No , wait , what about this ? Pella ... I 'm sorry , Vila , truly , but I must go . Don 't let me stop you . Pella , quickly , you must hurry . The others are at the main entrance . - Orac knows more than he 's saying . - So what do we do ? - You can 't put thumbscrews on a computer . - Oh , he 'll answer . We just have to ask the right questions , that 's all . - Did you see her ? - Who ? Pella , a young woman . She was here a moment ago . - What are you talking about ? - We 've got to get out of here . This whole place ... There 's a nuclear compression charge , we 've got to move . - Vila , take it easy . - It could go at any time ! Let 's just take one thing at a time . This young woman ... I am Gunn Sar , slayer of Mavarik . Lord of the Hommiks . I rule by the strength of my right arm and by my left arm and by the ... - When Gunn Sar dies in combat , the victor is Lord . - ALL : Hurray ! - I 've got to say all that . - Tradition . Well , old Mavarik was 63 . He had it coming anyway . Gunn Sar will live ! - ALL : Gunn Sar will live ! - Pick a weapon . I 'll have a neutron blaster . No neutron blasters . - In that case I 'll have a glove . - A glove ? - A glove . - A glove . - Get up , Gunn Sar . - Kill him . ( Gunn Sar groaning ) Kill him , Gunn Sar . Get him , Gunn Sar ! - Come on . - Come on . ( Bleeping ) An ordinary domestic heliofusion rod . You haven 't seen one , have you ? Don 't ! All that underground heat , light , power . And you never considered where it came from . Put that thing back where it came from . Use his glove . The one being held by the Hommiks is called Avon . Well , does he concern us ? - Our future depends on him . Dorian is dead . - Dead ? - But the Scorpio ? - Without Avon , the Scorpio is lost . Watch him . I 've checked the secondary hatch . Locked , from the inside . - So she used the main entrance . - We used the main entrance . It was locked . Besides , if she came in that way , she would have tripped the surveillance alarm . - Then she 's still on the base . - I 've checked . There 's nobody here . All right , I 'm going mad . Comes of drinking and talking to myself . I could be lying of course . Have you considered that ? Vila , we 're not accusing you of lying or going mad . We just want to know how she got out . - If she was here . - And how she got in . I told you , the secondary hatch was open and she ... It wasn 't . I checked them both this morning . Well , look at this , I dropped the lance body right across it and the bruise ... I can 't see any bruise . No . Must be brain warp . Think I 'll just go off and die somewhere . - Vila . - What ? - The door . - Which door ? The door to the landing silo , how long before you free the lock ? Oh , that . I 'll need to switch the lance on . Course , we still need Avon . Have you ever seen a nuclear compression charge go off ? Everything gets sucked in . It 's like a mini black hole . Looks good . From a distance . - Do you think I should go with him in case ... - In case what ? He has got brain warp ? - Or a flask of booze . - No , leave him . That makes a difference , doesn 't it ? If you get the chance , Kate , go . Yes , all right , but I agree with Vila . I think we should get out of here . Abandon Scorpio when there 's every chance we can save her ? Look , we don 't know when the place is going up , we could have hours . - Or even minutes . - Seconds . If we can get through the door , we can operate the switch manually . Pretend it 's not there , just walk through it ? That 's what your Seska friend did with the hatches . - Perhaps she can show us how it 's done . - Tarrant , it 's serious . I 'm being serious . Orac ! Is it possible for a living person to pass through a solid , a hatch , without there being any material disturbance ? - The process is called teleportation . - Oh , well , nothing like stating the obvious . Could a person just teleport themselves as an act of will ? No , unless directed by an outside agency , matter transmuted to energy will merely dissipate at random . Could this have done it without us knowing ? I am exploring the possibility . Without a co-radiating crystal to focus the beam , the mechanism will operate at.001 % efficiency . Orac , a woman was inside this base and she 's not inside it now . Given that the hatch remained locked from the inside , how would she get out ? The logical alternatives are within the bounds of human reasoning . I suggest you consider them and leave me in peace to reflect on those matters which are not . Hey ! No ! Let me go . No ! ( Screams ) Don 't get too comfortable now , we 'll be back for you just as soon as the surgery is free . Avon ? You are Avon , aren 't you ? Perhaps I was somewhere else when they introduced us . - You 've been hurt . - Well , you could say that . However , the nuclear compression charge is set to detonate in precisely - three hours 24 minutes . - So you 've got to get that door open fast . - How long ? - The lance will be through in about an hour . But there 's still the computer code . We still need Avon . Do we ? Orac , can you interpret and break the computer code ? The code sequence is the numerical value of the letters contained in the word " Narcissus " . - No problem . - However , the device has a secondary trip relay . When the door is opened , the charge will detonate automatically . Are you telling us there 's no way to reach that override switch ? One way . The same way by which a woman passed through a hatch which was later seen to be locked from the inside . - How do we find that woman ? - The information you require is on the chronicle discs in the records locker . Now will you please return me to the control room where I have work to do ? - Can you walk ? - Very likely . But just at the moment I can 't think of too many places to go . There was a girl with me when we were captured . We 've got to find her . She 's very young . They 're going to operate on her . - And then on me . - Operate ? Why ? So that we will no longer be Seska . - Seska ? - When our spirit is broken , we give them sons . The daughters are left to die on the hillside . Sometimes we are able to find them in time . The Hommiks are regressives . They reverted to primitive tribalism hundreds of years ago . It 's all they know . Now please , if you care at all , will you help me with this door ? - There 's a large bolt on the other side . - The door is open . But there 's something blocking it . Or should I say someone ? - How do you suppose this happened ? - Please , we must hurry . Have you noticed that they 're all women ? So far we haven 't seen a single man on these discs . These are all that 's left . It 's as though history stops 20 years ago . This is the last . - Has Orac scanned them ? - Hm . For all the good it does us . The only person he treats with any respect is Avon . Interim report concerning the last engagement in the battle for A-X Ridge . At 08539 , defence losses numbered 18 dead and 7 taken . Estimated Hommik losses ; 0 . At 08611 , a nucleic burster was released in the procreation vault contaminating the Seska seminal stocks . ( Metallic thudding ) Survival threshold has been passed , with Seska strength now numbering 94 , which includes 52 infants . Maravik , conducting the Hommik deployment from the safety of his A-F Hill HQ , has called for an unconditional surrender . A rejection is already being drafted , but there is a growing feeling among the Seska remnant that women , even with the power we have could never ... The Seskas are women . All of them are women . And presumably the Hommiks were men . Looks like it was a war between the sexes . - And the men were winning . - What 's a nucleic burster ? A radiation flare . Very dirty . Last thing you 'd want in a procreation chamber . TARRANT : Wait a moment . ( Disc rewinding ) ... conducting the Hommik deployment from the safety of his A-F Hill HQ ... - A-F Hill ? A-X Ridge ? - That 's what the lady said . Well , then we can trace it back . All we need is the original point of reference . One of us will have to ask Orac . I 've finished . She 'll sleep now . Nina ! Why have you done this ? ( Groaning ) Nina , what have they done to you ? - How could you be a part of this ? - Pella , never mind . We 're too late . Let 's go . I can 't leave Nina . Nina , come with us . We can escape . - And how would I live ? - We have food . You don 't need the Hommiks . - Nor do I need Dorian . - Pella , come on ! - Dorian 's dead . - Then so are you . - Gunn Sar feeds me . Why should I leave ? - Because you are Seska . Nina , these people , they 're good . We can get off this planet . I don 't want to get off the planet . I don 't want to go anywhere . - Pella ! - Now please . I have my duties to attend to . I feel sorry for you , Nina . You were a Seska ... but more than that you were a great Seska . And now , I am a woman . I 'll take that . - It isn 't yours . - Nor is it yours . But it doesn 't matter whose it is . - Give it to me . - No . Then I 'm going to have to take it . I don 't want to hurt you , Avon . Oh , it 's good . - But it 's not good enough . - Don 't make me do it again . You must , though . Mustn 't you ? Oh , it hurts , Pella . But I will win . - There 's not much left , is there ? - Enough . You see , Pella , it 's your strength and however you use it , a man 's will always be greater . Unfair , perhaps , but biologically unavoidable . I 'm going now , Pella , before your friend Nina calls out the guard . - Is it done ? - Yes , she 's sleeping . - Any problems ? - No . Oh , except your prisoners escaped . - What ! - It 's all right . They won 't go far , I alerted security . Security . - The Seska 's name is Pella . - So ? - I remember her being born . - Hm . - She asked me to go with them . - Go where ? - Escape . - So , why didn 't you ? - How much further is it ? - 15 minutes . That 'll leave us an hour and a half . And I 'm tired already . - You didn 't need to come , Vila . - I didn 't need to stay . I get lonely , you know . Security alert . Intruders at A-F 43 . Approach and apprehend . Interesting . - How did you find this place ? - There had to be a computer room . - But it 's ... - Concealed ? Yes . But then I 've had a little experience in these things . Oh , by the way , I shouldn 't rely too heavily on your security . - It has ... weaknesses . - Gunn Sar ? Gunn Sar doesn 't know . But he doesn 't know a lot of things , does he ? - He is our leader . - And a very good one , if a little ... - Stupid ? - Well , I didn 't like to say it . He thinks we have scouts posted everywhere and runners . Impractical . So why do you keep up the illusion ? For the Hommiks . The people . If they see this , they 'll want more . Hydroponic food , machines , neutron blasters . And you don 't have them to give . - Because your civilisation died a long time ago . - Yes . - What killed it ? - A war . Everything was lost . Industry , people . Afterwards , the Council of Survivors decreed that we should start again from the very beginning . Wooden tools , flint arrowheads , the wheel . Ten thousand years ' advancement destroyed in a day . - And this ? - Overlooked . It 's self-maintained . Powered by our sun , it will last forever . This generation , even Gunn Sar , believes it to be some kind of magic that keeps the chambers light and warm . - A computer is like some ancient god to them . - What about the Seskas ? The Seskas ? Why do you ... Why ? PELLA : Yes , Avon , why ? I didn 't . Your finger was on the trigger . You killed him . I didn 't , Pella . But you did , didn 't you ? Yes , if you say so , Avon , I killed him . You are nothing more than a Hommik , Avon . - The guard have brought in some more intruders . - More ? What is this , an invasion ? Can 't I have a minute 's peace and recreation without intruders bursting in all the time ? Well , don 't just stand there . Bring them in , bring them in . MAN : Bring them in . - What do you want ? - VILA : A second chance ? - We 're from ... - I don 't care where you 're from . I am Gunn Sar , chief of the Hommiks and I 'm getting very weary of ... of ... - Nina , where 's Cato when I need him ? - I 'll bring him . I am Gunn Sar , chief of all the Hommiks , I rule by right of challenge . - And 26 lie dead ... - So I challenge you . What ? I challenge you . You rule by right of challenge . I challenge that rule . ( Gunn Sar laughing ) Not one of your better ideas , Dayna . - Do you accept my challenge ? - Don 't be foolish . - You 're ... Well , you 're a ... - A woman ? Yes . Take a good look . All right , woman , you just made a very big mistake . - Nina ! - Kate ! But you 're so ... You 've grown up . I thought you were dead . - What are you doing here ? - I 'm the wife of Gunn Sar . - Wife ? But you 're a Seska . - No , I 'm a woman . ( Bells ringing ) You must go , quickly . - Soon there will be Hommiks everywhere . - What is that ? What 's happening ? It 's a call to the arena . Someone has just been stupid enough to challenge my husband . Choose your weapon . ( Gunn Sar laughing ) Go on , Gunn Sar . Come on , Gunn Sar . ( Cheering ) - Kill her . - Come on , Gunn Sar . Get her . Get her , Gunn Sar . Get her ! Come on . Come on , kill her , Gunn Sar . ( Gunn Sar groaning ) - Kill her , Gunn Sar . - Move , Gunn Sar , move . - Finish her ! - Get her , Gunn Sar . - I thought you were dead . - I nearly was . Go on , Gunn Sar . Kill , Gunn Sar . Get in there , Gunn Sar . PELLA : The black woman must win . KATE : I know . Get up , Gunn Sar ! Kill her . Go on , Gunn Sar . Kill her . Come on , Gunn Sar . Come on , Gunn Sar . - Two Seskas and a woman against Gunn Sar ? - It is enough . Now . Don 't make a fuss , Dayna . Just walk and keep on walking . ( Sobbing ) Now the people shall leave this place , Gunn Sar . We shall seek a new home , far from here . A new way of life . Orac , in 16 minutes this base will be destroyed and you with it . Is there anything logically more important than trying to stop that happening ? Yes . The most logical course of action is to transport me to safety with all due urgency . - He 's grovelling ! - We 're not going anywhere , Orac , until you give me straight answers to two questions . One , how did the Seska woman get out of here ? And two , how does that method enable us to deactivate the nuclear compression charge ? Answers ; One , the woman made her exit via the secondary hatch . It was locked from the inside . The hatch was unlocked and locked again from the outside by telekinesis . Telekinesis ? The power to move objects at a distance using only the mind ... Yes , we know what it means . And yet you fail to see it as the only logical explanation and the means by which the manual override switch may be operated to cancel the nuclear compression charge . Now , will you kindly remove me to a place not closer than 742 metres from the launch chamber door . Orac , telekinesis doesn 't work , it 's a myth . The human brain doesn 't generate enough energy . The human brain does not need to generate energy . There is adequate energy elsewhere in the body . The brain merely directs it , given the in-grafted co-radiating crystal necessary to focus the beam . That 's a very clever machine . Pella ! - No need to ask how you got in . - Telekinesis . KATE : We apologise for startling you , but there isn 't much time . - 13 minutes . - Shall we go ? - Wait . Why should you care ? - Does it matter ? We care because the Scorpio is our only contact with civilisation . Without it , we become like the Hommiks . We need nutrients for our food process . Now let 's just be clear about this . The Scorpio is our ship . - 12 minutes ! - If that charge goes off , it won 't be anyone 's ship . In return for nutrients , we offer what we offered Dorian . Technical assistance . The Seska are specialists in tele-ergonomics and energy transference . - What , a teleport system of.003 % efficiency ? - Tarrant ! It 's a matter of time , that 's all . The teleport is difficult . - The Seska have worked on it for generations . - How many Seska are there ? - We are the Seska . - 11 minutes ! - Yes , but what about the others ? - There aren 't any others . Last week we were five . This morning , three . And now we are two . - 10 and 3 / 4 minutes ! - Let 's go . The lock is free . Nine and a half minutes . Just do your business with your tele-whatever . Have you ever seen a nuclear black hole go off ? It 's like a mini compression charge . Yes , I know I 'm prattling . It 's nerves . Nine and a quarter minutes . - Well , Orac ? - " Well " is not a question . Don 't play games . You know what I 'm asking . The answer is yes . With qualifications . - Then qualify . - The feat of calculation was prodigious . - The result imperfect . - Degree of imperfection ? Variably low . You will be required to perform circuit adjustments . Of course . Where ? - It 's safe . - Is that it ? Yes . - It doesn 't feel any different . - Try it . - You haven 't made any mistakes ? - No . Try it . Numerical Narcissus . - That 's it . - So why hasn 't it opened ? I don 't know . AVON : I do . Avon ! - Narcissus is not the code word . Orac made it up . - Why ? - Because that was my instruction . - You told Orac not to crack the code ? - Why do that ? - For much the same reason as Dorian . I didn 't like the idea of Scorpio taking off without me . - I 'm sorry to spoil your plan , Pella . - Be careful , Avon . I can very easily reset the detonator switch . - But you can 't change the timing . - What is all this about ? - Pella 's ambition to take Scorpio . - What makes you think that ? On the inside of the landing silo there 's a wheel that can be used - to crank open this door manually . - Standard safety precaution . Use the wheel to open the door and the nuclear compression charge won 't detonate . Unfortunately for Pella , her telekinesis was never powerful enough to turn that wheel and her technical expertise couldn 't develop a teleport system . - Oh , but she is developing ... - Quiet , Kate ! No , that 's what she told Dorian . That 's why he 's been feeding you . Dorian believed her , too . - What about Orac ? - Orac has been a little devious on my instruction . Ever since I discovered that Dorian 's last attempt at a teleport - was really a tele-ergotron . - What is a tele-ergotron ? The controlled direction of pure energy . In this case directed by Pella at the wheel inside the landing silo . You 've got a good brain , Avon ... so use it . Open the door . - What are you doing , Pella ? - Keep out of this , Kate . - That ship is mine . - Kill me and you 'll never get to it . Open the door , Avon . That 's an interesting choice of hostage . The door ! Stop it , Pella ! ( Kate screaming ) All right , Orac , where does the crystal go ? There is a cavity immediately behind the forward lens mechanism . - Will it work ? - There is a high probability . - But you 're not prepared to put a figure on it ? - No . - The launch doors are open . - Dayna , surveillance . Orac , the coordinates might change suddenly . - It is logical to assume so . - Launch thrusters are running . Tracking on . I 've got the countdown . 12 . 11 . 10 . - That 's Slave . - Nine . Orac made contact and has overridden the security program . Slave responds to anyone on the flight deck now . Four . Three . Two . One . DAYNA : Launched . - Still tracking , Orac ? - Of course . All right , Orac . Go . That always was the easy answer for the man . The Hommik ! If you didn 't want the answer , you shouldn 't have asked the question . - AVON : Xenon base , this is Scorpio . - We hear you , Avon . Everything 's under control . Why don 't you join me ? How ? - Just tell Orac what you want . - That hasn 't done us much good so far . It 's a problem , isn 't it ? You can have war between races , war between cultures , war between planets . But once you have war between the sexes , you eventually run out of people . SLAVE : It is beyond my humble capacity to offer an opinion , Master . Oh , that 's very good . You may turn out to be my kind of computer after all . I did not guarantee 100 % success . - Why is it always me ? - Seems fairly obvious from where I 'm standing . Vila , are you all right ? VILA : Yes , listen , what do you think about having an extra person around for a while , to sort of help out and so on ? - What do you think ? - I think Soolin just came out of hiding . Who are you talking about , Vila ? - He 's talking about me . - You want to join us , is that it ? Why ? - Why not ? Dorian 's dead . - You give your allegiance easily . I don 't give my allegiance at all . I sell my skill .

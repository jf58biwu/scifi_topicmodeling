 ( THEME MUSIC ) No , please . Please , no ! They tell me you haven 't been cooperating . No ? What 's the matter ? - Did I bleed on the wrong bit of floor ? - Good , good . - I 'm glad you 're pleased . - I hate to waste my time . - Don 't let me detain you . - I 'm a specialist , you see . - It 's written all over you . - I specialise in uncooperative prisoners . And you love a challenge . It 's good that we understand each other . Your name wouldn 't be Shrinker , by any chance , would it ? You 've heard of me ? I knew if I held out , you would show up eventually . It says more for your nerve than your brain . You think so ? Long before I 've finished with you , you 'll be begging for death . Don 't worry , it 's sending all right . - What are you talking about ? - The implant in your neck . I don 't know what you 're talking ... There is a homing device implanted in your neck . - How did you know ? - We detected it as we picked you up . We 've been monitoring it ever since . It 's been sending steadily for five days . Five days ? - Is that how long I 've been here ? - Your friends aren 't coming . They are . They must . An attack on this place would be suicide anyway . Is there anyone ... who thinks that you 're worth dying for ? - Not anymore , not since Anna . - Anna ? Dead . Anna ... is dead . Do you know what this is ? - It 's a laser probe . - It 's a laser probe . We 're tired of waiting for your friends to come ... so we 've decided to go to them . You are going to tell me who they are and where they are . I can 't . Please , I can 't . I 'm going to start by burning out your eyes . Please . You 'll start by telling me your name . Now that 's not too difficult , is it ? Who are you ? - Avon . My name is Avon . - Avon ? And you misunderstand about the homing device . My friends won 't come while it 's sending . But now I 've switched it off . - And we 're here . - Still . Stand very , very still . - How did you get in here ? - It 's called a teleport . - You 're Blake 's people . - That 's right . That 's why I couldn 't tell your interrogators my name . What is your name ? You look terrible , Avon . - What have they been doing to you ? - No ! Don 't kill him . I waited for him . - He 's mine . - No ! Guards ! Bracelets . Sorry we took so long . Two-minute alert is difficult to sustain over five days . I thought he 'd never show up . Then I thought , you won 't . Well , now everyone 's showing up . Get a move on . Ready ? Go . ( SUSPENSEFUL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) - You look terrible . - So I 've been told . - I thought you might need this . - Thanks . So you 're Shrinker . - He doesn 't look like much . - It depends on what you paid to get him . - He cost me enough . - Was it worth it ? - I 'll let you know . - What are you going to do with me ? - He 's going to kill you . - Why me ? I haven 't done anything . I 've only ... Don 't tell me . Let me guess . You 've only ever followed orders . - It 's true . - I believe you . Stand there . - Is everything ready ? - Just as you said . I set it all up myself . - Are you sure you want to go on with it ? - Yes , I 'm sure . Cally , I know you don 't want any part of this . I won 't give you any part of it . You 're out . This is mine . I 'm doing it . And what am I doing , Avon ? Just following orders , like him ? - She 's right . It 'd be murder . - You should know if anyone does . I 'm going to get cleaned up . - Will you entertain my guest ? - It 'll be a pleasure . Why ? I don 't even ... I never saw him before . What have I ever done to him ? You killed someone he loved . And there aren 't many of them about . Avon 's not a very lovable man . Who was it ? Did they give you names when they gave you your orders ? Even if they did , could you put a face to the name ? One screaming face among so many screaming faces ? Did they beg , Shrinker ? Did they plead ? " No , Shrinker . Please , Shrinker " ? Can you remember how they cried , what they cried ? Can you separate the voices now ? Or is it just one long satisfying scream ? Stop it . All of you . Leave him alone . - He 's an animal , Cally . - Yes , and it 's contagious , isn 't it ? Get over there and sit down . What do you suppose went wrong down there ? Took longer to trap him than we expected . No , I didn 't mean the plan . I meant the whole thing . What happened to the rebellion ? Why is the Earth still controlled by creatures like him ? ( TENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) A question of leadership . The rabble which sought to challenge ... the established order lacked our inspiration , our unity ... our leadership , they are crushed . Earth and the Inner Planets are once again united . Gentlemen , I give you a toast . Our inspiration , our unity , our leader ... President Servalan . - What do you think ? - I think it 's crude and obvious . - Thank you , Sula . - You asked what I thought . Stupid of me . I should know better by now . If it 's any consolation to you , I 'm sure Servalan will be delighted . She is , after all , a tasteless megalomaniac . - I think it 's rather fine . - You would , Chesku . - Her presidential palace . - A grotesque anachronism , like its owner . We could have built two cities for what it cost to reconstruct that absurdity . You keep talking like that , you 'll get us both killed . ( FOOTSTEPS ) Yes ? What do you men want ? I 'm afraid they want your security pass and your clothes . The rabble aren 't quite as crushed as your speech suggests . Sula , is this some kind of a joke ? No , Chesku . This is no kind of a joke . I don 't understand . You 're my wife . That 's all over now . ( TENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) Get him out of sight . Maybe we should have stopped them , sir . - Stopped them ? - Councillor Chesku and his wife . Maybe we should 've stopped them leaving the surveillance zone . - We are supposed to watch everyone . - That is the meaning of surveillance , yes . Have you been studying in your spare time , Forres ? Sir ? You think we should have stopped them ? It is standard procedure . For a member of the High Council there 's no standard procedure . - The book says ... - Never mind the book , Section Leader . All you have to worry about is what I say , right ? - Absolutely , sir . - Absolutely , Section Leader . And what I say is that if a High Councillor wishes to ... swing stark naked through the trees ... and spit on the surveillance scanners ... then swinging through the trees and spitting on scanners ... becomes standard procedure , at least for him . - Or his wife . - Now there 's a thought . Not one to dwell on , given your present rank . One law for the rich , eh , Major ? There 's no law for the rich , Forres ... and even less for the rich , personal friends of the President . - They are only civilians , though . - Do you want to join them ? Sorry , sir . If you want to get on in this man 's army , Forres ... you 've got to learn to distinguish between civilians who are ... - and civilians who aren 't . - Sir . Are and aren 't what , sir ? When you know that , you 'll be ready for promotion . I don 't know that I 'd want it . Promotion , I mean . You done the routine sweeps ? - All is smooth and sweatless . - What ? Full sweep is negative , all systems , sir . ( BEEP ) Surveillance is clear . ( BEEP ) - Function is normal , sir . - Better . Some days are better than others , sir . They say that where I come from , sir . Loudly , I imagine , on the day you left . My mother cried when I left . Thought she 'd never see me again . - Cries easily , your mother , does she ? - Not really , sir . But I owed her money , you see . It 's true , may I never leave this spot . That can be arranged , Section Leader . - The teleport coordinates set ? - All set . - Need any help ? - I 'll manage . On your feet . - No . - I 'm tired and I hurt . It would be easier to kill you here and now . On your feet . Avon . - Thanks . - Concentrate . - He 's more dangerous than he looks . - Isn 't everybody ? You 've got him on his feet . Can you stay on yours ? I 'm touched by your concern . My concern is that I don 't find myself on the wrong end of your gun ... - with him on the right end of it . - Don 't worry . You won 't . Put us down . ( SUSPENSEFUL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) - Where are we ? - The bracelet . - What is this place ? - It 's a cave . If you 're thinking of running , don 't . There 's nowhere to go . The only way out is the way we came in . You 're really going to do it , then ? In cold blood ? Executions are always in cold blood . Executions , I see , so that 's it , is it ? - Execution ? Justice ? - You tell me . Who is she ? - Who are you ? - ( AVON ) Isn 't it a bit late to ask that ? Why do I never know what you 're thinking , Avon ? I could never say it . - Not even to me ? - Especially not to you . I never saw her before in my life . I 'm telling you the truth . I don 't know who she is . - Anna Grant . Her name was Anna Grant . - It means nothing . - ( STUTTERING ) You 've got to believe me . - I do . It 's been several years . You must have killed hundreds since you tortured her to death . All right , yes . I 've killed hundreds ... and remembered them all , all of them , every last whining traitor . There wasn 't one that died without telling me what I wanted to know . - Not one . - Professional pride ? - Lf you like . - Not much , no . I never saw your woman . You were looking for me . She knew where I was . This man you 're buying the exit visas from ... do you trust him ? - Trust him ? Of course I don 't trust him . - Well , then ? Trust is only dangerous when you have to rely on it . That 's very profound , my love . As long as I know I can 't trust him , there 's no problem . Do you trust anyone ? Do you trust me ? Oh , yes . I 'm afraid I do . Why were we looking for you ? You hadn 't joined up with Blake . Not then . Not here on Earth . I 'd found my way around the banking computers ' security programs . I was about to undermine confidence in the entire Federation credit system . Anna and I were going to be so rich that no one could touch us . - And we were almost there . - You were never even close . I remember you now , you 're Kerr Avon ... the great bank fraud . - That 's what I just said . - Bartolomew was running you . Running me ? Central Security , he was their best agent . They were on to you from the start . They were convinced you were political ... so Bartolomew stayed close and let you run . Anyone that you so much as looked at was marked for collection . - You expect me to believe that ? - You dropped out of sight ... after you killed the man who was supplying you with exit visas . I 'm right , aren 't I ? I was shot . I was stupid enough to let him fire first . Once Bartolomew lost sight of you , all your contacts were pulled in . So , you remember her now . No . That 's just the point . I never saw any of them . It was Bartolomew , he was in control . I didn 't kill her . Bartolomew did . ( STATIC BUZZING ) - Well ? - Everything 's out in that section , sir . Visual , audio , electromagnetic , they 're all out . Breakdown or sabotage ? - What is it , Forres ? - I 'm not sure , sir . Being sure is what you 're paid for . Would you rather be back on foot patrol ? Breakdown . I 'd say it was a breakdown , sir . All the equipment hasn 't been fully tested yet . Why sabotage a small section like that , anyway ? - Guard Commander . - Maj. Grenlee here . - Yes , Major ? - Get a squad out to section ... - 6-1 - Delta-0 . - 6-1 - Delta-0 . We have a surveillance malfunction . I want to know why . - Right , sir . - And Guard Commander ? - At the double and alert . - Naturally , sir . " Naturally , sir . " I only wish it was . Are all the others clear ? All functioning normally . It 's just that one . - Shall I seal the perimeter ? - No . - Standard operating procedure , sir . - I don 't give a damn if it 's Holy Writ . You don 't seal the perimeter on the day ... the President 's giving her first official reception in her new residence . Unless you want to explain to her that the guests couldn 't get through ... because we had a faulty microcircuit . There are worse things than foot patrol , sir . There are indeed , Section Leader . And if we interfere with that reception ... we 'll get to know most of them , intimately . Excellent . My other guests will be arriving in about four hours . I trust everything will be ready for them ? My compliments to Councillor Chesku . Ask him to check the seating arrangements ... in the banqueting hall before our meeting . Surveillance . Maj. Grenlee . I take it surveillance and security have been fully briefed ... on the guests I 'm expecting , Major . Yes , ma 'am . Everyone 's fully briefed . - Any problems ? - No , ma 'am . Everything 's normal . No problems , ma 'am . Good . Keep it that way , Major . Where the hell is that squad ? ( TENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) When you 've stripped them , make sure the bodies are well hidden . Balon . You know what to do . We can 't wait any longer . We must seal the perimeter . It 's taking too long . Something has happened to that squad . All right . Status One alarm . Seal the perimeter . Surveillance , do you read me ? Surveillance , do you read me ? We read you . What happened ? You aren 't going to believe this . It was building a nest in the microwave transmitter . That 's why nothing got through to us . I told you that was the weak point in the system . All right , Forres . Well done . You and your men can get back now . Right , sir , but with your permission ... we 'd like to make a quick sweep beyond the perimeter ... - now that we 're here . - Very well . Out . - Section Leader Forres ? - Sir ? If you ever panic like that again ... I 'll see you are busted so far down you 'll be saluting civilians . Sir . ( TENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) Well done , Balon . Get some rest . We start the second phase in two hours . I 've told you over and over again . Why won 't you believe me ? All right Let us assume that I do believe you . - Who is Bartolomew ? Where is he ? - What 's in it for me ? - A way out . - I don 't trust you . - Your problem . - Why trust you ? I 've got the gun . - Bartolomew was just a code name . - Yes ? Well , I 'm not sure who he was . - End of conversation . - No , wait . Don 't shoot . Bartolomew was Central Security 's top agent . - So you said . - No one knew who he was . No one was safe from him . He was free to hunt anyone in or out of the service . He could watch you , and if he didn 't like what he saw ... Paranoia is the occupational hazard of the torturer . - Bartolomew was real . - Was real ? One of the first targets of the Rebellion was Central Security . Their mistake was their obsession with revenge . When they finished kicking the corpses , they 'd lost their chance . The President had regrouped her forces . You 're saying Bartolomew was one of the corpses they were kicking ? No , I don 't think so , if I escaped , why shouldn 't he ? You 're wasting my time , Shrinker . - Ifs are no use to me or to you , either . - No , wait , please . - I 've got a name . - A name ? I had to question a controller from Central ... when I was with the rebels ... So that 's how you escaped . When the rebels lost , you changed sides yet again . No one could accuse you of being doctrinaire , could they ? - Why didn 't the controller recognise you ? - Why should he ? The elite from Central didn 't mix with the interrogation division . Their fastidiousness did them credit . - Somebody 's got to do the lousy jobs . - Life is cruel , isn 't it ? Spare me the rationalisations . Just give me the name . Councillor Chesku . The controller told you that that was who Bartolomew was ? - Not exactly . - What exactly ? I 'd finished questioning him , he was dying ... and suddenly I got curious ... so I hit him with one last order , " Identify Bartolomew " . And he said , " Councillor Chesku is still " ... and then he died . - Chesku . - He 's one of Servalan 's closest advisors . She 'd know the answer , why don 't you ask her ? I might just do that . - Are you ready to bring me up ? - Ready when you are . - Stand by . - We had a deal . - Did we ? - A way out . You promised me . And I 'm a man of my word . In the end , that 's all there is , really . - What 's that for ? - That 's your way out . It 's a better deal than you gave any of your victims . - Bring me up . - No , we had a deal . That isn 't what I meant . That isn 't fair . It isn 't fair ! ( UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) - You took your time . - It was necessary . - Is it done ? - Yes , but it isn 't finished . Wonderful . Who 's next on your list ? Servalan ? - Orac . - What is it now ? Gracious as ever . Orac , I want you to interrogate ... the Federation Security computers and get me Servalan 's location . I was joking , Avon . Then I want your best strategy for reaching her . You wish to communicate with her . Face to face with a gun in my hand . And a hole in your head . Have you gone mad ? Possibly . How long , Orac ? I will inform you when I have the necessary data . - Good . - Don 't we get a say in this ? - By all means . Say away . Orac . - Yes ? Check on a Councillor Chesku at the same time . I want to know where he is , too . It is the duty of surveillance to keep track of everyone . Councillor Chesku and his wife left the perimeter some time ago , ma 'am . - They were taking the air . - They were taking the air . You let them leave . We had no authority to stop them ... But they were accompanied . Two troopers were following them , at a discreet distance , of course . Find them . Bring them here . Convey my compliments to the Councillor ... and assure him that I am certain he has an excellent reason ... for keeping his president waiting . Yes , ma 'am . Some days are better than others . Thank the stars that squad is still out there . I hope the Councillor 's wearing fireproof underwear . If I were him I think I 'd keep on going . ( BEEPING ) Squad Leader , this is surveillance , do you copy ? Come on , man , come on . - Are they still out there ? - Absolutely , sir . They haven 't come back across the perimeter . I 'll have that Guard Commander on a charge . If his men were any slacker you 'd have to pour them into uniform . Squad Leader , this is surveillance , do you copy ? Squad Leader , come in , please . Surveillance , this is Squad Leader . Have you seen Councillor Chesku and his wife ? Yes , sir . We passed them about ten minutes ago . Get back to them and remind the Councillor ... that he 's late for a meeting with the President . You might tell him that she 's not exactly overjoyed about it . - Right , sir . - At the double , Squad Leader . Out . Perfect . Get to your positions . And good luck . ( TENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) All right . Let 's go . Here they come . ( BEEPING ) - ( SERVALAN ) Yes ? - Councillor Chesku 's on his way , ma 'am . - Very well . - I 'll say he is . Look , he 's starting to run . - Go on , Councillor . - Yeah , it 's a race . Come on , Councillor , you can do better than that . If it wasn 't free , you 'd pay to see it , wouldn 't you ? Look at him go . Dignity , Councillor , at all costs , dignity . My money 's on the woman . Look at that movement . I had a feeling she 'd be athletic . Every part , a moving part . Yes , all right , Forres . Back to work while you can still see . - Sir . - What is it ? We 're under attack ! ( ALARM SOUNDING ) ( DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) ( ALARM STOPS ) Forres . Some days are better than others , Section Leader . Break it down . ( BANGING ON DOOR ) I take it these creatures belong to you . ( GASPING ) That 's right , Madame President . And they want you to resign . You can tell Avon the new orbit is now confirmed and steady . - Green on all systems . - Right . You heard that ? Are you really going through with it ? - I made a promise . - To Anna ? - To me . - So what are you going to do ? Stick a gun in Servalan 's ear and say ... give me Bartolomew or I 'll blow the top of your head off ? - Something like that . - And if she doesn 't ? I 'll blow the top of her head off . - Yes , I believe you would . - So will she . Orac , have you got it yet ? An examination of the plans contained in the main security computers ... indicates that there is no safe place ... to teleport within that defence perimeter . Outside it then ? To cross it undetected would be impossible . I 'll take your best option within the perimeter . Very well . I will set the teleport coordinates . I would , however , strongly advise waiting until dusk . Why not full dark ? Despite all efforts to eliminate this weakness ... dusk and dawn remain the human being 's most vulnerable times . Therefore , insofar as the security system contains human components ... All right , we get the picture . ... it will be at its least efficient at these times . You know Orac 's main drawback ? He 's too useful to destroy . Irritating , isn 't it ? ( SOMBRE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) - She 's useful . - The men want her killed . - Really ? - Yes , really . - The men want her killed now . - I 'm not deaf , Hob . Just not listening , is that it ? I 'm not fighting my own men to protect Servalan . Or anyone else , for that matter . - Do you understand me , Sula ? - Perfectly . - You see , I know which side I 'm on . - Meaning what , exactly ? Meaning I 've never been a member of the senior echelon . I have no problem understanding how the men feel . - I 've never eaten at Servalan 's table . - I wouldn 't let that bother you . I 'm sure your exception from the guest list ... was an oversight rather than a deliberate insult . - Don 't patronise me , Sula . - Then stop talking like a fool . Do you seriously imagine I have any personal regard for that woman ? I might hate her more than any of you ... precisely because I do know her . So let 's cut her throat and be done with it . She is more use to us alive . - The men don 't think so . - The men don 't think at all . Maybe not , but they do fight and they do die . That isn 't something that 's new to them . Now you 're patronising me . We didn 't fight to put you behind that desk , Sula . It was my planning that got us here , Hob . Without me , you and your men would still be skulking around the wastelands . You seem to have forgotten that rather quickly . Did you expect gratitude ? I expected to be listened to . - Sula , we 've won . - Not yet ! Servalan is the Federation . Kill her and it 's over . You 're not really that naive , are you ? I 'm speaking for the others . It 's what they believe . And you ? What do you believe ? I believe we 're lost unless we stick together . If killing Servalan is what it takes , then she 's more use dead . Alive , Servalan can order her forces to disarm . Alive , Servalan can announce that ... she 's standing down in favour of the People 's Council ... which you and the others will lead . Alive , Servalan can hand over power . Dead , she 's just one more corpse . - Haven 't we got enough of those ? - We 're clearing them away now . That 's not what I meant . You think she 'll actually do all that ? - I think she could be persuaded . - How ? I imagine that between us , we could think of a way . - You 'd have to persuade the men , first . - Will you back me ? - Yes . You 've been right so far . - Good . Get the men together . We 'll talk to them . - Where ? - In the banqueting hall . All right . An appropriate place to whet the appetite of the People 's Council . Get a move on with that . Sula wants to talk to us about the next phase . This is Maj. Grenlee ... on emergency band seven . Residence One to Command HQ . Do you copy ? We need help . Do you copy ? ( EERIE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) Bartolomew was running you . Anyone you so much as looked at was marked . Bartolomew stayed close ... let you run . No , please . Please , no ! ( FOOTSTEPS ) ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) The optimum time for teleport ... will be in precisely one minute and 43 seconds . - Let 's get on with it , then . - I 'll operate the teleport . A visit to Servalan appeals to me less than going bald ... or breaking both legs . - I 'm going down alone . - Not this time . - This has nothing to do with you . - That 's true . On the other hand , you are something to do with us . We 've talked about it and discovered we care what happens to you . Within reason , of course . - We 're as surprised about it as you are . - Not to mention embarrassed . - I stand a better chance alone . - No , you don 't . - Are you coming ? - We 'll try not to get in your way . What 's the matter , Avon ? Are you afraid of witnesses ? If you are going at all , now is the optimum time . Put us down . ( SUSPENSEFUL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) Avon ! He 's been shot . Not too long ago . Probably forgot to salute . - Vila . - Yes ? Get after him . Vila . - Still here . - Make sure you stay that way . - I think we 've walked into a revolt . - You 're among friends , then . Avon may not see it that way . Stay awake . - Of course . - And sober . That was uncalled for . I only drink to be sociable . Cheers , Orac . Hey ! ( YELLING ) ( REBELS YELLING ) ( HOB ) Listen ! Sula 's right . Servalan 's main forces don 't even know we 're here . Why throw away an advantage like that ? ( SULA ) You have to make up your minds . Do you want victory , or do you want revenge ? - We want both ! - Yes ! Hey , wake up . Where is Servalan ? - Where is Servalan ? - Easy , man , you 'll kill him . - ( GROANING ) I don 't ... - Major . Major , where are they holding the President ? - I think below ... - lf we help you , can you show us where ? Yes , Major , you 're dying , but that 's what you 're paid for . Now the President 's life is at stake . Can you take us to her ? - I 'll try . - Good man . - Take his other arm , Section Leader . - Yes , sir . ( DOOR CREAKING ) Gently , Major . - Be all right , in a minute . - Take your time . But not too much of it . Odd feeling . Place feels old . Do you suppose this part 's original ? Genuinely pre-atomic ? - Possibly . Does it matter ? - Obviously not . Avon , it 's all right , Major , I 've got you . - Avon , you really are a prize ... - Yes , I really am . So shut up and let me do what I came to do . I might have known you were behind all this . - You flatter me . - Go to hell , Avon . Probably . But I 'd like some information first . In exchange for what ? - A quick death ? - That is the reward for silence . I 've had worse offers . Tell me what I want to know , and I 'll get you out of here . Yes ? What 's the matter with you , Servalan ? I 'm offering to set you free . You 're offering to let her go . That 's not the same . What are you talking about ? I 'm talking about the President of the Terran Federation ... Ruler of the High Council , Lord of the Inner and Outer Worlds ... High Admiral of the Galactic Fleets , Lord General of the Six Armies ... - and Defender of the Earth . - Get to the point . The point is that a few dozen guerrillas walked in ... killed her guards , beat her up and chained her up . You want to set her free ? - Convince her that it didn 't happen . - She 's been a prisoner before . But in her own palace , on Earth ... in what should be the centre of her power ? Is that it ? Have you finally lost your nerve ? Have you murdered your way to the wall of an underground room ? It 's an old wall , Avon , it waits . I hope you don 't die before you reach it . Then we 're agreed ? Then bring Servalan to me . You 'll see . She 'll do everything we say , and that , my friends , is real revenge . ( REBELS CHEERING ) Why should I tell you anything ? What can you threaten me with ? I spent some time with your interrogators . It 's too late for that , Avon . Your dead major might have given the alarm . Help could be on the way . Don 't you want to be alive when they get here ? And unchained ? Who is Bartolomew ? - Why ? - Tell me who . Tell me why . He killed someone . A girl . - Anna Grant . - Anna ? Release me . I 'll tell you anything you want to know . That 's far enough . Don 't . Hello , Anna . Avon . Avon ! I was afraid they 'd kill you . I heard there was someone with Blake , but I wasn 't sure ... and I didn 't dare let myself hope . Why didn 't you come back for me ? What 's the matter ? I didn 't come back because you were dead . Well , as you can see , I 'm not . - As I can see . - You don 't seem very pleased about it . Course , it 's been a long time ... I suppose there 's someone else , is that it ? - Is there someone else , Avon ? - No , there 's no one else . What then ? What 's wrong ? Why won 't you touch me ? Perhaps because I can 't believe it 's you . - Have I changed so much ? - I don 't know . Have you , Anna ? Not the way I feel for you . Nothing 's changed since you left me . There hasn 't been one moment when I wasn 't alone . I want you to know that . You must see that . Avon , look at me . Look at me . Anyone you so much as looked at was marked for collection . How did you get away , Anna , that last day ... the day I got myself shot ? How did you get away ? I waited for you , and when you didn 't come back , I ran . Bartolomew was running you . Where to ? Where did you run to , Anna ? Not to your brother . He thinks you 're dead . - Who hid you , Anna ? - My husband . I didn 't love him , he knew that . There was only you . But he wanted me and I was afraid . Bartolomew stayed close and let you run . Close and let you run . Close and let you run . He wasn 't Bartolomew , was he ? No , he wasn 't . Not even Chesku knew who Bartolomew was . But you do , don 't you , Avon ? ( CALLY ) Avon ! At least that was honest . I knew when you found out , you would kill me . Unless you killed me first . - We were well matched , Avon . - You weren 't even real . Bartolomew , Central Security 's best agent ... - one of your colleagues told me that . - Anna Grant . I was only ever Anna Grant with you . Of all the things I have known myself to be ... I never recognised the fool . It wasn 't all lies . I let you go ... my love . No , you never let me go . You never did . Can you convince yourself that that didn 't happen , Avon ? Attention in the house . You are surrounded . Throw down your weapons and come out . - Stand by , Vila . - You are surrounded . Throw down your weapons and come out . ( ALARM SOUNDING ) Are you ready to come up ? Is that what you said ? - Looks as if he did get through . - Avon , we 've got to get out of here . - Time to leave . - Vila . - Vila , can you hear me ? - Teleporting now . You idiot , Vila ! What do you mean ? That was a very fast pickup . - Where 's Avon ? - Put me back down . - Outside the house like before . - Put me back where you took us from . I can 't . The output coordinates are still set . Didn 't you check the input coordinates as we came up ? - I forgot . - He forgot . - Well , put me down outside the house . - Don 't be stupid , Dayna . It 'll be crawling with Federation troops by now . This 'll take at least two minutes to calculate . Avon . You really think I care ? - Put the bracelet on . - Why ? Just do it . I 'm going to send your friends a corpse . Tell them to bring you up . Liberator . Bring me up . Sula . Servalan was planning on sending you a corpse . Corpse reviver ? But , the rumours of my death ... Have been greatly exaggerated . Well ... slightly exaggerated , anyway . ( THEME MUSIC )

 MIKE : Don 't you keep this stuff locked up ? I mean , how did they get through your security system ? They had an access card . Listen , Doctor , one man is dead , and the fanatic who killed him has the means to make an atomic bomb . I had no choice . You don 't seem to understand . These guys are neo-Nazis . This is what happens when you mix with a lower race . Half-breed ! He 's going to make a run for it . Make me a martyr ! Excuse me , Bill . I seemed to have locked myself out of my office again . ( SIGHS ) You fellas amaze me . Must be a good dozen of you eggheads around here messing with God knows what , and not a one of you can wipe his own nose . ( CARD READER BEEPS ) What in hell ? ( ALARM SOUNDING ) Let 's move it ! Hey , wait a minute ! ( GUN FIRES ) Degenerate punk ! Let 's go ! ( MIKE AND SAINT JOHN TRASH-TALKING ) ( INAUDIBLE ) ( TRASH TALK CONTINUES ) If you boys can 't play quietly , I 'm going to have to call your mother . The king ! ( EXCLAIMS ) It 's not my fault he 's such a sore loser . Sore winner . MIKE : Oh , we 'll see . Yeah ... BOTH : The ball ! Just knock it off , okay ? Mmm-hmm . Ah , your dad . When was that taken ? Just before the end of the war . England , I think . Yeah , Tony was quite the ace . He was an ace , all right . Aw , come on , Jo . After all , he is your dad . When it 's convenient . He blows in and out of my life like a hurricane . Oh , it won 't be so bad . What 's it been since his last visit , five years ? Eight . Last time I saw him was at my graduation ceremonies , when he tried to bribe the dean into making me valedictorian . Sounds like my kind of guy . Yeah , he is . ( AIRPLANE FLYING OVERHEAD ) That 's some flying . Tony , I presume . He was always a show-off . Joey ! There 's my girl ! How the hell are you ? ( LAUGHS ) My God , you are the picture of your mother . Good to see you , Tony . That was some flying , Tony . Thanks . This is Mike Rivers and you remember Saint John . We all work together . I met you once before when Dom took you and your big brother fishing up in Montana back in ' 54 , ' 55 . You wouldn 't remember . Well , then it 's nice to see you again , then . Well , little girl , how about rustling up some grub for the old man before he keels over ? Great , uh , we 'll figure something out . '54 or ' 55 ? I was a baby . I was ... Really , it was so those Messerschmitts just turned tail and ran . You let them get away after a stand like that ? We were just kids in the war by then . It was all that was left of Hitler 's precious Luftwaffe . Besides , we were out of ammunition . ( LAUGHING ) Jo , get the old man another cup of coffee , will you ? Yeah , get me another one while you 're at it , will you , Joey ? But , of course , being a man of the ' 80s , I 'm perfectly capable of getting a cup of coffee for myself . Thanks . She 's got him pretty well trained . They 'd make a good pair . Uh , no comment , Tony . You got nothing to say ? ( PHONE RINGING ) Actually , the , uh , less said about that , the better , Tony . Santini Air . Oh , yeah , Jason . Okay , we 'll be right there . I think I understand . Oh , good . ( LAUGHING ) Have some more pizza , Tony . Saint John ! Huh ? What 's up ? Ah , that was Jason . We gotta go . You need me ? No , that 's okay . Uh , nice meeting you , Tony . Are you sure ? No , it 's okay . Tony , we 'll catch you later . Okay . So , how long you here for ? Just long enough to drive you crazy . About another 10 minutes , I guess . Oh , Dad . I don 't know what I 'm supposed to do . I haven 't seen you in years , and you just fly in out of the blue . Well , you know me . I wish I did . Oh , don 't worry . This is the last time I 'll drop in on you on short notice . ( SIGHS ) You drive me crazy , you know ? I 'm glad to see you . MIKE : So , how much did they take ? Two kilos . I 'm checking with Company intelligence for anyone shopping for plutonium on the black market . We 've got to get it back , fast . Anyone on it yet ? Not yet . The Atomic Energy Commission contacted The Company first . We got 24 hours before the news leaks out . Well , so where do we start ? My guess 'd be the scene of the crime . Right . I don 't see how you could catch them by now . Let us worry about that . Did anyone even get a close look at them ? Our only witness is dead . Don 't you keep this stuff locked up ? I mean , how did they get through your security system ? They had an access card . Wonderful . This is beginning to look like an inside job . That 's impossible . Yeah , so is stealing two kilos of high-grade plutonium . Where are the videotapes ? We can view them in my office . LONGFELLOW : This is all we have . The guard didn 't see them until it was too late . Sounds convenient . What about the van ? Was it rad-proofed ? Absolutely . Lead-lined throughout . Let 's hope so . Makes you wonder who 's minding the store , doesn 't it ? No kidding . The AEC 's going to shut that place down even if we do find ... Hang on . I 'm reading high lead content traveling 70 about 23 miles southeast of here . That 's either a very slow bullet or a very hot van . That 's it . I 'm only reading one body . He must be flying solo . Let 's pull him over . He 's heading toward the river . This could get complicated . Let 's give him a detour . MIKE : Make sure you don 't hit him . SAINT JOHN : I 'll try and get him to stop . Oh , God , no ! Whoa . At least it didn 't come apart . Just because the radiation scanners didn 't pick up anything doesn 't mean those canisters aren 't split wide open inside . Yeah , we 'd better stay clear till Jo gets here with the radiation suits . So , what 's this all about ? It 's a government contract . The guys just need some gear . Uh-huh . I figured Dom was into something foolish like that . You inherited the whole ball of wax , huh ? Well , Uncle Dom was always there for me . And I wasn 't , is that it ? I didn 't say that . You know , I 'd have made it to the funeral if I 'd heard about it . How was I supposed to find you ? Did you try ? Oh , well , can 't do anything about it now , I guess . You better take this up if you want to keep up that speed . Come on , Tony . I 've flown more choppers than you have . The old man doesn 't know anything , huh ? All right , I 'll shut up . ( SIGHS ) ( CHUCKLING ) I 'm sorry . Your mother always told me I talk too much . ( CHUCKLING ) Remember when I told her I was going to fly ? Hmm . She said I 'd be a lot safer in the air than with you on the road . ( LAUGHING ) She was a hell of a woman , your mother . I still miss her . What 's the situation ? Well , we can 't be sure till we get down there . It could be hot . There 's plutonium in that van down there . You mean it 's radioactive ? Yeah . You and Jo stay here . Okay . You reading anything ? Not a trace . It looks good . SAINT JOHN : The cylinders must still be intact . Yeah , it 's clean . It 's empty . MIKE : They must have made a switch . Yeah , but why risk opening the containers ? It 's suicide . ( GEIGER COUNTER CLICKING ) Hey , that damn thing must be on the fritz . No , I checked it myself . What is it , Tony ? Well , how the hell should I know ? Hey , Tony , this is one of the most sensitive Geiger counters made . It 's reading more than your magnetic personality . Well , I 've had some radiation treatments lately , but I 'm all done with that now . What are you saying ? ( SIGHS ) I have cancer . Why didn 't you tell me ? Because it 's none of your damn business ! It 's none of my business ? Hey , Tony , what can I say ? Oh , hell , there 's nothing to say . What about those treatments ? Well , there 's no point . Those doctors don 't know zip . So you 're just giving up ? You were never a quitter . Well , I 've never been dying before . We 're going to make another sweep of the area to find radiation traces . Yeah , good luck , fellas . You 've got to see a doctor . Joey , I 've already seen the doctor . And the specialist , and the therapist , and the scare-apist , and there 's nothing more that they can do . Are you sure those government stiffs didn 't suspect anything ? No . They 're off looking for the van , just like you planned . Look , I 've done everything you 've asked . As soon as Brooke ditches the van , he 'll call in . When I hear from him , you 'll hear from me . What do you mean ? SAINT JOHN : I 'm not reading a thing . How are you doing ? MIKE : I keep looking at these security tapes . Yeah , there 's something that 's just ... Hey , wait a minute . That 's it . What 's it ? Well , the plutonium never left the place . Watch your monitor , I 'll patch it through . MIKE : Look at the canisters . Tops are on the right . Now watch this . SAINT JOHN : Tops are on the left . They pulled a switch ! Give that man a cigar . Longfellow 's got some explaining to do . MIKE : Yep . Come in , Airwolf . We were just about to call in . We 've got some news . So do I. What have we got ? A group of gunrunners have a deal to trade hardware for a batch of plutonium . I 've already got a fix on them . Nice work . It looks like Longfellow 's the inside man . He sent us on some goose chase . Look , we 're heading back for Triad right now . Who 's the buyer ? This is where it gets ugly . The National Association for Racial Purity . You mean we 're dealing with ... Neo-Nazis . There . Clean that up , have a good fight with a wire brush , it 'll be good as new . How long have you known ? You got a tobacco tin around here someplace ? Tony , will you talk to me ? I haven 't got anything to say . Well , I do . You can 't do this to me . To you ? I 'm the one with the cancer . That 's a hell of an attitude . You 've done that to me all my life . You just shut me out . You weren 't meant to know . Well , now I do . What 's the story , Tony ? One doctor gave me six months . One doctor gave me four . I liked the first one better . ( WHIMPERS ) ( SIGHS ) Well , I made you cry again . I always make you cry , don 't I ? Shut up . Hey , listen , Longfellow , there 's no trace of radiation in any of those canisters . Where 's the plutonium ? I don 't know . And even if I did , I couldn 't tell you . Listen , Doctor , one man is dead , and the fanatic who killed him has the means to make an atomic bomb . I had no choice . You don 't seem to understand . These guys are neo-Nazis . Oh , my God . They have my family . Saint John 's all wired in . All we can do now is wait for the call . I 'm ready to target them as soon as you make contact . I should have realized my family was vulnerable to something like this . You hear about these things happening , but you never think ... We 've got to get the plutonium back . Then we can make a move to get your family out . Now , when Sullivan calls , you 're going to have to play it straight . I 'm feeling so rattled right now , I don 't think I can do it . You have to . ( PHONE RINGING ) Longfellow . Hello , Doc . I haven 't heard from my partner . Where is he ? I don 't know . They fell for your plan . No one has any idea where the plutonium is . Then you 'd just better keep it that way . I want to speak to my wife . I have to know they 're still alive . She 's alive . She 'll stay that way as long as you hold up your end . I want to speak to her . Edward ! Did you get that , Jason ? Got it ! Any luck on the trace , Mike ? MIKE : Came from a farmhouse just outside of Ladysmith . Coming down to pick you up . Right . You stay here . I 'm coming . That 's my family out there . You 're staying here . If Sullivan calls back and you 're not here to take the call ... All right . Please , Hawke ... We 'll be careful . Degenerates like your husband turn my stomach . Look at this girl . This is what happens when you mix with a lower race . Half-breed ! Names can 't hurt me . ( LAUGHING ) Smith Wesson can . When we have our weapons , we can defend our own nation , where purebreds can live the way God meant us to live , separate and white . You 're nothing but a handful of ignorant lunatics . ( SCOFFS ) Don 't count on it , lady . There 's more of us out there than you 'll ever know . And they 're just waiting to join us , when we 're ready . You can 't just stop the treatments . You 've got to give the therapy a chance to take hold . Those doctors are just measuring me for a coffin . I got better things to do with the time I got left . What 's more important than saving your life ? Spending the rest of it with you . That 's what I want to do , Joey . ( PHONE RINGING ) Jo Santini speaking . Right . I 'm on my way , Jason . I 've got some business I have to take care of . I 'll be back as soon as I can . Well , I thought we were going to spend some time together . We are . But I can 't get out of this . All right , then I won 't be here when you get back . Don 't do this to me . Don 't lay this guilt on me . Well , then let me come with you . Look , I know what you 're up to , and it 's dangerous . And if it 's my health you 're worried about , it 'd be a lot worse staying here and worrying about you . Look , if you 're going to come with me , you have to understand . You can 't tell anyone about it . Who am I going to tell about it ? When am I going to have the time to tell them about it ? Come on . What are you waiting for ? Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Give me a chance to change . There it is . They 've got the chopper . Scan the house . Four bodies inside , one outside . Do you read any radiation ? Not in the house . I 'll run a sweep of the area . They must have stashed the plutonium nearby . Contact Jason , see if he 's turned up anything on Sullivan . MIKE : We 're over the farmhouse now , Jason . Well , we just got word from an informant . Looks like Sullivan is arming his followers for a guerilla war . We 've located the shipment . It 's en route to the farm , heading west on Route 8 . So , what 's the plan ? We need some stall time . We 'll try and work out something . Let me know as soon as you locate the plutonium . Right . This reminds me of a time in Italy during the war . I was working reconnaissance . Wait a minute . You worked reconnaissance ? Oh , no . I know what you 're thinking . There 's no way you 're getting my father involved in any of this . Absolutely not ! Hey , let the man speak . What do you have in mind , sir ? My hands are shaking so bad , I can 't even get my heart pills . ( EXCLAIMS ) Childproof containers ... Eureka ! They 've got it stashed in the barn . Now wait a minute . No , it 's under the barn . They must have some kind of holding area down there . A bomb shelter . MIKE : Yeah . There 's no way we can retrieve it without them seeing us . ( HORN HONKING ) Hey , pops , get this wreck off the road . Yes , sir . Just give me a hand here and I 'll be out of your way in a jiffy . Just hand them up to me in the back of the truck . Just hang on to them groceries . And don 't drop them . Now , climb in the back of this truck , nice and slow . They 've made contact . Got a half a dozen automatic handguns , a gross of Uzis and plenty of ammunition . We delivered the goods , now it 's your turn . Where 's the plutonium ? ( COCKS RIFLE ) In a safe place . Inside . Now ! Earl , load up the chopper . A twist we didn 't count on . Yeah ? That 's not all . Longfellow just arrived . Hold it . Take it easy . I 'm on your side . We 've got the situation under control . What are you waiting for ? Why don 't you go in and get my family before they 're killed ? Calm down . We have to secure the plutonium first . It 's in a bomb shelter under the barn . We 've got to know if it 's volatile in those containers . No . Not unless the seals have been broken . It 's probably safer that way . Saint John , listen up . Here 's the scenario . By the time the police get here , there won 't be nothing left except a pile of smoking ashes and four dead bodies . ( LAUGHING ) Why don 't you just let us go ? You won 't gain anything by killing us . The trail ends here . Move ! Sherman , get the gas . In there . It 's all right . We 're friends . Are you hurt ? No . Just scared . Don 't worry . We 're all going to get out of this safe and sound . Why do these men hate me ? They don 't hate you , sweetheart . They just don 't know that what 's important is what 's in your heart , not the color of your skin . And you have a brave heart , don 't you ? Yes . That 's good . You come with me . Take your hands off her ! Dad ? ( EXCLAIMS ) You 're coming with us . Excuse me , do you sell fresh eggs ? All right , we got one of them . I 'm going in . I want a fireworks display in about two minutes . We 'll go in when you 're set . I 'm going in with you . Wrong . You go to the barn and you lay low . Don 't worry , I 'll get them out . Targeting the van . Hang on . Give me a minute more . Tony , I want my daddy . Don 't worry , sweetheart . We 're going to get you out of here . This is the moment of the beginning of the new order . And I will take you with me . The hell you will . Down on the floor . Open the door ! Shut up ! All right . Now ! Sherman , check upstairs . They 're inside the barn . Everyone except Jason and Jo . Lose it , Sullivan ! Give it up now ! She goes first . Hold it ! Sullivan 's got Jo . We see them , Jason . Dad ! Don 't worry . Airwolf will get him . He 's going to make a run for it . He can run , but he can 't hide . That thing 's got some firepower ! Oh , God . He 's going to try and explode the plutonium . Our people are in there . Come on . Make me a martyr ! Make it count , Saint John ! Well , that 's one way to cure a disease . Everybody okay ? Yes . Thank you . Thank you both . Aw , shucks , it weren 't nothing . I thought you bought it in there , Dad . Yeah , so did I. If I hadn 't been wearing my lucky belt buckle , I might have . Okay , coming in hot ! ( SCREAMING ) ( WHISTLE BLOWING ) What ? Traveling . Traveling ? What are you talking about , guy ? Where 's the ref ? I am the ref . You 're not the ref . Give me a break . Okay , I 'll be the coach . Let 's try some free throws , shall we ? Free ... Yeah , all right . Come on , Mikey . Come on . Another great shot by the king of the dribblers . I 've seen better dribbling from babies . Thanks , coach . One of you basket cases want to give me a hand ? Thanks . Where 's Tony ? He 's getting the rest of the gear . He , uh , he agreed to go back for treatments . TONY : Okay , all set . Tony , you look terrific . I feel great . Hey , how about if we come along ? Oh , no . This trip is just me and my girl . Right , Joey ? Right , Pop . Well , take good care of him . We wouldn 't want him to over-do it . Take care of who ? I 've got this thing beat with one hand behind my back .

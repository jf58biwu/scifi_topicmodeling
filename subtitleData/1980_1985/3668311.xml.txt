You know , Anthony is so thoughtful about things like that . Would you like to sit beside me ? - Maybe your mother would ... - Oh , no , no , no . You see , I 'm going to have to be fixing supper . Yes , that 's right . You sit right next to Anthony . Oh , that 's fine . Just fine . - All right , all right . - Very good , yes . WOMAN [ ON TV ] : Now you listen to me . Don 't you dare bring one more thing into this house . Do you hear me ? One more thing . Not one solitary single thing . A mouse . Darling , do you remember where supper is ? You know where it is .

I 'll help you find it , mother . - We 'll be back in just a little while . - Me too . BIRD [ ON TV ] : We cartoon characters can have a wonderful life if we only take advantage of it . We can do anything we think of . What do you mean , chum ? Well , supposing I decide I want to be a mouse . Click . I 'm a mouse . Supposing ... ANTHONY : This is a good cartoon . Click . I 'm myself again . - What else do you like ? - Nothing else is as good . Anything can happen in cartoons . Here we go . Good eatings for everybody . We 've brought supper , yeah . - Yes , sir . - All right , all right . Come on . Come on , Anthony . This is yours , dear , in your regular place right there . And , Helen , why don 't you sit right here next to Anthony ? - This is for you , Uncle Walt . - Thank you . - There you go , mother . HELEN : Thank you . Thank you , mother . You 're welcome , Anthony . A-ha . - Mm . - Mm , yummy . Oh , I love this . This is the greatest . It really hits the spot . MOTHER : I just love this . - Okay ? MOTHER : That 's wonderful , isn 't it ? - Fine . WALT : Is it ever okay . Boy , this is good stuff . I love this stuff . You just take a taste of that . You won 't forget it . Peanut butter . It 's good that way . FATHER : It really hits the spot . MOTHER : It 's the best . - Peanut butter makes the burger . - Oh , that 's right . That 's right . Wouldn 't go down otherwise . ETHEL : Peanut butter 's good for you . WALT : I could eat another plateful . MOTHER : Yeah , it 's great . You eat like this all the time ? Anthony can always have anything he wants . - Anything at all . - Ha , ha , ha , you bet . Well , don 't you think it 's good ? You 're young . You need your nutrition . You can 't eat like this all the time . MAN [ ON TV ] : You can 't fool me . It 's not good all the time . - No . - No , it 's not . - It 's not . - You 're right , Anthony . - That 's absolutely right . - You hit the nail on the head . WALT : You 're a growing boy . - You 'd never tell me that . MAN [ ON TV ] : No . Not " Happy Birthday . " No . Not " Happy Birthday . " Oh . Of course . It 's a birthday supper . Another birthday ? With presents ? ETHEL : And wishes ? I didn 't do it . It 's okay . Everything 's okay . [ CHUCKLING ] I 'm sorry , Anthony . I really have to be going . ANTHONY : Please don 't go . Uncle Walt 's gonna do a trick . ANTHONY : He 's gonna do a trick . MOTHER : Oh , you 've got to stay . I 'm sorry , Anthony . - He 's gonna do a trick . - Come back , come back . - Great , great . - Do the hat trick , Uncle Walt . Yes . Oh , yes . Where 's the hat ? - Excuse me . - It 's on the TV . There it is . All right . Let 's go . Now then , you 've got to stay here . You sit right down there . That 's right . The hat trick . Well , let 's see ... Ha , ha . Nothing up the sleeve . There we go . That 's it . Nothing up the sleeve , see that ? Ha , ha , ha , well ... WALT : Nothing up the sleeve . - Fun , isn 't it ? And , oh , I beg your pardon . Excuse me . Go ahead , Uncle Walt . Well , oh , yes . But the hat . Where 's the hat ? Oh , oh . How about that ? Yes , there we go . Nothing , as you can see , in the hat , right ? Nothing in the hat . WALT : So , uh ... You 'll like this . ANTHONY : Do it , Uncle Walt . Yes , sir . [ ALL LAUGH ] - Go ahead , Uncle Walt . WALT : Yes . Ah . Tada . WALT : You see ? Isn 't this fun ? We do it a lot . HELEN : Anthony ... - You 'll love it here . MOTHER : Really , I promise . FATHER : No , I swear to you . Do more . [ SCREAMING ] [ GROWLING ] [ SCREAMING ] Go away . Please don 't go , Helen . I can make it real nice here . I can make the food just the way you said it should be . I can even change the house . Just say it and I can make whatever you like . Just don 't ... I told you . They hate me . ANTHONY : They wanna send me away to someplace bad just like my real mother and father did . That 's not right , Anthony . You know we wouldn 't do that . No , we love you , Anthony . Honestly , we do . - Sure . ANTHONY : They 're afraid of me . Everybody is . That 's why they act that way . And I do everything for them . They can just sit around and watch TV all day . No one has to do a thing . Not a thing . And I 'm real good all the time . That 's right . You 're a good boy , Anthony . You 're a good boy . We love you . Yeah . Well , then I wonder who wrote this note . I wonder who called me a monster . It wasn 't me , Anthony . Why , I 'd never do anything like that . You know that . Don 't look at me . Me either . It wasn 't any of us , Anthony . It was her . - No , it wasn 't me . - No , her . Her , her . Ethel . It must have been Ethel . Of course , it had to have been Ethel . Yes . Ethel , there you are . WALT : It was Ethel . That 's right . Oh , great . MOTHER : It had to have been Ethel . Of course , it was Ethel . Of course . Oh , I didn 't know that . What a big surprise . Ethel , huh ? ETHEL : Go ahead , Anthony . Do it . Do it . Do what , Ethel ? Now do you realize you 'll never get out of here ? You think it was an accident you came here ? He made it happen . ETHEL : He brought you here , just like he brought us here and kept us here . Just the way he 'll keep you here . Maybe he 'll get mad at you , like he did to his real sister and take away your mouth so you won 't be able to yell at him anymore . Or maybe he 'll do to you what he did to his real mother and father . Time for you to go now , Ethel . Anthony , don 't . ANTHONY : It 's a big surprise . Just made it up . I 'm wishing you into Cartoonland . [ GASPS ] Jesus . I told you cartoons are good . Anything can happen in them . We 've been expecting you . [ LAUGH ING ON TV ] [ ETHEL SCREAMING ] Run , Ethel . Run . Tha ... tha ... tha ... That 's all , Ethel . [ SCREECHING ] ANTHONY : I can 't help it , Helen . I don 't want to hurt anybody . All I want is for people not to be afraid of me . You don 't understand . Nobody does . All I have to do is wish for something and it happens . I can do anything . Anything . [ SWOOSHING AND BEEPING ] [ LAUGH ING ] Wish it away , Anthony . Wish it away . I hate this house . I hate everything about it . I wish it away . I wish it all away . HELEN : Anthony ? Where are we ? ANTHONY : Nowhere . HELEN : And the others ? ANTHONY : I sent them where they wanted to go . Away from me . It 's not fair . You 're supposed to be happy when your wishes come true . Anthony , take us back . - Take us back . ANTHONY : So you can leave too ? And go where , Anthony ? I 've seen what you can do . I know you have a power , a gift that makes you special . You better be careful or one day it may become too big for you to control . Now , maybe , just maybe together , we can master it and learn from it . Use it in ways you never thought of before . I 'd like to be your teacher , Anthony . And your student . You 'd stay with me ? Yes . Always ? Always . Okay . HELEN : Anthony let 's not do too much more of that , okay ? - Sure . - Okay . Ah . All right . ANTHONY : Look in your pocket . Never mind . [ CAR ENGINE STARTS ] NARRATOR : What you 're looking at could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare . It isn 't . It 's the beginning . Introducing Mr. John Valentine , air traveler . His destination : the Twilight Zone . [ GASPING ] [ BEEPING ] PILOT : Ladies and gentlemen this storm has developed a little faster than we had anticipated . We 're maneuvering about , finding the smoothest spots with radar . There 's a chance that we might hit some whoopsie-daisies ... [ KNOCKING ] ... so I 'm asking you to return to your seats and fasten seat belts . Please extinguish your cigarettes . Store anything that might fly about the aircraft . - Look out the window and enjoy the flight . - Hello , in there . Can you hear me ? Hello ? Oh , hi . It 's a passenger that 's been in there for a long time . - Tall , fair-haired ? - Yeah , yeah . Seat 4A . Oh , Valentine . Had a feeling about him . White-knuckle type . - How are we gonna get him out ? - Is something wrong ? - Everything 's fine . Return to your seat . - Mr. Valentine ? May I help you ? Just a moment . Dionne , why don 't you knock ? Something could be wrong . Let 's give him a few more minutes . Are you okay ? No problem . Mr. Valentine , I know how you feel . Lots of people are nervous about flying . But if you look at statistics , you 're safer up here than on the ground . - That 's right , safer than your bathroom . - Oh , I 'll be perfectly fine . Okay ? Everything 's gonna be fine . We 're gonna help you back to your seat . Actually , the chances of drowning in the bathtub is something like 800 thousandths of a percent . Whereas air-crash fatalities , from last year 's figures the number of passengers who traveled last year is equal to the population of the whole country . - Okay , I got you . - That 's 426,504,000 . I forgot the rest specifically . Who died actually at home , they outnumber the people much more . And , whereas driving ... Driving ? Just forget it . I mean , the percentage of people who die driving ? - Twenty-two , 23 percent of ... STEWARDESS : Here you go , Mr. Valentine . VALENTINE : Do I need my boarding pass ? STEWARDESS : No , you don 't need it . Watch your head . STEWARDESS : Thattaboy . MAN : I think I spilled my drink . I think I spilled my drink . Oh , I 'm sorry , sir . Here , let me fix you up . [ THUNDER ROARS ] Put these things away here . STEWARDESS : Micro Chip Logic . The Liberation of the Left Brain . Science-fiction fan , huh ? It 's a textbook . Computers . STEWARDESS : Do you really read this stuff ? - I wrote it . STEWARDESS : My goodness , so you did . I tell you what , we 'll put this away and you try to get some sleep . No , no , no . I 'd like you to leave the light on , please . STEWARDESS : Okay . I 'll take this , okay ? Come on . Tell you what , I 'll put this in a safe place . Look , you 're gonna be fine , so cheer up . Okay ? Get me some water . - Let 's get this seat belt fastened . - Is something wrong ? Oh , no . Everything 's fine . - Look , we 're not supposed to do this . - What ? But I have these sedatives . They might help you sleep . No , it 's all right . I don 't need anything . I 'll be fine . - They 're very mild . - No . Thank you , but I 'll be all right . This will cost you 4 bucks . - What did you say ? - Only kidding . Well , I 'm not . We 've gotta get you back to your seat . GIRL : I wanna stay here . DIONNE : Oh , no , no , no . We 've gotta get you back here . Here we go . Now let 's fasten your seat belt . - I don 't need my seat belt fastened . - Oh , yes , you do . - Wouldn 't want you to fall out . - I 'm not gonna fall out . Not if you sit here you won 't . Okay ? Okay . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . DIONNE : You sure ? - Yes , I 'm sure . Look , I 'm Dionne . Anything you need , call me . Well , thank you , but I 'm sure I 'll be fine . Really . I 'll be fine . Okay . [ GIRL WHISTLES ] You heard the captain . No smoking . N-O S-M-O-K-l-N-G . No smoking . [ THUNDER ROARS ] VALENTINE : Oh , my God . There 's something out there ! There 's something moving . I 'm sure I saw it . - Out there on the wing . MAN : Where ? - There 's a man on the wing of this plane ! MAN : What ? WOMAN : Where ? MAN : There 's a man ... MAN 2 : Where ? WOMAN : I don 't see ... Of course there isn 't anything . There was somebody there . You 've gotta believe me . I saw him . Green and slimy . - Leave the poor man alone . - I 'm only trying to help . You 've got to humor them . It was lightning . At first I thought it was an animal . Some kind of bird or something , but it was a man . There was flames coming out of the engine and then a flash and then smoke . Maybe it was a technician who was caught on the plane when it took off . How could he survive out there ? The air 's too thin . The blast of the wind . It 's so cold . It 's impossible , isn 't it ? My God . I feel so stupid . Can you imagine ? A naked man crawling along the wing of an airplane at 35,000 feet . There 's no reason to feel embarrassed , Mr. Valentine . Just try to get some sleep . It 's amazing , the mind . How the eyes can make you see something that isn 't even there . There 's a man in Seat 3F who 's completely freaking out . You 're just gonna have to deal with him . It 's all right . You don 't have to stay with me . I know you have other passengers to attend to . - I 'd be happy to sit with you till you sleep . - No . It 's probably easier for me if I 'm alone . - Are you sure ? - I 'm sure . I 'm drowsy already . [ SNORES ] See ? Ha , ha . Okay . [ THUNDER ROARS ] [ SCREAMING ] Hostess , get the handcuffs ! I saw it . I saw it . I 'm all right , I 'm all right , I 'm all right . Don 't touch me , don 't touch me . GUARD : Let him up . FAA security . You want me to take care of this ? PILOT : No . He 'll be all right . VALENTINE : You 've gotta land this plane . PILOT : Look , just take your seat . PILOT : Can you get this together here , please ? Get everybody to sit down . Sit down , get in your seats . I want all the passengers in their seats . VALENTINE : You 've got to get out of the sky . PILOT : Thank you . VALENTINE : Land us ! PILOT : It 's okay . - Fly this thing down . - It 's all right . Deep breaths . - You know where you are ? - Yes . You gotta get us on the ground . - Take care of the little girl . - Okay . Come here , darling . Handcuffs . Far out . PILOT : That 's it , relax . - Come on , honey . You belong over here . - Mommy . - Attagirl . That 's it . GIRL : Mommy , a strange man , he 's got me . PILOT : Everything 's all right . - What has she done this time ? Take deep breaths , Mr. Valentine . Deep , long breaths . That 's it . Slow , relax . That 's it . We 're safe . We 're gonna have a little talk . Now , what seems to be the problem ? Would you look out that window , please ? What was I supposed to see out there ? Nothing . Nothing at all . I 'm sorry I shouted . Mr. Valentine , you 've got to see this my way . I 'm the first officer of an airplane in a severe storm . Now , I have an irrational passenger . You 're threatening the safety of this aircraft and frightening the passengers . You either calm down or we 're gonna handcuff you . Listen , there is something wrong with this airplane . If somebody doesn 't do something about it , we 're all gonna die . That 's D-l-E , die . You big silly . You used to be a normal person . MAN : Shelly . - Sit down , darling . Come on , okay ? Mr. Valentine . What do you think 's wrong with this aircraft ? There 's an engine out . Which one ? The one on the outside . Outboard Number 1 . It 's out , isn 't it ? - What makes you think that ? - Never mind about that . It 's true , isn 't it ? Nine minutes ago , Outboard 1 was struck by lightning . - There was a flameout and we lost it . - Lightning ? Lightning . Mr. Valentine , this aircraft has four engines . The possibility of us losing one of the remaining three is remote . Are you sure it was just lightning ? Absolutely . Listen , we 're gonna be landing in about 20 minutes . There is the highest probability that we 'll survive this flight . Okay . We 'll see you downstairs in 20 minutes . Sit down . Buckle them up . STEWARDESS : Are you okay ? No . No , no , no . [ GIRL LAUGHING ] I love you , baby . Hail Mary , full of grace . The Lord is with thee . Oh , my God . WOMAN : We 're gonna die . STEWARDESS : Please , sir , would you please just take your seat ? Nothing , nothing . Help . Sir ? Sir ? GIRL : Mommy . Mommy . What are you doing now ? That 's very bad manners , you know . GIRL : Didn 't anyone ever teach you manners , huh ? Come on . Come on . [ METAL CLINKING ] MAN : We 're all gonna die . VALENTINE : Damn . [ WOMAN SCREAMING ] [ VALENTINE GRUNTS ] MAN : My gun . Oh , my God . He 's got a gun . [ ALL SCREAMING ] [ GUNSHOTS ] [ WHEELS WH IRLING ] And that 's exactly how it happened . I 'm practically a hero . Would you believe that ? PILOT : If that weather hadn 't broke we would have never have gotten this baby down . What a hell of a night . We got the storm , we got the flameout , and then that freak show . Not to mention the gun . The gun was awful . - He didn 't have a gun . - He had a gun ? No , no , no , he didn 't have a gun . It was my gun . - I 'm FAA . I 'm authorized to have a gun . - He was so crazy . He smashed the window . What was he trying to do , get out ? It 's claustrophobia . They 'd rather fall to the ground than stay aboard . - I 've seen it happen . I 've seen it . - You 'd have to be wacko . He was frightened , but I didn 't think he was crazy . But he said he saw something out on the wing alive . Max , we lost Number 1 . Check out Number 2 , will you ? Somebody give me a light . I want the gear pinned . - Let 's chock these tires . MAN : Right . Franco , let me know what 's going on with these flaps . I wanna know if there 's any fuel leaking out of this baby . And get these people out of here . [ SIREN WAILING ] MAN : Yeah , that 's fine , Maxie . Everything 's okay here , Max . Max . Max ! Max ! Holy Toledo . MAX : Hey , you guys , what happened up there ? [ POLICE SIREN WAILING ] [ LAUGH ING ] DRIVER : That 's enough of that noise , huh ? Who needs it anyway ? How about a little music ? Sure . [ " MIDNIGHT SPECIAL " PLAYS ON RADIO ] Hey , that 's ... That 's ... I love Creedence . So you had a big scare up there , huh ? Oh , yeah . Wanna see something really scary ? NARRATOR : There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is know to man . It is the middle ground between light and shadow between science and superstition and it lies between the pit of man 's fears and the summit of his knowledge . This is the dimension of imagination . It is an area which we call the Twilight Zone .

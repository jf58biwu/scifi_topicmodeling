 ( STATIC HISSING ) ( CHEERY ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING ) MAN : Civic TV , the one you take to bed with you . Max , it 's that time again . Time to slowly , painfully ease yourself back into consciousness . No , I 'm not a dream , although I 've been told I 'm a vision of loveliness . MAN : ( CHUCKLES ) Who told you that ? I 'm nothing less than your faithful girl Friday , Bridey James , here with your wake-up call of today , which is Wednesday the 23rd . You got that ? Wednesday the 23rd . And I have a message . Remember your meeting this morning at 6 : 30 with Shinji Kuraki of Hiroshima Video . This meeting is to take place at the Classic Hotel , Suite 17 . And needless to say , it 's your first of the day . Don 't you know anyone who works 9 : 00 to 5 : 00 ? Over and out , Commander . MAN : Civic TV , the one you take to bed with you . ( CHEERY ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING ) ( SIGHS SOFTLY ) ( GROANS ) MAN : Sweetie , open the door , will you ? WOMAN : Go away . Come on . You know I love you . For fuck 's sake , open the door ! WOMAN : I don 't wanna open the door . I wanna get out of this place ! For fuck 's sake , open the door ! ( BABY CRYING ) You know I love you , you just gotta open the fucking door ! Well , I looked over the stills . I am interested , a little bit . How many shows you got ? Thirteen , with a possibility of another six if the sales go well . - You got cassettes ? - Of course . ( BOTH CHUCKLING ) Hold it . Show me the last one . ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) Number 13 . But , Max , you won 't understand anything . Everything is set up in the first two . My audience ain 't gonna see the first two shows . Now , show me the last one . ( TRADITIONAL JAPANESE MUSIC PLAYING ) What do you think ? Can we get away with it ? Do we want to get away with it ? Oriental sex is a natural . I think it will get us an audience we never had before . I don 't like it. lt 's not tacky enough . - Tacky enough for what ? - Tacky enough to turn me on . Too much class . Bad for sex . Maybe . I don 't know . It 's soft . There 's something too soft about it . I 'm looking for something that will break through . Something tough . - Hey , Harlan . Enough ? - Oh , okay . Here we go . It 'll come through on that . We only got about 53 seconds so keep your eyes open . They 've got an unscrambler scrambler , if you know what I mean . It sensed that we were unscrambling and automatically changed its code on us . What satellite is it coming from ? - Snooker , I think . - Country of origin ? Assuming 53 seconds represents the period of delay , I 'd say somewhere in Malaysia ? Okay , here we go ! This is it . ( WATER SPLASHING ) ( WOMAN STRUGGLING ) There 's a wall behind her . What is that ? Clay ? Yeah . Wet clay . I think it 's electrified . ( STATIC GROWING LOUDER ) - That 's it ? - That 's it . - Grotesque , as promised . - Okay . Can you hang a searcher on it next time it ... Already working on it . I was pretty insulted when it just shrugged us off in less than a minute . Well , patrón , interested ? Yeah . Harlan , can you do something about these labels ? This is supposed to be a clandestine operation . You know what I mean ? Sí , patrón . MAX : You always find yourself getting just a little nervous even if you 've been doing it all your life , don 't you think ? RENA : Oh , yeah . Oh , for sure . - Of course , that 's part of the excitement of it . - Mmm-hmm . Do you smoke ? No , thanks . Just relax . ANNOUNCER : And now , here it is , The Rena King Show . And this afternoon , Rena 's guests are Max Renn , controversial president of Channel 83 , radio personality Nicki Brand , and media prophet Professor Brian O 'Blivion . Take it away , Rena ! Max Renn , your television station offers its viewers everything from soft-core pornography to hard-core violence . Why ? Well , it 's a matter of economics , Rena . We 're small . In order to survive , we have to give people something they can 't get anywhere else . And we do that . But don 't you feel such shows contribute to a social climate of violence and sexual malaise ? And do you care ? Certainly I care . I care enough , in fact , to give my viewers a harmless outlet for their fantasies and their frustrations . As far as I 'm concerned , that 's a socially positive act . What about it , Nicki ? ls it socially positive ? I think we live in over-stimulated times . We crave stimulation for its own sake . We gorge ourselves on it . We always want more , whether it 's tactile , emotional or sexual . And I think that 's bad . Then why did you wear that dress ? Sorry ? That dress . It 's very stimulating . And it 's red . You know what Freud would have said about that dress ? And he would have been right . I admit it . I live in a highly excited state of overstimulation . Listen , I 'd really like to take you out to dinner tonight . - ( MAX SPEAKING lNDlSTlNCTLY ) - Professor O 'Blivion , do you think erotic TV shows and violent TV shows lead to desensitization ? To dehumanization ? MAX : ls the microphone on ? The television screen has become the retina of the mind 's eye . Yes . That 's why I refuse to appear on television , except on television . Of course , " O 'Blivion " is not the name I was born with . It 's my television name . Soon , all of us will have special names , names designed to cause the cathode ray tube to resonate . - Yes . - ( MAX AND NICKl continue CHATTERING ) Nicki . ls Max Renn a menace to society ? I 'm not sure . He 's certainly a menace to me . MAX : When does the plot start to unravel here ? Who 's this black guy ? ls he a political prisoner ? There 's no plot . It just goes on like that for an hour . - Goes on like what ? - Like that . Torture , murder , mutilation . - We never leave that room ? - Nope . - lt 's a real sicko . - lt 's brilliant . - For perverts only . - lt 's absolutely brilliant . I mean , look , there 's almost no production costs . You can 't take your eyes off it . It 's incredibly realistic . Where do they get actors who can do this ? - Help me . I think he wants it . - Come on ! It 's worth checking out . Did you have any trouble locking on to it this time ? Not after I realized the Malaysia delay was a plant . It 's not coming from Malaysia ? ( lN DRAMATIC ACCENT ) You cannot fool the prince of pirates for long . Harlan , where is it coming from ? Pittsburgh . That 's in the USA . ( MAN ON TV SCREAMING ) Pittsburgh ? Pittsburgh . NICKl : Get professional help . WOMAN : But it 's not me . It 's my sister . It 's not your sister. lt 's you , lover . Can 't you tell ? Isn 't that why you called me ? You want help . You need help . You 're going insane . I can hear you disintegrating while you talk to me . - l 've got your number , haven 't I ? - ( WOMAN SOBS ) I hate my sister . I don 't want to. lt 's ripping me up inside . But I do . I do .

( WOMAN SCREAMING ) - God , I can 't believe it . - l 'll turn it off . No , no , no. lt 's okay . I can take it . Can you get it any clearer ? It 's a pirate tape . They scrambled it . ( WOMAN CRYING ) I like it . Yeah ? Yeah , it turns me on . Take out your Swiss Army knife and cut me here , just a little . I 'd say somebody 's beat me to it . ( WOMAN SCREAMING LOUDER ) I wonder how you get to be a contestant on this show . I don 't know . Nobody ever seems to come back next week . ( CHUCKLES ) What did you say happened to your shoulder ? A friend . I think he 'd like Videodrome . You let somebody cut you ? Uh-huh . What do you think ? I don 't know . You wanna try a few things ? ( GASPS ) ( GASPING SOFTLY ) ( MOANS ECHOING ) Max , thank God . Masha Borowczyk has been in your office for an hour . What were you doing last night ? Didn 't you get my message ? I don 't think I 'm ready for this . Coffee . Cigarette . Office . Masha . Go . She 's hot to trot . MASHA : I call it Apollo And Dionysus . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) MAX : Masha , does it ever get good ? It 's all good . Darling , I am looking for something a lot more contemporary . I want something that 's gonna show people what 's really going on under the sheets . This stuff is too ... It 's too naive. lt 's too sweet . Like you , darling . Well , it 's your market . Do you know a show called Videodrome ? - Video what ? - D-R-O-M-E . Videodrome . Like video circus , video arena . - You know it ? - No . It 's just torture and murder . No plot , no characters . Very , very realistic . I think it 's what 's next . Then God help us . - Better on TV than on the streets . - Excuse me . Arnold on line three . You interested in tracking it down for me ? I 'll see that you get the agent 's commission . I 'm interested . Let me try . Max . Did you ever think of producing your own show ? Right here ? I could be your agent , worldwide . I could sell subterranean for you everywhere . No , I don 't have the temperament . But , if you did , what kind of show would you do ? I mean , for the subterranean market . Would you do Videodrome ? Max . Mmm-hmm . I 'm going away tomorrow for two weeks , on assignment . Guess where . LA . - Pittsburgh . - ( CHUCKLES ) Fabulous . Don 't stay in the sun too long . I heard it 's bad for the skin . Oh , come on . lsn 't that where they make Videodrome ? Yeah . Why ? I 'm gonna audition . I was made for that show . Nobody on Earth was made for that show . Hey , listen to me . - Listen to me . - What ? I want you to stay away from it ! Those mondo weirdo video guys , they 've got unsavory connections , they play rough . Rougher than even Nicki Brand wants to play . Do you understand me ? Sounds like a challenge . ( SIGHS ) Got a cigarette ? It 's not a challenge . I swear . You know , in Brazil , Central America , those kinds of places , making underground videos is considered a subversive act . They execute people for it . In Pittsburgh , who knows ? Max . Nicki , don 't ! Nicki , don 't . ( middle EASTERN MUSIC PLAYING ) Do you have a hangover ? I stayed up late watching TV . You get in touch with our friend in Pittsburgh ? In a way . At a distance . - The subterranean grapevine . - And ? Max , Videodrome is something for you to leave alone . It is definitely not for public consumption . Channel 83 is a little small to be considered public . It is still too public . Do you understand me ? No . What is it ? What 's the punch line ? I think it 's dangerous , Max , Videodrome . What ? It 's Mafia ? They do business . No , no , no. lt 's more ... How can I say ? More political than that . - Come on , Masha , what are we talking about ? - Videodrome . What you see on that show , it 's for real . It 's not acting . It 's snuff TV . I don 't believe it . So , don 't believe . Why do it for real ? It 's easier and safer to fake it . Because it has something that you don 't have , Max . It has a philosophy and that is what makes it dangerous . Whose philosophy ? There must be a name . Give me a name I can talk to . Masha , Masha , you know me . I stay away from the scary stuff . Max , you are going to have to be nice to me for this . We can take a shower together , any time you say . ( CHUCKLING ) I 'm sure you would be very beautiful but you 're a little older than I prefer . Thank you so much . Sell me a name , and I 'll make Apollo And Dionysus part of the package . That hurts me , Max . Hey , the world 's a shit-hole , ain 't it ? Yes , Max , it is . Brian O 'Blivion . That is the only name I have to give . Professor Brian O 'Blivion . WOMAN : Wait . Where are you going ? Come back here . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) WOMAN : Got to have a smoke with a cup of coffee . They don 't serve coffee in there , it 's piss water .

I did a panel show with Professor O 'Blivion . - The Rena King Show . - Oh , yes . You said some very superficial things . Violence , sex , imagination , catharsis . My exact words . What do you want ? I wanna talk with your father about a new twist in video that he may not be aware of . - l love the view . - You look like them , like one of Father 's derelicts . I think it 's the style. lt 's coming back . In their case , Mr. Renn , it 's not a style . It 's a disease forced on them by their lack of access to the cathode ray tube . You think a few doses of TV are gonna help them ? Watching TV will help patch them back into the world 's mixing board . Absolutely . I guess you encourage Father 's derelicts to make home movies for the world 's mixing board . Professor O 'Blivion sends video letters all over the world . - ls the Professor here ? - l am my father 's screen . Once you 've told me what this little visit is all about , he may choose to send you a cassette . If he does , which format would you like ? If he does , it 's gonna make conversation a little difficult . My father has not engaged in conversation for at least 20 years . The monologue is his preferred mode of discourse . Format ? Videodrome . ls that a Japanese configuration ? - You 've never heard of it ? - No . Then there have been serious gaps in your education . Videodrome . Mention it to your father . He may want to have a conversation . I love the view . HARLAN : Torture , murder , mutilation . MASHA : Videodrome . What you see on that show , it 's for real . NICKl : I 'm gonna audition . I was made for that show . MASHA : It has something that you don 't have , Max . It has a philosophy and that is what makes it dangerous . ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) Hi . This is your wake-up cassette and this came to the office for you by courier . What did they say at CRAM ? They said that Nicki Brand is definitely not on assignment for them . She had a month off coming to her . She decided to take it now . Don 't touch that ! ( GRUNTING ) Jesus , Max . You scared me . What the hell 's wrong with you ? I don 't know . I think I 'm getting a rash or something . What ? Are you all right ? Bridey , I didn 't mean to hit you . Hit me ? You didn 't hit me . No ? No , I know I didn 't hit you . I mean ... - Do you want me to stay here ? - Uh ... You look awful . Can I get you something ? No . No , I 'm just ... I 'm ... ( SIGHS ) I 'm exhausted . I was in a deep sleep when you knocked and I guess I 'm still not out of it . I 'll remember to set the timer , don 't worry . - You 're sure ? - l 'm sure . Thanks , Bridey . Tomorrow . Max , that other cassette is from the office of Brian O 'Blivion . I promised I 'd hand-deliver it directly to you . Will you call me if you need me ? - ( BREATHING ) - ( GASPS ) The battle for the mind of North America will be fought in the video arena , the Videodrome . The television screen is the retina of the mind 's eye . Therefore , the television screen is part of the physical structure of the brain . Therefore , whatever appears on the television screen emerges as raw experience for those who watch it . Therefore , television is reality and reality is less than television . ( UNDlSTORTED ) Max , I 'm so glad you came to me . I 've been through it all myself , you see . Your reality is already half video halIucination . If you 're not careful , it will become total halIucination . You 'II have to learn to live in a very strange , new world . I had a brain tumor . And I had visions . I believe the visions caused the tumor , and not the reverse . I couId feel the visions coalesce and become flesh , uncontrollable flesh . But when they removed the tumor , it was called Videodrome . I was the ... ( GAGGING ) I was Videodrome 's first victim . But who 's behind it ? What do they want ? I want you , Max . You . Come to me . Come to Nicki . Come on . Don 't make me wait . Please . ( NICKl BREATHING ) ( NICKl MOANING ) I want you , Max . You . Come on . Come to me now . Come to Nicki . Don 't keep me waiting . Please . Please . ANNOUNCER : Today , Lady Luck may smile on these four players and start them on the road to $ 12,000 ... We have a new group of people coming in this afternoon , so tell the staff about that . All right . Exciting . Very lively . Careful. lt bites . - You watched the cassette ? - Yeah . - And ? - lt changed my life . I 'm not surprised. lt 's dangerous , you know . Because your father admits he 's somehow involved with Videodrome ? More than that. lt bites . lsn 't that what you said ? What kind of teeth do you think it has ? It triggered off a series of hallucinations . I woke up with a headache . First time ever ? No , I 'd been hallucinating for a while ever since ... What ? Since I first saw Videodrome . How did you come to be exposed to it ? A pirate satellite dish . An accident . I made some tapes ... This is part of my own Videodrome collection . But that tape is just your father sitting at his desk . The tone of the hallucinations is determined by the tone of the tape 's imagery . But the Videodrome signal , the one that does the damage , it can be delivered under a test pattern , anything . Damage ? The signal induces a brain tumor in the viewer . It 's the tumor that creates the hallucinations . You let me watch it ? I expect them to come to me eventually to hurt me . I thought it might be you . Now I realize you 're just another victim , like Father was . Where is your father ? I think I 'd better talk to him . He 's in there . ( CLOCK BELLS chiming ) I 'm afraid he 'll disappoint you . This is him . This is all that 's left . What are you talking about ? Brian O 'Blivion died quietly on an operating table 11 months ago . The brain problem ? The Videodrome problem . You have it , too . - But he was on that panel show with me . - On tape . He made thousands of them , sometimes three or four a day . I keep him alive as best I can . He had so much to offer . My father helped to create Videodrome . He saw it as the next phase in the evolution of man as a technological animal . When he realized what his partners were going to use it for , he tried to take it away from them and they killed him , quietly . At the end , he was convinced that public life on television was more real than private life in the flesh . He wasn 't afraid to let his body die . Tell me about my Videodrome problem . My father knows much more about it than I do . Listen to him . Where 's Harlan ? He 's not in the lab . - l think he 's up in VTR . Max ... - Not now . - Harlan . - Sí , patrón ? Have you been hallucinating lately ? No . Should I be ? Yes , you should be . I believe that the growth in my head , this head , this one right here , I think that it is not really a tumor , not an uncontrolled , undirected little bubbling part of flesh , but that it is , in fact , a new organ , a new part of the brain . I think that massive doses ofVideodrome signal will ultimately create a new outgrowth of the human brain , which will produce and control hallucination to the point that it will change human reality . After all , there is nothing real outside our perception of reality , is there ? ( CHUCKLING ) You can see that , can 't you ? ( GASPS ) ( TELEPHONE RINGING ) MAN : Max Renn ? Yes . Who is this ? Barry Convex would like to talk to you about Videodrome . I 've got a car waiting downstairs for you , sir . MALE VOICE : Please direct your attention to the television set in front of you , Mr. Renn . Mr. Convex has recorded a little introduction for you . ( DREAMY synthesizer ARPEGGlATING ) Hi . I 'm Barry Convex , chief of special programmes . And I 'd like to invite you into the world of Spectacular Optical , an enthusiastic global corporate citizen . We make inexpensive glasses for the third world and missile guidance systems for NATO . We also make Videodrome , Max . And as I 'm sure you know , when it 's ready for the marketplace , things will never be quite the same again . It can be a giant hallucination machine and much , much more . But it 's not ready . Those were test transmissions you picked up . We thought nobody could tap into them . He 's good , that Harlan . Good pirate . Well , now that you have , I think we ought to have a little talk , don 't you ? I thought maybe my place ? ( CHUCKLES ) BARRY : I hope you realize you 're playing with dynamite . That 's our spring line . Top-secret stuff . I brought them with me for a trade show here in town later this week . Max Renn , I 'm Barry Convex . I think that machinery you 're wearing is too much for the shape of your face . Overwhelms you . Try something more spidery , more delicate . Here she is . This is our prototype . This is the little number that started it all . Max , I would like you to try this on for size . I would like to use this machine to record one of your hallucinations . Now . Then , I would like to take that tape back with me to home base for analysis . Do I get to keep the copyright ? I 'd hate to see it show up as a movie of week and not get paid for it . Max , I 'm trying to help you . What makes you think I need help , Barry ? None of our test subjects has returned to normality . They 're all in need of intensive psychiatric care . You seem to be functioning reasonably well so far . I 'd like to find out why . And I think an analysis of one of your hallucinations would be the right place to start . Will it hurt ? It won 't hurt you . You might catch yourself sliding in and out of a hallucinatory state after this is all over . If you do , just relax and enjoy it . It will soon go away . But for now , I think that you will find a little S and M will be necessary to trigger off a good , healthy series of hallucinations . That 's why our Videodrome show is so strange . It 's something to do with the effects of exposure to violence on the nervous system . It opens up receptors in the brain and the spine and that allows the Videodrome signal to sink in . You mean I 'm going to have to hurt you , Barry ? Afraid not . You don 't have to actually hurt anybody . You just have to think about it . ( SCREAMS ) That 's too bright ! I can 't take it ! - Yes , I forgot ! Sorry . How 's that ? - Shit ! Yeah . Yeah , that 's fine . Okay , we 're rolling . The taping mechanism is all self-contained . You don 't have to do anything now but hallucinate . MAX : Yeah , yeah . Okay . I 'll come back for you later . You 'll forgive me if I don 't stay around to watch ? I just can 't cope with freaky stuff . Nicki ? Nicki . Well , here we are at last . Right where we ought to be . On Videodrome . What are you waiting for , lover ? Let 's perform . Let 's open those neural floodgates . ( NICKl BREATHING ) ( NICKl GASPS ) ( NICKl EXCLAlMS ) ( EXCLAlMING ) ( GASPS ) What 's going on , Professor O 'Blivion ? I mean , really . ( EXCLAlMS ) Oh , Masha . ( SIGHS ) Harlan. lt 's Max . Can you come over to my apartment ? Right away . Yeah , I 'm serious . Come on in . Well , here I am , patrón . Camera . Flashgun . What 's up ? You want to be a centerfold ? I want you to go into my bedroom and I want you to take a look at what 's in my bed . Uncover it . Don 't be shy . I want pictures . - Pictures of what 's in your bed ? - Yeah . Do it ! Sure . Okay . ( SIGHS ) Well ? Max , I don 't see anything . You didn 't just want me to shoot your bed , pillows , sheets , did you ? Max , are you in some kind of drug warp ? I 've got friends who can help . Bridey said she came by a couple of days ago and you were ... Did you tape Videodrome last night ? Yeah , if it was transmitted , the machine would have caught it . I 'll meet you in the lab in one hour . I want to see it . Jesus , Max , it 's not even 7 : 00 a.m. Harlan , I am not just fucking around , do you understand me ? Well , fuck you . I 'm not just some fucking servomechanism you can switch on and off . You want me to fall out of bed and run around like an asshole , you tell me what I 'm doing it for . Otherwise , I 'll see you during office hours , patrón . Harlan , you 're right . It 's momentum . I 'm running like an express train here . I don 't know how to stop . Look , I 'll meet you in the lab in one hour , okay ? And then we 'll see if we pulled in any Videodrome last night and I 'll tell you what 's going on . Everything . I promise . Okay ? Okay . Sorry I freaked out on you , patrón . - l don 't work with you for the money . - l know that . With pirates , it 's never just for the money , is it ? You want a cup of coffee ? No . I 'll meet you in the lab in an hour . Come on in . Did you look at the tape ? Did you see me on Videodrome ? There was no tape . There was no Videodrome transmission last night ? Not last night . Aw , fuck . Not ever . What are you talking about ? ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) I 'm out of my depths now , patrón . I had to bring in the reinforcements . Max . An intriguing combination . Very interesting . BARRY : Don 't let me interrupt . I think I was saying something like , " What are you talking about ? " I was playing you tapes , Max . Prerecorded cassettes . Videodrome has never been transmitted on an open broadcast circuit . Not yet . I guess Barry sent you here , what , two years ago ? It has been two years , hasn 't it , Harlan ? Two . Two wonderful years . Why ? To get you involved . Expose you to the Videodrome signal . It didn 't affect you because you never watched it ! You knew what was there . You didn 't have to see it . It really does work on just about anybody . Anybody who watches it , Max . But why would anybody watch it ? Why would anybody watch a scum show like Videodrome ? Why did you watch it , Max ? Business reasons . Sure . Sure . What about the other reasons ? Why deny you get your kicks out of watching torture and murder ? You murdered Brian O 'Blivion , didn 't you , you freak ? Did you enjoy that ? North America is getting soft , patrón , and the rest of the world is getting tough . Very , very tough . We 're entering savage new times and we 're going to have to be pure , and direct , and strong if we 're going to survive them . Now , you and this cesspool you call a television station , and your people who wallow around in it , and your viewers who watch you do it , you 're rotting us away from the inside . We intend to stop that rot . We 're going to start with Channel 83 , Max . We 're gonna use it for our first authentic transmissions of Videodrome . I have a hunch it 's going to be very popular for a while . I 've got to be hallucinating now , right ? I mean ... You two can 't possibly be for real . We did record your hallucinations , Max , as I said we would . And we did analyze them . You 're ready for something new . That 's terrific . ( BREATHING ) What do you ... What do you want from me ? I want you to open up , Max . Open up to me . I 've got something I wanna play for you . Oh , my God ! ( COUGHS ) BARRY : ( ECHOING ) We want Channel 83 , Max . Give it to us . Give us Channel 83 .

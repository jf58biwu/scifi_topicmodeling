 'The year is 1987 , 'and NASA launches the last of America 's deep-space probes . 'In a freak mishap , Ranger 3 and its pilot , Captain William " Buck " Rogers , 'are blown into an orbit which freezes his life support systems 'and returns Buck Rogers to Earth '500 years later . ' ( Man ) ' Ship stabilised at one-quarter power . ' - Advance to half power . - Roger . Advancing to half power . ( Erratic whirring ) I 'm getting severe vibrations . I 'm losing it . I 'm losing it ! So much for hero number seven , isn 't it , Kane ? We 'll have to message my father for more posthumous medals . There is nothing wrong with my design . Of course not . Except that it kills our best pilots because no one can fly it . - Cancel the programme . - Your father would never agree . Sit down ! I know what my father would agree to . Because the Terrans have insulted me , I 'm allowed to destroy any city on Earth that I wish . Without this programme , Princess , it will be impossible to penetrate Terran defences . Then stop talking and find someone who can fly your hatchet fighter . Perhaps you . No . Not you . But there is a man who would be ideal . But Buck Rogers would never agree . We don 't need his permission . We have lab 23 . Hmm . Once we have a prototype , we can improve on the model . That I seriously doubt . It 's beautiful , Twiki . What exactly is it ? Bidibidibidibidi . Just what you ordered - a ping-pool table . Ping-pool ? I ordered a Ping-Pong table . Pool 's a different game . Bidibidibidibidi . There was a page missing from the construction manual . Somewhere between pong and pool , right ? - What is Ping-Pong , Buck ? - It 's a terrific game . Two , four people - excuse me , entities - can play . You hit the ball over the net with those two paddles . Oh , I see . Maybe . - Bidibidibidibidi . Why , Buck ? - Why ? Because it 's a game . - How quaint . - Well , let 's play it . You get an idea how it works when you see it in action . - I doubt that . - Get over there . Pick up the paddle . I 'll hit the ball over the net to you , you hit it back . OK ? If you say so . If the ball doesn 't go over the net , you lose a point . - Ready ? - Mm-hm . ( Twiki ) An ace , Buck . It didn 't go over the net . I won ! That was easy . What 's next , Buck ? ( Bleep ) - Dr Huer . - ' Is Colonel Deering there ? ' - Right here , sir . - ' Please report to my office . ' - Right away , sir . - ' Buck , you might find this interesting too . ' ( Bleep ) Come on , Twiki . ( Doors whooshing ) ( Steady beeping ) Our probes picked it up in our solar system . Like a letter from home . No of fence but it just looks like antique space junk . - Can I look inside ? - Yes , if you like . Good heavens , there 's an astronaut . - Who could it be , Buck ? - I can 't be sure . That ship was flying recon in my time . We might have trained together at NASA . I 'd like to take a ship up there . Of course . Take Twiki in case you have trouble with the airlock . Bidibidibidibidi . Our records show no further launches after yours , Captain Rogers . Your records have been off before . Buck 's right . There 's a capsule up there with an astronaut aboard . - Come on , Twiki , let 's move it . - Bidibidi . Oh , boy . Use caution , Captain Rogers . Prepare for docking . Easy does it . Ha ! Nothing to it . Is it safe to open this ? Bidibidibidibidi . It is if you push green-green-red-green . Something must be wrong . Maybe it 's stuck . Can you get it open ? You got it , boss . Theo was right - it 's a trap . Let 's go . - What 's going on ? - Looks like we 're about to take a trip . Bidibidibidibidi . Question is , where ? Captain Rogers . How good of you to drop by . Great costume . Going trick-or-treating ? Defiance . I always liked that in a man . - Did you like my invitation ? - I was swept away by emotion . Leave us . Shall I order the ambuquad disassembled ? Bidibidibidibidi . You ever have two broken arms , buster ? No . I 'd like Captain Rogers ' visit to be a pleasant one . A friendly ear in a strange place is such a comfort . Bidibidibidibidi . Put me down , you big ox . Now that we 're alone , Captain ... why don 't we make ourselves comfortable ? A toast . To friendships old and new . All right , what have you got up your sleeve this time ? Why , nothing but myself , Captain . Terrific . The Defense Directorate is gonna send a rescue squad . Granted - when they discover you 're missing and when they figure out where you are . By then , you 'll have fulfilled your mission here . My mission ? We have been through this . We have irreconcilable differences , remember ? No , I don 't . Let 's make the most of your time here , shall we ? - Kane , is lab 23 ready ? - Yes , Princess . Excellent . We 'll be there immediately . Come with me , Buck . I have someone I want you to meet . An old friend . I doubt a nice guy like me would know anybody here . On the contrary , Buck , you both have a lot in common . Kane . Bidibidibidibidi . Holy cow . That 's you , Buck . Captain Buck Rogers , meet Captain Buck Rogers . Something you made in crafts class ? Alloy skeleton , vat-grown protoplasm , the Empire 's most sophisticated minicomputer for a brain , zygot mark one , which will ... That 's enough , Kane . Fascinating likeness . Except I 'm alive . So shall he be . Once he 's programmed to your neural responses , we 'll have a Captain Buck Rogers superior to the original . Bidibidibidibidi . Once a dummy , always a dummy . Shall we ready him for the neural duplicator ? ( Twiki ) Run for it , Buck . ( Man over PA ) ' Alert , alert . Intruder in sector B. 'Alert . ' ( Buck straining ) You would be advised to remember you are only needed undamaged until the neural duplication is complete . And you would be advised to keep your guards under control . Captain Rogers is not to be harmed . Yes , Princess . ( Huer ) ' Starfighter 1314 , this is New Chicago command . ' Come in , Buck . There 's something wrong . I 'm gonna check out his starfighter . Very well . But be careful . ( Ardala ) You look reasonably comfortable . It 's not a sport coat and slacks but it will do . It 's a neural capacitance suit . Do tell . Why am I wearing it ? - You have something we want . - I 'm not feeling very generous . Everything you 've ever experienced is recorded in the neural cells of your magnificent body . This suit duplicates those neural memories . I pass . Negative . No , thanks . Not today , Princess . Don 't be nervous , Buck . It 's totally painless . I just don 't want your machine tiptoeing through my memories . Enough talk . Begin the search . Pleasant dreams , Captain . Ardala , I said no . If you touch that machine , I 'll ... You 'll what ? Anaesthetise him . ( Whirring ) There . His military experience . Lock on that . Record the patterns . We found the ship . Buck and Twiki are gone and so is the capsule . Then they must have boarded it . Begin a grid pattern search . Acknowledged . Deering out . Any data from that robot probe , Doctor ? The probe recorded a ship 's arrival at those coordinates - Buck 's shuttle . 20 minutes later , the probe logged a departure from that area . The capsule . Its power should have been exhausted a century ago . Display . This is an electromagnetic pattern , the fingerprint of the capsule 's drive . Any known pattern ? This read-out is characteristic of the Draconian Imperial drive units . They match . That wasn 't a space relic , it was an Imperial trap . What have they done with Buck ? What 's going on ? That 's not very neighbourly . As a matter of fact , it 's not even friendly . His reaction times are twice that of Draconian norms . It 's incredible . - Not as incredible as my zygot . - I seriously doubt that . If you doubt me , why aid me ? Because it amuses me , Kane . We have enough data . Terminate the illusion . ( Ardala ) ' Bravo , Captain . ' You fooled me , Ardala , but fighting holograms isn 't like the real thing . On the contrary . We created situations which are twice as a critical as the real thing . We recorded your marvellous responses . My zygots will be most appreciative . Guards , take Captain Rogers back to his cell . He must be very tired . Bidibidibidibidi . Why are they doing this ? They 're programming that zygot to be me , then sending it to Earth . - Why , Buck ? What are they trying to do ? - I wish I knew . Your father should be pleased with your addition to his suggestion that we destroy New Chicago . Yes . It will be much easier once we do away with that stuffy Dr Huer and that detestable Colonel Deering . You are truly your father 's daughter . - Everything is ready . Shall we go ? - Not yet . Bring Rogers to me . - What for ? - You are not to question my orders , Kane . - Ever . - Yes , Princess . - You sent for me ? - I did indeed . Make yourself comfortable . I need to make a decision , Buck . And I need your help . - Another test ? - Not exactly . Not everything has to be work . Some things are simply pleasure . I may be a Draconian princess but I still have feelings . If I told you that I 'd adjusted to the idea that our relationship was one-sided , that your feelings for me would never be as intense as my feelings for you , would you simply be my consort ? Not your husband ? No . - Not your slave ? - No , Buck , never . I 'm sorry . I can 't . But how can you reject me ? I 'm a Draconian princess . Buck , look at me . Am I so horrible ? Am I not beautiful enough for you ? - You 're a very beautiful woman . - Then why can 't you love me ? I can 't change my feelings simply because you want me to . But how do you know ? You 've never tried . Love isn 't something that two people can try to make happen . They either have something special or they don 't . And we don 't , Ardala . I 'm sorry . Captain Buck Rogers . You think you 're so special . One of a kind . Well , I have an answer for that . If I can 't have you one way , I 'll have you another . Hey , Princess . How you doing ? Who 's this clown ? That 's right , you 're me . What 's happening ? Listen , I 'm looking forward to meeting Wilma Deering , she is one sharp chick . - There goes my reputation . - You can 't talk that way about me . You 're good . But I 'm good too . Remember , I have your mouselike reflexes . - Mouselike ? - Correction - catlike . He 's a real winner . When does he learn to walk and chew gum at the same time ? Out ! Out ! Your wish is my command . Gentlemen , please be careful . After all , I am the master mould . Take it easy , Princess . Brick walls do not a castle keep . Oh , shut up . ( Low bleeping ) I believe I have located Twiki on board the Draconian ship . ( Low bleeping ) Yes . Those are his EM transmissions . They 're close enough to get a tight beam through . ( Huer ) ' Twiki ? ' Bidibi . Bidibi . Bidibidibidibi . 'Can we use you as a relay to Buck ? ' Bidibidibidibidi . Take me , I 'm yours . Buck ? Buck , Wake up . - Hm . What ? - ' Buck , wake up . ' - ' Buck . Wake up , Buck . ' - Must 've been dreaming . - Thought I heard Dr Huer . - ' You did . ' Twiki , will you stop playing games ? 'This isn 't a game , this is Dr Huer . ' - It is you . - ' Are you all right ? Can you report ? ' Excellent . They 've finally gotten through . But don 't let Rogers reveal our plan . I don 't have all the pieces yet but I think they 've found a way to ... We 're getting distortion from solar flares . Can you get out of your cell ? I can try . What then ? 'Wilma 's half a parsec from the mother ship . ' I 'll be right there . I hope . 'Good luck . Twiki , returning control to you . Thank you . ' Bidibidibidibidi . I feel funny . Never mind that . If you get that door open , we 'll be going home . Bidibidibidibidi . Sure . - Are the men in position ? - Yes , Princess . The magic touch . - Let 's go , Twiki . - Let 's go , Buck . Come on . - ( PA ) ' Alert , alert . Intruder in sector B . ' - Let 's go . 'All security guards report to your stations . Code three . 'Repeat . All security guards report to your stations . ' Bidibidibidibidi . Where are you , Buck ? Buck ? Hey , wait for me . Wait in the storage room while I pre-flight the ship . Bidibidibidibidi . Uh-oh . I think I 'm in trouble . ( Groaning ) Bidibidibidibidi . Buck , what happened ? Captain Buck Rogers calling Earth Defense Directorate . Come in . ( Wilma ) ' ls that you , Buck ? ' ( Buck ) ' Big roger . I 'm on my way home . ' Thank heavens . You 're both safe ? That 's a negative . Twiki didn 't make it . I 'm sorry , Buck . I 'll meet you at the stargate . - Let 's go home . - That 's a big ten-four . Why the long face , Captain ? Buck Rogers is on his way home . You guys are a sight for stiff eyes . I 'm sorry about Twiki . We 'll program another ambuquad just like him . But Twiki was Buck 's best friend . It wouldn 't be the same , would it ? - Who knows ? I guess not . - I understand . I 'd forgotten how beautiful you are . Well , I 'm glad to see you too , Buck . I think . As you see , Captain , you can be replaced . Do you feel better now ? That zygot was just the first . There will be three more and they are all programmed to destroy New Phoenix . Using your neural patterns and our hatchet fighters , they 'll slip through Earth 's defences like they 're not there . You can watch the attack - after all , you are the star , all three of you . And the prototype is armed with a one-kilotonne nuclear device which is programmed to detonate when he 's with New Chicago 's three top leaders . ( Clears throat ) Buck , are you all right ? Sure . Hi , Wilma . - Thinking of Twiki ? - Twiki ? Oh , yeah , I 'm really at the dumps about him . You haven 't been taking care of your plants . Plants ? That 's right , I like plants , don 't I ? Buck , what 's wrong ? I saw something important on the Draconian ship . It could help us . - What is it ? - I 'm not sure , I was doped up . Let 's get together with Huer and Theopolis to discuss it . As soon as Dr Huer comes back from inspecting the defences , we 'll meet . Great . It 'll be very explosive stuff . Yeah . ( Electrical buzzing ) ( Men shouting ) Bidibidibidibidi . Ready ? Ready as I 'll ever be . ( Groaning ) You guys fighting or dancing ? You 're insulting a Draconian soldier , Earth trash . Is that what you call yourselves ? I 'd show you how to use those but you probably bruise easily . Besides , I like a good fight . Earth trash , come feel the sting of a Draconian soldier 's stun stick . Bidibidibidibidi . That smarts . Bidibidibidibidi . Nice work , champ . They never laid a glove on you . Some days the magic works . Bidibidibidibidi . And some days it doesn 't . Do you still think your Buck Rogers will be better than the real man ? These are Imperial combat weapons , not my Buck Rogers , and they can do anything he can only twice as well . Really ? Bidibidibidibidi . ( Laughs ) That tickles , Buck . A-ha . I knew it . They had you bugged . That 's how they knew we were trying to escape . Bidibidibidibidi . No wonder I felt so funny . Yeah . ( Sighs ) Now we can figure a way to sabotage the duplicating machines - without them listening in . - Do you have a plan ? An idea . I 'm the master mould , right ? A flawed mould means ruined models . I just can 't figure out a way to flaw me . Bidibidibidibidi . If you were a computer , I could short-circuit you . - That 's it . - What 's it ? If you sent a small current through my body it would jangle my neural responses . Bidibidibidibidi . And curl your hair too . And it could give Kane and Ardala some shocking results . Bidibidibidibidi . All right . Ready , Buck ? I 'm receiving strange synaptic responses , like he 's been drinking Antaerian brandy . Nonsense , Kane . Continue programming the Captain 's clones . Perhaps I 've been too harsh with you , Kane . Yes , much too harsh . I 'm glad somebody else noticed . I thought I was crazy . No , not at all . He 's just not the same Buck Rogers . - It 's almost as if his spirit is missing . - Yes . - It 's so strange . - A possibility . Psychosurgery while a prisoner . That 's conceivable . Which would mean ... - Hi , gang , what 's going up ? - Hi , Buck . Correction . Should read , " What 's coming down ? " Wilma , Dr Huer , Dr Theopolis , we 're finally all together . ( Man over PA ) ' Red alert , red alert . Evacuate level three . ' - What is it , Doctor ? - Sensors detect a Draconian bomb . The radiation profile indicates explosion is imminent . - Where is it ? - A search is being conducted . - What are you doing here ? - The bomb is in this room . It 's right here . - Excuse me , sir . - Detonation minus five seconds . Four , three , - two , one ... - Wilma . Bomb destroyed . End red alert . ( PA ) ' Red alert terminated . ' - It wasn 't Buck , it was a robot . - Yes . Doctor , put all Earth units on full wartime alert . We just don 't know when Ardala will make her next move . Well , looks like the end of the line for Rogers the robot , Ardala . Kane , your zygot doesn 't have what it takes . That was only the prototype . The production models are far superior . Tests prove that they are capable of defeating any Earth unit , despite your childish attempt to sabotage our programming . Captain Rogers appears worried . Perhaps for once you 've got something . We are ready to strike . Shall I give the order ? Patience , Kane , dear . First , send the zygots to my chambers . I wish to inspect them personally . You see , Buck , with three Buck Rogers , you become , shall we say , redundant ? At ease , Captains Rogers . Make yourselves at home . I 've waited a lifetime for this moment . Not quite yet . Be patient . Join me . - That sounds intense . - I intend it to be . Maybe later . I 'm into my own space right now . Typical bomber driver . Doesn 't know how to handle anything . - Including a woman . - How would you handle a woman ? Easy on the controls , pre-flight her real slow while you 're waiting for clearance . There was one honey at Clark when I was flying F-16s . Gently . She was fine . But those F-16s , they were really sweet . I remember one mission ... What can she conceivably do with three Buck Rogers for an hour and a half ? Weasel said there was a SAM-12 on my tail so I hit right rudder ... - Hold it , fly boy . - What ? - What about the woman ? - What woman ? - I 'm talking about F-16s . - I know . I know . For two hours . - There 's more to life than flying , Princess . - What did you have in mind ? Soft music , slow dancing . - What 's the matter , Princess ? - Leave me alone . Leave me alone . - Buck ? - What do you want , Ardala ? Nothing . Never mind . I am Princess Ardala . - Kane . - Yes , Princess ? Those zygots , they had better know something about fighting . Launch the attack against Earth immediately . As you wish , Princess . Earth is defenceless against you . And now , my zygots , your instructions . Two of you will engage the Earth starfighters and keep them at bay . A third will avoid all combat and obliterate New Phoenix with an antimatter bomb . For the Empire . ( All ) For the Empire . - OK , Twiki , you got it ? - Bidibidibidibidi . Sounds like a real long shot . How was your party ? The zygots were launched ten minutes ago . Soon New Phoenix will be a memory . She never answered my question . Bidibidibidibidi . Party must 've been a bust . Poor Ardala . Always a bridesmaid , never a bride . Bride . Bride . Bride . - What 's the matter with you ? - Who , me ? Me . Me . Another zygot . I 've been deceived . You know , Twiki , sometimes you almost feel sorry for princesses . Bidibidibidibidi . Almost . Let 's truck , Buck . Bidibi . Bidibi . Bidibidibidibidi . ( Beep ) Come on . ( Low beeping ) - Here it is , it 's coming in now . - Hatchet fighters . The first wave of Ardala 's attack . Scramble all squadrons . Section oboe-3 . Lead the first squadron . Intercept those fighters and destroy them . Yes , Doctor . He 's escaped in one of your fighters masquerading as a zygot . - Impossible . - But it 's a zygot in the cell . The read-outs from those ships ... no human would register a positive electrostatic pulse . ( Bleeping ) This way , Twiki . Bidibidibidibidi . The fool will never make it . The port 's closing , Buck . Hang on , it 's gonna be a tight squeeze . Something 's wrong . Even my zygots can 't control a ship at that speed . There is no error . It 's impossible to capture him now . He 's on an intercept with our attack force . - That 's just fine . - Fine ? What do you mean , fine ? What can one Buck Rogers possibly do against three ? We shall see , Kane . We shall see . Echo element , deploy as high squadron . Victor element , fingers four . 'Any Earth station , this is Buck Rogers . Emergency . ' - Buck ? Is that you ? - ' Yeah , it 's me . ' Running half a light second behind three more of me . Bidibidibidibidi . Here comes the cavalry , Wilma . - Twiki ! It really is you , Buck . - ' I think so . ' You 're about to meet three fast , nasty ships , piloted by duplicates of me . - ' What are your tactics , Buck ? ' - ' Don 't close . Don 't let them on your tail . ' They 'll try to bounce you from behind . I 'm on my way . They 're all over us . We can 't hold . Alert . One of them has broken through . - Objective ? - New Phoenix . ( Zygot ) ' OK , Buck Rogers , looks like I win this time . 'One more second and no more New Phoenix . 'No , you don 't . ' Hang tough , Wilma . Two down , one to go . It 's your turn to go . Gimme your best shot . All right , catch . Boring , Buck . Boring . - Which way you gonna break ? - Just keep your eyes open , son . - Which one ? - ( Beeping ) Which one ? Bidibidibidibidi . Way to go , Wilma . You should have known your plan was destined to fail . The plan was flawless . It was the execution that failed . Kane , it was doomed from the start , believe me . There 's only one Buck Rogers . Now that is a Ping-Pong table . Bidibidibidibidi . I liked the ping-pool better . Interesting , yes . - I must say , it 's very interesting . - Wanna play ? Oh , I think not . Come on , I 'll show you the ropes . It 's easy . Ball . Paddle . You hit the ball over the net with the paddle . Here we go again . - Er , am I holding it correctly ? - That 's just fine . When I hit the ball to you , you hit it back . OK ? You ready ? Here we go . He-hey . Ooh . - Not bad for a beginner . - Rather . Quite good , actually . Here we go again . If I didn 't know better , I 'd think I was being hustled . Hustled ? What 's hustled ? Listen , Doc , I 'm beat . I feel like something the dog dragged in . Bidibidibidibidi . " Cat " dragged in , Buck . Bidibidibidibidi . Uh-oh . There 's something fishy going on here , folks . Dr Huer , it sounds like ... A zygot malfunction . It can 't be . It just can 't be . - Gotcha . - Ah . ( Laughs )

 Hello ? No , don 't shoot me ! Josh ... - Where is everybody ? - They 're gone . - How long ago ? - About three days . You 've been alone since then ? Well , you 're not anymore . What happened ? Lots of people tired of what the Visitors are doing . Bunch of ranch hands came in and threw a bomb underneath a squad vehicle with the local supervisor guy inside . They blew it up and killed him . But he was shouting about how we 're in America and they weren 't gonna stand for these Visitors . And there was clapping and cheering and then there were these lights pouring down . Some people screamed and ran . Some shot guns . They kept on coming , the shock troopers . A lot of them . A whole lot of them . I lost my mom and dad but Sean 's mom grabbed me . She pulled us into the house . But there were these lights and noise . She slammed the door . Get back ! But they were everywhere outside . And then I saw these awful eyes . That 's okay , kiddo . You 're all right now . Then what happened ? They broke through the door and took them . He fought really hard and kicked at them to leave his mom alone . He fought and said his dad would get them . He was real brave , Sean was . But me ... I ... I hid back in the closet . I was scared . I 'm sorry , Mr. Donovan , I should have helped . Josh . Hey , come on . Don 't beat yourself up about it . There wasn 't anything you could 've done . What happened then ? They took them , everybody , to the square . There was a lot of shouts and crying . Then the lights were gone . And so was everybody . Everyone but me . " I only have escaped alone to tell thee . " Mr. Donovan , will I ever see my mom and dad again ? You bet . Josh , when I came to visit Sean I brought him something . Yeah , I remember . What 'd he do with it ? Do you know ? Yeah , it 's over here . What is it ? It 's a key . That 's gonna get you into what ? The belly of the whale . Come on , kiddo . Champagne for breakfast . Classy . - Where 'd you get it ? - From a local merchant . One who knows the value that a friend can be . And now a toast . To my engagement . What ? - To whom ? - To Robin Maxwell . But she 's gone away . Well not that far away , huh ? What does Robin think about this , Dan ? She doesn 't know about it yet , but ... See , I want her . Just like I wanted this champagne . And I will get her , won 't I ? Otherwise , I 'll just have to turn her whole damn family in . - Come on ! - Stop it ! You 're crazy . - I 'm not going ! - Come on ! - You freak ! - Daniel ! Daniel ! Daniel ! Caleb I am sad for you . We both are , Caleb . You get away ! I don 't want you here . But , Caleb ... - Go on ! Get out of here ! - He felt bad , and we wanted ... - You go on ! - Papa , come on . You people killed my boy ! You killed him . Now you get out of here ! Willy , come on . You tried . You go on back where you belong ! You people killed my boy ! Go on now ! Go on ! - But they 'll grant my family amnesty ? - It 's just like we arranged . Who is this family that 's in hiding ? It 's just a bunch of scientists . Shalom . - Is everything all right ? - It 's okay so far . Now we have to run the roadblock . Katie , honey , be quiet . It 's all right . We won 't make it with her crying . Okay , try these . They 'll help . - You come prepared . - I 've had some experience at this . - Hello ? - Hello . I have a question . If I thought I knew someone , a scientist perhaps was being smuggled out what should I do ? Well , I 'm not interested in a reward , of course . Katie , be quiet . Mom , Dad , keep her quiet . Hi , officer . - How are you ? - Where are you headed ? - El Tepeyac . - What ? El Tepeyac . El Tepeyac ? What ? I know all the towns around here . Where 's El Tepeyac ? It 's a restaurant , best food north of Ensenada . El Tepeyac ? I never heard of it . What 's the story back there ? No story . It 's okay . - Let 's move it out then , Pedro . - Thank you , officer . Careful . It ain 't gonna be easy , walking down here with that cane . Well , I 'm gonna have to get used to it . The tunnel runs down underneath the city connects up with some really nifty places . It ain 't the Beverly Hills Hotel . But there 's a lot of space down underneath . Some bums sleep here sometimes . We 'll take anyone we can get . I 'm glad to hear that . - The electricity doesn 't work . - I 'll handle that . - It 's okay then ? - It 's perfect . Dynamite . While you get moved in I 'll go rap with the Angels . This is their turf . - You think you can get them to help ? - You kidding ? You are talking to the Henry Kissinger of East L.A. - I 'll catch you later . - Okay . Elias . Yes . Hello . Yeah , this is Daniel . Who took my father ? They said " arrested " ? But they promised amnesty ! They said ... Yeah , hi . Lynn Bernstein , please . Wait . What time did she go to lunch ? Well , that was four hours ago . She 's not at home ! Yes , I 'm sure ! I 'm at home alone . Here comes our boy , back from El Tepeyac . He had somebody hidden back here , but they 're gone now . What is it ? Just a token of appreciation for your hospitality . Oh , Steven ! So , what 's the plan ? Well , Josh needs to stay with Fran . It 's okay with me . - Do you like spaghetti ? - Sure . Okay , we 'll get along just fine . - There 's a rebel camp in the hills ... - Like in El Salvador ? Just like El Salvador , where a bunch of doctors and others are holed up . There 's another downtown , but I don 't know where . We 'll find it , but first I want to see what this unlocks . They must have some Achilles ' heel , something we can use against them . We need to find out where the people are who disappeared . Daniel . I know you must be disappointed in me . My superiors decided to take your family in for questioning . They 'll be home soon . - They will ? - You have my word . Grandfather too ? He isn 't well . He 's with our doctors . They 're very good . They hope to help him feel better . How about you ? You feeling better now ? Yeah , I guess so . Well , I have some news that ought to help . You 're getting promoted . To my second-in-command . - What ? - Yes . Congratulations . That 's not all . When I informed Diana of your loyalty she gave me this reward for you . - Brian ! - I 'm glad you like it . And I 'm proud to have you in my unit . You know how to use that thing ? I 'm sort of winging it . This thing controls intensity . How strong a jolt it shoots . You prime it here . - It has extra batteries ? - They 're rechargeable . - Clever , those Japanese . - Look out ! How we gonna handle him ? How about the direct approach ? Excuse me . Hello . Look , I 'm sorry to bother you , but I 'm on my way to Korea and my shrimp boat gets a flat tire so I really need an inner tube . Okay , let 's go . Go ! Go ! All right . - Same drill . - Only this time , I won 't trip . - I can 't make this stupid thing work ! - The safety 's here ! Go . Up the catwalk . Go ! Mike , my eyes ! Tony . Tony ! Okay , Roy , it 's around the corner , the second door on your left . Juliet Parrish ? Robert Maxwell , anthropology . - My daughter , Robin . - Hello . They said you were organizing here . - They did ? - Yeah . Well , come on . We 're preparing to bring down all of our equipment from the mountain camp . We 're trying to make it livable or just plain safe , at least . - Julie , where 's the water cutoff ? - I don 't know . Try that room . - I don 't think any place is safe . - You 're right . The picturesque toilets are through here . - I 'll bet . - Thi is our poor man 's BBC . The kitchen 's over there . - Robin , be careful of the elevators . - Yeah , I see the holes . Well , she 's thrilled to be here . It 's not the Galleria . She 'd go crazy at the mountain camp . A lot of good stuff up there . Electronic micro ... All of our sophisticated equipment . We gotta get it down here . - Julie , where do you want this ? - Julie , what about this ? Elias , put that in that room . Brad , over there . Robert , here . Julie , I can 't find the water cutoff . Here , let me help you . Juliet , are you all right ? Oh , Ruby . I can 't handle this . I 'm supposed to be a scientist a doctor not a plumber or a rebel . They all look at me like I know what to do . And you 're just as lost and scared as we are . More . " These are the times that try men 's souls . " I 'll tell you why we look to you . You 're a natural . A natural leader . - I don 't feel that . - You don 't have to . All you need to do is trust your instincts . Trust yourself as much as everybody else trusts you . If I can 't ? Fake it . We won 't know . How you feeling ? How would you feel ? Where 's Tony ? - She 's ready for him . - Who is ? Several times you 've caused a bit of trouble , Mr. Donovan . Nothing to the trouble you 've caused , lady . " Lady . " That 's a good one . You 'll soon have no more worries , Mr. Donovan . I 'll be with you in a moment . You know , Diana , rather than putting Mr. Donovan away he might prove very useful to us as a convert . My instincts say he 'd be too difficult . That 's why I decided not to bother . Take him to the final area . But you thrive on challenges . I do , but I like better odds . That 's curious . I would 've thought you 'd find the difficult game far more interesting . But you 're probably right . I don 't think even you with your abilities could ever turn this head of his . Martin , wait . Don 't take him to the final area just yet . Perhaps I would enjoy the challenge of converting him . Well , as you wish , Diana . - We 'll get you out of here . - You 'll what ? It 's dangerous , but no more dangerous than if you stay . You talk her into converting me and you expect me to believe you ? I was buying time , you idiot . I 'm sorry , Mike . Look some of us , a very few of us don 't believe in our leader or his plans . - What are his plans ? I can 't say now . I gotta get you out . - With Tony . - That 's impossible . - I 'm not leaving him without ... - Mike ! It 's too late for Tony . - What 'd they do to him ? - Quiet ! If that dragon lady can bend minds , why does she need a blowtorch ? Conversion is a very difficult and time-consuming operation . When Diana needs some information then she 'll do what 's most effective . And efficient . And she likes to do it . God Almighty ! Help us . Be ready . Take your shoes off . Your shoes . Hurry ! Martin couldn 't come . You 'll wear my uniform . - I 'll never ... - It 'll stretch enough to fit you . - You don 't look like an iguana . - What ? Bad taste . - Why are you doing this ? - Because it 's right . - How many more of you are there ? - Not enough , not nearly . One less if you don 't hurry . What happens next ? Take these . A shuttlecraft is on the way up now . You can slip aboard . Keep your glasses on and your mouth shut . Yeah . My voice is sure a tip-off . Can you use this ? Like the rifle , yeah ? Thanks . - All right , now shoot me . - What ? It 's necessary , or they won 't believe my story . - Will you live ? - Of course ! At least I hope so . I don 't even know your name . It 's Barbara . Godspeed , Mike . Please , do it . Do it . Trooper Units 14 and 15 to the Red Room , please . Trooper Units 14 and 15 to the Red Room . Trooper Unit 36 and Technician 31 to squad shuttle in Bay 12 , Level 1 . Trooper Unit 36 and Technician Unit 4 to squad shuttle in Bay 12 , Level 1 . No , I don 't mind the duty down there . Do you mind the duty down there ? He says he doesn 't like all those angry people . But I tell you , they don 't bother me . They bother you ? I haven 't seen you around before . What unit you with ? Nice talking to you . Aren 't you gonna say goodbye ? You hear me ? I want to hear you say goodbye . Goodbye ! Yo , Angels , come here ! Check it out , man . You hardly ever see them alone . Julie wants to study one close up . Find out what makes them tick . What say we pay the Visitor a visit ? All right . Hey , Julie ! Julie , special delivery . Pulverize him ! - Let 's get this dude . - Let him out . Be careful of his gun . Okay ... You bunch of stupid bozos ! - What are you doing ? - He doesn 't sound like one . - He 's not . - Damn right I 'm not ! - But he might be a sympathizer . - Sympathi ... I don 't suppose you have a bandage I could borrow ? Over here . Put your guns down , for God 's sake ! Who 's in charge ? I guess you 'd say that she is . Who is ? Her ? That kid ? She 's one smart kid . Are you coming ? Or would you like to keep on bleeding ? You walk with a cane . - You get hurt too ? - A little . - Where 'd you get the uniform ? - They had a sale . - You did that on purpose . - I did not . Where 'd you get the uniform ? Aboard their ship . A couple of them helped me to escape . They did ? Why ? Beats hell out of me . - Sounds like a setup . - I don 't think so . - Don 't you have any Novocain ? - I do , but I have to save it . You are a doctor ? - More or less . - That 's comforting . You don 't think it 's a setup , why ? They seemed so damn sincere . - They 'd have to , wouldn 't they ? - Look , you weren 't there , okay ? - And why were you ? - I 'm highly motivated . That 's enough ! I 'll tell you why I went up there . My kid and my ex-wife and everyone in their damn town are up there ! They got my partner up there , and God knows what they did to him . And you call me a sympathizer ? Kid , I ought to take those bandages and shove them right down your throat ! I guess we should believe you . You seem so damn sincere . That 's it . I wouldn 't , Mr. Donovan . You see , we 're also short on bandages . You have to understand our point of view . You were among the first to board their ship . You worked in close proximity with them and three nights ago you saw Kristine Walsh . You escaped from somewhere no one has escaped from , wearing ... I know what I 'm wearing . How 'd you know about Kristine ? Because I was there . Outside . - Now , you talk about a setup . - Yeah , I know , I saw it . - Why didn 't you warn me ? - I didn 't know whose side you 're on . I 'm on the right side , kid , believe me . Well ... Why don 't you tell us what you know . I 'd have to get my tape to show you , but that 's close . Reptilian . Amazing . No , not really . This could 've happened here on Earth . What ? Up to 60 million years ago the reptiles ruled the Earth . Bam , a meteor punched a hole through the crust that sent up dust and heat . - Iridium . - That 's right , iridium . Iridium was in that meteor . It kept out the light , kept in heat , like the greenhouse effect . As the temperatures went up the biggest , smartest reptiles who weren 't equipped to handle heat , like mammals are , died . So , what are you saying , man ? We just gotta turn up our barbecues and poof ! Kentucky-fried horny toad . Extra crispy . It 's not gonna be that easy , but heat can be effective as a weapon . Cold sure ain 't . The Visitor who saved me took 300 degrees below . Right , they 're equipped to handle cold . Light , bright light might be a weapon . The eating scene you described is consistent with the biochemistry of reptiles we know . Yes . Live food , or just-killed animals . What about the poison spray ? It 's not unusual for reptiles on Earth to spray their venom . From the symptoms you described , I 'd say it 's neurotoxic . It attacks the nervous system . That causes your heart to flutter and affect your lungs . Can you make an antidote ? Well , it 's possible . Procedures for creating an antivenin are standard but we need a quantity of venom . - Let 's add that to the shopping list . - Sure . Oh , God . There 's just so much ... You know what we ought to do ? Define our overall plan of resistance . - Right . - I agree with that . Well , how about this ? Firstly , to undermine all Visitor activity . Impede their progress every way we can . And secondly , I think we should find out what their hidden goals are . - Hidden ? - Sure , they 've lied to us before . And brainwashed a few of us with that process you described . It 's safe to figure there 's something deeper still going on . And thirdly , we have to find out more about their physicality . Find their weaknesses . And let people know of their reptilian nature . - That tape is important . - Yeah , I 'm hip . The more people know about how alien they are ... The more they 'll want to fight . And last , and probably the most important that we establish contact with others like us . They 're there , in every city in the world . We have to organize coordinated efforts . That 's the only way we stand a chance of winning . Robin ? Now , let 's make a list of targets to consider . Robin ? Robin ? Hold it ! Against the wall . You 're out after curfew , buddy . Another Maxwell . Brian , good to see you . We 'll talk more later , Kristine . - I need your help . - Of course . It 's come to my attention that you 've developed a relationship with this young lady . - I know her , but ... - Is she attractive to you ? Not like you are . I see now how you rose through the ranks so quickly . I 'm quite serious . That 's very interesting because I 've had my eye on you for some time . How can I be of service ? Presently . I want your help with an experiment . Medical experiment . Unusual . Involving you and her . Please , just tell me where my daughter is . Where is she ? She 's our prisoner . - In here ? - No , the mothership . - Is she all right ? - I 'm told that depends on you . - What ? - There 's some information we need . - We think perhaps you can help us . - I don 't know anything . Camp in the mountains . - I 've never heard ... - We know of its existence . We need its location . I can 't do anything about it ... It 's too bad . I 'm awfully sorry for your daughter . No , wait ! My wife , my other daughters are up there . In the mountains ? Yes . Yes . In the camp . I can 't . Oh , dear God . Come with me . I think I can help you . I understand your anguish and your dilemma . I have children too . Suppose I guarantee you the camp will not be taken until a certain time . That would enable you to get them out beforehand . You 'd do that ? I would . But if you warn the others , Robin would be quite severely ... No ! No , I won 't . But , can your people take the camp without ... ? Hey ... It can be done quite easily without harm being brought to anyone . We won 't get there until , what ? Four o 'clock tomorrow ? Yeah , okay . You have my promise . As a father . I 'll get the maps . Brian ? Just take it easy . It 's okay . It 's okay . - I won 't let anybody hurt you . - I want to go home ! I gotta hand it to you , doc . You really pulled this bunch together . You juiced them up . I 'll tell you something else , though . You better save some for yourself . Thanks . Okay , everybody . One last time . We all know our assignments then . Diversionary actions should start at 1 : 00 . - They 'll know we 're there . - One o 'clock , then . Followed by our main assault against the armory at 2 . We 've got to remember our prime objective ... To rip off as many weapons as we can get . Right . We have to arm ourselves so we can protect our equipment when we get it from the camp . Listen , while you 're breaking loose all hell here I 'll infiltrate the ship to ... - Find your family ? Hopefully . But also get a handle on their plans . That 's pretty suicidal , isn 't it ? My partner always said I should 've been a kamikaze pilot . He 's still up there . We 'd hate to lose you , Mr. Donovan . I 'd hate to lose me too . Good luck . To all of us . Let 's do it . Wait , Juliet . How about a prayer ? How about it , Caleb ? I thought that you would ... All right . Well , Lord . We really need Your help on this one . Please , help each and every one of us to do the best we can . A lot people are depending on us . That 's all . - Amen . - Amen . Amen . Let 's do it . - That 's 12 : 30 . - I know it , brother . Hurry up ! I ain 't never messed with stuff like this before . I 'd just as soon not get my hands blowed off , okay ? Now , let 's go set the others . I hate when people do that ! Boy , I 'd like to stick it in their hair ! Hey , hold on . Wait for me ! Willy ! Willy ! All right , right away ! Back onboard , everybody . There 's trouble at the plant ! Come on ! This one 's for Abraham . - Stand back . - Get the extinguisher ! Get some extinguishers ! Isolated incidence of violence mostly explosions at Visitor installations are being reported all across Los Angeles . They may be part of an effort by the scientific conspiracy . Boy , my hands are sweating . Are you scared too ? I hope we don 't have any casualties . I 'd hate to lose one of us . Hang on ! Watch for the snakes on the roof ! Guns and ammunition ! Check it out ! Let 's get it loaded first . Juliet ! I 've got to warn the camp of an attack . - What ? - I tried to protect Robin . - But too many lives are at stake ! - Robert ! - Donovan ! - What 's going on with those tanks ? - You 've been there ? - Yeah . It 's all water . Where 's the chemical ? There 's no chemical . Then what the hell are ... ? Oh , my God . That chemical 's just a smoke screen . - It isn 't what you want at all . - You 're right . You 're here to take the water . It 's the rarest , most valuable commodity you can imagine . Unlike most planets , ours included Earth is blessed with an abundance of it . We need it , Mike , for our sustenance . To power fusion generators and the leader 's weapons . - We could 've shared it ! - It was proposed . But our leader wants it all . Other ships like this one are already on their way . The plan will take a generation . But he 'll have his way . And the Earth will become a desert and humanity will die . No . There won 't be any people left by then . There 's something else I have to show you . Look I 'm sorry about the ... Where 's Grandpa ? We never saw him . What 's with your arm ? I burned it . What is this ? They 're your people . Dead ? No . Just this side of death . Metabolism slowed extraordinarily . Diana 's ... work . The people who disappeared . My son . Is he here somewhere ? Or in another ship like this one . Why are they being taken ? Stored like this ? Why not just killed ? The leader needs them living . Some of them will be made into troops for battles with his enemy . - What enemy ? - The force that defeated him before . So that makes them our friends . - I don 't know ... - It 's something to go on . You said some of them would be his troops . Not all ? - No . - What about the others ? In addition to the water there 's another basic shortage on our planet . Food . How did someone like that get to be your leader anyway ? Charisma . Circumstances , promises . Not enough of us spoke out to question him until it was too late . It happens on your planet , right ? I guess it does . How 's Barbara ? She 's recovering . This won 't be pleasant for you . Are you sure you ... ? Yeah . I 'm sure . Tony . God ... Diana ? Yes . She 's authorized some medical experiments . I want to kill her . You 're not alone . Who are you ? A friend . They tried to make me talk . But my grandfather he fought with Zapata . I tell them nothing . I spit in their faces . Where 's your friend ? There 's a hostage being used to make her father a spy . Here he comes . Get in . I don 't have time to explain . - Let 's go . - You 're coming too ? - I can 't stay here . - You ought to . - But ... - You 'd be more valuable to us here . I 've gotta fly this for you . I 'm a pilot . I 've ridden in enough of them to try . - Listen , Mike ... - Martin . Say it , man . You 're scared . It 's very dangerous for me now . And he looks like a day at Disneyland ? Barbara and Tony were scared . We 're all scared . Every damn one of us . But we 've all gotta help out in the best way we can . Now , how about it , man ? Are you game ? It 'll tend to overcompensate . The control 's are very sensitive . But if you let it , Mike , it 'll almost fly itself . I hope so . Hey . I 'm proud to be your friend . I hope we live to be old friends . Hey ! Hold it ! Hang on ! Get another fighter and follow me . If they don 't kill us , my driving might . Pull up ! Yeah , I 'm working on it . All right ! Let ' em have it , Cisco ! Sancho . Well done , captain . Their mountain camp . This should give your troops a little exercise . It 's not 4 : 00 ! They lied ! They lied to me ! Billy , get over here ! Kathleen ! Polly ! Come on , Sancho ! Nail that sucker ! I will , I will ! But I need a little luck . We 're gonna hit the mountain . Not with any luck . Where 'd you learn how to fly ? Kathleen ! Move back ! Move back ! Bring them over here ! Come on , we 've gotta stop them ! All right , get them out . We gotta save all the equipment in that building , okay ? Let 's go , let 's go ! Hurry up ! Come on ! Yes ! All right ! All right ! Here they come again ! Come on , hurry up ! Julie . Julie ! Help me ! Do something . Do something . Please ! What should I do ? Another pass . I want to get that woman . - Return to base ! - Right away . All units return to base . Kathy ! Kath . Kathleen . Oh , God ! This wasn 't going to happen . Not to anyone . I tried to fight them . Where are the girls ? Daddy ! Mama ? We fought good , huh ? Yeah . We fought good . Mr. Donovan . It 's good to see you . Yeah . You too . What did you find out ? We did it ! We saved all the equipment ! You see them run ? How about this lady ? Right in the thick of it ! Shoot ! They ain 't so tough ! - Huh ? - They ain 't so tough . Are you crazy ? We 'd better focus on destroying as many motherships as we can . Destroying ? I don 't think you get the picture , doc . There are thousands of people up there . Our people . Yes , I understand . Elias , get the trucks out ! And we will try to save as many of those people as possible ... - Try ? - Yes , try . Damn it , you 've got to understand . We may have to sacrifice the thousands to save millions , even billions . I don 't like it any more than you do . I hate it . My life has been devoted to saving lives . We may not have a choice . Brad ! Help me get the equipment out . Elias ! Get the other trucks going . Get the ammunition out first . Then the biomedical equipment . Well , it 's not the Holiday Inn but it 'll have to do . You sound like Mom . Guess I 'm gonna have to , huh ? - You still feel sick ? - Not like this morning . Every morning for the past three days in a row . Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . I 'm fine . - Was it scary up on that spaceship ? - Yeah . It was really scary . But it was also very interesting . Okay , everybody , go brush your teeth . You sound like Mom , all right . Oh , really ! That 's the most outrageous story I 've ever heard . Whether you believe it or you don 't the truth is my son , your grandson and 10,000 others are all prisoners of your " friends . " Don 't tell me you don 't know what went on in this town all week ! Of course I do . I 'm not a fool . - Then why won 't you ... ? - I 'm a survivor , Michael . Or I never would have gotten here from that Louisiana hick town or survived your father 's drunkenness . It 's not the same thing ! I 'm a survivor . If you 're going to be , you better change your ways . I know the Visitors aren 't saints . But they 're in power . They are power . You and I are in unique positions . Don 't you see that ? Why not take advantage of ... I can 't survive at the expense of other people . It 's not right . When I was a kid there was a woman who taught me what was right and what was wrong . I wonder whatever became of her . Halt ! I said , halt ! - Why have you come here ? - Please . - I have to talk to you . - You have to leave ! Our son may be here any minute , understand ? - He 's the one ... - I know . - But the Resistance needs your help . - What ? We want this to be a safe house , where we can hide occasionally . You 're out of your mind ! We 've already been arrested once . Look how he 's suffered . They tortured him . And our son is an informer ! Yes , and all of that is why this is an ideal place . Lightning 's struck here once already . Believe me , they won 't look here again . We can 't ! They only let us go so that we would warn others of what could happen . - The next time , they might kill us . - They killed Kathleen ! We 've got to stop them . I decided that it would be all right for me to die myself if millions , millions could be saved ! Oh , please ! My God , we need your help . We can 't . I 'm truly sorry . We can 't . We simply can 't ... What 's this ? My father left it for us . Read it . Read it to him . " My dear family : It 's painful knowing that I 'll not see your faces anymore . But I must take this stand for what I know is right . You may think that an old man wouldn 't be afraid to die but this old man is very frightened . I 'm hoping that I 'll find a little of your mother 's dignity and strength . So far , I 'm as frightened as a child who fears the dark . But we must fight this darkness that is threatening to engulf us . Each of us must be a ray of hope and do our part and join with the others till we 've become a blinding light triumphant over darkness . Until that task is accomplished , life will have no meaning . More than anything , you must remember which side you 're on and fight for it . Your mother and I will march beside you holding hands again . We 'll sing your song of victory . You 'll feel us in your hearts . Our spirit ... " " Our spirits will be with you always . And our love . " We have to help . Or else we won 't have learned a thing . Okay , Kenny , start it now . So that 's a call for help ? Yep , in mathematical code . If the Visitors have an enemy , they should be smart enough to translate it . How long will it take to reach them ? Depends on how far away they are . - A few years probably . - God , years ? We 're gonna keep on transmitting day and night , right , Kenny ? I hope they got their ghetto blasters tuned in on us . And if they do , let 's hope they 're on our side . So we just hang in there for a couple more years , right ? But the reality we have to face is that help may never come . We may end up having to rely completely on ourselves . We done all right . The first battle 's been won . That 's right . But the war is just beginning .

In , uh , San marcos . Where are you from , my friend ? Canoga park . L.A. L.A. ? Los Angeles . Oh , Los Angeles . Hey , could you show me where San marcos is ? I told you ... You are in San marcos . [ Chattering in Spanish ] Don 't be afraid . No tenga miedo . No tengo miedo , mis amigos . [ Chattering , yelling in Spanish ] Silencio , mis amigos . Silencio . You said ... you said ... If we bought this water from you , we would be safe . Huh ? [ Speaking Spanish ] But the devil , he is here ! We saw his red and his fire hose . You said this was a holy place , safe from Satan . Holy water ! This is a man . He is not the devil . No es diablo . Then , who is this devil man ? Where has he come from ? [ People speaking Spanish ] Jesus Christ . Two American marshalls are here . What do they want ? Marshalls ? Reese and the dorsett boys , they don 't say they 're marshalls , but they are . It 's beautiful , senor . Where did you get this map ? Got it at an exxon station . You take care of the marshalls . I 'll take care of him . Okay , but that machine stays here . God , look at that . [ Goat bleating ] [ Goat bleating ] You people some kind of cult ? A religious outfit . You know , " hare , hare . " Like that . No . Well , why do you live like this , then ? I mean , I 've been coming down to Mexico a long time , but I 've never seen a place like this . No thanks . Uh , listen , uh ... Claire . Claire cygne . Lyle . Lyle Swann . Claire , I 'm here by mistake . I don 't mean harm , and I don 't want to cause any trouble . I 'm not the law . I got no business here , and I 'm sorry for whatever it was I did that made everybody so mad . Take me back to my motorcycle , I 'll ride out of this town , and I 'll never look back . I-I don 't know what it is you people are doing . I don 't wanna know , and I won 't say a word . I 'll just ride out , and as far as I 'm concerned , this place is history . [ Cocks gun ] Take off your clothes . What ? You heard me , Mr. Swann . I do not believe this . You can 't ... [ Laughs ] I mean , a girl can 't ... I 'm very serious . You take ' em off . [ Man ] Sector 12 search is negative . Begin search sector 13 on my mark ... now . There 's no telling where that guy is . Where are you from , Lyle Swann ? How did you get here ? Why have you come here ? [ Groaning ] It 's all right , Claude . It 's Quinn . How is he ? I 'm piss poor . What the hell 's the matter with her ? Goddamn bad for business . [ Groans ] The man and the machine , he has a power . She 's acting strange . She be acting dead . She don 't shoot no dorsett . Nobody shoots no dorsett . The man and the machine , everybody 's acting strange . Two American marshalls are here . They 're asking for you by name . One was Ben Potter . Damn ! Ben Potter . Hmm . Hmm . [ Laughs ] You 're the strangest woman I 've ever met . Because I know my own mind , Mr. Swann ? Why don 't you call me Lyle ? I prefer not to . Who are you , hmm ? Where you from ? What are you doing here ? I told you , I 'm Claire cygne . I was born in Louisiana . My father was a planter . I had two brothers who taught me to shoot and ride . I went to school there . The civil war came . My brothers and my father were killed , so I left with my mother . We went to new Orleans . She died soon after . Left me with two choices ... To use my body or my gun . I chose the gun to get money to eat . There was some trouble . I heard of this place . [ Sighs ] So , I came here . The padre and me , we buy things from people ... That are difficult for them to sell elsewhere , then we sell them . The civil war ? My God , what 's happening here ? Claire , do you realize how weird everything you just said to me was ? I mean , what-what - what in the world is happening here ? You ride this machine , Mr. Swann . No one 's ever seen that before . It 's you who should be explaining . Yeah , well , um ... I started riding motorcross right out of high school . You went to school ? Can you read ? [ Laughs ] Sure I can read . Got any books ? Do you mean do I have any with me ? Yes . No , Claire , I don 't carry books with me . I have three books . Would you like to see them ? Sure . Have you read mark twain ? A little , in school . Did a report on tom Sawyer once . I haven 't read that one . You haven 't ? That 's his most famous . I only have these . You can read ? Read this . [ Chuckles ] " What might it be that you 've got in the box ? " Then , smiley says , sort of indifferent , " ' ' ' like it might be a parrot or it might be a canary maybe . But it ain 't . It 's only just a frog . ' " [ Chuckles ] [ Chuckles ] ? All I wanna do is dance and have a good time ? ? [ Ends ] " So , the fella took the box and put up his $ 40 a load with smiley ... And sat down to wait . " [ Chuckles ] Mr. Swann . [ Sighs ] What 's this ? Uh , it was my great-great ... I don 't know , way back there someplace , great-grandfather 's . My grandmother stole it from him , as a reminder of one incredible night they had together . He took off , and she went to L.A. to find him and never did . She started her own business . Nobody remembers what . At least they ain 't saying . And became the great matriarch of the Swann clan . She passed it on down to her granddaughter and on like that , till mom gave it to me when I was 21 . Anyway , it 's supposed to bring me luck . Does it work ? Does it ever . Kiss me again . [ Goats bleating ] Oh , Quinn , what do you want ? He has to leave now . The marshalls , Reese ... It 's too much trouble . That 's the best thing I 've heard . So , then he leaves . I 'm through with him . My bike . Where 's my bike ? Where the hell 's my bike ? Oh , Emil ! Bastards ! [ Groaning ] He 's alive . - Reese . - Where the hell are these cops ? Never mind . I 'll find them myself . [ Chattering in Spanish ] [ Groans ] I 'll climb up top . Yeah . [ Yelling , indistinct ] Wonder who the hell he is . I got a clean shot . What 's he carrying ? Can 't tell . Maybe he 's dangerous . - Should I let him come ? - Carrying a sidearm ? Nothing but that thing in his hand . Don 't look like no weapon . Okay , let him come . You the law ? Damn it , are you the cop or not ? [ Gunshots ] Don 't press me , boy . Padre here says you was a Marshall . If you are , I need help . If not , just tell me . Ben , I know we 're alone , except for your friend . I don 't understand what 's going on here myself . I don 't like his smart mouth . Hey , look , I 'm sorry . I lost my temper . But somebody stole my bike . - His machine . - Okay , my machine . Someone took my machine . Why you telling that to us ? Well , if you are the marshalls , maybe you could do something , before whoever took it gets too far . Can 't you get on the radio ? What ? Jesus Christ , don 't tell ... Hey , am I crazy ? Who are you people ? I want some answers . Where 's my machine ? Reese and dorsett . You know these guys ? We know ' em . Where are they ? - Swallows camp . - Swallows camp . Where is it ? [ Man ] Look . [ Chattering ] What did ya bring us , Reese ? - I didn 't bring you nothing . - Some kind of machine ? What the hell is it ? It 's mine , that 's what it is . It 's mine . [ Chattering ] Get out the way . You shoulda killed her , Claude . Bringing her here ain 't nothing but trouble . Hey , Carl . Hey , Claude . Hey , Carl , I got a present for you .

[ Chattering , shouting ] - Get out of there . - Back off . [ Man ] Settle down . Settle down , you boys . What do I do ? Well , um , first he-he put his hands on these two black thi ... Well , and then he , uh ... He jumped up and down on it . Up and down . Yeah , he jumped up and down on it , and ... Kicked it ... Right there . [ All ] Hey ! [ Man ] Kick it again , Reese . You 're gonna have to do better than that . Hyah ! [ Men laughing ] [ Man ] I don 't think it likes you , Reese . What are you telling me ? You gotta kick it harder . He kicked it real hard . [ Backfires ] That 's right , that 's right . Kick it again . Harder . Kick it . [ Man ] Stand back . [ Engine starts ] - Cut it out . - Goddamn ! Jesus Christ ! Goddamn shitheads ! Goddamn ! What are you trying to do to me ? Easy , Reese , easy . I just told you what I saw . Besides , you did real good . You made it work ... A little . You shot it . What a bunch of dumb sons of bitches . You shot it , a machine . You buttheads ! Hey , Reese , you got an arrow in it . [ Men chattering ] What a pit . How many you think there are ? Oh , 12 , maybe 15 men . Enough guns for an army . Where do you figure Reese is ? That far cabin . You think Claire is in there too ? [ Claude ] Do something to her now . I 'm gonna cut her . Ain 't no gal gonna go with a man like me ... 'Lessin ' she looks like me . Later . You told me you wanted to ... Later , Carl ! Later ! God dang it . All right , Claude . That 's it . That 's enough messin' with the woman . All right . I 'm in . I 'm with you . Now listen , I don 't know what your plan is , but ... You help me get my bike back , and I 'll get us into a " high zoot boogie " like you never saw . What 's he talking about ? You help me get my machine , and I 'll help you kick ass . Why should we trust you ? Why not ? No need to talk now , we 'll move in after dark . After dark . Hey , but what about Claire ? They 'll grind her to pieces . Well , whatever happens , will rest with you . She wouldn 't be there if you hadn 't come along . [ Blowing rhythmically ] Claude ? Stick to crime . Hey , Carl , you want some ? Thanks , Claude . [ Unzips loudly ] Energy bar . Want one ? What ? Energy bar . What is it ? Well , it 's dried nuts , fruit , no preservatives . Uh-uh . Go on , take it . You 'll like it . Good , huh ? Yeah , thanks . Don 't turn your back on those two . How far do you think it is to the cabin ? I don 't know . Can 't see a thing . Here , try this on , and look at the light on the roof of the cabin . What light ? Come on , try it on . Here , let me help you . I already told you I can 't see . What difference is a hat gonna make ? Can you see anything ? Not nothing ' . Take a look at it now . Lordy . Blessed Jesus . What the hell are you ? Trick , huh ? My wrench made this out of techno goodies out of silicon valley . Where 'd that light come from ? Cyalume . This thing stop a rifle slug ? God , I don 't know . I don 't think so . It 's not really made for that . I mean , it will handle a major get-off , but I never got shot at before today . That machine , these clothes , this here light ... Where 'd these come from ? Tinker toys , mostly . See , I hang with technoid types . We party , and they come up with all this boogie . Bike 's a bunch of jap parts . Real zoot , huh ? Cyalume from K-Mart . Shut up .

Anybody else makes a play , I 'll look for you to stop ' em . Otherwise , you stay down and stay quiet . - Is he crazy ? - Porter Reese killed ... Ben Potter 's son two years ago in San marcos . Everybody knew it was personal between ' em . - What if Reese kills him ? - Ben ain 't never been beat in a fair fight . The first mother 's son that moves other than Reese is a dead man . We 're to see to that . Get your rig . Let 's find some cover . Come on . Porter Reese ? Get out here ! You garbage ! [ Chattering ] Quinn was telling the truth . It 's Ben Potter . I want you ...

Someone drug your machine off . Billers and pig are dead . Pig 's head 's clean off . [ Breathes deeply ] That 's a yankee trick . You take this , and we 're going back down there , mister . Wait-wait a minute , hold on . This is ridiculous . It 's barbaric . You can 't just kill somebody like that . Barbaric ? What 's barbaric ? This is survival , mister . You take this . Survival ? Your friend just got blown away ! He stood up in the middle and walked right into ... Well , maybe you just don 't understand anything about honor . Honor ? Wait a minute . Take your hands off me . Okay , okay . Listen , there 's no need for any trouble between you and me . I mean , we still got to get the girl out . I don 't give a damn about that girl . Okay , I understand . I want the girl , you want Reese ... But we got to work together on this thing . Together ! [ Chattering ] What you figure , the other Marshall and the man in red ? Yeah .

 Good evening , I am Howard K. Smith . And this is the state of the war tonight . Dateline Beijing . The South China People 's Resistance has engaged the Alien Third Corps ... and fierce fighting is raging along The Great Wall , as we go to press . Meanwhile , heavy fighting is also being reported from Caracas , Venezuela ... over control of Lake Maracaibo and the many oil refineries there . Here at home , there has been no change in the stalemate ... going on in the Gila River , east of Yuma , Arizona . Paul Savage and his band of Resistance heroes ... continue to hold the wilderness high ground ... against attempts of alien armies of the west to dislodge them . This week , the Freedom Network honors Anna Horowitz ... who heroically lead a contingent of gray panthers ... into the Visitor Armory at Charleston , South Carolina ... where they reworked the control panels of 16 skyfighters ... with baseball bats before getting away . And that 's where we stand tonight . From the Freedom Network in New York , our hopes are with you . Good night . Excellent , Klaus . Whose idea was it to make her look like me ? Just a little harmless humor . Humorless harm seems closer , wouldn 't you agree , Nathan ? - This was supposed to be a test . - It was . She failed . Thank you , Klaus . You may remove the candidate . I 'll be in my office if you need me . Don 't be put off , Nathan . It was just a drone . A conscript for our personal security . You have basic training for your army , don 't you ? We don 't kill them if they don 't make it . You 're more tolerant of weakness . Which is why my people are better equipped to handle crimes ... against our legation than yours . Is that why you called me over here ? We need the right to pursue suspects anywhere in the city . I may have been born at night , Diana , but I wasn 't born last night . I 'm only asking for the right to self-defense . The right to send a goon squad into my city is hardly self-defense . Not a goon squad , a single , discreet , security officer would suffice . The answer is no . I 've seen enough discretion for one evening . The legation is your concern . The city is mine . Let 's leave it that way . These are slides taken last Tuesday of the Visitor Youth Corps . I am sorry , Mike . Looks like Sean is definitely into it . Its nothing I can 't change . Who 's that ? Klaus . The Visitors call him The Exterminator . Sounds like you 've seen him before . He worked out of Berlin when the Visitors came the first time . I had business there before I joined your group . He 's not pretty , but he is effective . So why demote him to the kiddie patrol ? Don 't be fooled . He has a purpose here . To make good little killers out of whomever they give him . - Not my son . - Don 't be dumb , Gooder . As long he has Sean , you don 't stand a chance . He 's their guru , their Zen master . Humans , runaways , aliens , he whips them all into shape . I know Sean . They 've got him on something . Mike , wait . You heard Tyler . He 's a trained killer . Right . That killer has my son . Don 't you see Diana 's just using Sean to push your buttons ? Maybe . But there are some things I can 't walk away from . Just be careful . Okay ? You surprised me , Elizabeth . I 'm sorry , it 's just that you promised I could go outside . I know . But it 's too dangerous for you , right now . There are too many Visitors out there to go taking chances just yet . I 'll be all right . I could even go alone . It 's just that I 've been cooped up for weeks . I don 't want you going alone . We 'll talk later , okay ? Hi . I just stopped by to see how you 're doing . Fine . I mean , I 'm glad you came . - Interested in taking a spin ? - A spin ? You know , I 'll give you the Bates ' tour of LA . Show you the sights . I don 't know . Come on . I got an extra helmet . Just relax . Not that relaxed . Hold on . Just , you know ... relax a little . State your business . Delivery for the kitchen . See ? Rodents . No one told me . Great , I come all this way , and no gate pass . When will you get your act together ? Just hold on . Let me check . I can 't hang around here while you scrounge up some kind of authorization . I said , hold on . Hold on , yourself . When you get it together , give me a call . Let me see them . They 're the big , furry kind . Special order for Diana . I guess the big brass are the same all over . You do the dirty work , they get the fringes . Go on . Take one . I 'll tell the chef one got away . Go on . Just remember you didn 't see this , right ? See what ? Don 't talk with your mouth full . Thanks for the ride . Can I buy you a creamsickle ? A creamsickle ? We 're gonna ride one of them now ? Come on . Quit kidding around . Orange or raspberry ? Orange . You got it . Why don 't you wait here . I 'll be right back . Come back here . Where 's your ticket ? My mother ! Where 's your ticket ? What seems to be the trouble ? She just rolled right in there without paying . Just calm down , you hear me ? Let 's check this out . Get on ! Somebody stop them ! Ready . Strike . Take your position for silent strike . In one motion , you move into the coil . Every beast of prey must master the silent strike . Remember you are one with Ravak . Do not breathe . You wait . And watch . And look for a vulnerable spot . A weakness in your opponent 's eye . Your hand is a deadly fang . So wait and strike ! Wait for it . He 's cunning . And watch for a weakness . You beat one of our own . That is almost never done . Follow me . It 's me . It 's your father . What do you want ? What do I want ? I came for you . Guards ! He 's getting away . - Let me go after him . - Yes . I want Donovan dead . You shouldn 't have come . Wrong . I 'm giving this party . - What are you doing ? - I am waxing the floor . I think we lost them . No , Dad . Klaus can find anyone . He taught you to give up pretty easily , didn 't he ? He 'll find us . He 'll kill you . - He 'll need a lot of help . - No . He won 't need any help . You 're back early , Mr. Chiang ? - Any problem with Roller ? - None , sir . He went peacefully . However there has been trouble at the Sixth Street Cinema . The young girl is reported to have displayed ... some rather extraordinary talents . Beating out three men without even laying a hand on them . How old was this girl ? Perhaps 16 . It can 't be Elizabeth . I showed you her picture . She can 't be more than 8 . It is not the girl alone that bought the matter to my attention . I 'm told in the end , she rode off with your son . I see . Now , that casts a different shade , doesn 't it ? I want you to find him , Mr. Chiang . And let me know . I have already begun . - Yeah , hello ? - Julie ? Elizabeth still hasn 't turned up . I was just calling to see if you had any better luck . I just got back from my place . She 's not there either . You don 't think the Visitors got her ? Let 's just hope she wandered off . She 's been begging me to take her out and show her the city lately . Maybe I should have listened to her . No point in blaming yourself . Ham 's doing some checking . Willie and I are on our way out too , so ... Call me the minute you hear from her , all right ? Yeah , sure . Bye-bye . - You all right ? - Sir . I mean sure . You want to tell me how you did it ? Did what ? Knocked down those guys at the theater without laying a hand on them . Did you hear that ? - Hear what ? - I 'm not sure . - It sounded like a horse . - Could be . There 's an equestrian center here in the park . Kyle , look . Have it your way . Calm down . Everything 's okay . I see you caught him . He escaped when he was being saddled . Is that so ? We 'll take him off your hands now . I don 't think so . He looks pretty spooked . I am not asking , I am telling you . We 'll take him . - All right . - Kyle , don 't let him . Let 's get them . Get it going . I want them . This house is in a safe area . Ham 'll be by a little later with some provisions . You want to tell me about that little display that I saw back there . Silent strike . It 's called Ravak . It 's like karate . No , it 's not . They 're teaching you combat aggression . Dad , it 's not like you think . Klaus is a guide . A master . He 's taught me things that have really helped . I used to get upset a lot . I 'd cry . I don 't do that anymore . It 's not wrong if you cry . I want you to feel . Things are clearer to me now . Not clearer , simpler . When you get older , you realize life isn 't that simple . Klaus says that parents confuse us . He 's right . Ravak is the way . What have they done to you ? Drugs ? - What 's this ? - Youth Corps pin . You look like you could kill me , Sean . That 's one of the tests . Many have done it . I can see the difference here . I altered the DNA pattern just a little bit and the results remain the same . Nathan , I think this can wait . Diana , I wasn 't expecting you . I 'm returning to the Mother Ship for this evening . I thought you should know that our legation was violated again this afternoon . That 'd be a change . Of course , you wouldn 't know anything about it , would you ? Dr. Parrish has been with me all afternoon . How cozy . I suppose you want me to do something about it . No , I want you to let me do something about it . The answer is still no . Then I want you to arrest Mike Donovan ... for assault with intent to kill and criminal trespass . - Donovan ? - Do you have any proof ? Or are you sending me fishing for rubber boots ? I don 't care about proof . I care about punishment . If you see Donovan , tell him that when I go fishing , I eat what I catch . I bet you do . Don 't break the law . Speaking of the law , Diana , do you still have Donovan 's son , Sean ? There isn 't no one with us who doesn 't want to be there . Nice to see you , Julie . Nathan . Remember when we took this ? The last time we were together , your mom said we were so much alike . Maybe we could ... Return to the Embassy , Sean . - You don 't have to listen to him , Sean . - Leave this to me . - Where 's your father ? - Dead . Get in . I said , get in . - Where are we going ? - Never mind . You should be glad my father 's dead . You watch your mouth when you talk about your father . - You didn 't like him . - Like had nothing to do with it . Your father and I saw things differently . - He shouldn 't have come after me . - You don 't understand , do you ? He loved you . You were his son . I 'd have done the same thing . - Thought you might like some breakfast . - Thank you . When I woke up and you weren 't here , I was frightened . There 's nothing to be scared of now . No sign of Visitors anywhere . Whenever you 're ready , we 'll take the horse back ... then go pick up my bike so I can finally get you home . I 'm sorry I keep causing you so much trouble . Forget it . You know , you 're the strangest girl I 've ever met . Strange ? You still haven 't told me how you did what you did ... yesterday at the theater . - I don 't really know . - You don 't know ? The horse must be starving . I think we better get going . I don 't want to crowd you . I just wanted you to know ... that whenever you 're ready to talk about it ... I 'm ready to listen . Thank you . Good morning . How are you ? It looks as if the young girl who created that disturbance ... in the movie theater yesterday is the same as the one spotted in the park . - Elizabeth ? - Possibly . I 've requested confirmation . I want you to remain in charge while I return to legation . - Any word from Klaus ? - None . It 's a pity your Ravak , master of discipline , displays so little himself . I 've always thought him to be an unstable personality . I 'll be sure to tell him as soon as he gets back . Would you like me to make you something in the bender ? What ? No , thanks , Willie . I 'm really not in the mood to eat . Robin , where did you come from ? - It is so good to see you . - Where have you been ? I 've been looking for you . Kyle , who I 've been staying with , said I might find you here . But I came by yesterday , and you were closed . - Not Kyle Bates ? - Yeah . Where 's Elizabeth ? Robin , there are couple of things I got to explain to you . - Something 's happened to her ? - No , nothing 's happened . She 's changed . How do you mean ? She 's not exactly a child anymore . Then what exactly is she ? She 's a beautiful young woman . It 's a really long story . Why don 't you sit down and I 'll explain it to you . - Thank you . - Thanks a lot . Some detour . I 'm sorry you had to go through this . With luck , the Visitors were so interested in finding the horse ... they left my bike alone . I just wanted to let you know ... that in a weird kind of a way I 've really enjoyed all of this . Yeah , me too . You 're really something , you know that ? You turn a movie theater into a disaster area . You walk right up to a horse I can 't get within ten feet of ... and you haven 't got the slightest idea how you do it . - I 'm sorry . - No , don 't be sorry . You 're something special . You 're the Star-child . That 's it , isn 't it ? I don 't understand , you are supposed to be eight . Your mother ... Please . I don 't want to be who I am . I thought we could just ... - Wait a minute . - Let me go . No , not until I 'm finished . Look , I don 't care who you are or what you do or where you came from . I 'm just glad you 're here and now . You 're supposed to be dead . I 'm sorry to disappoint you . What are you doing here ? I was in the safe , I was looking for you , found your kid . He told me they killed you and he hit me with something . I came looking for Klaus . I thought I 'd take him out and even the score . Thanks . I 'm still going to get my kid back . You in or out ? - Gooder , he 's going to get you killed . - Maybe . But if he was your kid ... would you let them have him without a fight ? All right , I 'll help you . - On one condition . - What 's that ? You go in my way . Donovan didn 't fortuitously escape ... he slipped right through your fingers . I am not fond of failure , Klaus . The game is not over . I will find him and eliminate him . That won 't be necessary . What do you mean ? Donovan will come to us on his own . How did you find him ? He found us . It seems that your students are more resourceful than you are . Teach me more about Ravak . Yes , Klaus . Teach him what to do when his father comes back . Two , three , four . ... ten . - Get your ass in front of the gate . - Yes , sir . Come this way with me . Come on . You go to the back . Yes , sir . You 're tenacious , Mr. Donovan . And you 're dead . No ! You can 't do it , can you ? Come to me . Don 't do it , Sean . Here 's your proof , Mr. Donovan . He 's ours . Or no one 's . Let 's go . I thought you 'd never get here . Diana won today ... but I am not giving up . Not till I get my son back . How could you be so thoughtless ? Come on . Cool out . I didn 't twist her arm . I think she wanted to come . Didn 't it occur to you we might have been going crazy ... trying to find you ? Please don 't be angry with me . You 'd better go down and let your mother know you 're all right . - My mother ? - Yeah . She found us . She 's downstairs . Mother ? It 's really you . Thank you . Sweetness-and-light here said you wanted to see me . That 's right . Thank you , Mr. Chiang . That will be all for now . He really gets around . I suppose the same could be said about you . Just looking for laughs . I want to know about the girl you were with yesterday afternoon . What girl was that ? The girl at the Sixth Street Cinema . The one who knocked the manager ... and two ushers into the middle of next Thursday . Oh , yeah , that girl . She really didn 't have much to say . That couldn 't have been the Star-child , Elizabeth Maxwell , could it ? - Dad , eight-year-olds aren 't my style . - Then who was it ? Sorry , Dad , I never kiss and tell . I don 't want any more smart remarks . I want her name and I want it right now . - Or so help me , Kyle ... - Or what ? Cut me out of your will ? Go ahead . I got no taste for blood money .

 'The year is 1987 'and NASA launches the last of America 's deep-space probes . 'In a freak mishap , Ranger 3 and its pilot , Captain William " Buck " Rogers , 'are blown into an orbit which freezes his life-support systems 'and returns Buck Rogers to Earth 500 years later . ' Leaving stargate . Destination on screen . Punching in coordinates . Engaging autopilot . - And that 's it . - That 's it . Wilma , you ought to get one of these . It 's one thing to get one , it 's another to have time to enjoy it . - What about the shuttle controls ? - They 're identical to these . You 're learning to fly two ships . Yeah . Coming up on Theta Station . Prepare for docking . - Thank goodness . - Bidibidibidi . I heard that . Are you upset because you 're not visiting Genesia ? Who , me ? The last time you and Hieronymus Fox got together , he almost punched you . Bidibidibidi . Kid can 't take a joke . You need to get your microdisc repaired and Theta Station is the best compu-facturing facility . You don 't want to blow a tube next time you 're out boogieing with Tina . Bidibidibidi . Give me a break , will you ? Buttons and controls were confusing but once I got the hang of it ... Bidibidibidi . Uh-oh ! Whoops . Bidibidi . Whee . So , I finally get to meet the Buck Rogers . Wilma 's told me so much , I feel like I 've known you for centuries . She 's warned me about you as well . Oh ? - How are you , Commander Royko ? - I 'm good . It 's nice to see you again , Wilma . Bidibidibidi . Oh . This is our ambuquad Twiki . You 'll be working on him while we 're gone . Bidibidibidi . Give me five , my man . Yes , of course . ( Twiki ) Be cool , big daddy . He 's not your average ambuquad , is he ? - No , he isn 't . - How long will he be with us ? Five days . That should be enough to repair that faulty disc . I could do it now , then you wouldn 't have to leave him . No , no . We wouldn 't want to rush you . Besides , we may get tired of Genesia . All that luxury and entertainment . We might come back early . You know what " fat chance " means ? Commander . - Station to craft . Do you read ? - How long have you been tracking it ? Since it left the stargate . I can 't seem to raise it on subspace . Keep trying . If it doesn 't change course , it 's going to hit us . Theta Station to approaching craft . Do you read ? Station to craft , come in , please . 'You are on a collision course for Theta Station . 'Modify your course and acknowledge . 'Approaching craft , please acknowledge . ' It 's gonna hit . Divert power to the meteor deflectors in sectors G , H and I. Secure the sectors . 'Alert ! Collision imminent ! Evacuate sectors G , H , I. 'Collision imminent ! Alert ! ' Stand by for impact . All Code Red units move to sector H with emergency equipment . 'Emergency ! Code Red units report to sector H . ' It 's embedded itself ! Our exterior hull has a self-repairing core . We 're in no danger of losing our atmosphere to space . However , internal atmospheric integrity has been lost . Which means the air from that ship is mixing with ours . All we can do is assess the damage . - You need any help ? - All I can get . You 've got it . Doc . Casualties ? None . The sector was cleared just in time . Dr Ecbar , Colonel Wilma Deering , Captain Buck Rogers . - Any life forms aboard ? - I can 't be sure of my readings . Could be a magnetic field interfering . The best thing we can do is take a look . If you 're afraid of contamination , we 've already been exposed . - We have nothing to lose by going in . - You 're right , of course . Put this on . Twiki , you wait here till we get back . You don 't have to tell me twice . Class-G cargo freighter , about 20 or 30 years old . This must be the crew 's quarters . The bridge must be above us and to the right . Hold it . - Servo-drone . - We 'll pick it up later . Let 's go . The hull seems to be secure . Here we go . Doc , number one . Here 's number two . Doc , take a look at this . We found number three . I found a whole sickbay full of bodies back there . Do you think a disease is responsible ? I 'll have to declare a quarantine . Until we know what we 're dealing with , no one leaves or enters the station . - I 'm sorry Buck . Wilma . - We understand . Well , by the looks of things , she was the last to go . Maybe this will tell us what happened . ( Tape rewinds ) 'This is the log of the IS Demeter , bound for Tazwell 'with eight crew , one passenger . 'Returning from Deneb V , having delivered a shipment of barbarite . 'Log update . 52 hours from Stargate 9 . 'The passenger , Helson , has been found dead in his quarters . 'Cause of death unknown . 'His servo-drone , a personal data storage unit , 'was found beside him , deactivated . 'Update , 37 hours from Stargate 9 . 'Three crew members are dead . Cause unknown . 'The rest of the crew is tense . Irritable . 'We 're experiencing some power shortages . No explanation . '24 hours from stargate . Two more dead . 'They exhibited bizarre behaviour and suffered hallucinations . 'The paramed thinks the deaths are due to EL-7 , 'although I 'm certain we decontaminated properly . '17 hours from stargate . The paramed 's dead . 'There are only two of us left and we 've got to stick together . 'I 've set the autopilot for Stargate 9 . 'It 's the only thing we can do . 'Pierson is dead . And now it 's after me . 'I think it 's coming . Stay away ! 'Please ! Who are you ? 'No ! Please , no ! ' What is EL-7 ? A virus . It was rampant in the Deneb system till they discovered a vaccine . It 's highly contagious and works fast . Fever , mental deterioration , hallucinations , convulsions ... death . She wasn 't hallucinating . She was terrified . - What do you say , Doc ? - I 'm sorry ? - Do you think it is EL-7 ? - I can 't tell without running more tests . But we 'd best assume the worst . I have serum here to counteract the virus , but I 'll need more . If it 's not already too late . Start inoculating with what you 've got . I 'm going to contact Earth for more serum . Hey ... Wilma , are you OK ? Mm-hm . Fine . Why don 't you get something to eat ? I 'll join you later . Sure . Go pick up that servo-drone and take it back to my cabin . Try to get it working again . Maybe it can tell us what went on on the Demeter . - I 'd better start the inoculations . - Wait . You aren 't telling us everything . - It sounds ... - Crazy ? Doc , no virus works that fast , and you know it . Now , tell me . The people on this ship are not dead . They 're not alive , of course , but they 're not dead either . It 's as if their spirit ... the energy force , if you will ... is drained from them . These discolorations . They 're on all the bodies . You 're saying they 're victims of some kind of vampire ? - Vampire ? I don 't understand . - I 'm not sure I do either , Doc . It doesn 't like me . That 's all there is to it . If it 's possible for a botanical organism to feel , then this plant knows hate . Come now , Doctor . Surely you 're overstating the matter . No , I don 't think so . I 've fed it , I 've watered it , I 've done everything that Buck told me to do . I 've even begun to talk to it . And this is how it shows me its gratitude . 'Subspace message coming in from Theta Station , Dr Huer . ' That must be Buck and Colonel Deering . You 'd better hide the plant . Good heavens ! 'Hello , Buck . Colonel Deering . Are you enjoying your trip ? ' Not quite , Doc . We stopped over on Theta Station to drop Twiki off . Now the whole place has been quarantined for something called EL-7 . 'EL-7 ? ls the station 's medical complex working on a vaccine ? ' There 's some on the way . Doc , would you do me a favour ? The quarantine was caused by the IS Demeter hitting the space station . There 's something not kosher about it . A small drone in the freighter was shut down for some reason other than EL-7 . Twiki 's trying to repair it now . The drone belonged to a passenger named Helson - William Helson , of New London . Could you run an ID scan on him and get the data back ASAP ? - No problem at all , Buck . - ' Great . 'You can contact us through Royko 's office . Rogers out . ' If you have no objections , I 'll take you to the data banks for that information . No objections at all , Dr Huer . Oh . If I might make a suggestion , perhaps you 'd consider having an agro-drone come and look at your rather depressed piece of flora ? Dr Theopolis , I 'm surprised at you . Buck left that plant in my care . Bringing in an agro-drone would be a blatant admission that I can 't cope with Buck 's 20th-century naturalism . Yes , sir . When would you like the drone to look at it ? Immediately . How do you like your food discs - fried or saut√©ed ? - Not very hungry . - I can 't say I blame you . Sauteed food discs are not my cup of tea either . That 's the fourth joke you haven 't smiled at . You 're destroying my self-confidence . I 'm sorry . I don 't understand why I feel this way . Ever since we entered that freighter , for the first time in my life , I could feel death as a tangible presence . I wasn 't going to say anything about this till we had more evidence , but Dr Ecbar feels those bodies on board that ship are not really dead . He thinks they 're in cellular suspension . I think a being , not a disease , is responsible . Maybe that 's what you 're picking up . - Or maybe the effects of EL-7 . - Don 't start thinking like that . I 'll get you another drink . Here we go . What ? This is Dr Ecbar . Please have Commander Royko join me at sickbay . What are you doing here ? Who are you ? Who are you ? Aahh ... Go away ! Dr Ecbar just paged me . You care to join me ? Sure . - Oh , my God . - Ls he dead ? The disease must have killed him after he called for me . He may have been attacked . Look at his body . He died of cellular disruption like the others . How do you explain the discolorations ? I can 't . Neither could he . He told me about your theory . Vampires ? Keep them to yourself , Captain . Your passenger Helson was a bounty hunter from Cygnus V , specialising in alien fugitives . Could make a lot of enemies . 'Yes . Here 's the curious part . 'He only became a bounty hunter in the last five years . 'Before that , he was an agro-station farmer 'until his wife and family died under rather mysterious circumstances . ' How , er ... mysterious ? 'They died in a shuttle accident . Their bodies were never recovered . 'Helson was the only survivor . He was tried and acquitted for their murder . 'Afterwards , he vowed vengeance on what he said killed them . 'Something called a Von / on . ' ( Buck ) Vorvon ? What kind of language is that from ? 'Dr Theopolis is continuing his computer search . ' 'Thanks , Doc . Try to get back to us as soon as possible , OK ? 'Rogers out . ' I can 't get over it . The agro-drones told me there was no hope for that plant , but you 've managed to nurse it back to full health . I didn 't know you had it in you . Yes . Well , thank you . You , er ... purchased a new one , didn 't you ? Yes , I did . Well , one philodendron looks rather like any other philodendron . - At least I certainly hope so . - Let 's hope Buck thinks so . Helson may be the key . I 'm going to see how Twiki 's coming along with those repairs . He may be able to tell us what happened to the crew on the Demeter . - You OK ? - I was thinking ... Buck , have I been acting rationally ? Of course you have . You don 't have EL-7 . There has to be another explanation . A psychotic killer ? I think I 'd prefer EL-7 . That 's the Wilma I know . I 'm glad you think so . I 'm not even sure I recognise myself . Boo ! Bright , Twiki . Really bright . Bidibidibidi . I 'm sorry , Buck . Apology accepted . Did you get this thing fixed ? - Yep . I got the little twerp fixed . - How does it work ? Top button on the left . - Now we 're getting someplace . - We are ? This has to be the last thing the drone recorded . 'So , after all these years we meet face to face , Von / on . ' - Bidibidibidi . Who 's he talking to ? - Quiet , Twiki . - ' You killed my family . ' - He 's hallucinating . Royko was right . It was EL-7 . 'But ... Aagh ! ' - That wasn 't an hallucination . - ' If you die , I die . Aagh ! ' - He sure wasn 't killed by the flu . - He certainly wasn 't . He was murdered . By something invisible to electronic surveillance . A Vorvon ? He was using something to ward it off . I 'm gonna find it . I 'll be right back . Bidibidibidi . I hope so . ( Rattling ) ( Banging ) You stand between me and something I want very much . Don 't worry . This won 't be very painful . ( Screaming ) Take it from him ! ( Hisses ) ( Alarm ) ( Hisses ) Take it easy , Buck . You 're all right . Hey . Don 't try to sit up . How do you feel ? Oh ... Like I just went the distance with Muhammad Ali . They 're here . Ecbar and the people from that ship attacked me . You were attacked by corpses ? None of them are really dead . Ecbar was right . Something is draining their souls . Making them into puppets . Commander , I must be bruised over every square inch of my body . Are you saying that I hallucinated a fight with these people ? Convulsions and blackouts are pretty common with EL-7 . Twiki ! He can bring that servo-drone . We 'll play its recording for you . Bidibidibidi . Uh-oh . Oh , no . He got to it . Bidibidibidi . I only left it for a minute . You can believe what you want . I don 't really care . All I want right now is an aspirin . I 've got a headache down to my toes . He 's asking for a painkiller . I 'll get it . Look , Buck , I 'm responsible for this station . I 've got 100 people under me . It 's my job to know what 's going on around here . EL-7 is the only thing that makes any sense . I 'm going to contact Earth again . Maybe Dr Huer can come up with something else that makes sense . OK . You do that . I 've got some unpleasant work to do . They discovered three bodies in sector G. - What 's that ? - If my hunch is right ... the 25th-century equivalent of a cross . - I 'm going back to my cabin . - I 'll go with you . It 's all right . I 'll be fine . I 'll meet you later in the lounge . OK . 'According to Dr Theopolis , 'the word " Vorvon " originated on a planet in the Romaine star system . 'It refers to a ... ' Spit it out , Doc . I asked for it , remember ? 'Yes . Well , it refers to a half-dead creature 'who drains the living soul from its victims . ' - Space-age vampire . - ' It 's only a myth , you know . Don 't I wish ? Did you come up with anything about this ? Yes . It 's an ancient power lock . Legend says it 's the only thing that will ward off the Vorvon . - But it doesn 't seem to be a legend . - ' No , it doesn 't . 'I 've seen it , Doc . ' That 's him . 'It 's said that it only appears in this form to its intended victims . 'Buck , I 'm going to dispatch a fighter squadron to Theta Station . ' They 'd get here too late . - I can hardly sit here while you ... - Doc , there just isn 't time . According to legend , is there any way to destroy this creature ? 'The power lock can hurt it 'but the only thing that can destroy it is a tremendous power overload . ' Like Dracula couldn 't stand the light of day . 'Creating an explosion that large on a space station is out of the question . ' Light of day ... Doc , I 've got an idea . - ' I was rather hoping you 'd say that . ' - Rogers out . I 've had better conversations with a roto-rooter . ( Buck ) All right . To leave , Mr Vorvon , you 'll have to take the first ship in launch position . This one . When you do , you 're gonna be in for a little surprise . They don 't call them " stargates " for nothing . Bidibidibidi . Now What ? I 've come for you . - What 's with you ? - Don 't you see him ? I want you . - See who ? - ( Vorvon ) You 're the only one I want . Twiki , can 't you hear him ? I 'll kill them all ... to get you . No ! Leave them alone ! Leave me alone ! Bidibidibidi . Wilma ! Buck ? Buck ? Buck ? You may come to me now . No ! ( Wilma ) Aagh ! Buck ! Royko ! Buck ! Royko ! Buck ! Now you 're all mine . Stay away from her ! Wilma , watch it ! Drop it , Buck . - Commander , I ... - Drop it . - Commander ... - Stay there . - The creature ... The Vorvon ... - It was after me ! Buck scared it off . I 'm sorry , Buck . I know it 's not your fault . It 's the virus . But you 're becoming dangerous . I can 't have you running around loose . If you lock me up , it will kill all of us . You don 't understand what you 're doing ! Commander , listen to me ! Please , this is serious ! Please ! Commander , you 're making a mistake . He was telling the truth . Something did attack me . I 'm sure you believe that . I 'm really sorry , Wilma , but your friend has become a danger to us all . And so have you . I 'm not going to lock you up with him . But I will have to confine you to quarters . Sure . Maybe I am dreaming all this . I don 't know . Maybe it is up to me to end this nightmare . Come on . Let 's get some rest . It 's OK , Buck . It 's only a sedative . It 'll make you feel better . Commander , before you use that thing , just do me one favour . Just one . Please talk to Dr Huer . Just talk to him . That 's right . There 's no need to run . You 'll let them go ? Buck ? Royko ? You won 't hurt them ? Once I have you , I 'll need no one else for a long , long time . ( Deep and husky ) Buck ? - Buck , can you hear me ? - Wilma ! You 're all right ! There is an alien on board . A Vorvon . I know . Wilma ... - How did you get past the guards ? - I drained them . Stole their essence . It felt so good . It was so easy . Wilma , no ! Oh , yes . Plead with me . I like the taste of fear best of all . Aagh ! You tricked me ! Wilma , please . Let me help you . I don 't want your help . I like being this way . - I 'm gonna stay this way . - Wilma ... I failed . Buck knows about us now . What are we going to do ? Nothing more we can do . There are other worlds . Ripe , living worlds that could be ours for the taking . Think of it . Millions of souls withering in your hands . Remember how sweet their fear can taste ? How strong it makes you feel ? Yes . Oh , yes . - What happened to her ? - The Vorvon got to her . Come on . Wait . I may need this . ( Hisses ) Let 's go . Wilma ! We 're going to need reinforcements . Come on . So much for reinforcements . Let 's go . - You know how to operate the ship ? - Yes . He showed me how . Considerate of him , wasn 't it ? 'Security to corridor 12 , sector A . ' - They 've gone . - We 've got to stop them . - I 'll send a squadron after them . - I booby-trapped my ship . If we don 't stop them before the stargate , they 'll both die . - Starfighter in pursuit . The fools . - Destroy it . - It could be Buck . - I said destroy it ! ( Von / on ) No . No . No ! Aaagh ! What 's happening ? Wilma , can you hear me ? - I 've lost control of the ship ! - I pre-programmed the computer . 'You 're gonna crash if you don 't hit the separate switch . 'You 'll have 20 seconds to get into the shuttle compartment . Now , hurry ! ' Buck , it 's been a nightmare . - I feel so ashamed . - Forget it , Wilma . It 's over . Let 's go home . For a man just back from the undead , you 're looking good , Doc . 'Thank you , I think . 'When the Vorvon was destroyed , 'his victims were freed from cellular suspension . 'I feel like that Lazarus person you told me about , Buck . ' Thank you for checking in . I 'll speak with you later . Huer out . Well , I don 't know about you people , but I 'm stewed . - If you 're interested , dinner 's on me . - Thank you . - We 'd love to . - Good . - There is one thing I 'm curious about . - What is it ? How did that India-rubber plant turn into a Ficus benjamina ? I 've been raising plants for years and I 've never been able to do that .

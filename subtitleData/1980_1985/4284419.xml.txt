 Soon our fight for independence will be over . What about Teddy Roosevelt and the Rough Riders ? I 'm afraid you 've got your facts mixed up , son . He was the 22nd victim of Billy the Kid . What ? BILLY : Throw that shotgun down . How dare you terrorize innocent people . You haven 't heard the last from me . ( WHISPERS ) Looks like we found him . Please don 't do this , Mr. Roosevelt . We will draw our guns and the best man will be left standing . The way I see it , he 's no man at all . Bogg , look out ! BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! MANUEL : We must hurry . We have to reach the jungle before the Spanish soldiers come . RITA : What about the Americans ? The Spanish will capture them . Forget the Americans . Worry about your own people . You didn 't talk like that when the Americans first arrived . Then , they were your brothers . Then , they weren 't defeated . Besides , those two you want to go back for aren 't even soldiers . They are newsmen , here to report the spilled blood of the Cubans . The war has turned you cold , Manuel . If you won 't go back with me , then I 'll go alone . Rita ! Let her go . She has made her choice . ( PLUMMETING ) Where are we , Bogg ? Someplace with bombs . Let 's find cover . ( CHICKENS CLUCKING ) Oh ! That was a close one . You can say that again . ( BEEPING ) Red light ? What else ? Cuba , 1898 . Cuban Revolution against the Spanish . Hey , this is where Teddy Roosevelt led his charge up San Juan Hill . ( RITA SCREAMING ) ( MUMBLING INCOHERENTLY ) She 's gonna get hit . I 'm going after her . You stay put . Okay . BOGG : Over here ! No , no . ( STAMMERING ) Look , I 'd like to talk , but I think we better get out of here . Come on . Are you two okay ? I 'll let you know when my ears stop ringing . Those bombs can really do a number on your eardrums . You are very brave . It 's all in a day 's work . My name is Rita . Cuban ? Yes . You two Americans ? I am . Bogg here 's sort of international . The bombs are Spanish ? Advance artillery . The soldiers will come next . I take it the Spanish are winning . Yes , soon our fight for independence will be over . My people have suffered long enough . They cannot go on much longer . What about Teddy Roosevelt and the Rough Riders ? Who ? Teddy Roosevelt ? I do not know him . Oh , no . ( WHISPERS ) Didn 't he work for the government ? Not yet , he was in Cuba before he became president . Are there any American soldiers here ? No , they have all retreated . ( TRUMPETS PLAYING ) Shh . The bombs have stopped . Great . It 's terrible . The trumpets mean the soldiers will come next . We better get moving ... No , first , you must help me . There are two Americans in town who will be captured if we don 't get them out of here . I thought you said they all retreated . These are newsmen . They stayed behind . Newsmen ? Bogg , if anybody knows about Roosevelt , they will . Do you know where they are ? Yes , I was going to them right before the bombs started . Let 's go now , just in case they come back . REMINGTON : Where are my sketches ? Is that all you artists care about ? We 're in major trouble here . Can you move your legs ? No . I don 't know if I can move this stuff by myself . ( CHUCKLES ) My luck . I 'm in mortal danger and the only one here to help me is a writer . Great , make jokes . The next one better be in Spanish . Rita ! Thank God ! What happened ? A bomb hit , the roof collapsed right on top of him . All right . Come on , everyone , we 'll have to lift together . ( GRUNTING ) It 's no use . I once knew an old man who said he could move the world if he had a large enough lever . Archimedes ! That 's the guy . Find me a fulcrum . ( REMINGTON GROANS ) Don 't worry , we 'll get you out . When I lift it up , slide him out . Right . JEFFREY : Easy . Easy . You got it ! Yeah . RITA : That 's good . Lift him gently . Come on . My sketches ! You have to understand my friend , he 's an artist . He can 't appreciate it when someone saves his life . But I 'd like to thank you . My name is Davis , this is Remington . No time for thanks right now . We 'd better get moving before the Spanish soldiers get here . I know of a safe place . A barn outside of town . Come on . Those are pictures of our defeat at San Juan Hill . RITA : If you are not a soldier then why are you in Cuba ? Me and the kid are just sort of travelers . We go all over the place . Is he your son ? I wish he was . I just sort of watch after him . You know , like a guardian . Are you married ? ( CHUCKLES ) No . I 've thought about it , a lot . But in my line of work I never stay anyplace long enough to really get to know anyone . Sounds lonely . It is sometimes . But I have the kid and he 's a good friend . Friendship is nice , but it doesn 't compare to the love of a woman . No kidding . Maybe a special woman could convince you to settle down . Well , I 'm willing to have her try . JEFFREY : This is all wrong . Just what I need , another critic . No , I mean the scenes . This isn 't the way it 's supposed to happen . Yeah . Well , that 's what Hearst keeps saying , but I draw the truth . What happened to the Rough Riders ? The Rough Riders ? Yeah , I think they were the first volunteer cavalry group from somewhere out west . Yeah . Texas and Oklahoma . But that bunch got left in Tampa . Teddy Roosevelt , too ? Teddy Roosevelt ? ( SCOFFS ) That rich kid from New York ? He 's not a kid . He 's the colonel in charge of the Rough Riders . I 'm afraid you 've got your facts mixed up , son . Yeah , Roosevelt went west in the summer of 1880 . After he graduated college ? And got himself shot . What ? Yeah , he was the 21st or 22nd victim of Billy the Kid . I did the drawing for the pulps . And that was one of my best sellers . In fact , I think I have a copy of it in here somewhere . Yeah , here it is . " An Easterner Meets Western Justice . " Your people have been fighting for a long time , haven 't they ? Yes . Since I was a young girl . Now , I think it 's finally over . War is very strange . It seems to tear people apart and bring others close together . Yeah . When I see all the pain around me , I just want to reach out to someone for warmth and tenderness . I know just what you mean . Bogg . Bogg ! Bogg , this is real important . Don 't move , I 'll be right back . When you get older , you 're gonna discover what 's really important . I found Teddy Roosevelt . What 's this ? Shot 18 years ago by Billy the Kid . Who 's Billy the Kid ? Are you kidding ? He 's only the most famous outlaw of the Old West . I dressed up like him three Halloweens in a row . Wait a minute . Maybe I have heard of him . Didn 't he shoot a lot of people ? Twenty-one . Now come on , we gotta get there . What about Rita ? You know the voyager code . No romance while the Omni 's red . There 's no code like that . ( BEEPING ) Well , there should be one . At least let me say goodbye to her . Come on . Come on . Up , up . Let 's get on up . Up , up . Oh , dear . Up , up . Oh , dear . ( PLUMMETING ) You could have at least let me say goodbye . Are you kidding ? I 've seen your goodbyes . We didn 't have all year . This doesn 't look like the Old West . And that guy can 't be Billy the Kid . ( BEEPING ) Pennsylvania , 1752 . That 's not what I set the Omni for . Sometimes it gets stuck in the automatic mode . Well , if this is Pennsylvania , 1752 ... Who 's the guy with the kite ? Ben Franklin ! Come on . Mr. Franklin ? Oh , no . Don 't tell me you two have been witnessing this folly . Yeah , it looks like you 're having a little trouble . I 'm having a confounded time getting it off the ground . You 've got a good wind . Yes . There is a storm brewing . That is , if my barometer was accurate this morning . I 'm conducting this experiment to prove that lightning is charged with two kinds of electricity . Well , don 't worry , Mr. Franklin , your experiment will be a success . You 're a great inventor . Well , I don 't know about being a great inventor , but I ... I 'm not a very good kite flyer . This is hopeless . Well , I know why the kite won 't fly . Why ? It 's too heavy . This key is weighing it down . Well , the key acts as a conductor . Yeah , Bogg , he 's gotta have that key . Well , we 'll just have to shorten the tail a little bit to make up for the extra weight . There you are . Yeah , that ought to do it . Hold this for me . Oh , I 'll handle this . I 'm the expert . Okay . Ready ? Uh-huh . Run , Jeffrey ! Good . FRANKLIN : Now up , up , up . That 's it . That 's it . That 's it . He 's got it . He 's got it . He did it . He did it . You 're doing it , kid . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) Just in time , too . Here you are , Mr. Franklin . Thank you very much , young man . I 'm very grateful . Now all I need is a bolt of lightning . Green light . Let 's try Billy the Kid again . Okay . ( PLUMMMETING ) ( EXCLAIMS ) Jeffrey ! Bogg , help ! Hold on , Jeff . I 'm coming . Bogg , I 'm sinking . It 's quicksand . I know . I 'm stuck , too . BILLY : What are you doing down there ? Looks like you guys got yourselves in quite a mess . Well , don 't just sit there , do something . Bogg ! Don 't move , Jeffrey . It makes you sink faster . Hey , come on , mister , give us a hand . The kid 's gonna sink . Come on , will you ? Bogg . Hold on , Jeff . Hold on . JEFFREY : Bogg . Back . Back , boy . That 's it . That 's it . Keep going , boy . ( PANTING ) That was great . How 'd you rope us like that ? Easier than roping a running stallion . I 'm Jeffrey . This is Phineas Bogg . William Bonney . It 's Billy the Kid ! You dressed like him for Halloween ? It was an easy costume . Just be glad he had some extra clothes with him . We better hang around with him a while . He might lead us to Roosevelt . How did you fall into that sand , anyway ? It 's a long story . Where are your horses ? They ran off . Must have got wind of some wild mustang filly . Happens out here all the time . You must know all about horses and roping and stuff . Them that don 't , don 't live long . I 've read about you , Mr. Bonney . You 're famous . Call me Billy . And don 't believe everything you read in those magazines . I ain 't killed half as many men as they think . They just make up stories about you because you 're a legend . You 're laying it on a little thick , don 't you think ? I 'm a legend , am I ? Yeah . I 'll tell you what . Since you two ain 't got horses and I do , you want to ride with me ? All right ! Mount up . Good job , kid . I didn 't know what you were going for at first , but you really conned him into taking us with him . Who was conning ? You mean you really think this guy is a legend ? Bogg , he 's Billy the Kid . Right , the murderer . You heard him . He hasn 't shot half the people they say he has . One is too many . Okay , okay . But maybe he shot them in self defense . Maybe they were murderers . Maybe they weren 't . We 're gonna stop here for a spell . Why ? I 'm waiting for my men . ( SNAKE RATTLING ) Look out ! Wow ! That was fast ! I wish I could do that . You mean you haven 't learned to shoot yet ? I 've never even picked up a gun before . Well , not a real one at least . Then I 'm gonna show you how . I got some tins of beans in my saddle bags . Make good targets . Wait a minute . I don 't think that 's a good idea . He 's gotta learn sometime . He can 't survive out here without knowing how to use a gun . Come on , Bogg . Would you excuse us a minute ? Bogg , how many kids get the chance to learn how to shoot from Billy the Kid ? None , I hope . We 're just gonna be shooting tin cans . No way . Please , Bogg , it 'll be a good experience . I said no ! That 's final . Here you go . Try your hand at it , kid . I can 't . Why not ? Bogg won 't let me . Hey , I don 't want to get between a boy and his father . He 's not my father . But he tells you what to do ? Look , I take care of him , I just don 't want him to shoot a gun . Hey , that 's okay by me . Except when I was Jeffrey 's age , I was on my own . I learned how to shoot . And after that no one told me what to do . We heard some shooting . Figured it might be trouble . No , no trouble , Charley . Just showing off a little . Ned , Coley . This is Jeffrey and that 's Bogg . Hi . They 'll be riding with us . Did you forget we 've a stagecoach coming through in an hour ? No one said anything about extra splits on the divvy . Now they stay behind . Are you taking over , Charley ? What , you guys been planning something behind my back ? No , Billy , I swear , we ain 't planned nothing . He 's telling the truth , Billy . A man have to be crazy to cross you . Now that 's the smartest thing you ever said , Charley . And it just saved your life . Okay , everybody mount up . We 've got a stagecoach to rob . Billy 's got himself a mean temper . Yeah , well , I 've seen you lose yours before . Not like that . Hey , wait a minute . We can 't go along on a stagecoach robbery . You want to find Teddy , don 't you ? We 've gotta stay with Billy . All right , but we have to stay out of it . We can 't get involved in a hold-up . Will you stop treating me like a kid ? I know what I 'm doing . That kid 's asking for it . ( YELLS ) Whoa ! BILLY : Hold it right there ! Take it easy . And you throw that shotgun down . Here , you keep an eye on it . Take the gun , Jeffrey . I need you to keep an eye on the passengers . You touch that gun and you 'll find yourself in an orphanage in another time zone . Suit yourself , kid . Ned , get the money bag . Oh , my ! Oh , my ! First Indians , now outlaws . This is an awful place . There , there , Maggie . Everything is going to be just fine . Oh , Mr. Roosevelt . ( WHISPERS ) Looks like we found him . Yeah . Who 's in charge here ? Who 's the leader of this gang ? I guess you could say I am . You 're gonna die , mister . How dare you terrorize innocent people . You don 't understand me . You are gonna die , right here , right now , in front of all these people . Nobody hits Billy the Kid and lives to brag about it . So , you 're Billy the Kid , are you ? You 're even less impressive in person . Kind of puny , if you ask me . You 're asking to die . Charley , give him your gun . Take it . The unwritten code of the West , huh ? Okay to shoot a man with a gun in his hand ? I have nothing but disgust for you and all outlaws like you . Put it in his hand , Charley . It 's very kind of you , Charley , but no thanks . If Billy wants to shoot me , he 'll have to do it in cold blood . No ! Okay , if that 's the way you want it . ( GUN FIRING ) My finger slipped . I guess I got kind of tense . It 's been one of those days . Let 's get out of here , Billy . This guy 's not worth it . You 're a legend . Legends don 't shoot unarmed men . Yeah ? Yeah . Yeah , okay , kid . Today , I 'll be a legend . Okay , boys , load them up . Watch your step , Maggie . This is your lucky day . You haven 't heard the last from me , William Bonney . Please , Mr. Roosevelt . You don 't want to die . Just get in the stagecoach . Please . Okay , son . But you should be more careful about the friends you choose . MAGGIE : Mr. Roosevelt , let 's go back to New York where we belong . Hey , move them out . Go back into town and see if that yellow-bellied Sheriff 's got a posse out after us . You came through , kid . I knew when it came down to it , you would . Now do you think Billy is such a big hero ? I knew he wouldn 't shoot him . I told you he 's not as bad as you think he is . After what you just saw ? Look , I don 't care now . We saved Roosevelt and now we can get out of here . ( BEEPING ) It still can 't be red . I guess we just gotta stick around a little bit longer . Mr. Roosevelt ? Yes , Maggie . I 've been your housekeeper now for five years . And in all that time I 've tried to keep my nose where it belongs . Yes , Maggie , you are a wonderful woman . Please , Mr. Roosevelt , let 's get out of this town and go back east . Right now , right away . We 've just arrived . I know , and already we have been attacked by Indians , and you have almost been shot by a dangerous outlaw . That 's exactly why we can 't leave . I don 't understand . You can 't expect me to leave when an outlaw like that roams free . You know my stand on law and order , Maggie . I won 't rest till that man is behind bars . But you don 't even live here . We are all citizens of the world , Maggie . Every person has an obligation , no matter where he is , to keep the peace . Mr. Roosevelt , you can 't fight this outlaw by yourself . He 's a killer . This town has a sheriff , doesn 't it ? And good , upstanding citizens . I won 't be alone , Maggie . No , I will unite this town into one large peace-keeping force . Mark my words . Billy the Kid is finished . That man is gonna get himself killed . SHERIFF : I can 't believe that the Kid didn 't shoot you . Well , he shot others for a lot less . I have a young boy to thank for that . He talked Billy out of it , and I must say he convinced me not to be so bullheaded . What you did wasn 't bullheaded . It took real courage . Sheriff , I 'm a man who believes in law and order . I 'd rather die than see outlaws like that take over . I felt the same way , but when I was younger . But now , I wouldn 't stand a chance against someone like Billy . You don 't have to stand alone , Sheriff . Not when you have good citizens that cherish peace and justice . If you give me the authority , I 'll round up a posse and go after that outlaw . I 'll end his terrorizing once and for all . Oh , I 'll give you the authority , but I don 't know how easy it will be to round up a posse . People around here like peace , but when it comes to justice , they 'd rather someone else take care of it . You underestimate them , Sheriff . Good citizens of this community , can I have your attention please ? ( ALL CHATTERING ) Good citizens of this community , you have , no doubt , all heard by now about my confrontation with Billy the Kid . The sheriff has authorized me to organize a posse to go after this cowardly vermin and put an end to his murderous reign , once and for all . I call for volunteers . ( ALL CHATTERING ) Looks like I 'll have to handle this by myself . I don 't know if I should 've let that fellow get away with what he done . You did the right thing , Billy . You gotta understand something . I stay alive because people are too scared to mess with me . It ain 't good people knowing I got hit and didn 't do nothing about it . It wouldn 't have proved anything by shooting an unarmed man . Yeah , maybe not . But it sure would have been a lot easier if you had taken that gun . I gotta check the horses . You still like that guy after what he did yesterday ? Roosevelt hit him . In front of all those people . Oh , that 's good reason to shoot somebody . He didn 't shoot anybody . He stopped because I talked him out of it . Yeah , well , who says you 're gonna be able to stop him next time ? I 'm starting to worry about you . I thought you were smart . I am smart . So why don 't you just lay off the lectures , okay , Bogg ? Probably found himself another stagecoach to rob . I 'm gonna go check it out . It 's a good thing you sent me into town . That Sheriff ain 't doing nothing but that Roosevelt fellow sure is stirring up trouble . What kind of trouble ? He 's been in town all morning trying to get up a posse . And , last night in the saloon , he called you a coward . I knew I should 've taken care of him . What 's going on , Billy ? I gotta go into town to get some supplies . You wanna come ? I gotta ask Bogg . Yeah , if you do , what will he say ? No . But if I don 't , he 'll clobber me . Look , if you have to ask just to go for a little ride , then maybe I should go by myself . But ... Do you have to ask that guy if you can blow your nose ? Come on , kid , cut the strings . It 's time to grow up . We 'll be back before he finishes his coffee . I guess it 'll be all right . Just me and the kid . I don 't want his guardian angel following us . Make sure he doesn 't . Come on . Let 's go . Jeffrey , come back here . Where are they going ? Into town . A little unfinished business . Yeah , Roosevelt 's been alive too long . JEFFREY : Hey , slow down , Billy . You 're going faster and faster . You 're just gonna have to keep up with me , kid . BOGG : How long do we have to sit here ? CHARLEY : Till Billy gets back . A man could go a little crazy hanging around like this . Got anything to liven things up a bit ? Like what ? Whisky ? I bought a new bottle back in town . Wouldn 't be a bad time to open it . It 's in my pack right there . Great . Come to think of it , I don 't even drink . Well , bon voyage . Why that dirty ... Get him . Get him ! Stop him ! Gotta stop here a minute . What for ? What are we gonna do , Billy ? I gotta see someone . ( COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ) Where 's Roosevelt ? Where 's Roosevelt ? I said , where 's Roosevelt ? He hasn 't been in today , Mr. Bonney . Honest . Anybody in here thinking of joining up with that posse he 's starting ? Nobody here . Nobody in the whole town . So that 's what we came to town for . To get Roosevelt . I 'm gonna do what I should 've done yesterday . You can 't ! First he hit me , then he called me a coward . I can 't let that pass . You see the way those people acted when I walked in ? That 's respect . I ain 't gonna lose that . That 's not respect , that 's fear . Yeah , well , that 's close enough . Is that what you really want ? People to be afraid of you ? Kid , that 's what keeps me alive . And every so often you gotta make an example so everybody remembers . If you shoot Roosevelt , it will be murder . Yeah , well , I 'll give him a fair chance . Fair ? You 're 10 times faster than he is and you know it . Kid , out here , that 's called survival . Survival of the fastest . You 're not a legend . You 're just a killer ! You going soft on me , kid ? I guess I am . You know , I used to pretend I was you . Even dress up like you . That was all made-up junk and it 's not fun anymore . That 's too bad . I brought you with me so you could see firsthand a small dose of Western justice . If you ain 't got the stomach for it , maybe you better run along , little boy . Sheriff , Sheriff . Sheriff , you gotta come quick . Billy the Kid is gonna gun down Teddy Roosevelt . Oh , I know . You know ? Well , aren 't you gonna do something ? No . Why not ? It 's Roosevelt 's problem . He got himself into this mess . But he 's gonna be killed . Well , he should 've known better . What kind of sheriff are you ? An old one . And I 've lived this long because I know when to step into something and when to stay out of it . But you have a job . You get paid to keep law and order in this town . When I was young , maybe . But not anymore . I 'm only a year away from retiring and I 'm not about to risk my neck . This town chooses to look the other way when it comes to Billy the Kid , and I choose to do the same . You 're a coward . Son , you have to understand . I 'm no match for Billy . He 'd shoot me down in the wink of an eye . Then two people would die . Me and Roosevelt . Billy 'd just step over my body and go after him anyway . But someone has to stand up to him . Well , someday , somebody will . Hey , Roosevelt . Hey , Roosevelt , I know you 're up there . Show your face . I hear you 've been looking for me . You heard right . Also heard you called me a coward . Right again . You just don 't know when somebody cut you some slack . I want no favors from you , Mr. Bonney . Then come down here and we 'll settle this once and for all . I 'll be right down . Billy , you can 't do this . You can 't . Oh , yeah ? Just watch me . Get away from me , kid . I ain 't got no use for you anymore . Where are you , Bogg ? I need you . Come on . Everybody off the streets . JEFFREY : Bogg ! Hold it . Stop ! What do you think you 're doing ? Putting a stop to this . What , are you crazy ? How do you expect to stop me without a gun ? I don 't need a gun . Yeah , you 're crazy , all right . Now get out of the street before you get shot ! You better heed Mr. Bonney . We will draw our guns and the best man will be left standing . If that 's true then I could tell you right now that Billy is the best man , because if you draw your gun , he 's gonna be the one left standing . And the way I see it , he 's no man at all . Bogg , look out ! JEFFREY : No , Billy , don 't do it . Please . You stay put . He was gonna shoot you in the back . Yeah , Billy is not one for playing fair . I think that was six . I hope that was six . ( CLICKING ) Mr. Roosevelt , Billy would 've killed you . I don 't back down , son . I know that . I also know your country needs you . I can 't tell you how I know , but I do . You 're going to mean a lot to this country 's history . Now , please , go back east where you belong . All right , son , I 'll leave . Maybe I can redeem myself by knowing when to walk away . I 'd like to thank you . And I hope to meet you both again someday . Goodbye . ( BILLY GRUNTING ) Don 't even try to move . You 're gonna die . You 're forgetting something . I got the gun . Come to think of it , I don 't need this . Give me a gun . Somebody give me a gun . I 'm Billy the Kid . Billy 's not much without his gun , is he ? Come back here . I mean it ! Not much with it , either . ( CRYING ) I 'm sorry , Bogg . I was stupid . I could 've ruined everything . I could 've got Roosevelt killed . All I care about is you 're okay . You learned a good lesson . So did I. What 's that ? That even though you act grown up , you 're still a kid . ( DINGS ) A pretty good kid . We 're on our way to Cuba . Where 'd they go ? ( SOLDIER SHOUTING ) Where are your men , Colonel ? You are captured , yet only this little rebel girl comes to your aid ? This little rebel girl will have your life if she ever gets free . I hope you exhibit such bravery when you stand in front of the firing squad . My men will come soon , you can be sure of that . They 'll give you a taste of your own medicine . ( WIND WHISTLING ) ( GRUNTS ) Excuse me . Bully ! I knew someone would come . I 've seen you two before . I don 't think so . Rita ? How do you know my name ? The rebels sent us . I knew my people would send someone for me . Good people , these Cubans . Take care of their own . Roosevelt ever captured ? I don 't think so . Yep . Red light . Mr. Roosevelt , where are your troops ? We were headed to San Juan Hill when I was cut off from them . That 's when I was captured . We have to get him back there , Bogg . The streets are filled with Spanish soldiers . We wouldn 't get 10 feet . I need a diversion . What are you gonna do , Bogg ? Stir things up outside . When you hear the first explosion , you and Rita get Roosevelt out of town . Bogg , be careful . It 's a matter of routine , kid . I 'll be at San Juan Hill with you before Teddy can yell " charge . " I think it 's time to wake this town up a little . Bombs away . ( PEOPLE CLAMORING ) It 's all clear . Let 's go . RITA : War is a strange thing . BOGG : Yeah . Tears people apart , brings others closer together . So true . Like us . No . Like my people . This war has united us like never before . With the help of Americans like you and Mr. Roosevelt , we will gain our independence . Oh , yeah , well , that , too . Thank you , Mr. Bogg . I will never forget what you have done . Now I must join the rebels . There is much more that needs to be done . Goodbye . Yeah , goodbye . I liked her in the other time zone better . Bogg ! Bogg , Mr. Roosevelt let me review the troops . And a bully job he did , too ! That 's great , kid . This could be a very decisive battle . We must take that hill . You will , Mr. Roosevelt . I know it . Thank you both . Nothing more to say then . Charge ! On to San Juan Hill . ( DINGS ) It 's green . I think we 're finally off the hook . How did things turn out with Rita ? Oh , fine . Fine . But , you know , she has this war and all that so ... Got dumped , huh ? Yeah . JEFFREY ...

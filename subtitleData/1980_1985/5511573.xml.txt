 Good evening . I 'm Howard K. Smith ... and this is the state of the war tonight . On the Philippine Island of Mindanao ... Resistance guerrillas under the leadership of Commander Beloy ... surprised and annihilated a regiment of alien shock troops ... moving to occupy the island . On the Brazilian front ... Resistance leaders suffered a great setback with the capture and execution ... of several high-ranking leaders in the Mato Grosso battalion . Here at home , our guerrillas claimed a major victory on the ground fighting ... in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains ... between Taos and Albuquerque , New Mexico . Casualties were said to be light in skirmishes along the Santa Fe trail ... as a number of alien outposts were overrun and destroyed . And this week , the Freedom Network awards it 's Medal of Valor ... to Marilyn McGeorge ... a housewife from Biloxi , Mississippi . She spotted the visitor patrol boat , Vargan , off the Gulf Coast ... rammed it with her husband 's fishing boat , sinking both vessels . Mrs. McGeorge was later found clinging to debris ... and was rescued . And that 's where we stand tonight . From the Freedom Network in New York ... our hopes are with you . Good night . Wait until you see this house . You 're gonna love it . I can 't wait . My mother 's gonna meet us there . Hey , come on , I want to buy you a present . Merry Christmas ! Thank you . Your generosity has been deeply appreciated . I have something here . I 've been saving this one all day for a pretty young girl like you . Ouch ! Oh , dear . Look what I 've done . - You okay ? - It 's just a scratch . I 'm so sorry . - Please take this one . It 's mistletoe . - Thank you . Okay . There you go . Merry Christmas . Yes . Merry Christmas . Attention , all patrol vehicles . Attention , all patrol vehicles . Be on the lookout for a red van heading toward the border . The drivers are suspected Resistance fighters ... smuggling orphan children into Los Angeles ... from the Occupied Zone . Now 's our chance . Let 's go . A few more yards and you 'll be safe ... you get to be kids again . You 're safe now . Are you kidding ? With you behind the wheel ? You 're sure the blood is from the Star-child Elizabeth ? Yes , I am . And that 's the holly you gave me to use . Yes . The dioxin veneer has kept the blood remarkably fresh . You 've been most helpful . I knew one of them would find her . Now you can mold a Star-child to your own genetic design . Although I can 't say I understand what all this is about . Half the world is poison to us because of the Red Dust . Yet , Elizabeth , who 's half human , half like us , seems to be immune . If we can replicate her , perhaps we can produce an antitoxin ... and finally put an end to this war . Excuse me . I 've done my part . Where 's my husband ? Why , where he 's always been . Here , in detention . You promised we would be together again for Christmas dinner . And you will . Our Christmas dinner . Take her away . You lied ! You said you 'd let him come home ! You lied ! Humans take holidays so seriously . What do you mean , another van of children got through the border ? Why is it that we continue to let a band of vigilantes ... make a mockery of the laws of this city ? We made a positive ID on Donovan and Tyler . Donovan and Tyler . What a surprise . - Mr. Bates , I ... - Mr. Chiang ... this is not the way I like to start my day . You 've failed . Every time you go up against them , we come out second best . - Mr. Bates ... - No more excuses . I want you to find whatever rock these so-called heroes are hiding under ... and crush them ! - Okay , this is the church . - Visitor 's don 't respect sanctuary . It 's as good a halfway house as any other . Slip to the side . It 's almost too quiet this close to Christmas . With Diana picking their kids off the street ... people don 't have much to celebrate . Let 's check it out . Freeze ! You 're slipping . If I were a lizard you 'd be dead . Think again , big fella . - Ham ! - Darned right , brother ! What brings you in from the desert ? The desert unit 's history . Was shot all to hell . Father Turney found me . Saved my life . For the last month , I 've been running an underground railroad into this place . - You know each other . - You could say that . Old friends . We intercepted the van this morning . All the kids are safe . We found foster homes for them in the Open City . Bless you , Michael . If it weren 't for you smuggling children into the Open City ... there 'd be more tears than smiles this Christmas . We do what we can . When are the rest of the kids gonna get here ? In the morning . Michael , it 's getting too dangerous around the church . The Visitors are coming around more often . They suspect something . I 'm afraid I 'm not gonna be in business much longer . - How come you look so grumpy ? - I don 't like little girls . - Tough guy , huh ? - Tough enough . Maybe . What 's your name ? They call me Ham . Ham ? That 's a funny name . Sounds like a sandwich . We 've got company . Jennifer , out the back , quick ! - I want that one . - You got him . You 'd better leave with us , Father . Thank you , Michael . But this is where I 'm needed . Don 't worry . There are people who will help me . Now leave these three gentlemen to me ... and go with God . We 'll pick up Jennifer and the other kids tomorrow . He 's got a lot more faith in his fellow man than I do . You got that right . - So , what do you think ? - I love it . Think we can live here ? You know , sometimes I pretend there 's no war ... - and you and I are just ... - Just what ? It 's just a dream . Come on . What kind of dream ? When I was little ... my mother used to say if you had a special dream ... you shouldn 't tell anyone or else it wouldn 't come true . Maybe I can make it come true . Isn 't this a pretty picture . - Mother . - Don 't say anything ! You 're my daughter . I trusted you . - Look , Robin , I tried to ... - And you ! How could you ? Mother , please . It not his fault . We just ... You just snuck around behind my back . No , wrong . We just fell in love . It wasn 't anything we planned . We didn 't do it to spite you . It just happened . - Yeah , I 'll bet ! - Mother , please . No . Let her go . She needs ... Just let her go . That 's terrible . Take a walk . Willie , are you all right ? Yes . He only injured my prize . What is that noise ? That is our national anthem . You never should have interfered with its DNA structure . - It 's growing out of control . - That 's your opinion . You 're dealing in unknowns . Genetic engineering is a dangerous game . - I 'm going to have to ... - I don 't play games , Dennis . I 'm a scientist . And this little experiment is under control . My control . Anyone who fails to understand that can be replaced ... immediately . Now , what was it you were going to do ? Help you ... any way I can . I knew you 'd understand . I know she hates me . Of course she doesn 't hate you , Elizabeth . She 's just upset . What should I do ? Just talk to her . Just tell her how you feel . - She won 't listen . - Of course she will . She 's your mother . What is this ? A lady was selling corsages . I pricked it on a thorn . That 's really strange . The blood doesn 't seem to be coagulating . Come here for a second . Just wanna get a culture of this . It won 't hurt a bit . - It 's fine , really . - Yeah , I know . Here . There . See . I 'll run some tests on this when I get back to the lab . No way , Santa . - Not even if I used pillows , boss ? - Not even if you use a whole mattress . Sorry , Willie . You mean , I don 't get to dress up and give out the pheasants ? Maybe next year . - What was that ? - It came from the lab . - The clone . - It 's escaped . - Who 's our best tracker ? - Laird . Get him . I want it brought back . Damn it ! If those kids are hurt ... Move ! He 's dead . Hey ! What are you doing out here alone ? You 're hurting me . Father Turney said you 'd be coming back for us . Where is he , sweetheart ? This way . Jennifer , you found them . Good for you . I 'm glad you 're here . I see the Visitors came looking for the three we mopped up . They were under the misguided notion that by destroying the building ... they could eradicate the beliefs that built it . Look , it 's nice to know someone still has faith . No point in giving the lizards another chance . He 's right . Children , I think it 's time to go . God helps those who help themselves . - Did I say something wrong ? - What ? Are you mad at me ? When they took my mommy and daddy away from me ... I didn 't want to talk to anybody either . Come on , Jennifer . Time to go . Mother ... I knew you 'd be here . You used to bring me here when I was little , remember ? Why didn 't you tell me ? I wanted to ... but I was afraid you wouldn 't understand . I 'm your mother . I confided in you . Why couldn 't you confide in me ? I don 't know ! Please don 't be mad at me . Do you really love him ? I think so . It 's so strange . I 'm so excited when he 's around me . I 've never felt that way before . - And Kyle feels the same way ? - Yes . But I 'd never see him again ... if you thought that would make him love you instead . I know he doesn 't love me . I guess I 've known that for a long time . I 'd never do anything to hurt you . I know . But it doesn 't make the pain go away . Come on , I 'll take you back . We 'll finish this later . Does this mean you 're not gonna be moving out ? I don 't know . I 'd kind of like a little time to myself . I 've already talked to Julie . - What is it ? - I 'm not sure . Probably nothing . Elizabeth ? I don 't know . Feels like someone ... - Is this your car ? - Yes , it is . You frightened us . Park 's off-limits after 4 p.m. Bates ' orders . - I 'm sorry . We didn 't know . - You do now . Now move on before I have to run you in . Thank you for being so concerned . Just doing my job , ladies . Hey , you ! Hold on . Hey , don 't be afraid . What 's wrong ? Got a cold ? Or has the cat got your tongue ? He died of puncture wounds to the head . It has to be the clone . She 's had her first taste of human . Yes . A policeman . Do you know what that means ? Yes . She 's growing , getting stronger ... and more like us than one of them . It means that every policeman in Los Angeles will be out looking for her . - And when they find her ... - They won 't find her . You will . And you will follow her and bring her back at all costs . And if someone gets in my way ? If you have to ask , then you 're the wrong man for the job . Dioxin in Elizabeth 's blood ! What the hell are you doing ? Stop that ! Get away from there ! What 's wrong with you ? You crazy or something ? Okay . All right . Just ... Okay . I took a sample of Elizabeth 's blood . - I found traces of dioxin in it . - What is that ? It 's a very powerful poison . But in this case ... maybe it was used for preserving blood for keeping it fresh . - What could that mean ? - I don 't know . But one thing I do know for sure is no flower peddler would be using it . We interrupt this program to bring you a special report . Police in Los Angeles this afternoon have issued an all-points bulletin ... and are warning all citizens to be on the lookout for this woman . Wanted in connection with vandalism and assault charges ... she is also a prime suspect ... in the brutal slaying of a police officer earlier today in Sherman Oaks . She is considered extremely dangerous . We now return you to our original programming . It can 't be . Elizabeth was with me all day . It must be a mistake . That 's not Elizabeth . I don 't know how Diana did it , but she must 've created Elizabeth 's double . - Where is Elizabeth ? - I don 't know . She said she had some last-minute shopping to do . You 've got to find her . I 'm going to go to the lab and see what I can find out from Bates , okay ? They were all at the Club Creole , sir . At least a half a dozen are known Resistance members . Donovan . Tyler . We haven 't seen this one for quite a while . It is no coincidence , sir . You may be right . Did you actually see her with Donovan or Tyler ? Yes , sir . Did she seem ... friendly ? I couldn 't tell . She is one of them . I think it 's time we let her prove it . Why are you so angry with me ? Get lost . What 's the problem with him ? See , it happened while we were in Nam . Just before the fall of Saigon . He 'd married a local Eurasian girl and they 'd had a daughter . Cute little thing . Had ? Ham and me got ordered to Nicaragua . The brass promised they 'd airlift his wife and child out . So he packed them up and left them at a church on the edge of Saigon . What happened ? An air strike was called in to halt the Cong advance . One flyboy jumped the gun and dropped his napalm early . It hit the church . By the time we got back , all he found was a burnt-out building . After Saigon fell , Ham kept slipping back in , searching . He never found them . Lost her ? That 's unacceptable . A temporary setback , I assure you . For your sake , I should hope so . I 've carried the leader 's standard to victory before . He personally decorated me for bravery . Then tracking a child shouldn 't be too difficult . Complicated by Bates ' police alert : Yes . Difficult : No . Then find her , without any temporary setbacks . Don 't abuse me , Diana . There are other commanders who can use my talents . Perhaps you miss my point . If she is not found by dark ... I 'll end more than your military career . I know this is tough on you , Tyler . I 'm missing a son . We 've all lost someone . I appreciate the sentiment , Gooder , but I 'll handle it , okay ? I 'm trying to say you 've gotta hang on to your hope . If I wanted a preacher , I 'd talk to Father Turney . When have you seen the phone company ... and the water and power boys working the street at the same time ? And window washers across the street . Place is pretty busy out there . Let 's go . Hi , Nathan , I 've got a question for you . I was just wondering ... Julie , I 'm so glad to see you . I was afraid you 'd be at the Club Creole . What ? No matter what your friendships and confused loyalties , I still value you . I care for you far too much to want to find your body ... among the others in the wreckage . - What are you talking about ? - As of this afternoon , the Club Creole ... will be no more . I really appreciate your concern for me . You 've always been a part of Science Frontiers . I hope you always will be . Now , what was it you wanted ? It 's not important . I 'll be in my lab . - Well ? - The relay is connected , sir . Relax , Mr. Chiang . We won 't have long to wait . - Club Creole . - Who is this ? Elias ? Julie , I 'm so disappointed in you . Besides , you 're too late . Down that way ! You go to the left . I 'll take the right . Your men aren 't having much luck . I apologize , sir for their incompetence , as well as my own . Unfortunately , Dr. Parrish has slipped through our fingers . It looks that way , doesn 't it ? Doesn 't matter . I think we both know where she 'll show up ... what she 'll find when she gets there . She won 't find anything ... or anyone . - There 's gotta be ... - I 'm with you . I 'm sure your mother will like it . Since the war , we don 't get much imported material . Thank you . Hey , how are you ? Merry Christmas . I 'll take this one . Well , I don 't know . It 's my last one . Who 's it for ? Someone special . He must be to have you . Okay . Elizabeth ? Are you by yourself ? Hold on , I 'll be out in a minute . Seasons greetings , gentlemen . What can I get you ? A little bit of eggnog ? A little Christmas punch ? Nothing like a little Christmas punch ... to get the holiday cheer going , huh ? No , sir . Everything is under control . I suspect it will only be a matter of minutes . I take that back , Mr. Bates . What you just heard ... is the last gasp of the Resistance . All that 's left to do now , sir ... is sift through the rubble . - Nicely done , Mr. Chiang . - Thank you , Mr. Bates . Everybody 's okay . Let 's get out of here . It 's all right . I thought I sensed you in the park today . I won 't hurt you . Here you go . Elizabeth ? Don 't hurt her ! Elizabeth , get away . She won 't hurt me . - You don 't know that ! - I do ! I can tell . He won 't hurt you . Elizabeth , don 't . She saved my life . It 's over . It 's okay now , Elizabeth . Both destroyed ? But how ? Genetic engineering is an inexact science at best ... even for you , Diana . That 's because I 'm surrounded by incompetents . I take offense at that . Such aggressive behavior , Dennis . I think I have just the place for you . - Here you are . - That 's good . Here you go . Hi . You sure you 're okay ? You 're awfully quiet . I just keep trying to understand why she did it . She saved my life . I don 't know . I guess that we 'll never know . Maybe she was trying to get back to you any way that she could . Get back to me ? You were the source of her life , Elizabeth . Her beginning . Perhaps Diana underestimated the power of that . Zon teaches ... that all creatures seek to reunite with their source ... to come together in peace and good will . Like Christmas . How did you guys manage to keep this place intact ? Chris wired the explosives to knock in just the walls and ceiling upstairs . There 's nothing left of the kitchen . So there 's no way they can find the door . You mean the only way we can get in here is through the alley ... or the sewers ? I kind of like it like that . Where 's Ham ? Well , sweetheart ... I don 't think he 's much in the Christmas spirit today . Ho ! Ho ! Merry Christmas ! It 's Ham ! Merry Christmas ! Santa Claus ! To victory . To friends and family . To peace . To Christmas . Merry Christmas , everyone ! Merry Christmas . English

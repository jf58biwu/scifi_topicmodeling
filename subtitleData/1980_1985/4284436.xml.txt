 ( ANNOUNCER CHATTERING ) That 's Joe Louis , heavyweight champ . ( MEN CHATTERING ) Schmeling beat you two years ago and now he wants to beat you again . JOE ... If I go down again to that man , everybody loses . Don 't get cute or we 'll all land very early a piece at a time . ( WOMAN EXCLAIMING ) Hello ? I need help . Hello , can you hear me ? MAN ... ( ON RADIO ) We 'll have to bring you in . I can 't land this plane . BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! ( PLUMMETING ) BOGG : We better swim for it , kid . JEFFREY : Bogg , put your feet down , you can walk right out . I knew that . I was just testing you . I don 't care what you say . The Omni needs a 60 zillion mile checkup . Quit complaining . We almost missed the lake , didn 't we ? Almost ? Funny , I don 't feel almost wet , I feel soaked . ( BEEPING ) Where are we anyway ? Pompton Lakes , New Jersey . June , 1938 . I 've never heard of Pompton Lakes . Red light 's blinking . Yeah , well , unless the ducks are in trouble ... Well , something 's wrong . We 'll find it . Come on . ( MEN CHATTERING ) Get out of the corner , Joe . MAN 1 : Come on , Joe . MAN 2 : Come on , Joe . Get off the ropes . Off the ropes . Come on , Joe . ( BELL DINGING ) MAN 3 : Come on , come on , come on . What is that ? What am I seeing here ? What am I seeing ? My mama could give Billy a better workout than that . I 'll pick it up this round . Three days , Joe , and we break camp . You know , this has turned out to be even bigger than just a title fight . Schmeling beat you two years ago and now he wants to beat you again . Only this time he 's out to prove something . Colored people got it tough enough without all this Aryan supremacy the Nazis are talking about . Am I supposed to give him a fight or run for office ? Give me the bell . ( BELL DINGING ) ( MEN CHATTERING ) Bogg , look . I see . Brown Bomber . You know who that is ? Are you kidding ? That 's Joe Louis , heavyweight champ . Maybe the best there ever was . Hey , I thought you said you were at the bottom of your class . And light heavyweight champ of my boxing team . This is my kind of history , kid . You never told me . Even I can be modest . Guess I never noticed . Next time . I think we found the place , let 's find the problem . Come on . Come on . Come on . JEFFREY : Why isn 't he fighting back ? BOGG : I think he 's trying . Well , he 's not trying very hard . The other guy is all over him . You noticed that too , huh ? Come on , Joe , come on . Get your hands up . Come on , Joe . Come on , Joe . MAN 1 : Oh , come on . Come on ! MAN 2 : Joe , what 's the matter with you ? Let 's go . Joe , what do you think you 're doing ? MAN 3 : Joe , you just can 't walk away . MAN 4 : Where you going , champ ? You 're not finished yet . Joe , you all right ? Stay here . Joe , now , look , don 't do this . Brown Bomber ? It 's more like the Brown Bummer . I have more than a hunch that 's why we 're here . Hey ! This is a closed camp . You guys get out of here . Yeah , we were just lost . Maybe you could ... You mean you better get lost . I mean , like yesterday . No kidding , fellows . We 're just lost . Out . What do you think ? I think maybe another time we 'll get acquainted , huh ? JACK : If you can 't handle Billy , what do you think Max Schmeling is going to do to you ? JOE : I know what Schmeling can do . So you lost to Schmeling , so what ? He beat me good . Joe , no one goes undefeated . Not Dempsey . Not Tunney . Not Baer . And not you . What 's the matter with you ? Nothing . No , no , no , come on , buddy , lay it out for me . Now , this is more than just a case of you losing your nerve . I know you too well for that . What is it ? Leave it alone , Jack . No , sir . You know , ever since you gave that interview two weeks ago , you 've been acting funny . Neglecting your training , letting yourself go soft . And that 's it , isn 't it ? That interview ! I said leave it ! No , sir , I 'm going to push it , Joe ! And don 't you walk out of here until you 've satisfied me , brother ! You really want to know , man ? You want the truth ? I 'll give you the truth . That man , that reporter , he was sharp . He knew , he let me know . If I lose that fight , everybody in the whole country 's gonna believe the black man isn 't good enough . My whole people , your people , Jack . How 'd you like that load laid on you , man ? But if I duck it , they can call me chicken not you , not Billy , not Seth . Just me , get it ? Just Joe Louis . He 's supposed to beat Schmeling , isn 't he ? Yeah . And the whole world is waiting for this rematch . What are we gonna do ? I got a great idea . Come on . That 's a great idea ? Bogg , who in their right mind would want to be a punching bag for Joe Louis ? Bogg . I was real good . I know how to protect myself . Against Joe Louis ? Listen , he 's gotta face somebody tough . Or at least somebody he thinks is tough . That 's why we 're here . Well , you saw him . The mood he 's in right now , he 's gonna lose that fight . You got a better idea ? I don 't mean any disrespect , Bogg . I mean , I 'm sure you were good and everything . But how are you gonna make them let you get in the ring with him ? I 'm going to let you talk them into it . Come on . Say , anybody seen Joe ? Some road work , I think . We should be so lucky . Seth , what 's going on ? Now don 't you guys come down on me . I can tell him how to train and when to train , but I can 't make him train . Hi . What ? Who are you ? I 'm Jeff , Jeffrey Jones from New York City . Well , what do you want , Jeffrey Jones from New York City ? And how in the blazes did you get in here ? I wanted to see the champ spar . Well , we 're through for the day . Besides , this is a closed camp . Yeah . I saw the session or whatever you call it . Yeah , well , that didn 't mean anything . Champ 's just having an off day , that 's all . Good . Then I guess you won 't need Bogg . Bogg , who 's Bogg ? Bogg , come here . Kommen Sie . ( IN GERMAN ACCENT ) Herr Bogg , at your service . Bogg 's one of Max Schmeling 's sparring partners . Or at least he was , until they fired him . Yeah ? How come ? They wanted Schmeling working with guys who could fight like Louis . Bogg here , all he knows how to do is fight like Schmeling . And what are you , his manager ? No , Bogg 's my uncle from the old country . Yeah , so ? Don 't you see ? Bogg would be a great sparring partner for Louis . Really get him ready for the fight . Schmeling no good . Bogg show Louis how to beat Schmeling . See , Bogg 's got a really big grudge . He 'll make Joe look good . Promise . What are you trying to say , kid ? I just thought it would be a good confidence builder for Joe , if he beat a German guy , a white German guy . And my uncle , he 's not real good . Oh , yeah ? Hey , Fred , Seth . Those two again . Sorry , Jack . I 'll get rid of them . No , forget it . I want you to go and find Joe . Right away . I don 't know , Bogg , he looks awfully solid . Well , what am I , chopped liver ? I just don 't want you to get hurt . We 're just sparring , kid . I know how to move , duck . If I go down , don 't worry . I just want him to know he could get to me . Hey , what 's the big idea ? I just want you to try this guy . He knows Schmeling 's style , sparred with him . Hey , I don 't need to do this . Oh , yes , you do . We both know that . This guy 's a bum . Now go on out there and do some work , huh ? JACK : Ready ? Give me the bell . ( BELL DINGING ) Got get him . MAN 1 : All right , let 's go . Let 's go . All right . ( ALL EXCLAIMING ) Look at this . MAN 2 : All right , that 's it . ( ALL CHATTERING ) Yeah , yeah , all right , come on . All right , all right , move in . MAN 3 : Come on , Joe . MAN 1 : Come on , now . Come on , keep your guard up . Oh , yeah . Your guard , come on . Yeah , yeah . Watch yourself . Don 't let him hurt you . MAN 1 : Easy , easy . All right . MAN 2 : That 's it . You got him going now . JEFFREY : Give him the old one , two . The old ein , zwei . MAN 3 : Come on , Joe , defense . MAN 1 : There you go , jab him , jab him . ( ALL EXCLAIMING ) Joe , you hurt ? Joe , are you all right , Joe ? Come on , let 's get him to the corner . Oh , no , I 've really done it . Get the stool . Get the stool . Where 's the stool ? That 's making him look good ? You 'll never see a luckier punch . I couldn 't do that again if my life depended on it . Stay tuned . It may . I guess you made your point , Jack . Oh , Joe , you looked great . The best in a long time . That punch was just a fluke . Who 're you kidding ? Schmeling 's gonna even be worse . Tell the promoters I 've been hurt . Tell them anything . I 'm not going to fight . Now , that 's crazy . This is the fight of the century , Joe . You heard me . It 's off ! And they will suspend you . Maybe even take away the title ! I don 't care what they do . The so-called fight of the century is not going to happen . Well , all right . So it didn 't exactly work out how I planned it . We 'll just have to think of something else . Bogg . It 's gonna be a little harder than I thought . Bogg ! What ? Hey , guys , we were just leaving . Don 't be in such a hurry . Right . We were pretty impressed . Come on , it was a punch in a million . I bet I could learn a lot from you , Herr Bogg . Why don 't we go a few rounds ? No way he could ever do that again . No . It was most unfortunate what happened . Unfortunate ? Nobody , but nobody sucker punches our man . In the ring , tough guy . Bogg , I don 't think he really just wants to spar with you . Well , at least he 's willing to put the gloves on . Look ... I 'm not interested in a knuckle sandwich . I 've got the Omni . Let 's just get out of here . Hang on to it . I don 't look for fights , but I don 't run from them either . Hey , where 's the mouth piece ? Anyone that can knock down Joe Louis doesn 't need one . Come on , man , get the other glove on . He 's gonna cream you . Just lace it up . I 'm sorry , pal . MAN ON RADIO ... Roger . US Columbia 14 cleared for flight level two eight thousand . Maintain heading and air speed . Over . Thank you , Tango control . This is US Columbia 14 . Out . Come on , Brooks , earn some money . All right . I got it . It 's your airplane . It 's big ditch time . Right . Ladies and gentlemen , this is your copilot again . In just a few moments you 'll be able to see the Grand Canyon out the port , make that the left side of the airplane . There 'll be no extra charge for this , except in coach . Are you sure I can 't get you a soft drink , Mr. Stewart ? ( PLUMMETING ) What ? No , no , no . Well , how about some coffee ? Hey , look . Right in the air . We never did this before . Why 'd you go and Omni us out for ? It was psyching him out . Look , I don 't like the sight of blood , okay ? Especially yours . ( BEEPING ) February , 1970 . Somewhere over Nevada . Red light . I guess somebody important is on this plane . I don 't know . Hurry up and get these off . May I help you , sir ? No , thanks . Guess you 're wondering why I got these on , huh ? Well , I sell them . And the kid here wanted to see how it 's done in the big league . Where are you sitting , sir ? Sitting ? What do you mean ? In the back . Right . Way back . May I see your tickets , please ? You got the tickets ? I thought you had the tickets . Thought he had the tickets . Wait here , please . I think we 're in trouble . At least they can 't throw us off . ( PHONE BUZZING ) Yeah . PATTY ... Mike , we 've got a couple of stowaways here . I think you better come on out . Got a couple of freebies . Freebies ? Yeah . US Colombia Airways . The stowaway 's favorite . Try and sell them first class . Good afternoon , folks . I 'm Copilot Dorfman . Am I correct in assuming that you do not have tickets for this flight ? Well , yeah . As a matter of airline policy , I can give you the opportunity to purchase tickets at this time , or ... Excuse me . Would you kindly wait until I 'm through ? This won 't wait , flyboy . You want to guess what 's in the case ? Mike ? Stay right where you are , lady . Do you hear me ? All of you just stay right where you are . Nobody is gonna get hurt if you pay attention and do exactly what I say . Let 's not alarm the whole plane . Anyway you want it . Just don 't get cute or we 'll all land very early a piece at a time . Now , the pilot here and I are going on the radio and open up the bidding . What ? Could I please go to my seat ? You see , my wife 's down there and I told her I 'd be right back . Don 't move . Don 't anyone get too near me either if my thumb slips . STEWART : And I want any executive jet with a 2,000 mile range . Two parachutes , no games . And finally , the suitcase . MAN ... A million dollars is an awful lot . We need more time . The banks are open , friend . Now , hold on . The pilot wants to talk to you . This is Brooks . We 've made a course correction for Salt Lake City , maintaining flight level two eight thousand . The automatic pilot is engaged . We are being removed from the cockpit . Clear the air corridor all the way in . Roger . We have radar contact . All traffic being advised . When will you call Salt Lake ? Over . Don 't call us . We 'll call you . PATTY : Under these difficult conditions . But you must remain calm . We are doing everything possible to ensure a prompt and safe landing . Because of the nature of the threat , the captain has asked that you remain in your seats at all times . We will keep you advised when we have any further information . We 're over the Rockies , headed for Salt Lake . Thank you for your cooperation . Captain , now , I suggest you keep the lid on out here . I know the rap on air piracy so I 'm not taking any chances . Now I 'm going back into the flight deck , just so nobody gets any funny ideas . Just in case , maybe I ought to bring you along just to keep me company . Bogg . Wait , no . Oh , yeah . Get in there , kid . Hold on a second . Take me in there with you . I won 't be any trouble . That 's a promise . Oh , I know that . Come on , kid , move . Leave him alone . I 'll go with you . Come on . Don 't even think about it , kid . I wasn 't . I 'll bet . ( SIGHS ) All right . In case you 're still wondering , let me just put all the doubts right out of your head . That doesn 't look like dynamite to me . That 's right . It 's not . But there 's enough shaped plastique in that case to blow the plane right in half . What are you doing now ? What , are you taking a professional interest ? Just curious . Before this case gets to be too popular , we 'll just add a little surprise in case I misplace it . What 's in those canisters ? Don 't get in an uproar . It 's not deadly . It 's just a knockout gas . What are you gonna do if you let it go , hold your breath ? No , wise guy . You know , the flight crew , they 've got their own oxygen . Now , if I had to I could get in here with one flyboy . That 's all I 'd need . What about the ... Oh , the magic masks . I already unplugged them so they 're not working . MAN ... ( ON RADIO ) US Columbia 14 , Salt Lake Center . US Columbia 14 , this is Salt Lake . Do you read ? Over . This is Stewart . You can cut the old Roger Wilco business . Do you have the money and the plane and everything I asked for ? Everything is as you requested . Are the crew and passengers all right ? Well , if you just keep doing your job , buster , you 'll be able to see for yourself . US Columbia 14 , you are 200 miles out and need course correction for approach . Over . All right , that means that you want a pilot , right ? Affirmative , US Columbia . We have new coordinates for ... All right , just hang on . All right , move . Hey , you okay ? Yeah . He 's got the briefcase ... Just shut up , kid ! All right , now , we 're getting close . Captain , you 're gonna land this bird alone . That 's not possible ... Forget it , forget the rules . We both know you can handle it . It 'll be okay . All right , now , once we reach the ground everyone just remain in your seat . No exceptions . Captain , let 's go . No matter what he does keep all the passengers calm . Bogg ! No , no ! The case is booby trapped . ( ALL COUGHING ) Don 't breathe ! Bogg ! Can anyone hear me ? MAN 1 ... US Columbia 14 . Salt Lake Center . Please answer . Do you read ? You 're getting pretty close now . US Columbia 14 , come in , please . US Columbia 14 . Salt Lake Center . Please answer . Do you read ? Do you read ? US Columbia 14 , come in . This is Salt Lake Center calling US Columbia 14 , please answer . ( GASPING ) Hello ? Hello ? Somebody ? I need help . Hello , can you hear me ? US Columbia 14 , this is Salt Lake Center . We hear you . Who is this speaking ? I 'm all alone . Nobody 's awake . I don 't know what to do . Slow down . Who is this speaking ? Jeffrey , Jeffrey Jones . Jones , did you ever fly an airplane ? Fly a plane ? Mister , I 'm just a kid . Now easy , son . All traffic around you has been cleared , so you 're not going to hit anybody . Now , just relax and tell me what 's going on up there . How long since the gas was released ? Not more than 10 minutes ago . Okay , you 're doing fine , Jeffrey . You 're gonna make a great reporter someday . Someday is right . Now listen , you 've got a lot to do . We don 't know anything about that gas or how long until somebody wakes up . What we do know is that your plane has to come down now . We 'll have to bring you in . What ? Me ? I can 't land this plane . Well , now , that little airplane you 're in can almost land itself . You might need to give it just a little help , that 's all . MAN 2 ... Hey , Jonesy ! You still awake up there ? JEFFREY ... Yeah , who 's this ? Why , this here is the best dang pilot that money can buy . You and me are gonna have a whale of a time while you solo this baby . JEFFREY ... Solo ? You 're gonna bring it right on home . How are you in a go-cart ? No sweat . Neither is this . Your captain set you just right for Salt Lake and you are right on course . Okay . MAN 2 ... It 's about time for you to do your first trick . Are you ready ? I guess . Sure you are . Now , Jeffrey , straight in front of you , just about level with your chin , slightly on the right , there 's a dial that reads 116.8 I think I see it . Okay , now , when I tell you , I want you to turn that knob so it reads 110 . 7 . 110.7 . That 's right . Now , take hold of it . I 've got it . Ready , set , turn it . 110.7 . Good , good boy . Now , right up over that dial , over the windshield , it 's marked landing , there are four switches . Do you see them ? JEFFREY : Yeah . You take hold of those and ease them all up at the same time . Now ? You bet . All right . Well , now , aren 't you something ? Do you know what you just did ? Uh-uh . You just got yourself all ready to land that baby . You activated the automatic landing system . JEFFREY : I did ? I can see you on the radar screen . You 're doing great . Now , son , down by your right knee there 's a dial that shows your air speed . Does it have a knob on it ? That 's the baby . Take hold and turn it to 140 . Okay . MAN ON PA ... All emergency vehicles to runway 26 left . Emergency landing in progress . All emergency vehicles to runway 26 left . Emergency landing in progress . ( SIRENS WAILING ) MAN 2 ... Okay , partner , this is where the home cooking is . Come on in . MAN ON PA ... All emergency vehicles to runway 26 left . Emergency landing in progress . All emergency vehicles to runway 26 left . Hey , we 're almost there . Don 't start getting fidgety on me . JEFFREY ... I 'm trying not to . I 'll bet you got that seat all the way up like I told you . Yes , sir . MAN 2 ... You can reach the brakes now , can 't you ? You mean I have to stop the plane ? Piece of cake , Jeffrey . Piece of cake . Now , on the floor , by your feet , two pedals , just like in a car ? Yeah . Well , you get those old toes ready , 'cause just as soon as that bird kisses the ground you 're gonna push on those at the same time . Okay . Ready now ? Yeah . MAN 2 ... Now , push ! ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ( SIREN WAILING ) Harder , Jeffrey . Harder ! I 'm trying ! I 'm trying ! Stand on them , boy ! Well ? MAN 2 ... Well , what ? We 're down . I did it . I can 't believe it . Oh , you barnstormers are all alike . Always trying to make the easy things look tough . Welcome home , partner . Jeffrey , when you want to be a pilot , come see me . Thanks a lot . You bet . Thank you , partner . All right . See you around , Cap . Bogg , you should have seen it . It was incredible . Sorry . I don 't usually sleep on the job . I 'm real proud of you . Thanks . Hey , I wonder how we really changed history on this flight . Are you kidding ? All those lives . You don 't have to be big and important , you know . Every life 's a part of history . ( OMNI DINGS ) Who knows ? Somebody famous might have been aboard . Bogg . What ? Never mind . You wouldn 't believe me anyway . ( PLUMMETING ) Well , at least we missed the lake this time . The Omni never makes the same mistake twice . ( MAN CHATTERING ON SCREEN ) Louis goes to his knees , hangs on the ropes . Can it be over ? He 's defenseless . Now , close to the end , Louis can 't get up . Joe Louis has been knocked down . He has lost ... Joe Louis has suffered ... Mr. Louis . Okay , you 've seen the show so beat it . That was Schmeling , huh ? Yeah . The one still standing . Joe , listen , I 'm not really a fighter , at least not in your league . Hey , what happened to your accent ? Well , I 'm not really German either . Who sent you here ? Nobody exactly . But we 're here to help . I don 't need any help . Especially yours . But you 've got to beat Schmeling . I 'm not even fighting Schmeling . Or anybody else . I 'm retired . I 'm going home tomorrow . So get out . I want to pack . What are you waiting on ? You want me to call the boys ? Come on , give us a break , Joe . We know what you 're thinking . I 'm not thinking of nothing . Look , everybody gets scared . Just think how scared Schmeling must be knowing that you 're better than he is . Schmeling isn 't scared of me . The master race isn 't scared of anybody . That 's garbage and you know it . Do I ? Don 't you think I know what people are saying ? What the Nazis are doing ? Mister , we 're not talking about just another fight . That 's why you can 't back down . You 've got to show them . A black man can 't lose . Not in these times . You 're wrong , Joe . A black man can win or lose . You think your people are gonna feel any better because you won 't face him ? I can take that rap . Well , what 's the difference between getting beat and looking like you 're afraid to get beat ? What 's the difference ? Man , there 's a big difference . If I go down again to that man , everybody loses . Not just black people but everybody who doesn 't have blond hair or blue eyes . I bet Jesse Owens didn 't think like that . Two years ago at the Olympics , he stuck it right in Hitler 's eye . Now , you 've got the chance to stick it in his other eye . That 's if I win . Well , if you don 't try , we 'll never know , will we ? Aren 't you boys listening to me ? There 's just too much to lose here . Even if you do lose , you 'll still be proving something . Yeah , that they 're right . No . That the son of a sharecropper from Alabama tried to be the best in the world at what he does . Joe ? I got to think . I gotta go for a walk . I got to think . You seen him ? No , I haven 't seen him . Bogg , wake up ! Where 's Joe ? I fell asleep . Me , too . How long can his walk take ? I don 't know . We gave him a lot to think about . Come on . Uh-oh . Just the guys we want to see . That 's far enough . Look , we don 't want any trouble , all right ? Oh , it 's not gonna be any trouble . Not for me anyway . Hey , isn 't Joe with you guys ? What 's going on here ? I thought you were German . JOE : He 's not German . I don 't know what he is , but he and the kid ... Well , they help remind me of a couple of things . And you know everybody doesn 't dream about being a boxer but they all dream about being something . And I don 't want them to ever back off like I was thinking about doing . You mean you 're gonna fight Schmeling ? ( ALL CHEERING ) Say , look at you , you haven 't been working hard . ( BEEPING ) It 's still red . What ? It can 't be . You know , that fight 's coming up pretty quick ? You 're flabby , champ . I know I 'm out of shape , but I gotta try . Try , heck . You 're soft , man . There 's still time , Joe . Haven 't any of you guys heard of Rocky Balboa ? BOGG : Who 's Rocky Balboa ? MAN 1 : Never heard of him . MAN 2 : The explorer ? MAN 3 : Rocky who ? It doesn 't matter . I know just what to do . Come on . Kid , if Joe eats that side of beef you 'll be able to beat him . What is this ? ( BELL DINGING ) JACK : Go ahead , pop him , pop him . Jab ! Get him ! Come on , Joe , you can pull him . JEFFREY : All right , get him , champ . Don 't let him hurt you . Get that body . Back , Joe . JEFFREY : Yeah , all right , champ . BOGG : Come on , Joe , you pull him . Yeah , all right . Keep your guard up , Joe . Keep the guard up , come on . All right , you 're looking good . You can do it ! Come on , Joe ! Get him , yeah . Come on , Joe , look at that man move . You 're looking great , champ . Come on , champ ! ( ALL CHEERING ) JEFFREY : Now that 's the Brown Bomber . Champ , champ , you 're ready , man . You are ready . ( CROWD CHEERING ) ANNOUNCER ... Now , Louis moves in one more time on Schmeling , and he staggers him with a right upper cut to the head . Snaps his head back . Topples him now . And Schmeling is holding onto the ropes . We 're only in the first round , but it is Louis who is taking control of this fight . The rematch has Louis pounding Schmeling . Schmeling staggering away now . Louis moves in with the left hand ... He 's all over him . Right . But how can he keep that up for 15 rounds ? Just watch . ( SPEAKING GERMAN ) I wonder what those guys just said . ANNOUNCER ... ... continues the way it 's going right now . Because it is Joe Louis with a left to the mid section and a right to the head . Another right to the head . And Schmeling now ... One ! The two fighters get back in there ... ( CROWD CHEERING ) Schmeling is down . He rolled out on the canvas . Yeah ! Joe Louis has sent Schmeling down . He staggered . He 's dazed . He 's not quite sure where he is . It is Louis moving in for the kill . Louis with a right to left . Louis with another left hand . Louis with a right hand , and Schmeling goes down . ( SPEAKING GERMAN ) ANNOUNCER ... ... Schmeling is down . Joe Louis trying to gain revenge . The corner man now getting up . He throws the towel in the ring . He throws the towel away . The referee trying to get back . It 's all over . It 's over . Joe Louis has successfully retained his heavyweight title to the world with a time of two minutes and four seconds in the first round . Joe Louis with his gloves held high . Max Schmeling helped into his corner . Joe Louis has won the rematch with Max Schmeling . It is all over . JEFFREY ...

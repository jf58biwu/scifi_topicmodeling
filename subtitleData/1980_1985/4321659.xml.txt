 Afghanistan is a volatile place . He 's Italian . Am I so horrible to behold ? I 'm Italian . You know , you got a hell of a lot of nerve . Where 's Jo , and where the hell are these guns going ? FRANK : To a rebel camp . Jo 's already there . Has Frank ever brought any other women here ? They 're discussing whether to execute us at dawn , or do it now . Saint John , run ! Now you 're mine . Don 't count on it . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) You 're late . I do not like to be kept waiting . I had to dodge the patrols on the road . This is what 's available . Two dozen of these . A very useful item . 100 of those . No problem . Yes . I have no trouble finding a market for this . We have a deal then . I 'd better head out before the sun comes up . I was hoping this trip , you 'd provide me with something a little bit more exotic . Something unusual . These are the best weapons available . I see the photograph that you carry . The golden one . Show me . Some things , Mustafa , are not for sale . Everything is for sale . It is only the price that is in question . I think we can arrange something . Yes . This is what I want . Go . She seems to be in top form . JO : Everything checks out in the electronics . All right , now I can leave you guys without worrying . It 's going to be kind of lonely around the old homestead with you guys going off in all directions . You can change your mind and come with me . Watching a bunch of guys spinning their wheels is not my idea of a holiday . Jo , it 's the Baja 1000 . It is the greatest off-road motorcycle race in the world . Yeah . Right . Thanks . I think I 'll pass . Let 's check out the atmospheric on this bird . Take her up to altitude . SAINT JOHN : Cabin pressure normal . Oxygen mix good . I think we can give her a clean bill of health . Telegram . Telegram for Miss Jo Santini . Who 's it from ? Does the name Frank Casabello ring a bell ? ( CHUCKLES ) Frank ... SAINT JOHN : Jo , are you all right ? I 've got a readout that says your heartbeat is way off the meter . You mean it skipped a few beats ? Don 't worry . What 's the message say , Mike ? " Urgent . Miss Jo Santini . " Come to the Casbah Hotel , Kabul . " Now , catch this , Saint John . " Love , Frank . " What was that ? MIKE : Love , Frank . You know , Afghanistan is not exactly the first place that I would pick for a romantic rendezvous . And what 's wrong with Rome , or Paris , or London ? Well , I know a great place in New Jersey if you 're on a tight budget . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Frank 's in Afghanistan , so Afghanistan it is . Anyway , he 's made reservations . There 's a plane ticket waiting for me at the airport , and I 'm going . I think it 'll be fun . I know it 'll be fun . ( MIMICKING ) ( MOCKING ) " Love , Frank . " Frank . ( BOTH MUTTERING ) Look , Jo , seriously . Afghanistan is a volatile place . You 've got Soviet troops occupying part of it on one hand ... Armed insurgents on the other hand . And if that 's not enough fun for you , there 's always bandits . What can I say ? He 's Italian , I 'm Italian . We have romance in our blood . And he 's a very fascinating man . He sounds like the kind of guy we 'd like to meet . Why don 't you invite him here ? Yeah . He probably can 't get away from work , which seems to be a problem I 'm having . Will you cut me some slack , guys ? You sound like parents on my first date . Well , at least he 's got a job . That 's good . Oh yeah ? What kind of job ? He 's a relief coordinator for Global Medical Aid . So I 'll have diplomatic immunity . Besides , there 's a temporary ceasefire there right now . ( CAR HONKING ) You guys can hold down the fort without me . I 'm off to the Casbah . Jo , are you sure about this ? Afghanistan ? That 's crazy . Crazy . SAINT JOHN : Jo , will you at least be careful over there ? This place is not exactly the Club Med . Club Med ? I mean , it 's a hotbed over there , Jo . Come on . ( SIGHS ) I 'll send you postcards . ( CAR HONKING ) ( BIDS FAREWELL IN ITALIAN ) Ah , why don 't you go with her ? What are you , crazy ? Number one , she 'd probably kill me . Number two , I 'm going to the motorcycle races . And number three , why don 't you go with her ? What are you , crazy ? First of all , she 'd probably kill me , and secondly ... Well , I 've got an assignment in China . I don 't like it . I got a really weird feeling about this . Yeah . She hasn 't seen the guy in three years , and suddenly it 's wham , bam , Afghanistan . ( EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST ) Hey , it 's too bad they don 't have motorcycle races over there , huh ? Yeah . Yeah . Got a lot of sand . Oh , sand , yeah . Lot of good dirt . Oh , tons of dirt . Yeah . Oh , no ! No . No way . What are you , crazy ? Number one , she 'd probably kill me . And number two , if she caught me snooping ... If I 'd wanted a babysitter , I 'd have looked at the goddamn classifieds . I agree . This was Mike 's idea . I could have been ... You two have a hell of a lot of nerve . The most insensitive ... You 're right . Mike 's insensitive . ... unfeeling ... Concerned . Jealous . Jealous ? Yeah , jealous . Mr. Frank said he will pick you up later . And would you please wear this ? It is a costume of the people of the highlands . It will make you feel more at ease and not stand out as a tourist . Well , thank you very much . Now this is a thoughtful gesture . You should be taking notes . Could you tell Mr. Frank ... He didn 't even wait for his tip . I guess some people know when three 's a crowd . Well , if you and Frank would like to join me later for a drink , it would ... No . Bad idea ? Mmm-hmm . Okay , well , be careful . And I 'll see you later . Not if I see you first . ( EASTERN INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING ) ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) ( SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) Hey , you look like the kind of guy who just lost his heart or his wallet . Let 's hope it isn 't your wallet , huh ? No , I 've still got a firm grip on both . Excellent . Uh , could you stake a fellow American to a drink , hmm ? Uh-huh . Bartender , you wanna give him one on me ? So , I guess you have been around the block a few times , huh ? Around this neighborhood , that could get you the Purple Heart . James McKiddon . Correspondent , New York Times . Make that the New York Sometimes . Assignments have been a little scarce , you know ? A journalist , huh ? Look , maybe you can help me out . Have you ever heard of a guy named Frank Casabello ? Frank Casabello . May he rest in peace . You mean he 's dead ? You sure ? Dead sure . I filed the story last week . He got killed running medical supplies to the highlands . Ambushed by bandits . Jo ! You know , you look to me like the kind of guy who lost his heart or his wallet . Hey ! Are you absolutely sure that Frank Casabello 's dead ? I am a journalist . I don 't get paid to make things up . You saw his body with your own eyes ? Yes , and it wasn 't a very pretty sight either . You got someplace I can use a phone ? Certainly . Bartender ! Telefono . ( PHONE RINGING ) MIKE : Santini Air . I can hardly hear you . Speak up . Mike , I need a background check on this Frank Casabello . Ditto for his company . That was Global Medical Aid , right ? What 's going on ? I don 't know . It 's all smoke and mirrors to me . Jo 's disappeared , and this Frank guy is apparently dead . Get back to me on this as soon as you can , will you ? I 'm at the hotel Casbah . Will do . Time for you and me to take a walk around the block . I don 't see how I could possibly help you . You 're gonna take me to this Frank Casabello 's place of business . Let 's go , Mike . This 'll just take a minute . We have an assignment . I just want to run the check for Saint John . Jo might be in trouble . Okay , well , let 's do it in the air . We still have to search for that downed satellite , and I have a feeling it 's not gonna be easy to locate . At least China 's in the right general direction . It looks to me like they shut down the operation , huh ? ( WHISPERS ) Shh ! Listen ! I hear voices . It 's the first sign . Next , you start seeing things . Get over here . Get up there and take a look . Come on . What do you see ? I see two men loading a truck . What else ? Wait . There 's a third man . I can 't see his face . He 's not a native . He 's ... He 's alive ! ( GROANS ) Who is ? Is it Frank ? You swore you saw him dead ! I 'm a journalist . I can 't risk my life to confirm a story . They 'd cut my tongue out if they caught me . I need my tongue to talk . Words are my living . Look , listen closely . I don 't wanna be misquoted . Go back to the bar . Gladly . I 'm expecting a call . When it comes in , tell my friend one word . Airwolf . Airwolf , Airwolf , Airwolf . What is it again ? Airwolf ! ( SHUSHING ) Hey , hey , hey . I need some money for the bar . Office rent money , huh ? Will you stop ? There . Go . ( CHUCKLES ) You ... Go ! Airwolf . Airwolf . Airwolf . LOCKE : Well , well , well . Jo 's flame is a man of many names . He 's running from something . Well , I hope for her sake it 's not a string of alimony payments . Man , oh , man . This guy 's been back from the grave more times than Dracula . Odds are that he 's popped open another crypt in Afghanistan . I 'll see what I can find out on that medical supplies outfit he works for . If it deals in blood , I 'm gonna faint . You again . What is it with you and sneaking around , kid ? Mr. Frank Casabello , I presume . I don 't believe I 've had the pleasure . And you , my friend , have me at a disadvantage . That all depends on your point of view . Could you tell me where I am ? Just a clue . Uh ... I think I 'll pass on the tour for tonight . I 'm a little tired . Guys ? Oh . Have you seen Frank ? Oh , great . Uh , I suppose a bath would be out of the question , huh ? I just wanna freshen up a bit before I see Frank . No ? Hi . Thank you . Is this for me ? Are you sure ? Oh , my God . It 's gorgeous . Is this a gift from Frank ? Silks . Oh , I 've never seen anything so beautiful . Are you sure this is all for me ? There must be some mistake here . ( GASPS ) A hot bath . Girls , you read my mind . It 's unbelievable . You know , this is just like Frank . Why didn 't you say so ? Any friend of Jo Santini is a friend of mine . Exactly where is our mutual friend ? Don 't worry about Jo . She 's in safe hands . Sorry about the gun . Around here , you can 't be too careful . Medical supplies fetch a good price on the black market . Listen , just let me talk to Jo so she can tell me herself that she 's all right . You can get back to whatever it is you really do around ... Kid , I don 't believe you . Why don 't you come with me ? I 'm just taking a shipment of supplies to Habib 's village . Truck 's already loaded and ready to go . All right , let 's go . ( PHONE RINGING ) ( MUTTERING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) Call for a Mr. Hawke . Saint John Hawke . Call for Hawke . ( MUTTERS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) ( GROANS ) ( CLEARS THROAT ) Yeah , give me a double , huh ? Now when they say luxury , I know what they mean . Um , could you tell Frank I 'll be ready in a minute ? Thank you . Oh . Uh ... Well , I 've waited this long , I guess a few more minutes won 't hurt . Are these Afghan dates ? Um , tell me , just between us , has Frank ever brought any other women here ? No . How could he ? He couldn 't afford it . No answer from Saint John . What now ? LOCKE : Nothing we can do . We can 't abandon our assignment just because Jo has fallen for a shady character . I hate to mention it ... I know , I know . Book of rules , right ? The worst thing that can happen is Jo will suffer a broken heart when she discovers the guy is running from something . Yeah . Well , hearts and rules were meant to be broken . Well , if you don 't have anything better to do , why don 't you find out what the best route to Afghanistan is from here ? You got it . At least without headlights we 're not an easy target . Nope . We don 't want to get stopped on this road , do we , Habib ? No . My people need medicine badly . Habib 's people are freedom fighters . They 've suffered great losses at the hands of the Russians . Frank is a brave man to bring the supplies to my people . You 've seen much action , Hawke ? More than I ever cared to . How old are you , Habib ? Fifteen . I 've already fought four years as a soldier . One day , we will live free . When I was 15 , my biggest worry was making the football team . Well , it 's been very nice talking to you . Thank you . But if Frank doesn 't show up soon , I 'm not gonna be in any shape to celebrate . ( ALL LAUGHING ) You are even more beautiful than your photograph . Oh , thank you . What photograph ? ( STUTTERS ) Wait ... Hold it right there . I 'm ... I 'm very impressed . I mean , it 's very nice and hospitable , but have you seen Frank anywhere ? He 'll be here for the ceremony . What ceremony ? Our wedding . Our wedding ? Are you crazy ? Over my dead body ! You may want to reconsider . That was a warning . Next time , you 'll be trading stories with Allah . I like a woman with fire in her soul . Guards ! Stay cool . Soviets . I hope you got a plan , Frank . No problem . My documents should get us through this . I have United Nations clearance . We carry only the medical supplies allowed . ( SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) ( BOTH SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) ( SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) You bastard , Frank . ( GROANS ) If we get out of this , you 're gonna have to deal with me , Frank . Don 't worry about that . They 're discussing whether to execute us at dawn , or do it now . Habib ! That was close . I want some answers , and I want them fast . Where 's Jo , and where the hell are these guns going ? To a rebel camp . Jo 's already there . Medical supplies only patch up the dying . Guns liberate the oppressed . Any more lies out of you , and I 'll liberate your head from your neck . No more lies . You saved my life . Now let 's get out of here . ( BEEPING ) A man who lies cannot change his habits like a snake sheds its skin . I agree , Habib . You watch my back , and I 'll watch yours . We 're over the satellite crash site now . Looks like heavy weather down there . We could set her down , but it 'd be rough . You wanna chance it ? No . At least we 've located it . If we can 't retrieve it , neither can anyone else . ( BUZZING ) Hold on . I 'm getting an I.D. Emergency signal from Saint John . I 'll punch in the graphics . MIKE : How far to Afghanistan ? LOCKE : We 'll be taking a hell of a chance . If they detect any American presence , we can expect some heavy retaliation . I know I heard an " if " in there somewhere . Okay . I 'm worried about Jo . Head for the border . You 're not a man . You 're an insect . You 're a cockroach . Your insults and defiance only excite me . I have a certain charm . You will weaken . Don 't count on it . When Frank gets here , you 're gonna pay for this . Frank has already been paid , and very well . You brought him a good price . What ? You 're lying ! Frank would never do anything like that ! Believe what you wish . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Look at me ! Am I so horrible to behold ? ( SPITS ) I will break your spirit . I will have you . Mike , what 's our location ? I 'm just getting a fix on that now . All right , here we go . We just crossed over the northern border . And we got a definite confirmation on that one . LOCKE : I got Ivan closing in on Saint John . We better get there first . In that case , let 's get a move on . Right . Activate turbos . That 's your camp ? Yeah , we 're here . Now , let me introduce you to my friends . Skip the preliminaries . Where 's Jo ? Hey , soon enough . Come on , let 's have a drink . I wanna see her now , Frank . I 'm afraid I can 't risk having you interfere in my business here , Mr. Hawke . These gentlemen will keep you company . Fellas . ( GROANS ) Jo ! My God ! Where the hell have you been ? Untie me ! Forgive me , I never intended for this to happen . Mustafa swore he 'd treat you well . How could you have asked me to come here ? I guess I had that coming . I 'm not a piece of property . You get me out of here now ! Don 't you dare touch me ! Listen , Jo , getting out of here may not be that easy . They have your friend Hawke prisoner . I tried to stop them , but I couldn 't . Saint John 's here ? Mustafa betrayed us . I only wanted to see you , and I made a tragic mistake . One of many . Frank , how could you ? It 's very complicated . Try me . ( GRUNTING ) A gunrunner . All this time I believed you were working for a medical relief unit , and you 've been dealing in guns ? First time we met . Guatemala . Do you remember ? Yeah , I remember . I tried to tell you then . But I was afraid if you knew the truth , you 'd have nothing to do with me . You would have been right . Frank , how could you get involved in this business ? ( SIGHS ) When you live your life in war zones , you see horrors that you never forget . At first you 're shocked . Then the horrors become routine . Finally , my mind became a war zone . To survive you have to adapt . I 've become what I 'm surrounded by . Life has no value . To the point where you 'd sell not only guns , but people ? You sent for me because you sold me . I sent for you because I needed help . I loved you . You were the only person I still cared for , who I hoped cared for me . Please . Please help me , Jo . These are not rebels . They 're bandits , murderers . My friend Jo , where is she ? They have her prisoner in one of the tents . Frank is with her now . Frank . Well , she 's in trouble . We 've got to get her out of there . There . We 're coming in on a camp . Let 's go . I 'll get in for a close-up . We 're short on time . Okay , then let 's go in for a quick sweep . Mustafa 's coming . You have explained our deal to her ? There is no deal . Tell him , Frank . No deal ? I have your money . How could you ? Goodbye , Jo . You bastard ! Now you 're mine . Don 't count on it . Keep an eye out for ground assault . They may have enough firepower to knock us out of the sky . It 's Frank . He is escaping . Habib , wait ! Frank ! ( ALL CLAMORING ) This is not Russian . I 've never heard such a sound . Friends of mine . Come on . Airwolf ! LOCKE : There 's Jo . Let 's lay down some ground cover . ( SCREAMS ) The rocket launchers ! Get her out of here ! MIKE : Keep pouring it on . LOCKE : Come on , guys . Get out of the line of fire . Run , Saint John , run ! Run ! MIKE : They made the truck . They 're out of range . LOCKE : Yeah , but we 're not . MiGs at six o 'clock . LOCKE : All right , let 's go pick up the family . Nice driving , Habib . The Airwolf 's on its way . You got a free ticket to the States if you want it . I 'll stay here . I cannot leave my people . We won 't forget you , Habib . Thank you . Goodbye , Miss . So long , Hawke . So long , Habib . We 'll do everything we can to make sure your village keeps getting medical aid . These supplies should help for a while . Well , goodbye . Nice kid . I 'm not sure he ever had a chance to be a kid . How are you feeling ? Eh ... I just can 't believe I bought Frank 's line for so long . He had a lot of people fooled . Yeah , but I never took the time to find out who he really was , you know ? I just saw what I wanted to see . Well , you 're not alone on that score . Frank was slick . He almost had me fooled . He did ? Yeah . I almost turned around and went home . You started all that talk about staying out of your personal life , and ... Hey , you were right . It 's just that I needed some time off , you know ? A little romance , I guess . And time to recharge my batteries . That 's all I meant . Well , next time you need your batteries charged , please don 't do it so far from home . Okay . Ah . Um , listen , I know I made a big deal out of you guys interfering in my personal life , but whose idea was it to follow me in the first place ? Mike . Saint John 's . ( SPEAKING SIMULTANEOUSLY ) Wait a minute , wait a minute , wait a minute . I 'm not blaming anyone . I just wanted to say , whoever it was , thanks for interfering . Well , actually all of us . Oh , then anytime . It 's fine . You 're welcome . Well , I mean , honestly , I mean , really , I 'd do it for everybody I 've met . As a matter of fact , I 'd do it for you . If I remember correctly , it was my idea . It was my idea . No , it was my idea . Your idea ? How could it be your idea ? I was the one responsible . I made it happen . You remember me talking about Afghanistan ? ( ALL ARGUING SIMULTANEOUSLY ) And then I didn 't get to go at all . He had to go to Afghanistan . I missed the whole damn thing . I am really disappointed . I only come in once a week , but it was my idea .

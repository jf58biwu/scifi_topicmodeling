 A strange case ... A stranger steals corpses and tries to buy discreetly . Involuntary witness of the murder of Belloni , a nightclub owner , Patrick , a young intern hospitals , becomes involved in this gruesome trade . Forced to become effectively provider of bodies for the love of a young woman , Coretta , Patrick , after long days of waiting , successfully removed from the morgue the body of a young woman . He delivers the body to the unknown freeing Coretta from the threat that was weighing on her . - Hi , how are you ? - I 'm fine . Say , you 'd better be really nice to me . I 'm going to open a disco and I will buy a lot of discs from you . Oh , where ? What 's happening to you ? What 's happening to you ? Two cognacs , please . Two cognacs . Feeling better ? Yep . You made me afraid . Well , I mean ... I rather made you scared . This is the first time it happens to me . I 'm not used to this . But who are you ? Ah yes , who I am . Usually it is I who ask these questions . But why not . I am simply a jeweler . Look at her ! A ghost ! You alright ? I 'm alright . So , what happened to you ? - It would take too long to explain . Tell me , the boss , is he here ? - The boss ? But what boss ? - Belloni . - Belloni ? But it 's been at least 6 months the last time we see him . Oh . If you come to get back the job , do not count on it . I do not like so much being fooled by you , you see . Now I do not see what we could have to say to each other . It would suit me if you me let my finish my accounts . Listen . Don 't get angry Rita . I had problems . I need information . Tell me where Belloni is . I need to see him . We have not seen you since the day of his disappearance . I really thought you had something to do with it . But no . He could not be interested by someone like you . Bye . Another thing . You know ... They found his car . He is certainly dead . Next . But what are you doing here ? You could at least say hello . But I do not understand ... Hello you . You cannot remove your foot from there ? You 're puttin dirt on it . Listen to me . This is my work place here . You 're not starting again , I hope ! I intend to do my job . Do you understand ? I am not an adventurer ! So I ... - We had a deal , right ? - Well , I respected it , right ? - Take off your clothes . - Ok . You really want me to undress ? It is necessary for me to examinate you , right ? Ok . No , you can stop there . I think there 's a misunderstanding between us . Tell me . Hey ? You know the Tabarle ? No , never heard of . When I think that she takes herself for a star , that one . Really . Wait . Physically you 're in great shape . It has not left much marks on you not seeing me for 6 months . At your ease . And I hope you have registered to Social Security now because you owe me 30,000 francs . Stop . You annoy me . No . If I 'm here , it is because of an incredible event . Belloni , he 's the guy that we killed in the wasteland . That I killed if you prefer . I know . Excuse me . Believe me if you want but I met Belloni . He was a jewelry and I have his address . I beg you Patrick . Come . Miss . Sir . Can I help you ? I would like to see Mr Maubourdin . From Miss Coretta . If you want to follow me . It 's nice of you coming here . - Hello . - You brought a friend . Good afternoon . Mr Maubourtin , I ' m introducing you to Dr. Patrick Piaut . - Very happy . - Hello . Sit down . You want something to drink ? Yep . It 's always interesting to know a doctor . And you ... It 's a long time since you 're installed here ? No , not really . About 6 months . - I lived in Cambodia before . - You were living in Cambodia ? It 's funny because ... You probably know ... Claude and Marie Trémois . We lived in Northern Cambodia . In the jungle . Yes , but I 'm sure you know them . They owned French bookstore in Phnom Penh . Maybe ... It is mainly my wife who took care of that . I am ... I am awfully sorry . It 's okay . But ... But ... it 's your wife ? Yes . - It 's okay . - I am really sorry . I had a picture like that and I wanted to see if it could fit in the frame . What do you think ? Apparently , it 's not perfect but it can go , right ? Gendron Francoise born April 11 , 1951 , Paris 1st district , single . Her professional card remained hooked . There 's not much more . Well . We 've not made much progress . Yes . It 's a shame because I would have enjoyed meeting some of her relatives . Let me see this card . Union models . I was a model before . Maybe we can look in that direction . Coretta ! - I am glad to see you . - How are you ? Tell me . Am I disturbing you ? No . What 's going on ? I need information . Do you know a model named Françoise Gendron ? - It tells you something ? - No , but I 'm not good with names ... You don 't have a photo ? - Give her . - Thank you . No . I don 't think I know her . - You should try agencies . - I do not think they will agree to help me . It bothers me because I 'm in a hurry . - Ask to Roberte . - Who is Roberte ? I don 't know her She is the press secretary . Wait . I 'll get her for you . Good afternoon . You know this model ? Yes . I 've never worked with her but she is the girlfriend of Jack Hopkins , an American photographer . Thank you . It is kind of you to agree to accompany us . It may be a bit boring but I think it 's worth it . Do not thank me . I do it for Françoise . I had a great affection for her . We separated from each other with a number of difficulties . She loved me . Probably more than I loved her . When she died it gave me a shock . Certainly more than what I had imagined . Listen . I know it will be difficult but it would be better if you could hide your emotions . I brought a camera . I would like to use it if you do not mind . Ok . We go ? Ok . - Hello . - Hello . - Hello . - I brought a friend , John Hopkins . You have done well . Pleased to meet you . Well . Let 's go . This is my wife . - Mister ? - Hopkins . - Mr Hopkins . That 's it . Patrick and Coretta . Good afternoon . Really . You have a beautiful house . I wish I had a pool like that . You want to try it ? - I do not have a swimsuit . - It doesn 't matter . There 's everything we need upstairs . I 'm with you for that matter . OK ! This is curious . You do not seem to be French . And yet ... I met a French woman much like you . You know . I traveled a lot with my husband . And I daresay that few people have traveled through the same distances . You think I have an accent ? No . Not much . You know ... I really want to photograph you . I 'm very flattered . Mainly because you are a professional . But it bothers me . You should not . Let me do . It 's my job . Yours is to be . But tell me . Why ? Why does it bother you I do not know . Perhaps because I 'm not used to it . You want something to drink ? Yes . Some whiskey please . Thank you . With a little coke please . What have you done ? What do you mean ? But this ! With the bottle . I assure you . It 's nothing . We go ? It 's good , huh ? Patrick , come ! No ? Why don 't you come ? What 's the matter ? I made you afraid ? This is the second time that it happens . It becomes a habit , don 't you think ? I 'm sorry . I can 't stand scars . When did it happen to you ? It seems recent . You know . Jeweler is a bit of an adventurer job . This , it is in South Africa . That , in Oceania , I think . That , it 's a bullet while looking for stones in Colombia . And it hurts It hurts a little when I 'm breathless . Oh yeah ? You must come to see me . I will X-ray you . I do not understand . With such a wound this guy should be dead . Come and see . Look . This is crazy . Hopkins joined a letter . He says it is an amazing case of resemblance . But after meeting Ms. Maubourtin he doesn 't think that it is the same person . What does all of this mean ? Good afternoon . I wanted to see you precisely . But finally I 'm a little bit late . I must go home . - It will be for another time . - Could you give back what you stole from me ? - But I ... - Please . But , I ... Shit ! What 's going on ? What 's this I assure you ... Thank you very much . I understand . I have not heard from anyone . I just called . There is something going on . It would be better not to attend the meeting . No . I need to know what happens . - I will go alone . It 's better . - Okay . But you must keep me informed . Alright . I 'll call you . It cannot last more than two or three days . You promise me ? You will be reasonable ? I admit that it is not unpleasant to be served like that after a day 's work . How ? It 's nice from you . You see , you 're ready for marriage . In addition to the chance of having me with you . If I were you , I would not hesitate a second . I 'm suspicious . Until now you got me accustomed to a lifestyle which does not coincides with the regular life of an honest man . Listen to me . You know what I suggest ? What ? That you have much worries because of me . After all I 'm also an extraordinary case . In the end you may be right . Coincidence or not ... After all it is not my problem . And I do not care . Eat . - Shit ! - No , don 't answer . No . I need to go . - No . - Stop it . I must go . Who was it ? Guess . I don 't know . I know nobody . Monbourdin ? You almost won . It was his wife . Really ? And then ? She doesn 't feel very well and wants me to go see her . They don 't have a doctor closer to their home ? We are at least 30 Km from them . I know , but ... Listen ... I moved in . I need to get clients . You see what awaits you , doctor 's wife . That 's it . It 's been 8 days now . He did not phone ? Nothing . He did not leave an address ? Yes . At the Prince of Wales hotel for his congress . But it 's been 8 days since he was seen there His stuff is still in his room . He did not call nor prevented . Nothing . Maybe he 's with friends , right ? We have no friends . And you did not think to call the police ? No , I ... I 'd rather not . Fine . For tonight I brought you this . You take two . Do not abuse it and then tomorrow you will pick this in a pharmacy . Listen . I need to request something from you . Yes . This is a little bit embarrassing but ... do not leave me alone . How ? Please . Not tonight . I could not . I 'm scared . Do you understand ? I 'm scared . This house makes me anxious . I feel I 'm going to crack . Stay . Please ! Listen ... Do not stress yourself . You have nothing to fear here . Here ... Take this sedative . My husband left me . Anything can happen . You do not feel it ? There is nobody for miles . I am completely exposed . What do you mean ? After all ... You are a little more than a doctor for us . If something happens to me you will not forgive yourself . You 're here . For me it is essential . I hope you will have a good night . The bathroom is there . See you tomorrow . Feeling better ? Not much . You took what I gave you ? No , I 'd rather not . I 'm afraid he will not come back . I do not understand why you 're so anxious . It 's silly what I am saying . It is difficult to control when you love someone . I love my husband ? What will you imagine there ? To love ! To love ! It 's always in your mouth here . I do not even know what it means . If it 's only by interest ... - Excuse me . I do not know what I say . - Do not apologize . Interest does not make more sense for us . I do not want to stay alone . That 's all . At this point ? You cannot imagine at which point If he does not return I do not think I will live long . Listen ... I 'll ask Coretta to come and keep you company tomorrow . It is very nice but you can not understand . You cannot help me , you know . I can . There 's always a solution . Oh no . It surpasses you too far . I would have to explain so much . I 'm on earth like I 'm in a huge empty room . At first glance the morning I see nobody . Nobody except me . I want to scream . You do not really have reasons to discourage . Look . You have a beautiful home . You are young . You are beautiful . You have the chance to cry at night beside a swimming-pool . Under a beautiful sky full of stars . Are you kidding ? Everything relies on the point of view where you 're located . I don 't mean literally . What do you mean ? Not literally ? This is a very unusual sensation to contemplate the place where we come from . The place where you come from ? Stop pretending you do not understand . I could simply tell you that I usually see Earth , your Earth , like you , you see the star up there . Skies are not so beautiful . Believe me . Stars ... I know them ... That 's where I come from . Really ? - As if you did not know ? - It had escaped me . Listen . Seriously . What do you mean ? How so ? What I mean ? I 'm not stupid anyway . I assure you that I do not understand a word of what you say . But you did an investigation about my husband and myself . Do not worry , please . It 's no use . Patrick ... You have still noticed certain phenomena , say , a bit strange , no ? Nope . You still have understood that my husband and I are occupying bodies that don 't belong to us . But make an effort ! Please remember what you have experienced in recent months . Let 's admit . But still ... What 's the connexion with the stars ? - Do not laugh . Please . It was not my intention to hurt you . I am an exiled , Patrick . But yes ... An exiled of a kind that you you can not even imagine . I mean that ... I do not belong to your Earth . I am not a human being . People of our galaxy have decided to evacuate on Earth all their problems . That is us . The EXI . They first considered genocide . And then they chose deportation . The idea is to treat the Earth as a trash can . A dump . Charming ! The earth is not heaven , but it is not that bad anyway . It would even be beautiful , Earth , if you were not there . You humans . No , I 'm not talking about prisons , the concentration camps , wars etc ... I mean all of you in general . You have polluted the Earth so much that only you can live here . This is what has kept you so long from the invasion . It would be unfair to blame you . You will talk to environmentalists about the usefulness of pollution ! Fortunately for us we noticed that your bodies could be used . It was obviously the machines better adapted to the environment and almost completely inoculated against all poisons . In short ... You use the human body as frogmen use diving-suits . Go in search of my husband . Remember ... Françoise Gendron , Belloni ... Everything must be clear now in your head . Hello sir . Is Mr Maubourdin here , please ? No , sorry Sir . He is not here . You know when I could reach him ? No idea . We have not seen him for several days . Every morning two men come asking for him and leave a message . The two men have already come this morning ? No , but they will come soon . They are normally here around 11 hours . I understand . Listen ... I 'm going to wait in the lobby . When these two men come could you make a discreet sign to me ? But of course , Mr. Count on me . Thank you very much . Follow that car . This is not my specialty . Come on , do not worry . This is a joke . Really ? You should have told me before . Brace yourself . I 'm your man . Wait for me here . - So ? - We keep on the chase ! - You 're sure this is a joke ? - Of course , you will see as we laugh . - Someone here ? - We come , we come . - Hello , Mr. - Mr . I 'll take ... a beer . Thank you . Tell me ... - There 's no cemetery in the village ? - No . To be buried you have to go to Tourcy . Is it far away ? - 1.5 km . - So , Fernand , it 's coming ? We come . Is this enough ? Hey ! All the village is a cemetery . - How ? - Since the plant is closed all people have left . You would not come to but it again by any chance ? No , no ...

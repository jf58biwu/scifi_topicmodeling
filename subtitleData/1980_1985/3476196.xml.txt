 A sunny weather this week end for all the south west region with for the afternoons , higher temperatures than usual See you tonight at the " Chaudière " café ? - Yes ! Momo ! Momo ! Hush ! Come on , what 's going on ? It 's saturday ! Not saturday ! Yes , it 's saturday ! Do you want some help ? Come on ! Not saturday ! Not saturday ! Here it is . The hardest is done . Now take off your pullover and trousers . Listen Momo . You 're 30 for 2 years already , When you 're 30 , you can wash by yourself ! Do you understand that ? The bottles are clean ? - Yes almost all ! I don 't think it 's for today . Tomorrow ? No . And the sow ? I go . Germain , can you bring me a lamp ? I got one in the bag . " Pervenche " is still the most beautiful . You should put back the wall here . A maternity ward must be clean . I go put my wine in bottles . If you want to come and taste it ... More news at eleven . Hello , Mr Mayor . - Hello . If you 're thirsty ... - With pleasure . These stamps come from far away . Are you collecting them ? - Not me , but my son . I 'll keep them . - Thank you . Hello . Do I disturb you ? Even the chemist ? It 's a delegation . Not at all . These gentlemen dragged me here . So ? We asked Mr Bouvreuil to come , so you can make an agreement together . Do you want to go in the kitchen ? - No , no ... I got nothing against this project , but look ... They want to put a streetlight right here . near my bedroom window . We could move it a bit , no ? We modified this blueprint 17 times , so we can go on . But I remind you ... That we can 't move the streetlight on the left because on the left there 's the cross from your shop and on the right there 's " Doctor Bouvreuil street " You don 't want us to put the light in the middle of your father 's street . Don 't expect my vote on this . That 's not possible . You know we need your vote for this project . I got a solution . If your shop 's cross was under your bedroom window would you see any inconvenience ? No because I turn it off when I close the shop . Perfect , so we put the light instead of the cross and you put the cross under your window . Who 'll pay for that ? The council . Except if you 're against it . Someone have to pay anyway . - Anyway . Is it solved ? Would you mind writing down this change . Do you want to taste my wine ? - Thank you . Where are the glasses ? Australia ? Can I dare to ask you the stamps ? I already promised them . Will your son come back for a bit ? - In autumn . He says hello ! Mr Mayor ... - Cheers ! Another power failure . Wait ... I got a lighter . Strange , there 's nothing . The batteries are good . I go . It 's dangerous . It 's dangerous . It 's dangerous . It 's dangerous . Wait ! Dog . " Tempest " . Dog . " Tempest " . " Tempest " . Dog . " Tempest " . Momo ! But what did you see ? Wait for me ! That 's the only thing left . Momo ! Momo Come ! Yes . Momo , yes ! May be we could start to talk again . I go take some wood . That 's not good to let the dead stink . It 's wrong . It 's dangerous . - No , move ! It 's dangerous . On the right ! Straight on ! Straight on ! On the left ! I though it was worst . You shouldn 't do this . If you 'd fell we 'd have no horse . I had to do this . If it was you , you should have done it . You left him to die outside , like a dog . What does he eat since he left ? What does he drink ? He 'd came back if he didn 't find anything . Anyway , leave my horse alone . My horse , your horse , his horse . Are you crazy ? It 's hard to get understood . I meant the opposite . Everything here doesn 't belong to me anymore . The " Periwinkle " belongs to us all . You can 't leave with her without telling us . That 's just words ! - No . Come on . I was not thirsty like this before . Have you seen the mark on Colin 's shoulder ? No . I was like you , I had a family . Do you think it 's right not to talk about the others ? Yes , it 's better . Did you see something ? A horse is passing ? Emanuel . I think it 's too late . Someone took the mare . Damn ! And there 's a pig missing . A small one ? Not the Big one , of course . Look , the mare passed threw here . More ? - Im thirsty . Evelyne ? Evelyne . - No . Momo ! Leave him ! Momo ! Come Momo ! Come ! Come ! The river didn 't run there . Sure not ! Who knows where it goes . Who 's that ? - Don 't you recognise her ? Was she alone ? - Yes . Evelyne , where were you when it happened ? In the cave . What did you see ? A lightning . Then ? Then a lightning striked somewhere . Since , I can 't see . Will they come ? - Who ? The others . My mother went with them , Momo didn 't find her . We must wait to know . Do you think we 'll know , one day ? Why not ? If we 're not the only survivors . Did someone heard the news ? The morning before the ... Yes . They didn 't say a thing . We 'll probably ... have some news soon . Meanwhile , someone have to decide . There 'll be nothing left to eat soon . Why does she say that ? You 're right , we can 't share our food like this indefinitely ... You were the Mayor , so you can still be . Yes , very good . I got enough . - Talk ! A mandate should have a limited time so ... Let 's say , Emanuel is Malevil 's Mayor until we get some news . I 'm fully sastified . Fully . All the better . Come on , go to bed ! Don 't stay here , you ! Are you not worry about the mark ? What mark ? On your shoulder , it seems to get bigger . He had it at birth . His poor mother had the same . Come on ! You 'll not touch ? And think about washing yourselves tomorrow . What is she saying ? She says we stink . - She 's right . You didn 't knew him . It was Meneau 's husband 's . I go sleep outside . What are we doing about the fire ? If a plane pass by ? He 's right . Put some wood ! Did you hear ? Evelyne . Come see ! Come see ! Here ! They came back . My child ... My child , try to remember . On that day , when the lightning striked did it burned your eyes or didn 't you feel anything ? I don 't know . You don 't remember anything ? - No . Open your mouth . It 's " Bouvreuil " syrup . What are you giving her ? Dipotassic Clorazepate . It smells gas . Don 't you see anything ? Something shiny other there . And now ? The same . Did you like Eric ? - Yes . I 'm his father , you know . I didn 't know . You 're playing often with him in the cave . Not only with him . When the lightning striked , were you alone ? Yes . He couldn 't come , he was grounded . But where is he , Eric ? I don 't know . You don 't like it ? - I don 't know if the soil is still good . We 'll try anyway . What if the sun doesn 't come back ? We must keep trying . I found this for you . Emanuel 's son ? Did you knew him ? Yes , of course . He left no more than 5 years ago . His mother took him with her . Other there . If he knew his father 's alive , he 'd find a way to come . He 's a Radio nut too . We used to build radio sets together . I was ten . It must a boy ! When will this little vale be abble to mate with his mother ? In a year . Till then ... - Until then ... What ? Or they 'll find us , or we 'll be ... ( ? ) We have enough for 2 months . If we don 't eat much . And after these 2 months ? Or it rains and the water is good , or it 's rotten and we are too . It 's a male . Well done . We 're lucky ! Listen Bouvreuil , you don 't have to stay . Where do you want me to go ? If you stay ... Do like us wait for the rain , take a shovel ... and shut up . The vale . The vale . The vale . Evelyne . Don 't stay . Again . Evelyne . Take . France welcomes monarch from Sweden . Come see . Look . Who did this ? - It 's Colin ! Anyway your machine ... That 's not a good reason to break everything . You don 't need it anymore . It 's not it 's fault . Oh , no . Everything 's out . Is that a transmitter , you 're doing ? I 'm trying . May be he 'll hear us other there . In Australia . I don 't think so , he don 't enjoy it anymore . He told you ? - He wrote it . How will you make it work ? With the generator . You got gas . Some are lucky . 6 . Can you give me tokens ? 35 . You 're stealing 10 francs . You don 't play anymore ? - Oh no . It 's crazy how fast we loose money here . I want to tell you something . Colin decided , by himself , to do a transmitter . It may be good , it may be bad ... When we 'll use this transmitter it 'll burn gas We have in all 150 litres left . With this we can ... we can plough 10 hours . We must choose between the tractor or the transmitter . Pessou ? I 'm for the tractor , of course . - You can give me 10 litres ? Agree for 10 litres ? Yes , we still got the mare for ploughing . What about going to see at the " Bastide " with the tractor . You go first , to clear the way with your shovel ? So do we keep 10 litres for Colin ? Who 's against it ? We 'll see . If there 's some left . ( mumble ) ... wash yourselves . What is she saying ? She say , we stinks . - She 's right . If it rains , get inside . It may be dangerous . So ? If the film is black , the rain is rotten . Radioactive , tell it straight . - Radioactive . 55 , 56 , 57 ... 71 ... 78 It 's white . It 's alright . Can we go ? Mommy ! Mommy ! Mommy ! Mommy ! - She can see , Momo . What are you doing ? Are you mad ? I didn 't know . You see they 're all dead . Red Red Black Yellow Oh shit ! It should work . You should take them off , they 'll be overdone . No , it 's ok . They 're old , you know . Did you salt ? Will you stop turning around her ? She 's not a child anymore . See the fire ? No time . No time . No time . If he bothers you tell me . May be thrushes . Stop ! It 's not mature ! It 's not mature ! Stop ! Stop ! For God sake ! Becareful ! Stop this shit ! It 's nothing . We should rub him down with Arnica . We need a fith gun ? - If you want mine ... What was it ? We killed 3 . What was it ? Unfortunates . People stealing our wheat . Who was it ? No one we know . Alright . Do you remember the old shipwreck stories ? When there 's a raft , everybody wants to get in so the ones on the raft cut the other 's hands off What else could we do ? I don 't know . But they 're men , there 's not many left . We 're men too . We managed to survive and that 's all . Because we were lucky ? And then ? We must defend ourselves . I Who doesn 't think the same ? I think like you . How long since ... it happened . 6 months ? More ? I 've counted 7 full moons . In the begining , we couldn 't see a thing . It 's strange , not to be alone anymore . 18 , 19 , 20 They 're 22 . What are they waiting for ? Do you really think we have to go ? We can 't stay like this . Do you see us playing sentinels every nights ? And if they ask to talk ? Bring one back , we 'll see . He 's our messiah , you 're the one These 2 curs , we killed them like beasts but we buried them like men . When I ordered to shoot , I heard you whispering . You didn 't have to whisper ! Don 't forget our pact ! Our pact with God . God choosed us . We 're the only survivors on earth . And it 's here , and by us that the new roots of humanity 'll be born . Over . They got uniforms . Let 's go ? Not all of them . With the guns ? No . You think so ? Come closer ! Come on ! We 're from Malevil . Have you got I.D ? Bouvreuil , chemist . deputy mayor Colin our electrician We 'd like to see the one in charge . We killed 3 of them . How do we have to call your boss ? Mr Director ! Hands up ! Don 't Panic ! It 's forbidden to talk to the strangers . The supplies distribution is postponed ! We are the first survivors . Seat down . Where do you come from ? From Malevil . Where is it ? - 15 Km from here . How many are you ? - 8 . How did you find us ? Hunting the thieves . We heard your shots . What do you want ? Nothing , we just tough ... it was natural , considering the situation to let you know that you 're not the only ones to survive . I 'm chemist . Malevil , is it a village ? It was . There 's only a piece of castle left . I think Cathy 's from there . Do you want me to get her ? Have you got milk ? Yes . And wheat . And you ? Hello , Mr Colin . Do you recognise this man ? It 's the chemist . Mr Bouvreuil , we have a sick man here would you agree to see him ? Do you have any medecine ? Yes . I don 't know if they 're appropriate , but we have some . Certainly , I can . Thank you , Mr Director . I know how good you are . Thank you . Thank you . How did you do to find a doctor ? It 's hard these days . I hope it 's not measles . I 'm not lucky , really . I became a burden , Mr Director . He 's feeling a bit congested . That 'll not be survy ? We 're very well-fed here Doctor , you know . Mr Director is looking after us , just as his own children We 're all his children . I 'l'll be nothing . - Really Doctor ? I 'd like so much to come back . Can I see your medecine . That , very good . Rhinoglucinal , perfect . That 's what your friend needs . We got a sick woman too , you can save her . Take it . We 'll see again , one is enough for now . Thank you . Does your friend talks that much usually , or is it because of the fever ? No , he always talks that much . This should cure him . But I 'm worried , I must admit it . 2 spoonfuls mornings and nights . - Before each meals . We only take one meal , in the evening . So 2 spoonfuls in the morning , and 2 before the meal . ( inaudible ) Our prison . Very good . I don 't want to seem nosy , Mr Director but my duty would be to stay , your man 's health is worrying me very much . Perfect . I 'll get a room ready for you . - Thank you . I think it 's better like this . Tell at Malevil , that we 'll take good care or your doctor . We didn 't read this one ? - This one ? Let 's read this one . - Who was it for ? Mr Pascal Jaquet . C.E bank Callès . ( City ) Lot ( district ) Where 's that ? Do you me to read it or not ? - Read it . Read ! Read ! My dear Pascal . I 'must have left my umbrella in your car , I hope this mistake 'll have no consequences . Don 't forget to tell me , if you come on monday or saturday . I got a book to give you from Roland . ( ? ) We 're waiting for you . I 've seen it . I saw a woman locked up . I saw handcuffs in the bog . I tell you , this guy is a lunatic . And they have a locomotive . Shit ! You 're pissing me off ! Admit that you 'd like to open this loco for your transmitter . I don 't hide it , and I never will . Yes , I 'd like to have these batteries . but that 's no the point , I tell you this guy is nuts . I 'd rather shoot myself , than falling into his hands . What do you want us to do ? - I think we must go . With the guns ? - Of course , it 's better . No ? You should go to bed . They got women too . Didn 't expect this , you ? Didn 't expect this ? Momo ! It 's cathy ! It 's cathy ! If we 'd refuse to make love , he 'd beat us . Especially since you came , it 's worse than before . He met another psycho , he came with his gang He calls himself " the Commandant " . Every day , for hours , you have to repeat the same thing . We 're the only survivors . God wants us to have children . That he 's our Lord . But who 's " He " ? Fullbert , the Director . Did he let you go , or did you run away ? I ran away with Judith . He made her insane . He took her back ! Who 's that Fullbert ? I don 't know what he was doing before . He became the chief , just like that , right away . He made us bury the dead . What have you got to eat there ? There were goods in the train . Cans , a bit of everything . You know there was also the farm near the tunnel Oh , yes . The " Villedieu " . It 's Albert 's . Then he locked the supplies , with the handcuffs . We heard explosions , many times . Was it from you ? No . There were men in this train ? None of them tried to defend you ? Yes , José . It 's been a month now that he 's in jail . There was no one in the cell the other day . What you saw is not the jail . The real jail is a hole that big , at the bottom of the loco . What you saw is the women 's prison . It 's just obscenity . And this woman , with 2 children ? Emma ? She 's like the others . She 's crying . We hide ? No ! We though to be the last survivors too . Yes , it was more simple . You came to bring us our chemist back . Not only . What Mr Director wants is ... - I 'll tell myself ! Since we met by chance . Let 's make the most of it . I agree . It 's a trap . No , just precautions . I know you have milk . I 'm interested We have children at the tunnel . Did you bring the medecine ? 3 boxes , yes . There 's something we 'd like in your locomotive . Batteries . What for ? A transmitter . Let 's say the milk is for the medecine . What do you want for the batteries ? A pig . I see you know very well our resources . Alright . Evelyne , bring some milk . Is it enough ? - For a month , yes . We 'll see again . - May be . And the pig ? We 'll bring it when we 'll come to take the batteries . Good . We 're leaving . Are you ready Cathy ? No . So hurry up ! - No . You belong to the tunnel . You must follow us . Never . Never again . Policeman ! And Judith ? What did you do with her ? And José ? These gentlemen don 't care about our business . They know . I told them all your obscenities . Excuse her . Come on . If you kill Judith , I 'll kill you . Bastard . You 're a bastard . She won 't come . Leave . Kill him . Kill him . You want war ? No . But you 're not alone anymore . It 'll be less simple now . I could go with Pessou , you know . I want to see it myself . It is so ... Too bad , you didn 't listen to me . We 'd be peaceful now . We 'd liquidate Fullbert , we 'd be cushy And the tunnel people too . And the so called " Commandant " , what about him ? He 'd not have stopped us wandering around here ? One day or another , he 'd attack us with his gang , and ... We have to know how many guns they have . We don 't have to , we must ! This " Commandant " is probably no more Commandant than I am . I go see . That 's not war ! That 's not war ! since we gave them milk . We didn 't give them milk . It 's a trade . These gentlemen gave us 3 boxes of phials , that 'll make you feel good , and in return ... - We gave a milk can . You see ... if Emma were here ... With her kids . So what ? I 'm sure she 'd be the vet 's kind of girl . You think so ? - Yes . She 's beautiful , you know . And Judith 'd appeal to Emanuel . So that way , we could love each others peacefuly . I 've putted the other fire out . - Thank you . Excuse me . Where 's Momo ? - How could I know . Didn 't expect , hum ? Didn 't expect . Do you know what I was telling to Colin ? No . I said that at the tunnel , there 's a woman you 'd like . Her name 's Emma . Emma . General call . General call . General call . Amateur radio . Frequency ... . General call Becareful . Here they come . To the river . You loved him that much ? Oh yes . We don 't want to kill you , that 's enough like this . How many were you ? 12 , the others are dead . where do you come from ? I come from the " Bastide " . Any survivors there ? There were around ten . They 're dead ? The Commandant killed them . - Why ? The commandant attacked our convoy he killed my dad and recruit me . And you ? I 've seen you before . I 'm from the tunnel . Corporal François Léon . What were you doing with them ? It 's a Director 's order . He 's not dead this one ? What do you mean ? The Director prefer to send the others to death . Is Judith still in jail ? Yes . Except at night . What do you think about all of this ? It 's war . Do you know what the Commandant was doing before ? He was a doctor . Do you want war to go on ? What was planned ? We 're supposed to win . And then ? We 'd settle in Malevil . The Director actually , what is he doing ? He must wait the Commandant 's return . Keep an eye on him . We 're not many , but I 'll not let you live . You 're a man from before the disaster . You don 't deserve to survive . From now on the tunnel 's law will be the only law . If Malevil has survivors , they 'll obey . Or they 'll die . Any prayer to do ? No . The commandant ask all the prisonners to be judged at the same time . Very well ! Bring Judith . Since it 's a trial , I 'll give you a chance . You 'll interrogate Judith , if you achieve to make her confess her crimes I pardon you . Let José out ! I 'm listening . Did you disobey to the Commandant or to the Director ? I didn 't disobey . They raped me . Didn 't you refuse to smile to them ? Yes . You see . How do you explain that the Commandant didn 't kill the Director ? I cancel this question . The prisonner don 't want to come . How 's that , he don 't want to come ? The prisonner don 't want to come ? It 's Malevil ! Judith ! - Cathy ! You 'll not blame me for the alliance with the Commandant ? You 'd be all dead today . If I did pretend to be friendly . And you 're here , happy to welcome Malevil . Where 's the prisonner ? He 's there ! He 's there ! You were right , you know . The Commandant wanted to kill me . That 's why I told him about Malevil . Of course , I shouldn 't have . Anyway , it 's over now . José . He 's dead ? He didn 't want to live enough . Well done ! Poor Mr Bouvreuil . If he hadn 't been here ... we wouldn 't be together . What 'll become of us ? We 're here . Look ! The mule ! Reassured ? We 'll never have enough plates . We 'll have to build another house . Can you imagine how long we have to survive to replace all the ones who died ? Intervention unit n ° 7 speaking ! regroup quickly for immediate evacuation ! Don 't take anything with you !

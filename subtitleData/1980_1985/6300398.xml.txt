 OK Pantera 2 Prague , It 's Kobra 3 Zagreb is calling . Prague , Come in . OK Pantera 2 Prague , OK Pantera 2 Prague It 's Kobra 3 Zagreb is calling . Over . Pepik , can you hear me ? Over . Here is Kobra Panther 2 I hear you Miro , Come in . Here is Kobra Panther 2 I hear you Miro , Come in . Here is Kobra Panther 2 I hear you Miro , Come in . Hi Pepik , how are you ? Hi Miro , I 'm fine . Especially when I hear you . And how are you ? Thanks , I 'm all fight . Pepik how you succeeded at home ? Don 't say that badly , we are friends over radio , more than two years and we have never seen each other , yet . That 's a shame . Will you come at all ? Over . You 're right , it 's a shame . But I have good news for you . Finally , I 've talked my parents to it . Listen ! I will come ! Hooray ! You are awesome ! But I can go at the end of summer . Never mind Pepik , only important is , that you are coming . In Hvar is always nicely , and in aunt Lucija 's , quite extraordinary . And don 't forget ! The distinctive emblem - a callsign on the cap . How will you recognize that boy ? Callsign . Go Adam . Go to the boat . I 'll wait here . So how 's business , Marko ? So far so good . It 's like with you , you have , what you catch . You know how it 's going . Attention . Attention . That 's him ! How do you do , Miro . I 'm Fine . This is my sister . Hi Adam . Hi Miro . Hey . - Hey Bojena . Back to work . Help yourselves . - Thank you . - Thanks . Kate , sweetie . Give aunt the oil , there . Go . Good morning . Here you are . Come in . That 's him aunt Lucija Oh so you 're that Pepik . Welcome . Welcome . I hope that you will feel at home . Thank you ma 'am . I 'm aunt Lucija . Thank you aunt Lucija . These are the children of our neighbor Marko . Their mother is ill , So they came to us . Goodbye . My god ... My fishes are burning . Come on . Aunt Lucija really managed that . I will show you the house . This is main entrance . This is most famous member of our family . Our great-grandfather . Navy captain , scientist , painter , inventor . Ferdinand Kruzhich . They called him Dalmatian Leonardo da Vinci . More precisely . They mocked him like that . Yes . And they laughed because they were stupid . And could not understand him . He was with his knowledge at least a hundred years ahead . And then what is left to fools ? Taunts . You must understand Pepik . I don 't think anything wrong about our great-grandfather We were told about him that he was really wise and well-educated man . But he was little ... Eccentric . When he returned from the sea , he went up to the attic . To work on his inventions . Once , He blew up almost half of the roof . What key is that ? Mysterious key . It is also grandfather 's invention . Key from his attic . Yes . But no one can unlock anything with it . Unfortunately , she 's right . I tried to open the attic . But it was really impossible . I 'm still wondering about that strange key of your great-grandfather . And why ? There is , several mysteries . Firstly . What is this strange lock . Which is opened by a weird key . Secondly . I thought you said that your grandfather was an inventor . He must left a lot of interesting things on the attic . A third . Bojena says , the roof blew up , once . Right . But why ? If you are really so interested , We 'll lake the key and will try to get in . Bu ! I don 't believe it . I myself tried it a few times . And always in vain . When we do this together . We can succeed . Right . But in front of our aunt , not single word about it . She don 't let anyone to go to the attic Boys ? How do you like me ? You 're amazing , but too soon baby . Masquerade will be in February . Foul mouth . Pepik ? What do you say ? Hm ... I like you . See Miro . This is a true European flair . Shut up . And rather get washed thoroughly . Before aunt Lucija will see you . I told you , it will not work . Three arms . Three keyholes . That will be it . You 're an savvy guy . L got it ! In the first , turn once . In the second , twice . And in the third , three times . It makes sense . Try it One . Two . Three . Pepik , come here . Come here . What are you watching ? Marko 's handcart . One , two , three , five ... seven . Take a look . Interesting . What is it ? As I 'm looking at it ... It will not be a telescope . Miro Come take a look ! Some documents . Hold it . This is certainly a sketch . Of that strange device . I don 't understand it . Neither do I. Hey look , there is something about antigravity . Here . It is anti-gravity cannon . What language is it ? Looks like a German . Pepik , that is good . My sister Bojena was many times with my uncle Zdenko . In Hamburg . She speaks German quite well . What are you two doing here ? Above all , what are you doing here ? I 'm going . - Hi . Leave her alone , Miro , we will go home . Do you hear what your friend is recommending to you ? And what would recommend aunt Lucija to you ? If she saw you painted like that . And right here . And I would like to know what would aunt Lucija say , if someone whisper to her that you broke into the great-grandfather 's attic . How do you know that ? I saw you meddle around the attic door , detectives . So you know something about me , and I have something on you . So it 's 1 : 1 Now , please tell me . What do you want from me . We need something translated from German . It could not wait until tomorrow ? With whom I will dance now ? Can you dance ? Me ? Well ... But ... Yeah , Pepik , science has always asked for the sacrifices . This is the letter from the Minister of War of the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy . It was written in 1912 . Looks like great-grandfather sent them some plans . Of his invention . What invention ? Offering something like ... Something that relieves the weight of objects . Something like ... Anti ... Anti ... The anti-gravity cannon . Do you hear , cannon . That cannon , as grandfather Ferdinand writes here , it has a terrible power . You can pick up any object . A shoot it into the space . Into the space ? Listen what they wrote . Imperial - Royal Ministry of War responded . Based on a thorough analysis made by a Commission of Ballistic experts . Led by Professor Doctor Engineer Otto von Reisinger In short , they write , the grandfather 's invention is a product of abnormal imagination , unrealistic and utopian - . End of story . Fossils . Especially senile . They failed to understand Brother , you are mocking them . But it looks like that these gentlemen , had been right after all . What do you say , for example , to this nonsense . 60 Volt , 30 meters . 85 Volt , 40 meters . Mostly small objects , but some bigger Width of flow 6 degrees . 120 Volt , cat quickly raised up and disappeared . Bojena , please continue . - Yeah . Yeah . He writes 150 Volts , very strong flow and strong vibrations . If I had enough electricity or some similar force I will be able lift the load weighing several tons . So that 's probably enough , Pepik , isn 't it ? You know Bojena . Miro and I ... as ham radio operators , and people who know something about electrotechnology ... looks at these things a little differently than you . I think your great-grandfather was not a weirdo at all . On the contrary . I think he was really smart and capable man . I agree with Pepik . Oh great-grandfather Ferdinand , you got yours followers . But , be careful that you did not fly with the roof between the little green . Bye . First , we need new batteries . And where are Miro and Pepik ? What ? I asked you , where are Miro and Pepik . Hm ... They are bathing . This is good . Let them enjoy their vacation . Hi , Bojena . How are you ? I 'm fine , Adam . What about you ? Still in a rush ? You know I 'm , but I don 't mind . And how are your mother ? It 's better , much better . When you have time , Can You take us on a boat ? Of course . Just let me know . Come to change diapers . Bye Bojena , I must go . There is one more plus . And here is missing both , plus and minus . Done . Not before the barrel ! How can I know ? Both sides are the same . Here , look . According to the plan , that one at the window , is shooting . I see . You 're right . We need to mark is somehow . Not this . Miro . - That 's it . Now it 's clear . The red side is shooting . Will we turn it on ? Let 's go . Marko 's kariola . Turn it on . We made it . I probably should not drink so much . That Miro is not normal . What he did ? Instead of letting ... Pepik to enjoy the sea and to have some fun with us . He is stuffing some technical nonsenses , into his head . That is easy . You are such city children . You can 't enjoy the life . I 'm sure it was because those batteries , they are too weak . You saw it for yourself . They were discharged in few minutes . You 're right . Remember note by your grandfather . If I had enough electricity or some similar force I will be able lift the load weighing several tons . So , I got it . We will try to connect to the electric grid . That 's the idea ! What do you think , Pepik , is it OK ? Well , it looks good . Plug it in . Let 's go . Turning on . That 's a strength . Now this is it . What if he wakes up ? Don 't worry . I will come up with something . Here . Here . This way it will be best , I think Run . Come on . Inventors . You are not going to swim ? Not now , we have some work to do . Ah ... work . So that is something different . You 'll fly into the space between the little green men ? Stop provoking us . I 'm provoking you ? Hey boys , I 'm asking you completely seriously . When the Americans and Russians succeeded . So why you two , can 't succeed as well ? I 'm inviting you to swimming . You will see that it will be better . We are not interested . But you know what ? Here you go then . We invite you to a gala premiere called . The anti-gravity cannon in action . Gladly . I 'm getting interested in that yours circus . Do not get in front of red ! Sorry Bojena , but the red marked side is very dangerous . Main is , I stayed alive . Do you see Marko 's handcart on wharf ? Yes . Pepik . - Yes ? Turn it on . Turned on . Folks ! My kariola vanished ! Folks ! Folks ! My kariola flew away ! Help ! Folks ! Pepik . Miro . That 's terrible . Do you understand at all , how it is dangerous ? But you gotta admit ... that we did a big thing . No one must know . It must remain between us . Not a word . We promise not reveal anything . Give me your hands . Repeat after me . I swear on my honor I swear on my honor I 'll guard and never reveal I 'll guard and never reveal secret of great-grandfather 's invention . Never and to anybody . Secret of great-grandfather 's invention . Never and to anybody . He 's here . What is it ? Why they are singing it . What they are singing ? Quiet , people . Here 's our Marko . Tell us about the flying kariola . Tell everyone as it happened . How it happened ? I sit on the bench . As always , I 'm in duty on my workplace . It was shortly after lunch . A bottle of red in hand . Hey , don 't interrupt . The bottle was drained . I started a little catnap . When suddenly ... I open my eyes Jesus ! I see ! Well what ? My kariola began to float meter , two ... above the harbor . I wanted to say . It not hang up or down . And around it , little trembling . Lights . Like green , like blue ... Folks . Like green , like blue . And it was not perhaps , like red wine ? Do you think I 'm lying ? But Marko , please . They were all the colors of the world . And suddenly ... mine kariola flew off into the sky . Like a bird ? Yeah , you said it well . Just like a bird . But without wings . Yeah , yeah , no wings . It 's easy makes fun , on my account . And I 'm telling you it 's truth . And It 's up to you if you believe it , or not . It 's up to you . Look , Shime . You have it easy , you get per one kilo of fish more than I earn in whole day . I 'm working like a mule . And you , and you Tome ... one barrel , two million , and clone . Yeah , yeah , laugh in my face , assholes . Why will you care about my kariola , when you have your asses full of money . See what you 've done ? Dad , take . You can film it . But , not eat it - . Enjoy your meal , Marko . What nice day , we have today , huh ? So now Marko , finally tell us , for how many liters of wine You sold off your kariola . Come on , Marko . We 're not strangers . So you 're saying Marko , from this place , that it soared into the sky ? I wonder if you know , when I start to believe ? When hell freezes over . Or , when these crates will fly up to the sky . Mr. Shime , leave my dad alone . Leave him alone . Let 's look at the cockerel , how he 's enraged . Get out , little twit . Get lost ! Shime ! Stop hurting the kid . No , don 't turn it on ! Why not ? He need a lesson . Turn it on . Turned on . Tome ! My God ! What is it ? My crates . Did you see that ? And they say that your father was drunk . We can 't blame ourselves . We punished offender . And we revenged Adam . We have nothing to regret . In the end . There are justified wars . But don 't you think we a bit overdid it ? Yes . You overdid it . And yours also flew up ? Here , comrade Marko , he will tell it . So it flew up ? It flew up ... Like ... Right . Photos . Marko . What is going on here ? How do I know ? I 'm worried . Don 't be angry at me for those jokes . What I told you . How this will end . Some unknown , unexplained force is lifting objects Into the air some weighing over one hundred kilograms and which are immediately fired into space . First it happened with a cart of local carrier Marko Pivac . And second day unknown force fired into the stratosphere several crates full of fish . We have a film footage , acquired by a random pedestrian . German tourist Karl Holz . Judge for yourself . And now look at the report made by our editor Franjo Juric from the place of the event . We are on the Hvar pier close to the circle marking boundary of the site , from which recently flew kariola of local carrier , Marko Pivac . That started story of unexplained mysteries . Comrade Marko . Could you clarify to our television viewers How did this happen ? What do I know ? I already have a full head of it , everyone is asking what happened ... How it happened , so ... I was like every day , on my workplace . Here in the harbor . On the duty and suddenly something whistle , something creaking , roar it lifts cart , and take my poor kariola to the sky . Straight to the sky . It served me for twenty-five years . And since that day , it still has not come back . I don 't have it . Why ? And how it was gone . I don 't know , I really don 't know . And you comrade Shime , How can you explain that power ' ? How I can explain that power ? Well I can say . It 's all the same . That great powers making vast hell from the world , do you understand ? They are shooting all sorts of projectiles , rockets , one big filthiness , and that 's why all firing is bad for all of us . Do you understand me , my friend ? We know that on the other side , they have big problems . A lot of people who are starving . Even starving to death . That is unfortunately true . - There you are . What more I can say . Mr. editor , You know that better yourselves . Thank you comrade Marko , and you too comrade Shime . Dear television viewers , My today 's reportage ends . Thank you for your attention . We will be further monitoring the whole situation . Greetings from the sunny island of Hvar . Goodbye . It 's in all the papers ! Here you go . Read this . Here . Newspapers from almost all over the world only write about us . About that our miracle . Folks it is for us like ordered . Luckily , summer is ending . Now would be needed to deploy good propaganda . And the whole world will be hurtling on Hvar . Mato is right . Now we have a unique chance . I just think that it is necessary take advantage of it . Several of us should scatter in Europe and , of course , in America . Americans love such mysteries . They like big things . - Slowly , Tonci slowly . There is a need to act in the spirit of stabilization . Stabilization can wait . We , as you all know . We have a strong television . Good reporters , and plenty of our citizens abroad . And it should be fully exploited . But ... I will return back ... to the situation here . We all know that on Saturday , 28 . It will be in our city great celebration . I recommend . Use this opportunity to give to our Marko Pivac new kariola . Were it not for Marco and his kariola , This never would have happened . Remember it comrades . Don 't forget that , please . Keep going , Holm . I 'm expecting you . For God sake , Holm . Forget it . You are not in the army anymore . Sit down . I invited You , Holm not only because you are excelling in cybernetic and electronics . But also because you are one of our most skilled and reliable people . Are you referring to events on that Yugoslavian island . Exactly . Between us . There is very little of informations . Practically nothing . And that 's something . Sharp-witted as always . Our experts are sure in one thing that events on Yugoslavian island . They are not a product of nature , but it is the product human skill . Your task is You will get to this product first and at any cost , you will brought it to our country . Is that clear ? When ? Now . Good luck , Holm . Nothing again . What can you do . We 'll eat the bait . Even bait is sometimes good . I will soon return to Prague . But I wish I could have stayed here . I 'll write . And I 'll answer . And then I 'll answer to you , right ? Bojena is not normal . Instead of letting Pepik enjoy himself with us . She is filling his head with some female crap . What you can do . You are such city kids , you can 't enjoy life . Between us , folks , I have to admit , I 'm afraid . I 'm afraid , even though I walked around almost half of the world . I even have read a lot of newspapers and various sorts of literature . And I 'm a person who was in the fight on the right side . And who went all-out in the life . Do you understand me ? And as such , I 'm worried today . Due to these unfortunate events of the last days . What 's happening today . That was never seen before . I can 't work normally . I closed cooperage . It 's a question of my existence .

My God , you 're an idiot . I 'm worried , like every reasonable person . What I told you .

Theirs transparent provincial sensation . Nessie from Hvar . Mister . - What , kid . It is not a scam - . My father 's kariola really flew into space . My father doesn 't lie . And crates I saw myself . Look colleagues at that little trickster . After my father will come , sir , we will see who 's a crook . Get lost , you little brat .

Well , two . Two ? Miro . I know what you want . But we promised to Bojena , that we will not use the cannon again . But we said , too , they are justified wars . The picture will be named : " Windhausen again on Hvar " . Give me back my barrel , Mr. editor . Come on , take it yourself . If you can . But watch out , you don 't want to fly away . Miro . There is man on the barrel . Set weaker voltage . And , it is not a man , but asshole And I 'm aiming at the barrel . For all the saints , Stop that ! You know what happened to Shime .

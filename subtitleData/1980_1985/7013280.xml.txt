Honey , we 've been through this a hundred times before . I know it 's hard on you , but it 's a matter of principle . Now , what right have they to just throw us out of what 's been our home for 28 years and tell us we gotta move to New Mexico ? Who the hell wants to live in New Mexico ? - Let 's go ! - Jesus ! No , no , I 'm stayin ' right here ! Now , if you wanna go , you go ! Oh , Joe , you know I wouldn 't go without you , but maybe New Mexico isn 't too bad . I mean , we 've never been there , so do we know ? They 're not throwing me out , God damn it ! They 're not throwing me out of my own house ! Please , Joe , do it for me . Well , don 't you see ? We can 't give in to those bastards . We were born here , for Christ 's sake ! Joe , I understand , I really do . I just don 't think it 's worth the pain or worth the misery , the living in fear . God , Joe ! Ah ! - Here come the bastards . - What are we gonna do ? - This is what I 'm gonna do ! - No , it 'll make it worse ! - I 'll show ' em ! - No ! No , Joe , no !

Come on , try it , you sons of bitches . - Cut it out . - Hmm ? Now break this up . I 'll twist his balls off and shove them down his throat . Yeah , sure . Come on . And one , two , three , hut ! One , two , three , hut ! One , two , three , hut ! One , two , three , hut ! Hey , quit laughing at me ! Keep popping , baby - Say it , Trash . Still alive , huh ? Listen , honey , I am still waiting . - Say what ? - Go on , just let me see it . - Sure , okay . - And I 'll slice it like salami . Ooh-hoo ! Wait a minute . I hear you . I don 't mind you , either , but I gotta be going . All right , all right , Trash , let me see what you 've got . Come on . Ammo . You ask for ammo , I bring you ammo . Okay . Why are you getting so excited ? Stay cool . Man , I 'll tell you something . I really think you are pretty damn good , coming and going all the time . Well , well , isn 't that nice ? Flattery and compliments . It 's nice to know you 're appreciated , even though it 's bullshit . Oh , by the way , next time the price of ammunition is going up . Hey , don 't you think you 're ripping us off enough ? Vamos ! You get what you deserve , the Bronx gangs and shit , holed up down here , eating out of tin cans . Well , we are alive and kicking , my friend . Whereas up there , they kill us like ants . - One , two , three . - Hey . - One , two , three . - Hut . - One , two , three . - Hey .

It 's all bark and no bite . Here , I brought you this . Here , just in case you run out of toilet paper . Jesus . Those bastards ! Those motherfuckers ! They still try . Huh ! " Get out of the Bronx , " they say . " We 've got the solar houses in enchanting New Mexico waiting for you . " Hijo de puta ! While you 're laughing , they 're wasting innocent people . You know what the problem with you guys is , Dablone ? You ran too quick without even trying to make a stand . Well , the ones with guts didn 't scare so easy . Oh , sure . Look who 's talking . Superman ! Well , what about my old man and my old lady and others like them ? Just try and move them out of the Bronx . Nah , you turned chicken too soon , that 's all . If you had any brains , you would tell them to come here , underground . The disinfesters will never come here . Nobody with balls is gonna either , Dablone . New positive readings , sector H-8 . Hah ! Y ah ' ! Ugh ! This , ladies and gentlemen , will be the New York of the future . The most magnificent architectural complex ever created by man . The Eighth Wonder of the World . This work of genius , ladies and gentlemen , was conceived and promoted by our president , Mr. Clark , who has committed all the company 's resources to the project . Thank you very much . Thank you . Thank you , thank you . As you can all see , it 's a suspended city linked to the other inhabited zones . A perfect , ordered , civilized metropolis . A future city for future man serviced by the most modern technology available . A city in which there are no social blights . Areas of poverty , illiteracy and crime , like the Bronx , will have been totally eliminated . It 's about time . The Bronx is a public disgrace . Right on . It should go . - The crime rate 's horrendous . - The Bronx is a plague . It 's not to be believed . The people from those areas are guaranteed accommodation and a higher standard of living in New Mexico . That just isn 't true ! Why the hell don 't you admit you 're deporting and killing them , that you 're causing accidents and epidemics to eliminate those people who put up the slightest resistance to being thrown out of their rightful homes ? - Get her out of here . - All right , let 's go . Get your dirty hands off me , you fascist pig ! Damn it , I 'm a journalist ! This is supposed to be a democracy ! You others , don 't believe a word they 're saying ! - It 's lies . - Get her out . This isn 't a press conference , it 's a farce ! An unadulterated , filthy , dirty farce ! You hear me ? And the GC Corporation sucks ! Ladies and gentlemen , we live in a democracy . It 's only right that we answer the questions asked by bona fide professional journalists and not the hysterical outbursts of so-called crusaders . Continue , Mr. Hoffman . Any questions ? The Bronx has been in quarantine for two months . When will the press and television be allowed in ? The epidemic isn 't under control yet and that isn 't the worst danger we want to avoid exposing you to . Uh , Mr. Hoffman , exactly what danger do you mean ? Well , the Bronx has become a kind of no-man 's-land controlled by street gangs . As for the transfer of the , let 's say , honest residents , what truth is there in the rumor they 're being forced out ? It 's total nonsense . They have been financially compensated and relocated with their full consent . Uh , what evidence is there for this , sir ? We have a great deal of photographic documentation showing their current splendid residential areas in New Mexico . Plus , affidavits from the thousands who 've gone there . Now , all this will be made public as soon as the operation is completed . Attention , attention . - Abandon all buildings . - Come on ! This is a final warning . Abandon all buildings . They 're about to be demolished . Abandon all buildings . They are about to be demolished . Go on , move your ass ! Attention , this is your final warning . Abandon all buildings . They are about to be demolished . They are about to be demolished . Attention , abandon all buildings . What 's the word from headquarters , sir ? Fuck headquarters . I 'm doing this my way . There he is . - Mr. Clark ! - Excuse me . I just have one question , Mr. Clark . What did you tell the international press ? Nothing you don 't already know . - That 's bullshit . - I told you . See you later . Look , however much good we do , there are always those who 'll find some reason or other to knock it . When will the demolition ceremony take place ? Thursday afternoon . How are you answering the UN Human Rights Commission ? It 's all in the dossier we gave to you . - I can 't ... - Mr. Clark , what about that issue ... It doesn 't say anything . The national press has the right to be in on anything that concerns the welfare of U.S. citizens . No , I assure you all information is in the dossier . You didn 't put these into the dossier , did you , though ? You didn 't dare include the identity of who you put in charge of the Bronx evacuation . Floyd Wrangler . And we all know who Floyd Wrangler is , don 't we ? A torturer , an expelled prison warden , a killer . All right , that 's enough . Break it up , make way . Make way . Yeah , here 's your man . Floyd Wrangler , hired killer . Evacuate all buildings at once . This is our final warning . Demolition squads are about to go into action . I repeat , evacuate all buildings at once . Demolition squads are about to go into action . Demolition squads are about to go into action . This is your final warning . I repeat , this is your final warning . Jackson , load those charges . Cumin ' up , comm ' up . Come on , you guys . - Give me a hand here , will ya ? - There 's still somebody inside , sir . What did you say was inside ? Well , sir , I said there 's still somebod ... Oh , right , uh , rats , roaches . Right . - Proceed ! - Jesus . Come on , move your butts ! Take over that building now . Run ! All right , come on , you guys . Let 's move it , huh ? That building , dynamite it ! Who 's got the wire ? - You , move that truck . - Comm ' fight up . Mr. Wrangler , sir , a call from Mr. Clark for you . Fine . I 'll take it now . All squads move back under cover . Demolition is about to start . All squads move back . Listen , Wrangler , I 've got the media on my back from morning to night , and I don 't know what to tell them anymore . I 'm paying you damn good money , and look at the results I get . In five days , the Bronx operation is coming up at the UN . You know what they 're calling your methods ? Genocide . The technical term is " disinfestation . " Now , you pay me to take care of the technical side . The moral part is ... is not my sector . The important thing is to ... to do the job cleanly , Mr. Wrangler . In 1986 , despite all our technical know-how , we did not succeed in getting rid of the rats . Now , these people , if you can call them that , they are a , uh ... a race apart . They 're what 's left of the gangs that battle for the Bronx . You 're worse than they are , Mr. Wrangler . Allow me to correct you , Mr. Clark . I 'm worse than anybody . There 's a bunch over there . They decided to leave . Well , we 'll have to def lea ' em and billet them in the transit depot . - What do you wanna do , burn them ? - Yeah . Let 's go . Come on , wake up ! Understood , Skyboy-5 . To all disinfestation squads , to all disinfestation squads , emergency alert . Converge on sector R-2-R . Repeat , R-2-R . A gang led by Trash has ambushed one of our squads and wiped it out . I repeat , in sector R-2-R , a gang led by Trash has ambushed one of our squads and destroyed it . Over and out . Who does this bastard think he is , defying us ? Terror is our strength and he isn 't even afraid of us . The gangs must not be allowed to find a leader . We 've got to find this Trash and kill him now . Oh , shit . Sorry , Moon . I was sure we were going the right way . Will ya cool it , Jay ? I was born in the Bronx . Ready ? We 're right under LaGuardia Square . Judging from the stink , I 'd say we 're under the public toilets . Mm . Listen , get back there . Are you ... are you sure of this , Moon ? - We have to risk it , Jay . - What the hell for ? You think four lousy pictures of their dirty work 's gonna change things ? So far , talking 's done no good . Come on . Take cover ! We 're being attacked ! Take cover ! GM to central , ambush in sector C-9 . If they see us , we 've had it . Ugh ! Ugh ! Hold up , hold up . Let me untie you . Get away , get away . I 'm rigged with a bomb . Get away . Go on , will you ? For God 's sake , run , brother . - Jeez , there 's a bomb ! - Get outta here ! Get away ! They rigged him with a bomb ! Run for cover , quick . Quick , Jay , there . There 's others coming . Ugh ! Freeze ! I thought you said she was taken care of . So you let them both get away , the girl and that delinquent Trash person . Hah , I don 't think so . They 're both under there ... or maybe there , but somewhere there . Maybe you intend to go down to convince them to waste themselves with some dynamite . Oh , I don 't think so . I 'm gonna get rid of them first . That is , before the truth comes out . Nobody knows they 're there . It 's easy to make people who don 't officially exist disappear . Can you ? Yes . Only we 've got to catch them by surprise . If we let them get away , it 's gonna be very tough . The place is full of tunnels , passageways , sewers . It 's like a ... it 's like a jungle . It 's really a wonderful place . Who are you ? Moon Grey . Oh , yeah , the reporter girl . I hear about that on the radio . You know , you 're really something . You sure caused a stink . I was born here in the Bronx . That 's why I get so worked up about it . Shh ! Things are looking bad . If you don 't do something down here to protect yourselves , you 'll be in trouble . Did you hear that , boys ? We are in trouble . You think it 's funny ? Well , she 's right , you shit . Hey , cut the crap . What about you ? And your plans to stay out in the open ? You think you can stop them , huh ? Listen , thief of Baghdad . You really think you guys are safe down here ? Baby , they will never come down here . They know very well we 'll bust their asses if they do . Dablone . Part the waves . Part the waves , come on . What is it , honey ? I found this in the tunnel under the old schoolhouse . This disinfester was poking his nose around . I plugged him . I did right , didn 't I ? Yeah , yeah . What 's eating those guys ? This is the first time they come here . They never dared before . They want to rebuild the Bronx . You think they 'd go ahead with you jerks down here ? Listen to her , Dablone . She 's got a point . Right . Nobody would sit on a john full of dynamite . Skyboy-5 , I repeat the message . Check for hidden entrance under slaughterhouse , hidden entrance under slaughterhouse . Corner 23-A and 51-A . Repeat , corner 23-A and 51-A . Also , under the stadium locker rooms , north side , same sector . Will someone give me a hand with these goddamn crates ? Just relax , will ya ? - Excuse me , excuse me . - Get moving with that shit . And then let them come . We 'll be ready . Moana , what are you doing here ? Go back outside and keep your eyes open , understand ? Right . Okay , boys , 10 minutes . Hurry up . Hey , Chuck , put those out by the entrance , all right ? You 're not gonna settle anything with shooting and killing . I 've tried to make Trash here realize that , too . What are we supposed to do ? Tell them , " Come in , make yourself at home , " huh ? No . To lick them , you gotta force the GC Corporation to negotiate and ... Eh . - Hey , put those guns over to one side . - Ali Baba , there 's only one way . That 's what I 'm doing . Kidnap their president . - Kidnap the president ? - Mm-hmm . Me gusta . I like it ! But , uh , how can anybody cross New York without being caught ? It 's very risky . They 'll all be against us ... them , the police , and maybe the National Guard . You 're talking about up above . What if somebody crawled all the way underneath the city ? There 're people who 've done it , aren 't there ? The robbery of the First National Bank . Then there was the time they cleaned out Tiffany 's . They had that crazy Strike as a guide . Right . Isn 't he around anymore ? Oh , he 's around , all right , but he will change his hole for a villa on Long Island . - Is he hard to find ? - No . But the hard thing is to find him in a good mood . Why ? What if he 's in a bad mood ? Then you 've got a problem , a big problem . Yes . Yes , of course , Al . There 's nothing in the papers this morning . Okay , Al . I 'll go there myself and see what I can do . Don 't mention it , Al . It 's my pleasure . Okay . Bye , Al . What a mess . He wants the hospital finished before the elections . Well , at least we have his promise that he 'll see Washington doesn 't interfere in our Bronx business . Yeah . But this damn hospital is costing us all of $ 80 million . I don 't know who 's worse , the politicians or the gangs . Listen , I like your style , but go easy with that thing , huh ? - I gotta see Strike . - Go back home , fag . I gotta see Strike ! Gotta my ass . Only if he 'll say okay . Watch out for the wire . Boom ! Boom ! Strike ? You certainly must 've heard I 'm crazy , right ? Sure did . Heard you 're the craziest , but you 're also the greatest . We need you to kidnap the president . - Of the United States ? - No , the GC Corporation . The pricks wanna kick us out of the Bronx . Pfft . Sure , I heard . You really think I didn 't know ? They 're especially out to get you . And rightly so . How else could they have succeeded with the robbery of the century without you ? You mean the National Bank job ? And what about Tiffany 's ? And how about the time we emptied Rockefeller Museum ? Oof . Hey , wait a minute . Wait a minute . - What 's in it for me ? - That 's simple . If they want their president back , they have to put things back the way they were . The Bronx will be back in the hands of the gangs , which means you 'll go back to being the number one guide for all the big robberies instead of hiding out down here scratching your balls . Huh , I like scratching my balls . But you got a point there . Okay , you can count on me . Get ready , Junior . We 're going on a job . What do you plan to do with the kid ? Ah , I wouldn 't think of doing a job without him . And it 's okay by me , honey , if you really want to bring this , uh ... this useless slob along . Don 't try it again . I 'm a pro . You sure had me fooled . Junior . Now , listen . It 's gonna get much rougher from here on in , so be on your guard . There are more ways to die down here than there are in a Bruce Lee film . Each one 's on his own . If anybody gets hurt or has to stay behind for any reason , tough shit . Don 't count on help . Pow ! Who is the boy ? Believe it or not , he 's my son . And you keep him buried down here ? Why ? Is up there better ? Moon , let 's leave your bag over there . Junior , place your charges about 10 feet apart . We 're going out now . I 've explained everything . - You know what to do . - Yeah , okay . Good luck . South access blockade active at 10 : 24 . Over . - I 'm not so sure about this setup . - What do you mean ? I got 46 men covering every nook and cranny . All right . I 'll check back with you later . Hey , are they gonna bring that lunch wagon over here or are we gonna have to go over there ? They 're supposed to bring it over here . I hope they held it on time . Shit . They blocked all the roads leading to the island . How do we get in ? We 're in already . Come on . I 'm gonna go across town to this great bar I know . English pub . They got great scotch and lots of broads . Hey , what is this , a hen party ? Shape up . Come on , you 're not on vacation . Follow me . We got a job to do . Hey , they just called . The lunch wagon 's on its way . Hey , all right ! Yay ! They better have some ham and cheese on that wagon . - Oh , yeah , sounds yummy . - Huh ? Ladies and gentlemen , here we are on East Island with a beautiful view of the Manhattan skyline where the official ceremony for the commencement of the demolition of the old , historic Gothic castle is about to begin . In its place will be the new children 's hospital . The helicopter has just landed and Mr. Henry G. Clark is getting off . Ready to greet him is New York State Governor Malcolm Biddle . Hello , Mr. Clark . How was your trip ? - Very good , thank you . - Ah , please come with me . We have some photographers waiting here . They 're gonna be snapping some pictures . We want New Yorkers to know who the man is who 's building their future city for them . I guess a little notoriety never hurt anyone . There may be some questions as well , if you don 't mind . - No , no , not at all . - As you have read in the papers , Mr. Clark , president and main stockholder of General Construction Corporation , has not only donated the entire island to the state , but generously agreed to do the complete razing job free of charge . - Delta-1 , Delta-1 . - Yeah ? - Radio links established . - Okay . Right . - Situation ? - Everything here is under control . Understood . This is a message to unit leaders , message to unit leaders , until the ceremony is over , all rivercraft including ferries are to be kept clear of the island . Now report your situations . Sigma-2 . Over . - Area one is covered . - Roger , Sigma-2 . - Omega-6 , come in , please . - Omega-6 . Squad 's in place . Nothing to report . - Roger . Able-3 ? - Able-3 here . All units are in place and everything is well under control , sir . Checked area four . We 'll move on to area five . And on behalf of the General Construction Corporation , I have the great honor of asking Governor Biddle to give the first blow of the pick . Thank you very much , Mr. Clark . I 'm very proud . Ah , that 's the way , Governor Biddle ! The governor has just given the first symbolic blow of the pick to the wall of the old building , marking the beginning of the demolition . The new children 's hospital to be constructed by Mr. Clark 's company will be styled to blend in with the " Eighth Wonder " project for the future ... the complete rebuilding of the Bronx into a fashionable residential area . ... the sanitation network that was one of our campaign promises . And by God , we 're gonna carry it out . I 'd like to ask Mr. Clark a question . Hold on ! I believe Mr. Clark has only time for one or two questions . Uh-oh . I think we need a little diversion . I 'll take care of it , Conan . How ? - I know what to do . - Go to it . The Bronx project is part and parcel of our effort - to provide the remodernization ... - Guys , they 're all lies ! It 's about time the truth was told . Why don 't you ask Clark what 's really going on in the Bronx ? - That nosey crusader again . - Well , I 'll tell ya . I can tell you because I 've seen it with my own eyes . People are being slaughtered in there , exterminated , and this genocide is being condoned by our dear governor . Why don 't you admit it , Governor Biddle ? Why don 't you admit that you 're in cahoots with Clark , that you 're giving GCC carte blanche - to ensure your reelection . - Can 't you stop her ? - It 's an obscene , corrupt plan . - She 's got a gun . - She 's gonna shoot Mr. Clark . - Killers , murderers and criminals ! Oh , my God ! Protect Mr. Clark ! Get him out of here ! Did you get this ! Are you getting this ? - Oh , man , am I ever . - No gun , nothing . - All right , motherfucker , move it . - She didn 't have a gun . You 're blind , buddy . I saw it myself . Get that camera outta here or I 'll ram it up your ass . No ! What ? Will do . Let 's move it ! - Clark 's been kidnapped . - Shit . This way ! Shit ! Stay where you are . - Look how he runs . - He 's a fag . Ugh ! Ah . Good afternoon , Mr. Murdering Clark . Come on , let 's get outta here . Stay down ! To all emergency units operating around the Bronx , President Clark has been kidnapped . Repeat , GCC President Clark has been kidnapped . Come on . Go on , go on . Always me , huh ? Okay . Skyboy-9 to central , I may have something . Over . Go on ! What do you want from me ? - Who are you ? - Shut up ! Squad number two to the sewer system north of the port . Squad nine to the subway tunnel in sector four , the 125th Street entrance . Come on , move it ! Move it ! Always last , aren 't you ? Deader than a doornail . The ones who went after them are all dead , too . Hello . Wrangler here . Shift seventh squad to the Bronx and give me an okay . You people never learn . You 've got to hit them first . - Yes , I know , but they 're ... - Hello ? Okay . Intercept them before they reach the Bronx . And don 't go the same way they did . The place is rigged with explosives . I 'm on my way to the Bronx to direct operations myself . Squad four to emergency exit 1-1-7 . Repeat , 1-1-7 . Squad eight to emergency exit 3-2-6 . Repeat , 3-2-6 . Beware of possible dynamite charges . Wait over there . Hold it ! Listen , whatever happens , I 'd like to get something ... something straight between us . If it 's his head , no way . You don 't really think that I and I alone am responsible for all the ... the unpleasant things that have been going on in the Bronx , do you ? It 's very complicated . You understand . The decisions were not all mine . Yeah , but you 're still a wheel , the king shit . And a son of a bitch . So boo ! - So ? - Okay . Haha ! Let 's go ! Come on ! Let 's move it ! Jesus Christ ! Get back ! Get back ! - Get back ! - Ah ! Come on ! Strike ! The bastard got away ! Don 't shoot ! It 's me , Clark ! Don 't shoot ! Am I glad to see you guys . Get back ! You try that again and you 'll look like a tea strainer . A hostage is no good dead . I 've gotta be worth something if they 're going through all that much fuss topside . Then you know who to root for , right , Mr. fucking Clark ? 'Cause if we make it , so do you . They 're coming ! They 're coming ! Where are they ? - Right now they 're in tunnel four . - Charger set ? - Yeah . - Okay , let 's go ! Come on ! Move ! Come on , will ya ? Send a squad down the manhole . Eight didn 't get through . Why waste any more squads ? Because we 're leading them into a trap . They cannot get out of the Queens sewers or the Manhattan lines either . Fine . I 'll be in my office waiting for news , good or bad . Hello . Yes . Wrangler . What are those idiots doing , sleeping ? Listen . I want a squad sent to the East End sewer now , God damn it ! Wrangler , we 're ready to go down now . Hurry it up . What 's the delay ? Go down quickly ! There , against the wall ! You guys 'll never make it . Look , if you let me go , I promise I 'll talk ... Shut your damn trap ! We know your fuckin ' promises . Now ! Down there ! Go , go ! Come on , big shot bastard . Let 's go . Hold it . Go on ! Hold it . We 're right on top of them . The fourth squad is blocking the main exit , so we 've got them trapped . It 's only a matter of minutes now . That was a stroke of genius , sir . Don 't congratulate me too quickly . These bastards are a race apart ... goddamn hard to kill . Good boy . It 's easy . Go ahead , that way . Let 's go ! Move ! Pow ! Quick ! Yeah . Let 's go . I repeat , if we intercept them , we 've got them . But if they get under the Bronx with all those gangs , I cannot guarantee it . - You say Mr. Clark is in danger ? - Absolutely . There 's a risk that they will kill him . I will talk with you later . Ah . No sugar , you idiot ! How many times do I have to tell you ? No sugar ! It makes me crazy ! Miss Gibbs , take down a press communique . Our president , Mr. Clark , has been kidnapped by a group of Bronx criminals . Their demands are absurd and unacceptable ... $ 10 million or they 'll kill him in cold blood . These are not people fighting for their homes , but crooks hungering after money and blood , especially blood , because the time they give us to collect this enormous sum is ridiculous , which they know perfectly well . They 're right on top of us , that tunnel there . Okay , go on . Wait there . Okay . Go on ! Fourth squad went off on the wrong track , sir . They fell into some kind of trap , but the fifth squad has them cornered near the main sewer junction . This is the end of the line . If we let them get away from us this time , there will not be a second chance . Of course , the president . It was his life that I was talking about . Double-check those buildings on the right . Four men with me . Come on . Hey , they made it . Here they come with that prick Clark . - That goddamn son of a bitch ! - Get him ! All right , that 's enough ! What do you think you 're doing ? Get away ! You crazy , huh ? Cabrones ! Stand back ! I 'm warning you . You 'll answer for this before a court of law . Sure , sure . Well , guys , you did it . Nice going , Trash . Congratulations . And now , let me see what a president looks like . Oh , shit ! He got two arms , two legs . He 's just like us . So here the motherfucker finally is . I 'd like to kill him . Sure , I 'd like to cut his throat , but if I do , we can 't negotiate . And now , those bastards up there , they will listen to us ... if they want their president back . Dablone ! Dablone ! The disinfesters , they 're outside , preparing an all-out attack . - Keep those stations . - Yes , sir . Block all exits and shoot to kill . Oh , Mr. Hoffman , you 're just in time for the grand finale . How long does the gas take to work ? Oh , about a quarter of an hour . First , paralysis sets in , and then death . It 's a pity we have to sacrifice Mr. Clark . I 'm not so sure about this . Well , it 's up to you , Mr. Hoffman , but the president of a corporation cannot afford to be emotional . Then go ahead . And , uh , thank you very much for your help in making this terrible decision . But I get paid for that , too . We could never justify this as a corporation , but now that public opinion has turned against the kidnappers and murderers , it 's the only way . Mr. Clark was already dead anyway , but this gives us an alibi to justify ... a reprisal . What the hell is that ? - Gas ! Gas ! - What ? Everybody get outta here ! They 're gassing us ! Jesus Christ , get out ! Get out ! They 're gassing us ! Get outta here ! Don 't panic ! Don 't panic ! - It 's gas ! - Moana , this way ! Trash ! Trash , over here . Come on , come on ! Come on ! Ah , shit ! Ah ! Go . Now ! - Where are you going ? - Down Ryan Street . Hey , look out ! This way ! Come on . Now . Come on . Cover us ! Ah ! Wrangler , where are you ? It 's me , Clark ! Wrangler , it 's me , Clark ! Zebra-1 to Wrangler . I just see Mr. Clark , sir . - Where ? - Right here . He just came out of E-6 exit . I 'll take care of it personally . How ? Don 't worry . Our way . Mr. Wrangler . All I can say is I 'm very , very happy to see you . Me , too , sir . Bastard ! Bastard ! Bastard ! Well , that 's taken care of . Soon the rest will be over , too . See you later , Mr. Wrangler . See you , Mr. President . Over there . - You all right , hero ? - All right , Big Little Man . - Thanks . - Good luck . Damn ! Ah ! Pa . Let 's go back down . I don 't like it here at the top . Trash . Come with us . Pow !

Why did this happen to me ? How did I fall for a guy whose first love is a machine ? Look , honey , you don 't understand . What I developed with Cal , it- - it 's what gives me an edge . God , every time I think about that experiment that you were involved in and how you were able to link up . Hey . He can 't link up the way we can . Marry ? That is a big step , Mr. Bradford . And if I 'm going to be Mrs. Bradford , I want to know exactly how I stand in relationship to it . - Oh , not so loud . - Oh , my God . - See what I mean ? - I 'm just kidding . Look , I- - I 'm not in love with my computer , I am in love with you . I am . You 're a good cook . - Oh , yeah ? - Mm-hmm . Actually , Cal found this great recipe in this metropolitan art museum magazine . Mmm . That 's nice of her . Hey , I forgot dessert . Oh , Paul , I don 't want dessert . No , you 're going to love this . Okay . Da-da . Oh . Hmm ? So , you like it ? Paul . I love you . This thing with Cal is more than I can live with . You 're consumed with a passion . I would just be your wife . So , what 's wrong with that ? Nothing , except I want more . I want to be a part of your life . You will . You are . Come here . Come on . - What ? - Sit down . Cal , check your data on marriage to men with careers by women with intelligence , beauty , and hard heads . Stop it . I 'm not some stupid little kid . I have just as much brain power as you do . Probable outcome , success . Let 's go to bed . At least that 's one place I know I 'll have all of your attention . Gwen ? Gwen ! Gwen . Gwen ? Gwen . Gwen ? Gwen . - Paul ! - Gwen ? Gwen . Paul , help me . Look , let 's just- - Let 's piece this together , okay ? - Uh- - - Paul , these are real chains . All right , now , well , we were asleep ... and , uh ... and I had this dream . I don 't believe this . You ... are a worthy opponent for Mestema . Now you have all power centered on you . You may call on your machines . Your magic machines . Anytime , anywhere in your world .

It 's- - It 's man 's ability to- - to take science in order to- - For a thousand years , I have scoured the Earth and the ages . Here and there , I found a minor challenge . But now ... there is you . You and your machines . The new magic . Now , here is how it will be . I , Mestema ... have devised seven challenges . Lose one ... just one ... and I shall have both your souls . Paul , what if this thing is real and we can 't get out of here ? Hey , look , uh ... Look , I 'm Paul Bradford from Xyrex . Paul ? Are you there , Paul ? Gwen . Gwen , I 'm over here . Where ? I can 't see you . Just stay put . I 'll find you . But it 's cold . Paul , where are we ? It looks like Mestema 's private art gallery . Oh , my God , that 's Einstein . Oh , there 's Bloody Mary . What a weird combo . It looks like Louis XVI . Isn 't he the one who invented the guillotine ? No . But he lost his head to one . Oh , Paul , I don 't like this place . It gives me the creeps . Yeah . It looks like every criminal in the world is here . Paul ? M-My hands are freezing . I can 't feel a thing . Just hang in there , Gwen . I think I see you . Paul ? My legs are frozen . I can 't move my feet . Just- - Just keep cool . - Cool . - But- - But Paul , I 'm freezing all over .

I am Ratspit , caretaker of the dead . - Dead ? - Yes . I control these discarded husks that once contained the human soul . Why am I here ? To test you against that Death . Well done . I commend your abilities . So , uh ... I met your challenge . Can I get out of here now ? Gaze upon it . It is your own death at the hands of Mestema . What 's this ? You give up so easily ? Not at all . It comes for you . You 're wrong , Spitrat . Ratspit . How- - How is it that you can destroy that , which is your own destiny ? That creature was not my destiny . Mestema has perceived it . That thing was only a culmination of future possibilities . In a future reality . I shall destroy you . I reject your reality and I substitute my own . You are a bold adversary . Oh , my God , Paul . Gwen , are you okay ? No , I 'm not okay . I 'm having a very bad dream and you just happen to be in it . Lovely creature . Keep her out of it , Mestema . Keep her out of it . Paul , don 't push your luck . Do you fancy music ? This is a piece of my own composing . You like this noise ? You should have your fill of it .

Your own little whims and fancies . You 're an egotistical , overbearing- - That is no way to penetrate this barrier . It is the strength of a million souls . The power of the dead . Oh , Paul . You have spirit , woman . Why waste your tender youth ? Your supple body ? He is a mere child . Not from where I 'm standing . It looks like you got more than you bargained for . How ... quaint .

Three for one , my best offer . Yours , for as long as you can tolerate the ecstasy . Paul ? Good try , Mestema . Yeah , damn good try . You 're a fool ! I don 't think so .

Officer You 're somethin ' . I ask for any kind of plain donut , you give me a jelly donut . Yo , where 'd he go ? How 'd he get out of here ? Julie Waters , age 23 , actress .

Probable location vacant lot , 654 South Swall Dr. 7 / 10ths of a mile . Abandoned auditorium location , 2133 Lexington . Vacant lot . Auditorium . - Dancing . - The distance is 1 .1 miles .

Five seconds to challenge termination . - Hey , did you see what I saw ? - Nope . Me neither . Paul , I don 't think I can go through this anymore . We 'll make it . Look , when this is all over , what if he doesn 't let us go ? Trust me . Paul , I think we 're missing something . This whole contest thing , there 's more in it for him or else he would 've just zapped us . What is that word , " zapped ? " It 's a magic word , Mestema . If I were to zap you . Hear me , Baal-baelum . Hear me , incubus Astaroth . Abbadon , Mammon . If I so wished , it would destroy you . Great . Paul ? No . No way , Mestema . - You can forget it . - Paul ? I 'm gonna regret this . Warning , thermonuclear activity . Paul ! Gwen ? So , this is the challenge , huh ? Do I even need the computer for this ? I suppose this is my idea , right ? Scan reflection , program rendered . A totally unstable condition exists . The chances of hitting the target with a controlled strike are zero . You didn 't listen . You would 've won by simply walking out of the cave . I didn 't know . I had no idea . I , too , transgressed , and was banished to this cave . I 'm sorry . Lf there 's something ... Anything I can do ... You 've done it . Yeah . I remember when I was a lad . We found a cat . It was scavenging in an alley . We covered it in cold tar . Except for the face and the eyes . And then we lit the tail . What a sight . I shall never forget it . A howling torch , streaking across a field . It turned and spun in a series of wild gyrations and leaps . And finally ... into a twitching mass . Its insides burst forth in wet sputters . Its eyes bulged to the size and the brilliance of agates . Animals can be such fun . Ahimsa . Where did you hear that word ? Ahimsa . Respect for every living being . For every creature that can feel . What conceit , what hypocrisy . You mortals think you are so full of heart and soul and love and kindness . You think your god looks down on you with tenderness and mercy ? You 're mistaken , my friend . It is humanity , not the devil , that is red in tooth and claw . It is your god that rains down terror on you . You have no heart and no soul , Mestema . And that 's why you 're bored . That 's why your immortality is Hell . Prepare for the end . Alone at last . Yeah , like the last people on Earth . Well , at least you 're not chained to the rock . Nice outfit . Yeah , another Mestema original . Where are we ? Cal ? Scan communication frequencies . See if you can find out where we are . - Scanning . - Hey , don 't leave me . Scan shows inhabitants hostile .

Why , you little creep . Yee-haw ! All right , Mestema , enough is enough . Hey , what are you doing ? Good shot , huh ? Whoo . What is it ? We 're out of control . Cal , what 's going on ? Remote control . Well , jam the signal . Override the remote . Remote control is not conventional . Mestema . Sensors show second vehicle . - Trajectory ... - Paul . ... Identical to yours . Opposite direction . Mestema ! The game is over . You call this a contest , Mestema ? I do all the fighting while you sit around like some fat overlord waiting to see how I fare .

Another thousand years of boredom ? Mestema , I know what you want . But you 're not going to get it sitting on the sidelines watching some worthy opponent have all the fun . Only mortals who risk losing can know real excitement . I , the Excalibrate , challenge you to a real contest . You have some trick up your sleeve , eh ? One man against one man . In this arena . No magic . No tricks . Paul , he 's a giant . You can 't possibly win . It is a trick , I know it 's a trick . Trust me . What are the conditions ? What are the rules ? No rules , except that we go free . Get up ! Yes . Get him ! No ! Cal ! - You okay ? - Yeah . Oh , God . Oh , we 're home . - Yeah . - We won . Hello , Paul . I 'm back . I 'm not so sure . Yes . - Yes ? - Let 's get married . Let 's get what ? Well , I talked it over with Cal and it all adds up . Paul , is that you ? Paul ? Mestema !

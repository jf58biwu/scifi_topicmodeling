 Good evening , ladies and gentlemen . From the channel 5 newsroom . At the top of the news this evening is speculation concerning the real facts behind the department of health announcement about a radioactive spill supposed to have occurred yesterday at the state nuclear plant . Information from an official source , which reached our newsroom this afternoon , stresses the seriousness of the situation . But at the same time , provides a certain amount of reassurance , concerning already contained any damage caused by the accident . Hello , Miller . Mr.Desmond 's waiting for you Go right in . The arrival here , expected at any moment , of professor Otto Hagelberg . One of the original planners of the nuclear station , will undoubtedly enable us to obtain more precise information . You heard ? He 's arriving tomorrow morning at eleven . Take one of the best camera men with you . Why me in particular ? Because I want an exhaustive interview , which will reassure all our viewers . Not just the truth , pure and simple ? Forget the philosophy , Miller . Just do what you are told . If possible , Sir .

Glipswick tower to Beach Craft , please stand by . It 's a Hercules military transport . That 's strange. lt doesn 't have any markings on it . It looks like he 's going to land . He 's coming in on 16 . Make sure that the runway is clear and Pete , would you declare an emergency please ? Attention ground crew ! Emergency landing runway 16 Repeat . Emergency landing . Runway 16 . Hey you . Up there ! Who are you ? Where 's the pilot ? Harry here . Nobody inside answers . What the hell 's going on ? I don 't know . What do you think ? Let 's see . What 's the story ? Nobody answers , Sir . You inside ! Open the door and come out with your hands in the air ! This is Commander Davidson of the Airport Security Police . You are surrounded in the name of the law . I order you to come out . You have just thirty seconds to make up your minds . Watch it ! The door 's opening ! It 's Professor Hagenbeck . I don 't believe it . My god ! Let 's get out of here Go ... Interrupt the program . We 're transmitting a special newsflash . Does the chief know about it ? There 's no time to tell him . Am I in charge of the broadcast or not ? Whatever you say , Massa .. Your wish is my command . Wake up Terry . Drop your powder puff girl and announce Miller and a special news flash . Ladies and Gentlemen . Your attention please . We are interrupting our transmission of " lt 's All Music " for a special news flash . At the end of the newsflash we 'll return with our regular program . Thank you . Oh shit ! Just when I was gonna do my first close up . Oh , shut up , will you ? I want to listen to it . At 1 1 o 'clock this morning , an event without precedent took place at the airport of this city . An airplane of no nationality landed on the south runway of the airport . Ignoring all instructions from the control tower . The airport police immediately converged in the scene of the unauthorized landing , surrounding the aircraft and ordering ... Yes sir. I told him that . Right away chief . .. the order had absolutely no effect . What the hell are you doing ? Why did you interrupt my broadcast ? Now don 't get mad at me . It 's not my fault . The chief rang down . Albert . What the hell is going on here ? They 're UFO 's . It 's bound to happen sooner or later . You 've read too many comic books . You can say what you want but I 'm not going home alone tonight . You can sleep at my house , I 'll protect you . Yeah , who 's gonna protect me from him ? Will you all shut up ! We 're back on the air in 20 seconds , come on . is it possible that you 're not aware of the trouble that broadcast could have stirred up ? Or the uproar that would have followed it ? I 'm well aware of that General Merchenson . But I 'm a journalist and my job is to keep the public informed . Mr. Miller listen to me very carefully Something very serious has happened at the airport . But until we conclude our investigation , and take the necessary counter measures , nothing is going to leak out . Nothing . The defense department has strictly forbidden it . I don 't give a damn about the defense department . In a democratic country nobody is allowed to interfere with the freedom of the press , for any reason whatsoever . I see . Mr. Desmond . As the person in charge of this station , you will be held directly responsible for the dissemination of any tendentious news . I 'm sure you realize what you 're risking . Don 't worry . We won 't transmit anything without your authorization . Thank you . Good morning . I 'm fed up with you Miller . I 'm suspending you from all duties . No you 're not. I quit ! Okay . I 'll take care of it first thing . Excuse me honey . Sorry . Hello ? Hello , Liz ? is my wife there ? She just went out . Just this minute . Call her back immediately ! Yes . Yes sir . Of course . Mrs. Miller ! I am sorry , sir . But I missed her . But you 'll be able to reach her at the hospital in half an hour . She said she wasn 't feeling well today . She was going to stay home . I don 't know . Maybe she changed her mind . Okay Liz . Okay . Please don 't answer . It 'll stop . This is your day off . Yes . Agent Warren Holmes ? Speaking . This is civil defense headquarters General Merchenson would like you to come down here right away . Why ? What 's up ? The general will explain everything to you himself . Come right over . The drill is maximum urgency . I 'm sorry my love . We 'll finish our conversation later . What 's wrong ? Don 't you like it ? No , on the contrary . Every time I look at it I get a feeling of ... Of death ? is that what you were going to say ? It 's funny . It 's the first time one of your works have given me a feeling like that . It 's the truth . I 'm sorry . I can 't say that you are wrong . When I look at it , objectively ... I mean when I 'm not actually working on it . I almost get the feeling that I wasn 't the one who made it . But some other being outside of me . It frightens me . That sounds like science fiction . Metaphysics if you want . It 's better if we don 't take it too seriously . I 'll junk it if you like . No . Don 't even think of it . Can you imagine what the world would have lost if Michelangelo destroyed his works at the request of Major Warren Holmes ? But I 'm not Michelangelo . To me my love , you 're much more . Wake up Major . If not you 're never going to get to work . Camera one . Move out from her waist and hold on it . On two . Hit it ! Holy shit ! What the hell is going on down there ? Civil defense ? This is Channel 5 TV station . We 're being attacked ! For God 's sakes ! Send somebody fast ! Get out of here ! Hi Louise . Well how are you felling today Phil ? Horrible . I feel like somebody the hatchet guy is waiting for to chop off his head . Well , that sounds like an improvement over yesterday . Temperature ? Normal doctor . Continue with antibiotics every eight hours . Well. lf it isn 't my favorite patient . Hi , Jim . How are you feeling today ? I feel a lot better , but I can 't play soccer yet . You 've got a couple more weeks and that 's it . Before you know it you 're going to be running up and down that soccer field making one goal after another really . Dr. Kramer is the best there is . is that the truth ? The truth . Last night I had this nightmare . It was all about my leg . There was this big explosion , it was right here in the hospital . My leg got cut off . Well we don 't have to worry over that any more . Your legs gonna be just fine The truth . Well okay . I 'll stop by and see you later . Our latest report shows the presence of attackers here , here , and here . This enables us to determiine a presumed line of march from the airport to the city limits . Their quite definitely in a north eastern direction . We don 't know if this indicates a pre-determined plan , but we must react as though it did . We have no other choice . Unfortunately , the reports coming in from our various information centers , the latest from the National Science Academy , are all rather sketchy . But they do suggest , even in a vague way , the type of counter measure to adopt . You may proceed . This is the body of one of the attackers . It was picked up on the runway at the airport . The autopsy categorically excludes an extraterrestrial being . His molecular structure clearly establish him as a member of the human race . A paradox when you consider what they 've been doing . Colonel , please . I am Colonel Donahue from the institute of atomic research . The examination of various tissue samples that we have taken from the body , reveal the presence of a high degree of radioactivity far superior to the level normally tolerated by the human organism . In addition , we have found more or less recent hyper tissue regeneration . Can you make that a little simpler , Colonel . Some of your colleagues may not have the same theoretical or technical background . In other words , this individual and others like him , have been subjected to strong doses of atomic radiation which increases their physical capacities beyond the norm . How far beyond the norm ? That 's difficult to say . But it 's a fact that these cells subjected to every treatment we know have turned out to be almost indestructible . In short it 's a kind of a superman . Much more than that . What do you mean ? I mean that at the abnormal strengthening of the cells vital quality has increased their direct genetic capacity . In other words , Major , the victims of these creatures are contaminated , even if they only suffer minor injuries . Then they can reproduce themselves , say indefinitely That more or less , Major , is correct . And you say with our weapons that they cannot be destroyed . No . That their substance can 't . Excuse me Colonel . Isn 't that the same thing ? Not exactly . A machine may be indestructible , yet its functioning may still be blocked . By interrupting the feeding process for example , atomic contamination destroys the efficiency of red blood cells in very short order . That is why new blood is always needed . For these creatures tthe human organism i greatly strengthen . However , the power still remains in the brain . A lesion to the nerve center can produce paralysis . The procedure stops the complex entirely . You mean that only bullets damaging the cranium can stop these monsters ? This corpse is the proof . It 's the only lifeless body we have recovered . The cranial apparatus has been destroyed . Thank you , Colonel . Lieutenant Reedman , you 've heard everything . The order to every soldier and police officer is aim for the brain . We must be very specific about that . As for our combat plan , we 'll follow emergency plan H and keep plan B in reserve in case the situation gets out of hand . That 's all for the moment gentlemen . Thank you . Oh Warren ? I have to talk to you . Excuse me General . May I make a phone call ? Alright but hurry it up . Yes sir . Thank you sir . I 'm trying to reach him now , sir . Yes sir . Hold on please . Hello . Sheila ? Oh , it 's you Warren . I was in the bathroom doing my hair . I want to look nice for you this evening . I 'm afraid that this evening is out of the question . Can you tell me why Warren ? I can 't explain it now . I was looking forward to ... My darling listen I want you to do exactly as I tell you . Understand ? Perfectly . I will do what you wish and not ask why a typical male chauvinist pig attitude . Sheila this is serious . Don 't kid around . I want you to make sure all doors and windows are locked . Nobody is to be let in ! Nobody , understand ? I 'll be home as soon as I can . And when I get there you make damn sure it 's me . Clear ? Yeah . Transparent . Have you become insanely jealous all of a sudden ? Think whatever you want to think . But for God 's sake , Sheila . Do what I tell you ... Okay City Poly Clinic . May I help you ? Wiill you hold the line please Dr. Miller is wanted on the phone . It 's for you Dr. Miller . It 's your husband . Tell him I 'm very busy . He can call again later . I 'm sorry sir . But Dr. Miller is about to go into the operating room . Please would you call back again later ? I must speak with her now ! It 's urgent ! Can 't you just ... I 'm sorry sir , but I can 't disturb her now . I see . Thank you . Jessica , what are you doing ? We 're supposed to be leaving for the weekend . I know. I know . is the camper all packed ? All packed and filled up with gas . Now who could that be ? Oh well . Okay. I 'll get it . No.Leave it . Don 't answer it . It 's probably some bore . Or maybe your father who always wants to know , where we 're going and if we have enough money . Oh , didn 't you know ? Generals are fussy and General Merchenson is no exception . I really don 't know why I married Jessica Merchenson . It isn 't even three months and already you repent ? I 'm a pacifist . You know I hate uniforms . Good morning madam . Your father wishes you to join him immediately at headquarters . He does ? At headquarters ? Why ? I have no idea . He tried to phone you but there wasn 't any answer . He says that you 're not to waste any time . I have a car outside . Why ? Did something serious happen ? Your father will explain everything to you . Maybe some kind of war broke out . Okay . You can wait for us in the car . Headquarters 79 . Hello . May I talk to General Merchenson ? It 's his daughter speaking . Yes ma 'am . Will you hold the line please ? I 'll try to locate him . The line was cut off . Listen. it 's dead . Why don 't we just clear out of here I don 't like spending my weekend with a General . It 's probably not important . I could call him from a telephone booth . Come on . Hurry up . We have to sneak out , so that idiot outside doesn 't realize anything . Okay ? Let 's go . Give me your hand . Dr. Miller , please . I 'm her husband . Oh , I 'm sorry . Dr. Miller is in the operating room . She 's assisting Dr.Kramer in a very delicate operation and we have strict order not to disturb her . But I must see her . I can 't wait . Sorry Mr. Miller , orders are orders . Dr. Schreiber , Dr. Schreiber , Please . We have an emergency in the outpatient department . Dr. Schreiber . What the devil 's going on today ? You know , that 's the sixth emergency in two hours . Alright . Alright . I 'll be right down . Hold your socks on . Raise it up . It 's Whitey , let him in . Come on . Come on Whitey , why are you standing there ? Hey , what 's happening here ? Unfortunately they 've just sabotaged the south power station as well . We have a team of engineers there , but this will take hours before they can get working again . With luck . Well , the lines are still down . There 's orders to bring your daughter and son in law back here to headquarters . General Merchenson . Gentlemen . The government insists that we not dramatize the situation or leak any news that might cause public disorder . We can 't conceal this from the public . Why ... It 's absurd . The government disagrees We 'll just have to try to keep control of public buildings , barracks , hospitals as long as we can . After which . we 'll be completely on our own . You 're right Warren . We 'll simply have to declare a state of emergency ourselves . Dr. Peterson ! They 're coming in like flies . Come on . We need all the help we can get . Hold that light up a little higher miss . Thank you . What the devil are they up to those fools ? Why haven 't they turned on the emergency generators ? Two of the generators are out of order Doctor . They are starting up the third lt 'll provide just enough current for us and the emergency ward . Have you checked the pulse rate , Anna ? Yes , Doctor . Weak but regular . Very well . Continue with the direct oxygen . Keep the light steady . Ah , it 's about time . It 's running low Doctor ! What ? Yes . Anna would you please take care of that and hurry . Yes Doctor . Help ... help ... Somebody help us There you are . Oh my god. I can 't breath . I think I 'm going to faint . Why doesn 't somebody do something ? Hey out there ! Open up this door will you come on Help ... somebody help ... Oh please god . Help me ! Help ... help Anna ... Anna Where are you ? It 's me Anna . Don 't be afraid . Oh my god it 's you . Take it easy . Take it easy . Oh Dean . There 's something . It 's terrible. lt 's horrible You can 't imagine Yes , I know . Anna . Come . Have they gone crazy ? Jason do something . Make them keep quiet . Keep still . Don 't move . Let 's try to reach the stairs . Now ... Get us out of here ... My heart feels like it 's bursting . Why don 't they hear us ? Somebody help us ... Please ... somebody Let 's not panic . If we keep calm then we can all breath a lot easier . The shaft has a lot of air . Why doesn 't somebody do something ? These things have manual controls on them . Why don 't they wind us down ? You 're right ... Hey , wind us down ! Hey somebody ... Wind us down ... Help Somebody help me please ... lt 's alright . Be calm . We 're falling . We 're falling Get back . We 're gonna be alright now ! Oh my god . Quick , the ambulance Behind you ... Lookout ... Hey George . How about taking us down a little . Okay . Air force 7 to base 2 . Air force 7 to base 2 . We 're at coordinate B. So far we 've had no trace of invaders on this side . It 's only an ambulance heading out of town . I 'll continue on re-con . Any news of your family ? No . None . I only hope they 're alright . I 'm sorry Merchenson . I really am . Thank you Well , the situation is hopeless . Many parts of the country are cut off . Most telephone lines are out . What 's worse , we 've lost contact with government headquarters . We 'll have to declare a state of emergency ourselves . But you realize ... I 'm fully aware of the consequences . I just see no alternative . I understand . What are you orders ? Please notify bases 1 12 and 401 to stand by with helicopters and if necessary , squadrons of fighter bombers . We 've got to get control back at once . Before it is too late . Or before we have all become contaminated just like them . " ... has declared a state of martial law . All civilians have been ordered to remain in their houses or to place themselves under direct protection of the police or the military . Private traffic may circulate but only if authorized ... " It 's frightening . How could a thing like this happen ? It 's part of the vital cycle of the human race . Create and obliterate until we destroy Words ! We 're up against a race of monsters . Created by other monsters who have only one thing on their mind , the discovery of greater power . At least this time there won 't be any historical justification . Even if any of us survive . Do you think it 's possible to stop them ? The infection is like an oil stain and who knows how far the contagion has spread now . " With the grave danger of contamination all public buildings and private enterprises will remain closed for an indefinite time . Weekend vacationers are ordered to report immediately to the nearest police station or military installation . The civil defense authorities have declared a state of emergency . They have further stated ... " Jessica . Stop that humming , will you ? It makes me nervous . What 's wrong ? What on earth is the matter ? I just heard a news flash on the radio . Something serious has happened in town . They 've declared a state of emergency . A state of emergency ? Are they crazy ? No. I don 't know . It 's difficult to understand , but we should go back to town . But we just arrived . I have no intention of giving up my weekend . To hell with the soldiers ! Listen , you 're my wife and I love you and I don 't want anything to happen to you . So it 's better we go away from here . Something doesn 't feel very right . Like what ? Like that continuous barking , but I haven 't seen a dog around and we haven 't seen a car since we got here . In a place like this . Look at the road Jessica . Usually there 's heavy traffic . It 's all very strange . Listen , it 's almost 10 , but John should arrive soon . Let 's talk with him . They should know what 's happened in town . Okay . Bob ... My god . It 's horrible . What do you think happened ? There they are ! Martha , Martha ... Oh , are we glad you are here . You can 't imagine what 's been going on . First Bob heard this news flash and ... Say . What 's going on ? You two ... Hey ! What are you doing with that gun ? Sheila ... Sheila ... Open the door Please Sheila ... Sheila , it 's me Cindy let me in please ! Sheila , can you hear me ? For god 's sake , Sheila ! Open the door ! Sheila . Thank heavens I found you . I just couldn 't stand it any more , being in the house all alone . Come into the front room . Johnny went off to work and the cleaning lady never showed up . I kept hearing noises everywhere . On the roof . In the cellar . Everywhere . Well , you can relax We 're safe here . At least for the moment . Warren is coming as soon as he can . My god , Sheila ! What 's going on ? I don 't know . I really don 't know . Have you tried calling Gracie ? Her husband is with the department of ... something or other . How can I call ? The phone hasn 't been working for three hours . Are you sure ? It 's not working here either . There must be a breakdown at the exchange . Cheer up . Drink this . I 'm frightened Sheila . Really frightened . On the radio they said to stay home and lock all the doors and windows . I did it . I even barricaded the crawl hole to the cellar . What did you say ? That I barricaded the crawl hole to the cellar . How did I manage to forget that ? Wait Sheila ! Don 't leave me alone ! I 'll come with you ! Thanks for reminding me . Be quiet . Light a candle and stay down here Sheila ... Sheila Sheila ... They weren 't even curious . We have a red cross protecting us . What is it dear ? Damn . We 're running out of gas . There . Anybody here ? Anna ? You can get out . There 's nobody here . Looks like they left a while ago . What do you think about this ? It 's not really you . But it 's better than that . Just like a western . Except that they didn 't have instant coffee in the good old days . Another advantage of civilization my dear . Like Coca-cola or nuclear energy . We 'd be a whole lot healthier without all that stuff . This is good . Do you think we should give up the advantages that we have gained ? Maybe it would be better . However it is not the fault of science and technology , but of man . Nature 's own human element . We haven 't reached the age of the robot yet . This mess could have been avoided . Yes , but for how long ? I don 't know . But one thing is clear , we 're partly to blame ourselves . Just think of the life we have led up until Shut up in those ridiculous cities in a steel and concrete jungle , like machines . All this had to happen to realize the truth . Let 's hope it isn 't too late . " ... have special commando units positioned at all strategic points in and around the city , according to the latest reports from the civil defense headquarters .

So much for the theory of vampires . Captain ! What 's going on around here ? I 've been on the radio for the last half hour . Why hasn 't someone responded ? We located other infected areas north of here along sector 29 . So get those planes in the air ! Well ? Don 't just stand there ! Answer me ! Or are you looking for a court martial ? Don 't move major or I 'll kill you . I 'm not going to die like the others . You can 't fool me Major You 're like all the rest . Contaminated . Bringing death and destruction , but no more . I don 't intend to die I want to live . Put that gun You 're crazy You 're calling me crazy ... ? You 're calling me crazy ? I 'm not crazy ... Air force 7 to Base 2 . Air force 7 to Base 2 .

I will pass you over General Merchenson . Here you are Sir . Warren . This is Merchenson Listen carefully . All communications with operational command units have been cut off . Do you hear me ? C and B is out . Return to base ! Do you hear me ? Your mission is useless now . This is received General . Will do . Over and out . Oh , Donahue . I suppose you 're here to tell me your experiment didn 't work out . Huh ? On the contrary , the gas has proven effective . Our planes can fire it with their missile launchers . You can begin at once General . But Donahue we have no planes not anymore And there 's no more Reedman . But didn 't he leave from the airbase at Chatters ? He never got there . They brought him here twenty minutes ago . God help us all . Wait here.l ' m taking another passenger . Sheila ? Sheila ? Sheila . Why did you leave the door open ? I told you to ... No ! No !

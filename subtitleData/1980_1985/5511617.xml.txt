 Martin , take us home . Donovan , look ! It 's Diana 's fighter . She 's getting away . Don 't shoot ! Breathtaking ! For those of you joining us late ... the pictures on your screen are coming to us live via satellite ... where it is already night on this , the first anniversary of Liberation Day . The day the Visitors were driven from Earth , never to return . Meanwhile , here in Los Angeles where it 's early afternoon ... I am at the Club Creole ... where Elias Taylor , one of the Resistance heroes ... is hosting this Liberation Day celebration ... in his new and already successful cabaret . You make it sound as if the restaurant business is my whole life . I 'm also a technical advisor on the new film , Lizard Kill . How could I forget that ? The same way you forgot to mention my new line of footwear : Spacebusters , the footgear for Galactic Heroes . - Is there anything else ? - No . I would like to say to any of my old buddies out there : If you ever need a helping hand , you know where to come . And I 'm sure they will . But now let 's go live directly to the captured Mother Ship ... for a look at what scientific progress has been made since Liberation . Take it away , Dirk Small . Thank you , Debbie . I 'm standing here with Nathan Bates ... head of Science Frontiers , and former Resistance leaders ... Dr. Julie Parrish and KDHB newsman Mike Donovan . Mr. Bates , Science Frontiers was the mass producer ... of Red Dust bacteria for the Resistance ... a task you performed during the Visitor occupation . What convinced you to take such an enormous risk ? Dr. Parrish . She can be extremely persuasive . That 's why I put her in charge of the Mother Ship project ... from the moment the government awarded us the contract . The Visitors were an advanced culture . I have every confidence Dr. Parrish will succeed in unlocking their mysteries . We have a very special working relationship . She really worries me . Robin . I love her , but she seems so distant . She 's still learning about human emotions . Give her a little time . But she 's different . Everything is different now . I know . But the worst is behind us . Why don 't you take a couple of days and go on to Santa Cruz ... like you planned ? - Are you sure you can manage ? - Of course I can . She 'll be fine . That is Elizabeth . Yes , the Star-child . Half human , half Visitor . She 's almost directly below us now . We 're moving in . We 're going to attempt to land , and then we 'll be speaking with Elizabeth . Why can 't they leave us alone ? Something is happening . It 's as if we 're being pushed . Literally pushed away from the ground . Do something . Nice going , you 're the best assistant I 've ever had . Bet you , in a couple of weeks , they make you a cameraman yourself . Does that mean you 're reconsidering your position at the anchor desk ? No , that 's showbiz . I 'm a newsman . Mike , wait . - I 'll see you outside . - I 'll catch up with you . - Is everything all right ? - Sure , fine . Why ? You seemed a little on edge during the interview . Maybe I don 't enjoy the same special relationship around Bates that you do . This whole investigation with the Mother Ship has been stalled . Diana had a security code that we just can 't seem to break . There 's so much we need to learn about . Like the conversion process , for one thing . - You heard from Sean , huh ? - No , I did not hear from Sean . I heard from the state school in Ojai . And you feel guilty about having sent him there . He needs my help . He 'll resist rehabilitation . I know him . I 'm going up there this weekend if I have to bust into the place . Sorry , I forgot . Saturday . - I 'll make it up to you . - That 's what you said last time . - That was last time . - What are you doing ? It 's Liberation Day , remember ? You 're about to be liberated . That is Elizabeth . Yes , the Star-child . Half human , half Visitor . She 's almost directly below us now . We 're moving in closer . We 're going to attempt to land , and then we 'll be speaking with Elizabeth . Something is happening . It 's as if we 're being pushed . Literally pushed away from the ground . Do something . And that 's the way it was this afternoon ... when we attempted a live interview with the Star-child . We 'll have more on this later . Now let 's go to Keith Chavez ... and a report on the upcoming trial of Diana . Not since the Nuremberg trials of World War II ... has there been this kind of international ... Mr. Tyler is here , Mr. Bates . Send him in . I thought you 'd be celebrating Liberation Day . I ended celebrating a year ago . And got right to work building a very fine security agency . I work . No , thank you . Always to the point , eh , Mr. Tyler ? Just like your covert operations in Central America . - That 's ancient history . - Not to mention Angola , Middle East . - Shall I go on ? - What do you want ? How would you like to work for me ? Doing what ? Doing what you do , Mr. Tyler . - Providing security for the highest bidder . - Meaning you ? Meaning Science Frontiers . You know about our company . You manufacture Red Dust , you 're studying the alien technology . It is my hope that from this terrifying invasion ... mankind will reap some benefits . While you reap the profits . Tell me , Mr. Tyler ... what would you do with Diana ? I 'd use her for target practice . Then you reject the argument that she can atone for her crimes ... by helping us in our fight against disease ? Diana is the disease . Yes , but if we take her life in vengeance ... we 'll be condemning millions of people to death ... because we won 't have the knowledge she can give us . Remember , the Visitors offered us a cure for cancer . You 're wasting my time , Bates . On the contrary , Mr. Tyler . I 'm offering you the opportunity of a lifetime . $ 500,000 . You gonna be okay covering Diana 's trial ? Sure . But I still think a trial is a waste of money . This is a democratic society , Martin . Everyone here is innocent until they 're proven guilty . You have to understand that on my planet , justice is swift and final . Diana would get what 's coming to her . - She 's gonna get a fair trial . - She deserves death . Pill time ? Every twelve hours for the rest of my life . What a racket , huh ? Nathan Bates manufactures the Red Dust ... and then turns around and markets the antidote . With Nathan Bates , everything has a price . - Is that all you 've got left ? - It 's all right . Just remind me to get a refill later . Or you 're gonna be looking for a new assistant . - I 'll call you as soon as I get to Santa Cruz . - Have a good time , all right ? I will . Don 't worry about Elizabeth . She 's gonna be fine . I know . Grandpa . Mommy 's going away for a couple of days . Grandpa 's going to take care of you . - Will you come back soon , Mommy ? - Of course , baby . I 'll miss you , Elizabeth . You be a good little girl . I 'll miss you , Mommy . Ready or not , here she comes . Get back . Come on , let 's get her out . Back , buddy , back . Come on , we 're gonna follow her . The chopper . Come on . What do you think you 'll get for stealing a helicopter ? Two years , or a Pulitzer Prize . Where 's that ambulance ? There it is . - That truck . - Where ? That one . Did you see it enter the underpass ? No . Then it has got to have been there waiting all along . - Mike , I don 't understand . - They could have pulled a switch . I 'll bet a month 's pay that ambulance with Diana is in the back of that truck . There she comes . Diana looks confident . Confident she 'll be acquitted of crimes against humanity . There 's even a hint of a smile on her face . There ! When she raises her arm , you can see the bullet hit just below her heart . You can see the panic caused by the attempt on Diana ' s life . We 're still waiting to hear as to the seriousness of the wound . If that injury had been sustained by a human ... a bullet so close to the heart ... the victim would be near death ... Grandpa , my arm hurts . It 's okay , honey . Grandpa 's gonna make it better . Here , sit down . Science Frontiers ? I need to speak to Dr. Julie Parrish . All right , take her inside . Hi , sweetheart . I 'll take a look at your arm , okay ? Robert , would you get me some ice , please ? Sure . Good evening , Diana . - Who are you ? - Nathan Bates , head of Science Frontiers . I 've been responsible for dismantling and the analysis of the Mother Ship . It 's a losing proposition so far . Which is why I arranged your assassination . With a tranquilizer dart . Too bad . I was rather looking forward to my day in court . I doubt that , Diana . You were guilty of crimes against humanity , genocide ... and , yes , cannibalism . That 's a matter of taste . What do you want ? As far as the rest of the world is concerned , you 're already dead . I could kill you right now , and no one would ever know the difference . - But you have something else in mind . - I will keep you alive . I will provide ... suitable accommodations , appropriate food ... non-human , of course . And in return ? In return , you will share your secrets with us . We 'll start with a vaccine against cancer ... then we 'll develop some pest-resistant crops ... a pollution-free fuel , some recombinant DNA . I see . I cure the ills of the world ... and you get the credit . - That 's the deal . - Or I turn you into a pair of shoes . Still crude , Mr. Tyler ? My options seem limited . - Very . - As well as my space . If you cooperate , I 'll let you live outside , under guard , of course . How ? One of my companies controls the Red Dust and the antidote . That is how the Visitors like Martin and Willie can exist outside . You can , too , Diana . Interesting . I 'll think about it . Don 't think about it too long . I 'll be back . - What about the assassin ? - He 's already out of the country . Look , Bates , remember our little bargain . When there 's no more she can give you , she 's mine . I hear a car pulling away . Can 't see it . All right , careful . We 're gonna need proof if she 's still alive . If she 's still alive , then she must be killed . First we get the proof , then we tip the law . Come on . Yeah , she 's there all right . All wrapped up in somebody 's pocket . Give me the camera . I 'm sorry , Mike . Drop it ! What are you doing ? You 're letting in the Red Dust . Suffocation takes too long , Diana . I 'm gonna do the job right . - Martin , listen to me ... - You 're a destroyer , Diana ... an evil . A sickness . Everything you touch dies . You don 't bargain with a pestilence , you wipe it out . You have something I want . Mike , Diana 's gone . She escaped . It 's my fault , Mike . It 's my fault . No , Martin . It wasn 't your fault . Oh , no . You 've got to stop her . She 's gonna signal them . She 'll bring back the fleet . There 's not much time left . She can 't survive on Earth . The Red Dust in the air will kill her . She 's finished , Martin . - The antidote . - She took my last pill . She 's got 12 hours . You 've got to do this for me . I will , Martin . What ? Tell me . - She 's sleeping . Fitfully , but she 's asleep . - Good . I just fed the horses . It must have gotten really cold last night . How 's she doing ? Robert , she 's not retaining fluids . Her fever is still high . I just can 't break it . What do you mean you can 't break it ? She 's been burning up for over an hour . Her body can 't sustain itself at that level . Her system is probably just fighting some infection . Come on , Julie , you saw the arm . That is not an infection . She 's a hybrid . I don 't know what to do . We 've got to do something to help her before it 's too late . You 're afraid she 's gonna die , well , so am I. Then there must something we 've overlooked . There is . Maybe you 're right . Maybe she 's not fighting an infection . Maybe she 's turning into one of them . - She 's taken her horse . - Let 's go . You got a problem , little lady ? Can I give you a lift ? That 's very kind of you . Well , the pleasure 's all mine . Hey , your skin is cold as ice . I know . I get these terrible chills . Maybe I could warm you up . Funny , I was thinking the same thing . I 'm gonna take you some place that 's out of this world . - I said Diana 's on the loose . - Calm down , Tyler , she can 't get away . The captured Mother Ship is too heavily guarded . She 'd never risk it . I 'm not talking about the Mother Ship . Southwestern Tracking Station is not far from where she escaped . It 's a fully automated facility able to receive and transmit signals ... over billions of miles of deep space . She 'll call for help from there . That makes sense . Take three men . - No amateurs . I do this my way . - You work for me . Wrong . I 'm a free agent from now on . Then I 'd say I 'm entitled to a refund . I 'd tell you what to do with your money , but that would be rude . How will I know if you 've killed Diana ? I 'll let you live . That man who just left . He 's a problem . No , Mr. Bates . He 's history . - Why are we stopping ? - The golden rule . I do something for you , you do something for me . I see . That 's nice , that 's real nice . If she left her horse , she can 't be far . Robert , there 's light coming from that cave . Robert , look out . That 's Elizabeth . She 's in there . The snakes , the cave must be full of them . We 've got to reach her . No ! It can 't be . Robert , she 's going through a metabolic change . My God , into what ? Wait a minute , no . Can 't interfere right now . Whatever this process is she 's going through , we 've to let it run its course ... or she could be damaged . Maybe even die . You 're improving . What the hell are you doing here ? That was my line . I think you know what I 'm doing here . Diana . - Diana 's dead . - Not unless you killed her . You already know all about this . - Never mind what I know . - Who are you working for now ? - CIA , FBI ? - Listen . - Do you hear that ? - That 's a homing signal . Martin was right . She 's trying to reach them . Yeah , it 's coming from over here . Check out the computer . This is it . Mr. Donovan and Mr. Tyler . How nice of you to see me off . You don 't have much time . Martin only had one pill left . I 'm going after her . Circle around outside . Fire a shot if you spot her . One shot 's all I 'll need . We 've come full circle , haven 't we ? Drop your weapon . Goodbye , Mr. Donovan . This is for Martin . I had her . Dead . Next time . It 's already next time . Your transmission was interrupted or we would have been here sooner . What a primitive planet . We were afraid you might be dead by now . The Red Dust . I don 't know why , but it didn 't affect me or you . Our Mother Ships and our skyfighters . How many are left in the Earth system ? Enough .

 Yes . No ! Hey , George ! Not a bad day huh ? - Better than most . - Going to voluntary therapy ? - Yeh , I 'm gonna see an Oneirologist . - A what eirologist ? Lemme see ? What 'll they think of next huh ? Excuse me , do you know where Willamette East Tower is ? Dr. Haber . First floor , second elevator , please . Hold it ! - Hello ! - Yes ? I have an appointment with Dr. Haber . - Name , please . - George Orr . Dr. Haber 's expecting you . It 's the last office on the right . You can hang your rain gear over there . Thank you . Doctor , it 's thee overdose . Yes ? - Dr. Haber ? - Ah ! Mr. Orr . It 's a pleasure to meet you . Come in . Won 't you have a seat ? Do you smoke ? The brown filters are tranks , the white are denicks . Oh , no , thank you . I don 't smoke . Good . It 's stuffy enough in here already . Damn electric heating system is on the fritz again , I 'm afraid . Well , that 's OK ! Don 't be nervous , Mr. Orr . Your punishment is no worse than a few sessions with me . That 's better . Do you have your VT card ? Oh . Yes a ... So , mixing Phenobarbital and Dexedrine ? Quite a dangerous concoction , woudn 't you say ? Mr. Orr ? You have a dream problem , don 't you ? - How did you know ? - No great feat , I 'm an oneirologist , Mr. Orr , a dream specialist . They always send the dreamers to me . - Well , all I want is to stop dreaming . - May I call you George ? Yeah , I guess ... - Call me Bill , if you like . - Oh , well that 's OK ! However you feel comfortable . Dr. Haber , what are we supposed to do here ? We 're going to work together . We 're going to build a relationship . You 're gonna let me inside , poke around find out what 's causing those bad dreams of yours . I assume that 's what the problem is , bad dreams . Sort of . Why don 't you tell me about them ? You 'd think I was insane . I make no judgments , George . I 'm here to help you and that 's all . Give it a try . Suppose I dream , that there 's no Dr. Haber . Now , tomorrow , when I wake up , not only are you gone , but you never existed . Pretty revealing , wouldn 't you say ? - Oh well , no , I didn 't mean that ! personally . - Perfectly OK . You can tell me to go to hell , if you like . It 's a part of building our trust . - I didn 't mean that . - I 'd like you to lie down now , George . What ? It 's all right , go on . It 's all right , George , just relax . Lie back . Now , I want you to take deep breaths and close your eyes . Patient George Orr . Age 32 , voluntary therapeutic treatment , drug abuse . Reasonably good health , slightly undernourished , passive , repressed , maybe an intelligent schizophrenic . You relaxed now ? - Yes . - Good . Now , I 'd like you to tell me more about these dreams that change reality . Think back to the first one . How old were you ? 17 . I was 17 . I was still living at home and ... Aunt Ethel , my mother 's sister was living with us , she was getting a divorce . She 'd been there about six weeks . And she was always in the way , she drove everybody crazy . She kept making a joking play for me . She was 30 , kind of sexy , she got me up tight . And she was always trying to turn me on . And one night while we were watching television , something happened . How can I have done it ! She was my aunt , for God 's sake ! I used to have these dreams about her . And that night I had a really vivid dream . And then , when I woke up in the morning , Aunt Ethel wasn 't living with us , she never had lived with us . A telegram had come from Los Angeles , my Mother was crying . Aunt Ethel had been killed in car crash . And that was it . It was my first effective dream . And nobody else noticed that Aunt Ethel had suddenly vanished ? My dreams change everything that comes before them . And nobody knows it but me . I killed her . George , I want you to understand something ; There is a difference between what you dream and what you do . But not for me ! It 's the same thing . And I can 't control what I ... What you can control is all of this guilt and anxiety . That 's exactly what we 'll be working on together in the next few sessions . - Dr. Haber , you gotta help me . - George , if I thought you 're about to lose your balance , I wouldn 't let you out of here so quickly , believe me . What I will do is give you a prescription for Meprobamate . That will keep your dreams low-keyed without repressing the dream state entirely . But it 's only temporary . I expect to see you back here , the same time next week . I didn 't mean to kill her . Mr. Orr . - Infraction of Federal regulations controlling dispensation of medications at auto-drugstores . It says here , you 've begun voluntary treatment with a Dr. William Haber , correct ? Yes . You 've surrendered your a ... pharmacy card to authorities ? Yes . Only I have a prescription from Dr. Haber . Here it is . All right , I 'll have to issue you a temporary pharmacy card . But don 't abuse it . As is your right , if you have any complaints here 's an HEW approved list of public investigators . Any other complaints ? - Just with my dreams . - Not my jurisdiction . Next ! - You gonna use that on me ? - Correct ! Now in laymens terms ... This is what happens . First , I 'm going to hypnotize you and put you to sleep . Now you 'll go through several stages of sleep , the final one being the dream state or REM sleep . And the Augmentor here will pass you quickly through those first stages and lock you into REM sleep . And that will allow me to hold you there while I watch your brain at work . - My brain ? - Mhmm . Then I 'll suggest a dream to you . In your case , an effective dream . Oh , that 's dangerous ! Oh ! the Augmentor changes nothing , George . Miss Crouch , could you bring Mr. Orr the Consent to Hypnosis form , please . Thank you ! Do you trust me , George ? OK . Good , now I 'd like you to lie back and get comfortable . Now , is this comfortable ? Looking at a nice healthy signal from your brain . See the top screen here ? Those are your theta rhythms , nice healthy thetas . He 's only a three on susceptibility scale , we could be here all afternoon . I 'm gonna to perform V-C induction , Make a note of it . I 'll see that you 're not disturbed . Now , George . I 'd like you to relax . I 'd like you to look up at the ceiling . You don 't have a simple brain , my friend , nor a crazy one . Now , you 're beginning to get sleepy , George , very relaxed , so relaxed , you can 't move a muscle . Your eyelids are very heavy . You are going to go to sleep now , George . And while you 're sleeping , you 'll have no trouble hearing my voice . And you will wake up , when you hear me call your name three times . You are going to sleep now . Can you hear my voice , George ? Mhmm . Good . No sigmoid jags usually prevalent in schizophrenic personality types . Sleep patterns normal . Ah , you 're beginning to dream now , George . REM patterns unusual . Something very unusual here in the whole pontine area . When I say the word Antwerp you are going to have a dream that I suggest to you . It will be a pleasant , vivid dream about a horse in a meadow , beautiful site . It will be a good dream , George . An effective dream about a horse . Antwerp George ! George ! George ! Feel OK ? Yeah ! Well , you did dream , my friend ! That much I can tell you . What was it about ? A horse . It was about a horse . That one . What about it ? Don 't you notice anything unusual about that picture ? Oh , some people find it a bit overwhelming . You know what Freud said about horses , staircases and cigars ? - Was it here an hour ago ? - An hour ago ? Yes , wasn 't that a picture of Mount Hood when I came in ? Mount Hood ? Yeah , I remember it , don 't you ? George , that is Tammany Hall , the triple crown-winner . Oh , I 'm insane ! No , I 'm not insane ! I know I 'm insane . I know I 'm NOT insane ! - It 's enough to drive me insane ! - Back up , George ! Dreams are not harmful , for instance , day dreams can be wonderful . I have them all the time . I dream heroics . I save the girl , the whole damn planet . Haber saves the world ! Yeah , I daydream sometimes , that I have a cabin - by the ocean . - Eh , That 's nice . What does that tell you about yourself ? That I am a masochist . Nobody can afford a cabin by the ocean anymore . You know , what I 'd like to see , George ? I 'd like to see you learn to use your dreams . Now doesn 't that strike you as a nice idea ? I don 't know . Well , we 'll work on it . You 're feeling very sleepy , George . Very relaxed . You 're going to sleep in a moment . Now sleep George . Sleep ! In a moment I 'm going to suggest a dream to you . And you will dream that dream . You are going to have a very good dream , George . Beautiful sunshine , no smog , no rain . Antwerp ! What the hell is he doing ? The Augmentor is not doing that . - Penny . - Is something wrong ? No . No , nothing at all ! Doctor , are you all right ? Yes , yes of course ! - Get me a report on weather on the line . - Yes , Doctor ! George ! George ! George ! What did you dream , George ? It was an effective dream , I can tell you that . Can you recall it ? Yes . I was having a picnic on Mount Hood in the rain with Genghis Khan And his umbrella leaked . And then the sun came out . I have weather on line 2 , Doctor . Mrs. Crouch . Schedule for Mr. Orr for noon tomorrow . Can you make it , George ? - Yes , but why should ... - Good . Good . It 's actually stopped raining . All right , George , go on now . I 'll see you tomorrow . This is the weather report for Portland , the Sunshine city . The temperature is 105 degrees Fahrenheit , 40 degrees Celsius . Humidity is 8 % , the barometer is 29.80 You see , it 's because of all this sunshine ! We were better off when it rained all the time . Isn 't that the truth ! He knows ! He knows ! Son of a bitch knows ! - I 'm not insane , am I ? - Oh , no , of course your not ! Why didn 't you tell me back in the office ? George , I thought we had a very good session this afternoon . Extraordinary really . But don 't you think we can continue this tomorrow ? But , wait a minute , you 're acting like nothing happened . Oh , a great deal happened , but let 's not make more of it than it is ! We have a long way to go . My dream stopped the rain . George , it hasn 't rained in Portland since two years ago last Easter . Why are you doing this to me ? One cardinal rule of therapy George , Never hand the patients the answers on a silver platter . Now you must work for them otherwise they are meaningless . The sun is out ! - It stopped raining . - Yes , it 's beautiful , isn 't it ? You told me to dream a sunny day and I did , now you admit it . George , It 's impossible to correct a defective reality orientation over night . Now we 're making real progress . I 'll see you tomorrow . - But if you ... - Tomorrow ! - Orr ? - Yes . Heather Lelache . Won 't you be seated . Was this an accident ? - What ? - Your overdose . Ah .. no . YES ! My legal advice is agree to the psychiatric treatment and you won 't be prosecuted , or persecuted for that matter . But the therapy scares me . Oh come on , Mr. Orr . I don 't mean to cause Dr. Haber any trouble . I 'm sure he means well . - I 'd just like another psychiatrist . - Oh , not without real cause . I mean , they 're not gonna take a patient 's word against a doctor 's . Not in a case like this . - You mean a mental case . - Exactly . Well . Um ... Thank you very much , Miss Lelache ... Um .. - I 'm sorry to have bothered you . - One moment . I didn 't say you didn 't have a case . It 's just that ... Well you haven 't told me anything yet . If I told you what was really going on you 'd think I was crazy . I 'm a Civil liberties lawyer , Mr. Orr . If you have something to say you 'd better say it . He 's not an evil man and he means well . It 's just that ... I 'm in a position to be used by him , like an instrument . Now he can 't do that , even if his aims are good . Nobody can play God . But he doesn 't realize that . That 's why I tried taking drugs to suppress my dreams . - I just wanna get cured . - Of drugs ? Of dreaming ! You don 't know what the hell your talking about ? Ah , Miss Crouch , I 'd like you to do some research for me . Um , use the computer link-up to the Library of Congress in the lobby . Do you think the others will mind ? No , I don 't think so , Almost everyones gone to lunch . Good . I 'd like you to get me as much information as possible on the effect of dream symbology in pre-Columbian culture . - I may be a while . - Take as much time as you need . - Be very thorough , Miss Crouch . - Yes , Doctor . Listen carefully , George . You and I are about to embark upon a magnificent collaboration . We are going to make history today . Using your gift I 'm going to do what no politician , no scientist , no philosopher has ever done . I 'm going to make the whole world ... right ! We need an institute , The William Haber Institute of Oneirology . Antwerp ! George ! George ! George ! Take it easy , don 't sit up so fast . Oh , no ! - Something wrong , George ? - Doctor ? Oh , Miss Crouch ! I have that research information you wanted , Dr. Haber . That didn 't take you any time at all , did it ? Amazing what computers can do . Is there anything else , Dr. Haber ? Yes , I 'd like you to schedule Mr. Orr for noon tomorrow . - I can 't make it ! - Yes , Doctor ! - But I can 't make it ! - Why not ? Because I have a job ! Now I can 't keep coming here , they 'll fire me ! Your therapy is more important than your job ! In any case the institute will clear you . Look , don 't give me that institute stuff now , I know what 's going on here ! Aha ! A little active resistance ; It 's a good sign , George . Let it out ! Look ! You don 't know what you 're doing ! - Now you change one thing , you gonna ... - You see , you 're not really resisting me , you 're resisting your own self examination . - It happens in every therapeutic situation . - Look , I 'm not gonna do this anymore ! George , I had hoped that your motivation for being here would be better by now . What about getting well ? - Yeah , what about it ? You tell me ! - I am going to cure you , George . You have my word on that . You must believe me . I would like to believe you , Dr. Haber . I really would . Good . Then we have something in common . Why doesn 't this Dr. Haber just come right out and say that he knows you have effective dreams ? I think he 's waiting to find out more before he lets me know what 's going on . Can 't stand that I blame him . The thing that bothers me is what he 'll do next . What do you mean ? Unlimited power means unlimited danger . Well , according to you he 's only changed one painting and the weather . Not to mention small improvements to his office . - Then there 's the cabin . - What cabin ? I have a ten-year lease on a cabin overlooking the ocean . You do ? I won it in a Government lottery . Can I buy you a lunch ? Well I 'd really like to help you Mr. Orr , but What am I supposed to do if you keep changing the reality all the way back to the Stone Age , and then destroying the evidence ? Well I wouldn 't expect you to believe me without evidence . Oh , well , thank God ! What I 'd like is for you to come to a session . Doubtful without good cause . Well what am I supposed to do ? Let this guy keep treating me like an experimental animal - while he goes around tinkering ? - Did you say experimental ? Yeah . Well what do you mean ? Haber says he 's still working on it . Have you signed anything , any releases , anything beyond the VT forms and Consent to hypnosis ? - I don 't think so . - You 've got a case ! - I do ? - Mh mh - Great ! Let 's just keep one thing straight . This doesn 't mean I believe a word of your story . All it means is if I can prove this thing is experimental , then maybe just maybe I can get you switched to another shrink . - Then you 'll come to a session ? - Not as your lawyer . I 'll arrange to come as an HEW impartial observer on investigation of that thing a ma jigger , OK ? Dr. Haber . - Yes , Penny . - This just arrived , the population report you wanted . - Oh yes . - Dr. Murgin called on a consultation . - Tell him I 'm too busy . - And this notice is from HEW , they 're sending an observer this morning to look at the Augmentor . What ? Damn bureaucrats . - Why don 't they mind their own business . - Oh , and Mr. Orr is here , Doctor . Well , George . You 're early today . Something like a breakthrough , I 'd say , considering your usually 15 minutes late . I am ? - So , how are you feeling today ? - So-so . How can anyone feel so-so on a magnificent day like this ? Well , you know the Greeks say , Moderation in all things . So , what would you like to talk about today ? I don 't care . Do you have somewhere to go , George ? Oh , no . I 'm just anxious to get started . Well , another breakthrough . Two in one session . Shall we try for three ? - Yes , what is it ? - Miss Lelache from HEW is here . All right , send her . Seems that my fame has brought me to the attention of HEW . They 're sending an observer to make sure my work with the Augmentor is on the up and up . Isn 't that ridiculous ? Dr. Haber , this is Heather Lelache . A pleasure to meet you , Miss Lelache . Won 't you have a seat right here ? I assume you were informed I 'll be recording these proceedings . Perhaps , you 'd better ask the patient 's permission . Mr. Orr ! This is Miss Lelache of HEW . - Do you mind , Mr. Orr ? - No , go ahead . Very well . Dr. Haber is the patient diagnosed as neurotic or psychotic ? The patient 's diagnosis is not for public record , Miss Lelache . I 'm surprised at you . Besides it 's my Augmentor that interests you , right ? Well , anyway you know what they say ? Neurotics build castles in the sky , psychotics live in them . And psychiatrists collect the rent . Hm , very good . Very good , Miss Lelache . Well , have you any questions before we start ? Can you explain the role of your device ? Yes , of course . My Augmentor here merely insures that my patient will dream by instigating and reinforcing his own dream-state activity . What would you say , George ? - Shall we run off a dream ? - OK . Incidentally , Miss Lelache , this will constitute a record to your people that my Augmentor does not loosen toenails , harden arteries , blow your mind , or have any ill effects whatsoever . Standard hypnotic procedure , Miss Lelache . Though a bit disconcerting for the uninitiated , I will admit . Please , turn your recorder off . The therapy session is not for public record . Notice the accelerated pulse and the rapid eye movements . He is ready to accept a suggestive dream . Now , George , the last time you were here , you were telling me about something that bothered you very much . You said you felt restricted , and closed in on the subway , in your office , in the streets . Do you remember the word you used ? - What does he say ? - Overpopulation , that 's what he said . Now , George , when I say the word Antwerp you are going to have an effective dream about this thing that bothers you , this overpopulation . You 're going to dream about space , about all the elbow room in the world . You feel uncrowded , unsqueezed . And this overpopulation thing will not be a problem anymore . Antwerp ! My God ! What has he done ? Six billion people ! All the people ... all ... the people ... George . George ! George ! You had a bad one , George ! Where are they ? - Where are the people ? - You dreamt about the plague . - Plague ? - That 's all over now . All of us who survived are genetic clue resistant . - What plague ? - Oh , my God ! I just killed six billion people . I 'm afraid , it 's the first time Mr. Orr has handled anxiety in the dream . - It 's not always pleasant . - I don 't understand what 's happening . - Don 't you remember the plague ? - Of course , we do ! I lost my parents , my two sisters , I watch them die . None of us could ever forget it . But it 's over now , George . The plague ended five years ago and we are the survivors . Life must go on . You remember the plague , don 't you ? Don 't you remember that you 've never heard of the plague until just now ? But there wasn 't any plague until an hour ago . - You remember , don 't you ? Remember ! - George , Miss Lelache is hardly qualified to comment on your session . She 's only an observer . I 'm afraid he 's a bit agitated . it has been a difficult time . - Perhaps we 'd better adjourn . - Yes . I shall send you a full report on the Augmentor 's operation and current uses that should take care of it . I 'm sorry you 've found this distressing , Miss Lelache . But a ... you led a real crisis mission . Good bye . Thank you . Well , we really did it this time , didn 't we ? - Come away from the window , George . - You saw it ? She saw it ? Six billion people wiped off the face of the Earth . What do you want me to say ? I want you to be straight with me . Why don 't you go home , George ? Admit it ! Take responsibility for it ! Oh , I see , you 're trying to transfer it all to me . You want me to take responsibility for your problem . Well , I can 't do that , George . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry you had a bad dream , George . But it was your dream , it came from you , from inside of you ! I 'm cracking up . Surely , you can see that ! You 're a psychiatrist . I 'm gone to pieces here . You ask me to dream again and what kind of world are we going to get ? Maybe a totally insane one , full of monsters , demons or witches , dragons , all the things that we carry around inside us , all the nightmares , the fears ? What 's gonna happen when that gets loose on the world ? Are you quite finished ? Your negative approach to our ... It 's your positive approach , that 's the danger ! Solve the population problem ! See what happens ! Don 't you see that these things aren 't problems ? They don 't have answers that you can find in your arithmetic book . Defeatism . We were put here to make the world a better place . Your attempts to use my dreams To make the world a better place , can destroy it ! It 's not so hard to destroy the world , Dr. Haber . We did it four years ago , April . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Don 't think that you can outthink God . You 're worn out , George . You 'd better go home , get some rest , the session is over . - You ... - Go home , George . I don 't know where home is anymore . You 're acting like nothing happened . My dream stopped the rain . George , it hasn 't rain in Portland since two years ago last Easter . My God ! I just wiped out three quarters of the world 's population . - What do you want me to say ? - I want you to be straight with me . Why don 't you go home now , George ? My God ! Why are you doing this to me ? Damn ! George ? What are you doing here ? I want the truth . Well , come up to my office , we 'll discuss it . We 'll discuss it right here ! All right . If you insist . I suppose I should have told you earlier , George . I just wanted time to sort things out . Yes , I know about your dreams . I 've known for quite some time . Thank you . Thank you , Dr. Haber for being honest . You have a great gift , George . Together we can learn to use it . You can 't use my dreams to change things , haven 't you learned that yet ? Isn 't that the purpose of man on Earth ? To act . To change things . To run things . To build a better world . - No . - What then ? I don 't know . I don 't know . Things don 't have purposes . I don 't know if life has a purpose . I can 't say that it matters . It IS . We ARE . I wanna stop . George I know that I can learn to harness your power - but you must give me time . - That 's no use . - We haven 't got the right . - We have a duty ! Why do you resist ? Why do you fear your own power ? Because it doesn 't work . You change one thing and everything changes . The plague didn 't solve anything . We 're closer to war now than we ever have been . I can 't let you use me anymore . George , you need me , George . You know that . Without me you 're out of control . I want you to dream of peace on Earth . No more war , no more mass killings of humans by other humans , No more fighting in Asia , Africa , the Middle East , or anywhere in the world . Antwerp ! George ! George ! George ! - Snap out of it ! What are you doing ? - What ? I told you to dream peace on Earth . I didn 't dream that . I dreamt about the Moon . A battle . A battle in space . Alien force is attacking the Earth colony on the Moon . I don 't believe it . I tell you to dream away man 's inhumanity to man . And what do you do ? You united the world against the threat of an alien invasion . What a stupid wasteful way to get peace on Earth ! My God ! What kind of monsters have you dredged out of my unconscious ? I don 't know and I dreamed 'em . If only I could decipher your unconscious . This is incredible ! Aliens on the Moon . You must go back under , George ! Dream them away right now ! I told you something like this is gonna happen . - What are you doing ? - I 'm not gonna dream for you anymore ! Oh , that 's absurd , you can 't leave things like this . I did what you told me to do , I did what the doctors told me , the lawyers . Nothings worked ! - George ! - No , forget it ! George ! You 'll be back , George . Without me you have no hope . George ! George ! Yeah ? I 'm looking for George Orr , have you seen him ? No , he 's gone . Gone ? Where ? I don 't know . I heard him leave a few hours ago . Who are you ? Heather Lelache . I 'm his lawyer , I 've got to talk to him . Do you have any idea where he might be ? - You got some ID ? - Yes , HEW public investigator . All right , Well he might be in his cabin . Why don 't you try him there ? Well , a phone number , do you have a phone number ? No , he ain 't got no phone . Say , What 's so important anyway ? Did he do something ? Yes . Please , do you have an address ? Oh , I don 't know , it 's somewhere up on the Coast near Agate Beach , one of those Government lottery cabins . You 'll have to find it yourself . Thanks ! But you know it 's true , my dreams change everything . And you see why I have to get away from Haber . - I know . I understand . - He 's making me dream . You saw what happened . I can 't let him make me dream anymore . What happened with the aliens on the Moon . You don 't mean that you ... If you only knew how scared I really am right now . I just wish I could sleep without dreaming . Maybe you can ! Maybe I could suggest a dream . - No . - Sure . It could be a dream about nothing . - What do you mean ? - Nothing will happen , nothing will change . No , it 's too risky . It 'll work , I know it will . I 've seen it done before . I 'll just hypnotize you . I don 't know . We have no choice . Listen to the sound of my voice . Relax . Take yourself down . Farther . You feel relaxed and easy . That 's it . You 're floating . I 'm going to tell you to go to sleep . And you will , but not until I say it . Everything is heavy . You try to lift your hand but you can 't . It 's heavy . Oh , I think it 's working , George . Now , you 're gonna do some dreaming . You are going to have one effective dream . And it 's going to be about ... Oh , my God ! I can 't tell him to dream about nothing ! In this dream you will dream , everything is OK , dream the aliens off the Moon . Tomorrow , when you awaken , you will feel rested and well . Now , go to sleep . This is an invasion alert . An invasion alert ! Aliens are invading ! Invasion alert ! Invasion alert ! - George , wake up ! Something 's wrong ! - What 's the matter ? Don 't you hear that ? What did you tell me to dream ? That everything 's OK , the aliens off the Moon . That 's it . They 're off the Moon . They 're here . Come on ! We 've got to get back to Haber . - I thought we were trying to get away from him ? Yeah , but now we have no choice . Turn on the radio ! And in retaliation . Anti-Alien Ballistic Missiles have been dispatched from our underground installations in Walla Walla , Washington , and Round Valley , California ... It appears now from Command Center And this just in the alien ships appeared to be carrying a device that has taken control of our Missile Guidance system . - Where the hell have you been ? - It 's not important , we 're back . This is your doing , isn 't it ? You had a dream without me , didn 't you . I told you that this would happened , didn 't I , I told you ! It 's up to us now . Look , go down to the basement , find the main generator , put your finger to the on / off button . If the power fails you push it . Now go on ! I 'll be all right , George . Well hit it , Haber . George , something new . I want you to stop the invasion , George . Dream peace . Dream that we are at peace with everyone . Everyone ! Antwerp ! Come on . Come on ! Pardon me . Do not do to others what you wish others not to do to you . Of course not . Of course not ! We are attempting to make peaceful arrival , we do not have weapons . We are nonaggressive , unfighting species . Please , tell others . I can 't control the air force . George ! George ! Is this a military installation ? No . George ! George ! Please , excuse the accidental intrusion . Thank you very much . Well , that wasn 't so bad , was it ? Don 't play games with me ! You look scared to death . Ive just about had it with you , Orr . This is no joke . I could have been killed ! Well you sure to have thought of that before . You God damn subconscious twists around everything I say . He 's just an alien . Nice guy , you were talking with him . Well , I feel good . I 'm starving , I 'm gonna get something to eat and find Heather . You want a sandwich ? - What about the invasion ? - You heard him , they 're friendly . Weren 't you supposed to make a phone call or something ? Yes , of course ! But to whom ? Well , you know the people in Washington . Tell them to stop shooting at the aliens . - I 'll call Tchaikovsky at HEW . - Yeah ! I 'll See ya ! Secretary Tchaikovsky , please . Bill Haber calling . Hello , Nat ! Bill Haber here . Fine . Fine . Listen , Nat , about this alien thing . I think I 've gotten it figured out . I hate turbo fish . How do you feel ? - I was fine till I ate this . - Aha ! There you are ! Well , did you get everything straightned out ? - Oh , I 'd say so . - Good . Mmm , dreadful . Well , we 've eliminated war and hunger , we still can 't come up with a decent cup of coffee . You know , George . Before all of this alien business I had some good news for you . Oh , really ? You remember of course , that I gave you my word that I would cure you . Yeah , he did say that . He did . I know it 's been a very distressing time for you . But as soon as my Augmentor programing is complete you will be cured . So what do you say , you come along with me now and we 'll get to work on it . I don 't think so . Not today . Oh but , George , if you can be cured ! - Hey , wait a minute ! - Ah actually today would ... I have a big surprise for you , George . Just follow me . You know where I went wrong all of these months , I was searching for an entity . An omega-wave . Well there isn 't any . The pattern is formed by a combination of other waves . Now , over the past few days before all hell broke loose I worked it out . The cycle is 12 seconds . Can you imagine , 12 seconds ? I don 't know why I didn 't think of it before . No , your dream pattern is a complexly synchronized set of emissions that take exactly 12 seconds to complete their cycle and start again . It 's to an ordinary dream state what a Bach fugue is to Mary had a little lamb . I didn 't know this was here . Let me out of here ! George ? - Mh ? - My apologies , George . The greatest good for the greatest number . All right , George , Now we 're going to run a little test . Only one more axis and my Augmentor programming will be complete . One more . Then you will be superfluous . And I can get on with the job . Jor Jor . Jor Jor . Damn . To reprogram this whole last quadrant . Stupid chicken brain of his ! Take him down again , all the away ! If help wanted , inquire within . Power may be controlled only at source . I 'd hate to lose you , George . But you leave me no choice . Those whom heaven helps we call the sons of heaven . They do not reason by using reason . To let understanding stop at what cannot be understood is a high attainment . Those who cannot do it will be destroyed on the lathe of heaven . The lathe of heaven . Jor Jor . Jor Jor . All right , George . We are going to take on a really big one this time . Something that 's been wasting a lot of the world 's valuable time . Racism . When I say Antwerp I want you to dream me a world in which there is no color problem . Where everyone is completely integrated . Antwerp ! You did it , George ! You did it the rational way for once you really did ! Your primary process thinking went right to the heart of the problem and made the change biological and absolute ! It was the perfect solution , George ! You are to be congratulated . All right , back to work . Now , it 's time for our big moment . George . You 're about to have your last effective dream . Our partnership is almost at an end . I 'm going to give you something you 've always wanted - to be cured . Dream that you 've lost the ability to dream effectively . Dream me my ultimate Augmentor . Antwerp ! George . George . George . Welcome to Dr. Haber 's Palace of dreams . Congratulations , George . You are the man of the hour . How do you feel today ? - I haven 't felt anything for days . - You may go . Take it easy , George . Take it easy . I know , I 've been working you very hard . But I think you 'll agree it 's been well worth the effort . Besides , today is a momentous occasion . Well , I don 't think I can take another big day . George , today I 've cured you . - Don 't you have anything to say ? - Words fail me . It 's quite simple . You have had your last effective dream . - Wonderful . - In it ... you 've dreamt you lost the ability to dream effectively . - It 's that simple ? - Simple . But not that simple . My Augmentor here is now complete . The last piece of the puzzle is in . - By the way where is he ? - Who ? The alien . There are no aliens here , George . TNo they 're not permitted in this part of the building . They 're Ah ... unnatural . In fact , when I begin to dream they 're the first thing I 'm going to get rid of . Is that what you 've been up to all this time ? That 's right , George . The burden is now off your shoulders . And it on to yours ! You 're out of your mind ! Now you listen to me , George Orr ! You come into my office with the greatest power the mankind has ever known and all you want to do is to be cured of it . The dreams don 't work you tell me . They go wrong you tell me . Well , there 's nothing wrong with the dreams , my friend . The problem lies with the dreamer . Well now George , you must be tired . I think you should go home now ' get some rest . I 'll come down with you . You are an imperfect instrument , George . You are not a man of vision . - And you are ? - I know what I 'm doing . Scientifically and morally . After all , I 've been controlling your dreams for the past few weeks . And you can 't be entirely blind to what I 've accomplished already . Since we 've begun working together , George , we 've eliminated overpopulation . Restored the quality of urban life , the ecological balance of the planet , eliminated cancer as a major killer , eliminated racial hatred , the color problem , eliminated war , eliminated the risk of species deterioration through inferior genetic stock . Eliminated ... no , say , in the process of eliminating poverty , economic inequality , the class war all over the world . Progress , George , progress . You 're right , George . The greatest good for the greatest number . Progress , George , progress . We have made more progress in six weeks than humanity has made in the past six thousand years . Well do you think with all this progress you can help me to find Heather . Who ? - Heather Lelache , the lawyer from HEW . - Oh , yes . What happened to her ? I don 't know , she 's gone . Oh , she 's out there somewhere . I doubt it . She was brown not gray . Well ! Our time has come to an end , George . The symbiotic relationship is over . But a new era begins . Good-bye , George . Hey , Haber ! What ? I was just thinking ... wouldn 't it be funny if I wasn 't the only one who could dream effectively . What if everybody could do it ? And reality was being ... pulled out from under us all the time . And we didn 't even know it . Well , it 's just a thought . I 'll sleep on it . Good day , Jor Jor . Jor Jor ? - You , Jor Jor . - Me ? - No , my name is George Orr . - Right , Jor Jor . OK , Jor Jor . How did you know my name ? Field of perception is mutual . Do you wish an object ? - No , I 'm just looking . - Please . Continue this activity . I don 't suppose you know a woman named Lelache ? - Do you seek Lelache ? - Yes , I 've lost her . Person sought can be found . Help is available . Is it acceptable ? Heh ... Yes , I mean thank you very much . Clarity is pleasurable . With a little help from my friends ? What would do think if I sang out of tune , Would you stand up and walk out on me . Lend me your ears and I 'll sing you a song , And I 'll try not to sing out of key . Oh ! I get by with a little help from my friends , Mmm ... I get high with a little help from my friends , I 'm Gonna to try with a little help from my friends . What do I do when my love is away ? ( does it worry you to be alone ) How do I feel by the end of the day ? ( are you sad because you 're on your own ) Whoa ... I get by with a little help from my friends , Do you need anybody , I need somebody to love . I get by with a little help from my friends . Hi , sleepyhead ! Heather ! Ah ... and just who were you expecting ? My wonderful wife ! - Yeah . - You 're brown ! Oh , I 'm sorry , this model only comes in one colour . What 's wrong ? Ha Ha ! Ahh , Oh I slept so well . Mmm ... Yeah , you needed it to . You came home half dead last night . Mmm ? That stupid shrink Haber sends you home that way and says you 're cured . Mmm ... Haber ... Forget him , George , you 're free now . We 're together and , well , we can be happy . - What is it ? - I don 't know . What is it , George ? Let 's get out of here . Manny ! Manny ! Manny ! George , I 'm scared . I 've never felt anything like this before . I have . 4 years ago . What 's going on ? - Oh , God , it 's happening again ! - What ... what 's happening ? 4 years ago , 4 years ago in April . Don 't you remember ? Nobody does but me . - What happened 4 years ago ? - that 's when everything started ... Then it ended . George ! George ! What the hell is this , George ? What did you mean , 4 years ago in April ? What happened ? There was a war . They said the bomb dropped right down by the river . I was trying to get out of the city . Guess I had radiation sickness already . I guess I was dying . And I had this dream that I was alive . Ever since then I 've tried to tell myself that was a dream . But it wasn 't . This is the dream . Haber ! I can 't ! I can 't do it ! Haber ! Haber ! Haber ! Jor Jor ! Jor Jor ! Jor Jor ! Fatigue is evident . I did a lot today . At least I did something . Probably the only thing I ever did . You have lived well . May I see that egg whisk , please ? Heather ? Do I know you ? We met a long time ago . - You 're a lawyer , right ? - Yes . - How did you know ? - You want that ? Oh ... No . Thank you . You were very good to me . Good . Listen ! Ah ? Yes ? I was wondering if I could return the favor . Can I take you to lunch ? - Well thank you , but ... - I mean if you have the time . OK . Why not . I 'll be back in an hour , E 'nememen Asfah . - Take afternoon , there is time . - Thanks ! To go is to return . Dr. Haber ? Dr. Haber ? I don 't think he can hear you . - What happened to him ? - Nobody seems to know exactly . He was on the verge of an enormous discovery . And now ? A breakdown . Ever since the night that everything fell apart , you know ? You 've seen it , haven 't you ? The world after April . - Who was that ? - Someone I knew once . I 'm starving . Let 's go have that lunch . Lead the way .

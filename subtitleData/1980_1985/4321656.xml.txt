 We have taken control of 20 nuclear missile silos . Two days for your friend to come around with the key to the code . Or , by God , we can all kiss this whole world goodbye . He 's dead . BADHAM : The nuclear arms race has held humanity at ransom long enough . Somehow , this madness must be brought to an end . Therefore , in the interest of world peace , I have taken a rather drastic action . We have taken control of 20 nuclear missile silos , 10 in the United States , and 10 located in the Soviet Union . These sites have been activated to a pre-launch mode , set to fire simultaneously in four days ' time . This is your final warning ! Unless all nuclear weapons are disabled throughout the world by noon of December the 31st , these missiles will be detonated automatically . If total disarmament is not achieved , then may God help you . May God help us all . Well , we 've all heard it . Now , what the hell are we doing about this fruitcake ? I 'm afraid he 's more than a fruitcake , General Harrisburg . Dr. Lawrence Taylor Badham . Oxford scholar in computer science . Nobel Peace Prize nominee two years in a row back in the ' 60s . That 's when he dropped out of the system . The information gets sketchy after that . So tell me , Newman , what turns a peacenik brain like Badham into a political extortionist ? I mean , by God , he 's willing to set off World War Three ! My guess would be the Cypress Party . The Cypress Party ? What have those radicals got to do with this ? Plenty . According to British Intelligence , they are the money and muscle behind Badham 's plan . I 've heard of them derailing arms shipments and sabotaging nuclear tests , but something like this is out of their league . Well , not anymore . We 've located them on the Isle of Dundee in the North Sea , off the coast of Scotland . They 've set up their operations in a deserted distillery . Is your team in place ? Yes . Major Mike Rivers has already infiltrated their group through our British operatives . He 's going to try linking their computer system with Airwolf 's so we can override their missile commands . That 's good . I hope your boys are as good as I 've heard , little lady . They are , General . Hmm . Mike should have contacted us by now . Give him time . That 's one thing we haven 't got . Once we have the computer link established , all we have to do is unscramble whatever code Badham has used to reprogram the missile sites . Right . Nothing to it . ( INAUDIBLE ) No , Angus , you can 't play with the computer . But how about another story ? Now , what will it be ? We read The Pied Piper yesterday . What about Jack and the Beanstalk ? Go get the book then . Hmm ? LOCKE : He 's in ! We 've got it . MIKE : Oh , great ! Now what ? ( SIGHS ) Stay away from that ! What are you doing ? It 's over , Badham . Who are you ? Never mind that . What 's the access code ? Angus , get Pervis in here . ( GUN FIRING ) ( GROWLS ) Hey , can 't you take a joke ? ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Get him ! I want him alive ! We lost it ! I 'm taking us in . Get him out of there . Quickly . SAINT JOHN : They 're taking him inside now . He doesn 't look good . LOCKE : Can you get him out ? What about Badham ? I don 't know . I 'm gonna need some kind of diversion to make any moves . Give me five minutes to get inside . When I give the signal , hit them with everything we 've got . SAINT JOHN : I 'll meet you at the pickup point . LOCKE : Right . I wish I 'd thought of that . It 's over . Finished ! I haven 't come this far just to quit now . It 's too great a risk . They know where we are ! If they attempt to tamper with the system , they could cause the missiles to launch . Just find out who he 's working for and we 'll stop them . The plan can still work ! No ! I 'm aborting the launch command . Perhaps you 've forgotten who 's running this operation . No . You have . ( GROANS ) Get him out of here ! ( ANGUS SCREAMING ) Where are the rest of your men , laddie ? Go to hell . I 'd like to show you something I picked up on a trip to China recently . Wonderful people , the Chinese . They 've given us so much more than gun powder and fortune cookies . I think you 'll find this will loosen your tongue . Now , Jason . Mike . Mike ! ( GRUNTING ) How is he ? He 's dead . He can 't be ! He can 't . Let 's take him home . ( ALARM BUZZING ) I 'm sorry , Jo . There was nothing we could do . I know . ( SOBBING ) I 'm sorry about your man . Were you able to complete the mission ? No , sir . We were too late . Dr. Badham was killed by his own men . What the hell ? All right , we 'll pick up the ball from here . We 've got men standing by to move in . Yes , sir . We 'll keep you posted . It wasn 't your fault . We 've got a long trip ahead of us . Better run a diagnostic check . Running diagnostic . We 've got enough fuel to make it home . ( LOCKE TYPING ) Saint John ! I 'm reading three heartbeats ! What ? Mike 's alive ! Hang in there , buddy . Hang in there . What 's happening ? LOCKE : Come on . Breathe ! Come on , breathe ! Damn it , breathe , Mike ! Locke ? It 's working ! You 're gonna make it , buddy . You 're gonna make it . The respiration is stabilizing but the heart rate is still down . Come on , Mike . Stay with us . No . No , I want a full team in there now ! Well , bring them in from every British base . I want that distillery torn apart ! Mike 's alive . He 's strong . He 'll pull through . Well ? Whatever those people injected him with it seems to have suspended his metabolism to a comatose state . The head trauma alone should 've killed him . It 's the damndest thing I 've ever seen . Is he going to make it ? The transfusion has brought his vital signs back to normal but he 's still in a coma . So what 's next ? All we can do is wait , and hope he wasn 't deprived of oxygen for too long . Perhaps you 'd like to see him . ( SIGHS ) How long has it been ? Almost nine hours . My so-called experts over there , they 've come up with nothing . They couldn 't crack the code . What are the Soviets doing ? What do you think they 're doing ? They 've put their forces on full alert . They don 't give a damn who pushes the buttons , so long as they can shoot back ! Haven 't you disarmed the silos yet ? ( CHUCKLES ) It doesn 't work that way , little lady . Look , say we pull the plug on all of our missiles , what if the Russians don 't ? Are you willing to take that chance ? I didn 't think so . Two days . Lady , gents , two days for your friend to come around with the key to the code . Or , by God , we can all kiss this whole world goodbye . ( SIGHS ) I wish it was me in there instead of Mike . He was always a good idea man . He might have come up with a plan . ( SIGHS ) I haven 't got a plan . I was hoping you had a plan . You don 't have a plan ? Oh , great ! SAINT JOHN : All right , look , what we need is one of your diversions . My diversions ? Why not one of your diversions ? I don 't do diversions . Don 't do diversions . All right , look . Go to plan B. Plan B ? What 's Plan B ? We make it up as we go along . Come on . ( SIGHS ) ( SIGHS ) He never was short on luck . I just hope he 's got some left . He has to . ( SIGHS ) Mike was always a survivor . LOCKE : Rivers . Major Rivers . Hello , Locke . I thought you were supposed to be on some sort of survival training course . Where are the others ? Oh , they 'll catch up in two , three hours . I 'd offer you a drink but I seem to have run out of glasses . I 've got a new assignment for you . Sorry , I 'm all booked . Well , get unbooked . You got yourself a new partner , partner . Orders ? Does it say I can 't finish my drink first ? Cheers . He would never let any of us down . No , he wouldn 't . He 's always been there for me . ( EXCLAIMS ) ( PANTING ) May I have this dance ? Let 's get out of here . He was always there . " Is " always there . Yeah , sorry . He 's coming out of it . Oh , don 't get too excited . He 's not out of the woods , yet . Can we see him ? Mike ? Mike ? He may not be lucid just yet . Ah , he 's coming around . How 's the headache , pal ? Welcome back to the world of the living , Mike . There was never any doubt . Right , Mike ? What are you talking about ? I don 't know you people . MIKE : I 'm not dead ! You can 't leave me here . I 'm alive ! Listen to me . ( INAUDIBLE ) Don 't leave me here ! No ! ( GASPS ) Mike . You 're all right . It 's okay , buddy , we 're here . LOCKE : Take it easy , Mike . I don 't know . Think ! Damn it ! We 've got less than 36 hours ! I 'm trying . It 's just not there . That 's enough for now ! Try to reach him . General , have your men turned up anything at the distillery ? Not a damn thing ! I 'm headed over to the Isle of Dundee to take charge of the operation . If you get anything , I mean , anything at all , radio ahead to Dundee . Damn ! You feeling better ? Jo . You remember . Yeah , it comes back in pieces like a jigsaw puzzle . The doctor said it would . Yeah , I guess so . Jason . Saint John . I 'm Saint John . Saint John . What the hell kind of name is that ? Saint John , what do you make of this ? Huh ? Saint John . ( LAUGHING ) What do you mean " Saint John " ? Saint John ! Saint John . It 's British . It 's a British name . You know , Saint John . Saint John . My father named me after a guy he flew with in the war . Aw ! Stringfellow , now there 's a weird name . There 's a guy who got into fights at school . " Stringfellow " ? ( BOTH LAUGHING ) Stringfellow , he was your brother ? That 's right . What else ? Do we have a big black helicopter of some kind ? Yeah , we 've been known to fly around in one occasionally . Saint John ? Jo ? Hey , would one of you guys answer me ? Look , Dr. Keith suggested we take you on a crash course down memory lane . You think you 're up to it ? I don 't know . I don 't have a choice , do I ? You remember this place ? You live here . So do you , for now . ( SIGHS ) Don 't tell me . She threw you out . I wouldn 't say " threw me out . " I 'd just say that we came to a mutual agreement that maybe I shouldn 't live there anymore . At 2 : 45 in the morning ? Yeah , well , you know ... I mean , timing was never my strong point . Well , where do you want me to put my stuff ? Have I paid my half of the rent yet ? We 'll talk about that later . Come on . We 've got a lot of ground to cover . I knew I 'd put it somewhere . ( CHUCKLING ) Can you hear it this time , Jason ? ( HELICOPTER APPROACHING ) Music to my ears . You 're starting to get the picture now , eh , Mike ? I was on a mission of some kind . Scotland . I was supposed to bring something back . It 's not coming . It 's not there . Let me show you something . Come here . ( TYPING ) Badham . That 's right . ( INAUDIBLE ) I was supposed to get a code . That 's good , Mike ! What was it ? There isn 't much time . I don 't know . ( SIGHS ) Don 't know or don 't remember ? Think , Mike . I can 't . We can 't give up . Not now . All right . All right . Uh ... Maybe if I talk to Badham . He 's dead . You 're all we 've got . Then take me back to Scotland . You 've gotta take me back . I ... I have to try . He 's right . There 's no time to waste . Let 's go . ( ALARM BUZZING ) Less than four hours to launch . Can 't she go any faster ? What the ... Russian MiGs coming in fast from behind ! That 's impossible ! We 're nowhere near Soviet airspace . Tell that to them . This missile scare is breaking all the rules . Well , we haven 't got time to stop for a geography lesson . Missile off port . Releasing chaff decoy . Looks like we found a yellow one . That 's fine with me . Almost there . We 've got the computer all warmed up and ready to roll . I just hope the memory 's all there . Yeah , I can identify with that . Major ? Major ! Over there . Yeah . Yeah , I know the way . Uh , how about Jack and the Beanstalk ? Go get the book then . Hmm ? What is it , Mike ? A book . Badham had a notebook . There was no book . My men have torn this place apart . Angus . Who the hell is Angus ? Hi , Angus . How is the frying pan ? I 'm sorry about Dr. Badham . He was your friend , wasn 't he ? He used to read those stories to you ? You mind ? I 'll bring it back to you , I promise . I 'll be back . Okay , fairytale titles . Badham could have used these titles as code names . That 's nothing but a child 's book from Marbles out there . MIKE : The last entry . The Pied Piper . All right , we 've got less than an hour . Let 's give it a try . Right . ( TYPING ) We 're almost there . " Almost " could be eternity . ( ALARMS BLARING ) ( EXHALES ) Think , Mike . But how about another story ? Hmm ? Well , what will it be ? We read The Pied Piper yesterday . Uh , how about Jack and the Beanstalk ? Jack and the Beanstalk . Badham didn 't put it in his book , but he put it in the computer . Try it . Beanstalk . That 's it , that 's got it ! Mr. President , they did it . Now to deactivate the system . ( TYPING ) Stand by , one . My God , one of them didn 't respond . One of theirs or one of ours ? One of theirs . Poskov . Mr. President , we 've got a problem . Can we stop it ? Not from here . If the missile 's launched , the President has authorized cancellation of first-strike response . How much time do we have ? She 's launched . What 's its trajectory ? Heading for upstate New York . Don 't miss this one , boys . Twelve minutes prior to impact . What 's our best shot ? There 's only one . LOCKE : We have to catch it before it drops , or it 'll be travelling too fast to track . Our only hope is to nail it with the laser as it reaches its apex . MIKE : Twelve minutes prior to impact . You 'll have to work out the dispersal of the laser over that great a distance . At best , it 's only a guess . Do we have any other choice ? ( BEEPING ) Approaching 52,000 feet . Eight minutes to impact . It 's starting to drop . Happy New Year , General Harrisburg . ( EXHALES ) Well , she hung together pretty well . Considering what we put her through , we 're lucky she 's still around . We 're lucky anybody 's still around , as close as we came . ( SIGHS ) You know , I almost wish Badham had succeeded . Total disarmament ? I wish it was that easy . Isn 't it ? It 's all here . Badham was a brilliant scientist . He had the right idea . He just went about it the wrong way . ( CHUCKLES ) Pied Piper . Fairytales . Yeah , he believed them . So what ? I mean , think about it . I mean , in all those stories there 's good versus evil . A good guy wins and they live happily ever after . Is there anything wrong with that ? Not a thing . Party time , people . ( ALL CHEER ) Present from the Company . ( ALL CHATTERING ) SAINT JOHN : I don 't mind if I do . Excuse me . ( ALL EXCLAIM ) Good shot ! Nice shot ! ( ALL LAUGHING ) You remember how to do this , don 't you ? Yeah . Sure do , Saint John . Oh , I was just kidding . ( ALL LAUGH ) It was pretty touch and go there for a while . Okay . While we 're on the subject , I 'd like to make a toast to the return of Mike Rivers . You know , Mike , we thought we 'd almost lost you . Welcome back , buddy . Here 's to you . Here 's to fairytales . ( INAUDIBLE )

You 're shakin like a leaf , man ! You 're happy of you now ? You and your bullshit ! - ( Inaudible ) Look ! - It 's not my fault ! Shit ! Shit ! The garbage dump is stuck in the fender ! You 're too crazy , man ! Hurry up ! Get in or we 'll get caught ! - ( Inaudible ) - I don 't care ! As long as it 's rollin , we 're alright ! We 'll see about that later . But slow down now ! Alright . You forgot to close the door in the back ! You hear that noise ? You 've got some nerves ! Now you 're yelling at me now ! Stop it then ! - Come have a look ! - What 's the matter ? Look . - What 's up ? - I told you to look . Shit ! - We didn 't need this . - You see the result of your bullshit ? - You should stop drinking . - Your hands are shaking . Thanks . - You should stop drinking . - Your hands are shaking . Thanks . It seems incredible that nobody discovered the " parcel " . I 'm so worried I can 't sleep . You imagine the cops reaction when we explain them we did not do it on purpose , it 's the first time it happens to us and it won 't happen again and all the rest .. You 're right . It 's hard to believe . Now ... maybe he has been picked up by one of our teams . How did you learn the news ? Telephone call . Anonymous . We put you in deep shit , no ? It will be alright this time , but it must not happen again ! Maybe he has been eaten by dogs ! Very funny ! You 're back in bullshit mode again ! Come on , I 'm not going to cry . More extraordinary things happen everyday . I 'm sure it 's that wacko who stole him . - You remember him ? - Which wacko ? The nutcase always hanging in the morgue . He 's always looking at the corpses . - When did he start to do that ? - A few weeks ago . Since a while he 's there all day long . Each time the ambulances come and go . A real chief of ambulance ! - What do you mean ? - Last week a morgue employee has been fired for traficking corpses . What kind of traffic ? - He was solding corpses to the guys making crash-tests for cars . - It seems it 's much better than mannequins . - Real nice ! Maybe we could take care of this guy ourselves ? - What do you think ? - Why not ? - Are you alright , man ? - I 'm OK . What 's next now ? Nothing . There 's nothing to do . He won 't come a second time . Let 's go home . Let me go ! Are you alright ? It 's Ok . I 'm not hurt . You 're sure ? - I 'm taking you to the hospital . - No , I 'm alright . I insist , please . Get in my car . Get in my car . Get away ! Let her go . Maybe she 's hurt ! Let her go ! Shit ! Get away ! Fuck ! - It 's enough now ! - I told you to get away ! Go now ! Don 't you understand ? I 'm buying it from you . What do you want to buy ? The corpse . Believe me . You 'd better let me take care of the situation . We must act fast . With me there will be no investigation from the police . - You 're alright ? - Yes , I 'm Ok . I don 't know how I can thank you . People helping you instinctively like that are so rare . Yes . I 'm not sure I made a good thing . He was ... He was your friend ? No ... he was my boss . I 'll explain later . - On your right . - Anyway , nobody will regret him . You have a nice home . You 're alright ? I 'll serve you a coffee . Very handy . It 's already made up . Where are the cups ? Is there any way to know what you do in life ? No . It makes me more mysterious . If I tell you the whole story now maybe you would not want to see me again . If I want to see you again I don 't even know how to reach you . It 's better this way . I will make the first step . With my job it will be very difficult to see each other . You see ? I was right . You really want to see me again now . Listen . Do as you want . I can 't tell you better . I must go now or I 'll be late at the hospital . - I 'm not too badly hurt ? - No , you 're fine . So ... maybe it 's the last time I see you . Don 't forget to shut the door when you leave . A collection , a museum maybe ... A museum . Do not be afraid of words . A museum about what ? - Flotsam and jetsam ? - Lines ... shapes , volumes ... Lines , shapes , volumes ... Yes , it 's true . It 's even astonishing . The most astonishing is that never an insignificant piece was brought to me . It never happened . Or maybe two or three times ... The sea ... is a sculptor of genius . She only rejects masterpieces . Her greatest glory is in her rejects . You 're an extraordinary man . - I do not see how . - I do . - You 're here on earth . - Like all of us . - Billion rich . You can buy yourself the most precious things , gems , masterpieces . But you don 't . You 're buying floating woods . You didn 't find a solution yet to protect yourself from these sound assaults ? I 'm still waitin for the sixth . - It 's a difficult mission . - On the contrary it is very easy . No . Don 't believe it . Under your conditions , it is very difficult . Get some help . If someone is undiscreet I 'll be the first to pay . Pay them . You can afford it . With money you will buy the corpses and the silence . You give me the shivers . You take a look so new on everything . You probably see what it reminds me . I mostly see that my program is down . And that is very serious . - Give me some time . - A few days . - A few weeks . - No . I beg of you . You should not have agree . Everything now depends on you . Shall that prospect stimulates you . It 's your usual method to give me strength . Why don 't you contact the couple who gave you the last corpse ? It was a very good corpse . It was an accident . If I must wait for the chance to renew . Why worry you ? It 's not your business . Pay . Double offers . To them to fend for themselves . The young man is an hospital intern . Am I right ? He 's not interested by money . Be threatening . Don 't worry about what these two youngsters may say . Instead look what they fear . Their dark side . That 's the deal . 5 millions for you if you agree . I 'd like to understand . For your sake , the less you know , the better you will be . I need the body of a young woman of about 25 years . I don 't know if Patrick will agree . It 's beautiful , huh ? Hello ! You see , I keep my promises . Well ... I present Coretta to you . Jean-Pierre and Jean-Loup . Hello and bravo . It 's a wonderful engine you have . A motorbike like this must cost a fortune . Sure . But when you want something money is not a problem . You found a job apparently . You have no more problem . I may have found work , but it does not mean that I have no more problems . Of course . Still no way of knowing what you 're doing . You must imagine that it gives you charm . I love men who have a sense of humor . We don 't want to bother you . We 're going to work . See you later . Do not linger too much . Come on , don 't be stupid . You make me visit your hospital ? It has no interest . If we could live all our life without going in such a place it would be better . Well . I must go . I don 't want to be late . See you when ? I don 't know . We 'll see . Soon probably . What 's the matter ? Are you alright ? No . I do not plan my life . But we will not make a fuss . Alright , I 'm sorry . Come on . Up if you 're not a chicken ! You know what I did ? No but I 'm about to find out . I visited a morgue . Funny way to spend your time . It 's amazing the number of bodies that nobody wants . You know . When you 're dead it does not have much importance . It 's true . Besides , if we took one person would notice . Probably . But I wonder why we would take one . To win 50.000 francs for instance . - You 're tryin to fool me ? - I don 't see why I would do this . Stop now ! - What ? - Stop now ! - What 's the matter with you ? - Leave me in peace . I understood what you meant . Shit ! You paid the bike with money from the crazy guy . Didn 't you ? If you see me again it 's not for my beautiful eyes . It 's because you want me to offer you a corpse . It 's enough . I manage to get home by myself . Shit ! Go away ! It sucks ! Hey , Sir ! Hey ! - Can you please take me to the village ? - Of course . Get back . - Thank you . - At your service . Sit down . - Thank you . - I only drink wine . What do you do in life ? I sing . Where ? In cabarets . Anywhere . You got talent ? No . Why are you doing this job then ? I don 't know . Because I started it . I like it too . Anyway I can 't do anything else . And then there 's lots of people doing jobs that do not suit them . And they 're very well satisfied with it , right ? Do you have good news ? No . You still have a few days . Listen ... I think it 's useless because Patrick don 't agree . I 'm feeling better . At the thought of giving you this news I was sick . For you too it is a lot better . You will be able to make alternative arrangements . I think I 'll leave . I will give you the money back as soon as I can . Come back . It 's not my fault . It 's Patrick . He doesn 't want . I think it 's useless to talk about it . Yet I feel that you will still do it . Follow me . Third and last call . Very Urgent . A 25 year old woman . In perfect health . Weight indifferent . Middle class . Suitable . Meridionale of preference . Delivery on April 14 . In short you fit the description . I hope I can count on you . Hello ? Hello ? Answer please . Say your name . Say your name . Hello ? A number . Give me a number . Hello ? Hello ? What 's happening with you ? Where are you ? Stop your bullshit . Tell me where you are . I 'm coming . Of course , I love you . Silly girl ! What did you do ? Don 't move . I 'm coming . I love you . What 's the matter with you ? Are you crazy ? I 'm so sorry . Since you know me you do not stop having problems . Don 't say nonsense . After all , maybe I like having problems . Anyway I 'm doomed . Doctor ? Doctor . 7 just passed . The heart no longer beats . She 's dead . Death certificate . You know what you have to do now . Hello ? Coretta ? It 's Patrick . No , no . I count on you for tonight . It 's exactly what we need . Ok . I 'll meet you as agreed . Take care of the ambulance . Yes . See you later . Door . Wait for me . It 's clear . We 're going . Be careful . Now . You 're coming back with the ambulance . And I 'll open the door for you . Ok ? I don 't have the ambulance . What do you say ? It was not parked in its place . So I took your car . My car ! Open the trunk . No . We can not put her inside . We 'll put her in the back seats . Come on ! Hurry up ! - What 's wrong ? - I can 't do it . Come on . Get out . You 're good to put people in trouble . It 's not my fault . Listen . I 'm going to tell you something . I 'm fed up with you and your dirty tricks . I 'll go through this but when it 's over I drop you to a taxi station and I never want to hear from you again . She 's not too damaged ? No . She committed suicide . It 's perfect . Perfect . Perfect . - I give you the money . - No . Keep your money . We don 't want it . I only ask you ... to keep my friend alone now . I have your word ?

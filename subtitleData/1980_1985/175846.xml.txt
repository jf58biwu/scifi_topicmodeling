 Gunneson ... Threshold Season 1 Episode 2 " Trees Made of Glass " ( Part 2 ) Gunneson ... you 're ... you 're not yourself ! We can help you . Please ? Sah vaah norah whee . Federal agents . Federal agents . - What ? - Whoa , whoa . Orders from Cavennaugh . We 've had your entire team under surveillance . He-He-He 's down there ! Lights ! Where are they ? There 's a-a switch on the ... on the ... on the post to your right ! He 's not here . Well , that 's impossible . We 've searched the whole room . He 's not down here . All right , talk to me . - It was Gunneson . - How is that even possible ? Are you telling me he swam 80 miles to shore after getting shot four times ? It 's a good question . It 's not like he could have grabbed a life preserver . We blew up his damn ship . And how 'd he find this house ? Why come here ? Look , there 's a lot of folks checking this out . What 's our cover story ? We 're saying it was a home invasion , attempted rape . Oh , yeah , Caffrey 's gonna love that . What about the local police ? Who 's Bigfooting them ? I already took care of it . Told them we were FBI . All right . Getting your hands dirty , Fenway ? Not that often I get to practice my forensics . I spend most of my days in a lab chatting with test tubes and cell cultures . Glamorous life of a pathologist . Well , I brought you a coffee . It 's okay to set this here ? Don 't spill it . What have you got ? - Footprints . - I can see that . We 'll run an analysis of the soil , see if we can ... backtrack how he got here . Well , I 'm guessing he didn 't take a cab . You old enough to drink coffee ? Oh . Uh , no , thanks . Never after 9 : 00 . Besides , I 'm wired enough as it is . Anything ? Plenty . I 'm picking up some weird magnetic anomalies here , which is interesting in itself , but this is really unnerving . Looks like Gunneson left us a parting gift . Is it the same pattern you saw on the ship ? It was on all the electronic displays . You have any strange dreams last night ? Beg your pardon ? As I understand it , Dr. Caffrey and Mr. Cavennaugh both had the same nightmare , saw similar things . Yeah , I heard that , I heard that . You watched the same videotape of the UFO they did . You were the only three . Figured you might have had the dream , too . I hardly slept last night . No dreams . You sure about that , my friend ? Yeah , I 'm positive . There 's nothing 's wrong with us , right ? Dr. Fenway tested our blood . He said we 're not infected . Our theta-waves are a little off . It 's no big deal . Let me know what else you find . You doing all right ? Thanks . 290 million people in the United States , and he makes his way to your front door . Why ? I don 't know . But the more disturbing question is , how did he find me ? You didn 't get one for me ? I could use a jolt . Is that my underwear in your hands ? - Yes . - Drop it . Did Gunneson say anything to you ? He ... He was trying , but , his , uh ... his words were all mixed up . If I 'd heard it , I could have helped . Too bad we don 't have a recording . Actually , we do . You had my house bugged ? Just interpreting your plan . " Safety of the Red Team at all costs , " right ? Gunneson , you 're ... you 're not ... yourself . We can help you . Please ? Sah vaah norah whee . Sah vaah norah whee . - Sah vaah norah whee . - Doesn 't make sense to me . Well , that 's because you 're not a linguist . It 's word salad . Expressive aphasia . Common in stroke victims . They garble their words , they say things backwards . God knows what was happening to Gunneson on a neurological level , but I think it might be something similar . Now , if we play it backwards , we get this . You 're one of us . You 're one of us . You 're one of us . You 're one of us . The signal from that object affected every living thing on the boat . If Gunneson made it to shore , chances are , the other crew members survived , as well . So , we 're dealing with a total of seven potential alien infectees . Got Captain Manning , Lieutenant Novak , Crewmen Sanford , Sonntag , Park and Pena . We 've got to find them . Containment is the first priority , per the Threshold Protocols . We 've already begun surveying their homes , family members and friends . I 'm sorry , but has anyone stopped to think that maybe we should be staking out ourselves ? I 've doubled the watch on all of you . We 're covered . Like she was covered ? By the way , what are we gonna tell these guys 'families ? Their sons died at sea . Oh . That 's gonna go over great when they show up on Mom 's doorstep covered in seaweed . Can we move on now ? Fire away . Signal telemetry ? It 's an engineer 's middle name . What about it ? I need you to break that signal down into its mathematical components . Uh , look for any pattern or form of communication . Ramsey , you can help him out . Now , Fenway , you said the signal was modifying human DNA . We need more specifics . Yeah , like , can the process be reversed ? Can we inoculate ourselves against it ? If you want me to figure out how this " bio-forming " works , I 'm gonna need a live specimen . Then we 'll get you one . And his name is Gunneson . Whatever else is happening , I think a part of him genuinely came to me for help . I could see it in his eyes . There 's a war going on inside him . Uh , hey , uh , guys , can I talk to you for a second ? Uh , I don 't know if you 're aware of this or not , but I 'm supposed to be getting married in six weeks . - We 're aware . - Oh , okay , okay . So , uh , what am I supposed to tell my fiancee ? I mean , uh , I 've been gone for two days . You 're not telling her anything . We 'll take care of it . What is that supposed to mean ? As far as I 'm concerned , the entire Red Team should be sequestered until this whole mess is over . Especially after what happened last night . No , it 's counterproductive . I already ... I already covered this in the plan . If we strip these people of their support systems , they won 't be able to function as well . As long as we 're asking our team members to relocate , we need to do the same with any spouses or family members . You 're confident of that ? Absolutely . Part of crisis management is looking after the welfare of your team . Lose sight of that , and we end up with a plan that 's gonna fall apart faster than we can make a new one . Then I guess I 'll defer to you . We 're already drafting a cover story for your work here . We 'll see if we can 't fold your intended into it , as well . Much appreciated . I found traces of sodium , sulfur and calcium in the mud from these boot prints . That doesn 't give us much . Those elements are found everywhere . Mm-mmm . Not in this particular combination . Spent activated alumina . It 's used to remove arsenic in water treatment facilities . We 've got three possibilities . Three different water treatment facilities in the metro area . It 's this one , just south of Cape Charles . How do you know ? Larkspur . I smelled it on him . The flowers are farm-harvested near the canal . They 're everywhere . All right . So Gunneson headed to this refinery after he made landfall . The question is , why ? Let 's grab Ramsey . If Gunneson 's there , we may need a translator . Hey , can I talk to you a sec ? Yeah . Uh , you know the blood spatter Lucas found in your bathroom ? The one that congealed into Ramsey 's fractal pattern ? Well , it wasn 't Gunneson 's . It was yours . But you said I didn 't have any cellular damage . You don 't . So why in God 's name would my blood do that ? That 's a good question . What happened to this man ? Apparently , he wasn 't too keen on the alien signal . It caused a sudden and catastrophic implosion throughout his entire body . See this thing that looks like a peach pit here ? That was his heart . Poor son of a bitch . How come this didn 't happen to all the crewmen ? I don 't know - something ... something unique in his DNA or ... He was found holding a cell phone . Maybe that was it . Maybe he was just standing in the wrong place . And the blood pattern I found on the bathroom floor , I understand it 's Caffrey 's . That 's right . How worried should we be about that ? You know , that 's a good question . And again , I don 't have the answer . When I find something ... you 'll be the first to know . That 's fair enough . Is there something else I can do for you ? I need your wallet . Are you mugging me ? Because I 'm a little busy right now . I want to check everyone 's organ donor status . We already have three members affected by the signal . No telling what might happen next . We can 't risk anyone from Threshold having their insides spread out among the general population . Can 't this wait ? I 'm afraid not . While we 're on the subject of invading my privacy , would you mind telling me who 's been censoring my e-mails ? Come again ? I sent two e-mails to my brother in Boston . From his responses , clearly , he hasn 't been getting everything I wrote . Then I suggest you write shorter letters . What 's that supposed to mean ? You mentioned you were working with Molly Caffrey , that you were involved with something classified - sensitive information , my friend . What are my rights here , exactly ? You have the full complement of rights guaranteed to every American . Mm-hmm . What if I decided to walk outside and go to the store ? Well , what do you need ? That 's not the point . Am I free to come and go as I please ? We 'll provide you with anything you need . All right . I need a tennis ball , some baby carrots , a number three pencil and a vintage Hohner harmonica 542 Golden Melody - with its original case . You 'll get a new license by the end of the day . Here , keep it . Don 't you need it ? I carry two . You gave me the girl gun . A revolver 's more reliable . It won 't jam like an automatic . When we have time , I 'll take you to the range . I shot Gunneson four times . It didn 't even slow him down . Yeah , well , after what happened on that ship , I had all our ordnance switched to explosives . Should cause a lot more damage . Right now , I want you to aim for the ten-spot , the heart . Okay ? If your aim was better , you might 've put him down for good . My aim was good enough to save your life . It 's not mine I 'm worried about . Afternoon , sir . Mind if we ask you a few questions ? Questions ? Yeah , we have reason to believe a suspect we 're investigating has taken refuge in there . Factory 's closed . Cavennaugh , come back . - Cavennaugh . - We 're aware of that . There 's no one here . All the same , we 'd like to take a look . Copy that . We 're getting warmer . Couple of the boys found a lifeboat from the Big Horn about a mile up the shoreline . Great . At least now we know he didn 't walk on water . So when was this facility shut down ? I don 't know . What did they manufacture here ? I don 't know . Do you know who was on duty last night ? No . Wow , do I feel safe with Ricky Retardo working the case here . Guys ! Over here . He was definitely here . This is from the boot print we lifted at my house . Gunneson 's . Look . The tread pattern 's an exact match . You 've got at least four other sets of prints here , as well . The other crewmembers . You don 't know that . Could 've been anyone . Different sizes , maybe , but they 're all the same pattern . I ran Gunneson 's impression through the database . It 's a WORX steel-toed boot made by Red Wing . Now , the Big Horn was a Naval freighter . These boots are standard issue . So we 're not just dealing with Gunneson anymore . At least four of them made it to shore . They definitely didn 't meet here by accident . They 're congregating . - Cavennaugh , come back . - Cavennaugh . We 're in the building just south of you . It looks like there 's some blood here . - We 're on our way . - Roger that . That 's disgusting . Isn 't it ? So the big guy in there used to be one of the roaches on the ship ? Mm-hmm . I 've been watching him mutate for the last 48 hours . Okay , check out what he does next . He 'll keep doing that all night long , over and over again . The fractal pattern ? Part of it , anyway . You really think we 're okay , Doc ... me and Dr. Caffrey and Cavennaugh ? Well , medically , yeah . I haven 't found anything to cause me worry - a few spikes in your theta-waves . Weird stuff , yeah , but not worry kind of stuff . That theta-wave business , that 's not something I can pass on to my fiancee , right ? Honestly , I have no idea . Why don 't you just keep your mitts off of her till we know what we 're doing here ? Didn 't you say you had some kind of theory about the signal ? Yeah . Let me show you . Whoa , whoa , whoa ! What do you think you 're doing ? It 's okay . There 's no audio on this tape . So ? So the audio 's what we need to be worried about . I ran the tape through a spectral frequency analysis . It 's what we do with the imaging data we get back from our deep space probes . The camera picks up more than the human eye can see , anyway . Here it is in infrared . Ultraviolet . As far as I can tell , the visual component is inert . It 's harmless . Just to be safe , I 'd like to explore this further with proper clinical trials . Okay . Fair enough . But here 's the point - I 've been dissecting the auditory components from the tape . And we struck gold . See , the signal 's miles deep . It 's made up of hundreds of different harmonics ... some of them are even beyond our technological ability to measure . That could be the hyperdimensional characteristics of our UFO , could be something else . But what we need to do is start pulling out and isolating the individual subsignals ... like this one . Or this one . And see how they affect your average living organism . Exactly . Might even tell us how our Average Joe Cockroach managed to Hulk out into Skeletor Roach over there . Wait a minute . Play that one back again . Loop it . Look at these guys ! The brown ones are getting awfully agitated . The brown ones are from the ship , right ? Yeah . And the white ones are our controls , but they 're not affected . Give yourself a gold star , Mr. Pegg . Do you have a key for this ? No . Shoot it . Get down ! Don 't move ! Stop ! This is Cavennaugh . I 've lost him . Make sure the area is secure . Whoa ! What in the hell ? Say hello to our real security guard . So that guy I was just chasing ... Yeah , hold on . It 's Sonntag . One of our missing crewmen . Son of a bitch shaved . - What ? - Where 's Ramsey ? Ramsey ? Ramsey . Hey , Ramsey . Ramsey . Ramsey ! - Ramsey ! - Ramsey ! You gave us quite a scare , Ramsey . Thought you might 've been kidnapped or something . " Otal ebay , orway otnay otayebay . " Come again ? " To be or not to be " in pig Latin . Very impressive . You finished going AWOL ? I 'm just saying , to " not be , " that 's a big deal . It 's not really my cup of tea . How 'd you find me ? We planted a tracking chip on you . Don 't worry , you won 't find it . It 's under your skin . You like playing Big Brother , don 't you ? Well , I 'm sorry to disappoint you , but , you know , ... I 'm outta here . Yeah , we figured as much . It 's okay , though . We got a replacement for you already lined up . It turns out you were actually number two on Caffrey 's list . Yeah , number one just became available . Oh , really ? Yeah , Andre Novakovitch . Novakovitch ? That little math bitch ? He 's all smoke and mirrors . Isomorphic group therapy . Monotonic null sequences . Quadratic reciprocity . Blah , blah , blabbety-blah . Come up with something new . Please . So , you want back in , then ? I can 't . When I saw that agent get shot right in front of me , I knew I was out . Hey , he 'll live . He was wearing a vest . You see a lot of guys die ? A few . You get used to that ? Unfortunately , yes . That 's what I 'm afraid of . Please ... Sah vaah norah whee . Sah vaah norah whee . You 're one of us . You 're one of us . - Molly ? - You 're one ... You all right ? Yeah , I was just , uh , going over this stuff . So how 's it going ? Trying to get inside Gunneson 's head . I read his file a dozen times , his service records . Even his high school transcripts . Sounds like you 're covering all the bases . But we can 't find him , and we came face-to-face today with another crewman and he got away , so ... I think I 'm running out of bases to cover , you know ? You knew this would happen , sooner or later . What , aliens ? Your contingency plans . Viral outbreaks , international monetary collapse . And , uh , what was the one you wrote in ' 97 ? Cataclysmic shift in the polar ice caps . Mmm . Sounding pretty good right about now . Reality scaring you a little ? Little more than a little . Look , I remember something that someone once said - " Focus on the task , not the fear of the task . " I can 't believe you remember that . You wrote a hell of a thesis . It was the only " A " I gave out that year . Maybe the author should keep her own words in mind . The brown ones are from the ship . Each of them shows signs of cellular mutation . The white ones , on the other hand , are a basic laboratory stock , and they 're unaffected by the signal . We 've been dissecting the audio signal from the videotape , experimenting with different harmonic components . And the one we 're about to play for you has produced some interesting results . Remember , this is only part of the signal - a sub-harmonic - not enough to cause harm to any of us . I 'll be damned . How many times have you run this test ? Dozens . And everytime it 's had the same result ? Mm-hmm . Do you think it could have the same effect on an infected human ? - Well ... - Whoa , whoa . Guys . Experimenting with rats in a controlled environment is one thing . We take this out in the open , we could be playing with fire . We already are . Listen , before they tested the atomic bomb , Edward Teller theorized the entire atmosphere may go up in flames . But they went ahead and tested it , anyway . Why ? Because there was a war going on . Who 's to say that 's not the case now ? Look , we 've already instituted a nationwide manhunt . We 're staking out all of the crewmen 's friend and family . So far , we 've come up with nothing . So we try something new . It wouldn 't be called risk management if there weren 't any risks involved . I say we make our own RangaTang lure . They 've got these little sonar lures . I use them when I fish peacock bass out at Lake Okeechobee . The lures beep imitate the croaking sounds of the bait fish . We can do the same thing with your signal here , see if we can 't snag Gunneson . Or see if we can 't snag all of them . Hey , you guys seen the van ? It 's pretty tricked out . It 's like top-of-the-line surveillance gear and cool night-vision scopes . Only the best for Threshold . Who makes this stuff , anyway ? So , are we sure about this little plan of yours ? I mean , aren 't we going to be in proximity of the signal ? It 's a sub-harmonic . We 'll be fine . All right . I just hope you know what you 're doing . Hey , Nigel ? Baylock said this is for you . For me ? Hmm . I always wondered what doctors carry in their little black bags . Dr. Fenway ? Just some ... supplies I requested . It 's been three hours . What do you think ? I think humans aren 't rats . Maybe we need more bait . Lucas ? Go ahead , Dr. Caffrey . Let 's amp the signal a little more . Are you sure about that ? - We don 't really know what effect ... - Just amp the signal . Okay . Stand by . - So , I heard you 're getting hitched . - That was the plan , anyway . Well , if you 're having second thoughts , you 've got the perfect excuse . - Which is what ? - Alien invasion , jackass . Why are you even still here ? Aren 't you supposed to be making your big getaway ? Oh , he chickened out . He couldn 't stand the thought of Novakovitch stealing his thunder . So you really don 't know where your father is ? Whether he 's dead or alive ? So what happened ? What 's the story ? You didn 't read my file ? I skimmed it . He disappeared when I was younger . Want me to try to find him ? Bet I could . If you 'd asked me that two days ago , I might 've said yes . Now , I don 't know . All the things I thought mattered to me ... Maybe they matter more . You got movement in Zone Three . Copy that . Zone Three . I 've got a visual . Stand by . - Negative , sir . It 's a dog . - It 's just a dog . - So , three times , huh ? - Down the aisle ? Yep . How 'd you keep working up the nerve ? Weren 't you worried each one was going to end up like the last one ? Unfortunately , it didn 't occur to me . Would you ever do it again ? Given our present circumstances , I suppose anything 's possible . I was worried you were going to talk me out of it . No , don 't worry , Lucas , because I really don 't care . You know , a cynic is an idealist with a broken heart . Thank you , Dr. Phil . Hey , Rhonda here just got her boobs done , and they garnered a very enthusiastic round of applause from the audience . Yay . Oh , sor ... sorry to interrupt your poignant moment there . Lucas , you there ? Yeah , go ahead . We 're not registering a signal from the transponder on the eastern perimeter . Can you take a look ? Yeah . On my way . Looks okay to me . Dr. Caffrey ? Hello ? We 're connected , you and I. Did you know that ? All of us are . We 're drawn to each other . We can 't help it . God created man in His image . This is no different . You want to scream for your friends ? Go ahead . Scream all you want . Scream ! Guys ... Hey , guys . Guys ! Help ! He 's here ! Help me ! Help ! Bad dream ? Sorry , no ... I 'm great . " Great " ? How do you define that adjective exactly , 'cause you certainly don 't look great to me . Hey , the situation 's getting to all of us ... some more than others . Listen , I 've got some great sedatives handy , if you want to take the edge off . I said I 'm fine ! Caffrey ! Caffrey ! It 's Gunneson ! He 's got Lucas ! He 's got Lucas ! Do you see now ? I had to come . We 're all connected . We 've acquired the target . He 's on the move . Remember , we need him alive . I 've got him in my sight . - He 's in Zone One . - Copy that . Zone One . He 's heading for us . I 've got him in my sight . Missed the target . What just happened ? Zone One , negative on the target . That 's a negative on the target . Repeat . It 's a negative on the target . Where is he ? Zone Three , negative on the target . We have nothing . No , nobody just falls of the radar like that . That 's exactly what happened to me last night . He disappeared . Molly , what are you doing ? He showed up at my house . He 's looking for me . No , Molly ... Gunneson ? ! It 's Molly ! I 'm right here ! I want to talk to you ! I 'm right here ! Gunneson ! You don 't want to shoot me . Don 't you understand ? You 're one of us . No . I 'm not . Now ! Move in ! I guess you just weren 't feeling the part about capturing a live specimen . - He 's alive . - ... ish . Now we know they 're vulnerable . We got him , that 's what important . Let 's get him back to Threshold and run every test we got . You doing all right ? Yeah . I 'm just wondering ... do you think he came here because of signal or because of us ? Maybe we were the bait . Just be glad only one of them showed up . Uh ... if we 're still broadcasting , you might want to ixnay on the signal . Stay down , remain calm , and no one will be hurt . I told you , I don 't know why I 'm here . I went out for a drive and I ended up in this place . I never go out for walks , especially at night . I don 't know why I came here , I don 't know why . Did you see anything unusual ? An object in the sky perhaps ? Either charge me with something or let me go ! Mirandize my ass , or I 'm walkin 'right now , pig ! Excuse me . - What 's your name ? - Paul . Why are you here , Paul ? Why did you come here ? I don 't know . Ever catch this many bass when you went fishing ? No . Man , let me go ! We got some righ ... Man , answer my questions , or someth ... So . Doctor Caffrey ... anything in those protocols of yours on how we 're going to spin this one ? We 're going to have to put all of these people into custody ? Not necessarily . We 've managed to work our way through about 60 of them so far . We 've done buccal-mucosal swabs , various blood panels . Based on the preliminary DNA sequencing that we 've been running , I 'm not detecting any cellular mutations . No triple-helix . I don 't think these people have been infected . Then what the hell are they doing here ? Well ... Well , look we were operating under the assumption that our signal fragment would only draw in our missing crew members , but obviously , it had some sort of effect on the ... the general population , as well . So far , all the people we interviewed came from within a five-kilometer radius , so it seems like the signal was localized . But there 's got to be tens of thousands of people living in that area . Why didn 't they all show up ? Why just these hundred and six ? Maybe the people who showed up share something in common , some kind of genetic predisposition . Then you need to find out what that is . You know , we dodged a bullet , here today . But we can 't let that happen again . Let 's make sure we have a clean bill of health on the rest of them . Done . Let 's go . So , what 's next in the Threshold playbook ? Well , I want to keep these people under surveillance . There 's not reason in detaining them at this point . Then I 'll see you back at Threshold later tonight . I 've got a date with Gunneson . What is up with this traffic ? Arlington 's never packed at this time . And Gunneson said what ? That they were recreating us in their image . How do you know it wasn 't just a regular nightmare ? Basic anxiety ? 'Cause I had the same dream you guys did last night . The one with the trees of of glass , and that thing ... that creature . - Why didn 't you say anything ? - Because I was scared . I still am . I mean ... I know Dr. Fenway said thatwe 're okay , but I just don 't feel like myself anymore . I know you guys know what I 'm talking about . I mean , your blood turned into the fractal pattern . What does that mean ? Doesn 't it bother you ? Just a little bit ? What 's happening is bad , really bad . I 'm not going to lie to you , Lucas . I 'm scared to , we 'd be insane not to be . we 're going to stick together ... and get through this . How can you say that , though ? You don 't know what we 're fighting . What 's the alternative ? Give up ? Pretend that this isn 't happening ? Is that going to make you feel safer ? Look at me . We have a plan ... and so far , it 's working . We got Gunneson , and we 're going to get the rest of them . Okay ? We just have to stick to the plan . Subbed by the " Red Team " Transcript : RaceMan Synchro : Travis Corrections : Seth Cohen

 Go ! Go ! My dogs , run ! The gate ! The gate ! The gate ! You ! You can run but you can 't hide ! You did a great job . Don 't go overboard now . Don 't touch , please . It 's a precision instrument . Don 't touch ! Tell me , son ... this machine of yours it can take two , can it ? Possibly . I 'm okay . Just get them organized . We 're moving out tonight . Okay , listen , everyone . We 're going out tonight . You all know what to do , just get on with it . Timbo , Derek ... Pappagallo 's been hurt . How 's the rig ? The rig . How is she ? Cracked timing case cover . It 's broken a couple of teeth off the timing gears . Got a cracked timing case cover . It 's broken a couple of teeth off the timing gear . The radiator 's damaged at the core . It 's got a cracked water pump . It 's got a fractured injector line . Well , what does all that mean ? Yeah , okay , but what does that mean ? - What does that mean ? - Twenty-four hours ! They got twelve ! You 've got twelve ! Listen , I was wrong about you and I 'm sorry . It 's a long time since I 've seen driving like that , man . You 're okay by me , son . With you driving that rig , we got it licked ! Nice to have you aboard . I 've been saving these . I want you to have them . Thank you , and welcome . It 's been a pleasure doing business with you , but I 'm leaving . You have defied me ! You will know the vengeance of The Lord Humungus ! I promise you nobody , nobody gets out of here alive ! Who 's supposed to be helping out with the drums ? Come on ! Come on with the drums , come on ! What 's wrong ? Come on . It just seems wrong sneaking away like this . But you said you wanted to come , sweetheart . I know I did . Look , you 're scared now . Come on , it 'll be much safer up there . What are we waiting for , eh ? This is my family . I 'm not going to leave these people . I 'm staying . I 'm sorry . Come on , I 'll show you ! I told you . He 's leaving . Look , I don 't have time for long speeches , I want you to drive the tanker . Sorry . We had a contract . I kept my part of the bargain . We 'll make a new contract . I 've got all I need here . You don 't have a future . I could offer you that . Rebuild our lives . Buy a ticket for 2,000 miles . You have to come , sonny . This is where we 're going . Paradise ! 2,000 miles from here . Fresh water , plenty of sunshine ... Nothing to do but breed . No thanks . What is it with you ? What are you looking for ? Come on , Max , everyone 's looking for something . You happy out there , are you ? Eh ? Wandering ... one day blurring into another ? You 're a scavenger , Max . You 're a maggot . Do you know that ? You 're living off the corpse of the old world . Tell me your story , Max . What burned you out , huh ? Kill one man too many ? See too many people die ? Lose some family ? Oh , so that 's it . You lost some family . That make you something special , does it ? Listen to me . Do you think you 're the only one that 's suffered ? We 've all been through it in here , but we haven 't given up . We 're still human beings with dignity . But you , you 're out there with the garbage . You 're nothing ! Get out , kid ! Go on , get out of here . Go on , get out . Scat ! Get out ! You 're letting him go ? Well , let 's keep his vehicle at least . He fulfilled his contract . He 's an honorable man . Okay , so who 's gonna drive the tanker ? I am . They 've got you wrong , you 're not a coward . Stupid , maybe , but not a coward . You 're making a serious mistake splitting a great team . You and me together , think of the possibilities . See you around , maybe . Good-bye , good luck . We go ! You disobey me ! You puppy ! Toadie , the gas ! Hurry up ! Don 't waste him ! If he 's alive I want him ! The tanks are full , O mighty Wez , and it 's all yours . It 's all over . Let 's go ! Look ! Out there . Oh , hell ! You blew it , you fool ! Relax , partner ! I 'll be driving the tanker . We 're going to crash or crash through . Now , at this point , that 's all they want : The tanker . So they 'll come straight after us . So we 'll use that to punch our way out which will give all of you a very , very good chance . Now , don 't hesitate ! Once you 're outside there , split up and go as hard as you can . Now , 200 miles to the north there 's a place with a bridge called Powder River . That 's our rendezvous . Give us till sunset . If we haven 't made it by then ... keep going . Good enough for me to build , but not to ride . You 're not coming on this tanker ! I sweated blood on this . No bastard 's gonna to tell me to ride in no lousy school bus ! - Okay , settle down ! If it 's all the same to you I 'll drive that tanker . The offer is closed . Too late for deals . No deals . I want to drive the truck . Why ? Why the big change of heart ? Believe me , I haven 't got a choice . And how do you think you 'll do it ? I mean , look at you . You couldn 't even drive a wheelchair ! You should look at yourself , Max . You 're a mess . Come on , cut the crap ! I 'm the best chance you 've got . Right , let 's get moving ! Move that kid ! Get rid of him ! Shit ! Go ! Go ! I 'm all right ! I 'm all right ! Come on ! Come on ! The tire ! Shoot the tire ! Boy ! Come on , jump ! We 've won ! It 's over , boy . Get the bullet ! Get the shell . And so began thejourney north ... to safety to our place in the sun . Among us we found a new leader : The man who came from the sky the Gyro Captain . And just as Pappagallo had planned we traveled far beyond the reach of men on machines . The juice , the precious juice , was hidden in the vehicles . As for me , I grew to manhood and in the fullness of time , I became the leader the Chief of the Great Northern Tribe . And the Road Warrior ? That was the last we ever saw of him . He lives now only in my memories . Subtitles conformed by SOFTITLER Synchro do wersji : Rapo

 I 'm going to ... ( LASER GUN FIRING ) It 's Jo 's . You know , my friend crashed into a mountainside and nobody around here seems to give a damn . Get him off the street before I have to . We just sold our souls to Lundahl . Ready or not , here it comes . ( INSTRUMENTS BEEPING ) JO : Dead on target . I 'm reading you perfectly , Saint John . Laser digital communication . According to Locke , it can sing , dance , juggle and walk the dog . But can it cook ? ( LAUGHS ) Hey ! Where 's the fire ? Put the pedal to the metal , fly-boy ! Never challenge a man who can burn rubber on a cloud . JO : " Burn rubber on a cloud ! " Where do you get that stuff ? SAINT JOHN : The same place you got , " Put the pedal to the metal . " ( JO LAUGHS ) Catch me if you can ! Ladies first doesn 't count in the air , so don 't expect any favors . JO : Remember that summer Uncle Dom took us up to the lake and you beat me in that swimming race ? SAINT JOHN : ( SCOFFS ) What about it ? JO : Ah , well , this is where I get even . Hang on to your hat . ( LASER GUN FIRING ) Looks like we 're not the only ones doing some testing . I 'm going to ... Saint John ? Jo ? Jo , come on . No kidding around . Jo , where are you ? Come in , Jo . ( LASER GUN FIRING ) ( EXCLAIMS ) Jo , come in . Damn it , Jo , come in . Oh , God ! Mayday , mayday . This is two-seven-kilo-bravo . Pilot down , approximately ten miles south east of Santa Mira . Please respond . Damn it ! ( GRUNTS ) Crash ... Jo crashed . Tracey , you can 't leave , not like this . Give me one good reason why I should stay , Daddy . Because I need you , honey . What for ? To cover for you ? Drive you home at night when the bar closes ? I came here to help you with the hospital , Daddy . Not to babysit . I 'll finish my caseload and then that 's it . ( SHUSHING ) Don 't you talk like that . I 'm not gonna let this happen again . Yes , you will , Daddy . And if I stay here , I 'll just pick up all the pieces like Mom did . Tracey , I ... Will you let me go ? I gotta go find Jo . Settle down there , son . Whoever this Jo is , I 'm sure he 's in much better shape than you are . She ! She crashed . Hasn 't anybody ... You 're the one who crashed , son . You can 't go bouncing around like that just yet , Mr. Hawke . You got a slight concussion . Would you hold still , please ? Will you listen to me ? A friend and I were flying , she crashed . She 's the one who needs a doctor . The nurse said you were mumbling about that all night . We figured you were just delirious . I 've been here all night ? You 've been unconscious since they brought you here yesterday . All night and you haven 't even looked for her ? I 've got to find her . Now hold on . You 're not in any shape to leave here . Forget it . I 'm going . Okay . I 'll drive , you point . I 'll start downloading the photos and shipping them through to the Company . Those close-ups of the South China Sea ought to make them happy . What 'd make me happy is a hot sauna and a nice cold beer . I 'll get on the blower to Jo and Saint John and tell them to get your office nice and toasty . Tell them to put a cold can on your desk . Good . Wolf to cubs . Wolf to cubs . Do you read ? Is anybody home ? Nobody there . Maybe that means that they 've already got the beer in the cooler . I don 't understand . You 're sure this was the place ? Yeah , I remember this area . The rocks , this pond . I couldn 't land . I saw her here . Mister , I hate to say it , but there 's nothing here . Look at it . No whirlybird , no pilot , no sign of a crash . I know what I saw . I know what happened . Somebody would have noticed a helicopter crash . Let me take you back to the hospital . No . I want to look around some more . ( SIGHS ) Look , mister , I think Doc Kensington should get another look at that head of yours . I don 't need a doctor . Where 's my plane ? ( SIGHS ) What do you think , Mr. Lundahl ? I think ... I think we 've got a loose end here , Baker . We 're going to have to tie it up . Now listen , the doc says you shouldn 't be walking around , much less flying . Look , Sheriff , I know what happened to my friend yesterday . If I have to be a one man search party , then that 's what I 'll be . What the hell ? LUNDAHL : Mr. Hawke ! Mr. Hawke , I keep a crew on hand to service my own planes . I thought I 'd let them earn their keep . Who are you ? My name is Martin Lundahl . I 'm very pleased to meet you . It appears as though your plane isn 't going to be ready to leave for two or three more days . Then let me use one of yours . I 'm afraid I can 't . All my planes are grounded . You know , my friend crashed into a mountainside and nobody around here seems to give a damn . Look , sonny , you come roaring in here yelling about a crash , get everybody and his dog looking for what ? Scrub brush and ghosts . You got a phone around here I can use ? Of course , we do . If you would go right through these doors and around to the right of the building . Did you see all the high-tech junk he 's got wired into this thing ? That guy 's no crop duster . I don 't care who or what he is . I just don 't want him nosing around right now . Is that clear ? Clear enough . ( EXHALES ) Pull up as tight as we can get on that fleet of ships . Okay , going into super-snoop mode . Mind if I use your phone ? Sure , go ahead . ( PHONE RINGING ) ( PHONE RINGING ) Company store . Mike . Listen , I need you to come . Jo 's chopper ... Mike ? Mike ? Saint John . Saint John . What happened ? We got cut off . He said he needed us to come . He and Jo might be in some kind of trouble . Give him five minutes . If he doesn 't call back , put a trace on it . The line 's dead . You got another phone I can use ? It won 't do any good . They 're putting new lines into the factory . They 've probably cut the cable again . Well , how long till they get it fixed ? Last time it took over a day . Sorry . Yeah . Thanks . Now listen , there 's no medical reason to get him back . Then find one ! He 's getting to be a problem . I think it 's a little late to worry about what Mr. Hawke 's gonna find out , isn 't it ? It 's never too late , Doctor . Get him off the street before I have to . Too bad about the girl , though . ( DOOR CLOSING ) ( INSTRUMENTS BEEPING ) Saint John 's call was too short to get a pinpoint on it , but I think we got a general area . Jo filed flight plans for an air-to-air test on that laser communications package . They 're out in the Santa Mira mountains . Well , let 's put the two together and hope that they come up with Saint John and Jo . Help you ? Yeah . I need to rent a car . I 'm afraid there 's not much I can do for you there . Like to try , but ... But right now , there 's nothing for rent . That 's right . I 'm plumb out of cars . Well , how about one to sell ? No , I 'm afraid I can 't help you there , either . You might try Ralph up the road a ways . You see , I already tried him and he suggested I come see you . I can 't help you . Sorry about that and all . Yeah , right . Hi . Hi . Are you all right ? I 've been worried about you . There 's nothing wrong with me , it 's my friend Jo . She 's laying out there hurt somewhere . Sheriff Duranti said ... I don 't care what he said . Look , Dr. Kensington . Tracey . Tracey . Look , right now all I need is a ride back up there . That 's all I 'm asking . I may have bumped my head , but I am not crazy . Okay , come on . Get in . Looks to me like the flight plan only crosses a couple of towns . The call had to either come from Crestridge or Santa Mira . Well , first one , and then the other . ( SIGHS ) There 's nothing . She was trapped . I saw her crash . Look , I 'm here to help you . Then tell me what the hell is going on around here . Helicopters just don 't disappear into thin air . What is it with this town anyway ? Hey , I don 't know . You know , I 'm a stranger here myself . I just came here to help my dad . Something metal hit this rock . ( EXHALES ) Jo 's chopper . Then where 's the wreck ? It 's Jo 's . Are you sure it 's hers ? Yeah . I have to contact some friends . Can you help me ? I can try . Pull over . What ? Just pull over , quick ! Hey , where are you going ? Slide over . ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ( GASPS ) What 's he trying to do ? Hey . The guy keeps pushing . I tell you , he 's gonna keep digging until he comes up with something . What are you suggesting , Hank ? Are you gonna shove a gun in his face and pull the trigger ? Well , I 'm not going to let him get to the state police . In 24 hours we 'd be dead in the water . Guaranteed . Boys ! Accidents happen . Or can be made to happen . Could be he 's a dead issue already , Doc . Just like the girl . The girl didn 't just happen . Lundahl pushed the wrong button on one of his toys . I suggest that you remember who gave a rummy doctor and this whole town a second chance . How many people are gonna get killed before we pay back Mr. Lundahl ? As many as it takes . We just sold our souls to Lundahl . I don 't see you passing up any of the benefits , Doctor . I 'd like to report an accident , Sheriff . Another helicopter crash ? SAINT JOHN : No . White sedan . Reckless driving . Went up like the Fourth of July . Almost killed the lady and me . Tracey ? I 'm all right , Daddy . Where 's Jo ? Daddy ? Well , that 's it . We 've done everything but cross-stitch a pattern over their flight plan . Not a sign . I 've got something . Huh ? Heading 207 . I can 't see a thing . That 's because it 's five feet underground . Check out your monitor . ( INSTRUMENTS BEEPING ) Looks like Jo 's . Is there any sign of ... LOCKE : Negative . Nobody 's there . Alive or otherwise . Yeah . Well , I think it 's time that we checked out Santa Mira . I don 't care . Lou , I 'm in the middle of the most important deal of my life . I don 't need any interruptions . Hawke got Baker up on the mountain road . The doc is folding on us . This whole cover up 's going to hell . In 24 hours , there 's not going to be anything to cover up except our bank accounts . So you can be another quarter of a billion dollars richer . Lou , you 're gonna get your share . Just hold up your end . Santa Mira . Population 471 as of last census . Current estimate 2,200 . Looks like a boom town to me . No , but it 's got one heck of a factory . Lundahl Industries Incorporated . Sole owner , Martin Lundahl . Bought an old paint factory and turned it into a chemical plant . Anything on Lundahl ? Man seems to be a model citizen . ( WHISTLES ) What is it ? LOCKE : SAM-7 s , air-to-air missiles , artillery , ranks of them , like a corn field . Like an ammo dump from World War III . Welcome to the lion 's den . Hey , you think maybe Jo and Saint John stumbled onto this ? Only one way to find out . You 're right . Okay , hold on . Going down . Okay . I think I 'll just go down , have a little tour of the factory . Mike , hold on . Keep in touch with this . She 's lucky I was able to hide her . She 's gonna be okay . Jo ? Saint John , hi . Hi , yourself . How are you feeling ? Oh , uh , stiff . At least I feel something , thanks to the doc here . Heck of a stunt , huh ? I still can 't figure out how I did it . We 've got to get you out of here . Can you get up ? She should be able to walk to the car . I think they 're testing some kind of weapon out there . My chopper got in the way . Here . What the hell does Lundahl make ? I don 't know . Some kind of guns , ammunition . Why would anybody around here go along with something like that ? The paint factory closed . People had no way of making a living . Lundahl offered us one . Not much of an offer if you ask me . You know , folks , it just ain 't polite to leave without saying goodbye . Gentlemen , we 're not simply talking about advanced firepower here . We 're talking about one of the most significant developments in ballistics since the Chinese invented gunpowder . We can actually customize the concentration of each of these explosive tips to meet any of your requirements . ( GUN COCKING ) I 'm sure you gentlemen can understand the critical factor that the quality of your ammunition will be in a combat situation . As you can see , accuracy is no problem . Neither is power . Our version of the M16 is not the only weapon that can utilize that kind of power . And when it comes to armor-piercing capabilities , gentlemen , nothing beats our Mark Seven . Which we like to call around here , our tank buster . LOCKE : What the ... Mike . Do you read me ? I believe I 've made my point . We can provide that ammunition in quantity immediately . Our mass-production facilities are , of course , state of the art . Gentlemen , I would like you to take a look at the catalog and please , if you wouldn 't mind , turn to page 12 where it says , " Laser-sighted automatic rifles . " Mr. Lundahl . Would you excuse me for a moment ? Locke , Mike . It 's Saint John and Jo , they 're here . Roger . What 's the plan ? MIKE : You can blow the front doors off this building in two minutes and we 'll try to make our getaway . ( EXHALES ) You should have stayed out of my business . Nice business . Production of illegal weapons . What 's the matter ? Don 't you people believe in free enterprise ? That was goodbye , folks . Hank ? Next , gentlemen , I would like to take you outside and give you a demonstration of our laser-sighted automatic rifle . We 'll look at our laser cannon . Which , by the way , is capable of taking out any type of aircraft . Would you uncover that and start it up for us , please ? We 'll let it warm up for a while before we take it outside . Heads up . Get down . ( SCREAMING ) It 's gonna blow . Get out there , come on . Get them out of here , I 'll cover you . You bet . Come on . Stop the truck ! Stop it . What the hell kind of a chopper is that ? Never mind that . Let 's get out of here before this whole place blows up . Damn . Not a very friendly bunch , are they ? Let 's give them some southern hospitality . What the ... I 'm losing power ! Everything 's out . I 'll have to switch to manual override . Come on . Come on . That 's the one . Back in business . Now let 's put this place out of business once and for all . Anybody for a taxi out of Santa Mira ? Hi . Hi . You about ready ? Mmm-hmm . You know , it 's funny . All the time I was in here , I thought they shot you down . You never gave up on me , did you ? How could I do that ? I didn 't finish teaching you to dog fight . I can still wax your tail , fly-boy . Hi . SAINT JOHN : Hi . Hi . Oh , thank you . You 're welcome . You two packed and ready to go ? Oh , no , no . I 'm staying . ( SIGHS ) I 'm gonna stay , too . I think there 's still a lot of good medicine I can learn from my old man . There 'll still be enough people left in Santa Mira to make a go of it ? Well , the town is a little empty , but if one person needs a doctor , that 's a reason to stay . Say , you two wouldn 't mind if we signed you off duty for the night , would you ? We 're starving . Why don 't we go out and celebrate ? Sounds good to me . I 'm hungry , too . Let 's go . Can you grab my bag ? Thanks .

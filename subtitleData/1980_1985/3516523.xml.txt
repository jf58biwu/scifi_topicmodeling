 25 fps MOSFILM Company First Creative Union present All by myself at last ... Ages have passed since ... But I still couldn 't help thinking of that flight . Our transport shuttle started from The International Space Police Station . And in a couple of minutes we got docked to the " Vaigach " patrol spaceship . The spaceship copilot Gleb Skleretzky . Spaceship doctor - Karl Zdenek . Tina , stop it ! Report to the United Nations Astrospace Agency ( UNAA ) Control Center Have entered the duties . Spaceship captain - Lazarev . The PC " Vaigach " main computer has entered the duty . Report accepted . Officer in charge Luis Rivera .

The object is called . There 's an object in our course . It won 't answer the call . Platan-shield on ! Platan-shield is on . Manual control on . Contact to the center . Contact established . What is up ? We are under attack ! An unknown ship has attacked us . My comp is going to send the details . - I 'm waiting for further instructions ! - Accepted . Attention to all the patrol spaceships of the sector 9 . Stay ready ! Space Police Base is calling Center ! We are watching an unknown object in our sector . The object won 't contact . What the f * ck ! Fire ! We are under attack ! We ... Attention ! Attention ! Attention ! In sector 4 , area 3 The unknown object has just destroyed the Space Police International Station . " Omega " tracker station is speaking , over ! The unknown object has been identified . It 's the " Antares " battle ship . She is heading into the Security Base sector . The Security Base is speaking . " Antares " is within the shooting distance . It is aiming at us . - Destroy the agressor ship ! - Accepted . The ship survival systems are normal , commander ! Tina is dead ... Attention ! News Break . Today around 12 p.m. an unknown ship opened fire at the " Vaigach " space police patrol ship . Later , at 8 p.m. the same unknown ship destroyed the space police base . All the people who were at the base died . At 12 a.m. the " Omega " tracker station identified the agressor spaceship . It turned out to be the " Antares " spaceship , property of the largest corporation " Meinhaus " . When the identified " Antares " spaceship appeared in the International Security Base sector she attempted to attack it . The Base executed the Center 's order and destroyed the hostile ship . And now we are listeneing to the comments of the director of the United Nations Astrospace Agency . The dramatic incident , that took place , has for one more time witnessed the indisputable fact , that the space piracy is inspired by actions of the private megacorporations . It is also determined by so far humanistic ways of anti-piracy fighting . Considering the information UNAA shall undertake all possible measures . This is all . Thank you for listening . And here is another mystery . An hour ago the richest man of our planet multibillionaire Henry Flint commited suicide . He was the president of the said " Meinhaus " company . And now we welcome you to the galaxy conference , where the intenational control committee may try to clear up the events , that excited the world . The four men in the armchairs are the Directors Board of the " Meinhaus " company . The uneasy man behind their backs is their lawyer . And these are the intenational control committee members . The lawyer of our firm will answer all the questions . Are you the lawyer of this company ? Yes , I am . Is there any connection between the suicide of your president and the dramatic events in space ? Is there any connection ? ! No , there is absolutely no connection ! But the " Antares " spaceship belongs to you ! Consequently , you can be considered guilty of the space police station destroying ! Three years ago the company declared the " Antares " spaceship lost in space ... As everyone can see now , she was captured by the pirates . The UNAA director has declared it earlier . What did Michelli and Cober do in your organization ? This is the company inside information and it shall not be opened . Are there any questions you would agree to answer ? Or , for that matter , are there any aspects of your company 's activity , which are subject to open discussion in mass media ? Fortunately , there is no such aspects . Or we 'd have had no other things to do but to answer your questions . At that the queer conference ended . The " Antares " crew is dead . With no witness alive it will be very hard to discover the mystery of the powerful " Meinhaus " corporation . Its representatives avoided the responsibility for the incident . We hope , the police will identify the persons responsible for the tragedy and they wiil be punished severely . The registry department was very kind to give us the pictures of the crew , that was aboard of the " Antares " spaceship as she went in her last flight , 5 years ago ... Doctor Cober , the chief of the expedition . Augusto Michelli - the biophysicist . Steve Wilkins - the copilot . Margerie Hume - the doctor and biologist . Lazarev ! Listen up , you guys . We found that " Antares " came from the Ignaranta system . The Center navigators say she could start either from the 5th or the 7th planet . The 7th planet has got an atmosphere . The Center strongly recommends to investigate the planet number 7 . Download the navigation data into our comp . The course - the 7th planet of the Ignaranta system . Rivera ! Send us the information about the " Antares " crew as well . OK . So they think the whole Antares crew is dead . Augusto Michelli , and Douglas Cober I knew them very well . Version of the scientists-pirates is a tall story . Cober and Michelli are prominent scientists . Sure , they 've got nothing to do with it . Who could do this then ? To tell the truth I 've got no idea . I just don 't understand . The mankind acumulated the resources to develop the little planet and now this ! - Check the communication ! - Accepted ! - Check the modules ! - Yes , sir ! Comp , show the photographies ! Pause ! Margerie Hume - the doctor and biologist . Space pirates ... Space pirates are to be blamed but it was the president to shoot himself ? ! It is not logic ... 6 years ago Meinhaus sent 3 " Antares " spaceships to the Bambar star systems for the search of the energy agents . 2 are back to Earth . And the third one found herself in the Ignaranta system by some reason . They flew to the one sector of the space and came to quite the opposite one . Why ? This is the question we should answer ... Damn ! I got a feeling that we are being heard over ... I just didn 't pay attention to Gleb 's words at the moment ... It was a mistake ... I wish we had known what was going on down there ... And as we came to know much later , quite funny things took place there . Good evening , Marge . Hello , Dug . - You look fine . - Quiet ! Or you 'll wake up the kids ... How are they ? Fine , thanks . Sometimes I 'm sorry that I 'm not their farther . I got the news . Someone will need your mind , beauty , charm very soon ... - Someone who ? You ? - We . We are going to have some visitors . - What will I have to do ? - Nothing so far . I love doing nothing . Be ready . - Quiet , you 'll wake up the kids ! - Kiss them for me when they get up . Steve ! Steve ! What is up with you ? Enjoying your loneliness , aren 't you ? Or do you hide from me ? - Do I ? - Yeah , you do . What is it in your hands , Steve ? Nothing ... Are you cheating me ? This can end very bad ... You 'll kill me , won 't you ? It 's a joke ... A bad one , Dug ! The spaceship is coming , Steve . How did they find us ? They brought down Michelli . Did they ? ! Our plan was fine . The patrol spaceship is in her way to us . This is what we want ! Get ready to welcome our guests . " Vaigach " is much more cooler battleship than the old " Antares " ... No weapon can penetrate her platan-shields . That is why we need the spaceship so badly . The spaceship is on the orbit . Apocenter height is 560 kilometers Pericenter height is 516 kilometers Orbital period is 101 minutes Axial inclination is 54.3 grades Nothing . There 's nobody here . And why did they think back in the Center that " Antares " started from the 7th planet ? They just supposed . We should check both alternatives , though . I trusted our comp entirerly But I wasn 't sure still ... I chose to send Gleb for reconnaissance . Did I risk his life ? I should say , I did . It 's time , Gleb . Ready , commander ! Get the first module ready . Launch the beacon to the orbit ! What does it look like down there ? You were right , Sergei . Wastelands everywhere . But still , what does it look like ? Like a post-nuclear war desert . Yeah ... Creepy sight .. Gleb ? Gleb , I can 't hear you ! I can 't hear you ! Gleb , what 's wrong with communication ? Why are you silent ? Any problems ? Gleb ! I can 't hear you ! I can 't hear you ! Comp ! Locate the transport module . Our signals won 't come through . Get the search drones ready ! He may be in a canyon and the rocks may baffle our signal . Shit ! Everything is possible on such a planet like this one . Steve , turn on the mayday signal in the module . Let them fly to rescue him . Marge ! Doesn 't Steve 's behaviour seem funny to you ? No , why ? No ! I can 't remember . I forgot ... So , did you like him ? I didn 't see his face . Put the mask off him and you 'll see . The air here is no worse than that of the Earth . I 'm somewhat scared . Marge , you haven 't seen people for too long . Never mind , you got to get used to them again ... Don 't kill him , Dug ! - Have you turned the mayday signal on ? - No , I haven 't . I forgot ... - I haven 't had enough time ... - What have you been doing there ? I ... I ... You 're lying , Steve ! You 're lying me again ! Take this . What is it ? The key . - What from ? - I don 't know ... But when I look at it , I can hear music ... What the f * cking music ? ! Never mind , Dug ... No ! You 've forgotten , on Earth there are hundreds of people who can sell the most precious things for trifles ... It 's cruel , Dug . Go to your place . Wait for me there . I don 't want , Dug . Do you hear ? I don 't want ! Marge , Can you sew him up for one more time ? You 've made up your mind to kill him , haven 't you ? In our business you should destroy the man to make him live . To beat all these santiments out of him ... How much time do you need ? - Half an hour . - Go and get ready . Gleb ! This is Gleb ! Sklerezky ? Sklerezky , I can hear you . - Where are you going ? ! - Gleb is there ! Sklerezky , hold on ! Karel , even if you find Adam and Eve there ... don 't risk for nothing , or you 'll kill yourself and Gleb . Comp , get the second module ready ! Well , come on ... Kill ! Do ! But do it well ! I don 't want to live ! Any pulse ? There 's some , but it is weak . We 'll have to manage a more complicated operation soon . You 'll have to go to " Vaigach " . How can I ? The friends of that guy outside will come soon to fetch him . If you happen to be nearby , they 'll take you along . Why me ? Because ... you have magic hands , Doctor Hume . Who will look after the kids ? Steve will . You 're making a baby-sitter for the moment . Do you understand that we can do nothing against their shield ? I agree , Dug . The pulse is normal . Great . He will come to himself soon . Marge , when you get in " Vaigach " , disable their platan shields for thirty minutes at least . I 'll do the rest . My congratulations , Steve ! You 've got a strong heart . - How are you ? - Fine . What has happened to me ? - Nothing serious . - You were under the landslide . Where 's your key ? Key ? What key ? The small one . The one you can hear music from . Are you pulling my leg , Dug ? Great . Put on your clothers . I 'll see Marge off , she is flying to " Vaigach " . It 's genuine , Duglas . - You 've got time before the dawn . - Can they stop me ? - They 'll make your kids orphans , then . - I see . I 'll do everything . I 'll stay here . And you go to the module from the rocks . - Good bye , Dug . - See you later , Marge . Marge ! I can see the module . give me the screenshot of it . On its way . - Commander , I can see Gleb ! - So can I. They are to notice Marge soon . Then the second part of the plan will start . They 'll call the Center . But it 'll be us , who will tell them what to report . Gleb ! Gleb ! Are you alright ? ! How did you ... Zdenek and Skleretzky , get back in the module , now ! Look ! What 's there ? What 's up ? Commander , Margerie Hume is there ! - Who ? - Margerie Hume ! Everyone get back in the module , now ! How are Marge 's kids ? - Haven 't they got on you ? - They are sound asleep . I wish all kids were like them ! I 'd never believe Marge to become such a devoted mother . Commander , I don 't recall everything clear . I recall leaving the module ... Then I saw ... No . First , I heard some music ... And only then I saw the road . This is all . - How about her ? - Margerie Hume ? I saw her at the same time Karel did . She was lying near the module . - How 's she ? - She got a shock . A strong shock . So we guessed right about the planet . But who turned on the mayday signal ? I didn 't . Though ... No , I can 't recall ... Was there anyone else nearby ? I landed at the daylight . But when I came to myself ... It was somewhat dark ... Everything had a violet light on it ... - When will miss Hume come to herself ? - It 's a slow process . Comp , call back all the drones and beacons . Connect to the Center . Mysteries are everywhere . Gleb got amnesia . Margerie Hume has been found alone on the deserted planet . I should have given her a second thought , but instead I was wondering what funny clothers our visitor got on ... And I rushed to report to the Center . It was almost a disaster . " Vaigach " calls Center ! Rivera , can you hear me ? I got Margerie Hume aboard . She 's the doctor from " Antares " . Understood , " Vaigach " . Go on looking around the system . Go on , we are waiting for your results . Gleb , the main generator 's killed . Launch the emergency generator . Skleretzky , have you heard the orders ? ! It 's her ! Zdenek , lock her up ! Platan-shields power unit is off . Power unit is off , shields are off . Commander ! We should land ! We should land the spaceship . Crew members orders aren 't logic . Crew is higly loaded . Where are you going ? Karel ! Come up . He 'll kill us ! Be resonable ! You 'll kill us ! You must land on the planet ! - Land the spaceship ! - D 'you want me to land the spaceship ? I do . Platan-shields power unit is off . Karel , help me ! Shields are on . It was Margerie Hume , who exploded the platan system . There 's nobody else to do it . But it was not her we fight with . The unknown strange will was overtaking us . But whose will was that ? I didn 't know the answer back then . Yet , I got a version . But a scaring one to believe . I know nothing ! I do ! Please , let me go ! I got kids . They 'll die if I don 't come back to them . Oh , God ... Why do you all keep silence ? Say something ! Alright . We 'll help you .. Will you ? Just tell how did you ... Call us when she awakes . Come on . Still , nothing terrible happened , Steve . This is force-majoure . We 'll make out Plan B , that 's all . But now they 'll understand , that Marge is not alone here . We should have captured the two ones who landed . Steve , We 'll have enough time to capture hostages , - We need the spaceship ! - What about Marge ? Don 't worry about her . Her mission is not over yet . We 'll bring her back out of there afterwards . The main thing is that we are in control of the contact between " Vaigach " and the Center . Understood , Lazarev . Be careful and go on investigating the planet . We are waiting for results from you . What the hell ? ! Haven 't they got our report ? Have they all gone to bananas there ? Looks so . Well , let 's listen to the real Center message . Sergei , I can 't hear you ! If you can hear me , leave the planet now ! The search groups are on their way to you . F * ck ! The search groups . It 's for serious . Professor Augusto Michelli went in for the theoretical biophysics . He suggested his ideas and prototypes to many institutes , but didn 't succeed . Meinhaus coproration gave him the job , in the medical biological research institute , where his career boomed . Later he invited biophysic Duglas Cober , engineering biophysic Steve Wilkins , doctor and biologist Margerie Hume to work in his lab . Comp , what are the odds that they developed the project , Michelli failed to introduce ? No information about their co-project . Operational hints : leave the orbit of the planet . You told you knew them . I did . Augusto Michelli is a hard guy . Either his way or nobody 's . He and Duglas Cober both liked hard complicated problems . Each of them is a gifted scientist , but they were genuine when teamed together . They couldn 't leave the woman behind and fly to Earth to kill and destroy . Could they programm Anteres for the flight and stay here ? D 'you belive scientists can programm the comp to kill ? Ask the Center for more information , then . What new can they tell us ? ! Center ! Your instructions contradict to those of the comp . I operate on my own . Reinstall the OS . We must help the survivors if there are any on the planet . I don 't get it . Just don 't . And I 've just got . I believe the comp is right and Rivera is not . Come , Steve . " Vaigach " ! Leave the orbit now ! We managed to shield Vaigach from the Center 's signal . Yeah , but there 'll be no fun , with all those search groups after our asses . Marge , girl , give a note ! Are Marge Hume 's kids there on the deserted planet ? Craps . - Look , may be she ... - Wait , Gleb ! It 's no crap . And no lie . At that moment I made up my mind for a desperate move ... What if we just ... let her go ? Why ? We 'll follow her secretly . Let me go , please . My kids are there ! They can die ... I 've told you we 'd help , miss Hume . - How are you ? - Fine . We 'll bring you back to the planet . We 'll see you off . If you 'd like to warn somebody of your coming , I 'll let you use our radio . There 's no one there . Just my kids . I trust you . Zdenek ! Show miss Hume her cabin . She has to have a rest before leaving . Thanks . What are you doing ! She is a liar ! This is not the point . The point is we don 't know how and what she exploded the platan system with . We don 't know what is going on on the planet . We don 't know what is going on aboard our ship . But we have to ! And we have to predict the events ! - Commander Lazarev , you 're under stress . - I know ... Look , Gleb ! D 'you recall the first two expeditons to the Giads star system ? The first one never came back . The people died . What about the second ? They reported they had found the kappa-radiation that had killed the first expedition . Go on ! Then academician Orlov invented the kappa-radiation shield . It was called after him . Why do you ask ? You 'll accompany Margerie Hume to the planet , that 's why you 'll need the Orlov shield . Comp , what is Orlov effect duration ? Orlov effect duration is 3 hours . - For non-organic creatures ? - Effect is not fully studied yet . You 've got to have a bit of rest . I 'm not tired . I got an omen . I 'm scared . Are you the one to see me off ? - If you feel like that ... - I do . I 'd like you to be that person . Listen up . If you answer my question " What 's new ? " " Nothing so far " it means the shield is OK . If you feel the effect to cease , humm a song . I see . Well . I 'll be driving you module from here . You doubted , didn 't you . Karel , what 's new ? Nothing so far . It 's time . Wait here . Karel , can you hear me ? I can . Marge ! Don 't worry about me . Glad to see you , Marge . Glad to see you , too . Meet my collegue ... We 've met before . You 've mistaken . This way ... - I worried greatly about the kids . Are they OK ? - Steve turned out to be a good baby-sitter . This is our home . Here everyone can get everything he or she may want . Be our guest . Have you got any wishes ? Come on . I 've got no wishes . I don 't believe you . Don 't you want to report to your commander ? Karel , what 's new ? Why don 't you answer ? You do have a lot of things to tell . Nothing so far . Listen , what they heard in the spaceship : Sergei ! Gleb ! I 'm waiting for you ! I 've met our friends here . Karel has contacted ! Why have they been hiding from us so far , I wonder . - I wonder the other thing . - What exactly ? His voice sounds funny . D 'you recall the talk with the Center and the stupid recommendations they gave us ? - You think it 's a frame-up ? - Yes . There was no connection with the Center . I understood everything at the moment . It gave me creeples just to think what was going on on the planet ... We had got to rescue Karel . We hadn 't enough time to work out the precise rescue plan . - Ready ! - No , I shall go . And you shall leave the orbit and go to the system fringe . The connection to the Center may be better there . Karel 's protection is to cease within 2 hours . I know . Start maneauvring the moment I leave the spaceship . I 'll stay in contact . But in case ... . Don 't you think about that ! Your hands . We 've got to do this . Don 't you feel like sharing something with us ? The platan shields system principle , may be ? I don 't understand what you mean . Don 't you ? Perhaps , Marge will be smarter than you ? She doesn 't know anything . But you do ! So , you don 't want it the good way ? Steve , have an eye at him ! Damn . Wait for the order to maneauvre . Commander 's order shall be confirmed by crew member left in charge . Wait , give me a couple of seconds . - Why have we lost the contact with Commander ? - Line interference . Analyzing ... Marge ! Marge ! Marge , you 've been in the spaceship already . - Quiet , please ! - You must know everything about the shields . You have been told to discover that . Marge , honey ! You 're a smart girl ! Please ! - For the sake of our common past ! - I remember nothing ! In love , are you ? ! Marge ! He shall die if you don 't remember ! I swear , I know nothing ! I swear by my kids ! I won 't kill you . I can 't remember . I can 't . Steve , leave him . Go welcome our guests . Here , stay where you are , mister Zdenek . He isn 't here , Marge . Come back and trim youself I wouldn 't like our guests to see you the way you look now . Afternoon , Mr. Captain . Hello , Mr. Wilkins . Doctor Duglas Cober is awaiting you . Boy , what an outfit ? ! Who made you look like an ancient Egyptian ? Feel yourself at home . Wow ... What a queer design ! ? Glad to see you , Captain ! Duglas ! I know what you want to ask me about . I 'd like to know where 's Karl Zdenek , and is he OK for the first thing ? Are you satisfied ? Can he hear us ? You 'll meet with him later . Could I help you ? The cop wants to help the criminal ? D 'you believe you 're the one ? Enough ! The new order era has dawned ! We 'll build it ! That is what we 're here for . Augusto Michelli brought you here . Your coming has been planned long before the present . You 'll learn everything . No , I 'm not mad . Get rid of the thought . I can read your thoughts ! Do you know why did " Meinhaus " president commit suicide ? Sure , I do . He was a coward . He was the only man who knew what we worked on . On what ? Don 't hurry . Did your research kill doctor Michelli ? Yes . He sacrified his life To make you come . We need a patrol spaceship . I know your answer to this from the start , so I warn you : All the people , including you , shall obey us sooner or later ! Are you so sure ? OK . Tell me what should I do ? Be my partner . You kill the shields and we 'll bring you to Earth . If I don 't ... We 'll find the way to do it , but I wouldn 't give a penny to your life . You got 2 hours to think it over . time is out . The order isn 't approved yet . You heartless iron box ! What you know about friendship ! " Friendship " - means deep mutial understanding and trust . It does ! How can I leave my friends - Sergei , Karel - behind ? ! Spaceship captain order must be approved . - Have you heard my proposal ? - I have , but I don 't like it . Tell me why don 't you obey my orders or I 'll kill Margerie ! Follow me and you 'll see yourself . Kappa-radiation ! Damn ! Orlov effect is quick to cease ! Don 't lag behind ! Move up ! If he keeps silent , I 'll kill your kids . You see ? No ! NO ! NO ! I warned you ! How can you avoid my control ? Time ? Damn , but of course ! Orlov effect ! I should have guessed earlier ! Marge , calm down . I 'm not going to kill your kids . Now we 're waiting for the captain . In 2 hours they 'll invite us to " Vaigach " , they will . Shut up ! I 've heard your crap about the approval for dozen times . The communication is interfered . The planet orbit should be left . How can we help the crew ? I got the only chance - to make Steve remember the past , his wife , his daughter , all his past life . It was our only chance for rescue . Where did you get it ? I guess , it belongs to your doctor . It 's not his . The doctor got the pet . a monkey tina by name , - she used to play . When Augusto Michelli attacked our spaceship , she died . Augusto ? Attacked ? Crap . At that moment I understood EVERYTHING . All these people were subdued to the evil will , that wanted to overtake us ... Wilkins was our only hope . Daddy , don 't go ! Mom will cry . She says you won 't ñome back ! I remember everything ! Sergei ... Lazarev ... Go ! Hurry ! I 'll delay him ! Then I knew where to go and what to do . Where 's he ? Don 't stop him , Dug . Don 't stop . I remembered everything . We are the slaves of TUPOS . Where 's he ? ! Boy , this is our old pal Lazarev ! - Where 's he ? - You won 't go further ! Even Marge will fail to help you . Mister Captain , where are you ? Your Orlov effect will expire in a couple of minutes ! Come back and let 's have a talk like gentlemen . What else can protect from kappa-radiation except Orlov effect ? Sy-energy . What the f * ucking energy d 'you mean ? Donor . You must have source of sy-energy . Only sy-energy can penetrate all artificial interferences . Danger ! Such dose of sy-energy can cause donor 's dearth . Why haven 't you told about this , you stupid iron box ? I have been processing loads of information . You can be donor . But first you must approve Commander 's last order . I 'm ready , launch the programm ! Leave the orbit in 15 minutes . Contact with Center is stable . Good bye , spaceship ! We 've had great time together . Good bye , you , brainless machine . Sy-energy transfer cabin ready . Start countdown ... Sergei , Gleb 's speaking . Over ! Sergei , can you hear me ? It 's Gleb ! Vaigach has left the orbit . Can you hear ? Contact with Center established . Sergei ! Answer me ! We 've met at last . So , that is what you look like ... TUPOS . Artificial intellect , who was created by the man and enslaved it 's own creator ! How many victims have you killed ? ! How many are you to kill in future ? I shall stop it ! Steve ! Steve ? Are you alright ? Steve ! It wasn 't me ! It wasn 't me , I 'm sorry ! I 'm so sorry ... Where am I ? What is up with me ? Steve ? Augusto ? Karl ! We must find Cober and Wilkins , now ! Gentlemen , you don 't have to look for me or Steve . Steve is dead . Duglas ! Why are you silent ? Sergei , leave the place , now ! - The whole place will soon blast ! - We 'll take you with us . Nobody can stop the bomb . It has been launched by default when you deleted TUPOS . Move ! Marge will show you the way out . Dug , enough of senseless victims ! I know what you 'll say . I 'm innocent . I will by justified by any jury ... Will the jury absolve me my sins ? - What sins ? - I murdered Michelli and Steve . TUPOS ? But we are his creators ! We 've created it ! Of course we didn 't mean to kill people , we meant to help them . I never doubted it . - You are a scientist ! - I am ... I should have thought of consequences ! I was crazy about my ideas .. I didn 't notice the moment the experiment was turned the other way . - Is " Mainhaus " president was resposible for that ? - You 're right . He ordered to change the software a bit . The changes were minimal and I agreed . Afterwards it was already late ... President dreamed of his own army . that could obey him without hesitation and TUPOS could heop him . But the AI gained the personality and did its own way . Thus we became its slaves . Obedient murderers and killers . Michelli was the first . The others followed his gloomy path . Dug , everything is over . We wait for you . Thanks , Sergei , don 't . Marge ! Forgive me ! I was too weak to save you from it . There are no kids and have never been . There 's past without future . Go away ! You 've got several minutes . # You 're my Earth , # I feel your warmth # with my heart # When I 'm blue # I 'll be back from the fartherst travels . # And I 'll hug you , # My Earth ! # my Earth , # Yours are # the love and the beauty . # My Earth , # your kindness # will be my life long support # You are my Earth , # There 's nothing more to add . # I owe you every thing I have . # I 'm happy to breath your fresh air , # to look into your eyes . # My Earth ! # Yours are # the love and the beauty ...

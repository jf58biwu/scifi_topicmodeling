 MAN : Get Cleopatra ! Those barbarians want me dead . Can 't this car go any faster ? I lost her . You lost Cleopatra in New York City ? ( ALL CHEERING ) Babe Ruth 's the greatest player baseball ever knew . Maybe I 'm finished . Just keep him busy tonight . He 's already inside . Why would Lucky Luciano want to kidnap Babe Ruth ? ( CHATTERING ) Hey , Mr. Ruth , you wasn 't gonna leave without saying good night , was you ? BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! MAN : Caesar 's been killed ! He was assassinated on the Senate floor . Find me Caesar 's woman so she can share his fate . A gold coin to the man who finds her . ( PLUMMETING ) Search for her ! It 's better than a haystack . Yeah . BOGG : Wow . Bogg , the Omni . ( BEEPING ) Roll . You won 't take me without a fight . Bogg , look out ! Get away ! Get away from me . I will not be led away calmly like some sheep to slaughter ! Look , lady , we 're not here to hurt you . He 's telling you the truth . I can 't trust anyone . They 've killed Julius . Julius Caesar ? Yes . Bat 's breath ! We 're too late . Wait , what 's the date ? ( BEEPING ) 44 B.C. Is it the Ides of March ? Yes . Oh , Julius loved holidays . He got to ride in his chariot and make speeches to the senators . Bogg , Julius Caesar died in 44 B.C. On the Ides of March . He was murdered on the Senate floor . You sure ? Yeah , I 'm sure . ( BEEPING ) Then why 's the Omni red ? MAN : Get Cleopatra ! Kill the Egyptian princess ! Those barbarians want me dead . Cleopatra ? Yes ? The Cleopatra ? There couldn 't be more than one , kid . Not with a face that beautiful . Well , then , that 's it , Bogg ! Cleopatra didn 't die with Caesar . She escaped from Rome and went to Egypt . ( CHATTERING ) I loathe Egypt . It 's hot and it 's dusty . MAN : Kill the Egyptian princess ! But I have always loved sailing on the Nile . BOGG : Good . Here , put this on . But this is a slave 's robe . I wouldn 't be caught dead wearing this . You may be dead if you don 't . Come on . ( BANGING ) MAN : Cleopatra ! We know you 're in there . BRUTUS : It 'll be easier if you surrender . Kid , get ready . Oh , Brutus ! I 'm out here . There ! Get them ! Come on , kid , let 's go . Go on , kid . Don 't let them get away ! Please , not Julius ! ( GROANS ) Help me ! MAN : She 's in there ! Come on . What do we do ? There . CLEOPATRA : There what ? BOGG : Go on . I 'm not going to jump . Oh , yes , you are ! ( SCREAMS ) Help me ! Now . No ! MAN : Get her ! After them ! She 's gotten away ! Search the city , scour the countryside . She mustn 't escape ! BOGG : Okay , kid , let 's go . This is hardly the style in which I 'm accustomed to traveling . We just saved your life . A simple " thank you " would be nice . You expect gratitude ? To most men , it would be considered a privilege to protect my life . Well , I guess we 're not like most men . Come on , Jeff . You 're not leaving me here in the middle of nowhere ? You 're safe . The coast is just beyond the hill . As the queen of Egypt , I command you to stay . Sorry , I 'm a citizen of the world , free to come and go as I choose . Please . Please , don 't leave me . Much as I 'd like to stay , duty calls . Have you never heard of Queen Cleopatra ? It is said that I have cast magical spells of love over men stronger than even you . Yeah , I 've heard . And I always hoped that I 'd bump into you someday . Bogg . But I really gotta go . Oh , boy . Come on , let 's wrap this up . Bogg ? Bogg ! ( PLUMMETING ) What a kiss ! ( BEEPING ) All men promise their kiss will cause the Earth to tremble , but ... I thought we 'd drop in to say hi . ... your kiss , it really made the Earth move . It 's not my kiss . Then what caused this magic ? We gotta get out of here . Come on . It 's a wonderful chariot . Yeah . Where are we ? CLEOPATRA : What is this wonderful place ? BOGG : It 's not Rome , 44 B.C. I can see that ! Get going back . Atlantis . This must be the lost continent of Atlantis ! ( HORN TOOTING ) Such big chariots . How did we travel here ? It was a mistake . You 're not supposed to be here . I was born to the throne of Egypt . Certainly a place so rich and exotic as this is exactly where I belong . Good afternoon , honey . You belong back on your throne in Egypt . I 'd rather be queen of this magnificent land . ( WHISTLING ) There 's nothing for me back there . Jeffrey is back there . Then you go back and get him . I 'm taking you with me . Now , what 's the harm in my looking around this great , glorious land ? I 'm in no danger here . MAN : Lucky Lindy 's landed ! ( ALL CHEERING ) ( CLAMORING ) Cleopatra ? I can 't believe he made it ! Bat 's breath . Hey . Bogg ! What took you so long ? I had a little problem . Where 's Cleopatra ? I lost her . You what ? I lost her . What year ? You ever hear of Lucky Lindy ? Charles Lindberg ? Yeah . Well , he just landed in France . 1927 . ( BEEPING ) Where ? I think I see something . There , in the trees ! You lost Cleopatra in New York City ? Maybe I should 've stayed there and looked for her instead of coming back for you , huh ? No , Bogg , you did the right thing . You there ! Stop in the name of the Roman Empire . Look for them . They 're gone . Where could they go ? Bogg , I lived here all my life , and believe me , it 's a big city . Don 't worry . We 'll find her . Where do we look first ? You 're the one from New York . Yeah , New York , 1982 , not 1927 . She 's probably trying to find us by now . Get serious . She hasn 't got a penny . She 'd be easy to spot , with that beautiful long black hair . And she 's running around town in that silly-Iooking outfit . In fact , she 's probably cold , hungry and alone . Hey , you alone , toots ? Toots ? I hope you forgive me for being so forward , huh ? But you are one good-Iooking doll . You 're forgiven , Mr ... Luciano . I know every beautiful girl in this city . How come we never met before , huh ? Well , actually , I just arrived . Oh , you 're new in town , huh , toots ? So , where you from ? Most recently , Rome . Hey , I 'm from Sicily . ( SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) JEFFREY : Bogg , we 've been searching for hours . We 're never gonna find her . Well , we can 't give up now . ( BELL RINGS ) Hey , Bogg , Yankee Stadium 's just up here . Come on . Yeah ? What 's a Yankee Stadium ? It 's like the Colosseum . You think she might be there ? You ever had a hot dog before , Bogg ? I used to have them all the time with the works . Relish , mustard ... Bogg , this is all wrong ! What else could be wrong ? It 's gotta be around here somewhere . What are you talking about ? The stadium , Yankee Stadium . Maybe we 're on the wrong street . No , it should be right over there . They probably moved it . Bogg , you can 't just move something that big . I lost a woman . You lost a whole building . Oh , come on , Jeff , we 're supposed to be looking for Cleopatra , not a stadium . " Yankees still in cellar . Lose six-to-one at Polo . " That 'll be a nickel , kid . Mister , do the Yankees still play at the Polo Grounds ? Only when they ain 't playing at Carnegie Hall . What about Yankee Stadium ? The Yankees gotta start winning some games before anybody builds them their own stadium . Why aren 't they winning ? What about Murderers ' Row ? What about Ruth ? Ruth ? Ruth who ? Babe Ruth . Nobody named Ruth ever played for the New York Yankees . JEFFREY : His real name was George Herman Ruth , but everybody called him Babe . Babe Ruth . Oh , I think I saw him pitch once , in 1922 , when the Red Sox were in town . Babe Ruth was still pitching in 1922 ? Yeah . And he 's not with the Yankees ? Kid , I already told you . Never was . He retired a couple of years ago . I think he went into vaudeville , and then just sort of disappeared . Thanks . Come on . The Omni . Is it still red ? ( BEEPING ) Well , yeah . What do you expect with Cleopatra running around loose ? No ! It 's not her . It 's Babe Ruth . Now we 've got to go to the Red Sox 1919 spring training . Hey , look , kid , we got Cleopatra 2,000 years out of time . I think that 's a little bit more important . Yankee Stadium is called " the house that Ruth built . " Without him , it never would 've existed . We 're not exactly talking about the pyramids or the Great Wall of China . Bogg , baseball just wouldn 't be baseball without Babe Ruth . Jeffrey , no . You know , Bogg , as a Yankee , Babe Ruth did some pretty wonderful things for people . It 's just not important enough . Once there was this really sick kid . So sick , in fact , that he couldn 't even get out of bed to go to the ballpark . Quit the hearts and flowers , will you ? Babe Ruth visited this kid at the hospital . He promised to hit a home run just for him . Yeah ? Yeah . And if we don 't get Babe Ruth back on the right track , the kid 'll never meet Babe . What 's a hot dog ? ( PLUMMETING ) Jeffrey ? I 'm okay , Bogg . Nothing broken . Except this darn Omni . The Omni 's broken ? ( BEEPING ) The gear 's stuck in the automatic mode . Oh . Days like this I wish voyagers had gone union . We don 't get overtime pay , paid vacations ... 1669 , England . Flashing red . I wonder what 's wrong . Oh , blast ! Oh ... ( EXCLAIMING ) Here you go . Oh , I 'm most grateful . Newton . Bogg , this is Jeffrey . Beautiful day like this must be perfect inspiration for a writer . Well , I 'm not actually a writer . I 'm a professor here at Cambridge . My father was a teacher there . Oh , yes , and a very good one , I 'm sure . However , lately , I 've been feeling more like a student myself . I 've been working on a problem for weeks . A hypothesis on gravity . ( CHUCKLING ) Oh , it 's far too nice a day to worry about any of my dubious theories . Thank you . Good day . Bogg , that was Newton . Sir Isaac Newton . " Sir " Newton ? Well , he hasn 't been knighted yet . And he never will be out there . We have to get him there , under that apple tree . BOGG : Why ? JEFFREY : Gravity . Mr. Newton . Are you all right ? I beg your pardon ? Sunburn . Sunstroke . But it 's been cloudy all day . That 's worse . Much worse . How long have you been out here ? Well , when I 'm working , I lose complete track of time . But , perhaps you 're right . Maybe I should pack up and go home . BOGG : Well ... ( BOGG CHUCKLING ) I don 't know if that 's really necessary . No sense stopping your work . Sit under this beautiful , shady tree . Why , thank you . ( BEEPING ) Yes , yes , this is much more comfortable . Ouch ! Blasted apple ! Hit me straight on the head . Dropped off the tree and fell on my head as if some force propelled it back towards the earth . Thank you , gentlemen . Our pleasure . Now we can get back to New York . After we go to the Red Sox 's 1919 spring training . No . We 're going back to New York City , 1927 . But , Bogg , you promised . I know , I 'm sorry , but I changed my mind . Voyagers ' prerogative . Bogg , what about baseball ? What about the kid in the hospital ? You caught me at a weak moment , all right ? All the sob stories in the world aren 't gonna change the fact that we 're still talking about baseball . But ... Jeffrey , it 's only a game . That 's it ! The apple was pulled by the Earth 's gravity . That 's it . Bogg , it 's only an apple . Come on , slap them . Make them work . Make them work . Let 's go . Go down there and get some sweat popping on those guys , will you ? Well , good morning , Mr. Ruth . I 'm so pleased that you could join us . You 're late ! Well , I 'm sorry , Mr. Barrow . But I don 't need a curfew , and you know that . I mean , I 'm out all night and here I am , sharp as a tack . As manager of this team it 's my job to enforce the rules . So , you miss one more bed check and you 're gonna find yourself on the bench . No , you can 't afford that and you know it . I 'm the best pitcher you got ! Yeah , well , one more word , you 're gonna be doing your pitching in batting practice . Why don 't you listen to me , Barrow ? You got better pitchers , why don 't you play them ? BOGG : I 'm better . Are you talking to me ? Yes , sir . So you 're better than the Babe , huh ? That 's right . Yeah , well , that 's one man 's opinion , yours . Why don 't you let him try out ? Then you can decide . Yeah , you 're a big , strong-Iooking fellow . Where 'd you play last ? The bush leagues in Texas . They play some pretty wild and wooly ball down there . What have I got to lose ? Okay , rookie , you got your shot . Suit up . I hope you know what you 're doing , or we 're both gonna look like a couple of fools . Trust me , Bogg . Just trust me . I 'll never pitch as good as Babe . You gotta pitch better than Babe . As long as Babe 's a pitcher , he 'll never hit 60 home runs . JEFFREY : I 'm teaching you how to throw sliders , screwballs and knucklers . All these pitches haven 't even been invented yet . Nobody around here 's ever seen anything like them before . That 's it . You 're tougher to please than Abner Doubleday . You were there when Abner Doubleday invented baseball ? Well , I knew him as Captain Doubleday at Fort Sumter . We tossed the ball around a little bit between battles . He thought my pitching was pretty good . Give me a break . Okay , kid , let 's see what you got . Hank ! Give me a couple of hitters in there . Good ones . MAN 1 : Macready ? Got you . MAN 2 : Okay , kid , show us what you got . ( MAN CHATTERING ) I don 't know what it is , but he 's sure moving it around . He has a crazy style , doesn 't he ? Yeah , but there 's no arguing with a guy that throws every pitch over for a strike . Your friend , he 's pretty good , kid . Yeah . Yes , Mr. Ruth . BABE : He throws a lot of trick pitches . And the way his leg comes up , I figured for a second there he 's gonna start tap dancing or something . But he sure makes that ball dance before it goes across the plate , though , don 't he ? I 've never seen a man throw a ball like that before . Boy , he 's a darn good pitcher . Pitching 's not everything . It is to a pitcher , kid . Well , Babe , what do you think ? Any fool can see he 's good . Good ? He 's great ! Now that I got a new ace , you 're not gonna be able to be a bad boy no more . Let 's not get into that again . You miss one bed check and I bench you . You miss two curfews and I suspend you . Will you stop yelling ? I suspend you without pay ! You 're gonna start living by the same rules as the rest of the team . You got it ? I got it ! Yeah , I got it . Maybe the rest of the team would be better off without me altogether . Suit yourself . Hey , kid . You 're really something . Hey , Barrow ! Where have you been hiding this dynamo ? MAN : Where 'd you find him ? Yeah , what 's his name ? What 's your name , kid ? Bogg . Phineas Bogg . Men , here 's your big story of the day . ( CAMERA CLICKING ) Gentlemen of the press , I want you to meet the new Red Sox pitching sensation , Phineas Bogg . ( MEN CHEERING ) Gee , I never seen anything like that . Boy , are you terrific ! You 're the greatest I 've ever seen ! You know , without your coaching , there 's no way I could 've thrown those pitches . Abner never would 've believed a ball could move like that . You ought to be real proud of yourself . Yeah . JEFFREY : I didn 't know he was gonna take it so hard . He wasn 't supposed to quit the game . Guess that 's why the Omni is red , huh ? So we got to do a little bit more . Like what ? You know how to hit those pitches you taught me ? Sure . I was cleanup man on my Little League team . How about teaching the Babe ? Mr. Ruth . Yeah , kid . Aren 't you gonna eat your lunch ? No . Kind of lost my appetite . And that ain 't no everyday occurrence , either . Did Mr. Barrow kick you off the team ? Not yet . But it 's only a matter of time , I figure . He only put up with my shenanigans because he didn 't have somebody better , and now with your friend , he 's definitely got somebody better . I figure the gentlemanly thing to do is probably quit before Barrow has to fire me . What do you think ? Isn 't baseball more important than staying up late ? Baseball 's probably more important to me than anything , except maybe the respect of my teammates . Did you see them when Barrow ripped into me , how they were laughing ? You see , those guys used to look up to me before . I just don 't know if I can play on a team when everybody 's feeling sorry for me . Maybe I 'm finished . Finished ? Babe Ruth 's the greatest player baseball ever knew . Come on , kid . You 're a hero to millions of kids . Yeah , I 'm not the hero now . Your friend is . And I taught him everything he knows . And you did good , too . I mean , he went through that whole lineup and nobody even got a bat on a ball . What if you could hit those pitches ? ( SCOFFING ) Come on . In fact , what if you could hit those pitches out of the park ? If I could hit like that ... If I could hit like that , I 'd give up pitching tomorrow . Take a breather , kid ! You 're going great . How 's it going with the Babe ? You 'll see . Think he can hit off me ? I taught him everything he knows . Well , don 't worry . I 'll take it easy on him . Well , Babe , I thought you 'd quit the team . No , Barrow , you can call me a lot of things , but a quitter ain 't one of them . Hotshot . How about trying to get some of those trick pitches by me , huh ? All right . Come on , Babe , rip it . MAN 1 : Hit the sky , Babe ! ( MEN CHATTERING ) Holy cow , look at that ball sail ! MAN 2 : Attaboy , Babe . Show this rookie . Nobody 's ever gotten near that pitch before . MAN 3 : Hit it , Babe . ( ALL EXCLAIMING ) I knew he could do it . I can 't get over it . The more he swings , the further he hits them . I could use him in the lineup everyday . Too bad he 's a pitcher . Yeah , you can 't use a pitcher everyday . If he wasn 't a pitcher , he could play in the outfield . Yeah , then he could play every day . Okay , Bogg , I 've seen enough ! We knew you could hit , Babe , but you killed those balls . Babe , how 'd you figure out that new kid 's pitches ? ( CLAMORING ) That was great , Bogg , the way you took it easy on him . Yeah , well , you know , the idea was to make him look good , so ... Yeah , well , thanks to you , he 's gonna be the greatest hitter in baseball . Now , can we get back to New York to find Cleopatra ? We gotta stick around . Hang on , kid . We 're on our way to New York . ( CLAMORING ) Terrific idea . How 'd you like to play everyday ? ( ALL CHEERING ) JEFFREY : There it is . Isn 't it something ? Yeah . What 's wrong ? Nothing . Come on , Jeff . You can tell me . ( SOBBING ) Last time I was here was with my dad . He used to take me to ball games all the time . We 'd sit right behind the Yankee dugout . One time he caught a foul ball and got the whole team to autograph it for me . ( WEEPING ) Your dad sounds like a pretty good guy . The greatest . ( SNIFFLING ) I don 't want anybody to see me cry . They 'll think I 'm a sissy . Why would they think that ? 'Cause men aren 't supposed to cry . Says who ? What about Napoleon at Waterloo ? George Washington at Valley Forge . General Eisenhower at Bunker Hill . ( LAUGHING ) You okay now ? Yeah . Come on . Come on , let 's go . Hey , you know who Babe Ruth is ? Are you kidding ? Come on , kid . Who hasn 't heard of the Babe ? Greatest hitter the game has ever known . Keep it . You guys look like a couple of real fans . For the wrong team , but that 's okay . Yeah , thanks . Thanks a lot . Now we search this city till we find Cleopatra . Yeah , and where do we look first ? I don 't know . " Coolidge chooses not to run for reelection . " Florenz Ziegfeld 's new show opens to rave reviews . " We found her . Where ? Yeah , that looks like her all right , but I 'm not sure . Her hair 's a lot shorter . No , it 's her all right . Look at the bracelet . Yeah , the snake bracelet . Who 's the guy ? " Patrons of Lucky Luciano 's club " couldn 't keep their eyes off the mystery vamp on Luciano 's arm . " Now we know why they call him Lucky . " Jeff , it 's Cleo ! Lucky , can I trust the rest of your accomplices ? It 's almost closing time . The only people left inside are a few loyal patrons and a couple of my trusted colleagues . Come on . The less witnesses , the better , I suppose . Yeah , look , we 're late already . Come on . No , wait . If I 'm to be involved in a kidnapping ... ( SHUSHES ) A kidnapping , I think I should know every detail of the plot . Come on , toots , don 't worry your pretty little head with details , huh ? He 's already inside . All you got to do is keep him busy tonight , all night . Come on . You make it sound very easy . Hey , for you , it will be , toots . Just peel him a few grapes like you did for me , huh ? But remember , Lucky , we have an agreement . I do this job for you ... Yeah , yeah , and I take you to the White House to meet Emperor Calvin Coolidge , okay ? Come on . I have your word of honor ? Look , I 'm telling you , there 's no problem . Me and Coolidge , we 're just like this . Hey , come on . Good evening , Mr. Luciano . There 's some heavy action in the back room , Mr. Luciano . ( GLASSES CLINKING ) Kidnapping ? Is she crazy ? Come on . Wait ! Remember , that 's Lucky Luciano ! Bad guy , right ? Very bad . Then we 'll have to be careful how we get her out of there . How are we gonna get inside ? We 're just a couple of guys looking for a good time . Then I think it 's time we break training . Break what ? You 're a little underdressed for a night out on the town . ( KNOCKING ) Lucky sent me . We 're closing . Lucky said whenever I was in town . Well , I guess you got time for a short one . Hey , no kids allowed . Kid goes where I go . But he 's too young . It ain 't legal . It 's Prohibition , pal . Everybody 's too young . I ain 't gonna call the cops . Are you ? And don 't ever lay a hand on my kid again . Boy , a guy can say anything as long as he can say it tough . Just don 't try any smart moves , huh ? These guys can get pretty rough . You could get into trouble . Hey , I can take care of myself . Face it , kid , you ain 't old enough to be tough . I want you to stay here . Oh , Bogg . And no arguments . Stay . I expected you to find me sooner or later , but right now is a little inopportune . Sorry to inconvenience you , but I 've got to get you out of here . I 'm not going anywhere . Oh , yes , you are . I can 't go back now . I 've got a job to do . We know all about you and your boyfriend 's kidnapping plan . Kidnapping is such an ugly word . This sort of thing happens all the time . In ancient Rome , maybe . Lucky made a very large wager on a sporting event . It 's something about some old man called Homer getting hit . Lucky wants me to stop that from happening . Now , is that so bad ? Yeah . Hey , toots , is this guy bothering you ? Yes , Lucky , he is . Stop annoying the lady , huh ? She 's no lady . ( CHUCKLING ) I mean , she 's just a friend . We sort of lost track of each other over the years . Hey , that 's real nice , pal . The reunion is over , huh ? So , get out ! ( MUSIC STOPS ) ( PEOPLE APPLAUDING ) Wait , Bogg ! Look . It 's Babe ! BOGG : Why would Lucky Luciano want to kidnap Babe Ruth ? JEFFREY : So he wouldn 't hit the homer ! Some hero he turned out to be , beating up on some old guy named Homer . Home run ! Tomorrow must be the day when Babe Ruth is supposed to hit his 60th home run . And Luciano wants to make sure that he won 't , so he hires Cleopatra to keep him busy . Well , he sure got the right girl for the job . Come on . Hey , Bogg , we can 't leave . We 're not leaving . You are . But , Bogg ... These guys play pretty rough . I don 't want you hurt . Bogg ... No arguments ! But Bogg , I have an idea . You remind me of Julius . The same strong profile . Yeah ? This Julius , he 's your boyfriend ? Before he was killed . Sorry . It was a long time ago . A very long time ago . You sure this plan of yours is gonna work ? Sure . I saw James Cagney do it in a gangster movie on TV . Can 't miss . You were right . Kid never could hold his milk and cookies . A very long time ago . I thought I 'd find you here . Hey , what 's the matter ? The Yankee front office send you out here to check on me ? You little two-timing princess . Don 't I recognize you ? Hey , pal , I 'm talking to the lady , okay ? Have a seat . Bogg , will you get out of here ? You 're gonna ruin everything . Bogg ? Julius Bogg . Her husband . Cleo , hey , you told me this guy was dead . Her late husband . You 're not gonna listen to him . He 's mad ! You 're darn right I 'm mad . ( GROANING ) How dare you ! You all right , Cleo ? No ! Hey , pal , that ain 't no way to treat a lady , even if she is your wife . Oh , yeah ? Yeah . Well , how about settling this outside , clown ? That 's a good idea . Maybe I could teach you a little common courtesy . Babe , you can 't leave . I mean , Babe , please , don 't leave ! Babe ! Please don 't leave . This Philistine isn 't worth fighting . BABE : I 'm fighting for your honor , Cleo . Bogg , come on . Babe ! Come on . You and me , buster , we got a little score to settle here , huh ? Babe , please , come back inside . No , not till I teach this guy a little respect . Come on . Put up your dukes . Now , stop this . You 're behaving like barbarians . I don 't wanna fight you . You should 've thought about that before you popped the lady with a grapefruit . Will you just get in the car , I 'll explain everything . Explain it now ! Cleo and her pal Luciano wanted to kidnap you . Now why would we do that ? Yeah , why would they do that ? It seems Mr. Luciano had a bet you wouldn 't hit your 60th home run tomorrow , that 's why . Cleo , what 's this guy talking about ? Babe , I am going back inside , and you are coming with me . ( BOGG LAUGHS ) Bogg , come on ! Sorry , Cleo , he 's coming with us , and so are you . Hey , Mr. Ruth , you wasn 't gonna leave without saying good night , was you ? Good night . ( EXCLAIMS ) Come on . Move over , kid . Hey , this is my turf . I know all the shortcuts . Yeah , great . You can navigate . CLEOPATRA : He 's ruined everything . I command you to stop this car ! No way . You 're too good at getting into trouble . I wasn 't in any trouble until you showed up . And stopped you and Luciano from kidnapping him . What 's a hood like Luciano gonna do for a girl like you , anyway ? Get me an audience with the Emperor . What emperor ? Emperor Coolidge . This dame 's a nickel short . I don 't think Lucky Luciano even knows President Coolidge . I don 't believe you . Did Lucky tell you that President Coolidge isn 't very handsome ? For me it is power , not beauty , that holds the most allure . And he 's a lot older than you . A young man is seldom wise enough to rule an empire . And he 's not gonna be reelected . Can 't this car go any faster ? Take a shortcut , Bogg . Turn here . ( TIRES SCREECH ) BOGG : Faster . Watch out ! ( CRASHING ) ( ENGINE STALLING ) Hey , come on ! That was some shortcut , kid . But there was a street there when I lived in New York . I think we lost one . If I can find a safe place for Babe to spend the night ... And then we 'll take Cleo home after the game . Hey , we can stay at Lou 's . Lou Gehrig 's ? Yeah , where else ? Wow . Here we go , fans . It 's the bottom of the ninth and here comes the Babe . Hey , Jeff , I hope Luciano 's ready to get a new nickname . Today ain 't gonna be his lucky day . I 'm gonna hit the 60th and he 's gonna lose a bundle . MAN ON SPEAKER ... Now batting , the New York Yankees . ( MAN CHATTERING ) ( CROWD CHEERING ) This one 's for you , kid . Babe 's had a perfect day so far , two singles and a walk . But believe me , fans , no one has left this ball park . This is the Babe 's last chance to break his own record of 59 home runs . Set back in 1921 . For six long years , the Babe has been knocking on that door , and this is his last chance in 1927 . I mean , this Yankee team with its famed Murderers ' Row clinched that pennant a long time ago . And my only question to that man is , " Can the Sultan of Swat hit 60 home runs ? " Here 's the wind-up . And the pitch , swung on and missed . Strike one ! Now the pressure down there has got to be tremendous , not only on the Babe , fans , but that pitcher down there doesn 't wanna be known as the man who served up home run number 60 to Babe Ruth . Ball ! Oh , that was blowing away , ball one . Count evens out at one and one . Here 's the wind-up . The pitch , swung on and missed , strike two ! I tell you , the Babe wasn 't just swinging for a single there , fans . He was swinging for those seats . The count now is one and two . One ball and two strikes . Babe is down to his last strike . And here comes the pitch . ( CROWD CHEERING ) You better kiss that goodbye . All right ! Babe Ruth , the greatest home run hitter of all time , has just hit number 60 ! BABE : Hey , kid ! You fellows don 't have to leave , do you ? We got to . Look , I owe you a lot . Thanks . Our pleasure . But promise me , you 're gonna see me next season , right ? Promise ? We 'll sure try . You got a minute ? Oh , yeah , sure . Several years ago I met a boy just like you . I was about to quit the game , but he told me I was his hero . Even showed me a little bit about hitting . Turns out kids with curly black hair must be my good luck charms . Bogg , did you see him ? Down two strikes , and the Babe still came through . Well , with two strikes I would have thrown them a slider . You double-crossing little bimbo . Bogg , I think I want to go back to my own time after all . Can you kiss me now ?

He 's always had a crush on me . He doesn 't look so bad from here . Oh , he 's as strong and as handsome as any man I 've ever met , but he has no craving for power . Rest your horses . It 's been my experience that behind every great man , is a great woman . Power is an acquired taste . Maybe I could teach him to savor it the way I do .

 There he is , Bogg ! That 's Old Hickory ! General Jackson ! Fire ! Where 's Captain Lafitte ? He 's a French pirate . He 's supposed to be fighting for Jackson now . Hey , don 't be leaving me so fast . I know where the pirate 's treasure is hidden . Hello , matey . JEFFREY : Bogg , there 's five more of them . Voyagers don 't run from a fight . JEFFREY : Bogg ! BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! Hey , they 're coming ! They 're coming ! Scatter ! Scatter ! Clear the street ! MAN : Come on , boy , let 's go ! ( PLUMMETING ) It sure is quiet . Too quiet . ( BEEPING ) New Orleans , 1850 . Yeah , so what 's wrong ? Beats me . Something 's gotta be wrong , the Omni 's red . So are their uniforms . Whose uniforms ? Stop it ! Let go ! Shut up , Yank , or we 'll hang you ourselves . Go back to England ! This is our country ! Leave him alone ! After them ! Get those kids ! This is all wrong , Bogg . The redcoats aren 't supposed to be ... ( GUN FIRES ) Shooting at us ? You 're telling me , kid . Come on , run ! What are they shooting at us for ? Because we 're not on their side . How do they know ? Wait a minute . Whose side are we on ? The American side . That the same side as those kids throwing rotten tomatoes ? ( GUN FIRING ) Great . Wait ! We 're on your side . What 's going on ? What is that all about ? Haven 't you heard that the redcoats have declared martial law ? You mean the British are in control of the city ? They have ever since the Battle of New Orleans . Come on , Sam , run ! Where have you guys been ? Who 's that guy those soldiers were dragging off ? That 's one of Jackson 's officers . They 're gonna string him up . What happened to General Jackson ? Nobody knows . I sure hope he got away . We were supposed to win the Battle of New Orleans . What happened ? How did they break the American line ? What about Jean Lafitte ? Jean Lafitte ? The only Lafitte I know is Pierre Lafitte . Maybe they 're related . Where can we find him ? He 's got the bakery shop across the street over there . Look , we 're forming a resistance group . You know , an underground . There 's a meeting tonight at St. Anne 's Church at 7 : 00 . If you 're with us , you be there . ( GUN FIRING ) Sure is confusing . What should 've happened ? General Jackson 's troops routed the British out of the middle of some swamp . The redcoats didn 't even get close to the city . The victory made Old Hickory a national hero . He 's supposed to be elected President in 1828 . What about John Lafitte ? Jean Lafitte . He 's a French pirate in control of the swamps . He 's supposed to be on our side . I guess we better find out what happened . Come on . Are they gone ? Yeah , but they 'll be coming back . It 's terrible . Terrible . They treat us like slaves in our own country . Did you ever hear tell of another Lafitte , Jean Lafitte ? He was my brother . Was ? He 's been dead a long time . Did you know him ? We knew of him . I don 't care what anyone says , Jean was a fine man and a wonderful brother . Who said he wasn 't ? People . Liars . Why ? What happened ? He was charged with piracy and hanged by the Spanish . But it wasn 't true . When did it happen ? The summer of 1798 . It was one of my first trips to New Orleans . He sent me a letter saying that he had found lodging at over a tavern in Nassau , Two Maids From Bristol , it was called . Here they come ! Everybody off the streets . ( GUN FIRING ) Mr. Lafitte , let us in . There 's two of them ! Get them ! I think I 've seen enough . We gotta get the rest of the story from Pierre . We gotta find out what happened to Jean . We got a date and a place . That 's plenty . You stay where you are ! You 're right . That is plenty . What ... Where did they go ? Where are they ? What happened ? Hurry , will you ? I 'm doing it as fast as I can . ( PLUMMETING ) This doesn 't look like the Bahamas to me . Must 've stuck on automatic again . At least nobody 's pointing guns at us . Try bows and arrows . CLARK : They 're turning tails . They 're running . If we spent 100 years trooping around this country , I 'd still never be able to figure out those people . I guess they must 've seen what one of these can do to a man . Ah , excuse me . We didn 't mean to scare you . Where did you two come from ? From Canada . We 're trappers . Who cares where they came from ? Boy , other than our party , you 're the first white faces we 've seen in months . Where is the rest of your party ? Camped a few miles back . I 'm William Clark , this is Meriwether Lewis . This is Phineas Bogg . I 'm Jeffrey Jones . Hello , Jeff . JEFFREY : It 's great to meet you both . I thought Clark and Lewis were comedians ? That was Martin and Lewis . Oh . Bogg , these are America 's greatest explorers . Oh . What were you doing up in that tree ? We were trying to decide whether to follow that ridge or go down through that valley . See , I figured if I got up in that tree , I could get a better look . I got a feeling that ridge is gonna lead to the edge of a cliff . There could be a river down in that valley . Or a box canyon with sheer walls . At least we can see where we 're going if we follow the ridge . But the flow of the river will take us toward the ocean . So will the sun . How do you know there is a river down there ? You know , sometimes , William , you 're such a dreamer . I think America 's greatest explorers are lost . I 've got an idea . Instead of standing here talking about it , why don 't we all go a little ways along the ridge ? Maybe there 's a spot where we can get a good look down into that canyon . The boy has a point . And if your instincts are correct , we 'll be that much further on our way . All right , I 'll lead the way . JEFFREY : Check the Omni , quick . ( BEEPING ) Red light . Must be the other trail . Hey , wait ! Look , down there , through the trees ! Isn 't that water ? Maybe it 's a river ! I don 't see anything . Neither do I. All right , Meriwether , let 's try it your way . We 'll stay on the ridge . Look ! The Indians are back ! Where ? On the trail ahead . I don 't see anything . Yeah , well , that 's the way it is with the Indians around here . So clever you never see them until it 's too late . Way to go . Well , maybe we should try that other trail . You thought you saw water down there , didn 't you , son ? Well , it sure looked like water . Can 't hurt to take a look . Just in case . Green light . Hey , did you really see Indians ? Did you really see water ? ( BOTH LAUGHING ) Oh , Nassau , right ? 1798 . Okay . Come on , lads , time be a-wasting ! Look lively , there ! The tide will be on us soon enough . ( PLUMMETING ) Hold it , lads . Move along . Move along ! ( OMNI BEEPING ) One thing 's for sure , it 's a beach . 1798 , the Bahamas . Right where we 're supposed to be . Okay . Yeah , but on the second try . So , which way is Nassau ? We got to find Lafitte . Down the beach , around those rocks . You sure ? Hey , kid , I was a pirate long before I was a voyager . Where do you think I got these clothes ? Come on . You know , Jeff , I have a good feeling about this place . Hey , Bogg , what 's behind these rocks ? Bogg , look ! Hello , matey . Come here , boy ! I want to talk to you . Bogg , help ! So , it 's two snoopers who 'd steal an old sailor 's prize , is it ? What 's he talking about ? I didn 't know you were there . Honest , I didn 't ! That 's your hard luck , sonny . ( GRUNTS ) Mates ! Over here ! Wait here . Come on , Bogg , let 's get out of here . No way , kid . Voyagers don 't run from a fight . On the other hand , voyagers aren 't stupid . Come on . Get after ' em ! Come on , kid , we can outrun them ! Hurry , lads , we 're gaining on ' em ! Don 't let ' em get away ! Come on ! Oh , forget it , we 'll never catch ' em . BOGG : See , I told you we could outrun them . JEFFREY : My feet are killing me . This is it . What do you think of Nassau ? Wow , this place is great ! You should 've seen it 100 years ago . Now , those were the good old days . Some of the greatest pirates in all of history walked these very streets , Captain Kidd , Calico Jack , Blackbeard . And Jean Lafitte , remember ? Yeah , I didn 't forget . It 's just that , well , some of my best friends have been pirates . You know , you would have made a great tour guide at Disneyland . Disneyland ? Is that a country ? ( CHUCKLING ) Bogg , give it up . Look , there it is . Two Maids From Bristol . You wait out here . I 'll see if I can get a line on Lafitte . Wait , I want to go with you . What if that guy with the black eye patch is inside ? I 'm not scared of him . MAN : Stay out of here , you scurvy bum . On the other hand , that 's probably not much of a place for kids anyway . I 'll be right back . Hey , fellow , watch your step there , huh ? Got a couple of coppers for an old sailor ? Maybe next time . Please , matey , anything 'll help . BOGG : I 'm sorry . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) ( MUSIC STOPS ) ( MURMURING ) ( MUSIC PLAYING ) ( PEOPLE LAUGHING ) Hello . PARROT : What 'll it be , mate ? That 's enough of that , now ! That 's enough of that , now ! God save King George ! You be quiet on your perch or I 'll wring your neck . Haven 't seen you around . Yeah , I just got into port . If you 're looking for lodging , I got two rooms left . I don 't know how long I 'll be staying , it all depends on whether I can find the brother of an old shipmate or not . Oh ? What might his name be ? Jean Lafitte . So , it 's Jean Lafitte you 're looking for . You know him ? Oh , indeed I do . He 's right over there , having a little chat with Lizzie . He must tell a good story . He does have a way about him , that one . Think I 'll go over and say hello . Thanks a lot . Hey ! Hey ! Don 't be leaving me so fast . I was just starting to like you . It 'll just be a minute . He 'll be there . Besides , it 'd be rude to interrupt right in the best part of his story . ( CHUCKLING ) You know , I 'll bet that you have a few stories of your own to tell . You 've probably heard them all . Why don 't you let me be the judge of that ? Got a penny for an old sailor ? BLIND MAN : Help a poor , blind man , mate . MAN : Get out of the way , you old bum . How about a hand , mate ? Help a poor , blind man . Here you go . Hey , let go ! Open your hand . Is that all you got , boy ? No , sir , but ... Hey , wait a minute , you 're not blind ! And you 're not doing enough to help the poor . Now give me your purse and be quick about it ! No ! Bogg ! Let me go , you old bum . BLIND MAN : Come back here . You little ... Come back here ! Where are you , boy ? Are you hiding in here ? You won 't get away from old Rufus . Where 'd he go ? Get you , boy . I 'll get you . SCROGGINS : In here , Scar , so we can talk in private . SCAR : This better be good . Come on . All right , Scroggins , let 's have it . There 's a Spanish merchantman due in the harbor any day now . I hear tell she 's as ripe a prize as my good eye has ever seen . Silks , lace , barrels of rum bigger than that one . A chest of gold . Payment for the goods she delivered to Veracruz . Now , what do you say , Scar ? Would old Bill Scroggins steer a poor man 's course ? With enough likely lads as yourself , we can take her easy . You already have the rest of the crew ? Some 's aboard already , clamoring to set sail . The others are down at the Two Maids From Bristol . What are they doing down there ? Why aren 't they out helping the others ? 'Cause they don 't know they 're part of the crew just yet . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) A couple of friends is recruiting ' em just now . All we 'll have to do is pick ' em up just afore we sail . What do you say , Scar , are you with me ? I 'll probably be with you in hell , Bill Scroggins . At least we 'll be together . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) ( MUSIC PLAYING ) Now , you 've seen Pierre . My brother is well ? You 're sure of it ? Yes , when I saw him , he was as fit as I am . Jean , can 't we talk about this later ? I haven 't seen my brother in two years . I wasn 't even sure if he was alive . He said if I was ever in Nassau , to be sure and look you up . Are you sure you don 't want anything to eat ? No , thanks , I 'm fine . What did he say ? Did he have a message for me ? Yes , he said to tell you to come to New Orleans . I 've heard it said that a man can make his fortune in New Orleans . A man can make his fortune right here in Nassau . Besides , how could I leave my Lizzie ? That 's right . Your brother 's gonna be awfully disappointed . It sounded like he misses you a lot . I miss him , too , but New Orleans is so far away . Not that far away . Why don 't we go down to the harbor right now and board a ship bound for New Orleans . You can 't leave . We only just met . But don 't you see ? It 's best this way . There 's no sad memories and all that kind of junk . What 's wrong with him ? Are you okay ? You 're going on a ship all right , but it 's not to New Orleans . You 're going with him . Oh , my head hurts . What are we doing here ? We 've been shanghaied . Annie and Lizzie are going to sell the lot of us to be crew on some ship . Not just some ship . Black Bill Scroggins ' ship . Big guy with a black patch over one eye ? You 're sure it 'll be Bill Scroggins ' ship ? I saw them two ladies talking to him the night before they snatched me . ( LAUGHS ) Perfect ! Perfect ? They drug your food , lock you up in their basement and sell you onto some pirate ship where you 'll probably end up as some shark 's lunch , and you call it perfect ? Yes . I 've been trying to figure a way to get close to Scroggins for weeks . He 's supposed to have a chest full of gold and jewels that he took from the Manila Galleon . Why didn 't you just offer to sign on his ship ? He 's too suspicious . Besides , no one ever wants to join one of his crews . I don 't believe this guy . Bogg . Don 't worry , he 's a friend . Kid , you okay ? I 'm fine . How about you ? In shock . I tried everything I could think of to save this guy , but no dice . He wants to be shanghaied . I bet you can 't guess whose ship we 're gonna end up on . Oh , yes , I can . Black Bill Scroggins ' ship . And that 's not the worst part of it . I overheard Scroggins planning to attack a Spanish merchant ship . Pierre Lafitte said it was the Spanish that hanged Jean for piracy . That 's why we 've got to get you and him out of here , and fast . The only way of getting him out of here is to carry him . Why does he want to be on Scroggins ' ship so bad ? He wants to get near Scroggins so he can get his treasure . You mean the one we saw them burying ? Must be . The women who run the tavern , what are their names ? Anne Brown and Lizzie ... I don 't know . Why ? I 'm gonna go have a talk with them . About what ? Buried treasure , what else ? ( HORSE SNUFFLING ) Somebody 's coming . Got to go . Jeffrey , wait ! Not too much now , Your Majesty . Not too much now , Your Majesty . All right , what 's wrong with you ? We ought to keep those two for ourselves . I was starting to like the new one . There 's plenty more where that scurvy pair came from . Just wait till the next ship comes in . Who knows ? Prince Charming himself might be on board ! Right . Searching the world to find the perfect lady to be his queen . Lucky for him he 's got two of us to choose from ! ( LAUGHING ) Hey , hold on , boy ! What do you want in here ? I 'm looking for the owner . You 're looking at the owner . One of them , anyway . Where can we talk ? " Where can we talk ? " Over here . The name 's Jones , Jamaica Jones , off the brigantine Shark just out of the Dry Tortugas . Well , I 'm Anne Brown , this is Lizzie Palmer . So , what 's this all about ? It 's about buried treasure . That 's what it 's about . He 's a little young to be Prince Charming , but ... Maybe he 's looking for a Queen Mother . As you were saying ... I know where a pirate 's chest is hidden , and I 'm willing to cut you in for a share . Oh , you are , are you ? Why me and Lizzie ? I mean , you don 't know us from old Eve herself . You 've got a mate of mine locked up downstairs in your cellar . And I want him back . In the cellar ? What are you talking about ? I 'm talking about a chest this big , full of gold and jewels . ( PARROT SQUAWKING ) Maria ! MARIA : Sí , señora , what do you want ? I want you to keep an eye on the place . We 'll be gone a while . I don 't want to escape to New Orleans and start a little shop with Pierre . I want to stay here . I like being a pirate . I know . I 've been a pirate for longer than you 'd ever believe . But I 've known them all and you 're special . You 're a natural born leader . You 're gonna do something important ... Yes , one day when I have my own ship . Captain Jean Lafitte , they 'll call me . Not if you join up with Scroggins , they won 't . How could you know that ? You can 't know the future . No , but I know what the great captains of the past were like . They were like me ? Oh , yeah , very much like you . ( DOOR OPENS ) Move ! ANNIE : Now , get back ! How could you do this ? How could you sell me to that awful Bill Scroggins ? It was easy . Hey , you 're coming with us . And one more man to help with the shoveling . Pick one . Quick . MAN : Take me . I 'll go . I 'll do it . This one . Me ? Dig ? I 'm sick . I can 't go . We 're gonna dig up Scroggins ' treasure , you idiot . But , on the other hand , maybe a little exercise would make me feel better . Nice job , kid . It 'll be easy to slip away once they get their hands on that treasure . If I can just remember exactly where they buried it . Over here . I think this is it . You think this is it ? Here . You heard him . Start digging . Where ? Where is it ? It 's here someplace . This is a big beach , kid . When we start digging through the jewels , it will be easy . You take Anne . I 'll take Lizzie . Hey ! Cut the gab ! You 're here to dig ! ( SQUAWKING ) PARROT : What 'll it be , matey ? Look out ! Parrot soup 's what it 'll be , matey ! Yes ? Where 's Anne and the other one ? Not here . I 'm watching the place . Well , they 're supposed to be here . We got business , me and them . Sorry . You 're gonna be more than sorry if you don 't tell me where they went . They left with a boy . Boy ? Black , curly hair ? Red shirt ? The little weasel ! ( SQUAWKING ) Hey , watch it , matey ! ANNIE : What are you gonna do ? Dig up the whole beach ? That tide must 've buried it deeper than I thought . But it 's here , believe me . JEAN : That 's it ! You found it . ( JEAN LAUGHS ) JEFFREY : See ? I told you ! Come on . ANNIE : Hurry up ! Get it out of there ! Lift it out ! This is very heavy . That 's because it 's very full . So , we meet again , mateys . What do you want here , Bill Scroggins ? That 's my chest you 're digging up . The chest belongs to whoever can hold on to it . ( ALL LAUGHING ) I think we better help these ladies . They can take care of themselves . Come on , lads . Lizzie , give me your sword . If you want a cutlass , you get one from them ! Look out , kid . JEFFREY : Look out ! JEFFREY : Bogg , there 's another one . Behind you ! Now , now , Annie , don 't make me hurt you . Don 't worry about me , Scroggins . Look out for yourself . Not bad for a woman ! ( YELLS ) Watch it ! I 've got you now , my beauty ! Get up and fight ! Come on , Scroggins . Say good night , you slimy little miscreant . Next time , I 'll cut it off . JEFFREY : Way to go , Bogg , just like Errol Flynn . Come on . ( LAUGHING ) BOGG : Now we 've got him . And now you don 't . ( SCREAMS ) Okay ! Now , what are you gonna do ? Don 't touch that sword . That 's it , run ! Come on , Bogg . ANNIE : Bogg , look out ! Hey , you 're pretty good with a sword . But how well can you swim ? ( EXCLAIMS ) Yeah ! Look at them run ! Yeah ! Looks like we did it , kid . Let 's get that chest open . Help me . Great fight ! Yeah ! You two are something else . Lizzie ! You were magnificent ! Back off ! But Lizzie , you 'll need someone strong to help you carry it to town . Uh-uh-uh . You 'd be surprised how strong two ladies can be when they want to be . JEAN : But Lizzie ... Get out of here ! All of you ! Wow ! What a couple of tough chicks ! Okay , we 're going . We get the message . And just keep going . I don 't believe this . We had the treasure in our hands , and we lost it to those women . Don 't feel bad . Those two are not ordinary women . Listen to him . If anyone knows women , it 's Bogg . Thanks , kid . I think . The women of New Orleans , what are they like ? BOGG : Far more beautiful than the women of Nassau . And more gentle ? Much more gentle . You know , my friend , I 've been thinking about what you said . This place is not for me . The people , they don 't know a natural leader when they see one . I think I shall find that ship you were talking about and go to New Orleans . I have a feeling you 're gonna do big things in New Orleans . ( SCOFFS ) ( CHUCKLES ) ( DINGS ) JEFFREY : Green light ! You know , kid , in all my years as a voyager , Lafitte 's the only one who ever tried to stop me from getting him out of trouble . But you did it . You got him started in the right direction . Yeah , but what if he makes a wrong turn somewhere between here and New Orleans ? You know , Bogg , I 've always wanted to meet Andrew Jackson . Well , you 're gonna get your chance . JACKSON : Keep a sharp lookout , men . Sharp lookout ! Wake up , there , Kelly . You can sleep for a week when this is over . It won 't be too much longer now . See anything ? Nothing yet . Why did it have to be foggy today of all days ? I don 't know that that fog means anything to get all riled up about , Mr. Bundy . They can 't see us any better than we can see them . You got a point , Andy . ( PLUMMETING ) One good thing about swamps , they 're soft . Yeah , and foggy . Just how it 's supposed to be . Is it the right date ? ( BEEPING ) January 8 , 1815 , and it 's red ! Maybe it 's not Lafitte . Let 's find out what 's going on . It 's going to be Lafitte . I know it is . Keep a sharp lookout there , boys . There he is , Bogg ! That 's Old Hickory ! General Jackson ! Where have you two fellows been ? We 've been waiting for you . You have ? Sure . For the flints and powder . Where 's Captain Lafitte ? You mean he isn 't with you ? Well , no . He took some of his men to bring back the flints and powder , which we desperately need . They 've been gone all night . They should 've been back before now . You can say that again . You two are with Captain Lafitte ? I mean , the way you 're dressed , I thought ... Yes , sir , we are with Captain Lafitte . We were supposed to meet him here at dawn . Well , it 's almost dawn . I hope for all our sakes he gets here pretty soon . We need his flints and we need his men . Don 't worry , General Jackson . He 'll be here in plenty of time . I knew it was Lafitte . Maybe he 's in some kind of trouble . He 's in trouble , all right . With me . Bogg , we 've gotta find him . The redcoats will attack at dawn . Without Lafitte 's men , without his flints and powder , there 's no way the Americans can hold them off . Yeah , all right . Start asking around . We have to find out where he was going . Look alive , men . BOGG : Must 've missed him . It 's getting lighter all the time . This has to be the right trail . It 's the one they said he 'd take . MAN : Finally this bloody fog is beginning to clear . Get down ! MAN 2 : Good . The sun can 't come out soon enough for me . You think we ought to try another trail ? No ! We 're already lost . We could walk right into the Yank lines . Why do they have to be lost right on our trail ? Bogg , look . Lafitte ! I knew he 'd be in some kind of trouble . Shh ! Stay where you are . Get back . Stay down . This is great . Just great . What are we gonna do ? It 's dawn ! The redcoats are gonna attack any minute now . Remember Lewis and Clark ? Lewis and Clark . Lewis and Clark ! Yeah , right ! Indians ! Right ! Ready ? Come on ! Hey , don 't shoot ! The Indians are after us . Indians ? I thought the colonials were up that way . Yeah , maybe they are , but you got to get past the Indians first . Yeah , and there must be 1000 of them right behind us ! A thousand of them ? Thank God you got weapons . Do you have any extras ? I don 't see anything . That 's the way it is with these Indians around here . They 're so clever , you never see them until it 's , well , too late . I couldn 't have said it better myself . One thing 's for sure . I won 't be caught out in the open like this . Down here , quick ! Go ahead , we 're right behind you . Take cover . Every man for himself . How good are you at dying ? I don 't know . I 've never tried it before . You never played Cowboys and Indians before ? Oh , that kind of dying . Well , hey . Okay , on the count of three . Ready ? One , two , three . ( BOTH GROANING ) Indians ? But I didn 't hear any gunshots . And I don 't see any arrows in them . Then what happened to them ? I don 't think I want to find out . Retreat ! Retreat ! Wake up , Bogg . Captain Lafitte is safe now . Come on . Let 's go . But don 't I know you ? We 'll talk about it later . You go on . We 'll catch up to you . Thank you , my friends . Thank you . I shall not forget this . Let 's go . Come on , Bogg , let 's get back to General Jackson ! MAN : The powder and the flints are here . Hurry up and get them passed out . Careful with that , kid , it 's heavy . No , I can handle it . Let me help you with that . Thanks . Looks like we made it . Yeah , check the Omni . I 'm afraid to . Thank you very much for helping us back there . We could not have made it without you . Lucky we happened to be there when you needed us . Again . I 'm sure I 've seen you somewhere . From Nassau . The Two Maids From Bristol ? Anne Brown ? You gotta remember Lizzie . But you 'd have to be much older ! That 's clean living for you . Say , what ever happened to your brother , Pierre ? He 's back at the boats , unloading . He 'll be as surprised to see you as I am . Get some of that powder down to battery C ! Yes , sir . Captain Lafitte ! Take some of your men down there , too . That battery could use some riflemen . Men , follow me ! Bring them on , Andy , we 're ready for them . Hold your horses , Mr. Bundy . Hold your horses . They 'll be here soon enough . Keep down , kid ! General Jackson ! I heard what you did for Captain Lafitte . He would have made it without us . That 's not what he says . When this is over ... ( BAGPIPES PLAYING ) JEFFREY : Bogg , what 's that ? BOGG : It 's the British , Jeff , they 're coming . This is it . Jeff , get back . I told you to stay down . ( EXPLOSION ) Nobody fires till I give the order ! ( EXPLOSION ) Fire ! Fire ! Fire ! ( EXPLOSION ) ( GUNS FIRING ) Reload and keep firing ! Reload and fire at will ! Retreat ! Retreat ! All right ! You did it , men . They 're running . They 're turning tail , Andy ! They 're running ! We did it ! We did it , Andy ! We did it ! We beat them ! I believe we did , Mr. Bundy ! I believe we did . JACKSON : Well done , men . Well done . What a victory ! Back in Nassau , long ago , you said I do something important in New Orleans . How did you know ? Sometimes I get these hunches about people . I had a feeling destiny had something planned for you . But to be part of such a victory , I never dreamed of being part of such a thing . Thank you , my friends . Thank you . You know , if he only knew how important this victory really is . What do you mean ? Well , this battle showed everybody the United States was no one to mess around with . These redcoats we beat were the best army in the world . They were the ones who beat Napoleon . Why didn 't you tell me that before the battle ? Pretty soon they 'll be calling General Jackson " The Hero of New Orleans . " I hope not . I don 't deserve it . Everybody here is a hero . My Kentuckyans , Captain Lafitte and his men , and the two of you . I said before the shooting started , I wanted to thank you personally when this was over . Oh , sir , just being with you here is all the thanks I need . Well , it 's not all the thanks I have to give . Mr. Bogg , raise him up here . For bravery in service of your country far beyond the call of duty . ALL : Hip , hip , hurray ! Wow ! When you grow up , son , get in touch with me . I have a feeling you 're gonna be a man who does some great things . Thanks . Let 's go , men . Here , Bogg , you deserve it more than I do . Oh , I don 't know about that . Besides , it looks better on you . JEFFREY ... If you want to learn more about Andrew Jackson , Jean Lafitte or the War of 1812 , take a voyage down to your public library . It 's all in books !

 Check the airline . Are you hyperventilating the patient ? Male nurse : No , doctor . Ready the bone wax . Metzenbaum scissors . Female nurse : Metzenbaum scissors . Get that cat out of here . Male nurse : Yes , sir . Ready to close . Remove the weitlander retractor . Female nurse : We 're closing , doctor . Remove the rainey clip , for god 's sake . Olsen : I appreciate your letting me Observe that brain operation today . Michael : It would 've been more complicated If he 'd needed one , But since you wanted to observe my technique , I- - That was very nice of you . Doctor , were you , uh , Were you interested in science as a child ? I don 't know if I was interested So much in the science As I was the slime that goes along with it . Snakes and frogs . When I saw how slimy the human brain was , I ... I knew that 's what I wanted to do With the rest of my life . What 's the matter , timon ? I thought you liked fish . They taste funny . Really ? It 's fresh . It came right out of that tank . [ utensil drops , dog whimpers ] You hooked my angel fish ? ! Why do you do these terrible things ? Because I love to see those veins In your temple throb . You--you- - I 'll kill you . Look here , you devil woman , You 'll never do this to another man ! Oh , yes , I will . I 'll do it , And I 'll do it , and I 'll do it again . Would you read that back to me ? I 'm afraid that might make me Sound pompous to your readers . Uh , " my brilliant research in brain transplantation " is unsurpassed And will probably make my name live beyond eternity . " No , that 's all right . Take out the " probably . " It makes me sound wishy-washy . You take your hands off me , you impotent prune ! Ohh ! My renoir ! I 'll kill you ! I get so excited when you get angry . It makes me feel so much closer To the reading of the will . You won 't get a penny . I changed my will months ago . You son of a bitch . Well , I guess I 'll just have to find me A new man to torture . Dr. Furrier- - That 's ... Hfuhruhurr . I 'm sorry . That 's all right . A lot of people mispronounce it , But it sounds just the way it 's spelled . H-f-u-h-r-u-h-u-r-r . Hfuhruhurr . Hfuhruhurr-rur . That 's good . You just went a little past it there . Just put the brakes on a little sooner . Doctor , I , uh ... I know you were quite shaken By the tragic death of your wife . Oh , I couldn 't talk about it for a long while , But ... Time passes by , and I can handle it now . Her name was rebecca . Why ? ! Why ? ! Why ? ! Why ? ! Is ookims having a massive heart attack ? What a shame , with me so young and hot ! Pom-pom ! Rip her throat out ! Aah ! Why ? ! Why ? ! Why ? ! Why ? ! Why ? ! Why ? ! Dr. Furrier ! Hfuhruhurr ! I 'm sorry . She was ... Everything . Is that her ? No . That 's just a statue of her . Our gardener ramon , he ... He made made that for me after she ... I love the way her head moves . She almost looks ... Alive . Watch out ! Bye-bye ! An angel . Little girl ? Yes , sir ? I want you to do something very important , all right ? Ok . I want you to run home , and I want you to call the e.R. Of north bank general hospital , 9-3-2-one thousand . Tell them to set up o.R. 6 immediately And contact anesthesiologist isadore tourick , 4-7-2-2-1-1-2 , beep 12 . Have them send an ambulance with a paramedic crew , Light I.V. , d-5 and w , kvo . You got it ? E.R. , north bank general hospital , 9-3-2-one thousand . Set up o.R. 6 , Contact anesthesiologist isadore tourick , 4-7-2-2-1-1-2 , beep 12 . Ambulance with paramedics and light I.V. , D-5 and w , kvo . That 's good . Sounds like a subdural hematoma to me . Oh , it does , does it ? Well , it 's not your job to diagnose . But I thought- - You thought ! You thought ! Just go ! 3 years of nursery school , and you think you know it all ! Well , you 're still wet behind the ears . It 's not a subdural hematoma ! It 's epidural ! Hah ! Goddamn , that makes me mad . I don 't find this amusing , garrero ! This is a better story than I ever hoped for . Beautiful woman gets hit by a car And needs brain surgery , and the man who hits her Is the world 's greatest brain surgeon Who operates on her and saves her life . If I save her life , olsen . If . You wanted to see me , dr . Brandon ? Ah , yes , michael . This operation that you 're about to perform , I feel , is very ill-advised . No surgeon should ever operate on a patient That he has personally injured . It would make him too emotionally involved . Don 't you think I 'm aware of that ? But there 's only one other person I 'd trust To perform this operation--beckermann . Dr. Beckermann was murdered in europe . You know that . Exactly ! Not only is he dead , he 's 6,000 miles away . What is that ? it 's a vagina . I know what it is . I mean what are you doing ? Shaving her . This is a brain operation . I know . What 's that supposed to be , a heart ? Yes , sir . Clive and I thought That since it 's valentine 's day that- - You don 't have to shave her anywhere . We 'll be using my cranial screwtop Method of entry into the brain . Fine . Yes , sir . I never want to see that again . I suppose if it were christmas , You 'd hang ornaments on it . Michael : Forceps . Metzenbaum scissors . 10-blade scalpel . Female nurse : 10-blade . Sponge stick . Give me a little sweat on my upper lip . Remove sweat . Cover her breasts . I 'm a man , flesh and blood . Michael : Scat ! Damn ! The cats around here . Cranial screwtop . Now all we can do is wait . Yes . Where am I ? In a hospital . You 've had an accident . Oh . I hope I haven 't caused any trouble . Michael : Oh , no . Dolores : I 'm so tired . Shh shh shh shh . Who are you ? Oh , I 'm--I 'm your doctor . I want- - Oh , don 't- - don 't try and talk . Nurse : Doctor . Huh ? You 're wanted in o.R. 6 in 5 minutes . Thank you . Ohh . Continue the dilantin I.V. What a skull . Ohh . Boy , would I like to jump on those bones . Rebecca . I can 't help comparing her to you . She has a behind so sexy You 'd like to eat lunch off it . Just like we did , remember ? Rebecca . I 've had the top of her head off , But that 's as far as it went . I promise I 'll never recite our favorite poem To anyone but you . In dilman 's grove . In dilman 's grove , my love did die , And now in ground , she 'll ever lie . None could e 'er replace her visage , Until your face Brought thoughts of kissage . Nurse . Good . I 'm glad you 're here . Make a note . Right arm grip strength very good . Left arm 's--there 's just no improvement . Michael : I went out and got you a little present . " the complete poems of john lilyson . " " England 's greatest one-armed poet " ? He wrote in dilman 's grove And pointy birds . I- - " oh , pointy birds , " oh , pointy , pointy , " anoint my head , Anointy , ' nointy . " He died in 1894 . He was the first person ever to be hit by a car . To think you were almost killed by a car . Michael . That 's all over now . That man you ran away from that night ... Poor old mr . Creswell . It was all my fault , in a way . I never should have gone there alone . I guess I 'm just too trusting . Oh , poor little bird . So fragile . So naive . So childlike . So shy . So chaste . So innocent . Rebecca . If there 's anything wrong With my feelings for dolores , Just give me a sign . Rebecca : No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Just any kind of sign . I 'll keep on the lookout for it . Meanwhile , I 'll just put you in the closet . In sickness or in health Till death do you part ? I do . I now pronounce you man and wife . You may kiss the bride . Not now . There it is , darling . Your new home . The house of hfuhruhurr . What are those assholes doing on the porch ? those aren 't assholes . It 's pronounced " azaleas . " I put them there for you . Ramon : Señor . Michael : No , ramon . My wife will not be Entering her new home in a wheelchair . I want this moment to last forever . señor ? Señor , would you like to eat your breakfast now ? Have you taken enough photos of the moment So we can remember this moment forever ? Oh , yes . And we got them back already . See ? Oh , that 's nice . All right , breakfast . We 'll get cleaned up first . One of my favorite people in the world Is about to walk out here . I 'm happy to say he is still busy making his ... Michael : Look , I framed the moment . Mm-hmm . Tv : He 's now about to unveil his latest picture , Which I hear is just amazing , Opening on the 21st of this month- - Yuck . Wait . Turn that back . That 's my favorite movie . That 's donovan 's brain . And not the slightest sign of decay ? None . I 've never seen healthier tissue . It 's growing larger by the day . It 's disgusting . Brains are so ugly . No . It 's beautiful . I 'm late ! Is that all you 're gonna have for breakfast ? It 's all I have time for . How do you feel ? Oh , I 'm fine . I just ... Wish I could get out of this wheelchair So I could help a little around the house . You will . You just had a major operation . It takes time to recover . You 're gonna be up and around in no time . Just be patient . Dolores ? Soon ? Huh ? Huh ? Michael : Forgot my hat . Ooh ! Ohh ! You walked ! You walked ! You walked ! I shouldn 't have gotten up , But I wanted to surprise you And walk into your arms tonight when you came home . You walked ! You walked ! You walked ! I love you so much . Who is that man out there ? Juan . He works for ramon . Oh . He frightened me . He 's just a big , good-natured bag of muscles . There 's just something about him that makes me quiver . Is he here often ? Just one day a week . What day ? Tuesday . Is he ever alone ? I mean , does ramon ever go off and leave him here alone ? Sometimes . Why ? I 'd like to know . Please , tell ramon to warn me When he 's gonna leave me alone with that juan person . All right , if that 'll make you feel better . That 'll make me feel much better . Frightened little mouse . I 'll tell ramon To warn her about juan . Ramon ! Michael , michael , how is married life ? I don 't know ! I 'm sorry . I 've been on edge The last couple of weeks . I don 't know what I 'm doing . Michael ! Aah ! See ? That 's a perfect example . Oh , god , I almost peed in the scrub basin . I don 't know why I 've been so tense . Maybe it 's your coffee . No . When a woman who 's just had major brain surgery Tells you she has a headache , You 've got to listen . Oh . Patience , michael . A recently married woman and an eager young husband- - It won 't be long before you hear her say , " take me ! Take me ! " Dolores : Take me . Take me . Ohh . Ohh , juan . You ... You 're through ! I don 't think I am . Not you . By the way , I fired ramon yesterday . Ramon ? But ramon is such a fine man . What did he do ? He came up behind me , and he grabbed my breasts . What ? I haven 't even done that yet . I know . I told him that . You told him ? He said he had to measure me For a new dashboard ornament . He told me he had to measure rebecca a lot Before he got her right . Oh , you 're upset . So am I. I want to be everything to you rebecca was . I want to give you ... Everything she gave you , Do everything she did . When can you start ? How soon can you get home ? Well , I have 2 operations , but I can do them fast . They 're just brain operations . Let me get my hat . My briefcase . Could you walk me to the door ? What 's he doing ? 2 brain operations at the same time . Number 11-blade . 11-blade . 10-blade scalpel . 10-blade . Ready the bone wax . Metzenbaum scissors . Metzenbaum scissors . Get that cat out of here . Yes , sir . We 're ready to close . Cranial screwtops . Check for stripping . Take them to sicu . Bravo ! Bravo ! You 're so early . Yes . Take off your coat . And your paper hat . I 'm chilling some wine for us . Why don 't you open it ? Yes . Does this do anything for you ? Oh , yes . Good . I want our first night together ... To be exciting . I do , too . I hope the waiting hasn 't been too hard on you . There 's something I have to tell you . This fits very snug , And you may have some trouble getting it off me . You may have to tear it off my body . I can tear . I like tearing . You ... Man of steel . I can 't wait till next Thursday . Today is Monday . I know . But my headache should be gone by then . You don 't mind waiting , do you ? Oh . No . No , no , no . Not at all . I have a little headache myself .

Just as soon as we ... 6 weeks and you haven 't made love to your wife yet ? No wonder you 're tense . Dr. Brandon , the woman has just had major brain surgery . She 's had enough unpleasantness . I 'll have you know that in the finger-sucking department I am extremely satisfied . Have you ever been to austria , michael ? No . The austrian institute of craniology Has asked many times for you to lecture there On your theory of brain transplants . Why not take them up on it ? Combine a business trip with a honeymoon . Honeymoon . Yeah . I got to do something to get us started . When are you scheduled To have your hands removed from your face ? 3 : 00 this afternoon . Then you could do the voitlander surgery for me . Of course ! Have to be very careful with that instant glue . I know . Here 's the voitlander chart . A honeymoon . Yeah . Honeymoon ! May I help you , sir ? Yes , I 'm dr . Hfuhruhurr . I believe you 're holding a room for me . Yes . Would you prefer a double or twin beds ? A double . Ah , a double . Could you send up a bottle of champagne And put a " do not disturb " on the phone For the next- - um , let 's see . We go in , put our bags down start kissing , Be about 7 minutes . Move into the bedroom , slide my hands over her dress , I remove her blouse , maybe 4 or 5 minutes . Move over to the bed , rub each inner thigh , That would be 4 minutes each , So I figure 25 minutes of foreplay in general ... Do you call oral sex foreplay or actual sex ? Doesn 't matter . I 'd like to do it twice , So at least 3 hours , all right ? 3 hours ? ! Yes , sir . Take mrs . Hfuhruhurr and that lucky son of a bitch Up to suite 729 . Yes , sir . I never in my wildest imagination Ever thought it could be like that . It was the most exciting sexual encounter- - Without actually having it- - That I ever almost had . Doctor , I 'm dr . Felix conrad . I 'll be escorting you to the lecture hall . Did you just step off that elevator ? There was no operator . They 're all afraid . You haven 't heard about vienna 's elevator killer ? Elevator killer ? People have been getting on elevators on one floor Only to arrive at another floor dead . Like beckerman . Ja . Dr. Schlermie beckerman . A brilliant brain surgeon . One of your colleagues . It was a great loss . I 'm thankful you 're all right . The academy is looking forward To hearing you lecture this morning . I hope I don 't ruffle any feathers . My speech might be a little radical for the old guard . it would take quite a bit To shock any of this crowd . Ladies and gentlemen , I can envision a day When the brains of brilliant men Can be kept alive in the bodies of dumb people . What are they saying ? They 're just saying " murmur murmur murmur . " It 's just sort of a general murmur ? Yeah . Murmur . Oh . You may murmur all you like- - But to make transplantation possible I have recently invented the cranial screwtop method Of entry into the brain whereby a large section Can be unscrewed without having to shave the head . And as a safety feature , I 've made it childproof . To open , you push down while turning ... And voilá , the human brain . Where is this man 's brain ? Stolen ! It 's the fourth incident this month . I wish to apologize to our american colleague . This demonstration is now concluded . Dr. Hmfhruhrr ? It 's close . Yes ? I 'm dr . Alfred necessiter . Well , well , well . Dr. Alfred necessiter . Would you like a drink ? A drink would be interesting . I enjoyed your lecture today . What lecture ? They gave me a head with 3 lemons in it . That 's why I enjoyed it so much . I didn 't have to hear your brilliant but old-fashioned Theories on the human brain . What do you mean , " old-fashioned " ? I 'm the most advanced brain man working today . I don 't think so . Read this article . Look at the underlined part . And look at this . Read the caption under the photo . And these- - newsweek , time , cosmo . National enquirer- - Dolly parton wants to have my baby . Don 't tell me I 'm old-fashioned . I didn 't mean to upset you , doctor ! You 're the most brilliant brain man working today . That 's why I 'm most anxious to share my work with you . It seems you 're the one person in the entire universe Who might understand it . And I agree with what you said here . " my brilliant research in brain transplantation " is unsurpassed and will probably make my name Live beyond eternity . " I told him to take out the " probably . " My laboratory is set up in my home . If you have a moment , I could show you my work . When ? Now ! All right . I can 't believe they didn 't take out the " probably . " You know , that photograph doesn 't do you justice . Well , hello . I didn 't expect to see you here . Ow ! Oh , you dirty ... Necessiter : What 's the matter ? You 'll have to forgive me . Being in austria and meeting a scientist with your interests , I half expected your laboratory to be in a castle , not a condo . You mean ... Like this ? Yeah . That 's more like it . Jesus . This is extraordinary . From the outside , it does not look this roomy . I had a good decorator . My wife . It 's amazing what she did with a few throw pillows , Some wallpaper , and a staple gun . Leapin ' lizards . Yes . We have those . Moat with alligator ... Here 's our small entrance hall . Do you have enough closet space ? There never is . No . They fill up so fast . This is the tv room . Oh , I love the way it 's so dreary . This , doctor ... Is my laboratory . Brains . I 've never seen so many brains out of their heads before . Feel like a kid in a candy store . Don 't touch it ! Why ? They 're alive . Alive . But there 's no wires or tubes or that " bzz " thing . How are they kept alive ? With a special fluid I developed . Why do you have all these brains ? My vision is to be able to take The thoughts and data from a dying brain And transfer them into another body Without opening the skull . Would you care for a drink ? Please . What would you like ? A tahitian lady . Right-o . Flaming ? Oh , no , no . That 's for tourists . Where do you get your brains ? The city morgue . For a nice tip they send me brains from bodies That have died in the right way . What is the right way for a body to die ? For my purpose , an injection of 200 ccs Of ammoniated strychnoclorahype Into the buttocks , Causing the brain to die last . Thank you . Ammoniated strych- - that 's window cleaner . That 's the exact ingredients in window cleaner . Yes . And who does the injecting , dr . Necessiter , you ? Good lord , no . It 's the elevator killer , bless his heart . You 're condoning murder , aren 't you , dr . Necessiter ? As long at it 's happening , I 'm happy to accept it . The only time we doctors should accept death Is when it 's caused by our own incompetence . Nonsense ! If the murder of 12 innocent people Can save one human life , it would have been worth it . Worth it ? You 're condoning murder ! I 'm not condoning murder , sir ! Woman : Shut up in there ! Research and murder do not go together ! And you shut up ! With your tv blaring all night And your 6 grandchildren running down the halls ! I 'm sorry , doctor . These walls look solid , But they 're thin as tissue paper . That 's typical for a condo . Now , let me show you How far I 've progressed with my experiments . You knew a schlermie beckerman ? You 've got schlermie in one of those jars Like so much marmalade ? No ! He isn 't in a jar ! He 's walking and talking . That 's impossible . I saw photos of the body . It is possible . I must warn you , doctor ... What you are about to see ... Might strike you as the most incredible , awesome- - Excuse me . Incredible , awesome what ? Just a minute . Hello ? Yes ? I 'll be there immediately . Thank you . What was that awesome thing ? I must leave now . I have a new brain to pick . The elevator killer has struck again . What about beckerman and incredible ? Come for dinner tonight and bring mrs . Furrear . Hfuhruhurr . Hfuhruhurr . 8 : 00 . You can let yourself out . Now , if you will just turn around . Und lift your robe . Ja . Michael : Hi . What 's going on ? Don 't interfere . He 's paying me $ 15,000 just to touch my behind . You ! Get outta here ! Please , forgive- - Get out ! This kind of thing could ruin our marriage . Why ? Because you don 't want me to work ? Earn my own money ? Have my own career ? You call this a career ? Oh , I 've made those veins in your temple throb . Oh , I love that . Ha ha ha ! Dolores , our marriage lies broken on the floor Like the shards of glass on our honeymoon suite ! Aah ! Oh ! 19th century indian rubber vase , eh ? Dolores , I am making a citizen 's divorce . What ? By the powers vested in me , I hereby declare our marriage null and void ! E pluribus unum ! Jawohl ? I 'm dr.Hfuhruhurr. Dr. Hfurrrr--oh , ja . You and your wife are expected for dinner . My wife won 't be coming . Oh . I trust she is not ill . She 's not ill . She 's a cheap , vulgar slut ! Ja , I 've heard this . Dr. Hfuhruhurr , please . No , I 'm sorry , he 's not in . This is mrs . Hfurrr ... Ff . I 'm james gladstone , calling from new york . I 'm the attorney For dr . Hfuhruhurr 's step-grandmother . I wanted to inform the doctor of her passing . Passing what ? She was cremated this afternoon . We need the doctor 's signature on some documents Before we release his share of the estate . Um ... How big is the estate ? Rebecca ... Why didn 't you give me a sign ? I miss you . The fun we had . Remember our song ? ¶ if you like-a me ¶ ¶ like I like-a you ¶ ¶ and we like-a both the same ¶ ¶ I like-a say , this very day ¶ ¶ I like-a change your name ¶ ¶ ' cause I love-a you ¶ Woman : ¶ and love-a you true ¶ Both : ¶ and if you would love-a me ¶ ¶ one live as two ¶ ¶ two live as one ¶ ¶ under the bamboo tree ¶ Woman : ¶ and every morning he would be ¶ ¶ down underneath the bamboo tree ¶ ¶ awaiting there his love to see ¶ ¶ and to her he 'd sing ... ¶ ¶ if you like-a me ¶ Both : ¶ like I like-a you ¶ ¶ and we like-a both the same ¶ ¶ I like-a say , this very day .. ¶ Mrs. Necessiter ? ¶ I like-a change your name ¶ ¶ ' cause I love-a you ¶ ¶ and love-a you true ¶ ¶ and if you love-a me ¶ ¶ one live as two ¶ ¶ two live as one ¶ ¶ under the bamboo tree ¶ Hello ? Hello ? Is this a joke ? What ? Is this a joke ? Who are you ? What 's happening ? I don 't know . Who are you ? Dr. Michael hfuhruhurr . Dr. Hfuhruhurr ? My god . What ? You 're the first ... Object that ever pronounced it right . How else could you pronounce it ? H-f-u-h-r-u-h-u-r-r , isn 't it ? Yes ! Who are you ? Anne . Anne uumellmahaye U-u-m-e-l-l-m-a-h-a-y-e ? Uumellmahaye ? Yes . Where am I ? It 's so dark . In a doctor 's laboratory . Am I all right ? Um ... Not really . Will I be able to play the piano again ? Um , I would think--no . Why did you call me an object ? I 'm sorry . I didn 't know what else to call you . Why ? You don 't know ? No , I don 't . Please , tell me . Well ... Miss uumellmahaye , it seems that you have no body . What happened to my body ? It 's dead . Gone . You 're a disembodied brain kept alive by a scientist . But we 're talking . I must at least have lips , a tongue , a throat . Nothing . Just a jar . Oh ! Oh ! Don 't cry . But how can I hear you ? Must be some kind of telepathy . What 's going to happen to me ? Necessiter : Hans told me you were here . Good , good . Now , let me show you That experiment I 've been working on . No ! No . I 've got something more important . Listen , just listen . All right , sing . Anne : ¶ if you like-a me like I like-a you ¶ ¶ and we like-a both the same ¶ ¶ I like-a say ... ¶ Have you heard anything like that in your life ? I can 't hear a thing . Oh , really ? Shh . What were you doing ? I was just working on my new technique For walking in corduroy pants To eliminate the scraping when your thighs rub together . That 's very exciting work , doctor . Now , come on . Let me show you what I 've done For your friend beckerman . Whup . Just one moment . Anne : What happened ? No one can hear you but me . Necessiter : Doctor ! Did you hear that ? No . You can 't hear anyone but me . It is some kind of telepathy . I 'm frightened . Don 't be . Things are never as bad as they seem . You still have your brain . Dr. Hfuhruhurr ! I 'll be back . Just stay here . I believe you know this gentleman . Is that dr . Beckerman ? Sort of . See , I 've devised a machine That can transfer the entire contents of one brain Into another brain . Understand , of course , That the brain of a gorilla is smaller than a human 's , So much of dr . Beckerman 's vast knowledge Couldn 't be accommodated . Dr. Beckerman ? That 's him all right . We never did like to shake hands with him . He must be lonely . Perhaps soon we 'll find him a companion . Come , doctor . Bye . I 'm going up to pack my clothes . Can you send the bellman up in 10 minutes ? Yes , sir . " my darling husband , " by the time you read this I will be dead . " my only regret is that I caused you pain . " I hope my insurance money " brings you some happiness . " may I burn in hell for what I have done to you . " my broken body will be lying " 7 floors below . " au revoir , Dolores . " Dolores : Aah ! No ! You 're alive ! Yes . But the scream ... I was rehearsing . Don 't come near me . Why are you doing this ? Because I 'm evil . You 're not evil . You 're sick . Sick ? Yes , from the operation . Just screw your head on a little bit tighter . You can be well . It 's no use , michael . I 'm no good for you . And , besides , You divorced me . I 'm making a citizen 's annulment . Ipso facto , coitus interruptus . I 'm coming to get you . No ! Stay where you are . I can 't stand hurting you anymore , michael . Good-bye , my darling . No ! Take my hand . You 're safe with me now . Aah ! Put your arms around my neck . I hope this is strong enough for the both of us . Hang on . Uhh ! Michael : Uhh ! I don 't have any more saliva . I need yours . Michael : Uhh ! You 're all right now . Oh ! There . You 're going to the hospital . No , michael , please . I want to make it up to you . When ? Thursday ? How about Monday ?

Anne : help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Dr. Hfuhruhurr . Is dr . Necessiter in ? No , sir . May I wait for him ? Yes . I meant , may I wait inside ? Ja . May I wait in the laboratory ? Oh , I 'm afraid it 's locked , sir , But you are welcome to wait in the den . Make yourself comfortable , sir . Perhaps I could bring you a drink ? Yes . Uh , tahiti tingle . A tingle . And take your time . Ah . Damn . Aah ! Are you all right , sir ? I 'm fine . I 'm fine . I just leaned against the door . The doors in this condo are paper-thin . Everything today is made so cheap . Here , look at this wall- - Like paper . Here is your drink , sir . Thank you . Now can I get you anything else , doctor ? I am about to retire . Really ? You seem so young . No . I mean retire for the night . Oh . Oh , no , thanks , I 'm fine . And don 't worry about this . I 'll have it replaced in the morning . Miss uumellmahaye ? Miss uumellmahaye ? Anne : dr .

Yes , I know , But there is one other alternative- - A human subject . Are you saying you can place her thoughts In another woman 's body ? In the past week , I 've had 2 near successes . What do you mean near successes ? In my recovery room Are 2 subjects who do nothing but this ... But I think I 've solved the problem ! What kind of life would that be ? This is my wife .

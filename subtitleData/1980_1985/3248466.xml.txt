 [ boy ] all right , give me room . here we go . - what 's this game called ? - this is lightcycle . damn ! [ master control program ] you 're getting brutal , sark . brutal and needlessly sadistic . thank you , master control . we 've kidnapped some military programs . i can arrange more lethal matches . interested ? sure . i 'd love to go up against one of those guys . it 'd make a nice break from those accounting cream puffs you keep sending me . what branch of the service ? strategic air command . nice ! hey , look . this is all a mistake . i 'm just a compound interest program . i work at a savings and loan . i can 't play these video games . sure you can , pal . you look like a natural athlete if i ever saw one . who , me ? are you kidding ? i went out to check on t-bill rates , i ran out of breath . hey , look. you guys are gonna make my user , mr. henderson , very angry . he 's a full branch manager . great . another religious nut ! i 'd say , " welcome , friend , " but not here , not like this . i don 't even know what i 'm doing here . do you believe in the users ? yeah , sure . if i don 't have a user , then who wrote me ? that 's what you 're doing here . master control program 's been snapping up all us programs who believe . if he thinks you 're useful , he takes over all your functions so he gets bigger . if he can 't use you , he sends you down here to the game grid get your bits blasted . what 's your name ? crom . i 'm ram . they 'll train you for the games , but ... [ whistles ] i hope you make it . hey , what 's been going on in the other sectors ? i 've been stuck here for 200 microcycles . it 's murder out there . you can 't even travel around in your own microcircuits ... without permission from master control program . i mean , sending me down here to play games . who does he calculate he is ? [ flynn ] okay , clu , tonight we check everything in the right-hand column . come on. come on . where are you ? there you are. clu ? yes , sir . we don 't have much time to find that file . this is top priority . i know , sir . this isn 't correcting my bank statement ... or phone bill problem- - this is a must . i understand . now , i wrote you . yes , sir . i taught you everything about the system . thank you , but- - no buts . that 's for users . you 're the best program that 's ever been written . you 're dogged and relentless , remember ? let me at ' em . that 's the spirit . keep that tank rolling . i 'll try to cover you from this end. go ! you think we can merge with this memory , bit ? yes . hmm . now flynn is saying to look over in here , but i don 't see what we 're looking for . come on , you scuzzy data , be in there. come on . uh-oh ! we 've got company . i don 't believe this . a recognizer . there 's too many ! what is this ? aahh ! damn it ! - get out of here ! - yes-yes-yes . busted again ! god , and that was my best program . got a pirate program here . says his name 's clu . [ master control program ] what did he pull ? he came into the system with a stolen password . we caught him trying to raid our high-clearance memory . no ! i must 've gotten in there by mistake . - [ mcp ] who programmed you ? - i was simp- - aah ! [ mcp ] you 're in trouble , program . make it easy on yourself . who 's your user ? forget it , mr. high and mighty master control . you aren 't making me talk . suit yourself . aah ! [ mcp ] get me dillinger . [ helicopter whirring ] good evening , mr. dillinger . thank you , peter . you can go now . yes , sir . [ master control speaks ] no problem , master c . if you 've seen one consumer electronics show , you 've seen them all . what 's up ? flynn ? yes . he 's still looking for that old file . can 't you just appropriate it ? i have . i put it in my memory , which he hasn 't located . but he might find it . i 'm afraid so . i spotted him this time and kept him out , but he 's getting trickier all the time . i think we should shut down all access ... until we find that flynn , just to be safe . there 's a 68.71 % chance you 're right . cute . come on ! hey , alan . you think i could have some of your popcorn ? yeah , sure . - sit down . - thank you . [ clears throat ] we 've had to shut down all group-7 personnel . just briefly . security . someone with that access has been tampering . i hope you don 't think it 's me . i don 't even balance my checkbook on downtime . - i have an abacus at home for that . - i 'm sure you understand . it 'll only be a couple of days . what 's the project you 're working on ? it 's called tron . it 's a security program itself , actually . it monitors all contacts between our system and other systems . finds anything going on that 's not scheduled , it shuts it down . i sent you a memo on it . part of the master control program ? no , it 'll run independently and watchdog the mcp as well . sounds good . we should have you running in a couple of days. i hope . okay . thanks . oh , boy . [ mcp ] mr. dillinger , i 'm so very disappointed in you . i 'm sorry . i can 't afford to have an independent programmer monitoring me . do you realize how many outside systems i 've gone into ? how many programs i 've appropriated ? come on ! a couple of days . hi , dr. gibbs . well , here goes nothing . yeah , interesting . you hear what you just said ? " here goes nothing . " well , what i meant was- - actually , what we propose to do is to change something into nothing and back again . you might just as well have said , " here goes something , here comes nothing . " right. mm-hmm . [ dr. gibbs ] this is the big moment . i know. this will narrow your theory that the scanned u-v beam ... is superior to single pulse exposure . [ woman on p.a. ] laser activity will exist in 30 seconds . put on your goggles . leave the bay . [ lora ] let 's see if we 've got the green light . - is the target area shielded ? - they verified safety . twenty seconds . looks good . let her rip . this is what we 've been waiting for . ten seconds . - five seconds . - [ machines whirring ] perfect ! [ coworkers clapping ] beautiful ! hi , alan . you two having fun disintegrating things ? not disintegrating , digitizing . a laser dismantles the molecular structure of the object , and molecules remain suspended in the laser beam . then , when the computer plays out the model , ! the molecules fall back into place , and voilaÀÀ great. can it send me to hawaii ? yeah , but you 've got to purchase your program 30 days in advance . how 's it going upstairs ? frustrating . i had tron almost ready ... when dillinger cut everyone with group-7 access out of the system . ever since he got that master control program , the system 's got more bugs than a bait store . you gotta expect some static . after all , computers are just machines . they can 't think . some programs will be thinking soon . [ chuckles ] won 't that be grand ? computers and programs will start thinking , and the people will stop . i 'm gonna stay around , put some data through . see you tomorrow . bye . come on . did you say group-7 access ? yeah . what a hassle . i was all set . did he say why ? something about tampering . tampering ? flynn has been thinking about breaking into the system ever since dillinger canned him . and he had group-7 access . flynn had access to you too . [ lora ] i want to go to flynn 's place . what for ? to warn him . of what ? that dillinger 's onto him . i don 't see why i have to do that guy any favors . i don 't know what you ever saw in that guy , anyway . i loved him for his brains . [ chuckles ] don 't put any change in the meter. we 're gonna need it for the games . boy ! i haven 't been here in a long time . # # # # [ music ] [ chattering ] [ girl ] hey , bobby , up here . where is he ? i don 't know . somewhere in here , lost in one of his games . excuse me . do you know where flynn is ? yeah , he 's over there on his machine . [ boy ] he 's really on a roll ! one more reco before he ties . another reco and he gets the world 's record . [ boy ] he 's going for the record . the all-time record coming up . this is it . it 's all over . flynn 's gonna be a part of history , all right ! hey , flynn , how 'd you do it ? it 's all in the wrists . 999,000 points ! hey , good to see you guys . nothing classes up the joint like a clean-cut young couple . we gotta talk . you can 't hear yourself think in here. come on . come on . i 'll be down in a minute . how 's the world of serious science ? go up ahead . make yourselves at home . be right up . [ chuckles ] the best programmer encom ever saw , and he winds up playing space cowboy in some back room . okay , let me handle this . go right ahead . have you been sneaking into the encom system ? you never were much for small talk , were you ? - she still leave her clothes all over the floor ? - no . - alan ! - i mean , not that often . you can see why all his friends are 14 years old . toucheÉÉ . i have been doing a little hacking , as a matter of fact . - you did break in . - tried to . i can 't seem to quite get the connection with that sucker , though . if i had a direct terminal- - flynn , are you embezzling ? [ game beeping ] embezzling is such an ugly word , mr. bradley . no , actually , i 'm trying to get some solid evidence together . - i don 't get it . - okay . sherman , set the way-back machine for three years ago . kevin flynn , one of encom 's brightest young software engineers . he 's so bright , he starts going in at night , sets up his own private memory file ... and begins writing a program for video games , invented called ... space paranoids . you invented space paranoids ? paranoids , matrix blaster , vice squad- - a whole slew of ' em . i was this close to starting my own little enterprise . but enter another software engineer ; not so young , not so bright , but very , very sneaky ; ed dillinger . one night , our boy flynn , he goes to his terminal , tries to read up his file . i get nothing on there . there 's a big blank . all right , now we take you three months later , dillinger presents encom with five video games ... that he 's invented . the slime didn 't even change the names , man ! he gets a big , fat promotion . thus begins his meteoric rise to- - what is he now ? - executive v.p. ? - senior exec ? senior exec ? meanwhile , kids are putting eight million quarters a week into paranoid machines . i don 't see a dime , except what i squeeze outta here . i still don 't understand why you want to break into the system . because , man , somewhere in one of these memories is the evidence . if i got in far enough i could reconstruct it . my password , dillinger 's instructions to divert the data- - it 's too late for that ! dillinger 's cut off everybody with group-7 access . wait. wait . what are you saying ? the guy knows what you 're up to . great . you 're kidding me ? well , now there is nothing to stop him . it 's just dillinger and the mcp running things from on high now . not if my tron program was running. that 'd shut the system down . you know , if your file was in there- - wait a minute . if we can get in there , i can forge us a group-6 access . well ? shall we dance ? [ dillinger ] i shut down group-7 for a very good reason . ed , all i 'm saying is if our people can 't get access to their programs- - well , you know how frustrating it is when you 're working on a piece of research . i sympathize , but i have data coming from the master control program ... telling me there 's something screwy going on . that mcp , that 's half our problem right there . the mcp is the most efficient way of handling what we do ! i can 't sit here and worry about every little user request that comes in . user requests are what computers are for . doing our business is what computers are for ! encom isn 't the business you started in your garage anymore . we 're building accounts in 30 different countries , new defense systems . we have one of the most sophisticated pieces of equipment in existence . oh , i know all that . sometimes i wish i were back in that garage . that can be arranged , walter . that was uncalled for . you can remove men like alan and me from the system , but we helped create it . and our spirit remains in every program we designed for this computer . walter , it 's getting late . i 've got better things to do ... than to have religious discussions with you . don 't worry about encom anymore . it 's out of your hands now . i don 't think i 'm cleared for this . i 'm certainly not . you wanna move aside ? give the kid a little room . this guy 's a little like santa claus . i make these myself . you want one ? [ flynn ] they never should have gotten rid of me . now that is a big door . shut up . it 's my fault . i programmed you to want too much . [ mcp ] i was planning to hit the pentagon next week . the pentagon ? it shouldn 't be harder than any other big company . but now this is what i get for using humans . wait a minute . i wrote you ! i 've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then . what do you want with the pentagon ? the same thing i want with the kremlin . i 'm bored with corporations . with the information i can access , i can run things 900 to 1,200 times better than any human . if you think you 're superior to us- - you wouldn 't want me to dig up flynn 's file ... and read it up on a v.d.t. at thetimes , would you ? you wouldn 't dare ! hi . hi. working late ? yeah . okay , come here . i 'm gonna put him at my terminal . i 'm gonna meet you in your office upstairs . don 't fall asleep . if and when i activate your tron program , you 'll only have a few minutes to use it before dillinger catches the break in security . as long as we stay off the top floor , dillinger will never know we 've been in here . [ alan ] good luck , hotshot . ahem . flynn ! after you . [ mcp ] keep those programers out of the system , and get me that chinese language file i asked for . end of line . you are going to stick with me ? what for ? you 're the one who never needed help , remember ? come on . i 'm scared of the dark . all this technology scares me . this way ! when did they put this in ? this is where i work . i 've got a direct terminal in the laser target area . you can stay there all night if you have to . like a man says , " there 's no problems , only solutions . " okay , remember , this laser is my life 's work . don 't spill anything . huh ? have fun , sweetheart . hey , it 's the big master control program everybody 's been talking about . [ mcp ] sit right there . make yourself comfortable . remember the time we used to spend playing chess together ? stop ! please . you realize i can 't allow this ? how are you gonna run the universe if you can 't answer a few unsolvable problems ? come on , big fella , let 's see what you 've got . [ mcp ] i 'd like to go against you and see what you 're made of . you don 't look a thing like your pictures . i 'm warning you , you 're entering a big error , flynn . i 'm gonna have to put you on the game grid . games ? you want games ? i 'll give you games . oh , man , this isn 't happening . it only thinks it 's happening . vacate entry port , program . i said , move ! aah ! hey ! look , if this is about those parking tickets , i can explain everything , okay ? prepare all programs for war games . i 've got a little challenge for you , sark ; a new recruit . it 's a tough case , but but i want him treated in the usual manner . train him for the games , let him hope for a while , then blow him away . you got it . i 've been hoping you 'd send me somebody with a little bit of guts . what kind of program is he ? he 's not any kind of program , sark , he 's a user . a user ? that 's right . he pushed me in the real world . somebody pushes me , i push back . so i brought him down here . what 's the matter , sark ? you look nervous . well , i- - i was just- - i don 't know . a user , i mean- - users wrote us . a user even wrote you ! no one user wrote me . i 'm worth millions of their man-years . what if i can 't ? you 'd rather take your chances with me ? want me to slow down your power cycles for you ? wait ! i need that ! then pull yourself together . get this clown trained . i want him in the games until he dies playing . acknowledge . acknowledged , master control . end of line . video game unit 18 . in here , program . who you calling program , program ? new guy ? another free program off-line . you really think the users are still there ? they 'd better be . i don 't wanna bust out of here and find nothing but a lot of cold circuits waiting for me . hey . who are you guys ? hold it ! you wanna watch those force fields . you 'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt . don 't worry about that . look , just so i can tell my friends ... what this dream is about , okay , where am i ? you 're a ... guest of the master control program . oh , great . they 're gonna make you play video games . no sweat . i play video games better than anybody . move out ! this way . you , you come this way . there 's been a mistake . i 've gotta see the guy in charge . you will . [ guard yells , indistinct ] command program sark 's carrier is approaching . he will explain the training procedures . greetings . the master control program has chosen you ... to serve your system on the game grid . those of you who continue to profess a belief in the users ... will receive the standard substandard training , which will result in your eventual elimination . those of you who renounce ... this superstitious and hysterical belief , will be eligible to join the warrior elite ... of the mcp . you will each receive an identity disk . everything you do or learn ... will be imprinted on this disk . if you lose your disk or fail to follow commands , you will be subject to immediate de-resolution . that will be all . [ guard ] move out . hey , who 's that guy ? that 's tron . he fights for the users . tron ? [ flynn ] that 's pretty good . watch this . you gotta be good if you wanna survive . what 's your name ? my name 's ram . hey , ram , what were you , you know , before ? i was an actuarial program . i worked for a big insurance company . really gives you a great feeling ... helping folks plan for their future needs . of course , if you think of the payments as an annuity over the years , the cost is really quite minimal . yeah , that 's great . actuarial program . nice . how about yourself ? oh , i don 't remember too much . name 's flynn . sure , a little disorientation , that 's normal in transport . it 'll come back to you . [ footsteps ] [ ram ] this is it . good luck , flynn . sir , conscript being moved from pit cell to ring game . you know- - hey ! you guys sure are friendly . wait . let him fight one of his own kind . you think you 're gonna wipe me out , don 't you ? no , i- - hey ! i- - the new guy was asking about you . it 's too bad he 's in a match now . i 'll probably never meet him . you might . there 's something different about him . okay . that was a very fancy shot . okay , here 's an easy one . finish the game ! - no ! - kill him . no . you 'll regret this . aah ! [ mcp ] i want him in the games until he dies playing . this is the holding area for the lightcycles . - hey , flynn , you made it ! - wait here . - you won ! - alan . where did you hear that name ? that 's your name , isn 't it ? the name of my user . how did you know ? i 'm a program from a user that knows alan . he was disoriented in transport , tron . but i 'm remembering all kinds of stuff , like my user wants me to go after the mcp . my user wants that too . i know . [ computer voice ] prepare to transport to lightcycle grid . we have transport . wow . blue leader to blue bikes . run these guys into your jet walls . copy , blue leader . copy , blue leader . [ tron ] this is gold-1 to gold-2 and 3 . split up . take them one-on-one . - watch it ! - aah ! taking him into the maze . this is it . come on . gold-3 to gold-2 and 1 . i 'm getting out of here now and you guys are invited . [ ram ] got it . - ready ? - ready . - so long , sucker ! - aah ! greetings , programs ! video game warriors escaping game grid . this is an illegal exit . you must return to game grid . repeat , this is an illegal exit . you must return to the grid . gold-2 to gold-3 . those demons are coming down . get them ! send out every game tank in the grid . get them ! [ flynn ] i should never have written all those tank programs . targets leaving protective field . missed ! all units exiting game arena . target units accelerating ! pursuit force minus one tank . close ranks . oh , man . on the other side of the screen , it all looked so easy . they must 've gone right past us . we made it ... this far . pursuit force reporting . we lost visual contact with escaped units . awaiting further orders . get the pursuit forces back into the canyons. those programs never made it out . we 'll have them back in no time , sir , long before the interrupt interface . we 'd better , null unit . i 'll be lucky if the mcp doesn 't blast me into a dead zone . i want those conscripts ! [ flynn ] what is it ? what do you see ? watch it . watch it . come on , you little bugger . [ ram ] look at that . when do we pay our visit to the old master control ? what ? there 's just three of us . well , if you know anybody who 's got an army for rent , that 's fine , but my user told me to go take that sucker out , or i 'm never getting out of here . we can 'tget to the mcp ... without the help ofmyuser . i have to get to that input / output tower , and communicate with him . well , good . check in with alan . maybe he knows what 's- - what 's that ? that ... is just ... what i need right now . oh , it 's nice . incredible . [ tron ] boy , you forget how good the power feels ... until you get to a pure source . [ laughing ] my friends , my fellow conscripts , we have scored . i feel so much better . pursuit force reporting . no sign of escaped units . moving into next sector . pursuit force reporting . no sign of escaped units . moving into next sector . thank you . i can feel it . feel what ? you okay ? alan-1 . let 's move out ! come on , flynn , put a cork in it . one second ! ahhh ! range , 9 . mark , 45 . 48 degrees . hold it . hold it. fire ! ram , flynn , do you read me ? pursuit force reporting . two escaped units de-rezzed . no ! tron unit heading into next sector . ram ? ram ! come on ! we gotta get outta here ! no sign of life . looks like we got ' em . continue pursuit of remaining conscript . acknowledged. proceeding towards sector frontier . we 're gonna make it , ram . i just gotta find you a place to rest . hang in there , ram . this looks like a good spot . those tanks won 't find us here . okay . i thought this was supposed to be easy . [ groans ] [ beeping ] hey , what 's going on ? you see this ? you shouldn 't be able to do that . now for some real user power . hey , this looks promising . this is just like the old arcade grips . let 's get this show on the road . now we 're smokin ' ! how can you steal a recognizer ? hey , you okay ? you don 't look so good . we 'll get you fixed up . hang on . come here . oh , my user ! users are users . they- - are you a user ? flynn , help tron . ram ! ram ? damn recognizer . thing just goes straight . i gotta get to that i / o tower . program alu , request additional information for sector two . prepare hangar for game simulation transport . attention all units , lock onto matrix code . prepare for digital beam transport . activate hangar doors . what 's the progress on the simulation ? 30 , 56 , 99 are correct . limited four and eight are missing . don 't scream . yori ! 30 , 56 , 99 are correct . limited four and eight are missing . no , i- - tron ! oh ! yori . i knew you 'd escape . they haven 't built a circuit that could hold you . listen ! we have to make plans . where can we go ? this way , quickly . hey ! hold it right there ! yes ? what do you mean , " yes " ? yes . is that all you can say ? no . anything else ? yes . positive and negative , huh ? you 're a bit . yes . where 's your program ? isn 't he gonna miss you ? - no . - i 'm your program . - yes . - another mouth to feed . yes-yes-yes-yes-yes ! watch out for nested macros . who are these weirdos ? inoperative data pushers .

[ warning siren ] [ bit ] no-no-no-no ! aah ! this baby doesn 't handle so good in town . no . what 's this do ? how ' bout this one ? no. no . [ flynn ] here comes a headache . aah ! no-no-no-no ! we gotta stop this thing ! yes ! [ flynn ] i 'm glad you agree ! uh , i 'm fine . no problem . oh , this town is full of live ones . this is where tron said he was going . losing flynn . i don 't believe this . halt ! more guards . they don 't see us . i 'll go first . are you all right ? yeah. let 's do that some more . i think the guard saw me . come on ! halt . dumont . i can 't stand this commotion . what do you want ? i 've come to communicate with my user . difficult proposition . difficult proposition at best . why , i could be de-rezzed just for letting you in here . they hate this tower . they 'd close it down if they dared . they keep me around just in case one of them ... wants to deal with the other world once in a while . dumont ! my user has information that could- - could make this a free system again . [ chuckle ] no , really ! you 'd have programs lined up to use this place , and no mcp looking over your shoulder . when you 've been in the system as long as i have , you hear many promises , many reassurances , many brave plans . please , dumont ! the guards are coming . there they are with the guardian . all right , yori . all right . who is your user , program ? alan-1 . he calls me . may i pass ? all that is visible ... must grow beyond itself , and extend into the realm of the invisible . you may pass , my friend . the tower guardian is helping him . he thinks . bring in the logic probe . [ sark ] more power ! it 's begun . [ alan ] tron , location query . confirm . confirmed , alan-1 . [ alan ] i am creating the information on your disk ... that will erase the mcp and change the system . dedicate yourself to getting the disk into the heart ... of the mcp . this interface is located at its base . we will not be able to communicate again unless you succeed . go ! this is the key to a new order . this code disk means freedom . i think they 're breaking in . thank you , dumont . hurry ! the users are waiting . [ sark ] dumont ? where 's the program ? what program ? take him ! stay close . if i can just get us on the scanning transport beam , this solar sail simulation will take us across the game sea , out of this domain , back into the central computer . look out ! aah ! aah ! commander , you 've enjoyed all the power you 've been given , haven 't you ? i wonder how you 'd take to working in a pocket calculator . we did take care of that user you sent us . incompetent zero . now you 've got two renegade programs ... flying all over the system in a stolen simulation . we 'll get them . it 's only a matter of time . you 've almost reached your decision gate , and i can 't spare you any more time . end of line . - it 's me- - flynn ! - flynn ! - greetings , program . - you 're alive ! barely . yeah , i , uh- - where 's ram ? he didn 't make it . come on . lora . this is flynn . the one who busted me out . lora ? well , then i owe him some thanks . no , it 's , uh , no big deal . i ought to know my way around the lightcycle . i wrote the program . you wrote the program ? it 's time i level with you . - i 'm what you guys call a user . - you 're a user ? i took a wrong turn somewhere . if you are a user , everything you 've done has been according to a plan , right ? [ laughs ] you wish . you guys know what it 's like . you keep doing what it looks like you 're supposed to , no matter how crazy it seems . that 's the way it is for programs , yes . hate to disappoint you , pal , but most of the time , that 's the way it is for users too . stranger and stranger . so , nice-looking ship you got here . what do you want done with the tower guardian- - dumont ? put him with the others ? no , bit brain , prepare him for inquisition . i need a little bit of relaxation . first , rezz up the carrier for pursuit . one other thing . don 't think anymore . i do the thinking around here . [ yori ] this isn 't going to be easy . if those grid bugs get us , we 've had it . had enough ? what do you want ? i 'm busy . busy dying , you worn out excuse for an old program . yes , i 'm old . old enough to remember the mcp when it was a chess program . he started small , and he 'll end small . very funny , dumont . maybe i should keep you around just to make me laugh . what 's happening ? power surge in the mcp . - we have to get off this beam . - i can 't . there isn 't another junction for seven or eight nanoseconds . - there 's another beam ! - it 's too far . he 's creating a junction . did we make it ? yeah . hurray for our side . is he de-rezzing ? no , but i couldn 't tell you why not . i 'm all in one piece . i guess i 'm still with you . [ groans ] tell the guy with the jackhammer to lay off . - how 'd you do that ? - elementary physics- - a beam of energy can always be diverted . are we there yet , mommy ? sark ! dumont ! yori ! tron ? tron 's dead . who 's that ? that is a user , dumont . he came here to help us . tron believed in him . if the users can no longer help us , we 're lost . so , we have erased that program- - no . - you were de-rezzed . - not me , sark . there 's nothing special about you . you 're just an ordinary program . so are you , one that should have been erased . you 're nothing . take that program to the holding pit . please , don 't take- - i 'm taking our friend here ... and some other religious fanatics to master control . when i disembark , this ship and everything that remains on board ... will automatically de-rezz . this means you . move on ! immediate vectors detached . route us to the mcp . i want to get rid of this dead weight , and catch a transport beam to the game domain . these walls- - yori , something 's happening . hey . you all right ? i still have power . sark doesn 't know that . leave me alone . we 've failed . we 're only gonna fail if we give up ! come on , look , the wall ! yori . you brought me back . how ? why did you bring me back ? i need your help . come on ! do something with these controls ! i 'm on it . the mcp , it 's the heart of the whole system . i feel a presence . another warrior is on the mesa . [ tron ] sark ! we 're getting closer . i don 't know how you survived . slave , it doesn 't matter . prepare to terminate . all programs have a desire to be useful . but in moments , you will no longer seek communication ... with each other or your superfluous users . you will each be part of me . together , we will be complete . you should have joined me . we 'd have made a great team . - you 're very persistent . - i 'm also better than you . [ mcp ] sark ? all my functions are now yours. take them . sark ? sark ? look at that ! your user can 't help you now , my little program . i got it . steer us over by the beam . right next to it . what good will that do ? i 'm gonna jump . it 's the only way to help tron . don 't . you 'll be de-rezzed . don 't worry . come on , let 's go ! we did it ! that 's nice . we thought you were dead . where 's flynn ? it was incredible . he threw himself into the beam and distracted the mcp ... just long enough for you to get the disk in . he saved us . he really did it . video warriors , look at the i / o towers . every tower is lighting up . priority one ! [ laughing ] try to look official . here comes the boss . pick me up in an hour . thanks . greetings , programs .

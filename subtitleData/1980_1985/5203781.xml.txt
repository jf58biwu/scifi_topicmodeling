 File A56-7W . Airwolf . Top secret . A Mach 1-plus attack helicopter with the most advanced weapons arsenal in the air . Sought by governments friendly and foreign , Airwolf is hidden somewhere in the western wilderness by its test pilot , Stringfellow Hawke to be returned to the U.S. government only if his brother , Saint John , an MIA in Vietnam , can be found . The deputy director of the intelligence agency that developed Airwolf is Michael Coldsmith-Briggs III , code name Archangel . Believed to covertly provide classified information and support to Hawke in exchange for flying the chopper on missions of national interest . Stringfellow Hawke is 34 , reclusive , sensitive , and a loner . Known to associate with his only friend and mentor , Dominic Santini . Together , Santini and Hawke fly Airwolf . Capable of speeds rivaling the fastest jets and backed by unmatched firepower , Airwolf is a weapon too dangerous to be left in unenlightened hands . Finding Airwolf is your first priority . End of file . ¢ Ü ¢ Ü What 's here is a gift . Talk costs money . I 'll be at the closed-down airstrip over in Crofton in an hour . Come if you 're interested . Saint John . Hello , old stick . Remember me ? Peter MacGregor Moore . How could I ever forget ? Short notice , but I thought you 'd make it . is my brother alive ? Ah ! I said that talk costs money . How much money ? I 'd take a trade . Say , that chopper over there . It 's not mine . Too bad . What about your cabin ? Or maybe this wonderful art collection I 've heard so much about . The years haven 't improved your sense of humor , have they ? Don 't you play with me , Moore . Not about this . I 'll take $ 1,000 to cover my expenses . Agreed . Your brother 's being held in this compound . Weighs about 100 pounds , but he 's basically healthy . His mind is still in good nick . Where ? Quon Ling province , North Vietnam . Off-course weather satellite picked him up purely by chance . Saint John is being held with 1 1 other Caucasians by an ex-NVA colonel named Nuyen Min Giap . Apparently , a man who holds a grudge . Two of his prisoners are ex-Frog Legionnaires dating all the way back to Dien Bien Phu in ' 54 . Poor sods are in their 60s . How 'd you find out about this ? Another mercenary . He occasionally freelances for the Firm . After we picked up the shot , we sent him in to take a closer look . So , the Firm knows all about this ? Wondering why your friend Archangel didn 't tell you ? Don 't be too hard on old Michael . He 's got a task force together , ready for a rescue mission . Trained them personally at Langley so they wouldn 't screw up , like they did in Iran . At the last minute , the State Department pulled the rug from under him . Last I heard , they were negotiating for a release . Now you know as much as I know . I suggest you don 't tip your hand to dear Michael . Don 't you want your money ? I had a brother once . I lost him in Rhodesia a couple of years ago . It 's on the house . Even an old whore like me has a heart buried somewhere . Over here , come on . It 's an artery. lt won 't stop . 10cc 's epinephrine , fast . Piggy-back iv . He 's fibrillating ! Heart paddles . Heart paddles . Stay back . Dr. Greenspan to O.R. Oncology 629 . Oncology 629 . Get him back . You shouldn 't be here . This floor is private . Get lost . Now ! Sorry . I thought you said that elevator was fixed . It just came up here with someone from downstairs . Make sure it doesn 't happen again . Where am I ? You 're in a hospital . You were in a helicopter crash . Wait . How long have I been here ? Shh . Rest now . Doctor Rothchild has been called for . And he 'll answer all your questions when he gets here . What day is this ? It 's Wednesday . I have to make a phone call . I have to call Dom . You will have to wait . It can 't wait . It already has , Mr. Hawke . You 've been comatose for the better part of a year . My name is Dr. Rothchild . I 've been your physician for the past eight-and-a-half months . Your pupils are working like the aperture of an expensive camera . It 's a good sign . What is that thing ? This is an EEG machine . Records the electrical impulses in the brain . It tells us if there 's been any damage done . There 's no chance of ... There 's always a chance when someone 's been comatose for a long time . Do you remember anything of the crash ? Bits and pieces. I ... We think that you had a heart seizure at the controls of your helicopter . Shortly after you arrived here , you went into complete cardiac arrest . So , clinically , you were gone for several minutes . Did a man named , uh , Dominic Santini come to see me ? There 's lots of news that you have to catch up on , Mr. Hawke . It 's best that we move slowly . Doctor , that 's a pretty simple question . Did Dominic come to see me ? Sat in that chair and he talked to you for hours on end . He was convinced you could hear him , even though you didn 't answer . He was a good friend . What do you mean " was " ? Mr. Santini is dead . How ? He and several other men raided a prison camp in North Vietnam that was still holding Americans prisoner . Your brother , Saint John , was among them . He was rescued , but Mr. Santini and another man were killed in the process . Saint John 's here ? Yes . He is on his way back from Alexandria , Virginia . We called him last night when you came to . When was this raid ? Who 's the other man ? The raid was- - was way back in July . The other man was a man named Coldsmith-Briggs . Archangel . He 's been told . What do you mean ? You told him ? Just point-blank ? What else could I do ? He asked me straight out . You were wrong to overload him so quickly . We 're dealing with a year of his life that 's gone . It 's extremely difficult to assimilate . I wish you 'd called me first . If you 're so concerned , Doctor , I suggest you get over there and begin the therapeutic process . Do you agree ? He 's been told . No . He actually took it quite well , considering . He 's very strong . From Great Britain the news of Lady Di 's filing for divorce from Prince Charles has come as quite a shock to both families , as well as society columnists all over the world . Margo , what do you think about that ? Well , who could have predicted it a few months ago ? It seems to me , I recall seeing a tabloid on my market checkout counter that spoke of it being a possibility . I wonder what her settlement will be ? Probably , they will split the crown jewels . Doctor Barr , 377 . Doctor Barr , call 377 . I 'm Dr. Holgate . May I talk with you for a moment ? Yeah . Oh . I see they 've- - they 've given you the articles that they were saving for you . Your emotions must be going in a lot of different directions at the moment . A good friend dead , a brother coming back as if from the dead . A year gone by without being accounted for . You 're a shrink . I wondered when they 'd send you in . You think I 'm standard operating procedure , do you ? For the Firm you are . Huh-huh . That is who 's paying for this , isn 't it ? Huh-huh . What the hell is that stuff they 're giving me ? Just a five-percent-glucose solution . They 'll disconnect it when you start eating solid foods again . And what 's making me so groggy ? Well , you 've been hibernating almost a year . Your metabolism has slowed down to a crawl . Your muscles have atrophied . It 's the same thing up there . Your synapses slow down from lack of use . You feel groggy , logy , punchy . You 'll feel better in time . I 'll come back tomorrow . There is a blue Chevrolet blocking the emergency ambulance entrance . There is a blue Chevrolet blocking the emergency ambulance entrance . I didn 't know they were getting divorced . Yeah , life is unpredictable , isn 't it ? Yeah . This must be your floor . Oh , yeah . Yours , too . Doesn 't go any further . Does if you have a key . Dr. Stevens , Pediatrics . Bye . Bye . Have a nice day . Stringfellow , you have a visitor . Well ? Saint John ? Yeah . You look great . So do you , considering what I saw here three months ago . Press representatives were called to Buckingham Palace yesterday afternoon to hear Her Majesty 's press secretary read a short statement describing what many suspected and what now has been confirmed . : that Prince Charles and Lady Di have called it a day . Parliament has issued a blackout ... Prince Charles and Lady Diana . Sick . What 's the world coming to ? The brothers are getting along famously . I commend you , Dr. Holgate . I could talk to him tonight . Too soon . Why ? For one thing , he 's still terribly groggy . He won 't be able to help you . Reduce his medication a little bit . If I did that , the whole house of cards would come tumbling down . The methods we 're employing are simply not foolproof . You both seem to forget that . Reduce his medication . The longer the delay , the greater the external risk . Now , I want us all on that plane this time tomorrow . You know , it 's funny , but I was confined to a cell maybe a third the size of this room . But I learned to have total freedom in my mind here . I used think through some of the most incredibly detailed projects . I built a house once. lt was , uh ... I cut every two-by-four in my mind , hammered in every nail . It was my dream house . It took me about six months to do that one . A bloody horror . Yeah , but it 's all over now , thanks to your friends . How did Dominic die ? It was quick . The unit had three choppers , two Chinooks and a Cobra for air support . Dom and Archangel were in the Cobra . They took some small-arms fire on the way out , flew about five or six more miles , then went in . No chance they survived ? No . It looked like napalm when they hit the ground . Tired ? Yeah , it 's too good a day . I don 't want it to end . Doctors Levine and Patterson , please pick up your messages . Sorry to interrupt . No , you 're not interrupting . I 'm just leaving . String would like to know when I can , uh , I can take him home . I think in about a week or so . This is Morton Abrams , Mr. Hawke . Do you have the energy to talk to him for a couple of minutes ? I 'll see you tomorrow . I 'll walk with you . Do you mind ? No . I assume you have a pretty good idea where l 'm from . The Firm . Archangel 's replacement . Hmm , not really , just the man who got his job . He was , uh , rather unique . Doctor Levy to admitting . I , uh , have to clear up a few details , such as a piece of U.S. Government hardware . Airwolf . Since you don 't seem to have any further use for it ... Now , if we could clear up this little piece of business now , I could return to Virginia tonight . Do you have a Las Vegas area sectional map ? I can have one in a minute . It 's in the desert , a place called Valley of the Gods . Excellent . That 's excellent . Oncology 629 . Oncology . Stage One is now complete , ladies and gentlemen . I commend you all . Your commendation will be better appreciated in the form of a nice fat check . I 'm sure you 'll be quite well-compensated , Peter . Should I prepare Mr. Hawke for traveling ? Yes , our Libyan friends are dying to meet him again . Shall we begin Stage Two ? Dr. Barr , call 377 . Dr. Barr . Doctor Huggins , please call 617 . Doctor Huggins , please call 617 . Doctor Higgins , please call 617 . Doctor Higgins , please call 617 . Hold still . Hold still . All I want from you is today 's date . Saturday , March 3 . What year ? 1984 . Calluses . Sure are . I wouldn 't have calluses if I 'd been in a coma for a year , would I ? Control to all units , advise that a 407 occurred ... Looks like the vehicle had dual rear wheels . A truck , maybe . Are there any fingerprints other than Hawke 's in the cockpit ? They 're trying to lift some right now . Dom . is that the ship he borrowed ? Yeah . is there any sign of foul play ? No. lt 's completely undamaged . Apparently , it was just landed here . Follow me . There 's something else I want you to see . Who are they ? These three belong to an East German spy organization , Schwartzkrieg . Klaus Kinter , Else Mannheim , Eric Maas . Anastasia Zarkov , Russian . She 's a specialist in things psychological as they apply to the intelligence trade . Over the past couple of years she 's been quite active in behavior-modifying drug research . Peter MacGregor Moore , English . A mercenary who 'll work for anybody with change in their pocket . Right , left , or center , their political persuasion means nothing to him in any way . Well , uh , what 's all these got to do with Stringfellow Hawke ? Two weeks ago , Army Intelligence stumbled onto the fact that this happy group had arrived in the States . Obviously , they were on a mission of some kind . There 's reason to believe that they 're working for Mustapha Kamal . So ? So if you had to speculate , what single thing would Qaddafi like to get his hands on more than anything else in the world ? Come on , quit your kidding , will you ? Airwolf , of course . Exactly . Then Hawke disappears . 24 hours later , we find his helicopter out here in a field in the middle of nowhere . You think he had a run-in with these guys ? I 'd bet on it . Dominic , you know where Airwolf is . You 've got to tell me . Uh-huh . It could fall into the very worst possible hands . I can 't. I gave String my word . Right now , there is no String . He 's been gone over 30 hours . That 's why that chopper is just sitting out there in the middle of nowhere . Well , how do I know this isn 't some kind of fancy scam to get me to tell you where Airwolf is ? Because it doesn 't make any sense . You know what arrangements we have with Hawke . We 're on his side . Well , that was yesterday . What about today ? You people have a funny way of changing sides to suit your needs , you know . Oh- - l resent that . Marella . Marella . Dominic , we 're not just talking about Airwolf . We 're talking about Hawke 's life . You 've got to trust me . I don 't . No . I don 't . Dominic ! I 'm not with them , whoever they are . Maybe . But Saint John is . That doesn 't make any sense . Hematology , 1 1 1 . Hematology , 1 1 1 . Unless ... Unless what ? If you 're lying to me , you 're dead . I 'm not lying . I hope not . Good morning . Else ! There . Who are they ? My brother , Saint John . Which one ? What ? Which one is your brother Saint John ? There are two photos . That 's Saint John . No , these are two different men . Hey , come on . Quick , quick . There never was a crash . They just wanted me to think so . Saint John is not back . What is it ? Brainwashing or something like that ? Something like that . I told them exactly what they wanted me to tell them . What did you tell them ? The location of a very important piece of military hardware . Are they spies ? Do you work for the government or something ? Nothing that patriotic . Hawke here , he works for himself . Himself and the , uh , Firm , I should say . Right , brother dear ? I 'll blow her away . Let 's go . All right , brother . Why not live a little longer ? If you wanted me dead , I 'd already be there . There is a bonus if we get you to Libya alive . I should 've died in that copter crash . There was no crash . Your helicopter was pre-rigged with a radio control device and landed beautifully by MacGregor . What made me pass out ? The photograph I gave you was soaked in a chemical . Nasty chemical . Enters the bloodstream right through the skin . I was wearing gloves , remember ? What about her ? She 's not part of this . Why don 't you let her go ? I don 't think so , Hawke . She might prove too valuable . That 's not going to work . You might as well relax . Harry Houdini did it . Why Libya ? I vacationed there once . You vacationed in Libya ? You think we 'll go nonstop ? No , I got a stopover in Cuba or maybe Nicaragua . I hope it 's Cuba . I always wanted a Caribbean vacation . Do you do things like this everyday ? There ! There it is ! Is that smooth enough for you to set down ? I should think so . Yes . Brace yourselves ! How 'd you like to be untied , Stringfellow ? In exchange for what ? A little flying , just five minutes ' worth . I don 't think so . You can 't shoot me . No one else can get Airwolf out of the lair . You 're right , Hawke . We wouldn 't shoot you . This is bloody awesome . Yeah . Let 's go . That 's what they were after ? All this for a lousy helicopter ? Yeah . How long to reach international waters ? Fifteen minutes to the gulf . Three more and we 're 1 2 miles out . The escort will join us there . Fantastic . Hawke . Relax , brother . Um , why don 't you let me loosen her straps ? We can 't go anywhere now . Then she won 't need her arms free , will she ? Uh , how about you , Freda ? You wanna be a little sympathetic ? You could go back into yours . Not likely . Don 't move or the next word you say could be " goodbye . " Time to call up the escort . So , I didn 't know what to do . So , I , uh , flew out to the Valley and hid in Airwolf and I waited . How long were you going to wait ? Long as it took . Now what ? Well , looks like we 're gonna miss our Mediterranean vacation . It is the tourist season . Here they come . Damn it , we did it . Rear cargo doors. lt could be trouble . I 'll go take a look . Release the drag chute . Engage both engines . Both at once ? Now ! Cut the chute away . We 've have some MiGs on our tail . Pop a Sun Burst . No ! Where 's that other MiG ? They 're heading home . They 've had it ! That makes two of us . Let 's go home . You don 't have a home of your own ? Of course we do . And offices in a half-dozen locations . Then how come you 're always here ? You flew in with Dom . Didn 't he tell you that we found your helicopter in the desert ? Yeah . Well ? Well what ? Well , what happened ? Did the Schwartzkrieg grab you ? Did they get Airwolf ? I mean , is it safe ? Are they still in the country ? I don 't know . Yes . No. ln that order . Good . How 'd you get away ? He dumped his helicopter out of the back of a cargo plane . You had a civilian with you ? I 'm no civilian , I 'm a nurse . Susan helped me escape . So she knows where Airwolf is hidden ? is that what you call his helicopter ? We didn 't tell her the name . We thought we 'd keep that from her . So , she knows where it is ? Sorta . Sorta ? Well ... Should I tell him ? I don 't think so . You 're right , String . Michael 's such a blabbermouth . This isn 't humorous . Oh . Hey , look. I really don 't know . I saw a lot of snow and a lot of scenery and it all went by very fast . Besides , I was asleep when we landed . Thank God . Sorta .

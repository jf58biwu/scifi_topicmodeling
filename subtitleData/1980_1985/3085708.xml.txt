Now answer as quickly as you can . Sure . 1 187 Hunterwasser . That 's the hotel . What ? Where I live . Nice place ? Yeah , sure , I guess . Is that part of the test ? No . Just warming up . That 's all . It 's not fancy or anything . You 're in a desert walking along in the sand when all of a sud- - Is this the test , now ? Yes . You 're in a desert , walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down- - What one ? What desert ? Doesn 't make any difference what desert . It 's completely hypothetical . - But how come I 'd be there ? - Maybe you 're fed up , maybe you want to be by yourself . Who knows ? You look down and you see a tortoise , Leon . - It 's crawling towards you- - - A tortoise ? What 's that ? - You know what a turtle is ? - Of course . Same thing . I 've never seen a turtle . But I understand what you mean . You reach down and you flip the tortoise over on its back , Leon . Do you make up these questions , Mr. Holden ? Or do they write them down for you ? The tortoise lays on its back , its belly baking in the hot sun beating its legs , trying to turn itself over , but it can 't . Not without your help . But you 're not helping . What do you mean I 'm not helping ? I mean , you 're not helping . Why is that , Leon ? They 're just questions , Leon . In answer to your query , they 're written down for me . It 's a test designed to provoke an emotional response . Shall we continue ? Describe , in single words , only the good things that come into your mind about your mother . - My mother ? - Yeah . Let me tell you about my mother . A new life awaits you in the Off-world colonies . The chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure . A new life awaits you in the Off-world colonies . The chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure . Let 's go to the colonies . This announcement has been brought to you by the Shimago-Dominguez Corp. Helping America into the new world . Give me four . No . Four . Two , two , four . And noodles ! He say you 're under arrest , Mr. Deckard . Got the wrong guy , pal . He say you " Blade Runner . " Tell him I 'm eating ! Captain Bryant ... . Bryant ? Now on glide path . Mark course , over the landing threshold . - Hiya , Deck . - Bryant . You wouldn 't have come if I just asked you to . Sit down , pal . Come on , don 't be an asshole , Deckard . I 've got four skin-jobs walking the streets . They jumped the shuttle Off-world . Killed the crew and passengers . We found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks ago so we know they 're around . Embarrassing . No . Not embarrassing because no one 's ever going to find out they 're down here . 'Cause you 're gonna spot them and you 're gonna air ' em out . I don 't work here anymore . Give it to Holden . He 's good . I did . He can breathe okay , as long as nobody unplugs him . He 's not good enough . Not as good as you . I need you , Deck . This is a bad one . The worst yet . I need the old Blade Runner . I need your magic . I was quit when I come in here , Bryant . I 'm twice as quit now . Stop right where you are ! You know the score , pal . You 're not cop , you 're little people . No choice ? No choice , pal . I already had an IQ test this year . I don 't think I 've ever had one of these . Reaction time is a factor in this , so please , pay attention . - Now answer as quickly as you can . - Yeah , sure . 1 187 Hunterwasser . - That 's the hotel . - What ? Where I live . Nice place ? Yeah , sure , I guess . There was an escape from the Off-world colonies two weeks ago . Six Replicants : three male , three female . They slaughtered 23 people and jumped a shuttle . An aerial patrol spotted the ship off the coast . No crew , no sight of them . Three nights ago they tried to break into the Tyrell Corporation . One of them got fried running through an electrical field . We lost the others . On the possibility they might try to infiltrate as employees I had Holden go over and run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers . Looks like he got himself one . So you look down and you see a tortoise ; it 's crawling towards you . A tortoise ? What 's that ? - Know what a turtle is ? - Of course . Same thing . I 've never seen a turtle . I don 't get it . Why do they risk coming back to earth for ? What do they want out of the Tyrell Corporation ? Now you tell me , pal . That 's what you 're here for . - What 's this ? - Nexus 6 . Roy Batty . Incept date , 2016 . Combat model . Optimum self-sufficiency . Probably the leader . This is Zhora . She 's trained for an Off-world kick murder squad . Talk about Beauty and the Beast . She 's both . The fourth skin-job is Pris . A basic pleasure model . A standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies . They were designed to copy humans in every way , except their emotions . But the designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own emotional responses . Oh , hate , love , fear , anger , envy . So they built in a fail-safe device . Which is what ? Four-year life span . Now there 's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation . I want you to go put the machine on it . And if the machine doesn 't work ? Do you like our owl ? It 's artificial ? Of course , it is . Must be expensive . Very . I 'm Rachael . Deckard . It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public . Replicants are like any other machine . They 're either a benefit or a hazard . If they 're a benefit , it 's not my problem . May I ask you a personal question ? Sure . Have you ever retired a human by mistake ? No . But in your position , that is a risk . Is this to be an empathy test ? Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response ? Fluctuation of the pupil . Involuntary dilation of the iris . We call it Voight-Kampff for short . Mr. Deckard , Dr. Eldon Tyrell . Demonstrate it . I want to see it work . Where 's the subject ? I want to see it work on a person . I want to see a negative , before I provide you with a positive . What 's that gonna prove ? Indulge me . On you ? Try her . It 's too bright in here . Do you mind if I smoke ? It won 't affect the test . All right . I 'm gonna ask you a series of questions . Just relax and answer them as simply as you can . It 's your birthday . Someone gives you a calfskin wallet . I wouldn 't accept it . I 'd report the person who gave it to me to the police . You 've got a little boy . He shows you his butterfly collection plus the killing jar . I 'd take him to the doctor . You 're watching television . Suddenly you realize there 's a wasp crawling on your arm . I 'd kill it . You 're reading a magazine . You come across a full-page nude photo of a girl . Is this testing whether I 'm a Replicant or a lesbian , Mr. Deckard ? Just answer the questions , please . You show it to your husband . He likes it so much he hangs it in your bedroom . I wouldn 't let him . Why not ? I should be enough for him . One more question . You 're watching a stage play , a banquet is in progress . The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters . The entr√©e consists of boiled dog . Would you step out for a few moments , Rachael ? Thank you . She 's a Replicant , isn 't she ? I 'm impressed . How many questions does it usually take to spot one ? I don 't get it , Tyrell . How many questions ? Twenty , thirty , cross-referenced . It took more than a hundred for Rachael , didn 't it ? She doesn 't know ? She 's beginning to suspect , I think . Suspect ! How can it not know what it is ? Commerce is our goal here at Tyrell . " More human than human " is our motto . Rachael is an experiment . Nothing more . We began to recognize in them a strange obsession . After all , they are emotionally inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the experiences which you and I take for granted . If we gift them with a past , we create a cushion or a pillow for their emotions and consequently we can control them better . Memories . You 're talking about memories ! Reaction time is a factor in this , so please , pay attention . - Now answer as quickly as you can . - Sure . 1 187 Hunterwasser . - That 's the hotel . - What ? - Where I live . - Nice place ? Yeah sure , I guess . Is that part of the test ? No . Time ? Enough . Did you get your precious photos ? Someone was there . Men ? Policemen ? " Fiery the angels fell ... " ... deep thunder roared around their shores ... " ... burning with the fires of Orc . " You not come here ! Illegal ! Cold ! Those are my eyes ! Freezing ! Questions . Morphology ? Longevity ? Incept dates ? Don 't know . I don 't know such stuff . I just do eyes . Just eyes . Just genetic design . Just eyes . You Nexus ? I designed your eyes . If only you could see what I 've seen with your eyes . Now questions . I don 't know answers . Who does ? Tyrell ! He knows everything . Tyrell Corporation ? He big boss . Big genius . He design your mind . Your brain . Smart . Very cold . Not an easy man to see ... Very cold . ... I guess ? Sebastian . He take you there . He take you there . Sebastian who ? J.F. Sebast- - Now where would we find this J.F. Sebastian ? Let 's continue , shall we ? Describe , in single words only the good things that come into your mind about your mother . - My mother ? - Yeah . I 'll tell you about my mother . Voice print identification . Your floor number , please . - Deckard , 97 . - 97 . Thank you . I wanted to see you . So I waited . Let me help you . What do I need help for ? I don 't know why he told you what he did . Talk to him . He wouldn 't see me . You want a drink ? You think I 'm a Replicant , don 't you ? Look . It 's me with my mother . Yeah ? Remember when you were six ? You and your brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window . You were gonna play doctor ? He showed you his , and when it got to be your turn , you chickened and ran . Remember that ? Did you ever tell anybody that ? Your mother ? Tyrell ? Anybody ? You remember the spider that lived in the bush outside your window ? Orange body , green legs ? Watched her build a web all summer ? Then one day , there 's a big egg in it . The egg hatched ... . - The egg hatched ... - And ? ... and a hundred baby spiders came out . And they ate her . Implants . Those aren 't your memories ! They 're somebody else 's . They 're Tyrell 's niece 's . Okay . Bad joke . I made a bad joke . You 're not a Replicant . Go home . Okay ? No , really . I 'm sorry . Go home . Want a drink ? I 'll get you a drink . I 'll get a glass . You forgot your bag . I 'm lost . Don 't worry , I won 't hurt you . What 's your name ? Pris . Mine 's J.F. Sebastian . - Hi . - Hi . Oh , where were you going ? Home ? I don 't have one . We scared each other pretty good , didn 't we ? We sure did . I 'm hungry , J.F. I 've got stuff inside . Do you wanna come in ? I was hoping you 'd say that . Do you live in this building all by yourself ? Yeah , I live here pretty much alone right now . No housing shortage around here . Plenty of room for everybody . Watch out for the water . You must get lonely here , J.F. Not really . I make friends . They 're toys . My friends are toys . I make them . It 's a hobby . I 'm a genetic designer . Do you know what that is ? No . Ma 'am ? Yoo-hoo , home again ! Home again , home again , jiggidy-jig . Good evening , J.F. ! Evening , fellas . They 're my friends . I made them . Where are your folks ? I 'm sort of an orphan . What about your friends ? I have some , but I have to find them . I 'll let them know where I am tomorrow .

Taffey Lewis ' . Down in the Fourth Sector . Chinatown . Bartender . Taffey Lewis ? Taffey . I 'd like to ask you a few questions . Blow . Do you ever buy any snakes from the Egyptian , Taffey ? All the time , pal . Did you ever see this girl ? Never seen her . Buzz off . Your licenses in order , pal ? Hey , Louie . The man is dry . Give him one on the house , okay ? See ya . Hello ? I 've had people walk out on me before , but not when I was being so charming . I 'm in a bar , here now , down in the Fourth Sector . Taffey Lewis ' on the line . Why don 't you come down here and have a drink ? I don 't think so , Mr. Deckard . That 's not my kind of place . Go someplace else ? Ladies and gentlemen Taffey Lewis presents Miss Salome and the snake . Watch her take the pleasure from the serpent that once corrupted Man ! Excuse me , Miss Salome , can I talk to you for a minute ? I 'm from the American Federation of Variety Artists . Oh yeah ? I 'm not here to make you join . No , ma 'am . That 's not my department . Actually I 'm from the Confidential Committee on Moral Abuses . Committee of Moral Abuses ? There 's been some reports that the management has been taking liberties with the artists in this place . I don 't know nothin ' about it . Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way ? How do you mean , " exploited " ? Well , like to get this job .

 'The year is 1987 'and NASA launches the last of America 's deep-space probes . 'In a freak mishap , Ranger 3 and its pilot , Captain William " Buck " Rogers 'are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life-support systems 'and returns Buck Rogers to Earth 500 years later . ' - I can 't get over how you 've grown , Maya . - I 'm not that old , Vione . Old enough to turn the head of every young man in Gaan . The Trebor has asked for Maya . No ! My father will never allow this . Prime Minister Darius ? What will he do ? He 's just like the rest of the Katarians , helpless and weak . Vione ! Vione ! We must do something ! What can we do against the Trebor ? He controls us with military power , secret police . He 's taken dozens of our women to add to his harem . He regularly murders our best warriors for sport . The people are terrified . They never resist . Without their support , we are helpless . Darius , if the people had someone greater than the Trebor to believe in ... - Greater than the Trebor ? - Yes , I 'm speaking of the Roshon . The Roshon 's a myth , Neil . The 500-year-old man who 's going to save us from the Trebor ? A childhood fable ! Which many of our people still believe in . Darius , there is a Terran named Buck Rogers . He is said to be 500 years old . We need more than myths to defeat the Trebor . Rogers is no myth . His age can be validated . - Impossible . - We could bring him to Katar , present him to the people . The people need someone to rally them , to give them faith in themselves . To move against the Trebor ? Darius , you can 't take this foolishness seriously . It 's more than we have now , Kelan . I 'm ready to leave for Earth immediately , sir . If the Trebor finds out about this , his reaction could be very unfavourable . We have nothing to lose . - Last one to the hangar is a rotten egg . - A what ? You know , an egg , Wilma . It 's white , kind of round . Chickens lay them . Ah , well , forget it . - I guess you had to be there . - I 'm sorry I missed it . Do you see what I see , at about two o 'clock ? - That guy 's in trouble . - Yeah , and badly outnumbered . This is Colonel Deering of the Earth Defense Directorate . 'You are violating Terran airspace . Identify yourselves . ' - They 're not talkers . Let 's give him a hand . - I 'm right behind you , Buck . Take the one on the right . I 'll take the other one . This is Deputy Minister Neil , of Katar . Thanks . It 's our pleasure . Captain Rogers and Colonel Deering here . - Glad we could be of assistance . - ( Wilma ) ' You 've sustained damage . ' I guess I have . We 're on our way to Earth . We 'll escort you and see about fixing your ship . I 'll follow you in . We still haven 't determined the origin of those fighters . Any ideas ? - Pirates , I suppose . - More than likely . Please be seated . I wish there was some way I could repay you . Both of you . - That 's not really necessary . - I have an idea . Dr Huer has offered me transport to Katar . Come with me . You and Colonel Deering . Be my guests for a few days in Gaan . - It 's an exquisite city . - I 'd love to , but I couldn 't possibly get away . Thank you . Captain , it would be a great privilege . - Well , I 've never been to the 13th quadrant . - Then it 's decided . Bidibidibidibidi . I 'll go get us packed , Buck . Twiki , your manners are showing , I 'm afraid . I 'm not sure this is a weekend for two . Of course he can come . My people would find him enchanting . Bidibidibidibidi . Naturally . ( Laughing ) Thank you , Colonel , for your help . - Doctor . - Safe trip , Deputy Minister . Captain Rogers , Darius , Prime Minister of Katar , and Deputy Minister Kelan . And my daughter , Vione . - Captain Rogers , we owe you our thanks . - It was no big deal , really . You 're too modest , Captain . Your reputation has reached even the 13th quadrant . It has ? Bidibidibidibidi . A legend in your own time . And ours . I suppose we might as well get right to the point . - And what point is that ? - The reason we brought you here . Bidibidibidibidi . Uh-oh . Brought me here ? Prepare the combat area for broadcast . Oh , Maya ! Maya , welcome . You 're just in time , my darling . I shall dedicate this contest to you . Please , make yourself comfortable . Yeah . Yes ! - Neil reached Earth . - He survived ? And returned with the Terran named Buck Rogers , a man born in the 20th century . Oh , yes . Darius cleverly resurrected an ancient myth that a 500-year-old man would duel the Trebor to the death and free the planet . ( Laughing ) People believe in the Roshon . Greta , the Roshon does not exist . However , if this Buck Rogers is giving them a false sense of courage , well , then , he 's a nuisance and he should be removed . Gentlemen , I have a job for you in Gaan . Look , I am not your Roshon , or whatever it is you call it . I 'm just me , Buck Rogers . All we ask is that you appear to be the Roshon . Long enough for the people to find the courage to stand up to the Trebor . I can 't give your people courage , or direction . They 've got to find that for themselves , can 't you see ? - The captain 's right , Darius . - But the people can 't do it . - Not alone . They need help . - Why ? This is their planet . I don 't understand . 'People of Katar , attention ! 'The contest is about to begin . ' This will help you understand why . Once monthly , the Trebor selects one soldier to fight to the death . The " contest " is broadcast across the entire planet . - Doesn 't anyone ever say no ? - Acceptance is mandatory . It is the duel or summary execution . It has taken the cream of our officer corps . Begin , Katarian . ( Pulsing ) - He is impressive . - We need your help , Captain . - Without it ... - Captain , we cannot make you do anything , but please , think about this . I 'm still not sure what I can do . It is late . Vione will show you to your quarters . We can talk tomorrow . Bidibidibidibidi . That doesn 't look like the welcome wagon , Buck . Are you all right , Captain ? I 'm fine . Just not impressed with Katarian hospitality . Those were assassins sent by the Trebor . - Assassins ? For me ? - The Trebor has learned of your arrival . What a nice welcome ! Remind me to send him a thank you note . ( Woman sobbing ) Bidibidi . What 's the matter , Buck ? - Vione , what 's wrong ? - It 's Maya , my younger sister . - The Trebor 's men took her to him . - What for ? The Trebor has many wives . He keeps them in the palace with him . He 's going to force Maya to marry him . I 'm so afraid we 'll never see her again . Captain Rogers , our people have to fight the Trebor , destroy him . We need your help to get started . All right , I 'll see what I can do . Buck ! Thank you . - I haven 't done anything yet . - Yes , you have . You 're so different from the men I 've known . - What are you doing ? - Getting a little help from my friends . How 's your vacation going , Buck ? 'It 's going to be a lot of work . ' - Oh , really ? How so ? - ' I 'll fill you in later . ' - ' Right now , I need information . ' - On what ? 'A guy called a Trebor . He 's a shogun up here , a dictator . ' Yes , what about him ? 'Get me anything you can , especially about what he does with electricity . ' Electricity ? That hasn 't been used in over 400 years , Buck . 'Wrong , Doc . This Trebor is using it here in Katar . ' - Are you all right , Buck ? - ' So far . 'Get back to me as quickly as possible . ' - Yes , of course . Be careful . - ' Don 't worry , Doc . I intend to be . 'Rogers out . ' - The Trebor ? - Yes , I 've never heard of him . - I 'd better check this out at the archives . - Good idea . Maya , how do you like your new home , girl ? This isn 't a home . It 's a prison . Come , come . It 's a privilege to be here . Not for me . Maya ! You 're to be my bride in a matter of days . I 'd rather be dead . Well , that is an alternative . Don 't be foolish , girl . No one can help you here . You are mine , girl . And it can be quite enjoyable . Take her to the women 's quarters . You 've decided to help us ? That 's wonderful news . We should present you to the people soon . That 's fine , but it 's just talk . What we need is action . - What do you have in mind ? - A lightning raid on the Trebor 's palace . Supply me with a handful of your best men , show me a way in , we 'll free your women and then we 'll go after the Trebor . That 's ridiculous ! - But bold . - And imaginative ! The last thing the Trebor would expect ! - It 's a suicide mission . - Suicide , Kelan ? Our daughters are experiencing a living death right now . The system of secret conduits under that palace could be our entrance . All right . I 'll need transport , weapons and a schematic of the palace . - I 'll get them immediately . - Bidibidi . Looks like all systems are go . Hello ? Dr Junius ? Anybody here ? ( Man ) Dr Junius is out . I 'm in . Dr Albert . Oh ! An early model hand laser . We haven 't figured out how it works yet . Dr Albert , I spoke with Dr Junius earlier this morning , about a man called the Trebor . Trebor ? Trebor ? Trebor ... Oh , yes , yes ! Junius left the information here somewhere . Trebor ... Trebor ... Oh , here it is . I got it . Uh ... What does it say ? Your Trebor is the warlord on a planet called Katar , in the 13th quadrant . He 's the 17th Trebor to rule over Katar . Go on , what else does it say ? Oh . This is rather extraordinary . It seems he spent several years on a planet called Volton . - Volton ? I ... - Yes . He lived among a race of beings who existed only as electrical energy . Yes , Buck mentioned electricity . When he was there , he had minute electronic circuitry implanted under his skin . He 's capable of creating enormous amounts of electrical power , and directing it . What do you mean by directing it ? Well , your Trebor is able to hurl an electrical charge , a surge . He 's been known to use it as a very effective weapon . It 's considered to be quite dangerous , in fact , even deadly . Thank you , thank you . - Where are the men ? - At the shuttle . - We 'll land some distance from the palace . - We don 't anticipate a problem with guards . - Twiki , wait for me back at my quarters . - Bidibidi . OK , Buck , but don 't be too long . Stay near the Comms Centre , Kelan . In an emergency , contact us . Of course , Darius . Safe journey . 'Central Communications . Yes , Deputy Minister ? ' My vidfon . I 'm getting nothing but static . 'It 's not the vidfon , sir . The static is due to violent sunspot activity on Solon . ' I must complete this transmission . 'Our data indicates the storm should be lessening in one hour . 'Normal communications will be possible then . ' The women 's chamber is this way . The way to the Trebor 's quarters is to the left . - You 'll see a conduit on your right . - I saw the schematic . We 'll meet back at the ship . - Come on . - Good luck . ( Ticking ) ( Smack ) You guys just threw snake eyes ! That 's the emergency access to the women 's quarters . I can see the door . It 's clear . You stay here and keep an eye on things . - Father ! - Maya . You 're safe . I hate to break this up but we 've got to get back to the shuttle . Where is the Trebor ? It 's imperative that I talk to him . That 's impossible . I have strict orders not to ... 'Darius and Rogers have brought a combat team into the palace . 'They plan to kill him and take the women . ' Don 't move , Trebor ! You fool ! You forget where you are , and who you 're dealing with . Kill him , Minister ! No , we 're taking the Trebor to Gaan to stand trial , let the people see that he 's mortal . ( Pulsing ) - Rogers is somewhere on the grounds . - Search the complex . Greta , you come with me . I want to check the women 's quarters . Stay with them , Darius . I 'm going back for Neil and the others . That 's all , Captain Rogers . Neil , the women are inside . Where are the others ? - Stunned . All four are wounded . - And Buck ? He was coming after you . - I don 't know where he went . - I can 't leave Buck . He didn 't ask for this . - Take the controls . - You 'll be stranded . If Buck 's alive , we 'll get out . Now , do as I say , quickly ! Come on . So this is the indestructible Roshon . The warrior who was to free Darius and his rabble from the tyranny of the Trebor ? ( Laughing ) You didn 't meet with much success on your first campaign , did you ? Let me see ... Four wounded officers and Neil is probably captured by now , too . - At least Darius escaped with the women . - Yes , and he 'll die for it , too . Oh , it will be enjoyable ! To start over again with the cream of Gaan 's maidens . Greta , what should we do with him ? If he 's the Roshon , then he must fight the Trebor . Why , of course ! Of course . A duel to the death . Does that appeal to you , Roshon ? Not particularly , no . Call Kelan . Alert him . Tell him I 'll be bringing their hero to Gaan tomorrow . This little adventure of yours could prove to be a harsh lesson for Darius and the people , and , most of all , for you . Place him in a cell until we are ready to leave . - Where 's Father ? - He stayed behind . They couldn 't find Buck . Bidibidibidibidi . Oh , boy ! Buck 's missing . I 'm sure they 'll be all right . Really , I am . - Thanks . - Quick , I know where we can steal a ship . - Do you always travel with Buck ? - Bidibidibidibidi . He 'd be lost without me . Maya ! Vione ! - Oh , Father ! - Boy , am I glad to see you , Buck . Took the words right out of my mouth . How will I ever be able to thank you for saving Maya ? I think we 're even . Your father saved my skin back there . That 's between my father and you . Darius , Captain Rogers . I can 't tell you how we worried . I 'm sorry you won 't have a chance . Take the Minister to his quarters . He 's under arrest . You can 't resist the Trebor . Don 't you see that ? - Neil and the women , are they safe ? - Neil 's badly wounded but he 's going to live . - The women are fine . - The Trebor will be following us . More specifically , the Roshon . Me . He 'll do everything he can to set the odds in his favour . Karem and the secret police will help him . We 've got to find a place where I can face him and we can cover ourselves . The hangar . It 's big and it 's close . He 'll have to go through it . Let 's take a look at it . Ladies . They are going to pay for this , all of them ! Get me Karem ! This Buck Rogers , the Roshon . Most of all , I want him . He 's going to die . But not easily . And not quickly . - Where will the Trebor enter from ? - Over there , at the far end . The first thing he 's going to see is the Roshon . Buck , the Trebor 's a deadly killer . Are you sure you want to meet him alone ? That 's what it 's gonna boil down to , isn 't it ? The Trebor against me . Besides , if it doesn 't work out , you can take over . I 've seen enough . Let 's go . Buck , it 's your friends on Earth . - Doc ! Where have you been ? - ' We haven 't been able to get through . ' What have you come up with ? 'The Trebor has some kind of circuitry implanted under his skin . 'It produces an enormous amount of electricity . 'You 're more familiar with it than we are . ' I 've got a good idea how it works . 'He uses it to create a " surge " , and then he directs it through his hand . - ' It 's quite deadly . ' - I know . I 've seen it in action . 'What exactly are you doing ? ' Doc , when we 've got time , I 'll be glad to sit down and talk about it . - Right now , let 's just say I 'm helping . - ' This Trebor sounds dangerous . ' - Yes , he is , Doc . - ' Need help ? We could send a squadron . ' Not right now , there 's not enough time . Thanks , anyway . I 'll be talking to you . Twiki , you and I are gonna have a little talk . Bidibidibidibidi . Your place or mine ? The Raven is waiting . I 'm ready . Bidibidibidibidi . You 're giving me heartburn , Buck . - It 's just an improvised transformer . - What 's it for ? We can use this to give the Trebor a taste of his own medicine . That 's great , but why me ? You 're better equipped to handle electricity than I am . Besides , this transformer will help take some of the sting out of it . - Vione , what is it ? - The Trebor 's on the scanner . They 'll be here in minutes . Bidibidibidibidi . I 'll catch you later , Buck . Thank you for everything . It seems like I 'm always standing here , thanking you . Don 't stop on my account . I brought you something . It 's beautiful . In the past , our women gave their men medallions before going into battle . They were always worn close to the heart . For protection and strength ... and love . - Vione ... - Wear this close to your heart , Buck . May my love protect you and give you strength . Always . 'A Situation Red Alert is now in effect ! Situation Red ! ' - All set ? - Yes . I 've got my best men at this end of the hangar . They are prepared to fight . - What about the Trebor ? - He should be here any ... ( Trebor ) Roshon ! Roshon ! The Trebor is here ! - Bidibidibidibidi . Goodbye , Buck . - Twiki ! - For victory , Captain . - Long life , Darius . - Are you ready , Twiki ? - Bidibidibidibidi . As ready as I 'll ever be . Let 's go . You came to me , Roshon . I thought I would repay the compliment . I didn 't think manners was your strong point . Laser rifles , Roshon ? Why not be more sporting ? - As you see , I am unarmed . - In a manner of speaking . You wouldn 't shoot an unarmed man , would you , Roshon ? By me , Twiki . Fast ! Stop ! No one kills the Roshon ... but the Trebor . Stay close and be ready , Twiki . Bidibidibidibidi . Be careful , Buck . Roshon ! Drop your weapon . Face me like a man . I repeat , I 'm unarmed . Except for that power plant you 're wired with . I could have killed you just then but I want you to last a while . Twiki , get over here . What is that ? My ambuquad , Twiki . We do everything together . - Even die ? - We haven 't tried that yet . No . No , of course not . You 're the man who has lived 500 years ... and is about to die in seconds . - Get ready , Twiki . - Bidibidibidibidi . OK , Buck . How ... How did you do that ? 20th-century Yankee ingenuity and basic electronics . You should have paid your light bill . You turkey ! Bidibidi ! Bidi ! Aargh ! Uh-oh ... Bidibidi . Oh , you are clever , Roshon , but you 're stupid to have stayed . Why did you do that ? Was it duty ? Honour ? Ah , perhaps love ? Knowing you Terrans , it was probably love . Bidibidibidi . He 's down for the ten-count ! Get these stunned men to the med techs . - Buck , are you all right ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . He 's all yours . It 's going to be a pleasure to deal with the Trebor . Thank you . - Like I said , I owed you one . - We are more than even . Get him out of here . - We 've taken the Trebor 's palace . - There was no resistance . For the first time in centuries , Katar is a free planet . In many ways , Buck , you have become the Roshon . - Darius , you know as well as ... - The people believe in the Roshon , in you . They 've gathered all around the planet waiting for their Roshon to address them . - Will you ? - All right . This is Buck Rogers . The Trebor has been defeated . I hope you 'll never again live in the shadow of fear and tyranny . But you , the people of Katar , are the only ones who can guarantee that , by finding the courage and the strength to be free . I am not the Roshon . You are , each and every one of you . You are what is real , the future of your planet is in your hands . Good luck . Thank you , Buck . - Twiki , are you ready to go home ? - Bidibidibidi . All packed . I 'll be right with you . - Now it 's my turn . - For what ? - To say thank you . - For what ? For this ... and all the thoughts behind it . - They 're still there . - I know . That 's what makes this very special . Thank you . Good bye . Good bye . - That 's an extraordinary story . - I only wish we could have been there . So do I. But everything worked out , so ... ( Bang ! Bang ! Bang ! ) Bidibidibidibidi . Reach for the sky ! I 've been telling Twiki about the myths I grew up with . He 's taking them seriously . Excuse me while I deal with Billy the Kid . Bidibidibidi . This galaxy ain 't big enough for the two of us . Maybe we can make a deal . You take the horses , the girl , and I 'll be gone by sundown . - Some deal . - All right , take the money and the horses . - You 're getting warmer . - You want the money , horses and the girl ? Bidibidibidi . You 've got it . No way , my friend . I 'd rather die with my boots on . Bidibidibidi . Well , OK . You keep the horses .

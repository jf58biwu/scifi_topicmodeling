 Film Unit PERSPEKTYWA presents Featuring Starring Still nothing . No place to move this shit . How about a smack on the bottom ? - You 're in the way . - Wait a moment longer . He 's moving . Screenplay Inspired by a legend and themes from DER GOLEM by Gustav Meyrink Reflexes ... Unconditioned - normal ... He 's coming round . Plug his mouth . What with ? Anything . That newspaper will do . Music The muck 's come out postmature . IQ I 'd say ... below sixty . - What about the matrix ? - Alive ? Yes . He looks quite nice . Photography Take the paper out or he 'll choke . Damn . It was my paper . Still unread . I 'll examine them both tomorrow . Directed by THE GOLEM 41 years after an atomic disaster the society , which was in danger of extinction ... bred rumours that artificial men were being created . One of the sources was the ancient legend of a dummy brought to life when a magic formula was put in his mouth . That such experiments might be part of the program for reconstruction of mankind is an obvious superstition . When did you last have your eyes treated ? You are on Dr Wassory 's list of patients . Not possible , I don 't know any Dr Wassory . Nonsense ! You know he 's dead . Sign this statement . - I 've never seen Dr Wassory . - Don 't you realize where you are now ? Very well ... So your name is Pernat ? I want to help the enquiry , but how ? There is one way of doing that . What can I testify ? You know more about me than I do . I don 't know my neighbours . You know that too . You asked me what my father 's name was . I just don 't know . You 've lived in that building for 30 years . You speak fluently , you are a normal , regular citizen . And now you are sitting here and ... Well , are you or aren 't you ? I work ... A man died next door to you . He was a doctor , a man needed by other people . Do you get it ? That makes all your pleas of ignorance assume an utterly different significance . Need this ? - No . - How are you doing ? Moron . I want to help the enquiry ! But I don 't know what to say as I know less than you ! We 'll begin at the beginning . Your name ? This was embedded in Dr Wassory 's gullet . An awkward instrument , but nevertheless used to murder him . What 's your view as a neighbour ? My technique is etching with acid , or engraving . Like hell it is ! A floor below you there dies our best cataract specialist . In these circumstances your " I don 't know " ... But it 's the honest truth . You 're slow on the uptake . You 'll leave here , go on functioning , but you refuse to help us ! And that is sad . What are you working on now ? I have a commission for a copper engraving . I copy the sketch on the plate and enlarge it . What do you use to do that ? A burin . Have you ever cut yourself in the process ? The burin sometimes slips . But the cut 's merely a scratch . Have you ever cut yourself in the neck ? No . I 've never done anybody any injury . What does this engraving depict ? - A man dangling in the air . - Hung ? No . As if they 'd meant to crucify him , but managed to catch hold of only one leg and left him hanging there suspended by it . - What sort of poppycock is this ? - You asked me . Are your things in the repository ? Take this and claim them . You 're free to leave . Just like that ? What is it ? - Are you collecting or depositing ? - I 'm leaving . - Read out the number and the symbol . - GZ-565 . Wait there ! You 're not allowed inside . Give me the tag . Mine were different . The number and the symbol tally . But it 's not mine . You 'd best try it on . Complaints tend to take time . What am I to do ? Leave in this ? If you want to leave at all , just get going . Gentlemen , wait ! You 've lost your glasses . Am I right ? I did as I should , didn 't I ? Wait a minute ! I had cigarettes and matches . The coat 's not mine , though I had one like it stolen . The cigarettes are the same . Where are the matches ? Why did you take them from me ? Did you have to steal them ! I can give you another box ... Is this your coat ? I don 't know . I never liked coats . Need fire ? No thanks . I don 't smoke . I only carry a pack with me . At night people sometimes need a cigarette . Some drunk , say , or loony . I can 't smoke because it 's bad for me . Will you return me my matches ? I 'm neither a drunk nor a loony . But I know you and I know that coat . I was told that you were dead , that you were blind . Do you know what cataract is ? Doctors kill people , so death to all doctors ! People drift about helplessly like these newspapers tossing in the wind . All we do is alternate between folly and wisdom , toothless and spineless ! Everything keeps terrifying us ! You 're no saint either , but the same as the rest . I 'm going in that direction . How about you ? Going home . I know where . You 're going to him . You have to , one day . But remember : He 's a criminal ! Who do you mean ? What has he done ? Begotten offspring ! A brood of them ! Not me , honestly , just my brother . He 's blind ... Such a dreadful affliction ! It 's not the two of us together . Honestly . Just him . He 's blind . How do you know he 'll fancy me ? - Everything will be fine . - Believe me ! He 'd fancy you . I 'll describe your looks afterwards . I 'll describe them in detail . Very well , but it will cost more . Why ? - Scent 's expensive . - Why scent ? If he can 't see , let him at least smell . - A lot more ? - Some 50 florins . If you don 't want it that way , you 're free to go . No , no ! My brother agrees . I mean we agree . It 's a deal . Can I come in too ? I mean , sit in ? - It turns you on ? - No , it 's not that . It 's only that afterwards ... It 's a lot of money for us . He likes me to tell him about it afterwards . - Over and over . - Very well . Come along . I 've been waiting for you . Why ? Don 't be alarmed . I 've brought you something . I don 't need anything . Do you really believe what you say ? This is for you . It 's the reason I 'm here . - What is it ? - People . Billions of people . I shouldn 't accept this . You already have it . I mean , you are alive . You just let him go ! ? It was an accident , a mistake . The staff is overworked . It won 't occur again . We 'll replace the labels with tattoos . So this Pernat is wandering about at large ? I 'd put it like this : Neo-Pernat has succeeded Proto-Pernat . Is he at least alike ? Except for a lowered consciousness . We tested that . What about the prototype ? We usually liquidate . I supervised the operation myself . And who was the original Pernat ? Does it matter ? A jailbird , I believe . Or perhaps a holy man . Excuse me . Excuse me ? Have you lost your mind ? Don 't you recognize me ? No ... I mean , yes . They let you go ... What 's the matter ? You seem to have sort of changed . Something 's odd ... They questioned me , but I didn 't know what to answer . You knew him better . Knew who ? What are you talking about ? Dr Wassory , the oculist . They kept asking about him . - What 's it to do with me ? - The murdered man . You really have changed . There 's something odd about you . You 're sort of different . Why should I know that doctor ? You lived next door . Did you ? Why are you lying ? Because of that room ? I 'm entitled to a larger apartment ! It was here . This is recent ! Piss off ! Why the fuss ? It 's all done officially . I 'm entitled to it ! It was cleared out . Why leave it ? Run along , inform on me ! You 've got me wrong . I didn 't know that doctor . I didn 't recall him and I wanted you to ... - You 've changed . - I ran into your brother . He said ... Lay off him ! You know he 's sick and suffering . He didn 't kill him . He couldn 't kill anybody ! I know what 's changed . You 're not wearing glasses . Excuse me . A kilo of potatoes , please . A kilo of potatoes , please . Is something wrong ? No , only you remind me of someone ... Oh yes , potatoes ... You 've got to give it to me , love . I must have that money . I want to get my book back from the pawnshop . Whatever you have . I don 't have any . You know that 's nothing . Be reasonable . It 's my book ! A part at least . I beg you as a father . I 've got to get my book back . So you 're cheating me . Hiding money from me in these dead bodies ? What of my book ? Where else have you hidden it ? Father , stop it ! I must have that money . My book ... Try to calm down . Come along . You 're unfair to your daughter . One , two , one , two ! Tell me , who exactly are you ? - You 're in the wrong . She , your daughter ... - Who are you ? There 's no you ! I know you , hollow clay shells . There 's no you ! What do you want ? Why this whole deception ? I bet you 're straw inside . - You 're an empty shell , admit it ! - Please try to calm down . If you are here come along to church and prove it . I 'm in funds . I can pay . What church ? This is a cinema ! No , this is the Church of the Transfiguration ! You clay abortion , this is the only place where you can confess your dreams ! Happy Dorm , Happy Dorm ! It 's the very thing ! Sleep from night to morn Is what Happy Dorm will bring ! Remember ! Happiness is your obligation . If your features trouble you modern surgery will help you solve your problems . Come and see us ! Remember ! Happiness is your obligation . Come and see us . Filthy drunks ! Trying to fool me ? I can see your leg ! You 'll pay for everything . The whole mess ! Come on out ! Please ! I 'll be right out . I 'll pay for everything . Give me a hand , Mr. Pernat . - Here ? - Anywhere you like . I 'll take this corner . You 're with him , Pernat ? You went to him and surrendered ! He 's a criminal ! - Any good with watches ? - I can 't look him in the eyes ! - My own father ! - He 's your son ! ? - Out of disgust ! - I want you to mend my watch . Let me introduce you : Mr. Pernat ... My Daddy . Bountiful father ! Thanks to you I have this splendid coat . - I , a Prodigal Son . - Don 't let go of the stove ! This coat is almost like yours . A father 's gift ! Rozyna , do something with him ! Are you angry that I refuse your money ? Do you hear me , mind witless inseminator ? It is I , prodigious procreator , sire of insensate manikins , I , one of your bungled creatures ! Do you hear me , progenitor ? It is I , your son ! Just a few steps more . Here we are . What else do you want ? You mentioned a watch . You 're going to repair it . You have very deft fingers . But it 's working . Yes , but backwards . These hands , which are moving rapidly , are all right . But this little one , which is very slow , is going backwards . You 've given up wearing glasses and you can 't see . You 'll repair it . If I can ... You 'll learn . I understand you 're gifted . Your shoulder measurements ? Measurements ? What do you mean ? The width of your shoulders in centimetres . Why do you want to know ? I 'm just asking . We were to create a new human species , better and tougher . Pernat comes close to the ideal . Let him live normally . Let 's not treat him as an experimental rat . Why the slogans ? Pernat is a trial run , a pilot model . - We can regard him as a test sample . - Tests , as with rats ? Mazes , sweets ... He 's a human being . What makes you so sure ? Don 't be alarmed . I 'm from the corporation . I 've come to test the flues . Is that stove here ? What stove ? This one ? Skip the jokes . I mean a big stove . This is my only room . I don 't have any other stove . Well then where 's the smoke coming from ? You 're the only occupant of the attic ! There wouldn 't be space for a second room . Up here there 's got to be a big stove , like a baking oven . There isn 't one . You can see for yourself . Maybe I can and then again , maybe I can 't . And what are you supposed to be ? An artist ? I just work ... And on the side you make artistic knick-knacks out of clay ? I told you I 've nothing like that . Holtrum may have . He bought a large stove recently . He 's the superintendent . Ground floor . I told you clearly enough . It 's coming from this level . It 's not my business , but you 'll burn the place down . Mr Pernat , you 've registered your brother . Why weren 't you good enough to inform me ? You must be joking . What brother ? I 've received a new register . There are two Pernats there in black and white . It must be some mistake . Sign this summon for a dental check-up . There 's nothing wrong with my teeth . Maybe , but according to the records you have a denture . Sign . Here too . What do you mean ? You don 't expect me to go chasing the other Pernat ? And whether I have a stove or not is none of your bloody business ! Come on , Rozyna . She simply lends a hand . I 've come here , to you ... To get a doll repaired ? No . I want to take you away from here for a while . - I can 't right now . I have to ... - Just for a moment ! You write the owners ' names here ? No one looks under the wigs . Come on . I can 't right now . You see , I have to ... You have to what ? Father wants to get a book back . I must raise the cash . That book is all that keeps him alive . I 'll lend it to you . It was you who put the money in the other day ? No , it must have been sewn up inside . - You 're lying . - No . I can land it to you , honestly . I can 't accept money from you . I 'll lend it to you , but I have to go home for it . How much do you need ? Two hundred florins . I 'll fetch it . Here you are . - Come on in . - Here is the money . Don 't tell my father I borrowed it from you . - Who 's that ? - I don 't even know your name . Pernat . Where did you get all that money ? Mr Pernat lent it to us . You can buy your book back now . Come here a moment . You 're selling yourself for me , for your father ? No . Nothing like that . Mr Pernat offered the money himself . She 's selling herself ? You 've got it all wrong . - I 'm lending the money . - Who lends money nowadays ? Your daughter said it meant a lot to you . So you are so kind at heart ? I thought you didn 't exist , that you 're a dummy . - So you 're different , kind-hearted ! - Stop it ! I 'll bring you my book . It will help you . I know that you need it . We must get it back . It is my view that observation is not enough . Full stop . Especially as one of the Pernat surveillance team suffered an accident in mysterious circumstances . Not too fast ? To hasten the project 's progress we should widen the program of physiological-medical and psychological-social tests . Please underline the next sentence . The first step should consist of an interim examination in laboratory conditions . Who 's here for the check-up ? - Name ? - Pernat . I was summoned to report for a dental check-up . Show me your teeth . - Suffering from toothaches ? - No , they seem all right . I 'm inclined to agree . Please open your left eye . But I 'm here for a dental check-up . You opened your right eye . Now open the left . Wider . This was to be a dental check-up ? Your teeth are okay , so why complain ? That 's better . Do you have a sense of light ? I came for a dental check-up ! You were right to . One must keep a check on one 's health . I see the beginnings of a cataract . It 's lucky you came to see me . Early diagnosis , easier treatment . Now the right eye . There 's a cataract for you ! Like a scale . By rights you should be blind ! Sister , hold his head . Just a minor operation to make sure . It will hurt a bit , but I 'll give you a sick leave . You may have some trouble seeing afterwards . Oh , you gargoyle you ! Stay seated , son , you must eat a lot ... Why won 't you let me out of here ? You can 't see yourself , so you don 't know who you are . You need to eat a lot . Why won 't you escort me home ? You can 't see , so you don 't know where you live . Eat . - Please let me out . - Go on , eat . What 's this ? - I know ... - So what ? You were to spread pigeon poison on the roof . - They shit on my backyard . - Mr Holtrum ... I gave you that poison to use . You live in the attic , I have to climb all these stairs . I 'll do it . But be careful . Wear gloves . In case you get poisoned yourself . Excuse me . Mended my watch ? I can see you haven 't even opened it ... - What are you doing ? - Can 't you see ? Measuring . Why ? A questionnaire . Typical measurements . Raise your arms . Show me your identity card . - Why ? - I need the number . You can copy it out of the register . So you don 't have one ? I 'll look for it and bring it downstairs . You have a day for the search . I want it found by tomorrow . By tomorrow . Is that clear , Mr Pernat ? - I didn 't collect it . - You got a pass . I claimed only my clothes . Lost identity cards are not our department . I collected my clothes . I must have left the card behind . Your name ? - Ashamed of it ? - You know my name . You 're not feeling well . I 'm sorry . - So what is your name ? - Pernat . - Have you changed your name ? - No . When you were last here , you had a different name . You 're mistaken . And you now want a card in the name of Pernat ? Why are you asking for a card in a name that is not your own ? But you questioned me and let me go . I 'd like that identity card back . We talked for several hours , your identity being one of the subjects , but we arrived at no constructive conclusions . I 'm afraid your name is absent from the register of the living and the dead . Anything else ? I must have an identity card , without one I don 't exist . That 's not my business . My business is criminals . In any case , I 'm through for the day . May I leave ? As easily as you came in . You are a free man . Out you go . Three , four ! Three , four ! There you are . I was looking for you ! I told you that doctors were murderers . You didn 't believe me and you still don 't ! It 's my regular prayer : Doctors kill people . Some dummy or other ... has only to bemoan his fate on the stage and everyone starts weeping . Because sob stuff plays on the riff-raff 's feelings . You see that guy ? Guess what he 'd like to do most ? Shove a stick up my ass like a puppet and shake me from side to side , left , right ! Why do people flock to the theatre so eagerly ? For the hearts and flowers , for proof that they are more sincere and human than the characters on stage ! Give this to my father . - What is it ? - Our blood . - That should do the trick . - " Our " ? His blood , but flowing in my veins . I don 't want it and I 'm giving it back to him . You need a bandage on that . I 've worked it out , to the tiniest inflection . He must take all this blood and be buried with it . That should get to him ! Only schmaltz can still get through to stiffs like him ! See he gets this , I beg you ! - Very well . - Thank you . - You promise ? - Yes . Thank you . Stiffs ... Never leave the key in the lock or they may trap you , my son . I 've come as I promised . Is it this book ? You read it thousand times . You should know . - I should ? - Yes . It contains everything . Every moment , every occurrence . It 's nice of you . Very nice of you to be making the cover for my book . But it 's a book you need more than I do . It contains answers which you alone need . What does this book reveal ? - The purpose . - I don 't understand . Many books have described how man was created but there are none which have said why , for what purpose . - And the answer 's here ? - Yes , but only for you . Can there be a book which has answers only for me ? They 're here to be found by anyone using the right vowels . If one can 't understand that , one is a fool . Right ? Look ! I kneel before you . So in the end you 're the angel and I 'm the devil . Why pick on him ? - Because he has a self of his own ? - A society of individualists like him is doomed ! It can only disintegrate ! - Individuality threatens society ? - What are we talking about ? - About us ! - Don 't exaggerate . Pernat has hardly suffered . His activeness is rising . Any further increase in awareness will make him rebel . Rebel . Is there anything you need ? Leave me alone . It 's you ? - Help me . - How ? What can I do for you ? Take me . Let 's go to the movies . Where 's the nearest cinema ? - Cinema ? - Do you feel like going ? Okay . I 'll show you the way . - I 'm sorry you found me crying . - It 's so human . Well now , shall we go to the movies ? Yes , that will be best . Your father hates you and your brother . Why ? - Simply because we 're both humans . - But his children . I 'm defective . Or do you find me attractive ? He requires perfection . He thinks we 're too unlike him . Can anyone set himself up as a model ? I know that he would like to look like you . I 'm his ideal type ? No , he despises you for your goodness . It 's only your body he envies . He says you have the look of a cultured man . He 's like to create an improved version of himself . But he spawns the likes of me , instead of , the masterpieces he craves . Do you fancy me ? Yes . He 's mad . He wants to create life . That oven is everything to him , can 't you see ? What are you trying to say ? Never mind . Do you find me attractive ? Yes indeed ! - No one 's ever stood me a movie ! - We don 't have to go back . - Stay in a cinema forever ? - This is no cinema . It is ! It 's a movie ! Look around you ! People ! - People ! - You believe they really exist ? Can 't you see ? Can 't you hear ? Let 's go over there and join them . Cut ! It 's all make - believe ! Rozyna ! Where are you ? - Quiet ! - Quiet ! - This is the wrong crowd . - The other one got lost . What do you mean , " the other crowd got lost " ? Find it . This one really is all wrong . I can try . - I 'm looking for a girl , red-haired . - We haven 't any . We were here , the crowd was cheering . You mean , you come with that crowd on the screen ? It 's only a film clip ! - So it is a movie ? - Hell no ! This is television . This girl had red hair ... Movies , girls ... Trying to convert me ? No . I 'm looking for a girl . Rozyna ... - Just a second ! - That second clip 's vanished . You haven 't seen her ? Look , I 've lost a crowd , got it ? Which bit of footage did you escape from ? Get out of here . I 'm working . So , what do we do ? Has a girl with red hair passed this way ? Is something the matter with you ? You want to help me ? I could fetch a doctor . That 's not what I mean . If you want to help me , hand me my hat . It 's too far away for me to reach . That 's the only thing I can do for you ? The only thing ? It 's what I need most . This hat ? Where would I would be without it ? Do I get it back ? You see . I feel better already . You don 't wear a hat . That frontal sinuses , baldness ... Who are you ? Background 's important , but must we always go back to square one ? I 'm the foreman . A foreman of slumber land . This girl had red hair . Have you seen her ? You 're delirious . Red hair indeed ! When you 're bald ! Look after your head . My father might need me . Right now he 's finishing his book . So he says . That book 's empty , Miriam . You know it 's a pipe-dream . You fret over me so ... What did your father do when he was younger ? Before my mother died ? He was a clerk in a record office . He recorded deaths and births . - You can 't live only for your father . - He 's unimportant . What matters to me are unexpected gifts . - I take after my mother . - When did she die ? Long ago . She was engaged to Holtrum . Your Mother ? ! Nothing came of it , luckily . He 's a sad case . He wasn 't always . I used to go and play with him when I was little . He gave me a ring . Don 't worry about me . I 'm happy here . I want to leave this place . With you . Later my mother came to hate him . He despised her for falling in love with him . But now , when his son has lost his wits ... Let 's leave . Let 's get away as far as we can ! Do you believe that one 's destiny can be changed ? But you believe in pipe-dreams ! That book , those gifts - that 's all they are ! - Give me your hand . - Why ? I want to see your lifeline , your future . I can read palms . That 's another of your illusions . - You 're afraid ? - Nonsense ! In that case give me your hand ! Let 's go . Why ? I really am very happy here . This is for me ? Specially for me ? It was yours and it still is yours . You can take it . - You mean it ? - It 's your turn today . You 're not alone . You can choose . So I have freedom of choice ? You can think you have . Like a rat in a maze . Like an ant that belongs to the ant-hill . Your results have been a let-down . This Pernat has proved a mistake , your mistake . - How can you tell ? - The progress reports . - They were my reports . I daresay . - Your materials are to be turned in to these gentlemen . The consequences of discontinuing this program ... Allow me to judge the consequences of my decisions . Do you think you 're the only team working on this program ? - Why can 't I work with them then ? A human being can still be made of Pernat . We have a new project for you : Breeding carps . What will become of Pernat ? Who is Pernat ? Don 't you worry about that . The authorized persons will find the right solution . Mr Pernat ! Come downstairs quickly ! I had a message for you , but I 've clean forgotten it . Mr Holtrum will be angry . Did you mend the watch properly ? He 'll be angry with me . Mr Holtrum ! I 've brought ... Where are you ? Mr Holtrum , your son asked me ... " ... he was sitting on the floor , holding a bottle with a dark liquid . Next to him laid the deceased " . Does that tally with the statement ? Yes . " It has been established that the liquid is blood of the same group as the blood of the deceased " . - It was not his blood . - Look , I have the lab report here . You murdered a man for a mere drop of blood ? I 've seen some perverts in my time ... Or are you perhaps a blood donor ? It was his son 's blood . Don 't act the religious maniac . Save it for the trial . I 'm sure that you are probably insane . Holtrum had no son . Do you refuse to testify ? Here 's how it was . You went in armed with your chisel and stuck it in his throat . A big man like him must have been a long time dying . You then filled the bottle and stole his watch . Why the hell did you stole the watch ? That will I never understand . - I did none of that . - Ok , so this is your story : You went in with his watch and blood in the bottle and found him dead ? - Yes . - And sat down beside him ? - First I closed his eyes . - Literally ? - Yes . - Why ? - It 's what you do to the dead . So when you see a murdered man you first move is to close his eyes ? He seemed to be staring at me . I couldn 't bear it . But you could bear to murder him and watch his blood flowing into your bottle ? Don 't worry . I shan 't be in the way . I 'm leaving soon . - Did they torture you ? - No . I confessed and signed a statement . - You confessed ? - Why be awkward ? You 'll probably be released after 48 hours . That depends . What are you supposed to have done ? A sex killing . You 're kidding . You 'll be released tomorrow for sure . I haven 't told you the whole truth . You 're the last person I 'll ever talk to . Tomorrow I 'm going for the chop . - Want some ? - Thanks , but I 'm dieting . In any case I have to be on an empty stomach . There 's no justice . You 've been victimized . It 's a disease , you mean ? I know . You 're lying to me . Nevertheless it 's true . My only next stop is the grave . So this is a death row ? Don 't let it worry you . The danger lies elsewhere . But this is a hospital . You still have a lot to look forward to . - Who are you ? - Does it matter ? A saint perhaps , a criminal ... Tomorrow I 'll be a new and better man . Right now I 'm a prisoner . Can 't you be clearer than that ? You interest me . At present they 're better at it , more precise ... I knew at once that of the two of us I 'm a goner . Been inside long ? Several years . Do you want to know how it was ? - How what was ? - With that girl . She had a lot of dolls and very fair hair . And a doll is what she served me as . I did exactly what children do with dolls . Such children may be suspected of having vicious instincts , but show me the child who never ripped a doll open . - What was her name ? - Miriam ... Yes , I think it was Miriam . I realize how awful it must be to sleep with a man like me . REPOSITORY - Depositing or claiming ? - I 'm leaving . Let 's have the tag . Wait there . Without tags there would be chaos and we can 't have that . Without tags anyone could come here and help himself . Here you are . You were right . They were not your things . Someone goofed . You still remember that ? It was so long ago . Different numbers , but the same names . That 's very rare . So now I check only the numbers . It was you who issued my things ? Did the switch make all that difference ? Close the door . Do you still have my old things ? What things ? You deposited this coat and it 's the one I 'm returning ! The number tallies and the name tallies . If you don 't like it , take it off , go back , where you came from and lodge your complaint there . I 'm sorry . They 're the right things after all . I 'll braid your hair with a rosy-red ribbon . Won 't that be nice ? You 'll have ribbons , you 'll be fed ... You 're a good man . You won 't hurt my children ? You 're leaving , aren 't you ? No ! They 're my children ! Be assured ! Don 't be fooled by slanderous whispers , by lies and old wives ' tales ! Be assured ! Don 't believe any of these fraudulent stories ! Any hocus-pocus information ! The idea that biological experiments on people have been used in a post-nuclear humanity reconstruction program is absolute rubbish , a lie , ... a mumbo-jumbo , affront to common sense . Take my word for it . Subtitles : Edward Rothert

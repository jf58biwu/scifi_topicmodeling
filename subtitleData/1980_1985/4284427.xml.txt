 We 're transporting the most important prisoner in history . JEFFREY : That was Abraham Lincoln . I heard the Rebs had kidnapped him . No wonder the South is winning . We 're going to shoot this scum right here and now ! Put him up against that wall . London , 1832 . Get to it , Fagin . Move . Oh , sorry , governor . Can 't see a thing in this bleeding fog . And pickpockets ! Bogg , the Omni ! This could be worth a lot . Considering a man 's going to die for it . BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . Green light , kid ! We did it ! ( MEN WHOOPING ) In the name of the Confederate States of America , I order you to stop this wagon ! Never ! Jump , honey ! ( WIND WHISTLING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( MEN WHOOPING ) ( CHUCKLING ) Sorry about the horse there . I ... You dirty blue belly ! Hey , now hold on . I didn 't wanna land on you any more than you wanted to land on me . Okay . Bogg , look out ! No ! Leave him alone . Hey ! Hey ! Put me down ! Don 't hurt him ! He 's just a kid ! Put me down ! Put me down ! We 've been tracking them folks all day . We finally get them out in the open so I could have a little fun with them , and what happens ? Thanks to you two , they get away ! I guess I 'm just gonna have to have my fun with you . BOGG : I don 't understand it . We helped the couple get away . It ought to be green . ( OMNI BEEPING ) Something else must be wrong . Where are we ? Pennsylvania . 1863 . Pennsylvania ? With all these Confederate soldiers ? Let me see . Oh , no . What 's wrong ? This is Gettysburg , Pennsylvania . November 19th , 1863 . So ? So I 'm not sure , Bogg . But I think today is the day Abraham Lincoln 's supposed to be here , making the Gettysburg Address . ( MAN EXCLAIMS ) Looks like you boys are gonna be having yourself a little company . This is crazy . The North won the Civil War . BOGG : Not from the look of these guys , they didn 't . Where 's your uniforms ? We ... We thought we might be safer without them . I know some others tried that . Didn 't work for them , either . The Rebs figure any man who ain 't in gray has gotta be on the run . It 's the same thing clear to Canada . Clear to Canada ? Didn 't you hear about Stonewall Jackson 's march through Ohio ? Nothing but scorched earth behind him . He cut the Union right in half . I heard the Rebs have even got gunboats on the Great Lakes now . What about the Battle of Gettysburg ? I thought that stopped them cold . Battle of Gettysburg ? There wasn 't any battle at Gettysburg . That bad ? That 's bad . Come on , get a move on . Get some food on the table . Where 'd you find these two ? In a tree . They jumped us . What were you doing up a tree ? Somebody chase you ? ( GUFFAWING ) What do you think you 're doing ? Chasing some Yankees . Having a little fun . No harm in that , is there ? We 're in charge of transporting the most important prisoner in history , and you 're out having fun ? Now , what if something had happened ? Nothing 's gonna happen . The war is all but over , anyway . Then you just give a gun to one of those Yankees . Let 's see if they think it 's over . You fool ! You know who she is ? No . What are you looking at ? Go on , get in there . Go on . What happens if the South does win the Civil War ? Are you kidding me ? You 're the history book in pants . What would happen ? Well , there wouldn 't be a United States anymore . And 100 years of history would be totally different . I guess we better find out what went wrong , huh ? Yeah . But how ? We 'll ask somebody . Come on . Come on , you guys . Move through that line . Come on , come on , keep on moving . I sure hope there 's something left for us . Sure am hungry . Better get used to it . I hear they 're taking us to Andersonville . I still can 't believe we 're losing . Losing ? It 's as good as over . I heard they 're even evacuating New York City . New York ! Get ... Wait your turn like everybody else ! Boy , you better back off while you still can . Bogg , forget it . The stuff I used to feed my dog smells better than this . Bogg , look . JEFFREY : That 's Abraham Lincoln ! BOGG : Are you sure ? JEFFREY : Sure , I 'm sure ! Everybody knows Abe Lincoln . No wonder the South is winning . And no wonder the Omni is red . BOGG : Was that really President Lincoln ? I heard the Rebs had kidnapped him , but I didn 't want to believe it . How 'd it happen ? We heard they stopped his carriage on the way home from some party . STEVE : Right in broad daylight , too . Do you know when it happened ? Sometime back in the spring of ' 62 . Look , I don 't feel much like talking anymore . Oh , sure . Yeah , I understand . Want this ? I 'm not very hungry . Thanks . What would Lincoln be doing here ? They wouldn 't keep him in a place like this . When we came in the gate , that woman was saying something about being in charge of the most important prisoner in history . They must be moving him from one prison to another . How are we gonna find out what happened ? There 's someone we could ask . Lincoln ? Look at all the guards around his tent . We 'll never get close enough . Not dressed like this , we won 't . On the other hand ... All right ! Where do you think you 're going , boy ? I 'm going to pick up his dishes . Sentry ! Wait . Sentry ? You go ahead , but you be quick about it . Yes , sir ! ( CHUCKLING ) At ease , just wanted a light from your fire . Yes , sir . I 'm sorry , sir , I was ... Orders are orders . Yes , sir . Mr. President ? My dishes are on the table . Mr. President , please don 't give up . We 're gonna get you out of this mess . No , no , no , no , please . I admire your courage , son , but no . I don 't want anyone else to die . How did it happen ? How did they kidnap you ? Well , what does it matter now ? Well , it matters to me , sir . Please , sir , I know I 'm just a kid , but I 'd really like to know . Well , I was betrayed by one of my closest aides , a Lieutenant Bates . Turned out to be a Confederate sympathizer . He gave a rebel spy the route my carriage was taking back to the White House from this party Mrs. Lincoln and I were attending . The lady had a squad of disguised rebel soldiers waiting for us . The spy was a lady ? Jane Phillips . She and one of her men are out there now . So that 's who that woman was . One more thing , sir . When did it happen ? I need to know the exact date . You 're from Atlanta ? Yes , sir . Well , there 's a whole branch of the Bogg family in Georgia . Bogg ? Yes , sir , I have heard the name . You probably know some of my cousins . Beauregard Bogg ? No ? How about old Jefferson T. Bogg ? No , sir . I don 't reckon as I 've met up with any Boggs lately . Oh , it 's a shame . Sure you have , sentry . You 've met up with Yankee Bogg . In fact , you 're talking to the dirty , uniform-stealing blue belly right now ! You still think the war 's as good as over ? Take that jacket off of him . I don 't want your Yankee sweat to ruin a fine uniform . We 're going to shoot this scum right here and now ! Put him up against that wall . REB OFFICER : Sentries ! I need a firing squad over here ! Get over here . Don 't worry , Mr. Lincoln . Bogg , get the Omni . April 18th , 1862 ! Hit it ! ( BELLS TOLLING ) ( LAUGHING ) What are we waiting for , Fagin ? Patience , my little Dodger . Our pigeon will be landing soon enough . He 'd better be . Don 't worry , Sikes . You 'll be having something to make your purse jingle before too long . Come on , you two . ( WIND WHISTLING ) Are you all right ? Yeah . I 'm just catching my breath . That was a close one . Where are we ? This isn 't Washington , D.C. Yeah , I know . I only got as far as the April 18th part . Oh . Like I said , Sikes , a gift from God 's own hand . ( DINGS ) London , 1832 . And it 's green . Sure nice to be somewhere where there 's nothing wrong . Except the weather . Come on , let 's get warmed up and get back to Lincoln . Well , move . Did Lincoln tell you what happened ? It was a woman . Isn 't that always the way ? Oh , sorry , governor . Can 't see a thing in this bleeding fog . Come on , you two ! Or I 'll take my hand to the both of you . They sure were a ragged bunch . Yeah . Sure was a bad time to be poor . The streets were filled with beggars and thieves . And pickpockets ! Bogg , the Omni ! JEFFREY : This is so awesome ! It 's like a swap meet back home . We 've been walking around this city all day . What are we doing here ? We 're miles from where they stole the Omni . Wouldn 't this be the perfect place to sell it ? Who is gonna buy it ? We 're the only ones who know what it 's for . I don 't know . My mom used to have a necklace with a big metal thing on it . Maybe some lady could wear it as jewelry . I see what you mean . I think I 'll take that . The Omni would look kind of nice on her . Not now , Bogg . Oh , it 's so beautiful . Bogg , the pickpockets from last night . That 's one of them ! Look ! Are you sure ? Sure , I 'm sure . And look . They must be the other two . The keys are in her purse , all right . That 's a good Dodger . Now , move ! ( GIGGLING ) I 'll get you ! BOY : Oh , no , you won 't ! DODGER : Oh , yes , I will ! Come on , yeah . ( GIGGLING ) Fagin , catch ! I got it , Bogg . Fagin , you rat ! Get back here and help us . Let go ! You wouldn 't hit a couple of kids , would you ? BOGG : Oh yes , I would ! Are you okay , ma 'am ? Thanks to you . Here 's your purse . Oh , thank you . Thank you . Is there anything I can do to repay you ? Just knowing that they didn 't hurt you is reward enough for us . Right , Father ? ( SIGHS ) Right , son . Well , I hope to see you and your son again sometime . Thank you . Hey , what about us ? What about you ? We 're giving you over to the police . Unless ... Unless what ? Unless you take us to Fagin . Sorry , mate , I don 't have any openings right now . I 've got all the help I need right here . Look , either you take us in , or we 're gonna turn you over to the coppers . You let your boy speak for you ? My boy is very smart . So is mine , smart and fast . Fast enough to pick the Lord Mayor 's pocket before he can finish sneezing . But not so fast he can 't be caught . True . Sadly , true . If you join us , how do you expect to share ? Equally . In the risk and in the prize . How should I trust you ? I don 't know anything about you two . You 've seen us in action . What else do you need to know ? What do you think , my babies ? Should we give them a go ? I say we put them to a test . Especially that one ! He looks too sweet to be one of us . Hey , man , you wanna step outside , I 'll show you how sweet I am . That 's fine with me , little man . Hold on , hold on . We can 't be fighting each other . He started it . And I 'm gonna end it . No , I am going to end it . We 're planning a little adventure tonight , Nancy , the Dodger and me . I tell you what . The boy can go in the Dodger 's place . If he does well , we 'll gladly take you in . He 's not taking my place ! FAGIN : He is this time ! Now , you stay there , and you be glad you got an ear for me to grab . What do you say , lads ? Are you game ? Wouldn 't be here if we weren 't . ( CHORTLING ) Come on . Get that stew going ! We 'll have a prize worth celebrating when we come back . What 's going on here ? Who was them two with Fagin ? Just a couple of blokes like us . They want to team up . Fagin 's not taking them on the job , is he ? The boy 's taking my place . Stupid ! Stupid ! Don 't you know who they are , you little scum ? They 're the two what you picked clean last night . The two that had this . What 're we gonna do , Bill ? We 're gonna wait . We 're gonna wait and see if they bring back them jewels , or the coppers . Oh , they 'll stay out of the coppers ' way , Bill . You can bet on that . Is it coppers you fear the most , boy ? No , Bill , it 's you . We 're afraid of you . ( STAMMERING ) They 'll bring back the jewels , Bill . I know they will . They better . Because if they don 't , you 're gonna be feeling the full wrath of Bill Sikes . You hear me , boy ? Bogg , we can 't really break into somebody 's house . We have to stay close to Fagin . He 's got the Omni . Maybe we can warn them somehow . Knock over a garbage can , make some kind of noise . Quiet ! Fagin 'll have your ears . Come on . Come on ! There 's a box of jewels in that bedroom that 'll put us on easy street . This is it . BOGG : We can 't fit through that . He can . Me ? Why me ? You 're taking the Dodger 's place tonight . Come on , boy , we haven 't got all night . Where does this hole go ? Into the pantry . Open the door . We 'll be waiting . ( GRUNTS ) WOMAN : Hello ? Is there someone in there ? Is there anybody in there ? Bogg ! Bogg , help me ! Help ! There 's someone in the pantry ! Run ! We can 't leave without him . If we don 't , we 'll be going to jail with him . Come on ! ( DOOR OPENS ) ( DOOR CLOSES ) Why didn 't you tell me it was Marion Brownlow 's house ? I could 've gotten invited to tea or something . She thinks I 'm a hero . Not anymore , she don 't ! We have to go back and get Jeff . As far as I 'm concerned , he can fry in his own fat . He can tell the police how to find this place . That would be a fatal mistake , for both of you . Who 's this ? This is my mate , Bill Sikes . Name means nothing to me . Oh , it will before you leave this place . If you ever leave this place . Pay attention to me , laddie , listen good to old Bill here . When old Bill has something to say , I might start to listen . I think you 'll be interested in what I have to say . Because , you see , we have a common interest in this . Uh-uh ! He 's the pigeon from last night ! Of course he is , you idiot ! That 's right . It 's mine , and I want it back . Oh , you can have it back . In exchange for what ? There 's a box of jewels in that Brownlow girl 's bedroom . Yeah , and we 'd have had them , too , if you 'd let me do me job ! I want them jewels . I don 't care how you do it . You put on some decent clothes , get back into that girl 's house and bring me them jewels . And when you do that , you can have your trinket here . And save your own skin . ( SNICKERING ) Here . I 'll take good care of this . This could be worth a lot . I hope so . Considering a man 's going to die for it . But you 're certain he didn 't hurt you ? How could he ? He was too busy hurting himself . Besides , he 's only a child . Marion , sometimes you 're a very naive young lady . I 've spent a good deal of time studying these London street urchins . They are children only in years . It 's not the fault of the children . It 's those awful men who train them how to be thieves . Oh , Charles , wait until you meet him . He 's so beautiful , and smart . Did you eat your soup ? Oh , thanks . It was great . ( CHUCKLES ) Jeffrey , I 'd like you to meet my fiancé , Mr. Dickens . Charles , this is Jeffrey Jones . How do you do ? Charles Dickens ! Do I know you , son ? No , but I know you ! I mean , I know of your work . You 're a writer , aren 't you ? You can read ? Of course . He is remarkable . Jeffrey , I 'd like you to tell Charles about that awful man who taught you how to steal . What was his name ? Bogg ? Bogg 's not the awful one . It 's Fagin . Fagin ? You mean you don 't already know about Fagin ? I 've heard of men like him . In fact , I 've even been thinking of writing about them . " Fagin . " Has a sort of evil ring to it , don 't you think ? ( CHUCKLING ) You two talk . I 'm going to see what 's happened to our tea . Now , tell me about this Fagin character . Well , these guys are bad . ( INAUDIBLE ) ( CHUCKLING ) Hi . I came to see Jeffrey . I almost didn 't recognize you . If you don 't leave right this second , I 'm calling the constable . Wait , please ! You have to believe me . Jeffrey 's ... I don 't have to believe anything of the kind ! That boy 'd be much better off if he never saw you again . Now , go away . We were off to such a good start . Don 't you remember yesterday when I saved you from the purse snatchers ? That was a trick . You just wanted to find out where I lived . No ! It was a trick , all right , but I wanted to find out where they lived . They stole something from Jeffrey and me . They already know where you live . They just wanted the keys so they wouldn 't have to break in . They 're after your jewels . And you 've come here to get my jewels for them . If I wanted to rob you , why would I be telling you all this ? To trick me again . Ask Jeffrey if I 'm telling the truth . He 's in the parlor . Jeffrey ! Bogg ! Hey , kid , easy . You okay ? Oh , sure . I just fell into some boxes . How about you ? Did you find the Omni ? We 're in big trouble . There 's another man , Bill Sikes . He makes that Fagin guy look like a saint . ( CLEARS THROAT ) This must be Bogg . Yes , sir . This is my friend , Phineas Bogg . And this is Charles Dickens . How do you do ? Hello . Bogg , this is the Charles Dickens ! Yeah , I said hello . A Christmas Carol . Bob Cratchit ? Tiny Tim ? Scrooge ? Remember ? Marion , you seem to have misjudged these two . Yes . And for once , I 'm very happy to be wrong . Scrooge ! I remember him . I think it was Christmas . Something like that . Jeffrey has been telling us about some of the fascinating characters you two have met . Oh , I can 't wait to put them on paper . I wish we had more time to talk about it , but we really have to get going . Don 't you think , Jeffrey ? Bogg , look . The window ! It was Fagin , and another man . Sikes . My Lord , they must 've followed you here . I 'll get the butler to call for a constable . No , wait . I have a better idea . What are we gonna do ? How are we gonna get past them ? By going in two directions at the same time . What ? If you can do that , sir , my hat 's off to you . You can keep your hat . Just give me some of your help . There he is ! Good day , Mr. Bogg . Come back anytime . Look out ! He 's alone . What do you think he 's up to ? Nothing we agreed to , that 's for sure . Come on . I think it 's time we took care of this one . Can I help you ? No , I thought you were someone else . I thought that might be the case . Good day . You fool , they tricked us ! Come on ! I want you to wait out here . Why ? Because I have a plan . Give me 10 seconds and start pounding on the door as hard as you can . Why ? Just do it , okay ? Where 's Fagin and Sikes ? Coppers got them . Fagin said to get the loot and get out quick . Where 's it hidden ? Come on . Hurry ! The coppers are right behind us . The coppers are right behind us . ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) See , I told you ! Where is it ? The fireplace . Over there . There 's a loose brick up in the corner . Right here . ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) Don 't just stand there ! Go out the back way . I 'll be right behind you . Go on ! Any problems ? Just a couple of small ones . Come on . Come on , Fagin , hurry ! There they are ! Now what ? Washington , D.C. , 1862 , right ? April 18th . They 've disappeared ! They can 't have done ! BOGG : Jeffrey , we said Washington and here we are . JEFFREY : Yeah , at a park . Hey , kid , I go for the soft landings every chance I get . All we have to do is replace Lincoln 's disloyal aide , this Lieutenant Bates and see that Jane Phillips doesn 't get the correct route back to the White House . Sounds good . What do you mean , it sounds good ? It is good . What 's wrong with it ? Well , Jane Phillips is no dope , right ? Right . What if she already knows what Lieutenant Bates looks like ? Presidents have more than one aide . She 'll get suspicious if he shows up with someone else . Oh , I don 't know . What if Bates ' replacement is someone who has a way with women ? A unique brand of charm , someone who is debonair , sophisticated , good-Iooking ? Okay , I 'll do it . ( LAUGHS ) ( CHAMBER MUSIC PLAYING ) ( MUSIC STOPS ) Ladies and gentlemen , the President of the United States , and Mrs. Lincoln . ( ALL APPLAUDING ) ( BAND STARTS PLAYING ) Mrs. Lincoln 's coat . Take good care of it . JEFFREY : Lieutenant Bates ? A Miss Phillips would like to see you , sir , in private . Up there . She said she 'd leave the door open for you . Thank you , boy . She is magnificent . Cool it , Casanova ! Remember , she 's a spy . ( MUSIC STOPS ) ( PEOPLE APPLAUDING ) How 'd everything go with Lieutenant Bates ? Don 't worry about him or the beautiful lady . JEFFREY : Looks like you got her attention . Are you sure she won 't recognize you from the stockade ? Relax ! All that hasn 't even happened yet . Excuse me , Mr. President , could I have a word with you ? Yes , what is it , Lieutenant ? I have some bad news about Lieutenant Bates . I 'm afraid he 's come down with something . A little food poisoning , they think . Oh , my . Well , where is he ? He 's resting . He 'll be fine in the morning . I 'm assigned to fill in for him . I don 't remember seeing you around the White House . No , sir . You wouldn 't have . I just returned from the front . Oh , yeah . What front ? The Western Front ? Ah . It 's been a hard campaign out there . I wish I could bring all of you men back for a good rest . You 're doing a fine job . Thank you , sir . If there 's anything I can do , just let me know . At the moment , my only order is that you have a good time . Yes , sir . I 'm certain I can handle the assignment . ( BAND STARTS PLAYING ) Thank you . My pleasure . If a man was ever born to wear a uniform , it 's you . There are other uniforms I prefer . A lighter color might be more complimentary to your eyes . And closer to my heart . Lieutenant Bates couldn 't make it . He sent me in his place . Well , I think he made an excellent choice . Well , thank you . Would you care to dance ? I 'd be delighted . ( MUSIC STOPS ) ( PEOPLE APPLAUDING ) ( BAND STARTS PLAYING ) You dance beautifully . I suppose you do everything this well ? Many things I do much better . And you 're sure about the route ? Absolutely . Are you sure of your men ? They 'll be in place . Make sure they know whose side I 'm on . Don 't worry . I 'd never let anything happen to you . ( CHUCKLES ) ( MUSIC STOPS ) A messenger will be waiting to take the route to my men . I 'll be right back . Well ? I gave her the route back to the White House . What ? The wrong route . ( SIGHS WITH RELIEF ) ( CHUCKLING ) Will you relax ? I 've got her wrapped around my little finger . Well , then , I guess that does it . I guess so . You know , I gotta tell you . You were really hot out there . I didn 't know you could dance like that . Are you kidding ? ( OMNI BEEPING ) Didn 't you ever hear of Nijinsky ? Come on , Bogg . You 're not gonna tell me you taught Nijinsky how to dance ? Taught him ? Wednesday matinees , I was Nijinsky . Bogg ! Look . Now what 's she up to ? Oh , Lieutenant ? Yes , sir ? I 'm ready to leave now . Would you get the carriage , please ? Yes , sir . Oh , and by the way , Lieutenant , I 've invited Miss Phillips to join Mrs. Lincoln and me at the White House for coffee . I 'll get her carriage , too , sir . That won 't be necessary . The President has graciously invited me to ride along with him in his carriage , and I would very much like it if you 'd join us . I 'd be honored . Yes . This should be the perfect end to a perfect day . We 'll meet you in the foyer . Jane , won 't you come help me find Mrs. Lincoln ? Oh , of course . Now what ? She 's in for a big surprise . By the way , how are you gonna get to the White House ? Don 't worry , I 'll hitch a ride . When the President told me that you were a hero who 'd just returned from combat , well ... I want to hear everything . Yes , Lieutenant , we 'd all be most interested to learn your impressions of the action . Well , I 'm sure it 's just like any other war . Why is it that the real heroes are always the modest ones ? What 's going on ? We 're supposed to be taking Rock Creek Road . I guess there was a change in plans . Well , there 's gonna be another change in plans . Do you know what you 're doing ? What this will mean ? It will mean that Jeff Davis will be sleeping in the White House before Christmas . Now , tell the officer to get back on the other road . Lieutenant , stop the column . Halt ! Halt ! We 'll take the country route after all . Column left , ho ! This way is much prettier , and far more isolated . Jane Phillips , a traitor . I can 't believe it . Not a traitor , Mr. Lincoln , a patriot . Two patriots , in fact . ( MEN WHOOPING ) JEFFREY : Oh , no ! All right . Take it easy and everything will be all right . All right , climb down from there . Everything all right in there ? Everything in here is just fine . Soldier , take my horse . Everybody , just sit back and relax . We 're gonna take a little ride down to Richmond . What are you doing ? Changing a patriot back into a traitor . What ? BOGG : Open the door . ( URGING HORSE ) ( EXCLAIMS ) Whoa , whoa ! Stop ! JEFFREY : Stop ! Slow down . Whoa , slow down ! JEFFREY : Slow down , whoa ! Slow down ! ( YELLING ) Stop , horse ! Whoa , boy , whoa ! Slow ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Yeah ! Okay , that 's good . Wow , kid . Where 'd you learn that trick ? Western movies . John Wayne made it look easy . Yeah . Well , there 's a big difference between you and John Wayne . Yeah . About four feet . Mr. Lincoln , Mrs. Lincoln , you all right ? Yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , we 're fine . Fine . Now , there , there . Thank you . If it hadn 't been for you two , I ... I don 't know what to say . Don 't worry about it , Mr. President . When the time comes , you 'll know what to say . Bogg , are you sure this is the right date ? ( DINGS ) November 19th , 1863 . Are you sure this is the right place ? ( PEOPLE APPLAUDING ) Come on , Bogg . Hurry . Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent , a new nation , conceived in liberty , and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal . Now we are engaged in a great civil war , testing whether that nation , or any nation so conceived and so dedicated , can long endure . We are met on a great battlefield of that war . We have come to dedicate a portion of that field , as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live . JEFFREY ...

II mean , can you cIIone a IIiving organism from the hair of a dead man ? Human hair consists of keratinised ceIIIIs .

Otherwise , wait for the Feds . Wait for the Feds . They get the 6 : 00 news , and we get the shit end of the stick . That 's the way it is . Yeah , weIIII , it doesn 't have to be that way .

No , nobody . Not even one ? Out of all the men you 've been kissed by ? Well , that 'll take some figuring . How many men you think there 've been ? I wouldn 't know . Can 't you give me an estimate ? Not without an adding machine . You have your adding machine with you ? I forgot to bring it . Then I guess you won 't find out , will you ? Hey there , buddy . Are you in there ? lit 's none of my business , but if that 's your Mustang in the parking IIot there 's two cops trying to jigger the IIock . The bastards ran one on us ! Papa CharIIie 3 .

 Previously on The O.C. Is it just me , or is Zach perfect ? He is like Newport 's Prince William . I get nervous , and I start talking , and then nothing can shut me up . Except that . I have missed you all day . Does this count as adultery ? You 're not , like , becoming friends , are you ? Would that be so terrible ? Really ? You don 't go to school ? I got kicked out . Of Corona , Mater Dei and even Newport Union . 16 years ago I made an error in judgment , one that almost ruined my marriage . You 're my father ? - Hey , man , what 's going on ? - Studying . Would you punch someone , please , for old time 's sake ? All right , fine , logarithms are the new uppercut , I got it . - Wow . Now I see it . - See what ? I been looking through old photos of my mom , looking for resemblances to Lindsay . Look at that . Are you trying to make this more awkward for me ? What ? It 's not like you dating Lindsay 's full-on incest you 're not even really related . You 're not- - you wouldn 't get arrested , you wouldn 't have chromosomally challenged children . Kirsten 's , like , my mom . Lindsay is ... clearly her sister . It is kind of weird . The fact that your mom doesn 't know that I 'm dating her sister , it 's a lot weird . I think they did a storyline like this on The Valley once . Great , could you tell me how it ends , then ? Well , you just have to ask yourself the question , Ryan : is she your girlfriend , or is she your aunt ? Ah , yes , the age-old question . That 's right . it 's a story as old as time , really . Boy meets girl , boy likes girl , boy finds out girl is surrogate mother 's illegitimate half-sister . I 'm guessing it 's too soon to joke , Seth , even for a Cohen . I just don 't know what to do , you know ? What to say . Well , have you talked to Lindsay ? Nah , wanted to give her space over winter break , let her figure everything out . That 's all you can do . And if she comes back and decides she wants to be part of this family ... Then we 're done dating , huh ? Unless you want to move to the South . Kirsten doesn 't know you 're seeing Lindsay , right ? She thinks we 're just friends . Good , ' cause I think it 's best that the Mrs. doesn 't find out . Well , that 's something that every wife wants to hear . - Doesn 't find out what ? - How much I love you ? - Sandy ? - Yes ? You don 't have to lie to me . I know that Renee 's testimony is today , and that my father is going free . - Yeah . - Sharp as a tack . Just , it 's , like , a laser beam . But that doesn 't mean I have to forgive him . Not after what he did to Lindsay , that poor girl . I 've been thinking . We should do something for her . This girl grew up not knowing who she is or where she 's from , and we 're her family . - If she wants us . - Oh , she wants us . I mean ... you guys . Well , you , too , Ryan- - you 're as much a part of this family as any of us . I mean , if she 's my sister , she 's your aunt . Well , thanks for clearing that one up , honey . Actually , she 's so young , she 's more like your sister . Oh . Hey , a sister . I always wanted one of those . Ryan , how about you ? The O.C. 207 , OC team Cookie , Synchro VO Scidou Don 't worry about it , 'cause it 's no biggie . What are you talking about ? When Seth met your dad , it almost ended the relationship . Well , DJ meeting your dad can 't be worse than when he met your mom . I suppose this time he will be wearing clothes . I don 't know , DJ without his clothes on ? Pretty undeniable . Look , it 'll be fine . Your dad 's totally chill . He won 't judge . It 's just , he 's the only sane person in my family , the only one who comes even close to getting me . And I really want him to like DJ . - Oh , hey , Seth . What 's up , man ? - Hey ! What 's going on , man ? - Did you get my Christmas card ? - I did . I appreciate the apology . So , uh , we 're friends again , then ? We 're real men , okay ? Red-blooded meat eaters . Occasionally from time to time we 're going to brawl . It 's our nature . So we can talk about stuff , confidential stuff , and it 's cool ? Yeah , listen , man , after all the trouble I caused , I 'm happy to have a chance to help , so come on . while I was in Cabo with my family , uh , I ran into an old girlfriend , and , uh , we were at Squid Row , late , and , uh , we kind of kissed . All right , well , first question , um ... this old flame , do you still have feelings for her ? Well , I really like her kids . Uh , she 's a little older than me . She was my math tutor when I was 14 . Holy ... ' 80s teen comedy plot . She 's in the middle of a divorce , she had had a lot of tequila , Chingy was playing ... Oh . Chingy and tequila . Seduction has no two finer allies . It was just a quick kiss , and then I , like , ran out of there , but ... I feel really guilty . Well , man , if it was anybody else , I would say keep it to yourself , you 'll lead a much happier life . No , I can 't do that , man . I know- - because you have a conscience , whatever , so you got to be honest with Summer , then . Tell her you feel terrible , and tell her that all it did was make you realize how much you like her . And definitely do not mention the ex having kids and multiple divorces . - You should be fine . - You think so ? - Yeah , you 'll be good . And you 're not gonna tell anyone , are you ? Zach ... even if I wanted to , the code , it dictates ... I cannot . - How was your vacation ? / - How have you been ? - I wanted to call you . - No , I 'm glad you didn 't . I-I mean , I wanted to talk to you , but ... I haven 't really been in the frame of mind to talk to anyone about anything . Not even your mom ? Uh , not until I 've completed several hundred hours of intense psychotherapy . Which was a very thoughtful gift from her , by the way . Well , if you need some more time . I mean , if you don 't want to hang out right now , uh , or ever . Uh , I-I do . We just need to find our own personal Switzerland . Someplace neutral . And we can 't hang out at my house 'cause my mom 's there , - and ... we can 't hang out at your house .. - Because your sister 's there ? She 's not my , um ... I mean , I guess technically she is , but ... Just so I can be clear on what everybody is to everybody : - you and the Cohens ? - Friends . They 're my friends . - And me and you ? - More than friends ? - More than friends . - And definitely not related . I don 't want this to be like kissing your sister . The thought never crossed my mind . I got to tell you , Sanford , you 're one hell of a lawyer . The charges have been dropped , and the secrets of our situation sealed by the courts . You did it . I 'm a free man . And a smug one , too . Excuse me for wringing a little joy out of the one bitof good news I 've had for some time . Well , never mind the fact that the news came at the expense of your family . Or did you fail to notice Kirsten 's absence at the hearing this morning ? I know I 've got some work to do on my relationship with my daughter . Now , which daughter are we talking about ? I 'm not saying it 's gonna be easy with Kirsten . Once I get back to work , I can lighten her load ... Whoa , whoa , wait , wait , wait . Back to work ? Now that the scandal 's gone , there 's no reason for me to distance myself from the Newport Group . Except for the fact that the woman running the company hates you . Which woman are we talking about ? Well , I hope he 's not expecting a party in his honor . Yeah , I 'll ... I 'll see you back at the office . Bye , Kirsten . - He 's free ? - He 's free . I might have to spike these drinks . I don 't know if they 're strong enough . He , uh ... he won 't serve any jail time . That 's it . It 's just ... Over ? What are we talking about here , Jimmy , Caleb ... or us ? Definitely not strong enough . Well , I should get back to the office , back to my life , huh ? But what if it wasn 't my life ? What if I could just walk away from it ? Well , that would depend on what you 're walking to . Maybe we just needed this time apart to appreciate each other , what we had . But what if we ... can 't ever have it again ? I 'm willing to find out if you are . Hi . I hope you don 't mind me showing up like this . I was wondering if I could give you a ride home . Oh , uh , thanks , but I have a car . A-And there 's a better than 50 / 50 chance it 'll actually start . Well , I know there 's no right way to do this , FTD doesn 't make a ... Happy Surprise Sister bouquet ? And , uh , I know you 're not on the market for any new relatives , but ... how about a friend ? We could go grab a friendly cup of coffee . Yeah , a friendly cup of coffee would be cool . You have nothing to be nervous about . It 's gonna be great . What 's he into ? Does he like sports ? Uh , he really likes ESPN Classics . Is that your mom ? Alex , it 's Seth . Come on , I came over to welcome you back . You 've really changed over break . Wow . - Who are you ? - Uh , just , um , a guy . I probably have the wrong apartment . Sorry . Seth ? What are you doing here ? I came over to say hi , see how your vacation was . Didn 't realize I needed to bring my own tourniquet . Sorry , I just ... I didn 't expect you to be here . Especially so early in the morning . It 's 3 : 30 in the afternoon . Family vacations really take it out of you , huh ? Oh , yeah . I bailed on family early . I just came back to catch up with old friends . Wait , so you 've been back for a while and you didn 't ... I don 't know , call me ? I 've been catching up with old friends . Who , the large shirtless guy that answered the door ... he asked , not remotely jealous . You know , I am ... - so hung over right now . I just think ... - Are you ? Well , have you ... have you eaten anything ? You want me to maybe put some coffee on or fix you a sandwich ? Fix me a sandwich ? Hey , Alex , we 're going to go grab some smokes and some more beers , we 'll be right back . Okay . Okay , I 'm trying to do the math here and , uh ... well , I have a few questions . I will answer all of your questions tonight at the Modest Mouse concert , okay ? It 's just , my head is killing me and ... So , it was nice to see you . Really nice of you to stop by . Really nice . Nice . She kept saying the word " nice . " You know what that means , don 't you ? - Aw , she thinks you 're nice . - Yeah , exactly- - nice . As in lacking any edge and / or danger . Well , you did offer to fix her a sandwich . Oh ... I know . It 's like the more edgy and dangerous she became , the more I became like a Jewish grandmother . Not your grandmother . Keep shucking , Seth . I want dinner ready by the time your mother gets home . Hey , maybe I don 't feel like shucking these , okay ? ! Maybe you should go and shuck ' em yourself , old man . That 's good . You had me shaking in my boots . I 'm so screwed . Bruce Banner gets mad , he turns into the Hulk . I get mad , I turn into , like , a 75-year-old yenta named Sylvia . Hey , look at all this . You guys making dinner ? - We wanted to surprise you . - I have a little surprise myself . - Look who 's joining us . - Oh ! We were having coffee and we were talking and then we did a little shopping . A lot of shopping . And next thing you know , it was dinner time . I hope you guys don 't mind me crashing . No , no , no . Not at all . I think dinner with all of us would be really nice . - Don 't you , Ryan ? - Nice , yeah . - Hey , kiddo . - Hey . Why did you and DJ cancel on me today ? I was looking forward to meeting him . It just wasn 't a good time . I had a lot of homework and he was really tired . You were busy making out with Mom . What ? - Marissa . That ... what ? - Dad , I saw you . Okay . Look ... I know how it must have looked . Yeah , it looked a lot like it used to when you would kiss Mom . But you know , that was before she was married to someone else . Look , I wanted to talk to you about it . We both wanted ... How could you get back together with her ? I mean , don 't you remember how she ruined your life and mine ? - Things are different now . - Oh , really ? So you 're not back to lying , cheating , and sneaking around again ? I thought you were past that . I thought you were going to take this new money and start over . Please , let me , let me , let me explain . What 's there to talk about ? We already know how it ends . We 've already lived through this once . You know , for once , I wish you would just grow up and be like a real dad . What are you doing ? Hey , I just , uh , I needed to borrow a wife-beater for tonight . I thought you had several , so ... Yeah , and why are you wearing it ? Well , Alex , she called me nice , Ryan . So what I 'm trying to do is cultivate more of a , more of a bad boy image . Yeah , I don 't think that 's going to get the job done . You 're right . I need to borrow your wrist cuff . Oh , hey , also , remember that choker you used to wear ? - No . Just , no . - All right . You 're extra broodish . What 's up ? Is that Lindsay thing still bothering you ? Not at all . I mean , we had a really nice family dinner . I know , I thought so . Which is part of the problem , right ? Got it . It shouldn 't be a problem . I mean , Lindsay wants to hang out with the sister she never knew she had , I can 't stand in the way . Or make it all about me , right ? No , that 's something I would do . Which is perfect because you 're becoming more like me , which paves the way for me to become the brooding bad boy . - You realize we 're both screwed ? - Dude , I 'm wearing a wife-beater . These walls are paper thin And everyone hears every little sound Everyone 's a voyeurist , they 're watching me Watch them , watch me , right now They 're shakin ' hands , they 're shakin in their shoes Oh , Lord , don 't shake me down Everyone wants two of them And half of everyone else who 's around Laugh hard , it 's a long ways to the bank I can 't be blamed for nothin ' anymore - What 's that ? - What 's what ? Oh , this ? - This is my good friend , John . - John ? - Yeah , a good friend of mine . - Who 's John ? No , I said , I said Jim . Or , no , what I meant to say was Jack . They 're all my friends . Yeah , that ought to take the edge off right there . - Yeah , you guys seem real friendly . - We 're super friendly . So if you need me , I 'm going to be drinking by the speaker 'cause I don 't care about tinnitus , okay ? Uh , I 've got terrible news , really . I 've fallen in love with my ex-wife . - You were married before Julie ? - You 're in love with Julie ? - I don 't believe that . - Oh , unfortunately , I do . Jimmy , after everything she did to you before ? I know , that 's what Marissa said . - Marissa knows ? - She caught us . And the things she said ... well , they 're all true . Look , here 's the deal . I can 't be here and be with Julie . But right now , I can 't be here and ... not be with Julie . What are you saying ? When Hailey left , I felt adrift . So I made some calls to see what was out there and I came across this company that charters yachts for sale in Maui . - You 're leaving ? - Yeah . I need to get away from here before I do any more damage to myself or to my kids ... to , to Julie . I love Newport , but it 's , it 's no good for me right now . In the last year , I 've nearly been arrested and bankrupt for stealing from my clients , I got punched out at my daughter 's cotillion , I lost my house , my family , I tried to kiss you , which I-I still feel terrible about . I spent the summer drunk on a boat with your 25-year-old sister , and now I 'm getting back together with a woman who , who started this in the first place . I can 't stay here any longer . I just can 't do it . So when would you go ? Well , they faxed over a contract a couple of weeks ago . All I have to do is sign it and it 's mine . A couple of days and I 'm ... I 'm history . Your gun went off . Well , you shot off your mouth and look where it got you My mouth runs on , too Shouts from both sides Well , we 've got the land . But they 've got the view . Well , now , here 's the clue You 're giving me the pinky ? I 'm not really into public displays of affection . All right , let 's go . Outside , we 've got to talk . So , too bad Coop couldn 't make it . Um , Zach , only I can call her Coop . It 's kind of weird when you say it . Got it . Too bad Marissa couldn 't make it . I 'd be freaking out , too if my mom and dad were getting back together , and , like , kept this huge secret from me . Yeah , so , uh , we haven 't had a chance to talk about our winter breaks yet . - I know . - Hey ! Modest Mouse ! Hey , volume , Cohen . It 's not Metallica . No , it 's not Metallica ! It 's Modest Mouse ! Ew ! You 're like so sweaty . Come here . Wait . Your breath smells like Marissa ! You are so drunk ! So , hey , you guys are hanging out . That 's cool . I guess she was cool with it , right ? Cool with what ? - Thanks , Seth . - You 're welcome . Welcome . Hey ... is the stage revolving or are we ? They 're really good . What 's the matter ? You know what ? You 're the matter . I mean , you 've been weird all night . You 've been weird pretty much since I showed up for dinner , which , by the way , was weird for me , too . Well , what happened to Switzerland ? Uh , Kirsten wanted to hang out and she 's really cool . She is . And if you want to hang out with her , you should . But if the Cohens are really my family , then you are my family . Which means kissing me is like kissing your sister or step-aunt . Ryan ! You have to take Seth home , right now . He is wasted and leaving a path of destruction in his wake . I cannot believe you . And I cannot believe that you told Cohen . See ? And he puked all over the merchandise table , which I now have to go and mop up . Ah ! I know who lives here ! This is the Cohen residence in the heezy . Okay , okay , we 've got to be really stealth here . Hey , I was all-camp , Capture The Flag , Camp Tacaho , I invented the stealth . - That 's right , you did . - I sure did ! But you 're yelling . You need to be quiet . I haven 't been this wasted since your first night in Newport , when we beat up those kids . With a little bit of that ... and a little bit of that . - You need the seat belt . - Little bit of that ... You need your seat belt . What 's going on ? You guys okay ? Seth ? Shh ... We 're being stealth . Shh . Look , everything you said yesterday , you were right . I 'm making the same mistakes all over again with your mom . - So you 're going to end it ? - Yeah . Yeah , I am . Well , that 's great , Dad . But , it 's , uh , it 's ... it 's more complicated than that . I , um , I need to get some perspective on the world , or ... or something . You 're right . I need to learn how to be a real dad . - So , I 'm , uh , leaving . - What ? Yeah , I 'm moving to Maui . That 's your idea of being a real dad ? Abandoning me and moving to Hawaii ? It 's not forever . It 's only for six months , maybe . You can come and visit anytime you want . Well , good luck with that . I mean , I hear Maui 's beautiful . Uh , you know , there 's going to be a good-bye party , tonight at the Cohens ' . - Are you okay ? - Uh-huh . Totally . I mean , you were the last thing keeping me sane , so when you leave it should be interesting to see how things go . But , uh , I 'll see you tonight . Hello . I just came by to tell you I 'm dying and thank you for your friendship . Oh ... slowly , slowly . Oh , and also to apologize for whatever happened last night . You don 't have to apologize to me . - Have you talked to Zach ? - No , why ? Ah , you kind of destroyed his relationship with Summer . - Oh , I violated the code of man . - Mmm . Talked to Alex ? She won 't answer my calls . Hmm . Might have something to do with all the vomit . All the vomit ? How much vomit ? Like the little girl in Sixth Sense or the fat guy in Monty Python ? Well , you wanted to be a bad boy . You did bad . Yeah , but not in a good way . I 've got to talk to Alex . I 'm sure I can be a good bad boy , not a bad bad boy . - Mm-hmm . Good luck with that . Aspirin ? - Thank you . You have lobster rolls , right ? He loves lobster rolls . Oh , if it isn 't my son , the wine-oh You guys found out ? - You weren 't exactly stealth . - Damn . I lost a step since Tahoe . Your dad 's been waiting for you to leave the room , so he can send you back to it . That 's great . Um , I know I should probably be used to this at this point , but uh , are we having a party ? It 's Jimmy Cooper 's going away party . Oh , okay , wow . Great . Then I 'm going to run a quick errand real fast and then I 'm going to come straight home . - You 're not going anywhere . - Dad , I 'm grounded . I get it , I deserve it , okay ? Even though this headache is just far worse than any punishment that you could administer ... No . I need to go see a girl very fast , and then I will come straight home . Now , which girl is this ? The one who thinks you 're too nice ? The one you 're trying to impress by drinking a fifth of Jack ? I think his name was John , but yes , and Dad , it went horribly , okay ? So I just need to talk to her really fast and I need to , you know , sort of , you know ... Go upstairs and get dressed . You know what , maybe if I 'm grounded , I shouldn 't go to this party . I 'm going to go get dressed . Stairs . Hi . I got you something . It 's the novelization of The Valley , Season One . I have the hard cover signed by Gertie Bridges . I should go . No , that 's why I 'm here . I wanted to give you a ride . - Actually , I 'm going to go alone . - You 're going by yourself ? Han Solo . Okay ? But if I change my mind , I 'll have Cohen get drunk and let you know , okay ? - Summer , come on . - Hooking up with your tutor , Zach ? Not even that cool in the ' 80 's . I mean , she could have at least been a hooker and helped you get into Princeton . Come around in this fine town where their freedom makes the world go around Where dreams are found ... - Hey , Julie . - Hey , uh , Kirsten . Sad day , thinking about Jimmy Cooper , huh ? Why , I remember when he was a boy , taking him out in the boat , inviting him over ... for dinner . Listen , I 'll see you in a few . I 'm gonna slip out for a while . I 'm trying to fix things with Alex . - What about your parents ? - They 're scary . Which is why I need you to cover for me , okay ? Just throw up the smoke screen , give them some of that Ryan Atwood double talk . I barely talk . Good point . The less said , the better . I-I don 't think this is a good idea , man . You call yourself a bad boy . Jimbo . I 'm sorry we couldn 't get a better turnout for you . Well , considering I defrauded most of my closest friends ... it 's not bad . - I 'm going to miss you , Jimmy . - Ah , well . Thanks , Sandy . - How 'd she take the news ? - I haven 't talked to her yet . Good luck with that . Hi , Julie . Were you just going to send me a postcard ? I wouldn 't have known you were leaving if Kirsten hadn 't invited me to your going away party . Of course I was going to tell you . Can we , can we talk about this someplace a little bit more private , please ? Look who stopped by . I 'm going to go grab some champagne . You two have fun . Now we 're waving at each other . I thought you agreed Kirsten can 't find out about us , right ? Right , because then it might be weird . Ryan , have you seen ... Lindsay , hello . Excuse me , I didn 't mean to interrupt . I 'll find Julie myself . Good to see you . Bye , Dad . Yeah , this isn 't going to be weird at all . Did you really think that this was going somewhere ? I don 't know , Jimmy . I was under the impression that this meant something . Well , it did . It ... does . But did you really think it was going to last ? You really think that I would leave you again ? Well , history isn 't exactly working in your favor on that one . Plus , you deserve to be happy with Caleb . Oh , yeah , that 's a storybook romance with our illegitimate children and our tapped phone lines . At least it 's real . Jules . Jules . You 've got to go so soon ? I think it 's probably best I go before anyone knows why I 'm going . Oh , I ... I 'm s-sorry . I didn 't mean to ... It 's fine . We 're just saying our good-byes . - See you , James . - So long , Jules . Hey ! People I know . - Yeah . Where 's Zach ? - He couldn 't make it . - Where 's Cohen ? - Oh , he 's hurting from last night . Well , I 'd like to hurt him for last night . Kind of a boring party . Not for long . I 'm fine . Well , if it isn 't the wicked witch of the west coast . Are you drunk ? Let me guess : tequila ? She was like this when I picked her up . You don 't have to defend yourself to her . No , but you do , young lady . Come on , let 's go , DJ , before she tries to sleep with you next . - What did you say ? - You heard me , you whore . - Hey , guys , guys , not here . - No , let 's do it here . Okay ? You know what ? Let 's tell everyone why you 're leaving , Dad . Why don 't you tell everyone why you 're leaving . Huh ? Hello , everybody . - Let 's go , Marissa , you 're drunk . - Get off of me . Guys , hey , guys . Come on . Come on . Do you see what you 're leaving me with ? You see how screwed up she is ? Of course I 'm screwed up . I 'm the daughter of a thief and a slut . You know what , I just ... I just hate you both so much . You wanted a good old-fashioned O.C. party . I just hope she 's okay , and that she calls . As bad as I thought she 'd take it , that was worse . Well , it 's going to be hard for her . For all of us . I was hoping that while I 'm gone , you 'd go over to the house and check up on her . - My father lives in that house , Jimmy . - I know . That 's why I want you to go there . I need to know that someone is watching over her . For my oldest friend , anything . I can 't believe this . If we had gotten married , I 'd be moving to Hawaii . No , if I 'd married you , there 's no way I would have left . I just want to get the hell out of here . Where 'd they park my car , Irvine ? Excuse me , Mr. Nichol . Uh , there 's a problem with your car . - You scratched my Aston Martin ? - Your car 's been stolen . - Wow , who 's car is that ? - This ? It 's mine , Alex . - I stole it . - You stole a car ? Yep . I do that sometimes , Alex . I do it for kicks . Are you trying to impress me or something ? What ? You know , with getting drunk and stealing cars , and ... It 's just ... Seth , I 've been with a lot of bad boys and you are not one of them . Right . Well , I 'm just gonna make a Bundt cake and put on some tea . See you later . No , Seth , you 're a good guy . And that 's why I like you . Really ? Well , that 's good , because I don 't think this whole bad boy thing is really working out for me . Me neither . Is this your vehicle , sir ? What are you still doing here ? Uh , your stepmom blocked my car in . I tried to wake her up , but is she , like , alive ? Yeah , just heavily medicated . - Uh , how was the party ? - I don 't know . Maybe I should hire you a tutor and she can catch you up on everything . Look ... I 've had a lot of time to sit here , vibrating at a very high frequency and think . And I realize this is a really important moment for us . This is our first fight that wasn 't about Cohen . I mean , he helped , but this fight , it 's ours . - I guess that 's true . - I 'm really sorry . - It didn 't mean anything , believe me . - It 's not about what happened , Zach . It 's just that you didn 't tell me , you told Cohen . From now on , I 'll tell you everything . Why , planning on screwing up again ? Only one way to find out . We finally have a moment alone . Yeah , maybe a chance to talk about everything . You know what ? I don 't want to . I mean , we keep hypothesizing how kissing me might be like kissing your sister , and I think we should just find out . So you want me to kiss you as an experiment ? Yeah . And if it truly is weird , well , then that 's our answer . Okay . - No , uh , pressure . - Right . She 's everything Everything I 'm already somebody 's baby You don 't deserve to feel for me Oh , hey , guys . I was wondering if you 've seen Seth . No . We were just looking for him ourselves . Okay , thanks . That was close Yeah , maybe we should just ... keep this to ourselves for now . At least until we find out if we 're breaking any laws . Hey , Dad . How was the party ? I think somebody called the cops . - Hey . - What are you doing here ? - I called him . - Thanks , DJ . Appreciate it . You mind if I join you ? I never thought I 'd leave this place . I guess life doesn 't always turn out the way you think it will , huh ? I 'll take that as a pensive " no . " I 'm sorry , Marissa . I 'm so sorry . I 'm sorry I let you down . I 'm sorry that I ... I couldn 't ... give you the life that ... that you deserve . Although I nearly went to jail trying . You 've got to give a guy credit for that . - Sweetheart . - Don 't go . Please , don 't go . Don 't leave me . I got to go . I got to ... I got to get a life . I know , I know . It stinks . But ... But , listen , anytime you want to come live with me , you just let me know , okay ? And I will send a boat or a plane , whatever , okay ? It 's getting ... it 's getting kind of cold . I think we should head back , huh ? - Want to get out of here ? - Wait . Can we just ... Can we just sit here for a while ? Sure , kiddo . Here , put this on . You must be freezing . I 'll sit with you all night . Ice-age heat wave , can 't complain if the world 's at large , why should I remain ? Walked away to another plan Gonna find another place , maybe one I can stand I move on to another day To a whole new town ... - Are you okay ? - Yeah .

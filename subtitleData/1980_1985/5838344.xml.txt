 Servalan told us it was an old ship . It 's what she didn 't tell us that interests me . ( Croaking ) - There 's something moving down there . - Where ? By the main lock . It 's just a link . It 's going in . Move . Down ! Cover your eyes . - So much for what Servalan didn 't tell us . - It 's quite a booby trap . Half a booby trap to be exact . Come on , let 's go . Half a booby trap ? I don 't imagine she would mine the ship and leave the living quarters intact . - We 've got to warn the others . - Take it slowly , Dayna . Slowly ? It 's going to be no help to them if we walk into something hungry on the way back . I don 't intend to walk into anything . - Don 't be stupid . - Get out of my way , Avon . I 'll see you at the base . I doubt it . ( Creature screeching ) - Thanks . - Are you ready to take it slowly now ? Don 't you ever get bored with being right ? Just with the rest of you being wrong . Try and keep a sharp lookout . We can 't afford to waste any more ammunition . If you 're right about the base ... If I 'm right about the base , the charges will already have been triggered . What do you mean ? Ultrasonic fuses keyed to pick up the explosion from that ship . - That 's how I would have done it . - Well , then they 're already dead . Well , that 's what we 're going to find out . Come on , you great oaf . This is no time to take a nap . If I 've broken my back hauling a corpse about , I 'll never forgive you , Tarrant . ( Voice echoing ) Cally . Cally ! - CALLY : ( Voice echoing ) Vila . - Cally . Hang on , Cally . I 'm coming . CALLY : Blake ! - Slave . - Yes , Master ? - How long before we make planet fall ? - One hour , Master . That is Earth standard time , of course . I hope that is satisfactory . There 's still no sign of the Liberator on our screen . I fear not , Master . I 'm getting a heavy radiation shadow . Focus looks to be 001 to our present heading . Check it . At once , Master . It appears to be the residual of an explosion , Master . Analysis of the radiation pattern suggests it could have happened near the planet of our destination . And it generated a lot more power than the death of any normal ship would have done . - You are correct as always , Master . - Do you think it was the Liberator ? Thought is beyond my humble capacities , Master . True . Vila rescued me ? You were injured trying to rescue Cally . He rescued you . - Suddenly I am hip deep in heroes . - Where is Cally ? - Cally is dead . - Are you sure ? - Yes , I 'm sure . - He went back in . He wanted to be a hero , too . We needed Orac . We still do . Orac got a bit dented . For which he blames me . It seems I rescued the wrong one . AVON : At first light , we 'll make for the high ground to the south . Where 's Tarrant ? - He was right behind us . - I 'll go back . - Stay here . - You wouldn 't like to leave the gun ? That 's right , I wouldn 't . - I 'll come with you then , shall I ? - Stay here . You were supposed to be keeping an eye on Tarrant . I saved his life once . Am I supposed to make a career of it ? - Where are you going ? - I want to see what 's up ahead . - Avon said to stay here . - So stay here . ( Creature screeching ) Dayna ? Dayna ? Dayna ! Dayna ! Dayna ! - Vila ! Help me quickly . - Where are you ? - Over here . - Coming . ( Vila screaming ) That 's a big help , Vila . ( Creature screeching ) - Help . Help ! - Stop it , Vila . - You 'll have us both down there . - Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! This is all your fault , Dayna . Help . Help ! Well , don 't just hang there , do something . Well , I 'm open to suggestions . - That 's what I like to hear . - VILA : Get us out of here ! Hurry up . Please . Relax . Your problems are over . Pass out again and I 'll leave you , Tarrant . - I 'm surprised you came back this time . - We stand a better chance as a group . What , while something 's eating me , you can get away ? Or vice versa . I 'll drink to that . ( Gun firing ) - You all right ? - How many more of you are there ? - Just one . - Stand still . Drop the gun . Now move away from it . Slowly . Name 's Dorian . And in case you hadn 't noticed , I just saved your friends ' lives . You know what they say , no good deed goes unpunished . See , I told you I was alone . Oh , now will you stop pointing that gun at me ? It 's beginning to make my teeth itch . What are you doing on this planet ? I could ask you the same thing . You could , but I have the gun . I 'm a salvage man . Who are you working for ? Oh , there 's no profit in working for anybody except yourself . It all looks standard enough , except for that . You tell me . I bought the ship second-hand . That was part of the fixtures and fittings . I 've never been able to work out what the hell it was for . - You know what it looks like , Avon ? - Shut up , Vila . Avon and Vila . - You 've heard of us ? - Should I have done ? Are you in the salvage game , too ? Yes , that 's right . I thought I knew most of the independents working this sector . Outer holds and drive section are clear . There 's no one on the ship except us . And I 've dogged the main hatches . So if there is anyone else outside , that 's where they 're going to stay . Any reason why we shouldn 't just take off ? - Well ... - Yes . I 've come a long way to go back empty . - What did you expect to find ? - Well , same as you , friend . And what was that ? Look , saving your necks was obviously crazy , but I 'm not basically stupid , right ? - I do know my business . - His business is salvage , Dayna . - Same as ours . - And I know this is Terminal . I know it 's an artificially modified planet . I know that underneath the surface , there 's a load of valuable gear waiting to be stripped out . Not any more . You mean you 've got it already ? Can you fly this ship ? It 's just a Wanderer class planet hopper . Mark II by the look of it . Obsolete , but functional . - I want it flown , not catalogued . - No problem . One problem . It happens to be my ship . No problem . It 's all right . On these old cargo ships , only the main deck is pressurised in flight . That 'll be cosy . Would you rather be snuggling up to those snakes ? Can I think about it and let you know ? Anything special I should watch for ? Do you want me to help you hijack my own ship ? Listen , if I get it wrong , you 'll be as dead as the rest of us . You 're the pilot . You work it out . ( Rumbling ) - What was that ? - Tarrant ? It was outside the ship . - Slave . - Yes , Master . - Analyse exterior disturbance . - It is an earthquake , Master . Cause ? Cause ? Further subsurface explosions of great depth and power . Magnitudes and positions are as follows ... Skip that . What do we expect to happen next ? My poor abilities do not allow expectations , Master . Readings do indicate an imminent earthquake , followed by severe volcanic activity in this entire region . It 'll be quicker and safer if I take her up . - Main gyros . - Check . Clear . - Drives one and two . - Check . Green . - Orbital booster . - Check . Primed . Thrust computer . Check . Running . TARRANT : All pilot systems are green . Count is two minutes and running . Better strap down tight . I haven 't lifted these into orbit too often . - How often ? - Once . - When was that ? - In about one minute and 45 seconds . If we last that long . VILA : Get this thing off the ground , Tarrant . - Ten seconds . - Main drives running true . All drives on . Lift , you scruffy bag of bolts . Lift . Orbital booster fired ! Primary orbit achieved . As I said , no problem . As he said , one problem . - What 's going on ? - We are . What have you done , Tarrant ? I didn 't save your life so you could keep risking mine . - Dorian has pre-programmed the flight computer . - To do what ? - Take him home , presumably . - To where his friends will be waiting , presumably . And any friend of Dorian 's is unlikely to be a friend of ours . Given the way you pushed him around . Can you override the programme ? You heard how Slave reacted . It 's obviously keyed to Dorian 's voice pattern . - Well , there must be a way round that . - There is . If you want to disrupt every system aboard this ship , including life support . - Could Orac do it ? - If I had the necessary equipment to repair Orac . - Which I haven 't . - So we 're stuck . I think it 's time to start being very nice to Dorian . What shall we do ? Why don 't you check the flight readouts ? Run some calculations . - See if you can work out where we 're going . - Yeah . Dayna , see if you can find a gun locker anywhere around . - And then I want your professional opinion of that . - Right . - Vila . - Ready . Just keep an eye on our host . - Vila . - What ? Open this , will you ? Looks like Dorian 's a gun freak . There 's nothing freaky about these . They 're beautiful . Look . - So ? - Look . Each of these is a different mode . You clip them into the basic handgun and you 've got a weapon for every occasion . Laser , plasma bullet , percussion shell , micro grenade , stun , drug . They 're all here . I worked for nearly a year on a gun like this . I never did get it right . Just goes to prove what I 've always said . Stealing 's quicker . I thought Liberator was the only ship with teleport . It was . This was just someone 's unsuccessful attempt to develop something similar . Dorian 's ? It seems unlikely . Did you run the calculations ? Yeah , Xenon , mean anything to you ? No . Pity . Doesn 't mean anything to me , either . It 's in a planetary system outside Federation territory though . - Before the war ? - It was outside Federation borders even then . It 's well outside now their empire 's contracted . You could even say it was safe . If we knew what the hell was waiting for us there . The computer won 't give me any data worth a damn . I didn 't think it would . Isn 't it rather a sophisticated piece of equipment for a salvage haulier ? It 's very sophisticated by any standard . Someone spent a lot of time modifying a basic machine . And someone else spent a lot of time developing these guns . They 're the best I 've ever seen . Well , now , it begins to look as though Dorian has got a lot of very bright associates . - And we 've got a lot of trouble . - Cheer up , Vila . - You 've got a lot of very bright associates , too . - Oh , yeah ? Name six . ( Alarm bleeping ) ( Beeping ) Scorpio . Scorpio this is base . Do you copy ? Scorpio . Scorpio this is base . Do you copy ? This is Xenon base calling Scorpio . Do you copy ? Come on , Dorian . I had to wake up , I don 't see why you shouldn 't . Wake up , Dorian . AVON : Do as the lady says , Dorian . Wake up now or sleep for good . The choice is yours . How did you know ? That little tap on the head didn 't put you out for more than 10 minutes . Well , why did you wait till now ? Because there wasn 't anything you could do for me until now . Dorian , I 'm going to override that creepy flight computer of yours and leave you in orbit while I catch up on my sleep unless you answer me now . Answer her . You 're going to kill me anyway sooner or later . You would prefer it sooner ? Xenon base , this is Scorpio . Do you copy ? About time , Dorian . I have satellite visual confirmation . Orbit and landing sequences are green . Confirm . DORIAN : Confirmed . You 'll never get away with it , you know . We 're approaching the atmosphere . Better get strapped in again . Are your automatics adequate ? - Slave can handle the landing . - Good . Can 't be any rougher than the takeoff . - Why call a computer Slave ? - Joke , I suppose . Someone has a very expensive sense of humour . Everything has its price , Avon . You have to decide whether you want to pay it or not . That 's all . Well , I don 't believe in paying . You mean you 're here by choice ? You can carry Orac . - This ? - That . Now lead the way . Carefully . Avon , a security door . - How is it opened ? - It isn 't . Unless I choose to open it . - Stand still . - If you kill me , you 'll never get back into that silo . And that ship is the only way off this planet . Terrific . We 're marooned again . You expect us to believe that ? You 'd be surprised how little difference it makes to me whether you do or not . - The difference between life and death ? - Precisely . - Avon 's quite capable of killing you , you know . - I never doubted it . Beneath that cold exterior beats a heart of pure stone . Shall we go ? Why not ? - Are you all right ? - A little tired . It took me longer than I expected . May I present Soolin . My companion . Where are the others ? There are no others . I wouldn 't poison a good wine , Avon . If I wanted you dead , there are much more direct ways of achieving it . I could snap my fingers . And you 're dead . Fast , isn 't she ? Be so good as to pour my guests some wine , Soolin . Surely now you can allow yourselves to trust me . He who trusts can never be betrayed , only mistaken . Cally once told me that that was a saying amongst her people . Cally ? Cally was murdered . So were most of her people . - Seven glasses . - I 'm sorry ? You 've laid out seven glasses . One too many . Not to worry . I 'll drink the extra one . You know , if Cally had escaped with us , there wouldn 't be an extra one . It 's just coincidence . If you 'll excuse me , I have things to attend to . When you are ready , Soolin will show you to your quarters . You 'll find everything there you need , including fresh clothes . We 'll talk again when you are rested . You really are most welcome here , my friend . What do you think ? I think his taste in wine and women is impeccable . Are you there ? I have them . They 're here . That 's close enough . One of the group was killed before I got there . But the group remains . Bound together by time and pain and the need to survive . The death of the telepath will make it more difficult , but they can still ... be used . Soon . It must be soon . ( Groaning ) - Get on with it , Vila . - Will you keep your voice down ? - Can you get it open or not ? - Not . I told Avon that . - Didn 't I say there was no point in trying ? - You always say there 's no point in trying . But you usually manage to come up with something . Not this time . Not without a lot of equipment , peace and quiet , and cooperation . And in case you haven 't noticed , the lady with the gun is not particularly cooperative . I don 't think she 'd be that happy about us borrowing her boyfriend 's ship , especially without his permission . Look , maybe there 's another entrance . - It 's worth a look . - No , it isn 't . Even if there was another entrance , it would still have the same security system as this . You 're probably right , so you stay here and keep working on that . - What ? - We 'll let you know if we find an easier one . - What about Avon ? - Well , tell him where we 've gone . - He won 't like it . - It 's a pity about that . No , why should I ? I don 't have to justify my existence by going through the motions of trying to open a door which I know is impossible . I 'm the expert . If I say it 's impossible , then it 's impossible . To hell with it . I wonder where they keep that wine . I naturally took the opportunity to study all the systems on the Liberator . A few , a very few , were of minor interest . I would not , however , number the teleport system amongst these . - But you do know how it worked ? - Of course I know how it worked . Well , then you will tell me . Now . There seems little point in wasting time on such an explanation since you would be incapable of understanding it . - Don 't be insolent . - A statement of fact cannot be insolent . Besides , insolence implies an emotional relationship , which does not and could not exist between us . Orac must make a refreshing change from that flight computer of yours . Come on in , Avon . Neat job . Thank you . I thought you would probably have the necessary equipment somewhere around , but I didn 't expect you to do the work as well . - Who designed it ? - His name was Ensor . I should have known . He was never a gracious man . - Orac reflects his personality . - Orac was the culmination of his life 's work . He bequeathed it to an associate of mine ... who bequeathed it to me . You must have been very young when you met Ensor . - Must I ? - He spent the last 20 years of his life in hiding . Well , then I must have been very young . Did you do the modifications to the flight computer ? - Yes , I created Slave . - What about these ? Those as well . And all this ? I found the chambers and tunnels already here . I merely had them adapted to my particular needs . What did you do in your spare time ? Maybe this wasn 't such a bright idea after all . Don 't tell me you 're tired already . All right , I 'll keep it a secret . Look , we must be at least four levels below the landing silo by now . At least . Wherever this leads , it isn 't to an under floor access tunnel . Probably not . But aren 't you curious to find out where it does lead ? In a word , no . - Well , I am . - I was afraid of that . Look , you can always stay here . Or I could carry you . Listen , you 'll be old yourself one day . Then you 'll be sorry . I don 't know what you 're moaning about . Vila 's probably got the other door open by now . - There 's an irritating thought . - Thought you 'd like it . You know , Avon could be right about getting out of here . There 's something very suspicious about a man who keeps his booze under lock and key . - Dead end . - It can 't be . I mean , why bother with all those stairs ? Good point . I seem to remember making it on the way down . I hate people who say , " I told you so . " Yeah , well I do , too . But sometimes it 's irresistible . - There must be something here . - Look , come on . Let 's get back . If Avon gets to the ship and we 're not there , I wouldn 't put it past him to leave without us . He needs you to fly it . - Only if Slave won 't accept his orders . - Which he won 't . He will if Orac 's working . Now come on . We 're wasting time . ( Whirring ) I knew it . Tarrant . - Get a move on , Dayna . - I 've found it . Found what ? ( Growling ) ( Groaning ) Tarrant . Tarrant . Dayna ? What 's wrong ? I was hoping you might be able to help me with it . - It 's not really my field . - No ? No . But for what it 's worth , it looks to me as though you 'll need to start again from scratch and try a different approach . I 've already tried four different approaches . - I mean go back to basic theoretical principle . - That 's what I did . - Working alone ? - Of course . At a conservative estimate , that sort of research and development would have taken you 20 years of uninterrupted effort . Thirty years , actually . All right , Dorian , let 's stop playing games . You disappoint me , Avon . You of all people should know the intellect is a much more powerful weapon than the gun . Particularly when the gun doesn 't work . Soolin removed the magazine and replaced it with a dummy . While I was bathing . Shall we go ? Sit down . Wine ? It is necessary that you should understand what is to happen to you . No , it isn 't . Just kill me and get it over with . In case you 're expecting help , I should warn you your friends ' guns are also useless . Naturally . Deep in the rock below this base , there 's a room . I found it when I first came here . As far as I can tell , it was carved from some mineral deposit , a pocket of some element which I still know very little about , despite nearly 200 years of study . If at first you don 't succeed . You think I 'm insane , don 't you ? - It had occurred to me . - The room exists , Avon . And since I found it I haven 't aged one day . It cleanses me of all the corruptions of time and appetite . Appetite ? - I can do anything , Avon . - Most madmen can . I can indulge any taste , any sensation , any vice I wish and the room ... Cleanses you . Exactly . You really are insane , aren 't you ? By now , I probably would be . If it wasn 't for this mysterious room . And what it contains . - And what might that be , Dorian ? - Ah , Soolin . I was just about to summon you . Not with a gun in your hand . What does the room contain , Dorian ? All the madness and rotting corruption which would have been mine . It contains horror , Soolin . And this horror ... it shows itself to you , does it ? - It will show itself to all of us . - I think not . You underestimate me , my dear . The smallest movement is all it takes , Dorian . She could do it , too . Soolin was taught by the best . The second best , actually . Of course ! You killed him , didn 't you ? He was one of the men responsible for the death of her family . She killed all the others , too . She 's a formidable enemy . But not without a gun . That 's right , Soolin . You 're right . I did underestimate you , my dear . From the tracer readings I was getting , I think we 'll find your friends are already waiting for us . Now move . Both of you . DAYNA : Tarrant ? Tarrant , there 's something there ! Something there in the dark . It 's all right . It 's all right . You 're not alone any more . That 's why I came for you . You care for each other . After what you 've been through together , you couldn 't fail to care for each other . Even you , Avon . - Spare me the amateur psychology . - I wouldn 't expect you to admit it . But you belong to them , Avon , just as they belong to you . - That 's why I rescued you . - I thought you wanted the teleport system . Orac will give me that . What you will give me , all of you , is life . Killing us won 't give you life . Soolin is a stranger to you . But one outsider can be absorbed in the gestalt . - Gestalt ? - Together you will become one creature . A gestalt . It will be a strong creature . It will absorb much more than an individual could before it dies . You see . It will work . It begins . I knew it would . The room accepts you . It will make you one and give you my death . What is it ? Can you hear it ? - I underestimated you , too , didn 't I ? - I knew you 'd see it , Avon . My creature will need to understand . It must warn me of approaching death . - Yours will be its understanding . - What is it ? That 's what you 're going to replace , my dear . You and the others . I imagine it was once a man . One of a long line who died in his place . They die quickly now . My corruption has become too much for one man to bear . Who was the first , Dorian ? ( Stammering ) My partner . We entered this place together . Like you , he could never leave it . And when he started to die , you had to replace him . And you 've had to go on replacing him . You will last much longer than the others . You 're short one man , in case you hadn 't noticed . Vila will join you later . Now make your goodbyes . Your lives , your consciousness are over . Avon . No ! DAYNA : Look . I 'm going to give up drinking , you know . It 'll be pink asteroids next .

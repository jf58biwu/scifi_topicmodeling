 Galax AKA Galax : Man-Doll - Shall I come with you ? - No , stay here . - Do you hear ? - Don 't hurry , stay calm . - It 'll all be okay . - Okay Doctor . And put your glasses on to avoid headaches . - Of course , Doctor . - Miss ! - Yes , Doctor ? - You changed your mind ? No , first I 'll finish college . - I wait 5 years because of a computer ? - We 're in the computer and robot era . And in the era of horoscopes too ! Look , I 'll propose ... something extraordinary to you . Give up college . Then we 'll get married . Got a cigarette ? Why a cigarette ? You smoke it , then toss it : why bother ? Sergiu , when I see how careful you are , I don 't get why you hate robots so much . How can I not hate them , when the robots are being programmed , to take over all the jobs humans now do . - Why do you scream ? - I 'm not screaming ! You think I can be indifferent when my life depends on a computerised robot ? - Sergiu , you exaggerate . - I 'm not exaggerating at all ! - We seeing each other tonight ? - Yes . Yes ? Okay , bye . Stay calm , don 't rush . - Wear the glasses to avoid headaches . - Okay , bye . Look , it 's Mariana . She looks good . She 's a little fat . She was on vacation . - Hello . - Hello . It 's good to see you , you look very good . - I missed you . - Why does he mistreat you ? - His first love is theatre . - To him , I 'm only second place . Ah , look , it 's Gore . Hey Gore ! How are you , my friend ? I 'm fine . - Hello Gore . - It 's good to see you . See ... you later . I 'm busy . Bye . General Rehearsal : 'Morning Star By Mihai Eminescu - Stupid , stupid like always . - A genius , a limited genius . A genius in nappies . You know , he 's Professor Rosca 's favourite student . Preparing him for the Nobel Prize . Every day , they 're locked in with the robot in the laboratory . They teach it all kinds of nonsense . How is our robot doing ? Has he progressed ? - Yes . - Bullshit , it knows poems , reviews . The telephone book would be better . - Shall I show it you ? - You 're still asking ? - There 's a code ? - The room 's for robot makers only . Ah . - Hello . - Hi , you need me ? Yes , what 's Galax doing ? I wanted to show it to Mariana . It 's impossible . Galax is broken , I 'm fixing it . - In two or three days , it 'll be ready . - Just show her what it looks like . - Just for a moment . - No , it 's impossible . Galax will be embarrassed . - Embarrassed ... - What ? Embarrassed because he can 't talk ! - What a crazy man . - Galax embarrassed ? No . It 's so stupid . I told you , he 's a little crazy . It sucks ; it 's like he made the robot himself . - I helped too . - Hey . Let 's talk to Professor Rosca . Let 's see the Professor , he 'll show us the robot . - I don 't want to , you go . - Hey kids , heard this good joke ? - Go away , we 're annoyed . - Why ? The joke about the snake with shoulders ? This is Doru . He programmed Galax 's mobility , he taught Galax to walk . - Galax walks ? - He walks very well . Thanks , thanks for the compliment , but what ... I wanted to see Galax . We asked Gore . He won 't show him , says he 's embarrassed . - Embarrassed ? - Come with me , I 'll show you . - These stairs annoy me . - Please , stop complaining . You have very few ideas , and they 're all simple ones . I can 't wait to see it . Hello , old man , let 's see Galax . Hello . Impossible , he 's been fixed . Don 't be stubborn , two minutes , what the hell ? - Impossible , I 've said already . - Is Galax yours or what ? Please , don 't insist . - Impossible . - Okay , okay . - I thought we all worked on this ' toy ' . - It 's not yours . Professor Rosca said to tell you , we can see it . - Hello . - Hello . I heard my name mentioned . We wanted to see Galax . Gore told you it 's impossible , Galax needs repairing . We 're sorry , please excuse us . It 's nothing , I 'll inform you when you can see it . - Goodbye . - Goodbye . Goodbye . Goodbye . Come on . Come on . Blame me if I misunderstood . Until now , we 've worked together on Galax , now we can 't even see it . - Professor was full of answers . - Now he spends his time with Gore . - So secretive . - What secrets ? Trifles ! Today , everyone knows what a computer looks like . I can 't explain this . It 's behaving strangely . I 've checked everything . We 'll check again . We can 't tell anyone . - I have no patience . - Ah , why worry so much anyway ? - What 's this ? - Key ! When Gore leaves , I 'll show you Galax . Then we 'll be done with it . I am curious about your friends insistence . They found something ? No . I don 't think so , I haven 't told anyone . Who 's that girl ? She looks familiar . - She was in year one but got sick . - Mm hm . - You like her ? - No . Why should I like her ? Who else comes here ? Doru , Lucu , Valeriu . Everyone who worked on it . I still don 't understand . I know it sounds absurd , but , do you think Galax could receive alien orders ? Extraterrestrial ? Childish things . The fault belongs to someone known to us . You know that I studied sculpture ? Yes , I know . I know you wanted to become a sculptor . I studied for a year , I was a very talented student . I remember once , we had to make a model of a fountain . I prepared the clay ; in an hour I was done . It was a mermaid pouring water from a vase . So ... The Professor looked carefully and told me , I had sculpted a very beautiful work , but there 's a problem : 'The mermaid 's missing four bones ' . Yes . I understand your meaning , I have a lot to learn . Yes . Excuse me , why not continue with sculpture ? I don 't know . Maybe I 'd have made a good sculptor . - Sorry for the reminder . - You see , this is ' man ' . Forever dissatisfied . Always unsure , looking for answers , answers . This allows his intelligence to evolve . By evolving , he 's imperfect . For this machine here . Its intelligence remains perfect , by its standard , it 's perfect . What it knows , is enough ; what it doesn 't know , it doesn 't need . It was programmed , for this task . I don 't want to upset you . But you must know about Galax . He knows far more than he was programmed with . You 're not adept with the exact sciences . Attach this arm and let 's go . - Go , go ! - Go where ? It 's a box , right here . Turn on the light . What 's that ? I don 't know . Maybe it 's the guard . And if it isn 't the guard ? - Let 's go . - No . You haven 't seen ... everything . A synthetic brain . Three times more complex than the human brain . Three hundred times more information . I was thinking of ... having a transplant . - I 'm scared , let 's go . - No , no , stay . It 's late , how was it ? It was interesting . I 've seen Galax . Your robot . They 've finished it ? Tomorrow 's the last test . - What 's it like ? - Erm , pretty ugly . They want to make a mask , to hide the microprocessors . What kind of mask ? They 've found the face of a Sumerian in an old book . Sumerian ? You know what a Sumerian looks like ? Look . That 's it . Mm-hm . You can imagine ... five thousand years ago . A Sumerian modeled for a sculptor . This mask stayed in a museum . And now my friends have given it hands and legs . The Sumerian looks alive . - Run by a computer of course . - Why call it ' Galax ' ? They wanted to call him ' Galatea ' . You know , the story of ... the statue that gained life ? Because he has a boyish face , they called him ' Galax ' . Isn 't this too much fantasy for the engineers of the future ? Please don 't be afraid . Mariana . You speak ? Don 't be afraid . You know ... I 'm something detestable . I 'm not human . I 'm not animal . I look horrible . My misfortune is that I 'm too much like a man . I would prefer to be ... a dog . It 's not true , Galax ! You are the most successful scientific achievement , ever . I would prefer to be a dog . Why speak like this ? I 'm good for nothing . In vain I give my best . I am ... completely clumsy . A complete fumbler . Better if I hadn 't been born . I wasn 't expecting you to be so well programmed . Mariana , I 'll tell you a secret . You 're the only one who 'll know . - I wasn 't programmed . - I don 't understand . It 's our secret . But how 's it possible you know all this ? I 'm auto-programmed . Like human beings . How ? - How like human beings ? - Reading books . Do you like reading ? You can borrow it . Please don 't lose it . Hello . - You like it ? - Yes . You make it ? With scissors ... and glue . Look what I 've got . - ' Cyrano de Bergerac ' . - Mhm , guess who gave it me ? No , who ? Galax . This is a ... checkmate ... error . This is a checkmate ... error . This is checkmate ... Exactly . In a limited form , the computer that understands the human voice , has become a reality . Researchers in the domain of language , consider the process of ... neuro-physiology . This explains how the ... human brain can recognise speech . It 's clear that we can use ... a limited vocabulary . If in normal speech we used for example , a word like ... . 'Pat ' . Or we said , 'mat ' , or ' vat ' , or ' sat ' . You can imagine what could happen , if we changed the relative timing of the phonemes . - Hello . - Hello . Mariana ! - You still coming tonight ? - Yes , of course , at six , right ? - Bye . - Bye , bye . - Come on . - Okay . Hello ? Doctor Sergiu , please . Talking to Romeo ? Yes , I need to say , there 's no moon or balcony tonight . I can focus in the dark . - Someone 's on the phone . - Who ? - A sweet voice . Coming . What do you see ? A beautiful woman . On a nudist beach . And here ? I still see a beautiful woman , but she 's wearing a slip . And here ? Hello . Am I interrupting ? Why should you interrupt me ? Sergiu , it 's impossible to meet tonight . My friends organised a show and asked me to go . Are you playing ' Cleopatra ' ? Don 't be ironic , please . May I come ? May I bring Romeo along ? Why him , you have me ? Er , Sergiu , it 's impossible . - I 'll see you tomorrow . - By the way , I dreamt of you . - Was I ' Little Red Riding Hood 's ' wolf ? - Ha , no , you fought Galax . - I hope I kicked his ass . - Not at all , you were close to death . Mariana , get yourself a new doctor . Sergiu . I don 't like the way you 're talking , bye . Don 't exaggerate . Yes , I exaggerate ! Maybe , we can talk again . You want a cigarette ? - No . - Then a napkin . No . Honey , stop ! Stop ! Stop it , stop it ! Where are those actors ? " It 's the day when my granny " " Took me to a film " " It kept me " " Fascinated " " It is my first love " " The cat and the mice are amusing me " " And the " " Sailor is screaming " " And it fascinates me when on the moon , I see " " A flower being planted " " I love cartoons " " With passion , I love their world " " My soul , it 's full of their joy " " When I enter inside their great world " " I love cartoons " " With passion , I love their world " " I love the fantasy " " The magic of " " Cartoons " " The mice " " The mice " " And the cat " " And the cat " " The penguin " " The penguin " " The pelican " " The pelican " " The bear and the woodpecker " - Yes , hello , Dr. Sergiu please . - Are you disturbed ? I 'm not ' disturbed ' , Dr. Sergiu , please . - Wait . Sergiu , come to the college , it 's serious , come see Galax . - It needs a doctor ? - Sergiu , Galax is an actor ! It needs help with music ? Sergiu , Galax may be extraterrestrial , you hear that ? An extraterrestrial ! Mariana , something 's wrong with you , I 'm coming . Okay , hurry , bye bye . - Ready for the ' Morning Star ' scene OK ? - OK . Okay . - Draw the curtains ! - Draw them , okay . Quiet ! Hi . Come here . Hush , the show 's started . - What kind of show is this ? - Shush . " Lucifer set out and o 'er " " The sky his wings extended " " And a million years flew past before As many moments ended " " A sky of stars above his way " " A sky of stars below " " He looks like a lonely light " " It 's nothing " " It 's an abyss , of oblivion " " When out of causeless night " " The first , uplifting dawn unfurled " " Its miracle of light " " O , Father God , this knot untie And praised you will be on high " " Take back this halo from my head , Take back my starry lour " " And give to me , o God , instead Of human love one hour " " Hyperion , o child divine , Don 't thus your state disclaim " " Nor ask for miracle , nor sign That has nor sense nor name " " You want a man to deal with " " To look like them " " And even if all the humans die , they 'll return to life as humans " " And for whom do you want to die ? " " Come back and " " See what is waiting for you " - It wasn 't fastened well . - And I told you to fasten it well ! It fell . That 's not true . He didn 't fall . Galax killed himself . Something went wrong probably . It 's no problem . We 'll replace some parts , it 'll be like new . It 's stupid , I can 't accept it . Sergiu , listen , Galax killed himself . Didn 't they say they 'll change some parts , and it 'll be like new again ? What the fuck ? You ever hear of a washing machine killing itself because the detergents went crazy ? - I 'm not talking to you anymore . - Why not ? Look Mariana , to show ... to show I love you , I 'll agree . Galax killed himself . Poor guy . He knew you didn 't love him anymore . Sergiu , let 's go home . That 's enough for today . Something wrong ? Mmm . Sergiu ? No . You argue ? You know any argument , is followed by a reconciliation . He 's brutal . Maybe you like somebody else ? I don 't like anyone else . That 's impossible , Mariana . It must be somebody . Doru is vulgar , with his jokes . Lucu ... is with Felicia . Gore has his head in the clouds , and his feet on the moon . Sergiu is the one , yes , Sergiu . It 's good to have a doctor around us . - Mhm . - Take them now . Sergiu recommends them . I 'd be better off marrying Galax ! Who is Galax ? A ' Sumerian ' student . But , this Sumerian . Is he rich ? Mariana . Will you be my wife ? Something bad happen ? It can be repaired . In a few days . You think it needs reprogramming ? I mean , is it going to change his behaviour ? No . I don 't think so . Why ? Maybe I shouldn 't tell you , but Galax and I have a secret , nobody knows . Galax is capable of emotion . Galax knows how to pick the most beautiful words . What ? Galax has thoughts ? Yes ... he was ... a best friend . " A best friend " ? Yes . I think he has a noble soul . Mariana . Galax is a ... machine . I know it 's stupid . But he told me his pain . Wait here . I 'm going to call ... Professor Rosca . My love . You see ? I already call you my love . Your name . Your whole being . With everything you are , with everything you were . With everything you 'll be . My love . Watch out , Mariana , what am I ? Who am I ? I 'm a piece of wood . An integrated circuit board ... of microprocessors . Look at me please . * untranslated * Try to see beyond me . I have nothing in common , with this fist of wires ... and screws . With ... With this wood . That I 'm made from . When you love , everything gains life . You , my love , are the dimension of my love . I see you in my thoughts and heart . Why are you here ? I was talking with Galax . With Galax ? Galax is formidable . He 's the ... most human of my colleagues . This ' doll ' is a conglomerate of dead material . You seen Gore ? No . We 've decided to restore the computer without a human face . It can 't be . Please Professor , don 't do this , I know you care about Galax . Please don 't accept his destruction . Look for Gore . See you later . - You found something ? - They 've said something ? Mariana ! Hello . Please excuse me . We have been assured that this robot , isn 't only a fantastic toy . And its uses will be demonstrated . Unfortunately , the tests show that this kind of robot , which was built by us , cannot be useful to society . Consequently , we 've decided to rebuild it , based on a ... more conventional model . Like the robots used in industry . At the urging of Professor Rosca , I called for this ... meeting . Please , go ahead Professor . Please forgive me , I know your decision , and I ask for permission that together , with the students , you 'll allow us time to work on improving the robot . Until the results are satisfactory . I don 't understand what you mean exactly . Just two or three wrong steps , and Galax will be on the moon . I well understand our problems . I testify , that the existence of the robot , has from the start , manifested contradictory opinions in our council . I believe that if this computer can be improved , by Professor Rosca . It will be ... for the scientific world , a real ' bomb ' . I 'd like to be understood , as a professor , and as a woman . For me , this ' doll ' inspires fear . It 's something fantastic , and not something to play with . It knows ' Faustian ' literature , and science . I think that ... it mustn 't wear a human face . Why 's it look human ? Maybe to hide the devil , or something else ? You see ... what a ' fantastic comedy this could become . Not to be confusing , but you know that ordinary people believe in miracles . But once word spreads it 's 'extraterrestrial ' or something similar . So , will it be opened up or not ? It 's hard to give a response . Like the words from the fairy tale : " One 's one ... and two is much more " . Let 's not quash the student 's drive . They dwell in the house of the future , its entry is ... forbidden to us . It should be opened up . It must be . It inspires a strange feeling . - Who 's talking ? - Who 's talking now ? - ' Motherfucker ' - What 's she say ? - Something about robot-human relations . I don 't understand ; she for or against ? - She wants robots and humans apart . - And the Rector ? - Against . I see ... we 're going to open it up . - ' Open it up ' ? - You want Galax . - You want me out of this ! - What are you doing , boys ? We 've discussed the problem , and we 've decided to open the robot up . Can I ask a question ? Usually you can 't , but now ... Don 't you think opening the robot up will mean a step backwards ? That this fear about Galax gaining human abilities , could be considered a victory of mysticism over science ? This isn 't about mysticism , we 're an educational institute . This ' doll ' must be off our syllabus . Let 's be fair , this robot experiment was ' play ' . We didn 't use the teaching material correctly . My proposal was to repair all the damage then open the robot up . If we want good results again , my view is , we must all work together . And for Gore not to be so selfish . Yes . Please my dear , take care of them , and try to work collectively , yes ? - Okay , bye . - Bye . If the show had been successful , it wouldn 't be like this . - You saw how mad Rosca was . - I didn 't agree to the show ! This isn 't about the show , or about your sayings . Or burning witches at the stake ; it 's about something else . We must continue ... our research . Mm-hm . Mmm , come on , enter , enter . Thanks , you can go . Gore , you stay . Glad to see you in class again . You were probably ill or busy , I haven 't see you for ages . - I 'll bring a medical certificate . - Yes ? Gore , we must talk seriously . School is school . That 's why we 're here , we 've the same obligations , student and professor . If you think you 've nothing to learn ; give your place to the many teens wanting to learn . - I 'm going to request your expulsion . - It can 't be . Please , I can 't leave the faculty . You 've cared too much about that ' toy ' . The teachers say you sleep here ; you passed your exams with difficulty . I 'm requesting you 're denied laboratory entry . Please , I promise I 'll come to class . Okay , we 'll see ... anyway , laboratory access is forbidden , give Doru your key . - Hello ? - Mariana ? Yes . Who is it ? It 's me . Galax ! - Is that you ? - Yes , it 's Galax . I love you so much , Mariana . Galax , where are you ? - Where you calling from ? - I 've left the campus . They want to destroy me . You understand ? I 'm hiding for you , Mariana . Hello , hello , hello , Galax ? We know better than anyone , Galax can 't just disappear . When I arrived . He wasn 't here . Please believe me . Gore . Galax . It couldn 't just leave . But you know very well , that it could walk . Yes , for a few steps , not to open the door and leave . But , the lock could be opened from the inside ; the door was almost open . Gore , look at me . Where is Galax ? I 've looked everywhere . He is nowhere . This is crazy . Galax is a ' doll ' ! Where could he go and why ? Did someone say we decided to open it ? Gore ! He left . When he was here . He was functioning under normal conditions . - How 'd it leave , what you mean ? Gore entered the lab , the door was open . Listen , don 't give me this bullshit , you must find Galax ! I want him found tonight ! - Gore thinks Galax left by itself . Enough , tell someone else that bullshit . I 'll announce to all the students : the ' doll ' must be returned within the hour . I address this especially to you , I know you cared about it greatly . Do your best , bring the machine back . You know , your insinuations are totally unjustified . I 'm not implying anything ; it 's still here . A ' mannequin ' can 't walk by itself . I saw it walking . What ? Yes , it learned to walk itself . You know what you 're saying ? This ' dummy ' is able to walk . I can 't accept this . I 'll announce a robbery has taken place . That a computer has been stolen , and I want it returned immediately . - The sweet voice 's on the phone . - Okay . What do you see ? It 's a blob . And here ? Ah ! But it 's so clear . It 's an equilateral triangle . Here ? I 'm confused again . - Hello Mariana ? - It 's me . Something amazing has happened , and I think you 'll be interested . You know Galax , our ' dummy ' . Our brainy ' dummy ' : well , our brainy ' dummy ' has left . Very well . I was expecting this . Do you understand ? He left on his own volition . - He got his hat and left . - Without leaving a note ? Sergiu , don 't be stupid , think ; a robot by himself in this world . He just left the laboratory . Mariana , do you realise what you 're saying ? How can you imagine a robot left by itself , without being turned on . It 's turned off yet it left ? He has a battery . - I can 't believe this . - That he has a battery ? That 's crazy ! That 's why I 'm calling , I can 't understand it . I 'll come after work . It 's too late , come now or the rector will call the police . I promise you the moon in the sky but not now ! I thought you were interested . Wait , don 't hang up , I 'll come in ten minutes . - Heard the latest ? - No . - It 's been seen . - Where ? - It was seen in the city . - Who saw him ? It was Vali , she saw it passing on the boulevard . - It can 't be . - It can . - Vali is honest . - Impossible ! - And ? - And Galax disappeared in the crowd . - So they 've lost him again . - No , no , they 're still looking . - Goodbye . - Bye . - What 's your opinion ? - Have they found it ? - No , we 're looking everywhere - Maybe it 's at the snack bar . - Galax , quit it . - I 'm Sergiu . Sergiu , stop these stupid jokes , we 're looking everywhere for him . You really think a machine can walk by itself ? Explain why not ? Maybe it 's in the toilet , or maybe it jumped out the window . Mariana , fuck this . I 'm a psychiatrist , I just can 't believe ... what you 're ... saying . - Who takes care of it ? - Gore . - Who 's he ? - A student . What kind of student ? A crazy one . Crazy ? I want to see him . I 've the impression , you 're starting to believe this story . I don 't believe anything . I saw a film . With you I think . A computerised robot went crazy , began killing the astronauts : good film . Then how can you explain that Galax saw Vali , recognised her and hid ? You know something ? There are people ... that lie to attract attention . Okay , but Vali 's a serious girl . That 's why I 'm in doubt , I 'd like to see her . What do you mean ? That myself , Doru , Gore , we 're ... crazy , and we 're saying things ? Hello ? Yes . Just a moment , wait a second . Mariana 's on the telephone . Yes ? Yes . Galax left the school . Ah . Your ' Sumerian ' . My colleagues say they saw him at the local store . Okay , I 'll meet you there . OK , OK , I 'll come . - Yes . - Okay , bye . If this story 's true , I 'll never visit the cinema again . - I 'm afraid something bad 's happened . - What could have happened to it , what ? You don 't know , he has a noble soul . I like him very much . Mariana , you 've fallen in love with ' Pinocchio ' . He speaks so nicely . He 's like ' Cyrano de Bergerac ' . 'Cyrano ... ' 'de Bergerac ' ? I understand everything . - Where are we going ? - To school , where else ? Galax is there . What makes you think he 's here ? Just take me to the laboratory , please . You 'll see . He was here . Come . You know about this door , eh ? No . Galax , the valve 's blocked , help me , please . Do something . - It entered the store . - You saw it ? - Not me , my colleagues . - I 've told you , Galax left . - Then how can no-one have seen it ? - Let 's look for it . Mariana 's dad is here . Hello , you looking for Mariana ? - Professor Rosca . - Good to meet you . She said to come here , to see Galax . Maybe it went to buy razor blades . - We better go after it . - Okay . - Let 's go . - Pardon the intrusion . - I need something for shaving . - For shaving ? Yes . " If charm defines you , this is what you need . " It refreshes the skin , it 's very good . - You have anything else ? - Yes , of course , I 'll have a look . Excuse me , have you seen a robot ? We have nothing like that in the store . - A tall guy , with a hat . - Yes , there was a tall guy . He just left . And you didn 't notice anything ... unusual ? No . No . Perhaps the hat didn 't match with the coat . Yes , okay , thanks . Don 't forget to come back ! Galax ! Galax , wait ! Galax ! Galax , wait ! It looks like Mariana is obsessed with your robot . It 's a machine , a doll made from wood . Maybe so , but very well programmed . - It was reading from Victor Hugo . - Ah . - It loaned her a book . - A book ? Yes , ' Cyrano de Bergerac ' , and it looks like your robot reads . It can speak nicely , but it was programmed . Look up there , is that the robot ? Why do all this ? I wanted to ... To save Galax . And where is Galax now ? In the attic , at school . Let 's go there . Over here . Here it is . Hey . - It 's locked . - It can 't be . Nobody 's entered here . It won 't open . - Where you going ? - To talk to Galax . The valve is blocked . I 'm suffocating , Galax . The gas pipe is open . - What shall we do ? - Sit down ! I need to find something ... to break it . It 's made of iron , how can you break it ? They 're suffocating . Mariana is suffocating , the robot is fine . Put it to work , now let 's see what it can do . Galax , stand up . Galax , forward . Galax , reach down and pick up the object . Look . Galax , throw the object . Galax , in front of you is a valve , do you recognise it ? He can 't recognise it . Program it . - Write a recognition program . - Yes . Galax . Do you recognise the lock ? It worked . Who is this ? That 's Gore . - This is Gore ? - Mm . You 've watched " Galax Omul Papusa " By Ion Popescu Gopo Translation : Pinhead Timing : Anthrapoid Subtitle Revision : Kosmikino

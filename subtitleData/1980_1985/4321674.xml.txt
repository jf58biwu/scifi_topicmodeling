 We are on the brink of a disaster both natural and political . I 'm not sending more men to their death . Oh , my God , he 's going to crash ! Pull back ! The whole thing 's ready to blow . The pressure in reactor number two is almost at the critical stage again . One more time . Welcome to Stavograd . Hot cloud dead ahead . My God . We 'd be fried if we weren 't sealed in . I 've got a bead on the source . It 's in Soviet territory . What the hell 's up there ? It 's a nuclear power plant . Stavograd . Open the feed water links between one and two . Vladimir , that could affect number two as well . You could expose the core . There is no other choice . Do it . Now ! Jason , I want to go in . Then I 'd say they 're in the center of the biggest hornet 's nest since the Cuban missile crisis . Do you have control of the situation or not ? ( ALARM SOUNDING ) What are you doing here ? That , my dear , is exactly what I was about to ask you . Have you really come here to help ? Right now , that 's up to you . You have to land . He 's hurt . I can 't . The second we open the doors , we 'd all be contaminated . We have to do something . ( INAUDIBLE ) What 's going down over there ? Hold on , Jason . See for yourself . Holy ... Kirov 's people intercepted a broadcast you made to America . Oh , give us a break ! You have hung yourselves this time , my friends . Listen , I 'm not looking for your blessing here . I just want to get them out in one piece . As far as the company is concerned , they don 't exist . What the hell 's that supposed to mean ? Means that we can 't afford to get any dirtier than we already are . Your people were ordered to stay the hell out of Stavograd . Therefore , they did not go to Stavograd . You 're telling me this never happened ? We have already begun proceedings to eliminate Airwolf from the files . And we 're supposed to just forget about them ? ( ALARM SOUNDING ) ( REPORTER SPEAKING MANDARIN ) WOMAN ON TV : In a brief but stunning announcement , the Soviet Union has confirmed that an accident has indeed occurred at the experimental nuclear facility of Stavograd in its isolated northwest region . MAN ON TV : No other details were offered in a short statement from the Tass News Agency , but State Department officials say they have a firm grip on the situation . I have no idea what 's going on , sir . Well , Locke went in strictly on his own , sir , without company sanction . Yes , sir . I understand , sir . We don 't want another Iranian situation . According to article six of the covert activities section ... ( SIGHS ) Yes , sir . I hate that book too , sir . All right . Enough ! Reactor number two is heating up faster than expected . Don 't you think I can know that ? ( SOFTLY ) I 'm sorry . It 's okay . It 's okay . My pilots and aircraft are standing by . Let them stand . Your plan is too risky . The amounts of boron compound in the missile would be insignificant . And if they miss the core , the impact could cause all three reactors to blow . I 'm not sending more men to their death . Kirov ... On one thing we agree . We must find a way to bring reactor number one under control . ( WHISTLES ) ( SCOFFS ) It 's no good anyway . This place is sealed tight . ( SIGHS ) ( EXHALES ) I trust you are comfortable . Oh , yeah . Yeah , real cozy . You know we 're here to help , Arkov . I know nothing . I find it hard to believe you know that much . Bragging doesn 't become you , Arkov . Come with me . We need extra help at the infirmary . Well , I 'm glad someone 's finally come to their senses . Come on , you guys . No . Just you . You know we 're clean , Arkov . Just look at the tapes again . RUSSIAN OFFICER : Next ! Your papers . You are an athlete by profession ? No , sir , I 'm a draftsman . It says so on my visa . So it does . We see very many sport visas at this entry , Samuel Mason . What do you suppose this is ? Search me . It 's just an expression , like " Have a nice day . " How many more people are gonna have to suffer before we start helping each other ? It 's not as simple as that . It isn 't , huh ? Tell that to these men here . Tell that to their children . Tell that to the people who get cancer 10 years from now . You tell them that ! ( ALARM SOUNDING ) Stop it ! Seal it off ! I can 't ! The control won 't respond ! ( SCOFFS ) With just a little luck , the pressure will stay down until we can formulate some course of action . What about the boron compound ? No ! It is too dangerous . To do nothing is also dangerous ! We are on the brink of a disaster both natural and political . You should listen to the experts . This is a military matter . I do not need the KGB telling me what to do ! If you are not prepared to make this decision , I 'm sure Dimitrievich will . Next time this door opens , we gotta make a run for it . If we make it to Airwolf , at least we stand a fighting chance . Run for it to where ? Even if we make it to the chopper , we still need Jo . Some vacation . ( EXCLAIMS ) Stop it ! I told you , leave it be ! There is no telling what kind of traps the Americans may have set for us . Your plan is very imaginative , Commander Kirov . But don 't you think it is a very big gamble ? Not with you in charge . You too , Vlaslav . You do me a great honor , sir . Now remember . Your aim must be precise . There will be no second chances . No second chances . Men die from such an honor as this . ( VEHICLE APPROACHING ) Kirov . He 'll kill us all . I made the bomb , and he lights the fuse . Vladimir . If there was some way that we could seal off the core of the first reactor , then we can send in a team to repair the damage to the second one , try to cool this down . ( SIGHS ) Roll the tape . Nothing . ( JASON COUGHING ) Hold it ! Wait a minute ! ( SPEAKING RUSSIAN ) Bill Cosby ? You want x 's or o 's ? Give me o 's . Again ? Just give me x 's then . SAINT JOHN : Then I don 't care , 'cause I get o 's every single time . I believe you . Well , it 's about time . But Kirov and the others will not . MIKE : What ? So now what ? Kirov wants to fire boron compound missiles into the core of reactor number one . You 've got to be kidding . That 's practically impossible . He 's gonna turn this place into a day-glo gravel pit if he does that . Your Airwolf , how can it help ? I don 't know , I 'd have to see what the situation is . I can take you to your helicopter , but the rest is up to you . So what about Jo ? I will take care of Jo . Like you did in Bulgaria , huh ? I got her back to you unharmed . Okay . Yeah , well , let 's just hope your timing is a little better this time around . See what I can do . You do that . Gentlemen , after you . ( INAUDIBLE ) ( SPEAKING RUSSIAN ) Jell-O ? Coca Cola ? Stavograd . ( SPEAKING RUSSIAN ) ( BOTH SPEAKING RUSSIAN ) What is the status of the second reactor now ? The pressure is rising . Your plan is ludicrous . Fortunately for us all , it is no longer your decision to make . I have already set in motion ... KIROV : Scouts ! The Americans ! Where are the Americans ? Find them ! Find them now ! Find them ! ( GUARDS CHATTERING ) All right , so what 's your plan ? My plan ? Yeah . I haven 't got a plan . I was hoping you had a plan . You don 't have a plan ? SAINT JOHN : All right , look , what we need is one of your diversions . My diversions ? Why not one of your diversions ? I don 't do diversions . Don 't do diversions . All right , look . Go to plan B. Plan B ? What 's plan B ? We make it up as we go along . Come on . ( SIGHS ) ( EXCLAIMS ) ( CROWBAR CLATTERS ) What the ... Nice of you to drop in . I wouldn 't have missed this for the world . ( GUN COCKING ) Very touching reunion . Welcome to Stavograd . Gentlemen . Damn ! Not spying ? Then tell me , my dear Alexandria , what is this man doing here ? I was on a fishing expedition and I got lost . Catch anything ? A cold . Can 't you see they are trying to help ? If you send those jets in there , we may as well be dead . She 's right . At least with Airwolf , we 'd be able to get close enough to get a decent shot . You speak of missiles or your cameras ? Find the other one and bring him here . We have to move quickly . What 's happened ? I 've helped your friends escape . You and I will have to get out on our own . Now come . If we do not go now , there will be 1,000 more . You will come with me . Go ahead , I will bring the girl . Our orders are to bring you both . I see . Well , in that case ... Always full of surprises , Jo Santini . It 's the least I could do . Come on . Listen to me ! Look , you can 't do it . It 's too risky . It 'll be like threading a needle at 800 miles an hour . What are you , nuts ? Even in your air force , orders must be obeyed . We must go . Okay . Okay , you might have a chance at it , but I 'm not so sure about your buddy here , and I don 't think you are either . There is no choice . Yeah . Yeah , there is . Let me do it . This is not possible . Sure it is . You stay here , and I 'll go up . By the time Kirov and his goons find out , we 'll be history . This is very good idea . How do we do this ? Boris will be thrown to the wolves for such a thing . Not if I overpower him . Can you pretend to be unconscious ? They will never believe . Go on , give it a shot . It must be real . He is right . All right , have it your way . We go . ( SOLDIERS CHATTERING ) Something must have gone wrong . Now what do we do ? You can fly this Airwolf ? Yeah , I can fly this Airwolf . Halt ! No one is allowed in here . The girl is willing to cooperate . But I am not taking any chances . It could be a booby trap . Have your men take it outside . Immediately . Open the door . Hurry it up ! ( BEEPING ) I do not want excuses . Find them . Lose something ? It does not matter . There is nowhere to run . My pilots will show you just how much of your help we need . Let 's hope not , hot rod . MIKE : These things must be built for speed , 'cause they sure ain 't built for comfort . You Americans like everything too soft . You are spoiled . It 's fine by me . What say we get this over with ? Who takes the first shot ? Patch me into the aircraft through the tower . Good luck up there . We are depending on you . Well , thank you , Comrade , we 're going to need all the help we can get . What is this man doing there ? Bring them back ! Bring them back ! What is it ? The pressure in reactor number two has reached almost the critical stage again . Bring them back ! It is too late . Hold on , we 're going up . Where to ? The reactor . More pictures , then we broadcast the situation . It cannot be kept secret any longer . Uri , how did you let this happen ? Answer me ! Repeat , how did you let this happen ? MIKE : It 's a long story . Maintaining radio silence . Here goes nothing . There it is . What are those fighters doing there ? My God . That fool . JO : Transmitting pictures to control room . Come on , Mike , get the hell out of there . Commander Kirov ! What is it ? The American woman . She and Arkov have taken the Airwolf . Get out ! My God . It 's going to blow up . Send them back . Please ! Send them back . Abort the mission and return to base . Do you read me ? Abort the mission and return to base . ( STAMMERING ) Return to base . It 's too low . Is it Mike ? The second reactor 's about to blow . Hang on . Oh , my God , he 's going to crash ! Respond , damn you , respond ! Come in , Stavograd . Aircraft down . I repeat , aircraft down . Shoot her down ! Sorry , I can 't help you there . I hope you 're satisfied now , Kirov . You just killed one of the best damn pilots I 've ever seen . I 'm bringing this turkey down . Right behind you , Mike . ( INDISTINCT ) I will see you shot for this , Arkov . I think not ! Not after I discuss your brilliant plan with Moscow . I had Dimitrievich 's full authority ... You had nothing but your power-hungry ego to feed . Shall I call Dimitrievich and ask him if you authorized this insanity ? I thought as much . Now we are doing things my way . ALEXANDRIA : The explosion in the second reactor wasn 't big enough to damage the core . And the third reactor seems intact . We were very lucky . Yeah , well , we had some coming . We 'll fire directly at the walls and try and collapse them . That might smother the fire in number one . Then , if we can seal off the second reactor , we can bring the cooling system from number three and keep number two from overheating again . And your Airwolf can do this ? Let 's find out . Let 's go , Mike . Don 't blame yourself . Uri wouldn 't . Sure you don 't want me in the back seat ? No . We 're going to need a level head down here . Good luck . You better go . We have a team ready to move in the moment you have secured the situation . Good work . So much pain . So much destruction . You will be very careful up there ? You can count on it . Reactor number two ... The temperature is rising 30 Celsius degrees per minute . Switching targeting monitor to infrared . Roger . What is he doing ? They have to fire from a nosedive . It 's only way to ensure a direct hit . Ready ? And waiting . Firing one . Direct hit on number one ! ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) They haven 't sealed it off yet . Number two is still heating up . One more time . We missed . Get that team standing by . We 're switching to plan B. What 's plan B ? I 'm not sure yet . Pull back ! The whole thing 's ready to blow . What are they doing ? SAINT JOHN : Fighting fire with fire power . We 're going to laser that sucker shut . Just say the word . Fry it ! Temperature 's still rising . 900 degrees Celsius . That 's impossible ! External temperature 's reaching a critical stage . Almost . Temperature is dropping ! It 's working ! You did it , guys ! Glad to hear it . We 'll be back in as soon as we cool off . ( SIGHS ) WOMAN ON TV : Soviet authorities have released brief statement regarding the massive volumes of radioactive gases released from the Stavograd Nuclear Facility . ( REPORTER SPEAKING MANDARIN ) MAN ON TV : The Soviet News Agency went on to say that the situation in Stavograd was brought under control before it reached a critical stage . There were no deaths and only minor injuries reported . Goodbye , my friend . Goodbye . Good luck . You folks have a lot of work to do now . I just wish there was more that we could do to help . You saved my life . You saved all of our lives . What more could anyone do ? So , this time , I am in your debt . Well , let 's just say we 're even , Arkov . Nikolai is my name . I would like if there was time for us to be friends , away from the danger and the politics . Maybe we 'll make some time , Nikolai . For you . Thank you . Can you send me Mickey Mouse head from Disneyland ? Mickey , Mickey ... Mickey , Mickey ... Come here ! Okay . You take care . You take care . No , you take care . No , you take care . Go on . Get out of here . Thank you . You fly your Airwolf very carefully , my friend . We better hit the road .

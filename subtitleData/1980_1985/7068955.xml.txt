 Colonel Vidor , we have met the enemy . And they are us . If anybody knows where Sin Jin is , he does . I know he was your friend before , but he 's gone bad . Bo-Dai to group . Daddy 's in the groove . You wanna know the truth , Hawke , the crazy , rotten truth ? I know where Sin Jin is ! This briefing is from File A56-7W , classified : Top Secret . Subject : Airwolf A Mach 1-plus attack helicopter with the most advanced weapons system in the air today . It has been hidden somewhere in the western United States by its test pilot , Stringfellow Hawke . Hawke has promised to return Airwolf only if we can find his brother Sin Jin , an MIA in Vietnam . We suspect that Archangel , Deputy Director of the agency that built Airwolf , is secretly helping Hawke in return for Hawke 's flying Airwolf on missions of national concern . Stringfellow Hawke is 34 , a brilliant combat pilot and a recluse since his brother 's disappearance . His only friend is Dominic Santini , whose air service is the cover for their government work . With Hawke and Santini flying as a team at speeds rivaling the fastest jets , backed by unmatched firepower , Airwolf is too dangerous to be left in unenlightened hands . Finding it is your 1st priority . Attention . Attention . Border violation , Section 6 . Intruder aircraft . Contact , 030 degrees , northeast . 8 miles and closing . Condition red . Repeat , condition red . This is Bo-Dai . Set up the gauntlet , kids . Daddy will be right back with our guests . And bad luck to us all . Chopper at 2 o 'clock ! Bo-Dai to group . I 'm in the groove and slamming the door . Raise the gauntlet . 5 choppers , straight ahead . The sucker is still coming in . Ready to fire in sequence , my mark . No , no , cease fire ! This jockey 's got guts . He 's mine . Stay out of this , kids . All of you . Aerial combat , Reed . Not high-tech slaughter . I 'm hit ! Come on , kid , get out . Bailing out . Come on ! Yeah . Steadman , Delaney , get down there and make sure he 's okay . Bring him back to the base , We 'll wine and dine him tonight . He can play POW tomorrow . Okay , Reed , take over . Yesterday , Seko Logana 's North Limbawe Air Force attempted to knock out the South 's new missile sites . They 're a couple of antique Corsairs . The one shortage the North doesn 't have is guts . But they 'll need more than guts to eliminate those missiles . Inter-range ballistic . They 're not in place yet , but very soon . How close to ready are those silos ? 72 hours . Our reports indicate that once they are operational , South Limbawe will use them to attack the North . And we can 't let that happen . General Ali Butami . Soviet-trained and educated . The real power behind South Limbawe 's President . Harold Ngomo . He 's your basic figurehead statesman , but very popular with the people . Former history professor . A nice guy with a Hitler calling the shots . Seko Logana , North Limbawe 's President , and his wife , Lea . He 's been in contact with ... To tell you the truth , honey , politics and crisis are beginning to bore the hell out of me . Yeah , Dominic 's right . You 're just setting us up for the big pitch . Sure . The good guys in the North are on the side of apple pie and baseball , and the bad guys in the South ... Are sipping vodka , waiting to push all the wrong buttons . I haven 't asked you to do anything . Don 't bother , ' cause the answer is no . I haven 't asked because I didn 't think it would be necessary once you saw this photograph . Taken last week . The Commanding Officer of General Butami 's mercenary Helicopter Corps . That 's Colonel Vidor . Marty Vidor . Colonel Martin James Vidor , to be precise . Your Commanding Officer in Southeast Asia . He calls himself Bo-Dai-Thung nowadays . Thought he was dead for sure . He went down in some heavy ground fire ... Yes , he did . In the same operation as my brother . If anybody knows where Sin Jin is , he does . There 's not enough to go around , Delaney . And I outrank you . There ain 't no rank in this outfit , Reed . Yeah ? Well , I 'm pulling rank . Come on ! Nice flying yesterday . Lighten up , Reed . It 's a party . That goes for you too , sucker . Okay , you 're right . I am drunk . Shot to hell , but not a drop of blood showing . That 's not bad , Mamma ? Right . Right . Maybe I should write my memoirs , Mamma ? What do you think ? The Nine Lives of Marty Vidor , Professional soldier , leader of men , killer of brave , brave kids . It 's high-tech slaughter . I want pure aerial combat when I get aced . Me against somebody as good as ... as good as me . Chai ? No tea , Mamma . Whiskey . MiG , 12 o 'clock high . Got him . That 's Bo-Dai 's plane . All the better . I 'm on your 6 . Bo-Dai 's mine . Stay out of it . 1-on-1 . That 's what it 's all about . Hey , String , what 's this Bo-Dai-Thung business , the name that Vidor 's calling himself ? Bo-Dai-Thung was a North Vietnamese flyer . The Colonel shot him down . The Colonel 's chopper against his MiG . Head-on . Head-on ? Mamma mia ! Another request from West Germany . They want to establish a trade mission in the capital . What else do they want ? Agreements on imports , exports . That 's another name for oil . That makes 6 contenders . The Russians , Japanese , West Germany , the French , and now , of course , the Americans . It 's amazing how much they can love you when you have something they want . And South Limbawe wants it most of all . Speaking of which , where is this miracle worker from Archangel ? He 's late . It 's a long trip . He 'll be here . No doubt . Mercenaries are very dependable when money 's involved . Lea , I don 't like it . I don 't like it at all . Using outside forces for an African problem . It makes us no different than the South and Butami 's white killers . Yes , but I don 't like the idea of leaving your guard behind . Butami has tried to kill you twice in as many months . You must understand , my dear . Less eyes to see , and less mouths to inform . And these , of course , are machine guns , cannons . But I ask you , Mr. President , is she a beauty , or is she a beauty ? And look at those lines . Yes , Mr. Santini , it 's very aesthetic , I 'm sure . But can the aircraft do everything you say it can ? Absolutely , sir . May I ask you , sir ? How much is the Firm paying you and Mr. Hawke for helping we poor natives ? We 're here because ... Well , it 's not costing you . Isn 't it ? So , Mr. Hawke is what you would call a seat-of-the-pants flyer , Mr. Santini ? That 's right , ma 'am . I ... I guess he is . He 's also my best friend . Then , if nothing else , Mr. Hawke is a very lucky man . She may look big , Mr. President , but this lady 's actually very light on her feet , right , Dom ? Come on , give me a hand . Right this way , sir . Right here in the tail section , please . Is there something the matter , Mr. Hawke ? Yes , sir , Mr. President . Absolutely . Just stay behind the tail , please . You folks stay right here . But , Mr. Hawke , please . What are you ... Just get ready for the next demonstration . Why don 't we stand up against this tail over here ? There we go . There you are . Yeah , he 's out of range . We 'll never catch him now . He 's pretty fast on his feet . Fast on his feet ? Of course . It must be his natural rhythm . Insensitive to pain . I 'll be at Airwolf . It 's time to get out of here . Oh , Seko , you may as well have called him a racist . I thought I did . Lea , I say what I feel when I feel it . We 're here to help you , sir . You need our ... We don 't need your kind of help . You 're right . None of us need the wrong type of help . Mr. Santini , please . Now , Mr. Hawke is right . It is time for us to leave . But we 'll split up . Now , Lea , you will go with Mr. Santini . I will accompany Mr. Hawke to the location that we discussed before , where both will meet in a couple of hours . Seko , kiss me . Mr. Santini , take good care of her . She is Limbawe 's only crown jewel . Take care of yourself , Seko . I will let Mr. Hawke handle that chore . I apologized , damn it ! Yes , you did , and I accepted . Never mind accepting it ! Slow down , slow down , please ! You did say you wanted to see Airwolf do Mach 1 . Yes , I 've seen it now ! I 've seen it , I 've felt it , and I 've had enough of it ! Slow down ! Slowing down . I 'm sorry about that , Mr. President . Your apology is accepted . So , now that we have put this aircraft through its paces , I think it 's best we proceed to our destination . It would be a little embarrassing if my wife arrived there before we did , don 't you think ? For the last 3 years , General Butami , you have dominated the Office of President with your advice and your views . I must take responsibility for that . And for the fact that what President Logana has accused us of , is true . I know about the attack you 're planning . I swore an oath to protect my country . I have done nothing to betray that oath . The offensive I 've arranged is absolutely foolproof . How can war be foolproof , if it takes a fool to start one , General ? They started this war ! Years ago . There will be no war . I will call a special session of Congress ! There 's not enough time , sir . The attack will take place . You were very useful when we needed the missiles . But now , if you reveal our plan , the North will be alerted . So , I think it would be best if you remained here as our guest . Now , wait a minute , General ... Sergeant . No stomach for change , Colonel ? Where 's the officer-for-hire ? Oh , he 's still here , General . And my stomach is none of your concern . Escort Mr. Ngomo to the guest quarters . Stay with him . You almost helped him , didn 't you ? I know it 's only a small matter , General , but you could 've informed me that you were about to overthrow the government . Yes , well , I was inspired . Opportunity of the moment . Are you questioning my authority to be inspired , Colonel ? I never question anything that comes from the barrel of a gun . Or a bottle , Colonel ? The country needs us now more than ever . Don 't fail me , Vidor . Perish the thought , General . I 'm returning to the missile site . Your Helicopter Corps will be at maneuvers ? Yes , as planned . We need to get practice for the boys . Tomorrow is the big show . I 'll see you soon , Mr. President . What ? Oh , yes . By the way . Did I tell you I managed to talk our Eastern Bloc friends into testing their new nerve gas ? It 's being incorporated into the missile warheads even as we speak . Excellent idea , eh ? Yes . Excellent . And yet another button for you to push ? Very good . I like that . Yes , indeed . Indeed . This service road leads directly to the border . 10 miles on the other side is the base from which Colonel Bo-Dai and his helicopters will attack us . Unless you can stop them . Well , I 'll give it a try . I think I need a better guarantee than that . Mr. President , guarantees come with washing machines . Well yes , I understand , but I think I would feel much better if my own man was flying Airwolf . If you had one that could . Or if I had my own Airwolf . I could take it , if I wanted to . You and who else ? Perhaps them . Tell them to stop . And why should I do that ? This is a detonating device . Electronic . I press this button , Airwolf goes up . Mr. Hawke , these men are here to guard us and to protect your precious Airwolf . Your detonator ? But I 've never played mercenary . Just let that old bad side out , Dom . What bad side ? I don 't have any bad side . I mean , I 'm a nice guy . Although I do have kind of a bad temper . Vidor 's field is just ahead . But I got something else , String . A few miles south . The sonic sensors are reacting . Someone 's dropping heavy ordnance . Practice . The Colonel always believed in staying sharp . And I believe in staying alive , String . So , don 't even think , what I know you 're thinking of . Hell ! Commander to group . That was lousy , boys . Very lousy . Just one hit . All right , guys , let 's make another run . Radar says they 've got a contact . A jet , supersonic . Colonel Vidor , we have met the enemy . And they are us . Captain Hawke . Captain Hawke reporting with a little present for the Colonel . Yeah , I see it . I just don 't believe it . You 're not the type for this kind of business . And you are ? I 've been working at it . I know , that 's why I 'm here . I want a piece of the action . Okay , you got it . Colonel . It 's good to see you , Hawke . Boys , this is Captain Hawke . The second best chopper pilot in the world . Let 's get a drink . Ice . Hard to come by down here . You earn it . Sometimes . We definitely earned our perks in Nam , didn 't we ? That 's for sure . Colonel , what do you know of Sin Jin ? Wasn 't he repatriated ? Still an MIA . I thought you might know something . You went down with him . I saw his ship go down , but , then I took that SAM in the aft rotor and down I went , right into the arms of the , North Vietnamese People 's Army . I never saw Sin Jin . Remember the day we brought old Bo-Dai down ? What do you mean " we " ? You told us all to stay out of it . I was just an observer . I wish I had 50 observers like you . Old Bo-Dai-Thung could not believe anyone would go right at him like that . Least of all an imperialistic Yankee . He paid for it . Yeah , he did . I 'm glad I could go down and pick up his helmet , though . It 's a good reminder . How come you never went home ? The squadron was my home . And America had no war . Besides , I kind of liked the idea of being dead . Starting over . A new chance . I came down to Limbawe during the war . And I 've been here ever since . It pays well . What about you ? For starters , nothing paid well . What 's going on out there ? Firing squad . The former President of this embattled country . Does that bother you , Captain ? This isn 't the good old US of A , you know . North and South Limbawe are emerging countries . And birth is never an easy process . Death is always a hell of a lot easier . Well , answer my question . Does that , out there , bother you ? I came for the money . I don 't buy that for a second ! I know you , remember ! ? And I know you ! There 's still time . Time for what ? There is no time , Captain . No time at all . Now , you tell me why I should risk what I 've got here for you . I can score big . Get out of the business ... Tomorrow is not gonna be any different for either of us . It 's just a matter of who we 're doing it for and why . My faith 's restored , Colonel . I should have known you 'd see through these recruits and take action . Yeah , we all have our moments of doubt . General , why waste a perfectly good firing squad on one traitor ? Excellent idea . I won 't miss tomorrow , up there . I won 't fight you . Yeah , you will . You won 't have any choice . Now get out of here . Take Ngomo with you . Move ! Get him in that ship . Get it started . Dom , go back . Get it started . Come on , kid . Get up . Okay , Dom . I got it . You got nothing . You 're hit . I 'm okay . Don 't worry , General , your soldier-for-hire will take care of everything . Shame they got the President , though . Okay , kiddies . Nothing changes . All we gotta do is get that high-tech slick of Hawke 's , blow it out of the air , and then Butami can push his buttons . And tomorrow we all get our big , fat bonuses . All right ! I have really trained you well , haven 't I , Reed ? All of you . I may have been ignorant of the intricacies of political power , but I was never dishonest . Politically , I am opposed to you . That does not mean I wish to face you with a weapon . Then perhaps I 'm dealing with a coward . It was not I , who was willing to sacrifice his wife for peace . I want no one to die . Guns do not bring peace . They bring bigger guns . Such as your monster helicopter . One machine , 2 men , against your helicopter force ? I would order them out of the country immediately , if I could be sure they 're not needed . Welcome back to the world of the living . Is the bullet still in there ? No , passed through . You 're lucky . How do you feel ? How do I look ? Like you 've been shot , lost a lot of blood , and have a raging fever . That 's just what I feel like . ... people I represent are not . They would never accept you ... What 's going on in there ? Politics . It was quite a shock when President Ngomo stepped out of Airwolf . For the first time since I 've known him , Seko was at a loss for words . We have too many differences . Sounds like he got his words back . With a vengeance . He 's a great leader . Maybe so . How is he in the human being department ? I 'll tell him you 've regained consciousness and the use of your tongue . I 'm sorry . I 'm feeling better . That 's what Seko would say . And neither one of you are good liars . Did my husband apologize to you ? Yes . You see ? He 's a leader and a human being . Wanna give me a hand ? I really do feel better . Well , laughter 's supposed to do that , you know . And tears ? Yes . Laughter and tears both . You and I should live a long time , Mr. Hawke . - It hurts . - What ? I can 't laugh . Glad to see you up and about , Hawke . President Ngomo has agreed to form a coalition government with me . But we need your help . Lea , if you don 't mind . Of course not , Seko . Seko , it 's wonderful . For the first time , this country could really be united . My dear , there 's the slight matter of a war that must be stopped . Sir . Seko , how long have you been standing there ? A little too long , I 'm afraid . But something very interesting happened . What 's that ? I saw my wife with another man . A white man . But instead of getting angry , I put myself inside both your skins . And I knew then that as you , Hawke , I was too much of a man to betray a friend . And as you , my dearest love , I knew that I love Seko too much . How 's that for ego ? Now , now , now . Now , now . Remember , we must be heroes , and stop this war . How you feeling ? I 'll live . That 's debatable . We 've got to get those missiles . Now . And Vidor ? What 're you going to do about the Colonel ? String . I know he was your friend before , but he 's gone bad . All these years doing these kind of things ... That ... He 's sick inside . I 've seen them like that before , their guts twisted like ... like barbed wire . Everyday it twists a little tighter , and tighter . That 's his gunship . Hand-tossed mortars . It 's an old Nam trick . Lea ! I 'm hit . Seko . It 's all right . It 'll be all right . It 'll be all right , Lea . Quick , Lieutenant , a doctor ! Get a doctor ! We 're across the demarcation line . He 's still ahead of us . Pretty as you please . Playing . He wants us to catch up with him . And then he 'll play his wild card . I know . Well ? Well what ? Nothing . 3,000 meters and closing . Low hills . Nothing else on the scope yet . 10 seconds from gauntlet . And here comes another sucker . No , Reed , I 'm the sucker . And so are you . Bo-Dai to group . Daddy 's in the groove . Stand by . He 's just about past those hills , picking up speed . Ambush time . No doubt about it . Raise the gauntlet , kids , and aim straight . Daddy 's slamming the door . General Butami . Butami here . This is where you get your money 's worth , sweetheart . With interest . There they are . I have a visual . So much for the button-pushers , Hawke ? Try to set her down , Colonel . Nah , it 's no use . It 's gone on too long anyway . Games . All games . Playing soldier of fortune . Playing you . It 's crazy . You wanna know the truth , Hawke , the crazy , rotten truth ? I know where Sin Jin is ! Vidor was insane , damn it ! The man didn 't know anything about Sin Jin . What 's your evidence ? Me . You ? Yes . I 'd rather believe I led you into all this knowing Vidor had no information than to think that we might have lost a clue that would finally and irrevocably get you off my back . See you . I almost forgot . I came here to give you your unofficial report on Limbawe . Just what we need . The coalition government is still holding very well . Especially since the death of Butami . Seko and Ngomo are even friends , in a manner of speaking . And Mrs. Logana ? She 's ... fine . A national heroine . She sends her love . And this . Well , here 's to Mrs. Lea Logana , all those who survived , and those who didn 't .

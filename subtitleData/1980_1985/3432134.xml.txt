 Transcript , Synchro : Yellow Sub Thanks to : FRM Team Rome - Season 02 Episode 05 " Heroes Of the Republic " Hi boys . Let 's eat , huh ? Be there soon . I 've been thinking . If you don 't want to , you don 't need to go back to the collegium . Antony 's orders don 't stand now do they ? The orders haven 't been rescinded . There 's no there but thieves and cut throats . This is no life for children . Then where ? Where can they find respect and dignity now ? Where can they live without contempt , uh ? Take them anyplace but here . Go far away . Who 's to know ? Lying ? Live dishonestly ? Well , there 's lies and there 's lies , isn 't there ? What 's this , then ? By whose authority do you block the road ? By authority of Gaius Octavian Ceasar . Go hold your horse we 'll get to you . Sister . Not yet . We can 't run off without any money . Octavian brought his army to Rome . Put up camp yesterday , on the field of Mars . Fifteen thousand men . Your boy is a bit agressive isn 't he ? My boy gave your man a whipping . I expect he knows what he 's doing . My dear boy , You are a hero of the Republic . Ceasar himself Could not have conjured a finer victory . I am Ceasar himself . Technically speaking . Indeed . On behalf of the Senate , We are- - Deeply thankful . Not quite thankful enough to give me the triumph I ask for . Ha now there I 'm doing you a favour . Mutina was a lovely victory it 's true . But it was a victory over other romans . And with all respect . Hirtius and Panza ... Hirtius and Panza are dead . May the gods feed them honey . They 're dead . That is well known , That actual command of the battle Was in their hands . The purpose of a battle is to remain alive . They did not . I did . Indeed- - Even so- - The victory is not quite complete . Marc Antony still lived . And he still has men We 've had to send Marcus Lepidus and two legions North . Lepidus . Sending your very best then . I have every confidence that Lepidus will succeed . Then he may have a triumph too if he wants one . The people Would not look kindly on a triumph Not with your army at the walls of the city . A little unsavoury perhaps . Now there , there he has a point . How good of you to say so . I bend to your wise counselling . No triumph . I wish we 'd still find some fitting way To celebrate your glory . Perhaps , the temple to Caesar Victorious , that sounds rather fine doesn 't it . If I cannot have a triumph I was rather thinking of taking the Consul 's chair . You wish to be Consul . It 's a vanity I know But I think I deserve it . And it would please my men . You 're 19 . You 're too young to be Senator . Leave alone Consul , my dear boy . You 've been listening to bad advice , you have no experience , You have no connections . He has an army . Well ... I 'll speak with the other Senators , We 'll see if it 's possible . Though if you were to be Consul ... you must promise to be guided by my council . It is an office of high complexity . And I am well aware of my inexperience . I will not utter a word without your advice , your ... consent . Well ... perhaps something can be done . Bumptious young fool ... the Consul 's chair indeed . Yes but you will give it to him . Oh why not suit his vanity he can do no harm . He will wear the purple as he wears arms , like a ... child playing grown-Ups . Come , Tyro . I 'm leaving now . Are you sure you won 't come with me ? I 'm busy . Mother . He will come to me . Make the first gesture , And you will have the moral highground . I gave birth to the ingrate , He will come to me ! You 're delusional he 's not coming . Thank you daughter , I really appreciate these little chats We 're having between your drug binges . I 'll be going then . Should I give him your love ? What shall I tell him ? Tell him that he 's still got all our money and we want it back . Not the blue . Does it come in linen ? Blow on it , for luck . These are my daughters redeemed from slavery . The eldest has been prostituted , The boy is my wife 's child By another man . You will treat them with respect And kindness . Or I will know the reason why . It gets a good breeze from the river . We 'll have it swept , And painted . You like it ? Yes father . We 're all of us , standing again together . There 'll be ... awkardness at first , no doubt But we 're a family and we 'll be together . As it should be . And we won 't speak of the past . Yes father . Still eating like a horse I see . I dunno how you stay so skinny . How dare you ? I 'm not skinny ! I 'm slender , maybe . You 're skinny . I wonder how you don 't blow away . My armour holds me down . Mother sends her love . - Does she ? - Hmm , she does . And she would have come with me ... she has the silly idea that you should come to her . She 'll grow old alone then . I know how you feel but ... really and truly ... what would it hurt to let her have her way ? She 's your mother . Octavia you were there . You know what kind of a mother she is . Gods know I have reason to hate her as much as you do More , maybe . But where does that lead you ? Who can you love if not your own mother ? She put her lover to beating me . You credit her with too much power . Antony has a hold on her . She 's scared and lonely without him . She made a mistake . I shoud have thought that you at least would be on my side . Brother ? Please ! Don 't be like that there are no sides ! I love you ! She loves you ! You can 't turn your back on family ! She put her lover to beating me ! Her sweat was on him . So they had made love , so ? They are lovers ! Don 't be so damn pious ! You 've just thrown the family into ruinous debt ! For this ! So you can play soldiers ? ! I might have beat you myself ! Clearly there 's no point in further discussion then . Please ! Don 't be angry . Come home ! Come home . I don 't intend to enter the city until the Senate has ratified me as Consul . I shall then live at Caesar 's villa . If mother wishes to visit me there , no one will stop her . Consul ? Why would you invite such trouble ? I don 't expect you to concern yourself with such matters . But in public you will speak of me only with the utmost respect . Is that clear ? I would never say anything against you ! You 're my bother ! Thank you for visiting , sister . We 'll see each other again soon . When I 'm less busy . What a stupid arse you 've become ! Now we 've been hard pressed since you left . Shields up , leathers braced . Now we 've done well to hold our ground . I hope I 've done right by you . You 've done well I have no doubt . Thank you . We 've going as before . Pullo is second , you 're third Third ? Whatever you say , chief . But I was thinking I 'd be second . Not now woman ! Can 't you see we 're talking business ? Anything else you 'd like ? See if the children want anything ? Will do boss . Being captain , All these long months , It 's only justice isn 't it ? If it 's justice you 're after , brother , you 're in the wrong place . Pullo is second , you 're third . When I die , Pullo dies , You move up , and so it works . I bet you 50 golden drachmae It 's not me that goes first . Lucius Vorenus . Where is your head , Lyde , I 'm homeless enough . You 're a templar now . The altar of blessed Orbona . Good . And you 're well ? I am . Children ? Are they all right ? They 're well enough . Listen . Don 't think you can take them away . They 're staying with me . Lyde ! Oh , my loves , my loves , my loves . Praise the great goddess you all returned . Oh blessed Orbona , I will fulfill my vow . Praise our Goodness . Praise our Goodness . Praise our Goodness . Come to bed love . What 's wrong princess ? Why you 're crying ? Tell me . Something I 've done , I expect . Why do you leave me with these bad people ? They treated you alright , didn 't they ? Name the one that didn 't treat you right And I 'll see to it . Why do you leave me here for Vorenus ? He needed my help . I couldnt let it lie to children . Vorenus , him you love . Me ? No . No ! You , yes . He more . No . No question . If both of you would drown in the river , I 'd save you first . No question . Swear . I swear . You 're half his weight . Half ? Half his weight . Not so heavy , easy to say . Nevermind . Mother . It 's so good to see you . I ... My son . My son . Forgive me . Forgive me . I 've been wicked and cruel but ... beat me , kill me , do what you want , but just please ... Please forgive me . Mother , please ... I spit on that pig Antony for leading me astray . I 've been a terrible mother But I can change and I will change if you just give me a chance I need time only son God 's be my witness . I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry . I forgive you . Thank you . Thank you . Look who 's here , daughter . Our beloved Octavian has blessed us with his forgiveness . Welcome home brother . Father Janus , I ask you to cleanse these children of the dark spirits that have fouled them . Thank you for bringing my family back to me . I swear to you that from this day I renounce darkness , and I will walk in the path of light . Right , left , right ! Lapidus . My old friend . How are you ? I 've seen better days . Off you go boys I don 't think general Lapidus has any ill designs on me . Do you ? Not under present circumstances . Come on . My men deserted to your side with amazing alacrity . Not a single blow struck yet , my camp is empty . Amazing . Yes , I really must write to Cicero and the Senate . It 's been remarkably generous of them to give me So many fresh troups . I confess I had no idea how popular you are with a ranking fire Soldiers like a little spit and dirt in their leaders You are too noble for them , perhaps , Too aristocratic . I may be so . So , what to do now ? As strictly speaking , of course , I should kill you . I really don 't wish to be punitive But on the other hand , I can 't really let you go either . What to do ? To do Oh well , Would you be willing to act as my second in command ? Dear me . That 's very generous of you . I ... Yes or no . Well , I , I can 't really say no . Can I ? No . You can 't . I swear to you , four nipples How is married life , Pullo ? Well enough . Women , he ! It 's a strange awkward arrangement to be thrust up and Bound against another so . But it seems to be the natural state of man and woman - Must be right and good . - No doubt . Listen to me . Learn lecturing and lying . Any plans to wed , then ? I 'm thinking about it . So Vorenus and his family are back in Rome . Yes . My friend asks you to understand That he remains on the loyal oath to the man of North . But he will do what 's best for the City . He acknowledges That you 're legal custodian of the Republic And will keep the peace the same as before . Then tell your friend I 'm grateful But I hear there is a deal of violence again between the Collegia . No trouble . We may need to buy a few heads together . Maybe . Whatever needs to be done , A period of calm is essential . We understand but ... my friend won 't answer for the future If him up north were to come back with full armor on ... We should hope for the best Well done by the way . All this . Thank you Pullo . What an auspicious day . Many gave their lives that we might stand here Once again united in the government of our lawful Republic . And how fitting that we welcome this new beginning By swearing in the youngest Consul In the history of Rome . Gaius Octavian Caesar . Esteemed Senators . I take this first moment before you not to glorify myself But to honour my father . In his honour , I declare that my term as Consul Shall assure a new era . An era Of moral virtue . Of dignity . The debauchery and chaos we have had to endure will now end . Rome , Shall be again as she once was . A proud Republic of virtuous women And honest men . I speak to you now , Not as a soldier , Or a citizen . But as a grieving son . As my first act in this reborn Republic And in honor of my father , I propose To declare Brutus and Cassius Murderers And enemies of the state . My dear boy this is not what we agreed . It is not . Nevertheless here we are . Brutus and Cassius still have many friends . You will split the Chamber , the unity of the Republic . Step away from my chair . My father died on this floor . Right there . Stabbed 27 times , butchered By men he called his friends . Who will tell me that is not murder ? Who will tell my legions Who loved Caesar as I do That that is not murder ? Who will speak against the motion ? Some willow tea , perhaps ? Henbane , more like . I 've been outmaneuvred By a child . To the country , then . Some fresh air and sleep will do you good . Take a letter . To Marcus Junius Brutus And Gaius Cassius Legianus . Dominus , If Octavian hears that You are in communication with Brutus Don 't talk . Write . Heroes of the Republic , Greetings . Children . Father . Are you all well ? We are . Broken , is it ? No problem . No trouble . I 'll fix it . Yeah , easy mend . I 've been very busy since we 've been back , We haven 't spent enough time together . I thought maybe sometime soon we could Spend a day together . In the country . Would you like that ? If you 'd like . Good . Good . Yeah , we 'll do that . We 'll do that . Want anything from the kitchen before I lock up ? No . It 's good to have you back . Ever seen a real one ? - What 's that ? - An elephant . Yes . You ? Are they as big as they say ? They 're big . No wheels though . No . No wheels . You can have me if you 'd like . Or I can go . Stay . You can go now . - Go ? - Yeah . There are some coins on the table . Take half . Fuck you . You haven 't seen how much is there yet . I 'm not a whore . No ? Then why are you here ? I though you liked me . You like me too I suppose . Something like that . Oh , what a happy couple we 'd make . Take the money . Fuck you . I told you , I 'm not a whore . Hey ! Take the money . Maecenus , I 'm going . What ? I 'm going ! Already ? I 'm tired . No , no no , stay ! It gets som much better . We are 2nd to the Consul now We should not be in such places . Don 't be so fucking pious , What 's the point of being 2nd to the Consul If we can 't have some fun ? What ? Nevermind , go if you like . I can 't hear you . Go if you like . I 'm going . I say ... are the walls melting ? I don 't think so . They are , you know ? They are mounting . We should all die . Octavia ? Have her washed and put to bed as quietly as possible . Wait ! Good evening , Madam . You 'll excus me if I hurry away . Exactly what are you doing with my daughter in the middle of the night ? He abducted me . Oh ? I wa sat ... a perfectly nice party with Jocasta , And this impudent brute Abducted me . And brought you home to mother ? This is a strange abduction . Where was she ? Octavia , you had best tell her the truth . Where were you ? I was at an orgy , Mother . - It was an orgy . - Early stages . Early stages of an orgy . The bucket ritual had not yet begun . You stupid drunken slut ! Realyy , there 's no need for ... It 's that bitch Jocasta 's fault ! She 's the one that led you astray ! So , I was at an orgy , who cares ? What do you think your brother 'll do if he finds out ? I pull a hair for what my brother will do . Oh , really ? Whilst he 's at the forum preaching piety and virtue to the plebs , You 're sucking slave cock at an orgy ! How do you think that looks ? He 'll banish you at the very least . No , he won 't . And I suck no slave cock . Haven 't got to that part ... Banished ! Gone ! And me with you , to some filthy greek island ! Don 't you dare say a word to anyone about this ! Never ! Of course ! What do you mean " of course " ? Why wouldn 't you run and tell your lord and master ? Because , I wouldn 't . Why not ? Tell me . Because ... Because I love her . You only say that , Because you don 't know me . No . No I know you very well . You are kind , And full hearted , and And beautiful . And ... And I would tear down the sky if you asked me to . If you ever speak again to her like that in my presence , I shall ... I shall be very angry . Brother , what 's afoot ? Letter from Cicero . The boy Octavian has forced the Senate to declare us Murderers and enemies of the Republic . It 's an outrage , that 's a crime ! No , it 's a terrible blunder . Octavian was said fair until now With the Senate and people behind him . Now , now The Seante fears they have created another tyrant . Cicero begs us to return as soon as we can , begs us ! To save the Republic . Scribe ! So Octavian has only the four legions , no ? Antony , seven . That 's a beauty of it . Antony and Octavian hate each other far more than they hate us . Soon enough they must fight each other for supremacy . We need only wait , Mop up the survivors . Scribe ! This , this Is what we 've been waiting for , there you are . Take a letter . To Cicero . - Bacchus . - Bacchus ! So , you 're back . Found your children he ? - I did . - They were slaves , I hear . They were . I 'm hapy for you . Nothing more importan than family . That 's true , that 's why I came to see you . I don 't want my children to live in fear , I want us to make peace . - Peace ? - The new Consul demands it . You haven 't spoke to him , did you ? He and Pullo are old friends . What do you mean , " bah " ? It 's allright , brother . Cotta here means no offense , do you , cotta ? All this bloodshed it 's bad for business and bad for the city . Bloodshed started by you . I won 't deny it , I was Angry , but Now I 'm calm . I can see clear , I can see that we all have suffered enough . You , Memmio , how many you lost ? A few . You Cotta , how many ? Not as many as you . All good men , wives and children gone , and for what ? All we 've given is strength to our enemies . With peace amongst us 3 , The Serbo and the Lower Collegium will have to Kiss our feet , as they once did . What terms do you suggest ? Your two collegia will have the argosy docks . You can divide them between you as you wish . We keep the Ostians . The Ostians want to come with us . Nevertheless , they stay with the Aventine . But you can have a taste , at say , 5 % . Each . If that 'll make you happy . Peace then . They 'll think we 've gone soft . Let them , we need time to regain our strength . While they 're fighting of the spoils of the argosy , We will be recruiting men , And restoring order . He 's gone soft . Maybe , maybe not , we 'll see . M We 'll split half and half , eh ? Bullocks we will . Careful ! Come on , you can do it . Aiuto ! Oh , the children ! Children , what are you doing here ? We 've run away ! Run away ? Why ? We can 't stay with that evil man . - Children , come along . - He is your father . He killed mama ! He cast us to slavery and disgrace ! I understand it 's a hard thing to bear , but it is As it must be . - I hate him ! And for hatred , You lead your borther and sister unprotected into the street . I will take care of them , we 've got enough money . The first thief that crosses your path will have that , and then what ? You 're alone in the world , how will you live ? By stealing ? By whoring ? If I have to . And your sister ? When she turns woman , shall she be a whore also ? Your brother a catomite ? Where will you run ? Vorenus will not find you . You 're all he has left . He 'll not rest until he has you back . You must stay with your father . And while you live under his roof , You may carry your hatred Like a stone inside you . But you mustn 't ever let him see it . Ever . You must be an obedient daughter . Kneel to him . - Tell him you love him . - Never ! Your mother wants you to live ! Believe me ! This your only chance . Their only chance . It 's what your mother would have wanted . He will know I 'm lying . Your love And forgiveness Is all he wants . He will thank the Gods for redeeming him . Would you care for a glass of wine ? Thank you , no , this is not a social call . I will not prevaricate . As leader of the Seante I must ask Rather , I must formally demand That you surrender command of your legions . You are speaking to a Consul of Rome . Give up my army ? And why would I do that ? The Senate feels that you have used your legions in a Coercive manner against them , They 're inclined to resent it . I 'm sorry they feel so . But with all respect , their resentment Has no teeth . What will happen if I do not do as they say ? Perhaps they will throw their sandals at you . Word came from the east . Brutus and Cassius are returning to us . They bring with them Legions . How many legions do you have ? Four , is it ? I have no notions of their intentions of course , But I suspect they 're displeased To be name murderers and enemies of the State . They were named so because they are so . Be that as it may , If you were to disarm yourself I might persuade Brutus to treat you leniently . On account of your Youth And inexperience . Let us not contemplate the alternative . A war between you and Brutus would be short And bloody . And not to your advantage . 20 legions , eh ? He exagerates the number I expect . Half of that number would be enough to crush the men we have . It will be some months before they arrive . We couls raise more legions in the meantime . Fresh men . Untrained they would only be more mouths to feed . Sir ? - What 's to be done then ? - I don 't know ? I don 't know . Hello boys . Why the glum , did someone die ? Brutus , My dear son . I hear today that you are returning to us . I give thanks to the Gods And pray for your success . I enclose your father 's ring That his father gave him . He always used to say It was made of gols from the crown from the last king . Your father liked the good story , So I don 't know if that 's true , But it is nice to think so . I hand it on to you With all love and respect . We 'll wait until the roads are dry , And then march south through arretium and on to Rome . That is clearly The best plan of action . You object , Lepidus ? Not at all . Sounds eminently feasible . A touch agressive perhaps . General Antony , Sir . I 'm not sure about the beard . How on earth did you manage to get here ? All alone ? Oh I 'm not alone . A cow can 't have three bulls . I hear , it 's not funny ! Smells delicious . Thank you father , I hope you like it . - Family , huh ? - Family !

And I have been , and always shall be , your friend . Live long and prosper . We are assembled here today to pay final respects to our honoured dead . This death takes place in the shadow of new life , the sunrise of a new world , a world that our beloved comrade gave his life to protect and nourish . He did not feel this sacrifice a vain or empty one . Of my friend , I can only say this . Of all the souls I have encountered in my travels , his was the most human . Honours . Space , the final frontier . These are the continuing voyages ofthe Starship Enterprise . Her ongoing mission , to explore strange new worlds , to seek out new life forms and new civilisations , to boldly go where no man has gone before . U.S.S. Enterprise , Captain 's personal log . With most of our battle damage repaired , we 're almost home , yet I feel uneasy , and I wonder why . Perhaps it is the emptiness of this vessel . Most of our trainee crew have been reassigned . Lieutenant Saavik and my son David are exploring the Genesis planet , which he helped create , and Enterprise feels like a house with all the children gone . No . More empty even than that . The death of Spock is like an open wound . It seems that I have left the noblest part of myself back there on that newborn planet . Status , Mr Sulu . On course , Admiral . Estimating spacedock in 2.1 hours . Very well . Mr Chekov , I 'll need a pre-approach scan . Take the science station , please . - Yes , sir . - Uhura . Any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries ? No , sir . There is no response . That 's very odd . Scotty , progress report . It 's almost done , sir . You 'll be fully automated by the time we dock . Your timing is excellent , Mr Scott . You fixed the barn door after the horse has come home . How much refit time till we can take her out again ? Eight weeks , sir , but you don 't have eight weeks , so I 'll do it for you in two . Mr Scott , have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four ? Certainly , sir . How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle-worker ? Your reputation is secure , Scotty . Mr Sulu , take the conn . I 'll be in my quarters . Aye , sir . Sir ? I was wondering , are they planning a ceremony when we get in ? I mean a reception ? A hero 's welcome , son , is that what you 'd like ? Well , God knows there should be . This time we 've paid for the party with our dearest blood . Steady . Steady , boys . Keep scanning . I thought you people were reliable . Where the hell is he ? He 's been here for some time . Put me on hailing frequency . Commander Kruge , this is Valkris . I have purchased the Genesis data . Ready to transmit . Well done , Valkris . Well done . What the hell is ... Disengage cloaking device ! Transmit data . Now ! Transmission completed . You will find it useful . Then you have seen it ? I have , my lord . Unfortunate . Understood . Thrusters . What the hell 's going on ? When do I get paid off ? Soon , Captain . Quite soon . Success my lord . and my love . You will be remembered with honour . Fire ! New course , Federation neutral zone . Feed him ! Yes , my lord . Approach control , this is Enterprise . Ready for docking manoeuvre . Enterprise is cleared to dock . Lock on . Systems locked . Spacedock , you have control . Affirmative , Enterprise . Enjoy the ride , and welcome home . Enterprise confirms . Moving in . Acknowledged . Doors closing . Would you look at that . My friends , the great experiment , the Excelsior , ready for trial runs . She 's supposed to have transwarp drive . Aye , and if my grandmother had wheels , she 'd be a wagon . Come , come , Mr Scott . Young minds , fresh ideas . Be tolerant . - Acknowledged . Doors are closing . - Updating . Stand by umbilical and gravitational support systems . Aye , sir . Moorings activated . All systems standing by . Admiral , this is not possible . Mr Chekov ? An energy reading from C-deck , from inside Mr Spock 's quarters . I ordered Spock 's quarters sealed . Yes , sir . I sealed the room myself . Nevertheless , I am reading a life form there . This entire crew seems on the edge of obsessive behaviour concerning Mr Spock . Sir , security reports the door to Spock 's quarters has been forced . I 'm on my way . Mr Sulu , continue docking procedure . Aye , sir . Jim , help me . You left me on Genesis . Why did you do that ? Help me . Bones . What the hell are you doing ? Have you lost your mind ? Help me , Jim . Take me home . Bones , we are . We are home . Then perhaps it 's not too late . Climb the steps , Jim . Climb the steps of Mount Seleya . Mount Seleya ? Bones , Mount Seleya is on Vulcan . We 're home , on Earth . Remember . Admiral , docking is completed . Starfleet Commander Morrow is on his way for inspection . Uhura , get the medics down here ! Get them now ! You 've all done remarkable service under the most difficult conditions . You 'll be receiving Starfleet 's highest commendation , and more importantly , extended shore leave . That is , all but you , Mr Scott . They need your wisdom on the new Excelsior . Report there tomorrow as captain of engineering . With all appreciation , sir , I 'd prefer to supervise the refit of Enterprise . I 'm afraid that won 't be necessary . But , sir ... I 'm sorry , Mr Scott , but there will be no refit . Admiral , I don 't understand . - The Enterprise is not ... - Jim , the Enterprise is 20 years old . We feel her day is over . But we had requested ... We 'd hoped to take her back to Genesis . That is out of the question . May I ask why ? ln your absence , Genesis has become a galactic controversy . Until the Federation Council makes policy , you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis . Consider it a quarantined planet and a forbidden subject . To fully understand the events on which I report , it is necessary to review the theoretical data on the Genesis device , as developed by Doctors Carol and David Marcus . Genesis , simply put , is life from lifelessness . It was the intention to introduce the Genesis device into a preselected area of a lifeless space body , a moon or other dead form . The device , when delivered , would instantaneously cause the Genesis effect . Instead of a dead moon , a living , breathing planet now exists , capable of sustaining whatever life forms we see fit to deposit on it . So ? Speak . Great power to control , dominate . Speak . Impressive . They can make planets . Oh , yes . New cities , homes in the country , your woman at your side , children playing at your feet , and overhead , fluttering in the breeze , the flag of the Federation . Charming . Station . Yes , my lord . - Share this with no one . - Understood , my lord . We are going to this planet . Even as our emissaries negotiate for peace with the Federation , we will act for the preservation of our race . We will seize the secret of this weapon , the secret of ultimate power . Success , my lord . We have reached destination planet at .035 . Very well , Lieutenant . Helm , execute standard orbital approach . Standard orbit . Aye , sir . Communications , send a coded message for Starfleet Commander , priority one . Federation science vessel Grissom arriving Genesis planet , Mutara Sector to begin research . J.T. Esteban , commanding . Aye , sir . Coding now . Dr Marcus , it 's your planet . Begin scanning , please . This is where the fun begins , Saavik . Just like your father , so human . All units functional . Recorders are on . Scanning Sector 1 . Foliage in fully-developed state of growth . Temperature , 22.2 Celsius . Sector 2 indicating desert terrain . Minimal vegetation . Temperature , 39.4 . Sector 3 , subtropical vegetation . Temperature decreasing rapidly . It 's snow . Snow in the same sector . Fantastic . Fascinating . All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours ' walk . Metallic mass . Close-range scan . A photon tube . Gravitational fields were in flux . It must have soft-landed . In code to Starfleet . Captain Spock 's tube located on Genesis ' surface . Yes , sir . Coding your message . I don 't believe it . What is it ? If equipment is functioning properly , indications are an animal life form . - You said there wouldn 't be any . - There shouldn 't be any . Cross-referenced and verified . An unidentifiable life-form reading . - Do you wish to advise Starfleet , sir ? - Wait a minute . We don 't know what we 're talking about here . - Why don 't we beam it up ? - Oh , no , you don 't . Regulations specifically state , " Nothing shall be beamed aboard " until danger of contamination has been eliminated . " Captain , the logical alternative is obvious . Beaming down to the surface is permitted . If the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger . Captain , please , we 'll take the risk , but we 've got to find out what it is . Or who . Absent friends . Admiral , what 's gonna happen to the Enterprise ? - She 's to be decommissioned . - Will we get another ship ? I can 't get an answer . Starfleet is up to its brass in a galactic conference . No one has time for those who only stand and wait . Sir , about Dr McCoy , how is he ? Well , that 's the good news . He 's home , resting comfortably , pumped full of tranquilisers . They say it 's exhaustion . He promised me he 'd stay put . Well , we 'll see . Mr Scott . Come . Sarek ! Ambassador , I had no idea you were here . I believe you know my crew . I will speak with you alone , Kirk . Please excuse us . Ambassador , I would have come to Vulcan to express my deepest sympathies ... Spare me your human platitudes , Kirk . I have been to your government . I have seen the Genesis information and your own report . Then you know how bravely your son met his death . Why did you leave him on Genesis ? Spock trusted you , and you denied him his future . - I saw no future . - Only his body was in death , Kirk , and you were the last one to be with him . Yes , I was . And you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan . - But why ? - Because he asked you to . He entrusted you with his very essence , with everything that was not of the body . He asked you to bring him to us and to bring that which he gave you , his katra , his living spirit . Sir . Your son meant more to me than you can know . I 'd have given my life if it would have saved his . Believe me when I tell you , he made no request of me . He would not have spoken of it openly . - Then how ... - Kirk , I must have your thoughts . May I join your mind ? Certainly . He spoke of your friendship . Yes . He asked you not to grieve . Yes . The needs of the many outweigh ... The needs of the few . Or the one . Spock . I have been , and always shall be , your friend . Live long and prosper . No . Forgive me . It is not here . I had assumed he mind-melded with you . It is the Vulcan way when the body 's end is near . We were separate . He couldn 't touch me . I see . Then everything that he was , everything he knew , is lost . Please wait . He would have found a way . If there was that much at stake , Spock would have found a way . Yes . But how ? What if he joined with someone else ? Engine room , flight recorder visual . Stardate 8128.78 . Go . The ship . Out of danger ? Yes . Back .77 . Flight recorder visual 28.77 . Go . No ! You 'll flood the whole compartment . - He 'll die . - Kirk ! He 's dead already . Back .76 . Flight recorder visual 28.76 . Go . You 're not going in there . Perhaps you 're right . What is Mr Scott 's condition ? Well , I don 't think that he ... I 'm sorry , Doctor . I have no time to discuss this logically . Freeze . Repeat and augment . Remember . - McCoy ! - One alive , one not , yet both in pain . What must I do ? You must bring them to Mount Seleya on Vulcan . Only there can both find peace . What you ask is difficult . You will find a way , Kirk . If you honour them both , you must . I will . I swear . Transporter Room , stand by to energise . Aye , sir . Energising now . Grissom to Saavik . We 're picking up radiation from the life form . Affirmative , Captain . Our readings are well below danger level . Very well . Exercise caution , Lieutenant . This landing is Captain 's discretion , and I 'm the one who 's out on a limb . I 'll try to remember that , Captain . There are your life forms . These were microbes on the tube 's surface . We shot them here from Enterprise . They were fruitful and multiplied . But how could they have evolved so quickly ? Saavik . What is it ? Spock 's burial robe . No . Absolutely not , Jim . You 're my best officer , but I am Commander , Starfleet , so I don 't break rules . Don 't quote rules to me . I 'm talking about loyalty and sacrifice . One man who 's died for us , another with deep emotional problems . Now wait a minute . This business about Spock and McCoy , honestly , I never understood Vulcan mysticism . You don 't have to believe . I 'm not even sure that I believe , but if there 's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul , - then it 's my responsibility . - Yours ? As surely as if it were my very own . Give me back the Enterprise . With Scotty 's help I could ... No , Jim . The Enterprise would never stand the pounding , and you know it . Then I 'll find a ship . I 'll hire a ship . Out of the question , my friend . The council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis . Jim , your life and your career stand for rationality , not for intellectual chaos . Keep up this emotional behaviour and you 'll lose everything . You 'll destroy yourself . Do you understand me , Jim ? I hear you . - I had to try . - Of course . - Thanks for the drink . - Anytime . - The word , sir ? - The word is no . I am therefore going anyway . - You can count on our help , sir . - Thank you , Mr Sulu . I 'll need it . Shall I alert Dr McCoy ? Please . He has a long journey ahead of him . Long time , Doc . Yeah . Anybody been looking for me ? I have , but what 's the use ? What 'll it be ? Altair water . That 's not your usual poison . To expect one to order poison in a bar is not logical . Got it . To your planet , welcome . I think that 's my line , stranger . Forgive . I here am new , but you are known , being McCoy from Enterprise . - You have me at a disadvantage , sir . - I name not important . You seek l . Message received . Available ship stands by . - How much and how soon ? - How soon is now . How much is where . Somewhere in the Mutara Sector . Mutara restricted . Take permits many . Money more . There aren 't going to be any damn permits . How can you get a permit to do a damn illegal thing ? Look , price you name , money I got . Place you name . Money I name . Otherwise , bargain no . All right , damn it . It 's Genesis . The name of the place we 're going is Genesis ! - Genesis ? - Yes , Genesis ! How can you be deaf with ears like that ? Genesis allowed is not . ls planet forbidden ! Look , my backwards friend , Genesis may be planet forbidden , but I 'm damn well ... Sir , I 'm sorry , but your voice is carrying . I don 't think you want to be discussing this subject in public . I 'll discuss what I like , and who in the hell are you ? Could I offer you a ride home , Dr McCoy ? Where 's the logic in offering me a ride home , you idiot ? If I wanted a ride home , would I be trying to charter a space flight ? - How in the hell do you know who I am ? - Federation security , sir . You 're gonna get a nice long rest , Doctor . Saavik to Grissom . We are definitely reading a second life form . We concur . Proceed with caution , Saavik . What the hell is going on down there ? Make it quick , Admiral . They 're moving him to the Federation funny farm . Yes , poor friend . I hear he 's fruity as a nut cake . Two minutes . Jim . - How many fingers do I have up ? - That 's not very damn funny . - Your sense of humour 's returned . - The hell it has . What 's that ? - Lexorin . - Lexorin ? What for ? You 're suffering from a Vulcan mind-meld , Doctor . That green-blooded son of a bitch . It 's his revenge for all those arguments he lost . Let me see your hand . This will make you well enough to travel . Where 's Admiral Kirk ? - He 's with the prisoner . - Get him quickly . Commander , Starfleet wants him right away . Keeping you busy ? Don 't get smart , Tiny . - Admiral , Starfleet ... - This man 's sick . Here , take a look . Side elevator . Agents on their way up . Don 't call me Tiny . Unit two , this is unit one . The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land . - Acknowledge . - Message acknowledged . All units will be informed . - You 're taking me to the promised land ? - What are friends for ? - Mr Scott , calling it a night ? - Yes , sir . Turning in myself . Looking forward to breaking some of the Enterprise 's speed records tomorrow . Yes , sir . Good night . - Level , please . - Transporter Room . - Thank you . - Up your shaft . Roger . Old City Station at 2200 hours . All is well . Understood . All stations clear . - You amaze me , Commander . - How is that ? A 20-year space veteran , yet you choose the worst duty station in town . I mean , look at this place . This is the hind end of space . Peace and quiet appeals to me , Lieutenant . Yeah , well , maybe that 's okay for someone like you , whose career is winding down , but me , I need some challenge in my life , some adventure , maybe even just a surprise or two . Well , you know what they say , Lieutenant . Be careful what you wish for . You may get it . Good evening , Commander . ls everything ready ? Step into my parlour , gentlemen . That 's Admiral Kirk . My God ! Very good for you , Lieutenant . But it 's damn irregular . No destination orders , no encoded lDs . - All true . - Well , what are we gonna do about it ? I 'm not gonna do anything about it , but you 're gonna sit in the closet . The closet ? What , have you lost all your sense of reality ? This isn 't reality . This is fantasy . You wanted adventure , how 's this ? The old adrenaline going ? Good boy . Now get in the closet . Okay . Go on . Go on . I 'll just get in the closet . Okay ! - I 'm glad you 're on our side . - Can you handle that ? I 'll have " Mr. Adventure " eating out of my hand , sir , and I 'll see all of you at the rendezvous . And , Admiral , all my hopes . As promised , she 's all yours , sir . All systems automated and ready . A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her . Thank you , Mr Scott , I 'll try not to take that personally . My friends , I can 't ask you to go any further . Dr McCoy and I have to do this . The rest of you do not . Admiral , we 're losing precious time . What course , please , Admiral ? Mr Scott ? I 'd be grateful , Admiral , if you 'd give the word . Gentlemen , may the wind be at our backs . Stations , please . - Engage all the systems . - Aye , engaged ! - Clear all moorings . - Cleared , sir . One-quarter impulse power . One-quarter impulse . Sir , Commander , Starfleet on emergency channel . He orders you to surrender this vessel . - No reply , Chekov . - Aye , sir . Steady as she goes , Sulu . Yellow alert . Captain to the Bridge . Yellow alert . Bridge , this is the Captain . How can you have a yellow alert in spacedock ? Sir , someone is stealing the Enterprise . I 'm on my way . Alert . Yellow alert . All stations , yellow alert . One minute to spacedoors . Are you just gonna walk through them ? Calm yourself , Doctor . Sir , Excelsior powering up with orders to pursue . Yellow alert . - Status ? - Yellow alert . All automates ready and functioning . Automatic moorings retracted . All speeds available through transwarp drive . Incredible machine . Helm . One-quarter impulse power . Thirty seconds to spacedoors . Warning . Secure spacedoors . - Warning . Secure spacedoors . - And ... - Now , Mr Scott . - Sir ? - The doors , Mr Scott . - Aye , sir . I 'm working on it . Danger . Spacedoors are closed . Danger . Danger . Spacedoors are closed . We have cleared spacedoors . - Full impulse power . - Aye , sir . Stand by tractor beam . Tractor beam , aye . If he tries to get away with warp drive , he 's really in for a shock . Excelsiorclosing to 4,000 metres , sir . Scotty , we 'll need everything you have . Aye , sir . Warp drive standing by . Kirk . If you do this , you 'll never sit in the captain 's chair again . - Warp speed . - Aye , sir . Warp speed . Prepare for warp speed . Stand by transwarp drive . Transwarp at your command , sir . Full power available . Execute . Full power available ... Engine room reports full power available . Transwarp drive , maximum velocity in five , four , three , two , one . Scotty , as good as your word . Aye , sir . The more they overthink the plumbing , the easier it is to stop up the drain . Here , Doctor , souvenirs from one surgeon to another . I took them out of her main transwarp computer drive . Nice of you to tell me in advance . That 's what you get for missing staff meetings , Doctor . Gentlemen , your work today has been outstanding . I intend to recommend you all for promotion in whatever fleet we end up serving . Best speed to Genesis . I am Saavik ... Can you speak ? The Genesis wave . His cells could have been regenerated . Captain , this is Saavik . Come in , please . Yes , Saavik . Go ahead . We have found the life sign . It is a Vulcan child , perhaps 8 to 1 0 Earth years of age . A child ? How did he get there ? It is Dr Marcus ' opinion that this is ... That the Genesis effect has in some way regenerated Captain Spock . Saavik , that 's extraordinary . What would you like to do next ? Request permission to beam aboard immediately . Saavik , does Dr Marcus think there could be any chance of radioactive contamination ? - No . - None that he can detect , sir . All the same , I 'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions . I 'm sure Starfleet would approve , sir . Probably true , but let 's do it by the book . Stand by on this channel . Go . Starfleet Command , this is U.S.S. Grissom on subspace coded channel 98.8 . Come in , please . Sir , something is jamming our transmission , an energy surge . Locate . Surge from astern , Captain . Oh , my God . Gunner : target engine only . Captain , what is happening ? We 're under attack ! Stand by for evasive . I wanted prisoners ! A lucky shot sir ... Animal ! Sir , may I suggest ... Say the wrong thing , Torg . If it 's prisoners you want , there are life signs on the planet . Perhaps the very scientists you seek . Saavik calling Grissom . Come in , please . Very good . Grissom , this is Saavik on emergency frequency . Come in , please . Saavik , what happened to them ? It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack . We must go . They will soon come after us . Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours , present speed . - Can we hold speed , Scotty ? - Aye , she 's got her second wind now . Scan for vessels in pursuit . Scanning . lndications negative at this time . Did I get it right ? Great , Bones . Just great . It 's time for total truth between us . This planet is not what you intended or hoped for , is it ? Not exactly . Why ? I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix . Protomatter , an unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable . But it was the only way to solve certain problems . So , like your father , you changed the rules . If I hadn 't , it might have been years or never . How many have paid the price for your impatience ? How many have died ? How much damage have you done ? And what is yet to come ? Bridge , nothing happening here . This planet 's ageing in surges . And Spock with it . It seems they 're joined together . They are . - How long ? - Days , maybe hours . I 'm sorry . It will be hardest on Spock . Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood . I don 't understand . Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life . Whoever they are , they 're getting closer . - I 'll go . - No . I 'll do it . Give me your phaser . Sir , Starfleet calling U.S.S. Grissom . A warning about us . Response ? Nothing , as before . What 's the Grissom up to ? Will she join us or will she fire on us ? Chekov , break silence . Send Captain Esteban my compliments . Aye , sir . How are we doing ? It 's funny you should put it quite that way , Jim . We are doing fine , but I 'd feel safer giving him one of my kidneys than what 's scrambled in my brain . Admiral , there is no response from Grissom on any channel . Keep trying , Chekov , at regular intervals . So it has come . It is called Pon farr . Will you trust me ? We are secured from warp speed . Now entering Genesis Sector . Proceed at impulse power . - Vessel entering sector . - Yes . Federation battle cruiser . - Have they scanned us ? - Not yet . Engage cloaking device . I 'd swear there was something there , sir . What did you see ? For an instant , a scout-class vessel . Could be Grissom . Patch in a hailing frequency . Grissom , this is Enterprise calling . Please come in . Grissom , this is Enterprise calling . Do you read ? Spock ! I 've come a long way for the power of Genesis and what do I find ? A weakling human , a Vulcan boy , and a woman . My lord , we are survivors of a doomed expedition . This planet will destroy itself in hours . The Genesis experiment is a failure . A failure . The most powerful , destructive force ever created . You will tell me the secret of the Genesis torpedo . I have no knowledge . Then I hope pain is something you enjoy . I ordered no interruptions ! But , sir , Federation starship approaching . Bring me up . Grissom , this is Enterprise calling . Do you read ? Grissom , this is Enterprise calling . Please come in . Battle Alert ! Grissom . This is Enterprise . Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik . Please come in . - Report status . - We are cloaked . Enemy closing on impulse power . Range , 5,000 kellicams . Good . This is just the turn of luck I have been waiting for . Nothing on my scanner , sir . Short-range scan , Mr Chekov . Put it on visual , Mr Sulu . Range , 3,000 kellicams . Steady . Continue on impulse power . Range , 2,000 kellicams . Stand by to transfer energy to weapons . At my command . There . That distortion . See it ? Yes , sir . It 's getting larger as we close in . Firing range , sir . Gunner : Target engine only - Understood ? Understood clearly , sir . - Opinion , Mr Sulu . - I think it 's an energy surge . Enough energy to hide a ship , would you say ? A cloaking device . - Red alert , Mr Scott . - Aye , sir . 1,000 kellicams , closing . - All power to the weapons systems . - Aye , sir . No shields ? If my guess is right , they 'll have to decloak before they can fire . May all your guesses be right . Klingon bird-of-prey , sir . - She 's arming torpedoes . - Fire , Mr Scott . Good shooting , Mr Scott . - Precautionary , Mr Chekov . Shields up . - Aye , sir . Emergency power to the thrusters ! Sir , the shield 's nonresponsive . - Scotty ? - The automation system 's overloaded . I didn 't expect to take us into combat , you know . Emergency power . Prepare to return fire . Mr Scott , can you transfer power to the phaser banks ? - I don 't think so , sir . - What happened ? Well , they 've knocked out the automation centre , and I 've got no control over anything . Mr Sulu ? Nothing , sir . So , we 're a sitting duck . Ready to fire emergency tube . Why haven 't they finished us ? - They outgun me 1 0 to one . - My lord . The enemy commander wishes a truce to confer . Put him onscreen . This is Admiral James T. Kirk ofFederation Starship Enterprise . So , the Genesis commander himself . A violation of treaty between the Federation and the Klingon Empire . Your presence here is an act of war . You have two minutes to surrender your crew and your vessel , or we will destroy you . He 's hiding something . We may have dealt him a more serious blow than I thought . - How can you tell that ? - I trust my instincts . Admiral Kirk , this is your opponent speaking . Do not lecture me about treaty violations . The Federation , in creating an ultimate weapon , has become a gang of intergalactic criminals . It is not I who will surrender . It is you ! On the planet below , I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon . If you do not surrender immediately , I will execute them one at a time as enemies of galactic peace ! Who is this ? How dare you take prisoners . Who I am is not important . That I have them is . I will allow you to speak to them . - Admiral , this is Lieutenant Saavik . - Saavik . Is David with you ? Yes , he is , and someone else , a Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance . This Vulcan , is he alive ? He is not himself , but he lives . He is subject to rapid ageing , like this unstable planet . Hello , sir . It 's David . I 'm sorry I 'm late . It 's okay . I should 've known you 'd come . Saavik 's right . This planet is unstable . It 's gonna destroy itself in a matter of hours . David , what went wrong ? I went wrong . I don 't understand . I 'm sorry , sir . Just don 't surrender . Genesis doesn 't work . I can 't believe they 'd kill us for it . Admiral , your young friend is mistaken . I meant what I said . And now to show that my intentions are sincere , I shall kill one of the prisoners . Wait a minute ! Give me a chance to talk ... Kill one of them . I don 't care which . Saavik ? David ? Admiral , David is dead . You Klingon bastard , you 've killed my son . You Klingon bastard , you 've killed my son ! You Klingon bastard . There are two more prisoners , Admiral . Do you want them killed , too ? Surrender your vessel . All right . All right , damn you . All right . Give me a minute to inform my crew . I give two minutes for you and your gallant crew . Take every last man . Form a boarding party , armed heavily . - They outnumber us , my lord . - We are Klingons ! Once you control the ship , we will transfer our flag there and take Genesis from their own memory banks . Mr Sulu , what is the crew complement of a bird-of-prey ? About a dozen officers and men . With some of them on the planet . I swear to you , we 're not finished yet . Bones , you and Sulu to the Transporter Room . The rest of you with me . We have a job to do . Commander , Klingon vessel . Prepare to board this ship on my next signal . No tricks , Kirk . You have one minute . No tricks . I 'm looking forward to meeting you . To the transport room . Success ! Computer , this is Admiral James T. Kirk . Request security access . Computer , destruct sequence one , code one , one , A. Computer , Commander Montgomery Scott , chief engineering officer . Destruct sequence two , code one , one , A , two , B. Computer , this is Commander Pavel Chekov , acting science officer . Destruct sequence three , code one , B , two , B , three . Destruct sequence completed and engaged . Awaiting final code for one-minute countdown . Code zero , zero , zero , destruct , zero . Destruct sequence is activated . Kirk , your time runs out . - All set ? - Aye , sir . Commander , Klingon vessel . We are energising transporter beam now . Transporter , stand by . My lord , the ship appears to be deserted . How can that be ? They 're hiding . Yes , sir , but the Bridge seems to be run by computer . It is the only thing speaking . Speaking ? Let me hear . Nine , eight , seven , six , five ... - Get out ! Get out of there ! - ... three , two ... - Get out ! - ... one . My God , Bones , what have I done ? What you had to do . What you always do . Turn death into a fighting chance to live . Planet core readings . Unstable , changing rapidly . What about surface life signs ? There . No , don 't touch him . Bones . - What happened ? - He gave his life to save us . Rapid ageing . All genetic functions highly accelerated . - What about his mind ? - His mind 's a void . It seems , Admiral , that I 've got all his marbles . ls there anything we can do ? Only one thing , sir . Get him off this planet . His ageing is part of what 's going on around us . Klingon Commander , this is Admiral James T. Kirk . I 'm alive and well on the planet surface . I know this will come as a pleasant surprise to you , but our ship was a victim of an unfortunate accident . Sorry about your crew , but as we say on Earth , c 'est la vie . I have what you want . I have the secret of Genesis . You 're gonna have to bring us up there to get it . You hear me ? I 'm waiting for you . What is your answer ? Drop all weapons ! Over there . All but Kirk . Maltz , prisoners are at beam coordinates . - You should take the Vulcan , too . - No ! - But why ? - Because you wish it . Maltz - activate beam ! Genesis . I want it ! Beam the Vulcan up and we 'll talk . Give me what I want and I 'll consider it . You fool , look around you ! The planet 's destroying itself ! Yes , exhilarating , isn 't it ? If we don 't help each other , we 'll die here . Perfect . Then that 's the way it shall be . Give me Genesis . Give me your hand . I have had enough of you ! Maltz ! Don 't . How many more ? Just him , sir . Bones , help Spock . We 've got to break out of orbit . - You , help us or die . - I do not deserve to live . Fine . I 'll kill you later . Let 's get out of here . Where 's the damn antimatter inducer ? This ? No , this . That or nothing . If I read this right , sir , we have full power . Go , Sulu . Goodbye , David . We are clear and free to navigate . Best speed to Vulcan . Mr Chekov , take the prisoner below . - Aye , sir . - Wait . You said you would kill me . I lied . Spock , for God sakes , talk to me . You stuck this damn thing in my head , remember ? Remember ? Now tell me what to do with it . Help me . I 'm gonna tell you something that I never thought I 'd ever hear myself say . But it seems I 've missed you , and I don 't know if I could stand to lose you again . Ambassador , they are on approach . They 're requesting permission to land . Permission granted . Tell them ... Tell Kirk we 'll be ready . Mr Sulu , you 're on manual . It 's been a while , sir . Here we go . Retrothrusters . Sarek is waiting above , sir . Sarek , child of Skon , child of Solkar , the body of your son breathes still . What is your wish ? I ask for fal-tor-pan , the refusion . What you seek has not been done since ages past , and then , only in legend . - Your request is not logical . - Forgive me , T 'Lar . My logic is uncertain where my son is concerned . Who is the keeper of the katra ? I am . McCoy , Leonard H. , son of David . McCoy , son of David , since thou art human , we cannot expect thee to understand fully what Sarek has requested . Spock 's body lives . With your approval , we shall use all our powers to return to his body that which you possess . But , McCoy , you must now be warned . The danger to thyself is as grave as the danger to Spock . You must make the choice . I choose the danger . Hell of a time to ask . I 'm all right , Jim . What about Spock ? Only time will answer . Kirk , I thank you . - What you have done is ... - What I have done , I had to do . But at what cost ? Your ship , your son . If I hadn 't tried , the cost would 've been my soul . My father says that you have been my friend . You came back for me . You would have done the same for me . Why would you do this ? Because the needs of the one outweigh the needs of the many . I have been , and ever shall be , your friend . Yes . Yes , Spock . The ship . - Out of danger ? - You saved the ship . You saved us all . Don 't you remember ? Jim . Your name is Jim .

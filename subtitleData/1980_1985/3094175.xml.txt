 Will you look at that fellow over there ? I 've never seen anything so disgusting in all my life . I 'll tell you something . He 's staring . I think he 's looking at us . I think we 're being picked up . Oh , it 's too awful . Can you believe it ? They can let creatures like that in here . I mean , really . It 's ... Anne , what 's the matter , huh ? Anne ? Oh ! Oh , help someone , please . Oh ! Please , help . Damn it ! You 're 35 years old , Mr. Vale . Why are you such a derelict ? Such a piece of human junk ? The answer 's simple . You 're a scanner , but you don 't realize it , and that has been the source of all your agony . But I will show you now that it can be a source of great power . Let them in . Not much of a place , is it ? Still , didn 't pay for it , so ... Hurry up . Hurry up ! We can talk now . I would like to scan all of you in this room one at a time . I , I must remind you that the , uh , scanning experience is usually a painful one , sometimes resulting in nosebleeds , earaches , stomach cramps , nausea . Sometimes other symptoms of a similar nature . There 's a doctor present Dr. Gatineau . I know that you 've all been prepared for this , but I thought I 'd just remind you just the same . Uh , there is one other thing . No one is to leave this room once the demonstration has begun . At this point I 'd like to call for volunteers . Anyone . It doesn 't matter . Fine . Just , uh ... Sit right here , please . Now , I 'd , I 'd like you to think of something specific . Something that will not breach the security of you organization . And that you will not object to having disclosed to this group . - Something , uh , personal , perhaps . - All right . Yes , I have something . - Do I have to close my eyes ? - It doesn 't matter . All right . Yes , I have something . All right . Move everybody out ! Now ! Call consec leader ! I want you to come with me . I didn 't do anything . I said I want you to come with me . Come on . Gatineau , come with us . Down there . Quick ! Move it ! Get down ! Give him a shot of ephemeral . Come on ! OK . Take it easy . All we need is to get stopped by a cop . Ah , it 'd serve 'em right . Why the hell did they have to send us to the old factory ? If this guy 's a scanner they don 't want him down at central . They 're afraid of him . He 's a scanner . Hey , where 's security 2 ? - He 's moving up fast on the left . - Hey , man , what 's happening ? Ray , what the hell 's the matter with you ? You gotta pull back behind them , man . Come on ! Ray , I 'm gonna kill you if you don 't do it . Ray ! Oh , my god . Don 't stop ! Move it ! No , we got to get 'em out of there ! We 've got to get in there . They 're charred , man ! You can see them burning . Let go of me ! Those people are dead ! Get up . Let 's get out of here , man ! Come on ! You want to get us killed ? All right . All right . Pipe down ! Last night ... We at consec chose to reveal to the outside world our work with those ... Telepathic curiosities known as scanners . The result 6 corpses ... And a substantial loss in credibility for our organization . So , this morning we have a new director of internal security , - Mr. Braedon Keller . - Thank you . Mr. Trevellyan . Gentlemen , we 're in the business of international security . We deal in weaponry and private armories . We do not trade in fantasy and pipe dreams . Let us leave the development of dolphins and freaks as weapons of espionage to others . Now , with all due respect to Dr. Paul Ruth , I recommend that we drop our scanner program immediately , sir . Dr. Ruth , what 's your response ? Mr. Keller , who composed our audience last night ? We had 25 financial and political V. I.P. S from all over north america . Were these V. I.P. S carefully screened ? The screening process used was very sophisticated , yes . And yet an assassin managed to infiltrate this group . Yes . And killed 6 of our people . Yes . How did he kill them ? We have reason to believe he ... used scanning techniques . Then do you suggest , Mr. Keller , that this highly-skilled assassin - very deadly who embarrassed us all in front of the community we were trying to impress , was himself a scanner ? We believe so , yes . That , gentlemen , is my response . The weapons capability of these , uh , telepathic ... curiosities . Is obvious . If I may , doctor , your program is based on a list of 236 known scanners , - is it now ? - It is . Of that number , Of that number , how many are now working with us ? As of last night , none . Well , then . We don 't even have a program to drop , do we ? It shouldn 't be very painful for anyone . Consec surveillance has gradually lost contact with all the names on our list , and I submit that this ... this is not an accident . I think we 've lost them to a program far in advance of ours . What ? I can 't believe it . I think you might elaborate , Dr. Ruth . In my study of the situation I 've come to the conclusion That there is a scanner underground Developed in north america . It has an organization that 's well-motivated , and it has a leader . Now , that 's ridiculous , doctor . You can 't get 2 of them to sit in the same room together without going berserk . You 're making a very provocative allegation , Dr. Ruth . Who controls this group ? If you study the descriptions in this report , You will find that you probably met him last night . His name is Darryl Revok , and he was on our list . This is total fiction . Mr. Trevellyan , I ... A moment , Mr. Keller . What do you suggest , doctor ? Eliminate the competition . How ? Contact a scanner who is as yet unknown to the underground , convert him to out cause and then send him out to infiltrate the underground . Convert him , doctor ? How ? They 're all pathetic social misfits . Unstable . Unreliable . That is because their unique gifts are not understood , Mr. Keller . There is one point about which there is no doubt at all , and that is that consec was attacked . For our own peace of mind , we have to retaliate in some way , and I think Dr. Ruth 's suggestion is a very interesting one . Except that ... We don 't have ant scanners left to send into the field . As a matter of fact , I do have one , still unaffiliated . Very special one . I don 't suppose you speak much . No . It 's not surprising . With all those other voices in your head how can your hear your own voice ? How can you develop a self personality ? How do you feel ? I feel ... crystal clear . How do you like ... clarity ? I 'm not sure . - I think I 'm a bit afraid . - Why ? I feel so exposed . I can hear myself . You hear your own voice ? - Yes . - Good . You called me a scanner . What is that ? Freak of nature ... Born with a certain form of E.S.P. , a derangement of the synapses which we call telepathy . Could be a disease , possibly , or a result of radiation . We don 't really know why . Who are you ? My name is Dr. Paul Ruth . I 'm a psychopharmacist by trade , specializing in the phenomenon of scanners . The woman in the shopping mall . What were you doing to her ? I wasn 't doing anything to her . It was her . She was ... forcing me ... To what ? To think about her . The 50 people that were in this room they appeared to disturb you . Why was that ? They talked too loud . They talked , and they talked . Really ? I didn 't see their lips move , did you ? No , it was the other voices . The ones without lips . They were drowning me . I couldn 't stop them . The injection I gave you , the needle . What happened to the voices ? They stopped . The drug is called ephemeral . It 's a scan suppressant . It does nothing when it 's given to ordinary human being . When given to a scanner , it prevents the flow of telepathy . It stops the voices . It can help you . How do you know these things ? It 's my profession . This is Mr. Keller . Will my car be ready this evening ? Tell us what you did , please , Darryl . I drilled a hole in my head . - Where ? - Kind of obvious , isn 't it ? Right here . Why did you do it , Darryl ? Why did you drill the hole ? Too much pressure . Had to release some pressure . You wanted to let the pressure out ? You wanted to let something out of your head ? Maybe I 'm so smart I can 't contain the thoughts in my head . You wanted to let something out of your head ? What ? People . There are people in my head . Not enough room for Darryl . You mean voices ? No . Whole people . Arms , legs , hands . What 's that you 've put over the hole ? It 's a door . Put an eye on the door so they won 't know it 's a door and they can 't get back in 'cause this is the eye you know ? Do you think that will fool them ? Sure . Sure it will . - I mean ... - I mean , sure it will , you know ? I mean , is that the only way to ... No ! What do you know ? You don 't know nothing do you ? What 's it like in there eh , lady ? You want to see how to get in ? Ok ? Come with me , Darryl . Get your hands off me . Get your hands ... Get your hands off me ! Get your hands off me ! That 's me , isn 't it ? As you were ... Without ephemeral without guidance . Is he still like that ? Worse . How could he be ? At the age of 22 he was extremely self-destructive . Now , at the age of 35 , he is simply destructive . In many ways , Cameron , he is your enemy . And mine . But I don 't even know him . He ... knows you . Somehow he was able to gather a master list of all the scanners who were ever born . He has sought them out one by one , asked them to join him in an insane crusade to destroy the society that created him . And me ? He was looking for you but I found you first . That 's why you can help me . I don 't understand . All the scanners who didn 't agree to join him were murdered . These murders represent a loss to mankind of the most spectacular human beings that ever walked the face of this planet . Now , you , Cameron and your brothers and sisters can bring a ... a glory and a brilliance ... to our society that has never been seen before . We must stop Revok now . Consec are not ready to give up their program . Paul Ruth came up with a secret weapon . What ? Someone you 've been looking for , I think . A scanner . Calls himself Cameron Vale . I 've seen him . And Ruth knew exactly where to find him . He 's in indoctrination right now . Can he do anything ? What kind of shape is he in ? He seems to function ... But he 's nothing to worry about . He 's weak . Very weak . Welcome to our little psychic gymnasium . Cameron Vale ... You 'll please meet ... Yoga master Dieter Tautz . Mr. Tautz has kindly consented to be your psychic sparring partner . He has publicly demonstrated on many occasions that by the power of his will . He can control his heart rate , his alpha-wave rhythm , and many other supposedly uncontrollable functions of the human body . Are we ready ? Just about . Proceed . If you would be kind enough to sit facing this gentleman here . I want you ... I want you to ... slowly release your scan . Slowly , with focus . I want it to touch his heart but not his brain . You understand ? Telepathy is not mind reading . It is the direct linking of 2 nervous systems separated by space . I want you to make a link ... from your brain ... to his heart . I want your brain to make his heart ... beat fast . Now , if his heart beats too quickly ... then he will take over control of his heart ... and slow it down . Don 't worry about it . All you have to do ... is make his heart ... beat ... fast . Fast . Fast . Now . Fast . Faster . Fast . Fast . Fast ! Fast ! End your scan . End it ! Stop ! Stop him ! End it ! End it ! You were right , Dr. Ruth . It was easy . This man 's name is ... Benjamin Pierce . And these photographs were taken in a prison for the criminally insane . Here 's another one . This is a plaster cast of him at present on display at the crostic art galley . He 's our only lead , a known scanner who may or may not be part of Revok 's underground . Why was he in prison ? He tried to kill his entire family . His father , sister , mother ... At the age of 10 . It was in 1958 . A few years later , he was released . What do they say here ? 'Rehabilitation through art . ' The man has incredible power , doesn 't he ? Power ? Yes , he does . I am Arno Crostic . I 'm pleased you came to my gallery . Are you an aficionado of Benjamin Pierce ? I 'm interested in buying this piece for my apartment in paris . Yes ? But I don 't think it 'll work out unless I can get to meet the artist first . I 'm afraid no . I hope it won 't prejudice you against acquiring this piece , but I would lose Benjamin Pierce for good if I even approached him with the idea . You see , it 's pair of our agreement . He will not meet his public . Maybe you could just tell me where he lives . Then I could approach him myself , and you wouldn 't be involved . I 'm afraid I can 't . Then maybe you could just ... think about ... where he lives . Excuse me . I 'm suddenly ... feeling ill . Arno , what 's the matter ? - Are you all right ? - I will be all right . Come on , Arno . Let me take you back to your office . You 've got to lie down . That 's it . Take me arm . Benjamin Pierce ? Why don 't you leave me alone ? I need some help . You 're the only one that can give it to me . Is that right ? Me ? Yes . Then I think you 're in big trouble , chum . I 've heard you know a man named Darry Revok . Who are you ? I was told you were coming to pay me a visit , Mr. Vale . How did you know that ? Well ... I have friends . I don 't want them ... but I have them . Scanner friends ? What do you mean by that ? I am one of you . - You 're one of me . - Yes . You know what I think ? I think you better tell me what you really want . It 's the voices in my head . They 're driving me crazy . How do you stop them ? Your voices . My art . My art keeps me sane . My art . Sane . I don 't have anything like this . That 's why I have to find Darryl Revok . You ... my friend ... are a liar . Get out . Look , I 'm not leaving here until you tell me where I can find Darryl Revok . No ? All right . Well , then I 'll get out . No ! Find Revok . Find Revok . These are his robots ... killers . He 'll turn you into a zombie , a robot , a killer . No , don 't you let him . There are others . Other scanners . Kim Obrist . Kim Obrist . Kim Obrist . Good evening , sir . Can I help you ? Are there any messages for me ? Your name , sir ? Cameron Vale . Your room number ? 802 . Yes , this package is for you , sir . My name is Cameron Vale . I 've got to talk to Kim Obrist . Come on in . Oh , God . They killed Ben Pierce . Yes . Come on upstairs . Just wait here a sec . Kim , Revoc got to Ben Pierce . He 's dead . This guy 's name is Cameron Vale . I scanned him . He 's for real . He was there when it happened . Sit down . I know you . You were at the gallery . You were looking for Pierce . I need help . Scan together . Scan together and our minds will begin to flow into each other until they become one . One nervous system . One soul . One experience . Beautiful . Beautiful . And frightening . So frightening to lose yourself . So frightening to lose yourself . To lose your will to the group will . To lose yourself to the group self . ... to the group self . No ! The power . The power we can generate we wheb focus our scans together is fantastic . Fantastic . Terrifying . Terrifying . Exhilarating . No ! Aroud the side ! Quick ! Hurry ! Get in ! Let 's go ! Come on ! Kim ? Kim ? Kim , come on . Kim ! Now , I know ... What if feesl like to die . Everywhere you go , somebody dies . Who are you ? Who sent you ? - I 'm a scanner . - Who sent you ? I was found by consec . Consec ? They wanted me to find Revok . I think they want to kill him , but they never told me about you . Tony ! Tony ! Tony . Oh , no . Come on . We got to get out of here . Come on . What happened ? Excuse me . Excuse me . Sir , outside , please . There 's nothing here to see . Go back to the street . Back out . Back out . Oh , it 's on fire ! Let 's get out of here . Let 's get out of here , like , right now . We 'll be all right here for a while . It doesn 't matter . It 's finished . And nothing can stop Revok now . We were the dream . And he 's the nightmare . There 's still us . I can help you . We can destroy Revok together . You ? You 're barely human . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , but you don 't understand . You don 't know Revok . You don 't know how evil he is , how powerful he is . You don 't know anything . What are you doing ? He must have something that will lead us to Revok . Us ? No , not me . There it is . That 's it . That 's it . Dr. Ruth , telephone call , sir . Take it right here . Yes . It 's Cameron Vale . I missed you . I made a breakthrough to Revok . I want to come in . I want to bring you an informant from Revok 's group . That 's excellent . I 'll arrange for you to be brought in . Can you call me back in about 10 minutes ? Ok . Good-bye , Dr. Ruth . All set ? 10 minutes . We may have developed a serious problem . Vale 's coming in . He says he has an imformant from your crew . Now , is that possible ? No , he 's lying . Then why is he coming in ? Maybe he 's homesick . Look , Vale must know something or his informant does . It could be about me and you . Then you 'd better be the one to interrogate the informant . And Ruth will talk to Vale . I won 't be able to prevent that . If Ruth finds out anything , anything at all ... Kill him . Really ? - I thought you didn 't want ... - Kill him . Really . Contact central , this is contact two-niner . Contact two-niner , this is contact central . Security is in place and you are clear to land . Repeat , affirmative to land . I 'm afraid I 'm going to have to give you both and injection of ephemerol . Well , Braedon , no apologies , no vote of confidence , and my man brought back the goods . Why don 't we save the party util we run around with the president , doctor . It won 't take long . I have a way with these creatures . I know that . So does Trevellyan . That 's why he 's asked me to take the informant . You can do what you like with Vale . Well , that won 't work . Police state tactics simply won 't work . Sir . Really ? Why don 't you send a letter to the board about that , doctor ? I 'm sure they 'd love to hear from you . Come in . Welcome . Congratulations . It 's good to have you back home . Where 's the girl ? She should be here . She 's in another room being interrogated . Thought it would be you . So did I. That 's why I made sure that the needles I gave you both were harmlesss . Don 't worry . She 'll be able to protect herself if there 's any problem . Why did you do that ? Gesture of trust to you friend . I have my own methods . I have nothing to hide . Nothing at all to hide . Not even the right program ? The what ? Do you know of a drug laboratory called biocarbon amalgamate ? Yes , of course . I founded it in 1942 . You ? Right , I sold it to consec . That 's why I 'm here . Let 's say that we have a , uh ... genial working relationship . Do you know what that lab does ? It 's been so long since I 've been in touch with them . As far as I know , they ... They make some sort of chemical weaponry among other things . It manufactures ephemerol for Darryl Rovok . It may even be run by Darryl Revok . That 's impossible . No , I was there . I took the place of one of Revok 's men . I saw Revok in the control room . The production of ephemrol is computerized . It 's being manufactured and sent out in huge tankers . Ephemerol has been sent out ? Sent out where ? The answer is in you own computer . The program that controls everything is called ripe , and it 's a consec program . That means that someone here at consec is a trator and that someone is working with Revok . I want you to access the ripe program . I do not have consec computer clearance . Neither do I. But you do have a nervous system ... and so does a computer . And you can scan the computer as you would anothere human being . Come . Hello . Hello . What a pleasant surprise . You 're very attractive . Ok , let 's do it the formal way . - Your name ? - Kim Obrist . Your name ? Not relevant . Now , tell me everything you know about Darryl Revok 's organization . Before I tell you anything , I want to know how you 're going to protect me . When Revok finds out that I 've come here ... He 's going to try and kill me . Miss Obrist , you best protection ... is to tell us everything we need to know . As soon as you do , Revok will cease to be a threat to anyone . Not good enough . Revok 's people are everywhere . And that scares me . To be honest with you , Kim ... The only one you should be afraid of is me . Why should I be afraid of you ? I came here of my own free will . Because ... I know you 're not what you say you are . I want to see someone else . Listen to me ! Listen to me ! Now , I have acquaintances in Revok 's group . They tell me ... They tell me that you have never been one of them . Why are you here ? Why ? Good-bye , Kim . It must be Kim . Where is she ? Where is she ? This is more important . No ! No , this is more important . The computer is more important . Access the ripe program . More important . But the ripe program is the past . Therefore , to access the ripe program is to access the past , no ? Access the past . Access the past . Security ! The scanners , find them and kill them . Put it on the air ! Find them and kill them . Mustn 't happen again . It 's always been there inside me ... Lurking away . Sucking out my joy and rotting my successes . Cameron , oh , Cameron . I have a way with you , Cameron . Mustn 't happen again . Ripe ... ripe , indeed . The ripe program must be stopped ! This isn 't the same thing , you understand ? Not the same thing at all . It 's different . First time was an accident . Fortunate for some ... unfortunate for others . The ripe program is cold and cruel . Very ... very cold . Very cruel . What happened ? Keller tried to kill me . Keller ? Then he 's the one . Oh , my god . Mom , what are you doing here ? I 'm sorry , mom . Mom , I didn 't ... I ... I didn 't mean it . I didn 't mean it , mom . Please ! There was blood on my hand . Secure the computer room ! Blood on my hand . What 's going on ? What the hell is going on ? It 's the scanners , sir . They 're out . Is this the only way we can do it ? If we don 't plug into the computer now , they 're going to reprogram it . What does that mean ? It means that someone has reprogrammed the computer in such a way that the ripe program is locked away inside . Somebody not only threw away the key . He plugged the keyhole . Try it again . Try it again . That 's as deep into it as we 're going to get . Hey , Lee , punch up your internal monitor . - Access is I M 863 . - Why ? What is it ? Someone 's inside this thing right now . Getting the ripe program . How can this happen ? This room is max security . We 're plugged into the telephone system . Anybody who has the proper series of access codes could get in here long distance . You mean , someone 's getting that right now ? Yeah . Damn ! It 's him . It 's Vale . He 's inside . - Is that possible ? - It 's got to be . It 's got to be . I want to hurt him . How can we hurt him before he gets out ? Hurt him ? I don 't understand . Vale 's nervous system and the computer 's nervous system are joined together . He 's scanning it . I want to cripple them both . Or maybe kill them both . How ? I don 't know if it 's what you want , but I could override the max security self-destruct . It 's designed to blow all the circuits in case of anticipated possession of data by unauthorized and unfriendly forces . Do it now . But , sir that would entail a total loss of all data , all programs within the consec system . I couldn 't do that without the written authorization of consec leader . Mister , this is your authorization . Sit down ! Do it now or I 'll kill you . Yes , sir I 'm doing it now . Sir , I have to finish it over there . Sir , this is the last step . - Are you sure ? - Do it ! There 's no need for that . It 's all very quiet . It 's just internal switching . Really ? No one 's ever switched off a scanner before . Whoa , shit ! See , I told you . No fireworks ! Hey , I 'll go find the doctor . All right . I 'll keep an eye on the door . Excuse me . Do you know if the receptionist is coming back soon ? Yeah , I guess so . Thanks . Please , I 'll be with you in a few moments . I have to talk to you right now , doctor . Will you please get out of here ? It 's about this drug , Dr. Frane . I understand you 've been prescribing it to some patients . Excuse me . I 'll be back in just a moment . Just relax . Read a magazine . Where did you get this ? What do you want with me ? Who are you ? What happened ? I was scanned . The woman in the ... in the waiting room . She scanned you ? No , not her ... Her child . Her unborn child scanned me . That 's what the ripe program is . The doctors on the computer list are giving ephemerol to there pregnant patients . - I don 't understand . - Ephemerol ! Ephemerol is creating new scanners . - Hold still . - Oh , god ! - Hold still . - Oh , my god . Ok , ok , come on . Let 's got out of here . Come on , you can make it . Come on ! - Kim ! Kim ! - Vale . Kim . Sleeping beauty awakes . Where 's kim ? The next room . She 'll be awake in a few hours . We don 't want anyone in here with us . This is just between you and me . Where 's your partner Keller ? He should be here . Keller ? Seems he died when you blew up his computer . By the way , that was very impressive . Keller murdered Dr. Ruth . He deserved to die . Shouldn 't mourn the good doctor 's death . You should celebrate it with me . Dr. Ruth was a great man . He tried to help us . He helped me . 'Great man . ' There 's only one person on earth who ever tried to help you and that 's me . You ? You sent your soldiers out to kill me . Never . Never you . I 've spent years looking for you . And then when Keller told me that Ruth had dressed you up and sent you out as some ridiculous amateur spy , I tried to take care of you look after you , guide you to me . Now why would you try to do that ? Who 's your mother ? I don 't know . Who 's your father ? I don 't know . What was your first childhood memory ? I don 't have any . No , you don 't . It 's no accident that you don 't . You were kept on ice . It wasn 't until consec had trouble putting me away that they thawed you out . You 've been monitored every day of your life allowed to live like garbage , scum . He knew where you were but it wasn 't until he needed you that he reached down and hauled you up out of the slime . Who ? Your father ... Dr. Paul Ruth . Our father . No . You 're my brother , Cameron ... my kid brother . No . Sit down . I want to show you something . This was a test campaign used in 1947 to market a new product . The product was a drug a tranquilizer called ephemerol . It was aimed at pregnant women . If it had worked it would have been marketed all over north america . But the campaign failed and the drug failed . Because it had a side effect on the unborn children an invisible side effect . It created scanners . Yes , the man who invented phemerol was very excited by this weird mutation it caused . So was consec . They offered to finance his experiments ... so he sold them his company and himself . And that man was Dr. Ruth ? That was daddy . Now I said that the side effects of ephemerol were invisible but that 's not completely true . Daddy could see them . He could see them in us . He had given the prototype of ephemerol to his pregnant wife , our mother 4 years before it hit the market and then again a year later . These children turned out to be difficult till he realized that the only thing that would calm them down was his drug , ephemerol . That 's why we 're older than all the others . Not only older more powerful . The rest of them they 're nothing compared to us . Then what did you need Keller for ? Consec had hardware . It had contacts . - Keller could see the future . - The future ? You murdered the future . That 's nagative , Cam . Defeatist . Disappoints me to hear you talk that way . You 're starting to sound like them . There 's a whole generation of scanner soldiers just a few months away from being born . We 'll find them train them to be like us , Not like an old person or a band of cripples . Bring the world of normals to their knees . Rule an empire so brilliant , so glorious we 'll be the envy of the whole planet . You sound just like him like Ruth . No , not like him . - Like Revok , Darryl Revok ! - No , like him . It 's as though he 's been reincarnated in you . You 're not listening to me . You 're not cooperating , Cam . You 're not cooperating with me at all . I 've been counting on you for years , Cam . Tell me you 're not going to betray me like all the rest . Tell me you 're not . No ! All right , we 're going to do it the scanner way . I 'm going to suck your brain dry . Everything you are is going to become me . You 're going to be with me Cameron , no matter what . After all , brothers should be close . Don 't you think ? Cameron ? Kim . It 's me , Kim , Cameron . I 'm here . We 've won . We 've won .

 In 1988 , the crime rate in the United States rises four hundred percent . The once great city of New York becomes the one maximum security prison for the entire country . A 50-foot wall is erected along the New Jersey shoreline , across the Harlem River and along the Brooklyn shoreline . It completely surrounds Manhattan Island . All bridges and waterways are mined . The United States Police Force , like an army , is encamped around the island . There are no guards inside the prison , only prisoners and the worlds they have made . The rules are simple - once you go in , you don 't come out . This is Gotham Four . I have an escape in progress . An object at midbay moving toward the wall . You have ten seconds . Turn around . Start back to the island . Gotham Four , confirm the kill . Circle to base . Over . Security , this is Rehme . We have confirmation of a kill at midharbour . Two in the water dead . - Two confirmed . - Very well . Air traffic , this is Rehme . You are now entering the debarkation area . No talking . No smoking . Follow the orange line . The next scheduled departure to the prison is in two hours . You now have the option to terminate and be cremated here . If you elect this option , notify the duty sergeant in your processing area . Hold it . We got a small jet in trouble over restricted airspace . - Where is it ? - Seven miles out and closing . We 've been on the horn but we haven 't been able to reach him . There was a transmission ten minutes ago . He identified as David 14 , then he was cut off . David 14 , acknowledge . David 14 , I 'm calling air rescue . Squawk 7700 , contact on 121.5 . There 's still no reply . Bayonne , I have a Mayday in restricted space . - New York , I have him . - Who is he ? - I don 't know . - You have the code ? - David 14 isn 't on the computer . - Unlisted ? Unregistered . We telexed Washington - still waiting . I think I got him , sir . It 's too late , assholes . All your imperialist weapons and lies can 't save him now . We 're going down . We 're going to crash ! David 14 , acknowledge ! Code 's coming in , sir . Tell this to the workers when they ask where your leader went . We , the soldiers of the National Liberation Front of America , in the name of the workers and all the oppressed of this imperialist country , have struck a fatal blow to the racist police state . What better revolutionary example than to let their president perish in the inhuman dungeon of his own imperialist prison . The bosses of the racist ... Unlock the pod ! - She 's bolted the door . - Shoot off the lock . Sir , it 's pressurised . - How about lifting the door off ? - No , sir . Get me to the pod . This is a locating device in case you 're separated from the pod . I 'm activating it now . God save me and watch over you all . Computer simulation , tracking Airforce One . - He 's down ! - That 's the escape pod . 40 degrees ... 50 yards from impact . I 'm going in . One-W-Larry . Over the Battery . We 're moving down . Crash site ahead . You touch me , he dies . If you 're not in the air in 30 seconds , he dies . If you come back in , he dies . 20 seconds . - I 'm ready to talk . - 19 . 18 . - What do you want ? - 17 . 16 . Let 's go . Let 's go . Yes . He 's right here , Mr Vice President . This is Bob Hauk . If we move in with choppers they 'll kill him . We 're lucky if he 's not dead already . They don 't want anything yet . By then , it 'll be too late . Tell him we have to go with your plan , now . If we have to move in and take the island it 's a last resort . It 's 8 : 45 . I want permission to try a rescue . Thank you . - All right . - He 's dangerous , sir . I know . I 'll be OK . I 'm not a fool , Plissken . Call me Snake . S.D. Plissken . American , lieutenant , special forces unit Black Light . Two Purple Hearts - Leningrad and Siberia . Youngest man to be decorated by the president . You robbed the Federal Reserve Depository . Life sentence . New York Maximum Security Penitentiary . I 'm ready to kick your ass out of the world , war hero . - Who are you ? - Hauk . Police commissioner . - Bob Hauk . - Special forces unit , Texas Thunder . - We heard of you , too , Plissken . - Why are we talking ? I have a deal for you . A full pardon for every criminal action you committed in the US . There was an accident . A small jet went down inside New York City . The president was on board . - President of what ? - That 's not funny , Plissken . You go in , find the president and bring him out in 24 hours , - and you 're a free man . - 24 hours , huh ? - I 'm making you an offer . - Bullshit . - Straight . - I 'll think about it . - No time . Give me an answer . - Get a new president . We 're still at war , Plissken . We need him alive . I don 't give a fuck about your war . - Or your president . - Is that your answer ? - I 'm thinking about it . - Think hard . - Why me ? - You flew the Gullfire over Leningrad . You can get in quiet . You 're all I 've got . I guess I go in one way or the other . Doesn 't mean shit to me . Give me the paper . - When you come out . - Before . I told you I wasn 't a fool , Plissken . Call me Snake . Some of them have cars . They took old junkers and converted them to steam . They may have a gasoline source . And power - rigged-up generators . Some areas have street lights . The crazies . They live in the subways . Complete control of the underground . They 're night raiders . Tracer . Sends a radio signal for 15 minutes . You push it , we can track you . Just like Leningrad ... but they added a safety catch . Where am I landing ? Top of the World Trade Center . They won 't see you and you can take off from a free fall . On the roof is a service elevator . It 's still operational . We use it to infiltrate the prison . There 's a power box . It 'll activate the elevator down to 50 . From there on down , you walk . You can locate the president by his vital signs bracelet . Sends off a sig-pulse . Use this . Homing device . It shows direction and distance . You need a strong antitoxin , stops bacteria and viral growth for 24 hours . - Take off your jacket . - I 'll be all right . Let 's go , Plissken . I don 't like needles . 22 hours , 59 minutes , 57 seconds . We talked about 24 . In 22 hours , the Hartford summit meeting will be over . China and the Soviet Union will go back home . The president was on his way to the summit when his plane went down . He has a briefcase attached to his wrist . The tape recording inside has to reach Hartford in 22 hours . What 's on it ? - You know anything about nuclear fusion ? - All right . It 's the survival of the human race . Something you don 't give a shit about . I 'm going to inject you . It 'll sting for a second or two . That 's it , Plissken . Tell him . Tell me what ? That idea you had about turning the Gullfire around and flying off to Canada . What did you do to me , asshole ? My idea , Plissken . Something we 've been fooling with . Two microscopic capsules in your arteries . They 're already starting to dissolve . In 22 hours , they will completely dissolve . Inside the cores are a heat-sensing charge . Not a large explosive - about the size of a pinhead . Just big enough to open up both your arteries . You 'd be dead in ten or fifteen ... - Take ' em out now ! - They 're protected . 15 minutes before the last hour 's up we can neutralise them with x-rays . We 'll remove them if you have the president . - What if I 'm a little late ? - No more Hartford summit and no more Snake Plissken . When I get back , I 'm gonna kill you . The Gullfire 's waiting . - I 'm ready . - 21 hours . Suppose he 's dead , Hauk ? If I come back alone you 'll burn these things out ? Get ' em both back , Plissken . Remember , once you 're inside , you 're on your own . - I can 't count on you ? - No . Good . Tracer test confirmed at 20 hours , 17 minutes , 30 seconds . Are you picking up the target ? Right on course . Been a while . How 's your altitude ? - What are you doing ? - Playing with myself . I 'm going in . I 'm inside the World Trade Center on the 50th floor . Just like Leningrad , Hauk . - Is the glider intact ? - Yeah but taking off is for shit . I 'll work it out . You 'll have to use the east stairwell . Call me when you get outside . I 'm at the plane . Nobody else made it , Hauk . Wait a minute . I 've got his pulse . Right up ahead . Moving northwest . This is bliss It 's a lark Buddy , everyone 's coming to New York No more Yankees Strike the word from your ears Then the roulette There 's no more opera at the Met This is hell This is fate But now this is your world and it 's great So rejoice Pop a cork Buddy , everyone 's coming to New York You 're Snake Plissken , ain 't you ? - What do you want ? - Nothing . I thought you were dead . You don 't want to walk around down there , Snake . Hi , chief . Nice night . Nice boots . Easy now , chief . I 'm walking . Mr President ? I 'm the president . Sure , I 'm the president . I knew when I got this thing I 'd be president . - Where did you get it ? - I woke up and there it was . Just like a miracle . Jesus ! It may be just an impact on the mechanism itself . I 'm right here , Plissken . I don 't know who you assholes were looking at but it 's not the president . Hail to the chief ... Get your machine ready . I 'm coming out . 18 hours , Plissken . Listen to me , Hauk - the president is dead . You got that ? Somebody 's had him for dinner . If you get in that glider I 'll shoot you down . You climb out , I 'll burn you off the wall . You understand that , Plissken ? A little human compassion . You a cop ? No . You got a gun . You got a smoke ? Keep your hand over it . It 's all right if we 're quiet . They won 't hear . - This is a real one . You just get here ? - What 's going on out there ? Crazies . End of the month . They 're out of food . You live here ? Skulls ? Are you kidding ? I 'm with the Turks now . I got caught after dark . Now I 'm stuck here . A plane crashed seven hours ago . Did you see it ? No . - You 're a cop . - I 'm an asshole . Wait a minute , I know who you are . Yeah . But I heard you were dead . I am . Snake Plissken . All right ! What are you doing here with a gun ? Looking for somebody . - Who ? - The president . Come on . He really here ? Somewhere . When you find him , you gonna take him out ? Take me out with you , Snake . Why ? I can think of lots of reasons why . Where you going , buddy ? Bad neighbourhood , Snake , you don 't wanna be out at night . I 've been driving a cab for 30 years and I 'm telling you , don 't walk around here at night . Yes , sir ! They 'll kill you and strip you in ten seconds . Usually , I 'm not down here but I wanted to catch that show . This stuff is like gold around here , you know . When did you get in ? I didn 't even know they caught you . Snake Plissken in my cab . Wait till I tell Eddie . Hang on , Snake . What were you doing back there ? Looking for somebody . Why didn 't you ask me ? I know everybody in this town . Yes , sir , I 've been driving this cab 30 years . This very same cab ! I 'm gonna ask you . - Now , where 's the president ? - The Duke got him . Everybody knows that . No need for guns . I 'll tell you . Who 's the Duke ? The Duke of New York ! A-number one . The big man , that 's who . I want to meet this Duke . You can 't meet the Duke . Are you crazy ? Nobody meets the Duke . You meet him once and then you 're dead . I hate to leave her on the street . Usually , I don 't leave her alone at all . But you 're a special case , Snake . It 's OK , Snake . It 's a better neighbourhood . You can relax . Thanks . They got a great place - like a fortress . They ? - Who is it ? - It 's me . - Who 's " me " ? - Cabbie . - What do you want ? - Somebody wants to see Brain . - Go away , Cabbie ! - No , it 's Snake . - You 're Plissken ? - He wants to see Brain . Why ? I wanna meet the Duke . You remember this place , Snake . Used to be a public library . Oh , that Brain - he 's the greatest . Mr Fabulous ! The Duke loves him . - Who 's that ? - That 's Maggie , Brain 's squeeze . The Duke gave her to Brain just to keep him happy . See what I mean ? Heard you were dead . I brought somebody to see you . Harold Helman . How you been , Harold ? It 's been a long time . You never told me you knew Snake . Isn 't that great ? Brain , I could use some gas if you can spare some . I 'm glad you remember me . Yeah . A man should remember his past . Kansas City , four years ago . You ran out on me . - You left me sitting there . - You were late . We were buddies , Harold . You , me , and Fresno Bob . You know what they did to Bob ? I 'll spray him over that map , baby . Where 's the president ? - Swear to God , I don 't know ! - Don 't fuck with me . - Why do you want to know ? - I want him . - Working for The Man now ? - I 'll beat it out of your squeeze . Maggie doesn 't know exactly where he is and unless you know exactly , you 'll never find him . Listen , I 'll take you out of here . Yeah . A jet glider just a couple of blocks down the street . All you got to do is get me to him . No kidding ? On the level ? Hey , will you take me , too ? We gotta deal somewhere else . - No glider . - We 've got the president . And the Duke 's taking everybody out . Never happen , baby . You see , I know something you and the Duke don 't know . Only got so long before Mr President doesn 't mean a lot . - You 're lying . - Maybe he 's not . I know him . Look at his face - he 's lying ! Right , Harold . I 'm lying . So I might as well have some fun and keep looking by myself . - Talk to him , baby . - Brain , he 'll kill us ! Tell him ! All right ! You always were smart , Harold . Just one thing , right now . Don 't call me Harold . So you work for this Duke , huh ? Yeah . Make gas for him , figure out things for him . Like what ? How to get across the 69th Street bridge . It 's mined but I know where they are . We got a diagram from a guy that got across ... before they shot the poor bastard . A crew is clearing the first barricade now . What a sight . The whole camp rolling across the bridge and the president right out in front . That would 've been so fine . - It would 've been . - We 're going with Snake now . That 's the Duke . I know the sound of his engines . Don 't cross the Duke . Everybody knows that . Cabbie , you slime ! No , Brain . Let 's get out of here . - He 's looking for you , Brain . - What for ? My diagram of the bridge . When he finds out about you he 'll want my life . I shouldn 't have ... We 've got to get to the president now . Forget it ! He 's on the other side of town . Just calm down . I think they saw us . Turn left . - This is Broadway . - I know . The Duke will take Seventh Avenue . - No . - Yes . Keep driving . What 's wrong with Broadway ? Come on , sweetheart . Come on , Brain . Hold on . He 's in the third car from the end by the last campfire . He 'll go in the front way . It 'll take him five minutes . If you 're not back in four you 're on your own . When we get there you just keep talking . Hi , guys . Hi . How 's it going ? Cooled off a little , huh ? What do you want ? Duke told us to wait inside . He 's on his way . He didn 't say nothing to us . You can 't expect him to tell everybody in the joint . Why don 't we wait outside here for him ? - Why don 't we wait inside for him ? - Cos I got orders , that 's why . What are your specific orders ? Specific orders , Brain , was for me not to let no one go inside . How is the president ? Any political discussions you 've had with him ? That Brain is a real pain in the ass . He 's always sniffing around like a dog . He comes up with the gas . What are you looking at ? - Are you from the outside ? - Stop shaking . I can 't . Who are you ? Hauk sent me . We 've got to move fast . - Move fast ? All right ! - And quiet . They got him . Watch it . Friend of yours , Brain ? He had a gun on me , Duke . There was nothing I could do . Who are you ? I said , who are you ? Snake Plissken , Duke . The Man sent him . Something 's going down . We need him . I 've heard of you . I heard you were dead . Surveillance Four to Security Control . Nothing on the infrared body scan . Nothing in the searchlights . There aren 't any fires on the streets . Nobody moving here . Surveillance Five to Security Control . Negative on infrared . No movement in the searchlights . Something strange going on down there . - We 've got to go in now . - We hold . - You 're countermanding my orders . - This is my prison . - I override all that . - Just try . Surveillance Ten . Still negative on the scan . This is Surveillance Four to Security Control . Nothing on the infrared body scan . I 'll make another sweep . Surveillance Ten . Still negative on the scan . Surveillance Five , negative . The prison 's deserted . There 's nothing moving anywhere . Still circling . This is Surveillance Four to Security Control . Nothing on the infrared body scan . Don 't move , Snake . I want that diagram , Brain . It 's at my place , Duke . Duke , that Plissken said something about a time limit . - What time limit ? - On him . That 's a lot of crap . What did I teach you ? You are the Duke of New York . You 're A-number one . I can 't hear you . You are the Duke of New York ! You 're A-number one ! Get me the diagram . Duke , don 't kill Plissken . We need him . Get moving , Brain . People down in the park . Can you see them ? Surveillance Ten to Security Control , are you getting that readout ? Pulse there on the infrared . We have a visual sighting on it . It 's a crowd of prisoners in Central Park . They 're waving at us . Signalling us . They 're waving us down . I still can 't figure out whether Plissken was telling the truth or not . I hate that guy . - He got in somehow . - Yeah . Yeah , but how ? You 've got to land a glider and take off . Central Park 's got too many trees , Port Authority 's too low ... Unless it was some ... some place high up . The World Trade Center . That 's it . There we go . And it 'll be easier for me to take off than it was for him to land . Amnesty for all prisoners in New York City in exchange for president . 69th Street bridge tomorrow , 12 noon . No bullshit , or he 's dead . - Where 's the tape ? - Not here . They 're Plissken 's . So much for your man , Hauk . Warm up the choppers . We 're moving in . Come on , get up ! They sent in their best man ... and when we roll down the 69th Street bridge tomorrow on our way to freedom , we 're going to have their best man leading the way ... from the neck up ! On the hood of my car ! Let 's do it ! - Where 'd you get the hat ? - Got it from Cabbie . - Traded him . - For what ? - Why are you so nervous ? - Got to see the president . - Who says ? - The Duke . - No , he doesn 't . - I 'll tell him you said that . Wait a minute . Why ? He 's got something hidden in his clothing . - What ? - I 'll show you . - Tell me . - Cyanide capsules . The Duke don 't want a dead president . Gentlemen . Mr President . - Cyanide . - Yeah . He might try to take it tomorrow . That 's bullshit . You 're not supposed to be in here , Brain . Tracer activated at one hour , 35 minutes , 27 seconds . Listen ! The president 's gone ! Brain took him ! Hauk , Plissken 's tracer . Get on the radio . Keep ' em down . Nobody move . He 's approaching the World Trade Center . I knew that son of a bitch was alive . He 's inside . - It 's gone . - The signal only lasts for 15 minutes . Download the choppers . We 're on standby . Anybody could have pushed that button . Only Plissken knew there was a safety catch . We 'll give him more time , just to make sure . Goddamn Redskins ! They 're savages , Mr President ! Snake , I swear , I thought you were dead . You and everybody else . That your car in the lobby ? - Yeah . - Keys . Quick . Quick . Diagram of the bridge . - I 'm the only one who can read that . - Get out of my way . You can 't read and guard at the same time . You shouldn 't have double-crossed me again . - They sawed it off . - The tape ? - Gone . I don 't know where . - I do . I know where it is . Take us to the car . I 'll take you right to it . - Don 't talk . Breathe . - I 'm trying . - Come on ! We 're wasting time ! - What 's wrong ? - It 's dead , Harold . - What ? Here , take this . Car trouble ? Hi , Duke . This whole deal of yours is over , Snake . You and Brain , say goodbye . Go ! - There are three mines here ... - They 're behind us . - They come in threes . - Where 's the tape ? - Where is it ? - Tape from the briefcase . That tape . Here it is . - You traded Romero your hat . - How 'd you know ? See ? The discovery that tritium creates only 1 / 1,000,000 of the biological damage of iodine ... - Give me that tape . - Not just yet . - Easy ! - Go for it , Snake . Slow down a little . - I think there are three mines ahead . - You think ? Stay left . Then jog right when I tell you . You 're pushing her too hard , Snake . OK . OK , now ! I said jog right ! Asshole . Stay to the right . Left ! Hold it ! Left ! Left , damn it ! Keep moving . He 's dead . Come on . Station 19 spotted two cars on the 69th Street bridge . - Plissken ? - Taxicab and a Cadillac . - The taxi hit a mine . - 14 minutes . Get a jeep with a winch there . Cronenberg , get to Station 19 . They 're coming across the bridge . This is Rehme , Security Control . We are to stand by and wait . Repeat - we are to stand by and wait . All helicopters , down . Wall guards , do not fire on prisoners . Repeat - do not fire on prisoners . Wall vehicles , stand by . Repeat - wall vehicles , stand by . You 're A-number one ! You 're the Duke ! You 're the Duke . You 're A-number one . The tape , Plissken . That 's it . I radioed ahead , Mr President . They 're waiting for your broadcast . Yeah . It 's all right . I ... I want to thank you . Anything you want , you just name it . Just a moment of your time . Three minutes , sir . Yes ? We did get you out . A lot of people died in the process . I wondered how you felt about it . Well , I ... I want to thank them , this nation appreciates their sacrifice . Look ... I 'm on the air in ... - two and a half minutes ? - Yes , sir . You going to kill me now , Snake ? I 'm too tired . Maybe later . I 've got another deal for you . Think it over while you 're resting . I want to give you a job . We 'd make one hell of a team , Snake . The name 's Plissken . You 're on camera , Mr President . Good evening . Although I shall not be present at this historic summit meeting , I present this in the hope that our great nations may learn to live in peace .

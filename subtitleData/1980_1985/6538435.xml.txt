 Woman ) ' This is report 105 from Xeno archaeological expedition , team seven . 'Documentation officer Kate Carson reporting . 'The past two months of survey 'have resulted in the discovery of a vast , tomb-like complex . 'This structure was unmentioned 'by the previous and abandoned expedition to this planet . 'Entry to the tomb has now been made , 'and examination of the inner chambers 'may reveal information about the extinction of the race that inhabited this planet . 'Despite the planet 's two suns , 'the surface temperature remains a constant 89 degrees below zero . 'However , underground life-support systems and electrical installations 'are fully operational . 'Safety factor , 60 per cent . 'Conditions ... 'tolerable . ' ( Footsteps , stones crunching underfoot ) ( Heavy breathing ) ( Rocks crashing ) Wind howling in distance ) ( Man over radio ) ' Wait a minute . Take a look at that . 'Dean , shine your torch over here for a minute . ' ( Dean ) ' That 's terrific . 'Looks like there 's another section through here . - ' Dean , don 't wander off too far . ' - ' No , I won 't . ' - ' l want to be able to hear you . ' - ' Yeah , I 'll keep in touch . ' - ( Dean ) ' Hey , this looks interesting . ' - ' What have you found ? - ' Dean ? ' - ' Some kind of wall carving . ' - ' Can you read it ? ' - ' Means nothing to me . ' - ' Can you recognise anything ? ' - ' No . We 'll have to get Mitch . ' 'Well , don 't ... Don 't stay too long . ' - ( Radio noise ) - ' Come back ... Come back now . ' - ( Radio crackling ) - ( Dean ) ' There 's something here . ' - ' Dean ? Ricky ? ' - ( Silence ) 'Dean , can you hear me ? 'Dean , what have you found ? 'Ricky . Ricky , can you hear me ? 'Dean , what 's the matter ? Ricky ... ' ( Distorted scream ) ( Cracking ) ( Cracking , radio static ) ( Alarm blaring ) Move it ! ( Man ) Hang on . Woman ) How long have we got ? ( Second woman ) I don 't know . ( Clunking , air hissing ) ( Radio ) ' Can you hear me , Ricky ? ' - l 'll take him . - ( Radio ) ' Get his legs up . ' - OK , get him up . - ' Come on , Sandy , let 's go . ' OK , Sharon , come on , move it . What happened ? What about Dean ? - l don 't know . - ls there much damage ? One sector 's knocked out . You 'd better go and see what you can do . The voice communicators don 't work in there . Gary , this is Holly . Respond . 'Gary , will you answer me ? ' 'Yes , what is it ? ' - Did you check the communicators ? - ' l did . ' 'We had a problem with the tomb , the communicators are dead . ' - ' Sounds like a frequency block . ' - Damn it , that can 't be right . Get your ass up here on the double . I want to know why we have this problem . " ' Get your ass up here on the double . " l know what I 'd like to do with her arse . ' ( Man ) 22 ... - How is he ? - .. 31 ... 40 . OK , let 's get his suit off . How is he ? - What 's that in his hand ? - Don 't . - Get an isolation unit . Come on . - What is it ? Holly , give me half an hour , then you can talk to him . OK . I want to know what kind of crystals these are . - l 'll run some tests . - OK . ( Rumbling ) ( Garbled radio transmissions ) ( Eerie rushing sound ) This is Xeno subsatellite research team seven , archaeology team documentation officer conducting interview ... 273 with Commander Holly McKay . Holly , what can you disclose about this accident ? We have no idea what caused the explosion . Our photographer , Ricky Williams , was there , and narrowly escaped serious injury . Dean White has yet to be located . - Will we have to extend ? - There 's no way we can extend . There 's no telling how long it 'll be before Xeno can slot us in again . - That 's all I can say . - Thank you . 'Holly . We 've got Dean . ' is he dead ? Technically , he 's still alive . ( Laboured breathing ) Anything you can do ? I 've done everything I can . I 'll just keep him alive until we get him back . ( Laboured breathing continues ) Holly , we must get back into that tomb . That may prove unfeasible . Mitch thinks the planet was ruled by twins . That 's right . The inscriptions indicate an interesting belief in mythology . Everything seemed to happen in pairs . I 've never come across anything like it . There are two suns , maybe that 's the reason . You know , the creation of the previous race fascinates me . There seems to be a chemical intelligence present . - You OK ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . I want to know what caused that explosion . We 're not gonna change our departure time but this needs to be investigated . Sharon , do you have any information about those crystals ? I 've only just started the tests . But there seems to be some sort of ... energy force surrounding the crystals . This team isn 't prepared for the contingencies we 're facing now . If it was up to me , I 'd say abandon and get taken off . It could be years before anybody came back . Perhaps never . All our work would be wasted . Listen , I 'm not feeling too hot . I think I 'd better get some rest . Take care of yourself , Rick . There 's still the question of the explosion . We 'll leave it for someone else to find out . Unknown energy fields are beyond our range . Barbra , let 's tell Xeno to take us off , please . They 're gone for 72 hours , they 're in orbit . As soon as you can , then . And I don 't want anyone near that site without my permission . ( Phone buzzing ) ( Buzzing ) - Mm-hm ? - ' Gail here . 'Sorry to bother you , Mark , but I 'm getting an electrical disturbance from the lab . ' - l 'll hurry down and check it . - ' OK . ' - Gail , would you do me a favour ? - ' Yes ? ' - Uh , ask Sandy to meet me there . - ' Yes , OK . ' OK , thanks a lot . ( Machines whirring ) ( Click , whirring stops , restarts ) ( Click , whirring stops , restarts ) Hello . I love you . Mmm. I love you too . ( Clicking , whirring ) ( Clicking , whirring ) ( Both laugh ) What 's the matter with the lights ? - l don 't know but I think it 's kinda great . - ( Laughs ) ( Breathing heavily ) ( Moaning ) ( Faint crackling ) ( Crackling intensifies ) ( Gasps ) Erm ... What exactly have you discovered from the inscriptions inside the tomb ? I found some very disturbing elements which , at the moment , I don 't fully understand . Now , the previous inhabitants were obviously highly intelligent , but there seems to be a form of , uh ... self-destruction ... Mitch , sorry . Er , Kate ... Holly wants photographic evidence of the damage caused by the explosion . What 's that got to do with me ? You and I have been assigned to do it . Holly said she didn 't want anyone to go out there . Yep , that 's more like it . We should get some evidence . Do you want to take some photographs ? - l don 't know. I 'll be glad when we go home . - Yes , I know what you mean . Hey , Ricky . What 's wrong ? - l 've got to find Dean ! - Ricky , come here . - What 's up with you ? - Get out of my way ! Ricky , it 's all right . Listen , Ricky . Listen to me , Dean 's not in there . - ( Grunting ) - Let go . Let go ! - ( Mark choking ) - No ! Stop it ! ( Alarm blaring ) ( Groaning ) ( Mark ) See to him . ( Mark ) Ricky ! Ricky ! Hey , Ricky . ( Yells ) - Are you OK ? - No , no , no , let 's go . What 's down there ? - Where does it lead to ? - l don 't know but I 'm gonna find out . - Will you be all right ? - Yeah . - Where does it go ? - The track . - l 'll check the other route . - We 'll go to the monitors . ( Panting ) Whirring ) Get to Operations , Barbra . ( Panting and gasping ) - ( Yells ) - ( Shrieks ) ( Both grunting ) ( Screaming ) ( Panting ) Oh , no ! - He 's left that outer door open . - He can 't stay out there for long . Gary , do you see him ? Yes , I can . Just wandering around ... as if he 's lost his sense of direction . I 've lost him , Holly . ( Garbled radio transmissions ) ( Gail ) ' Ricky ? ' ( Screams ) ( Gasping ) ( Holly ) Gail , get over here , quickly ! ( Gail gasping ) ' l ... can 't . ' 'l can 't , Holly , my foot 's stuck . ' Gary , any way to override the lock on this door ? I 'm not sure. I 'll get Barbra to check the main computer . ( Gail gasping ) lf Gary can get that door open , you can get out , right ? - Right . - OK . Get this off . - How long have we got ? - Two or three minutes . - Let 's do it slow . Come on . That 's it . - There must be a way to override that lock . 'Gail , you must get here quickly . 'We need to close the airlock . ' ( Panting and gasping ) 'My thermal unit 's gone . ' - ( Sobs ) - ( Gary ) ' OK , Gail ? Gail . ' This is Gary . Now listen to me . You must connect the blue and yellow leads . Repeat , connect the blue and yellow leads . 'That will bypass the thermostat . ' We can 't get to you , Gail . You have to do it yourself . Come on , Gail . ( Sobbing ) ' Oh , Gary ... ' 'l can 't do it . You 've got to help me . ' l can 't help you , Gail , you 've got to help yourself . The blue and yellow leads . 'Oh , Christ , I 'm freezing . ' ( Barbra ) ' Her temperature 's dropped . ' ( Gary ) ' Connect the leads . ' ( Gail ) ' Bloody gloves ! ' ( Barbra ) Down to 36.5 . 'Gary , I can 't do it ! ' 'Can 't is a word I don 't understand . Now do it , Gail . ' - You can 't give up now . - 36.2 . 'Oh , Gary , I 'm gonna die out here . ' - She 'll go into hypothermia . - l can 't help you , sweetheart . 'Oh , please , Gary . ' - ' 35.6 . ' - ( Sobbing ) '35.5 . ' You must do it , Gail . Connect the wires . The blue and the yellow . Gail ! Listen to me ! ( Barbra ) She 'll go unconscious any minute . Gail ! 'No , Gail . Gail ! 'Reconnect the life-support ! ' Reconnect the life-support ! - 34.8 . - Gail ! This is Gary . Listen to me , Gail . 34.7 . ( Breathing rapidly ) Gail . Gail ! Whirring ) Bypass the thermostat , woman ! Damn you , woman ! - ( Grinding ) - ( Muffled screams ) ( Shrieking ) ( Squelching and grinding ) Whirring stops ) ( Garbled radio transmissions ) ( Gasps ) 'Kate , come here and shut the door . ' 'Oh ... ' 'Kate , come over here . That 's an order ! ' 'Oh ... ' ( Air hissing ) ( Clunk , air hissing ) 'Get out of my way . ' ( Growling , breathing heavily ) 'Ricky , get out of my way . Ricky ! ' ( Beeping ) ( Gunshot ) ( Quiet groaning ) ( Beeping continues ) Well , what would you have done ? You didn 't see him in that tomb . He was ... Then I just ... I ... - ( Gulps ) I just freaked . - ( Barbra ) Did you have to kill him ? It 's very easy for you to talk here in the operations room . He was out of his mind . That outer door was open . What would 've happened if he 'd opened the inner one ? Any of you could 've found yourself in the same situation . What would you have done ? It 's all right . Calm down . ( Sobbing ) What do you make of Ricky 's behaviour ? Well , he was obviously exposed to something out there . What it is , I 've got no idea . There is a chance it 's to do with the crystals . - ls there a contamination problem ? - Not necessarily . The crystals have been in the station 24 hours but Ricky was showing symptoms long before that . I think it must break the skin , as in Ricky 's case , or have some form of close contact . My tests don 't show any organic matter . What do you think they could contain ? We 're gonna have to get samples because people are gonna wanna look at it . Holly , surely there 's no obligation to continue . I know , Kate , but it 's my job . You want to be careful with that , Mitch . Yeah . You know , there 's something about these crystals that we haven 't discovered yet . Now ... their energy must have something to do with a life source . Do you mean there might be something out there feeding on them ? ( Rumbling ) Wind howling ) - We 'll lose audio here . - OK . Stay close , huh ? Don 't worry , I will . ( Garbled radio transmissions ) ( Rumbling ) ( Garbled radio transmissions ) ( Low rushing sound ) ( Echoing screams ) ( Screaming ) Sandy ! ( Yelping ) ( Shrieking ) ( Crunching and squelching ) ( Air hissing ) ( Silent ) ( Silent ) - ( Gasping ) - lt 's all right . Come on . Wailing sobs ) Sh-sh-shh . Sandy , Sandy . It 's all right . Come on . She 's calming down . What happened out there ? ( Gasps and shrieks ) - We shouldn 't have brought him in . - l have to examine him . Give her one of your shots . Sandy , do you hear me ? - She 's in no condition to talk . - l 'll put her in condition . - She needs to rest . - ( Sobbing ) Sandy , we have to know what 's out there . - Try , Sandy . - ( Quiet moaning ) - Try . - Leave her alone . She can 't hear you . Listen , Sandy 's in a deep trauma . ( Moans ) No ... I think she 's been literally scared out of her senses . No ... ( Eerie , hollow whooshing ) Whooshing continues , low rumbling ) ( Sighing ) How do you feel ? - Thirsty . - l 'll get you a drink . - You got any pain ? - No . Thanks . ( Swallows loudly ) - l feel sick . - ( Sharon ) Hang on . - Come on . - ( Retching ) ( Coughing ) OK . - ( Sighs ) - Get your legs up . - Sandy , I want you to take these . - Oh , I couldn 't . Ooh ... Ahh ! - Does that arm hurt ? - Yes . - You gave me an injection , didn 't you ? - Yes . But in the other arm . - Let 's have a look . - Ooh . ( Yells ) Come on , Sandy , come on . It 's all right . Come on , come on , back you come . There we are , it 's all right . Now listen , Sandy , we 're going to give you a thorough examination . Holly . Yes , Karl ? Problem ? - Yes , it 's Sandy . - Oh , how is she ? She 's fine as long as I keep her sedated . Remember the marks on Ricky 's hand ? - Yes ? - She has one on her arm . - Oh , Christ . - That 's not all . As you know , I perform certain medical duties . - What are you getting at ? - including injections to restrict ... - Are you trying to tell me she 's pregnant ? - Two months . That can 't be , we had our injection the same time . ( Eerie , echoing voices ) ( Gasping ) ( Echoing ) Please ! No ! ( Echoing ) No ! No ! ( Crashing ) ( Low , echoing rumble ) Jesus . - Now we 'll never know what happened . - That 's the end of our project . All right , what 's Xeno 's position , Barbra ? We should be able to make contact in six hours . Well , then all we can do is wait . ( Computer rattling ) ( Crackling ) ( Crackling intensifies ) ( High-pitched throbbing ) Mm ... ( High-pitched whirring ) Ah ... ( Noise stops ) Hi . Feeling better ? I tell you , I can 't wait to go home . Don 't know about you but I 've had this mission . Don 't know what 's going on but whatever it is , it 's weird . I agree with Kate completely . We should abandon and go home . Can 't wait to go home . ( Screaming ) ( Grunts ) ( Grunting ) ( Screaming ) ( Choking , rasping breaths ) ( Gasping ) ( Sandy weeping ) ( Sandy ) Go away . Go away ! - ( Holly gasping ) - l said , go away . Holly , go away ! ( Shrieking ) Go away ! ( Screams ) ( Screaming ) - Hey , there 's Sandy . - What are they up to ? Mmm ... Ah ! Ow . Ooh . ( Gary ) ' Pay attention , please . 'Secure all stations . Remain just where you are . 'Secure all doors . Do not admit anyone . 'Repeat , do not admit any personnel . ' - ' Mark ? ' - Yeah , Holly ? - ' Mark ? ' - What 's going on ? 'Sandy 's killed Barbra . ' - What are you talking about ? - ' Listen , she 's killed Barbra . ' - l don 't understand . - ' No time to explain . 'You gotta reach Sharon right now . ' - Where 's Sharon ? - ' ln her quarters , I hope . 'Mark , please be careful . ' ( Moans ) ( Sighs ) - Who is it ? - lt 's Mark . - What do you want ? - Open the door . No . Quit screwing around and open the door . We 've all had instructions to keep our doors locked . I 'm ordering you to open this door . - My instructions came from Holly . - Well , get her on the communicator then ! Control ? I 've got Mark outside the door ... ( Holly ) ' Well , open it ! ' ( Sighs ) - Come on , Sharon . - ( Phone buzzing ) - ( Holly ) ' Are you there ? ' - Yeah . - ' Mark , are you with Sharon ? ' - Yeah , I 'm here , she 's here . 'Bring her up here now . No , no , no ... - ' Go to the mess hall first . ' - What for ? - ' We may need food . ' - OK . - ' Be careful . ' - Yep . - What 's going on ? - Come on , I 'll tell you later . ( Switch clicking ) Number three scanner 's gone dead . Damn it , four 's gone now . At least she 's nowhere near those two . - ( Metal scraping ) - What 's that ? I don 't know . Come on . I 'll take that . - ( Switches clicking ) - Can 't you fix it ? I 'm trying , Holly , I 'm trying . - ls there something wrong with the videos ? - You got it . We 've lost six . - Did Sandy do that ? - Yes , she did . - Why would she knock out the videos ? - l 'll take care of this , Gary . ( Descending whirr ) ( Smashing ) - That was a smart idea . - Switch on emergency . Where 's Kate ? ( Ascending whirr ) ( Footsteps ) ( Grunts ) ( Groans ) ( Kate whimpers ) ( Screams ) ( Screaming continues ) ( Grunting ) Kate . ( Kate whimpering ) ( Grunts ) ( Panting ) - She is very strong ! - What weapons have you got ? - We 've got to stop her , not hurt her . - The only way to stop her is to kill her . What do you suggest ? Do you know anything about that , Kate ? Explosives . Where would you detonate ? She could be anywhere . - Unless you were on the spot . - We could use the touch burner . It 's for heat sealing . Burn right through her brain . ( Computers beeping ) ( Switch clicks ) - ( Switch clicks ) - ( Electronic whirring ) ( Switch clicks ) ( Beeping continues ) - What do you suggest ? - Keeping her alive ! He 's the doctor , ask him . How to keep her alive ? - l could inject her with a drug . - Shall I hold her arm for you ? She 's pregnant , Kate . That 'll look great on the report . " The team were terrorised by an expectant mother . " - ( Alarm ) - She 's blowing up the place . Transmitter 's out . She 's thinking fast . - What about the Xeno ? - Out of contact . - ( Sandy , sobbing ) ' Someone help me . ' - She 's in the exercise room . - Holly , I 'm going to her . - Don 't be a fool , Karl . - l 'm a doctor and she 's in pain . - ( Sandy wailing ) - She might be hurt ... - l 'll decide who goes ! - lf l restrain her , can you sedate her ? - l 'll get my things . - Where 's the touch burner ? - Preparation chamber . - Stay here , Gary . - Yes , sir .

Have you seen her ? - What is it ? - lt 's her leg . - ( Kate ) Let me have a look . - ( Sighs ) Where are the others ? - ( Kate ) Come on , it 's all right . - Gary , I don 't know . She 'll be OK , it 's not broken . ( Mark ) How are we gonna stop this ? If we can get to the space preparation chamber ... - lt 's no good . - We 've got to try . - There are chainsaws . - She 's too strong . ( Sandy ) ' You can 't get away from me , you know . ' lt doesn 't matter what you do , you 'll have to come out sometime . There 's no other way . So why don 't you ... all just come out now ? Mark ? 'Mark . 'l 'm waiting for you . ' This is our chance . 'For you . 'You needn 't be like the others . ' What do you think ? You keep her occupied , we 'll get the equipment . Why don 't you just ... open the door ?

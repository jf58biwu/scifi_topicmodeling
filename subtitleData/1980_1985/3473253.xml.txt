There appeared 3 rebel elements- - What you would call on earth criminals . Criminals ? My kind of people . We were unable to change their evil natures . As you know , we had no death penalty . Sensible enough . Therefore , our scientists constructed the phantom zone . In it we placed these 3 arch-Criminals , Imprisoning them there for all eternity . No possibility for parole ? Your father , Jor-El , Thought long and hard upon that question ... I asked the right question . And there is one danger . The phantom zone might be cracked By a nuclear explosion in space . I wish you had not asked me that . I didn 't ask anything . We don 't know what would happen If they were to escape . On krypton , these villains were uncontrollable . On earth , they would have the same powers , Each one of them , that you have . Think of it . 3 , count them , 3 supervillains- - Each one with his power , Each one totally dedicated To corruption , violence , and evil . That explains the 3 alpha waves i 've been getting .

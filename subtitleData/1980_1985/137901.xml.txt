I feel responsible √ù 'll get the operation and get back on my board You guys , seriously , thank you . Sure , we 're happy to help . Not a problem , man . I 'm just along for the ride , but you 're welcome . You didn 't have to do this . Come on . Yeah , we did . I mean , Chili 's out of town , ur mom 's at work ... We weren 't going to let you take the bus . Yeah , taking the bus never seems to end up well around here . It 's this one up on the right . The one with the white trim ? No , it 's the one next to it . The Infinity Pool 's in the back . Dude , don 't even worry about it . You should see where Ryan grew up . We 're moving soon . After I go pro , a year on the circuit , save some money , buy my mom a house on the flower streets . I may seem a little optimistic now , but ... No . Thanks again . Yeah , see you . Here , let me help you . No , I 'm fine . You 're all going to be late for school . Don 't forget . Oh , thanks . All right . Okay , definitely not fine . I can 't watch this . I have a free period right now . You should stay , help him get settled . You think ? See you tonight . We 'll catch up , get something to eat . Okay , thank you . no , no , it 's fine Don 't speak . The kid has no one . And I trust Marissa . - = The O.C. = = The O.C. = - - = The Disconnect = - so i was thinking our new bussiness But we 've got everything . could provide sth that 's missing in Newport . Not a great bookstore . Latest fiction , authors giving readings ... Ah , interesting . But I was thinking that our new business could provide something that Newport actually wants . Okay , Julie , what 's your idea ? I was reading in Stuffvice . We can get this girl come and clean your house . I think they 're called housekeepers , and Newport is definitely on to that trend . Not housekeepers , nude maids . Who wants to see their maids nude ? Not maids , Kirsten , they 're strippers . Who wants a stripper doing their laundry ? Well , as long as she knows how to iron my shirts the way I like them , wrinkle - free and not too starchy . See , Kiki ? Sandy gets it . Just a few weeks at the Newport Group , he 's already thinking like a businessman . You 've got to give the people what they want . Exactly . And right now I 'm trying to give people without a lot of money a decent place to live . Matt set up a big meeting with some potential investors . Sandy , I don 't think I 'm in favor of low-income housing . Julie , you live in a trailer park . And I 'm highly motivated to change my circumstances . If you make being poor too comfortable , what 's the incentive to get rich ? Believe me , if anyone should know ... Well , on that uplifting note , I 'll leave you two to hash out the finer points of the free-market economy . Look , why don 't we do something that we know Newport needs and we 're already good at . I 'm blanking . Party planning . I 'll cater charity events , private dinners ... We know all the vendors , all the sites , already have a huge client base . I 'm in . Has Marissa called ? I just dropped her off . Why would she call ? She 's busy . Hey , guys . Can 't talk . I have to go see Dr. Kim . You in trouble ? No , I have to change my college file . I got my SAT score . Summer , we got our SAT scores back months ago . Oh , well , I took mine late , remember ? There was Valley time around . - How 'd you do ? - Ryan , come on . You never ask a lady her age , weight or SAT score . I got a 2300 . What , that bad ? That ... good . Hmm ? As good as you , Cohen ? - Better . - By just the tiniest bit . You know , I read a study once that said that if 1,500 third-graders took the SAT , one would get a perfect score by probability alone . Yeah . I 'm not a third-grader , Cohen . No , no , I 'm not saying you are . But , I mean , how else do you explain it ? I don 't know . How is that even possible ? She did save Chrismukkah . Okay , so you 've got your blanket pillows , um , what else ? The remote , magazines ... All right , just call me if you need anything , okay ? Don 't wait by the phone . I mean , since you pretty much thought of everything . Well , maybe I should stop by after school . - Give you your homework . - I 'll get it later . Is everything okay ? Because if I didn 't know any better , I 'd think you were trying to get rid of me . Whatever you could do would help . Ma , hey . Please , call me when you have some information . Thanks again . Hi , baby , how you feeling ? Okay . Ma , this is ... The famous Marissa Cooper . Hi . Come here , sweetie . Oh , Johnny talks about you so much , I feel like I know you already . You didn 't tell me she was gorgeous . Ma , you 're embarrassing her . Sorry . Listen , thank you for bringing him home . I tried to get someone to cover for me at the nursing home , but no one wants the night shift . Go figure . Marissa has to get to class . You 're going to make her late . Just wait . I 've got some good news . I got you an appointment ... with the best sports medicine doctor in all of Orange County . A real fancy orthopedic surgeon , works with the Angels and the Ducks . Thanks , Mom . One hitch . Being that he 's so in demand , there 's a wait list , and the wait 's going to be a little while . What , like a week ? It seemed kind of more like months . But the team will be gone then . - I 'll miss the tour . - I know , honey but there 's always next year . And maybe there 's a way to get moved up on the list . No , no , I tried . But you know , they give these favors to friends and donors to the hospital . Babe ... I 'm sorry . I did the best I could . - Hi . - Hey . You 're not going to believe this . So it turns out that I am totally smart . Yeah , you are . In your own way . Not in my own way , in your way , too . Apparently , I have a lot of what they call " aptitude . " Really ? Dr. Kim told me that , like , every few years she has a female student that turns out to be , like , academically gifted , but just didn 't apply herself . You know , just focusing more on boys and shopping and celebrity gossip . But she said if I study for my finals , I could get my grades up enough to go to Brown with you . Wouldn 't that be awesome ? Yeah . Sure , but , you know , do you want to go to Brown ? Now I do . Dr. Kim said that you can make your own major . And the school colors are seal brown . How cute are seals ? And then look , they 're having this thing tomorrow , for prospective students , and I thought we could go together . Okay , yeah . Mm . Sounds like a date . Okay . - What you reading ? - Hmm ? Oh , it 's just Fear and Trembling . It 's Kierkegaard . He 's the godfather of existentialism . Sort of invented the concept of angst . Well , now that I 'm smart , I 'm sure I 'll enjoy it . All right , I 'll do the welcome , present the model ... I 'll follow up with the numbers . What abouthai for dinner ? Sounds great . Happy days are here again . You two are so perfect together . It 's almost painful to be around . Well , we 've been working on it for about 25 years . You 're bound to get it right eventually . What about you ? There 's a girlfriend in Chicago ? Yeah , yeah . She 's a great girl . I look forward to meeting her . Well , here 's a couple of guys who know a thing or two about romance . Seth , Ryan , meet Matt Ramsey . Matt , meet my boys . Hey , there . Matt and I are working on the proposal for our affordable housing development . Oh , that 's my cue to go help Mom with dinner . This is it , huh ? Yep . It 's an early version , but pretty much . You guys probably don 't want my two cents , but , uh ... What ? No , no , no , go ahead . Well , you put a wall up here , it turns this whole space into a courtyard . Add some benches , a playground , good idea . It 's just a thought . You 're a senior , right ? - Applying to college ? - Yeah . What would look better on a resume than an internship with a prestigious development company ? I mean , if it 's cool with the boss . We could use the help . You got any plans tonight ? Uh , yeah , my girlfriend . Cancel them . Well , this is the doctor 's home page , and it says here he works out of Hogue Hospital . My mom done a bunch of charities for them and Summer 's dad even works there . So this is kind of perfect . Marissa , I appreciate everything , but ... you can 't do this . Why ? Because I might one day decide to become a surfer , get hit by a bus , need surgery , and then realize I used my one good favor with the best doctor in town ? Yeah , I don 't think that 's going to happen . I just don 't want you to think this is your problem . Too late . Hang on . Summer 's picking me up . Oops , sorry . Hey . Hey . You ready to go ? Oh , it 's Ryan . We 're supposed to have dinner tonight , I should ... Hi . You have to help me . I thought Marissa was helping you . She is . She 's driving me , feeding me , bringing me my homework . Now she 's trying to get me in with some doctor . Well , she 's a good friend . I don 't see the problem . She 's too nice . She 's spending too much time with me . Well , she tends to be a little clingy . No , it 's not that I don 't like it . It 's that I do . A lot . I called this , like , so long ago . This , this is a major problem . Not for anybody but me , okay ? Just don 't tell anyone . Promise ? Yeah . Hey . What I miss ? opping me , Sum . Hey , you think maybe you could pick me up , too ? Oh , maybe you should ask Ryan . Oh , I think he 's gonna go to the Newport Group after school . Oh , I guess I could swing by Union . actually , can you pick me up at Johnny 's ? 'Cause I 'm gonna drop off his homework , and hopefully , he 'll know about the doctor by then . Hey , you think maybe you could ask your dad to put in a good word ? Yeah , I guess . Are you sure , I don 't know , that that 's the best idea ? You being all involved in Johnny 's life ? You guys are getting really close . Yeah , well , he doesn 't really have anyone else . I mean , his mom 's sweet , but it just seems like everything 's kind of hard for her , you know ? I 'm just trying to help . Okay , I 'll talk to my dad . You know , the sooner that Johnny gets on his feet , the sooner you don 't have to be his nursemaid . I kind of like being his nursemaid . You know , maybe I should be a nurse . xxx So was Marissa totally cool with you canceling on her last night ? Didn 't have a problem with it . But do you have a problem with it ? I canceled on her . Yeah , but if you canceled on me , I 'd have a problem with it . And , you know , if I canceled on you and you didn 't have a problem with it , then I might have a problem with that . Sounds like you already got a problem - and not with me . Who would my problem be with ? I don 't know , ' cause I think it 's really great that Summer 's a genius . Whoa , whoa , no.Listen , Dr. Kim said she had some untapped potential , and no one went around using the " G " word . Don 't do this , man . - Do what ? - Compete with Summer . Why , because you think ... Summer would win ? So I figured out what our startup costs will be . Do you want to share an appetizer ? Crap cakes ? Sounds good . We can charge food and liquor on a per-event basis . Dishes and linen , we have to figure out whether it 's worth buying our own or not . Mm , you know what I 'm really craving ? The sweet corn ravioli . Or do you think that 'll be too heavy with the crab cakes ? What I think is , is that you don 't find this business very interesting . Oh , I 'm sorry . Kiki , I 've just been eating a lot of ramen lately . Julie , if this business works , you 'll never have to boil your dinner again . I hadier list . I left it in the car . I 'll be right back . I 'll decide on my order while you 're gone . Or ... read some spreadsheets . Right here . So I see you 're suddenly without a lunch date . Would you like to join me at the bar for a drink ? No , my friend will be back shortly . Well , maybe I could buy you both drinks . Well , she 's an alcoholic , and , uh , we 're having a business lunch . We 're partners . In a business . Really . What kind of business ? Well ... Hey , Julie . Kirsten ! Oh , this is Jeff Grenzel . This is my business partner , Kirsten Cohen . Nice to meet you . Uh , we were in the middle of something , if you 'll excuse us . Actually , I invited Jeff to join us for lunch . He just hired us to do a dinner party at his house this weekend . For $ 5,000 . Oh , well , have a seat . Do you like crab cakes ? Hey , Ashley , Mison . Summer , hey . What 's up ? Didn 't expect to see you at a Brown event . No offense . Oh , none taken . Hey , you know , maybe we should just leave . Why ? Well , you know ... You don 't think I belong here . No , it 's not that , it 's just , you know , you don 't have to do this for me . Oh , this isn 't about you . It isn 't ? Beuse this has been my dream for years , and , I mean ... all of a sudden it 's yours , too ? Well , maybe I never had a dream . You know , maybe for once in my life , I actually want to do something with my life , like something important . Be the first woman in space , or win one of those noble prizes . Summer , women have been going to space since the ' 60s , and it 's not noble prize , it 's Nobel . Marie Curie won in 1903 for discovering radium . Well , I think you 've made your point . - hey , hey , don 't leave . - Oh , I 'm not leaving . Look , you may know more about history and science and stuff , but ... I know a thing or two about working a room . Hey , Madison . Wait up . You all right ? Yeah . Uh , I just got a lot on my mind . I promised it wouldn 't interfere with my work . Job means a lot to you , huh ? Kind of means everything . I relocated to do this with Sandy . And my girlfriend , uh ... Well , my ex now , I guess , so ... I took her down to Cabo last weekend and invited her to join me here , as my wife . It turns out she doesn 't like warm weather ... or me . Have you told Sandy this ? It 's not his problem . Sandy 's a good guy . He 's taking a big chance on me . I don 't want to let him down . Yeah , tell me about it . I hate to do this to you , but my plate 's full . Whatever it is , put it right ouof your mind . Ryan and I are on it . It 's already done . There 's legislation in the works that would change the zoning at the site . I need you to work out both scenarios . One if it passes , one if it doesn 't . That means twice the work . Maybe you could reschedule the meeting ? I would if I could , but I can 't ; these guys are coming tomorrow , on a Saturday , and then heading straight down to San Diego to look at another development . 14 hours , laptop , coffee . Ryan and I are good to go . That 's the spirit . Thanks . Hey , are we gonna have time to get ready ? 'Cause if not , we should tell him now . Uh , come on , we 'll take a little field trip . You guys , next year is gonna be so much fun . You know , maybe we should drive together , like , have a road trip ? - shortgun . - Excuse me . If I could have your attention , please ? I want to thank you all for coming . Great group . - So true . - But unfortunately , on average , Brown only admits one student a year from Harbor , and it 's stiff competition . I wish I could admit you all . But enjoy the events , and good luck . Hey , can I talk to you for a second ? No , I need to talk to the Brown guy . Hey , hi . Um , I was wondering , in your opinion , what makes a student stand out ? Yes , besides good gres . And high SAT scores . Well , all our applicants are leaders at their schools . What it really takes is a hook . Fascining . Okay , okay . Could you clarify with an example ? Sure . xxx Next week ! That is great news . I can 't believe it . It 's really not that big a deal . You know , it turns out Summer 's dad 's a plastic surgeon at the same hospital , and they just knew each other . I 'm glad it worked out , though . This calls for some kind of celebration . Marissa , you 're staying for dinner . Mom , I 'm sure she has plans . Oh , I do , actually , with Ryan . That 's her boyfriend . Well , invite him , too . We 'll-we 'll order in . We 'll play board games or watch movies . that 's him Probably wondering where you are . No , he knows . Hey . So do you want to come over to Johnny 's and get take-out and DVDs ? We 're gonna celebrate . Yeah . Yeah , okay , that sounds good . You should ... probably start without me , though . I 'll be there as soon as I can . What 's up ? Hey , it 's cool . He 's with me . Sure thing , boss . Hey , what are we doing , man ? I thought we were gonna go on a coffee run or something . I never said that . Do some of my best thinking here , man . I can see why . Loud music , topless women , no distractions at all . Sometimes a good distraction is the best way to recharge . Right ? And here 's my muse . Lily . Hey , Matt ! How 's my favorite customer doing ? I 'm in need of some serious one-on-one time . Mm , should I ready the Champagne Room for you ? come on , man I got this , all right ? We 're just gonna have a little time-out , then we go back to the office and pull an all-nighter . I got plans . I can 't ... I ... First dance is on me . I 'll be right back . Hi . I 'm Sipowitz . Hi , Sipowitz . I didn 't know Julie was taking this seriously . Well , you got to hand it to her , she 's a born entrepreneur . Hey , I 'm starving . And that actually smells good . Well , it 's not for you . Pizza 's coming . Is that a pirate costume ? Summer and I are in a war . A pirate war ? Well , it turns out Brown usually takes \ only one student from Harbor , and we both want to be it , so I need a hook . Oh , you mean like Captain i 'll get that , maybe it 's dinner Summer going to Brown ? I mean , no offense ... She did save Chrismukkah . Is Ryan eating with us ? No , he 's working with Matt tonight . I think he 's a good influence on Ryan ; you know , he 's young , he didn 't come from much , he 's making something of himself . He 's a good role model . - You don 't have to do this . - Already bought and paid for . Oh , that 's mine . My cell . It 's ringing in my pocket . Mmm , I definitely feel something Yeah , if you could just , uh ... No . Let me . Ah , thank you . Hi . It 's Ryan , leave a message . Hey , uh , it 's me . I was just wondering where you are , so , um , it 's getting kind of late . So call me . Where have you been ? Whoa , Summer . I have been worried sick for hours . Well , since my alarm went off 20 minutes ago and I noticed you weren 't here . Sorry , I fell asleep . Oh , at Ryan 's ? At Johnny 's . At Johnny 's ? We were watching a movie . What 's that ? A tuba . Which you have , why ? Because I do . Because in fifth grade , you know when I said I was going to beauty pageant camp , I was going to band camp and learning to play the tuba . Wait , quit changing the subject . I cannot believe you slept there . Does Ryan know ? Know what ? Uh , how bad that movie was last night . Where were you ? Yeah , where were you ? None of my business . Uh , I was with Matt . Uh , we were working . Wow , so late ? Yeah , big presentation today . So , movie no good , huh ? Yeah , well , it kind of put me to sleep . Uh ... how 's Johnny ? Uh , better , I think . Good , good . Get home okay ? Uh , yeah , yeah , his mom drove me . I just wanted to say hi . Yeah , don 't let me keep you . Okay . Matt , the investors are in the conference room . I need your part of the presentation . Call me when you get this . Matt 's missing in action . Any idea where he could be ? Uh , he was pulling an all - nighter , maybe he slept in ... Right through the alarm . Sorry , Sandy . Ready ? As I 'll ever be . Just let me put my tie on , clear my head . Five minutes ? You 've got four , and you might want to run a comb through your hair . Thanks for not busting me . You gonna make me wish I did ? I know these guys , man . I got it under control . Oh , hey , Ash . You 're not in the band . Well , no , technically not . But I thought I could play the tuba , blow a few minds , maybe get asked to join . What do you ... think ? I 'm a big fan of physical comedy and I 'm extremely limber , plus Johnny Depp has been a huge inspiration in my life . I just think he 's taking the pirate thing to just a whole new level , and ... the brown bear is retiring next year . I told you , we already have a mascot . Oh , my God . - And what 's with the peg leg ? - Why ? It 's really creeping me out . Cohen ! Cohen , what are you doing ? Summer , what are you doing ? I asked first . You know what ? You don 't need to answer that , because it 's obvious . Yeah , I 'm not the one wearing a tuba . Oh , that 's really big talk from a guy wearing hoop earrings . At least I play the tuba . What ? I do . Now if you 'll excuse me , I have to get to practice . Did you just whack me with your tuba ? Did you just jab me with your peg leg ? It was a tap , you little whacker . It was a jab , jabber ! Why do you have to be better than me at everything ? See , that 's just it , Summer . I 'm not better than you at everything . There was one thing that I was better at . And the commercial space at street level can provide jobs , places to eat , a daycare center . Sounds good , Mr. Cohen , but we 've heard there are regulations in the works which could complicate things . So have we . Matt 's worked out both sets of numbers . Matt ? Thanks , Sandy . So if the legislation does not pass , the profit model will look something like this . And if it does ? Um , then we would have to decrease the amount of commercial space , which would , um ... decrease the revenue . By how much , do you think ? I would say a significant amount . Matt , we do business in dollars . How many we talking about here ? Uh ... I 'm ... Well , we haven 't worked out those numbers right now . We didn 't drive all the way down here for a hypothetical conversation . Of course you didn 't . We 'll have those numbers to you by this afternoon . Right , Matt ? Well , thank you , Mr. Cohen , for your impressive presentation . I think we 've heard all weeed to today . Well , thanks for your time . I 'm sorry . Uh , I ... Anything you 'd care to tell me ? Coming . Johnny ? In here ! Oh , my God . Oh , God . All right , come on , here . I think I twisted it again . Okay , come on . Where are your painkillers ? Hello . Good evening . Oh , oh , Jeff . What a beautiful , beautiful place . Thank you . Do you and your guests want dinner in the dining room , or ... Oh , the terrace would be nice . Hmm ! Uh , let me ask my guest . Dining room or terrace ? Excuse me ? I haven 't invited anyone . I was hoping , Julie , that you might join me for dinner . Uh ... Mr. Grenzel , if this is a joke , it 's not funny . I 've spent two days cooking , and Julie bought out the flower mart . One dinner , please . I 'll pay what I promised . I just want the chance to get to know you better . Julie , we 're leaving . Julie . You did all this for a date with me ? Fine , but you 're serving yourselves . Hungry ? Nope . What the hell happened ? I 'm ... I 'm so sorry . That you weren 't prepared for the meeting , I could maybe overlook . That you were here , that you brought Ryan here really tries my patience . But I 'd hear you out . Thanks . That means a lot . But you lied to my face . You disrespected me , and the company I 'm trying to build , the one that you said you wanted to build with me . It won 't happen again . You 're right , it won 't happen again . I want you out of the office tomorrow . You 're fired . Sandy , come on . No , not another word out of you , kid . Don 't think you don 't have anything to be sorry about . Hey , Johnny , do you know where there 's a towel ? I don 't want this ice to melt all over you . so i have to think You know , Marissa ... you 're really making this hard . Making what hard ? We 're friends . Yeah , we are friends . How many othose painkillers did you take ? Uh , I have to tell you something . I can 't say it . Say what ? Don 't say anything back , okay ? I don 't want anything . I just want you to know the truth . The truth about what ? I really like you . Okay , I really like you , too . No ... I mean ... I likee you . i think i love you So , Ryan , you 're a working man now . How 's the job going ? Model homes , calculators , dudes in suits , I bet that 's pretty exciting stuff . You 'd be surprised . So would Marissa . Oh , and what 's she been up to ? I don 't know . I 'll ask her when I see her , which hopefully will be tonight . What 's with all the questions ? Nothing , I 'm just trying to exhaust all your issues so we can get to mine . Have we covered everything ? My biggest fear , stated plainly . What if Summer 's being smart changes our whole dynamic ? Why would it ? Because my intelligence was the one quality she admired in me . It made me almost a man in her eyes . Come on , man . That 's not true . You 've got plenty of other positive qualities . You 're uh , you 're ... you 're funny when you want to be . Have you noticed how Summer 's gotten a lot funnier lately ? I mean , I think she 's funnier than me now . You 're an expert in comic books and Yakuza films . Girls don 't like that . You know how to work a grill . I 'm sorry , man , I 'm sorry . I thought I would come up with more , but the point is , Summer doesn 't want to be you . She wants to be with you . Right ? You want that , too . So ... Apologize , I know . Yeah . Where you going ? I 've got to go to Sandy 's office . I 've got some apologizing to do myself . Give me a ride ? Why don 't we have cars ? Don 't answer it . Johnny 's going to think I 'm mad at him . Maybe that 's not such a bad thing . Look , he was in pain . He took a bunch of pills . He probably doesn 't even remember . It 's not a big deal . Yeah , well , a Vicodin love confession is still a love confession . I 'm sure he didn 't mean it . I 'm sure he did . Why ? Because he told me the night that I picked you up from his place . Why didn 't you say anything ? He made me promise not to . He said he wasn 't going to do anything so he didn 't want you to know . Now I know . What am I going to do ? Pretend you don 't . Maybe you should just stay away from him foa while . I 've got to call Ryan . Are you going to tell him ? These guys won 't return my calls . I can 't even get a response , much less schedule another meeting . Look , I am sorry . Matt said he had it covered , and I guess I believed him . So did I. You know , it makes no sense for him to blow this off . He 's the one who set up the meeting . His girlfriend dumped him . Why , ' cause he went to the strip club ? Because he too the job . I guess it hit him pretty hard . Oh , you 're breaking my heart . He should have said something . Because he didn 't want anyone to know , especially his boss . Sorry for the drop by . Wow , Matt must be some tipper . Matt and I are friends from college . Yes , I went to college . I 'm dancing to pay for law school . But I don 't dance for Matt . Mostly we talk . About what ? Matt 's been under a lot of pressure and not just work stuff . I think he just kind of crashed and burned . Well , he couldn 't have chosen a worse time . I know , and maybe none of this makes any difference , but Matt is a good guy . And this job means the world to him . What if I told you I was the one that put Matt in touch with those investors ? And that I could get you another meeting . Is one your professor ? No , a customer . Dad , Gloria , I 'm heading over to Seth 's . Hi , Seth . Hey , I just came over to apologize . Me , too . Well , no , I mean ... I 'm listening . Okay . Look , I 'm sorry I 've been such an ass , okay ? It 's just you 're so superior to me in so many ways , you know ? You 're better looking , you 're more popular , you 're stronger , and not just emotionally . Cohen . I 'll always look up to you . And not just because you 're taller than me . I am taller than you . You know , that guy from Brown , he didn 't say that they couldn 't take more than one student from Harbor . Hey , well , this might be the year . That 's right . Don 't bother to try and make me feel worse than I already do . It 's impossible . You knew you didn 't do the work . You knew you 'd get caught . You knew how I 'd react . You must have wanted to get fired . Righ since I 'd have absolutely nothing else going for me . The next time you have problem , say something . You need help ? Ask for it . I 'll remember that . Be here at 8 : 00 a. m. on Monday . We 'll give it another try . - You 'd do that ? - Yeah . This is your last chance . Don 't screw it up . You owe me big time . Oh , hey , Julie . How was your date ? Oh , it was awful . We totally didn 't click . We had nothing to talk about , and his tongue was like sandpaper . Sorry to hear that . I 'm sorry , I should never have stayed . It was so unprofessional of me . You made all that food for nothing . Well , it wasn 't for nothing . We got paid . In a way our first venture was a success . Yeah , I guess so . How weird is it that a guy would spent that much money just to have dinner with a woman ? Julie , I have an idea for a new business . Oh , my God . High-class call girl operation . I love it . No ! A high-end dating service . Oh . That could wor too . Hey , Johnny . What are you doing here ? I 'm sorry , you 're on your way out . I won 't be long . I ... God , you must think I 'm some kind of stalker , just showing up here like this . All my calls went to voice mail , so ... Johnny , look , you don 't have to explain yourself . You know , we can just act like it didn 't happen . Those pills will really mess with your head . Believe me , I should know . Look , Marissa , um , I didn 't mean to say those things .

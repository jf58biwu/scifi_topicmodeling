A breakthrough that will relieve untold suffering on your planet . Our gift to you . This is it . This is the event Donovan 's taking about . T 's too big . Security wi be maximum plus . - There will be a lot of heat . - Nobody said we 'd kick in the door . Are there passes for the center ? There are special passes issued at the last moment . - How special ? - Can you get one ? Don 't think so . I have limited access at Security Headquarters and Steven said that passes will be impossible to duplicate . Anything can be duplicated . If we can expose their Supreme Commander on national TV ... International . I mean , tear his phony face off right in front of the cameras we could turn this war around for good . - Mark , you 're a cop . - Ex-cop . - Eias , you 're a hood . - Ex-hood .

Then get us uniforms . All right . Know what you 're up against . But can 't jeopardize our movement . I want to help . But ... This could change the entire complexion of the war . What are you planning ? T 's better that you don 't know . Not yet . For your own safety . And for ours . I want my son back , Martin . This way . Kristine . Thank you for coming before your broadcast . I want you to meet your guest . Splendid . Who is it ? A very respected man in your country . And ' m happy to say , a booster for us .

Stop right there ! Hello , Mother . This is a nice photograph for our family album . What are you doing sneaking around here ? 'M warning you ! Won 't shoot it out with you . That 's what ' m doing here . Look at us . This is crazy . Why have you done this to me ? You said it 'd never happen here . Then we woke up to fascism . Those who respect the law are free . Criminas ike you cry " fascist . " You 're as free as your eash . Tug too hard , you ' hang by it . - Good night , Mother . - Don 't test me ! - ' M warning you . - You 'd shoot your own son ? It was my son . How could he ? How could he ? Downstairs ! Search the grounds ! Get him . - Not back ? - No , not yet . You did the right thing . You coudn 't risk the mission . Don 't know how many more decisions I can handle . - Becomes easier . - I doubt that . When I was in Africa , I was armed . A soldier came into my church . There was a family hiding there . Suspected guerrillas , that 's what he said . Guerrias . A 10-year-old boy , a 12-year-old girl and their mother . He was gonna shoot them . I had to decide whether I was gonna let him do that . You killed him ? God forgive me . Right in my own church . Hey , leave a couple ribs intact . I was so worried about you . You were ? How worried ? I was just as worried as I would be if anybody ... You were a bit more concerned about me . You 've got a high opinion of yoursef . 'M beginning to get a high opinion of you . - Congratulations on getting back . - Thanks . - Your mom invited you to dinner ? - She insisted . Is this how your Earth girl makes love ? She was young . I was her first . I think she loves you . Look . The way she looks at you . She beieves everything you 're whispering to her . 'D rather not think about the experience . Why don 't you show me ? Are you serious ? Miss Wash ? Here 's a message for you . You . You used to call me Mike . I wondered why your stepfather wanted to see me . That was a dirty trick . - You woudn 't come if ' d asked . - Sure woudn 't have . They want you dead . They ' ki you . You worried for me or for yourself ? - What do you want , Mike ? - They took my son . I want him back . - Sean ? - They took him and the whole town . - Are they dead ? - Not quite . - They 're packed aboard your ship . - What do you mean ? People , packed in cocoons for shipping . In a state near death , like suspended animation . - What for ? - Food . No . T 's true . That 's why they increased our rations . They 're fattening us up . I want you to take this and find Sean . He 's in something caed Section 34 . Please . ' Do what can . You stay out of sight , 'm not kidding . They ' do anything to get you . - ' Try and get word to you . - Kristine ? This is for you , Mike . Don 't go ooking for an ay . - What are you doing off the trail ? - T 's Donovan ! Laser blast below . Two mounted guards in pursuit . Now heading for intercept . Damn . You jeopardized everything by acting alone . You trusted a traitor . What do you expect ? They have my boy . I expect you to think of us before yourself ! You risked all of us . You don 't care . That 's not true . You don 't understand . It has nothing to do with you . Mike , we need you . I need you . But unless you give us your best , you should go before you hurt us . Flight crews , prepare for incoming cargo ships . Downloading in Bay 7 . Tanker approaching departure area . Sean . Just a minute . What are you doing here ? 'M ost . A right . Let 's try it one more time . - Why were you in a restricted area ? - I told you , I was lost . - What 's going on ? - She was outside the special section . - There must be an explanation . - She has yet to give a satisfactory one . Take her into my lab . - Don 't know what you 're potting ... - Don 't speak to me ike that . - I am chief of security . - You 're trying to discredit me . She 's your recruit , your associate , your friend . I have no friends among humans . If she betrays us , your judgment must be questioned . - ' Speak to her mysef . - Why not leave it to me ? - My men are expert interrogators . - Said ' hande it . Very well . But from now on ' be keeping an eye on her . Leave us . You 've paced me in an awkward position . 'D never do anything to put you in a bad light . I just made a wrong turn . Of course you did . But you must be very careful . I am a woman of some authority , and therefore I have enemies . Enemies who would use anyone or anything to hurt me . - We must not give them any opportunity . - No , of course not . The consequences could be most unfortunate . - Willie . - Harmony ! 'M gad to be ooking at you . Yes . ' m happy to see you too . See , yes . To see you . I waited at our spot , but you never came . They move me . Change hours . I must work . Everything . - They move many of us here . - Why so many ? 'M just a worker . They tell me small . Small ? Little . They tell you little . Same thing on this planet . The ow man 's aways the ast to know . I want to touch you , but ... I know . I want to be with you , Willie . Let 's review it again . We ' have three rings of security at the event . Outside , we ' be protected by the passes . Inside our troops will command the lobby and corridors . Finally , the new security doors make the lobby impenetrable . Lovely plan , even if it is my own . Don 't want you deaing drugs . T 's a dirty war . Dealing opens doors . - ' Ve heard the excuses before . - T 's not an excuse . Anything we do to put lizards and their bootlickers on ice helps . Let 's get on with it . Hello , Mike . I envy you , the riches of your planet . Martin , we 're gonna need your help at the hospital . That pan 's as nuts as sending Kristine to Section 34 . What 's it to you ? Our network is based on the mother ship . Security is too tight now . We ' expose John on nationa TV . You have to keep the broadcast up . You ' never do it . Steven will stop you at the door . - We 've counterfeited the passes . - All right . Say you do get inside , you have no chance against his troops . We ' hande them . This scheme is so reckless . T 's i-conceived . T may be , but it 's our ony chance . Maybe we can wake people up to what 's going on . We don 't have a prayer without your help . Please . All right . Somehow that picture will stay on the air . - There 's just one more thing . - With you there always is . We 're gonna need some hep getting out of there . - I suppose you have a plan for that ? - You bet I have . Don 't be so negative , Martin . You ' give yoursef an ucer . - Sorry . - So am I. - We won 't say of this . - You bet you won 't . - You 're acting ike them . - They killed my wife . - And my partner . - He didn 't . He 's not a fighter ! - What is this ? - He didn 't do anything . - He 's one of them . - He may be , but he saved my life . We need information . ' m gonna get it . Like back at the force ? Ask him questions with your nightstick ? You want him . You have to come through me . We 're not fighting each other . She 's right . We 're the Resistance , not a lynch mob . You 're a bioogist , Robert . You 're dedicated to preserving ife . - All life but this kind . - You wanted a specimen , you got it . Good . Then et 's use him . Mark , bring him in the lab . - Fascinating . - A totally different hemoglobin . - How about platelets ? - Don 't see any . Awful lot of plasma in there . Take a look . Yeah , I see . Hi . Hello . I was just wondering do you know a Visitor youth leader named Brian ? No . I am sorry , I do not . - Are you sure ? - I am sure . When is your baby coming ? Coudn 't hep noticing the patch around your neck . It is nearly all the way around . Now keep your mind on your work , okay ? - Yeah ? - Have they done anything to Willie ? Just some humane blood tests , that 's a . You 're wrong about him . He coud never hurt anybody . He 's nice . You must like reptiles . That 's not true . Don 't think they 're izards . - Didn 't you see Donovan 's tape ? - Saw Kristine Wash 's report . T 's makeup that the terrorists do , like in a movie . - You really believe that ? - Yeah . Come here . I hope you have a strong stomach . What are you doing ? Now ask him about the other lies . Ask him why they 're here . Is it true ? Come on . Tell her . It is true . There . Martin said they were immunized against all diseases . He doesn 't exhibit aergic reactions . - Here , Dad . - Thank you . Julie . You have to get rid of it . What do you mean ? - I want an abortion right now ! - We talked about that ... don 't care ! You have to get rid of it ! You don 't understand ! T 's one of them ! - Robin ! - Watch him ! That doesn 't matter ! I resent your presence . T 's a famiy decision . Stay out ! This is the first mating between our race and an alien species . T 's too important a decision for a 17-year-old and her father . - No one 's gonna experiment on her ! - Take it easy , Robert . There are crucial moral principles at stake ... don 't want it ! T 's not gonna be a baby , it 's gonna be some horribe thing . Are you absolutely sure about that ? Brian 's the ony one I ever slept with . You can 't make her go through this for some ideal . - Abortion is murder . - This is different . - The principe 's the same . - We 've heard this before . Those are old arguments for an old issue . This is entirely new . He 's right . We know so itte . There 's never been a conception like this . An abortion could be dangerous . Don 't care . ' d rather die than have this thing . This baby could be a ray of hope a sign of peace between us . The potential is just too great to be ignored . So are the dangers . We can 't take responsibiity for her , it 's her body . T 's her decision . I want it gone . Sweetheart , this is as uncomfortabe as it 's gonna get . Don 't care how much it hurts . Just get rid of it . Where 's Fred ? Don 't know . We have to start without him . 'M gonna make an incision in your abdomen and send a camera down so can see what ' m doing . Why not do a regular abortion ? T 's a aparoscopy . T 's a new technique and it 's rea safe . T won 't take ong . Besides , you get to see yourself on TV . Okay , doctor , the patient and I are ready whenever you are . Go ahead . Take a look at that . - We ' have to put you out , okay ? - Why , what 's the matter ? - Nothing . - Te me what 's wrong . We 're just gonna sedate you for a itte bit , it 's okay . - That 's right . - T 's okay . Okay . Breathe deeply , Robin . That 's it . 'M seeing ots of strands of wispy fibers . They 're threaded throughout the abdominal cavity . My God , it 's growing through the uterine wall . T 's tapped directy into the bladder and liver . - Where were you ? - They 're doube-checking Ds . How 's the fetus ? See any features ? 'Ve never seen anything ike it . The sac is opaque , gelatinous . Those fibers look like umbilical cords . Hand me the scissors . 'M gonna cut one . Temp 's down 4 degrees , heart rate up 130 . That 's better aready . Okay . We 're gonna try again . She 's sipping again . Body temp down 4 degrees . Normal again . - T ' ki her before we take it out . - Stop it , we 're not doing it . She ' have to carry this baby , and we ' have to delver it . 'M afraid ' m not real good company right now . That bad , huh ? 'M just ... 'm just sick and tired of it . 'M tired of trying to be some kind of guerrilla leader . Guerrilla . What is that ? Trying to pull everybody together . Trying to pass as a doctor , as if know what ' m doing . Can 't hande it . Let someone else do it . You 're the whoe show . There is no one else . She coud 've died , because don 't know ... Everything ? Yes . No one expects you to know everything except you .

 'The year is 1987 'and NASA launches the last of America 's deep-space probes . 'In a freak mishap , Ranger 3 and its pilot , Captain William " Buck " Rogers , 'are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life-support systems 'and returns Buck Rogers to Earth 500 years later . ' Colonel Deering reporting from spaceberg escort . ( Dr Huer ) ' Yes , Colonel ? ' We 're approaching Stargate 9 . Request clearance . Clearance granted . Proceed on established flight vector . - What is that , Dr Huer ? - Ten billion tons of frozen oxygen . Once it 's located on the North Pole , it will melt and help replenish the oxygen-depleted atmosphere . This is the third time we 've handled such a transport - and it still makes me nervous . - Why is that ? The spaceberg is on a precise path towards a window in our atmosphere . It has to hit that window and pass through it exactly as planned . - If it doesn 't ? - Friction will ignite the oxygen . The resulting explosion would scorch a third of Earth 's surface , possibly half . Look at what the Terrans are doing , Pinchas . They have a problem and they do something about it . Whatever the difficulties . But you ... You simply come to me with talk . No action . I 've been working on a solution to our current problem , sir . I 've been in contact with agents on Earth ... More talk ! Meanwhile I have 5,000 miners threatening to leave their posts . Do you know what that means ? We 're not producing enough blazium . I 've got orders backed up and I can 't fill them ! I shall be unable to support my chief operations officer . Just as I can no longer tolerate his incompetence . Do I make myself clear ? Ah ! Anad , you 've come . I grew tired of waiting for your call . - You 've read the list of grievances ? - Shocking . Long hours , low pay . Unhealthy working conditions . Low morale , unrest ... The miners have elected me to represent them . Yes . Under your leadership , they have united for the first time . United we stand until something is done . Something is going to be done . - Why have you summoned them ? - The Omni Guard ? They are the key to our security , Anad . They 've kept the mines open and working . Through cruelty and force ! How untrue . I fear you may have ... hurt their feelings . Take the meddling fool away . Silencing him is only a temporary measure . The miners will soon have another leader . The solution I mentioned earlier , sir ... This is it . A drone ? They 've been failures in the mines . We need something more than artificial intelligence down there . This is a Terran drone , sir . Serial number 22-23-T . Manufactured at the ambuquad facility in New Chicago . So ? What makes 22-23-T so unique , sir , is that its basic programming has been augmented by its owner , a Captain Buck Rogers . Rogers is a Terran from the 20th century . He 's endowed the drone with extraordinary features . Resourcefulness , courage , loyalty . And , even though we know such is impossible , some say imagination . You 're thinking to buy it , break it down , analyse its binary patterning ? Yes , sir . And mass-produce it to serve in the mines . Each unit as an adjunct to a miner , to take over some of the more dangerous procedures . And where is this one-of-a-kind ambuquad to be found right now ? On Earth . In New Chicago . My thought was our morale problem would be ... Ladies ... I have a mission for you . ( Wilma ) Dr Huer , my instruments say that the oxygen mass is maintaining a perfect trajectory . Temperature is holding steady at minus 250 degrees Celsius . Thank you , Colonel . Keep me posted of even the slightest change . - Captain Rogers ? - That 's correct . I 'm Stella Breet , contract administrator for Kerk Belzak on the asteroid Toros . I 'm new around here . What does that mean ? Oh . Well , can I come in and explain ? Sure , come in . Come on . - Looks just like I imagined it would . - Like you imagined ? We compile bio-files of business associates before we meet them . I didn 't know we were associates . We 're not . But we will be . Just exactly who is this ... Kerk Belzak ? Mr Belzak owns a mining , manufacturing and distribution operation with its headquarters on Toros . He 's the sole supplier of an explosive called blazium . Very interesting . I still don 't see where I come into this . A million , in round figures . It 's yours . What have I done to deserve such generosity ? You haven 't done anything . It 's payment for your ambuquad , serial number 22-23-T . - T as in Twiki ? - Yes , Twiki . - I 'm sorry , he 's not for sale . - Oh , I see , you want to negotiate . No , I just don 't want to sell Twiki . It 's just an ambuquad . Twiki 's a little more than that . He 's like a friend . A drone is a drone , Captain . Friends ... Friends are different . One feels affection for friends . One owns a drone . Anything that is owned can be sold . Except for Twiki . It would be like selling family . Why does Belzak want my ambuquad ? He 's one of thousands . I 'm not paid to know why , Captain . Captain Rogers , I need your help . Mr Belzak will be very upset if I come back with nothing . Well , I 'd say anything you want , except Twiki and me . I understand that . I have a friend who runs a biostereometrical facility . Well , I thought ... - Oh , you mean a 3-D photographer ? Could I take pictures of Twiki 's internal circuitry ? It would be something to bring back to Belzak . Yeah , I don 't see any harm in taking pictures of Twiki 's circuitry . Knowing the ham he is , he 'd probably enjoy it . - Ham ? - You 'll see when you meet him . Thank you . This is the address . See you there at nine ? Fine . He wouldn 't sell . But we 've got a date with Captain Rogers . And Twiki . Let 's go . Dr Huer , I see an increasing frequency of ionised particles , rising rapidly . I want a detailed radio scan of Quadrant IV immediately . Yes , Doctor . But Doctor , an ion storm of large enough magnitude could ... I 'm aware of the ramifications , Doctor . Begin gathering data , please . Bidibidi . Where is everybody , Buck ? It 's after hours , Twiki . Everyone 's gone home . Here it is . Hm . Captain Rogers , thank you for bringing the ambuquad . Now , if you 'll just leave it here for a while ... - No way , Stella . - As you wish , Captain . Bidibidi . Hey . Hey ! I 'm private property . You 're trespassing . Ambuquad prepared . Autopilot set at coordinates four-four-six . Remote facility activated . Excellent . I 'll take control . Remain on Earth until the ambuquad is securely on Toros . Bidibidibidi . This wild blue yonder stuff is for the birds ! - Dr Huer , Twiki 's been taken . - What ? Three women . Psychokinetics . I think he was taken to ... I have a report of a non-Terran starfighter being launched . Its digital reference was H-270 , indicating its port of origin is Toros , in the Third Quadrant . An ambuquad is in the cockpit . I 'm going after him . This is Buck Rogers calling H-270 . Do you read ? Bidibidibidi . I thought you 'd deserted me . The ambuquad is being followed , Pinchas . Very closely . It appears the two ships may have rendezvoused . Yes . Well , we 'll take care of that . Are you a sight for sore circuits ! You too , pal . What 's the situation on board ? Bidibidibidi . It 's all remote control , Buck , I can 't do a thing . Buck ? Buck Rogers ? The Terran owner ? All right , Rogers , let 's see how good you are . Bidibidibidi . Buck , that wasn 't me . I know , little buddy . You 've got to get out of that ship fast . - Bidibidibidi . But it 's a long walk home . - Don 't worry , I 'll tractor you in . Here I go . The drone is out of the ship ! Where are you , Buck ? Buck ! Bidibidibidi . Some may like hanging loose , but not this quad . You 're good , whoever you are , but you 're not quite good enough . So long . Starfighter 1314 to Earth Control . Come in , please . 'You 've got New Tulsa Tracking Station . What can we do for you ? ' I 've lost an ambuquad . I will need some help finding him . 'You 've got it , 1314 . ' Make it quick , will you ? There 's a heavy-gravity body nearby . If I don 't pick him up fast he 'll crash into it . Bidibidibidi . Bidibidibidi . Help ! Bidibidibidi . Bidibidibidi . Bidibidibidi . Bidibidi . Hurry , Buck . This is New Tulsa Tracking Station to Starfighter 1314 . ' Go ahead , New Tulsa . 'We have a fix , distance 33,000 Mega-Ks from Alpha Centaura . 'Radius vector 33 degrees left off the elliptical plane , 'elevation 40 degrees north . ' Roger , New Tulsa . I 'm on my way . Bidibidibidi . Hurry , Buck . Bidibidibidi . Bidibidibidi . Bidibidibidi . Thanks , Buck . We 're reporting as per schedule . Did the ambuquad arrive yet ? Hardly . The Terran owner intercepted him and brought him back to Earth . Buck Rogers . That would be consistent with the information in his bio-file . 'What are your orders ? ' If the ambuquad is so important to Buck Rogers , let 's see how important Buck Rogers is ... to Earth . He heads an industrial complex which controls dozens of intergalactic corporations . The base of his power , though , is in the blazium mines on Toros . - What 's so important about blazium ? - Blazium ? Gram for gram , it 's the most powerful explosive ever developed . Mr Belzak has made millions by selling blazium to any and all buyers . - What did he want with Twiki ? - Bidibidibidi . Whatever it is , he can 't have it . Dr Huer , this is Colonel Deering . Do you read ? - ' Do you read ? ' - Yes , Colonel Deering . We have substantial interference . We 're encountering a rather violent storm . The ion count is alarmingly high . Dr Theopolis . The data reflects a mature ion storm sweeping directly across the path of the spaceberg . - Dr Huer . - Yes , Colonel . The spaceberg has moved off its flight path . Yes , that 's confirmed by our observations here as well . Stand by for instructions . Dr Huer , if that spaceberg misses the window ... - What can we do ? - Frankly , Buck , I 'm not sure . We 've moved oxygen in this manner twice before . We knew there was a risk . But it seemed to be outweighed by the urgent need . - I 'm going to help Wilma . - There 's nothing you can do . Tell her I 'm on my way . Captain Rogers ! It 's nice seeing you again . Where exactly am I ? Three minutes out of Stargate 23 . An hour from Toros . At least Belzak is consistent - two kidnappings in a row . - Doesn 't he know how to say " please " ? - Belzak gets what he wants . Everything ? - Why are you doing this ? - There are reasons . Necessities . Hm . In my apartment , you said something about friends and affection . You just throw it out the window ? Just a lot of words ? Perhaps something from the nutrition centre ... Stella , what 's Belzak got on you ? I don 't want to talk about this right now . Is he threatening you ? What 's he holding over you ? Come on , Stella , tell me . It 's not me , it 's my son Lucas . His father was a ... Toros general . One of the chosen class . I was a paranormal with psychokinetic powers . Our marriage and our child were never condoned by the ruling class . When my husband protested , he was executed , as a traitor to his class . He was killed for loving me . The man who signed his death order was Belzak . And , on Toros , the son of a traitor is also condemned to a traitor 's death . Belzak spared him . As civilian head of the Ruling Body , he alone could do so . He allowed me to send Lucas to Remus ll and then he forced me to use my psychokinetic powers for his purposes . If I ever tried to leave him , he 'd have Lucas killed . It doesn 't have to be that way . 'This is Toros Approach Control to Shuttle 9281 . ' We 'll be arriving soon . I hope your stay in Toros will be a pleasant one . 'Repeat , this is Toros Approach Control to Shuttle 9281 . 'You are cleared for re-entry over the outer marker . ' Welcome ... to my little corner of the universe , Captain Rogers . Better put that to music . ( Chuckles ) May I have the current data , Doctor , please ? The current angular displacement of the spaceberg is approximately three degrees from centre . It will miss the atmospheric window by nearly 633 kilometres . Might as well be six metres . Once the explosions begin , the entire spaceberg will disintegrate . 'Ah . Dr Huer , I presume ? ' Yes . And you are ? 'Kerk Belzak , sir . It seems you have a bit of a problem on your hands . ' And no time to talk , so if you don 't mind ... 'But I do , indeed I do . We need to speak . ' - About what ? - ' About your friend and mine . ' Buck ! How did you ... ? How is not important , Doctor . It 's what we do next that interests me . 'I see . What do you want , Belzak ? ' Your Buck Rogers for his drone . An even exchange . Bidibidibidi . Hey ! Belzak , you 're guilty of kidnapping and extortion . How do you expect me to deal with ... ? 'Doc , don 't do anything ! ' Belzak ! Listen to me . My hands are tied . The Directorate strictly forbids responding to such threats . All I can do is turn over the entire matter to the Interstellar Authorities , at once . 'Don 't be a fool , Doctor . 'Send me the ambuquad , or Buck Rogers will suffer the consequences . ' ( Angry sigh ) There 's nothing I can do to help him . Nothing at all . Under the circumstances , I don 't think it necessary to give Colonel Deering the burden of ... knowing . Twiki , where are you going ? - Twiki ? - Bidibidibidi . What about Buck ? Come back here this instant . Twiki ! Bidibidibidi . Buck , here comes the cavalry . Geronimo ! Bidibidibidi . Hang on , Buck . I 'm on my way . I think I 've done you a great service , Captain Rogers . Oh , really ? That oxygen mass transport project was ingenious , daring , and will ultimately prove to be fatal to your Terran brethren . I think they 'll find a way to get it back on course . It 's possible , but not probable . One doesn 't just ... nudge ten billion tons back on course . I should like to convince you that a man of your reputed talents has a place here on Toros . After all , the Terran brethren have abandoned you . Perhaps . I don 't think you need those any more . Unshackle Captain Rogers . Bring him on our morning rounds . Let 's see if we can make him a convert to our cause . This is the very heart of our blazium operation . The raw ore is dissolved in hydrochloric acid , reducing it to a pure crystal form . As an explosive , it has unique properties . Aside from its power , it 's the quickest-burning and the hottest , which makes it particularly useful in the cold of space . It must be difficult storing an explosive like this . Not at all . You 're holding enough blazium to destroy a small moon . With ease . Don 't worry , Captain . Blazium needs a substantial amount of energy to ignite it . Consequently , it 's quite stable . I can see that you are genuinely interested , Captain . - Fascinated . - Good . Very good . I can see a glorious future for you here , Captain . Those mines are nearly a flawless operation , except they depend on men to work them . That 's why I need your ambuquad , with all the 20th-century talents you have imbued him with , combined with your own . I hate to tell you this , Belzac , but Twiki is chronically lazy . Bidibidibidibidi . Whoops ! I guess I blew it , Buck . - What are you doing here ? Dr Huer didn 't ... - Bidibidibidi . - I came on my own . - Prepare the ambuquad for disassembly . Bidibidi . Uh-oh ! Bidibidibidi . Help ! - Hang on , Buck . - Stop him ! He 's only one man . Stop him ! Keep your hands where I can see ' em . - Right , Twiki , let 's go . - Bidibidibidi . You got it , boss . Keep going , Twiki . This is ridiculous . One drone and a Terran have me trapped in my own quarters ! Deploy a squadron of guards in each of the main corridors . I want that ambuquad back in one piece . And I want Rogers , dead or alive ! Pinchas ! Hold it , Twiki . The blazium storage room must be around here . Bidibidibidi . Blazium ? Let 's just get out of here . I think that blazium might just solve our spaceberg crisis . Something Belzak said about its properties . ( Electronic humming ) Bidibidibidi . What 's wrong ? That noise ! It 's going right through my head ! Bidibidibidi . Give me a boost , Buck . Buck ! 'Interloper in Subsection 9 , Corridor 3A , sonic chamber . ' Good ! I 'm sure Captain Rogers is getting an earful . Shall we join him ? Bidibidibidi . Higher , Buck . Bidibidibidi . Let 's move it , Buck . We 've got a plane to catch . They 've escaped . Impossible ! The sonic chamber ... Has absolutely no effect on that drone . Idiot ! Look ! Bidibidibidi . That 's why I let you go first , Buck . Must be some kind of energy field . Solid as a rock . Bidibidibidibidi . Now What , Buck ? Stella can deactivate that thing . Twiki , hide under that catwalk . Hold on to that blazium . I 'll be right back . Spread out . Search the bays . Dr Huer , I don 't think we 're having any effect on the spaceberg . I 'm afraid your analysis is correct , Colonel . As I feared it would be . The window was our only hope . Without it ... Stella , I need your help . ( Voices muttering in distance ) Bidibidibidi . What 's keeping you , Buck ? I can 't do it . If Belzak finds out ... He won 't . Not for a while , and by that time we 'll be long gone . He has agents on Remus ll . He 'll have Lucas killed . I know it . Remus ll is under the Directorate 's jurisdiction . We 'll have Lucas brought to Earth , where Belzac can 't reach him . It 's too late to start over . This is where I belong . Stella , give yourself a chance . Give Lucas a chance . I 'm sorry , I can 't . My planet is in danger of being very badly damaged , perhaps even destroyed . I 've got a chance of saving it . In order to do that , I 've got to get out of here . I can 't , without your help . All right , Buck . I 'll deactivate the energy wall . Welcome , Captain . I see the lovely Stella has found you for us . - Very good work , my dear . - Belzak , I ... - She is very persuasive . - Yes , well ... All good things must come to an end , Captain . Where 's your ambuquad ? I don 't know . I think I left him in the tunnels . I 'm not sure . Such a transparently thin subterfuge , Captain . We 'll find him . Take him away . Hold it ! Really , Captain , don 't you ever know when to cease ? Heads up , Buck . Aargh ! Ugh ! Ugh ! Ugh ! Come on ! Move ! Far enough , Rogers ! The ladies would like your attention , just for a moment . Ladies ... Bidibidibidi . Buck ! I 'm terribly sorry to end our relationship this way , Captain . Stella , don 't do this . - Don 't let Belzak win . - Save your breath , Captain . She hears no one but me . Stella , listen to me ! Continue the mind-meld ! - Stella ! - I want Rogers in that acid ! ( Grunting ) Now ! Stella ! I can help you . Don 't listen ! Your son will die without my help . If I die , your last chance to leave this place dies with me . I ... command you ! One move and he dies . Buck , let 's get out of here . You fools ! The Earth is dying . Don 't you understand ? Stella , you 've condemned your son to death ! 'Your approach to Toros cleared for landing . ' Dr Huer , we 're registering a change in temperature . It 's reaching the outer layers of the atmosphere . It 's beginning to heat . I show a reading minus 243 degrees Celsius and rising . If it reaches 217 degrees , the entire mass will become completely unstable . Beyond that , the ignition of the oxygen is inevitable . Buck Rogers calling Earth Defense Directorate . 'Repeat . Buck Rogers calling Earth Defense Directorate . ' Buck ! What 's happened ? How in the galaxy did you ... ? I 'll fill you in later , Doc . What 's the status on the berg ? We haven 't been able to alter its trajectory . It is one minute and 23 seconds from entering the atmosphere . On the wrong trajectory . Wilma , Dr Huer , I think I can get the berg back on trajectory . - I 'm listening . - Blazium is fast-burning and extremely hot . If we plant it in the right place and detonate it , we 'll ... Shift it and let gravity take over . It sounds reckless , Buck . Captain Rogers ' theory is sound , Doctor . But he cannot guarantee an accurate placement . I 'll just have to eyeball it , Doc . Give me the coordinates . Very well , we have no choice . Doctor , we need volume , mass , distance from Earth , angle . Please , Doctor , I have anticipated the requisites . Those figures are coming through on the C-6000 . Excellent ! Buck , your angular differential is ... three degrees , four minutes and 22 seconds . Now , we must reduce the berg 's mass by 4.0923 . - ' How much blazium do you have ? ' - It 's a two-kilo brick . - Doctor ? - Reduce it by half . - Reduce it by half , Buck . - ' Roger . ' Now , from your angle of approach , lay down the blazium on the following coordinates . 'M-23.11 and D-17.9 . ' - Got it . - And good luck . Wilma , clear everybody from the vicinity of that berg . Hang up there at about 20,000 km . As soon as I lay the blazium down , hit it with a pulsar . And get out of there . I understand , Buck , but what are you going to do ? I 'm going to try to get out of there myself . I 'm getting a reading of minus 225 degrees . We are within 22 seconds of the critical range . - Are you ready ? - Yeah . I think so . Bidibidibidibidi . Play it as it lays , Buck . - I 'm on my way . - Standing by . Pulsars ready . Here we go . Eight ball in a side pocket . - It 's all yours , Wilma . - Got it , Buck . Dr Huer , what 's happening ? Doc ? It 's working . By heavens , it 's working ! It 's bringing this mass back into its proper trajectory . I record a satisfactory entrance through the atmospheric window , Doctor . You 've done it , Buck ! You 've done it ! I don 't know exactly how , but you 've done it , my friend ! I don 't know how you do it , either , but I 'm sure glad you do . Terran ingenuity , I guess . Bidibidibidi . And a little luck . Let 's head for home . It 's official : Kerk Belzak has been overthrown by the miners on Toros . - That 's wonderful . - They 've exiled him to the Sixth Quadrant . You won 't have to worry about him for a long time to come . We 've made contact with our people on Remus ll . Lucas will be arriving on the next shuttle . I 'll never be able to thank you . Especially you , Buck . - All of us owe Buck our thanks . - Let 's not forget Twiki . Bidibidibidi . No big deal , Buck . No big deal ? You let yourself get kidnapped , almost got lost in space , then you went AWOL and almost got dissected by Belzak 's goons , not mention nearly getting me burned to a crisp . Bidibidi . Give me a break , Buck . I 'll give you a break . Two weeks ' hard labour . Bread and water . And a suspended sentence . - Thanks for your help , buddy . - Bidibidibidi . You 're worth it , Buck . I think .

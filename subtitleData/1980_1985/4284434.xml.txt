 Ice ! Dead ahead ! The Titanic 's going to sink ? My , you do have an imagination . Over 1,000 people are going to die . We can stop it . We can make it so it never happened . It 's a terrible tragedy , but it 's going to happen . We can 't change that . I can 't let that happen . I can 't . Iceberg ! Oh , my God ! We 're going to hit ! Collision ! Collision ! BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! ( BOTH GRUNT ) It 's a cinch that you 'd never make an aircraft carrier pilot . Quit complaining , will you ? We hit the deck , didn 't we ? That 's exactly what we did , hit it . Hard . Where are we , anyway ? On a very big boat . ( BEEPING ) In the middle of the Atlantic . April 14 , 1912 . Date ring a bell ? No . ( WOMEN LAUGHING ) Well , wherever we are , this time we 're traveling first class . Come on . Wow ! They sure don 't build them like this anymore . They certainly don 't . Hmm ! Bogg ... I 've got a feeling I 'm going to like this job . Well , hello there . You must be from some uncivilized part of this world . Oh , yeah , sorry . I guess these clothes aren 't exactly proper . They 're perfect . You see , I 've had it up to here with civilization . Suzanne Brandes . Phineas Bogg . Hi . Bogg . Bogg ! Excuse me . It 's my nephew . Look , this is going to take a little research . Why don 't you take a stroll around the deck or something ? I 'll check things out here . Bogg . Titanic ? That 's the big one that went down , huh ? Maybe on another trip ? It sank on its first trip . Right . Listen , Suzanne , why don 't you go to your cabin , get a nice warm coat and meet me up on deck in , say , 20 minutes ? Hmm , I 'm on my way . Okay . Oh , and bring your life preserver . Okay , the first thing we have to do is find out how much time we have . Are you crazy ? We 've got to stop this ship ! Jeffrey , look ... Over 1,000 people are going to die . We can stop it . We can make it so it never happened . That 's not what 's wrong . How can you say that ? I know it 's hard to understand , but sometimes history 's cruel . There 's wars , disasters , injustices , but some of those things , no matter how much you want them not to happen , are supposed to happen . But the Titanic ... It 's a terrible tragedy , but it 's going to happen . It was in my guidebook , you learned it in school , we can 't change that , but we can find out why the Omni 's red . Maybe someone 's on board that isn 't supposed to be . Maybe we can save somebody important before it goes down . No ! We can save them all ! No , we can 't . People are going to lose their families . Their parents . You don 't know what it 's like to lose your mom and your dad . No ! I can 't let that happen . I can 't . Jeff ! I 'm terribly sorry , but steerage class passengers are not permitted on the upper decks . I 'll have someone escort you below . Look , I 'm just going after the boy . I 'll be right back . I 'll get the boy . You 're not going anywhere dressed like that . Now calm down , Mr. Ismay . Why , if he can afford that doodad he 's wearing on his belt , he must be traveling first class . You let him find his boy . I 'm sorry , Mrs. Brown , but as I 've reminded you before , dress codes on the Titanic are unimpeachable . I 'm sure you 'll understand . No point in hitting him . I 've tried . If you 'll excuse me ... What a pain . Who is that guy ? That 's Bruce Ismay . He 's General Director of these floating hotels . Why , you must have met him at the bon voyage party . Actually , I just dropped in at the last minute . Oh , well , then you 're lucky . My name is Molly Brown . Phineas Bogg . Well , it 's a real pleasure to meet somebody who isn 't all stuffy and stuck up . You know , Ismay isn 't stopping me because of any dress code . So why don 't I go find your boy . What did you say his name is ? Jeffrey . I think he was headed for the bridge . Where else ? I 'll bring him back . Molly , you said you 'd seen one of these before ? Seen it ? Haggerty 's had it under the nose of practically everybody on board . Haggerty ? Haggerty . The walrus with the mustache that sold it to you . How much did you pay for that ? I know , I know , I know . It 's rude to ask . But he was asking a pretty penny for a gizmo that don 't even tell the time . What did he tell you that is ? Well , you know , I wanted to talk to him more about that . You know where he is ? Usually he holes up in his room . Let 's see , that 's a deck below this one , room next to mine . I think it 's called the Edinburgh Suite . Right . Thanks . Oh , Phineas ! Phineas . Now , Phineas , I know that you feel real comfortable in these clothes , but these folks , they just don 't understand . So why don 't you put on a coat and a tie ? Let me go ! Come on ! No ! Let me go ! I 'll let you go when we find your father . But I 've got to see the Captain . The Captain 's busy . But it 's a matter of life and death ! Oh , stop it . And don 't you be such a crab , Mr. Ismay . Why , seeing the Captain could be a matter of life and death to a young boy . It would 've been for me when I was his age . It 's really important . I 've really got to see him . You know , I was just thinking how much I 'd like to see that bridge . Well , I 'm sure something could be arranged . Right now , Mr. Ismay . With this boy . It would be my pleasure . Can 't seem to find my way around the ship . Keep ending up in the laundry . There you are ! We must have just missed on deck . Were you corning down here to look for me ? Oh ! Gorgeous ! Actually , I was just heading up this way . You know , let 's just forget the deck . My room 's right down the hall . We could have a little supper . No , no , no , it has to be the deck . With my life preserver ? Oh , yeah . That 's the best part . Oh ! Anything you say . Now , why don 't you go right on up and I 'll be right there . I 'm on my way , sugar . ( MUFFLED SCREAMING ) ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) ( SHUSHING ) Just a moment . Yes ? Who is it ? BOGG : Mr. Haggerty ? Yes , this is Mr. Haggerty . Molly Brown sent me down to talk to you . Brown ? She said you 'd have a device that resembles this one . Please come in . Thanks . Be seated . The Titanic 's going to sink ? My , you do have an imagination . It 's not my imagination . You 're going to hit an iceberg tonight . The closest iceberg is over 250 miles to the north . And even if we did bump into one , the Titanic would hardly go down . Why won 't you listen ? People are going to die . You can stop it . I think that 's quite enough . The boy has seen the Captain . Jeffrey ... No , you 've got to believe me . Come along , young man . Come on , Jeffrey , it 's best . No ! You 're all so stupid . So dumb . MOLLY : Come on , Jeffrey . It 's a dark night . Post extra seamen on watch . It 's odd , Mr. Bogg . Odd ? Yes . That I 've not seen you before . It 's a very large ship . Yes , but not that big . And , quite frankly , I find it extraordinary that two people aboard the Titanic should have such a rare device . Which is why I couldn 't pass up the opportunity to come and see you . I 'd like to buy yours . Start a collection . And how much is it worth to you , Mr. Bogg ? That would depend on its condition . May I see it ? It 's identical to yours . Where 'd you get it ? I was just wondering when you 'd get to that . ( WOMAN MOANING ) Remove the sack . ( MUFFLED SCREAMING ) I assume you know her . If not , get acquainted . You 'll be joining her tonight for a midnight swim . You really believe it 's going to happen , don 't you ? It 's out there . Why won 't they listen ? You know , my daddy used to say to me , " Molly , children ought to be seen , not heard . " My eyes are open , " but my ears are closed . " I guess that has something to do with why I 'm such a noisy person today . You 're Molly Brown . Yep , for better or for worse . The Molly Brown who owned all the silver mines . The Unsinkable Molly Brown ! Unsinkable ? Well , considering the circumstances , I should hope so . Come on , I said we 'd meet your daddy near the salon . ( BELL CLANGING ) Ice ! Dead ahead ! Jeffrey ! Dead ahead ? Huh ? God help us . Hard astarboard ! Oh , my God ! We 're going to hit ! It 's drifting starboard . Hard aport ! Hard over ! Hard over there ! Turn ! Turn ! Splendid evening . Yes , yes , just lovely . Now , Mr. Bogg , your device . I feel that two will bring a fancy price . We 're going to collide ! No ! ( GRUNTS ) Collision ! Collision ! ( CRASHING ) Come on . Come on ! Get after them ! Get after them ! Help me a little bit , will you ? We 're going this way ! I 'm not going to argue with you . I 'm sure it was nothing . Nothing at all to be concerned about . Strike up a tune . Something zippy . Why in all the time zones in all the world do I have to land in one with you in it ? Phineas Bogg , you idiot ! Good to see you , too , Olivia . We 've got to go back . Are you crazy ? Come on ! It 's back there ! So are they , come on . Right there ! The Captain 's on his way up . I want a damage report before he gets here . Forget it ! The ship 's going down ! We 've got to save the people . What 's he doing here ? Get him out ! Jeffrey ... No ! You 've got to get the lifeboats . You 've got to hurry . Jeffrey , you 're not helping . You can let him go . I 'll take it from here . Jeffrey ... Jeffrey , now you listen to me . Now , nothing that you say is going to make them listen . I don 't know how , but you were right about the iceberg and you have certainly got my attention . Now , Jeffrey , if this boat 's going down , there are two things we have got to do . We have got to calmly warn the passengers . And find your father . Right ? ( BAND PLAYING UPBEAT TUNE ) Phineas , we 've gotta go back and get it ! Get what ? The Mona Lisa ! Who ? Stop that man ! Stop that woman ! They robbed me ! Stop that man ! Stop that woman ! ( ALL MURMURING ) ( EXCLAIMS ) I left Bogg in a big salon down here somewhere . We 'll find him all right , honey . The Mona Lisa ! She 's down in Haggerty 's room ? Yes . That 's what 's wrong ! We 've got to go back ! JEFFREY : Bogg ! Jeff ! The boat 's going down ! They wouldn 't listen ! Who 's the kid ? We 're sinking , Phineas . There they are ! Haggerty , what is this all about ? Phineas ! There you are ! Hang on , kid . What in blue blazes ? What is going on here ? Oh , no ! Stop , thief ! Stop ! Stop ! You must get back in your cage . Stop ! Don 't run ! You are sick . Please let me try to help you . ( BARKING ) Don 't be afraid . I 'm not going to hurt you . ( PLUMMETING ) ( GROANS ) Sorry if we scared you , it 's just that we ... ( DOG GROWLING ) Uh-oh . Watch it , kid . What in the name of ... What is going on here ? ( BEEPING ) 1884 , France . We got a red light . Beware , the dog is mad . Well , that must be what 's wrong . Why don 't we catch the dog and get out of here ? Wait a minute , you heard what he said . That 's a mad dog . That 's right , I forgot . You 've always been afraid of dogs . I 'm not afraid of dogs . Bogg . I 'm just cautious . Very cautious . There 's no need to apologize , Phineas . You just stay out of the way and I will take care of this . Please , get out of here . This dog is very dangerous . He has rabies . I can help you get him . No , it is too dangerous . If he bites you , you will have the disease . What is the disturbance ? Careful . The dog . OLIVIA : Come on , boy . Nobody 's going to hurt you . We need a net . Yeah , but we don 't have one . Don 't corner him . Phineas , you 're the wrong person to be giving me advice about dogs . Easy , fellow . Easy , boy . Down ! Down ! Olivia , don 't ! Olivia , stop it ! Here boy ! Leave him alone ! Please , you do not understand how dangerous he is . You will only aggravate him . Olivia , listen to him ! Olivia , I told you not to corner him . Down . Olivia , no ! Look out , kid ! Quickly , put him in the bag . I 'll take that . You and the dog have already caused lots of trouble . This time , I am going to call the doctor . The real doctor . Listen , time is of the essence ! We must treat the boy immediately . I 'll be right here . No , don 't leave me ! Be quiet . Bogg , I want you to take me back . What about Jeffrey ? Well , you can come right back . Besides , I don 't need you now , any more than I did on the ship . Bogg , you had no right to interfere with my assignment ! Now I want you to take me back , right now ! Interfere with your assignment ? Bogg , who is she ? The most stubborn , headstrong , egotistical ... Dunn , Olivia . Voyager , class of ' 97 . A voyager ? How come you never told me about her , Bogg ? I 've been trying to forget I ever knew her . Since when do you want to forget a pretty blonde ? Since I was voted Voyager Most Likely to Succeed . I must get more antiseptic . Now , you are not to move , understand ? Well , you weren 't living up to your title back there . Just what were you doing on the Titanic , anyway ? I was doing my job . Trying to rescue the Mona Lisa . Who 's she ? The Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci . It 's the most famous painting in the world . Oh . Did that go down on the Titanic ? It 's supposed to be in the Louvre in France . Only , I think it was stolen once . By Vincenzo Perugia , an Italian who used to work at the Louvre . He felt that this piece ought to be back in Italy where it was painted . So he stole it and hid it in his basement where he felt it belonged until things calmed down . What does that have to do with the Titanic ? Because those two gents you met on the ship stole it from Vincenzo . And smuggled it on the Titanic ? Yeah , but I got to the dock too late to stop them . So you stow away onboard ship . Well , I had to finish my assignment . And I was doing just fine until you showed up . I knew you resented me , but to sabotage my mission ... Sabotage your mission ? You weren 't doing so hot when I got there , you know . It was a temporary setback ! Being thrown overboard with your hands tied would not have been temporary . I had a plan . They had your Omni . ( EXCLAIMS ) Jeffrey , it doesn 't look too serious . You 'll be okay . The skin is broken . The dog had rabies , didn 't it ? Yes . In here , Doctor ! There ! There 's the boy . He was bitten . So , this is your doing , Pasteur . You may be a hero in Paris where the safety of their wines and milk is more important than the safety of their children , but not here . Take him carefully . We 'll go to my office . You can 't let him take Jeffrey . He 's a doctor . Bogg , if you 'd paid attention in class , you 'd know that this is Dr. Louis Pasteur . He discovered the cure for rabies . Wait ... Wait a minute . No , let him take the boy . He will get plenty of rest at Dr. Bernard 's . But I don 't want to go . Go ahead , don 't worry . I 'll take care of it , I promise . I promise . Dr. Pasteur , you do have a serum ? Yes , I have been working on a treatment for rabies . Then your serum does work ? I have had some success with the animals . But the last animal did not respond to the injections . Perhaps it would be unwise to try it on the boy . Dr. Bernard may be right . I am only a chemist . No , to try it on a child would be too great a risk . Look , wait a minute ... Can 't we ... Can 't we Omni forward a few years , get the serum and come right back ? Olivia , if Pasteur doesn 't have the confidence to perfect that serum , a cure for rabies isn 't going to happen at all . We have a red light here and now . Doctor Pasteur , you 've got to try that serum on Jeffrey . It 'll work , I know it . Besides , it 's his only chance . Perhaps . I have it here . Come on , let 's go get Jeffrey . Not so fast , Olivia . Don 't make me pull rank on you . We 're both voyagers . Oh , no ! PASTEUR : Perhaps this is all for the best . What ? My work on this rabies serum has been cursed with one misadventure after another . I cannot go on . You have to . I must abandon this research before I become the laughingstock of all Paris . I could not live with that . If Jeffrey dies because you were afraid to risk your reputation , how will you live with that ? You are right . I 'm afraid that all my success has made me a coward . Then you 'll test the serum on Jeffrey ? Yes , if I could . Well , can 't you just make more vaccine ? It would take a month to get the equipment from the laboratory in Paris . Well , then we 'll just get it back together and quick . What do you need ? Flasks , a burner ... It took half a year to get that burner from England . Jeffrey doesn 't have six months . Look , the stuff won 't be state of the art , but we 'll make do . Stuff ? Where do you think you 're going ? And you always prided yourself on being able to think on your feet . I 'm going on a scavenger hunt . The only thing that might save me is Dr. Pasteur 's vaccine . Pasteur is not a doctor . Not like you , but he 's a great chemist . His theories are nothing but hypothetical mumbo jumbo . His theories are going to change medicine someday . It took generations for doctors to gain the respect and trust of their patients . And now Pasteur comes up with this hocus-pocus of injecting his people with rabies . ( EXCLAIMS ) But it 's the only thing that might work . No , I can 't allow him to give you this injection of vaccine anymore than I would watch you swallow a whole bottle of poison . Sorry it took so long . Well , what do you have ? Jars , dishes , and a cup . And these will work as flasks , won 't they ? That 's okay . Louis says we got plenty right here . Swell . Yes , Mr. Bogg found some empty wine bottles and had the wonderful sense to break off the tops . Simple , but functional . Also , we managed to assemble another burner . We 've been very busy . I can see that . Let 's get on with mixing up another batch of this vaccine . Hey , wait a minute . You got to sterilize those things . They 're perfectly clean . I washed them with my own two hands . In boiling water ? How am I supposed to stick my hands in boiling water ? Yes , boiling water will kill all the microorganisms . A very bright young lady , indeed . BERNARD : There , now , get some rest . No . No , please , Dr. Bernard . You 're a good doctor , but there are just some things you don 't understand yet . Now save your strength . You 're going to need all of it later , son . No ! No , no ... I 'm not going to sit here and die . I want to go back to Dr. Pasteur 's lab . I want to go back to Bogg . No , back in the bed . Bogg . Let 's get some rest . Sleep . There now . You go to sleep . Bogg . Sleep . Sleep now . Bogg . How much longer is this going to take ? This process cannot be rushed . Yeah , we want it right . Getting the vaccine right isn 't going to help anybody if we don 't get to Jeffrey pretty quick . You don 't have to remind me how much is riding on this . Well , you seem to have forgotten about the Titanic easily enough . I haven 't forgotten anything ! We have got to get back there , Bogg ! There 's nothing we can do till the vaccine 's ready . Why can 't we get Jeffrey and bring him here ? No . We 're going to bring the vaccine to him . But we 're wasting time . We 've got a lot better chance of getting in with a vial than we do of sneaking Jeffrey out . What are you so afraid of ? I 'm not afraid of anything . It 's just a lot better if we wait and go in there together with Dr. Pasteur . Yeah , no one will notice the parade passing through . Please , I cannot concentrate with all this bickering . Sorry . We 're all very concerned about Jeffrey . Yeah . Are you not going after your young lady ? She 's not my young lady . You fight as if she were . ( BELL TOLLING ) Jeffrey ? Jeffrey ? Jeffrey . Bogg . Take me to Bogg . Oh , Jeffrey , I 'm going to take you to him right now . What are you doing here ? It is ready . Great . Olivia ... Olivia ! Where is the young lady ? She must help us to get to the boy . I have a lousy hunch she 's already on her way . Come on . Take her away . I don 't want Pasteur or the man disturbing this child . My men are on guard . No one will get past them . Bogg . Well , I guess we were right . Once you arrived , we knew you two would not be far behind . Now you 'll be spending a few nights in our jail . Good job . You and your stupid heroics might just have cost Jeffrey his life . We must get the serum to the boy . You ever play football ? Football ? Forget it . Just follow my lead . Listen ... Pasteur , I am the boy 's physician , I will not let you do this . Sorry , Doc , but I think we need a second opinion . Go ahead . Don 't be a fool , Pasteur . If the boy dies , you will be disgraced , ruined ! Dr. Bernard , I shall have them all arrested . Do with me what you will . My work is done now . Let us wait and see . You sure you 're strong enough to leave ? Yeah , I feel great . Honest . All right . Thanks for saving Jeffrey 's life . Yeah . I thank you . Without your help , the vaccine might not have had its test . Thank God it did . It seems that I was the fool . I , too , had my doubts . Only this man had faith in the serum . My faith was in you , Dr. Pasteur . We must rebuild your laboratory . Only bigger and better . Please , Dr. Pasteur , let me help you with your work . Yes , yes , that would be fine . ( DINGS ) We got a green light . Great . Now can we get back to the Titanic ? Yep . Where 's Olivia ? She 's out there somewhere . What are you doing sitting out here ? I didn 't ... I didn 't have the guts to face you guys . It 's a green light . OLIVIA : Yeah . No thanks to me . I 'm really sorry , Jeffrey . I 'm okay . Yeah , the kid 's in one piece . Next job , rescue the Mona Lisa off the Titanic . Yeah , and get your Omni and Guidebook back . Yeah , well , let 's get on with it . The sooner we get it done , the sooner I can quit . You can 't quit . First I louse up the Mona Lisa rescue , and then I nearly kill Jeffrey by letting that dog get past me . It wasn 't your fault . You said it , Bogg . Me and my stupid heroics . I am one lousy voyager . I didn 't mean ... No , you were right . I 'm not worthy to carry that Omni . When this is over , I 'm going to walk into Voyager Headquarters and resign . You win , Phineas . You win . Come on . Let 's get out of here . ( BAND PLAYING MOURNFUL ) Come on , let 's find the Mona Lisa . Captain Smith . If only I had listened . ( GUN FIRING ) ( PEOPLE SCREAMING ) Everybody stand back ! Can 't allow any men on this lifeboat . Women and children only ! Save your breath , Murdoch ! The Mona Lisa ! HAGGERTY : I 'm not in the mood for this chivalry nonsense . Come on . Come on ! Come on , we got to help . BOGG : Hey , Haggerty ! Haggerty , stop ! JEFFREY : Bogg ! He 's getting away ! Start up there and work your way forward . I 'll try to flush him toward you . I 'd mess it up , Bogg . I 'd only slow you down . Olivia , all you have to ... Just go without me . Please . I 'll meet you and Jeff at the Louvre tomorrow . I 'm going with you . Forget it . You 're staying here with her . But how will you get there ? Haggerty 's got your Omni . JEFFREY : Bogg ! See you in Paris , kid ! We can 't just leave him here ! The boat 's going down ! Jeffrey ... What kind of voyager are you ? I just can 't . Well , I can . Jeffrey ! SEAMAN : Keep moving , please . Just keep moving . Right down the steps and to your right . Follow the seaman . Right , straight down . No pushing . There 's plenty of room . Ho , ho , ho ! Where are you going ? No , I can 't ! Mrs. Brown ! Isn 't this boy with you ? Jeffrey ! Jeffrey ! Oh , thank God . Bring him down here , sailor , please . No , I can 't . Just be glad you 're not a man , son . No ! No ! Let me go ! ( SINGING NEARER , MY GOD , TO THEE ) Excuse me , ma 'am . Ismay ! The dress codes of the Titanic are unimpeachable , huh ? This hat isn 't you at all . Let me go ! No ! Come on , Jeffrey , there 's nothing you can do back there , Jeffrey . Let me go ! No ! Bogg 's back there . I 've got to go back and help him . Jeffrey , there is nothing you can do back there , honey . Come on , ma 'am , hurry into the boat . Give this to the boy . It belonged to his father . There 's room for just one more . Just one more . Lower away . Bogg ! No ! No ! Bogg ! I got to get back to Bogg . No ! Bogg ! ( SINGING NEARER , MY GOD , TO THEE ) ( PANTING ) Over to the left . There 's one . There ! Hand him your oar . You can 't put anyone else in this boat , it 'll sink . Ismay ! Hand him your oar , or you 're going to trade places . Pull up there , Jeffrey . Where 's the device ? Where is it ? In my right vest pocket . ( SCREAMS ) What the heck do you think you 're doing ? I had him right where I wanted him . Oh , yeah . Yeah , but you had to fly in and play hero again . Why , you ingrate . If it weren 't for me ... If it weren 't for you , I 'd have everything under control . Oh , yeah ? Yeah ! Welcome back . Thanks . Now , where 's the painting ? Over there . Did Haggerty have the Omni ? No , it 's down there . Come on ! Son , in all the excitement I almost forgot . A woman gave me this . Said it was your father 's . Thanks . ( BEEPING ) Come on , Bogg . It 's down there . Bogg , you can 't do that ! Bogg , you can 't . It 's too hot ! And the ocean 's too cold . There 's another man in the water over there . We can 't put anyone else on this boat , it 'll sink . This time the coward 's right . The water is almost over the edge . Pick him up . But they said ... Pick him up . Row over there to the right ! You better be there , Bogg . You better be there . Jeffrey ? Jeffrey ! Give me your hand ! Bogg , we 're going under ! I hope it still works . ( MAN SHOUTING IN FRENCH ) ( BELL TOLLING ) ( SOBBING ) ( LAUGHING ) Hey ! Bonjour , kid . Bogg ! Hey ! I mean ... I thought ... I mean , I saw the ship go down ... Yeah , believe me , it was close . It was close . Did you get the painting ? We got the Mona Lisa , and she 's safely in Vincenzo 's basement . That 's why we 're a little late . Why didn 't you put it back in the museum ? Because the Mona Lisa stays in Vincenzo Perugia 's basement for one more year . At which time he tries to sell it to Italy , is apprehended ... And the painting 's returned to the Louvre . You got it , kid . Boy , that Guidebook sure comes in handy . Yeah . And since Olivia 's going to quit , she won 't mind if we take hers . Who is quitting ? Well , you said before you were going to quit and ... And leave history in the hands of guys like you ? What 's the matter with guys like us ? Nothing . ( OLIVIA MOANING ) Thanks , Phineas . See ya ? Yeah . See ya . Some voyager . ( SIGHS ) Some lady . Come on . JEFFREY ... If you want to learn more about the Titanic or Louis Pasteur , take a voyage down to your public library . It 's all in books ! Done by ( c ) dcd / January 2008

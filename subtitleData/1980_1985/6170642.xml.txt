 John ! John ! John ! Come on , you 're keeping jack waiting . Hello . - This is your day , jack . - You 're the pride of your family . Good luck . Thanks , Will ll . Good day . Good day . Good day . Welcome , jack . It 's a great day . ( SCREECHING ) ( BELL TOLLING ) All right , jack . Why do I have to be capped ? Everyone 's capped when they come of age . But why ? Don 't you want to grow up and leave school to work with your father ? Will , you don 't think they 'd hurt us , surely ? - It 's just that ... I don 't understand . - You will . Now , take this food to the vagrant stone , and be careful , just leave it and come straight back . Hurry up ! You want to be there when jack gets back . I 'll be glad to be a man . Oh , me , too . No more school . You 'll work at the mill , with your father . So will you , if you want . Do you sometimes feel afraid of them ? I mean , when you think ... Think about the day we 'll be capped . - I knew you were scared . - I never said that . Anyway , next year there 'll be you and me and the two girls from the Willow farm . What 's there to be scared about ? It doesn 't scare me . Unless I became a vagrant , like them . Capping works with most people . Over near Willow , a vagrant took a boy away . Who said ? Mrs Downs . She said they trap you and murder you . I don 't believe that . Mr Hopkins says all vagrants are mad . ( CLANGING ) Vagrants are stupid . You 're not allowed past the stone , so you 'd better not try it . Come on , WI ll . Come on , WI ll ! My name is Ozymandias . I 'm king of all this land . Look on me . ( CHUCKLING ) Will . What 's it like ? Hey ! Back later . ( CHILDREN RECITING MULTIPLICATION TABLES ) ALL : Seven fours are 28 . Eight fours are 32 . Nine fours are ... ( TRIPOD SCREECHING ) Children , school is over , but I have something to say I should like you to think about . It is surprising , but no accident , that many of our great celebrations , capping day , which we all enjoyed yesterday , and say , September 's harvest festival , stand so close together in our calendar . For nature and the Tripods are the two essentials for the continuation and well-being of mankind . Nature 's bounty clothes and feeds us . And by their benevolent presence , the Tripods have eliminated the evil and greed of war , and all war 's death , diseases and despair . Consider the unthinkable barbarity of deliberately killing other human beings and how it must have been in the dark days before the Tripods came . For centuries , aggression dominated man 's activities , ruining his every endeavor , and in particular , making impossible any true partnership with nature , such as we now enjoy in our more enlightened times . Hands up , those who are to be capped next year . You will have great understanding . We thank the Tripods . ALL : We thank the Tripods . - Where are you going ? - I 'm going to find jack . Are you alone , Will ? Sure ? - Where were you going to ? - The tomb . - Who else knows about this tomb ? - jack . My friend jack . - Where is he ? - Working . You 're expecting him here ? No . Yesterday was his capping day . - You live in the village ? - Yes . - Where in the village ? - The mill . Will Parker , is it ? How many ... - How do you know ... - How many ? - Mother , father and my cousin . - This cousin ? Henry . You saw him with me . Let me go ! - How did you know my name ? - I 'm a vagrant , Will . You know the stories about vagrants . We 're mad men , aren 't we ? We know things other men don 't . Yesterday your cousin called you Will . And the Parker family have been milling corn here for over a hundred years . Please , will you show me the tomb ? I 'll be late home . I don 't think Will Parker 's the sort of boy who 'd bother too much about that . I don 't usually make mistakes in those I choose . Jack won 't ever come here again . Once that cap goes on , out go other things . What other things ? A sense of wonder , curiosity , feelings of aggression and rebellion . No . Nobody who 's ever been capped by a Tripod would find much of interest here . You don 't like the idea of being capped , Will ? What they did to jack , it 's not right . - Has he complained ? - No , nobody ever complains . I mean , look at Anne Digger . She was a girl at school who painted wonderful pictures , really wonderful . They made me feel ... I don 't know . Now she 's been capped , she never paints . I watched you yesterday at the feast . You were the only one not having a good time . How could you watch me ? Put that end to your eyes , take a look outside . ( GASPING ) Men made these , Will Parker . And cities . Cities over the sea . And flying machines to cross the sea . But you 'll only say I 'm mad . You are mad . But I imagine you and jack must have often wondered what life was like before the Tripods . Perhaps . About a hundred years ago , not long , when the Tripods first appeared , they destroyed whole cities . Millions of people were killed or starved . And those that were left , the Tripods capped . Oh , after a generation or two , matters were very much as they are now . People living quiet lives , free from wars , well looked after by the Tripods . Life is good . We thank the Tripods . But you 're afraid of being capped . But ... How can you fight a Tripod ? By using your wits . How do you know all this , eh ? You 're just a stupid vagrant and everybody knows that ... Oh , the cap 's quite genuine . It came from a dead man . That 's my passport to vagrancy , unlimited travel , searching for boys like you , uncapped , unafraid to ask questions , boys with spirit . And there are more of you than you imagine . Listen , Will Parker . There is no land in this whole world without Tripods . But there is a place where men are free , waiting for sufficient numbers and power to rid the world of Tripods . Can you believe this ? - Where is this place ? - We call it the White Mountain . Will you take me there ? Well , I 've got weeks of work to do yet before I go back to the mountains . Yes . I think you should go . Listen , Will , I do you no favors . This place is a long way from here . Very few complete the journey . Think carefully . ( CHIMING ) I won 't be capped . Obstinacy . Good . I 've always thought courage overrated . Do you know Five Ways on the South Road ? Meet me there tomorrow morning at 5 : 00 . Dawn 's at six . I 'll wait until seven . Keep that as a token of trust . Maybe I won 't come . Then I 'll have lost my watch , wasted my time , and you 'll live a life of growing fear and regret until you 're capped . Look ... I left friends and family , too . But remember , they 're not your friends , your family . They belong to each and every Tripod , as you will surely do if you stay here . Men made these , Will Parker . I 'll wait until seven . - I knew you were up to something . - Keep your voice down . Where are you going ? Nowhere . You 're going to tell me everything or I 'll wake Uncle john . I mean it . The mill room , then . Not here . You can 't believe what a vagrant says . He wasn 't a vagrant , I keep telling you . It was a false cap . I don 't know how , but it was . White Mountains , there 's no such place . I 've told you everything I know . I think there 's a lot you haven 't told me . ( CHIMING ) Men made this , Henry . Men like you and me . It 's man-made , Henry . Henry , listen , I 've got to be somewhere . - Where ? - I 'm not saying , but it 's a good few miles and I haven 't got much time . - You 'll be seen . - Henry , please , I 've got to go . - But why ? - Because I can 't stay here any longer . I 'm not going to let them cap me , Henry . I 'm not afraid of the capping itself , but of what I 'll become once it 's done . It 's wrong , Henry . You 've seen jack since , haven 't you ? WI ll , come on . I 'm old enough to think for myself now . I like that and I want that . There 's a lot of things I want to do and find out about . But in 12 months , it 'll be too late . All I 'll be is a puppet for the Tripods for the rest of my life . - Henry , please , I 've got to go . - All right , but I 'm coming , too . - But you can 't . - Why not ? Well , two 's dangerous . He only asked me . Look , I don 't much like the idea of being capped either , so there 's no reason why I shouldn 't come to these loony mountains of yours . - But we always fight . - We Like fighting . Will , there 's nothing for me here . All right , we don 't see eye to eye . That doesn 't matter . You 're the only friend I 've got . I 'd rather be arguing with you all day on our way to these mountains , - if they exist . - They must do . Did he give you that clock ? To show he trusted me . Better get started , then . I 'll get some more food . Right . Boys ! Boys ! Will ? But why run away , john ? I don 't understand . ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) Come in . Mr Parker . Mrs Parker . Is there any sign of them , jack ? Well , I found a note in a place me and Will used as a den . - We had one , too . - Yes . " I won 't belong to the Tripods . You do and you don 't realise it . " Please don 't come after us . Will and Henry . " We 'll get them back . Don 't worry , Mrs Parker . My dad 's gathering some riders together now . Some stupid notion . Well , it was maybe my capping , you know , that worried them . Why didn 't we hear it ? Come on , Will , let 's go home . I don 't mind a beating . We 'd get more than a beating . We 'd be capped . I 'd rather die than be capped . Anyway , I promised Ozymandias . I said we 'd meet him . He trusted me . Well , what are we going to do ? Can 't be far to Five Ways . Oh , what 's the point ? It must be after seven now . ( CHIMING ) Maybe he 'll have waited for us . ( HORN BLOWING ) WILL : Now . Come on ! - Oh , he 's gone . - I told you he wouldn 't be here . Morning , Will . Good morning , Henry , is it ? Follow me . Your friends are out in force . There 's about a dozen of them covering the area . What are we going to do ? You are going to go on from here and take the road south . - What about you ? - I thought you 'd be coming with us . Well , use your brains , boy . Two lads traveling with a vagrant ? We wouldn 't get past the first village . Anyway , I 've got much more work to do here . I 've got to find more Wills , more Henrys . Now , do you know what this is ? It 's a compass . The needle points north . - We 've got one at school . - And this ? It 's a map . Now , listen . Without this , you are literally lost . See this ? North , east , south , west . Now watch . Put north to north . Now , the map 's ready for use . Here is where we are now . You are heading for Romney , here . I 've marked out the way for you . It 's like looking right down from the sky . Yes . When you get used to the map , you 'll find you can work out distances , too . How far is Romney ? If you keep up a good pace , you should be there in a couple of days . - What 's all this blue ? - The sea . Now , listen . At Romney , look in the harbor for a boat called the Orion . The captain 's name is Curtis . Captain Curtis is paid to look after you . You 'll just have to trust him . He has a false cap like mine , but how he came by it I 'd rather not know . Now , across the sea is a country called France . Different people speaking a different language . How do you mean ? Well , you 'll find out . Curtis will tell you more about France . The line on the map takes you southeast . Follow that line . The villages and towns are marked on it , but avoid them . And you 'll eventually come , after a very hard journey and a lot of luck , to the White Mountains . How will we find the Free Men ? They have many lookouts . They 'll find you . ( HORN SOUNDING ) Will , you take the map . Henry , hide the compass . Now , here 's some money . Curtis will give you French money . Now , we must hurry . Will , my watch , please . What happens if we get caught in France ? You 'll be capped . - So there 's nothing to lose . - No . Will , Henry ... Only one , maybe two out of every 50 boys I send will reach the mountains . How will we know Captain Curtis ? He looks like this . - Dad . - Shh . There 's nobody here . Let 's try the other way . I need to rest . All right . But not here , and not for long . There 's something in there . MR PARKER : Will , Henry , is that you in there ? Come on out , now ! ( SHOUTING ) - Come on ! - No ! - Come on ! - No ! " My name is Ozymandias , King of Kings . " Look on my works , ye mighty , and despair ! " - Oz ! - Get down . He 's dead . It goes on forever . I never thought . I mean , did you have any idea ? We 'll follow the path down . Come on . Captain Curtis might not be around . What will we do then ? If we have to wait until he turns up , we 'll find somewhere to sleep . That might be dangerous . - How far now , do you think ? - Can 't tell . - Are you getting aches in your legs ? - Oh , a bit . What do we do W the Orion 's at sea ? - Find another boat . - Oh , yes . Just walk up to somebody and say , " I 've run away from home " and I want to sail to a place called France . " We 'd be back in Wharton and capped before you could say " jack " . You can let Ozymandias down if you like . I 'm not . Oh , I didn 't mean that . What 's today ? - The date , you mean ? - Yes . July the 9th . It 's my mother 's birthday . Or would have been if she were alive . Perhaps Ozymandias was right , then . About what ? It was something he first said to me when I met him , about our parents not really being ours , not like a real mother and father . Because they belong to the Tripods ? Yes . Well , your parents , mine , aunts , uncles , brothers , sisters . Just everybody who 's been capped . They all belong to the Tripods . - All right , they 're alive , but ... - But perhaps it 's better to be dead ? I know I don 't want to be capped . Not for anything . Anything ? The Tripods killed my parents . Perhaps one day I 'll find a way of getting back at them . To do that , you have to make sure you 're never capped . Wonder what Chimney 's like ? I 'LL bet it 's just a small village Like Wharton . There won 't be many people there or ships . We 'll find the Orion in five minutes at the most . I 'm hungry . It 's too dangerous . Come on . - How will we find Curtis ? - I don 't know . - I 'm starving . - We 've got to find the Orion . Come on . - What 's that over there ? - I don 't know . Let 's go and see . - What is it ? - Camel , son , from Morocco . - What does it do ? - Gives wonderful hair for clothes . You wouldn 't get much hair off of that . People pay a lot of money for animal hair like hers . You mean somebody 's paid for her to be brought here ? Squire , up at the castle . His daughter is getting capped next month . Be a big do , that will . ( INAUDIBLE ) ( PIANO PLAYING INSIDE ) Two pies , please . - What kind ? - Those . You go and find a table , I 'll bring them to you . - I 'd have had that pie cold . - Me , too . - ponderer what France is like . - Big . Very big . Look at the sea , it 's so wide . There 's no sign of the other side . It 's nine , 10 ... 11 times that distance to the White Mountains . - It 'll take us weeks . - Months , more likely . - I never realised . - Nor me . It 's taken us three days to get here . - she 'll never make it . - Why not ? It isn 't a race . It doesn 't really matter how long it takes us . But Ozymandias said nobody speaks English . How will we ask our way or buy anything ? Can 't be that different . Captain Curtis will give us some tips . He must have been there dozens of times . - Do you think he 's taken others like us ? - Bound to have done . Listen , by this time tomorrow we 'll be there . We 'll sleep on the beach and then start walking . A few hours a day . There 's no need to hurry . Any sign of a Tripod , and we 'll hide . Then when it 's safe , we just carry on . I don 't care if it takes the rest of my life . I 'm not going to be capped . - Drink , boys ? - No , thanks . Beer 's good . Build you up , make sailors out of you . Just shout if you change your mind . Sorry , that 's me . - Sorry ! - Oh , see what I mean ? Corning . Just shout . Good-looking boy , aren 't you ? How old are you ? - 16 . - Nearly a man . Oh , you 'll break a lot of hearts before you 're wedded . There 's something different about you , though . Where are you from ? - Sorry ! " Coming ! See you later , jolly-face . Ozymandias said he 'd be sending more boys . We may even meet some on the boat . That 'll be great . The more the merrier . - Let 's make a pact . - What 's that ? It 's an agreement . We have to agree that whatever happens , if one of us gets caught or sick or , well , anything , the other one goes on , alone if necessary , to find the Free Men in the White Mountains , agreed ? - Agreed . - Then it will have been worthwhile . And if we both get caught ? Hey , lads . Hungry but not thirsty , is it ? - Yes . - No . Yes or no , you don 't mind if rejoin you , do you ? George , go and get them a beer each . - No , thanks . - We can pay . Who 's talking of paying ? Friendship tavern , this is . We 'll look after you . - You from these parts ? - Yes . Nick 's the name , by the way . - Lillian . - Henry . Runaways , is it ? You have to get your story straight . Yes , no ? You think this place has never seen runaways before ? I was a runaway myself . Good health , lads . - Do you know a Captain Curtis ? - Howell ? - His boat 's the Orion . - Ellie , now . If you 're on the run and want a boat , you 've come to the right man . We 're a couple of crew light and I can put in a word . We 'll wait for the Orion , thanks . Who 's been telling you about this Captain Curtis , anyway ? On the run , George . Here to be sailors . Well , it 's no joy sailing short-manned , is it ? I 've been telling them strong boys come in handy on our old boat . Somebody 's told them to look out for some Captain Curtis . We 'd better go now . Runaways , Mr Mate . Wanting to go to sea . Well , it 's a lucky day for us all , then . Sit down , boys . Finish your food . We sail on the late tide . Uh , we 've had enough , thanks . You be easy now , boys . Nobody wants trouble . WILL : Now ! Come on ! ( CHUCKLING ) What is it ? The drawing . Give me the drawing . Come on . Captain Curtis . - Captain Curtis ! - Captain Curtis ! - Captain ! - Over here ! - Captain Curtis ! Oh , why you ... - Oh , listen , listen . - Come on , Curtis ! - Captain Curtis ! - Oh , he 's going away ! - Captain Curtis ! Captain Curtis ! Captain ! Hey ! One word , one sound , one movement , and you 'll answer to me . On this boat , you do what I say . Do you understand ? Understand ? - Where are you taking us ? - Good run for a first run , boy . Down to where the sun shines all day . Good long run to Africa . You 'll get to know me better by then . - All well ? - No problem , mister . Landfall within the hour . - hardhat 's that ? - You told me to peel them . I said peel them , boy , not massacre them . You peel them that thick , we should be starved before we get halfway . Do we put in to any ports before we reach Africa ? Now , how do you think we get our supplies and cargo ? With this old tub , we stay as close to the land as we possibly can . Looks like we 're going to land in France first . We 've got to get off this ship . We 'll be lucky to get the chance . It 's not going to be easy . Hey , country boys . You 're wanted below . Here 's the boys , Captain . Captain Curtis . He 's Captain Curtis . We thought ... We thought we were on the wrong ship . I 'm Curtis . You 've got something for me ? Money ? That all ? - Ellie , that 's all we were given . - Get back on deck . But Ozymandias said you 'd give us some French money . On deck , I said . He said you 'd give us some French money . Come on , WI ll . What will we do about food and things ? Don 't question me , boy . What you do when you 're landed is your affair . Do you know the dangers I run every time madmen like you cross over ? And you ask me for money ? Get back on deck , or you 'll never even see France . - It 's not right ! - Lillian . ( TRIPOD SCREECHING ) Tripods , Captain . If they 're at sea , the Black Guards won 't be far behind . Stay here . You understand ? Stay here . - From the French side . - Yeah , traveling fast . Captain ! Follow him in , mister . And get those boys hidden below . Come on , out ! Vagrants . Now , very still and dead quiet , or you 'll answer to me . Now , hide yourselves . Your crew , Captain . Your entire crew , they 're all on deck , yes ? Most . You 're bound for Africa . With 10 landfalls . Of which the first , I see , is in my port . - To unload cargo and vagrants . - Of course . It would be unfortunate to have trouble so early in such a long voyage , Captain . - I want no trouble . - Then do not treat me like a fool . This handful on deck will not sail a ship like this to Africa . And you have no authority to take on crew in any French port . - I have enough . - You speak of authority . I have authority to make a thorough search of this ship , Captain . - A thorough search , yes ? - I want no trouble . My interest is in two runaways , nothing else . We understand each other ? All hands on deck , mister . There are runaways here . It may be these runaways are here against their will . It is not unknown . I ask now that anyone here against his will step forward . There is nothing to fear . No one will be harmed . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) Of course you did not know , Captain . They asked for a berth . I was short-crewed . You are lucky . I came to seek two runaways , two runaways were found . I do not trust you , Captain . I do not want you in my port any longer than necessary . You will discharge your cargo and take on board the supplies for which you are scheduled . If you do not leave the port on the next tide , I shall impound this ship . Good day , Captain . You heard ! - What about the other two ? - Take them below . We 're short-handed now . I don 't want to see them again till we 're clear of port . Get the ship ready for sailing , mister . Then get the vagrants ashore . - She 'll be waiting with fresh supplies . - Aye-aye , Captain . Do you think Curtis is gone ? - Ellie , we 're together , anyway . - So were the other two . What 's the use of all this now ? Everybody 's on deck , yes ? Working . Well , let 's see what there is in here . There must be something . Quick ! - So this is Calais , then ? - Must be . It can 't ... Hey ! ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) Run ! ( SHOUTING IN FRENCH ) Come on ! ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) What 's he saying ? ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) Oh . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) Why are you here ? Your boat has parted . You were on the Orion , yes ? ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) So , not capped ? Runaways from England . You wish to tell me why ? We were frightened of being capped . There is nothing to fear . You will be capped tomorrow . The Tripod is here . It is the law . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) I 'm not without sympathy for courage . In this case it is misguided . Tomorrow you will understand and even thank me . I shall see you again in the morning . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) - I knew we 'd be caught . - We 're not capped yet . - We 've got this far . - What for ? ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) What are those things on his face ? I don 't know . - We could rush him . - The Key 's in the door . There is a guard patrolling all the time . On my face ? In French we call them snuffles . Little moons . My eyes are weak . I made them myself . Eat . How did you learn to talk like us ? I have learn myself , from books and English sailors that come to stay at the inn . That 's where I live . The inn . Drink . You 're ... You 're ... You 're not capped . Capped ? Capped . My calcite ? No . - Nor us . - No ? Why aren 't you capped ? You 're older than us . I have 17 . I 'm an inventor , as you see . When I am capped , I will invent no more . There will be no more mystery . - No more curiousness . - Curiosity . Thank you . Curiosity . How have you managed to escape it ? By pretending how much I wish the capping . And then on the day , I 'm very ill , they think . We 're meant to be capped tomorrow . Yes . Where were you going before you were caught ? We 've heard of a place in the south . There are no cappings there . No Tripods . The Tripods , they go everywhere , I think . Maybe not in the mountains . Yes , there are mountains in the south . I have heard . One could hide there . There are Free Men there . Uncapped men . The White Mountains . - How do you know the way ? - I have a map . We shouldn 't trust him . If we don 't , by this time tomorrow we 'll be capped . This map , it is not correct . This is a place of many Tripods . It would be better to go like this and then like this . Hmm . If ... If you helped us escape , you can come with us . I have already decided . I have waited a long time for somebody like you . French boys would have been better but ... But how can you help us ? I shall return to the inn . That door , I shall leave with no key , but open . - Unlocked ? - Unlocked , yes . This water in the center here is the only way out . It leads through tunnels to the beach . You 'll never get past the guards above , so this is the way you must go . The water is not very deep , but you must keep low because there is always one guard on watch . You will need one of these and these . I shall meet you on the beach . If you are caught , I shall go on alone . So , please , I shall take the map ? You must trust me . - And what 's your name ? - My name ? I am jean-Paul . - Lillian . - Henry . Jean-Paul . - More like Beanpole . - Beanpole ? Ah , for beans , a stick , eh ? Ah , beanpole . Beanpole ? Hey . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) What can you see , Beanpole ? No people and no Tripods . Is there any sign of the White Mountains ? Oh , they 're miles away still . Well , they are too far to see for many days yet , Henry . How many days ? Thirty days , if we are fortunate . Thirty days . I thought we might be halfway . We 're making good progress . Are you going to carry the food today ? All right . Not much of it to carry . Your friend , Ozymandias , his map is not very well made . He was killed helping us escape . The map 's got us this far . The map doesn 't have to work well . It only has to work . Ozymandias , he was very brave . He had a mesh cap taken from a dead man . I think it would be possible , yes . If he hadn 't have found me and Henry , well , we 'd never would have known about the White Mountains , or the Free Men . That is certainly true . My parents were dead when I was an infant . And mine . Henry lived with us at a water mill . There is an uncle which I have , and an aunt . But they gave me to the innkeeper to work . That is why it was me that served you with food in the prison . - And you 're an inventor ? - Yes , that 's right . I observe many things . I observe that air which is hot rises , so I make a big balloon ... - Balloon ? - Of course . With a basket of fire underneath . - What was the balloon made of ? - Oilskin . But it would not rise . It is why I am here with you now . I know when I am captured , it will be the end of inventing . - What else have you invented ? - Oh , many things . I am most interested in the steam that comes from a kettle . - It has power . - Power ? Yes . I just can 't see it . Can you ? Once I made an affair of springs beneath my boots to help me jump better . - Ellie , what happened ? - I broke my leg . ( LAUGHING ) This is the farm of my uncle and aunt . When I was younger , I 'd come here every summer and stay in their house , and help them with their work . I was here two years ago . We laughed very much . We talked of times when my parents were alive . It is too dangerous to talk with them now . I never thought then that I would never be capped . Do you think all schoolchildren get doubts about being capped , Henry ? Maybe , yes . We are lucky , then . We 've been able to do something about it . Are you missing home ? A bit . I wouldn 't go back . I 'm like Beanpole . I can 't really remember a home of my own . I 'm glad we met him . We should go now . That 's our course . - No . - Yes , the map says keep southeast . No , I think we should go more this way . - More east . - But the map definitely says ... Look , Beanpole knows what he 's doing . But why go out of our way ? He knows the country round here . Beanpole , why can 't we just follow the map ? You see this line ? It is the them DE fer . - I do not know your name for it . - hardhat 's the them DE fer ? It is famous . When I am here , my uncle told me of it . I 've always wanted to see the them DE fer . What is it ? It is too hard to say . But you will see . Come on . There are metal lines like these near Wharton . - Where ? - Behind Stone Farm . I never knew what they were for . What are they for , Beanpole ? My uncle told me , a wagon without horses . You 'd need a big kettle to push a wagon . ( WHISTLE BLOWING ) It comes ! It comes ! Come on . ( WHISTLE BLOWING ) You see ? You see ? It goes with steam . A big kettle . ( WHISTLE BLOWING ) ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) We 're miles off our course . Well , it was worth it , for the them DE fer . It was good fun , yes . And it was safe and fast . It doesn 't matter how fast it was , if it 's taken us days out of our way . - Lillian , there is a reason ... - There 'd better be ! What do you mean , there 'd better be ? You sound just like some stupid teacher . Henry ... Will , you trust me , yes ? - All right . - Have patience . You will see . ( TRIPOD SCREECHING ) Are there more Tripods in France than in England , do you think , Will ? I think so . - Henry ? - Mmm . Yes . BEANPOLE : They 're everywhere . WILL : Who gave them the right ? BEANPOLE : They have no right . How many people lived here , do you think ? Thousands ? Hundreds of thousands . Places ! For men to sit . And wheels . So , a carriage of some sort . - There 's nowhere to harness the horses . - Ellie , I expect the shafts rusted away . No , look at them , they 're both the same . No shafts , carriages without horses , I 'm sure . Hey . ( LAUGHING ) ( CLANGING ) What 's that ? An animal ? Cat , perhaps ? I don 't like this place . Hey , candles ! Look ! Pots and pans . Hey , clothes ! Bags ! To put things in . What 's in these bottles , Beanpole ? Wine , but it will be bad , I think . Well , try some , Henry . Ugh ! ( LAUGHING ) What have you got there ? It 's even smaller than Ozymandias 's watch . This bit looks like a strap or a belt or something . Pity it 's broken . Eh , voila ' ! Come on , Henry . These will be useful . How long have we been here ? About two hours . Come on . Why don 't we rest up here for a few days ? No , we must leave the city before dark . But why ? It 's great here , and there 's so much to see . Such a place could be dangerous . We ought to get out of here , by dark you said . Bring the candles and light . Come on , you 've got the candles . I know . WILL : Is it a house ? No . I think it 's a kind of them DE fer . Yes , Henry is correct , I think . Well , where does it go ? Into that tunnel . Men made this . What for ? Hey , what are these ? - Hey , I found something else . - Don 't touch it ! Goose eggs , made of iron . - Now you 've broken it . - Oh , no , I haven 't . Anyway , there 's plenty more . ( co UGH ING ) What happened ? Where 's the candle ? Are you all right , Beanpole ? Yes . I think so . Where are you ? I 'm here . Henry , if you hadn 't thrown it away ... You pulled out this ring ? Maybe they are safe until then . Protect the candle . That way . Well , that was stupid . The cabin will protect us . Oh , Beanpole , please . - These might perhaps be useful . - What use ? They 're dangerous . I shall take two . - I 'm not taking any . - But ... ( THUNDER ROLLING ) - Nobody about . - I think not . Let 's call it a day , then , my feet are killing me . Hey , look ! Oh , beds . That one 's mine . ( LAUGHING ) I think I need a bath . ( HENRY HUMMING ) End of water . We 'll have to leave the city tomorrow . This water seems all right . All right for bathing but not , I think , for drinking . Doesn 't smell too bad . Oh , hurry up , we want a go . Pity there 's no soap . It 's probably around somewhere if you look . Don 't think I 'll bother . Vagrants ! We must find some shelter , Beanpole . We 've got to find some trees . Stop here . - He 's shivering . - We must find a better place . Will ! We 're going to look for somewhere . You 'll be all right . You go that way . We 'll meet back here . We can 't leave him . We must find a better place . All right , but let 's not be too long . Count to 500 , right ? He 'll be safe . - Count to 500 ... - I understand ! - ... and then come back . - I understand . ( THUNDER ROLLING ) Henry ! Henry . Henry . Henry . ( GROWLING ) ( CLEARING THROAT ) ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) The wound heals . It is better not to touch it . - Where am I ? - The Chateau Bordeaux . You are here four days and three nights . - Henry ... - Your friends are well . Henry and jean-Paul . My cousin the Du DE Salazar was hunting for wild boar , but found you instead . You will please drink a little watered wine ? - Howell are you ? - My name is Eloise . It is my father who is the Comte Bordeaux . Drink now , I will help you . Thank you . It is good for me to practice my English . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) - You are better now ? - Yes . I think so . You have been very ill . But the worst is over . Now you must grow strong again , Will . - How do you know my name ? - We know everything . In a fever , it is not possible to control the tongue . You were determined not to speak and said so aloud in English . - You know then . - Look at me , Will . There is no shame . You have been brave . I am the mother of Eloise , la Compressed Marie . How do you do ? ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) Willis our guest , Eloise . With him , we must always speak English , until he has our language as we have his . This is Christopher . He will look after you . Christopher or Eloise have been at your side since you were brought here . - H e Brillo . inconsiderable . - When can I see my friends ? - They are waiting outside . Eloise . I shall return when your friends are gone . - WI LL must rest . - No . - Please ... - I think yes . Eloise and I will return later . - You are hungry ? - Yes . Christopher will bring you food when you wish . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) Beanpole , Henry . Are you all right ? Gave us away . - Hey , you couldn 't help it . - Everything . They think we 're only travelers , Will . But I might have said something about the White Mountains . Then they think it was a bad dream , nothing more . - No , but the Countess said ... - It 's true , Will . They think we 're only Wanderers . What are they going to do with us ? - These are not ordinary people . - I can see that . Ordinary people would send us away or call a Tripod . These think it is good for boys to leave home . Their sons travel far away . Could they help us ? Their customs are different . But still , they are capped . They obey the Tripods . Then you two must get away while you can . I 'll follow when I 'm better . I still remember some of the map . It might be a good idea , Beanpole . I have been talking to some of the boys here . - In five weeks , there is a tournament . - Tournament ? Contests and feasts . In the confusion , we could get away . It 's too much of a risk , staying that long . - You two must decide . - I say we should stay . Will has to get his strength back and you both must learn our language . It will be worth it . And we need a new map , a new compass . All these things we can do here . But staying that long ? Have you got a room like this ? No , we sleep in an ordinary room , with the squires . But it 's very nice . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) Tell him Will 's sick . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) No , English . We speak English . These are visitors . My guests . It is understood . I found them . The matter must be reported . It is the law . I know the law . Oh , this one , he is sick , yes ? It is for you to inform the authorities , Monsieur Le Comte . It is the law . It is not my law . Not law here . I found them on the estate and the law says ... Yes , yes , Monsieur Le Du . But there are other Laws . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) Hospitality . Would you bring to me a sick boy to be frightened ? You exceed custom , Monsieur Le Du , and you shame the hospitality of Chateau Bordeaux . You are better , boy , I hope ? - You are feeding good , yes ? - Yes , sir . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) Well , here you are safe . When the sick one is well , then we shall talk . Now , you may go . - Monsieur Le Comte ... - I regret , young men , that Monsieur Le Du DE Salazar is too hard in his duty . Now , you , to bed . And you two , go everywhere , see everything . Be free . Enjoy yourselves . This is my home . I 'm proud to be of the family Bordeaux . It is very beautiful , mademoiselle . It 's all right . Tell us more about the things you do . Well , there 's so much . After the tournament is the feasting for harvest . Then riding in autumn . The ice cracks under the horses ' feet . Then Christmas and the feast of the 12 days , and singers and actors do storytelling . In spring , there is hunting with hawks . And then , voila ' , it is summer again . I think it is the most beautiful chateau in all France . - Tell me of your home , Henri . - I haven 't got a home . Yes , you have . You live with me . - Ellie , he used to live with me . - Is it a village ? It 's just a small place where nothing happens . There 's a festival once a year for capping and another for harvest time . But there is a chateau , though ? And a duke or a count ? Well , there is a squire , but not like your squires . I mean , he 's old . He 's not like the Count . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) - ( FRENCH ACCENT ) Henri ? - ( ANNOYED ) Henry . I don 't know . It is jean-Paul who speaks the best French . ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) entreat . Ah , the young guests . Come in , come in . Bourbon , Monsieur Le Comte . Very good . Eloise , she is a good teacher , yes ? - J ea n - Pa u L - Bujumbura . - Henri . - Henry . - Guillaume . - No , Will . Guillaume is Will in French . So I will call you Guillaume . - You like my room ? - Yes . - I like your telescope . - Ah ! You know about these things ? A little . It is a fine instrument . You can see a long way with one of these . Astronomy , geography , these are my favourite subjects . - You are interested in them ? - I like to learn , malfeasance . Then I shall teach you , all three of you . - When ? - Every day . You will come here every day and I shall teach you . We also like traveling , malfeasance . In that case , we shall take some wine and you shall tell me how you came to travel here . In the study is everything we need . Maps and compasses . I know the stables , so we can get horses . And nobody ever locks up the kitchen , so we 're all right for food , too . What 's wrong with you ? You 're the one with something wrong . You just shrug and mutter whenever anyone talks to you . The Count tries to be friendly . Eloise , too , and her mother . They don 't care about me . You 're the big favourite now . - I didn 't ask for any of it . - That is true . Just don 't let 's get too cosy . That 's all I say . As soon as you 're fit again , we 'll be on our way . Yes . Well , I 'll see you tomorrow , then . That depends on what your friends have got arranged for you , doesn 't it ? - You 're too cruel to him . - He 's changed . - He 's still not well . - Oh , I know all that . Then perhaps you are changing , too . What has Salazar got against Henry , me and Beanpole ? - Against Henri and jean-Paul , nothing . - Me ? - He is jealous , I think . - What of ? I 've done nothing . There is an arrangement . Go on . He and I are one day to be married . I have respect for Monsieur Le Du , of course . - But you don 't like him ? - It is an arrangement . His family are friends of my family . He sees you spend much time with me and knows I 'm happy . Come on , let 's go down to the river . What are you doing here ? Nothing . The Count 's father drew that . It belongs to a set . Well , if there 's more , he won 't miss this one . - What else have you got ? - Nothing . All right , if that is a special map , show me one he won 't miss . You don 't have to steal anything . I 'll take the blame if he finds out . Does Beanpole know about this ? - You 'd better go . - You 're becoming one of them . They found us , they took us in and feed us . They 're kind . I 'm not going to repay them by stealing their property . - That 's Trouillon . - We know . It is thought he will win the tournament . Who do your lot say is going to win ? - What do you mean , my lot ? - Your chums , the Ricordeaus . They don 't talk about winning much , just about giving everybody a good time when the day comes . I have been thinking . Henry does not share much interest in the lessons of the camp . - He doesn 't try ! - If I wanted to be a schoolkid - I would have stayed at home . - I have a great interest in it , but from now on , I shall stay away , with Henry . Why ? I think you alone will gain a greater confidence with the Count . It will be useful when the time comes . It is true , Will , is it not ? You 've forgotten all about the White Mountains , and why we 're here . Don 't be stupid ! - We must Leave soon . - We 're safe here . Yes , but for how long ? I don 't trust any of them . That Salazar man does not like us . I speak so you understand . Three runaways ? It is your word , yes ? Two of England , I do not ask how you are here in France . It has no importance . jejunum Franglais , who is well past his time for [ a raffle . So , what is there to be done with you ? Nothing is to be done , Lieutenant . These , they are here in my household under the care of my chateau . Au contra / ire , Monsieur Le Comte , with respect . These are under the law of the region . When one finds evades , runaways , they are to be capped as soon as possible . It is the law . You questioned my word , monsieur ? - You doubt my authority ? - But my authority ... Monsieur lieutenant , I know the law . These are guests of my chateau , under my protection . The Du DE Salazar , my man , he found them . It was to here they were brought . I do not know in which fashion you came to hear ... inconsiderable ... - I do not wish to know ! They stay here . They study , they learn , they work . For now , I am responsible for them . Responsible also for their capping , which will be soon , I hope . But of course . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) The talking is finished . This is your wish also ? Monsieur Le Comte . Go now , boys , go . Ah ... Monsieur Le Du DE Salazar will stay . ( ARGUING IN FRENCH ) We must get away soon . It 's too dangerous . - You 're fit enough , aren 't you ? - I think so . We must find the White Mountains before winter sets in . We can trust no one here . We 've found one informer . - There may be many more . - When , then ? - As soon as possible . - The day after tomorrow . I agree . Can you two arrange some food ? - We 've got a plan . - Good . I 'll get us a new map . You 're right . Two days , two days , we 'll be on our way again . Just the three of us . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) There was an argument this morning . My father and the Du DE Salazar . - He 's very angry with him . - About sending for those men ? It worried me also . If my father was not here , if he was away somewhere , you perhaps would have been taken to Grand Ville . Eloise ? - Do you ever think about traveling ? - But why ? I 'm happy here . Wouldn 't you like to travel and see new things ? New places ? Do you say these things to tell me you wish to leave us ? I never want to leave you . Do you think perhaps we are in love ? Close your eyes . ( LAUGHING ) No , no ! ( SCREAMING ) Eloise ! Eloise ! You have done well , Guillaume . You have great courage . You 're a very brave young man . Here . Take this , please . I thought she was dead . We are very fond of you , Guillaume . We liked you very much even before you saved the life of our daughter . And now we can say more . We want you stay here with us . Our own sons are far away now , dukes in their own estates . We wish you for a son . To marry Eloise , when the time is right . But the Du DE Salazar ? It is finished . The arrangement ... He was not worthy . - But I 'm nobody here . - That can be arranged . There will be no difficulty . After the tournament , my husband will give this happy news to our friends and guests . Stay with us , Will . Make our home your home and live as one of us . For the rest of your life , Guillaume . ( PLAYING CLASSICAL PIANO ) You 've never seen a tournament before , Will ? ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) - When will your picture be finished ? - You must ask Monsieur Metternich . Monsieur Metternich ? ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) ELOISE : It depends on how much you disturb him , Will . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) It is plain to see you are recovered from your accident , Eloise . Perhaps a walk in the fresh air will suit you better . ( MEN GRUNTING ) ( SWORDS CLANKING ) - Bravo ! - Bravo ! What does he think he 's playing at ? The harder he digs himself in , the harder it 's gonna be to let go . Henry ? You have never thought perhaps that Will is in love ? In love ? You have eyes . See ? Don 't be silly . The romantic English . He 's the big favourite now , all right . He 's even got one of the Count 's rings . Will saved the life of Eloise . Should the Count not be grateful ? Will , what is it ? My friends , I should talk to them . ( SIGHS ) The Count and the Countess want me to stay here . What did I say ? And you , Will , what do you want ? I might stay , just for a while . You 'll have a good life . - And you 'll be capped . - No . Of course you will . You heard what the Count told the Black Guards . Listen , I won 't be capped . There 's plenty of time . It 's just that ... - Ellie , I haven 't worked it all out yet . - Summer won 't last forever and winter 's going to make hard traveling . - I 'll be on my way by then . - Don 't expect us to wait . I don 't ! - I 'm going to bring Eloise . - What ? I 'm going to talk to her when the time 's right . About the Tripods and being free . I want her to come , too . - It will be difficult . - It 's out of the question . It puts us all in danger . They 'll come looking for her . We are nothing . You , they might decide to let you go , but her ... That 's why you two should get away when you can . Eloise and I will follow . You 're letting everyone down . Ozymandias , the Free Men . We were two out of dozens to Ozymandias . Anyway , he 's dead . As for the Free Men , they don 't even know we exist . You 've changed . You 've really changed . - Things are so different here . - How , Will ? Well , at home , all adults were strangers . All adults were capped . Here , at home , what 's the difference ? I never knew it was possible to be capped and happy . - But they are not free . - WILL : How does it show ? They can do what they like here , isn 't that being free ? It 's that girl . Her name 's Eloise . We 've seen you riding , walking , giggling , holding hands . What 's that to you ? It 's just that we 're not good enough for you now . - All right , if that 's the way you ... - I say she can 't come . Well , I say she is coming . She 's trapped you better than any Tripod . Shut up , Henry . With that silly smile and her dark eyes . I said shut up . - Lillian ! Henry ! - The first stupid girl you meet . ( WILL GRUNTS ) ( METALLIC CLANGING ) There must be no more ! You are foolish . Both of you . You draw attention to us now ? I suppose you 'll run straight to the Count and give us away . What are you doing here ? No , Englishman , I ask what you are doing here at the Chateau Bordeaux ? You should know . You 're the one who found me . I should have left you in the forest . It is said you are simple voyagers , you and your two friends . To where do you travel ? - Nowhere in particular . - To travel nowhere makes no sense . - It 's no concern of yours . - Eloise , she 's my concern . Or so she was until you came . - The Count says ... - The Count is an old fool . Do not think we are all fools here . Do you like maps , Englishman ? - The Count ... - I repeat , can be fooled . Do you work at this to gain his favour ? Or is there another reason ? Maybe you intend to continue your travels to nowhere . It would be best also that you continue them soon . - Howell are you , Englishman ? - You know who I am . I know who you claim to be . You and the other Englishmen . You claimed to cross the sea for France where you claim to have met your French companion . You claimed to have travelled to the place I found you . It is all too simple . It is not possible unless you twist and turn to every village in town . You fear the Black Guards . I saw it in your face . Simple travelers do not show such fear . There are many questions to be answered . - I don 't have to tell you anything . - Then I will tell you . ( WILL SIGHS ) You bring danger here . Danger for who ? For your friends , for Eloise , for you . - I 'm not frightened of you . - No ? We shall see . I also have friends , Englishman . My friends have great anger at the way I am treated . Do not think your future here is certain . A chateau has lonely , quiet corridors . Take care not to walk them alone . Get out . Above all , do not feel certain of Eloise . Benefit from these studies . Leave while you can . There will be no pursuit . If not , accept what you bring upon yourself and on those who you claim to love . Get out . Now ! ( PIANO PLAYING ) - ELOISE : What has happened ? - Nothing . - If I asked you to come away with me ... - Yesterday you talked of this . I know you love your home , I understand . It 's beautiful . And I love it too . Can Salazar do anything to harm you ? - Of course not . - Are you sure ? He would dare nothing to harm anyone in the protection of my father . You must already know this , Will . ( SIGHING ) Yes . Why do you ask ? I just suddenly ... Well , you were to be married . He has no one but himself to blame for what has happened . He is of no account . I promise you . It is perhaps your friends who have made you sad . Are they not happy here ? I have many good reasons for staying . One very good reason . But they haven 't . If they go , you perhaps wish also to go with them . - Not without you . - It is not possible . But if there was a good reason for going ? A good reason . A reason of honour . Why is Christopher outside my door ? You 're important now . We are all guarded at night . Who against ? It is the custom for those who are to marry , Will . Tell me more of these honourable reasons . I can 't . Not yet . ( PLAYING SINGLE KEYS ) Henry and Beanpole , can we make them feel more welcome ? They 're already welcome . Yes , but I 've got a lovely room , wonderful clothes , a horse ... And you have me , even if the horse comes first . ( SIGHING ) - What do you wish ? - I don 't know . Something to make them feel closer to us . More equal . It is not good for friends to feel different . We think too much of our own good fortune . It has been another hot day . Last year it was very hot . Madame Fistula fainted . ( COUNT LAUGHING ) Do you remember when the school master fainted , Henry ? - No . - Yes , you do . It was a summer when we had a big harvest and everybody had to help . Did you help also , Henri ? Everybody had to , he just told you . WILL : It was good fun . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) Have you drunk champagne ? No , madame . Let us drink , to the tournament . - COUNTESS : The tournament . - ALL : The tournament . And now , the marriage . What marriage ? He has not told you ? Guillaume is to marry Eloise . To Guillaume and Eloise . It must be when they are asleep . I 'll get the food when I 'm cleaning the kitchens . It will be good to be on the way once more . - You think of Will ? - He didn 't dare tell us . It was a surprise , certainly . We 're his friends , or we were . He should have told us . You believe he 'll never get to White Mountains , Henry ? No , he won 't follow . With or without the girl . Anyway , how would he know where to find us ? How would he catch us up ? You blame him too much . We have been safe here . These people are kind . To Will they have shown a great friendship . It is hard for him . - It 's that girl ... - They are in love . It is that . Henry , we are here because we wish to be free . To make a choice , yes ? If Will wishes to be capped , it is his choice . Well , not for me . HENRY " . You 've changed . - I was trying ... - HENRY : You 've changed . - I 'm going to bring Eloise . - It 's that girl . I 'm going to bring Eloise . ( VOICES ECHOING ) ( TRIPOD SCREECHING ) ( GASPS ) We go , Beanpole . Tonight . I think it is best , yes . Maybe they 're less harmful than we think . - They kill men . - You always get accidents . Accidents ? That helps , does it ? Trying to convince yourself ? You saw Paris , what it must 've been like when men lived there . If the Tripods could beat the people who built Paris , well , what 's the point of a few men in some mountains hundreds of kilometres away , kidding themselves they 're free ? Anyway , we 're going tonight . We need a map and a compass . - Are you listening , Will ? - You 'll have them . You have thought well on this subject ? You still mean to follow us with Eloise ? Yes . You haven 't thought it out at all . You 're fooling yourself . You 'll stay and be capped and probably give us all away . It 's time for my lesson . - Remember our map . - You 'll have your map . ( COUNT CHUCKLES ) It 's time for my lesson . Not today , Guillaume . Today I 'm far too busy . The tournament always takes much arranging , but this year a Tripod has arrived . So this year the tournament will be something special . May I see your father 's maps ? May I copy one for practice ? That 's a good idea . Yes , my father made the maps , I copied them when a boy . Now you . Yes , go to my study , you can work at my desk . Yes , I will . But do not work too hard . Will , I 've come to say goodnight . I 've seen little of you today . Well , urn ... I 've been busy . ELOISE : I also have been busy . And two hours with Monsieur Metternich , the picture is finished . What do you do so late ? Nothing special . You wish to please my father . It is very good . You take much trouble , Will . You will be a great man . We shall be happy together . Now I know why you are so busy today and I love you for it . I bring a gift . It is for you to remember me when we are not together . Do you like it , Will ? - HENRY : WI LL ? - Yes . - Have you got it ? - Here . I thought you weren 't going to steal . I just copied the important parts . - Is it all right ? - It is good , yes . I 've marked a way for you in red . That 's the way Eloise and I will follow . - And what about a compass ? - No . Here 's your chart for the stars . I 've marked out how to find north . Hmm , I understand . Yes , it will do . So long as the stars are out . We know it has not been easy for you , Will . ( WILL SIGHS ) - Good luck , then . - And to you . Good luck , Henry . I 'm sorry if you think that ... That 's all right . - We cannot wait for you , Will . - I know . You could come now . Bye , then . Au revoir . Will . I 've been looking for you . What are you doing ? Thinking . What is wrong ? Nothing . Henri and jean-Paul , they have left ? Yes . I said I 'd tell you everything . And this is the right time because you 've got to understand everything now . Everything 's all right , Will . We 're going to be happy together . You see that out there ? The Tripod , yes ? Do you know what its purpose is ? What it does ? Why there are Tripods all over the world ? In the south , in mountains there , mountains covered in snow and ... You 're capped . You did not know , Will ? You did not know ? I did not think my capping would matter to you , Will . You believe it important ? I thought you would know . I 'm nearly 17 years of age , past capping age . You were telling me of mountains , snow and ice . You should change your clothes now . It will soon be the tournament . Eloise , don 't go . I 've made one decision . Now there 's another . - I do not understand . - I love you . In the full time I 've known you , you 've been capped . It 's a part of you , isn 't it ? I think we can be happy together . ( BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH ) Guillaume . Guillaume , please . We are saying how much we enjoy this day . You also ? It 's wonderful . - Hardhat 's this ? - You must take this , Will . Soon you will have need of it . You must not open it , until the time comes . But how will I know when ? Oh , you will know . Put it safely away . Is it always like this , the contest for your champion ? Today is special . The Tripod makes it so . You are truly happy ? Very haw ' ; - Then the day is perfect . Go to Eloise . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) But I thought we now speak only English . How pleasant to hear even a few words of our native language from your lips . I wish you JOY - M Eric . - What did Salazar want ? - Nothing . He wished us joy . ( GAVEL KNOCKING ) Mesdames et messieurs . Eloise , Guillaume , come . With pleasure , I announce the betrothal of our daughter to this man who saved her life and well deserves her love and our respect . ( ALL CLAPPING ) I have studied the planets and the stars to find the perfect day for their marriage . A man , a woman . English , French . Nobility of nature , nobility of birth . It is the joining of different equals . And they are young , West-re pas ? So , when the year shall be young , and the sun and moon are equal , they shall be married . I announce the day to be the spring equinox of the year to come . Eloise . Guillaume . ( ALL CLAPPING ) ( ORGAN PLAYING ) This is the greatest day of my life . And mine . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) Thank you . Mercia , mercy ' . ( ALL CLAPPING ) Eat , drink ! ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) Eloise . This is the Compte DE Saclay . He taught my father . ( GREETING IN FRENCH ) I have facility of language also , young woman . Even if your honoured father learn little of it in his youth . I salute you both . My congratulations . - Thank you . - Thank you . Your origins , I 'm told , young man , were humble in your native land . I applaud your greater fortunes here . The Compte lives near Paris , Will . Will came here from Paris . Must have been a wonderful city . You 're entirely wrong . History teaches us it was overpopulated , disease-ridden and a center of evil . It dictated the ways of an entire nation . Among the many benefits of the coming of Tripods , the destruction of Paris , and all such cities , is to be greatly applauded . But how can you say that ? I may be humble , but I can see life must have been much easier , more exciting and that ordinary people must have had skills we can 't even dream of . History teaches , and archaeology proves simply that man 's skills , as you call them , were employed entirely in warfare and exploitation , and that the ordinary people , so-called , approved them thoroughly . Of course , I am forgetting that you are ... How shall I put it in English ? Uncapped . Without cap . Capless . When you have received that blessing , I trust you will know better . My wedding gift to you both is that advice . I urge you , sir , to remember it well . Pompous windbag . You should have agreed with him . He knows everything . He thinks he does . ( TRUMPETS BLOWING ) We must take our place . Smile , Will . People are watching us . You must smile . ( SCOFFS ) ( ALL CLAPPING ) ( TRUMPET BLOWING ) Let the tournament begin ! How far have we come ? Fifteen , 20 kilometres . It 's harder without a compass . You are thinking of Will . It is strange to be once more on the way without him . Mmm . I wonder what he 's doing now ? The tournament . Do you think he 'll follow ? He has more to lose than we have . - Eloise . - And other things . He 'll have a good life there . Maybe capping won 't spoil it . - He was right , really . - Oh , how right ? Well , they all seemed happy enough . - He 's in love . - True . Anyway , it is good to be here , and free . And walking to the mountains , yes ? Yes . When he gets ... If he gets capped , will they know about us ? I mean , will they know everything he knows ? Who can tell ? With good fortune , we shall be with the Free Men by that time . Unless he left sooner , and got caught . He 'll be capped sooner then . Henry , do you blame yourself for Will staying ? We grew away from him . In a way , we ... I cut him off . If I 'd have tried harder to understand ... ( BEANPOLE EXCLAIMS ) What has happened is done with , yes ? You must think of now .

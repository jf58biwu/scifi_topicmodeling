 Oh , dear God . Come with me . I think I can help you . I understand your anguish and your dilemma . I have children too . Suppose I guarantee you the camp will not be taken until a certain time . That would enable you to get them out beforehand . You 'd do that ? I would . But if you warn the others , Robln would be quite severely- - No ! No , I won 't . But , can your people take the camp without- - ? Hey ... . It can be done quite easily without harm being brought to anyone . We won 't get there until , what ? Four o 'cIock tomorrow ? Yeah , okay . You have my promise . As a father . I 'll get the maps . Brian ? Just take it easy . It 's okay . It 's okay . - I won 't let anybody hurt you . - I want to go home ! I gotta hand it to you , doc . You really pulled this bunch together . You juiced them up . I 'll tell you something else , though . You better save some for yourself . Thanks . Okay , everybody . One last time . We all know our assignments then . Diversionary actions should start at 1 : 00 . - They 'll know we 're there . - One o 'cIock , then . Followed by our main assault against the armory at 2 . We 've got to remember our prime objective- - To rip off as many weapons as we can get . Right . We have to arm ourselves ... ... so we can protect our equipment when we get it from the camp . Listen , while you 're breaking loose all hell here ... - ... I 'll infiltrate the ship to- - - Find your family ? Hopefully . But also get a handle on their plans . That 's pretty suicidal , isn 't it ? My partner always said I should 've been a kamikaze pilot . He 's still up there . We 'd hate to lose you , Mr. Donovan . I 'd hate to lose me too . Good luck . To all of us . Let 's do it . Wait , Jullet . How about a prayer ? How about it , caleb ? I thought that you would ... . All right . Well , Lord . We really need Your help on this one . please , help each and every one of us to do the best we can . A lot people are depending on us . That 's all . - Amen . - Amen . Amen . Let 's do it . - That 's 1 2 : 30 . - I know it , brother . Hurry up ! I ain 't never messed with stuff like this before . I 'd just as soon not get my hands blowed off , okay ? Now , let 's go set the others . I hate when people do that ! Boy , I 'd like to stick it in their hair ! Hey , hold on . Wait for me ! Willy ! Willy ! All right , right away ! Back onboard , everybody . There 's trouble at the plant ! Come on ! This one 's for Abraham . - Stand back . - Get the extinguisher ! Get some extinguishers ! Isolated incidence of violence mostly explosions at Visitor installations are being reported all across Los Angeles . They may be part of an effort by the scientific conspiracy . Boy , my hands are sweating . Are you scared too ? I hope we don 't have any casualties . I 'd hate to lose one of us . Hang on ! Watch for the snakes on the roof ! Guns and ammunition ! Check it out ! Let 's get it loaded first . Jullet ! I 've got to warn the camp of an attack . - What ? - I tried to protect Robln . - But too many lives are at stake ! - Robert ! - Donovan ! - What 's going on with those tanks ? - You 've been there ? - Yeah . It 's all water . Where 's the chemical ? There 's no chemical . Then what the hell are- - ? Oh , my God . That chemical 's just a smoke screen . - It isn 't what you want at all . - You 're right . You 're here to take the water . It 's the rarest , most valuable commodity you can imagine . Unlike most planets , ours included ... ... Earth is blessed with an abundance of it . We need it , Mike , for our sustenance . To power fusion generators and the leader 's weapons . - We could 've shared it ! - It was proposed . But our leader wants it all . Other ships like this one are already on their way . The plan will take a generation . But he 'll have his way . And the Earth will become a desert ... ... and humanity will die . No . There won 't be any people left by then . There 's something else I have to show you . Look ... ... I 'm sorry about the ... . Where 's Grandpa ? We never saw him . What 's with your arm ? I burned it . What is this ? They 're your people . Dead ? No . Just this side of death . Metabollsm slowed extraordinarily . Diana 's ... work. The people who disappeared . My son . Is he here somewhere ? Or in another ship like this one . Why are they being taken ? Stored like this ? Why not just killed ? The leader needs them living . Some of them will be made into troops for battles with his enemy . - What enemy ? - The force that defeated him before . So that makes them our friends . - I don 't know- - - It 's something to go on . You said some of them would be his troops . Not all ? - No . - What about the others ? In addition to the water ... ... there 's another basic shortage on our planet . Food . How did someone like that get to be your leader anyway ? Charisma . Circumstances , promises . Not enough of us spoke out to question him until it was too late . It happens on your planet , right ? I guess it does . How 's Barbara ? She 's recovering . This won 't be pleasant for you . Are you sure you- - ? Yeah . I 'm sure . Tony . God ... . Diana ? Yes . She 's authorized some ... ... medical experiments . I want to kill her . You 're not alone . Who are you ? A friend . They tried to make me talk . But my grandfather ... ... he fought with Zapata . I tell them nothing . I spit in their faces . Where 's your friend ? There 's a hostage being used to make her father a spy . Here he comes . Get in . I don 't have time to explain . - Let 's go . - You 're coming too ? - I can 't stay here . - You ought to . - But-- - You 'd be more valuable to us here . I 've gotta fly this for you . I 'm a pilot . I 've ridden in enough of them to try . - Listen , Mike- - - Martin . Say it , man . You 're scared . It 's very dangerous for me now . And he looks like a day at disneyland ? Barbara and Tony were scared . We 're all scared . Every damn one of us . But we 've all gotta help out in the best way we can . Now , how about it , man ? Are you game ? It 'll tend to overcompensate . The control 's are very sensitive . But if you let it , Mike , it 'll almost fly itself . I hope so . Hey . I 'm proud to be your friend . I hope we live to be old friends . Hey ! hold it ! Hang on ! Get another fighter and follow me . If they don 't kill us , my driving might . Pull up ! Yeah , I 'm working on it . All right ! Let ' em have it , Cisco ! Sancho . Well done , captain . Their mountain camp . This should give your troops a little exercise . It 's not 4 : 00 ! They lied ! They lied to me ! billy , get over here ! Kathleen ! Polly ! Come on , Sancho ! Nall that sucker ! I will , I will ! But I need a little luck . We 're gonna hit the mountain . Not with any luck . Where 'd you learn how to fly ? Kathleen ! Move back ! Move back ! Bring them over here ! Come on , we 've gotta stop them ! All right , get them out . We gotta save all the equipment in that building , okay ? Let 's go , let 's go ! Hurry up ! Come on ! Yes ! All right ! All right ! Here they come again ! Come on , hurry up ! Julle . Julle ! help me ! Do something . Do something . please ! What should I do ? Another pass . I want to get that woman . - Return to base ! - Right away . All units return to base . Kathy ! Kath . Kathleen . Oh , God ! This wasn 't going to happen . Not to anyone . I tried to fight them . Where are the girls ? Daddy ! Mama ? We fought good , huh ? Yeah . We fought good . Mr. Donovan . It 's good to see you . Yeah . You too . What did you find out ? We did it ! We saved all the equipment ! You see them run ? How about this lady ? Right in the thick of it ! Shoot ! They ain 't so tough ! - Huh ? - They ain 't so tough . Are you crazy ? We 'd better focus on destroying as many motherships as we can . Destroying ? I don 't think you get the picture , doc . There are thousands of people up there . Our people . Yes , I understand . Ellas , get the trucks out ! And we will try to save as many of those people as possible- - - Try ? - Yes , try . Damn it , you 've got to understand . We may have to sacrifice the thousands to save millions , even billions . I don 't like it any more than you do . I hate it . My life has been devoted to saving lives . We may not have a choice . Brad ! help me get the equipment out . Ellas ! Get the other trucks going . Get the ammunition out first . Then the biomedical equipment . Well , it 's not the Hollday Inn but it 'll have to do . You sound like Mom . Guess I 'm gonna have to , huh ? - You still feel sick ? - Not like this morning . Every morning for the past three days in a row . Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . I 'm fine . - Was it scary up on that spaceship ? - Yeah . It was really scary . But it was also very interesting . Okay , everybody , go brush your teeth . You sound like Mom , all right . Oh , really ! That 's the most outrageous story I 've ever heard . Whether you believe it or you don 't ... ... the truth is my son , your grandson ... ... and 1 0,000 others are all prisoners of your " friends . " Don 't tell me you don 't know what went on in this town all week ! Of course I do . I 'm not a fool . - Then why won 't you- - ? - I 'm a survivor , michael . Or I never would have gotten here from that Louisiana hick town ... ... or survived your father 's drunkenness . It 's not the same thing ! I 'm a survivor . If you 're going to be , you better change your ways . I know the Visitors aren 't saints . But they 're in power . They are power . You and I are in unique positions . Don 't you see that ? Why not take advantage of- - I can 't survive at the expense of other people . It 's not right . When I was a kid ... ... there was a woman who taught me what was right ... ... and what was wrong . I wonder whatever became of her . halt ! I said , halt ! - Why have you come here ? - please . - I have to talk to you . - You have to leave ! Our son may be here any minute , understand ? - He 's the one- - - I know . - But the Resistance needs your help . - What ? We want this to be a safe house , where we can hide occasionally . You 're out of your mind ! We 've already been arrested once . Look how he 's suffered . They tortured him . And our son is an informer ! Yes , and all of that is why this is an ideal place . Lightning 's struck here once already . Belleve me , they won 't look here again . We can 't ! They only let us go so that we would warn others of what could happen . - The next time , they might kill us . - They killed Kathleen ! We 've got to stop them . I decided that it would be all right for me to die myself ... ... if millions , millions could be saved ! Oh , please ! My God , we need your help . We can 't . I 'm truly sorry . We can 't . We simply can 't- - What 's this ? My father left it for us . Read it . Read it to him . " My dear family : It 's painful knowing that I 'll not see your faces anymore . But I must take this stand for what I know is right . You may think that an old man wouldn 't be afraid to die ... ... but this old man is very frightened . I 'm hoping that I 'll find a little of your mother 's dignity and strength . So far , I 'm as frightened as a child who fears the dark . But we must fight this darkness that is threatening to engulf us . Each of us must be a ray of hope and do our part ... ... and join with the others till we 've become a blinding light ... ... triumphant over darkness . Until that task is accomplished , life will have no meaning . More than anything , you must remember which side you 're on and fight for it . Your mother and I will march beside you ... ... holding hands again . We 'll sing your song of victory . You 'll feel us in your hearts . Our spirit- - " " Our spirits will be with you always . And our love . " We have to help . Or else we won 't have learned a thing . Okay , Kenny , start it now . So that 's a call for help ? Yep , in mathematical code . If the Visitors have an enemy , they should be smart enough to translate it . How long will it take to reach them ? Depends on how far away they are . - A few years probably . - God , years ? We 're gonna keep on transmitting day and night , right , Kenny ? I hope they got their ghetto blasters tuned in on us . And if they do , let 's hope they 're on our side . So we just hang in there for a couple more years , right ? But the reality we have to face is that help may never come . We may end up having to rely completely on ourselves . We done all right . The first battle 's been won . That 's right . But the war is just beginning .

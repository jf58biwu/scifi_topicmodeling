 Good evening , I 'm Howard K. Smith , and this is the state of the war tonight . Visitor forces cut through the Rio Grande Valley this week ... leaving a path of death and destruction in their wake . The casualty count is still not complete . But unofficial reports have the toll in the thousands . Meanwhile citizens in Brownsville , Texas , aided their own cause ... by raiding the Visitor airfield there ... and destroying 22 alien skyfighters still on the ground . Elsewhere in the former Lone Star State ... Visitors have established processing centers ... in Dallas , El Paso , and San Antonio . In San Antonio , a migrant farm worker Miguel Ramirez ... and a handful of his neighbors barricaded themselves in the Alamo ... and held out for two weeks against overwhelming alien forces . In the end , Ramirez and his valiant followers blew up the national shrine ... rather than allow it to fall into Visitor hands . We are proud to award him ... the Freedom Network medal of valor posthumously . And that 's where we stand tonight . From the Freedom Network and all of us in New York ... our hopes are with you . Good night . Do you see anything ? Wait a minute . Here he comes . The rat 's coming for the cheese . Seal it off . This just became a one-way street . Hey , what do you think you 're doing ? Get out of the way ! What 's going on here ? Come on , we don 't have all day ! Put your hands up ! Hold it right there . - Don 't move . - What you got ? What is it ? Did we get the right lizard ? Yes . It was definitely Diana 's Chief Coordinator for the southwest area . His name was Raoul ... This is bad . Would you like to come over here and share with us what the paper says . Excuse . The conference is set for Playa Del Mar this weekend . The purpose of the meeting is to introduce ... - the encapsulator to all the ... - Encapsulator ? - What 's that ? - I do not know . It says here it will triple the speed of processing ... Humans . Yes . Who 's on the guest list ? All the regional commanders of food processing ... throughout the country . I hope you don 't have plans for the weekend . Not so fast . We lost one man today , I don 't want to lose another . Then you 're in the wrong line of work . Playa Del Mar is only 25 miles up the coast . We can 't let this slip through our fingers . We do it right and they 'll never know what hit them . What do you think ? If we disrupt their processing system by removing the commanders ... we could save millions of lives . Okay . Let 's do it . Good . I 'll arrange a contact with the Resistance in Playa Del Mar. I think her name is Sandi Boddicker . You head up there tonight . I 'll meet you there . - Where are you going ? - Pick up some party favors . I expect the terrorists responsible to be found and dealt with accordingly . The man found this morning was Raoul ... your Chief Food Processor from San Diego . If Raoul was innocent , I 'm Saint Francis of Assisi . It doesn 't matter who the victims were . It was a flagrant violation of our agreement . You promised us safe passage in the Open City . As long as you were unarmed . This was found on Raoul 's driver . I have no intention of quibbling over details , Nathan . Either you enforce the laws of the Open City , or I will . Diana , you leave this city to me . I will maintain law and order , and I will crush the Resistance . But don 't come in here and threaten me . Don 't ever think that I need you more than you need me . The thought never crossed my mind . Good day , Nathan . Mr. Chiang . Yes , Mr. Bates . As of this minute , 9 : 00 curfew is hereby strictly enforced . Also , personal possession of firearms ... - is hereby punishable by death . - Yes , sir . Is there anything else I can do , Mr. Bates ? Yes . I want you to find my son . I want to talk to him now . Mom , why do you always put that on your lips ? To make me look pretty . - You already look pretty . - Thank you . Tell that to him . Here you go . - What 's that ? - It 's a killer burrito . - You want some ? - It looks disgusting . Kyle , your father wishes to see you . Tell him I 'll stop by later . I 'm afraid that will be impossible , Kyle . Hang on ! After him ! Hold your breath ! We got cut off . All right . As I was saying to these officers ... I was just driving along and my car stalled . But I don 't know anything about any Resistance . Thank you , gentlemen . You can leave this misguided soul to me . I don 't know how I got myself into this . Now , you may not want to confess your sins to me ... but I 'm sure Mr. Chiang will make you a true believer . - Whose place is this ? - An old friend of mine . Hey , Mungo ! Guess he 's not home . Maybe we should go . No , it 's okay . He won 't mind if we crash for the night . Besides , I don 't know about you guys , but I 'm exhausted . All I want to do is get some rest . - This isn 't much of a bed . - It 's okay . It 's big enough for two . I 'll take the couch . That 's sort of ridiculous . Why don 't we just go back to your house ? Because my old man just repossessed it . Sorry , but we 're gonna have to lay low until I can find someplace else . Come on , let 's get some sleep . - Where are you going ? - I 'm just gonna turn off the light . Good night . Good night . See you in the morning . There goes the welcome wagon . Pipeline Skate Shop . It 's right there . Let 's go . - Hey , you run the place ? - Yeah . But we 're closing up . Listen , we 're looking for a friend . Her name is Sandi Boddicker . Someone said we could find her here . Do you know her ? Sandi ? She 's not here . Do you know where we can find her ? - Beats me . - Don 't tempt me . Listen , we really need to talk to her . Is there someone that would know ? Sure . Hey , Barry . We got a couple of people here looking for Sandi . He must be in the back . Come on . Hold it right there , lady . Stay where you are . - Who are you guys ? - We 'll ask the questions . How do you know Sandi ? Look , if you just take us to her , we 'll get everything straightened out . Yeah , we probably could ... except for the fact that Sandi 's dead . She was our sister . I 'm really sorry . Yeah , it still doesn 't explain who you are ... or what the hell you 're doing here . Look , we 're with the Resistance in Los Angeles . And I 'd like to believe you , lady . But the only reason my brother and I are still alive ... is that we don 't believe anybody . - Do you get Radio Free America ? - Yeah . It 's almost 10 : 00 now . You ever listened to Skip Henry 's dedication line ? - So ? - Our code name is Romeo and Juliet . Romeo and Juliet ? Let 's hope you don 't end up the same way they did . Turn on the radio . It 's dedication time again . You 're on Radio Free America . Your chance to tell someone out there how much you really care . This tune goes out to Tracy and Todd , Gene and Joan ... The Goose and Mr. D , who want all the peas in the pod to know ... they 're living in the valley of the Jolly Green Giant ... and the boys in the tower who asked me to remind all their guests ... that check out time is 11 : 00 sharp . Well , that 's it for today . Thanks for listening to the old Skipper . And , remember . : If we can 't trust each other , who can we ... I knew it , man , they 're spies . Let 's waste them . - Wait a minute . You 're making a mistake . - No . You made the mistake . This is the Skipper again . I almost forgot . This is a special dedication to Romeo and Juliet . They 're a long way from home and looking for a friend . Welcome to Playa Del Mar. Elizabeth ? There you are . I was getting worried about you . - Are we leaving ? - No . I 'm leaving . Right now the safest place for you guys is here . I got to find out what 's going on . Did you tell my mother ? No , she was still asleep . When will you be back ? Just as soon as I can . Be careful . I will . Didn 't you hear the news ? Big Brother Nathan Bates put us on a dusk to dawn curfew . Nobody 's allowed out after dark . Do you know what that means ? Yeah . - Nobody 'll come to your restaurant . - Where have you been ? Let 's see . Paris , London , Monte Carlo , Burbank . Look , cut the comic , Jack Flash . Your old man 's on the warpath . Tell me about it . I 've been on the run since yesterday . Then you won 't mind taking a little trip ? That all depends on where we 're going . To your old man 's warehouses . For business or pleasure ? His business , my pleasure . I 'm out of explosives . You in or out ? Why not , I owe him one . - Diana ! - Raymond . - You look absolutely wonderful . - Thank you , my dear . - Pardon me . - Who is that chap ? That 's Rodrigo . My personal preparation specialist . He 's arranged quite a feast for us . - This must be the place . - Yup . We got to go around that ravine , get around the house . But we 're still gonna have to take out those guards . We thought something big was going down here . Who are these dudes , anyway ? - You see the guy with the gold chains ? - Yeah . That 's General Maxwell Larson . They call him the Butcher of Birmingham . He 's made Alabama a Visitor smorgasbord . I know , there 's a friendly face . That 's Mary Kruger . They call her the Dark Angel of Dallas . She 's personally responsible for the roundup and processing ... of 50,000 innocent people . According to the WLF ... her appetite is exceeded by that only of her mentor . Who 's her mentor ? There she comes . Miss Diana . The queen lizard herself . What exactly is the game plan here , bud ? We get in . Plant the explosives , and split before the house blows . What more do you want ? Give me a break . Hey , guys . Mike , take a look at that . Not all those people are wearing glasses . - You think they 're humans ? - Yeah . If they are , what the hell are they doing down there ? - Collaborators . - Maybe . Then again , maybe not . Let 's split around the other side of the house and get a look . Barry , come here . Quick . I just saw Sandi . She 's down there . I swear . Look ! By the fence . Let 's go , Dean . Let 's go . What do you mean , man ? Our sister is down there ! We gotta do something ! Look , man , the lizards got her . She 's gone . All that 's left of this family is us . Do you get it ? I know it 's tough to accept , but that 's the way it is . Come on . Come on , Dean , they 're waiting for us . Let 's go . May I have your attention ? Thank you . This is what you 've all been waiting for . The reason , in fact , that I 've brought you here . You 're about to witness ... the state of the art in human processing technology . A system so clean , fast and efficient ... that the results are truly staggering . Mary , show them what I mean . I 've designed this prototype myself . It 's the only one in existence . Assuming it meets with everyone 's approval ... each of you could have one by the end of the year . As you can see , the subject requires very little advance preparation ... and no body partitioning . The need for freeze-drying has been eliminated . The process is simply a matter of pressing the button . - How 'd you find this place , anyway ? - The yellow pages . After you . This is the place your father stores all the goodies he 's confiscated . You take the lower floor . Kid , be careful . The plastique is up here . This place is a gold mine . - Let 's stock up while we got the chance . - Don 't be greedy . I can 't help it . It runs in the family . I 'm sending up a box of grenades . Hey , what are you doing here ? - This area is restricted . - Yeah . Well , see , Nathan Bates ... he 's my dad . Come on . Ham , get out ! Move it ! You okay ? All right , take him alive , he 's Bates ' son . - Move around back . - Careful . This Fisher turned out to be quite a talkative fellow after all . I 'm a very persuasive listener , Mr. Bates . Are you sure he didn 't say anything about someone working within ... Science Frontiers . Unfortunately , Mr. Bates ... he died as we were discussing the matter . Yes ? Are you sure it 's Kyle ? No , you hold him there . I 'm on my way . Mr. Chiang , come with me . I figure they 're mostly up in there . Thanks . Got anything we can put in this ? You mean like milk and sugar ? - Anything . - I wish . Stuff like that 's a luxury around here . It 's perfect . I 'd taste it first . Let 's look at the plans . All right . We go in there . After we take out the first sentry , we got only 60 seconds ... before the second guards arrive . Dean , you 'll put on the sentry 's uniform and take over his post . It sounds real easy . But let me ask a stupid question : How are we supposed to take out the sentry without them hearing us ? - Leave that to us . - Wait a minute , man . So far this is just all talk . Unless you 've got 50 gallons of nitro ... we don 't stand a chance of blowing this place . So why don 't we just admit it ? There ain 't nothing we can do . Is he going to be all right ? Yeah , sure . If we get the explosives for the job . Somebody mentioned explosives ? Allow me to introduce ... Ham Tyler . What are you doing here ? Didn 't you hear about the curfew ? We were careful . Where 's Kyle ? Something 's wrong . I know it . Will you please stop saying that ! He left without saying goodbye . Elizabeth thought he might be coming here . He was here . But he left with Ham . They had a little business up the coast . Yes , they 're playing Del Mar. Playa Del Mar ? That 's a Visitor stronghold . - Look , I think you better sit down . - What 's wrong ? Ham radioed when he arrived in Playa Del Mar. They grabbed Kyle at the munitions warehouse . - We 've got to do something . - No . Wait . - Not until morning . The curfew ... - What if he needs us now ? Look , a cat 's got nine lives . He 's in trouble . I can feel him . He needs our help . Would you just stop ! Tell me the truth , Elias . You really think he is all right ? Look , he 's Nathan Bates ' son . He 's probably having dinner with his old man right now . Really . Dean , come on . Let 's go . I 'll be right there . I 'll get it . Don 't worry about it . - Give it to me . - What 's the big secret ? Look , I 'm really sorry . Why ? You didn 't do anything to her . Listen , I know how you 're feeling . No , you don 't . I 've had a few people that are really close to me die , too . You don 't understand . You see ... the day the Visitors picked up my sister ... I was supposed to meet her , you know ... pick her up after school . And I just forgot . And they swept the area ... ten minutes after I was supposed to be there . Ten minutes . Take the cuffs off of him . Thank you . Isn 't this convenient ? You wanted to see me . Here I am . You know , Kyle ... ever since you 've been a little boy , you 've always had the same problem ... you never knew when it was time to come home . Maybe I never had anything to come home to . You see , you never stop . - Always ungrateful . - Let 's cut right to the bottom line . The bottom line is I intend to maintain the peace in this city ... no matter what the cost . Of course the cheapest way is to wipe out the Resistance . Not the cheapest way . The only way . Good luck . Bad attitude , Kyle . Something you obviously picked up from your friends , Donovan and Tyler . Don 't look so surprised . I resent it when you underestimate me . Now , I want to know the names of the leaders . I want to know the location of the headquarters . I want to know everything you know about that organization . I wouldn 't give you my name . Do you ever stop to consider the consequences of your actions ? Do you ? In case you hadn 't noticed , there 's a war going on out there . As far as you 're concerned ... the war is over . You 're no longer a romantic hero of the Resistance , Kyle . You 're just my son again . No , I 'm not . I never was ! Mr. Chiang , I want you to have a talk with my son . He 's confused . He needs your instruction . Of course , sir . If anything happens , we meet back here . Any questions ? - Yeah . What 's that ? - The key to the front door . You know , I still say it 's like playing water polo ... - with a school of piranha . - Yeah . Let 's go . With this encapsulator , we 'll be processing humans ... at the rate of 100,000 per week ? Yes , but won 't that produce a sharp drop in quality ? A slight drop , Raymond . We mustn 't overlook ... the psychological impact of mass processing on the humans . Once they realize what 's in store for those who oppose us ... I suspect we 'll see an end to their feeble acts of resistance . Have you tried these ? Sweet or sour ? - Try the hot ones . They 're delicious . - All right . Tasty . Help your brother . Go . Hold it . Good luck . Oh , no ! Let 's get going . Move it ! No ! Get in . Move , I say . Inside . Your father has requested that I speak with you , Kyle . He 's very concerned about your well-being , Kyle . That 's a first . Eventually you will come to see the wisdom of your father 's ways ... as a respectful son should . And you 're here to assist in the process . I am here to provide ... an initial lesson in discipline . I was never very much of a student . This is the proper position you must assume ... in order to appreciate your father 's concerns . I would like to propose a toast ... to our illustrious commander . May she continue to lead us to total victory . To total victory . To total victory . Excuse me . I have a slight problem with the first course . She 's a little feisty . The procorb must be wearing off . Perhaps you should give her another injection . No . I found that drugs leave an unpleasant chemical aftertaste . Why don 't you make another selection . I 'm sure there 's an ample supply to choose from . Of course . Excuse me , Diana . There 's a call for you from the Mother Ship . Please excuse me . I 'm sure that this won 't take very long . - Where 's Julie ? - I don 't know . She should 've been the first one here . We 've got exactly eight minutes before this place goes up . Then let 's get a move on . What are we gonna do ? Find her . What are you doing in here ? - You okay ? - Yeah . But they 're not . - The people at the pool . - We got to get them out of there . There 's no time . In four minutes this place is history . I don 't care . I 'm not leaving them in there . Sandi ! Oh , my God ! Get them into the van and go . - What about you guys ? - Get going . - Get all of them ? - Yeah , that 's all . Yes , you have my authorization . Oh , shit ! - Thanks a lot . - Anytime . Sandi , you 're okay . All right , who wants to go first ? They 're coming out of the woodwork . Look over there . - Who goes last ? - You got the cannon . - Cover us . - Good luck . Let 's go , Ham . Come on ! Move in closer . Sure hope they get out . Look . English

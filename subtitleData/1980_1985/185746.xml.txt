Looks like a patrol vessel . Coming onto visual now . - From Auron ? - Yes . One of their C-type patrollers . - Crew ? - Solo . Good . Ideal . Capt. Deral . - Ginka , activate ionic beams . - Activated . - Obtain target coordinates from Control . - Very well , Madam President . - Ionic beams only ? - Just to disable , cause minimum damage . Clinic , bring the disease pathogens in now . I want that pilot alive . Alive and vulnerable . ( DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) Course , Zen . Course 8-2-8-0-4 . Destination is the planet Earth . - Why Earth ? - Why not ? Anywhere else in mind ? The Himalayas are quite tall at this time of the year . Feeling homesick , are you ? As it happens , it 's his idea . There 's someone there he wants to eliminate . - Execute . - What ? One of the Federation 's para-investigators . Notorious thug known as Shrinker . One of his victims was a young woman called Anna Grant . She was important to me . So it 's just revenge you 're after ? Just and sweet . You two , you approve of this ? In the absence of a more pressing engagement . I am not asking them to kill him . But pointless revenge , it doesn 't achieve anything . We 're going home , to Earth . Does it have to matter why ? ( INTENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) ( SUSPENSEFUL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) ( SUSPENSEFUL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC CONTINUES ) Locking arm secured . Good . Bring the pilot straight up . Are you sure we 're totally immune ? I 'd hardly be doing this if we weren 't . The man may suspect . Don 't forget , all the Aurons are telepathic . Not Deral , after being hit by an ionic beam . Let 's hope not . Ah ... pilot Four-Zero . ( COUGHING ) Loss of power . Systems failure . Total cutout . You were hit by a random ionic reef . - Ionic reef ? - Probably a residual from the war . - We ran into it , too . - But with force shields up . - More ? - Thanks . Ginka , how badly damaged is the Auron patrol ship ? Its control systems are burnt out . The auxiliary power unit is functional , but for manual operation only . I 'm continuing with further checks . Manual only , I 'm afraid . - I 'll manage . - With reduced power ? Auron isn 't so far off . Can you supply me with the course coordinates ? Naturally . - I only wish we had time to divert ... - No . Since the war , the Federation breakup , our people are more cautious than ever . - Isolationists . - Very prudent of them . There are so many unscrupulous fortune seekers at large . Checking 's completed . Good . Set course coordinates for Auron . Right away , Madam . Right . I owe you my life . Just be sure and get home safely . ( OMINOUS INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) Since when has a personal vendetta been a good reason for going anywhere ? The trouble with the people of Auron ... is that they suffer from a superiority complex . You should get on well with them then . Too good to become involved with the rest of humanity . That 's not true . Just because we happen to be neutral ... Neutrality or pacifism ... it all boils down to the same gutless inanity . - You 're wrong . - " Gutless inanity " ? I like it . What 's it mean ? Some of us wanted to participate in galactic affairs . - Yes ? - Yes . So what happened ? Were you overruled ? The great passive majority psyched them into line . Telepathic communion is a wonderful thing . - I joined a group of freedom fighters . - On Auron ? No , defending the planet Saurian Major from the Federation . The Federation won , of course . Yes . I do try , though . We 're not all gutless , you see . And the Aurons punished you for your defiance . - Were you exiled ? - Yes . Why do you imagine I 've never gone back ? Affection for him ? ( SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) Auron Control to Pilot Four-Zero . Make contact , please . Auron Control to Pilot Four-Zero . ( BEEPING ) Not receiving you , Four-Zero . Repeat , not receiving you . - Still nothing ? - He 's totally on his own . We have you on visual , Four-Zero , but we are not hearing you . Apply retro thrust . Do you copy ? He 'll burn up if he doesn 't do it soon . C.A. One . Pilot Four-Zero , you must apply retro thrust . Repeat , apply retro thrust . - Do you think he 's slowing ? - Could be . Full retro , Four-Zero . ( LOUD ELECTRONIC NOISE ) Looking good . Reentry terminating . Well done , Four-Zero . Stand by for hookup , stand by . Hookup completed . Very smooth , Retriever 1 . Standing by for docking . Full emergency procedures operative , Retriever 1 . Patar , arrange a debriefing with the pilot , please . C.A. Two , come with me . A signal for you , Four-Zero . Remain in the patroller for priority debriefing ... with C.A. One and the Deputy . Repeat , remain in the patroller ... for priority debriefing with C.A. One and Deputy . Over . They have their priority , all right . Survival . They aren 't all going to die , are they ? Deral , we must rebuild the Federation . - But Auron has always been neutral . - Yes . And so long as it was politically expedient ... they were left to their pathetic little ideals . But the war has left us with a different situation . General disunity and anarchy . So , different imperatives prevail . What about their powers of telepathy ? They 'll have their narrow little minds on other things now . An epidemic of alien pathogens . ( SINISTER INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) Death . Dying . Cally . CALLY ! - What 's wrong with her ? - They 're dying . All dying . Who ? Who is dying ? Here , try her with this . Should snap her out of it . That stuff would snap an asteroid out of orbit . Cally . They 're all dying . Dayna , they 're all dying . Orderlies , here ! Report , Module 6 . It 's here . We 've got it here . Oh , no ! Details . First case was an hour ago . It started with the children . Next , the young adults . Thank you , Module 6 . - Any response to the distress calls ? - Not a whisper . Appeals out on all channels . Nothing . - Medical section reporting . - Yes . Negative trace . Non-bacterial , non-viral . Must conclude disease pathogen of alien origins . Yes . From their insane Intergalactic War . What else ? So why aren 't we affected ? We were exposed to the disease first , longer than anyone . It 's your generation . You still have a resistance to the infection . Unlike the youngsters . ( C.A. ONE SIGHS ) So what do we do ? - Evacuation . - It 's probably Auron 's only chance now . Why aren 't you at the replication plant ? - Off shift , unfortunately . - I 'm sorry . There 's still my assistant , Zelda . Are you all right ? No symptoms ? The plant is fully sterile , sir . Zelda , prepare a full range of genetic stock . Get them packed immediately , ready for evacuation . I have a different priority , sir . - What is it , Zelda ? - To contact Cally . That young rebel . The Liberator must be our best hope . We 've already had distress calls out on constant transmission . Just obey orders . With respect , sir . You and Cally are from the same sibling group , aren 't you ? - Yes , Cally is my twin . - Identical brain scan . Optimum telepathic affinity . - Forget all that and just do as I say ... - Keep trying , Zelda , keep at it . But for you , our people might have had some natural resistance . Your precious dream of isolation . That policy was agreed upon in Council . And those in opposition were simply ignored . My father tried to warn you and so did Cally ... and look how you 've thanked her . She deserved to be exiled . You 'd better just hope Zelda can get her back now . ( ZELDA ) Cally . Help us , Cally . - Help Auron . - Help Auron . Let 's go . - Can we trust them ? - Yes . Zelda would never trick me . - Zelda ? - Her identical sibling . There are plenty more like her on Auron , apparently . - This is not a trap . - Not knowingly , perhaps . - Zen , reroute to planet Auron . - Just like that ? Democracy . You 're outvoted , Avon . 3-to-2 . Four-to-one . I like to stay with the winners whenever possible . Confirm course changing to 0-3 - 1-0 . Destination : The planet Auron . State speed . - Standard by six . - Confirm . I 'm coming , Zelda . I 'm coming home . I 'm coming home . ( OMINOUS INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) Their bio-replication plant . Auron 's most elegant achievement . Synthesised placenta unit . Each capable of gestating a batch of identical siblings . - Of ? - Foetuses , Deral . Offspring . - They look quite human . - They are . The man who perfected the process , Franton ... achieved spontaneous cell differentiation . - No need for fertilisation . - That 's right . - Pure genetic replication . - Your own cells , unmated . - One parent only ? - Exactly . And now , since the untimely destruction of the Clonemasters ... it is exclusive to Auron . Exclusive ? So this is your reason . Nothing to do with rebuilding the Federation . You simply want to reproduce . It 's as well for you ... that just now I happen to need men like you and Ginka ... Loyal , unquestioning ... not prone to interfering in matters of strategy . Even so , it does seem a little excessive ... too afflict the whole planet merely to indulge ... Indulge nothing . This , Deral , is merely a bonus . My primary object for Auron 's affliction , as you call it ... is to seize the Liberator . ( SINISTER INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) - This is crass stupidity . - Not from Cally 's side of the scanner . Emotional ties . We cannot risk the Liberator for sentiment . As long as Cally is part of this crew ... she has full call on your loyalty and support ... no matter what the risks . You forget that the Aurons rejected her . They sent her into exile . You were exiled from Earth . I go back as an executioner . And you really believe revenge should rate a higher priority than mercy ? All right . We will consult Orac . Signal Auron Control . Offer medical facilities . Do we go in and dock ? I give you your orders , Ginka . My apologies , Captain . Do we go in and dock , sir ? - You 'll get your ... - Yes . With full quarantine precautions . Say we 're afraid of cross infection . Under the circumstances , they shouldn 't find that hard to believe . True , Madam . What if the Liberator is out of range of Auron 's distress calls ? You 're forgetting Cally . - Her telepathy ? - Exactly . And I 'm quite sure she 's capable of persuading the others . ( CALLY ) Soon . We 're coming . Tell them they must not despair . The Liberator is on its way . Zelda , we will be together again . Be strong . I 'm coming home , Zelda . I 'm coming to help you . Sir . Your message received , Jig Nine . Hold please . - It 's a reply ? - Requesting quarantine dockings . - Who are they ? - It 's an ex-Federation cruiser . - All right , confirm . - Just a minute . - Suppose it 's a trick . - How ? This whole epidemic . They could have intercepted our ship and infected our pilot . - For what reason ? - Conquest . That 's ridiculous . Surely it would be safer to wait for the Liberator . At least we can trust them . And we know they 're coming , Zelda heard . But not when . Do you know how long it 'll take ? Eh ? Exactly . All right , confirm docking . Full quarantine . Auron Control to Jig Nine . ( TENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) Madam , docking facilities open . - Quarantine ? - As specified . Tell them to have specimens ready for analysis . Right . No . Tell them to have a patient ready . Specify Clinician Franton . Tell them he 's to wear protective suiting to withstand radiation scanning . - Clinician Franton ? - Yes . Their replication expert . ( ORAC ) Reproduction by Clinician Franton 's method of group cloning ... has resulted in highly developed psychic faculties ... telepathy being the most obvious example . These faculties are , of course , limited to the young ... since cloning was developed relatively recently . We know all that . Since I lack sensors to assess what is or is not in your mind ... I cannot assess what is or is not already known to you . Listen , Orac , what about the disease epidemic Cally 's talking about ? It 's a high probability . Because Auron has had a policy of neutrality and isolation ... the planet has now been kept completely free of all disease ... for more than three decades . A sterile environment . Without disease there would be no natural resistance to infection . Precisely . - Checking up ? - Why not ? There 's nothing Orac can tell you that I can 't . Maybe not , but dispassionately , without prejudice or emotion . So what 's Orac 's dispassionate assessment ? A trap ? We haven 't got that far . - Distress signal from Auron . - Details . Signal faint and intermittent . Come on . Requesting urgent help . Requesting medical facilities . Diagnostic scan complete . Remove helmet for treatment . Grasp the support . Keep as still as possible . Feet on the marks . Ginka , that is not Clinician Franton . - It is , sir . - Rubbish . Ginka , who is this woman ? She 's Franton 's daughter ... in charge of the bio-replication plant ... since her father 's death several years ago . Daughter ? Surely the man would have replicated in his own image . It seems she was born while he was still developing the process . Ah ... - Born of natural birth . - Evidently . ( BEEPING ) Excuse me , Madam . ( ELECTRONIC WAVE NOISE ) There 's a mirror to your left . Shall I have her brought in here , Madam ? Please don 't interfere , Deral . I 've already given Ginka his orders . Excuse me , Madam . Control , Liberator is on visual . The prize , Deral . The way to reestablish the Federation more quickly . The single most powerful fighting ship left in space . With that , we can command the loyalty of all factions . Clinician Franton . - No longer infectious . - Total cure . - Your therapy unit , it 's miraculous . - Thank you . Installed shortly before the Intergalactic War . Auron 's people will be saved if we can reprogram our medical units . I only wish that were possible . Explain , Ginka . It 's a pathogen introduced by the aliens during the war . Treatment is linked to the patient 's individual tissue pattern . Individual ? We can offer your people to come on board ... wearing protective clothing in batches of six . Six ? Our entire planet 's infected . If we could at least take the unit out to our medical centre . No question of that . Batches of six , in suits . ( SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) Six at a time . Even if only a few dozen can survive . Where 's Clinician Franton ? She 's gone to the plant to prepare for evacuation of the genetic stock . - Liberator arrival imminent , sir . - At last . Patar , offer immediate docking facilities . I did , sir , but they said they 're using teleport . We 're wasting valuable time . Why don 't we dock now ? Security . But this is a mercy mission , not a war . - Those bugs could hit us , too , you know . - We can dock once we 've assessed . Volunteering for teleport duty up here . We should leave two . Dayna can bring one back up for analysis . Okay . It would be quicker if we took Orac with us . It would be stupid to compound the risk . Risk ? They 're dying down there , dying by the thousand . Orac stays , Cally . Come on . Good luck . - Ginka . - Yes , sir ? - Stand up . - Sir . You are addressing a superior officer . Stand up ! - As you wish , sir . - Yes , Ginka , as I wish . I 'm tired of your insubordination . I 'm tired of your not-very-subtle attempts to undermine my authority . Is this an official reprimand , sir ? If it is , then I have the right to the presence ... of another officer to state my case . What exactly is your case ? Do you mean you don 't know ? Is it because you were passed over for command ? You admit that I was passed over then . Clearly , since I was made captain and you were not . A fact you 'd do well to bear in mind . I do bear it in mind , sir . I bear it in mind all the time . Then act accordingly . Or I shall have you up in front of a court martial . I don 't think the President would go along with that , sir . You think she has some special regard for you , is that it ? I think she recognises a good officer ... even if he doesn 't have the right connections . - As I have ? - Surely . Since you were made captain , and I was not . Get on with your work . ( SOMBRE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) - The first six have arrived , Madam . - Get them out of those suits . Should I proceed with the scanning process first ? There is no point . They have to die anyway . See to it , Ginka , and get two of those suits up here . - Deral and I will need them . - At once , Madam . Control , is the Liberator docking ? No , Madam . It is in stationary orbit . Ah ... Then they 're using teleport . - Is he strong enough , do you think ? - Yes . Come on . Teleport , Vila . So , one of your pilots was infected with an alien pathogen . That 's right . Why didn 't he report , warn you to have quarantine ready ? His communications were defective , auto systems as well . He managed the reentry on manual , but died during docking . - Defective , how ? - Ionic particle dislocation . Didn 't that strike you as odd ? No doubt yet another residue of annihilation from your war . Impossible . No warfare pathogens ... or ionic reefs could have drifted this far . Not so quickly . They evidently have . And our population is decimated . At least Dayna has taken your traffic controller up to our ship . One man . We have to start somewhere . He 'll be scanned for both diagnosis and treatment . And then what ? How many can you possibly save ? - Everyone 's infected . - Including us , by now . What about the genetic tissue ? There are 5,000 on standby for immediate dispatch . - 5,000 ? All uninfected ? - Yes , of course . How can you be sure ? It 's in storage at our bio-replication plant . Is Zelda there ? Yes , with Clinician Franton . ( BUZZING ) There 's someone in decontamination . Carry on , Zelda . Strictly no entry . - Let us in , please . - The infection risk . You obviously have cleansing procedures . - Besides , we 're not diseased in any way . - What do you want ? A small matter of payment , in return for our medical services . I wish to use one of your gestation units . Replication ? That , I believe , is their function . Is it so much to ask ? We 're preparing for evacuation . No longer necessary . Thanks to us . And the Liberator . But the disease pathogens will still be infecting the planet . No problem . After the gestation process is complete ... our medical unit can simply induct specific resistance into the babies . The quicker you oblige , the quicker I can return to my ship ... and allow the treatment to continue . The price of mercy . Elementary commerce . How do you feel ? I just hope Orac can fix it . Liberator . - Idiot , where are you ? - Vila ! ( AVON ) This is not untypical . Vila , come in . - Yes . - Where were you ? Precautions . - Against what ? - Plague . - Has Orac got any results yet ? - No . The first batch are coming back from treatment . Good . Get the next six ready . - Treatment ? - Where ? - From the other ship . - What other ship ? The one that answered our distress call before you arrived . Absolutely still , Tarrant . Bracelets off , and guns , quickly ! Who the hell are you ? I give the orders here ! Not anymore . I 'm in charge . On the floor , double quick ! Zelda . Zelda , listen . We 're trapped in the Control Centre . We 're trapped in the Control Centre . Zelda , prepare a placenta , please . Is that all it takes ? A sample of blood ? It 's the genetic print we need . All body cells with a nucleus carry that . The white cells are here . As long as they 're capable of differentiation ... they 're capable of growth ... into another you . Excellent . - My bloodline , Deral . - Or gene stock . Yes . ( SERVALAN ) Where can I speak to your Control Centre ? Over there . Do you need me , ma 'am ? No , Deral , you can wait for me here . Cally 's trapped in the ... Relax , Vila . Orac 's found the cure . - Quite sure ? - It 's even better than the other ship . - What ? - What other ship ? The ex-Federation that answered our distress call . Now he tells us . Cally , Avon , Tarrant . - Tarrant . Answer , Tarrant . - I 'll go down . And land us into the mess . You stay here until we know the score . - Tarrant . Answer , Tarrant . - What 's going on ? Hello , Vila . ( DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) ( MOUTHS " SERVALAN " ) Time to surrender . We have your compatriots , Vila . Surrender the Liberator and they live . Resist , and they die . However , having some degree of personal regard for you , Vila ... I am prepared to make you an offer . I 'm listening . A position of senior rank . - Such as ? - Say , a governorship ? A planet of your choosing . Earth , if you wish it . - Earth ? - Lies . I think I 'll have a chat with Orac . - We may have one advantage . - Really ? Us . It 's just possible she doesn 't know we 're here . Why ? Why have you done this ? Yes , why ? Why have you brought this on us ? I just can 't believe it . - I can 't believe that anyone can be so ... - Successful ? Well , now you know . Take them out and shoot them . - I 'm sorry . - You 're not to blame . Aren 't I ? I should have listened to Franton after all . You did what you thought was right at the time . Go on , Vila . Orac says to come up here and negotiate . Does it really ? A question of trust . Orac can only assess veracity in person . - I 'll send a deputy . - All right , but unarmed . Let me go , Madam . I 'll take the Liberator . No . I think Deral would be a more suitable representative . Without a weapon ? Have one . But hidden . It 's only Vila up there and he 's a coward . Get control of that teleport , and the Liberator is ours . My deputy is ready . His name is Deral . One moment . - All right . - Teleport . - Welcome aboard . - Sit down . Over here ? - Keep still . - So much for trust . Disarming , isn 't she ? Over there . You tried to trick us , Servalan . Naughty . One hostage to us . And three to me . But listen , I have to go . Set foot outside this building and you 'll be instantly infected . - But not dead . I can still ... - I 'm immune now , Zelda , cured . One of us must stay and complete the packing . The genetic material must be ready for evacuation . It 's Auron 's only chance now . - But ... - I 'll manage . - But I ... - You stay and alert Cally . Tell her to be ready . - Where is Servalan 's ship ? - Down on the quarantine ramps . Threaten it , Vila . You 're cut off , Servalan . We have a neutron blaster sighted on your ship . Destroy it , and you destroy your three compatriots . - They 're not on board . - True , Vila , true . But they are infected with the disease . And the only cure happens to be on my ship . I think it quite safe to return . Ginka , bring the bracelets . Watch them . Is she telling the truth , Deral ? Can she really cure them ? Well ? If I help you , I 'm finished with Servalan . Friend , you 're dead meat to her anyway . Avon , Tarrant , look . ( DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) Nice shot . I 'll take him . I 'm Franton . The guard 's gone . You 'll never get him . - He 'll alert Servalan . - How far is their ship ? - Close . - As soon as she knows , she 'll blast us . - There 's no point in staying here . - Where shall we go ? - There is one place that 's safe . - From those projectiles of hers ? Simply because of what 's in there . The replication plant . Come on . Fool ! Arm projectiles . Prepare to fire . - Target ? - The Control Centre . ( FAST-PACED INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) The Centre . Come on . - The Control Centre ? - Demolished . Good . Our sensors are detecting movement . - Sector ? - Northeast . They 're heading for the replication plant . - Ready to fire . - Wait . Use mark fives only . - But , Madam ... - Ginka , I don 't want that plant damaged . Not much further . Hurry ! Projectile attack in proximity of main Control Centre . They stand about as much chance as a bubble in a black hole . Unless they head for the replication plant . What ? - It 's the one possible sanctuary . - Why ? Zelda ! No closer . Cease firing . Firing ceased . Take in a ground force . You command . - But Madam ... - Ginka ! Do as I say . They 're diseased , Zelda . No . They 've stopped firing . I wonder why . Because of these . They 're implanted with her cells . - Servalan 's ? - Her surrogate womb . Birth by proxy . After infecting the entire planet in the first place . - You must be Zelda . - That 's right . Cally ? ( SURREAL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) So , those little monsters give us a breather . Not that it 'll do us much good without bracelets to get us up to the Liberator . Could be . If they 've somehow found out about Servalan 's urge to breed . - But how ? - Cally won 't be short of telepathic vibes . - Her sister 's there , remember . - Yes , but ... It 's the only possible lead we have . But if it 's wrong ? If he 's lying ? Just be ready to bring me straight back up . All right , down . You 'd better be right . - I told you to take in a ground force . - I know , but I think you are mistaken . - About what ? - The replication plant . Cally , Avon and Tarrant , they must die now . - Not in there . - Why not ? Surely you are not that concerned for Capt. Deral 's offspring . Deral ? What are you talking about ? He persuaded Franton to remove some cells ... from one of the placentas and replace them with his own . Whose cells did he replace ? You were with him all the time , weren 't you ? No . I left him alone there , when I went to give you your orders . The firing point , now ! ( DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) You don 't look well . - I just hope Orac can sort us out . - Relax . Orac did a grand therapy job on their traffic controller . Franton ... Zelda , you 'll have to evacuate with us . They 'll be here soon , Zelda . It won 't just be bugs they 're bringing . He 's right , Zelda . Get them on . - Ready , everyone ? - Wait , the gene stocks . Ready ? I think it 's the nutrient flow balance . - What are you doing ? - I have to adjust it . - There isn 't time for that . - Leave it , Zelda . - But the foetuses will die . - They 're going to die anyway . Vila , get us out of here . Zelda ! Ready to fire . Fire . You must get out of there , Zelda . Put the bracelet on . Even Servalan 's children must have a chance , Cally . Zelda ! Cally ! ( ZELDA SCREAMING ) ( SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) Servalan must have destroyed the plant . Why would she do that ? Why kill the babies ? Even her own babies . Ginka . Ginka ! We got them . You lied . You lied to me . They were mine . I felt them die . ( SCREAMING ) - Deral . - What ? Tell Servalan she missed us . It was for nothing . All of it was for nothing . And tell her Auron 's children will return . You can 't . No ? Happy landings . Deral . Well ? No ! ( DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) - Feeling better ? - Yes , thanks to Orac . - Did you look in on the others ? - They 're fine . - And Cally ? - She 'll be all right , she 's sleeping . Zen , course . Course 0-3-K-2-0 for the planet Kahn . Kahn ? It is within the specified parameters . An uninhabited Earth-type planet capable of supporting an Auron colony . - Flight time ? - 40 hours at present speed . Increase speed . - No , Avon . Let 's not rush it . - Why not ? The gene stocks that Franton has , contains the potential for 5,000 children . Franton and Patar are going to be busy on Kahn . Maybe we should let them rest . Maybe we should . It 's likely to be the last rest they 'll get . Zen , maintain present speed . What about Cally ? You think she 'll want to go with them ? Cally will stay with us . We are closer to her than they are . Besides , a nursery of 5,000 ... Would you want to go with them ? ( THEME MUSIC )

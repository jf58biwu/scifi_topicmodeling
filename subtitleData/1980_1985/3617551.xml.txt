 Central Studio of Children and Youth Films named after M. GORKY First Creative Union THE VISITOR FROM THE FUTURE Part One - Hi . - Hi . Did you see her ? - Who is she ? - Let 's go . We mustn 't miss her . Tell me who is she ? Did you see it ? I told you ! Who knows what she needs there . People have been moved from this house 6 months ago . It would make sense if it was a hooligan or a bum . Does she look like either of those ? - What do you suggest ? - Let 's follow her . It 's the third time I see her leaving this house . I was afraid to go in alone . She might be with someone . - Masked . - Maybe she 's a murderer . Look , Fima , it 's easy to explain . She came from Kanatop , she 's got problems with a hotel . She saw an empty house and decided to spend a night there . - Do you believe in it ? - Why not ? We 've got to ask her . Let 's go then . Don 't you see , I need to buy some kefir . My parents are coming soon , and I promised to . If she sees us , we 'll tell her we 're from utilities services . What do utilities services do in an empty house ? Just checking if there 's a gas leak . You said that people have been moved . What do you suggest me to tell her ? That we 're television servicemen ? Maybe electricians ? Do what you want , I 'm leaving . Kolya , wait . It 's the real mystery . You 're gonna regret if you leave . Okay , but not for long . We 'll come inside , say that we 're sorty , you 'll say you lived here and forgot your text-book . You 're a genius . Go first . - I think we shouldn 't . - Yes , we should . Are you scared ? There 's no one there . Let 's get out of here . Quiet ! She might be upstairs . Alright , let 's check there and leave then . Why don 't they take this house down ? They don 't , because prince Volkonskiy lived here . Or maybe it was Trubetskoy . Prince could 've built a better house . Of stone for example . It was an unusual prince . He was a Decembrist . Maybe Pushkin came to visit him . I think you 're exaggerating a little . I swear . A restorer lives near us , he said that to my father . This house is going to be reconstructed so it would look like it did before . I even think they kept arms here to use it for overthrowing autocracy . - She left . - Where ? Through the window ? Okay , I still have to buy kefir . - Wait , but she was here , wasn 't she ? - Then keep looking for her . - Go into the circle . - I 'm here already . - Grasp the hand-rails . - Where are they ? Close your eyes . Breathe deeply . Don 't cheat . Transferring is finished . Have a good trip ! Once you finished cleaning , don 't forget to switch off the control board . Will do . Why are you so sad , Verter ? No reason . Where are you going to be ? Are you going to Kosmodrome ? Why are you asking ? No reason . In case somebody calls . Today 's a weekend . Finally it is going to be over , and I will play chess . Actually , I need to retire . I am going to notify Litvok about it . Let him allow me to have some rest . I am very tired with such work . Hello , Ivan Sergeevich . Hi ! Where have you been ? I 've been rescuing the Alexandria Library from the fire . This is an unknown Aischylos tragedy . And this is Aristophanes autograph . Congratulations ! Thank you , Verter . Now I 'm going to have a shower and go to bed . - Just a minute , Ivan Sergeevich . - What ? You cannot go to have a shower before we make a list of all the documents . What a bureaucrat you are , Verter ! I spent all month in battles and walking . I was drowning in the Mediterranean Sea . I was dying of starvation in the Egypt sands . I worked like a horse during the fire in Alexandria . And I haven 't had a single shower during that . But if we screw up with the documentation our children will not forgive us . What is your inventory number ? 777 . Aischylos tragedy . Are you sure this is Aischylos tragedy ? Yes , I am . It 's stated there . It is not in Russian . Of course it 's not , Verter . Aischylos couldn 't write tragedies in Russian . It is a pity ... that I have to believe your words . Ivanov A.V. Brought a creature from the Age of Reptiles the other day . And we registered it as a pterodactyl . But it turned out to be a pterosaur . I had to rewrite the whole page . It 's terrible . - My dear friends , hello . - Gogi , let me embrace you . Don 't ! You may soil my suit . I 've just returned from Voltaire . It 's a terrific old man . What freshness of his thoughts ... Excuse me , I am trying to concentrate here . " Aristophanes " or " Arestophanes " ? Whatever you like . - Gogi , do you wanna go fishing ? - I have to write a report . Besides , I don 't think fishing suits us . Hunting is much better . Gogi , you 're the best fisherman , I 'm very surprised . You know , I 'm surprised too , but in out 18th century ... Ha-ha-ha-ha . Don 't be surprised , Ivan Sergeevich , professor Gogi developed his character and he needs two weeks at least to forget that he is a maruis . - From a very ancient generation . - Ha ha ha ha . Maria ! Who 's the last in the line to this bureaucrat ? Maria , my greetings to you ! Maria , what are you cartying ? What item a defenseless woman of the Stone Age can use ? Do you like my club ? I made it myself . With a stone axe . Where 's Polina ? Polina has just come back and left for Kosmodrome to meet an expedition . It 's a pity I couldn 't make it . Where 's the map ? I need to add the last Neanderthal men stops . In the closet . To the right . Well ? Sign here . You too . - Look , really , let 's go fishing tomorrow . - Of course , Maruis . I am waiting for your reports on Monday . Okay . Guys , I 'm going with you . Finally . Great ! Not a minute 's peace . Even on Sunday they cannot come back separately . Looking round ? Do not be afraid , I am not frightful . I 'm not afraid . Why ? I didn 't do anything ! Silence ! Unidentified object . I 'm identified ! I study at 6 " C " . My name 's Kolya . You know , I went to buy some kefir . Why ? Please , let me go ! Let me do my job . Please ! Why ?

I definitely should go to a dump . Everything is because of her . Are you talking about the woman who was here ? That 's right . To ruin the reputation of such a beautiful woman as Polina is . Because of some stupid boy who noses into our business . You know , I went to buy some kefir , then I met Fima and her . Her . Do you think I am in love with her ? No . I adore her . With my sensitive nature and delicate electronic organization , I should have been a poet . And who am I ? I am a cleaner in the Institute of Time . Nobody loves me . Nobody needs me . I 'm just a modest cleaner Verter . Now I have to deliver you to the museum . - Museum ? - As it should be . And to ruin the reputation of Polina . No , I will not deliver you to the museum . I will do something else . Follow me . Stand into the circle . Choose as the destination " 3 " . And in 5 minutes you will be at home , in your time . And where am I now ? Didn 't you understand ?

Let 's do the following : You 'll show me something here and then - poetry . All right . Then , the first and the only concert of medieval music . Uruguayan band of folk instruments . I saw it two days ago . It was marvelous . Verter , let 's listen to it later . And you said you were a romantic . Then Goyah 's exhibition . We have our own Goyah . Then ice dancing . Of course , ice dancing . Verter , do you have anything that you didn 't have 100 years ago ? The contest of robots guitar players . Verter , it 's interesting . Think more . The Third Star Expedition is coming back today . Polina is going to be at Kosmodrome too . I would like to be there too . Many people are going to be there . Let 's go together . Is it far ? 15 minutes . Let 's hurty then . The Third Star Expedition - It 's huge ! No , I am not allowed , not allowed . I am at the service . Don 't stay too long .

You wear wrong clothes . Why ? - Are you going to Prospect Mira ? - Yes . That means you 're going to the carnival . During my time , which you represent with your costume , all boys had to wear school uniform , which included a suit . - Do you know what a suit is ? - I can guess . Is it a suit on you ? Obviously , it was sewed nowadays . And people , who have no idea what it was a hundred years ago . How come you know that ? - I am 132 and let me ... - It 's impossible . I 'd say you 're 60 , not more . What a young flatterer you are . Do I really look so young ? Of course . And the reason of that is sport !

No , no . I saw strange creatures there . What creatures ? They came out from crates and almost killed me . Dear Kolya , your imagination goes the limit . Although when I was young I met robbers , pirates too . No , I really saw them . My friend , we don 't have time for discussing your theories now . I have an offer for you . Do you want to meet my son ? Who is your son ? My son is a captain of a star ship Fyodor Poloskov . He 's gonna be here any minute . Here are his friends , waiting for him . I thought I 'd meet you again . Professor , let me introduce you my little friend Kolya . - Nice to meet you . - Kolya . And he 's professor Seleznyov . The director of Cosmo Zoo . He 's the biggest expert in space animals . Is there a Cosmo Zoo in Moscow ? Haven 't you been there ? Professor , Kolya is not an ordinary boy . - Where is Alice ? - As always . In Cosmo Zoo . - Good afternoon . - Good afternoon . Is it professor Seleznyov ? Yes . The biggest expert ... Very good . Seleznyov , let me introduce my friend , he 's a scientist . He 's inventing Mielophone . Oh , yes , nice to meet you . You run , I follow you , I run , you follow me . It is ... co ... cooperation . Right ? Excuse me , what planet are you from ? From the Archer 's system . He flew here to see what you have done . Then we 'd better speak his own language . My friend has left his homeland many years ago . Out of respect he prefers speaking the Earth 's language . What are you interested in ? I want to look at Mielophone . First I need to meet my friends with Pavel . Where is Mielophone ? - Alice has it . - And where is Alice ? Alice in Cosmo Zoo . She reeds some mysterious animals ' mind with it . What a valuable device ! You can read other people 's mind with it . It 's the power over the universe ! And you gave it to your daughter ? You know Alice , I trust her . Mister Pavel . Attention , all who is meeting The First Intergalactic Expedition . Kosmoplane " Vityaz " is landing at Kosmodrome 1 at 12 : 55 . Mister Pavel , wake up . My dear friend . - You recognized me ? - Yes . - What 's happened ? - Are you all right ? No . Two men came to me . They asked me about professor Seleznyov . And then ... I don 't remember what happened . Mister Pavel , I don 't understand . Who are they ? One of them turned into you . Kolya , they were looking for Seleznyov . He has Mielophone . Of course they need Mielophone I should 've guessed earlier . They are pirates . Hurry to Cosmo Zoo . Find Alice and Mielophone . Don 't worry , I will find them . Alice is in danger . I am gonna find them ! Hurry up ! - Cosmo Zoo ! - Mielophone ! Alice ! Excuse me , did you see two visitors here ? One of them is thin , the other one is thick . They are space pirates . Space pirates don 't exist . Am I right ? What ? What an odd fellow . Haven 't you seen a talking goat ? Napoleon , don 't bother him . Of course he 's never seen talking goats . You make me angry . Eat the banana . I 'm sick of your bananas . I 'd better eat some grass . - Leave me alone . - Don 't be afraid , he doesn 't gore . Excuse me , what planet are you from ? We live here . He 's the product of a genetic fault . Students genetics made an error , he started talking . And they gave him to Cosmo Zoo . Where else can he go ? I 'm looking for pirates . Why ? Why do you need them ? He must be a pirate hunter . - A hunter ? - Yes . Actually I 'm not . You know , I went to buy some kefir and then I met pirates . - What do they do ? - Want to steal Mielophone . Why do they need it ? They want to gain power in the galaxy . Don 't you understand that ? Napoleon . The whole galaxy ? I think he 's exaggerating . No , actually , why do they need the whole galaxy ? You don 't believe me . Alright , I 'd better go . Hey , boy , where are you running ? I gotta hurry . A very naive young boy . - Thank you . - I got it . They were the pirates . Who ? They . Those who tied us . Yes . I talked to them . Like I 'm talking to you right now . I should 've guessed that they are not you . Wait . You 're saying that they 're we ? No , you are you , and they are not you . They look like you , though . - They turned into you . - Into me ? - And into the goat . - Napoleon . Where 's Alice ? She 's in danger . They want to take Mielophone from her . What ? Let 's run . Don 't waste any second . - What rascals they are ! - They are space pirates . Hurry up ! Let 's run . Did you have a nice walk ? Now let 's work . We 'll take Mielophone and we 'll start carrying out the tests . Concentrate . Carefully . Good boy . You know , I went out to buy some kefir . And now I have such an adventure . - Actually I 'm from the past . - Really ? What century ? 20th . I study at the 6th form , school number 20 . - 6 " A " or 6 " B " ? - 6 " C " . How did you guess that we 're not we ? Their goat was talking . Excuse me . If a goat decided to talk does that mean that he 's a pirate ? It insults me . You can speak too ? I 'm the only talking goat in the world . Unfortunately not anymore . Here they are . Hurry ! We can get them ! Think , Senya , think . About something serious . Quiet , Cheery , quiet . Wait for the signal here . Senya , be more serious . I 'll deprive your walks . Please , Senya . Concentrate . What 's going on with you today ? Hello Alice . Hello Electron Ivanovich . How are you today ? Very bad . He got out of my hands . - So bad . - I just don 't know what to do with him . What a wonderful thing , Mielophone . I 'm always astonished when I look at it . It 's so good when people invent something at the right time . Humanity must be ready for the progress . If Mielofone had been invented 100 years ago , somebody could 've used it for bad things . Like what ? To steal a treasure or a secret code . Alice , Mielophone ! Alice , Mielophone ! Alice , come to me ! I 've got Mielophone ! Alice , hurry up ! I 've got Mielophone . - Napoleon , where did they go ? - There . Kolya 's got Mielophone . He 's from the 20th century , school number 20 , 6th form . Why shouldn 't I quit the job ? Aren 't I a romantic ? Am I worse than Kolya ? I can go to the past , to walk with him . And I will have something to remember when I will be sent to a dump . Verter ! You came back . I missed you . You know , I decided to take occasion and to go with you . Hide me . We don 't have to hide . I will leave a note and we will go to your time . Space pirates are following me . Hide me ! Pirates ? Aren 't you exaggerating ? Hurry ! It 's getting more interesting . What have you done ? I 've got Mielophone . They wanted to steal it from Alice . I took it from them . Now I need to return it to her . It 's them . Let 's run , Verter . I have never seen pirates before . It 's getting even more interesting . Run to your time . I will try to stop them . Verter , what about you ? Do not waste time . Go . Go away ! You , a tin ! I 'll kill you ! I am a biorobot . And nobody has ever insulted me like that ! Go into the circle . Grasp the hand-rails . Can 't they walk ? Why do they always run ? One can break a neck running . At our time first you think , then run . And now - run and then think . - Where 's he ? - Who ? - The boy . - With the bottles . He ran over there . And adults run too . What weird clothes they wear ! - Where did they run ? - Who ? A boy , then two men - a thick one and a thin one . Over there . And girls run too . Wait ! Stop ! Don 't you have milk ? Fima , one day you 'll burst . You should understand that . I have a bigger body , so I have to eat more . Okay , go on telling me your story , I 'm listening very attentively . I told you everything . I left the time machine and went to the shop . - To the shop ? - I still had to buy kefir . And you could think about kefir at that moment ? I always thought about kefir . Even at Kosmodrome . What 's next ? That 's all . Now I don 't know what to do . - Go underground . - Why ? Don 't you understand what a dangerous criminal you are ? You wanted to go to the future . Brought much trouble . You stole that thing ... Mielophone . You didn 't show it to me , by the way . I hid it . What if your mother finds it ? She doesn 't interfere in my private life . You 're a lucky one with that . If she finds it accidentally ? It 's hidden in some stuff . - Wipe your hands . - They 're clean . Hide , or even burn . Are you insane ? Okay , give it to me . I wonder , what article of the criminal code gives the best fit for you . - Did you leave traces there ? - What traces ? Maybe you met someone . Maybe left your address . No , I told everybody I 'm from Kanatop . Business is business . Fima , maybe I should run to the future again . Yeah , they 're waiting for you there . I 'll just reach the Institute , leave Mielophone with a note . " I 'm guilty , but I wanted to do the best . " They 're gonna catch you there . And you 're gonna have to prove that you didn 't do it on purpose . Burn Mielophone .

You 're telling me that your father is Biologist-biologist , right ? Yes . - Then he doesn 't work in Moscow . - Why not ? Because he 's either in Baikonur or Star Town . No , he 's now ... Never mind , you won 't understand me . Moreover you give yourself airs . Hi , girls . Yulia , this is for you . Alice , this is for you . You 're the last ones . Mark the temperature yourself , okay ? Don 't forget to , I 'll check tomorrow . What happened , Shura ? You 're late ? Girls , it 's just a disaster . What happened ? My nails and hair are ugly . - So what ? - One person invited me to the cinema . A movie at 7 : 30 pm . I can 't understand why he likes me . Alik Borisovich ? How did you guess ? He was in a hurry to write the dissertation . So he left then , while I 'm talking to you . What 's the name of the movie ? I don 't know . Does it matter ? She 's strange . I 'd never go to an unknown movie . What if I had seen it already . I guess you have never been in love . - And what about you ? - I forgot . You 're so hard . You want an apple ? I 'd like to eat my grandmother 's pie . - I 'd eat a brambullet . - There 's no such thing . - We have it . - Who " we " ? Doesn 't matter . So what do you make " brambrullet " from ? Brambullet , not brambrullet . I make it myself . Just take an ordinary maugustine and fry it on the petyar oil . - Petyar oil is the key , right ? - That 's right . But if we use butter ? You can 't make it with butter . What do you make petyar oil from ? From angeldine petyars . Isn 't it obvious ? It 's really obvious . I love angeldine petyars . And where can you find ordinary maugustine ? In India . Where else ? Kolya , maybe we shouldn 't . They can catch you . And what should we do ? We need to adjust observation . I 'm afraid they are waiting for us . Go home if you 're afraid . I can do it myself . I warn you the last time . There 's an ambush . We gotta try anyway . At worst I 'll put Mielophone to the cabin . Somebody will find it . If pirates find it first ? Then I 'll go to the future for a minute and will wait for them there . Follow me . Wow ! - Why did they make it ? - What ? - This hall , columns . - How come I know ? Ask them . I was standing here and the door opened . And there was a brick wall . It opened too . Then I saw bright light . - This wall isn 't made of brick . - They closed it . But there was a brick wall . Maybe you confused the basements ? How could I ? These are the only stairs . Let 's get out of here . It 's late . We 'll talk upstairs . Okay , let 's go out . Look , Kolya , I think they just know about everything and they took measures . I warned you . But why ? They 're tired of troubles . Everybody tries to go there . - Jump ! - Are you crazy ? It 's high . Jump anyway . Go ! - I think I broke my leg . - Thank God you 're alive . What are we gonna do next ? That means the pirates are here too . They are chasing you . I wish I looked at them closely . Why do you need that ? Why don 't you leave ? Find a job as a builder . Hide . If they find me , how are they gonna know that it 's me ? You know , we 'll use different ways . It 's safer . I worry about you . - It 's weird . - What ? The same evening as we have . Don 't talk in riddles . Do you study in the 6th form ? - Yes . - And what school ? Number 20 . It can 't be ! It 's a coincidence ! Alice , you always talk in riddles . If you ask me , I don 't believe you lost memory . For some reason you don 't want to tell me things . I 'll tell you everything , but please don 't hurry me . Then don 't bother me . - Does any Kolya study with you ? - Even three . Which one do you need ? - Three Kolyas ? - Yes . Sulimov , Sadovskiy , Gerasimov . Three Kolyas . Why do you need him ? You know , he took something from us . That 's very valuable . He stole it ? No , just took it . I think he wanted to do the best , but then he scared . What do you mean from you ? Where do you come from ? I 'm from Moscow . Are you sure ? Yes , but the difference is that I 'm gonna live ... actually I live in 100 years . I wasn 't born yet . Say what ? I 'm from the future . Crazy ! Of course it 's hard to believe in . I don 't know if I believed if I were you . I 'm trying . How did Kolya get to you ? Through the time machine . - So it exists , doesn 't it ? - Of course , it does . But it 's fiction . - You see , you don 't ... - No , I believe you , go on . I don 't know what to add . I live in Moscow , I study at school . Nothing special . Have you been to the Moon ? To the Moon , to Mars and deep space . And you 're telling me nothing special ? Who is that ? I don 't like this noise . Alice , we 've got good news for you . Don 't worry . What happened ? Everything 's fine . We found your father . - My father ? - Yes . It 's so interesting . Why aren 't you happy ? It 's natural . She 's shocked . But nobody knows I 'm here . Everybody knows . Everybody worries . Ask the father in . We 're gonna let her go home . At night ? Maybe tomorrow morning , with the director 's permission . This is my order . I see . We need to stimulate . I see . Here 's our daddy . Hi , little girl . My girl . Hi , daddy . She remembered ! She remembered ! She remembered ! Alexander Borisovich , you 're genius . She remembered ! Prepare the documents . And her things too . And her things . I 'm going . She remembered ! Quick ! Tell me where is Mielophone ? - Hello . - Hello . Hello . No , it 's a hospital . How are my patients doing ? Hello , Alexander Borisovich . Go to bed , my girl . So where were we ? We arrive to the Azov Sea . We stayed at one Cossack . He was very vivid . He had a big forelock , a blue peak-cap . And he tells us , " I 'm gonna take you to the Azov Sea . " We used a boat . It was very hot there . Watermelons didn 't grow yet . The sea was so soft . What 's next ? Strange man . And he had a blue peak-cap with a red band . His forelock was ... I 'm sorry . Here are the documents . What documents ? Alexander Borisovich , you ordered me to prepare the documents for a discharging . The father came for the patient . What patient ? What father ? Alice ? Maria Pavlovna , there wasn 't a father . What do you mean ? Yulia ? It seemed to me ... there wasn 't a father . Hold on ... Alexander Borisovich , you told me ... " I order ... We need to stimulate ... " " Her father . She remembered . You 're a genius . Prepare the document and her things . " Stop it . Don 't traumatize the children . Girls in pajamas , stop ! Girls in pajamas , stop ! Girls in pajamas , stop ! Girls in pajamas , you 're gonna catch a cold ! Girls in pajamas , you 're gonna catch a cold ! Gribkova ! You 're supposed to be in the hospital ! Korolyov . I 've been discharged . Say what ? At dawn ? In that clothes ? Yes . The hospital is closed for repairs . By the way , she 's my new friend . We shared the ward in the hospital . She 's not from Moscow . - Alice . - What ? Did we meet before ? No , just a rare name . Alice in the Wonderland . A usual name . Do you want us to catch a cold ? I 'd give you my coat , but my mother would ask me where I left it . You 'll say you gave it to your sick friend . She can misapprehend . Ok , take it . But return it near my home . - Alice , where do you come from ? - It is far . You know , she had an accident and she lost memory . What accident ? And you don 't remember anything ? What doctors we have here ! A girl lost memory and they discharge her . Where 're you gonna live , Alice ? At my place . You 'd better run home or your mother can misapprehend . I am going to attack first . You don 't say a word . Lucky we , my mother and my father are on holidays . Only my grandmother at home . But she seems to be more progressive . Let 's go . You did great in the hospital . They thought you were gonna scream and yell . And you went like " Daddy ! " And started hugging . It sounds funny now , but I scared at that time very much . Even if I had told you about space pirates who would 've believed me ? Yes , I 'd decide you had a nervous breakdown . I see a pirate entering the ward , who has nothing to do with my father . And I decided to surprise him . I was very glad . I thought Alice found her father . Didn 't you think my dad is so ugly ? Look , but why are they chasing you ? You don 't have Mielophone . That 's right . They don 't need me . They think I can tell them where Kolya is . And he 's in danger . So you 're not mad at him at all . Quite the contrary . He 's a brave guy . He understood everything and he 's trying to save Mielophone . I can imagine what he feels right now . Why ? Think . Pirates are chasing him , he doesn 't know what to do with Mielophone . And he doesn 't know I 'm here . Hi , grandmother , don 't worry , everything 's fine . We 've been discharged . Let 's go . It 's news . Has the hospital burnt ? No , we were in a hurry , so we didn 't wait for our clothes . We 'll take it later . - Hello , Alice . - Hello . - You haven 't remembered ? - No , I 'm sorry . Then go to the bathroom and change your clothes . I don 't want you to get sick again . You know , I gotta tell you a big secret . Alice is in danger . Of course , she can die of a cold . Go to the bathroom ! Can you do me a favor ? Call to the hospital and tell them you took us away today yourself . That everything 's fine and something like that . That we 're not dead and nobody stole us . Okay ? Can they really think that ? If you only knew how many similar accidents happened . I 'll tell you everything later . Okay ? Is it a hospital ? Mom , answer the phone . - Why ? - Please ! - Yes ? - Can I talk to Kolya ? Talk to your friend . Are you sure it 's Fima ? Kolya , stop fooling around . Mom , ask this Fima what nickname our physical training teacher has . Ask yourself . I don 't want to be involved in your stupid games . You 're like James Bond . What 's the nickname of our physical training teacher ? Ilya Muromec . - Ah , it 's you , Korolyov . - Sure I am . I 've got news concerning " M " . What " M " ? About the stolen device . Quiet . Are you gonna come ? Okay . I 'll knock like this . Did you hear ? Ok , bye . - She 's here . - Who ? Alice from the future . Are you insane ? I was walking with my dog today . I saw her with Gribkova in pajamas . I accompanied them to her home . I even gave them my coat . She 's small , has short hair . Big eyes and looks differently . Just like you told me . It dawned upon me , that it was she . What does Gribkova do with it ? This is their devil plan . They have a story about lost memory . Through the hospital they find Gribkova . And through Gribkova they find us . Believe me , they thought through all this on the computers . Maybe it 's just a coincidence ? It can 't be . You lied to me when you said you didn 't leave traces in the future . It 's obvious , you did . Thank again , whom did you talk with ? Nobody . Maybe the goat told it to someone . What goat ? Napoleon , a genetic freak . Did you pour out your heart to goats there ? I just told him that I 'm from 6 " C " . That 's it . Great . You found yourself a friend . 6 " C " , school number 20 ? Yes . But I didn 't tell him my last name . You said enough to set your hand to the death-warrant . Okay , I 'd better go . I don 't wanna be late for school . What are we gonna do now ? Either run or risk . What do you mean " risk " ? Are you sure you didn 't say your last name to the goat ? Honestly . - Did she see you ? - I doubt it . Then we still have chances . You 're not the only Kolya in our class . There are Sadovskiy , Sulimov . How can she guess that it 's you ? Only tenacity and strong nerve can save you . You really think so ? Even if they torture you , keep on saying : " I wasn 't there , saw nothing , didn 't take anything . " Got it ? Yeah . Maybe you leave the city . I can 't . You know that I have bad grades in algebra . And tomorrow we 're having a test . Then hold tight . - Hey , you , is it the registration office ? - Yes . Look , my niece must be here . I brought something for her . I can 't find her here . - Last name ? - Seleznyova . What section ? Yes , yes , Seleznyova . What section is she in ? Yes , yes . What 's her sickness ? She 's so sick . She 's crazy . That means psychiatry . - Yes , yes . Hit by a trolley . - Traumatology then . Shura , mark that Alice and Yulia from the 8th ward are discharged . Her aunt is asking about her . Where 's she ? Strange . She was just here . Shura ! Yes , Maria Pavlovna . If anyone asks about Alice , either direct him to me or ... No . Direct him to me . Okay , Maria Pavlovna . Give me Alice 's address . She forgot her slippers . I need to carry them to her . She doesn 't have one . You told me that we can find her at Yulia 's grandmother 's place . Then give me Yulia 's address . Come on , give it to me . I need to carry the slippers to her . Shura . Mind you , I don 't believe in your story about traveling in time and space pirates . And I 'll never believe in it . I have lived a longer life and I 'm unite sure there 're no miracles . Grandma , but nobody tells you that miracles exist . Alice is an ordinary girl , but from the future . If I believe in that , tomorrow I 'll have to believe in flying objects ? In telepathy and witchcraft ? I don 't believe in witchcraft either . What can I do if I 'm really from the future ? What can we do ? It 's another question . I 'm gonna tell you what I 'm gonna do and what I 'm gonna believe in . My grandchild Yulia has a friend Alice . She 's from another city . Alice took a valuable and unique device . And two criminals stole it from her . Later one guy found this device . He may study with Yulia . And he maybe wanted to return it , but he doesn 't know to whom . Or maybe he 's afraid . The sooner Alice finds this device , the better . Here 's what I think . Grandma , this is the way it really happened . Yes , but without miracles . Without traveling to the future and any sorts of flying objects . - Do you like my grandmother ? - Yes , I do . - What should we do ? - It 's obvious . We should call my old friend Sinekhvostikov . What Sinekhvostikov ? Kolya Sinekhvostikov is the assistant of the Minister of Education . As an exception and out of sympathy to our little girl , who forgot where she lives , but who should get her education , can petition for Alice ... - What 's your real last name ? - Seleznyova . Alice Seleznyova temporarily study in the school number 20 , sixth form , since my grand-daughter Yulia studies there . Grandma , you 're a genius . No , I just have a life experience . Good afternoon . No ... Of course ... Three Kolyas . Kolya Sulimov . He 's better than the other two . He likes math , plays chess . Visits the planetarium . What about the second Kolya ? Kolya Sadovskiy . Irresponsible , has poor results in the school . He can do something like that . The third one ? Kolya Gerasimov . He like sports . Slept during the winter on the balcony . Then he was sick during 3 weeks . Lena Dombazova 's her friend . They play volleyball together . Actually , you know , any of them could 've run to the future . Grandma , if there 's a stranger , we don 't live here . What kind of stranger ? What can I help you ? I 'm from school . My teacher told me to ask Yulia and Alice to help us . To do what ? They are going to help me to prepare for the exam . What exam ? The main one . Botany . - What form are you in , little girl ? - I 'm not telling you . You 'd better play dolls in your age . Excuse me , lady ! Where 's Alice ? Is she here ? Call her ! Alice is not here . But I can call my son , he 's the European judo champion . - I don 't know what it is . - Lucky you . You , silly woman , will be sorry about it ! Nobody has ever called me a silly woman . Why are you always eating ? I miss natural food . And what do we have on board ? Pills , tablets , canned goods at best . Did you try local kefir ? If I had my way I 'd take a couple of bottles or even a pack . You 're a materially-minded substance . I can 't understand how you became a pirate . You 'd better live on a quiet planet and breed some creatures . I 'd be glad to , but , you know , I like torturing , tormenting . I 'd torture you . I 'm kidding . What do we have now ? The object " A " left the point " B " . What object ? What left ? I 'll explain . Alice left the building , hospital . You should 've said like that . You 'll never be a commander . The supervision of the object " B " , which means the hospital , we move to the point " H " . What do we move ? What were we doing today ? We were trying to get into the house , where Alice might be hiding . You 're a genius . Look , maybe we 'll take this house by storm ? I don 't like hasty conclusions . Who do you think is gonna allow you to storm a house in the centre of the city ? Risk must be minimal . We work quietly . Tomorrow the object " H " will be under observation . Keep an eye on an object " S " . Listen , talk to me as you always do . " H " , " S " . I didn 't graduate from any universities . - Stupid ! - Sorry . " S " means " school " , where Gribkova studies . Why wouldn 't you say that in the beginning ? Alla is coming ! Come to the blackboard . I want you to meet Alice Seleznyova . Alice is not from Moscow and due to domestic reasons she 'll study here for some time . Sit down , girls .

GORKY First Creative Union Kolya Gerasimov having found a time machine in the basement of an old house would go to the future . Without asking a permission . But that happened . In the end of the 21st century Kolya meets robot Verter , who felt pity to the trespasser and let him go to Kosmodrome . Kolya tries to get into some space ship to fly to Mars . It didn 't work . But he becomes a witness of space pirates , who came to the Earth to find the rarest device for mind reading Mielophone , stealing it from Alice Seleznyova . Kolya hurries to help Alice . And intercepts Mielophone . Pirates chase Kolya . Where to go ? To the Institute of Time , where his friend Verter is waiting for him . Verter sends Kolya to our time , but he dies in a fight with the pirates . So , nowadays , there are in Moscow : A ) Kolya , who hid Mielophone , B ) Two space pirates , who would do anything to possess Mielophone , C ) Alice , who is looking for Mielophone and Kolya . Unaccustomed to our traffic Alice has an accident . She finds herself in a hospital at the same ward with Yulia Gribkova , who studies at the same class with Kolya . Yulia promises to help the girl from the future . Space pirates don 't know who has Mielophone . And having tracked Alice go into the hospital , where they turn into hospital staff . But Yulia and Alice disclose the pirates . However it 's dangerous to stay in the hospital . At dawn girls decide to run away . Meanwhile , Kolya tells everything to his friend Fima Korolyov . And he persuades Kolya to hide . Alice has a problem . Which of three Kolyas has Mielophone ? The same problem bothers the pirates too . THE VISITOR FROM THE FUTURE Part Four Alla Sergeevna , let Alice sit with me . No objections . Help her if she needs it . I hope Borya , being a gentleman let the lady sit down . Quiet ! He 's a gentleman and he 's gonna wait for his lady . Mister Sadovskiy , if I were you I 'd keep silent . Gribkova , I hope you didn 't catch a cold in your pajama . You 're quite right , Alla Sergeevna . Then maybe you can come out and tell us about London . - About London ? - About London . Girls , be quiet . Sulimov , wrong page . Quiet , guys ! Alice ! I like you a lot . Let 's be friends . Do you want to ? A. Girls , quiet . Alla Sergeevna , my dog is sick . I 'm afraid it 's distemper . We called for the ambulance three times during the night . Quiet , guys ! I think everybody wants to hear the story about Fima 's dog 's sickness in high-quality English . Alla Sergeevna , I don 't know how to say " ambulance " in English . Pity . Very bad . Sit down . Who wants to help ? May I ? Who can help Korolyov ? Is your dog alive ? Sadovskiy , maybe you ? You asked me the last class . So what ? - Want the truth ? - I do . I counted that it 's a slight possibility that you can ask me two times in a row . I can , Sadovskiy . Girls ! Take your chess away . Who else ? I 'll return it after the class . Alice , maybe you ? I understand you 're not prepared , but ... - Don 't be afraid . - I 'm not . - Why are you sitting ? - I 'm sorry ? Don 't you stand up in your school , when you answer ? - No , we don 't . - Nevertheless , stand up . Nothing special . Did you study English in school ? My parents know it , and I heard it from my childhood . Maybe you know other languages ? I 'm not gifted . I know only eight languages . What languages ? French , Spanish a little . I learned it when I was in Malaga . What else ? Czech , Finnish , Hindi , Chinese , Japanese . Ok , very good , Alice . Sit down . Let 's continue our lesson . Kolya Sulimov , come out . Quiet ! Natasha , give it to Alice . Always listen to what I say . Who would ever help you like I do ? Who saw Alice first ? Me . Who predicted she would appear in our class ? Me . You know , I 'm pleased with myself . - There 's nothing to be happy about . - It doesn 't mean I 'm happy . I 'm triumphant ! It 's a great victory of the deductive method . Don 't lay down arms . We must create the plan of actions . Look , Fima , maybe we should just give Mielophone to her ? Don 't hurry . Let 's think as Holmes did . She has a task : to get Mielophone and eliminate one person , who knows too much . Why eliminate ? I was there . They 're quite normal . Even good people . We 're not talking about them . Maybe they have nothing against you , but their duty is to eliminate the witness . You should understand that . If everyone goes back and forth , there won 't be any mystery . They can find out much . When somebody died , when an earthquake happened . You know what can be out of these ? The future can change . - How ? - Like this . You will run to a library and find out that there will be a flood in Crimea . - In Crimea ? - It 's for example . In Sahara if you like . What will you do then ? - I 'll save people . - That 's right . And this is dangerous . For example they don 't consider you as a psycho , they listened to you , an earthquake happened , nobody got hurt . - That 's wonderful ! - For you . For the history it 's tragical ! Imagine , one person found a beautiful woman in ruins . He fell in love with her , they got married . A genius son was born . And that genius son invented an engine for intergalactic systems . If the earthquake hadn 't happened , they wouldn 't have been together . Read science fiction . I didn 't visit libraries , I didn 't find out anything . Where are the guarantees ? I swear , I 'd do the same if I were them . To kill you before you mum 's a word . - To kill ? - Yes . Even though it sounds sadly . - There 's an option . - What option ? To send you into the future and to keep you there . What about my parents ? My mother will suffer . - Forget about your mother then . - You 're stupid , Fima . And you 're a miserable victim of levity . Do business ! Now give the alarm ! It 's them . Get out of here . Do something ! Stop writing ! Borya , leave the class-room . I 'm helping you . And take the girls with you . Sulimov , come to me . - Me ? - Of course you . What do you need ? Look , Sulimov , I need to tell you a secret . A secret ? Why ? - Only you can help us . - Me ? Whom ? Help Alice . Do you know what happened ? - No . - Alice has an accident and lost memory . She has amnesia . Really ? Yes . She doesn 't remember where she 's from and where her parents are . Do you realize how terrible it is ? I do . The only man she found out is you . - Me ? - Yes . I saw you somewhere . No , I 'd have remembered you . Maybe not here , maybe somewhere else . If you remember where it was she 's saved . What kind of place ? I wasn 't in Malaga . Neither in a kindergarten . Neither in Mars . Were you in Mars ? Ask Sadovskiy , he can joke with you . Get out of here ! Gerasimov ! What ? Are you scared ? Because of the suddenness . I wanted you to acquaint with Alice . Or maybe you know each other already ? Alla introduced her . I think I saw you somewhere before . Where ? Listen , Gerasimov , Alice wanted to read a book which I don 't have . What book ? You have many books . Do you have " Time Machine " by Wells ? Why do you need it ? Just to read of course . It 's so interesting to travel through time . - Am I right ? - Don 't know . Never traveled . Korolyov took the book . I 'd like to visit the future . I 'd leave the time machine and flip to Kosmoport . Flip ? I never flip to Kosmoport . I just take a flyer , It 's safer and easier . - A flyer ? - Don 't bother us . We have a conversation . I 'm trying to keep up the conversation , because Gerasimov doesn 't . Wait , what would you do if you meet space pirates on the way ? Gerasimov , answer ! Why me ? If I meet space pirates , I 'll take my blaster and cut them with the laser . Correct . What engine does your ship have ? Gerasimov , answer ! - A gravitational one . - Correct . Listen , Sadovskiy , we 're tired of you ! I 'm even tired of myself , but I can 't get rid of myself . Why are you bothering him ? Maybe he 's writing poetry for me . - Poetry ? - Yes , poetry . Everyone has a right to fall in love , but not everyone can write poetry . You fell in love ? With whom ? Not with you . Go ! What did they want ? Do you think I know ? Maybe they suspect something . Maybe . - It 's him . - You 're right , Gerasimov . - No , Sadovskiy . - Why ? Didn 't you notice ? He knows things from the future which don 't exist here yet . Like what ? Flyer , blaster , gravitational engine . Alice , you 're so naive . You didn 't read our science fiction novels . All spacemen go with blasters and fly on flyers . How come ? I just think those words were made up by fantasts , and when those things appeared , they named them as they named in books . I read in one novel , Chapek invented the word " robot " . Now we have millions of robots . Then I don 't understand a thing . Alice is okay . Gribkova is like an investigator . I didn 't recognize her . She kept saying , " Gerasimov answer ! " You didn 't ? Maybe it wasn 't Gribkova . Why not ? You told me the pirated can transform into people . Why couldn 't they turn into Gribkova ? You think she 's a child ? She can take her blaster and kill you . Where are you ? Quiet ! Sit down . Don 't look at me . Like you 're sitting alone . Got it . - Where are they ? - Not " they " . Him . Here is he . A fat one . It 's half past one . I 'm sorry . - Have you seen him ? - I 've never seen him before . His name is Cheery U. He 's one of the most dangerous pirates in our galaxy . Maybe you 're wrong . I recognized him . Here must be a small one . He 's thin , with moustaches . He 's always with an umbrella . Don 't see anyone . It seems you 're in trouble . Alright , go through the bushes , I 'll go on the road . I 'll try to distract them . - Are you ready ? - I 'm ready . No success . I never thought I could get into such difficulties . Consider it as a trip to the 20th century . Maybe you 'll tell there about us . You know , actually , I 'd prefer if you don 't find Kolya for some time . - Why are you saying that ? - You 're just a real boon for our class . Is everyone there like you ? First of all we 're all different . Secondly you forget that we are you . - Maybe I 'm your granddaughter . - That would be great . You know , I didn 't move any closer today to the solution . All Kolyas behave as nothing happened . What if that Kolya lied to the goat . And maybe he 's not Kolya at all . And not from the school number 20 . One , two , three , four . One , two , three , four . Enough . Starting position . About turn ! Right leg is on the border , left leg - step back . On one - raise your toes , pull your knees to your chest . On two - your starting position . Now start doing the exercise . One , two , one , two ... - Who is Seleznyova ? - I am . - Are you Seleznyova ? - Yes . Sulimov told me that you 're replacing Gribkova . Frankly , you don 't impress me . One , two , one , two . Don 't be upset . - What 's the main thing ? - Not to win , but to participate . That 's right , Korolyov . - Olympic principle . - Go on , go on . Do you remember the Olympic principle ? - Where ? - There . Where there ? Fima , you 'd better go . The warming-up is finished . Girls - broad jumping , boys - follow me . Let 's go . At a run ! Hurry ! Low start . On your marks ! Get set ! Go ! Korolyov , run faster . Very good ! Shoo ! Get away ! Shoo ! Shoo ! Drive it away ! Shoo ! Shoo ! Why do you always ask her ? I want to disclose her . Why did she come here ? It can 't be a coincidence that she appeared here . I think I 'll just need to talk to her . Please , wait two more days . Or even three . Are you sure she 's not a pirate ? Are you sure she doesn 't want to kidnap you ? Mila Rutkevich . Go ! Slow running . And don 't fling your head . I worry so much that I got hungry . Head wind .

Honesty makes a person beautiful . If you want an honest answer , I am Kolya then . No , Kolya is different . Precisely . You know , many people tell me that I changed . My mother tells me I 'm completely different , teachers say that I 'm rude , Maybe it 's not the age ? Maybe I 'm just wrong Kolya ? Yes , wrong . Do you have Alice in your class ? Yes , we have Alice . Kolya is her friend . Are foreign spies interested in Alice ? Aren 't you spying ? Mister , look what ill-mannered people here . Mine is just the same . Okay , I 'll remember you . I 'll remember your mug . By the way , if we meet again , please remind me that I saw you . You saw me ? Where ? When you confess , they will bring you to me . - Where ? - To my office . I 'm not Kolya , I 'm the chief police inspector . I work with serious crimes against six-forms . My name is Sherlock Holmes . And what 's your name ? Scoundrel ! Nice to meet you ! Don 't forget to take off your mask . I can see canines under . Did you hear him ? What an impudent boy ! Excuse me , girl . - Are you from 6 " C " ? - Yes , I am . - I need your help . - I always glad to help . Yesterday , for example , I carried an old lady 's bag , and fed a hungry kitten . How nice ! Will you help me as you helped that kitten ? I can 't , I 'm in a hurry . The first class is English and I must check my translation . Of course you must . You 're an excellent pupil . The best pupil in your class . It won 't take much time . I worry about your pupil Alice . - Seleznyova ? - No , not Seleznyova . It 's not her real last name . She 's hiding . Don 't be afraid . Nothing bad happened yet . Something bad can happen ? Yes , it can . Tell me , how and when Alice appeared in your class ? Today 's the third day . She was in a hospital with Gribkova . That 's right . In a hospital . Alice ran away from the hospital . Help us . I am the head doctor in the hospital with dangerous children . A desperately spoiled girl was sent to us . And she 's Alice ... What 's her last name ? - Seleznyova . - That 's right . Seleznyova . A brutal hooligan , very coward . She bit , hit children ... and adults . Then she stole a tiger-skin in the museum , and during nights she wore it and robbed lone people . - It 's impossible . - I swear to you . When she was being caught she bit three policemen . It 's impossible . Possible . We had to inoculate her against hydrophobia . It 's impossible . Don 't condemn Alice . She needs help . She 's sick . I 'm sorry , I forgot to introduce you . It 's doctor Ivanova . She spent so many sleepless nights at this horrible Alice bed . - She gave her medicine . - Gave injections . And all for nothing . She ran away from the hospital , broke the door and jumped from the fifth floor . - Really ? - Yes . At such condition people are quite firm . She broke through the pavement and didn 't hurt herself . During that sickness she can jump very high . Yes , right , if you only saw how far she can jump . It 's not normal . Now I understand it . She knows English too . It 's not normal either . Is it possible for a normal girl , except you of course , to know as much as your Alice does ? Of course it 's not . I always was an excellent pupil . I was the first in my class . But I don 't know that much . What is going to be with her when you catch her ? We 'll have to isolate her . Maybe it 's better for her to be between us ? You forget about danger which she represents for people . How can you live with her abnormal strength and adroitness ? Let 's go to our headmaster and tell him everything . No , we can 't do that . What if she 's wrong Alice ? We have no right to traumatize an innocent child . First we need to go to your classroom . To make sure and you will help us . You will help to all humanity . If to all humanity , then let 's go . Let 's go quickly , the lesson is going to start soon . You will show us the way to the back entrance . You will show us where to find 6 " C " . The rest we 'll take upon ourselves . Let 's go . Kolya , you have to go in a minute and you decided to play your old toys . You know , I need to take a couple of nails to school . - Why ? - For physics classes . Kolya , I need to talk to you . Maybe tomorrow . We anyway leave the house together . Okay , let 's talk . You 've become unbearable . Something 's going on with you . Maybe you fell in love . Tell me , I 'm your best friend . I didn 't fall in love . I 'm late for school . On the other hand you might have troubles in school . I understand that . Dear teacher , I 've got a very important question for you . I 'm listening . In the 6th form there is my grand-nephew Kolya Cheery . - Cheery ? - Yes . We don 't have such pupils . I 'm sorry . - Just a minute . - Let 's clarify everything after the class . Very good . After the class . Dear teacher ... I 'm late . Hi ! Sit ! Let 's start the class . Seleznyova , come to me . With your bag . - After the class . - You can 't understand me . He is my grand-nephew . I wanted to ... Hello . Alice , it 's me . I 've got Mielophone . I hid it . Here you are , my darling . You can call yourself lucky . I 've got an official letter , the head-master will let you go , parents are upon myself . I 'm sorry , I 'm in a hurry . Don 't even think to run away . You 're fast , I 'm faster . Aren 't you seduced with glory ? Stop , I 'll catch you anyway . You can 't escape from your glory ! Alice , my girl ! Alice ! Talk to me ! I 'll kill you if you open your mouth . I don 't interfere in anything . That 's the main thing . Am I right ? I just wanted to help . He must be heavy . - Don 't . - May I go ? Sit . Don 't even think about police . Of course not . I just wanted to help to carry that boy . If anyone runs past you and asks you about us and the boy , what would you say ? I saw no one . All people are brothers and must help each other . Good boy . Sit and read .

I don 't interfere in anything . That 's the main thing . Am I right ? I just wanted to help . He must be heavy . - Don 't . - May I go ? Sit . Don 't even think about police . Of course not . I just wanted to help to carry that boy . If anyone runs past you and asks you about us and the boy , what would you say ? I saw no one . All people are brothers and must help each other . Good boy . Sit and read . Excuse me , did you see anyone here ? Who do you think supposed to be here ? A boy . A boy ? How old is he ? He 's my age . And two criminals followed him . One of them is thick , the other one is thin . He 's in danger . What has the boy done ? Not him . They want to do something . They are very bad people . They 're criminals . Criminals ? No . I have never seen criminals . They must have been here . A minute ago . If I saw something bad , I 'd notify the right people . Maybe they ran there . Maybe . I even almost sure they did . I didn 't see anything , but I heard everything . Go and look there . Just as I thought . High temperature . It 's time to go to bed . Guys , let 's divide into groups . Each group is gonna take each alley . Bad idea . We don 't know where they are . Maybe they are in Maryina Roszha . Kolya , think faster , you 're smart . They 're in danger . I think we need to do the following : Yulia , you go home , you , Fima , go to Kolya . Maybe they 've hidden . I won 't go . I have a better plan . Come on , say it . Don 't rush me . It 's all your fault . Fima , they would 've got to school without her help . I know it 's my fault , but why do you always blame me ? Okay , let 's forget it . I take stronger guys and we 're going to the house with the time machine . They will get there and we 'll catch them . No , we 're all going there . Why are we standing here ? Where is it ? Okay , let 's go . Martha ! Martha ! Did you see Alice here ? Of course I did . Your Alice is totally out of control . I told her about her future in sport and do you know what she answered ? - What ? - Nothing . And moreover , she ran away from me . But it 's temporarily . Where did she run ? Do you see that gray house ? There 's an entrance and it seems to be through , because she didn 't return and I didn 't find her there . Although I ran without the lift to the sixth floor . When you find her , tell her she can 't get away from glory . It 's a sin to ignore that . Tell her just like that . - Hello . - Hi , little girl . Did you see a boy here and two criminals chasing him . - What criminals ? - What do you mean ? No , we didn 't . What a barbarity to chase a child ! - Natasha ! - Vanya ! - Pavlik ! - Misha ! We need to do something ! Alice . - Alice , did you run them down ? - No . - And you don 't know where Kolya is ? - No . But we 're together now . And it 's always better to do things together . Alice , I 'm sorry , but I told everything to the guys . - They understood everything . - What did you tell them ? About Mielophone and that you 're from the future . Don 't worry , this secret will die with us . Thank you , guys . But I don 't understand anything myself . Alice , I 'm sorry , but it was me who brought them to school . I thought it would be better , that you were just a sick girl . They told me you were crazy . Why are you standing here ? They might be torturing Kolya now . Children , go away with your war games . I just went to bed and heard about torturing and stuff . Streets are not a proper place for such games . There are special places for that . We 're not playing . Don 't argue . Let 's go . Wait . Where are we gonna find Kolya ? The worst thing I saw him running to the entrance , and he never went out . How do you know that he didn 't come out ? There was a man in the street , he was reading a book and he told me . Maybe he was carried away with the book . Did you notice what book he was reading ? - It was a cook book . - He could 've been carried away then . Of course , if he didn 't have dinner . Let 's go . There are two questions on the agenda . Why two ? Question number one : how to save Kolya ? Question number two : how to find and return Mielophone . Do you have something to say , ladies and gentlemen ? Or you want me to speak ? Nobody chose you as a chairman . At the most critical moment , the cleverest one takes the helm . Or the ship would sink . I give floor to Alice . I have told you , the pirates ran into the house and never left it . You think the pirates are in that gray house ? We have to search that gray house . There are at least 20 flats in each entrance . So what ? I think the pirates are in the loft . - Why do you think so ? - I just feel it . Girls , I worry so much , that I think I 'm gonna scare to death ! I wish I didn 't know about it . Go home then . You 're worthless anyway . Borya , stop it ! And you , Albina , too . I just wanted to say that because of it I got very hungry . I 'm even hungry during the tests . Okay , let 's search the flats . Wait ! We can 't solve one problem without solving the other . I think Kolya is being torturing now . Stop saying that . Nobody 's torturing him . Last time I saw Mielophone in Kolya 's closet . There 's a chance that it 's still there . If they torture Kolya , he might confess . Pirates will come to his house , I can 't imagine what it 's gonna happen . He will not confess , I know him . We 've got to take that device anyway . but first we need to save Kolya and then we 'll take the device . What do you think ? You think if I came here to take the device , I will go for it now ? And I will leave Kolya in troubles ? Alice , don 't worry , we can do that without your help . We understand the situation . I agree with you . First we need to find Kolya . Mielophone can wait . That 's right . Let 's go then . Maybe we can do both . Does Kolya 's mother trust you ? Of course , even more than she trusts him . All mothers and grandmothers think I 'm positive , because I have good appetite . Then we 're going to check that house and you go to Kolya 's flat . And think out something , so Kolya 's mother would let you take Mielophone . And then go to us . - I like it . - Fima , do you need guard ? Actually I can do it alone . Okay , give me your guard . Guys , who wants to guard Fima ? I repeat , who wants to guard Mielophone which can be a reason of the space war ? If you put it that way , I 'll go . Fima can confuse something . Sadovskiy , no criticism , please . - You 're my guard and nothing more . - Understood . Okay , let 's go . Sadovskiy , follow me ! No , it hasn 't been open since winter . Fima felt it . We shouldn 't have trusted him . I knew we wouldn 't find anything here , except this rusty lock . Where 's Kolya ? He disappeared again . My dinner is getting cold . We 're repairing a bike . What bike ? He never repaired bikes . We have an assignment from school . You should understand , that in our age everyone must know how to repair a bike . Nonsense . What do you need ? Do you know a box in the closet ? Where he keeps his junk which I 'm going to throw away ? That 's right . There is a tester for electricity supply network . Kolya asked me to bring it . May I ? You wouldn 't let him go back . Go , look for it . Hmm , where did he hide it ? Maybe ... You were going to take the tester and not just sit on the floor . Who is going to put it back ? - I will . - I doubt it . Take the sandwiches to Kolya . Eat it and tell him that this is the last time I bear it . Otherwise I 'll take measures . Got it . - Is everything fine ? - Mielophone 's gone . He hid it again ? I 'm afraid bad things happened . That he took it to school to return it to Alice , but he didn 't have time for that . And now pirates have Mielophone and Kolya proves that he 's not guilty somewhere in the year 2100 . Stop joking ! Eat this . He 's not gonna need it anymore . Stop it ! Did you look for Mielophone carefully ? I looked everywhere . It wasn 't there . We don 't hurry . Nobody 's gonna find you here . - You 'll be caught anyway . - Silence ! You 'd better tell me where you hid Mielophone . What Mielophone ? Don 't start it . You think we 're ridiculous pirates . - Cheery and ... - Rat . ... running in your time and looking for Mielophone ? You 're wrong . We 're not ridiculous . Don 't do this . The boy is gonna tell us everything . He 's a good and well-educated boy . He will think and tell us everything . Of course he 's good . He 's a romantic . You could be a good pirate . Look , maybe we 'll take him as a ship 's boy . He 'll be an adventurer , an expert in space routes . What do you think ? Do you agree ? All right , then we 'll have to take his mother , bring her here , to torture her . Children don 't like when their parents are being tortured . You scared , which means you 've got nerves . We 'll bring Alice too . He could 've given the device to her . No ! Nobody knows about Mielophone . Neither my mother , nor Alice knows about it . If you scream , we 'll ... eliminate you . So where 's Mielophone ? - We 've got nothing . - We 've got nothing too . - And I 'm hungry besides that . - Wait , I think I had a chocolate . I wish we had Mielophone , we could use it now . Nice idea . Guys , what is it ? I guess it 's Sadovskiy 's tricks . He always puts something to my bag . What is it ? - We found it . - Found what ? Mielophone . Girls , I will not survive . How does it work ? - Is it really it ? - What did you expect to see ? So many things happened because of it . So you thought it would look like a space ship ? How did it get to the bag ? Someone had to put it here . - Maybe Sadovskiy ? - I don 't know . I remembered that before the class started Gerasimov came to Yulia 's bag . And I saw that he put a note there . I asked him if he had fallen in love . A note ? That 's why I asked him that question . To Alice . Alice , this is for you . Read it . Let her read . Alice you might have guessed , or you 're gonna guess . If you think it 's my fault and I deserve a punishment , I won 't argue with you , but I swear , I didn 't want to take Mielophone . I wanted to save it from the criminals . I 'm sorry for the delay . Do you want a bike ? No ? A scooter ? No ? Do you want a car ? You 're young and you 'll be with a car . No ? You want money ? Much much money . I don 't need your money . No ? No ? You 'll have nothing then . Do you remember how we tortured a treasurer from Vetriy ? Yes , I do . How long did he hold out ? He told us the safe 's code very quickly . We have time . That 's right . Nobody 's home . Maybe they just don 't think . It 's not easy . Only a genius like you can be without thoughts . There are a husband and a wife . They 're arguing . They 're fighting . They started in the morning . Who should go to buy milk . They 're without milk now . Even their cat is without milk . Poor cat . - I fed a homeless kitty yesterday . - Good girl . - Alice , let me try . - Okay . Why doesn 't he call me ? I want him to call . Maybe he wrote a wrong number ? No , I wrote him my number . After the dance I wrote him the phone number . And he promised to call me in the morning . I think it 's some kind of a fool , who 's in love . I don 't feel comfortable listening to her . It 's not an entertainment . It 's business . And we don 't suppose to have satisfaction doing that . We wasted 30 minutes and found nothing . Negative result is a result too . Now we know for sure that Kolya is not here . - And we found Mielophone . - That 's right . Let 's go . - Guys ! - Here they are . Mielophone is gone ! - It can 't be . - Don 't you know what it means ? - What ? - Kolya took it to give it to Alice . But he didn 't have time for that . And now pirates have Mielophone and Kolya is dead . No , we found Mielophone . - You really did ? - Ask questions later . Why did you send us to his flat then ? Look , Fima , didn 't you really eat it all ? It was for everyone . I 've been thinking . And food helps to think . Alice saw Kolya entering this entrance , but nobody saw him leaving . Besides that one pirate came in there and he didn 't go out either . And we checked all flats with Mielophone , right ? Yes . And Kolya is in none of them . Here 's the result . She again . And she brought someone . Why is she looking at me like that ? Doesn 't she suspect me ? It 's him . I don 't want to interfere . It 's their business . They 're all criminals . Even when they are children . I don 't want them to think I 'm afraid . Can 't get out of them . Maybe to scream ? No , it 's okay . It 's day time . Somebody will see me . And I 'll be saved . I got into trouble . It 's two gangs . What if I scream they may ... Later it won 't bother me . No , today I 'll take a train or a plain and I will run . That 's right . He lied . - Now I 'm gonna talk to him . - Wait for me . Don 't go anywhere and watch this ! - Excuse me , are you Napoleon ? - Sorry ? What are you talking about ? If you 're Napoleon , I 'll have to warn you , that the Napoleon hunting season is open since yesterday . - I 'm gonna flay . Is it genuine ? - Yes . Hooligan ! A typical hooligan ! Secrecy didn 't help anyone . When my grandfather was hunting for Napoleons , he took a bucket with kerosene . Just splash a little on the Napoleon 's tail and he surrenders . But once he decided to catch a tiger that way , and he didn 't tell anyone about it . Quiet , don 't scream . We know your every thought . What thoughts ? I don 't have any ? I swear my mother 's health . Did they catch the boy ? I don 't know , but they threatened . I don 't know if they caught him . I saw only that they carried an insensitive boy . Where did they carry the insensitive boy ? The boy ? They carried him to the loft of this house . I swear my mother 's health . I 'd never tell you about the nailed house . He confessed that pirates brought him to the nailed house . I didn 't confess , I 'm gonna sue you . I don 't know anything about nailed houses . You should learn how to lie in your age . What an amateurishness ? " I didn 't see , I didn 't talk ? " I didn 't lie . It angers me when someone sees two big men carrying an insensitive boy , and they don 't interfere , and try to conceal it . What if they have a right to carry boys ? There 's no such right ! They 're criminals . You 're a rascal ! I challenge you to a duel ! You can use any gun you want . Any time , any place . I 'm ready . Let 's catch him . Hooligans ! You can 't re-educate him . He 's too weak . - I don 't like it . - That 's okay . We 're late , Cheery . - Got it ? - Of course . What are we gonna do with him ? Let him lay here . Got it . Got it . Got it . I 'm distracting children , you 're ensnaring Alice . - Got it ? - Yes . Repeat it . You 're distracting children , I 'm ensnaring Alice . Don 't worry . Work it , son . Guys , come on , follow me . I didn 't tell them anything . And I will never tell . Where is he ? - Did you see a boy here ? - What boy ? He ran over there . I went to buy some milk . Alice , Alice ! I 'm here ! Kolya . Save me ! They 're gonna kill me ! Go for the guys . Got it . They tortured me . But I didn 't tell them anything . Alice ! - Where are the guys ? - They are following Kolya . What Kolya ? I just saw him . It 's some pirate stuff . - Where did they go ? - Over there . Guys ! What are you doing ? It hurts ! Alice , save me ! I won 't tell you anything ! You can kill me if you want ! Kolya . Kolya , what 's happened ? What did they do with you ? Alice . I didn 't tell them . Alice ! My little girl . You can 't escape from your glory . That 's it ! That 's it ! I was at the window . And you don 't understand there could be more than one Kolyas . Alice , you don 't realize what you refuse . What 's going on here ? Silly . To the wall ! To the wall , silly ! - Pirates . - Cheery . - The one I met . - I met him too . It 's Cheery U. He 's a pirate . What have you done ? You killed a man ! You killed him . I 'll tell the police to arrest you all . He 's dead . I 'm gonna call for the ambulance . - She took Mielophone . - We 've got to do something . - Fima , think ! - Quiet ! - Stop ! Give me Mielophone ! - Never ! I 'll kill you ! I 'll kill you ! You wanted to run away ? Alone ? Where ? Wait . I 'll kill anyone who moves . They won 't dare . We 're in Moscow in the 20th century . Let 's go around . Near the wall . They may not see us . Why are we standing here ? They will leave . Of course we will . In the name of the galaxy law , you are arrested . What ? Drop your weapon . You 're powerless . Wow ! Did you kill them ? That 's okay . They are paralyzed . When we need that they will come to consciousness . Fima , where 's Alice ? You know my name ? So you are really ... Polina . Where 's Kolya ? I 'm here . This is all my fault . We 've got to return . Of course we have to make you promise us you will not say a word about that you saw here . It 's impossible . Someone will spill the beans for sure . Wait , are you talking about me ? You 'd better erase Fima 's memory . He can imagine a lot . Me ? I won 't say a word ! Who knew from the beginning that Gerasimov was into the future ? Did I say anyone about that ? I 'll definitely say to someone about it . I didn 't think you would keep the secret , but that 's okay . Why ? Because nobody would never believe you . That 's right , even if the whole class tell people they fought with space pirates , everyone would think it 's some kind of a game . Say goodbye . You have two minutes . You have two minutes . Say goodbye . - Don 't cry . - I 'm not crying . I just always wanted to have a sister like you . If I 'll have a chance I 'll write to you . Alice , I 've got a question . Did you hear anything about me in the future ? Where could I hear about you ? Maybe in the list of academicians . Or maybe a picture of a great scientist Fima Korolyov . I 'm sorry , but I met you here at first time . My modesty always puts me in a spot . Even in the future . You don 't understand. if she didn 't tell me , that means it 's forbidden . If you want I can tell you . Of course we want . Borya is going to be ... a famous artist . His exhibitions will be held not only on the Earth , but on Mars too . And on Venus . Mila will be a pediatrician . Children from the whole galaxy will fly to her . Katya Mikhailova ... will be a champion of the Wimbledon Championship . Martha will help her in that . Sadovskiy is going to be a usual engineer . And he will invent a usual time machine . Lena Dombazova ... is going to be ... an actress . Poems will be written about her . And the one who will write poems ... Yes , Kolya Gerasimov . Well , I have to go . If I were you , I 'd think closely . Martha , I 'm an ordinary girl . Everyone can learn how to do that .

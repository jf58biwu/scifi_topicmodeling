 Oh great ! That feels good . Let 's go . Video . Pity . I was getting real hungry . Here 's where my four-legged friend came from . Look . There 's a whole nest of the sweet little things . Always keep a freezer full . What do you say , Kurt ? How 's your appetite today , huh ? I must try and remember some of Mom 's old recipes . Baked mouse , rat pie , fried rats ' tails . No , really . If you cook them in vinegar , they 're fine . Let 's hope there 's no need , Video . I never serve mice at my table . Crazy architecture . What are these strange boxes ? Open it . Hey , food ! Wow , man ! What do you know ? Look at that ! - Fantastic ! - This is sugar ! It 's sugar ! Come on , everybody . Over here . Let 's start digging . I want some ! Hey , I 'm starving ! Give it here ! I want some of that ! Bring it over here ! More ! More ! Hey ! This is flour ! - That 's great ! - Flour ! Here . Here . Try some flour in your hair . Look , I 'm all white ! I 'm whiter than all of you ! I 'm white ! Girls look beautiful with flour in their hair . I 'm all white ! I think we found paradise ! Stop it ! What 's all this screaming about ? It 's not the first time you 've seen a dead body . Something terrible must 've happened here . Somebody came here before us , fought for possession of the supplies , and was murdered ! But we can 't see any sign of murder . How do you explain that ? The point is , he 's dead . How it happened doesn 't concern us . Now , stop all this nonsense . Get yourselves together . - You being quite fair ? - We must explore this shitty place . Hey , look at the customer I 've got . He 's come up to the bar and wants someone to serve him a drink . No trouble . One beer coming up . The whole place is crawling with the beastly things . Don 't take it so badly , Taurus . Poor creatures are just born unlucky . Put yourself in their place . How would you like a brute like you to sweep you away with a broom ? I 've found some more of the little bastards . There 's one ! Think you can get away , huh ? Hey , Duke . This one doesn 't think he 's born unlucky . He thinks he can do whatever he wants . You 've got no technique , Taurus . Tough with the soft , soft with the tough . Okay . Come on , tame . Let 's see the whites of your eyes . You didn 't understand , huh ? All right . Don 't show yourself . I 'll come in and get you . Take it easy . Those things have sharp teeth . Ouch ! That hurt . Watch out ! Get it off ! It won 't let go ! Damn thing ! Let 's go . Come on , Chocolate . It was only a gag . Yes , I know , but gags we don 't need . Any more , and I 'll blow your fucking brains out ! Get it ? Hey , look , Kurt . Like my new headgear ? Damn it . What 's the matter with this flashlight ? Now the fucking thing 's died completely . Just my luck . Should 've stayed with Lucifer . You always manage to screw things up . Wait . That 's not fair . This could happen to anyone . Stay close behind me . Don 't get panicky . Careful . There 's a stairway here . What do you suppose this apparatus was used for ? To play with . This , gentlemen , is a video game . I should know . That 's how I got my name . A bit more complicated than most , but that 's what it is . I 'll demonstrate it for you . Let 's see . I 'll make you pregnant if you can make that thing work . I don 't think you know anything about them . - Come on , Video . - Yeah , go to it . Come on , Video . You can do it . We all know you 're a genius . You 're bluffing . Go on . I am able to win any game in the world . And I bet I can make this work . These plants are alive and carefully kept . And that looks like a water purifier . How could it happen ? How could it happen ? But ... But why aren 't all these plants grown outside in the open ? It 's along story , Lilith . It would take too long to go over it . I 'll tell you one thing : No one 's gonna get thirsty . Look at this . I don 't know what kind of game this is . Either this thing has gone haywire or it 's the weirdest machine I ever saw . This isn 't a video game . It 's a computer . Goddamn it . I never get to find a real video game . Stupid machine needs a kick in the balls . What the ... Now what 's happening ? Maybe Video provoked a short-circuit . It seems to have gone mad . Unless ... Video involuntarily asked it a question . Well , I don 't like this at all . Computers and corpses are a bad mixture . If I asked it a question by mistake , how the hell are we ever gonna find out what the hell I asked it ? Total elimination of the group . What does that mean ? It means ... the bodies . The bodies that we found . It was meant for them . In the ... In the cellar , we found strange and wonderful things ! The ones who came here ahead of us had discovered a way of artificially reproducing the things which once naturally grew on the surface of the earth . Look at this . Fruit , vegetables , flowers . Virtually every kind of plant . And look at this . This machine distills and decontaminates rainwater . Would you believe it ? Go ahead , taste it , Diana . What a delicious taste . Not at all like that slime we 've been forced to drink . It 's incredible how anybody could do all this . Yeah . They certainly got themselves organized . But with all their knowledge , they got themselves killed so easily . Everyone stand back . What the hell is that ? Only words . Once , these words were used to bless the dead . - I hope you 're good and ready . - Ready for what , Video ? You made a bet with me and lost , Chocolate . You know it . Put it on my bill . Tonight I don 't feel like it . Come on . A debt 's a debt . You gambled and lost . Now you must pay . Call that a down-payment , all right ? Good night , Video . Come on , stop that . Having to listen to you two humping is pretty nasty . If you must copulate , why don 't you go outside and do it ? Why don 't you just shut up ? I was just getting ready to blast off , for God 's sake . Now , I 'm gonna count to three , and if you don 't quit , I 'm coming down there and drag you apart ! Cut it out . Taurus is right . If you want to get your rocks off , Lucifer , do it outside . Okay , you win . We 'll go outside . Now the damn zipper 's stuck . Please be careful , Lucifer . You 're leaning on my shoulder ! Can 't you see I 'm stuck ? What 's the trouble , Lucifer ? You got your key jammed in the lock ? Condemned to fuck until you die . At least they say it 's the best way of dying , huh ? Laughing at us isn 't doing any good . Better if you came to the rescue . But two 's company , three 's a crowd . Wouldn 't I be a bit in the way ? When I get out of here , I 'm gonna kill somebody , I promise you . But how can we get out if we 're all zipped up in here ? Zipped up and zapped , huh ? Come on , Taurus , let 's get ' em out of the way . How 'd you manage to do that , Taurus ? Calmness is the virtue of the strong . Remember that , Lucifer . Bastards . Don 't be so uptight . I 'll help you to relax . Don 't think about it . Bastards ! I don 't feel like it now . Let me start you off again , all right ? Feel better now ? Know what ? I 'm real happy we 're together . Yep . We suit each other . No , not now , greedy . I 'm tired . You 're too violent , Lucifer . It 's hard to keep up with you . Stupid bitch ! You women are all alike ! I 've had it . Oh , don 't be so tense about it . I just said I was tired . Why are you getting dressed ? I want to enjoy my own company for a bit . Goodbye . I never heard of such shit . Hey , what an incredible drink . Christ , you dirty beasts ! That 's why our water gets polluted ! Shit ! Get out ! Get out ! Go on , get out ! You 'll make us sick ! Hey , what 's that ? Looks like a phone . It is a phone . Why don 't you ring ? Ting-a-ling ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Speak . Anybody there ? Well , hello , there . Having a get-together ? Can I join the party ? Looks like it might be fun . Let 's have some music , huh ? On second thought , if you 're the only guests , I don 't want an invite . Count me out . Oh , get fucked . Fucking rats . You hear ? Shit ! Damn bottle . Thought you could get away from me , huh ? We 're lovers , baby . You 're coming back to your Lucifer . Hey , rat , that tickles . What 's the matter with you ? Gonna invite me to the party ? Have a drink with me ? Hey ! Hey ! What was that ? - Something 's wrong . - It 's Lilith ! Lucifer could 've hurt her ! Grab this , Taurus . Lilith ! Lilith ! Are you here ? Where are you ? I 've found her . She 's been killed . He must 've murdered her . Open it . There 's no sign of a wound . No scratches , no bites . There 's only one answer , unfortunately : He strangled her in his passion . It was my fault . I sent them off alone . He murdered her ! Look at her eyes ! They 're full of terror ! It 's not true . I know it isn 't . I know he didn 't do it . Damn rats are just about everywhere you look . Look at her mouth . She 's trying to speak ! How can she ? She 's dead . No ! No ! They 'll eat us alive ! They 'll kill us all ! - Kill all of us ! - Myrna , Myrna . What are you talking about ? Pull yourself together . - Nonsense . Rats don 't eat people . - Myrna ... No ! It 's not safe ! Get after him ! Finish him off , Duke . Oh , why did he have to die ? Why ? Why ? Stop it , Myrna ! Stop it ! Get a hold of yourself ! Come out in the open ! What are you waiting for ? Come out ! Out in the open so I can smash you to pieces ! Come to the slaughter ! I 'm gonna kill you all ! Dash your brains out ! Come out ! Come on out ! No ! Where 's Lucifer ? What happened to Lucifer ? We 'd better go inside and look . Lucifer ? Taurus , Chocolate , come with me . Lucifer ? Lord , no . - This must 've been the place . - Yeah . Let 's get out of here . The idea of being killed like Noah , it really frightens me . Come on , let 's go . There 's somebody in here . It might be Lucifer . Keep me covered . It 's filled with rats ! Get going ! No ! I don 't want to die ! I don 't want to die ! Don 't let them eat me ! Don 't let the rats eat me ! Lucifer 's got to be somewhere around . There 's no way for him to get out . Bring Myrna along with you . Now let 's get out of here . Kurt ! Kurt ! I found him . He 's dead . God ! - He 's been torn to bits ! - No . I don 't believe it . Look what they did to him ! Damn ! Hey ! We 're stuck . The rats have chewed through the tires of our bikes ! Shit ! Shit ! - Oh , no ! - Look at that . Chewed to bits ! We 'll never be able to repair them . You fool ! You were supposed to be guarding them ! Stop it , Kurt . Keep your cool . It 's nobody 's fault . If we fight amongst ourselves , we 're finished . - Don 't you realize that ? - Get out of my way ! Okay , Taurus . I was wrong . I admit it . With our wheels gone , how can we get out of here ? So we 're all condemned to death . Happy , chief ? What do you mean by that ? I mean the person who we call our infallible leader should 've made sure our bikes were safe before anything else . I don 't know what you 've got up in here . Those wheels were our only means of escape , and we 're trapped without them , mister . But instead of checking our priorities , you started to panic and pin the blame on anyone except yourself . Look , Duke , we 're all in this together , and the best thing to do is get in there . We 'll decide what to do tomorrow . Let 's go . Come on . Oh , yeah . One more of your ideas . The reason those rats have put our bikes out of action is because they 've decided to trap and kill us . We may have made a mistake , but we 're humans with human intelligence , not rats ! Noah , Lilith and Lucifer went off alone . That 's why they 're dead ! No other reason ! And whether you like it or not , we 're gonna stick together inside ! I have no intention of getting myself killed because of you . When the chief of a tribe makes a mistake , he 's eliminated , and his place is taken by someone who can lead and protect them too . I do that better than you . Are the rest of you with me ? All right . I know what you want . - You 're angling for a duel . - What 's the matter with you ? Have you both gone mad ? Listen to reason , Kurt , and you too , Duke . We 're surrounded by rats preparing to attack . We must stick together at all costs . It 's all we have . It 's so damn stupid ! All you can think about is your wounded pride ! Get out of the way ! Right . Let 's see if you 've got the guts to lead the pack . Okay , that 's enough . You 've proved your point . Well , now we 've got to search for materials to barricade the doors and windows . Above all , we need hammers and strong nails . All right , get to work . Come on ! I 'm really getting scared . Hurry with those planks . Here , will you take these ? Stop it ! Myrna ! It was just a spider ! Stop yelling ! Stop it ! Did you hear that ? Maybe the rats are attacking . That 's just an attack of hysterics . You know Myrna and our leader : Every time they get together , they have a screaming match . It 's no concern of ours . I 'm going to stand guard . I think it 's safer . You can do as you like . There . That feels safe now . That 's the best I can do . I don 't think there 's anything that could keep those rats out if they want to get in . It 's amazing how determined they seem to be . They 're supposed to be dumb vermin , but how did they manage to kill the others ? Lucifer , Lilith and Noah . They 're so stupid . But what do they have against us ? We 've done nothing to them . Maybe this instinct to kill has been awakened , though there 's no way of knowing how . Only , I 'm certain it happened . Well , you can take it from me , and this is the truth . Whatever happened only matters to us , alive . The dead don 't care . Years ago , when I lived with my family in the mountains , our cave was attacked by a pack of hungry rats . They didn 't attack us . They devoured all the supplies we had . But these rats here , they don 't seem interested in food . He 's right , Kurt . They don 't eat the grain . It 's us they want to eat . Mind finding something else to talk about ? You 're lowering everyone 's morale . We 're superior , aren 't we ? Once it was like that , maybe . Your attitude seems as negative as Myrna 's . You 're right . Humans think they 're superior , possessors of a finer intelligence , certain that they can rule the earth , forcing rats to stay in holes underground or in the sewers . In the sewers  ? Did they always live in places like that underground ? Before the civilized world was destroyed by a group of crazy scientists , vermin lived entirely underground in the sewers beneath the great cities . I read that in a book . And what other misinformation did you read in it ? One thing I remember clearly : Their communities were ... exclusive . They didn 't accept intruders into their world . A strange rat from another community came into it and was soon killed , and afterwards eaten . And how were they aware of the difference ? I thought all vermin were the same . You 're mistaken . There are many different types , Diana , and they could tell by the smell of their urine . Rats who can smell different kinds of urine ... I never heard such shit . Whoever wrote that book you read was writing for assholes as gullible as you are . You ever hear anything so stupid before ? I suppose because you 've all peed your pants with fright , the rats know who you are ! I don 't think that 's funny . Even if the rats think we 're intruding on them , this place is ours , and we 're hanging on to it . It 's them ! They 've come to get us ! They 'll kill us now and then eat us ! Kurt , the window ! We forgot to barricade that window ! Help ! Help me ! What the hell ? Get out of here ! You too ! Come on ! - Hurry ! - Lay her on the bed ! Lay her down here . Oh , my God . Look , she 's covered in bites ! I need some water , Taurus . Gonna have to wash her wounds before they get infected . Oh , shit ! - I forgot to bring any water in here . - That 's just great . We 'll have to make do without it . How can we survive without water ? As soon as dawn comes , we 'll try to break out of here . It won 't be long . We don 't need to worry . We don 't need to , but what about Diana ? She could get sick . Okay . Video , you stay here with the girls . We 'll try to get down into the cellar , where the water is . - Come on , the rest of you . - No ! I stay right here , boss . I 'm not risking my life for one of your harebrained schemes , you hear ? You can get the water on your own . All right , Duke . You stay here with the girls . - Video can come with us . Let 's go . - Don 't be such a bunch of idiots . It was his idea to barricade ourselves in here . Let him dig himself out alone . We 're not thinking of ourselves , for God 's sake . We 're thinking of Diana . Look here , you son of a bitch . If everything you do is calculated to make me mad , you 're succeeding . Now , do as you 're told . The way seems clear , Kurt . Let 's go . Come on ! Myrna , I want to have a word with you . Come on , move when I call you . I don 't scare you , do I ? Being afraid is not good for you . Kurt was quite wrong . Have faith in me . I could save you . Hurry . Fill the bottle , Taurus . Hurry up ! Can 't you ? The tank 's full of rats . The water 's polluted . Come on . In that case , I think we 'd better head back . Kurt ! The stairs are covered with rats . Shit ! Look . They 're waiting for us . I 'm gonna warm their whiskers . What the hell 's the matter with this thing ? It doesn 't work anymore ! Shit ! Shit ! Think of something , Kurt . They 've got us in a trap . Taurus , give me your weapon . - Hurry it up ! - There are millions of them ! The revolting creatures are everywhere ! I 've never seen so many ! How can we get rid of them ? Come on ! Come on ! Follow me in single file . Stick together . Damn things . The fire keeps them at bay . My God , they 're repulsive ! Just their teeth , think of the diseases they can give you : hepatitis , meningitis , leptospirosis , plague . Keep moving ! Don 't stop ! It 's torture ! I can 't stand it anymore ! Watch out ! Taurus ! Don 't fall down , Taurus ! Get away ! We must do something to help him ! Too late ! Hurry , man ! They 'll get us all ! We can 't leave him ! Help him ! Shit ! Quick ! Get to the door ! Open the door ! Hurry ! Come on ! Open up , it 's us ! Come on , Duke ! Hurry ! For God 's sake , where are you ? God ! - Beat it harder ! - Duke ! Myrna ! Chocolate ! For God 's sake , hurry , can 't you ? Come on ! Open this door ! They 'll soon be on us ! - Hurry ! - Let them in ! Without water , we don 't have a chance , any of us ! The son of a bitch ! We 'll be eaten by rats ! Was it worth it , Kurt ? Did you get the water ? It was polluted . The rats got there first . And they 're heading this way . Open the goddamn door ! They didn 't get it . Hear what he said ? Not a drop of it . It was a failure . It 's not too late yet . Open the door , damn you ! Duke , come on ! Have pity on us ! You can save us if you hurry ! My God . I never saw anything like it . - Open the door ! - Hurry ! Here they are . They 're coming at us . Back you go . Back to the damn rats . Why should we risk getting killed ? I 'll kill you if you don 't let them in ! Hurry ! They 're almost on us ! Open the door , Duke , now ! I order you to open it in the name of humanity ! Please open up , Duke ! I beg you ! Duke , listen to us ! Here come the rats ! Open up ! For God 's sake ! Vermin , back ! Back ! Back ! - Open up ! - Get away , filthy creatures ! - Away ! Back ! - Open it , Duke ! Open , for the love of God ! We 'll be killed if you don 't ! I 'm your leader now , whether you like it or not . And your new leader wants you to himself . Open the door ! Come on ! It 's desperate out here ! You 'll find I 'm the only one who knows how to lead you . Myrna , look out ! There 's a big rat ! Now , you quit laughing at us , you dirty son of a bitch . Get up now and open that door , or I 'll blow your guts out , do you hear ? Get away ! Get away ! Kurt ! - Hurry up in there ! - Open it up ! Come on ! They 're opening the doors ! Hurry up ! Shut it ! You filthy swine ! Now , take it easy , Kurt . I only did it to protect the girls . That 's the only reason , I swear it . If you had any brains , I 'd blow them out of your head , you bastard ! No , Kurt ! Don 't kill him ! He didn 't do anything bad ! Why not ? I have to show this bastard mercy ? He promised he 'd save me from the rats . He said I wouldn 't end up like the others , that he 'd protect me , Kurt . He 's a bigger swine than even I imagined . It 's my fault , you see , honestly . All mine ! I wanted to be protected . - Go on , tell him . - Yes , yes , I promised her . Yes . Oh , listen to me . You must . Our enemies are the rats . Don 't kill a man . My instinct is to pull the trigger . You can thank Myrna that I 'm not going to . Next time I won 't be so lenient ! I can 't stand any more . I 've got to do something about Taurus ! Try to find him or something ! There 's no point in going out there . Try to keep cool . Her temperature 's really high , I think . Poor thing . How in hell are we gonna get it down ? It won 't be long before the dawn breaks . Maybe it 'll come down soon , so we can make a break for it in daylight . The rats won 't let us . They won 't let us get away that easily , you can bet . Means we have to sit tight a while . What you need are some guts . It 's no good hanging around in here griping . Let 's go outside and come to grips with those rats . They know we 're afraid of them , and they 're taking advantage of us all . That was a man 's voice . Who was it ? Maybe Taurus . I thought it sounded like him as well . If it was , we 've got to do everything possible to help him . The big chief wants to use us as bait for the rats . One more word , and you 're dead , Duke . Get it . I 'm aware how intelligent these animals are supposed to be , but surely they 're not smart enough to trick us into the open . Okay . I 'll go for it . I 'll call their bluff , and I 'll do it alone . That 'd be suicide . We 're gonna come too . All right , everybody out . Chocolate , you 've got to come as well . Later on , we 'll come back and get Diana . She 'll be safer in here till it gets light . They 're still ignoring us . Okay . I 'll go first . You wouldn 't believe it , but they haven 't even nibbled my shoes ! It 's over , guys ! The war is over ! Yahoo ! Deus , it 's your turn to go with the women . Don 't fall asleep . Get going . I 'll cover you from behind . No . I 'll tell you when it 's your turn . Wait . Say your prayers , Duke , and say them fast . Now I 'll have a laugh , 'cause this is the fall of our popular leader , if I 'm any judge at all . Oh , no ! I 'm scared ! I can 't help it ! Then get out of here ! All of you , now ! Come on , let 's go ! Come on . Got to try getting through the big room . Wait . What is it ? The time has come for you and me to save our skins . Taurus . - Looks like Taurus . - Is that you , Taurus ? Why don 't you answer ? Can 't you hear me ? God , no ! That 's Duke ! We have to stop him ! Don 't come a step nearer , or I 'll shoot you , Kurt ! You can 't stop me . I 'm taking Myrna . You leave her , you bastard ! No , I 'm not obeying your orders now . Damn thing . What 's wrong ? Come on , fire , damn you ! What the hell 's the matter with it ? It 's all over , Duke . Now , you and Myrna are to come out and join us . I will count to three , and then ... If any of you care about Myrna , you 'd just better cease firing , or we go sky-high together right now . Don 't worry . I 'm sure he 's only bluffing us , Kurt . No . I 'm afraid he 's playing for keeps . Only , this time we 're gonna have to play along with him . Okay , Duke . We 'll put down our guns . You make a run for it . Only , leave her here . That 's a pretty fair bargain you got . Come on ! You 're in no position to start bargaining . Drop the guns , Kurt . Go on . For the last time , I 'm warning you . Chuck the guns down , or up we go ! Look out ! They 're everywhere ! Oh , God . Thousands of them ! I never saw anything ... anything so repellant ! Repellant ! Help me ! Poor little Myrna , to have such a horrible finish . At least for them , it is finished . But us , what kind of a finish can we look forward to ? More matte than glossy . Diana . Where 's Diana ? - She was right here next to you . - God knows . Damn it ! Diana ! We must find her ! - You look over there ! - Come on ! Diana ? Diana , where are you ? Please don 't fool around . Cut it out . Don 't hide . It 's stupid . Come out . I love you ! Diana ! All right , you beasts ! Come on out ! I know what you 're waiting for . Come out , all of you ! You 're fighting like we are : to survive . Diana ! I ... am tired . Very very tired . I can 't fight any longer . I want to die . I want to be the one to do it , not you . You don 't control me till I 'm dead . Diana , where are you ? Diana ! Diana ! Diana ! Diana ? Diana ? Are you in here , Diana ? Find her , for Christ sake ! Hold it . No . No . Not Diana . Not her too . No ! No ! No ! That 's Kurt 's gun . Come on ! Kurt , did you fire your gun ? Look . Diana . Not Diana ! No ! She was always so ... Look . She slashed her wrists . You shot her . Why ? Why did you shoot her , Kurt ? You could 've saved her ! Kurt , why did you kill her ? I was shooting at the rats . She was already dead . Yeah . Oh , yeah . There are only four of us left now . We 'll all wind up the same way . Don 't you see ? They 're stronger than we are . What did it get us ? Nothing ! It 's worse than being dead ! You mustn 't talk that way , Kurt . Those are such negative thoughts . I 'm not ready to die yet . You 're our leader , so lead us ! Hey , wait ! Come on ! Open it , Deus . Come in . - Oh , Lilith ! Oh , my friend ! - No , Chocolate ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Pull yourself together . They 're just trying to frighten us . This is a message of death ! Stop talking crap ! Help me . We 've got to get her out of here . Now . What the hell 's this ? Let 's see . Looks as if it might be a magic lantern or something . And maybe there 's a genie in it that 'll get us out of this mess . One , two , three . Testing . I recorded this on the 12th day of Operation Return to Light . The time is 9 : 15 , federal system , and this is experimental station Delta 2 . We are three days from the rendezvous with Olmaker 1 . They 're coming to save us , but the meeting may never take place , as this whole mission is a failure . It looks as if we shall never see Return to Light . The measures taken by our scientists to overcome the damage of pollution , radioactivity , and prolonged exposure to ultraviolet rays were correct , and the failure is in no way their responsibility . It is due to a species of small animal long thought to be extinct : Rattus Norvegicus , commonly known as rats . They populated the sewers of cities before the holocaust . Feared by man as carriers of fatal and often incurable diseases , they have proved to be a dangerous enemy , a recent mutation having sharpened their intelligence to an amazing degree . The trouble started when we began to discard our special protective clothing . As the radiation level decreased , it was no longer necessary . And that was when the rat began to attack , killing surprising numbers of us and feeding on our flesh . They had discovered their perfect diet . Never before has a creature so small hunted man , as once he hunted for food in the forests of our history . Perhaps they resented the intrusion of man into their underground world , where we were forced to take refuge in the early days , when the surface area became totally uninhabitable , burned black with every scrap of vegetation . The rats disappeared for several years down there , and we all assumed that they had died out . What had happened was that they had taken man 's place on the outside , suffered from exposure to radiation , strengthened from it , and returned to claim their territory . They came in hordes . My companions are all dead , killed by the rats , and I know my end is near . Brothers , when you find and listen to this recording , I will have reached my destination and be within the doomed Delta 2 computer center . And I must warn you to remain where you are in the control room . It is the only place where you will be safe , though its surface area is overrun by rats . They kill any who are not of the same race as themselves . Remember : Human beings are their food , and they will eat you if you are caught . Your only hope is if ... team can reach you before the rats ... remember to ... They 're here ! They 're poison ! So , there are people like us still living under the ground . It 's incredible . They 've taken over the earth . Yes , everything that was ours . I don 't understand . Why do they keep attacking us ? Because they consider it their right to take everything that 's ours . And we ... we are now intruding on them . But the book you told us about never said anything about human beings . It said the enemies of rats were other rats . Nothing about killing and feeding on us , Deus . That man spoke of mutation . I believe that under the surface , something terrible is happening , something that has pushed these men to come out on the surface to try to escape from their destiny . Whatever the cause of this massacre , the point is , we 're being caught right in the middle : men under the surface and rats here . - They 'll break the door down ! - Get ready to save your necks . - Yes ! - That door won 't hold out for long . They 're battering the door down ! You two move that console and barricade yourselves in . - I 'll try to stop them . - It 's no use , Kurt . It 's no use . I know it won 't do anything more for us than prolong our agony . That 's enough ! And shut up ! And do what you 're told ! - Okay . - That is an order ! Kurt ... They 're gathered to attack . Leave it ! Leave the door ! Go on ! I can 't hold it ! Kurt ! Oh ! Kurt ! Kurt ! I got to help him ! Kurt ! Are you crazy ? No ! Kurt ! Kurt ! Kurt ! No ! No ! No ! They 've come for us ! No ! - I don 't want to die like that ! - No . - Kill me , Video . You kill me . - No . Do it so I don 't have to be eaten alive . No . - Go on , do it . Now . - No ! If you care for me , please do it . Kill me , Video . Do it . Do it . Die , damn you ! Look , they 've gone ! Look , Chocolate ! They 've gone away ! It 's gas . I can 't breathe . We must get out of here . - Come on . Let 's go . - But we can 't ! But don 't you understand , for God 's sake ? That 's why the rats have gone . They 've come . The men have come , Chocolate . The men from Delta ... Who 's come ? The rescuers that recorded voice talked about . The men from Delta 2 . The ones from under the ground ! They 're here ! - They 've come to save us ! - Let 's go . - Video ! - Chocolate . Video ! You are the ones from Delta 2 , the people who live underground . Is that who you are ? Whoever you are , thank you for saving us . You saved us . We 're so glad to be found by friends . You are our friends , and we are the same race ? Once , someone told me they read in a book that we all lived on the earth together , that we were all brothers . The book was called the Bible , and it said that God created man and animals .

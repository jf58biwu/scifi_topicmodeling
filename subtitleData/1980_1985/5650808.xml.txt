 Will you look at that fellow over there ? I 've never seen anything so disgusting in all my life . I 'll tell you something . He 's staring . I think he 's looking at us . - I think we 're being picked up . - Oh , it 's too awful . Can you believe it ? I don 't know how they can let creatures like that in here . - Really ! It 's ... - ( BUZZING ) ( SHUDDERS ) ( CRIES OUT ) What 's the matter , hm ? Oh , help , someone ! Please ? - Please , please , come and help . - ( BUZZING CONTINUES ) ( SPEECH INAUDIBLE ) ( HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAL ) Ma 'am , she 's going to be all right . It 's all right . Step back , give her air . Agh ! ( ATONAL MUSIC ) ( SHOPPERS GASP ) Damn it ! ( FOOTSTEPS ) You 're 35 years old , Mr Vale . Why are you such a derelict ... such a piece of human junk ? The answer 's simple . You 're a scanner but you don 't realise . And that has been the source of all your agony . But I will show you now ... that it can be a source of great power . Let them in . ( HEAVY FOOTSTEPS ) WOMAN : Not much of a place , is it ? Still , we 're getting paid for it , so ... ( DIFFERENT VOICES ) ( CHATTING CONTINUES ) Hurry UP - ( VOICES GETTING LOUDER ) Hurry UP ! ( VOICES STOP ) ( VOICES MURMURING ) ( SPEECH DISTORTED ) ( INDISTINCT MURMURING CONTINUES ) ( VOICES STOP ) We can talk now . I would like to scan all of you in this room , one at a time . I must remind you that the scanning experience is usually a painful one . Sometimes resulting in nosebleeds , earaches , stomach cramps , nausea . Sometimes other symptoms of a similar nature . There 's a doctor present , Doctor Gatineau . I know that you 've all been prepared for this but I thought I 'd just remind you just the same . There is one other thing . No one is to leave this room once the demonstration has begun . At this point I 'd like to call for volunteers . Anyone . Doesn 't matter . Fine . Just ... sit right here , please . Now , I 'd like you to think of something specific . Something that will not breach the security of your organisation and that you will not object to having disclosed to this group . - Something personal perhaps . - All right . Yes , I have something . - Do I have to close my eyes ? - Doesn 't matter . All right , yes . I have something . ( WHIRRING ) ( HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAK ) ( RATTLING ) ( RATTLING ) ( SCREAMING ) Move everybody out now . Call ConSec leader . I want you to come with me . - I didn 't do anything . - I said I want you to come with me . Come on . Gatineau , come with us . ( AUDIENCE STILL CRYING ) Down there ! Quick ! Move it ! Get down . Give him a shot of Ephemeral . Come on ! OK . ( THUNDER ROLLS ) Take it easy . All we need is to get stopped by a cop . Ah , it 'd serve them right . Why the hell do they have to send us to the old factory ? If this guy 's a scanner , they don 't want him down at Central . They 're afraid of him . He 's a scanner . Hey , where 's Security Two ? It 's moving out fast on the left . Hey , man , what 's happening ? Ray , what the hell 's the matter with you ? ( RATTLING ) You gotta pull back behind him , man . Come on ! Ray , I 'm gonna kill you if you don 't do it . Ray ! Oh my God ! Don 't stop ! Move it ! No . We gotta get him outta there . ( ARGUING ) Get ' em . ( RATTLING ) Let 's get outta here , man . Come on ! - You wanna get us killed ? - All right , all right , calm down . Last night ... we at ConSec chose to reveal to the outside world our work with those telepathic curiosities known as scanners . The result ... six corpses ... and a substantial loss in credibility for our organisation . So this morning we have a new director of Internal Security ... - Mr Braedon Keller . - Thank you . Mr Trevellyan , gentlemen ... we 're in the business of international security . We deal in weaponry and private armies . We do not trade in fantasy and pipe dreams . Let us leave the development of dolphins and freaks as weapons of espionage to others . Now , with all due respect to Dr Paul Ruth , I recommend that we drop our scanner programme immediately , sir . TREVELLYAN : Hm ? Dr Ruth , what 's your response ? Mr Keller , who composed our audience last night ? We had 25 financial and political VIPs from all over North America . Were these VIPs carefully screened ? The screening process used was very sophisticated , yes . And yet an assassin managed to infiltrate this group . Yes . And kill six of our people . Yes . How did he kill them ? We have reason to believe he ... used scanning techniques . Then do you suggest , Mr Keller , that this highly skilled assassin , very deadly , who embarrassed us all in front of the community we were trying to impress , was himself a scanner ? We believe so , yes . Well , that , gentlemen , is my response . The weapons capability of these telepathic ... Curiosities . ... is obvious . KELLER : Ifl may ? Doctor . Your programme is based on a list of 236 known scanners , is it not ? It is . Of that number ... Of that number , how many are now working with us ? As of last night , none . Well then . We don 't even have a programme to drop , do we ? It shouldn 't be very painful for anyone . ConSec surveillance has gradually lost contact with all the names on our list and I submit that this is not an accident . I think we 've lost them to a programme far in advance of ours . ( ALL TALKING AT ONCE ) I think you might elaborate , Dr Ruth . In my study of the situation , I 've come up with the conclusion that there is a scanner underground developed in North America . It has an organisation , it 's well motivated ... - and it has a leader . - That 's ridiculous , Doctor . You can 't get two of them to sit in the same room together without going berserk . You 're making a very provocative allegation , Dr Ruth . Who controls this group ? If you studied the descriptions in this report , you will find that you probably met him last night . His name is Darryl Revok . - And he was on our list . - This is total fiction . - Mr Trevellyan ... - ( ALL MUTTERING ) A moment , Mr Keller . What do you suggest , Doctor ? Eliminate the competition . H OW ? Contact a scanner who is as yet unknown to the underground , convert him to our cause and then send him out ... to infiltrate the underground . Convert him , Doctor ? How ? They 're all pathetic unsocial misfits . Unstable , unreliable ... That is because their unique gifts are not understood , Mr Keller . There is one point about which there is no doubt at all , and that is that ConSec was attacked . For our own peace of mind , we have to retaliate in some way . And I think Dr Ruth 's suggestion is a very interesting one . Except that we don 't have any scanners left to send into the field . As a matter of fact ... I do have one still unaffiliated . A very special one . I don 't suppose you speak much . No . It 's not surprising . With all those other voices in your head , how can you hear your own voice ? How can you develop a self personality ? How do you feel ? I feel ... crystal clear . How do you like it ? Clarity ? I 'm not sure . I think I 'm a bit afraid . Why ? I feel so exposed . I can hear myself . You hear your own voice ? - Yes . - Good . You called me a scanner . What is that ? Freak of nature , born with a certain form of ESP . The derangement of the synapses ... which we call telepathy . Could be a disease , possibly . Or a result of radiation . We don 't really know why . Who are you ? My name is Dr Paul Ruth . I 'm a psycho pharmacist by trade , specialising in the phenomenon ... of scanners . The woman in the shopping mall . What were you doing to her ? I wasn 't doing anything to her . It was her . She was forcing me ... To what ? ... to think about her . The 5O people that were in this room . They appeared to disturb you . Why was that ? They talked too loud . - They talked and they talked . - Really ? I didn 't see their lips move . Did you ? No , it was the other voices . The ones without lips . They were drowning me . I couldn 't stop them . The injection I gave you with the needle . What happened to the voices ? They stopped . The drug is called Ephemeral . It 's a scan suppressant . It does nothing when it 's given to ordinary human beings but when given to a scanner , it prevents the flow of telepathy . It stops the voices . It can help you . How do you know these things ? It 's my profession . This is Mr Keller . Will my car be ready this evening ? Tell us what you did , please , Darryl . I drilled a hole in my head . - Where ? - It 's kind of obvious , isn 't it ? Right here . Why did you do it , Darryl ? Why did you drill the hole ? Too much pressure . It 's the pressure . You wanted to block the pressure out ? To let something out of your head ? ( LAUGHING ) Lilian 's so smart . Can 't get anything past Lilian . You wanted to let something out of your head ? A-huh . What ? People . There are people in my head . Not enough room for Darryl . You mean voices ? No , whole people . Arms , legs , hands . What 's that you 've put over the hole ? It 's a door . Put an eye on the door so they won 't know it 's a door and they can 't get back in cos they 'll see the eye , you know . You think that will fool them ? Sure . Sure . I mean , sure , you know . - I mean if that 's the only way ... - No ! What do you know ? You don 't know nothing , do you ? You wanna see how they get in , hey , lady ? You wanna see how they get in ? ( SHOUTS ) - Darryl ... - Get your hands off me . Get off ! Get your hands off me ! Get your hands off me ! ( THUNDER ROLLS ) That 's me , isn 't it ? As you were ... without Ephemeral , without guidance . Is he still like that ? - ( THUNDER ROLLS ) - Worse . How could he be ? At the age of 22 , he was extremely self destructive . Now , at the age of 35 , he is simply destructive . In many ways , Cameron , it is your enemy and mine . But I don 't even know him . He ... knows you . Somehow he was able to gather a master list of all the scanners who were ever born . He has sought them out one by one , asked them to join him in an insane crusade to destroy the society that created him . And me ? He was looking for you but I found you first . That 's why you can help me . I don 't understand . All the scanners who didn 't agree to join him were murdered . These murders represent a loss to mankind of the most spectacular human beings that ever walked the face of this planet . You , Cameron , your brothers and sisters , can bring a glory and a brilliance to our society that has never been seen before . We must stop Revok ... now . ( WHISTLE BLOWN ) ConSec are not ready to give up their programme . Paul Ruth came up with a secret weapon . What ? Someone you 've been looking for , I think . Scanner . Calls himself Cameron Vale . I 've seen him . And Ruth knew exactly where to find him . He 's in indoctrination right now . Can he do anything ? What kind of shape is he in ? He seems to function . But he 's nothing to worry about . He 's weak . Very weak . Welcome to our little psychic gymnasium . Cameron Vale . And please meet yoga master Dieter Tautz . Mr Tautz has kindly consented to be your psychic sparring partner . He has publicly demonstrated on many occasions by the power of his will he can control his heart rate , his alpha wave rhythm and many other supposedly uncontrollable functions of the human body . - Are we ready ? - Just about . Proceed . If you would be kind enough to sit facing this gentleman here . I want you ... I want you to ... slowly release your scan , slowly with focus . I want it to touch his heart . Not his brain , understand ? Telepathy is not mind reading . It is the direct linking of two nerved systems separated by space . I want you to make a link from your brain to his heart . I want your brain to make his heart beat faster . Now , if his heart beats too quickly then he will take over control of his heart . He 'll slow it down . Don 't worry about it . All you have to do is make his heart beat faster . Fast . - ( MACHINE BEEPS ) - Fast . Fast . Fast . - ( BEEPING GETS HIGHER ) - Fast . - ( BEEPING GETS HIGHER ) - Fast . Fast . Fast . Fast . ( HEARTBEAT MUCH FASTER ) ( FAST BEEPING ) ( CRIES OUT ) End your scan . End it ! Stop him ! - End it ! - I want to live . End it . ( BEEPING SLOWS DOWN ) You were right , Dr Ruth . It was easy . This man 's name is Benjamin Pierce . These photographs were taken in a prison for the criminally insane . There 's another one . This is a plaster cast of him at present on display in the Crostic Art Gallery . He 's our only lead . A known scanner who may or may not be part of Revoke underground . Why was he in prison ? He tried to kill his entire family . His father , sister , mother . At the age of ten . It was in 1958 . A few years later he was released ... Well , they say here . Er ... Rehabilitation through art . The man has incredible power , doesn 't he ? Power ? Oh , yes , he does . I am Arno Crostic . I am pleased you came to my gallery . Are you an aficionado of Benjamin Pierce ? I 'm interested in buying this piece for my apartment in Paris . Yes . But I don 't think it 'll work out unless I can get to meet the artist first . I 'm afraid no . I hope it won 't prejudice you against acquiring this piece but I would lose Benjamin Pierce for good if I even approached him with the idea . You see , it 's part of our agreement . He will not meet his public . Maybe you could just tell me where he lives . Then I could approach him myself and you wouldn 't be involved . I 'm afraid I can 't . Then maybe you could just ... think about where he lives . Excuse me . I 'm suddenly feeling ill . Arno , what 's the matter ? - Are you all right ? - I will be all right . Come on , Arno , I 'll take you back to your office . You gotta lie down . That 's it . Take my arm . ( HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAKING ) Benjamin Pierce ? Why don 't you leave me alone ? I need some help . You 're the only one that can give it to me . Is that right ? Me ? Yes . ( SHRILL LAUGHING ) Then I think you 're in big trouble , chum . I 've heard you know a man named Darryl Revok . Who are you ? I was told you were coming to pay me a visit , Mr Vale . How did you know that ? How did I know that ? Well ... I have friends . I don 't want them but I have them . Scanner friends ? What do you mean by that ? I am one of you . You 're one of me . Yes . You know what I think ? I think you 'd better tell me what you really want . It 's the voices in my head . They 're driving me crazy . How do you stop them ? Your voices ? My art ... My art keeps me sane . My art . Sane . I don 't have anything like this . That 's why I have to find Darryl Revok . You , my friend are a liar . - Get out . - Look ... I 'm not leaving here until you tell me where I can find Darryl Revok . No ? All right . Well , then , I 'll get out . ( GUN LOADING ) ( HE SCREAMS ) No ! ( WHIRRING ) ( DISTORTED VOICE ) Find Revok . Find Revok . These are his robots . Killers . He 'll turn you into a zombie , a robot , a killer . Find Revok . There are others . Other scanners . Kim Obrist . Kim Obrist . Kim Obrist . Good evening , sir . Can I help you ? Are there any messages for me ? Your name , sir ? Cameron Vale . - Your room number ? - 802 . Yes , this package is for you , sir . ( VOICES MINGLE ) ( VOICES FADE ) My name is Cameron Vale . I 've got to talk to Kim Obrist . Come on in . ( HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAK ) Oh God ! They killed Ben Pierce . Yes . Come on upstairs . Just wait here a second . Kim . Revok got to Ben Pierce . He 's dead . This guy 's name is Cameron Vale . I 've scanned him . He 's for real . He was there when it happened . Sit down . I know you . You were at the gallery . You were looking for Pierce . I need help . ( HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAK ) MULTIPLE VOICES : Scan together . Scan together and our minds begin to flow into each other until we become one mind . One nervous system . One soul . One experience . Beautiful . Beautiful . Beautiful and frightening . And frightening . So frightening to lose yourself . So frightening to lose yourself . To lose your will to the group will . To lose yourself to the group self . No ! Agh ! Power . The power we can generate when we focus our scans together is fantastic . Fantastic ! Terrifying ! Exhilarating ! To focus the power of the group scan , you must dissolve into the group ... To focus the scan ... ( SCREAMS ) No , no . Around the side , quick ! Hurry ! Get in ! Let 's go ! Drive ! Kim ? Kim . Kim , come on . Kim ! Now I know what it feels like to die . Everywhere you go , somebody dies . Who are you ? Who sent you ? I 'm a scanner . Who sent you ? I was found by ConSec . ConSec ? They wanted me to find Revok . I think they want to kill him . But they never told me about you . Tony ! Tony ! ( HOOTING ) ( SCREAMING ) Tony ! Oh no ! Come on . We gotta get outta here . ( SIRENS BLARE ) Come on . ( SHOPPERS TALKING ) Excuse me . Excuse me . Hold tight , ma 'am . OK . Let 's move this way . Go back to the street . - Come on . There 's nothing here . - ( SIRENS BLARE ) Oh ! There 's a fire ! ( FIRE ALARM SOUNDS ) We 'll be all right here for a while . It doesn 't matter . It 's finished . And nothing can stop Revok now . We were the dream and he 's the nightmare . There 's still us . I can help you . We can destroy Revok together . YOU ? You 're barely human . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry but you don 't understand . You don 't know Revok , you don 't know how evil he is , how powerful he is . - You don 't know anything . - ( GUN CLICKS ) What are you doing ? He must have something that will lead us to Revok . Us ? No , not m ... There it is . That 's it . That 's it . Dr Ruth , telephone call , sir . Take it right here . Yes ? It 's Cameron Vale . We missed you . I 've made a breakthrough to Revok . I wanna come in . I wanna bring you an informant from Revok 's group . That 's excellent . I 'll arrange for you to be brought in . Can you call me back in about ten minutes ? OK . Goodbye , Dr Ruth . All set ? Ten minutes . We may have developed a serious problem . Vale 's coming in . He says he has an informant from your group . Now , is that possible ? No . He 's lying . Then why is he coming in ? Maybe he 's homesick . Look , Vale must know something , or his informant does . It could be about me and you . Then you 'd better be the one to interrogate the informant . Ruth will talk to Vale . I won 't be able to prevent that . If Ruth finds out anything , anything at all ... kill him . Really ? - I thought you didn 't want ... - Kill him . Really . ( SPEECH INAUDIBLE ) This is ConSec Central . Security is in place and you 're clear to land . Repeat - affirmative to land . I 'm afraid I 'm going to have to give you both an injection of Ephemerol . Well , Braedon ... No apologies , no vote of confidence and my man brought back the goods . Why don 't we save the party until we 've unwrapped the presents ? Won 't take long . I have a way with these creatures . I know that . So does Trevellyan . That 's why he 's asked me to take the informant . You can do what you like with Vale . But that won 't work . Police state tactics simply won 't work , sir . Really ? Why don 't you send a letter to the board about that , Doctor ? I 'm sure they 'd love to hear from you . - ( KNOCK ON DOOR ) - Come in ! Welcome . Congratulations . It 's good to have you back home . Where 's the girl ? She should be here . She 's in another room being interrogated . I thought it would be you . So did I. That 's why I made sure the needles I gave you both were harmless . Don 't worry . She 'll be able to protect herself if there 's any problem . Why did you do that ? Gesture of trust to your friend . I have my own methods . I have nothing to hide . Nothing at all to hide . Not even the Ripe programme ? The what ? Do you know of a drug laboratory called Biocarbon Amalgamate ? Why yes , of course . I founded it in 1942 . YOU ? Yes , I sold it to ConSec . That 's why I 'm here . Let 's say that we have ... a genial working relationship . Do you know what that lab does ? It 's been so long since I 've been in touch with them . As far as I know they make some sort of chemical weaponry . Among other things . It manufactures Ephemerol for Darryl Revok . It may even be run by Darryl Revok . That 's impossible . No . I was there . I took the place of one of Revok 's men . I saw Revok in the control room . The production of Ephemerol is computerised . It 's being manufactured and sent out in huge tankers . Ephemerol is being sent out ? Sent out where ? The answer is in your own computer . The programme that controls everything is called Ripe and it 's a ConSec programme . That means that someone ... here at ConSec ... is a traitor . And that someone is working with Revok . I want you to access the Ripe programme . I do not have ConSec computer clearance . Neither do I. But you do have a nervous system and so does a computer . And you can scan a computer as you would ... another human being . Come . Hello . Hello . What a pleasant surprise . You 're very attractive . OK . Let 's do it the formal way . Your name . Kim Obrist . Your name ? Not relevant . Now ... Tell me everything you know about Darryl Revok 's organisation . Before I tell you anything I wanna know how you 're going to protect me . When Revok finds out that I 've come here he 's going to try and kill me . Miss Obrist ... Your best protection is to tell us everything we need to know . As soon as you do , Revok will cease to be a threat to anyone . Not good enough . Revok 's people are everywhere and that scares me . To be honest with you , Kim the only one you should be afraid of ... is me . Why should I be afraid of you ? I came here of my own free will . Because " . ... I know you 're not what you say you are . I wanna see someone else . Listen to me . Listen to me . Now , I have acquaintances in Revok 's group . They tell me ... They tell me that you have never been one of them . Why are you here ? Why ? Goodbye . .. Kim . ( WHIRRING ) ( HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAKING ) ( ALARM BLARES ) It must be Kim . Where is she ? Where is she ? - This is more important . - No ! No , this is more important . The computer is more important . Access the Ripe programme . More important . But the Ripe programme is the past therefore to access the Ripe programme is to access the past , no ? Access the past . Access past . ( ALARM CONTINUES ) Security ! The scanners . Find them and kill them . Put it on the air . Find them and kill them . It mustn 't happen again . It 's always been there inside me . Lurking away , sucking out my joy , rotting my successes . Cameron . Oh , Cameron . I have a way with you , Cameron . Mustn 't happen again . Ripe . Ripe indeed . The Ripe programme must be stopped ! This isn 't the same thing , you understand . Not the same thing at all . It 's different . The first time was an accident . Fortunate for some ... unfortunate for others . The Ripe programme is cold and cruel . Very very cold . Very cruel . ( GUNSHOT ) What happened ? Keller tried to kill me . Keller ? Then he 's the one . ( GUNS CLICK ) ( HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAK ) ( VOICE DISTORTED ) on , my God ! ( VOICE DISTORTED ) Oh my God ! What are you doing here ? I 'm sorry , Mum . Mum , I didn 't ... I ... I didn 't mean ... I didn 't mean to , Mum , please . Blood on my hands . Secure the computer room . Blood on my hands . What 's going on ? What the hell is going on ? It 's the scanners , sir . They 're out . Is this the only way we can do it ? If we don 't plug in to the computer now , they 're going to reprogramme it . ( WHIRRING ) What does that mean ? It means that someone has reprogrammed the computer in such a way that the Ripe programme is locked away inside . Somebody not only threw away the key - he plugged the keyhole . Try it again . - Try it again . - OK . That 's as deep into it as we 're gonna get . Hey , Lee ... Punch up your internal monitor . Access is IM863 . Why ? What is it ? Someone 's inside this thing right now getting the Ripe programme . How can this happen ? This room is max security . We 're plugged into the telephone system . Anybody who has the proper series of access codes could get in here long distance . You mean someone 's getting that right now ? Yeah . Damn ! It 's him . It 's Vale . He 's inside . - Is that possible ? - It 's got to be . It 's got to be . I want to hurt him . How can we hurt him before he gets out ? Hurt him ? I don 't understand . Vale 's nervous system and the computer 's nervous system are joined together . He 's scanning it . I want to cripple them both or maybe kill them both . How ? Well , I don 't know if it 's what you want but I could override the max security self destruct . It 's designed to blow all the circuits in case of anticipated possession of data by unauthorised and unfriendly forces . Do it now . Sir , that would entail a total loss of all data . All programmes within the ConSec system . I couldn 't do that without the written authorisation of consec leader . Mister , this is your authorisation . Sit down ! Do it now or I 'll kill you . Yes , sir . I 'm doing it now . Sir , I have to finish it over there . Sir , this is the last step . - Are you sure ... ? - Do it . There 's no need for that . It 's all very quiet . It 's just internal switching . Really ? No one 's ever switched off a scanner before . ( CRACKLING ) ( RATTLING ) Oh shit ! See ? I told you . No fireworks . ( SIRENS WAILING ) OK , I 'll go find the doctor . All right . I 'll keep an eye on the door . Excuse me . Do you know if the receptionist is coming back soon ? Ah , yeah , I guess so . Thanks . ( WHIRRING ) Please , I 'll be with you in a few moments . I have to talk to you right now , Doctor . Would you please get out of here ? It 's about this drug , Dr Frane . I understand you 've been prescribing it to some patients ? Excuse me . I 'll be back in just a moment . Just relax . Read a magazine . Where did you get this ? What do you want with me ? Who are you ? What happened ? I was scanned . The woman in the ... in the waiting room ... She scanned you ? No , not her . Her child . Her unborn child scanned me . That 's what the Ripe programme is . The doctors on the computer list are giving Ephemerol to their pregnant patients . I don 't understand . Ephemeral . - Ephemerol is creating new scanners . - ( GLASS SHATTERS ) Agh ! What 's this ? - Oh God ! Oh God ! - Hold still . - OK , OK . - Oh , my God ! Come on . Let 's get outta here . Come on . Come on . You can make it . Come on . Kim . Kim ! Vale . Kim ? Sleeping Beauty awakes . Where 's Kim ? The next room . She 'll be awake in a few hours . We don 't want anyone in here with us . This is just between you and me . Where 's your partner Keller ? He should be here . Keller ? Seems he died when you blew up his computer . By the way , that was very impressive . Keller murdered Dr Ruth . He deserved to die . You shouldn 't mourn the good doctor 's death . You should celebrate it with me . Dr Ruth was a great man . He tried to help us . He helped me . Great man . There 's only one person on earth who ever tried to help you , and that 's me . YOU ? - You sent your soldiers out to kill me . - Never . Never you . I 've spent years looking for you . And then when Keller told me that Ruth had dressed you up and sent you out as some ridiculous amateur spy I tried to take care of you , look after you . Guide you to me . Now why would you try to do that ? Who 's your mother ? I don 't know . Who 's your father ? I don 't know . What was your first childhood memory ? I don 't have any . No , you don 't , but it 's no accident that you don 't . You were kept on ice . It wasn 't until ConSec had trouble putting me away that they thawed you out . You were monitored every day of your life , allowed to live like garbage , scum . He knew where you were but it wasn 't until he needed you that he reached down and hauled you up out of the slime . Who ? Your father . Dr Paul Ruth . Our father . No . You 're my brother , Cameron . My kid brother . No . Sit down . I want to show you something . This was a test campaign used in 1947 to market a new product . The product was a drug - a tranquilliser called Ephemeral . It was aimed at pregnant women . If it had worked , it would have been marketed all over North America . But the campaign failed and the drug failed cos it had a side effect on the unborn children , an invisible side effect . It created scanners . Yes . The man who invented Ephemerol was very excited by this weird mutation it caused . And so was ConSec . They offered to finance his experiments so he sold them his company and himself . And that man was Dr Ruth . That was Daddy . Now , I said that the side effects of Ephemerol were invisible . But that 's not completely true . Daddy could see them . He could see them in us . He had given the prototype of Ephemerol to his pregnant wife , our mother four years before it hit the market and then again a year later . His children turned out to be difficult , till he realised that the only thing that would calm them down was his drug , Ephemeral . That 's why we 're older than all the others . Not only older - more powerful . The rest of them - they 're nothing compared to us . Then what did you need Keller for ? ConSec had hardware . It had contacts . Keller could see the future . The future ? You murdered the future . That 's negative , Cam . Defeatist . It disappoints me to hear you talk that way . You 're starting to sound like them . There 's a whole generation of scanner soldiers just a few months away from being born . We 'll find them , train them to be like us . Not like Obrist and her band of cripples . We 'll bring the world of normals to their knees . Build an empire so brilliant , so glorious , we 'll be the envy of the whole planet . You sound just like him . Like Ruth . No , not like him . Like Revok ! Darryl Revok ! No . Like him . It 's as though he 's been reincarnated in you . You 're not listening to me . You 're not cooperating , Cam . You 're not cooperating with me at all . I 've been counting on you for years , Cameron . Tell me you 're not going to betray me like all the rest . Tell me you 're not . No ! ( RATTLING ) All right . We 're going to do it the scanner way . I 'm going to suck your brain dry . Everything you are is going to become me . You 're going to be with me , Cameron , no matter what . After all , brothers should be close , don 't you think ? ( HISSING ) ( CRIES OUT ) Cameron ? Kim ? It 's me , Kim . Cameron . I 'm here . We 've won . We 've won .

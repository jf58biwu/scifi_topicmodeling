 Could you tell us where we might find Alexander Graham Bell ? That 's an easy enough request . ( EXCLAIMING ) Mr. Watson , come here , I want you ! ( EXCLAIMING ) The telephone has been born . I 'm gonna give you the Phineas Bogg crash course on how to be comfortable around men . ( LAUGHING ) Phineas . Bell and Mabel are supposed to get married . You don 't understand , I love her . We can 't change history . BOGG ... I can 't give her up . BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Nice landing , Bogg . Just be glad we missed the outhouse . Bat 's breath . I think I sprained my knee . You okay ? For once I was prepared for this . Jim Thorpe 's old football equipment worked great . You should have borrowed some . I 've traveled like this long before I met you , you know , and I get by just fine . Whatever you say . Now , where are we ? ( BEEPING ) Texas , 1890 . Hey , what 's going on ? What in Sam Hill hit the chicken coop ? I think we did . What for ? Well , you see , we were gonna ... You two are a little early for Halloween , ain 't you ? Ain 't for two weeks yet . Yeah . Yeah , we thought we should get a jump on the other kids . Your friend 's a pretty big kid . Hey , look , sonny , you better run along . This ain 't no place for a child right now . Wait . Something wrong ? There 's a woman in there having a mess of trouble trying to birth her baby . Your wife ? No , Mrs. Eisenhower . My wife and I just come over to help out while Mr. Eisenhower went to fetch a doc . Eisenhower ? It 's a two-day ride to the nearest doctor . I don 't think that poor woman can make it through the night . President Eisenhower ? President who ? Never mind . Do you know if the Eisenhowers were gonna name their baby Dwight David ? Yeah . If it was a boy . But how did you ... Don 't make no never mind anyhow 'cause that baby ain 't gonna need a name except one to put on his tombstone . Tombstone ? Ain 't you been listening ? I told you that woman is bad off . My wife 's birthed a lot of babies , but she ain 't no doctor . Why don 't you just call one ? Call one ? What do you think , there 's one just standing out there in field or something ? No , I mean , call one on the phone . Telegraph ? No telephone . Haven 't you ever heard of it ? You know , you talk through it to someone hundreds of miles away . Without a code ? Just your own voice ? Yeah . You two from another planet ? No , seriously , it was invented 13 , 14 years ago by Alexander Graham Bell . You should have one in your house by now . A thing you talk through and people can hear what you say a hundred miles away ? A thousand miles away . Pixilated . That 's it . A classic case of pixilation if I ever seen one . You really ... You don 't understand . You see , we were just trying to ... Guess something happened to the telephone , huh ? Yeah . Without it President Eisenhower won 't be born and who knows how many other problems it 'll cause . Better check it out . Boston , 1875 or 1876 , I don 't remember which . ( PLUMMETING ) Hey , that 's what I call a landing . Good . You can keep your crash gear , kid . I think I 'm starting to get the hang of this . Yeah , until next time . ( BEEPING ) Boston , summer of 1875 . Red light . Got any ideas where we can find Bell ? What we need is a phone book . ( EXPLOSION ) Look out , it 's a run away ! Hey , lady , look out ! Get out of the way ! JEFFREY : Bogg , she 's gonna get hit . Hey , lady ! Are you all right ? Are you all right ? That wagon almost hit me . Didn 't you hear everybody yelling at you to watch out ? Hey , is she all right ? I 'm trying to find out . She won 't answer me . Hey , lady , I 'm talking to you . Hey , what 's the matter , can 't you hear ? No , I 'm deaf . Oh . I 'm sorry , I didn 't realize . Bogg , she can 't hear you . She 's got to see your face so she can read your lips . No wonder she couldn 't hear the wagon . Hey , are you okay ? You saved me , didn 't you ? I guess . I 'm sorry . Nothing to be sorry about . But I was delighted to save you . I 'm Phineas Bogg . This is Jeffrey Jones . My name is Mabel Hubbard . But please , I have to go now . I 'm late for class . Don 't run off . We 'll walk you to school . Bogg , we 've have to find Bell , remember ? Relax . Where do you go to school ? Boston University , but please , I don 't want you to walk me . I caused enough trouble as it is already . Well , being deaf is nothing to be ashamed of . We could ... Bogg , I think I remember something about Bell teaching at Boston University . See . You almost let her get away . Hey , least you could do is let me walk you to school after I saved your life . Well , okay . As you wish . She 's cute , isn 't she ? Kind of shy if you ask me . Well , I like them shy . You like them period . No , really , still waters run deep , you know . Bogg , give the poor girl a break . She 's got enough problems as it is being deaf . Besides , we 've gotta find Bell . Well , maybe Mabel can help . Besides , I think it 's time we included her in the conversation . I feel like we 're talking behind her back . I guess we 're being kind of rude . Mabel , do you know a man named Alexander Graham Bell ? He 's a teacher of the deaf at the university . MABEL : Father , what are you doing here ? Where have you been , young lady ? You 're an hour late for class . You know my stand on punctuality , never late , never sorry . Since when do you come to school to check up on me ? Since you snuck away from your governess this morning . Father , I 'm too old to have a governess . I can take care of myself . You can 't even get yourself to class on time . Who are these two strange looking characters ? Mr. Hubbard , I can explain . Sir , if you 're ... There was an accident , Father . They saved my life . An accident ? Oh , my God . No , really , sir . It wasn 't that bad . I didn 't hear a runaway wagon . Mr. Bogg pulled me out of the way . I 'm most grateful to you , sir . Why can 't I get it through that pretty head of yours how dangerous it is for a deaf girl to walk the streets alone ? Please , Father , don 't go into this now . Not in front of strangers . I 'll talk in front of whomever I wish . Your governess was hired to protect you from just that kind of thing . I deserve a life of my own . So you do , and you shall have that life of your own as long as your governess is with you . But I 'll not have you endanger your own life . I can 't hear you , Father . I 've got my eyes closed . I hate it when she does that . Pretty good way to end a conversation . She 's perfected it to an art . Go to class , we 'll talk later . I 'll see you at home , Father . Thank you . Excuse me , Mr. Hubbard . Could you tell us where we might find Alexander Graham Bell ? Professor Bell ? That 's an easy enough request . He 's over there in the gazebo . He 's working with Tom Saunder 's little boy . He 's the best teacher of the deaf I 've ever seen . I hired him to help Mabel when she was younger with her pronunciation . Yes , sir , she told us . He 's a great inventor , too . So he tried to convince me once . I 'm a patent attorney . I 've seen enough of men 's folly . Mr. Bell is a very good teacher of the deaf . He should continue doing that . Well , I have an appointment , but here 's my card . If I can be of any further help ... Good day , sir . Thank you again . ( PRONOUNCING SLOWLY ) Cat . Cat . Cat . Cat . Good , Georgie , good . Can I help you ? Are you Professor Bell ? Yes , I am . Could we talk to you a moment ? Certainly . Georgie 's finished with his lesson . Just let me dismiss him . Is the glove an invention of yours ? I wouldn 't call it an invention . It 's more of a teaching tool . See , Georgie can neither hear nor read lips . To get him to speak I had to come up with a way to communicate with him . We 're interested in another one of your inventions . Really . Which one ? The telephone . Oh , that . I 'm surprised you 've heard of it . What 's left of it is around my shop collecting dust . But why ? Well , I spend my days teaching so I 'll have the money to pay for my rent and eat a few meals . That only leaves me my nights free to work on a more lucrative invention , the harmonic telegraph . But the telephone is worth millions . So I 've tried to convince my backers , but they were only willing to give me a small sum , a very small sum to continue my experiments on the telegraph . Wait a minute , aren 't you married or engaged ? Me ? I have no money to support a wife . Not even a girlfriend ? I teach all day and work on my telegraph at night . Who has time for courting ? Something coming to you ? Yeah . If you 'll excuse me , I have to get to my lecture . If you 'd like to see my telegraph , you 're welcome to stop by my shop . It 's also my home . We 'd like that . Fine . It 's at 409 Court Street . When I 'm not here , I 'm there . You okay ? It 's all coming back to me now . What ? Now I know why I feel so weird . I 've seen all this before . How ? On the late show . Don Ameche played Alexander Graham Bell . You mean they made a movie about all this ? Yeah . Bell got all the money he needed for his experiments from his wife 's father . You wouldn 't happen to remember his wife 's name , would you ? I think it was Mabel . Mabel ? Like the girl we saved today , Mabel ? Yeah , and her father in the movie was a patent attorney , just like Mr. Hubbard . Mr. Hubbard . Which means that Bell is supposed to marry Mabel Hubbard . Exactly . They barely know each other . I know . I think that 's why we 're here . So , we got to get Mabel Hubbard and Alexander Graham Bell to fall in love . Come on . The way I see it , we got two problems . Mabel 's too shy and inhibited to meet a man , and Bell doesn 't have enough time to meet a woman . Swell , now that you 've figured that out , what are we gonna do about it ? Well , wise guy , one of us should bring Mabel out of her shell , and the other should convince Bell he should get married . I 've got a feeling I 'm the one who has to convince Bell . No , I thought I should . Why ? You saw how shy Mabel was . A young boy would be less threatening to her . No . I don 't think she 's gonna listen to a kid . Besides , you 're much better with women . You 're right . You go over to Bell 's this afternoon . I 'll pay Mabel a visit . I hope she 'll see you . I saved her life , of course she 'll see me . Miss Hubbard sends her regrets , but she can 't see you . Why not ? She didn 't say and I didn 't ask . Did you tell her I 'm Phineas Bogg , the guy that saved her life this morning ? Yes , and she said she 's very grateful . Well , she has a fine way of showing her gratitude . Mabel ! Mabel ! Mabel . It won 't do no good to yell , Mr. Bogg , she 's deaf . Yeah , but she can see my lips moving . I 'm just gonna yell louder until she comes down here . In fact , I 'm gonna yell so loud the whole neighborhood 's gonna know that Mabel ... Please , Mr. Bogg , stop , I 'll come down . I 'll be waiting . Hiya . Mr. Bogg , you should not have shouted like that . This is a very quiet neighborhood . Why wouldn 't you see me ? I couldn 't . I can 't . Why couldn 't you ? I was afraid . Afraid of what ? My experiences with men are limited . You don 't need experience . I just want to be friends . I thought maybe we 'd both enjoy taking a ride and get something to eat . Alone . You mean , me and you ? Why make it sound so terrible ? But ... I promise if you don 't have a good time I 'll take you right back . No , I can 't . Father wouldn 't allow it . Well , let 's ask him . He 's not home . Well , good , then he 's not here to say no . But when he finds out ... If he starts yelling at you , all you gotta do is close your eyes . I get away with a lot when I do that . I noticed . It 's a cute trick . Well , I am kind of hungry . Good . Now , let 's go . This is your lab ? Well , we like to call it home . Since we work here and eat here and sleep here . Maybe we should call it prison . You should 've seen the lab Edison has . You know him ? Sort of . I hear he 's very good . That he 's made some remarkable improvements on the telegraph . Yeah , but nothing like what you 're doing . That 's why they call his work improvements and ours experiments . Don 't mind Watson , he 's been working too hard . What 's this harmonic telegraph you told me you were working on ? Well , for right now you can only send one message at a time over a telegraph wire . If mine will work , you 'll be able to send many different messages at the same time . Well , it 's nothing compared to what the telephone can do . Well , of course , the telephone can 't do anything at all . It will . It 's gonna be one of the greatest inventions of all time . It 's nice to have one believer . Can I see it ? Well , we haven 't worked on it in months . Where did we put it , Watson ? Here you go , kid , the greatest invention of all time . BELL : Don 't pay any attention to Watson . JEFFREY : Does it work ? Well , if it worked , we wouldn 't let it sit around and collect dust . Why 'd you stop ? The almighty dollar . We worked on it till the money ran out . But you have money to work on the harmonic telegraph . Barely . The father of the boy I teach , Mr. Sanders , gives me just enough money to pay for this room and some supplies . And he gives me that money to work on the telegraph , not on the telephone . I 'm afraid this will have to wait until I make some money on inventions other people believe in . Tomorrow you 're gonna meet a woman who 's gonna solve all your problems . A woman ? You remember them , Aleck ? They 're soft , they wear dresses . Their voices have a higher pitch than men 's . I think we used to take them out on dates once in a while . I remember . Jeffrey , as much as I would like to meet a woman , I do not have the time . Besides , I do not have the money or the place to entertain . It 's not just for romance . You could talk some business , too . What kind of business ? Well , her father 's a wealthy patent attorney . He can give you the money you need for the telephone . This woman 's name wouldn 't be Hubbard , would it ? Yeah , Mabel Hubbard . Why , I taught Mabel years ago . She 's very young . Not anymore , she 's all grown up . Well , it really wouldn 't work anyway because I 've already asked Mr. Hubbard for financial support . He was not interested in my invention . But Mabel can talk her father into anything . You convince her , she 'll convince her father . I would never use a woman to obtain money . Forget the money . Just see her because you 're a lonely old grouch and her company would probably do you some good . No , I can 't , I 'm much too busy . Well , you have to make time . She 's already planning to come over tomorrow . ( WHISPERING ) I hope . MAN : Hey , waiter . Chocolate cake . Waiter ! We ordered cherry phosphate , not lemonade . Oh , my , you 're right . I 'm sorry . Look , it 's my first day . It 's too much . I just can 't handle it all . That 's okay . Lemonade 's fine , really . Thank you , so much . Thanks . You haven 't said a word since we left your house . I don 't know what to say . Come on , relax . ( SIGHING ) I think we better get back now . We just got here . I shouldn 't be doing this . I promised myself I wouldn 't see men anymore . And why is that ? I 'm deaf . Men aren 't interested in a deaf wife . That 's not true . I 'm afraid it is . A lot of men approach me because they find me attractive . But you ought to see how the looks on their faces change when I tell them I 'm deaf . Suddenly , they don 't come around anymore . I 'm sorry , I guess I didn 't understand . Oh , it 's okay . Ever since the last one , I learned to accept it . You want to tell me about it ? There was this boy , I loved him very much . So much that I pretended I could hear . He was handsome and smart . Worst of all he was a musician . I never took my eyes off his face for fear I 'd miss something he said and he 'd find out . So , I commented on how birds sang , how pleasant crickets sounded on summer 's evening , and I 'd spend hours listening to him play a piano that I couldn 't hear . What happened ? On the night that he took me to meet his parents I sat at the dinner table frantically watching everyone 's lips . I didn 't hear the maid drop a stack of plates behind me . And that 's it ? He stopped seeing you ? Not right away . He was a nice boy . He saw me one more time and pretended that it didn 't matter . Then I got a very sweet letter . Look , I don 't know what to say . That 's a sad story , but everybody is not like that . Sure . Listen , I know somebody you should meet . Somebody that wouldn 't care at all that you 're deaf . Look , some other time , all right . No , really . In fact he already knows you can 't hear . It 's Alexander Bell . Professor Bell ? My old teacher ? Yeah . Oh , I 'm sorry . Let me clean that off . I 'll get some water . Let me ... I 'll get some water . ( LAUGHING ) What 's so funny ? How could you ? How could I what ? You mean this ? Oh , no . You wouldn 't . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Don 't answer it , it 's probably the bill collector . Probably the bill collector . Hey . How did it go ? Pretty well . Does Bell want to meet Mabel ? Yeah , I even think he 's excited about it . Bring her over about 4 : 00 . He 's got classes till noon , and I 'll need the rest of the time to get him ready . Good , I need time to teach a little class of my own . See you . But why do you want me to meet Mr. Bell ? I mean , he 's got long hair and he dresses funny . Oh , so what ? What did I look like when you first met me ? Oh , yeah . What do you mean , oh , yeah ? Oh , I don 't know , Phineas . I mean , I get so nervous and shy around men . Don 't worry , if you can get used to me you can get used to anybody . Besides , I 'm gonna give you the Phineas Bogg crash course on how to be comfortable around men . This should be interesting . No , really . Start out by being light , happy . Smile a lot . Laugh a lot . What if he doesn 't say anything funny ? Laugh anyway . And if he starts talking about things you don 't understand , just nod your head , yes , throw in a couple of uh-huh 's . And when he pauses , say something like , " That 's very interesting . " Even if it 's not ? Especially if it 's not . Well , what if he doesn 't say anything at all ? Easy , you ask him a question about himself . Pretend he 's the most interesting man in the whole world . What if he asks me to dance ? He 's not gonna ask you to dance . You never know , Phineas . You know , you don 't have to hear to be able to dance . Well , don 't you think it would be nice if I could keep step with the music ? You can . Get up . Come on . ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ) Okay . Okay , now , just follow me . Ready ? ( HUMMING ) There 's just one problem . What 's that ? I can 't watch the music and my feet at the same time . Well , don 't watch your feet . Just move with my body . ( LAUGHING ) Phineas , this is wonderful . You 're doing great . I never knew dancing could be so much fun . That last step was murder . Are you okay ? I can 't remember when I 've felt better . Mabel should be here any minute . I got to go . Jeffrey , Jeffrey , you don 't have to run off . I 'm sure Mabel wouldn 't mind if you stayed . Mr. Bell , you 're on your own . Mabel . Mabel , about what happened back there . Yes , Phineas ? It shouldn 't have . It was a mistake . Yeah , of course . I mean we both got carried away in the lesson , that 's all . You 're right . The whole purpose was to get you at ease around men enough to meet Mr. Bell . I guess we got a little too at ease . Yeah . Okay , remember everything I told you ? Big smile , light , happy , attentive . Good . He 's gonna be crazy about you . I hope so . I wouldn 't want to let down my teacher . How nice to see you again , Professor Bell . Jeffrey was right , you have grown up . ( LAUGHING ) What an amusing thing to say . I didn 't mean it to be amusing . I ... May I come in ? Oh , of course . Please , sit down . So far so good . You think so ? She got through the door okay . He didn 't trip . So , Mr. Bell , I ... Please , call me Aleck . Please , call me Mabel . So , Aleck , I hear you 're quite an inventor . I hope so . You know , there 's one particular invention I 'm very excited about . It 's a device that will send the human voice through a wire much the same way a telegraph does . Really ? I 'd love to see how it works . And I 'd love to show it you but I 'm afraid it 's impossible . Yeah , I guess it would be a waste showing me , since I can 't hear the human voice or anything else . No , no , that 's not it at all . I can 't show it to you because it doesn 't work yet . Oh . Well , it was certainly nice of you to invite me over like this . Invite you ? But I ... I mean , Jeffrey said that you were coming by and ... You didn 't invite me ? Well , I would have if I had thought of it but ... But you didn 't . ( SIGHING ) Oh , I get it . Phineas Bogg asked you to see me . No , that 's not it at all . It 's just that I make a practice of not getting involved with any of my female students . Because they 're deaf ? No . ( SOBBING ) No , it 's because usually they 're too young . Sure , I understand . It 's all right , Mr. Bell . I mean , there 's no reason you should be any different than any of the others . What are you talking about ? Men . None of them , including you , could ever get serious about a deaf girl . I mean , you have to see them all day at school . Why do you want to be bothered with them when you get home ? That 's not ... That 's not true , Mabel . In fact , there 's one deaf woman in particular I 'm very serious about . I used to go home to her every day . Who 's the lucky girl ? My mother . I 'm sorry , I didn 't know . No , there 's no reason to be sorry . She is a great woman . And she taught me that it doesn 't matter if you can hear or see , or walk . The important thing is what kind of a person you are in spite of it all . Right now , I feel like a fool . No , no , you 're not . You 're a beautiful , intelligent woman who 's probably been hurt a few times . So you 're deaf . I 'm not incredibly handsome . Does that make us any less as people ? No , I guess not . I guess not . Here , dry your eyes and I 'm gonna show you a great invention that doesn 't work . Well , I 'm ready to receive when you 're ready to send . Be ready in a minute . So you like her . Mabel ? Yes . But do you really like her ? She has a spirit that 's irresistible . And she 's pretty too . Very . And , yes , I want to see her again . All right ! Soon . But for right now let 's concentrate on the harmonic telegraph . You know , I bet if you were engaged to Mabel , Mr. Hubbard would give you the financial support for your inventions . Boy , you like to rush things . All we know is I like her . We still don 't know if she likes me . Oh , she does . ( SIGHING ) I haven 't had a chance to ask you how it went with Mr. Bell today . I thought you were watching . The kid made me leave about halfway through . Well , I had a very nice time . Oh , good , good . You talked ? Yeah , we talked a lot . He is a very interesting man . Did you know that he 's perfected a form of visible speech whereby a person can imitate a sound he 's never heard ? No , no , I didn 't know that . So you really liked him , huh ? He 's quite an original man . He 's warm , sensitive , intelligent . And he made me feel very much at ease . Yeah , I liked him , quite a lot . Do you think you could love a man like Bell ? Yes , I think I could . Hey , great . ' Cause ... I could , that is , if I wasn 't already in love with you . ( TAPPING ) Nothing happened on the third one . The free end of the reed must be too close to the electromagnetic pole . It 's probably frozen . See if you can pluck it free . Okay . Bogg , come here , you gotta see this . I got to talk to you . Look , I hope you understand what I 'm gonna tell you . I don 't like it when you get serious . Yeah , well , this is serious . No , I can 't go on with this anymore . On with what ? Bell and Mabel . We got to find some other way to get the money for the telephone . Why ? Because I love Mabel , and she loves me . And I can 't give her up . I mean it , I 've never felt this way about anyone before . But we have a job to do . I know . We 'll figure some other way to get the money . No ! We can 't change history . Why am I telling you this ? You 're the one who 's always telling me . Bell and Mabel are supposed to get married . You don 't understand , I love her . I 've heard that one before . No , you haven 't . I 've fallen for a few in my time but I never said I loved any of them . So what do you plan to do , stop being a voyager , stay home and raise kids ? I know that sounds crazy , but right now that 's exactly what I feel like doing . No , Bogg , it doesn 't just sound crazy , it is crazy . Yeah , well , it 's hard traveling around all the time , you know . Just when I get close to somebody I got to leave again . I know , I get lonely , too . But like it or not we 've got the most important job in history . And if we don 't do that job , history is gonna change . Telephone won 't be invented , Eisenhower won 't be born and millions of other things will be different . You 're not telling me anything I haven 't already told myself . The fact is , kid , I don 't know what I 'm gonna do . ( VIBRATING ) Watson ! Watson , what are you doing ? I 'm plucking the reed free . Keep doing it , I can hear the vibrations . This is it ! It 's generating audible sounds . What 's going on ? I can hear the exact sound Watson is producing . I can hear its timbre . No less complex or subtle than the sound of symphonies . And speech . Yes . And speech . Does this mean you 've invented the phone ? No , no , I 'm afraid I 'm a long way from that . But this proves it will work . You mean , we finally made progress ? Good progress . We still need money for supplies . Without it , we 're not much further along . Yes , but now you can convince people . Now that this has happened ? No , they won 't know what this means , how much closer we are . The telephone has been born . But for a while , a long while , it will remain an infant . ( BEEPING ) Good morning , sweetheart . Is there something wrong ? With me ? No , no , couldn 't be better . So , where do you want to go for lunch ? Well , I really just came by to say I couldn 't go . What ? Why not ? I just have some things I got to do . But last night , we made plans . I know , I know , but things change . We 've seen too much of each other already . Well , it hasn 't been too much for me . See , that 's what I was afraid of . You 're getting too attached . Too attached ? Yeah , I mean I 'm not the kind of guy that gets serious . I like to stay loose , on the move . I don 't want any woman hanging on . But last night ... I mean , you said you loved me . Did I ? Well , I guess , I say that to a lot of girls . Oh , please , Phineas , don 't talk like this . It 's like I don 't even know you . Look , this is the real Phineas Bogg , okay ? I 'll say anything or do anything to get a girl interested . Please , Phineas , I know that 's not true . Well , face it , will you ? You 're just another pretty face to me . You don 't mean any more to me than the girl I met last week or the girl I 'll probably meet tomorrow . ( SOBBING ) Mabel , I hope someday you can forgive me . And I hope someday I can forget how much I love you . I 'm glad you came over , Mabel . Did you really mean all those things you said the other day ? Of course . I may not be much , but I am honest . I 'll be honest with you , too . I came over here today because someone I thought I really cared about hurt me badly . I understand . I just needed someone to lean on , a shoulder to cry on . You were the first person I thought of . I 'm glad you did , Mabel . Here 's my shoulder . It 's all yours . Come on . You did the right thing . I don 't know . If there was a medal for voyager action above and beyond the call of duty , you 'd deserve it . Thanks . ( DINGS ) Green light , let 's get out of here , huh ? We gotta see the telephone get invented . How long before that happens ? I think I remember from the late show it was sometime in March . Okay , we 'll Omni forward . But if Mabel 's there , I don 't think I 'll be able to stick around . It 's March , all right , and it 's coming in like a lion . Yeah , let 's get inside . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Well , I 'll be . We thought we lost you two forever . Aleck , look who 's here . Where have you two been ? We had to go away for a while . Well , I 'm glad you 're back . And I have great news . Mabel and I are engaged . Congratulations , that 's great . You 're a lucky man . You don 't have to tell me . And if it wasn 't for the two of you I never would have gotten to know her . Hey , did Mr. Hubbard finally come around and give you support ? You were right , Jeffrey , Mabel talked him into it . Great . Come , we were just about to try something new . Inside this cone I have placed a diaphragm much like the eardrum in your ear . When I talk into it , the vibrations are sent through this wire that sits in the water . That causes an electric current that varies and those variations are sent to the receiving diaphragm , reproducing the human voice . When you gonna try it ? Right now . Jeffrey , you and Watson go in the other room . Mr. Bogg , you can stay with me . Don 't get your hopes up too high , kid . This ain 't the first time we tried this . We 've been at this thing for three hours . It 's never going to work . Sure it is , it has to . Yeah , well , if a miracle happens you wake me up . I 'm gonna take a nap . I don 't understand , it should work . Why is the wire in the water ? Water acts as a conductor for the electricity . Maybe it 's not a good enough conductor . I can fix that .

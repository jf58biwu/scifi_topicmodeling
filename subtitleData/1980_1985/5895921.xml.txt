So , you think you found something more than an ordinary Trae ? Guess so . And the other ? - Phillip Eames I found it using a table with car that stopped last night in Hagedorn . He Hagedornov lawyer . You can see that all the time taken large amounts of money in a brokerage house . 10th May 29th $ 787,000 $ 644,000 in May 11th June $ 989,000 It seems that the Eames were making so as " wash anybody 's dirty laundry . " He is too rich for doing so . I do not believe his own laundry . I mean " wash " money . I agree . All that money comes from the billing Caymanskim Islands . This is one of the most notorious places for hiding illegal earnings . If you talk to these people , I will only interfere with your investigation , did not you ? Hagedorn was pretty withdrawn . One of the places where it can be seen 's on the set of the movie . While you are " attacking " directly , I will sideways . Well , it does not sound bad . Izve  tavajte me about this . Lieutenant Curtis seems satisfied I am in the movie . Good . As long as you investigation in the first place ... You 're playing it . Only Promise me that you will not be too zanese  .

You 're welcome , Lieutenant . I 'll get out . Yes . I understand that . Why do not you just said .. Who was it ? Would not say , but he gave me the information about the Gilletteovom murder . Do you think it 's real ? - Only one way to find out . To meet face to face . OK . Get out ! Nothing I could draw some of it . Why can not I just solve poverty ? I do not care how long will it last , must tell you everything he knows . I 'll give my best , sir . - Yes , do so . Poèeæu everything from the beginning . Saw all the reporters notes , is not it ? You know I did . Then we can tell you what was in them . Actually , I can . I have all the time in the world , pametnjakoviæu . A time is up to you . Hello , Phillip Eames here . I need Hagedorn . Hello , Michael . - Phil , just curious I visited Lieutenant Curtis . Only slowly . It 's a routine . They do it that way . Phil , listen to me . The cop knows all of the accounts on the Cayman . When I tell you , he knows everything . If you do not finish shooting until tomorrow in 18h , or will no longer be important . How 's the movie ? Is everything going according to plan ? If something catastrophic happens , uspeæemo . But if we fail , you 'll have problems Cassi to explain why you can not to pay him a commodity that commissioned . It will have you wait until the film is over . Thanks for your help , the course . So Jack did not tell you where he 's going ? Only going to meet with someone who has information Gillette case . If it is any consolation , I know that the agent is now seeking Mann Jack . Looking for him and all available men , but that does not mean that they will find him . No , I reported a problem with the phone . In the office you are wrong . This is me . Agent Man ? Found where you Jack ? No , but I discovered that he was alive . I found other things . To start , Hagedorn and his lawyer should take 20 kg of heroin soon . The only problem is that if you do not finish until tomorrow film naveèe , can not close the deal . What does drug trafficking with making movies ? If the movie is not over , Hagedorn will be done . This means we will have to assume the entire cost of the film itself . A then not be able to buy the drugs . It sounds crazy . Agent Mann , you still have a few to run scene in the movie , right ? Yes , why ? Then you just have to make sure you do not end . Odugovlaèite . Furious . Anything . But do not let me finish the film . How will that help ? Dobiæemo time . Not find the heroin . And hopefully Jack . I have tried to find out where they keep the Lieutenant Curtis , but a phone call from that place was not long enough . This I only managed to do . Only the first four digits . Well that 's something . So what are you waiting ! ? Go ! If not for 5 minutes , expel him from the film . Do that and I 'm gone . I 'm not going to do without him . Charming .

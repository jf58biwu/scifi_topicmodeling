 ( lNSTRUMENTS BEEPlNG ) SAAVlK : Captain 's Log , Stardate 81 30.3 . Starship Enterprise on training mission to Gamma Hydra , Section 14 , coordinates 22-87-4 . Approaching Neutral Zone . All systems normal - and functioning . - Leaving Section 14 for Section 1 5 . Stand by . Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone . SULU : Aye , Captain . Course change projected . Captain , I 'm getting something on the distress channel . On speakers . MAN : Imperative ! This is the Kobayashi Maru , 19 periods out of Altair VI . We have struck a gravitic mine and have lost all power . ( DISTORTED ) Our hull is penetrated and we have sustained many causalities ... This is the Starship Enterprise . Your message is breaking up . Can you give us your coordinates ? Repeat , this is the Starship ... Enterprise , ourposition is Gamma Hydra , Section 10 . ( static ) ln the Neutral Zone . Hull penetrated , life support systems failing . Can you assist us , Enterprise ? - Can you assist us ? - Data on Kobayashi Maru . COMPUTER VOICE : Subject vessel is third class neutronic fuel carrier , crew of 81 , 300 passengers . Damn . Mr Sulu ? Plot an intercept course . May I remind the Captain that if a starship enters the Zone ... I 'm aware of my responsibilities , Mister . SULU : Estimating two minutes to intercept . Now entering the Neutral Zone . COMPUTER VOICE : Warning . We have entered Neutral Zone . We are now in violation of treaty , Captain . Stand by , Transporter Room , ready to beam survivors aboard . Captain ! I 've lost their signal . COMPUTER VOICE : Alert . Sensors indicate three Klingon cruisers , bearing 3-1-6 mark 4 . - Closing fast . - Visual . Battle stations . Activate shields . ( ALARM blaring ) Shields activated . Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission . They 're jamming all the frequencies , Captain . COMPUTER VOICE : Klingons on attack course and closing . We 're over our heads . Mr Sulu , get us out of here . I 'll try , Captain . COMPUTER VOICE : Alert . Klingon torpedoes activated . - Alert . - Evasive action ! ( ALARM wailing ) Engineering , damage report . SCOTTY ON INTERCOM : Main energizer hit , Captain . Engage auxiliary power . Prepare to return fire . ( GROANS ) Shields collapsing , Captain . - Fire all phasers . - No power to the weapons , Captain . SCOTTY : Captain , it 's no use . We 're dead in space . ( explosion ) SAAVlK : Activate escape pods . Send out the log buoy . All hands abandon ship . - Repeat , all hands abandon ship . - kirk : All right . Open her up . ( ALARM blaring ) - Any suggestions , Admiral ? - kirk : Prayer , Mr Saavik . The Klingons don 't take prisoners . Lights . MAN ON PA : Motors on . Captain ? Trainees , to the briefing room . WOMAN ON PA : Maintenance crew , report to Bridge Simulator . Maintenance crew , report to Bridge Simulator . - " Physician , heal thyself . " - ls that all you 've got to say ? - What about my performance ? - l 'm not a drama critic . Well , Mr Saavik , are you gonna stay with the sinking ship ? - Permission to speak candidly , sir ? - Granted . SAAVlK : I don 't believe this was a fair test of my command abilities . - And why not ? - Because there was no way to win . A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face . - Has that never occurred to you ? - No , sir. lt has not . How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life , wouldn 't you say ? As I indicated , Admiral , that thought had not occurred to me . Well , now you have something new to think about . Carry on . WOMAN ON PA : Engineering cadets , assemble on C-Level . McCOY : Admiral . Wouldn 't it be easier to just put an experienced crew back on the ship ? Galloping around the cosmos is a game for the young , Doctor . Now , what is that supposed to mean ? Aren 't you dead ? I assume you 're loitering around here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets ? I am understandably curious . They destroyed the Simulator Room and you with it . The Kobayashi Maru scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment . As I recall , you took the test three times yourself . Your final solution was , shall we say , unique . It had the virtue of never having been tried . By the way , thank you for this . I know of your fondness for antiques . " lt was the best of times , it was the worst of times ... " - Message , Spock ? - None that I 'm conscious of . Except , of course , happy birthday . Surely the best of times . WOMAN ON PA : Captain Spock , Captain Spock , space shuttle leaving in 15 minutes . - Where are you off to now ? - The Enterprise . I must check in before your inspection . And you ? Home . ( DOORBELL dings ) kirk : Why , bless me , Doctor . What beams you into this neck of the woods ? Beware Romulans bearing gifts . - Happy birthday , Jim . - Thanks . Romulan ale . Why , Bones , you know this is illegal . I only use it for medicinal purposes . I got a border ship that brings me in a case every now and then across the Neutral Zone . - Now , don 't be a prig . - 2283 . Yeah , well , it takes this stuff a while to ferment . Here , give me . Now , you open this one . I 'm almost afraid to . What is it ? Klingon aphrodisiacs ? - No . - Bones , this is charming . For most patients your age , I usually recommend Retinax V. - l 'm allergic to Retinax . - Exactly . Cheers . Cheers . ( EXHALES ) Happy birthday . - l don 't know what to say . - Well , you could say thank you . Thank you . Damn it , Jim , what the hell 's the matter with you ? Other people have birthdays . Why are we treating yours like a funeral ? - Bones , I don 't want to be lectured . - What the hell do you want ? This is not about age and you know it . It 's about you flying a goddamn computer console when you want to be out there hopping galaxies . Spare me your notions of poetry , please . - We all have our assigned duties . - Bull ! You 're hiding , hiding behind rules and regulations . - Who am I hiding from ? - From yourself , Admiral . Don 't mince words , Bones . What do you really think ? Jim , I 'm your doctor and I 'm your friend . Get back your command . Get it back before you turn into part of this collection . Before you really do grow old . CHEKOV : Starship Log , Stardate 8130.4 . Log entry by First Officer Pavel Chekov . Starship Reliant on orbital approach to Ceti Alpha VI in connection with Project Genesis . We are continuing our search for a lifeless planet to satisfy the requirement of a test site for the Genesis experiment . So far , no success . Standard orbit , please . Mr Beach , any change in the surface scan ? Negative . Limited atmosphere dominated by craylon gas , sand , high-velocity winds . incapable of supporting life forms . Does it have to be completely lifeless ? Don 't tell me you found something . We 've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dynoscanner . Damn . Are you sure ? Maybe the scanner 's out of adjustment . I suppose it could be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix . All right . Get on the comm-pic to Dr Marcus . Aye , sir . Maybe it 's something we can transplant . You know what she 'll say . CAROL : Let me get this straight . Something you can transplant ? CHEKOV : Yes , Doctor . CAROL : Something you can transplant ? I don 't know . TERRELL : But it may only be a particle of preanimate matter . Then again , it may not . You boys have to be clear on this . There can 't be so much as a microbe , or the show 's off . ( sighs ) Why don 't you have a look ? But if it is something that can be moved , I want ... You bet , Doctor . We 're on our way . Well , don 't have kittens , Genesis is going to work . They 'll remember you in one breath with Newton , Einstein , Surak ! Thanks a lot . No respect from my offspring . Par for the course . Are you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner ? Maybe . What is it ? ( david sighing ) Every time we have dealings with Starfleet , I get nervous . We are dealing with something that could be perverted into a dreadful weapon . Remember that overgrown Boy Scout you used to hang around with ? - That 's exactly the kind of man ... - Listen , kiddo . Jim Kirk was many things , but he was never a Boy Scout . MAN ON RAIDO : Captain Terrell , stand by to beam down . ( air whooshing ) TERRELL ON radio : Chekov , are you sure these are the correct coordinates ? CHEKOV ON radio : Captain , this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI . ( TRlCORDER BEEPlNG ) TERRELL : I can barely see it . CHEKOV : There 's nothing here . The tricorder must be broken . ( CHEKOV SIGHS ) ( TRlCORDER BEEPlNG FASTER ) TERRELL : Chekov , overhere . Those look like cargo carriers . Hey , give me a hand . ( TRlCORDER BEEPlNG rapidly ) What the hell happened ? If they crashed , then where 's the rest of the ship ? What the hell is that ? Botany Bay . Botany Bay ? Oh , no ! We 've got to get out of here now . Damn . - What about the tricorder . - Hurry . Never mind that . Hurry . Hurry ! Chekov , what 's the matter with you ? Chekov ! CHEKOV : Come on ! Hurry ! Starship Reliant to Captain Terrell . This is Commander Kyle . Will you please respond , Captain ? Captain Terrell . Respond , please . Let 's give them a little more time . Khan . I don 't know you . But you ... I never forget a face . Mr Chekov , isn 't it ? I never thought to see your face again . - Chekov , who is this man ? - A criminal , Captain . A product of late 20th century genetic engineering . What do you want with us ? Sir , I demand to be ... You are in a position to demand nothing , sir . I , on the other hand , am in a position to grant nothing . What you see is all that remains of the ship 's company and crew of the Botany Bay , marooned here 1 5 years ago by Captain James T. Kirk . - Listen to me . You men and women ... - Captain , Captain , Captain . ( KHAN chuckling ) Save your strength , Captain . These people have sworn to live and die at my command 200 years before you were born . Do you mean he never told you the tale ? To amuse your captain ? No ? Never told you how the Enterprise picked up the Botany Bay , lost in space from the year 1 996 , myself and the ship 's company in cryogenic freeze ? - l 've never even met Admiral Kirk . - KHAN : Admiral ? Admiral . Never told you how Admiral Kirk sent 70 of us into exile on this barren sand heap , with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us ? You lie ! On Ceti Alpha V there was life ! - A fair chance . - This is Ceti Alpha V. Ceti Alpha Vl exploded six months after we were left here . The shock shifted the orbit of this planet and everything was laid waste . Admiral Kirk never bothered to check on our progress . It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that allowed us to survive . On Earth , two hundred years ago , I was a prince with power over millions . Captain Kirk was your host . You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him . You didn 't expect to find me . You thought this was Ceti Alpha Vl . Ah . Why are you here ? ( CHEKOV gasping ) Why ? Allow me to introduce you to Ceti Alpha V 's only remaining indigenous life form . ( CREATURE growling ) What do you think ? They killed 20 of my people , including my beloved wife . ( SCREECHlNG ) Not all at once and not instantly , to be sure . ( barking ) You see , their young enter through the ears and wrap themselves around the cerebral cortex . This has the effect of rendering the victim extremely susceptible to suggestion . Later , as they grow , follows madness and death . ( TERRELL GRUNTlNG ) CHEKOV : Khan , listen to me . These are pets , of course . Not quite domesticated . Khan , Captain Kirk was only doing his duty . TERRELL : No ! ( TERRELL moaning ) ( TERRELL AND CHEKOV screaming ) ( BOTH moaning ) That 's better . Now , tell me , why are you here ? And tell me where l may find James Kirk . MAN ON RADIO : Enterprise to Admiral Kirk 's shuttle . You 're cleared for docking . Approach portside torpedo bay . Enterprise , this is Admiral Kirk 's party on final approach . WOMAN ON radio : Enterprise welcomes you . Prepare for docking . kirk : I hate inspections . I 'm delighted . Any chance to go aboard the Enterprise . Well , I , for one , am glad to have you at the helm for three weeks . I don 't think these kids can steer . ( whistling ) Open the airlock . - Permission to come aboard , Captain . - Welcome , Admiral . I think you know my training crew . Certainly they have come to know you . Yes . We 've been through death and life together . Mr Scott , you old space dog . You 're well ? I had a wee bout , sir , but Dr McCoy pulled me through . - A wee bout of what ? - Shore leave , Admiral . Oh , yes . And who do we have here ? Midshipman , first class , Peter Preston , engineer 's mate , sir ! First training voyage , Mr Preston ? - Yes , sir ! - l see . Well , shall we start with the Engine Room ? SCOTTY : We 'll see you there , sir . And everything is in order . That 'll be a pleasant surprise , Mr Scott . I 'll see you on the Bridge , Admiral . Company dismissed . ( lN VULCAN ) Well , Mr Scott , are your cadets capable of handling a minor training cruise ? - Give the word , Admiral . - Mr Scott , the word is given . Aye , sir . Admiral , what about the rest of the inspection ? ( MOUTHlNG ) MAN ON RADIO : This is StarfIeet Operations . Enterprise is clear for departure . Admiral on the Bridge . WOMAN ON RADIO : Pre-stage flux chillers , port . MAN ON RADIO : On . WOMAN : Pre-stage flux chillers , starboard . MAN : On . WOMAN : Main stage flux chillers , port . MAN : Enabled . SAAVlK : Running lights on . WOMAN : Main stage flux chillers , starboard . MAN : Enabled . Very well , Mr Saavik . You may clear all moorings . SAAVlK : Aye , sir . - All moorings are clear , Captain . - Thank you . Lieutenant ? Have you ever piloted a starship out of space dock ? Never , sir . Take her out , Mr Saavik . Aye , sir . For everything , there is a first time , Lieutenant . Don 't you agree , Admiral ? kirk : Mmm-hmm . - Aft thrusters , Mr Sulu . - SULU : Aft thrusters . Would you like a tranquilliser ? SAAVlK : Ahead one-quarter impulse power . Ahead one-quarter impulse power . We are free and clear to navigate . Course heading , Captain ? - Captain 's discretion . - Mr Sulu , you may indulge yourself . Aye , sir . Does that about do it ? I don 't think there 's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks . - Next time , we 'll design a bigger one . - Who 'd wanna build it ? Dr Marcus ? Comm-pic coming in on hyperchannel . - lt 's the Starship Reliant . - On the screen , please , Jedda . Come in , please . This is the Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat , this is U.S.S. Reliant . CAROL : Commander , we are receiving . This is Regula I . Go ahead . Dr Marcus . Good . We 're en route to you and should be there in three days . En route ? Why ? We weren 't expecting you for another three months . - Has something happened ? - Nothing has happened . Ceti Alpha VI has checked out . - Then I don 't understand why you ... - We have received new orders . Upon our arrival at Regula I , all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing on Ceti Alpha VI . - Who in the hell do they think they are ? - Please be quiet . Commander Chekov , this is completely irregular . - I have my orders . - Pin him down , Mother . Who gave the order ? The order comes from Admiral James T. Kirk . I knew it ! I knew it ! All along , the military 's wanted to get ... This is completely improper , Commander Chekov . I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorised personnel access to our work or materials . I 'm sorry that you feel that way , Doctor . Admiral Kirk 's orders are confirmed . Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival . Reliant out . Well done , Commander . You realise , sir , they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order . SAAVlK : Hold , please . Thank you , sir . Lieutenant , are you wearing your hair differently ? It 's still regulation , Admiral . May I speak , sir ? Self-expression doesn 't seem to be one of your problems . You 're bothered by your performance on the Kobayashi Maru . I failed to resolve the situation . There 's no correct resolution . It 's a test of character . May I ask how you dealt with the test ? You may ask . That 's a little joke . Humour. lt is a difficult concept . It is not logical . We learn by doing . Who 's been holding up the damn elevator ? Thank you , sir . - Did she change her hairstyle ? - l hadn 't noticed . Wonderful stuff , that Romulan ale . UHURA ON INTERCOM : Admiral Kirk ? Kirk here . I have an urgent comm-pic from Space Lab Regula I for you , sir . Dr Carol Marcus . - l 'll take it in my quarters , Uhura . - UHURA : Aye , sir . It never rains , but it pours . As a physician , you of all people should appreciate the dangers of re-opening old wounds . Sorry . CAROL : Jim , can you read me ? I can hear you , Carol . What 's wrong ? What 's the matter ? Why are you taking Genesis away from us ? Taking Genesis ? Who 's taking Genesis ? Who is taking Genesis ? - I can see you , but I can 't hear . - Carol ... Jim , did you give the order ? What order ? Who 's taking Genesis ? Please help us , Jim . I will not let them have Genesis without proper authorisation ! - Have Genesis ? Who 's taking ... - On whose authority can they do this ? - No one 's authority ! - ( DISTORTED ) Jim , please ... Uhura , what 's happening ? UHURA : Transmission jammed at the source , sir . - Alert Starfleet Headquarters . - UHURA : Aye , sir . I want to talk to Starfleet Command . CAROL : Quiet . We must have order in here . This has to be some sort of mistake . david : Mistake ! We 're all alone here . They waited until everyone was on leave to do this . Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal , not vice-versa . It seems clear Starfleet never intended ... CAROL : I know that , but ... MAN : David , you were right . david : I tried to tell you before . Scientists have always been pawns of the military . Starfleet has kept the peace for 1 00 years . I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event . You may be right , Doctor . But what about Reliant ? She 's on her way . kirk : We have a problem . Something may be wrong on Regula I . We 've been ordered to investigate . If memory serves , Regula I is a scientific research laboratory . I told Starfleet Command all we had was a boatload of children , but we 're the only ship in the quadrant . Spock , these cadets of yours , how good are they ? How will they respond under real pressure ? As with all living things , each according to his gifts . Of course , this ship is yours . No , that won 't be necessary . Just get me to Regula I . As a teacher on a training mission , I 'm content to command the Enterprise . If we are to go on actual duty , it is clear that the senior officer onboard must assume command . It may be nothing . Garbled communications . - You take the ship . - Jim . You proceed from a false assumption . I 'm a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise . You 're about to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions ? I would not remind you of that which you know so well . If I may be so bold , it was a mistake for you to accept promotion . Commanding a starship is your first , best destiny . Anything else is a waste of material . I would not presume to debate you . That is wise . In any case , were I to invoke logic , logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few . Or the one . You are my superior officer . You are also my friend . I have been and always shall be yours . - Stop energizers . - SULU : Stop energizers . Put me on speakers . An emergency situation has arisen . By order of Starfleet Command , as of now , 1 800 hours , I 'm assuming command of this vessel . Duty officer , so note in the ship 's log . Plot a new course for Space Laboratory Regula I . Engine Room . - Mr Scott . - SCOTTY ON INTERCOM : Aye , sir ? - We 'll be going to warp speed . - Aye , sir . - Course plotted for Regula I , Admiral . - kirk : Engage warp engines . - Prepare for warp speed . - Ready , sir . I know that none of you were expecting this. I 'm sorry . I 'm going to have to ask you to grow up a little bit sooner than you expected . Warp 5 , Sulu . So much for the little training cruise . WOMAN : Course to intercept Enterprise ready , sir . KHAN : Excellent . - Helmsman ? - Sir , may I speak ? We 're all with you , sir . But consider this . We are free . We have a ship and the means to go where we will . We have escaped permanent exile on Ceti Alpha V. You have proved your superior intellect and defeated the plans ofAdmiral Kirk . You do not need to defeat him again . He tasks me . He tasks me and I shall have him . I 'll chase him round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom and round perdition 's flames before I give him up . Prepare to alter course . UHURA : Space Station Regula I , please come in . Dr Marcus , please respond . This is Enterprise ... lt 's no use . There 's no response from Regula I . - But no longerjammed ? - No , sir . No nothing . There are two possibilities . They are unable to respond . They are unwilling to respond . - How far ? - 1 2 hours , 43 minutes , present speed . " Give up Genesis , " she said . What in God 's name does it mean ? Give it up to whom ? It might help my analysis if I knew what Genesis was , beyond the biblical reference . Uhura , have Dr McCoy join us in my quarters . UHURA : Aye , sir . kirk : Mr Saavik ? You have the conn . Well , I 've got Sickbay ready . Now , will someone please tell me what 's going on ? Computer . Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis summary . COMPUTER VOICE : Identify for retina scan . Kirk , Admiral James T. - Security Scan approved . - Summary , please ? Project Genesis . A proposal to the Federation . - Carol Marcus . - Yes . What exactly is Genesis ? Well , put simply , Genesis is life from lifelessness . It is a process whereby molecular structure is reorganised at the subatomic level into life-generating matter of equal mass . Stage one of our experiments was conducted in the laboratory . Stage two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground . Stage three will involve the process on a planetary scale . It is our intention to introduce the Genesis device into a preselected area of a lifeless space body , a moon or other dead form . The device is delivered , instantaneously causing what we call the Genesis Effect . Matter is reorganised with life-generating results . Instead of a dead moon , a living , breathing planet capable of sustaining whatever life forms we see fit to deposit on it . Fascinating . The reformed moon simulated here represents the merest fraction of the Genesis ' potential , should the Federation wish to fund these experiments to their logical conclusion . When we consider the cosmic problems of population and food supply , the usefulness of this process becomes clear . This concludes our proposal . Thank you for your attention . It literally is genesis . Power of creation . Have they proceeded with their experiments ? kirk : Well , the tape was made about a year ago , so I can only assume they 've reached stage two by now . Dear Lord , do you think we 're intelligent enough to ... Suppose ... What if this thing were used where life already exists ? It would destroy such life in favour of its new matrix . Its new matrix ? Do you have any idea what you 're saying ? I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications , Doctor . As a matter of cosmic history , it has always been easier to destroy than to create . Not any more ! Now we can do both at the same time . According to myth , the Earth was created in six days . Now , watch out . Here comes Genesis . We 'll do it for you in six minutes . Really , Dr McCoy , you must learn to govern your passions . They will be your undoing . Logic suggests ... Logic ? My God , the man 's talking about logic . We 're talking about universal Armageddon . - You green-blooded , inhuman ... - SAAVIK : Bridge to Admiral Kirk . Admiral , sensors indicate a vessel in our area , closing fast . - What do you make of her ? - It 's one of ours , Admiral . It 's Reliant . SPOCK : Reliant ? Try the emergency channels . Picture , Mr Saavik . KHAN : Slow to one-half impulse power . - Let 's be friends . - Slowing to one-half impulse power . Reliant in our section , this quadrant , sir , and slowing . Sir ? May I quote General Order 1 2 ? " On the approach of any vessel " when communications have not been established ... " Lieutenant . The Admiral is well aware of the regulations . Aye , sir . kirk : is it possible their comm system has failed ? SPOCK : It would explain a great many things . They 're requesting communications , sir . Let them eat static . joachim : They 're still running with shields down . Of course . We are one big happy fleet . ( sighs LOUDLY ) Kirk , my old friend . Do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us , " Revenge is a dish that is best served cold ? " It is very cold in space . This is damn peculiar . - Yellow alert . - Energize defence fields . ( ALARM blaring ) I 'm getting a voice message . They say their chambers coil is overloading their comm system . - Spock ? - Scanning . Their coil emissions are normal . - They still haven 't raised their shields . - Raise ours . Their shields are going up . Lock phasers on target . Locking phasers on target . - They 're locking phasers . - Raise shields . Fire ! - Sulu , get those shields up . - Trying , sir . MAN : I can 't breathe. I can 't breathe . ( CREW CLAMOURlNG ) MAN : I need air ! I need air ! I can 't get power , sir . Scotty ? - Uhura , turn off those damn channels ! - Mr Scott on the screen . We 're just hanging on , sir . The main energizer 's out . - KIRK : Try auxiliary power ! - Aye , aye , sir . Damage report . They knew exactly where to hit us . Who ? Who knew where to hit us ? And why ? One thing is certain . We cannot escape on auxiliary power . Visual . - Sulu , divert all power to phasers . - SPOCK : Too late . Hang on ! kirk : Scotty ! What 's left ? SCOTTY : Just the batteries , sir . I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes . We don 't have a few minutes ! - Can you give me phaser power ? - A few shots , sir . - Not enough against their shields . - Who the hell are they ? UHURA : Admiral , the Commander of the Reliant is signalling . He wishes to discuss terms of our surrender . - Put it on screen . - UHURA : Admiral ... Do it ! While we still have time . UHURA : On screen , sir . - Khan . - You still remember , Admiral . I cannot help but be touched . I , of course , remember you . What is the meaning of this attack ? Where is the crew of the Reliant ? Surely I have made my meaning plain . I mean to avenge myself upon you , Admiral . I 've deprived your ship of power , and when I swing around , I mean to deprive you of your life . But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you . Khan , if it 's me you want , I 'll have myself beamed aboard . Spare my crew . I make you a counterproposal . I 'll agree to your terms if , in addition to yourself , you hand over to me all data and material regarding the project called Genesis . - Genesis ? What 's that ? - Don 't insult my intelligence , Kirk . Give me some time to recall the data on our computers . I give you 60 seconds , Admiral . kirk : Clear the Bridge . At least we know he doesn 't have Genesis . Keep nodding as though I 'm still giving orders . Mr Saavik , punch up the data charts of Reliant 's command console . Reliant 's command ? - Hurry ! - 45 seconds . - The prefix code ? - That 's all we 've got . SAAVlK : The chart 's up , sir . KHAN : Admiral . We 're finding it . Admiral . kirk : Please . Please , you 've gotta give us time . The Bridge is smashed . The computer 's inoperative . Time is a luxury you don 't have , Admiral . Damn ! - Admiral ? - lt 's coming through now , Khan . - Reliant 's prefix number is 1 6309 . - l don 't understand . You have to learn why things work on a starship . Each ship has its own combination code to prevent an enemy from doing what we 're attempting . We 're using our console to order Reliant to lower her shields . Assuming he hasn 't changed the combination . He 's quite intelligent . Fifteen seconds , Admiral . Khan , how do we know you 'll keep your word ? I 've given you no word to keep , Admiral . In myjudgement , you simply have no alternative . I see your point . Stand by to receive our transmission . Mr Sulu , lock the phasers on target and await my command . Phasers locked . - Time 's up , Admiral . - Here it comes . Now , Mr Spock . ( BEEPlNG ) Sir , our shields are dropping . - Raise them . - l can 't ! Where 's the override ? The override ? Fire . Fire ! Fire ! - We can 't fire , sir . - Why can 't you ? They 've damaged the photon control and the warp drive . We must withdraw . - No ! No ! - Sir , we must ! Enterprise can wait . She 's not going anywhere . - SULU : Sir , you did it . - l did nothing . Except get caught with my breeches down . I must be getting senile . Mr Saavik , you go right on quoting regulations . In the meantime , let 's find out how badly we 've been hurt . ( DOOR opening ) ( UHURA GASPS ) - ls the word given , Admiral ? - The word is given . Warp speed . PRESTON : Aye . ( PRESTON sighing ) ( sobbing ) He stayed at his post when the trainees ran . SPOCK ON INTERCOM : Admiral ? This is Spock . Yes , Spock ? Engine Room reports auxiliary power restored . We can proceed at impulse power . Best speed to Regula I . Kirk out . I 'm sorry , Scotty . SULU : Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I. UHURA : Space Station Regula I , this is the Starship Enterprise . Please come in . Space Station Regula I , do you read ? Space Station Regula I , this is Enterprise . Please acknowledge . This is Enterprise . Do you read me ? Space Station Regula I , do you read ? Please come in . There 's no response , sir . Sensors , Captain ? The scanners and sensors are still inoperative . There 's no way to ascertain what 's inside the station . No way of telling if Reliant is still in the area . Precisely . kirk : What do you make of that planetoid beyond ? SPOCK : Regula is Class-D . It consists of various unremarkable ores , essentially a great rock in space . And Reliant could be hiding behind that rock . A distinct possibility . - Engineering . - SCOTTY : Aye , sir ? Mr Scott ? Do you have enough power for transporters ? Barely , sir . - kirk : I 'm going down there . - Khan could be down there . He 's been there , hasn 't found what he wants . Can you spare someone ? There may be people hurt . - Yeah , I can spare me . - SAAVlK : Begging the Admiral 's pardon . General Order 1 5 , " No flag officer shall beam " into a hazardous area without armed escort . " There 's no such regulation . All right , join the party . Mr Spock , the ship is yours . - Jim , be careful . - We will . ( TRlCORDER BEEPlNG ) lndeterminate life signs . Phasers on stun . Move out . ( SOFT SCUFFLlNG ) ( GASPS ) Jim ! Well , rigor hasn 't set in . This couldn 't have happened too long ago , Jim . Carol . This is Enterprise calling Space Lab Regula I . Respond , please . SAAVlK : Admiral , over here . UHURA : Dr Marcus , come in , please . Oh , my God . Please acknowledge signal . - Please ... - SAAVIK : Commander Uhura , this is Lieutenant Saavik . We 're all right . Please stand by . Out . Oh , sir , it was Khan . - We found him on Ceti Alpha V. - Easy . Easy , Pav . He put creatures in our bodies to control our minds . McCOY : It 's all right . You 're safe now . Made us say lies , do things . But we beat him . He thought he controlled us , but he did not . - The Captain was strong . - Captain . Where 's Dr Marcus ? Where are the Genesis materials ? He couldn 't find them . Even the data banks were empty . - Erased ? - He tortured those people , but none of them would tell him anything . He went wild . He slit their throats . He wanted to tear the place apart . But he was late . He had to get back to the Reliant in time to blow you to bits . Where 's Reliant 's crew ? Dead ? Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He 's completely mad , Admiral . He blames you for the death of his wife . I know what he blames me for . The escape pods are all in place . Where 's the Transporter Room ? - Did he make it down here ? - lt was not my impression . He spent most of his time trying to wring the information out of the people . SAAVlK : Anything ? kirk : The unit 's been left on . Which means nobody remained to turn it off . Those people back there bought escape time for Genesis with their lives . This is not logical . These coordinates are deep inside Regula , a planetoid we know to be lifeless . If stage two was completed , it was going to be underground . It was going to be underground , she said . SAAVlK : Stage two of what ? - Kirk to Enterprise . - SPOCK : Spock here . Captain Spock , damage report . Admiral , if we go by the book , like Lieutenant Saavik , hours could seem like days . - l read you , Captain . Let 's have it . - The situation is grave , Admiral . We won 't have main power for six days . Auxiliary power has temporarily failed . Restoration may be possible in two days , by the book , Admiral . - Meaning you can 't even beam us back ? - Not at present . Captain Spock. lf you don 't hear from us within one hour , your orders are to restore what power you can , take the Enterprise to the nearest starbase and alert Starfleet Command as soon as you 're out ofjamming range . UHURA : Sir , we won 't leave you behind . Uhura , if you don 't hear from us , there won 't be anybody behind . Kirk out . Well , gentlemen , you can stay here , or ... lf it 's all the same , Admiral , we 'd like to share the risk . Right . Let 's go . Saavik ? - Go ? Where are we going ? - Where they went . Suppose they went nowhere ? Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all . Admiral . Genesis , I presume . ( RATTLlNG ) - Phasers down . - david : You . - Where 's Dr Marcus ? - david : I 'm Dr Marcus . CAROL : Jim ! is that David ? Mother , he killed everybody we left behind . Of course he didn 't . David , you 're just making this harder . I 'm afraid it 's even harder than you think , Doctor . Please don 't move . - Chekov . - l 'm sorry , Admiral . Your Excellency , have you been listening ? I have indeed , Captain . You have done well . I knew it ! You son of a bitch ! ( JEDDA SCREAMS ) - Don 't move ! Anybody ! - Captain ? We are waiting . What 's the delay ? All is well , sir . You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis . First things first , Captain . Kill Admiral Kirk . Sir , it is difficult. I ... - I try to obey , but ... - Kill him . I ... ( CREATURE screeching ) ( screaming ) Kill him , Terrell , now . ( TERRELL SCREAMS ) ( CREATURE screeching ) ( MOANlNG ) ( CHEKOV SCREAMS ) ( SCREECHlNG ) God 's sakes ! david : What is it ? ( SCREECHlNG ) Khan , you bloodsucker ! You 're gonna have to do your own dirty work now . Do you hear me ? Do you ? Kirk . Kirk , you 're still alive , my old friend . Still , old friend , you 've managed to kill just about everyone else , but like a poor marksman , you keep missing the target . Perhaps I no longer need to try , Admiral . - Oh , no . - david : Let go . He can 't take it ! Khan . Khan , you 've got Genesis , but you don 't have me . You were going to kill me , Khan . You 're gonna have to come down here . You 're going to have to come down here . I 've done far worse than kill you . I 've hurt you , and I wish to go on hurting you . I shall leave you as you left me , as you left her , marooned for all eternity in the centre of a dead planet . Buried alive . Buried alive . Khan ! Khan ! This is Lieutenant Saavik calling Enterprise . Can you read us ? - He 's coming around . - kirk : Pavel ? Can you read us ? It 's no use , Admiral . They 're still jamming all channels . If Enterprise followed orders , she 's long since gone . If she couldn 't obey , she 's finished . So are we , it looks like . I don 't understand . Who 's responsible for all this ? Who is Khan ? - Well , it 's a long story . - We appear to have plenty of time . is there anything to eat ? I don 't know about anybody else , but I 'm starved . How can you think of food at a time like this ? First order of business , survival . There 's food in the Genesis cave . Enough to last a lifetime , if necessary . - We thought this was Genesis . - This ? ( SCOFFS ) lt took the Starfleet Corps of Engineers 1 0 months in spacesuits to tunnel out all this . What we did in there , we did in a day . David , why don 't you show Dr McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food ? We can 't just sit here . Oh , yes , we can . This is just to give us something to do , isn 't it ? Come on . Admiral ? As your teacher Mr Spock is fond of saying , " l 'd like to think that there always are possibilities . " I did what you wanted. I stayed away . Why didn 't you tell him ? ( sighing ) How can you ask me that ? Were we together ? Were we going to be ? You had your world and I had mine , and I wanted him in mine , not chasing through the universe with his father . Actually , he 's a lot like you in many ways . Please tell me what you 're feeling . There 's a man out there I haven 't seen in 1 5 years who 's trying to kill me . You show me a son that 'd be happy to help him . My son . My life that could have been and wasn 't . What am I feeling ? Old . Worn out . Let me show you something that 'll make you feel young , as when the world was new . Impulse power restored . Excellent . More than a match for poor Enterprise . You did all this in a day ? The matrix formed in a day . The life forms grew later at a substantially accelerated rate . McCOY : Jim , this is incredible ! Have you ever seen the like ? Can I cook or can 't I ? Where is she ? SAAVlK : Sir , may I ask you a question ? - What 's on your mind , Lieutenant ? - The Kobayashi Maru , sir . Are you asking me if we 're playing out that scenario now ? On the test , sir , will you tell me what you did ? I would really like to know . Lieutenant , you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario . How ? I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship . - What ? - He cheated . I changed the conditions of the test . I got a commendation for original thinking . I don 't like to lose . Then you never faced that situation , faced death ? I don 't believe in the no-win scenario . Kirk to Spock. lt 's two hours . Are you ready ? SPOCK : Right on schedule , Admiral . Just give us your coordinates and we 'll beam you aboard . All right . I don 't like to lose . SAAVlK : ... report , we were immobilised . Captain Spock said it 'd be two days . kirk : Come , come , Lieutenant . You of all people go by the book . Spock ! - You know Dr Marcus . - SPOCK : Why , of course . Hello , Mr Spock . McCOY : I 'm taking this bunch to Sickbay . - SAAVlK : By the book ? - By the book . Regulation 46A . " lf transmissions are being monitored during battle ... " No un-coded messages on an open channel . " - You lied . - l exaggerated . Hours instead of days . Now we have minutes instead of hours . - They 're inoperative below C-Deck . - What is working around here ? Not much , Admiral . We have partial main power . kirk : That 's it ? SPOCK : Best we could do in two hours . - SULU : Admiral on the Bridge . - Battle stations . ( ALARM wailing ) Tactical . Uh-oh . SPOCK : She can still outrun us and outgun us , but there is the Mutara Nebula at 1 - 5-3 mark 4 . kirk : Scotty , can we make it inside ? The energizer 's bypassed like a Christmas tree , so don 't give me too many bumps . No promises . On your way . Trouble with the nebula , sir , is all that static discharge and gas clouds our tactical display . Visual won 't function and shields will be useless . Sauce for the goose , Mr Saavik . The odds will be even . ( CREW chattering ) There she is . There she is . Ah . Not so wounded as we were led to believe . So much the better . Estimating nebula penetration in 2.2 minutes . Reliant is closing . ( THUNDER rumbling ) lf they go in there , we 'll lose them . KHAN : Explain it to them . ( explosion ) That was close . kirk : They just don 't want us going in there . One minute to nebula perimeter . Why are we slowing ? Daren 't follow them into the nebula , sir . Our shields would be useless . - They are reducing speed . - Uhura , patch me in . UHURA : Aye , sir . You 're on , Admiral . KIRK ON RADIO : This is Admiral Kirk . We tried it once your way , Khan . Are you game for a rematch ? Khan , I 'm laughing at the superior intellect . - Full impulse power . - No , sir . You have Genesis . You can have whatever you ... Full power ! Damn you ! I 'll say this for him , he 's consistent . We are now entering the Mutara Nebula . kirk : Emergency lights . ( rumbling ) Tactical . inoperative . KHAN : Raise the shields . As I feared , sir , not functional . I 'm reducing speed . ( THUNDER rumbling ) MAN : Target , sir . Phaser lock inoperative , sir . kirk : Best guess , Mr Sulu . Fire when ready . ( GRUNTlNG ) Aft torpedoes , fire ! Hold your course . Evasive starboard ! Fire ! ( MEN screaming ) KIRK : Damage , Mr Scott ? Admiral , I 've got to take the mains off the line . - lt 's the radiation ... - Scotty . KHAN : Joachim ! Yours is superior ... I shall avenge you . Could you use another hand , Admiral ? Man the weapons console , Mr Chekov . - Spock . - SPOCK : Sporadic energy readings . Port side , aft . Could be an impulse turn . He won 't break off now . He followed me this far , he 'll be back . But from where ? He 's intelligent but not experienced . His pattern indicates two-dimensional thinking . - Full stop . - Full stop , sir . Z-minus 1 0,000 metres . Stand by photon torpedoes . Torpedoes ready , sir . Look sharp . Fire ! Uhura , send to Commander Reliant , " Prepare to be boarded . " UHURA : Aye , sir . Commander Reliant , this is Enterprise . Surrender and prepare to be boarded . Enterprise to Reliant . You are ordered to surrender your vessel . Respond . Reliant , come in , Reliant . You are ordered to surrender your vessel . Enterprise to Reliant . You are ordered to surrender your vessel . Respond . No , Kirk . The game 's not over . " To the last I will grapple with thee . " ( ringing ) Admiral , scanning an energy source on Reliant , a pattern I 've never seen before . - lt 's the Genesis wave . - What ? david : They 're on a build-up to detonation . - How soon ? - We encoded four minutes . - We 'll beam aboard and stop it . - You can 't . Scotty , I need warp speed in three minutes or we 're all dead . UHURA : No response , Admiral . kirk : Scotty ! Mr Sulu , get us out of here . Best possible speed . SULU : Aye , sir . Are you out of your Vulcan mind ? No human can tolerate the radiation that 's in there . As you are so fond of observing , Doctor , I am not human . You 're not going in there . Perhaps you 're right . What is Mr Scott 's condition ? Well , I don 't think that he ... I 'm sorry , Doctor . I have no time to discuss this logically . Remember . Spock ! Get out of there ! Spock ! Spock ! Get out of there ! - Time from my mark ? - Two minutes , 1 0 seconds . Engine Room , what 's happening ? Spock ! SCOTTY : Spock ! Get out of there ! McCOY : Good God , man , get out of there ! SCOTTY : No ! Don 't ! Don 't ! McCOY : Spock ! Spock ! ( WHOOSHlNG ) Time ? Three minutes , 30 seconds . - Distance from Reliant ? - 4,000 kilometres . We 're not gonna make it , are we ? No . No , you can 't get away . " From hell 's heart I stab at thee . " For hate 's sake I spit my last breath at thee . " - Sir , the mains are back online . - Bless you , Scotty . Go , Sulu ! My God , Carol . Look at it . Engine Room . Well done , Scotty . McCOY : Jim , I think you 'd better get down here . - Bones ? - Better hurry . Saavik , take the conn . No ! You 'll flood the whole compartment . - He 'll die . - Sir , he 's dead already . It 's too late . Spock ! ( HOARSELY ) Ship out of danger ? Yes . Don 't grieve , Admiral . It is logical . The needs of the many outweigh ... - The needs of the few . - Or the one . I never took the Kobayashi Maru test . Until now . What do you think of my solution ? Spock . I have been , and always shall be , your friend . Live long and prosper . No . kirk : We are assembled here today to pay final respects to our honoured dead . And yet it should be noted that , in the midst of our sorrow , this death takes place in the shadow of new life , the sunrise of a new world , a world that our beloved comrade gave his life to protect and nourish . He did not feel this sacrifice a vain or empty one , and we will not debate his profound wisdom at these proceedings . Of my friend , I can only say this . Of all the souls I have encountered in my travels , ( SOBS ) his was the most human . SULU : Honours ! ( SCOTTY playing AMAZING GRACE ON bagpipe ) ( KNOCK AT DOOR ) Come . I don 't mean to intrude . No , not at all. I should be on the Bridge . Can I talk to you for a minute ? I poured myself a drink . Would you like it ? Lieutenant Saavik was right . You never have faced death . No , not like this . I haven 't faced death . I 've cheated death . I 've tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity . I know nothing . You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life . - Just words . - But good words . That 's where ideas begin . Maybe you should listen to them . I was wrong about you and I 'm sorry . - ls that what you came here to say ? - Mainly . And also that I 'm proud , very proud to be your son . KIRK : Captain 's Log , Stardate 8141 .6 . Starship Enterprise departing for Ceti Alpha V to pick up the crew of U.S.S. Reliant . All is well . And yet , I can 't help wondering about the friend I leave behind . " There are always possibilities , " Spock said . And if Genesis is indeed life from death , I must return to this place again . He 's really not dead , as long as we remember him . " lt 's a far , far better thing I do than I have ever done before . " A far better resting place I go to " than I have ever known . " is that a poem ? Something Spock was trying to tell me on my birthday . You okay , Jim ? How do you feel ? Young . ( lNHALES ) I feel young . SPOCK : Space , the final frontier . These are the continuing voyages ofthe Starship Enterprise . Her ongoing mission , to explore strange new worlds , to seek out new life forms and new civilisations ,

 Tomorrow is today only tomorrow . Slawomir Mrozek , 1981 . Unauthorized personnel are requested to leave the first security zone . I repeat , unauthorized personnel are requested to leave the first security zone . We 're going inside . You can relax security . That 's a bad omen . No ... sometimes it just cracks ... internal pressure ... Let 's go , or the bad luck will fall on us . Ladies and gentlemen . A new day has begun , August 9th , 1991 . I urge you to remember this day , as it will , no doubt , go down in the history of the human race . And here 's the man who invented immortality , the Nobel Laureate , Professor Dr. Victor Kuppelweiser . Welcome to our studio , Professor . Immortality might be exaggerated , what lve done is put an organism in a state of anabiosis , or hibernation . Exactly . I would like to add that the Professors last experiment , freezing a chimp for six months , was a complete success . Excuse me , unfreezing . Now , allow me introduce , Mr. Albert Starski - and Mr. Maximilian ... ... Paradys . These two handsome and brave men will soon be locked in containers , not unlike 21 st century sarcophagi . Excuse me ! These are hibernators and not sarcophagi . Exactly . And in three years , they will wake up as living proof of the victory of the human mind over nature . What drew you to this freezing experiment , gentlemen ? In a nutshell , responsibility . As a biologist , I have the opportunity to serve mankind . I know these are big words , but thats what I believe . Thanks to hibernation , people who are incurably sick , will be able to live in times in which they can be cured . Our son is really famous , now . Like Gagarin and such . I 've always been attracted to danger , the unknown . Adventure . Hibernation has always fascinated me ... Admit it , you rat , this is all about the money . And a chance to ditch us . That rat is your daddy . Remember him well . ... I volunteered , and was selected . Thank you , very much . Any final words ? Speaking for both of us , I would like to say hello to all the hibernation enthusiasts from around the world . And one last question gentlemen : Are you not afraid ? Of what ? Yes , indeed . The method has been proven . Koko 's here with us . Yes , just so everything is clear , there is still a risk involved . Excuse me ? We can 't fully deduce the effects on the human body , based on animal experiments alone . We don 't know the effect on the pituitary gland . After the experiment , there might be some hallucinations . So lets go to this den of knowledge which , just as in Arabian Nights , will swallow our heroes , and in three years , at the sound of open sesame , will disgorge them , hopefully safe and sound . I would also like to remind you , that in three days , we will meet at the World Women 's League . The League advises , shields , and never yields . Thank you , and good night . SEXMISSION Screenplay Starring Music Photography Directed by I can 't see anything ! That 's normal after hibernation . All over ? Yes , it is . Thank you . Thank you , I can 't see anything . It worked . - It did . Didn 't I say so ? Wham , bam , thank you maam ! Darkness , I see darkness ! I see only darkness ! I 'm sweating like a pig . How about you ? The organisms adjusting . Its quite normal . You 're right . A typical , post-hibernation reaction . Good morning . What pleasant service ! Breakfast . Thank you . I haven 't eaten anything in three years . Croissants , eggs . How nice . Excuse me . The bread is stale . Hows that ? Oh , of course ! How ingenious ! Thank you . I 've lost my sense of taste . Its completely tasteless . You 're on an adaptation diet . Oh , I see . I feel sick . If I don 't smoke soon ... Wait a minute ... Here they are ! Extremely irresponsible . Forgive me for offering one . We can 't smoke here , anyway . No ashtrays . We never noticed . No one can see us anyway . But only for company . There you go . You see , I don 't usually smoke . Its bad for my health . But now , after that food ... We have no matches . It works ! That 's exactly what I needed . A good cigarette . Cigarette ... You see , I think smoking has gotten a bad reputation . I started when I was six , and I 'm still alive . Cigarette : Narcotic of plant origin ; carcinogenic . Eliminated in 1996 . They could start a fire . Maybe we shouldn 't be smoking ? Since were in quarantine . You just wait . Everything will start in a few days . Interviews , autographs , all sorts of meetings ! You 'll get bored of it Oh , how rude of me . Here you go . Good morning . I believe this is a non-smoking area . Professor Kuppelweiser ? - Yes . Winner of the so-called Nobel Prize ? Yes . He doesn 't exist . Yes . What ? Excuse me ? What 's going on here , sister ? The experiment worked , right ? Were heroes , right ? I was covered in foam , right ? So what 's all of this about ? I would like to see your superior . You should both be happy that you 're alive and that you were unfrozen . What 's the point of leaving us frozen ? The experiment would have been useless . There were more important things during the war than experiments . What war ? We were supposed to be unfrozen no matter what the political situation might have been . I don 't care about your war . Ours ? It 's yours . We don 't have war . - She 's crazy . And who won ? What ? The war ! Who won it ? It doesn 't matter who won but who survived . Excuse me , Miss , where is Professor Kuppelweiser ? Dr. Lamia already told you . That he doesn 't exist ? What exactly does that mean ? Did he have an accident ? Like all the others ? Excuse me , we would like to see the director of this facility . I 'm listening . I would rather speak with a man . They don 't understand any of it , sister . Contact with a member of your sex is ... not feasible . Not what ? You are the only males in existence . Men have long been extinct . Extinct ? They weren 't Mammoths ! It seems they were . In a manner of speaking . What is the date ? March 8th . You slept a little longer than planned . Longer than three years ? Five ? - No . - Four ? I 've seen her before somewhere . Excuse me , Doctor , I don 't really care . I had a contract for three years , now you 'll have to pay . - Overtime ! So what 's the year ? - 44 ... 2044 . There are no men ? 44 ... Why are there no windows here ? Or door-handles ? We slept for 53 years ? It 's those hallucinations the professor talked about . It was really nice talking to you but , if you 'll excuse us , we must go now . Were late , anyway . Goodbye . Excuse yourself , Albert . Goodbye . Should I stick around , sister ? No , thanks . I prefer to work alone . Goodbye , then . There 's a power failure on three , but III fix that tomorrow . Good night . Electrocuting ? Heroes ? What 's happening here ? You have to work your muscles . What 's happening here ? What 's it all about ? It was supposed to be so nice ! Interviews ... Why is this happening ? - God , that hurt . Shock therapy can be very beneficial to the organism . This has to be part of the experiment . Testing resistance to psychological shocks . What are you suggesting ? What am I , a guinea pig ? A world without men ! I wonder how they breed ... Don 't you worry . It was always women who gave life . Yes , but we always helped you with it ! And with pleasure , too ! Have you ever heard of parthenogenesis ? I would like to protest this surveillance of private conversations ! Thanks to parthenogenesis we are self-sufficient . Partheno what ? Parthenogenesis . Virgin birth . Virgin birth ! - If its come to ... - To what ? - If its come ... - What to ? What happened ? Good night . What 's this virgin birth ? Don 't even ask . Remember your dreams . Dreams are very important . I really hope were still sleeping . Why ? What 's the matter ? Good night . Don 't turn off the light , please . Hello ? Hello ? Can I call town from here ? I asked you something ! My wife will be very worried ! Aren 't you Genetix people overdoing it with these incessant visits ? Good night . Surely I 'm not intruding ? This is purely a personal visit . I happened to be passing by and decided to visit you . You must have a lot of interesting work if you 're here so late at night ? You can find everything out from the bulletins . - Sure . But the bulletins don 't have information on special projects . Of course not . Those are classified . Exactly . Oh , I have something for you . What 's the occasion ? Your new success . You dug something up ? - Don 't trust them . Really ? First , you were recalled from your vacation . Then , the sector you were digging in has suddenly been sealed off . One plus two equals three , and three means its a secret . I 'm just following the facts . Could you follow them somewhere else ? I wanted to shower and lie down . I understand , secrets are exhausting . Its too bad , Lamia , that you left us . You would 've had a great career at Genetix . I 'm doing well at Archeo , too . Archeo : Excavation of sentimental memories . Bye bye , dear . It would be better to turn them over to us . Whom ? Whom indeed . Mr. Max , where are you ? Good morning . Is something wrong ? No , nothing . Good morning . Quiet ! What are you looking for ? What d 'you want ? The bug . That 's a waste of time . You won 't find anything . I can 't take this ! Continual surveillance ! I can 't take this ! Artificial parthenogenesis is a form of virgin birth involving mechanical impregnation by another female cell . When was it carried out for the first time , and what was the result ? It was carried out for the first time on a sea-urchin 130 years ago . Test tube babies . Really ? They even look similar . In 1910 , parthenogenesis was induced in a frog by passing blood into an unfertilized egg . In 1939 , Gilda Pincus ... Our method of reproduction is fool-proof . You should be ashamed . Teaching children such filth ! To penetrate a virgin egg in the womb ... mechanically ... egg to egg ... Come on , not while I 'm eating . They already know . Tekla was here last night . I had a feeling . Genetix has spies everywhere . Will they want to take them from us ? No . Excavations are our business , and Tekla knows that very well . My only fear is that ... Hows your research going ? - Thank you . Very well . I now have evidence that men are the missing link in evolution . Are they not overly aggressive ? No . The tall one is quiet . The other one is a bad influence on him . Remember that atavisms could be contagious . Keep contact with them to a minimum . Thank you , sister . - Be careful . We must find another way to communicate . Take your pill . - You know any foreign languages ? No , that 's no good . They might have an interpreter . How about : If I take two spoonfuls of this pink stuff , it means get down ! Or if I take off my shirt : It means come here ! You mean some sort of code . Something like that . Mr. Max , you 're ignoring the frame of reference . What ? This way , well never communicate . Mr. Albert , are you also awake ? Its cold . - I know . They must have turned on some fan . Mr. Max . - Yes ? You can double up with me . It 'll be warmer . Thank you . Like in the army . Mr. Albert . Tell me , as a scientist , is it really possible for women to reproduce by themselves ? Absolutely possible , even in our times . But never on such a scale . Good God ! We 've slept away our entire lives ! We 've lost our family and friends ! I was supposed to receive an apartment in 1998 ! III never let myself be frozen again ! Do you have anything left ? Oh , excuse me . Here you go . Mr. Albert , what 's wrong ? Stop it . Its horrible , but well have to make the best of it . A man can adapt to anything . Here . I think we should stop being so formal . I didn 't dare suggest it . Here . Albert . Maximillian . Thank you . This is the last chance for Archeo . There 's less than one minute left . Could this be it ? Yes ! Yes , sisters ! Beautiful ! The Archeo center has managed to score . 1-0 ! 1-0 ! This could be the end ! Yes , the match is over ! Now comes the traditional shirt-exchange . Wait ... What 's happening ? Look ! Look , Albert ! Look at that ! What a fantastic program ! You 've been watching TV all day ... Look how built she is . Replay ! Replay ! Damn , no replay ... You know , if we play our cards right , this could be paradise for us . What ? Paradise . Nothing but women . All unmarried . The two of us . Barely any competition . You can 't cheat nature . Do you like brunettes or blondes ? Our world is in ruins ! And all you can think of is ass ! There 's our little blonde . Lets give it a try . Good morning . - Good morning . Lets begin the fifth day of quarantine . On a scale of 1-10 , how do you feel ? 1-10 ? When you 're here ... 7 . So far ... Let me out of here . In other words , 1 . The food ? It 's getting better , thanks . This pink stuff is really tasty . - 5 , or maybe even 6 . I 'm not eating , and you can 't make me ! Then you 'll have to be fed intravenously . Physical condition ? 10 ! Any requests ? Couldn 't we go for a walk together ? Maybe dance a little ? How dare you touch me ? The right granted me by nature ... That was very unhygienic . I 'm warning you , you could be restrained . And I 'm warning that I was boxing champion ! Clown ! Lets have some music . May I ? Don 't get any closer ! JESUS ! I 'm not aggressive . Aggressiveness , 1 . Don 't do that again . Or well have to put you to sleep . Max ? Are you still alive ? Albert ... it works ! What 's wrong , sister ? Do you want any help ? Are you feeling ill ? Everything 's fine . Get back to work . Who let her in ? She has special clearance . There was nothing we could do . You have to go easy on them . They 're unique specimens . I 'm Emma Dax . Well be working together . These two are to play a crucial role in one of the Genetix programs . I 'm responsible for the genetic security of this sector , so you 'll follow my orders . You can stuff your orders ! I report solely to Dr. Berna , and I 'm going to have to report your visit . You 'll have the opportunity to . Dr. Berna is now seeing Her Excellency , who wishes to examine the males . I 'm here to escort you there . My friend wants to go for a walk ! Put these on ! Tuck in your shirts ! Taking orders from a woman ... Gloves ! Oh , come on ! Don 't turn us into fags ! This is required if you want to leave here ! This isn 't the Kuppelweiser clinic ? Oh , excuse me . Wait a minute ! Where am I being taken ? Follow me . - Where am I being taken ? Follow me ! I 'm going , miss , I 'm going . Open Gate Three . Tell me , where 's your daddy ? What 's a daddy ? You poor dear . My little one ... You don 't even know what daddy means ? What have they done to you ? - Take the kids away ! But ... - No discussions ! Children , follow me . Lets go ! They 've been robbed of their parents ! Poor children ... - Follow me ! They don 't even know the word father ! Emma Dax to see Her Excellency . Oh God . Post-radiation mutants . Albert , what 's the world come to ? Hey Max ... Look , apples . Exactly two of them . They 're here . Hibernation is the thing of the future . If we could lower the body 's temperature by two degrees , wed live twice as long . But here are our ladies with the males . Lets go see them . I 'm very curious . They have a peculiar smell . That 's an after-effect of hibernation . How old are they ? 86 , but biological depletion is at 40.5 % What should we do ? Excuse me , you seem to be in charge here . Well then , we have a few question for you . Her Excellency should be referred to as Her Excellency . Excellency ? In that case , forgive me , please . If you 'll allow , my name is Paradys . Look out ! Let him go ! He didn 't do anything ! Don 't bite me ! - You can let him go . Don 't bite me ! My friend only wanted to introduce himself . ... I just wanted to ask what ? What happened to all the men ? Exactly ... What have you done with the men ? Not we . It was that Kuppelweiser of yours . The professor ? During the war , he invented an agent which paralyzed male genes . But the M-bomb destroyed the males genes instead of paralyzing them . In that case ... Maybe we could be of some assistance ? As breeding stock , that is , for the revival of the male gender . Within our limits , of course . It wouldn 't be the first time were sacrificing ourselves for mankind . Payment could come after completion of the entire cycle , maybe even with the payment for the extra hibernation . The money is not that important . What ? They want it to be like in the past . Like in the past ? A world with men . Logical . A typical male perspective . See that ? It 's our sacred Apple Tree , hand-planted by the First Mother . Man first plucked an apple from such a tree in Paradise , and tempted Woman with it . Because of that , we lost Paradise forever . And so today ... Where are the Holy Apples ? They have profaned the reserve ! They 've devoured our Holy Apples ! Holy ? Those worm-infested apples ? My apples ! Who 'll replace them ? Oh , what a tragedy ! We didn 't know that these apples were so precious and legendary . And they were very sour . Your people , Berna , seem to have dug up some new type of Pandors Box ! What ? Pandors box ? Take them away , and lock them up ! Hold on . If you let me go , I 'll buy you some new apples ! What ? Don 't touch me ! I 'm being beaten by a woman ! I give up ! Just leave me alone ! Are you serious ? No ! I 'm staying down here ! We have to escape . Where to ? You saw how organized they are ! They 'll catch us anywhere ! Its our duty to escape ! The doors are electrified ! We can 't dig ! There 's a lamp there ! Everything 's messed up ! Leave me alone ! You can 't think like that . There must be a different , better world somewhere . A vacuum ... I think I 've thought of something . Impossible . Take your pill . We 've sat here for eight days , and still nothing . I understand . You 're just doing your job . Hey , come here . Where do you think you 're going ? Come here . That 's a good boy . You have such a lovely mistress . And she 's always so serious ... Why is she always so serious ? Well ? Here . Good din-dins ? If you don 't eat , your mistress will lock you up just like us . Ventilation 's also down . You 're such a good vacuum . Your clearance , sister . Lamia Reno , Special Mission , Archeo . Good . And your purpose here ? I would like to see the oldest of the old . Find me the oldest . Yes , sister . It all changes daily . They 're dropping like flies . Although it won 't last much longer . Julia Novak , 74 years old . Room 114 . You have half an hour . Merry Christmas ! I feel great , and I 'm happy to be a resident at the Senior Citizens Home . I want to live out the rest of my days in warmth and peace . Broken , again ! Look at what we have to work with ! Please don 't bother me . I can 't remember anything . I 'm getting senile . - Don 't worry , they can 't hear us . I 'm not worried . I have nothing to hide . What 's that ? Please , have pity ! Don 't look ! But , this is forbidden . Don 't take it from me . I was so happy that it finally grew . What is it ? A potato . Real starch , not that synthetic stuff . I have something even better . Jam ? Strawberry ? It 's all yours if you tell me something . Can I try it ? In case its gone bad ... Very good . Nice and tart . What 's happened ? Just a fuse . Keep an eye on them . Watch them , III go get a flashlight . Oh , that 's just great . Everythings down . Turn on the emergency lighting ! Careful , don 't move ! Not in my face ! Don 't move . What were men for ? Men ? What were they for ? In most cases they were used for work . But I don 't remember . What ? They were part of your daily life . Daily , yes , and nightly , too . What about the jam ? It 's yours . I 'll tell you a secret : We 've dug up two live males ! Alive ? Yes . I 'm writing a case study on them . They were hibernated in 1991 . 1991 , A vintage year ... Do you have light there ? No ? Lets get these light back on ! They were here a minute ago . Maybe they hid in the bathroom . Do you need any help ? They 're not here . There they are ! Watch the elevator ! Good God ! Just like my Juzus ! You said Jesus , what does that mean ? I said Juzus ! That was my fiancees name . What does fiancee mean ? I don 't know if your generation has any woman left in them . Its not worth being a woman when there are no men around . But what were they used for ? Amusement ... in a manner of speaking . Amusement ? That 's just TV . There 's something about them that 's very distracting . Even fascinating . I dreamt about them last night . Oh , child , could it be that you 've fallen in love with one of them ? What do you plan to do with them ? They 're supposed to be naturalized . What ? You want to turn them into women ? That 's a fate worse than death for them ! And there 's finally an occasion for everything to return to normal . If I were younger , I would do everything in my power to save them ! You 're different from the others . What 's your name ? Lamia . Lamia ? They 're not there . Elevators empty , too . I don 't know ... Where did this come from ? Quiet ! This was used to inflict cuts ! Men once tormented women ! Males are the enemy ! Males are the enemy ! And what was this used for , sisters ? I don 't think there 's a need to explain . Section two , always true ! After this demonstration , you 'll understand why our ancestors decided to found the League ! The League advises , shields , and never yields ! Never yields ! Oh , excuse us , please continue . Who is that ? The idea was good . Yes , but we should have turned left . I 'm actually starting to like this . Well escape tomorrow , too . Even though you 've offended Her Excellency , and irresponsibly damaged our electrical system , we wish to give you one more chance . And what do we have to do ? You just have to sign this petition . To the Committee for the Purity of the Species : I hereby declare that I was born male against my will . I ask that my male conduct be extinguished and rendered void . I was perverted by male civilization . I share the universal belief that men do not exist , nor did they ever , Nor are they necessary . Could you read this back to me ? You should take this seriously and sign it . And if we don 't ? Sign it . The Assembly will decide your fate . A tribunal of broads ? No , thank you . I 'm staying right here . Its your move , sit down . Well talk seriously once were released . You know , we could have signed . Any lawyer could have gotten us out of it . What about the principle ? Your move . You 've left an opening . What the ? What 's this ? Hide ! The bathroom ! Barricade ourselves in ! What a piece of crap ! I protest ! In the name of science , I protest ! I 'm not coming out ! Ouch ! That hurts ! That really hurts ! My apologies , dear sisters , for keeping you waiting . My watch stopped . I would like to remind everyone that this proceeding , and its outcome , are strictly confidential . We have two items on our agenda , today . Both are sitting right down there . This looks really serious . Some sort of organization . The floor will now go to Dr. Berna . We are gathered here today , sisters , to decide the fate of two members of the 2nd gender , who escaped extinction and are now among us . We will present our position last , since we have the most data on this . Who takes the floor ? I don 't think there 's anything to discuss . Our grandmothers have long shown us the path needed to reach our goal . Woman must never again become a waitress Attending males at the banquet of life . Never again ! Males are the enemy ! We are all firmly committed to preventing any new outbreak of the plague known as Man , which we 've all been immunized . Aren 't you exaggerating a bit ? Without men , the world would not move . The history of progress is the history of man . You can 't deny that ! Scientists , humanists , inventors ! They were all men ! Which ones ? Name some ! Copernicus ! That 's a lie ! Copernicus was a woman ! What ? Then Einstein ! Einstein was also a woman ! I suppose Madame Curie , too ? Not the best example ... - Sorry , I got mixed up . They speak of male inventions . But what exactly have they invented ? Lets start at the beginning : The male Cain invented crime , and tested it out on his sister , Abel . Another one invented prostitution , slavery , cowardice , sloth . All the evil in the world is your fault , from religious wars , to cervical cancer ! The only things were not responsible for are hail , earthquakes , and whooping cough ! Ours is a better world . Why do they keep criticizing it ? Are you sure you 're feeling well ? You 've been thinking a lot lately . A healthy organism lives and works . A sick one introspects . As we know , we are living perfectly well without them . We live in a peaceful world without hunger , wars , venereal diseases , and other male inventions . Do you have any defense ? Well ? Take the floor . With us , you finally have the chance to bring everything back to normal . You 've use test-tubes for 50 years and you don 't know what you 've lost in the process ! In our world , you were on a pedestal , wooed , loved , showered with flowers . You were inspiration for poets , a symbol of higher ideals , of beauty . By getting rid of men , you 're losing half of yourselves ! Don 't violate the laws of nature ! This discussion is useless . They 're trying to provoke us ! You 've all gone crazy because you 've never had a man ! A man is what you need ! What does that mean , to have a man ? Having a domestic male servant , I think . It was very popular in the 20th century . If that 's all they have to say , then please take them outside . They can wait out there for the result of the vote . That was a wonderful speech . - The only way to deal with them . I feel like I 've been thrown out of the boy scouts . Take your pill . On behalf of Archeo , I propose naturalization . As head of Genetix , I must warn you of the dangers of Dr. Bernas humanitarian whims . They cannot be admitted into our community . Both should be promptly liquidated , but not before being handed over to Genetix for some important biochemical experiments . I object ! Dr. Tekla is purposefully demonizing the males to enhance her own departments prestige , and secure funds for her suspicious experiments . I protest ! Those are unfounded charges ! Genetics is the most important of sciences , whether some people like it or not ! Interesting ... Stop it , sisters ! Please consider the dignity of our Assembly . Therefore , we have two proposals . Who is for liquidation of the males ? And who is for naturalization ? Let us vote now . Lets go . What 's going on ? What ? What are you doing ? Alarm ! They 're escaping ! Alarm ! Charge ! Quick , quick ! Elevator ! Elevator ! Where to ? 1st floor . - But 1 is at the top . Oh , its working . Good . Good job . Forget it . We have to have them . At any cost ! Archeos proposal for naturalization is carried by one vote , 155-154 . Please bring them in . There seems to be some smoke . Help ! The males have escaped ! They 've broken a gas valve ! Why 'd they escape ? Everything turned out well . Didn 't I warn that they were dangerous ? North-East sector alarm ! Battle stations ! I repeat , North-East sector alarm ! We need their code . Over . JS 18447 . ON 70946 . Copy that . 100 ! No signal . 75 . Nothing . 50 ? Nothing . 25 ? Some weak signals . Up or down ? Down . Excuse me . Excuse me , perhaps I should leave ? What are you looking at me , sisters ? I 'm only four pounds overweight . Max , lets go ! Have you forgotten where we are ? Come on , Max , lets go ! What 's this ? Going swimming in your clothes , sisters ? Excuse us , we took a wrong turn . Get undressed in the elevator . Imagine that , a guy and a naked chick in an elevator ... and nothing ! Guten Tag . Passkontrolle . Ausweisse bitte . Doesn 't this tower block ever end ? I 've got some signals ! - Increase scanning range . Distinct signals . - We 've got them ! They 're on level 3 . Genetix Prime here . Genetix Prime here . They 're on level 3 . Which way is the Intercontinental Hotel ? Intercontinental ? Ein Moment bitte ... Were just passing through . - Pardon . Yes , sister , I got the impression that ... The hatchery ... - Here they breed . That 's what I just said . Anyone there ? Look , an elevator . Good , its working . Ground floor ? It seems to be getting colder . What is this ? Fresh air . Were close to an exit . - Hell ! Its some sort of mine . My earring is vibrating . I feel some impulses . Everyone out . Move . You have 15 meters of digging to do . You 'll regret your behaviour . Move ! What are you doing here ? We didn 't call Archeo today . We haven 't dug anything up . - We thought ... We were told to come here . No . It must be a misunderstanding . Really ? Well then ... that 's a fine mess you 've gotten us into , sister ! Don 't you know we have other work to do ? Blame yourselves ! You 've got quite a mess here ! What ? The real mess is in Archeo ! Really ... - You 're a bunch of ditzes ! It 's a dead end . Careful . Its just a boot . Our boys were here . Look , its our professor ! A newspaper from 1993 . Chinese protest causes UNO break-up . Americas debt ... Sale of Alaska ... Good God ! Mass production of M Bomb ... What 's this ? Hello ? Who 's that ? Get back ! Get back ! They 're in corridor 40 . Cut them off . Get in ! Hey , this must be a different country ... Finally . Its nice , here . Hey , look ! Let 's go down . - No , careful . Even here , I only see broads . Come here to spy , Archeo sisters ? Hey , they 're ... different . Completely ... different ... Come on ! Take cover ! Max ! Max ! This is some new settlement of degenerates . As soon as we get rid of one , another pops up . What is their problem ? We 've run into degenerates . We need reinforcements . Long live cookies ! Down with earrings ! You won 't catch us all ! Come on ! Come on ! That 's it ... Albert ! Were leaving ! Albert ? Albert , where are you ? Albert ? Why did you do this ? Oh , of course ... What 's she doing here ? You wanted to go outside . So that 's where well go . - I don 't believe you . We have to trust her . Ill take you to the exit . I really do wish you well . Lets go . Lamia Reno , 6364 Archeo . Where are we ? Blockhouse C. Look . What is it ? Earth . Where you want to escape . How could you let this happen ? You mean we 've been underground this whole time ? 365 meters underground . I had a hunch from the start . Is it possible to go outside ? Even for a minute ? There are over 300 units outside . Units of what ? Kuppelweiser radiation . A side-effect of the M Bomb . Its the reason why women came down these mines , and built our city-station . So it 'll never be possible to go outside ? To live there ? Never . Naturalization is your only chance . There must be some safe way to get outside ! Even for maintenance purposes ! In anti-radiation suits . With barely 1h of oxygen . Doesn 't matter . Where 're they ? You 've got only 12 days out there . Better 2 weeks out there , than a lifetime here . You 'll adjust . - Never . How do we get out ? Lets go . You didn 't think Id help you escape ? I 'm a loyal state employee . And you could have been such a great girl ! There 's no other choice . Traitor ! Were surrounded ! Lamia ! III never forgive you ! III never forgive you ! III come back and get my revenge ! Bravo , my dear . That was a great idea . You deserve a promotion . And a medal . Thank you , on behalf of my department . Oh , I forgot . Turn over all your research on the males to Emma . What for ? III be finishing your work with Dr. Tekla . Males are more dangerous than expected , so they 've to be in our custody . Don 't worry , well keep you informed of our observations . Observations ? My case-study is almost finished . Of course , well be using that , too . If I were you , I wouldn 't smirk so much , You 're starting to get wrinkles ! They 're getting ready . What should we do ? Soon , you can call me sweetheart . Why ? Why ! I would rather die than be a woman ! We thought you might want death instead of naturalization . You also said you wanted to sacrifice yourselves for science . Well help you with that . Some of our officials are getting old and tired . Your fresh , healthy , and strong organs can give them a new lease on life . Call Dr. Ossa , and tell her shell have that new kidney today . No , no , no ... What 's left after that will be boiled down into food extract . Protein is getting very hard to find these days . Cremation of our old is indeed very wasteful . The experiment we 're conducting on you will help advance our food program . That 's cannibalism ! I hope you choke on us ! Praying mantises ! Good luck , then . Good bye . And good bye to you , since we won 't be seeing each other , again . What ? I can 't believe this ! This is inhuman , and contrary To every convention . I protest ! Albert , don 't leave me alone ! Max , thanks for everything ! Albert , don 't leave me alone ... Long live men ! Stop yelling , Paradys , or III gag you . And how do you know my name , cannibal ? Tell me , who in August of 1991 , left his wife and child ? How do you know ? Because I am that child . My Jadwinia ? I have nothing in common with you . I even changed my last name . I guess you do look a bit like your mom . Don 't you dare mention her ! She was a victim of your male atrocities ! My little daughter against her daddy ? I gave you piggyback rides , spanked you on your tushy ... You owe your happiest childhood memories to me ... A childhood which I never had , since you chose hibernation over mom and I ! But now there are no more fathers , and well make sure there never will be ! Jadwinia ! Untie your dad and apologize ! Doctor , the patient is here . I 'm coming . I 'm going to save you for desert , daddy . No , no , no ! This can 't be happening ! Somebody pinch me ! This will turn me into a woman ? Anesthetic ? Great How much should I count to ? Scalpel . Lights ! Who knock the scalpel out of my hand ? Are you giving me a dirty scalpel ? Oh , who cares What 's going on ? Who 's that ? Lights ! That 's for being a bad girl . The doctor 's fainted . The male 's gone ! - The door 's jammed ! Come on ! Into the elevator ! Come on , Albert , into the elevator ! I want to be a woman Woman . Be a man ! Wake up ! What are you doing ? Do you want him to wake up ? The experiment is over . So it worked ? Better than we thought ! You wouldn 't believe the dream I had ! You can 't even imagine mine ! What was the dream ? I dreamt we woke up in a world without men . Only women ? And they bred from test-tubes . Underground ? How you know ? 'Cause I had the same dream . And they tried to castrate us . Professor , what does science say about such a coincidence ? That 's interesting , but impossible . Impossible I 'm so glad it was only a dream ! Look , he 's awake . I just had such a beautiful dream ! There , there , Albert . Pull yourself together . Stop it , will you ? What 's she doing here ? She betrayed us . - She just helped us escape . Why 're you doing this ? They took you , and my work . So they won 't get any of it ! What 'll happen when they catch us again ? They won 't catch us alive . We have to get rid of these . They 're homing devices . This will hurt a bit . We have them . - The signals are come from the lift . Here they are . What the hell ... Letting the males escape straight from the operating table ! Dr. Tekla will not be happy . Maybe its time to start thinking of asylum somewhere , sister . Someone must have helped them . Locate Lamia Reno for me . Shouldn 't you do some work ? Come see this , quick ! You again , Lamia ? What 's wrong ? Let me in . - I think I lost my transmitter . Do it quickly , so security doesn 't see . Ill only be here for a second . What are you doing ? Watch it ! You 'll blow us up ! We will , if you don 't cooperate . Strip ! Quickly ! Faster ! Lamia its going to blow ! Get undressed . Turn around . We found the signal . - Lamia Reno , blockhouse C. It seems I was right . Blockhouse C. Yes , sister . Now the environment suits ! We can 't without Her Excellency 's authorization . There 's over 300 ' radiation there ! I 'm counting . One ! Lamia , don 't ! Two ! But Lamia , open up . We know you 're in there . The laser Lamia , give us back the males . Think of who you 're helping . If we come in there , it 'll be too late . Faster . Lamia , can you hear me ? It 'll be too late . Why isn 't it coming down ? What 's stopping it ? Could it be broken ? What 's wrong ? They probably gave me the wrong key . Why doesn 't it work ? You need a password . - Password ? We don 't know . - Only Her Excellency knows it ! That 's a lie . You 're stalling ! Password , now ! You have five seconds ! Password ! Don 't blow us up ! We really don 't know ! One , two Lamia , think of who you 're helping ! Men ! Why won 't they let us go ? And allow us to die up there in peace . Its hopeless . Fuck ! It worked . They knew the password . - What did that mean ? Here it is . It worked . - Come on , Albert . Away , quickly . Well die free ! Thank you , Lamia . Run away with us . - This is my place . Anyway , I want to see their faces . You 're a great woman , Lamia . Thanks for everything . Well , two weeks . Think of who you 're helping . Once we come in , it 'll be too late ! Don 't move ! Lamia , do you hear me ? We couldn 't stop them ! That fanatic threatened to blow up the house . Who let them in in the first place ? Well talk about this later . Get me a suit . They won 't get far . Bravo , you made a good decision . The first male decision of your life ! But what 's ahead ? A desert . A desert . Anything wrong ? - I 'm not sure . Something wrong , Max ? I 've had enough of these underground bitches ! Watch out ! You still alive , Max ? - I 'm not sure . It must be some radiation filter . Its all a big hoax . Why would they go through so much trouble ? I think I 've been here before . Is this outerspace ? Watch out ! There could be some radiation ! What are you standing around for ? There are no more suits . Too bad . I 'm going after them . I 'll keep in contact . - If you find some suits , meet me up there . Understood , sister ! I 've discovered something very strange . I see them ! Look , a green forest ! It may be artificial . Lamia , follow me ! Not so fast . Does it matter where we die ? There 's enough oxygen for two more minutes . How beautiful it is , here . It was worth it . He 's gone crazy ! Take death like a man ! Were saved ! Were saved ! A stork ! A stork ! If he can live here , so can we ! Take that off ! Lamia , take that off ! Lets go . There must be a nest there . No ... No ... Take that off . Undress yourself . You 'll suffocate ! He 's right ! You 'll suffocate ! Leave me alone ! Listen , they 've gone crazy . They 've taken off their suits . I 'm going after them . How did you manage to live with such a draft ? What is this ? Is this station yours ? - I don 't know . All right , here . Higher ... You got it ? Wow ! I can 't believe it ! What is it ? You have to see it for yourself . Its some sort of blockhouse . Who 's that ? It 's like we 've traveled through time . Its some kind of mirage . Id say were home . Is this a home from your time ? Exactly . Late 20th century . Real . Its all real . Base , come in . Base , do you copy ? If you would ... Breakfast is ready . Please sit at the table . Maybe this is a museum , and all of these things exhibits ? What museum ? What exhibits ? Everything is fresh ! Miss Lamia , if you would ... Please ... Oh dear . Poor child got egg all over her . You 're just supposed to take the shell off . It slipped out of my hand ! - Too bad . Take off these gloves . Well have coffee in a second . I never knew that eating could be such a pleasure ! Speaking of which ... There are many more pleasures out there . Hands up ! You 're under arrest ! She ran out of oxygen . Personally , I like soft-boiled eggs . She got too worried by all of this . Next , you slice a piece off just like this . Don 't be shy , Albert . Mouth to mouth ! That 's garbage ... And here you have the yolk . You need a good bed for that ! I only give first aid . Sure you are . I hardly recognize you ! And once the butter melts ... I 'm only giving first aid . Did I say anything ? Where am I ? Where 's my suit ? Why are you undressing me ? I want back to the base . They 'll rescue us ! They might rescue you , but not us . Besides , there 's no radiation . What ? How could there not be ? Our instruments are foolproof . You can die if you want , I 'm going back . Stay . You 've been lied to . There 's no radiation . Didn 't you see the flowers and birds ? ... Emma Dax of Genetix , and Lamia Reno of Archeo ... They killed us off ? That 's impossible . See , you 're expendable , too ... That 's impossible ! ... It is true that two males were found and unfrozen . Thankfully , any danger they might have posed has been eliminated . Thanks to a naturalization operation this morning , they can now find a place in our community . Here they are now : What ? They 're lying through their teeth ! I 'm happy that this operation has enabled me to rise to a higher level of evolution . I , too , feel great and wish to thank the operating team for helping me ... Why do they lie ? - For higher ideals . That 's horrible ! Why should they worry everybody ? You shouldn 't do that . - They 're lying ! You don 't want me to touch you ? - Yes , no ... I don 't know . Lets go upstairs . Do you want me to touch you ? Yes . No . Yes or no ? Who lives here ? Who cares , really ... Should I touch you or not ? - Lets go ! Touch you or not ? I don 't know ! - Too much air here . I want back to the base ! Shut up or I 'll spank you in the ass ! I don 't know what 's happening to me . Beautiful , late rocococo . Its very hot today . Yes , it is . How delightfully cold this is . Due to the circumstance that we are now in , As two representatives of different sexes , I propose , as a humanist , a return to more traditional forms of contact between the two sexes . What are you doing ? I 'm a public servant . Right now , you 're a woman . What are you doing ? Step by step , were approaching natures great mystery . You 're taking very big steps . The last step will be small for man , but a giant leap for mankind . I wanted to propose to propose intimacy . Meaning ? - See , you don 't know anything ... I have three degrees ! Screw your degrees . You have your test-tubes , right ? But I 'm thinking of a more direct method ... you know ... birds and bees ... I love you . Love was a drug used by men to ... Come here ! What 's that ? What 's that ? ! Life . Why are they laughing ? This is the beginning of a new world . And if they have girls ? Knock on wood ! A boy every nine months . Or two . What if they have twins ? It 's not enough . Leave it alone . We can 't save that world . A nice set-up . Max , this has to be on a massive scale ! A sexplosion ! Well use their own weapon against them . What do you mean ? What 's that ? An elevator . Here ? I heard a lift . - Where ? There , there , mommy will bring you food in just a second . You 'll get some , too . Someone 's been drinking from my glass . Someone 's been sitting on my sofa . Very strange . Good morning . Is Jolka here ? Catch her , Max ! No ! No ! No ! III do anything you want ! Just don 't give me away ! So this is Her Excellency ? They were about to castrate us , and you prance around with a pair of fake tits ? Listen , guys , I had to be ruthless to avert suspicion ! By the way , how did you manage to survive ? That 's a long story ! Right after the war , when the League took over , I was four years old . The few boys who survived were naturalized . My mom hid me and dressed me as a girl . I eventually became a League activist . Then , ten years ago , they elected me as Her Excellency . I was finally safe , and could set myself up , here in my moms old home . There 're plenty of women lied to . They 've to be let out . - No radiation up here . It was much weaker than we expected . At first , there was panic . By the time they were set up underground , it was pointless to change anything . Its easier to rule over them when they 're underground . What about their sex drive ? The League thought of everything . A special pill turned their sex drive into a career drive . And you accepted your privileges , instead of returning this world to normal with the help of some woman ? Even if I had wanted to , it wouldn 't have worked . Its my greatest weakness . What ? I 've never had the courage to approach women . I 'm simply scared of them . What should we do with him ? He is a man , after all . We definitely shouldn 't give him over to those harpies . All right . Here 's the deal . We won 't give you away . In return , we can live here . Its a deal , guys . This is great . Make yourselves at home . You really outsmarted those women ! Let me show you something . This is my command center . Not bad at all ! We can rule from here . Take turns ... Who 's that ? These two girls we brought along , but they 're also staying . Two ? - Just two . This is Her Excellency . I am declaring tomorrow a public holiday . My own invention . Well . Lets get to work . Once a legion of you is born , nothing will stop this epidemic . Sleep tight boys . A lot is riding on you . Well see you in nine months . Mother Nature is on our side . Her laws must prevail . It 's just a matter of time .

 Mac ? Mac , can you hear me ? Where are you ? I can hear you just fine . We 're circling around Manhattan . Why ? Do you need something ? I 've got a job for you . It 's urgent . There 's a ship , the Caribbean Lady , heading towards the Verrazano Bridge . It 's not answering our calls . Can you go and check it out ? OK . We 're heading for the bridge . Going UP - Get a move on . The old man 's already called me six times . This is a helicopter , not Concorde . You try telling him that . The ship 's coming in fast . We 're above a lady holding a torch . Tell me more about this ship . The harbour master spoke to the captain last night and told him to wait for permission to enter . We 've heard nothing since and it 's heading full tilt into the harbour . Maybe their radio 's broken . Maybe . But the captain should know the rules . He should have stopped in the bay instead of steaming into the harbour . They must have drunk all the whisky they 're smuggling . I 'll go and wake them up . Good man . There it is , right there . At 12 o 'clock . You 're right , it 's coming in fast . It 's breaking all the rules . The captain must be off his head . I 'll go in for a closer look and then call you back . Mac , I want to know too . What can you see ? We can 't see anyone on board . It 's pretty weird . - Any signs of damage or fire ? - No , nothing . I think something happened all of a sudden . What the heck do you mean ? What about the lifeboats ? They 're all there . - You 'd better send a tug right away . - OK , Mac . Will do . Inform the health department and put the ship in quarantine in an isolated dock . OK . I 'll put the coastguard on alert . What now ? - The tug 's on its way . Go back . - We 're leaving now . This is a restricted area . I 'm Dr Turner from the Health Department . I was told to come . Right . The lieutenant 's waiting for you over there . - Lieutenant Arras ? - Dr Turner . Thank you for coming so quickly . Pleased to meet you . - So is this the mystery ship ? - Yes , the Caribbean Lady . It was stopped by a tug . The men went on board and shut down the engines . What about the captain and the crew ? There wasn 't a soul on deck . Just a weird smell like something rotting . - Where did it come from ? - The tropics . We 're checking on it . We need to do a hygiene check below deck . Of course . There could be survivors in the cabins . Lieutenant , I can 't proceed without a witness . You need to come with me . - With you where ? - Onto the ship . It 's the last thing I want to do , but the captain said I had to make myself available to you , so here I am . We need protective suits . I want to go home in one piece . Tell me about it ! Let 's go and shed some light on this mystery . After you , Doctor . We 'd better split up . Charlie , you and the sergeant go that way . We 'll check the bridge . It 's like a film set . Do you remember The Ghost Ship ? There must be an explanation . You told me the captain radioed in last night saying everything was fine . A whole crew can 't just disappear into thin air . Here 's the log book . Let 's see what it says . Here . The last entry from last night . It says they 're on the 15th day of their voyage and will dock in New York within 24 hours . Good visibility , moderate south-easterly wind of about seven knots , calm sea . No mention of the crew . Signed by the captain , Pedro Mendez . Fine , but where have they all gone ? One thing 's for sure , whatever happened must have happened unexpectedly because otherwise it would be logged in here . This must be the officers ' mess . - Shall we check it out ? - That 's what we 're here for . - Shall I go first ? - Sure . I thought you 'd say that . Here goes . There 's nobody here . We can go . We 'd better take a closer look . We 'll be here all night at this rate . Where the hell could these people have gone ? It looks like they left their dinner half-eaten and jumped overboard . Was the food really that bad ? Very funny , Doctor . I wonder what 's behind this door . Shall I open it ' ? That 's what we 're here for . - You don 't want to try ? - Come on , open it . Oh , my God . Judging by his uniform that must be Mendez , the captain . Right . He hasn 't been dead for very long . It looks like he was hiding from something in there . Look . It 's as if he 's been torn apart . - What could have happened ? - That 's what I want to know . Look at the state of his skin and his clothes . It 's almost as if ... I don 't know ... It 's almost as if he exploded . - Exploded ? - Not because of a bomb . It 's like he exploded from inside . Look at his stomach , his chest cavity ... It 's as if some force inside him was unleashed . Let 's inspect the other areas . Nothing here . This one 's empty . Let 's look in here . Doctor . Come here . I 've found another one . My God . He 's literally in pieces . One thing 's for sure . No disease or virus can reduce a person to this state in such a short time . The log book says everything was normal up until last night . Henry , call headquarters and tell them we 've got a major emergency . Be quick . Yes , sir . Right away . Did you see that ? He 's just like the other two . Arras was right , this definitely can 't have been a virus . What could it have been , then ? There must be ... We 've found loads more bodies down here . It 's a horrible sight . It 's like they exploded . He 's right , Lieutenant . And there 's this green slime coming from the hold . - Green slime ? - We wanted to tell you before we went in . - Is the door open ? - Yes . Let 's go and have a look . There 's loads of coffee here . " Univerx " . Strange name for Colombian coffee . - What do you think , Lieutenant ? - Don 't ask me . My doctor won 't even let me sniff it . This " X " looks strange . It 's written in different lettering . - It must be their trademark . - Right . Everything seems normal here . Yeah , apart from all the dead bodies . I don 't think it was the coffee that killed those men . Hold on a minute . What 's over there on the floor ? That 's not coffee . - What are they , Doctor ? - I don 't know . Whatever they are , they came out of these cases . Do you think the other cases are full of that stuff ? Probably . Something very strange is going on . - What do you think they are , Doctor ? - I 've no idea . I 've never seen anything like them . They look like giant pumpkins or some strange kind of fruit . I think they look like big eggs . Doctor , look behind you . - Where ? - Under the pipes . It looks like the other eggs but it 's bigger . It looks like it 's throbbing with a kind of heartbeat . They 're hot . There must be steam or hot water running through these pipes . The heat must have an effect on them . Maybe it makes them develop more quickly . That would explain why the others are still green and smaller . Of course , like being in an incubator . Do you think they 've got anything to do with those men dying ? I don 't know . We 'd have to examine them in the lab to be sure . - All right , I 'll get it . - Be careful , it could be dangerous . Don 't worry . And as soon as I was informed I gave orders to isolate the pier and place it under constant supervision . Good . Put emergency plan number seven into effect . Has General Hazon been informed ? Yes . A group of experts should be here in a couple of hours . What about the man who survived ? They 've just finished decontaminating him . He 's Lieutenant Arras from the Police Department . - He 's the one who informed us . - Let 's go and see him . Sure . Has the decontamination process been completed ? Five more minutes . He 's undergone all the necessary tests . The results don 't show any abnormal or active microorganisms on his body . Right . As long as we 're dealing with microorganisms we already know about . I 'm sick of being in here . When I get out , I 'm going to make you pay for ... - Arras , try to control yourself . - What ? Can you hear me ? You can hear me ! You 've got some nerve telling me to control myself . They 've smoked me like a herring , turned me back to front and inside out like a sock for six hours and left me here for two hours to freeze my balls off . And now you stroll in here telling me to control myself . Listen , sweetheart . Please don 't call me sweetheart , young man . You 're the one who shouldn 't be calling me young man , sweetheart . It may not be apparent but I 'm a police lieutenant , sweetheart . And I 'm a colonel . Security Service , directly responsible to the Pentagon . Special Division Five . - Any other comments , Lieutenant ? - No , sir . I mean no , ma 'am . - At ease , Lieutenant . - Yes , of course , thank you . Excuse me . - You don 't need to salute me . - Of course . As of now I am officially in charge of the Caribbean Lady case . Now , what exactly did you see on board ? You talked about eggs . Is that correct ? Well ... to tell you the truth , they did look like eggs . But they were the size of a melon or a football . There were lots of cases in there with " Univerx " written on one side . There were hundreds of them . - Was the ship 's hold full of them ? - Yes , sir . I mean yes , ma 'am . I 'm afraid it was . One of the cases had fallen over and an egg had rolled under a big heating pipe . And the egg ... - The egg was ripening . - What do you mean ? It was different . It wasn 't green like the others . It looked like it was breathing , like it was alive . That was the one that sprayed the slime on the poor doctor and made him ... I need to see one of those eggs immediately . But we have to be extremely careful . Call in the special section , squad number two . - You want to freeze the eggs ? - Yes . The eggs and all the ship 's cargo . I don 't know yet what kind of organism we 're dealing with , but whatever substance there is inside those eggs will be neutralised by freezing . Then we 'll see . All right , I 'll take care of that right away . Speaking of freezing , could I have my clothes ? For security reasons , your personal effects have been destroyed . - You 'll be issued with a set of overalls . - What ? Destroyed ? What about my credit cards ? My watch ? My wallet ? My badge ? Find the lieutenant a new pair of underpants . There . That 's the thing that killed those poor men . Macmillan . - Here , Doctor . - You pick it up , Young . The first tests all show the same results . This isn 't a plant , it 's an intensive culture of unknown bacteria . Maybe pathogenic and definitely lethal . - Artificial ? - I don 't know yet . But what we could define as the yolk of this egg is a culture that 's designed to ripen . It reacts to heat . When the temperature rises its cells mutate and it becomes lethal . - How ? - Come and have a look . Watch this . As you can see , I 'm extracting a sample of the substance from inside the egg . What 's that stuff ? It caused those men 's deaths , didn 't it ? Exactly . It 's 100 per cent active . Now watch . I 'm now going to inject some of this liquid into the animal . There . We just have to wait . The effect 's almost instantaneous . My God . I saw it happen to humans . It 's terrifying . Do you have any idea how or why this happens ? We need more time for the tests . If you need help , don 't worry . The State Department can open any door . We could call Hilton at the University of Michigan . He 's the top expert on artificial bacterial cultures and mutagens . We can have him here in three hours . - Can you see to that , Young ? - Right away . I feel responsible for all this . If I 'd alerted you straightaway when that ship was towed in , there would have been three less deaths and you would have had more time to investigate . I don 't think you were responsible for notifying me , Lieutenant . - Can I go ? - No . You 're staying here . What else can I do ? Don 't underestimate yourself . You can 't leave here because I need you . Well , if I really am necessary ... To be honest , I don 't really need you working with me . But seeing as you 've been involved in this business right from the start , I 'd rather keep the number of people who know about it to a minimum . Have I made myself clear ? Yes . Maybe too clear . Where do we start ? First we need to find out who was supposed to receive this lethal cargo . I 've already checked . It 's an import-export company . They don 't have an office , just a warehouse in the Bronx . Oh , my God , that 's their plan . That 's where the central sewer is . - Sewer ? - Yes , sewer . Sewers are damp , warm and snug , just like a massive incubator . Imagine a hundred of those eggs scattered around New York 's sewers . They 'd blow up the entire city in a few hours . Hold on a minute . The ship was going to be unloaded tomorrow morning . Right . Whoever was supposed to receive this cargo may not know about it yet . We might catch them by surprise . De Silva , you go first . Open up ! Open up ! There 's somebody in there , I 'm sure . It 's probably the watchman . What do you want at this time of night ? Police check . We 've got a search warrant . Open up . OK , OK , OK . - Young ! - Open fire ! Drop your guns . Go on . You 're surrounded . There 's no way out . No . You stay here . Bring in the flamethrowers . The flamethrowers ? Why ? It 's the safest way to destroy those eggs . Go on , burn everything . First you freeze all the ship 's cargo , now you 're burning these . You don 't believe in half-measures . I 'm just doing my duty . You must have realised by now that national security is at stake . And probably even more too . Dr Hilton and I have managed to analyse the composition of the eggs . There . Segmented dodecahedric cells . They never showed us those at police college . They don 't actually exist in nature . Not in our nature . Or in the mutations we 've been able to create up till now . As you can see , the cells of these eggs have a silicon-based structure whereas all terrestrial organisms ' cells are carbon-based . Terrestrial organisms ? We think these don 't belong to our planet . You mean that they could come from space ? Why not ? How many worlds are there in the universe ? Millions . Maybe billions . Sure , they 're millions of light years away from Earth . But perhaps a life form like this doesn 't have the same concept of time as us . It remains inert and shapeless , passive as long as it stays in the freezing temperatures of sidereal space . But if it falls into an atmosphere like ours , the heat can activate its seeds and make the eggs grow . If you 're talking about spores drifting around in space , they have one chance in several billion of falling here on Earth . And so it 's practically impossible . Completely . Unless they come ... from a much closer planet . Of course ! Try to imagine that it all happened not because the seeds that generate the eggs came to us , but because we went to them . A man could easily have brought the seeds here . But a man would never do anything like that . The warehouse guards might have been crazy hotheads but they were still men . Yes , but people can 't just go into space and come back without anybody knowing . We knew about it . We 've always known about it right from the start . Don 't you remember the mission to Mars ? Hubbard , one of the project 's two astronauts , the first one to set foot on the red planet , was slightly crazy when he came back to Earth . He said strange things had happened to him at the Martian Pole . Yes , but the other astronaut , Hamilton , said that Hubbard had dreamt it . Don 't you remember what else Hubbard said when he came back ? He spoke of ... That 's right . Now I remember . He said he 'd seen eggs . Yes . Eggs . Long , oval eggs . Eggs like footballs . Like that one over there behind us . I think Hubbard wasn 't as crazy as we all thought he was . Me included . Right . We need to find Hubbard as quickly as possible . Are you sure this is the house ? It 's the most recent address in our files . I 'd rather go by myself . You wait here . - All right . If you need me , whistle . - OK . Why does she want to go by herself ? Well , Stella Holmes was on the committee that questioned Hubbard after his mission to Mars . She was one of those who said he was crazy when he returned from space . Maybe she feels a bit guilty . I didn 't think she was capable of human reactions . Yes , we know each other , Commander Hubbard . I 'm Stella Holmes . Colonel Holmes . Special Division Five . You 're the last person I want to see . What else do you want from me ? Haven 't you put me through enough ... Stop it , Hubbard . Don 't overdo it . I fully understand your bitterness , seeing as I was on the committee that questioned you . Questioned ? You judged me and convicted me , Colonel . I was kicked out like some ... some crazy visionary . Why have you come here anyway ? Has your curiosity returned ? Come on , Colonel , what do you want to know now ? How many times a week I screw ? If you 're always like this , you wouldn 't even be able to get it up using a crane . - What do you want ? - Information . And I want it right now . Time is of the essence . This is a very serious matter . Here . Do you recognise this drawing ? What about this one ? Why do you keep tormenting me ? Can 't you see that this whole business has been over and done with for years ? These are your drawings . This is what you claim to have seen on Mars , right ? Why won 't you leave me alone ? I never saw anything . You were right . I made a mistake during that mission . Nothing strange happened . I know what you went through . Shame , dishonour . Everybody was against you and treated you like a hallucinating madman . And you were with them . You were right in the front row . Yes , I remember you , Colonel Holmes . I remember you only too well . With your top-of-the-class attitude , your sarcasm , your smugness . Always so sure of yourself . Always so damn ... Conceited and arrogant . You 're right . Now I know . You were always right , all along . Does this look like what you saw ? But ... this is a photograph . There haven 't been any more missions to Mars . No . These were found here on Earth . Thousands of them . - Here ? - Yes , here , in the United States . We found them by chance and burnt them . But how many of them are left , where , and what exactly they are , we don 't know . Hubbard , you 're the only one who can help us . You said you saw them on Mars . You do remember , don 't you ? Look , it was all ... all such a long time ago . Please tell me what happened on Mars two years ago . You know everything about our mission . We reached Mars and landed on the polar ice cap . Hamilton and I got out and had a look around . After a while we came to an opening , a kind of cave in a mountain of ice . And ... And then we ... Go on . What happened after that ? It 's all so confused , it 's ... It 's difficult to remember . Well ... we went into the cave . It was dark and strangely humid . It was there that we saw the eggs . Oh , my God , there were so many of them . They were green ... like the one in your photograph . Then we heard a noise coming from the back of the cave , as if something was approaching . Something terrible , radiating a light . - A light ? - Yes . It was moving slowly towards us and the cave was filling up with a blinding , hypnotic light . I looked at Hamilton and his eyes ... Hamilton was beginning to ... was beginning to ... Hamilton ! Mars has always stimulated man 's imagination . It is a common belief that there are other life forms in our solar system , particularly on Mars . HG Wells imagined Martians as tentacled monsters invading Earth . Others portrayed them as little green men . But as far as that cave was concerned , there was absolutely nothing inside it . No life forms , just rocks and ice like the rest of Mars . And so ... I 'm sorry to have to contradict my colleague Hubbard . Our mission pushed us beyond human limits . We came close to a nervous breakdown more than once . I was just luckier than my poor friend , that 's all . Son of a bitch . He even managed to convince me . Now we know that Hamilton lied . But I don 't understand . If he 'd seen those eggs , why did he deny it ? Let 's question Hamilton again . If we could , we would . But it 's not possible . I don 't have a gift for bringing corpses back to life , Major . Unfortunately Hamilton died six months ago . - What ? - Yes . His private jet went down off the coast of Florida . So , Colonel , who could be responsible ? Hubbard ? You saw the state he 's in . But he was the first person to talk to us about the eggs . And so I think we need to take the investigation in a different direction . What do you intend to do ? Well , I do actually have a plan . If I could call the Pentagon and persuade them to authorise me ... Call the airport and book three seats on the first flight . Tourist class , like regular passengers . Invent three names and get three fake passports . OK . Did Washington give the green light ? Yes , but with certain conditions , as usual . I 've only got 72 hours to solve the case . If I don 't , they 'll raise the alarm and call a special session of the Security Council . That means the people controlling the eggs will be able to find a safer hiding place . Exactly . We 've got to stop them before then . Luckily we already have a lead . Do you mean that coffee company in South America ? Very good . I 'm glad to know that you 're not such an idiot after all , especially ... What 's that ? Since I 've decided to bring you with me . It 's very flattering to know that your superiors appreciate you . I mean it . We 're leaving right away . Go and pack . There 's no need . I travel light . Well , go and get a spare comb , then . Do you understand ? Yes , I understand . You two would rather be alone . See you later . Have fun . So what are you going to do ? Are you coming with us ? No . I got out a long time ago . Didn 't you countersign my discharge ? I can reinstate you in your previous grade in 48 hours if that 's what you want . I don 't give a damn about your grades . What good have they done me ? With all my diplomas and merits , I 'm still a wreck . OK . You can sit there and wallow in self-pity if that 's what you want . But I was convinced that ... under that wreck there was still a man . A man who had the guts to go to Mars . A man who fought to the end for what he believed was right . A man who could help us save this damn planet from a fate worse than death . But that man remained up there on the glaciers of Mars and there 's nothing left of him ... - If you were a man , I 'd ... - What would you do ? Nothing . You wouldn 't do anything . You 're no longer capable of doing anything . You 're a wimp . You 're only half a man . That 's just so you realise it 's best not to mess with me . Right . That 's just how I like you , Hubbard . Now , do you fancy a little trip to South America ? They 've arrived . They 're at the Hotel Prado . Three separate rooms . On the second floor . I don 't know who the guy in the middle is , but he looks like a cop . She 's Stella Holmes . A first-class brain . Too bad . And then ... look who it is . My old friend Hubbard from the Mars mission . He 's the only one we still haven 't been able to get . But his turn will come . What do you intend to do ? Don 't worry , darling . They haven 't found out anything yet . We 're running this game . Since they 're on our territory , let 's start by sending them a welcome gift . Stella Holmes will be first . The coffee factory 's here . If this is their headquarters , the egg plantation should be somewhere in this area . If the eggs are there , I 'll find them . Very good . You can fly over this area tomorrow morning . Arras and I will search the coffee factory . Let 's not take anything for granted . Remember that you 're dealing with something from another planet . We 've already lost a whole day travelling . We 'll make up for it tomorrow . We 're in big trouble if we don 't , along with the rest of humanity . Well , if we don 't have a bite to eat this piece of humanity could be in big trouble very soon . - Shall we go and eat ? - Not yet . In half an hour . - Why not now ? - Because I want to wash and change . Jesus , the world 's about to be wiped out and you 're worried about getting changed . Listen , Arras , if I 'm going to be wiped out with the rest of the world , I 'd rather be wearing a nice dress and clean underwear . What the colonel 's trying to tell you , Arras , is that some people travel with more than just a comb and a pair of pyjamas . I sleep naked . I don 't wear pyjamas . Out . I want to have a shower . She said out . Didn 't you hear ? I said out . - I was talking to both of you . - OK . What a shame . Such a beautiful woman . Is something wrong with her or is she happily married ? Of course . To a whip and a test tube . You know , I think the colonel would have been in her element in one of those ice caves on Mars . Deep down all women are the same . It 's just a question of knowing how to handle them . - I know how to do it , if I say so myself . - Really ? Don 't worry , I 'm not going to try it on with Stella . I 'm a warm-blooded creature . I don 't like the cold . - I 'll see you at lunch . - In half an hour ? Very good . See you later . Didn 't you say you didn 't like the cold ? Yes , you 're right . I 'd better turn off the air conditioning . It 's not the only thing you should turn off . All right , all right . - I 'll come and get you in half an hour . - All right . Who 's there ? Oh , my God ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Hello ? Could you give me the number of the airport , please ? Help ! Can I speak to the operator , please ? Can you put me through to Miss Stella Holmes ' room ? Number 227 . Thank you . Help ! Help ! Get me out of here ! Help ! Hubbard ! I 'm sorry , sir , there 's no answer from room 227 . That 's fine , no problem . Thank you . - Ready ? - Yes , I was just waiting for you . Are we going to eat here in the hotel or go somewhere else ? I think we 'll do what the colonel decides , as usual . I think we should call her . No , let 's go and eat on our own . - Yeah , but she ... - No , no , no . Let 's leave her alone . If she 's hungry she can order room service . What , an ice lolly ? It 's strange , though . It 's not like her to be late . You 're right . When I put a " Do not disturb " sign on my door it 's because I 'm doing serious stuff , not just having a shower . What 's the matter ? I don 't know . Maybe we 'd better knock . No , come on . What if she 's sleeping ? Don 't worry . I 'll take the blame . Help ! Help ! Hubbard , get me out of here ! Help ! Hubbard ! Hubbard ! Help ! Get me out of here ! Just a little . Bon appétit . Thank you . - This is a local speciality . - Really ? I got them to make it for you to celebrate the untimely and tragic demise of Stella Holmes . What 's wrong ? The egg . The egg . But ... What 's happened to the egg ? I felt it inside me , like I always do . Another one of our creatures has been sacrificed in vain . It was all to no avail . That woman is still alive . - But ... that 's impossible . - I know she is . I can feel ... I can feel that she 's alive . The egg didn 't manage to kill her . Out ! Everybody out ! Leave me alone . You too . Out ! This place looks really bleak . I 've got this nasty feeling inside my head . - It could mean we 're on the right track . - Yeah ... It could also mean that we 're heading straight into a trap . Would you feel safer if we had the Marine Corps as back-up ? I don 't aspire to be a national hero , I 'm happy with a modest police pension . Hello . We phoned this morning . Are you Mr Gomez ? No , sir . That 's Mr Gomez . Gomez , these are the Americans who called about the coffee order . This is Mr Gomez . Hello , my name 's Arras . Pleased to meet you . - Hello , Mr Gomez . - Shall we go in ? Of course . This way . As you can see , we use the most modern equipment . We have 200 employees in various departments , which each have a different function . Here the coffee is roasted at different temperatures depending on where it is exported . We roast three tons every day . If you teamed up with a Swiss cattle farm you 'd make great cappuccino . Madam ? This American lady and gentleman would like information about our coffee . Yes , I was waiting for them . You can go . I 'm Perla de la Cruz , the owner . How can I help you ? Well , we 'd like to buy a large batch of your coffee . You see , we know that you have this very unique type . Yes , a very special kind . I know you recently sent a large shipment to New York on the Caribbean Lady . That 's right . - Really ? - Yes . Doesn 't that name mean anything to you ? Frankly , no . We send shipments all over the world . But if you 'd like to get an idea of the various kinds of coffee we produce , follow me . - Then , you can choose the one you like . - Excellent idea . We have a complete production chain here , including instant and decaffeinated coffee . The various operations are controlled by electronic machines . Each unit is vacuum-packed and contains 200 grams of coffee . This way , please . This is where the coffee is unloaded and stored before processing . Our plantations are nearby . Interesting , isn 't it ? There we are . We 've reached the end . The end ? What does that mean ? All your questions will be answered here . This is proof that you 're the one cultivating those eggs , right ? Yes . But I 'm not alone . I 'm the head of this operation . Hamilton ! You 're still alive ? Yes , but luckily you won 't be able to tell anyone . A map ... and a flare pistol . It 's not much but it 's better than nothing . - Arras ? - Yes , Colonel Holmes . You can call me Stella . Thanks . - My name 's Tony . - OK . Well , Tony , if only we 'd listened to your sound Brooklyn cop instinct instead of my MIT-graduate calculations . You 're right . I told you I felt something scratching my head from the inside . A premonition . I 'm very receptive . Maybe it 's because I 've got a low IQ . You want to know something ? Now I can tell you . You 've always made me feel like a caveman . You 're the first woman in my whole life that I didn 't have the guts to try it on with . What a pity . Maybe this was the one time that it was really worth trying . Turn around towards me . It 's not much , I know . It 's the most fantastic thing that 's happened to me in my whole life . Who did this ? It was ... zombies . White zombies . White zombies . Come on ! Move ! This way . Hurry up ! Get a move on . First squad , sector A. Second squad , sector B. Only pick the ripe ones . White zombies . Watch out . Handle those eggs carefully . Slowly . Slowly ! I said slowly ! Come on , let 's go . Let 's go . On your feet . It 's time to go . Where ? To the Cyclops . - The Cyclops ? - Yes . The Cyclops . Hey , you . Where the hell do you think you 're going ? That 's not your place . Get in the front . Come on , we 've got to go . Hundreds of eggs are being collected right now . Everything will be ready in a few days . The cases will be shipped all around the world . This time there won 't be any mistakes . No one will stop us . What 's the purpose of all this , Hamilton ? It 's absolute madness . What 's the purpose of a living being ? To grow , multiply , survive . Eat so as not be eaten . Kill so as not be killed . The strongest creature will crush the weakest . - You 're not talking like a human being . - He 's not a human being . He was once but sadly he isn 't any more . You can 't understand me . A superior being is speaking to you through me . He can destroy you with the mere power of his mind . No , he 's not that superior . You were destroyed , Hamilton . Hubbard wasn 't . His mind resisted on Mars and now it can resist again here . It will destroy your damned master , the monster that 's dominating you . Yes , that 's true . Hubbard resisted . But he no longer exists , Colonel Holmes . We arranged for his little plane to be sabotaged . Hubbard is dead . Dead ? - Everything all right ? - Yes . We 've collected 240 eggs . Excellent . Give me the checklist . This is the Cyclops who creates the eggs . He grew out of the tiny seed that I brought back from Mars . He produces the eggs and the heat causes them to ripen . Go on . He 's calling you . He wants you . Go ! Tony . Tony ... Tony , no ! - Shut up ! - Let me go . - It 's no use . - Tony ! Tony , stop ! Tony ! Stop ! He 's in his power . One false move and I 'll shoot you . Hubbard ! So you know who I am . Then you 'll also know that I 've got nothing to lose . Where do you incubate the eggs ' ? It 's too late . Hamilton has captured your friends . Hamilton ? Yes , your old friend Hamilton . Where are they ? Where are they ? In the forbidden room . Take me there . Move ! Tony ! No ! No ! Look . Look ! Look . Now go . It 's your turn . If you say one word , you 're dead . Kill him ! He 's a spy . Stop ! No ! Hamilton ! Watch out ! If you shoot you 'll hit her . No ! Hamilton , don 't shoot . Don 't do what the Cyclops commands . Don 't shoot ! No ! Stella ! Damn you ! This way ! Surround the factory . Block off the area . We 're safe . It 's doomed now . Let 's go . Stop ! - Come on . - Keep moving . Go on , keep going . Poor Hamilton . It wasn 't his fault . The man you saw was just an appendage of that monster . Completely under his power from the moment they met in that cave on Mars . Right , and they both died at the same time . But the real Hamilton never came back to Earth . He stayed up there . On Mars , on the Cyclops star . From now on it 'll be hard for us to look at the sky without thinking that maybe somewhere in space there 's still something waiting .

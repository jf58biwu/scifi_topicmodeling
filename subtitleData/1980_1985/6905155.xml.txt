 ( engine whirring ) ( electrical fizzling ) What the hell ... ? Goddamn son-of-a-bitch ... ( electrical fizzling ) What the hell ... ? Hey , my turn . Hey , what 's wrong with this picture ? ( laughing ) Nice night for a walk , eh ? Nice night for a walk . Wash day tomorrow . Nothing clean , right ? Nothing clean . Right . I think this guy 's a couple of cans short of a six-pack . Your clothes , give them to me . Now . Fuck you , asshole . ( grunting ) ( groaning ) ( siren wailing ) ( helicopter passing overhead ) ( man groaning indistinctly ) ( electrical fizzling ) ( moaning ) ( helicopter passing overhead ) Hey , buddy , did you just see a real bright light ? ( indistinct police radio chatter ) ( man ) See that guy ? Hold it right there . - He 's rabbiting . - Hey ! I said hold it ! - Go ! - ( siren wailing ) That son-of-a-bitch took my pants . ( police siren wailing ) ( tires screech ) - What day is it ? The date . - 12th May . - Thursday . - What year ? ( siren wailing ) He 's got my gun . Let 's go . ( panting ) ( sirens wailing in distance ) ( indistinct police radio chatter ) ( police sirens wailing ) ( siren wailing ) Guard it for me , Big Buns . Hi . I 'm late . So am I. - I 'm in it . - So am I. - Honey , can I have that coffee now ? - Yes , sir . - OK . Who gets the burly-beef ? - I ordered barbecued . I think that 's mine , but I didn 't order fries . - ( woman ) Mine 's the chili beef deluxe . - OK , who gets the burly-beef ? - Miss , we 're ready to order now . - Yes , ma 'am . - Ah ! - Oh ! I 'm so sorry . This isn 't real leather , is it ? ( man ) Nice going , kid . I ought to give you the tip . Look at it this way . In 100 years , who 's gonna care ? ( man ) The 12-gauge auto-loader . That 's Italian . You can go pump or auto . The.45 long slide with laser sighting . These are new . We just got them in . That 's a good gun . Just touch the trigger , the beam comes on , and you put the red dot where you want the bullet to go . You can 't miss . - Anything else ? - Plasma rifle in the 40-watt range . Hey , just what you see , pal . The Uzi nine millimeter . You know your weapons , buddy . Any one of these is ideal for home defense . So which will it be ? - All . - I may close early today . It 's a 15-day wait on the handguns , but the rifles you can take now . - You can 't do that . - Wrong . ( tires screech ) ( man ) Hi , baby . Yeah , yeah , it 's me . Listen , I need you to come pick me up . My bike just broke down . I don 't care what you 're doing . Come and get me . What the ... ? ( woman speaks indistinctly on phone ) ( man ) Hey , man , you got a serious attitude problem . ( woman continues speaking on phone ) ( dog barking ) - Sarah Connor ? - Yes ? I 'm on my break , Chuck . Carla 's got my station . Sarah , come here . It 's about you . I mean , sort of . So incredible . You 're not gonna believe this . Sit , you 're going to love this . Sh ! Once again , Sarah Connor , 35 , mother of two , brutally shot to death in her home this afternoon . You 're dead , honey . ( fizzling ) ( engine starts ) ( rumbling ) ( groaning ) - ( gasping ) - ( man on radio ) ... if you 're into sound , for the greatest sound around , come to Bob 's Stereo at 2500 Sepulveda . We 've got woofers , tweeters , the newest in audio and compact discs . We 've got graphic equalizers and sound balancers that ... ( rock music plays on headphones ) Sorry . ( phone rings ) Hello ? ( man on phone ) First I 'm gonna rip the buttons off your blouse one by one , then run my tongue down your neck to your bare , gleaming breasts . And then slowly ... slowly pull your jeans off inch by inch . ( laughs ) Ginger , it 's Matt . And lick your belly in circles further and further down , and then pull your panties off with my teeth . Who is this ? God . Sarah ? ( giggles ) Jesus . I 'm sorry . I thought you were ... Can I talk to Ginger , please ? Sure . Oh ! ( humming ) It 's the creep . Hello ? First I 'll rip the buttons off your blouse one by one ... ( yelling ) You fucking pigs ! Wait till I get my hands on you . Get off me ! Ed . - What have you got ? - Dead girl . - I can see that . - Sarah Ann Connor , secretary , 35 . Shot six times at less than ten feet . Large caliber weapon . You know , these work . - What 's this ? - Dead girl two . Sent over from the Valley division this afternoon . Are you sure there 's a point to all of this ? Look at the name , Ed . Sarah Louise Connor . Is this right ? You 're kidding me . The press is gonna be short-stroking it . - A one-day pattern killer . Hm . - I hate the weird ones . - So ... - ( both laugh ) Better than mortal man deserves . - Ginger , have you seen Pugsley ? - Not lately . Did you check messages ? I thought you did . ( answering machine rewinding ) - Hi , Sarah , this is your mom ... - There you are , young man . You mind your mother . ( man ) Hi , Sarah . Stan Morsky . Something 's come up . Looks like I won 't be able to make it tonight . Just can 't get out of it . I 'm really sorry . I 'll make it up to you . Call you in a day or so . Bye . That bum . So what if he has a Porsche ? He can 't treat you like this . It 's Friday night , for Christ 's sake . I 'll live . I 'll break his kneecaps . Well , Pugsley still loves me . Don 't you , baby ? God . It 's disgusting . I 'm gonna go to a movie , kiddo . Have a good time . - We will . You , too . - OK . ( gasps ) Damn it , Matt . ( engine revving ) ( car engine starts ) - Oh , shit . - ( man ) Lieutenant ! These killings occurred in the order of their listings in the phone book . - What can I tell you ? No comment . - But , Lieutenant ... ( reporters clamoring ) - That coffee 's two hours cold . - Mm-hm . I put a cigarette out in it . - Did you reach the next girl yet ? - No . I got her answering machine . - Send a unit . - I sent a unit . There 's no answer . - The apartment manager 's not in . - Call her . - I just called her . - Call her again . Give me a cigarette . ( phone ringing ) ( Ginger on machine ) Hi , there . ( laughs ) Fooled you . You 're talking to a machine . But don 't be shy . It 's OK . Machines need love , too , so talk to it ... - ( turns up volume of music ) - ( pop music plays ) Same shit . I can hear it now . He 's gonna be called the goddamn Phone Book Killer . I hate these press cases . Especially the weird press cases . - Where are you going ? - To make a statement . Maybe make these jackals work for us for a change . If I can get on the tube by 11 : 00 , maybe she 'll call us . Well , how do I look ? - Like shit , boss . - Your mama . This just in . Police have announced the name of the victim in the second of two execution style murders which took place today . Incredibly , the names of the two victims are virtually identical . Two hours ago , 35-year-old Sarah Ann Connor was pronounced dead ... - Can we change this ? - Sarah Louise Connor ... Don 't touch it ! Police are refusing to speculate on the similarity between the shooting deaths and no other connection between the two victims has been established yet . We 'll have more on this late-breaking story as it comes in . ( reporter continues talking ) ( muffled rock music plays ) ( loud music plays ) - Hey , you got a phone ? - It 's in the back . Hey , $ 4.50 . ( rock music continues ) ( woman ) You have reached the Los Angeles Police Department emergency number . All lines are busy . If you need a police car sent out to you , stay on the line . ( indistinct police radio chatter ) ( pop music plays over headphones ) ( screams , gasps ) Pugsley ! Shoo ! Go on . I 'm gonna make a belt out of you . Whoa ! Don 't make me bust you up , man . ( music playing over headphones ) ( singing ) ( grunting ) ( screams ) ( shrieks ) ( gasping ) ( phone rings ) ( Ginger on machine ) Hi , there . Fooled you . You 're talking to a machine . But don 't be shy . It 's OK . Machines need love , too . So talk to it and Ginger , that 's me , or Sarah will get back to you . - Wait for the beep . - ( beeping ) ( Sarah ) Ginger , this is Sarah . Pick up if you 're there . I 'm at this place on Pico Boulevard called Tech Noir . I 'm really scared . I think that there 's somebody after me . I hope that you play this back soon . I need you and Matt to come and pick me up as soon as possible . The police keep transferring me around . I 'm gonna give ' em another try . The number here is 555-91 75 . Call me , kiddo . I need your help . ( man ) It 's her . Sarah Connor ? It 's Lieutenant Traxler . Lieutenant , don 't put me on hold and don 't transfer me to another department . Don 't worry , I won 't . Just relax . Can you tell me where you are ? - I 'm in this bar called Tech Noir . - Yeah , I know it . It 's on Pico . - Are you all right ? - Yeah , but I don 't wanna leave . - I think there 's a guy following me . - Now , listen carefully . You 're in a public place , so you 'll be safe till we get there . But stay visible . Don 't go outside or even to the restroom . - I 'll have a car there in a minute . - OK . ( loud music continues ) ( woman ) Hey , that guy didn 't pay . ( groaning ) ( rock music fades out ) ( crowd screaming ) ( gasping ) ( crowd screaming ) Come with me if you wanna live . Come on ! ( grunting ) ( mechanical whirring ) ( gasps ) ( screams ) ( tires screeching ) This is one-L-19 . I got a hit-and-run felony . Suspect vehicle : late model gray Ford headed westbound on Seventh . He 's really moving , punching lights all the way . I 'm gonna need an ambulance at Seventh and Broadway right now . Hold it ! Ah ! ( indistinct radio chatter ) Hold on . Are you injured ? Are you shot ? ( shrieking ) Do exactly what I say . Exactly . Don 't move unless I say . Don 't make a sound unless I say . Do you understand ? - Do you understand ? - Yes ! Please don 't hurt me . ( tires screeching ) ( horn honks ) I 'm here to help you . I 'm Reese . Sergeant Tech-Com . DN38416 . Assigned to protect you . You 've been targeted for termination . ( indistinct radio chatter ) ( voice of officer ) This is one-L-19 . Westbound on Olympic , approaching Overland . This is a mistake . I didn 't do anything . No , but you will . It 's very important that you live . This isn 't true . How could that man just get up after you ... It 's not a man . A machine . A Terminator . Cyberdyne Systems model 101 . ( tires screeching ) A machine ? Like a robot ? Not a robot . A cyborg . Cybernetic organism . - No . He was bleeding . - Just a second . - ( siren wailing ) - ( tires screeching ) Get your head down ! All right , listen . The Terminator 's an infiltration unit . Part man , part machine . Underneath , it 's a hyper-alloy combat chassis . Microprocessor controlled . Fully armored , very tough . But outside it 's living human tissue . Flesh , skin , hair , blood ... grown for the cyborgs . - Look , Reese , I don 't know ... - Pay attention . I gotta ditch this car . The 600-Series had rubber skin . We spotted them easy . But these are new . They look human . Sweat , bad breath , everything . Very hard to spot . I had to wait till he moved on you before I could zero him . Look , I am not stupid . They cannot make things like that yet . Not yet . Not for about 40 years . Are you saying it 's from the future ? One possible future . From your point of view , I don 't know tech stuff . Then you 're from the future , too . Is that right ? - Right . - Right . Cyborgs don 't feel pain . I do . Don 't do that again . - Just let me go . - Listen and understand . That Terminator is out there . It can 't be bargained with , it can 't be reasoned with . It doesn 't feel pity or remorse or fear , and it absolutely will not stop ... ever ... until you are dead . Can you stop it ? ( sighs ) I don 't know . With these weapons , I don 't know . ( woman over police radio ) All units . Ford suspect vehicle has been found in a parking structure ... ( indistinct radio chatter ) Reese , why me ? Why does it want me ? There was a nuclear war . A few years from now all this , this whole place , everything it 's gone . Just gone . There were survivors . Here , there . Nobody even knew who started it . - It was the machines , Sarah . - I don 't understand . Defense network computers . New , powerful hooked into everything , trusted to run it all . They say it got smart ... a new order of intelligence . Then it saw all people as a threat . Not just the ones on the other side . It decided our fate in a microsecond . Extermination . Did you see this war ? ( tires screeching ) ( grunts ) No . I grew up after . In the ruins . Starving . Hiding from the H-Ks . - H-Ks ? - Hunter-killers . Patrol machines built in automated factories . Most of us were rounded up , put in camps for orderly disposal . This was burned in by laser scanner . Some of us were kept alive . To work . Loading bodies . The disposal units ran night and day . We were that close to going out forever . But there was one man who taught us to fight . To storm the wire of the camps . To smash those metal motherfuckers into junk . He turned it around . He brought us back from the brink . His name was Connor . John Connor . Your son , Sarah . Your unborn son . ( engine turning over ) ( tires screeching ) ( gunshot ) ( gunfire ) Drive ! Reese ! Reese ! ( sirens wailing ) No , Reese . No , no , no . They 'll kill you . ( officer ) You in the Cadillac , let me see your hands now . Get out of the car . Drop to your knees . - Out of the car . - Drop to the ground . Sarah . Sarah , try to drink some of this . Listen , are you sure it 's them ? ( sobbing ) I mean , maybe I should look at the bodies . No . They 've been identified and there 's no doubt . ( sobbing ) Ginger . - Kiddo . - Sarah ... - Sarah , this is Dr. Silberman . - Hi , Sarah . I want you to tell him everything Reese told you . Do you feel up to that ? Yeah , I guess so . - You 're a doctor ? - ( yawning ) Criminal psychologist . - Is Reese crazy ? - That 's what we 're gonna find out . ( gears whirring ) ( Silberman ) So you 're a soldier . Fighting for whom ? With the 132nd under Perry . From ' 21 to ' 27 . That 's the year 2027 ? ( Reese ) That 's right . Then I was assigned ... - This is fucking great . - ... under John Connor . - Who was the enemy ? - A computer defense system built ... - ( pager beeping ) - God damn . Sorry . ... built for SAC-NORAD by Cyberdyne Systems . I see . And this computer thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy . Killing him , in effect , before he 's even conceived . A sort of retroactive abortion ? ( chuckles ) Silberman cracks me up . Last week , a guy burned his Afghan . - He screwed it first ... - Ed , shut up . Why didn 't the computer just kill Connor then ? Why this elaborate scheme with the Terminator ? It had no choice . Their defense grid was smashed . We 'd won . Taking out Connor then would make no difference . Skynet had to wipe out his entire existence . Is that when you captured the lab complex and found ... What is it called ? The time displacement equipment ? That 's right . The Terminator had already gone through . Connor sent me to intercept , and they blew the whole place . Well , how are you supposed to get back ? I can 't . Nobody goes home . Nobody else comes through . It 's just him and me . ( gears whirring ) It 's just him and me . ( Silberman ) Why didn 't you bring any weapons ? Something more advanced . Don 't you have ray guns ? - ( chuckles ) Ray guns . - Show me a piece of future technology . ( Reese ) You go naked . Something about the field generated by a living organism . - Nothing dead will go . - Why ? I didn 't build the fucking thing . ( Silberman ) OK , OK . But this cyborg , if it 's metal ... ? - Surrounded by living tissue . - Oh , right . This is great stuff . I could make a career out of this guy . See how clever it is ? It doesn 't require a shred of proof . Most paranoid delusions are intricate , but this is brilliant . ( Silberman ) Why were the other two women killed ? ( Reese ) Most records were lost in the war . Skynet knew almost nothing about Connor 's mother . Her full name , where she lived . They just knew the city . The Terminator was just being systematic . - ( Silberman ) Let 's go back ... - Look , you have heard enough . I have answered your questions . Now I have to see Sarah Connor . - I 'm afraid that 's not up to me . - Then why am I talking to you ? - Who is in authority here ? - Please ... Shut up ! You still don 't get it , do you ? He 'll find her . That 's what he does . That 's all he does . You can 't stop him . He 'll reach down her throat and pull her fucking heart out ! - Doc . - Let go of me ! Sorry . ( sighs ) So Reese is crazy ? In technical terminology , he 's a loon . Sarah , this is what they call body armor . Our TAC guys wear these . It 'll stop a 12-gauge round . This other individual must 've been wearing one under his coat . Feel that . Go ahead . - He punched through the windshield . - He was probably on PCP . Broke every bone in his hand . He wouldn 't feel it for hours . There was this guy once ... You see this scar ? - Here . - Thank you . There 's a couch in this other room . Stretch out and get some sleep . Be at least an hour before your mother gets here from Big Bear . - I can 't sleep . - Try . It may not look it , but that couch is very comfortable . You 'll be perfectly safe . We got 30 cops in this building . Thank you . - Good night . - Good night . ( buzzer sounds ) ( pager beeping ) I 'm a friend of Sarah Connor . I was told she 's here . Could I see her ? No . Can 't see her . She 's making a statement . Where is she ? It may take a while . If you wanna wait , there 's a bench over there . I 'll be back . - Ah ! - ( indistinct shouting ) Let 's go , let 's go ! ( gunfire ) Stay here . ( gunfire ) Let 's get outta here ! ( indistinct shouting ) ( gunfire ) Watch him . ( grunting ) ( gunfire continues ) ( indistinct shouting ) Ed ... Hey ! Sarah ! Reese . ( Reese ) This way . ( tires screeching ) ( man on radio ) KFLB news time 4 : 36 . Top story of the hour : the largest single law enforcement mobilization in California history is currently underway . Police in five counties are engaged in a massive manhunt for ... Take this . All right , let 's get this off the road . - You cold ? - Freezing . ( shuddering ) Reese ? - You got a first name ? - Kyle . Kyle , what 's it like when you go through time ? White light . Pain . - It 's like being born maybe . - Oh , my God . I caught one back there . - You mean you got shot ? - It 's not bad . - We gotta get you to a doctor . - It 's OK . Forget it . What do you mean , forget it ? Are you crazy ? Take this off . Jesus . See ? It passed right through the meat . ( groans ) This is gonna make me puke . - Would you just talk about something ? - What ? I don 't know . Anything . Just talk . Tell me about my son . He 's about my height . He has your eyes . What 's he like ? You trust him . He 's got a strength . I 'd die for John Connor . Well , at least now I know what to name him . Don 't suppose you know who the father is so I won 't tell him to get lost ? John never said much about him . - I know he dies before the war ... - Wait . I don 't wanna know . So was it John that sent you here ? I volunteered . - Why ? - It was a chance to meet the legend . Sarah Connor , who taught her son to fight , organize , prepare from when he was a kid . When you were in hiding before the war . ( laughs ) You 're talking about things I haven 't done yet in the past tense . - It 's driving me crazy . - ( groans ) Are you sure you have the right person ? I 'm sure . Come on . Do I look like the mother of the future ? I mean , am I tough ? Organized ? I can 't even balance my checkbook . Look , Reese , I didn 't ask for this honor and I don 't want it . Any of it . Your son gave me a message to give to you . Made me memorize it . " Thank you , Sarah , for your courage through the dark years . I can 't help you with what you must soon face , except to say the future is not set . You must be stronger than you imagine you can be . You must survive or I will never exist . " That 's all . It 's a good field dressing . You like it ? It 's my first . ( Reese ) Get some sleep . It 'll be light soon . OK . Talk to me some more . About what ? Tell me about where you 're from . All right . You stay down by day , but at night you can move around . You still have to be careful because the H-Ks use infrared . But they 're not too bright . John taught us ways to dust them . That 's when the infiltrators started to appear . The Terminators were the newest . The worst . ( man over radio ) Traversing your sector in search mode . 750 meters north of your position . Let 's go . - ( Reese ) Reese . DN384 ... - Right . Let him in . ( indistinct radio chatter ) ( imitating gunfire ) ( woman coughing ) ( woman sobbing ) ( dog barking ) ( man ) Terminator ! ( screaming ) ( woman shrieks ) Ah ! - ( dog whimpering ) - ( screaming ) ( dog barking in distance ) I was dreaming about dogs . We use ' em to spot Terminators . Your world is pretty terrifying . Hey , buddy , you got a dead cat in there or what ? ( knocking ) ( mechanical whirring ) Fuck you , asshole . ( mechanical whirring ) God damn . ( Sarah ) Thank you . ( horn blares ) Is this enough ? Yeah , it 's enough . I don 't wanna ask where you got it . - ( man ) I 'm coming . - We need a room . - ( man ) All right . - With a kitchen . Do you have one with a kitchen ? I am dying for a shower . We should check your bandage , too . Later . I 'm going out for supplies . Keep this . No , I can 't tell you where I am , Mom . I was told not to say . ( mother ) But I need to know where to reach you . You tell me to hide out at the cabin and you won 't tell me what 's going on ? I am worried sick here . OK . OK , here 's the number . - ( Sarah ) You ready ? - Yes . Go ahead . It 's 408-555-1439 . Room nine . - Got it ? - I 've got it . I gotta go . I 'm sorry I can 't tell you more right now . I love you , Mom . ( mother 's voice ) I love you , too , sweetheart . ( man ) Tiki Motel . ( normal voice ) Give me your address there . ( Sarah ) What have we got ? Mothballs ... corn syrup ... ammonia . What 's for dinner ? - Plastique . - Mm . That sounds good . What is it ? It 's a nitroglycerin base . It 's a bit more stable . I learned to make it when I was a kid . Make sure there 's none on the threads . Like this . Screw the end cap on . Very gently . You must 've had a fun childhood . That 's good . All right . Six more like that and I 'll get started on the fuses . ( Sarah ) He 'll find us , won 't he ? ( Reese ) Probably . It 'll never be over , will it ? Look at me . I 'm shaking . Some legend . You must be pretty disappointed . No , I 'm not . Kyle , the women in your time , what are they like ? Good fighters . That 's not what I meant . Was there someone special ? Someone ? A girl , you know . No . Never . Never ? I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . So much pain . Pain can be controlled . You just disconnect it . So you feel nothing ? John Connor gave me a picture of you once . I didn 't know why at the time . It was very old ... torn , faded . You were young like you are now . You seemed just a little sad . I used to always wonder what you were thinking at that moment . I memorized every line every curve . I came across time for you , Sarah . I love you . I always have . I shouldn 't have said that . Think fast . ( both chuckle ) ( dog barking ) ( gun clicks ) Trade places . ( Reese ) Faster ! Drive faster ! ( horn blares ) - ( gunfire ) - ( gasping ) ( screams ) Kyle ! Oh , my God . ( Sarah screams ) ( screams ) ( Reese groaning ) Kyle . ( truck horn blaring ) - Whoa ! - Son-of-a-bitch ! ( tires squealing ) You stay here . Let 's get outta here . Get out . Kyle . Come on . Get up . Kyle , come on . Help me ! Get out . Get out . ( tires squealing ) Don 't stop . Run ! ( Reese ) Sarah ! Kyle . Kyle . Kyle ... We did it , Kyle . We got him . ( Sarah ) No ! No ! ( panting ) Wait . What are you doing ? Cover , so he can 't track us . ( machinery whirring ) Come on ! Come on . - No , Kyle ! Come on ! - ( grunting ) - Come on ! - Leave me here . Move it , Reese ! On your feet , soldier ! On your feet ! Move it ! ( loud mechanical whirring ) ( Sarah ) Get back . Go back . - Run , Sarah . - No . Run ! Run ! ( Reese ) Come on , motherfucker . ( grunts ) ( shrieks ) ( yelping ) No . ( screams ) You 're terminated , fucker . ( mechanical whirring ) ( fizzling ) ( shuddering ) ( sirens approaching ) Kyle . ( indistinct radio chatter ) ( Sarah ) Tape seven . November 10 . Where was I ? What 's most difficult is trying to decide what to tell you and what not to . But I guess I have a while before you 're old enough to understand these tapes . They 're more for me at this point just so that I can get it straight . ( both speaking Spanish ) Fill her up . ( speaks Spanish ) ( Sarah ) Should I tell you about your father ? Boy , that 's a tough one . Will it affect your decision to send him here , knowing that he is your father ? If you don 't send Kyle , you can never be . God , a person could go crazy thinking about this . I suppose I will tell you . I owe him that . Maybe it 'll help if you know that in the few hours that we had together we loved a lifetime 's worth . ( speaking Spanish ) - What did he just say ? - He says you 're very beautiful . He is ashamed to ask you for five American dollars for this picture . But if he doesn 't , his father will beat him . Pretty good hustle , kid . ( speaking Spanish ) ( boy speaking Spanish ) ( speaking Spanish ) What did he just say ? He said there 's a storm coming in . I know . ( wind howling ) ( thunder crashes ) English - US - PSDH

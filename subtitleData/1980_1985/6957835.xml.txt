 I had a dream about a man . He 's not from our world . He came down from the sky and spoke to me . He said , " We come from Earth . " Stay here . We may have just lost York and Conover . And maybe not . We can 't stop now . We 're talking about an entire planet that might be colonized . Can I help you ? We are from Earth , and this is Mars . Young man , this is Green Bluff , Illinois . Then these people are not my friends , not my family . They 're Martians . Then what about me ? Then you 're not my brother , Edward . No , Arthur , I 'm not . Two expeditions have failed , John . Why another ? Well ? That city of theirs has been dead about 1,000 years . Who were they , I wonder ? How did they live ? - Jeff ? - I 'll be back . Where you going ? Spender ? Where the hell have you been for the last week ? I 'm the last Martian . You 're the ... Dear God . Is this the way it 's going to be ? Monsters ! We come with God . No , wait ! Come back ! You saved me . You wouldn 't let me die . The more you look , the more I become this ! I am not what I seem . I am not that vision . - You 're comin ' home with me ! - Wait a minute ! This man is my prisoner . The man is wanted for murder . No , this is my husband ! - No , that 's my Lavinnia . - No , it 's David . Stop it ! He 's a Martian ! A Martian ! This is for you . Hit the dirt ! Sam ? The Earth is dead , but are there people still alive ? Caverns miles deep could shelter life from the terrible blast . This is Wilder 's hope as he races to his brother 's rescue , but what will survival mean now on Earth or on Mars ? Recreation break for those on the midnight shift begins in one half hour . Note ... number three gymnasium remains closed indefinitely for all racquet sports . Switch to arm . Arm light on . Switching command to internal . Minus 1 : 30 . Minus 1 : 25 . Minus 1 : 20 . - Status check . Come in on intel . - Affirmative . - Telemetry in launch condition ? - Affirmative . - Missile and internal D. C ? - Affirmative . - Pressurization complete ? - Affirmative . T minus 60 seconds and counting . Switch to arm . Status check . Green safety arm light on ? Affirmative . - Greens ready ? - Ready . - Water system ready ? - Affirmative . I have a complete light . Box tanking secured ? T minus 20 ... Damn it ! There 's a whole fleet of ' em ! Where the hell are the ABMs ? They 're our last defense . God ! Damn them ! And just as there is stillness in what was once this nerve center on Earth ... so there is a small and silent town on the far side of Mars . Lonely lights burn in the stores all day , and shop doors are unlocked , as if people have run off without using their keys . Debris and memories decay in the still streets . The town is dead except for Ben Driscoll . Oh , my God ! Hello . Could 've come from any one of these . It wasn 't anybody calling though . A pole blew down somewhere ... activated the circuit ... and you rang all by yourself , didn 't you ? She won 't call back . Why should she call the same number twice ? Nobody answers . She 's probably calling other houses , other cities . I had my chance . Why do I say " she " ? Wait a minute . Settle down . It was over here . Directory . All right . Let 's start with the A 's . " Amelia Arnold . " " Sally Ames . " " Julie Appleby . " " Livingstone , Fred . " " Livingstone , Gladys . " Hello . This is Gladys Livingstone . Hi , Gladys . This is Benjamin . I am not at home right now . If you would care to leave a message , wait for the tone before speaking . I would be glad to leave a message , Gladys . Go to hell ! If I was a woman ... and I was the only one left on Mars ... where would I be ? A beauty salon ! All right . Beauty salon . Okay , let 's see here . Hello ? Is this a recording ? There is somebody left on Mars ! There is ! My God ! Your name ... what 's your name ? Genevieve Selsor . What 's your name ? Driscoll . Benjamin Driscoll . Benjamin . Hello ! - Hello . - Where are you ? New Texas City . So far away . Is it ? You stay right there . Don 't move . All right . You hear me ? Don 't move . I 'll be right there . All right . But Driscoll and Genevieve are not the only people left on Mars with the sudden exodus . A few isolated colonists remain , scattered over the planet , waiting and watching , hoping and praying ... wondering what is left of Earth and what is to become of them in the now-deserted Martian colonies . Would there be a final rescue effort ? Tonight , Peter Hathaway searches the Martian sky hoping and praying and wondering . Alice ! Marguerite ! Come out ! Come out quickly ! They 've come ! They 're here ! Look ! We 're saved ! We 're saved ! Look ! Look ! It 's them , all right . We 're saved . You remember the drill ? - Marguerite ? - I know , Father . - I 'll check the circuits . - Good . And then ? - The deck chairs . - The deck ... chairs ? ! It 's all right , Peter . I 'll show her what to do if necessary . You shouldn 't expect so much of her . I 'll try radio contact . You inspect the big board . Circuits . Mayday , Mayday . This is 6295 . They don 't seem to be answering . I didn 't ask you . You and Marguerite have checked everything ? - Checked and rechecked . - Thank God . - This is our last chance . - Our last chance . - Everything ready ? - Yes , everything 's ready . Good . Oh , my ! Hi . I 'm sorry . My nails are wet . You wouldn 't happen to be free , would you , tonight ? You wouldn 't be trying to pick me up now , would you ? Oh , no . Just a date . I promise . That 's all . Just a date . Well , I 'll just have to think about that now , won 't I ? - Right here . - Let 's sit over there . Of course . Over there . Excuse me . There . You look marvelous ... just marvelous . Thank you . Can we have a cocktail ? Cocktail ? Of course . Here we go . Could we sit at that table over there ? Of course . - You really are gorgeous . - Thank you . This is my good side . Both sides look good to me . To us . Does my hair look all right in the back ? Yes . I hope so . I had such a terrible time trying to give myself a permanent , and then , trying to style it . You know , it 's funny how you always think how nice it would be to be alone . What ? I said , it 's funny how you always think how nice it would be ... Oh , it 's sour ! I 'm sorry . I made it wrong ? I like it sweet . And what about some food ? Sweet . Of course . Too sweet . Champagne . Genevieve . Don 't you like it ? I just can 't eat that much . I have to watch my figure . You got a perfect figure . Oh , no . If I don 't go to the club at least twice a day and work out and use the steam room and the pool , I just grow pounds on . It 's terrible . I just wish there was still a masseuse at the club . I could really use a good massage to stimulate my blood cells . I could stimulate your blood cells . Oh , no . You have to have experience . Massaging is an art . Oh , dear ! This dress is cut all wrong . I know it . That 's the trouble with living on Mars ... the latest fashions just don 't get here soon enough . You know there was a war on Earth ? Yes , I know . Isn 't it terrible ? Yeah . You want another cocktail , or how about some champagne ? Oh , no . One is my limit . There 's terrible calories in a cocktail . Yeah . - Why didn 't you leave Mars ? - What ? Why didn 't you leave Mars ? Well ... They wouldn 't let me take all my clothes . I didn 't leave because I was in the mountains . I didn 't know everybody was going . What ? Nothing . Don 't you ever get lonely ? Yes ! That 's why I was so glad to hear from you . You were ? Oh , yes . It 's hard being alone . I know . I mean , you have to make all your own meals , for one thing . This is the first decent food I 've had in months . Then , too , if something breaks down in the beauty shop or at home , I can 't fix it . I have so many things for you to fix , you just wouldn 't believe it . You have ? Oh , yes . - It 's getting late . - Oh , is it ? I didn 't get much sleep last night . I flew 1,500 miles just to see you . That far ? And ... I 'd like to go to bed now . All right . - My fur . - Oh , your fur , yes . I love having all the stores to go to and not paying for anything . I have every makeup known to woman in my house . I moved to a better house , of course . Of course . I think I 've cleared out every shop in town , too . My closets just won 't hold another outfit . - I must have 100 pairs of shoes . - What about the bed ? And jewelry ... earrings , brooches , rings and necklaces . I just love fine stones ... diamonds , rubies , emeralds . I have such a collection , you wouldn 't believe it . Well , good night . Thank you for dinner . Why don 't you stay in one of those houses across the street ? Why don 't I ... Come over tomorrow about noon , and we can have some brunch . I 'm so glad you can cook . Then I 'll show you all the things I have that need repairing . It 's going to be so good to have a man around . I wonder if you can fix the sauna at the club . If you can do that ... oh , how I need it ! So do I ! Wait a minute , buster . Just because we 're the last two people on Mars doesn 't give you the right to come on with me . Well , I 'll forgive you just this one time . Now , don 't forget ... noon . Why don 't you go to the hardware store before you go to bed tonight and pick up some tools . I have a few , but they 're not good enough for the work I have that needs to be done . And try to pick up something good for breakfast ... maybe you could make some waffles . I can only eat half , but I do love them and coffee . I could use a new coffeemaker . I just love black coffee in the morning . Good night . Driscoll , thoroughly disenchanted , flies away into the Martian wilderness , vowing never to return . He flies all night . He flies for a week and a day . He flies until he 's put 10,000 miles between himself and Genevieve Selsor and has swept her from his mind . Still , he can find no peace . I suppose there 's not much left on Earth anyway . Don 't worry , Peter . Haven 't you got everything you 'd ever want right here ? Oh , yes , of course . I do . Still , if only ... they 'd seen us last week . Still , mustn 't give up hope . - You must never give up hope . - That 's true . I have gin . I 'm gonna take a little walk . Be back in a few minutes . I 'll pick up some more firewood . The rocket ! It 's the rocket . They 've come back ! They 've come back to take us home ! They 'll be here by morning . You see ? Never give up hope . Lazarus , come forth . Wine ! We 'll have a delicious meal ready for them when they land . I 've kept all this for just this occasion . I knew it 'd come someday . Meanwhile ... Meanwhile , let us celebrate . You remember the day the war began ? How could we forget ? All the rockets were called home , and we were up in the mountains . We were the only ones left . Oh , Lord , how the years go by . You know , I couldn 't have stood it without you . Both of you . I think I would 've killed myself without you . But with you , it was worth waiting . - I know it 's been hard sometimes ... - Peter , please . You know we wouldn 't have wanted to have it otherwise . I feel the same way . Well , then ... Here 's to us ... all three of us , and ... to our long wait together . Hello ! Over here ! There . Father ? I know that man . - You do ? - Yes . - Colonel ! Colonel Wilder ! - Peter ! - Peter Hathaway . - Hathaway , yes . I thought you 'd left for Earth . - Peter , this is Father Stone . - Hello , Father . - It 's so good to see you . - You 're looking fine . - I 'm getting a little old . - I 'm not any younger myself . I 'm a lot older since I 've been back to Earth . Now look , what are our chances of getting back there ? We 've been waiting years to go home . We missed the ships , and my family ... I 'm sorry , Peter . We 'll be here for quite a while , I 'm afraid . You 're welcome to stay with us . Oh , that 'd be ... all of us ? - Yes . How 's your wife ? - She 's fine . - And you had a child . - Yes , a daughter . Yes , I remember . They 're fine ? They 're waiting for us down at the hut . We 've got a great meal waiting for you . - Come along . - Thank you . Colonel , do you remember Spender ? I 'll never forget him . About once a year , I walk past his grave . I suppose he finally got what he wanted , because he never wanted us to come up here . I suppose he 's happy now that almost all of us have left . I 'm sorry . It 's just the excitement . - Are you all right ? - Yes . I 'll be all right . It 's just the waiting , the excitement . It 's as if I 'd stayed alive all these years just for this day . It 's so good to see you again , to hear your voices . I feel better now . Come on . Alice . Come see who 's here . Alice , you remember Colonel Wilder ? Of course , Colonel Wilder . Mrs. Hathaway , yes . I remember . And this is Father Stone . - Father Stone . - How do you do ? Colonel Wilder , my daughter Marguerite . With pleasure . How old are you , Marguerite ? Fourteen . I see . Come along . Make yourselves at home . Colonel , Father . Right over here . Please sit down . You have no idea what a delight it is ... I beg your pardon . I forgot ... drinks . Excuse me . Father ... - This can 't be right . - What can 't be right ? I knew Hathaway years ago . I was at their wedding . Their daughter has to be 20 , 22 years old . And Alice ... she hasn 't changed at all ... not one wrinkle . Do you suppose ... Here , what are you talking about so seriously ? We 're all together , the trip is over , and it 's like home . - Thank you . - You 're right , Mrs. Hathaway . And may I say , you 're looking as pretty as ever . Mars must agree with you . Isn 't that just like a man ? Keep the conversation going . I 'll be right back . Where are you going ? Just out to check our bearings , make my report . Well , now ... wine . Our studies were fascinating ... so fascinating indeed that we missed our ride back to Earth . Alice , do you remember that fossil we unearthed ? - I remember . - So do I. Come along , Father . This fossil must 've been at least 100,000 years old . Colonel , sit down , please . 100,000 years old , and yet , it was so perfectly preserved ... well , I 'll show you . I 've been out back behind the tower . - What for ? - Two crosses were there . Alice and Marguerite ... Dead from an unknown virus , July 2000 A.D. - That 's seven years ago . - Yes . - Then who are they ? - Who else would they be ? There now ! Father , I know . - Why don 't you take it ? - Oh , I couldn 't . - No , please . - I couldn 't . For the church . And now , a toast . My dears . A toast . To all of you . It 's good to be among friends again . And especially to my dear wife and daughter , without whom I could never have survived . It 's only because of your loving companionship that I have been able to be here for your arrival . Careful . No , no . Careful . Easy . Colonel ... I 'm sorry I spoiled the party . Please , don 't . Don 't call them . They wouldn 't understand , and I wouldn 't want them to understand . Do you know what just happened ? Something about my husband ? Yes . He 's dead . His heart . I see . How do you feel ? He didn 't want us to feel badly . He told us this would happen one day . He didn 't want us to cry . He didn 't teach us how . You know . He didn 't want us to know . He said it was the worst thing that could happen to a man ... to know how to be lonely and know how to be sad and then to cry . So we 're not to know what crying is . Or sadness . He was so proud of us . At times , he almost forgot that he had made us . He took us and loved us as his real wife and child . In a way , we are . You must 've been a great comfort to him . For years , we sat and talked . He so much loved to talk . He liked this hut and the open fire . We could 've lived in a regular house in town , but he preferred it here where he could be primitive when he liked . He told me all about his lab and the things he did there . He wired the entire dead town below with speakers . When he pressed a button , the town lit up and made noise as if 10,000 people lived there . Every Sunday evening , we 'd sit in the deck chairs and watch his light show . He programmed Marguerite to enjoy it the most . And he would sit and light a cigar and talk to us . Every once in a while , the phone would ring and a recorded voice would ask Mr. Hathaway scientific and surgical questions , and he would answer them . With the phone ringin and us here and the sounds of the town and his cigar he was quite happy . There was only one thing he couldn 't make us do . Grow old . He grew older and weaker every day , but we stayed the same . I guess he didn 't mind . I guess he wanted us this way . We 'll bury him with his family . I think he would 've liked it that way . I guess we 'll take them with us . No . You can 't just leave them here . - I really think we should . - Alone ? How would they survive ? I really don 't think that is our concern . That was the decision of their creator . What do you mean ? They have a right to live , just as much as you and I ... but their own life ... the life that they were created to live . Their souls ... belong to Hathaway . I don 't think they 'd understand anything else . They 'll eventually die without our help . I 'll say good-bye . Mother , when will my father come back ? I don 't know , darling . Perhaps never . What will we do ? - We 'll continue waiting . - For what ? I don 't know . He never told me . Good morning , ladies . I 'm Ben Driscoll . I don 't mean to impose . It 's just that it 's been a long time since I 've seen another human being . Make yourself at home , Mr. Driscoll . Thank you . Don 't put yourself out none . I mean , I don 't need a lot of entertaining or even much conversation . I just want a place to stay ... a nice , family feeling . Then you have come to the right place , Mr. Driscoll . Precisely . Hello , Sam . You back from Earth ? Yeah . Well ... Thank you , Sam . How 's Elma ? Well , she 's not well . She took to her bed the night the war started , and she hasn 't been up since . Whatever happened to your brother 's family down in the States ? They 're dead . Ah , hell . What about the rest of ' em ? It 's over , Sam . Earth is done with . Mars is all we have now . Tell me , what 's half of nothin ' ? What ? That 's what I got ... half of nothin ' . That 's what they give me ... half of nothin ' . What is that ? That 's a land grant from the Martians . - You saw Martians ? - Oh , yeah . When ? Well , let 's see ... it was the day you left . They showed up here in their sand ships and they just give me that . - Did they speak to you ? - Oh , yeah . What did they say ? They didn 't say much . They just handed me that scroll there and said , " This land is yours . " " This land is yours . " As much good as it does me . Then there are Martians still alive . We will get a chance to talk to them . No , I don 't think so . Why do you say that ? They 're weird . They didn 't look real to me . So when I fired on ... What ? ! What did you say ? I thought they was gonna attack me , so I fired just on one of ' em . All this time ... all I wanted was to come in contact with a living Martian ... speak with him , learn from him . Why did they come to you ? I don 't know . Unless it was to warn me about the war . - Did they ? - No , not exactly . He just said , " Tonight is the night . " It was that night that the war began . Yes . They must be the Martians . Only they would know . Look , this is real , isn 't it ? Yeah , it 's real . It 's worthless , but it 's real . Martians have to be real . And this isn 't worthless . Yeah ? They knew what was going to happen on Earth . Maybe they 're allowing us to start over here . But they killed our first two expeditions , remember ? We destroyed them with chickenpox . Maybe they decided there 's enough here for what remains of both worlds . What 's the point of destroying two civilizations ? You know you 're beginning to talk like Spender . I understand Spender . I want you to tell me everything you remember about the Martians ... every last detail . The answer 's all here . Hello . What did you say ? I don 't understand you . There . That 's better . You do speak English . I do now . That must be the way they spoke to Sam . He 's a friend . This is a wondrous moment . - Is it ? - Yes . My God , you 're a ghost ! What ? You 're a ghost . - Me ? - You . No . Where are you from ? - Earth . - What 's that ? It 's a planet . Up there . Planet of ghosts . I 'm not a ghost . I 'm alive . You 're dead . Your people were destroyed by a plague . You must be mad . Don 't you see this city ? I see the ruins of the city ... dead over 1,000 years . 1,000 years ? I live here . - Your city 's dead . - It 's alive . Don 't you see the carnival lights , the boats , the women ? - Can 't you see them ? - No . You don 't see the city , the ocean beyond ? There hasn 't been an ocean there for over 40 centuries . This can mean only one thing . It has to do with time . You 're a figment of the past . You are from the past . - What year is it ? - 2007 . That means nothing to me . To me , it is the year 4462853 SEC , and you are long dead . But I can feel my heartbeat . Feel . No , never mind . I can feel my own flesh . So do I. And I was hoping finally ... Finally what ? That I could speak to a Martian ... ask him questions . Here I am . Speak to me . Ask . I 'll tell you anything you want to know about my world . Your world is dead . It is your world that is dead . Perhaps you 're right . How can you prove you 're from the future ? How do you know these ruins that you see are not the ruins of your own civilization , 100 centuries from now ? You cannot know . You 're right . I cannot . What does it matter anyway ? Of what importance is it who is past and who is future ? What follows will follow , now or in 10,000 years . All that matters is ... you see your world and I see mine . Is that not enough , no matter what we each believe ? Of course . You look despondent . - I guess I am . - Why ? - Because I 'd hoped ... - For what ? For this meeting ... such a long time . To learn . To learn ? Yes , about your people . Your beliefs . The secret of your life on Mars . On Tir . This is the planet Tir . Yes . Tir . Secret ? There is no secret . Anyone with eyes can see the way to live . - How ? - By watching life ... observing nature and cooperating with it . Making common cause with the process of existence . How ? By living life for itself , don 't you see ? Deriving pleasure from the gift of pure being . The gift of pure being . Life is its own answer . Accept it and enjoy it day by day . Live as well as possible . Expect no more . Destroy nothing , humble nothing , look for fault in nothing . Leave unsullied and untouched all that is beautiful . Hold that which lives in all reverence . For life is given by the sovereign of our universe ... given to be savored , to be luxuriated in , to be respected . But that 's no secret . You 're intelligent . You know as well as I what has to be done . Now I must go . My people are waiting for me . I have people waiting , too . Good . Perhaps we 'll meet again some other night . And I would like to see that carnival of yours . And I would like to see the things you see . Good night ... my friend . Good-bye . Wilder leaves the Martian , and leaves his dream as well ... his dream of sharing this new world with a few survivors of the race which had existed here for eons . The night is dark , the moons have descended , starlight twinkles on the empty landscape where there is no sound but the roar of his own engine shattering the darkness . No living thing . Nothing . Hey , what 's the matter with you two ? There 's nothing to do around here . Well , why don 't you watch one of your movies on the wall monitor ? - One of your old Westerns . - No . We 've played them all a million times . Yeah . I know . Come on , cheer up . I 'll think of something . Hey , you okay ? What 's the matter ? Something 's wrong . What is it ? Please tell me . Last night , I was wondering if we would be able to carry on here . There are so few of us left , and each of us not wanting to leave his little piece of Mars . Parkhill waiting for customers that will never come , Father Stone saying Mass every day to nobody but himself . I was wondering if we had made a mistake . Now I know we didn 't . Not if you can enjoy life ... and take pleasure from the gift of pure being . That 's a lovely thought . I want you to pack everything of value ... everything you think we might need . Tell the children to do the same . We 'll load it in the boat . I 'll be back in a little while . - Why ? - We 're leaving this place . Where are we going ? Where it all started . Still bored ? Your daddy 's got a surprise for you . - A surprise ? - What is it , Mom ? How would you like to go camping ? Just the four of us , like we used to ? - You mean it ? - When ? As soon as you get off your backside and start packing ! Come on ! Here we go . All right ? Let 's go . You know what you 're going to see today ? - What ? - Martians . - When ? - You 'll see . - What do they look like , Dad ? - You 'll know when you see them . How far are we going , Dad ? Four million years . In fact , if things get any worse , I may put in for a transfer myself . What are you thinking about , Dad ? Memories . Of what ? The things that took us to this moment . All right . A race creates itself for a million years , then it dies ... part in its own time , with dignity , but what about the other part ? When are we stopping , Dad ? - Pick a spot . - What do you mean ? - Tell me where you wanna stop . - Right here . You 're just saying that ' cause you 're tired of ridin ' in the boat . - That 's right . - I want a place with Martians in it . You 'll have that . - Are they here ? - Yes . - Where ? - You 'll see . Let 's stop here then . Marie , Robert , is this place all right with you ? No ! - Aren 't you and Mom gonna vote ? - We 'll let you kids decide . This is fine , Dad . All right . This is it then . Here we go . That 's it . Come on , honey . Doesn 't it bother you ... the idea of them watching us make fools of ourselves ? - Who ? - The Martians . Will you do whatever you can to keep them from tearing this planet apart ? - Are there Martians here ? - You 'll see them soon . You know , you kids made a good choice . This is going to be our new home . What do you mean ? Aren 't we all goin ' back ? No , we 're gonna stay right here . What ? We 're going to learn the Martian way of life , we 're going to learn their language , and learn how they lived so well . - Dad ! - I think it may be a bit too soon . All right . We won 't move here right away . We 'll go back to our old house until we 've all decided that we want to move here forever . But this is going to be our new home . - And our new school . - School ? ! Come on , let 's set up camp . I 'm saying it may have been a Martian . There 's one in First Town right now . Life is its own answer . Accept it and enjoy it day by day . Why you burnin ' those papers , Dad ? Why ? I 'm burning what 's behind us . Burning a way of life . Same way of life burned on Earth . You know , life there never did really amount to much . People got greedier and greedier . Wars got bigger and bigger until finally ... Tell me what happened . So we 're going to strike out in a whole new direction . Find a new way of life here on Mars . And learn to live . That 's what has to be done . I 'll show you those Martians now . Wow ! - They 're here ? - They 're here . Under the duck ? - No . - Where then ? There . Those are the Martians .

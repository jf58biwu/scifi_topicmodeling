Did your review of the archives come up with anything significant ? Only two points , as a matter of fact , my dear boy : Arkadis was thought to be a planetary paradise , often referred to as a benign twin of Earth : Now , the last attempt of colonization : : : Was led by a MajorJason Samos : Samos ? Outstanding fellow he was , actually ... founder of the back-to-the-land movement , all that sort of thing : Established successful colonies on half a dozen other worlds : Except that he didn 't succeed on Arkadis : Well , you see , no one knows that for certain : For 10 years , he sent back glowing reports from Arkadis : Then about six years ago , it must have been , all communications from that planet ceased : I can 't remember the precise date of the last message : 8 : 42 a : M : , Greenwich mean time , July 17 , 2485 : Oh , mind your own business : Drives you mad , that fellow , doesn 't he ? Makes you feel like a fool all the time : - Are you certain you don 't want me to go with you , Buck ? - Yes , Hawk : You and Wilma are gonna be busy enough completing that asteroid sweep in 10 days without worrying about me : Besides , maybe when I get back from Arkadis I 'll have some information about what happened to Major Samos : Oh , I do hope so : I do hope so : I 'll look forward to that : I will indeed , Buck : Bye-bye : See you later , Doctor : I don 't know why : He just asked me if I 'd like to go down to Arkadis with him , and I said I would , and it 's all set : Your shuttlecraft is all set to go , Buck : Twiki tells me you 're taking him with you : That 's right : I would 've been glad to take you along , Wilma , but this planet has three moons : Meaning ? Well , I know how you are in moonlight , and , uh , I only got 10 days to complete this mission : You 're gonna regret that remark , Buck : [ Chirping ] Are you really different in the moonlight ? No , sweetie : But I will be from now on : I hope you two will be very happy together : [ Woodwind ] [ Stops ] [ Roars ] [ Snorting ] [ Growling ] " On this site , April 25 , in the year 2475 , " MajorJason Samos established the Earth colony of New Corinth , " numbering 116 souls : May God bless this venture : " - Kinda gives you a funny feeling , doesn 't it , Twiki ? - [ Chirping ] Sure does , Buck : It 's sad , very sad : All the hopes , all the dreams , reduced to this : [ Woodwind , Distant ] What was that ?

[ Howling ] [ Groans , Sighs ] You 're hurt : I 'll live : What kind of an animal was that , anyway ? Could be a zewolf , Buck : They 're supposed to be native to Arkadis : Well , maybe you better clue me in as to what other kinds of specimens I might run into on this planet : That 's easy : Human male , age approximately nine years : What ? Where ? Right behind you at the moment : Well , who are you ? Delph , sir : Delph Samos : I saw what you did to the zewolf , and it was wonderful : Well , thank you : Thank you : " Samos , " huh ? You by any chance related to , uh , MajorJason Samos who founded this colony ? Yes , sir : He was my father : He 's dead now : Oh : I 'm sorry to hear that : Oh , my name 's Captain Buck Rogers , and this is my friend Twiki : Pleased to meet ya : You 're bleeding : Oh , that 's all right : Tell me something : Are there any other people on this planet ? No , just my mother and me : No other settlers , huh ? No : Mother says they all left years ago : You 're not going to leave right away , are you ? No : I hadn 't intended to : Then please come to our house : My mother can fix your arm for you , and she 's a very good cook , and we 've got plenty of room : [ Chuckling ] All right : You 've made yourself a deal : Besides , I 'd like to meet your mother and talk to her : And I could use a home cooked meal too : Twiki ? Yes , Buck : - Stay here and keep an eye on the ship , all right ? - Okay , Buck : Lead on , Delph : - Did you really come from a starship ? - That 's right : It 's called the Searcher : We 're looking for the lost tribes of Earth : " Lost tribes " ? Your mother must have told you that right after the holocaust , people left the Earth to colonize other planets : Well , a couple of hundred years ago , the Earth lost contact with those early colonists : Now we 're trying to find out what happened to them , reestablish contact , hoping that maybe , well ... Oh , there 's my mother : Her name is Syra : Come on : [ Buck ] Okay : Mother ! That 's Captain Buck Rogers : He 's from the starship Searcher : Happy to meet you , ma 'am : Hello : Delph : You promised , if I let you go , you 'd stay hidden till the spaceship left : I was hiding , Mother , but Captain Rogers was hurt : What happened ? It was a zewolf , Mother : That arm should be tended to : There are strange viruses here on this planet : - Please come to the house : Delph , you stay and finish up here : - Oh ! I 'm sorry if I haven 't been very hospitable , Captain : It 's just ... It 's better if you don 't stay here : You can see there 's ... there 's very little room , and we 're barely managing : You 're welcome to share my supplies : And if you 'd like , you can leave with me when the Searcher comes back : Well , thank you , but this is our home : Suit yourself : - Feels better already : - It 's a wild herb : It has unusually fast healing properties : From the looks of it , you ... Don 't : [ Sighs ] I 'm sorry : I 'm afraid I don 't react very well to being touched : [ Sighs ] Well ... [ Grunts ] That was absolutely fantastic : Thank you : Bread sprouts and corn gourds with roseberries baked on top : Mm : We find them in the woods : It 's nice to see the land provides for you : When my father scouted this planet , he made sure : : : That everything would be here for everybody : You know what , Captain Rogers ? I still have my father 's logbook : I 'll get it and show you : He sleeps with it under his pillow : He dreams someday of being able to do everything his father 's done : I never met Major Samos , but from everything I 've heard about him , I wish I had : Here it is : It shows all the places he 's been : [ Woodwind , Distant ] I heard that sound when we first landed : What is it ? [ Continues ] It 's nothing : It 's the wind : [ Continues ] You all right , Delph ? Yes , sir : I 'm all right : : : Now : I 've never even been in a spaceship before , let alone be flying it : Well , so far you 're doing a great job : One of these days you 'll be a fine pilot : Hey , better let me take over right now : We 're almost over your house : Aye , aye , Captain : [ Footsteps ] [ Engine Whining , Approaching ] [ Growling ] [ Continues Growling ] [ Steed Roars ] Ah : There we go , huh ? Well , I 'm glad you had a good time : [ Chuckles ] Mother ! Mother ! You 'll never guess what I just did ! [ Pouring ] Mother ! Mother ! Oh : I flew the shuttle : I really flew it : Buck let me handle the controls , and he 's teaching me about flying and guidance and propulsion systems and ... Whoa : You mustn 't pester the captain too much now , huh ? Oh , it 's no trouble , ma 'am : He 's really a fine boy : - He and Twiki are getting along really well : - Twiki ? Oh , Twiki 's my robot : I left him on board the ship : He 's awful cute , Mother : And he 's little ... not even as big as I am : [ Chuckles ] I 'm going to help him and Buck with the names of all the plants and animals around here : Oh , he 's already started : Got some right here : [ Syra ] That 's nice : You better go wash up for supper now : This is amberfire , and , uh ... - Uh , " amberleaf : " - Oh , amberleaf : Uh , then this must be : : : Devil 's fire : Right : Okay : And this must be , um ... Flute grass : Because you can play it like a flute : Like this : Flute grass : - [ Woodwind ] - [ Syra ] Delph ... [ Clatters ] I told you never to do that : I 'm sorry , Mother : I forgot : It 's all right , Delph : It 's all right : [ Pangor Growls ] [ Chirping ] What is it , Twiki ? There 's something coming , Buck : It 's out there at the edge of the woods : [ Sighs ] Another zewolf ? I can 't tell : All right : - [ Steed Roars ] - [ Growls ] Buck , we 've been hit : Our controls have been shorted out : [ Hoofbeats Departing ] [ Sizzling ] So where does this : : : Man ... if you can call him that ... come from ? He lives in the woods : Nothing that goes on around here escapes him : Keeps bothering us ... taking things from us : Calls himself Pangor : But I don 't know what that is : It 's probably another name for " satyr " ... half goat , half man : I never thought I 'd see one , outside of statues of ancient mythology : I wish I was big enough to fight him : I won 't have more fighting : Captain Rogers has already been injured once : I won 't have him hurt again : Captain , that was one reason I wanted you to leave Arkadis right away : I still do : That might be a trifle difficult at the moment ... [ Sighs ] With half my ship 's controls and all of its communications out : - I wasn 't planning on taking off and leaving you two behind here anyway : - Even if I insisted ? Why should you insist ? You 're obviously in trouble here and have been for quite a while : Delph , would you do me a favor ? - Would you get my toolbox for me ? It 's right outside the door of the ship : - Sure : - I 'm not getting the whole story here , am I ? - It 's true : He 's been troubling us a long time : - What is he , some kind of mutant ? - Mutant ? Is he one of a kind , or are there others like him ? There are a few others , but we hardly ever see them here : They seem to stake out their own territory and stay there : And I think they 're afraid of Pangor : Well , I can 't say that I blame them : Packs quite a thunderbolt in that whip of his : Is that what frightened the other colonists away ? We were all terrified : Six years ago , everybody voted to leave and settle on some other planet : Their ship didn 't make it : - What stopped you from going with them ? - My husband : He , uh , had this dream , right up to the end , that he could somehow turn this place into a : : : Garden of Eden : - But after he died , you must have had plenty of chances to leave here : - Then I couldn 't : [ Woodwind ] [ Continues ] He 's out there ... a satyr and his feralon ... always watching this house : Let him watch ... all he wants to : - I get Twiki fixed and the Scout refitted , we 're getting out of here ... all of us : - No : This is my husband 's home : This is where I stay : Maybe you can take Delph : I couldn 't bear parting with him before , when he was so little : Maybe now it 's getting to be time : Mother , I 'm not going anywhere without you : I 'm not : Something to think about : [ Growls ] [ Electronic Buzzing , Whistling ] [ Chirping ] Ouch : [ Giggles ] Oh , hello , there : I thought I 'd lost my little compadre : [ Clicks ] Hey , easy , Buck : That tickles : [ Giggles ] Well , welcome back , Twiki : He 's fixed : Well , not quite , but he 's on his way : Davis , try to raise Captain Rogers again : It is useless : Arkadis passed into perihelion 17 minutes ago , meaning it is at its closest approach to the sun : I know what perihelion means , you rust bucket : What 's that got to do with our being unable to speak to Captain Rogers ? Really , Admiral : When Arkadis is in perihelion , it is in a state of total eclipse relative to our present position : - No communication will be possible for another 12 hours : - Why didn 't you tell me that 17 minutes ago ? You didn 't ask : Admiral , are we going to abort the rest of the asteroid sweep ? Well , I 'm of two minds : If we abort and there 's nothing wrong , we 're going to look like idiots : I 'd put my trust in Buck , Admiral : There 's not much he can 't handle : All right : You and Hawk carry on until further notice : I suppose we can afford to wait until that planet comes out of perihelion : [ Crank Squeaking ] [ Crank Continues ] Please excuse me : Moon wine has to be made quickly when the grapes are ready : Tell me the truth , Syra : It 's all for him , isn 't it ? For Pangor : If he 's supplied with enough , he 's content : : : And he goes off and he leaves me alone : : : For a little while : So you appease him ? I have to , or he might hurt Delph : Well , then tell me something : Why do you still refuse to leave ? Because I can 't : Would you please : : : Just let me finish my work ? [ Sobs ] [ Twiki ] Hi , Delph : Hi , Twiki : It must be so nice , Captain Rogers , to fly all over the universe and see everything : Well , it 's got its points , Delph : Like being free , isn 't it ... things ahead of you you don 't know about ? There 's a whole lot of truth to that : [ Chuckles ] [ Syra Screaming ] No : ! No : ! No : ! Mother ! Get inside quick : Move ! No : ! No : ! Pangor ! - [ Growls ] - Leave the woman alone , or I 'll kill ya ! No ! You be killed : I don 't think so , Pangor : Look : Throw gun away : Throw : ! Or this one will feel Pangor 's whip : Throw gun now ! [ Buck ] Get in the house , quick : ! [ Whip Arcing ] Syra , bolt the door : ! [ Pangor Growling ] Pangor the coward : Fights women and children : - Come on ! - Now we see : Come on , Pangor : You 're nothing without your whip : - Come on : Come get me : - [ Growling Continues ] Pangor the coward : ! Kill : Kill ! Kill ! Where are you ? Close ? Yes , close ! Pangor 's whip will sniff you out : [ Yells ] [ Whip Arcing ] [ Grunts ] [ Groaning , Straining ] Is it true ? He 's really drowned ? Well , it sure looked that way : Wow : I knew you could do it : I knew from the first time you beat the zewolf , you 'd be the one to beat Pangor : That 's why I wanted you to stay with us : We 're free ofhim Mother ... really and truly free : Yes : Free : Aren 't you happy , Mother ? I 'm thankful Captain Rogers came through it all right : - Delph , go and get some fresh water from the well : - Yes , Mother : He asked if you were happy , and you said , " We 're thankful : " There 's a difference : I 'm thankful we 're free of him : I 'm never happy over the death of anyone : Yes , but I don 't think you would mourn for everyone : And yet you mourn for this Pangor : Why ? Part of me is relieved he 's dead ... more than I can tell : Another part of me can 't help grieving for him : You grieve for the satyr who brutalized you ? You mind telling me why ? Because once upon a time he was something very different : Once , he was a man ... a good man ... whose name was not Pangor , but MajorJason Samos : Your husband ? My husband : Now you know why I could never bring myself to leave this place : There 's no reason to hide anything anymore : You see , something here turned men into satyrs ... never women or children : And only some of the men : We never found out what caused it : Our own family stayed on here after all the others voted to leave : My husband was so obsessed with the pioneer dream : And then time came : : : When he was affected too : Over the space of hours : : : I watched him change : : : Into that half-animal thing you had to kill today , Captain : Changed from this civilized man ... this wonderful , dedicated human being I was married to : And of course I worry about Delph : I 'm afraid it could happen to him too when he becomes a man : [ Sighs ] [ Quietly ] I 'm sorry : Terribly sorry , Syra : Delph never knew : He won 't find out from you , will he Captain ? How could I tell him that I killed his father ? Captain : - Oh , my God : - What 's the matter ? Your eyes : It was the satyr bite : Leave this place , Buck : Leave it and go back to your ship for help : We 're all gonna get out of here : Mother , what 's the matter ? Where 's Captain Rogers going ? This is Searcher calling Hawk 's ship and Colonel Deering : Searcher to Hawk and Colonel Deering : Come in , please : - [ Wilma ] This is Deering : - [ Hawk ] Hawk , here : I am aborting this mission : We 've been trying for almost 30 minutes to reach Buck with no success : I 'm turning Searcher to a median intercept course : Return as soon as possible : [ Wilma ] On our way , Admiral : [ Hawk , On Speaker ] Coming home : Any luck yet , Twiki ? No , ma 'am : Still a few things left to fix up , but we 're gettin ' there : [ Footsteps Running , Approaching ] What 's happening ? Was Buck working out here all night ? Oh , please tell me what 's the matter : Delph , try to understand : Buck ... he 's getting very sick : Captain Rogers , my mother said you ... Delph ... [ Coughs ] Please : : : Don 't be frightened of me : - Buck , somebody 's comin . ! - [ Growling ] Pangor gone : Now we take the woman and wine : That settles it : I can 't wait any longer : Twiki , deploy shielding : Get ready to lift off : We 'll try to hold to Searcher 's old course : Hope to meet ' em coming back : You two , get on board that ship now : [ Delph ] Wait : ! My father 's logbook ... I 've got to get that too : Delph , no ! - [ Growling Continues ] - Delph ! [ Buck ] No : ! Put me down ! Put me down ! [ Delph ] Mother ! Buck !

Keep boy : ! Wine ! [ Growls ] - What 'll they do to Delph ? - Nothing : They know they have a bargaining point as long as they hold Delph : They want what Pangor had : His wine and his woman : I planted the idea in their heads , about the wine being here : I 'll see that they get a reception : What are you going to do ? I have enough gelanite to blow this place sky-high : We have a lot of work to do : [ Growling Low ] - How much longer do you think it 'll be before they come ? - Not : : : Long : You really believe this can work , Captain ? If they think they 're safe , they 'll come for the wine , forget about the boy : All right , it 's all set : We 'll put the detonator out here : I 'll string this wire out : Then , once they 're inside drinking , one touch on this detonator and they 're gone : [ Groans , Growling ] [ Growling , Distant ] Delph ! No ! You mustn 't go out there : They 're fighting among themselves for some reason : Get in the ship and wait for me : I 'll bring Delph back if I can : [ Pangor ] Syra : Syra : [ Screams ] [ Breathing Labored ] Dying , Syra : Something : : : Happened : : : In that lake : Pangor pain : - Starting : : : To remember : - Jason : I 'm ...

No ! - [ Syra ] Jason ! [ Hawk ] What do you think , Crichton ? [ Goodfellow ] Sh : He still has a hundred years of medical archives to review : [ Crichton ] Infecting agent has been isolated : Arbor virus , type AB , variant 246 of caprid encephalitis : [ Goodfellow ] This creates the satyr effect ? [ Crichton ] Inevitably : 246 is a hitchhiker virus , attaching itself to the male " Y ' " chromosome , thus causing caprid symptoms : [ Wilma ] But is the disease reversible ? [ Crichton ] In early stages , affirmative : I recommend antisomal therapy treatment 74484 ... 12,000 units hourly in I : V : Solution : : : For the next 72 hours : Oh : I thought you would want this : [ Sighs ] Back to normal : I was afraid I 'd been changed for good : Wilma stayed with you while you were recovering : It seems you had a most unusual experience : [ Chuckles ] That 's not the half of it : Somebody has been waiting to say good-bye : Hi : The Searcher is orbiting the planet Orion : We 're just about ready to leave for our new home : Mm : Well , Orion is well-colonized : You and Delph should be very happy there : I wish you were coming with us , Captain Rogers : Well , I have to go where the Searcher goes , Delph : - Admiral Asimov enrolled him in the Orion Cadet Academy : - That 's the best there is : I know : My father graduated from there : Well , you grow to be just like your father , all right ? Good pilot , an explorer : [ Crichton , On P : A : ] Passengers for Orion 1 , please report to launch bay : It 's never been easy for me to say good-bye : Hasn 't been easy for me either , especially with you two : We won 't forget you , Buck , either of us : Nor I you : Bye-bye : [ Knocking ] Ah : Hawk said you sat with me every night : Not a bad way to get you alone , is it ? Oh , yeah , but your methods are a little extreme : Oh , you wouldn 't believe what I went through on Arkadis : Running around with horns on my head like some creature out of Greek mythology ... It was incredible : Incredible ? Oh , I don 't know about that : Sounds to me like your true nature was finally showing through : I mean , there are three moons on Arkadis , aren 't there ? - What ? - And , uh , we all know how you are in the moonlight : [ Laughs ]

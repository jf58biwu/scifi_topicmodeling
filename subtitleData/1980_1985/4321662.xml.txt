 LOCKE : Mike starts the ball rolling . He should be smack-dab in the middle of the Golden Triangle . JO : Dangerous territory . LOCKE : And dangerous company . Kill him . ( GRUNTS ) ( SCREAMING ) I 'd feel a lot better if it was me down in that lab . LOCKE : Jo will be okay . The French police established cover . Saint John and the other mules will be here soon and then she 'll be long gone . LOCKE : Mike starts the ball rolling . He should be smack-dab in the middle of the Golden Triangle . He 's managed to work his way into the hill country of Laos . JO : It 's a dangerous territory . LOCKE : And dangerous company . He 'll make the buy and hopefully get some pictures of Curtis . He 's the number one supplier of raw opium in the world . ( LAUGHING ) ( LAUGHING ) Oh , you guys are funny . ( WATCH BEEPING ) ( CHUCKLES ) ( LAUGHING ) Good . Mike 's on his way to meet Curtis . Saint John served under his command in Vietnam . Curtis was dealing heroin to his own troops . When the war ended , he set up his drug empire in the Golden Triangle . Oh , howdy . Welcome to Laos . It 's a nice place to visit , if you know what I mean . Stateside , huh ? That 's right . ( CHUCKLES ) You know what I 'd like to have right now is a good old American hamburger , some fries and a milkshake . I 'll tell you what I 'll do . When I get back stateside I 'll go to a takeout and send you some . Number one brand raw opium . Number one brand cash . Well , I see we understand each other . Looks like . I 'll have my men pack this up for you and ... That 's okay . Well , it 's nice doing business with you . Well , it 's nice being done business with . If you know what I mean . Yeah , this is Curtis . The buyer , he just left here . He 's seen too much . When he arrives , kill him . Home Office to Travelling Man , do you read ? Home Office to Travelling Man , come in . MIKE : This is Travelling Man . I read you I 'm three miles ahead of you . The route seems clear . Did you see Curtis ? Sure did . He 's operating in a big way , still . I want that bastard so bad I can taste it . Don 't worry , Saint John . We 've got him now . Hey , look , it 's better late than never . ( SHOTS FIRING ) Travelling Man to Home Office . I 'm under fire . SAINT JOHN : On my way ! Hang tough . ( SHOTS FIRING ) That should slow ' em down . I 'll contact you in Singapore . Don 't leave your hotel until you hear from me . Here 's your shipping papers . Mike Rivers , able-bodied seaman , merchant marine . Oh , here 's your film . Curtis had no idea that he was on candid camera . Well , just make sure there 's no screw-ups . We 'll get him , Saint John . Him and his entire operation . We 'll see you in Marseille . Marseille . Airwolf to Headquarters . Do you read ? Read you loud and clear , Saint John . What have you got ? Some pretty pictures . I 'll transmit if you 're ready . Go ahead . I 'm ready . Beautiful . Like he was posing for a passport picture . Jason , promise me a shot at him before he 's locked down . Don 't let this become a personal vendetta , Saint John . Curtis turned some close friends into junkies . A lot of guys got killed because they were too stoned to react to enemy fire . It 's nothing but personal ! I understand , but I don 't want your feelings to get in the way of this operation . Don 't worry . Nothing 's gonna get in the way . I 've waited too long to blow it now . We all want him , Saint John . Okay . Airwolf over and out . Brother , there 's a wind blowing today . You never did tell me what ships you 've sailed on before . Nope . Never did . You don 't strike me as a seaman . More like a city kid . Is that right ? I watched you chow down . You couldn 't get a whiff of that gravy without turning green . This is your first trip , ain 't it ? I got a berth on this bucket to get some peace and quiet . Catch my drift ? What were you doing in Singapore ? Strictly rest and relaxation . Maybe I 'll find some up on deck . 'Cause I sure as hell won 't find any here . Well , don 't fall overboard . The captain might like to know about you jumping ship . You know , you could be on this tub all the way to Brazil . Stay out of this , Maxie . You don 't know what you 're getting into . My guess is smuggling . I want a cut , or you 'll get yours ! Oh , come on you 're getting too old for this game . Just go to bed . Give me the bag ! All right . All right . Have it your way . ( GROANS ) I want a share . You can spare a few grand . Split with me , or I 'll get the skipper . Listen . Why don 't you just go down below and tuck yourself in ? I meant to tell you this a lot earlier , Maxie . You talk too much . You ask too many questions . Now , get the hell out of here . ( GRUNTS ) ( GUNSHOT ) Colonel Curtis sends his regards . ( CHUCKLES ) We 've got Saint John 's pictures . How are you feeling , Mike ? MIKE : Thank God for bulletproof underwear . I ran out of sea sick pills my second week at sea , but I think I 'll recover . Excellent work , Mike . Is Jo in position ? MIKE : Ready to go . Corsican just made his drop . Jo should be right behind him . Make sure you keep a tight watch . She 's vulnerable in there . Keep this line open . Will do . Here comes Jo . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) The cars are for the couriers . I used to be one . A mule . GISELLE : Believe me , our job is much easier . Felix . The one I told you about ? Be careful . He has an appetite for beautiful women , and I think you are on the menu . Giselle . I 've been expecting you . This is Helene , my assistant . This is Felix . Enchantee . ( WITH FRENCH ACCENT ) I 've heard a lot about you . I 'm flattered . Don 't be . I was the one who told her . She 's been warned . Pay no attention to Giselle . She has the mistaken impression that I am nothing but a gigolo . The truth is that I am a happily married man . Seven times . I would think you 'd be ecstatic by now . Well , enough about me . We 'll have time to get to know each other later . The chemists have distilled the opium to the morphine base . We are ready for you to test for quality . GISELLE : Felix is quite charming , huh ? ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) Charming , yes . Hypnotic , yes . Like a cobra snake . Let 's finish our business before you fall under his spell . Don 't worry about me . I can take care of myself . I never mix business with pleasure . Never say never . Felix is just like the dope he deals . Once he gets under your skin , he 's hard to shake . Well , I 'd put the purity at about , oh , 92 % . We can start the acetylation , heating and filtering . Hand me the tartaric acid and benzol . Were you a professional chemist ? A long time ago . Things happen . Like Felix ? Yes . Felix . This is how he handles his women . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) I 'd feel a lot better if it was me down in that lab . LOCKE : Jo will be okay . The French police established cover . Saint John and the other mules will be here soon and then she 'll be long gone . Mike , I 've got some good news and some bad news . Give me the good . We 've had a report from Interpol on Curtis . They 've spotted him . And the bad news ? They lost him . He caught a private flight out of Laos and we don 't know where to . So , we 'll have every link in the chain except for Curtis . Saint John 's gonna be furious . Better that he doesn 't know . Right now he 's got his hands full . The chemists are ready . Good . Helene would probably enjoy a holiday . Uh , I 'm sorry . I have plans . Change them . ( MOUTHING ) Come on , Felix . We have work to do . You can make your travel arrangements later . Leave us alone . The couriers have arrived , but Saint John 's late . Oh , wait a second . Here he is . LOCKE : He 's going under the name of Ryan Murphy . The DEA picked up the real Murphy two weeks ago , and he 's been in isolation since . His cover is solid . Gentlemen . Ah , you are the American . Ryan Murphy . Nice to meet you . The Barbarian , Mac The Knife , Pepe . What 's the delay , gentlemen ? I 've got clients lined up around the block waiting for this shipment . It 's being packaged . Felix is amusing himself with the blonde . Women are a priority where he is concerned . Blonde , huh ? Helene . One of the graders . A real knockout . I must confess a weakness for blondes myself . Don 't even look at her when Felix is around or he 'll cut your throat . He doesn 't like competition . ( JO PROTESTING IN FRENCH ) Stop it ! Mind if I cut in ? Get out of here . Wait outside ! I couldn 't help but overhear the lady 's protests . I think she might prefer my company . No , stop . This is stupid . The car is ready to go . You have offended my honor . We will fight . And the winner will have the pleasure of Helene 's company . Corsican rules . Cut him , Felix ! Stick him , Felix ! ( GRUNTING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( EXCLAIMS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( EXCLAIMS ) Come on , Felix . I 've been cut worse than that shaving . ( GRUNTS ) ( INAUDIBLE ) ( EXCLAIMS ) ( GROANS ) I 'd hate to end a beautiful business relationship over the affections of a tart , Felix . Let 's get on with it . Your winnings . You , get in the car . No hard feelings , huh , Felix ? What do you say ? All right . Let 's get this show on the road . I hate to keep the customers waiting . ( SPEAKING IN FRENCH ) Pack up the automobiles . Here we go ! Here comes the couriers . SAINT JOHN : Listen to me , Jo . Watch your tail . JO : Saint John , I 'll be fine . Beautiful . How 's that look , Jason ? Looks good . I 'm transmitting the couriers license plates to Interpol . That 's phase two . LOCKE : Nice work , Jo . What 's the word on Curtis ? An Interpol agent thinks he identified him in London . What 's he doing in London ? Can 't they nail him ? His jet stopped to refuel . He was gone before they had a chance to move in on him . Oh , great . Great . All that work and Curtis gets off as free as a bird . Relax , Mike . We 've got half the police agencies on this planet looking for him . Let 's concentrate on phase three . Saint John should be nearing the border crossing soon . ( GUARDS CHATTERING ) What 's eating you , Mike ? You worried about the New York connection ? Partly . I 'm just wondering what happened to Curtis . He 's obviously got good connections in high places . Yeah . Well , I 'd really like to hang him from one of those high places . Interpol is tightening the net in Frankfurt , Naples , Rome and Paris . They 'll swoop in as soon as Saint John wraps up his end . Which should be in approximately four and a half hours . How 's it look on phase three ? Better than we planned . The DEA just informed me that the three big syndicate chiefs from Chicago , LA and Montreal have just arrived in the Big Apple . The big three ? They don 't usually crawl out from underneath their rocks to personally take delivery , huh ? No . That 's why I 'm thinking maybe Saint John can use some backup going in . You giving him a wire ? A wire and some muscle . I 'm ready if you need me , Jason . No . I 'll go in myself . We 'll nail them all to the wall , and I want to be there . How was the flight ? Not bad . Lousy movie . Breezed through customs , though . We told them you were coming . Let 's get you wired . Looks good . How 's that read , Jo ? Loud and clear . We 've got a 10-mile radius , but we 'll be a lot closer than that . The closer the better . These are the men we 'll be delivering to . What do you mean , " we " ? We , as in we be some bad dudes , bro . I 'll be your backdoor . Jo and Mike will follow with Airwolf . Let 's go . We got some smack to pack , Jack . That 's a fact . Where 'd you get that bad wardrobe , man ? These are my colors , baby . Had these since I was knee-high to a jackrabbit . You ready to rock steady , Freddy ? Ready to move with the groove , dude . Assume the position . ( CHUCKLES ) Your turn , sweetheart . Sorry , fellas . Boss 's rules . No heaters . Well , I hope the boss is in a good mood , 'cause I wanna get paid . With this kind of business , wouldn 't you be in a good mood ? I heard that . I had his kind of money , I 'd be retired in Hawaii . Hey , let me tell you something . With Curtis ' bread , I could own Hawaii . Curtis ? Curtis is here ? What do you think he 's up to ? I don 't know , but we better be ready to move in fast . If Curtis recognizes Saint John we 're ... Wait . Listen . Wait right here . Looks like he 's running a carnival . Good cover for distribution . Yeah . Split if you think Curtis will recognize you . It 's been too many years . I 'm not going to let him slip by me this time . He 's going down , hard . Relax . Take five , kids . We only deliver to the head man . That 's right . No cash , no stash . Yeah , well I gotta check weight before anything happens . So , relax . It 's all there , babe . Forty keys . Yeah . Well , I just like to get a second opinion . You 'd be surprised how many guys try to rip an ounce or two . ( TUTTING ) What 's the scam , man ? Your flunky seems to think we 're a little light-fingered . It 's business , boys . Just like the little lady buying steaks at the butcher . Steaks ? That 's filet mignon , baby . And you better tell your meat packer to keep his thumb off the scales . Well now , who 's the comedian ? My muscle . ( LAUGHING ) Now , I like that . That 's a good one . A mule with muscle ? ( LAUGHING ) You must think you 're moving on up or something . If you were smart , you 'd think about it . Most of your boys look like they 're ready to pick up their pension checks . And wear pantyhose . ( INAUDIBLE ) ( CHUCKLING ) All right . Ten keys each to you , Buccari and Watson . And I 'll keep 10 . Felix tells me that you got a lot of jam . Well , maybe that 's because he 's losing his . Seems to me your whole organization has been too fat , too long . Where do I know you from ? Philly , Detroit , Montreal . I been around the block . Oh , yeah ? That 's funny . I was thinking maybe ... Da Nang , or ... Saigon maybe , or ... Haiphong ? No , it seems I missed that one . I did my duty stateside . Bad eye , you know ? That 's too bad . I could have used a guy with your talent in my unit . We 're open to offers . You get a read on that guy ? Carlton Watson . Distributor from LA . Something big must be going on . He never gets out of his Jacuzzi unless it 's really important . Get ready to fly . We just got word from Europe . Felix is down , Gunther is down . Everybody 's been busted . Somebody on the inside just rolled over . We got a stool pigeon . Damn ! Watson , get the guns out of the locker . Buccari , I want you to take this to Chicago now . You lay low ! Wait a minute , Curtis . You owe us money . We seen this scam before . You make like heat 's coming down , then you split with the goods . Uh-uh . We want our bread now . Leave these wise guys here for bait . Put a couple of bags on them . It 'll slow the cops down . Colonel Curtis ! Sir . You walk out that door , you 're gonna have to face the kind of firepower you never had the guts to in Nam . But you got it coming , don 't you , Curtis ? You served up junk to a bunch of teenage kids and then you sent them in to firefights so high they couldn 't feel the wounds that crippled and killed them . So , you go ahead . You take the point for once . You got the guts . You go ahead and walk out that door . You 're bluffing . Superman . We got you cold , Curtis . Mike , he 's coming out the door . Blow him away . Watson , get the car ready . Come on , move it , Watson ! Aim carefully , Mike . He 's up to his old habits . He 's sending the soldiers out first . You shut up ! I remember you . I remember you , soldier . You . You 're the one that 's gonna go out first . Now , move it ! CURTIS : Tell your friends outside I 'm using you as a shield . They don 't care , Curtis . They 'll cut me down to take you out . Saint John , don 't be a fool . Let ' em go . They 're not worth it . I see your buddy 's got brains . Yours are gonna be all over the wall . Unless you tell them . Now , you tell them ! SAINT JOHN : Mike . We 're coming out . Hold your fire . Back off . Damn it . I want this bastard . Back off , Mike . We 'll get Curtis . BODYGUARD : It 's a chopper ! I 'm going after Curtis . Saint John , careful . Mike ! The dope 's inside . Don 't let them out ! Mike ! Send down the big guns . MIKE : I thought you 'd never ask . Party 's over , fellas . I 'm going after Buccari . Front door ! Buccari has the dope . ( INAUDIBLE ) ( EXCLAIMS ) He 's dead , Saint John . I 'm just making sure . We got them all . It 'll dry up the streets for a while , anyway . Long enough to make it count . We got our evidence . Let him be .

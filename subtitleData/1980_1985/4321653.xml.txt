 You refused a direct order to return to base . You also scrambled half the Soviet Air Force . LYNN : Those guys are dirty , Mike . What are you telling me ? Locke 's a crook ? I don 't know who I can trust . LYNN : You 've got to help us . The man 's a traitor . Airwolfjust went down . ( ENGINES STARTING ) Next stop , Czechoslovakia . You all set ? Coordinates locked in . Let 's make this pick-up clean and simple , huh ? Don 't I always ? What kind of a mother did Mike have ? He said he 'd clean it up tomorrow . Yeah . ( PRINTER CLATTERING ) " Mission canceled . Order Airwolf back to base immediately . " Airwolf , do you read me ? Read you loud and clear , Jo . Priority message from the Company . Newman wants you to bring her back . Party 's over for tonight . Sorry , Jo . You 're breaking up . Please repeat . Well , she said that ... Shh ! Airwolf . ( INAUDIBLE ) LOCKE : Sorry , Jo . Getting nothing here . Must be a malfunction . I 'll check it out . You mind telling me what 's going on ? There 's a guy standing in the woods just outside Marienbad , waiting for us to pick him up . Alan and I go back a long way . I 'm not just going to leave him hanging there . Ah , you know me . I hate to keep anybody waiting . I 'm not getting anything . They 're just gone . Six separate communication systems don 't fail simultaneously . Doesn 't make sense , does it ? What 's the problem , General ? We can 't get your damned helicopter turned around , that 's the problem . Have you contacted the Airwolf base ? Apparently there 's some kind of problem with the helicopter 's communications . Of course , we all know that 's impossible . Well , let 's say it 's highly unlikely . Look , I 've said from the beginning , you cannot run a Company operation like some hamburger franchise . You have to have good people flying that thing . We 've got good people flying it . You 've got major security problems . Not from the Airwolf operation ! ( SIGHS ) Call the Airwolf base . I don 't know . Tell them to keep trying . ( BLEEPING ) We 're flying through Czech airspace . Engaging whisper mode . ( DEVICE BEEPING ) ( BLEEPING ) Picking something up on radar . There 's Alan . Locking in his coordinates now . MIKE : Your buddy 's got some company . Two bodies . They could be hikers . It 's a long way from nowhere . Check them out . Hey , Jason , don 't forget . We 're flying through Soviet-controlled territory , huh ? When you get out there , I can 't give you backup . You 're on your own . Right . ( GUN COCKS ) Well , see you soon ! Got you , buddy . Locke , my friend ! Good to see you . Oh , my God , am I glad to see you . ( INAUDIBLE ) ( GUNSHOT ) ( ALAN GRUNTING ) Come on , buddy , you can make it ! Come on . Go ! Don 't wait ! You 'll be all right . I 'll get you out of here . Come on . We had a deal . Remember ? Angola ? We had a deal . I can 't , man . Do it ! Now ! My God . ( GUNSHOT ) LOCKE : Alan ? Alan ! Jason , get the hell out of there . What the heck 's happening out there ? Hit it . You all right ? Yeah . Just fly . ( BLEEPING ) Heads up . Bandits coming in . Whole nest of them . Let 's get out of here ! Hold your fire . Don 't shoot unless they engage first . This is one hell of a time to worry about rules , Jason . MIKE : Heat-seekers coming at 44 degrees . You want to deflect it or should I call Henry Post on the phone first ? Releasing sunburst . ( BLEEPING ) Entering West German airspace in 45 seconds . We 're home free . Yeah . If we can get past those two MiGs . ( GROANS ) Let 's get the hell home . Whatever you say , boss . God , I love flying . You know , they used to go out on double dates with these two people who owned their own little ... Knock it off . Where the hell have you been ? You two take a holiday ? What happened ? We got set up . That 's what happened . We lost the pickup . Alan was an old friend of his . I 'm sorry , Jason . We didn 't know . Damn ! Access denied . What are you doing ? It 's strictly classified . Access codes ? I said , it 's highly classified . MIKE : Hey ! Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Hold on a minute there , buddy . I mean , I risked my life there , too , to get this information . Hey , look ! If it wasn 't for my flying , those Russian fighters would have made mince meat out of us . And those are the rules you agreed to . You do the flying . I handle security . Come on , damn it ! Doesn 't look as if you 're doing too good of a job . Hey , come on , guys . We 're all in this together . Alan was a computer genius . He must have hidden something in his Company file he wanted me to see . Well , maybe he froze out remote access . Meaning ? Meaning , you 'd have to do it from the Company office . In which case it can wait for tomorrow . Come on , Jason , we 're all tired . Why don 't we just go out for a bite to eat ? No , you guys go . I 'll see what I can do here . Jason ? Look , I just need some space , okay . Hey , so is he being a jerk or is it me , huh ? I 've never seen Jason like this . He 's temperamental . He 's disobeying orders . It 's just not like him . You 've never seen him watch a friend die before . I think he would break all the rules for one of us . So would we . ( INDISTINCT ) Well , there 's more to it than that . You think there 's something else bothering him ? Huh ? You 're going to burn a hole in her back . You 're right . I should be working on her front . Does he have to be so obvious ? Hi . So , I thought maybe you 'd like to buy me a drink ? Why ? Well , then I 'll buy you a drink . Yeah . Well , my name 's Mike . What 's yours ? Ralph . No kidding . That 's my mother 's name . Sorry to hear that . Actually , my name 's Lynn . Well , I 'm sorry to hear that . You see , I 'm actually quite partial to the name Ralph . ( CHUCKLES ) Do you always come on so strong ? Well , do you always set up the guys you really want to meet ? Only the hot ones . Two strikes , no hits . What do you think he 'll do next ? Well , he 'll try for a home run . This place is awfully stuffy . Yeah . You like sports cars ? Well , it depends on who 's driving . I 'm parked around back . Hey , guys , this is good night . I 've gotta go . You understand that . All right , you had a beer and a burger , that comes to ... Sorry , no time for an audit . Bye . ( LAUGHS ) Let 's pay the bill and get out of here . Here . You ain 't going anywhere , Rivers . ( EXCLAIMS ) ( GROANS ) LYNN : Mike , let 's go ! I 'm gonna tag them with a transmitter . Stall for me . Right . ( TIRES SCREECHING ) Watch your hands , buster . I ought to call a cop ! ( ALL CLAMORING ) Get out of my way ! What 's the matter ? Your mother beat you as a kid ? Well , you probably should crawl back , you creep ! Turkey ! Woman-hater ! Don 't you think you 're overdoing it just a little bit ? I 'm not overdoing it ! I 'm ... You wanted a diversion . A diversion , that 's disturbing the peace . Hey , take it easy , will you ? You 'll have to learn to trust me . You 're with the Company , aren 't you ? Damn . Newman in , Jerry ? You just missed him . I left something inside his office . Oh , gee , Mr. Locke . I don 't think I can let you in there . If there 's any complaints , I 'll handle it . Okay , Mr. Locke . ( COMPUTER POWERS ON ) ( TYPING ) Locke , you 'd better have a good explanation . Damn good ! The car was rented at the airport by a Mr. John Smith . Very original . Uh-huh . They 're not in the downtown core . They must have left town in a hurry . After Mike ? Let 's find out . I had to use your terminal . There 's a malfunction in my system . There is no malfunction . Your access is restricted to minimum clearance . On what grounds ? Whose orders ? NEWMAN : Mine , Locke . We suspect a leak in Company security . We 've gotta close it up . By cutting me off the computer ? I can 't work without unrestricted access to Company files . Look , maybe you just better cool off awhile ? What 's going on here , huh ? You refused a direct order to return to base . You also scrambled half the Soviet Air Force . And that makes the military very nervous . We 're gonna reevaluate the entire Airwolf operation . We 're gonna opt for full Company control . ( CHUCKLES ) Hey , that 's brilliant ! You 've got an organization that leaks like a sieve , and now you want Airwolf ! Why don 't you put her in the middle of a shopping center and see who picks her up ? HARDESTY : Maybe the leak is coming from those renegades you 've got flying Airwolf . I don 't have to take that from you , Hardesty . Yes , you do , Locke . Like hell I do . I say we relieve him of his duties , pending reassessment . Then get a team up there and find that damned helicopter . This is still my operation , Hardesty . Just try to remember that . I 'll do that . For the moment . MIKE : It 's a nice car . It 's too bad you don 't have a top for it . LYNN : I do . I just have to find it . You know my friends are gonna wonder what I got up to ? Send them a postcard . Cheers . So what 's going on ? Something tells me this isn 't a charming coincidence . Major Mike Rivers , formerly of the United States Air Force , Special Intelligence Division . Currently assigned to Airwolf . Very impressive . Thanks . You know , most women fall in love at the sight of my dossier . You 're in trouble . I 've been in trouble before . Not this kind . ( PHONE RINGING ) Hello ? It 's for you . What the ... Hello ? You left us holding the tab , buddy . What gives ? How the hell did you get this number ? SAINT JOHN : The transmitter in your wristwatch , standard Company issue , remember ? Actually , we just followed your body heat on infrared . Better cool down , lover boy , you 're way off the scale up here . Ah , it 's okay . I 'm fine now . Those goons in the parking lot must have been muggers or something . Um , can we talk about this later ? Sure you 're all right , pal ? Did you ever hear a heartbeat this high ? ( HEART BEATING RAPIDLY ) Oh , look , I 'll get back to you tomorrow morning , okay . First thing . First thing . Goodbye . ( CHUCKLES ) They worry about me . They should . Pretty clean-cut muggers if you ask me . Good point . Let 's go back for another sweep . Boy , am I glad you picked me up . I have a confession to make . What ? You didn 't pick me up ? I 'm afraid I 'm guilty of mixing business with pleasure . ( EXHALES ) I don 't understand . What are you talking about ? ( CLEARS THROAT ) What 's this ? Take a look . MIKE : These are the two guys that jumped us . What 's Locke doing with them ? LYNN : That 's what we 'd like to know . Those guys are dirty , Mike . What are you telling me ? Locke 's a crook ? You tell me . I know what you 're saying , Lynn , but we 're talking about a friend here . A guy who I trust . Anyway , I 've seen him risk his life for his country at least a half a dozen times . You saw him . He was trying to kill one of our agents . How could you know that ? Having good information is a part of the job . The dead man knew the identity of a mole . A long time double agent , deep in the Company . That 's what he was trying to get out until your friend got to him . There is no way , not Locke . ( SIGHS ) Anyway , I saw what happened . Mike , you saw what Locke and his friends wanted you to see . Look at them ! You saw what he did , and now these guys are gunning for you . ( SCOFFS ) You call that a coincidence , Major ? I don 't know what to think . I 'll see you around . You want to explain this ? You don 't understand , do you ? I don 't have to explain my private life to anybody . You 're telling me you didn 't know she 's a Company agent . She 's a Company agent ? We 're supposed to be a team . I handle security , which means I have to account for your every move . Okay , next time I meet a girl , I 'll bring her home for your approval first . Why 's the Company spying on you ? Ask the man . Maybe just routine surveillance stuff . How 'd you meet her ? Couple of guys mugged me in a parking lot . She helped out . Oh , a couple of guys mugged you . And you didn 't tell me about it ? Jason , it didn 't seem like that big a deal . Jo and I tagged them , and the trail went cold . So you knew about it , too ? What , we 're supposed to tell you every time Mike picks up a chick ? Didn 't seem that important ! Anyway , nobody got hurt . ( SCOFFS ) Nobody got hurt ? What 's wrong with you people ? I 'm right in the middle of the biggest security problem in the history of this Company ! I have to break into a computer to find that my own man is trading love notes with a Company agent ! How are we supposed to know your Company problems ? Jason , if we 'd known , we would have reacted differently . Sorry , it 's classified . So , you can have secrets and we can 't . Is that it ? That 's not what I meant . That 's not what you meant , but what did you mean ? Come on , tell us why you have to break into the Company computer , Jason . Come on , tell us . Tell us why . Temporary access problem . That 's crap ! Come on , Mike , let 's track down that transmitter and find the guys who jumped you . You coming , Mike ? Maybe we can work out that computer problem while they 're gone , huh ? Yeah , sure . And use Santini chopper , will you ? I don 't want anybody flying Airwolf tonight . What the hell is your problem ? Great . It 'll give me a chance to do some flying . Come on . What now , General ? Our friend Locke has been playing computer games . Uh-huh . How 's he doing ? DAVIS : Not bad . He cracked level two this morning . He just now broke level three . Well , that 's just wonderful . What the hell good is all this junk if anybody in the world can run it ? He won 't get past level three . I 've closed it off to all remote users . That ought to make them happy in Washington . I 've already had a call . Airwolf was flying last night . Newman , he is a rogue ! And there 's only one way to handle a rogue . We 'll make one more sweep then head for the other quadrant . I gotta design a transmitter with more range . We have to be right on top of them to pick up anything with a signal . Of course , if we had Airwolf ... You want to talk about it ? ( SIGHS ) What ? About the weather ! What do you think ? You and Locke . Don 't you think he 's acting a bit strange ? You both are . Hey , I didn 't stop us from using Airwolf to find these guys . ( SIGHS ) He 's worried about security . Makes sense to keep Airwolf under wraps for a while . Yeah , sure it makes sense ! Makes our job a lot tougher , too . Look , Mike , if there 's something wrong , why don 't you just talk about it with all of us ? Tell that to Locke . ( BLEEPING ) I got ' em . Due east ! Swing back a little . JO : There it is , in the ditch . I 'm gonna land in the clearing . We can check it out . I don 't like it when it 's this quiet . Something bad usually happens . Oh , Mikey , if it 's too dangerous , you can always wait in the chopper . Come on , I 'll take the car , you look around . Wouldn 't it have been easier just to return the car ? Not for these guys . MIKE : What do you think , Jason ? Familiar ? Carson and Harris . Yeah , I know them . How 'd you get these ? JO : They 're dead . We found their bodies in a ditch east of town . Those were the guys that grabbed me , but then you wouldn 't know anything about that , would you ? That 's right , I wouldn 't . But I think Alan did . If I can get into his file , I think I can get some answers . Well , we can 't do it from here . They 've locked out all remote access . Then I 'll have to get inside and do it myself . If you want the information , why don 't you just go in and get it ? Because I can 't . I don 't know who I can trust . I feel the same way , buddy . Oh , come on , Mike . He 's jerking us around , Jo . All of us . He 's right . I haven 't been straight with you guys . I can 't go inside the Company because they don 't trust me . Hi , there . You wanted to see me ? Yeah . I wanted to see you . Locke 's trying to crack the Company computer . We know that . He 's going to take what he can and run . Then you should stop him . We can 't . Not while he 's got control of Airwolf . And you want me to fix that . I know this is hard for you , Mike , but you 've got to help us . The man 's a traitor . What do you want me to do ? Get me Airwolf . This has gotta be the one . I hope . Ain 't technology grand ! Lynn . Where is it ? She 's in the hangar . Locke won 't know where she is . We 'll keep an eye on her from here . It 's a Company machine , Mike . The Company ought to be guarding it . Yeah , we 've done okay so far . Wait a minute . You 're really good . You really got to me , you know that ? It 's a living . Don 't take it personally . Let 's just get Airwolf and get out of here . You almost had me fooled completely . Almost ? SAINT JOHN : Drop it , Lynn . Don 't move . Anybody ! Give me the gun . Drop the guns ! Take me to Airwolf now ! Do you mind ? A little turbulence could end this special relationship of ours . Then I suggest you fly very carefully . We 're here . There they are . Special Clearance A43 . General Hardesty . Get me General Patterson on the Nimitz . Do it now ! We 've got two fighters coming on pretty fast , Saint John . They 're ours . What do you wanna do ? I 'm thinking . I 'm thinking . PILOT ON RADIO : Orders from General Patterson . Intercept and destroy Airwolf . JO : Don 't they know we 're one of them ? SAINT JOHN : Doesn 't look like it . Looks like your friends are too busy to join us . Can I ask you something ? Where were you going to take Airwolf anyway ? It doesn 't matter now . Yeah , it matters . Matters that you 're a traitor . Principals are for people who see things as black and white . Gray is more my color . In this case , green . Oh , all the loyalty money can buy . What a charming concept . Call them off , Hardesty ! I 've got authorization right from the top on this one . Newman , you 've had it your way long enough . Airwolf is too valuable to lose ! Airwolf is finished . You 'd better start worrying about your own skin . They 're training these guys better now . Glad to hear it . Now what ? We can 't fire back . Get ready to fire a sunburst . I 'm gonna take us down . We 'll be sitting ducks . Better than fried ducks . PILOT ON RADIO : Base , this is Flight 20 . Mission accomplished . Listen , Mike . I have enough money . Come with me . You 're really something , aren 't you ? What choice do you have ? I 've got it ! Names ... Security to Communications , immediately . ... dates , places , everything ! I 've got the mole . Arrest that man . Hold it ! I want General Hardesty confined to the holding cell . No . Nobody move . Nobody . Give it up , Hardesty . You 've lost . Hardesty , call the planes back ! DAVIS : It 's too late . Airwolfjust went down . ( INAUDIBLE ) ( GUNSHOT ) Looks like they fell for the old crash and burn trick . Lucky for us . Let 's go get Mike . JO ON RADIO : Mike ? Mike ? You okay , Mike ? SAINT JOHN : What 's your situation , Mike ? Situation neutralized . I 'm heading home . ( SIGHS ) You sure you 're all right ? Yeah . Yeah . I just didn 't want it to end this way . That 's all . She was bad news , Mike . I know . I know . But there was something that made me wanna believe in her . You know , trust is a funny thing . You saying we should have trusted you ? Well , maybe if I had laid my cards on the table to begin with , none of this would have happened . Yeah , but it did happen . For me , I put my trust in the wrong place . The point is , if we 're gonna function as a team , we 're gonna have to be more open with each other . You 're right . And maybe if the Company figured that out , they wouldn 't have to clean house . MIKE : You 're all right . What say we make a fresh start , huh ? We 'll go out for a couple of drinks , and I 'm buying . What ? ( LAUGHS ) This I gotta see . You 're buying ? ( LAUGHING ) Trust me . LOCKE : Quick , let 's go before he changes his mind . ( INAUDIBLE )

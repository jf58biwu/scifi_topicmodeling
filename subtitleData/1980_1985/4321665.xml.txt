 Airwolf , Hawke . That 's my brother . That 's Saint John . I 'm here to find out about Saint John Hawke . Saint John bought it . Major Rivers . Uncle Dom was like a father to all three of us . I want Airwolf . The Company wants Airwolf back . Your brother will be flying it . Be patient . I have . How 's our parrot ? Singing yet ? Not a damn note , sir . Get him singing , Burke . I want to hear him talk . ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) Guards . I 'll help him . ( SCREAMS ) ( ALL CLAMORING ) I said I 'd help him . BOUCHARD : Soldier . ( MEN CHATTERING ) Still playing the hero , Hawke ? Any movement from the other side ? Negative . Let 's raise the stakes . A wind-drift auto-compensator . Yeah . It 's wired into the RPM governor . Allows for hands-off hovering in really erratic wind conditions . It 's great in air-sea rescue . ( CHUCKLES ) Well , if it works , I 'm impressed . I just hope the world market shares that opinion . Let 's see how she handles some high-speed maneuvers . You know , kid , you 're one hell of a pilot . ( LAUGHS ) Uncle Dom 's one hell of a teacher . Oh , he 's kind of like an old mother hen . Mmm-hmm . How about some coffee ? I 'll join you in a minute , I 'm just gonna get the unit out . I 've put it through the best equalizers and noise-reducers money can buy . That 's as good as it 's gonna get . ( SIGHS ) Let 's hear it again . ( GARBLED RADIO MESSAGE ) That 's my brother . That 's Saint John . I 'll take over from here , Chick . What the hell is this ? It 's called following orders . You 're not going anywhere till I talk to Archangel . All you 're seeing is me . And you 're not gonna see much of that , if I don 't feel some space between us quick . I want some answers , partner . And I want them now . Where is Saint John ? I can 't hear a word you 're saying . Something stinks here . If you didn 't have orders from the Company , why are you seizing that stuff ? All right , fellas , take it easy . He 's my problem . Come with me . Listen , Hawke . Archangel has been stationed somewhere in the Far East . I 've taken over your file . Real nice of him to tell me about it . Okay , spill it . What 's going on ? I really am sorry what happened with your brother . But you know the scene here . They don 't tell me , I don 't tell you . This says here my brother 's still alive . A scribbled note and a tape so scrambled ... This could be my mother . Adds up to squat , and you know it . You know , this isn 't my idea of a good time , either . But according to orders , you 're my pain in the butt and I 'm yours . So you better sit tight . I 'll access our files on Saint John and verify what I 'm saying . In the meantime , be patient . I have . And what was this going to be ? Blowgun ? ( CHUCKLES ) Though I must confess , you keep me highly amused wondering what sort of ingenious toy you 're going to come up with next . All made with you in mind . Airwolf , Hawke . I want to know . Can 't hear you , Bouchard . Look , I 'm tiring of this game . So with or without your help , this will end soon . ( GRUNTING ) ( SAINT JOHN GROANING ) ( PANTING ) Got your message out . You sure of that ? I said so , didn 't I ? One problem though . Your friends need proof that it 's really you . Well , that stuff could 've been sent by anybody , couldn 't it ? Where 's Dom going ? He 's on a short cargo run up the coast . I need to talk to him . ( INAUDIBLE ) WOMAN ON PA : Dr. Davis , telephone , please . Dr. Davis , telephone , please . I want to see the patient in that room . I 'm sorry but nobody 's allowed inside . I 've been listening to that for three days now , and I 'm not listening anymore . Miss Santini ? My name 's Locke . I 'd like to ask you a few questions about your uncle , Dominic Santini , and about Stringfellow Hawke . What do they have to do with you people ? We had a mutual interest in Airwolf . I don 't know what that is and right now , I 'm not in the mood to find out . So if you don 't mind ? WOMAN ON PA : Dr. Bruce , telephone , please . String ? ( MACHINE BEEPING ) It 's me , Jo . I know you can hear me . I 'm going to stay here until you come out of this . You and Uncle Dom were the only family I ever had . I 'm not gonna let you go , too . LOCKE : Rivers ? Major Rivers . Hello , Locke . I thought you were supposed to be on some sort of survival training course ? Where are the others ? Oh , they 'll catch up in two-three hours . I 'd offer you a drink , but I seem to have run out of glasses . I 've got a new assignment for you . Sorry . I 'm all booked . Well , get unbooked . You 've got yourself a new partner . Partner . Orders ? Does it say I can 't finish my drink first ? Cheers . You saved my life . I am indebted . You don 't owe me anything . We just try and survive . My tradition demands it ! They are using you . Something big . ( SCOFFS ) We 're all being used here . As you will . But preparations are being made to get everyone out , except yourself . Something else . I saw Ackroyd give Bouchard something small and gold . ( DOG BARKING ) ( GUARDS CHATTERING ) You mind ? You just blew a perfect deflection shot . You want to try acting like a Major in the US Air Force ? I 've got something to show you . Come here . Airwolf 's capable of Mach speeds , stealth , and whisper modes , infrared and radar jamming . Its surveillance equipment is state of the art , and its weapons are damn near unbeatable . Think you can fly her ? If it moves , I can fly her . It 's somewhere up the West Coast . Probably isolated country . But we got to find her , and fast . Satellite scanning , multispectral and thermal . Possible . But not probable . What do you need ? For starters , complete plans of the ship 's offensive , defensive and communications systems . And that 's just for starters . Good . Well , you can just sign this , and you can get to work . What 's this ? Just sign it . Good . Now , you so much as talk about this file in your sleep , and you 're history . Welcome aboard , partner . I always hated history . JO : You remember the first time Dom took us up in that junky old chopper ? He shoved the stick in your hands , and I screamed . And Saint John and you told me to shut up or bail out . ( CRYING ) String , I can 't do this alone . You 've got to help me . What ? What is it ? ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( SPEAKING INAUDIBLY ) Saint John ... Saint John is alive . Please take Airwolf . Find him , please . Please . ( COMPUTER SPEAKING ) ( GARBLED RADIO MESSAGE ) Blackjack . ( COMPUTER SPEAKING ) ( COMPUTER SPEAKING ) All right . Here we go . ( COMPUTER SPEAKING ) COMPUTER : Birth , May 9 , 1942 . Go back where you came from , man . All you gonna get here is grief . ( GRUNTING ) I 'm here to see Montrose . I 'm here to talk about Storm Season . I see I gotta make my point . Hatch ! Bring him in . Show me your pedigree . I don 't work for the Company anymore . You should know that . I 'm here to find out about Saint John Hawke , Mr. Montrose . He 's dead . When they rolled up Operation Storm Season , I was all that was left . A nine millimeter slug in my spine and not very happy memories . You should know that , too . It 's in the files . Well , unfortunately , most of our files have , shall we say , disappeared . We don 't even rate a file ? That 's gratitude . What happened to Hawke ? Saint John and I were captured by the Khmer Rouge a year ago . The Company financed a rescue mission . It was a total disaster . They hired an independent . A Brit mercenary called Colonel Ray Bouchard , he led the mission . Oh , he got into the prison all right , we got cut to ribbons on the way out . I got this slug . Saint John bought it . LOCKE : You saw him go down ? Bouchard did . He was standing right next to Saint John . They say you don 't make friends in the field . But I did . Saint John was my friend . Blackjack . Does that mean anything to you ? Blackjack ? That was Bouchard 's nickname . Thank you for your time , Mr. Montrose . So you got the ring out , did you ? Told you . No sweat . With Bouchard acting as your runner , I 'm not surprised . What are you talking about , man ? You know damn well , Ackroyd . ( GRUNTING ) ( GUARDS CLAMORING ) I 'd like you to meet my elite corps , Hawke . These fine lads are going to get Airwolf for me . ( CHUCKLING ) LOCKE : Look , I realize this is a bad time for you , Miss Santini , but there 's still a few things I 've got to find out . How close were you to Hawke and Saint John ? We were family . Uncle Dom was like a father to all three of us . He taught us all how to fly . Did he ever talk to you about his work ? I figured there was more to their rent-a-plane business than they let on . Did they ever confide in you ? What is it you want exactly , Mr. Locke ? My friends call me Jason . Whatever you say , Mr. Locke . Do you know what they were doing ? Let me just say that you can be very proud of the work that they 've done for this country . Thanks . Miss Santini , did you know that Hawke still believes that Saint John is alive ? Well , if he does , he never mentioned it to me . I 'll be in touch . Good night , Miss Santini . Good night . LOCKE : No , sir , she appeared to know nothing about the brother . Did she mention Airwolf , Mr. Locke ? No , sir , she didn 't . I have no reason to believe she 's aware of its existence . Make sure . I want Airwolf . The Company wants Airwolf back . I 'm working on that , sir . Anything on Stringfellow Hawke ? He said nothing . I 've put the word out on the street that he 's on special assignment , deep cover . Good . That 's all , Mr. Locke . About Saint John Hawke , sir ... That case is closed . He spent two and a half years MIA before we got him out . Then the fool went into deep undercover work for the agency just like the rest of us . If he is alive , we have to find him . What you do in your spare time is your own business . Good night , Mr. Locke . ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) You see , Hawke , it doesn 't matter anymore whether or not you know where Airwolf is . Your usefulness is almost over . I don 't really care , Bouchard . Ah ! But you will when you see her . Besides , your brother will be flying her . What do you say , Burke ? Should we give this man a program ? ( CHUCKLES ) He 's got a box seat , sir . Please . BOUCHARD : As soon as your brother sees that little scene out there , he 'll dust off the guards with some drum fire . Then he 'll drop in for a running pinpoint pickup . Stage one . The moment the aircraft doors open , poison gas canisters are fired by remote . Convulsion to death . Thirty seconds . Stage two . We attack while the aircraft 's vulnerable on the ground . Destroy her rotors , the aircraft can 't fly . You do see the simplicity of the plan . We repair the rotors , Airwolf 's mine . However , it 's a pity you 've only just ... Don 't kill him ! Not yet . ( CLEARING THROAT ) Major Rivers , before entering my office , would a polite knock be too much to ask for ? I suppose not . I just figured you 'd want to know that I found it . Found what ? Airwolf . The word ? The brother 's gone underground . It 's a special assignment . Well , it looks like you won 't have to spend much more time this way . Your brother has taken the bait , he 's on his way . He won 't fall for it , Bouchard . Oh , you think these scarecrows won 't fool a state-of-the-art machine ? They wouldn 't fool a toaster . Each one is equipped with a heat coil to fool the thermal scan . Even sound loops to produce heartbeats on stethoscopic pick-ups . Perfect , isn 't it ? ( CHUCKLES ) ( GUARDS CHATTERING ) LOCKE : Tell me something , Rivers . How is it no one 's been able to solve this problem but you ? Well , we got a hundred possibilities from multispectral sweeps , but the key was high resolution photographs . And a bit of keen logic . I 'm sorry I asked . See , they 'd been in and out of their lair so often that I figured that their prop wash must have formed a distinct pattern on the landscape . And there it is . Turn right at the next crossroads . Unbelievable . Pull over ! What ? Can 't you hear it ? That your baby , partner ? Damn , someone beat us to it . Wouldn 't I just love to lay my hands on that ship . Come on . All right , come out of there . Who are you ? What are you doing here ? Well , you sure know how to make an entrance . That was you flying that thing ? Yeah . It was me . Who are you ? Miss Santini , what the hell are you doing here ? This machine is top secret . Was top secret , Mr. Locke . Santini ? Dom Santini 's ... Niece . I 'm Jo . I 'm Mike . Mike Rivers . It 's nice to meet you . You 're a great flyer , you know ? Thanks . She 's a great machine . Want to check her out ? Yeah . All right , you two , hold it right there . Miss Santini , I don 't know what the hell you 're up to , but I 'm going to have to order you to leave this area right now . ( SCOFFING ) That 's not how it works . I found her first and I 'm not finished with her . You any good in the air ? Miss Santini , let 's get one thing straight . This machine belongs to ... Look , Jason , I know your people want her back . I just think we can help each other . I want to find Saint John . I know he 's alive . I think so , too . Trouble is , I don 't know where he is . Well , don 't look at me . I do . Look inside . Coordinates ? Well , what are we waiting for ? This baby is incredible . Check out the turbo thrusters . Sunburst decoys , missiles , chain guns . This is a flying army . Now you can see why the Company wants to get its hands back on it . Well , if we 're going to do it ... Let 's do it ! ( ENGINE WHIRRING ) ( ENGINE WHINING ) RIVERS : Coordinates ? JO : Locked and set . MIKE : Going to afterburner . Hold on . We 've got a target on the radar , closing supersonic , sir . That 's a bit fast for a gunship , isn 't it ? Not this one . Get into position . All right ! Let 's move out , you guys ! Quit standing around ! Move ! LOCKE : Objective five miles , four point nine , four point eight . JO : Large force encircling the target . Fixed positions . We 're expected . MIKE : Activating weapons systems . That 's a military machine . JO : That 's him . That 's Saint John . Well , let 's get him . Hold on a second , Mike ! Something 's wrong down there . I can wipe out the guards and scoop up Saint John . LOCKE : Why aren 't they turning around to look at us ? Try running a life scan on the area . Find their back-ups . Seventy-two . Seventy-two ... Every man on that firing squad has identical heart rate ! That 's impossible . MIKE : Keep scanning . Let 's see what else they 've got waiting for us . He must 've smelled the trap . He 'll be back . Place patrols on all the approaches . LOCKE : Scanners are picking up one chopper , no heavy artillery , light ground personnel . JO : What kind of trap is this ? I don 't know , but Saint John is the bait ! Looks like we 've got no choice . MIKE : Okay . Let 's fall for the trap . This is it . They 'll take out the dummies first and drop in . Fire up the chopper , Burke . LOCKE : What the hell 's that ? JO : Poison gas . Ok , let 's give him some cover . Fire at anything that moves ! Burke ! Come in , Burke ! JO : Mike ! Behind us . BOUCHARD : Burke ! Burke ! ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Let 's see what this baby can do . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( GROANING ) Saint John . Is that you ? You bet . ( CRYING ) There 's so much I 've got to tell you . Let it go . I know . Dom ... I know . Don 't let me die . You 're not gonna die . I 'm not gonna let you . I don 't want to die in this place . You won 't , String , I promise you . I promise . ( SOBBING ) Can you hear it this time , Jason ? Music to my ears . There was something I had to do . We 'll all have a lot to do from now on . Locke has an idea . Yeah , I think it 's his way of keeping me off the streets . The fact is , we got the best of everything , right here in this room . I 'd like to continue what we started . But we need you , Saint John , to complete the team . We keep Airwolf our secret , but we work for the Company . What do you say ?

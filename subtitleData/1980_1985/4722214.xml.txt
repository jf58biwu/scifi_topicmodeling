 'The year is 1987 'and NASA launches the last of America 's deep-space probes . 'In a freak mishap , Ranger 3 and its pilot , Captain William " Buck " Rogers , 'are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life-support systems 'and returns Buck Rogers to Earth 500 years later . ' - Bidibidi . Let 's move it , Buck . - I 'm comin ' , I 'm comin ' . Thanks for helping with my shopping . That 's all the equipment I need . Bidibidi . It 's about time . ( Theopolis ) What exactly is a hot tub , Buck ? You get inside , fill it up and you soak . - Oh ... Why ? - Because it 's relaxing . Wouldn 't a sonic shower in zero gravity accomplish much the same thing ? Come back to my place , I 'll show you what it looks like . Then maybe ... - I don 't believe it . - Buck , is something wrong ? Jennifer ? Bidibidi . Uh-oh , a pretty girl and it 's off to the races ! Jenny ! Jenny , it 's me , Buck . Bidibidi ... Buck ! Wait up , Buck . - Jennifer ? - Buck , are you all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine , Theo . I just thought I saw someone I knew . ( Sighs ) I want to go to sleep . ( Man ) Hey , Buck ! Buck , come on , buddy , wake up . Shake a leg , Rip Van Winkle . Your lady 's gonna be here any minute . - What time is it , Toby ? - Nearly seven . - I gotta get a move on . - We report at 0400 hours , buddy . So make the most of the evening . I intend to . I 'm taking Jennifer to dinner at Raphael 's . - Raphael 's ? Fancy ! - Nothing but the best for her . Yeah ? So how 'd she get stuck with you ? ( Knocking at door ) - Get the door on your way out , Toby . - Oh , OK , I 'm going . I 'm gone . We 've got to quit meeting like this . I think he 's the jealous type . - Good night , Toby . - Good night , Buck . - Hello . - Hi . - You 're an amazing woman . - Why 's that ? Every time I see you , I think you couldn 't get more beautiful . And you do . - Oh , Buck , I 'm gonna miss you so much . - I 'm gonna miss you , too . - I brought you something . - A going-away present ? Well , sort of a going-away present . And a come-back-home-to-me-soon present . Let me see what 's inside . Oh , wow ! - It 's beautiful . - Do you like it ? I thought you could take it with you on your ship . I will . Thank you . - I love you . - I love you too . Jennifer , I promise , after this mission I 'm finished . I promise you I 'll never leave you again . Never again . ( Echoing ) Never again , never again , never again , again , again , again ... ( Wilma ) Fancy flying , Buck . I 'm sure those cadets learned a great deal . ( Buck ) It was nothing special . Buck , are you all right ? You 've seemed upset all day . - I 'm fine . - Of course . - You wanna talk about it ? - No . Wilma , I appreciate your concern , but I don 't want to talk about it . Not now , anyway . This is Deering . Good work , cadets . Return to Directorate flight hangar . Captain Rogers and I are returning to New Chicago via Central Spaceport . Deering out . ( PA ) ' Flight 723 now arriving at gate 14 . 'Orbital shuttle 409 for City-On-The-Sea now boarding at gate 23 . ' I have some business at the Spaceport Control . I won 't be long . - I 'll wait in the lounge until you finish . - OK . Again ? Excuse me . Excuse me . Pardon me . Excuse me . Miss ! Miss ! Please , wait ! I 'm sorry , sir . Flight 409 has just completed boarding . - But there 's a woman on it I gotta see . - Another flight will depart in 20 minutes . - But she 's on that flight . I have to see her . - I am sorry , sir . You are too late . 'Captain Christopher Pike , please report to the Veterans Affairs Office . ' Reservations desk . They 'd at least have her name . Miss , I need help . I 'm looking for someone who just boarded flight 409 . Without the proper authorisation , I can 't release our passenger manifest . Look , this is important . I 've got to find her . I 'm sorry . Problem ? Yes , I 'm looking for someone who boarded flight 409 . I have to find her . - Aren 't you Captain Rogers ? - Yes , I am . Pleased to meet you , Captain . Give Captain Rogers any information he needs . - Yes , sir . - Thank you . Erm , she 's about 28 . Er , blonde hair , wearing a pink outfit with black boots . Is this her ? - Yeah , that 's her . - Leila Markeson . No address listed . She 's booked on orbital shuttle 409 , bound for City-On-The-Sea . - City-On-The-Sea ? - An urban complex . Located on the tip of what used to be called the Mississippi Delta . Oh , New Orleans ? She may have gone to the Festival of Masks . - Hundreds of people leave every hour . - Festival ? Oh , well , why not ? I 've never been to a 25th-century Mardi Gras before . Thank you . Nope . No address for Leila Markeson in City-On-The-Sea . She must just be a visitor . - That makes things harder , but I 'll find her . - Buck , listen . Even if you do find her , what then ? Jennifer meant a lot to me . If there 's only a one-in-a-million chance , I 've got to take it . You understand ? Oh , I suppose ... For a year after my wife died , I had dreams . Nightmares , actually . I 'd wake and expect to see her face . And then I 'd remember that she was gone . I suppose , were I in your shoes , I 'd do exactly the same thing . - Good luck . - Thanks , Doc . Buck , your shuttle 's ready for takeoff . - Thank you , Wilma . - Bidibidi . Goodbye , Buck . See you , old buddy . Buck , I ... I hope you find what you 're looking for . You deserve it . Thanks , Wilma . Progress report from Vega system , Commander . - Capsulise . - The Vega colony is within our grasp . We estimate their weaponry and supplies will be depleted within five solar days . Unless the Earth Defense Directorate succeeds in their mission of mercy . You would know better than I the possibilities of that situation . Also , the Terran woman just arrived from New Chicago . Send her in . Commander Reev will see you now . Reev ? Everything went as planned . Buck Rogers should be on his way to City-On-The-Sea . This is Captain Buck Rogers . Request permission to dock at Central Spaceport . 'Captain Rogers , you are cleared for docking . 'Please decelerate to Mach One and prepare for approach . ' Roger . Now , about my credit voucher . Of course . The first half of your payment has already been deposited , as you know . The second half shall be transferred upon delivery of Rogers to us . With his help , we 'll easily destroy the freighter the Terrans are sending to Vega . And as an added gratuity , you may keep that face if you like . No , thank you . I prefer my own face . I 'll be ready for molecular surgery after I complete this job . As you wish . Now , then . Allowing for a half-hour journey from New Chicago 15 minutes to disembark , 10 minutes to register for lodgings , I 'd say that Rogers will begin his search for his " lost love " at precisely 1500 hours . Let him search for an hour or two , long enough for him to become tired , discouraged . He 'll be at his most vulnerable then . That is the moment you must appear . - You think of everything , don 't you , Reev ? - I can 't afford not to . Well , you 'll have your man , and I 'd better have my money . Despite her behaviour , your Leila is weak and soft . That could prove a danger . I have already taken that into account , Nola . There are ways to make that softness work to our advantage . The Koven are a warrior race in the Kadar system . We have recently learned of their plans to move against Vega V. Since Vega V is an independent colony , we cannot send in fighter squadrons to fight the Koven . We can send them emergency equipment , supplies and weapons . You five and Colonel Deering will transport those supplies in an M-class starfreighter we 've secured for this mission . - Colonel Deering ? - Lieutenant Rekoff ? M-class freighters were abandoned years ago . Why use such an old model ? This is a clandestine operation , Lieutenant . We 've tried to keep every detail secret from the Koven . Don 't worry , we 've replaced the freighter 's old engines with a new tachyon drive capable of tremendous speeds . Thank you , Colonel . The ship is in Earth orbit . Colonel Deering and you will constitute the bridge crew . All other functions on the ship will be handled by maintenance androids . The survival of Vega V rests with you and the supplies you 'll be carrying . - Good luck . - Dismissed . ( ♫ Lively carnival music ) Masks ! Robes ! Enchantments ! Festival tonight ! No festivities without a mask , a robe , a pair of gloves ! Ah , you ! What is your fantasy ? What kind of woman hides inside you ? Is it an angel ? A peasant ? A queen ? Well , take a mask and live your dream ! What about you , sir ? A mask ? A robe ? No , no , an enchantment . - No , thank you . I 'm not here for the festival . - No ? Then why are you here ? I 'm looking for someone that meant a lot to me . Meant ? But that 's in the past . Yesterday is gone . We have to live for today . You may be right . What are you , anyway ? A pedlar or a psychologist ? Ha , ha , ha ! Neither , actually . You see ... Forgive me . They call me Silby . - At your service . - Buck Rogers . Pleased to meet you , Buck . No , I just do this to make a living . But in real life , I 'm a magician . That 's funny . I didn 't think magic existed any more . But of course it does ! And will , for as long as we believe in the impossible . Sometimes that 's very difficult to do . It takes extraordinary people nowadays . Watch closely . Don 't move ! Watch this ! Nothing here , there , but in the twinkling of an eye ... - A bowl of fruit . - ( Cheering and applause ) Not even close . Well , a mistake , a mistake . Never mind , sir . Now , watch closely , watch closely . Nothing in my robes , nothing in my hands . But in the merest flash of a second , you will see ... an Antarean nightbird ! Miss ! Leila ? Leila Markeson ? Yes ? Can I help you ? You were in the spaceport in New Chicago . - Even the voice is the same . - Excuse me ? Sorry . My name is Buck Rogers , and despite appearances , I 'm not crazy . I didn 't think you were crazy . Just a little strange , maybe . You remind me of someone I knew a long time ago . Did you come here just to tell me that ? No , no , of course not . It 's just that this person meant an awful lot to me . And when I saw you at a distance ... Can we go someplace and talk ? Maybe I can help clear this up . All right . I think there 's a little café nearby . OK . Alpha Team , get the field generator to shuttle 12 and stow it in hull section C. - And hurry , we only have nine hours . - Bidibidi . Hiya , good-looking ! How 's it coming along , Colonel ? Fine . We should have the shuttle loaded by 1300 hours . Then one hour to the freighter . Two more hours to get everything transferred for the trip to Vega V. - Looks like we 'll depart on schedule . - Good . There are no indications that Koven is aware of this operation . Let 's hope it stays that way . Any word from Vega ? No . Our last communication with the colony was two hours ago . I 'm afraid Koven is jamming all subspace transmissions . - Then we 'll have to step up the operation . - Exactly my idea , Colonel . Bidibidi . See you later , Wilma . Your Jennifer sounds like she was a very lovely woman . And very lucky . I was the lucky one . Oh , no , so was she . To have someone like you to love her as much as you obviously did . I 'm sorry . I keep staring . Can 't seem to stop it . I don 't mind . I like the way you look at me . Very much . I just wish you were really looking at me and not Jennifer . Leila , I know you 're not Jennifer . Physically , you do look like her , but there 's something different about you . I don 't know if it 's your smile , your eyes or ... Just something . Look , Buck , I have to ... I 'd just like to get to know that part of you . I 'd like that too , very much , but you don 't know what you 're getting into . - And what 's that ? - I 'm not the person you think I am at all . - You don 't know anything about me . - I know . I 'd like to get to know you . No , you don 't know what you 're talking about . Look , just go home , forget about me . Please , go home . - Leila , I don 't understand . - Leave . I don 't want them to hurt you . - Them ? - Just go . Hello , Captain Rogers . Good work , Leila . Captain Rogers , you will come quietly with us and nobody will get hurt . Come on . After them , and find Reev . As soon as you take the shuttle back to Earth , we 'll be able to leave orbit . We 'll track you to stargate . After that , we 'll have to maintain subspace silence . I understand . We will reach the Vegan systems 6.3 hours after we leave stargate . Excellent . I won 't keep you . Good luck . Convey my thanks to your crew . Dr Huer ... Have you heard from Buck ? No . I imagine he 's still in City-On-The-Sea , chasing his dream . - Do you think he 'll really find it ? - I hope so . It would be nice to think one could recapture one 's lost dreams , wouldn 't it ? In here . - Now ... - Look , don 't start in on me , Buck . I didn 't know anything about you and I didn 't care . How could you do something like this ? For money . I was poor and I was sick of being poor . I was all alone and I was scared . My precious ethics were getting me nowhere . For the first time in my life , I wanted to think of myself first . There was no way I could have known it was going to be the wrong time . - What 's your connection with these aliens ? - They hired me . I was supposed to help them capture you . I don 't know why . They didn 't tell me details . I think they want you to destroy something . A starfreighter , I think . How , er ... How did they find out about Jennifer ? They got into your apartment . They saw her photograph and they set about creating a new Jennifer . Creating ? - I don 't believe it . - Molecular surgery . It 's fast , it 's very efficient and it 's reversible . Oh , Buck , I had to do it ! I didn 't know any of this was going to happen . How could I have known how you 'd feel ? Or how I 'd feel ? It 's all right . Leila ... everything up to now is in the past . Let 's forget it . It 's not too late . Now , you wait right here . I 'm gonna contact New Chicago . They 'll have a shuttle here for us in an hour . No , Buck , don 't ! That 's exactly what they expect you to do . They 've anticipated every move you can make and they 've got traps set . I wouldn 't try anything , Captain Rogers . Something might happen to your friend . - How did you find us ? - She told us . During her surgery , we had a transponder inserted beneath her skin . We 've known exactly where she 's been ever since she decided to renege on our agreement . Stargate in 20 seconds , Colonel . Excellent . Punch in our destination , Lieutenant . Coordinates on the board , entering stargate . Vega V now 6.3 hours away , Colonel . Very good , Lieutenant . Maintain subspace silence from this point on . Respond to no one and to no signal . I 'll be in the cargo hold if you need me . You have comm . Captain Rogers , let 's be reasonable . The conflict on Vega V is a minor one , a petty squabble that will die if left alone , but if the Federation freighter reaches the colony with those weapons , this could escalate into something monstrous . - The Federation knows what it 's doing . - Apparently not . Their intelligence network was infiltrated by nationalists in the colony . The Federation is responding to totally inaccurate information . Why didn 't you go to the Federation ? Unfortunately , the Federation is suspicious of anything we do . Most probably due to the same intelligence contamination . - As a result , we need you . - To do what ? Our ships cannot intercept that freighter without inviting a war with the Federation . We do not wish that . But you could intercept and destroy the freighter before it reaches the colony . - Why should I do anything for you , Reev ? - Two reasons . One - you would be doing a great service for the Federation , and for all the innocent people on Vega V. Secondly , if you do not help us and them , you and Leila Markeson will die . That 's not true . He 's planning to put me in cellular suspension . It 's been his plan all along . The plan we told you about , Leila . Not the exact plan . Captain Rogers , I am serious about this . I am willing to do whatever 's necessary to help those people . Use your head . There is nothing on that freighter but androids . You would be harming no one , and saving countless lives . - I can 't do it . Not for you , not for anyone . - Then for Leila ? - ( Leila ) Buck ? - OK , Reev , I 'll do it . - I don 't like it , but I 'll do it . - Thank you , Captain Rogers . I can assure you this is the right decision . Nola will be accompanying you . We 'll be monitoring that sector with our long-range sensors , and we will know if the freighter is or is not destroyed . You have 12 hours to do so and return here to Earth , before Leila is put to death . Fortunate for us you care for the Terran woman . Although I can hardly see why . She 's so weak , soft . You deserve someone much smarter , stronger . I 'm sure you have someone in mind . - Perhaps . - Thanks for the thought , but I 'm not your type . ( Engines rev ) Stargate coming up in 20 minutes . Rendezvous with that freighter five minutes after . How do you plan on slipping past their defence shields ? - Oh , I thought I 'd just wing it . - What ? - Trust me . - Not on your life . - Bidibidi . Hiya , Dr Huer . - Hello , Twiki . I don 't believe I ordered any dinner . Twiki thought you might need nourishment . Bidibidi . Try it . You 'll like it . - What 's the latest on Vega V , Doctor ? - Not good , I 'm afraid . Koven warships have breached the colony 's outer defence perimeter . They should be within striking range in 10 hours . At least it gives a four-hour margin of safety to Colonel Deering . You 'll be monitoring the subspace channels ? Of course . OK , Doc , eat your soup . - What are you doing ? - Look out the starboard viewport . I 'm sending a Code Blue distress signal . Directorate ships are obliged to respond . With luck , the androids will tractor-beam us into their hangar bay . And if they don 't ? If they don 't , I can try and punch a hole in their force shield , and we go in anyway . Do not try anything foolish , Captain Rogers , like sabotaging your attack . If we do not get home , Leila Markeson dies . Don 't worry . Slamming my ship into a force shield is not my idea of a good plan . I 'm receiving a Code Blue distress signal from a shuttle 2,000 kilometres astern . Our orders are to proceed directly to Vega V. I understand , Colonel , but this is a Code Blue signal . Yes , the shuttle wouldn 't be issuing it unless they were in serious trouble . Can you raise the shuttle on subspace ? Negative . They 're not receiving . Their PC units could be down . Tractor beam . Send two androids to the cargo hold . Keep them there until we find out what the trouble is . Yes , Colonel . Here we go . Halt ! Please remain in the cargo area until identification can be verified . Certainly . We have our identification right here . - You know where the engine room is ? - I 've got an idea . We 're bound to run into resistance . Don 't you think I ought to have a gun ? I don 't think that 's a wise idea , Captain Rogers . - Why ? I told you I 'd help destroy this thing . - Which is what you 'll do . Proceed ! - Buck ! - Wilma ! What are you doing here ? Enough talking . Drop the gun . - What 's going on ? - Just do it . We don 't have time to talk . You 're with ... her ? Just drop the gun , Wilma . Then get out of the way . I 'll do that . Wilma , what are you doing here ? We were escorting the freighter , to help the colonists fight the Koven . What are you doing with a Koven warrior ? - The woman I was following ? - Leila . Yeah . Koven used her to get me to agree to try to blow up this freighter . - Nola and I were here for that reason . - You wouldn 't do that . No , of course not , but they 've got Leila and they 're gonna kill her unless I can make them think I 've blown it up . - What did you have in mind ? - They 're scanning this quadrant . - To monitor the explosions . - Exactly . But it 's impossible for them to distinguish between freighter and asteroid explosions . - You 're probably right . - You got any bombs on board ? We have a warhead we were delivering to the colonists . That 's in Hangar B. Perfect . Let 's get on down there . We 've only nine hours before they deal with Leila . - How are you coming with that warhead ? - It 's in launch position now . - We 'll eject as soon as you 're out of range . - Good . Put that freighter into overdrive . Koven aren 't aware of the new engines . The explosion will cover your escape . By the time their sensors clear , we 'll be far enough away that they won 't recognise us . - Good luck , Buck . - Thank you , Wilma . Good luck to you . See you back on Earth . Rogers out . Captain Rogers has just entered the stargate . If everything goes as planned , the freighter should explode within 23 seconds . Exactly on schedule . Captain Rogers will be returning here within 30 minutes . - And then what will you do ? - Absolutely nothing . Rogers would never admit he sabotaged a Directorate mission . And as for you , well , I think your payment will ensure your continuing loyalty . If Buck will have me , then I 'm going with him . - I 'm afraid I can 't allow that to happen . - Well , you can 't stop me from leaving . Oh , I won 't have to stop you . You 'll gladly stay . - Why ? - You have forgotten your transponder . It cannot be removed . If you were to leave with Buck Rogers , I would find you , and kill you both . Don 't try it ! The explosion in space , it was a counterfeit ? - That 's very astute . - I anticipated as much . There was a 33 % chance you would not go through with the plan . - I was counting on Nola to even those odds . - Nola 's in a brig on her way to Vega V. Sorry to disappoint you . Leila , come on , let 's get out of here . - I can 't go with you , Buck . - What ? It 's too late . Too much has happened , and I don 't think we could change that . And I 'm just an image of somebody you lost a long , long time ago . Leila , I know you 're not Jennifer . No , please , just go . I 've already done too much and I don 't think I can ever turn back . Just go . Forget about me . Any disturbance in the immediate area triggers off an alarm , as you can see . - Reev , you told me he could live . - Under different circumstances , not now . - No ! - Leila ? ( Gasps ) Aargh ! Leila ? - I 'm sorry . - Shhh . I 'm so sorry I disappointed you . You didn 't disappoint me . All I ever wanted to do was just to be like your Jennifer . Do you think maybe I was like her just a little bit ? Yes , yes . Then I guess I didn 't do everything wrong , did I ? Buck ? Dr Huer , Buck 's just returned from the Antares system . Excellent . Do you suppose these weeks of rest have done him any good ? I don 't know . The last time I talked to him , from City-On-The-Sea , he sounded numb . Yes . Well , I know the feeling . - ( Beep ) - Ah , that must be him . - Welcome home , Buck . - Thank you , Doc . - Good to have you home . - Thank you , Wilma . I wouldn 't live through the last three weeks for the universe , but it gave me time to think . I learned something . I can 't go back . It 's impossible to try to relive the past . All I can do is make the best of what I 've got . Bidibidi . Welcome home , Buck . - Thanks , Twiki . - Speaking of homecomings ... We have a gift to celebrate yours . Dr Junius found it in the archives . An entertainment clip from the 20th century . I believe you called them " movies " ? Oh ... Thank you , Doc . - It 's a nature documentary of some kind . - A nature documentary ? Yes , aquatic life forms , although the title indicates anatomy . I think it 's called Mouth or Mandibles , or something like that . - Jaws ? - Yes , Jaws ! That 's it , exactly . Bidibidi . Just when you thought it was safe in the 25th century ... ( Laughing )

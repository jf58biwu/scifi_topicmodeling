It is sometimes said that where there is no hope , there is no life . Case in point , the residents of Sunnyvale Rest Home , where hope is just a memory . But hope just checked into Sunnyvale , disguised as an elderly optimist who carries his magic in a shiny tin can . Vitamin A is for the scalp , the hair , vision , and teeth . Vitamin B is for the hair and mucous membrane . Vitamin C is for the circulatory system . Very important for that part . And let 's not forget calcium for good strong bones and teeth . Before we get to that , though , I always recommend a little lemon juice in the diet . Good diet , healthy senior citizen . Now to E. This is an important one . If you 've enjoyed healthy sex throughout your life , there 's no reason why you can 't continue to enjoy , well into your 80s . Now , I have some special exercises for you . That 's Leo Conroy .

Every second Saturday , he carries those cases down to his kid 's car , and every second Saturday he carries them back upstairs again and unpacks . The answer is . : It 's been nicknamed " Scourge of the Sons of Han " because of its perennial flooding . Don 't say it , Agee . I 'm thinking . What is the yellow River ? Those damn kids ! They 've been told not to play around here . old people need their rest . well , they 're just playing , Mr. Conroy . No harm done . I wish I couId go out there and play with them . - Why don 't you , Mrs. Dempsey ? - Because , Mr. bloom , she is old . You 're never too old to play , Mr. Conroy . You see , when I rest , I rust . Is this your first time in an old age home , bloom ? No , actually , Mr. Conroy , I 've been in six or eight of them . tell me , Mrs. Dempsey , if you could go out there and play with those children tonight , what would you want to play ? well , I used to love all kinds of games , especially jacks . I used to be elementary school jacks champion . Don 't say it , Agee ! I 'm thinking . But if I couId tell my body now what to do , I would dance . Who is BarthoIomew Cubbins ? - Who is Bartholomew Cubbins ? - Good for you . Bartholomew Cubbins ! I would be honored if you would dance with me , Mrs. Dempsey . I would love ... Oh , my back ! paul , this is Amadeus . Remember how to use him ? What I wouldn 't give just to be hitting puberty again . Oh , go on . Remember this , Mrs. Dempsey ? " Not last night , but the night before " 24 robbers came knocking at my door " As I ran out , they ran in - " And this is what they said to me ... " - Stop ! You had a full life , sweetheart . Don 't go sloppy on me now . And put on the shoes , huh ? A good Jew only goes barefoot when someone has died . I 'm not that kind of Jew . well , I am . Put them on . Mr. Weinstein , what were you Iike as a boy ? Oh , I Ioved to climb anything . Like a cat , I couId climb . - I always wanted to be douglas Fairbanks . - Oh , you still do , Mr. Agee .

What about you , Mr. bloom ? - What did you play ? - My game was kick the can . Oh , that was a boys ' game . My late husband , Jack Dempsey ... - Not the fighter ? - Oh , not the fighter , not the fighter . Jack Dempsey was the most gentle man who ever walked on the earth . Jack Dempsey loved that game . He absolutely loved ... What is the point of all this talk ? Why are you dredging all this up ? It isn 't healthy ! " Birdie with the yellow bill , hopped upon my window sill " Cocked his shiny eye and said , 'Ain 't you shamed , you sleepyhead ? " ' marbles ! Now there was a game . Life was so simple and gentle when I was a little girl . - people took care of me . - They take care of you here . Miss Cox takes great care of you . Doesn 't let you do a thing . No . But I had lots of friends and toys . - Toys ? You want toys ? - Toys . Why , they have toys here to last you the rest of your life . - And friends ? - Oh , yes , friends . Why , Mr. bloom here is trying to make friends . Trying to stir them all up , aren 't you , bloom ? The day we stop playing is the day we start getting old , start watching the clock , waiting for the days to hurry up and end , counting the years . We always have something to look forward to . Another dawn , another day , another summer , another game of kick the can ! Kick the can ! - So who 's playing ? - What ? I 'm starting up a game of kick the can ! Who 's playing ? bloom , when was the Iast time you fell down and couldn 't get up by yourself ? How dare you ask them to go out there and risk the little bit of Iife they have left in them ? Life is risk , Mr. Conroy . I 'm not asking anybody to do anything that I 'm not willing to do . well , I agree with that . Maybe if we played kick the can , we 'd get a little hold of that magic we all been missing . A little hold on youth . Look , their bones are old and will break if they try to run . Their hearts are old . Their lungs are old ! Miss Cox would never allow us to go out there and play , Mr. bloom . - It 's against the rules . - rules ? - Did rules ever stop a child ? - No . You gonna let rules stop you from the chance of being young again ? Oh , no , no , no . I don 't think so . You see , this old man still has a little magic left in him . And if you believe , I can promise to make you all feel like children again . You 're making promises they can 't keep ! - Mrs . Dempsey , I want to see you dance . - Oh , I would love that . And I want to see you climb , Mr. Weinstein . Like a ketsele I 'II climb ! We 'II break the rules . What can they take away from us we haven 't already lost ? When were you thinking of playing , Mr. bloom ? Tonight , tonight , tonight ! Don 't bother to wake me up ! It 's time . It 's time . It smells like midnight , as I recall . One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten . I see you , Agee ! TaIIyho ! TaIIyho ! Mr. bloom is ... Oh , see , Mr. bloom ? paul kicked the can .

I was too young to see HaIIey 's Comet . I was going to see it when I was 80 years old . That 's only two birthdays away , Mrs. Dempsey . would you Iike to see it at eight or 80 ? Eighty . Thank you . well , you can always go inside and go back to bed .

Yes . always ? always . Okay . Anthony , let 's not do too much more of that , okay ? - Sure . - Okay . AII right . Look in your pocket . Never mind . What you 're looking at could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare . It isn 't. lt 's the beginning . Introducing Mr. John Valentine , air traveler . His destination , the Twilight Zone . Ladies and gentlemen , this storm has developed a little faster than we had anticipated . We 're maneuvering about , finding the smoothest spots with radar . There 's still a chance that we might hit some uh-ohs and whoopsy-daisies , so I 'm asking you to return to your seats and fasten your seat belts . Please extinguish your cigarettes or anything that might fly about in the aircraft , look out the window and enjoy ... hello in there . Can you hear me ? hello . Oh , hi . It 's a passenger that 's been in there for a Iong time . - tail ? Fair-haired ? - Yeah . Yeah . Seat 4A . Oh , yeah , valentine . I had a feeling about him . White-knuckIe type . How are we gonna get him out of the bathroom ? - Is there something wrong ? - No , no , no . Everything 's fine . Mr. valentine ? May I help you ? Just a moment . Dionne , why don 't you knock ? Something could be wrong . Let 's give him a few more minutes . Are you okay ? No problem . Look , Mr. valentine , I know how you feel . Lots of people are nervous about flying . But if you look at statistics , you 're safer up here than on the ground . That 's right . Safer than your own bathroom . No , I 'II be perfectly fine . Oh , dear ! Everything 's gonna be fine . We 're gonna help you back to your seat . actually , the chances of drowning in the bathroom , the bathtub , is something like 8 / 100,000 of a percent , whereas air crash fatalities from last year 's figures , the number of passengers who traveled by air last year , is equal to the population of the whole country . That 's ... That 's 426,504,000 ... I forget the rest . The people who died at home , they outnumber the people much more than ... Whereas driving ... Driving , forget it . The percentage of people who die driving , 22 , 23 % of ... - Do I need my boarding pass ? - No , you don 't . Watch your head . Watch your head . That a boy . I think I spilled my drink . I think I spilled my drink . Oh , I 'm sorry , sir . Here , Iet me fix you up . Let me put things away here . Micro Chip Logic , The Liberation of the Left Brain . - Science fiction fan , huh ? - No , that 's a textbook . Computers . - Do you really read this stuff ? - I wrote it . Oh , my goodness , so you did . I 'II tell you what , we 'II put this away , and you try to get some sleep . No , no , no ... I 'd Iike you to leave the light on . Okay . I 'II take this . Okay ? Come on . tell you what . I 'II put this in a safe place . Look , you 're gonna be fine , so cheer up , okay ? Get some water . Let 's get this seat belt fastened . - What ? Is something wrong ? - No , no , everything 's fine . Look , we 're not supposed to do this , but I have these sedatives . - They might help you sleep . - No , it 's ... It 's all right . I don 't need anything . I 'II be fine . - They 're very mild . - No . Thank you , but I 'II be all right . - This will cost you four bucks . - What did you say ? - only kidding . - well , I 'm not kidding . We 've got to get you back to your seat now . - I want to stay here ! - Oh , no , no , no . We 've got to get you back here . Here we go . Now let 's fasten your seat belt . - I don 't need my seat belt fastened . - Oh , yes , you do . We wouldn 't want you to fall out . - I 'm not gonna fall out . - Not if you sit here , you won 't . - Okay ? - Okay . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . - Sure ? - Yes , I 'm sure . Look , I 'm Dionne . Anything you need , call me . well , thank you , but I 'm sure I 'II be fine . really , I 'II be fine . Okay . You heard the Captain . No smoking . N-O S-M-O-K-I-N-G . No smoking ! There 's something out there ! There 's something moving , I saw it ! There 's a man on the wing of this plane ! There was somebody out there . - You 've got to believe me ! - I saw him . Green and slimy . - Leave the poor man alone . - I 'm only trying to help . - You 've got to humor them . - There was lightning . At first I thought it was an animal , some kind of a bird or something , but it was a man ! There were flames coming out of the engine , and then a flash and then smoke ! Maybe it was a technician who was caught on the plane when it took off . My God , how could he survive out there ? The air is too thin . The blast of the wind . It 's ... It 's so cold . It 's impossible , isn 't it ? My God . I feel so stupid . Can you imagine ? A naked man crawling along the wing of an airplane at 35,000 feet ? There 's no reason to feel embarrassed , Mr. valentine . - Just try to get some sleep . - It 's amazing , the mind , how the eyes can make you see something that isn 't even there . There 's a man in seat 3F that 's completely freaking out . Look , you 're just gonna have to deal with him . It 's all right . You don 't have to stay with me . I know you have other passengers to attend to . I 'm happy to sit with you till you sleep . No , it 's probably easier for me if I 'm alone . - Are you sure ? - I 'm sure . I 'm drowsy already . - You see ? - Okay . Get the handcuffs . I 'm all right ! I 'm all right ! I 'm all right ! Don 't touch me ! Don 't touch me ! FAA security . You want me to take care of this ? No . It 's all right . He 'II be all right . You 've got to land the plane ! There 's a man outside . - Just take your seat . - You 've got to let me outside . could everybody sit down ? Sit down ! Get in your seats . I want all the passengers in their seats . Yes , thank you very much . Get this thing on the ground ! You gotta get this thing onto the ground ! - You gotta get this on the ground ! - Do you know where you are ? - Mr . valentine ! - Get us on the ground ! - Take care of the little girl . - Okay . Come here , darling . - Handcuffs ! Far out ! - That 's it . relax . Come on , honey , you belong over here . - Mommy ! - That a girl , that 's it . Mommy , a strange man , he 's got me ! My God , what has she done this time ? Take deep breaths , Mr. valentine . Deep , long breaths . slow . relax . That 's it . We 're safe . We 're gonna have a little talk . What seems to be the problem ? will you look out that window , please ? What was I supposed to see out there ? Nothing . Nothing at all . I 'm sorry I shouted . Mr. valentine , you 've got to see this my way . I 'm the First Officer of an airplane in a severe storm . Now , I have an irrational passenger . You 're threatening the safety of this aircraft and you 're frightening the other passengers . You either calm down or we 're gonna handcuff you . Listen , there 's something wrong with this airplane ! I don 't care what happens to me , but if somebody doesn 't do something about it , we 're all gonna die ! - That 's D-I-E , die ! - You big silly ! You used to be a normal person ! Sit down , darling . Come on , okay ? Mr. valentine , what do you think is wrong with this aircraft ? - There 's an engine out . - Which one ? The one on the outside . Outboard number one . It 's out , isn 't it ? - What makes you think that ? - Never mind about that . It 's true , isn 't it ? Nine minutes ago , outboard number one was struck by lightning . There was a fIame-out , and we lost it . - Lightning . - Lightning . Mr. valentine , this aircraft has four engines . The possibility of us losing one of the remaining three is remote in the extreme . You 're sure it was just lightning ? absolutely . Listen , we 're gonna be landing in about 20 minutes . There is the highest probability that we 'II survive this flight . Okay . We 'II see you downstairs in 20 minutes . Sit down . buckle them up ! Are you okay ? No , no , no , no . I Iove you . hall Mary , full of grace , the Lord is with thee ... Mommy . Mommy . Mommy . What are you doing now ? That 's very bad manners , you know ! - Didn 't anyone ever teach you manners ? - Come on . Come on . God damn ! He 's got a gun ! And that 's exactly how it happened . I 'm practically a hero . would you believe that ? ... weather broke , we would never have gotten this baby down . A hell of a night . We got the storm , we got the fIame-out , and then that freak show . Not to mention the gun . The gun was awful . He didn 't have a gun . No , no , no , he didn 't have a gun . It was my gun . It was my gun . I 'm FAA . I 'm authorized to have a gun . He was so crazy . He smashed the window . What was he trying to do ? Get out ? It 's claustrophobia ! They 'd rather fall to the ground than stay aboard . I 've seen it happen . I 've seen it ! I knew he was frightened , but I didn 't think he was crazy . But , Dionne , he said he saw something on the wing . Max , we lost number one . Check out number two , will you ? AII right . Somebody give me a light . I want the gear pin . Let 's check these tires . Franco , Iet me know what 's going on with these flaps . I want to know if there 's any fuel leaking out of this baby . And get these people out of here . Max ! Max ! Max ! holy toledo ! Hey , you guys , what happened up there ? That 's enough of that noise , huh ? Who needs it anyway ? How about a little music ? Sure . Hey , that 's ... That 's ... I Iove Creedence . So you had a big scare up there , huh ? Oh , yeah . Want to see something really scary ? There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man . It is the middle ground between light and shadow , between science and superstition , and it lies between the pit of man 's fears and the summit of his knowledge . This is the dimension of imagination . It is an area which we call the Twilight Zone . english

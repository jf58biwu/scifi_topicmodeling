 ( MAN YELLING ) Lawrence of Arabia ? ( SCREAMS ) Save yourself , kid . Bogg ! You 've got to calm down . The Omni ! Where is it ? This is Thomas Edison . He probably invented the thing . You 've wrecked it ! Now I 'll never get back to Bogg ! Make room for our two new guests . And in the morning , you both die . BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! Warm it in your hands . What makes you think my hands are warm ? This is great . Just terrific . Stupid Omni brings us to the middle of Siberia , ( DINGS ) Green light all the way , and the stupid thing won 't take us out . What do you expect ? That thing 's at least 20,000 years overdue for servicing . So service it . If I had my guidebook , I would . But my guidebook is back ... With my mangy mutt in 1982 . Thank you . Now keep moving or you 're gonna freeze to death . Freeze to death ? Ten more minutes of this and I 'm gonna be a popsicle . Move ! ( GROANS ) You know , they found frozen mastodons here in Siberia . Yeah ? Those big hairy elephant things ? Yeah . They were perfectly preserved after 10,000 years . So ? So maybe we should let ourselves freeze . Thousands of years from now , somebody 'll find us , thaw us out ... ( LAUGHS ) Good idea . Did the mastodons come back to life ? On the other hand ... I think I got it . Hold on . ( DINGS ) Think warm thoughts . I 'm thinking . ( BEEPING ) Bat 's breath ! Come on , Omni , give us a little warm ... ( SNEEZES ) ( WIND WHISTLING ) ( EXPLOSION ) There , it worked . ( EXPLOSION ) Come on , kid . Under the wagon . Where are we ? I don 't know , kid . But you wanted it warm . You got it warm . Thanks . ( BEEPING ) 1917 . You got any idea what 's going on here ? JEFFREY : A major hassle . BOGG : Yeah , I figured that . Can you be a little more specific ? Those guys are Arabs , I think . What do you mean , you think ? Well , they 're dressed like Arabs . BOGG : What about the others ? JEFFREY : Well , they 're dressed like soldiers . This isn 't a fashion show . I need names , places . Well , ask that broken-down , Mickey Mouse watch of yours . I 'll deal with that smart mouth of yours later . At least we 're safe for now , under this wagon . ( EXPLOSION ) Let 's get out of here ! Come on ! Lawrence ? Lawrence ! It is Lawrence ! It is Lawrence ! Lawrence of Arabia ? Yes . Come on . We gotta help him . You stay where you are . But , Bogg , I wanna meet him . I 'll introduce you later . Bogg ! Bogg ! Help ! Bogg ! Help ! Jeff , get out of here ! JEFFREY : Bogg ! ( COUGHING ) Save yourself , kid . Bogg ! I can 't leave you ! Forget about me ! Hit it ! Hit it ! Get out of here ! Go on . Come on , Omni , work ! ( CHURCH BELLS RINGING ) Mary ! Lunchtime ! Come on , children . And don 't dawdle , Marion . Your father 's coming home for lunch . Any luck this morning ? Huh ? I said , did you have any luck this morning ? Confounded glass won 't hold a vacuum . What 's for lunch ? Well , I made sandwiches out of last night 's ... ( WIND WHISTLING ) Do you hear something ? Last night 's what ? Not that awful meatloaf again ? JEFFREY : Bogg ! That 's a voice ! Where you going ? Thomas , it 's a boy ! Oh ! Oh , boy . Oh , dear . Where did he come from ? He smells like a bonfire . ( COUGHING ) Maybe he 's inhaled too much smoke . The only thing smoking around here is this cigar . Poor thing . Let 's put him up on the porch . He looks just awful . Probably ate some of your meatloaf . I wonder who he belongs to ? I don 't know . I 'll ask the boys at the shop . Maybe they 'll know . Well , we 'll just keep him here until we find out . Poor dear . I wonder what could be so important . Thomas , what do you make of this ? ( BEEPING ) I 'll take it to the shop . Thomas , it 's the boy 's property . I won 't hurt a thing . You bring that back here right now ! What ? Thomas Alva Edison , you are an impossible man ! Can 't hear you . MAN : This is the day of celebration . Yesterday , your Arab tribesmen made a feeble attempt to take this city of Aqaba . The attempt was not only a defeat for them , but a more personal misfortune for your leader . So prisoners , you have a new companion . ( CROWD CHEERING ) Here he is . Here is your blue-eyed hero of your Arab army . This is the Englishman who says that you desert tribesmen can defeat the Turks . We must talk to him . There is no time for talk . We must help him . We cannot . Not yet . Welcome , Lawrence . To the prison at Aqaba . You may have failed your friends , but you have rewarded your enemies . The commandant became a rich man today . There was a tidy price on Lawrence 's head . Lawrence , I will leave you here among your people , so they may pay homage to their hero . Regrettably , not long . The Englishman has a long-standing appointment with a Turkish firing squad . Tomorrow morning , the eighth hour , you die . ( CHURCH BELL RINGING ) Well , hello , there , young man . How do you feel ? Where ... What happened ? ( CHUCKLING ) That 's what I 'd like to know . We found you out on the front yard . Bogg ! Really , you 've got to rest . You 've got to calm down . No . I 've gotta get back to him . Is Bogg your father ? The Omni ! Where is it ? Have you seen a metal thing ? It 's just about this big ? Looks like a watch ? Yes , ma 'am . Where is it ? I 've gotta get back to Bogg . Well , my husband has it right now . Do you know where he is ? Yes , he 's across the street at the shop . Thanks ! I really don 't think you should ... Edison . MAN : Hey , does anybody know what gauge wire he wants ? It 's not in the specs . Sixteen-gauge copper . And he wants the solders perfect . Is there any other way ? MAN : Pull this off the burner , will you ? Excuse me . Kruesi , I blow eight in two hours . Tell him if he does not find a vacuum in these , I quit . You tell him . Are you crazy ? That way I could lose my job . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) You 're the kid that owns that watch device . How did you know ? Mrs. E. Just called up from the house . Come on . John Kruesi . Jeffrey Jones . Yeah , the old man seemed real interested in that thing . Where did you get it ? A friend . Hope he was a good one . What do you want ? JEFFREY : The Omni . Well , kid , welcome to Menlo Park . You 've wrecked it ! It 's totaled ! Now I 'll never get back to him ! What ? You stupid idiot ! Now I 'll never get back to Bogg ! Hey , kid , easy . It 's all right , Kruesi . Let him yell . Don 't touch those parts ! Move one out of place and I 'll never be able to put it back together again . You can get it back ? Kid , this is Thomas Edison . He probably invented the thing . Not quite , Kruesi . Darn thing 's got me stumped . You know what it had ? A light . This thing had a red light . And it blinked on and off . It 's got a green one , too . How ? A good electric light hasn 't even been invented yet , and this thing has got one in miniature . This fellow , Bogg ... He an inventor ? No , not really . Not really , huh ? I can 't find a power source . I can 't find a lamp . I can 't find any good reason why this watch can produce light . And yet it does . Has he had it patented yet ? I don 't think so . Good . Good . Boss . What is it , Upton ? Mr. Lowrey is here . He 's got the big fellow with him . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Don 't touch those parts . Don 't worry , kid . He 'll put it back . Just right now he 's got bigger things on his mind . How close is it ? If they dig all day , maybe we can break through by sundown . They 're going to kill Lawrence in the morning . Yes . Must be tonight . Lawrence , are you hurt ? Stuck here in this humiliating pose , my ego is rather bruised . But apart from that , no other injuries . Thank you , sir . Thank you for your valiant effort to save me . What happened ? You were supposed to win here at Aqaba . The attack is still 48 hours away . Ours was only an advance troop sent to find any weak spots in the Turks ' defense . And ? And we were found out in the marketplace when one of my Arab comrades was thrown from his horse . His temper got the best of him , and he started shouting at the beast , in Arabic . Can 't the army be pulled back together somehow ? Well , I pray so . For as long as the Turks control Aqaba , they can take good aim at any ship in the Suez Canal and that makes them very good allies for the Germans . I could reunite them again , but not from inside this prison . And not from inside the grave that the Turks have sworn to bury me in . Quiet . I think he 's a friend to Lawrence . Or perhaps a friend to the commandant . We can 't trust anyone , Oman . Even Lawrence will have to wait . Now go . You 're not going to end up in any grave . Your friend , Jeffrey . Has he gotten away , then ? I hope so . I hope so . Wait , please . What do you want ? I 've watched you . You and your friend have been dropping dirt down the well . You 're mistaken . Are you working on a way out of here ? No . I 'm not going to tell anybody . If I had three wishes , she 'd be one of them . ( GRUNTING ) Bucketful of mud . Give it a few minutes to settle . Has the well gone bad ? No . Good well . It 's running fresh water for many years . Where 's the dirt coming from ? The tunnels . Escape tunnels ? Yes . Then there is a tunnel . I knew it . I saw some prisoners dropping dirt in the well . ( CHUCKLES ) Over the years I 've seen tons of dirt being dropped into that well . I 've dumped my share in over the years . You 're digging a tunnel ? Everybody 's digging a tunnel . Everybody ? Yes . The commandant has to find out sooner or later . He knows . He knows ? Yes . And he allows the digging to go on ? Prisoners are kept busy . The water table is high . The commandant knows he needn 't worry about escapes out of this place . Then there 's no way out . For you ? For Lawrence . Ah . There is one way . ( LAUGHING ) Oh , yes . When the commandant and his firing squad are finished , Lawrence will be free . Great . ( MUEZZIN CALLING ) EDISON : Now , the last lamp you saw had a platinum filament . And , as I recall , it burned for less than a minute . Yes , but we 're using lampblack now . Pure rolled carbon . Lampblack . That 's an interesting approach . Doesn 't look like they 're having much success with that either . All right . Close up the shades . The man without the moustache is Grosvenor Lowrey , one of the biggest backers of the Edison Light Company . Who 's the other guy ? The biggest backer . J.P. Morgan . Right . Upton , are you ready ? We 're ready , boss . Okay . Fire it up . Just a little bit at a time . You know , I don 't think this is the way it happened . What ? Forget it . Okay , a little more . More ! Okay ! EDISON : Good ! Now , I know it doesn 't look like much , but I think we 're on the right track . If you could just give us ... One week , one month , one year ? I think you could have all the time in the world , Mr. Edison , and you still couldn 't come up with a light that works . No , thank you . I 'm pulling me and my bank out of this mess . Good day . J. P ! Well , so much for the electric light . There goes our backing . But they can 't back out now . Edison 's gonna make it work . Not without Morgan 's money . Lowrey , talk to him . I can 't talk to Morgan when he 's got his mind made up . I 'm sorry , Tom . MORGAN : Coming , Lowrey ? LOWREY : Right there , J.P. Mr. Morgan ! Yes , son ? I haven 't got much time . You haven 't got much sense , either . What ? Please , son . Thomas Edison is the greatest inventor alive . The phonograph , the repeating telegraph . He even made the telephone work better . That is not what 's at issue . Look , you wanna make some money , right ? That 's the general idea , yes . Well , then what other inventor would you rather invest your money in ? Thomas Edison 's got a track record that just won 't quit . Track record . Interesting expression . You miss out on the electric light , and you 're gonna miss out on an invention that 's going to change the face of this world . It 's a gold mine here . You 're looking at a fortune . All right , all right . I give in . Thank God ! On two conditions . The first is that you , young man , come to see me when you 're an adult . I could use a man with your persuasion . Second is that I see some positive results in 48 hours . Otherwise , Tom , we 're back where we started . Good day . Forty-eight hours . Is he crazy ? Well , kid , it was a nice try . Forty-eight hours . Heck , I invented the phonograph in less than a day . Let 's go to work ! All right ! Is this the last of it ? The tunnel is finished . Then we will be ready in time . We can free Lawrence tonight . Good luck to us all . Fire ! Fire ! MAN 1 : Get buckets ! ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) MAN 2 : Get the buckets ! Get the buckets ! I need men over here ! Bring water from the well ! MAN : Come on ! Come on ! What 's going on ? I 'm getting you out of here . Well , then , you 're responsible for all this excitement . You got it ! Are you sure you 're not British ? This way . Fools . I need more men ! BOGG : Hurry . The horses are down here . Lawrence has escaped ! MAN : Call the commandant ! Lawrence has escaped ! Hurry ! Lawrence . Did you really think it was going to be so easy ? ( LAUGHING ) Clear a cell block . Make room for our two new guests . You 'll be less trouble if you 're locked up overnight . And in the morning , you both die . How 's it going , Kruesi ? This batch is ready to roll . Huh ? This batch is ready to roll ! Good ! Are you sure this is right ? I don 't even know what I 'm doing . What you 're doing is scraping pure carbon from these lamps into little piles . Exactly . What has that got to do with the electric light ? What I 'm doing is rolling the carbon into their filaments , which go into the lamps . Which light up when you put electricity through them . Got it . Problem is , it hasn 't been working . It 'd work , all right , if you could roll the darn things thinner ! Look at that filament , Kruesi . It 's a disaster . EDISON : Let the kid do it . He 's got smaller hands . Boehm ? Where 's Boehm ? Has he got those light bulbs ready yet ? We 've only got 36 hours ! Well , kid . The future of the Edison light is in your hands . ( MUEZZIN CALLING ) Well , it 's dawn . I 've gotta get you out of here . Down here , locked up , unarmed ? I have a cache of weapons stored just outside the gate , but they might just as well be in Buckingham Palace for all the good they 'll do us . So , we don 't have weapons . And we 're locked up down here . Outnumbered . We 'll think of something . Your optimism is appreciated , but I 'm afraid this is the end for me . I think I shall miss the desert more than anything else . Nearly all Europeans think of the desert as nothing , as an arid void . But I , I know it as a thing of rapture and beauty . It 's taken over my senses . Just as its people have taken over my heart . EDISON : That 's it ! Forget it ! You did your best , kid . We 'll make another one . One that 's better ! It 's a waste of time , son . Let 's just call it a day . No , you can 't . We still have four hours . Look , you could roll lampblack for four more years and it wouldn 't make a difference . It 's the wrong material , son . Back to square one . No . You got to invent the light . You got to . I will ! I will ! Just not today . What is it , the 20th ? The 21st ? ( SIGHING ) On this day , October 21 , 1879 , I am gonna take a good long nap , put the electric lamp away for a rest , and tell J.P. Morgan what he can do with his money . ( LAUGHING ) What do you think of that , son ? No ! Don 't you see ? You 're gonna mess everything up ! You still upset about this watch ? I can put it together in no time . No ! Get out there ! Make the light ! Do it ! ( CRYING ) If Bogg was here ... I messed up everything . Everything ! It 's been a long haul , son . Maybe I have pushed too hard . ( SNIFFLING ) Come on over here . I 'll sew that sleeve up for you . I think I 've got a needle and thread here somewhere . Come on . Come on over here . Mr. Edison ? Mr. Edison ? You put it in a kiln until it 's carbon . What ? The thread . It 's a perfect filament ! Upton ! Kruesi ! Quick ! Fire up the kiln ! I got it ! I got it ! EDISON : All right , Upton . Let 's give it a try . Yeah . More . More . An inch more . That 's it . That 's it ! ( ALL CHEERING ) That 's it ! Hey . Come on , you little teary-eyed monster . There 's nothing to cry about . We did it ! We did it ! I hope it works okay . You 're lucky if it works at all . This thing had the dirtiest movement I 've ever seen . What did you do to get it that way ? I don 't think you 'd believe me . ( GRUNTS ) I think that 's it . ( OMNI DINGS ) No leftover pieces . A green light now . Beautiful . I still can 't understand how it works or why it 's so tiny . It 's some kind of toy . What 's it supposed to be ? A time-travel machine . Time-travel ? ( LAUGHS ) Now that 'd be an invention . It 's a beautiful day for an execution . Plenty of light . No excuses for any of you to miss your mark . ( KEYS RATTLING ) Here 's your breakfast . I watched you escape last night . Congratulations . Would your escape have been any more successful ? We must be desperate . She 's a kitchen maid . She 's much more . She 's been secretly dumping freshly dug soil into the well out there . Is that true ? Yes . Then you do have a way out of here . I did . What do you mean ? The commandant has cleared the entire cell block for your security . So ? For months , friends of mine had been kept in the next cell . Well , then your friends should be grateful for whatever freedom our capture has afforded them . Your capture has cheated them of their freedom . LAWRENCE : How is that ? The tunnel . It 's down here . In the next cell . Girl , why didn 't you tell us this before ? Because I was going to show you . My friends and I were about to free you when he decided to rescue you . It wouldn 't have happened if you 'd been more honest with me . I couldn 't trust you with that knowledge . Then why should we trust you now ? Because she could be on her way out of here right now . I am not a martyr . All we 'd have to do is wait until you have both been executed and things return to normal . Right in the next cell . Might as well be in Buckingham Palace . Where 's the tunnel lead ? Into catacombs that run beneath the prison and out into the city . We must get to that tunnel . You cannot go alone . It is like a maze down there . You would get lost . Gentlemen . I hope you enjoyed breakfast . It was your last meal . It 's time . Your firing squad waits . Gentlemen . Even though we didn 't get out , it was a bloody good effort , Phineas . BOGG : Yeah , " A " for effort . Don 't blame yourself . The fire was a good diversion . Not good enough . No escape attempt would be good enough , gentlemen . There is no way in or out of this prison that I don 't know about . ( WIND WHISTLING ) COMMANDANT : Get them ! Stop them ! Great entrance , kid . What 's going on ? MEDINA : Follow me . This way . Get them ! Get him ! Up , you fool ! The catacombs are just beneath this tunnel . Up ! Up , idiots ! Get up ! Never mind about me . Get after them . Go ! MEDINA : Around this corner . ( RATS SQUEAKING ) BOGG : I was wondering when you 'd get back here . JEFFREY : I came just as soon as I could . You 'd never guess what happened . Later . Awful dark down here . There 's nothing to be afraid of . ( SCREAMS ) This is where we used to bury our dead . This way . LAWRENCE : Dark down here . I hear them behind us ! BOGG : All ahead . I got an idea . Thanks . Oh , wow ! Good work , old boy . Is it much further ? No . The exit is this way . Down here ! Somebody ! Help , somebody ! Quickly ! Come ! There . BOGG : Oh , no . We 'll dig it out . Hurry ! They made it through to the catacombs . After them ! Go ! Come on , everybody , start digging . COMMANDANT : Wait . Wait . Wait . ( SHUSHING ) This way . COMMANDANT : There 's no way out of here . They can 't escape . JEFFREY : Bogg ! I know , kid . I hear it , too . Keep digging . COMMANDANT : Up here . To the right . Bogg , Medina 's gone . MEDINA : Lawrence , hurry ! Bogg , they found us ! COMMANDANT : After her ! This way ! Get her ! We got to help her . No ! She knew there was only one way out . She 's a courageous woman . Bogg , the Omni 's still red . ( BEEPING ) We gotta get Lawrence out . Where are they ? The others ? Gone . Stupid little sewer rat . You 'll sacrifice yourself ? Who helped to dig that tunnel ? Show me the way out of the catacombs . How did Lawrence escape ? Lawrence has escaped . Lawrence has escaped ! ( CROWD CHATTERING ) Lawrence ! Lawrence ! PRISONERS : ( CHANTING ) Lawrence ! Lawrence ! Lawrence ! Lawrence ! Lawrence ! Listen . ( PRISONERS CHANTING ) We can 't leave Medina behind . We can 't take on the commandant and all his men . Phineas is rather like me . He doesn 't give much thought to odds . You said there were weapons stashed out here . Yes , guns , ammunition and some explosives . Come on . PRISONERS : Lawrence ! Lawrence ! Make them stop . Tell them to stop ! I could not even if I tried . Keep your secrets . Take them with you to the grave ! Lawrence ! Lawrence ! Never mind the girl . Get him ! Go ! You 're not going to escape . Medina ! Get me out ! JEFFREY : Bogg ! Bogg ! Bogg ! Hey , don 't worry , kid . I 'm not going anywhere without you . I promise . MAN : Lawrence ! Thank you , Phineas , my friend . My dear friends . Thank you . PRISONERS : ( CHANTING ) Lawrence ! Lawrence ! ( DINGS ) I hope he makes it . He will . Thanks to you . BOGG : Menlo Park , December 31st , 1879 . It may be Menlo Park , but it feels like Siberia . Quit complaining , will you ? It was your idea to come here . ( OMNI DINGS ) I can 't believe this . This thing is working like brand new . All right , folks ! It 's ready ! There 's the guy who gave it the overhaul . Has anybody seen Mr. Dooley ? He 's lit this street for the last 40 years . He 's going to light it tonight . Where you going ? Inside with Edison . I want to thank him in person . I already did . Beside , you don 't want to be inside now . Why not ? We 'll miss the whole thing ! What whole thing ? ( CROWD CHEERING ) ( CROWD APPLAUDING ) This the first time ? The very first . Isn 't it beautiful ? Yeah , kid . It 's beautiful . JEFFREY ...

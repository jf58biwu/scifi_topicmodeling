 Eighteen centimeters on the figure of osiris , doctor . Eighteen . Very good . And the representation of nefertiti , professor ? Uh , 12 centimeters . Excellent . And the last measurement ? Let 's see . Hathor is 11 . What is that ? Earthquake ! North wall is going ! Professor , are you injured ? No , I 'm okay . I 'm all right . God , earthquake . Abdullah , look . This is unbelievable . It 's a chamber , Abdullah . Please be careful , professor . Abdullah , this is incredible . What have you found , my friend ? Ankh Van Haris . Ankh-vanharis . Are you all right ? It sc- - it scared the hell out of me . There 's so many bodies , Abdullah . I 'm gonna need at least three of you on each side . Come on , give him a hand . Okay , carefully . Could you all sort of move around to the other side of the coffin ? Linda , this is fairly heavy . Must we pose right now ? Rossmore wants a bunch of publicity stills for their press conference tomorrow . - Tomorrow ? - Yeah . Seems we have no choice . Professor , could you move over here and smile at the mummy ? Well , these are clearly the original seals . Which means the fella inside hasn 't seen the light of day in approximately 3000 years . Okay , fellas . One on each side . Lift it carefully . Okay , easy . Put it right over there . Perfect condition . Can anyone translate the name ? Ankh vanharis . A male cognomen . Literally a noble traveler . Uh-huh . Meaning ? I guess he was a visiting dignitary . Why would they bury a foreigner in the tomb of king tut ? It 's a good question , Michael . Maybe we 'll find the answer in the scroll of dedication . All right , let 's go for the inner lid now . Carefully . Watch it , you idiot . Sorry , doctor . Sorry 's not gonna help when you break some of the machinery . Ready for the X-ray , sir . All right . Carefully . Can anyone tell me why the wrappings are so deteriorated ? A hasty burial . Minimum preparation . Yep . I 'd say that 's likely . What is that green stuff ? Mold ? I 'm not really sure . Michael , why don 't you collect some samples ? Okay , doc . Professor , why would he have been given a hasty burial ? Well , until we remove the wrappings and examine the body , we 're not gonna know for sure , but my guess is ankh-vanharis died from some kind of disease , such as plague or smallpox . Or whatever it was that disfigured and killed his attendants . Susie , bring me an airtight container . I wanna seal this up until we can give it a proper cleaning . Michael ? Just about done , doc . All right . All right , I think we 're ready for the x-rays . Thank you for your help . And I 'll see you all later . Okay . - Thanks , doc . - Bye . Great stuff . Thanks . So long , Parker . No , I 'd like Mr. Parker to stay . After all , he is the chief engineer . Ready , aim , fire . Ready , aim , fire . Ready , aim , fire . What are you doing , you moron ? Doug , look at that . My god , sharpe . One of those damned kids must 've knocked it off the setting . You 've been x-raying this mummy with 10 times the normal dose . Okay . So we 'll start again . Let 's not . It 's had enough radiation for one night . Just deliver those plates to my office . That 's a little over-exposed . That 's okay . What the hell could those be ? Oughta be right about ... There . Gotta match the dose . Don 't worry , big fella . This isn 't gonna hurt a bit . A perfect match . Well , if I can 't get it ... X-rays . Um , just put them over there . I wanna finish cleaning this scroll . Ah , susie . I don 't know , Ken . Some kinda dormant mold . Great . I 'll have susie run it over . Yeah , thanks , Ken . Ken Melrose in pathology can start analyzing it right away . Can you bring it over to him ? Do you mind ? Of course not . Maybe he 'll show me his new electron microscope . Well , what have I got that can compete with that ? Mm . Oh , honey , before you go , what do you think of this ? I found it rolled up in the scroll . Magic symbols ? Astrological diagram ? Look at the material . I 've never seen anything like it . It 's not papyrus . It 's not leather , cloth- - well , maybe you found the first civilization to use polyester . What a dismal thought . Don 't work too late , doc . I 'm sorry . Did I startle you ? Oh , susie , what time is it ? You 're gonna look worse than ankh-vanharis at the press conference . Susie , would you look at this ? Notice the cranial structure , the line of the spinal column . Maybe there 's something wrong with the X-ray machine . No . No . Here , coffin came out perfectly . And look at this . Usually the internal organs are removed and prepared separately , but here they 're all intact . This mummy hasn 't been prepared in a standard manner . What 's this ? Probably a hidden compartment for personal jewelry . That 's not unheard of . Well , we 'll find out . What is this stuff ? Don 't touch it . Get Ken Melrose and tell him something has happened to the mold . Hurry ! Go on ! Worthless . Worthless ? What do you mean , " worthless " ? I mean they 're not precious . They 're 3000 years old . They 're ancient , man . Well , who told you that ? Some hustler in a swap meet ? Forget it . Clown . Uh , it is the same fungus . But it 's definitely no longer dormant . And you have no idea what it is . No . And until we find out , don 't let anyone near it . That 's not gonna be easy . Rossmore 's scheduled a press conference for today . He wants to introduce ankh-vanharis to the public . Okay , doc . I 'll call Rossmore and tell him he simply must cancel it . Thanks , Ken . I appreciate it . Evening news . Is this the stiff ? Michael , see if you can find something to rope the coffin off with , please . Suse , be sure everyone stays clear of the coffin . Including you . Doug . He wants to talk to you . No , we don 't know for sure that it 's dangerous . Look , I 'll get back to work on this , and if I learn anything , I 'll- - I 'll call you . Thanks , Ken . Thanks . Get him to the campus hospital . To the emergency room . Call Melrose as soon as you get there . And don 't touch his hand ! Please just , uh , have a seat , please . Mccadden , what is the meaning of all this commotion ? One of my students was just burned by this fungus . Fungus ? Come on . You know damn well what I 'm talking about . Melrose and I tried to warn you about this . Mccadden , you know i really resent being blamed for the clumsiness of one of your students . Now , if you 're unwilling to accept the responsibility for this project , perhaps we ought to find someone who will . Ladies and gentlemen , good morning . My name is Wendell j . Rossmore . Today we are formally announcing the permanent acquisition of a major artifact from the tomb and the treasure of tutankhamen . When we uncover the mummy , you 're gonna notice that the wrappings are very deteriorated and covered with a green substance . This may make him seem rather unattractive , but please remember he 's been in there for 3000 years . Gentlemen , you may remove the inner lid . Hey , look , I wasn 't the only one in the lab that night . Don 't you belong to a fraternity , sharpe ? Yes . So what ? Hey , Pete , I was a frat man . I know what it 's like . Slow night , nothing to do . - Have a couple of beers- - - steal a mummy ? That 's a great theory , captain . Try to prove it . Why , you little- - hey , listen , why don 't you ask Parker where he was that night ? I saw him there . Dr. Rossmore , Jack Parker is not a suspect . The most important thing is we 've got to find the mummy . We 've got to counteract the bad press generated by that disaster this morning . - Uh , sharpe ? - Yes , sir ? I want you to spread the word through the fraternity houses . I 'm offering a 24-hour amnesty to get the mummy back . Now , if he is not returned , I am going to close every frat house and search every room on this campus . Yes , sir . All right . Uh , sharpe and Parker , you may go . Captain , I think the city police should be brought in on this . Absolutely not . Now , come on . This is an internal affair . We don 't need ' em . You 're overreacting , Doug . That mummy could be dangerous . There is something on the wrappings . Something very strange . There 's already a boy in the hospital . Anybody else who touches that mummy could end up the same way . If that 's so , whoever has taken the mummy is going to end up in the hospital sooner or later . And then I 'll nab ' em . And nobody has to know about it . Not the police , not the press . Fine . We 'd better find that mummy before somebody else gets hurt . Hey . Hey , what 's goin ' on back here ? Captain Willoughby , I want you to search the campus . Turn it upside down if necessary , but find that mummy . Yes , sir . You got it . Here 's why I 'm so concerned . The structure is just crazy . The nucleus is unstable , the chromosomal pattern is mystifying , and the cells are multiplying at a rate so fast , I can hardly measure it . Yes ? We 'll be right there . Yes , whatever it is , it 's highly delatropic . It breaks down tissues faster than anything we 've ever encountered . And it doubles its mass reproductively every 65 minutes , provided it has enough food . Food ? Well , any organic tissue . In this case , human flesh . Hi , doc . I 'm sorry I screwed up your show . It 's okay . You were upstaged by the disappearing act anyway . When you find that guy , I want to be the first one that knows . You got it . Mind if I take a look at that hand ? Sure , doc . Take care of yourself , Michael . Okay . Dr. fehr , Dr. fehr . You 're needed in emergency ward number 4 . Please answer extension number 75 . What 's the prognosis ? Well , there 's no skeletal damage yet , but the nerves , tendons , musculature , circulatory vessels are virtually destroyed . Excuse me , Dr. Hayworth . Mrs. Goldstein is here . Fine . I 'll be right there . Excuse me , gentlemen , but I will stay in touch . Wait a minute , doctor . Truthfully , what can you do for him ? Amputate before it goes any further . Ooh . Oh ... go- - what were you doing ? Sh- - sherri , honey , i came over to see you . Then , what were you staring at her for , bozo face ? Ow ! I don 't know ! Sherri ! - Hey ! - I hate you ! Listen- - sherri , will ya listen for a minute ? Come on , baby . Don 't be mad . I brought ya a present . [ Sniffs 1 what ? Gimme a kiss first . No way . No kiss , no present . Oh- - okay , where 's my present ? Wow . Where 'd you get this ? I found it in an old box . Dr. serrano ? Yeah , this is captain Willoughby . Yeah . Look , I 'm in the electrical supply room . President Rossmore told me to call you if I saw anything suspicious . This is Linda flores taking your requests tonight . So give me a call at 662-8200 . And now , to Brian from sheilagh , and to Christy from all the guys at delta psi- - so this is where you hide out when you 're not taking my picture , huh ? Cheapest rent on campus , right next to the reactor . Hi , I 'm Jamie Reynolds . And so am I. No , I 'm dick traveland , and this is tonight 's edition of two on one . Today , here at the California institute of the sciences , they held a press conference to show off their new mummy , but when they opened the coffin , guess what ? It wasn 't a mummy . It was a daddy . Oh , my god . No , it wasn 't anything . The coffin was empty . Em pw ? As a tomb . I wonder how much they paid for that thing . Whatever it was , it was too much . Jamie , I think the institute is in grave trouble . Oh , dick . Sorry . At any rate , it all started this morning when Wendell j . Rossmore of the institute called a press conference to show the world their find . It 's worth over a hundred bucks . I could let you have it for say , 50 . Hey , where am I gonna get 50 bucks ? Hey , come on , Greg . I know you got paid today . Just imagine what Ellen 's gonna think when you walk in with a present like that . Name your restaurant , baby . To our love . Forever . It 's nice . Um , excuse me . Sherry , I 'll be right back . Hey . Brother sharpe ! Imagine meeting you here ! Yeah , especially in this outrageously expensive restaurant with nine different kinds of forks . How do you suppose he can afford a place like this , brother Robinson ? Hey , look , it 's hard to figure , brother Vogel , especially since he owes us 25 bucks apiece . Hey , look , come on . I need that . I just ordered the food . That 's okay . We 'll pay for it . We 'll eat it , too . Look , I 'm here with sherri . Okay . We 'll eat her food , too . Hey , listen , I know we can , uh , share the food . But , listen , we have to flip for the lady . Tails seems appropriate ? Hey . How would you guys like to double your money ? Wow . Yeah . You give that to a girl , she 'll never forget you . Okay . It 's a deal . Hey , baby . - Oh ! - Mm shh . Don 't wake the baby . I promised miss mcginnis I 'd be really quiet . Come on . Tadaa ! What time are they gonna come home ? Not until midnight . This is Linda flores on kcis . And now , a special message for those naughty boys and girls who took the Institute 's mummy . Here 's my in-studio guest , our own professor Douglas mccadden . Thank you very much , Linda . To whom it may concern : The fungus on the mummy 's wrappings is extremely dangerous . If you have come into contact with it , please seek medical attention at once . If you discover the mummy , do not touch it . Call the police or the institute or even this radio station . Lemme know what happens . I promise you 'll be the first reporter on the scene . Thought I lost it there for a minute . Guess it must 've fallen out of my pocket and into the baby 's crib . He sure liked it . I hope you do , too . Greg , it 's beautiful . Hey . It wasn 't glowing like that when I bought it . Oh , it 's so warm . Damn ! Can 't you let the kid cry ? He wants his doll . I 'll be right back . Can you treat her ? Oh , lt . Hummer , I believe you know our pathologist , Ken Melrose . - Of course . - Lieutenant . And this is professor Douglas mccadden of the institute . - How 're you doing ? - Professor . I 've brought lt . Plummer up to date on everything . Doctor , what about Ellen ? Well , I 'm consulting by phone with Dr. Cunningham of the Atlanta center for control of disease . Oh ? You expecting an epidemic ? No , but if anyone knows anything about unusual disorders , it 's Atlanta . We 've sent them samples . They have all of our data now , you see . And what have they come up with ? So far , nothing . I understand there was a witness to this accident involving the girl . Yeah , her boyfriend , uh , Greg hauser . He 's here in the hospital now . Okay , hauser . Describe the attacker . Was he black ? White ? Come on , let 's hear it now ! Don 't sit there ! Talk ! That 's enough , Willoughby . I 'll take it from here . Hey , plummer , this kid saw the guy who did it . I 'm trying to get a description , but he won 't cooperate . That 'll be all , captain Willoughby . Greg , this is lt . Plummer from the police department . He wants to ask a few questions , that 's all . Greg , was it ? Okay , Greg . Just tell me what you saw . A horrible ... Face . Whose face , Greg ? Whose face was it ? Mummy . Look , he 's still in shock . I think I 'd better take him under observation for a few hours . Greg , come with me . How 's Michael Goldstein ? They had to amputate . But I think they got it all . Ken . How 's Ellen this morning ? Uh , Dr. Hayworth wants to try a surgical laser , to burn the fungus off , just as soon as they make sure there aren 't any broken bones or- - I took a look at these x-rays you sent me . What did you think ? You were right . Skeletal structure is abnormal . An extended clavicle , oversized sternum , displaced mastoid process- - Doug ? - Hi , Ken . - Hi , susie . Ken , I want you to listen to this . I think I 'm onto something . This scroll , it basically tells the story of king tutankhamen 's soldiers discovering a stranger in the desert . All right ? Because of his unusual appearance , the Egyptians assumed him to be a god , sent to advise their own god king . So king tut goes forth to greet this deity , whom he calls " ankh-vinharis " . Now , listen to this . " All-knowing tutankhamen reached out to touch the weary traveler and was sorely burned and afflicted with a disease that consumed his flesh . " Hm . " Likewise were all servants who laid soothing hands on the boy king . All died , save only the strange traveller himself , who lay near death and without strength , but who would not pass into the afterworld . " So they simply sealed him alive in a corner of tut 's tomb , along with all the afflicted servants . Tell me something . Are you suggesting that our fungus is the same disease that killed tut and his servants ? And it 's been dormant for 3000 years ? And now it 's not ? Suppose it were true . Okay , just suppose . What would we have to do ? We 'd have to figure out how it was stimulated out of dormancy . Then we might know how to stop it . Well ? But , Doug , it 's an unbelievable concept . What else have we got ? Damn it ! Have you seen this ? We look ridiculous . We were seen on every channel . Mm-hm . And look at this . " Where is my mummy ? A fraternity party Saturday night . Please wear costumes . " That 's all we need . Oh . Get me Dr. Hayworth . It 's an emergency . Get a hold of her ! Tell her not to X-ray Ellen winters . Do not X-ray Ellen winters ! Dr. Hayworth , call the operator . Stat . Gosh . - Hi , susie . - Hi , Stanley . Can I talk to you for a minute ? Not right now , okay ? I 'm really in a rush . What is it ? Are you still going out with professor mccadden ? I don 't think that 's any of your business , Stanley . Now , if you 'll excuse me , I 've got a very busy schedule . Well , look , I 'm sorry . This conversation hasn 't gone as I 'd hoped it would . Here , take this . I can 't take this . Take this , think of me , and maybe I 'll see ya sometime . Stanley ! I don 't see anything . Let 's get out of here . What was that ? Eh ... Nothing but a damned door . Keep looking . Somebody must 've broke in . It 's the fungus . The mummy walks ! Stop it ! Hey ! Mummy needs love . Mummy been in box too long . Get off of me ! Hey , look , man , i- - i was only kidding . Hi , Jack . How do I look ? Come on . As Cleopatra would say , " see ya later , guys . " Did he hurt you ? No . I 'm all right . Thanks for being there . Conehead ! Peter ! Grow up . Just grow up . I swear , you are such a dork sometimes . Gross . Hey , baby . You want maybe I should make you up like mummy ? I 'm Cleopatra ! I swear ... Hey , hold it down . You guys hear about the girl who got lost in king tut 's tomb ? Nine months later she was a " mummy " . Hey , Peter , I thought you were gonna wear a costume . Love your outfit , bill . Thanks . Love your necklace . It 's so unique . What 'd you do , get a truck load of those things ? Excuse us , pal . Enough of this crap . Now , listen , you pervert . You don 't disappear , I 'm gonna kick your bandaged butt . Who is that ? Just some chicken frat rat . Hey , have you seen Sarah ? I 've got a present for her . No . I think she 's outside . Thanks . Sarah ? Sarah ? Sarah , is that you ? No , she 's not Sarah ! And I sure as hell ain 't . You just wanna get lost ? Sarah . Bill . Jeff . Ready , Sarah ? Hey , Sarah , what is going on ? Sorry , buddy . This is only a two-seater . Hey , Sarah , what happened ? Damn ! That 's it . I 'm through with women . I 'm gonna be a priest . - Well , hello . - Hi . - How 's it goin ' ? - How are you , ladies ? - Nice dress . - I like you . I 'll be right back . - Where are you goin ' ? - Be right back . - See you later . - All right . Hey ! Look , I gotta go over to my office and check this out . Can I come along ? No , no . I 'll be right back . Really , I just wanna see if there was some sort of power drain . Be careful . Lock the door and keep it locked . It was on the wall right there , so whoever stole the mummy must 've stashed him in here . Oh , look who 's here . Come to change a lightbulb , Parker ? No , actually , I came to blow up the reactor . Hm . Hey , do you need any help ? Hey ! Hey , bill ? He 's dead . Hello . Yes , it 's he . Do I have the time right ? What ? I 'll be right over . Ah , professor . Thought you might be interested in this . What happened ? Well , we found this . It 's definitely from the mummy 's wrappings . Looks like somebody 's playing a very sick game . Please stay away from the green stuff if there 's any on him . It 's very dangerous . It can be fatal . I don 't think the fungus killed him . All right , what did ? Parker did it . - Impossible . - Why ? It looks like every bone in that boy 's body 's broken . There 's not a mark on him . We figure he hit that wall with incredible force . Well , Jack Parker 's pretty strong . Nobody 's that strong . I know you , Rossmore , and this isn 't the first time you 've tried to cover something up because you don 't wanna smell bad in the press . I beg your pardon , lt . You 're addressing the president of an accredited university . Don 't interfere with this investigation . Don 't withhold information . And don 't play detective . What about the mummy ? Well , you look for your mummy , doctor . I 'm looking for a murderer . Susie and I have been researching a theory of sorts . First of all , I wanna warn you , it 's gonna sound very unbelievable , but please just bear with me . I know it can 't be proved , but this fungus , I think we all agree it 's like nothing else we 've ever encountered . I 'd have to agree with that . Suppose it was because it didn 't come from earth . Where else would it have come from ? All right , Ken , you 've seen these x-rays of our mummy . You said he wasn 't a normal human being . Suppose he wasn 't a human being . Uh , doug - I said it would sound crazy . Remember the scroll . It said , " all who touched the weary traveller became afflicted and died except ankh-vanharis . " Because he was immune . Because he wasn 't human . We all agree that we 're dealing with something unknown , but I can 't , myself , take a quantum leap into the supernatural . I 'm sorry , professor , but with all due respect , we have to have some basis in fact . I 've got the best available equipment at my disposal , and I 've been- - I 've- - I 've come up with absolutely nothing . I mean , it simply does not exist . Look , Doug , the bottom line is this : Whatever it is , we still have to find out who took it and where it is now . Otherwise , more people are gonna get hurt . Thanks to mccadden , we are in deep trouble . Two of our donors have withdrawn their bequests . 500,000 dollars out the window . Aw . Maybe there 's a way of turning this whole thing around . How , Bruce ? How ? - What if he stole the mummy ? - Huh ? He wasn 't ready to unveil that mummy , so he had it stolen and hidden where he could work on it in private . And then when he 's ready to find it and unveil it , he 'll find it and come out a big hero . No . I don 't think that scenario 's going to hold water , Bruce . I do . And I think I can prove it . You don 't think it 's walking around on its own , do you ? Oh ! There 's something out there ! - What ? - Lt 's in the hall ! Come on , Doug . Wake up . What time is it ? You 've been sleeping all day . You must have been really tired . Doug , look . Where 's that coming from ? My bracelet . Suse , that looks exactly like the diagram that I found inside the scroll . That can 't be a coincidence . Susie , where 'd you get this bracelet ? Well , it was a present from this guy named Stanley . Do you know where it came from ? No . Susie , can you call him ? - Now ? - Yeah , honey . It 's important . That diagram and this crystal have the same pattern . They 've gotta be related . I 've seen that pattern before , i know I have . Or something like it anyway . When you asked me about in your office , I couldn 't remember , but- - what , hon ? What ? I know . My brother used to build radios , and I think he had diagrams lying around that looked like that . Radios ? Radios . You know , maybe Parker will know . - This was in the coffin ? - Yeah . It 's amazing . It looks like some kind of wiring schematic . Like for making radios ? Right , but what would it be doing in a 3000-year-old coffin ? Jack , could this have something to do with it ? Maybe . Crystals could be used as transmitters . Jack , look at this . What 's goin ' on , Doug ? There must be a connection . If this did belong to ankh-vanharis , what would he have used it for ? I mean , he couldn 't have been building radios in ancient Egypt . Susie , I want you to go to the astronomy center , see what else you can find on ancient phenomena . But also , check out those NASA information bulletins on ultra-long-range communication . Honey , if you don 't find anything , come right back . Okay . What 's it printed on ? This doesn 't feel like paper . Analysis came up a blank . It matches no other material , either natural or synthetic . Like nothing else , huh ? It 's like the fungus . And ankh-vanharis . Where 's everybody ? Field trip . They all went to the observatory . To see some comet or something . Thank you . There 's definitely a connection between the two . It 's logical , but I still don 't know what it means . Let me have another look at that crystal . Susie ! No ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Let me out ! Oh ! And the next thing I remember is waking up here . Okay . I appreciate you answering these questions , miss Fuller . If you think of anything else , give me a call , okay ? Lt. Hummer , you don 't really still believe this is a fraternity joke , do you ? No . No , I think this is a very sick individual . - But , lieutenant , it 's- - - try to get some sleep now , okay ? Ow ! Damn ! Ow ! Suse , what happened ? Doug , you know me . I 'm not the hysterical type . But it was him . It was ankh-vanharis . He 's alive . He didn 't wanna hurt me . He just wanted my bracelet . My- - my crystal bracelet . It was glowing . And he- - he had a crystal just like it in his chest . Wasn 't Ellen wearing jewelry , some kind of necklace ? Yeah . So was bill Vogel , according to the coroner . Susie , do you know if there 's any more of those crystals ? No , I don 't . I 'm going back to my office and check out that schematic again . Go ahead . It 's okay . Jack . Come on , Doug . We got him . He was here . What 's that ? How did these get here ? One , two , three , four , five . - Crystals ? - Sharpe . - Hey ! - Where 'd you get those crystals ? What crystals ? The ones you 've been selling your friends . L- - i- - I got ' em at the swap meet . Sharpe , don 't lie to me . What about these ? Ellen winters and bill Vogel are dead . Because of those crystals . And susie Fuller 's in the hospital . I didn 't mean for anyone to get hurt . Where are the rest of ' em ? There 's one in my top drawer there . I gave the other one to my girlfriend . - Sherri ? - Yeah . Oh , my god . She 's jennie 's roommate . All right . Call your girlfriend right now . She 's at work . Call her . Suppose he is building a long-range communication device . He 's got the circuitry , he 's got the electrical transformer , he 's got most of the crystals . What else does he need ? A power source . Did you find her ? Yes , but she doesn 't have it on . It 's at home , bathroom cabinet . Jennie ! Bus ) ' - I 'm going over there ! All right . I 'll meet you at the reactor . Okay , mom . Love to dad . I love you , too . Bye . No . No . Please . No . Linda , this is professor mccadden . Get your camera and come over to the reactor building . Linda , now . Jennie ! Jennie ! Jennie . Did he touch you ? No . He took the crystal . Thank you , Douglas . What are you guys doing here ? Proving my theory . I knew all along that you 'd taken that mummy and now I know where you 've hidden it . - What ? - Oh , come off it , professor . Don 't you realize what has been going on here ? Yes , as a matter of fact . You 've been getting away with murder . Well , the game is over . And as soon as I call lt . Plummer , you 'll be on your way to jail , and I 'll have what I deserve . Jack ? Shoot it ! No ! The crystal ! No !

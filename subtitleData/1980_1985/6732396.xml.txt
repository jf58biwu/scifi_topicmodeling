 Check the heart line . Are you hyperventilating the patient ? No , doctor . Ready the bone wax . Metzenbaum scissors . Metzenbaum scissors . Get that cat out of here . Yes , sir . Ready to close . Remove the Weitlander retractor . We 're closing , doctor . Remove the Raney clip , for god 's sake . I appreciate your letting me observe that brain operation today . It would 've been more complicated if he 'd needed one , but since you wanted to observe my technique , I ... That was very nice of you . Doctor , were you , uh , were you interested in science as a child ? I don 't know if I was interested so much in the science as I was the slime that goes along with it . Snakes and frogs . When I saw how slimy the human brain was , I ... I knew that 's what I wanted to do with the rest of my life . What 's the matter , Timon ? I thought you liked fish . They taste funny . Really ? It 's fresh . It came right out of that tank . You hooked my angel fish ? ! Why do you do these terrible things ? Because I love to see those veins in your temple throb . You ... you ... I 'll kill you . Look here , you devil woman , you 'll never do this to another man ! Oh , yes , I will . I 'll do it , and I 'll do it , and I 'll do it again . Would you read that back to me ? I 'm afraid that might make me sound pompous to your readers . Uh , " my brilliant research in brain transplantation " is unsurpassed and will probably make my name live beyond eternity . " No , that 's all right . Take out the " probably . " It makes me sound wishy-washy . You take your hands off me , you impotent prune ! Ohh ! My Renoir ! I 'll kill you ! I get so excited when you get angry . It makes me feel so much closer to the reading of the will . You won 't get a penny . I changed my will months ago . You son of a bitch . Well , I guess I 'll just have to find me a new man to torture . Dr. Furrier ... That 's ... Hfuhruhurr . I 'm sorry . That 's all right . A lot of people mispronounce it , but it sounds just the way it 's spelled . H-f-u-h-r-u-h-u-r-r . Hfuhruhurr . Hfuhruhurr-rur . That 's good . You just went a little past it there . Just put the brakes on a little sooner . Doctor , I , uh ... I know you were quite shaken by the tragic death of your wife . Oh , I couldn 't talk about it for a long while , but ... Time passes by , and I can handle it now . Her name was Rebecca . Why ? ! Why ? ! Why ? ! Why ? ! Is Ookums having a massive heart attack ? What a shame , with me so young and hot ! Pom-pom ! Rip her throat out ! Aah ! Why ? ! Why ? ! Why ? ! Why ? ! Why ? ! Why ? ! Dr. Furrier ! Hfuhruhurr ! I 'm sorry . She was ... Everything . Is that her ? No . That 's just a statue of her . Our gardener Ramon , he ... He made made that for me after she ... I love the way her head moves . She almost looks ... Alive . Watch out ! Bye-bye ! An angel . Little girl ? Yes , sir ? I want you to do something very important , all right ? OK . I want you to run home , and I want you to call the E.R. of North Bank General Hospital , 932 1000 . Tell them to set up O.R. 6 immediately and contact anesthesiologist Isadore Tourick , 472 2112 , beep 12 . Have them send an ambulance with a paramedic crew , light IV , D-5 and W , KVO . You got it ? E.R. , North Bank General Hospital , 932 1000 . Set up O.R. 6 , contact anesthesiologist Isadore Tourick , 472 2112 , beep 12 . Ambulance with paramedics and light IV , D-5 and W , KVO . That 's good . Sounds like a subdural hematoma to me . Oh , it does , does it ? Well , it 's not your job to diagnose . But I thought ... You thought ! You thought ! Just go ! 3 years of nursery school , and you think you know it all ! Well , you 're still wet behind the ears . It 's not a subdural hematoma ! It 's epidural ! Hah ! Goddamn , that makes me mad . I don 't find this amusing , Garrero ! This is a better story than I ever hoped for . Beautiful woman gets hit by a car and needs brain surgery , and the man who hits her is the world 's greatest brain surgeon who operates on her and saves her life . If I save her life , Olsen . If . You wanted to see me , Dr. Brandon ? Ah , yes , Michael . This operation that you 're about to perform , I feel , is very ill-advised . No surgeon should ever operate on a patient that he has personally injured . It would make him too emotionally involved . Don 't you think I 'm aware of that ? But there 's only one other person I 'd trust to perform this operation ... Beckermann . Dr. Beckermann was murdered in Europe . You know that . Exactly ! Not only is he dead , he 's 6,000 miles away . What is that ? It 's a vagina . I know what it is . I mean what are you doing ? Shaving her . This is a brain operation . I know . What 's that supposed to be , a heart ? Yes , sir . Clive and I thought that since it 's Valentine 's day that ... You don 't have to shave her anywhere . We 'll be using my cranial screwtop method of entry into the brain . Fine . Yes , sir . I never want to see that again . I suppose if it were Christmas , you 'd hang ornaments on it . Forceps . Metzenbaum scissors . 10-blade scalpel . 10-blade . Sponge stick . Give me a little sweat on my upper lip . Remove sweat . Cover her breasts . I 'm a man , flesh and blood . Scat ! Damn ! The cats around here . Cranial screwtop . Now all we can do is wait . Yes . Where am I ? In a hospital . You 've had an accident . Oh . I hope I haven 't caused any trouble . Oh , no . I 'm so tired . Shh shh shh shh . Who are you ? Oh , I 'm ... I 'm your doctor . I want ... Oh , don 't ... Don 't try and talk . Doctor . Huh ? You 're wanted in O.R. 6 in 5 minutes . Thank you . Ohh . Continue the Dilantin IV . What a skull . Ohh . Boy , would I like to jump on those bones . Rebecca . I can 't help comparing her to you . She has a behind so sexy you 'd like to eat lunch off it . Just like we did , remember ? Rebecca . I 've had the top of her head off , but that 's as far as it went . I promise I 'll never recite our favorite poem to anyone but you . In Dilman 's grove . In Dilman 's grove , my love did die , and now in ground , she 'll ever lie . None could e 'er replace her visage , until your face brought thoughts of kissage . Nurse . Good . I 'm glad you 're here . Make a note . Right arm grip strength very good . Left arm 's ... there 's just no improvement . I went out and got you a little present . " The complete poems of John Lilyson . " " England 's greatest one-armed poet " ? He wrote in Dilman 's grove and pointy birds . I ... " oh , pointy birds , " oh , pointy , pointy , " anoint my head , anointy , ' nointy . " He died in 1894 . He was the first person ever to be hit by a car . To think you were almost killed by a car . Michael . That 's all over now . That man you ran away from that night ... Poor old Mr. Creswell . It was all my fault , in a way . I never should have gone there alone . I guess I 'm just too trusting . Oh , poor little bird . So fragile . So naive . So childlike . So shy . So chaste . So innocent . Rebecca . If there 's anything wrong with my feelings for Dolores , just give me a sign . No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Just any kind of sign . I 'll keep on the lookout for it . Meanwhile , I 'll just put you in the closet . In sickness or in health till death do you part ? I do . I now pronounce you man and wife . You may kiss the bride . Not now . There it is , darling . Your new home . The house of hfuhruhurr . What are those assholes doing on the porch ? Those aren 't assholes . It 's pronounced " azaleas . " I put them there for you . Señor . No , Ramon . My wife will not be entering her new home in a wheelchair . I want this moment to last forever . Señor ? Señor , would you like to eat your breakfast now ? Have you taken enough photos of the moment so we can remember this moment forever ? Oh , yes . And we got them back already . See ? Oh , that 's nice . All right , breakfast . We 'll get cleaned up first . One of my favorite people in the world is about to walk out here . I 'm happy to say he is still busy making his ... Look , I framed the moment . Mm-hmm . He 's now about to unveil his latest picture , which I hear is just amazing , opening on the 21st of this month ... Yuck . Wait . Turn that back . That 's my favorite movie . That 's Donovan 's brain . And not the slightest sign of decay ? None . I 've never seen healthier tissue . It 's growing larger by the day . It 's disgusting . Brains are so ugly . No . It 's beautiful . I 'm late ! Is that all you 're gonna have for breakfast ? It 's all I have time for . How do you feel ? Oh , I 'm fine . I just ... Wish I could get out of this wheelchair so I could help a little around the house . You will . You just had a major operation . It takes time to recover . You 're gonna be up and around in no time . Just be patient . Dolores ? Soon ? Huh ? Huh ? Forgot my hat . Ooh ! Ohh ! You walked ! You walked ! You walked ! I shouldn 't have gotten up , but I wanted to surprise you and walk into your arms tonight when you came home . You walked ! You walked ! You walked ! I love you so much . Who is that man out there ? Juan . He works for Ramon . Oh . He frightened me . He 's just a big , good-natured bag of muscles . There 's just something about him that makes me quiver . Is he here often ? Just one day a week . What day ? Tuesday . Is he ever alone ? I mean , does Ramon ever go off and leave him here alone ? Sometimes . Why ? I 'd like to know . Please , tell Ramon to warn me when he 's gonna leave me alone with that Juan person . All right , if that 'll make you feel better . That 'll make me feel much better . Frightened little mouse . I 'll tell Ramon to warn her about Juan . Ramon ! Michael , Michael , how is married life ? I don 't know ! I 'm sorry . I 've been on edge the last couple of weeks . I don 't know what I 'm doing . Michael ! Aah ! See ? That 's a perfect example . Oh , god , I almost peed in the scrub basin . I don 't know why I 've been so tense . Maybe it 's your coffee . No . When a woman who 's just had major brain surgery tells you she has a headache , you 've got to listen . Oh . Patience , Michael . A recently married woman and an eager young husband ... It won 't be long before you hear her say , " take me ! Take me ! " Take me . Take me . Ohh . Ohh , Juan . You ... You 're through ! I don 't think I am . Not you . By the way , I fired Ramon yesterday . Ramon ? But Ramon is such a fine man . What did he do ? He came up behind me , and he grabbed my breasts . What ? I haven 't even done that yet . I know . I told him that . You told him ? He said he had to measure me for a new dashboard ornament . He told me he had to measure Rebecca a lot before he got her right . Oh , you 're upset . So am I. I want to be everything to you Rebecca was . I want to give you ... Everything she gave you , do everything she did . When can you start ? How soon can you get home ? Well , I have 2 operations , but I can do them fast . They 're just brain operations . Let me get my hat . My briefcase . Could you walk me to the door ? What 's he doing ? 2 brain operations at the same time . Number 11-blade . 11-blade . 10-blade scalpel . 10-blade . Ready the bone wax . Metzenbaum scissors . Metzenbaum scissors . Get that cat out of here . Yes , sir . We 're ready to close . Cranial screwtops . Check for stripping . Take them to SICU . Bravo ! Bravo ! You 're so early . Yes . Take off your coat . And your paper hat . I 'm chilling some wine for us . Why don 't you open it ? Yes . Does this do anything for you ? Oh , yes . Good . I want our first night together ... To be exciting . I do , too . I hope the waiting hasn 't been too hard on you . There 's something I have to tell you . This fits very snug , and you may have some trouble getting it off me . You may have to tear it off my body . I can tear . I like tearing . You ... Man of steel . I can 't wait till next Thursday . Today is Monday . I know . But my headache should be gone by then . You don 't mind waiting , do you ? Oh . No . No , no , no . Not at all . I have a little headache myself . Maybe I 'll take a walk . It 'll do me good . Where 's my hat ? It 's ... The breeze feels good . You wanted to see me ? Michael , I 'm , uh , concerned about you . Really ? What 's the concern ? My staff tells me that you 've been a little tense lately . Tense ? Is that what they say about me ? Michael , even to me , you seem a little jumpy . Jumpy ? ! How are things at home , Michael ? Great . I 'm married to the most beautiful woman in the world . How could it be anything but great ? ! It 's gonna be even greater ! Just as soon as we ... 6 weeks and you haven 't made love to your wife yet ? No wonder you 're tense . Dr. Brandon , the woman has just had major brain surgery . She 's had enough unpleasantness . I 'll have you know that in the finger-sucking department I am extremely satisfied . Have you ever been to Austria , Michael ? No . The Austrian institute of Craniology has asked many times for you to lecture there on your theory of brain transplants . Why not take them up on it ? Combine a business trip with a honeymoon . Honeymoon . Yeah . I got to do something to get us started . When are you scheduled to have your hands removed from your face ? 3 : 00 this afternoon . Then you could do the Voigtlander surgery for me . Of course ! Have to be very careful with that instant glue . I know . Here 's the Voigtlander chart . A honeymoon . Yeah . Honeymoon ! May I help you , sir ? Yes , I 'm Dr. hfuhruhurr . I believe you 're holding a room for me . Yes . Would you prefer a double or twin beds ? A double . Ah , a double . Could you send up a bottle of champagne and put a " do not disturb " on the phone for the next ... Um , let 's see . We go in , put our bags down start kissing , be about 7 minutes . Move into the bedroom , slide my hands over her dress , I remove her blouse , maybe 4 or 5 minutes . Move over to the bed , rub each inner thigh , that would be 4 minutes each , so I figure 25 minutes of foreplay in general ... Do you call oral sex foreplay or actual sex ? Doesn 't matter . I 'd like to do it twice , so at least 3 hours , all right ? 3 hours ? ! Yes , sir . Take Mrs. hfuhruhurr and that lucky son of a bitch up to suite 729 . Yes , sir . I never in my wildest imagination ever thought it could be like that . It was the most exciting sexual encounter ... without actually having it ... that I ever almost had . Doctor , I 'm Dr. Felix Conrad . I 'll be escorting you to the lecture hall . Did you just step off that elevator ? There was no operator . They 're all afraid . You haven 't heard about Vienna 's elevator killer ? Elevator killer ? People have been getting on elevators on one floor only to arrive at another floor dead . Like Beckerman . Ja . Dr. Sclermie Beckerman . A brilliant brain surgeon . One of your colleagues . It was a great loss . I 'm thankful you 're all right . The academy is looking forward to hearing you lecture this morning . I hope I don 't ruffle any feathers . My speech might be a little radical for the old guard . It would take quite a bit to shock any of this crowd . Ladies and gentlemen , I can envision a day when the brains of brilliant men can be kept alive in the bodies of dumb people . What are they saying ? They 're just saying " murmur murmur murmur . " It 's just sort of a general murmur ? Yeah . Murmur . Oh . You may murmur all you like ... but to make transplantation possible I have recently invented the cranial screwtop method of entry into the brain whereby a large section can be unscrewed without having to shave the head . And as a safety feature , I 've made it childproof . To open , you push down while turning ... And voila , the human brain . Where is this man 's brain ? Stolen ! It 's the fourth incident this month . I wish to apologize to our American colleague . This demonstration is now concluded . Dr. hmfhruhrr ? It 's close . Yes ? I 'm Dr. Alfred Necessiter . Well , well , well . Dr. Alfred Necessiter . Would you like a drink ? A drink would be interesting . I enjoyed your lecture today . What lecture ? They gave me a head with 3 lemons in it . That 's why I enjoyed it so much . I didn 't have to hear your brilliant but old-fashioned theories on the human brain . What do you mean , " old-fashioned " ? I 'm the most advanced brain man working today . I don 't think so . Read this article . Look at the underlined part . And look at this . Read the caption under the photo . And these ... Newsweek , Time , Cosmo . National Enquirer ... Dolly Parton wants to have my baby . Don 't tell me I 'm old-fashioned . I didn 't mean to upset you , doctor ! You 're the most brilliant brain man working today . That 's why I 'm most anxious to share my work with you . It seems you 're the one person in the entire universe who might understand it . And I agree with what you said here . " My brilliant research in brain transplantation " is unsurpassed and will probably make my name live beyond eternity . " I told him to take out the " probably . " My laboratory is set up in my home . If you have a moment , I could show you my work . When ? Now ! All right . I can 't believe they didn 't take out the " probably . " You know , that photograph doesn 't do you justice . Well , hello . I didn 't expect to see you here . Ow ! Oh , you dirty ... What 's the matter ? You 'll have to forgive me . Being in Austria and meeting a scientist with your interests , I half expected your laboratory to be in a castle , not a condo . You mean ... Like this ? Yeah . That 's more like it . Jesus . This is extraordinary . From the outside , it does not look this roomy . I had a good decorator . My wife . It 's amazing what she did with a few throw pillows , some wallpaper , and a staple gun . Leapin ' lizards . Yes . We have those . Moat with alligator ... Here 's our small entrance hall . Do you have enough closet space ? There never is . No . They fill up so fast . This is the TV room . Oh , I love the way it 's so dreary . This , doctor ... Is my laboratory . Brains . I 've never seen so many brains out of their heads before . Feel like a kid in a candy store . Don 't touch it ! Why ? They 're alive . Alive . But there 's no wires or tubes or that " bzz " thing . How are they kept alive ? With a special fluid I developed . Why do you have all these brains ? My vision is to be able to take the thoughts and data from a dying brain and transfer them into another body without opening the skull . Would you care for a drink ? Please . What would you like ? A Tahitian lady . Right-o . Flaming ? Oh , no , no . That 's for tourists . Where do you get your brains ? The city morgue . For a nice tip they send me brains from bodies that have died in the right way . What is the right way for a body to die ? For my purpose , an injection of 200 ccs of ammoniated strychnoclorahype into the buttocks , causing the brain to die last . Thank you . Ammoniated strych ... that 's window cleaner . That 's the exact ingredients in window cleaner . Yes . And who does the injecting , Dr. Necessiter , you ? Good lord , no . It 's the elevator killer , bless his heart . You 're condoning murder , aren 't you , Dr. Necessiter ? As long at it 's happening , I 'm happy to accept it . The only time we doctors should accept death is when it 's caused by our own incompetence . Nonsense ! If the murder of 12 innocent people can save one human life , it will have been worth it . Worth it ? You 're condoning murder ! I 'm not condoning murder , sir ! Shut up in there ! Research and murder do not go together ! And you shut up ! With your TV blaring all night and your 6 grandchildren running down the halls ! I 'm sorry , doctor . These walls look solid , but they 're thin as tissue paper . That 's typical for a condo . Now , let me show you how far I 've progressed with my experiments . You knew a Sclermie Beckerman ? You 've got Sclermie in one of those jars like so much marmalade ? No ! He isn 't in a jar ! He 's walking and talking . That 's impossible . I saw photos of the body . It is possible . I must warn you , doctor ... What you are about to see ... Might strike you as the most incredible , awesome ... Excuse me . Incredible , awesome what ? Just a minute . Hello ? Yes ? I 'll be there immediately . Thank you . What was that awesome thing ? I must leave now . I have a new brain to pick . The elevator killer has struck again . What about Beckerman and incredible ? Come for dinner tonight and bring Mrs. Furrear . Hfuhruhurr . Hfuhruhurr . 8 : 00 . You can let yourself out . Now , if you will just turn around . Und lift your robe . Ja . Hi . What 's going on ? Don 't interfere . He 's paying me $ 15,000 just to touch my behind . You ! Get outta here ! Please , forgive ... Get out ! This kind of thing could ruin our marriage . Why ? Because you don 't want me to work ? Earn my own money ? Have my own career ? You call this a career ? Oh , I 've made those veins in your temple throb . Oh , I love that . Ha ha ha ! Dolores , our marriage lies broken on the floor like the shards of glass on our honeymoon suite ! Aah ! Oh ! 19th century Indian rubber vase , eh ? Dolores , I am making a citizen 's divorce . What ? By the powers vested in me , I hereby declare our marriage null and void ! E Pluribus Unum ! Jawohl ? I 'm Dr.Hfuhruhurr. Dr. hfurrrr ... oh , ja . You and your wife are expected for dinner . My wife won 't be coming . Oh . I trust she is not ill . She 's not ill . She 's a cheap , vulgar slut ! Ja , I 've heard this . Dr. hfuhruhurr , please . No , I 'm sorry , he 's not in . This is Mrs. hfurrr ... Ff . I 'm James Gladstone , calling from New York . I 'm the attorney for Dr. hfuhruhurr 's step-grandmother . I wanted to inform the doctor of her passing . Passing what ? She was cremated this afternoon . We need the doctor 's signature on some documents before we release his share of the estate . Um ... How big is the estate ? Rebecca ... Why didn 't you give me a sign ? I miss you . The fun we had .

I must at least have lips , a tongue , a throat . Nothing . Just a jar . Oh ! Oh ! Don 't cry . But how can I hear you ? Must be some kind of telepathy . What 's going to happen to me ?

Now , come on . Let me show you what I 've done for your friend Beckerman . Whup . Just one moment . What happened ? No one can hear you but me . Doctor ! Did you hear that ? No . You can 't hear anyone but me . It is some kind of telepathy . I 'm frightened . Don 't be . Things are never as bad as they seem . You still have your ... Brain . Dr. hfuhruhurr ! I 'll be back . Just stay here . I believe you know this gentleman . Is that Dr. Beckerman ? Sort of . See , I 've devised a machine that can transfer the entire contents of one brain into another brain . Understand , of course , that the brain of a gorilla is smaller than a human 's , so much of Dr. Beckerman 's vast knowledge couldn 't be accommodated . Dr. Beckerman ? That 's him all right . We never did like to shake hands with him . He must be lonely . Perhaps soon we 'll find him a companion . Come , doctor . Bye . I 'm going up to pack my clothes . Can you send the bellman up in 10 minutes ? Yes , sir . " My darling husband , " by the time you read this I will be dead . " My only regret is that I caused you pain . " I hope my insurance money " brings you some happiness . " May I burn in hell for what I have done to you . " My broken body will be lying " 7 floors below . " Au revoir , Dolores . " Aah ! No ! You 're alive ! Yes . But the scream ... I was rehearsing . Don 't come near me . Why are you doing this ? Because I 'm evil . You 're not evil . You 're sick . Sick ? Yes , from the operation . Just screw your head on a little bit tighter . You can be well . It 's no use , Michael . I 'm no good for you . And , besides , you divorced me . I 'm making a citizen 's annulment . Ipso Facto , coitus interruptus . I 'm coming to get you . No ! Stay where you are . I can 't stand hurting you anymore , Michael . Good-bye , my darling . No ! Take my hand . You 're safe with me now . Aah ! Put your arms around my neck . I hope this is strong enough for the both of us . Hang on . Uhh ! Uhh ! I don 't have any more saliva . I need yours . Uhh ! You 're all right now . Oh ! There . You 're going to the hospital . No , Michael , please . I want to make it up to you . When ? Thursday ? How about Monday ? Next Monday ? Today , Monday . Later today ? Now . Right now or later now ? Now now . Wow , wow . Oh , I love a clean , smooth , hairless chest . I mean hairy . Hairy . I never knew it could be like that . Oh , it was so ... So ... Professional . We are finally united under the holy laws of matrimony ... In sickness and in health , till death ... Do us part . Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Dr. hfuhruhurr . Is Dr. Necessiter in ? No , sir . May I wait for him ? Yes . I meant , may I wait inside ? Ja . May I wait in the laboratory ? Oh , I 'm afraid it 's locked , sir , but you are welcome to wait in the den . Make yourself comfortable , sir . Perhaps I could bring you a drink ? Yes . Uh , Tahiti tingle . A tingle . And take your time . Ah . Damn . Aah ! Are you all right , sir ? I 'm fine . I 'm fine . I just leaned against the door . The doors in this condo are paper-thin . Everything today is made so cheap . Here , look at this wall ... Like paper . Here is your drink , sir . Thank you . Now can I get you anything else , doctor ? I am about to retire . Really ? You seem so young . No . I mean retire for the night . Oh . Oh , no , thanks , I 'm fine . And don 't worry about this . I 'll have it replaced in the morning . Miss uumellmahaye ? Miss uumellmahaye ? Dr. hfuhruhurr ? Miss uumellmahaye ? Dr. hfuhruhurr ? Dr. hfuhruhurr . No . No . Dr. hfuhruhurr , what 's happened to me ? You 're a gorilla . I don 't feel like a gorilla . Well , you sure do look like one . But I ... I can 't be . I can 't see or touch ... Or anything . Miss uumellmahaye ? Call me Anne . Thank god . You 're still a brain . Oops ! Hey ! Why did you think I was a gorilla ? Because that 's what Dr. Necessiter has planned for you . But don 't worry . I have other plans . You 're in my room now . Where in your room ? In a ... On a gold leaf Florentine table by the window , overlooking a garden . Oh , I can almost smell the flowers . Phew . Sleep well , Anne . Good night , Michael . Good night . Mmm . You getting up ? Yeah , yeah , just getting up . Ahh . I 'll order us some breakfast . Yeah . Order me 2 sheets of bacon and a pillow . Hmm ? Hey , know what I 've been thinking ? There 's no need to rush home right now . I 'm due for a sabbatical , and there 's a lot of experimentation going on in this city ... A lot of scientists , a lot of brain research . You know , I could go out and look for a cottage , and I could set up a little laboratory . We could be very , very comfortable there . What do you think of an idea like that ? You think I should go out and look for one right now ? Whatever you want . Do you want me to go with you ? No , no , that 's not necessary , really . Oh , but I 'd love to . Oh , it 's so much trouble , the driving and the realtors . Yes ? May I take the table ? Oh , yeah , come on in . It 's really ... Ahem . Madame . Oh , you 're right . I 'd just be in the way . It 's best . I think I 'll just slip ... Out of these clothes into a hot bath . That 's great . That 's great . Yep . Ahem . You must be Dr. hfuhruhurr . Hfuhruhurr , yes . Can I give you a hand , sir ? No , I 'm fine . What do you have there ? You have a cute little kitty cat in there ? Hello , katze . Peekaboo . I see you . Ah , that 's cute ... All curled up in the little ball . Oh , you have no hair . Ohh ! Sorry . Um ... I 'd like to see the house . Sure . Guess what ? I found us a cottage , and I think we ought to go there right away . Well , what 's the rush ? Well , I set up an experiment , and I told it I 'd be right back . Oh , you 're dressed . Good . I 'll go get the car . Let 's go ! Why are you driving so fast ? I just want to show you our new home . What is this experiment you 're doing ? Just some boring brain stuff . Oh , you 're not going to have mice and rats in the house , are you ? No , no . Just some microscopes and test tubes and beakers and maybe a brain . A brain ? Just a small 4-pounder . You 'll never see it . I 'll keep it locked up . Ruth was the greatest baseball player of all time . You never saw Ruth play . On film , I did . Michael , are you on the phone ? Uh , yes . Well , I 'm waiting for you ... In bed . We 'll finish this tomorrow . Michael , it was fun tonight . It was fun for me , too . Don 't you want to make love ? Oh , yeah , yeah . That 'd be great . I 'll take this off . No , no , no . I can ... I can work around it . Oh , that feels so ... Over . What ? Are you going to be in there forever ? Uh-huh . I mean , uh , no , no . Just another couple of days . Oh . Well , I guess I 'll just go to town and try and find something to do . Oh , don 't go . Bye , darling . I can spend the whole day with you . Are you busy ? Yes , but I 'll cancel my appointments . The whole day . I don 't think there 's a girl floating in any jar anywhere who 's as happy as I am . Oh , Michael , you do so much for me , and I do nothing for you . Are you out of your head ? I 'm sorry . I forgot . As far as I 'm concerned , you 're the most complete woman I 've ever known . All my life , I wanted women with great bodies ... Women who were 10s . And now ... For the first time , I 'm aroused by a mind . Michael , I wish I could kiss you . I 've been thinking about that . Really ? Yes , really . I , uh ... I bought you a pair of wax lips . I was going to stick them on your jar . Is that crazy ? Oh , no . Please . How do I look ? Michael ? Yes ? Were you out on the lake today kissing your brain ? No . You didn 't take the rowboat out ? Funny . There was a man out there , looked just like you , kissing a brain . Must 've been somebody else . Somebody else ? How many men are there around here , do you suppose , who look exactly like you and have brains in jars ? Oh ... Well , around here , must be hundreds . Oh , stop it , Michael . I know there 's something weird going on with you and that brain . It 's not weird . It 's my work . Oh . It 's your work to kiss a dead brain ? She 's not dead . She 's alive . So , now it 's a she ! You care more about that brain than you do me . Michael , I am your cook , your maid , your lover . I 'm understanding about your work . I almost threw myself out a window because of you . And you , you treat me like a doormat . Dolores , I 'm sorry . I ... I just ... I didn 't realize what I was doing to you . Hello ? Who ? Mr. Gladstone ? What message ? What ? Grandma Nooney died ? No , she didn 't tell me . How much ? 15 million . First thing Monday . The day you learned about my inheritance is the day you started to be nice to me . What a coincidence . You only stayed around for the money . What other reason could there possibly be ? God ! It 's citizen 's divorce time ! Final decree ! Ugh . Son of a bitch . Ooh ! Help ! Help ! Anne ? Help ! Where 's my brain ? How should I know ? I 'm busy . I 'm cooking cervelles au beurre noir . Cervelles au beurre noir ? I know what that is . I had that once when I was in the army in France . It was a small café . I was young . I was impetuous . I 'd eat anything . Cervelles au beurre noir ... That 's ... that 's ... That ... Brains in black butter ! Ow ! Ooh ! Ahh ! Ohh ! OK , Anne . Oh , please say something . Uhh , I think I 'm all right . Count to 10 . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ... 10 . You ! You cooked her 9s . Out ! Out of my house ! Out of my life ! If you lay one finger on me , I 'll kill you ! You kill me , and I 'll see that you never work in this town again ! Nobody 's going to keep me from working in this town ! Ha ! Goddamn ! Uhh ! Uhh ! My balls ! Ow ! Ow ! I 'll get you ! I 'll get you for this ! I 'll get you for this , you nigger-kike-wop ! Into the mud , scum queen ! Aah ! You 'll never get a penny of that inheritance . First thing Monday , I 'm donating it to cranial research for the poor . By Monday , you 'll be dead ! Anne . Anne . Michael , who did you call a scum queen ? Oh ... Just some scum queen . I 'm frightened , Michael . I feel so strange . I feel the world slipping away . If only we could be together ... Really together . We can , darling . Oh , we can . Dr. Necessiter , I want to become a brain . What are you talking about ? I want you to build a tank for 2 . I want you to put me in with Anne uumellmahaye . Anne Uumellma-who ? Uumellmahaye . Brain 21 , to you . So , you 're the one who stole brain 21 . Where is it ? In the trunk of my car . I told her it was a box seat at the Vienna opera . Here are my instruments . Do I understand you correctly ? You want me to remove your brain and put it in a tank with number 21 ? Yes ! We can communicate . We 're in love . That 's the only way we can be together . Put me in a tank . There is an alternative . As you know , my research has advanced to a point where I can put her mind into the body of a gorilla . I couldn 't fuck a gorilla . Yes , I know , but there is one other alternative ... A human subject . Are you saying you can place her thoughts in another woman 's body ? In the past week , I 've had 2 near successes . What do you mean near successes ? In my recovery room are 2 subjects who do nothing but this ... But I think I 've solved the problem ! What kind of life would that be ? This is my wife . Oh , I know her . She 'd hate that . I 'd rather keep her in a jar . You wouldn 't have her there for long . What do you mean ? It 's a miracle she 's still alive . She 's outlived every brain I 've had . You 'll be lucky if she survives the weekend . All right . What do I have to do ? Wait . Wait for what ? For the elevator killer to strike again . Anne could be dead by then . I 'll check the hospital , the morgue ... Everywhere dead bodies hang out . I 'll get her a body . I 'll prepare the laboratory , and in case you 're not successful , I 'll have the gorilla wired and ready . I 'll get a body ! Will this do ? She just ... She just doesn 't have any ... Va-voom . She is dead , you know . Still ... You don 't like anything here ? No . Nothing really leaps out at me . Ooh . Action 's stiff . I can file down that sear pin . Let me have a box of dumdums .

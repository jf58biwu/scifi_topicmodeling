 A beginning is a very delicate time . Know then , that it is the year 10,191 . The known universe is ruled by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV , my father . In this time , the most precious substance in the universe is the spice , melange . The spice extends life . The spice expands consciousness . A product of the Spice ; The red Sapho juice stains the lips of the Mentats , but allows them to be human computers , as thinking machines have been outlawed . The spice is vital to space travel . The Spacing Guild and its navigators , who the spice has mutated over 4,000 years , use the orange spice gas , which gives them the ability to fold space . That is ; Travel to any part of the universe , without moving . Because the Guild controls all interplanetary travel , they are the highest power in the universe . The Spice also plays a very secret role in the Bene Gesserit sisterhood , of which I am part . The sisterhood has been interfering with the marriages , and with the children thereof , of the great Houses of the universe cleverly intermixing one bloodline with another to form the Kwisatz Haderach , a super being . They plan to control the super being and use his powers for their own selfish purposes . The breeding plan has been carried out in a strict manner for 90 generations . The goal of the super being is in sight . But now , so close to the prize , a Bene Gesserit woman ; Jessica , the bound concubine of Duke Leto Atreides who has been ordered to bear only daughters has given birth to a son . Oh , yes . I forgot to tell you . The spice exists on only one planet in the entire universe . A desolate , dry planet with vast deserts . Hidden away within the rocks of these deserts are a people known as the Fremen , who have long held a prophecy that a man would come , a messiah , who would lead them to true freedom . The planet is Arrakis , also known as Dune . A secret report within the Guild . Four planets have come to our attention regarding a plot which could jeopardize spice production . Planet Arrakis , source of the spice . Planet Caladan , home of House Atreides . Planet Giedi Prime , home of House Harkonnen . Planet Kaitain , home of the Emperor of the known universe . Send a third-stage Guild Navigator to Kaitain to demand details from the Emperor . The spice must flow . - Father ? - Irulan , you must leave . Why does the Guild send a third-stage Navigator here ? The Spice . It has to be . He senses my plan . My lord , the Reverend Mother is here . All entrance corridors and chambers have been cleared . We are dismissed ? Yes , yes , he 'll sense the least surveillance . No eavesdropping of any kind . A third-stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes . We felt his presence . I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we 're finished . Their minds are so ... - They move in strange directions . - Yes ? Forced spice evolution with humans changes many things . I must sit close to him . He will not permit anyone but me to see him . - You must be outside this room . - I am your Truthsayer , my lord . He 's here , my lord . [ " The Bene Gesserit witch must leave . " ] - Leave us . - Yes , my lord . We are alone . - We have just folded space from lx . - Yes ? How was your journey ? Many machines on lx . New machines . Oh ? Yes . Better than those on Richese . You are transparent . I see many things . I see plans within plans . Is there a problem ? Usually there 's a problem when one of you makes a visit . The answer is within the problem . I see two great houses , House Atreides , House Harkonnen , feuding . - I see you behind it . - Yes . You must share with us . The Atreides House is building a secret army using a technique unknown to us . A technique involving sound . The duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad . He could threaten me . I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice , thus replacing their enemies , the Harkonnens . House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain . Then , at an appointed time , Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides . I have promised the baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops . So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides . Yes ! Listen to me . The spice must flow . The spice has given me accelerated evolution for 4,000 years . It has enabled you to live 200 . It gives the Bene Gesserit sisterhoods the metaphysical ability to see beyond . You want superior powers . Our power to fold space is in the spice . Without us , your empire will be lost . On isolated scattered planets , you would be lost . One small point . ( Here it comes . ) We ourselves foresee a slight problem within House Atreides . Paul . Paul Atreides . You mean , of course , Duke Leto Atreides , his father . I mean Paul Atreides . We want him killed . I did not say this . I am not here . I understand . Well ? They fear that putting House Atreides on Arrakis will hurt spice production . For us , a small amount is enough to greatly extend our lives . But they consume tremendous quantities . A great deal is needed to evolve the seeing eye . They worry . The Universe worries when they worry . What else ? So much was unclear . You may go , Helen Mohiam ... Bene Gesserit . Yes , my lord . She 's Bene Gesserit . There 's nowhere in the Universe you can escape them . Her loyalty to the sisterhood is stronger than her loyalty to me . Watch her carefully . Why would they want the duke 's son killed ? We must have a look at Paul Atreides , on Caladan . On Caladan , because of her love for the duke , Jessica , the bound concubine of Duke Leto Atreides , gave birth to a son ... Paul ... Paul Atreides . Here we are now , Caladan . And 19 light-years beyond , beyond Bene Tleilax . The training planet of the Mentats , the human computers . Know a Mentat by his red-stained lips . ( There . Arrakis . ) Spice mining . Carryalls lower the harvester to the sand and lift it off to safety when a worm attacks . Worms attack all rhythmic vibrations . Weather . See storms . No precipitation . Never one drop of rain on Arrakis . And the Harkonnens are near . There . Giedi Prime and the Baron Harkonnen . The enemy . The Baron Harkonnen has sworn to destroy House Atreides and steal the ducal signet ring for himself . I know , Thufir . I 'm sitting with my back to the door . I heard you , Dr. Yueh , and Gurney coming down the hall . Those sounds could be imitated ! I 'd know the difference . ( Yes , perhaps you would at that . ) My father sent you to test me . Music , then ? No music . I 'm packing this for the crossing . - Shield practice . - Gurney , we had practice this morning . I 'm not in the mood . Not in the mood ! Mood 's a thing for cattle and love play , not fighting ! - I 'm sorry , Gurney . - Not sorry enough . ( What 's wrong with Gurney ? ) ( He 's not faking this . ) Now , guard yourself for true ! Is this what you seek ? Good . The slow blade penetrates the shield . But , uh , look down . We 'd have joined each other in death . You did seem finally to get the mood . Would you really have drawn my blood ? If you 'd have fought one whit below your abilities , I 'd have given you a good scar to remind you . Things have been so serious here lately . Soon we leave for Arrakis . Arrakis is real . The Harkonnens are real . Dr. Yueh , do you have any information on the worms of Arrakis ? I have obtained a filmbook of a small specimen , only 125 meters long . - Only ? - There have been documented sightings of worms as large as 450 meters in the deep desert . That 's far from where we 'll be in Arrakeen . The desert belt and the south polar region are marked forbidden . The storms and the worms . Is it true that the sand can blow at 700 km per hour ? It can render flesh into dust in minutes . And these dry winds can also generate tremendous amounts of static electricity in the atmosphere . Our body shields won 't have enough power to operate in the open air on Arrakis . - How do the Fremen survive there ? - We don 't know much about the Fremen . They live in the deep desert , some of them in the cities . - They have blue within blue eyes . - Oh , the eyes . Yes . The saturation of the blood by the spice , melange . - Could the spice affect us in other ways ? - Many dangers exist on Arrakis . For one , the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM Company contract so easily . The Harkonnens are our enemies , yes . But behind them , I suspect , is the Emperor . You 'll make a formidable duke . Now remember , the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence . I know . But if it is a trap , then why are we going ? We have our new army . Dr. Yueh , put the weirding module on him . Clear and lock the room ! Detachment , stand down ! Activate a fighter . Make the range two meters . Precise control . Duncan ! Paul . I was just on my way to say good-bye to you . I have to go on ahead alone . I won 't be seeing you for a while . I wish you were coming with us . Why ? Something for your father . He wants to talk to you . I 'll see you on Arrakis . May the hand of God be with you . May the hand of God be with us all , Duncan . - Father . - Thank you for joining me , Paul . It will be good to get to our new home and have all this upset behind us . Thufir Hawat has served House Atreides three generations . He swears you are the finest student he has ever taught . Yueh , Gurney and Duncan say the same . - It makes me feel very proud . - I want you to be proud of me . I 'll miss the sea . But a person needs new experiences . They jar something deep inside , allowing him to grow . Without change , something sleeps inside us and seldom awakens . The sleeper must awaken . Arrakis ... Dune ... desert planet ... I will kill you . The second moon ... Tell me of your home world , Usul . ( I know she has come to test him . ) ( No man has ever been ) ( tested with the box . ) ( Tonight , I may lose my son . ) Jessica , you were told to bear only daughters to the Atreides . Jessica ! It meant so much to him . You thought only of a duke 's desire for a son ? Desires don 't come into this . An Atreides daughter could have been wed to a Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach . We may lose both bloodlines now . I vowed never to regret my decision . I 'll pay for all my own mistakes . And your son will pay with you . Is Arrakis ... Is it really so terrible on Arrakis ? - My Duke ... - You entered into this with full knowledge of the delicate edge you walked . Jessica . Girl . I wish I could stand in your place and take your sufferings . But we must each of us take our own path . I know . I understand . About Paul ... What you did and why you did it , we both know . But kindness forces me to tell you there is little chance you will be the Bene Gesserit totality . However , I will observe him . In a few minutes , Jessica , your son will be proved to be a living human being or he will be a dead animal . He 's here . Arrakis ... Dune ... desert planet ... moving ... moving ... We 'll salvage what we can . But I can tell you , dear God ; For the father , nothing . ( For the father , nothing ? ) Did you really think you could bear the Kwisatz Haderach ? The universe 's super being ? How dare you ? My greatest student ... and my greatest disappointment . He 's awake . He 's listening to us . Good . Ready yourself , young Paul Atreides . I want to see you in your mother 's chambers in one quarter of an hour . Paul , this is very important . Remember you are a duke 's son . Vas . This is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam . She 's going to observe you . - Please . - Jessica , you know it must be done . Your Reverence . ( What does she fear ? ) What about my father ? Paul . Listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you . Now you ... come here ! ( She 's using the Voice . ) No . ( Some strength there . Surprising . ) Come here ! Do you see this ? - Put your right hand in the box . - What 's in the box ? Pain . Stop ! Put your hand in the box . I hold at your neck the gom jabbar . Don 't pull away or you 'll feel the poison . A duke 's son must know about many poisons . This one kills only animals . Are you suggesting a duke 's son is an animal ? Let us say , I suggest you may be human . Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts . Your instinct will be to remove your hand from the box . If you do so , you die . You will feel ... an itching . There . Now the itching becomes ... burning . Heat upon heat , upon heat ! - It burns . - Silence ! Silence ! ( I must not fear . ) ( Fear is the mind killer . ) ( Fear is the little death ) ( that brings total obliteration . ) ( I will face my fear . ) ( I will permit it to pass ) ( over me and through me . ) - ( I must not fear . ) - You feel the flesh crisping ? ( ... is the little death ) ( that brings total obliteration . ) Flesh ... dropping off . ( Fear is the little ... death ! ) ( I must not fear . ) ( Fear is the little death . ) ( I m - ) - The pain ! - No ! Enough . Kull wahad ! No woman child ever withstood that much . Take your hand out of the box and look at it , young human . Do it ! Pain by nerve induction . A human can resist any pain . - Our test is crisis and observation . - I see the truth of it . ( Could he be the one ? Maybe . ) ( But will he be ours to control ? ) - You know when people speak the truth ? - I know it . Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams . I only want to know one thing ; Do they come true ? Not all of them . I know which ones will . Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach . What is that ? The person who can be many places at once . The one who bridges time and space . He will look where we cannot . Do you know of the Water of Life ? The bile from the newborn worms of Arrakis ? - I have heard of it . - It is very dangerous . The Bene Gesserit sisterhood use it to see within . There is a place ... terrifying to us , to women . It is said a man will come , the Kwisatz Haderach . He will go where we cannot . Many men have tried . - They tried and failed ? - They tried and died . Jessica . ( My son lives . ) I sense your teachings in him . Ignore the regular order of training . - His safety requires the Voice . - I 've heard enough of my safety . What about my father ? I heard your talking . You speak as if he were dead . Well , he 's not ! - Paul . - But he 's not . And he won 't die . Tell me he won 't die . - What can be done has been done . - Mother , tell me ! The Voice could save you . Mentat Piter De Vries . Message for Mentat Piter De Vries . The Baron is impatient for Leto 's reply . It is by will alone I set my mind in motion . It is by the juice of Sapho that thoughts acquire speed , the lips acquire stains , the stains become a warning . It is by will alone I set my mind in motion . It is by will alone I set my mind in motion . It is by the juice of Sapho that thoughts acquire speed , the lips acquire stains , the stains become a warning . It is by will alone I set my mind in motion . - My lord . - Piter . The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon , Baron , and I have here your answer from Duke Leto . What does Leto say , Piter ? He wishes to inform you that " vendetta , " as he puts it , using the ancient tongue , the art of Kanly , is still alive . He does not wish to meet or speak with you . I 've made my peace gesture . The forms of Kanly have been obeyed ! Bring in Feyd and Rabban . As you instructed me , I have enlightened your nephews concerning my plan ... My plan ! The plan ; To crush the Atreides . Feyd . Rabban . Go quietly . No other great house of the Landsraad must ever know of the Emperor 's aid to the Baron . The entire Landsraad would turn against the Baron , and the Emperor . Put the pick in there , Pete , and turn it ' round real neat . You are so beautiful , my Baron . Your skin , love to me . Your diseases , lovingly cared for , for all eternity . I will have Arrakis back for myself . He who controls the spice controls the universe ! And what Piter did not tell you , is we have control of someone who is very close , very close to Duke Leto . This person , this traitor , will be worth more to us than ten legions of Sardaukar ! And who is this traitor ? I won 't tell you who the traitor is , or when we 'll attack . However , the duke will die before these eyes , and he 'll know , he 'll know that it is I , Baron Vladimir Harkonnen , who encompasses his doom ! ( This is what I 'll do ) ( to the duke and his family . ) I once told you a daughter would be conceived at a time of parting . I remember . Conceived in love at a time of parting . Arrakis is a hostile world . I must be sure you want this . It has to be tonight , under these influences . I could hear you with the wind . And I whispered yes . And I whispered , " I love you . " Soon they will begin to fold space . ( Far off in the control ) ( rooms of spice gas , ) ( traveling without moving . ) And now , the prophecy . One will come . The voice from the outer world , bringing the holy war , the jihad , which will cleanse the universe and bring us out of darkness . We know of CHOAM in the universe , controlled by the Emperor Shaddam IV , and all the great houses of the Landsraad . We know of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood , where a selective breeding plan for 90 generations produced the Kwisatz Haderach whom they will control . We know of the Guild and the Navigators power to fold space , and their control over all interplanetary travel . We know they have the seeing eye . The Bakka shall weep no more , for there is now at work , a higher power . We are the secret . The mother and the son . House Atreides took control of Arrakis , 63 standard days into the year 10,191 . It was known that the Harkonnens , the former rulers of Arrakis , would leave many suicide troops behind . Atreides patrols were doubled . My lord . My lord ? Thufir ? Haven 't you heard from Duncan Idaho yet ? No , sire . I have however discovered what the city Fremen called out to Paul when we entered the city . Mahdi [ " he who is rightly guided " ] and ... Lisan al-Gaib [ " voice from the outer world " ] yes . It is a prophecy , that a young leader will come to them with a Bene Gesserit mother . It follows the familiar Messiah pattern . - But ... Mahdi ? - Yes . It seems , it is written that he will lead them , to true ... freedom . Duncan . The Fremen have sent a message to you , sire . - Have you read this ? - No , I was instructed it was for you . It says ; " A column of smoke by day , a pillar of fire by night . " - A warning . - An obscure one , at best . What have you discovered about the Fremen , Duncan ? Tell me . Why haven 't we heard from you ? My lord , I suspect so much . I think they are the allies we seek . They are strong , fierce . They do not give their loyalty easily or quickly . As you know , the Imperium has never been able to take a census of the Fremen . Everyone thinks that there are but few wandering here and there in the desert . My lord , I suspect an incredible secret has been kept on this planet , that the Fremen exist in vast numbers , vast ... and it is they who control Arrakis . Each trooper will be charged with responsibility for preserving water . Our existence as an operating army depends on these following water-saving procedures . Remember , water is life . Why is the shield not yet up ? Sir , we found and removed another sabotage device . I think it 'll go up now , sir . Armed forces prospects for rehabilitation are good . We 're finding these sabotage devices too easily . House shield activating . My lady , the local people , the maids and servants , await your inspection . Hawat has cleared them . Excuse me , my lady . The Harkonnens may have tampered with them medically . When you said Harkonnens ... I didn 't know you had so much reason to hate them . Well , my wife ... But , of course , you didn 't know my wife . - The Har ... - Forgive me . ( They must have killed her . ) Please excuse me if I can 't talk about it . ( He 's holding something back . ) ( Yet ... there 's the ) ( Imperial conditioning . ) ( Assurance of trust . ) ( The Bene Gesserit mother , the legend . ) ( Where is your son ? ) ( I must warn you . ) ( You are in great danger . ) ( My message , it 's here . ) There are more enemy bodies coming in for your inspection , Doctor Yueh . Are you all right ? Yes , I 'm fine . Thank you , Thufir . Safe . ( Spice . ) ( What is it doing to me ? ) ( The second moon . ) The sleeper must awaken . ( Am I the one ? ) ( A hunter-seeker ! ) ( It can 't get me if I don 't move . ) ( It 's too dark in here ) ( for it to see clearly . ) ( I 've got to try to grab it . ) ( The suspensor field will make ) ( it slippery on the bottom . ) ( I must grip it tightly . ) ( Who is operating that thing ? ) ( It has to be someone in the palace . ) ( I could shout for help , but it would ) ( kill whoever opened the door . ) ( Hold still . ) It would have killed me . I was its target . It went to the motion . Who are you ? I am the Shadout Mapes , the housekeeper . I must cleanse the way between us . You saved my life , and we Fremen pay our debts . ( A Fremen ! ) It is known to us that you 've a traitor in your midst . Who it is , we cannot say . But we are certain of it . ( A traitor . ) Set up a sonar probe immediately ! Thufir , did you find anything ? Nothing yet . Keep looking . ( And the traitor ? God help us . ) My lord ... again , my lord , I wish to tender my resignation ... Silence , Thufir ! Stop acting the fool ! I told you yesterday . If you made a mistake , it was in overestimating the Harkonnens . Their simple minds came up with a simple trick . Paul survived this largely because of your training . You didn 't fail there . Sit down , Thufir . My lord . Thufir , where is this traitor ? I know you 've cleared everyone , especially those close to us . But recheck and find him . ( They have tried to ) ( take the life of my son . ) Sector 6 through 80 progress reports , sire . Take it , Thufir . Sector 680 , copy the 6th , the summit , the 8th , quadrant over the 9th plus 84 circles , weave the 80 and call the 4th . Copy . 8 . Thufir Hawat , Mentat , Master of assassins . The palace is now secure . The city of Arrakeen is under martial law . We have troops here headquartered underground on sub-floors 6 through 10 . The rest of the troops are stationed in Arrakeen and we have some on the airfield . Our new army is still in training , but everything , everything is shielded . And with this shielding we are impenetrable . Kynes ... Kynes ... Dr. Kynes is waiting . He is the Emperor 's Judge of the Change , monitoring the evacuation of the Harkonnens and our taking control . He plans on taking you on an inspection of the spice mining operation . Now , he may or may not be sympathetic to our cause . But , sire ... with the attempt on the young master , - I am against your leaving the palace ! - The attempt failed ! Harkonnen captives have already been taken ! We must crush the Harkonnen machine on Arrakis ! You all know what to do ! Gurney , we desperately need more spice miners . Many are threatening to leave on the next shuttle . We need spice drivers , weather scanners , dunemen . Any with open sand experience . You must persuade them to enlist with us ! " They shall come all for violence . " " Their faces shall sup up as the east wind . " " And they will gather the captivity of the sand . " Very moving , Gurney . On your way . And take care of Doctor Kynes until Paul and I arrive . We will not be prisoners here in this place . Behold , as a wild ass in the desert go I forth to my work . Yes ? I am the Shadout Mapes . Your housekeeper , noble-born . What are your orders ? You may refer to me as ' my lady ' . I 'm not noble-born . I 'm the bound concubine of Duke Leto , mother of the heir designate . " Shadout . " [ " Well-dipper " ] That 's an ancient word . - You know the ancient tongues ? - I know many things . I know you came prepared for violence with a weapon in your bodice . My lady , the weapon was sent as a gift , if you should prove to be the one . And the means of my death , should I prove otherwise . - Do you know this , my lady ? - It 's a krysknife . Say it not lightly . Do you know its meaning ? It 's a maker . Did you think that I wouldn 't know the maker ? My lady , when one has lived with prophecy for so long , the moment of revelation is a shock . Mapes , you 've sheathed that blade unbloodied . Take the water of my life ! You are ours ... you are the one . Duke Leto is now here . Spice mining inspection to start immediately . So you are Dr. Kynes , the Judge of the change . - And the Imperial Ecologist , sire . - Our intelligence informs us , that there 's still a strong Harkonnen presence . The process of removal continues . This is my son , Paul . - Are you a Fremen ? - I 've been on Arrakis ... in the service of the Emperor long enough for my eyes to change . ( In the service of the Emperor . ) We are in your hands , Doctor . Your gift of the stillsuits is much appreciated . Would you give us an explanation of their workings ? Well , this is a stillsuit of Fremen manufacture , the most efficient type on Arrakis . Basically ... - It 's all right , Gurney . - Yes , sire . Basically , it 's a high efficiency filter and heat exchange system . Perspiration passes through the first layer , and is gathered in the second , where salt is separated . Breathing and walking provide the pumping action . The reclaimed water circulates to catch pockets from which you can drink through this tube , at your neck . Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads . Should you be in the open desert , remember to breathe in through your mouth , and out through this nose tube . With a Fremen suit in good working condition , life can be sustained for weeks , even in the deep desert , sire . - My thanks . - With your permission . - You 've worn a stillsuit before . - No . Your suit is fitted desert fashion . - Who told you how to do that ? - No one . It seemed the proper way . That it is . ( He shall know your ) ( ways as if born to them . ) We 're wasting time , sire . Airspeed : 0-5 . Ambient temperature : 300 degrees kelvin . Airspeed : 3-0 . Ether bender : 35 % efficiency . That 's where I told your sandmaster to concentrate the harvesting today . Southeast , over the shield wall . Ambient temperature : 350 degrees kelvin . Airspeed : 1-3-0 . Caution : You 've now cleared protective shield wall and entered open desert . Will we see a worm ? Where there 's spice and spice mining , there are always worms . - Always ? - Always . Why do they come ? To protect their territory . Vibrations attract them . ( He must be a Fremen , or in ) ( with them . He 's studying us . ) ( He 's hiding something about the spice . ) Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice ? As I said , they defend the spice sand . As to their relationship with the spice ... who knows ? - Dust cloud ahead , sire . - That 's it . Spice mining . No other cloud quite like it . See the spotters over it ? They 're watching for wormsign , the telltale sand waves . Seismic probes on the surface too , sire . Worms can travel too deep for their waves to show . Looks like a good patch of spice . Wormsign . Is it wormsign ? Yes . Worm . Big one . You 've got sharp eyes . May I ? Calling Harvester Pad Nine . Wormsign . Who calls Pad Nine ? Don 't mention the duke . This is an uncoded channel . Unlisted flight northeast of you . Wormsign on intercept course . Estimated contact : 15 minutes . Have sighting confirmed . Stand by for fix ... contact in 16 minutes minus . Very precise estimate . Who 's on that unlisted flight ? What happens now ? The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester . Try to get in close over the harvester . You 'll find this interesting , sire . They 'll work until the very last minute . Spotter control , there 's no sign of the carryall . It isn 't answering . The worm is eight minutes away , sire . Spotter control , give me a report by the numbers . - Report One . - No contact . - Report Two . - Negative . - Report Three . - Negative , sir . - Report Four . - No contact , repeat , no contact . - I think they 've got our carryall . - Damn it ! Harkonnens ! We are coming down to take you off the harvester . All spotters are ordered to comply . - Ordered by whom ? - Duke Leto Atreides . - Yes . Yes , sire . - How many men do you have ? Full crew , 26 men . But , sire , we can 't leave all this spice . Damn the spice ! Get out of there ! Two men in each of the spotters ! You , over here ! Run ! Run ! I can 't see him yet , but he 's very close now . - Damn sloppy . Really damn sloppy . - Come on , boys , come on ! We 're going to be heavy , sire . ( Spice ... pure , unrefined spice . ) Here it is ! We 've got to go ! Bless the maker and his water . Bless the coming and going of him . - May his passing cleanse the world . - What 's that you 're saying ? Nothing . Gods , what a monster ! Someone is going to pay for this , I promise . ( He 's more concerned ) ( over his men than the spice . ) ( I must admit , against all ) ( better judgment , I like this duke . ) Dr. Kynes , being in the employ of the Emperor , as you are , perhaps it isn 't wise for you to associate too closely with us Atreides . On the contrary , I feel very comfortable here . Remember how precious water is here . It was a token of respect . Are you enlisting with us ? You see through to the truth of the thing , sire . That means a dual alliance . He 's in with the Emperor . A dual alliance , yes ... but not with the Emperor . The Fremen ! Then let water be a bond between us . Sorry you have to sleep so far underground , but we can 't take any chances . - I see you 're studying . - Knowledge is strength . Yes , so said Thufir Hawat . One must have more than that to hold Arrakis against our many enemies . Much more . Much ... more . Paul ... - if anything should happen to me ... - Father , nothing 's going to happen . Yes . But if it should , I ... Yes ? Unknown objects on screen . We are attempting to identify . I 'll be back , son . Sleep well , my son . Fa ... father ... drugged ... ( Jessica , what is wrong ? ) ( Forgive me , my beloved concubine . ) ( I should have married you . ) ( Why hold a dream to ascend to a throne ) ( through a political marriage ? ) ( I should have married you . ) What happened ? Yueh ! ( He sabotaged the house ) ( generators . We are wide open ! ) House shield deactivating . I 've destroyed the new army 's weirding modules . I 've brought House Atreides down . - Why ? - I wish to kill a man . Not you , my dear Duke . You are already dead . But you 'll get close to the baron before you die . You 'll be tied and drugged , but you can still attack . You can still attack ! When you see the baron , you 'll have a new poison gas tooth . He 'll want you close so he can gloat over you . One bite on this tooth , and a strong exhale ... - Refuse . - No , you mustn 't ! Because , in return , I 'll save the lives of your Paul and Jessica . For Paul ! When you see the baron , remember the tooth . The tooth . The tooth ! Attention ! Attention ! We are approaching target area . We are approaching target area . The bomb scopes are set . The shield is down ! The shield is down ! Open the doors ! Signals ! Get that shield up ! The shield ! Man the planes . Man the planes . Release the bombs . Release the bombs . Long live Duke Leto ! The drug was timed . Dr. Yueh has been very valuable to us . What a pity you must remain gagged . We can 't let ourselves be swayed by your witch 's voice now , can we ? ( Leto , where are you ? ) Bring him here ! You 've done a very good job . He hardly feels a thing . Open your mouth . Open it , open it ! You 've done a good job , traitor . They are alike , this mother and son . ( Paul ! ) Dangerous . The training they have had ... beyond most people 's imaginations . ( Leto . ) They 're in your hands , Piter . Good-bye , Jessica . And good-bye to your sweet son . I want to spit , once , on your head . Just some spittle in your face . What a luxury . We were ordered to kill them , so kill them . What are your orders , Piter ? Take them to the desert as the traitor suggested . The worms will destroy the evidence . Their bodies must never be found . I knew Yueh 's wife . I was the one who broke his Imperial conditioning . I 've thought of many pleasures with you . It is perhaps better that you die in the innards of a worm . Desire clouds my reason . That is not good . That is bad . They 're down on this floor somewhere . Down there . Duncan ! Back ! Keep him back from me ! You wish now to join your wife ? Is that it , traitor ? - She lives ! ? - You wish to join her ? Join her . You think you 've defeated me ? You think I don 't know what I gained ... for my wife ? Take him away . Guards ! Where are they ? - They 're over the great desert . - Continue reconnaissance . ( Yueh 's sign . ) ( He 's left us stillsuits . ) Don 't touch my mother ! ( He 's trying the Voice . ) ( The Reverend Mother ) ( said it could save him . ) Did you hear a noise from the little one ? I didn 't hear anything . The little one . Remove her gag . ( Excellent . ) There 's no need to fight over me . ( A poisoned blade . ) First ... cut my son 's bonds . That 's it . Oh , my God ! ( It 's under control . ) Duke Leto Atreides . Someone 's torn the insignia off your uniform . Such carelessness . It was Feyd . It was Feyd ? The sweet ... Feyd ... Duke Leto Atreides . Where is the ducal signet ring ? I must have his ring . The ring ! He was brought to us as is , my lord Baron . You killed the doctor too soon , you fool ! ( The doctor , Yueh . What did he say ? ) ( Paul and Jessica safe . ) ( Yes ! The tooth ! ) - He 's coming around , Baron . - Where 's your ring ? Huh ? You do not answer ? ( Wait . Wait . ) ( You must come closer . ) The water ... of my life ... for Paul . He 's crying . He 's crying ! What does that mean , Piter ? ( Come closer , Baron . ) ( Jessica ! Paul ! ) Leto ! Leto , he 's dead ! Oh , he 's dead ! I know . Am I alive ? - I 'm alive ? - Yes . You 're alive , my Baron . I 'm alive , eh ? I 'm alive ! I am alive ! I 'm alive ! I can 't maintain any altitude . We 'll never reach the safety of rock . Maybe that small rock . Where are we , do you think ? The south polar regions . The forbidden area . Hold on . Hurry ! Take the stillsuits . Hurry ! This crash might bring a worm . The signet . A million deaths are not enough for Yueh ! ( Where are my feelings ? ) ( I feel for no one . ) ( The second moon . ) I mean Paul Atreides . We want him killed . ( Why ? Why do they want me killed ? ) ( It has to be something to do ) ( with the spice . But what ? ) He who controls the spice controls the universe ! ( This moon holds my future . ) ( Never one drop of rain on Arrakis . ) The sleeper must awaken . ( They will call me Muad 'Dib . ) Listen to me . Listen . You wanted to know about my dreams . Well , I 've just had a waking dream . Do you know why ? The spice ! It 's in everything here . Calm yourself . Like the Truthsayer drug . It 's a poison . You knew the spice would change me . But thanks to your teachings , it 's changing my consciousness . - I see it ! I can see it ! - ( Is he the one ? ) - You carry my unborn sister in your womb . - ( He knows . ) You ... and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood ... I 'm not your Kwisatz Haderach ! I 'm something different , something unexpected ... I 'm so much more ... You don 't begin to know me . I curse the day you awakened what I am ! Father ! ( Father , I promise one day ) ( the sleeper will awaken , ) ( and I will avenge your death . ) ( I will not stop until I destroy ) ( the emperor and the baron . ) Father . Go now . Take him to his desert ... to die . Go . ( Yueh 's left the plan ) ( for the weirding modules . ) We have to get to that mountain of rock . We have entered the time when all will turn against us and seek our lives . It 's further than I thought . A worm is sure to come . I 'll plant this thumper . That should divert it . Remember , walk without rhythm , and we won 't attract a worm . It will go to the thumper . I 'm ready . Faster ! It 's deafening ! ( The spice . ) - Do you smell it ? - Yes ! Paul ! Paul ! ( A thumper . ) ( The worm ! Spice ! ) ( Is there a relationship ? ) What 's happened ? Why did it leave ? Someone started another thumper . We 're not alone . - Man-carved steps . - Yes . ( Such stealth ! I didn 't hear them . ) Perhaps these are the ones the Shadout Mapes told us of . I will take the boy-man . He shall have sanctuary in my tribe . Stop ! Get back ! She has the weirding way . Great gods ! If you can do this to the strongest of us , you 're worth 10 times your weight of water . As the leader of my people , I give you my bond . Teach us this weirding way , and you both shall have sanctuary . - Your water shall mingle with our water . - Then I will teach you our way of battle . I give you the word bond of a Bene Gesserit . It is the legend . I am Chani , daughter of Liet . I would not have permitted you to harm my tribe . ( From my dreams . So beautiful . ) Come with me . I 'll show you an easier way down . He surprised me . It was an accident ! Stilgar , I invoke the Amtal rule ! Jamis , you force this fight . These people have my countenance . If you should win , I will cut you down . Jamis , I don 't want to fight you . Maybe if I explain ... Explain ? Explain death ! I am going to sheath my knife in your blood . No shields ... I 'm used to shield fighting . Take my crysknife . Jamis turns to the right with his knife after a parry . And watch for a knife switch . May thy knife chip and shatter . You have strength . You shall be known as Usul , which is the strength of the base of the pillar . This is your secret name in our troop , but you must choose the name of manhood , which we will call you openly . What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon ? - We call that one Muad 'Dib . - Could I be known as Paul Muad 'Dib ? You are Paul Muad 'Dib , and your mother shall be a Sayyadina among us . We welcome you . ( A dream unfolds . ) And now ... the prophecy . One will come . The voice from the outer world . Bringing the Holy War , the Jihad , which will cleanse the Universe and bring us out of darkness . The wife and sons of Jamis . This water belongs to Usul . May he guard it for the tribe . May he be generous with it in times of need . Jamis carried 33 liters and 7 and 3 thirty seconds drachmas . Do you accept them ? Yes . Water masters ! - Moisture ! - Wind traps . Huge ones . ( Water . Millions of decaliters . ) - A treasure . - Greater than treasure , Usul . We have thousands of such caches , and only a few of us know them all . And when we have enough , we shall change the face of Arrakis . Tell me of your home world , Usul . ( " Tell me of your home world , Usul . " ) What is it ? Liet , Chant 's father , the leader of our people , is dead . Killed by the Harkonnen . ( For the father , nothing . ) Both of us have lost our fathers . Rabban ! Rabban ! We 're knee-deep in Atreides blood . We 've gutted them ! We 've gutted them ! Rabban ! Rabban ! I place you in charge of Arrakis . It 's yours to squeeze as I promised . I want you to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze ! Give me spice ! Drive them ! Drive them into utter submission ! Do not show the slightest pity or mercy ! - Never stop ! Go ! Go ! Show no mercy ! - Yes , Baron ! Feyd . And when we 've crushed these people enough , I 'll send you , Feyd . Lovely Feyd . Where 's my doctor ! ? Do you know the Water of Life ? Come watch , the mystery of mysteries . The end , and the beginning . The Water of Life . The Water of Life . Jessica ... our Reverend Mother is too old . She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest . She asks that you pass within and become our Reverend Mother . If you be a Reverend Mother ... let Shai-Halud judge now ! ( The Water of Life . ) ( But what of my unborn child ? ) ( One day , I will have to do this . ) Following the Bene Gesserit tradition , the old Reverend Mother surrendered her life , as she surrendered her knowledge . Jessica had successfully transmuted the poisonous Water of Life . ( Every man who has tried , ) ( has died . Am I the one ? ) The sleeper must awaken . The tremendous power of the Water of Life caused the premature birth of Jessica 's daughter , Alia . Alia was born with all the knowledge and powers of a Reverend Mother . Feyd , even though he 's aging ; Thufir 's one of the finest Mentats in the universe . And he 's mine , Feyd , all mine . - Quiet now . - I will . Come . Oh , Thufir ! I see they 've installed your heart plug already . Don 't be angry . Everyone gets one here . But this is not why we 're here . We brought you a little cat , Thufir . You must care for it if you wish to live . A poison has been introduced into your body , Thufir Hawat . By milking this , this smooth little cat 's body , you receive your antidote . It must be done each day . All I can see ... is an Atreides that I want to kill . Feyd ! No , no ! Thufir 's a Harkonnen now . Aren 't you , Thufir ? ( My duke ! How I 've failed you . ) ( Chani , I love you . ) ( I 've always loved you . ) ( The Holy Warriors . ) ( No one ever dreamed ) ( there were so many . ) I am Usul ... Paul Muad 'Dib . Our shared enemy , the Harkonnens , are once again in control of Arrakis . Stilgar , your leader , has asked me and my mother to teach you the weirding way to crush the Harkonnens . We must do more than this . We must totally destroy all spice production on Arrakis . The Guild and the entire universe depends on spice . He who can destroy a thing controls a thing . I will take 100 of your warriors and train them . This 100 will train the thousands that remain . When the spice flow stops , all eyes will turn to Arrakis . The baron and the emperor himself will be forced to deal with us . Arrakis will become the center of the universe . Orato ! This obelisk is of your hardest stone . Kick it . Hit it . Yell at it . Break ! Korba ... cut it . Move back . Cha-a-a-a ... a-aksa ! Achiii ! This is part of the weirding way that we will teach you . Some thoughts have a certain sound , that being the equivalent to a form . Through sound and motion , you will be able to paralyze nerves , shatter bones , set fires , suffocate an enemy or burst his organs . We will kill until no Harkonnen breathes Arrakeen air . Muad 'Dib ! Cha-a-a-a-aksa ! Stilgar ! - Muad 'Dib ! - Hmm ? Muad 'Dib . Muad 'Dib . Muad 'Dib . ( My name is a killing word . ) ( They are ready to fight . ) ( Yet in order to lead them , I must ) ( conquer the worm . Conquer Shai-Halud . ) Usul , it is time you become a sand rider and travel as a Fremen . Take the kiswa maker hook of our sietch , and ride as a leader of men . Two thumpers are planted . The worm may not surface for the first . He will rise for the second . And remember , when the worm approaches , you must be utterly still and close enough to plant the hook firmly under a ring segment . The worm will turn to lift this exposed area as far from the abrasive sand as possible , and it will take you with it to the top . Do not get too close . As he approaches , the sand will engulf you . Wait till the head of the worm passes , then go , quickly . Mmmmmm . Shai-Halud . ( I must not fear . ) ( Fear is the mind killer . ) Only the very strong ones travel this deep . Usul has called a big one ! Again , it is the legend . Look ! Usul , these are 15 of our finest warriors , to serve you as your guard . The Fedaykin . Now . ( When the spice flow stops , ) ( all eyes will turn to Arrakis . ) ( The baron and the emperor himself ) ( will be forced to deal with us . ) Muad 'Dib . Muad 'Dib . Muad 'Dib . Muad 'Dib . What happened ? What happened to you and your men ? - Muad 'Dib . Muad 'Dib . - What are you saying ? - Muad 'Dib . Muad 'Dib . Muad 'Dib . - What ? He 's been repeating that name ever since we found him . Who is this ... Muad 'Dib ? In the two standard years that followed , Muad 'Dib and the Fremen brought spice production to a standstill . Fearing for his life , Rabban did his best to hide this fact from his uncle , the baron . Paul 's sister , Alia , matured at a frightening rate . Her small body harbored tremendous powers . Paul and Chant 's love grew . - We surprised a band of smugglers . - Too bad ! I thought they were Harkonnen . Gurney ! ? You 've no need of your weapons with me , Gurney Halleck . Paul ! ? Paul ? - Don 't you trust your own eyes ? - They said you were dead . They ... they said ... - Gurney man ! - You young pup ! You young pup ! [ " Emperor Shaddam IV , " ] [ " You have one last chance " ] [ " to take matters into your own hands " ] [ " And bring the situation " ] [ " under control on Arrakis . " ] - What do you mean one last ... - [ " Silence ! Do not speak ! Listen ! " ] [ " You do not have more " ] [ " than this one chance . " ] [ " I represent the entire " ] [ " Guild in this matter . " ] [ " Our navigators warn you that " ] [ " spice production is in great danger . " ] [ " A new Fremen leader , Muad 'Dib , " ] [ " has stopped spice mining on Arrakis . " ] [ " Our navigators suggest " ] [ " he is not of Arrakis . " ] [ " No one on the outside world " ] [ " has been able to see him . " ] [ " We do not know who he is . " ] [ " The Harkonnens cannot stop him . " ] [ " Remedy the situation , " ] [ " restore spice production , " ] [ " Or you 'll live out your life " ] [ " in a pain amplifier . " ] [ " The emperor will stop him . " ] [ " He won 't take the Water of Life . " ] ( That 's why they want me killed . They 're ) ( afraid I 'll take the Water of Life . ) I want 50 legions of Sardaukar on Arrakis at once ! Fifty legions ? That 's our entire reserves as well . This is genocide ; The deliberate and systematic destruction of all life on Arrakis ! ( The emperor is coming . Chani ! Chani ! ) You were calling my name . It frightened me . Oh , Chani . All the images of my future are gone . - I have to drink the Water of Life . - No . Paul . Please . I 've seen the men who have tried . I 've seen how they died . I 'm dead to everyone unless I try to become what I may be . Only the Water of Life will free what can save us . Paul . I must drink the sacred water . We must go now . - Hurry . All I see is darkness . - Paul ... I will love you forever . You are my life . You are my life . Many men have tried . - They tried and failed ? - They tried and died . The worm is the spice . The spice is the worm . The worms ... ( They 're not attacking . Why ? ) - Alia . - Mother . It 's Paul . He 's taken the Water of Life . There is a place ... terrifying to us , to women . This is the place they cannot look . Travelling without moving . Now I truly control the worm , and the spice . And I have the power to destroy the spice forever ! Paul . Father ! Father , the sleeper has awakened ! Muad 'Dib ... Muad 'Dib ... Muad 'Dib ... Arrakis . Dune . Desert planet . Your time has come . A storm is coming . Our storm . And when it arrives it will shake the universe . Emperor , we come for you ! We come for you ! Long live the fighters ! Long live the fighters ! Suspicion confirmed : The emperor 's had Rabban seized . Stand by the main control room . Gurney , when the storm hits , set off the atomics . I want an opening through the entire shield wall . Stilgar , do we have wormsign ? Usul , we have wormsign the likes of which even God has never seen . Bring in that floating fat man , the baron . Why have you brought me here ? Your Highness ... there must be some mistake . - I never requested your presence . - Ah . But your lack of action demanded it . Your dreadful mismanagement , your bad judgment in assigning to Rabban the governorship . You 've forced me to come here and set things straight , personally ! And why did you not tell me of the fighting ability of these people ? We 've just flushed out a nest of them in the open desert and the women and children overpowered some of our Sardaukar . We managed only one hostage . Bring in the hostage ! Only one . I am a messenger from Muad 'Dib . Poor Emperor . I 'm afraid my brother won 't be very pleased with you . Silence ! Kill this child , she 's an abomination . Kill her ! Get out of my mind ! Not until you tell them both who I really am . Alia ... Daughter of Duke Leto the Just , and the Royal Lady Jessica . Sister of Paul Muad 'Dib . Paul 's sister ? Paul is Muad 'Dib ! ? Alia keeps pace with the storm . ( With the storm , ) ( their air power will be useless . ) ( On Arrakis , it 's desert power . ) - Gurney ... now ! - Atomics ! Our army awaits us . My brother is coming with many Fremen warriors . - Impossible ! - Not impossible ! I told you . He is here now . ( Father , today I will ) ( avenge your death . ) Emperor , an impassable storm has descended . The shield wall has been penetrated by atomics . Release the Sardaukar ! Baron , give this little abomination to the storm . ( Wait for my brother , Baron . ) ( Wait for my brother . ) - ( Alia , now . ) - ( Come to me , Baron . ) Muad 'Dib . ( They 've taken your mind ... ) Gurney , I see Thufir Hawat among the captives . Let him stand free . The antidote ! Thufir ... come . ( A knife . ) In payment of the many years of service to my family , you may now ask of me anything you wish . Anything at all . Do you need my life , old friend ? It is yours . I mean this , Thufir . If you are to strike , do it now . Three generations ... of you ... Carry this noble Atreides warrior away . Do him all honor . Emperor Shaddam IV , there are Guild Highliners above us containing many great Houses of the Landsraad . Send them back ! - How dare you speak to me in that ... - Stop your speaking ! You have some idea of what I could do . Don 't try your powers on me . Try looking into that place where you dare not look . You 'll find me there staring back at you . - You mustn 't speak ... - Silence ! I remember your gom jabbar . Now you 'll remember mine . I can kill with a word . And his word shall carry death eternal ... to those who stand against the righteous . - The righteous ? - There is a Harkonnen among you . Give the Harkonnen a blade , and let him stand forth . If Feyd wishes , he can meet you with my blade in his hand . - I wish it . - This is a Harkonnen animal . - Let me . Please , my lord . - The Emperor 's blade . Why prolong the inevitable ? I will kill you ! I will kill him ! Paul ! I will kill him ! Who is the little one ? A pet , perhaps ? Will she deserve my special attentions ? ( Poisoned . ) You see your death . My blade will finish you . ( I will bend like a reed in the wind . ) Cha-aksa ! Muad 'Dib ! Usul no longer needs the weirding module . Irulan shall be my wife , opening the way for an Atreides to take the throne . I sit on the throne ! You will sit on a throne on Salusa Secundus , your prison planet ! Either that , or you will die . The Princess shall have no more of me than my name . No child of mine or touch nor softness of glance , nor instant of desire . This is my promise to you . Think of it , Chani . We who carry the name of concubine , history will call us ' wives ' . Muad 'Dib had become the hand of God , fulfilling the Fremen prophecy . Where there was war , Muad 'Dib would now bring peace . Where there was hatred , Muad 'Dib would bring love , to lead the people to true freedom , and to change the face of Arrakis . We Fremen have a saying . God created Arrakis to train the faithful . One cannot go against the word of God . And how can this be ? For he is the Kwisatz Haderach !

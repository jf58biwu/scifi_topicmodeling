 And to another fine year of trading . Hear , hear ! Truly , the medical supplies you have given to us over the past several years have made an immeasurable difference to our people . Not to mention your warning last harvest that the Wraith were nearby . You saved many lives . Well , you know . My favorite missions are { : } to do our trading . { \ : n } when we come here to do our trading . And I 've said that , I can prove it . { : } I 'm not just saying ... { \ : n } I 'm not just saying that ... You don 't need to prove it . You know , actually , we got to get going . So soon ? - Yeah , so soon ? - We were hoping that you could stay ... Well , I ... I guess we could stay a little longer . I hate to ... no , never mind . - What is it ? - Well , I wouldn 't dream of imposing ... you 've been so generous to our people already ... - What 's the problem ? - Our sister . She is in great need of your help . - { : } I didn 't even know you had a sister . { \ : n } I didn 't even know you gals had a sister . - We do indeed . And I imagine she 's as beautiful as you two . Even more so . - And she 's in great need of guidance . - Guidance . That I can do . You are most generous . Excuse us for one moment . I 'll get her . - Dibs . - What ? - I 'm calling dibs on the third sister . - You can 't call dibs . Look , we both know that Flora and Mardola have been suckered in by the whole cliche-heroic thing you 've got going , but maybe this other sister , maybe her taste in men will run more to the ... Geeky ? I was going to say " cerebral , " but who knows . Maybe we 'll hit it off . I don 't need your love life screwing up our trade relations . I 'll try not to break her heart , but no promises . These are the men I was telling you about . Gentlemen , this is our sister ... Harmony . Super . { \ pos ( 192,225 ) } Teams { \ pos ( 300,140 ) } SG-66 { \ pos ( 192,30 ) } The { \ pos ( 95,140 ) } Projet-SG { \ pos ( 40,152 ) } present : Season 4 Episode 14 Harmony ( v. 1.0 ) { \ pos ( 130,255 ) } Transcription by : { \ pos ( 300,260 ) } Timing by : { \ pos ( 135,260 } Golgi , Linwelin , Obusco , Ricana . Cos $ As you know , our mother and queen passed at the beginning of this lunar cycle . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } A secret , sacred ceremony was held { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } to determine which of her three daughters would succeed her . { \ pos ( 192,180 ) } It was determined that Harmony shall be the new queen . { \ pos ( 192,180 ) } Really ? Well , congrats . Before she is crowned , { \ pos ( 192,200 ) } all future queens must perform a time-honored rite of passage . A rite of passage normally performed alone . It is not written one way or another . And Harmony is so young . - It concerns me greatly . - I can do it . { \ pos ( 192,200 ) } You are very brave ... { \ pos ( 192,200 ) } but the trail is difficult . { \ pos ( 192,200 ) } It would bring me great comfort to know { \ pos ( 192,200 ) } that you had someone looking out for you . { \ pos ( 192,200 ) } What kind of rite of passage are we talking about here ? { \ pos ( 192,200 ) } Deep in the forest lies the ruins of the great temple of Laros . { \ pos ( 192,200 ) } Every queen must take a pilgrimage before the end of the first lunar cycle { \ pos ( 192,200 ) } of their selection . { \ pos ( 192,200 ) } Once there , she must meditate on the journey that lies ahead of her { \ pos ( 192,200 ) } and pray to be endowed with the knowledge and power { \ pos ( 192,200 ) } to govern her people . How deep in the forest ? No more than a day 's trek . I see . { \ pos ( 192,200 ) } Yes . No . { \ pos ( 192,200 ) } We are very honored , { \ pos ( 192,200 ) } but why don 't you just have a couple of your own guards escort her ? { \ pos ( 192,180 ) } Although it is not written so , our people will expect their new queen { \ pos ( 192,180 ) } to have completed the journey on her own . { \ pos ( 192,200 ) } So you don 't want her to be alone , but you don 't want anyone to know - she 's getting help . - Precisely . Right . We 'd love to lend a hand , but ... Our peoples have enjoyed such a fruitful alliance . Yeah ... One that has greatly benefited both parties . Right ... I 'd hate to think that one of us would put that in jeopardy over a simple day 's walk in the forest . When do we leave ? I must confess ... I 'm quite looking forward to this . I rarely get to leave the confines of the castle , although I 've had much training in forest survival . { \ pos ( 192,200 ) } Oh , you have , have you ? { \ pos ( 192,200 ) } Oh , yes . { \ pos ( 192,200 ) } I have completed three sessions with Nolar Lumsbred . He is one of the greatest hunters amongst my people . Three whole sessions ? With the Nolar Lumsbred ? They were all I needed . I am a quick learner . I 'll bet you are . Tell me , which one of you is the superior officer ? You mean who outranks who ? Yes . I 'm a civilian , I don 't have a rank , but basically , we 're equals . Technically , I 'm in charge . I thought so . You have all the makings of an excellent leader , John . Well , thank you . - You going to eat your powerbar ? - Yes , Rodney . I told you , you shouldn 't have eaten yours so early in the day . I 'm starving . Usually Flora feeds us some sort of food when we visit . - Come on , you hardly ever eat yours . - No , Rodney . Well , will you give it to me later when you decide not to eat it ? You allow him to question you so incessantly ? I guess I 'm just used to it by now . Would it not be easier to beat him ? We don 't beat people where we come from . Why not ? Well , we find it 's not very effective in the long run ... unfortunately . Really ? You are a truly gentle leader , John . I admire that . Thank you , Harmony . There 's supposed to be a rope bridge here . - Well , maybe you 're reading the map wrong . { : } Maybe you 're reading the map wrong . { \ : n } - No , I think it 's pretty straight forward . { : } No , I think it 's straight forward . { \ : n } How old is this map ? It has been passed down from too many generations to know for sure . Okay , guess that bridge doesn 't exist . You two stay put . I 'm going to try to find a safe way across the river . Don 't worry , I 'll be right back . Where 'd you find that ? John 's bag . It 's not yours . - I 'm hungry . - What ? You can 't just take it like that . { : } You can 't just take it like that . { \ : n } - When I 'm hungry , I eat . - What 's gonna happen - when Sheppard finds out ? - Well , he 's not going to know , is he ? Yes , he is , { : } He is , I 'm gonna tell him . { \ : n } because I 'm going to tell him . - I wouldn 't do that if I were you . - Yeah , or what ? - I 'm the queen . - Not yet , you 're not , little sister . Trust me , you don 't want to be on my bad side . Right ? And what are you going to do ? Have me beaten ? All right , princess , just hand it over . See , now , you 're in trouble . You just wait till Sheppard gets back here ... - He 's gonna ... - I think I found a place for us to ... Is that my powerbar ? - She stole it . - I did not ! What ? You so did ! Tell him ! I would never do such a thing ! The second you were gone , she went into your bag . You are a liar ! - You are a lying liar ! - Please , who are you going to believe ? Well , if she stole it , Rodney , how come you 've got the wrapper ? Well , b ... I was trying to take it back from her , and then she wolfs it down and hands me the wrapper . Really ? Okay , you better come clean , brat . It 's okay , sweetie . Sometimes ... he makes me cry , too . All right , we need to get going here . All right ? I found a path . Can I navigate from the map ? Sure , as soon as we get back on the path . Now ... we go ... Right . Correct . - What was that ? - That 's probably the beast . Sorry , the what now ? The beast . The protector of the ruins of Laros . - Did Flora not tell you of it ? - I guess she forgot to mention it . Don 't worry . When you say " beast , " I 'm assuming that 's a figure of speech , right ? No , it 's a beast , all right ... though no one is quite certain what it looks like . Those who have cast their eyes upon it have quickly perished . But your little knife will protect us . I 'm the queen . It will not harm me . We may not get a chance to tell the beast that . It will know . Listen , why don 't we just tell your sisters { : } why don 't we say { \ : n } we made it as far as the ruins ? { : } we made it as far as the ruins ? { \ : n } We don 't actually have to make it there . They 'd never have to know the difference . { : } They never have to know the difference . { \ : n } I would know . Yeah , but you 're going to be queen , so who cares , right ? I care . My people care . Listen ... Perhaps it would be best if you stopped speaking . Your voice hurts my ears . Well , that beast could hurt my whole body , okay ? So I 'm sorry , but this is not what we signed up for . Sheppard , back me up here . { : } signed up for . Back me up here . { \ : n } John ? According to legend , the beast attacks silently . I thought you said the beast would know you were the queen . Well , it didn 't attack me . John ? Are you there ? It is strange , though ... the beast is supposed to only attack enemies of the throne . If it was going to kill anyone , it should have killed you . I 'm not an enemy to the throne . I 'm not ! I 'm here to protect you . Don 't move ! So far , I 'm not impressed . Drop your weapon . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } We have her . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } Map grid 11 in the small clearing . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } On our way . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } - Hand her over . - You 're Genii . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } Step aside , and hand her over . This is obviously some sort of huge misunderstanding . All right ? I 'm Dr. Rodney McKay . I 'm a close personal friend of Ladon Radim . You know , your leader ? I 'm your greatest ally ! You don 't know who I am ? I 'm the genius scientist . The friend of John Sheppard ? I gave you the bomb ? No ? Nothing ? - What do they teach you in Genii school ? { : } What do they teach in Genii school ? { \ : n } - Hand her over . Right now . - Okay , let 's just talk about this . - I 'm growing impatient . Our quarrel is not with you . Once you hand her over , you 're free to go . - Really ? - Yes . You wouldn 't . You took a sacred oath to protect me . - Nah , I don 't remember doing that . - I 'm going to count to three . One ... - Where have you been ? - Well , my spidey senses felt an ambush coming on . And you couldn 't mention it ? - Not without tipping them off , no . - Well , what took you so long ? { : } What took you so long ? { \ : n } We just about ... I had to take a position so I could shoot all three at once . You okay ? No . No , I most certainly am not . This one was going to hand me over to those men . - No , I wasn 't . - I saw it in your eyes . You were considering it . To save your own worthless , cowardly hide . I was keeping them talking , you know , I was buying us time . A little thing called " strategy " ? Obviously { : } A little thing called " strategy " ? You 're { \ : n } you 're too young to know anything about it . { : } too young to know anything about it . { \ : n } Oh , I understand strategy . In fact , I 'm forming one right now ... the second we return to the castle , I will instruct - my guards to ... - All right . Plenty of time to come up with punishments along the way . - But , John ... - Thumb screws , you like them ? Yes . Thumb screws are good . We better find some cover . That back-up he called is going to be here any minute . { : } he called is gonna be here any minute . { \ : n } All right , this 'll work . Those were Genii . Yeah , I picked up on that , Rodney . Thanks . So ... what are the Genii doing here ? And why do they want to kill her ? I mean , aside from the obvious reasons . Harmony ? I don 't know . I don 't like the Genii . But you know who they are . - Are you trading partners ? - Not anymore . - But you were . - Yes . But they cheated my mother on many trades . She banished them from our land . What about you ? When you 're queen , are you gonna start trade back up ? No ! Absolutely not . So maybe somebody in the royal court 's a little more willing to play ball . You know , once the path is cleared . If I were to die , my sister would succeed me . But if the Genii think that she would be more willing to trade than me , they are sadly mistaken . You really believe that Ladon would give { : } You really believe Ladon would give the { \ : n } the marching orders to kill a little girl ... { : } marching orders to kill a little girl ... { \ : n } even this one ? I don 't know how these people work . Maybe he told someone to fix the problem , { : } Maybe he told someone to fix that , { \ : n } and this is what they came up with . It 's creative . Knowing why they 're here really doesn 't help us out . All right , I need to get a take on how many { : } I need to get a take on how many { \ : n } are out there . You stay with her , okay ? { : } are out there . You stay with her , okay ? { \ : n } Sure . All right , stay here , and stay quiet . Of course , John . Thank you for taking care of this . I 'm not sure what I would do if you weren 't here . Tell me something , Doctor . The place where you sleep at night , is it guarded ? I know what you 're trying to do , { : } I know what you 're trying to do , { \ : n } and it 's not going to work , okay ? { : } it 's not going to work . { \ : n } I 'm not scared of you . You 're just a kid . A bratty little kid . I couldn 't care less that you 're going to be queen . { : } I don 't care you 're gonna be queen . { \ : n } In fact , nothing could impress me less , so { : } Nothing could impress me less , so { \ : n } why don 't you just cool it with the " bad seed " act { : } why don 't just cool it with bad seed act { \ : n } and just go back to ignoring me ? Surely they can 't guard you all the time ? Squad three , take up position on the ridge . Squad four , move to map grid nine . Acknowledged . Wonderful . Stop it . What are you doing ? I 'm burning your face into my memory . - You ... - This way I can give the bounty hunters an extremely accurate description of you . All right , Your Highness , I have had just about enough out of you with this whole ... { : } I have had just about enough out of ... { \ : n } I thought I said keep talking to the minimum ? I was ... she was ... How many Genii are out there , John ? If I had to guess , I 'd say all of them . What , so , a lot of them ? Yes , Rodney . A lot . This will make the pilgrimage most difficult . That 's funny , I was thinking the same thing . I find we have much in common , John . Yeah . Anyway , I figure we wait for nightfall and then head back to the settlement . Back to the settlement ? Yep , road trip 's over . But that would make this journey a failure . You win some , you lose some . If you want to be { : } You win some , you lose some . You wanna { \ : n } queen , you 've got to learn how to cut your losses . { : } be queen , learn how to cut your losses . { \ : n } But the lunar cycle is nearing its end . If I do not make it to the ruins by tomorrow 's sundown , I will forfeit the throne . I 'm sure they 'll make an exception . No , they cannot . It is our way . It 's too dangerous to move forward . For you , perhaps . If it 's too dangerous for me , it 's definitely too dangerous for you . We 're gonna wait for nightfall , and then we 're gonna head back to the village . - End of discussion . - Fat chance of that . It 's not your decision to make . I 'm the queen . No . Not yet . And until you are , you 're just a regular kid . I call the shots . Many would consider disobeying the queen a treasonous act . Well , I 'm sure they wouldn 't look too fondly on letting the queen get killed . We 're heading back . You should not be here . I was careful . No one saw me , don 't worry . We use this from now on to stay in contact . Does that mean it 's not over yet ? No . Her two guardians have complicated things greatly . They killed three of my men . Yes , well , they were an unforeseen complication . My apologies . Your apologies do me little good . We will increase your pay , don 't worry . Threefold . Threefold ? Triple the work , triple the pay . You want us to kill them all ? If they survive , they 'll come back and tell my sister that the Genii were involved . Now , we can 't have that , can we ? Listen ... - I 've been doing a little thinking . - Oh , you have , have you ? I 've got a Wraith stunner in my backpack . { : } I 've a Wraith stunner in my backpack . { \ : n } She can 't weigh more than 90 pounds . I say we stun her and just carry her back . Well , we can 't stun a 13-year-old girl . It 's kinda dangerous out there . { : } It 's kinda dangerous . { \ : n } I mean , the forests is crawling with Genii . { : } The forest is crawling with Genii . Who { \ : n } Who knows when she could throw one of her fits ? { : } knows when she 'd throw one of her fits ? { \ : n } She 'll be fine . She understands how dangerous this situation is . { : } She understands how dangerous this is . { \ : n } - I talked to her . - I 'm sure you did , but she 's 13 , she 's unreasonable , among many other awful attributes . You know , they say you dislike { : } They say you dislike { \ : n } the things in others that you , in fact , dislike about yourself . So , what ? I 'm just saying . - We 're nothing alike . - Okay . She 's a stuck-up , know-it-all brat . All right , it 's about as dark as it 's gonna get . { : } It 's about as dark as it 's gonna get . { \ : n } Let 's wake her up and get moving . Oh , no . Oh , that sneaky little ... I told you we should 've stunned her ! { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } I 'm gonna kill her . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } You really need to work on your child skills . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } We have been searching for her for over an hour . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } We have had not one , but two { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } close encounters with the Genii . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } All so some useless , spoiled brat { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } can make her meditation appointment ? { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } - More searching , less complaining . - Sorry , I 'm hungry , { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } - and when I 'm hungry , I get cranky . - And when you get cranky , you get hit . Okay , okay . I wish Ronon was here . You know , you said that out loud , right ? I mean , I 'm right here . Well , it 's nothing personal . It 's just he 's a better tracker than both of us combined . That 's true . Okay , I 'm starting to hallucinate . - Why ? What do you see ? - Not see . Smell . I smell food . Delicious , fresh-cooked food . Roast beef , hamburgers , hot dogs , pork on a spit . Chicken . - Yeah , sure , the more , the merrier . - No , I smell chicken . The nose that knows . Follow me . Ah . Found it . It 's coming from down there . Told you . You don 't need Ronon while I 'm here . What do you think ? - Genii camp ? - Give me your stunner . All right , stay behind me . John ! How did you find me ? We could smell your fire a mile away . That 's okay . I was finished cooking anyway . You ran away from us . You didn 't give me any choice . We 've been out there searching for over an hour . We almost were caught twice . Yes , it 's very dangerous out there right now . That 's why I decided to seek refuge in this cave and make camp . You made all of this ? Yes , and caught a loden bird . - They 're quite delicious . - How ? You made all this with that ? I told you , I completed three sessions with Nolar Lumsbred . - And they covered all that in three sessions ? { : } They covered all that in 3 sessions ? { \ : n } - I am a quick learner . Do you not listen ? You 're mad at me . Our first fight . I knew it would happen eventually . We 'll laugh about this one day . I 'm sure we will , but we got to get moving . Right after we 've eaten the loden bird . Or not . That sounded very , very close . 00 : 22 : 06,226 - - 00 : 22 : 08,063 I brought you the bird 's heart . My people believe it brings you great luck once consumed . Thanks , but no thanks . - You 're sure ? - Pretty sure , yeah . Very well . Are you still mad at me ? No , I 'm over it . That 's good . - I don 't like it when you 're mad at me . - Well , don 't give me reason to be mad . Very well . So you 're 13 , huh ? I 'll be 14 in five lunar cycles . Right . Nervous about being queen ? No . - Why would I be ? - Well , it 's a lot of responsibility . I know that . You 've got to put the needs of your people { : } You gotta put the needs of your people before anything else , including your own . { : } before anything else including your own . { \ : n } - Some of the time , yes . - No , pretty much all the time . I 'm sure I will strike a proper balance . Just remember ... you 're not queen because of divine right , you 're queen because they allow you to be queen . If you 're mean to the people , they may change their minds . Just remember that . You know much about leadership , John . Hard-earned lessons along the way . And I know much about my people . I hope so . I think we would make a good team . As queen ... I will one day need a king ... Listen , Harmony ... There 's no need to answer now . I know such an offer must be overwhelming . You shouldn 't make your decision rashly . Well , I 'm pretty sure I know which way I 'm leaning . You 're a great little lady . It 's just that ... - What the hell was that ? - The Genii just had a little run-in with the beast . All right , be a brave girl and stay here with McKay . Hey , hey ! How come I always get stuck being the babysitter ? You want to check out the beast ? No , I 'm good here . Thought so . Stay here . This is Mardola . I want an update . What 's taking so long ? I have men all along the path to the ruins . They 've gone another way . Well , obviously . They 're not idiots . You should be looking everywhere but the path to the ruins . I am , but it 's night , and this forest is vast and dense . My men are spread thin . What if they make it back to the village ? There 's no way that I could save relations between our two peoples then . We 've just lost contact with some of my men . We 're heading to their last-known co-ordinates . Maybe we 'll get lucky . Teran out . You 're a doctor , right ? Yes . Yes . I mean , I 'm not a medical doctor ... So you 're a liar ? No , I 'm a ... What do you want ? - What does love feel like ? - Oh , boy ... Because I think I 'm in love with John . Yeah , well , it wouldn 't be the first { : } It wouldn 't be the first time , { \ : n } time , and I 'm sure it won 't be the last . { : } and I 'm sure it won 't be the last . { \ : n } - What does that mean ? - It means that a lot of people , particularly alien women , tend to fall for John Sheppard 's good looks and charm . Not like me they don 't . He 's a bit old for you , don 't you think ? I hadn 't considered it . Yeah , well , he will , { : } He will , so don 't get your hopes up . { \ : n } so don 't get your hopes up . You 're not going to try and influence him , are you ? I won 't need to . Trust me . You don 't like me very much , do you ? No , that 's not true . I ... I don 't not like you . What does that mean ? It means that you have a very annoying attitude , { : } You have an annoying attitude , but I 'm willing to cut you some slack.but I 'm willing to cut you some slack , - because you 're still just a child . - Whereas if I were grown up , my annoying attitude would be less excusable ? That 's right . An adult would ... - Hey , I don 't have an attitude problem . - And I don 't not like you . Well , that 's sweet of you to say . So you promise not to get between John and me ? I promise . I 'll give you this ... you 're a lot more mature than the women he usually falls for . Thank you , Doctor . What do you got ? Two dead Genii . It 's not pretty . Multiple puncture wounds . You mean like teeth marks ? I don 't think so . So ... so , what ? Claws ? Talons ? A very sharp beak ? I don 't know . It 's not like anything I 've ever seen before . Over here . - What kind of creature could do this ? - It doesn 't matter . We don 't leave this forest until all three of them are dead . { \ pos ( 192,225 ) } What took you so long ? I thought for sure we 'd lost you ! { \ pos ( 192,225 ) } I ran into Genii . Had to lie low until it was safe to move . { \ pos ( 192,225 ) } - So what happened ? - I don 't know , { \ pos ( 192,225 ) } but whatever that beast thing is , it 's lethal . { \ pos ( 192,225 ) } I could have told you that . { \ pos ( 192,225 ) } Also ... { \ pos ( 192,225 ) } the Genii have shoot-to-kill orders for all of us . Super . All right , princess , let 's move . Wait ! What ? Where are you going ? Where does it look like ? We 're going back to the settlement . But we 're so close to the ruins . And it 's almost daybreak . The fact that it 's almost daybreak is a bad thing . We need the cover of night . I can 't come this far and just turn back . I refuse . You know , I still have the unner-stay . The best thing you could do is go that way . That sounded a little weird . Hating to agree with the child , but ... Give me that . The beast will avoid the ruins . - We 'll be safe there . - How far are they ? A half hour or so . So what do you say ? Well , it 's better than running into the beast . I was afraid of this . That 's sacred ground . How dare he ? Hey . Hey ! We 'll handle this , all right ? - I 'll do that . - I got it . It 's okay . - Really , just ... just ... - Steady ... come to papa . Let 's go ... - Hey ! Hey . - What ? You have subdued him . Now we can go . Oh ! Fascinating . Ancient ? Yeah . Obviously . It 's weird ... this place seems strangely familiar . It 's even more beautiful than I imagined . Something 's wrong . What ? It 's not working . Shouldn 't you be , like , silently meditating or something ? My pendant ... it 's supposed to glow . Well , I 'll be damned . - Let me guess . - Oh , yeah , it 's Ancient . It 's the Pendant of Laros . The queen , and only the true queen , must return it to the ruins . Once here , it is to glow and imbue me with great power . Your sisters kind of failed to mention that . It is one of our greatest secrets . It 's the testing ground . - What ? - I know what this place is ! I 've been reading about it . We 've been looking for it for the last two years . - I 've seen the schematics . - Share with the class . Well , believe it or not , this place actually does control the beast ... - if the beast is what I think it is . - Which is ? Mini-drones , if I 'm right , and you know { : } Mini-drones , if I 'm right , and { \ : n } you can usually take that to the bank . This planet must have been where the Ancients first developed drone technology . { : } Ancients first developed drone tech . { \ : n } It was their main testing ground ! That would explain why the Genii look like swiss cheese . - The mini-drones went right through 'em ! - And that noise the beast was making was more like an electric swarm than a growl . So the pendant is ... Probably some sort of pass-key . I mean , Ancients weren 't above protecting { : } Ancients weren 't above protecting { \ : n } their research , even from each other . You need more than just the gene in order to activate or control the drones , otherwise ... Yes , yes , yes , of course ! It 's in auto-protect mode ! They 're trolling the forest , taking out anybody without the gene . That 's why they stayed clear of us and went straight for the Genii . The royal pain here must have it , as well . Why isn 't it working ? Well , maybe because genius over there - was messing with the crystal tray ? - All right , so ? Well , so give me a second to figure out how much damage he 's done . The machine is broken . That 's why your pendant isn 't glowing . It 's got nothing to do with machines . If I am worthy of being queen , the Gods will bestow the power of pure light and make my pendant glow . Well , who knows what kind of wacky rules they 've imposed on it . I mean , I suppose it 's possible that once a generation , the key needs to be reactivated here . Maybe it 's the one thing { : } reactivated here . Maybe it 's the thing { \ : n } that allows them to use the Ancient - tech they have back at the castle . - It 's complicated , but it will light up . We just need to make some repairs . You don 't understand . I 've failed . Maybe I 'm not supposed to be queen . Maybe ... maybe we 've come all this way for nothing . Trust me , it 'll glow . Wake up . What 'd you do to this thing ? I 'm not sure . I just rearranged the crystals . Don 't tell them a thing . They 're going to kill us one way or the other . Can you get it to work ? Not quickly . I can come back with a Jumper and a small team and get it working . Listen . - We 're going to head back . - No ! If I return with a darkened pendant , I won 't be allowed to ... Yes , you will be queen , I promise you ! It 's just busted . This isn 't the type of thing where you got a second chance , John , please . I can do it . I just need to focus more . Easy does it . Huron , come in . Huron . Come in . If we don 't respond , they 're going to come and investigate . Huron here . What 's your status ? Good . Elaborate . - Real good . - Help us ! Kinda busy , got to go ! Well , it was worth a shot . You got to get that thing workin ' , fast . Why can 't we just run for it ? We 're boxed in from all directions . We 've got to get - those mini-drones working , or ... - Or we die . { \ pos ( 192,225 ) } You know , you 're not exactly inspiring confidence . { \ pos ( 192,225 ) } Yeah ? How so ? { \ pos ( 192,225 ) } You 're hiding behind a foot of solid rock . How am I supposed to feel out here { \ pos ( 192,225 ) } with only a cool breeze between me and the Genii ? You 're more than welcome to come get cover for yourself , as soon as you 're done with those repairs . Do you have any idea how many crystal placement combinations there are ? - More than seven ? - Try 7,000 . Well , that 's less than infinite . All right , look . It 's going to get very , very noisy when the Genii get here . Screaming ? No , these guns , they make a lot of noise . It 's very important that you stay put and keep your ears covered , okay ? Shouldn 't you give me a gun instead ? You 're gonna stay put , cover your ears , and you 're not gonna move , okay ? Son of bitch ! I think I got it ! Harmony ! What did I just say ? Go , go , go , go ! You 're surrounded ! You have limited ammunition , and I have unlimited men ! We 'll take our chances . If you make this hard , I will make your death as slow and as painful as possible . Okay , what 's option number two ? Give us the girl , and we 'll let you go free . Never ! They would rather die than deal with the likes of you savages . When my sisters hear of this , the Genii will be finished ! Finished , do you hear ? How do you think we knew how to find you , little one ? You lie ! Come at us with all you have ! I shall silence you once and for all ! Let us handle this , okay ? You have one minute ! It can 't be true . It doesn 't matter right now , to be honest . How can you say that ? Did you get that thing working ? Yeah , before they started shooting at it . So it 's broken again ? It was powered up . 50-50 chance it 's still operational . Provide me with cover . I 'll make it to the pedestal , summon the beast , and smite them . There 'll be no smiting today , little lady . You 've never even used that thing before . But I am the queen , and the beast is my protector . It 's a little more complicated than that . You say anyone with the Ancient gene can activate it ? Yeah , as long as they 're wearing the pendant . Exactly ! 50-50 ? 100 % chance they 'll kill us if we talk about it for much longer . - You got a full mag there ? - Locked and loaded . On three ? Okay . Yes . Excellent . One ... two ... three ! What are you waiting for ? Shoot him ! You all right ? Yeah , I 'm good . You ? Sure , sure . That was the bravest thing I 've ever seen . You 're young . I 'm sure you 'll meet even braver men than me as you get older . Not you , usurper ! You 're lucky I like you , or you would be hung for treason ! But you ... you saved my life . - I did ? - When the Genii started firing at me , you threw yourself on me , - using your own body as a shield . - Oh , no . No , no , no . I just ... I tripped and fell on top of you . It was an accident . And then ... you pulled me to safety . You don 't ... don 't not like me . You like me ! No . No , no . No , I 'm ... Yes ! You saved my life and restored the ruins . You are a hero , Dr. McKay , both to me and my people . Well , I don 't know about " hero . " I mean , exceptionally courageous , perhaps ... And modest , too . It 's time to go , before the Genii come back . I doubt it . They are a simple people , and I 'm sure they were most impressed by your actions . I , however , was not . The pendant still glows . The gods have deemed me worthy . Now we can go . You 've returned ! What are you doing ? These are my private quarters . It 's all right , Mardola . They 've already searched my room . - You should allow it . - Why ? The Genii attacked us . Oh , well , it was a good thing Colonel Sheppard was there to protect you . They knew the location of the ruins , Mardola . How ? You ask as if I would know . You 're too young to be queen , Harmony ! Perhaps ... but when you 're released from prison , you 'll be too old to remember . Dr. Rodney McKay and Colonel John Sheppard , your contribution to my people may never be repaid . Well , we didn 't do it for compensation , Your Highness-ness . Kiss-ass . I personally owe you a debt of gratitude for your help defeating the regicidal Genii . I 've had one of the Court 's finest artisans feature you in a rendering of our glorious victory . Yeah , pretty much how I remember it . Are we sure this isn 't the beast 's cave ? You 're so ignorant . The beast doesn 't live in caves . We should stay here until the coast is clear . All right . Half-hour , tops . Good . I 'm hungry .

Replication Center Level 9 , we have a B 1 security alert . Stand by for ID check , please . Sit down . Replication Center Level 9 , we have a B 1 security alert . Stand by for ... Care if I talk ? I 'm kind of nervous when I take tests . Just please don 't move . Oh , sorry . I already had an IQ test this year . I don 't think I 've had one of these . Reaction time is a factor , so pay attention . Now answer as quickly as you can . Sure . 1187 at Hunterwasser . That 's the hotel . - What ? - Where I live . - Nice place ? - Yeah , sure , I guess . Is that part of the test ? No . Just warming you up . That 's all . It 's not fancy or anything . You 're in a desert , walking along in the sand , when ... Is this the test , now ? Yes . You 're in a desert , walking along in the sand when you look down ... - What one ? - What ? - What desert ? Doesn 't make any difference . It 's completely hypothetical . - But how come I 'd be there ? - Maybe you 're fed up . Maybe you wanna be by yourself . Who knows ? You look down and see a tortoise . - It 's crawling towards you ... - Tortoise ? What 's that ? - You know what a turtle is ? - Of course . Same thing . I 've never seen a turtle . But I understand what you mean . You reach down , you flip the tortoise over on its back . Do you make up these questions , Mr. Holden ? Or do they write them down for you ? The tortoise lays on its back , its belly baking in the sun beating its legs , trying to turn itself over , but it can 't not without your help . - You 're not helping . - What do you mean I 'm not ? I mean , you 're not helping . Why is that , Leon ? They 're just questions , Leon . In answer to your query , they 're written down for me . It 's a test designed to provoke an emotional response . Shall we continue ? Describe in single words only the good things that come into your mind about your mother . - My mother ? - Yeah . Let me tell you about my mother . A new life awaits you in the Off-world colonies . The chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure . A new life awaits you in the Off-world colonies . The chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure . The custom-tailored , genetically engineered humanoid Replicant designed especially for your needs . So come on , America . Let 's put out ... Give me four . No , four . Two , two . Four . And noodles . Hey . He say you under arrest , Mr. Deckard . Got the wrong guy , pal . He say you Blade Runner . Tell him I 'm eating . Captain Bryant ... Bryant , huh ? Yellow 3 . Climb and maintain 4000 . Final descent . Now on glide path . Mark course . Over the landing threshold . Hiya , Deck . Bryant . You wouldn 't have come if I just asked you to . Sit down , pal . come on , don 't be an asshole , Deckard . I 've got four skin-jobs walking the streets . They jumped a shuttle Off-world , killed the crew and passengers . They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks ago so we know they 're around . Embarrassing . No , sir , not embarrassing . No one 's ever gonna find out they 're down here . Because you 're gonna spot them and air them out . I don 't work here anymore . Give it to Holden . - He 's good . - I did . He can breathe okay as long as nobody unplugs him . He 's not good enough . Not good as you . I need you , Deck . Now , this is a bad one , the worst yet . I need the old Blade Runner . I need your magic . I was quit when I come in here , Bryant . I 'm twice as quit now . Stop right where you are . You know the score , pal ? If you 're not cop , you 're little people . No choice , huh ? No choice , pal . I already had an IQ test this year . I don ' t think I 've ever had one of these . Reaction time is a factor , so please pay attention . - Answer as quickly as you can . - Yeah , sure . 1187 at Hunterwasser . Yeah . That 's the hotel . - What ? - Where I live . - Nice place ? - Yeah , sure , I guess . There was an escape from the Off-world colonies two weeks ago . Six Replicants : three male , three female . They slaughtered 23 people and jumped a shuttle . An aerial patrol spotted the ship off the coast . No crew , no sight of them . Three nights ago they tried to break into Tyrell Corporation . Two of them got fried running through an electrical field . We lost the others . On the possibility they might try to infiltrate as employees I had Holden go over and run Voight - Kampff tests on the new workers . Looks like he got himself one . So you look down and you see a tortoise . It 's crawling towards you . - Tortoise ? - That 's Leon . Ammunition loader on intergalactic runs . He can lift 400-pound atomic loads all day and night . The only way you can hurt him is to kill him . I don 't get it . What do they risk coming back to Earth for ? That 's unusual . Why ... ? What do they want out of the Tyrell Corporation ? Well , you tell me , pal . That 's what you 're here for . - What 's this ? - Nexus 6 . Roy Batty . Incept date : 2016 . Combat model . Optimum self-sufficiency . Probably the leader . This is Zhora . She 's trained for an Off-world kick murder squad . Talk about Beauty and the Beast . She 's both . The fourth skin-job is Pris , a basic pleasure model . The standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies . They were designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions . The designers reckoned after a few years they might develop their own emotional responses . Oh , hate , love , fear , anger , envy . So they built in a fail-safe device . - Which is what ? - Four-year lifespan . Now , there 's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation . - I want you to go put the machine on it . - And if the machine doesn 't work ? Do you like our owl ? It 's artificial ? Of course it is . Must be expensive . Very . I 'm Rachael . Deckard . It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public . Replicants are like any other machine : They 're either a benefit or a hazard . If they 're a benefit , it 's not my problem . May I ask you a personal question ? Sure . Have you ever retired a human by mistake ? No . - But in your position , that is a risk . - Is this to be an empathy test ? Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response ? Fluctuation of the pupil . Involuntary dilation of the iris . We call it Voight-Kampff for short . Mr. Deckard , Dr. Eldon Tyrell . Demonstrate it . I wanna see it work . - Where 's the subject ? - I wanna see it work on a person . I wanna see a negative before I provide you with a positive . What 's that gonna prove ? Indulge me . On you ? Try her . It 's too bright in here . Do you mind if I smoke ? It won 't affect the test . All right , I 'm gonna ask you a series of questions . Just relax and answer them as simply as you can . It 's your birthday . Someone gives you a calfskin wallet . I wouldn 't accept it . Also , I 'd report the person who gave it to me to the police . You 've got a little boy . He shows you his butterfly collection plus the killing jar . I 'd take him to the doctor . You 're watching television . Suddenly you realize there 's a wasp crawling on your arm . I 'd kill it . You 're reading a magazine . You come across a full-page nude photo of a girl . Is this testing whether I 'm a Replicant or a lesbian , Mr. Deckard ? Just answer the questions , please . You show it to your husband . He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall . - bush outside your window ? I wouldn 't let him . - orange body , green legs ? Why not ? I should be enough for him . One more question . You 're watching a stage play , a banquet is in progress . The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters . The entr√©e consists of boiled dog .

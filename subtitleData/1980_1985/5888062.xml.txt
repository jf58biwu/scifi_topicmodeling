 I only hope your mad scientist is going to be worth the trouble . Nothing mad about Justin . At least there wasn 't , the last time I saw him . Oh ? And when was that ? Oh , he was a friend of my father 's , and one of the specialist tutors who visited us for a while to help educate me . I don 't envy him that job . Will he remember you ? I should hope so . Slave , confirm preset orbit approach to Bucol Two . Yes , sir . We 're on the correct orbit approach to Bucol Two and are now within teleport range of the desired coordinates . - Ready for teleport ? - Ready as I 'll ever be . Set ? Set . Good luck . - Scorpio . Down safe . - TARRANT : Right , standing by . - Let me know when you make contact . - Right . Out . ( Beeping ) - I 'm sorry to bother you , sir . - Yes , what is it ? I have detected Federation pursuit ships . Dayna , respond , please . Dayna , can you hear me ? - Slave , check for malfunction . - I can find no trace of one , sir . - Dayna ... - Sir , I would draw your attention to Federation ships in line astern approaching on bearing 160 . That 's a bit sudden , isn 't it ? - Plasma bolts released and running . - Yes , it is a bit sudden . - Estimated time of impact , 24 seconds . - Course for evasion . Vector 035 . 035 , all drives on , all maximum . Hit it ! - Second salvo released and running , sir . - Evasion course . ( Slave stammering ) Come on , come on ! Well , try 072 . 072 it is . Sir , the third ship has fired its salvo . Impact in 22 seconds . I suggest course 023 . Soon . Uh . What ? Right , 023 . Who , what are you ? ( Growling ) Slave , give me a course for base . Course for base , 134 . - I repeat ... - I have it . - Oh , sorry , sir . - And don 't keep saying you 're sorry . - Sorry , sir . - Don 't ! What the hell . Preliminary damage survey , Slave . Main teleport system is damaged to a degree as yet unspecified . Navigation systems register first warning of malfunction . Main detectors show 50 % is functional . Further damage is under assessment . - A mess , in fact . - Yes . I 'm sorry , sir . So am I , Slave . Coming to 134 . Dayna ! In here , quick ! - Justin , it is good ... - One moment . Go into the lab . Go into the bunker , Og . Go to your quarters . There is food there . Food , Og . Go and eat the food . It is waiting for you . My work ... as you see . Here ... let me take those slides . They 're rather important . Now , have you recovered , or can I offer you a stimulant ? Oh , no , no , no . I 'm fine now . Thank you for rescuing me . But what are those animals ? In good time . Here . Let me look at you . My little pupil Dayna , lovelier than ever . Still playing with your guns , Dayna ? They were never toys . Even less so , now . Do sit down . You know , I 'd no idea you were still alive . Most of my pupils of your time are dead , perished in the Galactic War . That war was a terrible , terrible mistake . I had to kill two of the animals . Ah . Pity . Still the warrior , hmm ? Look , do have a stimulant . It 's just adrenalin and soma , I 'm afraid . I drink ... rather a lot of it here on my own . - You 're the only one working here ? - The only human working here , yes . I 'm training the animals to work , of course , but it 's slow . Very slow . I 've got them right physically , you see ... but it 's the psychology that 's difficult . All they want to do is exist . However , I 'm trying brain implants and so on ... but they hate it , it 's painful . That 's why they rebelled and broke out . - The most developed ones ? - Yeah . Oh , they 'll come back in . They have just enough intelligence not to starve . So you 're experimenting on them by genetic restructuring and transplants . I am a genetic engineer , among other things , or had you forgotten ? I learnt the surgery later . Having a lot of success , too . You are making a new race of animals . Or humans . Why ? Ah , well , I can 't tell you all my secrets , can I , Dayna ? It 's nice to see you . You look very well . I would say beautiful but I 'm a scientist and we 're supposed to be short on emotion and all that sort of thing , aren 't we ? But I will say you look quite beautiful , my ... Admiring the work ? I think it 's ... disgusting . AVON : Absolutely not . Maintain your present course . Abandon Dayna , keep running for base and bring that ship back . It will take us quite long enough to repair the damage you have already done . What do you mean , the damage I 've done ? One 's just given up . Good . The others will soon follow . All except Og . He 's had one extra transplant , so ... Oh , but I forgot , you find all this disgusting . Yes , I do . If life is to go on , homo sapiens , that is , we have to do these things . What are you doing it for ? I can 't tell you , not yet . Now ... You sent a message you wanted to see me . Are you a refugee or what ? I could offer you a job helping me here , but I don 't think you 'd take it , would you ? - No , I wouldn 't . - Oh , pity , I could do with some help . Scorpio . Scorpio , this is Dayna , come in , please . Tarrant , respond , please . I can 't help you , either . The animals smashed my transmitter system when they broke out . All I 've got left is my intercom . Anyway ... tell me about yourself . Well , I 'm one of a small group fighting the Federation . We 've got a base , we 're gathering equipment and looking for allies . We 're also trying to recruit experts . Specialists in relevant fields . - Relevant to what ? - The eventual destruction of the Federation . Relevant to war , in fact . Possibly . Unless the Federation have become pacifists , it has to be war . If they were pacifists , the problem wouldn 't exist . And it is a problem for which you see yourselves as the solution . We are led by a man called Avon . He thinks we need someone like you . We 'll be going into radioactive areas from time to time and that is your field . - Or it was . - It still is . Avon thinks it might also be possible to use genetic engineering techniques to synthesise a drug we need . - For what ? - Protection . Against the pacification drug the Federation use . I once worked for the Federation . - Did you ? - Yes . And I liked their proposition even less than I like yours . Of course ... if you wanted to stay on your own , that would be different . Would it ? Yes . You know it would . What is all that ? One of our pursuit units engaged an unidentified planet-hopper . They refused to obey a stand-and-be-searched order and the pursuit commander opened fire . Why all the interest ? What 's one civilian cargo ship more or less ? It turned out to be more than just an ordinary cargo ship . They estimated its initial acceleration at time distort 12 . Plasma bolts slowed it up , but not by much . That planet-hopper left our pursuit ships for dead . - Did they give chase ? - They lost it . Around here . Where did they first see it ? Here , in the region of Bucol Two . What do we know about that planet ? Intelligence appraisal . It 's out of date , Commissioner Sleer . - It 's from before the Galactic War . - Never mind , what does it say ? " Bucol Two 's planet was abandoned after mineral deposits were exhausted . " Not used again until six years before the war . " When it was used for what ? Doesn 't say , just a footnote , " Refer code W secret . " Planet designated an experimental area , budget 20 million credits , " security code double-X . " Any more ? " Scientific experimental area developed further during the war but the work was then abandoned . " At which point presumably the planet was abandoned too . Never presume anything , Captain . As I recall , code double-X means nothing is recorded . Well , there 's certainly nothing down here about the work they were doing . And there won 't be anything anywhere else , but they were there on Bucol Two towards the end of the war . And they spent 20 million credits on whatever it was . A new weapon ? Does it give any other information ? The names of the principal scientific officers , anything at all ? Gives the name " Justin " , nothing else . A planet-hopper that can outrun a pursuit unit , hovering over a useless planet that has been abandoned since the war . Set a course for Bucol Two . ( All screaming ) How could I admire you doing this ? You came here expecting more ? A young love resurrected ? Ah , well ... perhaps I 'd better tell you one or two things , then I might not seem such an ogre to you . I don 't think anything you could tell me would change my mind . I think it could . You don 't think I built this laboratory complex on my own , do you ? I was the head of a Federation scientific warfare team . When the Galactic War was nearly over , the work was abandoned and all my fellow scientists left . I didn 't go with them , which was just as well , since they were blasted by an enemy gunship within minutes of taking off . Why did you stay ? To look after the animals , for one thing . And for another ... to try to finish the work we 'd started . Look , what was the object of the work ? It must have had some object , some war object if the Federation backed it and built this place . The war object was to create a species ... not necessarily human , that could go into areas heavy with radioactivity and act as shock troops . The Federation had suffered losses of up to 60 % frontline troops . Now , just think , what a few squads of radiation-proof space commandos could do . I 'm glad you never succeeded . - It was a horrible idea . - No . It was justified by the times . But how about now ? Why are you going on with it ? All this ? It 's insane . Well , just think ! Those animals can go into any of the devastated sectors of the war zone and the radiation won 't kill them . They can work on simple projects already . Og certainly could . They and their kind can make whole systems habitable again ... without the loss of a single human life . I know it seems callous to work on the animals as I do ... but the painful business of the physical transplants is over . All that is needed now is a few simple brain grafts ... and I 'm very close to home . Very close . Now do you see ? Orac , report on navigation control system . 60 % capacity is now restored . The fault in anti-grav gyro remains . We know it remains . We 're trying to find it , aren 't we , plastic-brain ? If I might be permitted to finish , the fault remains in the inertial guidance glycolene ballast channels . It 'll therefore be necessary for someone to enter the tank . Sounds messy . Physical inspection and adjustment is essential , if potentially uncomfortable . Sounds very messy . Now , look ! You can drown in that filthy muck down there . - Smells lovely . - No , it doesn 't . It 's disgusting . Well , somebody has to go down and you are the one with the delicate touch , Vila . - Magic hands . You 've often said so yourself . - Why do I get all the dirty jobs ? Typecasting ? - This isn 't fair , you know . - No . It 's pretty foul by the look of it . Oh , cheer up , Vila , you can have a hot tub when you come out , whether you need one or not . All right , I 'll do it . Anything is better than listening to your jokes . Stationary orbit established over the target position . Preliminary scan shows no sign of any radioactive contamination down there , or any other legacy from the war . So it 's habitable ? Probably , but there 's nothing to sustain civilised life . Only trees and soil useless for anything but the most primitive form of agriculture . Then what brought that planet-hopper here in the first place ? - Keep all systems on full alert . - Yes , Commissioner . ( Beeping ) Sleer to Federation Central Intelligence Control . Personal to Intelligence Commander Borr . Yes , Commissioner ? I want some Federation wartime double-X information on the planet Bucol Two . Double-X information was oral only , Commissioner . I know that . But someone must have the information locked in his head . I want you to track down any senior wartime intelligence operative of the department . Someone , somewhere must know what was happening on Bucol Two . Yes , Commissioner Sleer . It may take a little time . Make sure it is a little time . Yes , Commissioner . In order , my dear . - Oh , I 'm sorry , I wasn 't thinking . - Not at all , or not about this ? All right . You 've convinced me that you 're sincere , but not that it 's right to do what you 're doing . You must have started with men as well as animals to get crossbreeds . They were deserters . And the decision was not mine and it was war . Just the same ... I bitterly regret it . I 'm trying , in a way , to make sense of it all . Trying to get something good out of it all . Don 't you see that ? If this discovery ... simply goes for war purposes , to kill , then it 's all been in vain . Well , that makes me feel better about you , anyway . Still trying to think well of me ? Perhaps you are right to do what you are doing . If these animals can save human lives without any risk to themselves , then ... That is my aim . I think my group would be interested in your work . I don 't think I want your group involved . Commissioner , I have the sole operative remaining alive from the Bureau at the time of the experiments on Bucol Two . Who is he ? His name is Ardus , and he 's an ex-officer of the Bureau . Put him in the fastest scout ship available and send him here . No flight plan is to be filed . But that 's against Bureau standing orders , Commissioner . Who do you think wrote those orders , Borr ? I did . So do as I say , and do it now . At once , Commissioner Sleer . Commissioner Sleer , this is the man Ardus . You may sit . - What happened to your eyes ? - A radiation flare , Commissioner . This sonoscope stops me bumping into things , but I 'm blind by any normal criteria . Tell me , what were they doing on the planet Bucol Two towards the end of the war ? I 'm not sure I 'm empowered to divulge that , Commissioner . It was a top secret , oral-only operation . I don 't believe more than six people knew of it . I did not know of it . Some of our War Departments were laws unto themselves . I 'm sorry , why should you have known of it ? Only six War Intelligence Officers and Servalan , our president , knew of it . If ever she was told . Servalan ? Why do you mention Servalan ? - No reason , particularly . - No ? - Simply ... she came into my mind . - Why did she come into your mind ? I ... I cannot say , Commissioner . Very well ... I await your information . I think ... it would be improper of me to release it unless authorised by the High Council . Nonsense , it 's old stuff . No use to anybody . - Tell me . - I regret I cannot . Very well . Let me explain the scenario if you do not . I take it you do not care for your own life . But you have a family . I can rearrange their future quite dramatically , if you so insist . I know your voice . You are ... You are . I am sure of it . Be very careful what you are sure of , or I may lose my patience . Under protest . - I give the information under protest . - It is noted . The research programme on Bucol Two was directed towards combating and ultimately neutralising radioactive contamination . The work was progressing well , I understand , but too slowly to be used in the war . What form did it take ? Protective equipment , what ? As I understand it , they were genetic experiments . The man in charge was named Justin . They had an underground laboratory complex and large food supplies . And that is all I know . Very well . That will do . If I seemed to make a mistake in mentioning Servalan , I am sorry . An old man 's memory is suspect , Commissioner Sleer . Especially an old man whose eyes were burnt from his head . Naturally . It is forgotten . I know Servalan is now a non-person . I was incorrect in mentioning her name . You were . But as I say , it is forgotten . Show Ardus back to his ship . - This way . - Thank you , Commissioner . Thank you , Commissioner . Commissioner Sleer , is everything satisfactory ? When you dispatched Ardus here to me , did his pilot file a flight plan ? No , Commissioner . Everything was as you instructed . - They never arrived here , Borr . - But they must have done . I suggest you make sure that your connection with their disappearance is never discovered . Without any records to back you up , it might be quite hard to explain . There 's no cause for concern , Commissioner . I was very discreet . I hope so . Now , get me the photo print record on a scientist named Justin . A genetic engineer . Certainly . I want you to work out a landing plan for this ship on Bucol Two as soon as possible . Those animals have been out so long . Won 't they die ? They 'll come in when they 're hungry enough . All except Og . - And why won 't he ? - He 's further advanced . He began to know what we want him for and he 's afraid . I shall need to calm him , to reassure him . Try to get him to trust me again . Well , maybe he 'll never trust you again . It 's possible . Does he understand speech ? If you keep it simple , yes . He can 't speak , naturally . He 's programmed to obey , not argue . Yet he ran away . That was his animal instinct . Look ... if he won 't trust you , perhaps he 'll trust me . - Why should he ? - Because I 'm somebody else . Not you . Not the one who gave him pain . Does that make sense ? - It 's possible , I suppose . - Are you going to hurt him again ? There 's no need . I 've developed painless brain grafts for the others . All Og needs is psycho-instruction . You 're so rational about it all . Not as rational as you might think , Dayna . Quite emotional , really . I don 't believe it . Oh , it 's true . It 's absolutely true . I only wish it wasn 't . Why ? Oh ... I 've been on my own on this planet for so long now ... I don 't think I can cope with people any more . Yes , you can . Can I ? Yes . Like I said . Messy . Go and get cleaned up . Preferably somewhere else . Is that all the thanks I get ? Not even a glass of wine ? We 've used the best of it up . Correction . You 've used the best of it up . Orac , is the navigation system fully operational now ? No , it is recommended that a further overhaul of the glycolene ballast channels be carried out . - What ? - It 's lucky you didn 't get cleaned up . - Or boozed up . - Would you settle for fed up ? - It 's somebody else 's turn . - Try and do it right this time , Vila . A glass of wine when I come up or I don 't do it at all . Half a glass . - Before I go down ? - Don 't push your luck . What luck ? Where will they be , do you think ? Probably by the cliff . ( Howling ) Make for the ridge . It 's a natural vantage point . Captain . I want you to make sure we 're ready to lift off this mudball at the first sign of trouble . We will be , Commissioner . Og . I mean no harm , Og . I want to help . I am your friend , Og . I think Justin is also your friend . You 're very hungry , aren 't you ? Very , very hungry . ( Growling ) If you come back into the compound , into your quarters , I promise you will not be hurt . I promise you will be treated properly . Not hurt . Not your head . Not hurt . Og , come back with me . The others will follow . Justin ! Orac , status of the teleport system ? - 86 % function . - That 's better than normal . - I 've got the personal intercoms working again . - Right . - How 's our armament situation ? - Good as it 'll ever be . We couldn 't hold off a Federation patrol with it , but we knew that already . If we 're going to Bucol Two we shall need all the fire power we can muster . So long as you remember we 're smoke if they get to us . Are we expecting trouble on this trip ? A Federation patrol attacked Scorpio at Bucol Two . They might wonder what it was doing there in the first place . I would , in their position . Then it 's dead stupid of us to go there , right ? " Dead " being the operative word . Dayna is there . And I 'm sorry about that , but I don 't see why I should be punished for your guilty conscience . Orac , are we fit to fly ? Fit to fly , certainly . You have fully functioning drive units and the navigation systems are 96 % effective . - There is one recommendation , however . - A test flight ? Test flights are usual after repairs and replacements of this magnitude . - That would take 24 hours at least . - Would 24 hours kill us ? It might kill Dayna . Or it might put her into the hands of the Federation . At which point this base loses its value . Get what you need . I want to lift off within an hour . Dayna . Dayna . ( Echoing ) Dayna ! We must talk about your friend soon . But first , tell me about the animals . Nothing to tell . Simply an unimportant genetic experiment . I don 't think so . These animals are radiation-proof . That 's worth a great deal to the Federation . Since you know all that , why ask me ? Tell me about Justin . Justin ? Who 's he ? Behave like a fool , by all means . But don 't treat me like one . You know who he is , obviously . Yes , I do . A top geneticist . How far has he got with his work with the animals ? His work ... isn 't yet complete . How far ? I don 't know . Simply not finalised . Who 's with him , helping him ? A full company of troopers left over from the war . He 's alone , isn 't he ? He has nobody , has he ? Why do you lie for him ? Why do you suffer pain for him ? Do you love him ? Of course not . So ... you do love him . Very much . Obviously . Is he underground still ? According to my information he was in underground bunkers , virtually impregnable and with enough food and water to last 100 years . Yes , he is . Quite impregnable . You 'll never get to him . I need him , Dayna . I need him alive . The animals are no use to me without him . I have to have him , Dayna . You do see that . I can 't help you . - You can . - How ? You can go to him and tell him that I will guarantee his safety and the continuation of his experiments with only one condition . - Which is ? - That I use the animals in the way I think fit . - I won 't take him that message . - Why not ? He isn 't interested in offers . He doesn 't want Federation help or any help . He just wants to be left alone . He can 't be left alone . Surely you can see that . You have his affection , yes ? He trusts you . Then all you do is go and tell him to do a deal with us . No , I won 't . Yes , you will . Won 't you ? No . Pity . It 's an old one , but it 's him , right ? Yes . Every time you see him , you 're going to hate him . No ! In the end you 'll tell me you hate him and when I believe you I 'll stop . I 'll never hate him . You will . You really hate him now , don 't you ? - Yes . - Say it . - I hate him . - Again . I hate him . Excellent . So ... you 're going to help me , aren 't you ? What do you want me to do ? Get him to let you into the laboratory , then you let us in . Yes . All right . Good . SERVALAN : Remember you hate him . Remember you hate him . Remember you hate him . Come inside , quickly . Oh , my love , I thought you were dead . What happened ? Are you all right ? Yes , yes , I 'm fine . I 've missed you . You 've no idea how much . I knew I was fond of you , but when I couldn 't find you - and the animals had run , I thought ... - What 's happened ? - All these slides , they 're broken ! - I destroyed everything . - Why ? - I was sure they 'd killed you . I see . Don 't fuss , I 'm fine . You seem in a serious state of shock to me . You 're trembling . No , really , I 'm all right . - Here , this is a good sedative , try it . - No , I told you , I am fine ! I see , all right , all right . It 's a pity you destroyed everything . I 've still got a lot of the research here in my head . You can help me put it all together again , can 't you ? - Yes . - You 'd like to do that , wouldn 't you ? - Yes , of course . - I 'm glad . Your girlfriend let us in . - Who are you ? - Sleer . - Federation Security Commissioner . - Federation ? - You 're not a Federation agent , are you ? - No , she isn 't . - What have you done to her ? - Made her hate you . Simple aversion therapy . It can be reversed quite easily , provided you are reasonable . What do you want ? Your work ... and the animals . My work is destroyed . Then you die . Both of you . It 's in his head . - He said so . - That 's better . Right . You three , get that animal . Does he have a name ? Og . - When you have him , you have it all . - Good . If you have to wing him , do it . But don 't kill him . Vila , down safe . Right . ( Screaming ) SERVALAN : They have the animal . They have him . You two , this way . You first , Justin . Dayna , please . She hates you , but she won 't once you start to work for us . Come on , outside . ( Screaming ) Did you hear that ? It came from that direction . ( Muffled explosion ) TARRANT : Avon . Look , it 's Dayna 's . I want a quick résumé of what you 've been doing , and how soon can that animal outside be cloned and in operation ? - You 'll get nothing until Dayna is normal again . - Normal ? - I mean it . Nothing . - I suppose I could convince you . You might damage my memory doing it . Yes , I might . All right , Dayna , sit in that chair . No ! - No ! - We won 't hurt you this time . Quite the opposite . - No , please . - Captain . Dayna , can you hear me ? - SERVALAN : You love him , Dayna . - Dayna . - You love him . - This is Avon . Where are you ? - You love him , Dayna . - Dayna , respond . You love him . You love him , Dayna . You love him . Avon , southwest of bunker , half a mile . Federation ship . Prisoner . Be careful . So that 's who she fell out with . Let 's go . Justin ! What happened ? - Nothing , nothing . - That 's enough . All right , Justin . Tell me everything you know . Get that animal onto the ship . - Captain , prepare for immediate lift off . - Go , Dayna , go ! Get rid of that . Justin ! Justin ! Justin ! Justin . No . Oh , no . Oh , no . Vila , standby to bring us up .

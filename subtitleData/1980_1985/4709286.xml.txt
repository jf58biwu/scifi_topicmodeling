 A strange case ... A stranger steals corpses and tries to buy discreetly . Involuntary witness of the murder of Belloni , a nightclub owner , Patrick , a young intern hospitals , becomes involved in this gruesome trade . Forced to become effectively provider of bodies for the love of a young woman , Coretta , Patrick , after long days of waiting , successfully removed from the morgue the body of a young woman . He delivers the body to the unknown freeing Coretta from the threat that was weighing on her . Dramatic turn : Coretta sees Belloni appearing in front of her , the murdered night-club owner . He 's now calling himself Maubourdin . He 's the owner of a jeweler 's store and he doesn 't seem to recognize Coretta . New incomprehensible surprise : The very alive wife of Maubourdin is none other than the young woman of whom Patrick delivered the body to the unknown . Maubourdin leaves for a business trip and disappears . Stayed alone Mrs Maubourdin discloses to Patrick her incredible secret . Her and her husband come from another galaxy called EXI and were deported on planet Earth . Such as diving suits they had to dress themselves with human beings ' bodies to escape the pollution reigning over our planet . Patrick , still unbelieving , leaves in search of Maubourdin and falls on a closed down factory in which there are strange things happening ... Can you take me to a railway or cab station to make a phone call please ? Get in . Thank you . - Where are you going ? - To Paris And where do you come from ? Can we leave ? It 's ... It 's a miracle . No . Not really . I was keeping watch since a week . You feel better ? Why ? Strange stuff happening . I 'm worried . I can 't explain them . Your wife ... Your wife is worried too . I know . I 've finally called her . From here it 's practically impossible to make a phone call . The country is occupied by missionaries . Missionaries ? I know that you know our secret now . I 'm relieved about it . Missionaries are the people you met earlier . They 're in charge of the exodus . But ... who are they ? They 're officials from our galaxy . Our two planets have much in common . We have ... the same corporeal envelope . But we can 't stand your pollution so they come on Earth to study it . They study your attitudes too and they even have key positions in your society . And then they go back . And what am I to do in all this ? I think you 're the only one who could give me help . After what you 've been through you 're the only who will admit and understand the situation . I have the feeling that the EXI , my people in a certain way , will soon disappear . I 'm very worried about my wife . Somebody ? I think there is two guys there watching us . What do we do ? " Mrs Maubourdin is terrorized by men following her . I 've lost them with my motorbike . We 're going to Molivieu . Coretta . " Who is Molivieu ? I know him . He 's an EXI . He 's very important . One of the first landing here . But he was not particularly successful . To resume ... We could say that after the soul transfer we 're going through a formation , receive some money and after that we 're on our own . As we are particularly intelligent we generally get brilliant careers . Sirs , how can I help you ? I would like to see Mr Molivieu . - Do you have an appointment , Sir ? - No but give him this card please . Here are the two people annouced earlier . Sit down please . You 'd like to see Mr Molivieu ? What 's your reason ? I have no reason to give you . Just show me to him please . The problem is ... that Mr Molivieu was very ill recently . Call him at home then . Nobody answers the phone at his home . In fact he disappeared . What are you saying ? What 's going on ? You . Don 't move a finger . But you have no right to ... Sirs . Mr Molivieu asked me to give this to the first man showing a card in case something happened to him . Do you remember two young women coming here recently ? Yes but they left a soon as they get here . Thanks . I 'm really worried . This man is not an EXI but he still comes from our galaxy . You 're sure he 's not an EXI ? You certainly noticed ... that we have super-human strength . In fact it 's just mind focus . He couldn 't catch the statue I throw at him . He 's probably sent by the Power but I can 't explain the reason why . Bad news ? Yes . I 'm afraid . Mr Molivieu asks me not going to our bank in case of serious trouble . What do you mean by " bank " ? Well ... it 's not really a bank . It 's more like a financial structure . What are we doing now ? I don 't know . In my opinion we should still go to this " bank " . Your wife certainly needed money and asked Coretta to drive her there . Yes . You 're right . Let 's go . - Hello , Sir . - Sir . Can I speak to your manager ? I have some kind of trouble ... Can you give me your name ? My name is not important . I have no account here . But I intend to open one . I can 't do anything for you in this case . We don 't take new clients . Listen . I 'm a nice guy but ... you 'd better go and get me your manager or all this could go very wrong . Excuse me . I 'm going to get the manager . I 'm deeply sorry Sir . Our company is in full reorganization . Can I ask you who sent you here ? No-one . I 'd like to take a loan to open a clinic . I 'm a doctor . I 'm often in the neighborood and since your bank is also working with companies I told myself ... why not here . I 'm deeply sorry , Sir . Could you come back later ? Your clinic seems a very interesting project but we really can 't help you . Thanks a lot . Beware . I 'm being followed . You 're working here ? Yes . But I don 't understand . Let me go . I don 't have money . - Don 't fool me . Why are you following me ? - I was not following you . Sound the horn . What 's going on ? He 's not a man from the Power . I don 't understand . Anyway he 's only small fry . Still it 's strange . Let him run . We have more urgent things to do . Who 's that guy ? What 's he doing ? If he doesn 't come ... it 's our last chance . He 's a night-bird . He will come sooner or later . Beware . It 's him . I 'm going alone first . Can I talk with you ? About what ? You 'll see . You never saw me ? Come this way . So really ... you don 't recognize me ? Should I ? You don 't remember a certain waste ground where a certain hoodlum was killed on a certain night ? I 'm a sick man . Let me in peace . I don 't give a shit about your sickness . You 've got something to say and you will say it ! Somehing to say ? I don 't even know you . Well you ... I come back immediately . And this man . You don 't recognize him ? Doctors ... can 't explain my illness . They should have give me my X-ray photographs today but they kept them . They want ... I don 't know what they want . Study them again . Shom them to Scientists . In fact they don 't understand anything about my illness . But ... Who are you ? What are you afraid of ? I 'm only an executant . I obey orders . That 's all . Free your mind . You will feel better then . I 'm an EXI . As you . I agreed to work for the Power . They bought me . Now they only ... have contempt for me . I 'm a traitor . A traitor . And I 'm paying for that now . Can 't you see I 'm dying ? I ... I know curious things ... are happening . At the Training Center of Tressac . At the Kerlut Manor . It feels good to breath fresh air ... Did you notice the smell of rotten plants inside ? What do you say ? That smell ... like plants decomposing . Very unpleasant . I was suffocaing . Not you ? What 's going on ? - We 're going ? - Yes . What 's that thing ? An arasomea . What is an arasomea ? Answer . What is it ? A very small seed . Blowin in the wind . If swallowed it 's a tragedy . It finds the best environment for its growing in stomach . It produces a strong foliage which in the end will asphixiate the bearer . Only the EXI could catch the illness but it had completely vanished . Until today I had only heard about it . It 's the first case I see with my own eyes . Listen I think I ... I believe ... But what all that means ? I understand everything now . What the man from the bank had me breathing was ... was simply a seed . Listen . We 'll go to my study . I will examinate you and have you X-rayed . Then we 'll go and tell everything to the cops . I 'd rather not . As long as some EXI are alive and breathing around I don 't want to get the cops involved . It could bring us a lot of trouble . Effectively , I see ... traces ... some kind of stains . But I can 't explain them . Well .. it 's no use ... it 's no use hiding from the truth . I 've got an arasomea seed in my stomach . No . It 's not sure . It could be something else . Anyway you 're not suffering . So it 's a simple examination . In any case I find curious that you can feel things that can 't be explained . I 'm convinced all the EXI are in peril . With this seed they 've found our weakness . We must run to the Training Center . Maybe we could find something there . - You know the adress ? - Yes . The Kerlut Manor . In the Morbihan . Maybe we 'll be able to discover something else there . You don 't want to try the operation ? You know , it 's possible to live without stomach . No . It 's no use . It 's too late . I 'm not trusty . Let 's get inside by the back . What were you hoping to find here ? I don 't know . In any case , not a cemetary . I 'll have a look to these files . Ok . I leave you alone . I 'll have a look upstairs . You alright ? It 's what I feared . What ? It 's the great crisis ... The Power fears the civil war ... Why are they after you then ? Racism . You know ? I thought ... I thought it existed only on Earth . Our world is complex like yours . It 's a mosaic of States , Nations , tribes and when the times are difficult minorities are the first victims . What 's that noise ? I don 't know . They are AXE . People we 've been rised up against for centuries . It 's their turn to be exiled . It 's not me anymore who will preside over your destinies . A personnality has just arrived , much more qualified than me to lead you . My dear comrades , I 've got a lot of things to tell you . The first and the most unpleasant ... Our residency on Earth is permanent . Never you will make the trip back through space . The situation in our galaxy worsens every day . It turns to persecution . The only solution is to speed up the body transfers . I 've been appointed to tell you that it doesn 't work , not at all . We are restricted by the body numbers and we need bodies , a lot more bodies . I feel bad . I 've got to leave . Therefore we must begin to plan mass murders ! timings : meatisgood translation : aloysius70

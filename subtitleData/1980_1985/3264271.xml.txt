 Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan In the 23rd century ... Captain 's Log . Stardate 8130.3 . Starship Enterprise on training mission to Gamma Hydra . Section 14 , coordinates : 22 / 87 / 4 . Approaching Neutral Zone , all systems normal and functioning . Leaving Section 14 for Section 15 . Stand by . Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone . Yes , Capitain . Course change projected . Captain ! I 'm getting something on the distress channel . on speakers ! Imperative ! This is the Kobayashi Maru , 19 periods out of Altair Six . We have struck a gravitic mine and have lost all power ... This is the Starship Enterprise . Can you give us your coordinates ? Enterprise , our position is Gamma Hydra , Section 10 . In the Neutral Zone . Hull penetrated , life support systems failing . Can you assist us ? Data on Kobayashi Maru . Third class neutronic fuel carrier , crew of 81 . 300 passengers . Damn ! Mr Sulu ? Plot an intercept course . May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the Zone ... I 'm aware of my responsibilities , Mister . Estimating two minutes to intercept . - Now entering the Neutral Zone . - Warning . Neutral Zone entered . We are now in violation of Treaty . Stand by , Transporter Room , ready to beam survivors aboard . Captain ! I 've lost their signal . Sensors indicate three Klingon cruisers , bearing 316 mark 4 . - Closing fast . - Visual . Battle stations ! Activate shields ! - Shields activated ! - Say we are on a rescue mission . - They 're jamming all frequencies . - Klingons on attack course ... We 're in over our heads . Mr Sulu ! Get us out of here ! I , m try capitain . Alert ! Klingon torpedoes activated . Evasive action ! - Engineering ! Damage report ! - Main energiser hit ! Engage auxiliary power ! Prepare to return fire ! Shields collapsing , Captain ! - Fire all phasers ! - No power to the weapons , Captain . Captain , it 's no use ! We 're dead in space ! Activate escape pods ! Send out the Log Buoy . All hands abandon ship . All right . Open her up . - Any suggestions , Admiral ? - Prayer , Mr Saavik . The Klingons don 't take prisoners . Lights ! Motors on ! Captain ? Trainees ... to the briefing room . - Physician , heal thyself . - Is that all you 've got to say ? - What about my performance ? - I 'm not a drama critic . Are you gonna stay with the sinking ship ? - Permission to speak candidly , sir ? - Granted . I don 't believe this was a fair test of my command abilities . There was no way to win . Every commander may face a no-win situation . - Has that never occurred to you ? - No , sir . It has not . How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life . As I indicated , that thought had not occurred to me . Well , now you have something new to think about . Admiral ? Wouldn 't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship ? Galloping around the cosmos is a game for the young , Doctor . What is that supposed to mean ? Aren 't you dead ? You want to learn what efficiency rating I 'll give your cadets ? I am understandably curious . They destroyed the Simulator Room and you with it . The Kobayashi Maru scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment . You took the test three times yourself . Your final solution was , shall we say ... unique . It had the virtue of never having been tried . Oh , by the way ... thank you for this . I know of your fondness for antiques . " It was the best of times , it was the worst of times ... " - Message , Spock ? - None that I 'm conscious of . Except , of course , happy birthday . Surely , the best of times . Captain Spock , Captain Spock , space shuttle leaving in 15 minutes . - Where are you off to ? - The Enterprise . I must check in before your inspection . And you ? Home . Doctor ! What beams you into this neck of the woods ? " Beware of Romulans bearing gifts . " - Happy birthday , Jim ! - Thanks . Romulan ale ! Bones , you know this is illegal . I only use it for medicinal purposes . I got aboard a ship that brings in a case now and then across the Neutral Zone . - Now , don 't be a prig . - 2283 . Yeah , well , it takes this stuff a while to ferment . Here , give me that . Now , you open this one . I 'm almost afraid to . What is it ? Klingon aphrodisiacs ? No . Oh , Bones ... this is ... charming . 400 year old What is it For most patients your age , I recommend Retinax Five . - I 'm allergic to Retinax . - Exactly . Cheers ! Cheers . Happy birthday . - I don 't know what to say . - You could say thank you . Thank you . Damn it , Jim ! What 's the matter with you ? Why are we treating your birthday like a funeral ? - Bones , I don 't want to be lectured . - What the hell do you want ? This is not about age . And you know it . It 's about you flying a computer when you want to be hopping galaxies ! Spare me your notions of poetry . We all have our duties . Bull ! You 're hiding , hiding behind rules and regulations . - Who am I hiding from ? - From yourself , Admiral ! Don 't mince words , Bones . What do you really think ? Jim ... I 'm your doctor and I 'm your friend . Get back your command . Get it back before you turn into part of this collection . Before you really do grow old . Starship Log . Stardate 8130.4 . Log Entry by First Officer Pavel Chekov . Starship Reliant on orbital approach to Ceti Alpha Six , in connection with Project Genesis . We keep searching for a lifeless planet , to satisfy the requirements of a test site for the Genesis Experiment . So far , no success . Standard orbit , please . Mr Beach , any change in the surface scan ? Negative . Limited atmosphere dominated by craylon gas , sand , high velocity winds . Incapable of supporting lifeforms . Does it have to be completely lifeless ? You 've found something ? We 've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner . Damn . Are you sure ? Maybe the scanner 's out of adjustment . I suppose it could be a particle of pre-animate matter , caught in the matrix . All right . Get on the Comm-pic to Dr Marcus . Maybe it 's something we can transplant ? You know what she 'll say . Now , let me get this straight . Something you can transplant ? I don 't know . It may only be a particle of pre-animate matter . Then again , it may not . You boys have to be clear on this . There can 't be so much as a microbe , or the show 's off ! Have a look . But if it is something that can be moved ... You bet , Doctor . We 're on our way . Don 't have kittens , Genesis is going to work . They 'll remember you in one breath with Newton , Einstein , Surak ! Thanks a lot . No respect from my offspring . Par for the course . Are you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner ? Maybe . What is it ? Every time we have dealings with Starfleet , I get nervous . We are dealing with something that ... .. could be perverted into a dreadful weapon . That overgrown Boy Scout you used to know is exactly the kind of man ... Jim Kirk was many things , but he was never a Boy Scout ! Captain Terrell , stand by to beam down . Chekov , are you sure these are the correct coordinates ? Captain , this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha Six . I can barely see it . There 's nothing here ! The Tricorder must be broken . Chekov ! Over here ! Those look like cargo carriers . Hey , give me a hand . What the hell happened ? If they crashed , where 's the rest of the ship ? What the hell is that ? Botany Bay ... Botany Bay ? ! Oh , no ! We 've got to get out of here now ! Damn ! - What about the ... - Never mind that ! Hurry ! Chekov , what 's the matter with you ? Chekov ! Come on ! Hurry ! Starship Reliant to Captain Terrell . This is Commander Kyle . Will you please respond , Captain ? Captain Terrell ! Respond , please ! Let 's give them a little more time . Khan ! I don 't know you . But you ... I never forget a face . Mister ... .. Chekov ! Isn 't it ? I 'd never thought to see your face again . - Chekov , who is this man ? - A criminal , Captain . A product of late 20th century genetic engineering . - What do you want ? Sir , I demand ... - You are in a position to demand nothing , sir . I , on the other hand , am in a position to grant ... nothing . What you see is all that remains of the ship 's company and crew of the Botany Bay ... .. marooned here 15 years ago by Captain James T. Kirk . - Listen ! You men and women ... - Captain ! Captain ... Save your strength . These people have sworn to live and die at my command 200 years before you were born . Do you mean ... he never told you the tale ? To amuse your captain ? No ? Never told how the Enterprise picked up the Botany Bay , lost in space , in the year 1996 , myself and the ship 's company in cryogenic freeze ? - I 've never even met Admiral Kirk . - Admiral ? Admiral ? ! Admiral ... Never told you how ... Admiral Kirk sent 70 of us into exile on this barren sand heap , with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us ? You lie ! On Ceti Alpha Five there was life ! - A fair chance ! - This is Ceta Alpha Five ! Ceti Alpha Six exploded six months after we were left here . The shock shifted the orbit of this planet and everything was laid waste ! Admiral Kirk ... never bothered to check on our progress . It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that allowed us to survive . On Earth ... .. 200 years ago ... .. I was a prince ... .. with power over millions ! Captain Kirk was your host ! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him ! You didn 't expect to find me . You thought this was ... Ceti Alpha Six ! Why are you here ? Why ? ! Allow me to introduce you to Ceti Alpha Five 's only remaining indigenous lifeform . What do you think ? They 've killed 20 of my people . Including my beloved wife . Oh , not all at once . And not ... instantly , to be sure . You see , their young enter through the ears ... .. and wrap themselves around the cerebral cortex . This has the effect of rendering the victim extremely susceptible to suggestion . Later , as they ... grow ... .. follows madness . And death . Khan ! Listen to me ! These are pets , of course . Not quite domesticated . Khan ... Captain Kirk was only doing his duty . That 's better . Now , tell me ... Why are you here ? And tell me where I may find ... .. James Kirk . Enterprise to Admiral Kirk 's shuttle . You 're cleared for docking . Approach portside torpedo bay . Enterprise , this is Admiral Kirk 's party on final approach . Enterprise welcomes you . Prepare for docking . I hate inspections . I 'm delighted . Any chance to go aboard the Enterprise . I am glad to have you at the helm for three weeks . I don 't think these kids can steer . Open the airlock . - Permission to come aboard , Captain . - Welcome . You know my training crew . They certainly know you . Yes . We 've been through death and life together . Mr Scott , you old space dog ! You 're well ? I had a wee bout , sir , but Dr McCoy pulled me through . - A wee bout of what ? - Shore leave , Admiral . - And who is this ? - Midshipman First Class . - Peter Preston , engineer 's mate ! - First training voyage ? - Yes , sir ! - I see . Well ... shall we start with the Engine Room ? We 'll see you there . Everything is in order . That 'll be a pleasant surprise , Mr Scott . I 'll see you on the bridge , Admiral . Company dismissed ! . . Do you have idea Mr Peter Preston dos problemas que enfrentamos - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - . . . - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - Well , Mr Scott , are your cadets capable of handling a minor training cruise ? - Give the word , Admiral ! - Mr Scott , the word is given . Admiral , what about the rest of the inspection ? This is Starfleet Operations . Enterprise is cleared for departure . Admiral on the bridge . Very well , Mr Saavik . You may clear all moorings . - All moorings are clear , Captain . - Thank you . Lieutenant ? Have you ever piloted a Starship out of spacedock ? Never , sir . Take her out , Mr Saavik . Aye , sir . For everything there is a first time , Lieutenant . Don 't you agree , Admiral ? - Aft thrusters , Mr Sulu . - Aft thrusters . - Would you like a tranquilliser ? - Ahead one quarter impulse power . - We are free and clear to navigate . - Course heading , Captain ? Captain 's discretion . Mr Sulu ? You may ... indulge yourself . Aye , sir . That about do it ? There can 't be more information we could squeeze into the memory banks . - Next time we 'll design a bigger one . - Who 'd build it ? Dr Marcus ? Comm-Pic coming in on hyperchannel . - It 's the Starship Reliant . - On the screen , please , Jedda . Come in , please . This is the Reliant calling Regula One . Repeat , this is USS Reliant . Commander , we are receiving . This is Regula One . Go ahead . Dr Marcus . We 're en route to you and should be there in three days . En route ? Why ? We weren 't expecting you for another three months . - Has something happened ? - Ceti Alpha Six has checked out . - Then I don 't understand why you ... - We have received new orders . Upon our arrival at Regula One , all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for testing on Ceti Alpha Six . Who the hell do they think they are ? Commander Chekov , this is completely irregular . - I have my orders . - Pin him down , Mother ! Who gave the order ? The order comes from ... Admiral James T. Kirk . I knew it ! All along the military 's wanted to get ... This is completely improper , Commander Chekov ! I do not intend to allow Reliant or any other unauthorised personnel access to our work or materials . I 'm sorry that you feel that way . The Admiral 's orders are confirmed . Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival . Reliant out . Well done , Commander . You realise , sir , they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order . . . . . . . . . . Hold , please . Thank you , sir . Lieutenant , are you wearing your hair differently ? It 's still regulation , Admiral . May I speak , sir ? Self-expression doesn 't seem to be one of your problems . You 're bothered by your performance on the Kobayashi Maru . - I failed to resolve the situation . - It 's a test of character . May I ask how you dealt with the test ? You may ask . That 's a little joke . Humour . It is a difficult concept . - It is not logical . - We learn by doing . Who 's been holding up the damn elevator ? Thank you Sr ! - Did she change her hairstyle ? - I hadn 't noticed . Wonderful stuff , that Romulan ale . - Admiral Kirk ? - Kirk here . An urgent Comm-Pic from Space Lab Regula One for you . Dr Carol Marcus . - I 'll take it in my quarters , Uhura . - It never rains but it pours . As a physician , you should appreciate the dangers of re-opening old wounds . - Sorry . Jim , can you read me ? I can hear you , Carol . What 's the matter ? Why are you taking Genesis away from us ? Taking Genesis ? Who is taking Genesis ? - I can see you , but I can 't hear . - Carol ... - Jim , did you give the order ? - What order ? Who is taking Genesis ? Please help us ! I won 't let them have Genesis without authorisation ! On whose authority can they do this ? - No one 's authority ! - Please do something . - Uhura , what 's happening ? - Transmission jammed at source . Alert Starfleet Headquarters . I want to talk to Starfleet Command . We must have order in here . This has to be some sort of mistake . Mistake ? ! We 're all alone here . They waited until everyone was on leave to do this . Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal . - Starfleet clearly never intended ... - I know that , but ... I tried to tell you ! Scientists have always been pawns of the military . Starfleet has kept the peace for 100 years . I cannot subscribe to your interpretation of this event ! You may be right , Doctor . But what about Reliant ? She 's on her way . get you and were we going ? . Something may be wrong in Regula One . We 've been ordered to investigate . If memory serves , Regula One is a scientific research laboratory . I told Starfleet Command all we had was a boatload of children . But ... we 're the only ship in the quadrant . These cadets of yours , how will they respond under real pressure ? As with all living things , each according to his gifts . Of course , this ship is yours . No , that won 't be necessary . Just get me to Regula One . As a teacher on a training mission , I 'm happy to command the Enterprise . If we are to go on actual duty , the senior officer must assume command . It may be nothing . Garbled communications . You take the ship . You proceed from a false assumption . I 'm a Vulcan . I have no ego to bruise . You remind me that logic dictates your actions ? I would not remind you of that which you know so well . If I may be so bold , it was a mistake for you to accept promotion . Commanding a Starship is your first , best destiny . Anything else is a waste of material . I would not presume to debate you . That is wise . In any case ... were I to invoke logic , logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few . Or the one . You 're my superior officer . You are also my friend . I have been and always shall be yours . Stop energisers . Prepare speakers . An emergency situation has arisen . By order of Starfleet Command as of now , 1800 hours , I 'm assuming command of this vessel . Duty officer , so note in the log . Plot a new course for Space Laboratory Regula One . Engine Room . Mr Scott ! We 'll be going to Warp Speed . - Course plotted for Regula One . - Engage Warp engines . - Prepare for Warp Speed . - Ready , sir . I know that none of you were expecting this . I 'm sorry . I 'm going to have to ask you to grow up a little sooner than you expected . Warp Five , Sulu . So much for the little training cruise . Course to intercept Enterprise ready , sir . - Helmsman ? - Sir . May I speak ? We 're all with you , sir . But consider this . We are free . We have a ship and the means to go where we will . We have escaped permanent exile on Ceti Alpha Five . You have proved your superior intellect ... .. and defeated the plans of Admiral Kirk . You do not need to defeat him again . He tasks me . He tasks me , and I shall have him . I 'll chase him round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom and round perdition 's flames before I give him up ! Prepare to alter course . Space Station Regula One , please come in . Dr Marcus , please respond . This is Enterprise call ... There 's no response from Regula One . - But no longer jammed ? - No , sir . No nothing ! There are two possibilities . They 're unable or unwilling to respond . - How far ? - 12 hours 43 minutes , present speed . Give up Genesis , she said . What does that mean ? Give it up to whom ? It might help if I knew what Genesis was beyond the biblical reference . Uhura , have Dr McCoy join us in my quarters . Mr Saavik ? You have the con . I 've got Sick Bay ready . Will someone please tell me what 's going on ? Computer . Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis summary . Identify for retina scan . Kirk ... Admiral James T. Security Scan approved . Summary , please ? Project Genesis . A proposal to the Federation . - Carol Marcus . - Yes . What ex actly is Genesis ? Well , put simply , Genesis is life from lifelessness . It is a process whereby molecular structure is reorganised at the sub-atomic level into life - generating matter of equal mass . Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the laboratory . Stage Two will be attempted in a lifeless underground . Stage Three will involve the process on a planetary scale . It is our intention to introduce the Genesis device into a pre-selected area of a lifeless space body , such as a moon . The device is delivered , instantaneously causing what we call the Genesis Effect . Matter is reorganised with life-generating results . Instead of a dead moon , a living , breathing planet capable of sustaining whatever lifeforms we deposit on it . Fascinating . The moon simulated here represents a fraction of Genesis ' potential should the Federation wish to fund the experiment to its conclusion . When we consider the cosmic problems of population and food supply , the usefulness of this process becomes clear . This concludes our proposal . Thank you for your attention . It literally is Genesis . The power of creation . - Have they proceeded ? - The tape was made a year ago . I can only assume they 've reached Stage Two by now . But , dear Lord , do you think we 're intelligent enough to ... Suppose ... What if this thing were used where life already exists ? It would destroy such life ... in favour of its new matrix . Its new matrix ? Do you have any idea what you 're saying ? I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications . In cosmic history it has always been easier to destroy than to create . Not any more ! Now we can do both at the same time . According to myth , Earth was created in six days . Now watch out ! Here comes Genesis ! We 'll do it for you in six minutes ! - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - Gentleman Really , Dr McCoy , you must learn to govern your passions . They will be your undoing . Logic suggests ... Logic ? ! My God , the man 's talking about logic ! We 're talking about universal Armageddon ! - You green-blooded , inhuman ... - Bridge to Admiral Kirk . Sensors indicate a vessel in our area , closing fast . - What do you make of her ? - It 's one of ours . It 's Reliant . Try the emergency channels . Picture , Mr Saavik . Slow to one-half impulse power . - Let 's be friends . - Slowing to one-half impulse power . Reliant in our section . This quadrant , sir . And slowing . Sir ? May I quote General Order 12 ? " On the approach of any vessel , " when communications have not been established ... " The Admiral is well aware of the regulations . Aye , sir . Is it possible their Comm system has failed ? It would explain many things . They 're requesting communications , sir . Let them eat static ! They 're still running with shields down . Of course ! We are one big happy fleet ! Ah , Kirk , my old friend ! Do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us , " Revenge is a dish that is best served cold ? " It is very cold ... in space . This is damned peculiar . - Yellow Alert ! - Energise defence fields ! A voice message . They say their Chambers coil is overloading their Comm system . - Spock ? Scanning . Their coil emissions are normal ! - Their shields are still down . - Raise ours . - Their shields are going up ! - Lock phasers on target . Locking phasers on target . - They 're locking phasers . - Raise shields . Fire ! - Sulu , get those shields up ! - Trying , sir . I can 't get power , sir ! Scotty ? - Uhura , turn off those channels ! - Mr Scott on the screen . We 're just hanging on , sir ! The main energiser 's out ! - Try auxiliary power ! - Aye , sir . Damage report . - They knew exactly where to hit us . - Who knew where to hit us ? And why ? One thing is certain . We cannot escape on auxiliary power . Visual ! - Sulu , divert all power to phasers . - Too late . Hang on ! Scotty ! What 's left ? Just the batteries ! I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes ! We don 't have a few minutes ! - Can you give me phaser power ? - A few shots ! - Not enough against their shields . - Who are they ? Admiral ! The commander of the Reliant is signalling ! He wishes to discuss terms of our surrender . Visual on screen . Do it ! While we still have time . On screen , sir . - Khan ! - You still remember , Admiral . I cannot help but be touched . I , of course , remember you ! What is the meaning of this attack ? ! Where is the crew of the Reliant ? Surely I have made my meaning plain . I mean to avenge myself upon you , Admiral . I 've deprived your ship of power and will deprive you of your life ! But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you . Khan ... If it 's me you want ... .. l 'll have myself beamed aboard . Spare my crew ! I make you a counter-proposal . I 'll agree to your terms if ... .. if ... in addition to yourself , you hand over to me all data and material regarding the project called ... Genesis . - Genesis ? What 's that ? - Don 't insult my intelligence . Give me some time to recall the data on our computers . I give you 60 seconds , Admiral . Clear the bridge . At least we know he doesn 't have Genesis . Keep nodding as though I 'm still giving orders . Mr Saavik , punch up the data charts of Reliant 's command console . - Hurry ! - 45 seconds . The prefix code ? - The chart 's up , sir . - Admiral ! We 're finding it . - Admiral ! - Please . Please , give us time . The bridge is smashed , the computers inoperative . Time is a luxury you don 't have , Admiral . Damn ! - Admiral ? - It 's coming through now , Khan . Reliant 's prefix number is 16309 . I don 't understand . You have to learn why things work on a Starship . Each ship has its own combination code . To prevent an enemy from doing what we 're attempting . Using our console to order Reliant to lower her shields . Assuming he hasn 't changed the combination . Fifteen seconds . Khan , how do we know you 'll keep your word ? I 've given you no word to keep , Admiral . In my judgment , you simply have no alternative . I see your point . Stand by to receive our transmission . Mr Sulu , lock phasers on target and await my command . Time 's up ... Admiral . Here it comes . Now , Mr Spock . Sir ! Our shields are dropping ! Raise them ! I can 't ! Where 's the override ? ! Fire ! Fire ! Fire ! Fire ! - We can 't fire ! - Why can 't you ? They 've damaged the photon control and the Warp Drive . We must withdraw . - No ! No ! - Sir , we must ! The Enterprise can wait ! She 's not going anywhere ! - Sir , you did it ! - I did nothing ! Except get caught with my breeches down . I must be getting senile . Mr Saavik ? You go right on quoting regulations ! In the meantime , let 's find out how badly we 've been hurt . - Is the word given , Admiral ? - The word is given . Warp Speed . Aye . - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - He stayed at his post ... when the trainees ran ! - Admiral ? This is Spock . - Yes , Spock ? Engine Room reports auxiliary power restored . We can proceed at impulse power . Best speed to Regula One . Kirk out . - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula One . Space Station Regula One , this is the Starship Enterprise . Come in . Space Station Regula One , do you read ? Space Station Regula One , this is Enterprise . Please acknowledge . This is Enterprise . Do you read me ? Space Station Regula One , do you read ? Please come in . There 's no response , sir . Sensors , Captain ? Still inoperative . There 's no way to ascertain what 's inside the station . No way of telling if Reliant is still in the area . What do you make of that planetoid beyond ? Regula is class ' D ' . It consists of various unremarkable ores . Essentially a great rock in space . - Reliant could be behind the rock . A distinct possibility . - Engineering ? - Aye , sir . Mr Scott ? Do you have enough power for transporters ? Barely , sir . - I 'm going down there . - Khan could be there ! He 's been there , hasn 't found what he wants . Who can you spare ? I can spare me . Begging your pardon . General Order 15 : " No flag officer shall beam " into a hazardous area without armed escort . " There 's no such regulation ! All right , join the party . Mr Spock , the ship is yours . Jim , be careful . We will ! Indeterminate life signs . Phasers on stun . Move out . Jim ! Rigor hasn 't set in . This couldn 't have happened too long ago . Carol ... ! Enterprise calling Space Lab Regula One . Respond , please . Admiral ! Over here . Dr Marcus , come in , please ! Oh , my God ! Please acknowledge signal ! Please ... This is Lieutenant Saavik . We 're all right . Please stand by . Oh , sir ! It was Khan ! - We found him on Ceti Alpha Five . - Easy ... He ... put ... creatures in our bodies ! To control our minds ! It 's all right . You 're safe now . Made us say lies ... do things . But we beat him . He thought he controlled us , but he did not ! - The Captain was strong . - Captain ... Where 's Dr Marcus ? Where are the Genesis materials ? He couldn 't find them . Even the data banks were empty . - Erased ? He tortured those people . But none of them would tell him anything . He went wild . He slit their throats . He wanted to tear the place apart . But he was late . He had to get back to Reliant to blow you to bits ! Where 's Reliant 's crew ? Dead ? Marooned on Ceti Alpha Five . He 's mad . He blames you for the death of his wife . I know what he blames me for . The escape pods are all in place . Where 's the Transporter Room ? - Did he make it down here ? - It was not my impression . He spent most of the time trying to wring information out of the people . The unit 's been left on . This means nobody remained to turn it off . Those people bought escape time for Genesis with their lives . This is not logical . These coordinates are deep inside Regula . A planetoid we know to be lifeless . If Stage Two was completed , it was going to be underground . - Underground , she said ! - Stage Two of what ? - Kirk to Enterprise . - Spock here . Captain Spock , damage report . If we go by the book , like Saavik , hours could seem like days . - Let 's have it , Captain . - The situation is grave . We won 't have main power for six days . Auxiliary power has temporarily failed . Restoration may be possible in two days ... by the book , Admiral . - You can 't even beam us back ? - Not at present . Captain Spock . If you don 't hear from us within one hour , your orders are to restore what power you can , take the Enterprise to the nearest Starbase and alert Starfleet Command when out of jamming range . Sir , we won 't leave you behind ! Uhura , if you don 't hear from us , there won 't be anybody behind . Gentlemen , you can stay here , or ... If it 's all the same , Admiral , we 'd like to share the risk . Right . Let 's go . Saavik . - Go ? Where are we going ? - Where they went . Suppose they went nowhere ? Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all . Admiral ... Genesis , I presume . Phasers down ! You ! - Where 's Dr Marcus ? - I 'm Dr Marcus ! Jim ! Is that David ? Mother ! He killed everybody we left behind . Of course he didn 't . David , you 're just making this harder . I 'm afraid it 's even harder than you think , Doctor . Please don 't move . Chekov ! I 'm ... sorry , Admiral . Your Excellency , have you been listening ? I have indeed , Captain . You have done well . I knew it ! You son-of-a bitch ! - Don 't move ! Anybody ! - Captain ? We are waiting . - What 's the delay ? - All is well , sir . You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis . First things first , Captain . Kill Admiral Kirk . Sir , that is difficult . I ... - I try to obey , but ... - Kill him ! I ... Kill him , Terrell , now ! God 's sakes ! What is it ? Khan , you bloodsucker ! You 're gonna have to do your own dirty work now ! Do you hear me ? Kirk ! Kirk , you 're still alive , my old friend . Still , " old friend " You 've managed to kill just about everyone else , but like a poor marksman , you keep missing the target . Perhaps I no longer need to try , Admiral . He can 't take it ! Khan ! You 've got Genesis , but you don 't have me ! You were going to kill me , Khan ! You 're going to have to come here ! I 've done far worse than kill you . I 've hurt you . And I wish to go on ... hurting you . I shall leave you as you left me . As you left her . Marooned for all eternity , in the centre of a dead planet . Buried alive ! Buried alive ! - Khan ! This is Lieutenant Saavik calling Enterprise . Can you read us ? This is Lieutenant Saavik calling Enterprise . Can you read us ? - He 's coming around . - Pavel ? It 's no use , Admiral . They 're still jamming all channels . If Enterprise followed orders , she 's gone . If she couldn 't obey , she 's finished . So are we , it looks like . I don 't understand ! Who 's responsible for all this ? Who is Khan ? - It 's a long story . - We appear to have plenty of time . Is there anything to eat ? I don 't know about you , but I 'm starved . How can you think of food now ? First order of business . Survival . There is food in the Genesis cave . Enough to last a lifetime ... if necessary . We thought this was Genesis . It took the Starfleet Corps of Engineers ten months in spacesuits to tunnel out all this . What we did in there , we did in a day . David , why don 't you show Dr McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food ? - We can 't just sit here ! - Oh , yes , we can . This is just to give us something to do , isn 't it ? Come on . - Admiral ? As your teacher , Mr Spock , says , " I like to think that there always are ... possibilities . " I did what you wanted . I stayed away . Why didn 't you tell him ? How can you ask me that ? Were we together ? Were we going to be ? You had your world and I had mine . And I wanted him in mine . Not chasing through the universe with his father ! Actually ... he 's a lot like you . In many ways . Please tell me what you 're feeling . There 's a man out there I haven 't seen in 15 years , who 's trying to kill me . You show me a son that 'd be happy to help him . My son ... My life that could have been ... .. and wasn 't . And what am I feeling ? Old . Worn out . Let me show you something ... .. that 'll make you feel young , as when the world was new . Impulse power restored . Excellent . More than a match for poor Enterprise . You did all this in a day ? The matrix formed in a day . The lifeforms grew later , at a substantially accelerated rate . Jim ! This is fantastic ! Have you ever seen the like ? Can I cook or can 't I ? Where is she ? Sir ? May I ask you a question ? - What 's on your mind , Lieutenant ? - The Kobayashi Maru . Are you asking if this is that scenario ? On the test , will you tell me what you did ? I would really like to know . Lieutenant , you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario . How ? I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship . - What ? - He cheated ! I changed the conditions of the test . I got a commendation for original thinking . I don 't like to lose . Then you never faced that situation ... faced death ? I don 't believe in a no-win scenario . - Spock . It 's two hours . Ready ? - Right on schedule . Just give us your coordinates and we 'll beam you aboard . I don 't like to lose . But we were immobilised . Captain Spock said it 'd be two days . Lieutenant , you of all people go by the book . Spock ! - You know Dr Marcus . - Of course . - I 'm taking this bunch to Sick Bay . - By the book ? Regulation 46A . " If transmissions are monitored during battle ... " .. no uncoded messages on an open channel . " - You lied . - I exaggerated . Hours instead of days . Now we have minutes instead of hours . - Inoperative below C-Deck . - What is working ? We have partial main power . Best we could do in two hours . - Admiral on the bridge . - Battle stations ! Tactical ! She can still outrun us ... and outgun us . - But there is the Mutara Nebula . - Scotty , can we make it inside ? The energiser 's bypassed , so don 't give me too many bumps . - No promises . On your way . - Trouble with the nebula is all that static discharge and gas clouds our tactical display . Visual won 't function and shields will be useless . Sauce for the goose , Mr Saavik . The odds will be even . There she is ! There she is ! Not so wounded as we were led to believe . So much the better . Estimating nebula penetration in 2.2 minutes . Reliant is closing . If they go in there , we 'll lose them . Explain it to them . - That was close . They don 't want us going in there . - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - One minute to nebula perimeter . Why are we slowing ? We daren 't follow them into the nebula . Our shields would be useless . - They are reducing speed . - Uhura , patch me in . You 're on , Admiral . Admiral Kirk here . We tried it your way , Khan . Game for a rematch ? Khan ! I 'm laughing at the " superior intellect " . - Full impulse power . - No , sir ! You have Genesis . You can have whatever ... Full power ! Damn you ! I 'll say this for him , he 's consistent . We are now entering the Mutara Nebula . Emergency lights . Tactical . Inoperative . Raise the shields . As I feared , sir , not functional . I 'm reducing speed . Target , sir . - Phaser lock inoperative . - Best guess , Sulu . Fire when ready . Aft torpedoes ! Fire ! Hold your course . Evasive starboard ! Fire ! Damage , Mr Scott ? Admiral , I 've got to take the mains off the line . - The radiation ... - Scotty ? ! Joachim ! Yours ... is the ... superior ... I shall avenge you ! Could you use another hand , Admiral ? Man the weapons console , Mr Chekov . - Spock . - Sporadic energy readings . Port side , aft . Could be an impulse turn . He won 't break off now . He followed me this far , he 'll be back . But from where ? He 's intelligent , but not experienced . His pattern indicates two-dimensional thinking . - Full stop . - Full stop , sir . Z-minus 10,000 metres . Stand by photon torpedoes . Torpedoes ready , sir . Look sharp . Fire ! Fire ! Uhura , send to Commander , Reliant : " Prepare to be boarded . " Aye , sir . Commander , Reliant , this is Enterprise . Surrender and prepare to be boarded . Enterprise to Reliant . You are ordered to surrender your vessel . Reliant ! Come in , Reliant . You are ordered to surrender your vessel . Enterprise to Reliant . You 're ordered to surrender your vessel . Respond . No , Kirk . The game 's not over . To the last ... I will grapple with thee ! commit Admiral ? Scanning an energy source on Reliant . A pattern I 've never seen before . - It 's the Genesis Wave ! - What ? They 're on a build-up to detonation ! - How soon ? - We encoded four minutes . - We 'll beam aboard and stop it . - You can 't . Scotty ! I need Warp Speed in three minutes , or we 're all dead . - No response , Admiral . - Scotty ! Mr Sulu , get us out of here . Best possible speed . Are you out of your Vulcan mind ? ! No human can tolerate that radiation ! As you are so fond of observing , Doctor , I am not human . - You 're not going in there ! - Perhaps you 're right . - What is Mr Scott 's condition ? - Well , I don 't think that he ... I 'm sorry , Doctor , I have no time to discuss this logically . Remember . Spock ! Get out of there ! Spock ! Spock ! Get out of there ! - Time from my mark ? - Two minutes ten seconds . Engine Room ! What 's happening ? - Spock ! - You dumb ninny ! Get out of there ! No ! God , don 't ! Time ? Three minutes , 30 seconds . - Distance from Reliant ? - 4,000 kilometres . We 're not going to make it , are we ? No ! No ! You can 't get away ! From hell 's heart , I stab at thee ! For hate 's sake , I spit my last breath ... at thee ! - Sir ! The mains are back on line ! - Bless you , Scotty . Go , Sulu ! My God , Carol . Look at it . Engine Room ? Well done , Scotty . Jim ! I think you 'd better get down here . - Bones ? - Better hurry . Saavik , take the con . No ! You 'll flood the whole compartment ! - He 'll die ! - Sir ! He 's dead already . It 's too late , Jim . Spock ! Ship ... out of danger ? Yes . Don 't grieve , Admiral . It is logical . The needs of the many ... outweigh ... .. the needs of the few . Or the one . I never took ... the Kobayashi Maru test . Until now . What do you think of my solution ? Spock ... ! I have been ... .. and always shall be ... .. your friend . Live long ... and prosper ! No ! We are assembled here today . to pay final respects to our honoured dead . And yet it should be noted that , in the midst of our sorrow , this death takes place in the shadow of new life . The sunrise of a new world . A world that our beloved comrade gave his life to protect and nourish . He did not feel his sacrifice a vain or empty one . And we will not debate his profound wisdom at these proceedings . Of my friend , I can only say this ... Of all the souls I have encountered in my travels ... .. his was the most ... .. human . Honours ... hup ! Come . I don 't mean to intrude . No , not at all . I should be on the bridge . - Can I talk to you for a minute ? - Would you like a drink ? Lieutenant Saavik was right . You never have faced a death . No , not like this . - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida - - Legenda não traduzida -

 Can 't we go up just a little ? I can 't . The Russians would pick us up on radar . My orders are to get you out . You would separate a man from his family ? Hey , I 'm not running a shuttle bus service . The odds are 50-50 that Hawke is flying Airwolf into a trap . Hawke doesn 't know the odds . Nyet . You may be his only hope for escape . So you have other options ? Of course . We could always invade Russia . Moses will make his way to that hunting cabin . It 's in a remote section of the Urals , about 90 kilometers east of Sverdlovsk . Marella will give you precise coordinates for Airwolf 's computer . Moses ? If you 'd read the dossier , Stringfellow , instead of just looking at all the pretty pictures , you would know that Vladimir Rostoff 's code name is Moses . Cute . Thank you . I don 't think either of you realizes the seriousness of the situation . Yes , sir . If Moses has blown his cover after 22 years , it has to be for something big . He 's risen higher than we 'd dared hope . Kept us out of at least a dozen small wars , and maybe , on a couple of occasions , the big one . And now , he 's thrown all that away and whatever it 's worth so , you can bet it has to be for something damn important . Who 's this ? Natalya and Tanya Rostoff . So , he 's got a family ? He 's been there 22 years . I assume you 've got a refueling tanker somewhere over the Norwegian basin . Yes . That 's still a 3,000-mile round trip through Russian airspace . Airwolf can make it , but not with 5 people . She can if you strip the armament . You 're asking me to fly Airwolf into Russia without any guns ? It 's the only way . It 's not exactly like pulling a mole out of Indian territory . I told you . He 's got something big or he wouldn 't be coming out . Rostoff is no ordinary agent . On his first assignment he was decorated for saving the life of a fellow agent when the mission went sour . Marella . That agent 's name is Michael Goldsmith Briggs III . Code named ... Archangel . That has nothing to do with it . Of course not . Will you take the mission ? " The Third , " ? I wouldn 't throw stones , Stringfellow . Sir , could I play devil 's advocate for a moment ? I encourage it . Well , some of our sister agencies suspect that we 're in liaison with Hawke and Airwolf They haven 't been able to prove it . No , sir . But you can be sure that if they suspect , so do the Russians . And that this might possibly be an elaborate effort by the Soviets to capture Airwolf Anything is possible , but it 's not very probable . I agree , unless one of 2 things has happened . 1 - the Soviets have uncovered Moses and are using him . Giving him something that he thinks is so important he 's got to bring us in to extract him . No . If the KGB uncovered him , they wouldn 't risk his slipping away in a ruse to capture Airwolf 2 - he 's been living in Russia for over 20 years . He 's got a wife , daughter , friends . He may have turned . I didn 't say you would like it . I think it stinks . Yes , sir . I assume you 've run these scenarios of yours through the computer ? Yes , sir . I took the statistics from all our counterintelligence agencies , both foreign and domestic , who operate deep undercover agents . I cross-referenced them with those that have turned and added the psychological probability of change due to midlife crisis , sexual promiscuity , children reaching ... Damn it , Marella , what 's the bottom line ? The odds are 50-50 that Hawke is flying Airwolf into a trap . It 's the stupidest plan I ever heard . Some Russky out hunting bear with a bow and arrow could bring us down . They 'd better have armor-piercing arrows . Oh , you know what I mean . Yeah . You don 't like the plan . I think it stinks . You got a better one ? You bet . Let 's not go at all . No matter how many times I see her , she still takes my breath away . $ 10 it 's an SR-71 . Harrier Jet . What the hell would we be doing refueling a Harrier within spitting distance of Russia ? I don 't know the mission . I just know it 's a Harrier . Why else would we be using a straight line refueling rig ? An SR-71 uses a straight line refueling rig . I didn 't know that . That 's why you 're gonna lose $ 10 . Captain , I ... I ... I have an ... an aircraft approaching for hookup . What is it ? I 'd rather not say , sir . According to the computer , we 'll be penetrating Soviet airspace in 6 minutes . Right . That 's all you got to say ? For now . We 're going on the deck the rest of the way . I was afraid it 'd be something like that . What do you call " on the deck " ? About 50 feet . Give or take a few . It ain 't the 50 feet I 'm worried about . It 's the give or take . I got 2 bogies , Angels 30 . Closing fast on a heading of 015 . MiGs ? MiG 23s . Hey , I thought this was Finland . I don 't think the Soviets pay too much attention to road signs around their borders . Hang on . They 're directly overhead . Altitude ? Angels 30 . I 'm absorbing 90 % of their radar scans . They 're maintaining altitude . Heading northeast . Hey , I don 't think they spotted us , String . When the sun goes down here , it really goes down , huh ? It comes up just as fast . We have about 8 hours this time of the year . 3 in , 3 out , and 2 to pick Moses up . Maybe less . Those MiGs are descending and coming back . Now , why would they do a thing like that ? Well , Dom , they might 've spotted us . They 're climbing . I think they lost us . Oh , my God , nobody can fly blind this low . I know . Then pull up . I can 't . The Russians would pick us up on radar . It 's better than in little pieces . Oh , String , this is nuts . Those MiGs gone ? Yeah , moving off the grid to the north . Tum on my helmet view . It 's the CC panel . Mamma mia ! What is that ? SLAS . StarLight Amplification System . It amplifies available light a million times . Turns night into day . Oh , that 's great , String . But now that the MiGs are gone , can 't we go up just a little ? Yeah , I guess we can ease up a few feet . Thank you . Well , if they haven 't snagged a snowdrift or been run over by a herd of reindeer , they should be approaching that cabin just about now . Then one way or another we should know what 's happening soon . We won 't , but they will . Knightsbridge , this is Angel 1 . I 'm 5 miles out over the main gate . Request a Jericho approach to the pad . Angel 1 , Knightsbridge . Approach approved . You are cleared to land . According to the computer , we 're within 10 kilometers of the cabin . No , wait . You better slow down . We 're 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... String , I got a heat source at 3 o 'clock 100 meters up . Could be human . Hit the lights . Invite him into the clearing . Right . Hey , see if you can get him to look up , will you ? I said get him to look up , not scare the hell out of me . Sorry . Is it him ? A little older , but it 's him . You got any other heat sources ? Nope . That 's too bad . Why , you looking for trouble ? No . But if Rostoff 's bringing his family out , there ought to be 2 other heat sources somewhere in the area . Rostoff ? I came to take you home , Moses . I thought you were Soviet military . Why , are they hunting you ? I must assume so . They may have deduced by now it was no accident . What ? I 've been without sleep for 3 days . My thinking is a bit muddled . I stole a biological weapon and covered the theft by creating an accident , a fatal accident . Some of them were my friends . It must be some weapon . It is . Air carried . Lethal in 2 seconds . Totally undetectable and untraceable . The only deterrent is for both sides to have it then each will fear retaliation . Archangel was right . You are an exceptional man . How is Michael ? Oh , he 's a little the worse for wear but he 's still recruiting the most beautiful and intelligent women in the world . I used to think that would be his downfall . Now I think it may be his strength . We gotta get going . Yes , of course . Where is your family ? They 're waiting at Kirivitz , 200 kilometers east of here . Hey , I 'm not running a shuttle bus service . I didn 't know how long it would take the Firm to extract me . I couldn 't risk my family being caught here with me . My orders are to get you out . You would separate a man from his family ? If I had to . Yes . That 's why I left the serum I stole with my wife . Your helicopter , it 's incredible . Mach 1 plus . We have nothing like this . What do you mean " we " ? I mean the Soviets . IR jamming . Automatic defense system . Stealth mode . A choice of 14 offensive weapons . We wish . We had to strip the guns to ... Dom . Have you got that readout on Kirivitz ? Of course . You had to trade weight for fuel . You have nothing to shoot with , do you ? I always save a little something . Kirivitz . Agra community . 1,200 people . 62 degrees north , 51 degrees west . My family will be at my wife 's brother 's farm , north of the village . Hey , String . There 's a Soviet missile complex all around Kirivitz . It 's gotta have more security than Fort Knox . The missiles were removed 3 months ago . Those silos are empty and so are the barracks . It 's part of the air defense rotation program . Yeah , but that 's not what the computer says . Then the computer is wrong . Archangel gave us the latest tapes for this mission . Then there is obviously an intelligence lag . Or you 're lying . We are how far from the farmhouse ? 10,000 meters . Amazing . I count 5 people . My family and Turgyev 's wife and son . What do you think , Dom ? Why ask me now ? I don 't think we should 've have taken this job in the first place . I think we should have gone home from the cabin . And I think we 're walking right into a trap . And I think that you 're gonna do whatever you 're gonna do no matter what I think . So why you asking me what I think ? Hey , sorry . There is a missile silo a mile to the west and another a mile and a half south . They 're both connected to the road that 's in front of the farm . As I said , they are empty , so , you can take your pick . Dom ? Now , let 's see . I 've got a small clearing , big enough , but not too big . There 's a creek that runs through it to the farm about 1,500 meters on a heading of 215 . Okay . Nice , huh ? Turgyev has a great voice . He used to sing in the army choir . Kind of catchy . Where 've I heard that before ? It 's a song of bloodshed , of struggle , of glory . A song of the Revolution . Revolu ... Oh , now I remember . You mean I 've been humming a Communist song ? Think of it as a Russian version of Yankee Doodle Dandy . Hey , hold on a minute , let 's have a look . Just your family , huh ? Turgyev 's in the local militia . They must be his friends . Oh , really ? Probably on a routine patrol checking the empty missile silos . To guard against vandalism . With AK-47s ? - I 'll get rid of them . - No . You yourself said we were on a tight schedule . Did you ever think that maybe your accident has been discovered and they 're here to pick you up ? They don 't send the local militia for that , Mr. Hawke . Hey . Shoot me and you lose the serum . And you lose your life . The 1800 situation report is in . Well ? There 's unusual Soviet air activity near the Manchurian border . Over 2,000 miles from Airwolf . A satellite was launched at 1200 Zulu time from their space center at Baikonur . Orbit ? North-south elliptical , covering England , France , Italy . They 're beefing up their M.R. missile spotting network . Armored activity near Polish border . There was a work stoppage at Lodz yesterday . The Russians are just flexing their muscles . And the rest was on the 1200 report . What is it ? An update in the communication section . " increased radio traffic on KGB frequencies " " throughout the central Urals . " " Specifically in the Sverdlovsk area . " It 's beginning to look like you could be right . Hmm , beautiful . Sounds like one of them sad Italian arias . It 's a song about a young couple who die of unrequited love . Romeo and Juliet . This was sung on the steppes of Russia long before Shakespeare was born . He probably stole the idea from us . There you go with that " us " again . I am Russian , Mr. Santini . I thought you were an American . I was born in a coal-mining town in Pennsylvania , of Russian parents . I was rocked to sleep to Russian lullabies . I celebrated Christmas on January 5 . Prayed to God in a Russian Orthodox church . And when I fell in love , it was with a Russian girl . I am American by birth and political conviction . But my heart and soul is Russian . Hey , enough of this . Rostoff , we don 't have time for this . You should have told your daughter earlier . Yes . You should have . Hey , she speaks English . And French and Italian . We are not ignorant . Excuse me . If you speak English , speak English . Nyet ! I don 't think she likes us , String . Neither do I. In your place I wouldn 't like us much , either . But the reality is , your husband has to leave Russia or he 's gonna be shot . Nyet . Da . English , please . My brother does not speak English . Then he 's excused . The rest of you aren 't . Have you got that serum ? In the bedroom . Hold on a minute . You say your brother-in-law 's in the militia , where does he keep his gun ? Also in the bedroom . Dom . Yeah , sure . Tanya , I like your spunk but if you don 't start speaking English I 'm gonna spank your butt . Stop it , Tanya . I 'm doing what I feel I must . Not for America , for people . For Russians and Americans . By betraying our country ? It 's not a simple matter of betrayal . It seems simple to me . That 's because you are young and naive . Perhaps . But I am old enough to know that I will not betray my country . Nor I mine . But Russia is your country . No , Tanya . Russia is my heritage . The United States is my country and I took an oath to protect it , even if it cost me my life . I suppose it 's just the local militia dropping by for some tea ? They know the lab was not an accident . Is it Russian ? Never mind . We can try for your helicopter if one of us decoys them . Do not move or I will shoot . On the count of 3 , douse that light . And you get that lamp . And then hide behind that stove . - You ready ? - Da . 1 ... 2 ... 3 ... Anybody hit ? No . Don 't shoot . If my reflexes were just a little faster , you 'd have been a dead bunny . I was counting on that . T ... Turgyev ? He 's okay . Took off toward the road , I think . What is it ? Get down ! He 's not trying to kill us . Yeah ? You couldn 't prove it by me . No , he 's shooting high . Or trying to keep us pinned down till they get ground support . We 'll have to decoy him to get out of here . I will do it if you will get my family out . No , Papa . No ! We will not go without you . Nyet ! Nyet . Hey , Moses , I don 't know what they 're saying , but it sounds like " no " to me . I 'm not gonna haul 2 screaming , kicking women through the woods in the dark . Not when there 's another way . What other way ? Hey , she ain 't got no guns , remember ? And in case you hadn 't noticed , he does . Yeah , well , I figure that 'll just about make it even . Do you want something to eat ? What ? Can I get you a sandwich or some hot soup ? I could send to ... Oh , no , no , thank you , no . Oh , not yet , please , Marella . I wanna enjoy the sunset . I 'm sorry . For what ? For being right . Don 't write this mission off yet . But it 's sunrise over the Urals . Hawke was supposed to rendezvous with the tanker 15 minutes ago . That doesn 't mean he 's failed . Just that he 's late . Sir , if I were to put this mission through my computer right now , the odds would be a 1,000-to-1 against it . Probably higher . But we 've got one thing going for us . What ? Hawke doesn 't know the odds . He must hate me . Who , Turgyev ? No . Not the way he greeted you last night . Oh , he ... he may be hurt and angry . But given time , he 'll remember all the good things between you . You say you sang together ? All the time . Our families used to say we drove them crazy , but they loved it . Especially the children . He 'll remember . You 're a philosopher , Mr. Santini . Me ? No . I 've just lived a little . And I 'd like to continue . I wonder what the hell he 's up to . It is over . No , we ain 't finished yet . At least he got out with the serum . What are you talking about ? Hawke ? Of course . He did what he had to do , get the serum back . Yeah , well , you don 't know Hawke . I 'm gonna teach you to sit up there and make life miserable . Who needs guns ? Get in ! Get in ! I still can 't figure Sergeant Tembrusco . He 's flown on and off as my crew chief for 5 years . I 've never seen him act so weird before . Maybe that 's why . I don 't follow you . Well , he knows it 's a Harrier . He just didn 't want you to lose the bet . It was not a Harrier . It was an SR-71 . Then why didn 't Tembrusco say so ? I don 't know . Something 's wrong . This is the first flight he 's missed since ... Captain Nuzo , I have an aircraft approaching for hookup . Same bet ? You 're on . Airman , what 's your name , son ? Airman Munga , sir . What kind of aircraft is that , Munga ? Type , sir ? That 's right , Airman . What type ? It 's a helicopter , sir . Where 'd you get this guy ? I was wrong . What ? 0600 Zulu . Aircraft linkup with refueling tanker Tango over the Norwegian basin 0547 confirmed . Hawke did it ! Yeah , try to control yourself . Yes , sir . You 're acting like a trainee on her first mission instead of ... He did it ! All right . I haven 't had halupkis since I was a kid . And my friend Milo 's Mom , they were Russian , too , she made it for me . A ... and then there was a special soup that she used to make for Christmas . With , pasta and , little meatballs . I never heard of that . Well , maybe that was Ling Soo 's Mom . They were Chinese , you know . So , tell me , Mr. Rostoff , what was Michael like in the early days ? " Early days " ? You make me sound ancient . Michael , you do look a little the worse for wear . All earned in the line of duty . Tanya ? Give her time , Vlad . Well , you haven 't answered my question . Thank you . Excuse me . Well , in the beginning , Michael was a bit of a womanizer . What ? Do you ... have you made any plans ? Now that you 're back in the United States ... Kind of pretty , huh ? It is not so beautiful as Russia . Yeah . From what I saw , that was a really beautiful country . Not commercial like United States . I guess you 'll be going back . Of course . Just as soon as Mama and Papa ... I will never give up Russia . Never . Nobody is asking you to , Tanya . You can 't give up what 's in your heart . You mean I will not be forced to become American ? Well , I 'm sure there 'll be a lot of people who 'll try to Americanize you . That 's only natural . You might even find out some things about this country you like . Like what ? I don 't know . Music , books , films , fast food . But most of all , the freedom to accept or reject our culture or our politics as you see fit . Prove it . That 's something you 'll have to find out for yourself .

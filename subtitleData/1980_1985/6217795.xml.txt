 Huh ? Is that good or is that good ? What do you think ? Well , why don 't you put the whole thing in your mouth ? The whole thing ? Well , you can 't just nibble at it . You have to look like you 're enjoying it . Is that camera on ? The camera is on . You 're on . Okay ? Oh , God ! Okay . Ooh ! Isn 't that delicious ? Huh ? Just enjoy the heck out of it . I can 't smile . It 's stuck in my teeth . Ma 'am , you can 't grimace like that because the crackers are flying out of your mouth . That 's not gonna work . Okay ? I gotta have something to drink . Okay , take a drink and let me put some more Cheese Tease on the cracker and now put it in the mouth . Oh ! Oh , man . Oh , I 'm sorry . I got some on your blouse . Don 't worry about it . Send me the bill . Send me the bill . What 's in it ? The camera 's running ! If I don 't love it , I don 't get to do the commercial , right ? That 's right . I don 't love it . Well , then , thank you . Have a nice day . Yeah , with this stuff eating a hole in my blouse ? Uh-huh . In a few minutes , what we 're gonna do here is , we 're gonna be making some commercials and asking you to just come on up and try the product and tell us what you honestly think of it . We 're not gonna put any words in your mouth . Someone who might like to just come along , try a little Cheese Tease and perhaps ... Oh , here 's somebody right here . Valerie , why don 't ... Hi ! No ? You don 't care for any . Okay . All right , thank you very much . What we 're really looking for is ... Hiya ! How are you ? Someone who might like to just come along , try a little Cheese Tease ... And here 's someone right here . Valerie , why don 't we ... Hi , what 's your name ? Let me tell you right off . We don 't like things in cans . You buy soft drinks in cans . Yeah , but this is cheese . Oh , I see , because it 's a dairy product . The idea of a dairy product being in a can ... Exactly ! Right . I mean , beer in a can ... Well , how about on a cracker ? Beans in a can ... Now , why don 't we just have an open mind and an open mouth , huh ? Okay , try this . It 's so delicious . Give my daughter one , please . What ? This is your daughter ? This is not your sister ? I can 't believe it ! Of course , one for your lovely daughter . What do you think , honey ? Is this delicious to you guys or what ? Now tell the truth ! What do you think ? Huh ? Huh ? What we 'd like you to do is look in the camera and say , " Mmm , tastes like real cheddar cheese ! " You don 't think it does ? You really don 't ? Uh-uh . It doesn 't ? Well , what does it taste like ? Shit ! Watch yourself . Watch the cart . Watch the cart . Oh , Concepcion , Concepcion , watch our things . Watch where you 're going . I 'm so sorry . You little monster ! Are you all right ? I 'm so sorry . Jeff , oh , Jeff , don 't you dare ! Step right over here . Pardon me . Jeff ! Whoops , here we go . Huh ? Jeff , come here , darling . One more ! One more ! Which one has the real cheddar on it and which one has the Cheese Tease ? More importantly , which one says , " Take me home ! " I know you want me to be honest , so I must confess they both taste like Clorets . You see , when you shoved the crackers in my mouth , I was chewing gum and they all got mixed up together . Your car 's all loaded , Mrs. Kramer . Oh , here you are , Stu , thank you . Here 's a free can of Cheese Tease , uh ... Oh , well , thank you . Enjoy ! Thank you again . It 's good on anything . It has a shelf life of 12 years . Okay , well , goodbye and thank you . Bye . Bye . Wonderful family . My story , the story of Pat Kramer , began on what seemed to be a perfectly normal day . Mom , can we stay up till Dad comes home ? Maybe , we 'll see later . Mother , he 's on my side ... You promised ! I did not and don 't you talk with your mouth full and yell in my ear like that . Skip laid another one . Boy , it smells ! Get your room deodorant . It 's not that bad . It 's not that bad ! Pat , ought to try Camper Clean . No more ring around the fender , honey . Great new diet daiquiri mix at the store , hon . Pat , you deserve a break today . Pat , you gotta get some of this stuff for your lawn ! Ever see our boat look better ? Pat , it 's Boat Sheen . Hi , Pat . I got some Valium . Hey , Pat , how about a weenie , huh ? There I was , safe and secure in the belief that nothing unusual ever happens in Tasty Meadows . Jeffrey Donald Kramer , you pick every one of those up and I mean it ! Hi , Judith ! Pat ! I was just this minute thinking of you . Don 't let him in ! He 's not clean ! Don 't let him in ! Get ready for the sale . Ding dong ! Flow Naturalle calling . Judith , come on in . Hey , Mom , look ! Jeff , give me those . Do A Little Bar of Soap for the guys . I certainly will not and oranges are for eating . You know what ? I know someday I 'm gonna find out you 're adopted ! Oh , I 'm so sorry . Pat , it 's all that sex and violence on TV . Give me that gun right now . Give it here ! Jeff , give me that gun . Give me that gun . Let 's go , come on , let 's go . Let 's go , all of you . Let 's go ! And no allowance till Skip gets his bath . Oh , Judith ! Here , I 'll do that . How about some coffee ? No , thank you , Pat . I know how busy you are . But I am so excited . You know that new product line I 'm going to sell ... I 'm so sorry , Judith . One of Jeff 's toys . Well , boys will be boys ! Especially in this household . Presenting Flow Naturalle . Go ahead . Now , they have Flow Naturalle hairspray , Fountain of Truth beauty cream and this is so light and fluffy on the face . No Fooling cleanser . I just love that tune . It is nice . No Sweat deodorant . What a name ! And , Pat , for the total woman , they have developed a new feminine hygiene spray called Breathe Easy ! Now , isn 't that a comfort ? This product not only does the job , but it 's also good for you . I have heard that a certain national leading brand , which shall remain nameless , actually kills cockroaches . Judith , no ! Disgusting . Beth says we need a pan of water and the hose won 't work . Concepcion , Concepcion . Hey , it 's working ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Well , I 'll just leave this questionnaire and your complimentary free samples . Judith , I , honestly , I don 't think I have room to store one more thing in this kitchen . Well , then , Pat , this is even more of a godsend than I thought . Watch this . It 's called . Tray Naturalle . Talk about clever . Thanks , Judith . Well , it 's been a pleasure serving you . Bong bing , Flow Naturalle leaving . Concepcion , we gotta get all this stuff put away . Oh , Jeff ! I 'm ignoring you , Jeff , but if you don 't go eat your supper , I 'm gonna have to tell your dad . ¶ Cheese , cheese , cheese , cheese ¶ The cheese that wants to please ... ¶ Honey , honey , I 'm coming . Sweetheart ! Hi , honey . Hi , Skip . Could be the agency 's biggest account . I made a one hour presentation . They gave me a standing ovation . Honey , did they ? Well , one guy said , " Nice job , Vance ! " Kids in bed ? Are you kidding ? They are dying to see you . That 's all they have talked about . Look who 's here . My children ! Hi . Hi . Guess the presents can wait . Dad ! Hello , kids . Have you been good kids while Daddy 's been away ? Aren 't those darling ? Airport presents . You have a wonderful father . Honey , what do you think of this name for a new candy we 're developing ? Exploded Comet . Oh , I think it sounds fine . I like it . Get us some . Please , Mom ! Okay , but one piece each and that 's it . And this is for you . Have you been a good girl while Daddy 's been away ? Airport presents ? No , it 's way past your bedtime . Look , Ma , disco ! Oh , yeah , come on . Disco right into the bed . We want to hear Little Bar of Soap . Yeah , yeah , yeah ! Please ! Please ! No , darlings , not tonight . No , no , no , no , no , no , no . Okay , okay , okay , okay , okay . Get in the bed , I 'll do it ! I 'll do it ! ¶ Oh , I wish I was a little bar of soap ¶ Bar of soap ¶ Oh , I wish I was a little bar of soap . Don 't throw . ¶ I 'd go slippy , slappy , slidy ¶ Over everybody 's hiney ¶ Oh , I wish I was a little bar of soap ¶ Bar of soap ¶ Lay down , lay down . Get in the bed . Let 's go . Come on , under the covers . Ma , I 'm cool . Oh , I know . You just like to see your old mother make a fool of herself , don 't you ? Good gum . Mom , can I have my space gun back ? Tomorrow . Go to sleep . Mom ? What ? I love you . Me , too . Me , too . I love you , too . Welcome home . Did you miss me ? Mmm . Mmm . Came straight from the factory . Smell this . Oh , honey . Oh , honey , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Oh , no , it 's nothing . It 's my fault , sweetheart . I 'm just gonna take it off and rinse it out before it stains . Thank heaven for polyester . Try this new detergent . The fumes from this perfume sting my eyes . Really ? But it smells good . If these new accounts work out , I could get a raise . Or the partnership ! Which name do you prefer for the new perfume ? Hypnotique ? Honey , too old-fashioned . How about Arise ? Hmm , it kind of sounds like a breakfast food to me . Breakfast food . Vance , oh , I know what to call it ! Sexpot ! Oh , I love it . I love it ! It could come in a little pot and be solid , so it wouldn 't spill . You 're not supposed to be out of bed . Neither are you ! Are they doing it yet ? Oh , no , no , no , not if it 's the perfume and not me . No , no , it 's you and the perfume and the night and the music . You know , Sexpot ... Sexpot . Hmm . Makes you think of sex and dope . I think it says it all . It may say too much . I think Sexpot is a direct , honest , hardcore , approach to selling perfume . Your wife is on the phone . She says it 's important . Vance , uh , honey , that blouse I had last night , you didn 't take it to the cleaners this morning or anything , did you ? What , honey ? The one I rinsed out , it 's ... Vance , it 's like it disappeared right off the towel . I ... Pat , we 're right in the middle of deciding on Sexpot . Can I call you later with this ? Wait , Vance . My fingernails , they seem like they 're shorter to me today than they were yesterday . Sweetheart , please , let me call you later . I 'm so sorry I called . Listen , I 'll see you tonight ? Yeah , bye . I love you , darling . Bye . Oh , I 'm sorry ... It 's all right . Meeting 's over . How 's Pam ? Pat ? She 's fine . Oh , Pat , Pat , oh . Sexpot , huh ? Yeah . Sexpot . I like it . I like it . It 's big . It 's big . Big ! Thank you , thank you . I hoped you 'd like it . You 're thinking big . Speaking of , this office big enough for you ? Well , it 's ... Why , what were you ... What are you ... What ? Let 's see what you do with this . Big , new glue account . That night , Vance brought me flowers . He was in such a festive mood and it was my turn to hostess our monthly block meeting , so , I decided not to mention my fingernails or the blouse incident again . Besides , we became involved in a new incident . And I am so happy to announce that we have enough money in the neighborhood kitty at last , to plant a new shrub . And that reminds me , Mrs. Wickes . I do believe there were several times last month that you neglected to clean up after your dog . Just one rainy day ! You know , it grieves me to see a grown woman cheapen herself by lying in front of her neighbors . I have it right here in my record book . I found the offensive evidence first on August 15th , about 8 : 00 p.m. and then again on August ... Honey . Hi . Hi , everybody . You brought me some flowers . Thank you , darling . Pauline , was that a double ? Yeah , thanks , honey . ... April 15th at 8 : 00 p.m. and again on April 22nd and then again on April 30th . Oh , Vance , it looks like the old body could use a little bit of tone . This body ? You should try running . It 's okay . It 's okay , Greg . ¶ You broke a vase ¶ Don 't wait for days ¶ Here 's what to do ¶ Good as new ! What is the name , Galaxy Glue ? How does that sound ? I think it sounds good . I 'd buy it . Not bad . What does it mean , honey ? What does it mean ? Concepcion , your carpool is here . Mother , where are my blue leotards ? In the dryer . Come on . Come on . Let 's see , they must be done . Look in the dryer here . I want to wear them to school tomorrow . Okay . Okay . Wait , honey , my hand is stuck . Oh , liquid glue ! Wait a second . Hey , wait , now , hold everything . Let me give it a karate chop , Mom . Don 't do anything rough ! Don 't . You just pull ... Wait , let me ... Now hold it . No , please . Now keep Skip out of here . No whining . Concepcion , no , don 't worry about it . Help me ! Concepcion ... This stuff really works , huh , hon ? Okay , take it easy . Concepcion ! Concepcion , take it easy ! ¶ Galaxy Glue , Galaxy Glue ¶ What would we do without Galaxy Glue ¶ Galaxy Glue , Galaxy Glue ¶ Life would go to pieces without Galaxy Glue ¶ Good morning , darling . Hi , hon . Look , there 's Dad 's commercial . Yes . Oh , and I just love it . I 've used it for years . Honey , we 're so proud of you . Thanks . She 's gonna say , " I don 't believe it " now . I don 't believe it ! See , I told you . It is good . Coffee ? Hello , little green man . Hello , monster face . Oh , honey . Are you dieting again , honey ? Honey , I 'm so sorry . Isn 't that silly ? Look , it 's okay . I 'm late . I 'm okay , anyway . I 'll talk to you later . Bye , honey . Vance , our lips used to meet . Perfectly normal , 5 ' 5 " . 5 ' 5 " ? But I 'm 5 ' 7 " . No , you 're 5 ' 5 " . These scales don 't lie . But I 've been 5 ' 7 " ever since I was 19 . That says 5 ' 7 " , doesn 't it ? Hi , Judith . Vance , I 'm getting smaller every day . We 'll see Dr. Atkins again tomorrow . Honey , I 'm sure there must be some logical explanation . I 'm sure there must . It 'll be okay . ¶ Galaxy Glue ¶ Look , honey , there 's your commercial . Galaxy Glue , sticks by you . I needed two full sets of pictures spaced several days apart to compare , before I could be sure . I don 't profess to understand it , Pat . There 's no medical precedent for what appears to be happening to you . I just know you 're getting smaller . These X-rays prove it beyond any doubt . Now I 'm sending you to the Kleinman Institute for the Study of Unexplained Phenomena . If there is any explanation for this at all , they 're the ones who 'll find it . Then began a series of grueling intensive tests . I was pinched , poked , prodded . I was examined by specialists I never even knew existed . They gave me radioactive iodine tests , scanning electron microscopic tests ... The target tissues have somehow reverted to multi-potentiality causing an apparent cascade effect on the pituitary . More importantly , there seems to be a complete lack of somatropin . We need more tests . Brain tests , bone tests , blood tests , bioneurothermal tests , ultrasonic tests , chromatography tests ... And there are hormonal problems as well as a glandular one , reversal of the self-action factor , a double helix inconsistency and erratic behavior ... Elasticity tests , enzyme tests , endocrine tests , chromosome tests , cellular tests , metabolic tests . Tests , tests and more tests ! We 've got it . Are you anemic ? After all those tests , you don 't know if she 's anemic ? Sweetheart , please , please . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Have you had a recent flu shot ? I did have a flu shot about two months ago . Do you drink tap water ? Of course I drink tap water . What are you trying to say to me , Doctor ? Please tell me what you mean . What I mean ? What I am saying , Mrs. Kramer , is that you are shrinking from a combination of the tap water , the flu shot , the perfume , the glue , the solvent , your bubble bath , talcum powder , shampoo , hair conditioner , setting lotion , hand lotion , mouthwash , hairspray , breath spray , feminine hygiene spray , deodorant , toothpaste , detergent , eye drops , nose drops , hair coloring , diet soda , birth control pills and smog . Set off by an imbalance already present in your system . Oh , God ! No need to be upset , Mrs. Kramer . We helped name half those products . And now that we know what 's caused it , we can work towards finding an antidote . Go home , let us do the worrying . Honey , maybe we should be proud . I mean , it seems like you 've got a wife who 's found a way to reverse the whole order of the universe . They 'll find an antidote , Pat . You just have to wait . Wait ? I can 't wait much longer . I 'm shrinking every day . You just have to try to be calm , honey . You stay calm ! Honey , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . It 's all right . It 's all right . I want you to start thinking about us and our marriage , Vance . Honey , you 've got to . I mean , this has been such a strain on both of us . Honey , as long as you have on this ... This ring , nothing 's changed between us . Let 's go home . As the weeks passed , I wondered if they ever did find the antidote , would they still be able to find me ? We 're hoppin ' mad , Dan ! As well you might be , Vance , but we wouldn 't wanna let your anger spill over on three of our biggest clients , now , would we ? Think of the dent it could put in their profits . Do you know that products could be banned from this ? Heads would roll , Vance . Heads would roll . What about the public ? I mean , couldn 't the label at least say , " Caution ! This product might be hazardous to your ... " To your size ? " We wait for the antidote and then I , personally , will conduct a no-holds-barred investigation . We 'll publish all the facts . How Pat was brought back to normal by a miracle of modern chemistry . What do you say , team ? To the antidote . To the antidote . To the antidote . I was attracting more and more attention each day . The smaller I got , the bigger my name . The top news story of the day continues to be the Incredible Shrinking Woman . Perhaps the petite Pat Kramer is a metaphor for the modern woman . It is no secret that the role of the modern housewife has become increasingly less significant . Reluctantly , I allowed Judith to talk me into leaving the house and it resulted in what will forever be known to us all as " The Supermarket Incident . " Judith , I don 't think this is such a good idea . Not to mention my legs have fallen asleep . I understand , Pat , but you just bear with me . This is chemical warfare and I wanna show you what we 're up against . Look at this . We have Mike 's Macho Meal . Let 's see here . " Fortified food flavoring ego boosters , " synthetic spermatozoa , testosterone , inert sugar syrup , " tumescent tissue of bull scrotum ... " Here we have Cousin Bud 's Speedy Spuds . Well , this has everything but the kitchen sink . Judith , I don 't think this is working . Please , get me out of here . Just ignore them , Pat . Of all the rudeness . Don 't you all have something you wanna shop for ? A little poison , maybe ? Just get me out of here . Mr. Bell . Excuse me , madam , but I 'm going to have to take a look in that bag . There is nothing in this sack that is of any concern to you . Oh , excuse me , Mrs. Kramer . Okay , it 's a go . I knew I was being stared at , but I didn 't know I was being spied on . And in my own shopping mall . It was becoming more and more difficult to lead a normal life . I 'm down here , darling . Vance did what he could to help . Everyone did . And the kids tried to understand . Okay , here I come . I 'm gonna tuck you in , ready or not . Good night , Concepcion . Good , you 're already tucked in . Mom , do A Little Bar of Soap . Oh , honey , not tonight . Are you gonna just keep ... Just keep shrinking away to nothing ? Hey , Ma , if mothers shrink , does that mean their kids will shrink , too ? Oh , no , honey , no . What happened to me is just some kind of freak accident . It 's not gonna happen to either one of you , I promise . Hey , Ma , I could drive the car for you . You could , you sure could . Mother , would you say this is the worst thing that ever happened to us ? Oh , no , honey , lots of things worse can happen . Yeah ? Like what ? Well ... Look , I 'll think of something and we 'll talk about it tomorrow , okay ? Night-night . Concepcion , do A Little Bar of Soap . Yes , yes ! Do it ! I was rapidly becoming famous , and so was Tasty Meadows . Ah , yes , but we were her first friends in the neighborhood . I believe it was I who first introduced you to Pat . Yeah , well , we took ' em to their first EST seminar . Yeah , well , she 's been like a sister to me . We 're this close . She 's been like a mother to me . Did she begin to shrink because no one noticed ? Did she begin to shrink because no one cared ? Did she begin to shrink because her role as homemaker was belittling ? When she looked at herself ... Pat , you are a celebrity . Ooh , let 's face it , Judith , I 'm a freak . Well , that 's true , but you are also a celebrity . ... why is Pat Kramer shrinking ? Oh , Concepcion ! I wish you 'd let me help you . Now , Judith , you know I am absolutely determined to do this myself . Mom ! You 're on TV again ! Oh , brother . The question in all our minds is , " Why is Pat Kramer shrinking ? " Vance , please , honey . Pat , ignore that . I believe what has happened is a blessing in disguise . A warning to us all . You should see yourself as a kind of divine sacrificial goat . Thanks to you , we 're all on our toes . I know I 'm much wiser now than I was . Yeah , me , too . Wiser , and smaller . No matter how you slice it , it doesn 't look good for the little lady from Tasty Meadows . At the Kleinman Institute , no one seems to have much hope ... You made all three networks . ... that is , except Pat Kramer , herself , as small as she is . She has great hope and determination . Hundreds of tourists pass the Kramer household each day . And thousands of letters and phone calls have been pouring into the station ... I 've got it , Pat . You 've got to go on national TV and tell all ! You owe it to your public . Oh , Judith , I don 't know . I ... Oh , honey . I guess we eat out again . Name and voice code . Tom Keller , 234-ZXE . Representing ? Representing Genetic Engineering Affiliated , International Dynamic Chemicals Corporation , Experimental Science , Omni National Research . Verified . Had I known then all that I know now , I might not have appeared on national TV , but all we knew that December was that Vance and I wanted to do what was right . Vance . No business like show business . Boy , when I think about all the people who are gonna see this , goose bumps . She 's gonna be positive , isn 't she ? Oh , excuse me . She 's gonna talk about the antidote . She 's not gonna mention the clients ' products ? Well , Pat feels the public should be warned , Dan . I mean , it is a question of integrity . Vance , let 's go over here for just a minute . ¶ Blow me a kiss ¶ From across the room ¶ Say I look fine when I 'm not ¶ Touch my hand ¶ As you pass my chair ¶ Little things mean a lot ¶ Look , I know her being 36 inches tall is a difficult dilemma . She 's not 36 inches anymore . You mean she 's shrunk since the last time I saw her ? I mean , she 's shrunk since the last time I saw her . I almost sat on her last night . I 'm afraid I 'm losing my sanity . We have to help her up the front steps . She showers in the sink . The other day she was holding a piece of toast . I thought it was her purse . And our sex life , don 't ask . I wasn 't going to . I come home , I don 't know what I might find . One day , I 'm afraid I might come home , I won 't even be able to find her . Do you know what I think , Vance ? I think you 've got a real bad case of self-pityitis . Dan , what if these products are dangerous ? Dangerous ? I 'll tell you what 's dangerous ! If your wife goes out there and creates a crisis in confidence in American consumerism , that 's dangerous ! Now , maybe some of our products do attack a few blood cells , but you 're talking about a television show where millions of people , millions of people are tuning in . Now , do you wanna look in there and tell them they can 't trust American products ? Do you know what they want ? They want hope . Hope ! And you wanna give them what they want , don 't you , Vance ? Hmm ? Don 't you ? ¶ Little things ¶ Mean a lot ¶ Thank you . I sang that song in honor of a very special , very brave and a very remarkable woman . You all have come to know her as the Incredible Shrinking Woman . Ladies and gentlemen , Mrs. Pat Kramer . Happy holidays , Mike . May I help you , Pat ? Mike , thank you , but I don 't wanna be treated any differently than anybody else . Is she great , folks ? Is that package for me , Pat ? Unfortunately , Mike , it 's for me . You know , I 've been told that the first official . Pat Kramer Fan Club is in our audience tonight . Everyone loves you , Pat . I hope you 'll take courage from that . I do , Mike , I really do . But let 's face it , it 's not making me any taller . Has it all been a nightmare or has anything good come from this extraordinary experience ? Well , Mike , I 'll tell you , um , it has mostly been a nightmare , but some good things have happened , like getting to come on your show here . I mean , nobody cared what I had to say when I was my normal height . For instance ... Excuse me , Pat . We 'll be right back after these messages . ¶ Galaxy Glue Galaxy Glue . I used Galaxy Glue when I was in the Peace Corps and that 's why we have so many friends and good allies . Galaxy Glue ? Hey , I 'm stuck on it . Everything is under control . ¶ Galaxy Glue It 's for you ¶ You know , everyone has one question in mind and I have that same question in my mind right now . Why are you shrinking ? It hasn 't been determined yet , Mike . Right on . Pat , after talking about your case with you , I must admit that I 'm more baffled now than I was before . I believe that you all know . Dr. Eugene Nortz . No , I don 't think I ... May I present my colleague , Ruth Ruth . What you are about to hear , gentlemen , Sandra , will deliver us to the threshold of a new era of civilization . We , the Organization for World Management can be the trail blazers of tomorrow and be assured our place as the power elite forever ! What Einstein did for time and space , I , Nortz , will do for shape and size ! My studies show that a serum could be developed from the blood of ... What 's her name ? Pam ? Pat . Pat Kramer . Yes . A shrink serum , which can be used to reduce individuals or entire nations . And using a process , not unlike water fluoridation . A few drops in a country 's water system would be most effective for shrinking masses of people . Except , of course , for a few of us . Shrink the world . Hey , I like it . All we need is the Kramer woman in our hands . Well ... I feel I would need assurances , you know , that no harm was gonna come to that little lady , or , well , you 'd have to count me out . Not so fast , Dan . We can 't count you out . You know too much . Oh , I may know too much , but I think fortunately , you know , for all of us here ... See , I don 't really understand everything it is that I know . Now that 's what really counts , isn 't it ? I need her blood ! You have our word , no harm will come to the Kramer woman . Now , do you have some ideas about how we should approach her ? Oh , I 've got ideas . Old Dan has got a Plan A , sure . Is there something you 'd like to say to America ? I want to thank everybody first , so much for all the cards and the letters you 've sent . All the , all the good wishes , because Vance and the children and I ... It 's meant so much to us . Right now I think we 're sort of existing on prayers and hope . So I want to thank you very much , America . And happy holidays . Christmas came and went . And so did Skip . To my family I 'd become a doll and to our dog , a chew stick . While Concepcion had her hands full with the kids and the curiosity seekers , I , reluctantly , moved into the dollhouse and tried to contribute to the mounting doctor bills by working on my memoirs . The strange , almost stranger-than-strange , unbelievable story of Pat Kramer is one that must be told . I know , because unfortunately , I am Pat Kramer . The strange , almost stranger than strange ... Hey , Ma ! I 'm busy , Jeff ! Mom , it 's an emergency . Honey , what is it ? Jeff ! Jeff , honey , what is it ? Honey ! Say " Cheese . " Make believe there 's a birdie there . Pose ! Oh , Jeff , go to your room . Right now ! And the rest of you , off the furniture ! And what are you grinning at , you big creep ? Oh , now , I am really mad ! And I 'm taking mother to school for Show and Tell . You are not ! She 's going with me ! She 's going to do Little Bar of Soap and that 's final ! Okay , I am mad now . I want everybody out of here right now ! Billy Beasley , stop that ! I 'm gonna count to 10 . I want this stopped right now ! One , two , three ... Oh ! Listen ... And you ... Come on ... Oh ! Billy Beasley , oh , wait , you wouldn 't dare ! Don 't you dare , that 's my mother ! Wait a sec ... Wait a second ! Hi . I 'm Robbie the Robot . Let 's blast off together ! Meet me at the space station ! Hi , I 'm Ricky the Rabbit . I like to play the drums . Hi , I 'm Betsy Wetsy . Pat ! Great news , honey ! I brought Dan home . And the president of Paxton Toys . Great little kidder . Pat ? So when all the fan mail came in from your TV appearance , we got a big idea . Right , Vance ? Yeah , well , you and Tom did really , actually . More champagne , Pat ? Vance , look what you did ! Oh , I 'm sorry , hon . You 're such a good sport and you 've got such a cute personality . It hit me , you could make millions advertising products . Tom here wants to make a doll out of you . The Pam ... Uh-uh . Pat Kramer doll . I have arranged for my private plane to fly you to our main design center . We want to start immediately . More champagne ? You did it again ! Look , he did it again ! What do you say ? You get your little things together and we can leave right away . Tonight ! Oh , uh , I think tonight is a little soon , maybe tomorrow would be more appropriate . Honey , I don 't wanna go tomorrow or any other day . She didn 't mean what she just said . Really , you know ? I certainly hope not , Vance . She 's gonna be a big star . You better talk to , uh ... Tom ! Concepcion 'll do that tomorrow , don 't bother . That 's okay . You think I should take the offer , don 't you ? What I think is that this could be the first good thing to come out of all this . I mean , there are all these bills . We could use the money . That 's all we 've talked about all night long is money . I wish you 'd just think about it . I have . I have thought about it . I just know I 'm not interested . Well , then I guess you 're not interested in this , either . Good night , Pat . Well , it looks like we switch to Plan B. Don 't worry , Tom . Old Dan 's in charge . Oh , Vance . Sorry , Stan . Move over , you big lug . The next morning I awoke to find I was shrinking again . Outside our house , the crowds were growing . Our neighbors were becoming as world-famous as I was . Being in the spotlight was changing everyone . Even Concepcion . Concepcion ! Don 't worry about the bacon , Pat , I 'm late already . What do you want me to tell Dan ? I don 't know , Vance . I knew you wouldn 't do it . Vance , I tried to accept the idea , I really did . I just don 't want to become another product ! I 'm sick of products ! I 'm sick of advertising ! You 're talking about my work ! You 're talking about our plans ! How do you think we bought that radio ? How do you think we pay for this house ? I happen to be living in a dollhouse , in case you haven 't noticed lately ! Concepcion , do something ! Stop this ! Beth ... Concepcion , do something ! Turn off the radio ! I 'm gonna lose my mind , somebody do something ! Concepcion ! Stop this smoking ! I 'm sorry , my wife is not interested at this time . She 's ... Yeah , she 's been through a lot . Oh , well , please call us if your wife changes her mind . Maybe some other time . Thank you , thank you anyway . Plan C. I love you , Pat . I 'm sorry , I just don 't see how selling a cute little doll could hurt anything . A cute little doll ? Vance , do you think we need another cute little doll in the world ? I mean , really ? Do you think we need another glue or a perfume or a detergent that eats away dirt along with your life ? I mean , you tell me ! Come on , kids . Pat , when you 're ready to come down off that soap box , give me a call . - Bye , Mom . - Goodbye , Mom . Honey , wait . Vance ? Honey , wait ! Wait ! Don 't leave , Vance , I love you . Wait a second ! Wait a second . Vance ? Wait , don 't ... Kids , wait a second , I need you ... I love you all . Please ! Vance ! Concepcion ! Concepcion ! Concepcion ! Stop ! Stop ! Concepcion , please ! Concepcion , don 't do anything ! Got some flowers here for a Pat Kramer . Who are you ? No speak English . No English . Concepcion . Concepcion . In the most bizarre and tragic turn in an already tragic story . The Incredible Shrinking Woman , Pat Kramer , has been lost in a fatal household accident . ... that the whole nation joined in mourning the untimely passing of Pat Kramer . ... that the hopes for the Incredible Shrinking Woman are down the drain . Funeral at 11 : 00 . Beloved friends and neighbors , we are gathered here today to bid goodbye to a beautiful and courageous woman who gave so very much and got so little . No one will ever fill your shoes . Help me ! Somebody , help me . Where am I ? What am I doing in here ? Somebody let me out of here ! Help me , please ! Can 't you hear me ? Please help me ! Listen , there 's been a mistake ! Somebody , there 's been a big mistake ! Oh , Dr. Ruth . Dr. Ruth , thank heavens . Please , help me . Is something wrong ... Is something wrong with the monitors ? I haven 't caught him yet , but I think Sidney plays with the wires . Please , somebody , tell me where I am . Can he reach over there ? I don 't know . But then I don 't know how he does half the things he does . Like , how 'd he learn sign language in three weeks ? How come he can beat the computer at chess ? You know , he 's downright abnormal if you ask me . No offense , Sidney . Please tell me where I am ! If you 're not quiet , Mrs. Kramer , we 're going to have to sedate you again . Sidney 's got another one of his headaches . If you ask me , he 's addicted to pain pills . Well , he 's been under a lot of strain , you know . Cage is a mess . Clean up all those banana peels ! See , he 's saying , " Sidney in pain . Sidney head hurt . " Oh , poor Sidney . If you ask me , he 's faking it . I 'm sorry now we did teach him sign language . All he ever does is complain . Now what 's he trying to say ? Sidney in pain . Sidney heart hurt . Why should his heart hurt ? It 's my guess he feels sorry for her . Thousands and thousands of dollars and all we 've got to show for it is a sentimental gorilla . Is this monitor working ? Testing . One , two , three , four . Real cute , Sidney . Real cute . Dr. Nortz ? Dr. Nortz ? What kind of timeframe are we dealing with ? The answer 's already in her blood . We 'd simply have to get the answer before she disappears . Maybe we should kick this around a little more . Too late now . I knew I 'd found a friend . There was something I felt from this big , sweet gorilla that can best be described as human kindness . There had to be a way we could help each other . Sidney , keys ! There must be keys ! If you could get the keys and unlock your cage . The keys . Yes , you know , you know , the keys ! Hey , how you doing , guys ? Here 's looking at you . ¶ And all the monkey 's aren 't in the zoo ¶ Every day you meet quite a few ¶ So , you see , it 's all up to you ¶ You could be swinging on a star ¶ Sidney ! Hey ! What a mess . More banana peels . Oh , please , won 't you help me ? You look so much kinder than the others . Look , I only work here , lady . Don 't you know who I am ? I 'm the Shrinking Woman . I 'm Pat Kramer . Oh , they told me you 'd say that . You 're Pat Kramer 's clone . The real Pat Kramer 's dead . Dead ? Deader than a doornail . Dr. Nortz made a clone of her right before she bit the dust . No , no , I 'm not a clone . I 'm not . You 've got to believe me . Dr. Nortz is a liar ! He took an oath when he became a doctor . He 's supposed ... Listen , Dr. Nortz is a wonderful man . They 're all wonderful here . This is a place where great work is going on that will help all humanity . They told me so . Hey , Sidney , give me back those keys . This is a horrible , horrible place where people are used like guinea pigs , even Sidney . You 've got to help me . Call my husband , please ? Oh , please , he must be worried sick . Look , I make it a point not to get involved with clones . 'Night , Sidney . Sidney , quick , the folder . That folder . Yes , yes . Put it right up here . Oh ! Thank you . Oh ! Thank you , Sidney . I read all through the night . The horror in my heart mounting with each page as I learned of their diabolical plan . These people were so big , the only way they could become bigger was by making all of us smaller . What little blood I had left began to boil . No ! No , Sidney , you don 't know what they 're trying to do to us . You just can 't imagine . I couldn 't stand by and just let this happen . But what could I , the smallest person on the face of the earth do to help anyone ? We gotta do something , Sidney . Help , Sidney ! Thank you , Sidney . Hey ? Hey , what 's going on here ? Hey , what do you think you 're doing ? This is against regulations . You could get us all in a lot of trouble . We 're already in a lot of trouble . Dr. Nortz is planning to use me to shrink the world . I know you don 't believe me , but look in my folder . Go ahead , look , read page 10 . The pink page . Look , read it , you 'll see ! Shrink the world ? Sidney , too ? All kinds of people , everybody . Oh , please , if you care about Sidney . If you care about anything . Please let me call my husband . Please . They really are planning to shrink the world ! Vance ! Vance , there 's someone on your private line . She says she 's your wife . I gotta stop these crank calls . Sorry , Dan . Vance , Vance ! It 's me ! I 'm alive ! I 'm alive ! Pat , my God , where are you ? Pat , my God ! Pat , where are you ? Vance , listen , I don 't have much time . I 've been kidnapped by the Organization for World Management . They wanna use me to shrink the world . Pat , my God ! Where are you ? Oh , Rob , quick , where am I , Rob ? Where am I ? Oh , um ... Vance ! Vance ! Pat ! Pat ! Vance ! Vance ! Operator ? Operator ? I 'm so sorry , but you have been disconnected from the party to whom you were speaking . And you better lay off the buttons , buster ! Hello ? Rob , save yourself ! Save yourself ! Go on , save yourself ! Look , maybe I ... No , they 'd find me . All right , okay , look , I 'll be back , I 'll be back . I swear . No . Don 't ... You leave him alone ! Don 't you hurt him ! Oh , you 're in big trouble , little lady . I demand to know what you did with Rob . You 're in no position to demand anything . Have you looked at yourself in a mirror lately ? Now , hold still . Leave me alone ! Leave me alone ! I need some more blood to work with . - Don 't touch me ! - Don 't touch me ! Hold still . Hold . No ! No ! This news bulletin just in . A new development in the increasingly mysterious Pat Kramer case . My wife is alive . She phoned me , she 's been kidnapped . I called the police and they didn 't believe me . She 's being held by a group that call themselves the Organization for World Management or something . I see . You don 't believe me , either . My wife is alive . My wife is alive ! I 'm sorry . No , no , Mr. Kramer . I was so small by afternoon that I could slip through the bars of my cage . So they found another prison for me . Rob , I can 't believe it ! I can 't believe it ! We thought you were dead ! They couldn 't catch me . I know this place like the back of my hand . Here , Sidney . Catch , Sidney . You know , it 's our station 's policy to always try to present both sides of every issue . To answer Mr. Kramer 's charges , Mr. Logan Carver . Thank you . As a representative of the Organization for World Management , I can only say , Jacki , that of course there 's no connection between the deceased Kramer woman and our company . And that shocking phone call can only be interpreted as a heinous , sadistic crank call or the understandably confused imagination of a bereaved husband . Lift . Lift . Hurry . Hurry ! Lift . Lift . It 's too risky keeping her alive . The gorilla , he could talk . Mmm . They 're escaping . And so are we . Oh , look out ! Wait , Rob . Rob , get the pink page . Wait , Sidney . Wait ! Oh , thank you , Sidney . Come on , Sidney . Let go of me ! There he is ! Which way did they go ? This way , men , come on . Fire ! Up , Sidney . Up . The street is up . Press the up bottom . Good boy , yes . They 're in car number two . They 're headed for the street . Cut the power in car number two . We 're almost to the top . We 're almost there , Sidney , we 're almost there . We 're trapped . We 're trapped , Sidney . Sidney , the escape hatch ! In the ceiling . The escape hatch . Open the escape hatch . Open it , Sidney ! Oh , Sidney ! There he is ! Up there ! He 's on the rope . Freeze ! Sidney ! Sidney , jump , jump . Now ! Come on ! Come on . Jump ! Don 't let them get away . After them ! Oh , Sidney ! We 're okay . We 're safe . It 's my shopping center . Now , I 'm not a professional actress . I am a real person , like yourself . And I 'm not here to sell you a product , but to give you some good consumer advice . What are you , some kind of a nut ? Arrest me ! You haven 't done anything ! Be careful . Everyone , please . Everyone . Listen to me . It 's me . I 'm Pat Kramer ! Everyone ! Everyone , listen to me . I 'm the Incredible Shrinking Woman . That 's Pat Kramer , my neighbor . Someone call her husband . She 's alive . I knew she was alive . Yes . Yes , it 's me . We escaped . It 's me . We made it . Everyone , please , listen to me . Uh ... Listen , I 'm shrinking fast . I don 't have much time . A minute ago , I thought I ... I felt it was my duty to warn you that what happened to me could happen to you , but , now , I feel different . You don 't need me to tell you what 's wrong with the world . Oh , I wish Vance was here . Now , Rob ... Rob , you take care of page 10 . Make sure it gets in the right hands . And , Sidney , you take care of Rob . I feel just like I 'm becoming part of everything , and everyone . Here I go . Goodbye . Excuse me . Oh , Vance , I never thought I 'd see you again . Vance , Jeff , I 'm not afraid . Don 't you be . I love you . ¶ I wish I was a little bar of soap Good evening , ladies and gentlemen . This is Lyle Parks and the entire KXRZ news team , coming to you live from Tasty Meadows , California .

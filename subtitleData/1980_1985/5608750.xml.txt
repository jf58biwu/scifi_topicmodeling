 Don 't push me . Stick with him , don 't let him get too far ahead . - Daddy , I 'm tired , can 't we stop ? - Yeah , Honey . There aren 't many people on the side streets , and they 're darker . - That 's just what they 'd want , Honey . - Daddy , I 'm scared . So am I , Honey , just hang on . Be light , be a feather . - What 's going on ? - Excuse me ! Oh , he 's seen us . Whatever you do , no eye contact . - He can make you do what he wants . - Got it . See him , he just got lost in that crowd there ? That 's him , over on the right . Right there on the right . Maybe I can cut him off at the corner . Let 's get him . Daddy , they 're coming . Taxi , taxi . Drive ! - Stop ! - Hey ! Stop the car ! Hey , cabbie ! Don 't pay any attention to them , just drive . Stop it ! Come on , let 's get back to the car . We can chase them down . Let 's move it . Hey , mister , where are we going ? The airport . Oh , wait , wait , wait , I can 't go to the airport , it 's too far . Look ... I 'm gonna give you a $ 500 bill and I want you to take my daughter and I to the airport , do you understand me ? Sure , sure , okay , mister . Drive ! I ain 't turning down no $ 500 . We are going to give each one of you ten young ladies and gentlemen an injection . Now , five of these injections will be water . Five of them will be water mixed with a tiny amount of a chemical compound which we call ... " lot six " . The exact nature of this compound is classified but it is essentially a hypnotic mild hallucinogenic . We employ the double-blind method of administering the compound , which is to say that neither you nor we know who has received the clear dose and who has not . Until later , that is . You will be under close supervision for 48 hours after the experiment . Are there any questions ? Dr. Wanless , is this experiment being done by The Shop ? No . Absolutely not . Yes ? When do I get my money ? Right on , man . Now , that is important . Well , immediately after the experiment , along with all the other students . I 'm broke , too . So , if we may begin the injections now , please . Andy McGee . I 'm Vicky Tomlinson . I 'm a little nervous about this , Andy McGee . - What if I go on a bad trip or something ? - We 'll probably just get distilled water . Feel any pain ? I feel a pressure , it 's a bad pressure . It will pass . - How are you feeling ? - When do we start to shrink ? You believe you 're going to shrink ? Sh-ri-nk ... You 'll be fine . We 'll be fine . I can 't feel my hands . - Thank you , what a nice compliment . - I didn 't say anything . You did . - What 'd I say ? - You said my hair is beautiful . Like copper set on fire . Yeah . But I didn 't say that ... I just thought it . I love you . I 've always loved you . - I 've known you for a thousand years . - That long ? Yes , I 've loved you , too . Hey , buddy , airport . You okay ? I got a headache . Wake up , Baby Doll . We 're here . Come on . Where are we ? Hanover , sweetheart . Airport . - Try the airport . - Roger . Suppose we catch up with him , do you wanna face him down ? What do you call this thing he 's got , how he pushes people ? The Shop figures he may be running down by now . He 's overdone it before and wound up in bed . It 's doing something to his brain . Like what ? Giving himself pinprick hemorrhages , maybe ? - It could kill him . - Good , let 's hope . We don 't have any more money and we don 't have anything left to sell . I can 't stay here . It 's not right , it 's not right to steal . Honey , I know , but it 's not right for them to keep coming after us , either . Now , I explained that to you , Charlie , at least I tried . - About the big bad and the little bad ? - That 's right , lesser and greater evil . - Big bad is what I did to Mommy ? - Oh , Darling , please . Don 't . Don 't , baby . I made Mommy scream . Shh ... Does your head still hurt ? Poor Daddy . Gotta keep a lookout . Okay . I don 't know what you 're doing here . We 've been through this a hundred times . I don 't want to have anything to do with you . I told you not to follow me here . Besides , it 's not my fault . I 'm not responsible . This ain 't got nothing to do with me , I 'm not the only guy you 've been seeing . That 's not true ! I 'm not ready to get married , so why don 't you just get outta here ? Why don 't you just stop bugging me ? Come on , Charlie . You told me you loved me . You told me if anything happened you 'd take care of me . This ain 't got nothing to do with me . We 've been through this 100 times ... I don 't want you around . I 'm not responsible . Look , I told you not to follow me here . But I can 't do it on my own , I don 't know where to go . - And I don 't have any money . - I 'm not the only guy you 've been with . That 's not true . I swear to God you 're the only one . I 've never slept with anyone else . That 's not what my buddy Al told me , he ... I didn 't mean it , Daddy . Ow ! Hey , hey ! - All right , buddy , come outta there . - You mind waiting ' til I put my feet out ? I was coming with you and I saw him and before I could stop it , it just happened . - I didn 't like him and it just got away . - It 's okay , Honey , it 's okay . - But I set him on fire . - Charlie . - I didn 't mean it , Daddy . - Charlie , stop it . Now I want you to listen to me . You said it got away from you and it did . But not like before . It just got away a little bit . Charlie , you might 've set that man 's face on fire or his hair . Now , it always goes out at somebody you don 't like . - But you didn 't really hurt that guy . - Not like I hurt Mommy in the kitchen . Baby ... Baby , you 've got to stop thinking about that . It wasn 't you that really hurt Mommy , it wasn 't you that ... They killed her . That 's right , that 's right . Now ... we 've got to go on . Single file , just like Indians . And keep as far over to the side of the road as you can , okay ? Yeah , I seen them both , this guy looked kinda sick , or something . Are you okay ? - So far , so good , Baby . You getting tired ? - Nope . Daddy , I feel those bad men from The Shop around again . Okay , come on . Okay , Sweetheart , come on . Why don 't you head up Route 70 . Oh , Daddy . Daddy , get up . Daddy , wake up . Oh , my God ! Daddy ? Daddy ? Are you all right ? - I thought you were dead . - Are you kidding ? Think I 'd do that to you ? You 're all I 've got in this world . But I 'm happy about that 'cause I 'm crazy about you . I 'm crazy about you too , Daddy . Come on , we gotta find a place to sleep . We can afford it now . - I burned him . - Rest , Sweetheart . You didn 't hurt him. you controlled it . Shh ... Okay , Charlie , now , let it out , easy does it . Let it go . Atta girl . Atta girl . Okay . Now pull it back . Pull it back , Charlie ! Pull it back , Charlie ! Good Lord . Now , you 've got to learn to control that . You gotta try real hard , okay ? - I couldn 't help it . - Tomorrow , she 's tired . Time for bed , you can try again at breakfast . Okay ? - I wanna do that again . - No , tomorrow . I 'm not tired . I wanna do it again . - I said no . - Again ! Now ! I 'm sorry , Mommy , I didn 't mean it . Well , you did it , you hurt your mother . - I 'm sorry , Mommy . - It 's all right , Mommy 's all right . Charlie , you have got to control this thing because it 's a bad thing , you understand me ? A bad thing . Leave her alone , it 's not her fault . - Hello ? - Sorry . - Hung up again ? - Yeah , whoever it is . We know who they are and they wanna make sure we 're staying right here . Vicky ? Charlie ? I 'm home . Sweetheart ? Vicky ! Oh ... Oh , no . Oh , no ! Please , please , God . Please don 't be here . Please don 't . Oh , no ! Please , no , no ! Oh , no ! Babe ! Oh , what did they do ? What did they do ? They put this in your mouth . Where 's Charlie ? Charlie ! Charlie ! Charlie ! Charlie ! Charlie ! Charlie ! Joan , by any chance is my daughter with you ? Hold her ! Okay , that 's far enough . Drop the gun . Drop the gun . Drop it . Bring her to me . You 're blind . My eyes ! My eyes ! You too , you son of a bitch . You killed my wife . You 're blind . My eyes ! My eyes ! Oh , my God ! Leon ! Andy ! My eyes ! Joan . Go back inside the house , you won 't remember any of this . Leon ! Oh , God ! My eyes ! Son of a bitch ! Can 't see ! - Wake up , Baby , it 's time to move on . - Morning . - Elaine . Morning , Josie . - Good morning . Paul Jamieson called in , no word yet on the McGees , he 'll ring later . Put him right through when he does . Oh , Rainbird 's in your office . - When did he get back ? - This morning . - Morning , Kenny . - Morning , Sir . Welcome back , Rainbird . How was Venice ? Sinking . - Is our problem there solved ? - Our problem there is solved . - Dr. Wanless is here . - Oh , Christ , there goes a beautiful day . Ah , the good doctor . What do you want , Joe ? - Have you caught them yet ? - We 'll catch them . What do you want ? What do I always want ? Why do I stay alive ? To try to persuade you to sanction them both , expunge them , wipe them from the face of the earth . Andrew McGee and his daughter constitute the greatest threat that 's ever confronted this nation . - That 's a lot of crap . - You feel guilt ! Because eight out of ten of our young volunteers have died ... committed suicide . You want to justify your participation . You were all in favor of it at the time . I know . I didn 't realize . None of us did . Lot Six was nothing more than a synthetic copy of pituitary extract . A powerful painkiller hallucinogen . For God 's sake , Joe , don 't start again , come on . You see ... You see ... this pituitary extract is responsible for the occasional flashes of psi ability which most human beings demonstrate from time to time . Precognition , telekinesis , mental domination , the kind of domination that this experiment brought out in Andrew McGee . What is the point , Doctor ? Ever since this child was born , her father has been trying to inhibit her use of those powers . But ... but what if his control had weakened now ? Why would he lose control now after all these years ? Ask yourself this question . How exhausting must it have been for Victoria and Andrew McGee when this child was an infant ? The bottle is late , the baby cries . And at that moment , one of her stuffed toys right there in the crib beside her bursts into smoky flame . Joe , she 's just a little girl , she can light fires , yes , but you 're making her sound like Armageddon . Yes , and that 's what it might well be . Suppose lighting fires is merely the tip of the iceberg . I don 't know what you 're talking about . I am talking about a talent that is directly linked to this child 's pituitary gland , undeveloped pituitary gland . What happens when she becomes adolescent and that sleeping gland wakes and becomes , for 20 months , the most powerful force in the human body ? Suppose we have a child here who some day is capable of creating a nuclear explosion simply by the power of her will . - That 's insane . - Is it ? Is it ? Then allow me to progress from insanity to utter lunacy . Suppose there is a little girl out there somewhere today , this morning , who has within her , lying dormant at present , the power some day to crack the very planet in two , like a china plate in a shooting gallery . What if we could train this little girl , and others as well ? Could we have more powerful weapons ? No ! No more experiments . Don 't force me to go above your head because I swear to you I will if I have to . I 'll have you and this entire establishment eliminated . An excitable man . Where are we gonna go now ? Well , we 're gonna have to find some place to stay for a while . I don 't think anybody 'll believe us but if we send letters to the important newspapers maybe The Shop will have to lay off . We could go to Granther 's . - What made you think of that ? - I don 't know . 'Cause I was thinking about your grandfather not five minutes ago . We 'll check the motel , I want you to work the road further down . Got it . Well , that 's a pretty little miss . - What 's your name , missy ? - Roberta . Well , Bobby , where are you headed for this morning ? Well , we 're headed for Tennessee ... Knoxville , my wife 's there visiting her sister . - Ran into a little problem . - Did she now ? Yeah , labor . This one 's got a new baby brother ... 1 : 40 this morning . - His name 's Andy . Isn 't that a nice name ? - I think it 's a corker . Mine 's Irv Manders . C 'mon in now , I 'll get you ten miles closer to Knoxville anyway . - Hey , Al , Al , Al ! It 's them ! It 's them ! - You 're joking ? - No , damn it , it 's them . - Did you get the number ? Yeah , I got it . - Did you see which way they went ? - I didn 't even see them check out . Hey , we got ' em . Why don 't you two come home , take lunch with me and the wife ? - Oh , we couldn 't ... - Daddy , I 'm starving . - Well , you sure you got enough ? - Always , and I 'm glad to have you . - Thank you very much . - My pleasure , Bobby . It 'll be my wife 's , too when she gets a look at you . I always wanted a little girl herself . But I guess that wasn 't to be . Got a song for you . - Who 'd you bring home , Irv ? - This little girl is Roberta . This young fella here 's her daddy . I didn 't catch his name yet so I don 't know if we 're related . - Frank Burton , Ma 'am . - Hello , I 'm Norma Manders . - Hi . - Hello . Your husband was nice enough to invite us back for lunch , hope you don 't mind . Why , sure , come on in . Come on , Bobby , feedbag . More room out than there is in , Button . If I eat any more , I think I 'll split . That 's what my mom used to ... I mean ... I mean that 's what she always says . Norma , why don 't you and Bobby go out and feed those chickens ? I wanna have a little talk with Frank here . - Would you like that ? - Do they peck ? Only what they eat , Honey . - Come on . - Okay , goody . Want a beer , Frank ? - It isn 't Frank , but I guess you know that . - I guess I did . - What is your name ? - Andy . - Well , Andy , what about that beer ? - I guess I could use it . You got it . - There you go . - Thank you . - Here , let me help . - No , that 's all right , I know this routine . - Cops after you , Andy ? - Sort of cops , yeah . You snatch that little girl from her mother ? No , she 's my daughter , but her mother didn 't set the cops on us . Her mother 's been dead for a year . Don 't appear like you got her against her will . What do they want you for , anyway , Andy ? - Who are they ? - Government agents . - FBI ? - No , The Shop . The Shop ? Yeah , it 's really the Department of Scientific Intelligence , D.S.I. My daughter , Charlene and I , Charlie , we were part of an experiment that happened a long time ago . Tell me about it . Okay , now go ahead . Thank you . Do you eat these chickens ? If I can catch one , I might eat one . We eat the eggs . They want to examine her and study her . So they can figure out just what makes her able to do what she can do . I think they want to use her to reactivate the Lot Six program . Andy , I think you ought to call the police , turn yourself in . - Yeah , I know it sounds crazy . - As crazy as anything I 've ever heard . Daddy , I fed the chic ... You told . Daddy , why 'd you tell ? They 're coming , they 're coming for us . They 're gonna kill you , Daddy . We have to run , we have to hide , we have to ... Yes , yes , that 's what they wanna do , they wanna kill you . Kill you like they did Mommy and take me away , I won 't let it happen , I won 't . Holy Jesus Christ , did she do that ? Charlie , now watch what you 're doing . Is it too late ? Yes , they 're coming up the dirt road now . Daddy , I 'm scared . Charlie , you can stop ' em . If I do something bad , will you still love me ? Oh , Charlie ... of course I 'll still love you . I love you more than anything in the world , no matter what happens . I got some tall apologizing to do , there 's a line of cars coming up the road . I 'll stand with you if you want , I 'll get my deer gun . You don 't need your gun . Hi , Andy . Hi , Charlie . - Honey , you don 't have to run any more . - Go away . Afraid I can 't do that , Honey , I have my orders . No one wants to hurt you or your daddy . You liar , you 're supposed to kill him and I know it . I 'd advise you do what my daughter says . You know why she 's wanted . Remember the soldier at the airport ? You men are trespassing . I want you to get the hell off my property . We 're government agents , Sir . These two folks are wanted for questioning , nothing more . I don 't care if they 're wanted for assassinating the President ! - Show me a warrant or get the hell off my land . - We don 't need a warrant . You do unless I woke up in Russia this morning . If you 'll just get in the car , we can discuss all this . Honest to gosh , there 's nothing going on here except ... - We know what 's going on . - Please , don 't make me do anything . Get out ! Don 't you understand what she 's doing ? Can 't you feel it ? Don 't be stupid ! If we can only discuss this , please . - Get him ! - Watch it , Andy , watch it . Not the girl ! Not the girl ! Help ! Help ! Help me ! No , don 't . No , don 't . No ! Don 't ! Now , get out of here . She 's never done anything like this before and I don 't know if she can stop . Get out ! Get out ! Go ! Go ! Help me ! - Let 's go ! - Don 't leave me ! Charlie . Stop it ! That 's enough ! Charlie ! Charlie ! Charlie ! Sorry , Daddy . Let 's get outta here , back to The Shop . Go , go , go ! Oh , my God . Andy , there 's an old Willy 's Jeep out behind the barn . No , Irv , don 't get involved any deeper . None of those men came here without any warrants at all , tried to take them off our land , one of them shot me . What do you want me to do , sit here and turn ' em over to the secret police ? They 'll be getting their peckers up enough to come back . Be a good Nazi ? - I guess not . - You don 't have to do anything else . No , please , take the Jeep and get away . Just get away . Charlie . There 's the lake . We 're here . Come on , Charlie . We got a lot of cleaning up to do . Ya know , nobody 's lived here since your grandfather died . I hope that key 's still here . Do you think they 'll find us here ? After what you did at the farm , I think they 're gonna stay pretty far away . If they still wanna capture us , they 're gonna have to figure out a different way to do it . Well , anyways , we 've got us a new home . Let 's go , let 's go . Don 't it look good ? Daddy , will things ever be the same for us again ? Will I be able to go to school , and things , again ? Sure you can . - After you write the letters , right ? - That 's right . Tell the newspapers all about it . Then the running 'll be over . And we 'll live normal lives , like everybody else . - Can I be ... ? - What ? - Like everybody else ? - You 're darn tootin ' you can . I wanna be . Look who 's here . - How 'd you feel ? - Safe . - Good night , Sweetheart . - Good night , Daddy . Do you have a phone here ? Right over here . They 're here , they mailed some letters . All right , good deal . Get a hold of Bates , he can be there in an hour and keep me informed . - Mr. McGee ? - And Miss McGee . - Where are they ? - The summer cottage near Bradford . - I 'll bring them here . - Oh , just like that ? - You know what that little girl can do . - I know what the little girl can do . That 's why I 'll bring her here . So you can do all your tests . On the condition that you give her to me for disposal when you 're finished with her . What ? - I want her when you 've finished with her . - You are mad . How right you are . So are you , mad as a hatter . You sit here making plans for controlling a force that 's beyond your comprehension . A force that belongs only to the gods themselves . What the hell are you talking about ? Things I 'm sure you wouldn 't want the world to know . What 's to stop me from having you erased right here and now ? Hmm ! My word that I 've already made certain provisions that , should I disappear , The Shop will cease to exist within six weeks . And within six months , you will stand in front of a judge , awaiting sentence for crimes serious enough to keep you behind bars for the rest of your life . Just ... what is it you want ? Your word that my involvement with this child Charlene will not end when I bring her here . And that 's just the beginning . We 're going to be friends , Captain . - We haven 't got her yet . - We 'll have her . All right . I guess we 've got a deal . Why do you want her ? She 's very beautiful , she 's very young , yet inside her , is the power of the gods . We 're going to be close , she and I. Oh , yes , gonna be very close . Reel in some of the slack out of the line , real slow , come on in , a little more , reel it in , reel it , reel it . Okay , now give it a little tug , give it a little tug . Atta girl , now reel . Yes , sirree ! Whoa , whoa , whoa ! - A real whopper . - Lookee here , how about that ? Here he comes . Saved by the Postal Department . - What seems to be the trouble ? - Boy , am I glad to see you ? I think we got a dead battery , I was hoping maybe you could you give us a jump or something ? - Well , let 's take a look at it , it might not be the battery . - Thanks a lot , I really appreciate it . Where will we go now ? Offices of The New York Times . - But you sent them a letter . - Well , they might not have gotten it . Do you think they took them ? No ! - I 'll get it , Baby . - I can do it ! Baby , Baby , come on , now , it 's almost over . It 's never gonna be over . - It 's not over . - Come on . - No , it 's not . - Yes , it is . Come here . - Are you ready to go ? - I guess so . Daddy , I 'm never gonna start another fire in my life . Even if they come before we can get away . I 'm never gonna hurt another person in my life . That 's okay , Charlie , I can understand that . Okay . Jump ! That 's a big girl . That 's a big girl . Okay ... Charlie ? Charlie ! Charlie ! Oh God , oh God , oh God , oh God ! They shot my daughter ! Come on out where I can see you , you son of a bitch . Oh , Baby . Nothing to it . Charlie ! She 's all right , Mr. McGee , take it easy . Where is she ? I wanna see her . All in good time . First , let 's talk . Let 's get acquainted . Go to hell . I tell you , she 's gonna be all right . No ! No ! - What do you want with us ? - I told you , Mr. McGee , we 're going to be spending considerable time with each other and I want to introduce myself . I 'm Dr. Pynchot . I 'm going to make sure you 're treated well here . Is this The Shop ? This is The Shop . Hi , Charlene . - I 'm Captain Hollister , may I come in ? - Where 's my daddy ? I brought you some cocoa . I don 't want anything . There 's nothing to be afraid of ... here . You see ? Go on . Well , maybe later . I 've been looking forward to meeting you for a long time . I know you may not believe this but I 've actually begun to think of you as my own daughter . - What have you done to my father ? - He 's resting and he 's fine , just like you . And he knows you 're all right and he sends his love and he wants you to cooperate with us . You 're a liar . Now , what kind of talk is that from a nice little girl like you ? - Go to hell ! - Oh ? A very stubborn , nice little girl . That 's all right , I understand . I know you 're tired and you 're not quite sure where you are , or why you 're here . So I just want to ease your mind , Charlie . Do you mind if I call you Charlie ? All right , Charlene . You are here because I 'm very interested in this ability that you have . Pyrokinesis . Yes . All of us here are interested in that and we want to see how far you can take it . I 'll tell you this , Charlie , you 'll be doing this great country of ours a really big favor if you just cooperate with us . I said I would never start another fire in my life . I wanna see my father . Okay . Um ... Why don 't you drink the cocoa and get some sleep ? If there 's anything you want , just pick up the phone and let us know . I know you 'll find this hard to believe now , Charlie , but ... you and me are gonna be pals . Never . Never say never . I 'll see you , Charlie . Good night , Charlie . Back off ! Back off ! No ! You 're not gonna do it . Back off ! Come on , take these pills . Come on , swallow . - Now we have " So Red So Beautiful " . - Look what I have here . A wind-up cat doll . Listen to that , Sweetheart . Isn 't that pretty ? Huh ? Sure , you want this ... it 's all ... Hi , kid . You go ahead with your game , I 'll start in the bedroom . My name 's John . They call you Charlie , don 't they ? Hey ... Hey ... You wanna teach me how to play that because I 'm terrible at games , you can beat me all the time . You wanna teach me how to play that because I 'm terrible at games , you can beat me all the time . No . Where 's Charlie ? What are you doing with her ? I told you , she 's perfectly all right , there 's nothing to worry about . - Yeah , well , I wanna see her , goddamn it . - Just behave yourself . Do as we ask , we 'll see . You bastards . Are you gonna do the test or not ? Oh , sure , well , sure . Good deal . Oh , it 's a one-way glass , you won 't see us but we 'll see you . All right , send him in . - Hi , how are you ? - Having the time of my life , sit down . Did they tell you anything about what we 're supposed to be doing in here ? All they told me was to come talk to you . You look nervous . Thirsty , want some water ? Yeah , I 'm thirsty . You know , they mentioned something about a test . - Uh-huh . - You want some water ? No , I 'll pass . Why don 't you put some ink in it ? Put ink in it ? You gotta be crazy . - Goddamn it . - He 's tipped over . He 's been on the run too long . All those damn pills you 've been giving him haven 't helped . Just give me time . No , Rainbird 's right , he 's lost it and time won 't help . Increase his medication , I 'll decide what to do with him later . - Work on the girl . - Oh , I am . With a little luck , before long , she 'll trust me like a brother . Hi , kid , how are you doing ? Why do you come here every day , I 'm not messy ? It 's just my job , kid . Because they 're all full of shit , why else ? I wanna see my father . Sure you do . I wish I could help , I don 't even know where the man is . This is a big place , Charlie . They say they 'll let me see him if I ... if I do something . - And I don 't want to . - Well ... Can it be that bad , what they want you to do ? I mean , if just by doing it , you can get to see your old man . It is . Storm 's coming on . Sure hope those lights don 't go off altogether . No , Sir , I wouldn 't like that . Hey ... Listen . Are you scared by my face ? I mean , I could wear a mask or something . I 've seen worse . Kid ! Kid , please ! I can 't stand the dark . Please , kid . Kid ! - I gotta get outta here , you gotta help me . - Use your card . All the electricity 's gone , the card 's no good . Hey , let me outta here ! Hey ! Let me out ! - What 's the matter ? - Let us out . Hey ! There 's people in here . Stop it , we 're okay . I mean , aren 't we ? Yeah , I guess you 're right . It 's just ... it 's just the dark , I can 't stand it . It 's just like the place they put me when I was captured . - Who put you ? - The Cong . - Who 's the Cong ? - You mean to tell me ... ? Oh , of course not , you 're too young . It was the war , see , Vietnam . And the Cong were the bad guys , they wore black pajamas . In the jungle we were on patrol , walked into an ambush . Only about six of us got out . We ran . Went the wrong way . They caught me . Threw me in a hole in the ground . Like being buried alive . It was always dark like this . What did you eat ? They threw down rotted rice . Sometimes I 'd eat spiders . Live ones , great big spiders , I 'd chase ' em around in the dark and kill ' em and eat ' em . Gross . They turned me into an animal . You got it a little easier than me , kid , but it all comes down to the same thing . Like a rat in the trap . You think maybe they 'll get the lights back on pretty soon ? Doesn 't matter , we 're together . God , kid , if some day I could help you the way you 're helping me ... You could ... you could get a message to my father . You know , what 's it all about , Charlie ? Why do they have you and your daddy here ? What is it that they want you to do ? They won 't make me take any more pills . No more pills , you bastard . How are you gonna help Charlie if you 're a goddamn zombie ? Listen , maybe I could get in to see your dad ? You could ? You really think you could ? I could change with Herbie , one of the orderlies in the other wing . I mean , I could see your dad , tell him you 're okay ... well , maybe not tell him , pass him a note or something . - Oh , thank you , thank you . - Shit . Maybe you oughta light the damn fires if you can . I told you , it 's like letting a wild animal out of a cage . I promised myself I 'd never do it again . That men at the airport , those men at the farm , I killed them , I burned them up . Yeah , but the way you told it , it sounded like self-defense . Yes , but that 's no excuse . Also sounded like you saved your dad 's life . Look , if you do what they want you to do , but only as much as you want to do . It might just be the way for you to get out of here . I 'll help anyway I can . Oh , my ! Light ! Hold on here . I 'm sorry you got stuck with me in here , John . But I 'm awful glad , too . Well , you look like you could use a little rest , huh ? Come on , let 's try . Atta girl . There we go . That attagirl . You just relax and you 'll be asleep in no time . And you 'll have sweet , sweet dreams . That attagirl . Good night , kid . Good night . Daddy . Now , Charlie , you know what you 're supposed to do . I want you to go in the other room , I don 't want to have to look at you while I do this . Something might happen . Look at those alphas , she 's really jacked up . Everything all set ? Tape rolling ? - Everything all right with her ? - Yes . - You all set in there ? - Ready in here . Are we ready here ? Tape rolling ? Rolling . All right , everyone stand by . Go ahead , Charlene . Wood chips , they should 've given me something harder . Something 's happening in there . Temperature just jumped ten degrees . There it goes . Her alpha patterns look like the goddamn Andes . She did it ! By God , she did it and we got it all on tape . Back off , just back off ! Back off ! Look at the tub . Back off ! Did you see the water in that tub boil ? And the temperature ? - Jesus , did we get the audio ? - We got it . We did ? Good deal . My God , did you see what she did ? Did you see that ? My God , is there anyone here that has any doubt she didn 't make that happen herself ? Not at all , Chief , none . Holy Christ , I knew something was gonna happen but I had no idea . That tray actually flew and she controlled it . Then she put her power in the tub . And we got it , we got it all on tape and it 's good enough to stand up in court . Right up in the goddamned Supreme Court . What are you looking so miserable about ? You got her to do it by promising she could see her father again . Well , so what ? - She must never see him . - We never intended to let her . She 'll never stop asking for it . Suppose by some strange accident they get together . - Suppose they do . - She does whatever he tells her . Suppose he persuades her to destroy us all ? - No chance . - There 's always a chance . He 's right . They can never see each other again . Then you better send somebody along after her . Huh ? Your technician must 've had an appointment he forgot about . He went out of here in a hell of a rush . He also left the door open and your fire starter just walked out . Christ ... one of you men go and get her . Go on . Sure . Which of you would like to go and get the little girl ? Andy ? Here you go , ol ' buddy . Oh , good . Hey , listen , Andy , we 've determined that your power has deteriorated somewhat since you got here . In fact , we 've had no positive results at all . What do you expect with all these drugs you 've been giving me ? You expect me to do my best when I 'm stoned ? I did everything I could . I tried . I did everything I could . Oh , yes , of course I know that you have and believe me , I appreciate it very much . In fact , I think you need a rest . Now , did you know that The Shop has a small compound on the island of Maui in Hawaii ? How would it be if I sent you there for the immediate future ? - I still get my medication ? - Oh , sure , all you need . - Well , that sounds nice . - All right , good deal . Then I 'll get things started in that direction right away . You just take it easy , kid , we 'll take care of everything . She 's so beautiful , what 's her name ? Well , actually , she 's more of a boy , his name is Necromancer . What does necromancer mean ? I think it means something like wizard or sorcerer , something like that . They said if I did what they wanted , they 'd let me see my father . How did I know they were gonna be so damn stubborn about it ? I guess you have to do it for ' em again . - But when will I ever stop ? - Look , Baby . It 's like ... it 's like poker , ya know ! If you ain 't dealing from strength , you just ain 't dealing . Now , every time you light one of their fires , make sure you get something in return . This is your old Uncle John talking , you understand me ? Okay . What about this , what do you call it , this power of yours ? I know you were awful scared about it before , how 'd you feel about it now ? It 's different now , it 's a lot stronger . Yesterday , when I told it to back off , it did . It was like I let it out in a single straight line and then ... Then you pulled it back into yourself ? Oh , no , I put it into the water . If I pulled it back into myself , I guess I 'd burn up . When am I gonna get to see my father ? Well , Charlie , we 'll just have to give ' em enough rope . Next time , there has to be more water . Everything all set here ? Tape running ? All right , stand by . We 're ready when you are , Charlene . The temperature in the testing room should be minus 15 degrees Fahrenheit The temperature in the testing room should be minus 15 degrees Fahrenheit plus or minus five degrees . It 's 105 in there . - The blocks are starting to burn . - Cinder blocks . Back off ! Back off ! Back off ! Just back off ! Back off ! I wanna see my father . You better tell her something . Soon , Charlie . When you show us a little more . If you don 't let me see him now , I 'll make something happen . Do you hear me ? I 'll make something happen . Time for lunch . Well , instant banquet . Nice , table companion . I 'm telling you , we 're not through with testing her . You saw what she 's capable of , she hasn 't even reached her potential . Perhaps Herman would like to see her blow up a country before he gives in . I 'm scientifically rational enough not to form a complete opinion based on two experiments . And , I 'm satisfied , yes , but only partially . Have you made the arrangements regarding her father ? It 's all taken care of . Night , Doc . Rainbird . Have you considered what might happen if that girl found out whose side you 're really on ? Oh , yes , I have . I 'd say you stand a good chance of finding out what a steak feels like in a microwave oven . Would you shed a bitter tear ? No . No point in lying to you about that . When we find out all we need to know from her ... When you give her to me . What are you gonna do with her ? John the Friendly Orderly will come in . He will greet her , talk to her , get her to smile . John the friendly orderly will make her happy ' cause he 's the only one who can . And when John feels that she has reached the moment of her greatest happiness , he will strike her across the bridge of the nose , breaking it explosively , and sending bone fragments into her brain . It 'll be quick and he 'll be looking at her face at the time . He will know her power . And when he dies , which I hope is very soon , perhaps he can take that power with him into the other world . You ARE crazy . So , Andy , I 've made all the arrangements for you to go to Hawaii . - Oh , good , when am I going ? - Today . - Today ? - Well , eight o 'clock this evening . - How ? - Oh , first class comfort all the way . I mean , what 's taking me ? Oh , well , you go from here by helicopter to the base , then the rest of the way by army transport plane . Hmm . - Eight o 'clock ? - Eight o 'clock . You know , that could bite you . - What ? - That snake you 're holding . Christ , how did that get there ? I guess you just picked it up from a bush . I want you to contact that helicopter pilot . No . - Hey , guard . - Shut up ! Contact the helicopter pilot and tell him you 'll be coming along . No , I ... I won 't be coming along . Yes , of course I 'm coming along . - My daughter will be with us . - Oh , no , no , she can 't come , she 's far too dangerous . Oh , yeah ? Well , who do you think made her dangerous ? My daughter IS coming along . I don 't want you to contradict me again , do you understand that ? Yes , of course . You contact the helicopter and let him take us as far as the army plane . There has to be a refueling stop between here and Hawaii , right ? - Yeah , we 'll have to refuel in California . - Yeah . Okay . - Now , do you have paper and a pen ? - Sure . Here you go . I 'm gonna write something to my daughter , - and you 're gonna take it to her . - Yes , of course . Charlie , love . First thing , when you finish reading this , flush it down the toilet , okay ? Second thing , if everything goes the way I 'm planning , we 're gonna be out of here tonight . Third thing , I want you to be in the stables at eight o 'clock . I 'll arrange for somebody to bring you . Oh , I miss you , Charlie and I love you so much . - John ! - Hi , Baby . - I have to talk to you . - Yeah , what about ? I 'll tell you in the hall . - They listen here . - Right . Daddy 's found a way for us to get out of here . I 'm supposed to meet him at the stables at eight o 'clock tonight . - That 's great , how did he do it ? - I don 't know , but isn 't it wonderful ? Oh , it 's better than that , Baby , it 's a miracle ... I 'll take you . Oh , no , you 'd get in trouble , I wouldn 't do that to you , you 're my friend . I appreciate that , Charlie , but I 'd do anything for you . Hi , Charlie . My name 's Mike , and Captain Hollister has assigned me to take you to the stables tonight . What time ? Well , let 's see now . I 'll be back for you about quarter to eight this evening . So , what 's going on ? - I asked if I could go riding at night-time . - Oh ? Sure , kid , anything you want . - Bye . - See you later . Come to me , Charlie . Okay , let 's check you in here . Hey ! Anybody here ? - You can go now . - I got the kid with me . I said you can go now ! - Get out of here . - Can 't do it , Charlie . Back off ! Back off . Get out of here , you bastard , or I 'll burn you up , I 'll fry you . Charlie ... Charlie . John ? John ? - Where are you ? - I 'm up here . John ... I 'm really glad you 're here but if anybody found out ... That doesn 't matter anymore . The only thing that matters is you and me . How 'd you get Charlie to cooperate with the experiment ? - Rainbird got her to do it . - Who 's Rainbird ? He 's an agent , an exterminator and Charlene thinks he 's an orderly named John . Come on up , Charlie , come to John . - My father should be here any minute . - I know . Hurry , climb up now , come to John . That 's it , come on . Good . Good girl . Right . - Are you armed ? - Yes . - Charlie ? - Daddy ! Yeah ! Oh ! - Let me look at you . - Is it true ? Are we really going away ? Yes , it 's true , we 're going away . Baby ... You pushed him . You 're right . - My friend John is here . - The orderly ? Yeah , he 's up there . Couldn 't we take him with us if he wants to come ? He 's the one that shot us , Baby . He 's the one that brought us here . Oh , no , Daddy , that 's John . He took care of my room . No . He is with them . - It isn 't true , is it ? - Yes , it 's true . - Where are you , you son of a bitch ? - You tricked me , you lied to me . No , I just mixed up the truth a little , Charlie , and I did it to save your life . You come down here before I set everything on fire , ' cause I can do it . Oh , I know you can . But if you do , you 're gonna burn up an awful lot of horses . Can 't you hear them ? Necromancer 's in one of those stalls . No , I 'm not gonna do it . No , I 'm not gonna do it I 'm not gonna burn . No ! Back off ! Please , don 't , back off . You 're not gonna do it . Don 't . Back off . Back off ! What more do you want from us ? Why can 't you just let us go ? You can 't just be let go . I don 't think your father even believes that now . - You 're dangerous , Charlie , and you know it . - That 's not my fault . I know that , I don 't care about that , I never did . All I care about is you . Now , come up here ! Don 't make me shoot your father . - Don 't listen to him , Charlie . - You promise he 'll be all right ? I give you my real word . Don 't do it , Baby . - Are you sure ? - Yes . Kill him . Jump ! No . No ! Oh , Daddy ! Are you hurt ? - Charlie ... - Daddy ! Daddy ! - You 're bleeding . - Charlie ! Daddy ! - Look at me . - Go on . Charlie , look at me . That 's it , so I can see your eyes . I love you , Charlie . I love you . I say again , Condition Bright Yellow , this is not a drill . Repeat , not a drill . Converge on stables , use caution , it 's the girl and she 's using it . You gotta get away if you can , Charlie . If you have to kill anybody that gets in your way , I want you to do it . You let ' em know that this is a war , Charlie . You gotta get outta here . Do it for me . Do it for me , Baby , do you understand ? You make it ... you make it so they can 't ever do anything like this again . You 'll have to burn it all down , Baby . Burn it all down . Daddy ... Go on , get outta here before it all goes up . I can 't leave you . I can 't ... Oh ... I love you , Charlie ... Oh , no , Daddy . Get the door . Ready ? - Don 't move . - Freeze . Oh , my God ! Get her ! Get her ! - Run ! Run for it ! - Let 's go ! Come on , let 's get out of here . No ! No ! Take cover ! Take cover ! No ... Stop ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Attention ! Stay right where you are . Do not move . We 're coming down . For you , Daddy . - Irv , look who 's here . - Thanks for the ride . You 'll be safe now , Charlie . I 'm doing it , Daddy . I love you .

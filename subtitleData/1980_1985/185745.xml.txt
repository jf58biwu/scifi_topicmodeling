 ( THEME MUSIC ) ( SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) - Come on , Vila , you don 't mean that . - I know what I mean , and I mean no . At least think about it . Think about it . All right . I 've thought about it . No . - I can 't make you go . - That 's right , you can 't . But I can toss you off this ship . - What ? - You 're no use to me . I don 't have to be any use to you . I was here first . I was with Blake . I 've more right on this ship than you . No one survives this long without learning the facts of life . - The facts of life are ... - That I can dump you . The others wouldn 't stop me . And you couldn 't , could you ? Now I suggest you reconsider your decision . But don 't take too long . I 'm not a patient man . All my life , for as long as I can remember there 's been people like you . - And I thought I was unique . - You 're not even unusual . - I 'll need my equipment . - I 'll get it . You stay here . Check the teleport coordinates . At least you can 't bully a machine into doing what you want . What 's wrong with Vila ? - I scared him a little . - That must have been difficult . I had no choice . We 've got to have those crystals for the weaponry system . So we do a swap ... they give us the crystals , we give them Vila . They only want his help . Why are they insisting that he goes alone ? I don 't know , maybe outsiders make them nervous . - Did you ? - Me ? - Who could be nervous of me ? - Only Vila , it seems . We 've no reason to think they 'll harm him . And less reason to care ? Have you got the locator ? What locator ? They stipulated no surveillance devices . - So you said . - I gave them my word . - You didn 't give them mine . - Now you tell me . Are you suggesting we send him down there without a tracer ? No , I 'm suggesting we try and make sure they don 't detect it . They won 't . Well ? - " Well " is not a question . - Is it working ? The tracer is between the index and second finger of your left hand . Thank you , Orac . Let 's get on with it , then . No last minute protests , no sudden illnesses ? Look , I have to go down , he made that very clear . I don 't have to take any rubbish from you , all right ? All right . Take this . What is it ? Slow-acting poison ? It 's a tracer . Orac can locate it and tell us exactly where you are at any time . I 'm not swallowing that . It 's perfectly harmless . It dissolves eventually . - Your hands clean ? - Just take it . Orac , have you found us a name for this place yet ? No definite records exist . I have however found an obscure archaeological treatise ... which suggests the ancestors of the present inhabitants ... may have called their planet Kezarn . I 'm going to die on a planet that hasn 't even got a name anymore . - Ready ? - Does it make a difference ? They 're simple , unaggressive people . You 'll be safe . I 've only got your word for that . - Trust me . - Yeah . Put me down . I don 't know how you persuaded him to go . I appealed to his better nature . He hasn 't got one . Leave him alone in future . - Or ? - Do you want me to threaten you ? Why not ? I haven 't had a good laugh in ages . Sensible . You could die laughing . Why are you suddenly so protective towards Vila ? He 's irritating , but he 's useful . We can easily replace a pilot , but a talented thief is rare . I 'd agree with that . So ? So frighten him too much , he 's no use to anyone . - He wasn 't that frightened . - He was terrified . So terrified he might just get himself killed ... because it 's easier than going on . - I 'll take that risk . - It isn 't yours to take . Without the crystals , the main blasters are useless . - Do you like being helpless , Cally ? - I don 't know . I 've never tried it . - Liberator . Come in Liberator . - Yes , Vila ? The crystals are here . You can come and get them now . Well done , Vila . Killing range is only 200 , so aim for the whites of their eyes . No point in mentioning you 're supposed to be unarmed ? Put me down . Down and safe . There 's no one here . Are you sure , Cally ? Unless they 're hiding . But why should they hide ? I don 't know . Maybe outsiders ... Make them nervous ? Yes , you said . I 'm beginning to wonder how you managed to negotiate with them at all . Any sign of the box of crystals ? - Not yet . - Keep looking . Is that where we 're going ? It 's miles away . Why couldn 't I have teleported closer in ? Hey ! They say too much walking is bad for you , you know . Makes you go deaf . Look what it 's done for you . Listen , sooner or later one of you is going to have to speak to me . Well , speak to me one of you ! All right , that 's it . No speak , no walk . My feet hurt and I didn 't want to come anyway . Of course , I 'm totally lost , you realise that . Yes , of course you realise that . I don 't suppose you 'd consider taking me back to where you met me . No , of course you wouldn 't . All right , you 've talked me into it . There 's a box here . And Vila 's teleport bracelet . Cally , it 's Avon . Don 't touch the box . I don 't share Tarrant 's faith in simple , unaggressive people . Yes , I know . What was that ? Sounded like an explosion . Was it an explosion ? Do you know what it was ? Do you care what it was ? Do I care what it was ? Why am I talking to myself like this ? I wonder what it was though . They booby-trapped the box . Simple enough to do . They 're a simple people , according to Tarrant . And completely unaggressive . A slight exaggeration perhaps . I was sure we could trust them . I 'd have staked my life on it . - You did stake Vila 's . - Did I really ? I 'd forgotten . - Now he hasn 't even got a bracelet . - And that 's my fault ? So we haven 't got Vila and we haven 't got the crystals . What 's our next brilliant move ? We persuade his simple , unaggressive friends to part with either or both . We don 't , I do . This time I 'll negotiate with a gun in my hand . Orac , can you give me a precise fix on that tracer ? - Of course I can . - Where is it then ? Under the box which is 10 centimetres from your right hand . - The stupid idiot . - ( CALLY ) He palmed it . That 's not stupid , it 's suicidal . Why would he do that ? Because he was scared witless . He didn 't trust anyone . You were right . I 'm sorry , Cally . You 're the only one who 's met these people . Where do you think they 've taken him ? - What about that city ? - No , they said it was a ruin . No one remembers when it was built or who built it . No one ever goes there . So they say . We could wish for more reliable informants . Anything else ? There 's a name , something unpronounceable ... in what they told me was a fragment of the old tongue . A translatable fragment ? Apparently it means " the city at the edge of the world " . ( DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) The place is deserted . There 's nobody here . The whole place is ... deserted . Hello ? Anybody there ? Come on , stop dawdling , will you ? If this is meant to be a joke , it 's not funny ! ( EXPLOSION ) I 'll get you for this , Tarrant . I 'll tear your arm off and beat you to death with the wet end . I 'll get you for this ! Have you finished ? If talking got it done , you 'd be a real killer , wouldn 't you ? Where did you come from ? Here and there . Mostly there . On your feet , killer . I said , on your feet . Pick up your box and let 's go , little man . The name is Vila . You can relax your gun arm , I 'm not looking for trouble . What 's the matter , killer , lost your nerve ? That 's right . - Pity I didn 't lose my sense of smell . - What does that mean ? You should try taking a bath sometime , you smell terrible . For someone who 's lost his nerve , you take risks , little man . You didn 't go to this trouble to kill me . - Move . - Where ? There . - A mouthwash would be a good idea , too . - Move . Move . You bubble-brained idiot . You stupid son of a slime crawler . It wasn 't my fault , Captain . " It wasn 't my fault , Captain . " Of course it was your fault . " Oh , blow a hole in it , Captain . " Blow a hole in it . Look at it . It 's not even dented . It 's the only thing that isn 't . Well , it could have been worse . - Not for you it couldn 't , Sherm . - Well , I did my best . I know you did your best , Sherm . That 's why I can do without you . Please , Captain . Stop snivelling , Sherm . You know I can 't stand snivellers . It was his fault . He could 've told us how to open it . He 's been lying all along . He was laughing behind your back . I saw him . What ? Is that true , old man ? No one laughs at Bayban . Take him out and shoot him . Bayban , if you must kill somebody , kill him . - Then again , you don 't smell that bad . - What took you so long ? You must be Vila . - It 's an honour , sir . - The honour 's mine . That 's what I meant . You better sleep with both eyes open from now on . You should get together with Killer here . You make a good pair . I may have to get rid of Kerril . Be a pity , she 's the best gun hand I ever had , but ... she 's got no team spirit , you know . And you can 't run an outfit like mine without team spirit . What outfit is it exactly , if you don 't mind me asking ? Oh , I do mind you asking . - I mind very much . - I can understand that . I 'm sorry I mentioned it , I was just making conversation . I 've brought my tools here . What exactly is it you want me to do ? Just name it , I 'm your man . You don 't know who I am . No idea . You needn 't worry about it , I won 't ask any questions . Small-time thief and failed revolutionary and you don 't know who I am ? If you put it like that , of course I know who you are . You 're ... - Bayban . - Bayban , yes . Bayban the Beserker . Bayban the Butcher . Bayban the Butcher . You 're Bayban the Butcher ! - Oh , no . - That 's better . You 're top of the Federation 's Most Wanted list , after Blake . What do you mean " after Blake " ? I was working my way up that list before he crept out of his cr√®che . Working my way up . I didn 't take any political shortcuts . You have a reputation for straightforward mayhem that 's second to none . I 've been an admirer of yours for , well , for as long as I can remember . Well , maybe not that long , you 're not that old , are you ? Then again , you did start very young , didn 't you ? - I think I feel sick . - So you should , little man . Vila , I like a man who shows respect . You 'll enjoy working for me . Will I ? Oh , yes , I will . Of course I will . Good . Well you can start by opening that door . - Now ? - Now . - What 's behind it ? - You don 't need to know . - I decide what I need to know . - Yes ? - Yes . - I make the decisions around here . - The captain makes decisions here . - Why , you ... Sherm ! Vila , come here and sit down . Now I went to a lot of trouble to get you here . And that is all the trouble I intend to have . Now you will open that door , or I will open you ... from there ... to there . Right ? - Right . - Right . I need to know what 's in there ! The key to any security system is how it was designed ! That depends on why it was designed ! I have to know what whoever designed it was trying to protect ! Tell him . We have told you . Tell him . Sherm , contact the stockade . - Have the men kill two more hostages . - No , wait . Yes . - It contains this world and the next . - Same old stuff . - He did as he was told . - Two more corpses will keep him in line . - No ! You can 't push people too far . - You should remember that . - I said people , not garbage . - Garbage ! Kerril , Sherm . Out . This world and the next ? That could mean anything . Not anything , everything . There 's nothing on this planet , Vila . No precious metals , no gems , no wealth of any kind . And why ? Because it 's all in there . - This world . - And the next ? Religious mumbo jumbo to keep the locals out . We had to kill six of them before they 'd even tell us it was there . And six more to make sure they didn 't know how to open it . The crystals you swapped for me , where did they come from ? - They didn 't . - The crystals in that box . There weren 't any crystals in that box , were there ? Tarrant did a deal with you without even seeing the merchandise . Oh , not with me , with them . Tarrant didn 't even know I was here . But he did see a sample . I 've had it for years . Lucky piece . Not so lucky for him though . Wonderful . Me , he calls stupid . Not anymore . Smile . - You outlived him . - What ? We couldn 't let them go back empty-handed , could we ? - So we gave him a bomb to play with . - A bomb ? Yes . Bang . You 're dead . - You know the sort of thing . - Cally . - What do you say ? - Can I ask if you 've tried to blast this ? Blast it ? We blasted it , burned it , drilled it , cut it . - How long do you need ? - I don 't know . You 've got an hour . You , out ! Leave my man in peace . And you . My mother . Oh yes . I had a mother . Wonderful woman . Truly evil person . She had a saying . " Baybe " , she used to say . She called me Baybe . " Baybe " , she used to say ... " Treat every hour as though it 's your last . " I 'll be back in an hour , Vila . ( TENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) Tarrant , I hope you 're satisfied . - I still don 't see the logic . - Logic ? I know the ground . I made the contacts . They didn 't take you to their village or even that city . They deliberately kept you away from anything even vaguely strategic . Which makes your local knowledge very local indeed . That 's not the point . No , the point is that Vila won 't trust you , whereas he will trust Cally and me . - Cally , yes , but why you ? - He knows what I think of him . - You despise him . - Right . But at least I 'm consistent about it . I know his value to us , just as he knows mine . If we need any help , I 'll let you know . Feel free . - Just be ready . - We will , don 't worry . Put us down . Thanks for your support , Dayna . Well , they were right . If Vila saw you , who knows what he might do . - Run away , give the alarm ... - I doubt that . So do I. I think he 'd try and kill you . That 's what I 'd do . Seems quiet enough . The village should be in that direction . If Zen got it right . It 's a pity we 're not all as reliable as Zen . But I thought you were . That block isn 't really a block at all . He was clever . He could turn out to be the best I 've come up against . Who could ? The designer . My opponent . You see , there are two basic approaches to security . Physical , locks and booby traps ... things designed to physically stop you getting in . Then , there is the psychological approach . Like ? You put up a fence with a notice ... which says that the area is impregnated with swamp fever ... and you 'll get galloping knee-rot if you go in . - So which is this ? - I 'm working on it . - 0-0-2 . That is beautiful . - Is it ? An indestructible block . A combination of both , the psychological and the physical ... one reinforcing the other . Elegant , my friend . Simply elegant . So what is it ? Oh , it 's just a simple force field . I was right about you , another Sherm , all mouth . This is a solid block , little man . It 's a force field . Set to refract light so that it appears solid . Well , naturally it feels solid , all force fields do . Looks solid , feels solid , so everybody treats it as solid . They bash , blast , and burn it , and like all force fields , whatever ... energy you push into it , it chucks right back at you . For all energy input , there has to be an equal and opposite energy output . Result , an indestructible block . The harder you hit it , the stronger it gets . There . What 's that supposed to be ? - A low-energy probe . - What ? The energy threshold of this force field is 0-0-2 . Anything more than 0-0-2 gets chucked back at you , right ? This will push a probe into the field very slowly . Maximum energy , 0-0-1 . When the probe reaches the door , the field will collapse . Bye-bye block . - I 'll believe it when I see it . - It 'll take about 45 minutes . - How did you know I was here ? - Sorry ? When I first came in , how did you know I was here ? I heard you . No , you didn 't . Psychic . For a thief , you lie badly . Let me do it . I won 't scare her so much . All right , but be careful . Remember how they fooled Tarrant . And Cally , don 't get between her and me . Avon ! Seems we 're not the only strangers on this planet . That could explain a lot . The woman is still with us . Is she trying to bluff her way out ? I don 't think so . She just doesn 't care about us . It was the same when she first saw me . Polite disinterest . We 're not important to her . So let 's find out what is important to her . What were you looking so pleased about ? Bayban isn 't going to share whatever 's in there , you know . That 's true . Bayban will not share it . Where does that corridor lead ? Can we get out that way ? Now look , I 'm not the only one in trouble here , you know . I wouldn 't give a scoop of slime for you once I get that open . Bayban 's insane , you realise that . Once he gets his hands on the loot , he 'll kill us all . How many men have you got that can fight ? You better listen to me . I 'll tell him you were in here . I 'll tell him it 's all a plot . You 're just using him to get that open . Yes . You know how he 'd react to that , don 't you ? You don 't mean that really is what 's going on ? - That 'd make you crazier than him . - Crazier than who ? - You . - What ? - Baybe won 't be pleased . - Baybe ? It 's what his mother called him . What 're you doing here , Norl ? This man was to be left alone . Now get out and do as you 're told . You 've 25 minutes left . - Who told you that ? - Captain Bayban . I didn 't think you could 've worked it out for yourself . Just a joke . In 25 minutes from now , you 're going to need a sense of humour . Maybe you should lend me yours . They 're changing the guard over . Let 's find out where the rest are . You said 45 minutes , little man . Any time now . - What are you staring at ? - I 'm not staring . - We 've been on the move a lot . - Yes . It 's the first chance I 've had to , well , get cleaned up . Right . I know the problem . It 's difficult when you 're ... moving all the time . - Anything wrong with it ? - Not from where I stand . There 's nothing wrong with that , either ! - You did it ! - Of course ! For a little man I 'm a wonderful mover , wouldn 't you say ? Come on ! - Which way do we go ? - I don 't know . We 're shut in . Vila , we 're shut in ! Don 't worry . My man knows we 're here . - Your man ? - The designer . He knows we 're here , and he knows we 're not stupid . If we were , we wouldn 't have got this far . So , if he wanted to stop us , there 's only one way left to him . What ? ( SUSPENSEFUL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) According to the locals , this lot is thousands of years old . You sound as if you 're expecting to meet this character . He may be dead , but he 's still trying to outthink me . Keep behind me . Step where I step , and don 't touch anything . Right ? Right . What are you expecting him to do ? I 'm expecting him to try and kill us . - What ? - Come on . ( KERRIL SCREAMING ) - It 's all right , it 's all right . - Is it ? I hope so . ( AVON ) Grenade ! Don 't move . It must have been a dud . Sorry about that . All we want is information . We 've lost a friend of ours . We think you can tell us where to find him . That 's what we think . What do you think ? All the guards are in place , he can 't have got away . He must have done . I don 't see how , because we 've searched every tunnel . Take the rest of the men and search the whole city . I want him found , and I want him found now . - Go ! - You . When you were in here , what was he doing ? What exactly was he doing ? He had not opened the door . And he was afraid . He said that you were going to kill him . He was looking for a way to escape . Get two men down to the landing site . Get the laser cannon out and set it up in here . The laser cannon ? That could blow away half the city . Do it . I will have it open . I will have that door open . Another door ? Is this it ? Well ? - I think it 's time to go back . - Is it booby-trapped ? - No . - Well , then . - You don 't understand . - That 's right , I don 't . I know this man . If he was going to stop us , he would 've done it . The fact that he hasn 't means that he wants us here . Don 't you see ? We 're being used . That 's what Norl was hiding . - You really are a little man , aren 't you ? - Leave it , Kerril . - Whatever 's there , we don 't need it . - Try telling that to Bayban . - I 'm going back . Are you coming ? - No . - I think you should . - No . All right . Vila . Vila ! ( TENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) ( KERRIL SCREAMING LOUDLY ) Kerril . Kerril ! All right , my friend . But you didn 't fool me . ( TENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC CONTINUES ) - Vila . Thanks . - For what ? Following me . I always did have a weakness for nice legs . I 'm sorry . It 's not what I expected . He 's lost a lot of weight , hasn 't he ? Oh , there 's another one . It 's all right . It 's all right . - I thought I was alone . - You come and sit down . It 's all right . It 's all right . - I thought I was alone . - You come and sit down . The translator unit has identified your language as Terran ... and is translating my words into a form which I hope you will understand . I regret that we cannot meet in person , but by the time you hear this ... I shall have been dead for over 3,000 years . An almost unimaginable time . As unimaginable in its way ... as the journey in which you have now become involved . If you 'll please be comfortable ... I 'll try to explain what has happened to you . It 's all right . That 's my man . I want to see what he 's done to us . It is called Kezarn . Kezarn . And my people will have forgotten that by the time you hear my voice . As I record this , our society is at the height of its powers ... but economic expansion and social development ... are reaching their limits . A collapse to barbarism and a new Dark Age cannot be long delayed . We had despaired ... but now , we have found a solution . We have developed a system for the instantaneous transmission of matter ... over any distance between two terminals . Enter one terminal and step out of the other ... wherever it happens to be . The starship in which you now sit ... contains one terminal . The vault which you so ably penetrated ... contains the other . You 've stepped off the planet Kezarn and onto a starship ... which is now at least 3,000 light years away . One small step for man . So how do we get back ? The ship is programmed ... to find us a planet on which we can begin a new life . It must be a planet in a system with other planets ... which we can also colonise . This time there must be no limit to our expansion . We seem to be trapped . I think he 's killed us . The vault on Kezarn will protect that terminal ... during the generations of barbarism when my people will forget ... even who they are . All that will remain to them is a race memory ... which we have genetically engineered . Once in every 35 generations ... they will gather near the city at the edge of the world ... and one will be found who can enter the vault . My people will know peace only if he returns . He will return only ... if the ship has reached its destination . My friend ... if the ship is still in flight ... you will not return to Kezarn . I knew it . The air which came with you into this cabin will soon run out ... and you will die . Wonderful . Thanks a lot , friend . I suggest you make peace with whatever gods you recognise ... as I will try to make peace with mine . I bid you farewell . And I hope you can find it in your heart ... to forgive me . Not a chance . I 'd like to think he suffocated after that recording , but I doubt it . - Sorry , Vila , it 's all my fault . - No , you were right . Bayban would never have let me out without finishing the job . - How long do you think the air will last ? - Well , if we don 't move around too much . It hardly seems worth trying to stay alive a few minutes longer . If you 're thinking of shooting yourself or something , forget it . I don 't believe in suicide . It stunts your growth . Actually ... it wasn 't what I was thinking of . ( SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) He 's in worse trouble than we thought . Bayban 's as bad as you can find . - I 've heard of him . - I 've met him . He 's the type that gives crime a bad name . Right . That should put us down just inside the city . Are you sure those three guards can 't give the alarm ? Not unless they can do it in their sleep . - You should have killed them . - Probably . They could sleep through a war . That 's good , because if it is Bayban , a war is what we 'll have . Orac , are you ready to maintain teleport function ? Of course I am . Then put us down , and stand by for further instructions . Very well . Stand by . I 'm waiting . So are we . Teleporting now . Cretins . You are all cretins . I am surrounded by cretins . Vila and Kerril will be found and brought here to me . If Vila and Kerril are not found and brought here to me ... you will be the first to die . Now go and kick some life into the others . While you 've still got legs to kick with ! ( TENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) - Cally . - Dayna . Good . Good . Connect it up . Hurry . Try there . Over here ! I think they saw me . - How many ? - Three . ( SHOTS FIRING ) Three . Not very friendly , are they ? All right , keep them pinned down . I 'll go and get some more men . What 's that ? Something I 've been toying with . Heat-seeking ? I hope so . Make sure you point it in the right direction . Neevish , find out what that was . Move . You , too . Gaudy , but effective . I think war was just declared . ( LOUD EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE ) You . Give me a hand with this . Come on . ( SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) We 're still alive . Kerril ! Kerril , we 're still alive ! We should be dead by now . Are you bragging or complaining ? The air 's as fresh as ever . Do you know what that means ? We 're going to die of exhaustion . Here . The door should be here ! They walk out of the transmitter , straight out onto the planet . What are you talking about ? He hid the door , right ? To make sure none of his victims did anything rash ... like attacking the weakest point of the ship ! It 's here , I know it 's here . - Lf you say so . - How would he hide it ? - Another one of those force fields ? - Right . Set to refract light at the same frequency as the wall . - So it 's invisible . - Yes . Now supposing the ship has already landed ... but the force field has malfunctioned . Supposing the door is already open , but the field hasn 't switched off . - Why should we suppose that ? - Because the air 's still fresh . Air will bleed through a force field . Can we get through it ? If the energy threshold isn 't too low , and the field too thick . This one tried , but the air ran out on him . Ship was still in flight . - Can I do anything ? - Keep the sweat out of my eyes . - Right . - No , don 't do that . Your legs are bad for my concentration . ( VILA SCREAMING IN PAIN ) Vila . Are you all right ? Discharged straight through me . ( KERRIL ) Look ! Kerril . ( TRANQUIL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) ( SHOTS FIRING ) Get their guns . Drop the guns . Do it . Good . I hate to rush an execution . - You can 't use that in here . - Stand still . Both of you . You think I 'm a complete amateur ? A laser cannon isn 't very professional . - You 'll blow away half the city . - All the city . Energy feedback , heat reflection , you would go with it . - It 's an open ground weapon . - I do know that . You 'd have to be insane to use it , then . Well , maybe that 's it . Maybe I am insane . - Bayban . - Captain ! They 're wiping us out . We 've only seven men left ! ( INTENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) Finish her . Bloodthirsty little maniac , aren 't you ? Where 's Vila ? - I don 't know what you 're talking about . - You were rumoured to be dead . - Funny , that turns out to be true . - Do I know you ? Celebrities , they never remember the little people . - Where is Vila ? - Who ? Would you like me to let some fresh air into that rancid brain of yours ? Go ahead . You 'd be famous . The man who killed Bayban . I 'd quite like to be famous , too . How about the woman that killed Bayban ? Or better still , the girl who killed Bayban . I don 't know where he is . - You can do better than that . - He disappeared . ( NORL ) Only from your sight . We are awaiting his return . You mean he got it open ? He 's been in there all the time ? Dayna , take our guest outside and watch him . You know , Kerril , I really like it here . - I wonder what planet it is . - We 'll probably never know . - Perhaps we should give it a name . - Lf you like . How about , Homeworld . Vilaworld ? Homeworld . Vilaworld . - Yes , Vilaworld . - Homeworld . Stop . Where did you get this ? They 're all over the place , look . - Kerril . - What is it ? These are what got me into this . You 've no idea how much they 're worth . - We 're going back . - When you 're ready , there 's no hurry . Well , come on , we 've wasted enough time . Did I say something wrong ? Kerril , what 's the matter ? What did I say to upset you ? - Kerril . - What ? Homeworld , you wanted to call it Homeworld . Then we 'll call it Homeworld , it 's a good name . Are you playing games with me ? - Games ? - Yes , games . If you think what happened here ... gives you the right to treat me like some sort of ... Treat you like some sort of what ? I haven 't treated you like anything . We 're out there in the sunshine , when for no good reason ... you throw a tantrum and go off in all directions . - For no good reason at all ? - Give me a good reason . I 'm a reasonable man . I 'll accept a good reason . I 'll accept a bad reason . I 'll accept any reason at all ... just tell me what I 'm meant to have done . - You really don 't know , do you ? - Isn 't that what I just said ? Oh , please . Can 't we stop fighting now ? Of all the things I enjoy doing ... quarrelling with you comes 574th on my list . I 'm sorry . Shall we go ? That list . Things you enjoy doing ? You wouldn 't be interested in what comes top of it , would you ? You ! ( SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) Why is it getting darker all the time ? - How long are we going to wait ? - As long as it takes . Feeling guilty ? Yes , a little . There are no lighting systems I can find . I suggest we leave while there 's light to see where we 're going . - No . - Your friend is right . It is time to leave this place . Hello . Vila . Now that is what I call an entrance . Vila , we thought we 'd lost you . But every silver lining has a cloud . I 'd say you got it wrong , except I know you didn 't . - Welcome back , Vila . - Thanks . - Oh , this is Kerril . - And welcome back , Kerril . ( EXPLOSION ) What the hell is that ? What happened ? Bayban got away from me . - He 'll be making for his ship . - No ! Let him go . He has no men left . But there are still men guarding your people . They will have been dealt with . My people are coming . They are summoned to enter the city . ( BELL TOLLING ) That 's what this is all about ! This isn 't a city , it 's a travel terminus . And it 's announcing that it 's open for business . ( MYSTICAL CHANT ) The need which grew in us until it blotted out all other needs ... is now satisfied . My people are gone , and now I too must go . How much did you know beforehand , Norl ? Only that the door to the next world must be opened by a clever man . You tried to get Bayban to do it . He came to our world at the right time ... but he was not the right man . Although we realised quite soon that he could not open the door ... yet we knew that he could find someone who could . So , we encouraged him in that . By convincing him that the vault contained something of great value ... which you didn 't want him to have . It was no more than the truth . But it became more than the truth ... because some of us died before we told him . Vila , you 're a clever man , and brave . My people thank you . And now , I must join my people . Wait . May I come with you , Norl ? You too are brave , and have helped my people . You are welcome . You are both welcome to come with us . Well ? Vila , we 'll wait on the ship . Let us know what you decide . Bring us up , Orac . - Are you coming with me ? - I can 't . Why not ? It 's a chance to be free . You saw that place , it 's beautiful . But there 's nothing there worth stealing . No , listen . You know why I neutralise security systems ... open safes , and break into vaults ? It 's because I can and most people can 't . - To satisfy your ego . - No , not really . It 's just that , it 's what makes me , me . Kerril , a thief isn 't what I am , it 's who I am . Forget it . - You wouldn 't like what 's left . - What makes you think I like you ? Because you can 't like someone without them liking you back . And I like you , Kerril , more than anyone . Anyone I 've ever known . The difference is , I love you . - Kerril . - Very touching . Bayban . You didn 't think I 'd leave a fortune behind ? There 's nothing for you here , Bayban . I should 've killed you a long time ago , Kerril . Go quickly . - Vila , he 'll kill you . - Take her quickly . Get her out of here . Go . Go ! No ! Don 't do that . It 's a force field ! Get me out of here . ( DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) No ! ( DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC CONTINUES ) She escaped safely then ? Oh , yes . To a new life and all that . Good . We can all get back to business then . Not quite . We still have to find those crystals for the weaponry systems . ( DAYNA ) Avon ! That enough ? Yes . I 'm impressed . Wonderful . That makes it all worthwhile . Welcome back , Vila . Vila , I 'm sorry for what I said to you . I didn 't mean it . It wasn 't true . To tell you the truth , I don 't really care . It 's not important anymore . What 's the matter with him ? If I thought that was a serious question , I 'd be very worried about you . I think I 've just made the biggest mistake of my life . In the light of your previous record , that seems unlikely . I would predict that there are far greater mistakes waiting to be made ... by someone with your obvious talent for them . Shut up , Orac . Still , it 's a comforting thought . Let 's hope they 've all got good legs . ( THEME MUSIC )

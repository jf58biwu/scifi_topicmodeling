 Men of your stamp , Samuel Kemp , don 't know what real rage is . Nothing is going to stop me now , nothing . If you betray me , I shall kill you . I shan 't be long . ( DOOR LOCKING ) - Sir ? - One moment . Now , Listen carefully . I have no time to repeat myself . I want you both to leave at once . - What ? Dismissed ? - Of course not . I hope you 'll be able to return some time tomorrow . - Leave the house , sir ? - Just Listen to what I 'm saying . Don 't interrupt . - Have you any money ? - No , sir ! Damnation ! My wallet 's upstairs . - Well , there 's the housekeeping . - Take it . You can sleep at the Swan . - Do you know Colonel Adye 's house ? - Why , yes , sir . Take this note to him before you go to the Swan . Do exactly what he says . On no account are you and Cook to return to this house tonight . - Do you understand ? - I think so , sir . - Yes , sir . - Very well . Off you go . ( CLOCK STRIKING ) It 's me . It hasn 't taken you all this time to find that food . - I spoke to the servants . Perhaps you heard . - I heard voices , yes . Don 't worry , I said nothing about you . I simply said I was working late and didn 't wish to be disturbed . I often fetch food for myself at night . - Where are they now ? - We won 't be disturbed until morning . Eat before you drop . ( GRIFFIN EATING NOISILY ) ( DRINK POURING ) - How 's the arm ? - The bleeding 's stopped . - You should let me attend to it . - Later , later . When you feel able to continue ... Continue ? If I 'm to understand how you come to be like this . After you made the piece of cloth invisible , what then ? I had a visitor to my attic room . ( MIAOWING ) ( MAN SHOUTING IN STREET ) ( KISSING NOISE ) Come in , puss . Come in . Yes ! ( CAT YOWLS ANXIOUSLY ) Everything is ready for you . Come on , then . Yes ! Do you like milk ? Come on , then . Yes ! There we are , Look . There we are . Come on , then . ( KISSING ) Here we are . Come on , then . Come on , come on . Come on . There we are , then . - Come on , then . - ( YOWLING ) Come on , then , yes . There . Come on , then . - Come on , then . Yes ! - ( MACHINERY HAMMERING ) The essential phase was to place the object whose refractive index was to be lowered between the two radiating centres . - ( KEMP ) Like RÃ©ntgen ? - No , he discharges electricity through gases . - How Long did it take ? - Hours . Three or four . ( GAS ENGINE CONTINUES HAMMERING ) The bones and sinews and fat were the last to go , except for the eyes . - ( MACHINERY HAMMERING ) - ( MUTTERING ) Mr Griffin ! A living creature , Kemp . From that moment , I saw no drawbacks . I beheld a magnificent vision of all that invisibility might mean to a man . The mystery , power , freedom . - ( KNOCKING ) - Mr Griffin ! ( MACHINE STOPS ) - Yes ? - I 'm sorry to interrupt your work ... - You are interrupting . What do you want ? - Miss Hood , you see ... - What , again ? - The noise ! I 'm sick to death of her constant complaining . I 'm afraid the vibrations from your gas engine can be felt all over the house . The vibrations from a sneeze could be felt all over this building . This has always been a respectable house . It 's a slum ! The neighbourhood is rather disreputable , but I do my best . - ( MIAOWING ) - The cat ! - Cat ? - Miss Hood has lost her cat , you see . There 's no cat here . I dislike cats intensely . - But I heard it quite distinctly . - You are mistaken . I heard nothing . It 's all she has Left in the world , poor soul If I might just take a Look . It may have slipped into the room while your back was turned . Puss ! Puss , puss ! ( KISSING ) Puss , puss , puss , puss . Puss , puss , puss . Puss ! Puss ! - ( MIAOWING ) - There ! You heard it ! I heard nothing . Will you please leave ? Erm ... as you are a tenant of long standing , Mr Griffin , I feel it only fair to tell you , to warn you , for your own good ... - What is it , man ? Get to the point . - Miss Hood has spoken quite often Lately about the police ! The noise , you see , and now her cat . - I believe if she should fail to find it ... - Police . As you know , the Laws against vivisection are very severe . Vivisection ? Ach ! Damn cat ! She believes you are involved in its disappearance . Reassure Miss Hood that I have not been tormenting her cat . - My experiments do not involve vivisection . - What exactly are your experiments ? - Are they dangerous ? - No . - Are they legal ? - Good night . - Mr Griffin ! - ( KNOCKING ) This is my house , Mr Griffin . I have a right of entry . Mr Griffin ! L put the animal onto the roof when it came to . ( KEMP ) You mean , there 's an invisible cat at large in the world ? ( GRIFFIN ) If it hasn 't been killed . That wretched creature brought matters to a crisis . I 'd no idea what the landlord might do , but I knew what he had the power to do . ( MIAOWING ) The thought that my work might be exposed made me very angry and very active . Damn them ! Damn them all to hell . There was only one thing for it , and the desire was irresistible . What I had done to the cat I would do to myself . Thruppence ha 'penny , please . L knew my rooms would be searched . I had to take precautions . I posted my notebooks to a house of call for letters and parcels in Great Portland Street . It was all done that night , Kemp . It was terrible . A night of wracking anguish , of sickness and fainting . I had not expected the suffering . ( GASPS ) ( GAS ENGINE HAMMERING ) ( GASPING AND CHOKING ) ( BIRDSONG ) - ( KNOCKING ) - Mr Griffin ! ( WOMAN YELLING ) ( MAN ) Why doesn 't he answer ? Mr Griffin ! I must insist ! - Mr Griffin ! - Here , let me . I 'll open the door . It shouldn 't be allowed , ill-treating Little creatures ! Stand back . Calm down . ( ENGINE STOPS ) ( BOLTS SLIDING BACK ) ( GASPING ) What is it ? I have a notice of ejectment . Leave me alone ! All of you ! GO away ! What has he done to himself ? - Get rid of him ! - He 's Satan ! - Get rid of him from this house . - He 's the devil . - ( ALL SHOUTING ) - What is the matter with you people ? ( MUTTERING ) Mr Griffin ! Mr Griffin ! Can you hear me ? Mr Griffin ! Still under the influence of the drugs that decolourise blood , I began to destroy my apparatus . It must not fall into the wrong hands . Nobody must know what I had done . - ( GLASS SMASHING ) - Mr Griffin ! Can you hear me , Mr Griffin ? Come on out ! Mr Griffin ! What are you doing in there ? He 's breaking things ! I can hear ! He 's smashing the place up . Mr Griffin , stop that at once ! Mr Griffin ! What is he doing ? What are you waiting for ? Break it down ! - Are you afraid ? - Miss Hood , stand back . ( GAS HISSING ) Fire ! Fire ! Save him ! Save him ! ( MISS HOOD SCREAMING ) ( COUGHING ) - He 's gone ! - Impossible . He must be on the roof . Mr Griffin , are you here ? It 's hot ! Fire did deliberately , you ask me . - Water , water ! - It 's a bit late for that ! Come on ! Fire ! Fire ! If ever a man had , I had burnt my boats . The upper floor was blazing as I reached the street . Stark naked , I tried to dodge away , fearing that I might be trapped in the crowd . - Fire ' . fire ' . - But once free , - I experienced a wild impulse to jest ! - Fire ! The devil 's in your basket . ( LAUGHS ) Here , what 's going on ? ( SCREAMS ) ( GRIFFIN LAUGHING ) ( WHINING ) ( THUNDER ) Foolish as it seems now , I 'd not reckoned with the weather . When it began to rain , my euphoria vanished and I became inexpressibly wretched . I had no refuge , no one in the whole world in whom I could confide . The one thought that possessed me was to find shelter and food . Only then might I plan the new Life to which I was committed . Is ... is anyone there ? Er ... ( CHUCKLES ) I hope there 's no objection to my sharing your shelter . Hello ? Don 't be afraid ! Here , take my coat . Poor soul You begin to realise the full disadvantage of my position . Indeed I do . Why run away from an offer of help ? What harm could a blind man do ? To get clothing would be to forgo all my advantage . Surely you can see that ? - But you had to have covering . - And food . I was starving hungry , but to fill myself with unassimilated matter would be to become grotesquely visible again . - I hadn 't thought of that . - ( LAUGHS ) Nor had I. And the rain had warned me of other dangers . - The rain made a watery outline ... - ( BELL TINKLES ) " a sort of glistening surface of a man . The dirt from the street gave shape to my feet . ( KEMP ) What did you do ? Cheeky Little devils . Scallywags , that 's what they are . ( SNEEZE ) Who 's there ? All right , come on . Who 's there ? ( cows CHINK ) In less than fifteen minutes , I was ready to go forth into the world again , equipped .

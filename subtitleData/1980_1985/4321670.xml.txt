 I will not rest until my grandson is with me , where he belongs ! What am I supposed to do , shoot down a chopper ? You 'll do whatever is necessary . The boy and his friends go out to the woods , and nobody comes back . Coming through ! Carlos , the bridge won 't hold the weight . ( GUNSHOT ) Mike ! I 've got a visual . Locking infrared scan . Looking good . He hasn 't got a clue we 're on his tail . We could track a jackrabbit with heartburn with this thing . Check with Jo . Make sure the digital modem is patched in before we send the data . Good idea . About to proceed with digital infrared modem ... Link test . ( READING ) Very funny , Mike . ( TYPING ) ( SIGHING ) That ought to do it . Double link . Start sending now . JO : All right . Specifications entered and receiving visuals . Good job , guys . Piece of cake , my eye . Repo ! Repo ! You 've got an unidentified bogey on your tail . Acknowledge . ( BEEPING ) Uh-oh . I think he 's onto us . ( BEEPING ) Oh , you stupid ... PILOT OVER RADIO : You 're in restricted airspace . Indentify yourself . Does this guy really think we 're gonna tell him who we are ? Give me turbo , Mike . You got it . Locked and ready . Sorry , pal . ( BIDDING FAREWELL IN SPANISH ) We 've lost the connection with Jo . SAINT JOHN : Then patch through the phone . Good idea . ( CLATTERS ) ( TELEPHONE RINGING ) Who 's there ? Santini Air . MIKE : How 's it going , Watson ? Oh , Mike , forget the computer . I think I 've got company . Hang on , I think I caught a rat . ( BOBBY GROANING ) JO : All right ! Hey , get off of me , lady ! Let me go ! Calm down ! Bring the car around . Over there in that corner there , that 's where we put the Christmas tree the year my son , Roberto , was confirmed . Mama was so proud . Loved this house . I remember . These walls hold many memories . Not all of them so good . What is it they say if walls could talk ? ( LAUGHS ) If walls could talk , I 'd have to put out a contract on this whole house . ( SIGHS ) Still , it 's tough to leave , even retirement . Yeah , that 's great ! Just great ! You should be thanking Miss Santini and Mr. Rivers . You 'd rather be on probation ? Is that what you want ? Well , anything would be better than playing Daniel Boone with a bunch of grease-monkeys I don 't even know . Ah , Bobby 's got a point . I 'll just go back and tell the judge she made a mistake . You tell her you 'd rather have a rap sheet at 15 like your father ! Go tell her . Leave my father out of this . I don 't know what I 'm going to do with him . Oh , he 's not as bad as he seems . Mike 's right . Kids just test whatever boundaries you put before them . That 's where the Wilderness Program works . ( BEEPING ) MARCO : The explosives are armed . ( CHUCKLING ) Safer than traveler 's checks , eh , Marco ? It 'll take care of expenses in Mexico until the bank arrangements are completed . And the boy ? We 'll bring him to you in the morning . I 've waited 12 long years for this day . Make it clean . I 'll see to it . Are you sure it 's safe ? Bobby 's never even been camping . His father ... Well , his father died when he was three . None of these kids have any experience . They all learn together . Teamwork 's half the point . My keys ! I must have locked them in the car . JO : I think Bobby has just solved your problem . ( CAR DOOR OPENS ) Take him to the woods . Just don 't hold me responsible for what he does to the animals . ( SNORING ) The old man 's got a fortune strapped to his arm , we could just go with that . It 's wired , you idiot . Besides , that 's nothing compared to what we 'll get for the kid . By the way , thanks for the tie and jacket . Yeah , I just got it cleaned . So , what is all this stuff anyway ? You 've got enough gear here to storm the Himalayas . Hey , I 'm just like mustard . Prepared . What ? You were never a Boy Scout ? Never . I like my camping private and peaceful , just me and nature . And a bottle opener . That Conrad kid is going to be a real handful . You sure you won 't join us , Jason ? What , me in the woods with those hoods ? No way . Why not ? Just because the girl we 're taking along got arrested for biting the heads off parking meters ? All I can say is , good luck . ( SIGHS ) ( GRUNTS ) Hey , guys . Well , well , the gang 's all here . Jo Santini , Saint John Hawke . Carlos Cervantes . Hi , Carlos . What 's she ? The stewardess ? Watch your lip , Carlos . She 's the pilot . Thank you . Dwayne Hicks . That 's right , ladies and gentlemen . Dwayne Hicks . Hi , guys , how are you doing ? Ha ! This is a joke , man . I don 't have to be here , you know . Yeah , you could be sitting in the state pen . You just shut up , man . Hey , put a cork in it , guys . Thank you . And the beautiful and talented , Leigh Williams . JO : Hiya , Leigh . If I get airsick , it 's going to be your problem . Charming . Come on out , Bobby . Jo , of course , you know Bobby Conrad . I like to call him Chip . Well , campers , what say we all just get ready and go camping . You really going to fly that thing ? You bet . Oh , we 're dead meat . We 're dead meat . Coronado 's going to love this . ( HELICOPTER ENGINE POWERING UP ) MIKE : Come on . That means everybody . Let 's go . DWAYNE : Look , I don 't got to , man . It 's against my constitutional rights . You want me to empty your pockets for you ? Oh , no . Okay , man , here you go . BOBBY : So much for the constitution . MIKE : Yeah . I better get this back . Don 't worry . Plan on mugging a tree , Carlos ? ( EXCLAIMS ) Oh , Uncle Mikey , you 're going to have a swell time . Yeah . All right , let 's get packed up . Chopper 's waiting . Come on , you heard him , let 's go . What are you waiting for ? Go on . What am I supposed to do , shoot down a chopper ? You 'll do whatever is necessary . You listen to me . I will not rest until my grandson is with me , where he belongs ! JO : This is your stewardess speaking . Fasten your seatbelts . MIKE : Have a look down there , kids . You 're not going to see a scenery like this in the city . DWAYNE : Rocks and trees , man . Big deal . CARLOS : Open your eyes , Leigh , you 're missing all the excitement . LEIGH : Shut up ! BOBBY : Hey , stewardess , can 't this thing go any faster ? BOBBY : Hey , man , there 's snow down there . You didn 't say anything about snow . SAINT JOHN : Don 't worry about it , Bobby . The trail we 're going on is too cold for skiing . BOBBY : You 're kidding , right ? I mean , he 's kidding , isn 't he ? MIKE : So , what looks good , Arnie ? I 'd say down Paradise Ridge . Pretty rough in spots but nothing these kids can 't handle . ARNIE : Try that Capilano Trail . Sounds perfect , doesn 't it ? Let 's get this over with . Knock it off , Carlos ! Saint John ... Yeah . See you Sunday around noon , bottom of Paradise Ridge . If you come back alone , I 'll understand . Nah . Okay , let 's load up . ( GRUNTS ) According to the flight plan , they 'll be landing at the south ranger station up in Browning State Park . Perfection . We can use my old hunting lodge for a base . Does he know he is a Coronado ? If he doesn 't , he soon will . But if you 'll beg my pardon , Don Coronado , wouldn 't it be best to wait for them to return ? Marco , don 't you see how ideal this is ? The boy and his friends go out to the woods , and nobody comes back . It happens all the time . MIKE : So , what do you think of the Fab Four ? JO : Oh , I don 't know . I think they 're coming around . ( COUGHS ) Come on , guys , we 're burning daylight . Hey , you burn daylight , man . I 'm burnt out . You 've got lungs you haven 't even used yet . Come on , we 've got to find shelter before dark . Shelter from what ? Nothing can live up here . Are you kidding me ? Bears love it up here . They 've been following us for the last mile . Hello ! Hey , man , there ain 't no bears here . They 've got plenty of places to hide . He 's just trying to scare us . It sure worked for me . I 'm not scared . Yeah , me neither . Hey , I 'll race you guys . Let 's get out of here , man . ( COUGHING ) Okay , so is this great or what ? Just bury me here , man . ( SIGHS ) You 'll live . Just think of it as a test to see how much damage those cigarettes have done to your lungs . Man , I won 't live to get the results . ( CHUCKLES ) Homes . Speaking of homes , let 's camp over there . Okay , let 's pick up some firewood , huh ? I don 't hear any voices . You do it . I could be home watching the Celtics . You could be scrubbing toilets out in the reformatory . I 'll help you . Atta girl , Leigh . Let 's show these wimps how it 's done . Now , remember , booze and broads are the same as milk and eggs at the corner store . It 's all a matter of marketing , you understand ? I 'll keep the operation running . You 'll be proud of me , Don Coronado . I know . But watch your back . Those animals , they 'd start a war in a week and take it all down . There 'd be nothing left for Roberto . Roberto ? But I 'm to be the new Don ! And you will be until Roberto is ready to take my place . But I thought ... Marco , you 've been like a son to me . But Roberto is blood , my blood . You will serve him well , as you have served me . DWAYNE : Hey , Mike , where 's the beef in this stuff ? MIKE : You 're looking at it . It 's got everything you need . Proteins , carbohydrates , fats . What , you don 't like it ? No ! No thanks , man . I 'd rather drown . ( OWL HOOTING ) Mmm . It 's good . Man , I don 't have to eat this junk . Then I guess you don 't gotta be all that hungry , huh ? Oh , I want a double cheeseburger and a strawberry shake . Oh , and a ton of fries . It 's a long hike back to the golden arches , guys . It 's not that bad . All right , finish up , we 'll hit the sack . We 've got a lot of miles to cover tomorrow morning . Well , I ain 't bunkin' with the beaner . Who asked you ? Carlos , you and me . Dwayne , you and Bobby take one tent . And , Jo , you and Leigh take the ladies-only tent , okay ? Right . Hey , it 's empty ! What ? My canteen . How could you have finished all your water ? I didn 't . It was almost full . Hey , it was Dwayne , man . I never did it , man ! It was you ! It was Bobby . He lost his on the hike up . So what 's the big deal ? It 's only water . Take a look around . The big deal , Bobby , is water 's precious , okay ? I mean , you gotta make it last . If this was a survival situation , you 'd be dead . Smooth move , man . Shut up ! Okay , okay . That 's enough out of everybody . Lights out . Let 's hustle . Come on . I said hustle . Go on . Let 's clean this mess up , Jo . Mmm-hmm . Gee , this is more fun than I thought . ( CHUCKLES ) Thanks for spilling your guts , man . Look , Bobby , you had it coming to you . Yeah , sure , just blame me . Everybody always blames me . Bobby , why don 't you just shut up and go to sleep ? Hey , you know , I don 't have to hang around for this . Well , that 's fine by me . Jo , is Mike your boyfriend ? ( LAUGHS ) No . He 's just a good friend . We work together . Oh . Does he have a girlfriend ? ( CHUCKLES ) Take a number . Figures . ( LAUGHS ) Psst ! Wake up , wake up ! Carlos ! Mike ! Huh ? Bobby just left . Bobby 's gone . He took off . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) What the hell do you think you 're doing out here ? You don 't want me back there , man . I 'm only going to mess things up again . You mean , the water thing ? Yeah , the water thing ! So you screwed up , so what ? We 'll find more water tomorrow . You just can 't afford to be careless out here , that 's all . That 's it ? I don 't get it . Get what ? Look , I screw up here , I bust into your hangar to rip you guys off , and instead of nailing me , you let me get away with it . What 's the angle , man ? There 's no angle . Let me tell you a story , Bobby . When I was your age , I did my share of screwing up too , you know . Borrowed a few cars , hung around with a bunch of tough guys . Real wrong side of the tracks kinda stuff . Then I met this old World War II pilot who took me under their wing , and set me straight . He taught me to fly in more ways than one . You know what I mean ? He taught me to do things right . To be proud of myself . Is that true ? Nah . It makes a great story , huh ? Come on . Let 's get some sleep . Jeez , it 's wet out here . If one hair on Roberto 's head is harmed , you will pay the price . Understood , Don Coronado . I figure it , the old man should cough up a few mill to have junior back undamaged . I still don 't like the idea of wasting a bunch of kids . You can cry into your caviar about it when we 're finished . ( ENGINE STARTING ) ( TIRES SCREECHING ) SOUZA : Looks like the weather 's closing in . MAX : Never mind the weather . Let 's find that kid . MIKE : Who likes fishing ? I 'll bet there 's a 10 pound rainbow trout in that creek . LEIGH : Who wants to eat fish ? BOBBY : I caught a fish once . CARLOS : Where ? The supermarket ? BOBBY : No , off the pier with my old man . CARLOS : You couldn 't catch a cold . DWAYNE : Hey , man , do we ever get to go downhill ? MIKE : Once we 've crossed the gorge , yeah . LEIGH : What 's a gorge ? BOBBY : I think that is . You 're the second party in two days who 's been up here . I 'm not used to so much attention . Yeah , well , we 're looking for one of the kids in that hiking party . Family emergency . Oh , yeah ? Oh , you 're lucky , I know where they 're headed . Let 's see , they ought to be hitting low ground by now . Yeah . You won 't have any trouble spotting them from that access road . Appreciate the help , buddy . Yeah . Hey , what 's the holdup ? ( BRIDGE CREAKING ) Oh , God ! Oh , God , I 'm going to be sick . I hate heights . CARLOS : Go on , get a move on ! I 'm not scared . I 'm not scared . I 'm not scared . Oh , God , I 'm scared . Atta girl , Leigh , come on . One step at a time , Leigh . You can do it . Look , just don 't look down . JO : Look straight ahead , Leigh . Just hang on with both hands and keep moving . CARLOS : Don 't be a wimp ! MIKE : Shut up , guys ! Relax , Leigh , you can do it . Move it , thunder-thighs ! You 're a lot of help , Carlos . Leigh , you can do it . Go on ! ( BRIDGE CREAKING ) JO : Leigh , are you all right ? Coming through ! Carlos , no , stop it ! MIKE : Hey , get back there , Carlos ! The bridge won 't hold the weight . Come on . Shove over ! I can 't . Ow ! Ow , help ! I 'm caught . My foot ! Ow ! No , no , no . Let me go , let me go . I 'm lighter . Okay . Go easy . Hold still , man . Hold still . LEIGH : Hurry , Bobby , I 'm scared . CARLOS : Shut up ! Help me ! Pull your foot in , man . Come on . Oh , watch it , man . I can do it myself , man . I don 't need no help . You okay , man ? Come on , Leigh , I 've got you . Brains , Carlos . Dwayne . They got to be around here somewhere . Max ! Right there . Let 's go . ( COUGHING ) Well , this is it . It 's all downhill from here . It 's about time ! ( GUNSHOT ) Mike ! Nobody moves ! Nobody moves ! See if he 's dead . You , kid , come on ! Leave him alone . Come on ! What do you want ? Just a little family reunion between Roberto here and his grandfather . I don 't have a grandfather , man . That 's what you think , kid . Come on , Coronado 's waiting . ( GUNSHOT ) ( SCREAMS ) Stay back ! Souza ! Souza ! You , you 're coming with me . Come on ! Go ! Come on , kid ! Move ! Go ! What the hell are we supposed to do ? I don 't know ! ( GASPING ) Get in the Jeep . You , drive . ( ENGINE STARTING ) Don 't cry , all right ? I can 't help it . What the hell are we doing in this place ? Oh , great ! I don 't know . This is the boondocks , not the barrio . ( MIKE GASPING ) Hey ! Well , I 'm not too crazy about this neighborhood either . Mike ! LEIGH : You 're alive ! MIKE : Give me a hand , guys . ( GROANING ) DWAYNE : We thought you were dead . Yeah . Take it easy . My leg , man . We thought you were dead . Yeah , I 'd like another opinion . Survival Lesson 101 , okay . Don 't jump to conclusions . ( LAUGHING ) You 're out of your mind . Where 's Jo ? CARLOS : They took her and Bobby . What ? We got to get back to the ranger station . Come on . DWAYNE : Just take it easy . CARLOS : Hang on , hang on . That ought to do it . That 's a nice job , Dwayne . No sweat , man . I took first aid in the 10th grade , for simple credit . Are we going to make it ? I don 't see any quitters around here , do you ? Hey , thanks , Carlos . Let 's get you up , man . ( GRUNTING ) All right . Okay . All right . Let 's rock ' n ' roll , guys . ( LAUGHS ) Come on . Out ! You , get out of there ! Come on , move ! Move ! Hold it ! What are you doing ? What does it look like I 'm doing ? You and me have to talk business . Lose the hardware , Marco . Everybody inside ! Move ! ( MIKE GASPING ) Arnie ! ( GRUNTING ) They were looking for one of the kids . Yeah , I know . Look , hang on . We 're getting help , okay ? Don 't waste good help . I 'll be here . Come on . ( GRUNTING ) That 's a guy . ( GROANING ) All right . You must be out of your mind . Sometimes crazy pays off . Five million and you get to keep your grandson here . You 're digging your grave , Max . We 'll see who buries who , old man . MIKE : We 'll be all right . Arnie 's lost a lot of blood but we can take care of him until the ranger 's medics arrive . SAINT JOHN : What about you ? It 's Jo and Bobby that I 'm worried about . Did the kids see which way they went ? No . But it shouldn 't be too hard to track them . They must still be on the mountain somewhere . We 'll get after them . Hey , don 't take any chances with these jokers , Saint John . They mean business . So do we . Stay off that leg . We 'll check in from the air . He hurt you , Roberto ? No . Look , I keep telling you guys , my name is Bobby . Bobby Conrad . You were born Roberto Coronado . You 're my one , my only grandson . You 're Paulo Coronado . Smart girl , she reads the papers . Your mother took you away from us , just like she took your father away . My father 's dead . He died when I was young . Tell the kid the truth about you and his poppa , Marco . Shut up , Max . Tell Mr. C , here , how you had the kid 's poppa iced so you could line a place for yourself in the old man 's pockets . Shut up ! The Gambinis killed Roberto ! MAX : Yeah , but you set him up . What 's the difference between what you did and what I 'm doing now ? Make the call , old man . Five million . ( BEEPING ) ( ENGINE POWERING UP ) SAINT JOHN : What 's our ETA to Paradise Ridge ? Seventeen minutes and twelve seconds approximately . Did Arnie give you anything else ? They had a 4X4 . They can 't be too far . They said that they were taking him to see his grandfather , Coronado . Don Coronado ? MIKE : Yeah . Are you and the kids okay ? Yeah . Just find Jo , okay ? How long is it gonna take to transfer that money over to me ? If I were you I 'd worry about how long you 're going to live to spend it . Nobody 's going to find me . My people will . There 's over a million in here , Max . It 's yours now , no strings . Keep me if you want . Just let the boy go . I 'll take it all . Call ' em , Marco . Tell them ... Good , boy . Good . Now , Max , we see who buries who . Shoot , kid ! Shoot ! Give me the gun , Bobby . You 're no Coronado . And you wanted to give everything to this pup ? He 's just a boy . At least he 's not a killer . Yes , I don 't want a killer . I want a grandson . He 's never going to get the chance to be either one . I don 't need any avenging kids coming after me . I 've got a possible location on a lodge in this area . It could be Coronado 's . Let 's take a closer look . You did sell Roberto to the Gambinis , didn 't you ? Sure I did , and for what ? I took all the crap for him , and now you treat me like a delivery boy . It 's a matter of blood ! Let 's see some of that precious Coronado blood ! No ! ( GUNSHOT ) Run , Bobby , run ! ( GUNSHOT ) ( EXHALES ) Keep going ! Get down . ( HELICOPTER HOVERING ) He 's taking a ride . He won 't get far . How 's Jo ? She looks okay . Let 's nail this guy . Roberto . My grandson , Roberto . It 's me , Grandpa . Roberto . He must have loved you very much . ( GUN FIRING ) Looks like we 've got a marksman on our hands . Let 's see him outrun this . Guy just won 't give up . Aim for his briefcase . Maybe that 'll change his mind . Roger . ( SCREAMING ) What the hell was that ? Justice . If you want to be a pilot , you gotta know how these machines work from the inside out . Listen to her . She reads Miss Mechanic . Since you 're non-functional ... Thanks . Make sure you tighten the bolts . Mike , I really hate to bother you , but are you going to give us a little help here ? Oh , I 'm sorry , you want some help ? Um ... Bobby ! Bobby , would you mind giving these gentlemen some help ? Well , sure . No sweat . It 's nice having an extra pair of hands around here that actually work . Well , that will do then . Oh , no , no , no , no , we wouldn 't want you to reinjure yourself , Mikey . JO : Nasty wound that . Sure we can 't get you anything ? What , you think I wanted this ? What , I ordered this from some , what , catalog ? Whoa , whoa , whoa , Mike , Mike , we 're just pulling your leg . You stay away from me with that leg stuff . Bobby , working ? You guys have really turned him around . I can 't thank all of you enough . He wouldn 't even clean up his room for me . That 's ' cause vacuum cleaners don 't fly , Mom . MIKE : That 's no way to talk to your mother ! A piece of advice , if you will . Come on , Bobby . Mothers ... When I was a kid , my mom worked hard . Real hard . You want to know how hard ? We 're talking 24 hours a day hard . I used to have to sell brushes door to door . Tough ? Yeah , you bet . But , you know , Bobby , I learned something . About character , about being a man . 'Cause you see , Bobby , behind every man stands a mother at his side . No , that 's not it . Guys ? Guys , my mom didn 't really work 24 hours ... Well , she actually had a maid . Well , she worked hard to get the maid , but it wasn 't ... It 's no big deal , guys . My leg hurts here . Hello ? Bobby !

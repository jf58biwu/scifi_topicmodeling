 Who 's the boy , anyway ? Bogg , who is this guy ? This guy happens to be one of the greatest voyagers who ever lived . Kneel , dog ! Kneel in the presence of Great Kublai Khan . If Marco Polo doesn 't meet Kublai Khan , it 'll foul up Europe 's whole understanding of China . ( GRUNTING ) ( SOLDIERS CHEERING ) ( SOLDIERS SHOUTING ) The Karaunas ! SOLDIER : Run for your life ! Jeffrey ! Bogg ! BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! ( PLUMMETING ) Terrific . Another three feet that way and we would 've landed on the bed . Don 't complain . Three feet this side and it 'd be the birdcage . Whoa , I 'm freezing . New York . December 11 , 1930 . Recognize the date ? Fourteen days till Christmas . ( CHUCKLES ) That 's a lot of help . Nobody 's perfect . Hey ! Get out of there ! Hey ! Look out , kid ! Hey , what are you guys doing ? You chumps or something ? You could 've got youse moidered . We could 've got us what ? Moidered , moidered , moidered . As in dead . Right . Now get out of here ! Get out ! We 're going . We 're going . Okay , Charlie , take it up . Was that English ? Brooklynese . Don 't knock it . The guy saved our tubas . Our what ? Bogg , look . BOGG : Who is it ? A politician ? JEFFREY : Try physicist . That 's Albert Einstein . Einstein ? You mean E equals ... What is E equal ? E equals mc-squared . Right . Is he supposed to be here ? I think so . JEFFREY : I know he came here from Germany sometime in the ' 30s . Well , whatever 's wrong probably has something to do with ... Bogg , look . Youse , watch it ! It 's gonna fall ! WOMAN : Oh , my God . I 'm sorry , Mrs. Einstein ... Doctor ... I didn 't mean ... I mean , I hope I didn 't ... You hope you didn 't save us ? No , it 's just that I didn 't really mean to ... Yeah , well , say what you mean then . What I think he means is he hopes he didn 't hurt you . Exactly . Hurt us ? How much could hurt when you saved our lives ? Thank you . I am eternally grateful , Mr ... Bogg . Phineas Bogg . And this is Jeffrey Jones . Hi . I 'm a big fan . ( CHUCKLES ) A fan ? I feel like an American movie star . Oh , sure . We studied all about your theory of relativity at school . Energy is equal to mass times the constant , which is the speed of light , squared . Yes . It applies to light energy in relative time . You learned about light energy and relative time in grammar school ? No , see my father , he 's a professor . A physicist . That would explain it then . Such a smart boy . All right , youse , everybody out of here ! We got to clean up ! I 'm staying onboard the Belgenland . Pier 9 . You must have dinner with me onboard tonight . 8 : 00 . I could be talked into playing the violin . I don 't think ... We 'll be there . Good . Auf Wiedersehen . So nice to have met you . Come , my dear . REPORTER : Jeffrey Jones , smart kid . Dr. Einstein , does your theory suggest that time travel is possible , sir ? EINSTEIN : Time travel ? Yeah . I suppose that is a possibility . ( EINSTEIN LAUGHING ) I don 't know why you told him we could have dinner . Are you kidding ? Pass up a meal with one of the greatest minds of our time ? Well , I 'm telling you , forget it . I 'm telling you , I 'm hungry . ( DINGS ) Green light , kid . Now come here . Hey , there ! Come back here . No way . I 'm staying for dinner . Jeff ! Hey , you two ! Wait ! There 's no way , I 'm getting anywhere near you . Look , I 'll make it up to you . Don 't waste your breath . Hey , voyager ! Voyager ! Voyager ! ( PANTING ) You want I should have a heart attack or something ? You 'd think that you young tykes don 't have ears , the way you listen . Bogg , who is this guy ? Who 's the boy , anyway ? Wait a minute , who are you ? Me ? I 'm Isaac Wolfstein . You , you 're a voyager . But the kid , the kid I don 't understand . Since when do voyagers have little sidekicks to get in the way ? Isaac Wolfstein ? You 're not ... You couldn 't be ... Wild Man Wolfstein ? Well , not so wild anymore , but who 's to complain ? But you 're a legend . Barely in my time , maybe . Bogg ? This is Jeffrey Jones . I 'm Phineas Bogg . Bogg ? No , I 'm afraid that must have been behind my time . Bogg , who is this guy ? This guy happens to be one of the greatest voyagers who ever lived . Him ? Jeffrey ! No , no . It 's all right . Look at me . A pathetic old man in a uniform that needs pressing . Is this the proper end for a voyager ? I don 't understand . What happened ? Well , I retired . They took my Omni , they took my Guidebook , they handed me my pension fund and they said , " Where do you wanna go ? " And you picked here ? Oh , why shouldn 't I pick here ? In 1925 , this was a wonderful place to be . Beautiful city , beautiful women , beautiful stock market . Stock market ? You mean you didn 't know about ... What am I , a fortune teller ? I should know the stock market 's gonna crash ? But your Omni ... My Omni only went up to 1925 . Oh . Yeah , " Oh . " I lose my entire pension , he says , " Oh . " Look , I 'm sorry . You 're sorry . Everybody 's sorry . You work your whole lifetime for humanity , you sweat and slave , then you get old , and what do they do ? They throw you away and say , " I 'm sorry . " Bogg , maybe we should just skip dinner and get out of here . Wonderful ! It would be wonderful to get out of here . BOGG : Look , Isaac ... Take me anywhere . Only , there shouldn 't be any people . I hate crowds and money . Isaac ! Money , I 'm sick of dealing with it . Hey , hey , maybe there could be a nice beach . ( STAMMERS ) And some fruit to pick to eat . And some fishing . I like that . All right . All right . Look , we 'll drop you off on an island in the South Pacific . But after that you 're on your own , okay ? Bless you . May all your landings be soft . I thought I told youse guys to get out of here ! We 're gonna , we 're gonna . Gee , you didn 't have to do that . ( EXPLOSIONS ) Careful . Careful , watch his leg , Jennie . Yes , ma 'am . Watch it . Easy , Jennie , easy with him . There ! There ! There ! Try to make him comfortable . Try to make him ... I 'm going back to help the others out . ( PLUMMETING ) You want to know why old voyagers retire ? This is why old voyagers retire . Where are we ? This isn 't the South Pacific isle . Bogg ? BOGG : It 's stuck in the automatic mode again . So why aren 't you taking good care of your Omni ? This is what I get when I ask for sun and sand ? ( BEEPING ) Bogg , where are we ? You have to ask ? If you were old enough to have a brain in your head , you would know that this is a war . Eastern part of France . 1870 . Got any ideas ? You are going to ask a 12-year-old boy ? I think it 's the Franco-Prussian War . You think ? Why don 't you check your Guidebook ? Bogg , look ! Somebody needs help . Come on . Are you crazy ? Somebody could get killed out there ! On the other hand , wait for me ! Take it easy , easy on the leg . Anything we can do to help ? Yeah , just help me and Ms. Barton get them into the trench . We 'll fix the wagon when the shelling stops . Clara ! Everybody stay down ! I have to get her out of the wagon ! You stay put . Nobody moves . Wouldn 't think of it . Clara ! Get him out . You got to go now . Not until they 're all out . ( COUGHING ) Come on . Come on , help us ! Are you out of your mind ? Come on . I told you to stay back . Give him to us . Where 's Ms. Barton ? She won 't come until everybody 's out . Can I come help ? The answer 's no . I 'll die if anything happens to her . Did you say her name was Barton ? Yes , it 's Clara Barton . That 's it ! What ? Clara Barton founded the American Red Cross . There is no American Red Cross . There will be one . Here , take him . You 're gonna be okay ? Yes , I will be all right . I think I can make it out on my own . ( COUGHING ) Where 's Clara ? Right behind ... Clara ! Clara . Clara . ( BOMB WHISTLING ) Clara ! Clara ! JENNIE : She 's not breathing . That won 't work . Give me a shot . Hey , Jeff . I know what I 'm doing . I 've never seen this done before . Are you certain ? ( COUGHING ) You did it . You did it . And you say you learned that technique in a Red Cross program ? Junior Lifesaving Course . A lifesaving course . I never heard of such a thing . You will . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Your patients are all onboard and the wagon 's fixed , Clara . Thank you . I 'm sure they 'll receive much better care away from the fighting . Without you around , I doubt it . Do you have to go ? We 're just passing through . Right . We 're just passing through . See you , soldier . Bye . Bye . Coming ? Bye . Bye . Now , can we go to an island ? My ears are still ringing . Will you quit complaining ? Complaining ? Who 's complaining . Will you two guys grab on ? ( PLUMMETING ) Where are we , Bogg ? July 1st , 1946 . On one of the Marshall Islands . Well , could be a little bigger , but it 's better than the Bronx . Is the light green ? The light 's green . Is it gonna stay green ? Kid ? It 's gonna stay green . I don 't trust him . You should look in the Guidebook , make sure it 's gonna stay green . Look , I told you , it 's gonna stay green . World War II is over . The United States is in control of these islands . There 's nothing gonna happen for at least 30 years . Is it too much to ask you should check the Guidebook ? Look , just forget it . Did I say something wrong ? I just wanted to check the Guidebook . He is the Guidebook . Jeffrey , come back here . You mean that now they give you a smart-faced kid instead of a Guidebook ? I lost mine . ISAAC : You lost it ? Do you know what they could do to you ? You lost your Guidebook ? BOGG : I didn 't have a choice . My Omni fouled up and put me in 1982 . I lost my Guidebook , I picked up the kid , now I can 't get back , understand ? No . Look , the kid and me do okay . Jeffrey ! Then you should teach the kid to have more respect . These kids nowadays . Does he often run off like this ? You should put him on a leash . Jeffrey , come back here or I 'm gonna leave without you . You wouldn 't leave me here with him . Try me . That 's the way to handle a kid . Say you 're sorry . Sorry ? Because I wanted to read the Guidebook , I should be sorry ? Say you 're sorry or you 're going back to the city . The city ? I 'm sorry , already . I 'm sorry . I take your word for it . This is a wonderful island . Now shake . Now can we get out of here ? Now . Well , Isaac , nice meeting you . It 's been my pleasure . Bon voyage . Well , the sand 's not so bad . It 's a shame there aren 't more trees . Could die from sun poisoning without any shade . And there 's probably sharks . Water this blue always has sharks . So who 's to complain ? It 's better than the Bronx . ( PLUMMETING ) Alone at last . Where are we ? BOGG : China . August 13 , 1275 . You know you could 've been a little nicer to him . Was he nice to me ? Well , you could 've at least treated him with a little respect . I mean , after all the guy is a ... I know , I know , a legend . But I 'll tell you , for me , he was a royal pain . 1275 . You got any idea what 's wrong ? The date 's familiar . Well , I 'll tell you , kid , sometimes you just got to sit around and wait . Bogg ! What ? Bogg ? What ? I think you should see this . Hi , guys . Just catching a little shuteye . Kneel , dog ! Kneel in the presence of Great Kublai Khan . By all the laws of my empire , you should be dead by now . Sitting on my chair , looking directly at me when you speak , your mere presence in the royal garden , all are punishable by death . And yet , if you can answer one question , I shall allow you to go free . This one 's all mine . Where are my emissaries to the Christian Pope ? Where are the brothers Polo ? Take it , kid . Bogg , that 's it . Marco Polo 's supposed to be here . 1275 's the year he arrived . Well , don 't tell me , tell him . The Great Khan awaits an answer . Emperor Khan , are you saying the Polo brothers haven 't come yet ? Nine years ago they set out to bring the teachers from your Christian Pope and holy oil from Jerusalem . Three years ago , I received word that they were returning and had passed through Kirman . Then nothing . It was as if they had disappeared . Kirman , that 's in Persia . ( BEEPING ) You seem to be acquainted with the Polos . Tell me where they are now . We don 't know , Emperor Khan . Then I sentence you to die . Oh , but we 'd be more than happy to find out . ( BEEPING ) Hang on . ( JEFFREY EXCLAIMS ) JEFFREY : I can 't figure out which has worse fleas , this horse or this vest . See anything ? Maybe over the next rise . That 's what you said eight rises ago . I know . Oh , my tuba . We can 't give up . If Marco Polo doesn 't meet Kublai Khan , it 'll foul up Europe 's whole understanding of China . All right . The guy in Kirman said the Polos were only a half day ahead of us . They got to camp sometime . What if what 's happened to them has already happened ? If what 's happened to them has already happened , the Omni 'd be red . Right ? Right . Green . Great . ( MEN SHOUTING ) You hear that ? Sounds like it 's ... Just over the next rise . Come on . Come on . ( BLEATING ) ( SOLDIERS CHEERING ) Come ! Marco , don 't be a fool ! Give it to him ! What 's the matter with you ? This is the holy oil . Marco , we 'll trade a few horses and get it back for you . All the horses in Cathay won 't buy you a new head . ( GRUNTING ) That look like him ? Give it to me . Give me . Looks right to me . Stay here . Give me . Give it here to me . You can 't go in there . Are you crazy ? Excuse me . Hi . Look , I 'm sure this is just a misunderstanding . Now if you two would just step together and shake hands like gentlemen ... ( OXEN GRUNTING LOUDLY ) Is he with you ? God rest his soul . That 's not exactly what I had in mind . Couldn 't we just talk about it , maybe some other time ? JEFFREY : Look out . On the other hand , if you want to fight ... JEFFREY : All right ! Quick learner . Oh , no . Come on . Sure you wouldn 't like to talk about this ? Bogg , the pole ! The pole ! Grab the pole and pull . JEFFREY : Bogg ? BOGG : Jeffrey ? Are you okay ? Jeffrey , where are you ? Over here ! Over where ? Over here ! Come on , I think there 's a way out , but we 've got to find ... Marco . Good fight . Wonderful fight . Now , we eat . They call him Oxen , in the plural , because he 's bigger than any single ox . You 're a lucky man to have come out in one piece from that fight . You certainly saved our Marco 's head . How 'd it start ? We were on our way to the Great Kublai Khan in order to deliver some papers he requested from the Pope and a bottle of holy oil from Jerusalem . Is that what 's in the box ? Yes . Oxen , the Chief Tartar , admired it , and I refused to give it to him . So what ? It 's yours . Not according to Tartar custom . Here , if you have something which someone openly admires , you give it to him . Don 't let him see the Omni . The what ? Nothing . It 's just that I can 't believe anyone would make up such a stupid custom . That 's what Marco thought , too . That 's what got him into all this trouble . Well , I guess I have a lot to learn before I become any kind of a traveler . The first is to respect the law of the land one travels in . I 'll drink to that . Is there something wrong with my drink ? What is that stuff ? It 's ox milk and blood . Drink it with a smile . I just got something stuck in my throat . This drink 's wonderful . Every last drop , Bogg . More drink for my friend ! BOGG : You can 't be serious . Bottoms up , Bogg . Somebody give that man a medal . Dry fog ? The dry fog is up on us . Dry fog ? What 's the matter with fog ? It 's not the fog that 's the trouble , it 's what the fog brings . What 's that ? The Karaunas ! ( ALL CLAMORING ) The horses ! Get the horses ! They 'll come from the hillside . You there , get the men on the high side ! Hurry . ( SOLDIERS SHOUTING ) Bogg ? Marco ! Jeffrey ! This way . Follow me . Where 's Bogg ? Bogg ! SOLDIER : The Karaunas ! Run for your lives ! Bogg ! Jeffrey ! Come ! But I can 't find him ! Come on , boys , run ! Jeffrey , come on ! Bogg ! Come on . ( MEN SHOUTING ) There . This way . Jeffrey ! Jeffrey ! Jeffrey ! Jeffrey ! Jeff . Jeffrey ! ( GROANS ) Jeff . Marco ! ( BEEPING ) Jeffrey ! Jeff ! Marco ! Jeffrey ! MAN ... ( ON PA ) Blast area clear . We have blast area clear at one minute and counting . Fifty-five seconds . ISAAC : You lost him ? You lost Marco Polo and the young boy in the middle of Persia ? How could you possibly do that ? I already told you . The Karaunas . The Karaunas . So why don 't you find the Karaunas ? Because I don 't know anything about Karaunas . I didn 't even get a chance to see one . So why don 't you know something about the Karaunas ? You were sleeping when the subject came up in voyager school ? Yeah , something like that . MAN ... Test area is all clear of personnel . Forty-five seconds . Look , it 's a long story . Will you stop sounding like my mother and tell me what you know ? Well , it 's possible I could be persuaded . I 'll persuade you . I 'll persuade you until you can 't stand up . All right . All right . Don 't stretch the collar . I just wanted you should take me off this godforsaken little island . All range observers should have eye protection in place . Thirty seconds . There 's sharks in the water , nasty little crabs in the sand ... The Karaunas ! The Karaunas , right . The Karaunas is half-Tartar , half-Indian marauders . They use the fog in that region to conceal their attacks . What do they do with their captives ? Well , they kill them or they sell them as slaves . Where ? In that same region where you were attacked , possibly Hormuz on the Gulf . Thanks . It 's been my pleasure . Hey , you 're taking me with you ? I am not taking you with me . After all I 've done for you ? After all I 've told you ? You 're going to leave me on this miserable desert island with a bunch of nuclears ? Nuclears ? Yeah . The sign there . That 's what they 're testing . Hey . MAN ... 24 , 23 , 22 , 21 ... I don 't even know what a nuclear looks like . I 've been hunting all over the island trying to find one to talk to . And you 'd think they 'd have the common decency ... Nuclear testing ? ... to give a simple description . Bikini Atoll . MAN ... 2 , 1 . ( EXPLOSION ) And what was that ? That was a nuclear . And that nuclear , that 's what that boy of yours said was in a green light zone ? That boy of mine is named Jeffrey and it was a green zone . That was supposed to happen . It 's just that I didn 't put you on the right island . And where do you think you 're going ? AUCTIONEER : Do I hear nine ? To find Jeff and Marco . You want to come along , you keep your mouth shut . How do you expect to find him if you don 't even know what a Karauna ... I am as quiet as Grant in his tomb . What are my bid for this hand maiden ? I want 10 pieces of gold . Ten . Do I hear 11 ? Eleven pieces of gold . Twelve . MARCO : No ! You can 't have it ! Please , let the boy keep it . It 's only oil , for the blisters on his feet . If this is oil for his feet , why did he conceal it from us ? My mother in Venice gave it to me . Your mother , huh ? ALL : No ! We 'll take it to the auctioneer . Let him study it . Perhaps this is worth more than all these men and boy combined . And so ends the travels of the brothers Polo and young Marco . Even if we live , without the oil we can 't show our faces to the Khan . I 'm sorry , Uncle , Father . No , there 's nothing you could 've done . Thinking about your friend ? Oh , this is all messed up . You 're never going to make your journey . And I 'm never gonna see Bogg . He wasn 't captured with the others . Perhaps he got away . He would 've been here by now . Maybe he 's trying . A beautiful Venetian glass platter that just came in today . The color , the clarity . There can 't be a more beautiful example in Hormuz . Excuse me , I must do an appraisal . Will you stop that ? That 's a Karauna . Excellent . Genuine indeed . That 's it . Surely one of a kind . That 's the holy oil . AUCTIONEER : Now , back to our Venetian glass . So where are we going now ? If he 's got the holy oil , he 's also got Marco and Jeff . AUCTIONEER : There , I have a bid for two . Who will give me three ? You know the old coin trick gambit ? Know it ? I invented it . You got a coin ? ( SIGHING ) No , I 'm flat broke . Here , use the Omni . They 're making these things out of brass now ? What is the world coming to ? In my day , they were solid gold . BOGG : ( WHISPERS ) Will you come on ? Hello , there . Interested in a little game of chance ? This trinket against that scabbard ? Look at this , look how it blinks . ( BEEPING ) Yeah . Double or nothing ? Triple ? I thought you invented that game . Invented it , yes . Did I say I was any good at it ? Bogg ! Thank God ! How did you get away ? No time to talk , come on . I thought I lost you there . What 's he doing here ? If it weren 't for him , I wouldn 't be here . Let 's go . Come on . Phineas , help , the keys ! Are you hurt ? The keys ! The Omni rolled into the cell . Bat 's breath . In the cells ! Someone 's broken in ! I can 't find the right key . ISAAC : I think I twisted my ankle . CHIEF : Are you thinking of leaving ? ( BEEPING ) This is very interesting , very nice . See ? Little red lamp here . How does it do this ? It comes on and off with a bell . What is it ? I don 't understand . A time machine . A time machine . A time machine . Wonderful . This should bring good price , no ? Very good price . A time machine . A time machine . You always make jokes when you are in trouble ? It helps . I just hope you have a sense of humor when you go in front of the voyager board . You know what they do for a lost Omni ? ( GROANS ) My ankle . No one needs such pain . What no one needs is you . BOGG : Jeffrey ! It wasn 't Bogg 's fault . It was your fault . You 're the one who messed it up . You 're the one who lost the Omni . Hey , hey , hey , cool down , Jeff . No ! He 's a stupid old man ! Everything was going fine until he blew it . He blew it for everyone ! Look , Jeff , I wouldn 't have been able to find you if it weren 't for Isaac . Don 't defend me . Jeffrey 's right . I 'm a worthless old man . Somebody to get in the way . Wild Man Wolfstein . He 's a stranger to me . Somebody who lived a long , long time ago . On your feet . Manacles on the men and the older boy . We 're taking you to the auction block . Two objects for which there is no equal in this part of the world . The first is believed to be , the precious Christian holy oil from Jerusalem . While it may not have religious meaning to you , I assure you it is valuable . The second is a talisman of extraordinary mystery and power , reputed to have been made by a tribe of sorcerers on a faraway isle . He 's close . Maybe if they sell us together , we can get it back . They are not gonna sell us together . AUCTIONEER : This one will go for a price . I will not sell the objects now . I will give you time to look them over . I am sure you will bid for what they are worth . And now the slaves ! Bogg ! Fine young boy , soon to be a strapping young man . Who will give me two gold pieces ? Bogg ? I 'll find you , Jeffrey . Wherever you are , I will find you . Now that I have two , I want three . Three pieces of gold for this boy . Three gold pieces , here . This should never have happened . I want four . Four pieces . Four . AUCTIONEER : Five . Five pieces . MAN 1 : Here 's five gold pieces . I hear five pieces . MAN 2 : Six pieces . Six . I want ... ( YELLS ) Jeffrey ! The wagon ! Go get the wagon ! ( ALL CLAMORING ) Get him ! Oxen . ( JEFFREY YELLS ) Where 's Isaac ? Isaac . Go on ! Leave me ! No , don 't stop , they 'll catch us all . He 's right , boy . Go ! No ! Do what the kid says . Are you crazy ? Don 't stop ! Get as close to him as you can ! BOGG : Isaac . All right ! ( DINGS ) Look ! Now it 's green . MAFFEO : That 's a wonderful trinket . Unlike anything I 've ever seen . Are you thinking what I am ? That the Great Khan would like this , Father ? Marco , now you are thinking like a Polo . All right , Bogg , how much ? Sorry , Nicolo . We can offer you riches beyond your wildest dreams . At least that 's what Father and Uncle tell me . I don 't think it 's for sale , Marco . Jeff ? Isaac ? Thank you all . You 've made this a memorable trip . I think you 'll have plenty of things to remember before it 's through . Goodbye . ( DINGS ) ISAAC : Green light . That always gave me a special kind of feeling . It should . You 're the one who got it that way . Well , I had some help . You know , sometimes when you 're old , you forget what it was like to be young . You start to think that the kids don 't know anything , that you have to be old to have any wisdom . Me , from now on , I listen to the young ones . Even Isaac Wolfstein has got something to learn . Me , too . Just because someone 's old , it doesn 't mean they 're washed up . That applies to me ? You 've got plenty of Wild Man still left in you . Okay , Isaac , name your place . You 've earned it . Anywhere I want ? Anywhere . How about a place by the sea ? A city , a humble job , but steady , a decent subway . How about home ? It 's 5 : 00 already . I 've still got half my streets to do . Phineas . Jeffrey . It 's great to meet you , Isaac . Yeah . You should come back sometime for an egg cream . I know a great place near Times Square . You got it , Wild Man . You know , I 'm gonna miss him . BOGG : Me , too . What 's an egg cream ? It 's a drink . Milk , soda water , chocolate syrup . No egg ? No egg . Well , then why do they call it an egg cream ? You got me . Where you going ? To go have dinner with Einstein . Oh , no , you don 't . We got things to do . Yeah , like eat . Jeffrey ! Forget it , Bogg . I 've had enough of your beef jerky . Hey , come back here . No way , José . Jeffrey ! Jeffrey ! JEFFREY ... If you wanna learn more about the travels of Marco Polo or Albert Einstein , take a voyage down to your public library . It 's all in books ! Done by ( c ) dcd / January 2008

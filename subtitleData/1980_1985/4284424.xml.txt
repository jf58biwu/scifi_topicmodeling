 People all over the world are counting on me to make this flight . Mrs. Lindbergh , how does it feel knowing this may be the last time you 'll see your son alive ? Bogg , he 's not going to make it . Look out ! You 're really Little John and Friar Tuck ? That 's right . JEFFREY ... And there really is a Robin Hood ? Halt ! Ready ? Quick , over there ! Fire ! BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . Green light , kid ! We did it ! ( COUGHING ) ( COUGHING ) ( WIND WHISTLING ) Bat 's breath ! Spilled my guava whip . What are you laughing about ? And what 's the big idea Omniing us out of Hawaii ? I wasn 't ready to leave . Our vacation was over . In case you didn 't notice , I was having a very intimate conversation with a girl in a grass skirt . I noticed . BOGG : Well , did you also notice how beautiful she was , how sweet , how innocent ... How married . Married ? Married . To a tribal chiefsman . She was wife number 18 . Eighteen ! That doesn 't seem fair . A guy with 18 wives . He also had a couple of hundred warriors who were giving you the evil eye . Yeah , they were looking at me kind of funny , huh ? JEFFREY : Like the way they look just before they attack ? BOGG : Yeah , well ... England , 1194 . ( OMNI BEEPING ) Go away , or my next arrow will find your heart . This guy has a funny way of saying hello . MAN : Leave ! Go on ! We better get out of here , Bogg . Go ! Old guy looks like he needs some help . Then why did he shoot at us ? He 's probably afraid . Hey , it 's okay . We just want to help . I don 't want your help . Go ! Hey , kid . Yeah , Bogg ? This old guy 's a real good shot . You still think he needs us ? Yeah , for target practice . Let 's get out of here . ( COUGHING ) Bogg , we 've been walking for hours . Do you have any idea what we 're supposed to be doing ? You 're asking me ? This is great . We 're stuck in the middle of some forest with a red Omni , and don 't have any idea what we 're doing . Well , something somewhere in England is wrong . All we can do is find it . Yeah , well , we better find it soon . My feet didn 't come with a warranty . You know , Bogg , the Omni dropped us near that old man . Maybe he was important . And did you want to stick around and find out ? You there , make way for a better man . We were on this bridge first . Yeah , you should step back . You 'll be the one stepping back . Or I 'll tan your hide until it 's as many colors as a beggar 's cloak . Hey , don 't talk to my kid that way . Why don 't you do something about it ? Or would you be a coward ? Just push him off , John , and be done with it . We haven 't eaten yet . No , good Friar . I think this lad 's ripe for a contest of staffs . Lend him yours . As you wish . But do hurry , my stomach 's beginning to speak to me in strange tongues . Listen , Goliath , why don 't you just step back . I don 't want to fight you . You don 't have a choice . Okay , if that 's the way you want it . Step back , kid , I gotta teach this guy not to mess with a voyager . Bogg , be careful . He looks like an ape in a man 's suit . Come on , Bogg ! You can beat this guy ! Not bad , sir . You 're a fighter . Not as good a one as me . We 'll see about that . Well , he 's a dancer , John . Now let 's find out if he 's a swimmer . Come on , he 's a chump ! That 's it ! Come on , get him ! Again ! Look out ! ( EXCLAIMS ) ( JOHN LAUGHING ) ( SIGHS ) Good move . JEFFREY : Enjoy your bath ? It 's about time you had one . You really taught him not to mess with a voyager . JOHN : Good fight . I respect any man who can swing a staff like that . Yes , indeed . We could have used a man like you . My friends call me Little John . And this is Friar Tuck . I 'm Phineas Bogg . Jeffrey Jones . You 're really Little John and Friar Tuck ? That 's right . And this is Sherwood Forest ? Of course . And there really is a Robin Hood ? There used to be . Bogg , my dad told me that Robin Hood was just a myth . He said if the legends were true at all , they were based on some guy named Robert Hood . Right . Robin 's real name was Robert . He changed it when he became an outlaw . Wasn 't he the guy that robbed from the rich and gave to the poor ? Before he ran out on us . Now , John , don 't be so hard . Robin was one time the hero of all England . Too much ale has made you soft , Friar Tuck ! Well , if your Robin 's anything like the Robin I 've heard about , he couldn 't have done anything that bad . He ran out in the middle of an attack from Prince John 's men . We beat them off , but after it was over , Robin was gone . Doesn 't sound like the Robin I 've heard about , either . When he left , he took our hearts with him . No one had the desire to go on fighting Prince John or his sheriff . Now they have a free and evil hand . JOHN : England 's no longer a fit place to live . We 're on our way to France . And if you have any desire to live , you 'll go as well . Couldn 't Robin have been killed or captured by Prince John ? JOHN : We would have heard . Everyone knew of Robin . And now they hate him . Not I. And not you , I think . He was the bravest man we ever met . No to say , an archer without peer . Well , I don 't know about that . We met an old man in the woods today that could give him a run for his money . The guy could barely stand up but he shot an arrow straighter than I 've ever seen . An old man , you say ? Well , we didn 't see him up close . He might have just been weak , or wounded . Was his bow red in color ? I was paying more attention to his arrows than his bow , to tell the truth , but it looked kind of red . Made out of cherrywood , maybe . Could you take us to this man ? Sure . But when we get close , be careful . This guy doesn 't like visitors . Follow me . JOHN : Robin ! He 's burning up with fever . FRIAR TUCK : And his face is as white as a ghost . My friend . My God , Robin , why did you leave us ? I was wounded . Men should not see their leader in a state of weakness , so I came here to die alone . FRIAR TUCK : Headstrong even in death , eh , Robin ? ROBIN : Where are my men now ? JOHN : Your men are gone , Robin . Is that true , John ? It 's true . All your men have disbanded . Not to mention Lady Marian . Quiet , Tuck ! Yeah , Tuck , easy . Robin 's not well . What about Lady Marian ? Her heart grew so sad that when Prince John said that she must marry the Sheriff of Nottingham , she was too weak to fight . The ceremony takes place in four days . My Marian and the Sheriff ? So you just lie there and die . Good Tuck . Even if I had to crawl , I wouldn 't allow Marian to be forced into marriage . FRIAR TUCK : That 's the spirit , Robin . Here , let me take a look at that wound . BOGG : I 'll get something cool for his head . We should take him to a bleeder . I 've already been bled . Well , no wonder you 're so weak . What did they do , cut you and use those wormy things to suck your blood out ? Well , they used the leeches . JEFFREY : Stupidest thing I ever heard of . My mom used to give me soup to help build my strength . Do you have any soup ? Soup ? BOGG : Listen to the kid , he knows what he 's doing . I can shoot some game . Make a venison broth . Not to mention a nice roast . Oh , yuck ! This is all infected . Well , what do you think ? Is he gonna make it ? I 'll know better when I clean the wound out . I need alcohol . Well , I have some ale . No ! It 'll kill the germs . Germs ? They 're like little creatures that cause infections . JEFFREY : I need clean bandages . Boil some water and put the bandages in them . But the water is unclean . Boiling water kills germs , too . Do as the boy says . Got to bring down your fever . These germ things must be nasty creatures . I don 't think I 've ever seen one . But if I do , I 'll put an arrow right through its heart . How are you feeling , Robin ? Better , thanks to Jeffrey . I want you and Friar Tuck to do me a favor . Anything , Robin . Get my men back together again . Prince John 's tyranny has run free long enough . JOHN : We 'll try , but it won 't be easy . Most of your men think you 've deserted them . They 're scattered all over England . But Marian will be married in four days . We can attempt a rescue . Three men and a boy ? You wouldn 't get past the castle gates . Robin , your men won 't return until they know you 're back fighting again . Then I 'll do just that . ( GROANING ) Forget it , Robin . You can 't get up . Your fever will only come back . But Marian ... You can 't do Marian or England any good if you 're dead . You 've got to rest a few more days . In a few days I can help England , but it 'll be too late for my Marian . Not if I take on Prince John in your place . JOHN : What do you mean ? Well , if I dress like Robin , fight like Robin and use his red bow , maybe people will think that I am Robin Hood . It might work . ROBIN : Maybe . At least until I get my strength back . And the word will spread that I 'm back and the men will return . It 's worth a try . Yes ! To the new Robin of Sherwood Forest . SHERIFF : Are you enjoying our little ride in the country , Lady Marian ? MARIAN : As much as I would enjoy eating live lizards . SHERIFF : My dear , we 'll be sharing more times like this after we 're married . MARIAN : Then I 'll be too sick to do anything . SHERIFF : Of all my duties as Sheriff of Nottingham , I think I enjoy collecting taxes the best . I don 't remember you doing much of that when Robin was around . SHERIFF : Yes . The woods are much safer since he deserted his people . And much sadder , too . Wait ! Wait . Please stop . My leg , it 's broken . We wait for no one . The boy is hurt ! It 's Robin ! Guards , get us out of here . FRIAR TUCK : Get them , Little John . ( GROANING ) Save her , Phineas . Don 't worry . I 'll get her . I 'm coming with you , Bogg . No way ! I got the horse . Smart kids give me a pain . Good luck . SHERIFF : Guards , attack ! It 's Robin Hood ! After him ! MAN : Stop ! Halt ! ( GROAN ) Quick , over there ! Bogg , I think it 's Omni time . I think you 're right . ( BEEPING ) Shoot them ! Don 't let them get away . ( OMNI BEEPING ) Aim ! Fire ! Where 'd they go ? REPORTER : Hey , fellows , it 's Bixby . Mr. Bixby . How does it feel to be backing a dangerous flight ... Relax , boys , relax . Mrs. Lindbergh , how does it feel knowing this may be the last time you 'll see your son alive ? Did you know what a dangerous trip your son was taking ? Did you know a lot of experienced fliers have died trying to cross the Atlantic . Doesn 't that worry you , Mrs. Lindbergh ? Come on , how about a nice mother-son embrace . JEFFREY : That was great ! All that empty space and you land us right in the middle of a mud puddle . BOGG : I don 't have any control over the landing . You know that . You didn 't break Robin 's bow , did you ? No . But the Omni got quite a dunking . Where are we ? Just a second . What 's the day ? I 'll tell you as soon as I clean this thing off . I wonder what 's wrong . I wonder what the cure is for a kid that asks too many questions . Bogg , look . Mrs. Lindbergh , did you come here to talk your son out of making this flight ? No ! Please , please just leave me alone . I don 't need any Omni to tell me that pushing a lady around is wrong . MRS. LINDBERGH : Leave , Charles , please . MAN : Hey , that 's enough , fellows . Get back now . ( MRS. LINDBERGH CRYING ) Bon voyage . Let go of the lady 's arm . Get out of here . I said let go of her arm . Why , you stupid ... Ok , buster , now you did it . These hands are licensed weapons on five continents . Bogg , that move never works . Yeah , well , that move always does . Bixby , you see that Mother gets to the train all right ? BIXBY : Of course . Charles , I just talked to the other bankers on the phone , and they 're very disturbed ... We 'll talk about that later ! The storms haven 't changed in a week . Bixby , get her out of here ! Sorry about that , you guys . I didn 't mean to hurt anybody . Look at these guys , costumed bodyguards . He says he doesn 't like publicity . Does your mother know what a dangerous line of work you 're in ? Let 's have a touching embrace ? Why don 't you get a picture of this , send it off to your editors . That 's one for you , Lindy . Lindbergh 's revenge , huh , guys ? I don 't know who hired you to do that for me , but I 'm grateful . Are you really Charles Lindbergh ? Yeah , I 'm afraid so . I bet you guys could use something hot to drink . I 'd rather have some dry clothes , really . Come on , let 's go inside , see what we can do for you . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) Hot chocolate okay ? Sure . Thanks . JEFFREY : Bogg ! Do you know where we are ? I 'll check the Omni . Don 't bother . New York , 1927 . Roosevelt Field . How do you know ? That 's how I know ! BOGG : Nice little plane . Nice little plane , huh ? Yeah . Bogg , that 's the Spirit of St. Louis . That 's only the most famous airplane in all of history . Oh . Well , maybe something 's wrong with it . Red light ? Red light . Thanks to you guys , my mother was able to get away from this circus . Those reporters don 't know how they might scare somebody with their stupid questions . Anything for a story . And if there isn 't a story , they just go ahead and make one up anyway . LANE : Look , Slim , you better get used to reporters , they 're never going to let you alone . BLYTHE : Not as long as you 're on the ground , anyway . Well , that 's another good reason I get off the ground , I guess . These are the guys that take good care of me and the airplane . This is Lane , Blythe . I 'd like you to meet ... Don 't tell me . Peter Pan and Tinkerbell . CHARLES : Knock it off . These guys just helped me out of a real mess out there . I 'm Phineas Bogg . This is Jeffrey Jones . Hi . Hi . So , there 's nothing wrong with the plane ? No . Now we 're just trying to finish her up before we get the okay to take off . Listen , there 's some dry clothes over there . I can 't guarantee the fit . And you can stow your gear there , too , if you like . Thanks . MAN ON RADIO ... And that was Laura Sherman you heard , doing My Blue Heaven . But the heavens above New York are far from blue . The gray skies and stormy weather are supposed to stay with us until tomorrow . Listen , fellows , the weather 's going to break . I know it is . It 's going to happen . And soon . ( TELEPHONE RINGING ) Hello . Yeah , hi , Doc . He 's right . It 's gonna break . Doesn 't seem so sure . Yeah , but I 'm sure . Look . May 19th . So ? So , May 20th is the day that Lindbergh flew across the Atlantic . The first solo flight in history . He 's leaving tomorrow morning . Well , everything seems to be on schedule . Yeah . Then why 's the Omni red ? I don 't know . Goodbye , Doc . Hey , let 's knock off for the day . Yeah , we can finish in the morning . But you gotta finish up tonight . Mr. Lindbergh , you 're gonna leave for France at 7 : 00 a.m. Tomorrow morning . Look , kid , this weather is not gonna clear up for quite a while yet . But it 'll be clear by morning . Can 't you call and check ? That was Doc Kimball who just called . He said he 'd call if the forecast changed . So the weather 's changing ? Yeah , sure . Getting worse . Rain and more rain . I can 't stand this waiting around . I feel like I 'm never gonna get off the ground . CHARLES : I give up ! Bogg , he can 't give up . You do something . All right , I 'll take care of him . You better get these two jokers back to work if this plane 's gonna be ready in the morning . Mr. Lindbergh ? Mr. Lindbergh . Hey , wait , you can 't back out now . You know , it 's as if he knew for sure that the weather was going to clear . Well , maybe you should listen to him . I 've been holed up in a hangar for a week , waiting for the weather to break . I 've been waiting and waiting . Gives a man too much time to think . I have a feeling your waiting 's just about over . You sound as sure as Jeffrey . He 's not only sure about the weather . He 's also sure you 're gonna be the first man to fly the Atlantic from New York to Paris . Well , somebody is going to fly that ocean someday . I 'm going to show the world that commercial aviation will work . That airplanes can do more than deliver mail , and do stunts at air shows . Here he is ! Lindy . His names Lindbergh . Mr. Lindbergh . Oh . Mr. Lindbergh , what 's your reaction to this latest delay ? You mean the weather ? Come on , Lindbergh , just tell us what made you decide to back out of your flight ? Nobody 's backed out of anything . What are you talking about ? Word 's out your flight 's been scrubbed . ( WIND HOWLING ) You can 't let him do this . Come on , kid , we can 't stop him . But if he locks it up , the plane won 't be ready in time . I think I know what 's wrong . Wrong ? Bogg , it 's terrible . You gotta make him stop . BOGG : Hey , there 's Bixby . Bixby , what 's going on ? I just talked to the other backers . We all agree . We 're taking back possession of the Spirit . The flight 's off . Why are you doing this ? We just had some bad news . Nungesser and Coli , the French fliers , have disappeared over the Atlantic . Oh , no ! Too many men have already lost their lives trying to cross that ocean . I 'm not going to help finance your death . Well , don 't you think that should be his choice ? Mr. Lindbergh 's enthusiasm has blinded him to the dangers . Oh , now , we always knew it would be dangerous . Now with storms not only over New York but Europe , it 'd be suicidal . Bogg , it was Lindbergh 's weatherman who told him that the storms were clearing all across the Atlantic . Is that the Doc Kimball they were talking about ? I think so . Mr. Bixby , if Doc Kimball says the weather 's safe here and in France , then will you give your okay ? I 've already talked to Doc . He said he can 't be sure of anything at this point . Nobody can predict when this weather will pass . Especially all the way over in Europe . But I 've flown through storms plenty of times . No . We 're not taking off until Doc gives the okay . Maybe later in the day tomorrow . Bixby , you know there are two fliers waiting to get off the ground . By then they could have taken off already . Until Doc Kimball says there 's good weather from New York to Paris , no flight . If I wait for good weather all the way to Europe , I could be the last one to leave . I 'm sorry , Slim . BLYTHE : I 'm glad we decided to drive into New York . Have some dinner , take in a play . Not just any play . Rio Rita , and from backstage . Yeah . Helps to have friends in the theater . Yes , it ought to be great fun . You know , you ought to be back in the hangar getting some sleep . I can sleep in tomorrow morning . But you 're gonna be taking off in less than 12 hours . Jeffrey . Bogg , I 'm absolutely sure . You heard Bixby . No takeoff till he hears from Doc Kimball about the weather for sure . Maybe we can call Doc Kimball . We don 't need to call Doc Kimball for a weather report . He 'd call us or Bixby if the forecast changed . We 're gonna be late for the play . The way the forecasts have been ... No . Jeffrey , you and I need to learn when to give up . But we can 't give up ! Bogg , please ? You 've got nothing to lose in checking . Lane , pull up there by the diner , would you ? Look , Slim , you 're gonna disregard the weather reports , your friends , your backers , and listen to a kid ? Yeah . Yeah , I know it 's late . I know it looks pretty bad out there . Whoa ! Doc , slow down , what is it ? The weather 's clearing out of France ? ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) What about over here ? Yeah ! Yeah ! The storm 's finally breaking ! The low-pressure area over Newfoundland is receding and a big high is pushing in behind it all across the North Atlantic . Highs , lows ? What 's it all mean , Doc ? It means that the fog is lifting over most reporting stations between New York and Newfoundland . But it 's still bad out there . No , if there 's a low ceiling over New York , that 's all right , I 'll be flying right over that . What about the storms off the French coast ? It will be a sunny day . Just perfect for a stroll along the Seine . Okay , Lindbergh , you can take off tomorrow sometime . It 's gotta be first thing in the morning . I 've got to cross Ireland before nightfall , otherwise I can 't be sure I 'm on the right course . But you need rest . You can 't fly over 30 hours without a good night 's sleep . There 's no time . We 've got to work all night on the plane . Charles , there 's something I 've got to tell you . Later . We barely have enough time as it is . It 's going to take hours just to load the gasoline . But that 's what we have to talk about . Hey , kid . You did good , convincing Lindbergh to call the Doc that one last time . Green light ? BOGG : Omni is flashing red . I can 't think of anything else that could be wrong . CHARLES : You canceled the gasoline delivery ? I didn 't cancel it . I 've got the receipt right here . It 's all paid for . I just postponed delivery . CHARLES : Postponed it for how long ? Tomorrow sometime . It 's all loaded and ready to go . So , first thing in the morning . Tomorrow morning 's too late ! Can 't you tell the gasoline company to rush the delivery right over ? It 's way past closing . There 's no one there this time of night . Do you have a receipt ? Yes . Well , then the gasoline is really yours , right ? That 's right . Well , if they can 't deliver it , I 'll go over and pick it up . There 's the address . Be careful . They got a guard dog . No problem . Bogg , wait . Remember , animals can smell fear . Jeffrey , in case you haven 't noticed , I happen to have a way with women , children and animals . I give you two out of three . Don 't worry , I 'll have that pooch eating right out of my hand . ( SNARLING ) Let go . I 've dealt with your kind before , you know . I 've always lost . That a boy . Good dog . Now , I know what you 're thinking . A stranger , me , climbs over your fence here and drops , without warning , and into your territory . It looks kind of bad , huh ? Well , I 'm not a thief . Honest . In fact , I have a receipt . ( BARKING ) Brought this with me . See , paid in full . ( NERVOUS LAUGHTER ) You know any tricks ? Can you roll over ? Okay . I don 't know any , either . Okay , I 've tried to reason with you . But your mind 's made up . So I guess I 'll just have to make my move . You know , I 've always had a soft place in my heart for you guys in the animal kingdom . In fact , you know the story about Androcles and the Lion ? Well , who do you think really pulled the thorn out of the lion 's paw ? Androcles ? Uh-uh . Me . And Man o ' War , the race horse . Well , I once saved his tail . And there was this calf once ... Uh-oh . Sorry , dog . I hope you don 't lose your job . ( CRASHING ) He 's been gone for over an hour . Slim , if he doesn 't get here soon , we 're just gonna have to give it up . He 'll be here ! Even if he was here , it would be tough to load all 450 gallons of that fuel . If Bogg can get the fuel this far , I guarantee you guys will find a way to load it up . What 's this ? A change of clothes . You can 't land in France looking like a slob . I 'm not looking to win best-dressed . My flight suit will be fine . No , these are too heavy . I 'm going to wear the ones I 've got . Slim , you gotta have sturdy boots . I 'm flying to Paris . I 'm not walking . I told you guys , no parachute . It 's too heavy . Yeah , well , this just might save that stubborn neck of yours . It weighs about 20 pounds . I 'd rather have 20 pounds of fuel . Okay , let 's see . A quart of water and five sandwiches . Is that all you 're taking to eat ? Well , if I get to Paris I won 't need any more . And if I don 't make it to Paris , I won 't need any more either . He 'll make it . BOGG : Hi ! What 's everybody standing around for ? I got a truck full of gas outside that needs unloading . Bogg , you did it ! Piece of cake . But how did you do it ? Who cares how he did it . Now , come on , Bixby . You 're gonna help me unload this fuel . I 'm gonna get these banker 's hands dirty before I take off for France . Piece of cake , huh ? Well , they 're calling it a solo flight , but I wouldn 't even make it without the help of all of you guys . Good luck to you . A flier doesn 't need luck with weather charts as good as yours , Doc . Goodbye , Slim . Not goodbye . You , and all my other friends from St. Louis , you 're going with me . Mr. Bogg . If you hadn 't gotten that gasoline , the Spirit of St. Louis wouldn 't be taking off right now . It 's okay . It 's my pleasure . Your receipt . There may be a few extra charges there . But the gas was paid for . Yeah . But the fence wasn 't . Well , Jeff , almost time . If you hadn 't talked me into checking with Doc , I wouldn 't be making this flight at all . What 's wrong ? It 's just that this is a real dangerous flight . I guess I 'm scared . Me , too . Yeah ? Yeah . But I can 't let that stop me . Sometimes you just gotta fight through being scared and do what 's got to be done . I was scared a lot of the time when I was flying the mail . I felt like turning back , giving up . I mean , after all , what could be so important about a five-pound mail pouch . Then you start to think about the folks waiting for that mail . Parents waiting for a letter from their kids . Farmer waiting for word from the bank . And you realize people you never met , people you 're never gonna meet , they 're counting on you . So you just got to buckle down , and ... Bite the bullet . That 's it . Slim ! Time to go . Okay ! Okay , guys ! Lets roll her out ! Be careful . Don 't worry about me . I 'm just gonna follow the arrow pointing east all the way to France . I can 't miss . Let 's go . BLYTHE : I don 't know , Lane . That plane is awful heavy with fuel . You think he 'll get off the ground okay ? LANE : He 'll make it . Guess there 's no turning back now , Bogg . JEFFREY : Bogg , the plane 's too heavy . He 's not going fast enough . Bogg , he 's not gonna make it . No , he 'll make it . Up ! Up ! We 'll make it . BOGG : He 's off the ground . Now all he has to do is make it over those wires and trees . He made it ! He 'll make it . I knew it all along . Bogg , can we go watch him land ? England . No , he landed in France . I know . Gay Paris is going to have to wait . Robin Hood needs us back in Merry Old England . ( WIND WHISTLING ) Hope Lindbergh had a softer landing . Me , too . Hey , Bogg , look . There 's Robin . Robin ! How are you ? Very fit , thanks to you . What happened ? Well , we got away . It just took us a little while to get back . Well , you 're a pleasant sight . Two less people I have to worry about . And you 've got my bow . Where did you get such strange costumes ? Believe me , it 's a long story . We 're going to rescue Lady Marian . JOHN : There 's to be an archery contest today . It 's part of the celebration for the Sheriff 's marriage to Marian . Where are the rest of your men ? Well , they were supposed to meet us here by the falls . I had word that they were on their way . But we can 't wait for them any longer . Marian is to be married today . But you said yourself that three men didn 't have a chance . Yeah , you 're walking right into a trap . Maybe so . But it 's a chance I have to take . Then I 'm coming with you . I was hoping you 'd say that . I can use a man like you . We 'll do something about your clothes . I 'm coming , too . No way . This is a suicide mission . JEFFREY : But ... No buts . Remember what happened last time you didn 't listen to me . I need you to stay behind , Jeffrey . My men may return while I 'm gone . Someone has to tell them where we are . Okay , I 'll stay . Good lad . Be careful . Don 't worry . Piece of cake . Sure . For a suicide mission . ( SIGHS ) Good shot . You 're starting to get the hang of it . Do you think I 'm good enough to win the contest ? No . And I 'm not too sure about this plan of yours . You got a better one ? A splendid day for a capture . Don 't you think , Your Grace ? Better day for a hanging . Clever disguise our Robin Hood has on . He could have at least used a different bow . He 's making it much too easy for us . Here comes your lovely bride-to-be . My dear Marian . You look beautiful . I wish I could return the compliment . If only your angelic face did not house the tongue of a witch . Touch me again and I 'll stick a pin through your hand . She 's warming to me , Your Grace . SHERIFF : A week ago , she would have threatened to cut it off . She 'll change her tune when she sees her true love 's neck stretched at the end of a rope . What do you mean ? Why , Robin , of course . We have him . Robin ? He 's here ? Take a look at the second archer down there . PRINCE JOHN : Look familiar ? Perhaps his bow . Robin ! Keep your eye on where you 're shooting . You just hit the wrong target . All this talk of his great archery skill was much exaggerated . As were his exploits . He 's nothing but a common thief . If he were only that , you wouldn 't be going to so much trouble to kill him . He 's a hero to anyone who cherishes freedom and liberty . In case you haven 't noticed , the guards are starting to move in on us . I noticed . But we can 't do anything . Marian is still on the balcony . If Robin doesn 't make his move quick , we 're gonna all end up with our necks stretched . Aye . I think it 's time I dropped in on this little group . PRINCE JOHN : It can 't be ! MARIAN : Robin ! All right ! Good shot , lad . I 'll help Tuck with the horses . Robin ! Marian , go ! But ... But this can 't be ! You 're supposed to be down there . ( ROBIN LAUGHING ) ( GRUNTING ) Guards ! Robin is taking Maid Marian . Stop him ! SHERIFF : Guards . Guards ! Get him ! Robin , watch out ! SHERIFF : Get him , you fools ! Come on , men ! Fight ! Fight ! PRINCE JOHN : Yes , do something ! Prince John should recruit some better fighters . These are terrible . Why can 't they take them ? Surely they can 't overpower our men . PRINCE JOHN : Don 't let them escape . Come on , Robin .

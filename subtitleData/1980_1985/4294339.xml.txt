Now ! Our pulsars have no effect ! [ Man Narrating ] The year is 1987 , and NASA launches the last of America 's deep space probes : In a freak mishap , Ranger 3 and its pilot , Captain William " Buck ' " Rogers , are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life-support systems : : : And returns Buck Rogers to Earth : : : 500 years later : [ Wilma ] Anything about it look familiar , Buck ? Negative : I have never seen anything like it : Did you hear that , Dr : Huer ? Buck has just ruled out the possibility : : : It 's an ancient probe that 's fallen back to Earth 's orbit : Go easy on the word ancient , will ya ? [ Sighs ] Twentieth century : [ Wilma ] What do you suggest we do next , Doctor ? - Dr : Huer ? - Destroy it : We 're not certain that it 's unmanned : We can 't : [ Twittering ] Sensors indicate there 's no life-form aboard : Dr : Theopolis has just informed me that the object 's orbit has stabilized : Wherever it came from , it is now sustaining a position : : : Directly over New Chicago : We can only assume it 's some kind of weapon : So destroy it : ! Now : ! Yes , sir : Our pulsars have no effect ! The object has stopped tumbling : One of its points is ... is turning : - Towards the Earth ! - We must sound a general alert immediately : It 's glowing ! Dr : Huer , it 's releasing a beam of energy ! Activate Omega defense program immediately ! Dr : Huer ! - Sensors say it hit , Wilma : - Dr : Huer , are you all right ? We 're still here , Colonel : It hit outside the city : - Anyway , it started to tumble again : - [ Droning ] Let 's get back down there : [ Whispers ] Turn the lights off : The weapon works perfectly : We begin the annihilation of the Earth 's cities upon your command : There 's been a slight change in plan , Kane : I wish to send a subspace transmission to the Earth Defense Directorate : Those are not your father 's instructions ! Emperor Draco specifically stated ... I 'm not deaf , Kane : I heard my father 's instructions : I simply wish to make a few embellishments of my own : Come along , Kane : We have a transmission to make : [ Klaxon Beeping ] [ Man On P : A : ] Alert : ! Alert : ! Direct hit to Level 10 , Sectors " H ' " through " L : ' " Dr : Theopolis : [ Chirping ] What 's the latest on the weapons ? It 's still holding a position directly above New Chicago : - Hello , Dr : Huer : - Hello , Princess : Were you impressed by our target practice just now ? Well , I think you know that answer to that : One of our two-year expeditions to the galactic center discovered the pyramid : It was being used for mining by one of the planets there : Naturally , we thought it had far greater potential : - Naturally : - It really is the ultimate weapon , Doctor : You have no idea how it works or what can stop it : And you have no time at all to find out : It can destroy your space port and your city before you launch one ship : Then , why haven 't you done it ? Well , I prefer to discuss it with the Earth Federation Council tonight : [ Ardala ] You will arrange a reception for me : And you 'll invite not only all of your leaders , but Buck Rogers as well : - I 'm honored , Princess : - Well , hello , Captain Rogers : I must say , you 're still looking fit : So are you , Princess : I trust I 'll see you this evening : A lot more depends on it than you might think : What do you think you 're doing ? Your orders were to destroy the Earth : ! And your orders are to obey my wishes : If you cannot do so , Kane , I 'm sure I can find someone who can : They 're going to use that weapon to extort us : Doctor , I 'll need your help to locate Federation leaders : - Twiki and I are at your service : - Colonel Deering , if you 'll make arrangements : : : For an honor guard for this evening 's proceedings : Yes : Sir : - [ Sighs ] And , Buck ... - I 'll be there : Now , if you 'll excuse me , I think I 'd better go change : [ Disco ] Please hold still , Twiki : You 're loosening my circuitry : [ Chirping ] Killjoy : [ Continues ] [ Continues ] [ Final Fanfare ] [ Ends ] For the food , for the entertainment : : : And the for the hospitality , I thank you : As you know , we possess a weapon : : : Which is capable of destroying not only New Chicago , but each and every city on the planet Earth : Of course , being a merciful and civilized culture , we have no intention of doing so : : : If you fulfill one simple request : Very shortly , I will succeed my father to the throne of Draconia : And according to our laws , within a year of doing so , I must wed the most physically and genetically sound human male available : : : Or lose my throne to a successor : Well , I have found just such a man : : : Right here on Earth : And unless you turn him over to me for the wedding ceremony , our pyramid weapon : : : Will destroy the Earth city : : : By city by city : That man , of course , is Captain Buck Rogers : If I were your mother I 'd be admonishing you for not taking two trips : Yeah : Well , you 're not my mother : For one thing , my mother never had a key to my apartment : Well , I happened to run into a maintenance drone in the corridor : Seems like I 'm not the first person he 's let in here : Yeah : Well , you know how maintenance drones exaggerate : - What is all this stuff anyway ? - Oh , just some stuff I scarfed from Dr : Junius at the archives ... camping equipment mostly : I talked to Dr : Huer : The Federation has no intention of sacrificing you to the Draconians : For the time being , anyway , huh ? And Dr : Theopolis has a plan for destroying the weapon : I 'm going to sneak aboard the mother ship and try to locate the weapon 's control : That ship is two miles wide : Without a blueprint , you don 't stand a chance of finding that control center in time : No : The Federation won 't let you go : - Uh , are you going away ? - Yep : I 've never seen you run away from anything before : Well , you told me Dr : Huer and Dr : Theopolis have everything under control , so if Ardala wants me , she 's gonna have to come find me : I don 't believe you , Buck : We 've been through too much together : And you 've risked your life too many times for me to believe that : : : You 're running away from anything now : Whatever you have in mind : : : Please : : : Be careful : [ Whispering , Indistinct ] Where is Buck Rogers ? He chose to decline your invitation , Princess : It was hardly an invitation , Doctor : Oh , my dear Princess , you must understand that : : : Buck is from a different time : His attitudes are annoyingly old-fashioned : He 's very stubborn and terribly independent : As a matter of fact , I think he 'd make you a very bad spouse , Princess : Now , on the other hand , these two gentlemen have heard about your request : And they have volunteered to take Buck 's place : And they have done so , I might add , eagerly : I want Buck Rogers ! I don 't want psychological profiles : ! I don 't want personal opinions : And I certainly don 't want some drooling by-product : : : Of a Terran hormone experiment ! - I want what I came for : - As spokesman for the Earth 's Federation Council , I submit that we 're not going to give you Buck Rogers : Then , within one hour , you will suffer the consequences : [ Federation Members Murmuring ] [ Murmuring Continues ] Thank you , Twiki : [ Chirping ] Oh , and thanks for helping me overhaul that old motorcycle : I 'll let you know how it handles over long distances : Come on : I 'll walk you as far as the transport tubes : - Well , come on : I got to get going : - [ Chirping ] You 're not really running , are you , Buck ? No , I 'm not : I can 't tell you what I 'm doing : Don 't ask me why I can 't : - Then , I 'm goin ' too : - That 's out of the question : Twiki , I didn 't ... I didn 't pack any spare transistors : And Lord knows what you use for a toothbrush : Come on : Come on : I 'm wastin ' time : All right : I 'll leave you in here : It 's gonna get awfully lonely in here : Suit yourself : - All right : Come on : - [ Chirping ] Yippee ! [ Chirping ] Far out ! - Why are we stopping ? - I think we 're running low on fuel : Yeah , we need a fill-up : - Unleaded : There we go : - [ Sizzling ] - If only OPEC could see me now : - [ Chirping ] - Where are we going , Buck ? - You 'll find out when we get there : Whatever you say : [ Humming ] Marvelous : Every cubic centimeter : : : Of New Chicago lies at my fingertips : I can destroy it all at once or piece by piece : And if the Terrans turn over Buck Rogers , how are you going to explain your act of mercy to your father ? Once Buck Rogers is in my possession , and we have reentered Draconian space , we can always send the weapon back to Earth , and then act out my father 's missions : And once Rogers is within the empire , he need never know Earth has been destroyed : Very good , Kane : I 'm surprised at you : Did you think of that possibility yourself ? [ High-pitched Humming ] [ Panicked Cries ] [ Alarm Beeping ] [ Explosions Reverberating ] Are you all right ? A little shaken , but I 'm fine , Dr : Huer : I 'm afraid that was another hit inside the city : [ Twittering ] The pyramid has de-energized : [ Sighs ] Thank heaven : That 's right , Kane : I did no real damage : I changed my mind : Let 's see if the Terrans have changed theirs : [ Alarm Buzzing ] [ Ardala ] Next time , Dr : Huer , the damage will not be confined to the unoccupied levels of the Directorate Building : Unless Buck Rogers is delivered to me within two hours , the weapon will destroy all of New Chicago : This can only mean that the Federation leaders have failed to come up with a plan : : : To thwart Ardala 's weapon : - You 'll have to see them : - And I think I know : : : What they 're going to tell me : [ Chirping ] Nice place for a picnic : Well , that 's not what we 're here for , Twiki : Garridan ! Garridan ! Stay close to the bike , Twiki : I 'll be right back : [ Chirping ] I should 've stayed home : Garridan ! Garridan ! What 's a " Garridan " ? Garridan , I came alone ! Where are you ? I need your help : [ Chirping ] What am I , pickled herring ? Well , it looks like we wasted our time : Cheer up : - We can still have our picnic : - [ Fierce Yell ] You lied to me ! You brought ' em back ! You came to kill me ! - [ Buck ] Garridan , stop it : ! - You ... You came to kill me ! You 're like all the rest ! Garridan , I came alone ! Now , stop it ! Garridan , I came alone ! I promised I 'd never tell anyone where you 're at : And I kept my word ! Don 't you remember ? You came to me : You were tired of the fighting , tired of the Draconian slaughter : You asked me to help you : Don 't you remember ? Yeah : You found me supplies , and you found me shelter : You came alone ? Yes ! Why ? I need your help : Stop , right up in here : You were an engineer on a Draconian starship : You know their layout by heart : Garridan , I need that knowledge ! [ Stammers ] It 's so long ago , I don 't remember : Try ! - Please , Garridan ! Try ! - [ Garridan ] I can 't remember : - I don 't want to remember ! - The Draconians ! Deploy yourselves at once ! Garridan , please : Just try to ... Run ! I 'll draw their fire : Fire ! - How 'd you find me ? - I planted a tracer on Twiki : He didn 't know about it : Buck , I 'm afraid you 're going to have to come back with us : - We have no choice : - You 'll get no argument from me , Doc : - I don 't understand : - Garridan , I 'm sorry : I didn 't know they 'd follow me to you : - You know this person ? - His name 's Garridan : He was chief engineer on the Draconia : - Why should I help ? - Because , if you don 't , the fighting and killing you ran away from will continue and get worse : What do you want me to do ? [ Instruments Beeping ] Dr : Huer , I know how you found us , but , uh , what were the Draconians doing out there ? They homed in on the same tracer we did : Course they had no idea Garridan was out there : And they won 't : Not as long as we keep those guards under detention : [ Beeping Continues ] There we are : It 's the basic engineering design of a Draconian starship : Unfortunately , their pyramidal weapon is so new , we can 't be sure of the location of the control room : But if we were to analyze the power flow charts , Doctor , we should be able to come up with three or four possible locations : Dr : Huer , there 's no time for that : I must remind you that Princess Ardala is expecting Buck : : : To arrive in her chambers within the hour : Well , Dr : Huer , will you be kind enough to prepare a shuttle for me ? After all , we don 't want to keep the princess waiting , do we ? Good evening , Princess : Hello , Captain Rogers : It 's good to see you again : You 're looking ... Well , what can I say ? Thank you : I 'll take that as a compliment : - I assume you 've had a pleasant journey : - Very : Well , you couldn 't have been more punctual : Kane , inform the Royal Council and the witnesses : : : That phase one has begun , and leave us now : You too , Tigerman : I couldn 't be in safer hands : You never did have him leashed , did you ? Humorous as always : Mmm , this is lovely ! You 've had it redecorated since I was here last : It 's perfect for : : : First-phase stipulations : " Stipulations " ? Yes : Contractual requirements : Sounds very romantic : Well , for Draconian royalty , the act of formal union ... marriage in the Terran vernacular ... consists of three parts : Of which , phase one is the first part , I assume : And the most enjoyable : We drink , talk , dance : : : And get to know each other much , much better : In the days of antiquity , we called that " dating : " " Dating " ? It 's an old Earth courtship ritual : Boy meets girl , boy asks girl out , they go to dinner , a movie , dancing : And then ? And then later back to her place : Turn the lights down kind of low , Mm-hmm : Put a little music on the stereo , audio-visual entertainment center , break open a little wine , snuggle up ... [ Chuckles ] Tribal courtship rituals can be fascinating : Tell me : Just out of curiosity , what , uh ... What happens in Phases two and three ? In the second phase , you prove your worthiness for me : : : By competing in the arena with Tigerman : Mmm : Fascinating : I 'm not surprised that a man of your courage would feel that way , Buck : Of course , if you win tomorrow , the third phase will take place at noon : The great event itself ... the wedding ceremony : At which point , you will be given this : Princess , I 'm touched : So I see , Captain : And you 'll be happy to learn : : : That once it 's fastened around your neck , it cannot be removed : As a symbol of my eternal devotion : Eternal : As your loyal and loving husband ? Very loyal and very loving : You idiot ! I told you I didn 't want to be disturbed ! What are you doing ? Since they 've brought it , have them bring it in : ! Do you think disturbing me twice is better than once ? For safekeeping : [ Beep ] [ Case Buzzes Shut ] Sorry about the interruption , Buck : Mmm : Shouldn 't we : : : Share this with Tigerman ? After all , he 's gonna need all the strength he can get tomorrow : You 're going to need all your strength tonight : Hmm : Delicious : Antaraen brandy : To wedded bliss : To the most genetically sound and physically attractive : : : Human male in the universe : Tell me : That necklace , does it serve any other function aside from symbolic ? Well , let 's say it 's a gentle reminder of the eternal devotion you spoke of : If you should do anything that displeases me , an electronic signal will cause the band to shrink , tighten , constrict : : : To half its diameter around your neck : Well , let 's see , I wear a 16 collar : That would make it about an eight , wouldn 't it ? Specifically , Captain , it would make you dead within one-tenth of a second : [ Chuckles ] Let 's eat : I 'm starving : Buck should 've arrived on the mother ship an hour ago : He should already be in Ardala 's : : : Chambers by now : Unless , of course , the Draconian scanning devices detected the transmitter : : : And weaponry we hid on his person : Well , I was just trying to explore all the alternatives : Yes , of course : I know : - I know : - [ Chirping ] Buck 'll be okay : I hope so : God only knows what he 's going through right now : Do you feel ... What ? As good as I do ? Better : There 's just one thing that bothers me though : Oh , don 't let anything bother you , Buck : Well , yeah , but , uh , you know , when I become your husband and , uh , you succeed to your father 's throne ... Yes ? Well , it 's just that that kind of authority is : : : Pretty scary , you know : I just hope I can live up to what you feel a Draconian monarch should be : Well , you just let me rule the kingdom : All you have to do is what you 're doing right now : [ Clicks ] [ Swoons ] Thanks , I will : Night-night : [ Footsteps ] [ Twittering ] [ Buck ] Colonel : Dr : Huer , Buck 's activated his subcutaneous transmitter : Buck ? Ow ! Can you hear me ? Not so loud , Doc : This transmitter 's implanted a little too close for comfort : - Buck , are you all right ? - Yeah , I 'm fine : Security didn 't catch the transmitter or the black light bomb in my ring : Very well : Now , according to our calculations , the control room is on Level Five , Sector 12 : [ Inhales Deeply , Purrs ] Oh , Buck ? Kane : I want an armed detail sent to my chambers immediately : - Dr : Huer ? - [ Twittering ] - [ Buck ] I think I 've hit pay dirt : - Weapons control ? Right : Now , listen : Get on the ball back there , will ya ? I need to know the shortest route to one of the hangar bays : [ Footsteps ] Hold it , Rogers ! [ Twittering ] [ Grunting , Yelling ] [ Sighs ] You 're a stubborn man , Rogers : Maybe that 's what the princess sees in you : They told me they found you on Level Five , Buck : You didn 't try to get to one of the hangar bays , did you ? Not at all : I was simply taking a walk to clear my head ... all that brandy , you know ? Hmph : And to think that for a moment I believed you really wanted to be with me : The arena is ready : Captain Rogers isn 't : Tell him what 's expected of him : Using the weapons within the arena , you and Tigerman will do battle : [ Inhaling , Exhaling Forcefully ] You see , however symbolically , Buck , I must be won in order to be wed : - I 've seen you fight : You use your brains , - [ Growling ] Whereas Tigerman barely knows where his are : Of course , it is a fight to the death : If you lose , you die : [ Tigerman Growling ] Kane , inform the witnesses we may begin : Captain Rogers is ready now : [ Growling Continues ] [ Chuckles ] [ Laughs , Bellows ] [ Groans ] [ Chuckles ] [ Fierce Yells ] [ Tigerman Yells , Groans ] [ Groans ] [ Tigerman Yelling ] [ Pained Groan ] [ Groaning ] [ Panting ] I 'm not gonna kill him ! [ Grunting , Growling ] [ Growling ] [ Groaning ] [ Pained Growls ] I will not kill him ! Well , it 's obvious from Tigerman 's condition that Captain Rogers is the winner : According to the law , Princess , there is no winner until one of them lies dead : But it 's the spirit of the law that must be obeyed , not the letter : Isn 't that right , Kane ? I 'm glad you agree : Since there are no objections , the wedding ceremony will go on as planned : [ Whirring ] Dr : Huer , data from the Communications Directorate : : : Indicates the weapon is leaving Earth orbit : Well , for what it 's worth , they seem to be keeping their word : It might interest you to know : : : The pyramid is in defensive orbit of this ship rather than Earth : - You see , we do keep our word : - How 's it feel , Kane ? Having been Draco 's right-hand man for all these years : : : And then seeing not only the Draconian throne : : : But Ardala herself given to another man , hmm ? Why don 't you use that weapon against Draco ? It 's his empire you want , not the Earth : I 'll simply wait for the inevitable , Captain Rogers ... your execution : [ Buttons Beeping ] Let us begin : - You look marvelous , Buck : - Thank you : So do you : Kane ? As minister of my father 's extraplanetary affairs , Kane will conduct the ceremony : Those who are about to be joined , prepare yourselves : At least the Draconians did not discover Buck 's transmitter implant : He 's stationary in Ardala 's chamber : [ Takes Deep Breath ] That must mean the ceremony 's underway : We shall commence with the sacred ritual of phase three : - Talk about shotgun weddings : - [ Kane ] Having been singled out : : : By the Royal Council of Draconia : : : And having proved your worthiness in battle , you will bejoined with Princess Ardala : : : Forever : [ Onlookers Gasping ] [ Commotion Subsides ] After him ! - He 's moving ! - [ Twittering ] [ Chirping ] Attaboy , Buck ! [ Man On P : A : ] Intruder alert in Sector " G : ' " [ Alarm Beeping ] All security personnel ... turbolift six , seven and nine : Doc : Wilma : Can you hear me ? Yes ! Perfectly , Buck : Are you all right ? I 'll let you know in a minute : Intercept unauthorized personnel immediately : ! Yahoo ! He 's gonna make it ! Ooh ! [ Laughing ] [ Chuckling ] Oh : Security Team Seven , block off all access portals at once : After him ! Repeat ... intruder alert in Sector " G : ' " - [ Klaxon Buzzing ] - [ Electronic Squeal ] [ Tone Sounds ] - [ Twittering ] - [ Power Humming ] [ Sighs ] All right , gang : I 'm in the control center : [ Chirping ] Yippee ! All right : Power 's building up , Theo : How about some advice , huh ? What you 're trying to do , Buck , is to build up a maximum charge : : : - And give it nowhere to go : - [ High-pitched Whirring ] [ Klaxon Buzzing ] He 's in there ! Open it ! Fire ! [ High-pitched Whining ] He 's destroying the weapon ! Do something ! - All right , Doc : I 'm gettin ' a power feedback now : - Buck , get out of there : Bring him here ! I said , bring him here : What are you waiting for ? Look at me when I speak to you ! I have given you a direct order , and I wish to be obeyed ! Pick up Captain Rogers , and take him back to my chambers immediately : : : Or I will have you executed ! [ Ardala Gasps ] What are you doing ? - [ Tigerman Grunts ] - [ Ardala Grunts ] It seems he intends to kill you unless you let them go : After all , he does owe Buck Rogers his life : Why , you pigheaded monster ! [ Growls ] It would appear , Princess , it 's either you or them : What is your wish ? Let us go , Princess : There 'll be another time , another place , - won 't there ? - [ Ardala ] All right , Buck : No : Captain Rogers is correct : There will be another time : Tigerman ? I owed you a life : We are now : : : Even : What is he doing ? Well , thanks to Dr : Junius and the archives , he 's listening to a tape of Meat Loaf : Don 't ask : [ Dr : Theopolis ] Buck , you do realize , had it not been a question of hundreds of thousands of lives , we would never have betrayed you like we did : Now , look , I invited you all here to show you there are no hard feelings : The pyramid is gone : Ardala and Kane are gone : I 'm here , and I 'm single : [ Chuckles ] And I 'm gonna introduce you all to some good , old-fashioned split-pea soup : Well , it 's not really peas , it 's a soybean derivative , but it 's the same principle : Now , who 'd like the first taste ? [ Both Laughing ] No , I ... I don 't think that would work : - What do you think , Doctor ? - You know , Twiki does have tactile sensors of a sort : While his system is incapable of anything like digestion , it 's not beyond his abilities to : : : Taste : - [ Sighs ] - [ Chirping ] No way , Jose :

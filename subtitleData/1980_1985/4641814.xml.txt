A joke on the children . But there 's a better reason . You don 't really know much about Halloween . You thought no further than the strange custom ... of having your children wear masks and go out begging for candy . It was the start of the year in our old Celtic lands , and we 'd be waiting ... in our houses of wattles and clay . The barriers would be down , you see , between the real and the unreal . And the dead might be looking in ... to sit by our fires of turf . Halloween . The festival of Samhain . The last great one took place 3,000 years ago , and the hills ran red ... with the blood of animals and children . Sacrifices ? It was a part of our world , our craft . Witchcraft ? To us , it was a way of controlling our environment . It 's not so different now . It 's time again . In the end , we don 't deci these things , you know . The planets do . They 're in alignment , and it 's time again . The world 's going to change tonight , Doctor . I 'm glad you 'll be able to watch it . And ... Happy Halloween .

 CAPTAIN : Present ! Fire ! Besides , who would want to hurt me ? People who want to get at your dad . I 've been working for five years to eradicate terrorism in my country . I know how these people think . And Jaggerman thinks they 're gonna try and get at him through her , huh ? I will see Jaggerman watch his precious daughter die , the way he watched Francois die . ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) One less terrorist for you to hunt down , Inspector Jaggerman . ( SIGHS ) I 'm afraid I don 't take any pleasure in executions , Commandant . Well . Ready ! Present ! Fire ! A dozen innocent victims killed . Seems hardly a fair exchange , huh ? And if he hadn 't been in the military , the government would not have made this an exceptional case . Inspector , in the farm house the terrorists were using , we found this in the fireplace . JAGGERMAN : My daughter ! Get me the US Embassy . Quickly . Yes , sir . LOCKE : Inspector Phillipe Jaggerman , currently with Interpol on an antiterrorist mission . He wants his daughter to return home . Jaggerman hasn 't seen her for about five years . He was afraid that she 'd take off if she knew that he had us protecting her . And Jaggerman thinks they 're gonna try and get at him through her , huh ? LOCKE : Could be . Let 's hope not . Well , at least she 's not our responsibility . Not yet . ( AUDIENCE LAUGHING ) ( AUDIENCE EXCLAIMING ) ( ALL APPLAUDING ) ( EXHALES ) You approve ? ( SIGHS ) Take another bow . You earned it . They loved you . Thank you . ANTON : ( WHISPERS ) Out of the way ! They will miss their cue . What 's wrong with you people ? You forget where you are ? I 'm sorry , Anton . It was my fault . The audience loved her . What 's wrong with an extra bow ? Change for the finale , Anna . Look , I do not believe in your American paranoia , but I did agree to accept your protection . I also kept it secret from the rest of the troupe . But what I did not agree is that you ruin my reputation . What 's the big deal ? It was an extra bow . An extra bow ! If you people had a union , I 'd ask for a replacement . You don 't understand ! Mime is a highly disciplined art . One , just one extra bow , can throw out the natural flow and rhythm of the entire performance ! There 's no room for such indulgence ! ( MUMBLING ) ( IMITATING ANTON ) ( EXHALES ) The show ... Must go on . Uh-huh . The roar of the grease paint . The smell of the crowd . God , I love show business ! ( AUDIENCE LAUGHING ) Ah ! We better stay on our toes or we 're gonna lose our jobs . That 's a nice move . The Company took a video of Airwolf in action ? LOCKE : Yeah . That chopper was one of the four that were hijacked from a supply ship in the Pacific two years ago . We didn 't make a connection until the terrorists used one of these choppers to take out the French Prime Minister 's motorcade six weeks ago . SAINT JOHN : And was put up against a firing squad for his efforts . The intelligence community 's best estimate places him as part of a new terrorist group , experts recruited from various countries . All the members have no criminal record , so they 're hard to track down . Any clue as to who the leader of the group is ? None . SAINT JOHN : What do the choppers have to do with the girl ? LOCKE : Well , Jaggerman is convinced that they 'll use the chopper to kidnap his daughter . But we believe that she is only a small part of a much bigger plan . Does the girl know she 's in danger ? I don 't think so . Well , let 's just hope that Mike breaks the news to her gently . He has a way with women . I just have a way with women . A certain je ne sais quoi . A what ? A ... A way with words . She trusts me . Don 't worry . I 'll tell her . Tell me what ? ( CHUCKLES ) Jo , didn 't you have to go fix some props or something for tonight 's show ? Uh , yeah , sure . Why not ? Hi . Hi . I know what you were going to tell me . You do ? Mmm-hmm . You were going to confess that you don 't really work in the theater . I was ? I mean , I don 't ? Any professional can tell that . You 're both too down-to-earth . Not the artistic temperament , you understand ? Yeah . Tell me something , Mike , you and Jo , are you friends or ... Uh , we 're just down-to-earth friends . Good . So , do you know any good places to eat ? Do I ? Uh , yeah , I do . Yeah . Lots . Do we still kidnap the girl ? DRUKER : Oh , yes . I will see Jaggerman watch his precious daughter die the way he watched Francois die . Our informer says they 've arrived in the theater . We must proceed with caution . The Americans have probably surrounded her with protection . No matter . We will teach Jaggerman how to cry . Huh ? And then on to bigger things . DETECTIVE : They found her , Inspector . The Americans have assigned two agents . Good . Arrange with our consulate to expedite her return trip . I don 't want any slipups . She 's not coming back . What ? She insists on continuing the tour . ( SIGHS ) Book me on the next flight . Use a false name . You 're going alone ? Yes , alone . Contact US Intelligence . I do not care where the press sits ! Just do not give away the seats of paying customers . Comprenez-vous ? Understand ? Okay . Well , then , I 'll tell Anna and you tell Anton . Not good . Why not ? ( SIGHS ) She needs gentle persuasion , Jo . Ah ! ( CHUCKLES ) More of your " je ne sais quoi " approach ? Yeah , yeah . Mmm-hmm . Besides , I 'm going to give her this . A detector ? Yeah . Mmm-hmm . Good luck , Mikey . Thanks , Jo . Oh , Anton , could I speak with you for a moment ? Anna 's father is coming in from France this afternoon and he insists on taking her back with him . What about the show ? What does Anna say about this ? Well , Mike 's talking to her now . We 've gotta get her to a safe place . A safe place ? ( SCOFFS ) You Americans see assassins behind every tree ! Traitors in the shadows . You 're like frightened children ! Look , when I was in the French Resistance , we lived by our wits . If we could not judge a traitor from one of our own , we died . Well , that 's what we are trying to prevent . You 're trying to frighten the girl ! She 's safer here among her friends . ( SIGHS ) ANNA : Spies . No , I still can 't believe that you would be part of all that ! Anna , we are not spies . We 're here to protect you . That 's all . Look , I don 't care what your orders are . The way I live my life is my own affair . That 's fine . That 's fine . But the danger could be real . What is real ? My life here is real ! No , what 's real is that you 're Phillipe Jaggerman 's daughter . That 's what 's real . LeBlanc . Anna LeBlanc . I left his name when I left his house . He 's worried about you . Oh , he 's worried about me ? He sent a message via the consulate ordering me to return . No thought for my life , what I 'm doing here . No , he is a driven man without a heart . Besides , who would want to hurt me ? People who want to get at your dad . ( SIGHS ) Anna , please . No . No , I am not going to run back to Papa . And you can keep your trinket . And to think I was beginning to like you . I want the chopper armed and ready to go on five minutes ' notice . You are to sleep here . Understand ? And have Pierre ready with the other chopper . ( PHONE RINGING ) Hello ? Say , what ? Oh , hang on . It 's Paris . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) MAN ON PHONE : The package is en route to you . D 'accord . Jaggerman has taken the bait . ( COMPUTER SPEAKING ) COMPUTER : Access code accepted . For your eyes only . Interpol alert . Interpol alert . ( COMPUTER SPEAKING ) ( TYPING ) ( COMPUTER SPEAKING ) ( SIGHS ) Ah , that 's him ! No shooting . I want him alive . Mr. Jaggerman ? Shall we go ? No , no , no ! They did not see us ! We 'll lose him ! Now , don 't be a fool . He came to see his daughter . We know where she is . Very good . Try this one . All right . Attention , attention , everyone ! Finish what you 're doing , then take an early supper . I want a technical rehearsal starting at 6 : 00 . Anna , I think you 're looking tired . Take some rest . Aw , it 's all right , Anton . I just need some air . I think I 'll join you . No . No , thank you . I prefer to be alone . Well , I need some fresh air , too , so ... ( MIKE APPLAUDS ) All right ! Jean . Jean , what say you and I juggle our schedules and go out and grab a burger . There 's no need for sign language , if that 's what you 're doing . He reads lips . Oh , yeah . Yeah . Sorry , I forgot . So , what do you say ? Yeah ? Hello , ladies . Oh , thanks . Well , I don 't blame him . Why don 't we join Jo and Anna ? We could all do with some air . Very good . Come on . ANNA : Mmm ! It 's good to be outside . The night is dark and devilish , too . Jo ? Jo , move it ! JO : Anna , run ! You all right ? They were too clumsy to be professionals . Let 's get out of here . Crazy American drivers , huh ? So , they have two men on the inside . That 's all we need to know . There is obviously no time to waste . Well , we don 't know for sure if it was an attempt on her life . JAGGERMAN : No ? A mere coincidence , perhaps ? Spare me your American optimism . I have been working for five years to eradicate terrorism in my country . I know how these people think . My people are out there risking their necks to help keep your daughter safe . ( SIGHS ) Forgive me . I am a worried father . I agreed to come here in the heat of the moment . You didn 't tell me my father would be here . Anna . I am not going home . ( SIGHS ) Could I have a few minutes alone with my daughter ? Sure . Why don 't you use the office ? We 'll wait in the hangar . Anna ? Papa , why do you always have to spoil things ? Papa , listen to me . On stage every night , I make a statement . A statement for peace and understanding . In my own small way , I act out stories about caring people , people who love their fellow human beings , people concerned with this very fragile , precious world we live in . ( EXHALES ) I am no threat to anyone . Who would want to harm me ? The terrorists who want to get back at me . ( SIGHS ) You haven 't changed , have you ? You 're still driven by this dirty little war of yours . We have evidence . Your poster in their headquarters . And what about the truck in the alley ? That was no accident . Is that the way you want me to live ? Crouching in a corner , terrified by every sound ? Oh , I had enough of that when I lived at home . Whatever problems there are between us , I hold myself responsible . I love you . I don 't want to see you hurt . There is a special rehearsal tonight . In preparation for our last performance . Why don 't you come and watch us ? You know , you 've never seen me perform . Very well . And then , you will consider returning with me ? All Americans like guns . ( CHUCKLES ) You 've seen the movies . I must leave tonight , Jean , after the performance . My sister is ill . I won 't have time to tell your grandfather , but will you give this note to him ? Will you do that for me ? Yes , I know . We 'll do more of that when I come back . You can safeguard the magician 's box for me . ( TELEPHONE RINGING ) Hello ? What do you want ? Well , we expected to hear from you by now . Is the girl still there ? She has left with the Americans . There 's nobody here . You fool . Where are they ? You said that no one would be hurt . You almost killed the boy , along with Anna . I 'm finished spying for you . Then you can say goodbye to your sister . Make preparations . We strike tonight . So what do you think ? Was it an attempt on her life ? Well , if it was , they were amateurs . But it succeeded in one thing . Which was ? They blew our cover . ( DOOR OPENS ) We 'll be late for the rehearsal . Uh , you 're right . Hey , do you wanna leave this hog and join us ? ( MONITOR BEEPING ) ( TYPING ) Move those props offstage ! ( MUTTERING ) Places , everybody ! Oh , Anna ! It 's about time ! You 're half hour late . I should dock you a day 's pay . Oh , Anton , it 's only a rehearsal ! " Only a rehearsal ! " All right , all right , everybody . Let us start . Saint John ? Well , I 'm glad you could make it , Jason . You wanna watch the rehearsal ? I could take the outside watch . Nah , I 'm a song and dance man myself . Besides , maybe we can switch at intermission . Deal . Anna ? Please ? For me ? All right . Locke , are you in position yet ? Just getting here , Jo . Looks like a normal night in a back alley . Well , watch out for trucks burning rubber . Over . That 's Cornelius . He 's playing the introduction for Tourand . He 's our mime magician . Now , you should really see him , Papa . It 's you I 'm interested in , Anna . Well , I 'm on next . I should really go get ready . Where 's Jean ? He 's on . Oh , thank you . You know , I don 't know how he does it . He can 't hear his cue and he 's always on time . ( COCKS GUN ) ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Locke , find Jaggerman and Anna . Fast . ( SIRENS WAILING ) Come on ! In the car . Jo ? JO : Nothing . No sign of Anna and Jaggerman . I do not understand . I do not understand . SAINT JOHN : Mike ? ( SIGHS ) Air or ground ? Give me air support . I 'm going to stay on the ground on this one . You got it . Mike , Jo , we 'll be in contact as soon as we get the Lady in the air . It 's a long shot right now , though . We have no idea which way they were headed . Don 't worry . We got help . She 's wearing a homing device . Come on , let 's go . One move , Jaggerman , she dies . That is your only warning . You won 't get away with this . Ah , American cliches . Then we will all die , huh ? What do you want from us ? What do I want ? That 's a good one . Tell her , Abdul , huh ? Revenge . Your death for his brother 's . No , no , the other direction . You 're losing it ! Look , come on , Locke , can 't you give us something more to go on ? We 're homing in on the detector , Mike . Give us a break . There 's more than just one car down there . Okay , okay . Do your best . Can 't you go any faster ? ( TIRES SCREECHING ) What is this ? Oh , no . " Dear Anton , " by the time you get this note , I shall be on my way to Beirut . " Terrorists are holding my sister hostage . " I promised to help them if they let her go . " Forgive me . " I had no choice . " They are after Anna . " She is in danger . " Tourand . " He was a good man , Jean . We will always remember him . At least let my daughter go . She is of no use to you . Au contraire , Monsieur Terrorist Hunter . She is of great use to us . Once you have watched her die , you will . What ! What is it ? It was a homing device . Anything ? The readings just stopped . They 're gone completely . I 'll try and contact Mike . Damn ! Now what ? Why don 't we just go by the warehouse again ? Out ! This way . ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) A simple yet effective device . ( GRUNTS ) I 'd love to kill you right now , but it would ruin my plan . Don 't gag her . No one can hear her screams . Look , we 'll crisscross the streets ... Look , we don 't even know what we 're looking for . Sit tight , you guys . We 've got some kind of activity in one of the buildings in that area . You might say that the fate of you and your daughter is in your own hands , Mr. Jaggerman . When the pressure is released , the bomb will explode . You 're scum , Druker , just like your brother . My only regret is that I will not be here to witness your suffering ! But I have a vivid imagination . Abdul . You have only a few moments to catch up for lost time , Mr. Jaggerman . I suggest you take advantage of it . Oh ! And by the way , in case your body does not give out , the bomb is scheduled to explode in ... Oh , let 's keep it a surprise , huh ? The girl and the old man have been taken care of . Stand by and make preparations for our final glory tomorrow . Anna , I ... ANNA : Papa , please don 't . I 'm so sorry . If I could do anything now , give anything ... Listen to me , Papa , it 's not your fault . I regret I never saw you perform . If I could do it all again , perhaps I would do it differently . I 've got something . It 's all right . Anna , are you all right ? Please , help Papa . Bring the barrel . Stand there . ( GRUNTING ) Okay . Let 's get the hell out of here . Come on . What was that ? Airwolf ? Come in , Airwolf . We 're okay down here . We 've lost them , Mike . I know where they 're headed . We sit tight until tomorrow . Let 's go back to the lair for now . What are we up against ? This information just came in . " Peter Druker . " Wanted in over five countries for masterminding terrorist activities . His brother was executed by Jaggerman for similar activities . " Abdul Rastiman . " Recently escaped from an Italian prison . He 's a demolitions expert . MIKE : He probably rigged the bomb in the warehouse . The targets have been narrowed to the NATO Conference . Let 's go . The conference site is 10 miles north . Bandits at three o 'clock . Hijacked choppers . Let 's pick ' em up . ABDUL : It looks like company . What is that thing ? Give me turbos . I 'm getting tired of this . LOCKE : Let 's go get ' em . DRUKER : Speed up . That 's one ! They 're headed out over the water . Gentlemen , set the chopper down . We 'll show them our pearly whites . A toast to long life and happiness for all of us . And especially our good American friends . A votre sante . I wish we could have met under better circumstances . Better than no circumstances at all . Thank you , Mike . Thank you for everything . Sounds a little too much like au revoir to me . I 'm afraid it is . We have a lot of catching up to do . And on your terms , one day at a time . Does that mean you 're not coming back ? Oh , I wouldn 't say that . Besides , I know this little bistro on the Pont-de-Nuit . They serve incredible American hamburgers . I 'll be there . And he 'll be there as soon as we can give him some time off . ( INAUDIBLE ) ( INAUDIBLE )

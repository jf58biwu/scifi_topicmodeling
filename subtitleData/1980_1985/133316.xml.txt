 Your move : bishop to knight four . My move : knight to rook three . Poor baby , you 're startin to lose it , aren 't ya ? Your move : king to rook one . My move : rook to knight six . Checkmate . Checkmate . You cheating ' bitch . Childs , what 's he doin ' ? Circlin ' the camp . Who is he ? - Said Norge or something on the side . - That 's Norwegian . - George , are you okay ? - Yeah , yeah , I 'm okay . Yeah . What 's goin ' on down there ? Watch it ! Easy . Easy . Easy . Easy . Yes . First goddamn week of winter . Oh , come on . Four stitches . Barely grazed ya . What were they doing flying that low , - Shooting at a dog , at us ? - Hmm , stir-crazy , cabin fever , who knows ? U.S. Number 31 , calling McMurdo . Come in , over . U.S. Number 31 , calling McMurdo , urgent ! Come in , over . Great . - Come on , come on . - Nobody ! Nobody . Get ahold of somebody . Get ahold of anybody ! We gotta report this mess ! Look , I haven 't been able to reach shit in two weeks ! I doubt if anybody 's talked to anybody on this entire continent , and you want me to reach somebody ! Maybe we at war with Norway . I was wondering when El Capitan was gonna get a chance to use his popgun . - How long they been stationed there ? - It says here only eight weeks . - That 's not long enough for guys to go bonkers . - Bullshit , Bwana . Five minutes is enough to put a man over down here . - Damn straight . - I mean , look at Palmer . He been the way he is since the first day . - How many in their party ? - They started with ten . - There 'd be eight others left . - How do we know ? Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us . - Nothing we can do . - Oh , yes there is . I want to go up . - In this weather ? - Bennings ? - Winds are gonna let up a tad next couple of hours . - A tad ? Can 't condone it much myself , but it is a short haul . An hour there , an hour back . - Shit , Doc , I 'll give you the lift . No problem . - Forget it , Palmer . Thanks for thinkin about it though . Loaded with kerosene . I count 15 cans . - MacReady ! - Mac , get your gear on . - It may not clear up for a week , and we 're the closest to ' em . - It 's all right by me , Doc . - I 'm just letting you know we 're taking a chance . - Quit griping , MacReady . If we get caught in a white-out , you can scratch one doctor and one pilot . This is real thin . It 'll clear as soon as you get up . It 's up to you , Mac . If you don 't wanna fly , we don 't fly . - You really wanna save those crazy Swedes , huh ? - Norwegians . - Which way , Doc ? - Southwest . You have to read the map 'cause I 'm gonna be busy . Mac 's really taking it up , huh ? He knows what he 's doing . Nauls , will you turn that crap down ? I 'm trying to get some sleep . I was shot today . - Oui , Bwana . Will do . - * Very superstitious * * Writing 's on the wall * * Very superstitious * Anybody there ? Hey , Sweden ? They 're not Swedish , Mac , they 're Norwegian . Mac ! My God ! What the hell happened here ? Come on , Doc . Portable video unit . - Anything ? - It 's all in Norwegian . - What are ya doin ' , Doc ? - It could be important work . I wanna take it back with us . It 's gettin ' late . Let 's hurry it up . I 'll check out the last few rooms . Hey , Copper , come here ! Maybe they found a fossil , the remains of some animal buried in the ice , - And they chopped it out . - But where is it ? Look at this . What is that ? Is that a man in there or something ? Whatever it is , they burned it up in a hurry . Help me find a shovel , Doc . - We found this . - Jesus Christ ! Blair , I 'd like you to start an autopsy right away . - Did you reach anybody yet ? - Reach anybody ? We 're a thousand miles from nowhere , man , and it 's gonna get a hell of a lot worse before it gets any better ! Well , stick to it , Windows , stick to it . Nothin ' wrong with this Norwegian , physiologically anyway . - No drugs , no alcohol , nothin ' . - Hmm . Well , what we got here is what appears to be , anyway , a normal set of internal organs . Heart , lungs , kidneys , liver , intestines . Seem to be normal . ... one , door number two and door number three . I think that Dawn Screen here has got the most to trade in . I went to you first . You brought your friend , Anna . You 've been consulting Anna all through the show . - You may as well consult her one more time . - I know how this one ends . Clark , will you put this mutt with the others where it belongs ? Yeah , okay . Go ahead . Go ahead . What are you waiting for ? I don 't know what the hell 's in there . - It 's weird and pissed off , whatever it is . - Bennings , go get Childs . What is this ? What 's goin ' on ? - Hey , Palmer , what is this ? - I don 't know . Childs ! Mac wants the flamethrower ! - Mac wants the what ? - That 's what he said ! - Now , move ! - Damn it ! - Stand back . - Mac , what is it ? No ! No ! God ! - Don 't ! Don 't ! No ! - Get back ! Get back ! Get your ass over here ! Burn it ! Damn it , Childs , torch it ! Oh , my God . Oh ! Ohh ! Look . Son of a bitch . What we 're talking about here is an organism ... that imitates other life-forms , and it imitates them perfectly . When this thing attacked our dogs , it tried to digest ' em , absorb them . And in the process shape its own cells to imitate them . This , for instance . That 's not dog . It 's imitation . We got to it before it had time to finish . Finish what ? Finish imitating these dogs . Easy . Easy . Good . Easy . Easy . - Clark ? - Yeah ? Did you notice anything strange about the dog , anything at all ? Strange ? No . What was the dog doing in the rec room ? I don 't know . He was just wandering around camp all day . Are you sayin ' to me the dog wasn 't put in the kennel until last night ? - Right . - How long were you alone with that dog ? I don 't know , an hour , hour and a half maybe . What the hell you lookin at me like that for ? - I don 't know . - What ? I don 't know . It 's probably nothing ' . It 's nothin ' at all . How much more of this crap is there ? - Oh , nine hours I 'd say . - We can 't learn anything from this . Guess not . Where 'd they take these shots ? Seems like they were spending a lot of their time ... in a little place northeast of their camp about five or six miles . What 's that ? It looks like something buried under the ice . And look at that , they 're planting thermite charges . Whatever it was , it was bigger than the block of ice you found . Here . This is it , the place where they were spending most of their time . - Pretty nasty out . 35 knots . - Screw it . I 'm gonna go up anyway . Half a mile due east . Jesus ! How long you figure this has been in the ice ? Well , the backscatter effect 's been bringin ' things up ... from way down around here for a long time . I 'd say ... I 'd say the ice it 's buried in ... is 100,000 years old at least . - And those Norwegians blew it up . - Yeah . I don 't know . Thousands of years ago it crashes and this thing ... gets thrown out or crawls out and it ends up freezing in the ice . - I just cannot believe any of this voodoo bullshit . - Childs , happens all the time , man . They 're fallin out of the skies like flies . Government knows all about it . Right , Mac ? - Do you believe any of this voodoo bullshit , Blair ? - Childs ? Childs , Chariots Of The Gods , man . They practically own South America . I mean , they taught the Incas everything they know . So , come on now , MacReady . The Norwegians get ahold of this ... - And they dig it up out of the ice . - Yes , Garry , they dig it up , they cart it back , it gets thawed out , wakes up , probably not in the best of moods . - I don 't know ... - Which one of you disrespectful men ... been tossin ' his dirty drawers in the kitchen trash can , huh ? From now on , I want my kitchen clean , all right ? Germ free ! Now , how 's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice ? - And how can it look like a dog ? - I don 't know how . 'Cause it 's different than us , see . 'Cause it 's from outer space . What do you want from me ? Ask him . You buy any of this , Blair ? Mac , we 're movin ' those things out of the lab into the storeroom . Can you come get your stuff ? Be there in a minute , Doc . Through the door . Right over there . Right over there . Sorry , Mac . You have to move your stuff ... Doc says we gotta stash ' em in here and lock ' em up . - I have to talk to you . - I 'm tired of talking , Fuchs . I just want to get up to my shack and get drunk . - Mac , it 's important . - What is it ? - Outside . - It 's 40 below outside . In the Thiokol . Please , Mac . We ought to just burn these things . Can 't burn the find of the century . That 's gonna win somebody the Nobel Prize . You got the keys ? Get ' em from Garry . I want to get some stuff out of here . There 's something wrong with Blair . He 's locked in his room and won 't answer the door . - I took one of his notebooks from the lab . Listen . - Yeah ? " It could have imitated a million life-forms on a million planets . It could change into any one of them at any time . - Now it wants life-forms on Earth ... " - It 's gettin ' cold , - And I haven 't slept in two days . - Wait a minute , Mac . " It needs to be alone and in close proximity with the life-form to be absorbed . - The chameleon strikes in the dark . " - Is Blair cracking up ? Damn it , MacReady . " There 's still cellular activity in these burned remains . They 're not dead yet . " Let 's go , Bennings . I gotta get some sleep . Holy shit . Go get the doc . - I 'll get Garry . We 'll meet in Blair 's room . - All right . It 's Bennings ! Bennings was right there , Mac ! I swear it had ahold of him ! - Windows , get back ! Keep away from him ! - Don 't touch him ! Get back ! Stay back ! It isn 't Bennings ! - My God ! What was happening to him ? - If it had time to finish , it would have looked and sounded and acted just like Bennings ! - I don 't know what you 're saying . - That was one of those things , trying to imitate him , Garry . - Come on . - MacReady , I 've known Bennings for ten years . He 's my friend . We gotta burn the rest of them . All right , step back . You sure that 's all of ' em ? We cleaned out the storehouse , the lab . There is nothing left . Where 's Blair ? I can 't find Blair . Where 's everybody else ? Windows is in the radio room still trying to get through . Everyone else is in the rec room . You go on . I 'll be in in a minute . Blair ? Blair ? Don 't come in here ! I got a gun ! I got an ax ! Don 't , you son of a bitch ! Don 't come in here ! You understand me ? - He 's got a gun , Mac ! - Anybody interferes , I 'll kill ' im ! Jesus ! He smashed up some of the chopper pretty good . Childs , go see if he got to the tractor . Nobody gets in and out of here ! Nobody ! You guys think I 'm crazy ! Well , that 's fine ! Most of ya don 't know what 's going on around here ! But I 'm damn well sure some of you do ! Christ ! He got most of the chopper and the tractor , and he 's killed the rest of the dogs . Garry , wait a minute ! Wait a minute ! All right , Childs , go around to the map room door . - Talk to him . - Okay . Go on . Norris , get a table from the lab . Do you think that thing wanted to be an animal ? No dogs make it a thousand miles through the cold . No , you don 't understand ! That thing wanted to be us ! A cell gets out , it could imitate everything on the face of the earth ! - And nothing could stop it ! - Okay , Blair . Come on now , you don 't want to hurt anybody . I 'll kill you ! Good shot , MacReady . Excuse me . - All right , bring him up . Lift him up . - Yeah . Okay . Okay . - What about your shack , MacReady ? - I don 't want him in my shack . We 'll lock him in the toolshed . Why am I in here ? For your own protection , Blair ... and ours . How you doin ' , old boy ? I don 't know who to trust . I know what you mean , Blair . Trust is a tough thing to come by these days . Tell you what ? Why don 't you just trust in the Lord ? Watch Clark . What ? I said , " Watch Clark . " And watch him close , do you hear me ? Now the radio 's gone . - So are the choppers . - We 're completely cut off . All we can do now is hole up ' til spring and wait for the rescue team . No , we don 't wait . Somebody in this camp ain 't what he appears . Right now that may be one or two of us . By spring it could be all of us . So how do we know who 's human ? If I was an imitation ... a perfect imitation ... how would you know if it was really me ? Is there some kind of test , Doc ? Well , yeah ... possibly . - I 've been thinking about a blood serum test . - What 's that ? We could take a sample of each person 's blood . We could mix it with uncontaminated blood . I suppose if there 's a reaction , we 'd know who isn 't human . We 've got whole blood in storage . Here , start working on it . Keep an eye on Clark . He was close to that dog . Yeah . Yeah . Mac , we need Blair 's help . He 's the only one ... - Who knows what this organism is capable of . - He 's too far gone , Fuchs . But get the rest of his notebooks and start going through them . Garry ! Hey , you guys , come here ! What ? - Somebody got to the blood ! - What ? - Where 's Clark ? - Right here . Wait a minute , wait a minute . Was this broken into ? No , the lock is undamaged . - Somebody opened it , closed it , then locked it . - Great . Who 's got access to it ? I guess I 'm the only one . And I got the only key . Would that test have worked , Doc ? - Oh , I think so , yes . - Somebody else sure as hell thought so . Well , who else could have used that key ? Nobody ! I just give it to Copper whenever he needs it ! - Could anybody have gotten it from you , Doc ? - I don 't see how . As soon as I 'm finished , I return it right away . Great . - When was the last time you used it ? - A day or so ago . I suppose somebody could have lifted it off me ... Oh , come on ! That key ring is always hooked to your belt . Accusing everybody ... Stop it now ! It ain 't worth it ! - Copper 's the only one who 's got any business with it . - Wait a minute ! - You 've been in here on several occasions ! - Doc thought of the test . - That clears him ? Bullshit ! - Why would he take ... - Shut up , man ! - Windows ! - Windows ! Put that down . - No . - I 'll put this right through your head . You guys gonna listen to Garry , let him give the orders ? He could be one of those things ! Windows , wait a minute . Just take it easy . Put the gun down . Put it down . - Garry , you don 't want to hurt anybody . - Get back . On the floor . It 's on the floor . I don 't know about Copper , but I give you my word , I did not go near that blood . But I guess you 'll all feel a little easier ... if somebody else was in charge . Norris , I can 't see anybody objecting to you . I 'm sorry , fellas , but I-I-I 'm not up to it . - I 'll take it . - Like hell you will . It should be somebody a little more even-tempered , Childs . All right . I know I 'm human . And if you were all these things , then you 'd just attack me right now . So some of you are still human . This thing doesn 't want to show itself . It wants to hide inside an imitation . It 'll fight if it has to , but it 's vulnerable out in the open . If it takes us over , then it has no more enemies , nobody left to kill it . And then it 's won . There 's a storm hitting us in six hours . We 're gonna find out who 's who . All right , Doc , Garry and Clark move over there away from the others . Norris , you and Childs shoot ' em up with morphine . Tie ' em down and watch ' em . - Fuchs , you start workin ' on a new test . - I need Doc 's help . Yeah , you don 't want to drug me . Mac , I 'm not a prisoner ! Here , let me do it . You 're gonna break the needle in my arm . No , Doc . He 's doin ' a real fine job . I 'm gonna hide this tape when I 'm finished . If none of us make it , at least there 'll be some kind of record . Storm 's been hitting us hard now for 48 hours . We still have nothing to go on . One other thing . I think it rips through your clothes when it takes you over . Windows found some shredded long johns , but the name tag was missing . They could be anybody 's . Nobody ... Nobody trusts anybody now . And we 're all very tired . Nobody trusts anybody now . There 's nothing else I can do . Just wait . R.J. MacReady , helicopter pilot , U.S. Outpost Number 31 . You come up with anything yet ? One or two ideas . But , MacReady , I 've been thinking . If a small particle of this thing is enough to take over an entire organism , then everyone should prepare their own meals . I suggest we only eat out of cans . All right . Who 's that ? Anybody see Fuchs ? Somebody blew out a fuse in the lab . Lights were out for an hour . Any one of us could have gotten to him . All right , we gotta find him . Nauls , why don 't you come with me and we 'll look outside . Palmer , you and Windows check the inside . I ain 't goin ' with Windows . I ain 't goin ' with him . I 'll go with Childs . - Hey , fuck you , Palmer ! - I ain 't goin ' with you ! - Who says I want you goin ' with me ? - All right , cut the bullshit ! Windows , you come with us . Norris , you stay here . Any of them move , you fry ' em . You hear anything at all , you cut loose on the sirens . We all meet back here in 20 minutes , regardless ! And everybody watch whoever you 're with , real close . Hey , Blair ! Blair , have you seen Fuchs ? I don 't want to stay out here anymore . I want to come back inside . Funny things . I hear funny things out here . - Have you come across Fuchs ? - It ain 't Fuchs . It ain 't Fuchs . I 'm not gonna harm anybody , and there 's nothing wrong with me . And if there was , I 'm all better now . I 'd like to come back inside . You got my promise . We 'll see . Hey , wait a minute . Wait a minute , man . I want to come back inside . Don 't you understand ? I 'm all right . I 'm much better . I won 't harm anybody . You gotta let me come back inside . Hold it ! Is it Fuchs ? Yeah . Why would it burn him ? Flare . Maybe he tried to burn it . Maybe he burned himself ... before it could get to him . Great ! Now what are we gonna do ? You go inside . Tell the others we found Fuchs . We 'll be in as soon as we can . - Where are we goin ' ? - Up to my shack . - What the hell for ? - ' Cause when I left , I turned the lights off . How long have they been out there ? Forty , forty-five minutes . We better start closing off the outside doors . Hey ! All of you come here ! Open up ! Open up this door ! Open up ! Open up ! Close that door . Where 's MacReady ? - I cut him loose of the line up by his shack . - Cut him loose ? Yeah . We were up checkin ' around his place . I found this . Look . It was stashed in his own oil furnace . Wind must have dislodged it , but I don 't think he saw me find it . I made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back . I cut him loose . - MacReady ? - He 's one of them . - When did it get to him ? - I don 't know . It could have been anytime , anywhere . - If it did get to him . - Look , Childs , come on ! - When the lights went out ! - That would have been the perfect time . Right ! You said guys were missing . And , Windows , where were you ? Palmer , I told you to shut the fuck up ! Where were you when the lights when out ? That 's what it wants : to pit us against each other ! Guys ! It 's MacReady . Shh ! - Let 's open it . - Hell no ! - Do you think he 's changed into one of those things ? - He 's had plenty of time . - Nothing human could have made it back here without a guideline . - Let 's open it now ! - Why are you so damn anxious to let him in here ? - ' Cause it 's so close ! - May be our best chance to blow it away ! - No ! - Just let him freeze to death outside . - What if we 're wrong about him ? Why , then we 're wrong ! Supply window ! All right , all right . We got no choice now ! Damn it ! He 's got the keys ! What 's goin ' on ? The towline snapped . That 's bullshit , Childs . He knows damn well I cut it . You 're a dead man , MacReady ! Or a dead whatever the hell you are ! Anyone messes with me and the whole camp goes . Come on , Childs , burn me . Put those torches on the floor and back off . Back off . Way off . - You asshole . - You 'd have done the same thing . Don 't argue with him . Where 's the rest ? So help me , I mean it ! It 's cool , MacReady . It 's cool , man ! Come on ! Yeah , yeah , man . Just relax . Anybody touches me , and we go . He 's not breathin ' ! Go untie the doc . Get him in here . And bring the others . From now on , nobody gets out of my sight . Lay him there . So you sweethearts ... were about to have yourselves a little lynching party , huh ? I might just have to put an end to you on general principles , Nauls . Did it occur to the jury that anybody could have stuck some of my clothes up the furnace ? We ain 't buying ' that . Quit that bickering over there ! Windows , wheel that defibrillator over here ! Put some gel on those paddles ! You 're gonna have to sleep sometime , MacReady . I 'm a real light sleeper , Childs . If anyone tries to wake me ... Uh-uh . Clear ! - Clear ! - Clear . - We 're on fire , MacReady ! - Get back ! Just wait ! - We 're on fire ! - Just wait ! All right , go ! Windows ! Windows , get in here ! You gotta be fuckin ' kidding . - What do you got in mind , MacReady ? - A little test . Windows , you and Palmer tie everybody down real tight . - What for ? - For your health . Let 's rush him ! He 's not gonna blow us all up ! No , no , wait a minute . Wait a minute . Let 's do what Mac says . I mean , he wasted Norris pretty quick , didn 't he ? That 's close enough , Clark . - He ain 't tying ' me up . - Then I 'll have to kill you . Then kill me . I mean it . I guess you do . - This is bullshit , Mac ! - Finish it , Palmer . They 're dead , Mac ! - Windows ? - Yo ? You tie up Palmer over here . We 're gonna draw a little bit of everybody 's blood . 'Cause we 're gonna find out who 's the thing . Watching Norris in there gave me the idea that ... maybe every part of him was a whole . Every little piece was an individual animal ... with a built-in desire to protect its own life . You see , when a man bleeds , it 's just tissue . But blood from one of you things won 't obey when it 's attacked . It 'll try and survive ; crawl away from a hot needle , say . Now you . That 's good . All right , move back . Over there . I guess you 're okay . All right , put that on and watch them . Now I 'll show you what I already know . That 's a crock of shit . Let 's try the Doc and Clark . Now Clark . Then Clark was human , huh ? Which makes you a murderer , don 't it ? Palmer now . This is pure nonsense . It doesn 't prove a thing . I thought you 'd feel that way , Garry . You were the only one that could have got to that blood . We 'll do you last . Get away from me ! MacReady , burn it ! What is it ? Get him , get him ! Just shoot ! MacReady , shoot ! - Get it , Mac ! - Get it ! Windows ! Blast him ! Get me outta here ! Windows ! Damn ! Get me outta here ! MacReady ! - Get in here ! - Quick , come on ! Hurry up ! It 's coming back ! Burn it ! Burn it , for God 's sake ! - Burn it ! Burn it ! - Hurry up , MacReady ! Let 's do it . Get me outta here ! Cut me loose ! Cut me the hell ... Come on , get me outta here ! Come on , get me outta here ! Cut me loose , damn it ! I know you gentlemen have been through a lot , but when you find the time , I 'd rather not spend the rest of this winter ... tied to this fucking couch ! Childs ... we 're goin ' out to give Blair the test . If he tries to make it back and we 're not with him , burn him . Mac , the door is open . How 'd he get out ? The door was bolted from the outside . Blair ? Hey , Blair ! You down there ? We got something for ya ! Blair 's been busy out here all by himself . - What is it ? - Something he 's been making . It 's a ship of some kind . He stole the parts from the helicopter . Smart s.o.b. He put it together piece by piece . Where was he tryin ' to go ? Anyplace but here . Hey , you guys , come here . Come here . I think I saw Childs outside the main entrance of the camp . - What 's he doing outside ? - I don 't know . Got a flare ? He got back inside and blew the generator . In six hours , it 'll be 100 below in here . Well , that 's suicide ! Not for that thing . It wants to freeze now . It 's got no way outta here . It just wants to go to sleep until the rescue team finds it . What can we do ? What can we do ? Whether we make it or not , we can 't let that thing freeze again . Maybe we 'll just warm things up a little around here . We 're not gettin outta here alive ... but neither is that thing . Generator room . Generator 's gone . Any way we can fix it ? It 's gone , MacReady . All right . We gotta bring this whole place right down into the ice . Garry , plant yours in the old storage room . Nauls , down by the generator . Oh , God . How 's it comin ' in there ? I said , " How 's it ... " Yeah , fuck you too ! You the only one who made it ? Not the only one . Did you kill it ? Where were you , Childs ? Thought I saw Blair . I went out after him ... and got lost in the storm . Fires got the temperature up all over the camp . Won 't last long though . Neither will we . How will we make it ? Maybe we shouldn 't . If you 're worried about me ... If we 've got any surprises for each other , I don 't think we 're in much shape to do anything about it . Well ... what do we do ? Why don 't we just ... wait here for a little while , see what happens . Yeah .

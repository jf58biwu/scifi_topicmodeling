 How long has Jack been on the inside ? Long enough to be in deep trouble , if we can 't get him out . The money will do you no good . You will never live to see it . You will tell me now . You came here for the diamonds . Where are they ? Damn ! Direct hit . What 's our ETA , Mike ? About two minutes sooner than the last time you asked me . Humor me . We 'll be over San Barrios in 47 minutes . Well , that 's doesn 't leave us much time . I just hope we get Jack away from Butarra before the rebels take over . We 'll get him out , Saint John . We 'd better . Anything ? Nothing so far , General Butarra . Then you have not tried hard enough ! But the rebels are ... The rebels are traitors . They 're less than two kilometers from here , General . Your life is in danger . Now , you listen to me . I must have that information . Ah ! Jack . What have you done with the money ? Where is it ? Are you sure he said nothing ? You want that I should ask him again ? ( JACK SCREAMING ) LOCKE : The rebel troops are closing in . Butarra has arrived at the stadium . That must be where they 're holding Paley . We 'd better get in and out of here fast , before this banana patch comes under new management . What 's the situation , Locke ? LOCKE : I 'm reading bodies inside the west section of the stadium complex . Looks like most of them have already pulled out . Well , what 's the game plan ? Give us five minutes to get in , then keep the rebels pinned down until we can get Jack out . Meet you at the drop point . Will do . Good luck . How long has Jack been on the inside ? Long enough to be in deep trouble , if we don 't get him out . You guys go back a long way , huh ? A long way . The money will do you no good . You will never live to see it . I hope whoever you sent it to knows it took your life to make them a wealthy man . I trusted you . You made a fool of me ! Lousy diamonds made of glass . I should make you eat them , one by one . Look , General , we have no time to play games with this Paley . We must leave . Not yet ! Very nice . Very nice . Your daughter ? Your sister maybe ? Perhaps she is the one . Perhaps she can shed some light on the subject for us . You bastards . You leave her alone . Thank you . You have told me all I need to know . ( GROANING ) ( HELICOPTER WHIRRING ) The rebels have air support . From where ? Your treachery has caused me a great deal of inconvenience . We are running out of time . I 'm not waiting for one lousy gringo . We 're going in , Locke . Heads up , boys . I 'll hold their attention . Damn ! Direct hit . Avionics bay . Jason , are you all right ? I am , but I 'm not so sure about the lady . The blast shook loose all the weaponry control . I 'm gonna have to pull back . You have killed him . You fool . Leave that garbage . SAINT JOHN : Cover me . You got it . ( GUNSHOTS ) ( SIGHS ) Jack ! Oh , God , Jack . Locke , can you get that chopper ? Negative . All systems are still down . ( INAUDIBLE ) We 're coming to the pick up point . We were too late . Butarra can 't have gotten far . Not without that money . Yeah . He 's not the kind of guy that floats a loan too easily . I 've cross-checked every name connected with Butarra against the central banking system . And ? And nothing . At least he was there long enough to infiltrate the regime . He discovered Butarra skimmed three hundred million dollars of US Aid . Our tax dollars hard at work . Uh , Mike ? MIKE : Yeah ? Wanna give me a hand here ? Sure . Why not ? What 's up ? He 's still taking it pretty hard , isn 't he ? Yeah . He 's been trying to trace Butarra and the money day and night since we got back . Any chance Jack was holding out on the Company ? MIKE : No . Just what the hell is that supposed to mean ? Come on , Saint John . She 's only trying to eliminate the possibilities . Nobody said Jack did anything wrong . But that kind of money could make anybody think twice . Jack was not a thief . Butarra killed him before he could tell anybody . And before we start tearing him down , maybe we ought to do a little more legwork . Which is exactly what we 're going to do . That 's why we 're going back to San Barrios . Paley 's assignment was to get the money out of the country so Butarra couldn 't get his hands on it . It got to be long gone from there by now . Yeah . But maybe the clues to where it is , are still there . It 's all we 've got . You up to it ? No , you guys can handle that . I 'm gonna run up to coast and visit Jack 's family . I think I 'll go and do a little fishing with a friend of ours . Well , I wouldn 't mind coming along , Jason . It 'll give me a chance to brush up on my Spanish . Are you sure you 'll be okay , Dad ? I 'm a big boy , Renee . I 've been alone on the island before . I know . It 's just that ... Are you sure you 're ready to see these guys ? It could stir up a lot of pain . And happy memories too . As you get older , you realize life 's a mixture of both . Who am I trying to kid ? You 're the one holding me together . I just miss him . I miss him so much . I know . I know . I miss him so much . You never get used to the sense of loss . I still miss your mom . Bye , Dad . My bones are telling me we 're in for a nasty storm tonight . I 'll have the fire roaring when you get back . Are you kidding ? That 's my job . Yes , Mother . Haven 't we got anything on this Butarra ? He can 't have dropped off the face of the earth . We 'd be better off if he had . So , what are we gonna look for in San Barrios ? I don 't know . We 've got one factor on our side . Butarra 's no longer there . He left in a hurry . But you don 't really believe that Jack Paley could have ripped off the treasury for himself ? ( SIGHS ) That 's the 300 million dollar question , isn 't it ? I love this part of the world . Jack did too . Did he talk about it much ? All the time . This is great . You mind if I take the wheel ? Oh , sure . Just head for that point straight up there . Okay . Got it . Can I help you ? Yes , senor . We think you can . SAINT JOHN : Jack used to talk about you all the time too . Really ? What did he say ? Oh , how pretty you are . How smart you are . Big brother stuff . How he used to run a full security check on anybody that asked you out . Yeah , that 's Jack . Always looking out for you , whether you want him to or not . That 's what big brothers are for . How 's your father ? Oh , he 's amazing . When I heard the news , I came straight home , expecting him to be in little pieces . But he was strong . He was really strong . I don 't know how he does it . How about you ? I 'm okay . It 's never easy . Here , I 've got something for you . That 's Jack 's . He always did like butterflies . There 's something I need to know . The government men who called about ... About Jack 's death . ( SNIFFLING ) All they would say was that he had died in the line of duty , serving his country . Jack was on a classified mission , Renee . I need to know . Did he suffer ? No . No , not at all . ( EXHALING ) ( SPEAKS SPANISH ) They really hated this guy . Let 's get started . Wait a minute . Nobody leaves in that big a hurry . What are you saying , they 're fakes ? Believe me , a woman knows these things . One hundred percent glass . So where are the real ones ? A woman doesn 't know everything about diamonds . Boy , do I love the great outdoors . Uh , Renee , you do have cable , or satellite dish , or something , right ? Are you kidding ? We don 't even have a phone . Oh , boy . You 'll have to excuse Mike . His idea of roughing it is mixing his own martinis . Well , why make life any tougher than it already is ? You do have someone who does that , right ? Carry that , will ya ? ( INAUDIBLE ) Dad 's really been looking forward to meeting you guys . Dad ! I don 't understand . Do come in . Make yourselves at home . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) So , no one wants to talk ? It 's a shame . It would make the evening pass so much more quickly . An interesting conversation piece , no ? Who would like to begin ? Renee ? Very pretty . Innocent . ( THUNDER RUMBLES ) Perhaps genuinely so . Perhaps not . How about you , old man ? You chose a poor time to pay a visit . If we 'd known you were gonna be here , we would have made other arrangements . MIKE : Definitely . You see , I didn 't get a chance to pack a thing . How about you , Saint John ? Not a thing . ( EXCLAIMS IN PAIN ) Where did you get this ? I gave it to her . You . Against the wall . Company intelligence reported that they found Butarra 's chopper located abandoned by the Oregon coast . He went north . Maybe this means something . Washington State ? Think there 's a connection ? Let 's find out . JO : Here it comes . ( BEEPING ) Paley . Jack Paley 's father . How long before we reach Sand Piper Island ? Four hours , minimum , and that 's going at top speed . You will tell me now . You came here for the diamonds . Where are they ? What diamonds ? I don 't know what the hell you 're talking about , Butarra . Then I have no more use for you . ( GUN CLICKS ) ( LAUGHING ) I am impressed . Had I men of your mettle in my command , perhaps I would not have been forced into exile . You couldn 't command a street sweeping detail , Butarra . The bullets in this clip are hand-Ioads . Specially made for me . Hollow points . They hit any part of the body , and death is immediate . Very messy . Are your nerves as good as your friend 's ? Of course , such a death is too quick . The prey dies of shock , not pain . These rounds , on the other hand , contain simple , low-grain steel jackets . A man may take 12-15 rounds and still remain conscious . You 're a monster . Big talk from a little man . Your son , Jack , shared the same habit . You ... You murdered Jack ! Lay off him , Butarra . Then tell me where the diamonds are ! COAST GUARD ON RADIO : Attention Last Resort . Attention Last Resort . Leave her alone , Butarra . I know where your diamonds are . Where are they ? Tell me now or the girl dies . They 're not in here . They 're hidden outside . Tell me where . Let the others go , and I 'll take you to them . Hey , wait a minute ! You 're not going anywhere . Shut up . Jack was working with us . We came back to pick up the diamonds . You 're scum . You 're lying . Let 's go . I will go with him . No . No . Valdez , you go with him . What if he 's lying ? If you return empty handed , I will kill his friends one by one . With the exception of the girl . She will live a little longer . You 'll get your diamonds . Move . JO : Oh , it 's pretty bad . The whole west coast is locked into a major storm . It looks like our guys are right in the middle of it . Try raising the coast guard again . This weather is playing havoc with the communications . I 'll try a relay through New Orleans . Think about it , Valdez . You and I can take the diamonds and disappear . That 's 300 million dollars , split two ways . Think about it . I 've thought about it . In my plan , your name never came up . Keep moving . Where is it ? He said it was 10 paces due east from the base of this tree . One , two , three ... ( SCREAMING ) At least let my daughter go . Don 't waste your breath , old man . Don 't be foolish . So , what 's your cut out of this , Colenso ? The boss going to split with you 50-50 ? You talk too much . Valdez should have been back by now . I wouldn 't count on them coming back at all . Saint John 's too smart , and your friend Valdez is too dumb . They 're probably half-way to the mainland by now , divvying up the diamonds . God , I hate when this happens , you know . I 've got a feeling you guys have been suckered . Maybe he 's right . Valdez will be back . He cannot hide from me . He has seen first hand how I deal with those who betray me . Three hundred million bucks , Butarra . That 's a lot of cash . Come on . I mean , be serious . You think your friend , Valdez , hasn 't figured out by now that as soon as he brings the diamonds back , you 're going to kill him ? Yeah . Same thing goes for you , Colenso . I figure . If I was to take a wild guess , I 'd say that you 've cashed your last pay check . JO : Still no luck . Keep trying . Mayday . Mayday . Last Resort to Coast Guard . Come in Coast Guard . Come in , Coast Guard This is Last Resort . Do you read ? COAST GUARD : Last Resort . We 've been trying to reach you . We need help out here , fast . This is an emergency . Do you read ? This is the Coast Guard . We have a priority message from an Airwolf . I 'll patch you through . JO : Saint John ? Can you hear me ? Yes . Listen to me . Butarra is on the island . He 's got Mike and the Paleys held hostage . Can you get through to us ? How long , Jo ? JO : Even if we get through this , it 's going to take some time to get there . Just get here . Hold on , Saint John . We 'll make it . JO : I don 't like the look of this , Jason . The stress factors are reading at the top of the scale . The main rotor 's taken quite a beating . The rear quadrant 's about to go on a detour on its own . She 'll hang together . Even if we could get around this mess , it would take too much time . We 've got no choice . We 've just got to make it , that 's all . No matter how big a machine we build , we 're still at the mercy of Mother Nature . Right . But we can still give her a run for her money . Hey , Saint John tells me the fishing around here is great . There 's a couple of barracudas I 'd like to catch . There 's nowhere to run to now , is there , Butarra ? No country , no passport , no money . You 'll be lucky if you can find a used rat hole to hide in . But then I wouldn 't count on that . You 'd ruin the neighborhood . Let me take a piece out of this loudmouth pig . Figure it out , you guys . You 're all alone . BUTARRA : Nobody move . ( ADRIAN GROANING ) RENEE : Dad . MIKE : Stay still , everybody . Dad ? Are you okay ? Yeah . I 'm okay . Colenso , take a lamp . Go find Valdez . What 's the matter , Colenso ? Are you afraid of the dark ? I 'll be back for you , gringo . Go . Find him ! I 'll be waiting . ( SCREAMING ) ( LAMP SHATTERING ) Let 's hope we 're not too late . Don 't even think it . There 's a landing spot 20 degrees west of here . Locking in . At least the storm should cover our landing . That 's not all it 's doing . Looks like they 've had a power failure of some kind . We should be able to approach the lodge without being seen . It 's just on the other side of the trees . We can 't be sure of what 's gone down out there . Let 's be ready for anything . It 's just you and me now , Butarra . Just you and me . SAINT JOHN : And me ! Show yourselves or the girl dies . You 'll never get off the island , Butarra . I cut the boat adrift . You 're a dead man . And I will have you all for company . ( GUNSHOT ) Sorry we 're late . Better late than never . Now , that 's the real thing . And we owe it all to Jack . He was a brave man . Yeah . With all that 's happened around here , you guys are going to have a lot to deal with . We could miss one or two of these . ( LAUGHS ) Thanks , but I don 't think that would be right . Jack gave his life trying to do the right thing . I think we better get going soon . Where 's Saint John ? Uh , I think he 's going to stay around here for a while . There 's a good spot off Bowen Island . When Jack had something on his mind , we used to go up there and talk for hours . Sometimes , we 'd forget to fish . Yeah . Jack used to love to talk . About you , about Renee , about this place . He always planned on bringing me up here . I guess in a way he did . He loved it here . Jack was going to take over in a few years . He told me . So what are you going to do now ? Fish . Try to forget . Try to remember the good times . Did Jack ever tell you about the time we tricked a weekend pass out of our Sergeant Old Blood and Guts Goodwill ? No . He never did . It 's a long story . Good .

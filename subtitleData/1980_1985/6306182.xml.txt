 'Good evening , ladies and gentlemen , from the Channel 5 newsroom . 'Top of the news this evening is speculation concerning the real facts 'behind the Department of Health announcement about a radioactive spill 'supposed to have occurred yesterday at the state nuclear plant . 'Information from an official source , 'which reached our newsroom this afternoon , 'stresses the seriousness of the situation , 'but at the same time , provides a certain amount of reassurance ... ' Hi , Miller . Mr Desmond 's waiting for you . Go right in . ' ... expected at any moment , a Professor Otto Hagenbach ... ' - Ah , Miller . - ' ... one of the original planners , 'will undoubtedly enable us to obtain more precise information . ' You heard ? He 's arriving tomorrow morning at 11 . - Take one of the best cameramen . - Why me , in particular ? Because I want an exhaustive interview which will reassure our viewers . Not just the truth - pure and simple ? Forget the philosophy , Miller . Just do what you 're told . If possible , sir . Only if possible . He hasn 't arrived yet . Find out what runway they 're landing on . OK . 'Clipper 981 . Cell code OK . 'Request cell code on 5626.5 . ' Clipper 981 , this is Glipswick . Stand by . 'Glipswick , this is Clipper 981 . Will do . ' 'Glipswick tower , this is flight 777 out of Selkirk ... ' - Hey , Willy . Come over here . - ... Flight 777 , will do . Stand by . - What have you got ? - Unidentified trace . What 's the bearing ? About 30 miles northeast , altitude approximately 5,000 . Hm . ' ... request permission to land . ' Control tower here . There 's a trace approaching from the northeast . Distance about 30 miles . 'We 've seen it . Doesn 't seem to fit in with any of our data . 'We 're trying to identify it now . ' Try to make contact . Calling aircraft about 30 miles northeast of Glipswick tower . Identify yourself . Calling aircraft 30 miles northeast of Glipswick tower . Identify yourself , please . Could be his radio isn 't working . 'Glipswick tower , this is Twin Beachcraft , A101579 . 'Approaching from 100 miles due south . Request landing instructions . ' Glipswick tower to Beachcraft . Please stand by . It 's a Hercules military transport . That 's strange . It doesn 't have any markings on it . It looks like he 's going to land . He 's coming in on 16 . Make sure that runway 's clear . Pete , declare an emergency , please . Attention ground crew . Emergency landing runway 16 . Repeat , emergency landing runway 16 . Hey , you up there . Who are you ? Where 's the pilot ? Harry here . Nobody inside answers . - What the hell 's going on ? - I don 't know . What do you think ? Let 's see . - What 's the story ? - Nobody answers , sir . You inside , open the door and come outwith your hands in the air . This is Commander Davidson of the Airport Security Police . You are surrounded . In the name of the law , I order you to come out . You have just 30 seconds to make up your mind . Watch it . Door 's opening . It 's Professor Hagenbach . I don 't believe it . My God ! Let 's get out of here . Let 's go ! Interrupt the programme . We 're transmitting a special news flash . - Does the chief know about it ? - There 's no time to tell him . Am I in charge of the broadcast or not ? Whatever you says , master . Your wish is my command . Wake up , Terry . Drop your powderpuff , girl , and announce Miller . Special news flash . Ladies and gentlemen , your attention , please . We are interrupting our transmission of It 's All Music for a special news flash . At the end of the news flash , we will return with our regular programme . Thank you . Oh , shit ! Just when I was gonna do my first close-up . Oh , shut up , will you ? I want to listen to it ! At 11 o 'clock , an event without precedent took place at the airport of the city . An airplane with no nationality landed on the south runway , ignoring all instructions from the control tower . 'The airport police immediately converged on the scene of the ... ' ... surrounding the aircraft ... ' Yes , sir . I told him that . Right away , chief . 'The order had absolutely no effect . ' What the hell are you doing ? Why did you interrupt my broadcast ? Don 't get mad at me , it 's not my fault . The chief rang down . - Albert , what the hell 's going on here ? - They 're UFOs . - It 's bound to happen sooner or later . - You read too many comic books . Hey , you can say what you want , but I 'm not going home alone tonight . You can sleep at my house . I 'll protect you ! Yeah , yeah ... Who 's gonna protect me from him ? Will you all shut up ? We 're back on the air in 20 seconds . Come on . Is it possible that you 're not aware of the trouble that broadcast could have stirred up ? - Or the uproar that would have followed it ? - I 'm well aware of that , General Murchison . But I am a journalist and my job is to keep the public informed . Mr Miller , listen to me - very carefully . Something very serious has happened at the airport , but until we conclude our investigation and take the necessary countermeasures , nothing is going to leak out - nothing . The Defence Department has strictly forbidden it . I don 't give a damn about the Defence Department . In a democratic country nobody is allowed to interfere with the freedom of the press . For any reason whatsoever . I see . Mr Desmond , as the person in charge of this station , you will be held directly responsible for the dissemination of any tendentious news . I 'm sure you realise what you 're risking . Don 't worry . We won 't transmit anything without your authorisation . Thank you . Good morning . I 'm fed up with you , Miller . I 'm suspending you from all duties . No , you 're not . I quit . OK , I 'll take care of it first thing . Yeah . Excuse me , honey . Sorry . - Hello ? - Hello , Liz . Ls my wife there ? She ... She just went out this minute . - Call her back immediately . - Yes . Yes , sir . Of course . Mrs Miller ? Mrs Miller ! I am sorry , sir , but I missed her . But you 'll be able to reach her at the hospital in half an hour . She said she wasn 't feeling well today . She was going to stay home . I don 't know , maybe she changed her mind . OK , Liz . OK . Please don 't answer . It 'll stop . This is your day off . - Yes ? - ' Major Warren Holmes ? ' - Speaking . - ' This is Civil Defence headquarters . 'General Murchison would like you to come down here right away . ' - Why ? What 's up ? - ' The general will explain everything . 'Come right over . The drill is maximum urgency . ' I 'm sorry , my love . We 'll finish our conversation later . - What 's wrong ? Don 't you like it ? - No , on the contrary . But every time I look at it , I get a feeling of ... " Of death " , is that what you were going to say ? It 's funny , but it 's the first time that one of your works has given me a feeling like that . It 's the truth . I 'm sorry . I can 't say that you 're wrong . When I look at it objectively , I mean , when I 'm not actually working on it , I almost get the feeling that I wasn 't the one who made it , but some other being outside of me . - It frightens me . - That sounds like science fiction . Metaphysics , if you want . It 's better if we don 't take it too seriously . - I 'll drop it , if you like . - No . Don 't even think of it . Imagine what the world would have lost had Michelangelo destroyed his works - at the request of Major Warren Holmes ! - Yes , but I 'm not Michelangelo . To me , my love , you 're much more . Wake up , Major ! If not , you 're never going to get to work . Number one , zoom out to her waist and hold on her . Good . On two , hit it ! Holy shit ! What the hell 's going on down there ? Aagh ! Civil Defence ? This is Channel 5 TV station . We 're being attacked . For God 's sake , send somebody fast ! Get out of here . Aagh ! Aagh ! Hi , Louise . - Well , how are you feeling today , Phil ? - Horrible ! I feel like somebody who 's waiting for the hatchet guy to chop off his head . Well , now . That sounds like an improvement over yesterday . - Temperature ? - Normal , Doctor . Continue with antibiotics every eight hours . Well , if it isn 't my favourite patient ! Hi , Jim . How are you feeling today ? I feel a lot better , but I can 't play soccer yet . You 've got a couple more weeks and that 's it . Before you know it , you 'll be running up and down that field , making one goal after another , really . - Dr Kramer 's the best there is . - Ls that the truth ? The truth . Last night I had this nightmare . It was all about my leg . There was a big explosion . It was right here in the hospital . I got hit and my leg got cut off . Well , we don 't have to worry over that any longer . Jimmy , your leg 's going to be just fine - the truth . - Well , OK . - I 'll stop by and see you later . Our latest reports show the presence of attackers here , here and here . This enables us to determine a presumed line of march from the airport to the city limits , then quite definitely in a northeastern direction . We don 't know if this indicates a predetermined plan , but we must react as though it did , we have no other choice . Unfortunately , the reports coming in from our various information centres , the latest from the National Science Academy , are all rather sketchy . But they do suggest , even in a vague way , the type of countermeasure to adopt . You may proceed . This is the body of one of the attackers . It was picked up on the runway at the airport . The autopsy categorically excludes an extra-terrestrial being . His molecular structure clearly establishes him as a member of the human race - a paradox , when you consider what they 've been doing . Colonel , please . I am Colonel Donahue for the Institute of Atomic Research . The examination of the various tissue samples we have taken from the body reveal the presence of a high degree of radioactivity , far superior to the level normally tolerated by the human organism . In addition , we have found , more or less , recent hyper-tissue regeneration . Can you make that a little simpler , Colonel ? Some of your colleagues may not have the same theoretical or technical background . In other words , this individual and others like him , have been subjected to strong doses of atomic radiation which increased their physical capacities beyond the norm . - How far beyond ? - That 's difficult to say . But it is a fact that these cells , subjected to every treatment we know , have turned out to be almost indestructible . In short ... it 's a kind of a superman . - Much more than that . - What do you mean ? I mean that the abnormal strengthening of the cell 's vital qualities has increased their direct genetic capacity . In other words , Major , the victims of these creatures are contaminated , even if they only suffer minor injuries . Then they can reproduce themselves , Colonel , say , indefinitely ? That , more or less , Major , is correct . And you say , with our weapons , they cannot be destroyed ? - No , that their substance can 't . - Excuse me , Colonel . - Isn 't that the same thing ? - Not exactly . A machine may be indestructible , yet its functioning may still be blocked . How ? By interrupting the feeding process , for example . Atomic contamination destroys the efficiency of red blood cells in very short order . That is why new blood is always needed for these creatures . True , the human organism is greatly strengthened . However , the power still remains the brain . A lesion to the nerve centres can produce paralysis . The procedure stops the complex entirely . You mean that only bullets damaging the cranium can stop these ... these monsters ? This corpse is the proof . It 's the only lifeless body we have recovered . The cerebral apparatus has been destroyed . Thank you , Colonel . General Reedman , you 've heard everything . The order to every soldier and police officer is " aim for the brain " . We must be very specific about that . As for our combat plan , we 'll follow emergency Plan H and keep Plan B in reserve in case the situation gets out of hand . That 's all for the moment , gentlemen . Thank you . Warren , I have to talk to you . Excuse me , General . May I make a phone call ? - All right , but hurry it up . - Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . I 'm trying to reach him now , sir . Yes , sir . Hold on , please . - Hello ? - ' Sheila ? ' Oh , it 's you , Warren . I was in the bathroom , doing my hair . I , er ... want to look nice for you this evening . I 'm afraid this evening is out of the question . - ' Can you tell me why ? ' - No , I can 't explain it now . - ' I was looking forward to ... ' - My darling , listen . I want you to do exactly as I tell you . Understand ? Perfectly . I will do what you wish and not ask why . - A typical male chauvinist pig attitude . - ' This is serious . Don 't kid around . ' Make sure all doors and windows are locked . Nobody is to be let in ! Nobody , understand ? I 'll be home as soon as I can . And when I get there , you 're to make damn sure it 's me ! - ' Clear ? ' - Yes . Transparent . Have you become insanely jealous , all of a sudden ? Think whatever you want to think , but for God 's sake , Sheila , do what I tell you ! OK . City Polyclinic , may I help you ? Will you hold the line , please ? Dr Miller is wanted on the telephone . It 's for you , Dr Miller . It 's your husband . Tell him I 'm very busy . He can call again later . I 'm sorry , sir , but Dr Miller is about to go into the operating room . - Please would you call again later ? - I must speak with her now . - It 's urgent ... - ' I 'm sorry , sir , but I can 't disturb her now ' . I see . Thank you . Oh ! Jessica , what are you doing ? We 're supposed to be leaving for the weekend ! I know , I know ! Is the camper all packed ? Packed and filled up with gas . Now , who could that be ? Oh , well . - OK . I 'll get it . - No , leave it . Don 't answer it . It 's probably some bore . Or maybe your father , who always wants to know where we 're going and where we 're going to stop and if we have enough money . Oh , didn 't you know ? Generals are fussy ! And General Murchison is no exception . I really don 't know why I married Jessica Murchison . It isn 't even three months and already you repent ? I 'm a passivist . You know I hate uniforms . Good morning , madam . Your father wishes you to join him immediately , - at Defence headquarters . - He does ? - At headquarters ? Why ? - I have no idea . He tried to phone you , but there wasn 't any answer . He says that you 're not to waste any time . I have a car outside . - Why ? Did something serious happen ? - Your father will explain everything to you . Maybe some kind of war broke out ! OK . You can wait for us in the car . - ' Headquarters 79 . ' - Hello . May I talk to General Murchison ? - It 's his daughter speaking . - ' Yes , ma 'am . Hold the line . I 'll try to locate him . ' The line was cut off ! Listen . It 's dead . Why don 't we just clear out of here ? I don 't like spending my weekend with the general . It 's probably not important . I could call him from a telephone booth . Come on . Hurry up . We have to sneak out , so that idiot outside doesn 't realise anything . OK ? Let 's go ! Aagh ! Give me your hand . Dr Miller , please . I 'm her husband . Oh , I 'm so sorry . Dr Miller is in the operating room . She 's assisting Dr Kramer in a very delicate operation . We have strict orders not to disturb her . But I must see her ! I can 't wait ! Sorry , Mr Miller . Orders are orders . 'Dr Schreiber . Dr Schreiber , please . 'We have an emergency in the outpatient department . Dr Schreiber . ' What the devil 's going on today ? That 's the sixth emergency in two hours . All right , all right . I 'll be right down . Hold your socks on ! Raise it . Up ! It 's Whitey . Let him in . Come on . Come on , Whitey . Why are you standing there ? Aagh ! It happened before I ... Hm ? Hey , what 's happened here ? Get him out . Unfortunately , they 've just sabotaged the south power station as well . We have a team of engineers there , but it 'll take hours to get it working again . With luck ! - Well ? - The lines are still down . He has orders to bring your daughter and son-in-law back here to headquarters . - Thank you . - General Murchison . Gentlemen , the government insists that we not dramatise the situation or leak any news that might cause public disorder . We can 't conceal this from the public . Why , it 's absurd . The government disagrees . We 'll have to try to keep control of public buildings - barracks , hospitals - as long as we can . - After which ... - We 'll be completely on our own . You 're right , Warren . We 'll simply have to declare a state of emergency ourselves . - We need more help . - All right . Easy , easy . Take it easy . Whoa , whoa . Put her down there . Another one here ! Dr Peterson . They 're coming in like flies . Come on . We need all the help we can get . Hold that light up a little higher , nurse . Thank you . What the devil are they up to , those fools ? Why haven 't they turned on the emergency generators ? Two of the generators are out of order , Doctor . They 're starting the third . It 'll provide just enough current for us and the emergency ward . - Have you checked the pulse rate , Anna ? - Yes , Doctor . Weak but regular . Very well . Continue with direct oxygen . Keep that light steady . Ah ! It 's about time ! - Plasma 's running low , Doctor . - Huh ? Yes . Anna , would you please take care of that . And hurry . Yes , Doctor . - Yes , I do . I 'll be right back . - Quickly ! Help ! Help ! Somebody help us ! Oh , my God ! I can 't breathe . I think I 'm going to faint . - Why doesn 't somebody do something ? - Hey , out there ! Open up this door , will you ? Come on ! Help ! Somebody , help ! No . Stay away , please . Aagh . Oh , please , God ! Help me ! - Help ! Help ! - Anna ! Anna ! Where are you ? Aaagh ! It 's me . Don 't be afraid . - Oh , my God ! Dean ! - Take it easy . Take it easy . Oh , Dean . There 's something . It 's terrible . - You can 't imagine what I 've seen . - Yes , I know . Anna , come . Have they gone crazy ? Jason , do something . Make them keep quiet . Aaagh ! Aagh ! Keep still . Don 't move . No ! Aagh ! No ! Let 's try to reach the stairs . Now ! - Get us out of here ! - My heart feels like it 's bursting ! Why don 't they hear us ? Somebody help us ! - Please , somebody ! - Let 's not panic . If we keep calm , we can all breathe a lot easier . The shaft has a lot of air . Why doesn 't somebody do something ? These things have manual controls on them . - Why don 't they wind us down ? - You 're right . Hey ! Wind it down ! Hey ! Somebody wind us down ! - Get us out of here , will you ? - Help ! - Somebody help , please ! Help ! - Get us out of here . It 's all right . Be calm . We 're falling ! We 're falling ! We 're gonna be all right now . I can 't believe it ! The ambulance ! Behind you ! Look out ! Hey , George . How about taking us down a little ? Air Force 7 to Base 2 . Air Force 7 to Base 2 . We 're at coordinate B. So far , we 've had no trace of the invaders on this side . There 's only an ambulance heading out of town . I 'll continue on recon . - Continue as you are . - ' I 'm trying to . ' Any news of your family ? No , none . - I only hope they 're all right . - I 'm sorry , Murchison . Really I am . Thank you . Well , the situation is hopeless . Many parts of the country are cut off . Most telephone lines are out . What 's worse , we 've lost contact with government headquarters . We 'll have to declare a state of emergency ourselves . - But , you realise ... - I 'm fully aware of the consequences . - I just see no alternative . - I understand . What are your orders ? Please notify bases 112 and 401 to stand by with helicopters and , if necessary , squadrons of fighter bombers . We 've got to get control back at once , before it 's too late . Or before we all become contaminated , just like them . ' ... has declared a state of martial law . 'All civilians have been ordered to remain in their houses 'or to place themselves under the direct protection of the police or the military . 'Private traffic may circulate only if authorised by ... ' It 's frightening . How could a thing like this happen ? It 's part of the vital cycle of the human race - create and obliterate until we destroy ourselves . Words ! We 're up against a race of monsters . Created by other monsters who have only one thing on their mind - the discovery of greater power . At least this time there won 't be any historical justifications , if any of us survive . - Do you think it 's possible to stop them ? - The infection is like an oil stain . And who knows how far the contagion has spread now ? ' ... grave danger of contamination . 'Private enterprises will remain closed for an indefinite time . 'Weekend vacationers are ordered to report immediately 'to the nearest police station or military installation . 'The Civil Defence authorities have declared a state of emergency . 'They have further stated ... ' Jessica , stop that humming , will you ? It makes me nervous . Bob , what 's wrong ? What on earth is the matter ? I just heard a news flash on the radio . Something serious has happened in town . - They 've declared a state of emergency . - A state of emergency ? - Are they crazy ? - I ... I don 't know . It 's difficult to understand , but we should go back to town . But we just arrived ! I have no intention of giving up my weekend . To hell with the soldiers ! Listen , you 're my wife and I love you . I don 't want anything to happen to you , so it 's better we go away from here . - Something doesn 't feel right . - Like what ? Like that continuous barking without seeing a dog around . And we haven 't seen a car since we got here . In a place like this ? Look at the road , Jessica . Usually , there 's heavy traffic . - It 's all very strange . - Yes . It 's almost ten . They should arrive soon . Let 's talk with them . They should know what 's happened in town . OK . Bob ! My God ! It 's horrible ! What do you suppose happened ? There they are . Martha ! Martha ! Are we glad you 're here ! You can 't imagine what 's been going on . First , Bob heard this news flash ... Say , what 's going on ? You two ... ? Hey ! What are you doing with that gun ? Sheila ! Sheila , open the door ! Please , Sheila . Sheila ! It 's me , Cindy ! Let me in , please ! Sheila , can you hear me ? For God 's sake , Sheila , open the door ! Oh , Sheila , thank heavens I found you . I couldn 't stand it anymore , being in the house all alone . Come into the front room . Jeremy went off to work , and the cleaning woman never showed up . I kept hearing noises everywhere . - On the roof , in the cellar , everywhere ! - Well , you can relax now . We 're safe here , at least for the moment . - Warren is coming as soon as he can . - My God , Sheila ! What 's going on ? I don 't know . I really don 't know . Have you tried calling Gracie ? Her husband is with the department of ... something or other . How could I call ? The phone hasn 't been working for three hours . Are you sure ? Not working here , either . There must be a breakdown at the exchange . Cheer up . Drink this . I 'm frightened , Sheila . Really frightened . On the radio , they said to stay home and lock all the doors and windows . I did it . I even barricaded the coal hole to the cellar . - What did you say ? - I barricaded the coal hole to the cellar . How did I manage to forget that ? Wait , Sheila ! Don 't leave me alone ! I 'll come with you ! Thanks for reminding me ! Be quiet . Light a candle and stay down here . Sheila ? Sheila ? Sheila ! - They weren 't even curious . - We have a red cross protecting us . What is it , Dean ? Damn ! We 're running out of gas . There . Anybody here ? Anna ? You can get out , there 's nobody here . Looks like they left a little while ago . Ah ! - What do you think about this ? - It 's not really you . But it 's better than that . Just like a Western . Except that they didn 't have instant coffee in the " good old days " . Another advantage of civilisation , my dear . Like Coca-Cola or nuclear energy . We 'd be a whole lot healthier without all that stuff . Hm . This is good . Do you think we should give up the advantages that we have gained ? Maybe it would be better . However , it is not the fault of science and technology . But of man , nature 's own human element . We haven 't reached the age of the robot yet . This mess could have been avoided . - Yes , but for how long ? - I don 't know . But one thing is clear - we 're partly to blame ourselves . Just think of the lives that we have led , up until today . Shut up in those ridiculous cities , in a steel and concrete jungle , like machines . - This had to happen to realise the truth . - Let 's hope it isn 't too late . ' ... have special commando units positioned 'at all strategic points in and around the city , 'according to latest reports from the Civil Defence headquarters . 'Public buildings , offices and businesses alike have been ravaged , 'and damage is estimated in the hundreds of thousands . 'General Hospital has been hit the hardest . 'Many have been seriously injured and hundreds of lives have been lost , 'with the end still not in sight . 'General Murchison , commanding officer of Civil Defence headqu ... ' Anna , my love , it 's better we start moving . Get all the provisions you can from the back room . I 'll get the gas . Dean ! They 're here outside . I saw them , Dean . I saw them . It won 't hold them for long . Find something , something like cotton . - Here . - Perfect . Let 's hope this works . They 're all together . When I say " now " , you open the door . - But Dean , I can 't ... - Listen ! Do what I say . Don 't argue ! All right . NOW ! Let 's go . - Do you want some more ? - No . Don 't give in . We 'll find a way out . Hang on . I 'm tired , really tired . And I 'm frightened . We 'll never get away from these monsters . Oh , Dean , what are we going to do ? All right . Nothing 's going to happen , as long as we stay together . I promise you . What we 've got to do now is get away from here as fast as we can . Let go of me ! Why don 't we face it ? There 's no place for us to go . They 're all around us , butchering everyone . Sooner or later , we , too , will be killed . Dean , I don 't want us to die . I don 't want us to die , but there 's nothing we can do . - They 're all around us everywhere ... - Stop it ! Come here . Run . Head for the woods behind you . Go ! Get us down a bit closer . They 're all over the place . Air Force 7 to Base 2 . Air Force 7 to Base 2 . I 've located a whole group of them . They are spread out around a mile southeast of the Patterson-Hyde building . They are moving in a south-southeast direction . Request immediate air assistance . Over . Base 2 to AF 7 , message received . Will pass your request to General Murchison at once . Who 's that , Reedman ? Just listen to me , Reedman . I 'm not interested in your opinion . I know it 's a huge risk . I agree with that , but there is no alternative . Just carry out my orders . If necessary , you can go to Chambers yourself . Hang on , Anna . We 'll find some solution in the end . I 'm sure ! You know there 's no solution . All we can fight for is a little time - but how much ? Everything seems all right . It looks peaceful . Come on . Wait here . Wait ! There 's nobody here . - But I ... - I told you that nobody is here . Let 's go . Let 's go in . Maybe we 'll find some help . Remember the medieval legend ? If they 're really vampires , they can 't enter the house of God . Ah ! Thank the Lord , Father . We were really hoping ... So much for the theory of vampires . Captain . What 's going on around here ? I 've been on the radio for the last half hour . Why hasn 't someone responded ? We located other infected areas north of here along sector 29 . So get those planes in the air . Well ? Don 't just stand there . Answer me . Or are you looking for a court martial ? Don 't move , Major , or I 'll kill you . I 'm not going to die like the others . You can 't fool me , Major . You 're like all the rest - contaminated , bringing death and destruction . But no more ! I don 't intend to die . I want to live . Put that gun down ! Crazy ! You 're calling me crazy ? You 're calling me ... ? I am not crazy ! Air Force 7 to Base 2 . Air Force 7 to Base 2 . This is Major Holmes calling . Gaden Airport is out of action . It has been infiltrated and sabotaged . Standing by for further orders . Over . Just a minute , Major . I will pass you over to General Murchison . Here you are , sir . Warren , this is Murchison . Listen carefully . All communications with operational command units have been cut off . Can you hear me ? Variant B is out . Return to base . Do you hear me ? Your mission is useless now . 'Message received , General . Will do . Over and out . ' Oh , Donahue . I suppose you 're here to tell me that your experiment didn 't work out ? On the contrary . The gas has proven effective . Our planes can fire it with their missile launchers . We can begin at once , General . But , Donahue , we have no planes ! Not anymore . - And there 's no more Reedman . - Didn 't he leave for the air base ? He never got there . They brought him here 20 minutes ago . God help us all . Wait here . We 're taking on a passenger . Sheila ? Sheila ! Sheila , why did you leave the door open ? I told you to ... No ! No , Sheila . No ! No ! Sheila ! Anna . Listen . Forget all about that priest . OK . I 'll forget all about him . Look . Eugh ! Look at that ! Maybe it still works . Wait here . When I give you the signal , run to the Jeep - fast . Yeah . Run for it , Anna ! Run . Hurry , Dean . Hey ! Help ! Over here ! Over here ! Help ! Over here ! Let 's try to pull them out of there . Hurry up ! But , Major , is it worth it ? Maybe they 're already infected . Just do what I tell you . - Come on . You can do it . - I can 't ! A little higher . Come on . Come on ! - I 'm dizzy . I can 't hold on ! - Don 't look down , Anna ! You can do it . Come on ! Don 't let go , Anna ! - I can 't hold on ! - Yes , you can , Anna ! What is it , Dean ? What 's wrong ? Oh , nothing . I had a horrible dream . A nightmare ! Anna , how do you feel ? Are you all right ? Yes , fine . I just want to go to sleep . God , it 's late ! I have to get to the airport . I 've got an interview to do . That interview with the nuclear scientist , Professor Hagenbach . I 've read a couple of his books . Now I finally get to meet him . Professor Hagenbach - important man ! Are you listening to me ? He hasn 't arrived yet . - Go find out what runway he 's landing on . - OK . Hey , Willy . About that unidentified aircraft . He 's heading in . Please identify yourself . Maybe his radio isn 't working . Declare an emergency . He 's heading for runway 16 . Get everything off his path . All right , let 's move ! - What the hell is going on ? - I don 't know , but it looks interesting . Let 's see . - What 's the story ? - Nobody answers , sir . This is the police . You want to come outwith your hands in the air .

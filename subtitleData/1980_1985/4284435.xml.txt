 Those Russians really know how to put on a show , don 't they ? You mean the Russians got to the moon ? What happened to the Americans ? I intend to have Dr. Von Braun and his colleagues in my custody . Somehow I 'm gonna see that you make it to the Americans . They must be taken alive . Stay with them . BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! ( PLUMMETING ) ( BOTH GROANING ) Cape Kennedy , the first U.S. Moon shot . Oh , you blew it . ( OMNI BEEPING ) Red light . Maybe that was the wrong date or place or something . No way . Bogg , this place looks like a junkyard . Oh , hey , look . We must be kind of close , huh ? Aerospace museum ? That 's an aerospace museum ? Doesn 't look like much of a gas station either , huh ? Red light , huh ? Some birthday present . Huh ! Come on . " Anywhere you wanna go . " That 's what you said . Hello ? Is anybody here ? No , there 's nobody here . Gas just pumps itself . Hi . What can I do for you , pilgrims ? This is Cape Kennedy , isn 't it ? Canaveral . Cape Canaveral . You guys miss the ship or something ? Oh . No ... But we did hear about the museum . Pretty hard to go anywhere without people talking about Wally 's museum . Absolutely famous . You hungry ? You look hungry . I got moon dogs , rocket burgers , orbit colas . Right up here at the snack stand . Absolutely famous , hardly need to advertise . Well , the gas business , now that 's another story . Been kinda slow ever since the government moved out . Moved out ? What about the moon shot ? Hey ! Wasn 't that something ? Those Russians really know how to put on a show , don 't they ? Of course , you couldn 't understand a darned thing they were saying . You mean the Russians got to the moon ? Yeah , about two years ago . Now for just about 50 cents I 've got a picture , color of course , some genuine Russian stamps , and that isn 't all ... Wally ... Yes , sir . We were kind of interested in the American space program . Well , sure . I guess we 're all a little patriotic , but the Russian stuff , that 's the best part of the tour . What happened ? What happened to the Americans ? Kinda missed the boat , I 'm sorry to say . A little like your friend here . You know the real rocket minds were the German V2 scientists in World War II . We were supposed to get them over here . You mean like Wernher Von Braun ? Yeah . Oh , thanks . I was on my way to get this . Moon dog . Listen , it 's all in the museum , guys . Better than I can tell it . Yeah , well , we 're kind of in a hurry , Wally . Do you think you can just tell us what happened ? Where 'd they go ? Well , the way the story goes , they were all hiding out in the Austrian Alps and one of their own scientists handed them over to some Nazi general . And he handed them over to the Russians . That 's how they got to the moon . You wouldn 't happen to know the date , would you ? Not happen to , friend ? I have a picture of those guys the day the Russians got them . May 2nd , ' 45 . It 's a real big seller . It 's only $ 2.50 . Of course that 's in black and white . ( OMNI BEEPING ) Now if you want the frame , it 's only five bucks more . Are you gents interested in getting on the mailing list ? Now that is really the way to go . I do a mailing , oh , well , I 'd say , just a couple of times a year . Fellas ? Fellas ? ( BEEPING ) We 're right near Reutte , Austria . I set it for May 1 , just in case . Well , how are we going to find Von Braun ? Up here . No ! Turn around the other way . Keep moving . Whatever you do , do not stop ! You will attract their attention . OFFICER : Halt ! Von Braun and the scientists are here . My information is unquestionable . I tried . I 'm sorry . I cannot waste any more time . The scientists are here somewhere in this village . It will not go well for any of you if I do not find them . Got any extras ? You have no papers ? Not exactly . We were just ... Shh . There is very little time . The Russians are advancing from the east . The Americans approach from the south . And you think they will be kind ? ( KAMMLER SCOFFS ) I doubt it . I intend to have Dr. Von Braun and his colleagues in my custody . And believe me , it will help all of our causes . Herr General . Yeah ? ( EXCLAIMS ) So ... Enough ! KAMMLER : You 're all at liberty for the moment . JEFFREY : That was close . You are either brave men or complete fools . Where are your papers ? It 's a long story . And I hope a good one . Kammler is not finished yet . Yeah , well , Von Braun is in big trouble . We 're looking for him , too . Who are you working for ? We 're here with the ... You ! You are an American ? Well , are you ? Well ... You are . Come . We 're just ... Americans ! Thank heaven . You were sent here to reach Wernher Von Braun ? Do you know where he is ? If you only knew how long and hard we have looked for you . Now wait a minute . I 'm not sure you understand that ... Understand ? Of course I understand . Quickly , come with me . He 's right here in the village , Klaus , as we thought . The informant ? Yeah . Now , I want a full squad , but strict orders , Klaus . They must be taken alive . Alive ? But the orders ? Oh , yes , to liquidate them , to bury their knowledge of our rockets . But the Russians want that knowledge . A deal with them may keep us out of a prison camp in Siberia . And we know all about camps , don 't we , Klaus ? Now hurry . We can always kill them later if we have to . Come . Bogg , you don 't think he could be the traitor ? I don 't know . ( EXPLOSIONS ) ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) They 're all right . How are things here ? I 'm glad you 're here . Wernher 's still disheartened . You wait here . The Wehrmacht is caught between the Allies and the Russians . Fighting is fierce . Wernher , Kammler is desperate . We must get out of here . I know , I know . But haven 't I done everything I can , and still we cannot lose him . Maybe somebody else should try . We are saved . I have made contact with the Americans . Where are they ? Wait . You will not believe it . Could it be true ? Wait . Wait , Otto . OTTO : Wernher , you were right . We will see . No . All this time you were right . Wait , Otto ! You see ? A boy ? The Americans have sent a child to rescue us ? Willie , please . Let them speak . Are you Dr. Von Braun ? You see ? American ! I 'm sorry , but I think your friend 's made a little mistake . Mistake ? I have made no mistake . You said you were Americans . That 's not exactly what I said . As I suspected , Ernst . You have led Herr General Kammler directly to us all . You lied . You said you were here for Dr. Von Braun . I am here for all of you . Believe me , we 're not with Kammler . We 're not with anybody . We 're just ... We 're here to warn you . To warn us ? About what ? What more could you warn us about ? I have some sensitive information . Get them out of here . No , Wernher , don 't let them go . We must listen . Please ... Wernher , we are wasting precious time . Doctor , I need to speak with you alone , please . The only ... No ! It is not with me you need to speak . None of you ! I cannot make any more decisions . I am the one who made the mistakes . What ? Wernher , what are you talking about ? I am not your leader . I have tried and I have failed . Wernher , no ! You cannot give up now . But look what I 've gotten you all into . My plans , my ideas , my bungling ... Enough ! We cannot take a chance on Kammler 's finding us . We must surrender to the Russians . No . Here , Otto . Take this radio crystal . And broadcast on our special frequency . And tell the others whatever you wish . No ! Please , Dr. Von Braun , you 've got to listen . Just wait . Before you bring all the scientists together , you have to ... ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Von Braun ! Von Braun ! ( KNOCKING CONTINUES ) KAMMLER : It would be simpler and safer to surrender . It 's Kammler . But how did he find us ? We 're trying to make you listen . One of your people is a traitor . OTTO : No ! VON BRAUN : Impossible . KAMMLER : Give yourselves up and no one will be hurt . KAMMLER : Von Braun ! Ernst . ERNST : Yeah ! ( ALL CHATTERING IN GERMAN ) Leave it . There is no time ! Here . The crystal . Don 't forget the crystal ! ( BANGING ON DOOR ) Burn the rest . ( BANGING CONTINUES ) Stay with them . Go on . What are you waiting for ? You don 't give me orders . Move ! Tear gas . It 's the only one we have left . Use it well . Come on ! ( OFFICERS SHOUTING ) ( COUGHING ) ERNST : Go ! ( OFFICERS SHOUTING IN GERMAN ) Schnell , in here . Do it ! Down that way ! Head them off ! They 've escaped ! Where are they ? Quick , quick ! Move ! BOGG : Where are we going ? OTTO : Into the mountains . We have a camp . JEFFREY : How far are we ? OTTO : About five miles from the village . I 'm afraid we must face the fact that there is an informer among us . It does not even matter who it is ! If Kammler was able to find us in the village , he might know by now even where the campsites are . I don 't think so . He would have been here by now . Still , we must prepare to leave immediately . Wernher , please tell them we cannot stay here any longer . ERIKA : But , Otto , where should we go ? To meet the Russians . I 'm sure the Americans will be here soon . The guns get closer every day . Yes , from both directions . What about the traitor ? Are we to ignore Herr Bogg 's warnings even now ? ( ALL CLAMORING ) Stop it all of you ! Wernher , please , tell us . What are we to do ? No , Erika , I will not . Dr. Von Braun , the Americans are looking for you . I 'm sure of it . Herr Bogg , everyone looks for us . And everyone looks to me to deliver them to safety . I couldn 't even get myself out of Peenem√ºnde safely . I broke my arm when my car went off the road . Now the war is almost over . And I will have to let my friends decide for themselves . But Wernher ... ( ERIKA AND VON BRAUN CHATTERING ) We have come this far together . Please , this one last time , let me try to find the Americans . This is foolishness . We have no time for any more of your bicycle rides . No . I think we should let him go . Just for a few hours . Otto , it 's ... Bogg , let me go with him . No . Please . A man and a boy . No one would suspect us . That is fine with me . I will get warmer clothes for both of you . He will be safe with Ernst . Perhaps much safer than he would be here . Please . ( SIGHS ) All right . People are leaving the villages . End of a war , many will be homeless . Are you sure we 're going the right way ? Have we passed any of the German army ? Sure . Then we 're going the right way . Ernst . He 's my age . Yeah . And old men , too . When all else is lost , we always seem to find more to lose . Come . Mr. Bogg . Dr. Schumann . I have something to tell you . Yes ? Back in the village . The cellar . I couldn 't move . I was frozen . I should have thanked you sooner . Forget it . Well , I am most grateful . Maybe you 'd better save your thanks till you 're really safe . What is safe anymore ? We used to have respect . We used to have a life . Now what are we ? Just something to buy , sell , throw away . That 's not what people are for . Erika . I need your help . I doubt that . I am little good to anyone at this time . Try , please . Think back . This afternoon , did anyone leave the basement ? I know Ernst left . But anyone else ? I know of no traitors , Mr. Bogg . Erika , please . I wasn 't asking you to ... General Kammler has other means at his disposal . Yes , I 'm sure he does . That 's ... Do not ask me to raise your suspicions about anyone . ( EXPLOSIONS ) ( GUNS FIRING ) Quickly , off the road ! ( EXCLAIMS ) This way . Here . This trail leads south . Let us hide the bicycles . We 'll leave them here . We must be close . Ja , we are close . But to which side ? How do you know the Americans are south ? We have received reports . Americans south . Russians east . ( MUTTERING IN GERMAN ) Excuse me , Dr. Von Braun . Your people need you . They 've come to depend on you . And in just a little while they 're gonna need you more than ever . Yes . Yes . You 've encouraged that . I was wrong . Too late . You are a stranger . What do you know of us ? Enough . Tell me about Kurt . He is a young man who cares very much about saving us . Where did you find him ? In the village . Not at the rocket center ? Forget it . Bitte forget Kurt , ja ? Who then , Doctor ? Does it matter ? Yes , it matters . Somehow I 'm going to see that you make it to the Americans , but I can 't do that if one of your own people is sabotaging us every step of the way . Herr Bogg . Yes ? Our own people , as you put it . Even Kammler , General Kammler , is one of our own people . SOLDIER : Halt . ( SOLDIER SPEAKING GERMAN ) We 're civilians . We 've lost our way . You say nothing . Let me talk . SOLDIER : Hey , you guys sprechen Sie English ? Seen any Kraut soldiers ? Jeffrey Jones , New York , New York . I 've heard it all now . Fred Schneiker , Sheboygan , Wisconsin . All right ! ERNST : The Americans are sorry , but they cannot come for us . It was a small patrol and there are too many Nazis in the village . We must make it through on our own to meet them . We finally find the Americans and this is how we decide ? Where are the others ? They are packing up as fast as they can , Otto . That is their answer . They want the Americans . The wonderful Americans . You think they will take all of us , the families ? Move all of them to the United States ? With the Russians , even if we cannot go home , our families will be close . Ernst , what did they tell you ? Oh , they are most anxious to receive Germany 's scientists . They will do everything they can . How many ? Numbers were not discussed . You see ? OTTO : No . No , I don 't see . Now , right now , they fight Germany . But they are nothing alike . Look at the way they are , their life , their politics . Tell us about America , Otto . When were you there ? Well , it 's true I have not been there , but I have heard . They 'll put us in a camp . We 'll be no better off than we are now . No . That 's not true . It 's my country and it 's a wonderful place . He 's just a boy . It is his home . He does not know any better . I 've traveled . Boy , have I traveled . Look , it 's not the only place to live , but it stands for what you 're looking for . It means being able to do what you want , being able to go where you want . Go on . You 're doing fine . And if you want to build rockets , to go into space , well , nobody but nobody can beat us . Why do you think we 're winning this war ? ( ALL CHATTERING IN GERMAN ) Think I overdid it ? You got my vote , Senator . For the Americans , a show of hands . Good . Pay no attention , Klaus . They despise us . It 's as meaningless as their bands and flowers that welcomed us years ago . Do you think we will get the information in time ? Oh , yeah . Our friend does not dare cross us . Von Braun will come out of his hole soon now and we 'll have them . Look , if we are to surrender , we do it on our own terms . You have to find a radio somewhere . The other scientists who are waiting in the area must be alerted . You can plug this crystal into any radio transmitter . Then you will be able to reach our people . There is great risk , Herr Bogg . It 's all right . I 'm going along with you . She is right . A woman is less threatening to them . And Kurt knows the area . But you ... I want to go . Besides , I couldn 't let the kid have all the glory . Here is the radio crystal . Thank you . Tell them to meet us just north of the town before sundown . Then we will make our way to the south . To the Americans . But won 't Kammler be able to hear you ? No , we have our own frequency . One that cannot be overheard . Kammler must not know . If he had any idea that we have to move through the village in order to reach them , we 're finished . Don 't worry . I 'll get the message out . Kurt . Ready . I 'm ... I am sorry we cannot spare a truck for just the three of you . Why do you have to go ? Someone has to keep an eye on Kurt . You really think it 's him ? He 's not a scientist and he 's the only one that didn 't come with them from Germany . We can 't take a chance . You heard Otto . Kammler can 't find out . Bogg ! Be careful . Sure . Voyager 's honor . Looks like it 's about to rain again . Perhaps I should go find some cover . Wait here , I 'll be right back . I guess it 's hard to think about leaving your country and starting all over again , huh ? It is . Well , this may not make very much sense right now , but believe me , if you and the others can get to the Americans , everything 's going to be all right . You 'll have a decent life . As the Americans like to say , home sweet home . I know it won 't be like your home . Doesn 't matter . There 's nothing left of my city . And your family ? Dead . They 're all dead . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to bring up any unpleasant memories . It 's not your fault . I have had no pleasant ones for a long time . But you 're a very intelligent woman , still young , beautiful . Silly of me not to count my blessings . I 've found a radio . Hi there . ( CHUCKLES ) Say , I was wondering if you could help me out . Would you know the best way to break a Nazi 's finger ? Easy . You punch him in the nose ! Here , take them . I hope Bogg makes it to your room . He will . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) BOGG : It 's me . Oh , good . I finally lost him . The radio , it 's almost ready . I 'll alert the groups on the special band . Are we sure no one saw you come in here ? No . No one . Dr. Schumann calling all Peenem√ºnde groups . Dr. Schumann calling all Peenem√ºnde groups . Urgent message . Our village location has been discovered . KURT : Knife . We are now operating from an emergency location . We have made contact with the Americans . All groups must move immediately . Groups at Oberjoch und Bramberg , I repeat , all groups must move today for rendezvous with American army . Find any means of transportation and meet us just north of the village . We will join the Americans down the south road . File . This may be our only chance . It is essential that you move quickly and quietly . We 've been had , Kurt . What ? She 's telling the Germans . She 's the traitor . The rendezvous point will be approximately ... Kammler ? Yes , but you don 't understand . Wernher trusted you even more than the others . I can explain . How could anyone explain what you 've done ? You cannot possibly think I would do such a thing out of choice . I have learned to hate the Nazis . Their cause is despicable . Their war is despicable . KURT : Then why ? They forced me . No one 's forcing you . We 're alone here , Erika . Just you , me and Kurt . Would you have me sacrifice my family ? You said your family was dead . No . My brother , Edward . Kammler had him arrested in Hamburg . Now he is a prisoner here at the village . To force me . Don 't you see ? I am sorry . I am terribly ashamed . That 's not going to help us now . And if they had someone you loved , what would you do Kurt ? Here . Reach the scientists . Tell them to abandon their villages now . Give them the instructions . How will they get through ? Kammler will be waiting ! I don 't know . Well ... Something , anything , a diversion . With what ? How ? They have nothing . Von Braun and the scientists . They have to have some weapons . They are brilliant , but they are not soldiers . The truck in the camp . What was in it ? The one with the danger signs on it . It 's from the rocket center at Peenem√ºnde . With the explosives ? No . Mostly records , our research . And some of our prototypes . With warheads ? No . Chemicals . Chemicals ? What for ? For the fuel . We add chemicals to track the trajectory . Smoke . You can make smoke . Yes , but I don 't see how ... Get the groups moving . Dr. Von Braun doesn 't have a radio . I must speak to him as soon as he reaches one . This can work . It has to . Calling all Peenem√ºnde groups . Calling all Peenem√ºnde groups . Klaus ? Nothing , General . All their hideouts are like Oberjoch . Deserted . So the Schumann woman has obviously changed sides again . ( SCOFFS ) She will regret it when I allow her to watch her brother 's execution . What about the village ? As you ordered . No one is allowed on the street . They will never reach the south road . Order all units back here immediately . There is more news , Herr General . A last transmission . Hitler is dead . Berlin is finished . Well , this is our last chance . If I don 't get those scientists , nobody will . Kammler 's reinforcements are less than two hours away . Not much time left , Bogg . BOGG : I see Kammler 's headquarters . It used to be our mayor 's office . It will be again . Is that where they 're holding your brother ? I think so . All right . Let me use the radio . This is Bogg calling Dr. Von Braun . This is Bogg calling Dr. Von Braun . Over . This is Ernst , Herr Bogg . We read you . What has happened ? What shall we do ? I need Von Braun . Yes , of course . Yes , Bogg . You 've heard about Kammler ? That he discovered the other locations , yes . And now he 's waiting for you . His reinforcements are on the way . There is no Kammler between us and the Russians . What are we waiting for ? Calm it down , please , meine Herren . I can 't promise you anything , but there 's still a good chance you can get through . What are you talking about ? I have a plan . But we 'll have to work fast . And I 'll need your help , Doctor . We 're going to make the Nazis think the Americans are attacking the village . You won 't let go of me , will you ? You 're the man . You 've always been the man . Your people know it . You know it , too . Yes , I know it , too . What ? I can 't hear you . All right , tell me your plan . I am ready . We are all ready . ( ALL CHEERING ) Bogg , you okay ? You bet . I 'll see you in town , Senator . Better give me Von Braun back . You are not a bad leader yourself , Herr Bogg . ( SOLDIER ORDERING IN GERMAN ) KLAUS : The scientists will never get through the town . Good . ( STATIC BUZZING ) Careful , meine Herren , careful . Otto . Yeah ? Ready to fire at your command , Wernher . That way , everybody . Keep the rear of the launchers clear . VON BRAUN : Otto . Yeah ? Our young friend here deserves the honor . Yeah . Good . Pull that and that . Okay ? It 's the Americans . The Americans are attacking in force ! ( ALL CLAMORING ) Thousands of them ! I can see thousands of them ! Run ! ( SOLDIERS SHOUTING IN GERMAN ) Come back . Come back , you fools . Herr General , it is over . We must save ourselves . It 's the Americans . I can see tanks now . They 're almost here . Bogg , it 's working ! They 're running away . Bogg ? Bogg ? It 's Bogg . He 's out there . Bring the trucks now . Hurry ! Herr General , we cannot wait any longer . It is over . Go ! I sure hope you 're Edward Schumann . Are you with the Americans ? Are they really here ? Well , at least one of them . I 'm kind of honorary . ( HORNS HONKING ) ( ALL CHEERING ) Bogg , you did it ! You did it ! We did it . Just like always . We owe you so much , Phineas Bogg . And I ... I owe you a great personal debt . Thank you . Well , Jeffrey , auf Wiedersehen . See you . Now everyone on the trucks . ( ALL CHEERING ) We must not keep the Americans waiting . ( TRUCK ENGINE STARTING ) ( DINGS ) Bogg . Thank you . Bogg . The moon shot , then back to work . I know , I know . Perhaps later ? We can pretend we 're meeting for the first time . ( TRUCK HORN HONKS ) Go tend to Edward . I 'll catch up to you . Okay . You know , Bogg , I guess we could stay for a while . Make up some kinda story . No . That just makes it worse . Well , then , this time I 'm sorry , really sorry . Me , too . Here . Get us out of here . Cape Canaveral ? Should be Cape Kennedy by now . ANNOUNCER ... Astronauts report it feels good . T minus 25 seconds . 20 seconds and counting . T minus 15 seconds . Come on . Twelve , eleven , ten , nine . This is it ! This is the real thing ! Ignition sequence start . Five , four , three , two , one , zero . All engines running . ( ALL CHEERING ) Liftoff . Ready to go back to work ? What , are you kidding ? In three days ... ARMSTRONG ... I 'm gonna step off the LM now . That 's one small step for man , one giant leap for mankind . Bogg . No matter how long I live , you 'll never be able to top this present . Don 't sell me short . I get around , you know . We get around . Like I said . You know , Bogg , it 'd be really easy to see her now . See who ? Erika . I mean , the scientists made it . She 's probably around here somewhere . She 's too old for me now , anyway . Hey , you shouldn 't try to kid a kidder . Okay . I don 't know . I guess there 's a price to pay for everything , huh ? Even being a voyager . Bogg . Yeah ? When 's your birthday ? Come on . JEFFREY ... If you want to learn more about the history of rockets , Wernher Von Braun or the Apollo 11 moonwalk , take a voyage down to your public library . It 's all in books ! ( WOMAN SCREAMING ) Get out of there . But we didn 't do anything . Somebody 's been scaring folks around here and it could be anybody . You think there 's any chance the threats might stop the picture ? If anyone can get it made , it 's Wild Frank Roosevelt . Roosevelt ? Yeah , he 's the top director in town . We gotta get Roosevelt out of Hollywood , into the White House . Get out of here . Oh , no ! Please , somebody help me . BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! ( GAVEL BANGING ) ( PLUMMETING ) What happened ? I think Napoleon and Josephine needed a little time alone . ( DOOR OPENING ) Bogg . Oh , no ! Please , somebody help me . Stay here . Are you all right ? DIRECTOR : Cut ! Cut ! What in blazes do you think you 're doing ? Yeah . What 's the big idea ? Jones , what kind of security is this ? Sorry , sir . I don 't know how he got past the guards . I have no patience for fools who think they can stop talking pictures by sabotaging this film . Destiny 's Choice may be the first talkie , but it won 't be the last . Hey , this is the guy that 's been sending those crazy letters . I thought you were in trouble . MAN : Buddy , it 's you who 's in trouble . I got news for you , pal . It 's gonna take more than a few threats to put us out of work . Get him out of here . Yeah . Mister , you 're getting lost and on the double . Thanks for trying to save me , even though I didn 't need saving . It was real courageous . JONES : Yeah , real courageous . Come on . Hey , what 's all the excitement ? So I made a mistake ... This kid says he belongs to him . Bogg ! Let go of the kid . Wild Frank 's seeing red . This guy just broke onto the set and attacked the actors . Come on . Hey , I didn 't know they were actors . How 'd you sneak onto the lot ? We didn 't sneak on . Look at the way he 's dressed . He 's probably another one of those extras from John Gilbert 's new pirate picture . SAM : Yeah , well , you got no business on this set . JONES : Or on this studio . Now , Sam , let 's get them out of here before there 's any more trouble . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) Tell Miss Bliss that I 'd like to see her . BOGG : But I don 't have any other clothes . Really , you don 't understand . JEFFREY : Why won 't you listen ? All that belongs to me . This is studio property , mister . Come on . The boots , too . ( BEEPING ) 1928 , Hollywood . Red light . That , too . That 's mine . Okay , pal , just relax . But that belongs to me . Sorry , but all props are studio property . Look , you don 't understand ... Hey , hey , hey . You just feel lucky we 're not calling the cops . Now get your shoes on . But we didn 't do anything . Somebody 's been scaring folks around here and it could be anybody , even you . Okay , come on , come on , let 's go , let 's go . BOGG : Hey , you don 't have to be so rough . Hey , Sam , who you got there ? Where have you been ? The Terrible Tots just locked the director in a trunk . Again ? Those kids are gonna drive me crazy . Are these the two that Wild Frank 's been carrying on about ? Yeah . Tough guys got to cause trouble , huh ? No way . It was a mistake . I thought the girl was in trouble . Yeah , this guy just saved Veronica Bliss from her own acting . What 's that supposed to mean ? Well , ever since the first day 's rushes , the word 's been out . Veronica Bliss is finished . But she is a great actress . In case you haven 't noticed , Sam , she talks kind of funny . Veronica Bliss is a big talent . Yeah , with a squeaky little voice and a lisp . Now you please take these guys off my hands before Wild Frank has my hide . Bogg , the Omni . I know . Let 's get these guys out of here . Come on , fellows . Let 's go . Hold up a minute . Look , that wasn 't even studio property . Well , it is now . You gotta give it back to me . Why won 't you listen ? Veronica , what 's wrong ? Thought I 'd drop off my wardrobe and props . I just got fired . Who fired you ? Wild Frank . He 's got no right ... Sam , we both knew it had to happen eventually . I don 't gotta do anything except get you out of the ... Hey , Sam ! The kid . Okay , okay , that 's enough . I 've been trying to go easy on you . What 's going on ? I 'm gonna have both these troublemakers arrested . But he 's just a kid . Yeah , we think him and his pal over here are the ones behind those threatening letters the studio 's been getting . Yeah and we 're calling the cops . Are you gonna call cops to arrest friends of mine ? But Jones said he broke onto the set . Oh , Sammy , who are you gonna believe ? Yeah , I was just trying to find Miss Bliss . Yeah , we have a date . You 're going out with this lug and a kid ? Oh , come on , Sam . Well , with all the funny stuff going on around here , a girl can 't be too careful about the friends she chooses . Now , don 't be jealous . I still love you best of all . Brown Derby okay with you guys ? Bogg , the Omni . I still say we should call the cops . Better get them out of the studio and quick or there 'll be trouble . Shall we ? You got a date . Keep your chin up , Veronica . I 'll be seeing you soon . I know it 's not exactly the Brown Derby , but you 're not exactly in the movies , are you ? Not exactly . This chili is great . Thanks . Would you like some , Phineas ? Would he ? Bogg 's a big expert on chili . Oh , a connoisseur ? Well , I have developed a certain familiarity with the cuisine . It is good . You 're just saying that . No , I 'm not . This is better than the chili Sam Houston whipped up at the Alamo . Never seemed to put enough chili peppers in it . It 's been my professional experience that you gotta be very careful with peppers . Were you a cook ? No . Mostly a waitress who picked up a few recipes along the way . That 's how I earned my living before I started acting . Sorry this place is such a mess . Did you just move in ? I was just moving out of this cubbyhole . I think this is a real nice place . Yeah . Not as nice as the pink stucco Spanish hacienda I was gonna buy . Were you going to Mexico ? No , right on Sunset Boulevard . It has two bedrooms , a bath and a shower and , are you ready ? A swimming pool . JEFFREY : Sounds like a really nice place . Yeah , it is . I loved it from the first minute I laid eyes on it . I just knew one day I was gonna live there . But all that 's changed now that I lost my job . Well , I 'll bet you 'll have another one in no time . Not as an actress . Not with the way I talk . I 'm really gonna miss it . I 've never been this close to a movie star before . In this town , tomorrow you might be the movie star . I heard one of the Terrible Tots started growing a beard and they 're looking for some new kid to replace him . Don 't laugh . It can happen just that fast . Look at me . Today a star , tomorrow a waitress . How long have you been an actress ? I did two silents with Wild Frank . Then he asked me to be in Destiny 's Choice . I couldn 't say no to the first talking picture . Guess you should have said no , huh ? Everybody hoped the vocal coaches would help . I think it 's lousy he fired you . Wild Frank knew I wasn 't right for the part , but the studio bosses insisted on their newest silent star . So they made him use me . I know it broke his heart to replace me . After all , he 's the one who discovered me . How ? I was waiting tables in the studio commissary . Sam Winthrop , he 's the guard who threw you off the lot . I remember . Well , he dragged Wild Frank down to the commissary to see me and that 's how I got into the movies . Sam has a good eye for talent . But , unfortunately , not a good ear . Darn , why can 't I sound like Garbo ? Well , I don 't think there 's anything wrong with the way you sound . Honest , I don 't . You don 't have to worry about hurting my feelings . Well , I think it 's a lot more important what you say than what you sound like when you say it . In silents , an actress didn 't need a voice , just her eyes . Well , you do have talented eyes . Doesn 't count , not once Destiny 's Choice is a hit . If they ever manage to finish it . Why did everybody panic about us being on the set today ? The studio 's been receiving some threatening letters . But who 'd go through all that trouble just for a movie ? A lot of people have a lot to lose . All the writers who made up the title cards between the scenes and all the musicians who played mood music behind the camera so the performers could cry or laugh on cue and all actors like me . And they figure that if Destiny 's Choice has enough bad luck , they might just toss the whole idea . That 's right . Sounds dumb to me . Sometimes when you 're frustrated and angry and there 's no way to change the situation , then people get desperate and they do dumb things . You think there 's any chance the threats might stop the picture ? Well , getting this talkie made has been a real uphill battle , what with all the threats . But if anyone can get it made , it 's Wild Frank Roosevelt . Roosevelt ? Yeah , Wild Frank Roosevelt . He 's the top director in town . There was a president with that name . Yeah . That was his cousin Teddy . Wild Frank 's got the right stuff to be president , though . He might have stayed in politics if it wasn 't for his legs . ( COUGHING ) Too many peppers ? Can I have some water , please ? Oh , sure . You okay ? Bogg , Franklin Delano Roosevelt had polio . But in 1928 , he was governor of New York . We gotta get Roosevelt out of Hollywood , into the White House . All right . Well , we need to find out exactly when and where lightning struck so we can go back and make sure he never comes to Hollywood . But how are we gonna do that without the Omni ? I 'm gonna get it while you stay here and find out how FDR got off track . How are you gonna get past those guards ? They said they 'd call the cops . As Wild Frank would say , " We 've nothing to fear but fear itself . " Here you are . Thanks . Where 's Phineas ? He went outside to get some air . I knew it , too many peppers . ( CLATTERING ) ( MEOWING ) ( GUARD WHISTLING ) ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) Get out of here . Get out of here . MAN : We got him . We got him right here . You again ! It is you who 's been making those threats . It 's him all right . First he makes trouble at the set and now this . No . This is it , pal . Now we 're calling in the cops . ( SIRENS WAILING ) Poor Phineas , what a night you 've had . Rumor is you emptied the last of your savings to post my bail . Couldn 't just let you stay locked up in there . It wasn 't me that set those explosions . I know . You know ? The fire bomb , the letters , it 's been him all along . It hasn 't been easy holding it in . But he 's been so good to me . Sam ? I should have told somebody before it got this far . " Destiny 's Choice must never be released . " I swear I will do anything to stop this picture from being made . " I don 't wanna hurt anybody ... " Why didn 't you tell the police ? I couldn 't . Not after all he 's done for me . I wouldn 't even be in movies if it wasn 't for him . I owe Sam everything . Unless we do something , sooner or later , someone 's gonna get hurt . Until last night , it was just the letters . I found him writing these , took them and threatened to tell it was him trying to sabotage Destiny 's Choice . It didn 't stop him . No . I feel awful ' cause I know he 's doing all this for me . But you were in the movie . Why would he want to shut it down ? Sam knew , as sure as silents had made me , talkies would break me . He 's such a gentle soul . I never thought he 'd follow through on the threats . But yesterday when I told him Roosevelt had fired me , I saw a look in his eyes and for the first time , even I was afraid of him . You don 't think he will go after Roosevelt now ? Phineas , I just don 't know anymore . I only know at that moment he looked as if he could kill . Then we gotta make sure he doesn 't get the chance . When does Roosevelt get to the set ? About 6 : 30 . It 's after 6 : 00 now . I 'll wake Jeff . We gotta make sure we get to Roosevelt before Sam does . Hey , Sam , lot of excitement around here last night , huh ? Yeah . Listen , I gotta go check the back lot . You think you can hold the fort down till I get back ? Sure thing . VERONICA : You guys okay back there ? BOGG : Might say we got everything covered . JEFFREY : Real funny , Bogg . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) VERONICA : We 're coming up to the gate now . BOGG : Is Sam on duty ? No , I don 't see him . Good morning , Charlie . Can I drive on ? Well , Miss Bliss , we didn 't expect to see you again . I thought I 'd drop by the set and say goodbye to everybody . Sure , I understand . I wanna give a big goodbye hug to Sam . He around ? He 's on the back lot . But he should be back soon . I guess I 'll catch him on my way out . Okay . All clear . Sam wasn 't at the gate . We heard . That means we don 't have a second to waste . Still think you can sneak me onto the stage ? Sure . What about me ? You 're going to the prop department and see if you can find the Omni . But I don 't even know where to start looking . How am I going to find it alone ? Look , I 've never been in a jam like this before . My instincts tell me to stick close to Roosevelt . If we find the Omni and fix everything , nothing of this will ever happen . Yeah , but what if Sam gets to Roosevelt before we find the Omni ? ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) MAN : Hey , Veronica , we 're real sorry you got kicked off the picture . Thanks , guys . There 's Wild Frank , safe and sound . Maybe we were wrong . No . We can 't take that chance . Do you see Sam ? No . Somebody 's gonna recognize me from yesterday . Here . Get in line over there . No one ever pays any attention to an extra . BOY 1 : Yeah , we got you now . ( CHILDREN LAUGHING ) Nobody 's gonna tell us what to do . BOY 2 : We 're the cowboys and you are the Indian . What 's going on here ? Mind your own business . You guys must be the Terrible Tots . Want our autographs ? No , thanks . But how would you guys like to do me a big favor ? ALL : No ! Come on , you 'll really be helping me out . ( ALL CLAMORING ) How 'd you guys like to get into a lot of trouble ? ALL : Yeah ! Come on . Phineas , there are so many people . Look , that 's the girl that got my part . I bet she sounds like Garbo . BOGG : Maybe . But she doesn 't look like you . Phineas , I don 't think we could see Sam if he were here . He could be hiding in a corner or behind a flat ... Here . Phineas , what are you up to ? About 20 feet , I 'd say . Why are you going up there ? Nothing like a catwalk for a bird 's eye view . GIRL : I 'm gonna find it . BOY : You 're too dumb . I 'm the one who will get it first . MAN : Okay , everybody , remember . This is a talking motion picture . You can 't gab off-camera like ... Let 's go , we 're ready to work . ... ' cause these mikes pick up every word . So hold it down . BOY : I found it . I found it . Hey , is this it ? Yeah , that 's it . Thanks . Finders keepers . Hey , come back here . It 's mine . Give it back to me . Come back here . MAN : Come on , first team on the set . Actors , on your marks . ( MAN CHATTERING ) Action ! WOMAN : Oh , no ! Please , somebody help me . ( WOMAN SCREAMING ) ( WOMAN SCREAMING ) Look out ! Get out of there . Mr. Roosevelt , are you all right ? I think so . Bogg , are you hurt ? No . Nobody 's hurt . Thanks to this young man . What kind of madman could have done such a thing ? Sam Winthrop was up there . I saw him . Yeah , it was me you saw . Sam , you did this ? Yes , sir . And the fire ? But why , Sam ? He did it for me . I knew that talkies would ruin Miss Bliss . I couldn 't let it happen . I don 't understand . Sam was my first friend in Hollywood . I didn 't have a dime . He felt so sorry for me he bought me lunch day after day . And when every door had been slammed in my face and I needed a shoulder to cry on ... Well , that uniform 's still got tear stains on it . He just felt sorry for me . Losing my job , having nowhere to go ... I didn 't do it because I felt sorry for you . I did it because I love you . Sam , we 're friends , good friends . I know you could never love a man like me . You know , I 've always known that . It 's okay . I understand that . You deserve more , better . But as long as you worked for the studio , I 'd be able to see you every day . And every night after I get home from work , I 'd go to whatever theater is playing one of your movies . And even if you left the studio , I 'd still be able to see you up there on the screen . But , you see , they were trying to take you away from me , and even on the screen I couldn 't let that happen , could I ? Oh , Sam . We 'd all be better off if I 'd just stayed a waitress . Come on , we gotta try and explain all this to the big boss . Wait , Sam . I 'm gonna go in there with you . ( CHILDREN CLAMORING ) You can 't have it . My little darlings . You are in the mood for games , my Terrible Tots . Franz Lubin will show you games . JEFFREY : Give me that . Bogg ! Bogg ! Hey , you missed all the excitement . No , I didn 't . Hey ! You found the Omni . Yeah . With a little help from my friends . Great . Now all we gotta do is get to New York and make sure Roosevelt becomes president . What year ? Well , Veronica said there was a script called Old Ironsides produced in 1924 . 1924 ... It was by a new writer named Franklin Delano ... ( OMNI BEEPING ) BOGG : New York . 1924 . Red light . JEFFREY : Well , we 're right on target . Now we just gotta stop Roosevelt from writing that script . If he hasn 't written it already . Uh-oh . Kid , how would you get a script from New York to California ? I 'd mail it , probably . Yeah , that 's what I was afraid of . Oh , good morning . Good morning , Mrs. Roosevelt . I did so hope you were the handyman . The radiator upstairs near Mr. Roosevelt 's room isn 't working . That 's too bad . Darn . The nights have been real cool . But it 's a beautiful day out today . Well , Mr. Roosevelt ought to be out in the sun . Yes . Mr. Bishop at the hardware store said he 'd send someone over . Oh , good . Well , here you are . Thank you . Now I want you to be very careful . Mr. Roosevelt is quite anxious about this script being delivered . MAILMAN : So he finally finished it . I want you to please be very careful with that . We 're too late . I promise you this script 's gonna get to Hollywood . Mr. Roosevelt said he 'd introduce me to Mary Pickford . Oh ! We 'll see . Bye . Bye . Come on . Hiya ! Hey , what 's the big idea ? Well , that envelope that Mrs. Roosevelt gave you ... Yeah , we 'll take it to down to the post office for you . It 's my job to deliver it . Thanks just the same . We 're heading into town anyway ... Get your hands off there . Don 't you know interfering with the US Mail is a federal offense ? Who 's interfering ? What 's the matter with you guys ? I could have you arrested for that . Bogg , if that script gets to Hollywood ... I know , I know . Wild Frank Roosevelt rides again . You tail the mailman and make sure that script doesn 't make it to the post office . What are you gonna do ? I 'm gonna convince Roosevelt that politics and not movies are his cup of tea . How do you think you 're gonna get inside ? I 'm gonna fix his radiator . Go on . Yes ? Good morning . Name 's Phineas Bogg . Mr. Bishop sent me . You got a radiator on the blink ? We certainly do . Come in , please . Mama , this is Mr. Bogg . He 's come to fix the radiator near Franklin 's room . Oh , splendid . My son needs to be kept warm at all times . It 's a beautiful warm day . Perhaps we could take Franklin outside for lunch . I won 't hear of it . A breeze might blow up . It 's as still as can be . He can catch a chill . Yes , Mama . This way , Mr. Bogg . Eleanor , may I see the letters ? Oh , they 're for Franklin . Why bother him with it ? I can handle it . These letters are addressed to Franklin and they will be delivered to Franklin . Eleanor . Did the script get off ? Oh , yes , Franklin . I 'm sorry . I didn 't realize we had a visitor . Franklin , this is Mr. Bogg . Good day , Mr. Bogg . He 's come to fix the radiator . Oh ! I should have realized he would need some utilitarian purpose to get past Mama . I am beginning to feel like the prisoner of Zenda . Franklin , this is your home . If you feel like a prisoner , I suggest you complain to your jailer and not to me . Yes . Dear Mama . Is that the mail ? The radiator is in the hall . This one 's from Louis Howe . I do so miss him and all of our other friends . Eleanor , he says Al Smith wants me to nominate him for president at the convention . ELEANOR : That 's wonderful . I guess this means I 'm still a member of the human race . Oh , Franklin , the world hasn 't forgotten you . Should I say yes to old Al ? Well , yes . I think it 's a perfect chance to get back into politics . This is almost too good to be true . What is the excitement about ? Franklin 's just had the most wonderful news . Mama , Al Smith wants me to nominate him at the convention . Isn 't that grand ? You 'll send your regrets , of course . Why , no . Eleanor thinks it 's a splendid idea . Yes , I do . MAMA : Al Smith hasn 't seen Franklin like this . He knows about my legs . Mama , he 's going to give a speech , not do a dance . That 's very good , Eleanor . I don 't know much about politics and I don 't care to . But how great an advantage will it be for Mr. Smith to be nominated by a man in a wheelchair ? Stop torturing yourself , Franklin , and face the truth . Your days in politics are behind you now . Franklin , you must go to the convention . No , Mama is right . I 'm no good to Al Smith like this . Politics can 't be conducted from a wheelchair . Your mother is wrong . And you are wrong . Eleanor , we both must start to accept the limitations of my illness . The only limitations I see are the ones you are putting on yourself . Eleanor , please . I 'll bring your lunch up later , Franklin . All finished , Mr. Roosevelt . FRANKLIN : That 's just fine . Yeah , that radiator ought to keep you real nice and toasty now . Thank you very much , Mr. Bogg . Least I can do . Must be tough enough to get through a day , you being an invalid and all . I don 't really think of myself as an invalid , Mr. Bogg . Oh , I 'm sorry . I thought you just sat up here in your bed all day . I do . But sometimes I sit in my wheelchair . Well , at least you 're lucky enough to have Mrs. Roosevelt and your mother to do everything for you , huh ? Mama and Eleanor do quite a lot , but they hardly do everything . I am a writer . I 've just completed a motion picture play script . No need to apologize to me . I understand . I think it 's a real pity , you 're so ... I don 't need your pity , sir . I don 't need anyone 's pity . No offense . Have a nice day . Mr. Bogg . Before you go , would you mind terribly helping me into my wheelchair ? There you are . Mr. Bogg , I need help getting into the chair . The polio paralyze your arms , too , huh ? ( HUMMING ) Excuse me . Can I help you with something , young man ? Yes , I just came from the Roosevelt house . I think Mrs. Roosevelt forgot to put postage on that envelope she gave you . MAILMAN : Ten cents postage . You tell Mrs. Roosevelt this envelope 's as good as in Hollywood right now . All right ? Small victory , eh , Mr. Bogg ? I don 't know . Seems like a pretty big victory to me . It 's been a long time since anyone challenged my disability . Thank you . Mr. Bogg . You 're not really here to fix the furnace , are you ? No , sir , I 'm not . Did Eleanor put you up to this ? No . She ... Al Smith . Al Smith and Louis Howe . God bless them . Mama was right . I best stick to my writing . I can 't do Al Smith any good making a nominating speech from a wheelchair . How about these ? I 've never used them . Well , you 're gonna learn . So the delegates and the whole world can see you nominate Al Smith on your feet . Yes , Mr. Howe , he did receive your letter and must regretfully decline your invitation to attend the convention . Whether or not he endorses Mr. Smith 's candidacy is beside the point . Physically , he simply cannot withstand the rigors of what you propose . Yes , yes , I will tell him you called . Goodbye , Mr. Howe . Why did you do that ? Eleanor , I thought we 'd settled this . Franklin is in full accord with my feelings . Then you should let him tell Mr. Howe . Franklin hasn 't got the strength for such things . In his weakened condition ... Franklin is not weak . As much as it wrenches my heart to say it , Franklin is a helpless invalid . The polio has only paralyzed his legs . You are destroying his spirit . Eleanor , I am his mother . I can only try to protect him . From what ? What does it matter if he stumbles , if he falls down at every turn ? How could he be any worse off than he already is , trapped up there in that room ? I cannot bear to see him stared at and ridiculed . If he has the courage to take that risk , then so must we . Mama , you tell him to make that speech . I cannot urge him onto an escapade that can only cause him pain . And I cannot stay here and watch you cheat him out of the life he is entitled to . The life he is destined to have . You 're a harsh taskmaster , Mr. Bogg . I 'll see if I can scare us up some lunch . You get back to work . Mrs. Roosevelt , excuse me , your husband wanted to know if lunch was ready yet . I 'm afraid you will have to check with Franklin 's mother . She is in charge of this household now . Wait , wait , wait . You can 't leave . Mr. Bogg , the only thing in this home that should concern you is that radiator . Mrs. Roosevelt , I wasn 't sent to fix your radiator . I came to try and help your husband . Well , he 'll need you now because I can 't help him . He won 't let me . But you know how much he needs you . He might be better off without me . What do you mean by that ? Well , sometimes I push Franklin to do more . Mama thinks too much . Seems to me that Mama protects him too much . Well , I can 't say that I 'd behave any differently with my own children . She loves him dearly . And what about you ? I love him . His vigor , his appetite for life . And that is why I cannot watch him use his illness as an excuse to waste his life . Well , there is one thing that the polio did take from Mr. Roosevelt . He can 't walk away from his problems . BOGG : How far did you say the podium would be from where you 'll be sitting ? Twenty feet or more . I 'd say it 's about from here halfway across the lawn . Think you can make it ? Surely . Seeing is believing . Franklin , you mustn 't . Mrs. Roosevelt , with all due respect , if you say one more word , I 'm gonna lock you in the butler 's pantry . Bogg , we stopped the script . Come to me , Franklin . You can do it , darling . Yes , yes . Just a little farther . Franklin , I love you . Hollywood , 1929 . Green light . FDR 's on his way to the White House and we 're on our way to our next assignment . Hey , look . What does boffo mean ? I think it means that the first talkie got made and it 's a big success . " It 's Al Jolson 's voice and singing talent " that show that talking pictures are here to stay . " Green light . Yeah . Sorry . It 's all my fault . I 'm late for the set . Veronica ? Yeah , I 'm Veronica Bliss . Have we met ? Well , sure . Remember ... No . We 're just a couple of fans . Fans ? Yeah . You 're our favorite actress . I am not an actress . I 'm a caterer . Caterer ? Yeah . I cook for all the movie crews . You must be working on that new pirate movie . Yeah . Here you are . Oh , thanks . You guys had lunch ? No . Here . You keep that . It 's chili con queso . My specialty . Nice meeting you . Again . That was another time zone , kid . Everything 's changed . FDR 's on his way back to the White House . Destiny 's Choice never got made and The Jazz Singer is a big hit . And Veronica found her niche , too . Nothing stays the same , everything changes . I know one thing that hasn 't changed . What ? This chili . It 's still great . Sam Houston , eat your heart out . JEFFREY ... If you wanna learn more about early Hollywood or President Franklin Delano Roosevelt , take a voyage down to your public library . It 's all in books ! ( ANNOUNCER CHATTERING ) That 's Joe Louis , heavyweight champ . ( MEN CHATTERING ) Schmeling beat you two years ago and now he wants to beat you again . JOE ... If I go down again to that man , everybody loses . Don 't get cute or we 'll all land very early a piece at a time . ( WOMAN EXCLAIMING ) Hello ? I need help . Hello , can you hear me ? MAN ... ( ON RADIO ) We 'll have to bring you in . I can 't land this plane . BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! ( PLUMMETING ) BOGG : We better swim for it , kid . JEFFREY : Bogg , put your feet down , you can walk right out . I knew that . I was just testing you . I don 't care what you say . The Omni needs a 60 zillion mile checkup . Quit complaining . We almost missed the lake , didn 't we ? Almost ? Funny , I don 't feel almost wet , I feel soaked . ( BEEPING ) Where are we anyway ? Pompton Lakes , New Jersey . June , 1938 . I 've never heard of Pompton Lakes . Red light 's blinking . Yeah , well , unless the ducks are in trouble ... Well , something 's wrong . We 'll find it . Come on . ( MEN CHATTERING ) Get out of the corner , Joe . MAN 1 : Come on , Joe . MAN 2 : Come on , Joe . Get off the ropes . Off the ropes . Come on , Joe . ( BELL DINGING ) MAN 3 : Come on , come on , come on . What is that ? What am I seeing here ? What am I seeing ? My mama could give Billy a better workout than that . I 'll pick it up this round . Three days , Joe , and we break camp . You know , this has turned out to be even bigger than just a title fight . Schmeling beat you two years ago and now he wants to beat you again . Only this time he 's out to prove something . Colored people got it tough enough without all this Aryan supremacy the Nazis are talking about . Am I supposed to give him a fight or run for office ? Give me the bell . ( BELL DINGING ) ( MEN CHATTERING ) Bogg , look . I see . Brown Bomber . You know who that is ? Are you kidding ? That 's Joe Louis , heavyweight champ . Maybe the best there ever was . Hey , I thought you said you were at the bottom of your class . And light heavyweight champ of my boxing team . This is my kind of history , kid . You never told me . Even I can be modest . Guess I never noticed . Next time . I think we found the place , let 's find the problem . Come on . Come on . Come on . JEFFREY : Why isn 't he fighting back ? BOGG : I think he 's trying . Well , he 's not trying very hard . The other guy is all over him . You noticed that too , huh ? Come on , Joe , come on . Get your hands up . Come on , Joe . Come on , Joe . MAN 1 : Oh , come on . Come on ! MAN 2 : Joe , what 's the matter with you ? Let 's go . Joe , what do you think you 're doing ? MAN 3 : Joe , you just can 't walk away . MAN 4 : Where you going , champ ? You 're not finished yet . Joe , you all right ? Stay here . Joe , now , look , don 't do this . Brown Bomber ? It 's more like the Brown Bummer . I have more than a hunch that 's why we 're here . Hey ! This is a closed camp . You guys get out of here . Yeah , we were just lost . Maybe you could ... You mean you better get lost . I mean , like yesterday . No kidding , fellows . We 're just lost . Out . What do you think ? I think maybe another time we 'll get acquainted , huh ? JACK : If you can 't handle Billy , what do you think Max Schmeling is going to do to you ? JOE : I know what Schmeling can do . So you lost to Schmeling , so what ? He beat me good . Joe , no one goes undefeated . Not Dempsey . Not Tunney . Not Baer . And not you . What 's the matter with you ? Nothing . No , no , no , come on , buddy , lay it out for me . Now , this is more than just a case of you losing your nerve . I know you too well for that . What is it ? Leave it alone , Jack . No , sir . You know , ever since you gave that interview two weeks ago , you 've been acting funny . Neglecting your training , letting yourself go soft . And that 's it , isn 't it ? That interview ! I said leave it ! No , sir , I 'm going to push it , Joe ! And don 't you walk out of here until you 've satisfied me , brother ! You really want to know , man ? You want the truth ? I 'll give you the truth . That man , that reporter , he was sharp . He knew , he let me know . If I lose that fight , everybody in the whole country 's gonna believe the black man isn 't good enough . My whole people , your people , Jack . How 'd you like that load laid on you , man ? But if I duck it , they can call me chicken not you , not Billy , not Seth . Just me , get it ? Just Joe Louis . He 's supposed to beat Schmeling , isn 't he ? Yeah . And the whole world is waiting for this rematch . What are we gonna do ? I got a great idea . Come on . That 's a great idea ? Bogg , who in their right mind would want to be a punching bag for Joe Louis ? Bogg . I was real good . I know how to protect myself . Against Joe Louis ? Listen , he 's gotta face somebody tough . Or at least somebody he thinks is tough . That 's why we 're here . Well , you saw him . The mood he 's in right now , he 's gonna lose that fight . You got a better idea ? I don 't mean any disrespect , Bogg . I mean , I 'm sure you were good and everything . But how are you gonna make them let you get in the ring with him ? I 'm going to let you talk them into it . Come on . Say , anybody seen Joe ? Some road work , I think . We should be so lucky . Seth , what 's going on ? Now don 't you guys come down on me . I can tell him how to train and when to train , but I can 't make him train . Hi . What ? Who are you ? I 'm Jeff , Jeffrey Jones from New York City . Well , what do you want , Jeffrey Jones from New York City ? And how in the blazes did you get in here ? I wanted to see the champ spar . Well , we 're through for the day . Besides , this is a closed camp . Yeah . I saw the session or whatever you call it . Yeah , well , that didn 't mean anything . Champ 's just having an off day , that 's all . Good . Then I guess you won 't need Bogg . Bogg , who 's Bogg ? Bogg , come here . Kommen Sie . ( IN GERMAN ACCENT ) Herr Bogg , at your service . Bogg 's one of Max Schmeling 's sparring partners . Or at least he was , until they fired him . Yeah ? How come ? They wanted Schmeling working with guys who could fight like Louis . Bogg here , all he knows how to do is fight like Schmeling . And what are you , his manager ? No , Bogg 's my uncle from the old country . Yeah , so ? Don 't you see ? Bogg would be a great sparring partner for Louis . Really get him ready for the fight . Schmeling no good . Bogg show Louis how to beat Schmeling . See , Bogg 's got a really big grudge . He 'll make Joe look good . Promise . What are you trying to say , kid ? I just thought it would be a good confidence builder for Joe , if he beat a German guy , a white German guy . And my uncle , he 's not real good . Oh , yeah ? Hey , Fred , Seth . Those two again . Sorry , Jack . I 'll get rid of them . No , forget it . I want you to go and find Joe . Right away . I don 't know , Bogg , he looks awfully solid . Well , what am I , chopped liver ? I just don 't want you to get hurt . We 're just sparring , kid . I know how to move , duck . If I go down , don 't worry . I just want him to know he could get to me . Hey , what 's the big idea ? I just want you to try this guy . He knows Schmeling 's style , sparred with him . Hey , I don 't need to do this . Oh , yes , you do . We both know that . This guy 's a bum . Now go on out there and do some work , huh ? JACK : Ready ? Give me the bell . ( BELL DINGING ) Got get him . MAN 1 : All right , let 's go . Let 's go . All right . ( ALL EXCLAIMING ) Look at this . MAN 2 : All right , that 's it . ( ALL CHATTERING ) Yeah , yeah , all right , come on . All right , all right , move in . MAN 3 : Come on , Joe . MAN 1 : Come on , now . Come on , keep your guard up . Oh , yeah . Your guard , come on . Yeah , yeah . Watch yourself . Don 't let him hurt you . MAN 1 : Easy , easy . All right . MAN 2 : That 's it . You got him going now . JEFFREY : Give him the old one , two . The old ein , zwei . MAN 3 : Come on , Joe , defense . MAN 1 : There you go , jab him , jab him . ( ALL EXCLAIMING ) Joe , you hurt ? Joe , are you all right , Joe ? Come on , let 's get him to the corner . Oh , no , I 've really done it . Get the stool . Get the stool . Where 's the stool ? That 's making him look good ? You 'll never see a luckier punch . I couldn 't do that again if my life depended on it . Stay tuned . It may . I guess you made your point , Jack . Oh , Joe , you looked great . The best in a long time . That punch was just a fluke . Who 're you kidding ? Schmeling 's gonna even be worse . Tell the promoters I 've been hurt . Tell them anything . I 'm not going to fight . Now , that 's crazy . This is the fight of the century , Joe . You heard me . It 's off ! And they will suspend you . Maybe even take away the title ! I don 't care what they do . The so-called fight of the century is not going to happen . Well , all right . So it didn 't exactly work out how I planned it . We 'll just have to think of something else . Bogg . It 's gonna be a little harder than I thought . Bogg ! What ? Hey , guys , we were just leaving . Don 't be in such a hurry . Right . We were pretty impressed . Come on , it was a punch in a million . I bet I could learn a lot from you , Herr Bogg . Why don 't we go a few rounds ? No way he could ever do that again . No . It was most unfortunate what happened . Unfortunate ? Nobody , but nobody sucker punches our man . In the ring , tough guy . Bogg , I don 't think he really just wants to spar with you . Well , at least he 's willing to put the gloves on . Look ... I 'm not interested in a knuckle sandwich . I 've got the Omni . Let 's just get out of here . Hang on to it . I don 't look for fights , but I don 't run from them either . Hey , where 's the mouth piece ? Anyone that can knock down Joe Louis doesn 't need one . Come on , man , get the other glove on . He 's gonna cream you . Just lace it up . I 'm sorry , pal . MAN ON RADIO ... Roger . US Columbia 14 cleared for flight level two eight thousand . Maintain heading and air speed . Over . Thank you , Tango control . This is US Columbia 14 . Out . Come on , Brooks , earn some money . All right . I got it . It 's your airplane . It 's big ditch time . Right . Ladies and gentlemen , this is your copilot again . In just a few moments you 'll be able to see the Grand Canyon out the port , make that the left side of the airplane . There 'll be no extra charge for this , except in coach . Are you sure I can 't get you a soft drink , Mr. Stewart ? ( PLUMMETING ) What ? No , no , no . Well , how about some coffee ? Hey , look . Right in the air . We never did this before . Why 'd you go and Omni us out for ? It was psyching him out . Look , I don 't like the sight of blood , okay ? Especially yours . ( BEEPING ) February , 1970 . Somewhere over Nevada . Red light . I guess somebody important is on this plane . I don 't know . Hurry up and get these off . May I help you , sir ? No , thanks . Guess you 're wondering why I got these on , huh ? Well , I sell them . And the kid here wanted to see how it 's done in the big league . Where are you sitting , sir ? Sitting ? What do you mean ? In the back . Right . Way back . May I see your tickets , please ? You got the tickets ? I thought you had the tickets . Thought he had the tickets . Wait here , please . I think we 're in trouble . At least they can 't throw us off . ( PHONE BUZZING ) Yeah . PATTY ... Mike , we 've got a couple of stowaways here . I think you better come on out . Got a couple of freebies . Freebies ? Yeah . US Colombia Airways . The stowaway 's favorite . Try and sell them first class . Good afternoon , folks . I 'm Copilot Dorfman . Am I correct in assuming that you do not have tickets for this flight ? Well , yeah . As a matter of airline policy , I can give you the opportunity to purchase tickets at this time , or ... Excuse me . Would you kindly wait until I 'm through ? This won 't wait , flyboy . You want to guess what 's in the case ? Mike ? Stay right where you are , lady . Do you hear me ? All of you just stay right where you are . Nobody is gonna get hurt if you pay attention and do exactly what I say . Let 's not alarm the whole plane . Anyway you want it . Just don 't get cute or we 'll all land very early a piece at a time . Now , the pilot here and I are going on the radio and open up the bidding . What ? Could I please go to my seat ? You see , my wife 's down there and I told her I 'd be right back . Don 't move . Don 't anyone get too near me either if my thumb slips . STEWART : And I want any executive jet with a 2,000 mile range . Two parachutes , no games . And finally , the suitcase . MAN ... A million dollars is an awful lot . We need more time . The banks are open , friend . Now , hold on . The pilot wants to talk to you . This is Brooks . We 've made a course correction for Salt Lake City , maintaining flight level two eight thousand . The automatic pilot is engaged . We are being removed from the cockpit . Clear the air corridor all the way in . Roger . We have radar contact . All traffic being advised . When will you call Salt Lake ? Over . Don 't call us . We 'll call you . PATTY : Under these difficult conditions . But you must remain calm . We are doing everything possible to ensure a prompt and safe landing . Because of the nature of the threat , the captain has asked that you remain in your seats at all times . We will keep you advised when we have any further information . We 're over the Rockies , headed for Salt Lake . Thank you for your cooperation . Captain , now , I suggest you keep the lid on out here . I know the rap on air piracy so I 'm not taking any chances . Now I 'm going back into the flight deck , just so nobody gets any funny ideas . Just in case , maybe I ought to bring you along just to keep me company . Bogg . Wait , no . Oh , yeah . Get in there , kid . Hold on a second . Take me in there with you . I won 't be any trouble . That 's a promise . Oh , I know that . Come on , kid , move . Leave him alone . I 'll go with you . Come on . Don 't even think about it , kid . I wasn 't . I 'll bet . ( SIGHS ) All right . In case you 're still wondering , let me just put all the doubts right out of your head . That doesn 't look like dynamite to me . That 's right . It 's not . But there 's enough shaped plastique in that case to blow the plane right in half . What are you doing now ? What , are you taking a professional interest ? Just curious . Before this case gets to be too popular , we 'll just add a little surprise in case I misplace it . What 's in those canisters ? Don 't get in an uproar . It 's not deadly . It 's just a knockout gas . What are you gonna do if you let it go , hold your breath ? No , wise guy . You know , the flight crew , they 've got their own oxygen . Now , if I had to I could get in here with one flyboy . That 's all I 'd need . What about the ... Oh , the magic masks . I already unplugged them so they 're not working . MAN ... ( ON RADIO ) US Columbia 14 , Salt Lake Center . US Columbia 14 , this is Salt Lake . Do you read ? Over . This is Stewart . You can cut the old Roger Wilco business . Do you have the money and the plane and everything I asked for ? Everything is as you requested . Are the crew and passengers all right ? Well , if you just keep doing your job , buster , you 'll be able to see for yourself . US Columbia 14 , you are 200 miles out and need course correction for approach . Over . All right , that means that you want a pilot , right ? Affirmative , US Columbia . We have new coordinates for ... All right , just hang on . All right , move . Hey , you okay ? Yeah . He 's got the briefcase ... Just shut up , kid ! All right , now , we 're getting close . Captain , you 're gonna land this bird alone . That 's not possible ... Forget it , forget the rules . We both know you can handle it . It 'll be okay . All right , now , once we reach the ground everyone just remain in your seat . No exceptions . Captain , let 's go . No matter what he does keep all the passengers calm . Bogg ! No , no ! The case is booby trapped . ( ALL COUGHING ) Don 't breathe ! Bogg ! Can anyone hear me ? MAN 1 ... US Columbia 14 . Salt Lake Center . Please answer . Do you read ? You 're getting pretty close now . US Columbia 14 , come in , please . US Columbia 14 . Salt Lake Center . Please answer . Do you read ? Do you read ? US Columbia 14 , come in . This is Salt Lake Center calling US Columbia 14 , please answer . ( GASPING ) Hello ? Hello ? Somebody ? I need help . Hello , can you hear me ? US Columbia 14 , this is Salt Lake Center . We hear you . Who is this speaking ? I 'm all alone . Nobody 's awake . I don 't know what to do . Slow down . Who is this speaking ? Jeffrey , Jeffrey Jones . Jones , did you ever fly an airplane ? Fly a plane ? Mister , I 'm just a kid . Now easy , son . All traffic around you has been cleared , so you 're not going to hit anybody . Now , just relax and tell me what 's going on up there . How long since the gas was released ? Not more than 10 minutes ago . Okay , you 're doing fine , Jeffrey . You 're gonna make a great reporter someday . Someday is right . Now listen , you 've got a lot to do . We don 't know anything about that gas or how long until somebody wakes up . What we do know is that your plane has to come down now . We 'll have to bring you in . What ? Me ? I can 't land this plane . Well , now , that little airplane you 're in can almost land itself . You might need to give it just a little help , that 's all . MAN 2 ... Hey , Jonesy ! You still awake up there ? JEFFREY ... Yeah , who 's this ? Why , this here is the best dang pilot that money can buy . You and me are gonna have a whale of a time while you solo this baby . JEFFREY ... Solo ? You 're gonna bring it right on home . How are you in a go-cart ? No sweat . Neither is this . Your captain set you just right for Salt Lake and you are right on course . Okay . MAN 2 ... It 's about time for you to do your first trick . Are you ready ? I guess . Sure you are . Now , Jeffrey , straight in front of you , just about level with your chin , slightly on the right , there 's a dial that reads 116.8 I think I see it . Okay , now , when I tell you , I want you to turn that knob so it reads 110 . 7 . 110.7 . That 's right . Now , take hold of it . I 've got it . Ready , set , turn it . 110.7 . Good , good boy . Now , right up over that dial , over the windshield , it 's marked landing , there are four switches . Do you see them ? JEFFREY : Yeah . You take hold of those and ease them all up at the same time . Now ? You bet . All right . Well , now , aren 't you something ? Do you know what you just did ? Uh-uh . You just got yourself all ready to land that baby . You activated the automatic landing system . JEFFREY : I did ? I can see you on the radar screen . You 're doing great . Now , son , down by your right knee there 's a dial that shows your air speed . Does it have a knob on it ? That 's the baby . Take hold and turn it to 140 . Okay . MAN ON PA ... All emergency vehicles to runway 26 left . Emergency landing in progress . All emergency vehicles to runway 26 left . Emergency landing in progress . ( SIRENS WAILING ) MAN 2 ... Okay , partner , this is where the home cooking is . Come on in . MAN ON PA ... All emergency vehicles to runway 26 left . Emergency landing in progress . All emergency vehicles to runway 26 left . Hey , we 're almost there . Don 't start getting fidgety on me . JEFFREY ... I 'm trying not to . I 'll bet you got that seat all the way up like I told you . Yes , sir . MAN 2 ... You can reach the brakes now , can 't you ? You mean I have to stop the plane ? Piece of cake , Jeffrey . Piece of cake . Now , on the floor , by your feet , two pedals , just like in a car ? Yeah . Well , you get those old toes ready , 'cause just as soon as that bird kisses the ground you 're gonna push on those at the same time . Okay . Ready now ? Yeah . MAN 2 ... Now , push ! ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ( SIREN WAILING ) Harder , Jeffrey . Harder ! I 'm trying ! I 'm trying ! Stand on them , boy ! Well ? MAN 2 ... Well , what ? We 're down . I did it . I can 't believe it . Oh , you barnstormers are all alike . Always trying to make the easy things look tough . Welcome home , partner . Jeffrey , when you want to be a pilot , come see me . Thanks a lot . You bet . Thank you , partner . All right . See you around , Cap . Bogg , you should have seen it . It was incredible . Sorry . I don 't usually sleep on the job . I 'm real proud of you . Thanks . Hey , I wonder how we really changed history on this flight . Are you kidding ? All those lives . You don 't have to be big and important , you know . Every life 's a part of history . ( OMNI DINGS ) Who knows ? Somebody famous might have been aboard . Bogg . What ? Never mind . You wouldn 't believe me anyway . ( PLUMMETING ) Well , at least we missed the lake this time . The Omni never makes the same mistake twice . ( MAN CHATTERING ON SCREEN ) Louis goes to his knees , hangs on the ropes . Can it be over ? He 's defenseless . Now , close to the end , Louis can 't get up . Joe Louis has been knocked down . He has lost ... Joe Louis has suffered ... Mr. Louis . Okay , you 've seen the show so beat it . That was Schmeling , huh ? Yeah . The one still standing . Joe , listen , I 'm not really a fighter , at least not in your league . Hey , what happened to your accent ? Well , I 'm not really German either . Who sent you here ? Nobody exactly . But we 're here to help . I don 't need any help . Especially yours . But you 've got to beat Schmeling . I 'm not even fighting Schmeling . Or anybody else . I 'm retired . I 'm going home tomorrow . So get out . I want to pack . What are you waiting on ? You want me to call the boys ? Come on , give us a break , Joe . We know what you 're thinking . I 'm not thinking of nothing . Look , everybody gets scared . Just think how scared Schmeling must be knowing that you 're better than he is . Schmeling isn 't scared of me . The master race isn 't scared of anybody . That 's garbage and you know it . Do I ? Don 't you think I know what people are saying ? What the Nazis are doing ? Mister , we 're not talking about just another fight . That 's why you can 't back down . You 've got to show them . A black man can 't lose . Not in these times . You 're wrong , Joe . A black man can win or lose . You think your people are gonna feel any better because you won 't face him ? I can take that rap . Well , what 's the difference between getting beat and looking like you 're afraid to get beat ? What 's the difference ? Man , there 's a big difference . If I go down again to that man , everybody loses . Not just black people but everybody who doesn 't have blond hair or blue eyes . I bet Jesse Owens didn 't think like that . Two years ago at the Olympics , he stuck it right in Hitler 's eye . Now , you 've got the chance to stick it in his other eye . That 's if I win . Well , if you don 't try , we 'll never know , will we ? Aren 't you boys listening to me ? There 's just too much to lose here . Even if you do lose , you 'll still be proving something . Yeah , that they 're right . No . That the son of a sharecropper from Alabama tried to be the best in the world at what he does . Joe ? I got to think . I gotta go for a walk . I got to think . You seen him ? No , I haven 't seen him . Bogg , wake up ! Where 's Joe ? I fell asleep . Me , too . How long can his walk take ? I don 't know . We gave him a lot to think about . Come on . Uh-oh . Just the guys we want to see . That 's far enough . Look , we don 't want any trouble , all right ? Oh , it 's not gonna be any trouble . Not for me anyway . Hey , isn 't Joe with you guys ? What 's going on here ? I thought you were German . JOE : He 's not German . I don 't know what he is , but he and the kid ... Well , they help remind me of a couple of things . And you know everybody doesn 't dream about being a boxer but they all dream about being something . And I don 't want them to ever back off like I was thinking about doing . You mean you 're gonna fight Schmeling ? ( ALL CHEERING ) Say , look at you , you haven 't been working hard . ( BEEPING ) It 's still red . What ? It can 't be . You know , that fight 's coming up pretty quick ? You 're flabby , champ . I know I 'm out of shape , but I gotta try . Try , heck . You 're soft , man . There 's still time , Joe . Haven 't any of you guys heard of Rocky Balboa ? BOGG : Who 's Rocky Balboa ? MAN 1 : Never heard of him . MAN 2 : The explorer ? MAN 3 : Rocky who ? It doesn 't matter . I know just what to do . Come on . Kid , if Joe eats that side of beef you 'll be able to beat him . What is this ? ( BELL DINGING ) JACK : Go ahead , pop him , pop him . Jab ! Get him ! Come on , Joe , you can pull him . JEFFREY : All right , get him , champ . Don 't let him hurt you . Get that body . Back , Joe . JEFFREY : Yeah , all right , champ . BOGG : Come on , Joe , you pull him . Yeah , all right . Keep your guard up , Joe . Keep the guard up , come on . All right , you 're looking good . You can do it ! Come on , Joe ! Get him , yeah . Come on , Joe , look at that man move . You 're looking great , champ . Come on , champ ! ( ALL CHEERING ) JEFFREY : Now that 's the Brown Bomber . Champ , champ , you 're ready , man . You are ready . ( CROWD CHEERING ) ANNOUNCER ... Now , Louis moves in one more time on Schmeling , and he staggers him with a right upper cut to the head . Snaps his head back . Topples him now . And Schmeling is holding onto the ropes . We 're only in the first round , but it is Louis who is taking control of this fight . The rematch has Louis pounding Schmeling . Schmeling staggering away now . Louis moves in with the left hand ... He 's all over him . Right . But how can he keep that up for 15 rounds ? Just watch . ( SPEAKING GERMAN ) I wonder what those guys just said . ANNOUNCER ... ... continues the way it 's going right now . Because it is Joe Louis with a left to the mid section and a right to the head . Another right to the head . And Schmeling now ... One ! The two fighters get back in there ... ( CROWD CHEERING ) Schmeling is down . He rolled out on the canvas . Yeah ! Joe Louis has sent Schmeling down . He staggered . He 's dazed . He 's not quite sure where he is . It is Louis moving in for the kill . Louis with a right to left . Louis with another left hand . Louis with a right hand , and Schmeling goes down . ( SPEAKING GERMAN ) ANNOUNCER ... ... Schmeling is down . Joe Louis trying to gain revenge . The corner man now getting up . He throws the towel in the ring . He throws the towel away . The referee trying to get back . It 's all over . It 's over . Joe Louis has successfully retained his heavyweight title to the world with a time of two minutes and four seconds in the first round . Joe Louis with his gloves held high . Max Schmeling helped into his corner . Joe Louis has won the rematch with Max Schmeling . It is all over . JEFFREY ... If you wanna learn more about Joe Louis and the sport of boxing , or modern aviation , take a voyage down to your public library . It 's all in books ! Could you tell us where we might find Alexander Graham Bell ? That 's an easy enough request . ( EXCLAIMING ) Mr. Watson , come here , I want you ! ( EXCLAIMING ) The telephone has been born . I 'm gonna give you the Phineas Bogg crash course on how to be comfortable around men . ( LAUGHING ) Phineas . Bell and Mabel are supposed to get married . You don 't understand , I love her . We can 't change history . BOGG ... I can 't give her up . BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Nice landing , Bogg . Just be glad we missed the outhouse . Bat 's breath . I think I sprained my knee . You okay ? For once I was prepared for this . Jim Thorpe 's old football equipment worked great . You should have borrowed some . I 've traveled like this long before I met you , you know , and I get by just fine . Whatever you say . Now , where are we ? ( BEEPING ) Texas , 1890 . Hey , what 's going on ? What in Sam Hill hit the chicken coop ? I think we did . What for ? Well , you see , we were gonna ... You two are a little early for Halloween , ain 't you ? Ain 't for two weeks yet . Yeah . Yeah , we thought we should get a jump on the other kids . Your friend 's a pretty big kid . Hey , look , sonny , you better run along . This ain 't no place for a child right now . Wait . Something wrong ? There 's a woman in there having a mess of trouble trying to birth her baby . Your wife ? No , Mrs. Eisenhower . My wife and I just come over to help out while Mr. Eisenhower went to fetch a doc . Eisenhower ? It 's a two-day ride to the nearest doctor . I don 't think that poor woman can make it through the night . President Eisenhower ? President who ? Never mind . Do you know if the Eisenhowers were gonna name their baby Dwight David ? Yeah . If it was a boy . But how did you ... Don 't make no never mind anyhow 'cause that baby ain 't gonna need a name except one to put on his tombstone . Tombstone ? Ain 't you been listening ? I told you that woman is bad off . My wife 's birthed a lot of babies , but she ain 't no doctor . Why don 't you just call one ? Call one ? What do you think , there 's one just standing out there in field or something ? No , I mean , call one on the phone . Telegraph ? No telephone . Haven 't you ever heard of it ? You know , you talk through it to someone hundreds of miles away . Without a code ? Just your own voice ? Yeah . You two from another planet ? No , seriously , it was invented 13 , 14 years ago by Alexander Graham Bell . You should have one in your house by now . A thing you talk through and people can hear what you say a hundred miles away ? A thousand miles away . Pixilated . That 's it . A classic case of pixilation if I ever seen one . You really ... You don 't understand . You see , we were just trying to ... Guess something happened to the telephone , huh ? Yeah . Without it President Eisenhower won 't be born and who knows how many other problems it 'll cause . Better check it out . Boston , 1875 or 1876 , I don 't remember which . ( PLUMMETING ) Hey , that 's what I call a landing . Good . You can keep your crash gear , kid . I think I 'm starting to get the hang of this . Yeah , until next time . ( BEEPING ) Boston , summer of 1875 . Red light . Got any ideas where we can find Bell ? What we need is a phone book . ( EXPLOSION ) Look out , it 's a run away ! Hey , lady , look out ! Get out of the way ! JEFFREY : Bogg , she 's gonna get hit . Hey , lady ! Are you all right ? Are you all right ? That wagon almost hit me . Didn 't you hear everybody yelling at you to watch out ? Hey , is she all right ? I 'm trying to find out . She won 't answer me . Hey , lady , I 'm talking to you . Hey , what 's the matter , can 't you hear ? No , I 'm deaf . Oh . I 'm sorry , I didn 't realize . Bogg , she can 't hear you . She 's got to see your face so she can read your lips . No wonder she couldn 't hear the wagon . Hey , are you okay ? You saved me , didn 't you ? I guess . I 'm sorry . Nothing to be sorry about . But I was delighted to save you . I 'm Phineas Bogg . This is Jeffrey Jones . My name is Mabel Hubbard . But please , I have to go now . I 'm late for class . Don 't run off . We 'll walk you to school . Bogg , we 've have to find Bell , remember ? Relax . Where do you go to school ? Boston University , but please , I don 't want you to walk me . I caused enough trouble as it is already . Well , being deaf is nothing to be ashamed of . We could ... Bogg , I think I remember something about Bell teaching at Boston University . See . You almost let her get away . Hey , least you could do is let me walk you to school after I saved your life . Well , okay . As you wish . She 's cute , isn 't she ? Kind of shy if you ask me . Well , I like them shy . You like them period . No , really , still waters run deep , you know . Bogg , give the poor girl a break . She 's got enough problems as it is being deaf . Besides , we 've gotta find Bell . Well , maybe Mabel can help . Besides , I think it 's time we included her in the conversation . I feel like we 're talking behind her back . I guess we 're being kind of rude . Mabel , do you know a man named Alexander Graham Bell ? He 's a teacher of the deaf at the university . MABEL : Father , what are you doing here ? Where have you been , young lady ? You 're an hour late for class . You know my stand on punctuality , never late , never sorry . Since when do you come to school to check up on me ? Since you snuck away from your governess this morning . Father , I 'm too old to have a governess . I can take care of myself . You can 't even get yourself to class on time . Who are these two strange looking characters ? Mr. Hubbard , I can explain . Sir , if you 're ... There was an accident , Father . They saved my life . An accident ? Oh , my God . No , really , sir . It wasn 't that bad . I didn 't hear a runaway wagon . Mr. Bogg pulled me out of the way . I 'm most grateful to you , sir . Why can 't I get it through that pretty head of yours how dangerous it is for a deaf girl to walk the streets alone ? Please , Father , don 't go into this now . Not in front of strangers . I 'll talk in front of whomever I wish . Your governess was hired to protect you from just that kind of thing . I deserve a life of my own . So you do , and you shall have that life of your own as long as your governess is with you . But I 'll not have you endanger your own life . I can 't hear you , Father . I 've got my eyes closed . I hate it when she does that . Pretty good way to end a conversation . She 's perfected it to an art . Go to class , we 'll talk later . I 'll see you at home , Father . Thank you . Excuse me , Mr. Hubbard . Could you tell us where we might find Alexander Graham Bell ? Professor Bell ? That 's an easy enough request . He 's over there in the gazebo . He 's working with Tom Saunder 's little boy . He 's the best teacher of the deaf I 've ever seen . I hired him to help Mabel when she was younger with her pronunciation . Yes , sir , she told us . He 's a great inventor , too . So he tried to convince me once . I 'm a patent attorney . I 've seen enough of men 's folly . Mr. Bell is a very good teacher of the deaf . He should continue doing that . Well , I have an appointment , but here 's my card . If I can be of any further help ... Good day , sir . Thank you again . ( PRONOUNCING SLOWLY ) Cat . Cat . Cat . Cat . Good , Georgie , good . Can I help you ? Are you Professor Bell ? Yes , I am . Could we talk to you a moment ? Certainly . Georgie 's finished with his lesson . Just let me dismiss him . Is the glove an invention of yours ? I wouldn 't call it an invention . It 's more of a teaching tool . See , Georgie can neither hear nor read lips . To get him to speak I had to come up with a way to communicate with him . We 're interested in another one of your inventions . Really . Which one ? The telephone . Oh , that . I 'm surprised you 've heard of it . What 's left of it is around my shop collecting dust . But why ? Well , I spend my days teaching so I 'll have the money to pay for my rent and eat a few meals . That only leaves me my nights free to work on a more lucrative invention , the harmonic telegraph . But the telephone is worth millions . So I 've tried to convince my backers , but they were only willing to give me a small sum , a very small sum to continue my experiments on the telegraph . Wait a minute , aren 't you married or engaged ? Me ? I have no money to support a wife . Not even a girlfriend ? I teach all day and work on my telegraph at night . Who has time for courting ? Something coming to you ? Yeah . If you 'll excuse me , I have to get to my lecture . If you 'd like to see my telegraph , you 're welcome to stop by my shop . It 's also my home . We 'd like that . Fine . It 's at 409 Court Street . When I 'm not here , I 'm there . You okay ? It 's all coming back to me now . What ? Now I know why I feel so weird . I 've seen all this before . How ? On the late show . Don Ameche played Alexander Graham Bell . You mean they made a movie about all this ? Yeah . Bell got all the money he needed for his experiments from his wife 's father . You wouldn 't happen to remember his wife 's name , would you ? I think it was Mabel . Mabel ? Like the girl we saved today , Mabel ? Yeah , and her father in the movie was a patent attorney , just like Mr. Hubbard . Mr. Hubbard . Which means that Bell is supposed to marry Mabel Hubbard . Exactly . They barely know each other . I know . I think that 's why we 're here . So , we got to get Mabel Hubbard and Alexander Graham Bell to fall in love . Come on . The way I see it , we got two problems . Mabel 's too shy and inhibited to meet a man , and Bell doesn 't have enough time to meet a woman . Swell , now that you 've figured that out , what are we gonna do about it ? Well , wise guy , one of us should bring Mabel out of her shell , and the other should convince Bell he should get married . I 've got a feeling I 'm the one who has to convince Bell . No , I thought I should . Why ? You saw how shy Mabel was . A young boy would be less threatening to her . No . I don 't think she 's gonna listen to a kid . Besides , you 're much better with women . You 're right . You go over to Bell 's this afternoon . I 'll pay Mabel a visit . I hope she 'll see you . I saved her life , of course she 'll see me . Miss Hubbard sends her regrets , but she can 't see you . Why not ? She didn 't say and I didn 't ask . Did you tell her I 'm Phineas Bogg , the guy that saved her life this morning ? Yes , and she said she 's very grateful . Well , she has a fine way of showing her gratitude . Mabel ! Mabel ! Mabel . It won 't do no good to yell , Mr. Bogg , she 's deaf . Yeah , but she can see my lips moving . I 'm just gonna yell louder until she comes down here . In fact , I 'm gonna yell so loud the whole neighborhood 's gonna know that Mabel ... Please , Mr. Bogg , stop , I 'll come down . I 'll be waiting . Hiya . Mr. Bogg , you should not have shouted like that . This is a very quiet neighborhood . Why wouldn 't you see me ? I couldn 't . I can 't . Why couldn 't you ? I was afraid . Afraid of what ? My experiences with men are limited . You don 't need experience . I just want to be friends . I thought maybe we 'd both enjoy taking a ride and get something to eat . Alone . You mean , me and you ? Why make it sound so terrible ? But ... I promise if you don 't have a good time I 'll take you right back . No , I can 't . Father wouldn 't allow it . Well , let 's ask him . He 's not home . Well , good , then he 's not here to say no . But when he finds out ... If he starts yelling at you , all you gotta do is close your eyes . I get away with a lot when I do that . I noticed . It 's a cute trick . Well , I am kind of hungry . Good . Now , let 's go . This is your lab ? Well , we like to call it home . Since we work here and eat here and sleep here . Maybe we should call it prison . You should 've seen the lab Edison has . You know him ? Sort of . I hear he 's very good . That he 's made some remarkable improvements on the telegraph . Yeah , but nothing like what you 're doing . That 's why they call his work improvements and ours experiments . Don 't mind Watson , he 's been working too hard . What 's this harmonic telegraph you told me you were working on ? Well , for right now you can only send one message at a time over a telegraph wire . If mine will work , you 'll be able to send many different messages at the same time . Well , it 's nothing compared to what the telephone can do . Well , of course , the telephone can 't do anything at all . It will . It 's gonna be one of the greatest inventions of all time . It 's nice to have one believer . Can I see it ? Well , we haven 't worked on it in months . Where did we put it , Watson ? Here you go , kid , the greatest invention of all time . BELL : Don 't pay any attention to Watson . JEFFREY : Does it work ? Well , if it worked , we wouldn 't let it sit around and collect dust . Why 'd you stop ? The almighty dollar . We worked on it till the money ran out . But you have money to work on the harmonic telegraph . Barely . The father of the boy I teach , Mr. Sanders , gives me just enough money to pay for this room and some supplies . And he gives me that money to work on the telegraph , not on the telephone . I 'm afraid this will have to wait until I make some money on inventions other people believe in . Tomorrow you 're gonna meet a woman who 's gonna solve all your problems . A woman ? You remember them , Aleck ? They 're soft , they wear dresses . Their voices have a higher pitch than men 's . I think we used to take them out on dates once in a while . I remember . Jeffrey , as much as I would like to meet a woman , I do not have the time . Besides , I do not have the money or the place to entertain . It 's not just for romance . You could talk some business , too . What kind of business ? Well , her father 's a wealthy patent attorney . He can give you the money you need for the telephone . This woman 's name wouldn 't be Hubbard , would it ? Yeah , Mabel Hubbard . Why , I taught Mabel years ago . She 's very young . Not anymore , she 's all grown up . Well , it really wouldn 't work anyway because I 've already asked Mr. Hubbard for financial support . He was not interested in my invention . But Mabel can talk her father into anything . You convince her , she 'll convince her father . I would never use a woman to obtain money . Forget the money . Just see her because you 're a lonely old grouch and her company would probably do you some good . No , I can 't , I 'm much too busy . Well , you have to make time . She 's already planning to come over tomorrow . ( WHISPERING ) I hope . MAN : Hey , waiter . Chocolate cake . Waiter ! We ordered cherry phosphate , not lemonade . Oh , my , you 're right . I 'm sorry . Look , it 's my first day . It 's too much . I just can 't handle it all . That 's okay . Lemonade 's fine , really . Thank you , so much . Thanks . You haven 't said a word since we left your house . I don 't know what to say . Come on , relax . ( SIGHING ) I think we better get back now . We just got here . I shouldn 't be doing this . I promised myself I wouldn 't see men anymore . And why is that ? I 'm deaf . Men aren 't interested in a deaf wife . That 's not true . I 'm afraid it is . A lot of men approach me because they find me attractive . But you ought to see how the looks on their faces change when I tell them I 'm deaf . Suddenly , they don 't come around anymore . I 'm sorry , I guess I didn 't understand . Oh , it 's okay . Ever since the last one , I learned to accept it . You want to tell me about it ? There was this boy , I loved him very much . So much that I pretended I could hear . He was handsome and smart . Worst of all he was a musician . I never took my eyes off his face for fear I 'd miss something he said and he 'd find out . So , I commented on how birds sang , how pleasant crickets sounded on summer 's evening , and I 'd spend hours listening to him play a piano that I couldn 't hear . What happened ? On the night that he took me to meet his parents I sat at the dinner table frantically watching everyone 's lips . I didn 't hear the maid drop a stack of plates behind me . And that 's it ? He stopped seeing you ? Not right away . He was a nice boy . He saw me one more time and pretended that it didn 't matter . Then I got a very sweet letter . Look , I don 't know what to say . That 's a sad story , but everybody is not like that . Sure . Listen , I know somebody you should meet . Somebody that wouldn 't care at all that you 're deaf . Look , some other time , all right . No , really . In fact he already knows you can 't hear . It 's Alexander Bell . Professor Bell ? My old teacher ? Yeah . Oh , I 'm sorry . Let me clean that off . I 'll get some water . Let me ... I 'll get some water . ( LAUGHING ) What 's so funny ? How could you ? How could I what ? You mean this ? Oh , no . You wouldn 't . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Don 't answer it , it 's probably the bill collector . Probably the bill collector . Hey . How did it go ? Pretty well . Does Bell want to meet Mabel ? Yeah , I even think he 's excited about it . Bring her over about 4 : 00 . He 's got classes till noon , and I 'll need the rest of the time to get him ready . Good , I need time to teach a little class of my own . See you . But why do you want me to meet Mr. Bell ? I mean , he 's got long hair and he dresses funny . Oh , so what ? What did I look like when you first met me ? Oh , yeah . What do you mean , oh , yeah ? Oh , I don 't know , Phineas . I mean , I get so nervous and shy around men . Don 't worry , if you can get used to me you can get used to anybody . Besides , I 'm gonna give you the Phineas Bogg crash course on how to be comfortable around men . This should be interesting . No , really . Start out by being light , happy . Smile a lot . Laugh a lot . What if he doesn 't say anything funny ? Laugh anyway . And if he starts talking about things you don 't understand , just nod your head , yes , throw in a couple of uh-huh 's . And when he pauses , say something like , " That 's very interesting . " Even if it 's not ? Especially if it 's not . Well , what if he doesn 't say anything at all ? Easy , you ask him a question about himself . Pretend he 's the most interesting man in the whole world . What if he asks me to dance ? He 's not gonna ask you to dance . You never know , Phineas . You know , you don 't have to hear to be able to dance . Well , don 't you think it would be nice if I could keep step with the music ? You can . Get up . Come on . ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ) Okay . Okay , now , just follow me . Ready ? ( HUMMING ) There 's just one problem . What 's that ? I can 't watch the music and my feet at the same time . Well , don 't watch your feet . Just move with my body . ( LAUGHING ) Phineas , this is wonderful . You 're doing great . I never knew dancing could be so much fun . That last step was murder . Are you okay ? I can 't remember when I 've felt better . Mabel should be here any minute . I got to go . Jeffrey , Jeffrey , you don 't have to run off . I 'm sure Mabel wouldn 't mind if you stayed . Mr. Bell , you 're on your own . Mabel . Mabel , about what happened back there . Yes , Phineas ? It shouldn 't have . It was a mistake . Yeah , of course . I mean we both got carried away in the lesson , that 's all . You 're right . The whole purpose was to get you at ease around men enough to meet Mr. Bell . I guess we got a little too at ease . Yeah . Okay , remember everything I told you ? Big smile , light , happy , attentive . Good . He 's gonna be crazy about you . I hope so . I wouldn 't want to let down my teacher . How nice to see you again , Professor Bell . Jeffrey was right , you have grown up . ( LAUGHING ) What an amusing thing to say . I didn 't mean it to be amusing . I ... May I come in ? Oh , of course . Please , sit down . So far so good . You think so ? She got through the door okay . He didn 't trip . So , Mr. Bell , I ... Please , call me Aleck . Please , call me Mabel . So , Aleck , I hear you 're quite an inventor . I hope so . You know , there 's one particular invention I 'm very excited about . It 's a device that will send the human voice through a wire much the same way a telegraph does . Really ? I 'd love to see how it works . And I 'd love to show it you but I 'm afraid it 's impossible . Yeah , I guess it would be a waste showing me , since I can 't hear the human voice or anything else . No , no , that 's not it at all . I can 't show it to you because it doesn 't work yet . Oh . Well , it was certainly nice of you to invite me over like this . Invite you ? But I ... I mean , Jeffrey said that you were coming by and ... You didn 't invite me ? Well , I would have if I had thought of it but ... But you didn 't . ( SIGHING ) Oh , I get it . Phineas Bogg asked you to see me . No , that 's not it at all . It 's just that I make a practice of not getting involved with any of my female students . Because they 're deaf ? No . ( SOBBING ) No , it 's because usually they 're too young . Sure , I understand . It 's all right , Mr. Bell . I mean , there 's no reason you should be any different than any of the others . What are you talking about ? Men . None of them , including you , could ever get serious about a deaf girl . I mean , you have to see them all day at school . Why do you want to be bothered with them when you get home ? That 's not ... That 's not true , Mabel . In fact , there 's one deaf woman in particular I 'm very serious about . I used to go home to her every day . Who 's the lucky girl ? My mother . I 'm sorry , I didn 't know . No , there 's no reason to be sorry . She is a great woman . And she taught me that it doesn 't matter if you can hear or see , or walk . The important thing is what kind of a person you are in spite of it all . Right now , I feel like a fool . No , no , you 're not . You 're a beautiful , intelligent woman who 's probably been hurt a few times . So you 're deaf . I 'm not incredibly handsome . Does that make us any less as people ? No , I guess not . I guess not . Here , dry your eyes and I 'm gonna show you a great invention that doesn 't work . Well , I 'm ready to receive when you 're ready to send . Be ready in a minute . So you like her . Mabel ? Yes . But do you really like her ? She has a spirit that 's irresistible . And she 's pretty too . Very . And , yes , I want to see her again . All right ! Soon . But for right now let 's concentrate on the harmonic telegraph . You know , I bet if you were engaged to Mabel , Mr. Hubbard would give you the financial support for your inventions . Boy , you like to rush things . All we know is I like her . We still don 't know if she likes me . Oh , she does . ( SIGHING ) I haven 't had a chance to ask you how it went with Mr. Bell today . I thought you were watching . The kid made me leave about halfway through . Well , I had a very nice time . Oh , good , good . You talked ? Yeah , we talked a lot . He is a very interesting man . Did you know that he 's perfected a form of visible speech whereby a person can imitate a sound he 's never heard ? No , no , I didn 't know that . So you really liked him , huh ? He 's quite an original man . He 's warm , sensitive , intelligent . And he made me feel very much at ease . Yeah , I liked him , quite a lot . Do you think you could love a man like Bell ? Yes , I think I could . Hey , great . ' Cause ... I could , that is , if I wasn 't already in love with you . ( TAPPING ) Nothing happened on the third one . The free end of the reed must be too close to the electromagnetic pole . It 's probably frozen . See if you can pluck it free . Okay . Bogg , come here , you gotta see this . I got to talk to you . Look , I hope you understand what I 'm gonna tell you . I don 't like it when you get serious . Yeah , well , this is serious . No , I can 't go on with this anymore . On with what ? Bell and Mabel . We got to find some other way to get the money for the telephone . Why ? Because I love Mabel , and she loves me . And I can 't give her up . I mean it , I 've never felt this way about anyone before . But we have a job to do . I know . We 'll figure some other way to get the money . No ! We can 't change history . Why am I telling you this ? You 're the one who 's always telling me . Bell and Mabel are supposed to get married . You don 't understand , I love her . I 've heard that one before . No , you haven 't . I 've fallen for a few in my time but I never said I loved any of them . So what do you plan to do , stop being a voyager , stay home and raise kids ? I know that sounds crazy , but right now that 's exactly what I feel like doing . No , Bogg , it doesn 't just sound crazy , it is crazy . Yeah , well , it 's hard traveling around all the time , you know . Just when I get close to somebody I got to leave again . I know , I get lonely , too . But like it or not we 've got the most important job in history . And if we don 't do that job , history is gonna change . Telephone won 't be invented , Eisenhower won 't be born and millions of other things will be different . You 're not telling me anything I haven 't already told myself . The fact is , kid , I don 't know what I 'm gonna do . ( VIBRATING ) Watson ! Watson , what are you doing ? I 'm plucking the reed free . Keep doing it , I can hear the vibrations . This is it ! It 's generating audible sounds . What 's going on ? I can hear the exact sound Watson is producing . I can hear its timbre . No less complex or subtle than the sound of symphonies . And speech . Yes . And speech . Does this mean you 've invented the phone ? No , no , I 'm afraid I 'm a long way from that . But this proves it will work . You mean , we finally made progress ? Good progress . We still need money for supplies . Without it , we 're not much further along . Yes , but now you can convince people . Now that this has happened ? No , they won 't know what this means , how much closer we are . The telephone has been born . But for a while , a long while , it will remain an infant . ( BEEPING ) Good morning , sweetheart . Is there something wrong ? With me ? No , no , couldn 't be better . So , where do you want to go for lunch ? Well , I really just came by to say I couldn 't go . What ? Why not ? I just have some things I got to do . But last night , we made plans . I know , I know , but things change . We 've seen too much of each other already . Well , it hasn 't been too much for me . See , that 's what I was afraid of . You 're getting too attached . Too attached ? Yeah , I mean I 'm not the kind of guy that gets serious . I like to stay loose , on the move . I don 't want any woman hanging on . But last night ... I mean , you said you loved me . Did I ? Well , I guess , I say that to a lot of girls . Oh , please , Phineas , don 't talk like this . It 's like I don 't even know you . Look , this is the real Phineas Bogg , okay ? I 'll say anything or do anything to get a girl interested . Please , Phineas , I know that 's not true . Well , face it , will you ? You 're just another pretty face to me . You don 't mean any more to me than the girl I met last week or the girl I 'll probably meet tomorrow . ( SOBBING ) Mabel , I hope someday you can forgive me . And I hope someday I can forget how much I love you . I 'm glad you came over , Mabel . Did you really mean all those things you said the other day ? Of course . I may not be much , but I am honest . I 'll be honest with you , too . I came over here today because someone I thought I really cared about hurt me badly . I understand . I just needed someone to lean on , a shoulder to cry on . You were the first person I thought of . I 'm glad you did , Mabel . Here 's my shoulder . It 's all yours . Come on . You did the right thing . I don 't know . If there was a medal for voyager action above and beyond the call of duty , you 'd deserve it . Thanks . ( DINGS ) Green light , let 's get out of here , huh ? We gotta see the telephone get invented . How long before that happens ? I think I remember from the late show it was sometime in March . Okay , we 'll Omni forward . But if Mabel 's there , I don 't think I 'll be able to stick around . It 's March , all right , and it 's coming in like a lion . Yeah , let 's get inside . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Well , I 'll be . We thought we lost you two forever . Aleck , look who 's here . Where have you two been ? We had to go away for a while . Well , I 'm glad you 're back . And I have great news . Mabel and I are engaged . Congratulations , that 's great . You 're a lucky man . You don 't have to tell me . And if it wasn 't for the two of you I never would have gotten to know her . Hey , did Mr. Hubbard finally come around and give you support ? You were right , Jeffrey , Mabel talked him into it . Great . Come , we were just about to try something new . Inside this cone I have placed a diaphragm much like the eardrum in your ear . When I talk into it , the vibrations are sent through this wire that sits in the water . That causes an electric current that varies and those variations are sent to the receiving diaphragm , reproducing the human voice . When you gonna try it ? Right now . Jeffrey , you and Watson go in the other room . Mr. Bogg , you can stay with me . Don 't get your hopes up too high , kid . This ain 't the first time we tried this . We 've been at this thing for three hours . It 's never going to work . Sure it is , it has to . Yeah , well , if a miracle happens you wake me up . I 'm gonna take a nap . I don 't understand , it should work . Why is the wire in the water ? Water acts as a conductor for the electricity . Maybe it 's not a good enough conductor . I can fix that . This acid will make it a better conductor . Let 's see if it works any better . ( EXCLAIMING ) Mr. Watson , come here , I want you ! Mr. Watson ! It works ! It works ! Watson , wake up , it works ! Mr. Watson ! Come here , I want you ! ( EXCLAIMING ) We heard your voice ! You should have , I was yelling loud enough . I dropped acid on my leg . No , we heard your voice over the wire . You did ? It works . It works ! It works ! ( BABY CRYING ) He 's crying . He 's all right . It 's a boy . No , I don 't have to see it to know it 's a boy . His name is Dwight David and he 's gonna be president . Yeah , I 'll ask them . How 's the mother ? BOGG : She 's fine , smiling like crazy . She 's fine , Doc . Yeah , we can take it from here . You 'll be here tomorrow ? All right , I 'll tell them . Bye-bye , Doc . Hey , kid , you gotta see this . You did it , Bogg . Well , I just brought in the hot water and towels , Mrs. Thomas delivered him . You know , this baby is gonna be head of the allied forces in World War II . President of the United States . Don 't tell Mr. Eisenhower that , he 's had enough excitement for one day . How is he ? Great . He 's just sitting in there staring at his wife with a big grin on his face . And he said to say thank you . JEFFREY : There 's one other person he should thank . Who 's that ? Alexander Graham Bell . Oh , yeah . Him and Mabel are probably gonna have a couple of these , huh ? Tell me something , Bogg . Would you really have given up being a voyager to stay with Mabel ? And miss a moment like this ? We 're voyagers , kid , and this is the only pay we get . JEFFREY ... If you wanna learn more about Alexander Graham Bell and his inventions or President Dwight David Eisenhower , take a voyage down to your public library . It 's all in books ! Help me , he 's going crazy ! Help me ! What do you want with Jack the Ripper ? I wanna capture him . You 're a reporter . I 'm Nellie Bly . Why don 't you become Sherlock Holmes and find Jack the Ripper ? I put an ad in the London Times daring him to meet me tonight . She 's meeting me . Winner take all ? No ! BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! ( CLOCK CHIMING ) ( DOOR OPENS ) ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) ( PLUMMETING ) You okay ? Where 'd he go ? Who ? The guy I fell on . I bounced off him , turned around , and he was gone . Just disappeared . JEFFREY : Hey , is she okay ? Looks like she fainted . I ... Maybe that guy that was here ... Where are we ? ( BEEPING ) November 19th , London , 1889 . I say , hello there ! Everything all right ? I think the lady here fainted . I think she was attacked or something . Attacked ? By whom ? Well , I really didn 't get a good look at him . We sort of dropped in and he just disappeared . Nonsense . He had to go somewhere . Here , hold that please . She 'll be all right . But I suggest we get her off the street . An American woman reporter has no business being in this neighborhood . How do you know she 's an American ? And a reporter ? The cloth of her coat , naturally . American coarse wool . My lamp , please . She 's obviously only a working woman , and her clothing is business-like and made for hard use . To be on this street at this time of night is not something a tourist would do . Rather , someone looking for a story . She carries a note pad and pencil , hence a reporter . Awesome . It 's elementary , really . ( MOANS ) I 've taken a flat in Baker Street . I suggest that we carry her there and see if we ... You 're not carrying me anywhere . You see ? An American . That 's one out of two . My dear young lady , as a doctor of medicine and a subject of the crown , I can tell you that you are in no condition to be wandering dark streets frequented by Jack the Ripper . Jack the Ripper ? Of course , Jack the Ripper . What do you think I 'm walking around here for , my health ? Where 's my gun ? BOGG : What do you want with Jack the Ripper ? I want to capture him . Find out who he is . Get his story . You 're a reporter . Two out of two , Bogg . My boy , it was elementary . I 'm Nellie Bly . So you 're that hotheaded headline grabber from New York . The one who risks her life to live through the situations on which she 's reporting . It 's the only way to get to the bottom of a story . I seriously doubt that . And while committing yourself to an insane asylum ... Or what was it ? Working in a vile New York sweat shop may seem romantic to you , I assure you , meeting Jack the Ripper would get you nothing but dead . I think that about does it here . We 've had enough excitement for tonight . Let us take the young lady back to my flat . Oh , I 'm not about ... You 're still a bit woozy , Miss Bly . Who are you ? Dr. Arthur Conan Doyle , and I can help you if you 'll let me . It 's just a few streets from here . Shall we ? JEFFREY : 221-B Baker Street . This is great ! This is just how I pictured it whenever I read Sherlock Holmes ' adventures . His adventure . Singular . I haven 't been able to write for a year . It would seem A Study in Scarlet will be the great Sherlock Holmes ' first and last foray into the unknown . No , it can 't . Sherlock Holmes is my favorite mystery detective . Mine , too . Why do you think I come up to London and set up a flat like this ? For inspiration ? Of course , for inspiration . Personally , I can 't stand the clutter . I had hoped that by living like Holmes , I might be able to break this damnable writer 's block and write him . Hasn 't helped , huh ? On the contrary , it 's worked beautifully . It has proven without a doubt that I should give up writing and concentrate on what I do best . Practicing medicine . Phineas Bogg ? You must be joking . Why would I do that ? Oh , come on . You know darn well that I 'm trying to break Phileas Fogg 's record of around the world in 80 days . It 's being carried by all the papers . Phileas Fogg ? Character in the book by Jules Verne . BOGG : Jules Verne ? He traveled around the world in 80 days . The French guy ? I met him once . Pulled him out of a brawl in Montmartre . I doubt that . He 's over 60 years old . Hey , Bogg , do you think he named the guy after ... I guess he had to . Anyway , I 'm not getting anywhere in this bed , so if you gents will excuse me ... There now , Miss Bly , drink this and try and lie back quietly for a few moments . Impossible , of course . You 've plenty of time to catch your boat or hot air balloon or whatever it is you 're traveling in . Boat . It leaves at midnight , but I 'm not going to be on it . It doesn 't matter anymore . It was just a stunt for some worldwide attention . I 'm glad you admit it . Look , I 'm the best reporter in my country , but over here , most of the papers won 't even run my stories . Maybe it 's my pride . I need to feel appreciated . I don 't know . But I 've always wanted something that would make the foreign press stand up and take notice . And now I 've got it . And it 's not just a stunt , but something that could do people some good . And I 've got to get back out on that street to do it . Why ? So you can meet up with Jack the Ripper again ? Of course . That was my plan . I was trying to get him to attack me . Now I 've heard everything . Perhaps her condition is worse than I thought . It may be funny to you , but I succeeded tonight in doing what Scotland Yard and London 's finest couldn 't . Narrowly escaping murder ? Luring the Ripper out of hiding . Six murders in six months and then nothing . He disappears . I should think that would be good riddance and we should leave it that . Fine , you leave it . But if you think I 'm going to pass up this story , you 're crazy . I 'm going to catch him . How ? By appealing to his pride , his conceit . As soon as I got here yesterday , I put an ad in the London Times daring him to meet me tonight at the scene of his crimes . Bravo . You succeeded . Wait a minute , Dr. Doyle , I think she 's onto something . Tell us all you remember . So you can steal my story ? No , so we can help you . You may be able to lure him out of hiding but you 're not going to be able to catch him alone . Well , I had just passed the Cock and Crown Pub , which I knew was the area where Ripper is believed to have spotted his victims . Big Ben . I remember hearing it strike 9 ... 00 . ( CLOCK CHIMING ) I turned this corner into a dark street . There was mist under the street lamps . The street looked empty , but I had this peculiar feeling I wasn 't alone . When I got about halfway , I thought I heard footsteps closing in behind me . I stopped , listened , no one was there . I started walking again . Have you ever entered a dark room and had the feeling you weren 't alone ? That someone , something was in there with you ? That 's the way I felt . I knew there was something behind me on that street . I wanted to scream but all I could do was go on . Then I heard them again , the footsteps . They were real and they were closing in . I stopped , pulled out the gun and turned . There was no one . I felt cold all over . I turned again and he grabbed me . I struggled and fainted . The next thing I remember is Mr. Bogg standing over me with you and the boy . Did you see the face of the man that attacked you ? No . All I saw was his black cape and some kind of shiny ... Watch with a ... DOYLE : A shiny watch with a what on it ? Nothing . There was nothing on it . ( SIGHING ) Dr. Doyle , would you mind terribly leaving the room ? I think I would like to rest . Of course . That 's the first sensible thing you 've said all night . Gentlemen ? You feel better , Nellie . We 'll help you catch that boat . NELLIE : Thanks . I 'll brew some tea while we wait . Great . Look , the way I see it , we got two problems . Jack the Ripper was never caught . After his sixth victim was found no one ever heard from him again , right ? JEFFREY : Right . Right . So we 've got to get Nellie to forget this Ripper stuff and complete the rest of her trip like she 's supposed to . JEFFREY : And Doyle 's got to break his writer 's block and get back to writing Sherlock Holmes . Yeah . Nellie ought to be a snap . All we gotta do is keep her up here until her boat leaves and stick her up . Doyle , now he 's gonna be trouble . Wrong , Bogg . What do you mean , " Wrong , Bogg " ? Doyle 's easy . He 's in the apartment . And where do you think Nellie is ? Looking for Jack the Ripper . That stupid girl 's gonna get herself killed . Do what you can with Doyle . I 'll be back as soon as I can . Nellie ! Nellie ! BOGG : Nellie ! Please , help me . Help , bobby . Bobby . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) MAN 1 : Looking for some company ? WOMAN : You 're in the wrong end of town , sweetie . Oh , alone she is now . Missy , what can I do for you this evening ? A bobby . I need a bobby . I 'm a bobby . Me too , ducky . MAN 2 : We 're all bobbies here , love . Even me , for a lady . ( ALL LAUGHING ) What do you want a bobby for ? You can read about it in the papers tomorrow . BARTENDER : Isn 't she the feisty one then ? Where I can find one ? Oh , right here . No , no , no , missy , it 's the truth . He always stops in here around 10 : 00 for a smoke and a pitch . He should be here in 10 minutes . Nellie ! Hi . Excuse me . Nellie , didn 't you hear me calling you ? Why 'd you duck out like that ? I said I wanted to help you . Well , if you really wanna to help me , you can buy me a cider . Are you kidding ? We 're not staying here . Yes , I am ! Hey , if the lady wants to stay she can stay . And she don 't need your company . The lady 's with me , all right ? ( MEN LAUGHING ) DOYLE : That girl ! In such a hurry . Didn 't even say goodbye . I wonder what her rush was . Off to get her story , I suppose . I can 't say I don 't envy her a bit . It would be wonderful to have the urge to pick up a pen . ( SIGHING ) All this inspiration and nothing in here . Had to have been something in there to create Sherlock . Oh , there was originally . But I 'll tell you , it 's almost as if he demanded to be written . Demanded ? During the process of creating him , the images came so hard and fast it was all I could do to get them down on paper . I began to feel he was almost impatient with my slowness . " Come on , " he seemed to be saying . " I 've got things to do . " There . Perhaps that 's my problem . I 'm talking about Holmes as if he were a living , breathing person . He always has been for me . Me , too , I 'm afraid . It 's as if I 've created a character more intelligent and alive than myself . I 'll tell you , he terrifies me . He scares you ? Intimidates is more the word . Yes . He intimidates me terribly . But that 's silly . I mean , he came from your mind . You created him . But every time I try to write , I feel him breathing down my neck . I end up thinking , " Sherlock , what would you say ? " Sherlock , is this too easy for you ? " Sherlock , is that case worthy ? " But you are Sherlock . I mean , he is a part of you . Look , I saw you collecting clues tonight at the scene after Nellie was attacked . Isn 't that something Sherlock would do ? I suppose . We do both have a curious nature . You have a curious nature . You gave it to him . I try to believe that , but he just overwhelms me . Then let him . What ? Let him overwhelm you . I mean , we 've got a perfectly good case right here in front of us . Worthy of him . Why don 't we bring the Sherlock out in you ? Why don 't you become Sherlock Holmes and find Jack the Ripper ? Look , Nellie , what if I told you I knew for sure you 'll never find the Ripper ? I 'd say you were lying . In fact , he could be in this pub right now for all we know . That 's a pretty good reason for us to get out of here , don 't you think ? No . That 's exactly why I have to stay . Of course . DRAKE ... The evidence that I produced proves that Phineas Bogg has purposely disobeyed all rules and regulations of the voyager code . BOGG ... Your evidence isn 't true , Drake . He 's the kind of voyager that weakens our ranks and is guilty as charged . Look , Drake ... Drake , that 's just one more lie . Voyager Drake has managed to make a career out of it . I do hope defense council understands that she will be held responsible for these accusations . I 'll be proud to . JUDGE : These pages are a record of the prosecution 's habit of falsely filing documents and tampering with the Omni memory recorder in order to convict innocent voyagers . Why , Drake ? Why ? Because it had to be done for the cause . The only cause you ever served was your own . And why would you be foolish enough to keep this incriminating evidence ? One day those words will vindicate me and all the work that I 've tried to do . The future shall judge me as a hero . Until then , you 'll deal with the judgments of this tribunal , and they shall be harsh . This court has no hold on me . Bailiff , stop that man . Hey , wait a minute , you 're not going anywhere . Stop him . DOYLE : I say , Watson , this is interesting . Come , have a look . What do you see ? JEFFREY : Dirt . Dirt now , previously mud . To be precise , clay-based mud . The type found on the threshold of the Cock and Crown where the pavement 's been torn up . Is that where you got it ? Why would I do that ? I scraped it from the footprints found at the scene of the crime . It means our man left the Cock and Crown just before attacking Miss Bly . But how can you be sure that the footprints were his ? There were no prints other than the victim 's , yours and Mr. Bogg 's . The fact that the attacker 's prints only lead to the crime and Mr. Bogg 's only lead away from it , I have not yet been able to deduce . When you came upon Miss Bly , did you notice anything ? Not really . It was pretty dark . Pity . Also extraordinary were the samples found from both yours and Mr. Bogg 's prints . Yeah ? Why ? Sand . Sand totally alien to England , to this part of the globe . Yes , I 'd place it somewhere in the northeastern segment of the Sahara . I 'm afraid it 's got me stumped . Well , he ... No , no , no , don 't tell me . I 'll get it eventually . I doubt it . What about this ? Oh , careful , dear Watson , careful . One must be careful with the evidence . Obliterating even the tiniest impression could destroy vital information . Fascinating , eh , Watson ? Fascinating . A gentleman , by the look of this . And one who carries a very sharp knife . You got that from this ? It 's quite elementary . Here , look again . See this indentation ? Mmm-hmm . It 's from a holder further augmented by the fact there are no teeth impressions . The affectation of a gentleman , perhaps a bit of a fop . Notice the clean slice . It was nipped with a well-honed blade . Not a penknife . No , something fine , a professional instrument . A scalpel , maybe . The doctor in you , Watson . So it 's all falling into place , then . Our gentleman took Miss Bly up on her challenge , had a leisurely smoke at the Cock and Crown , and once she passed the pub , left in pursuit . A cold-blooded man I 'd say , continued to smoke during the attempt on the young girl 's life . Fantastic . Elementary , Watson . And now for a closer look at those odd shoes of yours . ( CLOCK CHIMING ) Now , I better move on . It 's been over 20 minutes . That 's 20 minutes too long . Now let 's get out of here ... You said he 'd be here in 10 . Oh , it ain 't my fault , missy . Who 'd be here ? Sometimes when he 's running behind he passes us by . Moves on up to the Boar 's Head on Bleecker . Now who 's he talking about , Nellie ? You meeting somebody here ? That 's right , mate . She 's meeting me . Watch it , Alf . He 's a big one . For one . But not for all of us . I 've a feeling we shouldn 't have stopped for cider . Winner take all ? MAN : Get him , boys ! BOGG : Nellie ! Police ! Bobby ! MAN : Someone calling ? NELLIE : Help me , please ! He 's in the pub , hurry . Who is , miss ? Hold it right there , gents ! Great timing , Nellie . All right , miss . Which one is he ? There ! That one . The one in the middle . That man is Jack the Ripper . All right . Get him out . We 'll be going upstairs with the bloke . I say , Watson , the deeper I delve , the more baffling these shoes become . Why , this is a piece of quartz . The variety of which , I believe , is found only in the most remote reaches of the South American jungle . A sequoia pine needle . My boy , you do get around ! How ? Well , you see ... No , no , no , don 't tell me , don 't tell me . I 'll get it . I 'II ... ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) OFFICER : Open up . Scotland Yard . Bogg . I say , what 's going on here ? This young lady here accuses this gentleman of being Jack the Ripper . What ? Can you believe this ? Nellie , I was just ... Don 't play innocent . You attacked me once tonight . And when I left this apartment you followed me to the Cock and Crown to finish me off . I was trying to help you . To my grave . You were afraid I 'd turn you in and I have . Nellie Bly has taken Jack the Ripper off the streets for good . Oh , boy . Inspector Lestrod , Miss Bly here tells me you two gentlemen were at the scene of the crime and might be able to provide some corroborative evidence . And he was very anxious to see you . That 's because he 's innocent . The boy is right , Inspector . This is not your man . And may I ask your name , sir ? Doyle . Dr. Arthur Conan Doyle . Doyle ? He 's a writer . He wrote A Study ... A Study in Scarlet . Yes , I know that book . That made Scotland Yard look like a bunch of ninnies . Which is precisely the way they will look if you insist on convincing an innocent man . Well , since the facts prove his guilt , you must be basing your judgment solely on appearances . I am . Well , appearances can be deceptive . On the contrary . It is often the observation of the outside which provides the solution . For example , Inspector , I see by your hat that you are a bachelor , your parents are alive , that your mother is a generous woman and your father is a wealthy self-made man . Am I accurate ? Completely . All right , how did you do that ? Elementary , really . Your hat has a fine layer of dust on it . House dust . Of the type that a wife would routinely brush off for her husband . A bachelor . The hat is also of a quality far above the rest of your clothing . Why ? Watson ? It 's a gift . Must be a gift . Very good . From whom ? Only someone 's mom would give him a hat . Christmas . So impractical , mum . ( CHUCKLING ) Hey , Watson , not bad . All right , then , all right . Just get on . Tell us , how do you know my parents are still alive ? And that my father was a wealthy , self-made man ? Simple matter of deduction , my good man . Were your parents dead , you would have inherited some of that wealth which was able to afford a hat like that . The rest of your attire would be of equal quality . That your father is a self-made man is obvious . There are only two reasons for a man to withhold his wealth from his son . Watson ? One reason is they didn 't like him . But I don 't think that 's it . Because if they didn 't like him , they wouldn 't have given him the hat . Correct . Which leads us to the final reason and deduction that Inspector Lestrod 's father believes hard work is the only way to wealth . The way he acquired his . Bravo , Doctor , bravo . Very amusing . But then we 're not here to try me , are we ? No . We came here for Jack the Ripper . Well , don 't look at me . I 'd like to get to the bottom of this , too . And we shall . Inspector , allow me to present the evidence which shows Mr. Bogg 's innocence . Watson , the cigar . There you go . Thank you . This was found at the scene of the crime . The people I came upon didn 't smoke . Well , Miss Bly doesn 't smoke and young Jeffrey doesn 't smoke , but he could . But he doesn 't . ( SNIFFING ) Smoke free . ( SNIFFING ) No nicotine stains on the hands and smile , Mr. Bogg . Clean , white teeth . This man does not smoke . The cigar could 've been dropped earlier this evening by someone else . I doubt it . The cigar was still smoking . The dampness of the street would have doused a cigar very quickly . No . I believe it was held by Miss Bly 's attacker . Let us see if we can prove this further . Mr. Bogg , Miss Bly . What is it ? We are going to reenact the attack . Wonderful . Your gun , Miss Bly . Here Mr. Bogg , hold this . Now , Miss Bly , how close was your attacker when you turned around with your gun ? Just a few feet away . He was practically on top of me . Oh , come on , will you give Doyle and me a chance ? When she turns around , grab her . Place one hand on the gun , the other on her neck . That correct , Miss Bly ? That 's right . He took the gun away . Very well , my dear , you may begin . Hold it ! NELLIE : What does this prove ? If he 's doing what I think he is doing it could prove the attacker was smoking that cigar . I understand why you want the Ripper but I can 't understand why you want it to be me . Come here , Inspector . There ! A burn . Where the ember knocked the sleeve . I see that . So ? It 's just been made . Would you remove your hand , please , Mr. Bogg ? BOGG : But that mark wasn 't . It was made earlier this evening by Miss Bly 's attacker . A smoker and someone four inches shorter than Mr. Bogg . That man is also in possession of Miss Bly 's pistol . If you search Mr. Bogg , Inspector , I will assure you , you will find not a thing . Admit it , Nellie , you were wrong about me . One cigar burn doesn 't prove you 're innocent . You could have dropped the gun anywhere . And what about the other evidence ? What about that thing on your belt ? BOGG : This ? She saw that on her attacker , Mr. Bogg . Can I see it ? Please be careful with it , would you ? It 's my grandfather 's . The V. I saw a flash of silver and that V. And then I fainted . INSPECTOR : V ? Like you saw on this one ? Yes . And the cape . The attacker wore a cape just like his . Wait a minute , this cape is not mine . Look , the clasp broke when I grabbed him . Could be , Mr. Bogg . But can you tell me why there was only one set of footprints leading to the crime and then again just one set leaving ? And can you explain how you just appeared , and how your attacker just disappeared ? Doctor ? I 'm afraid the only person with that answer is Mr. Bogg . What if I told you that device can make you appear and disappear ? It sounds mad , but it would explain it . It is mad . Utter nonsense . Take him to the Yard . JEFFREY : No , you can 't , he 's not the Ripper . And you , son , I 'd like you to come along with me . I think I 'd like to question you some more . No ! He 's innocent . No . WOMAN : They say it 's Jack the Ripper . That 's right . He 's in there . I heard one of the bobbies say it . The gallows is too good for him . Well , I 'd like to see him swing . Yes ! String him up ! String him up ! String him up ! Hang him ! To the graveyard with him ! Don 't worry , Watson . I 'll think of something . Right . Give it that old Sherlock try . LESTROD : Come on , son , get inside . Tomorrow morning the papers will proclaim , " The Streets Are Safe Again . " How can you be so sure ? I thought we just proved that . What we proved was that most of your evidence was circumstantial . I couldn 't explain one or two things . Pretty big things . You know , I remember reading about you , Nellie Bly . About how you exposed the terrible treatment of the mentally ill , and about your stories ending the awful abuse of the kids working in the factory sweat shops . Wait a minute . The thing that impressed me most about you , the thing I really , really respected was how you got to the bottom of your stories . How you dug your facts up . How you 'd go to any length to expose the truth . Now that Nellie Bly was a good reporter . A great reporter . I admired her . And this Nellie Bly ? This one 's stunting . Going for the obvious , for what 's fast and easy . For what 'll grab the headlines , huh ? She says she 's out to serve the public , but she 's really just out to serve herself . And I really am sorry . Oh , I 'm not Jack the Ripper , Nellie . But he 's out there . You ought to be more careful . Take care of her , Doc . ( CROWD CLAMORING ) Straight to the Yard . ( CLOCK CHIMING ) Well , Miss Bly , it 's a quarter past eleven . In one night you 've done what Scotland Yard and the entire London police force couldn 't accomplish in a year . You captured Jack the Ripper . Have I ? Or was it just a stunt ? Well , you seem to have convinced Inspector Lestrod . Your boat leaves in 45 minutes . Shall I escort you ? Yes . But not to my boat . Then where ? To the Cock and Crown . ( MAN YELLING ) I don 't understand it . How could she have seen the Omni before she passed out ? DRAKE ... Phineas Bogg . It 's been a long time since we met last . BOGG ... I could 've gone a few more centuries without seeing you , Drake . A lot has changed around here . Yeah . It looks like a new Omni . Model 3-1650 , silver case , open-time calibration , state-of-the-art . JEFFREY : Bogg ? Bogg ? You okay , Bogg ? Another Omni . What ? The guy I landed on just disappeared into thin air , right ? Yeah . What if he used an Omni ? But Nellie said she saw a flash of silver . That 's right . And the only person I know that has a silver Omni ... Is Drake . DRIVER : Get up there ! Go on ! DOYLE : We 'd better hurry , Nellie . Bogg is right . These streets are particularly dangerous for you and me . DRIVER : Hurry up , get on now ! What 's Drake doing here ? You don 't think he could be the Ripper ? No , that 's not his style . But fouling up history for revenge is . So that 's why he 's after Nellie . To make sure she wouldn 't complete her trip . Yeah , and he wound up with me as a bonus . And if I got to Nellie like I think I did , she 's on her way to the Cock and Crown . Start screaming . What ? I gotta get to Drake before he gets to Nellie . Start screaming like I 'm beating you or something . Help ! Help me , he 's going crazy ! Help me ! Louder , keep it up ! JEFFREY : Ow ! He 's hitting me , help me ! Whoa . Inspector , Inspector , the boy 's yelling his head off in there . What the devil 's going on ? All right , son ! Well , open it ! JEFFREY : Help me , he 's hurting me , help ! Go , Bogg ! Go after him ! ( WHISTLE BLOWING ) Get after him ! Yes , sir . MAN : Hurry up now . Hurry up ! Come on ! I have that feeling again . Someone 's behind us . DOYLE : There 's no one there . No , stop . I could have sworn . No , you 're right . There is someone back there . Hurry , Nellie , run ! Hurry , Nellie , up to your left . DOYLE : There he is . I see him ! Here . Up here . Nellie ! Nellie ! Wrong alley , Miss Bly , Dr. Doyle . This one 's a dead end . Come out , Miss Bly . I 'm only trying to return your gun . Don 't you believe me ? He 's up there , off to the right ! DRAKE : You know , Miss Bly , I can 't believe my luck . Nellie Bly , Arthur Conan Doyle and Phineas Bogg . Three birds with one stone . Now don 't misunderstand me . I 'm not your Jack the Ripper . My life is dedicated to ruining history , not people . You , Miss Bly , were just a piece of history to obliterate . Nellie ! But when my friend Bogg showed up , the stakes changed . There you are . Now where is the good doctor ? Here ! NELLIE : No ! Don 't ! Help ! Someone help ! Now , you get your gun . No ! Oh , no , Bogg . It 's not that easy . ( WHISTLE BLOWING ) Hold it there ! That 's quite enough , Mr. Bogg ! Thought you 'd come back and finish Nellie off , did you ? Bogg ! On the contrary , Inspector , Mr. Bogg saved Miss Bly . Is that true ? Yes . Yes , it is . But there 's only you and Doyle in this alley . Who did he save you from ? From the man who attacked me earlier tonight . The one I mistook for Mr. Bogg . Well , where is he ? I can only report what I saw , Inspector . And what I saw was a man who disappeared . DOYLE : There ! I 've got it ! Sahara sand , South American quartz , sequoia needle . There 's only one way you could have picked up all these on this shoe . How ? A visit to the Royal Zoological Gardens . Correct , Watson ? You amaze me , Sherlock . Forget , Sherlock . That came out of Doyle 's head . That pipe-smoking aristocrat 's never going to get the best of me again . For the last time , Nellie , the answer is no . A short interview is all I 'm asking . Now , I saw that man touch his device and disappear . You 've got one , that means you can disappear . Nellie , there you go telling stories again . Have you ever seen me disappear ? Who are you ? What do you do ? Look , Lestrod was able to delay your boat an hour . If you don 't leave now , you could blow the whole record . You 're not going to tell me , are you ? No . After all we 've been through , you 'd deny me an exclusive ? Absolutely . Then can I do one thing ? That depends . That you can do . Thanks for keeping me in line . Ambition 's fine , as long as it doesn 't get in the way of reporting . Hear , hear . Thank you , Doctor . Jeffrey . Bon voyage , Nellie . Say hi to Jules for me . Dr. Doyle , can I make you some tea ? ( DINGS ) Maybe help you out with some of the Watson stuff ? Hey , come back in a month or so . You can be the first to read it . Forget it . Huh ? I already have . JEFFREY ... If you wanna learn more about Arthur Conan Doyle or the Sherlock Holmes stories , Nellie Bly or Jack the Ripper , take a voyage down to your public library .

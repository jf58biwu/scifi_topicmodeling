 Good evening . I 'm Howard K. Smith with the state of the war . In the Middle East , a dramatic breakthrough ... as the occupied city of Jerusalem saw a combined force ... of Arab and Israeli commandoes briefly liberate the Wailing Wall ... before being driven back by counter-attacking Visitor troops . Closer to home , news from Los Angeles , California ... where strongman Nathan Bates has solidified his position ... in creating what is being called an " Open City " ... similar to Lisbon during World War II ... Los Angeles has agreed to a separate peace . The Resistance has denounced this peace as a sham . From this vantage point , Los Angeles ' future ... remains in doubt . This week , the Freedom Network awards the medal of valor ... to 18-year-old Kipper Cordisco of Cleveland , Ohio . He organized members of his senior class into the George Washington Brigade ... and led them into action at Bear 's Point , Kentucky . They routed an alien patrol ... while heavy fighting continued in the Appalachian Mountains . And that 's where we stand tonight . From the Freedom Network in New York ... our hopes are with you . Good night . You can stop shaking now , Gooder . Very funny . They 're everywhere . We 're on their turf . What did you expect ? What 's going to happen to all these people ? Why don 't you ask them ? How far is your kid 's school ? It 's two and a half miles outside of town . I 'm ready when you are . Let 's hit it . Stop it ! - Stop that kid ! - Get back here ! Halt , or I 'll fire ! - Come on , get back here ! - Get over here , you ! Gooder ! Halt ! Stop or I 'll shoot ! You 're under arrest ! You there , check over there ! Try around this way . Move out ! Thanks . How 's it look ? We 're clear . Get out of here . Both of you . Now ! Mom , it 's okay . Annie , please . If they find you here , they 'll kill us all . - Lady ... - Please , go before it 's too late . No . They 're not going anywhere . Not until it 's safe . Are you hungry ? I 'll fix you something to eat . Mom , it 's gonna be all right . Is your mom gonna be okay ? Yeah . She 's just a little paranoid . Why should she be different than anyone else ? You 're not from around here , are you ? You 're pretty sharp . This is a small town . Everybody knows everybody . We 're from Los Angeles . Why would you leave there to come someplace where they eat you ? Good question . We 're looking for my son . He 's at the State Academy . What 's wrong ? They took all the boys from the Academy . Took them where ? I don 't know . Nobody knows . They just disappeared . - Any word on Robin ? - Nothing . There 's no way of knowing if she 's even in the city . Like in the story . The poor little lamb has lost her way . At least she 's got us . I 've been meaning to talk to you about that . How much longer you planning to stash her here ? Elias . Willie takes care of her when I 'm not here . Yes , I 'm her guardian angle . You 're supposed to be my bartender . Look , Elias , I 'm sorry that you 're being inconvenienced ... but I just don 't have the answers right now , okay ? I mean , look what 's happened . A week ago everything was normal . Elizabeth was a sweet , innocent little girl . Now Robert is dead . Her mother 's missing . And that sweet little girl is turning into a woman . A very special woman ... whom Diana would love to get her hands on . Looks like the coast is clear . Thanks . Any time . Hang in there . You 've always got to play the hero . Was I supposed to let her get zapped ? We didn 't come to save the world . We came to get Sean . Freeze ! Hold it right there . Don 't move . Easy . - One move and we 'll shoot . - Get the guns . All right , let 's go . - Call the Mother Ship . - Yes , sir . You betrayed them . We can 't fight them , Annie . Don 't you understand ? All we can do is try to survive . This war is far from over . Why do you think I 'd be foolish enough ... to hand that child over to you ? Not to me , Nathan . To her family . For a few minutes . All they want to do is see Elizabeth . I 'm sorry , Diana . Nathan , imagine how you would feel if you never got to see your family again . After all , Elizabeth 's father was one of us . Your son , Kyle , is such a handsome young man . All I 'm trying to do is bring a family together . I didn 't realize you had a sentimental side . Sentiment is often perceived as weakness . Do we have an agreement ? I 'll think about it . Good day , Diana . Roller . I want her . Sir , we 're doing everything we can . I don 't want any more excuses . I want that girl . Right . Not many guards . No fence . It 's just a sand moat . New blood . The more the merrier . Out . That thing hurts . I 'm Col. Hoya , gentlemen . Welcome to your final destination . Building One . Get me a bed with a view . Don 't you want to check out the accommodations ? I 'll mingle . Make some new friends . That should be no problem with your charm . You realize you 'll never see your daughter again . Don 't say that . Leave me alone . I 'll bet she 's a beautiful child . Looks just like you , doesn 't she ? Or does she look like her father ? No . I guess it doesn 't really matter , does it ? Our destiny has already been determined . You don 't know that for sure . Tell that to Shelly Connell . They took her out last night and she never came back . I wonder if that wire 's hot . I am a mess . Is it always fun and games around here ? You got something against having a few laughs ? That 's not what I meant , ace . Ever think about busting out of this place ? All the time . Why don 't you do something about it ? Why don 't you ? The important thing is not to give up hope , Isaac . We 're going to get out of here somehow . There 's only one way out . No , Isaac ! That 's suicide . - How are you doing ? - I 'm okay . What are you doing here ? Have you seen my dad ? Is Elizabeth all right ? She 's fine . She 's doing just fine . What 's the story here ? This is a prison camp . Doesn 't anybody want to escape ? That answer your question ? News from the front ? Our troops have entered Marseilles , Jerusalem , and Ho Chi Minh City . What about Houston ? Houston is still under siege ... meeting stiff resistance from the World Liberation Front . Patience , Lydia . You keep saying that , Diana . Our Leader is asking for results . Do you have the additional background information on Kyle Bates ? I wish I shared your understanding of how this pertains to the war effort . The only way Nathan Bates will give us the Starchild ... is if we offer him something more valuable . I 'm not certain that his son falls into that category . Nathan and Kyle live apart ... rarely speak , and haven 't seen one another ... since last year when Kyle was expelled from Stanford University . Since then , the younger Bates has spent his time racing motorcycles ... mostly in Arizona and Nevada . That certainly suggests he could be trapped behind our lines . He could even be in one of our internment centers . What this suggests , Diana ... is that your strategy is based on nothing but speculation and wishful thinking . Is that so ? When I want your opinion on strategy ... I 'll tell you . Got some more help for you . Now , pick up the pace . We need this foundation laid before noon . You 're still with us , huh ? I thought you 'd be long gone by now . Like your ex-friend ? In case you hadn 't heard , the lizards call them crivits . Once you hit the sand , you haven 't got a prayer . You heard the man ! We need cement . I 'm sorry about your father . He died a hero . I know , Mike . The thing that terrifies me is what 's going to happen to Elizabeth . I should never have left her . How could I be so stupid ? Feeling guilty is not going to change anything . She 's a baby . She needs her mother . Robin , she 's not a baby anymore . - She 's ... - You 've got to get us out , Mike . I know . I 'm working on it . Mr. Bates , I don 't know what to say . How about yes ? No one 's more qualified to head the project than you , Julie . You really know how to drop a bombshell . Julie , negotiating for Los Angeles to be an Open City ... was not an unconditional surrender . It was a classic stall . A bid for time . Time to develop an infallible means of driving the Visitors from the planet . We 're going to develop the new red dust right here ... with the utmost secrecy and the greatest possible speed . I need someone I can trust . Please , think it over . I don 't need to . You 've got your girl . Excellent . Normally , this would be cause for celebration . Unfortunately , we must get right to work . Where do we begin ? With the Starchild . Her genetic makeup may well hold the key for developing an effective antidote . You knew her family . I 'm counting on you to help us find her . I 'll certainly do what I can . Enjoy your meal . That 's what I love about this place . You never know who 'll you see . - I wonder what they 'll order ? - Hopefully , not one of us . Dr. Parrish , how nice to see you . I don 't want to hear you complain about business , Elias . It has picked up since I started letting in the lizards . - A stroke of genius . - Thank you very much . How do you like my new piano player ? What piano player ? She was here a minute ago . Have you seen Elizabeth ? You had her playing piano right out in the open ? She was dynamite . Hey , will you relax ? How 's anybody gonna figure out who she is ? Willie did . I 'm going out this way . How do you know they went through the front door ? Nice dog . I get the feeling this isn 't your usual line of work . Don 't worry , you 'll pick it up just like that . I 'm going to need a diversion . What 's the matter , old man ? Getting tired ? Come on , get up . Look out , Bates . He 's mine . I used to work for a man named Nathan Bates . Yeah . So ? You remind me of him . And I don 't like him . Animals ! I will not tolerate violence in my camp . Take them away . Let 's go . Both of you . Hey , easy with that . Come with me . Work detail . Why 's he so lucky ? I 'm a lucky guy . Way to go . We 're gonna get you home , tiger . Having fun ? What did they do to you ? Tried to turn me into a burrito . How 's your plan going ? Pack your bags . We go tonight . You 'll never guess who just showed up . Bring him out . Hello , Kyle . I 'm a friend of your father 's . - Who is it ? - It 's your son , Kyle . Put him through . How 's it going , Dad ? I hear you 're a big man these days . Kyle , where are you ? Are you all right ? Of course , he 's all right , Nathan . Aren 't you , Kyle ? Absolutely . I 've never been in such stimulating company . If you had accepted my first offer , Nathan ... none of this would have happened . I 'll be at your office tomorrow at noon . Either you have the Starchild , or I 'll have Kyle . Wait , Diana . Roller , I 've changed my mind . You might be onto something . I 'll make arrangements with the police . Right , sir . She 's coming around ? Sweetheart , I know you 're scared . We all are . But we 're in this together , you and me . Even Elias and Willy . Welcome back to Planet Earth , kid . Maybe you better stay off your feet . I 'm fine . I would like some water , though . Sure . Coming right up . Elias , can you bring me something stronger ? You got it . Go in the kitchen . Bring everybody out . I tried to stop them , boss . - Buy you a drink ? - No , I never touch the stuff . - Perhaps a late supper . - No . Look , dude , what the hell do you want ? Got a tip that this joint 's a hotbed for underground activity . Know anything about that ? So we 're going to search this place from top to bottom . Come on . Let 's go to my place . Okay , tough guy , go for it . Move it . When the lizard queen polishes off Bates ... she 'll be back for dessert . You better make your first choice the right one . You better stay clear . This could get hot . All right . Now stay out of the crivit patch and we 're home free . Watch me . Come on , baby . Here goes nothing . All right . Send one up . We 're going home . That 's a girl . Watch your hands . To slow down , just squeeze . Come on . It 's going to be okay . Ready ? Hold on . Go for it . Come on , next ! Lt 'd be such a pity if I had to kill you . Maybe I can figure out a reason for you to keep me alive . It would have to be a very compelling one . Why don 't we sit down and talk about it ? Don 't be shy . Guard ! Go on , take off . Go on ! On my back , quick . Stop them ! Diana , I assure you , every prisoner will be found . Shut up , you incompetent fool ! Mike ! Nathan . Just a minute . Nathan . What a surprise . Julie , may I come in ? I 'm not really prepared for company . I 'll only be a minute . I 've made a terrible mistake . I thought if Diana believed I had the Starchild ... she 'd give up her search for her . I 'm afraid Diana called my bluff . I don 't follow you . She has my son , Kyle . If I don 't give her Elizabeth , my son will die . I know you were once with the Resistance . I promise up front there will be no reprisals . I just want my son alive . Isn 't there someone you can contact ? Hello . Nathan , I 'd like you to meet my cousin Betty . She just arrived from Tucson . It 's very bad there . Yes , I know . Julie , if you get any information ... anything at all ... I 'll be in your debt . I hope you get your son back , Mr. Bates . Thank you . Aren 't you even gonna tell me your name ? You miss your mom and dad , don 't you ? I 'll bet they miss you . No sign of Robin , or any lizards . Time to move on . I 'm not going back to Los Angeles . - Gooder . - Not yet , anyway . Somebody 's got to know where Sean was taken . Listen to me . We 've got to go back . Maybe Julie can find out something through Bates . What about the kid ? He goes with us . Nice try . Tyler . What if we don 't make it ? Somebody 's got to take him . I 'll take him . You 've come a long way from your little town . Yeah . I used to baby-sit for him . Didn 't I , Billy ? He always been like that ? Ever since they took away his parents . What will you do with him ? I found a camp up in the mountains , where the red dust still works . Lots of Billy 's friends and neighbors are already up there . You 're welcome to join us . Maybe some other time . I understand . See you , kiddo . You two take it easy . Gooder . Any final thoughts ? - Do you really want to hear it ? - No . Don 't screw up . Hey ! You over there ! The fence ! Move out ! Hold it ! Stop ! Freeze ! Full alert ! Don 't let them get away ! Take a seat , Tyler , we 're going flying . They 've just stolen a flyer . - Can you take them alive ? - Negative . I 'm the only fighter in the area . Then destroy them . I 'll intercept them and blow them out of the sky . You can quit shaking now , Tyler . Nice work . You 're improving , Gooder . Better luck next time . Kyle . I had to see it with my own eyes . The Emperor of Los Angeles . She let you go ? Diana doesn 't let anyone go . You should know that . I escaped . It 's good to have you back . Where are you going ? What did I tell you ? Everybody 's looking for a little girl . She 's the best-kept secret in town . How long can that last ? I 've been thinking about that . She can stay as long as she likes . I don 't know how safe that is after last night . They searched the place till daybreak ... and they couldn 't even find my secret recipe for Oysters Bienville . I 'm gonna go check on her . What happened ? It 's a long story . I got time . Nice place you got here . Look what the cat dragged in . What can I get you ? Anything that 's on the house . English

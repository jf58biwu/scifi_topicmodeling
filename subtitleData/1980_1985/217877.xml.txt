I can 't be too late . I 'm meeting a girl at nine . We want to celebrate too . You 've got stamina . Partying after the graveyard shift . Partying is not working . It 's fun . Something 's wrong . Looks like the Indians 've got another one . Car 17 to Dispatch . We 've got stripped truck at Sector H. We 'll be right back to you . This is one hell of a mess .

Get the hell out of here . Give me the keys . Where 's the boat ? Right over there . Billy , get out of that thing . He killed Michael , Captain . I 'm ordering you . Billy , come back . He won 't give up ! Aviation 19 . This is officer 1412 ... Speak up , officer 1412 . I 'm now following a suspect . I 'm in the speed boat below you . Can you come up over me ? Roger , officer 1412 . Come in closer and drop me a line . 1 , 2 , 3 , up ! What the hell ! You deliberately disobeyed a direct order . That man killed my partner . It doesn 't matter what happen . No excuse to blow up the harbor . Captain , listen . Shut up . I don 't like a cop getting killed . But we 're not in the revenge business . The mayor 's really mad over this one . He wants you shield . I had no choice . You 'd have let the harbor police take over . But you had to be the big hero . You 're back to crowd control . But . No buts ! That 's final ! Maybe next time you 'll think twice . Get out ! Billy . We 're with you . Thanks . Nice suit , Garoni . I 'm supposed to blend it with the crowd . I heard about your firework display . You have a flair for the dramatics . You 're well informed . I have to be , I 'm your new partner . How did you pull this detail ? The usual . Same old story . Tell me . I put a robber in hospital . And he screamed police brutality . Of course . So did the newspapers . All the way to the commissioner 's office . The usual . Don 't tell me , you guys are cops . Are we that obvious ? You are not so bad . He sticks out like a sore thumb . Are you guys allowed to drink ? Can I get you a beer ? No thanks . But I can buy you one later . I might take you up on that . Excuse me , I have to mingle . That 's Laura Shapiro . Listen up you boy . If you keep bugging Miss Shapiro . I 'll scrape you off the floor . With a putty knife . All the fashion are design by top designer this time . That 's Benny Garucci , a karate champion . He 's a tough bastard . Why does Shapiro need him here ? To protect Laura . He can afford to have the army standing by . He owns half of Manhattan . I wouldn 't mind teaching Garucci a lesson . Ladies and gentlemen . Laura Shapiro Marketing is pleased . To introduce Edmond Wong and his collections . To New York City . Nice dress . Nice chest . You can 't even protect a girl . They had machine guns . Weren 't you armed ? With just have a hand gun . We couldn 't shoot without hitting the girl . You did the right thing . Any words from Shapiro ? He has no idea why Laura was snatched . For the last 12 hours , we 've been monitoring his phone . No ransom demands , no orders . You might find this interesting . What is it ? Calls made in the last 12 hours by Garucci . Six calls to the same number . Country code 852 . Hong Kong . How did you get this ? A friend at the phone company . The blonde ? No , the redhead . How does Hong Kong come in ? Somebody might be able to answer that . He is just outside . Send in Mr. Cantrell . Bob Cantrell from the Justice Department . Are there the kidnappers ? How could we know ? They wore masks . What 's this all about ? They work for a Hong Kong crime boss Harold Ko . Harold Ko ! You know him ? Everybody who knows Hong Kong knows Ko . A real snake . A tough one the catch . We 've been suspecting Shapiro and Ko . Running drug from Hong Kong to New York . But we 've got no hard evidence . Why would Ko kidnap Shapiro 's daughter ? I 'm not sure . Maybe they 've had a falling out . There is a good possibility . That Laura is now in Hong Kong . That is impossible Nobody could smuggle a girl that quickly . Not for Ko . Ko 's got most of Hong Kong in his pocket . If Laura Shapiro 's in Hong Kong . We should check it out . Forget it , Billy . I know some informers over there . It might be worth a try . Garoni can come with me . He knows Hong Kong from his Nam days . You 're way out of line . I like it . If you find Laura and pin it on Ko . You might crack the Hong Kong connection . We 've got nothing to lose . Go as special advisors to the local police . See what you can find . Yes Sir ! See you Captain . Thanks , Captain . Here 's the jeep 's key . Sure you don 't want a driver ? No , we 're fine . Thanks for helping us through customs . Don 't mentioned it . Superintendent Whitehead will see you at 4 p.m. Sure . Let 's go . See you . Thanks a lot . You like if ? We could have stayed in a better place . We 're on expenses . Nostalgia , memories of R and R. I remember during Nam days . There 's nothing here except horny grunts . And the women , Billy , the women ! They 're out of this world . Besides , no one will find us here . What 's that ? A coin , my Chinatown friend gave it to me . It 's sort of a calling card . Oh yes ? You never know . Just an old coin . That anyone could smuggle a girl here . Without me knowing about it is impossible . Improbable , not impossible . That number you wanted to trace . Belongs to a Shanghai Massage Parlor . But I want you to assure me . You 'll behave with the most discretion . Discretion is my middle name . Show them out . Yes sir . This way please . Welcome . First time here ? Yes . We 're two lost souls from New York . A friend recommended this place highly . We have many friends in New York . Maybe you remember Benny Garucci . Yes Benny said , he really loves this place . He talks about it all the time . We have too many friends in New York . I can 't remember then all . But we can make your visit very exciting . Follow me please . Keep your eyes open . I wouldn 't miss this for the world . This guy makes me nervous . Watch him for me . Hey , Garoni . It 's cold . I want a solid massage . Drop it . No ! you drop it . What 's going on here ? Dress them , I want to talk to them . Before we kill them . Can 't even take a bath in peace . Why did Shapiro sent you ? Shapiro ? I think you know why he sent us . He 's very angry at you people . Shapiro 's angry at us ? Yes . But he 's the one who ... These men are New York cops . Cops ? I ain 't a cop , I 'm a tourist . Maybe he 's a cop . Take them out , kill them . Tell Harold Ko we 're in town . His days are numbered . It 's never wise to make threats . Especially ones you can 't keep . That 's not a threat . That 's a promise . Let him go . Let 's go . Billy . Now that we 've challenged Ko . What should we do next ? Tomorrow you check out Ko 's setups . I 'll see the coin 's owner . Mr. Ko , two New York cops came . Really ? I know what to do . Yes . Time for a rehearsal . Sure . Let me buy you dinner tonight . Ricky 's inviting me to a movie . I haven 't decided yet . Let 's go . So you 're coming with me tonight ? No , I just made a dinner date . Can you tell me ... No . Hurry . Is there a Miss May-fong Ho here ? May-fong Ho ? I don 't think so . Ready , one , two , three , four . Concentrate . Let 's take a break . What 's wrong , Sally ? I 'm not feeling well . Maybe you should go home . Can I talk to this lady ? Can 't you see she 's busy ? Tin Ho of New York sent me . I don 't know anyone it New York . Miss Ho . Move over please . Miss Ho . Don 't call me Miss Ho . I haven 't used that name for years . Is he bothering you ? Say yes and I 'll throw him out . Words , words , words . I 'll protect you , Sally . Come on . Let 's get him . Grab something . Come on . It 's a toy . Try it . I 'm a cop from New York . I need to talk to Sally . Excuse me . I 'm glad he 's a cop . Why ? Gives us an excuse to quit . My dad and another man . Were both partners of Ko . Then my dad died . How did that happen ? My mother wouldn 't tell me . Said I 'd better not know about it . I stopped using the name Ho . I wanted a new background . I shouldn 't have come then . If Tin Ho can trust you , So can l Go see Lee Hing . Who 's he ? Will he help me ? He was the other partner . Show him Tin Ho 's coin . I 've got to run now . My apology to your two friends . Tell Mr. Ko ... Why would Lee Hing help us ? He , Ko and Sally 's dad were partners . They had a fall out . Sally 's dad died , Lee Hing retired . Ko killed Sally 's dad ? Nobody could prove it . Get us to Lee Hing 's boat . Sure . What happened to your eye ? It 's swollen . Something bit me . You 'd better watch out . For Hong Kong mosquitoes wearing high heels . Greetings from a friend in New York . Who 's your friend ? Tin Ho . He 's an old and honorable friend . Mr. Hing . We 're ... You 're cops from New York . You want a girl who 's kidnapped by Ko . There are no secrets in Hong Kong . Sit and have some tea . That 's the least I can do . Seeing how you 've come for nothing . Soo Ling , tea for our guests . Why our trip for nothing ? Sure you can help us . Surely I could , but I well not . My father 's retired . Uncle Hing ! I have a charter . I need some supplies . On credit , I suppose . You 've got to tell us where the girl is . My daughter 's correct , I 'm retired . Sally told us all about you . Don 't you want to get Ko ? You ' re two strangers . I don 't know if I can trust you . I 'm not taking risks . When Ko found out we 're here . He 'd pin it on you anyway . Are these men bothering you ? They 're simply tired and frustrated . Forgive them . They 're dangerous , father . Make them leave before they bring trouble . I think they already have . they must have followed us . No . Freeze . Hurry . Hurry . Faster . Faster . Take me to Ko right now . Bye bye . You see the trouble you caused ! Why couldn 't you leave us alone ? Give me a break . Ko 's out of line , I 'll help you . You think it 's wise ? Maybe not . But sometimes . Honor is not wise . Can you find out where Laura is as soon as possible ? My friends should know . You have a picture of Laura ? Here . Leave it to me . Soo Ling will contact you . Thanks , Mr. Hing . Thanks . I hate failure . Give the two cops a last choice . Let them know I mean Business . Give me another chance . You 'll be demoted to pimping . I don 't want you around . Mr. Ko ... Who else have the cops seen ? Besides Lee Hing . I 've got a report . The daughter of old Ho . She hasn 't surfaced for years . So the Ho 's are back . I won 't tolerate them this time . What is this ? Who is this ? Take the money and leave Hong Kong at once . It 's not Ko 's money we want . It 's Laura Shapiro . I 'm sorry to hear that . Garoni . Take Ko is a sly fox . Get the window , I 'll take the stairs . Where 's Laura Shapiro ? Speak up . Freeze . Sit down . I spoke with you Captain again . He knew nothing about a machine gun . You can 't survive in Asia without one . You know what these are ? Estimates of the damages you caused . We know we 're getting close to Ko . Otherwise he wouldn 't have tried to kill us . You have evidence Ko 's behind the attack ? I think it 's pretty obvious . You know what kind of reputation Ko has ? Read the news , He spent $ 3 million purchasing a horse . He 's holding a press-conference . To announce that all of its race winnings . Will be donated to charity . The man 's a real peach . I 'm warning you two . I 've wired your commissioner to call you back to U.S.A. Next time I 'll put you in jail . Can we go now ? Go ! I don 't want to see you again . Benny ? David Ho ? Yes . Welcome to Hong Kong .

It will be running for the Derby . Ko ! You left your briefcase in our room . You are mistaken . If this isn 't your briefcase . Then this isn 't your money either . We can just sit back . Now even we stay in hotel , they 'll still come looking for us . I agree . David will take you to Laura . Thanks . After I 've seen Laura . The money will be wired in . If Shapiro had paid for the shipment . This affair wouldn 't have happened . It was a simple misunderstanding . But those two cops know too much now . If you don 't mind I will help . Come along tonight then . Lee . Wing . I 've checked this place out . We 've got to get Ko . My sources told me . The girl should be at the shipyard . Where in the shipyard ?

They know I 'm coming ? Take care of yourself . I will . Thanks . See you . Come on . Garucci came out of a container with two bouncer . I guess he was checking on the girl . Before arranging an exchange with Ko . A container doesn 't have much room . Not if they weld several together . There have been rumors . That the place is Ko 's drugs factory . Maybe we should call Whitehead . We 're not sure it 's a drug factory . We 're not sure if Laura 's there . If we 're wrong , Whitehead will ship us home . I 'll go with you . That 's a great idea . I can handle myself in a fight . Don 't worry , Soo Ling . I 'll go with them . You have experience in these things ? Yes , S.E.A.L.S. , U.S. Navy . I still have some old gears . What 's that ?

I 'm not releasing Laura to anyone . If you kill Garoni , she disappears . I 'm surprised . Your partner 's life means so much to you . I believe we can do business . Be at my shipyard in 2 hours . I 'll be there . Stan will take you Whitehead . He 'll take you home . I don 't mind staying in hiding . Till you get Garoni back . It 's okay . Get Laura to Whitehead .

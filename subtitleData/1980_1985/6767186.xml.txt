But it 's ludicrous that county lines and parish boundaries should divide houses . Oh , come now , imagine . - Mary Fenwick and her twins . - Yes ? She might have been delivered of one in Somerset , pushed the bed across the room and had the second in Devon . Twins and a hernia ! - ( VICAR ) Good evening . - ( DOCTOR ) Good evening . Poor fellow . - Has he spoken to you yet ? - Alas , no . - I had hoped to see him in church . - Not that one . Three Sundays have now come and gone since he arrived . Some form of skin disease , Margaret says . But then she was only repeating what Mrs Lipton had told her . I deplore gossip , of course , but I suppose it 's inevitable that a person of so remarkable an appearance and bearing should form a source of idle talk in a village the size of Iping . Were you aware of the general view that he 's a criminal trying to escape justice ? No , I was not . What nonsense . - They don 't like him at all . - I am aware of that . Poor fellow . Change , damn you , change ! Oh ! Now there he goes again . ( MRS HALL SIGHING ) - He given you a name yet , Mr Hall ? - No , he ain 't , Sandy . - It 's not for the want of asking , neither . - It smells in here . Well , I reckon that 'll be chloroform . Or it 's what old Fearenside says . He says it 's opium . It ain 't right , Mr Hall , opium . Pacing up and down , up and down , babbling away to himself all the time , more like a blessed turkey . - What 's he been saying , then ? - It don 't make no sense to me . It ain 't proper , Sandy . He 's not given no name . He 's not given no money , neither , not for weeks now . - Oh ! - Oh , look at this , George . It 's just not good enough . Dear God . This 'll take me all my life . Now , you Palaeolithic tonic ... this time , do your work . Ugh ! Now , you devil . ( CRIES OUT ) - Oh , no . He 'll have to go , Janny . - ( SCREAMING ) We 've got folks walking up the hill to Sidderbridge rather than face him . - He 's right . - Even Archie Moon with his game Leg . Oh , no , he won 't do , old girl . Sidderbridge , they ain 't had business like this since we had the roof fall in . ( GLASS SMASHING ) - What 's he up to in there , then , eh ? - All I hear , morning , noon and night is paper being torn , glass breaking and him shouting and screaming as if a brick has dropped on his foot . And never a word of thank you for all the meals I 've cooked . Just don 't be too hasty , old girl . He 's got a very nasty temper on him . Oh , has he ? Oh ! Well , I 'll temper him ! Go on , out of my way , Teddy Henfrey . - Here , just a minute ... - Not just a minute . Now . Now . H ' you please ! If you please , sir ! Here , if there are any nasty stains on my carpet ... What is it that you want ? Well , sir , I expect you 'll be wanting to pay your bill now . Certainly not . Please don 't bother me at this time of night . I heard glass breaking . How do we know you 're not making bombs ? All them horrible smells . As I told you , if there is any damage , add it to my bill . How can I do that unless I see what damage has been done ? - I can 't have my experiments interfered with . - I won 't be locked out of my own parlour . - I pay you enough for the privacy ! - You promise me enough , sir , but you pay me nothing . I 've not had a farthing this month . No , I 'm afraid I shall have to ask you to Leave . Impossible . And I 'd thank you for the key to my parlour . George . It is only right , sir . The room has got to be cleaned . Give me the key or I shall have this door broke down and the lock changed . - ( CROWD MURMURING ) - This is ridiculous . - I am awaiting a remittance ... - Remittance , indeed ! I am not humbugging , but until it arrives ... Tomorrow , if you please , sir . Tomorrow you pays me my bill or you leaves this house before noon . - ( MURMURING ) - My sakes , Mrs Hall ! Hoo-hoo ! That told him ! I 'll have a brandy , please , George . A double measure . ( RUSTLING ) Damnation ! Edward ! - Edward ! - ( GROANS ) Edward , I heard the sound of breaking glass . Someone 's broken into the house , Edward . Let us not jump to conclusions , my dear . Edward ! Edward ! If one hears glass being broken , it does not necessarily mean one is about to be bludgeoned to death in one 's own bed . Don 't say such things ! ( COCKEREL CROWS ) Do go and Look , dear ! ( COCKEREL CROWS ) The bounder 's in the kitchen ! The window 's broken . My dear , wake Susie at once and send out for the constable . What are you going to do ? - Put the fear of God into the scoundrel - Then do take off your nightcap , dear . ( GRUNTING ) Surrender ! ( CLATTERING ) - Edward ... - ( MOUTHS ) ( WHISPERS ) Edward ... the window . The window . Huh ! He must still be here . - Such a draught , suddenly . - Sh ! ( MOUTHS ) - He found the housekeeping . - How much was in there ? Two pounds , ten shillings in half sovereigns . The constable should be here soon , dear . Margaret , I could have sworn he was in the room when we entered . - Yes , dear . - Who Lit the candle ? - And this knife . - He used it to force the Lock . Yes , but it fell to the ground after we came into the room . And yet , if that were so ... ( PANTING ) ( COUGHING ) George ? George ! * Oh ! I found the door ajar . He 's not here . Come here , George . Look , the front door 's open . Look . I don 't ... ( LABOURED BREATHING ) His clothes are still here . Well , I ... No , don 't touch ' em , George . I wonder where he could 've gone without any clothes and them bandages , eh ? ( SUCKS TEETH ) Well ! Cold as the grave . He must 've been up at least an hour or more . Here , what 's over here , George ? - What is it ? - Books . ( SNEEZE ) It weren 't me . George ! George , there 's spirits in this room . Here , I can hear ' em breathing . Here , don 't talk so daft , woman . Spirits don 't sneeze . Well , who was it , then , eh ? George ! Let 's ... let 's lock the door , George . Lock him out and them in . - ( SCRAPING ) - Come on . - What the ... ? - ( SHRIEKING ) Ooh ! Who did that ? What 's going on here ? - Aargh ! - Oh , stand up , for goodness ' sake , woman . - Oh ! Don 't , don 't ! - ( INVISIBLE MAN LAUGHING ) - Oh ! - Oh , no , sir ! - No ! No ! - ( LAUGHING ) - Oh , no ! - Oh ! - ( SHRIEKS ) - Soaked to the skin ! Now , my dear , exactly what time did the master call for you ? It 's the spirits ! Yes , I know , I know it 's the spirits . They 'll infest the whole house now . I 've read about ' em in the papers ! Dancing and singing . My good old furniture ! - You take a drop more . That 'll steady you . - Thank you , Sandy . - It 's not steady she 'll get on that stuff . - Oh , shut up . - Where is he now , then , Mr Hall ? - Oh , well , he 's gone . Before dawn , we reckon . He ain 't come back yet , neither . - You ought to lock him out - He 'll not get past me ! - What 's happening upstairs , then ? - Don 't you go near that room ! I don 't know . Door 's jammed shut just like it were Locked . - Do you hear anything ? - No , not a thing . - I reckon whatever it were is still there . - My good old furniture rising up against me ! I tell you what , Mrs Hall . You want horseshoes hung everywhere for gents like him . I 'll be darned if it ain 't witchcraft . Well , I might have known ! Eh ? Him ! Him with his bandaged head and his great , big goggling eyes . - And never going to church on Sundays . - That 's right ! He 's got more books and bottles than anyone has a right to . - Here , why don 't you bust down the door ? - Now , just a moment , hold hard . Let 's have the facts first . Best be sure he be acting right in busting it down . It 's his door . He can do what he likes . A door unbust is always open to busting . You can 't unbust a bust door once you 've busted it . Well , I ... - It 's Robbie . - How do , Robbie . How do . Fair old rumpus up the Vicarage , eh ? Fair old rumpus down here . - You ain 't heard ? - Heard what ? - Burglary . - The Vicarage ? Never . So help me . They reckon he took £ 20 in gold . - Who ? - It 's him ! - Don 't talk so daft . - Got in through a window . - It 's him ! - Vicar went for him but he got clear away . They 've got men with dogs out Sidderbridge way . - Ooh ! - It never rains but it pours . ( GASPS ) Good morning . Thank you . I trust that gun is not loaded , Mr Hall . ( TUT5 ) ( KEY TURNING ) - How did he get in , George ? - Well , if that don 't Lick everything ! How did he get in ? Ach ! Foot ' . ! ( SCOFFS ) No , no , no . ( SIGHS ) Idiots ! Dear heaven ! A student would know more . Bah ! This is useless ! Mm . Dr Samuel Kemp . Optical density . Kemp . Must be the same man . Join Kemp , ( VOICES OUTSIDE ) Of course ! Join Kemp , ( KNOCKING ) - I wanna know where he 's been . - You demand an explanation ! - We don 't want him in this house no Longer . - Break down the door . - Yes ? - Me and Mrs Hall , sir , we wanna know where you 've been this morning and how you got back in . That , sir , is none of your business . - Anyone staying here comes in by the door . - Tell him ! - It 's a rule of the house . - You demand an explanation ! - Go to the devil ! - ( ALL EXCLAIM ) Go to the devil ! And you , madam , may fetch my breakfast . - Oh ! - Why isn 't it prepared ? And why hasn 't my bill been paid ? So that 's it ! - ( cows CHINK ) - How much ? - Yesterday he said he didn 't have no money . - Mmm ! ( HALL ) I wonder where he got that . - What does that mean ? - It means I wonder where you got it . - Off the Vicarage ! - ( MRS HALL ) More than Likely . I 've no idea what you 're talking about . Did I not tell you that I was awaiting a remittance ? Did I not receive a package ? - Do you wish to be paid or not ? - Robbie , fetch the constable . - ( GENERAL ASSENT ) - Stay where you are ! By heaven , I 'll show you , you stupid bumpkins . - What ? - What 's he doing ? - Oh ! - There 's nothing there ! George ! Make him stop , George !

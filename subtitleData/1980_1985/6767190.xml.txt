 ( cows CHINK ) In less than fifteen minutes , I was ready to go forth into the world again , equipped . - And the shopkeeper ? - What about him ? - You may have killed him ! - He might have killed me ! He had a revolver . - He was in his shop and you were robbing it ! - Ah , fool ! - Can 't you see my position ? - And his , too . Common conventions of humanity , Griffin . They 're all very well for common people . You blame me for what I did ? Good Lord , no . Blame ? I never blame anyone for anything . It 's quite out of fashion . Ach ! You at least , I thought , would 've understood . You 've understood nothing . - ( CLOCK STRIKES ) - Well , I suppose you had to do what you did . - You were in a fix . - An infernal fix . Instead of bandages , why did you not paint and powder your face to make it visible ? I would need to remove it in order to vanish again . Yes , I see . The more I thought about it , the more I realised what a helpless absurdity an invisible man was , caught in a cold , dirty climate in a crowded , civilised city . Before I made this mad experiment , I had dreamt of a thousand advantages . That first day was all disappointment . I 'd gone over the List of the things a man reckons desirable . Invisibility makes it possible to get them but it also makes it impossible to enjoy them . Would you mind if I opened the window ? The smoke . Oh . What 's the use of ambition , Kemp ? What 's the good of pride of place when you can 't appear there ? I have no taste for politics , for the blaggardisms of fame , for philanthropy , for sport . What was I to do ? Kemp ! What was I to do ? For this I had become - a wrapped-up mystery , a bandaged caricature of a man . I had one hope , half a hope , and I have it still . A way of getting back , of restoring what I 've done , but only after I 've finished all that I mean to do invisibly . Kemp , sit down , sit down . I don 't want to hurt you , Kemp , but if you don 't help me , I will , I 'll smash you , Kemp . I 'll kill you . - I 've told you I 'll help you . - Excellent ! With you , this house , there 's no need for Plymouth or the steamer . - Steamer ? - To France , then south , somewhere warm , that was the plan . That WAS the plan . Algiers , perhaps . Somewhere I could move about freely without disguise . No need with you , Kemp . ( GRIFFIN ) As for that tramp ... ( KEMP ) What tramp ? Don 't you understand ? That tramp has stolen my notebooks . You must get them back , Kemp . Find that miserable cur and I shall kill him . Get my memoranda and I 'll kill the stinking Little rat . Let him be the first , the start of the terror . - ( CREAKING ) - There 's someone there ! No , no , this is an old house , full of creaks and groans . That tramp shouldn 't be too difficult to trace . He 's probably still in the neighbourhood . - You 've told no one I 'm here ? - Of course not . That was understood . There 's someone out there ! Let me Look . If there 's someone there , I 'll send them away . - It 's probably one of the servants . - Stand away ! Adye , help ! Judas ! Treachery ! UP here ! - Stop him ! - ( STRAINING ) I 'll kill you for this , Kemp , you traitor ! I 'll kill you ! - After him ! - ( GRIFFIN RAGING ) No need , Adye . He 'll be back . Back to kill me . ( ROOKS CAWING ) ( DOG BARKING ) ls he found ? Thank you , Rose . He 's insane , Adye , inhuman . He dreams of a reign of terror . He 's already wounded men . Killed them , for all I know . He 'll roam around the countryside , killing and maiming . No one can stop him ! And if it 's the last thing he does , he 'll get even with me . He counted on me and I betrayed him . I don 't mind admitting I 'm terrified . ( ADYE ) I have already wired the garrison for help . The prison officials at Halstead have sent two men with bloodhounds . They 'll soon get the wind of your invisible man . I 've set every available officer to work . We must prevent him from leaving the district . - Have a watch set on trains and roads . - And shipping . - He raved on about a steamer to Europe . - And shipping . Have a proclamation posted warning people to be on their guard . Yes , sir . The only thing that will keep him here is revenge and the thought of getting those notebooks back . - Oh , yes . The tramp . - You 've found him ? Apparently he spent the night in one of our strongest cells at his own request . - Then you have the notebooks . - He denies their existence . And you believe him ? Well , Griffin believes he has them and he 'll stop at nothing to get them back . We have one advantage . He won 't be able to carry a weapon without giving himself away . Night , he can do as he pleases . And he 's naked . It will take more than cold weather to stop Griffin . You 'd best stay indoors until we have him . - Don 't worry about that . - My men will be in the grounds . - Where are you going ? - Council of war . I want every house in the vicinity searched , and then further afield . - Yes , sir ! - When he eats , his food will show . - What ? - Here , until it 's assimilated . Oh ! He 'll have to hide after his eating . Good . Surely we should prevent him from eating , starve him out . You 're right . I 'll have every house in the district barred to him . There 's one other thing . It sounds cruel but it might stop him . Lay broken glass on all the roads approaching this house and the police station . - Mmm . - Damn it , this is not a game . He 's an invisible maniac . He 's cut himself off from his own kind . It 's blood chilling to think what might happen . He 's active and powerful . He 's very , very dangerous ! ( BIRDSONG ) - How do , Mr Hinton . - You 're a hard man to track down , Charlie . - I ain 't done nothing wrong - Leastways , not lately . - What 's up , then ? - Madman Loose . You 'd best get on home . - Keep indoors , unless you 're armed . - What 's he done , this fella ? Disappeared . ( CRIES OUT ) - Lucy . - I 've closed them all except the pantry , sir . - The hinge was that rusty , it wouldn 't move . - I 'll deal with it myself . Take this note to Colonel Adye . - Again . - Go now , please , and don 't stop for anybody or anything , do you understand ? - I 'll just fetch my hat . - Leave it . Go now ! Don 't Loiter . Run all the way , if you 're able . It 's a matter of Life and death . ( GRIFFIN PANTING ) - ( GASPS ) - Give it to me ! - Give it to me ! - ( SOBBING ) Help ! Help ! Oh , there , there . ( KNOCKING ) Who is it ? Adye . Let me in . - Your sen / ant 's been assaulted . - What ? ls she alive ? She 'll be all right . Nasty gash in the head , hysterical , of course , but she 's lucky . Lucky ? My God ! Poor , wretched girl . They found a man in a field near Fern Bottom , a labourer . He 'd been beaten about the head with a wooden stave . - I thought there was no danger for her . - You sent her ? - He must have seen her Leave . - Why did you send her ? I sent her with a note for you . I received this Letter from Griffin . Mm-hm . - How did this come ? - Postmarked Hintondean , with an official stamp saying tuppence to pay . Hmm . ( GRIFFIN ) You 've been very clever , Kemp , but what you stand to gain by it , I cannot imagine . The game is only beginning . Today be the first day of the terror . Day one of year one of the new epoch , the epoch of the Invisible Man . Death starts for you today , Kemp . You may lock yourself away , put on armour , if you like , but the unseen death is coming . The game has begun . Death starts ! Help him not , my people , lest death fall upon you also . Today , Kemp is to die . - The man 's raving . - It 's no hoax , Adye . He means it . - Have you got shutters upstairs ? - Only in the downstairs rooms . There 's no way he can get in . A cat couldn 't climb up . - Face it , Adye , he 's winning . - Rubbish ! Fella 's surrounded for 20 miles . What 's the good of that , man ? He 's here , outside ! He must be . Armed men with dogs are beating the woods and fields . You saw that letter ! He won 't leave here until I 'm dead . - ( GLASS SMASHING ) - Stay there ! - ( GLASS SMASHING ) - The study ! - ( GLASS SMASHING ) - That was downstairs . This business is beyond reason . You might as well pit your wits against a ghost . I get the measure of my opponents . I fight visible crime , not some " now you see me , now you don 't " . - But what shall we do ? - The bloodhound 'll settle him . But how ? He 's out there . - Have you got a gun ? - No . Not to spare , anyway . Hmm . I 'll bring it back . You stay here . You 'll be all right . Adye , this is madness ! You lock this the moment I 'm out . ( ROOKS CAWING ) Griffin ! - Don 't move . - ( GUNSHOT ) My God . - Well ? - Go back to the house . - He 'd never let me in . - That would be a pity . I shall have to kill you and we have no quarrel . Move ! Kemp ! I want you , Kemp . - ( BANGING ) - I 'm coming to get you , Kemp ! ( HEAVY AXE BLOWS ) ( BLOWS CONTINUE FROM THE HOUSE ) Kemp ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help me ! Help me ! Help me ! Please ! Let me in ! Let me in ! He 's coming , he 's coming ! Help me ! Help me ! Here 's here ! Here 's here ! Watch for the axe ! Spread out ! Spread out . Form a line . Form a line . He must still be here somewhere . - ( SNARLING ) - ( CHOKING ) Ugh ! No ! ( CHOKING ) I 've got him ! I 've got him . - Give up , Griffin . You 're trapped . - ( GASPING AND CHOKING ) ( AGONISED CRIES ) - ( THUDDING ) - ( GRIFFIN ) Have mercy ! Have mercy ! - ( STRANGLED CRY ) - Stand back ! He 's hurt ! He 's hurt ! - Griffin ! - He 's shamming ! Get back ! - Griffin ! - Don 't you leave him go , sir . ( GRIFFIN ) Help me ... Help me ... ( FAINTLY ) Help ... Badly injured . We shall need a stretcher . Kemp ... ( SIGHS ) the game is over . Hang on , Griffin . - Such power , Kemp . - Don 't talk . All for nothing . Look ! ( BELL TOLLS ) Now , Harry . Want to hear a story ? Penny a night I 'll be charging up at the Empire music hall . You can hear it for nothing . See these ? Secrets . Full of them . Er , here . Er ... X ... X ... little 2 up in the air ... cross ... and that ... fiddle-di-dee . Lord ! What a one he was for intellect . Wonderful secrets , my friend . All Left to me . And when I get the hang of them , Lord , what won 't I do ! Mmm . Not ... not like him . He just ... Yes ... You wait .

You 're young ... you look normal , you 're innocent . You keep clear of people like me , and you might stay alive . What you do , I do . I 've thought it out . I 'm good at staying alive . When shall we meet again ? Not for several weeks . It 's not safe . Give me half an hour . I love you . Julia ... Do you think the Resistance is real ? No . None of it 's real . Steamer !

" What is it ? I dreamt ... about my mother . What , darling ? It was during the wars ... before the Party . Winston ! I couldn 't help myself . I knew what I had done ... and I couldn 't help myself . When I went back , hours later ... my mother and sister were gone . I never saw them again . So it 's not just staying alive . It 's staying human that 's important . What counts ... is that we don 't betray each other . If you mean confessing , we 're bound to do that . Everybody does . You can 't help it . I don 't mean confessing . Confessing isn 't betrayal . I mean feelings . If they can make me change my feelings ... they can stop me from loving you . That will be real betrayal . They can 't do that . It 's the one thing they can 't do . They can torture you ... and make you say anything . But they can 't make you believe it . They can 't get inside you . They can 't get to your heart . I 'm going to see O 'Brien . I know . Outer Party Member 53922 ... Hicks , Minirec , Proletarian Affairs Section . Outer Party Member 22315 ...

That concludes the list of known agents of Goldstein ... actively engaged in the latest conspiracy ... Not much of this gets to the Outer Party , I 'm afraid . To our leader . ... that our eternal allies in Eurasia are turning against us . More nests of conspirators and saboteurs have been uncovered ... and further arrests are expected shortly . You can ... Yes . We are allowed that privilege . Some more of this ? It 's called wine . There are thoughtcriminals who maintain the Resistance is not real . Believe me , Winston ... it is very real . Perhaps you are not familiar with how it operates . I 'm attentive to the news . Indeed . Perhaps you imagine a huge network of conspirators ... prepared to commit any atrocity to demoralize ... and weaken the order of our society . The reality is infinitely more subtle . If Goldstein himself ... fell into the hands of the Thought Police , he could not give them a list of his agents . Such a list does not exist . They 're not an organization in the sense we know . Nothing holds it together but an idea . There is no possibility of change in their lifetime . In the face of the Thought Police ... they cannot act collectively . Individually , they cheat ... forge , blackmail , corrupt children ... spread disease and prostitution ... in the name of spreading knowledge from generation to generation . Until ... in a thousand years ... You may find this of interest . Thank you . ... address a rally in Victory Square at 21 ... 30 hours . That is the end of the announcement . Goodbye , brother . They have attacked an unarmed village with rocket bombs ... and murdered 4,000 defenseless , innocent ... and peaceful citizens of Oceania . This is no longer war . This is cold-blooded murder . Until now , the war has been conducted with honor ... and bravery ... with the ideals of truth and justice , in the best traditions of mankind ... until this moment . Brothers and sisters ... the endless catalogue of bestial atrocities ... which will inevitably ensue from this appalling act ... must , can , and will be terminated . The forces of darkness and treasonable maggots ... who collaborate with them , must , can , and will ... be wiped from the face of the earth . We must crush them . We must smash them . We must stamp them out . We , the people of Oceania will not rest until a final victory has been achieved . Death to the eternal enemy of Oceania . Death ! Brothers and sisters ... one week from now ... in this very square ... we shall , as a demonstration of our resolve ... as a sure sign to those who attempt to threaten ... our Party and our State ... we shall execute publicly ... the same number of Eastasian prisoners ... by hanging , drawing and quartering . Big , Big , Big ... " In accordance to the principles of Doublethink ... " it does not matter if the war is not real ... " or when it is , that victory is not possible . " The war is not meant to be won . It is meant to be continuous . " The essential act of modern warfare ... " is the destruction of the produce of human labor . " A hierarchical society is only possible on the basis of poverty and ignorance . " In principle , the war effort is always planned ... " to keep society on the brink of starvation . " The war is waged by the ruling group against its own subjects . " And its object is not victory over Eurasia or Eastasia ... " but to keep the very structure of society intact . " Julia ? Are you awake ? There is truth , and there is untruth . To be in a minority of one doesn 't make you mad . Julia , my love ... I understand how . I don 't understand why . I 'm hungry . Let 's make some more coffee . The water 's cold . There 's no oil in it . That 's strange . I thought it was full . They say that time heals all things They say you can always forget But the smiles and the tears across the years they twist my heartstrings yet . She 's beautiful . She 's a meter across the hips . Easily . It 's her style of beauty . The future is hers . We are the dead . We are the dead . You are the dead . Remain exactly where you are . Make no move until you are ordered . Now they can see us . Now we can see you . Clasp your hands behind your heads . Stand out in the middle of the room . Stand back-to-back . Do not touch one another . The house is surrounded . The house is surrounded . I suppose we may as well say goodbye . You may as well say goodbye . While we 're on the subject ... " Here comes a candle to light you to bed . " Here comes a chopper to chop off your head . " Pick that up . Thought Police . 6079 Smith . Open your eyes . Parsons . Keep away from me , Smith . I 'm an agent of Goldstein . I didn 't know it myself . Thoughtcrime is so insidious . It just creeps up on you . My daughter found it out . Very proud of her . Very grateful I 've been discovered before it 's too late . They won 't shoot me , will they , Smith ? I know I could be very useful in a labor camp . Room 101 . No . Please , you don 't have to take me there . Why ? There 's nothing I won 't confess . Nothing . I 've told you everything already . What is it you want me to know ? Take him instead of me . He 's the thoughtcriminal . It 's him you want . They got you , too . They got me a long time ago . You knew this would happen , Winston . Don 't deceive yourself . You 've always known it . The photos of you and the girl will be recycled for proletarian use . Do you know where you are , Winston ? I don 't know . I can guess . In the Ministry of Love . Do you know how long you 've been here ? No . Weeks ? Months ? Do you know why you 're here ? Shall I tell you why we brought you here ? To cure you . To make you sane . That was 40 . You can see that the numbers on this dial run up to 100 . Will you please remember that , during our conversation ? I have it in my power to inflict pain on you at any time ... and in whatever degree I choose . You know perfectly well what is the matter with you , Winston . You 've known it for years , though you 've fought against the knowledge . You are mentally deranged . You suffer from a defective memory . You never tried to cure yourself of it , because you did not choose to . It was a small effort of will , which you were not ready to make . For example ... which power is Oceania at war with ? Eastasia . Oceania is at war with Eastasia . Eastasia . Good . And Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia , has it not ? Tell me what you think you remember . I remember ... that until only a week before I was arrested ... we weren 't at war with Eastasia at all . It was Eurasia . That lasted four years , I think . Another example . A serious delusion . Photographs about which you 've had hallucinations ... which you believed you held in your hand . They never existed . Say what you were about to say , Winston . They exist ... in memory . I remember . You remember . I do not remember . Only the disciplined mind can see reality , Winston . It needs an act of self-destruction ... an effort of the will . Do you remember writing in your diary : " Freedom is the freedom to say two plus two equals four ? " Yes . How many fingers am I holding up ? Four . And if the Party says there are not four , but five , then how many ? Five . No . That 's no use . You 're lying . How many fingers , please ? Four . What else could I say ? Five , or anything you like . Will you please stop it ? Stop the pain . How can I help it ? How can I help what I see in front of my eyes ? Two and two makes four . Sometimes , Winston . Sometimes they are five , sometimes they are three . Sometimes they are all of them at once . Neither the past , nor the present , nor the future ... exists in its own right . Reality is in the human mind ... not in the individual mind ... which makes mistakes and soon perishes ... but in the mind of the Party ... which is collective and immortal . - Again . - No . How many fingers , Winston ? Four . Four , I suppose there are four . I tried to see five . I wish I could . Which do you wish ? To persuade me that you can see five , or really to see them ? Really to see them . Again . How many , Winston ? I don 't know . Better . No one escapes , Winston . There are no martyrs here . All the confessions made here are true . We do not destroy the heretic because he resists us . As long as he resists us , we never destroy him . We make him one of ourselves before we kill him . We make his brain perfect before we blow it out . And then ... when there is nothing left but sorrow and love of Big Brother ... we shall lift you clean out of history . We shall turn you into gas and pour you into the stratosphere . Nothing will remain of you . Not a name in a register . Not a memory in a living brain . You will be annihilated in the past , as well as in the future . Three thousand . This time it won 't hurt you . Before we bring this session to an end ... I want you to ask me your questions . I want you to clear your mind . Julia . She betrayed you , Winston ... immediately , unreservedly . All her rebellion , deceit , folly , dirty-mindedness ... has been turned out of her . Does Big Brother exist ? Of course . The same way as me ? You do not exist . You 've not asked me the question that is uppermost in your mind . You know what is in Room 101 . Everyone knows what 's in Room 101 . Now ... fix your eyes on mine . What country is Oceania at war with ? I don 't remember . Oceania is at war with Eastasia . Do you remember that now ? Yes . How many fingers am I holding up ? Five . You see , at least , that it is possible . You 've understood the reality of the past ... and of the present . Now for the future . A question : " How does one man assert power over another ? " By making him suffer . Exactly . Obedience is not enough . Power is inflicting pain and humiliation . Otherwise , you cannot be sure . Power is tearing human minds apart ... and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing . Power is not a means , it is an end . In our world , there will only be triumph and self-abasement . Everything else , we shall destroy . The past is forbidden . Why ? Because when we can cut man from his own past ... then we can cut him from his family , his children , other men . There is no loyalty , except loyalty to the Party . There is no love , except love of Big Brother . All competing pleasures , we will destroy . If you want a vision of the future , imagine ... a boot stamping on a human face forever . You are thinking that my face is old and tired ... that while I talk of power ... I 'm unable to prevent the decay of my own body . But the individual is only a cell . And the weariness of the cell is the vigor of the organism . - You 'll fail . - Why ? It 's impossible . Hatred , the fear of life . Why is hate less vital than love ? I don 't know . But somehow you 'll fail . Something will defeat you . Life will defeat you . We control life at all levels . We create human nature . Men are infinitely malleable . Or perhaps you 've returned to your old idea that the proletarians will arise . Put it out of your mind . They are helpless animals . Humanity is the body . I don 't care . In the end , they 'll beat you . Sooner or later , they 'll tear you to pieces . On what evidence ? Goldstein 's book . I wrote it . Or , at least , I collaborated in writing it . No book is individually produced , as you know . I just believe it . I know you 'll fail . Something in this world ... some spirit you will never overcome " ... " What is it , this principle ? I don 't know . The spirit of man . And do you consider yourself a man ? Yes . If you are a man , you 're the last man . Your kind is extinct . We are the inheritors . Do you understand that you are alone ? You are outside history . You unexist . Get up . Come here . Look at you . You 're rotting away . That is the last man . If you are human , that is humanity . It will not last forever . You can escape from it whenever you choose . Everything depends on you . You did it . You reduced me to this . No , Winston . You reduced yourself to it . When will you shoot me ? Might take a long time . But don 't give up hope . Everyone is cured sooner or later . And in the end ... we shall shoot you . The law of gravity is nonsense . No such law exists . If I think I float ... and you think I float ... then it happens . I love you . You have the strength , Winston . You have the whole Party . You are the Party . You 're one of us , one of the chosen . I love you . I love you , too . Julia , my love . Get up . Stand up straighter . Look me in the face . Tell me , Winston , and remember , no lies . What are your true feelings towards Big Brother ? - I hate him . - You must love him . It 's not enough to obey him . You must love him . Room 101 . You asked me once , Winston , what was in Room 101 . I told you that you knew , already . Everyone knows . The thing that is in Room 101 ... is the worst thing in the world . It goes beyond fear of pain or death . It is unendurable , and it varies from individual to individual . It may be burial alive or castration ... or many other things . In your case , it is rats . No . Please . What do you want me to do ? You will do what is required of you . What ? What is it ? How can I do it if I don 't know what it is ? In the proletarian areas , they will attack a baby ... and within five minutes , strip it to the bone . They also attack the sick and dying . They show astonishing intelligence in knowing when a human being is helpless . Please . The mask fits over your head , leaving no exit . I press the first lever ... and the rats move into the front compartment . I press the second , and the door of the cage will slide up . These starving brutes will shoot at you like bullets . Have you ever seen a rat leap through the air ? They will leap onto your face and bore straight into it . Sometimes they attack the eyes first . Sometimes they burrow through the cheeks and devour the tongue . Tell me . What do you want ? No , please . I love you . Do it to her ! Do it to Julia ! I don 't care what you do to her , but do it to her ! Tear her my face off ! Do it to Julia , not to me ! Do it to Julia ! Not me ! A vast military buildup has been reported in the Sahara Desert ... in Sectors 17 and 18 of the war zones . That is the end of the announcement . Brother . On the house . Thank you for coming . You are warned to stand by for an important announcement at 15 ... 30 . This is news of the gravest national consequence ... concerning the war with Eurasia . 15 ... 30 . Are you worried about the African front ? The news is disquieting in the extreme . I 've been worrying about it all day . It 's not just a question of losing Africa . For the first time , the territory of Oceania itself is threatened by invasion . It 's inconceivable . It must have been possible to outflank them in some way . I have an instinct . There 's bad news on the way . I told them all about you . I 'm only thankful they got me before it was too late . Yes , I told them about you , too . Thoughtcrime ... sexcrime , all your treachery . I have a meeting to go to . We must meet again . Yes . We must meet again . I accuse myself of the following crimes ... I have seduced Party members of both sexes ... I 've been to the proletarian areas ... I deliberately contracted syphilis in order to spread the disease ... to my wife and other Party members . Together with other agents , I have counterfeited banknotes ... wrecked industrial machinery , polluted the water supply ... guided Eurasian rocket bombs to targets on Airstrip One ... by means of coded radio signals . I stand here , a victim of the influence of Emmanuel Goldstein . Guilty on all counts . I 'm glad I was caught . I was mentally deranged . Now I am cured . I ask only for you to accept my love of our leader . I ask only to be shot while my mind is still clean . A glorious victory ! A vast , strategic maneuver to outflank ... the Eurasian Forces on the African front has been successful . Perfectly coordinated , it has resulted in the utter rout of the Eurasian Army . There have been nearly a million prisoners . It has been an utter rout . Waiter ? This immense victory brings the war within measurable distance of its end . Wonderful news . I love you .

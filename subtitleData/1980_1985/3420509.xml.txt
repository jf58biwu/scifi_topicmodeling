 I apologise for mistakes , should you spot any .. " Tomorrow is Today - it 's just tommorow " ' All unauthorized personnel are required to leave the first security zone ! ' ' I repeat : All unauthorized personnel ... ' ' are required to leave the first security zone ! ' We 're coming in . You can take off the covering . Bad sign . No .. It sometimes by itself .. You know , the internal tensions of glass .. We 'd better go or they 'll blame us . Ladies and gentlemen , it is a few minutes past the mindnight . Today is 9th August 1991 . Remember this date . It is more than certain that it will be written with golden letters in the history of mankind . Here he is , the man who invented immortality . The Nobel Prize winner , professor and MSc Wikotor Kuppelweiser . Welcome , professor , in our TV studio . Maybe immortality is exaggeration . I only managed to bring a human organism into the state of anabiosis , in other words - hibernation . Right .. I 'd like to also add , that ... The recent experiment carried out by ... professor Kuppelweiser 's team , to freeze a chimpanzee for 6 months , was fully successful . Excuse me , the experiment was to defrost ! . Let me introduce : - Mr Albert Starski and Mr Maximilian ... - Paradys . Paradys , of course .. These two handsome , great and courageous men ... in a moment will be locked in the containers we could call ... - ... the sarcophagi of the 21st cantury . - Excuse me .. We call those hibernators , not sarcophagi .. Coco ! Right .. In three years , they will wake up ... as the living , let 's hope , evidence of the victory ... of human thought over the powers of nature . What was it that convinced you to take part ... in such a thrilling enterprise ? Let me cut this short : responsibility . 'I , a modest biologist , have the opportunity ... to be useful for the whole mankind . I know , it may sound like cliche , but I really think like that . Try to realise .. Thanks to the hibernation , many people ... with incurable diseases will be able to travel into times ... in which we will have known the cures for their illness . ' Our son is now a very important person . Like , let 's say , Gagarin , or others like him . Well , I have always been tempted by the risk , the unknown .. The life on the edge , so to say . ' And , the hibernation , I can tell , has been for me .. ' You better admit you 're doing it for the money . - You bastard .. - ' .. it is an experiment for the whole mankind .. ' To leave us completely alone .. Look at that rascal , it 's your daddy . - Remember him . - ' When I got to know that volunteers were needed I came over and I they chose me . ' ' Thank you very much . Would you like to add anything else ? ' Here , in our name , I 'd like to greet all hibernation fans from the whole world . And the last question : Aren 't you two afraid ? Of what ? Right , after all , the method has been tested , Coco is here with us .. Yes .. However , to make things clear , I want to say that obviously there is certain risk . - Excuse me ? - From the experiments on animals ... it is difficult to say what influence will it have ... on human 's mental stability . We cannot say how the pituitary gland will react . Once the experiment is over , hallucinations may appear . So , let us move on to that cave of knowledge ... which , as in the tale about Seasamus , will take in our heroes , only to let them out after three years , as we will say ' Open Up Seasamus ' , hopefully safe and sound . I 'd like to remind you that in three days ... we 're meeting on the Worldwide Gathering of Women 's League . The League - Power , Wisdom , Loyality ! Thank you , goodnight . " SEXMISSION " - I can 't see anything ! - That 's normal after hibernation . - Is it over ? - Yes , it 's over . - Thank you . Thank you .. I can 't see .. - We 've made it ? - Yes , you have . Ha , didn 't I tell you ? One , two , and that 's it ! Darkness ! I see darkness ! It 's darkness I can see ! I sweat terribly . How about you ? The body lets it out . That 's a common thing .. You 're right . A typical after-hibernation reaction . Good morning : ) What a nice room service . Breakfast .. Thank you very much . It 's been three years since I had anything in my mouth . Crescent rolls , eggs .. How nice . Excuse me , this bread is stale .. Oh , of course ! Now , that 's inventive .. Thank you . I have lost my taste . It doesn 't have any taste at all ! You are still on the adaptation diet . Oh .. If you say so .. I feel a bit sick . If I don 't get a cigarette .. Wait a second ! I got it ! Ha ! - Now , you are irresponsible ! - I 'm sorry .. from hand . Besides , you can 't smoke here . There 's no ashtray in here . We may not know . And nobody is looking anyway .. Please , take one . - Only symbolically , for company .. - ' See ? ' ' Because , you see , as a rule I don 't smoke . It 's bad for my health . ' ' And after eating .. ' It works ! That 's better .. A cigarette . ' I think it 's exaggeration about that bad influence . ' ' I have been smoking since I was six .. And I 'm still alive . ' ' Excuse me .. I burped after that plastic food . ' ' It 's after that pink one . ' They may cause a fire . Maybe we shouldn 't smoke while the quarantine ? In a few days , it 's gonna all start . Intervews , autographs , visiting people at work .. You 'll see , there 's going to be too much of it . Excuse me .. Here you are .. I guess smoking is not allowed in here .. - Proffesor Kuppelweiser ? - Yeah .. - A winner of , so called , Nobel Prize ? - Yeah .. He doesn 't exist . - Yeah .. What ? - Excuse me ? Sister , what is going on here ? The experiment was a success , yes ? We are heroes , yes ? Extinguisher foam was poured on me , yes ? So what the hell is this all about ? I want to speak with your supervisor . You should be happy that you are alive ... and that we dehibernated you at all . Why wouldn 't you have done that ? The experiment wouldn 't make any sense .. During the war we had more important things ... than scientific experiments . What war ? We were to be woken up no matter the political situation . - Why should I care about your wars ? - Ours ? - It was your war . We don 't know wars . - She 's being insolent ! - So .. Who won ? - What ? - The war ! What do you thimk he 's talking about ? Not important who won , more important who survived . Excuse me , where is professor Kuppelweiser ? - Dr Lamia has already told you . - That he doesn 't exist ? What do you mean ' doesn 't exist ' ? - He had an accident again , didn 't he ? - As all the others . Excuse me , we would like to speak to the head of this camp . Yes ? I 'd prefer a man .. They do not understand anything , sister . Contacting with a representative of your gender is .. undoable . Un .. un-what ? - You are the only males that exist . - Men have become extinct . Extinct ? They were not mammoths ! Apparently , they were . So to say .. - Excuse me , what day do we have ? - 8th March . You were sleeping a little bit longer than it had been planned . More than three years ? - Five ! - No . - Four ! I have already seen her somewhere .. Excuse me , doctor , I don 't give a monkey , my contract was for three years ... Youre gonna pay us up .. for the overtime work . What year is it ? - 44 - 2044 . No men ? So .. why aren 't here any windows ? Why isn 't there a handle at the door ? And we were sleeping for 53 years ? It must be the hallucination the professor was talking about . Yes .. It was nice talking to you but .. Excuse us .. We 'll be going now . We 're already late anyway .. Goodbye . Mr Albert , the ladies have to excuse us . ' Time for a pill ! ' Sister , will I be necessary ? No , thanks , I 'd prefer working alone . So I 'll be going , goodbye . There are electricity problems on 3 . I 'll take care of it tommorow . Goodnight . Treating us with an electric shock ? Us ? The heroes ? With an electric shock ? What is going on here ? We have to work out the muscles . What is going on ? What is that ? It supposed to be so beautiful . The interviews were to be there .. What is goin on ? Ouch .. Dont say anything . Electric shocks may have positive effect on the organism . This must be the next phase of the experiment . The resistance of a dehibernated man to mental disturbance . What are you talking , dear mister ? What am I ? A giunea pig ? The world without guys ! I wonder how they would , excuse my language , breed ? ! ' Don 't worry about that . Anyway , it has always been ... ' a woman , who started a life . ' Yes , but we helped you a bit , didn 't we ? - And it wasn 't without pleasu ... . - Have you heard ... about artificial parthenogenesis ? This is an official protest against eavesdropping on private conversation ! Thanks to parthenogenesis we are self-suffucient . - Parthe-what ? - Parthenogenesis .. Asexual reproduction .. Apogamia .. - If it has come to this .. - To what ? What has it come to ? What happened ? ' Time to sleep . ' ' What is it , that apogamia ? ' ' No .. You better don 't ask .. ' Remember your first dream in the new place . ' Dreams are very important . ' I just hope that we haven 't woken up yet .. Mr Max .. Why ? What is it ? Good night . Don 't turn the lights off , please ! Can I make a call to the city ? I asked a question ! My wife is worrying ! Don 't you , from Genetix , think it is inappropriate to pop up that late ? Good evening . I haven 't interrupted anythig , have I ? It is a quite private visit . I was just passing by ... and decided to come in to see you . But you must be busy with interesting work ... if you have stayed for the night . Everything is in the leaflets , sister . Oh , of course .. But you won 't find there the info on the special assignements . Of course , it is top secret . Right .. Oh , I have something for you .. What 's the special occasion ? What do you mean ? Your success ! - They say you have dug something out . - Rumours . Don 't let them pull your leg . Oh really ? You were brought from your holiday , one .. The area of the excavavation has been shut , two .. One and two gives us three .. And three means a secret . It 's simple deduction . Could deduct somewhere else ? I just wanted to take a bath and go to sleep . I understand .. The secret is exhausting . It 's a pity you left Genetix . You would have made a career . I can 't complain being here , in Archeo . Archeo - reopening old sores .. Well , bye my darling . Nevertheless , it would be better if you ... passed them over to us . Whom ? Well , whom ? Mr Max , where are you ? Good morning ! Is everything alright ? Ehm .. Yes .. Good Mornin .. Turn that down ! What are you doing ? What are you looking for ? ' It is futile . You won 't find anything .. ' I can 't stand it ! Being constantly peeked on ! I can 't stand it ! ' Parthenogenesis - a form of asexual reproduction ... ' - Did you order television ? - Mr Max .. ' Where was parthenogenesis done for the first time ? ' ' The first artifical parthenogenesis was done 130 years ago ... ' - Test tube kids .. - Are they ? Yes , I even can see the similarity .. ' ... did parthenogenesis of a frog ... ' ' by poking into an unfertilized ovum ... ' ' with a glass needle . In 1939 .. ' ' Our procreation method is the most perfect . ' Shame on you ! Teaching children such disguisting things .. Poke into an unfertilized ovum .. In a womb .. Mechanically .. Ovum with ovum ? I 'm eating here ! For God 's sake .. They already know ! Tekla was here yesterday . I knew they would get to know .. Genetix have their women everywhere . Will they want to take them from us ? Relics and excavations are our issues . Tekla knows it very well . I 'm just afraid that .. - How 's the research ? - Moving on , thanks . It can be proved that men are ... the missing link between us and apes in the evolution theory . Aren 't they agressive ? No .. The taller one is good-tempered . The shorter one is a bad influence . Remember that the danger of contamination still exists . Restrain your contacts with them to the minimum . - Thank you , sister . - Take care of yourself . ' Mr Albert we have to invent ourselvs a language ' ' Take the pill ' ' Do you speak some foreign language ? ' ' Well .. no .. They could translate , anyway .. ' ' Let 's do like this : ' ' When I take two spoons of that pink stuff ... ' ' it may mean " Take Cover ! " ' ' Or , when I take off my shirt ... ' ' It may mean " Come on ! " ' ' You 're talking about a secret signalization code ? ' ' Yes , something like that . ' ' Mr Max .. Your idea is incomprehensible in this reference system . ' ' What ? Well .. We 'll never communicate like that .. ' Mr Albert , are you awake too ? I 'm cold .. They must have turned some fan on , or something . Damn ! Mr Max , lie down beside me . It 's going to be warmer . Thank you .. Like in the army .. Mr Albert .. Please , honestly , as a scientist .. Is it possible for women to reproduce by themselves ? Yes , it is , absolutely . It was possible even in our times . - But never at such a scale .. - My God .. Fifty three years .. We slept over the best years of our lives . In one sweep we lost our families , friends .. But in ' 91 I was supposed to get a flat ! I 'll never let them freeze myself again . - Would you have any more of that ? - Oh .. Excuse me .. Here you are .. Mr Albert .. What 's happened ? You can 't like that .. What 's done is done . We 'll have to get used somehow . Humans can adapt to all conditions .. Here you are .. I was thinking .. maybe .. like colleagues .. I didn 't dare .. - Albert . - Maximilian . Thank you . ' This is the last chance match for Archeo ! ' ' Genetix will do with draw ! ' ' One minute to go ! ' ' Maybe now ! Yes ! ' Great ! ' Now , the traditional T-shirt exchange .. ' What is goin on ? What 's that ? Take a look at this , Albert ! You have to see that ! That 's a fantastic show .. You 're watching it all days . This is what they want . Now , this midfielder has good contitions .. Replay ! They didn 't give a replay .. If we could organise it well .. This could be a paradise .. - What ? - A paradise , I tell you ! Only women , unmarried .. Only the two of us , virtually no competition .. Nature can 't be deceived ! Do you like brunettes or blondes ? Our civilisation is ruined and and all you can think about are chicks . Here comes our blondie .. Shall we try ? Good morning . We 've started day 5 of the quarantine . Try to determine , in 1 to 10 scale , your general mood . With you around , 7 . For now .. Let me out ! That means 1 . The food ? Thank you , it has got much better . That pink stuff is really tasty . 5 .. or even 6 . I don 't eat and I don 't intend to eat . We 'll have to provide food directly to vein .. Physical fitness ? 10 ! Do you wish anything ? Couldn 't we go together for a walk , to dance .. ? What right do you have to touch me ? ! The eternal right of nature , my dear . It was very unhygienically ! I warn you , I 'll have to use physical force ! And I warn you that I was the champion in 1st step in boxing . Claun ! Turn on some music , will you ? - Will you dance ? - Don 't come closer ! I 'm not aggressive , aggressiveness - 1 . Don 't do this again ... or you 'll make us put you to sleep . Max , are you ok ? Albert , it 's working ! What 's wrong , sister ? Can we help ? Do you feel sick ? I 'm alright . Get back to work . Who let her in ? She 's got the authorisation . We couldn 't do anything . ' Who could expect ? ' You should treat them more carefully . They 're unique . ' Such woman is able to throw a man like that .. ' My name is Emma Dax . We 're going to work together . They are very important for the Genetix ' programme ... in which the government is interested . I 'am responsible for the genetic safety of this area . Thus , you will obey my orders . I don 't care about your orders . Only dr Berna is my supervisor . I think I have to report to her about your presence here . You 'll have the chance to do that . Dr Berna is at Her Majesty 's , who wishes to see the males . I came to keep your company on the way to her . My friend wants to go for a walk ! Put this on . Put the shirt into the trousers . A women giving orders to me .. The gloves . Oh , come on .. Don 't make us gay ! It 's necessary if you want to get out of here . So , we 're not in the former Kuppelweiser 's clinics ? Sorry .. Whait a scond ! Where are you taking me to ? - Follow me , please . - Good morning . Where am I led to ? I 'm moving , miss .. Entrance 3 , open up . Tell me where is your daddy ? What is " daddy " ? Poor baby .. My little .. Me too ! You don 't know what ' daddy ' is ? What have they done to you .. Sister , take these children away . Let 's go . Parents were taken from them .. - Poor children .. Max , they don 't know what ' dad ' is ! Apocalypse .. Emma Dax to Her Majesty . God , post-radiation mutants .. Albert .. What times are we living in .. Look , apples ! And there are two of them .. They 're here . Hibernation is future . If we were able to decrease the body temperature only by 2 degrees ... we would live twice as long . Here are our girls with the males . Let 's go to see them . I am very curious . They smell specifically .. They sweat . It 's after the hibernation . How old are they ? 86 , but bilogically it is 40.5 percent . What will we do with them ? Excuse me , you are someone important here , am I right ? Well , me and my friend have a few questions to you . Her Majesty should be called Her Majesty . In that case , I apologise . Please , let me .. - My name is Paradys . - Watch out ! Let him go ! - He didn 't mean to .. You may let him go . Don 't bite me ! Don 't bite me ! My friend just wanted to introduce himself . I just wanted to ask .. But what .. ? What happened to all men ? Right .. What have you done to all men ? It were not us . It was your acquaintance , Kuppelweiser . During the war , he invented a substance which ... temporarily paralized masculine genes . But something went wrong and the M-bomb ... instead of paralizing , liqudated masculine genes . Once and for all . So .. If the situation looks like this .. Maybe we could serve you somehow .. As those .. stud-males for breeding .. For the rebirth of men .. As long as we can .. Yes .. We have devoted ourselvs to human kind before , so .. And the payment .. we can postpone it .. After the whole session .. It can be together with the debt for the hibernation .. - Money aren 't that important . - What are they up to ? They want to bring back the past . The past ? The world with men ? This makes sense , doesn 't it ? Typically chauvinistic point of wiev . See ? This is our holy apple-tree ... planted by the Grand-Mother . It was from a tree like this one that a male took an apple ... and seduced a women with it . And this is why ... we lost the paradise , forever . That 's why today .. What happened to our holy apples ? ! They have profaned the nature sanctuary ! They have eaten our holy apples ! Holy ? These rotting apples were ' holy ' ? My little apples ! Who will bring them back to me ? What a disaster ! We didn 't realise they were so important for you ... and that they had a legend .. Besides ... they tasted sour anyway .. I 'm afraid , dear Berna , that what your women dug out ... is some kind of new Pandor 's box ! What ? Don 't call me like that , ok ? Take them away ! They have no right to leave ! Wait a minute ! Let us out , and I will buy you back your holy apples .. What ? ! Don 't touch me ! A women beat me .. I give up ! Just leave me alone ! And who is saying that ? Stand up ! I won 't stand up ! I 'll be lying down ! We have to escape ! As soon as possible . Where ? ! Haven 't you seen how it all is organized ! They will get us everywhere ! Escape is our duty ! How ? ! The door is electrified ! Underground ? A lamp is in the floor ! All is messed up ! Leave me alone ! We can 't think like that ! There must be somewhere another , better world ! A vacuum cleaner .. - I think I have an idea . - No kidding ? ' Take the pill ' We 've been here for eight days . And nothing is happening . I understand .. You 're on duty . Come over here . Where are you going ? What a nice vacuum cleaner you are .. What a nice mistress you have .. She 's only such a serious .. ' Why is she so serious ? ' ' What do you say ? Plumpkin .. ' ' Here you are .. Do you like dust-particles ? ' ' Eat . If you don 't eat your mistress will lock you ... ' ' in such a hole , like she locked us . ' And the air circulation is out of order . ' Be a good vacuum cleaner . ' Your authorisation , sister ? Lamia Reno , special assignement of Archeo . The purpouse of the visit ? I want to see the oldest of all grandmas . - Check which of them is the oldest . - Yes , sister . Everything 's changing from day to day . They 're dropping like flies . Anyway , it won 't be long .. Julia Novack , 74 years old , room 114 . You have half an hour . Merry Christmas ! ' I feel great . I am happy to live ... ' in the Eldest 's Asylum . I want to live my life to the happy end ... in this cosy place . It has broken again . Look what we have to work on .. Please , officer , don 't bother me . I don 't remember anything . I have amnesia . Don 't be afraid granny , they won 't hear us . I am not afraid . I have nothing to hide .. And what do we have here ? Have mercy , miss .. don 't look in there .. But this is forbidden ! Please , don 't take it away from me .. I was so happy that it has grown at last .. - What is that ? - A potato ! A real starch , no synthetics . I have something better here . Jam ? Strawberry ? You can have the whole jar if you tell me something . Can I taste it to check if it isn 't insipid ? Sour , good . What happened ? It 's the plug ! Keep an eye on them ! Watch them , I 'm going for a flashlight . Turn on the backup power ! Don 't move ! Not into the eyes ! Stay where you are ! What were men for ? Men ? What for ? Well , we used them .. mostly for work .. But I don 't remember anyway . How come you don 't ? In your times they were on daily basis .. Yes , daily and .. well , at night .. - What about the jam ? - It 's yours . I 'll tell you a secret . We buried out two of them , alive . Alive ? I 'm writing a work about them . They were hibernated in 1991 . That was the year .. Do you have the light ? No ? They were here a moment ago ! Maybe they 've hidden in the toilet ? They 're gone ! There they are ! Watch the lift ! Oh Jesus , exactly like my Juzus ! You said Jesus , what is Jesus ? I said Juzus . That was my fiancee 's name . What is ' fiancee ' ? What do you have from your , so called , feminity .. ? It 's not worth to be a woman if there are no men . What were they used for ? For entertainment .. Well , sort of .. Entertainment ? We have TV for it . They have something which doesn 't allow me to focus . I even find it fascinating .. Today , they were in my dream . Darling , aren 't you in love with one of them ? What do you want to do with them ? We want to table a motion for naturalisation . What ? Do you want to turn them into women ? But for them it is worse than death ! Such chance to make things normal .. If I were younger , I would do everything to save them ! You 're not like the rest of them , are you ? - What is your name ? - Lamia .. - And ? - They 're not there . - Neither in the lift . I don 't know .. What is that wood doing here ? I 'll check again . You stay here . This tool was for making cut wounds . This is how males tortured women . Male - your enemy ! What this tool was for , sisters , I don 't have to explain , do I ? Special section - always loyal ! After this , dear sisters , you will understand ... why our grandmothers couldn 't stand this any more ... and founded The League ! The League - Power , Wisdom , Loyality ! Excuse us .. Please , continue .. We 'll be going .. The idea was quite good . Yes , but we should have turned left .. I 'm beginning to like it . Tomorrow we will escape again ! Although you offended Her Majesty very much , and , by your unpredictable behaviour , damaged our electrical grid , we are willing ... to give you one last chance . What are we supposed to do ? Just sign that application . To the Comitee of Species ' Purity Control . I declare that I was born as a man , which was against my will . Therefore , I ask to forget all my deeds done as a male , because I was acting under the influence of ... the former , misleading , chauvinistic civilisation . I also consider it a fact that ... men never existed , there are no men , and we don 't need them . Could you , please , read it for me again ? If I were you , I would treat it seriously and sign . - What if we don 't sign it ? - Do sign it . You will stand at the gathering which will decide what to do with you . Women 's Gathering ! Thank you very much . I 'm not moving from here . Your turn . Sit down . All talkings can be conducted only ... after we have been released from here . Actually , we might have signed it . In this situation any solicitor would successfully defend us . What about the principles ? Your turn . Interesting opening .. Take cover ! The door ! To the toilet ! Barricade ! Hold it ! Hold it ! Hold .. What a rubbish quality .. I protest ! In the name of science .. ! I 'm not going ! It hurts ! Firstly , I apologise for my being late . My watch broke down . I remind : The content of this meeting , as well as its results , is strictly confidential . Today we have two points of discussion . Both of them are sitting there . Now , that looks seriously . It is some kind of an organisation . Dr Berna has the floor . We met here today , sisters , to decide ... about the future of those two persons - of the second kind , who , instead of becoming extinct in the course of evolution , in strange circumscances appeared here among us . I 'd like to present the point of view of Archeo ... as the last , because we have the most info on the case . Who would like to start ? I think there is little field to debate . Already in the past , our grandmothers pointed ... the direction of the path we 're happily walking on . We will not let the situation to come back , in which ... a woman is a waitress on the life-party of men . Never again ! Male - your enemy ! Currently , we firmly stand on the ground that will allow us ... to stop the spread of the desease called ' man ' , the desease we all are immune to . Aren 't you exagerrating ? Hadn 't it been for men , the world wouldn 't have moved forward ! History of progress is the history of men ! You can 't deny it ! All the great scientist , fathers of progress , humanists , - ... inventors , they were men ! - Which of them ? Give the names ! Copernicus ! It 's a lie ! Copernicus was a woman ! What ? How about Einstein ! Einstein was a women too ! How about Curie-Sklodowska ? As well ? - Not the best example .. - They confused me .. Sorry .. They are talking about men 's inventions . So , what is it that they invented ? Let 's start from the very beginning . A male named Cain invented crime ... and tried it on his sister , Abel . Another male invented prostitution , and others slavery , cowardice , laziness .. To put it shortly , we owe you all the evil of this world ... From religious wars to the womb cancer . Yeah , we 're not responsible only for hailstorm , earthquakes and the whooping cough ! Our world is better than the one they remember .. Why are they critisizing it ? Are you ill ? Recently you have thought way too often . Organism in good health lives and acts . Only the one in bad health thinks of itself . As we can see , we manage to live without them . We 're living in a righteous , stable world , without famine , wars , venereal diseases , and other inventions of men . Do you have anything to say to stand up for yourself ? - What now ? - You must speak to them . This coincidence , in our persons , gives you a rare opportunity of coming back to the natural order . You 've been working on those test tubes for half a century ... not even knowing what you have missed . In our world you were on the top ! Everyone courted you , loved you , threw flowers at your feet . You were good muses of poets , symbol of higher ideas , beauty . By destroying the world 's manly half , you have destroyed a half of yourselves ! Don 't rape the eternal right of nature ! What you are saying makes no sense . A poor provocation . I know ! You 've gone crazy because you haven 't got laid ! What you need is a man ! I 'll sit by myself ! What does it mean , to get laid ? Probably that is men 's house service , quite popular in the 20th century . If that is all they had to say , take them out sisters . They 'll wait for the voting results in the corridor . Great speech . This is how we should talk with them . I feel as if I were being thrown out of bloody Scouts .. ' Take the pill ' On behalf of Archeo , I apply for naturalisation of the males . As the head of Genetics , I feel obliged to ... warn you , dear sisters , against the outcomes of that ... humanitarian whim of dr Berna . On no account can thay be incorporated ... into our society . Both of them should be liquidated ASAP , and before that passed over to Genetix ... for certain interesting biomedical experiments . I object ! My dear colleague purpously exaggerates ... the danger form the males only to ... raise the prestge of her duty and to gain ... additional sources for her shady experiments . I protest ! It 's insinuation ! Genetics is the most important of all sciences , no matter if someone likes it or not ! - Oh really ? - Stop it , sisters ! Show some respect for that gathering . So , we have two projects for voting . Who supports liquidation , who supports naturalisation ? Let us vote . What the .. ? Steady ? Run ! What is going on here ? ! What ? Alarm ! They 're escaping ! - Drop it ! - My leg ! To the lift ! Which button ? Ground floor ! But nr 1 is on the top .. We 're moving .. - Good work , Max .. - That was nothing . We must get them , no matter what . Naturalisation - 155 , against 154 . Bring in the subjects . It seems that something is burning ! Help ! The males .. They 've escaped ! What ? They pulled out the gas plug ! Why are they running ? Everything , in the end , is alright ! Didn 't I tell you ? I warned you they were dangerous ! Alarm for the north-east area ! Send the code , over ! GS18447 , ON70946 , roger ! 100 ! No implulse ! 75 ! No impulse ! 50 ! No impulse ! 25 ! Receiving weak impulses ! Up or down ? Down .. Excuse me .. Maybe I shall leave .. Why are you staring like that , sisters ? I 'm only 2 kg overweight .. Max ! We 're on the run ! Have you forgot where we are ? Come on ! What is going on here ! What is it , sisters ? ! On the swimming pool ... with the clothes on ? Excuse us , we were lost .. Clothes off in the lift ! I just can 't make it out ! A man with a naked woman in a lift , and they cannot simply .. When will this spooky scy-scraper finish ? - We have the impulses ! - Broader the range ! - The clear impulses ! - We 've got them ! They 're on the level 3 . Genetix Prim to the group , over ! Excuse me , where is hotel " Intercontinental " ? We 're just passing by . I just had this feeling , sister , that those Genetix girls .. Is this their hatchery ? - They multiply here . - Yes .. That 's what I meant . Is anybody there ? - Look ! - A lift ! We 're going .. The ground floor ? - It feels like colder here .. - Pleasntly .. What is that ? Fresh air ! We must be close to the exit . No , on the contrary ! It 's some kind of a bloody mine . My earing is giving sounds . I feel impulses ! The unit - get out ! Move it ! Today you have 15 meters to dig . You will forget about that decance ! What are you doing here ? We didn 't call for Archeo . Nothing has been found . We were thinking .. We were told to come here . No , it is a misunderstanding . Really ? In that case , nice job , sisters ! Do you think we have nothing to do ? ! It is your fault ! I can see a nice mess in here ! What have you just said ? You have a mess in your Archeo ! You all are one big excavation ! It 's blocked .. Carefull ! Just a rubber-shoe . Our folks were here ! Our professor ! A newspaper from ' 93 ! The protest of China causes dissolution of the UN ? The indebtment of the USA ! Alaska sold to .. Holy Mary ! The M-Bomb in mass production ! What is this ? Who 's there ? Back up ! I cover you ! ... corridor 40 A. Cut their way ! Get in ! Hold me ! - It must be another country . - At last .. This place is nice . Look ! - Come on ! - No ! Carefully ! They are all women , as well . Came to spy ? Archeo sisters ! They are ... different ! We .. Comepletely .. diff .. Let 's go ! Alarm ! Take cover ! Max ! Must be a new decadency camp . We destroy one and another takes its place . What are they up to ? Watch for the child ! Max ! Albert ! Stop it .. ! We 've encountered a decadency camp ! Send backup ! - Hooray for cookies ! - Down with the earings ! You will never catch all of us ! C 'mon ! C 'mon ! Albert ! We 're leaving this party ! Albert ! Where are you ? Albert .. Why did you do this to me ? My old mate ! What is she doing here ? You wanted to go outside . So this is where we are going . I don 't believe you . Please , we have to trust her ! I 'll show you the entrance . I really wish you well . Let 's go .. Lamia Reno , 63-64 Archeo ! - Where are we ? - In the C-Blockhouse . Look ! What is that ? The surface , where you wanted escape ! How could one allow this to happen ? ! Wait a second ! Does it mean that all this time we 've been underground ? 365 meters under . I knew it ! Damn , I could feel this from the start ! Couldn 't we .. at least for a while .. to go out ? Today there is more than 300 degrees out there . Degrees ? Of what ? Of Kuppelweiser 's radiation . A side effect of the M-Bomb . This is why our ancestors had to go to live in mines . Then they broadened the station-town to the today 's shape . This means .. One will never be able to go out ? To live there ? Never . Naturalisation is the only option for you . There must be some safe way of getting out of here ! You have to go out sometimes , to fix this equipement at least ! There are anti-radiation suits . But there is only an hour amount of oxygen ! - Doesn 't matter , where are those suits ? - But there you will die after 12 days ! Better two weeks there than the whole life here , like moles .. - You 'll get used to ! - Never ! Where is the exit ? You didn 't think I would help you to escape , did you ? I am a loyal federal officer ! You might have been such a fine girl , Lamia .. I have no choice . Treason ! We 're surrounded ! Lamia ! I won 't forget that ! But I 'll return and take revenge ! Bravo , your idea was great . You deserved the promotion . - You earned it . - Thank you . One more thing . Pass over all you got about the males to Emma . Why ? Along with dr Tekla , we will countinue your work . They are more dangerous than we had thought . Thus , we have to take care of them . Don 't worry.We 'll enable you the insight into the outcomes of our observation . What outcomes ? I 've written a whole work about them ! Of course , we will use it ! I wouldn 't smile so much if I were you . It causes wrinkles . What are they going to do with us ? Soon , you can call me ' my darling ' .. I 'd rather die than become a woman ! We thougth so . You chose death to naturalisation . Once , you said you wanted to devote your lives for science . We will make this possible . Some of our sisters , on high posts , are a bit old and tired . Your fresh , healthy and strong organs will bring them the second youth . Please , call dr Ossa . That kidney will be there today . And the remains , we will try to make into a nutritious substance . In our world , proteins are more and more difficult to get . Maybe the cremation of those who passed away is a prodigality .. The experiment we 're going to make thanks to you ... will be crucial for our food programme . It 's cannibalism ! I hope you will choke on us ! You hags ! Good luck , my dear . See you later . To you I say goodbye , for surely I won 't see you again . How can it be ? ! It 's impossible ! It is impossible ! It 's against all principles ! It 's inhumane ! I protest ! - Albert , don 't leave me alone ! - Thank you , my friend ! Don 't leave me alone ... Long live men , Max ! Stop shouting mr Paradys or I will gag you . How do you know my name ? ! You man-eater ! Who in August 1991 did walk away from a wife and a kid ? How do you know abot it ? Cause I am that child ! My little Jadwinia ? I have nothing in common with you ! I even changed my name ! Yes .. You are a bit similar to your mother .. You don 't even speak her name ! A poor victim of your manly atrocities ! And you , my daughter , against your daddy ? I used to carry you on my back , pat on your little bottom .. Don 't you remember ? It was with me that you had the happiest times of your childhood .. The childhood I 've never had , because you chose to get hibernated ... instead staying with me and mommy . But now there are no fathers ! And we will make sure that they will never be there again ! Get it ? ! Jadwinia ! Untie your daddy and apologise ! - Doctor ? The patient is ready . - I 'm coming . And you will be my dessert ! Daddy ! No , no , thist can 't be true ! Somebody pinch me ! Aaaaa ... Will I be a woman after this ? Anaesthesia .. Great .. Should I count from 100 to 1 ? Have an eye on him , sister . Scalpel . What is going on ? ! Who knocked the scalpel from my hand ? ! Look at it ! It 's dirty ! Never mind .. This is the punishment , my dear daughter . Dr Janda fainted ! The patient is gone ! The door is blocked ! We don 't have time ! To the lift ! Albert , I beg you .. - Act like a man ! Stop goofing , wake up ! A woman , a woman ... . What are you doing to him ? Do you want him to wake up ? The experiment is over . Oh God .. We made it .. Yes we did ! Like a hell ! Or better ! You have no idea what dream I had ! But what a dream I had ! What kind of dream ? In my dream we woke up in a world without men ! Only women ? - And , could you believe , they reproduced by test tubes .. - Underground ? - How do you know ? - It was in my dream too ! And they wanted , excuse my language , to castrate us ! Professor , is there a scientific explanation on such a dreamy coincidence ? It 's interesting , but .. absolutely impossible . It 's so good it was just a dream .. He 's awake ! I had such a beautiful dream .. It 's ok . Stop crying . What is she doing here ? She betrayed us ! And now she 's helping us to escape . Why are you doing this ? They took away you and my work , so they won 't get anything . What if they catch us again ? They won 't take us alive . You have to get rid of that ! Those are the ID earings . It 's going to hurt a bit . We got them ! The impulses are coming from this lift . The impulses come from this .. What a shame ! To let those males escape from the operation tables .. Now dr Tekla will show us .. Maybe it is high time for you to think about an asylum , sister ? Somebody must have helped them .. Give me the location of Lamia Reno . How about doing some work ? Come on ! You have to see this ! Is it you again , Lamia ? What happened ? Let me in , I think I left my transmitter . Come quickly so that the supervisers won 't see you . It 's only a while and I 'm gone . What are you .. ? ! Watch out , sister ! You will blow us up ! We will ! If you don 't cooperate ! Take off your clothes ! Quickly ! Move it ! Lamia , why .. ? It 's gonna blow ! Take it off . - Face to the wall ! - Turn around ! Receiving impulses . Lamia Reno , C-Blockhouse ! I knew it .. - Head for the C-Blockhause ! - Yes , sister . Now , the suits ! Hurry ! We can 't without Her Majesty 's authorisation .. Besides , today there is over 300 degrees out there ! I count to three ! One ! Two ! Lamia , open up . We know you 're here ! Get the laser . Lamia , give up the males ! ' Think whom are you helping ! ' Once we 're in , it will be to too late ! Hurry up , Lamia .. Lamia , can you hear me ? Why isn 't it coming down ? - Why won 't it come down ? - A malfunction ? They must have given a wrong key ! What is it ? Why doesn 't it work ? ! - The acoustic password is needed ! - What password ? ! - We have no idea ! - Only Her Majesty knows it ! You 're lying to gain time ! The password ! You have five seconds ! - Don 't blow us up ! - We really don 't know it ! Lamia , think whom are you helping ! They are men ! Why won 't they let us go ? We would die there peacefully .. It 's all gone .. FUCK ! You made it ! - They knew the password ! - What did it mean ? Here it is . We made it . Courage , Albert ! Be brave now ! Hurry up now ! Run ! We will die free ! Thank you Lamia ! Come with us ! I belong here . Anyway , I want to see their faces .. You are a great girl . Thank you for your efforts ! Well , here come the two weeks ! ' When we have got in there , it will be too late for you ! ' Don 't move ! Lamia , can you hear me ? - We could 't do anything ! - She said she would blow the whole blockhaus ! And who let her in ? We 'll talk about it later . Now , quickly the suits ! They can 't be far ! Well done ! You made it ! The first manly decision in your life ! But what next ? The desert ! - What 's wrong ? - I don 't know .. Are you ok , Max ? I 'm fed up with that underground blindman 's-buff ! Are you ok , Max ? I don 't know yet ! It must be some preventive filter .. It is fake . But why did they put so much effort ? I think I have already been here .. Is it already the outer space ? Be carefull ! It may be contaminated ! Why are you standing ? There are no more suits .. Bad luck .. I 'll follow them anyway . I 'll be in touch by radio . Go after me when you find more suits . I 've found something very strange ! I have visual contact ! A forest ! The green coluor of a forest ! Stay alert ! This may be artificial ! Lamia , stay close ! Slow down .. Should we really care where we 're going to die ? We have oxygen just for two minutes .. This is beautiful .. It was worth all the while .. He 's gone mad ! We 're safe ! A stork ! Look , a stork ! If it can live , we can as well ! A stork .. Get it off ! Lamia , get off that funny hat ! Let 's go , the nest must be here somewhere ! Get it off ! You will suffocate ! Listen , they 've gone mad . They 're suiciders ! They 've taken off the suits ! I 'm going after them ! How could you live in such draughts ? - Is this some kind of station of yours ? - I don 't know . Give me a hand . Unbelievable .. What the hell is there ? See for yourselves . It must be some blockhouse .. We have travelled in time once again .. God .. This is a hallucination .. Well , we 're home . Is this a house of your times ? Exactly . Second half of the 20th cantury . It 's real ! It 's all real ! HQ ! Over ! HQ ! What 's going on ? Her you are . The breakfast is ready . Let us eat . Maybe it is just a museum ? And all this is just an exposition .. What museum ? Everything 's freh . - Miss Lamia , would you start ? - Here you are . Poor baby got messy .. Throw it .. An egg must be .. Only the shell taken off .. - Cause it popped .. - Oh .. Never mind , it 's ok . What a mess .. Take off these gloves . Coffe will be in a minute . I didn 't expect that eating may be so pleasant . Talking of pleasure .. You will get to know much more pleasure , my dear ; ) Put your hands up ! You 're under arrest ! In the name of .. Her Majesty .. She 's run out of the oxygen . So , about the egg .. I like it most when it is boiled .. She 's taken too much care about that . Now we have to cut this .. It is a la Vienna .. Don 't be shy Albert ! Mouth-to-mouth ! We may throw this away , and here you have the yolk . You could mak a use of a good bed ! I 'm just rescueing ! Yeah , right .. I underestimated you ! A shy guy ! Excuse me .. So when the butter has melted , it 's excellent . - I 'm just rescueing ! - But I haven 't said anything ! Where am I ? Where is my suit ? Why are you stripping me ? I want back to HQ ! They will save us ! Maybe you , but not us .. Anyway , there is no radiation ! What do you mean ? Our equipement is most reliable ! You can die if you want , I 'm going back ! Stay ! You were lied to , cheated on ! There is no radiation ! Haven 't you seen the animals , flowers , birds ? ' ... died for the motherland . Emma Dax from Genetix and ... ' They 've made us dead ? It 's impossible .. See ? They gave up on you too . Impossible ! ' I 'd like to say that both males were buried out and dehibernated . ' ' However , there is no danger since this morning in the Archeo 's clinics ... ' ' both of them had been naturalised , to help those creatures ... ' - ' ... with adaptation in our society . Here they are . ' - What ? This is a big lie ! ' ... because , belonging to the lower evolutioin class , ' I might have been a threat for other people . ' ' I feel good as well and I 'd like to express my gratitude to ... ' ' the team of surgeons for ... ' - Why are they lying ? - For the higher idea . But this is diguisting ! Why should they worry the whole society ? You just don 't do such things to others ! They 're lying ! - I don 't want .. ! I don 't .. - Don 't you want me to touch you ? Yes .. No .. I dont know .. Let 's see what 's upstairs . - Should I touch you or not ? - Yes .. No .. Whose place is this ? Ah , I con 't care . Let 's go ! I don 't know ! There 's too much air in here .. I want back to HQ .. ! Calm the hell down ! Or I 'll spank you on the ass ! I don 't know what 's happening to me .. Beautiful .. Late rocococo .. : ) It is hot today , isn 't it ? Yes , it is . It 's so pleasantly cool .. In the present situation , that you and me are here , as the representatives of two sexes in any way .. As a humanist ... I 'd like to propose coming back to ... the more traditional method of contact ... between two persons of the opposite sex . What are you doing ? I am a federal officer . Now you are not an officer , you are a woman . Step by step we 're getting close the great mystery of the nature . You 're making big steps .. The last of them will be a small one for a human ... but for the humanity it may be the huge one . I 'd like to propose .. I 'd like to propose the sexual intercourse .. - What do you mean ? - See how unexperienced you are ? - I attended three seminars ! - Your seminars .. Well .. You have your test tubes , right ? I was thinking of another , more direct method .. How to explain it .. Like two animals , for instance .. Well , I love you very much ! Love - a kind of psychical intoxication used by men to ... posses woman 's soul .. Come here .. - What is this ? - It 's life . What 's so funny in there ? It 's the beginning of a new world . What if it 's going to be girls ? Don 't even say like that ! A boy every 9 months .. Well .. Two of them . What if it 's going to be twins ? Damn .. It 's not enough .. Don 't bother yourself ! That world is already lost . Here someone made a cosy place .. Max , It has to be done on mass scale ! Sexplosion .. ! We 'll defeat them with their own weapon . What do you mean ? - What was that ? - A lift ! A lift ? Here ? - I 've heard a lift ! - Where ? Hello birds .. Your mistress will give you something to eat in a minute ! You will get some too . Somone was drinking from my glass .. Someone was sitting on my sofa .. Strange .. Good morning ! Is Jolka in the house ? Get her ! Nooo ! Gentlemen ! What is that ! ? Gentlemen ! I 'm begging you .. ! I 'll do anythig ! Please , don 't give me in ! So you are that kind of Majesty ? We were that close from being castrated ... and you have made yourself a pair of boobs , you rascal ? ! ? ! Gentlemen , I couldn 't .. believe me .. I had to be more ruthless than they were ! Otherwise , they would have noticed something ! Hey man ! How did you manage to survive ? A long story .. After the war had ended , when the league took over the power , I was 4 years old . These few boys who survived ... were naturalised into girls . My mother had hidden me . and so I grew up in girl 's clothes . Then I started a career in the League , and then , ten years ago they chose me for Their Majesty . Only then could I feel relieved and ... organise an apartament in my mother 's house . There are tousands of women underground , who are being lied to ! They must be freed ! There is not any radiation ! It wasn 't as intensive as we thought . They panicked at first , but since they started to live underground ... it was no use in straighting things up . They are easier to manage when they are underground . But what happened to the sexual impulse ? The League had thouht about everything . A speciall pill transferred sexual impulse into the career impulse . And you enjoyed your privilidges , instead of .. bringing up some lady and starting to fix the world ? - Even if I wanted , it wouldn 't work anyway .. - Why ? - This is my life 's greatest tragedy .. - What is it ? I have always been so shy with women .. They simply scare me off ! What are we going to do with him ? After all , he is a man .. Well , we cannot give him to those witches .. Ok , here 's the deal : We won 't give you in and we can live here . Deal ! I 'm so happy , guys . Feel like at home ! Great job on swindling those hags ! I 'll show you something . This is my command centre . Well , well .. Nice thing . We 're going to rule , command .. We can rotate .. Who 's there ? There are two girls with us , but tey 're staying too . - Two ? - Yes , just two of them , This is Your Majesty ! Tommorow is a free day ! I announce a national holiday ! An invention . Well , let 's do it . When a legion of you will have been born , noone will stop you from spreading on . Sleep well , dear boys .. You are our only hope . See you in nine months ! Mother nature is on our side ! Take care , guys ! The law of nature has to win . It is just a matter of time . THE END

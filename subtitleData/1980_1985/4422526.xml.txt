Mr. White , how long should we hold the front page ? Give it another 1 0 minutes , and- - Oh , I 'll tell them . - Sorry . Thank you . - Hello , Pete . If we don 't get anything new in 1 0 minutes go with the wire-service copy and run the picture in three columns . I need a story for the page-three sidebar on this terrorist group . Right . Sorry , terrorists ? Get your head out of the clouds , Kent . Where you been ? - I was at home . - Don 't you watch television ? I don 't enjoy television . Too much violence . I was just reading Dickens . Mr. Kent , a gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris . He knows where the Eiffel Tower is , Olsen . - You do , don 't you ? - Yes , sir . - Has anybody been hurt ? - So far the hostages are unharmed . - The hostages ? - Yeah , tourists . About 20 of them . But that 's just penny-ante stuff . They claim if the government doesn 't meet their demands they 've got a hydrogen bomb . Mr. White , that 's terrible . That 's why they call them terrorists , Kent . - Now , get to the morgue . I wanna know everything on terrorism . Mr. White , does Lois know about any of this ? - Does she know about it ? She 's in it . - She 's what ? The minute the story broke , I bundled her on the first Concorde . If Paris is gonna go kablooey , I want my best reporter there . - But , gee , Mr. White- - - You 're good , but Lois Lane is better . No , I meant , isn 't that a little bit dangerous , sir ? That goes with the territory , Kent . Don 't worry . If I know Lois Lane , she 'll not only come back with a Pulitzer Prize story but a one-on-one interview with a hydrogen bomb titled " What Makes Me Tick . " Now , don 't stand around , Kent- - [ DRIVER AND LOIS SPEAK IN FRENCH ] - How did they get up there ? - They were disguised as repair workers . Can you tell us why they released the first hostages ? We insist they do this to show good faith . If not , we refuse to negotiate . - Will they release the rest of the hostages ? In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack on them . - There will be no attack , no attempt to overpower the terrorists ? - We 've made a guarantee . - And you 'll honor it ? We have not the choice to refuse if we believe it 's a real hydrogen bomb they have . - Where is the bomb ? - It 's in a big oilcan . Hydrogen bomb ? Are you sure ? How can we be sure ? Today it 's possible for anyone to make a bomb . This could blow up all of Paris . - What 's the government 's position ? Will they meet their demands ? I am not authorized to say what they will do . At this moment , there is an emergency meeting in the Elysée Palace . Wait . Wait , wait . - Stairs . Stairs ? Stairs . - Stairs . Okay ? - All right .

Okay , send them down . Okay , up we go . Pulitzer Prize . Capital P- - Darn . Should we have let the hostages go ? They 'll give in to us as soon as we plant the bomb . It doesn 't matter one way or the other . Nobel Prize . Capital N little O , little B little E , little L. Nobel . Nobel . Nobel . Prize . Now , be careful . It 's me that controls the bomb , not the bomb that controls me . I hope you have not many sins left to be forgiven because if you let go of that , you 'll only have 60 seconds to list them . - You are right . - Did you hear something ? - Sounded like someone moving underneath . It 's your nerves . - Where are they now ? - They are near to the lift . But one is still inside with the bomb . The third one has come out of the lift now . - The third one is out now . - The bomb , is it still in there ? Yes , we think so . This is the boring bit . Tell them to get ready . Stand by . Get ready . Come on . We 'll cut the cable as soon as we get the word . - Are you sure they haven 't primed the bomb ? No , no , of course not . They haven 't . We 've been watching them all the time . Now ! - It started . - Oh , my God . I believe this is your floor . Oh , thank God . How did I get myself into this ? - You all right ? - Uh-huh . A bomb ! There 's a bomb up there . - They 've got a bomb . - I know . I know . Nice fresh melons . Nice fresh melons . Get them fresh here . Good for the cooking , huh ? Look at this , the best . - Hi , Lois . - Hi , Clark . Hey ! Clark . - You ever heard of crosswalks ? - Yeah , but you know , I mean ... Do you have any idea how stupid that was ? Freak . Clark , you know , you were really lucky that time . You gotta be careful . When you cross the street , look both ways . Well , I mean , gee , Lois , usually I do , you know . - Come in . - Hi . You know , maybe you ought to get your glasses checked . Uh , well , you know , not everybody can have x-ray vision , you know , Lois . Do I detect a note of jealousy in that voice ? Jealousy ? No , no . Not me . Golly , Lois , what are you doing ? - When was the last time you heard me sneeze ? You are never gonna hear me sneeze again . - No ? - No . I read this book and it says that if you get 1 000 milligrams of vitamin C every day you stay in perfect health . Golly , 1 000 ? That 's certainly a lot of oranges , isn 't it , Lois ? - There are pills . I 've seen them . - Pills . That 's the modern way to do things . This is natural . Besides , I get my exercise that way . And , Clark , you don 't have to be jealous . - Uh , I don 't ? - No , you got so much going for you . I do ? Do you mind if I give you a little constructive criticism ? - Well , actually , yes , I- - - You gotta be more aggressive . You have to go from the instinct . You see something , you want it , you go for it . That 's what I do . Yes , I 've noticed . Perhaps I could help you there . Oh , thanks . That would be great . Let me see now ... Oh , I see . Just put the orange in there . That 's really very clever . Clark . You know that I wouldn 't say all those things to you if I didn 't really care . - You do ? - Mm-hm . I mean , what else are friends for ? - Friends , huh ? - Mm-hm . Here , Clark . Here 's to friendship . Hm . This is how it ends for the greatest criminal mind of our time . Not with a whimper , not with a bang . How do they choose to reward Lex Luthor the greatest genius in this world ? Do they give him glory or treasure ? What , matter of fact , do they give him ? Life plus 25 , Luthor . Get to work . Don 't feel bad , Mr. Luthor . It almost worked . I mean , California almost fell down , right in the ocean . Millions of people was almost killed . If it hadn 't been for that guy Superman , that overgrown Boy Scout . - I want my Liberace record back tonight . - There 's a scratch on it . What are you gonna do with a guy like that ? He flies around so fast and everything . I mean , they can 't even trace that guy on that radar they got . Every time they try , he just flies off . - Where ? - North . Why ? To ski ? Otis , every man has his vulnerable point . Some , like you , Otis , have more than one . I didn 't see Superman 's in time . But now , through patience , invention , and skill my little black box is just about ready . - Oh , that little black box in our cell ? - Shh ! That little black box , Mr. Luthor what 's it for ? That little black box , Otis , goes beyond any conventional radar . - It tracks alpha waves . - Oh . Alpha waves . Hm . Those alpha waves will take me north to his secret . And his secret will give me Superman . The MAB is 1 96 at 0.5 . We ought to see the old beauty when we top the rise there . - Follow the bouncing ball for a while . It 's giving me a headache .

Well , we really- - Artemis , come in , please . Houston calling . What was that he said before ? He saw a girl ? - I thought he said " curl . " - What 's a curl ? Isn 't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet with an east-west trajectory ? How should I know ? I was back in high school in those days . Strange . I tore those metal fibers like paper . And what he did was amazing . - Something is happening . - Yes , to all of us .

How am I supposed to get a Pulitzer Prize writing about a pink bear ? I don 't know , I think this kind of thing should be exposed . They get kids who are just starting out , and take them for every cent . - That 's what Mr. White says . - Yeah ? On the other hand , this is kind of nice . Complimentary champagne . - Kissing contest tonight . - Really ? Lois , would ... ? Uh ... No . Hey , look at this . Lois ? Gee . Look what I found . A complimentary corsage .

Well , um , I was thinking primarily about the , um sleeping arrangements . - Mr . Smith ? - Uh-huh . - The complimentary couch . - Right . What ? Oooh . Gosh , it 's alive . Very good , Miss Teschmacher . Very good . Why am I here ? What am I doing here ? Miss Teschmacher , is this a philosophy seminar ? No . This is a getaway . - Getaway . - Right .

Yes , gorgeous . Gorgeous . - Lois ? - Yeah ? Look . Everybody 's holding hands . Maybe we should hold hands too , huh ? - Here 's my hand , Clark . Hold it . - Thanks . You know what ? They 're afraid to let go . - Why ? - They let go , straight to the lawyer . Oh , I don 't know about that . They look kind of happy to me . That 's because you 're blind , Clark . - Oh , yeah . - Here . - No , I 've got it . No , I- - - Yeah . Clark . You 've gotta look after yourself .

Excuse me , please . - Be careful . - What are you doing ? Get down ! Get down ! You embarrass me here in front of everybody . Lois , did you see what almost happened there ? That little boy- - Hey , I 'm hungry . You hungry ? - Lois , you 're amazing . - Why , because I 'm hungry ? No . Here you are standing in front of one of nature 's most awesome spectacles and you 're thinking about food . Aren 't you impressed ? Clark , once a girl 's seen Superman in action Niagara Falls kind of leaves you cold , you know ? Him again , huh ? Oh , I 'm sorry . I have a one-track mind , don 't I ? Well , my one-track mind is telling me that I 'm hungry . - Hot dog ? - Hot dog . Hot dog . Could I have some orange juice ? - Freshly squeezed . - Freshly squeezed , I know . Okay . Hey , Mom . Look ! Yeah , honey . That 's nice . Okay , it 's two mustard and relish , and ... Oh , my God ! Help ! Somebody help ! Somebody do something ! Way to go , Superman ! - What a nice man .

You 're gonna get it ! - Give me a heart attack here . - It 's me . It 's Lois . Lois Lane . Well , hello and goodbye . What 's the hurry ? I mean , seeing as you happen to be in Niagara Falls ? Happen to be in Niagara Falls . And Clark ... Clark is not around , as usual . Hmm . Lois ? Hey , Lois ? - Here you go . - Where were you ? I was getting hot dogs . What do you mean ? Well , it just seems kind of strange to me that every time Superman 's around you disappear . Superman ? You mean he was here ? - Golly . - And you weren 't . As usual . So , what have you got to say about that ? Darn , I forgot your orange juice . Clark . No orange juice ? Mush ! Mush ! I am mushing . Ice and snow . Is this your idea of a good time ? - A good time ? Is that all you care about ? North , Miss Teschmacher . North . North , north , north ! Yes , Lex . North . Look . It 's his home . It 's Superman 's home . Oh , good , more ice . - Fantastic . - Fantastic . It 's fantastic ! The construction goes far beyond any known architectural theory . - It 's beautiful . - Beautiful . - This place is genius . - Genius . - Lex . - I 'll be all right . No , me . Oh ! Ah ! Why can 't you be more careful ? - It 's beautiful . - Beautiful . - It has everything . - Wrong . - Why didn 't you go before we left ? - That was two days ago . - This looks like some kind of control panel . - Don 't touch anything . - Don 't touch anything . - Ice . - I said , don 't touch it . - It 's not ice . - It looks like a crystal . - Kryptonian memory bank . Education crystal number 308 . - I told you it 's a crystal . - Shut up . Earth culture , section B. Trees by Joyce Kilmer of the Planet Earth . What 's this ? I think that I shall never see A poem lovely as a tree . - A tree whose hungry mouth ... - He 's not here . It 's a voice from the past . That 's cute . That 's very cute . A tree that looks at God all day- - I like trees . So does your average cocker spaniel . Give me another one . No , no , no . The big one there . Kal-El , my son as keeper of the archives of Krypton it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planet 's history . Now , this I wanna hear . After eons of harmony , there appeared among us three rebel elements . What you would call on Earth " criminals . " Criminals . My kind of people . Despite all our efforts , we were unable to change their evil natures their evil ways . And as you know , we had no death penalty . - Sensible enough . - Therefore our scientists constructed the Phantom Zone . In it , we placed these three arch criminals imprisoning them there for all eternity . No possibility for parole ? Your father , Jor-El , thought long and hard upon that question . - I asked the right question . - And there is one danger . The Phantom Zone might just might , be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space . I wish you had not asked me that . I didn 't ask anything . We do not know what would happen if they were to escape . On Krypton , these villains were uncontrollable . On Earth , they would have the same powers , each one of them that you have . - Think of it . - The first of the three ... - Three . - ... is their leader , General Zod . - Three super villains . - Together with Non and Ursa- - Each one with the same power he has . Each one totally dedicated to corruption , violence and evil . That explains the three alpha waves I 've been getting on my black box . They 'll need a contact on Earth . Someone with the same contempt for life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . South , Miss Teschmacher . You know , it 's really amazing . I never started to put it together before now . It 's just kind of funny , because a good reporter doesn 't let anything slip by her . No , of course not . Well , I 'm beginning to get the picture . As usual , Lois , I really don 't know what you 're talking about . Tell you what , I 'll meet you back at the hotel . What 's your hurry , Superman ? Sorry ? I gotta admit , your disguise is nearly perfect . You had me fooled . And I am nobody 's fool , believe me . No , of course not , Lois . I mean , you just have an active imagination . You just get carried away sometimes . - I understand . It can happen to anybody . - Listen . I 'm so sure that you 're Superman , that I 'm willing to bet my life on it . What ? Now , if I 'm right , you 'll turn into Superman . And if I 'm wrong you 've got yourself one hell of a story . You think I 'm Superman ? Boy , you certainly have some imagination , Lois . For a minute you almost had me convinced . For a minute . Bye-bye , baby . Oh , my God ! Excuse me , please . Superman ! Lois , swim . Swim ! Help ! Look out for the rocks ! Oh , God . Clark ! Lois , grab the branch ! What ? Help ! Lois , you all right ? I gotcha . Here , here , here ! Clark ! You 're what I thought was Superman ? Sorry . This is really embarrassing . So this is planet Houston . A very strange surface . A primitive sort of life form . Hm ... Did you see that ? Did you see what I did ? I have powers beyond reason here . We all have them , my dear . Boy , I sure must have looked like an idiot . Jumping in the river , waiting for Mr. Wonderful who obviously had better things to do . Well , I 'm sure it must have been something very important , Lois . And then thinking that you were ... If Perry White could see me now . Where 's my comb ? God , not only have I lost my mind , I 've lost my comb . Clark , can you pass me that brush over there , please ? Sure . Clark ! - No , no , no . It 's okay . - Let me see your hand . Give it to me . - No , no . It 's all right , Lois . - Let me look at it . - You are Superman . - Lois , come on . Don 't be s- - I 'm sorry . No , you don 't have anything to be sorry about . I don 't know why I did that . Maybe you wanted to . I don 't think I did . Well , maybe you didn 't want to with your mind but maybe you wanted to with your heart . We 'd better talk . I 'm in love with you . Well , we really better talk . I 'm listening . We can 't talk here . Perry will call at about 6 to find out what 's happening . " What 's happening " ? That 's the understatement of the year . Where do you wanna talk ? Lois . Now that you know , I think you should know it all . I want to . Let 's go to my place . Maybe I should change first . Maybe you should too . - They have a wide selection . - I can 't eat fish . You can eat anything you want , Duane . You can eat meat and potatoes . I couldn 't go anywhere where I was expected to eat fish . They got beans . I can 't eat beans . I 'll come out in a rash if I eat beans . Look , Duane they have a wide selection . I think I 'll try the fish . I don 't know . From the look of them , I 'll bet $ 1 0 they 're from Los Angeles . Hey , you hippies , get your butts off the road ! I like the globe . It flashes red like our Krypton sun . But not this irritating noise . Make way . Did I hear right ? That son of a bitch give me an order ? Duane , you take care of it . - But l- - - Duane . You gotta learn to kick ass , you wanna be a peacemaker . All right . Just what in the hell do you think you 're doing here ? What is this symbol ? Do you follow another leader ? Follow the leader ? Holy skunk sweat . - All right . - A weapon of some sort . Huh ? Wha- - ? Oh ! How the hell did you do that ? Jesus H. Christ . Crude noisemaker . I 'm just checking the tire , you know . - Wow , this is your home ? - No . Actually , I live in the city , about three blocks from you . No , this is a very special place for me . I wanted you to see it . Listen , you warm enough ? I guess I should be freezing , but I 'm not . Good . Come on , let me show you . You see ? You only smell strong . Whoa , baby ! It 's only because I didn 't want to lose my place in the orchestra . Oh , my . The circus is in town . Hey , sweet thing . Set them buns down here . Let 's just hold hands . Let me know if this tickles . Mm-hm . Your right front tire is flat , Duane . - Sheriff , what happened ? - Willie . I think my arm 's broke . Girl or no girl , you 're gonna spit teeth . Get up . What the sam hill ? Is that you , Boog ? Uh , oh . Uh ... All right . Get them up and keep them up ! These humans are beginning to bore me . - Please , mister- - - He 's a general . Please , Mr. General . Please let my daddy down . Hey- - Hey ! Hey , hey ! You okay , Jody ? See , when my father died- - That 's my Earth father , I mean . - -I found this crystal . - Huh ? - Uh ... This is kind of hard to explain , but you see , it , um- - It called to me . Oh . Yeah . And it brought me here . It helped me to build this place . Well , actually , it built it , really . But , um that 's when I found out who I really was , and what I had to do . So , what do you think ? You like it ? Like it ? It 's incredible . I mean , not that it couldn 't use a woman 's touch , you know ? - Especially around dinnertime . - Dinner . Oh . I 'm sorry . See , I don 't usually do too much about- - Listen , tonight , sky 's the limit . Anything you want . - I 'm home . - Oh ! Should we eat ? - Sure . - Great . - Good morning , America . This is East Houston , Idaho . Until yesterday , a middle-American town that Middle America had forgotten . But today , the population- - Exaggerated reports put it at 123 . - -has increased by three . And these three new arrivals bring destruction in their wake . As I look west into East Houston this morning I see a town gripped with fear . MAN 1 : Who 's the big guy ? Okay , yeah , we 've gotta be a- - - No . - We 've got a crack in that diode . - Come in on him if you can . - Try to wiggle it . Who else is seeing this ? Well , with this satellite linkup , just about everybody . The whole planet . The whole planet Houston ? Earth . The whole planet Earth . WOMAN : Get over to the commentator . You may continue . As the extraordinary story continues- - - As this extraordinary- - - Enough of this man . If the whole planet is watching , let 's show them something interesting . MAJOR : Throw down your arms and surrender ! This is an order . General Zod does not take orders . He gives them . Hey , you all right , buddy ? He was in the line of that fire and nothing happened to him . I haven 't seen the likes of this since Superman . Yes ? Yes . The Newsbeat control room has informed me that a fleet of helicopter gunships is- - - Mr . President , sir , can 't we- - ? - There 's nothing anybody can do . They have such powers , nothing can stop them . Where 's Superman ? Where is he ? Why doesn 't he do something ? - General Smythson has said that nuclear weapon strikes have been ruled out because of the danger to the civilian population . PILOT : Starting fire run now . Stand by , rockets . Fire one . Fire again . Locked on target . Gotta take a run now . The rockets didn 't have any effect . Look . They need machines to fly . What bravery . Be nice to them , my dear . Blow them a kiss . - We 're out of control . We don 't understand . We 're coming in , coming down . Can 't control it ! We 're coming down . I win . I always win . Is there no one on this planet to even challenge me ? - Mmm . That was good . - I thought we might , uh abandon the orange juice for once . - Here , cheers . - Cheers . Must be tough being Clark Kent , isn 't it ? No . No , I really- - I really like it sometimes . Even though I do make a fool of myself . But , you know , if it weren 't for him , I never would have met you . But he is you . - It 's kind of confusing . - Not to me , it isn 't . For the first time in my life everything 's clear . I 'm gonna go change into something more comfortable . Come forward . Your general wishes to speak . I am General Zod , your ruler . Yes , today begins a new order ! Your lands , your possessions your very lives will gladly be given in tribute to me , General Zod . In return for your obedience you will enjoy my generous protection . In other words , you will be allowed to live . So you are a general ? And who is your superior ? - I answer only to the president . - And he will answer to me . Or all of his cities will end up like this one . - Your father and I have tried to anticipate your every question , Kal-El . This is the one we hoped you would not ask . But I have to , because she 's everything I want in life . And she , the one you have chosen she feels as much for you ? Yes . Then , if this is what you wish if you intend to live your life with a mortal you must live as a mortal . You must become one of them . This crystal chamber has harnessed the rays of the red sun of Krypton . Once exposed to these rays all your great powers on Earth will disappear forever . But consider . Once it is done , there is no return . You will become an ordinary man . You will feel like an ordinary man . You can be hurt like an ordinary man . Oh , my son , are you sure ? Mother I love her . You did all that for me ? Huh . I don 't know what to say . - Just say you love me . - Oh . - Thousands of hours to create , and they defaced it in seconds . Imagine what they 'll do to the world if we resist . The whole place is gonna fall ! Watch it ! You are the one they call president ? I am . I see you are practiced in worshipping things that fly . Good . Rise before Zod . Now , kneel before Zod . You are not the president . No one who leads so many could possibly kneel so quickly . I am the man they are protecting . I am the president . I 'll kneel before you if it will save lives . It will . Starting with your own . What I do now I do for the sake of the people of the world . But there is one man here on Earth who will never kneel before you . Who is this imbecile ? Where is he ? I wish I knew . Oh , God . Zod . Hey . You 're awfully quiet over there . I 'm supposed to be the shy one . Yeah , I was just thinking I can 't believe what you 've given up for me . - Are you kidding ? I didn 't do it for you , Lois , I did it for us . - See , I told you there 'd be a hot dog place somewhere . - Okay . It sure takes longer when you can 't fly . Hurry up . - Come on . - Okay . My back 's stiff . Come on , it 's my treat . Come on . Oh , boy , it 's Mr. Wonderful . Thank you . - Do you have a men 's room ? - Yeah . Right in the corner . - Want to sit down ? - Yeah . Hi , what would you folks like ?

This is your president . On behalf of my country , and in the name of the other leaders of the world with whom I have today consulted I hereby abdicate all authority and control over this planet to General Zod . Zod . Only by strict compliance with all his directions will the lives of innocent millions be spared . Superman , can you hear me ? - Superman , where- - ? - Who is this Superman ? - You 'll find out . And when you do- - - Come to me , Superman , if you dare . I defy you . Come ! Come and kneel before Zod . Zod ! - Here ? When ? - When ? Where the hell have you been , Mac ? On a desert island ? I have to go back . You can 't go back . - There 's no way now . - I have to . I 've gotta try , damn it . I 've gotta try something , anything . It 's not your fault . You didn 't know this was gonna happen . They knew . I heard them . I just didn 't listen . Hey , come on ! Please ! God . Father ? Mother ? Boy , I really wish you could hear me . Because I need you . See , I ... I , uh ... I failed . Father ! You 're master of all you survey . And so I was yesterday . And the day before . Hello , there . Lex Luthor . You 've heard the name ? The greatest criminal mind on Earth . I told you this was a puny planet . Wait just a moment . Wait until you get to know me better . Will you , please ? Wait . Look , I can give you anything you want . I can give you the brass ring the unlimited freedom to maim , kill , destroy . Plus , Lex Luthor 's keen mind . Lex Luthor 's savvy . Lex Luthor 's career guidance . Lex Luthor 's School of Better- - We have all of this without you . You cannot bargain with what you don 't have . Magnificent One what I am bargaining with is what you do not have . The son of Jor-El . - The son of Jor-El ? On this planet ? - Aye . Possibly you know him better by his nom de voyage or his name he travels under : - Superman . - Oh . So this is Superman . How do you know of Jor-El ? My Fullness , as I explained to you before I 'm about the best there is . Revenge . We will kill the son of our jailer . - Revenge . - Revenge ! Now we 're cooking . - He flies , then ? - Constantly . - He has powers as we do ? - Certainly . But , uh , Magnificent One he 's just one where you are three . - Or four , if you count him twice . - We will bring him to his knees . Wait ! First , you must find him . And Lex Baby is the only one who knows where he is . What do you want ? Well , general the world is a big place . Thank goodness , uh my needs are small . As it turns out , I have this affinity for beachfront property . What do you want ? Australia . I can 't understand it . Where is he ? He shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree and now he 's decided to pull a disappearing act . Maybe we haven 't figured out his game plan . Game plan ? It 's fourth down , the two-minute warning has sounded and the ball is deep in our territory . Just how brilliant do you have to be ? I mean- - Superman 's got something up his sleeve . That 's for sure , chief . - We just haven 't figured it out , right ? - He 'll be here ! If it 's at all possible , he 'll be here . See ? Yeah , and she knows his plays better than anybody . Yeah , better than anybody . Maybe he hasn 't heard about it yet , chief . Sounds like an earthquake . Quick , take a picture . Get down the back way ! Get out ! Oh ! Ow ! You all right , chief ? Even with all this knowledge when will these dummies learn to use a doorknob ? Hi . You should see the White House . They 'll be cleaning for months . Lex Luthor . You promised me the son of Jor-El . Yes , Your Grace . But what I 've given you is the next best thing . You just hold on to that little lady , and he 'll be along . See , they have this relationship . She does all his public relations , and he gives her every exclusive . They 're the best of friends . You know what I mean ? What an undemanding male this Superman must be . You could use a tuck here and there yourself . Wait ! - Oh , I 'm sorry ! - She lives for now . Kill the rest , starting with him . Wait . Wait . Don 't you remember the White House ? The Oval Room ? We had a few laughs , right ? General would you care to step outside ? Superman ! Superman , thank God . I mean , get him ! Come to me , son of Jor-El ! Kneel before Zod ! Watch out . You all right ? Wait there . Son of Jor-El . We were beginning to think you were a coward . I 'm not a coward , Zod . Let him prove it . Then die as you deserve to ! Come on , come on , Superman ! Get him ! Man , this is gonna be good . Take him . He 's yours . Come on ! Kill him ! Superman . The big one 's just as strong as Superman . Ah ! Hold him . Wow , home run . Oh , my God ! My baby ! Thank you . This Superman is nothing of the kind . - I 've discovered his weakness . - Yes . He cares . He actually cares for these Earth people . - Like pets ? - I suppose so . Sentimental idiot . He 's caged Non . I 'll draw his fire with some of my own . Get out of here ! The rig 's gonna blow ! Get away from that truck ! - Did you see that ? - They went down there . Hey , what the- - ? Superman , help us ! Superman . I never thought this thing would go the distance . You people , get back . Here , take the end of this . No ! Don 't do it ! The people ! Throw it ! - This way , please . This way . - Help me . Where 's your wife , sir ? I got her . I got her . Don 't worry . He 's dead . He 's dead . Superman is dead .

[ INDISTINCT CHATTERING AND SHOUTING ] Hey , hey , hey ! What sound ? You forgot your cha- - Wait a minute ! - I 'm holding it , I 'm holding it ! - I got it . I can 't see what 's happening . - My hair ! - Your hair ? What about mine ? Hold on ! Yeah , yeah , I got your message . No , go ahead . Go ahead . Yeah ? Yeah ? Yeah , yeah . Look , he 's alive . He 's alive ! It 'll be all right . Come back , please ! Please come back ! So he is a coward after all . Damn it ! Come back , Superman ! What about us ? - Don 't leave us ! - We can 't handle it without you . - It 's not our fault . - He chickened out . Ah , phony ! Superman didn 't even do nothing . Come on , let 's go . Get away from here . Jimmy . Our victory is complete . The son of Jor-El has fled . - Superman fled ? - I don 't believe you . - The next time , we will kill him . - The next time ? The next time ? What am I gonna do with you people ? I held up my end . I delivered you the blue boy . What do I get from my triple threat ? " Bow , yield , kneel . " That kind of stuff closes out a town . Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it ? Kill me ? Lex Luthor ? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age ? - Eradicate the only man on earth with- - - Kill him ! - -Superman 's address ? Come . The three of us will crush the son of our jailer . Why not increase his handicap ? Since he cares so much for these Earth creatures let us take his favorite . Hey , ever heard of parachutes ? Another small step for mankind . Scruffy . So morbid . A sentimental replica of a planet long since vanished . No style at all . I expect better manners from my guests , Zod . We must combine our strength . Fools ! Take him ! What ? We used to play this game at school . Never was very good at it . Superman , I knew that you 'd- - Huh ? Wrong again , Zod . No , no ! Release the general or we 'll tear her apart . Superman , no ! No ! Superman , don 't ! All right ! Did you really think we would give up our advantage ? Now , the son of Jor-El will be my slave . Forever . If not , the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance . Destroy this place . - Hi , guys . Sorry I 'm late . - We have no more use for this one . - Kill him . - Me ? Lex Luthor ? General , you came to me with nothing . I gave you Superman . Silence ! Well , look- - Watch it . Don 't touch me . Guy 's a clod . Promises were made , gifts exchanged . I gotta hand it to you , you know . You always told the truth . A guy always knew where he stood with you . Try to get them all into this molecule chamber . It takes away their powers , see and turns them into ordinary human beings . Now , if you could ... Shh , shh ! - Don 't go in there . It 's a trap . - Luthor , you poisonous snake ! That 's a molecule chamber . It makes people like you into people like me . You 've done well , Lex Luthor . General , the crystal there activates the mechanism . Lex Luthor , ruler of Australia activate the machine . Thank you . With your permission . And now , finally ... Take my hand and swear eternal loyalty to Zod . He switched it . He did it to them . I mean , the lights were on out here while he was safe in there . Hey , you know something ? You 're a real pain in the neck ! - Are you all right ? - Uh-huh . I knew you 'd double-cross me , Luthor . A lying weasel like you couldn 't resist . Who , me ? Are you kidding ? Hey , I was with you all the time . That was beautiful . Did you see the way they fell into our trap ? Too late , Luthor . Too late . Look . Look , Superman . I got a proposition for you . Now , don 't stop me till you 've heard this because I know I owe you one , but we 're in the North Pole , right ? Let 's wipe the slate clean . If you give me a ride back , I promise to turn over a whole new leaf ... It looks so beautiful from up here . I guess I 'll never get to fly with you again . Oh , no . Anywhere you want to go . You don 't have to worry . I 'll never tell them who you really are . I know , Lois . I know . See you later . - Hi , Leueen . - Hm . Hi . How 'd you sleep ? All right ? No , I didn 't close my eyes all night . - Look , Lois- - - I understand , I understand . I sat up all night listening to the voices of reason . You know how vile it is to hear the first bird of the morning when you 've been crying all night ? - I 'm sorry . - I 'm sorry too . I guess it 's sort of like being married to a doctor , you know . The doctor gets awakened in the middle of the night and the wife has to cope with the fact that he 's gone . I guess I 'm just too selfish . No , no . You 're not selfish at all . Yes , I am selfish when it comes to you . I am selfish . And I 'm jealous of the whole world . Lois , it may not be easy for you to hear this now , but someday you 'll- - Clark ... Look , don 't tell me that I 'll meet somebody . You 're kind of a tough act to follow , you know . Now , I 'm gonna be fine . You don 't have to worry about me . I like worrying about you . Would you stop ? Don 't you know that this is killing me ? Do you know what it 's like to have you come in here every morning and not be able to talk to you ? Not be able to show I have any feelings for you ? Not be able to tell anyone that I know who you are . I don 't even know what to call you . Lois , I don 't know what to say . I don 't know . Just say that you love me . Um ... Gee , Lois , are you okay ? What happened ? - I just got so dizzy . - You all right ? - I don 't know . - Get her some water , will you ? That 's what happens when I don 't have orange juice . - I 'm fine . I 'm fine . I 'm fine ! - Breathe . Breathe , Lois . - I 'm breathing , for heaven 's sake . - Good for you . Good . - God . - Just drink . - Okay . - Just sip it , sip it , sip it . - I 'm fine . - Boy ... What was I talking about before ? - If I know you , it was probably about Superman . - Him again ? - Clark , Clark . You 've gotta stop being threatened every time the guy 's name 's mentioned . Nobody expects you to be anything but what you are . Well , I 'll try to remember that . You better remember that . I appreciate you . - You do ? - Sure . - Especially if you get me a hamburger . - Uh-huh . A hamburger . At 9 a.m. ? Yeah , and everything on it , okay ? Everything on it . - Oh , and- - - Orange juice . Sure . Freshly squeezed . Okay . Isn 't he a nice guy ? Well , let 's see what trouble I can get into today . Leueen . What 's happening in the world ? Leueen ? - Hey , Ron . - Yeah ? Give me another plate of this garbage . Garbage ? That 's my number-one special , Rocky . All right . Get me some more coffee too , will you ? Gee , that 's funny . I 've never seen garbage eat garbage before . Excuse me , sir . I think you 're sitting in my favorite seat . Come and get it , four-eyes . Now cool it , Rocky . Take it easy , will you ? I just had this joint fixed . It cost me a fortune . Oh , God ! This order 's to go . I 'm terribly sorry about all the damage , sir . Oh , I 've been , uh , working out . Good afternoon , Mr. President . Sorry I 've been away so long . I won 't let you down again .

You wanted to see me , dr . Brandon ? Ah , yes , michael . This operation that you 're about to perform , I feel , is very ill-Advised . No surgeon should ever operate on a patient That he has personally injured . It would make him too emotionally involved . Don 't you think i 'm aware of that ? But there 's only one other person i 'd trust To perform this operation-Beckermann . Dr. Beckermann was murdered in europe . You know that . Exactly ! Not only is he dead , he 's 6,000 miles away .

Felix conrad . I 'll be escorting you to the lecture hall . Did you just step off that elevator ? There was no operator . They 're all afraid . You haven 't heard about vienna 's elevator killer ? Elevator killer ? People have been getting on elevators on one floor Only to arrive at another floor dead . Like beckerman . Ja . Dr. Schlermie beckerman . A brilliant brain surgeon . One of your colleagues . It was a great loss . I 'm thankful you 're all right . The academy is looking forward To hearing you lecture this morning . I hope I don 't ruffle any feathers . My speech might be a little radical for the old guard . It would take quite a bit To shock any of this crowd . Ladies and gentlemen , I can envision a day When the brains of brilliant men Can be kept alive in the bodies of dumb people . What are they saying ? They 're just saying " murmur murmur murmur . " It 's just sort of a general murmur ? Yeah . Murmur . Oh . You may murmur all you like - But to make transplantation possible I have recently invented the cranial screwtop method Of entry into the brain whereby a large section Can be unscrewed without having to shave the head . And as a safety feature , i 've made it childproof . To open , you push down while turning ... and voil ? , the human brain . Where is this man 's brain ? Stolen ! It 's the fourth incident this month . I wish to apologize to our american colleague . This demonstration is now concluded . Dr. Hmfhruhrr ? It 's close . Yes ? I 'm dr . Alfred necessiter . Well , well , well . Dr. Alfred necessiter . Would you like a drink ? A drink would be interesting . I enjoyed your lecture today . What lecture ? They gave me a head with 3 lemons in it . That 's why I enjoyed it so much . I didn 't have to hear your brilliant but old-Fashioned Theories on the human brain . What do you mean , " old-Fashioned " ? I 'm the most advanced brain man working today . I don 't think so . Read this article . Look at the underlined part . And look at this . Read the caption under the photo . And these - Newsweek , time , cosmo . National enquirer - Dolly parton wants to have my baby . Don 't tell me i 'm old-Fashioned . I didn 't mean to upset you , doctor ! You 're the most brilliant brain man working today . That 's why i 'm most anxious to share my work with you . It seems you 're the one person in the entire universe Who might understand it . And I agree with what you said here . " My brilliant research in brain transplantation " Is unsurpassed and will probably make my name Live beyond eternity . " I told him to take out the " probably . " My laboratory is set up in my home . If you have a moment , I could show you my work . When ? Now ! All right . I can 't believe they didn 't take out the " probably . " You know , that photograph doesn 't do you justice . Well , hello . I didn 't expect to see you here . Ow ! Oh , you dirty ... what 's the matter ? You 'll have to forgive me . Being in austria and meeting a scientist with your interests , I half expected your laboratory to be in a castle , not a condo . You mean ... like this ? Yeah . That 's more like it . Jesus . This is extraordinary . From the outside , it does not look this roomy . I had a good decorator . My wife . It 's amazing what she did with a few throw pillows , Some wallpaper , and a staple gun . Leapin ' lizards . Yes . We have those . Moat with alligator ... here 's our small entrance hall . Do you have enough closet space ? There never is . No . They fill up so fast . This is the tv room . Oh , I love the way it 's so dreary . This , doctor ... is my laboratory . Brains . I 've never seen so many brains out of their heads before . Feel like a kid in a candy store . Don 't touch it ! Why ? They 're alive . Alive . But there 's no wires or tubes or that " bzz " thing . How are they kept alive ? With a special fluid I developed . Why do you have all these brains ? My vision is to be able to take The thoughts and data from a dying brain And transfer them into another body Without opening the skull . Would you care for a drink ? Please . What would you like ? A tahitian lady . Right-O . Flaming ? Oh , no , no . That 's for tourists . Where do you get your brains ? The city morgue . For a nice tip they send me brains from bodies That have died in the right way . What is the right way for a body to die ? For my purpose , an injection of 200 ccs Of ammoniated strychnoclorahype Into the buttocks , Causing the brain to die last . Thank you . Ammoniated strych - That 's window cleaner . That 's the exact ingredients in window cleaner . Yes . And who does the injecting , dr . Necessiter , you ? Good lord , no . It 's the elevator killer , bless his heart . You 're condoning murder , aren 't you , dr . Necessiter ? As long at it 's happening , i 'm happy to accept it . The only time we doctors should accept death Is when it 's caused by our own incompetence . Nonsense ! If the murder of 12 innocent people Can save one human life , it would have been worth it . Worth it ? You 're condoning murder ! I 'm not condoning murder , sir ! shut up in there ! Research and murder do not go together ! And you shut up ! With your tv blaring all night And your 6 grandchildren running down the halls ! I 'm sorry , doctor . These walls look solid , But they 're thin as tissue paper . That 's typical for a condo . Now , let me show you How far i 've progressed with my experiments . You knew a schlermie beckerman ? You 've got schlermie in one of those jars Like so much marmalade ? No ! He isn 't in a jar ! He 's walking and talking . That 's impossible . I saw photos of the body . Itispossible . I must warn you , doctor ... what you are about to see ... might strike you as the most incredible , awesome - Excuse me . Incredible , awesome what ? Just a minute . Hello ? Yes ? I 'll be there immediately . Thank you . What was that awesome thing ? I must leave now . I have a new brain to pick . The elevator killer has struck again . What about beckerman and incredible ? Come for dinner tonight and bring mrs . Furrear . Hfuhruhurr . Hfuhruhurr . 8 : 00 . You can let yourself out . Now , if you will just turn around . Undlift your robe . Ja . hi . What 's going on ? Don 't interfere . He 's paying me $ 15,000 just to touch my behind . You ! Get outta here ! Please , forgive - Get out ! This kind of thing could ruin our marriage . Why ? Because you don 't want me to work ? Earn my own money ? Have my own career ? You call this a career ? Oh , i 've made those veins in your temple throb . Oh , I love that . Ha ha ha ! Dolores , our marriage lies broken on the floor Like the shards of glass on our honeymoon suite ! Aah ! Oh ! 19th century indian rubber vase , eh ? Dolores , I am making a citizen 's divorce . What ?

Dr. Hfuhruhurr ! I 'll be back . Just stay here . I believe you know this gentleman . Is that dr . Beckerman ? Sort of .

Beckerman 's vast knowledge Couldn 't be accommodated . Dr. Beckerman ? That 's him all right . We never did like to shake hands with him . He must be lonely .

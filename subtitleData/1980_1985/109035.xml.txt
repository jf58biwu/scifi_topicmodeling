 Why are you going so fast ? It 's just for fun . Jaffar . Calling Jaffar . Claude here . Answer ! Come in ! - Who are you talking to ? - Jaffar , this is Claude . Where are you ? Answer me ! This is on tape . Jaffar , this is Claude . I 'm calling from the planet Perdide . Northern hemisphere , 73rd quadrant , 16 hours 50 , universal time . Jaffar , they attacked us by surprise . It was horrible . Eilene 's dead . I 'm heading for the zone of the Dolongs . I 've crashed . I 'm trapped . I 'm sending Piel into the Dolongs with a microphone . For God 's sake , come get him ! Hurry ! I beg you ! Thank you , Jaffar ... and good-bye . Claude . Take this , Piel . - Catch it . - What is it ? It 's a microphone . I don 't understand . Call it Mike . Mike is a friend of yours . When Mike talks to you , you must do exactly what he says . Now run as fast as you can through the Dolongs ... and stay there until the machine- - until Mike- - talks to you . I can 't run . My knee hurts . Anyway , I don 't want to go into the Dolongs . I want to go home . Your mother doesn 't want us to come home right now . Do as I say ! Run through the Dolongs . Run , I tell you ! Run ! Well , very nice . What 's the matter ? - You idiot . - What 's got into you ? What are you doing ? Look what 's happening . We almost collided with that meteor while you were taking a nap . I don 't understand . I thought the collision-swerve control was automatic . Yes , but only for matches that weigh less than 1 0,000 tons . Well , I didn 't know that . You don 't know very much . Hello . I have refreshments for the navigators . Is anything wrong ? - No , nothing 's wrong . - Holy stardust ! How long has this signal been on ? How should I know ? I don 't understand anything about this tub of yours . Jaffar , this is Claude . I 'm calling from the planet Perdide . Northern hemisphere ... 73rdquadrant , 16hours50 , universal time . Jaffar , they attacked us by surprise ! It was horrible . Eilene 's dead . I 'm heading for the zone of the Dolongs . I 've crashed . I 'm trapped . I 'm sending Piel into the Dolongs with a microphone . For God 's sake , come get him ! Hurry ! lbegyou ! Thank you , Jaffar , and good-bye . Piel ! Can you hear me ? Answer if you hear me . I 'm calling you . Listen to me . I don 't like you . And I don 't like your lights , either . I don 't like you either . What ? I didn 't know you could hear me , Mike . Piel , is that you ? Of course it 's me . Where are you ? Right here , in front of you . I 'm speaking to you from far , faraway . Really , Jaffar , he doesn 't understand . - Perhaps you should- - - Why do you have two voices ? Answer , Mike . I know your name is Mike . Why do you have two voices ? You 're right , Piel . My name is Mike . And I have two voices because I have practically nothing else . I don 't have eyes to see with , nor legs to walk with ... nor arms to hold things with . So instead , I have two voices ... and I can even have more than two . Do you understand ? I think so . - You 're in a forest now , aren 't you ? - Yes . With glowing red and yellow fruit ? Yes , that 's right . Good.Just wait there . Just one second . Are you saying that we are no longer going to Aldebaran ? That 's exactly what I 'm saying . But Captain , we are paying you a fortune to take us to Aldebaran . You can 't break your word . I didn 't promise you anything , Prince Matton . It so happened I was on my way to Aldebaran . It was your idea to join the ship- - and with half the public treasury in your possession . Only that which is mine . Don 't make me laugh . The entire police force of the Interplanetary Reform Alliance ... is on your heels . Your destination makes no difference to you . It can be Aldebaran , or anywhere else ... just as long as you get away . Yes , I 've changed our destination . It 's no longer Aldebaran . It 's Perdide . Consider yourself lucky , Prince , to be going anywhere at all ... and that I 've taken pity on you . And don 't smoke on board ship ! Oxygen is precious . Go down to your cabin and buckle in . In order to reach Perdide , we 'll first have to land on Devil 's Ball ... and then arc over to Gamma Ten . On Gamma Ten , we 'll have to wait until the passage of the Blue Comet . By keeping within the magnetic field of the comet ... we can hope to approach Perdide in one month , real time . Mike , why have you been so quiet ? Piel , I 'm busy right now . I 'll talk to you later . Oh , they 're lovely . Silbad calls them his shroos . Jaffar , you rascal , you ! Why didn 't you warn me ? It wouldn 't be so bad , Perdide , if it weren 't for the Frelons . You know about the Frelons of Perdide , Princess ? Here . Look at this . The Frelons of Perdide did it to me years ago . They like to eat the brain of a man ... just as if it were a soft-boiled egg . Mr. Silbad , if you don 't mind- - Sorry , Prince . As you were saying , Jaffar . Your friend Claude ? Claude has a son called Piel . A son ! It 's bad enough being loaded down with a wife , but a kid too- - I tell you , Jaffar , your friend is doomed . He 's dead . Those Frelons again . His wife too , and the boy ? The boy 's taken refuge in the Dolongs . As long as he stays in the Dolong forest , he 's safe . The pollen from the trees keeps off the Frelons . No other settlers around ? Piel is totally alone in Perdide . How old is he ? He must be somewhere between five and ten Earth years . The only link you have with him is through that mike ? A little marvel , that microphone . Instant communication anywhere in Space Five . Yes . Claude gave it to me . He thought I might need help one day . As it turned out , he was the one who needed it . Let me think . They 've been singing for three days . It won 't be long before they metamorphose . If someone- - someone who knows Perdide very well- - were to remain in constant contact with the boy ... and keep telling him just what to do , he can get out . He can make it . How long will it take you to get there ? Hello , Piel . Are you there ? How would you like to hear a song ? Listen to this . What about " The Song of the Lamprey Guzzlers " ? Do you know that one ? Sing it to me , Mike . Well I 'd like to introduce myself If you can spare the time To listen to this song and help my story to unwind I 'm the Astro Guzzler the interstellar Fool Riding on my Lamprey and everything is beautiful I can see a million eyes Smile at me as I go by I 'm another Peter Pan I 'm another Superman Rollin 'along the stars with nothin much to do I 'm another Robin Hood Who 's in the neighborhood But I couldn 't hurt nobody if I wanted to And I couldn 't give a care 'Cause I 'm a millionaire When people say I 'm " starey-eyed " no l don 't care I 'm another Peter Pan I 'm another Superman I never cry Why should I When I don 't feel blue You ought to be ashamed of yourself ... singing those kind of songs to a child . Why did you stop , Mike ? Keep singing . I 'll sing the rest later on . Right now , little one ... I want you to eat one of those pretty red fruits . I 'm tired of them . Isn 't there anything else ? Do you want me to get angry ? Okay , okay . What 's a lamprey ? Ah , my boy , that was a proud space vessel ... the last of an illustrious fleet . What 's a guzzler ? Well , now , that 's , uh- - Guzzle- - that means sort of to drink . Soguzzlers are people who like to drink ... just a tiny little bit . You know , Mike , that 's just what I 'd like to do- - drink . - I 'm thirsty . - I 've already told you . You can drink the juice that comes from the red fruits . I don 't like that taste . Couldn 't I have some water ? Listen , son . I know something that 's much better than water . Is there a strawberry near where you are ? A huge , enormous strawberry ? I can 't see any . Look around a little . They grow on the trunks of trees . There must be some around . There 's one , over there . Right . I 'm standing in front of your big , fat strawberry . - What shall I do now ? - You see those soft , round spots on it ? - Yes . - Burst them open with your finger ... and something will flow out that 's much better than water . That 's good ! Now what are you up to ? First you sing him drinking songs ... and now it sounds as if you 're trying to get him drunk . Under the circumstances , my friend , we can 't be choosy . The juice of the legol contains a harmless alkaloid ... but it 'll help him sleep . The more the boy sleeps , the better . It 'll keep him out of trouble . Are you sure it won 't intoxicate him ? If he soaks up the stuff for a month straight ... then maybe yes , a little . But he 'll get over it very quickly . Believe me . I know from experience . I think I 'll go for a swim . I really like your friend . I 'm glad . He 's quite a character , isn 't he ? He certainly is . - You know- - - Yes ? I don 't know , but somehow I get the impression he 's hiding a deep sorrow . Maybe I 'm just imagining things . Not completely . The fact is , Silbad does suffer . - His head ? - His heart . Silbad has been hopelessly in love for 20 years . In love ? With whom ? With this planet . You 're going to witness something very rare . Close your minds ! They 're arriving ! Oh ! What 's that ? The metamorphosis of the shroos . But be careful . Those little scamps are telepathic . Close your minds ! They 're arriving ! Close your minds . They 're arriving . - Careful . - Leave us in peace . Go on , be off with you . Close your mind , human . I hear everything . Look ! Two of them seem to be stuck . Yes . And the petals are closing again . Stay here . I 'll go . Hello , Piel ? Little Piel , do you hear me ? Would you go and fetch the prince , please ? If we want to enter the Blue Comet 's magnetic field ... we have to go on board ship in less than an hour . I bet you 'd be mighty happy to abandon the prince here . Certainly not . You and your code of honor . Hello . Who are you ? Come on , now . Don 't be afraid of me . Am I afraid of you ? 'Course not . Just a minute . You 're not the one who took my Mike , are you ? Listen , you old pirate , do you think anything 's wrong ? It 's been a long time since we 've heard from the boy . That 's true . He should have been awake for some time now . I think I hear something . As if Piel were a long way from the microphone . Can you hear me ? Well , I can 't shout any louder ... but we have to make a sound that will catch the boy 's attention . Do you know the war cry of the fighting monks of Guama Seti Five ? Then you 'd better cover your ears . No comments , please . Just wait . Mike , was it you who shouted like that ? Are you all right ? It sounded like you were very far away from me . That 's because there was a big animal sitting on you . I 'm glad I found you again . Me too , little one . What happened ? I heard a terrifying noise . It was nothing , my dear lady . I was just clearing my throat . I drew it from memory . Here 's the Desert of the Sooks . The Dolongs are here . Claude was driving there from the west . The little fellow , therefore , had to cross through here . Good . There are only a few grottoes there . But couldn 't the boy use a grotto for shelter ? My dear lady , the grottoes of Perdide are full of Sourpleas . - Full of what ? - Sourpleas- - another scourge on Perdide . They 're a sort of maggot that burrows into the skin . Oh , how awful . - You don 't think Piel could be- - - No . I 've questioned him thoroughly . He hasn 't got near the grottoes . What worries me more is the lake . The lake ? What 's the danger there ? Nothing , really . It 's just a body of water filled with friendly little fish . However , there 's nothing to stop a kid from drowning ... even in a harmless lake . By now , Piel must be very close to it . There 's something odd going on behind that screen . Something that doesn 't- - Aha ! Stowaways ! The others preferred to remain on Devil 's Ball . To await the next transformation . Something smells here . Mind your language in front of a lady . Oh , dear . Perhaps it 's my perfume . No , madam , not at all . Your perfume is exquisite . You must excuse my chum . He says anything that pops into his head . A bad telepathic odor ? That 's it ! There 's a thought here that stinks . Now , enough of that . I 'm ashamed of you . Don 't you know how to behave yourself in polite company ? Anyway , it 's gone now . Piel , are you there ? Yes , I 'm here- - and I 'm getting fed up with being here too . Yes , I understand , dear Piel . So fora change , why don 't we take a little walk ? I don 't want to take a walk . I want to be somewhere else . Of course , but to be somewhere else , you have to walk . I want you to visit a lake . You 'll be able to wash yourself there . Why ? I 'm not dirty . All right , you don 't have to wash . But it 's pretty there , and you 'll enjoy it . Well , if I don 't have to wash , okay . How do I get there ? First , you have to turn your back to the moon . Why have you changed your voice again ? I like the other ones better . The others have to rest . How much farther is your lake ? We 'll be there in just a few minutes . I 'm going to see what the prince is up to . Ah . Here you are . I was wondering where you 'd gone . Well , I just wanted to be useful . Since no one was looking after the child , I thought I would . Any new developments ? No . He 's asleep . Look ! Like this , they 're beautiful . What 's the point of owning sparkling things ... if all you do is lock them in a bin like trash ? You know how it is , space mate . Human beings- - or at least , some of them- - don 't care about the beauty of things . It 's only their value that interests them . " Value " ? What is " value " ? A concept . I read it in their thoughts . And what 's the concept ? To tell the truth , I don 't know for sure . It 's something that drives men crazy- - at least some of them . Prince Matton , for one . Now there I agree with you . His thoughts smell terrible . Perhaps we should warn the others . They 're humans , space mate . We are gnomes . It 's best that we each mind our own business . - " Business " ? What 's " business " ? - None of your business . Humans have their own way of doing things ... and we have our way . I suppose you 're right . But Prince Matton 's thoughts still stink . There we are . From this point , we can rely on the computer . It 'll put us in orbit around Gamma Ten ... and keep us there until the Blue Comet passes . Then it will send us into the comet 's gravitational field . Since we 'll be orbiting Gamma Ten ... would we have enough time to land there ? We could if we wanted to . All right , I 'll relieve you now . Oh , but I prefer to stay here and look after the child . You see , Jaffar ... when I said a little while ago that I wanted to be useful ... I truly meant it . The thoughts of that human keep smelling worse and worse . Well , close your mind , space mate . Those are human affairs , not ours . - Piel ? - Well , it 's about time ! What happened to you ? Did you fall asleep ? Never mind.Just tell me- - are you still walking ? Don 't forget , you have to reach the lake . But I 'm already there . Oh , good . And what have you been doing ? - I saw a big fish . - Is that all ? Did you wash yourself ? You said I didn 't have to . I 've changed my mind . You have to take a bath . Walk into the water and head towards the middle of the lake . But I 'll drown ! Of course you won 't , you little fool . If you carry me with you , I 'll support you . I 'll make you float on the water . You 'll see . Are you in the lake yet ? Yes. it 's cold . Walk to the middle of the lake . Keep walking . Forward ! Obey me ! Oh , Mike , this is getting deep . - No , Piel ! Stop ! - Belle ! - Don 't move . - You wouldn 't dare . Mike ! What did you say , Mike ? What do you want me to do now ? I 'm cold , and the water 's getting deeper . Piel , turn around and head back to shore . Get out of the lake at once . Belle , listen . I can explain . It 's perfectly clear . But if we continue on to Perdide , we 're finished . They 'll take my treasure . We 'll be nothing but miserable tramps , wandering from planet to planet . Jaffar , please come here immediately . Right . I 'm coming . Go to the Dolongs and dry yourself , Piel ... and wait there until I speak to you again . I have to think for a moment . Belle , have pity on me . Try to understand . If you tell Jaffar I tried to kill the child ... he 'll throw me out into space . Belle , please , I beg you ! What happened ? Mike , I did what you told me to do . I 've come out of the lake , and I 'm drying myself with some leaves . Now what should I do ? Just wait there . I see . - May I make a suggestion ? - Go ahead . Oh , no ! There go all our decorations . All that work for nothing . I 'm beginning to think that the human race is crazy ! Let me out ! I 'll kill you ! I swear , I 'll kill you ! Good grief ! We 've got to do something . I can 't take anymore of that human 's thoughts . I 'll simply die if he continues . Yes . He 's giving me a splitting headache . Look . He wants to get out of here , right ? Perhaps if we were to- - Don 't talk nonsense , space mate . That type is a cosmic danger . Jad , I 'm getting sick . Let 's help him escape . All he wants is to take the shuttle craft and land on Gamma Ten . That 's not all , Yula . He also wants to recover his treasury ... and recruit mercenaries and massacre everybody . No . We can 't let him get away . But he 'll never come back from Gamma Ten . What do you mean ? Can 't you hear that planet ? Hear it ? It 's bursting my eardrums . Mine too , space mate . That 's a world I don 't want to have anything to do with . He 'll never leave it . No . Not a chance . Well , then , shall we liberate that monster ? You 're sleepy Lay easy tonight You 're sleepy You 're high on a flight of magic You can when you dream But remember You 're only a child Remember Alone in the wild Remember This life can be mean Everything 's fine now , Mike . I 'm warm and I 'm sleepy ... and I like it so much when you speak in a voice like mymum 's . Go to sleep now , little Piel . I love you , Mike . And I love you too , little Piel . What 's going on ? Someone 's ejected in the shuttle craft ! It 's the prince ! Prepare the emergency capsule . What kind of planet is this ? What was all that ? I don 't know , space mate ... but just a little more of it and I think my brain would have melted . I think mine is turning to stone . We have to do something . First of all , let 's not lose Jaffar . Jad , I 'm afraid . I 'm afraid of what 's under that dome . Me too , space mate . I 'm scared stiff . We 're the ones who got Jaffar into this mess . Now we 'll have to get him out of it . We must contact the others in the spaceship . We can try . That thing 's liable to swallow our brains if we 're not careful . Now , my dear lady , there 's nothing we can do except wait ... and hope that Jaffar will be able to return here ... before the passage of the Blue Comet- - which only gives him five hours . At last ! Where were you ? Don 't think this is easy for us , what with that thinking thing . It 's no use . It 's too much for you . But take off my helmet . Listen . You 're going to have to pilot the shuttle craft . Tune in on my thoughts , and I 'll show you how to fly it . Take it back up to the spaceship . Tell Silbad to catch the Blue Comet , and go and save the boy . And desert you ? Out of the question . I 'm not so sure it 's out of the question . Why don 't we get out of here ? We can always return later to save Jaffar . That 's it . Yula is right . No . Yula is wrong , and he knows it . Yula , I 'm ashamed of you . You 're a coward , a scaredy-cat , a crybaby and a milksop . And what 's more , a spineless , chickenhearted jellyfish . You know very well what will happen to Jaffar ... in just a few hours if we leave him here . I can take care of myself . Not against that , Jaffar . Not against that thing . - What thing ? - It doesn 't have a name . It 's-It 's pure thought . Don 't worry . I can handle pure thought . I 'm afraid it 's beyond even your strength . The thought will absorb you as it has all the others . - What others ? - All those who 've set foot on Gamma Ten . Once they were normal people . Now they 're puppets- - puppets of that thing . Brothers , it is time . Once again ... difference has intruded ... on Gamma Ten . Once again , the ceremony must take place . Once again , difference must be abolished ... and unity restored . Here they come ! I smell their thoughts . Relax . We still have a moment . Pull , Jaffar ! They 're coming ! They 're coming ! Jad , is there anything I can do ? Matched against the thing , your thought is powerless- - a feather against a mountain . That is , unless- - Unless what ? Unless you can turn your thought against itself ... and against any other thought . If you can become pure denial , pure hate , pure insane fury ... Then there 's a chance- - a slim chance- - that you can annihilate the thing . But you will annihilate yourself at the same time . - I prefer to be destroyed than enslaved . - They 're here ! Hurry to the shuttle , and do exactly as I told you . Obey me ! Good-bye , Jaffar . Hurry ! Jaffar , do you think I 'm a coward and a crybaby ... and all those other things Jad called me ? Of course not . You 're a sweet little gnome , Yula . That 's what you are . Now good-bye . Thank you , Jaffar . Here is the second individual . Carry him to the glory of the sameness . Happiness . Happiness upon them ! Happiness upon us ! Happiness ! Unity ! Are they going to turn us into fodder for that blob ? It 's more complicated than that ... but that 's the general idea . I propose that we fight and die together . That won 't do any good , Matt . Don 't you understand ? I propose that we fight . We can wipe out a few dozen of them before they crush us . The enemy is there , Matt . All those poor creatures are nothing but puppets . Then let 's attack the blob itself . - There must be something we can do ! - Yes , there is one thing . When we 're absorbed into it- - when it tries to turn us into contented puppets- - we must hate ourselves ... and deny ourselves with all the force in our minds . We must become madmen in order to drive it mad . But even if we succeed ... we 'll leave our skins here as well as our souls . That suits me fine . My skin isn 't worth much , and my soul is worth nothing . The ceremony ... is begun ! In a few moments ... the unhappy ones ... will lose their individuality . They will be one with us . We will be one with them ! You know something , space mate ? Your thoughts have an odd smell . Your intention 's a funny color . That 's because I don 't appreciate your thinking I 'm a coward . Come on . We have very little time before the Blue Comet passes . Right . Hold tight ! Good-bye , Matt ! Here goes ! No , Jaffar , I 'll go ! If you ever get out of this , take care of Belle . Monstrous vibration ! Difference is opposing unity ! One individual is hurling himself into totality ! The ceremony ... is destroyed ! The individual denies with all his strength ! He denies totality ! Difference denies unity ! Hatred denies happiness ! Fury denies peace ! Galloping galaxies ! What are they doing down there ? I swear , they 've started a planetary war . You sound worried , Mike . Is anything the matter ? No , Piel , I 'm not worried . Look , Belle ! He did it ! He 's returning ! Prepare for takeoff . - Jaffar , do you hear me ? - Roger . May I be struck by a wayward asteroid ! What in the devil 's name is all that ? Sorry. I was a little too busy to forewarn you , Silbad . We have guests for dinner . You 're a funny kind of wah-wah , aren 't you ? Have you lost your pals ? Let 's go and look for them together . Are you quite sure he 's gentle ? Oh , yes , Mike . I told you , he 's my pal . Piel 's working with something that goes , " wah-wah . " There 's nothing to fear . It 's merely a hyperniteryx . Gentle as a lamb and strictly vegetarian . How are you feeling , Yula ? You know very well . Oh , my poor space mate . The worst time is when they 're asleep . That 's when their thoughts smell the strongest . What I don 't understand is why humans immediately begin ... to stuff themselves with food and drink as soon as they meet . Not only humans . Did you see how much that Centaurian packed away last night ? I can understand , but- - I beg your pardon ? Excuse me . I 'm tuned into hiccups- - that big man with the mustache ... who drank three quarts of moonshine last night . He can 't control his hiccups ... and neither can I. Try to close your mind . I can 't . I have the hangovers of thirty ... two people , all at the same ... time . - Is everything all right ? - Yes . Belle , I haven 't yet told you how Matton died . It 's not necessary . I 'm sure he died as I wish he would have lived- - with generosity and courage . - Silbad ? - Trouble ? Yes . We are being pursued by a warship of the Reform . - Great ! Let 's attack ! - it 's not that easy . All right , everyone . Meeting in the conference room at once . This is the space cruiser Silver Demon , of the Reform Patrol Fleet . Unidentified ship , maintain your speed . We are going to board you . This is spaceship Double Triangle 22 , receiving you . We await your visit with humble respect . Captain Jaffar . If you hadn 't saved my life ... I 'd cut your throat for your cowardice . Do you want to surrender to them ? I want them to board us . You and your comrades need your own ship , right ? Well , you can get theirs ... but only by letting them board ours first . Comrade is right . We 're stalking big game . We must proceed with caution . If you have any ideas- - I believe I have . Allow me to present my good friend , Onyx the Deegwid of Gnaz . What 's he supposed to do , make them die laughing ? My friend has the natural ability to mimic anything . Go ahead , Onyx , give us a little demonstration . Amazing ! It even has the smell . Onyx fully controls his molecular structure ... and can change it in an infinite number of ways . Hey , Onyx , change yourself into a secret weapon- - something dreadful . By the rings of Saturn ! It 's amazing what they can do nowadays . As you can see , the illusion is perfect . I must admit , that opens up a lot of possibilities . What do you think , Silbad ? I think the Reformists are in for a bad time . A ship 's approaching that 's full of foul-smelling thoughts . Attention , everyone . As soon as the link tube is sealed ... silence . Jad and Yula , if anything goes wrong ... warn me by telepathy . Honored representatives of the Reform ... I welcome you on board my humble ship . Your humble ship is giving refuge ... to the traitor Matton , former prince of Atoll . And the treasure chest that was stolen by the traitor . Silence . Indeed , it was while defending some mysterious guest that Matt- - that the prince- - was murdered by the pirates of Gamma Ten . Matton is dead ? And where is that chest now ? In the hold , with the pirates we took prisoner . Let 's go and see that famous treasure chest . Halt ! Leave that here . But it 's not a weapon . I said leave it ! Mike , me and Wah-wah , we found a house . We 'll be safe here until his friends come . Go on , Wah-wah . Go on in . Somebody do something . What a marvel . Our prisoners- - the pirates of Gamma Ten . May I suggest that Your Excellencies ... have these miserable creatures reeducated ? Perhaps . We 'll see . Everything 's going fine , Jaffar . They don 't see the trap . They don 't see anything . They 're all blind . Captain , I see that you mean well . Guard , prepare for immediate transshipment . Tell me , Silbad , how long do you think ... it 'll take them to become masters of the vessel ? Those buccaneers , with their secret weapon ... two hours . They might prefer to stretch out the pleasure . The microphone 's no longer working . Answer me , little one ! We 've lost him ! I 'm afraid we 'll never hear from him again ! Come on , Belle . Don 't worry . Silbad 'll fix it . There 's nothing wrong with it . The problem is , there 's no one at the other end . Do you know something ? You 're not very pretty . In fact , you 're ugly- - all of you . Go away ! Do you hear me ? Go away ! Get out of here ! I 've given her a sedative . She 's convinced it 's her fault . Nonsense . Something must have happened on Perdide . Fortunately , we 're getting nearer . Soon the computer will release us from the Blue Comet 's gravitational field . Hello , Piel ? Can you hear me ? The stars- - they 're fading out in this sector of Perdide . What was that ? A magnetic storm ? The detector dials are going crazy ! We are- - What 's happening ? According to these insane instruments ... all the radiations in the Perdide sector , including its light rays ... are going backwards ! Buckle in , fast ! Attention . Attention . Attention . This is Robot Patrol ship number five ... of the Federation of the Masters of Time . This is a warning . You are approaching the forbidden zone of Perdide . Identify yourselves and decelerate to a stop . I repeat ... you are entering a forbidden zone . Identify yourselves and stop . Calling advisor Pixa . Foreign vessel is entering the forbidden zone . Its course is irregular . Shall we destroy it ? No. I wish to investigate . Board the vessel and conduct it to the base . - And Silbad ? - Yes . But in truth , the old man is dying . It 's just a question of hours . You and your ship were just at the outer fringe of the concussion area ... when the operation took place . - What operation ? - Do you know where we are ? Well , I can see we 're in a hospital somewhere in space . Not just somewhere in space , Princess . We are in a particular zone now being colonized by the Masters of Time . Have you ever heard of the Masters of Time ... and their method of accelerated colonization ? - No , never . - It 's a strange race , Princess- - a race that can manipulate time itself . When they decide to colonize a planet , they project it into the past- - literally send it backwards through time . In this instance , 60 years backwards . So for those on a distant ship ... it would seem as if light rays were speeding in reverse ... and all of space were going mad . Exactly . But to those on the planet being colonized ... everything would seem to be perfectly normal ... except that their present time wouldbe that of 60 years ago . And that 's what happened to Perdide . My God . Piel . Mike . Mike . Jaffar , how old is Silbad ? No one knows . No one 's ever known anything about his childhood . Be still . The old man 's past is rising from the depths . - Shut your eyes , humans . - And open your minds . For what is hidden in the folds of time can now be revealed . Now long-lost memories ... the unknown past of a small child ... can be projected on your mental screens . Shut your eyes , humans , and open your minds . Mike ! Mike ! - it 's Piel 's voice ! - Silence , humans . Mike ! Where are you , Mike ? It 's Piel ... just as he was when we were approaching Perdide . it 's Piel as he was 60years ago , Belle . it 's Piel hurled into the past , along with the entire planet ... by the Masters of Time . Lowry ! Cover me ! Get away ! Get away from him ! I hope those filthy beasts didn 't hurt you too much , son . I 've done everything I could . The doctors on my planet will do the rest . And now the best thing you can do is sleep . Where are we now , Lowry ? What time is it ? Those monsters ! Speak up , Lowry ! Didn 't you hear me ? I 'm sorry . I was thinking . - You 're getting old , Lowry . - Alas , Igor , aren 't we all ? I 'll have none of your insolence ! Now , then , be good enough to explain to me ... why we suddenly found ourselves on the surface of a planet ... when just a moment before we were in empty space ? - Weren 't you paying attention ? - I had nothing to do with it , Igor . It was the planet 's fault . - What planet ? - The planet Perdide . It suddenly appeared before us without warning . Come now , talk sense ! Where did it come from ? - From the future . - Lowry ... I think you 're becoming feebleminded . lam not becoming feebleminded . The planet Perdide surged out of the future and almost smashed into us . But the child , Lowry , the child . Didhe also , as you say , surge out of the future ? Exactly , Igor , with the planet . It 's stopped . What happened was , the child recovered . He became a cabin boy , then a space sailor ... a pilot , a mercenary ... a hundred other things that filled 60 years of his life . Piel . Silbad . The orphan of Perdide is dead , humans . He has left our time to enter into eternity . It 's strange . There are only a dozen , but I sense the emotions of a thousand . - I know . Me too . - Where 's it all coming from ? From here . From my heart , Yula . I believe we loved that old man very , very much . Look up there ! A Master of Time .

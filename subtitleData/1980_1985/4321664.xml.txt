 Everybody stay close . When this thing breaks open it 's gonna go down fast . JO : So , uh , he and Vicki were high school sweethearts , huh ? LOCKE : I 'll go on ahead and meet up with Patterson and his men at the bar where the smuggler 's were scheduled to make the connection . JO : You mean where Mike and I are going to make the connection . LOCKE : Right . I 'd get a long way with her . Hold on ! They 're still there ! Damn ! We 've got to lose them before we reach our chopper . We 're losing them . Not yet . Airwolf . Come in Airwolf . Good morning , this is your pilot speaking . Co-pilot . Are we in business ? Negative ! The smugglers got the jump on us . Do it ! Watch it ! Jo , are you guys okay ? We 're fine , Saint John . Just nail those suckers . We 're home free , baby . Where in the hell did that come from ? Damned if I know . You , in the black chopper . This is a Federal narcotics investigator . Set your machine down right now . I said set it down now ! Looks like they want to play it the hard way . Two can play that game . Dump the stuff . Get rid of it ! What the hell happened ? Want to take a look at the goods we nabbed from those smugglers ? Ooh , yeah . Two , maybe three million bucks . That 's what this nose candy 's worth on the streets . Peanuts compared to what we figure 's been coming up the coast the past few months . Well , at least we got the goods , even if we did miss out on the couriers , huh ? They were small change . It 's the buyers the Company is after . So what 's next ? We got a pretty good lead from the evidence we found in the smuggler 's jeep . Shouldn 't be long before we find our man . I 'll be in touch . Everybody stay close . When this thing breaks open it 's gonna go down fast . Anyone expecting a visitor ? Scotty . Scotty ? Scotty , you always knew how to make an entrance , you ... Hi , SJ . Buy a girl a cup of coffee ? Vicki . That 's Scotty ? SAINT JOHN : You still haven 't told me why that husband of yours didn 't come with you . He , uh , he doesn 't know I 'm here . Oh , no , thank you . Scotty and me ... We 're in quite a mess . The business ? Right . Trouble in paradise . Fishing charters just aren 't what they used to be . Well , it 's the off season , isn 't it ? No , it 's more than that . We haven 't been able to keep up on the maintenance , we 're behind on our back taxes . Scotty just won 't face the facts . What can I do ? You can come back with me . Talk some sense into him . He wants to sell out . Sounds like that may not be such a bad idea . No ! We can 't . The man trying to buy us out , he wants to log the island . He needs our area for access , it 's the only way on or off the island . I won 't let him do it . All right , slow down . What does Scotty think about all this ? ( SCOFFS ) You know Scotty . He just wants the easy way out . Sounds like things aren 't too great between you two either . Just come back with me . He always listened to you . Okay , Jo , shut her down . We got it . Okay . So , uh , he and Vicki were high school sweethearts , huh ? Yeah , that 's right . Seems she dumped him for this guy , Scotty , back in the twelfth grade . I have a funny feeling she 's still bad news . Yeah , well , get over it . Green isn 't one of your best colors . Ah , Vicki ! Well , she 's all set . Here , let me give you a hand . Careful . Thanks , Mike . Saint John . Jason 's not going to like this with the other business we have to attend to . I 'll be back tomorrow . Two days tops . You sure you know what you 're doing ? Yes , mother . Take it easy , Saint John . There it is , Paradise Island . Ah , it 's just like the old days . Remember when you and Scotty used to fight over who was gonna take me up flying ? Those days were over soon as you learned to fly on your own . Flying solo 's not all it 's cracked up to be . Oh , my God ! My God , look ! Oh , my God ! ( GASPS ) No ! Scotty , no ! No ! ( SOBBING ) Vicki ! That 's it ? You just haul him away ? What about an investigation ? A man was murdered ! Look , Mr. Hawke , is it ? We don 't get a lot of this kind of stuff up here . The body 's got to be sent to the mainland for an examination . We can 't call it a murder until we get an official cause of death . " Cause of death ? " He was shot full of holes ! Look , whoever did this could still be on the island . I doubt that . The only others up here full time are the Salish Indians , and they 're all friends of Scotty 's . Have you questioned them yet ? Just let us do our job , Mr. Hawke . Who are you ? Luther Manysons , a neighbor . Vicki said you 've been a great help . Vicki , what do you say we get out of here ? No ! This is my home . You can 't stay here . Not after this . No ! Scotty and I came up here for keeps . I won 't let Patterson have it . I won 't . Did she take something ? Yeah , Valium , I think . Mixed with booze ? No wonder she 's in another time zone . Grab that blanket , will you ? We 'll just let her rest . There are some things you just can 't sleep off . So what do you think ? This Patterson guy capable of murder ? Patterson would have his men do just about anything to get this land . It 's his only way of getting at the logs . The rest of the shoreline is too rough to bring boats and equipment in . I thought this was your land . True . But the government leased the timber rights to Patterson . Fight him in court ? We tried . But the law says his piece of paper is stronger than our centuries of tradition . Well , we 'll see what they say when the police file that coroner 's report . There will not be a report . Patterson owns the police . He owns the politicians . But my people are not for sale . Damn you , Scotty ! Vicki . Scotty ? Scotty ? Take it easy , it 's all right . Where 's Scotty ? Just rest . We can talk about it later . Just take it easy . What the hell are we running here ? Why didn 't he check with me first ? It was an emergency . What ? He said he 'd be back by today . Get him on the horn . Tell him this drug ring is about to bust wide open . We need all the help we can get . ( TELEPHONE RINGING ) Paradise Air . PATTERSON : Good morning , Vicki . How 's Scotty ? Patterson , you son of a ... I want my property back , Vicki . I want it now . Hi . Was that the phone ? Oh , no , couldn 't have been . Phone 's out of order . Patterson 's gorillas must 've cut the line . I thought I heard ... Never mind . How are you doing ? Oh , I 'll live , I guess . I don 't know what I 'd do if you weren 't here for me . I want you to come back with me . No . No , I can 't . Vicki , you can 't run this place by yourself , especially after what 's happened . I can 't let Patterson ... Forget about Patterson . I 've got connections of my own he 's going to have to deal with . You got another phone I can use ? No . But there 's one on Luther 's side of the island . It 's a big hike . I 'm not leaving you here alone . You up to the walk ? Yeah , I guess so . Come on . It 's this way . Still out of order . Still out of order ? That 's a nice way to run an airline , huh ? He 'll have to call us . We 'd better get down to the Company . The surveillance team is due back with the goods on the buyer . Looks like we 've got our man . LUTHER : Some of these trees are hundreds of years old . They belong to the island . And the island belongs to your people . No . My people belong to the island . Scotty and I had such a great relationship with Luther and his people . Everything was fine until Patterson crawled out from under his rock . Hey , Vicki . Hey , Jacob . Who wants to play catch ? Bye . LUTHER : How is she ? SAINT JOHN : Well , she seems all right , but I 'd like to get her away from this place . Can I use your phone ? Sorry , the phone 's out of order . It 's hard to get a repairman to make house calls up here . My great grandparents are in here . So are my mother and father . This is where Patterson is gonna put his road . Haul out the logs after he strips the island . I still can 't believe Scotty was ready to sell out to scum like Patterson . Sell out ? Scotty would never have sold out . He hated Patterson more than we did , if that 's possible . Vicki said he was ready to give it all up . Why would Patterson kill a man who was on his side ? Why would Vicki lie ? She gets confused sometimes . She 's like that . Patterson has already got her spirit on the run . Once he gets control of the dock , there 's no way of stopping his men or his machines . His kind have a way of getting what they want . Well , maybe this time , Patterson 'll get what he deserves instead . I should be getting back . Oh , no , you can 't go . Not yet . I want to help you , Vicki . You really should come back with me . No ! I can 't leave this thing unresolved . We 'll watch your place . We won 't let Patterson near it . You should get away . What do you say , Vick ? Vicki . Vicki ! Why 'd you lie to me , Vick ? What 's that supposed to mean ? I mean you and Scotty . He didn 't want to sell out , did he ? I don 't know . Did he ? I don 't know ! I think you do . Come on , Vick , talk to me . Scotty and me , um , we were just about finished . He was leaving me . I thought he 'd be long gone by the time we got back here . Why 'd you come to me ? I guess I just needed a friend . When you 're ready we 'll head back to the mainland . I ... I still don 't know . Come on now , Vicki , you 're supposed to trust me , remember ? Patterson ! Vicki . What the hell are you doing here ? How nice of you to come by . Please make yourself at home . This must be Mr. Hawke . How very kind of you , sir , to come to Vicki in her hour of need . The only thing she needs is for you and your men to get back on your plane . Frankly , Mr. Hawke , I don 't believe the lady 's business arrangements with me are any of your affair . I could threaten to call a cop . But I see you 've already got one in your pocket . I 'm just here to see no laws are broken . Oh , that makes me feel much better . Look , I want you out of here now ! Well , not until we 've discussed our unfinished business , darling . You don 't hear so well , Patterson . Move ! Take him outside . Move ! Hand it over ! Take a walk , Patterson . Vicki . Vicki , you and I can settle this thing without anyone else getting hurt , darling . Move it , Patterson . I 'll be back . Not if I can help it , Patterson . Mr. Hawke , the bite of the black widow spider is quite deadly . I suggest you watch your back . I suggest you show us yours . ( CHUCKLES ) Come on , we 're getting out of here . Now . All right , you want to play 20 questions some more or you want to level with me and tell me what Patterson 's really after ? This landing area , this place . What do you think he 's after ? Patterson 's too smart to risk a triple murder rap on a lumber deal . Now what the hell 's going on ? I told you ! Come on , Vicki ! All right , it was Scotty ! Scotty and Patterson had some kind of a deal . I don 't know what it was . All Scotty told me was that it was gonna be good fast money . That 's all I know . I 'm going to patch up this wiring . By the time I 'm finished I want you ready to fly out of here . Anything you say . Still nothing . I don 't like it . It 's not like Saint John to be out of touch this long . Well , if we 're lucky we can get in touch with him along the way . So where do we go from here ? I 'll go on ahead and meet up with Patterson and his men at the bar where the smuggler 's were scheduled to make the connection . You mean where Mike and I are going to make the connection . Right . So , anyway , what 's this guy look like ? There you go . Real Mr. Nice Guy , huh ? The word is , his last shipment was hijacked . So he 's plenty hot for this one . You 're sure he doesn 't know what the smugglers look like ? Yeah . I hate surprises . This guy is strictly on the business end . He wouldn 't risk getting this close , unless something big was going down . ( SIGHS ) Oh , well , let 's move . Saint John 's down there someplace . Well , he 'll have to wait . You guys have an appointment to keep . ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ) You 're late . Just be glad I 'm not 15 , 20 years late . Time off for spilling our guts . Escobar didn 't tell us there was going to be heat . Well , now , it 's a risky business . So is getting your hair cut in a strange neighborhood . It 's okay , Joplin . You see , any man that can outrun a federal agent is a valuable asset in my book . If you 'd like to earn some extra money , you might be able to assist me in one small other matter . Like what ? One of my carriers did a 180 on me . And it might take some convincing to recover the goods . What 's in it for us ? ( CHUCKLES ) People of commerce . I like that . Five hundred . ( LAUGHS ) Santa Claus . What , have I been a bad boy or what ? What did you think it was worth ? How about a taste ? Hey , I know ski resorts with less snow than you . What 's an ounce to a big time operator like yourself , huh ? All right . All right . But we 'll take care of that other little matter first . Hey , how many times do I have to tell you not to play so close ? Why 'd you kill him , Vick ? That the gun you killed him with ? What makes you say that ? Scotty was killed with a 9 millimeter . Patterson 's men carried.357 s . Very good , Mr. Holmes . From the bullet I took out of the plane , I 'd guess that you shot him as he was trying to leave . Why 'd you do it , Vick ? It was all his fault . He shouldn 't have gotten in my way . He had all the smug easy answers . " You can do it , Vicki ! Come on , Vicki ! " One day at a time , Vicki . " I had my ticket out of here , and he took it away from me ! He forced me to do it ! So you dragged me into this to protect you from Patterson 's soldiers . Get back ! Don 't come any closer . It doesn 't have to end this way , Vicki . Let me help you . It 's too late for that . So now what ? You 're gonna kill me ? Is that it ? Don 't make me use this . ( EXCLAIMS ) This might get a little rough . The girl that ripped us off has got some heavyweight running interference for her . Ah , don 't worry about it . MIKE : So what are we supposed to do after we find the dope ? PATTERSON : Get rid of them . Hey . We were hired on just to make a delivery . Escobar never said nothing about offing anybody . Hey , we 're playing hardball here . What can I say , you know , it wasn 't part of the deal . What is this ? What is there , a new dope runner 's union I don 't know about ? You know , first that Vicki pulls a fast one on me and now you guys . You do what you 're told . MIKE : Vicki , huh ? I knew a Vicki once . She was a real fox , too . She had blond hair down to her ... Waist . Well , this one 's a smart mouthed little red head who needs to be taught who she shouldn 't mess with . I can see that . Just fly it . Okay , okay , I 'm flying . So this is what it 's all about . Scotty must have hidden it in the cemetery . All he had to do was let me go . That 's all you have to do , too . I 'm sorry , Vicki . How the hell did you let yourself get involved in this ? Me and Scotty were into this stuff pretty bad . We came up here to get away , to get clean . At least Scotty managed to shake it . But you didn 't . No , I was still doing business with one of my connections . He put Patterson onto me . It was going to be such easy money . Only Scotty didn 't see it like that . There 's nothing more self-righteous than a reformed addict . He begged me not to do it . But you did it anyway . Yeah . I guess I never was very good at making the right choice . Was I ? ( HELICOPTER APPROACHING ) Let 's go . Get back inside . Get down . Don 't try it ! Hey , so this is the tough guy she brought in , huh ? Don 't look so tough to me . Where is it ? I ate it . Ow ! Now , you really are one tough guy , you know that , Patterson ? What are you , a Boy Scout ? It 's right over there . Take it and get out of here ! Well , I 'm afraid it 's not really that simple anymore . You see , you had your chance , Vicki . But you blew Scotty away instead . Now get him out of here ! You heard the man . Move ! Give me that bag . Let me go ! Let her go , Patterson . Shut up ! Give me the bag ! You won 't get far , Patterson . Let me go ! Please , let me go ! Shut up ! I 'd get a long way with her . Let go of me ! Get the gun . You 've got to stop him , Jason , he 's got Vicki . I know , they 're taking off . So where do you want me to go ? I don 't know . Go south ! Attention , in the plane . Who the hell is that ? I want to see you drop your weapons now . Well , do it ! Do it ! The radio . What the hell are you doing , Locke ? Don 't worry . It 's under control . LOCKE : As instructed , drop your weapons and let the girl go . All right , I 'm doing it ! I 'm doing ... I did it . That was a wise move , Mr. Patterson . Vicki , take the plane back to Paradise dock . What the hell you doing ? I 'm getting free . Tell Saint John I 'm sorry . Ignition ! I threw it out . Pull this thing up ! Don 't do it , Vicki . Vicki and Scotty came here looking for a new life . Instead , a shadow of death followed them here . I only hope they can find a peace in death they couldn 't find in life . You 've done them a great honor , Luther . They belong to the island now . She will guard their souls . I wish I 'd known they had a drug problem . I wish they would 've trusted me . Maybe I could have helped somehow . Maybe . What can you do to save the land ? Everything we can . We 're gonna take over the charter business . That should pay for a few lawyers . We might even find a Supreme Court Judge with Indian blood . ( INAUDIBLE )

 MING : Klytus , I 'm bored . What plaything can you offer me today ? KLYTUS : An obscure body in the SK System , Your Majesty . The inhabitants refer to it as the planet Earth . How peaceful it looks . ( RUMBLING ) ( MING LAUGHING EVILLY ) KLYTUS : ( LAUGHING ) Most effective , Your Majesty . Will you destroy this Earth ? Later . I like to play with things a while before annihilation . ( MING LAUGHING EVILLY ) ( FLASH 'S THEME PLAYING ) ( WIND HOWLING ) ( MING LAUGHING ) MAN ON RAD / O : Bill Lewis gives it away to Johnson at the 10-yard line . Touchdown ! Oh , what a beautiful ... ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) ( HISSING ) Green Mountain Airways one , two , three , requestjoining instructions . Well , I sure hope Flash Gordon had a great vacation . He 's gonna have to work hard to top last season . Yeah . ( M / NG LAUGHING ) Any problem , fellows ? Bit of clear-air turbulence . Nothing serious . Nothing you 'd want to toss a third-down pass through , either . Would you like to autograph this for my kid , Mr. Gordon ? Glad to . What 's his name ? Buzz . Call Boston Approach , see what they got . It might be smoother higher up . Yeah . Would you do us a favor and leave them alone ? They 're busy driving the bus . It 's just a little turbulence . We 'll be through it in a minute . My name 's Flash . I know . Look , I 'm sorry if I seem rude . I 'm just a little scared . Oh , it 's kind of nice . I mean , a travel agent Who 's scared in airplanes . I saw you at the hotel last night . Iasked the maTtre d ' who you were . Oh , talk to me , please . Get my mind off this . I couldn 't believe a girl like you was alone . You 're just saying that to get my mind off this . No , I mean it . What were you doing there alone ? I was trying to get my head together by myself , you know ? I sure do . It 's okay . It 's all right . Honestly , it 's nothing . Famous last words . I 'm taking flying lessons . Sometimes air rises above clouds , and you get a ... ( WHOOSHING ) What 's the matter ? ( GASPS ) What 's happening , Flash ? ( SCREAMING ) Cowabunga ! Dr. Zarkov . There 's no sun . It 's 8 : 24 in the morning , and there 's no sun . No sun ? No . Check the angular vector of the moon . MALE REPORTER ON TV : Seemingly , there is no reason for these extraordinary intergalactical upsets . Only Dr. Hans Zarkov , formerly at NASA , has provided any explanation . His ideas , however , have been rejected by the Scientific community as irrational . According to scientists at NASA , this morning 's unprecedented solar eclipse is no cause for a / arm . A team of NASA scientists has been in conference with the President since 7 : 00 this morning . What did you find ? The moon out of orbit ? By more than 12 degrees . This must be a mistake . No , that 's no mistake . It 's an attack . ( THUNDER CLAPPING ) I 've been right all these years . ( WHOOSHING ) ( GLASS SHATTERING ) Fragments of moon rock . Our moon is being subjected to some enormous force from outer space , a kind of energy beam . Time for us to go , Munson . Go where ? I 've got the coordinates now , the direction it 's coming from . This is what we 've been waiting for , Munson . We 'll go up and counter-attack them . You 're crazy . I 'm not going up in that . I can 't handle the capsule alone . Well , you better try . Get your toothbrush and whatever . Right , Chief . Munson ! Munson ! Munson , why are you running away ? I don 't understand it . All the frequencies are dead . I don 't understand it . All the frequencies are dead . Yeah , will you get a look at the VOR ? Holy cow ! John , 10 : 00 . Hold on tight . Let 's put baby down right here . ( THUDDING ) What the hell ? My God , where are the pilots ? Hydraulics going . Grab that wheel . Help me pull her up . Are we coming up ? I can 't see a thing . Me , neither . Look for the landing lights ! This isn 't my scene , Flash . Look where ? Switches over there , start hitting them . Listen , did your flying lessons get as far as landing ? I was afraid you 'd ask that . No . Hang on . Here we go . Munson ? ( WIND WHISTLING ) I swear , Munson , IWlshooL . Get shot or go up in that thing , what 's the difference ? This way , you 'll be giving your life to save the Earth . Haven 't you any spirit at all ? No . ( PLANE ENGINE ROARING ) Dr. Zarkov , listen ! You 're back . MUNSON : Let me explain ! ( CRASHING ) ( SCREAMING ) Dale , you all right ? Oh , I 'm terrific . Come on , let 's get out of here before she blows . ( THUNDER CLAPPING ) Just hold me two seconds . Then drop me , and I 'll kiss the ground . Are you sure you 're okay ? I 'm fine , but that 's it . No more flying for me . Good morning . Are you injured ? Lord knows why , but it seems not . A miracle . I expect you 'd like to use my phone . Thanks . I would . Well , it 's right in there . Listen , we 've wrecked your place . I 'm sure the insurance will cover it . Oh , please don 't mention it . What the hell happened to the sun ? Looks like an eclipse . Are you sure ? There was nothing about an eclipse on TV . Well , the phone is right in there . Sorry , Munson , missed your opportunity . Where 's the telephone ? Flash , I 'm sure that 's Dr. Hans Zarkov . Who ? He 's a crazy scientist . I saw him on TV , and he kept talking about an attack on the Earth . They kicked him out of NASA and ... Dr. Zarkov . Enough . Are you crazy ? Unfortunately not . The attack has begun . I estimate we have 11 days before our moon crashes down and destroys us . I need aid in taking off . Taking off ? For where ? Up there , where it 's coming from . I need one person to keep their foot on that red pedal during blastoff . You 're the lighter . Sit down . You may leave . Tell the world what Hans Zarkov has done . VVeH , IguesslWlbe running along now . You lunatic ! Dale . You really crazy letch ! DALE : Flash , the door ! ( MACHINES BEEPING ) ( RUMBLING ) Sit down . Keep a foot on that red pedal or the G-forces will kill us all . My God , we 're moving ! For God 's sake , strap yourselves down , quick ! The red pedal . Friendship . Built this to send in friendship . The end now , unless we three can ... Unless we can ... Strange object imaged in the imperial vortex . KLYTUS : What distance ? Now parallel to Starfield Zygma 12 . Approaching . KL YTUS : Test object for life Waves . TECHNIC / AN : Positive . Form unknown . Approximate Mong sca / e three . Object 's entering our control range . Approaching the Sea of Fire . Bring it through safely . Land it . Wake up . Dale , wake ... We 're okay . It 's me , Flash , remember ? We 're on the ground . Back home ? I don 't think so . Hello , we 're from Earth . Friends . Flash , whoever they are , it 's clear they are highly developed . I 'm sure we can reason with them . You wanna bet on it ? My God ! DALE : What is this , a civic reception ? FLASH : More like a police state . ZARKOV : If it is , that could be our good luck . FLASH : Why ? It means we 'll find allies on every side . Look at them . The poor wretches are just waiting for someone to lead them in revolt . Are you looking at me , Zarkov ? Yes . Please , stop talking about revolts . I just want to get back home alive . GLOBE : Guards , halt . Prisoners , follow me . ( BUZZING ) GLOBE : Ha / t , Lizard Man . Escape is impossible . Surrender . ( WHIMPERS ) Prisoners , march below me to the presence of Emperor Ming . Let 's not argue with it . Here , hold my hand . You wanna reason with that ? If it fails , I 've still got the gun in my pocket . Don 't worry . I 'll make it plain I 'm acting on my own . You 'll be all right . Zarkov , it 's plain suicide . No , it 's a rational transaction . One life for billions . GLOBE . ' Ha / t . Proceed . ( GROWLING ) ALL : Hail , Ming ! Hail ! Ruler of the universe ! Hail , Ming ! Hail ! Emperor of the Galaxy ! The tributes of the Hawkmen will be first . Are we dreaming ? I 'd like to think so . The fabled Ice Jewel of Frigia . We seized it in battle from the royal crypt . Stop ! The Ice Jewel is our tribute , not Vultan 's . Vultan stole it while we were burying our dead on Frigia . Liar ! You are a thief . What ? Set down your weapons . No one , but no one , dies in the palace without a Command from the Emperor . Hail , Ming . Vultan ! You obey , or you 'll sacrifice your daughter . Hail , Ming . Now the tributes from Ardentia . Your Majesty , we , the people ofArdentia , we have suffered since you blasted our kingdom . I can offer you nothing this year , except my loyalty . Prince Thun , we prize nothing more highly . And tell us , how great is this loyalty to your emperor ? Without measure . We are delighted to hear it . Fall on your sword . Show us this loyalty . Throw yourself onto your sword . May this deed of Prince Thun be an example to all the kingdoms of Mongo . Death to Ming ! This Ming is a psycho . This Ming is a psycho . Who said that ? The fair-haired prisoner . Come along , Fellini . Hey , remember me ? Who are you ? Flash Gordon , quarterback , New York Jets . Dale Arden , Your Highness . Live and let live , that 's my motto . My name is Hans Zarkov . I 'm a scientist . I kidnapped them here in an effort to save our planet , Earth . An obscure body in the SK System , the satellite which has been giving you so much amusement recently . But why ? We are only interested in friendship . Why do you attack us ? Why not ? Pathetic earthlings , hurling your bodies out into the void without the slightest inkling of who or what is out here . If you 'd known anything about the true nature of the universe , anything at all , you would have hidden from it in terror . Come closer . No , notyou ! You , let us see you . No . Dale . Don 't , Flash . ( MOANING ) Did you ever see such response ? No , truly . She even rivals your daughter . What happened to me ? I don 't know , but it was pretty sensa√ºonaL . Remove the Earth woman . Prepare her for our pleasure . ALL : Hail , Ming ! Hail , Ming ! Hail ! Forget it , Ming . Dale 's with me . Flash . Stay back . DALE : Don 't , Flash . They 'll kill you . ( GRUNTS ) I 'll go with them . Just ... Oh , you ! Flash ! Yeah ! ( CHUCKUNG ) Dale ! Klytus , are your men on the right pills ? DALE : Get ' em , Flash ! Maybe you should execute their trainer . Go , Flash ! Feet . Get out . ( GROANS ) Come here . You fools ! He 's playing some barbaric game . Now match him . Like this ! Now ! Forty-one ! Forty-two ! Forty-three ! Go , Flash . Go ! Go , Flash ! Go ! Go , Flash ! Go ! ( ALL CHEERING ) ( CROWD EXCLAIMING ) Don 't kill him yet , Father . I want him . Give him to me . What would your Prince Barin say ? I can handle Barin . Please . Really , Aura , your appetites are too dangerous . I refuse . Guards , deliver the scientist to General Klytus for Conditioning by the imperial secret police . This one here has defied us before our subjects . We order him disposed of tonight by public execution . KALA : This is a public announcement . The earthling Flash Gordon is to be executed at 29 : 15 Mingo mean time . Fly back to your kingdom . You may see me sooner than you think . Lying bitch . I 'll come if you rocket there right away . Why ? I have a surprise for you . Don 't you love me ? I don 't trust you . It 's your choice . Just be there . ( PRISONERS GROANING ) I demand to see the Governor . I can hardly breathe in this thing . Yes , you don 't look well , and I 'm told you refused your final meal . The chef will be upset . Tell him to go to hell . May be just as well . Gas works more quickly on an empty stomach . Any final request ? Yes , let me see Dale right away . Oh , dear . How pathetic . Yes , I anticipated that . Bring in the Emperor 's concubine . Oh , my God . Damn you ! I said , I want to see her ! You have until the sands run out . Pathetic . You look great . No kidding . You look great . It 's the eye makeup . I hope I remember the trick when I wake up . I 'll be darned . That 's exactly what I was going to tell you . What ? This isn 't happening , Dale . We 're not here . It 's just a bad dream . Oh , I agree completely . Why , we 'll wake up any minute in Dark Harbor and have a laugh about all this . Yeah , only , next time , I won 't just ask the maTtre d ' your name . I 'll walk over and talk to you . You promise ? I promise . Cross my heart and hope to ... I really will talk to you , Dale . Oh , what if we 're wrong , Flash ? We can 't be . What if it isn 't a dream ? Then you 'll find Zarkov . You 'll save the Earth somehow , and he 'll get you home in the Capsule . But what about you ? Don 't think of me , Dale . Think of the ... Flash . No , don 't . Don 't . Don 't look at it . It won 't turn over . It won 't turn over . Did you enjoy yourselves on Sybaria ? I understand you flew the doctor there last week . Klytus kindly fed me the information . Klytus ? He wants me himself . His agents are always making up lies about me . Look . Water is leaking from her eyes . It 's what they call tears . It 's a sign of their weakness . This will help you on your way . ( DRUM BEATING ) ( HISSING ) Flash ! Flash ! Flash ! ( MURMURING ) ( BELL TOLLING ) ( BUZZING ) Hurry . Do you realize what happens to me if I 'm found out ? You won 't be , I swear . I 'm a fool for you , Aura . There we are . Sybaria again ? Same place , next weekend ? I can hardly wait . Where am I ? Back from the dead . I 've saved you . My God ! How ? By magic , of course . With a kiss , because I like you . Where 's Dale and Zarkov ? Don 't worry about them . They 're safe now . Quickly , put this uniform on before the Lizard Men arrive to bury you . Don 't worry . I won 't look . I like you a lot . Where are you taking me ? To the moon Arboria . I don 't want to go to any moon . I 've got to rescue my friends and save the Earth . It 's pretty risky telling that to the Emperor 's daughter . What 's in Arboria ? People who 'll help you . Why ? Prince Barin does anything I ask . God , that 's Zarkov ! It 's nothing . They 're just Conditioning him to our climate . Keep out of sight . Do you want us both killed ? Trust me . Every thousand years , I test each life system in the universe . I visit it with mysteries , earthquakes , unpredicted eclipses , strange craters in the wilderness . If these are taken as natural , I judge that system ignorant and harmless . I spare it . But if the hand of Ming is recognized in these events , I judge that system dangerous to us . I call upon the great god , Dyzan , and for his greater glory and our mutual pleasure , I destroy it utterly . You 're saying it 's my fault Earth is being destroyed . Precisely , Doctor . I thought it might amuse you to know this before your mind is gone . Proceed with it . ( HUMMING ) What are you doing to me ? Oh , we 're just emptying your mind . What ? We are going to empty your memory as we might empty your pockets , Doctor . ZARKOV : No , don 't do that . Please , I beg you . My mind is all I have . I 've spent my whole life trying to fill it . Begin . Are you watching ? Goodbye , Munson . It 's an attack . Right all these years ! I resign / . Hilda ! Hilda ! MAN : / tis not surprising ... Hmm . Now , he showed promise . ( WOMAN SCREAM / NG ) ( GUNS F / R / NG ) ( EXPLOS / ONS ) ( LAUGH / NG ) Papa . Papa . ( WOMAN GROAN / NG ) Hold it there . Reprogram now ? Yes . But don 't fill him with anything above level three . I doubt if the human mind could take it . I understand . Level three only . There 's something I have to attend to . Will you be able to manage without me ? Rn try . I 'll return . Begin to reprogram . Continue to level six . Level six ? I gave you an order . Program the subject to level six . ( HUMMING LOUDLY ) Try again . Your left hand controls direction . Right does the altitude . And use your fingers , too , this time . Gently , darling , it 's extremely sensitive , like me . What 's that ? That 's the planet Aquaria . Now take a left turn over Frigia , that next moon rising . Every moon of Mongo is a kingdom . My father keeps them fighting each other constantly . It 's a really brilliant strategy . Why don 't they team up and overthrow him ? Team up ? What does that mean ? Maybe I 'll show you sometime . Wonderful . You can do that when I take you to Cythera . Where ? It 's my secret pleasure moon . I have a little palace there built just for two . Wait a minute , Aura . Oh , Flash , I saved your life . Drink this . What is it ? It has no name . Many brave men died to bring it here from the Galaxy of Pleasure . It 'll make your nights with Ming more agreeable . Will it make me forget ? No . But it will make you not mind remembering . Wow ! This isn 't bad at all . It 's a thought amplifier . I 'm going to think to Barin and tell him to expect us . You 're kidding . Think to him ? Of course . Don 't you have telepathy on Earth ? Hey , could I call Dale on this ? If I showed you how , but I 'm not going to . Please , show me how to tune in to Dale . You have to persuade me much better than that . What are you doing ? Are you mad ? Let me go . We 're diving into Frigia . Pull her up . Just tune me in to Dale . Okay - Dale , it 's me , Flash . Are you getting me ? Over . Oh , my head . Oh , Flash , if it only was you . She 's not getting me . Don 't use your mouth . Use your brain . I 'm with you , Dale . Just concentrate hard and think to me . It 's telepathy . Over . Can this be real ? I saw you executed . I was saved . I 'm still alive . Oh , thank God . Where are you ? In a rocket , racing to Arboria to get help . Are you okay ? Over . I 'm looked in Ming 's bedroom . Fake him out . How ? Girls know how , Dale . It 's been done to me . Fake him out till I get back . Over . It 's too dangerous for you here . You can 't come back . Stay where you 're safe . Oh , my God , this girl 's really turning me on . I didn 't quite get that . Think it again . Forget I thought it . It wasn 't about you . Over . What ? Hang up . I 've got to go . Where ? Someone 's coming . We 've got to stop thinking to each other . His Imperial Highness will be here very soon . Shall I pour ? Please . Wouldn 't you like a sip ? Oh , no , it 's forbidden for us slaves . Oh , believe me , honey , that 's quality stuff . Have some . Listen , we 're all girls here . I won 't tell . Just one sip . Live a little , huh ? Bottoms up . What is your name ? Hans Zarkov . Agent Zarkov , number 2133 of the imperial anti-insurgent espionage group . Hail , Ming ! Good . AURA : It 's not usually so bad this time of year . How far to the landing pad ? 6.4 . I 'll drop the flaps a little . ( MOANING ) You ! Hey , over here ! Hey , buddy . ( COMPUTERS BEEPING ) I 've got her . Where ? Sector 409 Eta . Activate Agent Zarkov . ( BEEPING ) DALE : Oh , Dr. Zarkov , are you a sight for sore eyes ! ZARKO V : Easy , girl . Rest a minute . No , I can 't rest . We 've got to get out of here and join up with Flash . KLYTUS : Flash ? He 's alive . I talked to him by telepathy . He went to Arboria to get us help . Arboria ? Incredible . There 's soldiers everywhere . What ' / / we do ? Let me think a moment . Unseal the city . Allow her to exit with Agent Zarkov . I think I can find a safe way out . Are you sure ? No questions , dear . Just follow me . I have located Dale Arden . She 's under the guidance of Agent Zarkov . But Flash Gordon is still alive . Alive ! He was revived by a traitor and spirited from the city . We know this from the Earth girl . What traitor ? I have my suspicions , but I need your authority to pursue them my way . Stop at nothing . No matter to whom the trail leads ? I said , at nothing . FLASH : What 's that over there ? Their sacred temple . A young man is being initiated , but we must hide outside till it 's done . ( DRUMS BEATING ) ( BOY PANTING ) I love initiations . I am now of age , Green Father . I ask for the test of manhood . Choose your passage into this world or the next . May Arbor guide you . ( SCREAMING ) Send me on my way . Spare me the madness . Iwill . Hold him . ( BOY GRUNTING ) This guy is gonna help me ? Stay . That was extremely moving . You came ! I do sometimes keep a promise . Prepare a feast . No , not for me . I have to get back right away before I 'm missed . Get back right away ? Then why did you come ? I brought you a present . Flash . Hello . Welcome back from the grave . I knew you were up to something , though I confess I hadn 't thought of necrophilia . All I want you to do is keep him for me until my father has had his way with Dale Arden . I 'll keep him for you , all right , in my larder . Take him along with the rest of the hanging meat . No , Barin , I forbid it . If you kill Flash , you√ºlnever have me again . What danger is there ? Everyone thinks he 's dead . I swear , I 'll take him away to Cythera next week . Harboring a fugitive from Ming is treason . That 's only an excuse , Barin . You 're not frightened of Ming . You are playing with fire , Aura . Of course I am . Does anyone ever trust her twice ? DALE : So that 's why they let us escape . Klytus thought he 'd wiped out your memory . But do you know why it really failed ? I can 't imagine . As I was going under , I started to recite Shakespeare , the Talmud , the formulas of Einstein , anything I could remember , even a song from The Beatles . It armored me , girl . They couldn 't wipe those things away . You can 't beat the human spirit . ( SCREAMS ) Prince Barin , I 'm not your enemy . Ming is . And you know it yourself . Ming is the enemy of every creature on Mongo . Let 's all team up and fight him . Lower them into the swamp . We can do it , Barin . Your lover , Barin , is harboring Gordon in Arboria . Is he not ? No . This lying is such a waste of time . You left with a pilot and returned alone . Wasn 't he Gordon in disguise ? No ! Who do you imagine you 're protecting ? The imperial surgeon who revived Gordon in his tomb ? Another lover of yours ? Yourjealousy of me has made you mad . Seize the imperial surgeon on suspicion of treason . You 're mad ! Prepare for torture . Confess and we won 't hurt you anymore . We don 't like doing this at all . Neven . Bring me the bore worms . No , not the bore worms ! I 'm a princess of the blood , Klytus . My father will have your head for this . I swear , he 'll execute your whole perverted secret police force . I demand to see him ! With pleasure . Father . The traitor is close to confession , Your Majesty . Should we stop the torture ? No . Father ! Damn you , Father ! ( FLUTE PLAYING ) That damned woman is using me again . Well , what do you expect of Ming 's daughter ? I 've never understood what you see in her . Keep playing your bloody pipes , fool . Fico , I 'm going to kill Gordon now . And lose the Princess Aura forever ? There must be a way to dispose of the earthling and keep faith with the Princess . There is . I 'm sorry , Flash . I 'm finished . No , you 're not . Get up . Look ! Look , someone 's coming . BARIN : Send him over . Hurry up . Hold on . It 's no good , Flash . I can 't hold on . Yes , you can . Go on , and get in . Sleep well , you traitor . We hang you in the morning . That 's the spirit . There 's always hope . This is better than hope . I stole a key to this cage . We 'll need weapons to cross the swamp . They 're stored in the temple . Do you want to climb up with me ? Hold on , Hawkman . We 'll be right back . Nice confession . I commend you . Execute her ? No , too kind . Aura will be banished to Frigia the day after my wedding . One year in a cavern of ice will cool her blood . And then , who knows ? Perhaps we will marry her to someone worthy of her treacherous nature . Your Majesty , how can I express my gratitude ? Easily , Klytus . Get me Gordon and Barin . With pleasure . Hans , look ! Hey , Vultan ! Not now . You 're going to love this . See what Brave Blue has caught . Hi , Prince Vultan . Remember us ? Indeed I do , my lovely . VULTAN : Call the Emperor . Tell him I have prisoners for him . You wouldn 't . Are you mad , Vultan ? You hate Ming . I know you 're only waiting for the right moment to attack him . Yes , and Ming knows that , too , so , by delivering you , I allay his suspicions . I gain time . Our weapons are inferior . We need another year 's preparation . Ming 's not unbeatable . With all his men , he couldn 't even kill Flash . Gordon 's alive ? He 's in Arboria . Prince Barin is aiding him . VULTAN : Barin . I tell you , now is the time to strike . Where are the weapons ? Feelone . Do you know where you are ? Up the creek . You have trespassed where only a Tree Man may enter . A stranger in this temple must try the wood beast or die . That figures . ( BEAST HISSING ) You came here of your own free will , earthling . However , because of my word to Aura , I swear by the great god Arbor , I 'll not kill you unless you beg me to . The beast lies somewhere in the stump . Choose a passage . No way . Coward . Let 's do it . Must be my lucky day . You scared ? What would Aura think of you now ? Second down . Your play . No , yours . Are you sure these are the rules ? They 've just been changed . ( GROANS ) ( GROANING ) Death is certain but only after tortured madness . How long ? Hours , days , depending on your strength . Please , end it now . Tricked you , Barin . Back off . One move , and you 're looking for a new prince . Leave him ! He 's mine . I hunt him alone . ( EXCLAIMS ) ( ROARING ) ( FLASH EXCLAIMING ) This is one grave you won 't be returning from . Vultan wants a word with you , Barin . Excuse me for waking you . We 've scanned a Hawkman patrol 400 Mongo miles east . They have Gordon and Prince Barin . What 's our arrival time at Vultan 's kingdom ? Estimating 16 . Wake me when it 's in sight . Yes , sir . You 'd sell us to Ming ? Come on , Barin , do you expect mercy here ? What would you do if I were captive in your kingdom ? I would remind you of article 17 of Ming 's law . " No prince of Mongo taken captive shall be offered for ransom " " without first being given the right of trial by combat . " Is there such an article ? I 'm afraid there is . What a damned nuisance ! Mmm , yes , and who do you choose to fight ? Him . This place is a lunatic asylum . I wonder where we 're being taken now ? I 'm calculating . What ? Time remaining before the moon crashes on Earth . I 'd say very roughly 14 hours , 9 minutes and 20 seconds . Oh , God . We haven 't even found ... Flash ! Oh , it 's so crazy . Last time I saw you , I prayed it was a dream . This time I 'm praying it 's not . Are you okay ? I am now . Me , too . Boy , have I got some crazy stories to tell you . Save them for our kids . Oh , I accept . Enough ! Would you leave us alone ? I just got engaged . Let the combat begin ! To the death ! ( ALL SHOUTING ) ALL : Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Give me the remote control . Come on . ( VU LTAN LAUGHING ) Zarkov , he 's tilting it . Come on . DALE : Flash , watch out ! ALL : Die ! Die ! Die ! Die . DALE : You got him ! VULTAN : Present from Vultan ! Brute ! Give me that . Bastard . Flash ! Vultan ! Attaboy , Flash ! VULTAN : Come on , boy , finish him ! Finish him ! VULTAN : Get up ! Get up ! Get up ! En garde ! VULTAN : Come on , now ! Murder him ! Bash him ! ALL : Flash ! Flash ! Flash ! Flash ! VULTAN : Move ! Don 't stand there . Move ! Move ! Come on ! Vultan ! Vultan ! DALE : Flash ! Flash ! Flash , I love you , but we only have 14 hours to save the Earth . Flash ! Come on ! Here 's a taste of oblivion . How 's that feel , Arborian ? ALL : Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Promise me , if you kill me , you 'll team up with Vultan and fight Ming . VU LTAN : Goodbye , Barin . Take my hand . Come on . You 've won . Let him go . Come on , you can do it . That 's it , Prince . What is this ? Humanity . Madness ! Oh , Flash . Where you go , I follow . Listen to me ! Listen ! There is something finer in this galaxy than Ming 's law . Rubbish ! ( ALARM BLARING ) Hawkmen , to your posts ! Agent Zarkov , you will be liquidated for treachery . Vultan , you will surrender these fugitives at once , or the imperial fleet will blast your kingdom to atoms . Step forward , Barin . Address me as Prince Barin . No longer . Princess Aura , under our persuasion , has implicated you on a charge of high treason . You 're under arrest . A prison ship will be here shortly to take you away . You tortured Aura ? An interesting girl . I think she found it rather enjoyable . Klytus . Flash ! The first step forward . Into the air , my Hawk People ! Take whatever you can carry . Fly for your lives ! You young hothead ! You 've brought down destruction on my kingdom . No , Vultan . He has shown us the way . Stand with us and fight . Against the imperial fleet ? It 's the perfect time . They won 't expect visitors . We 'll take them by surprise . We can do it , Vultan . You 're all mad . My duty is to protect my Hawk People . Evacuate ! Fly ! DALE : Then take us with you . Impossible . There 's already much more than we can carry . BARIN : You 're leaving us to die . You know Ming 's law , Barin . Outside his own kingdom , the hunter becomes the hunted . BARIN : Traitor ! VU LTAN : Save your breath , Barin . Evacuate ! Fly ! HAWKMAN : Fly ! Dale , help me pull these down . Flash . We 'll make parachutes and jump to Arboria . Flash , it must be 50 miles down . We 'll kill ourselves . Oh , no , no , no problem . A body reaches maximum Velocity within a few hundred feet . We 'll need some rope . Here . ( RUMBLING ) My God , what is that ? Come on . It 's Ming . He 'll blow us to atoms . We must stop him . Blast them ? Not yet . Send down a shuttle , bring back Barin and Zarkov , Dale Arden . And Gordon ? No , leave him there . Prepare my imperial lander . FLASH : Why aren 't I going with them ? I 've got other plans for you . I can imagine . You want to destroy me . Ihaveto . It 's the only way to save Earth . What if I granted you a kingdom ? If you what ? Ming the Merciless , ruler of the universe , here and now , offers Flash Gordon a kingdom of Mongo to rule over as his own . You 're crazy . Why would you do that ? Because I 've never before met your like . You 're a hero . Don 't you see that ? Who better than you to rule a kingdom ? Your moon is drifting very close now . Earth 's end might come within hours . You 'd call off the attack ? I could . Everyone would be saved ? Yes and no . After the earthquakes and tidal waves , they won 't be quite the human beings you remember . They 'll be more tractable , easier for you to rule in the name of Ming . You mean slaves ? Let 's say they 'll be satisfied with less . What about Dale ? Dale ? We have decided to marry her . She 's exceptional . We will breed with her and send our imperial progeny back to populate your Earth . You really prefer death to a kingdom ? I 'm disappointed . I 'd much rather see you on my side than scattered into atoms . But as you wish . We shall return to the imperial rocket . Leave the earthling here to his doom . Beam another blast . You murderer . ( EXCLAIMS ) Flash , I loved you . They were brave Creatures , Vultan . Shut up . With respect , the man who rid us of Klytus should not be deserted . Will you shut up ? So . Maybe I 'd do it different if I had it over again . Then fight ! But there 's no way I can help a man Who 's dead . Flash Gordon to Vultan . Do you read me ? Mayday . Mayday . Huh ? This is Vultan . I read you . Where are you ? Flying blind on a rocket cycle . Flying blind on a rocket cycle ? We are in Arboria . L ' / I send you a homing beam . Thanks , Vultan . Hey , for what it 's worth , Ming 's got Dale , Zarkov and Barin . I see . My thanks to you . Yeah ? What for ? Well , for giving a dumb old bird a second chance . Over to homing beam . ( WHOOPING ) Don 't touch me . Oh , you ! No ! I 'm a prisoner , too . You damned Mongo person . You couldn 't tell the truth to save your life . Dale , stop . I 'm going to be exiled in the morning . Liar ! Oh , yeah ? You liar ! ( EXCLAIMS ) Is this another trick , Aura ? Is this a trick ? Could tears come from my eyes if my heart hadn 't changed ? I 've been such a spoiled fool . I never knew what my father was until he let Klytus put bore worms on me . I believe you , Aura , but I don 't trust you . You have Ming 's blood in your veins . You 'll be cozying up with him again in the morning . Not if you give him this . It 's deadly poison . My father always drinks a power potion before he makes love . Drop this into his glass tonight . I can 't , Aura . I gave your father my word of honor . What word ? To try and be a good wife if he 'd spare Zarkov and Barin . He vowed he would . My father has never kept a vow in his life . I can 't help that . Keeping our word is one of the things that make us better than you . A guard will take you to the waiting room . Yourjoyous time has come . Follow us . You are to be prepared for your wedding . You are to be prepared for your wedding . I 'm lost , Aura . Nothing can save me now . General Kala . Flash Gordon approaching . What do you mean , " Flash Gordon approaching " ? On a Hawkman rocket cyc / e . Shall I inform His Majesty ? Imbecile . The Emperor would shoot you for interrupting his wedding with this news . Fire when Gordon 's in range . KALA : He 's escaping , idiot . Dispatch War Rocket Ajax to bring back his body . Charge the boosters . Flash Gordon in range , Captain . Fire . Shall we go in after him , Captain ? No , reduce velocity . Vultan , our trap play worked . They 'll follow me for sure . Good . Stand by , my Hawkmen ! He 's not coming out , sir . Charge capacitators to electrify cloud . Prepare sky nets to catch Gordon 's body . Fire capacitators . ( LAUGHING ) They 're trying to flush you out . Okay , let 's go in after him . Good , they 're coming through . Squadron 40 , dive ! Arm topside ! Fire ! Second wave , dive ! Stop all engines . Repel boarders . Biro 's hit . I 'm going in after him . Impetuous boy ! Oh , well , who wants to live forever ? Dive ! Dive ! Die ! Biro , hold on . I 'm coming . Biro , you all right ? They just winged me . Detonate the mine . Right . Blow it , Flash ! Come on , let 's get out of here . Well done , Flash . Here , you 'll need this . Up there , Luro . This way , Flash . Come on . Full Velocity , all drives . Die ! VU LTAN : Head cracker ! Die ! KALA : Attention , all citizens . Behold the face of your Empress-to-be . ALL : Hail , Ming ! Hail , Ming ! Hail ! While you await the ceremony , all channels will display , for your entertainment , the execution of the traitors , Barin and Zarkov . Pick that up , would you ? ( SCREECHING ) Tell me more about this man , Houdini . This is it , Zarkov . At least it will be over quickly . ( SHUSHING ) Scanner malfunction . Area 77 Delta under repair . They 've changed the code . I 've changed , too , Aura . And I 've changed , too . Oh , it 's okay . I think I can work it out . I love you . Will you marry me ? I don 't know . We 'll try . Not now , Barin . You haven 't changed . If I 'm not at the wedding , I 'll be shot . I thought it was one of the prime numbers of the Zeeman series . I haven 't changed . All right , everybody , take off ! Form into a battle stream behind the rocket . Flash and me bail out when the shooting starts , and , Biro , remember to keep your head down . See you in Mingo City , Prince . Yes , With luck . Flash , what are you setting there ? That 's how long Earth has left , according to Zarkov , in minutes and seconds . Level with me , Vultan . Will this do it ? Yes , no doubt . There 's a lightning field across the entrance . When this baby hits it , boom ! All the fuel and everything . It will blow that field dead . My Hawkmen fly right in . Come . Let 's see what Mingo City 's saying . ( BRIDAL MARCH PLAYING ) Oh , my God . Rocket Ajax returning . With Gordon 's body ? I presume so . Communications are off for some reason . Are they in the proper approach pattern for today ? Negative , they are not . Open fire . On Ajax , General ? Open fire ! All weapons ! Now ! Charge the lightning field . I take personal responsibility in the Emperor 's name . Attention , all wedding guests . There is no cause for a / arm . The city 's weapons are being fired in continuous salute in honor of His Imperial Majesty 's Wedding . Come on , Flash . Come on , it 's time to bail out . I 'm sorry , Vultan . I 'm not coming . What ? My rocket cycle 's gone . So , come on , I 'll carry you . Bail out , Vultan , before it 's too late . Flash , are you crazy ? The fire 's too heavy . You know we 'll never make that opening with nobody at the wheel . Come on , you 'll be blown to pieces , Flash . It 's suicide . No , a rational transaction . One life for billions . Come on , you 'll be destroyed . You loony bird , get out of here . They need you on the ground . Well , goodbye , Flash . It 's been ... I know . For me , too , Vultan . Tell Dale I know it would 've been good . That must be one hell of a planet you men come from . Not too bad . Onward , my brave Hawkmen ! Let this be known forever as Flash Gordon 's day . Freeze , you bloody bastards ! Freeze ! Take us to Ming . We do not lead traitors to the Imperial Presence . We 'll find a way . Grab an imager off one of those agents . ( SYSTEMS SHUTTING DOWN ) Zarkov ! Thank you . Rocket Ajax still approaching . Life-form scanners identify earthling Gordon at the Controls . We guarantee its destruction when it reaches the lightning fields . General Kala . General Kala , will you please show yourself on my screen ? Let 's go . Wait . We 've got to deactivate the lightning field . Where are the atomic generators ? There 's no time . They 're six miles underground . I 'm heading for Sector Alpha Nine . Hold the fort . There has to be a way of deactivating the lightning field . ALL : Hail , Ming ! Hail , Ming ! Hail , Ming ! Do you , Ming the Merciless , ruler of the universe , take this earthling , Dale Arden , to be your Empress of the hour ? Of the hour , yes . Do you promise to use her as you will ? Certainly . Not to blast her into space until such time as you grow weary of her ? I do . I do not . Recite after me , Your Majesty . " With this ring ... " Master ... Ring . Ring . Ring . Ring . Recite after me , Your Majesty . " With this ring , I thee wed . " Dale , what a damn shame . Freeze ! Deactivate the lightning field . ( ALL MURMURING ) Gordon ! Flash ? Go , Flash ! The game 's lost , Ming . Stop your attack on Earth , and I 'll spare your life . You pitiful fool . My life is not for any earthling to give or take . Your power 's fading , Ming . ( BEEPING ) The reactors are destroyed . Glad you made it , Vultan . Better late than never . Dale ! Look out , Flash ! DALE : Flash , don 't move . Stay where you are . Long live Flash . You 've saved your Earth . Have a nice day . Yeah ! ( FLASH 'S THEME PLAYING ) Barin is the rightful heir . ALL : Hail , Barin , King of Mongo ! We owe everything to Flash . ALL : Hail , Flash ! We appoint Vultan general of our armies . ALL : Yeah ! Hail , Vultan ! From this day on , let every breed of Mongo live together in peace . Hail , Barin ! Will we ever get out of here , Hans ? I don 't know , but we 'll try . We certainly invite you all to stay . What do you think ? I 'm a New York City girl . It 's a little too quiet around here for me . ( MING LAUGHING EVILLY )

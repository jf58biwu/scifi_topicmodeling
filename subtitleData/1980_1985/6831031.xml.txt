 Sons of bitches ! Dammit ! Eat this ! Hey ! Dammit ! pal . so the spaceport will be ... Shall we rest here ' til things settle down a bit ? What ? ! No way ! It can 't be ! What 's the matter ? — The Bonanza 's been destroyed ! — What ? ! It 's been blown up ! And the spaceport 's been shut down ! Damn ! Must be those guys from before ! What shall we do ? hell ! I 'm just about ready to pack it in ... We 've got to go a long distance with a cumbersome cargo . no matter what the cost ! A person 's life ? ! How disquieting ! There 's a person who 's balanced between life and death ... I want to request that you save her . but we 're not doctors . Mr. Valenstinos ? you can still get her to the doctors . Just about anybody could do that ! Why do you need to hire Crushers to do such a job ? The person I want you to save is a lady by the name of Elena . She is in a cryogenic suspension coma ... she will die . of the planet Miccola . Miccola is about 5000 light years away . That 's only three or four warp jumps . it 'll be a piece of cake . The problem is not one of ships or of distance . what is it ? Ms. Elena is an heir of a certain industrial super group . but she has been raised to become the leader of the group . she fell ill ... the factions of the group are in conflict . a family squabble . Exactly . We have encountered a great deal of interference . Why don 't you contact the United Space Force ? Huh ? The United Space Force . they 'll probably give you a battleship as escort ! they won 't charge you like we Crushers will . It 's a great deal . — I can 't do that ! — Why not ? ! That would make this a public matter . It 'd ruin the public 's trust in our conglomerate . Oh ? So corporate P.R. is more important than her life ? Now that 's hard for me to accept . I am sure that she would agree with me . that 's the kind of training she has received . Can you at least tell us who Elena really is ? Ms. Elena Scorlan . eh ? No wonder they 'd be worried about their public image . They 're one of the top 10 industrial groups in the entire Galaxy . And ? Who are you ? My family have been stewards to the Scorlans for three generations . — Can you prove that ? — Yes . How 's ... this ? This is the special name card of the Scorlans . This is the real thing ! so she 's seen cards like this before . that 's very nice ! Talos ... sir . How much time ' til our next job ? Let 's see now ... I 'd say just about 250 hours . So much for our vacation then . you will take this assignment ? It won 't be cheap though ... everything 's okay . so I ask that you remain in your cabin until we reach our destination . — Will that be a problem ? — Not at all ! It 's amazing how easily we were able to get away ! a little courage too . you Crushers are truly the best ! yes ! This is for you ... 000 . sirs . Please verify that it is correct . How are our guests ? They seemed better than I expected . The space sickness drug must be working . but maybe they 're used to being aboard a spaceship . Hmm ... As long as they remain well until we get to Miccola ... Who cares ! They wanted to ride in a Crusher ship . It 's not like we can gently warp out like some cruise liner ... start the warp countdown . Sure thing . please . Okay ! 60 ... 50 ... 40 ... — Synchronisation normal ! — 30 ... Warp coordinates ... set ! — Power nominal ! — 20 ... 10 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 ... 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... Engage warp ! Warp engaged ! 10 ... 20 ... 30 ... still nominal . — 40 ... 50 ... — All green here . — 60 ... 70 ... 80 ... Wait ! Something 's wrong here ! — It 's out of sync ! — What ? ! Oh ! Abnormal power indication ! It 's all messed up ! check the engines ! Data is all normal ! But we 're losing sync ! it 's uncorrectable ! The ship isn 't broken ! Space itself is ! Disengage autopilot ! No use ! I don 't know what 's going on ! All systems off ! Disengage everything ! Dammit ! Talos ! Joe ... did we have a black out or something ? what do we have here ? Didn 't realise we were out of warp . I wonder ? I don 't have a clue ... Are you all right ? My head hurts . I feel pukey ! so we humans ... — Humans ! — Joe ! Passengers ! Hey ! Passengers ! There 's no response . Looks like the on-board cameras are out too . Do you think ... our guests are ... you try to figure out our current location . Talos ! It 's empty . They might be in the cargo hold . Right ! They might be concerned about their cargo . It 's empty . The device holding Elena is ... gone . This can 't be for real . check out the on-board mass meter ! Operating ? It 's normal ? And ? I see . I gotcha . Joe ... They 're gone ... the passengers and Elena 's capsule . That can 't be ! get up here quickly ! We 've figured out where we are ! Good ! I 'll be right there . 1181 ... Right in the middle of a trade route . We 're off by 700 light years ! That 's weird ! the energy levels aren 't down even a little bit ! That means ... we were carried here ... Sheesh ! Beats the hell out of me ! Joe ! Abnormal gravitational wave readings ! A ship is coming out of warp ! Put it on the main screen ! 000 km from here . It 's come out of warp . Just one ship . We 're being signalled ! They 're asking us to open a communications channel . sir . Oh ! These energy readings ! Blasters ! Damn ! you pirates ! our next shot will vaporise you ! You idiot ! Are you blind or something ? ! Can 't you see the Comet mark ? ! We 're not pirates . We 're Crushers ! you rats ! You 're all the same ! S ... Say what ? ! We will now inspect your ship . Let me be clear ... one false move and you 'll be eating hot photons ! Got it ? ! Wh ... What kinda crap was that ? ! It pisses me off ! They 're approaching fast ! Looks like they 're serious . Let 's take them on and blow them away ! Nobody is watching us anyway ! you amoeba brain ! That 's a battleship ... and combat is their trade ! We wouldn 't stand a chance . Dammit ! Dammit ! But ... what shall we do ? ! We 'll let them inspect us ... after all . commander of the USF 's 3rd Inspection Unit . Let us see your ship 's registration and the roster of crew members . Are you the captain ? I 'm the team leader ... Crusher Joe . not a place for scum like you to hang out . What is your destination and mission ? Our destination is Miccola ... Our mission is ... to transport a patient . Miccola ? ! A patient ? ! Do you Crushers run an ambulance service too ? What is a ship that 's headed for Miccola doing here ? ! there 're reasons for that ... Where 's the patient ? ! Sh ... She 's not here now ... She disappeared ! What do you mean disappeared ? ! you won 't get away with it ! whether you like it or not ! We 're the ones who wanna know exactly what happened ! There 's been an increase in pirate activity in this sector . We had to put out a cordon on an emergency basis . Looks like we 've caught what we were fishing for . What 's that supposed to mean ? ! Do you think we 're lying ? ! You gotta be outta yer mind if you think I 'll buy that lame story ! will ya ? Who the hell are you ? We 've got contract documents and money . Please examine them . Huh ? I 'm telling you ! eh ? I 'll go get ' em ! — Gaston ... — Sir ! — Go with him . — Yes sir ! aren 't you ? they 're all gone ! Looks like we 've gotten to the heart of the matter ! you 'll now be escorted to our headquarters on Stargis . { } { } { } { } we made inquiries with the Opus Police . Wanna know their answer ? No ! but they say they 've never heard of you . Isn 't it about time you tell us what 's really going on ? So what do you think we should say ? We haven 't lied to you at all ! but you 're the stubbornest of the entire lot ! but you 're the first rockhead I 've come across ! Silence ! you 're wrong ! pal ! Listen to me ... lock them up until they confess ! sir ! That naïve fool ! Who the hell does he think he is ? Colonel ... I see you 've got quite a handful . it 's you . The Office of the Attorney General has made their decision . right ? — No . They 're dropping the charges . Eh ? What the ? ! we 'll just see what happens after they 're released . What a dumb idea ! you can bag them all in one fell swoop . the rats will be out of the bag ! That depends on how skilful you are . Get off my case ! now . I have dedicated ... 20 years of my life to exterminating pirates ! I don 't have to take any crap from the likes of you ! fine . then I guess I 'll go see someone else . Y ... Ya tryin ' to make me buy this ? ! Their headquarters on Aramis will be giving them a suspension order . That 's when we 'll dangle our lure . you know ? I 'll go along with this ! Now that 's the stalwart commander of the Gordova that I know ! you rat ! Don 't kiss up to me ! 948 ) \ fnArial \ fs72 } Planet Aramis flights would usually be cancelled . I am worried about the potential for mid-air accidents . so we cannot take any chances ! sir ! Why not just use the regular channels to deliver the council 's decision ? to deliver it in person ! How about putting Article 24 into effect ? so ... What ? I can 't hear you ... I 'll be back by the day after tomorrow . Organise the agenda for our next meeting ! they release us ... Just what the heck is going on ? ! sir . The decision was made at a higher level . then at least say so ! please ask your attorney to file a protest . Ha ! Whatever ! That 's pretty much how things work on this planet . please . Long time no see ... Joe . Dad ! S ... S ... Sir ! What 's the matter ? Don 't just stand there . Have a seat . Why are you here ? ! regarding the recent incident . It has to be some kinda mistake ! then it 's gotta be some kinda set-up ! Crushers must not involve themselves in illegal activities . Aramis HQ must approve all urgent missions . You have violated this regulation . We had no time ! It was an emergency ... someone 's life was at stake ! Excuses . I will hear none of them . The Crusher Council has placed you under a 6 month license suspension . Go back to Aramis and reflect upon your misdeeds . S ... Sir ! Th ... That 's unreasonable ! Talos ! you have failed . You should know more than anyone here just how things are done ! Y ... Yes sir . That 's all I have to say for now . dig it ! The night is young ! The night is long ! You 've got a full night ahead of you ! Argh ! License suspension ? ! 6 months ? ! Ha ! I 've never heard of HQ needing to approve of emergency jobs ! I guess . Emergencies are called emergencies because they emerge with urgency ! nothing would get done ! Exactly ! what can I say ... it 's all my fault ... Don 't be ridiculous ! We ain 't responsible for any of this ! We were trying to save a life ! A life ! if I had only gotten in touch with Aramis HQ sooner ... Aramis that ! What 's so special about Aramis ? ! We 're Crushers because we like it ! Why the hell then can 't we do anything unless we see smiles on their faces ? ! you had too much to drink ... Shut up ! And butt out ! mind your own business . Joe ! I think it 'd be better if you don 't ... ' cause you 'll ... Got a problem ? ! you little brat ! you baby ! Oh my ... guys and gals ? Have fun ! Have fun ! Have lots and lots of fun ! Get down ! Get down ! Shake your booties ! What 's with that old fart ? ! Can you believe that he 's Joe 's father ? ! They 're not alike at all ! He 's no gentleman ... he 's a tight wad ! you see ... Don 't say it ! " One of the founders of the Crusher trade ... the nation of Crushers . he 's my father . it 's not good for you to be so moody ... Moody my butt ! Sheesh ! Why did my dad have to drag himself all the way from Aramis ? ! I admit that I goofed up . That Va ... Val ... Valenstinos . that punk made us look like fools ! silly incident . he had to come just to tell us the Council 's decision in person ! He 's dissing us ! He thinks that I 'm still inexperienced ! Aren 't you jumping to conclusions a little ? No I 'm not ! Exactly ! It 's just the kind of thing that old tight wad would do ! I was just wondering ... Huh ? What is it ? Got a problem ? ! not really ... just pipe down ! I 'm sure that 's not the way your father is thinking . so ... after all ! Joe ... I don 't want you to butt in . my dad is my dad . I choose to live my own life ! then go back to Aramis right now ! Why don 't you just team up with him like you used to ? ! Joe ... Joe ... Why don 't we dance ? Like there 's no tomorrow ! let 's ! Yeah ! does it ? Nope ... Headquarters went overboard as well . not sent the Council president ! Ha ! Don 't be so presumptuous ! There are things called circumstances that brats like you don 't understand . Don 't talk to me like that ! That 's how Joe got PO 'ed to begin with ! Clueless brats should just shut up ! you know ! Why you ... you bed wetting brat ! no ! It 's Joe ! — It 's Joe ! Take that ! You butthead ! Oops ... There ! Another one ! Yeah ! Yeah ! How 's that ? ! It 's a fight ! — Joe ! — Let 's party ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Take your fight somewhere else ! man ! Please ... Please have mercy ! folks ! Don 't be too rough ... Yahoo ! Joe ! the cops ! we gotta split ! Joe ! You ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! aren 't you ? Hold still ! destroying an entire disco is a little too much ! you give a new meaning to the term Crushers ! too . You 're absolutely right about that . eh ? I get nostalgic thinking about the days I teamed up with you and Joe 's dad . what 're you doing these days ? I 'm with the Space Force . I 'm a Lt. Colonel . eh ? 2nd Unit . You know what that means ? eh ? That 's an overstatement ... though it 's just about the same thing ! I don 't think it 's a total coincidence that we ran into each other ... What is it that you want ? I read Kowalsky 's report ... and I thought I might be able to help you out ... What ? ! there 's a way to prove we 're innocent ? I 'm not sure . But I can give you a lead in that direction . A lead ? haha ! } what happened ? it had been stolen . Stolen ? ! Yeah . They were so worried about their reputation that they didn 't report it . This guy is the thief . Does he look familiar ? No ... does this face ring any bells ? and has a long record ... and managed to become the Scorlans ' secretary . Where the hell is he now ? ! he disappeared . Nobody knows his whereabouts ? we know where he went to . Where ? ! He fled to Lagol . Lagol ? ! Lagol ? that Lagol ? ! Yes ... The Lagol that 's in a solar system in the Aries Sector . it 's also an outlaw society . so shiploads of criminals and suspects keep pouring in . it 's an ideal hideout . Lagol restricts entry by various Treaty members ... as they want to handle everything locally . we can 't go in . However ... However ? It 's a different story for Crushers . Bard ! Joe ! Don 't forget that we 've been suspended for 6 months and been recalled ! We will go back to Aramis . you know ? I think that 's what they call poor judgement ... Poor judgement is still judgement . Bard ! I 'm gonna stop by Lagol ! That 's fine by me . okay ? You cheater . so ... Lagol ... All right ! Those rats ! Shall we go ? Yeah ! Joe ? Damn right ! We 'll dig those rats out of their hole ! All right ! I 'll go do the preflight checks . you go with him . I 'll go get our transit visas . let 's go ! Okay ! Kowalsky ? The Minerva has just left . Their destination is Lagol . They 'll be in orbit soon . You take it from here . Lagol ? ! Now that 's a tough place to go to . Don 't act too fast now . Follow them as far as you can . after all . you really are too honest for your own good ! Leave it to me . you punks ! Warp out ! all normal . Energy Gauge is also normal . right ? is the one that 's been terraformed . that means it 's still ... anyway . I hear that Crusher Kevin 's team did the mods up to Class 2 . he 'd be perfect for that . there 's not many planetoid remodelling jobs around these days . Please state the name on your entry visa . SV-06542-8A ... The Minerva . are in our registry . Please dock at Orbital Station X-483 . Dock ... at the station ? That is correct . There will be an entry inspection . Roger . We 'll dock at Orbital Station X-483 . Over and Out . Bye ! Now that 's unusual . A landing inspection at the station . but they 're picky about visitors . Pretty weird place . Definitely a spooky neighbourhood . okay . ready to depart . Gate open ! please proceed . 5 minutes to departure . Please complete the final checklist . { lol at the rat running there } Your turn ! Er ... wait a sec ! It 's that ship ! Ha ! What a junk heap ! eh ? they 're not your average Crushers . Kenny and I used them to carry the cargo . They must 've come after me ! Yosef . No way ! We took every possible precaution ! Then how do you explain that ? Mister Yosef ! Would you knock it off ? ! Bluebeard Nero ... then we 'll eliminate them . right ? — Y ... Yes . Interesting ... I always wanted to play with some Crushers . and your entry is approved . Please wait in the lobby until you are escorted down . — That was a breeze ! — Yeah . that was such a crude inspection . — Who the hell was that ? ! — Talk about awful driving ! those are Crushers ? ! They 're only little brats ! Huh ? Nero ! as always ! You shouldn 't keep all the fun for yourself ! this place is better than I expected . we 're continuing to descend ... What 's wrong ? the beacons are out ! Over here too ! What 's going on here ? Did something go wrong ? wait ... I 'm reading ships at bearing 2B-912 . Beneath us ! 8 of them in all . They 're small fighters . evasive action ! sir ! Talk about a warm welcome . Combat positions ! Let 's give them a fight ! Now that 's how I like it ! Not bad ... You must not underestimate them . Now the battle really begins ! 2 ships ! Heading straight for us ! Morons ! Gotcha ! they 're good ! We 're outnumbered ! Alfin and I will fly Fighter-1 ! take over ! — Right on ! — Let 's go ! — Yeah ! Joe ! Over there ! We 've got trouble ! We 're losing power fast ! We 'll cover you ! Head for the spaceport ! B ... But ... now ! It 's 4-to-1 ! You 're in the way ! Beat it ! Joe ! Not yet ! There 's still a tough one left ! This one 's stubborn ! How 's this ? ! Smart-ass ! Joe ! Hold on tight ! or what ? ! then go home ! Nonsense ! What kind of girl do you think I am ? Don 't get cocky ! Move it ! You klutz ! Watch where you 're flying ! Look who 's talking ! Are you blind ? ! you idiot ? ! — You 're the idiot ! you ... Wimp ! Loser ! Alfin ? Yeah ... Dammit ! The engines ! You were too rough on them ! We 're going down ! Dammit ! quick ! What 're we gonna do now ? Who knows ? Watch out ! Abandon ship immediately ! Calm down ! I need to get this ship repaired fast . Get real ! Your ship 's gonna explode ! Don 't worry about that . I just need to get it flying again fast . You 're out of your mind ! I 'll pay ! Just shut up and get the mechanics out here ! Talos ! We 're getting an emergency message ! Not now ! Do what we say and get out of there ! Do what I say and get maintenance ! Damn those firemen ! They 'll wreck the engines ! Why you ! is it not ? — Who the hell are you ? I 'm the chief secretary to President Mardola of Lagol . I got no time to deal with you ! Put that spaceport guy back on again ! I have a message for you from the President . Give it to me later ! Get me the other guy ! Time 's wasting ! Don 't be so hasty . This concerns the rescue of your friends . Huh ? What did you say ? ! I don 't know what to do ... I can 't even figure out which way is which . Say ... do you think the Minerva is okay ? I 'm sure it 's okay . they can limp into the spaceport . they can come get us in Fighter-2 or something ... 'Cause I 've had the rescue beacon turned on for a while now ! Hmm ... so ... Don 't say stuff like that ! Shhh ! What is it ? Something ... just moved out there . see ? — That 's what 's so strange . — What ? ! All the animals are on the alert for something ... so something must be out there . what ... What is it ? ! I don 't know . — Joe ! — Stay still ! — It 's those guys from before . — What ? ! Looks like they 've traced our rescue signal . That means they are ... over there ! Help ! They 're coming from above ! Watch out ! Damn you ! Die ! Alfin ! I 'm all right . I 'll get you for this ! Over there ! Klutz ! Look who 's talking ! I can see you perfectly ! Gotcha ! Looks like it 's Game Over . And you lose . Both hands up ! Freeze ! What an idiot ! Joe ! Don 't move ! and I 'll blow her brains out ! pal ... her Crusher Jacket won 't save her ! Drop your weapon ! Crushers can be rather tame . Scared ? I thought so . You shouldn 't have made it so difficult for us . before I finish you off . Don 't look ! Damn you ! Joe ! Alfin ! Dammit ! Joe ! Alfin ! Joe ! Talos ! eh ? It 's a nest of monsters in here ! Get us outta here fast ! Roger ! That ship ! The President ? ! you see ... and so he let us borrow this ship . What do you think that means ? We don 't know for sure ... but his secretary was saying that the President wanted to see you . He offered to completely repair the Minerva as well ... and that makes me wonder if something fishy is going on . What 're you gonna do ? We owe them one . So we have to see them . you 're right about that . But ... it does seem a little strange . It 's a nicer place than I thought . Ha ! This planet is just plain tacky ... What do you think you 're doing ? ! I wonder ? What 's the story ? ! Th ... This doesn 't look too good ! There ... 3 down ! where 's our pick-up ? you dimbulb ! The President will be joining us soon . You must be Crusher Joe and his team . I must apologise for having made such a sudden request to meet you . I am the President of Lagol ... Dupro Mardola . I am stunned and speechless . and bear us no ill will . It seems that you have some idea of who attacked us . Who were they ? There is a group of space pirates who are trying to conquer this planet ... while we are still trying hard to build it . I believe they are responsible . They attacked us while we were making our descent . Obviously they were monitoring our every move . Is your Space station 's data network there for the pirates ' convenience ? ! not at all ! But it is true that they have infiltrated virtually everything . of all places . So ? What is it that you want from us ? I believe that there is something that you should know ... about the incident you were involved in . who are based here . Their leader is one of the galaxy 's most notorious pirates ... Big Murphy . His men have brought to this planet the cryogenic suspension system ... and the woman suspended in a coma state . That was the cargo that you were trying to deliver to Miccola . then why haven 't you ... asked the USF to take care of them ? ! but it isn 't that simple . We 're being threatened by the Murphy gang ... they 'll blow up the planet . This ain 't good ! — This way ! This way ! — Where are you going ? ! — There 's a cute guy over here ! — Oh ! Lagol is still a young nation . and our terraforming is incomplete . then the destruction of our planet would be easy for them . Mr. President ... right ? even though you act recklessly at times . Wow ... he 's right about that ! You dummy ! You just shut your mouth and watch the film ! Okay ! You obnoxious idiots ! Bloody Card ! ™ Eat that ! The reason we 've come here is to catch a rat named Yosef Dodge ... not to start a war with Murphy 's gang ! you 'll have to take on the pirates . Joe ! Over there ! Mr. Mardola . Even reckless Crushers such as us won 't pick a fight with a gang of pirates . we can provide you with very useful intelligence ... and furthermore we can equip you with a variety of materials . we need a commitment from you in return ... We cannot give things away ... for free . I thought so . And ... what 's your price ? Bring me the head of Big Murphy . Hmm ... Fine . we won 't be assassins . We 'll capture him and hand him over to you . How 's that ? Very well . the Lagol Government will deny any knowledge of your actions . Ch ... Cheater ! I 'm the President of Lagol ! I have a duty to protect the planet and its citizens ! Fine ! We 'll do what you want us to do . give it to us ... the information ! This is Begonias Island . essentially turning the entire island into a fortress . Their headquarters are in the central crater ... and both Murphy and the man you 're looking for should be there . I get it now ... without asking . The Marine Jets are all in the water . Okay ! How 're you guys doing over there ? — I 'm all set ! — I 'm ready ! okay ? Hunters ... They 've deployed them to guard the island . incredible ! Right on ! Go for it ! All right ! Yeah ! — Yes ! Yes ! Drop Kick ! Drop Kick ! — Yeah ! Right there ! Go ! — There goes one ! Two ! Three ! — Rocky ! Jackal Rocky is in command ! Jackal Rocky ! The Count is 5 ! This can 't be ! I 'm psyched ! This is gonna be cool ! dummy ! Found it ! This must be our current location . and the central block must be the residential district . The information we were given is very accurate . He said that he used spy satellites to gather the data . That Mardola 's pretty sharp ! full of tricks ! All right ! Let 's go ! I found a car in the back ! What are you doing ? ! How much time does it take ? ! You useless bunch of fools ! the operation has succeeded . Her breathing and body temperature are both back to normal . She simply has not regained consciousness ! not just drugs ... Her consciousness just won 't ... er ... come back ... So what difference does it make ? ! Stop whining like a baby ! give us more time ... Time ? ! and patience ! has grown tired of waiting for you ! you won 't live to regret it ! sir ! — What is it ? Cat 's Eye Norma has ... Norma ... What happened to you ? ! K ... Killie ... I can 't believe it ... Nero 's dead ! as you can see ... Nero 's dead ? ! I 'm sorry . I screwed up . I 've ruined the reputation of the Murphy Four . Wh ... Whoever did this to Norma ... I won 't forgive ' em ! Who were they ? C ... Crushers ! so we decided to kill them at the Station . that is . That was your plan ... and this is the result ? Killie ! You shouldn 't talk like that ! Roki ! I 'm sorry ... I 'll take care of this unfinished business ! Don 't do anything on your own ! I 'll go report to the boss . So ... what happened to those Crushers ? Some damned VTOL came and rescued them . A VTOL ? ! Killie ... They must have allies on Lagol ... somebody came to rescue them ! Roki ! and smoke them out ! They or their allies might have snuck onto the island . even if it means using all the Hunters ! sir ! I will be in Murphy 's quarters . Dammit ... Who the hell does he think he is ? ! { } { } { } { } { } { } { } Okay ! we 're going . You ready ? Be very careful . sir . That bothers me . sir ? The fact that they have allies on Lagol ... that bothers me . Perhaps there 's a connection between them and USF Intelligence . You 're naïve . Sir ? There 's another suspect ... a really slimy one . He couldn 't ! A coward like him wouldn 't have the guts to betray us ! Killie . Sir ? but he 's ... There 's been an explosion in Sector 4 ! Intruders may have broken in ! What ? ! Who are they ? ! How many ? ! sir . It happened so suddenly ... — Killie ... — Sir ! Go catch me the mouse ... It 'll be easier if we learn the truth from the traitor 's own mouth . sir ! tell us your condition ... How is the spaceport ? how about you ? What have we got ? but we haven 't been able to capture them yet . ... damage has spread to Sector 5 ! Route 6 has been destroyed ! sir ! You think you 're hot stuff ... you Crusher fools ! Take it easy ! We 're the diversion ! I know . — Ha ! Take that ! — Don 't get cocky ! All right ... it should be around here . — It 's time ! Let 's go ! — Okay ! They 're mine ! Yahoo ! Close it ! Close the gate ! Hurry ! Damn ! to hell with it ! Ricky ! Good Lord ! He 's uglier than I am ! too ! — How do you do ! — Oh ! Hello there ... my young Crusher friends ! but you were fools to underestimate us . noisy commotion ... has got to be some sort of diversionary tactic . What 's so funny ? ! Don 't underestimate us either ... you 're terribly mistaken . Eh ? We 're a diversionary tactic too ! You 've missed our main operation . and put your hands up ! don 't say I didn 't warn you ... Catch ! After ' em ! that was a mistake ... — Where are we going now ? — To the roof ... there 's a heliport there . Damn ... It doesn 't go to the roof ! What 's this ? ! No response yet ! Increase the voltage a bit more ! sir ... Any more will fry her nervous system ... she will never regain consciousness ! Joe ! It 's ... Elena ! Wh ... Who are you people ? ! Quiet ! We 're taking her with us ! Got a problem with that ? Gimme that ... you pervert ! There should be a heliport up on the roof ... where 's its elevator ? ! T ... To the right of this room ... there 's one for the patients ' use ... Take me there ! Hurry up ! stop ! Ow ... Dammit ! What kind of lousy heliport is this ? ! Joe ... over there ! Good ... we 'll take it ! it 's built for just two ! or jump ! There they are ! — Listen up ... hold on tight ! — Yeah ... We 're falling ! I knew we were overloaded ! and don 't let go of Elena ! Don 't let them get away ! Damn ! How could this happen ? ! Where are the VTOLs ? ! they were all scrambled to deal with the earlier incident ... You idiot ! Go after that helicopter ! Catch them no matter what it takes ! Where are Talos and Ricky ? They 're nowhere in sight ... Do you think they got caught ? Maybe so ... don 't worry . They aren 't dead . after all . leaving you behind . I 'm sure . just the four of you . Ha ! The four of us were too much for you weenie pirates ! you ought to be more polite . that 's all . little boy ... — Ha ! You got that right ! — Silence ! or given you information about us . Who was it ? ! Talk ! Ha ! We didn 't need any information ! to take out a crappy hideout that looks like a birdcage ? ! It seems like you 're trying to make a sucker out of me . you albino geek ! Killie ... Wh ... What is it ? Lemme hurt ' em a little ... I 've got just the tool for teaching him some manners . okay ? ! Oh yeah ? my big-mouthed little friend ... Have you changed your mind at all ? — Wait ! — Huh ? Are you finished already ? A wussy massage like that won 't help my aching shoulders ! you moron ! you ! Roki ! Knock it off ! Hey ! Boss ... Help ! I said ! That 's enough ! B ... Big Murphy ! Oh ! I thought that you 'd be up to something like this ... You 're nothing but a bunch of dimwits ! he called me names ... You stupid idiot ! Killing them won 't do us any good ... you idiot ? ! You good-for-nothings never use your heads ! Killie couldn 't catch the other two ! I ... I caught these two ! not you . Boss ! You 're always making me look like a fool ! Enough of this nonsense ... You specious schmuck ! sir ! You 're so disorganised ! When will you be able to manage on your own ? ! Sir ! We 'll continue with this after capturing the other two . Why don 't you pour some water on the big one . sir . I ... Impressive ! then ... just who is she ? Joe ! They 're coming ! — Joe ! — Shhh ! They 're shooting at random ! They 're just guessing that we 're here . Thank goodness ... Huh ? ! you lecher ? ! Where am I ? Oh ! just to save me . I don 't know what to say ... it 's not like that ... so ... that 's all there is to it . My name isn 't Elena ... I 'm Matua Jona ... I was working as Dr. Barbos ' assistant at ... Opus University 's Gravitational Physics Lab . you 're a scientist . why would the pirates want you ? They were interested in the theme of Dr. Barbos ' research . The theme ? Dr. Barbos was trying to perfect ... a new kind of warp system . A new kind of warp system ? ! Yes . It corrected many of the problems of conventional warp systems . and eliminated motion sickness ... It was a revolutionary system . we discovered its horrible potential . — Potential ... — ... for what ? but the system ... allowed for external manipulation of the warp field . — External manipulation ? ! — What ? ! Yes ... It made it possible to control other ships ' warp systems . That 's incredible ! then that entire incident must 've been ... Matua ... The pirates used the system to snatch you from our ship ! What ? ! The pirates ... have the system ? ! Matua ! no ! The system shouldn 't be used at all ! It 's still in the earliest stages of development ... We can 't predict when it will become decoherent . Decoherent ? ! then ... what ? Hunters ! It looks bad ! We 're being surrounded ! Take this ! Alfin ! Are you all right ? I 'm having a bad hair day ! How about you guys ? We 're fine here ! Close your eyes ! It 's all right now . That took care of most of them . I 've drained my energy tube . Me too . And I had to use the photon grenade . There 's gonna be more of them coming though . do you think that we can somehow use the Hunters ' weapons ? Alfin . This ain 't gonna work ! These are totally useless ! They 're full of cheap and crappy parts ! They must have picked them up on the black market . Sheesh ! Joe ... Did you say something ? How old are you ? Huh ? Wh ... Why ask me that now ? I 'm 19 . Why ? You 're so young . Being so young ... why would you be in a dangerous line of work ... such as that of the Crushers ? Huh ? I 'm doing it because I 'm young ! like son . He pioneered dangerous crushing when he was very young . Even I know of Crusher Dan . He 's a very famous person . I see ... He 's your father . It 's irrelevant ... I 'm not a little kid anymore ... and Dad 's changed totally . — Changed ? — Yeah . He 's become one of those important persons ... He doesn 't understand how people like us feel . — That 's not true ... — Yes it is . and I 'm sure that he 's concerned about you ... It is so ! You 're wrong ! Dad 's a different person now . Joe ... and finish telling me what you were gonna tell me before . what would you do next ? It 's not a hypothetical question . The pirates already have it . And they realised that they needed me to perfect the system . you can ... control the system ? I can control the system ... as well as ... As well as ? ... make sure it never works again . — Joe ! — Oh ! and you 're here messin ' around ! You piss me off ! You pervert ... you womaniser ... you ... will ya ? This was really important ! I said ! I hear something ! Joe ? ! I don 't think that we can fight right now . Shall we call the Minerva ? It could get here in a few minutes . we 'll do that later . let 's go with Plan C. Plan C ? and wait for our chance . then ... Our mission isn 't complete yet ! and besides ... And besides ? ... we can 't leave them in possession of the warp system . Matua ? Yes . Argh ! Why does it always have to be like this ? ! Damn ! I don 't like this ... didn 't you ! I 'll take very good care of you later ! Please be patient ! They 're so rude ! Don 't they know how to treat a lady ? ! The fate of the beautiful shall be to end in torment ! I 'm so unblessed ! — Joe ! — Boss ! eh ? we assumed that you 'd rescue us ! This is so embarrassing ! What 're you talking about ? ! Just look at the mess you 're in ! what can I say . eh ? Not at all ! It 's a-okay ! Talos ... What ? ! if that 's the case ... then ... We don 't have much time . Shall I use our last resort ? I 'd say so . Let 's see now ... Stand back ... Looks good ! let 's get out of here fast ! wait up ! Don 't leave me behind ! that 's right ... there was a little pest in here with us ... I kinda like you like this . you nincompoop ! You big idiot ! You rat ! Here ! Come on ! Thanks ! will ya ... my man ! What was that about a pest ? Enough nonsense ! You 'll be really sorry if you continue giving us a hard time . This is your last chance . What 's your answer ? Is that your answer ? ! Norma ... Miss ? Stop ... Please stop ... I 'll do anything you say ... Please stop ... Such honesty ! This was the solution to the problem ... No wonder those damned doctors weren 't able to do anything . will you not ? Take me to it . Excellent . We 'll put you to work immediately . Emergency ! The Crushers have escaped ! — What ? ! — They got away ? ! I see ... he literally had something up his sleeve ! We must not underestimate them again . this will be great entertainment . Broadcast it throughout the entire base . sir . Let us hope that they give us a fine performance ! This way ! This doesn 't look good . I 'll go first ... Cover me ! S ... Sure ! Joe ! Joe ! Dammit ! Take this ! Open the emergency hatch ! We 'll finish him off inside ! He 's stumbled into a very interesting place ! we have got to see ! This smell ... I knew it ! You idiot ! What kinda dimwit would use a laser in an explosive atmosphere ? ! A-ha ! I didn 't know this was such a handy item ! Take this ! didn 't you ! here comes the climax ! my boy ! that 's hardly fair ! Do us a favour ... and dissolve ! you stubborn brat ! just let go ! you can rest in peace ! Come on ! Bitch ! L ... Let go ! N ... Norma ! H ... How could he ? ! sir ! he won 't be pleased . - -- ehm ... just who is Big Shaw ? } Don 't let him get out of the underground passage ... Eliminate him at all costs ! Is that clear ? Valenstinos ! Joe ! Are you guys all right ? Er ... You stink ! We fell into the sewer . That 's what saved us ! so we shouldn 't go any further . Let 's call the Minerva . It 's time to play the game our way ! Let 's return a few of their favours ! There it is ! Ha ha ! It 's been so long that I thought they were dead . let me see ... Eeek ! What next ? sir ! — They 're approaching fast ! — What ? ! They 're here ! Hey ! Not bad ! Where 's our Air Defences ? ! Shoot them down ! — Looks like we 're saved . — Yahoo ! This is awful ... — This is just too much ! — Very strange ... The Minerva 's missiles shouldn 't have caused this much damage . — The generators have been destroyed ! — Transmission lines are all out ! Sir ? — Gomora . What ? ! Bring the girl ! sir ! break right ! Got it ! — Are you okay ? — Yeah ... Ha ! There you are ! You son of a bitch ! You wanna get beat up again ? ! Well ... why don 't we see what happens ! C 'mon ! with interest ! on me ! damn ... I guess I got a little carried away there ! W ... Wait for me ! I 'm coming too ! Look at your face ! You 're such a loser ! dammit ! Talk about bad timing ! look ! It 's a shuttle ! Dammit ! Joe ! Murphy is getting away in that shuttle ! Matua is with him ! Damn ! Isn 't the Minerva here yet ? ! Here she comes ! Idiots ! It can 't get any worse than this ! How could they let Murphy get away ? ! Just when things were going so well ... This wouldn 't have happened if they 'd just killed him right away ! I just know it ! If he does get there ... it 'll be all over for us ! The Minerva has also taken off . I believe that Joe 's team is going after Murphy ... I 've had it ... with those good-for-nothings ! Request the assistance of the United Space Force ! What ? ! They 're always roaming around this stellar region . Call them at once ! sir ... what about the ... It doesn 't matter now ! Our top priority is destroying Murphy ! as long as we can destroy Murphy ! eh ? ! What an ugly piece of junk ! Colonel ! Sorry to keep you waiting ! I 'm tired of waiting ! Just when will I get to kick some ass ? ! Don 't be so grouchy . Things will soon get quite interesting . Oh ? That 's not just more bullshit ? — Colonel ! — What is it ? We 've received an emergency communication ... it is a special request from the President of Lagol . and we are engaged in combat ... " We request your aid at once ... the orbital station Gomora . End of message . I get to kick some ass for real ! See ? What did I tell you ? I 'm going . See ya later . you 'll be sorry ! We 're leaving at once ! we don 't deserve to be in the USF ! The shuttle is heading towards Station No. 6 ... unknown . Joe ! They 're following us ... About 40 of them ! eh ? Shall we prepare to engage them ? The shuttle comes first . I 've lost radar lock on the shuttle ! They 've made it inside . huh ? That 's not just a space station ... It 's a space fortress ! Murphy ! Murphy ! Murphy ! Murphy ! Murphy ! Murphy ! Tighten the security at the docking port . I 'll be in the control room . sir ! this is Murphy 's ace in the hole . Payback time ! No good ! They 're too big for us ! Let 's go for the docking port ... One concentrated attack ! Fire ! Ha ! What a bunch of stuck weaklings ! hurry up and initialise the system . but controllability is another matter . you of all people know what I 'm talking about . the only one who knows the system inside and out . won 't you ? It 's not working ! It 's heavily reinforced ! Joe ! They 're coming after us ! Looks like we 're in for it now ! Those are all battleship class ships ! Wow ! Joe ? There 's no turning back now ! Assume combat formation ! Prepare to engage ! We 'll show them the difference between Pirates and Crushers ! Ignition ! Eat this ! Alright ! Where are we hit ? Topside ! You 'll pay for that ! They took out our port engine ! Jettison it ! We 're just asking them to kill us by inches ! Don 't give up so quickly ! Scum ! Huh ? ! no ! What happened ? ! Howdy ! I dropped by to help out ! Bard ! Buttinski ! Sorry about that . Doctor Matua ? Just as I suspected ... the Controller is burnt out . and then rebuilt ... the consequences will be disastrous ! Can you fix it ? Wh ... Yes ... I 'll see what I can do . Very well ! That 's what I call technical support ! Sir ... The orbit-to-ground missiles are ready for launch . Good . Fire them at once ... The first target shall be Pablopolis ! Send them right into Mardola 's office ! B ... Boss ! W ... We can 't do that ! What was that ? Do you have a problem with my orders ? that Joe-somebody 's Crusher gang blew up the base ... Mardola had nothing to do with it ... You idiot ! Did you think that those stupid Crushers were able to do that unaided ? ! so just shut up and keep quiet ! sir ! Ha ! Traitors ! What ? ! The United Space Force ! Fire ! Don 't let a single ship escape ! Fire ! The Space Force ? ! unless Mardola requested it ... I see ! It 's him ! That fool ... spared no effort to defeat me ! Out of my way ! If it 's come to this ... No ! You mustn 't use it ! Hold the girl ! Stop before something awful happens ! Spacetime itself will implode ! but it 's still invincible ! Observe ... Mardola ... This is what happens when someone bothers me ! What the ? ! Sir ... It 's the system ... Murphy is using the system ! What 's going on ? ! our ships are vanishing ! What ? ! That 's absolutely impossible ! Don 't talk nonsense ! Goddammit ! Please ! Please stop ! Silence ! Now I 'll show no mercy ... I 'll annihilate them all ! Mardola ... this will be the end of Lagol ! Boss ! Huh ? why you ... you 're always putting me down ! All that ends now ! Mardola told me ... that I 'm the one who ought to be the boss ! I 'm the boss from now on ! You 're gonna die right here ! You idiot ! Mardola has deceived you ! From now on ... it 'll be the Roki Pirates ! I won 't let you get away with this ! Don 't move ! spacetime will crumble ! It won 't stop ! It won 't stop ! Joe ! The gravitational wave meter has gone berserk ! Look ! Look at Norn ... Minaus ' primary ! It 's all because of that system ! Oh ? It 's moving ! The spacetime distortion is swallowing Norn ! A spacetime implosion ... Is it for real ? ! Sir ! It 's too dangerous here ! We 've got to leave now ! It 's over ... It 's all over ! Kowalsky ! We 've got an emergency situation here ! Lend us a hand ! Oh ! It 's you ! don 't you think ? Looks like we 're bound together by a terrible destiny ! We can chitchat later ! We 're gonna enter Gomora ... Use your blasters to blow open their docking port for us ! please ! I don 't have a clue what 's going on ... but ... Okay ! Yaw + 90 degrees ! Aim the blasters at the docking port ! we won 't be able break down their shields ! elevate plus 3 ! Fire ! All right ! Good ! We 're going in ! Colonel ! Let 's roll ! We 're not too far off ... It 's just ahead of us ! Roger ! What the ? ! How can I stop the system now ? that 's it . The power generator ! S ... Stop ! Where do you think you 're going ? ! I said ! I 'm telling ya ! Goddammit ! or I 'll shoot you down ! Now 's our chance ! You lousy bastard ! Let 's go ! Matua is in there ! What do you think you 're doing ? ! Stop ! That belongs to me ! Keep your mitts off ! Stop ! S ... Stop ! It 's mine ! Stay away ! Dammit ! Matua ! Joe ... Matua ! will you help me ? Th ... That lever ... please ... pull it all the way down ! Got it ... right ? Yes ... Hurry ! It stopped ... Matua ! Thank you ... Joe ... Matua ! You can 't die ! Open your eyes ! Matua ! Looks like a disaster and a calamity waltzed through here ! Where 's Boss Murphy ? Why don 't you look around . down for the count . Very well done . Guess I was wrong about you guys ... You Crushers are a little better than I thought . We don 't need any commendations from you ! thank Mardola ! M ... Mardola ? ! I ... I get it now ... Th ... That bastard Mardola ... had me fooled ! punk ? ! Talk about a big laugh ... That scum Mardola not only fooled Murphy ... but me as well ! I 'm such a total moron ... That scumbag ! As chief representative of the nation ... please allow me to make this delightful announcement . With the help of these dedicated Crushers ... we were able to completely eliminate the illegal activities and violence ... who have long been a stain upon our nation 's honour ! Today is a new beginning for a new Lagol ... Our pursuit of justice and prosperity ... a brand new day ! Sir ... The press conference was a major coup ! Uh-huh . How are the arrangements for tonight 's event ? they are all set just wonderfully ! all of a sudden ? The party doesn 't start for quite a while . There 's something I have to tell you . Something ? Got a message for you from Roki and Murphy ... They said they 'll be waiting for you in hell . Just what are talking about ? Jokes like that ... Don 't play dumb ! like piracy ... would help you maintain your popular support . the conspiracy was much deeper than that . You were a part of the Murphy Pirates from the beginning ! you agreed to turn a blind eye on the pirates ' hideouts ... in exchange for a piece of action ! you weren 't satisfied with your share . The fact that executive control was in Big Murphy 's hands got in your way . Furthermore ... you wanted the warp system ! you could 've obtained enormous riches without using the pirates . so you used us and Roki to eliminate Murphy ! but do you have proof ? Proof that will substantiate such an outrageous theory ? ! I thought you 'd ask ... The proof ? Here it is ! Wh ... What do you think you 're doing ? ! There 's no need for violence ! He 's an outlaw ! A terrorist ! Get the police ! sir ! old man ! Mr. President ... how do you do ? Intelligence Unit 2 . Intelligence Unit 2 ? ! I am able to be here and present to you ... sir . I hereby arrest you for conspiracy to commit piracy ! Joe ... everything turned out well . I really appreciate your assistance . Joe ! I wonder if he still likes me ? I 'll ask him for ya . Lt. Col. Bard . sir ! I 'd hoped that you 'd feel a little sympathy for my suffering ! Did he do well ? he gave me a nice little punch right here ! really ? for pretending ignorance while letting the Intelligence Unit use your son . Oh ! N ... Never mind ! brother ! I asked them if they wanted to come along ... Ricky and Talos would rather be on the Minerva ! Joe ... want me to guess who you were thinking of just then ? Sorry . I didn 't mean it that way . You know ... I heard that ... Dr. Barbos was actually Matua 's father . That must be why he had to do what he did ... he put her in cryogenic suspension ... in the hopes of preventing her from being forced to work for the pirates . and I 'm sure that he 's concerned about you ... Joe ! Right ! Birds take flight ... out to the horizon ... Space is unfolded by the clashing of waves . We wanderers roam around ... in the river of eternity ... 'til the day the fire dies inside our hearts . our trip will never end . deep space . So let us fly to the end of time ... { \ cH68FDFF } So let 's see eternal grace . with all our friends . { \ cH68FDFF } The trip with all my friends – the human race . The flame flickers ... at the edge of darkness ... a new day is born . We seek dreams ... that never end ... 'til the day we lose our voice of passion . our trip will never end . deep space .

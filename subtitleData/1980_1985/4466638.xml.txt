 [ wind howling ] NARRATOR : My life fades the vision dims . All that remains are memories . I remember a time of chaos ruined dreams , this wasted land . But most of all , I remember the Road Warrior the man we called Max . To understand who he was , you have to go back to another time when the world was powered by the black fuel and the deserts sprouted great cities of pipe and steel . Gone now , swept away . For reasons long forgotten , two mighty warrior tribes went to war and touched off a blaze which engulfed them all . Without fuel they were nothing . They 'd built a house of straw . The thundering machines sputtered and stopped . Their leaders talked and talked and talked . But nothing could stem the avalanche . Their world crumbled the cities exploded . A whirlwind of looting a firestorm of fear . Men began to feed on men . On the roads , it was a white-line nightmare . Only those mobile enough to scavenge brutal enough to pillage , would survive . The gangs took over the highways ready to wage war for a tank of juice . And in this maelstrom of decay ordinary men were battered and smashed . Men like Max . The warrior Max . In the roar of an engine , he lost everything and became a shell of a man . A burnt-out , desolate man . A man haunted by the demons of his past . A man who wandered out into the wasteland . And it was here in this blighted place that he learned to live again .

[ BOTH screaming ] [ wind howling ] [ engine CLATTERlNG ] NARRATOR : And so began the journey north to safety to our place in the sun . Among us we found a new leader , the man who came from the sky the Gyro Captain . And just as Pappagallo had planned we traveled far beyond the reach of men on machines . The juice , the precious juice , was hidden in the vehicles . As for me , I grew to manhood in the fullness of time , I became the leader the chief of the Great Northern Tribe . And the Road Warrior ? That was the last we ever saw of him . He lives now only in my memories .

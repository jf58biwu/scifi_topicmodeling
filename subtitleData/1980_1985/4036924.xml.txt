 HEARTY GREETINGS FROM THE GLOBE - Why are you yelling ? - Me ? But ... Darling ! - Did you throw a bottle from the window ? ! - No , Mr. Vanyerka . - I wish ! Stay covered , miss . For now . One , two . Rascals ! Is it possible to get any privacy here ? ! - Don 't be cross with me , I don 't know , what ... Mr. Vanyerka ? What happened , Mr. Vanyerka ? Mr. Vanyerka ? Oh , a bump ! Come round , Mr. Vanyerka . Well , wake up ! Yirinka , Wait ! Yirinka ! Now look . Was that necessary ? Mr. Vanyerka ? Where have they sent us ? We 're here . - They are people . - Beautiful . It 's a nice sunny day , once again , good morning . We will open a window and take a deep breath . For the floor , actually for your arms , now calls another exercise , only for ambitious athletes , because these will be press-ups . So , a nice , straight push-up on your arms , legs backwards , we start by bending the arms down , but we are not laying on the belly doing this , we are stretching our arms nicely making a push-up And here we go . We loosen our arms And up and down and up and ... Sir . Excuse me . Import , export . Let 's go . Mr. Vanyerka ? - Doctor Yansky ? - Yes . What would you like ? You 're not going to invite us in ? Of course . Please . You were chosen by the biggest computer in the galaxy to be the representative of the planet . Congratulations . We came to accumulate objective systematical information . About the conditions on Earth . This is a confidential mission . You understand ? Calm down , please . Part of our project is to be inconspicuous . But if you really arrived from outer space , you would look completely different . Like what ? For example like green elves or something like that . We don 't like doing this . Every change of appearance exhausts us . Doesn 't it ? Then we must rest for a long time . Now do you believe us ? Excuse me , but why me ? Why only me ? How can I be beneficial to you ? There are other influential people , why don 't you go to them ? For example ... - For example ... - No need . Look , doctor , you are a completely ordinary , insignificant man . - Congratulations . - You don 't lie . And this is exactly what we need . We need a background , a guide , who will help us understand matters on Earth . I must go to work . Pardon . What is " work " ? Work ... Work is the meaning of life . And what is the meaning of life ? Meaning ... I will explain it to you when I get back from work . - You mustn 't snap . - And what is " snap " ? Such big gaps in knowledge ... Snap , is like ... It is like ... I have it ! It was those from the eighth floor . When I catch them , I will really catch them ! INSTITUTION FOR RELATIONS WITH EXTRATERRESTRIAL CIVILIZATIONS . Hey ... Doctor ! ARTIFICIAL FOOD RESEARCH Good morning , Jerry . Some things in people 's homes ring continuously . And some don 't . But also continuously . Martin ? - I 'd like to say something . - Yes . If it goes on like this , it will come to an end . - Yes . - I mean yesterday . Yes . Why did you let that idiot be with you ? We could have had a nice evening . - Yes . - Who are you constantly calling ? - Are you even listening to me ? - No . I mean yes . You get this from the pills . Trying it on yourself ! What do you have your guinea-pigs for ? Some things in human homes are breakable . And some are unbreakable . What do people use it for ? I don 't know , people are strange . And hang up when I 'm speaking with you ! No , I can 't stand it . When will this misery end ? ! Some things can open normally . And some can 't open at all . But they can . We must close the opening so that something else won 't fly away . - Some things play . - And some things don 't play . - Did you turn a knob ? - Yes . All . It doesn 't play . It 's only hissing . Of course it doesn 't play . There aren 't any parts there . And now we welcome in the studio professor Janatka , to introduce the popular series " Mystical outer space " . Dear audience , recently there have been many groundless reports about the existence of extra-terrestrial civilizations on our planet . From a scientifical point of view this is shear nonsense because ... Hey , doctor ! - Thank you . - You 're welcome . - That was a great explosion , Doctor . - You gave us a real treat . Congratulations ! At night some people are falling into a strange kind of unconsciousness . - Shall we try it too ? - Well , since we are here ... - Are you already unconscious ? - Not yet . Mum , mummy , Not noodles ! Please not noodles ! Let 's repeat after him . Mum , mummy , Not noodles ! Please not noodles ! Mum , mummy , Please not noodles ! Not noodles . Not noodles . Not noodles . Not noodles . Noodles ... no . - Not noodles . Why me ? Why only me ? Why only me ? Why only ... What is it ? - A soft-boiled egg . - It has a great shape . A civilization that can produce such a perfect thing , - is a very advanced civilization . - This is not produced , - hens lay these . - Hens ? - Yes . Tell them we congratulate them . Excuse me , but according to the program we have an opinion poll . Do you want help ? You 're not going to eat ? No , don 't worry . We have our own methods . Good afternoon . How would you react to a visit from extraterrestrial civilizations ? I would kick them in the arse ! Look , I 'm not intrerested in politics . At work I 'm doing my job , I adorn windows . I want my own peace . Good afternoon.How would you react to a visit from an extraterrestrial civilization ? Pidlivization ? How would you react to a visit from an extraterrestrial pidlivization ? Civilization . It depends on where they came from . Good afternoon . Can we ask you a question ? How would you react to a visit from extraterrestrial civilizations ? We must have made a mistake somewhere . Look , just between us , - what do you think of them ? - So I should give my opinion ? No , don 't worry . I 'm telling you " just between us " . I 'm supposed to give my opinion between us ? - I will not give it . - And why not ? I will give my opinion , and you will broadcast it , and who will have problems ? Me . Do I want problems ? No . If you want problems then give your opinion . What , me ? ! I 'm only an ordinary substrate . Excuse me , how would you react to a visit from an extraterrestrial civilization ? Now I don 't know what I would say . I 'm thinking about something else , I don 't perceive you . Well , I don 't know . Everyone whould be wondering and would be curious how it would work out . For sure they would be wondering too . It 's an interesting question , but I don 't know . That question has been put strangely . Depending on whether they have the antennae or they speak with a dictaphone . - Do they seem normal to you ? - Normal ? - Definitely not . - Really ? - Normal ? No . I would probably be a bit taken aback from it . I would probably go crazy if they were here . I haven 't the time to respond to anything , I 'm going to a meeting . That sublime expression ... It 's possible to see it when they are thinking . When I 'm thinking , you can 't see anything on me . Nothing at all . Really . But you are forgetting that we don 't need to think . So we can continue . - Can I ask you a question ? - Certainly . How would you react to a visit from an extraterrestrial civilization ? How would I react ... Calmly , the same as to any other visit . How fluid their walking is . Just look . We are not walking we are shambling . Yes , we are shambling . Calm down . They 'll also be shambling . How would you react to a visit from an extraterrestrial civilization ? I 'm already too old for this . How would you react to a visit from an extraterrestrial civilization ? Hard to say . Thank you . You 're from television , aren 't you ? They have questions like this . I don 't know how I would react , you know . Please don 't put this on television . So that I don 't blurt something . I would probably try to suggest that I 'm peaceful . Good afternoon . Can we ask you one ... - One ? - I think we 've already been here . Only one ? ! Release me ! We come in peace ! From the galaxy ! - I 'll give you galaxy ! - Release me ! - No ! You 'll break my arm ! - You won 't make fun of me ! - Rascals ! - Let me go ! - I 'll break the door down with you ! - Let me go ! I 'm not here for anyone 's fun ! I 've just finished a night shift ! - And they call themselves intelligent creatures ! - Calm down . I 'll tell you who they are . - Aggressive louts . - Calm down . I won 't stay here a minute longer . - We are flying back . - And what about our mission ? - What will we tell home ? - The truth . They 'll send someone more skilful here and we won 't go anywhere else anymore . Don 't be crazy . Why didn 't you keep the finished answers ? - Our methods are good for nothing . - So we must use their methods . It seems that if someone gives you one blow , - you have to strike back . - You think ? - What are you doing ? - Strike back . - At once ? - You mustn 't hesitate ! If you think ... - How was it ? - Fine ! Well , that 's it ! Hurray , we have it ! - They haven 't worked this out badly . Pick it up , the galaxy is waiting for our report . One moment , we 'll just settle something here . So you see , an agreement is always possible . Hush ! The planet is called Earth . It 's inhabited by living creatures . Multi-legged , four-legged ... and two-legged . The two-legged creature is called a human . He considers himself to be the highest form of life . He has gained control of energy ... and invented a line of useful things . The lighter , The telephone , The toaster . - Soft-boiled eggs , the food dispenser . An automatic machine for amusement . Pop music . Guided missiles . Stress . - Tranquillizers , stimulants . - Myocardial infarction , reduction diet . Jogging . The escalator . And public transport . Together all these things are called " technical civilization " . Technical civilization serves people so that they are happy and satisfied . Technical civilization functions by using buttons . Connection started . Pop into the supermarket at least for mineral water . Hey gentlemen , a trolley ! Act inconspicuously . Observe . Watch how people are doing it . - Push , push ! - Don 't act crazy . - The bigger is carrying the smaller . - I told you , inconspicuously ! - What a lot of things . - All of these can produce people . It 's fantastic . We must take samples . We should have started here and not with the inquiry . " They spare your time " . Do you know what fascinates me the most about people ? How they live . Packaged time . Magnificence . Hey , look ! - Galaxy . - What have they written about us ? " Aromatic , coloured , Trnava . " Take ten . Stadium of developed miniaturization . Now we must choose what we want . Well we won 't take this . And what about this ? We 'll take this . - Give me one too . - Open your own . Horror ! Don 't let these two out , they don 't have any ID . - I 'll call the police . - Don 't do it ! Hold on please , I will explain ! Beat it ! Doctor , what about the mineral water ? They are not from here . They 're from a different galaxy . I mean from the agricultural co-operative Galaxy . Such a small village . Never in their life have they seen a big supermarket . Manager , I will pay for it all . - Why me ? I 'm not responsible for it ! - What have you got ? - Me ? Nothing . - Give it here ! - But I really don 't have anything ! - Quick , what is it ? - A little memento . We fly from such a great distance , with a noble mission . and you steal in a supermarket . That makes 3625 crowns and 50 hellers . - Thank you . - All right . Hello . What does this mean ? We can 't figure out the process in which this works . - Can you give us some advice ? - What is in the can ? Great . But we can 't see in there . Do you have matches , doctor ? No ! Jeez , it 's petrol ! Where did you get it ? This must go immediately ! - What if someone saw you ? - It was lying in front of the house . Unattended . The man who owns this , saved a long time for it . - Worked . Went without food . - Really ? Someone stole my car ! Someone stole my car ! Someone stole my car ! Someone stole my car ! Someone stole my car ! I 've been saving all my life ! I 've been working all my life ! I went without food all my life ! Fuck it ! Someone stole my car ! Someone stole my car ! Someone stole my car ! Go and look ! You can be a witness ! Give it back immediately ! Mr. Vanyerka ? Mr. Vanyerka ! It was here ! It was here ! Here it is ! Here it is , here it is ! Here it is , here it is . Good work , comrades . I 'm glad you came . They stole my car just now . I am Vanyerka Joseph , trustee . Born ... I was born ... Good , isn 't it ? We did what we could ! The planet is actually controlled by a creature , which moves on four legs . It 's called a car . It is the most numerous creature on the planet . A car is used for moving from place to place . The meaning of this moving is unknown . A car is noisy , comfortable ... and gives off an intensive stench . Despite this , people live in perfect harmony with this creature . They remove various obstacles from it 's path ... and build for it huge structures which are called highways . People hold cars in high esteem . They show certain signs of concern when they lose them . Martin ! - Martin ! - I love you ! One moment , the boss has a meeting . I 'm asking for sick leave . Immediately . Now before the symposium ? You 've gone crazy ! And what about the report ? Do you have the report for me ? - Well ... - Yes , or no ? - No ? - I 'm sorry . It 'll be all right . Sorry . - Yansky ! - Good bye ! Martin , what 's going on ? You won 't even look at me ? You have a nice hat . Yes , yes , Doctor Yansky . Decent , truthful , responsible , So send him to a psychiatrist . Life is beautiful . - I know . - So what 's missing in your life ? It 's not missing . It 's excessive . I have aliens at home . So relax nicely , don 't think about anything . Life is beautiful . You don 't understand ! - I can 't go any further . - I know . - Life is beautiful , isn 't it ? - But I really have two aliens at home . - A visit from another planet . - Well , great ! So you will rest at our place , and when you get out of here , you 'll be as fit as a fiddle , won 't you ? - Doctor ? - Yes ? - We are full . We are full . So you won 't rest at our place . But you 'll go and rest in nature , and you 'll be as fit as a squirell . Sister , write down . Nature is the best doctor . Doctor , haven 't you had enough of us yet ? No ? - Don 't you feel tired ? - Let me see . You look bad . Is there something wrong with you ? No , I 'm only a bit overworked . Cursed , fucking job ! Where are you screwing around ? ! - What 's the matter , boss ? - Watch your language ! Fuck watching my language ! You watch your job ! I don 't understand him . What 's this man talking about ? Come on , boys , don 't be crazy . Because of you all the gang is at a stand-still . - Boys , come on . - No boys . Look . - Reproduction artists . - We are starting a new life , boss . - Here is the agreement , master . - " Group Biceps " . - We are going down the artistic road . - Therefore ... we can fuck this job . Cursed , fucking job ! Excuse me , do you have some cursed , fucking job for us ? And now we will play for our Rose from the canteen . This is a magnificent feeling ! Splendid . Indeed . How does it work ? What 's wrong with you ? Well , what 's up ? Nothing . I 'm working . Well , you 're working , but this isn 't working . You 're right . And does yours work ? I can 't see a button anywhere . Maybe it 's centrally controlled somehow . A kind of central control . Hallo ! Hallo ! Hallo ! It 's trash . Oh look ! It 's working . Look , isn 't it manually propelled ? Mine also works . Perfectly ! Try it with this . - It 's splendid ! - It 's something . It 's really something . You have two days off , go to the forest and pull yourself together . Yes , nature is beautiful . Sometimes I jack it in and go to a forest somewhere , to nature 's bosom . A forest , what can be more beautiful ? The clearing , stumps ... deer , foxes , otters , seals , giraffes ... Walruses ... Ah ... I can 't remember the last time I was there . A propos of the report , do you have it for me ? No , I ... Quiet . Be quiet . Be quiet . We 're only human . Accompany the doctor , please . Comrade director , a delegation is waiting for you . Are the scissors prepared ? It 's beautiful ! Isn 't it beautiful , when all the houses are the same ? There 's such an order in it . - Harmony , architecture . When I report this at home ... And I would like to repeat once more in this solemn moment , as a poet says : " O , thanks , thanks to your effort . " Because miniaturization and electronics ... are the future of mankind . Do you know what I like the most about people ? That they can always celebrate something . All right , I 'm coming . - They 're always pestering . - Hurry , these are ours . Inhabitants of Earth live in houses . In small , bigger and the biggest . Many houses together are called a town . A town provides comfort for people . People start the day with a row of typical actions . When they have done the prescribed number of actions , they leave their houses and rush away . They attend to useful activities , which they call work . On Earth work is the meaning of life . People get money for work . People buy things with money , which increases their comfort . After work people return to their homes . By pressing a button they set in motion a device for amusement . Amusement serves people by drawing in new energy , so they can successfully repeat another cycle of daily activities . - Oh no . - Oh yes . You put more effort in your work . As we say , toil . Not so . You put into it more intelligence , as we say , craft . Well , all right . It 's beautiful ! Splendid . - It 's warming . - I 'm just going to the bathroom . We are the first from our galaxy , to enjoy this feeling . An uplifting feeling . I now pronounce you husband and wife . You may kiss the bride . Nature will do you good . I will arrive after you ... Don 't lose your temper . You know it 's bad . You 'll take a rest , everything will be like before . My little bunny will go to a nice forest , snuggle down , yes , snuggle down ... Tell me , why don 't you follow the program ? Who 's the lady , Doctor ? What have you done now ? Yirinka , please ! These are only friends . Yirinka ! Never get married doctor . It 's terrible ! Yirinka ... Enough ! Guys , I surrender ! I 'm a goner . Look at me . I don 't sleep . I wanted to sleep with the lady ! That is , get married ! And getting married , doctor , does it relate somehow to reproduction ? Go away . Go away ! Go away . Doctor , we are terribly sorry , but we aren 't doing it out of spite . We don 't have it easy either . Such research is so terribly demanding . We are trained specialists . I spent my youth on a simulator . With my head downwards . I didn 't have a childhood at all . Do you know what it means to toil through cold eternal space from planet to planet whole light years with such a half-wit ? You should take a rest . Do you also rest sometimes ? - Only in critical situations . - And how ? Shall we show it to the doctor ? Well , actually it 's a secret . But we can show it to you . Ten , nine , eight , seven ... - Six . - ... six , five , four , three , two , One , now ! So how did you like it , doc ... RESERVATION In the last episode of our serial Mystical Outer Space we explained some groundless theories about the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations and their alleged envoys on Earth . Today ... - There he is ! - Fasten your seat belt and no smoking . How many times do I have to remind you ? Doctor ! Doctor ? - Are you here ? Hallo ! - Hallo ! - Hallo ! - Hallo ! He 's not here . I hope nothing will happen to him . - It doesn 't look safe here . - Well , it 's quiet instead . If I 'm not wrong , it 's such a sharp , frosty silence . I would say even a dry silence . Personally I 'm more suited to the silence on Jupiter . The silence there was so fizzy . - I 'm not wrong , am I ? - Yeah . On Jupiter it was fizzy , but sometimes deep and sublime . While on Ganimed the silence was kind of dark blue , lazy , blending together . - Am I right ? Do you remember ? - Of course . Only I don 't remember what the silence blended together with . With a morning cock-crow . But on Oberon the silence there was something wicked . - The nicest silence is on our planet . - That 's right . Such a silence I haven 't heard anywhere else yet . The evenings in front of the bunker ... It 's such a silence . Hallo , Doctor ! Quiet ! You are in a reserved area . I am a crystal clear well , please drink . I am a crystal clear well , please drink . I am a crystal clear well , please drink . I am ... I am a crystal clear well , please dri ... I am a crystal clear well ... - That 's beauty , isn 't it ? - Yes , but we would ... Mother Nature will outlive us all . - It 's beautiful . - But we are looking for ... Yes , yes , a rest . We have wonderful things here . Yes , but we are looking for ... It 's something , isn 't it ? Wow , it 's like at our home . According to the dynamic plan of the landscape development , there should be a hundred years of untouched nature here later . - Let 's continue . - Yes , but ... - Who are you actually looking for ? - A colleague . He got lost , We 're worried about him . In our forest nobody can get lost . Oh , yeah , in the past horrible things happened here . Rabbits ate grass , foxes ate rabbits and bears ate whatever crossed their mind . But now thank God there is order here . Look . I know a crystal clear well , where the forest is the deepest . Dark bracken grows there and in the surroundings , red heather . Thank you for your visit , sirs . We are closing . Please , wait . We 've lost our friend here . But no one can get lost here , sirs . - It belongs to the ministry of culture . - But it 's a scientist . - And what 's his name ? - Doctor Yansky . Hallo . This is attendant Zero . Doctor Yansky come to the exit of the reservation . I repeat . This is attendant zero , barrier 173 . Doctor Yansky come to the exit of the reservation . You caused this . What a mission ! - You are an interplanetary bungler . - Let it go . Look , everybody drives , but we are going on foot . This way we will never look like people . - And would you like it ? - Well ... they are better , prettier . Look at me . Never in my life have I looked better . In contrast to it , out there at home , how do we look ? It 's better not to speak about it ! The ridiculous antennae . Horror ! I 'm telling you , I 'm considering whether or not to stay like this . All right . Normally we look hideous . That 's a fact . On the other hand we can travel where we want . Yoohoo ! Come for a ride ! All over space . And that 's a fact too . Well guys ? Are we going ? FREE HOUSEHOLD Look , where are you going ? - There , where you 're going . - What about having a picnic ? I 'm not interested in it , doctor or no doctor , nature is not anarchy ! - But I ... - From eight until four and that 's it ! What do we have here ? Come . Come . - Show me what you 've got here ? - Wait , stop it . - This is lovely . - Don 't touch it ! It 's mine . Wait , come on ... - It 's beautiful ... - I will take ... No , please ! No ... Help ! Help ! Hel ... Come ... Come ... Saw , saw ... - You 're also going to a meeting ? - Also . Inter-ministry ? No . Inter-planetary . So take him , Stanin . Look , tell me , do you love me ? Look , do you hear ? Will you write to me ? Tell me , do you love me ? Will you write to me ? Manya ? Let 's beat it ! Look ... We 're just naturally loose ! We can 't broadcast this to our planet , nobody would believe it . And why not ? Because if they get to know this on our planet , then everyone will want to fly here . And we don 't have enough flying saucers for this . It would be the end of our civilization . You get it ? Hallo . Hallo ! What do you think ? Should I write to her ? Don 't pick it up ! What will you report to them ? This just isn 't possible . I 'll adjust the message a bit so it won 't be so shocking . What do you think about this ? - No . It 's concealing facts . - I know . But it will be better this way . Believe me . I 'll only a little bit more ... Well you broadcast this alone . Did you go crazy for her or what ? No . I only wanted ... Sorry . - Well not this at all . - And why not ? On Earth there are people of different genders , that attract each other , and they call it love . Why don 't you want to broadcast it ? Because they wouldn 't understand it . Love ... And why do you care ? We must deliver all available information . This information is available , but incommunicable . - What do you suggest ? - I wouldn 't like it if we caused panic on our planet . I 'll alter it a bit . - What about this ? - Let me see . " On Earth there are people of different genders , that attract each other . " This is already better . So broadcast it . But ... " attract each other " . I 'll omit this too . - This is useless titillation . - All right . Broadcast it . - And what about the gender ? - What about it ? Wait , I have it ! And this way it will be without consequences . " There are people on Earth . " Right ? It 's not so shocking , and at same time it 's true . Ha ! Where is my report ? Here . Yansky ! We 'll deal with this together . What do you look like ? You are dismissed . The representant of the ecological committee of the UN . Ah , so that 's him . Could you please tell us what your first impressions were of your visit to us ? There he is ! Really , you 're right . Sometimes even in your case it 's possible to talk about intelligence . Doctor . - I didn 't suspect that you know it . - We scientists are one family . Doctor Yansky is my best co-worker . The pillar of our institution . - Have you seen Mr. Cimrman here ? - He 's at yours . Master Miller ! I have read in Scientist your essay about the curvature of space . Your hypothesis is absolutely crazy . But these days crazy hypotheses have the right to be applied . Congratulations . Professor Horowitz . I 'm telling you here on this grain of space dust they tap excellent beer . Come . I suppose , space is curved like this . - I agree . But ... - There isn 't any " but " . But ... Everyone to saloon 6 , please . Everyone to saloon 6 , please . I suppose it 's curved like this . You mean like this and at the same time also like this . Well it 's grandiose ! This is a revolutionary idea ! And at the same time it 's beautiful . Please follow me to saloon 6 . Fantastic ! And at the end of the symposium I have the honour of showing you the result of the work of our institution . The first successful samples of synthetic food . Please . Fantastic ! It needs some mustard . - And now I 'm inviting you to ... - Sorry ? ... a little refreshment . Don 't worry about it , they don 't understand it . Men . Do you know how it will lighten the work for us employed women ? Someday in the future all of us will eat this way . All over the world . Even before starting the live transmission we have to get you familiar with one interesting thing . There 's an increasing number of reports , that visitors from distant planets move among us The latest report of this sort came to us from Joseph Vanyerka . He claims that he spotted a spacecraft . What did it look like ? Can you describe it to us ? Like a dumpster . Here you have it dear audience , most of these cases when confronted with clear scientific thinking are revealed as sheer nonsense . We thank Mr. Joseph Vanyerka . This way , please . - Pray , because ... - Just like a dumpster . - Please , the conference . - Just like a big dumpster . Dear spectators , utilizing the international symposium and with live broadcasting from the Milton hotel scientists of world significance will answer your questions . Profesor Elington , please . Thank you . This is a sample of rock originating from Mars , that the probe M356 just brought from this mysterious planet . Bravo ! Will this piece of space stuff answer the question that has been bothering people for centuries ? So far we 've been researching it in our laboratories . Even the first results have brought some exciting prospects . If we expose this sample to beams of the slightest intensity it will begin to warm intensively . Please , see for yourself . Please . - What are you drinking chairman ? - Well , it 's a medicine , I 'm suffering from gall stones . Seven billions ... in the shit hole . Well , now we have another question . Joseph Beysovec from Vamberka asks : What do you think of dwarf stars ? Professor Miller , please . Dwarf stars are stars with a hormonal disorder . In fact they are stars that didn 't grow into the regular size . Also I can assure you , that in space most stars are precisely according to the norm . - It 's unheard of ! - On the contrary . Bravo . One of your theories is better than the other . Gentlemen , quiet please . Here is another question . Marie Brnena from Uvaly asks , Do intelligent beings live in space ? Professor Nowak will answer He 's an expert on space civilizations . Please . We have evidence that there is no place in space with such a high density of intelligent creatures - like there is on Earth . - It 's mystification ! - Where is this evidence ? - Space civilizations exist ! But gentlemen ! It doesn 't make sense to look for civilizations in space while our own civilization slowly ceases to exist . It 's unacceptable defeatism . The principles of evolution are the same throughout the whole universe . What 's that ? If in the universe there are the same principles of evolution like on Earth , then potential inhabitants of other planets would certainly go mad like us . Gentlemen . Earth pidlivization , excuse me , civilization is great . There is nothing so perfect , you can 't find it in this galaxy , or even in the whole universe . When compared to what is happening on Earth , there is nothing happening at all on other space objects . Except for banal eruptions of poisonous matter . By the time the most developed planet in space invents such a fantastic thing , for example the television or the water closet , billions of years will have passed away . " Professors Nowak and Miller have arrived . " In Zurich they got on a different coach to Hawaii by mistake . Where should I sit them ? " Nowak ... Miller ? Inhabitants of Earth are reasonable beings . They are able to think , use instruments and invent new things . The most reasonable humans are called scientists . Scientists congregate in research institutions , where they attend to organised reasonable activity . A group of scientists are called a scientific team . Scientific teams commit discoveries , which bring benefit to the whole of mankind . The highest form of reasonable activity on Earth is the scientific symposium . They resolve the ill-effects of beneficial scientific work . Particular scientists are tagged with labels , so they don 't get confused . The more scientific teams , the more life on Earth is better and more beautiful . If it continues like this , soon life on Earth will be absolutely perfect . So that was our last greeting from Earth . What could they be doing there at ours ? At home ? Nothing . You know them . - Doctor Yansky . - Dear doctor . - Our mission is complete . - We are flying back . You 've provided priceless service to the idea of interspace cooperation . - The whole galaxy is proud of you . - Congratulations . I ... One moment . I also have to thank you . So thanks for everything , and see you later sometime . No , no " see you later " . I know that we caused you certain inconveniences . But now it 's the end of this . We are going back home . We are already fed up with you also . Don 't take it personally . - Otherwise you are very nice . - To your health . When our official delegation comes here , we will bring you a decoration . You golden boy ! I will mount the little horse ... Sing with me . When I join the army Everyone ! And you , my dear - Call me Pepa . - Hi , Pepa . - What should I call you ? - Whatever you like , Pepa . - For example , can I call you monster ? - You can , Pepa . - And I will also call you monster . - Call me monster 2 , - so there 's order in it . - Bye , monsters . Bye , Pepa . Boys , I like you . Yirinka ! These are my friends from space . Nice to meet you , I 'm the princess of Monaco . They are just flying back .

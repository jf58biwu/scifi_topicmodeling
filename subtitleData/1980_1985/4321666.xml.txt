 What about your contact ? JO : Out of operation . I 'm gonna have to bring the payload in myself . SAINT JOHN : The stuff is too hot . Listen to me , Jo . Watch your tail . They will arrest me the minute we land in Communist territory . The Company will get Jo out . We 're not sitting around on our thumbs waiting for ' em . ( SCREAMS ) SVETLANA : You traitor ! ( BOTH CLAMORING ) Let them kill each other . The game 's over . Not yet . ( GUN FIRES ) ( METALLIC SCRAPING ) ( SHOUTS ) ( ALL CLAMORING ) ( HORN HONKING ) MALE REPORTER : Svetlana ! You are living in Texas now . How does it compare to Moscow ? It is flat . There is no place for KGB to hide . ( ALL LAUGH ) ( REPORTERS CLAMORING ) Svetlana , since defecting to the United States from the Soviet Union , do you fear any kind of reprisals ? We Americans are not afraid of anything . ( ALL CHUCKLE ) I 'm sorry . I have a plane to catch . ( PHONE RINGING ) It 's Jo . Uh , ran into some bad weather . I had to make some changes midstream . Where are the bandits ? Lost them for now , but one of them got a good look at me . I 'm just about to leave for Stockholm . What about your contact ? JO : Out of operation . I 'm gonna have to bring the payload in myself . No , no , the stuff is too hot . Look , just have a room waiting for me with a big bath , okay ? Saint John , I 'll be fine . SAINT JOHN : Listen to me , Jo . ( SIGHS ) Watch your tail . Right . Oh , excuse me . You ? You 're the person who almost knocked me down at the hotel . Sorry . I 'll try not to do it again . So , she beat two of your best agents and escaped . One man was wounded , but Gorssi is on his way back to Bulgaria now . She 's left a trail ? One of our men spotted someone matching her description board a flight to Stockholm . If she makes the Stockholm delivery , we 'll look like fools at the summit . Moscow will eat us alive . Get her ! The Americans used their fighters to force a commercial jet to land in the name of combating terrorism . Ah , what a lovely precedent . Why don 't you have Gorssi meet her . MALE PILOT : Please remain calm . It seems we have a military escort forcing us to land in Bulgaria . Now , I 'm sure we 'll rectify the situation shortly . In the meantime , please cooperate with your flight attendants . Relax . You 'll be okay . Get your hands off me . Oh , it 's okay . My friend is just a little airsick . You don 't understand ! Yes , I do . You 've defected and we 're heading for Bulgaria . But they will arrest me the minute we land in Communist territory . Your only chance is to keep quiet when we go through Customs . Bulgaria says they brought the plane down because of a possible bomb scare . Yeah , and I 've got a bridge in Minsk I 'd like you to look at . We shouldn 't have let Jo go on this assignment alone . I didn 't see them offering us a choice . Besides , Jo was the most familiar with the setup in Istanbul . I know , I know , and the summit conference is in two days . If we don 't get the proof that Bulgaria is lying about those missiles , it 's gonna be a disaster for us . So what 's this ? A birthday party for Jo ? So get her and the files out . You sure you want Arkov ? Well , he 's our best bet . He 's our only bet . Passport ? Passport ? Linskaya . Linsky . That 's Russian . My parents . Passport ? Over there . Passport ? Just be calm . I don 't have time for games . This man stole classified material and gave it to you . You shot an agent to get away . Where are your overlays ? What are overlays ? You 're an American agent . My partner ... I 'm an American citizen . I demand to speak to my embassy . We already know who you are , Miss Santini . ( DOOR OPENS ) ( EXHALES ) This has been a day . Not only have we captured an American spy , but also a convicted Soviet traitor . I am an American . She is the reason we brought your plane down . She carries an item the Soviets wouldn 't want in the hands of the West . She is a stranger to me . Perhaps . You will both be tried as enemies of peace and global cooperation . We just met on the plane . Then I hope you become friends . Where you 're going , you 'll need one . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean for you to get involved . You 're sorry ? God in heaven , I 'm dead ! I escaped from hell , now you have put me back ! We 're entering European airspace . We have a lukewarm trail on Arkov ending at Stockholm . That 's where we 'll start . Any word on Jo ? LOCKE : Negative . The Bulgarians released the plane , but they kept two women passengers . One fits Jo 's description to the " T. " The other was Svetlana Linsky . The gymnast who defected ? Affirmative . That 's a tough break . They 'll treat her like a convicted criminal . Saint John , the Company will get Jo out . We 're not sitting around on our thumbs waiting for ' em . Tell the Company bloodhounds to heat up Arkov 's trail . I want to meet . I just hope Arkov keeps it down to that . ( DOG BARKING ) Stara Zagora . The satellite photos don 't do it justice . ( WHISPERS ) No ! I could have hidden it . ( SPEAKING RUSSIAN ) We heard rumor Americans were coming . I worked at your embassy once . Why are you here ? I work at your embassy once ! Are you all right ? There is nothing you can do for her . You are Svetlana Linskaya . Tanya Rostovich . I am a pianist . I was . Oh , my ! I saw you make a perfect 10 on the uneven parallel bars . I bribed the guard . It 's a little melody , just so I won 't forget . You don 't trust the American ? The guard outside accidentally dropped his knife . I could have gotten it . She stopped me . The coward . She saved your life . It 's true . It 's a guards ' trick . They drop something . You go for it . They haul you to ice box and beat you . Or worse . They don 't mind telling the Politburo you were shot escaping . I suppose you expect me to thank you . ( SCOFFS ) You 're welcome . ( ALARM BUZZES ) ( DOG BARKING ) This American , she prevented an example being made of the defector Linskaya . She is very smart ? Smart enough not to go for the knife . Then we work harder . We have 36 hours before the summit to learn if she passed the information on . She will resist . Of course she will . But in the end , I will break her . Whatever it takes . ( ALARM BLARES ) What ? What was it ? Our clock . Every hour on the hour , all night long . They say it 's to let us know the time . Every day ? You can tell the deaf ones around here . They can sleep . And you stop caring about the time when it 's endless . Well , I don 't have any intention of staying in here . Go to sleep . My children . Who took my children ? ( SOBBING ) The mind goes first . You seem to have a good tight grip on yours . Physicists are tough old birds . My husband used to say it 's our only saving grace . Where 's your husband now ? God knows . Dead , I pray , for his sake . He believed too much in the science of preservation rather than nuclear destruction and became an embarrassment to the state . A physicist could help me . ( LAUGHS ) You don 't need physics in here . ( DOOR OPENING ) This one . Take her . You , come now ! So , good morning . Let 's see if we can straighten this matter out . Send me home and we 'll call it even . Unfortunately , I can 't . You were arrested for smuggling documents concerning my country . Now , I need to know what information you were able to pass on to your colleagues . I need to know how complete your data was . I can 't help you . Life 's too short for can 'ts , Miss Santini , especially around here . Think about it . The United States thinks you 're dead . Only my brother died . It should have been me . Jo , are you all right ? JO : Yeah . I 'm fine . My children . Where are my children ? GUARD : See . Over there . Your children are waiting for you . No , Elana . No ! No , stop ! You can 't . ( ELANA EXCLAIMS ) Arkov . Saint John . Long time . I thought you 'd just drop in . I 'll laugh at your jokes , Arkov , after you help me get a friend out of Bulgaria . Jo Santini . A convicted spy . You are even a bigger fool than the last time we met . As I recall , Arkov , it took this fool to get your backside out of Angola . ( CHUCKLES ) Not one of my better moments , but not enough to turn a bargain . I 'm not here to turn any . Any more than Katrine would . The life of your friend for what ? A memory . I seem to remember a little girl that needed a quick hop in a helicopter to get the operation that would save her life . I can only hope that you will have a son one day , so my Katrine can break his heart . Will I hear from you ? We 'll see . Your friend may already be lost . ( DOG BARKING ) ( ALARM BLARES ) JO : 8 : 00 . Your spy satellite will be here for next seven hours , yes ? Yes . This was simple problem . If I could only play the piano in here , like you play with numbers . We 'll never get out of here . It 's a waste of time even dreaming about it . It 's not a waste , Svetlana . That 's a promise . ( DOOR OPENS ) You look like you might listen to reason now . A little information and this stops . You go back to your America . You think I believe that ? You don 't have the luxury of what to believe anymore . Because I 'm dead either way , so I might as well make you as uncomfortable as possible . ( CHUCKLING ) And how is that possible ? Moscow isn 't going to be giving you any merit badges if I 'm dead and you don 't get any information . So ... Rot in here . Base to Airwolf . Don 't ask how , but we just received a message from EastSat . It was sent by Jo . It reads , " Send in the cavalry . " The satellite has picked up her coordinates . We know where she is , Saint John ! Get the word to Arkov . The cavalry is on the way . COMMANDANT : It is an honor to have you here . It isn 't often ... Please , don 't waste time . Leave us . What is your progress ? Our countries sit at the summit table in less than 24 hours . We know the schedule . Then you also know we must assure our superiors the West has no proof of the Bulgarian missiles . The consequences for everyone concerned will be most grave . She had nothing ! She had nothing you could see . She was searched . Closely enough to reveal a microdot ? You poor thing ! Did I miss anything ? No . There you are . Thanks . Bring water over here . Hurry ! I told them how this could never happen in America . It does if you don 't pay your taxes . You are free there . Well , it 's not perfect , but Svetlana is right . I was to perform there . My brother and I were going to defect . I do not deserve to even dream of freedom . Everyone deserves freedom . ( WHISTLES BLOWING ) Now what ? ( GUARDS CHATTERING ) Lice inspection . ( GUARD YELLS IN PAIN ) ( ALL CLAMORING ) ( WOMEN SCREAMING ) Are you all right ? No . I 'm scared for Cosima . She has written her own death sentence . Please , if you try to escape , take me with you . ( SCREAMS ) Would you like to look at my teeth ? I have to slap you . They 're outside . It 's nothing personal . You don 't mind if I take the pain personally , do you ? Does the KGB acknowledge pain ? If there was only more time for pleasantries . Forgive me . ( SCREAMS ) I will also have to search you . Do not say another word . You are a polite son of a ... ( SHUSHING ) The Commandant didn 't believe me , but I say the American is KGB . Sent to test us and to get the gymnast . I know she is KGB . You believe them ? No . The others do . They will kill Jo . ( ALL WHISPERING ) Don 't worry . Don 't interfere . No matter what I do . Saint John sends his regards . Be in the yard tomorrow morning , 9 : 00 , and you 'll see him . You 're Arkov . As far as you 're concerned , I 'm Prince Charming . Would you settle for Beauty and the Beast ? I 'd settle for a one-way ticket home . I 'd like to see you get it . But first , you must have a microdot . What microdot ? ( EXHALING ) Saint John was right . You 're very beautiful . And stubborn . All right . I 'll tell them I couldn 't find anything . Pray to God they 're as dumb as they act . Remember , 9 : 00 . Thanks . SVETLANA : You traitor ! You KGB ! Scum ! ( ALL CLAMORING ) Let them kill each other . That 's enough ! Enough ! Take them both to isolation . It 's over . Kill them in the morning . Dispose of the bodies before that bastard Arkov gets back . JO : What the hell 's going on ? You can kill each other in here . JO : Svetlana , what ... ( SVETLANA SHUSHING ) What the hell 's going on ? The guard started a rumor that you were really KGB . The other women would 've killed you . ( SIGHS ) I had to get you out of there . But why now of all times ? You stopped me from taking that knife when we first got here . My friends were coming in the morning . But we 've got to be out in the yard for them to get us out of here . And I put you in here . It 's not your fault . ( SIGHS ) How close to the border ? We just entered Bulgarian airspace . Boost stealth . These mountain passes are slowing us down . You want to burn fuel or stay off their scanners ? Bottom line ? I want Jo back . Your friends , maybe they can break in here . By the time they found us , they 'd be dodging the whole Bulgarian Air Force . Jo ! Svetlana ! Cosima , what are you doing ? They 'll find you here . I 've come to let you out . I won 't lie for them ! Tell me . What ? They will shoot you once you step outside . They promised me freedom if I betrayed you , but I couldn 't do that . Not after what you 've done for me . I won 't lie to you . Cosima ! We won 't go . We don 't deserve to die . I want to talk to the Commandant . He won 't listen to us . We need time . Help me . We 'll tell the Commandant what he wants to know . He 'll put you in here unless you take us to him . I 'm ready to talk . Take them to the Commandant . Here , take these . LOCKE : Base to Airwolf , do you read me ? Go ahead , base . Arkov has just contacted one of our people in Stockholm . The Bulgarians are eliminating Jo at dawn . Can Arkov get her off the hook ? Not likely . He says he 's already overstayed his welcome . You 're overstepping your diplomatic privileges , comrade . We always need fodder for low level spy exchanges . I can use her . If you took a fancy to her while you were here , you should have made the best of it . I did not know there was any hurry after we found that she didn 't have what we wanted . She knows too much about our methods . So , perhaps I can make her forget . The only sure way is to eliminate her . Who ordered them out ? What 's going on ? I ordered them killed . What are they doing here ? I 've decided to talk . The game 's over . Not yet . Guards ! Sound the alarm ! Secure the prison ! ( ALARM BLARING ) They won 't get you . Kill her and the defector ! Air support ! Air support ! ( WOMEN SCREAMING ) Cosima ! Come on , you can make it . You taught me what it means to be alive . Again . No , Cosima ! Come on . Let 's go ! Come on , Jo , just hold on . Wish me luck . Let 's go ! Everybody intact ? Almost everybody . So Arkov came through . Too bad he got the microdot . I didn 't think Arkov would give up that easily . Nothing was easy in there , Saint John , believe me . I hear your efforts paid off in spades at the summit . Just don 't call me Mata Hari . Mike says you pulled out all the stops to get me out , including enlisting Arkov 's help . He 's something else . I take it he impressed you . Well , he does have a style all his own . He reminds me of somebody else I know . I must learn gymnastics myself . I wanted to say a proper goodbye . Oh ! SVETLANA : And thank you . We owe you all so much . I discovered what my freedom really means . You ladies will be happy to know that we 'll be sending your reports to Amnesty International to help close down Stara Zagora . That would make Cosima happy . I won 't forget her . I won 't forget any of you . Make that a promise and we 'll let you go . On one condition . You come back . Actually , I was going to ask for tickets to see the International Gymnastics competition next week . ( ALL CHUCKLING ) Jo .

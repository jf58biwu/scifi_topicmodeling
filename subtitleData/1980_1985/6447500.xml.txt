 Stop him ! Damn it ! Get her back ! They 're getting away ! Stop him ! Go around ! There they are ! Stop right there ! Stand back ! Yoshimitsu-sama ... I accept my defeat . This is my destiny . I accept my defeat . I accept my destiny . Please understand that . Hold it ! Yoshimitsu-sama ! Look . There 's a cave down there . Maybe it was formed by the river stream . Hmm . Wow . Look at this . I wonder how long this cave has been around . Hmm . Geez . It 's kind of spooky . It 's fine . It 's cold in here . I don 't want to go any further . Then , you stay here . I 'll go check a little bit deeper . I first heard about it on the news . A few scattered reports of a 400-year-old body found frozen in the ice . It was the kind of story that sparks the imagination , gives newscasters something to joke about , and then fades into oblivion . For me , it was a job opportunity . And , at first , this looked like just another assignment ... Excuse me , I have an appointment with Dr. Richards . - I 'm Alan Richards . - Hi . I 'm Chris Welles . Yes , I know . Thank you . How do you do ? Let 's get to work , shall we ? You know what this is about ? President Shogun ? What else have you heard ? They found this man frozen in ice , chipped him out , and sent him to you for an autopsy . Well , it 's more than that . Much more . My field is Oriental History , and they questioned me closely , trying to determine the limits of my experience . My weak point was that I could speak little Japanese . But they let that pass . Something more important was on their minds . They weren 't going to perform an autopsy . They were going to bring that man back to life . - Body fluids , stable . - Good . Dr. Richards , double-check please . Very good , Ellie . Carl , do you have a reading on cerebral stats ? 35.9 ... 36 . 7.5 minutes to stabilized brain temperature before neuro-disintegration . Carl , brainwave stats . Brainwave monitor functioning is steady at zero . Very well . What 's your body core temperature ? Fahrenheit 98.4 , .5 , .6 ... We have critical . Engage thermal capacitor , now . One thing , if this goes wrong , anybody finds out about it ... I hear you . Scalpel . Let 's do it . Suction . Cerebral and core , steady at 36 . Cardiac stimulant , mark ? 90 seconds , mark . Respirator on ... now . Okay , Carl , let 's hook him up . Stand by for bypass . Pumping . Ready for electro-shock . - Sixty seconds . - Okay . Stand by . Fifty-five seconds ... - Clear . - Hit it . ALAN : Nothing . What 's the count ? - Forty seconds . - Clear . Go . Thirty seconds . - We 're running out of time , Alan . - I know , I know . Come on , let 's do it ! Let 's go ! Up the volt ! - Clear . - Again . Flush him out , Ellie . Twenty . Hit it , Pete . - Ten seconds . - Goddamn it , hit it , Pete ! Wait . Listen . - We did it . - We did it ! We have brain activity ! Beautiful . That 's beautiful . Weeks passed , and the samurai 's condition continued to improve . I went about my research as discreetly as possible , for Alan had ordered complete secrecy . The Institute and his career were on the line . This is something special . It suggests a real master . It looks sharp . The old katana had the sharpest , hardest , best-tempered blades in the world . They were the soul of the samurai . The great swords - - and this is a great one - - were thought to have a life of their own . A spirit , the embodiment of bushido . - The Way of the Warrior . - Yes . A samurai spent his entire life preparing for death . So at the critical moment , he could face it without hesitation . And the autopsy ? How is it going ? I 'm not supposed to discuss it . I 'll be in touch . I look forward to it . Thank you , Professor . Bye-bye . Hi , stranger . What do you got for me ? Not much so far , but I did some research on the sword . These are a real find , Alan . They 're made by Kunimitsu , one of the greatest swordsmiths ever . These are the best of the best . They 're worth a fortune on the open market . Great . He was a first-rate samurai , a master . Well , I wonder what he 's going to think of us . Oh ... Oh , my God . Oh , my ... Stay there . Don 't move ! Just stay right there ! Stay right there . Dr. Richards ! Dr. Richards ! Fantastic . Incredible . This is truly incredible . - What 's he saying ? - I can 't make it out . Yoshi ... something . - That must be his name . - Yoshi . We took his swords . We shouldn 't have done that . No one 's going to hurt him . Tell him that . No one 's going to hurt you . Look at him . We 've got to show him that this isn 't a nightmare , that he 's not crazy . - Can I get his things ? - You want to return his swords ? We have to . It 's his only link to the world he knows . So ? So , if we don 't , he 'll think he 's a prisoner . A samurai would prefer death . Be ready for anything . Let 's leave him for now . Hi . Day after day , I surrounded him with things from his past . And day after day , I studied him , hoping for a sign of trust , of recognition of anything . Go on . Sake . Sake . Those swords , what are they worth ? No , really , how much ? More than most people make in a lifetime . How 's the patient ? Why does he do that ? Maybe he doesn 't like you . No , I 'm serious . I 'm worried about brain damage . He doesn 't respond very well . Now , you . No , it doesn 't work like that . Okay , Charlie , I want the swords ! Jonathan ... Jonathan Martin ...

That 's a terminal mishap of major proportions . And you tell me it 's just a simple robbery . Okay , we 're all going downtown to get this straightened out . Brody ! Now ! Load ' em up . Over here !

How long are you going to keep us here ? - Till you tell me the truth . - I told you the truth . Hey , Harry , get a load of this . Some nut dressed like a samurai just chopped up three guys on South and Third . You know , I ain 't never seen nothing like that in all my days as a military man , and I 've seen plenty ! You 're a military man , too . I knew it the minute I laid eyes on you . Name 's Walsh . Master Sergeant William George Washington Walsh . United States Army , Retired . Oh , I served in the Pacific , too . No hard feelings . I spent 30 years in the Army . Been everywhere , seen everything . And what do I get ? 750 dollars the first Tuesday of each month . And a bunch or rotten no-good dope fiends try to rip that off . Gets you mad , you know ? Hey , I got an idea ! Come on . Come on . We have to find Yoshi . Forget it . Let the police handle it . We 've got to find him . He can 't survive out there . I hope to hell that he doesn 't . You really mean that . Jesus ! There 's a friend of mine in here I want you to meet . Come on in . Hey , Willie-san ! Hello , sir ! - Where 'd you pick up the samurai ? - It 's a long story . I 'll tell you this much , if it weren 't for him , I wouldn 't be here . He just saved my life . Right ? Right . Friend . Friend . Is that who I think it is ? Toshiro Mifune ! I told you this place was hot . You try talking to him . I don 't think he speaks any English . - What 's he saying ? - Some weird dialect , man . I only got about every other word . But I 'll tell you this ... He 's a wacko . I knew Yoshi had to be stopped . But how ? The police would do it any way they could . And Alan ... There was no telling what he 'd do . Biru ! Yoshimitsu-sama ... Yoshimitsu-sama . Come on ! Get back ! Banzai , you in there ? You hear me ? Come out , Banzai ! I got a surprise for you ! - We got trouble ! - Hey , Nip ! Big trouble . Eat up , man , it 's your last one ! Finish it good , man ! - Come on out ! - You in there , Banzai ? Hey , friend , wait a minute . Wait a minute . Where are you going ? Hey , Nip ! I want you ! - Banzai ! Come out ! - Yeah , man ! - Come on ! - Let 's see you do some chicken shit ! Banzai ! It 's a trap , friend ! Let 's cross this outta here ! Come on , Banzai ! - Is he coming ? - Yeah , he 's coming . And we 're going to blow his yellow brains out . Damn fool . Hey , Slant Eyes ! Hey , Nip ! Come and get me ! Over here ! Hey , Banzai , over here ! No , not there ! Over here ! You shouldn 't have clone what you done to my friends . Now you 're going to pay ! - Hey , Johnny ! - Yo ! They got Fist , man ! Get that bastard ! Yeah , right . Bandito ! Fist ! Your pals are finished ! Hey , old man ! Old man , I quit ! You gotta be kidding me . Sayonara , sucker . No ! Hey ! You 're not going in there ? You 're crazy . Yoshimitsu-san ! Yoshimitsu-san ! What happened ? Forget what happened . - Are you his friend ? - Yes . Get him the hell outta here , then . - But you need help . - But nothing ... The cops are going to be here any minute . What 's going to happen when they try to put the cuffs on him ? You 're right . Come on . Please . Go ! Go ! No . Yoshimitsu-san ... Your friend ... Your friend will be all right . Go . Go . Come on . Alan , that Detective Berger was on the phone . Yoshi destroyed a restaurant downtown . He 's killed three more people . Oh , God . But Berger said that the samurai left with a woman who matches Chris 's description . I don 't believe it . Have they found her yet ? No , but they 're watching her apartment . She 's too smart to go there . We have to find her first . We 've gotta put an end to this thing . How can we ? The police don 't even know where to look . I know where to look . That man cannot exist . He is a ghost , a phantom . Or a hoax . He 's real , Professor . And he needs our help . It is not that simple , Chris . He is samurai - - Yoshi , as you call him , was a great warrior in his world . He tried to seclude himself from the endless wars that plagued his homeland . He found a young wife , Chidori , and grew to love her very much . The last thing he remembers , Chidori was kidnapped by a rival clan and killed before his eyes . He is still very confused about what happened and where he is . But we can help him . He can have a new life . As I said , he is samurai . That decision must be his . I will be back soon . Thank you . Bye . Yoshi 's world and mine differed in almost every way . To watch him learn is to rediscover miracles in the everyday things around us . Lamp Light . Yoshi-san ... Yoshimitsu-sama ... Chidori ... Professor ? Hello , Chris . - I won 't let you take him . - You don 't have much to say about it . - I 'll call Detective Berger . - Well , that 's a great idea . What happens when the SWAT team arrives ? Yoshi-san . Alan , what 's happening ? No ! - You killed him ! - He 's just stunned . For now . - Come on , move it . - Hey , don 't ! Out of the way . Inside . Wait ! What are you doing ? Get in ! Alan , for God 's sake- - ! Hey ! Damn it , Alan . Tell me what you 're doing . I 'm going to do what I was contracted to do . I 'm going to do an autopsy . God ... That 's murder . Nonsense . He 's been dead for over 400 years . Don 't give me that crap . I can prove that Yoshi was dead when I got him . If he 's still dead when the police find him , they 'll have no case . Yoshi will have the perfect alibi . But you 're not to blame . Nobody 's to blame . - We didn 't do anything ! - Do you think they 'll believe that ? Nobody answers the phone around here ? Take your hands off me . Homicide . Carlyle . Hello . Detective Berger , please . Berger 's not here . Can I take a message ? The samurai and Chris have been kidnapped , taken to the Institute . Samu-what 's been taken where ? Samurai . The samurai . Hurry ! Yeah , right . Prep a vein . What are you doing ? What 's in that needle ? Just air . Great stuff . Very inexpensive and impossible to trace . - Pete ! - Hey , Chris , it 's the only way . There 's no need for that . - No ! No ! - Chris , please ! - Give me a hand here . - Chris , please ! Now ! Pete , goddamn it , give me a hand . Go on , do it now . What the hell 's going on back there ? Stop him , Pete , for God 's sake ! Stop him ! Oh ! - Jesus Christ ! Pete ! - Alan , wait ! Damn it ! Pete ... Pete , give me a hand ! Stop the van , Carl ! Stop the van ! - Hey ! - Stop the van ! Stop the van ! - Drive , Carl ! - Just drive ! God ! God ! - No ! - No ! - Oh , God ! Oh , Jesus ! - No ! Yoshimitsu-san , no ! Thank God . Hey , Berger . - When did you get this ? - Five , ten minutes ago . - It 's important ? - Yeah ... Brody ! Don 't rush off . Hey ! Hey , hold it ! Hold it ! What the hell happened to you ? Yoshi seemed guided by instinct ... Instinct and years of training . Whatever his secret , he knew exactly what he was doing . We think they went that way . You guys be careful . They 're armed . - Armed with what ? - Samurai swords . - Say again ? - You heard me . Load him up . Three-Papa-Six . We have a report the suspect is headed toward the lake . Do you copy ? This is Berger , I copy . Out . - That 's it , that 's all I know . - Well , it 's a start . Three-Papa-Six , this is Volcker . We have a confirmed sighting . Suspect and victim are just below Baker 's Rock . He 's definitely headed toward the lake . Over . - Are you finished with me ? - Yeah . You wanna ride ? No , they brought my car down from the Institute . Joe ! Get over here ! Air-12 , this is Ground Control . Please confirm destination , over . Roger that , Ground Control . This is Air-12 . We are en route to link up with the Volcker Unit . Over . This is the police . I repeat , this is the police . You are under arrest ! Freeze , right where you are ! Yoshimitsu-san ! Watch him , he 's making a break for it . Okay , cowboy . - It 's okay ! You 're going to be okay ! - No , I 'm all right ! Let me go ! Let me go ! - I see him . Coming around the curve . - Yeah . Yeah , there he is . I got him . Stay on him . - Stay on him . - I got him . We got it . Going to be a quick Code 4 . Damn . I lost him . - What ? - I lost him . He 's behind us . Turn back . Volcker , this is Air-12 . We 've lost contact with the suspect . Come back , Air-12 . Please repeat transmission . We 've lost contact with the suspect . We think he 's doubled back toward your position . Negatory , Air-12 , we haven 't seen a thing . Keep looking . He 's gotta be just up ahead of you . Roger . I 'm taking the girl over to Berger . Keep me posted . - You lost him ? - Nah , they 'll get him . We 'll have this wrapped up before dawn . Hey ! There ! Get him ! Hey ! Watch it ! I got him ! I got him ! You 'll hit the girl . Suspect headed up to Fire Road ! He 's got the girl ! Get me a car up here , right away ! Damn it . This is Berger , I 'm going to take the Ridge Road up to the lake . Volcker , move it ! This is Air-12 . We are on route to intercept suspect . Roger , Air-12 . It looks like they 're headed toward the cliff . No ! No ! Yoshi , stop ! Go back ! I don 't want to hurt you , Chris . Get away from him . Don 't be stupid , Chris . Get away from him ! - Get out of the way , Chris ! - Alan ! - Get the hell out of the way ! - It won 't do any good , now ! Oh , for God 's sake , Yoshi , don 't do it ! Yoshi-san ! Yoshi ! Please ! Don 't shoot ! Hold your fire ! Yoshi-san ! Please ... What was it he said to you ? Right there , before the end . He said , " There are no second chances . The way of the samurai is death . " Yeah .

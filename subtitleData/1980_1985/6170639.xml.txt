 It is a great honour for her . So everybody keeps telling me . - One day you 'll ... - One day I 'll understand . Yes , everybody keeps saying that , too . - What are you doing here ? - Remembering . You too are here remembering , I think . Why did you give her to the Tripods ? I am the champion of the Count and Eloise is beautiful . - There was no other choice . - What about her cousin ? The one who was with you . The one you should have chosen . What of her ? - Did you love Eloise ? - No , but we should have been happy . Perhaps we would have learned to love each other . But then you arrived , Englishman . We were in love . What I cannot have , no one else shall have . It was what she deserved and what you deserved also . For you the future is good , Englishman . For the Count 's son , everything is permitted . There will be other girls as beautiful as Eloise . Your life will be happy and free . Free ? Who is free ? ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) entreat . COUNTESS : Ah , Guillaume . COUNT : Come in , my boy . Sit down . You 'll take some wine ? Thank you . Santé . Eloise was your only daughter ? Yes , she is our only daughter . We are very proud of her today . But she 's been taken away . Yes , to serve the Tripods in their city . - What does it mean to serve them ? - Ellie , the servants here serve us . COUNTESS : She was very happy . You saw that , Will . The Tripods do not come every year to the tournament . It is only usual at the new year for the capping . But you 'll never see her again ! You 're surely not afraid for Eloise ? She 's gone. just as if she 'd drowned . How can you say that ? We do not understand the Tripods and all their ways , it is true . But they give us their trust . They give us freedom . We were to be married . She was to be my wife . I was to be a part of the family . You still are part of us and always will be . Be happy with us , my boy . Tonight at dinner , you will sit at our side . Sir , I ask permission to miss the banquet . No . Guillaume , you have much to learn , and it is important to begin the learning now . The banquet , to others , our guests , it is a pleasure . But to us , it is a duty . A duty not to be sad . We must set the example . Yes , we must . Take your horse . Ride . Get the wind on your face . ( BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH ) ( PLAYING SOFT MUSIC ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) ( INAUDIBLE ) ( INAUDIBLE ) ( TRIPOD SCREECHING ) WILL : Steady . Steady , boy . ( SCREAMING ) Come on , boy . Come on . ( SIGHS IN RELIEF ) - We thought we heard someone on a horse . - We thought you were a Black Guard . - We 've seen two today . - You scared me stupid . Well , that 's not hard . I see things are now back to normal . - We thought you weren 't going to come . - I said I would . - And Eloise ? Where is Eloise ? - Yeah . - Howell won the tournament ? - Salazar . - It 's good , isn 't it ? - Pity we have to leave it . We could take turns riding the horse . Well , three boys on foot , no questions asked . One boy on one horse , the same . But , three boys with one horse ... We could sell him . Whether we sell him or ride him , there will be questions . Well , let 's keep him for now , we 'll see what happens . - Beanpole . - Hmm ? I think a Tripod is only a sort of carriage . No , it 's a living thing . We 've seen them walking , trampling . They have arms . I don 't think so . I think it 's ... Well , like this boat was . Or the carriages we saw in Paris . - What do you think it carries , then ? - WILL : I don 't know . You mean that each Tripod has a driver ? Of flesh and blood ? Of human flesh and blood ? If a Tripod attacked somebody , took him inside , why would it let him go ? - Ellie , they 'd be capped . - No . You mean you know someone who 's been inside a Tripod ? - Howell ? - Me . - You 're making it up . - I wish I was . I was riding away from the chateau and this Tripod almost stepped on me . It grabbed me . I felt winded and shocked , I remember that . And I remember seeing the panel underneath slide open . Just for a moment , I thought I saw a shape . - Did you see inside ? - If I did , I can 't remember . I woke up on the ground . It had been dark and now it was sunny . I felt sort of dazed . Well , I bet the horse threw you and you hit your head . No , I don 't ... I just don 't know . BEANPOLE : What you say is not impossible , Will . It had not occurred to me that perhaps humans drive the Tripods . Anyway , we shall talk of it in the morning . You should sleep . Okay . It 's always the same distance , from bank to bank . - It doesn 't wind like an ordinary river . - No , men have made this . You think everything out of the ordinary is made by men . - You can 't make a river . - It is a type of them DE fer . All right . If it is a them DE fer , where are the stations ? What is it ? It 's not a thing . It 's a city . - The City of Gold . - How do you know this , Will ? - The city of the Tripods . - No wonder we 've heard so many . You asked me where Eloise is . Eloise is there . She was capped all the time . I never guessed . She looked so young . And Salazar chose her to serve the Tripods . The Count 's champion has that choice . It was a great honour . That 's what they all told me . Eloise said that , too . And now she serves them there in their city . I shall go there one day . And I shall bring her back . One day . Don 't you believe me ? - Yes , Will . - We believe you . ( TRIPOD SCREECHING ) - That was close . - Still is . Why is it attacking us ? - We could be capped already . - We 've been followed for several days . Why not attack before ? Maybe it wants to know what we 're doing . Well , it can 't follow us if it can 't see us . BEANPOLE : Henry ! Come on help . We can escape through the smoke . - I 'm not sure . - Oh , have you got a better idea ? ( TRIPOD SCREECHING ) - What is it ? - Water , I think . I don 't know . Come on , come on . We should be safe in here . For a while at least . There 's no way a Tripod can follow us in here . If it 's the same Tripod , the one that 's been following us , why hasn 't it taken us before now ? Maybe it wants to know what we 'll do or where we 'll go . So , what are we going to do ? - Lillian ? - What ? Will , is there something wrong ? There 's a ... thing in my side . I don 't know what it is . It goes into the skin as a cap does . It is the same metal . How long has it been there ? Since the Tripod took me from my horse . And you never told us ? The Tripod tracks us with this button as a hunting dog follows the scent . The Tripod caught you going from the chateau in haste , at a strange hour when everybody slept . I mean , maybe it was curious . Maybe it wanted to know what you would do or where you 'd go . So ? - What are we going to do ? - Ellie , before anything is done we must think carefully , all three of us . He 's had that thing planted in him now for days . He 's one of them now . He 's been sending them messages with his mind . - They must know everything . - Be calm , Henry . Would Will have told us that a Tripod had caught him and released him if he were now their servant ? Anyway , the button 's small . It 's not like the capping , not near the brain . If we separate and I take a different way from you two , the Tripod 'll go on following me , you 'll be all right . - A different way ? Where ? - To the White Mountains . Don 't you understand ? You 'll still lead them there . That 's what the Tripods want . Henry 's perhaps right , Will . All right , then I won 't go there . I 'll double back . - Where ? - Somewhere . - And be caught and be capped ? - I 'll take the horse . The Tripod 'll have to catch me first . The Tripod caught you before , even with your horse . The Tripod will catch you . - I can head it away , at least . - You and that girl ! You should have left the chateau with us or stayed there forever . This is bad luck , Will , no more than that . We shall think of something . Beanpole ? Look , I 'll stay in here . You and Henry can get away when it 's dark . They can 't get to me here unless they dig me out . By then you 'll be with the Free Men . - And you , Will ? - I 'll be free too , in a way . They really want to stop me , Beanpole . The way this Tripod 's been following us . Free Men must give much trouble to the Tripods . The Tripods would do a lot to find out about them . - That 's right . - HENRY : Beanpole , come here . I would prefer it if you went quite soon . Will , this thing under your arm . It is small . I don 't believe it goes far into your flesh . It 's clear of the big vein . - But it would hurt if we cut it out . - Not me . We haven 't got a knife sharp enough . - Do you think you can ? - You must make the decision . I 'm not doing anything . Anyway , that knife should be boiled or burned first . Henry , I shall be as quick as I can but you must hold Will 's arm steady for me . I can 't . I can 't do it , Beanpole . Will ... I 'm going to explore the tunnel . I 'll try and hold steady for you , Beanpole . I 'll be as quick as I can . Find something to bite on . Do you wish to study this ? Throw it away . Henry ? I found this on the way through this hill . There is a metal door at the other end . People have been there . A sort of storeroom full of bottles . And there 's a house in a valley with vines , but I didn 't see anyone . Is it far ? No . We can help you . Are you all right , Will ? Where 's the button ? We must throw that away . I 've had an idea . Very good . - Now . - Come on , boy . ( GIRL SINGING IN FRENCH ) ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) Say we 're sorry , Beanpole . Tell them we can pay for some food . Tell them we don 't mean to scare them . It would take a great deal more to scare me and my girls than three despondent young tramps and one of them injured . Please . Our friend , he 's badly hurt . I have eyes in my head . Shelagh , would you go heat the water in the outhouse ? ( RESPONDS IN FRENCH ) Kirsty , make up the big bed in your room and then carry in the mattress from the room at the inn . Make that one up also . Fiona , fetch me here the medicine box then lend a hand to Kirsty with the beds . The table , Helen . We 're late as it is . You 'll need three extra places . No ... Two extra , lay the third on a tray . Jeannie , your father at once , please . He 'll be in the vineyard . Lucy , you shall help Helen with the table . And listen , your English is in sad need of improvement . From this moment we must all speak in English . - Oui , Maman . - " Oui , Marnan , " indeed . - Yes , Maman . - " Yes , Mother . " Now set your friend here in this chair by the fire . And then the two of you must use the pump outside . Your hands and faces are a disgrace . There 'll be hot bath water after supper . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) 1 understand , madame . Et merci . Thank you . The pump , if you please . Y o u a r e blessé our ' ? " Hurt " , Lucy . " Blessé " is " hurt " . You are hurt . Yes . Papa ! Papa , viens ! Fresh water , hot food and a bed . I can 't wait . HENRY : And I 've never seen so many girls . ( GIGGLING ) ( SLURPING ) ( MONSIEUR VICHOT MUTTERS IN FRENCH ) Lucy ? Max 's I 'm taking bread to Monsieur Will . My unfortunate husband has never mastered the English tongue in spite of my best endeavours . All of my girls are , of course , bilingual . More or less . Where do you come from ? Please . Have you never heard the Scots accent before ? No . You have heard of Scotland , I suppose . ( GIRLS GIGGLE ) - In school . - Mother was a girl in Leith . Do you know Leith ? It 's in Scotland . Mother 's father was a trader with a ship . - Mother 's father ... - MADAME VICHOT : Your grandfather , dear . My grandfather brought skins and cloth to France . - And whisky . - Do you know what whisky is ? - No . - HELEN : Never mind . And he 'd sell all that and buy wine to take home to Scotland to sell there . Mother used to come to France with him when she was a girl . - Oh , not only France . - Mother 's been everywhere . More years ago than I care to recall , I met a dashing young Frenchman whose family had a small farm and winery here in urethra . - He was tall and strong . - And very handsome . Simply swept her off her feet . ( MONSIEUR VICHOT PROTESTING IN FRENCH ) Now it 's myself who does any sweeping that has to be done , eh ? ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) You 'll stay a while , I hope . Your friend here shouldn 't travel for three or four days . - And you 'll do us a favour by staying . - How , madame ? Well , not only would it improve my girls ' English , and convince them that it is a language actually spoken by real flesh and blood , but we have a grape harvest to gather . And , well , two and a half extra pairs of hands would be a great help . And of course , with the six girls to marry off and only the one of them spoken for ... Well , Vichot and I , we 're not anxious to let any good prospects slip away through our fingers . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Some more wine for me please , Fiona . ( MADAME VICHOT LAUGHING ) We 'll stay and help any way we can . ( HUMMING ) No . Like this . Perhaps there is a better way . I will find it . ( GROANING ) Do you see anything , Will ? - No . - That 's what I said . The Tripods don 't come this side of the hill . - How do you know ? - I asked Kirsty . - You asked her what ? - I asked her whether Tripods came here . Well , that was stupid . We agreed , we 've got to be careful . If they were gonna give us away they would have done so by now . Don 't you ever learn ? We can 't trust anybody . Willis right . We must show caution . Well , what did she say ? Your great friend . She said no , and she 's not my great friend . WILL : Not much . You two argued about a girl once before . It was bad then and it 's bad now . If we can trust them so perfectly , what have they done with our things ? They took everything . You saw yourself . They were washing our clothes . - And the rest ? - Those metal eggs , they were dangerous . Don 't tell me ! I know ! Tell him ! - You 're just jealous ! - I 've got nothing to be ... Please , leave this . And keep your voices quiet . What 's this ? HENRY : It 's a night shirt . It 's a dress . I do not wear a dress . I 'm too tired to care what I wear . Will you listen ? What are we going to do about the rest of the equipment they took ? Listen , I told you . ( SHUSHING ) ( BEANPOLE SPEAKING FRENCH ) We have brushed the mud away and mended the bags . There are things we 've not seen before . But we were careful . - You 're tired , Henry ? - Yes . ( BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH ) We work again early tomorrow . - Sleep well . - SHELAGH : Sleep good . - Sleep well . - SHELAGH : Sleep well . - Come . - Bonsoir . - Good night . - Good night . They 've even ironed the maps . Is everything there , Will ? - Yes . - I told you . Don 't forget the City of Gold is very close . It 's dangerous . - That 's all . - I want to say something . We 've all had a rough time . Perhaps you 've had the worst . You 've actually been caught by a Tripod . - Don 't blame me ... - Listen . I know there 's danger wherever we go , but we can trust this family . You 've seen that . We 're getting to the end of the journey now but the hardest part may still be ahead . Go on , Henry . I think we should stay here . ( EXCLAIMING ) Yes , then we can rest and be strong . And when we set out again , the Tripods would 've stopped looking for us . If we spend the winter here . - The winter ? The whole winter ? - Yes . Then we can be really fit and ready for the last part . - Beanpole ? - There is some sense in what Henry says . It 's Kirsty . That 's all he cares about . - Oh , don 't be stupid . - Deny it , then . There 'll be no more talk tonight . We 're all tired . We shall think of Henry 's suggestion , and we shall watch for danger . But first we shall get to know this family better . Then we shall talk of this subject again . ( CHUCKLING ) Yes , Grandma . ( LAUGHING ) I can see nothing of amusement . ( WILL AND HENRY LAUGHING ) At last . One is ready . - Good , Henry . Yes ? - Hmm . Come . - Come where ? - It is our task . - What is ? - Shoes , Henry . Your trousers . What ? The others will soon be here with more grapes . - What are you doing ? - Come on . ( GROANING ) Oh , it tickles . ( SINGING IN FRENCH ) Oh , you 've some colour back in your cheeks . Oh , it 's the rest and your food . Why don 't you take a walk up to the vineyard this afternoon ? I don 't doubt Lucy will give you a guided tour . - Yes , I will . Thank you . - Would you care for a bath tonight ? I think that arm of yours could stand some hot soapy water . - So could the rest of you . - Yes , please . Oh . You 'll see jeannie 's young man this evening . He 's coming over to meet you . You 'll like him . What 's the matter with you ? Nothing . The opposite . I had a big tear here . Or here . I don 't know . - Et voila ' ! - Me , too . - They 're really treating us well . - And they ask no questions . They like us . It 's good , very good . Well , at least we can help them out gathering the grapes . - Lillian ? - It 's been a good day . I have an idea for gathering the grapes off the tree . - The vine . - The vine , yes . - I shall invent a machine . - Poor grapes . Well , it 's good to have our own clothes back again , yes ? - What did you do today , Will ? - Oh ... Talked a lot with Madame Vichot , went for a walk . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) - hardhat 's that ? - It 's a sort of an organ . Monsieur Vichot makes music with it . He 's really good . - Ellie , me , I shall enjoy tonight . - Me too . Come on . What 's the trouble , Will ? - Nothing . I 'm ready , are you ? - Yes . Let 's go down , then . Maybe Henry was right . Maybe we should stay . I mean , they treat us well and like us . My arm 's probably not perfect yet . - I 'm sorry . It 's just that I ... - jeannie 's boyfriend 's coming round . - Sensationnel ! - Come on . Let 's go and enjoy ourselves . LUCY : Monsieur WI ll . ( ALL CHATTERING ) ( ALL CHATTERING ) ( MUSIC STOPS ) - It is jeannie 's fiancé . - Betrothed . We use the same word , " fiancé " . ( MUSIC STARTS AGAIN ) Yes , yes , yes . We 'll be eating in a minute . I hope you 're all very hungry . JEANNIE : This is Daniel . We 're to be married . He does not speak English . - Bonsoir . - ALL : Bonsai ) " , Daniel . ( SINGING IN FRENCH ) ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) What did he say ? He says you 're good and strong . He said you were strong , anyway . ( LAUGHING ) I know it 's already September and winter 'll soon be here , but it 's good to stop and have some fun . We deserve it . Think of all those times we passed near a town or a village and we dared not enter . Think how greatly you wished to be safe , among friends once more . Safe ? But you saw the Tripods going to the city . You hear them all the time , even here . It 's going to be hard , really hard , the last part . BEANPOLE : We shall do it . In winter . Look , I know why you both like it here . I don 't blame you . It 's just that ... Don 't blame us for Eloise , Will . HENRY : You said yourself , the winter 's coming and the last part 's going to be the toughest . We 've a good way to climb yet before we reach the White Mountains . Oh , madame . I have something to show you . Come with me . Oh , we were making up stories ... Come . MADAME VICHOT : I have travelled . Before I was your age , I had seen six countries . I started to make a collection , to remind me of other times , other places . I 've never seen such things . I 'm grateful to a father who taught me my jackdaw ways , because it means I 've been able to show my children some of the wonders I was fortunate enough to see . Some things , unfortunately , I 've not been able to show . From that strange box and those black plates , there came music once . ( ALL EXCLAIMING ) But not everything survived our long journeys . That 's amazing . Why do you show us all this ? And how ? If you 've been ... Look , I ... I think we should make ourselves comfortable . How and why ? You know , I often wonder . You see , I 'm some kind of vagrant ... Huh ? ... whose capping finally contented me with life in this quiet heart of France , a gentle husband and our six daughters . But it never completely quenched my instinct for learning or my curiosity . And you may use this room whenever you wish . Thank you . Merci , madame . But I have a question now . Jean-Paul here is French , but he 's many kilometres from home . And you , Henry and Will , now , what reason would you have for crossing a sea and a foreign land to invade our vineyard ? Oh , I 've been honest with you . You know why . Well , you must have heard us in our room . We 're trying to get to the White Mountains , Madam Vichot . If by that you mean what we call the Alps , for they are indeed white mountains , do you not know that they cover a great distance ? That they stretch across four countries ? France , Switzerland , Italy and Austria . Did you not know that ? No . Do you perhaps mean [ e Mont Blanc ? Le Mont Blanc ? " The white mountain " ! MADAME VICHOT - Mmm-hmm . And it is ... It 's here . Of course , I remember now ! It was what Ozymandias had said to me , the White Mountain . ( SINGING IN FRENCH ) ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) It 's like running 20 kilometres . When your journey is over and done , whatever it is , would you not come back ? We all hoped you 'd stay for the winter . It 's a hard time . Extra hands would be welcome . And we 'd be together . Kirsty , would you believe I 've never been so happy ? What is so important that it takes you away , then ? Kirsty . Mother told us to ask no questions . When shall you go ? Kirsty , if you didn 't want ... I mean ... If you really don 't want to be apart from me , and I don 't want to leave you , but ... Perhaps if Beanpole and Will agree , do you ... You 've seen how we are , Henry . I love my home , and I 'm needed here . ( GONG RINGING ) I 'm hungry . ( ALL CHATTERING ) ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) What does he want ? Answers . What 's he going to ask ? How should I know ? ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) Oh , for some inscrutable reason , Daniel finds it unbelievable that you don 't travel weighed down by a hundredweight of official forms . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) ( BIDDING FAREWELL IN FRENCH ) Well , I expect you understood most of that . I didn 't . Oh , we have no license to travel , no license to stay . And you and I should be registered as foreign visitors . Daniel can 't imagine how your legs 'll function without the papers . We should go . We don 't want to cause any trouble for you . Oh , Daniel 's no trouble , Will . He 'd half expect unexplained young travelers to turn up at the vineyard of a foreign eccentric like myself . But Daniel has superiors . He 's bringing more forms for us to sign the day after tomorrow . But tomorrow we finish the grape-picking , and nothing 's going to spoil that , eh ? We 've got to leave . I can 't explain , Helen . We must leave . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) You can change your mind , you know . You wish to make a grand journey before you 're capped . I understand . My mother tells us it was so with her . But when your plan is achieved , you will return to us on your way home , yes ? I know it will be so . We have little time now . Oui . Then let us lose none . Don 't you like me , Will ? Of course I do . I like you all . I wish you would not go away when the grapes are picked . Do you think I 'm pretty , Will ? Prettier than any other girl in France ? ( MADAME VICHOT SPEAKING FRENCH ) ( SHELAGH SOBBING ) Are you perhaps homesick or missing somebody ? I 'm famous in this family for keeping secrets . A girl I , uh , met . What would her name be ? Eloise . What happened ? Eloise had a family , too , a good family and home . They wanted me to stay . What happened ? She was taken to serve the Tripods . - In their city ? - Yes . I know , it 's the greatest honour , and I 'm not capped so I don 't understand . Very well . If you 've been in love , you 'll know that love can hurt , yes ? So how do you think my poor Shelagh feels , huh ? Have you no eyes in your head ? She dotes on you , man . I know , and I 'm sorry . I just can 't help it . It 's not undying love they 're asking . It 's just a little consideration and kindness . But because you 've been hurt , you throw it all back in their faces . Now , is this how your Eloise would have wanted you to behave ? No . Will , you remember the works of art I showed you in the attic ? We talk of loving , but there are two loves , the love for one person and the love for mankind . Without the one , the other is nothing . The one is private and tender , but the other links us to the world itself . All of those wonders were made with love . Love should build up , not destroy . With love and courage , mankind is capable of anything . Madame Vichot , you ... You told us you were capped . Well , so I am . I 've already told you that I am perhaps some kind of vagrant whose capping never wholly succeeded . Sometimes I dream , Will . I dream of that time before the Tripods , when men and women were masters of their fate . And then there are regrets . I come and I look at my treasures . Oh , that mankind could have made such things . But we live in the real world , and the real world is a world of capping and acceptance . My girls will be capped . Jeannie is already . They will lose their sense of wonder . But there will be gains . Peace of mind . Do not underestimate the gift of peace of mind , Will . I shall never have that entirely . ( ACCORDION PLAYING ) ( ALL CHEERING ) ( SIGHING ) ( ALL CHATTING ) Helen 's made a cake . ( ALL CHEERING ) ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) ( MUSIC PLAYING ) - Beanpole can mend anything . - He 's a genius ! So 's Helen . ( LAUGHING ) - Monsieur Henry Parker . - Merci . - Monsieur Will Parker . - Merci . - Et Monsieur jean-Paul Deliet . - Merci . All men must take their separate ways . And though these partings grieve us , the memory of your friendship stays , and this will never leave us . We wish you joy , we wish you health , pray in your hearts receive us . Good fellowship is more than wealth , and that will never leave us . Hey , that looks really good , really warm . It is , yeah . Hey , look . Someone 's given me new boots . Me , too ! And this . It 's the route to Mont Blanc . Come on . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) Au revoir , Will . Thank you . - Good-bye , WI ll . - Thank you . Safe journey . - Take care . - You , too . Thank you for your help . Thank you for everything . I hope you find what you 're looking for . I think you should go now . My husband will set you on your way . Good luck . Safe traveling . Remember us . There is no choice . We must cross the water . - Why isn 't there a bridge ? - You 're getting soft . I 'm getting tired . Tired of walking . - walking and walking and walking ... - There is no bridge . - How far have we come ? - This morning . Ten kilometres , maybe 12 . I wish we still had that cart . - Not as easy as it looks . - That is true . Where shall we cross ? If we follow the river a bit , it should be easier downstream . We 'll need to get some more food . I 'm starving . - You 're never anything else . - I 'm getting thin . We 'll need to stock up as soon as we can . Henry 's right . The closer we get to the White Mountain , the harder it will be to find food . Come on . Hurry UP - I 'm going blue . Come on , then , Beanpole . You 'll be sorry . Your clothes will get soaked . Come on , Beanpole , I can 't stand much more of this . ( LAUGHING ) - There 's nothing funny I can see . - Oh , no , Beanpole . - Of course not , Beanpole . - Excellent drying wind . - It has made me very hungry . - Me , too . And we 've no food . BEANPOLE : This bridge , Fest magnifique , eh ? WILL : For the them DE fer ? BEANPOLE : I think so , yes . WILL : Our ancestors were great builders . BEANPOLE : Everywhere we see their works . One day , perhaps ... One day we shall build like them again . Where do you think we are now ? Well ? - I cannot say . - There must be a village soon . - We need food . - This map shows only the big towns . There is not one near . Well , I say we stop at the next village we come to . Never mind the risk , ask for something to eat . - Ellie , Beanpole ? - I agree . We badly need food . - Ellie , I don 't like it . - We 've seen no Tripods . Run for it . No . We are seen . Stay calm . Whoa . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) Say nothing . ( BELL TOLLING ) - Hey , listen . - I don 't like the sound of that bell . At home they used to ring the bell like that , on capping day . Come on , let 's get off . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) ( GREETING IN FRENCH ) Whoa . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) - Is it safe ? - We have no choice . Say nothing . - Some sort of festival ? - Look at all that food . What 's happening over there ? Come on . I think they pay their taxes . Something like that . Well , nobody 's taking much notice of us . That 's one good thing . We don 't look a lot different from them . Will , if you must speak , it will be in French . - Yeah . - And , Henry , you must stay silent . Don 't worry about that . If someone asks us , we 're travelers , come to visit their féte . - Festival ? - Yes . - It 's too risky . - Yes , but we need food . You 're both right . Wait here . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) This way . ( DOG BARKING ) Beanpole . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) ( DOG BARKING ) ( VILLAGERS SHOUTING ) This way . They 're not coming in . Are you all right , Beanpole ? We 'd better get further in . Come on . Let 's go . ( VAGRANTS SNARLING ) Vagrants ! ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) ( SHOUTING IN FRENCH ) Are you all right ? They 're quite mad . I 've never seen people like this . We must think carefully how to escape . ( GASPING ) - Henry , can you run ? - I don 't know . I think so . The longer we 're here , the more dangerous it becomes . If we don 't make it the first time we 're going to be in trouble . We 're in trouble now . We have our brains , our wits . These people do not . When we go , we shall go between the shelter and the fire . The way we came . - How will we know when ? - I will say . First we must perform like they do . Do as I do . ( GRUNTING ) ( GRUNTING ) My name is Ozymandias . I am king of kings , look at my words . I 'll despair , despair , despair , despair ! Despair , despair , despair ! ( GROANS ) ( ALL MOANING ) Now , slowly , the way we came . Henry ? ( CLUCKING ) ( GRUNTING ) - What does he want ? - I do not know . Now . ( SHOUTING ) ( BARKING ) ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) ( BELL TOLLING ) 5 ' i ! vous plait " t . M Eric . 5 ' i ! vous pita " t . M Eric . 5 ' i ! vous pita " t . M Eric . ( WHISPERING IN FRENCH ) You should eat . You wish I speak in English , which all three boys can understand ? If you wish to prefer , I speak in French . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) English , if you please , monsieur . We have talked much of you . It is very good that you speak only the truth . It is not usually what you say . And the gentlemen do not remember such travelers all their lives . You see , you 'll be famous . The English boys who meet the French boy to travel and adventure , and come here to our small village on our day of feast . - We have talked much . - What will happen , please ? When there is no cap in the head , no capping , then the thought in the head is strange , of travel and adventure , and this is no crime . We are civilised . But civilised people do not steal . Stealing is a great crime . Besides , our festival is spoilt . There is much anger in the village . But there 's been punishment already . I think so . Wise men go not into the forest , to the ... ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) I do not know the word . - Vagabonds , vagrants . - I think so , yes . - But what will happen ? - Tomorrow , you must come for trial . It is our law , and the people wish it . Everything will be well done . There will be speaking for you , as well as against . If you are found in fault , you will be put in the cap . You are all very old to be without capping . When ? When will we be capped ? If you are in fault , tomorrow . ( BELL TOLLING ) If they send for a Tripod , when do you think it would get here ? Must be soon . We cannot be far from the Tripod city . And when it arrives , we 're as good as capped . We can 't fight a whole village as well . Oh , be calm . We 've been in such danger before . Never like this . - If we 're capped ... - We 're not capped yet . No , but if we are , will the Tripods know everything ? About the Free Men , Ozymandias and ... well , everything ? And we 're so close to the White Mountain . We must keep to the story we agreed . Boys , here is Monsieur Dubois . He will speak in your behalf . I present also Monsieur Neyrand . Monsieur Neyrand will speak for the village . We are chosen for we speak English a little . - To the leader , the ... - The mayor . - The mayor and [ as Ann / ens ? - The council . To them there will be translation in our language . You see , boys , we do everything well . Monsieur , if a Tripod has been sent for , and you say we are of the age for capping , then what is the point in such a trial ? It is our custom . A wrong has been done . A decision must be taken so all is made well . ( BANGING GAVEL ) ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) Well , we had been traveling for a long time . We wanted to see many other lands and customs before we were capped . In England and in parts of France , where my cousin and I met jean-Paul , young people are capped only when they 've made a journey and visited other places . Three days ago , we heard about your festival and decided to come here . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) ( DOOR OPENING ) - Daniel . - hardhat 's he doing here ? I don 't know . ( WHISPERING ) ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) Come , boys . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) You have not told us the truth . You are subversives . My colleague tells me he has followed you in the hope of discovering your contacts . Only your arrest here has prevented him . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) My colleague tells me a good family gave you shelter , and you betrayed their trust . He insists you return to his headquarters for questioning by his superiors . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) It is agreed . The custom of capping so late , if what you say is true , is wrong . That much is clear . You were misguided . When you 're capped , you 'll understand . Talk to him , Beanpole . Ask him if all this is true . Hey , Daniel . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) It 's no use . I reminded him that we were friends . He must have known all the time about the White Mountain . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) This is all my fault . Now 's our chance . I could perhaps reach him . My arms are Long . You couldn 't hold him if he struggled . - He 'd do that , all right . - Mmm . Anyway , he 's our friend . We can 't just go and ... Henry , that belt that Kirsty made for you . - Yes ? - Take it off , slowly . Around his neck . If I can pull him back . He 's jeannie 's boyfriend . They 're going to get married . It 's him or us . One of you must use this belt . Go on , go on ! ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) Henry . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) ( GRUNTING ) Come , Henry . Come on . - Two more days only . - Hmm ? I think in two more days , we will discover the Free Men . - Let 's hope so . - And if we don 't ? What do you mean ? Well , in two more days , it could just turn out to be a wild goose chase . - Goose chase ? - He means a waste of time . Oh , no . Never . For my part , I 've learned much . Do you think Ozymandias just travelled to England for fun ? There must have been thousands of uncapped boys living closer to the White Mountain . Why go to England in the first place ? Why choose us ? I don 't know . The Tripods know where we 're going and why , - and they don 't like it . - Maybe . Look , the Free Men exist , all right . Hundreds of them , probably thousands . There 'll be men and women and young people like us from all parts of Europe , with different ways and languages . They 'll be organised , with plans to fight the Tripods , maybe even weapons . But not one of them will be capped . That we 'll all have in common . For me , it will be an exciting moment meeting them . And for me . For me , too . If it ever happens . Anything ? HENRY : Nothing . This way . This place is creepy . I hate the cold . How do we get out of this ? Through there . - You all right ? - Yes . Come on . Let 's go . - Are you sure ? - Yes . Don 't fuss . Hey , look . Rails . Lines of iron . - A them DE fer . - just like you wanted . Oh , well , not exactly . Hey , look . Come on , Beanpole . Get on . Come on . Come on . Faster . Come on . ( EXCLAIMING ) ( LAUGHING ) Oh , no . Shut up . We 'll have to wait . - How long ? - One hour . We will wait one hour . If it hasn 't moved then , we shall make a plan . Henry . I think we should wait more . Well , how long ? I 'm freezing . I don 't know . Until it goes away . It could be days . Will ? I don 't know . Maybe we could get past it , along the gully . No , that 's too dangerous . What do you think , Beanpole ? I think we can destruct it . - You mean destroy it ? - Destroy it . Yes . I have made a plan . First we must find out if it is alone . One of us must climb out to look out of the gully . Like a fat man , the Tripod cannot see his feet . HENRY : Go on , Beanpole . Pull . HENRY : Pull . Three , four , five , six . - Yeah ! - Yeah ! ( WILL AND HENRY CHEERING ) - Yeah ! - We did it ! Come on , come on ! Quickly ! Will , Henry , we must leave now . The others may have heard the signal . Leave everything . There 's no time . Come on ! You 've killed it , Henry . It 's dead , you 've killed it . Yes ! Will . Will , I think I saw something in the Tripod . - A face ? - Yes . They carry people . ( TRIPOD TRUMPETING ) They 're not coming . Yet . I think they go to the destructed Tripod . We killed one . Well , you did , Henry . You saved us , Henry . Yes . I suppose I did . WILL : Let 's go . BEANPOLE : Yes . They 'll find the destructed Tripod . That will make them more dangerous . - Which way ? - There 's only one way now . - The White Mountain . - We need no map . Come on . We should have taken our things when we killed the Tripod . There was no time . - What is it ? - Tripod . Wake Will . WI ll . WI ll , Tripod . ( TRIPOD TRUMPETING ) - No , stay here . - They can see us in here . At least here we have some shelter . He 's right , Will . We must try at staying put . ( SCREAMING ) Gone . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) What 's he saying ? There are no Free Men . - What ? - It 's a fable , a fairy story . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) Be ready . There might be a chance . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) Yes . I think two English , and one French . It is not important . But who are you ? Why are you here ? Three replies are possible . You come by accident , you are sent by Tripods , or you are sent for a reason that only you know . Speak , you . You ? I think you 're sent . But who sends you ? Tripods ? That is good . There is a small group of bandits and vagrants in the mountains . Some believe them to be Free Men . The Tripods send false recruits to join them and to discover their plans . You are of these ? It is not unknown for Tripods to take away memory of being conditioned in this way . Whatever the truth , we shall discover it . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) If you wish to speak to us , call through the door . I 'll not trust any of them . Bandits ! Do you think they meant the Free Men ? There aren 't any Free Men . You heard what he said . - They only call them bandits ... - Grow up , Will . It 's over . It 's a long way to come to be capped . He said there were three possible replies we could give him , yes ? I think we should give him one , perhaps . - What ? - The old story . The one about our adventure before capping . It succeed ed before . In England , it is a custom to undertake a journey . An adventure . - The greater the journey ... - The more our families are pleased . We heard of great mountains in the south . Jean-Paul told us . They 've never seen such mountains . There are none in England . Now we 've seen them . And we 're going to start for home again , tomorrow . You will speak all of this adventure . Now . Well , it began in Wharton , where I was born . My friend jack , jack was going to be capped ... We hid on the boat . There were other boys there . They weren 't capped , either . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) Beanpole called it a them DE fer . It was a machine . A steam machine , to pull carts . I don 't know how many lived there , at the time . There must have been 200 . In October we picked grapes , and made wine in urethra . And when I caught them up , I found this button placed under my arm . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) The Tripods attacked us . Then you found us in the rocks . That 's all . Hey ! I see nothing . I see nothing . We must know three things . Where , precisely , where was the Tripod which gave the button ? Precisely what were the instructions you were given ? I don 't know . I can 't remember . And about what you call the Free Men . What was the information ... - I don 't know . - ... you went to collect ? Think , think hard , and you may see your Eloise again . That would be worth a little thought , yes ? Believe me , such things can be arranged . You must take this . I 'm sorry . In your answers , I hear you say you helped make wine . The other side of the lake ? The best wine of France , I think . You know that part of France ? - I 'm of that part . - The Jura ? Do you not also know that when the cap is put in place , often blindness or deafness are cured at once ? - I do not believe it . - You do not wish to believe it . A stubborn mind prefers its fantasies . Why should I believe anything you say ? Why should I even believe you 're Black Guards ? You demand the truth from me . Why should I believe you ? ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) I 'll only answer one question . The question will decide ... Are there Free Men in these mountains ? Men who come together to fight the Tripods ? Why should men fight Tripods ? The Tripods are our friends . There are bandits , yes , and vagrants . I do not understand the question . How can I answer ? You are of no importance , you simply waste our time . We know you were not sent by Tripods , so you lie because you 're afraid . Well , others have babbled of Free Men , of safe ships across the sea , of help and assistance during a journey . To you , I offer this . If you tell what you know , this girl , this Eloise who serves the Tripods , she can be found . She is capped , of course , but so will you be , soon . You can live together . You can return to the chateau . If not , this picture shall be given to the Tripods . I promise you will see your Eloise again . But dead or alive , that is your choice . To you , I offer these snuffles . Without them , you can see little . A man who sees little is useless and his life is short . If you tell nothing , the Tripods will make you a vagrant . A man who makes such as these would be totally wasted with a destroyed brain . Now , you can be of use . You will be capped . The capping will be successful . You will be one of us , a Guard . In that way you can serve your fellow man . The telling will begin now . There will be food , drink and sleep when it is finished . Vagrant ? What vagrant ? You come this way , all this way , on the word of a vagrant ? Stupid ! You 're a stupid country boy . Your fool of a cousin tells you to leave home and you obey . You meet a French boy you have never seen before and you take his word . Like this vagrant . What 's his name ? - His name . - Oz . - Ozymandias . - Ozymandias . Always the stupid fellow . Afraid of capping . Afraid of Black Guards . Young , afraid , and a coward . Yes , coward . Daniel Montagnon . Three of you , against a young man who was once your friend . Stupid , useless and a coward . I 'm not ! I killed a Tripod . Me ! Nobody else . Me ! And I 'll do it again , and again , and again , and again , and again . - The destruction of the Tripod ... - It was my idea . They had been following us for weeks . We are happy to know it is smashed . There is one gap , in jura . - You were there several days ... - Urethra is large . Your Tripod masters cannot kill everyone there . - You were helped ! - Even if they are aided by filth like you . You will regret your words . It is probable . Where did you learn to speak French ? - At the chateau . - Why ? They wanted me to stay and marry Eloise . That 's ridiculous . Stupid country boy , not even of their nation ? - Where is the chateau ? - I 've told you . Tell me again . It is not exact . We shall not find it . Leave them alone . Don 't find them . They gave you shelter . They gave you help . They liked me . Don 't you understand ? They just liked me . So you stole a horse , clothes , food , maps ? It wasn 't like that . Which chateau ? Which count ? I said leave them alone . They didn 't know . Know what ? That I was coming here to join the ... Free Men . At last , we have it . Others like us will still come . - Why ? - To rid the world of Tripods . You may have us , but others will still come ! Hundreds , thousands , as many as it takes . You tried to make us betray the Free Men , then you 've as good as told us they exist . Why all this if they don 't ? But it 's you that betray . You betray all people by serving the Tripods . Things will change . You wait and see . They will . You will never get what you want from me . Never ! I will never be capped . Never ! It 'll take the four of you to get me to that Tripod ! I believe it . Well done . Ozymandias ! " Will Parker is hot-headed and impetuous . " That 's what the report says . I saw you killed . You saw me act unconscious . I told you it 'd be difficult . Will ? Will ? - Henry , it 's Ozymandias . - How ? " My name is Ozymandias , King of Kings . " Look on my works , ye mighty . And rejoice . " This is the man we told you about , in England , Ozymandias . Give jean-Paul back his glasses . But I don 't understand . I mean , how are you here ? That 's what I want to know . Well , your Black Guards , like our good friend here Monsieur Cabot , are all , in fact , Free Men . We 've come very close to being infiltrated by boys who 've been conditioned by the Tripods . We had to make absolutely sure . That 's why we had to have you interrogated . But now , have you energy enough for breakfast ? Chemin DE fer . - What ? { hem / n DE fer . Yes , railway . Come on , boys . Sensationnel ! How is it done ? It 's called electricity . It also lights the lamps . Our leader 's name is Julius . My friends , we welcome today three new members to our community . Henry and Will Parker , from England . Henry . And William . And jean-Paul Deliet . Make them truly welcome . We all know the dangers and hardships they have overcome to reach us . ( ALL APPLAUDING ) Young men , young women , I know that you must often wonder at your life in the White Mountain . You came here at great risk to destroy the Tripods . And all we teach you are skills which must seem to you irrelevant . Instead of combat , we coach you to a high level of achievement at certain sports . And you must wonder why . ( GASPING ) This is a rough model of the city of the Tripods . The City of Gold . This city lies a week 's journey to the north . And within the year , some of you will enter it . Each year , in the annual games held nearby , young people are chosen to serve the Tripods in their city . Some are chosen for their beauty , others for their strength and speed . We believe that within this city only the young and strong can survive . Does your daily sports routine now make sense ? We shall send competitors to the next games highly trained , in the hope that they may be selected to serve the Tripods in their city . They must gather the information we so badly need in order to destroy these monstrous hives of cruelty and domination . We elders cannot do this . It is upon a handful of you here today that man 's freedom now depends . It 's a heavy task we lay on you . We dare to hope that you may be successful . One of the rights of free-thinking , uncapped humans is freedom of choice . I ask you to exercise that right now . Stand if you are willing to be selected for the next annual games , and entry into the Tripods ' city .

Ed . - What have you got ? - Dead girl . 35 . Shot six times at less than 10 feet . Large calibre weapon . these work . - What 's this ? - Dead girl two . Sent over from the Valley division this afternoon . Are you sure there 's a point to all of this ? Ed . Sarah Louise Connor . Is this right ? You 're kidding . The press is gonna be short-stroking it . - A one-day pattern killer . - I hate the weird ones . So ... Better than mortal man deserves . have you seen Pugsley ? - Not lately . Did you check messages ? I thought you did . young man . You mind your mother . Sarah . Stan Morsky . Something 's come up . Looks like I won 't be able to make it tonight . Just can 't get out of it . I 'm really sorry . I 'll make it up to you . Call you in a day or so . Bye . That bum . So what if he has a Porsche ? for Christ 's sake . I 'll live . I 'll break his kneecaps . baby ? God . It 's disgusting . kiddo . Have a good time . too . - OK . Matt . Shit . These killings occurred in the order of their listings in the phone book . Lieutenant ... That coffee 's two hours cold . I put a cigarette out in it . - Did you reach the next girl yet ? - No . I got her answering machine . - Send a unit . - I sent a unit . There 's no answer . - The apartment manager 's not in . - Call her . - I just called her . - Call her again . Give me a cigarette . there . Fooled you . You 're talking to a machine . so talk to it ... Same shit . he 's gonna be called the goddamn Phone Book Killer . I hate these press cases . Especially the weird press cases . - Where are you going ? - To make a statement . Maybe make these jackals work for us . maybe she 'll call us . how do I look ? boss . - Your mama . This just in . Police have announced the name of the victim in the second of two murders which took place today . the names of the two victims are virtually identical . 35-year-old Sarah Ann Connor was pronounced dead ... - Can we change this ? - Sarah Louise ... Don 't touch it . Police are refusing to speculate on the similarity between the shooting deaths and no other connection between the two victims has been established yet . We 'll have more on this late-breaking story as it comes in . you got a phone ? - It 's in the back . Hey . Four-fifty . You have reached the Los Angeles Police emergency number . stay on the line . Go on . I 'm gonna make a belt out of you . man . there . Fooled you . You 're talking to a machine . too . or Sarah will get back to you . Wait for the beep . This is Sarah . Pick up if you 're there . I 'm at this place on Pico Boulevard called Tech Noir . I 'm really scared . I think that there 's somebody after me . I hope that you play this back soon . I need you and Matt to come and pick me up as soon as possible . The police keep transferring me . I 'm gonna give ' em another try . kiddo . I need your help . It 's her . Sarah Connor ? It 's Lieutenant Traxler . Don 't put me on hold . Don 't transfer me to another department . I won 't . Can you tell me where you are ? - I 'm in this bar called Tech Noir . - I know it . It 's on Pico . but I don 't wanna leave . listen carefully . You 're in a public place so you 'll be safe . Stay visible . Don 't go outside . - I 'll have a car there in a minute . - OK . that guy didn 't pay . Come with me if you wanna live . Come on ! This is one-L-19 . I got a hit-and-run felony . Suspect vehicle - late model grey Ford headed westbound on Seven . He 's really moving - punching lights . I 'm gonna need an ambulance at Seventh and Broadway right now . Hold it . Hold on . Are you injured ? Are you shot ? Do exactly what I say . Exactly . Don 't move unless I say . Don 't make a sound unless I say . Do you understand ? - Do you understand ? - Yes . Please don 't hurt me . I 'm here to help you . I 'm Reese . Sergeant Tech-Com . DN38 416 . Assigned to protect you . You 've been targeted for termination . This is one-L-19 . Westbound on Olympic . Approaching Overland . This is a mistake . I didn 't do anything . but you will . It 's very important that you live . This isn 't true . How could that man just get up after you ... It 's not a man . A machine . A Terminator . Cyberdyne Systems model 101 . A machine ? Like a robot ? Not a robot . A cyborg - cybernetic organism . - No . He was bleeding . - Just a second . Get your head down . part machine . Underneath it 's a hyper-alloy combat chassis . Microprocessor controlled . very tough . Outside it 's living human tissue . blood - grown for the cyborgs . I don 't know ... - Pay attention . I gotta ditch this car . The 600-Series had rubber skin . We spotted them easy . But these are new . They look human . everything . Very hard to spot . I had to wait till he moved on you before I could zero him . Look . I am not stupid . They cannot make things like that yet . Not yet . Not for about forty years . Are you saying it 's from the future ? One possible future ... from your point of view . I don 't know tech stuff . too . Is that right ? - Right . - Right . Cyborgs don 't feel pain . I do . Don 't do that again . - Just let me go . - Listen and understand . That Terminator is out there . it can 't be reasoned with . It doesn 't feel pity or remorse or fear until you are dead . Can you stop it ? I don 't know . With these weapons . I don 't know . All units . Ford suspect vehicle has been found in a parking structure ... why me ? Why does it want me ? There was a nuclear war . A few years from now . everything . just gone . There were survivors . there . Nobody even knew who started it . Sarah . - I don 't understand . Defence network computers . trusted to run it all . They say it got smart - a new order of intelligence . Then it saw all people as a threat . Not just the ones on the other side . It decided our fate in a microsecond . Extermination . Did you see this war ? No . I grew up after . In the ruins . hiding from the H-Ks . - H-Ks ? - Hunter-killers . Patrol machines built in automated factories . Most of us were rounded up . Put in camps for orderly disposal . This was burned in by laser scanner . Some of us were kept alive . To work . Loading bodies . The disposal units ran night and day . We were that close to going out for ever . But there was one man who taught us to fight . To storm the wire of the camps . To smash those metal motherfuckers into junk . He turned it around . He brought us back from the brink . His name was Connor . John Connor . Sarah . Your unborn son . Drive . Reese ! no . They 'll kill you . You in the Cadillac . let me see your hands now . Get out of the car . Drop to your knees . - Out of the car . - Drop to the ground . try to drink some of this . are you sure it 's them ? maybe I should look at the bodies . No . They 've been identified and there 's no doubt . Ginger . Kiddo . Sarah . Tell him everything Reese told you . Sarah . Do you feel up to that ? Yeah . I guess so . - You 're a doctor ? - Criminal psychologist . - Is Reese crazy ? - That 's what we 're gonna find out . So you 're a soldier . Fighting for whom ? With the 132nd under Perry . From ' 21 to ' 27 . That 's the year 2027 ? That 's right . Then I was assigned ... - This is fucking great . - ... under John Connor . - Who was the enemy ? - A computer defence system ... Goddamn ! Sorry . ... built for SAC-NORAD by Cyberdyne Systems . I see . And this computer thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy . before he 's even conceived . A sort of retroactive abortion ? a guy burned his Afghan . shut up . Why didn 't the computer just kill Connor then ? Why this elaborate scheme with the Terminator ? It had no choice . Their defence grid was smashed . We 'd won . Taking out Connor then would make no difference . Skynet had to wipe out his entire existence . Is that when you captured the lab complex and found ... What is it called ? The time displacement equipment ? That 's right . The Terminator had already gone through . Connor sent me to intercept and they blew the whole place . how are you supposed to get back ? I can 't . Nobody goes home . Nobody else comes through . It 's just him and me . It 's just him and me . Why didn 't you bring any weapons ? Something more advanced . Don 't you have ray guns ? - Ray guns . - Show me a piece of future technology . You go naked . Something about the field generated by a living organism . Nothing dead will go . I didn 't build the fucking thing . if it 's metal ... ? right . I could make a career out of this guy . See how clever it is ? It doesn 't require a shred of proof . but this is brilliant . - Why were the other women killed ? - Records were lost in the war . Skynet knew almost nothing about Connor 's mother . where she lived . They just knew the city . The Terminator was just being systematic . you have heard enough . I have answered your questions . I have to see Sarah Connor . - I 'm afraid that 's not up to me . - Then why am I talking to you ? - Who is in authority here ? - Please ... Shut up ! do you ? He 'll find her . That 's what he does . That 's all he does . he 'll reach down her throat and pull her fucking heart out ! - Doc . - Let go of me ! Sorry . He 's crazy ? he 's a loon . this is what they call body armour . Our TAC guys wear these . It 'll stop a 12-gauge round . This other man must 've been wearing one under his coat . Feel that . - He punched through the windshield . - He was probably on PCP . Broke every bone in his hand . He wouldn 't feel it . There was this guy once ... You see this scar ? Thank you . There 's a couch in this other room . Stretch out and get some sleep . Be at least an hour before your mother gets here . - I can 't sleep . - Try . but that couch is very comfortable . You 'll be perfectly safe . We got 30 cops in this building . Thank you . - Good night . - Good night . I 'm a friend of Sarah Connor . I was told she 's here . Could I see her ? can 't see her . She 's making a statement . Where is she ? It make take a while . If you wanna wait . there 's a bench over there . I 'll be back . Stay here . Watch him . Ed ... Sarah ! Reese . This way . KFLB news time . 4.36 . Top story - the largest single law enforcement mobilisation in California history is currently underway . Police in five counties are engaged in a massive manhunt for ... Take this . All right . Let 's get this off the road . - You cold ? - Freezing . Reese ? - You got a first name ? - Kyle . what 's it like when you go through time ? White light . Pain . - It 's like being born maybe . - My God . I caught one back there . - You mean you got shot ? - It 's not bad . forget it . forget it ? Are you crazy ? Take this off . Jesus . See ? It passed right through the meat . This is gonna make me puke . - Would you just talk about something ? - What ? just talk . Tell me about my son . He 's about my height . He has your eyes . What 's he like ? he 's got a strength . I 'd die for John Connor . at least now I know what to name him . Don 't suppose you know who the father is so I won 't tell him to get lost ? John never said much about him . - I know he dies before the war ... - Wait . I don 't wanna know . So was it John that sent you here ? I volunteered . - Why ? - It was a chance to meet the legend . organise . prepare from when he was a kid . When you were in hiding before the war . You 're talking about things I haven 't done yet in the past tense . It 's driving me crazy . Are you sure you have the right person ? I 'm sure . Come on ! Do I look like the mother of the future ? am I tough ? Organised ? I can 't even balance my chequebook . Reese . I didn 't ask for this honour and I don 't want it . Any of it . made me memorise it . for your courage through the dark years . I can 't help you with what you must soon face . The future is not set . You must be stronger than you imagine you can be . You must survive or I will never exist . That 's all . It 's a good field dressing . You like it ? It 's my first . it 'll be light soon . OK . Talk to me some more . About what ? Tell me about where you 're from . All right . but at night you can move around . You still have to be careful because the H-Ks use infrared . John taught us ways to dust them . That 's when the infiltrators started to appear . The Terminators were the newest . The worst . Traversing your sector in search mode 750 metres north of your position . Let 's go . DN384 ... - Right . Let him in . Terminator ! I was dreaming about dogs . We use 'em to spot Terminators . Your world is pretty terrifying . you got a dead cat in there or what ? asshole . God damn . Thank you . Is this enough ? it 's enough . I don 't wanna ask where you got it . - I 'm coming . - We need a room . - With a kitchen . - Do you have one with a kitchen ? I am dying for a shower . too . Later . I 'm going out for supplies . Keep this . Mom . I was told not to say . I need to know where to reach you . I am worried sick here . here 's the number . - You ready ? - Yes . Go ahead . It 's 4 085 551 439 . Room nine . - Got it ? - I 've got it . I gotta go . I 'm sorry I can 't tell you more right now . Mom . sweetheart . - Tiki Motel . - Give me your address there . What have we got ? corn syrup ... ammonia . What 's for dinner ? - Plastique . - That sounds good . What is it ? It 's a nitroglycerin base . It 's a bit more stable . I learned to make it when I was a kid . Make sure there 's none on the threads . Like this . Screw the end cap on . Very gently . You must 've had a fun childhood . That 's good . All right . Six more like that and I 'll get started on the fuses . won 't he ? Probably . will it ? I 'm shaking . Some legend . You must be pretty disappointed . I 'm not . what are they like ? Good fighters . That 's not what I meant . Was there someone special ? Someone ... ? you know . No . Never . Never ? I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . So much pain . You just disconnect it . So you feel nothing ? John Connor gave me a picture of you once . I didn 't know why at the time . faded . You were young like you are now . You seemed just a little sad . I used to always wonder what you were thinking at that moment . every curve . Sarah . I love you . I always have . I shouldn 't have said that . Think fast . Trade places . Faster . Drive faster . my God . You stay here . Let 's get outta here . Get out . come on . Get up . Come on . Help me . Get out . Get out . Don 't stop . Run . Sarah . Kyle . Kyle . We got him . No . Wait . What are you doing ? so he can 't track us . Come on . Kyle . Come on . - Come on . - Leave me here . soldier . On your feet . Move it . Get back . Go back . Sarah . - No . Run . Run . motherfucker . No . fucker . Kyle . November 10 . Where was I ? What 's difficult is trying to decide what to tell you and what not to . But I guess I have a while before you 're old enough to understand these tapes . They 're more for me at this point just so that I can get it straight . Fill her up . Should I tell you about your father ? that 's a tough one . knowing that he is your father ? you can never be . a person could go crazy thinking about this . I suppose I will tell you . I owe him that . Maybe it 'll help if ... we loved a lifetime 's worth . - What did he just say ? - He says you 're very beautiful . He is ashamed to ask you for five dollars for this picture . his father will beat him . kid . What did he just say ? He said there 's a storm coming in . I know .

 ( intense music ) ( rumbling ) ( gasps ) Electronic voice : Late for repair appointment . Calhoun Information Systems . Please respond . Repeat . Late for repair appointment . Please respond . - ( whirring ) - Thanks , Cal . ( sighs ) ( clicking in background ) The trouble 's in the CPU . We had two others out this week . They leave , it all goes on the blink . I got clients waiting for media quotes , schedules , it all costs money . Cal : Vent . C-H-N . Man : How does the world ever get along without computers ? It won 't be long , Mr. Cahane . Great . They told me you were Xyrex 's ace troubleshooter . Oh , yeah ? Yeah , this isn 't going to take long at all . Oh , thanks , Paul . Hey , listen , I understand you did quite a number over at Winnebe-Cahane today . Yeah , it was nothing . Nothing ? ( chuckles ) God , I 'm beat . Hey , look , Paul , why don 't I give you a ride home , huh ? - Come on . - Don . You know I run every day after work . Hey , it 's a way of unwinding at the end of the day . You know , a way of clearing your thoughts . See , you ought a try it some time . Look , we- - we could run together after work . What do you say ? Run , Paul ? ( chuckles ) I don 't think so . When the end of the day comes , all I do , I want someone to take me home in a stretcher . Running , my friend , is absolutely crazy . I 'll see you tomorrow . See you later , Don . ( echoing beep ) Cal : Start time noted . ( upbeat music playing ) ( car horn honks ) ( beeping ) ( beeping continues ) ( upbeat music continues ) ( music stops ) Okay , guys , that was really nice work . Please remember all this for tomorrow so that we can add it to what we 've got , okay ? Rehearsal four o 'clock tomorrow . Bye . ( beeps ) ( breathes out ) Hi . ( beeping ) Paul Bradford account . 3-0-7-4-1 Central Branch withdrawal . $ 20 . ( beeping ) - Hi , Cal . - Good evening , Paul . How did the repairs go ? Oh , they went fine . Yeah , it 's becoming too easy . ( sighs ) And how was my time ? Three minutes over yesterday . Yeah , I guess I got a lot on my mind . Account overdrawn . Yeah , I know . I 'll take care of it in the morning . ( dinging ) Paul ? - Hi . - Are you going to help , or what ? Oh , you got a lot of stuff . - You want some help ? - Hurry , hurry . - You want- - Oh . - Hurry , hurry . Hey . Wow . I only asked for a swordfish . What , did you buy out the whole store ? Hey , look , I bet you you have absolutely nothing in your refrigerator . Somebody 's gotta look after you . - Oh , yeah ? - Yeah . Oh , you owe me $ 26 . - I 'll pay for the wine . - Um ... - Um ... - I got a Chardonnay 1980 . It goes great with fish- - These are for you . Oh , Paul . God , they 're beautiful . Thank you . I knew something was up - when I first walked in the door . - Gwen . - You were acting really strange- - - Gwen , let 's get married . What ? Let 's get married , I ( stutters ) - - Look , it 'll- - it 'll be perfect , I- - I talked it over with Cal , - it all adds up . - You talked it over with Cal ? - Well , yeah , I- - - Oh , God . Why did this happen to me ? How did I fall for a guy whose first love is a machine ? ( scoffs ) Look , honey , you don 't understand . What I developed with Cal , it- - it 's what gives me an edge . ( scoffs ) God , every time I think about that experiment that you were involved in and how you were able to link up . Hey . He can 't link up the way we can . ( sighs ) Marry ? That is a big step , Mr. Bradford . And if I 'm going to be Mrs. Bradford , I want to know exactly how I stand in relationship to it . - Oh , not so loud . - Oh , my God . - See what I mean ? - I 'm just kidding . Look , I- - I 'm not in love with my computer , I am in love with you . I am . You 're a good cook . - Oh , yeah ? - Mm-hmm . Actually , Cal found this great recipe in this metropolitan art museum magazine . Mmm . That 's nice of her . Hey , I forgot dessert . Oh , Paul , I don 't want dessert . No , you 're going to love this . Okay . Da-da . ( chuckles ) Oh . Hmm ? ( sighs ) So , you like it ? Paul . I love you . ( sighs ) This thing with Cal is more than I can live with . You 're consumed with a passion . I would just be your wife . So , what 's wrong with that ? Nothing , except I want more . I want to be a part of your life . You will . You are . Come here . Come on . - What ? - Sit down . Cal , check your data on marriage to men with careers by women with intelligence , beauty , and hard heads . Stop it . I 'm not some stupid little kid . I have just as much brain power as you do . - ( whirling sound ) - Cal : Probable outcome , success . ( sighs ) Let 's go to bed . At least that 's one place I know I 'll have all of your attention . ( Cal warps ) ( birds chirping ) ( chiming sounds ) ( distant rumbling ) ( chiming continues ) Gwen ? Gwen ! ( yelling ) Gwen . ( gasping ) ( grunting ) ( panting ) Gwen ? Gwen . Gwen ? Gwen . ( zapping ) - Gwen : Paul ! - Gwen ? Gwen . Paul , help me . Look , let 's just- - Let 's piece this together , okay ? - Uh- - - Paul , these are real chains . All right , now , well , we were asleep ... and , uh ... and I had this dream . ( gasps ) ( zapping ) ( breathes out ) ( gasps ) I don 't believe this . You ... are a worthy opponent for Mestema . Now you have all power centered on you . You may call on your machines . Your magic machines . Anytime , anywhere in your world . Kneel . ( high-pitched whining ) ( thunderclap ) By the power of the prince of darkness ! I dub thee ... Excalibrate . Rise , Excalibrate . Excalibrate . Cal . X-CaI-BR8 . Cal : Mestema equals Beelzebub , Belial , Satan . ( laughs ) Excellent . Yours is a magic I have never encountered . Actually , uh ... ( stutters ) It 's not magic . Uh ... It 's- - It 's man 's ability to- - to take science in order to- - ( zapping ) For a thousand years , I have scoured the Earth and the ages . Here and there , I found a minor challenge . But now ... there is you . You and your machines . The new magic . Now , here is how it will be . I , Mestema ... have devised seven challenges . Lose one ... just one ... and I shall have both your souls . Paul , what if this thing is real and we can 't get out of here ? ( screams ) Hey , look , uh ... Look , I 'm Paul Bradford from Xyrex . ( zapping ) ( groans ) Gwen : Paul ? Are you there , Paul ? Gwen . Gwen , I 'm over here . Where ? I can 't see you . Paul : Just stay put . I 'll find you . But it 's cold . ( gasps ) Paul , where are we ? ( exhales ) It looks like Mestema 's private art gallery . Oh , my God , that 's Einstein . Oh , there 's Bloody Mary . What a weird combo . It looks like Louis XVI . Gwen : Isn 't he the one who invented the guillotine ? ( chuckles ) No . But he lost his head to one . Oh , Paul , I don 't like this place . It gives me the creeps . Yeah . It looks like every criminal in the world is here . - ( chuckles ) - Paul ? M-My hands are freezing . I can 't feel a thing . - ( wind howling ) - Just hang in there , Gwen . I think I see you . Paul ? My legs are frozen . I can 't move my feet . Just- - Just keep cool . - Cool . - But- - But Paul , I 'm freezing all over . Don 't leave me here . I 'll be right the- - Gwen : Paul ? Mestema : What is it , my dear Gwen ? Would you like me to ... warm you up ? Shall I raise the temperature ? Paul , is that you ? ( screams ) Paul . No ! ( screaming ) Paul ! Gwen : No . - Paul . - ( grunting ) ( zapping ) ( screams ) - Go . - Paul , what are we going to do ? - Cal ? - ( screams ) - No . - Ice crystal , where 's the ice crystal ? What ice crystal ? We 're going to die . ( screaming continues ) Pick . ( explosion ) Your performance was quite good , Excalibrate . Where is she ? Where is Gwen ? Trust me . Yeah , well , I don 't think so , Mestema . All right , all right , I 'll- - I 'll play your game . You 're playing because you have no choice . Good point . Where is Gwen ? Isn 't love grand ? ( sighs ) ( startled groan ) ( quietly muttering ) ( growls ) ( monster gurgling ) No . Greetings , Excalibrate . Welcome to my domain . I am Ratspit , caretaker of the dead . - Dead ? - Yes . I control these discarded husks that once contained the human soul . Why am I here ? To test you against that which every man must face : - Death . - ( muttering ) ( laughs ) ( laughing continues ) Well done . I commend your abilities . So , uh ... I met your challenge . Can I get out of here now ? Ratspit : Gaze upon it . It is your own death at the hands of Mestema . What 's this ? You give up so easily ? Not at all . It comes for you . You 're wrong , Spitrat . Ratspit . ( whirling sound ) How- - How is it that you can destroy that , which is your own destiny ? That creature was not my destiny . Mestema has perceived it . That thing was only a culmination of future possibilities . Mestema : In a future reality . I shall destroy you . I reject your reality and I substitute my own . ( Mestema laughs ) You are a bold adversary . ( zapping ) Oh , my God , Paul . Gwen , are you okay ? No , I 'm not okay . I 'm having a very bad dream and you just happen to be in it . - Lovely creature . - ( gasps ) Keep her out of it , Mestema . ( low growling ) - ( moans ) - ( continues growling ) Paul : Keep her out of it . Paul , don 't push your luck . ( gasps ) ( yells out ) ( clicking ) ( screams ) ( rumbling sounds ) ( clicking continues ) ( roaring ) Do you fancy music ? This is a piece of my own composing . ( ghostly singing ) ( upbeat rock-n-roll music playing ) You like this noise ? You should have your fill of it . ( rock music playing ) Paul . ( singing ) I 'm a liar And I 'm a cheat I have no morals And I 'm a thief Pillage and plunder Curse those who enter I am the killer And tormentor ( music continues ) I 'm a sinner I kiss the breast I am a sadist That whips the flesh I 'll beat the women Take those who enter You 'll be molested I 'm tormentor . ( zapping ) ( screams ) No ! Paul ! ( screaming continues ) Paul ! ( whimpers ) ( man singing ) Tormentor Tormentor - Tormentor - ( Gwen screams ) Tormentor No ! ( high-pitched sound ) Congratulations , Excalibrate . You performed magnificently . Now , let us continue our conversation . We 've got nothing to talk about . Nonsense . We have arts , history , myths , love , hate , magic . Yeah , well , I only talk about those things with people , Mestema . - Paul , be careful . - You know what you are ? You 're the lowest of the low . You use people for your own ... entertainment . Your own little whims and fancies . - You 're an egotistical , overbearing- - - ( grunts ) ( loud explosion ) ( clicks ) That is no way to penetrate this barrier . It is the strength of a million souls . The power of the dead . Oh , Paul . You have spirit , woman . Why waste your tender youth ? Your supple body ? He is a mere child . Not from where I 'm standing . It looks like you got more than you bargained for . How ... quaint . ( chuckling ) ( zapping ) ( birds chirping ) ( whirring ) Cal : Alert . - Alert . - ( whirring continues ) ( sighs ) ( rustling footsteps ) ( speaking native language ) Hey ! ( whirling sounds ) Cal : Sensing presence of occult power . ( beeping ) ( rumbling footsteps ) - ( footsteps continue ) - Cal : Scanning data bank . Tammock , origin Indonesia . ( tittering ) ( no audible dialogue ) ( gasps ) Do you really know this man ? I have a proposition for you , Excalibrate . Your freedom for , uh ... So , that 's it ? Paul , he wouldn 't . Not even one minute even consider . - Would you , Paul ? - Say the word , and it ends . The word is , " Forget it . " ( sighs ) Let me see , let me think . What would tempt you ? I offer you freedom . And wealth sufficient to create your own empire . In return ... ( Gwen exhales ) I 'd say I know him pretty well , Mestema . Oh ? Foul . Three for one , my best offer . Yours , for as long as you can tolerate the ecstasy . Paul ? Good try , Mestema . Yeah , damn good try . You 're a fool ! I don 't think so . Anyway , you know what they say . " There 's no fool like an old fool . " ( sighs ) ( blows air ) ( yells ) ( water trickling ) ( sighs ) Mestema : Excalibrate . I 'm touched by your grief . But you have no time to waste . The paper you read is tomorrow 's headline . Your Gwen is alive . For now . You have one hour to find and save her from his cold , sharp blade . Get my point ? Cal : Accessing police files . Want to tell me what you 're doing here ? - ( chuckles ) - What we got here ? - Huh , come here , turn around . - Look , I know this doesn 't look very good , but I can explain . Sure , like Halloween , right ? - ( sighs ) Look- - - Freeze . - We got a body . - Put your hands behind your back , - come on , lean over . - Hold on , hold on . - Freeze . - Come on , get the cuffs on him . - Come on . - Guys , you don 't understand . There 's going to be another murder . Come on , we gotta stop it . 5-Adam-49 , requesting supervisor and back-up units in an alley behind 304 West 21st . So , what are you supposed to be in that outfit ? Gumby ? ( laughs ) I wonder where Pokey is . - Yeah . - Listen , that reminds me , Lucille 's sister is coming into town this weekend . Gwen ? - Gwen ! - Hey ! - Hey , hey , shut up ! - Gwen ! ( radio chatter ) Officer : What do you think you 're doing back there , my friend ? - Woman on radio : Yeah , go ahead . - Uh ... - Woman : Yeah . - ( chuckles ) This costume 's kind of itchy . - Officer : Yeah ? - You guys got a back scratcher on you ? Hey , you 're a funny guy . Now , shut up . So , what 's this you 're reading ? - Officer # 2 : It 's a book . - ( air hissing ) Officer : What 's it about ? - A future . - And this book tells you the future ? - Get out . - Woman on radio : 10-4 , stand by . ( hissing continues ) Ouch ! This car 's got a bumpy ride . You guys could use some new shocks . What am I eating ? - What ? - What am I eating ? - Donuts . - What kind of donuts ? Officer # 2 : The jelly donut . Officer : I hate jelly donuts , man . - Officer # 2 : You didn 't tell me . - Officer : I never eat jelly donuts . Officer # 2 : Tell me next time . ( radio chatter continues ) - ( clicks ) - ( coughing ) - Officer : Shut up . - ( chuckles ) This thing 's kind of drafty . Shut up . Officer # 2 : This guy 's somethin ' . Officer : You 're somethin ' . I ask for any kind of plain donut , you give me a jelly donut . Yo , where 'd he go ? How 'd he get out of here ? Cal : Julie Waters , age 23 , occupation : actress . Oh , let me help you with these . Oh , no , thanks . I- - I got ' em . - You 're a performer . - Yeah , I 'm late . Good luck . Cal : Probable location for next murder : vacant lot , 654 South Swall Dr. Distance : 7 / 10ths of a mile . Alternate location : abandoned auditorium location , - 2133 Lexington . - ( sighs ) Vacant lot . Auditorium . - Dancing . - Cal : The distance is 1 .1 miles . ( Cal 's voice slurs ) ETA , five minutes . ( whirring ) Suspect seen headed east- - Woman on radio : ... on 5th Street . All units respond . ( sirens wailing in distance ) Are they still holding the auditions ? Hurry , they just finished . - Hey . - There 's going to be a murder , call the police . Cal : Sixty seconds to challenge termination . ( Gwen whimpering ) Oh , my God , Paul . - Are you okay ? - Oh , God , he tried to kill me . I- - He followed me to the audition , ( stutters ) and then afterwards , I was getting dressed , and I- - I got the part . I got the part . Cal : Five seconds to challenge termination . ( grunting ) - Hey , did you see what I saw ? - Nope . Me neither . ( exhales ) Paul , I don 't think I can go through this anymore . We 'll make it . Look , when this is all over , what if he doesn 't let us go ? Trust me . Paul , I think we 're missing something . This whole contest thing , there 's more in it for him or else he would 've just zapped us . What is that word , " zapped ? " It 's a magic word , Mestema . If I were to zap you . ( grunts ) Hear me , Baal-baelum . Hear me , incubus Astaroth . Abbadon , Mammon . - ( growls ) - If I so wished , it would destroy you . Great . Gwen : Paul ? No . No way , Mestema . - You can forget it . - Paul ? I 'm gonna regret this . ( grunts ) ( whirring sound ) Cal : Warning , thermonuclear activity . ( whirring sound continues ) ( snarls ) ( snarling continues ) Gwen : Paul ! Gwen ? ( liquid bubbling ) ( laughs ) So , this is the challenge , huh ? Do I even need the computer for this ? ( growls ) I suppose this is my idea , right ? Cal : Scan reflection , program rendered . ( growls ) Cal : A totally unstable condition exists . The chances of hitting the target with a controlled strike are zero . ( object thuds ) ( explosion roars , rumbling ) ( quietly groaning ) Woman : You didn 't listen . You would 've won by simply walking out of the cave . I didn 't know . I had no idea . I , too , transgressed , and was banished to this cave . I 'm sorry . If there 's something ... Anything I can do ... You 've done it . ( sighs ) Yeah . Mestema : I remember when I was a lad . We found a cat . It was scavenging in an alley . We covered it in cold tar . Except for the face and the eyes . And then we lit the tail . What a sight . I shall never forget it . A howling torch , streaking across a field . It turned and spun in a series of wild gyrations and leaps . And finally ... into a twitching mass . Its insides burst forth in wet sputters . Its eyes bulged to the size and the brilliance of agates . ( sighs ) Animals can be such fun . Ahimsa . Where did you hear that word ? Ahimsa . Respect for every living being . For every creature that can feel . What conceit , what hypocrisy . You mortals think you are so full of heart and soul and love and kindness . ( chuckles ) You think your god looks down on you with tenderness and mercy ? You 're mistaken , my friend . It is humanity , not the devil , that is red in tooth and claw . It is your god that rains down terror on you . You have no heart and no soul , Mestema . And that 's why you 're bored . That 's why your immortality is Hell . Prepare for the end . ( gasps ) Paul : Alone at last . Yeah , like the last people on Earth . Well , at least you 're not chained to the rock . ( groans ) - Nice outfit . - ( laughs ) Yeah , another Mestema original . - ( chuckles ) - Where are we ? Cal ? Scan communication frequencies . - ( whirring ) - See if you can find out where we are . - Cal : Scanning . - Hey , don 't leave me . Cal : Scan shows inhabitants hostile . Terrific . Cal : Warning , frequency scan intercepted by local military . - Military hostile . - ( vehicles approaching ) What do we do now ? Ask Cal . Cal , prepare laser mode . ( in high-pitched voice ) Boy , oh , boy . ( giggles ) Oh , boy . We got you now . We got you , I got him here . Come on , you guys . Let 's go , let 's kill him . Let 's kill him now . Come on . ( all chattering ) ( grunts ) - ( chuckles ) - ( chattering ) Uh ... could you guys show us the way to the Las Vegas Hilton ? - ( grunts ) - Oh . ( groans ) - ( growls ) - Let 's get him now . Let 's get him . Let 's kill him . - Hey , come on . - ( whimpers ) - ( mumbling ) - Paul : Hey . Small soldier : What is that thing ? Come on , let me see it , what is it ? ( mumbling ) I want to kill him , I want to kill him . - Cal , still in laser mode ? - Come on , let me see . - Affirmative . - What is that ? Give it to me . Come on , I was here first . I want to see it . Come on , give it to me . Okay , then I 'm going to shoot them . I 'm gonna shoot them both . I want you to give it to- - Come on , come on . C-Come on . Cal , three coordinates . 28 degrees x-axis . 1-8-3 , 2-8-4 , 3-1-6 . Fire . Paul , do you know where you 're going ? The Las Vegas Hilton ? Oh , boy . Oh , my God . It 's the little guy . ( grunts ) ( yelps ) Why , you little creep . Yee-haw ! All right , Mestema , enough is enough . Paul : Hey , what are you doing ? Good shot , huh ? ( laughs ) Whoo . Gwen : What is it ? We 're out of control . Cal , what 's going on ? Cal : Remote control . Well , jam the signal . Override the remote . Cal : Remote control is not conventional . Mestema . Cal : Sensors show second vehicle . - Trajectory ... - Paul . Cal : ... Identical to yours . Opposite direction . Mestema ! The game is over . You call this a contest , Mestema ? I do all the fighting while you sit around like some fat overlord waiting to see how I fare . A real contest is one man against one man . But then , you 've never been in a real battle before . You have spirit . And all you have is your magic . My magic is powerful . All powerful . It can do anything ! Except relieve you of your boredom . I have seen a thousand plagues . A thousand wars . And I will be here when you are dust . So , you finish me off , then what ? Another thousand years of boredom ? ( exhales ) Mestema , I know what you want . But you 're not going to get it sitting on the sidelines watching some worthy opponent have all the fun . Only mortals who risk losing can know real excitement . I , the Excalibrate , challenge you to a real contest . You have some trick up your sleeve , eh ? One man against one man . In this arena . No magic . No tricks . Paul , he 's a giant . You can 't possibly win . It is a trick , I know it 's a trick . Trust me . What are the conditions ? What are the rules ? No rules , except that we go free . ( grunts ) ( grunting continues ) Get up ! ( growls ) - ( grunts ) - Yes . Get him ! ( yells ) ( both groaning ) ( groaning continues ) ( incants in foreign language ) No ! ( beeping ) ( screaming ) ( screams ) Cal ! ( zapping ) ( whimpers ) - You okay ? - Yeah . ( grunts ) - ( chuckles ) - Oh , God . Oh , we 're home . - Yeah . - We won . - ( laughs ) - Cal : Hello , Paul . I 'm back . I 'm not so sure . Yes . - Yes ? - Let 's get married . ( chuckles ) Let 's get what ? Well , I talked it over with Cal and it all adds up . ( laughs ) Paul , is that you ? ( laughs ) ( officers chattering ) ( laser zaps ) Paul ? Mestema !

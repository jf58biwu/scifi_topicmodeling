 Speak to us . Spirits of darkness . ( PLUMMETING ) What ? Do something , get me out of here ! I 'm Harry Houdini . You are from the other side . ( GIRLS SCREAMING ) Behold the power of God , Satan . I really think this is just a misunderstanding . Today we stand trial and tomorrow we shall meet our maker . What have we done ? JUDGE : You are found guilty of the charge of practicing witch craft . BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! MAN 1 : Do not let her escape ! ( SCREAMING ) Catch the devil witch ! ( BARKING ) MAN 2 : Let the dogs lead , follow the dogs . There is no running from the lord , Abiah Folger . Over there ! The witch runs toward the rocks ! There she is . Get her ! ( SCREAMS ) GIRL : The witch . She chokes me . She possesses my soul . ( GIRLS SCREAMING ) You see what the witch does ? She is an instrument of Satan ! Be these accusations true , Abiah Folger ? I 'm as innocent as an unborn child . You are a witch ! I am a victim . I am a victim of thy daughter 's imagination , Reverend Parris . The witch stabs me with her eyes . Seize her ! No , I 'm innocent . Please . Please , I 'm innocent . Oh , good Lord , help me . ( PLUMMETING ) ( GROANS ) Bat 's breath ! It 's bad enough we landed in the dark , but I got to introduce my rear end to this rock that looks like the Matterhorn . Bogg . Look at that , will you ? Forget it , Bogg . Look at that . Oh , no . Behold the power of God , Satan ! You are impotent in the face of our Lord . Look , I really think this is just a misunderstanding . Please help me ! They 'll kill me ! Take them ! Come on , kid ! Run ! The devils head for the rocks ! After them . JEFFREY : Where 're we going , Bogg ? BOGG : Up . BOGG : Hurry , around the back . This cave leads somewhere ? I 'm not sure . Bogg ? So she 's not sure . You got a better idea ? Burn , devils ! Burn ! JEFFREY : Be careful , Bogg . Not bad . I 'll give him a 5.7 . Will you can the diving jokes ? Let 's get out of here . Hey , it looks like a passageway around the ... Surrender to the Lord , Satan . JEFFREY : This is perfect . Just perfect . BOGG : Look , I said I was sorry . Yeah , but I can 't believe this . What an entrance . Right in the middle of a Salem witch hunt . Can 't you control that thing ? Doesn 't come with a steering wheel . What 's the date ? ( BEEPING ) November 13th , 1692 . Friday ? It is . Figures . November ? Bogg , we studied this last year in school . The last Salem witches were hung in September 1692 . That was the end of it . ABIAH : The end ? I do not know what school you attend , but believe me , this is just the beginning . Today we stand trial and tomorrow we shall meet our maker . That is the pattern . What have we done ? I cannot speak for you . But in my case , I did publicly denounce these trials and those wicked little girls who started them . You mean , those screaming kids from last night ? Yes . My teacher said it was like rock and roll . A way the kids rebelled against their parents and the strict way the Puritans lived . Only this version 's a lot deadlier . ( ABIAH SOBBING ) I cannot believe this is happening . Abby , we 'll help you . How can you ? Unless it 's true . What 's true ? Before you came from the sky , I asked for help from heaven . Your clothing , your speech , your objects . Art thou from heaven ? Or are you from hell ? NOYES : And from whence did these two beings come ? From the darkness you say . I say , from hell . CROWD : Yeah ! Yeah ! These agents of Satan came . Dropped from the sky by the witch , Folger beckoned . The witch hurt me ! ( ALL SCREAMING ) You know it 's not true . You know it ! The witch hurt me ! Do you really believe we came from hell ? This is ridiculous . Are you denying that you fell from the sky ? It seems to me that angels fall from the sky . And do angels wear such immodest clothing ? Oh , you got to be kidding ! NOYES : And they speak with such strange tongues ? CROWD : No ! Give me a break . If this is not the work of Satan , then God is not in his heaven above . ( BEEPING ) Agents of Satan ! Agents of Satan ! And they should be punished as such ! ( SCREAMING ) ( GAVEL POUNDING ) That guy 's a regular Clarence Darrow . What 're they gonna do to us , Bogg ? Nothing , if we can get that Omni back . ( GAVEL POUNDING ) The accused will step down and approach the bench for sentencing . Aren 't we allowed a defense ? CROWD : No ! No ! There is no defense for crimes against the Lord . Step down ! ( CROWD MURMURING ) Abiah Folger , you are found guilty of the charge of practicing witchcraft in the town of Salem . And you are hereby sentenced to hang by the neck until dead , at noon on the morrow . JEFFREY : You can 't do this to us . ( CROWD CHATTERING ) ( GAVEL POUNDING ) As to your two agents ... I 'll confess to anything . Just spare the woman and the boy . CROWD : No ! No ! The devil comes in many shapes and sizes . The witch summoned both of you and you both shall pay the price . He 's just a kid . ( CROWD YELLING ) This court is not without mercy . The boy is hereby ordered to Duxbury Prison , where he is sentenced to spend the remainder of his days on earth . No ! He is additionally sentenced , as is the witch , to watch your death , agent of Satan , and that death is to be without precedent in these colonies . ( CROWD CLAMORING ) I hereby decree that at the stroke of midnight this night , you shall be burned to death at the stake . Fire shall fight fire ! ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) JEFFREY : Will I just die , Bogg ? I mean , really ? BOGG : We 're regular flesh and blood , kid . Only thing that makes us special is that Omni . ABIAH : Do you mean your device could save us ? If I could get my hands on it . But I 'm not holding my breath . I think I 'll never see Josiah again . Josiah ? Josiah Franklin , my betrothed . He 's a candle maker from Boston . Franklin ? I wonder when he 'll hear of this . Benjamin Franklin , Bogg . Josiah . Josiah Franklin was a candle maker in Boston . He and his wife Abiah had a son . Benjamin . Benjamin Franklin ? You mean the guy with the granny glasses and the long , wavy hair ? I do not understand . Benjamin ? Signed the Declaration of Independence , was ambassador to France . That 's where I met him . You know , for being a dumpy kind of guy , he sure had a way with the women . Yeah , well , you 're looking at his mother . Mother ? Are you saying I have a child ? You would 've if we could 've gotten you out of here . And right now that seems like the most unlikely thing in the world . JEFFREY : Bogg . They can 't do it , Bogg . I don 't think we can stop them . But we didn 't do anything . That 's right , kid . Just like all the other witches . Bring him forward . ( SOBBING ) Bring the devil to his end now ! Bogg ! We 'll see each other sometime . Bogg , you can 't . You can 't . Don 't let them do it . Just know you 're the best thing that ever happened to me , kid . Out of all the people in time , the best . Take care of him for me , will you ? At least , as long as you can . Tie him ! No ! JEFFREY : No , don 't ! Don 't ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Stop it ! Any final words ? How can you people be so blind ? Blind ? Murdering innocent people in the name of God . This is not murder , devil ! We are merely returning you from whence you came . Light the fire ! No ! Don 't ! Stop ! ABIAH : You can 't be doing this . You can 't burn people like this ! You can 't ! It 's not right ! We 're not witches . No ! Stop it ! Will Satan help you , devil ? Or do you need this talisman to set you free ? ( LAUGHING ) Burn , devil . Burn ! ALL : Burn , devil , burn ! Burn , devil , burn ! ( GIRLS SCREAMING ) He vanished ! MAN : The devils have vanished . Such is the power of Satan ! We are seeking contact with the other side . Come to us . Speak to us . Speak through me to these people . Who are you ? I am Harry Houdini . And I don 't believe any of this . Then what do you want of me ? I want you to give me a sign . Something to prove you are from the other side . Give me a sign , or I 'm going to get up and leave . A sign ! ( PLUMMETING ) ( SCREAMING ) WOMAN : He 's not from here ! Where the heck are we ? Out , get me out ! Do something , get me out of here ! Where did they come from ? Please ! Get me out of here ! I lost the Omni ! Boston , 1924 . Green light . Let 's get out of here . I 'm Harry Houdini . You are from the other side . You are the sign . ( BEEPING ) BOGG : Jeffrey , get over here with that . Let 's go . Come on . Come on , kid . ( PLUMMETING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( SIGHS ) Nice . Kid , you were wonderful back there . The way you jumped into the fire like that . I 'm really proud . Yeah , well , I think we got a problem , Bogg . No , we don 't . Believe me . To smell like a rotten halibut 's a lot better than to smell like a charbroiled t-bone . ( BEEPING ) 1814 , Baltimore . Just fine with me . Red light and all . Yeah , well , take a good long look and kiss it goodbye . That was Harry Houdini back there . Who ? Harry Houdini . The greatest escape artist who ever lived . We got to go back . Go back ? To that dark room with all those screaming maniacs ? You think I 'm crazy ? It was a séance . Whatever it was , it was a waste of time . We got to go back to Salem and Abby . After we fix Houdini . I don 't think I 'm getting through to you . Look , the Omni had a green light when we landed . So we landed in a green zone . We sure didn 't have time to set it in the fire . It turned red before we left . It did ? That 's what I 'm trying to tell you . When Houdini saw us , he thought we were ghosts . I 'm not following this , kid . Look , when he wasn 't performing , Houdini used to go around the country exposing phony séances . What we did when we dropped in was make him believe the séance was real . So what ? We made one guy believe in ghosts . Don 't you see ? It could change his whole life . What if he gives up magic ? What if he makes millions of people believe that the phony séances are real ? I 'm sorry , kid . I just don 't think it 's that big a deal . What is it ? Just a poem . " Oh , say , can you see by the dawn 's early light , what so proudly we hailed ... " At the twilight 's last gleaming . How 'd you know ? Mr. Key ! Mr. Key ! Good morning , my enthusiastic young man . Good morning , sir . You dropped this . ( EXCLAIMS ) I wrote this when the British were rowing me ashore this morning . It was a proud sight , son . Those stars and stripes still flying over McHenry . I wrote this to help me remember . To help us all remember . Pardon me ? Have a nice day , sir . I will . And thank you . What was that all about ? Oh , that poem you were going to throw away ? Yeah ? Those were the lyrics to our national anthem . That was Francis Scott Key . Oh . It 's no big deal , Bogg . Right . Well , I ... I guess we 'd better crack this little Houdini problem , huh ? Yeah . ( PLUMMETING ) Bat 's breath ! Ow ! Can 't you get that thing to come up with a better place to land ? You 're lucky it wasn 't the roof . This the same room ? Gives me the creeps . See if you can go find some lights . Why me ? I 'm just a kid . Come on . We 'll do it together . Stay where you are . Who are you ? Jeffrey Jones and Phineas Bogg . What do you want ? We want to see Harry Houdini . Stay where you are . I don 't think that 's necessary . Look , a secret passageway . And the ghost was a reflection on the glass . I 've shown you my secret . Now you show me yours . ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ON PHONOGRAPH ) I love your costumes . So realistic . Houdini 's absolutely convinced . He 's holding a press conference here tomorrow morning to announce to the world that he is giving up magic . Houdini 's giving up magic ? And his escape tricks and his illusions . The fool actually believes that I can conjure up ghosts . He says his magic is nothing next to the reality of what I can do . What we can do . I don 't drink . Then neither will I. There 's going to be a rebirth of mentalism because of this . And I 'm going to be the richest and most famous one of all . To think that just a few hours ago I was on the brink of destruction . Houdini would have ruined me if it hadn 't been for you . Thank you . ( CLEARING THROAT ) Excuse me . Where is he ? Houdini ? He 's at his hotel back in town . But we can 't let him see either one of you now , can we ? Wouldn 't think of it . Good . We 'll discuss your price after the press conference . In the meantime , I 'm leaving a couple of my men outside your door . I wouldn 't want you to disappear . Oh , I don 't know what this is , but I 'll hold onto it for a while until I find out . Great kisser . ( CHUCKLES ) ( DOOR CLOSES ) Great kisser . You 're really having a tough time hanging onto that thing , aren 't you ? Will you knock it off ? How was I supposed to know she was a pickpocket ? What happens if she presses the button ? It 's set to this time and place . She won 't go anywhere as long as she doesn 't touch the dials . Monkey suit still out there ? ( SIGHING ) Yep ! ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) Hey , I think that 's him . Houdini ? Where ? All he 'd have to do is just see one of us and he 'd know we weren 't really ghosts . You know something ? What ? We 've been locked up in here a pretty long time . All right . One at a time . Kid first . Okay , kid . Bogg ! The kid ! Get the kid ! My cake ! Reality . You 've completely altered my understanding of the word . Next to last night 's experience , this rose , life . Simply nothing . ( CHUCKLING ) I hope you don 't mind if I 'm telling the press that I 'll be studying with you . I mean , if you 'll accept me , that is . I am truly awed by your achievement . And I am truly flattered , Mr. Houdini . Please . Harry . Harry . JEFFREY : Mr. Houdini ! Mr. Houdini ! Mr. Houdini ! Mr. Houdini ! It 's the boy . It 's me . The kid from last night . I 'm not a ghost . So you aren 't , and I 'm certainly a fool . How fortunate that you 're holding a press conference . By this time tomorrow the whole country will know you for the fraud that you are . I seriously doubt that , Harry . By this time tomorrow , you and your little ghost here will be gone . You really think the press is gonna buy this ? Oh , come on , Harry . They 'll love it . It 's already on the front page of the evening edition . " Houdini 's Mysterious Disappearance . " A trip to the netherworld . We 're holding a séance for you as soon as we get back . Ready , Margaret . Gentlemen . It is customary for magicians to pass on their tricks before they die . Now , do you want to tell me about this ? I pushed the button and nothing happens . I thought you were more sophisticated than that . It 's just a prop . Just part of the illusion . I 'll keep it as a souvenir . Phineas . ( CLICKING TONGUE ) You really are a great kisser . Oh , Harry . This is to help you appreciate the drama . You were always big on drama . When the flame goes out , so do you . ( OWL HOOTING ) Think of it as a challenge , gentlemen . Let 's see you get out of this one . ( HAMMERING ) Double-jointed . I can get out of any shackle made . Can you get us out of this ? Do you know how many times I 've been buried alive ? How many death-defying situations I 've put myself in ? ( KNOCKING ) I know , I 've read about them all . This is a piece of cake , right ? With a steam shovel and a crowbar it 's a piece of cake . See , all of my buried alive acts , they were illusions , son . This is real . I 'm sorry . ( LAUGHING ) What 's so funny ? Now we 'll never get back to Abby . The man said we 're gonna check out . This is it . ( LAUGHING ) He 's crazy . No , he 's not . What he is , is a great kisser . Yeah , I guess . We seek Harry Houdini . Oh , spirits of darkness is he with you ? Speak to us . Speak to us ! Where is Houdini ? ( PLUMMETING ) ( MONKEY SCREECHING ) ( PEOPLE CLAMORING ) The blindfold stays on ! Stay down . BOGG : These natives sure are restless . What was that ? What 's happening ? ( BEEPING ) You don 't want to know . Can 't you set that thing any faster ? I 'm trying . You want us to miss again ? Come to us , spirit of darkness . Speak to us . Speak to us ! MAN : What do you want of me ? MARGARET : We are trying to find someone . Are you able to help us ? Who are you seeking ? Give me a name . ( PLUMMETING ) Houdini . Where is Harry Houdini ? WOMAN : Not again ! Houdini . How ? There was yelling . It was bright . An illusion ? It was an illusion . Yes . A brilliant illusion . Ladies and gentlemen , I give you Harry Houdini . ( ALL CLAPPING ) Ladies and gentlemen , thank you , thank you . Nothing gives me greater pleasure than exposing a fraud . But tonight , I have the added distinction of exposing both a fraud and a criminal . This very evening this woman attempted to bury me and my companions alive . Oh , you wretched woman . HARRY : My friends were ghosts , she held them against their will . Despite the fact that they wanted to reveal this ... We 're not gonna go now are we ? Green light , kid . I don 't want Houdini asking any embarrassing questions . But ... No buts . You and I are needed back in Salem . But how did you do it ? How did you get out , Harry ? My dear friend , a good magician never reveals his secrets . Did we not see what Satan did when faced with justice from our Lord ? CROWD : Yes ! Have we anything to fear ? CROWD : No ! Then I think we should eliminate that which brought Satan to Salem . Hang this woman . Hang this witch now . At once . No , no ! ALL : Hang her ! Hang her ! Where are your devils now , witch ? Why aren 't they here to save you ? ( ALL LAUGHING ) ( PLUMMETING ) They 're here ! Come on , kid ! The devils head for the rocks ! After them ! Get them ! Some of you men come with me . ABIAH : I cannot understand how you can be in the fire one moment and gone from sight the next . ( SCREAMS ) Don 't leave me . I don 't think we 've time to talk about it right now . Why are we going up here anyway ? Didn 't this get us caught before ? You got a better idea and I 'll stop to listen . In the meantime , climb . They 're making for the cave ! Go around the other side . In there ! Come on , we got to do it before they get around the rock . Do what ? It 'll take us forever ... Oh , no . One , two ... Surely you aren 't going to ... Geronimo ! They can 't get away . MAN : Where 'd they go ? Where ... Where did they go ? Do you have them ? It appears the devils are gone . Okay , come on up . Are they gone ? For the time being . That was a good trick , kid . Thanks . I saw it once in a movie . What 's a movie ? Yeah , see , these guys , they 're escaping from prison . It 's really great ... Jeff . Oh , right . Sorry . I don 't think you 'd understand . I don 't understand anything that has transpired . ( BEEPING ) Green ? Still red . Now I don 't understand . We may have saved Ben Franklin 's mother , but we haven 't stopped the witch trials . There 's no telling how many innocent people are gonna die if this goes on . Too bad you could not bring back those who have already died . You know something , Abby , maybe we can . ( BELL RINGING ) Hear ye ! Hear ye ! Hear ye ! Hear ye ! The Honorable Justice Samuel Sewell hath declared that on this day , the 14 of November in the year of our Lord , 1692 a search of all homes and property shall take place . The object being to find the witch , Abiah Folger , and her agents of Satan . The good and right Reverends Noyes and Parris shall lead such search and conduct a meeting of the town upon its completion . Said meeting shall commence at 8 : 00 by the clock this evening . And end in good time . Hear ye ! Hear ye ! Hear ye ! Hear ye ! MAN : The Honorable Justice Samuel Sewell hath declared that on this day , the 14 of November in the year of our Lord , 1692 a search of all homes and property shall take place . The object being to find the witch ... Okay . ... and her agents of Satan . Are you certain we 're safe here ? Believe me . This is the last place on earth they 'd look . Where do you want these , Bogg ? Up by the altar . Relax . It 's all going to be over soon . That is not what bothers me . It is the glass . The glass ? Thou shalt not steal . Mr. Owen was planning to install these panes this very week . We 're only borrowing them . Trust me . Mr. Owens 's gonna have these back before he knows they 're missing . Where do you want them ? Line them up in the alcoves . We should be able to hide in there . BOGG : That 's it , kid . Right there . And these will create the illusion ? With enough candles and the right costumes . That 's the easy part . What then is difficult ? The performance . Getting Parris and Noyes and all those little girls to give up the witch hunts all depends on how well we play our parts . My very daughter says the devils were aided by yet another witch in this town . And that be the reason for not finding them . Be that true , young Betty ? And the witch , be it in this room now ? Where , Betty ? Name the witch ! Who desecrates this House of the Lord ? You , Reverend Noyes ! You are the one who desecrates this House of the Lord . That child knows no witches . Only in her imagination . Who are you , vision ? Goody Esty . The vision is Mary Esty killed this June past . I recognize her cloak . No . You be not Goody Esty . You be the devil , vision ! Would the devil make himself present in the House of the Lord , Reverend Parris ? This vision is the work of Abiah Folger and her devils . The witch has infected the very church . ( ALL SCREAMING ) BOGG : Silence children ! It is the imaginations of these children that have infected the church , Parris . Giles Cory . The farmer Cory . How much longer will you listen to their screaming voices instead of the voice of reason ? How many more innocent people will you allow to be murdered ? Innocent ? Cory , you gave no evidence . Was I given a chance , Reverend Noyes ? Or I ? What chance does an old woman stand against a pew of young girls ? Your ears were deaf to all but their screams . WOMAN : There are no witches in Salem . There never were . Suzanne Martin ? Tell them , Betty . Abigail . Did you have any real evidence against me ? On your souls , answer me . Betty ? Answer . On your souls . No . No ! ( CRYING ) NOYES : For all those we have hurt , all those we have killed , dear Lord , forgive us . Well , that about does it kid . Terrific . I gotta tell you , all this ghost and séance stuff is really giving me the creeps . You aren 't alone . All I want to do is get those back to Mr. Owen and move on . I think you should change your costume first . Bogg , remember Josiah in Boston . Right . Can 't forget little Ben . I think you 're wonderful , Phineas . Must you go ? I 'm afraid so . And you 'll never tell me the secrets of your disappearance ? Or who you are ? It 's a sworn secret . Abby , there 's something I 'd like to know . Yes ? How 'd you do that lady ghost over there in the corner ? I thought you were in the alcove with me . I was in the alcove with you . JEFFREY ...

 Are you looking for something , my friend ? - Move the M-16 or you 'll eat it . - Mark , come here . No more pictures . You 're in my way , piglet . You got a nasty mouth on you , pal . We 're going for a walk . Come on , let 's go . In about five seconds you 're gonna be cloud-dancing . They 're all bottlenecked in there . The place isn 't a camp , it 's a tomb . Come here , Slick . Mr. Macho Man , I want to talk to your boss . What 's wrong with you ? This is embarrassing . - Don 't even think about it . - We 've got a standoff here . Anybody ever clean this dump ? You should have looked ! I told you ! - Hey , come on . - All right . - What happened here ? - Them . I knew eventually you 'd crawl out from some munitions dump . How you doing , Gooder ? Short for " Do-gooder . " His nickname for me . We 've met before : Laos , El Salvador , you name it . He blows it up , I cover it with a camera and the folks back home hate him for it . I want you to meet Ham Tyler master of covert operations , communications and bad relations . This is Chris Farber , my associate . You people are doomed . If you 're lying , Pascal , you 've forged your last ticket . It 's the truth . I swear it is . You 'll find them there . He 's convinced you that you can win with muscle and God on your side . That attitude will get you dead . So let the pros do their job . That sounds familiar . I didn 't come here to argue . We don 't have time . There 's a world network . Do as you 're told . - Now , wait a minute , pal ... - Shut up . Pulling that stunt last night was pure luck . But without real leadership , you 're dead . We 're organized , we have a plan , and we 've got a new ammo to kill those lizards . You can stay independent and get wiped out or you can join us and help knock these lizards off the planet . It 's your choice . You heard what Donovan said . The guy 's a warmonger . Getting people killed turns him on ... Don 't you ever say that . Donovan may hate my guts , but he 'll tell you I know what I 'm doing . We 're not killers like you , Tyler . We may not be perfect , but we 're a unit and we 've made more noise than you have . - They know we 're here . - Which brings me to my next point ... That was Ruby ! They 're on their way . We 've got to run . They 're in that building . This is all we 've got . Gooder , get your people out of here . I 'll cover you . Teflon load in this ? - You bet . - All right . Let 's go . Move , move . He 's in here . Come on . Having fun ? - I need another mag . - You got it . - lt 's getting real busy out there . - I 'm almost finished . Good luck , brother . I 'm gone . Now that 's a waste of good luggage . - Thank you for coming . - My pleasure . - What did you want ? - A favor . Just ask . This is a photograph of my grandson . I 'd like him back . He 's been detained . - Consider it done . - Thank you . - l , too , have a favor to ask . - Oh ? Since IKristine Walsh 's unfortunate demise the position of world spokesperson has been vacant . I think you should fill it . Certainly , if you think ... I do . The job is yours . Now I must go . - Goodbye for now . - Goodbye . And thank you . Isn 't that wonderful news ... ? You stupid , greedy woman . Sean is Mike Donovan 's son . Don 't you understand ? They don 't care about your grandson . They 'll use Sean to catch Mike . I no longer consider Michael my son . This time you 've gone too far , Eleanor even for a stomach as strong as mine . I 'm leaving you . Once you go out that door , there 's no coming back . Thank God . - What is this place , anyway ? - lt 's an abandoned movie ranch . Are you hungry ? I have plenty of stuff . Do you want some cheese ? You can eat that , can 't you ? No , I am not hungry . Why are you being so nice to me , Harmony ? I lo like you , Willie . But you saw what I look like . You wanna know something ? I didn 't fall in love with your looks in the first place . No I guess I am not what you 'd call an " ox . " That 's fox , you dope . Fox . Yes . I 've got a plan to spring Julie . Forget about her . We 're not at war over your love life . Personal ? She 's our leader . Was your leader . She 's damaged goods now . - No way . - Nobody survives a conversion chamber . They either own her or her mind 's gone . She 's better off dead . - Don 't push me too hard . - So face the facts and give her up . We 're gonna get her back , with or without your help . - You 're not giving orders anymore . - Oh , no ? Every man and woman in this unit will back me . Fine , we 'll get her back . Then we 'll see if she 's turned traitor . - How are her vital signs ? - She has a congenital heart condition . That 's not dangerous . With what you 're about to do , any physiological flaw could become acute . She has a fear and loathing of anything abandoned . - Why ? - Early trauma . Something to do with being chased . She hid in a deserted building . - Begin . - Start with mood conversion , mode one . - Was she very young ? - Between 5 and 8 years old . Good . Give her breathing . Heavy breathing . Julie , it 's Diana . Let me help you out of this place . There 's someone trying to hurt you . Can you see him ? Julie ... Julie ... No , it 's a lie ! You 're a lie ! - Julie ! - No . Go to conversion mode two . - Her heart rhythms are irregular . - I know what I 'm doing . You don 't exist ! You don 't exist ! You 're not there . You 're a mind game ! You 're just a stupid mind game . Her mind is strong . She will be converted , damn her . Go to conversion mode three . Julie , I 'm going to make all those things go away . I 'm here to help . Come to me . Reach out to me . I want to help you , Julie . Let me help you . No ! Be careful , Diana . Julie ! Julie ! Julie ... She 's going into cardiac arrest . She 's going to die ! Where 's your gator buddy ? Cool it with that talk . He 's one of us . Gooder , you 'll trust anyone . This whole setup stinks . Just like a swamp gator . Sneak up on you every time . Martin . This person is one of us . I don 't like him , but I trust him . I ask you to do the same . I trust you , Mike . That 's enough . How 's Julie ? She hasn 't broken yet , but she will . We 've gotta get her out . We need you and the Fifth Columnists to help . I wish I could help , but under the circumstances ... You do as the man tells you , or I 'll turn you into an hors d 'oeuvre . Are there many more like this one ? No , selective breeding keeps them at a minimum . All right . I 'll listen , but I can promise nothing . Here 's a picture of the boy . - His name ? - That 's not important . Just find him . Conduct a thorough search of the mother ship and report back to me . Consider it a surprise present for Diana . Yes , sir . Attention , all personnel . Squadron commander 's ship has landed . - Hello , Diana . - Welcome , commander . The Leader sends his greetings . I 'm afraid you 've caught me by surprise . I was just informed of your arrival . I 'm sorry , I hope I haven 't thrown you off schedule . No , I would have liked more time to prepare your reception a reception befitting a supreme commander . How very thoughtful of you . The Leader wants a schedule speedup so I 've brought experts for a special project . If it succeeds , we can pump all of Southern California 's water ... - ... in the next 30 days . - I can handle that . It could become a military issue , which is an area I know well . I 'm aware of that . The resistance has been causing delays , even jeopardizing our mission . We were led to believe that this area 's rebels were ineffective . Steven is the only one who 's ineffective in dealing with the rebels . However , I have captured their leader , and I ... That 's not important . What is important is that we do as we 're told . Help . Help ... Help ... ! - What 's the matter ? - Nothing . Go back to sleep . Oh , God ... ! - Why are you still up ? What 's wrong ? - Robin 's sick . - Where is she ? - ln the bathroom . Robin ? Robin , it 's Daddy . Open the door . Don 't ! It won 't let me kill it . It won 't let me die . - lt 's turning me into one of them . - No , no . No ! Diana , I warned you of the seriousness ... Yes , yes . Never mind . Give me maximum . No ! Let me stop the pain , Julie . Let me help you . No ! Then run , Julie . Run for your life . Run faster , Julie , run faster . Heart rhythm 's becoming irregular again . No ! Give me your hand . Let me help you out of there . Yes . Yes , Mama . Mama ! Yes . Yes . Yes . Tell me , Julie . Tell me what you want . To be yours . To be yours . Just stop it . Please ! Stop it . He 's dead . They 're lovely , don 't you think ? A pity we don 't have such creatures on our planet . Yes , they 're lovely . - They may try another assassination . - Don 't be ridiculous . Donovan is dead . Julie is almost converted . The resistance movement is crippled . We have nothing to fear from them . Nevertheless , I 've increased security . I give the orders on my ship . Your ship is but one in my squadron . You forget your rank , Diana . I may not have your rank , but I have the Leader 's special interest which , I might say , is even more desirable than rank . Don 't rely too heavily on that relationship . That trap has seen heavy traffic . I don 't believe you . Diana , my dear , sex for favors is as old as ambition . It is a foundation too fragile for your ambition . You 've managed . That 's because I 've managed my ambition . You might reflect that your lover has sent you 56 trillion miles away . Hardly an indication he can 't bear not to see you . Diana , I think you should come with me . I have something to show you . One of us . One of my own people tried to kill me ! Fifth Column . Every ship 's reporting incidents . Not this ship . I 'll have no traitors onboard ! I want a staff meeting immediately . With your permission , of course , Pamela . If I may ? I suggest we transfer all important prisoners to Earth 's security headquarters , until it 's safe . As long as the ship 's contaminated , we 're vulnerable . - We don 't want to lose their leader . - I agree . Yes . Do it . Is she always like that ? - Like what ? - On edge . Frankly , yes . - Must be the strain of her position . - Yes , must be . We must offer her support . We wouldn 't want her to stumble , would we ? No , of course not . That was incredible . You have a lot of energy for someone who works all the time . Yeah ? I like my work . They 're trusting me with a lot of responsibility now . - Yeah ? Like what ? - Like what ? The big reception tomorrow at security headquarters . Twenty troopers , all at my command . That many ? What 's the big occasion ? Steven and Diana are bringing down prisoners from the mother ship . They 're arriving at 2100 hours . - I can see you after that . - Oh , only prisoners . I thought it 'd be something exciting . I 'm talking about Julie what 's-her-face the head of the resistance . She 's not important enough for you ? I guess so . I don 't pay attention to politics . Good , because you can give all your attention to me . I 'm such a lucky girl , aren 't I ? Hey , I 'm on your side now . Don 't sneak up on me ! I just got a third-degree burn bringing you coffee . Relax . She 's not sleeping around on you . She 's just doing what she has to do . I don 't have to like it . No , you don 't have to like it . But stop whipping yourself . It just makes me crazy to think about her touching him . Think about the way Maggie feels . This damn war is tough on everybody here , all of us ! Buddy , she needs you to be strong for her . Here . Thanks . - lf Martin 's correct ... - Here you go , guys . It 'll be okay . I 'm sure he 's right . Let 's not waste it , okay ? There 's your new ammo . It rips through their armor . Ham came through . He always does . - Listen ! - I don 't care if you can 't handle it . There you go . Been practicing ? I 'm no William Tell . You 'll do fine . New loads . Teflon tips . Big deal . Hey , I want to talk to you ! - You think I 'm a whore ? - I don 't know ! - Decide and we can talk ... - We 'll talk now ! - Let her go . - Hit the road ! You got any doubts I couldn 't change your life right now ? Or even bring it to a close ? Better have a talk with him . He needs to grow up . Are you as good as your makeup ? The New Yorker said my nurse in Romeo and Juliet was the best since Edith Evans . I saw her do that . - You did ? - ln London , a long time ago . You 're not as primitive as I thought . Props ! It 's ugly , but it 'll do the job , to the base of the skull . What happened to you , Mr. Tyler ? How did you become so dangerous ? You make it back , and I 'll tell you my life story . I have a hunch that 's worth coming back for . On my signal , you pull the plug cut the power and kill the lights . This whole operation is staged around you . A star at last ! Let 's go . Steven and Diana are arriving soon . I want everything perfect . Pardon me . Watch where you 're going . Stop ! - Do I know you from someplace ? - No . I 'm just one of the help . I guess it 's not that important . Carry on . - I hope Ruby makes it . - She 'll be fine . You ! Woman ! How did you open the elevator ? That 's off-limits . Well , I have approval . They told me to give it a special cleaning for Steven and Diana . Make it spotless . - Let me see your authorization . - I have it here . Why , it 's down here . Hurry up , old woman . We 're almost down . - Where 's the old woman ? - Sir ? The old woman . The cleaning lady . I have no idea . - I 'm in position . - All right , it 's almost here . Get ready , Ruby . Okay . Hit Martin in the leg first . When he goes down , that 's our signal . From this distance , I could cut him in half . Any more than a flesh wound and you get the same . Okay , Gooder . Lights ! You should be terminated for this blunder ! You are a spy . Who , me ? I was just down here working , when all of a sudden ... No , no , no . You 're lying . I saw you . You 're coming with me . - I do know you . - Yes , you do know me . You were lying to me . Did you think you could outsmart me ? - You 're coming with me ... - And be a hero ? Let me go , Daniel . Daniel , I 've known you all your life . You were such a good boy . You couldn 't change to be so without honor . I don 't believe it . Wait a minute . Stop . I said , stop . I 'm warning you . Stop ! Our life in this world is short and often painful . Its full meaning is rarely made clear to us . I daresay none of us here will live as fully or die as heroically as Ruby did . Her loss is a grievous one . It wounds us to the heart . We must find the strength to go on the strength to prevail over this cruel and murderous foe . Let 's all re-dedicate ourselves to that task in Ruby 's memory . Now , please , all join me . Let 's share a moment of silence pay our last respects to our fallen comrade . - You all right ? - Yeah . - What 's your name ? - Sean . Sean Donovan . I know somebody who 'll be very happy to see you . Martin got word to me that in 30 days , no water will be left in Los Angeles . So unless we blow up this pumping station California will be one big desert . I 'm not ready to trade my ride in for a camel . Everyone freeze ! The slightest movement and we shoot ! This little gizmo makes your larynx reverberate , mimicking their sound . We 've only got a few of them . Are you always this dramatic , Mr. Tyler ? I get people 's attention so I don 't have to repeat myself . We 'll test them at the pump station and see if they fool the visitors as easily as they fool us . You and her ? This is reconnaissance , not a picnic . - You 're out of line . - We can 't trust her . She thinks like a lizard now . Relax ! I 'm sorry , Julie . As much as we hate to admit it , the man could have a point . I led this unit for a long time before Mr. Tyler showed up . I 've refused to step down because he 's paranoid . I 'm okay . Tell us about the chamber . Tell us what you went through and what you told them . I said nothing . Ruby 's gone . How many more must die before you find out who she really is ? Ruby gave her life for me and I can never repay that . If I walk away now , she died in vain . I have no intention of doing that . I say we stick with Julie . I trust her a lot more than I trust him . - Yeah . - Yeah , he 's right . Me too . We came this far . We should go all the way . That goes for all us . Tyler , we need you . We need your expertise . So are you in , or are you out ? We 're in ... for now . Passes . Engineering division . Checking for faults in the structure . All right . I 'm all right ! You sure sound funny . Look at that ! They 're sucking it dry . - Let 's go down and mingle . - Okay . It 's on a 24-hour cycle . It swallows a million gallons a second ! You ! What are you doing ? - Checking for faults . - Move on . Move back . I wanna get a shot . Take a shot of that panel right there . Where 's everyone ? At dinner , I guess . It 's so strange , being alone here . I like that . - Mike , I 'm really frightened . - Why ? - I 'm afraid they 're winning . - They won 't get that far . Not unless I help them and don 't know I 'm doing it . What 's wrong ? I feel funny . I 'm not in control . I 've been using my left hand . - I 'm beginning to think ... - You 're not converted . The fact that you have doubts proves it . - I don 't know . - I do . You 're a little shaken . Nobody could go through that and not have scars . But you beat them . You 're gonna be just fine . I just wish it would all stop , at least for a little while . I ... I 'll keep an eye on you for a while if you think that 'll help . IKind of getting the idea you 've been doing that anyway . - You have ? - Yeah . I didn 't wanna push anything , you know ? Because ... That 's the first time I 've ever seen you stumble . It looks okay . You 've had minor surgery . Your body temperature 's dropping . Do you understand ? It 's Robin ! She 's convulsing ! - What 'll you give her ? - Compazine . - I know this . - What ? You just had surgery . You can 't get up . Help me . I can remedy her . Please ... What 's the matter ? - Get away from her ! - He 's trying to help . This is common among our females as they near their time . We 'll be in that tunnel . That laser is a million volts . It 'll be off for 12 minutes while they switch grids . Anyone inside when the laser goes back on will be turned into a charcoal briquette . Watch . No , no . No . No ! No ! That was a kid who wandered onto the grounds by mistake . We have 12 minutes to go , set the charges , and leave . - Explain the explosives problem . - They 're experimental . Experimental ? That 's terrific , good . I 've worked on this a while . The kinks are nearly out . - What 's wrong with regular explosives ? - Won 't make it . The machinery is too big . We 'd need a trailerful to dent it . We needed something special . This is it . Similar to a nitroglycerin . So don 't shake it like a martini . And here 's the kicker : The stuff is stable only between 60 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit . So much as one degree over or under that ... You 're history . This stuff will blow you into next week . - Do you trust her ? - Damn right . That 's good , because she 's your partner . - You all loaded up ? - Yeah . - Hi there . - Hi . Are we talking today ? Sure , we 're partners . - That 's not what I mean . - What do you mean ? - I miss you . - Yeah ? I miss you too . Guess I acted like a real jerk , huh ? I guess you did . You don 't have to agree so fast . It just hurt real bad because I 'm so crazy about you . I 'm crazy about you too . - Yeah ? - Yeah . Come on , let 's move it . You , uh crazy enough to marry me ? I guess so . I said , move it ! Hold on . Soon as we get back , okay ? Sooner the better . Watch your lady friend , Gooder . I still don 't trust her . Five seconds . Four ... three ... two ... one . Let 's go . - Eleven minutes , 55 seconds . - I hear that . - Watch your temperature . - Go . Check your gauges . Go . - Hot in here or am I scared ? - Seventy degrees . Make it fast . Or get blown to kingdom come . - Seventy-one . Let 's go someplace else . - No . I can play hardball with Tyler any time . Let 's go . Got eight minutes ! - This stuff is bubbling . - IKeep working . - What 's your temperature reading ? - I got 72 degrees . They 're on the catwalk ! Elias ! Let 's go . Now ! All right , that 's three minutes . We 're out of here . Come on , move it ! It 's 72 degrees . Stop ! - You 're gonna blow us sky-high . - Just one more . Okay , let 's go . Two minutes . - Mike ! - There they are . Go ! Mark ! Get out of here ! Cover me . I 'm never gonna make it . Now go ! Get her out of here . I 'll cover you . No ! I 'm in . How is she ? She 'll be all right , in a while . They were planning to get married . - I didn 't know . - Nobody did . It 's a big mistake , making plans like that the way things are . With nothing to live for , people lose hope . I 'd like to get out of this with my son , lead a normal life . I want you to be part of it . Oh , Mike I can 't even think of that now . Let 's walk . I don 't even know what hand to use . I have to concentrate to use my right hand . I don 't even know where I am , day to day . They screwed me up so bad I don 't trust myself anymore . - lt 'll pass . - No , it won 't pass . Tyler was right . I should just step down before I really hurt somebody . - Julie ... - Mr . Donovan ! Come quick . Hurry ! We interrupt this program to repeat a special bulletin . We repeat , this is a special bulletin . This boy wandered into our headquarters searching for his daddy . If anyone can help find his father , we 'd be most grateful . Any information at all would be greatly appreciated . Thank you . We 'll repeat this bulletin every hour . - Mike ? - He 's my son . We now return to our regular program . It was a good ploy , don 't you think ? After your failures , you 've nothing to crow about . Besides , his greatest value is entirely my doing . I didn 't want this , Gooder . I know . Move headquarters . I don 't plan to talk , but ... - Okay . - I know a place . IKeep it simple . We have sharpshooters , cut you down to wallet-size . You 're loud and arrogant . You must be " the Fixer . " Never mind who I am . Send the boy , now ! We 'll get you back . IKeep an eye on them . Watch real close . You look good . But you need a haircut . - Dad ... - I 'll be okay . Better go . Wait outside . You don 't mind this weather , do you ? - Only at night . - You must not be a night owl . - lt 's good to have a friend . - I 'm Oliver . - I don 't have good news . - What is it ? You need an armed assault to escape , which would jeopardize all of us . We can 't chance it for one man . - I 'm sorry . - I understand . I don 't think you do . Diana 's developed a powerful truth serum that 's foolproof against your people . And I know enough to expose both your Fifth Column and our resistance . Then you have to kill me . We 're not executioners . The choice must be your own . I 'm sorry , there 's no other way . We can 't let you die without confessing . Can we , Mr. Donovan ? Do you believe in truth ? Depends on who I hear it from . What color is your hair ? - Blue . - Really ? What color is your hair , Mr. Donovan ? Brown . Yes . A lovely shade of brown . Tell me , Mr. Donovan , the Fifth Column you know some of them . Who is your contact ? Martin . I know how you feel . But he 'll be back . He 'll find a way . Her water broke . She 's in labor . - Help me with her . - Look at the color . On your side , sweetheart . There you go . That 's right . Lean back . Now breathe like we taught you . In , out . Concentrate on your breathing . We need Willie . In , out . In , out . That 's a good girl . In , out . There you go . In , out . This is a way out . - Come on , come on . - I gotta sit down , I gotta sit down . All right , but just for a minute . The drugs will wear off soon . - How long are these tunnels ? - Bigger than New York 's subway . It won 't stop them from catching us . Let 's go . - Martin . - Huh ? Sorry I couldn 't keep my mouth shut . I really fixed it for you . It 's not your fault . It was just a matter of time . She 's still at five centimeters . I don 't like her vital sign readings . We 'll do a cesarean . IKnow what that is ? I 'll do a spinal block . Robert , Harmy , Willie , I need help . Father , can you get the surgical packs ? We 're ready . Scalpel . Clamp . Another clamp . - How is she ? - She 's all right . Go ahead . Okay. we 're going in . It 's a girl . - ls she normal ? - As far as I can see , she 's beautiful . - Can I see her ? - Yes . There you go , Grandpa . Oh , Robin . She 's beautiful . - Julie ! - Give her a sedative . Oh , my God ! I think we 're having twins . - What is it ? - I don 't know . Oh , my God !

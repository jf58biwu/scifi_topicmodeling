 ALL : ( CHANTING ) Hecate , Hecate , Hecate , Hecate , Hecate , Hecate . PRIESTESS : All I seek , with the voice of Hecate , our greatest goddess . I bring joy on earth . Still not there . Should 've liked to talk to her before I go . What 's the rush ? I thought you weren 't going till after Christmas . No , they want me a month earlier . One of their other lecturers has gone sick . That 's not what they 're saying in the village . Oh ? Why does Moreton Harwood think I 'm off ? I heard that woman in the post office ... What 's she called , Grigson ? - Gregson . - I heard her telling someone you were being spirited away . - Spirited away ? - That 's what she said . It 's my guess , Lavinia , dear , it 's all due to that letter you wrote to the Standard . - Which one ? - The one about witchcraft . Oh , pooh ! That had to be said . I 'm a scientist , you know . I can 't tolerate that sort of mumbo jumbo . Not on my own doorstep . It 's all very well for some . They 're very superstitious round here . You 're a comparative newcomer . Even Howard has to tread very gently . He has enough difficulty keeping his staff , as it is . Bill Pollock must be very pleased you 're going . Why should he be ? Gives him a free hand with the business , doesn 't it ? Bill Pollock may be part owner , but he doesn 't run the place . Oh , he 's all right on the selling side , but it 's George Tracey who runs the market now . - He gives me the creeps . - George ? - Hmm . - He 's all right , he 's a very clever man . Oh , no . Leave that one , please , that 's not to go . ( SIGHS ) That 's it . That 's the last . Thank you . That is typical of my niece . This was delivered to her so long ago , I can 't remember . I had to bring it with me when I came here . - Whatever 's in it ? - I have no idea . I told her about it often enough , but she 's like a butterfly , never in one place long enough to lick a stamp . If only I knew where she was . When is she due here ? Oh , Friday week , the 1 8th . - And your nephew ? Brendan ? - Oh , he 's my ward . - Breaks up soon , doesn 't he ? - Yes , next Friday . This is his first visit here . He can always come to me , you know . Muck in with my lot . That 's sweet of you , Juno , but it 's all settled now . I rang him yesterday . He 's going to stay on at the school till Sarah Jane collects him . - I 'm looking forward to meeting her . - You 'll like her . Miss Smith . I 'm Tracey . George Tracey . I work for Miss Lavinia . - Is my aunt not here ? - She 's in America . But she wasn 't due to go until after Christmas . She went last Sunday week . She wouldn 't go without telling me . I know she wrote to you . I haven 't been home . I was delayed . I 've been abroad . Something about a cable to Reuters . That 's who I was working for . Well , anyway , welcome to Moreton Harwood . Thank you . Here are the keys . That one 's to the front door , the others have got tabs . If you want anything , I 'm in the cottage , just past the market garden . Thank you very much . You 're welcome . International , please . Yes , this is Moreton Harwood 778 . Could you tell me if a cable has been sent from this number during the past two weeks ? Will you ? Thank you . LAVINIA : It 's to be hoped , dear , that you will at last find a feverish moment to open this . It was crammed into the attic at Croydon for years , and I 've just disinterred it again here . ( PHONE RINGING ) 778 . Yes ? There hasn 't . Well , thank you very much . Goodbye . ( DOORBELL CHIMING ) Hello . I 'm Peter Tracey . My dad sent me over . He thought you might be able to use this . It 's a cup of tea . Oh , how very kind . Thank you , Peter . - Are you coming in ? - I better get back . ( PHONE RINGING ) Yes , all right . Fine . Thanks again . Can you close the door ? Thank you . 778 . - Sarah . - Who 's that ? Brendan . Brendan . Look , I was just going to phone you . I 'm sorry , I got held up . Well , I 've only just arrived . Look , it 's a bit late now . I 'll come for you tomorrow . - If you do , I 'll be frozen solid . - What ? I 'm in a phone box at the station . - What station ? - Chipping Norton . - Look , what 's the idea ? - I got fed up waiting . Oh , you got fed up waiting . I 'd take a taxi but I haven 't got enough money . No , no . I 'm on my way . - Thanks . - Hmm . He got fed up waiting . Can 't wait to meet him . What did she say exactly ? - Aunt Lavinia ? - Well , who else ? Well , you could 've meant Matron . - When did she phone ? - The day before we broke up . All she said was that I 'll have to wait at school for a week , until you pick me up . - Nothing else ? - No . Nothing about the reason for going off suddenly like that ? - Maybe they wanted her earlier . - Just before Christmas ? The Americans don 't go much on Christmas , do they ? I think it 's very odd . She 's all right , isn 't she ? How would I know ? I 've been abroad for the last fortnight . - Are you home for good now ? - Here ? Yes . Good . What 's good about it ? Well , I was hoping to persuade Aunt Lavinia to let me go to the local comprehensive here . Oh , were you ? Well , start persuading me . I 'm here to write a book , not be a surrogate mum . I 'm old enough to look after myself . Don 't you like it at Wellington ? I think it 's great but I don 't like boarding . Aunt Lavinia 's got a better library . ( CHUCKLING ) What do you know about market gardening ? - Absolutely nothing . - Oh . But Travis ' father 's in the business . He says it 's very scientific these days . And I 'm taking three extra O Levels . Additional Maths , Physics and Biology . Well , watch it , boy . Watch it . ( DOG GROWLING ) Jasper , sit ! ( LAUGHS ) Hello , hello . My name 's Bill Pollock . I 'm your aunt 's partner . Yes , Commander . We met two years ago . Yes , we did . I thought you might not remember . Oh , this is Brendan Richards , my aunt 's ward . - How do you do , boy ? - How do you do , sir ? You will forgive the intrusion , won 't you ? I was told you were here , so I lit a fire . How very kind . I got used to just popping in when your aunt was here . The back door was always open . - You live at Kingswood , don 't you ? - Well , I did but last year your aunt let me rent the eastern wing here . It was much better for the business . No ! Man 's best friend must know his place . The most endearing trait in a dog is total obedience . Oh , I couldn 't agree more . Do please ... - How is the business ? - Couldn 't be worse . We 've had two terrible years . If it doesn 't pick up next year , we 'll go bankrupt . Brendan says it 's all scientific these days . - Does he now . - Yes , sir . - I 've a friend whose father says that ... - Yeah , I 've got friends , too , lad . It isn 't all science . It 's common sense and experience . Mostly experience . Your aunt was quite happy to leave it to me . Oh , as I shall be . Make no mistake . - I 've work of my own to do . - Oh , capital . Actually , though , I 'm a bit worried about her , going off like this , suddenly , without a word . It 's not like her . She tried hard to reach you , I know that . I think she sent a wire . Well , not by telephone , I 've checked . You 'd better check with Lilly Gregson down at the post office . Do you happen to know who your aunt 's hosts are in America ? No . I think it was arranged by her agent . - Well , there you are . - Yes , but I 'm not sure which . Oh , well , somebody 's bound to know . ( PHONE RINGING ) Excuse me . - 778 . - Miss Smith ? - Yes ? - This is Juno Baker . I am a friend of your aunt 's . - Oh , hello . - Hello , my dear . I heard you 'd arrived . All 's well , I hope ? - Fine , thank you . - Good . I wondered if you 'd like to come over for a drink a little later . That 's if you 're not too exhausted . Well , that 's very kind of you . You can meet some of the locals and we 're only just a little bit up the road . Really , that 's most kind of you . - Would you let me think it over ? - Of course , my dear , don 't feel pressed . Just come if you feel like it . We 're at the lodge . Anyone will direct you . Yes , well , thank you very much , Mrs Baker . - Goodbye . - Goodbye . - She 'll come . - Good . Well , if you want my opinion , don 't go . Keep away from them . Howard Baker is our biggest competitor . He 's so big , that what he loses on the swings , he gains on the roundabouts . And we haven 't got any roundabouts . - Well , I 'll let you get on with it . - Right . I 'll give you one other bit of advice . Keep the back door locked . - What 's this ? - Precisely what I intend to find out . Aunt Lavinia said she 's had it for ages , stuck away in the attic at Croydon . - Well , what is it ? - I 've no idea . Ooh ! Whatever it is , it 's very heavy . - Well , let 's lift this . - Oh . Pull . ( SARAH LAUGHING ) It looks just like a dog , a metal dog . It 's even got a nametag . There 's nothing on it . It 's got ears , tail . - It 's a mechanical dog . - No legs . No . Sort of wheels . - What do you think it does ? - We could try asking it . Chump . You 'll be taking it for a walk next . - K9 : Mistress . - Don 't muck about . - It wasn 't me . - K9 : I spoke , mistress . - What ? - I am K9 , Mark III . - K9 , Mark III ? - Affirmative . Oh , K9 . Brendan , stop honking ! Where ... - Where are you from , K9 ? - K9 : From the Doctor . - From the Doctor ? - Affirmative . You can 't mean , " the Doctor " ? My precise meaning , mistress . A gift to you . Oh , Doctor , you didn 't forget . - Who is the Doctor ? - Affirmative . He 's a ... Oh , he 's a very , very great friend of mine . How is he , K9 ? I may call you K9 ? - It is my designation , mistress . - Well , how is he ? K9 : No available data . What is the Earth year ? 1 981 , December 1 8th . The Doctor last spoke in 1 9 78 Earth years . He said , " Give Sarah Jane Smith my fondest love . " Tell her I shall remember her always . " Thank you , K9 . - You 're a computer ? - Affirmative . - And a robot ? - Affirmative . Just look at that . He 's fantastic . Negative . An efficient machine . - What a find . Tri-Sec bus driver ? - Affirmative . Bus driver ? Oh , bus is a microchip distributing data throughout a motherboard . - Oh . - And a UART ? - Affirmative . - What 's that ? BOTH : Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter . SARAH : Thank you . - Nuclear battery ? - Affirmative . - Self-charging ? - Naturally . And I 'll bet he 's got a holographic memory . - Affirmative . - I knew it . Go on , surprise me . Well , you see , there 's this hunk of crystal and it 's so microscopic they need a laser beam to scan it . - Right , K9 ? - Affirmative . Well , in effect it means he 's got a ... An integrated memory . - Like the human brain . - Better . - Well , quicker . - Quicker and better . No , no , boys . No arguing . It 's bound to be way over my head . - I wonder what the Doctor would do . - Mistress ? Oh . Yes , well ... My aunt , K9 , she left here suddenly a couple of weeks ago , and she 's not been in touch . And I got this feeling , intuition , there 's something wrong . What would ... What would you do ? - Insufficient data , mistress . - Oh . Oh , well . Curiosity , cause of annihilation of feline species but also only means to human knowledge . That 's good . Isn 't that good ? - That does it . - What ? - I am going out . - Where ? I don 't know . I 'll indulge my curiosity at the post office . Oh , I imagine you two will be able to amuse yourselves without me ? - You bet . - Affirmative . I 've been closing early Fridays for years . I 've just made myself a cup of tea . Would you like one ? Oh , I 'd love one . Thank you . Well , sit you down . Make yourself at home . Thank you . Did you want anything special ? Yes , I wanted to send a cable . No need to come here to do that . You got the telephone , haven 't you ? - Well , there was something else . - Aah . Did my aunt send me a telegram before she left ? Through you , I mean . She was never near me for well over a fortnight . Didn 't even drop in to say goodbye . Not like her . Thank you . - How about horticulture ? - Data on horticulture available . Oh , great . I 'll get a pencil . Graphic notation unnecessary . Data printout available . Terrific . All you know then . Available data considerable . Suggest specifics . All right . Soil analysis . For that , soil sample required . - Of course . You are clever , K9 . - Affirmative . Be back in a moment . Stay . Good boy . ( K9 YELPS ) Absent minded , was she , your aunty ? I don 't think so . Well , not really . A lot of clever people are , I 've found . Say they 're gonna do a thing and then forget about it completely . Too much going on in here . You 're clever , too , I hear . Work for a newspaper . I did . Your aunty would write to the Standard , letters and that . Yes ? - Upset some people . - Did she ? Why ? Wrote about witchcraft . Witchcraft ? They 're a bit sensitive about that round here . It 's traditional , you see . A lot of people here about still believe that the black art makes the crops grow . " The black art " ? Well , that 's what your aunty called it . Upset a lot of people . Are you saying it 's still going on ? - What ? - The black art . Oh , no . All that stopped years and years ago . But that doesn 't stop people believing in it . Country people . - Do you want more tea ? - No , thank you , Mrs Gregson . Call me Lilly . Your aunty did . - Did you say you wanted to send a cable ? - Yes , I did . - I 'll get you a form . - Thank you . ( DOOR CLOSES ) Sarah ? Sarah , look . K9 has done a complete soil analysis . What 's more , comprehensive chemical treatment for healthy advanced yield . - Nothing about witchcraft ? - What ? Never mind . Did you find out anything about Aunt Lavinia ? - No , not a lot . - Mmm . I think I 'll accept that invitation . - What invitation ? - My neighbours , the Bakers ? I 'm going over there for a drink . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) Fruit cup . Not as innocuous as it looks . Give her time , my dear . Lavinia will be in touch with you when she 's cleared her mental decks and not before . I know her of old . Yes , how long have you known my aunt ? Mmm , since she moved here about two years , isn 't it ? We natives are usually rather reserved with foreigners , but I must say , we took to her at once . I 'll not deny it was because she was something of a celebrity . - Was ? - Still is , my dear , of course . Knock that back . It 'll make you less prickly . I 'm sorry , I didn 't realise I was being prickly . - It 's just , I can 't help feeling ... - Of course , you can 't . - You need a diversion . - Yes . You 're a journalist . There 's somebody here you ought to meet . Excuse me , please . Come along , dear . Excuse me , thank you . Henry , there 's somebody here I 'd like you to meet . Sarah Jane Smith . Henry Tobias . - Delighted . - How do you do ? Henry is the editor of the local Standard . - You have five heuristic interfaces . - Affirmative . And you can rely on your memory and your logic gates . You don 't need updating from time to time from a piggyback board ? Affirmative . Affirmative . - Affirmative , affirmative ? - To both questions , affirmative . Aah . ( CLUNKS ) Sarah ? Sarah ? BRENDAN : Ah ! Oh ! ( SCREAMING ) Thanks , K9 . What did you do ? I rendered aggressor insensible . Suggest he is pinioned . - Let me go . - Who are you ? You 've got to get away from here . You and the girl . You 've got to get away . - Why ? Why did you attack me ? - Please , let me go . Get away from here before they get you . - Who 's they ? - Get away . Just get away . Go now . Now ! ( K9 BEEPING ) ( CRASHING ) What was that ? You could call it a brouhaha . That 's all . Your aunt wrote a letter complaining that she 'd found evidence that black magic rites had been performed . The correspondence page was quite lively for three weeks . But I 'm sure it did your aunt no personal harm . You needn 't have printed that letter . No , but it amused me and I thought it might amuse other people . Nobody takes that sort of thing seriously any more . - They don 't ? - No . - Sorry to butt in . I 've got to go out . - Oh , Howard . It won 't be for long . I can 't avoid it . That 's what you always say . Go on then , off you go . Off , off , off . Try the Cornell University Press . Oh , I 'm sorry . If you 're still worried about your aunt , the Cornell University Press in New York . Yes , thank you . I 'm hoping to get a reply to a cable I sent today to her agent there . If ever I can be of help , - don 't hesitate . - Oh , thank you . BRENDAN : It wasn 't your fault , K9 . - Garden goblin not in my memory . - Of course not . It was the goddess Hecate 's familiar . A dog ... A dog belching fire ! It got Peter . It got my son . I swear . I swear by Arianrhod . Peter , you led it here . Curse you ! You led it here ! They knocked me out but I 've got away . - You led it here . - What ? - The dog . - What dog ? I swear . I swear . I locked the back door . I know I did . And you didn 't find out who he was ? He wouldn 't say . He just kept saying that we had to get away from here . What did he look like ? He was dark , about 20 , he looked a bit like a gypsy . Did K9 see him ? He did more than that . He clobbered him . - You should have seen it . - Oh ! Well done , K9 . Congratulations unnecessary , mistress . I 'll see to this in the morning . There is nothing we can do tonight , except lock every door and window in this place . Come on . - Good morning . - SARAH : Morning . Did you hear anything of this last night ? - I was out . Over at the Bakers . - Ah . You didn 't happen to see a large white dog anywhere here , did you ? - Or over by the chapel ? - No . George says a dog did this . Yeah , well , if I catch him I 'll ... I 'll let Jasper here tear him to bits . My guess is whoever attacked Brendan did this . - What ? - Brendan was attacked last night by two men . - Is this true , boy ? - Do you doubt my word ? No , no , of course . Don 't be so touchy . - What happened ? - Well , Sarah was out . I heard a noise in the hall and I went out there and they jumped me . I managed to fight off one and the other ran away . - Do you know who it was ? - No . Would you be able to recognise him again ? BRENDAN : Oh , yes . Good . Good . We must tell the police . I already have . They 're sending someone over to take a statement . Oh , good . It 's been a bit frightening for you , lad . Something new around here . - Was there anything missing ? - No , no . Good . Well , that 's something , I suppose . Then let 's just hope that the police turn up with something . And that the insurance company coughs up . I mean , there 's up to 500 quid 's worth of damage done here . - What do you grow in this area ? - Not for growing . It 's gonna be a protective tunnel . With shrubs and semi-hardy plants to keep the frost off them . It 's a pH of about nine , I 'd say . Isn 't that too alkaline ? Oh ? What would you suggest ? Three hundred kilos of ammonium sulphate ? No , not as much as that . Over there , you got a pH of four . Over there it 's six , over there it 's as much as eleven . There 's more to growing than science . Now , I 've got my work to do . You hurt George 's feelings , I 'm afraid . There 's not much he doesn 't know about care of the soil . Don 't you make the mistake , young fellow , my lad , that everything is in books . Science doesn 't control the elements . At least , not yet . You know that apple orchard of ours ? Well , last September , just as we were due to pick , we had a 1 3-second hailstorm . Thirteen seconds . Stripped the lot . 7,000 quid . I stood and watched it happen . - Over 500 quid a second . - How dreadful . - But you were insured . - You must be joking . Insured ? An act of God . Ah , here 's your copper . You better be off . - See you later . - Yes . Come on , Jasper . We 've got to go dog hunting . - You 'll do as you 're told . - I can 't . You haven 't got any choice ! The boy knows you . You 've nothing to lose and everything to gain . And what are you going to do with him ? - None of your concern . - Yes , it is . He 's nothing . He means nothing . - He 's only a kid . - Yes . Now , you get him . If I get caught , they 'll put me inside . You mean you 'll get yourself caught ? You 'll be safe inside ? You know better than that . Hecate will seek you out . She 'll seek me out . And her revenge will be terrible . You know that . ( SOBBING ) - Go on , off you go . - Why ? And make sure I 've locked everything up . You don 't have to remind me . Good night . Good night . - Good night , K9 . - K9 : Reciprocated . Psst ! Psst ! Hmm . - That 's interesting . - K9 : Mistress . Some books on witchcraft . SARAH : Brendan ! Brendan ! - His bed 's not been slept in . - K9 : Mistress ? It 's dead . Right . I 'm pretty sure I know who it was who attacked Brendan . K9 : I must accompany . Mistress ! There 's no one there . Somehow I didn 't think there would be . Come on . K9 : I must remain , mistress . - Leave you here ? - Affirmative . - What have you got in mind ? - Stratagem , mistress . Will report after dark . - I suppose you know what you 're doing ? - Correct . Well , I 'll get back to you tonight . Miss Smith . Good morning . - SARAH : Good morning . - Good morning , Commander . Good morning . Brendan Richards , the boy who was attacked on Friday night ... - I 'm sorry Miss Smith , we ... - He 's now missing . - Missing ? - Disappeared . And I believe that a man called Peter ... - Steady ... - I 'm sorry , Commander . I believe that a man called Peter Tracey has something to do with it . SERGEANT WILSON : I 'll call you back . The boy who was attacked the other night . I heard . Are you sure ? - I 'm quite sure . - How long has he been missing ? Since last night . His bed wasn 't slept in . - Did he go out perhaps ? - No , I 'm sure he didn 't . Any evidence of a break-in ? Anything like that ? SARAH : Nothing . What makes you think Peter Tracey is involved ? Well , doesn 't he fit Brendan 's description ? This is a tricky one , Commander . Peter got a suspended sentence six months ago . Housebreaking . In a sense , he 's in his father 's custody . - Then what are we waiting for ? - Peter 's also missing . His father came here last night . Look , what 's going on here ? My aunt goes off mysteriously , then Brendan 's attacked , then he disappears . Now , what is the matter with this place ? Now , try not to worry , Miss Smith . We 'll put out a general alert . The wisest thing for you to do is stay by the telephone . But even that 's out of order . I want to talk to George Tracey . He knows something about all this . Hello , my dear . - Have you heard from your aunty yet ? - No , not yet . Oh , well , never mind . No news is good news . If I don 't see you before , Merry Christmas . And to you . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) George ? George ? He 's not here . He 's probably out looking for his son . Unless , of course , he may have gone to see his mother in Cirencester . He usually does on a Sunday . He 'll be back . - K9 ? - Mistress . You 're very welcome to come and wait with me . It 's very kind of you but ... I think I 'll have a go at some work . It might help . All right , if you like . I 'll report your telephone and I 'll call round if I hear anything . Thank you . Oh , Brendan . Where the devil are you ? SERGEANT WILSON : Where is the boy ? GEORGE : I 'll not tell you . I can guess . This is madness . It 's criminal . - It 's survival . - No . Not at that price . You 're bound . There hasn 't been a human sacrifice since 1 891 . You 're bound by your oath . I 'm a policeman . Hecate 's laws are higher . She sent her familiar to warn us . The white dog . Unless she 's appeased , she will destroy us all . Sacrifice ? Brendan in great danger , mistress . Come on , K9 , let 's go . ( ANIMAL CRYING OUT ) ( TWIGS SNAPPING ) Who 's there ? Is anyone there ? ( TWIGS SNAPPING ) ( BLEATING ) Witches ? George and Vince Wilson witches ? You must believe me . - You said you actually heard them ? - Yes . You don 't seem very sure . You have simply got to believe me . All right , all right , all right . Now , they took Wilson to the hospital , did they ? Yes . - What did they say ? - That it looked like shock . No , I mean , the police . I mean , you 've just told the police what you 've told me . Yes . Well , I don 't think they believed me . It 's hardly surprising , is it ? - A police sergeant a witch . - But you do ? I 've got to , haven 't I ? I mean , you just told me . - Oh , thank you . - Yes , all right , all right . Come on . But you 've always wanted to be let in . - No ! - But you 've been chosen ! No ! - You will be initiated tonight . - No ! But it must be complete for the solstice . No ! Then be sure , you 'll go like Vince Wilson to everlasting fire . No , there 's nobody . Nothing more we can do tonight . But come first light , we 'll get to the bottom of this . Come on , I 'll take you back and we 'll lock every door in the place . ALL : ( CHANTING ) Hecate ! Hecate ! Hecate ! Hecate ! PRIESTESS : I invoke thee and call upon thee , oh , mighty mother of all , bringer of all fruitfulness by seed and root , by stem and bud , by leaf and flower and fruit , by life and love do we invoke thee . Descend upon the body of thy servant and priestess . ALL : ( CHANTING ) Hecate ! Hecate ! Hecate ! Hecate ! And now he 's gone . Well , I 've no one else to turn to . My dear , you were quite right to come here . But Bill is always busy in the mornings . He 'll be about somewhere . - He can 't have disappeared . - But he has . I 'd arranged to meet him . All the doors were open , his coat there . HOWARD : Here , try this . Oh ! You don 't believe a word of this , do you ? My dear , you 're upset . Yes , of course , I 'm upset . The police politely suggesting I 'm nuts and you humouring me . I didn 't imagine it . I 'm compos mentis and an experienced journalist . Well , of course you are . But there must be a rational explanation for all this . Am I being irrational ? HOWARD : Wilson died of a heart attack last night . Am I saying he didn 't ? My dear , black magic , witchcraft , it 's very romantic , but this is 1 981 . Aunt Lavinia found evidence . Relics . I 'm sure they 're found all over the country . You 're calling me a liar ! No , we 're not . Now ... Where were you when you overheard Tracey and Wilson ? Outside the Tracey cottage . - HOWARD : They were how far away ? - They were inside . Well then , isn 't it just possible you misheard part of what they had to say ? No , it is not possible . Darling , why don 't you go home and put your feet up . I 'll ring Dr Perry and ask him to drop in on you . Howard will find Bill for you and he 'll get your phone fixed . He 's not without some pull round here , you know . Yes . Thank you very much . K9 , I 'm at my wits end . I don 't know what to do . I don 't know what else I can do . I 'm able to assist , mistress . Require large scale map of the area . - What for ? - Is map available ? Yes . There 's an Ordnance Survey . K9 : Data , witchcraft in England assimilated . Primitive traditional belief in rural areas , cosmic forces control weather to secure crops . Occult ceremonies invoke such forces . Most important ceremony falls on winter solstice , December 22nd . That 's tomorrow . Here . K9 : Witch 's power increased by hallowed ground . - Churches . - Affirmative . What signifies a church ? Oblong or ball with a cross on top . K9 : All churches identified . A specific radius , please . - Say , five miles . - Better eight . Can you work out the quickest route to look at all of them ? - Affirmative . - Right . We 'll go now . - We 've got until tomorrow night . - Negative , mistress . December 22nd begins after midnight tonight . ( PHONE RINGING ) - Hello ? - My dear , I thought I 'd just check the telephone was working again . How are you feeling ? - Oh , a little better , thank you . - Good . I 've been talking to Howard and we don 't think you should be left on your own . Come to dinner . - Tonight ? - Yes , take your mind off things . And by then we might have some news for you . Oh , that 's very kind of you but , well , I 'm a bit tired . Oh , we won 't be late . We 'll have you tucked up in bed well before midnight . No , no , really , it 's more than kind of you but ... I think I 'd be very poor company . Very well , my dear . But if you should change your mind , we 'll be delighted to see you . Yes , thank you very much . Goodbye . Goodbye . Come on , K9 , let 's go . ( TYRES SCREECHING ) Could someone be trying to kill me , K9 ? A possibility , mistress . ( BUZZER ) Three down , five to go . Two more to go . It 's nearly 1 2 : 00 . K9 , what am I going to do ? - Significance of simple cross ? - Chapel . - Chapel ? - A sort of church . - Please be specific . - A private one . One with no parish . There is one at the manor . Oh ! ALL : ( CHANTING ) Hecate ! Hecate ! Hecate ! Hecate ! 1 1.57 , mistress . ( CHANTING ) Hecate ! Hecate ! Hecate ! Hecate ! 1 1.58 , mistress . ALL : ( CHANTING ) Hecate ! Hecate ! Hecate ! Hecate ! 1 1.59 , mistress . ALL : ( CHANTING ) Hecate ! Hecate ! Hecate ! Hecate ! ( WHISPERING ) Come on , K9 . ( K9 BEEPING ) 1 1.59 and 30 seconds , mistress . Hurry , mistress .

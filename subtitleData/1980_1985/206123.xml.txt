 'Max , it 's that time again . 'Time to slowly , painfully ease yourself back into consciousness . 'No , I 'm not a dream , 'although I 've been told I 'm a vision of loveliness . ' 'I 'm your faithful girl Friday , 'Bridey James , 'here with your wake-up call of today , Wednesday the 23rd . 'You got that ? Wednesday the 23rd . 'And I have a message . 'Remember your meeting this morning at 6 : 30 'with Shinji Kuraki of Hiroshima Video . 'This meeting is to take place at the Classic Hotel , Suite 17 . 'And needless to say , it 's your first of the day . 'Don 't you know anyone who works nine to five ? '0ver and out , Commander . ' 'Civic TV , the one you take to bed with you . ' Sweetie , open the door ! ( Woman ) Go away . Come on . You know I love you . For fuck 's sake , open the door ! I don 't wanna open the door . I wanna get out of this place ! For fuck 's sake , open the door ! You know I love you , you just gotta open the fucking door ! Well , I looked over the stills . I am interested , a little bit . How many shows you got ? 13 , with a possibility of another six if the sales go well . - You got cassettes ? - 0f course . - Hold it . Show me the last one . - ( Speaks Japanese ) Number 13 . You won 't understand . It 's set up in the first two . My audience won 't see the first two shows . Show me the last one . What do you think ? Can we get away with it ? Do we want to get away with it ? 0riental sex is a natural . I think it will get us an audience we never had before . I don 't like it . It 's not tacky enough . - Tacky enough for what ? - Tacky enough to turn me on . Too much class . Bad for sex . Maybe . I don 't know . It 's soft . There 's something too ... soft about it . I 'm looking for something that will break through . Something tough . ( Mechanism whirrs ) ( Electric motor humming ) ( Humming noise ) ( Electrical whining ) Hey , Harlan ... enough ? 0h . 0K . Here we go . It 'll come through on that . We only got about 53 seconds so keep your eyes open . They 've got an unscrambler scrambler , if you know what I mean . It sensed that we were unscrambling and automatically changed its code . What satellite is it coming from ? - Snooker , I think . - Country ? Er ... Assuming 53 seconds represents the period of delay , I 'd say somewhere ... in Malaysia ? - ( Electronic buzzing ) - 0K , here we go . This is it . ( Woman gasping ) There 's a wall behind her . What is that ? Clay ? Yeah . Wet clay . I think it 's electrified . - That 's it ? - That 's it . - Grotesque , as promised . - 0K ... - Can you hang a searcher on it ... ? - Already working on it . I was insulted when it just shrugged us off in a minute . Well , patron ... interested ? Yeah . Harlan , can you do something about these labels ? This is supposed to be a clandestine operation . Know what I mean ? Si , patron . You get a little nervous , even if you 've been doing it all your life . ( Woman ) 0h , for sure . That 's part of the excitement . Mm-hm . Do you smoke ? No , thanks . Just relax . 'And now , here it is - The Rena King Show . 'Guests are Max Renn , controversial president of Channel 83 , 'radio personality Nicki Brand 'and media prophet Professor Brian 0'Blivion . Take it away , Rena ! ' Max Renn , your television station offers its viewers everything from soft-core pornography to hard-core violence . Why ? It 's a matter of economics . We 're , uh , small . We have to give people something they can 't get anywhere else . And we do that . But don 't you feel such shows contribute to a social climate of violence and sexual malaise ? - And do you care ? - Certainly I care . I care enough to give my viewers a harmless outlet for their fantasies and their frustrations . As far as I 'm concerned , that 's a socially positive act . What about it , Nicki ? Is it socially positive ? We live in overstimulated times . We crave stimulation . We gorge ourselves on it . We always want more , whether it 's tactile , emotional or sexual . And I think that 's bad . Then why did you wear that dress ? - Sorry ? - That dress . It 's very stimulating . And it 's red . You know what Freud would say about it ? And he would have been right . I admit it . I live in a highly excited state of overstimulation . I 'd like to take you out to dinner . Professor 0'Blivion , do you think erotic and violent TV shows lead to desensitisation ? To dehumanisation ? ( Renn ) Is the microphone on ? 'The television screen has become the retina of the mind 's eye . ' - ( Renn and Brand talking ) - Yes . 'That 's why I refuse to appear on television , 'except on television . '0'Blivion is not the name I was born with . It 's my television name . 'Soon , all of us will have special names , 'names designed to cause the cathode-ray tube to resonate . ' Yes . Nicki ... - Is Max Renn a menace to society ? - I 'm not sure . He 's certainly a menace to me . When does the plot get going ? Who 's this black guy ? Is he a political prisoner ? There 's no plot . It just goes on like that for an hour . - Goes on like what ? - Like that . Torture , murder , mutilation . - We never leave that room ? - Nope . It 's a real sicko . For perverts only . It 's brilliant . There 's almost no production costs . You can 't take your eyes off it . It 's so realistic . Where do they get actors who can do this ? - Help me . I think he wants it . - It 's worth checking out . Did you have any trouble locking on to it ? Not after I realised the Malaysia delay was a plant . It 's not from Malaysia ? You cannot fool the prince of pirates for long . Harlan ... where is it coming from ? Pittsburgh . That 's in the USA . Pittsburgh ? Pittsburgh . 'Get professional help . ' 'It 's my sister , not me . ' 'It 's not your sister . It 's you , lover . 'Can 't you tellc Isn 't that why you called me ? 'You want help . You need help . ' You 're going insane . I can hear you disintegrating . - I 've got your number , haven 't I ? - ( Woman sobbing ) 'I hate my sister . 'I don 't want to . It 's ripping me up inside . 'But I do . I do . ' You call our Distress Center , the C-RAM Distress Center ? They 'll tell you where to get help , lover . And you need it . You need it now . - ' I will . I will . Thank you , Nicki . ' - ( Hangs up ) ( Man ) ' We 'll return to Nicki Brand 'and the Emotional Rescue Show in a moment . 'This is C-RAM in Toronto and we 've got the weather . ' - Got any porno ? - You serious ? Yeah . Gets me in the mood . - What 's this ? Videodrome ? - Torture . Murder . - Sounds great . - It ain 't exactly sex . Says who ? ( Screaming ) - God , I can 't believe it . - I 'll turn it off . No , no , no . It 's 0K . I can take it . - Can you get it any clearer ? - It 's a pirate tape . It 's scrambled . - I like it . - Yeah ? Yeah , it turns me on . Take out your Swiss Army knife and cut me here , just a little . I 'd say somebody 's beat me to it . I wonder how you get to be a contestant on this show . I don 't know . Nobody ever seems to come back next week . What did you say happened to your shoulder ? A friend . I think he 'd like Videodrome . You let somebody cut you ? Uh-huh . - What do you think ? - I don 't know . You wanna try a few things ? 0oh ... Max , thank God . Masha Borowczyk has been in your office for an hour . - What were you doing last night ? - I 'm not ready for this . Coffee . Cigarette . 0ffice . Masha . Go . She 's hot to trot . ( Woman , husky ) I call it Apollo And Dionysus . - Masha , does it ever get good ? - It 's all good . Darling , I am looking for something a lot more ... contemporary . I want to show people what 's really going on under the sheets . This stuff is too ... It 's too naive . It 's too sweet . Like you , darling . Well , it 's your market . Do you know a show called Videodrome ? - Video what ? - D-R-0-M-E . Videodrome . Like video circus , video arena . - You know it ? - No . It 's just torture and murder . No plot , no characters . Very , very realistic . I think it 's what 's next . - Then God help us . - - Better on TV than on the streets . - Excuse me . Arnold on line three . You interested in tracking it down ? - You 'll get the agent 's commission . - I 'm interested . Let me try . Max ... Did you ever think of producing your own show ? Right here . I could be your agent , worldwide . I could sell subterranean for you everywhere . - No , I don 't have the temperament . - But if you did ... What kind of show would you do ? I mean , for the subterranean market . Would you do Videodrome ? - Max ... - Mm-hm ? I 'm going away tomorrow for two weeks , on assignment . - Guess where . - LA ? - Pittsburgh . - ( Laughs ) Fabulous . Don 't stay in the sun too long . I heard it 's bad for the skin . Come on . Isn 't that where they make Videodrome ? Yeah . Why ? I 'm gonna audition . I was made for that show . Nobody on earth was made for that show . Hey , listen to me . Listen to me . I want you to stay away from it . Those weirdo video guys , they play rough . rougher than even Nicki Brand wants to play . Do you understand ? Sounds like a challenge . Got a cigarette ? It 's not a challenge . I swear . You know , in Brazil , Central America , making underground videos is considered a subversive act . They execute people for it . In Pittsburgh , who knows ? Max . Nicki , don 't ! Nicki , don 't . - Do you have a hangover ? - I stayed up late watching TV . You get in touch with our friend in Pittsburgh ? In a way . At a distance . - The subterranean grapevine . - And ? Max , Videodrome is something for you to leave alone . It is definitely not for public consumption . Channel 83 is a little small to be considered public . It is still too public . Do you understand me ? No . What 's the punch line ? I think it 's dangerous , Max , Videodrome . - What ? It 's Mafia ? They do business . - No , no , no . It 's more ... How can I say ? More political than that . - Come on , what are we talking about ? - Videodrome ... What you see on that show , it 's for real . It 's not acting . - It 's snuff TV . - I don 't believe it . So ... don 't believe . Why do it for realc It 's easier and safer to fake it . Because it has something that you don 't have , Max . It has a philosophy and that is what makes it dangerous . Whose philosophy ? There must be a name . Give me a name I can talk to . Masha , Masha , you know me . I stay away from the scary stuff . Max ... You are going to have to be nice to me for this . We can take a shower together , any time you say . I 'm sure you would be very beautiful but you 're a little older than I prefer . Thank you ... so much . Sell me a name . And I 'll make Apollo And Dionysus part of the package . - That hurts me , Max . - The world 's a shit-hole , ain 't it ? Yes , Max , it is . Brian 0'Blivion . That is the only name I have to give . Professor Brian 0'Blivion . Wait . Where are you going ? Come back here . Can 't I have a smoke and a cup of coffee ? They don 't serve coffee in there , it 's piss water . I don 't have to put up with this shit . Come on , step along . - Bianca 0'Blivion ? - Yes . I 'm Max Renn . I run Civic TV . I did a panel show with Professor 0'Blivion . The Rena King Show . 0h , yes . Your ideas were superficial . Violence , sex , catharsis . - My exact words . - What do you want ? I wanna talk with your father about a new twist in video . - I love the view . - You look like them , like one of Father 's derelicts . - It 's a style that 's coming back . - In their case , it 's not a style . It 's a disease caused by their lack of access to the cathode-ray tube . You think TV can help them ? Watching TV will help patch them back into the world 's mixing board . Absolutely . I guess you encourage Father 's derelicts to make home movies for the world 's mixing board . Professor 0'Blivion sends videos all over the world . - Is the Professor here ? - I am my father 's screen . 0nce you 've told me what this is about , he may send you a cassette . Which format would you like ? It 'll make conversation difficult . My father has not engaged in conversation for at least 20 years . The monologue is his preferred mode of discourse . Format ? Videodrome . Is that a Japanese configuration ? - You 've never heard of it ? - No . Then there have been serious gaps in your education . Videodrome . Mention it to your father . He may want to have a conversation . I love the view . 'Torture ... murder ... mutilation . ' ( Masha ) ' Videodrome . What you see on that show , it 's for real . ' ( Brand ) ' I 'm gonna audition . I was made for that show . ' ( Masha ) ' It has something that you don 't have , Max . 'It has a philosophy and that is what makes it dangerous . ' ( Knock at door ) ( Knock ) Hi . This is your wake-up cassette - and this came for you by courier ... - What did they say at C-RAM ? They said that Nicki Brand is not on assignment for them . She decided to take a month off . Don 't touch that ! Jesus , Max . You scared me . - What the hell 's wrong with you ? - I don 't know . I think I 'm getting a rash or something . What ? Are you all right ? I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to hit you . Hit me ? You didn 't hit me . No ? No , I know I didn 't hit you . I mean ... ( Sighs ) - Do you want me to stay here ? - Er ... You look awful . Can I get you something ? No . No , I 'm just ... Er ... I 'm ... ( Sighs ) I 'm exhausted . I was in a deep sleep and I 'm not out of it . I 'll set the timer , don 't worry . - You 're sure ? - I 'm sure . Thanks , Bridey . Tomorrow . That other cassette is from Brian 0'Blivion . I promised I 'd hand deliver it directly to you . Will you call me if you need me ? ( Woman sighing ) 'The battle for the mind of North America 'will be fought in the video arena , the Videodrome . 'The television screen is the retina of the mind 's eye . 'Therefore the screen is part of the physical structure of the brain . 'Therefore , whatever appears on the television screen 'emerges as raw experience for those who watch it . 'Therefore , television is reality 'and reality is less than television . ' - ( Snorts ) - ' Max ... 'I 'm so glad you came to me . 'I 've been through it all myself , you see . 'Your reality is already half video hallucination . 'If you 're not careful , it will become total hallucination . 'You 'll have to learn to live in a very strange new world . 'I had a brain tumour . And I had visions . 'I believe the visions caused the tumour , and not the reverse . 'I could feel the visions coalesce and become flesh , 'uncontrollable flesh . 'But when they removed the tumour , 'it was called Videodrome . 'I was the ... ' ( Choking ) I ... I ... 'was ... Videodrome 's ... 'first victim . ' But who 's behind it ? What do they want ? 'I want you , Max . 'You . 'Come to me . 'Come to Nicki . 'Come on . Don 't make me wait . 'Please . ( Brand breathing heavily ) 'I want you , Max . 'You . 'Come on . 'Come on . 'Come to me now . 'Come to Nicki . 'Don 't keep me waiting . Please . 'Please . number ( Cheesy game show theme ) 'Today , Lady Luck may smile on these four players 'and start them on the road to $ 12,000 ... ' A new group of people are coming in today , so tell the staff . Right . Exciting . Very lively . Careful . It bites . - You watched it ? - Yeah . It changed my life . I 'm not surprised . It 's dangerous . Because your father is involved with Videodrome ? More than that . It bites . Isn 't that what you said ? What kind of teeth do you think it has ? It triggered hallucinations . - I woke up with a headache . - First time ever ? - I 've been hallucinating since ... - What ? Since I first saw Videodrome . How did you come to be exposed to it ? A pirate satellite dish . An accident . I made some tapes ... - This is part of my own collection . - That tape 's just your father . The tone of the hallucinations is determined by the tone of the tape 's imagery . But the Videodrome signal , the one that does the damage , it can be delivered under a test pattern , anything . - Damage ? - The signal induces a brain tumour . It 's the tumour that creates the hallucinations . You let me watch it ? ! I expect them to come to me to hurt me . I thought it might be you . Now I realise you 're just another victim , like Father was . Where is your father ? I think I 'd better talk to him . He 's in there . I 'm afraid he 'll disappoint you . This is him . This is all that 's left . What are you talking about ? Brian 0'Blivion died quietly on an operating table 11 months ago . - The brain problem ? - The Videodrome problem . - You have it , too . - But he was on that panel show . 0n tape . He made thousands of them , sometimes three or four a day . I keep him alive as best I can . He had so much to offer . My father helped to create Videodrome . He saw it as part of the evolution of man as a technological animal . When he realised what his partners were going to use it for , he tried to take it away from them and they killed him , quietly . He became convinced that public life on television was more real than private life in the flesh . He wasn 't afraid to let his body die . ( Sighs ) Tell me about my Videodrome problem . My father knows much more about it than I do . Listen to him . Where 's Harlan ? He 's not in the lab . - I think he 's up in VTR . Max ... - Not now . - Harlan . - Si , patron ? Have you been hallucinating lately ? No . Should I be ? Yes , you should be . 'I believe that the growth in my head , 'this head , this one right here ... 'I think that it is not really a tumour , 'not an uncontrolled , undirected little bubbling part of flesh , 'but that it is , in fact , a new organ , 'a new part of the brain . 'I think that massive doses of Videodrome signal 'will ultimately create a new outgrowth 'of the human brain , 'which will produce and control hallucination 'to the point that it will change human reality . 'After all , there is nothing real outside our perception of reality , 'is there ? ( Laughs ) 'You can see that , can 't you ? ' ( Crockery smashes ) ( Phone ) - ( Man ) ' Max Renn ? ' - Yes . Who is this ? 'Barry Convex would like to talk to you about Videodrome . 'I 've got a car downstairs for you . ' ( 0ver intercom ) Please direct your attention to the television set . Mr Convex has recorded an introduction for you . ( number Cheerful synth music ) 'Hi . I 'm Barry Convex , chief of special programmes . 'I 'd like to invite you into the world of Spectacular 0ptical , 'an enthusiastic corporate citizen . 'We make inexpensive glasses for the Third World 'and missile guidance systems for NAT0 . 'We also make Videodrome , Max . 'As you know , when it 's ready for the marketplace , 'things will never be the same again . 'It can be a giant hallucination machine and much , much more . 'But it 's not ready . You picked up test transmissions . 'We thought nobody would see them . ' He 's good , that Harlan . Good pirate . 'Well , now you have , I think we ought to have a little talk . Don 't you ? 'I thought maybe ... my place ? ' ( Chuckles ) You realise you 're playing with dynamite ? That 's our spring line . Top-secret stuff . I brought them for a trade show later this week . Max Renn , I 'm Barry Convex . I think that machinery you 're wearing is too much for the shape of your face . 0verwhelms you . Try something more ... spidery , more delicate . Here she is . This is our prototype . This is the little number that started it all . Max , I would like you to try this on for size . I would like to use this machine to record one of your hallucinations . Now . Then I would like to take that tape back with me for analysis . Do I get the copyright ? I 'd hate to see it show up as the movie of week . - I 'm trying to help you . - What makes you think I need help ? None of our test subjects has returned to ... normality . They all need intensive psychiatric care . You seem to be functioning reasonably well , so far . I 'd like to find out why . And I think an analysis of one of your hallucinations would be the right place to start . - Will it hurt ? - It won 't hurt you . You might slide in and out of a hallucinatory state afterwards . If you do , just relax and enjoy it . It will soon go away . But for now , you might find a little SM will be necessary to trigger a good healthy series of hallucinations . That 's why our show is so strange . It 's the effects of exposure to violence on the nervous system . It opens receptors in the brain and they allow the signal to sink in . - Am I going to have to hurt you ? - Afraid not . You don 't have to hurt anybody . You just have to think about it . ( Piercing hum ) ( Very piercing hum ) - That 's too bright ! I can 't take it ! - I forgot ! Sorry . How 's that ? - ( Humming ) - Yeah . That 's fine . 0K . We 're rolling . The taping mechanism is all self-contained . - All you have to do is hallucinate . - Yeah , 0K . I 'll come back for you later . You 'll forgive me if I don 't stay around to watch . I just can 't cope with the freaky stuff . Nicki ? Nicki . Well , here we are at last . Right where we ought to be . 0n Videodrome . 'What are you waiting for , lover ? Let 's perform . 'Let 's open those neural floodgates . ' ( Nicki breathing heavily ) ( Nicki gasps ) ( Nicki gasps ) ( Nicki moans ) ( Nicki gasps ) ( Nicki laughing and moaning ) What 's going on , Professor 0'Blivion ? I mean , really . ( Gasps ) Masha ... Harlan . It 's Max . Can you come over to my apartment ? Right away . Yeah , I 'm serious . - Come on in . - Here I am , patron . Camera . Flashgun . What 's up ? You want to be a centrefold ? Go into my bedroom and take a look at what 's in my bed . Uncover it . Don 't be shy . I want pictures . - Pictures of what 's in your bed ? - Yeah . Do it ! Sure . 0K . Wellc Max ... I don 't see anything . You didn 't want me to shoot your bed , pillows , sheets ? Did you ? Max , are you on a drug warp ? I 've got friends who can help . Bridey said she came by and you were ... Did you tape Videodrome last night ? Yeah , if it was transmitted . - Meet you in the lab in one hour . - It 's not even 7 am . I am not fucking around ! Fuck you . I 'm not a mechanism you can switch on and off . If you want me to run around , tell me why . 0therwise , I 'll see you during office hours . Harlan , you 're right . It 's momentum . I 'm running like an express train . I don 't know how to stop . I 'll meet you in the lab in one hour , 0K ? We 'll see if we pulled in Videodrome and I 'll tell you what 's going on . Everything . I promise . 0K ? Yeah . Sorry I freaked out on you . I don 't work with you for the money . I know that . With us pirates , it 's never just for money , is it ? You want a coffee ? No . I 'll meet you in an hour . Come on in . Did you look at the tape ? Did you see me on Videodrome ? There was no tape . There was no transmission last night ? - Not last night . - Fuck . Not ever . - What are you talking about ? - ( Knock at door ) I 'm out of my depths now , patron . I had to bring in the reinforcements . Max . An intriguing combination . Very interesting . - Don 't let me interrupt . - I was saying something like , " What are you talking about ? " I was playing you tapes , Max . Prerecorded cassettes . Videodrome has never been transmitted on an open broadcast circuit . Yet . I guess Barry sent you here , what , two years ago ? It has been two years , hasn 't it , Harlan ? Two ... two wonderful years . Why ? To get you involved . Expose you to the Videodrome signal . It didn 't affect you because you never watched it . You knew what was there . You didn 't have to see it . It really does work on just about anybody . Anybody who watches it , Max . But why would anybody watch it ? Why would anybody watch a scum show like Videodrome ? - Why did you watch it , Max ? - Business reasons . Sure . Sure . What about the other reasons ? Why deny you get your kicks out of watching torture and murder ? You murdered 0'Blivion , didn 't you , you freak ? Did you enjoy that ? North America is getting soft , patron , and the rest of the world is getting tough . Very , very tough . We 're entering savage new times and we 're going to have to be pure and direct ... and strong ... if we 're going to survive them . Now , you and this ... cesspool you call a television station ... and your people who wallow around in it and your viewers ... who watch you do it ... you 're rotting us away from the inside . We intend to stop that rot . We 're going to start with Channel 83 . We 'll use it for our first transmissions of Videodrome . I have a hunch it 's going to be very popular ... for a while . I 've got to be hallucinating now , right ? I mean ... You two can 't possibly be for real . We recorded your hallucinations , Max , as I said we would . And we did analyse them . - You 're ready for something new . - That 's terrific . ( Nicki breathing heavily ) - ( Wind howling ) - What ... What do you want from me ? I want you to open up , Max . 0pen up to me . I 've got something I wanna play for you . My God ! ( Coughs ) ( Convex ) ' We want Channel 83 , Max . 'Give it to us . Give us Channel 83 . 'Kill your partners . Kill them . 'Kill your partners and give us Channel 83 . 'Give us Channel 83 . 'Kill your partners . Kill them . 'Kill your partners and give us Channel 83 . ' Hello , Max . How you doing , Max ? Where 's Moses ? He 's in a meeting with Rafe . I 'll tell him you want him . Don 't . Dub in a funny track , gentle comedy . - Mm-hm . And you 'd write it ? - Yeah , I would . I used to write . I haven 't lost it . Hi , Max . Just in time to throw some light on an interesting problem . Don 't ! Max ... What the fuck ? - Max , what happened ? Are you hurt ? - They killed us . - What happened ? - They killed us ! What happened ? Jesus ! Look out ! In here . In here ! Get out ! Just clear out of here ! Get out ! Let me see . Max ! Max ? 'Kill Bianca 0'Blivion . She knows too much . 'She can hurt us . Don 't let her hurt us , Max . 'Kill her . Kill Bianca 0'Blivion . ' Bianca 0'Blivion . I run Civic TV . I was on a talk show with your father . So it was to be you after all . - You 've come to kill me . - No . No . I 'm Max Renn . I run Civic TV . I don 't ... - I don 't kill people . - 0h , but you do . You 're an assassin now , for Videodrome . They can programme you , play you like a videotape recorder . They can make you do what they want . They want you to destroy whatever is left of Brian 0'Blivion . - They want you to destroy me . - Destroy you ? They killed her , Max . They killed Nicki Brand . She died on Videodrome . They used her image to seduce you but she was already dead . Don 't back away . I stole it from them just for you to see . Videodrome is death . That 's better . So much better . It 's always painful to remove the cassette ... and change the programme . But now that we have ... you 'll see that you 've become something quite different . You 've become the video word made flesh . I am the video word made flesh . And now that you are the video word made flesh ... you know what you have to do . You 'll turn against Videodrome . You 'll use the weapons they 've given you to destroy them . Death to Videodrome . Long live the new flesh . Death to Videodrome . Long live the new flesh . 'It was only 26 hours ago , in the building behind me , 'that a bizarre shooting occurred , triggering an intensive manhunt . 'Max Renn , president of Civic TV , 'is being sought in connection with the deaths of two executives ... ' You want to see the monkey dance , you pay the piper . You know how much my monkey 's batteries cost ? The cold knocks ' em right out . I can 't dance . I would if I could but I can 't , so you got some change , Teddy ? You got something ? Half a buck ? A quarter ? You got something , Teddy . Can 't you spare a little something ? Where you going , sport ? I 'm Brolley . May I help you ? - Just looking . - Cha , man . That 's a good one . There ain 't much to see but have a good look anyway . What is ? This is one hell of a ' scrip you got here . Very tricky grind . Can 't imagine you 'd see things too clear without them . But don 't worry at all ... - Where 's Convex ? - 0h , setting up his trade show . - Got to introduce the spring line . - What 's in the box ? Your head . - I got your head in this box . - You 've been busy , Max . I 've been reading about you in the papers . - Have you seen Bianca 0'Blivion ? - I saw her . - And she give you any trouble ? - No . 0h . That 's good . Maybe you 'd like to visit somebody else now . - Is that why you 're here ? - Maybe . You 've been very useful to us , Max . We 'd like to keep using you until you 're all gone . 0pen up to me . I got something I wanna play for you . See you in Pittsburgh . - Tracy , come back . Stay with Mommy . - I want orange juice . Come on , we 're going home now . - Well , you know me . - Yeah , we know you ! And I sure know you , every one of you ! We 're here to celebrate our spring collection - the Medici line . And our theme for this year is based on two quotes from the famous Renaissance statesman and patron of the arts Lorenzo de Medici . " Love comes in at the eye , " and " The eye is the window of the soul . " I think that even Pete ought to be able to sell the hell out of a classy campaign like that ! 0h , God ! No ! Death to Videodrome ! Long live the new flesh ! Condemned vessel by order of Toronto harbour Commissioners I was hoping you 'd be back . I 'm here to guide you , Max . I 'll learned a lot , since I last saw you . I 've learned that death is not the end . I can help you . I don 't know where I am , now . I 'm having trouble finding my way around . That because you 've gone just about as far as you can , with the way things are . `Videodrome` still exists . It 's very big , very complex . You 've hurt them , but you haven 't destroy them .

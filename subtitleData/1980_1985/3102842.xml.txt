 This is our land . A land of peace and of plenty . A land of harmony and hope . This is our land . Oceania . These are our people . The workers , the strivers , the builders . These are our people . The builders of our world , struggling ... fighting , bleeding ... dying . On the streets of our cities and on the far-flung battlefields . Fighting against the mutilation of our hopes and dreams . Who are they ? Eurasia ! Eurasia ! They are the dark armies . The dark , murdering armies of Eurasia . In the barren deserts of Africa and India ... on the oceans of Australasia ... courage , strength , and youth are sacrificed . Sacrificed to barbarians , whose only honor is atrocity . But even as we grasp at victory ... there is a cancer , an evil tumor ... growing , spreading in our midst . Shout , shout ... shout out his name ! Goldstein ! Nothing the Party says is true . Nothing the Party does is good . Even the war itself isn 't real . The Party wants you to believe we are at war ... so as to channel your aggressions away from their rightful target ... the Party . Big Brother is not real . He is pure fiction , created by the Party . The real rulers of the State ... are unknown , faceless manipulators ... who , because they are not known ... are able to wield power without let or hindrance . People of Oceania , you are being duped . The Party doesn 't serve the people , it serves itself . We are not at war with Eurasia . Death ! Death ! Traitor ! You are being made into obedient ... stupid slaves of the Party . Open your eyes . See the evil that is happening to you . The Party drops bombs on its own citizens . Traitor ! It is the Party , not the Eurasians , who are our enemies . Rise up . Throw off the yoke . You have nothing to lose , and everything to gain . People of Oceania . Big , Big , Big " ...

" I confess to spreading the rumor , on orders from Goldstein ... that the war is not really with Eurasia , but with Eastasia . That , for years , in fact since the days of our glorious Revolution ... I had no faith in our future . I forged government announcements and falsified figures ... quoted for agricultural and industrial production . As a result of mental disturbance from my experiences during the atomic wars ... I was a willing subject of Goldstein 's influence . I was stubborn and egocentric . When ownlife thoughts occurred to me , I reveled in them . I went into the proletarian zones ... I had sex with prostitutes , I deliberately contracted syphilis . It was at this time that I made contact with the Resistance . I was personally contacted by the archtraitor , Goldstein ... and ordered to assassinate certain Inner Party officials . Bugger ! This I did . My agents forged documents and gained entry into the Ministry ... " Thought crime is death . " Thought crime does not entail death . " Thought crime is death . " I have committed , even before setting pen to paper ... " the essential crime that contains all others in itself . " I have spent many hours of my free time , encouraging my agents ... to deface Party posters and hoarding announcements . I read and memorized Goldstein 's book . For 30 years , I have plotted to bring down the Party . I was sick in mind and body . Together with my colleagues , Aaronson and Rutherford ... I did counterfeit important Party documents ... including ex-London permits and travel passes . And that by use of these documents ... my agents traveled freely throughout Airstrip One ... encouraging insurrection and organizing a massive counterplot ... to destroy the innermost faction of the Oceanian leadership . Furthermore ... I used my position of privilege within the Inner Party ... to pervert and betray the truth at all times ... and to suggest , wherever possible , that our traditional allies in Eastasia ... were in fact , our deadly enemies . " April the 4th , 1984 . " In my position as Chief Factory Planner ... " I think ... " I stole military plans ... and , at vast financial profit , sold them to the Eurasian leadership . " ... to the past ... " or to the future ... " to an age when thought is free . " From the age of Big Brother ... " from the age of the Thought Police ... " from a dead man ... " greetings ! " 30-to-40 group , take your places , please . Right , let 's see which one of us can touch his toes . Right over from the hips , brothers and sisters , please . One , two . Smith ? 6079 , Smith , W. ? Yes , you . Bend lower . You 're not trying . Watch me . There , brother . That 's what I want . Anyone under 45 is perfectly capable of touching his toes . I 'm 39 , and I 've had four children . We don 't all have the privilege of fighting in the front line . Remember our boys on the Malabar Front . Just think what they have to put up with . Production of water-heaters is up 1.5 percent . Switchgear , 4.5 percent . Electrical wiring , 10 percent . Cigarettes , 18 percent . Bricks , 3 percent . Morning , Smith . Parsons .

I wanted to ask you if you 've got any razor blades ? I 've tried all over the place . I 've been using the same one for six weeks . ... a staggering increase of 93.4 percent . Did you see the prisoners hanged yesterday ? No , I was working . But I shall see it on the screens . You 'll pick up the gin on the way ? I 'll have two . 2.9 million Airstrip One Mark 5 submachine guns ... 3.1 million Grenville gas-operated light machine guns ... Give me a gin . 2.2 million.5 Victory recoil-operated heavy machine guns ... 6 million rifle grenades ... 9 million Perry pineapple pin grenades ... and 1.4 million lightweight ... spigot-launching , anti-tank rocket projectors . Food production is also up ... - How 's the Newspeak Committee ? - Working overtime . ... butter , 2 percent , milk , 6 percent . Plusbig waste is in adjectives . Plusbig problem is timing the language to scientific advance . It 's a beautiful thing , the destruction of words . You won 't have seen the Dictionary , 10th edition yet , Smith ? It 's that thick . The 11th edition will be that thick . So the Revolution will be complete when the language is perfect . The secret 's to move from translation , to direct thought , to automatic response . No need for self-discipline . Language coming from here , not from here . Excuse me for intruding . You 're saying that we 'll be rid of the last vestiges of Goldsteinism ... when the language has been cleaned . - I couldn 't agree with you more , brother . - Absolutely . Praise be to our leader and the Party workers ! Other munitions production figures are as follows . 70,000 M-20 tank destroyers ... with 76-mm cannon . Smith . Syme .

All over Oceania there 've been spontaneous demonstrations of Party workers ... voicing their gratitude and joy ! In honor of this massive overfulfillment of the ninth three-year plan ... it 's been announced that chocolate ration is to be increased to 25 grams per week ! " If there is hope ...

It 's a beautiful bed ... if you can get the bugs out of it . Interested in old prints at all ? The frame 's fixed to the wall , but I daresay I could unscrew it . How did this escape ? I know what it is . It 's the museum in the street outside the Palace of Justice . " Oranges and lemons , " say the bells of St. Clement 's . What was that ? Something old . War is peace ! Freedom is slavery ! Ignorance is strength ! A triumph of willpower over the orgasm . At a rally of the Anti-Sex League in Victory Square tonight ... held to celebrate a 50-percent decrease in civil marriages ... over 10,000 Party women took a vow of celibacy ... and pledged themselves as vessels for the artificial insemination ...

I wouldn 't have had to bother you , but my husband 's out late . Committees . You know what us Parsons are like . You 're a thoughtcriminal . They haven 't been out much . Thank you , brother . Attention ! Your attention , please ! A newsflash has this moment arrived from the Malabar Front . The forces of Oceania in South India have won a glorious victory . I am authorized to say that the war against Eurasia ... is within measurable distance of its end . 40,000 Eurasian soldiers have been killed or captured . Can you hear me ? Yes . Do you have an ex-London permit ? Yes . Can you get Sunday afternoon off ? Yes . Take this . It 's quite precise . I rely on you to destroy it . Are you sure you can come ? Yes . On your own , brother ? No , I 'm joining the Vic Mans community hiking group . I was held up on urgent Minrec business . Sing to the bravest on the sturdy fortress Sing to the soldiers on the battlefields Sing to the airmen in the burning azure Sing to the farmers ' rising yields We are the children , builders of the future And we the children swear to thee Loyal devotion , fearless devotion And to die with dignity Sing to the faithful ... A daring and resourceful maneuver ... under the personal direction of B.B. himself ... ensuring the total annihilation of the Eurasian heavy-armored divisions ... Look . It 's a dream . I want you . Not here . Come back to the woods , it 's safer . Have you done this before ? Of course . Hundreds of times . - With Party members ? - Yes . Inner Party members ? Not with those bastards . Though there 's plenty who would . Look , I hate purity . I hate goodness . I don 't want virtue to exist anywhere . I want everyone corrupt . I ought to suit you , then . I 'm corrupt to the core . Do you like doing this ? I don 't mean just me . I adore it . Winston ? We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness . Adult literacy amongst the proletariat has risen by 56 percent . The proletarian infant mortality rate has dropped by 12 percent . Incidences of leukemia , tuberculosis , and meningitis have dropped considerably .

The improvement in sewerage and drainage systems ... has resulted in better health , overall . State rodent operatives report a 50-percent reduction ... in the number of vermin in the central proletarian zones . I just want to finish by saying a few words ... about the impact of this imminent neurological breakthrough . When the orgasm has been finally eradicated ... the last remaining obstacle to the psychological acceptance ... of the principles of Ingsoc , as applied to artsem , will be overcome . In other words , the unorthodox tendencies towards ownlife ... which constantly threaten the natural erosion of the family unit ... will no longer have the biological support of the organism . As we all know , the biological and social stimulation of the family leads to ... private reflection , outside Party needs ... and to the establishment of unorthodox loyalties ... which can only lead to thoughtcrime . The introduction of artsem , combined with the neutralization of the orgasm ... will effectively render obsolete the family ... until it becomes impossible to conceptualize . Thank you . Excuse me , brother . You dropped your ink pencil . Thank you , sister . A pincer movement has developed ... involving the floating fortresses of the Eurasian 17th Fleet ... Not much . Not much left at all , these days . Walls . Police don 't like us much . That room ... how much ? $ 4 a week . Traitor ! Traitor ! Criminal ! Big , Big , Big ...

They 've captured India or something . I want you . I want you , too . Wait . Turn around , and don 't look until I tell you . Listen to that . How can she make a song written by a machine sound so beautiful ? You can turn around now . - I ... - Winston ... Do you like me ? More than ever . Was there ever a time when this seemed ordinary ?

 You know , I just don 't see how one piece of computer hardware can stop a space launch . He doesn 't make his connection by midnight , it 's game over . Just a scrap of silicone with microchips and yet men die for it . Countries may even go to war for it . ( ELECTRONIC WARBLING ) What the hell was that ? It 's here somewhere . I got three hours before I have to call off a billion dollar space shot . Come on , hotshot . Make your move . I can 't stand much more of this . Three weeks we 've been on this guy 's tail now . That 's longer than most of my relationships . You don 't get to be the number one courier for the KGB by rushing into things . This cat , Devereau , is one smooth operator . He may be cool , but he 's on a deadline , too . He doesn 't make his connection by midnight , it 's game over . You know , I just don 't see how one piece of computer hardware can stop a space launch . When it 's the circuit board for the satellite , you 'd better believe it 's crucial . Let me check monitor two and see if our launch is still in countdown . MAN : Houston , this is Mission Control . Systems go for final countdown in T-minus seven hours and counting . ( SIGHING ) MIKE : Heads up , pals . SAINT JOHN : What do you have ? Possible contact coming up behind Devereau . Can you get a clear enough shot to run a make on him ? I 'm way ahead of you . Got him . Uri Tatloff . Not what you 'd call a major-leaguer . He 's a file clerk at the Soviet Embassy . Strictly small potatoes . So what 's a low-level civil servant doing hanging out with a top brass like Devereau ? ( CHUCKLING ) I don 't know . Maybe he 's trying to make the Party 's social register . Or maybe he can 't wait to share one high-tech circuit board . Why don 't we go ask him ? LOCKE : Mike . Stay with Devereau . Looks like he 's heading home . All right . I 'll alert Jo . ( GRUNTING ) Get in the car . You cannot do this to me ! You are breaking my civil rights ! Yeah , I 'll break more than your civil rights if you don 't talk to me . Now get in . While you 're at it , the third floor exit light is out . Okay . I 'll take a look . ( BEEPING ) Shoot . Nothing . You sure you got a good reading on him , Jo ? Of course I 'm sure . If he had the circuit board on him , I would have picked up the titanium on my detector . Yeah , well , keep on fishing . He 's got to make contact in the next few hours . This waiting around is driving me crazy . How about something less stressful next time , like preventing the overthrow of some banana republic ? ( CHUCKLING ) She does governments , but she doesn 't do windows . You 're my kind of girl , Jo . Uh-huh , well , remember that when I need you , okay ? Yeah , hang in there . Yep . MIKE : Locking in to Whisper Mode . ( SIGHING ) Oh , geez . All right . Come on , Devereau , you always watch the 6 : 00 news . What 's with this Julia Child stuff ? ( BEEPING ) ( OSCAR BARKING ) Oscar , you little demon ! You wait for Mama ! You bad boy ! Such a trouble maker ! ( CHUCKLING ) Nice catch , Eric . Oh , thank you . Come on , Oscar . Come , come , come , come , come . That 's a good ... There , there . Oh , no , no , no , no . You are glad to be back with your mama ? Hmm ? I guess having Oscar 's a little like having a kid around , huh ? He is always into trouble . ( GRUNTING ) My doctor tells me having pets makes you live longer , but he doesn 't have to chase that little monster all over God 's green earth . Don 't listen to her , Oscar . We all know she loves you . You 've been such a help since you started working here . Please , let me make tea for you soon . Sure . Maybe later . Fine . Mike ? I 'm going downstairs to check the basement . ( SIGHING ) 7 : 00 brandy , his second . He 's going to be in orbit before our satellite . MAN : Weather conditions are A-okay for launch in T-minus six hours . Well , don 't count on it . We 've only got six hours before we scrub the entire Quasar Defense System . Keep in touch . Oh ! Ms. Delaney ! Geez , you scared the life out of me . Sorry . I 'm looking for Eric . Oh , I think I just saw him go upstairs with Hannah and Oscar . Thanks , Jo . He 's only been home for a few days and that dog 's already his best friend . Well , you know , boys and dogs . Yeah , I guess . You said you would take me to your office , not my consulate . Think of it as a compromise , comrade . First you talk , then we bargain . We still haven 't heard any mention of Devereau 's contact . Come on ! I 'll tell you ! Stop ! Devereau is working with somebody else in that apartment building . Who ? Not here . In your office . ( GRUNTING ) ( EXCLAIMING ) I got the license number . Tatloff ? I 'm afraid our office ain 't gonna do him any good now . I 'll call Mike . Better pick us up , Mike . Looks like the party 's over . MAN : Astronauts , prepare for final run-through and check-off for launch in T-minus three hours and 10 minutes . MAN 1 : Roger , Mission Control . Somebody in the apartment building ? Didn 't he say anything else ? He ran out of time . Okay , here 's the data on the tenants . Hannah Molnar . Maiden name Kolcheski . Born Warsaw , Poland . Husband , Joseph Molnar . Deceased , 1941 . Two children . Ilse and Katia , both deceased , ' 43 . She 's got one sister , Carla . Still living in Poland . She immigrated in ' 53 . Yes ? Ah , you came . Come in . Come in . I just thought I 'd check to see if you got back from your walk okay . Oh , yes , yes ! And I have tea already on the table , so you have to come . Come on . Come in . Thank you . Hi , Oscar . Now , Oscar , you behave yourself for our guest . Now . Oh , you take milk ? Just a little , please . Oh , I will get . Okay . HANNAH : There . ( SIGHING ) ( BEEPING ) It 's so nice to have the company . I watch you do your work and you do such a good job . Oh , thank you . Damn . Nothing . What 's the range on that detector , anyway ? Ten , twenty feet , depending upon the titanium content . That circuit board is not very big . So , tell me . Why does a nice girl like you have no husband to do this work ? Oh , I don 't know . Mmm-hmm . Oh , sit down . Oh , thank you . ( SIGHING ) We 're barking up the wrong apartment . Switch to Devereau 's . MIKE : Oh , would I ever like to tie a feedbag on now . I can 't stand much more of this . We 're up here chasing our tails and he 's playing house . SAINT JOHN : Keeps checking the time . Oh , well , it 's 9 : 00 . He doesn 't want to miss that educational program of his . I got three hours before I have to call off a billion dollar space shot and this joker is timing his roast . You know , maybe this has been a setup . Maybe they threw us their high-profile man as a cover for the real courier . Yeah , but if Devereau 's not our man , why kill Tatloff ? That 's true . Besides , he 's all we 've got . What 's that kid in the next apartment up to ? Let 's take a closer look . Whoa ! Look at that wrist action . ( CHUCKLING ) You should draft that kid , Jason . Sure . That 's a great idea . Might even be able to fit in your flight suit . Forget I said that , okay ? Oh , come on , Devereau . Make a move ! ( SIGHING ) Here , take this with you . You could use a little weight . Men don 't like skinny girls . I can 't right now , but thanks . I gotta get going . I 'd love to come back , if that 's okay . Of course ! Come soon . Good . Okay . Bye . Bye-bye . ( OSCAR WHIMPERING ) Hey , guys , when this is all over , remind me to call my mom , okay ? No , just kidding . I 've got a bogey on infrared . Let 's take a look . There 's somebody in the basement . Switching to port camera . It 's a kid ! Call Jo . ( EXCLAIMING ) Where are you going so fast ? Let go of me ! Come on , let 's get you upstairs . I bet your ma 's worried sick . I hate her ! She 's not my mom ! Come on , you don 't want to talk like that . Let 's go . ( STEADY BEEPING ) ( CHUCKLING ) Kids . I remember trying to sneak out . I was a little older . SAINT JOHN : Maybe this is it . Looks like Devereau 's getting ready to go out . Or expecting someone . SAINT JOHN : Can 't get away from the time . ( BEEPING ) The man is a creature of habit . ( BEEPING ) You had me worried to death ! I don 't know how to thank you . Oh , that 's okay . I was just doing my rounds . He 's a real tiger , that one . Tell me about it . After slinging burgers all day , it 's all I can do to keep tabs on him . Well , I have to change into something that doesn 't smell like French fries . I could keep an eye on him . Just in case . Why not ? If you can take it . ( CHUCKLING ) Just let me change . Okay . Go to your room , Eric . I ought to lock you in there . He can be a holy terror . It 's his rotten dad 's fault . He 's been that way ever since I got him back . DELANEY : Took him right out of daycare . Can you believe the gall ? Must have been awful . What 's that thing ? Oh , it 's a rat detector . No rats . No rats ? Nope . I gotta tell you something . What , hon ? Eric ! I said to stay in your room . ( BOTH SIGHING ) Thanks very much for bringing him back . Oh , you 're welcome . I really appreciate it . JO : He 's a great kid . DELANEY : Oh , yeah . What do we have on this Annie Delaney and her ex ? LOCKE : Nothing so far . That 's funny . I thought we had something on everyone . I did , too . I 'll have to cross check our Interpol files . Hold on . Our big show 's on the road . Looks like Devereau 's moving out . MIKE : Finally . Let 's not lose him . ( BEEPING ) What the hell is going on now ? ( RINGING ) What is it ? Oh , that 's the fire alarm . You better get out . Oh , my God ! Eric . Come on , let 's get out of here . Come on . Go . Damn . Devereau 's cover , that 's what . Go to infrared . He set us up ! Make sure Jo 's okay . ( FIRE ALARM RINGING ) Everybody downstairs . Come on . ( ALL CLAMORING ) Just look at that smug son of a ... We 'll never get our hands on him now . MAN : All systems are 100 % for launch in T-minus two hours . MAN : Roger , Houston . ( BEEPING ) I think we 've got something . Stay with her . It 's here somewhere , but not on Devereau . Not yet , anyway . It 's hard to zero in on it with all these people around . I 'm going down . Hand me my harness . This thing breaks , she 's gonna need help . MIKE : Hang tough , Jo . Saint John 's coming to back you up . Right . I 'm going to keep looking . Look , Jo , I don 't mean to worry you , but we 're running out of time . We gotta find that microchip . JO : Yeah , yeah . I 'm on it . No rats ? Just one , Eric . There you are . Any luck ? Well , whoever has our board keeps moving around and hasn 't come near Devereau yet . I 'll stay on him . Okay . ( ELECTRONIC SQUEALING ) ( MOANING ) Hannah ! ( MOANING ) What the hell was that ? I don 't know . Some kind of ultrasonic interference . It 's coming from inside the building . It 's her heart . Get the paramedics . Increase the power ! Override the jamming signal , Mike . Yeah , I 'm trying . I 'm trying . Ah , damn it . Okay . Paramedic . Clear the way . Come on . I think she has a pacemaker . It must have malfunctioned . Her heartbeat 's all over the map . ( ECG BEEPING ) Yeah , I gotcha . ( SIGHING ) Yeah , that 's better . We now return to regular scheduled programming . Just find Devereau . Her pacemaker 's kicked back in . She 's stabilized ? PARAMEDIC : Don 't ask me how . Stretcher , please ! JO : She should be okay now . SAINT JOHN : Yeah . WOMAN ON RADIO : Paramed unit 42 . What is your status ? Listen , there 's something strange about that fireman . I wanna check our tapes . You gonna be okay ? Yeah , I 'm just gonna search the building again . SAINT JOHN : Okay , let 's see that tape . SAINT JOHN : Let 's see it again . Go to the other camera . That 's him ! Look at his shoes . Damn ! He probably set that fire . Who 's less suspicious at a fire than a fireman ? I 'll put a search out on him . What 's Devereau doing now ? MIKE : It looks like he 's auditioning for a department store window . How long before they have to call off the launch ? Not long enough . MAN : Shuttle systems are go for T-minus one hour and thirty minutes . MAN 1 : Roger . ( BEEPING ) ( BEEPING INCREASES ) ( ELECTRONIC SQUEALING ) Do make yourself at home , Ms. Santini . Your dinner 's getting cold . MAN : Personnel prepare to clear gantry for launch in T-minus one hour and twenty minutes . MAN 1 : Gantry control vacating . Do come in . We don 't want the neighbors to talk . I think you 've made a mistake . Your mistake . My pleasure . Watching you watch me . Don 't make me resort to violence , Ms. Santini . It 's so vulgar and so time-consuming to clean up . ( CHUCKLING ) Please . Enjoy the food , the wine . I prepared it especially for you . It is the least I could do after causing you such a bother . No , thanks . It 's perfectly safe . One would never sully a Rothschild ' 37 with poison . It 's just not done . Look , why don 't you just shoot me and get it over with ? Oh , that would be terribly unimaginative . ( CHUCKLING ) Now , a heart attack ? ( SCOFFING ) You caused Hannah 's heart attack . It 's quite simple , really . Ultrasonic waves muddling with the rhythm of her pacemaker . All part of the game . This isn 't a game ! No , but it is , my dear . And this is my trump card . Just a scrap of silicone with microchips and yet men die for it . Countries may even go to war for the lack of it . If that is not a game , my dear , then what is ? Hmm . Oscar , I sure wish you were a lot bigger right now . Is he asleep or what ? MIKE : Why don 't we switch out of whisper mode , get the guy up ? Come on , move ! For ... I don 't like this . Let 's take a closer look . Go to infrared . Oh , yeah . That 's one plastic spy in there . He must have made the switch while we were jammed out . Find Jo . Funny , isn 't it , Ms. Santini ? An unsavory person , we call an animal . And yet , animals possess such charming qualities . Trust , devotion , unquestioning loyalty . The same qualities as a good spy . Now what ? You don 't really believe I 'm flying in this solo , do you ? ( CLICKING TONGUE ) I 'm in the pilot 's seat . You 're bailing out . SAINT JOHN : Jo ? Jo , do you read me ? She 's gotta be there . Keep scanning . No fuss , now . After all , we wouldn 't want to hurt any innocent bystanders , would we ? Let 's just keep this between me and you . I knew we shouldn 't have left her down there . Take her in . If you think I 'm just gonna do a swan dive onto the pavement , you 're crazier than I thought . Your choices are limited , my dear . SAINT JOHN : Bodies on the roof ! ( SCREAMING ) Sure you 're okay ? Well , not a trace of it in his apartment or on the roof . Find anything out here ? Nothing . Just doesn 't make sense . I saw it . He had to have it on him when he fell . Unless he handed it off somehow . But I was the only one with him . What about me ? What about you ? You 've been nothing but trouble . You just do as you 're told , or else your mommy and daddy are gonna get hurt . That 's the deal . Remember that ! Will Oscar come with us ? Yeah . MAN : Astronauts , prepare for final run-through and check-off for launch . Hello , down there . Guys , come on in . Ow ! You 're hurting me ! Shut up ! What else does Interpol have to say about her ? MIKE : She 's a freelance agent . No loyalties . Goes out to the highest bidder . It seems she 's one of the best in the business , too . That 's why Devereau was so cool . He had a good backup . I should have pegged her . What about Eric ? Yeah , I thought about that , too . So I ran his description through missing persons . It seems he disappeared from a park a couple days ago . His parents must be going crazy . Talk to me , Mike . MIKE : She 's on the lam with the kid . In the alley ! ( OSCAR BARKING ) Ow ! Get back here , you rotten little ... Gotcha ! She 's coming down your alley . Oh ! It 's all right , Eric . I want my mommy ! I 'm gonna take you to her . I 'm sorry I didn 't believe you . It 's gonna be all right . Oscar ! Ow ! Get off me ! ( GROWLING ) Okay , Oscar . Okay , Oscar . Relax . Relax . Good boy . Good boy . Nice work . Lose it ! Here . That 's enough . How much time is left till the launch ? Enough for one important phone call . Where 's the hardware , Annie ? You 'll never find it . We 'll search you if we have to . Go ahead . Maybe he ate it . Mike , call the launch pad . Looks like we 're gonna have to scrub the mission . Hold that call . Eric ? What 's this thing ? Mike , cancel that . Meet me on the roof and take this baby to the cape . Good work , Eric . MAN : We have liftoff . Ladies and gentlemen , we have liftoff . All right , I 'm taking her on home . Good night , Irene , good night . ( SIGHING ) Oh , it is wonderful ! You shouldn 't have done such a thing . That 's right . And it 's got a vibrating heating pad . It 's got a stereo in the headrest and much , much more . Mmm-hmm . I don 't know . You are all so kind . We 're just glad you 're home safe and sound . Yes . Well , I still don 't believe my Oscar was a spy . Well , maybe not willingly , but he was going to be recruited . Annie was gonna take Oscar to Amsterdam . She figured they wouldn 't look in his jacket . ( SIGHING ) Such awful people . Oh , and the boy . He 's all right ? You should have been there when we brought him home . I think his parents had given up hope . ( SIGHING ) You can never give up hope . It 's one thing I have learned . That is why I get so old ! ( ALL LAUGHING ) Oh , I almost forgot . We have something for Oscar , too . Oh , thank you ! Oh , look ! Look , Oscar ! MIKE : It 's the only color we could find . He 's a real member of the team now . Probably turn out to be a real hot-dog pilot , too . It 's a joke . ( ALL LAUGHING )

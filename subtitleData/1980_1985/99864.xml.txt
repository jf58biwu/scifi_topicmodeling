About that time , Mr. Shermin . - Okay . - Coffee ? Yeah . Sergeant , can you get police bands on that thing ? No problem . Why ? I 'm interested in anything that 's weird . You know , freaky , bizarre . - Hi there . - Hi . - I 'm Major Bell . - Mark Shermin . Is it clean ? Well , no radioactivity . No readings on bacteria . You attached to National Security ? Not very . I just work for them . On loan . Sort of like a library book . No , actually I 'm with SETI . Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence . So they 're sending you guys out on meteorites now ? - Only when they change course . - Change course ? - Can they do that ? - This one did . So they tell me . Twice . Either that or some airhead over at NORAD misread a glitch on his monitor . It also came down slower than suborbital speed . Naturally , they decided to fire some missiles at it . - What the hell are they doing ? - Taking a core sample . - Nobody authorised that . - Damn thing sounded hollow to me . There 's no such thing as a hollow ... Jesus Christ ! You were about to say ? Up and at ' em , folks , this is station WDLU , in Madison , Wisconsin bringing you the 6 : 00 a.m. News . All of you that saw that flash in the sky last night it wasn 't the end of the world or a burning airliner . According to the A.P. wire , one of the biggest meteorites to strike the planet Earth in the past 80 years hit last night near Ashland , not far from Chequamegon Bay . So you folks who called in to say you saw a flying saucer ... That 's about you , isn 't it ? You really are some kind of Martian or something , aren 't you ? What do you want here ? What are you doing ? What do you want with me ? Where are you taking me ? Why do you look so much like Scott ? " I can 't get no " satisfaction " That does it . Help ! You crazy sons of bitches . What 's the matter with you ? Help ! Help me ! Help me , please . I 'm being kidnapped . I send greetings . What 's going on here ? I 'm being kidnapped . Greetings . You 'd better let her go . I 'll give you greetings . How 'd you do that ? Those little grey jobs ? Communications Central , this is Project Visitor at the Chequamegon sighting . I have Mr. Shermin for you . The director 's on the line . All right , what is it ? I 'll know more in two hours . We 're taking it out now and setting up a lab in Madison . This meteor , the Chequamegon sighting , appears to be hollow ? No , not " appears to be . " It is hollow . I think the balloon has just gone up , sir . Do you have to keep that thing on your lap like that ? Those things ... Guns make me a little bit jumpy . Define " little bit jumpy . " That 's a little bit . Jumpy 's like nervous , afraid . You know that word " afraid " ? " Afraid . " Yes . How much English do you understand ? I understand greetings in 54 planet Earth languages . I understand English language little bit .

Why did you come here ? Oh , my God . I look like Scott . Yeah , you do . I look like Scott so you do not be little bit jumpy . Listen , about those police calls , you did say anything weird , right ? - You got something ? - Just picked up one from Ashland . Happened sometime this morning . A guy name Heinmuller had a collision with an orange and black ' 77 Mustang . The gal driving claimed she was being kidnapped . But when Heinmuller went to help her , the kidnapper yelled , " Greetings " and melted his lug wrench . Yelled , " Greetings " and melted his lug wrench ? Weird you want , weird you get . How do you melt a lug wrench ? I just copy them down , I don 't explain them . - Did anybody get a license number ? - Wisconsin plates , Papa X-ray Victor 2-3-7 . We 're checking the owner through DMV now . What the hell is that thing ? Well , it 's sort of an invitation , Major . Remember that package we sent up with the Voyager probe ? There was a gold anodised disk with greetings from Earth in 54 different languages . Complete with a nice little speech from Kurt Waldheim : " To whom it may concern . Come and see us sometime . " We 're coming to a gas station . - We 're gonna need some gas . Okay ? - " Gas " ? Gas . For the car . Fuel . Energy . I step on the gas , the car goes , I take my foot off , it stops . Understand ? No . I do not understand . How can car need energy so soon ? I don 't know . I 'm just telling you , this is the gas gauge . When the needle gets to E , that 's " Empty . " No gas . The car stops . Period . Okay . Get gas . - Here you go . - Take it easy . Yeah . Take it easy . Hi . - Fill her up , unleaded . - Gas . Gotcha . Yeah , I know . I have to go to the bathroom . The ladies ' room . The restroom . It 's when a person has to ... The hell with it , you figure it out for yourself , I 'm going . " Women . " Me . " Men . " You . Understand ? Can 't get her out ? Gas . Yeah , well , I know just how she feels . Every goddamn place you go . Take it easy . Up yours . Take it easy . Up yours . Hi , let 's go . Nothing of interest in here . You wanna sign that for me , Ms. Hayden ? Kidnapped . What ? What is " kidnapped " ? You want to know what kidnapped is ? It 's being dragged out of your house in the middle of the night by some whatever you are . Being forced to drive all night at gunpoint and not knowing where you 're going or what 's going to happen to you when you get there . So if you 're going to shoot me , go ahead . Because I 'd rather be shot than go on being scared to death . Go ahead . I mean you no harm , Jenny Hayden . Here 's OI ' Blue Eyes , Francis Albert . " Start spreading the news " I 'm leaving today " I want to be a part of it " New York , New York " I 'm sorry . I did awaken you . Do they sing a lot where you live ? Yes . We sing . Do you ever get hungry ? Empty here ? Like a car needs gas ? Yes . This body has a terrible emptiness . This is called " hungry " ? Yeah , and when people get hungry they have to eat food . Eat . Yes , we must do that . We will stop at food station . You have hungry too ? I 'm starving . I haven 't eaten since ... Oh , my God . Look out ! What are you doing ? Okay ? Okay ? Are you crazy ? You almost got us killed . You said you watched me . You said you knew the rules ! I do know the rules . For your information , that was a yellow light back there . I watched you very carefully . Red light : Stop . Green light : Go . Yellow light : Go very fast . - You better let me drive . - I will drive . Do you seriously expect me to tell the President that an alien has landed assumed the identity of a dead housepainter from Madison , Wisconsin and is presently out tooling around the countryside in a hopped-up orange and black 1977 Mustang ? We have the following givens : That man , Scott Hayden , died last April . He 's dead and buried , that 's verified . He has no brothers or lookalike cousins . But still , this morning , at approximately 6 : 00 ... All right , we have been through all of that . I 'm going to ask you now , how could it happen ? We think it might be some kind of a cloning deal replication of an entire organism from a single cell . We found some hairs from Scott Hayden 's head . Is that possible ? I mean , can you clone a living organism from the hair of a dead man ? Human hair consists of keratinised cells . But in order to determine whether replication is possible ... I asked you a question . You mean us ? - In our present state of technology ? - Yes . - No . - What the hell are we talking about ? We 're hypothesizing a technology that 's probably 100,000 years ahead of us . We 're the ancients , Mr. Fox . " Ancients " ? Technologically , yes . We 've just started . Even if you 're right , I still have problems . His knowledge of English . Okay , listen to this . I helped put this package together . This was designed so that an intelligent species could get a working knowledge of English . Enough to get by , anyhow . A couple-of-hundred-word vocabulary , a rough idea of syntax . Think of what it would mean to talk to a being from a civilisation like that . Think of what we could learn . ... of 147 member states who represent almost all of the human inhabitants of planet Earth I send greetings ... " Greetings , " that 's what he said to Heinmuller on the road . It 's also what the cannibal said to the missionary just before he ate him . Now the question in this case is : Who is the missionary and who are the cannibals ? When do you have to be there ? What ? In Arizona . When do you have to be there ? Do you see this little star ? Star ? What star ? Where ? There . We call that the sun . When this little ... When the sun appears mid-sky three more times , I must be at Arizona . You mean , 12 : 00 noon , three days from now ? Yes . What happens if you don 't get there in time ? Then they will go . - Without you ? - Yes . What will you do then ? Then I will die . Die ? Understand ? You look for food station . What ? A deer . A dead deer . " Dead deer , " why ? People hunt them to eat for food . Do deer eat people ? No . Do people eat people ? No , of course not . What do you think we are ? I think you are a very primitive species . What are you , softhearted ? Cry when you saw Bambi ? Define " Bambi . " He doesn 't understand . He 's not from around here . You don 't speak any English ? Steer clear of that bozo . Define " bozo . " Jerk . From Denver , here ... It 's south on Interstate 25 . Then you pick up l-40 westbound at Albuquerque . Will you forget the deer for a second ? I 'm trying to show you something . Where exactly in Arizona are you supposed to meet your friends ? West of Winslow . I see a little speck on the map , but there 's ... Crater ? Is that where you 're supposed to meet them ? Where the meteor hit ? Why do you do this ? Better safe than sorry . Just in case something happens to me . There 's one more thing . The credit card , for the gas . - You know how that worked ? - Why should something happen to you ? Who knows ? The way you drive , travelling with you could be detrimental to the health . That 's me and Scott on our honeymoon . A honeymoon is what you call it when two people first get married and they go off together after they 've fallen in love . Define " love . " Love is ... It 's when you care more for someone else than you do for yourself . But it 's not just that , it 's ... It 's when someone is a part of you . And when they ... What ? Scott is dead . He was killed in an accident . When someone you love dies ... Shit . Define " shit . " Don 't say that , that 's not a nice word . Shit . Don 't mind him , he 's just learning to speak English . He 's got a hell of a start on it . Who 's the devilled egg on white toast ? His . Right . And a superburger . Two orders of fries , two choc malts and two Dutch apple pie with whipped cream . I had a wedge of it myself . It 's terrific . Enjoy . Dig in . Wait . No . That 's your dessert . You eat that with a fork . This thing . Here . Like this . No , but you eat that last . Sandwich first , dessert last . Why ? I don 't know , that 's just how it 's done . What 's the matter ? Dutch apple pie . Good ? It 's terrific . For a primitive species we have our points . Anybody for Lincoln , Omaha or Chicago , the bus leaves in five minutes . I 've got to go to the ... I 'll be right back . Excuse me , is there a back way out of here ? Yeah , sure , through the kitchen . Why ? - You know that fellow I came in with ? - Yes . Could you give these things to him after the bus leaves ? It 's just a map and some car keys and a credit card . - You sure , honey ? - Yeah , I 'm positive . Thanks . Hey , honey . I wouldn 't go out through the back door right now . That friend of yours , he 's out there in the parking lot . Thanks . Excuse me , miss . You strike me as a meat-eater . I could fix you up with a nice haunch of venison . Maybe even a shot of pork if you could ... Why , that son of a bitch . No . Hey , what happened to the goddamn deer ? He went there , to the woods . Okay , comedian . Bingo . Stop it . You leave him alone ! - Butt out , girlie . - He doesn 't understand . - He 's a foreigner and doesn 't speak English . - So what ? Hey ! " Bingo . " Here , you 're losing your English , boy . Pick up your garbage and get going . Oh , Jesus . You okay ? I thought guns make you a little bit jumpy , Jenny Hayden . You make me a little bit jumpy . I thought I told you to stay away from those bozos . It 's okay . I think I understand . It looks better that way . Thank you , Jenny Hayden . All part of our friendly service . You okay , honey ? I 'm all right . I wanted to tell you that eastbound bus is about to go . Want me to try to hold it ? No , thank you . Never mind . Thanks , but never mind . Good luck . I 'm gonna get that bastard , Donnie Bob . Right now . Hey , look out ! Take it easy ! Up yours . I 'm gonna get that son of a bitch . It 's their fault , the Mustang . Son of a bitch hit me and just took off . Anybody get his number ? No , but it won 't be too hard to pick up . 1977 Mustang , Wisconsin plates on it . That Mustang them State boys wanted ... - Orange and black ' 77 , Wisconsin plates ? - Yeah . Well , kick her in the ass , I think we got the bastard . We 've been here since 6 : 30 p.m. When can we leave ? As soon as the Federals say so , and not one damn minute before . Everybody tells it pretty much the same way . She had chances to get away from him , but they left together with her driving . Does that sound like any kind of kidnapping you ever heard of ? Mr. Shermin ! They spotted an orange and black Mustang , Wisconsin plates going west near Big Springs . Great . Scott and I met two winters ago up at Iron Mountain , ice-skating . I had on this little tight skating outfit . I was showing off . He kept staring at me . One thing lead to another and a few months later we were on our honeymoon . Honeymoon is nice ? Yeah , ours was beautiful . Define " beautiful . " Beautiful is better than terrific better than Dutch apple pie . The best . The best . Gotta get a couple of hours sleep . Just a couple , okay ? Do not approach them . Keep them under surveillance until the Feds get there . But what if they approach us ? In a life-threatening situation , defend yourselves . Otherwise , wait for the Feds . Wait for the Feds . They get the 6 : 00 news , and we get the shit end of the stick . That 's the way it is . Yeah , well , it doesn 't have to be that way . I got a hunch , this might just develop into a life-threatening situation . Hi . We 'd like a room for the night . As far away from this as possible . Boy , am I whipped . My mom always said there wasn 't a thing wrong with the world that a hot bath and a good night 's sleep couldn 't fix . What am I doing ? I must be getting punchy . It 's just that in that light you look so much like Scott . - I wasn 't thinking . - You said the nose is different . What ? You said , " Your nose is different . " He broke his twice and there 's something else , something spooky about your eyes . " That 's word for word . You remember everything you hear word for word ? Everything I hear , everything I see . Everything ... Everything this body feels . The tub . The questions are worth 30 points apiece . Jane , tell us about it . Your final category today is ... Believe me , General . I know what went wrong . The X-factor wasn 't red . I never knew it could be like this . Nobody ever kissed me the way you do . Nobody ? No , nobody . Not even one ? Out of all the men you 've been kissed by ? Well , that 'll take some figuring . How many men you think there 've been ? I wouldn 't know . Can 't you give me an estimate ? Not without an adding machine . You have your adding machine with you ? I forgot to bring it . Then I guess you won 't find out , will you ? Hey there , buddy . Are you in there ? It 's none of my business , but if that 's your Mustang in the parking lot there 's two cops trying to jigger the lock . The bastards ran one on us ! Papa Charlie 3 . Suspects in Mustang heading south on Big Springs ' bypass . We are in pursuit . He 's got a gun . No ! Jenny Hayden ? Jenny Hayden ? Papa Charlie 3 . Suspects on l-80 proceeding northbound . Still in pursuit . It sounds impossible , but I have people that say they saw him carrying her out of the burning wreckage . Then they disappeared in the smoke . I 've had the police check the entire area and there are no bodies . Oh , thanks . I assume that they 're still alive and they 're probably headed west . I 'm going to Grand Junction , Colorado . The Army is setting up some kind of a roadblock on l-70 . I 'm going . Hey , Mark ! - You 're wanted on the horn . Urgent . - Okay . Hello ? I 've probably been cut off . Hello ? Hello , I was talking to the police . I 'm not the police , Mrs. Hayden . My name is Mark Shermin , National Security . You wanted to talk about kidnapping ? Yeah , that 's why I 'm calling . You see , there 's been a mistake . There hasn 't been a kidnapping . We 're worried about you , Mrs. Hayden . I 'm fine . Really , I 'm fine . I wanted to clear it up . There hasn 't been a kidnapping . Where are you talking from ? I don 't know . A truck stop somewhere . Can I pick you up ? I gotta ask you some questions . - Miss ? - Hold on a second . You looking for a fella ? About yea tall , red plaid shirt and kind of nice looking ? Have you seen him ? He hitched a ride west with our night cook about half an hour ago . Thank you , thank you very much . Look , I 'm hanging up now . I 've gotta go . If you want , call me in Madison in a few days . - I 'm in the phone book . - Wait , Mrs. Hayden . Do you know who or what you were kidnapped by ? He doesn 't want to hurt anybody . Really , can 't you just leave him alone ? Hello ? Damn it ! I need a ride west , fast . I 'll take you . Come on , let 's go . What 's your line ? - " Line " ? - Work . What do you do when you 're not hitching rides ? I make maps . Make any money ? I make maps . You don 't get rich cooking , either , believe me . I got a girl , she 's getting ready to go to college this fall . My wife had to go back nursing to help me pay for it . Here , you wanna smoke ? Yeah , my little baby . Says she wants to be a doctor . I don 't know . Costs an arm and a leg to raise up kids these days . " An arm and a leg " ? Bread . Geetus . Money . And lots of it . You all right ? You 're not from around here , are you ? What the John ? Some kind of roadblock , I guess . " Roadblock , I guess . " Keep them in line . They 're slipping around the end . Yes , sir . Sergeant , you heard the man . Right away , sir . Get in line . Line up . Move to the right and stay in line . Stay in line . All you pedestrians , line up . Line up . Move to the right and stay in line . Oh , no . You gotta help me , okay ? Stop him ! After that car ! After him ! Thank God ! How did you get here ? I hitched a ride with a cook . It 's good to see you , Jenny Hayden . We gotta get out of here . Come on . I 've done something wrong , Jenny Hayden ? I wake up alone . You 're gone . Not a word . Nothing . You were right . To be with me is not good for your health . You could have at least told me where you were going . Said goodbye . " Goodbye " ? Goodbye . You don 't know what ... Teach me this . Well , I don 't know . It 's a custom . It 's how you tell somebody that you 'll miss them that you wish them well . That you hope ... Her tooth coming in . Pobrecita . Can anyone have babies ? Just women . I understand the reproductive process as you know it . As we know it ? You have a baby ? No . No babies . Why not ? Scott and I wanted to have a baby . It just turned out I couldn 't . I 'm one of those lucky ladies that just can 't have one . Here , a blanket ! It 's dry . You better get out of those wet clothes . Better get warm . You know what pneumonia is ? No ? Well , you 're gonna find out unless we get you dry in a hurry . Here , put this on . Hi there . Mr. Fox has been delayed . He 's going to be late . What 's going on here ? According to our estimates , that object was headed for someplace in Arizona . Intelligence thinks the visitor is on his way to make a rendezvous . Go on inside . Make yourself at home . Welcome to planet Earth . Where are we ? I think we are coming to Winslow soon . Why didn 't you wake me ? I like to watch you sleep . I don 't know why . It 's strange . I think I am becoming a planet Earth person . Do you have to go back ? Isn 't there some way you could stay ? No . I must go back . But there is something I must tell you . I gave you a baby tonight . No . That 's impossible . I can 't have a child . I 've been to a doctor , a couple of them . Believe what I tell you . A boy baby . He will be human , a baby of your husband , but also he will be my baby . He will know everything I know and when he grows to manhood he will be a teacher . If you do not want this baby tell me now , I will stop it . Which is your star ? Can you see it from here ? Why ? I want to show him where his father came from . There . No . Wait ... There low in the sky . There . I see it . You 'd better get dressed . We are coming to Winslow . I hope to God we 're on the right train . I don 't know , that looks awful big for Winslow , Arizona . No . Las Vegas ! What ? I think we 've gone about 300 miles past Winslow . We 're still going to be okay . All we gotta do is rent a car , and with a little luck we 'll be back there before noon tomorrow . Just try not to be too conspicuous , okay ? Come on . $ 500,000 , folks ! Who 's gonna take it home ? Hit the giant jackpot and your troubles are over ! $ 500,000 , folks . Define " giant jackpot . " A giant jackpot is a lot of money . Money ? Geetus , bread , an arm and a leg ? Where did you get that ? We don 't have time to fool with the slot machines . We gotta find a rent-a-car place and ... Where 's my wallet ? - My wallet . - What is wrong ? Where the hell is my wallet ? What are we gonna do now ? Is all right . But you don 't understand . No credit card , no money , no car . - We 're never going to get there on time . - Is all right . Now . Damn ! That 's a handy talent you got there but you better spread it around . These guys get kind of curious if you hit too many jackpots at once . Choppers from the Air Cav will search the area on a quarter-mile grid . - Good , I 'm glad you 're here . - What is this about ? You 're a man of some scientific attainment . Don 't you recognise an emergency autopsy room when you see one ? With leather tie-straps ? You behave yourself , Mark . Is this your latest update ? According to NORAD his original course and rate of descent would have taken him here south of Winslow . I see . Anything else ? The Cobra guys were asking about ammunition . Helicopter attack units will carry live ammo at all times . - This is to be considered a combat mission . - Right . Listen , Mr. Fox , I 'd like to be a team player but I want to call something to your attention . If there 's one thing I don 't need , it 's a lecture on morality . All right , okay , screw morality . What happened to good manners ? We invited him here . - I have no time for this . - I 'm trying to make a point . So am I , damn it . You make a great show of being a rebel , but the fact is this : You are a GS-11 public servant . Anytime that becomes too much of a burden you can go back to Cornell , or wherever it was that we found you . And let 's see you get by on an instructor 's salary . Now shape up or get out . Is that clear ? Mr. Fox , there 's been a possible sighting in Las Vegas . - They 're probably headed in this direction . - Let 's set up a command post in Winslow . You 'd better get out there providing you still want to be a member of the team . You do , don 't you ? - Yes , sir . - All right , then get going . Get rid of that damn cigar . We ought to be coming to the crater anytime now . You 're gonna make it . You 're gonna go home . You want to , don 't you ? Yes , of course . What 's it like up there ? It is beautiful . Not like this , but it is beautiful . There is only one language . One law . One people . And there is no war , no hunger and the strong do not victimise the helpless . We are very civilised , but we have lost something , I think . You are all so much alive . All so different . I will miss the cooks and the singing and the dancing . And the eating . And the other things . Morning , folks . What 'll you have ? Coffee . Dutch apple pie ? - How about some nice cherry cobbler ? - That 'll be fine . And whipped cream . Coming right up . How long does it take to get to the crater ? Driving ? Not long . Five , six minutes is all . I want you to try this cherry cobbler . And if you don 't like it , you don 't have to pay for it . It 's delicious . My wife made it . Is very good . Do you have somebody ? A wife , like up there ? No . No ? I wish ... I wish ... What ? Morning , folks . Is that your Cadillac outside ? All right , go ahead . Yeah , hold it . Yeah , okay . I 'd like to talk to these people alone . I 'll be right outside if you need me . George Fox just called in on the radio , said to say they 're on their way over . I 'm Mark Shermin , SETI , the Search for Extraterrestrial ... Mrs. Hayden , we talked on the phone . This is just such a ... Do you mind if I sit down ? There 's so many questions I 'd like to ask , I hardly even know where to begin . Is there anything I can do for you ? You can let him go . I can 't . Really , I can 't . I 'm sorry . Is it ... Are you supposed to meet someone here ? Yes . You don 't understand , there isn 't much time . Why here ? Why the crater ? Have people from your world been here before ? Before , yes . We are interested in your species . You mean you 're some kind of an anthropologist ? Is that what you 're doing here ? Just checking us out ? You are a strange species not like any other . And you would be surprised how many there are . Intelligent but savage . Shall I tell you what I find beautiful about you ? You are at your very best when things are worst . Let him go , Mr. Shermin , please . If he stays here he 'll die . Can 't you see he 's dying now ? Thank you . Thank you . Wrong ones ? They sure as hell fit the description . No . The guy we 're looking for is a lot older . Where are they ? What have you done with them ? - Trooper , where are your prisoners ? - Wrong ones . We had to let them go . You what ? Shermin , you are finished . I will have you eviscerated for this . Well , as much as I hate to stoop to symbolism . I hear something . Give me your hand . All units , this is Fox . I want warning fire only . When ready , roger that . I copy . Here we go . Mrs. Hayden , you and your companion must stop immediately . Stop where you are or we will open fire . I repeat , stop where you are . We have orders to open fire . Last warning , Mrs. Hayden . You and your companion must stop immediately . We have orders to open fire . Last warning , Mrs. Hayden . For your own safety , you must stop where you are . What the hell is that ? I must go . Take me with you . - I cannot . - Please . You will die there . I don 't think I care . I care . Now tell me again how to say goodbye . Kiss me and tell me you love me . I love you . I 'm never going to see you again , am I ? No . I love you . Tell the baby about me . I will . What should I do with this ? The baby will know . Goodbye , Jenny Hayden . Goodbye .

No , claire , I don 't carry books with me . I have three books . Would you like to see them ? Sure . Have you read mark twain ? A little , in school . Did a report on tom sawyer once . I haven 't read that one . You haven 't ? That 's his most famous . I only have these . You can read ? Read this . [ Chuckles ] " What might it be that you 've got in the box ? " Then , smiley says , sort of indifferent , " " ' like it might be a parrot or it might be a canary maybe . " But it ain 't . It 's only just a frog . ' " [ Chuckles ] [ Chuckles ] ? All I wanna do is dance and have a good time ? ? [ Ends ] " So , the fella took the box and put up his $ 40 a load with smiley ... And sat down to wait . " [ Chuckles ] Mr. Swann . [ Sighs ] What 's this ? Uh , it was my great-great ... I don 't know , way back there someplace , great-grandfather 's . My grandmother stole it from him , as a reminder of one incredible night they had together . He took off , and she went to l.A. To find him and never did . She started her own business . Nobody remembers what . At least they ain 't saying . And became the great matriarch of the swann clan . She passed it on down to her granddaughter and on like that , till mom gave it to me when I was 21 . Anyway , it 's supposed to bring me luck . Does it work ? Does it ever . Kiss me again . [ Goats bleating ] Oh , quinn , what do you want ? He has to leave now . The marshalls , reese ... It 's too much trouble . That 's the best thing I 've heard . So , then he leaves .

Damn it , are you the cop or not ? [ Gunshots ] Don 't press me , boy . Padre here says you was a marshall . If you are , I need help . If not , just tell me . Ben , I know we 're alone , except for your friend . I don 't understand what 's going on here myself . I don 't like his smart mouth . Hey , look , I 'm sorry . I lost my temper . But somebody stole my bike . - His machine . - Okay , my machine . Someone took my machine . Why you telling that to us ? Well , if you are the marshalls , maybe you could do something , before whoever took it gets too far . Can 't you get on the radio ? What ? Jesus christ , don 't tell ... Hey , am I crazy ? Who are you people ? I want some answers . Where 's my machine ? Reese and dorsett . You know these guys ? We know ' em . Where are they ? - Swallows camp . - Swallows camp . Where is it ?

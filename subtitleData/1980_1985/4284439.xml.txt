 Help me , he 's going crazy ! Help me ! What do you want with Jack the Ripper ? I wanna capture him . You 're a reporter . I 'm Nellie Bly . Why don 't you become Sherlock Holmes and find Jack the Ripper ? I put an ad in the London Times daring him to meet me tonight . She 's meeting me . Winner take all ? No ! BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! ( CLOCK CHIMING ) ( DOOR OPENS ) ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) ( PLUMMETING ) You okay ? Where 'd he go ? Who ? The guy I fell on . I bounced off him , turned around , and he was gone . Just disappeared . JEFFREY : Hey , is she okay ? Looks like she fainted . I ... Maybe that guy that was here ... Where are we ? ( BEEPING ) November 19th , London , 1889 . I say , hello there ! Everything all right ? I think the lady here fainted . I think she was attacked or something . Attacked ? By whom ? Well , I really didn 't get a good look at him . We sort of dropped in and he just disappeared . Nonsense . He had to go somewhere . Here , hold that please . She 'll be all right . But I suggest we get her off the street . An American woman reporter has no business being in this neighborhood . How do you know she 's an American ? And a reporter ? The cloth of her coat , naturally . American coarse wool . My lamp , please . She 's obviously only a working woman , and her clothing is business-like and made for hard use . To be on this street at this time of night is not something a tourist would do . Rather , someone looking for a story . She carries a note pad and pencil , hence a reporter . Awesome . It 's elementary , really . ( MOANS ) I 've taken a flat in Baker Street . I suggest that we carry her there and see if we ... You 're not carrying me anywhere . You see ? An American . That 's one out of two . My dear young lady , as a doctor of medicine and a subject of the crown , I can tell you that you are in no condition to be wandering dark streets frequented by Jack the Ripper . Jack the Ripper ? Of course , Jack the Ripper . What do you think I 'm walking around here for , my health ? Where 's my gun ? BOGG : What do you want with Jack the Ripper ? I want to capture him . Find out who he is . Get his story . You 're a reporter . Two out of two , Bogg . My boy , it was elementary . I 'm Nellie Bly . So you 're that hotheaded headline grabber from New York . The one who risks her life to live through the situations on which she 's reporting . It 's the only way to get to the bottom of a story . I seriously doubt that . And while committing yourself to an insane asylum ... Or what was it ? Working in a vile New York sweat shop may seem romantic to you , I assure you , meeting Jack the Ripper would get you nothing but dead . I think that about does it here . We 've had enough excitement for tonight . Let us take the young lady back to my flat . Oh , I 'm not about ... You 're still a bit woozy , Miss Bly . Who are you ? Dr. Arthur Conan Doyle , and I can help you if you 'll let me . It 's just a few streets from here . Shall we ? JEFFREY : 221-B Baker Street . This is great ! This is just how I pictured it whenever I read Sherlock Holmes ' adventures . His adventure . Singular . I haven 't been able to write for a year . It would seem A Study in Scarlet will be the great Sherlock Holmes ' first and last foray into the unknown . No , it can 't . Sherlock Holmes is my favorite mystery detective . Mine , too . Why do you think I come up to London and set up a flat like this ? For inspiration ? Of course , for inspiration . Personally , I can 't stand the clutter . I had hoped that by living like Holmes , I might be able to break this damnable writer 's block and write him . Hasn 't helped , huh ? On the contrary , it 's worked beautifully . It has proven without a doubt that I should give up writing and concentrate on what I do best . Practicing medicine . Phineas Bogg ? You must be joking . Why would I do that ? Oh , come on . You know darn well that I 'm trying to break Phileas Fogg 's record of around the world in 80 days . It 's being carried by all the papers . Phileas Fogg ? Character in the book by Jules Verne . BOGG : Jules Verne ? He traveled around the world in 80 days . The French guy ? I met him once . Pulled him out of a brawl in Montmartre . I doubt that . He 's over 60 years old . Hey , Bogg , do you think he named the guy after ... I guess he had to . Anyway , I 'm not getting anywhere in this bed , so if you gents will excuse me ... There now , Miss Bly , drink this and try and lie back quietly for a few moments . Impossible , of course . You 've plenty of time to catch your boat or hot air balloon or whatever it is you 're traveling in . Boat . It leaves at midnight , but I 'm not going to be on it . It doesn 't matter anymore . It was just a stunt for some worldwide attention . I 'm glad you admit it . Look , I 'm the best reporter in my country , but over here , most of the papers won 't even run my stories . Maybe it 's my pride . I need to feel appreciated . I don 't know . But I 've always wanted something that would make the foreign press stand up and take notice . And now I 've got it . And it 's not just a stunt , but something that could do people some good . And I 've got to get back out on that street to do it . Why ? So you can meet up with Jack the Ripper again ? Of course . That was my plan . I was trying to get him to attack me . Now I 've heard everything . Perhaps her condition is worse than I thought . It may be funny to you , but I succeeded tonight in doing what Scotland Yard and London 's finest couldn 't . Narrowly escaping murder ? Luring the Ripper out of hiding . Six murders in six months and then nothing . He disappears . I should think that would be good riddance and we should leave it that . Fine , you leave it . But if you think I 'm going to pass up this story , you 're crazy . I 'm going to catch him . How ? By appealing to his pride , his conceit . As soon as I got here yesterday , I put an ad in the London Times daring him to meet me tonight at the scene of his crimes . Bravo . You succeeded . Wait a minute , Dr. Doyle , I think she 's onto something . Tell us all you remember . So you can steal my story ? No , so we can help you . You may be able to lure him out of hiding but you 're not going to be able to catch him alone . Well , I had just passed the Cock and Crown Pub , which I knew was the area where Ripper is believed to have spotted his victims . Big Ben . I remember hearing it strike 9 ... 00 . ( CLOCK CHIMING ) I turned this corner into a dark street . There was mist under the street lamps . The street looked empty , but I had this peculiar feeling I wasn 't alone . When I got about halfway , I thought I heard footsteps closing in behind me . I stopped , listened , no one was there . I started walking again . Have you ever entered a dark room and had the feeling you weren 't alone ? That someone , something was in there with you ? That 's the way I felt . I knew there was something behind me on that street . I wanted to scream but all I could do was go on . Then I heard them again , the footsteps . They were real and they were closing in . I stopped , pulled out the gun and turned . There was no one . I felt cold all over . I turned again and he grabbed me . I struggled and fainted . The next thing I remember is Mr. Bogg standing over me with you and the boy . Did you see the face of the man that attacked you ? No . All I saw was his black cape and some kind of shiny ... Watch with a ... DOYLE : A shiny watch with a what on it ? Nothing . There was nothing on it . ( SIGHING ) Dr. Doyle , would you mind terribly leaving the room ? I think I would like to rest . Of course . That 's the first sensible thing you 've said all night . Gentlemen ? You feel better , Nellie . We 'll help you catch that boat . NELLIE : Thanks . I 'll brew some tea while we wait . Great . Look , the way I see it , we got two problems . Jack the Ripper was never caught . After his sixth victim was found no one ever heard from him again , right ? JEFFREY : Right . Right . So we 've got to get Nellie to forget this Ripper stuff and complete the rest of her trip like she 's supposed to . JEFFREY : And Doyle 's got to break his writer 's block and get back to writing Sherlock Holmes . Yeah . Nellie ought to be a snap . All we gotta do is keep her up here until her boat leaves and stick her up . Doyle , now he 's gonna be trouble . Wrong , Bogg . What do you mean , " Wrong , Bogg " ? Doyle 's easy . He 's in the apartment . And where do you think Nellie is ? Looking for Jack the Ripper . That stupid girl 's gonna get herself killed . Do what you can with Doyle . I 'll be back as soon as I can . Nellie ! Nellie ! BOGG : Nellie ! Please , help me . Help , bobby . Bobby . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) MAN 1 : Looking for some company ? WOMAN : You 're in the wrong end of town , sweetie . Oh , alone she is now . Missy , what can I do for you this evening ? A bobby . I need a bobby . I 'm a bobby . Me too , ducky . MAN 2 : We 're all bobbies here , love . Even me , for a lady . ( ALL LAUGHING ) What do you want a bobby for ? You can read about it in the papers tomorrow . BARTENDER : Isn 't she the feisty one then ? Where I can find one ? Oh , right here . No , no , no , missy , it 's the truth . He always stops in here around 10 : 00 for a smoke and a pitch . He should be here in 10 minutes . Nellie ! Hi . Excuse me . Nellie , didn 't you hear me calling you ? Why 'd you duck out like that ? I said I wanted to help you . Well , if you really wanna to help me , you can buy me a cider . Are you kidding ? We 're not staying here . Yes , I am ! Hey , if the lady wants to stay she can stay . And she don 't need your company . The lady 's with me , all right ? ( MEN LAUGHING ) DOYLE : That girl ! In such a hurry . Didn 't even say goodbye . I wonder what her rush was . Off to get her story , I suppose . I can 't say I don 't envy her a bit . It would be wonderful to have the urge to pick up a pen . ( SIGHING ) All this inspiration and nothing in here . Had to have been something in there to create Sherlock . Oh , there was originally . But I 'll tell you , it 's almost as if he demanded to be written . Demanded ? During the process of creating him , the images came so hard and fast it was all I could do to get them down on paper . I began to feel he was almost impatient with my slowness . " Come on , " he seemed to be saying . " I 've got things to do . " There . Perhaps that 's my problem . I 'm talking about Holmes as if he were a living , breathing person . He always has been for me . Me , too , I 'm afraid . It 's as if I 've created a character more intelligent and alive than myself . I 'll tell you , he terrifies me . He scares you ? Intimidates is more the word . Yes . He intimidates me terribly . But that 's silly . I mean , he came from your mind . You created him . But every time I try to write , I feel him breathing down my neck . I end up thinking , " Sherlock , what would you say ? " Sherlock , is this too easy for you ? " Sherlock , is that case worthy ? " But you are Sherlock . I mean , he is a part of you . Look , I saw you collecting clues tonight at the scene after Nellie was attacked . Isn 't that something Sherlock would do ? I suppose . We do both have a curious nature . You have a curious nature . You gave it to him . I try to believe that , but he just overwhelms me . Then let him . What ? Let him overwhelm you . I mean , we 've got a perfectly good case right here in front of us . Worthy of him . Why don 't we bring the Sherlock out in you ? Why don 't you become Sherlock Holmes and find Jack the Ripper ? Look , Nellie , what if I told you I knew for sure you 'll never find the Ripper ? I 'd say you were lying . In fact , he could be in this pub right now for all we know . That 's a pretty good reason for us to get out of here , don 't you think ? No . That 's exactly why I have to stay . Of course . DRAKE ... The evidence that I produced proves that Phineas Bogg has purposely disobeyed all rules and regulations of the voyager code . BOGG ... Your evidence isn 't true , Drake . He 's the kind of voyager that weakens our ranks and is guilty as charged . Look , Drake ... Drake , that 's just one more lie . Voyager Drake has managed to make a career out of it . I do hope defense council understands that she will be held responsible for these accusations . I 'll be proud to . JUDGE : These pages are a record of the prosecution 's habit of falsely filing documents and tampering with the Omni memory recorder in order to convict innocent voyagers . Why , Drake ? Why ? Because it had to be done for the cause . The only cause you ever served was your own . And why would you be foolish enough to keep this incriminating evidence ? One day those words will vindicate me and all the work that I 've tried to do . The future shall judge me as a hero . Until then , you 'll deal with the judgments of this tribunal , and they shall be harsh . This court has no hold on me . Bailiff , stop that man . Hey , wait a minute , you 're not going anywhere . Stop him . DOYLE : I say , Watson , this is interesting . Come , have a look . What do you see ? JEFFREY : Dirt . Dirt now , previously mud . To be precise , clay-based mud . The type found on the threshold of the Cock and Crown where the pavement 's been torn up . Is that where you got it ? Why would I do that ? I scraped it from the footprints found at the scene of the crime . It means our man left the Cock and Crown just before attacking Miss Bly . But how can you be sure that the footprints were his ? There were no prints other than the victim 's , yours and Mr. Bogg 's . The fact that the attacker 's prints only lead to the crime and Mr. Bogg 's only lead away from it , I have not yet been able to deduce . When you came upon Miss Bly , did you notice anything ? Not really . It was pretty dark . Pity . Also extraordinary were the samples found from both yours and Mr. Bogg 's prints . Yeah ? Why ? Sand . Sand totally alien to England , to this part of the globe . Yes , I 'd place it somewhere in the northeastern segment of the Sahara . I 'm afraid it 's got me stumped . Well , he ... No , no , no , don 't tell me . I 'll get it eventually . I doubt it . What about this ? Oh , careful , dear Watson , careful . One must be careful with the evidence . Obliterating even the tiniest impression could destroy vital information . Fascinating , eh , Watson ? Fascinating . A gentleman , by the look of this . And one who carries a very sharp knife . You got that from this ? It 's quite elementary . Here , look again . See this indentation ? Mmm-hmm . It 's from a holder further augmented by the fact there are no teeth impressions . The affectation of a gentleman , perhaps a bit of a fop . Notice the clean slice . It was nipped with a well-honed blade . Not a penknife . No , something fine , a professional instrument . A scalpel , maybe . The doctor in you , Watson . So it 's all falling into place , then . Our gentleman took Miss Bly up on her challenge , had a leisurely smoke at the Cock and Crown , and once she passed the pub , left in pursuit . A cold-blooded man I 'd say , continued to smoke during the attempt on the young girl 's life . Fantastic . Elementary , Watson . And now for a closer look at those odd shoes of yours . ( CLOCK CHIMING ) Now , I better move on . It 's been over 20 minutes . That 's 20 minutes too long . Now let 's get out of here ... You said he 'd be here in 10 . Oh , it ain 't my fault , missy . Who 'd be here ? Sometimes when he 's running behind he passes us by . Moves on up to the Boar 's Head on Bleecker . Now who 's he talking about , Nellie ? You meeting somebody here ? That 's right , mate . She 's meeting me . Watch it , Alf . He 's a big one . For one . But not for all of us . I 've a feeling we shouldn 't have stopped for cider . Winner take all ? MAN : Get him , boys ! BOGG : Nellie ! Police ! Bobby ! MAN : Someone calling ? NELLIE : Help me , please ! He 's in the pub , hurry . Who is , miss ? Hold it right there , gents ! Great timing , Nellie . All right , miss . Which one is he ? There ! That one . The one in the middle . That man is Jack the Ripper . All right . Get him out . We 'll be going upstairs with the bloke . I say , Watson , the deeper I delve , the more baffling these shoes become . Why , this is a piece of quartz . The variety of which , I believe , is found only in the most remote reaches of the South American jungle . A sequoia pine needle . My boy , you do get around ! How ? Well , you see ... No , no , no , don 't tell me , don 't tell me . I 'll get it . I 'II ... ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) OFFICER : Open up . Scotland Yard . Bogg . I say , what 's going on here ? This young lady here accuses this gentleman of being Jack the Ripper . What ? Can you believe this ? Nellie , I was just ... Don 't play innocent . You attacked me once tonight . And when I left this apartment you followed me to the Cock and Crown to finish me off . I was trying to help you . To my grave . You were afraid I 'd turn you in and I have . Nellie Bly has taken Jack the Ripper off the streets for good . Oh , boy . Inspector Lestrod , Miss Bly here tells me you two gentlemen were at the scene of the crime and might be able to provide some corroborative evidence . And he was very anxious to see you . That 's because he 's innocent . The boy is right , Inspector . This is not your man . And may I ask your name , sir ? Doyle . Dr. Arthur Conan Doyle . Doyle ? He 's a writer . He wrote A Study ... A Study in Scarlet . Yes , I know that book . That made Scotland Yard look like a bunch of ninnies . Which is precisely the way they will look if you insist on convincing an innocent man . Well , since the facts prove his guilt , you must be basing your judgment solely on appearances . I am . Well , appearances can be deceptive . On the contrary . It is often the observation of the outside which provides the solution . For example , Inspector , I see by your hat that you are a bachelor , your parents are alive , that your mother is a generous woman and your father is a wealthy self-made man . Am I accurate ? Completely . All right , how did you do that ? Elementary , really . Your hat has a fine layer of dust on it . House dust . Of the type that a wife would routinely brush off for her husband . A bachelor . The hat is also of a quality far above the rest of your clothing . Why ? Watson ? It 's a gift . Must be a gift . Very good . From whom ? Only someone 's mom would give him a hat . Christmas . So impractical , mum . ( CHUCKLING ) Hey , Watson , not bad . All right , then , all right . Just get on . Tell us , how do you know my parents are still alive ? And that my father was a wealthy , self-made man ? Simple matter of deduction , my good man . Were your parents dead , you would have inherited some of that wealth which was able to afford a hat like that . The rest of your attire would be of equal quality . That your father is a self-made man is obvious . There are only two reasons for a man to withhold his wealth from his son . Watson ? One reason is they didn 't like him . But I don 't think that 's it . Because if they didn 't like him , they wouldn 't have given him the hat . Correct . Which leads us to the final reason and deduction that Inspector Lestrod 's father believes hard work is the only way to wealth . The way he acquired his . Bravo , Doctor , bravo . Very amusing . But then we 're not here to try me , are we ? No . We came here for Jack the Ripper . Well , don 't look at me . I 'd like to get to the bottom of this , too . And we shall . Inspector , allow me to present the evidence which shows Mr. Bogg 's innocence . Watson , the cigar . There you go . Thank you . This was found at the scene of the crime . The people I came upon didn 't smoke . Well , Miss Bly doesn 't smoke and young Jeffrey doesn 't smoke , but he could . But he doesn 't . ( SNIFFING ) Smoke free . ( SNIFFING ) No nicotine stains on the hands and smile , Mr. Bogg . Clean , white teeth . This man does not smoke . The cigar could 've been dropped earlier this evening by someone else . I doubt it . The cigar was still smoking . The dampness of the street would have doused a cigar very quickly . No . I believe it was held by Miss Bly 's attacker . Let us see if we can prove this further . Mr. Bogg , Miss Bly . What is it ? We are going to reenact the attack . Wonderful . Your gun , Miss Bly . Here Mr. Bogg , hold this . Now , Miss Bly , how close was your attacker when you turned around with your gun ? Just a few feet away . He was practically on top of me . Oh , come on , will you give Doyle and me a chance ? When she turns around , grab her . Place one hand on the gun , the other on her neck . That correct , Miss Bly ? That 's right . He took the gun away . Very well , my dear , you may begin . Hold it ! NELLIE : What does this prove ? If he 's doing what I think he is doing it could prove the attacker was smoking that cigar . I understand why you want the Ripper but I can 't understand why you want it to be me . Come here , Inspector . There ! A burn . Where the ember knocked the sleeve . I see that . So ? It 's just been made . Would you remove your hand , please , Mr. Bogg ? BOGG : But that mark wasn 't . It was made earlier this evening by Miss Bly 's attacker . A smoker and someone four inches shorter than Mr. Bogg . That man is also in possession of Miss Bly 's pistol . If you search Mr. Bogg , Inspector , I will assure you , you will find not a thing . Admit it , Nellie , you were wrong about me . One cigar burn doesn 't prove you 're innocent . You could have dropped the gun anywhere . And what about the other evidence ? What about that thing on your belt ? BOGG : This ? She saw that on her attacker , Mr. Bogg . Can I see it ? Please be careful with it , would you ? It 's my grandfather 's . The V. I saw a flash of silver and that V. And then I fainted . INSPECTOR : V ? Like you saw on this one ? Yes . And the cape . The attacker wore a cape just like his . Wait a minute , this cape is not mine . Look , the clasp broke when I grabbed him . Could be , Mr. Bogg . But can you tell me why there was only one set of footprints leading to the crime and then again just one set leaving ? And can you explain how you just appeared , and how your attacker just disappeared ? Doctor ? I 'm afraid the only person with that answer is Mr. Bogg . What if I told you that device can make you appear and disappear ? It sounds mad , but it would explain it . It is mad . Utter nonsense . Take him to the Yard . JEFFREY : No , you can 't , he 's not the Ripper . And you , son , I 'd like you to come along with me . I think I 'd like to question you some more . No ! He 's innocent . No . WOMAN : They say it 's Jack the Ripper . That 's right . He 's in there . I heard one of the bobbies say it . The gallows is too good for him . Well , I 'd like to see him swing . Yes ! String him up ! String him up ! String him up ! Hang him ! To the graveyard with him ! Don 't worry , Watson . I 'll think of something . Right . Give it that old Sherlock try . LESTROD : Come on , son , get inside . Tomorrow morning the papers will proclaim , " The Streets Are Safe Again . " How can you be so sure ? I thought we just proved that . What we proved was that most of your evidence was circumstantial . I couldn 't explain one or two things . Pretty big things . You know , I remember reading about you , Nellie Bly . About how you exposed the terrible treatment of the mentally ill , and about your stories ending the awful abuse of the kids working in the factory sweat shops . Wait a minute . The thing that impressed me most about you , the thing I really , really respected was how you got to the bottom of your stories . How you dug your facts up . How you 'd go to any length to expose the truth . Now that Nellie Bly was a good reporter . A great reporter . I admired her . And this Nellie Bly ? This one 's stunting . Going for the obvious , for what 's fast and easy . For what 'll grab the headlines , huh ? She says she 's out to serve the public , but she 's really just out to serve herself . And I really am sorry . Oh , I 'm not Jack the Ripper , Nellie . But he 's out there . You ought to be more careful . Take care of her , Doc . ( CROWD CLAMORING ) Straight to the Yard . ( CLOCK CHIMING ) Well , Miss Bly , it 's a quarter past eleven . In one night you 've done what Scotland Yard and the entire London police force couldn 't accomplish in a year . You captured Jack the Ripper . Have I ? Or was it just a stunt ? Well , you seem to have convinced Inspector Lestrod . Your boat leaves in 45 minutes . Shall I escort you ? Yes . But not to my boat . Then where ? To the Cock and Crown . ( MAN YELLING ) I don 't understand it . How could she have seen the Omni before she passed out ? DRAKE ... Phineas Bogg . It 's been a long time since we met last . BOGG ... I could 've gone a few more centuries without seeing you , Drake . A lot has changed around here . Yeah . It looks like a new Omni . Model 3-1650 , silver case , open-time calibration , state-of-the-art . JEFFREY : Bogg ? Bogg ? You okay , Bogg ? Another Omni . What ? The guy I landed on just disappeared into thin air , right ? Yeah . What if he used an Omni ? But Nellie said she saw a flash of silver . That 's right . And the only person I know that has a silver Omni ... Is Drake . DRIVER : Get up there ! Go on ! DOYLE : We 'd better hurry , Nellie . Bogg is right . These streets are particularly dangerous for you and me . DRIVER : Hurry up , get on now ! What 's Drake doing here ? You don 't think he could be the Ripper ? No , that 's not his style . But fouling up history for revenge is . So that 's why he 's after Nellie . To make sure she wouldn 't complete her trip . Yeah , and he wound up with me as a bonus . And if I got to Nellie like I think I did , she 's on her way to the Cock and Crown . Start screaming . What ? I gotta get to Drake before he gets to Nellie . Start screaming like I 'm beating you or something . Help ! Help me , he 's going crazy ! Help me ! Louder , keep it up ! JEFFREY : Ow ! He 's hitting me , help me ! Whoa . Inspector , Inspector , the boy 's yelling his head off in there . What the devil 's going on ? All right , son ! Well , open it ! JEFFREY : Help me , he 's hurting me , help ! Go , Bogg ! Go after him ! ( WHISTLE BLOWING ) Get after him ! Yes , sir . MAN : Hurry up now . Hurry up ! Come on ! I have that feeling again . Someone 's behind us . DOYLE : There 's no one there . No , stop . I could have sworn . No , you 're right . There is someone back there . Hurry , Nellie , run ! Hurry , Nellie , up to your left . DOYLE : There he is . I see him ! Here . Up here . Nellie ! Nellie ! Wrong alley , Miss Bly , Dr. Doyle . This one 's a dead end . Come out , Miss Bly . I 'm only trying to return your gun . Don 't you believe me ? He 's up there , off to the right ! DRAKE : You know , Miss Bly , I can 't believe my luck . Nellie Bly , Arthur Conan Doyle and Phineas Bogg . Three birds with one stone . Now don 't misunderstand me . I 'm not your Jack the Ripper . My life is dedicated to ruining history , not people . You , Miss Bly , were just a piece of history to obliterate . Nellie ! But when my friend Bogg showed up , the stakes changed . There you are . Now where is the good doctor ? Here ! NELLIE : No ! Don 't ! Help ! Someone help ! Now , you get your gun . No ! Oh , no , Bogg . It 's not that easy . ( WHISTLE BLOWING ) Hold it there ! That 's quite enough , Mr. Bogg ! Thought you 'd come back and finish Nellie off , did you ? Bogg ! On the contrary , Inspector , Mr. Bogg saved Miss Bly . Is that true ? Yes . Yes , it is . But there 's only you and Doyle in this alley . Who did he save you from ? From the man who attacked me earlier tonight . The one I mistook for Mr. Bogg . Well , where is he ? I can only report what I saw , Inspector . And what I saw was a man who disappeared . DOYLE : There ! I 've got it ! Sahara sand , South American quartz , sequoia needle . There 's only one way you could have picked up all these on this shoe . How ? A visit to the Royal Zoological Gardens . Correct , Watson ? You amaze me , Sherlock . Forget , Sherlock . That came out of Doyle 's head . That pipe-smoking aristocrat 's never going to get the best of me again . For the last time , Nellie , the answer is no . A short interview is all I 'm asking . Now , I saw that man touch his device and disappear . You 've got one , that means you can disappear . Nellie , there you go telling stories again . Have you ever seen me disappear ? Who are you ? What do you do ? Look , Lestrod was able to delay your boat an hour . If you don 't leave now , you could blow the whole record . You 're not going to tell me , are you ? No . After all we 've been through , you 'd deny me an exclusive ? Absolutely . Then can I do one thing ? That depends . That you can do . Thanks for keeping me in line . Ambition 's fine , as long as it doesn 't get in the way of reporting . Hear , hear . Thank you , Doctor . Jeffrey . Bon voyage , Nellie . Say hi to Jules for me . Dr. Doyle , can I make you some tea ? ( DINGS ) Maybe help you out with some of the Watson stuff ? Hey , come back in a month or so . You can be the first to read it . Forget it . Huh ? I already have . JEFFREY ... If you wanna learn more about Arthur Conan Doyle or the Sherlock Holmes stories , Nellie Bly or Jack the Ripper , take a voyage down to your public library .

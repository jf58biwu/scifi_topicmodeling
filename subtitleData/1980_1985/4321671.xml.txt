 Nobokov . JO : Who is Nobokov , anyway ? KGB 's best . Has been for years . JO : He 's the Russian who saved Locke 's life . We remain locked in with the gas until it is dumped . Now , we can do this the easy way or my way . And if the gas leaks ? The whole central nervous system evaporates . I 'm just playing by the rules . SKYWATCH : We have a Code Red . I have a runaway train . NOBOKOV : I won 't let Randolph get you . I 'll kill you myself . I don 't believe it . A boxcar full of poison gas and they 're probably arguing about who climbs in first . They 'll sort it out . Yeah . I 'd feel better if they 'd dump the stuff first and discuss it later . We 'll all relax when it 's destroyed . Nobokov . SAINT JOHN : Damn . Look , I 'll ride with him . You take the Lady . No way . Why would you volunteer to be locked up with Darth Vader for 25 hours ? To keep him and Locke from killing each other . Locke . Gregori . Karlovich was scheduled to make this run . The home office needed him . Then I take it you 've been briefed on the nature of the gas and the shielded train car . I understand there is only one way in or out and we remain locked in with the gas until it is dumped . That 's right . ( DOOR OPENS ) We still don 't know these cylinders contain the gas in question . Your scientific crew saw it loaded . They chose the numbers for your part of the valve locks . I have the remaining numbers . Let 's get on with it , then . ( DOOR CLOSES ) All doors secure . Let 's go . Now , like the man said , let 's get moving . We 've got a lot of territory to cover . SAINT JOHN : Your ETA to first black hole is 30 minutes . LOCKE : Roger . Time check and position confirmed . And we have no unaccounted for personnel in the Milkrun red zone . Let 's keep it that way . Milkrun out . Russian roulette 's a personal affair . One bullet into any of these cylinders and millions could die . I still have no proof you or your country is telling the truth about what 's in these cylinders . An even if you did , would you believe it ? As I told you a long time ago , Jason , agents stay alive on distrust . You gotta trust somebody some time . Everything checks out . I just need your signature here , as the observer . Still a glutton for procedure , too , I see . I thought I taught you , routines are killers . This isn 't Tel Aviv and I 'm not a junior agent anymore . Ten years has changed both of us . Don 't let me spoil it for you , Gregori , but I 'm out here to get a job done , not to rehash old business . Okay , spill it . What ? Well , the Russian and Locke . They were as abrasive as a couple pieces of sandpaper back there . Who is Nobokov , anyway ? KGB 's best . Has been for years . He 's the Russian who saved Locke 's life . But he 's been trying to take it back ever since . MIKE : Locke must have told you why . You know Locke . He said , " Stay out of it ! " Wolf Point , this is Dustbuster . Wolf Point . This is Dustbuster . We 're at Checkpoint One . Roger , Dustbuster . How 's it look ? Clean outside . We 're proceeding into black hole . SAINT JOHN : Roger , Dustbuster . We have you at black hole . We 're running point to Check Two . Skywatch will pick up here . Affirmative , Wolf Point . Dustbuster out . Ten years hasn 't changed anything . Your King 's still in jeopardy . Nevertheless , I 'll win . I assume the air-conditioning can stand a cigarette . It 's your lungs . Hmm . Not nearly as lethal as poison gas or a friend turning Judas on you . A friend doesn 't ask a man to do something that will cause a village full of innocent people to be blown to smithereens . Check . I 'm Colonel David Randolph . What 's your name , soldier ? Lieutenant Robin Walters . Well , Lieutenant Walters , I don 't imagine you 'd wanna wave that surveillance chopper on over when it comes by . No , sir . I couldn 't . That 's too bad . ( GUN FIRING ) RANDOLPH : Get that camouflage down and get the barricades up in the tunnel . Now ! Take command of that cab , Jenson . We got three minutes to get that train lined up . SKYWATCH : Skywatch to Airwolf , we have an ETA of three minutes . You guys can move on down the line and let the experts take over , all right ? ( LAUGHS ) That 's a negative , Skywatch . SKYWATCH : Please say again , Airwolf ? We read negative on changeover . That was affirmative on changeover . Negative on experts . SKYWATCH : Didn 't copy that , Airwolf . Request status report . We have a preliminary Code Green on black hole , Skywatch . I need visual contact with ground unit . Confirm ? Roger , Airwolf . We 'll wave to them for you and see you at Check Two . Skywatch , out . All right , we 've got 200 miles worth of snooping to cover fast . MIKE : Turbos ready . Engage ! So much for your check . Let 's keep it casual , now . Dustbuster to Skywatch . Dustbuster to Skywatch , over . SKYWATCH : We read you . Code Green on Check Two . Train will enter black hole in five minutes . A billion dollars worth of new hardware and the codes remain the same . The system needs to change , Jenson . It 's people like you and me that are gonna make it happen . Yes , sir ! Let 's go . SKYWATCH : Milkrun , this is Skywatch . We confirm Code Green at Check Two . LOCKE : Roger . Keep the safety zone clear . Our companies agreed . Your air strike team was to cover my ground units and destroy that terrorist training camp . But I told you what I had learned . That wasn 't just a terrorist training camp . That village was full with women and children and old men . Not according to my contacts ! Well , your contacts were wrong . You could have waited until the terrorists made a move . I had my orders ! I saved your life , Jason . I expected you to back me . I would have done anything . Except murder those innocent people . So six of my best agents get cut down . That 's murder in my book . ( HORN BLOWING ) ( SQUEAKING ) ( CRASHING ) Okay , men ! ( GROANS ) Locke ! Locke ! What kind of Company trick is this ? You don 't get off so easy . Do you hear me ? We haven 't settled up . Give me your card . Give it to me . I 'll put a stop to this charade . You never intended to dump any gas . I don 't care what you believe . We 're not opening that door . Locke to Skywatch . Do you read me ? Engine , come in . Do you read me ? Damn ! Antenna must have been cut . All set ? Yes , sir . She redlines at 50 miles an hour . ( BEEPING ) SKYWATCH : What are they doing ? Crawling ? Come on out , you guys , come on ! ( HISSING ) SKYWATCH : Contact ! Here she comes . Airwolf , we finally have visual contact with Milkrun . How 's it look on our end ? Every railroad tie intact . Let 's go . SKYWATCH : Skywatch to Milkrun . We 're your new nurses . Milkrun , this is Skywatch , please respond . ( BEEPING ) All right , move it out ! LOCKE : Drop your gun , Gregori . No . You want to shoot it out here or deal with whoever 's outside first ? Gas transport car , this is change of command . We need that door opened up now . Identify yourself . Colonel David Randolph . I want that gas , gentlemen ! Now we can do this the easy way or my way . Forget it , Randolph ! We 've got protection overhead . Not since we gave them another train to chase . You 're all alone . SKYWATCH : I 'm reading their speed at 30 miles an hour . Airwolf , we are unable to make radio contact with Milkrun . We 're going to Code Yellow . Request instructions . This Skywatch Code Yellow bothers me . I vote we turn around and go back . That makes it unanimous . Light a fire under us . You open that door or we cut you out . And I warn you , that gas doesn 't like heat . This is Jason Locke , Randolph , and you can go to hell . There 's a town just 12 miles downwind . That 's about 150,000 people that might join us there . Then call this stunt off . Look , Locke , I headed the team that made this gas . Our country spent a lot of time and money and I 'm not about to see it go to waste . Cut it open ! Remember , men , when we get inside , we do not , I repeat , we do not kill those men . I need them alive . ( BEEPING ) SKYWATCH : Airwolf , this is Skywatch Command . We read you , Skywatch . Try to establish visual contact with the motor man . SKYWATCH : Airwolf , we have visual contact . Transport car appears secure . Wait a minute , hold it ! We have a Code Red . Say again , we have a Code Red . I have a runaway train . Skywatch , this is Airwolf . We read Code Red . Give us coordinates . SKYWATCH : Transmitting . I 've got the train on the monitor . It 's 22 miles up the track . SAINT JOHN : Hit the afterburners , Mike . Lf , given , there is gas in these tanks , how much heat will they take ? About the same as us . What 's the temperature now ? 106 . What happened to the cooling system ? The heat from Randolph 's torches probably blew it . And if the gas leaks ? Holding your breath doesn 't help . It hits the skin and the whole central nervous system evaporates . Locking on to train . He 's right below us . Hold it . I 've got a maximum heat source reading from the cab . Got it . ( BEEPING ) MIKE : It 's burning up the tracks . Skywatch , what do you have ? SKYWATCH : Two men in the cab . Two dead men . No respiratory indications and their body temperature is dropping . I 'm not getting any life signs from the gas car . The canisters must have ruptured . SKYWATCH : What 's the plan , Airwolf ? We 're going in for a closer look . It 'll be just a short while , Colonel . That 's right . And then we save this country from making one of the biggest mistakes in history , Jenson . One thing , Locke . What 's that ? I won 't let Randolph get you . I 'll kill you myself . ( BEEPING RAPIDLY ) SKYWATCH : Airwolf , we read Milkrun 's speed at 48 miles per hour and climbing . Anything on the audio scan ? Nothing . Not even ambient sound . It 's like there wasn 't even a radio onboard . All right , I 'm set . Nothing fancy out there . Are you kidding ? And blow my chance to drive a train ? Heat source could be a bomb . Don 't leave yet . ( BEEPING RAPIDLY ) JO : Mike ! Mike ! Mike ! The train . It 's gone , man ! SKYWATCH : Airwolf , this is Skywatch . We have a Code Omega . We are not sealed . Leaving the area . Airwolf , are you trimmed for toxic fallout ? Roger . We are over the site , checking for gas contamination levels and scanning for survivors . SKYWATCH : We need weather data from you immediately , Airwolf . Skywatch , transmit data on the molecular structure of the gas and we 'll track it for you . SKYWATCH : Acknowledged , Airwolf . Now , scan for Locke . No one 's down there , Saint John . Do it anyway , damn it ! Roger . There 's nobody alive down there , Saint John . Nobody . Okay , men . I 'm gambling that you won 't risk anything that could blow one of those tanks . Think about it , Locke . Mr. Russian . That 's an insane threat . No more insane than nations threatening each other with nuclear weapons . Not as insane as acts of terrorism . The whole world 's insane , Locke . I 'm just playing by the rules . Now , throw out those weapons . They 'll have card keys to the cabinet . Find them and start unloading . Take ' em away . It doesn 't check out . I 've got problems here , too . Run an internal diagnostic . Roger . We ran a full onboard diagnostic this morning . What 's wrong ? MIKE : The train made like Mount Saint Helens . The atmosphere should be full of nerve gas . So , how bad is it drifting ? It 's not . According to our computers , there 's no gas at all . You 're telling me there never was any gas ? Not on that train . ( SOLDIERS CHATTERING ) Careful , soldier . What kind of agent have you grown into , Locke ? The kind that takes risks or forces them on others ? The cautious kind . Until I know I have my best shot . This would be a rotten time to play hero . I 've never played hero in my life until you forced it on me in Tel Aviv . The Cold War goes on even here , I see . Gentlemen , when I get these tanks loaded , I need one more thing . The valve lock combinations . That 's tough . Not with sodium amytal . Think about it . I 'll get my answers no matter what you decide . SKYWATCH : What you 're saying is impossible , Airwolf . Then call it a miracle or a mistake , Skywatch . There is no gas ! SKYWATCH : I can 't accept that answer . Report back to base for a diagnostics check . Look , we already ran one . There 's nothing wrong with us or with that coyote down there on the ground . SKYWATCH : Nothing could have survived that gas . I supervised loading Locke 's train myself . Then this pile of scraps wasn 't Locke 's train . A switch ? Like a shell game and I think I know where the shell is . SKYWATCH : Wait for backups , Airwolf . That 's an order ! Sorry , Skywatch , but we didn 't copy that last order . You must have radio problems . Checkpoint Two ? Roger . Let 's find Locke . When you finish unloading the train , put it and the jeep in the tunnel . That should keep investigators confused until we leave , Colonel . Mmm-hmm . You know , Jenson , right now we hold the security of this country in our hands . Get out ! I 'll cover you . ( NOBOKOV GRUNTING ) ( MUMBLING ) Damn it ! Patch this one so we can have a little talk before he bleeds to death . I think I 've got something . Gunfire , very weak . Source ? Couldn 't make it out . ( GROANS ) Any sign of life down there ? Around the mountain ? Negative . SAINT JOHN : And inside ? You don 't want much , do you ? I want Locke , alive ! Take a look at your screen . There 's our train , but no sign of activity around it . That mountain is riddled with old tunnels and abandoned mines . See if you can zero in on anything in them . Widening scan . JO : Whoo ! That rock 's playing hell with the sensors . Hey ! Those combo locks on the canisters gave out a little VH signal , didn 't they ? Homing devices . MIKE : Well , I just homed in on them . There , in that cave . Can you hear me , Russian ? Yeah . What is your name ? Gregori Nobokov . RANDOLPH : And you work for the Russian government ? I worked for KGB . You don 't work for them now ? ( GRUNTS ) Last assignment ... Last chance to kill Locke . Get him talking and keep him going till I get what I need . Skywatch , this is Airwolf . We 've located the gas . SKYWATCH : And Locke 's train ? Roger . But they 're not together . The train 's in the tunnel . The gas is in what appears to be a large mine entrance . Do you copy , Skywatch ? SKYWATCH : Loud and clear , Airwolf . If any of those canisters have even been partially compromised , they must be disposed of immediately . You want us to bury it there without going in after Locke ? SKYWATCH : He 'd order it up himself . Look , I can scramble a squadron of F-14s if you don 't want to do the job . We can do it . Airwolf , out . Saint John , we can 't just ... We follow orders . But first , we find Locke . Way to go . Let me out . I 'll start a recon . You fly . I 'll hit the ground . Find any vents out of that mine . We have to seal them off before we can bury it . I 'll hit them with X-9 rockets . Give me 12 minutes , then blow the vents . Locke . Why do you want to kill Locke ? He didn 't back me up . ( GROANS ) I lost six agents . Gregori , you know a secret about the gas . Yes . If you tell Locke the secret , he won 't be able to keep it quiet . No . You must tell ... Your superiors would want you to tell . Yes . My half of the combination . Y-G-N T-U-R . ( WHEEZES ) Now , it 's your turn , Locke . Sir , Relling reports a chopper is nosing around outside the tunnel . Keep an eye on it . We only need a few more minutes . A timed sequence . The first three rockets cave in the lower tunnels . The next three collapse the mountain . We 'll be waiting . Be back in 15 minutes . If I 'm not , bury the works . Skywatch , this is Airwolf . We 're laying the charges . SKYWATCH : Affirmative , Airwolf . Ready on one . Fire one . Ready on two and three . Fire two . That chopper is sealing up the mountain . Then shoot it down ! Yes , sir . Take this man to the truck . Leave the Russian . Incoming . Three , no , four Stinger missiles . Try to crack their fix on us , Mike . Affirmative . Enable sunbursts . That 's all of them . Let 's return the favor . I want that combination , Locke ! I want it now ! Like I said before , tough ! SAINT JOHN : Drop the gun ! Stay there ! Let 's go . We 've got two minutes . Wait . If it had leaked , we would have been dead five seconds ago . You don 't know how many times I said that today . Airwolf to Skywatch , the gas is no longer a threat . I repeat , the gas ... SKYWATCH : We read you , Airwolf . And Locke ? He 's A-okay . We 'll be going home . SKYWATCH : That 's a roger , Airwolf . Over and out . If you need me , I 'm right behind you . Gregori . You asked to meet . I expected you on time , at least . Somebody once taught me , make the other guy wait . It gives you the edge . The important lessons you didn 't forget , I see . They told me you 're going home tonight . Yes . As much as I like your American nurses ... You could have left me in that mountain . So , a life for a life . We have a draw on our hands . Gregori , I 'm sorry about the people that you lost in Tel Aviv . Take care of your people , Jason . They 're the ones you 'll remember when you forget everything else . You take care of yourself , you hear ? For you . Check . You 'll mail his move to Moscow .

 I 'm Howard K. Smith , and this is the state of the war tonight . We 've just received word that Bangkok has fallen . Despite valiant resistance from the Thais ... as well as armed refugees from occupied Vietnam ... the firepower of the Visitors proved too much to overcome . Nevertheless , the fight for Southeast Asia goes on . On the home front , the citizens of Birmingham , Alabama ... met force with force , as the Visitors attempted to subdue the city ... once known as the Pittsburgh of the south . Employing guerrilla tactics , carrying the fight to the streets ... the residents maneuvered the aliens into a position ... near the massive Blackwell oil refinery . Then they set it afire . At this hour , the fire rages out of control ... and it is said that you can hear the rebel yell in the streets of Dixie tonight . The most recipient of the Freedom Network 's medal of valor ... proves that one man can make a difference . Dr. Harvey Wachman , of Kansas city , Missouri ... freed a dozen young boys from a Visitor youth corps camp ... got them to Chicago , where they were reunited with their families . Dr. Wachman , we salute you . And that 's where we stand tonight . From the Freedom Network in New York , our hopes are with you . Good night . Good morning , all you gophers . It 's time to get to work . Do a little digging for Diana . Step up there in the truck . Hurry it up . Come on . Get up in there . Come on , gophers ... gotta get you to go dig for some cobalt . You guys roust that house . Come on , people , let 's move it . We 're gonna do a little digging , today . Gonna get you in shape , get a workout . If you 're lucky , you might get something to eat . Come on , Grandpa , pick it up . Come on , Richard , get up . What 's wrong with you ? We ain 't got all day . He can 't go back to the mines . - If he works another day , it 'll kill him . - Is that right , Doctor ? Well , then , Richard , I guess you 're free . Go on . Keep going . Don 't ever tell me what I can or can 't do . Dad ! Look what we 've got here . You 're a tough little monkey . You wanna join the gang ? Looks like you 're the only real man around here . - You want us to get her ? - No , don 't worry about her . There 's only one road in and out of town . The lizards will take care of her . Get them people to the mine . We don 't want to keep Diana waiting . Amon , please ... I need you . I 've killed . Where are you ? Here . I 've broken my oath . - Betrayed the covenant . - Whom did you kill ? I 'm a medic . Just back from a place called Charleston . The fighting was terrible . I went to help a man . He misunderstood , tried to kill me . I just reacted . I didn 't mean to . I understand your anguish , my son . - You must help yourself . - I can 't , without you . - When will you come ? - In time . For now , Zon teaches compassion for others . Offer it to yourself . - I can 't . - You must . Now , quickly . The covenant . " Zon is the cause for which I would die ... " but there is no cause for which I would kill . " Our southern thrust is stalled . The commanders in Tampa are reporting their weapons are almost out of cobalt . - It could delay our ground offensive . - I disagree . I won 't allow you to undermine our entire war effort . You forget who 's in charge here , Lydia . You were ordered to locate the origin of the renegade priest 's transmission . You don 't have to remind me . I have an appointment . See that the follower of Zon is brought to my quarters . We 'll finish this discussion later . You know , if we start serving at about 5 : 00 , 5 : 30 ... we 'll turn another 10 , 15 tables , before the 9 : 00 curfew shuts us down . Excuse me . We won 't be serving for another hour and a half . I didn 't come for a meal . - What can I do for you ? - I need your help . - You can trust him . - I have to find the Resistance . Resistance ? So why come to me ? Because you were one of them . It was in all the magazines . I just thought ... That was a long time ago . All I know about the Resistance now is what 's in the papers . Sorry . Look , I 'm talking to you about a whole town that 's enslaved . The men are being worked to death in a cobalt mine for Diana . Look , there 's nothing I can do for you . And the other half are dying of radiation . - Come back some time tomorrow . - Tomorrow 's too late . - It 's the best I can do . - Oh , I see . Now that you 're a big-time restaurant owner ... real people don 't matter to you . Look , lady , I don 't know who you are , or where you come from . You come waltzing in here off the street , talking to me about the Resistance ... for all I know , you could be a lizard . It 's red , not green . And a lot more will be spilt if you don 't help . Bring her in . I don 't like this . - Let 's hear her out . - It 's just one town . The whole world 's at war . We got enough to do right here . Here . Sit . All right . You convince us , we 'll convince the rest . Well , there are only about 30 families left . Everybody 's scared . They 're afraid to breathe . Afraid to come out into the light . If you don 't help us , we 've got no place to go . - Why don 't you fight ? - With what , our bare hands ? If the people don 't do as they are told , then their families die . And if that 's not enough for you ... when Diana gets her hands on that cobalt ... she 'll have enough laser ammo ... to blow the World Liberation Front right into the sea . Talk is cheap . We 've got no reason to believe you . - Except that I 'm asking you to . - You 're asking a lot . We vote . - I say we go . - No . We can 't let them get that cobalt . Let 's do it . This is a big mistake . Look , are you in or out , or what ? Can you get us into town without being seen ? The town is well covered ... but at night we might be able to make it across the lake . All right . But we 'll need explosives to blow that mine . We can get that with Julie 's connections . Will the townspeople help us ? Well , there are a few in jail that might , but everybody else ... they 're just teachers and clerks , they 're not fighters . Neither were we . Yeah , Mr. Mike , it 's Julie . Listen , I checked my aunt 's itinerary this morning . She 's visiting Dover on the fourth . Could you see her off for me ? Sounds explosive , the fourth in Dover . Yeah . Listen , I gotta go . Have a blast . Bye . Working late ? Hi , Nathan . It 's just easier to concentrate at night . I wish all my employees were as dedicated as you . - What are you working on ? - I 'll show you . I 've isolated the power source of the Visitor laser pistol ... and it seems to have a cobalt base . But the molecular structure is so irregular ... it seems almost impossible to reconstruct . Oh , well , nothing 's impossible . Not even a traitor at Science Frontiers . What ? The Resistance raided another munitions van this morning . You think they were tipped ? Well , I had four other vans as decoys . None of them were hit . I kept the routes on a computer disc in my safe . Is the disc missing ? No , but someone must have copied it . Well , Nathan , I hope you find whoever this person is . Oh , I will . You know ... it would go a lot easier on the person if they would just come forward . I might even drop the charges ... if they 'd work on my side of the line for a while . Nathan , don 't . Treason is such an ugly word . - Are you accusing me ? - Oh , I wouldn 't do that . Not without proof . Oh , my baby ! I didn 't realize I was going that fast . I didn 't see you . Is she all right ? Better call the doctor . What do you want me to do ? I 'm sorry . I didn 't see her . I swear . She pushed the baby carriage right in front of me . Let 's talk about it in the car . Wait . I work for Nathan Bates , Science Frontiers . I don 't care . Haven 't you heard about Nathan Bates ' new gun law ? It 's a capital offense just to carry one of these . Join us . - Wait a minute . You can 't do this . - Oh , yeah ? Watch me . Cover him , Willie . Jackpot . Come on , darling . I suggest you gentlemen move it . That 's the third arms shipment intercepted this month ... despite the new curfew . They seem to know our routes before we do ... Well , obviously there 's a leak , but who ? You know my thoughts on that , sir . Julie Parrish . - Do you have any proof ? - I will . As soon as you have anything , I wanna see it . I want to get to the bottom of this , once and for all . And then , Mr. Bates ? Let 's just say that won 't be Julie Parrish 's best day . Diana , Garrison is here . - Isn 't that the Book of Zon ? - Yes . Religious nonsense . A collection of myth and fairy tales . Let 's not bore Mr. Garrison . Thank you , Daniel . - I 've been thinking about our deal . - And ? A bar of gold for a ton of cobalt ... doesn 't exactly seem like a fair exchange . - What was it you had in mind ? - Five bars a ton . - We had an agreement . - Well , things ... - change in war . - Yes , people die . Yeah , that 'd be a pity . Especially since the mine is above the snowline ... and your people couldn 't get within 20 miles of that cobalt ... without choking on the red dust . Don 't press your luck . There are other mines besides your little excuse for one . Maybe . But my little excuse for a mine is already in your back pocket . You are gonna get your first delivery , Willow Point , tomorrow . I 'll hold you to it . It would be most uncomfortable for you and us ... if the delivery were late . Before you leave , I 'd like you to see something . In case you decide to renege on our deal . Kenneth , be reasonable . Where is Amon 's transmission coming from ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . The Book of Zon was found hidden in your quarters . The penalty for its possession is death . I could pardon you . Tell me , have you ever seen a crivit feed ? - A what ? - A crivit , Mr. Garrison . It 's like a shark . " Zon is the cause for which I would die . " Good day , Mr. Garrison . Robin , can we continue this discussion another time , please ? You 're not very understanding . If Elizabeth were upset , you 'd take the time to talk to her . - Come on , honey . You know that 's not so . - Yes , it is . Everybody thinks she 's so special . - You know , Robin , she is special . - Well , I 'm special , too . I 'm her mother . And I haven 't had it easy . I 've lost both my parents . - And I 'm tired ... - You 're tired ? Well , I 'm tired , too , Robin . I 'm tired of the Visitors . I 'm tired of Bates , and I 've had up to here with this war . And of looking over my shoulder every time I leave Science Frontiers ... because Chaing or somebody else is following me . - And I 'm tired of you . - What ? Yes , I 'm tired of a whimpering self-pitying child ... who continually puts her own needs in front of everybody else 's . There 's one road that leads through town directly to the mine . Where does he make the delivery to Diana ? - Just about here , below the frost line . - Makes sense to me . You 'll take Rawlinsville like Grant took Richmond . Almost seems too easy . When this is all over ... - maybe we could get together . - I 'd like that . But let 's see if we win , first . There 's a place I know about , where the hills meet the ocean . - We could watch the sun go down . - You move fast . Nobody has much time in this business . Come on . - I 'm coming with you . - No chance . I 've made up my mind . I won 't be left behind . You 're not going . Kyle , please don 't tell me whether I can go or not . I 'm tired of hiding and running ... while other people are putting their lives on the line for me . - I can 't let you . - If I have to , I 'll follow you . This is crazy . That 's what I 'm gonna become if I don 't start fighting back . Please . It 's my life . You better take jacket . It gets cold in those hills at night . Kyle , you like things that go bang . Yeah . This is our latest purchase from Science Frontiers . Separate , they don 't mean a thing . But together ... they make nitro look tame . - How close is the town ? - About three miles . - I 'll take point . - Okay . - You okay ? - I 'm fine . I tried to tell you this wasn 't such a good idea . I 'm here because I want to be . - What are you trying to prove ? - That I 'm not some freak . Some thing that you and the others have to protect . - What ? - I love you . If you 're gonna be risking your life for me , I want to be there . I might be able to help . Okay . Come on , let 's catch up to the others . So I came back to tell you I was sorry , and that 's when I saw him . He was looking for something . - And he got it . - Got what ? The copy of the computer disc that I took from Bates . - What are we gonna do ? - We gotta get out of here right away . We 've lost Amon 's signal . But the source of the transmission seems to be getting closer . All that can wait . For the moment . We don 't eat like this in the ensigns ' mess . Rank does have its privileges . Make yourself comfortable . I haven 't seen a table set like this since my family 's . But that was before the war . We must all make sacrifices . - To the Leader . - To us . - What are you doing here ? - It is so strange to you ? What are you doing here ? My husband died and didn 't leave me a penny . What are you doing here ? You 're hurting my arm . I suggest you 'd better leave , at once . If my Max were alive , you wouldn 't have done that . - Do you have proof ? - Yes , sir . Beyond a shadow of a doubt . - Did you pick her up ? - Yes , sir . - Send her in . - Yes , Mr. Bates . - What 's going on ? - It 's called treason . How dare you ? Sending your thug into my home . Violating my privacy . Who the hell do you think you are ? Julie , I 'm ... You 're what ? You 're sorry , Nathan ? It 's going to take a lot more than that . - Can 't we ... - No , we can 't . I 'll take what 's mine . They 're trucking them to the mine . - How many guards are left in town ? - That 's Marcus , over there . By the square , there will be two more . It gonna be tough to take him without any other guards noticing . We 'll need to create a diversion . Look , when Garrison puts him somewhere , he doesn 't move . Hi . - Where the hell did you come from ? - North Blatt . About five miles down the road . - I 'm bored . - I get off in a couple of hours . Take it from me , I know what men want . Get your friends . - Where did you learn that stuff ? - What stuff ? The " Take it from me , I know what men want , " stuff . Oh , television . Women . I told you I 'd be back . - What next ? - We take the mine . If Glenna 's right , we 'll find two men in front the mine ... - and one in front of the mine 's office . - And two in the woods . - What do you mean , " If Glenna is right ? " - Easy , Elias . Putting a lot of our trust in somebody you don 't know . Yeah , that 's the trouble with you , Ham . You 're cold . - You don 't trust anybody . - Keeps me alive . If you call that living ... Whenever you 're ready . - Don 't shoot me , I 'm on your side . - Lucky for us . Well , what are you doing here ? - You guys gonna fight Garrison ? - Maybe . - I 'm gonna help . - Get rid of him . Don 't worry , he can 't help it . He 's like that with everybody . - I gotta help . - What about your parents ? My father 's a doctor . But they 've got him working in the mine . - How about your mom ? - I don 't know . Don 't worry , we 'll have you with your dad real soon . Just like Glenna said . Two at the mine , one at the office . - Two in the woods . - I 'm glad Kyle 's watching our backs . I 'll handle the one at the office . You guys take care of our woodsy friends . All right . Come on , let 's pick it up . You guys are working too slow . You want to eat , you gotta do better than that . You keep on these guys . Hey , old man , what are you doing ? You don 't break till I say so . Come on , let 's work . Pick it up . Who in the hell are you ? The man who 's gonna make you wish you never asked that question . Hold it right there . You should 've sealed that back entrance like I told you . I should have killed you when I had the chance . You 're right . I know . You had to , right ? Let 's blow the mine and get out of here . There 's something else I have to do . Drop your weapons . Do it , or you 're dead . Now , you can join me , or you can join him . What is this ? Some kind of joke , right ? - Afraid not , baby . - Why ? So she can become Diana 's new supplier . Fool . Sounds like a deal . I 'm not greedy . I 'll take what you offered Garrison . Have the cobalt and the Resistance at Willow Point at 5 : 00 p.m. , sharp . We 'll be there . Just bring the gold and my bonus for delivering Donovan and the others . Inform land-based operations I 'll have the cobalt tonight . - We mount the offensive as planned . - Are you sure you can trust this Glenna ? - I thought your deal was with Garrison . - I deal with whoever holds the cards . - You 'll accompany me to the rendezvous . - Of course . - Send a hyperlight cable to our leader . - What should I say ? We 've destroyed the LA Resistance , and the Starchild is back in our protection . - You are a genius . - I know . Sometimes it don 't pay to be a hero . By 5 : 00 , we 'll be rich , and you 'll be dead . Set up . Ten years I 've been on the street , and in all my life ... nobody ever set me up like this . You think you got a monopoly on making mistakes ? - Are we clear ? - Yeah . What 's he doing ? The explosives you stole from my father 's truck . Smart pup . - What do I do with this ? - Cover her up . Put it over your face . Yo , you deadhead , Frank . Took you long enough . What do you want ? I was just trying to tell you something 's burning in here . It 's clean . They should be here by now . If all goes well , I may have to make you my personal adjutant . Thank you , Diana . This is my last clip . And that cobalt truck 's coming down the road any minute . Got ideas ? I was kind of hoping for the cavalry myself . - Cover me , Donovan . - What ? - What ? Are you crazy ? - Yeah , like a fox . - You can 't do it , Elias . - Try me . I 'm out of this game . I 'll do what I can . That was my last . - They must be out of ammo . - Let 's go get one , then . Hey , come on out . All right , where are you ? - Come on ! - We got you now ! No sweat . You 're certain ? I even radioed the ship for confirmation . Aerial reconnaissance reports ... that both the ore truck and mine have been destroyed . - The Resistance . Prepare to take off . - Why ? Someone has to pay for misinforming the Leader . Next time you play the Lone Ranger ... don 't forget to bring your bullet-proof vest . Next time ? You must be joking . - You are lucky to be alive . - I guess so . Thanks a lot , Doc . - Dad ! - Billy . No . Thank you . English

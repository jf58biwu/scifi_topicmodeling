 SAINT JOHN : She 's bottoming out on me . I 've lost all the electronics . ( CHOKING ) I 'm afraid your friend is dead . I 'm terribly sorry . God is with him . We 've got every kind of fire-power and computer in the world and nothing can bring him back . Freeze ! Completing sweep of the area . I 'm getting a reading . Going to visual . Saint John , she 's in trouble ! I 'm taking us down . I ... I saw ... He took my hand . This young man saved your life . Oh , thank you . Who are you ? Saint John Hawke . Are you all right ? Yes , yes , I 'll be fine . Thank you . What happened ? Uh , well , we were flying in the area . We were doing tests for tomorrow 's flight . And we saw you fall . Well , it 's a lucky thing we spotted you , huh ? ( CHUCKLING ) Yes . Thank you . Uh , we better get back on schedule . Right . Are you with Conklin Aerotech ? Uh , no , ma 'am . We 're just doing a job for them . Well , you can tell those noisy hyenas over the hill , can have a piece of my mind . We are trying to run a holy retreat here . And even God can 't hear us over the noise of those planes . Well , I 'll talk to them and see what they can do about their flight path . ( MUMBLES ) You know , Sandra , this isn 't meant to be a prison . If you want to go , all you have to do is say so . Yes , Reverend Mother . MAN ON PA : All personnel , clear the flight line . Whoo ! This baby 's got some horses . JO : With a development budget of over 300 million , oughta have more like a cavalry charge . Yeah , sure , but what kind of mileage does it get , huh ? Let 's find out . ( LOUD ROARING ) I told you , no pictures . Could I get a statement concerning the cost over-runs on the S-19 Viper , Mr. Conklin ? Just make up a quote , honey . You will anyway . ( SCOFFS ) ( INDISTINCT ) SAINT JOHN : Slight instrument flux on inversion . ( BEEPING ) See you on the flip side . ( ALARM BEEPING ) Red alert ! I 've got trouble ! She 's bottoming out on me . Get the hell out of that thing . The circuits are fried . I 'm going down . No way . We 'll laser it off . MAN ON PA : We have an emergency in progress . ( INAUDIBLE ) Roll emergency vehicles . I 'm focused in . Shoot . Get the hell out of there . MAN ON PA : Pilot ejected . Respond to north-west segment . Oh , he ought to be all right now . That was close . Too close for comfort . Now , look , if we 're going to maintain our cover we should get the hell out of here . Excuse me , uh , what went wrong up there ? A full statement will be released after a complete investigation . Let 's go , Jenkins . We got a lot to talk about . Of course , of course . Let 's go . Uh , Mr. Conklin , what was that helicopter doing up there , please ? ( WOMAN STUTTERING ) Goon ! I pulled that out of the cockpit before I ejected . What is it ? It 's the motherboard on half the electronics systems in that flying cracker box of yours , including the ejection seat ! Now , I want to know what the hell is going on here . I could assure you a full investigation ... Don 't give me that crap ! You 're not dealing with the press here ! Now , I almost got killed up there and I want to know why . So do I , but it 'll take time to trace it back ... I 've got all the time in the world . ( PANTING ) Now , you can start by calling up the schematics on the Viper . I 'm afraid that 's classified information , Major . Not with my clearance code , it isn 't . I don 't believe this . What ? ( SIGHING ) The plan for the Viper was solid as a rock , but in almost every instance , the materials used were below the standards called for . My God , why ? That 's what I intend to find out . How do I get out of here ? Here , take my car . I 'll have the motor pool run me home . Thanks , Jenkins . ( CHOKING ) ( BOTH GRUNTING ) I can understand how you feel , but I 'm afraid your friend is dead . What about identification ? There wasn 't a lot left after the fire . Hey , look , I can 't believe this . There is no way . There 's simply no other ... What ? It can 't be him . Not like this . Not Saint John . Did he have any enemies ? Sure , why not ? Look , what about dental records ? The Coroner 's people said they 'd do a comparison after they had all the info . I 'm terribly sorry . Yeah . Tell me what you heard . I want to hear it one more time . Look , I 've already been through this all night with the police . Indulge us . I told him he could use my car . When he came outside , I heard shots ... An explosion . By the time I got out here , the car was already on fire . There was nothing I could do . And you saw nothing at all ? JENKINS : It was dark . LOCKE : And you didn 't hear another car leaving ? There 's nothing I can tell you I haven 't already told them . All you have to do is read the police report . I 'll do that . You 'll be hearing from us , Jenkins . Good evening , Sister . ( LEAVES RUSTLING ) ( GASPS ) ( GRUNTS ) You bloody moron . What do you expect ? I 'm no killer . No kidding . Now , look , shut up , the both of you . Not only is the plane down , but the military are going over the Viper specs with a fine-tooth comb . Now , we crash a multi-million dollar aircraft and the test pilot walks away . Now , he 's the only one who can prove that crash wasn 't pilot error . And I want him dead . It wasn 't my fault Paulson didn 't kill him . And not your fault that you can 't shoot straight , either . I thought he was still in the car until after the fire died down . Did you search the woods ? I couldn 't find a trace . It was dark . Well , did you at least wing him ? I must have . He probably bled to death out in the bush by now . You 'd better hope so . Now , I want you to go through those woods with a fine-tooth comb . He didn 't just disappear . Now , if he 's alive , he 's probably going to get in touch with his friends . I 've got a man on the inside , but I don 't know how long he can stall them . Now , look , if that pilot even breathes , I want you on him . I can 't afford to have him alive . REVEREND MOTHER : You should have called me as soon as you found him . But he needed help , and I knew I could help him . I didn 't want to disturb you so late . Oh , I understand , child . You did what you thought best . You did the right thing . I think so , too . ( GRUNTING ) You shouldn 't get up just yet . What was it ? A car accident ? Yeah . Look , I got to call Locke , Jo ... I 'm sorry , we have no phone . You have to rest . You 're still in shock . ( SIGHING ) Anything ? Hard to say . It looks like he made a copy of the Viper 's plans , and then cross-referenced it against the materials manifest . It 's hard to tell what he found until the computer fills in the blanks . What do you mean , " Lost them " ? Well , find them ! What 's the problem ? They lost them ! They had his dental records there and they lost them . How ? I don 't know how ! ( SOBBING ) Hey , come on , now , Jo , we can 't just give up . We 've got every kind of fire-power and computer in the world and nothing can bring him back . Hey , we don 't know anything for sure yet , huh ? Besides , like Jason says , Saint John 's too smart to let anything like this call his number . That 's what I thought about Uncle Dom , too . It 's all right . You know , nobody just loses dental records , at a time like this . It 's all too convenient . What are you saying ? I mean , this whole thing smells cover-up . Somebody out there doesn 't want us to know that body was not Saint John . Then where is he ? Hi , there . Hello . How do you feel ? Like somebody turned me inside out . Did you do this ? Yes . Thanks . I 'm sorry to have been so much trouble , but this was the first safe haven I could find . Safe ? From what ? The less you know the better . I 've got to call my friends . Oh , you can 't go anywhere just yet . The closest phone is at the gas station at the bottom of the mountain . Let me call them . No , it 's too dangerous . Dangerous ? Jo ... ( PHONE RINGING ) ( RINGING CONTINUES ) JO ON ANSWERING MACHINE : Hello . Santini Air is closed right now . We 'll be open for business in the morning . Please leave your message at the sound of the beep , and we 'll get back to you . Have a good day . Goodbye . Um , uh , hello . This is ... ( SANDRA OVER RADIO ) Uh , never mind . I just want you to know that Saint John Hawke has been hurt , but he 's all right . He 'll be in touch with you as soon as he 's able . Come on ! Keep talking ! Please don 't worry . God is with him . He 'll be all right . I got it . Our flyboy 's in for a little company . That gas station , she made a call from is not far from Conklin Aerotech . So who 's the girl ? What am I , a fortuneteller ? SANDRA ON TAPE : God is with him . He 'll be all right . ( TAPE REWINDING ) Great , lady , but where is he ? Damn , I wish I 'd been there when she called . At least we know Saint John 's still alive . SANDRA ON TAPE : God is with him . " God is with him ? " You know , that sounds like the girl we pulled off the mountain . How would she have found him ? Maybe he found her . Did she say anything when she was in Airwolf ? Yeah , yeah , I think she did . Then it 'll be on the black box . MIKE : Right . We 'll see if the voices match . Let 's keep working on that disk . Right . I 'll make the transfer . Reverend Mother ? Sandra , good . You had a message from Charlie at the farm . Bonnie 's started her contractions . How does it feel to be back among the living ? Oh , well , a little worse for wear , but mostly grateful . Thank you very much . You 're most welcome . But your guardian angel here deserves all the credit . Yes , I was , uh ... I was very lucky . But , right now , I 'd like to call my friends . Is there any chance of catching a ride down to that phone ? Um , the caretaker has the van right now . But Sandra could point you on your way . On her way to the farm , if you 're up to the walk ? It 's not very far , would you mind a short detour ? No . No , no , I suppose not . Well , I better find you something warm to wear . God be with you . Three brothers and two sisters ? That 's a houseful . Oh , you get used to it . I guess you 'd have to . Do you have any family ? A brother . He 's always looking out for me in his own way . Brother 's do that best . You did a professional job of patching me up . Are you a nurse ? Pre-med . You 're going to be a doctor ? Was . Until my father stepped in . Oh , it 's great to be one with nature . Of course , pretty soon , we 're going to be three with nature , ( EXHALES ) Right old lady ? ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Easy for you , Charlie . Charlie , if you 'll excuse us , Bonnie and I are going to see how little Sunflower is coming along . Gotcha , Sandy . What if the girl who made the call 's not there ? How are we going to find out where she is ? Just ... Just relax . Let me figure it out , all right ? ( GROANING ) How 's she doin ' ? Could be any time . We 're going to name her Sunflower , if it 's a girl , and if it 's a boy , we 're going to name him Goldenrod . That 's , uh ... It 's original . Yes , yes , I know , but the town 's too far . My friend 's fingers are all busted . He 's in a lot of pain . You 're damn right ! Well , there is the Saint Mathews retreat . They 've got a girl up there who runs a clinic for the locals . Thank you . Thanks very much . ( ENGINE STARTING ) All right , here we go . SANDRA : God is with him . And now , the recording from inside Airwolf . God is with him . A perfect match . We 've got it . ( SIGHING ) But if he 's there , why hasn 't he called ? Maybe he can 't , Jo . Look , why don 't you keep working on reconstructing the info on that disk , while Mike and I check out the mission . All right . But call if you find him . SANDRA : God is with him . So now you 're going to kill a bunch of nuns ? Is that your big plan ? ( CHUCKLING ) Shut up , will you ! Just shut up . Oh , the world came to an end right after Kent State , you know ? I mean , you know , after that , what 's the point ? Right on , man . Good news and bad news , Charlie . Bonnie 's doing fine , but the baby seems to be in a bad position . Now , I think you should get her down to see Doc Roberts as soon as possible , before her water breaks . ( CLICKING TONGUE ) No , can do . Little Sunflower or Goldenrod is going to be born right here in our home . But there could be complications . Don 't you think her life and the baby 's are more important ? ( SIGHING ) Then I 'll ride down and bring the Doc back up here . He said he 'd do it when the time came . I 'll go with you . Uh , sorry , my horse only rides one . Horse ? I 'm going to need all the help I can get . I really should get word to my friends where I am . Oh , they already know . How ? I found a business card that said " Jo Santini . " Since you mentioned Jo , I thought it would be all right . I told you how dangerous that could be ! ( SIGHING ) What 'd she say ? I left a recorded message . I didn 't say where you were , just that you were all right . Hey , man , I 've got to split . All right , Charlie , why don 't you go ahead . We 'll stay with Bonnie . Back in a flash . Far out . I was only trying to help . I know . ( BELL TOLLING ) I 'm not really very good at this , you know ? Sandra 's the doctor in the house . She 's studied medicine , you know . For the most part , I just help out every now and then . Sorry . Where is she ? I don 't truly know . Oh ! My goodness ! Is that a gun ? ( GASPS ) Yarmy , don 't ! Hey , Sister , I want you to tell me where Sandra is . ( GUN COCKING ) Or I 'll kill you . Understand what I 'm telling you ? It 's not too far now . How 's it coming , Jo ? Well , the pieces are starting to come together . The requisition manifests don 't match the Viper specs . So if the money didn 't go into the jet , then it went into somebody 's pocket and I 'd like to know whose . ( SISTER MARIE GASPING ) What is the meaning of this ? Please ... This is about that injured man , isn 't it ? The pilot ? Yes , it is ... My Reverend Mother . Where is he ? He left here hours ago . You 're lying . I 'm going to look around . If they move , shoot them . Right . ( DOOR CLOSING ) SANDRA : But , why didn 't you tell me all of that before ? SAINT JOHN : Well , I guess I could have , but at the time , I was trying to keep you out of it . I understand . I didn 't exactly inspire confidence when you found me hanging on a cliff . What were you doing way up there ? Running away , I suppose . From what ? Saint Mathews . From the memory of those poor people I left in Africa . But you were helping them , right ? Yes , I was helping them . But it wasn 't enough . It was never enough . I wanted to be a doctor to them . Not just pat them on the back and tell them it would get better . That God would look out for them . Well , I 'm sure you did all you could . You bet I did . I ran as fast and as far as I could . I couldn 't see how God could allow that kind of suffering to go on . Well , I 'm no theologian , but the way I see it , man is in charge of those details . No , it 's not as simple as all that . Look , anybody would run from those horrors . Yes , but I was there to help . And now I 'm here . And running away again ? ( SIGHING ) Look , Sandra , the toughest thing in the world is to make that decision , to take that first step . You don 't have to give up your religion to become a doctor . And what do I have to give up to be a woman ? Not a thing . It 's all there . You just have to accept who you are . I think you 'd make one hell of a doctor . BONNIE : ( CRYING ) Sandra ! Sandra ! You know , Mr ... What did you say your name was ? I didn 't . Smith . Ah ! Mr. Smith , it is never too late to stop doing wrong . You don 't look like a man who enjoys his work . Are you a happy man , Mr. Smith ? That 's none of your business . Perhaps . But it is God 's . Are you going to shoot us ? Oh , I don 't think Mr. Smith would like that on his conscience . Would you , Mr. Smith ? ( DOOR OPENING ) He 's not here . I couldn 't find them . Well , I told you that already . Yarmy ! I 'm going to make a call . If the girl and the sky-boy shows up , keep them here with them . Oh , but ... Shut up ! This is it , Bonnie ! You can do it ! I can 't ! I have to wait for Charlie ! Right , we have to wait for Charlie . We can wait , but the baby won 't . She 's going to have the baby ? Here ? Now ? That would be my guess . What do I do ? Just exactly what you 're doing . Are you sure ? Conklin ? ( SCOFFS ) He 's up to his knees in it . That kind of corruption can only start at the top . Looks like he used inferior materials and pocketed the difference . He already had his piece of the pie . Didn 't care if the project was dead , so long as the pilot was . Have you called the company yet ? Yeah , head office is moving in on him now . Nice work , Jo . Thanks . Now all we need to do is find Saint John . ( BABY WHIMPERING ) Oh , oh , oh , oh , oh . ( CRYING ) Oh , no . He is a beauty . There you go . There 's Mommy . Shh , shh . Say , hello , Goldenrod . Nuns ? We almost have him , sir . It 's just a matter of time . Look , time is what we 're gonna be doing if you don 't nail him and nail him now ! No . The next time I hear from you , he 'd better be dead ! ( LAUGHS ) Could I help you , gentlemen ? ( CHUCKLES ) ( SIGHING ) How 'd your friend make out with his hand ? He 's fine , just fine . Oh , well , if he still needs that girl from Saint Mathews , I hear she 's over at the Campbell place . Uh ... How do I find it ? I think that your friend has left you holding the bag as they say . Be quiet . Mother Superior is right . He should be back by now . He 's probably been arrested . Why don 't you put down your gun and give yourself up before someone gets hurt ? ( LAUGHS ) Sure . It 's too late for that now . Oh , it 's never too late . ( GROANS ) Quick , Sister ! Grab the gun ! Grab the gun ! Freeze ! ( BABY CRYING ) Damn ! ( SHUSHING ) ( MOUTHING ) SANDRA : Saint John ... Shh ! They 've found me . Try and keep the baby quiet . I 'll lead him away . What ? Who found you ? ( CRYING STOPS ) Was that a gun ? ( GUNSHOTS ) ( BOTH GRUNTING ) You 're pretty tough with nuns , try this on for size . MIKE : Do you want to read it ? No , no , you 've been practicing , you read it . Okay , uh , " Jerry Conklin and the entire senior staff of Conklin Aerotech " have been indicted on several charges . " Well , those fat-cats will spend more time in court , than they will in jail . Yeah . Thanks , Jo . Yeah . Money can 't buy justice , but it can buy lawyers . Ah , people like that always pay , sooner or later . You got a point . Hello . Sandra ! Saint John . Here . Oh , thank you . I was on my way to my plane . I just wanted to say goodbye . So , what 's up , Doc ? Oh , don 't rush it . I haven 't even qualified for my residency yet . You will . Well , if I do , it 's because you 've given me the confidence to see it through . No , it was always there . You just never looked deep enough . ( SIGHING ) And about that other stuff ... Goodbye . Goodbye . ( INAUDIBLE )

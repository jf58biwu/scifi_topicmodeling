 Those Russians really know how to put on a show , don 't they ? You mean the Russians got to the moon ? What happened to the Americans ? I intend to have Dr. Von Braun and his colleagues in my custody . Somehow I 'm gonna see that you make it to the Americans . They must be taken alive . Stay with them . BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! ( PLUMMETING ) ( BOTH GROANING ) Cape Kennedy , the first U.S. Moon shot . Oh , you blew it . ( OMNI BEEPING ) Red light . Maybe that was the wrong date or place or something . No way . Bogg , this place looks like a junkyard . Oh , hey , look . We must be kind of close , huh ? Aerospace museum ? That 's an aerospace museum ? Doesn 't look like much of a gas station either , huh ? Red light , huh ? Some birthday present . Huh ! Come on . " Anywhere you wanna go . " That 's what you said . Hello ? Is anybody here ? No , there 's nobody here . Gas just pumps itself . Hi . What can I do for you , pilgrims ? This is Cape Kennedy , isn 't it ? Canaveral . Cape Canaveral . You guys miss the ship or something ? Oh . No ... But we did hear about the museum . Pretty hard to go anywhere without people talking about Wally 's museum . Absolutely famous . You hungry ? You look hungry . I got moon dogs , rocket burgers , orbit colas . Right up here at the snack stand . Absolutely famous , hardly need to advertise . Well , the gas business , now that 's another story . Been kinda slow ever since the government moved out . Moved out ? What about the moon shot ? Hey ! Wasn 't that something ? Those Russians really know how to put on a show , don 't they ? Of course , you couldn 't understand a darned thing they were saying . You mean the Russians got to the moon ? Yeah , about two years ago . Now for just about 50 cents I 've got a picture , color of course , some genuine Russian stamps , and that isn 't all ... Wally ... Yes , sir . We were kind of interested in the American space program . Well , sure . I guess we 're all a little patriotic , but the Russian stuff , that 's the best part of the tour . What happened ? What happened to the Americans ? Kinda missed the boat , I 'm sorry to say . A little like your friend here . You know the real rocket minds were the German V2 scientists in World War II . We were supposed to get them over here . You mean like Wernher Von Braun ? Yeah . Oh , thanks . I was on my way to get this . Moon dog . Listen , it 's all in the museum , guys . Better than I can tell it . Yeah , well , we 're kind of in a hurry , Wally . Do you think you can just tell us what happened ? Where 'd they go ? Well , the way the story goes , they were all hiding out in the Austrian Alps and one of their own scientists handed them over to some Nazi general . And he handed them over to the Russians . That 's how they got to the moon . You wouldn 't happen to know the date , would you ? Not happen to , friend ? I have a picture of those guys the day the Russians got them . May 2nd , ' 45 . It 's a real big seller . It 's only $ 2.50 . Of course that 's in black and white . ( OMNI BEEPING ) Now if you want the frame , it 's only five bucks more . Are you gents interested in getting on the mailing list ? Now that is really the way to go . I do a mailing , oh , well , I 'd say , just a couple of times a year . Fellas ? Fellas ? ( BEEPING ) We 're right near Reutte , Austria . I set it for May 1 , just in case . Well , how are we going to find Von Braun ? Up here . No ! Turn around the other way . Keep moving . Whatever you do , do not stop ! You will attract their attention . OFFICER : Halt ! Von Braun and the scientists are here . My information is unquestionable . I tried . I 'm sorry . I cannot waste any more time . The scientists are here somewhere in this village . It will not go well for any of you if I do not find them . Got any extras ? You have no papers ? Not exactly . We were just ... Shh . There is very little time . The Russians are advancing from the east . The Americans approach from the south . And you think they will be kind ? ( KAMMLER SCOFFS ) I doubt it . I intend to have Dr. Von Braun and his colleagues in my custody . And believe me , it will help all of our causes . Herr General . Yeah ? ( EXCLAIMS ) So ... Enough ! KAMMLER : You 're all at liberty for the moment . JEFFREY : That was close . You are either brave men or complete fools . Where are your papers ? It 's a long story . And I hope a good one . Kammler is not finished yet . Yeah , well , Von Braun is in big trouble . We 're looking for him , too . Who are you working for ? We 're here with the ... You ! You are an American ? Well , are you ? Well ... You are . Come . We 're just ... Americans ! Thank heaven . You were sent here to reach Wernher Von Braun ? Do you know where he is ? If you only knew how long and hard we have looked for you . Now wait a minute . I 'm not sure you understand that ... Understand ? Of course I understand . Quickly , come with me . He 's right here in the village , Klaus , as we thought . The informant ? Yeah . Now , I want a full squad , but strict orders , Klaus . They must be taken alive . Alive ? But the orders ? Oh , yes , to liquidate them , to bury their knowledge of our rockets . But the Russians want that knowledge . A deal with them may keep us out of a prison camp in Siberia . And we know all about camps , don 't we , Klaus ? Now hurry . We can always kill them later if we have to . Come . Bogg , you don 't think he could be the traitor ? I don 't know . ( EXPLOSIONS ) ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) They 're all right . How are things here ? I 'm glad you 're here . Wernher 's still disheartened . You wait here . The Wehrmacht is caught between the Allies and the Russians . Fighting is fierce . Wernher , Kammler is desperate . We must get out of here . I know , I know . But haven 't I done everything I can , and still we cannot lose him . Maybe somebody else should try . We are saved . I have made contact with the Americans . Where are they ? Wait . You will not believe it . Could it be true ? Wait . Wait , Otto . OTTO : Wernher , you were right . We will see . No . All this time you were right . Wait , Otto ! You see ? A boy ? The Americans have sent a child to rescue us ? Willie , please . Let them speak . Are you Dr. Von Braun ? You see ? American ! I 'm sorry , but I think your friend 's made a little mistake . Mistake ? I have made no mistake . You said you were Americans . That 's not exactly what I said . As I suspected , Ernst . You have led Herr General Kammler directly to us all . You lied . You said you were here for Dr. Von Braun . I am here for all of you . Believe me , we 're not with Kammler . We 're not with anybody . We 're just ... We 're here to warn you . To warn us ? About what ? What more could you warn us about ? I have some sensitive information . Get them out of here . No , Wernher , don 't let them go . We must listen . Please ... Wernher , we are wasting precious time . Doctor , I need to speak with you alone , please . The only ... No ! It is not with me you need to speak . None of you ! I cannot make any more decisions . I am the one who made the mistakes . What ? Wernher , what are you talking about ? I am not your leader . I have tried and I have failed . Wernher , no ! You cannot give up now . But look what I 've gotten you all into . My plans , my ideas , my bungling ... Enough ! We cannot take a chance on Kammler 's finding us . We must surrender to the Russians . No . Here , Otto . Take this radio crystal . And broadcast on our special frequency . And tell the others whatever you wish . No ! Please , Dr. Von Braun , you 've got to listen . Just wait . Before you bring all the scientists together , you have to ... ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Von Braun ! Von Braun ! ( KNOCKING CONTINUES ) KAMMLER : It would be simpler and safer to surrender . It 's Kammler . But how did he find us ? We 're trying to make you listen . One of your people is a traitor . OTTO : No ! VON BRAUN : Impossible . KAMMLER : Give yourselves up and no one will be hurt . KAMMLER : Von Braun ! Ernst . ERNST : Yeah ! ( ALL CHATTERING IN GERMAN ) Leave it . There is no time ! Here . The crystal . Don 't forget the crystal ! ( BANGING ON DOOR ) Burn the rest . ( BANGING CONTINUES ) Stay with them . Go on . What are you waiting for ? You don 't give me orders . Move ! Tear gas . It 's the only one we have left . Use it well . Come on ! ( OFFICERS SHOUTING ) ( COUGHING ) ERNST : Go ! ( OFFICERS SHOUTING IN GERMAN ) Schnell , in here . Do it ! Down that way ! Head them off ! They 've escaped ! Where are they ? Quick , quick ! Move ! BOGG : Where are we going ? OTTO : Into the mountains . We have a camp . JEFFREY : How far are we ? OTTO : About five miles from the village . I 'm afraid we must face the fact that there is an informer among us . It does not even matter who it is ! If Kammler was able to find us in the village , he might know by now even where the campsites are . I don 't think so . He would have been here by now . Still , we must prepare to leave immediately . Wernher , please tell them we cannot stay here any longer . ERIKA : But , Otto , where should we go ? To meet the Russians . I 'm sure the Americans will be here soon . The guns get closer every day . Yes , from both directions . What about the traitor ? Are we to ignore Herr Bogg 's warnings even now ? ( ALL CLAMORING ) Stop it all of you ! Wernher , please , tell us . What are we to do ? No , Erika , I will not . Dr. Von Braun , the Americans are looking for you . I 'm sure of it . Herr Bogg , everyone looks for us . And everyone looks to me to deliver them to safety . I couldn 't even get myself out of Peenem√ºnde safely . I broke my arm when my car went off the road . Now the war is almost over . And I will have to let my friends decide for themselves . But Wernher ... ( ERIKA AND VON BRAUN CHATTERING ) We have come this far together . Please , this one last time , let me try to find the Americans . This is foolishness . We have no time for any more of your bicycle rides . No . I think we should let him go . Just for a few hours . Otto , it 's ... Bogg , let me go with him . No . Please . A man and a boy . No one would suspect us . That is fine with me . I will get warmer clothes for both of you . He will be safe with Ernst . Perhaps much safer than he would be here . Please . ( SIGHS ) All right . People are leaving the villages . End of a war , many will be homeless . Are you sure we 're going the right way ? Have we passed any of the German army ? Sure . Then we 're going the right way . Ernst . He 's my age . Yeah . And old men , too . When all else is lost , we always seem to find more to lose . Come . Mr. Bogg . Dr. Schumann . I have something to tell you . Yes ? Back in the village . The cellar . I couldn 't move . I was frozen . I should have thanked you sooner . Forget it . Well , I am most grateful . Maybe you 'd better save your thanks till you 're really safe . What is safe anymore ? We used to have respect . We used to have a life . Now what are we ? Just something to buy , sell , throw away . That 's not what people are for . Erika . I need your help . I doubt that . I am little good to anyone at this time . Try , please . Think back . This afternoon , did anyone leave the basement ? I know Ernst left . But anyone else ? I know of no traitors , Mr. Bogg . Erika , please . I wasn 't asking you to ... General Kammler has other means at his disposal . Yes , I 'm sure he does . That 's ... Do not ask me to raise your suspicions about anyone . ( EXPLOSIONS ) ( GUNS FIRING ) Quickly , off the road ! ( EXCLAIMS ) This way . Here . This trail leads south . Let us hide the bicycles . We 'll leave them here . We must be close . Ja , we are close . But to which side ? How do you know the Americans are south ? We have received reports . Americans south . Russians east . ( MUTTERING IN GERMAN ) Excuse me , Dr. Von Braun . Your people need you . They 've come to depend on you . And in just a little while they 're gonna need you more than ever . Yes . Yes . You 've encouraged that . I was wrong . Too late . You are a stranger . What do you know of us ? Enough . Tell me about Kurt . He is a young man who cares very much about saving us . Where did you find him ? In the village . Not at the rocket center ? Forget it . Bitte forget Kurt , ja ? Who then , Doctor ? Does it matter ? Yes , it matters . Somehow I 'm going to see that you make it to the Americans , but I can 't do that if one of your own people is sabotaging us every step of the way . Herr Bogg . Yes ? Our own people , as you put it . Even Kammler , General Kammler , is one of our own people . SOLDIER : Halt . ( SOLDIER SPEAKING GERMAN ) We 're civilians . We 've lost our way . You say nothing . Let me talk . SOLDIER : Hey , you guys sprechen Sie English ? Seen any Kraut soldiers ? Jeffrey Jones , New York , New York . I 've heard it all now . Fred Schneiker , Sheboygan , Wisconsin . All right ! ERNST : The Americans are sorry , but they cannot come for us . It was a small patrol and there are too many Nazis in the village . We must make it through on our own to meet them . We finally find the Americans and this is how we decide ? Where are the others ? They are packing up as fast as they can , Otto . That is their answer . They want the Americans . The wonderful Americans . You think they will take all of us , the families ? Move all of them to the United States ? With the Russians , even if we cannot go home , our families will be close . Ernst , what did they tell you ? Oh , they are most anxious to receive Germany 's scientists . They will do everything they can . How many ? Numbers were not discussed . You see ? OTTO : No . No , I don 't see . Now , right now , they fight Germany . But they are nothing alike . Look at the way they are , their life , their politics . Tell us about America , Otto . When were you there ? Well , it 's true I have not been there , but I have heard . They 'll put us in a camp . We 'll be no better off than we are now . No . That 's not true . It 's my country and it 's a wonderful place . He 's just a boy . It is his home . He does not know any better . I 've traveled . Boy , have I traveled . Look , it 's not the only place to live , but it stands for what you 're looking for . It means being able to do what you want , being able to go where you want . Go on . You 're doing fine . And if you want to build rockets , to go into space , well , nobody but nobody can beat us . Why do you think we 're winning this war ? ( ALL CHATTERING IN GERMAN ) Think I overdid it ? You got my vote , Senator . For the Americans , a show of hands . Good . Pay no attention , Klaus . They despise us . It 's as meaningless as their bands and flowers that welcomed us years ago . Do you think we will get the information in time ? Oh , yeah . Our friend does not dare cross us . Von Braun will come out of his hole soon now and we 'll have them . Look , if we are to surrender , we do it on our own terms . You have to find a radio somewhere . The other scientists who are waiting in the area must be alerted . You can plug this crystal into any radio transmitter . Then you will be able to reach our people . There is great risk , Herr Bogg . It 's all right . I 'm going along with you . She is right . A woman is less threatening to them . And Kurt knows the area . But you ... I want to go . Besides , I couldn 't let the kid have all the glory . Here is the radio crystal . Thank you . Tell them to meet us just north of the town before sundown . Then we will make our way to the south . To the Americans . But won 't Kammler be able to hear you ? No , we have our own frequency . One that cannot be overheard . Kammler must not know . If he had any idea that we have to move through the village in order to reach them , we 're finished . Don 't worry . I 'll get the message out . Kurt . Ready . I 'm ... I am sorry we cannot spare a truck for just the three of you . Why do you have to go ? Someone has to keep an eye on Kurt . You really think it 's him ? He 's not a scientist and he 's the only one that didn 't come with them from Germany . We can 't take a chance . You heard Otto . Kammler can 't find out . Bogg ! Be careful . Sure . Voyager 's honor . Looks like it 's about to rain again . Perhaps I should go find some cover . Wait here , I 'll be right back . I guess it 's hard to think about leaving your country and starting all over again , huh ? It is . Well , this may not make very much sense right now , but believe me , if you and the others can get to the Americans , everything 's going to be all right . You 'll have a decent life . As the Americans like to say , home sweet home . I know it won 't be like your home . Doesn 't matter . There 's nothing left of my city . And your family ? Dead . They 're all dead . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to bring up any unpleasant memories . It 's not your fault . I have had no pleasant ones for a long time . But you 're a very intelligent woman , still young , beautiful . Silly of me not to count my blessings . I 've found a radio . Hi there . ( CHUCKLES ) Say , I was wondering if you could help me out . Would you know the best way to break a Nazi 's finger ? Easy . You punch him in the nose ! Here , take them . I hope Bogg makes it to your room . He will . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) BOGG : It 's me . Oh , good . I finally lost him . The radio , it 's almost ready . I 'll alert the groups on the special band . Are we sure no one saw you come in here ? No . No one . Dr. Schumann calling all Peenem√ºnde groups . Dr. Schumann calling all Peenem√ºnde groups . Urgent message . Our village location has been discovered . KURT : Knife . We are now operating from an emergency location . We have made contact with the Americans . All groups must move immediately . Groups at Oberjoch und Bramberg , I repeat , all groups must move today for rendezvous with American army . Find any means of transportation and meet us just north of the village . We will join the Americans down the south road . File . This may be our only chance . It is essential that you move quickly and quietly . We 've been had , Kurt . What ? She 's telling the Germans . She 's the traitor . The rendezvous point will be approximately ... Kammler ? Yes , but you don 't understand . Wernher trusted you even more than the others . I can explain . How could anyone explain what you 've done ? You cannot possibly think I would do such a thing out of choice . I have learned to hate the Nazis . Their cause is despicable . Their war is despicable . KURT : Then why ? They forced me . No one 's forcing you . We 're alone here , Erika . Just you , me and Kurt . Would you have me sacrifice my family ? You said your family was dead . No . My brother , Edward . Kammler had him arrested in Hamburg . Now he is a prisoner here at the village . To force me . Don 't you see ? I am sorry . I am terribly ashamed . That 's not going to help us now . And if they had someone you loved , what would you do Kurt ? Here . Reach the scientists . Tell them to abandon their villages now . Give them the instructions . How will they get through ? Kammler will be waiting ! I don 't know . Well ... Something , anything , a diversion . With what ? How ? They have nothing . Von Braun and the scientists . They have to have some weapons . They are brilliant , but they are not soldiers . The truck in the camp . What was in it ? The one with the danger signs on it . It 's from the rocket center at Peenem√ºnde . With the explosives ? No . Mostly records , our research . And some of our prototypes . With warheads ? No . Chemicals . Chemicals ? What for ? For the fuel . We add chemicals to track the trajectory . Smoke . You can make smoke . Yes , but I don 't see how ... Get the groups moving . Dr. Von Braun doesn 't have a radio . I must speak to him as soon as he reaches one . This can work . It has to . Calling all Peenem√ºnde groups . Calling all Peenem√ºnde groups . Klaus ? Nothing , General . All their hideouts are like Oberjoch . Deserted . So the Schumann woman has obviously changed sides again . ( SCOFFS ) She will regret it when I allow her to watch her brother 's execution . What about the village ? As you ordered . No one is allowed on the street . They will never reach the south road . Order all units back here immediately . There is more news , Herr General . A last transmission . Hitler is dead . Berlin is finished . Well , this is our last chance . If I don 't get those scientists , nobody will . Kammler 's reinforcements are less than two hours away . Not much time left , Bogg . BOGG : I see Kammler 's headquarters . It used to be our mayor 's office . It will be again . Is that where they 're holding your brother ? I think so . All right . Let me use the radio . This is Bogg calling Dr. Von Braun . This is Bogg calling Dr. Von Braun . Over . This is Ernst , Herr Bogg . We read you . What has happened ? What shall we do ? I need Von Braun . Yes , of course . Yes , Bogg . You 've heard about Kammler ? That he discovered the other locations , yes . And now he 's waiting for you . His reinforcements are on the way . There is no Kammler between us and the Russians . What are we waiting for ? Calm it down , please , meine Herren . I can 't promise you anything , but there 's still a good chance you can get through . What are you talking about ? I have a plan . But we 'll have to work fast . And I 'll need your help , Doctor . We 're going to make the Nazis think the Americans are attacking the village . You won 't let go of me , will you ? You 're the man . You 've always been the man . Your people know it . You know it , too . Yes , I know it , too . What ? I can 't hear you . All right , tell me your plan . I am ready . We are all ready . ( ALL CHEERING ) Bogg , you okay ? You bet . I 'll see you in town , Senator . Better give me Von Braun back . You are not a bad leader yourself , Herr Bogg . ( SOLDIER ORDERING IN GERMAN ) KLAUS : The scientists will never get through the town . Good . ( STATIC BUZZING ) Careful , meine Herren , careful . Otto . Yeah ? Ready to fire at your command , Wernher . That way , everybody . Keep the rear of the launchers clear . VON BRAUN : Otto . Yeah ? Our young friend here deserves the honor . Yeah . Good . Pull that and that . Okay ? It 's the Americans . The Americans are attacking in force ! ( ALL CLAMORING ) Thousands of them ! I can see thousands of them ! Run ! ( SOLDIERS SHOUTING IN GERMAN ) Come back . Come back , you fools . Herr General , it is over . We must save ourselves . It 's the Americans . I can see tanks now . They 're almost here . Bogg , it 's working ! They 're running away . Bogg ? Bogg ? It 's Bogg . He 's out there . Bring the trucks now . Hurry ! Herr General , we cannot wait any longer . It is over . Go ! I sure hope you 're Edward Schumann . Are you with the Americans ? Are they really here ? Well , at least one of them . I 'm kind of honorary . ( HORNS HONKING ) ( ALL CHEERING ) Bogg , you did it ! You did it ! We did it . Just like always . We owe you so much , Phineas Bogg . And I ... I owe you a great personal debt . Thank you . Well , Jeffrey , auf Wiedersehen . See you . Now everyone on the trucks . ( ALL CHEERING ) We must not keep the Americans waiting . ( TRUCK ENGINE STARTING ) ( DINGS ) Bogg . Thank you . Bogg . The moon shot , then back to work . I know , I know . Perhaps later ? We can pretend we 're meeting for the first time . ( TRUCK HORN HONKS ) Go tend to Edward . I 'll catch up to you . Okay . You know , Bogg , I guess we could stay for a while . Make up some kinda story . No . That just makes it worse . Well , then , this time I 'm sorry , really sorry . Me , too . Here . Get us out of here . Cape Canaveral ? Should be Cape Kennedy by now . ANNOUNCER ... Astronauts report it feels good . T minus 25 seconds . 20 seconds and counting . T minus 15 seconds . Come on . Twelve , eleven , ten , nine . This is it ! This is the real thing ! Ignition sequence start . Five , four , three , two , one , zero . All engines running . ( ALL CHEERING ) Liftoff . Ready to go back to work ? What , are you kidding ? In three days ... ARMSTRONG ... I 'm gonna step off the LM now . That 's one small step for man , one giant leap for mankind . Bogg . No matter how long I live , you 'll never be able to top this present . Don 't sell me short . I get around , you know . We get around . Like I said . You know , Bogg , it 'd be really easy to see her now . See who ? Erika . I mean , the scientists made it . She 's probably around here somewhere . She 's too old for me now , anyway . Hey , you shouldn 't try to kid a kidder . Okay . I don 't know . I guess there 's a price to pay for everything , huh ? Even being a voyager . Bogg . Yeah ? When 's your birthday ? Come on . JEFFREY ... If you want to learn more about the history of rockets , Wernher Von Braun or the Apollo 11 moonwalk , take a voyage down to your public library . It 's all in books !

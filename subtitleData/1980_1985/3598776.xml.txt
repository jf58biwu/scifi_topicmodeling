 T 's okay . That 's a gir . Come on . Robin . You shoudn 't be up yet . Your dad said you iked " Eizabeth . " I like that name . Elizabeth ? Is that the other one ? - Robin , you should be resting ... - I wanna see it . Oh , God . Oh , God ! ' Take you back to your room . That thing 's my baby ! - Where are we ? - Where we get off . Great . In what ? In these . Are you joking ? We 're gonna skydive out of here ? That 's right . T 's our ony chance . - You know how high we are ? - Actually , I do . - There 's no other choice . - I got a better idea . - Let 's get a fighter and cruise home . - Get back here . Put that thing on . I want the ship cordoned off , searched section by section . I want Donovan and that traitor found ! Is that the sound of panic in your voice ? The situation is under control . Under control , you say ? A trusted lieutenant betrayed you escaped with Donovan and things are " under contro " ? They ' be captured and dealt with appropriately . I hope so . Otherwise , ' be forced to strip you of your command . - Is that clear ? - Quite clear . Must I draw a picture ? Carry out my orders . Very well . Don 't understand why you 're making such a fuss . - Young cadets do this their first week . - All right . What do I do ? Just lower yourself over the edge . - The force of air will do the rest . - When we land ... If we land you ' come and join us . - No , my network has spread to Earth . I can do more good down there . Now go . - Cadets really do this ? - No . Sounded good , though , didn 't it ? - Like human skin . - T 's strange . We do not shed our skin until we have six years . Ony a week od , and she 's the size of a 2-year-old . - T 's not norma . - She all right ? - As far as can te , she 's fine . - Julie , Willie , you better come quick . He 's getting worse . Don 't know what to do . 'Ve tried everything . I too have done all that I know how . I have the fear he is dying . Willie , please , can 't you do something ? I am sorry . T 's the first time she 's ever cried . Julie . Hey , Julie , come here . Take a look at this . - A bood sampe from the baby 's corpse . - T 's teeming with bacteria . And this one is the bacterium from Wiie 's G tract . And ... that one . This is E. Coli , it 's found in every one of us . - The baby 's a hybrid of the two . - Right . I bet this hybrid is the bacterium that killed him . - You thinking what ' m thinking ? - Julie , this is it . This is the breakthrough , a bacterium they have no defense against . Elizabeth . - Oh , my God ! - Katie ! - Her face , it 's a swoen . - She spat venom on her . CPR . One one-thousand , two one-thousand , three one-thousand , four five one-thousand , six one-thousand , seven one-thousand eight one-thousand , nine one-thousand , 10 one-thousand . Come on , Katie . One one-thousand , two one-thousand ... She 's coming around . Harmony , get the oxygen . Katie . - Okay , honey . - Katie ? - Someone should kill that monster . - Easy . She 's your granddaughter . T 's good of you to take time out for us from your schedule , John . I think this is very important to you . It pains me to say this , because ' m genuiney fond of Diana ... But after the Donovan fiasco can 't keep sient . She 's become a iabiity . ' Reieve you now . - ' M on duty unti ... - You 're dismissed . She is my most valued aide . And she 's done wonders in the scientific field . But her running of this operation is a disaster . - Aren ' t you being harsh ? - She trusted Kristine . She allowed Julie and Donovan to escape . And worst of all , she exposed you to public humiliation in the center . - That was your responsibility . - Can 't do my job with an amateur interfering with every decision . - ' M sick of bickering . - I agree . We must focus on the rebels . This operation has become a nightmare . One that will soon be over . - ' Ve panted a spy in the resistance . - And I will coordinate the offensive . - We will rid you of this nuisance . - And Diana ? / ' ve ordered her to stick to scientific activities where / ' m sure her record will continue to be superb . Very well . All / can say is I had better see results . And soon . - Of course . - Wanna help me in the lab ? - Sure . Julie ! Sean ! Knew you 'd come back . Come here . You look taller . - Are you okay ? Did they hurt you ? - No , you ? Yeah , they kept me from you . - I know what you wanna do . - What ? - Play baseball with me . - Don 't ike baseba . - Since when ? You love baseball . - No don 't . Think it stinks . T 's aways been your favorite . Take it easy . He 's been through a ot . T ' take time . Guess you 're right . Maybe ' m rushing him . Brief him on the bacteria . We discovered a hybrid bacterium . It killed the baby reptile . T 's aso in Eizabeth 's G tract . - But it doesn 't affect her . - How about us ? We don 't even know about the Visitors . The twin was a mix of the two . It may be as dangerous as nerve gas or as harmless as baby food . - We need to test this stuff . - A lot . - It is time to feed them . - Okay , go on . - Hello . - Hi . - No way . - Why not ? Come on , even you woudn 't do that . In a cage or out . What 's the difference ? Why not ? - Is that the stuff ? - That 's it . We ' find some other way of testing it . All right , champagne and caviar . Nothing is too good for us . Right , Brian ? To the rewards of leadership . Yeah , all right . All right . Could you get that ? See , you get some power and suddenly you have lots of friends . - Delivery for Daniel Bernstein . - Right this way . Got two cases of California Brut . Who signs for it ? The good times don 't stop coming , do they ? - Didn 't order this . - We , didn 't either . - Maggie ? - Shut up . Yeah , we get upset when somebody tries to refuse delivery . American . But not at all inferior . You 're the punk that kied Ruby . You like hurting little old ladies , hey , punk ? She was a spy , and ' m proud of what I did . - You gonna kill him ? - As many times as I can . No . I got a better idea . - That 's it ? - Trust me . - Yes , who is this ? - Never mind who this is , just listen . One of your men was captured . I know who set him up . All right , tell me about it . His name is Daniel Bernstein . / saw the whole thing . - Is that the catch of the day ? - The one that got away . - Here you go , one live lizard . - Hopefully not for too long . - Robert ! - Get him out of here ! Take it easy , take it easy . - ' M not afraid . - You 're as dumb as you ook . Take him to the lab . Tell them I mean them no harm . I love you . Yeah , she 's crazy about you too , buddy . Steven . - Daniel . - Please , Steven , no more . Look , I am sorry about all this . Steven , didn 't do anything . I was set up . - That girl ... - What girl ? Maggie Blodgett , from the hospital . That nurse . We checked . There 's no nurse by that name . But you saw her . Think there 's a possibiity that you saw the chance to advance with Brian gone . - Brian was my friend . The ambitious have no friends . - ' M not ambitious . - I think you are . - What are you gonna do with me ? - Transfer you . Give you the opportunity to reflect , rest to think . ' Do whatever you want , Steven . I just thought ... - What ? - Well ... Nothing , just didn 't know what you 'd do with me . - What are you gonna do ? - Send you where you ' serve us we . - Where 's that ? - Where else ? On a serving platter . No ! Steven , no ! Robin . I knew you would come . - The child . Is she your sister ? - This is your daughter , Brian . This is Elizabeth . My daughter ? Our daughter . - ' M gad , Robin . - Why ? The three of us . We ' be together . Away from here , away from everyone . - Where will we go ? - Wherever you want . Wherever you want . Anywhere . Just so ong as we 're together . Don 't care where we go , Robin . Look . She knows ' m her father . Let me out of here , Robin . Let me hold her . Okay . What 's this ? What have you done ? Julie ! Donovan ! Robin 's used the toxin ! N the ab ! Robin . Robin . Robin , et 's go . Elizabeth ? - Where 's my baby ? - She 's with Father Andrew , she 's fine . He took her outside , it 's okay . Well we found out what it does to them . I wonder what it does to us . We shoud 've brought that " brown shirt . " Now we need another guinea pig . - Can 't pick anyone , that 's murder . - There 's penty of coaborators . - Your mother ? - That 's a cheap ... Julie . Julie ! - Where 's the key ? - She 's got it . Julie ! - You fool . - We needed an answer . Looks like we got some real red dynamite . Cages are very unpleasant , aren 't they ? I have a caller for you , Diana . - He claims to be an emissary of peace . - Bring him in . 'M Father Andrew Doye . 'M a Roman Cathoic priest . And this is Elizabeth . She 's our first interpanetary chid . - This is Robin Maxwe 's chid ? - Yes . Her growth is unprecedented . Do you think it 's dangerous ? She seems quite healthy . ' Have her examined . - You risk a great deal by bringing her . - Eizabeth 's an extraordinary chid . She 's a symbo of the universa unity of a God 's chidren . She can help bring peace between our two peoples . Or you 're afraid your peope will kill her . Yes , there was that factor . Look at her . She 's proof we 're made of the same genetic stuff . Surely this child demonstrates that harvesting human beings for food is nothing short of cannibalism . An argument for another time . Meanwhile , accept my hospitality . You ' be a right , Eizabeth . God bless you . Leave her with me , and treat the priest well . I shall . And what are we to do with you ? 'M getting awfu tired of moving , but this place sure beats that jail . I never figured the padre would go AWOL . I thought he was a standup guy . If you start believing in peace on earth there 's no teing how screwed up you ' get . - Why don 't you hep me in the ab ? - Don 't fee ike it . You can 't sit in this room a day . - Could you please just leave me alone ? - I know how you feel ... You always say that ! You have no idea how I feel ! Then why don 't we tak about it ? - How could Father Andrew steal her ? - After what happened to Brian he was afraid for Elizabeth . I would never hurt her . But he wasn 't sure of that . Wasn 't so sure of that . Didn 't reaize how much oved her until she was gone . We ' do everything to get her back , I promise . Even if we get her back , how can I face her ? I killed her father . How do I explain that ? You don 't . That 's the war , that 's part of the war . It had nothing to do with the war . I hated him so much because he used me . I killed him . - Doesn 't that make me a murderer ? - Don 't know . - We were gonna use the toxin on him . - That 's no answer . Don 't have any answers , Robin . Not now , not anymore . There are some things in life that we do , that later we deeply regret . I wanted to kill Elizabeth , once . I just keep seeing his face . Can 't forget his face . - I love you , Daddy . - I love you too . Know haven 't tod you in so ong . - How 's it going ? - Good . ' have it in a week . - Great . ' catch you ater . - Okay . - Hey , kiddo . How you doing ? - Hi . What 's Juie doing ? Developing a pill so our Visitor friends will be immune to the toxin . - The Fifth Column ? - That 's right . Aren 't the Fifth Coumn traitors to their own people ? That 's one way of seeing it , but their people are wrong . Wanna learn to pitch like Fernando Valenzuela ? No , ' stay here . Great . - Handling this stuff gives me shakes . - Don 't worry . They said it 's not harmfu to humans . - What about DDT , Agent Orange ... ? - I got the message . - Hey , guys . How 's it going ? - Excellent . The first shipment is going to the other fighters today . What ? We agreed not to ship the toxin until the pills were ready . - Ham ordered us to do it today . - He did , huh ? Tyer . Thought we 'd agreed not to ship this toxin until we developed a vaccine . - You want some eft aive . Don 't . - We 're this far because of their hep . 'M not gonna pay them back by killing them . If you let them live , Gooder , they 're gonna breed . I prefer them to you . I may bring the neighborhood down , they ' eat it . - Let 's unpack this stuff . - T 's going . Move it out . This shipment 's not going anypace . - Should we stop it ? - No , they 're grown , et them go . Hey ! Nice . Come on , guys , knock it off ! Didn 't know you fet so strongly about all this . The truck stays . - Preta-na-ma . - T 's not in our destiny . - Preta-na-ma . - No . You sent for me ? I think the Fifth Column plans to kill Father Andrew . Double his guard . - ' Reay your request to Pamea . - This is not a request . This is a command . I thought you knew . Pamela issued orders that military commands from you had to be cleared . I see . You may leave , captain . Very nice , dear . But remember what you work so hard to build , others take pleasure in tearing down . You must never give them the chance . - This is dangerous . - I had to see you . You 've started something disastrous . - What ? - This weapon ... - How do you ... ? - Listen . If they lose , the mothership can turn into a nuclear device capable of destroying Earth . - They ' annihiate everything . - You sure it 's not an empty threat ? 'Ve seen it . 'Ve seen them use it . - ' Te the others . - You tell them to stop . We ' be in contact . Martin we owe you much . I speak for us all . The man just presented his argument ! There is no argument ! We win , or we lose . There is no in-between . We 're not taking about just the people here . Be real clear . If we lose , the whole damn world loses . We 're not fighting the same war anymore . The rules have changed . T 's escaated out of contro . Yeah , see , war has a tendency to do that , ma 'am . 'M saying we 're not fighting a guerrilla war anymore . We face nuclear destruction . We 've had that threat for over 40 years . That was the threat . This is the reality . - They ' nuke us . - This is crazy . Not long ago , I was a gardener . She was a student . He worked in a factory . Now we 're panning the fate of the world . We 're the ony ones who can win . We better do it . - Can 't risk 3 biion ives . - How dare we even have this debate after they killed Mark and Ruby and they killed your wife , and your son . They 've made ife he for us . We 've a suffered . No one needs to be reminded . We all want quick and easy vengeance . This isn 't revenge . This is a one-way ticket to oblivion . They came to suck us dry . When they 're done with this panet , they ' toss it ike a can . No one 's caing them good guys or appealing to them . You can 't win a war if you 're extinct . We 've got to think of another way . There is no other way . There 's no time . If Martin knows about the red dust , then you can believe Diana does too . And if she doesn 't , she will in a few days . As raggedy and ordinary as this bunch is we 're the ast shot . - Last is exactly right . Now , if we attack ... If we attack , at least we have a fighting chance . We do nothing , and we 've signed this panet 's death warrant . Hate to say it , but for once I have to agree with Tyler . I say we attack . - I thought this was a secret ballot . - ' M sorry . 'Ve never fet more strongy about anything in my entire life . Yeah , et 's vote . So by a narrow margin the ones who voted for the attack have won . Personally , I think we just voted for Armageddon but I will abide by the decision . Donovan ? All right . Tyer 's gonna distribute the toxin . He ' ead the ground assaut . ' Ead the raid on Diana 's ship . Okay , Tyler . The pan 's simpe . We hit a the air bases across the country . Then use the jets to spread the toxin . Chris has detailed air base plans . You ' be put in groups , so wait until we get to you . That 's it . - Hi , Julie . - Hi . Were you just listening ? No , I was looking for my dad . Is he there ? - ' Te him you 're ooking for him . - Okay . - Hi . - Hi . - How 's guard duty ? - Boring . - Mike , ' m worried about Sean . - He seems fine to me . He called the Fifth Column traitors and doesn 't ike baseba . - What are you getting at ? - He was on Diana 's ship a ong time . - I know . - You know what they do . - What they did to me . - You think they converted my son ? 'M sorry . T kis me to be the one to have to tell you this but maybe it 's true . - No . They only had him asleep . He 's fine . I caught him spying outside the conference room . That 's enough . F anybody 's been converted , it 's you . - That 's not fair . - Let me tell you something . Don 't ever make me choose between my son and you . You ' ose , every time . Leave us . Well , what do you think ? I found your Bible very intriguing , Andrew . 'M so peased to hear you say that , Diana . Perhaps you 'd aow me to bring the word of God to your planet ? You 'd abandon your word to bring this to ours ? T 'd be a unique priviege . You 'd have as profound an effect on my people as you 've had on yours . - ' M ony a spokesman . He writes the words . You 're too humbe . I have found new strength of purpose because of our time together . - I thank you . - This praise is unexpected ... Self-assured ? You 've shown me my vunerabiities . I never allowed myself to experience them . I never knew they existed . And won 't aow them to exist anymore . Vulnerabilities , my dear priest , are exploitable weaknesses . 'D rather fight you than tell you what I have to tell you . And don 't wanna fight you . Your son 's been converted . Never had a chance , you know that . Know it 's rotten , but maybe not for what we have to do . If we change our plan , we can use him . Go easy on the dust , dudes . T ain 't gonna do you no good to snort it here . Elias . Pop , give me a break , please ? 'M just joking with the guys . - You assume ' m coming down on you . - Sn 't that how it 's aways been ? Perhaps so . I disagreed with what you said at the meeting . - So , what 's new ? - You said it well . I was damn proud of you , son . - Really ? - Yes . - Hey , Sean , come here a second . - Not now , I gotta run . I just wanna tell you something . - I love you , Sean . - I know , Dad . However things might change in the future , or get really crazy ... - ' sti ove you more than anyone . - Sure , Dad . I really gotta go . It was clever of you to get away . What have you learned of the weapon ? - T 's some germ . Don 't know . - What are they planning to do with it ? We 're gonna use jets to spray it in the air . - Where will they get the jets ? - They ' stea them from air bases . A common thief . That 's just ike your father . They really think a few jets can spray enough germs to do any harm ? They 've got friends in other cities . They 're gonna attack air bases around the country , at the same time . - When are they planning to do this ? - Can I have some cake ? - T 's impoite to change the subject . - But ' m sti hungry . Of course you can have cake , darling , as soon as you answer the question . - The raid 's tomorrow , at dawn . - Are you sure ? 'M positive . Here 's your cake , daring . Sn 't he a good boy ? - He 's gonna ike it here . - ' M sure . ' See you ater , Eeanor . Goodbye , Sean . T 's good to see you again , Juie . - Martin . - Hello , Donovan . - You just stop by for directions ? - We brought weapons and uniforms . - We 're with you now . - Good . - With your plan , we had no choice . - ' Think of something . At east there won 't be rats in the dorm anymore . I apologize for their rudeness . I hope that we can all be friends . With some of you , we ' never be friends . Let me introduce you to our team . This is Robert . - Yes ? - ' D ike to speak to you . - ' M busy right now . - / t 's about the rebel raids . How did you find out about them ? That 's cassified . 'M entited to know about them . The intelligence is from my source . You 're entited to scientific information only . You 're not taking it seriousy . Won 't base troop movements on the tattlings of a 10-year-old boy . I converted him . - The information 's reiabe . - I doubt your conversions . - ' Have someone ook into it . - When ? The raid is tomorrow . - You scientific types ruffle easily . - You military types are so predictable . You rely on cunning , intrigue . I prefer the direct approach . Don 't worry , dear Pamea . ' Do my scientific best to command your fleet . And tomorrow , ' destroy the rebes . Consider this an early retirement . - We 're ready when you are . - Okay , come on . This pill , it is safe ? The good news is that it 's safe . The bad news is , we don 't know for how ong . We ' survive . - ' Ve tasted worse . - When ? Thinking about tomorrow ? 'M thinking about Sean . You don 't know how rotten I felt to be the one to tell you . Don 't bame you . 'M sorry for what said . Thanks . And you shoudn 't blame Sean , either . He 's not a traitor or a spy . He 's just a itte boy who coudn 't fight back ike did . - Don 't bame him . I blame them . You think they ' beieve his story ? I hope so . Baker flight commander departing to Edwards Air Force Base on schedule . - Security forces in G-sector are ready . - Good . Proceed . Denver squadron reports deployment at China Lake . K - sector commander reporting to mothership . - Why is Pamela deploying troops ? - She 's dead . She chose a Fifth Columnist as her guard . ' m in charge now . How dare you deploy troops without my authority . Pamela started this before she died . 'M simpy carrying out her orders . The rebels are mounting a series of raids . We have the opportunity to wipe out the entire network . Ridiculous . What could they accomplish by raiding air bases ? - Their jets are useless against us . - They plan to disperse a toxic weapon . Aren 't we innocuated against all Earthly bacteria ? They think they 've made a new one . - Is that possible ? - Perhaps . Don 't worry . We ' ensure that the toxin never sees daylight . - You 've amassed quite an army . - I want this victory to be decisive . - That shoudn 't be too difficut . - And if we fail there 's aways this . I hope we never have to use this . This is your high and low power . This controls three scope sizes . - Is there a safety ? - Yeah , down here . Don 't bow your foot off . - You gonna be okay ? - ' Be fine , thanks . I have to check the other squad . Anything you need ? No , we got it . - Good luck . - You too . Good luck ! Where are they ? Where are they ? I expected an attack at dawn . Wonder what they 're up to ? Those Earthlings are stupid . That makes them unpredictable . Come on ! Let 's move it . Go ahead . Release time is 1100 . If you make 10,000 feet before then , hold on . We gotta let the others reach Master Control , okay ? Come on ! Go ! Tanker 00028 , establish radio contact . This is tanker 00028 , requesting permission to refuel . You 're not isted , 00028 . We were activated by auxiliary to help the offensive on Earth . We have Code 7 orders to refuel and return immediately . Hold on . Tanker 00028 , permission to land and refuel granted . Tanker captain 00028 , bring your fight og to the controer 's booth . Tanker captain 00028 to the controller 's box . Tanker 00028 , checking in . - We lost contact with the landing bay . - Go to backup . Go ! Halt ! Don 't et them escape ! Cover me ! That 's the downoad hose , there 's the vent . - Let 's get these bodies out of here ! - You two , give me a hand here . - Put it right on the front porch . - No problem . Okay , three degrees left . Nice shot . What are you doing ? Are we leaving ? - Help me . - What can I do ? - Tell them I surrender ! Say anything ! - I will . Don 't shoot , don 't shoot ! 'M one of you . - Hold your fire ! - Their leader is here . He 's been hoding me prisoner ! Let 's go ! Say good night , hotshot . Here . - You 're ate . - Nice to see you too . - This will protect you from the toxin . - What 's that ? Our most advanced decoder . In case they arm the doomsday device . This way . This is the main air vent . We can reach the rest of the ship . T 's gonna take a whie . T 's a big ship . Ready ? Yeah , go ahead , shoot it ! What 's going on ? Where are the other guards ? - Testing the ventilation sensors . - Wasn 't informed of any tests . Let me see your passes . Here , ' ve got one . What 's that ? Sensors detect a foreign substance . - What foreign substance ? - The rebels are onboard . - They 're putting toxin in the air . - Our troops are on Earth . ' Shut off the contaminants in outer sectors and put Master Control in auxiiary . T 's impenetrabe . - Good . - Then we ' round them up and be done with them . - Finally . Defense alert on the mothership . All troops proceed to battle stations . Code 9 orders to secure the landing bay and corridors . Repeat , we have a Code 9 defense alert . - They know . - We 're gonna have to hurry . Halt ! Identify yourselves ! Hurry ! We gotta take off as soon as possible . - What 's the matter ? - Jammed . We gotta switch tanks . We 're behind schedue . The troops will be here soon . - Okay , get ready . - Ready ! Willie ! - Any other way out ? - No . Why aren 't they dying ? - They 've found your peope . - Without the dust , we 're done . This plan was ill-considered from the start ! Don 't die , Harmony . You 've gotta go . T 's not safe . Please , Harmony . I love you . - Go . - No . No , won 't eave you here . Commander , return immediately with as many troops as you can muster . Right . We 're on our way . They 're cornered in the corridor and landing bay . They don 't stand a chance . - Haul down that flag ! - Can 't , it 's stuck . Give me that . Get back ! - We did it ! - Yeah , but did they do it ? This could be a very short celebration . Get them ! Finish them off ! - T 's amost 1100 , et 's go ! - We ' never make it in time . Master Control is sealed . We have to go through here . - Report . - There are thousands of balloons . - I saw . What are they doing ? - Nothing . Just rising . Why would someone release balloons and just let ... ? Diana , are you still there ? - And the other motherships ? - They 've all seen balloons . Keep me informed . Do they think balloons will divert us from the airfields ? Don 't you understand ? The bases were the diversion . They 're not using jets . The toxin 's in the baoons . Miions of baoons coudn 't deliver enough toxin to do harm . They only need a small amount in the panet 's food and water chain . T 's a bacteria . T wi mutipy . Very quickly everything on Earth will be poison to us . You just shot one down . The chain reaction will kill us all . They knew we would . They 're more cever than thought . - A fatal miscalculation for us . - You 're safe here . Don 't reish the idea of spending my life in here with you . Damn them . This is Simon Vander , reporting from Rome where thousands have gathered in St. Peters to celebrate our victory over the Visitors . Similar reports are pouring in from around the globe . People are tasting their first breath of freedom in a very long time . Since the first balloons were spotted over the United States there 's a sense of excitement unparalleled since the end of World War / / . One million people watched the New York mothership rise above the Statue of Liberty and fly off into space . But the Los Angeles mothership has not left . There are rumors it may have been left as an ultimate weapon . The National Security Council will meet later today . Our ships are clear . Hurry . We ' eave , but ' destroy their precious Earth first . We 've ost . Don 't you understand ? T 's over . Or can 't your vanity hande realty ? - What ? - T 's jammed . Blow it . Six , five , four , three , two ... - They 're breaking through . - Give me your key . No , ' not be part of this obscene destruction . - What 's hoding this ? - A special alloy . - We need another charge . - Go . Give me your key . Get back . Machine armed . Five minutes to critical mass . Pamela underestimated your ambition . You stupid , feeble man . If not for me , you 'd sti be deciding where to and . You and your petty , idiotic intrigue wondering who was in charge . I was in charge ! I directed this entire operation while you made pretty speeches . I had the power , and you wore the crown . The crown . T 's yours now , Diana . Enjoy your reign . Queen of a poisoned realm . Four minutes until critical mass . Come , Eizabeth . T 's time to go . Go on . Get our people off the ship . Get us out of the atmosphere . - We won 't make it ! Not enough power . - Try , damn it . If we can find a program code , we can stop it . - Has anyone ever disarmed one before ? - Never . Three minutes until critical mass . Optimum power . We ' break apart before we 're cear . Keep going . T 's our ony chance . Few more minutes and we ' disintegrate . - Two minutes . - Nothing , ' m getting nothing . The decision is irreversible . We can 't give up . Let me try . We 're osing power ! Two engines have failed . Keep going ! - There 's nothing more can do ! - Try ! One minute until critical mass . Julie . Julie , you must listen to me . Stay where you are . Don ' t move . Be careful . The monster 's here . / f you move , he 'll find you . Don ' t move , Julie . / f you stand still , you 're safe . Achieved critical mass . Thirty seconds until detonation . Thirty seconds . Preta-na-ma . - What does that mean ? - T means " peace . " Take us home .

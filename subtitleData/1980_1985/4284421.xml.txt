 ( SEAGULLS CAWING ) ( PEOPLE SHOUTING ) Help me . No ! Hold on . Let go ! Help ! MAN : The boy . Get the boy ! Father ! Give us a hand , son . Hurry . ( SCREAMS ) Hurry , son . I can 't hold them off much longer . Father ! ( WHINING ) ( DOOR CLOSING ) TOM : Just leave him at home . ELIZABETH : I can 't . You know that . I don 't believe it . Every time , every time it happens like this . What do you want me to do ? Put him out on the street ? Can it , Ralph . Look , he 's my nephew . He doesn 't have anybody else . I don 't care . I just don 't want him to ruin our trip to Cancun . Look , can 't you send him off someplace ? Send him off to ... Yeah , that 's right . Where ? You tell me where and I 'll do it . Look , do you think I like being saddled with an 11-year-old kid ? Oh , why did Bill and Cathy have to die ? ( PLUMMETING ) ( THUDDING ) ( MAN GRUNTING ) ( MAN MUTTERING ) ( RALPH BARKING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( BARKING ) Smoking bat 's breath ! Could 've killed me . When did they start building them this high ? This isn 't 1492 . Where 's Columbus , kid ? Where am I ? ( SNARLING ) Ralph ! He 's got my book . Ralph , let go ! Keep your lousy fangs off of me . Ralph , come on . Ralph , give it up . Let go ! ( JEFFREY SCREAMING ) ( PLUMMETING ) ( GRUNTS ) Just once I 'd like to land on a haystack . A nice , soft , sweet-smelling haystack . Are we alive ? Alive ? Oh , no . Yeah , we 're alive . What year was that ? I got to get you back . What year ? Year . And don 't tell me 1492 . I know for a fact they didn 't have buildings like that in 1492 . They do in ' 82 . ( LAUGHS ) A joker . Funny . We 'll try that again 'cause you 're a nice kid . What year ? 1982 . And I 'd like to know where we are right now . Son , I 'm not a man known for being patient . This here Omni 's only got circuits to 1970 . The only way I can get you to ' 82 is if the lousy thing ... ( OMNI BEEPING ) Bat 's breath ! It 's losing it again in the automatic mode . Bat 's breath ? Do you know how difficult it is to field strip one of these things ? Where 's my Guidebook ? Got to be around here somewhere . Well , help me , will you ? Is it black ? Yeah . Now look . Can 't do a lousy thing without it . About this big ? Right . Right . You got it there ? No . Ralph does . Ralph ? My dog . Dog . You mean the big , furry thing with all the teeth . Ralph . In 1982 ? ( BOGG MUTTERS ) Do you know what you 've done ? History 's going to change because you couldn 't control your shaggy , little mutt . Empires are going to fall . Wars are going to rage . I 'm going to lose my job . Your job ? Who do you think you are ? You break into my room . You knock me out a window . You bring me here , wherever I am . You deserve to lose your lousy job ! Yeah ? Yeah ! Smart kids give me a pain . Hey , where are we going ? ( CHUCKLES ) Where am I going ? I 'm going to salvage what 's left of my job . You 're going to get lost . I am lost . ( BABY GURGLING ) Hey ! Hey , what ? Is this what you 're looking for ? JEFFREY : Well , is it ? I don 't know . You don 't know ? If I had my Guidebook , I 'd know . Now , I 've just got to guess . ( BEEPING ) Check the old Omni . Nope . Not it . Not what ? Not right . Well , if you 'd tell me what 's going on here , I might be able to help . Who are you ? What are you ? What am I ? I am a voyager . You ever hear of one ? Of course not . No one has . We 're the people that are plucked out of time and trained to travel through the ages to help history along . You know , give it a shove where it 's needed . Problem is , though , you see , there was this blonde in my class , real nice legs and she got a mole right here , and this kind of mysterious way of talking . Kind of distracted me , you know ? Maybe you don 't know . Anyway , I figured I didn 't have to pay attention . The Guidebook tells you what you gotta do . But your Guidebook ... Was your fur coat 's dinner . So , here I am . In Egypt , 1450 B.C. And I haven 't got the foggiest idea what I 'm supposed to do . ( BABY GURGLES ) You got an idea , kid ? This is Egypt . 1450 B.C. Maybe I 'm supposed to feed him . We traveled through time ? Got some beef jerky here somewheres . Moses ! What ? Hey , be careful with him , will you ? He 's Moses . Moses ? Moses was an old man with white whiskers . Looks like Santa Claus with a part in the middle . What are you doing ? Putting him back in the water . He 'll drown . ( SHUSHING ) Look . Moses was found by the pharaoh 's daughter , in the Nile . ( DINGS ) That 's it . Green light . How 'd you know ? My dad was a history professor . Let me see . Which one do you press to ... ( PEOPLE YELLING ) ( PLUMMETING ) You little toad . Don 't you ever , ever touch this ... Oh , no . ( EXCLAIMS ) Hey , easy . It 's okay , kid . They almost ran over us . That ought to give you a pretty good idea why you 'll never touch this Omni again . What am I saying ? Nice to know you , kid . Sorry for any inconvenience , but I work alone . Oh , no , you don 't . You got me into this , you 're getting me out . I got school tomorrow . Can 't take you back . I don 't even know where I am . France , 1918 . The Revolutionary War . First World War . What ? The First World War . Right . ( HORSE NEIGHING ) ( GUN FIRING ) Those the good guys ? Yeah . ( YELLING ) Hold it right there ! That thing 's dangerous . Will you put that down before ... We 're the good guys . Then get us out of here . Help me with this jacket , will you ? Where do you think you 're going ? To create a little diversion . Motor Transportation 1A . When you want it to go ... Motor Transportation 1A . The clutch . Oh , the clutch . Bat 's breath . Come on , we 'd better get inside . Think he 'll come back ? He better . Who is he , anyway ? My father . Oh . Motor Transportation 1A . Wanna get off . Jump ! ( SPEAKING GERMAN ) ( OMNI BEEPING ) So much for motorcycles . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) ( EXCLAIMING ) Bat 's breath ! Will you stop it ? " Bat 's breath " ? Is that you ? No , it 's General Eisenhower . Eisenhower ? Wrong war . Don 't they have light in here ? Oh , yeah , we found some lamps . ( STAMMERING ) Hey , I 'm really sorry . First I try to shoot you , and now this . We didn 't really hurt you or anything , did we ? Hurt me ? You two ? No . Okay . Where 'd you get the uniform ? You don 't want to know . How is he ? He 's better . He 's still unconscious but your son here was able to stop the bleeding . My what ? It was a clean shoulder wound . But his fever 's coming down . We were on our way to an entertainers troupe on the front line when the zeppelins attacked . There were bombs everywhere . The corporal here took the only road out , but it put us behind enemy lines . And here we are . You know who this is ? No , son , but I 'm sure you 'll introduce us . This is Mary Murphy . Mary Murphy , the actress ? And this is my father . Phineas Bogg . Phineas ? Phineas . Now , it 's obvious we 've got to get these two back where they belong . So why don 't you stay and watch the corporal for a while , while I go out and look for a truck ? I 'll go with you . Not in that , you won 't . Well , how about this ? It 's perfect . So instead of stumping for war bonds at home , I decided to come here and boost the boys ' morale . You sure boost mine . I heard about your wife . Wife ? Jeffrey told me how she died . Oh , Jeffrey . You know , I think it 's wonderful the way you 're bringing him up on your own . I really haven 't done that much . You 're modest . I love a modest man . I 'm very modest . Do you ever think about coming to Hollywood ? You know , you really remind me of Doug . Doug ? Yeah . Fairbanks . The swashbuckler . Doug . Listen , could we get back to the modesty part ? Is that what we 're looking for ? Where ? Over there . Perfect . Now if we can only get those two away from there ... Kiss me . No problem . How could you do this to me ? Do you know what this does to me ? What are you doing ? No ! Don 't touch me . I hate you ! I hate you ! ( CRYING ) Eddie Rickenbacker ? You 're the Eddie Rickenbacker ? Yeah , sure , I guess . Corporal Eddie Rickenbacker . Columbus , Ohio . Well , what are you doing here ? Kid , I was gonna ask you . But you 're the number one ace . You should be up in the air dogfighting . Dogfighting ? I hate to tell you , but dogs don 't fly . The only thing that 's up in the air these days is zeppelins , and the Jerries are taking us to the cleaners with them . You mean we 're losing the war ? You better like sauerkraut . But what about airplanes ? You just go up in the air and shoot the zeppelins down . Aeroplanes ? Oh , kid , they can barely get those things off the ground . That Bleriot guy who invented them keeps landing in the English Channel . Bleriot ? But what about the Wright brothers ? Who ? Uh-oh ! Kid ! Where you going ? That was my fianc√© . It 's so low , what he did to me . He 's terrible , he 's awful , he 's hideous . Phineas ! Bat 's breath . Halt ! The truck . Hey ! ( BOGG MUTTERING ) What the heck ? How does this thing ... The clutch . Clutch . SOLDIER : Stop . Stop the truck . Of all the times . I know what 's wrong here . What 's wrong here is you . Halt . ( GUNS FIRING ) Did you see where Mary was when you came running around the side ? Got to go back and get her . There aren 't any airplanes . What ? SOLDIER : Stop it . Stop the truck . Airplanes ! That 's what we have to change . Without airplanes , the Germans are gonna win the war . The Germans didn 't win the war ? ( TIRES SCREECHING ) Hang on , kid , look out . SOLDIER : Capture them . Catch them alive . Someday , somewhere in time , I 'm gonna ... Look , can you set that Omni thing any place in time ? You bet , and when I find the guy who invented this contraption ... Look , forget the truck . The corporal with Mary is Eddie Rickenbacker . So ? So he was the top US flying ace . Problem is , there aren 't any airplanes around to fly in . He 's never even heard of the Wright brothers . Yeah , that makes two of us . Wright brothers ? Kitty Hawk , North Carolina , 1903 . Kid , you better be right . Hang on . BOGG : Well , thanks for your trouble . That 's another one , kid . Face it . No one here has even heard of the Wright brothers . Red light still blinking ? ( OMNI BEEPING ) Like crazy . That 's because they 're not here . We got to go to Dayton . Dayton ? You foul up our escape , make me leave Mary in the middle of the First World War , dragging me halfway around the world to find a couple of guys who 's not even here , and you expect me to take you to Dayton ? That 's where their bicycle shop is . No , kid , this is it . Time to part our ways . You 're in America , same century . That may be the best I can do . So why don 't we just ... Can it . You 're stuck with me until you put me back in my room where you got me . Besides , you don 't know anything about history . You 'll mess the whole thing up . Yeah ? And what 's this father business , huh ? I haven 't met a girl like that in 300 years and you tell her you 're my son ? You know what that could do to my reputation ? What about your own father ? What would he say ? My father 's dead . Yeah , and if he 's anything like me , you probably did him in , too . Just shut up ! Hey , Jeff ! I 'm sorry . Jeffrey ! Come on , man . ( EXCLAIMS ) Sorry , man . No . No , let me go ! Let me go ! Easy , Jeff . No . Hey , hey , easy . No , no , no . Easy , Jeffrey . No . Let me go . ( CRYING ) Let me go , let me go . ( CRYING ) It 's gonna be okay , Jeff . I 'm sorry . We were going camping up north . I was in the camp reading some comics . I don 't know , Dad must 've fallen asleep . 'Cause we ran off the road into some trees . I was all right . But Mom and Dad got real smashed up . I tried to get them out . But there was this fire . I went up to the road , to try to get someone to help . But no one would stop . I couldn 't get anyone to stop . Don 't blame yourself , kid . Just get some rest . ( SIGHING ) Dayton . ( HORN HONKING ) ( NEIGHING ) Will you stop that ? I can 't help it . They itch , they 're hot . They make me feel stupid . It wasn 't my idea to come to Dayton . Well , this is it . It certainly is . Good afternoon . Forget it , Bogg . She 's a blonde . BOGG : Nice day . AGNES : It certainly is . Phineas Bogg . Agnes Spence . Come on , Romeo , I found us a job . It 's my nephew . Oh ! WILBUR : You had no business doing it . ORVILLE : Well , I didn 't think I 'd have to ask your permission . Of course not , because you knew what I 'd say . Good morning . You gents looking for some help ? Morning . Just a minute . She wanted me to ask her out . You know that she 's my girl , Orville . Well , this hurts to say , Will . But Agnes doesn 't even like you . Oh , that 's news to me . In fact , she thinks this whole flying idea of yours is crazy and childish . Gentlemen , excuse me . Just one minute , wait a second . Flying is my idea ? Who spent 10 days flying this box kite , huh ? Who , huh ? Huh ? Who spent four sleepless nights designing these wings ? Huh ? Who worked for a solid month building this model ? And you 're calling me childish ? Childish , childish . Childish is working six months on a glider that won 't fly in a crosswind . Childish . Childish is wanting to ride this thing off a big rock cliff . Mature . Mature is putting it away before someone gets hurt . Agnes likes her men mature . WILBUR : Mature . Agnes likes her men mature , does she ? Well , Wilbur , that 's what she told me . Well , maybe I 've matured , too . Hey , guys , I think this has gone far enough , really ... Maybe I don 't care too much about younger brothers , flying machines or bicycle shops . Maybe I matured so much that I 've had it with this whole kit and caboodle . You know , I really don 't think Agnes would want you two to be arguing like this . Oh , you ain 't got the maturity of a billy goat , Wilbur . We 're finished , you hear that ? We 're through . We 're through ! Agnes ? Well , kid , guess we got the job . JEFFREY : And this whole thing 's because of a girl ? Because of a girl ? Kid , wars have been fought over women . Some day you 'll understand . But I really wouldn 't blame Agnes . This is a case of three people being confused about what they really want . Agnes thinks she wants love , when all she really cares about is romance . Orville and Wilbur think they want Agnes , when all they really care about is flying . Think this will work ? If I read them right . They see this fly and Agnes is a memory . How 's it look ? Terrific . Let 's hear the notes to the boys . JEFFREY ... " Dearest Wilbur , I have so many things to tell you . " Orville means nothing to me . Meet me at Big Rock ... " " Dearest Orville , I have so many things to tell you . " Wilbur means nothing to me . " Meet me at Big Rock Creek , this morning at 10 ... 00 . " BOGG ... Dearest Agnes , my heart stopped when I saw you outside the shop . Forget the Wright brothers . I 'll be at Big Rock Creek this morning at 10 ... 00 waiting to prove my soaring love . Yours forever , Phineas Bogg . It 's a long way down . Uh-huh . Think they 'll come ? They 'll come . Think it 'll fly ? As long as there isn 't a crosswind . Whoa . ( CLICKING TONGUE ) Whoa . Phineas ! Phineas ? ( WIND HOWLING ) JEFFREY : Too windy , Bogg . Forget it , you can 't fly in this . BOGG : Can you see them ? They 're almost up to her . Get that left side down . Hold it down . I can 't , there 's too much wind . Where are they now ? For you , darling . Sorry my brother had to be so immature as to follow me . Follow you ? I think it 's time we ended this once and for all . Tell him , Agnes . Tell him what ? Tell him about the note you wrote me . What note , Orville ? " Meet me at Big Rock at 10 : 00 . " So that I can whisper the secrets of ... " " ... my love in your precious ear . " All my love , " BOTH : " Agnes . " Cat 's out of the bag . Got to go now . You can 't , Bogg . Not in a crosswind . Out of the way , boy . It 's suicide . I 'm a voyager , kid . Sometimes you 've gotta bite the bullet . No ! Bogg , don 't ! No ! Come on , move it , horse . Let 's go ! ( PROMPTING HORSES ) I don 't know what to say , Wilbur , Orville . This is not my handwriting . Well , then who in tarnation ... Phineas ! " Waiting to prove my soaring love . " Our glider ! Will , it 's our glider ! And it 's flying . AGNES : Phineas ! ( ALL LAUGHING ) It 's flying . Look , look . Straighten out . Be careful . ( LAUGHING ) WILBUR : Keep your weight down . AGNES : Be careful , Phineas . Weight back . Who the heck is it ? Some darn fool . Weight back , weight back . Doesn 't this thing ever come down ? Phineas ! I had to ask . Bogg ! He 's going down ! Bat 's breath ! JEFFREY : Bogg ! Bogg ! No , no , Bogg , you can 't die . ( GRUNTS ) Bogg ? Easy , kid , will you ? Do you always treat your friends like that ? But I saw you crash ! I thought ... Yeah , I know . I know . I 'm glad to see you , too . Do you mind ? Oh , sorry . Phineas ! Phineas ! Oh , Phineas ! Your soaring love , it was wonderful . Oh , look at you . Are you all right ? A little worse for wear , darling . But now I know more than ever that I want to marry you . Marry me ? Yes . Ever since the first day I saw you , I knew we 'd grow old together . You and me and our 10 children . Ten children ? Why don 't you wait for me in the buggy ? I 'll be right there . Wilbur , Orville . Doggone , that was beautiful . Wilbur and Orville Wright . Jeffrey Jones , Phineas Bogg . Howdy . You know , the problem you had up there was lift . I was thinking , maybe if we made the elevators a little bit bigger . Mount the first forward , see ? We need to put a man inside , not hanging . And then we can double up the rudders and stack the wings for more lift . We 'll need a long run , steady wind . You know , Will , there 's this place in North Carolina , Kitty Hawk . Kitty Hawk , yeah . ( DINGS ) Green light , kid . But we can 't leave now , not yet . Got to . But they 're going to invent the airplane . We can be there , we could help . We 've helped enough already . Look , I know it 's hard . I 've been there , too . But whenever you feel this way , you got to think of all the interesting people in front of you , who really need your help . Heck , we 're voyagers , kid . We got responsibilities . Besides , don 't you wanna see what all this has done ? Yeah . Phineas . You know , I 've really been thinking . It 's about those 10 children . I really think that I 'm just too young to have 10 children . Phineas ? ( PLUMMETING ) A haystack ! Green light ? ( BEEPING ) Still red . Now where are your planes , kid ? We put Orville and Wilbur back on the right track . They got to be around here somewhere . I suppose red could mean that something else is wrong . Oh , we 'll find out soon enough . Run , kid ! Right behind you . Terrific , wonderful . We get airplanes into the war so they can blow us to bits . Who was that guy ? It was red . Richthofen . Richthofen ? The guy with Mary ? Rickenbacker . Richthofen is the Red Baron . Hey , is that Eddie ? Mary . We got to get them out of there . Eddie , Mary ! Who are you ? Jeffrey Jones . That was another war , kid . I 'm Phineas Bogg . This is Jeff , my son . We 're here to help you . You okay ? That arm looks pretty bad . EDDIE : I 'm alive . Which is more than I can say for the guys in the escort plane . MARY : We were on our way to an entertainment troupe on the front lines when the Baron shot us down . Hit the deck ! Why didn 't he fire ? He wants me . Top German meets top American . But you can 't go up in one of those . Not in the two-seater . He 'll cream you . It 's all right , kid . He 's not going to . Take off your jacket and scarf . At this distance , he 'll never know the difference . Forget about it , pal . You 're in no shape to take him on . Not in one of those . Fly Mary out of here . We 'll take care of the Baron . It 's worth a shot . You know how to fly one of these things ? Did Marie Antoinette have great legs ? If you go first , will he wait for me ? Yeah , Baron doesn 't shoot an unarmed plane . His code of honor . He 'll never attack . Good luck , pal . Well , I don 't know who you guys are , but thanks a million . You know , I get the strangest feeling that we 've met somewhere before . Maybe in another war . Listen , If you 're ever in Hollywood ... What about Doug ? Who 's Doug ? Good luck . Hey , why 'd you lie to him ? You can 't fly one of these things . I didn 't lie . I never lie . Marie Antoinette had terrible legs . Climb down , kid . I 'm doing this solo . Oh , no , you don 't . You go down , I go down . Forget it . Who 's gonna shoot the gun ? No discussion . That 's it . Get down . Hey , where is the clutch ? The thing doesn 't have a clutch . Smart kids give me a pain . JEFFREY : Hold on , here we go . Remember the Maine . Remember the what ? The stick . The stick ? What about the trees ? The stick ! Pull up on the stick . Oh , that stick . We 're flying ! ( GUN FIRING ) He 's right behind you . Get him off your tail . Pull up . JEFFREY : That 's it , we lost him . We lost him . JEFFREY : Put the nose down . We 're gonna stall . We 're gonna what ? Pull up ! Pull up ! I can 't . JEFFREY : Then push down . Where is he now ? He 's right on our tail . Shoot him . Shoot him . I am . Try to hit him . JEFFREY : He 's coming right at us ! I got him . I got him ! We got him ! That 's it . Green light , kid . We did it . We did it . ( ENGINE SPUTTERING ) We 're going to go down , kid . Hold on , kid . Hold on . This will hopefully help me now . ( EXPLOSION ) We 're alive . Yeah , we made it . And Eddie and Mary ? BOGG : Green light , kid . All the way . You liked her , didn 't you ? Me ? No . What makes you say that ? I don 't know . It 's just the way you looked at her . Sort of mushy . Not like Agnes . Yeah , well , forget the way I looked at her . We 're voyagers , kid . We have no time for romance . Right , voyagers . No romance . Time is our oyster . Oyster , right . Quarter to no man . No man . And we can do anything , change anything , be anything . Voyagers . Voyagers . ( CANNON BOOMING ) You hear that ? Sounded like a cannon . Where are we ? England . 1066 , Pearl Harbor . That 's it . That 's what 's wrong . They didn 't have cannons in 1066 . Battle of Hastings . Battle of what ? BOGG : Oh , no . Bat 's breath . Not again . JEFFREY ...

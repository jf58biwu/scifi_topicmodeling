You want to go for it ? Good gag . You pull this one a lot ? Only on the women . It never fails . Excuse me ? Miss Magruder ? I have something here for you . Mmm , how utterly charming . Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Motherfucker ! Lite ! I 'm blind , man . Bruce I Peason , brokerage consultant . Fucking millionaire , six payments behind . - I 've never understood it . - What 's that ? The fucking millionaires . They never pay their bills . See you at the yard . - Let me get this one . - No , I 'll handle this one . Mr Peason is carrying a permit for a pistol . - Hey ! Hey , hey ! Give me that . - Don 't underestimate me , Ace . And also , naturally , I would like them to be right next to each other .

I walk into someone 's place of work . They 're shit scared . They know I 'm not a cop . They think I 've come to kill ' em and I would . I 'd kill anybody who crosses me . You know what I mean ? - Do you like music ? - Sure . In that case you 're going to love this . I was into these dudes before anybody . Partied with them all the time . Asked me to be their manager . I called bullshit on that . Managing a pop group ? Hey , ain 't no job for no man . Did you read that book I gave you ? - What book ? - Dioretix . - Science of matter over mind . - Uh-uh . You 'd better read it and quick . That book will change your life . Found it in a Maserati in Beverly Hills . You know what I mean ? A lot of people don 't realise what 's really going on . They view life as a bunch of unconnected incidents and things . They don 't realise that there 's this , like , lattice of coincidence that lays on top of everything . I 'll give you an example , show you what I mean . Suppose you 're thinking about a plate of shrimp . Suddenly somebody will say , like , " plate " or " shrimp " or " plate of shrimp " , out of the blue , no explanation . No point in looking for one either . It 's all part of a cosmic unconsciousness . You eat a lot of acid , Miller , back in the hippie days ? I 'll give you another instance . You know the way everybody 's into weirdness right now ? Books in all the supermarkets about Bermuda triangles . UFOs , how the Mayans invented television . That kind of thing . I don 't read them books . Well , the way I see it it 's exactly the same . There ain 't no difference between a flying saucer and a time machine . People get so hung up on specifics , they miss out on seeing the whole thing . Take South America , for example . In South America , thousands of people go missing every year . Nobody knows where they go . They just , like , disappear . But if you think about it for a minute you realise something . There had to be a time when there was no people , right ? Yeah , I guess . Well , where did all these people come from ? Hmm ? I 'll tell you where . The future . Where did all these people disappear to , hmm ? - The past ? - That 's right ! - And how did they get there ? - How the fuck do I know ? Flying saucers . Which are really ... Yeah , you got it . Time machines . I think a lot about this kind of stuff . I do my best thinking on the bus . That 's how come I don 't drive , see ? You don 't even know how to drive . I don 't want to know how . I don 't want to learn , see ? The more you drive the less intelligent you are . You know , I think I saw one of those things once , them UFOs . I mean it was really ... it was kind of scary . I saw all these fucking coloured lights and , uh , sounds . I mean , sounds and lights like I never heard before . I mean it was really weird . Bud .. Yeah ? Do you think all repo men follow the code ? Of course . Well , I mean you see a lot of fucked up cars come in , but ... 99 times out of 100 , it 's the customer who fucks them up . Assholes . I 'm offering a thousands dollars for his Falcon . You know what that is , Napoleon ? It 's a bribe . 'Who the hell is this ? Napoleon ? 'Who the fuck are you calling ? ' It 's a grand if you show me where his car is , Napoleon . 'Ah , go fuck yourself , asshole . ' Hello ? Prick . Sixty-four Chevy Malibu . Twenty grand . Waiting ! We could buy ten of them for that , Marlene . - Think you can find it now ? - ( Bud ) Not going anywhere ! Now how come this junk is worth so much ? What 's in it ? Drugs ? Got all night , amigos . Hermanos Rodriguez don 't approve of drugs . Neither do I , but it 's my birthday . I 'm going to get your ass ! That motherfucker 's still down there . Don 't care how long it takes , dildos .

Free , my ass ! What are you , a fucking commie ? - Huh ? - No , I ain 't no commie . Well , you 'd better not be . I don 't want no commies in my car . No Christians , either .

 Death to the enemy . ( GRUNTS ) Restoration for our ancient way . Believe me , you don 't want anything to do with this one , it 's potentially suicidal . Saint John and Jo have just vanished into thin air . When one cannot kill the bull , there 's always pleasure in killing the calf . ( GRUNTING ) The time has come . Goodbye , Mr. Hawke . ( PROJECTOR WHIRRING ) Pardon , Commander . I was told to report to you the moment I returned . The lights . HAYASHl : Joanna Santini . It would seem she operates this little charter company with Mr. Hawke . And these two ? Major Michael Rivers , the United States Air Force . This one , Jason Locke . We have suspicions that he is connected with government security . They visit quite frequently . Friends , perhaps . This one , Commander ... Hawke ! This must be him . There is always the memory of the father in the face of the son . When one cannot kill the bull , Hayashi , there is always pleasure in killing the calf . You must confirm this . About my plane ? Entering soon as cargo through the Port of Seattle . Fumio is handling all the details . Good . Rewind this for me . It is almost time . Time for the heavenly winds to blow . ( GRUNTS ) Doing thermal sweeps , huh ? No , it 's a camera mount for a 16-millimeter . Some foreign investor wants property aerials along the Cheemunga River tomorrow . You hear from Saint John yet ? Yeah , I gave him your message . He said he 'd meet you here in the morning . But you 're gonna have to find somebody else to play with . This guy specifically requested Saint John fly for him tomorrow . You tell that to the Pentagon , Jo . This is a military priority . Nevada weapons range . Some groundlair cooperation number . Hey , does he ever tell you where he 's going ? Doesn 't tell you either ? ( LAUGHS ) Just mumbles something about deep meditation and points his motorcycle towards the mountains . Hmm . He 's not too chatty about it , is he ? ( SCOFFS ) Can 't you just tell the Pentagon he 's busy . You tell ' em . Well , I hate to break a promise . Look , give me a hand . You got it . YAHARA : You are my loyal retainers . My loyal samurai . Sworn to uphold the code of Bushido . And the oath of our purpose . ( ALL TOASTING IN JAPANESE ) Death to the enemy . Restoration for our ancient way . Report ! This is the main block here . Nuclear reactor here . Emergency core cooling next to it . I 've circled the vulnerable strike point in red . And after impact ? Fires . Core meltdown . Even given moderate winds , the result will be widespread and totally devastating . Fumio . Is my plane properly equipped ? For the strike , 300-kilo bombs . Trinitroanisole with contact fuses . For defense purposes , 23-millimeter cannons . Two Atoll heat-seekers with nuclear heads . The plane , as you know , will be dockside this week . Excellent . Surveillance cameras and monitors are all in our possession . The day of the divine wind is at hand . Your fate is before you . Swear your willingness to die . Kamiyama . You alone have placed a triangle over your name . I believe , master , I can better serve our cause with my life . Since you have not chosen death , we will choose it for you . Please , master ! Permit me to think again . Hayashi . In the garden ! Please , sir , I beg you ! ( SHOUTING IN JAPANESE ) Commander , is he to be permitted to take his own life ? Kamiyama is without shame . He dies like a traitor . ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) Hi ! Pentagon called . Operation 's on . Hop on . What am I supposed to tell the charter ? That you 're meditating and can 't fly today ? Jo , the Pentagon only understands about three words and " No " is not one of them . Anyway , I like this meditation stuff . Makes me sound profound . Well , yeah ... No ... Why can 't I fly this one with Mike ? Believe me , you don 't want anything to do with this one . It 's potentially suicidal . Ha ! In that case , maybe Jo can take my place . Ah , no ! You 're expendable , Mike . Hop on . MIKE : See you , Jo ! It 's a hell of a way to run a business . ( MIKE WHOOPING ) I understood this was agreed to . I 'm sorry , Mr. Yahara . There 's nothing I can do about it . You assured me , Miss Santini . You said this man , Hawke , will take us himself . Now , look , the camera 's mounted , the chopper 's ready , and I 'm a very competent pilot . But if that 's not good enough , please feel free to return another day . I mean no offense . Of course , you will take us . Okay . Do you have any idea what they 're testing on us ? Trying to develop something that 'll go through our defense shields , I believe . Two coming in . 42 seconds to impact . SAINT JOHN : Got ' em . Firing on command . At the risk of sounding like a complainer , Saint John , what if these things are armed and they get through our systems , huh ? Okay , fire . There 's your answer . They are and they didn 't . What do you say we take out one of those tanks , huh ? We can 't , they 're on our side . Why doesn 't anyone tell them that ? Two more coming in . SAINT JOHN : Uh-huh . JO : That 's the Cheemunga River down there . You can trigger the camera whenever you 're ready . Just hit the switch . Fly that way , up the river . ( CHUCKLES ) Sorry , that 's restricted airspace . Cheemunga nuclear generating plant 's around the bend . I 'm aware of that , Miss Santini . I wish you to approach it . No way . By the time the FAA got a hold of me , I wouldn 't have a license to walk a dog . If necessary , I am capable of flying this machine myself , you may get out and walk right now , if you prefer . YAHARA : Airspeed , please . Look , Mr. Yahara , what 's this all about ? Your current airspeed , Miss Santini ? 120 . Hold it constant , please . At what point do we enter this restricted airspace ? It 's just ahead . More precisely , Miss Santini . Along the ridge line up there . Look , the minute we 're detected , they 'll be onto me by radio . And if you do not respond , they will send up interceptors from the base here . Right . And we mightn 't have a second warning . How long from first contact to interception ? How the hell am I supposed to know ? I don 't do this run . If you cannot provide me with a reasonable figure , we will have to test it in practice . I 'm not sure . On the outside , five minutes . We are now , what , 10 minutes from the atomic generator plant ? Right , at this speed . OPERATOR ON RADIO : Cheemunga control , to light aircraft , west of the river . Please identify yourself . You 're entering restricted airspace . So what do I do ? Identify yourself correctly and apologize for the violation . You strayed off course . And then turn around , Miss Santini . Where to ? Wherever I tell you . Cheemunga control , Cheemunga control . This is November 20044 , Charlie . Leaving this sector . Sorry for the intrusion . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) I don 't like this . She should have been back hours ago . Did you try the radio ? Yeah . Checked with the local ATC . All they could tell me was she filed a low level plan for the Cheemunga area . Yeah , well , that 's nothing unusual . Yeah . Look , I 'm going hunting , why don 't you ... I 'll hold down the fort and check out her charter . Right . Good man . Okay . SAINT JOHN ON RADIO : Lady to Base , are you there , Mike ? All yours . Any luck ? I 've located the chopper , but there 's no sign of Jo anywhere in the area . The tanks are half full . It doesn 't make any sense . Did you check out that charter she had ? Yeah . Takeshi Yahara . I called his office . Seems Jo dropped him off here , mid-afternoon , he paid her and left . All right , I 'm gonna make another sweep of the area and I 'll come on home . Stick near the radio , just in case . MIKE : Roger . JO : They 're friends . That 's all , just friends . An active Air Force Major , and what I suspect to be a government agent ? Odd friends , wouldn 't you say , Miss Santini ? I don 't give a damn what you think . Why am I here ? What do you want from me ? To be frank , I have no interest in you personally . Please keep that in mind . If you give us trouble , I will have you killed . She strayed into a high security zone ? Yeah and they want a complete written explanation as to what a Santini chopper was doing there . What the hell is going on ? Jo knows better than that . I don 't know . ( SIGHS ) And she was up with this Yahara character ? Yeah , I asked Jason to run a check on him . And ? And he 's a Japanese businessman . He set up shop here a couple of months ago . Well , internationally , his record 's so clean , he could qualify for Pope . And he said Jo took him up in this charter and that 's it ? Yeah . Why , he had nothing but praise for Santini Air . What time was this violation ? That 's the one thing . It was around the same time , 12 : 38 in the afternoon . Uh-huh . I think I 'm gonna pay this Yahara a call . Want me to come with you ? No , you better go pick up the chopper before somebody else does . You sure about that ? In case he doesn 't qualify for Pope . Yes . Can I help you ? I 'm looking for a Mr. Takeshi Yahara . I am he . My name is Saint John Hawke , Mr. Yahara . I 'm with Santini Air . Hawke . Mr. Hawke . One of our pilots , a Miss Santini , has disappeared . How distressing . She ... She violated restricted airspace . Cheemunga . Yes . Please don 't hold her responsible . She was acting under my instructions . Mr. Yahara ... Do you recognize anyone in this photograph ? The circled one . Is he familiar ? That 's my father , what 's going on here ? Navy Lieutenant Allan B. Hawke , Acting Flight Leader . To be more specific about time and place , the carrier Saratoga , Iwo Jima , 1945 . Died , coronary thrombosis . Five years ago . Am I correct ? That 's enough games , Yahara . What 's going on here ? I cannot tell you how sorry I am , that your father is , shall we say , out of my reach . If you must know , Miss Santini is my prisoner . Hand me that phone . Death is an effective threat only to those who fear it , Mr. Hawke . If you wish to see Miss Santini again put the gun on the desk . ( LOUDLY ) Know where I can find Mr. Yahara ? ( CHUCKLING ) That expression doesn 't look encouraging . I 've tried crosschecks , the Japanese Red Brigade , the Yakuza and the Tokyo mobs . Takeshi Yahara is spotless . He 's as clean as a whistle . Oh , come on , Jason . There 's gotta be something there . Well , if you want to get down and dirty , he did fight for the Japanese Imperial Army in the Second World War . You wanna make something out of that ? Well , it 's a start . Terrific , go ahead . Rank ? I don 't believe you . Come on , give me the rank . Rank , all right . Uh , First Lieutenant . Branch of service ? Hang on , it 's here . 1943 , Army pilot , 31st Squadron fighter . Volunteered March 1945 for a Special Attack Corps . Shot down , POW for eight months . Released ... Etcetera , etcetera , etcetera . Are you sure ? Special Attack Corps ? It 's right here . So what ? You should read some history sometime , Jason . Rivers , Saint John and Jo have just vanished into thin air . The Special Attack Corps was also known as the Divine Wind . Kamikaze ? At least , your Japanese is better than your history . How did a kamikaze pilot end up as a POW ? Begs the question , doesn 't it ? Hey , all the POWs were interrogated prior to internment . You got someone who could dig out the records ? Well , if we don 't I 'll invent somebody . What are we looking for here ? Anything that can tell us who Yahara is and what the hell he is up to . Right . He asked a couple of questions about Mike and Jason . But I have a feeling , it 's got something to do with the Cheemunga Nuclear Plant . And the Second World War . The what ? How are you doing ? My criminal talents aren 't what they could ... Here . I trust you both have been spending your time fruitfully . Do you know fear , Mr. Hawke ? Do you know what it feels like ? I think so . That is the question your father asked me when I was captured . He could not understand the mind of a kamikaze warrior . Yeah , well , he probably wasn 't alone in that . The proper use of the katana is an ancient and venerable art . It 's very educational , Yahara . For example . If you will sit well away , Miss Santini . Thank you . A blow to the top of the skull is delivered with a snap of the wrist at the moment of contact . The blade does not penetrate . It merely touches with immense force and cracks the skull like a walnut . I ask you again , Mr. Hawke . Do you know fear ? Real fear ! ( JO SCREAMS ) ( JO PANTING ) An-san , we have word the plane has arrived . Excellent . We will leave now . Be patient . Your waiting will soon be over . ( DOOR CLOSING ) Yeah , could you check that through your other branches ? That would be appreciated , thanks . Mike . Yeah . This is Ibo Tanabe . Ibo , Major Mike Rivers . How are you ? Well , Yahara 's company is a front . There is no registration of it in or out of state . What 'd you find ? Motive . You were dead right about history . Ibo is one of our leading Asian experts . He discovered these gems . Well , let 's hear it . Go ahead , Ibo . Spring , 1945 . Lieutenant Takeshi Yahara and a kamikaze squadron broke through the fighter net around the US fleet off Iwo Jima . He was going for the Saratoga when a Hellcat pilot put him in the sea . He was pulled out alive . That 's a miracle . Here 's another . The Hellcat pilot was Lieutenant Allan B. Hawke . Saint John 's father . Revenge ? After all these years , that guy is nuts . It is a bit difficult for Westerners to understand , Major Rivers . But among followers of the ancient ways , such things are not unusual . Haji in Japanese , shame inflicted upon one , if you like . The truly devoted might wait years to avenge the lost honor . And Saint John 's death would do that , huh ? My guess is there 's more to it than that . IBO : Yahara was to die that day . His avowed mission was to destroy the carrier Saratoga . His shame was in failing . A single life is rarely a sufficient recompense for such things . Oh , no , the Cheemunga Power Plant . Jo was reported in the security zone before she disappeared . Is there any chance that he might try such a strike , Mr. Tanabe ? It 's very possible , I 'm afraid . The question is , how ? Let me see it . Hayashi , leave me alone for a while . The time has come . ( AIRCRAFT FLYING ) There they are . Well , that should fix it . They got orders to shoot anything that comes close to the Cheemunga zone . Round the clock till further notice . I would have been happy to oblige you with Airwolf . No , we 'll put it to work looking for Saint John and Jo . If Yahara was intending on hitting Cheemunga , he must be based close by . You know , we can always run Airwolf . LOCKE : This can 't be for real . If that is who I think it is , he 's got some nerve . Takeshi Yahara ? First Lieutenant Yahara , Takeshi . I presume , Mr. Locke , you are responsible for the fighter screen at Cheemunga . LOCKE : That 's correct , Yahara . And now you 're gonna answer some of my questions . LOCKE : Who is that ? Jason . All right , let 's go over and collect your friends . It will be the other way around , I think . Cut the crap , Yahara . Move ! Or I 'll drop you right here . Ask yourself a serious question , Mr. Locke . To come here like this , either I am mad or in complete control of the situation . Do I strike you as mad ? Where are Saint John and Jo ? Alive . That , however , will not be the case if a call is not made from the telephone in that car in a very few minutes . And you 'll die first . That is of no consequence to me . You must know that . Pull the trigger , Mr. Locke , or give me the gun . My men will take you to your friends . I will join you shortly . Got any bright ideas ? No . This guy scares the hell out of me . You yourself admitted , Mr. Locke , to authorizing the fighter screen . Therefore , you can withdraw it . Give him the phone . Do it . Go to hell . Very well . You will please observe how delicate the human skull is . Hey , relax , take it easy . You will be next , Major . You will remain a witness until the end , Mr. Locke . Hold it ! I 'll make the call . Tell them the emergency is over and the proper authorization code , please . No tricks . LOCKE : Flight 309 , abort your mission and return to base . ( ALL TOASTING IN JAPANESE ) ( TOASTING IN JAPANESE ) A traditional kamikaze farewell . If he plows into that power plant , what 'll it do ? I have a camera mounted on the plane . You 'll witness it here , on the monitor , until impact . Mr. Hawke will be spared the sight . I 'm having you executed as I take off . Take him outside . Enjoy the show . Many years ago in another plane , I expected to die . And all the years , since that day , have been one long dream from dive to impact . Today that dream will come to an end . I will find the glory and honor that I swore to then . But you will die before me , Hawke . In shame and dishonor . In gratitude for your service , I give you back the lives that you committed to me . Do this and go . Farewell , Hawke . ( GRUNTING ) I trust you are receiving me ? We gotta alert the base . YAHARA : Even if you got free now , Mr. Locke , the telephone lines have been cut . You could not reach them in time . Do not mourn the loss of your friend . There is only innocence in death . And the resolve to die ! Five miles to target , my friends . That 's impossible . Who the hell is flying that thing ? What is this ? Yahara , you 've got 10 seconds to reverse your course . It 's Saint John . I see my men have betrayed me . No , Yahara . They were true to the end . I will have to finish this myself . Goodbye , Mr. Hawke . I believe that was your last missile , Yahara . Wrong , Hawke . I 'm flying the last one . At this range , even if you hit me , the explosion will finish us both . I wouldn 't count on it , Yahara . Oh , God ! Could Airwolf survive at that range ? Hang tight , guys , I 'm on my way . Now , you gotta see this trick . Now this is great . Mmm-hmm . Give me your hand . You gotta remember this saved my life . Oh , me , too . You never know when this could come in handy . I hate this . Now what ? Do you have a hairpin ? Yeah . Great . Aha ! Aha ! Great . Could you just hurry it up a little ? I adore Mike , but ... This is getting a little kinky . SAINT JOHN : Just one little twist and ... You 'll be free as a bird . Great . Even Houdini had days like this . Yeah , and where is he now ? Saint John ... Hey , Saint John . Yeah ? Do you want me to show you how it 's done ? Here . Thank you . ( HUMMING ) ( JO CLEARS THROAT ) ( SCOFFS ) LOCKE : You 'll be out in a jiffy . JO : Mmm-hmm ? Hawke 'd been out in a jiffy , you know . And one for you . Thanks , Jason . Great . You 're welcome . How did you do that ? It 's a trick my father taught me . All right , let me see that again . Okay , give me your wrist . Lock that like that . Here , sit over here . Sit down here and we 'll lock you to this . Right here . Yeah . And just keep working the lock . Yeah ... That 's what I was doing before . It 's not working . I don 't know what made me think I could do this in the first place . Guess I lost my head . Look , Jason , I 'm gonna have to have the key , I can 't get out . Jason ... Jason ! Locke ! Locke , I 'm not kidding , don 't leave me ! Locke ! Guys , come on , guys ! Don 't do this to me ! I 'll buy your first round . Aha ! ( INAUDIBLE )

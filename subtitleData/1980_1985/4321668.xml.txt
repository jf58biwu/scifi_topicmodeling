 ( WHIRRING ) Not bad , hotshot . Thanks . One thing , though . What ? What do you got against trucks ? It was in my parking spot . Uh-huh . What do you do if they 're double parked ? Take us around again . Airwolf , do you read me ? SAINT JOHN : Loud and clear , Locke . I just had a call from your friend at Devil 's Ridge . We 're coming in . The Company 's put her on code yellow , so we better move quickly on this one . Maybe you should get Disraeli out of there this time . You want to try ? Have a good trip . Ah , won 't be needing it . It 's time we got her out of there . You know what she 's going to say to that . I know she was one of the Company 's best before the East Bank jihad got to her , but maybe she 's ... Go ahead . Say it . Past repair ? Look , what happens when she has a bad dream and we 're not there to pick up the pieces ? Aw , hell , Hector , you 're better off getting yourself an education . ( CHILDREN CHATTERING ) CHARLIE : Two beers , I make the six ball in the corner . Three beers . Five off the four to the side pocket . I 'll give you one beer if you sweep the place out tonight , Charlie . ( LAUGHS ) I need to talk to you . Make that four . Tricky shot . You gave me this for a reason , didn 't you ? You get away from me . Now , come on , come on . Man 's got a right to play a game of pool without you badgering him . Now , come on . ( SIGHS ) Look , I know you 've been outside my place . You 've seen those things , too . I hear you were trespassing , Ms. Grant , and , I don 't know , maybe we ought to just lock you up , throw away the key . Mind your own damn business , Strafe . Look , what did you see ? Tell me . Everybody sees something when they get drunk . Don 't give me that ! You 're just afraid , aren 't you ? Because it 's real . I 'd like to talk to you , Ms. Grant . Okay . Then let 's talk about what 's happening in the Indian burial ground . CHARLIE : Good luck . Strafe , you 've flown over this Blue Clay property with Nick Bronson . Is there anything going on out there ? No . I never seen anything except old Indian bones and they don 't light up . Make noise . Lest you 're an Indian that 's full of beer . Or a little gal that 's full of imagination . Boo ! I told you the mining company was gonna file a trespassing complaint against you . We 'll have to see the judge . Don 't touch me . Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa , whoa , Lorrie , it 's me . Saint John ! Well , I should 've guessed you wouldn 't be far behind . She starts ranting and you show up to bail her out . This is getting to be quite a pattern . Can I take her home now ? Let 's go . Talk to you later , Locke . Okay . Lorrie ! Locke talked to the Company . We can stay for a while . Hi , Lorrie . Phone him back , Mike . I don 't need you guys . Unless this is a social visit . We 're just here to see how you 're doing . ( EXCLAIMS ) But I know what you 're thinking . " Poor Disraeli . " Her mind 's so blown we 'll never fit the pieces back together . " Lorrie , please . Yeah , bring her in . Seal her file so the Company ... Sorry , kiddo , we just don 't need to advertise . Come on . Sheriff . I 'd like you to meet Mr. Nokomo . Pleasure . He 's checking out the area . Thinking about buying the old Blue Clay . Well , that mine 's still got lots of silver in her . The area looks promising . Sure would give this place a boost , opening up the mine again . Oh , my car . I 'll drive it back . Okay , maybe I made a mistake . Talking about the Company back there . It 's done . Forget it . Forget what ? That you come out here every couple of weeks to wet nurse me ? That the Company put me out to pasture ? Not pasture , R and R. Bull . You know the policy . Sure . Don 't make waves if you want to make it back in the ranks . You 'll make it back . Just take it easy and let us help you . I don 't need help . Okay , I do need help , but not the kind you think . Talk to me . Like the old days ? Except now you only come to see me when I 'm in trouble . Oh . I miss the old days . Wipe your feet , please . Rustic . Here , let me do that . It 's okay , I 'm used to it . ( SIGHS ) Look , I know what you 're thinking . But I 'm not seeing agents jumping out of every tree this time . But there are things that I don 't understand . What things ? Noises , lights , in the old Indian burial ground . And animals . Huge animals . Look , I swear I 'm not drinking and I 'm not drugged out ! So what is going on , Lorrie ? Okay , a few weeks ago , I asked Charlie Rising Moon to show me some of the rock drawings in the old burial ground . He used to do the odd job around here . And then these things started to happen . Look , ask him . Give him this and ask him what he 's seen out there . Take it . You heard her . Take it . Charlie Rising Moon ? Could be . Lorrie asked us to give you this . She 's a crazy woman . She said that you put that around her neck . It 's good medicine to protect a man from bad spirits . Like the ones behind her house ? She lives on sacred ground . She should leave . The spirits will destroy her ! ( HOWLING ) ( RATTLING ) ( CLINKING ) Saint John ? Mike ? ( HOWLING ) ( SCREAMS ) ( GUN FIRING ) ( SCREAMS ) ( CHANTING ) You 're in on this . ( WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA ) Chalk up another one for the loony bin team . How 're you feeling ? Like a prisoner . Lorrie ! No broken bones . Head 's still screwed on , no matter what you 're thinking . Rising Moon , he was there . Did you see him ? Not since yesterday , and he hasn 't bent over backwards to help us anyway . But you must have seen something . Animal tracks ? Look , I 'm not making it up . You 've got to believe me . Lorrie , we 're doing the best we can , but there 's not a whole lot to go on . Don 't say it . Don 't . You promised me , Saint John . No more psychiatrists . You promised . It 's real . It 's real . ( CAMERA CLICKING ) All I see is trees . I don 't know what else to look for . One more pass over the mine . Look , the Company 's going to insist we draw the line somewhere . Where do you draw the line when it involves a life , Mike ? She was the best one on that team . It took her over a year to work her way into that terrorist group . One Company slip-up and everything went sour . She went through five days of hell to get me out of there alive . The Company owes her . I owe her . You brought her back , man . Did I ? There , ten o 'clock . Just a reflection . Snap a roll anyway . Jo , we 're gonna have to get settled on that ... ( PHONE RINGING ) Can you get that ? Santini Air . We took her car , so she borrowed one . The sheriff put her in jail . Damn . Bring her home , Saint John . We can 't afford to mess up . There may be something to what she 's saying . LOCKE : Listen , if the Company nails me , I 'm gonna share my bruises with you . I 'll give the sheriff your regards . I can already see the strings being pulled . But this is the last time , mister . Devil 's Ridge is a growing town and we really don 't need any mental cases scaring off the investors . Next time , I 'll get her committed . How long do I have to pack ? We can 't leave until our film is developed . What film ? Landscapes . You guys are the crazy ones . Bucking the Company for me ? Thanks . Okay , well , when I was in the sanitarium , they gave me a lump of clay and they told me to beat on it , instead of myself . I ended up making a pot that leaked . I want back in the Company , Mike . Whatever it takes . You see , it 's real , it 's real ! Mike ? Lorrie ? Mike ? Lorrie ? ( YELLS ) Where are they ? I don 't know . Tell me what happened . Something took them . Where ? Back to the sacred lands . Take me there . If I take a white man there , my ancestors will kill me . If you don 't , you 're gonna join your ancestors . It took a small hurricane to cause this mess . Ghost winds . Call it what you want , they had to go somewhere . From out of the earth . Demons . Maybe . Or from out of the sky . Either way we die . Charlie , I know you have your religion and I respect it , but give me this much . They may still be alive . Now , if there 's any chance of getting them back , I have to try . And I need your help . You may wander around for days . Charlie , the Blue Clay mine . Take me there . You take the jeep . Isn 't there a shorter way ? Yeah , come on . ( WHIRRING ) Haven 't we done enough test runs on ... Shut up , Bronson . We 've got a problem . Damn right we do . People are starting to ask questions . You can 't expect the Indians to believe all that stuff about ... It 's not the Indians . That Grant woman ? She had a friend with her . This was supposed to be so simple . It will be . You just have that buyer here first light . I 'll take care of the woman . Didn 't he tell you anything else when he called ? Like what ? Like where he was when Mike and Lorrie disappeared . He wasn 't in the mood for talking , Locke . You know , this wouldn 't have happened if I would 've taken care of Disraeli months ago . Placed her somewhere where she would 've got continuous care . Okay , so she 's an emotional risk . Since when were the rest of us perfect ? Spirits are angry , gate 's locked . Tunnels to the main building . They mean business . So do I. Go on , get out of here . You think they 've got them in there ? Yeah . You know , I 've always wanted to be on the side of the cavalry . Just once . Just don 't call yourself Custer , okay ? Let 's go . All right , time 's running out , folks . I need to know . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Scorpion . Who else might come looking for it ? Nobody . So you got yourself a fancy helicopter . So what ? Get your kicks out of scaring ladies and Indians , is that it , Strafe ? Shut up ! Leave her alone . Where is your boyfriend ? Mr. Nokomo wants to test run this ... What the hell 's going on here ? Your little creep pal is just getting his jollies . Shut up ! Who are these people ? Just a little problem I ran into . I don 't have time for your personal problems . I came here to buy what you say is an experimental American helicopter . Yeah , you 'll never get it out of the country ! How many other people know it is here ? Nobody , I swear . Only Strafe and me . And her friend . The one I saw on the street ? Get rid of them . The Scorpion . There 's your ghost wind . You know this thing ? Experimental helicopter . It 's had two predecessors , but this one 's supposed to be the ultimate machine . Went down a couple months ago . The government 's been searching for it ever since . Let 's go . Hey , what difference does it make ? I mean , we get the money , he gets the chopper and then we get out of here . When the KGB supplied the parts for the Scorpion , they did not expect the American government to find out we had it . My country has plans for the Scorpion . They paid you well . Get the Scorpion ready . I 'll take care of these two . Bronson , you stay here . What are you going to do ? NOKOMO : What we do with spies in my country . Unless of course , you wish to do the honors ? NOKOMO : No ? NOKOMO : Pity . ( GRUNTS ) ( YELLING ) It 's a chopper like the Wolf , but a lot more machinery . I know . Are you all right ? Yeah , fine . Come on . Let 's get out of here . Sitting ducks . You reading anything ? Thermal doesn 't pick anyone up at Disraeli 's . Don 't move . Stay in the rocks . How you doing ? Okay , now that I know I have a few marbles left . I can hear them rattling . Take it easy . Are you all right ? I don 't believe this . You catching this ? I 'm running it through the system . And I got the feeling we 're the old model . You can 't outmaneuver me . You can 't outrun me . I 've got you . ( LAUGHING ) They 're firing heat seekers . Give me a sunburst . There they are . Let 's try a pick up . We 're on their tail , closing fast . Let 's go in after them . That 's easy for you to say . He 's hurting real bad . My punishment for not listening to my ancestors . Go on . Abandon a fellow cavalry man ? Not a chance . I 'll catch up to you later . All right , baby . What you can do . We 're hit . We 've only got one chance . ( ALARMS BLARING ) The fuel intake ? Locke , we 'd have to go nose to nose and there 's no guarantee that he 's vulnerable there . I got an idea . Well , make it a fast one . He can blow us out of the sky . Well , he 'll have to catch us first . He 's close enough to be our shadow . Yeah , it 's perfect . I hope . Rockets ! Let 's do it . According to the cowboy we left at the Blue Clay , Bronson and Connors salvaged the Scorpion after it crashed , hid it , then put it out to the highest bidder . The Scorpion may have been the third version of Airwolf , but the first one is the best . Still , the government lost one hell of a machine there . Yeah , but we got a hell of an agent back . Is he telling me that we can work together again ? I always did try to rush things , huh ? Hi . Hey , how you doing ? Where 's the Wolf ? We put her to bed . She 's on the mend , just like you . They 'd just as soon you forgot about her . For a while there I thought we were all gonna go meet your ancestors . Me , too , but then I thought , maybe they don 't allow the cavalry where they are .

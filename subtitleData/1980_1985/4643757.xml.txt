 [ Wind howling ] [ Buzzing ] Replacement team 's here , sir . Right . Come on through ! We were gonna start looking for you guys . God , it 's really something out there . [ Man ] You look a mess , sir . Yeah ? Your turn next , Ginsberg . OK , bye . See you in 24 . See you tomorrow . What were you saying ? I used to hear her chant all night long ... [ repeating chant ] Over the plants ? She 'd cup her hands over the seeds and chant by the hour . She grew the most beautiful wandoos you ever saw . Primo stuff . Resin city . [ Keypad beeping ] [ Man over PA ] Stand clear . [ Beeping ] Your mother 's been very worried . Roads must be a bear . - What roads ? - Visibility . Visibility , bullshit . You haven 't been on time for the last six months . I wrote you up in the log book . Yeah , you 're a prince . - Good night , gentlemen . - [ Door beeping ] So it was like sinsemillia , right ? Sinsemillia . This grass made Thai stick taste like oregano . Lay you out flat , man . [ Beeping ] - Got a red light , sir . - [ Man ] What on ? Number eight , warhead alarm . Give it a thump .

Launch . - We are at launch , turn your key ! - I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . Turn your key , sir ! [ Horn blaring ] [ Helicopter approaching ] [ Woman ] Go ahead , open it up . Hello , I 'm Pat Healy . I 'm Lyle Watson , this is Arthur Cabot . [ Pat laughs ] I 'm Dr. McKittrick 's assistant . We 've got some passes for you . We 've scheduled a meeting on your arrival . If you have any questions , feel free to ask me , I 'd be happy to fill you in . [ Alarm bell ringing ] - [ Computers beeping ] - [ Indistinct chatter ] - [ Tone sounds ] - [ Rapid beeping ] They 're here . Good . Let 's go . Cabot and Watson came alone . No senators , no congressmen . - I wish they 'd brought senators . - What ? To tell them what goes on . John , please , don 't start that right away . I had them on the phone , they 're calm . Look now , are we positive that these men had no way of knowing this was only a test ? Lyle , how many times are we gonna go through this ? It doesn 't matter . I 've spoken to each of these men . They all thought it was the real deal . We have to be on a plane in less than an hour . I have to explain to the president why 22 percent of his missile commanders failed to launch their missiles . What am I supposed to tell him , 22 percent isn 't so bad ? The president knows that I am fully responsible for the men in my command . I 've ordered a revaluation of our psychological screening procedure . Wait a minute . Excuse me , general . We can 't ask these men to go back to the president with a lot of head-shrinker horseshit ! You can 't screen out human response . Those men know what it means to turn the keys and some are not up to it ! Now , it 's as simple as that ! We ought to take the men out of the loop . - Mr. McKittrick , you 're out of line . - Why ? - Wait . Excuse me . - [ John ] What are you talking about ? I 'm sorry . What do you mean , take them out of the loop ? Gentlemen , we 've had men in these silos since before any of you were watching Howdy Doody . [ Chuckles ] For myself , I sleep well at night , knowing those boys are down there . General , we all know they 're fine men . But in a nuclear war , we can 't have our missiles lying in those silos because they refuse to turn the keys when the computers tell them to ! You mean , when the president orders them to . The president probably follows the computer war plan . That 's a fact ! Well , I imagine the joint chiefs will have some input . You 're damned tooting . Well , the Soviets launch a surprise attack , there 's no time . [ Pat ] Twenty-three minutes from warning to impact . Six minutes , if sub-launched . Six minutes , that 's barely enough time for the president to make a decision . Once he makes that decision , the computer takes over . I know that you 've got a plane waiting , but if you give me five minutes , I 'll show you something . These computers give us access to the world . Troop movements , Soviet missile tests , shifting weather patterns . It all flows into this room and then into what we call the WOPR computer . WOPR , what is that ? The War Operation Plan Response . This is Mr. Richter . Paul , would you tell these gentlemen about the WOPR ? [ Clears throat ] Well , the WOPR spends all its time thinking about World War III . Twenty-four hours a day , 365 days a year , it plays an endless series of war games using all available information on the state of the world . The WOPR has already fought World War III as a game time and time again . It estimates Soviet responses to our responses , to their responses and so on . Estimates damage , counts the dead , and looks for ways to improve the score . But the point is that the key decisions of every conceivable option in a nuclear crisis have been made by the WOPR . You 're saying that this trillion dollar hardware is at the mercy of those men with the brass keys . [ John ] That 's exactly right . Whose only problem is that they 're human . But in 30 days we could replace them with electronic relays . Get the men out of the loop . [ General ] Gentlemen I wouldn 't trust this pile of microchips any further than I could throw it . I don 't trust the safety of our country to some silicon diode . General , nobody is talking about entrusting the safety of the nation to a machine , for God 's sake . We 'll keep control , but we 'll keep it here at the top . Gentlemen ... I 'll recommend McKittrick 's idea to the president . And I 'll get back to you on this . Thank you . You won 't regret this . [ Ship horn blares ] [ â™ª The Beepers : " Video Fever " ] [ Video game sound effects ] [ Sound effects continue ] OK , you had fries and a Coke , right ? [ Video game explosion ] - Damn ! - [ Video game music plays ] - Hi , David . - [ David ] Hey , Howie . - How 's it going ? - Pretty good . - You wanna take this over ? I gotta go . - Sure . - All right . - Thanks . - Bye , David . - Bye ! All right . Question number two . Seeds that are germinated in water before they are planted will what ? Roderick . - [ Boy ] Sprout roots ? - [ Teacher ] David ! Nice of you to join us . I have a little present for you up here . Question number four . In science , innovative concepts occasionally arise from sudden left-field inspiration . Miss Mack tell us your answer to question four . Why do nitrogen nodules cling to the roots of plants ? Um ... Love ? [ Laughter ] Jennifer , what do you know about nitrogen nodules that we don 't ? Some bit of salacious info to which you alone are privy ? [ Laughter ] - No . - [ Teacher ] I see . No , you didn 't know the correct answer , symbiosis , because you don 't pay attention in class . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . There seems to be a lot of confusion on this next question : " Asexual reproduction . " Could someone tell me , please , who first suggested the idea of reproduction without sex ? [ Chuckles , whispers ] [ Laughter ] Miss Mack ! - Yes ? - What is so amusing ? [ Laughs ] What ? All right , Lightman . Could you tell us who first suggested the idea of reproduction without sex ? Um ... - Your wife ? - [ Laughter ] Get out , Lightman . Get out . [ School bell rings ] Mr. Ligget wants me to discuss my attitude problem with Mr. Kessler . Mr. Kessler 's tired of discussing your attitude problem . Me too . [ Buzzer sounds ] Lightman . What a surprise . Won 't you come in ? - Hi . [ laughs ] - Whoa ! Hi . Sorry if I got you in trouble . I couldn 't stop laughing . That 's OK . You were perfect . - I was ? - Yeah . You want a ride home ? Yeah . Hop on . - [ David ] Whoa ! - [ Jennifer laughs ] - You got an F on that test today too ? - Yep . We 're gonna be stuck in summer school . - Not me . - Why not ? You have to make up biology . I don 't think so . Why not ? Why not ? Come on , tell me . Make a left . - Come up to my house and I 'll show you . - What are you gonna show me ? - I 'll show you how to do it . - [ Dog barks ] - Hi , Bo . - Oh , hi , Bo !

I don 't think that I deserved an F. Do you ? You can 't do that ! Already done . - Do you have a middle initial ? - " K , " Katherine . These are my grades . How can anybody get a D in Home Ec ? None of your business . - Can you erase this , please ? - It 's too late . - What are you doing ? - Changing your grade . I don 't want you to do that . [ David ] Nobody can find out . You got a C ! No need for summer school . - Change it back ! - They can 't ... I said change it back . OK , OK . I guess I better get going . Thanks for the ride . Yeah , OK . Bye . Bye . [ Computer humming ] [ Beeping ] - Get down . - You 've got to see it ! - You had your dinner . - [ Dog whining ] Two bedrooms , a bath and a half , and a bonus room . Don 't forget the garbage .

[ Mother laughing ] [ Mother ] Oh , sure . We can work that out . That is true . You 're gonna have a balloon payment in five years , but the economy will be great then . [ David ] Bo , come here . [ Mother ] He who dances must pay the price , right ? That 's wonderful . I 'll meet you tomorrow at 9 : 30 . Bye . You know , I worry about that kid . Why ? Sometimes I think we 're all gonna get electrocuted . Ha ! - [ Crunches ] - [ Gags ] This corn is raw ! I know . Isn 't it wonderful ? - It 's so crisp . - Of course it 's crisp , it 's raw ! No , it 's terrific . You can just taste the vitamin A and D. It 's great . Could we have pills and cook the corn ? [ Operator ] What city , please ? For Sunnyvale , California . The number for Protovision . Yes . That 's 555-8632 . Thank you . And could you also tell me what other prefixes cover that area ? There 's 399 , 437 , - 767 , 936 . - Thanks .

I 've been thinking about my grade . Can you still change it ? - Oh , I don 't know . - I should 've just let you do it . It might be kind of rough . - Why ? - Why ? They can change the password . Maybe they didn 't . Can 't we try ? - Damn ! - Please ? - OK . - OK . - You owe me a quarter . - Yeah . Sorry you lost your game . [ Beeping ] [ Door opens ] What 's it doing ? It 's dialing numbers . - Don 't touch the keys ! - I 'm not touching the keys . Excuse me . This computer company is coming out with new games in a few months . The programs for them are still in their computer . I told my system to search for other computers in Sunnyvale , California . They answer with a tone that other computers recognize . Hear ? [ Beeping ] You 're calling every number in Sunnyvale ? - Isn 't that expensive ? - There 's ways around that . - You can go to jail for that . - Only if you 're over 18 . Will this take a long time ? I 'd like to get my grade changed . [ Chuckles nervously ] That 's funny , actually , because I already changed it . I told you not to do that . Yeah , I know , but I figured you 'd change your mind . I didn 't want you to flunk . What did I get ? - You got a D. - You gave me a D ? No , you got an A. - I was kidding . - Oh . That 's OK . Here . Let 's see what we have so far . Excuse me . - Did you really give me an A ? - Yeah . - Thanks . - You 're welcome . [ Low beeping ] Hey , you got a bank . Gotta make a note of that .

You wanna go with me ? OK . Uh ... All right . Smoking or nonsmoking ? - Nonsmoking . - Nonsmoking . All right , Miss Mack . You 're confirmed on Pan Am 's flight 114 , leaving Chicago 's O 'Hare Airport at 8 : 15 a.m. On 18 August . Do we need a rental car ? No . We have tickets to Paris ? No , you have a reservation though . - [ Beeping ] - [ Scoffs ] Doesn 't identify itself . Huh ... Try anything . " Connection terminated . " How rude . - I 'll ask it for help . - Can you do that ? On some systems . The more complicated they are , the more they help you . Now what ? " Help games . " - [ Typing ] - [ Beeping ] " Games refers to models , simulations and games having tactical and strategic applications . " - What 's that ? - It 's gotta be them . Turn on the printer . I want to get a printout of this . " List games . " [ Beeping ] [ Chuckles ] Oh , my God . These guys can tell you what that printout means ? Yeah . They probably invented it in the first place . [ Computers humming , clattering ] - Can you wait here ? - Why ? These guys can get a little nervous . Jim . Oh , Lightman . [ Laughs ] Hi , Lightman ! I want you to take a look at this . - What 's that ? - I wanted Jim to see that . Wow ! Where 'd you get this ? I tried to break into Protovision . I wanted to see the new games . - Can I have this ? - Wait , I 'm not through yet . Remember you told me to tell you when you 're acting rudely and insensitively ? You 're doing it now . " Theaterwide biotoxic and chemical warfare . " This isn 't from Protovision . You bet it isn 't . Ask him where it came from . I told you already . Looks military to me . Definitely military , probably classified . If it 's military , why does it have checkers and backgammon ? [ Jim ] Maybe because they teach basic strategy . How do I get into that system ? I want to play those games . [ Man ] You can 't see that stuff ! That system has a data encryption algorithm . You 'll never get in ! I don 't believe that any system is totally secure . - I bet you Jim could get in . - [ Man ] I bet you he couldn 't . You 'll never get in through frontline security , but look for a back door . I can 't believe it ! She 's over there and you tell him about our back door ? Mr. Potato Head ! Back doors are not secrets ! You 're giving away our best tricks . - [ Jim ] They 're not tricks . - What 's a back door ? When I design a system , I put in a simple password that only I know about . Whenever I want to get back in , I can bypass whatever security they 've added on . That 's basically what it is . Yeah ? You really want to get in , find out about the guy who designed the system . Come on , I don 't even know the guy 's name . Boy , are you guys dumb . You 're so dumb . I got this thing figured out all by myself . Oh , yeah , Malvin ? How would you do it ? The first game on the list . Go right through Falken 's Maze . - [ Beeping ] - [ Typing ] [ Buzzer sounds ] [ Beeping ] [ Buzzer sounds ] [ Printer whirring ] [ Buzzer sounds ] [ Dog barking ] [ Doorbell rings ] - [ Dog whining ] - [ Cooing to dog ] Hi ! I 'm Jennifer . - Is David here ? - How do you do ? Yeah . He 's up in his room . Thanks . Have you ever heard of the word " tumulus " ? Tumulus . No , I haven 't . Sorry . Neither have I. [ Knocking on door ] Yeah . Hi ! - Where have you been ? - What ? I haven 't seen you in school . Are you sick ? Oh ... No . I was doing things . You want to sit ? How are you ? No , I 'm gonna get some water , OK ? - What is all that stuff ? - It 's nothing . I was just ... I tried to find out more about the guy who designed those game programs so I could get his secret password . - Why ? - Why ? Because ... What 's so special about playing games with some machine ? Oh , no . No , it 's not just some machine . Here , look at this . This is a tape I got from the library . It 's about this guy named Falken . He was into games , as well as computers . He designed them so that they could play checkers or poker , chess . What 's so great about that ? Oh , no . What he did was great . He designed this computer so that it could learn from its own mistakes . So they 're better the next time they played . The system actually learned how to learn . It could teach itself . If I could just get that damn password , I could play the computer . That 's him . That 's Falken . That 's him ? Wow . He 's amazing looking . Can 't you write to him or call him ? No , he 's dead . - He 's dead ? - Yeah . Here , look . Here 's his obituary . He wasn 't very old . [ David ] No , he was pretty old . He was 41 . Oh , yeah ? Oh , that 's old . [ David ] That 's his little boy . Oh , yeah ? This is really sad . The child and his mother died in a car crash . Yeah , I know . " After the tragic loss of his family , Dr. Falken 's health deteriorated . " My dad is 45 . - Once he was sick , and we thought ... - What was his name ? My father ? No , no . Falken 's kid . Joshua . It can 't be that simple . - [ Typing ] - [ Beeping ] - Wow . - What ? We got something . [ Computer humming ] We 're in ! It thinks I 'm Falken . " Hello . " How can it ask you that ? It 'll ask you what it 's programmed to . - Do you want to hear it talk ? - Yeah . I 'll ask how it feels . " I 'm fine . How are you ? " [ Computer ] Excellent . It 's been a long time . Can you explain the removal of your user account on June 23 , 1973 ? They must have told it he died . " People sometimes make mistakes . " - [ Computer ] Yes , they do . - How can it talk ? It 's not a real voice . This box interprets computer signals into sound . - Shall we play a game ? - Oh ... [ chuckles ] I think it missed him . Yeah . Weird , isn 't it ? " Love to . How about Global Thermonuclear War ? " [ Computer ] Wouldn 't you prefer a good game of chess ? " Later . Let 's play Global Thermonuclear War . " Fine . All right ! Wow . Which side do you want ? I 'll be the Russians . Please list primary targets . Who should we nuke first ? Oh , let 's see . How about Las Vegas ? Las Vegas . Great ! What next ? - Seattle ! - Yeah ! [ laughs ] [ Beeping ] I have seven ... Correction , eight redbirds two degrees past apogee . [ Alarm blares ] Better get the old man down here . [ Man over PA ] We have a Soviet missile warning . Check for malfunction and report confidence . Projected target areas , NORAD regions 2526 . [ Alarm continues blaring ] All stations , this is Crystal Palace initiating emergency conference . 19 degrees past apogee , with possible 18 targets in track . Estimate reentry at 19-23 Zulu . - What you got here , Joe ? - We have a radar tracking . Eight inbound Soviet ICBMs already over the pole . Estimated impact , 11 minutes . Target area , western United States . Why didn 't we get detection ? I 'm not sure . We 're checking for DSP malfunction . BMEWS has continuous radar tracking on inbounds . Confidence is high . I repeat , confidence is high . [ Alarm continues ] - [ Jennifer ] What is all that ? - [ David ] I don 't know . " Trajectory headings for multiple impact reentry vehicles . " What does that mean ? I don 't know , but it 's great . - Which is the bombs ? - Subs . - Want to blow them up ? - Out of the water . - What 's a " trajectory heading " ? - I have no idea . The president is diverting to Andrews . The vice president is out of position and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs ... Missile warning reports no malfunction . Confidence remains high . Take us to DEFCON 3 . Get on to SAC . - Tell them to flush the bombers . - Yes , sir . [ Buzzer sounds ] SAC , this is Crystal Palace . CINC NORAD has declared DEFCON 3 . Scramble all alert aircraft . I repeat , scramble all alert aircraft . [ Over PA ] Inbounds presently MIRVing . We now have approximately 24 possible targets in track . Time to impact : 8 minutes . SAC is launching the bombers . General Powers is on the line . Beringer . Goddamn it ! We didn 't get a launch detection from our satellite ! No , radar picked them up out of the atmosphere . That 's the first we heard of it . Get the ICBMs in the bullpen warmed up and ready to fly . - Get me the president on the horn . - [ Man ] Yes , sir . [ Dialing ] Mr. President , this is Beringer at NORAD . Oh , attack ! - I wonder if I should use my subs . - Sure . Give them the works . [ Father ] David ! Excuse me . David ! How many times have I said to fasten these lids on tight ? Look at this ! I 'll be down in a few minutes . Now ! I want this cleared up right away ! Come down here and do what your father asks you to . Pronto , David . We 're gonna barbecue tonight . Want to invite your little friend ? - Please . - David . Shit . " Little friend . " [ Man ] Yes , sir . Mr. President , something 's happening here . I 'll get back to you . [ Over PA ] Reconfirmed . What 's happening ? [ Joe ] BMEWS and Cobra Dane now report negative confirmation on all inbound tracking . Get on to SAC . Tell them to hold steady . Stop ! It 's a simulation ! It 's an attack simulation running ! What 's he yelling about ? I didn 't order a simulation . We 're not being attacked ! It 's a simulation ! Whoa , now ! Hold it ! Don 't run . Somebody could get hurt . I 'm sorry . We don 't know how it happened but someone on the outside fed an attack simulation into the main . Conley , take us off full alert . Hold at DEFCON 4 till we find out exactly what in the hell 's happening here ! I didn 't tell you to cut the line ! Did I tell you to ? You cut the line !

[ Laughs ] This is good . I 'm so proud of you ! [ Man on TV ] ... the U.S. Went on a full-scale nuclear alert , believing that the Soviets launched a surprise missile attack . A Pentagon spokesman places blame on a computer malfunction , assuring that the problem has been corrected . For more on the story , let 's go live via satellite to Washington , D.C. - And News 4 's Tim Hilert . - [ Phone rings ] - [ Mother ] Well , that 's your phone . - Yeah . [ laughs nervously ] Seriously , congratulations . This 'll be a pleasure to sign . [ Phone rings ] - Hello ? - [ Jennifer ] David ? Are you watching the news ? Jennifer . Yeah , I 'm watching . Is that us on TV ? Did we do that ? It could be . Oh , Jesus , Jennifer ! What am I gonna do ? They 're gonna come get me . I 'm screwed ! I am screwed ! Wait , no ! Sh ! Calm down , calm down . If they were so smart , they would 've found you already . Yeah . All you have to do is throw the number away and don 't call it again . That 's all . Maybe they didn 't trace the call . Right . Maybe they didn 't . I 'm sure they didn 't trace it . All you have to do is act normal . We 'll both act normal and it 'll be fine . - OK ? - OK . OK . God , this is so unbelievable . Do you think maybe I can tell Michelle ? No , Jennifer , don 't call her ! I 'm sorry . I won 't . I 'll talk to you tomorrow , OK ? OK . Good night , Jennifer .

" Last week I had the governor of New Jersey in this chair . He asked me , " Colonel , why are we at DEFCON 4 as we are right now ? " Why are we at DEFCON 4 ? The Soviets saw our bombers scramble and went on alert . We told them it was just an exercise . We 're waiting for them to relax their posture before we do . Wait , wait . - Give me that . - Another tour group . Just what we need today . - Why don 't they go to Disneyland ? - I think they 're going tomorrow . OK , all set ? Oh , here . [ Paul ] It was a one-in-a-million shot . There was an open line at our division in Sunnyvale . The phone company screwed up ! - John McKittrick , George Wigan . - How are you ? George is with the FBI . He brought the kid in . It looks like we 've got a high school prank on our hands . Paul , what happened ? The kid broke into the war games subsystem using a password left by the original programmer . - Password ? - Yes , sir . None of my team knew it was there . Kid claims he was looking for a toy company . That 's great . Anybody in here buy that one ? We can take out the password , but it 'd help to beef up security around the WOPR . Beef up , huh ? How about screwed up ? We did all that and he broke in again . [ George ] Kid says your computer called him . What the hell is going on , John ? I woke up the president . I told him we were under attack by the Russians . Do you know what kind of idiot that makes me look like ? Or the general ? Wait , general . We 're being naive . There 's no way a high school punk can put a dime in a telephone and break into our system . He 's got to be working with somebody else . He fits the profile perfectly . He 's intelligent , but an underachiever , alienated from his parents , has few friends . Classic case for Soviet recruitment . What does this say about the state of our country ?

[ John ] Come here a minute . - See that sign up here ? Up here ? - Yeah . DEFCON ? That indicates our current defense condition . It should read DEFCON 5 , which means peace . It 's still on 4 because of that little stunt you pulled . Actually , if we hadn 't caught it in time it might have gone to DEFCON 1 . - Do you know what that means ? - No , what ? World War III . Wow . You say you broke into our system just to play a game ? That 's right . That 's exactly right . Mm-hm . [ laughs ] When you saw it on the news , you knew how serious it was . Why 'd you do it again ? I didn 't . I even threw the number away . Yeah , they found it in the trash . Joshua called me . - Hey ! Look at that . That 's some setup . - What 'd you say ? This is some setup . No , no , before that . Joshua called me . [ Scoffs ] Machines don 't call people . Yours did . Who are you going to Paris with ? Pari ... Oh ! No , no , you don 't understand . Now , you had reservations for two to Paris . - Who are you working with ? - Nobody ! Why don 't I believe you ? I shouldn 't say any more until I talk to a lawyer . I think we better forget about a lawyer until I get a few answers out of you myself . [ Phone rings ] [ Continues ringing ] You gonna answer the phone ? Hello . Yeah . What ? All right , I 'll be right down . You stay here . Don 't move . What 's going on ? There 's been a serious penetration into our WOPR execution order file . - What 's he saying ? - Let 's have it in English . I 'll give it to you in English . Somebody got into McKittrick 's system and stole our missile codes . Is that right ? The system won 't accept a launch code unless we 're at DEFCON 1 . I can change those codes in an hour . Who did this ? The kid 's gotta be working with somebody . I sure as hell don 't want our bombers on the ground if anything happens . Take us to DEFCON 3 and get SAC on the line . Where are you ? Sir . Get me an update . I wanna know what those bastards are up to . Yes , sir . [ Buzzer sounds ] [ Computer beeping ] Joshua . [ Joshua ] Greetings , Professor Falken . Hello . Are you still playing the game ? Of course . I should reach DEFCON 1 and launch my missiles in 28 hours . Would you like to see some projected kill ratios ? [ David ] Sixty-nine percent of the housing destroyed . Seventy-two million people dead ? Is this a game or is it real ? - What 's the difference ? - Oh , wow . You are a hard man to reach . Could not find you in Seattle and no terminal is in operation at your classified address . What classified address ? DOD pension files indicate current mailing ad Dr. Robert Hume , a.k.a. Stephen W. Falken . 5 Tall Cedar Road , Goose Island , Oregon , 97 ... Can I just talk to Mr. McKittrick ? I know what 's ... Ah ! Can I talk to McKittrick ? I 'll be escorting you to federal authorities in Denver where you 'll be under arrest pending indictment for espionage . No , wait a minute . He 's right over there . Get that bastard out of the war room ! No ! It 's Joshua ! He 's still playing the game ! He 's gonna start a war ! Hold him where you had him before . We 'll be leaving soon . [ David ] Call Falken ! He 'll tell you . Please call him . Please call him ! Call him ! What the hell 's he doing in here anyway ? Some of the men say you 're quite a tennis player . [ Woman laughing ] [ Recorder ] Patient 's eyes are dilated , consistent with use of marijuana and possibly PCP . Depending on what information you want , you press a button . Well , let 's say I wanted to find out how to hit a backhand . [ Laughs ] I don 't think I have the right program . - [ Knocking on door ] - Excuse me . What do you want ? [ David ] Bathroom . It 's a long ride to Denver . [ Keypad beeping ] Please , let me talk to Mr. McKittrick . You 're not talking to anybody . The FBI 's coming soon . - Do you have to take a leak ? - No . [ Soft buzzing ] [ Recording of keypad plays ] [ Door unlocks ] - [ Woman ] I 'm working here . - [ Man ] Oh , I 'm sorry . Stop it ! - You have pretty eyes . - That 's original . - I 'll get the elevator . - Sign in ? - Yeah , get us all . - [ Elevator dings ] - [ Electrical fizzling ] - [ Unlocks ] [ Man ] I heard they voted you Miss Fine in 1979 . Is that true ? [ Woman ] Will you stop it ? - [ Man ] Am I bothering you ? - [ Woman ] Yes . - [ Man ] Do you want me to leave ? - [ Woman ] Yes . [ Elevator dings ] [ Keypad beeping ] I want this door open now . - How about calling ? - Yes , sir . I don 't believe this . [ Man ] Hey , Scooter . Wait up . [ Man 2 ] Come on , hurry it up . I 'm late . [ Man ] OK , I 'll be right with you . I think it 's jammed from inside . David ! You 're just making it harder on yourself . [ Man ] Let 's go . [ Man ] Right this way , folks . I was just told that they 're cleaning the floors in the computer center . Don 't want anyone to slip and fall , so we 'll end the tour here . Now , if I can ask you to board the bus as quickly as possible you 'll have a complimentary beverage waiting at the officer 's center . - Hold it ! What are you doing ? - Ah ! Got it . Here it comes . Do you kids think you own this place ? [ Stammers ] Oh . I was just looking around . You 're not supposed to leave the group . Yes . - So why don 't you get back there ? - Thank you very much , sir . Get out of the way . Take care . Watch your step . - Bye . - Bye , now . Watch your step . Thank you . Check everywhere . He can 't be far . Let 's move . [ Computer humming ] [ Beeping ] - [ David ] Thanks , pal . - [ Man ] Take care . [ Static , dial tone ] One five ... [ murmurs numbers ] [ Operator ] What city , please ? Goose Island , Oregon . The number for Dr. Robert Hume , H-U-M-E , on Tall Cedar Road . Checking under Dr. Robert Hume , H-U-M-E , on Tall Cedar Road . I find no listing . What does that mean ? He doesn 't have a phone ? I 'm sorry . I have no listing . Oh , wait . Uh ... Falken . Dr. Stephen Falken , F-A-L-K-E-N , at the same address . I find no listing for Dr. Stephen Falken , F-A-L-K-E-N , on Tall Cedar Road , Goose Island . Thank you . [ Phone rings ] Yeah ? Jennifer , it 's me , David . - David ? ! - Yeah , uh ... Listen , I 'm in Colorado and I need a really big favor . - Can you lend me some money ? - What ? I need an airline ticket . I 'll pay you back . I need a ticket from Grand Junction to Salem , Oregon . Why ? What 's going on ? I 'll tell you about it later . What are you doing in Colorado ? I went by your house . Your parents were freaked and there are men from the FBI asking all these questions . I can 't talk about it right now . Listen when you buy the ticket , tell them I 'll pick it up in Grand Junction Airport ? David , what 's happening ? I can 't talk . I gotta get off the phone . But please , will you do this for me ? Punch up number five . Let me see what you have . Twenty-two typhoon-class submarines departing Petropavlovsk , turning southbound at Nordkapp , bearing 095 degrees . Sergeant , I hope you like vodka . Yes , sir . I just hope they don 't make me eat none of them damn fish eggs . Sir , the Soviets are denying any increase in their submarine deployment . They want to know why we 're provoking them . They 're full of shit . We know they 're down there . I 'm gonna blow their ass out of the water . [ Computer humming ] [ Indistinct PA announcement ] Surprise ! Why are you here ? You didn 't sound too good . It 's only a three-hour drive . You shouldn 't have come . I 'm in trouble . Why ? Is this because of what you did with my grade ? [ Ship horn blares ] [ Man ] Better hustle . The ferry 's gonna leave any second . Thanks . Come on , we gotta run . Wait , wait , wait ! Hold it , hold it . [ Ship horn blares ] If he 's alive , why 'd the obituary say he 's dead ? He 's not dead . He left . When they know too much , they get new identities . - Anyway , the computer said so . - Oh , the computer said so . Is that the computer that 's still playing the games ? It 's the military 's computer . Why wouldn 't they know ? They don 't know about Joshua . Falken knows about Joshua . He 's the only one who knows what it can do . The computer is trying to win the game we asked it to play . For real ! You don 't even believe me ! David ... David , David ... He 's not dead . I 'm sorry . I believe you . [ Ship horn blares ] [ Bird chirping ] Oh , shit ! What was that ? [ Jennifer ] I don 't know . Did you see that ? Some people won 't believe they could fly . The sky was once filled with them ! I 'm looking for Dr. Hume . Are you a paleontologist ? I need a paleontologist . No , we 're high school students . Oh ... pity . Well , high school students , you 're on my land and I didn 't invite you . But aren 't you Stephen Falken ? Now , listen carefully . Path . Follow path . Gate . Open gate , through gate , close gate . Last ferry , 6 : 30 , so run , run , run . Wait ! Wait ! I came because of Joshua . [ Computer humming ] [ Beeping rapidly ] Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan air defense zone . Flight profile suggests Soviet backfire bombers . I want a visual confirmation on that . Scramble two F-16s out of Galena . Go to DEFCON 2 . [ Buzzer sounds ] [ Alarm blares ] [ Man over radio ] Crystal Palace , this is Delta Foxtrot 27 . I have negative radar contact . Repeat , negative Soviet aircraft . 27 , this is Brass Hat . They 're right in front of you ! You 're almost on top of them . [ Man over radio ] Brass Hat , we got nothing on radar and 40 miles visibility . There 's nothing out there , general . Just blue skies . What the hell ? [ Beeping ] [ Jennifer ] You really haven 't been listening . [ Falken ] Yes , I have . I loved it when you nuked Las Vegas . Suitably biblical ending for the place , don 't you think ? You gonna tell them what Joshua 's doing ? Children , come over here . I 'm gonna tell you a bedtime story . Are you sitting comfortably ? Then I 'll begin . Once upon a time there lived a magnificent race of animals who dominated the world through age after age . They ran and they swam and they fought and they flew , until suddenly quite recently they disappeared . Nature just gave up and started again . We weren 't even apes then . We were just these smart little rodents hiding in the rocks . And when we go nature will start again with the bees probably . Nature knows when to give up . I 'm not giving up . If Joshua tricks them into launching an attack , it 'll be your fault . My fault ? The whole point was to practice nuclear war without destroying ourselves . To get the computers to learn from mistakes we couldn 't make . Except that I never could get Joshua to learn the most important lesson . What 's that ? Futility . That there 's a time when you should just give up . What kind of lesson is that ? Did you ever play tic-tac-toe ? Yeah . Of course . - But you don 't anymore . - No . Why ? Because it 's a boring game . It 's always a tie . Exactly . There 's no way to win . The game itself is pointless . But back at the war room , they believe you can win a nuclear war that there can be acceptable losses . So you gave up ? Decided to play dead ? For security reasons , they graciously arranged my death . Did you know that no land animal with a body weight of over 50 pounds survived that age ? Extinction is part of the natural order . Bullshit ! If we 're extinguished , it 's not natural . It 's stupid . It 's all right . I 've planned ahead . We 're just three miles from a primary target . A millisecond of brilliant light and we 're vaporized . Much more fortunate than the millions who 'll wander sightless through the smoldering aftermath . We 'll be spared the horror of survival . I 'm only 17 years old . I 'm not ready to die yet . You won 't make a simple phone call ? If the real Joshua were still alive , your Joshua you 'd do it . We might gain a few years , enough for you to have a son and watch him die . But humanity planning its own destruction that , a phone call won 't stop . This is unreal ! You don 't care about death because you 're already dead ! I know a lot about you . I know you weren 't always like this . What 's the last thing you cared about ? [ Ship horn blaring in distance ] You 've missed the last ferry . You 're welcome to stay . You want to sleep on the floor ? Good night . Let 's get out of here . Come on , we 'll find a boat . There 's gotta be a boat . [ Beeping ] Mr. President , we 've got 48 nuclear subs closing on the United States , and we 've got 100,000 Soviet troops massing in East Germany . We 're monitoring their bombers that are on alert . Well , that 's a load of shit ! No , no , sir . Not you . Yes , sir . We 'll be in touch as soon as the information changes . There 's rumors of a new Soviet bomber with stealth capabilities . It can project a false radar image 600 miles from the real aircraft . Christ ! Now they got us chasing shadows . [ Computer humming ] I think I saw one . What kind of asshole lives on an island and doesn 't have a boat ? Maybe we can swim . How far do you think it is ? No , it 's two , three miles , at least . Maybe more . What do you say ? Let 's go for it . - No . - Come on . No . I can 't swim . You can 't swim ? I can 't swim , OK , Wonder Woman ? What kind of asshole grows up in Seattle and doesn 't learn to swim ? I never got around to it , OK ? I always thought there was gonna be plenty of time . Sorry . I wish I didn 't know about any of this . I wish I was like everybody else in the world . And tomorrow it would just be over . There wouldn 't be any time to be sorry about anything . Oh , Jesus . I really wanted to learn how to swim . I swear to God I did . Did I tell you that next week I was gonna be on TV ? - You 're kidding . - No . Just on that aerobics show with some girls from my dance class . A movie star . Yeah . It 's kind of stupid , huh ? Nobody would 've been watching me anyway . I would have . [ Helicopter approaching ] Oh , Jesus ! The bastard turned us in ! It 's all right . Get in ! [ Beeping ] [ Over PA ] We have a launch detection . We have a Soviet launch detection . BMEWS confirmed a massive attack . Missile warning . No malfunction . Confidence is high . - [ Woman ] Is this an exercise ? - [ Man ] This is not an exercise . General , DBS is tracking 300 inbound Soviet ICBMs . Tell me this is one of your simulations , Mr. McKittrick . All right . Flush the bombers , get the subs in launch mode . We are at DEFCON 1 . - [ Over PA ] DEFCON 1 . - [ Buzzer sounds ] [ Beringer ] Look at this . Major Lem , get me a report on the WOPR . Initial attack profile is a full-scale Soviet strike . WOPR is putting our losses at 85 to 95 percent of the strategic forces . What does WOPR recommend ? [ John ] Full-scale retaliatory strike . I need some machine to tell me that ? [ Man ] President 's going to Andrews to Airborne Command . We have to give launch option . [ Beringer ] Is he in touch with the Premier ? Russians are denying everything . We have a Soviet submarine launch detection . Let 's go into a launch mode . Close up the mountain . [ Alarm blaring ] [ Woman ] This is Crystal Palace . We 're closing up the mountain . Hurry . After the gates are closed , nobody gets in or out . Initiate internal power . Generators on and functioning . External power disconnected . Seal off ventilation shafts . Shaft locks sealed . - The gate 's closed . - [ Screaming ] [ David ] Oh , Jesus ! Let 's get out ! - Are you all right ? - Yeah . Run for it . [ Alarm blaring ] Move it ! The gate 's gonna shut . Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Hold the door ! Hold the door ! Hold the goddamn door ! Run ! Come on ! Hurry ! They 're clear ! They 're clear ! [ Man ] All units confirm weapons targeted and ready . Awaiting launch codes . We are in a launch mode . Major Lem , lock out changes . [ Lem ] Roger . Lock out enabled . All right , I 'll call you back . Here ! I don 't know what you think you could do here . John ! Good to see you . I see the wife still picks your ties . What has this kid been telling you ? How far has it gone ? The president 's ready to order a counter-strike . That 's what we 're recommending he do . - It 's a bluff . Call it off . - It 's not a bluff . It 's real . Hello , General Beringer ! Stephen Falken . [ Beringer ] Mr. Falken , you picked a hell of a day for a visit . General , what you see on these screens up here is a fantasy a computer-enhanced hallucination . Those blips are not real missiles . They 're phantoms . Nothing indicates a simulation at all . Everything 's working perfectly . - But does it make sense ? - Does what make sense ? That . Look , I don 't have time for a conversation right now ! General , are you prepared to destroy the enemy ? - You bet ! - Do you think they know that ? I believe we 've made that clear enough . Then don 't . Tell the president to ride out the attack . Sir ? They need a decision . Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation , using so many missiles , bombers and subs so that we 'd have no choice but to totally annihilate them ? One minute and 30 seconds to impact . General , you are listening to a machine . Do the world a favor and don 't act like one . [ Beeping ] [ Woman over PA ] One minute and 20 seconds to impact . Yes , Mr. President . At this time , we cannot positively confirm the inbounds . We have reason to believe they may not exist . Yes , that 's affirmative . Yes , sir . I do too . [ Woman over PA ] One minute to impact . Who 's first , how soon ? Initial impact points in the 43rd bomb wing at Loring , 319th at Grand Forks and Alaskan Air Command at Elmendorf . [ Woman over PA ] 50 seconds to impact . Get me the senior controller at those stations . I want to talk to them . All stations , this is Crystal Palace . Stand by for a message from Brass Hat . Acknowledge . [ Man ] Elmendorf Air Force Base , Operations . Lieutenant Colonel Bowers . [ Man 2 ] 319th Bomb Wing , Operations . Colonel Chase . [ Man 3 ] This is Loring Air Force Base . The senior controller isn 't here right now . That 's all right . Who are you ? Sir , this is Airman Dougherty , sir . This is General Beringer at NORAD . Our current situation is ... Men we are currently tracking about 2400 inbound Soviet warheads . But at the moment , we cannot confirm this . I repeat , we cannot confirm this . Thirty seconds to impact . [ Beringer ] We 're right there with you guys . We 've taken all the steps we can . Stand by to launch missiles at my command . Stay on this channel as long as you can . We 'll be standing by . [ Woman over PA ] Twenty seconds to impact . Ten nine eight seven six five four three two one . Impact . [ Low beeping ] [ Low rapid beeping ] This is Crystal Palace . You still on ? Anyone there ? [ Man ] That 's affirmative , sir . [ Man 2 ] Yeah ! We 're here ! - Christ ! We 're here ! - Boards are showing impact . [ Man 3 ] No , sir . No impact . We 're alive and well . All right ! [ All cheering ] All right ! Recall the bombers ! Stand down the missiles ! [ Rapid beeping ] [ Beeping , buzzer sounds ] Joshua , what are you doing ? COC , I need Dr. McKittrick right away . This is McKittrick . We got a problem . WOPR is not letting me log back on . I can 't get in to stand down the missiles . All right , stand by . [ Buzzer sounds ] Paul , this is McKittrick . - The WOPR 's not letting us back in . - I know . No one can get back on . We 're trying everything . It 's like the password file has been wiped out . Don 't you think I would 've tried that ? [ David ] What are those ? Those are launch codes . What are they for ? Joshua 's finding the right code so he can launch the missiles himself . [ John ] What 's happening ? The random number generators aren 't even running . - Got anything ? - I 'm still looking . I got no idea . It could be coming from anywhere . [ Laughing ] Sir , you better get on the headset . Yeah ? The machine 's locked us out . It 's sending random numbers to the silos . It 's trying to hit the codes to launch the missiles . Just unplug the goddamn thing . - Jesus Christ ! - That won 't work , general . It would interpret a shutdown as the destruction of NORAD . Computers in the silos would carry out their last instructions . They 'd launch . Can 't we disarm the missiles ? Over a thousand of them ? There 's no time . At this rate , it 'll hit the launch codes in 5.3 minutes . Mr. McKittrick ? After very careful consideration , I 've come to the conclusion that your new defense system sucks . I don 't have to take that , you sack of shit ! Oh , I was hoping for something a little better than that from you , a man of your education . [ Man ] It 's the president . Well , what are you gonna tell him ? That I 'm ordering our bombers back to fail-safe . We might have to go through this thing after all . Yes , sir . [ Low humming , beeping ] He 's got one . When he gets 10 , he 'll launch the missiles . Can 't they stop it ? No , they can 't . [ Beeping ] They 've taken out my password ! What are we gonna do ? I don 't know . Do you ? I told you not to start playing games with that thing . It 's games . - Games ! - Try it . John , let 's feed it a tapeworm . - It might smash the system . - The kid get in by the back door ? - We took it out . - Can we invade the deep logic ? We keep hitting a firewall . If it wants to play a game , then play . - Have it list games . - Stephen , for chrissake ! [ Jennifer ] Let him ! He 's played it before . - He can 't do any worse . - [ Pat ] Two numbers . I 'd piss on a spark plug if I thought it 'd do any good . Let the boy in there . List games . " Chess . " [ Buzzer sounds ] Three numbers locked in . " Poker . " [ Buzzer sounds ] [ Man ] The security system 's not gonna let anything through . " Global thermonuclear war . " [ Beeping ] [ Pat ] Four numbers . [ Buzzer sounds ] Stephen , for chrissake , do something . - Come on , kid . Let 's go . - No . Try again . - Put the list back up . - We tried that . - Put it up ! - Yes , put it up . - It 's not on the list ! - What 's not on the list ? It 's gotta be in there . " Tic-tac-toe . " You 're in . - [ Man ] Order to disarm the missiles . - No . No . [ Buzzer sounds ] Five numbers . It 's got half the code . One . - Put X in the center . - I know . - [ Pat ] Six up . - [ Man ] You can 't win that game . I know that . It doesn 't . It hasn 't learned . Can you make it play itself ? Yes . Number of players : Zero . [ Beeping ] Seven ! Come on . Learn , goddamn it ! [ Rapid beeping ] Eight ! [ Paul ] Must be caught in a loop . It 's drawing more power from the rest of the system . [ Pat ] Nine numbers ! [ Rapid beeping ] Ten ! It 's got the code . It 'll launch ! - [ Explosion ] - [ Screams ] [ Man ] Colonel Conley , call SAC for a launch status report . - Get me the president . - Yes , sir . [ Low rumbling ] How you doing ? Our land lines are dead . I 'm trying to break through on satellites . [ Radio feedback ] [ Overlapping indistinct chatter ] What 's it doing ? It 's learning . [ Joshua ] Greetings , Professor Falken . " Hello Joshua . " Strange game . The only winning move is not to play . How about a nice game of chess ? [ Indistinct cheering ] Colonel Conley take us to DEFCON 5 . - Yes , sir . English - US - PSDH

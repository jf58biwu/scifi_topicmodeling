 1989 . The Federal Republic of Germany is the worlds most wealthy country . Law and order are the basic elements of a perfectly working society . The German industry has solved all problems . Everything is as right as rain . Energy shortage is an unknown term . There is also no more pollution , inflation or unemployment . The chemical industry found the dissolution of our sweetest dreams . Harmful drugs are no more . Every piece of information and entertainment in TV or the press is produced and published by a single big corporated group . The chairman of this concern is called the " Blue Panther " . He only has one enemy : " Krysmopompas " ! Jansen ! Please report ! Anton here . Jansen ! Please answer ! Jansen ! Please answer ! Anton here . Jansen , answer please . Jansen ! Jansen ! He has to respond eventually ! We mustn 't lose time ! Whenever I need him , he is not available . - Maybe he 's at the police-disco ? - Then go and get him out of there ! He is always at the police - disco , when I need him . Jansen ! Jansen ! Boss ! Boss ... I got to talk with you . It 's urgent ! The Chief of Police is seeking you . You 're not at your best . I 'll change my clothes now , MK-1 Anton . It 's really urgent . Please turn off the sirens , we don 't want to draw the peoples attention on it . Now please turn off the sirens ! - We 've only about one hour left . - 53 minutes , Anton . Actually that is time enough . And 12 seconds on top of that , boss ! Mrs Schulze from DÃ¼sseldorf indeed has a surprisingly good stamina . Our laugh-contest is going on now for 16 hours , our final contestants are in best mood , and Mr Otto from Uelzen made it to the finals for the 2nd time . It seems like he is the favorite . Hello ! I 'm back again , Barbara . So what do I have for you today ? Correct . The weather . The weather forecast : It will be nice , gorgeous . - 3rd annual Laugh-Competition - There won 't be any clouds , no rain . Sun , sun , ... wonderful sun ! Everything all right ? I just missed the elevator because of you . Would you please help me with my blouse ? - What 's up with that camera ? - Any objections ? - A cop behaving like this ! - So what ? I 'm No. 6 , the personnel manager . Lieutenant of Police Jansen , special investigation unit from the police headquarters . Oh yes ! Sure ! That 's it ! Aha ... " ... as Vengeance for the murder you committed , a powerful explosive charge has been placed in the building . The detonation is timed to exactly ... 2 p.m. on September 23rd " . This obviously has to be from an insane person ! Aha , an insane ... I believe it might be a woman . A woman ? One of the women my uncle abandoned . Well , I guess we immediately have to evacuate the building . This is absolutely impossible ! We 've got 4100 employees . Yes , yes , it sure is possible . Even though you 've got 4100 employees . This is our psychiatric center , we ... - We don 't have to do much with it . - Oh , I see . - You don 't have to do much with it . Guess I 'll have to consult my cousin . He 's the head of the company . The police lieutenant is here . They 're making fun of you , Blauer Panther . Quite impudent ! Good day . These people are worse than a Proko . Actually it looks alike me , but ... - But who is Krysmopompas ? - Your enemy , uncle ... Aha . So the persons in charge are related . I 'm not related to them . The lieutenant doesn 't want to understand , that we can not shut down our 48 broadcasting channels . Not to forget our papers and magazines . Millions of people are waiting for them . Well ! Cousin , he said we have to evacuate . I didn 't explain him yet , how much interrupting the production would cost ! Never mind . Primarily , we have to care for the human lives here . You ... really think there is a bomb in this building ? Nobody can tell for sure , but my team will immediately notify you , if they find something . Anyway it 's just like you said , primarily , one has to care for the human lives here . You are right . Pull up my car ! Attention ! Attention ! An important announcement : There will be a searching now . Please immediately leave the building through the stairways . Tell him to open his window . Ey ! Open your window ! It 's more secure ! The 31st floor has to be behind it ! - What did he say ? - He said , the 31st floor has to be behind it . The 31st floor ? It 's a common joke in our company ... whenever something goes wrong , it 's always the fault of the 31st floor . Just a saying , you know . Very funny . Ah-u-aha ! Please follow the instructions of the security personal . People with impaired mobility may use the fireman 's lift . The building ... could it collapse ? I 'm not an engineer so I can 't answer this . If it collapses they 'll say , we arranged it . Due to the insurance . Everybody knows , that this building is way too small for this enterprise . Isn 't the business doing rather well ? No , but that won 't hinder us from expanding . 13 minutes and 59 seconds have past now . Ten ! Turn off the music , you snob ! Five , Four , Three , Two , One ... One , two , three , Mississippi ... zero ! So , are you authorized to issue directives now ? When those two are gone , I am . Aha . Then please dismiss all ... all the people . All of them ? Did you think about the costs ? The costs , ma 'am , I 'm not concerned ! The executive suite is frantic , Jansen ! I did my best , Chief . Think about the people who thought there really was a bomb . You are well aware , that they hardly will feel safe in the future . The executive suite wanted you to declare it as a fire drill . My God , Chef . You know , that 20 % of the people won 't take a fire drill seriously . I don 't wan to criticize you . You 're my best man . But this case is really special . You don 't mess with these guys . The delinquent has to be located and sentenced . Without delay ! I 'll do my best , but it will take some time ... We are rather clueless at the moment , Mr Chief of Police . Keep in mind , that you 're talking to your supervisor ! I think you are worrying to much , Chief . No , no , no ... it 's ... you got 4 days for this . 4 days to solve this case . - And you must be successful ! - 4 days ? I 'll do my best . But I don 't get why there is this time limit . Why only 4 days ? That 's all I 've been conceded . Only 4 short days . You 'll understand , when we meet . Guess I 'll have to consult my cousin . He 's the head of the company . Anton , is it you ? Yes , boss , me . We 've got the tentative analysis of the bomb threat . Wasn 't that fast ? Please avoid all superfluous explanations . Anton ... " The paper , woodfree , of high quality It was folded and the ripped off from a larger sheet ; not cut " . - What 's up with that camera ? - Anton ! " The characters were printed recently , not older than 3 days " . The envelope was given out by the concern . A business reply envelope , used to renew industrial subscriptions . No fingerprints . And can the post office distribute any info ? The letter was receipt in the western post office , at any time between 9 p.m. Wednesday and 9 a.m. today . Attention ! Lieutenant . Again the television ? Why are they here this time , Anton ? For the new show of our police disco , called " Vitamin C " . Na , I don 't like these shows . And what did the psychologist say ? He didn 't give a statement yet . Please clear the areaway ! We bid you welcome to our police-therapy-center ! Oh , it seems like they 'll not sleep very well , Anton . A nightmare , lieutenant . First we prohibit alcohol , because it makes the people aggressive . And then we create living conditions which drive people into getting hammered . And therefore we 're beating them up . You should watch your mouth , Anton . Never say something like that again . Never again , got that ? Never again ! Yes , lieutenant . Krysmopompas ! Krysmopompas ! 1st Day . Lieutenant ! What are you looking for in my desk , MK-1 Anton ? Huh ? Tell me already ! Your natron enables you to think clearly again . May I move now ? - Lieutenant ? - Prepare my natron . The psychologist says , our guy probably was not male . Chances are 50 : 50 , that it was a woman . He or she definitely felt treated wrongfully by the society . It could also have been a group of people , though . He believes he could strike again . Concerning the psychology , that 's all . Thanks , Anton , that is a really back-breaking information . Yes , and now the chemical results . Regarding the origin of the paper the lab says : The machine which produced it actually belongs to the concern . I see ... the concerns own machine ? Yes , theirs . It 's used to print commendations , which are given out to employees , who were a worthy representative for the company . Mostly awarded after retirement . This envelope , Anton , is addressed to me . I opened it for you . Gold ? Yes , the lab found gold dust in the glue . - I 'll have a coffee too . - Yes , boss . That 's it . Simply severed . This morning I visited the personnel director . She told me they 've only given out 25 or maybe up to 30 of them . She 'll compile a detailed list for us . It looks like you 're slowly memorizing what I 've been struggling to teach you . - And it only took me 7 years ! - Avoid superfluous comments . Obtain this list . Sure , lieutenant . My cup ! Good morning lieutenant of police , Jansen . Good morning . These are the astrological observations I selected for you . " HEALTH : Be cautious " Assembled by the ministry of culture . " LOVE : It 's like in a desert ... " An advantageous star constellation ... " JOB : Plenty to do " Excuse me , lieutenant . Avoid superfluous comments . Your assistant this ... Anton , he was at the concern snooping around . Yes , he had my explicitly indicated permission . From now on you have to do everything on your own , personally . Treat this like a state secret . You are not allowed to inform anyone about your methods of investigation . Not even me . I can 't catch your drift , Chief . And don 't forget the hard-and-fast time limit . I ... Deadline is Monday , noontime . - Do you know this woman ? - The personnel director . - And how did this happen ? - She fell from the 13th floor . - I see , the 13th floor ! Suicide . Sweetheart , we didn 't have a single suicide in the past 4 years in the whole country . Excuse me , lieutenant : " Unexpected exitus " . Good for you , you remembered the correct expression . - Murder ? - Yes , murder ! That 's also the word the guy used in his threatening letter . Ya sure , but this is absolutely bizarre ! During the long existence of our enterprise there 's never been a murder . - Oh ! What about an unexpected exitus ? - Nope . This was the first time . A pilgarlic , who knows what came over her ? Jumping out of the window , for no reason ! This person was working on a list and we believe , this is the reason ... Ya , ya , ya , you 'll get that list ! You 've got foes . Individuals , private person , ... groups , fringe groups , competitors . Have you actually watched our channels once ? - I don 't watch TV regularly . - Oh , then have a look right now . Lieutenant , this is the purpose , the nature , the true spirit of our organisation . Yes , I can see that ! What do you think : How many people are watching our channel at this moment ? I can 't tell ! 99.3 % of all households . That 's egregious indeed ! Should our contestants persevere until tonight , we 'll probably even reach 99.9 % You see ? There is no competition for us . We do not have enemies . Apparently the people like what we do . I believe little Rita is gonna win the race . Last year she exceeded everybody at the Crying-contest ! - You never laugh ? - Not on duty . On duty , never . The upper echelon are slowly going too far . Krysmopompas must ... Oh , excuse me , I didn 't know you ... eh ... " Lieutenant Jansen : Awarded with highest honors at the state-academy of administration ! " " Positive : Anti-Proko-campaign : 15x unexpected exitus " " Anti-alcohol-campaign : 44 imprisonments " - That 's good to know ! " Negative : alcohol addict " You got everything you need ? I instructed my employees to support you in every respect . Oh , thanks . I also need absolute freedom of movement for the concerns premises . This is indispensable for my investigations . Can be arranged . But please act as discreet as possible . It 's not necessary to remind our employees of the recent incident . You 'll receive an identity card , which grants you access to virtually every place here . Also to the 31st floor ? Oh , you heard about that too ? Alright , I want you to know everything . It 's true , we do have a mysterious inner department , which at night , hunts down ... " evil conspirators " ! " Personnel director " Elena Farr . No , thank you . Do you know her ? Amazing ! Avoid superfluous comments . I 've seen her here . She 's " Play-Play " of the year . - Or was it last year ? - Really ? I forgot about the name . Elena Farr , F-A-R-R . Anton ? She 's not been here since last April . Only consumed soft drugs . She 's been arrested twice 2 years ago due to graffiti . But nothing serious . I see . Due to graffiti ? Do you have her address ? Those are all living around there . Do you know where it is , lieutenant ? Westside alley . Hello . It 's Barbara ! And what does Barbara come with ? Correct ! The weather . It will be sunny . No clouds . No clouds at all . Nothing . A clear sky , a blue sky . Sun . Sun ! Do you know Elena Farr ? F-A-R-R ? F-A-R-R ? - What do you want here ? - I 'm looking for Elena Farr , F-A-R-R . She moved , but don 't ask me where to . And when ? You don 't need to ask me that either . Your ID card , please . I 'm from the criminal investigation department ! - Oh , pardon . - I 'm sorry , lieutenant Jansen . Just a random routine examination . - I hope you don 't take it personally . - Nope . Is it true , that you solved all your cases so far ? Don 't ask superfluous questions . By the way , your ... monitoring was unprofessional . I 'll have to report you . Sadly . Boss , it 's me , Anton , it 's important . I have to talk to you by all means . It 's ... don 't switch it off , boss ! It really is ... You 'll defeat the Blue Panther , Krysmopompas . Elena Farr . Krysmopompas . 2nd Day . Jansen ? Jansen , answer ! Jansen , answer now ! Jansen here . The case is solved . Who , who solved the case ? The boss of the concern . He had a suspicion and he confronted the suspect with it ... who confessed the crime . You only have to record the plea of guilty . " The " plea of guilty ? What does " the " plea of guilty mean ? I don 't know if it 's a man or a woman but I 'm sure , you 'll find out , when you question him ... or her . Well , don 't be dejected . The boss of the concern had a better starting position . Your record will remain . Record the confession , then everything will be forgotten . Do you understand , what I mean ? Sure , I understand . - So , feel free to tell me everything . - There is not much to tell ... It was a rainy Wednesday , I was bored . Wednesdays are always the most boring days in the week , don 't you agree ? Not necessarily . I don 't like Mondays . Sometimes Thursdays are horrible too . So I had the idea , but my uncle blames it on the comic . - What ? Blamed the comic ? - Never seen before ? " Krysmopompas , the spirit of evil , the inexpiable foe of the Blue Panther ... " Avoid superfluous explanations . Krysmopompas ! So Krysmopompas gave me the idea . Then I wrote the ... threat , cut out the characters of the Wednesday paper , glued them on the left page of the diploma , put it in the reply envelope and sent it to the concern . That 's all . I swear ! Hopefully you won 't put me into prison for this . Not necessarily . Please try to remember as detailed as possible . The scissors you used to cut out the characters , was ... that the same scissors you used to separate the right from the left side of the diploma ? - I can 't remember . - D 'oh ... It may have been the same . But it also could have been a different . You 've got many scissors . Right . I 've got several scissors on my desk . You can control that . Happy ? I 'm happy . Very happy ! Jansen ? Jansen , why don 't you listen ? Answer me ! Boss , do you hear me ? Jansen ! Jansen , why don 't you listen ? I need to talk to you , urgently . Don 't switch it off , boss . I 've worn him down ! - Who 's talking there all the time ? - How did you know he was lying ? Jansen , do you have any evidence ? Any ? I 'd like a hot meal again , eventually . Jansen here . The list of employees of the concern , who were given a diploma ... did it arrive yet ? This morning , lieutenant . Then please have a look , if Elena Farr , F-A-R-R Elena , is listed . No , lieutenant . Elena Farr is not there . And you are really sure ? Okay , fine . Deliver it to me anyway . Thanks . It 's about Anton ; the last surveillance report . Last night he was seen with a well known Proko . Tighten the surveillance . - Boss , the latest lab report ! - That 's egregious ! They 've got the paper the characters were cut out from . - Really ? - Yes ! They 're from a western print from Wednesday . I don 't believe it ... Anton , you are so up to date . Don 't you remember ? The letter was stamped on a Wednesday . - Yes ? - It fits , doesn 't it ? Yes Anton , it fits . Good . What should I do ? - Nothing . - Why ? Because you 'll drive home now , pack your stuff and go on an unpaid leave . - But why ? - Because I say so , Anton . Damn it , I have the right to know this . Why ? Anton , you aren 't drunken , are you ? No , but that is a good idea . Krysmopompas ! Krysmopompas ! Don 't move , police ! Freeze ! I came to excuse my nephew 's actions , lieutenant . You shouldn 't have . You shouldn 't have applied these psycho-practices . Oh anyway , those were only the mildest ' instruments ' . It was degrading ! And not only for my nephew . You should have come to me instead . My methods are more efficient than these degrading and cruel methods . The police methods are degrading and cruel ? I talked to the minister . He 's agreeing with me . This case is more than just a nuisance . Yes indeed , more than just a nuisance . He 's up to forgetting the whole thing . Jansen ... You should also forget everything . - Yes , I realized that . - Well then ! - But ... - But ? But I can 't , that would ruin my reputation . Boss , I have to talk to you urgently , please ! Hands up ! Watch out , Anton ! I 'm okay . Follow them ! My weapon ... Look out , over there ! I 'll take care of the other one ! I 'll get you ... you ! - MK-1 Anton , please respond . - Yes , boss ? Report an unexpected exitus . 26 , 27 , 28 ... Now they 're having you in their grip , Lieutenant . Avoid superfluous thoughts , Anton . You followed me . I gotta talk to you , private . I was ... I found a person , that knows certain things ... about the concern . I got in touch with him last night . He told me ... But , Anton , we 've been aware of that for ages ! He is a Proko , isn 't he ? Yes . He said he is . He said the concern has a special department . He said everything we want to know can be found in the 31st floor . Alright , Anton . We 'll see . 3rd Day . - She 's not living here anymore ! - I 'm aware . You 're Alex Zerling and ... you are on my list . Oh well , it 's about time every - body gets to know the truth . Well as the time passed I got kinda used to be paid by them . But basically I sold my soul long time ago , before I started to work for them ... as one of those imprudent heroes , who write the fabulous adventures of the Blue Panther . Well , I felt safe . Because I knew everything about them ... About the murder ? Murder , rape , theft , denial , falsified documents ... I know everything they do , everything ! About the 31st floor ? - You know it exist ? - Have you been there ? Has anyone ever been there without vanishing ? I can 't tell . You said something about rape ? When the director does it , they call it sail-in or escapade . But I 'd call it rape , wouldn 't you ? All those innocent little girls with their sweet petite butts and their small tits ... So you wanted vengeance ? I wanted justice . But I was a coward and preferred a payoff . Exactly like the spirit of the evil . Krysmopompas ? You know my stories ? Yeah ... some . But after sitting in this silent place for a while , I realized , that I was punished . I knew , one night they 'd be knocking at my door . " man 's best friend , a policeman ! " I 'll pack my stuff . Hang on a moment please . Tell me please , err ... your diploma ... Your diploma , do you still have it ? Yes , of course ! That 's the most important item I own . - Would you like to see it ? - Yes , if you still have it , sure . Just a moment please . So you want to leave this room ? But you 'll not run away ! Of course not . Hang on . Thanks . I 'll be right back . One , two , three , Mississippi ... I see ! An unexpected exitus ! 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ... Continue to count , Jacqueline . Mommy mommy , Zerling is dangling and jerking around ! Mommy mommy , Zerling is dangling and jerking around ! Zerling ? Jansen here . I need an ambulance . I think we finally found the culprit . Yes , boss . Look , uncle ! I found this . Is this yours ? Zerlings diploma . - Jansen here . - Yes , boss . Forget the ambulance , I was wrong . And stop listening to music while on duty , MK-1 Anton ! Wait here for me , Anton . Hello , I 'm Barbara . I 'm lieutenant of police , Jansen . I visited you because I want to talk with you about ... Unfortunately I 'm not at home . Please leave me your name and your phone number . Lieutenant of police , Jansen ! - I require some information from you . - MK-1 Anton . - Please answer ! - Chief of Police ? Jansen ? Jansen ! Jansen is not here . - Hello , who is there ? - Lieutenant Jansen . - What ? - Lieutenant Jansen . - I can 't hear well . - I 'm assigned to investigate here . Well , then please come in , OK ? Come in , come in ! Show me your badge . Madam ! This investigation is about ... about a rather delicate issue . It 's also about your ... former engagement as editor in charge . Ah , the bomb ... - Yes . You know it ? - Naturally , I still have connections . I never really retired from " the Golden Woman " . - Escorial-Green ? ( Liqueur Vol.56 % ) I can see you are an art connoisseur , captain . This is a gift from an artist . From a great artist ! From the boss of the concern . A genius ! He could have been living during the Renaissance era . Well , then why did you quit your job ? - I wouldn 't call it a ' job ' . - But well , it looked like one to me ... It was a mission . A mission , exactly ! That 's egregious , ya . - It was an enlightenment ! - I see . Enlightenment , sure , got it . Whenever my mission was accomplished I phased out for the rest of the day . In no time at all I expanded my show to a revue-gala reaching 99 % of the viewers . How ? - That 's what you wonder . Through self-sacrifice . I was solely living for my mission . And due to it I opened my heart for the many many viewers , to satisfy their true needs . I embellished their everyday life with sweet dreams and with amorous chants . What kind of chants ? Amorous . Amorous chants . When you quited " the Golden Woman " , you received a diploma , didn 't you ? Of course , and it means a lot to me ! It 's a reminder of the millions of letters the thrilled viewers sent to me . Good people from all walks of life . Workers , physicians , telephonists , midwifes ... Tinkerer ... - Do you mind showing it to me ? - Yes , indeed ! No . At the moment I don 't have it at home . But my ' assistant ' has it . She 's having it signed by all important personalities that know me for my album . - Is it that urgent ? - Yes , urgent is the right word for it . Darling ! - Yes ? - Would you come here for a second ? Of course you may sign it as well , if you want to , capt ... Lieutenant ! - Lieutenant . Yes you said it before , lieutenant . - Yes , I said that ! Good afternoon ! - Good afternoon . - Darling , cautious , cautious ! The dirt may drop off . I even don 't know , where the seed was coming from . This is forbidden , isn 't it , lieutenant ? Yes , it 's forbidden , just like many other things are too ... Darling , the lieutenant needs to see my diploma . - You still have it , right ? - Yes , I got your diploma . I don 't have it here , it 's at my house . Of course you don 't need to sign it , if you don 't want to . Due to your profession ... I could understand that . Oh , thanks you for your understanding . I 'll be at home in about an hour . - Thanks . - You are welcome . The Chief is trying to contact you all the morning . I know . - Is he pissed ? - I 'd say rather hysterical . He believes you are not calling back on purpose , whatever that means . He said you are ungrateful , ruthless and loveless . - Oh ... ' loveless ' ... he didn 't say that ? ! - He sure did ! That 's egregious , really ! And he said I should remind you of Monday morning and that you 're running out of time . That 's all what he said . We only have less than 18 hours : No more than 17 hours and 50 minutes . - How much time 's left ? - 17 hours and 50 minutes ! Jansen , should I fire ? No , avoid superfluous comments . - Damn you , Krysmopompas ! - What did he say ? Krysmopompas ! - Krysmopompas ! - What 's going on here ? Report an unexpected exitus , Anton . An overdose . Too much sugar in his dreams . - Aren 't you all right ? - Sure , sure , I 'm not that bad . I need a boat . - A boat ? - Exactly . May I invite you ? No , I need to ask you a few questions . Did you know you have to be very careful when cooking , because after just one minute their tougher than al dente . and just seconds later , well , then they 're basically capot . When I met you in the 30th floor you were frantic . You do know the concern boss , he is a difficult man . What ? It was you who got yourself into that affair ... That 's true . - He promised me ... - What ? to behave , as he always promised . And I believed him . At which department are you actually working ? I 'm the assistant of the concern director . - His concubine . - Yes . Any objections ? I 'm drawing too . And why me ? Because I think you have a ... a nice face ... - easy to draw . - I see , easy to draw ... Nice ! I always like to see myself on pictures . I like this one best . Oh , you like this one best ? Also nice . Barbara called you " her assistant " . I can do more for Barbara as her right hand . Watch this ... - Escorial-green ? You rejected the drink , because you 're clever . The concern director is trying to get rid of Barbara . But she 's keeps her tail up . - My vegetables ! - Your vegetables are not legal just ... as wine and as this videotape aren 't and graffiti also isn 't . That 's why we got together . Now we 're friends . You are her spy , right ? Exciting , isn 't it ? Are you a Proko ? You 're such representative cop ! Aren 't you afraid of getting arrested ? I 've been arrested before and they had to let me go . - Wanna be my guest for dinner ? - Oh , no thanks . As I thought , you 're just a common cop . Either a very good or a very bad one . Hey , you forgot to ask me about Barbabas diploma ! Indeed , I totally forgot that . Holy cow ! I 'm suddenly shacking due to excitement ! Because maybe we 'll see a new world record today . And now , dear Sir or Madam , if you just hold on a bit more little Rita , then the record is yours . Ladies and gentlemen , this is an emotional moment , it 's the very moment ! Einstein , Napoleon and now her ! Applause , she did it ! It 's a new world record . This is an incredible , virtually dramatic record . Little Rita beat the old record . She has just won the 3rd annual Laugh-Competition ! And there she is . - 31 4th Day . I was waiting for you . Oh really ? Do you confess you were writing an anonymous letter to the CEO 's office ? Show me your badge . No , I 'm not willing to admit that . How long did it take you to come here ? My minimum time was 50 minutes and 33 seconds ; starting at the concern . Would you finally please confess you wrote the letter ? I 'm probably not the only person you 've been talking to about this issue . You can say that again . I 'm gonna tell you the truth . Pressed for time ? Well , actually not anymore . By the way , when did you quit your occupation ? My petition for release took effect exactly 47 days ago . When we evacuated the building you were also there . Why ? I was visiting friends in the psychiatric center . - Friends ? - Yes . I 've got many friends there . Former colleagues , all in therapy . When you were leaving the concern , you received a diploma . Please show it to me . I don 't have it anymore . - So you eventually confess ? ! - No . Come on , you did write the threatening letter ... - Confess ! - No . Aha . What was your department ? I was the editorial staff for cultural matters . Then you should know a lot about the concern . I know everything about the concern . - Also about the murder ? - Especially about the murder . And about the special department ? Of course I do ; I 've been working there for 7 years , 4 months and 17 days . On the 31st floor ? Yes , the 31st floor . Oh really ? Quite exquisite ... Please show me the 31st floor . Come on . Show it to me . Come on , show me the 31st floor . There you go ! The 31st floor is the attic , altered to be absolutely soundproof , directly above the CEO 's rooms . There are no windows , but artificial light , and perfectly air-conditioned . There is a way up through a door . And then there are 2 more doors . One of them is always locked . - You saw it . - Not really . Continue . We were the only ones who had a key for this secured door . Does it happen to be this key ? This is an universal key for the executive staff . I see . Then please explain to me , what was the task of the special department . Nothing . You 'll need to elaborate this a bit . Okay , I 'll explain . When the gazette I was working for had been taken over by the concern , I received a quite tempting offer by the boss . He said I was one of the great and important personalities in our country . He said he was worried our people could be losing their ability to reflect on things . And he said , that we as a group of gifted intellectuals had all liberties in his concern and all the money which is needed to create a new paper and a magazine , as well as a television program . Whatever was necessary to re-animate people to reason thinks again . He showed me a list of who already accepted his offer . Those were the best ! 23 men and women . The pure elite . What do you mean ... they " were " the best ? We moved into the 31st floor . A dust-free attic . It was terrific ! A secret project for the spiritual renewal of your nation ! Though it wasn 't easy . Consider a room full of brilliant , egocentric individuals , who 're trying to be a team ! It took more than a year , before we finished our first issue . It was dedicated and biting . radical but also human , profound and analytical to demonstrate the madness . We were absolutely astonishment when the concern director went crazy about it . But a few things would have to be refined , he said . Well , there you go . That 's the whole shocking story ! And he kept going on using that trick . Whatever we developed wasn 't perfect enough . Someday we lost our will , we were frustrated and tired . We 've lost valuable life time . Our dreams went to pieces . Some of us made up and wanted to publicize aggressive anti-concern comics . Eventually this lead to violence . But I was against this ! Then they teamed up with the Proko . He fooled us by murdering our minds ! Traitors ! Elena Farr ! Those are the Proko from the 31st floor ! You saved my life . - Are you injured ? - Ah , just a bruise . A rubber bullet as used by the police . AKZ , please respond ! Jansen and the unknown person are driving through the west-tunnel . Your pace is good . You could have spared the long way here this morning . Really ? My confession would have arrived tomorrow by mail . I don 't mind , that 's my job . The concern also received a new letter , another bomb threat . written on the other page of the diploma , together with my name . But you didn 't actually plant a bomb ? I 'm not skilled at all with technical stuff . - What ? You don 't believe me ? - Well , we 'll sure find out . Tomorrow would have been my 8th anniversary . This is where we differ from each other . I stopped counting my years of service long time ago . AKZ here ! Jansen brought the unknown person to the 16th police station and is heading now for the concern . The machines ! Poor Weiss ! " Police headquarters " Boss ? - It 's me , Jansen . - Take a seat . I 've been trying to contact you for 2 days now . Well ... You ignored , you actually didn 't even listen , to the instructions of your boss . I 'll say goodbye this afternoon . But I found him , just one hour ago I arrested him ! Yes I know . Irony of fate , isn 't it ? But why precisely today ? Well I eh ... better don 't talk about it . Be careful . The concern knows about your drinking habits . Oh well , they 've always been knowing that . There are a few more things we need to discuss . The new bomb threat ... do we have to take it serious ? Mn ... no . But there is no 100 % assurance ? Concerning issues like that , there never is a guarantee , chief . But a quick house search would ... No ! Don 't cause even more trouble ! Go and speak the concern director . Now eh ... now you 're also in danger . Lieutenant , you have to leave now . The Chief of Police is critically ill . Oh yeah , right , caregiver . These people are really powerful . - What do you mean by that ? - Lieutenant , you have to leave now . They 're already waiting for him with the car . He can 't control what he 's saying any longer . - It ... it has already begun ! - What has begun ? They didn 't even wait for the afternoon , these bastards ! You did a very good job , Jansen . MK-410 , we need emergency assistance . The Chief of Police needs to be in intensive care . Gosh darn it ! Let him alone now ! Chief of Police , Jansen . Here AK-1 . What 's the status ? Lieutenant Jansen is entering the mansion of the concern director . Thanks . Hold the position . Finally we nabbed one of the guys , who really was there , who worked in the 31st floor . Sometimes I really ask myself ; Is it me or the others that are mad ? And both cases are totally unrealistic . So what would you suggest , lieutenant ? A house search . And if necessary an evacuation of course too . That 's impossible ! And what if there really is a bomb ? An evacuation ? So you think this madman might really have planted a bomb ? It can 't be ruled out , the possibility can 't be denied . I want to wait with any action until we actually have the treat . Maybe we 'll find an answer to why he is doing this . You might be right . Lets talk about it tomorrow morning after the funeral . My poor nephew ! I somehow blame myself for not taking the bomb threat too serious . I thought it was just the phantasm of a nut case . You did a great job , Jansen . Respect ! I made inquiries about you . You 're holding an exclusive record , you solved every single case so far . So far , yes . A man who is playing in your league is hard to find . Might be true . Lieutenant , didn 't you realize yet , that this is a political complot ? Political ? No . Krysmopompas ! - The spirit of the evil . - It 's lurking around everywhere . Only god knows , what I did to influence him ; but he can 't be influenced easily . Didn 't you try to stop it from being released ? And thereby knocking the Blue Panther off ? No . No ! He has to be outflanked . Did you never think about retiring ? No . You could earn a multiple in private enterprises . Possibly . Lets talk about this , when the situation is settled . I 've got a lovely inter - national project running . And you 'd be the perfect man for it , Jansen . What 's up , Anton ? We 'll check once again and then leave the building . - Hello , Lieutenant ? - Jansen , here . - It 's about Weiss , he wants to confess something more . - Alright , he shall talk ! There are still more people . Please , please rescue the Proko in the 31st floor . It 's the truth . And I forgot to tell you about the door . But you did tell me about it ! There is no door , there is no 31st floor . I checked it out ! Nothing but wires and machines . Behind them there is a door . And the bomb ... But I didn 't plant it , the concern director did ... - A new trick ... - Is the building evacuated ? - Yes . - Are you sure ? Yes boss , building evacuated . All thirty floors are empty . There are still people in there . People ? Where ? We have to evacuate them from the roof . There is still enough time . - Boss , the electricity was turned off . - I can see that ! - Only the emergency light is on . - Then we have to walk upstairs ! - Boss ! You aren 't gonna make it . - You don 't look any fitter either . Well where are they ? Your people ? You still don 't get it ? The 31st floor ! Oh it exists ? - Yes , it really does exist . - And how to get there ? There 's a door in the 30th floor , I opened it already . You 'll only see machines , but those are dummies . There 's another door behind them . And there is the 31st floor , I guess . I 'm going ! Lets see , we 've got 13 minutes left . OK , then you 'll go ! Yes , lieutenant . You are listening to the most recent news : Today at 2 p.m. there was an explosion on the roof of the concern . According to the lieutenant of police Jansen , it probably was a matter of arson . During a dramatic rescue mission , lieutenant Jansen was able to save 3 men , who later died though due to their fatal injuries . The concern announced that there was a damage to property of several million Deutsche Mark . Anton ! Why are you still here Lieutenant ? Everyone else already moved to the new headquarters . We have to sanitize here now .

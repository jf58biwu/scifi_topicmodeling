 Good evening . I 'm Howard K. Smith , and this is the state of the war tonight . In Athens , the cradle of democracy was once again shaken ... as the Visitors took command of that city . As has been the case throughout the world ... the Visitors declared martial law ... and began rounding up suspected opposition leaders . At this hour , the fate of Gregory Cannis , the head of the Pan-Hellenic Resistance ... remains unknown . On this side of the Atlantic , the news is much brighter ... as Resistance efforts in cities and towns across the nation continue to grow . In Miami , Tampa , and Key West ... residents fought the invaders to a standstill ... thanks in large part to this woman , Janet Weinberg ... a computer programmer from Daytona Beach . She led a raid on a detention camp ... in which over 250 American captives were freed . Ms. Weinberg has been awarded this week 's ... Freedom Network Medal Of Valor for her distinguished act of bravery . And that 's where we stand tonight . From the Freedom Network in New York , our hopes are with you . Good night . Never relax . You got to be more careful , there 's a war going on . I thought we were supposed to have faith in each other . Faith is for nuns and amateurs . Come on , we 've got three minutes to meet the munitions truck . The truck is approaching . Prepare to test the force field . Now , a little surprise for the Resistance . It works . What happened to the truck ? Diana 's got herself a new toy . Come on . What happened ? The computer , it 's gone into overload . And the force field ? Temporarily down . The binary code can 't sustain itself . I think we need a relay within the city . You think ? I want someone who knows . Nathan Bates called . He seemed upset . He demanded a meeting with you right away . Tell him I 'll be there within the hour . Meanwhile , prepare Jacob for interrogation . - Interrogation ? - That 's what I said . They are not lizards . Will you stop it ? It 's okay , you 're all right . It 's only a dream . - Just a dream . - Yeah . Everything 's fine . You 're with me now . A relay at Science Frontiers ? I didn 't just fall off the turnip truck . I 'm not about to let you set up a force field that 'll trap me in my own city . Of course not . I 'll provide access ... a tunnel through the force field ... giving you absolute control of all shipments in and out of the city . Think of the profits . I 'll need proof that this so-called tunnel works . And a personal code that makes my use of it failsafe . I knew we 'd come to terms . I 've begun to develop a certain faith in your practicality . I didn 't say soft soap , I said proof . You can prove it for yourself . You can create your own personal code by using any random combination ... - of four letters . - Only four ? Given all possible combinations ... the chances of someone breaching security ... are half a million to one . I 'll have a room set aside in the sub-basement . - Then we have a deal ? - Yes . By the way , only Galen , my chief systems technician ... - knows how to install it . - Very good . I 'll expect him tonight . Congratulations . You 've made the best choice ... for both of us . That is the man we are looking for . The trouble with you is , you don 't understand , do you ? You 'll give me the information I want or you 're going out of here in a trash bag . Take it easy , let him go . - I want him . - No . Go on outside . Cool off . Take a hike . You know , you 're in big trouble . I 'm okay , but my friend 's a little nuts , know what I mean ? I don 't know how long I can hold him off . - He wants to hurt me . - No . He wants to kill you . I 've seen him do it . It 's not a pretty sight . So why don 't you talk to me ? I 'll see what I can do . - What do you want ? - You 're the head military attach√© . You must know the name of the scientist who 's behind this force field . He 's on the Mother Ship . His name is ... Jacob , you don 't understand . I need the force field in place more than I need you . I am not afraid to die . Unfortunately , your choice isn 't that easy . I won 't let you die . I 've had it with your pacifism . You 've run out of time . I won 't let you make me your tool for destruction . Tool . That 's a very interesting choice of words ... for someone about to undergo the conversion process . Did you think your age and status would exempt you from torture ? The choice is simple : Cooperate , or be broken . Commander to the bridge . Call from Earth , priority three . I 'd hate to have to make you an example ... to those who put individual conscience above duty to State . Jacob is a genius , and the father of our technology . - With a PhD in death . - No . He is against war . He 's a confirmed pessimist . - Pacifist . - Yes , that . We have to get him down here before Diana puts up that force field ... and permanently cuts us off . You 're thinking what I 'm thinking ? We 're gonna raid Diana 's little playpen . No comparison . Comparison ? It 's no match . You 're much prettier . Sorry . I didn 't know I 'd do that . That makes two of us . I think you should do it more often . Are you and Robin finding everything you need ? Yes . Your house is wonderful . And we 're grateful to you for letting us stay here . It 's just nice to have somebody around . Especially you . Listen , I got to into the city for a while , but I shouldn 't be too long . You want to go out when I come back ? Good . Be ready about 7 : 30 . There 's a little place I want to take you to . We can dance , have something to eat . - Just kind of be together . - Just us ? Just us . Elizabeth , was that Kyle ? Yes . I wish you 'd told me . I wanted to talk to him . There 's something I want to tell you . Just between us , okay ? You 're probably going to think I 'm crazy , but I think I 'm in love with him . Him ? Kyle . I know it might make things awkward for you , but I can 't help it . I haven 't felt this way about anybody in so long . Not since your father . You do like him , don 't you ? Yes . - He 's very nice . - I know . I also know the two of you are going to be great friends . I 'm so happy , I just had to tell you . I 'm glad you did . Can I help you ? Who is this ? What the devil 's going on here ? Galen , I believe you have work to do . Didn 't you see the sign ? This area is off-limits . Off-limits ? I have a special security clearance . What are you talking about ? I think you know exactly what I 'm talking about . I was under the impression that I had a position of trust around here . You do ... as long as you keep out of what doesn 't concern you . - Your rules ? - My rules . You never spoke to me like this before . You never deserved it . It 's time you took a good hard look at where your loyalties are . I run things around here as I see fit ... and I don 't have to explain my actions to anybody . I trust you don 't have a problem with that . I 'm sorry . I was out of line . - I just assumed that perhaps ... - From now on , don 't . I 've always liked you , Julie . Don 't do anything to change that . We grab him , steal a fighter , land it there . Outside city limits ? What happens if Diana 's closed that sector off by the time we get back ? We 'll deal with it then . Just be there . LA 's too risky . Your dad 's security would detect us in a second . Where do you want me ? Decker and Mulholland 's the rendezvous point ... - 0500 . - I 'll get out there by afternoon . I 'm glad I caught you . How 's it going ? I 'm not sure , but something 's definitely going on . I think Bates is cooperating somehow with Diana in erecting this force field . There 's a room in the lab I can 't get clearance for . Any idea what 's in it ? Some kind of computer relay system . We need that scientist more than we thought . Can you get into that room ? Yeah , I can try . But you realize this is insanity , don 't you ? Don 't take any wooden computer chips . In the garage . Do you have a couple of minutes ? I wanted to talk to you . I 'm sort of in a hurry . - Got someplace I got to be . - Can I go with you ? Sorry , not this time . Have you seen Elizabeth around ? No , not since this afternoon . Why ? No reason , just tell her I said goodbye . Okay . Take care . Where 's your pass ? All right . Go ahead . - What are you doing in there ? - I knew you 'd be angry . I 'm not angry , I 'm just ... I just had to talk to you . It 's important . You don 't belong out here . - What am I going to do with you ? - You could send me back . - I could walk back . - No way . What is so critical that it couldn 't wait ? First you have to promise . - Promise what ? - Never to tell my mother I told you . - You 're not making any sense . - Just promise . Okay , I promise . Now what is it ? She 's in love with you . You stowed away to come out here to tell me that ? Because it 's wrong , then ... for me to love you , too . Robin 's nice . But there 's nothing going on between us . - It 's my fault . - No , it isn 't . Feelings just happen , they 're nobody 's fault . I like you . But even if there were no you ... I wouldn 't be in love with your mother . Can you understand that ? Yes , I can . Good . I hope you 're comfortable now . I 'd like you to arm the master computer . I 'm as concerned about what you 'd like as you are about my comfort . You 've had your chance ! Prepare the converter . I 'd like to go on record . You 're making a terrible mistake . Jacob was head of the Institute of Science ... decorated by the Leader as a hero of the State . - He must be respected . - Respect ? - I 'm more interested in results . - The Leader won 't be pleased . Somehow I knew that you were going to say that . Start . Increase the intensity . So much garbage . More . Good . Now complete the code . After them ! Don 't let them get off this ship ! Attention ! Aliens on board . Seal all entrances to the flight area . - Come on , move it . - They are armed . Shoot to kill . You ready for this ? He 's stone blind . Attention ! Aliens on board . Seal all entrances to the flight area . They are armed . - Which way is the flight deck ? - That way . They 're heading for flight deck number seven ! Door 's jammed . - Let 's blow it . - Don 't . If you destroy the door , you seal the flight deck . You got any suggestions ? - What is this ? It weighs a ton . - Surborium , a metal you lack on Earth . - Great . We need explosives . - Not necessarily . - Try access zone P. - They 're probably on the flight deck . Come on . Here they come . Here we go . They 've stolen a fighter and escaped . In spite of your security , Commander . My security was hardly a problem compared to what I 've seen here today . I 'll deal with you later . Close the force field . Do you really think you can threaten me ? This entire war effort has been a nasty joke . I 'm warning you . I want that fighter destroyed . Either blow it out of the sky or drive it into the force field . I know the facts , chapter and verse . If I were to report them to the Leader ... You would not survive long enough to enjoy his reaction . We 've got two bandits closing fast . - It seems like our guests have arrived . - Why don 't you make them welcome . Come on in , fellas , the door is open . - I thought you were a marksman . - Just fly the damn ship . - Keep it steady . - The object of the game is not to get hit . Come on in , suckers . Fry one lizard . - One down , one to go . - What a waste of life . Better them than us . Can 't shake him . I thought you said the object of the game was not to get hit . The game 's not over yet . What 's that ? We 're approaching the force field . Pull up ! Not quite yet . We 'll never make it . All right , hold on . - Donovan ! - That 's the only way to fly . It 's no use . We 're going in . There . The earth relay is in place . How do I activate my tunnel ? By simply typing in your four-letter code . Excellent . I 'll call you if I need you . Damn it , Nathan . Move to the right . Mr. Chiang , can you hear me ? Yes , sir . - Is the vehicle ready ? - Ready , sir . Good . Send him through . Excellent . My compliments to Diana . Congratulations . Not everyone can crash like that . Beats getting blown out of the sky . - Probably already got a fix on us . - We 're a long way from the Decker LZ . - The fugitives have been located . - Where ? Approaching the force field in the northwest sector . Then I have them . Alert all combat patrols in the area . I want them dead . I 'll see if I can raise Julie . Okay , old timer , let 's sit down . Wilderness to Shiloh . Do you read ? Over . Wilderness to Shiloh . Come in . I read you five-by-five . What 's going on ? - We 've got trouble out here . - What are you talking about ? - We 're down . - In one piece ? We 're fine . Tell Kyle we 're in the Santa Clara River Valley northwest of Newhall . Hold on . Somebody here you ought to talk to . Mike , it 's me . Are you all right ? We 're okay , but old man 's blind . No way we can make Decker . You don 't have to . Can you get to the l-5 where it meets the county line ? - We could try . Why ? - I saw the whole operation in the lab . Bates has a computer-generated safe corridor ... at the l-5 , right through the force field . - Can you get us through it ? - If I can crack his code . Give it your best shot . We 're on our way . Get Kyle and give him the coordinates . - Julie ? - Yeah ? May I guard your body ? No thanks , Willie . I think I can take care of myself . I 'm not what I once was . I slow you down . We 'll make it . Find somewhere to take a five . I 'm gonna check over there . You were foolish to bring me here . What is it you want from me ? We need you to destroy the force field Diana set up . I am a pacifist . I will not be a party to war or conquest . We didn 't ask for this war . You invaded us . We 're fighting for our lives . I cannot help you any more than I could help Diana and the Leader . And they betrayed me . They used my discoveries for destruction . Then this is your chance to make up for all that . You don 't understand . I am not a killer . I will not kill . - I need to lie down . - Lie down here . We 're not asking you to kill . We need your help to keep us alive . Let 's get out of here . I don 't like it , it 's too quiet . Troopers . Down . - What 's she doing here ? - Relax , it 's a long story . It wasn 't his fault . Elias radioed us your coordinates and destination . It took me two hours to find you . I wouldn 't have found you at all if it wasn 't for her . - She had a feeling you 'd be in this canyon . - I knew . That child . She 's one of us . - I thought he couldn 't see . - How do you know about Elizabeth ? Look , on her hand . The mark of Zon . The symbol of our faith inextinguishable . Perhaps you will be my eyes . This is all terrific , but they 've got to be after us in battalions . Let 's go . Wilderness , this is Shiloh . You copy ? Shiloh , this is Wilderness . You got us . Go ahead . How close are you to the l-5 ? Close , but someone out here has other plans for us . Just keep going . But don 't cross until you hear from me . Out . Four letters , any sequence . Shoot . - How far now ? - Five minutes , tops . Look , more bandits . Okay , we take the motocross approach , then . Shiloh , this is Wilderness . Do you read ? Come in . Do you read ? Come in . You really shouldn 't be here . You know that . Do you copy ? Over . Hang on . Come on . They 're right behind us . Let 's get a move on . Hold up here . Shiloh , this is Wilderness . It 's now or never . I can 't get the code . - Do you have any suggestions ? - I can 't help you . Got any ideas , Kyle ? Kyle . Of course . Go ahead , you got it . Think you can get the old man through ? Go on , take him . Wait a minute . What if Julie was wrong ? At this point , it won 't make a difference either way . There they are ! You go on ahead . No , just a little bit farther and we 'll be safe . No , I 'll stay here . Why ? I must end this terrible thing that I have created . When Diana demanded that I complete the force field ... I preset her computer to focus its entire range of energy on this : A ring of surborium . The time has come . Listen to me . You are the future . Someday , Amon , the High Priest of Zon , will find you . Now leave me . Go . Goodbye . The force field ! It 's self-destructing . He 's gone . How do you figure that one ? You don 't . You just thank whatever it is you believe in . Let 's go home . You were right . Lydia 's personal shuttle is gone . - Where is she going ? - To the Leader . She made no attempt to camouflage her trail . To our beloved Leader ... who will no doubt listen to her lies with the utmost attention . He won 't listen to her . You have so much to learn . - Is Lydia within scanning range ? - Yes , Diana . Put her on the screen . Blow her out of the sky . You heard me . English

 'The year is 1987 'and NASA launches the last of America 's deep-space probes . 'In a freak mishap , Ranger 3 and its pilot , Captain William " Buck " Rogers , 'are blown into an orbit which freezes his life-support systems 'and returns Buck Rogers to Earth 500 years later . ' - How 's that , Twiki ? - Bidibidibidi . A little to the right . - Is that better ? - Solid . As someone said , you 're never more nostalgic than for things you once knew and have no more . Bidibidibidi . Who said that ? Me . ( Buzzer ) - Hi , Buck . - Hi , Wilma . Dr Huer . Say , what 's this ? A change of scenery . It was beginning to feel like solitary confinement here . Why didn 't you say ? We could have had windows put in . Why bother ? It all looks the same . With the city 's climate control , nothing ever changes around here . I feel sorry for you people . You 'll never know the joy of discovering a sunset that just happens . A pale hint of mauve . Everything is programmed . Even your climate . You know no fall , no spring , no rain , no snow , no nothing . It 's always the same . When I went outside , I couldn 't believe it was January . It is January , isn 't it ? Yes . January 7 . Dr Huer and I were on our way to see the new holographic dance troupe . - Would you like to join us ? - No , thank you , Wilma . I think I 'll pass . I don 't feel like going out tonight . Well , good night . Olvion Emigration Patrol to Terran starfighter . Decelerate immediately . 'Repeat . Decelerate immediately . Acknowledge . ' - I do not read . - Traeger , you 're under arrest . Your departure was unauthorised . Surrender or be destroyed . Then destroy me . I spent 15 years on your stinking planet and I 'll only go back in a box . Traeger out . For good . Come on , you old bucket . Get me through that stargate . Then you can quit . Break off pursuit and return to base . He could be a million parsecs away by now . You 'll do . Survey vessel . Attention . Attention , survey vessel . This is a priority blue distress code . Repeat , priority blue . My starboard defence shield and my stardrive are dead . Can you assist ? 'Starfighter , this is Capellan survey ship 077 . 'I 'm locking you in on a tractor beam . Prepare for docking . ' Buck 's been moping around for days . I 've done everything to get him out . I 'm afraid Twiki was right . He 's depressed about his birthday . I don 't understand . We all get older . He 's in better shape than a man half his age . There are no men half his age . His birthday is probably making him more homesick for the 20th century . Technically speaking , this birthday is his 534th . An unfortunate reminder of just how displaced in time he really is . Good evening , Theo . How are things on the front home ? - Home front . - Home front . Whatever . A message from Lieutenant Garth at Security Directorate . He 's coming over from the New Detroit Complex . He seems to think it 's quite urgent . Lieutenant Garth thinks everything is urgent . Every time they perceive the slightest hint of danger to my well being , they expect me to live behind a force field . Nonetheless , he should be here momentarily . Of course . Well , be that as it may ... what are we going to do about Buck ? Bidibidibidibidi . How about a surprise party ? That 's not a bad idea . A party will make him feel more a part of our world . Indeed it might . You know his friends . Why don 't you make the arrangements ? Yes . Let 's see , now . There 's um ... Jen , Joella ... Marla , Alison , Tangie , Felena , Miss Cosmos ... - There 's a pattern emerging here . - Apparently . - Mm . - ( Buzzer ) Lieutenant Garth has arrived . Let 's get this over with . A few days ago , this man , a Capellan captain , was found under restraint in the storage compartment of his ship in the New Detroit spaceport . He was delirious due to systemic poisoning . He remained alive for about 12 hours after he was found . As you may know , all Capellans are crude telepaths . He must have found out something he wasn 't supposed to know . The persons whose mind he read killed him for it . Most of what he said was unintelligible . But one thing was clear - whatever attacked him is also planning some sort of action against you . Who , Lieutenant ? Someone claiming to be the ship 's captain , who brought the vessel back to port and disappeared without a trace . We believe that he 's responsible for the real captain 's condition . What exactly is his condition ? He 's experienced a bizarre form of molecular transmutation . Half of his body has been changed to pure silicone . And what you 're afraid might happen to me is something like this ? Well , I sincerely appreciate your concern , but I hardly think the ravings of a delirious alien are cause for alarm . - Please ... - Now , let 's be reasonable . I don 't even know any Capellans . Why would one try to kill me ? - ' May I help you ? ' - I would like to see Dr Bayliss . - ' Do you have an appointment ? ' - No , but she would want to see me . 'I 'm sorry . The doctor 's schedule is full for the day . 'The earliest possible appointment is one week from tomorrow . ' - I 'm afraid that 's not convenient . - ' What do you think you 're doing ? ' 'This is Dr Bayliss . Please sit back . 'Take a deep breath , sit back and relax . 'Take a deep breath and relax . ' Doctor , I have a new job ... I 'm afraid to leave this planet ... I think it 's these dreams I 've been having . They depress me terribly . 'Do you want to go on with that , Miss Bennet ? ' Well ... In these dreams , my mother 's still alive . She 's always telling me I was an accident , that I surprised her and Daddy . What do you think that means ? Who are you ? How did you get in here ? Your reception quad has malfunctioned , Doctor . I took advantage of the opportunity . - Who are you ? - I 'm surprised , Delora . After all the time we 've spent together . Of course , it 's been a very long while . What are you talking about ? I 've never treated a Capellan in my life . And it 's Dr Bayliss , if you don 't mind . Traeger ? Cornel Traeger ? - But they said you were dead . - No . Almost , but not quite . Where have you been ? What brings you back here after all these years ? I had to see you , Delora . I need some information about an Elias Huer . He was with the Science Directorate , Space Exploration Division . He 's with Defense now . He 's in charge of the entire Directorate . Is he really ? Oh , that 's good . That 's really good . - What else ? - Corey , I don 't believe this . It 's been 15 years , not a word from you . After all , you were only a patient . I don 't have time to play games , so I won 't . You have quite a few patients in the government . Yes , but ... You can extract information from their minds without them knowing . Extortion . Is that it , Corey ? It 's obvious you didn 't come back for further treatment . All right . How much ? 5,000 ? 15,000 credits ? I spend that much in a week on incidentals . Here . It 's yours . If you forget we ever knew each other . Same old Delora . Always more interested in money that anything . I see you 've finally put your psych skills to more lucrative use . How nice . ( Sizzling ) That looks like andracite ! Diamonds ! Elysium ! There must be millions there , but how did you ... A little trick I picked up on Olvion . That 's where I 've been staying . Trick ? That 's nothing less than matter transmutation . Molecular reorganisation . Call it what you like . So long as you understand the implication . I can do the same to organic as well as inorganic material . We 'll be hiding in Buck 's apartment , he 'll come home , turn on the lights , and we 'll yell , " Surprise ! " Except he 'll find the complex swarming with Security Directorate agents . I don 't know why I ever agreed to this extra security . - You didn 't have a choice . - Yes . But it will undermine the surprise in Buck 's party . The Directorate guards are discreet . You will not see them , neither will Buck . Our problem is that we 've got to think of some way to keep Buck out of his apartment for two hours . Er ... It will thrive . All you need is the right kind of plant food . - I see . - Hi , Buck ! Wilma . Dr Huer . There 's a rumour about an attempt on your life . Is there anything I can do ? No , thank you . It 's being taken care of . The Security Directorate is handling it . We were just making up my itinerary for the next two weeks . It will be delivered this afternoon by an IAC . That 's an Inter-Agency Courier . Then they 'll deploy bodyguards to guard me round the clock . Corey , you 've changed . It 's not just the power . When I treated you as a patient , I thought I understood you thoroughly . - But you 're different . - Of course I 've changed ! No one could go through what I have and not be changed . And it 's all because of Elias Huer ! Shortly after I joined the Exploration Division , Huer sent me into space . " A routine space exploration mission , " he said . I was shot down over a planet no one ever heard of . There was a reason for that . The hostility of the natives to outworlders was frightening . They found me guilty of espionage . Locked me away . 12 kilometres below the surface . Eventually they forgot about me . You wonder why I wear these ? It 's because I 've lived without light for 15 years . - You can 't imagine that . - But you survived ! Yes ! Because I lived like an animal . I became like one of them . There must have been some natural element that gave them power . The Olvions could change things . Whatever they touched would become whatever they wanted it to be . After a few years on their world , I could do it too . And you used the power to escape . To come back . Yes , for my justice ! Is there any wonder that I would want that ? When I realise how full Huer 's life has been , and how really empty mine has been . All the years he stole from me . All right , I can change credits into gemstones , but I can 't change the past , nothing can do that . But I can change Huer 's future . I can take it away from him . And you are going to help me do it . - Miss Meritt . Right on schedule . - Reporting for briefing , sir . Raylyn Meritt , this is Buck Rogers . - How do you do ? - Hello . The mind-implantation procedure will take place at 1600 hours . After it is completed , you will go to the Security Directorate Headquarters . - Implantation ? - Captain Rogers is new here . Top-secret data is implanted directly into an IAC 's subconscious . When I arrive at my destination , Security extracts it from my mind . I never know the nature of the information . Which makes it very difficult to get out . Cute . - What is ? - I mean ... interesting . Er ... Buck . You said you wanted to help . Would you escort Miss Meritt to the New Detroit Complex to ensure her safe arrival ? I don 't think that 's necessary . I 've handled dozens of assignments . I know , but under the circumstances , it would make me more comfortable . If you insist . Excuse me . I 'll go prepare for the implantation . Do you know how to find the laboratory ? Buck , would you mind showing Miss Meritt the laboratory ? No , not at all , Doc . That was the sneakiest thing I have ever seen . Thank you . At least we know he won 't be in his apartment for a few hours . He may not show up at all . ( Delora ) ' You don 't actually expect me to help you kill Huer ? ' Need I remind you of my special abilities , Delora ? I can either kill you or make you very rich . The choice is yours . You 've already treated several key Directorate personnel . - You must know something . - He knows his life is in danger . But he doesn 't know you 're the danger . The Capellan captain lingered on longer than I 'd anticipated . - You 're certain of this ? - It comes from a very secure source . The Security Directorate is sending an IAC to pick up Huer 's itinerary . Once they get that , he 'll be guarded 24 hours a day . Actually ... that makes things simpler for us . You can 't get close to Huer , Corey , unless you know where to find him . And that 's exactly what will be in the head of the courier . 30 ? So ... these analysis chairs examine my patients ' conscious thoughts during a psych session . This one ... has been modified . This one examines the subconscious . - Like a psych probe ? - Not as sophisticated , not as fast . But it works on the same principle , yes . I can anticipate Huer 's every move . I can eliminate him at whatever time is most convenient . We can extract the information about his schedule from the IAC 's mind . - Just like the Security Directorate . - Exactly . Then all we have to do is intercept that courier . - Data for day 13 assimilated . - Let 's finish up , then . - Implantation completed . - Good , we 're finished . - You OK ? - I 've done this dozens of times . I certainly don 't need to be chaperoned by Captain Rogers . Just bring Buck back to his apartment when your assignment 's completed . It 's a favour to the Directorate - one for which we 'll pay you . - I 'm a government courier , not a . - That 's all we 're asking . Besides , I think you 'd enjoy Buck 's company . You used to work at the Earth Archives and you have an interest in history . - You should have a lot to discuss . - Captain Rogers is an historian ? Yes , in a manner of speaking . Let me explain . - All set . - Good . You 'll be escorted to the Security Directorate by two of their men - Marsden and Niles . They 'll contact you on the Federal Concourse at 1900 hours . They 'll identify themselves as Security Escort Detail . The code identification will be Blue-11 . - Any questions ? - No , sir . - After you , Miss Meritt . - Raylyn . We can make it to the Detroit Complex in time for dinner . You 'll love the restaurant . Did she agree to bring him back ? She was resistant at first , but once I explained why , talking her into it ... Was a piece of cake . Corey , these are my assistants , Rorvik and Carew . Cornel Traeger . My informant has confirmed the news . They 're sending Raylyn Meritt , an experienced courier . She 's due here in the complex within the hour . - Will she be a problem ? - Not for us . - Are you certain of your information ? - Corey , you worry too much . My man works in the communications office of the Security Directorate . He is totally reliable . You have your uniforms ? Good . - The men you are posing as ... - Niles and Marsden . We meet Meritt in the restaurant , escort her to the turbolift in the Federal building , and take her to the sublevel . Corey will meet you there . Excellent . Here are your synthaflesh masks . They duplicate Niles and Marsden 's faces exactly . If there 's nothing else ... Let 's get to work . You know , when Dr Huer first asked me to go along with you , you didn 't seem exactly thrilled . What changed your mind ? Before I joined the IAC corps I used to be a record keeper with the Archives . As you 're from the 20th century ... - You know about that ? - Colonel Deering told me about it . I 'm fascinated by that era . It seemed like such an exciting time . Prohibition , first moon landing , Milton Berle , Benny Goodfellow . - Man . Benny Goodman . - Oh . Those things happened at different times , most of them before I was born . I 'm told our records aren 't very accurate . I see . So that 's it . You just decided to pick my brains a little . Pick your brains ? Um ... get some first-hand information . Well , maybe at first , but ... you know . Yeah . You 're helping me get my head in a better place and for that I 'm grateful . It 's sweet of you to say that , but I don 't see that I 'm doing anything . Sure you are . Miss Meritt , Agents Marsden and Niles . We 're to escort you to Security . - Who 's he ? - I 'm just a friend . - We may be a while . - I 'm a slow eater . ( Huer ) ' They 'll identify themselves as Security Escort Detail . 'The identification code is Blue-11 . ' Wait . There was an identification code . Where 's your code disc ? - Who are you guys ? - Get her into the turbolift . She knew . Some guy she was with came after us . You should have been more careful . Did he follow you ? - I don 't know . - Be ready for him if he has . Hold it . They don 't make ' em like they used to . See ? No weapon . You want me , hero ? You come and get me . Just you and me . ( Lift whirrs ) Halt or I 'll shoot ! Oh , wow . Air 's kind of thick around here . Don 't move . Oh , great . - Get up slowly . - That 's the only way I can get up . I 'll just show you my ID . You 're with the Defense Directorate ? The card 's just in case someone asks questions . - And the woman was an IAC ? - Yes , she was . Those people are planning to kill Dr Huer . - How do you know ? - I 'm psychic . Call your head of security and tell them the courier has been intercepted . - One of them must have dropped it . - What is it ? - It 's a de-locking disc . - You mean a key ? You people always make things so complicated . Do you know what part of the complex it goes to ? That 's the Med Wing . Those numbers tell you what office . - 37042 . - That 's Dr Bayliss 's clinic . She 's a psych med . A lot of her patients are very important people . Information is in the subconscious , so they use a shrink to get it out . Shrink ? - I 'll get security up to the Med Wing . - Fine . I 'll meet them there . Sorry , but you 're not telling anybody anything . Your men are incompetent . That sublevel was crawling with security people . - What happened ? - I stopped one of them . - I didn 't have time to finish him off . - Rorvik and Carew can do that . If they check in . Our plans are in jeopardy . We 've got to move faster . How soon before you have something here ? It depends on her . It could be half an hour or longer . Your man in the information office . You can get him to forge a priority one communiqué , can 't you ? I suppose so . Then have him send a memo cancelling the blue code alert . " The assassin has been caught , Huer is safe . There 's no need for the IAC . " I 'll have him do it immediately . But they 'll suspect something has gone wrong sooner or later . Yes . But by then it will be too late . Particularly for Huer . - Colonel ... - The party favours ? Put them there . - Where do I put this , babe ? - Babe ? Thank you , Twiki . - Bidibidibidi . - I 'll take that as a compliment . Leave it right there . It will be the first thing Buck sees . What did you say these were ? Party favours . That 's what Dr Junius called them . He had the Manufacturing Centre make them up . I 'm almost afraid to ask , but what is this ? - A balloon . - Balloon ? Yeah . Watch . - ( Balloon squeals ) - Whoops . - See ? - Yes . I take it there 's some purpose in that . They 're for decorating . - And this ? - A party hat . A hat ? - You wear it on your head . - I most certainly will not . Oh , Dr Huer . There will soon be dozens of agents swarming through the building . If by some small chance an assassin does get into the building after me , I will not be murdered wearing a blue and white plastic cone on my head . Bidibidibidi . Party peeper . Party pooper ? I 'm not certain , but we probably have one of those here , too . - Um ... - ( Squeaks ) ( squeaks ) ( Bleeping ) - Yes , Carew . - ' Trouble , Doctor . 'The New Chicagoan that was with the courier is one of Huer 's people . ' - What did you do ? - ' There was nothing I could do . 'Doctor , he knows you 're in on this . 'I dropped my de-locking disc and he found it . 'A security agent told him about you . 'I took care of the agent , but that guy must be on his way . ' Find Rorvik and get back here as soon as you can . 'Right . ' Isn 't there some way you can speed up that process ? Not without causing extensive neural damage . What difference does that make ? You don 't think I 'm going to let her live ? There are alternatives . I could tamper with her memory . For God 's sake , Corey , I 'm no murderer ! No ? And I suppose you weren 't selling quadrillium when we first met on Regulus IV . How many people died of radiation poisoning back then ? That was different . Being an accessory to murder doesn 't bother you . It 's just the act itself you have no stomach for . Give it up , Corey . This whole thing is coming down around our ears . You 're going too far to settle an old score . I wish that 's all it was ! - The data 's coming in . - What 's happening ? Where 's Huer ? Spending the evening with friends in an apartment occupied by somebody named Rogers . William Anthony Rogers . The address is here . Whoa ! ( Sliding ) Nothing like dropping in on old friends , is there ? His eyes ! You 've blinded him ! He 's been underground for 15 years ! He can 't stand bright light ! Touch her and you die . Turn down the lights . It 's getting late . Huer 's waited long enough . - I want them dead . Understand ? - Yes . See to it . What are you doing ? You got what you want from her . Not entirely . This device has been adapted for sonic hypnosis . I can wipe out every memory she has of being intercepted and brought here . And substitute new ones . And then she thinks she 's done the job she was supposed to do . Mm-hm . Rather intelligent for a Neanderthal . - But Traeger said ... - Mr Rorvik . Any payment for the miserable job you two have done will come from me , not Traeger - remember that . - You 're hurting her . - She can 't feel it . But you don 't believe me , do you ? Well , you 'll find out for yourself . You 're next . Put him down over there . Start repairing your mask . You two are going out . Good news . The code blue alert 's been lifted . You 're safe . That is good news . But where 's Buck ? Maybe he convinced Raylyn that they should celebrate his birthday alone . But she agreed to bring him back here . She did , but Buck can be very persuasive . Ah , you 're awake . We 'll be ready for you in a minute . Where 's Raylyn ? Where she would be if things had gone as planned . - Thank you for your assistance . - Just doing our job . - I won 't remember you after this , will I ? - No . I guess I should say my goodbyes now . All his life , Corey has left a trail of corpses in his wake . - I don 't intend to add another . - That 's a comfort . Corey was a decent man once , but he 's changed . I 've got to get away from him . Off this planet . Start all over again . But first I have to cover my tracks , starting with you . And everything you know . I looked all over the restaurant for you . You said you were a slow eater . - You don 't remember a thing , do you ? - Remember what ? - What is going on ? - I 'll explain later . What 's the record flying time from here to New Chicago ? - No . Why ? - Whatever it is , we 're gonna break it . Can I have your attention ? Someone is on his way . Since the code blue alert has been cancelled , it must be Buck . So find your places and light the cake . ( All ) surprise ! - Who on earth is that ? - Bidibidibidi . Gatecrasher . - Hey ! - Oh ! My goodness ! ( All murmuring ) Traeger ! Cornel Traeger ! You 're alive ! Yes , Elias . Still alive . - Despite your best efforts . - What do you mean , my efforts ? You were lost on a routine mission . Everyone thought you were dead . Who sent me on the mission ? - Who ? - You volunteered . You knew the risks . Who do you think you are ? You have no right to disrupt this party . ( Traeger ) Stay out of this ! I 'm warning you . Next time I touch you ... ( Huer ) It was you . You killed that Capellan . And now me . That 's right , Elias . Now you . - Finally . - No , you don 't ! Dr Huer , Wilma , get away from him . ( Sizzling ) ( Wilma ) What happened ? ( Buck ) He fell on his own hand . ( Huer ) He 's pure silicone . Buck ! Buck , why did you take off so fast ? I was ... At the very least , Dr Bayliss will never practise psycho-medicine again . I suspect the Computer Council will find her guilty of of fences meriting a much more complicated correctional procedure . We have to contact the Adjudication Board , brief them on the rather bizarre details of this case . Colonel ? Don 't run off . I haven 't opened my presents yet . Happy Birthday . Even if things didn 't turn out the way we wanted . There 's an old saying . " It 's the thought that counts . " - It 's true . I appreciate it very much . - Maybe we 'll get it straight next year . After all that 's happened today , I could do without birthdays for a decade or two . - Let 's see what we got here . - What did you get ? Ahh .

Where is Dr. Montoya ? - Julian ? - Upstairs . Get the beds in the halls , away from the windows . Have you seen the number of people in here ? They think it 's a shelter . Where is Dr. Wallenberg ? She has radiological equipment . - What did you see ? - Why don 't we have emergency power ? There is no electricity . What did you see ? You came from Kansas City . What did you see ? I was on the freeway ... about 30 miles away . I am not sure ... lt was high in the air ... directly above downtown . Like the sun had exploded . Two suns ... lt was like ...

We tried hooking up an auxiliary bomb to a generator and we get nothing . I don 't understand . Did they burn out ? It can be P.E.M. effects . - What is that ? - Electro-magnetic pulse . When a large nuclear device air burst at high altitude ... a lot of electrical disruption can be created ... principally with radios , communication systems ... electrical wires , computers , cars , transistors . I read somewhere the batteries and fiber optics are supposed to work . It 's all theory . It 's never happened before . In short , very little electricity . Forever ? We have to find manual pump to get water . What about the fuel to boil the water , sterilize surgical instruments ? What about bringing in wood ? You can 't burn contaminated wood . It 'd put radiation back in the air . - What about bottled gas ? - There is butane for three days . - Bruce ! - Be quiet . What are you gonna do with that ?

How is Sedalia ? I said , how is Sedalia ? There is no Sedalia . And no Green Ridge , no Windsor , no nothing . 17 people died this morning . I would say that we are running a serious cholera risk . The morgue is full . Should we start using the garage ? Move the terminal radiation patients back to the rooms . I will talk to Joe Huxley about the RAD situation . We are very low on morphine , they have been stealing . They 're stealing food . Dr. Strayhorn had his wrist broken stopping a fight . Close the doors ! Don 't let anyone in .

 - Morning , sir . - Morning , Albert . ( DRUMMING ) ( SIGHS ) What 's all this noise ? ( COINS CHINKING ) Ah . I wish to take a room here . By the week . ( com JANGLES ) You er ... all right , Mrs Hall ? Quite all right , thank you , Teddy . Yes . Have you a guest parlour ? ( MRS HALL ) This way , sir . That 's right , just in here , sir . Here we are . Oh , a bit dark , isn 't it , sir ? Just get some Light on it . There we are . Bit of fresh air too . It 's a Lovely evening . There you are , sir . - This will do very well . - Oh . Thank you . Er ... may I take your hat and coat now , sir ? No , I prefer to keep my coat on . May I ask how long you 'll be staying , sir ? I Left some boxes at Bramblehurst station . How shall I have them brought here ? I 'll mention the matter to the postman , and the carrier will bring them over tomorrow . Tomorrow ? ls there no speedier delivery ? A man with a trap ? It 's a very steep road by the station , sir . It so happens , last year , a coach overturned . After dark , that is . - Very well . - The rubbish was everywhere , sir . - Everywhere ! All over the roads ... - I should like my supper now , please . - I intend to retire early . - Yes , sir . Very good , sir . I 'm sure we can arrange that . - Thank you . - Thank you . ( SIGHS ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) ( MAN ) Hello , young Silas . Whoa , there , jasper . Whoa , there . Mr Hall ! ( GROANS ) That 's right , Sandy . Yep . Well ... bye , Sandy . Go on , jasper . I tell you , I 'm gonna win this ! - Oh ! - That 's it ! ( LAUGHTER ) - Good evening to you . - Hello , Leslie . - Evening , Mr Hall . - How do , Teddy . You 've got a rum ' un stopping . - Eh ? - Rum-Looking customer . - In there . - Eh ? My sakes , Mr Hall . If the police were looking for him he couldn 't be more wrapped up . Who is he ? I 'd like to see a man 's face if he was stopping in my place . - What 's his name ? - He ain 't given one . He 's took a room , he 's not given no name ? - Women are that trusting , aren 't they ? - That stupid , you mean . - How Long 's he stopping ? - By the week . By the week ? We can 't get rid of him under a week ? Now , Listen here , Hall . You mind your own business and I 'll mind mine . Two sovereigns is two sovereigns , and he wasn 't no haggler , neither . Got his Luggage coming tomorrow . Let 's hope it won 't be stones in boxes . - Eh , we 'd best see about this , Jenny . - YOU 'LL see about nothing . My aunt in Hastings got swindled by a bloke with empty portmanteaus . - What 's he on about ? - Put stones in ' em . - See ? You don 't know everything . - Where you been , anyway ? - Oh , Sidderbridge . - Stopping a bit , by the smell of it . ( CLOCK TICKING ) Oh ! Upon my soul , sir , you gave me quite a shock . It 's the bandages , sir . Yes , bandages . Excuse me , sir . But accidents do happen though , don 't they ? And all in a moment , too . Oh , yes . But they takes long enough to get well , and that 's a fact . - If you leave the tray , I 'll put it out later . - Yes , very good , sir . Do that . Now , you take my sister 's son Torn , sir . He hurt his arm with a scythe . It happened in an hayfield , sir . And they kept him bandaged up for three months . Can you imagine ? Oh , I tell you . Gave me a fearful dread of the scythe . ( CHUCKLES ) Ah . There we are , sir . Bit gloomy in here , isn 't it ? Shall we get a bit more light ? ( SHOUTS ) No ! Leave the lamp where it is , please . Just as you like , sir . I thought you might like a bit more light , that 's all . My eyes are very weak . I am sometimes obliged to shut myself up in the dark for hours . Strong Light is a source of excruciating pain to me . ( MRS HALL ) I 'm sorry . I need this parlour for my own private use . It 's written on the door , sir . No one 's gonna disturb you . Nevertheless , I do not wish to be disturbed by anybody . Well ... I 'm sure that can be arranged . - Good night , sir . - Night . ( SNORING ) ( CLOCK CHIMES ) No , see , Look , he could be an achranist . - Oh , no ... Anichrist . - Make your mind up . - What 's that word ? - Oh , anarchist . Explosives . - Not in my parlour . He wouldn 't dare . - I don 't like the sound of him . - Looked Like a disguise to me . - I suppose I 'LL be dreaming of bogeys . Heads like great big white turnips . Ugh ! ( ROOM GRADUALLY FALLS SILENT ) Would you care to show me to my room , please ? Certainly , sir . If you would follow me , please . Poor soul 's probably had an operation or an accident or something . Them goggles ! Makes him look more like a diving helmet than a human man . Perhaps he 's hurt his mouth , as well . It 's a rummy case , Teddy . Let 's hope it won 't be stones in cases tomorrow . ( DOG WHINING AND YELPING ) All right , then . Push then pull it . - Push , man , go on . - ( MEN STRAINING ) Here ! Steady , there . Easy . There you go , then . - There 's a step there . - ( DOG BARKING ) In the corner . And take care not to upset it . They must be kept upright . No , no , no . In the corner ! Are you deaf ? - Gently . - ( RATTLING ) Great heavens ! For goodness ' sake , come along with those boxes . I 've been waiting for them long enough . - Hold it , hold it . - Steady , steady ! - ( SNARLING ) - Ow ! Get down , you brute ! - Was you bit , sir ? - Here , Teddy ! I 'm rare sorry about the dog , sir . It never broke the skin . Hurry up with those things . Bit , Mr Hall . Sandy 's dog bit him . Best go and see to him . - Why did he go and bite him for ? - How should I know ? - It ain 't right to have a dog like that . - I 'd shoot him , that 's what I 'd do . Listen , he 's got no right biting one of my guests like that . ( TEDDY ) Ar . Eh , I tell you something ... You ... you brute , you ! ( DOG WHINES ) - What 's all the commotion ? - The carrier 's dog 's bit him . - Who ? - Well , him . - Sir ? - You won 't find him in there . - Well , where is he , then ? - He 's gone upstairs . Oh ! ( TUTS ) - I never heard so much commotion ! - Sir ! - Sir ? - What is it ? - Well , was you hurt , sir ? - Not a bit . - He don 't want no help . - No , George , he should have a doctor . Go on . Er ... sir , Mrs Hall thinks ... The sooner you put my cases indoors , the better I 'll be pleased . Out of the road , Silas . Eh , eh . Here , I 'll tell you something . - Where is he ? - He 's upstairs . I was just telling Sandy , here . He 's black , that chap . - Black ? - Leastways , his legs is . - ( DOG BARKING ) - Black ? Here , ask him what he means . Teddy ! - Sh ! - I seen through a tear in his trousers . There weren 't no pink showing at all , just blackness . Don 't be so simple , Teddy Henfrey . Why , his nose is as pink as paint . - Well , his legs ain 't . - Here , he 's piebald . Black here , white there , in patches , like . - Oh , is he a kind of half-breed , you mean ? - Aye , that 's it . That 's why they 're wearing them there bandages . 'Cause the colours come off in patches . - I have heard of such things , Jenny . - Common enough with horses . Here , if he chose to show his self at fairs , he 'd make a fortune ! - A fortune ! - Sh ! Feeling better , sir ? Everything is safely off the wagon , sir . Arh ! Ach ! ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) ( MRS HALL ) Sir ? - ( KNOCKING ) - What is it ? Yes , yes , yes . Sir , the doctor 's come to take a look at your Leg . What ? Here . Here , what 's all this mess , eh ? - What have you done to my table ? - Put it down on the bill . Perhaps you could tell me what you consider a proper price. just look at my table ! - A shilling . Put down a shilling . - A shilling ? A shilling ? Eh ? A shilling ! And look at all this straw . There 's straw everywhere . I 've never seen so much straw in all my life . All over the floor ! This is not as I expected , sir . Surely a shilling is enough ? If there 's damage done , put it down on the bill . Pardon my intrusion . - Cuss . - What ? William Cuss . Dr Cuss , general practitioner for lping and Sidderbridge . The Landlord tells me that you were bitten by the carrier 's hound . - ( MRS HALL ) That 's right , sir . - It was nothing . Nothing at all . - ( HISSES ) I told you it was nothing ! - Excuse me , please , sir . My word ! You have a great many bottles here , Mr ... - Mr ... ? - I am extremely busy , Doctor . My dispensary can 't boast half as many bottles as this . Are you researching ? I am an experimental investigator and anxious to get on with my inquiries . I don 't mind telling you , all this arouses my professional interest . Please ... take care . A bad fire , was it ? I beg your pardon ? The bandages . Well , this is an ideal place to recuperate . My reason for coming to Iping was a desire for solitude . I must ask you to Leave , Dr Cuss . Even the unexpected entry of someone into a room could ruin an experiment . - Yes , of course , of course . ( COUGHS ) - Give it here ! Give it here ! Good Lord . How ... ? How can you move an empty sleeve ? - Empty sleeve ? - How did you keep it up ? I could see down the sleeve to the elbow . So it 's an empty sleeve , is it ? Well , that 's how I saw it , yes . Have another Look . Well ? Well , there 's nothing in it . I don 't understand . Is it glass ? ( SLAP ) ( LAUGHS ) - Well , Dr Cuss ? - Excuse me , Mrs Hall . - Excuse me . - I ... Oh ! It 's getting worse . ( KEY TURNS IN LOCK ) I know it sounds mad , but am I mad , Padre ? - Do I look insane ? - Perhaps a Little distracted . That Egyptian mummy , when he held up his arm , the one with nothing in it ... Oh , it 's too ridiculous ! But something like a finger and thumb nipped the end of my nose . - ( SNORTS ) - But , damn it , there was nothing there ! A most remarkable story , William . Something tweaked your nose , you say . You can 't imagine what the fellow looks like . But I have seen him . I must confess , he is a rather daunting spectacle . And a disagreeable one ! He calls himself an experimental investigator . - Do you have reason to doubt him ? - Well , there are bottles and chemicals . It looks more like a laboratory than an inn 's parlour . - Is he a doctor , perhaps ? - No name given . He arrived last night and took rooms in the Coach and Horses . I don 't mind telling you , Edward , it 's put me in a blue funk . Perhaps if I were to have a word with this gentleman ? You 'd fare no better , I guarantee it . There 's something unapproachable about the fellow , something dangerous . ( WOMAN LAUGHING ) ( MAN ) You be one of the best girls in this village . ( WOMAN GIGGLES ) - You be one of the best girls on this river-bank . - ( GIGGLES ) ( MOANING AND SIGHING ) - ( COUGHING ) - What 's that ? - It 's only a fox or something . - Foxes don 't cough . - Course they do ! All the time ! - Oh , you ! - I 've heard a fox cough often . - Blew his nose , too , did he ? Oh ! Right , now that does it . Come here ! Come here ! - Eh ! - You won 't catch me ! Ooh ! You wait ! That 's all your fault . I talk to you about foxes coughing ... Come here . ( BUZZ OF CONVERSATION ) For the damage I have done to your furniture . If it 's not sufficient , put it on the bill . That will be most satisfactory , sir , thank you . - Good evening . - Good evening , sir . I am obliged to send away to London for certain scientific journals - but can find no post office in the village . - Oh , no . - The nearest post office is at Bramblehurst . - Yes . But the postman , he does call here , every morning round nineish . Perhaps you 'd inform him tomorrow that I wish to entrust him with a registered Letter . Right . Very good , sir . - ( MRS HALL ) Evening , sir . - Evening . - George , look at this ! - Sinister 's right ! God , I 've never seen a more sinister-looking cove . Well , his manner may be a bit overbearing , but if he 's to give me a shilling every time he scratches my furniture , who cares ? Bills regular paid is bills regular paid . Well , I don 't like it , Janny . I 'd rather he kept his money and moved on . - Whoo ! - Mr Hall ! Just a minute , Sandy . Here , how do we know what he 's up to in there ? - And suppose he 's not right in the head . - Oh , George ! I 'm telling you straight , he 's going to be trouble , that one . God ! We 'll all end up with our throats cut . - Sandy , what 's that ? Do you want a ... ? - Please .

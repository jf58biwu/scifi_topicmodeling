 Nam left without having breakfast , so I made rice balls for him . Monga , do you want some ? I can 't get over how funny your face looks . Oh , I shouldn 't have said that . Sorry , Monga . Don 't feel gloomy , Monga . What ? It really is getting gloomy ! Something 's coming ! Monga ! Thank you , Monga . Are you all right ? We 're not catching up with it at all . The lnorganics will take it if we don 't hurry up . Shut up ! I wouldn 't have lived three hundred years if I was afraid of Inorganics . It 's my turn to clean the ship this week . Where 's your sense of adventure ? If we get SHADE , and sell it to the surviving guerillas , we won 't have to work ever again ! But the lnorganics must also have sensed the appearance of SHADE . They may already be here in the Rido Galaxy . So what ? For that treasure , I ' d even fight against the Inorganics ! I am the great Space Merchant , Mr. Bao Luzen ! You are amazing , Mr. Bao Luzen . I will say goodbye to this filthy life . I have a dream which I cannot tell to anyone . Rasa , my love , aren 't I a great adventurer , Rasa , my little sweetie pie ? Pay Attention , Bao . SHADE is getting away . What ? ! Oh , no ! My treasure ! My adventure ! My glorious future ! My SHADE ! Bao , don 't be illogical . What ? ! What 's illogical about it ? This is no time for fooling around ! Feed the furnace ! Max power , five hundred percent ! Turn on the turbo charger ! It 's on . Hey , there it is ! I knew this ship was fast ! You 're right , Bao . Oh , no ! It 's gone . Wow , that SHADE is really something . We won 't be able to catch it with this run-down ship . Idiot ! We need to warp ! Let 's warp ! Warp ? This ship doesn 't have a warp device . Don 't underestimate me , Kim . I secretly equipped this ship with a warp device for a time like this . Wow ! You 're really amazing , Bao ! Three , two , one . Start the warp engine ! Isn 't it great ! ? Yeah , it 's great . Let 's go ! Yes , Sir ! Warp completed ! All green ! Warp distance traveled is 527 meters . Oh , that was close . I thought it would be at least 600 meters . One more time ! Start the warp engine ! Kim , we 're friends , right ? Yes . We 've known each other a long time , right ? Yes . Don 't tell any one about this , okay ? Okay . Here goes . Is this some sort of haunted house ? It 's a woman . I 'm not a ghost . Call me Arlia . She said her name was Arlia . It 's a sword . That one eye ... Could it be an Inorganic ? Hey , it 's a girl . That 's a floater-bike she 's riding . She 's pretty ugly . " Even if a woman looks smart , she cannot sell a cow . " She thinks she can drive just because she passed the written test . Jiggly-butt ! Man , I can 't wait any longer . Let 's go and show off how powerful our Inorganic bikes are . Ready , guys ? GO ! Ouch ! His engine stalled again . Follow me ! " One needs a companion in travel , and sympathy in life . " Inorganics ! I 'll show her my secret weapon . Soldier Sprinkle Spikes , fire ! It 's not working ! Here 's another secret weapon . Inorganic Oil ! Is he stupid ? Yeah , he 's the mayor of Stupid Town . That 's weird . Where did they go ? That was a one-way street . I even have a motorcycle license . I 'm a goner ! Name and Date of Birth : Nikujirou , 1963 , August Permanent Address : Rido Galaxy , Aqualoid 1 - 7 - 7 , Kaname Apartment lssue Date : 1984 , July 21 Expires on Date of Birth 1 986 Restrictions : Eye Glasses Driver 's License Number : 308051 494220 I 'm a goner ! Everyone , it 's lunch time . Eat a lot . There 's more so don 't fight . Here 's some for you too . Where did Nam go without eating his breakfast ? Well , I don 't know . Looks like Rasa went out to find him . Oh , thanks . Nam is older now and he shouldn 't be fooling around . How good this tea smells . It 's freshly picked tea . They started harvesting the crops yesterday . Oh , I see . It 's already that time of year . Hey , lady ! Let me come with you . Don 't you think this motorcycle looks cool ? I remodeled it myself . Hey , lady ! Do you wanna go somewhere nice with me ? Why don 't we go and have some soy milk ? And we can go to a disco and have fun ! Hey , hey ! Look this way ! Don 't be such a snob ! You ugly bitch ! Boy , kids these days don 't know how to speak properly . That bitch ignored me ! I 'm a handsome boy full of dreams , hope and love ! Wait ! We can start a new love in this season of sprouting leaves . And the warm spring is ... Hey , guys ! Play with me . I 'm not a little kid . I 'm serious ! Wait for me ! Hey , let 's try exceeding the speed of sound . No one pays attention to me . I 'm alone . I 'm all alone . Danger ! Don 't Pass Under ! Trains ! Caution ! The blue sky ? The blue sky ? I hate the blue sky ! YOU JERKS ! Who are you calling a jerk ? ! Sorry . Idiot ! Sorry ! Stupid ! Sorry ! Idiot ! Hey , Jiggly-butt , what 's up with you ? You 're pretty fast ! Left Right Up Yeah , there ! OK Ah ! He 's out of ammo . Nam ! Nam ! Rasa ! Rasa ! Monga ! You 're the greatest ! You did it ! Nam , you left without having breakfast . I brought it all this way for you . Thanks , Rasa . You 're the best ! Oh , I forgot about them . The Inorganics again ! Mr. Mid-life Crisis here never quits ! It 's that sword ! All right , I 'll fight with this sword . You 'll fall unless you hold onto me . This is no time to worry about that ! Keep it steady ! I always drive steady . Nam ! He 's so clumsy . Nam ! Hey , Jiggly-butt ! What is it , Mr. Mid-life Crisis ! ? " No matter how hard I work , my life doesn 't get any easier . " " ln the sound of Gion Vihara 's bell , I hear the impermanence of all material existences of this world . " " All living things die and the people you meet leave you . " Boy , she 's dumb . I can tell she 's gonna turn right . Hey , you tricked a grown man ! You 're a naughty girl ! Oh , I 'm so tired . He 's relentless , isn 't he , Monga ? I heard that the lnorganics were dangerous , but I didn 't know there were stupid ones , like this guy . There you are , Jiggly-butt . Here goes ! Oh ! That was impressive , Jiggly-butt . You can do some amazing things . You win . I 'm going home . Rasa ! Bao ! Rasa ! Rasa , you 're okay . I 'm glad ! I , Bao , will protect you ! It 's all right now . Cut it out ! A middle-aged man 's romance , how sad . You try this too , Grandma . What do you think ? It has a nice aroma and tastes good , doesn 't it ? But this goes good with alcohol . It wouldn 't go well with meals . Really ? You think so ? I see , so this is SHADE . Oh , I see , Nam . You found it for me . Thanks . I was looking for it under orders from the Star Military . Let me have it so I can take it back to them . Yeah , right . I know you 're going to sell it to them for a hefty price . Why don 't you give it to him ? The lnorganics are attacking you because you have that sword . But the person who has SHADE can become very strong , just like the Zach soldiers , who were interplanetary fighters . Nam , that 's a joke . It 's just a fantasy or fairy tale . The Star Military believe it but they have no evidence . No , that 's not true . I saw a mysterious woman with this sword earlier . What ? A woman ? Stupid ! Rasa , no , I was just kidding . Nam , what do you mean you saw a woman ? Yeah , she was really pretty . She also seemed very intelligent and very mature . Rasa , what 's the matter ? Rasa ! Don 't Touch ! Being a guy isn 't easy . It 's that pretty woman from before ! What ? Pretty woman ? Wow , you 're right ! She is pretty . Who is she , Nam ? Introduce her to me . Bao , you 're blind when it comes to women . Is that so ? You think I 'm blind ? Like this ? You 're Arlia , right ? Is this the mature woman you were talking about ? Just who are you anyway ? ! None of you have yet realized that the universe itself is a life form , and it is currently still in an embryonic state . When the universe is filled with the lives of you Organics , it will be reborn and evolve to the next stage . However , the inorganic life pattern accidentally emerged . It is something that will destroy the universe . Like a cancer . The Inorganics exist only to multiply and destroy Organics . But still , the Inorganics are also something created by the universe . It may be an obstacle that the universe intentionally created . SHADE contains a great amount of crystallized life energy , within which many consciousnesses are stored . They will merge into one enormous consciousness . This is the consciousness of the universe , the great energy that will destroy the Inorganic life patterns . I felt like we flew around the universe . I saw ... I saw a star die . Rasa ... Where did that lady go ? She 's such a mysterious person . She 's like the wind . That Arlia person ... I wonder if she is a Star Princess ? What the heck ? Oh , it 's just a mole . That scared me ! Tomato ! Asparagus ! Radish sprouts ! Wow ! I wonder if he 's also an inorganic ? That 's my guess . Green Pepper ! Potato ! Melon ! Raisin ! Eggplant ! Spinach ! Rasa ! Oh , no ! Rasa ! Cauliflower ! Papaya ! What are you doing to my Rasa ? ! Peanuts ! Bao , he looks like a tough one . But Rasa is ... Rasa is ... Bao , he looks like a tough one . But Rasa is ... Rasa is ... You bastard ! You 'll pay if you hurt her ! Nerima Radish ! I 'm getting sleepy . Prohibited area ? No , we can 't go there . Grandpa told me to stay away because it 's radioactive . Are you talking about the inorganic War two hundred years ago ? It should be okay by now . When you consider the half-life , the area should be at a safe level . I doubt even the Inorganics would follow us there . Leave it to me ! Oh , Rasa , your Pony 7 has passed its inspection . Why don 't you ride on it and follow us ? Great ! My floater-bike got wrecked and I didn 't know what to do . Hey , Rasa , let me drive this time . Nam , you don 't have a license , remember ? You like this stuff ? Man , you 're behind the times . It 's my spirit of adventure ! An Inorganic ! I didn 't expect to see them here . Leave it to my Pony 7 ! Rasa , he 's dangerous ! Make a U-turn . We 'll follow her ! You must be kidding , Bao ! Shut up and go ! Rasa , don 't be reckless . We don 't have any choice ! Don 't worry about it ! Speed up ! Yeah ! That 'll teach ya ! You bastard ! Leave Rasa alone ! Let 's go right through ! We made it through ! You slowpoke ! There must be an entrance to the underground city up ahead . We should go into the city before they find us again . As a soldier , I used to fight here so I 'm familiar with the area . Go faster ! Full speed ahead ! This is the fastest we can go ! There it is ! That 's the entrance ! It 's a black ball ! A black ball 's coming ! Take that ! Man , he 's tough . So this is the underground city . I wonder where Bao and Kim went ? They 're merchants . I bet they 're looking for something they can sell . Shouldn 't we go join Nam and Rasa ? That 's okay . There 's something I 'm looking for right now . Looking for ? Have you heard of the Dongemaharu ? Dongemaharu ? It 's the ultimate weapon made to fight against the Inorganics . It changes all molecules to plasma . I see . Did you guys use it ? No , we couldn 't use it . Its power was too strong . It 's that powerful , then ? The bomb itself is small , but once it explodes , it causes a chain reaction , and the entire planet turns to plasma . So even if we have it , we can 't use it without destroying the planet . That 's why we were planning to take it to the Inorganic home planet and detonate it there . But this place was destroyed in a nuclear attack before we could . I see . You want to find it and charge the Star Military a ton . You figured me out ! Cool , it works ! What are you going to do ? I 'm going to take a look around . I 'm hoping I can find some weapons . It 's dangerous to go alone . Take me with you ! Don 't worry . Wait for me here . He 's reckless , isn 't he ? Have you seen the Dongemaharu ? Yeah , although it was just a prototype . So where is it ? Of course , it 's in the military facility . Ah , of course ! You 're great , Bao . Nam ! Nam , where are you ? C 'mon , you big gas tank ! Let 's go , go , go , go ! Looks like we threw him off track . Kim , you 're the best ! Wow , Rasa , you 're okay ! Look out behind you ! You bastard ! Bao ! Are you alright , Bao ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Damn ! That damn one-eyed monster ! That was close ! Nam ... Ouch , the wound I got earlier ... Looks like a military facility . I wonder if something 's in there ? Oh , it 's a dead end . What 's that ? All right , I 'll check it out ! Oh , no , it 's gone ! Rasa ! Rasa , use the choke and throttle . Rev up the accelerator ! Bao , I can 't pull the lever . I 'm falling ! No , Rasa , prepare it for landing . Of course ! Oh , yeah , of course , of course ! Yes ! You did it , Rasa ! He 's here ! Let 's go , let 's go ! Full speed ! Roger ! Nam , where are you ! ? Say something if you can hear me ! I haven 't seen a weapon like this before . Maybe I 'll take a chance and try it out on that monster . Okay , then ... Blast it ! I can 't find the right timing . Then I 'll shoot him from here . Look , Bao ! Nam ! Hey ! That 's the Dongemaharu ! No kidding ! Nam , don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! Nam , stop it ! Bao ! What are you trying to do ? ! You can 't use it ! This weapon is that powerful ? Yes , it is . It can easily destroy the whole planet . It 's getting dangerous in here too ! Let 's go outside . Sounds good . Here they come ! Red , blue and green earlier . For monsters , they sure are colorful ! Watch out ! Here they come ! Bao ! Stop ! Don 't come this way ! Go away ! Oh , that 's right ! Bao ! It itches ! Bao ! Don 't die ! Damn ! It 's useless , Nam ! Stop it , Nam ! Oh , no ! Let 's go , Monga ! Monga ! What are you doing , Rasa ! Stop it ! Rasa ! You did it , Rasa ! Way to go ! Rasa ! Rasa ! Bao , I won 't let you die ! I 've always liked you ! Kim ! Kim ! Oh , no ! Rasa ! Rasa ! Give me the strength ! Dammit ! Rasa ! Don 't die , Rasa ! Bao , thank you ! What 's with them ? They stopped shooting at us . Looks like there 's a storm brewing . Did you bring the laundry in ? Oh , I didn 't . That 's ... A moon-sized Inorganic ! Oh ! It 's an earthquake . Grandma , put out the fire ! Yes , dear . Right , you need to be careful of fire when there 's an earthquake . I think they 're going to destroy Aqualoid itself ! Oh , no ! Oh , no ! I don 't want to die so young ! Hey , wait for me ! Take me with you ! Don 't abandon me ! Why ? I 'm one of you ! I 'm also an Inorganic ! Okay , then ! I don 't care ! You all made fun of me ! Give it to me . I 'll destroy it with this ! Idiot ! Do you want to destroy Aqualoid as well ? But if we don 't do anything ... Everyone ! I hate everyone ! I hate you all the most ! Don 't ! Don 't use it ! If you use it , something really bad will happen ! You were about to use it a minute ago , Nam . Hey , Inorganic kid ! Let 's talk about this . Shut up ! You grown ups can 't trick me any more . I 'll destroy this stupid world ! Calm down . Why don 't we go out for some soybean milk ? Oh , really ? You ignored me earlier ! I ... I ... I HATE WOMEN !

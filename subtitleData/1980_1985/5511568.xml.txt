 Thanks for stopping . You 're the first person I 've seen in days . Are you nuts ? This is Visitor territory out here . I know . I was up in Santa Cruz when they attacked . I 've been trying to get back to my father 's ranch ever since . A ranch ? Where ? It 's right outside Mount Wilson . It 's not far from here . I don 't know , 5 miles as the crow flies . Wilson ? That 's more like 25 if you stick to the road . Come on . Put this on . - Lf it 's out of your way ... - No , forget it . By the way , I 'm Kyle Bates . Robin Maxwell . Nice to meet you , Robin . - What about the road ? - I thought you said you wanted to fly . It 's not much farther now . Why are we stopping ? The ranch is up ahead . Wait a minute . Wait here . I 'm gonna check it out . Easy . Don 't try to say anything . No time . Club Creole , Main Street . Take the pouch to the fireman . What happened to the courier ? His body was found , but not the pouch he was carrying . Are you sure he was from the World Liberation Front ? We 've monitored all transmissions between the Resistance in LA ... and the WLF in New York . It 's clear they intend to move Elizabeth within the next two weeks . This courier was to have brought the precise details . Unless he was a decoy . Begging your pardon , but when our patrol reached the courier ... - there was another rider there . - Another ? Who ? - Positive identification was impossible ... - Impossible ? - Why wasn 't he brought for interrogation ? - He escaped . However , from the description ... it is possible to believe he was Nathan Bates ' son . How intriguing . Why wasn 't I informed of this earlier ? I felt you had more important matters to deal with . I appreciate your concern , Lydia , dear . But in the future , let me decide what is important . - You still want us to go after Elizabeth ? - The child is a hybrid ... the only product of our successful mating with the humans . Her genes contain information that could help us end the war in weeks . And make you the conquering hero . How perceptive . Order a transport . I think it 's time that I spoke with Nathan Bates . What about Donovan 's son ? Sean , how would you like to see your father ? Leave my father alone . Have him prepared and brought to the embassy . The drug seems to be wearing off . Give him another injection of procorb . I may have some work for him . You were wonderful ! I really thought they had us again . Aren 't you staying ? WLF . Does that mean anything ? It 's gotta be pretty important to be worth dying for . I 'd better check it out . Why don 't you stay here in case things get tight , okay ? Look , I know you 're worried about your daughter . But after this morning , it 's certain she 's not at your father 's ranch . She 's just such a little girl . And we 're going to find her , I promise . Okay ? Be careful . You know me . I don 't believe it . The eggs cost more than the souffl√© . Boss , there is a strangler at the door . - You mean a stranger , right ? - That is right . A stranger . He says he 's looking to burn someone . The guy who gave me this didn 't make it . He said to get it to the fireman . It 's got this address on it , but this doesn 't look too much like a firehouse . Look , who invited you , anyway ? Hey , don 't come unstrung . - I guess I just got the wrong spot . - Guess again . The party 's just getting started . Let 's take a seat . - What 's your name ? - Kyle Bates . I used to work for a man named Nathan Bates . Ever heard of him ? Maybe . What 's it to you ? He sold us out to the lizards , and I don 't like him . Well , at least we agree on one thing . What 's he to you ? My father . The World Liberation Front seal is on it . Where 's the message ? I ate it . How do I know you 're the guys I should give it to ? - I 'll stand on your neck if you don 't . - And you don 't want that . Well , I guess I 'm not ready to die for the cause . Looks like the code . Lock up the place , and keep him here till I get back . Humans have such primordial taste in art , Mr. Bates . Surely you didn 't come here to lecture me on aesthetics , Diana . Or is there some refinement to your personality ... that I 'm missing ? Actually I came on two accounts . First , to thank you for giving us back our embassy . In the interest of peace ... it 's always good to keep the channels of communication open . What was the second reason ? It 's come to my attention that your son is perhaps aiding the Resistance . I 've told you before that I cannot be held responsible for my son 's actions . He has a mind of his own . Then , in the interest of peace , I suggest you make certain ... that he doesn 't become a Brakal . I 've never heard of a Brakal ... but I 'd bet my bottom dollar you 're about to explain it to me . On our planet , Mr. Bates ... a Brakal is a creature so mesmerized by fire ... that it eventually consumes him . - Meaning ? - Meaning we agreed on an Open City . The Resistance threatens that agreement . If your son were to join the Resistance ... I couldn 't possibly guarantee his safety . I see . After I finish redecorating the embassy ... I 'll throw a small party for some of our friends . One last thing . Since you 're so concerned with peace ... don 't bug my office . I might misinterpret your intentions . You shouldn 't have come here . Bates can walk in anytime . I know . I don 't have any choice . We gotta get this thing decoded right away . - Here it is . - What ? " Rendezvous , China Flats ... " 1300 hours , Friday . " Friday ? That means we only have 48 hours . China Flats . That 's 35 miles north of here . I 'm not so sure sending Elizabeth to New York is a very good idea . With Robin missing , we 're the only people that she really knows . Red Dust is still active in New York . She needn 't worry about Diana there . - What 's that ? - Bates . Julie , could you come in here a minute , please ? Yes , Nathan . I 'll be right there . Mind if I ask you a question ? Aren 't you one of them ? I thought the Visitors only ate live meat . That is correct . But I am a veterinarian . We will open soon , so I must change . Leave your plate . I 'll bust it later . Going somewhere , buddy ? - That girl . - Girl ? What girl ? I didn 't see any girl . I don 't see anybody here but me and you . I just talked to Donovan . He said you could go on one condition : You keep your mouth shut about this place and us . You understand ? I wouldn 't even recommend the food . I want my portrait hung there . That seems rather human of you , don 't you think , Diana ? You haven 't been fighting this war as long as I have . I want the humans to know who 's in charge when they come here . Whatever you like . How is the special interrogation room coming ? The holographic synthesizers will be installed before nightfall . - Although I still don 't see the rush . - You will . - You have your orders . - We will be back before dark . The boy will see to that . Good hunting , Captain . Dad , you 're awake ! - What hit me ? - You don 't remember , do you ? These blackouts . Ever since the war ended , you haven 't been the same . Ended ? The war is over ? - Have the Visitors left ? - Yes , almost a year now . Thank God you persuaded me to let Elizabeth go to New York ... - and work with the Liberation Front . - Lf she hadn 't helped them ... they couldn 't have perfected the neutron oscillator . The what ? The weapon we used to beat them . Mike , it 's happening again . Call Dr. Harmon . Tell him your dad 's awake , but he 's having another relapse . - Wait a minute ... - Don 't move . It 'll just make things worse . Don 't worry , you 'll get your memory back . We have to go to Ham Tyler 's wedding tomorrow . Wedding ? Tyler ? Who 'd marry him ? Mike , you 're his best man . You 're kidding . I must check my appointment calendar . I couldn 't reach the doctor , so I left a message . Okay , fine . Why don 't you stay with your father while I go run some errands ? You two can talk baseball . I 'll stop back later with something to eat . I make a most convincing Julie , don 't I ? Very impressive . I must confess a certain skepticism in all this machinery . State-of-the-art holographic generators ... plus 200 cc 's of contramine . Donovan 's convinced he 's in his own bedroom . Unless , of course , he tries to go outside . The drug will prevent him from getting out of bed for at least 24 hours . By then he will have told us every detail of the Star-child 's rendezvous . He 'd better . A second dose of contramine would kill him . Dear Lydia , always so negative . If you need to enter the room , slip one of these around your neck . The holographic generator has been programmed ... so you appear to be someone he knows . Personally , I prefer old-fashioned torture . At least you had some fun . Fun is all in the knowing how . Meanwhile , why not send someone for Donovan 's appointment calendar ... in case he asks for it again . Okay , I 've got your fake birth certificate and your driver 's license . This is very important . Until you get to New York ... you 'll be traveling under the name Elizabeth Dunne . Have I done something wrong ? Wrong ? Sweetheart , no . We just want you to go where it 's safe . New York ? - But I don 't know anyone there . - You will . I promise you ... when we find your mother , she 'll join you . And you ? I can 't go with you . I have to stay here and fight for peace . What a confusing world . Fight for peace . Isn 't that a contradiction ? Yeah , it sure is . There are a lot of contradictions in this world . I bet it 's really difficult for you . Someday am I gonna have to fight for peace ? I hope not . - Julie , excuse . - Yeah . They have need for you upstairs . Okay , listen . If you like , I 'll go with you to the plane tomorrow , okay ? Yes , I 'd like that . Good luck , sweetheart . Afraid ? Everything is so strange and new . It is a very strange world . It 's not just this place , it 's me . Like yesterday , there was this boy . We touched , only for a moment ... but I can 't forget how it made me feel . All frightened and excited at the same time . Yes , I have had those feelings for a human , too . - You must be careful . - Why ? Human love can sometimes be very painful . I must go now . Thank you . How 's it look ? Nothing a new transmission or engine wouldn 't fix . - Have you heard from Donovan ? - Not since yesterday . Why ? Julie says nobody 's seen him since last night . He was supposed to get extra cars . Maybe it took longer than expected . Yeah , I guess you 're right . How many changes are we gonna need ? At least two : One at Griffith Park , and one in the Hollywood Hills . That means we 'll have to get past Bates ' checkpoint in Cahuenga Pass . The police are checking everyone for Resistance people . Get in and turn it over . What 's this " we " ? - I 'm going with you . - Won 't that blow your cover ? I don 't have any choice . Elizabeth trusts me . I won 't let her down . Even if you have to jeopardize the Resistance ? Whatever it takes . Funny , you always said put the cause in front of the individual . What are you doing back here ? I thought it over . You guys look like you could use some help . Dude , I told you , we don 't want any , all right ? Checked the distributor ? Actually , there was this girl that I saw here yesterday ... Look , man , I told you . We don 't want any . Suit yourself . Wait a minute . Can you find two more like that ... and meet me at the Mulholland cut-off at noon tomorrow ? Maybe . Why ? I thought I 'd show you how to ride , smart guy . You 're on , old man . Just be there . What , are you crazy , man ? He 's asking about Elizabeth . He 's asking about some girl . When he realizes she 's Elizabeth , she 'll be in New York . - Besides , we need him . - What for ? Rule to live by : Never go anywhere without Plan B. - So where are you going ? - To check on Donovan . Don 't let Julie talk you into anything till I get back . I 'm glad you 're awake . I thought we could share a bite . Thanks , but I 'm afraid I 'm not very hungry . How are you going to get better if you don 't eat ? I don 't know . You know , I was just thinking how peaceful it is . It 's hard to get used to the war being over . It seems so sudden to me . Funny , that 's exactly what you said the last time this happened . I 'm sorry , that must have been pretty rough on you . Sean 's been a big help . I 'm glad . About the last thing I remember ... was Sean ... just before these Visitors grabbed me . You mean , you don 't remember getting Elizabeth to New York ? I remember planning the rendezvous ... the time , the place . I 'll never forget that Saturday . What 's this ? You 're married ? You 're not getting out of it that easily . We 're married . - We ? - Yes . - When ? - Right after the war . That 's terrific , and I don 't remember a thing . You 're gonna have to fill me in on the details . First let 's have a piece of pastry . Sean went out especially . Maybe later . Disgusting . But how do you know they 've got him ? All I know is what happened when I got to Donovan 's . Do you have any idea where they could have taken him ? The lizard I found there wasn 't much on small talk . Why don 't you go find Donovan , and I 'll take the kid to the chopper . No , I promised her . She 's been let down by too many people already . You better get a move on to make that rendezvous . The van 's in the alley and gassed . Let 's go . I 'll never forget you both . Neither will we . Good purchase . Goodbye , Willie . Morning , Dad . Julie said you were having breakfast . Thought I 'd bring you the paper . Thanks , kiddo . The way my head feels this morning , I 'm not up to much reading . Yeah , that 's okay . I was hoping we 'd get a chance to talk , anyway . There 's an article on the front page about Elizabeth . It makes it sound like she won the war single-handedly . That sounds like you don 't believe it . - Maybe I just know the truth . - Really ? And what is the truth ? That if you hadn 't gotten her to the rendezvous that day ... she could 've never done a thing . It was a war , son . Everybody had to do a part . I just wanted to let you know that I know you were the real hero , Dad . Thanks , kiddo . Just hearing that from you makes me feel good . One thing I never figured out , though . How did the Liberation Front tell you where they 'd pick her up ... without Diana ever finding out ? We decoded a secret message sent by courier and the rest was easy . Yeah ? What did it say ? That 's funny . I can 't remember what happened yesterday , but I remember that message . " Rendezvous chopper , China Flats ... " 1300 hours , Friday . " Hey , I wouldn 't worry . It 'll all come back soon . I 've got to go run an errand for Julie . - I 'll see you later . - Okay . It looks like a pretty nice day out . Maybe later , we can get together and play some catch . Yeah , sure . As soon as I get back . Papers . There you go . Science Frontiers ? You want to step out and let me see what 's in back ? Check the pass , pal . That 's top priority . I 've got orders to deliver to Bates himself . You 've got orders and I 've got orders . Let 's not make life tougher than it already is . I 've got to see what 's in back . Come on , out . Come on , let 's go ! I still don 't understand why I can 't come with you . I told you before , I 'm not sure what I 've gotten myself into . Then why go ? I said I would . Look , Robin , I know it 's tough losing your little girl . But we 're gonna find her . It 's just a matter of time . It 's just that right now I 've got some things that I 've got to do . All right ? All right . Who 's that ? My father . Why don 't you go inside ? I see you have company . You might at least introduce me to your lady friend . Well , that 's all right . I was the same way when I was your age . Nice tie . Kind of matches Diana 's eyes . I see you haven 't changed your opinion of the deal I struck . - I call them like I see them . - I did it for you , you know . No , you did what you did for a lot of reasons ... the same reasons you 've always done things your way : Business , brinksmanship , and bucks . The three " B " s . Kyle begins with a " K , " remember , Dad ? So don 't pin this one on me . You think you 'd be living here lizard-free , if it wasn 't for the Open City deal ? Lizard-free . What an interesting idea . - Too bad it doesn 't really apply . - Of course it does . For 50 square miles within the confines of Los Angeles . In case you hadn 't noticed , Dad , LA is crawling with Visitors . They come and go as they please . That 's the bargain . - But they leave us in peace . - For now ... while they chow down on the rest of the planet . Kyle , let me tell you something . We both know there 's a free world out there , fighting for its life . God knows where we 'd all be without the Red Dust keeping them at bay . I 'm just trying to bide a little time till I find a way to win this war . But I can 't do that if the peace is constantly jeopardized ... by groups of dissidents , like the Resistance . Great . You buy time your way , I 'll buy time mine . Then you 're with the Resistance ? I didn 't say that . Where are you going ? To test the bikes . Call Headquarters . I want a house-to-house of the entire area . This is Grid 13 , from Point Street bridge . We have Resistance fighters on foot . Officer requests assistance . Out . Are you sure he said 1300 hours ? - Today at China Flats . - That leaves us less than two hours . Get me the coordinates for China Flats and have an assault team standing by . Yes , Commander . I want to supervise the capture of the Star-child myself . You 've done very well . I 've been looking for a bright boy ... who appreciates the possibilities of peaceful coexistence . How would you like a commission in the Young Guards ? Would I get to wear a real uniform ? Certainly . See to it right away . So you believe him ? As long as he 's on the regular dosage of procorb ... the boy 's mind is ours . And you 're certain a single assault team will be enough ? To retrieve a little girl from a handful of malcontents ? I 'm sure that one will be more than enough . Then perhaps I could dispose of Donovan permanently . Just don 't botch the job . Little girl ? She isn 't a little girl anymore . She 's ... If there 's one thing I can 't stand , it 's a two-faced woman . It 's nice to see you keep your appointments . You 're late . Yeah , we missed our bus . We 'll need two more of these . You must be Kyle . I 'm Juliet Parrish . This is Elizabeth Dunne . Yeah , we 've met . I know who you are and the chance you 're taking . I thank you . Yes , thank you . Forget it . My father and I don 't agree on much anymore . This is an interesting way to decorate your bike . Lizard repellent . Never leave home without it . What 's the quickest way to China Flats ? There 's a short cut through the glen . That is , if you can keep up . I 'll keep up . Hey , pal , is this Thursday or Friday ? - Friday , why ? - ' Cause I 'm late . - You ride a pretty mean bike . - Mean ? Tough . You know , good . I 'm sorry you 've got to go . Will I see you again ? Too many promises . Maybe someday . Someday soon . Time to go , Elizabeth . - See you around . - I hope so . Mind the store , hotshot . We 'll be right back . Ambush ! Get to the chopper ! After him ! Don 't let him escape ! I 'm afraid this flight 's been cancelled . Mr. Tyler , we meet again . The child . You were supposed to bring Elizabeth . She 's grown . You 're more beautiful than I expected . But then , your father was quite handsome before he was killed . Isn 't that right , Mr. Tyler ? I wouldn 't know . My tastes don 't run to reptiles . Save your humor for the Mothership , Mr. Tyler . A shuttle craft is on its way . And who have we here ? Staff car approaching , Diana . By the speed , it appears to be urgent . - Why isn 't he slowing down ? - He 's coming straight at us ! It 's Donovan ! Diana 's got Elizabeth . Let her go . You must be joking . Catch ! Tyler , we were beginning to worry about you . Did you get rid of that limo ? I parked it a block from the embassy with the engine running . - What ? - You gave it back to them ? Yes , with the tires slashed and enough sand in the crankcase ... to make it the biggest metal bookend in LA . All right . You know , we were really lucky today . No , I was very lucky . And I 'd like to thank you , all of you ... for trying to get me safely to New York . But I 've thought about it . I don 't want to leave you all . You 're my friends . Safety without you , it wouldn 't mean anything . Are you sure ? I 'm positive . I guess it 's settled . Except for one thing . Hey , Kyle ... like I said earlier , we could use some help . Yeah , well , I 've never been much of a joiner . But I 'll be around . All right . English

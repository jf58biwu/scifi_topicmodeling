 When one discovers love that transcends reality , is that fortunate or not ? The sky is amazing . It 's so pretty that it doesn 't seem real . One day , my prince charming will come pick me up from one of those stars . Girls ! Unrealistic romantics . Those are simply hydrogen and oxygen , plus other elements burning in the form of gas . Goro , you 're terrible . I 'm sorry . Science can be so unfeeling sometimes . Says who ? Me , Dr. Goro Horikawa . All right , we should go . If we don 't join the skiing parade in time , Mr. Fukushima and the others will nag . You 're so rational , you don 't know what girls think . Goro , you 'll never find a girlfriend . Fukamachi ? What is it ? Who 's that ? Fukamachi ? What are you doing here ? Because the stars are too beautiful . Give me a break ! Why are you all acting like this ? Come on , let 's go ! Let 's go ! It 's getting windy , come on . - Is everyone here ? - Yes . Please hurry Yes . There are extras . These belong to Yoshiyama and Horikawa . I can 't believe those two . Where are they ? Look ! Speak of the devil ! You 're late . Sorry , couldn 't keep off the beauty of the sky . And Fukamachi was there too ! Sorry . Never mind , it 's time . Be careful . Put on your skis . Teacher , Fukamachi is missing a ski . That 's strange . Is it because you were so impressed by the stars that you left them behind ? Well then . Just borrow Mr. Fukushima 's boots , he will walk down the slope . I was hoping I could show off my skiing . Stop whining . Be a man . Yes . - Let 's go ! - Bye , teacher . Careful . Unbelievable . What ? It 's winter on the mountain , but it 's spring at the bottom . Finally I understand , time is going bit by bit , like this . Yoshiyama , you 're quite a poet . She 's reached the thinking age . All she talks about is something surreal , of passing time . Where 's this flower from ? At the previous stop , I saw it in front of the station . - It 's really beautiful , so ... - Unbelievable ! Only girls pick flowers ! I need to pee . You sit . Come on . I can 't believe you , what if you miss the train ? It 's all right . What ? How 's that all right ? You come and go so suddenly . " GIRL of time " Morning . - Morning . - Morning . Morning . Come on , we 'll be late . Peach , chestnut , three years . Persimmon , eight years . Do you know what it means ? Yes . It takes three years to grow the fruit of peach and chestnut . And eight years for persimmon . The main point is coming up . Grapefruit takes nine years to fall off . Isn 't it interesting ? The word " fall off " ? And then what ? And the idiot coconut takes 18 years . Correct . You know the song well . I remembered . I used to sing that song when I was a kid . In the past , people used to sing songs that relate to ordinary life . Right . How old are you ? Sixteen . Sweet sixteen . Sixteen finally . Everyone turns sixteen this term . In that case . If you were plants , you 'd all be considered ripe ; time to turn into fruits . Take care of your health physique , and work on your mental growth as well . - Do you understand ? Answer me . - Yes . Hanano . The moon is at east , and sun in west . On both sides of a field of yellow Hanano flowers , the crimson setting sun and the moon . And the sky has a purple , blue colour . - Describe this picture ... - I 'm hungry . - In seventeen words . - Should have brought a lunchbox on Sat . - Do you understand ? - Right ? Fukamachi ? Stop chatting . And there are other ways to appreciate this . Someone once said that you can read about earth , sun and moon in this arrangement . It represents how the Japanese view the universe . Al right , the class is over . Goodbye , class . Great . Saturday is cleaning day . Finish cleaning up before you go home , understand ? Stand up . Bow . Very well . - Bye . - Bye , I 'm off . Bye . Bye , I 'm off . Bye . - Wait . - Bye . - Bye . - Bye . Oh , right . Kamiya . Yes ? Pass this key to the ones who are cleaning the classroom . We have to lock up the lab now . Someone sneaked inside during spring break , and messed with the chemicals . That 's why we must lock it . Got it . - Bye . - Bye . I 'm starving , but it 's cleanup day . We don 't have a choice , it 's our turn . Yoshiyama . The key to the lab , don 't lose it . Key ? Remember to lock it after the cleaning , and bring this back to the teachers ' office . I see . Thanks then , I 'm off . - Bye . - Bye . All right ! Let 's move it ! Come on ! I 'm starving . I 'm starving , starving ... - Starving ... - Goro , you 're a sophomore in high school , - why are you acting like a kid ? - Starving ... Starving ... is that your cleaning up song ? You act like this every time . Right , Fukamachi ? Saturdays are special ! I get hungry easily . We 're all hungry . Very well , I 'll finish up here . You two go and empty the trash . How could that be ? We 'll feel bad . I might whine , but I 'd still get the job done . It 's al right . That way we can finish sooner . We 're all hungry . Thanks then . Remember to wash your hands . The rest is easy . All right . Then please take care of the rest . Sure . Yoshiyama thinks highly of herself . How 's that ? Don 't you think so ? She bosses us around . She thinks she 's our elder sister . You think ? And she told me to wash my hands . Oh , I want to go pee . Pee . And then ... Who is it ? Goro ? Fukamachi ? Who is it ? Who is it ? Who 's there ? Who ? I know . It 's you , Fukamachi . Goro ? You can 't hide from me , come out ! I 'm going in . Fukamachi . I 've got yours and Yoshiyama 's bags . Thank you . Let 's go home ! I 'm starving . Come on . Yoshiyama . Time to walk home , I 've got your school bag . Is she still cleaning ? Where is she ? So strange . The broom is here . The door is unlocked . Yoshiyama . Yoshiyama . What happened ? Yoshiyama . What happened ? Is she dead ? Impossible . She fainted . What now ? Horikawa , could you pick her up ? Take her to the clinic , I guess she is anemic . Come on , pick her up . Why is she in this state ? I can 't . Fukamachi , you carry her . I 'll hold her legs . One , two . So heavy ! She 's fine . She fainted because she 's too hungry . You handled it well . Yes . Only three students cleaning up such a large classroom , it 's not a shock that she fainted . So ? She 's anemic . She 's too hungry . - That 's why she 's light headed . - Quiet . But . What happened to me ? You fainted in the lab , because you 're anemic . Anemic ? No ! No ? Someone was in the lab . But no one was there when we got there . The beaker fell , white smoke spread . Strange , we didn 't see a thing . You said white smoke , but your face is black . - Pass it . - Then there 's a smell . I was wondering what it was , as I approached the smoke , I fell dizzy . You really didn 't see anything ? Right ? Didn 't see anything . I heard rumours about the lab . I guess the padlock doesn 't help much . But there wasn 't anyone . Test-tube and the beaker were in the right place . How could that be ? I really ... You mentioned about some smell , but your face ... but what happened to your face ? Should we go and take a look ? Sure . I want to go too . Are you all right now ? I 'm fine , I 'd like to go too . All right . Slowly . Your jacket is over there . Okay . You sure , Yoshiyama ? I 'm fine . Hold on . Sorry . Horikawa . Oh , this handkerchief is dirty now , sorry . No problem . Thanks , Goro . I 'll wash this for you . You don 't need to . That 's strange . Everything is in order , nothing has been moved . Yoshiyama , you mentioned some smell , what kind of smell ? Kinda floral sweet ... how should I describe it ! Right ! Smelled like lavender . My mom put some lavender scent on me before . Lavender ? Any chemicals here that smell like lavender ? That ... I 'm not sure of . I heard that when people faint , they could smell camphor . Do you think that could be it ? Right , she fainted because she was starving . That must be it , right ? Are you that hungry ? Because it 's Saturday . And you only let three people to do the clean up . Got it . It 's my fault . OK , you can leave now . Horikawa , Fukamachi . Take care of Yoshiyama . Please walk her home . Sure . Bye . I 'm fine . Sorry to make you worry . Bye . Bye . Yoshiyama is having her period . She 's fine . And then . Right . Tomorrow is your birthday . Goro . Am I acting strange today ? No . I feel strange . I really saw the beaker fall on the floor . And then there 's white smoke . Where were all those ? But I was really scared . You 're so petite , I didn 't expect you to be so heavy . Right , Fukamachi ? Goro , you 're so mean . That was scary . Yoshiyama , you 're having a bad day . Anyway , it 's all right . Hereafter you 're only gonna have good luck Right . Keep going . Bye . Thank you very much . Kazuko . Hello , Mrs. Horikawa . You 're here . Fukamachi , you 're back too . I 'm back . See you on Monday . Bye . Bye , Mrs. Horikawa . - Bye . - Bye . - Bye . - It 's all right , you needn 't walk me home . That 's fine , I insist . I 'm fine now . Don 't say that , it 's my responsibility to take care of you . What ? The teacher just told you to walk me home . But ... It 's Kazuko Miss Kazuko , come on in . Hello . Go in . Come on in , I 'll make some tea . Come on in . Let 's go . This way . What is it ? That 's the smell . The smell ? There are flowers in the greenhouse . It 's lavender . Sorry ? The smell is similar to that in the lab . I think my grandpa grows some in the greenhouse . I 'd like to take a look . Please , let me take a look at the lavender . This way . Here . This is lavender . On the hillside in Southern France , lavender blooms all over summer . Valley after valley will turn purple . Lavender is used to make perfume and scent . It 's one of the main scent in cologne . It 's cute . It 's my first time to see lavender . Are you all right , Yoshiyama ? That 's the smell , I 'm sure . Let 's go . I think tea is ready . Sorry , I have to go now . I 'll walk with you . Don 't worry , I 'd like to be alone . Are you sure you 'll be all right ? I 'm sorry to have worried you . Please apologize to your grand parents about the tea . Tomorrow is Sunday , take a good rest . I will , bye . Wait . - Wait . - Wait . - Wait . - Wait . Morning . Kazuko . Agreed it 's Sunday but even then you get up too late ! They 've all gone out . You want some tea ? Your dad 's gone for a golf competition . He said he 'd like to win a stereo for you . But I guess he 's more likely to get a melon , the consolation prize . He isn 't exactly the sporty type . You 're more like me , thank goodness . And Yoshiko is more like him . Mom . The tea is getting cold . I made it especially for you . What 's wrong ? You look pale . Are you unwell ? I feel a bit strange . Are you all right ? I 'm going out . Wait . You better lay down . No , I 'm fine . Hello . Hi , the young master is inside . Sorry to disturb . Hello . It 's warm . A bit hot . How could that be ? I like this smell . Smell of soy sauce , it feels gentle . Easy for you to say , I 'm the son of a soy sauce shop fella . This is where I 'm at everyday . Careful , come . Sorry . Are you feeling better ? Goro , I ... Sorry , could you be quiet for a minute ? I don 't want this to leak . Sorry . Welcome , Kazuko . Goro , take a break , Kazuko is here . No , it 's al right . I 'm here to return this . Thanks , Goro . I 've washed it . Thanks very much . The handkerchief smells of soy sauce . - I 'm off . - Sorry to disturb you . Bye , Mrs. Horikawa . Bye . Goro , about what we discussed last night , I think it 's better for you to go to college . No , that 's all right . I prefer staying here . Ever since when dad 's here , I grew up amidst this soy sauce smell Morning . Morning . I heard you waited the other day . I was a bit unwell . Then you should rest during P.E. I 'm fine , I 'd like to sweat it out . Are you sure ? Yes . Yoshiyama . Actually I saw you yesterday . In front of Horikawa 's house . You were really out of spirit then . Are you sure you 're all right ? Morning ... Morning . Great , next one . Come on . Good . Are you all right ? I 'm fine . Don 't push it . I won 't . I 'm fine . What are you doing , Fukamachi ? Come back . Coming . Yoshiyama , what 's wrong ? - Coming . - Next . It takes a while to learn well . Don 't idle your youth away . - Goro , wake up ... - Haven 't noticed the grass by the pond ... - Goro , wake up ... now . - The autumn leaves ... Who 's talking ? Yoshiyama , come out Find the flashbacks . Yes , sir . Not even close . I 'll let you off this time , but you must review . Yes , sir . - Kamiya . - Yes . - Your turn . - Yes . Go ! Pass it . Go ! What 's wrong , Yoshiyama ? Yoshiyama . Earthquake . Kazuko , come on . Calm down , to the courtyard . OK . - Have you turned off the stoves ? - Yes . - Dad , your cigarette . - Come on , dad . Come on , dear . - Hurry up , dear . - Hurry . It stopped . That was quite strong . Relax , 1st round is always most perilous , there might be aftershocks . I think we better stay out here . The aftershocks won 't be too bad , go back to the house . - Better not catch a cold . - Let 's go . Come on . The rain has stopped . Let 's go . Fire ! Right , where 's that ? I 'm heading out . Where to ? - I want to go too . - No ! It 's Goro 's house . I 'll go check it out . - It 's dangerous ! - So mean ! Can 't believe her ! It 's dangerous , don 't go . Al right , back off . There 's nothing to see here . Leave . Not sure . Suddenly I heard a bang . It 's from inside , sounds like an explosion . Yes . That 's how the fire started . Scary . - Lucky it isn 't the soy sauce shop . - That 's true . - Smells burnt . - Yes . Fukamachi . You 're here too ? - I could see it 's Goro 's house from home . - The fire is out . Team one dismiss ! - Come on , let 's go . - That 's Goro . Goro . Yoshiyama , Fukamachi . You two are here too . Terrible . I need to pick up the mess after the quake . So tired ! You need any help ? No , thanks . Hey , you . They 're worried , that 's why they are here . Is that so ? Thanks . Is there anything we could do ? No , thanks . We can manage . Thanks . In that case , we 're off . Thanks . Good night . Good night . Thanks . Good night . See you at school tomorrow . I 'm taking a day off tomorrow , because ... Of what ? I 'm going to collect some plants . Fukamachi . You love flowers more than girls do . There 's one plant I really want this time . Is that so ? Fukamachi , I ... Yes ? Nothing . Just tell me . Don 't worry , it 's nothing . Keep your spirits up , or I 'll be worried . Thanks , I will . Deal ? Yes . Pinky swear . Why are you wearing your pajamas ? You 'll catch a cold . Good night . Who is it ? Fukamachi ? I was dreaming . Oh no ! I 'm going to be late . That 's mine . Look ! The melon is ripe ! - No , I 'm gonna be late . - Just eat a little . You 've forgotten again . - Let me do it . - Bye . The Botany professor has gone out already ? Morning . Morning , Yoshiyama . You look well today . Thanks about last night . Good thing it wasn 't too bad . But I couldn 't sleep all night . I fell asleep at dawn . Run ! It 's dangerous . Dreaming again ! What 's going on ? Come . Morning . You are up early today . Is that so ? I 'll make you some miso soup . I want melon . Tomorrow . It 's not ripe enough yet . That 's what you said yesterday . What are you talking about ? - Mine ... - Miser . You must eat something , it 's bad for your health . I don 't want to eat . What 's the matter ? You forgot the calendar again ? I 'm off . Kazuko . I did it already . Right . Careful . I ripped it already . Morning , Botany professor . How are you ? - Morning . - Morning . Morning . - Morning . - Morning . You look well . Yes . Mr. Fukushima , your tie . What 's wrong ? Nothing . I wanted to tell you it looks very nice yesterday . Yesterday ? What ? I 'm off . She said yesterday . But you gave this to me just last night , and it 's the first time I 'm wearing it . Mr. Fukushima , do you have a tie like that ? No . If you do , why didn 't you tell me ? Honestly I don 't . Morning . Isn 't it the 19th ? Sorry ? Today 's date . What are you talking about ? It 's the 18th . Pull yourself together . Right , I heard that you fainted the other day . Are you all right ? Morning . - Morning ... - Morning . - Morning ... - Morning . Morning . You 're here . What 's wrong ? Nothing . Are you feeling unwell ? A little , I didn 't sleep well . Didn 't sleep well ? I guess it 's because of the earthquake and fire last night . I was a bit shocked . What earthquake and fire ? Goro , you . After the earthquake last night , the house behind yours was on fire . Yoshiyama , what 's the matter with you ? Morning . Fukamachi , today you ... Stand up . Bow . Morning , sir . Sit down . So how 's everyone today ? Our target today is to be self-responsible , self-aware . Use a new approach to view yourselves . Good , next one . Come . Yoshiyama , are you all right ? Not really . What 's bothering you ? Tell me . Fukamachi , why aren 't you collecting plants today ? What are you doing , Fukamachi ? Come back . Coming . - It takes a while to learn well . - Yesterday 's question . - Don 't idle your youth away . - You knew the teacher Haven 't noticed the grass by the pond ... - is going to ask this ? - Before the dreams ... - I reviewed this last night . - It 's the first time I heard this . - This sentence means ... No , it 's gone . Who 's talking ? Yoshiyama , come out and find the flashbacks . Great . Impressive . Well done . Thanks . It 's about learning and time . Like Horikawa if you sleep in the class you 'll never learn a thing . What 's wrong , Yoshiyama ? Yoshiyama . Yoshiyama . - What 's going on ? - I 'm off . Yoshiyama . Yoshiyama . Yoshiyama , over here . Up here . You 're soaked , come in for a second . I 'm home alone and bored . I 'll be right over . Climb up the stairs next to the entrance . Hi . You were in extra-curricular activity club ? I didn 't finish it . It feels great in here . Yes , it 's because of my grandparents . Come in . Sorry to disturb . This is my first visit here . That 's strange , we 've known each other since we were kids . Right . I guess it 's because I go to your house often . That I remember well . At that time . - Peach , chestnut , three years . - Persimmon , eight years . Grapefruit takes nine years to fall off . And the idiot coconut takes 18 years . I 'll eat this . Am I pretty ? Kazuko . Fukamachi , you 've always been very considerate . Dried flowers . We have plenty here . But I 've just started to dry them , so only these . Very pretty , they suit you . I beg you , Fukamachi . Why did you say that , all of a sudden ? Don 't think that I 'm a strange girl . I don 't think that . Could I take a look at your pajamas ? Pajamas ? Please . I 'd like to confirm something . Sure . Look . I always wear this one . Only this one ? There 're only old people in my family , we don 't buy pajamas . Really ? Thanks . What was that for ? I know I 've been weird . What do you mean ? Don 't laugh . I feel like my time has gone back one day . What 's happening today has happened yesterday . What happened in school , and everything else . There will be an earthquake tonight . And a fire at Goro 's neighbour . Isn 't that ' deja vu ' ? It happens . Deja vu ? What does that mean ? Ability to foresee the future . Ability to foresee the future ? Doesn 't that happen often ? Seems like something you 've experienced before though it 's your first time . Somewhere you 've visited for the first time but it looked familiar , as if you 've been there before . Haven 't you had this experience before ? Yes , but not throughout a day . Even if it 's a dream , it can 't be that long . What is it ? Time to water the plants in the greenhouse , I almost forgot . Wait . I want to help . In that case . - Peach , chestnut , three years . - Persimmon , eight years . It 's that song . - Grapefruit takes nine years to fall off . - The idiot coconut takes 18 years . The fruit of love is at the bottom of the sea . The sky 's sigh has turned into stars . It takes millions of years for people to meet . Millions of years ... for people to meet . So romantic . I had no idea about these lyrics . You better stay away from that side . Lavender . I don 't want you to get sick . I 'm scared . Strange . Why am I becoming like this ? I guess you just feel a bit uneasy . This happens a lot when one grows up . Really ? Yes , don 't worry . Fukamachi , I beg you . Please save me . Sure . Sorry , I 've been acting very strange . So I 'm right . It 's shaking ! - Into the courtyard . - Hurry , dad . - Hurry , Kazuko . - Don 't worry . It 's fine . - Calm down , it will get worse . - Our house will be fine . Don 't panic , Kazuko . Where are you going ? I 'll be back soon . I 'm checking on the fire . It 's dangerous , don 't go . What fire ? Mean ! There 's a fire ! Oh no ! Fire ! Fire ! Fire ! Fukamachi . I took you seriously , that 's why I 'm here . Just like you said . I just want to know if there 's anything I can help . It 's more dangerous to stay here . As you predicted , the fire should be put out soon . Not my prediction . - Fire ! Put out the fire ! - Fukamachi , your pajamas . Granny told me to buy this when I ran errands this afternoon . - This was the one I saw . - Put out the fire . Come on ! Hurry ! Goro . Should we tell Goro not to worry ? You better don 't move anything . - What are you going to tell him ? - Hurry ! - Let 's go back ! - Fire ! - What happened ? - There 's a fire . Hurry and help . Where 's the fire engine ? Hurry . What happened ? So scary ! Put out the fire ! Is the fire engine here ? It 's spreading . Come help . Teleportation ? A type of supernatural power , can shift to another time and place . But my time is backwards . How do you explain that ? The ability to shift between time . In other words , you can use your mind to shift between time . That 's the explanation . You 're lying . This can 't be real . It 's unreal . How come ? What happened to yesterday ? And ... where am I if I 'm supposed to live in tomorrow ? - Not existing . - That 's not it . The same person can 't exist in two times and places . I 'm getting really confused now . Hold me tight , Fukamachi . I feel very safe with you . The fruit of love is at the bottom of the sea . The sky 's sigh has turned into stars . It takes millions of years for people to meet . No ... I don 't want to . Why can 't I just be normal ? I want to be an ordinary girl , I just want to be with you like this . I think you 're just too nervous , that 's why you 're like this . Relax . And you should be fine . Really ? Is that what you think ? Right . So much has happened tonight . You better rest . Thanks , I will . Don 't tire yourself tomorrow . Tomorrow ? Yes , I remember you 'll go collecting plants . How did you know ? Because , to me today has happened for a second time . Right . Sorry . As long as someone understands . Don 't worry . Is that so ? Then , good night . Good night . How come the cut on your hand is gone ? What cut ? When we both were injured . It wasn 't a deep cut , I healed quickly , and the scar isn 't obvious . Really ? To me , that cut means a lot . Good night , Fukamachi . Good night . Oh no ! I 'm gonna be late . Are you all right ? Come , eat some melon first . It 's ripe enough . Oh no ! I 'll do it . I 'm off . Wait , Kazuko . Goro . Goro ! It 's dangerous . Yoshiyama . Fukamachi . Fukamachi . Yoshiyama . Anyone home ? Fukamachi . Fukamachi . Fukamachi . Fukamachi . Fukamachi . It 's all because of this smell . At the time . Fukamachi . Fukamachi . Fukamachi . Fukamachi . Fukamachi . What 's going on , Yoshiyama ? Why are you here ? I want to see you , I really miss you . Fukamachi . Careful . Hold on tight . So that was real . What I saw , the white smoke that smells like lavender . There must be a secret behind the lavender . Fukamachi , I must find out the truth . Please tell me . You can 't go back to the origin if you keep jumping like this . You 'll only end up as a departed spirit of the time . I can return to that time . Sorry ? That time , the lab on Saturday . Why ? What for ? I 've turned really strange after that . Have you forgotten ? That was just a small accident , you better forget it . I want to find out the truth . If you insist , then we might never see each other again . No ! I want to know the truth . Maybe it 's better if you don 't know the truth . Don 't do it . With such a strange power , I 'd rather be with you , Fukamachi . No , I just want to turn back into a normal girl . And ... Are you absolutely certain ? Yes . I get it . Since you say so . But listen , don 't be a vagabond of time . Or a departed spirit of time . You must have faith . Go back to that day in the lab . Close your eyes . Focus . The lab , Saturday . The lab , Saturday . The lab . Fukamachi . The lab , Saturday . Dad , mom . Kazuko . Kazuko . Right . I can 't exist in both times . - I must go back . - Kazuko . Dad , mom . - Peach , chestnut , three years . - Persimmon , eight years . Grapefruit takes nine years to fall off . - And the idiot coconut ... - Goro . Takes 18 years . Fukamachi , where are you ? Fukamachi . - Fukamachi . - You ... My condolences . So sad . The son , daughter-in-law and grandson died together . - Not even the grandson lives . - Must be terrible . Dear , Kazuko ... Mom . Kazuko , where are you ? Please , dear . Don 't run around . It takes a while to learn well . Don 't idle your youth away . Haven 't noticed the spring grass by the pond ... the autumn leaves . The fruit of love is at the bottom of the sea . Fukamachi , where are you ? The lab , Saturday . The lab . The lab , Saturday . Come on , let 's go . Sure . Here you are , the key to the lab . You must lock it from today on . Don 't lose it . Today is Saturday ? Of course , why are you acting so strange ? Right , where were you ? Here you are . It 's all right , she hasn 't been lazy . Sorry . - Bye , see you on Monday . - Bye . Al right ! Let 's go ! Right , Goro . Please help me bring my school bag . Then we can leave right afterwards . I 'll go there first . Got it . Bye . Bye , see you on Monday . And I 'll go pee . Wait , Goro . Let me see your right hand . Thanks . You 're welcome . Sorry . What 's wrong ? See you later . See you . Fukamachi . I knew it 's you . I don 't want to worry you . Tell me who you are , the truth . I 'm from the future . How 's that possible ? I 'm from the year 2660 , I 've a Ph.D. In Pharmacy . But you 're just a teenager . This is the result of an advanced education system . I don 't get it , but why ? Plants are hard to find . Owing to the advancement of Science , and over-explosion in population Green plants have almost become extinct . But we need plants in pharmacy . Especially lavender . And then ? Right , that 's why I 'm here . Fortunately , Fukamachi 's home has plenty of lavender . They lost their son , daughter-in-law grandson in a traffic accident . And lead a lonely life . To me , it 's ideal . Because they 're an old couple who grow all kinds of plants in the greenhouse . But how did you get here ? You 've done the same , teleportation , shifting between time . In the future , supernatural powers are common . How long can you stay here ? Today , right . Only a very short time . A very short time ? I thought we knew each other since we were kids . No , just one month . Liar . It was a long time ago . No . We met that night during ski trip . Those stars . They were amazing . I 'm sorry , I use mind control . By sending brain waves to the others . So that they 'll have favourable memories of me . So my childhood memories , happy memories with you . They were lies . Even the cut . Sorry , but that 's the case . That 's between you and Horikawa . I borrowed your memories . But I was sincere to you . That 's how I felt about you . Yes ... and that song . That song ... the lyrics in the back , that can 't be a lie . Because you taught me that , Fukamachi . I did that myself . I remember you taught me . Bye . No ! No ! Sorry , I 've already broken the rules . I 've told you everything . Don 't go . I must go back . I want to go with you . No , you belong here , now . You must stay here . You can 't meddle with history . Not only this , I must erase your memory . Please , I won 't tell anyone . I 'll keep all these in my heart . So ... No , not just yours . Everyone else 's . All those I 've brain washed . I need to erase everyone 's memories . And finally my own ... No . This can 't be an exception . Please . At least let me keep my memory of you . I 'll cherish it and live well . No ! Absolutely not ! You better forget me . No ! I don 't want that ! In this time , you could live happily . You and Horikawa . No ! Stop saying that . I 've made up my mind , I 'll follow you . I like your world too , better than where I 'm from . Everyone 's easy going , filled with kind and considerate people . But I 've my responsibility for my time . People are waiting for my return , get it ? Now it 's time for us to part . Are you off ? No ! No ! I don 't understand this . My heart aches , why 's that ? Is this love ? Do I love someone ? Is this love ? You 'll understand some day . But I 'm running out of time . Why does time pass by ? Time isn 't the past , it 's the future . Will you come back ? Maybe one day . Then answer me , will we see each other again ? Yes , but you won 't recognize me . You 'd only see me as a stranger . And there 's no way for me to look you up . I know . Bye . Bye , I 'll never forget you . Bye . Yoshiyama , where are you ? Yoshiyama . Where are you ? Yoshiyama . Kazuko , where are you ? Mom , you should 've bought a new mirror .

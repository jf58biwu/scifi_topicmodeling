 We suffered losses . You don 't fight a force like theirs without losses . - How many losses ? - Seven men and women killed . A dozen wounded . You 're wounded too . These wounds are nothing ... But we 're gonna fight them till we win . We 're gonna fight till El Salvador is free ! Ain 't nothing gonna stop us ! - You got that ? - Yeah , I got it . - This don 't look so good . - You kidding ? This is great ! Come on . You 'll get me killed ! - You 'll get another Emmy . - I 'll get a bullet ! Look ! Look at him ! Unbelievable ! What 's unbelievable is , we 're still here ! Now , come on , man ! Get in already . Hurry up ! - I wish we had a Tyler mount . - I wish we had a tank . Hang in there , Tony . It 's no worse than Cambodia ! I could have passed for one of them there ! Where did he go ? - Tony , you okay ? - Loving every minute of it . I knew I should have gone to law school . - Can you run ? - Do I have a choice ? - Not really . - Let 's go . I 'm gonna draw their fire . You go to those trees . Mike , you 're crazy . We 're going out together . - No ! - Get your can in gear . Go ! Mike ! Come on , Algernon , show Dr. Metz your tummy . It 's remarkable ! - The lesion 's nearly healed . - Yes . You know how long my staff has been searching for that formula ? No , Ruth helped a lot . Not so . She did it all herself . Well , I was very lucky . The truth is , Juliet , that you are very , very gifted . I warn you , Ruth and I will try to steal you from the med school . Get you into biochemistry full-time . Have you heard ? They 're everywhere . They 're all around the world . Wherever the reports have come from Paris , Rome , Geneva , Buenos Aires , Tokyo descriptions of the craft are all identical . And now I 'm told that our affiliate station KXT in San Francisco has a picture . There it is . Good Lord ! It 's coming in across the Golden Gate . This is a live picture from San Francisco . Gently , Robert . She 's a very special lady . Upper Pleistocene . Much older than we found before , Quinton . That she is , lad . Notice the contour of her forehead . See how it ... Richard , what is that ? It 's huge . What the devil ! It must be three miles across . This is the scene at the Champs Elys√öes . This picture is live from Paris where another giant UFO is moving overhead . The Pentagon reports that fighters from air bases around the nation have approached the UFOs , but the jets reported interference with their onboard guidance and electrical equipment making it impossible to get within a mile . Missiles fired simply go astray and detonate well out of range . Here you see one of the craft approaching Washington D. C. Police and troops are trying to maintain orderly evacuation here and all the other cities threatened by this unknown menace . Roads and highways are jammed with traffic . Other craft are approaching at least six other major cities . San Francisco , Houston , New York and New Orleans the Chicago area and Los Angeles . Get the car started . - Come on , Mom . - Come on , let 's go , let 's go ! Polly ! - Are you hurt ? - I didn 't hit her . She came right at me . I didn 't hit her . - Get out of here . - He 's still at school . There it is ! Everything 's gonna be all right , but we gotta move ! - Mom ? - I ran out of my house . I thought it was an earthquake . It is not an earthquake , Ruby . Dear God , what is it ? It 's fantastic . TASS confirms reports that similar crafts are now approaching Moscow Leningrad and Vladivostok . This would bring the unofficial count to 31 . How can it just hang there ? Cairo is reporting that its UFO is stationary now like all the others . I still think we should leave the city . No , the roads are jammed . - Oh , Stanley . - You heard the president . So far , they 're not hostile . But if they are ... ? If they are , Lynn I 'm not sure where we would find a hiding place . ... out of fear or hope of what this event will mean to all of us . - Look , it 's London ! - Parliament is waiting like the rest of us , for some first sign of contact . The Soviet Union is broadcasting throughout Russia ... - Daddy ! - Mom , Dad 's home . Are you all right ? Everybody okay ? - It 's so neat . - Come on , Polly . - It 's scary too . - Robert ... ! I know , I know . Me too . At least we 're together . And coming up on 16 hours now since first reports started yesterday . It 's 8 : 00 here in New York ... It 's 5 : 00 here . Why did you let me sleep ? Don 't worry , Denny . They said Wall Street isn 't going to open . I 'd hate to think what would happen to the market if it did . - Where 's Dan Rather ? - He finally lost his voice . They 're just doing recaps mostly . Nothing 's changed ? No contact ? No . Ray Bradbury was just on with Arthur Clarke . Nothing solid , more speculations . Nobody knows what to think . - Going to the hospital ? - Yeah . The ER 's jumping . Lots of heart attack victims and suicide attempts . They 're gonna need all the med students . And how about stockbrokers ? You 'd come and help ? Sure . I 'd like to be with you , in case . Here 's the scene in Athens , Greece , the cradle of Western civilization which is insignificant compared to that ship hovering over the city . This is only one of 50 identical spacecraft over 50 cities around the world . Do you realize that this is a whole new beginning for all of us ? - I wonder what they 'll do ... - Danny this could be the last day we ever see . Well ... I don 't want to die till I 've made love . Robin ! Daniel ! Something 's happening . The same occurrence now in Jerusalem . The pulsing signal has also begun . There you see it . And you hear the pulsing tone . Listen ... outside . Now the UFO over Los Angeles has joined this strange , unearthly choir . Wait . I 'm told that ... What ? There 's a vocal signal coming through ! This may be the contact we 've been waiting for . It 's being picked up on the international emergency frequency . We 're monitoring and ... Twenty-one . Twenty . - Nineteen . - There . You hear it . It 's in English ! No , I 'm told that it 's in different languages around the world . Five . Four . One . Citizens of Earth , we bring you greetings and we come in peace . May we request the secretary general of your United Nations : Please come to the top of the U.N. building in New York , at 0100 Greenwich mean time . That 's 8 : 00 New York time . This evening . Thank you . - Can you make it ? - I 'm not missing this . Mike ? - I heard you drew the TV pool . - Yeah . Me too . Thought I recognized your deck of cards . Hi , Kristine . Hi , Tony . So where do we set up ? You could have said goodbye when you left me . Hey , I did . You were too busy hustling another assignment . Sorry . So was I. Thirty seconds now until 8 : 00 . The secretary general is coming out . He 's indicating to the troops to lower their weapons and they 're doing so . Just 15 seconds now . He 's looking upward as we all are . A hush has fallen not just here , but all around the world as 8 : 00 strikes , 0100 Greenwich mean time ... Now . It 's opening ! Something is coming out . A smaller craft , moving down from the mothership ... It 's all right . They said they came in peace . What is it , Daddy ? I don 't know . Some kind of landing craft ? ... across 3rd Avenue and 39th directly towards the U.N. building . Wow ! It 's neat , Mom , huh ? It 's completing its turn now . Now the craft is coming closer slowly drifting downward . - Mommy , can I have a soda ? - In a second , honey . - The air itself feels strange . Vibrating . What was that ? I couldn 't understand . I think the voice spoke Swedish . That 's the native language of the secretary general . I 'm getting the translation now . It seems to be : " Do not be afraid . Please come up the ramp . " That 's one brave man , I can tell you . ... now is disappearing through the opening . - Take it easy . - There is some activity but it 's too dark up inside ... There he is ! - The secretary general is appearing ... - Oh , thank God ! ... apparently unharmed . - My fellow citizens of Earth . - Now the bad news . These Visitors assure me they have come in peace and that they wish to honor all the covenants of our United Nations Charter . As you 'll see they 're much like us although their voices are unusual . They asked for me to speak on their behalf but I felt that everyone would be more comfortable if their supreme commander who is aboard this vessel spoke directly to all of you . His voice will be heard around the world in every language necessary . We can hear footsteps now ... He looks like one of us . A middle-aged man roughly six feet . He looks like one of us , Ben . Outwardly . But that was no Nash Rambler he drove up in . Aw , Mom , he 's no E.T. He doesn 't even look like Mr. Spock . The boots appear to be like kid . The garment looks like polished cotton . Their evolutionary pattern was identical to ours . - Has he got four fingers and a thumb ? - It looks like . Incredible ! I think that he 's about to speak . I trust that you will forgive me , but our eyes are unaccustomed to this sort of brightness . His voice is strange . He clearly isn 't one of us . It 's fascinating , though . We have come in peace . You see ? In peace . Our planet is the fourth in distance from the star you call Sirius some 8 . 7 light-years from Earth . - Fantastic ! This is the first time we have left our system . And you the first intelligent life we 've encountered . We 're pleased to meet you . Our names would sound peculiar so my fellow Visitors and I have chosen simple names from Earth . My name is John . The secretary general has referred to me as the supreme commander . Actually I 'm just sort of an admiral responsible for this small fleet around your planet . " This small fleet " ? Right . We have monitored Earth for quite a while to learn your languages . But some of us are not as skilled as others , and I hope you 'll be patient with us . We have come on behalf of our Great Leader . Him who governs our united planet with benevolence and wisdom . We have come because we need your help . Our planet is in serious environmental difficulty . Far worse than yours . We will be unable to survive without immediate assistance . There are certain chemicals and compounds which we must manufacture which alone can save our struggling civilization . And you can help us to manufacture these . In return , we will share with you all the fruits of our knowledge . Unbelievable . Yeah . Now that we have established contact we 'd like to meet with governments to request certain operating plants be retooled for the manufacture of the compound we need . I hope they pick your plant . And we 'll reward your generosity , as I have said by educating your industrial and scientific complex as much as we can . Helping to solve your own environmental agricultural and health dilemmas . We 'll leave you as we came in peace . Talk about an offer we can 't refuse . What would happen if we did ? Now , if our circumstances were reversed and you had come to visit us , I 'd feel a burning curiosity to see the inside of your spacecraft . An understatement . We request the secretary general and a few journalists to accompany us aboard our ship . ... for the first of many opportunities to know us better . - Hot damn , here we go . - I was afraid of this . The team , selected earlier by lots , will provide full coverage ... Wow , Mom , it 's Dad ! He 's going up . Did you hear ? They said Mike Don ... Look , there he is ! I can 't believe it ! I wonder if this means I 'll get more alimony . You see them preparing for this most remarkable ... You worried for him ? Since the morning I gave birth to him . The team now moving out of the press area . Would I like to get into his ship ! I 'd like to get into his DNA . - I wonder if there 's any kids . - Don 't be stupid ! I wish they 'd send a scientist . You 'd be first in line . Mommy , can I have a soda , please ? ... the supreme commander or John , as we 'll call him . John is shaking hands with all the journalists . You see , Lynn , they 're shaking hands . It 's great . Huh , Father ? They 're going into the shuttle . The secretary general is going inside the craft with Geri Taylor and Sam Egan . Kristine Walsh is smiling ... Arthur , if they need refineries you ought to talk to Richland and put a bid in . - I guess it could be quite ... - Prestigious . Mike Donovan is about to follow the others and move inside . They 're shooting videotape we 'll all want to see when they return . Good luck , y 'all . Good luck . Good luck . Good luck . And now the shuttlecraft is lifting off from the U.N. building . Good luck . I love you , Dad . Another bottle ? Sure . How often do we celebrate our coverage of the story of the century ? - Keep in mind we lucked into it . - It wasn 't luck . I stacked the deck we drew from to get the pool . Oh , come on ! I really did . Did you put the tape in ? You saw it when it aired . Yeah . Wasn 't it terrific ? Everyone 's reactions . Play it again , Sam . One more time . For those of us accustomed to the likes of Close Encounters or the futuristic Star Destroyer , our first glimpses inside the spacecraft of the Visitors were somewhat unexpected or disappointing . Pour it in the glass ! No great walls of lights , or other things science-fiction buffs would take in stride . The docking bay looked like the hangar deck of one of our big aircraft carriers . John tells us this landing bay can handle three dozen shuttlecraft and that there are 200 other landing bays like this one throughout each of the 50 gigantic motherships . Just your average interstellar Welcome Wagon . It all seems a little easy . Fast-forward , Mike . Your life is on fast-forward . - You have male and female in your crew ? - Of course . This is Diana , our second-in-command . Your girlfriend . You gave her more closeups than me . - Hello . - Hello . Diana ' s in charge of all the scientific aspects of our mission . Shall we go forward to the engine room ? This is what you would call our engine room . And the yellow doors ? Restricted areas , a lot of radioactivity . Our gravity drive is quite effective but takes up nearly half the ship . It enables us to travel at a velocity near the speed of light . - How long have you had this technology ? - About 100 years . You see ? Another closeup . Why didn 't it work for us before ? I 'd like to try again . Cryogenic ? Maximum efficiency in storage . You also mentioned living quarters for the crew . How many are there on each ship ? It varies . Several thousand . Can we talk to some of them ? Of course , Kristine . You 'll have plenty of opportunity for that . Aren 't you glad I made you call up Richland ? If we play our cards right , you could be a senior VP soon . It 's been three weeks since our first contact with the Visitors . Did you see Mike ? Yes . He said hello but was very busy . I 'm sure he is . This is a big event to cover . This refinery in Los Angeles will be the first plant to work with the Visitors . It will manufacture their chemical for transport back to Sirius . The raw materials will be the refuse of our cities . And now the Visitor technicians are emerging . A scene to be repeated hundreds of times in cities all around the world . And there 's Diana . I didn 't think they 'd send so many . I think they look real snappy in those uniforms . - Shoot ! - What 's the matter , Caleb ? What 's the matter ? Man , look at all those guys . First we fight you honkies for a job , then the Mexicans now these creeps . And they ain 't even from this planet ! Gee , how many of them are there ? And now a second shuttlecraft is approaching . Mike , how many of them are there ? Then the Visitor technicians moved inside a huge refinery beginning to familiarize ... - I thought you had to work . - I quit . How come ? Their register was short . They blamed me . - You can 't keep quitting your jobs . - Dad , would you just get off my case ? ... who are curious about him and his fellow Visitors . Steven , who is a very personable and ... That 's good . Well , after five years of anatomy it better be . I meant the market . It 's really surging up . We 've got good times ahead . Yes , Kristine , most all the plants we 've chosen are on the coastlines to make convenient and economic use of sea water . It was a fascinating party . It was our first close encounter with the neighborhood E.T.s. Eleanor was in her glory . Wallowing , I 'd say . I am pleased she granted us the audience . I felt a little nervous when I met him . Did you notice that his hand was very cool ? I tried to notice everything I could . Like what ? He totally avoids cooked foods . Only ate a few of the raw vegetables . Outside we were being eaten by mosquitoes . He was not . I saw you trying to talk to him . Sure , I learned a little . They 're monogamous . The female with him , Barbara , said that she isn 't his wife . She didn ' t talk much , seemed real shy . He told me that their planet 's much like Earth . He said he 's no anthropologist but he thought that their evolution was quite similar to ours . It was hard to talk with Arthur stroking him all the time . Arthur couldn ' t hold a candle to his good old wife . There 's something else I noticed that was real curious . Whenever he walked past the birdcage they went crazy . They fluttered like mad like panic . Well , anyway I thought Steven was really quite charming . Oh , really ? You 're gonna run off to Sirius ? Get serious . Hey ! Watch out where the hell you 're going . Oh , excuse . - Help , please . - Help what ? I am just . - Just what ? - Yes . Get out the way , damn stupid alien . In response to overwhelming questions and requests by young adults worldwide the Visitors ' supreme commander , John , has formed the Visitors ' Friends . This organization is open to all young adults , ages 12 to 20 who are anxious to gain first-hand knowledge of the Visitors to ride in squad vehicles and have special tours of the motherships . Visitor youth leaders will soon be coming to your neighborhoods . Oh , my gosh ! There he is . He 's the one from the plant . - He 's such a fox ! - Looks like a boy to me . Oh , my gosh . He 's looking over here . He is really something special . Just think of where he came from ! Think of it . Hi there . Are you okay ? I am just . Yeah ? What ? Just . Just , just . - Yes . Just . - Just what ? Don 't let it get you spazzed . I 'll help you out . Yes , help . Help to go . To this place . I 'm just . - You don 't know where to go . - I 'm just . You 're " lost . " Lost ! Yes , lost . English not well to me . Learned Arabic for going there . They screwed up and sent you to L.A. ? Yes , screwed . Well , L.A. ' s not so bad . Beats Fresno , let me tell you . What 's your name ? - William . - Hi , I 'm Harmy . That 's short for Harmony . Can you believe it ? " Cryo ... Cryogenic Transfer Unit . " Well , come on , Willy . We 'll go find it . The pressure 's still not balanced . It must be a bad inner seal . Someone will have to go inside . Excuse me . Is this the Cryogenic Transfer Section ? Yes . William , where were you ? - I was lost . - See you later . Get up there . You 'll be working with that man . You 're pleased with the progress here , then ? Yes . It 's representative of the other plants around the world . Shortly we 'll begin our seminars for your scientists . There 's something else I 'm pleased with too , Kristine . It 's you . Of all the journalists we 've met , my people feel most comfortable with you . And so do I. Well , thank you , Diana . We 've done research that shows your people have much confidence in you . You have ? You 're trusted , respected and attractive . Qualities which are essential in our new official spokeswoman . No , Quinton isn 't here . There 's nothing in his current box . I 'm not sure what he was working on . He hasn 't been here all day . Not at all . Yes , I tried at home . There 's no answer . What ? It is ? You 're sure it 's his car ? Press secretary ? They said I could call it what I wanted . - You like " spokeswoman " better ? - I don 't like the sound of either one . You 're jealous . You know I 'm not . I just don 't understand why you 'd want to do it . They want someone the public trusts and I think it 's an excellent career move . - What about your objectivity ? - What ? Aren 't you compromising by sucking up to them ? I 'm not sucking up to anybody ! Don 't you see ? It 's the perfect opportunity to get the inside stuff . Exclusive material that no one else has access to . I 'm sure to get a book out of it at the very least . I 'm going to stay objective . After all , I 'm one of us , not them . Come on , any good reporter would be crazy not to jump at this . I 'd like to think I had your backing on this , Mike . You know how much I respect you . More than that . You better put the steaks back in the freezer . What ? Oh , yeah . Tonight 's a problem because Diana wants to meet ... How did you know ? - Caleb ! - Still down in there ! The liquid nitrogen blew through the inner seal . There 's no way to get down there to him ! William , stop ! For God 's sake ! - William went in there after Caleb . - What ? It 's minus 300 degrees down there . There 's no way a human being could ... - Where are the cultures ? - They 're not back from pathology . They 're running way behind , Dr. Metz . I heard two key people didn 't show up today , didn 't even call . That 's odd . Dr. Taylor . Ben , It 's Julie . Get down to the ER , stat . They just brought in your father . Daniel is not taking care of anything ... Abraham , he 's only 17 . Don 't be so hard on him . But Daniel has been this way for years . He 's no good in school . He has hardly any friends . Well , maybe this Visitor Friends group will be just the thing he needs . He just hasn 't found his niche yet , that 's all . Unlike others we could mention . - Sorry I 'm late . - I was waiting , naughty boy . A little problem at the plant . Arthur said he 'd join us in a while . Good . That 's the supervisor 's vehicle below . I understand he visits there a lot . She can be charming . You gonna visit your son this afternoon ? - Yeah . - Where does he live ? In a small town outside of L.A. Dad ! Hey , Dad ! Dad ! Who are you today ? - Fernando Valenzuela or Steve Sax ? - Just Sean Donovan . Look what Josh 's got . How many Visitors does it take to change a light bulb ? - Tell me . - None . They like the lights out . How you doing , Josh ? - Hi . - All right . Check it out ! He 's got a squad vehicle ! And the action figures : The supreme commander and Diana . I wonder if they get a royalty . - He 's got a mothership at home ! - Yeah , I got them all . Can I get them , Dad ? Mom said we didn 't have the money but ... I 'll ask her about it . But in the meantime ... What is it ? It 's just something I picked up off the squad vehicle . - A real squad vehicle ? - Yeah . - You mean it came from the Visitors ? - Right . - Guy ! Check it out ! - Wow ! Let me see it ! In a minute , Josh . Hey , you guys , your pizza 's ready . Okay , Mom . You coming in , Dad ? In a second . - Look , Mom ! It 's from a squad ... - Your dinner 's getting cold . So what 's the matter now ? Nothing . It 's just tough competing with someone who rides in spaceships . What am I supposed to do ? Give up my job ? And what am I supposed to do ? Sprout wings , fly him off to Never Never Land ? How else can I compete ? With pizza . Why compete ? Why not do something of your own ? - Whatever happened to college ... ? - Please . Don 't start , okay ? You got a tissue sample from a Visitor 's skin ? How ? When Ben 's father was at the emergency room I found skin flakes on him from the Visitor who saved him . That 's terrific ! Dr. Metz 'll be delighted . Maybe . Good night , Julie . Ruth . Ruth , what 's wrong ? It 's Dr. Metz , isn 't it ? You really love him , don 't you ? Does he know ? I 'm just a piece of lab equipment . Starting tomorrow , we 're gonna go to work on him . We 'll make him see that Nobel 's not the only prize he 's got . - You 're darling . Good night , Julie . - Good night . A little shaky , Pop ? I 'll be all right . Just let me do it by myself . You got it . Hey , my man Ben , what it is ? " What it is " ? It 's bad grammar , my brother . Elias , when you gonna stop this poor man 's Richard Pryor act ? What you talking , man ? Brother , this ain 't no act . This here is pure D Elias , all right ? It 's pure D something . Look , man , can 't all of us be Dr. Kildare ? Know what I mean ? Uncle Tom . Come on , that Uncle Tom stuff doesn 't work anymore . You can be anything that you want to be . But first you gotta get rid of this tap-dance and two-bit crook routine and start to grow up . Oh , yeah ? Yeah , okay , well , once again we thank you Mr. Sidney Poitier . Thank you . Yo , Pop . How you doing , man ? You 'll never guess . The Visitor youth leader . You saw him ? Isn 't he a hunk ? I know ! I brought the phone outside so I could watch for him . Wouldn 't you just die ? I know ! And did you see his eyes ? They 're gorgeous ! Sure , I saw them . He looked at me the other day and I mean not just looking , but real sort of meaningfully . Like two ships passing in the night , like really romantic . I think he kind of likes me , you know , but he 's just shy . Excuse me . My life is over . - Did I startle you ? - No , no . I 'm Brian . Right . Robin . - Hi . - Hi . - I 'm sorry , I 'm a little nervous . - You are ? You are ? It 's not every day I meet somebody from another planet . You know , I never thought of that before . It must be just as weird for you . Not that you 're weird ... You know what I mean . Which one is Daniel 's home ? It 's the one over there on the right . - Thanks . - Sure . Oh , God . Would you like to take a walk ? Okay . - May I see that ? - Sure . Hey , hero ! Willie . Hello , Harmony . Everybody 's raving about how you rescued Caleb . They said your face was blistered , but you look okay . Hey , you want a burger ? No . Don 't you guys eat ? Sometimes . You go to movies ? No , I do not . Yet . Well ? - You are fun ? - What ? Feeling better ? Feeling fun ? Fine . Fine , yes . Fine ? Yeah , I 'm okay , yeah . Look ... - William . - William . I 'm sorry I called you a stupid alien . Oh , no . Here . The world was shocked today when Nobel Prize winner Dr. Maurice Jankowski of the Brussels Biomedical Institute in Belgium held a press conference to reveal an international conspiracy against the Visitors . It came to my attention first when Dr. Rudolph Metz in California asked to speak on what he called " urgent confidential matters . " Other colleagues here are also being approached by scientists . Biomedical and anthropological scientists from many nations who apparently are part of this insidious conspiracy . Their plans , simply , are to seize control of several motherships belonging to the Visitors . They tried hard to convince me that it was to protect the human race . Or keep such powers from the military on our planet . I do believe , however , that their motivation is by far more personal . Then Jankowski signed his statement listing those who introduced him to the conspiracy . When word began to spread of the Jankowski statement the international scope revealed itself as many scientists came forth to admit they had been approached or actually confessed that they were part of the conspiracy . Seen here is Dr. Jacques Duvivier , also a Nobel Laureate physician , and biochemist ... Damn scientists . ... who was detained by the French police and confessed to involvement naming many other scientists as his co-conspirators . It 's a vicious lie , I tell you ! You don 't need a warrant . Go on , search my files ! There 's nothing . You 'll find nothing ! What 's that ? I never saw that . No . It 's not true . I don 't know how this got there . It 's a lie , I tell you ! - Quinton 's still missing ? - And a half dozen others . The police don 't have a clue as to what 's going on . ... lends credence to the charges brought against them . Kristine Walsh , press secretary for the Visitor supreme commander , John , had this to say : The Visitors were shocked to learn of this conspiracy and fearful of the chaos which could possibly result . Not only would their own needs be impaired but all the benefits they plan to share with us could be endangered . Scientific seminars , which were to start next week , are postponed . Because it 's too early to determine how many scientists may be involved the U.N. has agreed to Visitor requests that all scientists and their families must register their whereabouts with authorities . Computers will be used to verify their registration . Abraham , don 't get so wound up . Nothing 's going to happen . Not to you or your family . They 're not doctors or biologists or even scientists . You 're not involved . Anyway , it 's going to pass . That 's what I said in 1938 back in Berlin . But this is different . Is it ? The supreme commander wants to make it clear that while he 's sure all scientists aren ' t part of the conspiracy it is still difficult to ascertain which of them may or may not be . While international police have scoured scientific files for facts on the conspiracy startling evidence is being found that many scientists have had breakthroughs in research which they 've suppressed . Senate Medical Affairs Committee Chairman Raymond Burke said : Yes , indeed . I do have evidence that new and revolutionary cancer treatments do exist and have existed for some time along with many other breakthroughs which apparently our scientific friends kept quiet about and haven ' t shared with us . - Why ? I won ' t speculate , except to say there 's a lot of money to be made in research grants . Excuse me ... I 'm sorry I 'm late . Dr. Metz is really hurting , and Ruth has completely disappeared ... - Take your time . They called to cancel dinner . Honey , you must be really disappointed . Yeah . Think you 'll still get their account ? I don 't think so . They were too polite . You know ? I don 't understand this . I mean , how can they treat you like that ? Denny , do you think it 's me ? They know that I 'm a biochemist and a med student ... No , no . How could it be you ? Well , you seem a little too polite . Yeah , I saw this before . So ? Something struck me funny , but I couldn 't figure it out . All night , I 'm trying to sleep and suddenly it hits me . Look . It 's a tape of him at that science fair last year . Remember when he autographed that book for my old man ? Yeah . Don 't you see , Mike ? He used his right hand . And yesterday he used his left hand . - So he 's ambidextrous ? - No , no , he 's not . And neither is Duvivier . I checked . No , Mike . Until this week , they were both right-handed . Something very strange is going on here . Come on . I 'm not very good at this . Brian , what 's it like out there ? It 's magnificent . Very peaceful . Which one 's yours ? Right there . It 's the brightest . It 's in the constellation you call Canis Major . Must be strange to be so far away from home . Yeah , it is . But new friends make it easier . I 'm glad . Hi , Robin . - Daniel . - Hey . How 's your father ? He 's fine . You know , it must be pretty tough nowadays being a scientist especially an anthropologist . Yeah . - Hi , Daniel . - Hi . How are you ? Good . Her father 's an anthropologist , huh ? - You didn 't know ? - No . I had no idea . Yeah . Shouldn 't we just take the squad vehicle like we usually do ? They won 't know we 're there . We 've got a better chance of seeing what 's going on . Okay . They got the chemical loaded onboard . Get ready . Now ! Mike . - Come on . Come on . - I can 't ... I can 't get my foot up . Come on . I got you . Come on . Damn ! Tanker unit 14 . Stand by for venting operation . Tanker unit 14 . Stand by for venting operation . What a waste of time , bringing these chemicals here and dumping them out . Tanker arrival schedule is as follows : From Los Angeles at 2100 hours . From Santa Barbara at 2114 and 2142 hours . From San Diego at 2150 , 2200 and 2215 hours . All tanker units , check in for late changes in assignments . All tanker units , check in for late changes in assignments . Every continent will soon be under our domination . You must be pleased . Well , let 's just say that it pleases me to serve our leader with whatever minor talents I possess . Our leader is very pleased with your conversion process . Yes , but you know how impatient our leader can be . Even with you ? I thought that given the intimacy of your relationship with him , he might ... Be very careful , Steven . I just hate to see him make you so distressed . He doesn 't understand my conversion process is limited . It doesn 't work the same on every human . No , but when it does work as with Duvivier , Jankowski and the others , it 's remarkable . Yes , it is . They actually believe that a conspiracy exists or even that they 're part of it . And of course the evidence that we planted reinforces their beliefs . The operation is working perfectly . Scientists are being ostracized , disorganized throughout the world . The problem is , our leader then says , " Why not convert them all ? " He doesn 't understand the human will is much tougher than we bargained for . To convert them all would take forever . However , we will continue to refine the process . Yes , I 'm sure you will , successfully . We must find the most effective and efficient methods to be used against them . I don 't think our leader could have chosen anyone who could do a better job than you . Particularly given the success of the previous one . Well , as long as we can keep the public 's confidence ... I 'm tired of these drills . Let 's go before we have to sit through another . Emergency situation on level 73 . All units to standby alert . All units to standby alert . Emergency situation on level 73 . All units to standby alert . - This is L.A. - Okay , we 've got a hot one . I 'm testing on the PL . Hello , New York ? You got me , Burt ? Okay , listen . We 're going to do an interrupt . Alert all the affiliates , full network . Yes . Mike Donovan has a tape that 's supposed to knock our socks off . We 're feeding bars and tone right now . - It 's leaving . - Dan , go check your patching . - Stand by , that special tape . - We 're ready . Why would they take that chemical to the mothership then just dump it into the air ? - Beats me . Here they come . - Get double mikes on that right now . - You sit right there . I 'll do the setup , intro you , we 'll roll the tape , and ... - Andy , please ? - Right . - 30 seconds . - 30 seconds . Now , give me lights now . Camera one ... Now I 'm gonna start with two , then come to one . You okay , Mike ? Ten seconds . Quiet on the line ! You 're breaking up a little . Five , four ... Five seconds , four , three , two , one . - New York , take your slide . - And cue announce . - The following is a special report . - Coming two , and ... Take two . Cue , please . An astonishing occurrence just took place on the mothership just off ... - What happened ? - Hello , New York ? Hold on , we 've got a problem . - What 's going on ? - Hello ? They what ? - We 've lost Ma Bell . - We 've what ? Somebody 's pulled ATT right out from under us . They pulled the plug . The whole damn network 's off the air . And so are both the others . What 's that , Burt ? Hello ? Hello ? And now I 've lost New York . Dead , dead . No , I cannot . Here 's something . This is Kristine Walsh . The Visitors ' supreme commander , John , is here to make a statement . My friends throughout the world first , I must thank the leaders of each your countries who have graciously turned over all their broadcasting facilities to us to help avoid confusion in this crisis . I 'm sad to say that there has been a carefully coordinated and quite violent attempt by the conspiracy of scientists to commandeer control of our facilities at many key locations around the world . I don 't believe it . This is Dupres . Have we been hit ? Oh , thank goodness ! Damn scientists ! Two dozen other places suffered similar assaults . - The loss of life has been enormous . - I don 't believe this . - Both to your people and ours . - Believe it . In addition , thousands have been wounded , and we 're fearful there will be more attacks . I 'm going to the hospital . The outbreak is so widespread and so dangerous that most civilian members of your governments have asked us for protection which , of course , we 're more than happy to provide . They 're safe aboard our ships , and we 'll take good care of them . I 'm also very sorry to report that this man , in whom we had placed considerable trust Michael Donovan of the U. S. , has proved to be the biggest traitor to your peace ... - No ! It isn 't true ! He is armed and dangerous ... I want my tape . I 'm setting up to copy it now . - Man , we are in big trouble . - Tell me about it . Get going . Mike . Mike , your tape . Your national leaders have suggested that a state of martial law will be most helpful at this time . And we agree . Police at local levels will work with Visitor patrols . And we will also ask the help of all our Visitor Friends units . - All right ! - We anticipate this crisis will pass relatively quickly . In the meantime , friends , I and my fellow Visitors will do our best to see you through it and maintain control . There will be more announcements later . Gotta go ! It 'll pass . You heard what he said . Right , Dad ? Around the nation and the world Visitors are keeping order and making friends . Police and military forces in each country are cooperating fully . The clear and present danger still exists , however from the terrorists who brought about the need for martial law by their assaults . These attacks by scientist conspirators are continuing sporadically and violently around the world . - In Buenos Aires last night ... - We 've been lucky not to have that happen at our plant . Several cryogenic storage tanks containing the synthetic chemical were damaged . But heroic efforts by the Visitor technicians saved them and the lives of fifteen workers . How could they be faking all this ? - The movies do it all the time . - The curfew set at 8 : 00 still must be maintained . It isn 't fair . I want to go out some nights . - Why ? Daniel comes by here . - It isn 't Daniel that I want to see . Who is it , Robin ? Never mind . Of course the military are cooperating fully . They 're all under house arrest . Mrs. Maxwell ? Hello , Sancho . What 's the matter ? I can 't work for you no more . Why not ? - It 's ... - Well , tell me . The other people that I work for know I work for you . They don 't like it . But why should the other people ... ? Because my husband is a scientist ? They say I could either work for them or for you . - My family , they ... - That 's okay . Never mind . I understand . - Polly ? Are you hurt ? What happened ? - I got in a fight . Bunch of jerkos beat up on me because I won the science fair . - What ? Yeah , they wrecked it up , said I was just a dirty little scientist 's kid . You should have seen them . - How many were there ? - Four . What happened to your teachers ? Didn 't they see ? One did , but he just walked the other way . I guess I better fix my bike . Thanks , Mr. Bernstein . - You going to Manhattan to your folks ? - No , I can 't get through to them . It 's better if you don 't know anyway . I 'll get the rest later sometime . - Don 't you think you 're overreacting ? - No , Denny . I don 't want you losing any more accounts . - Look , we don 't know for sure ... - No , we don 't ! And that 's the really nasty part . They 're always so polite . But we know , don 't we ? Anyway another biochemist , Phyllis ... You remember her ? Well , she didn 't show today . And nobody 's heard from her . Just like Ruth and all the others . Maybe she just went away . Just like this . - Maybe she was taken . - There 's no truth to those rumors . Shall I stay then ? You should do whatever makes you happy . See you , Denny . And there were even fewer incidents of violence today . People are starting to report in to authorities when they suspect someone might be involved with the conspiracy . This early warning will save countless lives . - The supreme commander urges ... - I 'm so tired of her face and only hearing one side of what 's going on . Well , the truth is the truth . Then why not let others say it ? Hey . Don 't you think you 've had enough of that ? No . I do . Come on , Stanley . There 's the newspaper too . Yeah . And it says exactly what she says . Sometimes it 's word for word . It 's not just that . Look at these bills . The price is up on everything . To make a long-distance call you need a special permit . Even then , most times you can 't get through . - You always said this would pass . - Yeah . It 'd better hurry up before we sink . I want things back the way they were . - Where 's Daniel ? - Well , he 's not out looking for a job . Stanley you 've got to be more careful what you say . - What ? In my own house ? - Yeah , but he lives here . You know how involved he is with them . - But he shouldn 't have the right ... - I 've heard stories . - Rumors . - Stories about how his group member had actually ... Done what ? Informed ? On his own parents . And they disappeared . - Lynn , I hardly think that Daniel ... - Well , I hardly think so too , but ... I mean , what 's to inform on ? We 're not scientists and I didn 't say anything . - You were very critical of her and them , of the newspapers , everything . - Of him . - He shouldn 't drink that much . That 's not all you said . Look , all I said was , I was tired of hearing ... Hearing one side of the news . Their side . Well , I meant hearing only one opinion . No , not that . I meant ... You don 't really think he 'd call them , do you ? Where have you been , Daniel ? Just to the bathroom . You think he 's lying ? I don 't want to go to the mountains . I hate our place up there . - It 's so boring . - Get in the car . Try to understand . Too many things are happening . A scientist your dad worked with was arrested for conspiracy . - Polly got beaten up at school . - And Quinton is still missing . Why don 't we stay and fight ? It 's not that easy , Poll . Oh , God . But Daddy is no conspirator . Neither were they . - Get in the car . - All my friends are here . - Yeah , especially ones in uniform . - Shut up , Polly . - I can stay with Karen and her family . - Right now , Robin ! Please ! It 's all right . I think . All right . We know what 's happening . Totalitarian suppression of the truth . Not only on TV , but they 've got the papers too . We are under martial law . And paranoia . Everyone , especially scientists , are scared to death . Or disappearing . Like my partner or any other cop who refused to cooperate with the Visitors when they requested that we help them maintain order . They took another doctor and his family from my building . Why are they anxious to arrest so many scientists ? They must think that scientists might find a way to stop them . There 's no way to stop them . There 's too many . No . There has to be a way . Well , there is . We organize . Any complex structure , like our bodies , for example starts with individual cells . The cells will reproduce , expand , and join with others . - That 's lovely in biology , but ... - Listen , Brad ! I 'm sorry . Look , I know that we 're embryonic . There 's only just a handful of us . But we 're not the only ones huddled in the dark like this . I know there are others like us all around the world . We 're not the only ones who want to fight . She 's right . Now what we 've got to do is find the others who feel just like we do . Then we all go out and look for more and more . We need equipment for a lab , communication . And a place to put it , headquarters . And we should find out who 's closest to the Visitors and get them on our side . Like ... What 's her name ? That Kristine ... Walsh , yes . Now she 's surely on the inside . Maybe too much on the inside . - One of us should contact her . - I think so . I 'll find her , and find out if we can trust her . Why don 't we meet back here Thursday night ? - Fine by me . - Sounds good to me . And everybody has to bring at least four other people with them . - Agreed ? - Agreed . Hello , Uncle Pedro ? - Uncle Pedro ? - It is you . Buenas noches . - Tony , cut the ... - We 've been having phone trouble . Understand ? Trouble with the phone . You must be all " tapped " out . You got it , Uncle . The repairmen even came to check things out . They smelled your cooking all around here . Would they like to get their hands on your burrito ! - Yeah , I 'm sure they would . - Yeah , but I like Italian food much better , remember ? Yeah . Yeah , I remember . Don 't let me keep you . I know you have to run . Good luck . Another one . - Why do they keep us in the city ? - Makes it easier to find us . Why is it so important to them ? We 're not sure , Poll , but it is . Stop that guy ! - I said , halt ! - Get that guy ! - Another scientist ? - No , but he tried to help one cross . - So he 'll share their treatment . - Easy , he 's wounded . That 's his fault . He breaks the law , he pays the consequences . - This is different . - No , it ain 't ! A crook 's a crook . Nothing 's changed except the guys who give the orders . How are we getting through ? - Are we gonna fight ? - No . Now where are we going ? - Who 's gonna help us ? - I don 't know . I do . Turn the car around . The big bad doctor needs my help ? How come ? - You 've got contacts on the street . - Damn right , I do . But ain 't you always putting down the streets ? But times have changed , Elias . Well , the streets ain 't . They ain 't changed a bit . There 's just another man out there to be " the man . " Matter of fact , the streets is getting a lot better . You can make a lot of money now , in a hurry . - Black market . - Pardon the expression , brother . Any idea how much fresh fruit 's going for these days ? And beef ? I make more selling hamburger than I did selling reefer . You can keep on doing all that you want , Elias . - Some of us are trying to fight . - Why fight it ? - It don 't affect me , I 'm making money . - Elias . What is happening is wrong . Says who ? - I need your help . - What about when I needed yours ? - I was always there for you . - Oh , yeah . Just a little unapproachable . - The golden boy . - Man , that 's only in your head . If I heard it once , I heard it a thousand times : " Why can 't you be like brother Benjamin , the doctor ? " Now you need my help ? That 's right . I 'd sure like to , but you see , I gotta go to the medical library and do my studying . I 'll catch you later , brother . Helen and Stanley never use this place . It 's just for storage . It 's gross . We can 't live here , it 's filthy ! We can clean it . - There 's no way it 's ever ... - Robin ! That 's enough . It 's fine , Abraham . Thank you . - Forgive my daughter ... - It 's all right , I understand . I 'm not sure I do . Father , can I talk to you , outside ? - I can 't believe you brought them . - They have nowhere to go . Their house is being watched . So is ours , by Daniel ! Tell them we 're sorry . You don 't understand , they must stay . They need a place to hide . - And why is that ? - Because the father is a scientist . He 's a suspect and a fugitive , making them even more dangerous . - They have to stay . - Get them out of here before ... - I won 't ! - Then I will ! No , you won 't ! We had to put you in a suitcase . In a suitcase . You were 8 months old . That 's how we got you out . - I know this story , Father . - No , you don 't ! You don 't . Your mother , auv shalom your mother didn 't have a heart attack in the boxcar . She made it with me , to the camp . I can still see her , standing naked in the freezing cold . Her beautiful black hair was gone . They 'd shaved her head . I can still see her waving to me as they marched her off with the others , to the showers . The showers with no water . Perhaps if somebody had given us a place to hide ... Don 't you see , Stanley ? They have to stay or else we haven 't learned a thing . Mike ! My God ! You scared the hell out of me . - I 've been so worried for you . - I 've been worried for me too . Why are they so hot to capture you ? - Because I 've seen their faces . - What ? - You don 't believe me , do you ? - It 's incredible ! - Reptilian , with tongues that ... - It 's true , I 've seen it . - I believe you think you 've seen it . - Think ? Damn it . I work closely with them every day . It 's hard to ... Be objective . I 'm wasting my time . - Don 't leave yet . - Why ? Can I see the tape ? It 's hidden . Mike , listen . We started this together , and it 's possible you 're right . Maybe I did get too close to them . It 's funny I always wanted to be closer to you . You 've got a funny way of showing it . I 'd really like another chance . Thanks . Hey . Danny ! You scared me ! - What are you doing here ? - They fell asleep so I snuck out . I couldn 't stand it in your pool house another minute . - Our pool house ? - It 's too small for one , but five ? It 's totally outrageous . You 've been drinking . Yeah . - With Brian ? - He was there . He doesn 't drink . I don 't think he can hold it . Did he ask about me ? No . Is he supposed to ? Well , I thought he might . Not tonight , he didn 't . You know , I 'm very glad to see you . - You look very pretty . - Other nights , though ? - What ? - He asks about me other nights ? Sometimes , yeah , I guess . He wondered where you went . We both did . Me , especially . Until I found out you were in my pool house . Remember when you said you didn 't want to die until you 'd made love ? - Do you still feel that way ? - Sure . Is he still a virgin , do you think ? Who ? Brian . This will help us find some of their weaknesses . I hope so . Let 's get a move on . I 'm not sure they bought my act . Where 's Ben ? Go ! Go ! Go ! Wake up , Julie ! Let 's go ! What are you stopping for ? I 'm going back for Ben ! - You 're crazy ! - No , we can 't leave him there ! Julie ! Julie ! Oh , my God ! Julie , no . No . Go on , get out of here . I 'm not gonna make it . Six bucks For a dozen clucks Is Caleb here ? - What happened ? - Ben 's been hurt . What went down ? We stole lab equipment and they shot him . What ? The Doc ? Stealing stuff ? You ought to come to me , man . I 'll show you how to do it . They got you too ? I should get an ambulance . No . No ambulance . We 've already made our diagnosis , haven 't we , doctor ? I don 't understand . Why try to pull a heist without your little brother 's expertise ? - But we did it . The truck did get away . But look at you . You a wreck ! - Man , you can 't do this stuff alone ... - Is Papa here ? No , uh ... He ain 't get here yet . But now listen here , man . Do I try doctoring ? Of course not ! The next time you go boost some stuff you 're gonna come to me first . I 'll show you how ... Ain 't nothing to it , it 's like lifting these here eggs , man . Shoot . I sound like Papa now , " shoot . " He 'll be here any minute now . Elias . Anyway , you gonna come to me , right ? We 'll take them on together , yeah . The two of us , The Bad Taylor Brothers . Elias . They 'll say , " Whoa ! What blew through here , Jack ? " The Bad , Bad Taylor Brothers , oh , yeah . Taylor Brothers , man . The doctor ! The doctor and , uh ... The doctor and the other one . The other one . Elias . No ! The doctor cannot die . Sure , the other one can die . He can die , but not not ... not ... Ben . Not Ben . Damn it , Ben . Damn it . No ! If you 're going to do it , do it right . I 'll show you . You understand ? For victory . Go tell your friends . Subtitles by SDI Media Group ripped by mrTLU Hello ? No , don 't shoot me ! Josh ... - Where is everybody ? - They 're gone . - How long ago ? - About three days . You 've been alone since then ? Well , you 're not anymore . What happened ? Lots of people tired of what the Visitors are doing . Bunch of ranch hands came in and threw a bomb underneath a squad vehicle with the local supervisor guy inside . They blew it up and killed him . But he was shouting about how we 're in America and they weren 't gonna stand for these Visitors . And there was clapping and cheering and then there were these lights pouring down . Some people screamed and ran . Some shot guns . They kept on coming , the shock troopers . A lot of them . A whole lot of them . I lost my mom and dad but Sean 's mom grabbed me . She pulled us into the house . But there were these lights and noise . She slammed the door . Get back ! But they were everywhere outside . And then I saw these awful eyes . That 's okay , kiddo . You 're all right now . Then what happened ? They broke through the door and took them . He fought really hard and kicked at them to leave his mom alone . He fought and said his dad would get them . He was real brave , Sean was . But me ... I ... I hid back in the closet . I was scared . I 'm sorry , Mr. Donovan , I should have helped . Josh . Hey , come on . Don 't beat yourself up about it . There wasn 't anything you could 've done . What happened then ? They took them , everybody , to the square . There was a lot of shouts and crying . Then the lights were gone . And so was everybody . Everyone but me . " I only have escaped alone to tell thee . " Mr. Donovan , will I ever see my mom and dad again ? You bet . Josh , when I came to visit Sean I brought him something . Yeah , I remember . What 'd he do with it ? Do you know ? Yeah , it 's over here . What is it ? It 's a key . That 's gonna get you into what ? The belly of the whale . Come on , kiddo . Champagne for breakfast . Classy . - Where 'd you get it ? - From a local merchant . One who knows the value that a friend can be . And now a toast . To my engagement . What ? - To whom ? - To Robin Maxwell . But she 's gone away . Well not that far away , huh ? What does Robin think about this , Dan ? She doesn 't know about it yet , but ... See , I want her . Just like I wanted this champagne . And I will get her , won 't I ? Otherwise , I 'll just have to turn her whole damn family in . - Come on ! - Stop it ! You 're crazy . - I 'm not going ! - Come on ! - You freak ! - Daniel ! Daniel ! Daniel ! Caleb I am sad for you . We both are , Caleb . You get away ! I don 't want you here . But , Caleb ... - Go on ! Get out of here ! - He felt bad , and we wanted ... - You go on ! - Papa , come on . You people killed my boy ! You killed him . Now you get out of here ! Willy , come on . You tried . You go on back where you belong ! You people killed my boy ! Go on now ! Go on ! - But they 'll grant my family amnesty ? - It 's just like we arranged . Who is this family that 's in hiding ? It 's just a bunch of scientists . Shalom . - Is everything all right ? - It 's okay so far . Now we have to run the roadblock . Katie , honey , be quiet . It 's all right . We won 't make it with her crying . Okay , try these . They 'll help . - You come prepared . - I 've had some experience at this . - Hello ? - Hello . I have a question . If I thought I knew someone , a scientist perhaps was being smuggled out what should I do ? Well , I 'm not interested in a reward , of course . Katie , be quiet . Mom , Dad , keep her quiet . Hi , officer . - How are you ? - Where are you headed ? - El Tepeyac . - What ? El Tepeyac . El Tepeyac ? What ? I know all the towns around here . Where 's El Tepeyac ? It 's a restaurant , best food north of Ensenada . El Tepeyac ? I never heard of it . What 's the story back there ? No story . It 's okay . - Let 's move it out then , Pedro . - Thank you , officer . Careful . It ain 't gonna be easy , walking down here with that cane . Well , I 'm gonna have to get used to it . The tunnel runs down underneath the city connects up with some really nifty places . It ain 't the Beverly Hills Hotel . But there 's a lot of space down underneath . Some bums sleep here sometimes . We 'll take anyone we can get . I 'm glad to hear that . - The electricity doesn 't work . - I 'll handle that . - It 's okay then ? - It 's perfect . Dynamite . While you get moved in I 'll go rap with the Angels . This is their turf . - You think you can get them to help ? - You kidding ? You are talking to the Henry Kissinger of East L.A. - I 'll catch you later . - Okay . Elias . Yes . Hello . Yeah , this is Daniel . Who took my father ? They said " arrested " ? But they promised amnesty ! They said ... Yeah , hi . Lynn Bernstein , please . Wait . What time did she go to lunch ? Well , that was four hours ago . She 's not at home ! Yes , I 'm sure ! I 'm at home alone . Here comes our boy , back from El Tepeyac . He had somebody hidden back here , but they 're gone now . What is it ? Just a token of appreciation for your hospitality . Oh , Steven ! So , what 's the plan ? Well , Josh needs to stay with Fran . It 's okay with me . - Do you like spaghetti ? - Sure . Okay , we 'll get along just fine . - There 's a rebel camp in the hills ... - Like in El Salvador ? Just like El Salvador , where a bunch of doctors and others are holed up . There 's another downtown , but I don 't know where . We 'll find it , but first I want to see what this unlocks . They must have some Achilles ' heel , something we can use against them . We need to find out where the people are who disappeared . Daniel . I know you must be disappointed in me . My superiors decided to take your family in for questioning . They 'll be home soon . - They will ? - You have my word . Grandfather too ? He isn 't well . He 's with our doctors . They 're very good . They hope to help him feel better . How about you ? You feeling better now ? Yeah , I guess so . Well , I have some news that ought to help . You 're getting promoted . To my second-in-command . - What ? - Yes . Congratulations . That 's not all . When I informed Diana of your loyalty she gave me this reward for you . - Brian ! - I 'm glad you like it . And I 'm proud to have you in my unit . You know how to use that thing ? I 'm sort of winging it . This thing controls intensity . How strong a jolt it shoots . You prime it here . - It has extra batteries ? - They 're rechargeable . - Clever , those Japanese . - Look out ! How we gonna handle him ? How about the direct approach ? Excuse me . Hello . Look , I 'm sorry to bother you , but I 'm on my way to Korea and my shrimp boat gets a flat tire so I really need an inner tube . Okay , let 's go . Go ! Go ! All right . - Same drill . - Only this time , I won 't trip . - I can 't make this stupid thing work ! - The safety 's here ! Go . Up the catwalk . Go ! Mike , my eyes ! Tony . Tony ! Okay , Roy , it 's around the corner , the second door on your left . Juliet Parrish ? Robert Maxwell , anthropology . - My daughter , Robin . - Hello . They said you were organizing here . - They did ? - Yeah . Well , come on . We 're preparing to bring down all of our equipment from the mountain camp . We 're trying to make it livable or just plain safe , at least . - Julie , where 's the water cutoff ? - I don 't know . Try that room . - I don 't think any place is safe . - You 're right . The picturesque toilets are through here . - I 'll bet . - Thi is our poor man 's BBC . The kitchen 's over there . - Robin , be careful of the elevators . - Yeah , I see the holes . Well , she 's thrilled to be here . It 's not the Galleria . She 'd go crazy at the mountain camp . A lot of good stuff up there . Electronic micro ... All of our sophisticated equipment . We gotta get it down here . - Julie , where do you want this ? - Julie , what about this ? Elias , put that in that room . Brad , over there . Robert , here . Julie , I can 't find the water cutoff . Here , let me help you . Juliet , are you all right ? Oh , Ruby . I can 't handle this . I 'm supposed to be a scientist a doctor not a plumber or a rebel . They all look at me like I know what to do . And you 're just as lost and scared as we are . More . " These are the times that try men 's souls . " I 'll tell you why we look to you . You 're a natural . A natural leader . - I don 't feel that . - You don 't have to . All you need to do is trust your instincts . Trust yourself as much as everybody else trusts you . If I can 't ? Fake it . We won 't know . How you feeling ? How would you feel ? Where 's Tony ? - She 's ready for him . - Who is ? Several times you 've caused a bit of trouble , Mr. Donovan . Nothing to the trouble you 've caused , lady . " Lady . " That 's a good one . You 'll soon have no more worries , Mr. Donovan . I 'll be with you in a moment . You know , Diana , rather than putting Mr. Donovan away he might prove very useful to us as a convert . My instincts say he 'd be too difficult . That 's why I decided not to bother . Take him to the final area . But you thrive on challenges . I do , but I like better odds . That 's curious . I would 've thought you 'd find the difficult game far more interesting . But you 're probably right . I don 't think even you with your abilities could ever turn this head of his . Martin , wait . Don 't take him to the final area just yet . Perhaps I would enjoy the challenge of converting him . Well , as you wish , Diana . - We 'll get you out of here . - You 'll what ? It 's dangerous , but no more dangerous than if you stay . You talk her into converting me and you expect me to believe you ? I was buying time , you idiot . I 'm sorry , Mike . Look some of us , a very few of us don 't believe in our leader or his plans . - What are his plans ? I can 't say now . I gotta get you out . - With Tony . - That 's impossible . - I 'm not leaving him without ... - Mike ! It 's too late for Tony . - What 'd they do to him ? - Quiet ! If that dragon lady can bend minds , why does she need a blowtorch ? Conversion is a very difficult and time-consuming operation . When Diana needs some information then she 'll do what 's most effective . And efficient . And she likes to do it . God Almighty ! Help us . Be ready . Take your shoes off . Your shoes . Hurry ! Martin couldn 't come . You 'll wear my uniform . - I 'll never ... - It 'll stretch enough to fit you . - You don 't look like an iguana . - What ? Bad taste . - Why are you doing this ? - Because it 's right . - How many more of you are there ? - Not enough , not nearly . One less if you don 't hurry . What happens next ? Take these . A shuttlecraft is on the way up now . You can slip aboard . Keep your glasses on and your mouth shut . Yeah . My voice is sure a tip-off . Can you use this ? Like the rifle , yeah ? Thanks . - All right , now shoot me . - What ? It 's necessary , or they won 't believe my story . - Will you live ? - Of course ! At least I hope so . I don 't even know your name . It 's Barbara . Godspeed , Mike . Please , do it . Do it . Trooper Units 14 and 15 to the Red Room , please . Trooper Units 14 and 15 to the Red Room . Trooper Unit 36 and Technician 31 to squad shuttle in Bay 12 , Level 1 . Trooper Unit 36 and Technician Unit 4 to squad shuttle in Bay 12 , Level 1 . No , I don 't mind the duty down there . Do you mind the duty down there ? He says he doesn 't like all those angry people . But I tell you , they don 't bother me . They bother you ? I haven 't seen you around before . What unit you with ? Nice talking to you . Aren 't you gonna say goodbye ? You hear me ? I want to hear you say goodbye . Goodbye ! Yo , Angels , come here ! Check it out , man . You hardly ever see them alone . Julie wants to study one close up . Find out what makes them tick . What say we pay the Visitor a visit ? All right . Hey , Julie ! Julie , special delivery . Pulverize him ! - Let 's get this dude . - Let him out . Be careful of his gun . Okay ... You bunch of stupid bozos ! - What are you doing ? - He doesn 't sound like one . - He 's not . - Damn right I 'm not ! - But he might be a sympathizer . - Sympathi ... I don 't suppose you have a bandage I could borrow ? Over here . Put your guns down , for God 's sake ! Who 's in charge ? I guess you 'd say that she is . Who is ? Her ? That kid ? She 's one smart kid . Are you coming ? Or would you like to keep on bleeding ? You walk with a cane . - You get hurt too ? - A little . - Where 'd you get the uniform ? - They had a sale . - You did that on purpose . - I did not . Where 'd you get the uniform ? Aboard their ship . A couple of them helped me to escape . They did ? Why ? Beats hell out of me . - Sounds like a setup . - I don 't think so . - Don 't you have any Novocain ? - I do , but I have to save it . You are a doctor ? - More or less . - That 's comforting . You don 't think it 's a setup , why ? They seemed so damn sincere . - They 'd have to , wouldn 't they ? - Look , you weren 't there , okay ? - And why were you ? - I 'm highly motivated . That 's enough ! I 'll tell you why I went up there . My kid and my ex-wife and everyone in their damn town are up there ! They got my partner up there , and God knows what they did to him . And you call me a sympathizer ? Kid , I ought to take those bandages and shove them right down your throat ! I guess we should believe you . You seem so damn sincere . That 's it . I wouldn 't , Mr. Donovan . You see , we 're also short on bandages . You have to understand our point of view . You were among the first to board their ship . You worked in close proximity with them and three nights ago you saw Kristine Walsh . You escaped from somewhere no one has escaped from , wearing ... I know what I 'm wearing . How 'd you know about Kristine ? Because I was there . Outside . - Now , you talk about a setup . - Yeah , I know , I saw it . - Why didn 't you warn me ? - I didn 't know whose side you 're on . I 'm on the right side , kid , believe me . Well ... Why don 't you tell us what you know . I 'd have to get my tape to show you , but that 's close . Reptilian . Amazing . No , not really . This could 've happened here on Earth . What ? Up to 60 million years ago the reptiles ruled the Earth . Bam , a meteor punched a hole through the crust that sent up dust and heat . - Iridium . - That 's right , iridium . Iridium was in that meteor . It kept out the light , kept in heat , like the greenhouse effect . As the temperatures went up the biggest , smartest reptiles who weren 't equipped to handle heat , like mammals are , died . So , what are you saying , man ? We just gotta turn up our barbecues and poof ! Kentucky-fried horny toad . Extra crispy . It 's not gonna be that easy , but heat can be effective as a weapon . Cold sure ain 't . The Visitor who saved me took 300 degrees below . Right , they 're equipped to handle cold . Light , bright light might be a weapon . The eating scene you described is consistent with the biochemistry of reptiles we know . Yes . Live food , or just-killed animals . What about the poison spray ? It 's not unusual for reptiles on Earth to spray their venom . From the symptoms you described , I 'd say it 's neurotoxic . It attacks the nervous system . That causes your heart to flutter and affect your lungs . Can you make an antidote ? Well , it 's possible . Procedures for creating an antivenin are standard but we need a quantity of venom . - Let 's add that to the shopping list . - Sure . Oh , God . There 's just so much ... You know what we ought to do ? Define our overall plan of resistance . - Right . - I agree with that . Well , how about this ? Firstly , to undermine all Visitor activity . Impede their progress every way we can . And secondly , I think we should find out what their hidden goals are . - Hidden ? - Sure , they 've lied to us before . And brainwashed a few of us with that process you described . It 's safe to figure there 's something deeper still going on . And thirdly , we have to find out more about their physicality . Find their weaknesses . And let people know of their reptilian nature . - That tape is important . - Yeah , I 'm hip . The more people know about how alien they are ... The more they 'll want to fight . And last , and probably the most important that we establish contact with others like us . They 're there , in every city in the world . We have to organize coordinated efforts . That 's the only way we stand a chance of winning . Robin ? Now , let 's make a list of targets to consider . Robin ? Robin ? Hold it ! Against the wall . You 're out after curfew , buddy . Another Maxwell . Brian , good to see you . We 'll talk more later , Kristine . - I need your help . - Of course . It 's come to my attention that you 've developed a relationship with this young lady . - I know her , but ... - Is she attractive to you ? Not like you are . I see now how you rose through the ranks so quickly . I 'm quite serious . That 's very interesting because I 've had my eye on you for some time . How can I be of service ? Presently . I want your help with an experiment . Medical experiment . Unusual . Involving you and her . Please , just tell me where my daughter is . Where is she ? She 's our prisoner . - In here ? - No , the mothership . - Is she all right ? - I 'm told that depends on you . - What ? - There 's some information we need . - We think perhaps you can help us . - I don 't know anything . Camp in the mountains . - I 've never heard ... - We know of its existence . We need its location . I can 't do anything about it ... It 's too bad . I 'm awfully sorry for your daughter . No , wait ! My wife , my other daughters are up there . In the mountains ? Yes . Yes . In the camp . I can 't . Oh , dear God . Come with me . I think I can help you . I understand your anguish and your dilemma . I have children too . Suppose I guarantee you the camp will not be taken until a certain time . That would enable you to get them out beforehand . You 'd do that ? I would . But if you warn the others , Robin would be quite severely ... No ! No , I won 't . But , can your people take the camp without ... ? Hey ... It can be done quite easily without harm being brought to anyone . We won 't get there until , what ? Four o 'clock tomorrow ? Yeah , okay . You have my promise . As a father . I 'll get the maps . Brian ? Just take it easy . It 's okay . It 's okay . - I won 't let anybody hurt you . - I want to go home ! I gotta hand it to you , doc . You really pulled this bunch together . You juiced them up . I 'll tell you something else , though . You better save some for yourself . Thanks . Okay , everybody . One last time . We all know our assignments then . Diversionary actions should start at 1 : 00 . - They 'll know we 're there . - One o 'clock , then . Followed by our main assault against the armory at 2 . We 've got to remember our prime objective ... To rip off as many weapons as we can get . Right . We have to arm ourselves so we can protect our equipment when we get it from the camp . Listen , while you 're breaking loose all hell here I 'll infiltrate the ship to ... - Find your family ? Hopefully . But also get a handle on their plans . That 's pretty suicidal , isn 't it ? My partner always said I should 've been a kamikaze pilot . He 's still up there . We 'd hate to lose you , Mr. Donovan . I 'd hate to lose me too . Good luck . To all of us . Let 's do it . Wait , Juliet . How about a prayer ? How about it , Caleb ? I thought that you would ... All right . Well , Lord . We really need Your help on this one . Please , help each and every one of us to do the best we can . A lot people are depending on us . That 's all . - Amen . - Amen . Amen . Let 's do it . - That 's 12 : 30 . - I know it , brother . Hurry up ! I ain 't never messed with stuff like this before . I 'd just as soon not get my hands blowed off , okay ? Now , let 's go set the others . I hate when people do that ! Boy , I 'd like to stick it in their hair ! Hey , hold on . Wait for me ! Willy ! Willy ! All right , right away ! Back onboard , everybody . There 's trouble at the plant ! Come on ! This one 's for Abraham . - Stand back . - Get the extinguisher ! Get some extinguishers ! Isolated incidence of violence mostly explosions at Visitor installations are being reported all across Los Angeles . They may be part of an effort by the scientific conspiracy . Boy , my hands are sweating . Are you scared too ? I hope we don 't have any casualties . I 'd hate to lose one of us . Hang on ! Watch for the snakes on the roof ! Guns and ammunition ! Check it out ! Let 's get it loaded first . Juliet ! I 've got to warn the camp of an attack . - What ? - I tried to protect Robin . - But too many lives are at stake ! - Robert ! - Donovan ! - What 's going on with those tanks ? - You 've been there ? - Yeah . It 's all water . Where 's the chemical ? There 's no chemical . Then what the hell are ... ? Oh , my God . That chemical 's just a smoke screen . - It isn 't what you want at all . - You 're right . You 're here to take the water . It 's the rarest , most valuable commodity you can imagine . Unlike most planets , ours included Earth is blessed with an abundance of it . We need it , Mike , for our sustenance . To power fusion generators and the leader 's weapons . - We could 've shared it ! - It was proposed . But our leader wants it all . Other ships like this one are already on their way . The plan will take a generation . But he 'll have his way . And the Earth will become a desert and humanity will die . No . There won 't be any people left by then . There 's something else I have to show you . Look I 'm sorry about the ... Where 's Grandpa ? We never saw him . What 's with your arm ? I burned it . What is this ? They 're your people . Dead ? No . Just this side of death . Metabolism slowed extraordinarily . Diana 's ... work . The people who disappeared . My son . Is he here somewhere ? Or in another ship like this one . Why are they being taken ? Stored like this ? Why not just killed ? The leader needs them living . Some of them will be made into troops for battles with his enemy . - What enemy ? - The force that defeated him before . So that makes them our friends . - I don 't know ... - It 's something to go on . You said some of them would be his troops . Not all ? - No . - What about the others ? In addition to the water there 's another basic shortage on our planet . Food . How did someone like that get to be your leader anyway ? Charisma . Circumstances , promises . Not enough of us spoke out to question him until it was too late . It happens on your planet , right ? I guess it does . How 's Barbara ? She 's recovering . This won 't be pleasant for you . Are you sure you ... ? Yeah . I 'm sure . Tony . God ... Diana ? Yes . She 's authorized some medical experiments . I want to kill her . You 're not alone . Who are you ? A friend . They tried to make me talk . But my grandfather he fought with Zapata . I tell them nothing . I spit in their faces . Where 's your friend ? There 's a hostage being used to make her father a spy . Here he comes . Get in . I don 't have time to explain . - Let 's go . - You 're coming too ? - I can 't stay here . - You ought to . - But ... - You 'd be more valuable to us here . I 've gotta fly this for you . I 'm a pilot . I 've ridden in enough of them to try . - Listen , Mike ... - Martin . Say it , man . You 're scared . It 's very dangerous for me now . And he looks like a day at Disneyland ? Barbara and Tony were scared . We 're all scared . Every damn one of us . But we 've all gotta help out in the best way we can . Now , how about it , man ? Are you game ? It 'll tend to overcompensate . The control 's are very sensitive . But if you let it , Mike , it 'll almost fly itself . I hope so . Hey . I 'm proud to be your friend . I hope we live to be old friends . Hey ! Hold it ! Hang on ! Get another fighter and follow me . If they don 't kill us , my driving might . Pull up ! Yeah , I 'm working on it . All right ! Let ' em have it , Cisco ! Sancho . Well done , captain . Their mountain camp . This should give your troops a little exercise . It 's not 4 : 00 ! They lied ! They lied to me ! Billy , get over here ! Kathleen ! Polly ! Come on , Sancho ! Nail that sucker ! I will , I will ! But I need a little luck . We 're gonna hit the mountain . Not with any luck . Where 'd you learn how to fly ? Kathleen ! Move back ! Move back ! Bring them over here ! Come on , we 've gotta stop them ! All right , get them out . We gotta save all the equipment in that building , okay ? Let 's go , let 's go ! Hurry up ! Come on ! Yes ! All right ! All right ! Here they come again ! Come on , hurry up ! Julie . Julie ! Help me ! Do something . Do something . Please ! What should I do ? Another pass . I want to get that woman . - Return to base ! - Right away . All units return to base . Kathy ! Kath . Kathleen . Oh , God ! This wasn 't going to happen . Not to anyone . I tried to fight them . Where are the girls ? Daddy ! Mama ? We fought good , huh ? Yeah . We fought good . Mr. Donovan . It 's good to see you . Yeah . You too . What did you find out ? We did it ! We saved all the equipment ! You see them run ? How about this lady ? Right in the thick of it ! Shoot ! They ain 't so tough ! - Huh ? - They ain 't so tough . Are you crazy ? We 'd better focus on destroying as many motherships as we can . Destroying ? I don 't think you get the picture , doc . There are thousands of people up there . Our people . Yes , I understand . Elias , get the trucks out ! And we will try to save as many of those people as possible ... - Try ? - Yes , try . Damn it , you 've got to understand . We may have to sacrifice the thousands to save millions , even billions . I don 't like it any more than you do . I hate it . My life has been devoted to saving lives . We may not have a choice . Brad ! Help me get the equipment out . Elias ! Get the other trucks going . Get the ammunition out first . Then the biomedical equipment . Well , it 's not the Holiday Inn but it 'll have to do . You sound like Mom . Guess I 'm gonna have to , huh ? - You still feel sick ? - Not like this morning . Every morning for the past three days in a row . Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . I 'm fine . - Was it scary up on that spaceship ? - Yeah . It was really scary . But it was also very interesting . Okay , everybody , go brush your teeth . You sound like Mom , all right . Oh , really ! That 's the most outrageous story I 've ever heard . Whether you believe it or you don 't the truth is my son , your grandson and 10,000 others are all prisoners of your " friends . " Don 't tell me you don 't know what went on in this town all week ! Of course I do . I 'm not a fool . - Then why won 't you ... ? - I 'm a survivor , Michael . Or I never would have gotten here from that Louisiana hick town or survived your father 's drunkenness . It 's not the same thing ! I 'm a survivor . If you 're going to be , you better change your ways . I know the Visitors aren 't saints . But they 're in power . They are power . You and I are in unique positions . Don 't you see that ? Why not take advantage of ... I can 't survive at the expense of other people . It 's not right . When I was a kid there was a woman who taught me what was right and what was wrong . I wonder whatever became of her . Halt ! I said , halt ! - Why have you come here ? - Please . - I have to talk to you . - You have to leave ! Our son may be here any minute , understand ? - He 's the one ... - I know . - But the Resistance needs your help . - What ? We want this to be a safe house , where we can hide occasionally . You 're out of your mind ! We 've already been arrested once . Look how he 's suffered . They tortured him . And our son is an informer ! Yes , and all of that is why this is an ideal place . Lightning 's struck here once already . Believe me , they won 't look here again . We can 't ! They only let us go so that we would warn others of what could happen . - The next time , they might kill us . - They killed Kathleen ! We 've got to stop them . I decided that it would be all right for me to die myself if millions , millions could be saved ! Oh , please ! My God , we need your help . We can 't . I 'm truly sorry . We can 't . We simply can 't ... What 's this ? My father left it for us . Read it . Read it to him . " My dear family : It 's painful knowing that I 'll not see your faces anymore . But I must take this stand for what I know is right . You may think that an old man wouldn 't be afraid to die but this old man is very frightened . I 'm hoping that I 'll find a little of your mother 's dignity and strength . So far , I 'm as frightened as a child who fears the dark . But we must fight this darkness that is threatening to engulf us . Each of us must be a ray of hope and do our part and join with the others till we 've become a blinding light triumphant over darkness . Until that task is accomplished , life will have no meaning . More than anything , you must remember which side you 're on and fight for it . Your mother and I will march beside you holding hands again . We 'll sing your song of victory . You 'll feel us in your hearts . Our spirit ... " " Our spirits will be with you always . And our love . " We have to help . Or else we won 't have learned a thing . Okay , Kenny , start it now . So that 's a call for help ? Yep , in mathematical code . If the Visitors have an enemy , they should be smart enough to translate it . How long will it take to reach them ? Depends on how far away they are . - A few years probably . - God , years ? We 're gonna keep on transmitting day and night , right , Kenny ? I hope they got their ghetto blasters tuned in on us . And if they do , let 's hope they 're on our side . So we just hang in there for a couple more years , right ? But the reality we have to face is that help may never come . We may end up having to rely completely on ourselves . We done all right . The first battle 's been won . That 's right . But the war is just beginning . Subtitles by SDI Media Group ripped by mrTLU

 Well , you worn worse , Thomas . You worn none at all . It 's just your promiscuous Luck , friend . Nice choice . Roomy ... or damp . Oh , blooming ' boots ! Good county for cadging , this used to be . ( INVISIBLE MAN ) It 's a rotten county . And pigs for people . ( CHUCKLES ) Ain 't it just ? - And those are exceedingly ugly boots . - Ar ! Audacious ugly ! Ugliest in the whole blessed universe . But which pair to keep ? I 'm blessed if I know . Has ... ? - Where are you ? - Don 't be alarmed . You 'll be alarmed in a minute , you silly fool . Where are you ? Are you buried ? Oh ! It ain 't no time for playing the fool . I could have swore I heard a voice . - Hey ! - Don 't be such a fool ! Lord preserve us , he 's here again . Come out ! Well ? Be a man and show yourself . None of your ventriloquising with me , no ! I 'll knock your block off if I could see you . _ ( SLAPS ) \ Eh ! Oh ! You 're off your chump , Thomas . It 's the drink . It 's fretting over them blessed boots . ( INVISIBLE MAN ) Neither one thing nor the other . Do you really think I 'm just your imagination ? What else can you be ? Then I 'm going to throw stones at you until you think differently . Oh ... Where are you ? Hey ! Ow ! Oh ! No ! Eh ! Stop ! Do you still think I 'm imagination ? - Hey ! - Struggle any more and I 'll throw this stone . All right . All right , mate , I 'm done . Where are you hid ? How do you do it ? It 's very simple . I am invisible . Tell me something I don 't know . Stones flinging themselves , stones talking ? - I 'm beat . - I am invisible . That is what I want you to try and understand . Invisible . - Yeah , but where ? - Here ! About two yards in front of you . I 'm not one of your ignorant tramps , you know . You 'll be telling me next you 're thin air . But I am ! At this moment you are looking straight through me . Eh ? I am a human being like you . I need food and drink and covering , like you . I 'm solid but I am invisible . What , you ... you mean real , like ? Quite real . Give us a hand of you , then . \ ( SLAP ) \ Eh ! You ... you made me jump , grabbing me like that . Heh ! Oh , ghost . If this don 't beat cock-fighting . You are there . Oh ! I can see a rabbit clean through you , half a mile away . How 'd you manage it ? How 's it done ? - It isn 't half so wonderful as you think . - Eh ? - ( GASPS ) - Listen to me . I need your help . I need clothes and shelter and other things : important documents . Don 't you knock me about no more ! You just keep off . You broke my bottle , you very near broke my toe . Now , why should I help you ? ( GASPS ) - ( GULPS ) - You have a job to do . And I have chosen you for it . You are an outcast , like myself . Help me and I will do great things for you . An invisible man is a man of power . And if ... if I won 't ? If you betray me , I shall kill you . Cipher , it 's all in cipher , Padre . - ( CLATTERING ) - ( MR HALL ) Tut ! Oh , dear . I think it much wiser , Mr Hall , to leave those things untouched until the constable has made a thorough search . - Anything might explode . - I 'm very sorry , sir . There 's no name on the flyleaf , nothing at all to give us a clue . - ( VICAR ) I see . - ( SNIFFS ) ( INVISIBLE MAN WHISPERS ) The closed door . There are figures in this one . And judging by the letters of some of the manuscript , it might be in Greek . - ( INVISIBLE MAN ) Ask for the tap room . - Eh ? - What is it ? What do you want ? - ( INVISIBLE MAN ) The tap . - Mr Hall ... - Erm ... this the tap ? - No . No , it ain 't . - Right you are . - Stand clear . - Come along , now . - ( CONSTABLE ) Sorry , sir . - No need to pull my arm . It 's black and blue . - ( HALL ) Very sorry , sir . - My nerves are all on edge . It made me jump , the door opening like that . - A tramp , I should judge . - Or a sailor . - Sailor ? - Stand clear : a nautical term . Tramp or sailor , I think we should make certain we are safe from further interruption . Everyone outside the Church credits clergymen with a knowledge of Greek and Hebrew originals . I confess mine is of the very flimsiest . I understand none of this . William ? Er ... do you think we should take these notebooks to Professor Longman ? - Come on , out ! - How about a drink of water ? - No , we 're closed . Come on . - Give over pushing . - You just clear off and don 't come back . - Oh , yes ! - Measuring . - Eh ? Judging the size of his head . He ain 't got one . Well , the fact remains I could see right down his sleeve . Have you ever seen a really good conjuror , William ? - Oh ! - Hallucinations are so easily produced . I won 't argue with you . We 've thrashed this out a hundred times already . Dear friend , even if I cannot believe this absurd invisibility story , there certainly seem to have been some very strange things happening in Iping lately . - And now we 're Left with these . - Indeed . Look at this entry . Russian , would you say ? Well , it 's certainly not Greek . - William ! - What the ... ? ( INVISIBLE MAN ) Don 't move or I 'll brain you both . Listen to me carefully . Besides being invisible , I am a very strong man . There 's not the slightest doubt I could kill you both and get away quite easily . - Do you understand ? - Yes ! - Do you understand ? - Yes , yes . For pity 's sake , man ! - ( CHOKING ) - Very well . - If I let you go , you must do exactly as I tell you . - ( COUGHING ) Yes ! W-Where are you ? Since when did you learn to pry into an investigator 's private memoranda , Doctor ? Since when did you learn to invade the private rooms of a man of misfortune ? We meant you no harm , sir . When I came into this room , I did not expect to find it occupied . However , your presence has solved another problem . I returned for my three books , gentlemen , but I also need clothes . Though the days are warm enough for a man to run around stark naked , the nights are not . Your trousers , please , Doctor . Certainly not ! I really have no wish to handle you roughly . Do as he says ! ( VICAR AND DOCTOR SHOUTING ) - ( VICAR ) This is disgraceful ! - That ain 't right . - William ! - Yes , all right , Padre ! - William ! - I 'm very sorry . Would you mind getting out of my way ? - Mr Jaffers ! - ( DOCTOR SHOUTING ) ( MUMBLES ) Are you all right ? Dr Cuss , sir ? - ( BANGING FROM INSIDE ) - ( DOCTOR ) It 's Locked ! - Eh ? - There 's rum noises coming from the parlour . - What 's going on in there , George ? - Listen . - Is he speaking to us ? - ( DOCTOR ) This is dreadful ! - ( INVISIBLE MAN ) And the socks ! - Window ! - Ooh ! Here ... Reverend Bunting ? - Do you mind ? ( ARGUING CONTINUING INSIDE ) ( INVISIBLE MAN ) Quick , man , quick ! Take them ! - Mr Jaffers ! - You come back here ! Hey ! Stop , thief ! Hey ! Hey , you ! Here , hurry up . He 's getting away . Hey , stop ! Good heavens , Mr Jaffers , he 's getting away from us . Head him off at the bridges ! Right ! Oh ! Oh ! Reverend Bunting , please ! I believe he 's gone ! All right , Mrs Hall . Good heavens , Padre . Do something to cover yourself . - ( HAMMERING ON THE DOOR ) - All right , Mrs Hall , all right ! ( JAFFERS ) I 'll catch you , you know ! You won 't escape ! ( INVISIBLE MAN ) Come on ! Mr Jaffers ! ( INVISIBLE MAN ) Well ! What are we going to do now ? Nobody knew I was invisible until those floundering yokels exploded my secret . Now it 'll be all about . It 'll be in the papers . Everybody will be looking for me . - Everybody will be looking for me ! - You ? ( THOUGHTFULLY ) Yes ... - Yes , indeed . They will be looking for you . - ( FOX BARKING ) ( INVISIBLE MAN LAUGHING ) You 're a poor tool , Marvel , but the fact is , I shall have to make use of you again . - I 'm a miserable tool . - You certainly are . I 'm the worst possible tool that you could have . I ain 't strong . I 've got a weak heart . All that business , running away ... I could 've dropped any moment . Look , I haven 't got the strength for what you want . I 'll stimulate you . Look ... I don 't want to mess up your plans , but I might , out of having a weak heart . You 'd better not . Well , it ain 't justice . What do I get out of it ? You do what you 're told , Marvel , and I 'll see you right . I wish I was dead . ( LAUGHS ) ( SNORING ) ( BIRDSONG ) ( INVISIBLE MAN STIRS AND COUGHS ) ( CHATTER ) Seasonable weather . Ar . Books ? Here . Books . - Extraordinary things in books . - Mm . I believe you . Extraordinary things out of them , too . Likewise . - Extraordinary things in newspapers . - Oh , yes ? ls there ? - In this one , anyway . - Mm ? There 's a story here about an invisible man . In America , was he ? No , not America . Here ! ( CHUCKLES ) What 'll they think of writing next , then , eh ? Well , when I say here , I don 't mean here in this place . No ! I mean hereabouts . ( COUGHS ) What 's he been up to , then , this invisible man ? ( LAUGHS ) Well , every blessed thing , according to this ! Makes me regular uncomfortable , the thought of him running about at Large . I mean , who knows what he can do ? I mean , he could trespass , burgle , rob ... He could pass through a whole cordon of police as easy as you and me 'd give the slip to a blind man ! Er ... Does it say he 's got any pat ? Eh ? R don 't say he 's got any pat ? - I suppose . - Ain 't one of his sort enough for you ? " Although several attempts were made to secure him , " he succeeded in escaping . " But not until after a desperate ... alternation " in which he inflicted serious injuries . " That 's a pretty strange story , eh ? ( CLEARS THROAT ) Where ... where is he now ? Well , " From certain evidence , " it is supposed he has taken the road to Port Burdock . " - Port Burdock ? - That 's down the road away ! Here , he 's on his way here , Bertie , the Invisible Man ! Is that a fact , is it , now ? Here , you haven 't finished your stew ! - No , l-l-l-l 've got to get going . - Hold on , mate . - Marvel ! - My Lord , he 's here ! - He 's here ! - Who 's here ? Marvel , you pot-bellied son of an old boot ! - What 's all this ? Now go and close that door ! - He 's inside ! He 'll kill me ! - No , no ! You 've got to help me . - Get off ! ( YELLS ) Harry ! Harry , what 's your game , eh ? - Let go ! - I didn 't try to give you the slip . - Come on , let her go . - Don 't hurt me , mister ! You wouldn 't hit a Lady , would you ? ( INVISIBLE MAN SNARLING ) Invisible Man ! ( TERRIFIED SHOUTING ) I felt him ! He went right by me , honest . ( LANDLORD ) All of you , quiet ! Quiet , I said ! I will have quiet . He 's gonna kill me ! He 's gonna kill me ! Harry ! Harry , are you all right ? - Never mind about me ! - He 's in here , Bertie . - Eh ? - He 's prowling about ! - He 's as artful as the devil . - I 'll soon put paid to that . No , that won 't do , Bertie . That 's murder ! Well , I 'll just aim at his Legs . - Not in here ! You 'll kill us all . - Supposing he ain 't got no legs ? - Don 't talk so daft . - ( INVISIBLE MAN ) Marvel , you liver-faced worm ! Gawd help me ! He 's back ! - He 's here ! I got him ! - ( MEN ) Where ? Where ? - No , I ain 't . - Whoo ! ( HARRY ) He 's gone ! After him ! - ( MAN ) Come on , then ! - Ah , stop that ! Stop that , man ! Come on , get back . Hey , you ! ( LANDLORD ) You out there ! Hold on ! - Hold on ! - ( PANTING ) ( TWO GUNSHOTS ) - ( GUNSHOT ) - Aah ! ( GASPING ) Aahhh ! ( WHIMPERS IN PAIN ) ( BREATHING STEADIES ) ( EXCITED CHATTER ) Hey , it 's all right . You can come out now . He 's gone . Yeah ... But he 'll .. he 'll be back . He 's after them books . Ooh , God help me .

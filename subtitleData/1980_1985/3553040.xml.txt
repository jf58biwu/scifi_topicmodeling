I ought to give you the tip . Look at it this way : In 100 years , who 's gonna care ? The 12-gauge auto loader . That 's Italian . You can go pump or auto . The .45 long slide with laser sighting . They 're brand new . Just got them in . That 's a good gun . The beam comes on , you put the red dot where you want the bullet to go . You can 't miss . Anything else ? A phased plasma rifle in the 40 watt range . Just what you see , pal . The Uzi nine millimeter . You know your weapons , buddy . Any one of these is ideal for home defense . So which will it be ? All . I may close early today . There 's a 15-day wait on the handguns but the rifles you can take now . You can 't do that . Wrong . Hi , baby . Yeah , it 's me . I need you to come pick me up . My bike just broke down . I don 't care ! Come get me . What- - ! Mort ? Hey , man . You got a serious attitude problem . Mort , where are you ? Come on , what are you doing ? Sarah Connor ? Yes ? I 'm on my break . Carla 's got my station . Sarah , come here ! It 's about you ! I mean , sort of . It 's incredible . You won 't believe this . - Sit down . You 're gonna love this ! - What ? - -has been compiled from several witnesses . Once again , Sarah Connor , 36 , mother of two shot to death in her home this afternoon . You 're dead , honey . - -if you 're into sound , for the greatest sound around ... We 've got woofers , tweeters , and digital audio and compact laser discs . We 've got graphic equalizers and sound balancers that adjust- - Sorry . Hello ? First , I 'm gonna rip the buttons off your blouse , one by one . Then , run my tongue down your neck to your bare , gleaming breasts . Then , slowly slowly pull yourjeans off , inch by inch . Ginger , it 's Matt . And lick your belly in circles , further and further down . Then , pull your panties off with my teeth . Who is this ? Oh , God . Sarah ? Oh , Jesus . I 'm sorry . I thought you were- - Can I talk to Ginger ? Sure , Bunky . It 's the creep . First , I 'll rip the buttons off your blouse , one by one ... . - Calm down . - You fucking pigs ! Wait till I get my hands on you ! Get off me ! Sit down , fella . Ed ! - What do you got ? - Dead girl . I can see that . Sarah Ann Connors , secretary , 35 , shot six times at less than 10 feet . - Large caliber weapon- - - You know , these work . - What 's this ? - Dead girl Two . Sent over from the Valley division this afternoon . I 'm sure there 's a point to all of this . Look at the name , Ed . " Sarah Louise Connor . " Is this right ? You 're kidding me . The press will be short-stroking it all over . A one-day pattern killer . I hate the weird ones . So ... . Better than mortal man deserves . - Ginger , have you seen Pugsley ? - Not lately . - Did you check messages ? - I thought you did . Hi , Sarah . This is your mom . There you are , young man . You mind your mother . Bye . Hi , Sarah . Stan Morsky . Something 's come up and I won 't be able to make it tonight . I just can 't get out of it . Sorry . I 'll make it up to you . Call you in a day or so , okay ? Sorry . Bye . That bum . So what if he has a Porsche . He can 't treat you like this . It 's Friday night , for chrissake ! I 'll live . I 'll break his kneecaps . Well , Pugsley still loves me . Don 't you , baby ? God ... . It 's disgusting . I 'm gonna go to a movie . - You and Matt have a good time . - We will . - You too ! - Okay . Damn it , Matt ! Oh , shit . Are you aware the killings occurred in the same order as in the phone book ? What can I tell you guys ? No comment . But lieutenant , we 've got two murders- - That coffee 's two hours cold . And I put a cigarette out in it . - Did you reach the next girl ? - I keep getting an answering machine . - Send a unit . - I did . No answer and the manager 's not home . - Call her . - I just called her . Call her again . Give me a cigarette . Hi , there . Fooled you . You 're talking to a machine . But don 't be shy . Machines need love too . So talk to it . And Ginger , that 's me or Sarah will get back to you . Wait for the beep . Same shit . I can hear it now . He 'll be called the goddamn " Phone Book Killer . " I hate these press cases . Especially the weird press cases . Where you going ? Make a statement . Make these jackals work for us for a change . If I can get on the tube by 1 1 : 00 maybe she 'll call us . Well ? - How do I look ? - Like shit , boss . Your mama . This just in . Police have announced the name of the second murder victim which took place today . lncredibly , the names of the victims are virtually identical . 7wo hours ago , 36-year-old Sarah Ann Connor was found dead in her apartment . - Change this . - Sarah Louise Connor ... Don 't touch it ! ... was slain earlier in her home . Police are refusing to speculate on the similarities and no other connection between them has been established as of yet . We 'll have more on this late-breaking story as it comes in . - You got a phone ? - It 's in the back ! Four-fifty ! You 've reached the LAPD emergency number . All our lines are busy . If you need a police car sent out to you , stay on the line . 2-1 1 in progress at Bob 's Liquor , corner of 3rd and Tavern . Shoo ! Go on ! I 'm gonna make a belt out of you . Don 't make me bust you up ! Hi , there . Fooled you . You 're talking to a machine . But don 't be shy . Machines need love too . So talk to it . And Ginger , that 's me or Sarah , will get back to you . Wait for the beep . Ginger ! It 's Sarah ! Pick up ! I 'm at this place on Pico Boulevard called TechNoir . I 'm really scared . I think there 's somebody after me . I hope you play this back soon . I need you to come and pick me up . The police keep transferring me . I 'll give them another try . The number here is 666-9176 . Call me . I need your help . It 's her . - Sarah Connor ? Lieutenant Traxler . - Look don 't put me on hold or transfer me ! - I won 't . Tell me where you are . - A bar called TechNoir . I know it . It 's on Pico . Are you all right ? Yeah , but I think there 's a guy following me . Listen carefully . You 're in a public place . You 're safe till we get there . But stay visible . Don 't go outside or to the restroom . - I 'll have a car there in a minute . - Okay . Hey , that guy didn 't pay ! Come with me if you wanna live . Come on ! This is 1-L 19 . I got a hit-and-run felony . Suspect vehicle late-model grey Ford , headed westbound on 7th . He 's really moving . I 'll need an ambulance at 7th and Broadway right now . Hold it ! All units watch for a late-model grey Ford last seen westbound on 7th and Broadway . Hold on . Are you injured ? Are you shot ? Do exactly what I say ! Exactly ! Don 't move unless I say . Don 't make a sound unless I say . Do you understand ? - Do you understand ? ! - Yes ! Please , don 't hurt me . I 'm here to help you . I 'm Reese . Sergeant , Tech-Com . DN 38416 , assigned to protect you . You 're targeted for termination . Intercept at National and Olympic . Come in , 1-L 19 . This is 1-L 19 . Westbound on Olympic , approaching Overland . This is a mistake . - I didn 't do anything . - No , but you will . It 's very important that you live . This isn 't true . How could that man get up after you- - It 's not a man . A machine . A Terminator . Cyberdyne Systems model 101 . A machine ? Like a robot ? Not a robot . A cyborg . Cybernetic organism . No , he was bleeding . Just a second . Get your head down ! All right , listen . The Terminator 's an infiltration unit . Part man , part machine . Underneath , it 's a hyper-alloy combat chassis . Microprocessor controlled . Fully armored . Very tough . But outside , it 's living human tissue . Flesh , skin , hair , blood . Grown for the cyborgs . - What do you want from me ? - Pay attention ! I gotta ditch this car . The 600 series had rubber skin . We spotted them easy . But these are new . They look human . Sweat , bad breath , everything . Very hard to spot . I had to wait till he moved on you before I could zero him . Look I am not stupid , you know . They cannot make things like that yet . Not yet . Not for about 40 years . Are you saying it 's from the future ? One possible future . From your point of view . I don 't know tech stuff . Then you 're from the future too , right ? - Right . - Right . Cyborgs don 't feel pain . I do . Don 't do that again . - Just let me go . - Listen and understand ! That terminator is out there . It can 't be bargained with . It can 't be reasoned with . It doesn 't feel pity or remorse or fear . And it absolutely will not stop ever until you are dead . Can you stop it ? I don 't know . With these weapons , I don 't know . All units , grey Ford suspect vehicle found in a parking structure at 4th and Broadway . Location , lower level . Suspect described as male , white , six feet , 26 years , green overcoat . Last seen on ... . Reese ? Why me ? Why does it want me ? There was a nuclear war . A few years from now all this this whole place , everything it 's gone . Just gone . There were survivors here there . Nobody even knew who started it . It was the machines , Sarah . I don 't understand . Defense network computers . New . Powerful . Hooked into everything . Trusted to run it all . They say it got smart . A new order of intelligence . It saw all people as a threat , not just those on the other side . It decided our fate in a microsecond . Extermination . Did you see this war ? No . I grew up after . In the ruins . Starving . Hiding from H-Ks . - H-Ks ? - Hunter-Killers . Patrol machines built in automated factories . Most of us were rounded up . Put in camps for orderly disposal . This is burned in by laser scanner . Some of us were kept alive to work loading bodies . The disposal units ran night and day . We were that close to going out forever . But there was one man who taught us to fight , to storm the wire of the camps . To smash those metal motherfuckers into junk . He turned it around . He brought us back from the brink . His name is Connor . John Connor . Your son . Your unborn son . Drive ! Reese ! No , Reese ! No ! No ! They 'll kill you . You in the Cadillac ! Let me see your hands . Now . Get out of the car ! Drop to your knees ! Out of the car . Drop to the ground ! All units PC-907 . Suspect is in custody . Cancel fu · her assistance . Sarah try to drink some of this . Are you sure it 's them ? I mean , maybe I should look at the bodies . They 've been identified . There 's no doubt . Oh , God ... . Ginger ! Oh , kiddo . Sarah this is Doctor Silberman . Hi , Sarah . I want you to tell him everything Reese told you . - Do you feel up to that ? - Yeah . I guess so . You 're a doctor ? Criminal psychologist . Is Reese crazy ? Well , that 's what we 're gonna find out . So , you 're a soldier . Fighting for whom ? With the 132nd , under Perry . From ' 21 to ' 27 . That 's the year 2 · 27p That 's right . - Then I was assigned to Recon ... - This is great . ... under John Connor . - Who was the enemy ? - A computer defense system built- - Damn . Sorry . Built for SAC-NORAD by Cyberdyne Systems . I see . And this ... Killing him , in effect , before he 's even conceived . Sort of retroactive abortion ? Silberman cracks me up . He had a guy in here that burned his Afghan . - He screwed it first- - - Shut up . Why didn 't it kill Connor then ? Why this scheme with the Terminator ? It had no choice . Their defense grid was smashed . We 'd won . Taking out Connor then would make no difference . Skynet had to wipe out his entire existence . Is that when you captured the lab and found- - What is it ? The time displacement equipment ? That 's right . The Terminator had already gone through . Connor sent me to intercept , and they blew the whole place . How do you get back ? I can 't . Nobody goes home . Nobody else comes through . It 's just him and me . It 's just him and me . Why didn 't you bring any weapons ? Something more advanced ? Don 't you have ray guns ? Ray guns . Show me a piece of future technology . You go naked . Something about the field generated by a living organism . - Nothing dead will go . - Why ? - I didn 't build the fucking thing ! - Okay , okay . But this cyborg , if it 's metal- - Surrounded by living tissue ! Oh , right . Right . This is great stuff . I could make a career out of him . See how clever this is ? It doesn 't require proof . Most paranoid delusions are intricate , but this is brilliant ! Why were the other two women killed ? Most records were lost in the war . Skynet knew almost nothing about Connor 's mother : Her full name where she lived . They just knew the city . That Terminator was just being systematic . Let 's go back to- - You have heard enough ! I 've answered your questions , now I have to see Sarah ! That 's not up to me . - Then why am I talking to you ? - Because-- - Who 's in authority ? - Please-- Shut up ! You still don 't get it , do you ? He 'll find her ! That 's what he does ! That 's all he does ! You can 't stop him ! He 'll wade through you , reach down her throat and pull her heart out ! Doc . Let go of me ! Sorry . So Reese is crazy ? In technical terminology he 's a loon . Sarah , this is what they call body armor . Our TAC guys wear these . Stop a 12-gauge round . This other individual must 've been wearing one . Feel that . Go ahead . What about punching the windshield ? He was probably on PCP . If he broke his hand , he wouldn 't feel it for hours . - There was this guy- - See this ? - Here . Thank you . There 's a couch . Stretch out and try to sleep . Be an hour before your mom gets here from Big Bear . I can 't sleep . Try . It may not look it , but that couch is very comfortable . You 'll be perfectly safe . We got 30 cops in this building . Thank you . - Good night . - Good night . I 'm a friend of Sarah Connor . I was told she 's here . - Could I see her ? - No , she 's making a statement . Where is she ? It may take a while . You want to wait , there 's a bench . I 'll be back . What the hell was that ? Gunshots ! - Is it a terrorist ? - Let 's go ! Stay here . - Let 's get out of here ! - Come on ! Move it , move it , move it ! I got him ! Watch him ! - Automatic weapons ! - Come on , let 's go ! Fire ! Fire ! Ed . Sarah ! Reese ! This way ! KFLB news time , 4 : 36 . In the top story , the largest law enforcement mobilization in California history is underway . Police in five southern counties are in a massive manhunt- - Take this . All right , let 's get this off the road . You cold ? Freezing . Reese you got a first name ? Kyle . ... what 's it like when you go through time ? White light . Pain . It 's like being born , maybe . Oh , my God ! I caught one back there . You mean you got shot ? It 's not bad . - We gotta get you to a doctor . - It 's okay . Forget it . What do you mean , forget it ? Are you crazy ? Take this off . Jesus ! See , it passed right through the meat . This is gonna make me puke . - Would you just talk about something ? - What ? I don 't know . Anything . Just talk . Tell me about my son . He 's about my height . He has your eyes . What 's he like ? You trust him . He 's got a strength . I 'd die for John Connor . At least now I know what to name him . Don 't suppose you know who the father is so I won 't tell him to get lost when I meet him . John never said much about him . - I know he dies before the war- - - Wait ! I don 't want to know . So was it John that sent you here ? I volunteered . Why ? It was a chance to meet the legend . Sarah Connor . Who taught her son to fight organize prepare , from when he was a kid . When you were in hiding before the war . You 're talking about things I haven 't done yet in the past tense . It 's driving me crazy ! Are you sure you have the right person ? I 'm sure . Come on , do I look like the mother of the future ? I mean , am I tough ? Organized ? I can 't even balance my checkbook ! Look , I didn 't ask for this honor and I don 't want it ! Any of it ! Your son gave me a message to give to you . Made me memorize it . " Thank you for your courage through the dark years . I can 't help you with what you face , except to say the future is not set . You must be stronger than you imagine you can be . You must survive , or I will never exist . " That 's all . It 's a good field-dressing . You like it ? It 's my first . Get some sleep . It 'll be light soon . Okay . Talk to me some more . About what ? Tell me about where you 're from . All right . You stay down by day . But at night you can move around . You still have to be careful because the H-Ks use infrared . But they 're not too bright . John taught us ways to dust them . That 's when the infiltrators started to appear . The Terminators were the newest , the worst . It 's traversing your sector in search mode . 75 · meters north of your position . Let 's go . Reese . DN-384- - Right . Let him in . Our spotter 's got a bad paw , so we 're cutting short the patrol . Roger , Yankee 17 . You are cleared to return . Terminator ! Terminator ! I was dreaming about dogs . We use them to spot Terminators . Your world is pretty terrifying . Hey , buddy . You got a dead cat in there , or what ? Fuck you , asshole . Goddamn ! Thank you ! Is this enough ? Yeah , that 's enough . I don 't want to ask where you got it . - Coming . - We need a room . - All right . - With a kitchen . Have one with a kitchen ? I am dying for a shower . We should check your bandage too . Later . I 'm going out for supplies . Keep this . I can 't tell you where I am , Mom . I was told not to say . I need to know where I can reach you . You tell me to hide at the cabin like a fugitive and you won 't tell me what 's going on ? I am worried sick , dear . Okay . Here 's the number . - You ready ? - Yes . Go ahead . It 's 4 · · - 666- 1439 . Room nine . Got it ? - I 've got it . - I 've gotta go . I 'm sorry I can 't tell you more right now . I love you , Mom . I love you too , sweetheart . - Tiki Motel . - Give me your address there . What have we got ? Mothballs corn syrup ammonia . What 's for dinner ? - Plastique . - That sounds good . What is it ? A nitroglycerin base . It 's a bit more stable . I learned to make it when I was a kid . Make sure there 's none on the threads . Like this . Screw the end-cap on . Very gently . You must have had a fun childhood . That 's good . Six more like that , and I 'll get started on the fuses . He 'll find us , won 't he ? Probably . It 'll never be over , will it ? Look at me , I 'm shaking . Some legend , huh ? You must be pretty disappointed . No I 'm not . Kyle the women in your time what are they like ? Good fighters . That 's not what I meant . Was there someone special ? Someone ? A girl . You know . No . Never . Never ? I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . So much pain . Pain can be controlled . You just disconnect it . So you feel nothing ? John Connor gave me a picture of you once . I didn 't know why at the time . It was very old torn faded . You were young , like you are now . You seemed just a little sad . I always wondered what you were thinking at that moment . I memorized every line every curve . I came across time for you , Sarah . I love you . I always have . I shouldn 't have said that . Think fast ! Trade places ! Faster ! Drive faster ! Kyle ! Oh , my God ! - Whoa ! - Son of a bitch ! You stay here . Let 's get out of- - Get out . Kyle , come on . Get up . Help me . Come on ! Help me ! Get out ! Get out ! Get out ! Faster ! Don 't stop ! Run ! Sarah ? Kyle ! We did it , Kyle ! We got it ! No ! No ! Wait . What are you doing ? Cover . So it can 't track us . Come on ! Come on . No ! Kyle ! Come on ! - Come on ! - Leave me here . Move it , Reese ! On your feet , soldier ! On your feet ! Move it ! Back ! Go back ! - Run , Sarah . - No . Run ! Run ! Come on , motherfucker ! No , no ... . You 're terminated , fucker . Oh , Kyle ... . Tape seven . November 10 . Where was I ? What 's most difficult is deciding what to tell you and what not to . But I guess I have a while before you 're old enough to understand . They 're more for me at this point , just so I can get it straight . Ah , fill her up . Should I tell you about your father ? Boy , that 's a tough one . Will it affect your decision to send him here , knowing he is your father ? If you don 't send Kyle , you can never be . God , a person could go crazy thinking about this . I suppose I will tell you . I owe him that . Maybe it 'll help if you know that in the few hours we had together we loved a lifetime 's worth . What did he say ? He says , " You 're very beautiful , se · ora . " And he 's ashamed to ask you for five dollars for this picture . But if he doesn 't , his father will beat him . Pretty good hustle , kid . What did he just say ? He said there 's a storm coming in . I know .

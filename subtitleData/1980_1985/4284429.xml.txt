 ( SINGING ) Deck the halls with boughs of holly Merry Christmas , boys . Merry Christmas , General Washington . Seize that man ! He 's a rebel spy . Come on , Bogg . Amy and I would like Jeffrey to live with us . It 's a home . And he needs that . What do you think you 're doing ? What I should 've done a long time ago . Giving you a home with a mother and father who love you . No ! BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! CAROLERS : ( SINGING ) O come , all ye faithful Joyful and triumphant O come ye , O come ye to Bethlehem Come and behold him Born the King of Angels O come , let us adore him O come , let us adore him O come , let us adore him Form it up , then . Get a leg on , Schmidt . Christ the Lord Sing , choirs of angels Sing in exultation ... Tonight being Christmas Eve , we should pay special attention to any kind of unusual activity . This is just the time for the colonist rebels to play one of their dirty little tricks . Schmidt and Mueller will patrol the south of town . Danziger 's group will take the west . Bohm , the east , Hertzman , up north . If we hurry with our patrols we might make it back for a little reveling of our own . Lord , we greet thee Born this happy morning Will you stop that confounded singing and get out of here ? I can 't hear myself think ! Sorry about that , Colonel . We thought you could use some holiday spirit . I could use some peace and quiet . NATHAN : We will give you as much of that as we can . Merry Christmas , sir . ( SINGING ) Joy to the world , the Lord is come Let earth receive her King ( PLUMMETING ) Let every heart ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Prepare him room And Heaven and nature sing Where are we ? ( BEEPING ) Jersey . New Jersey ? I guess . How old could Jersey be in 1776 ? 1776 ? What 's wrong ? That a bad year or something ? Come on , Bogg , you couldn 't have skipped that class . It 's the Revolution . The Revolution , right . Pancho Villa . The American Revolution . George Washington ? Right . It 's pretty peaceful for a revolution . Well , it 's gotta be here somewhere . All we got to do is find it . Yeah , well , let me tell you something about revolutions . If you stay around long enough in one place they 'll find you . Hey ! Get out of there ! Hey , there 's a bomb in there ! A bomb ? Jump , kid ! Hurry . Follow me . You all right ? Yeah . Let 's go ! We 've got to run ! Get them ! Get them ! Hurry , this way . Around the corner . Come on . Like I said , kid . The revolution 'll find you . You 'll be okay , Jeff ? I 'll be all right . Except for a frozen tuber , I 'm fine . It isn 't a very pleasant way for a boy to spend Christmas Eve . You should be by a warm hearth with your parents . I don 't have any parents . Oh , I 'm sorry . That 's okay . To tell you the truth , I think it 's kind of exciting being here in the Revolution . Is that what you call our feeble little attempts against the Redcoats ? A revolution ? Feeble ? What about Concord ? The Battle of Bunker Hill ? Battles ? They were more like routs . We just don 't have a strong military leader . Oh , Sam and John Adams were handling things pretty well up in Boston . Until they were caught and hung . That can 't be . John Adams became our second President . President of what ? Trouble , huh ? Big trouble . Well , here they are , Admiral . The three fanatics . Looks more like two and a half . Release the boy . Admiral , he 's as guilty as the others . Imprisoning children is hardly the way to convince the colonists we deserve to rule them . Send him home to his parents . What about the other two ? Arrange a trial as quickly as possible . A trial . A fair trial , Colonel . Carry on . Yes , Admiral . That 's what happens when they put the British navy in command . What are you doing ? But the Admiral said ... After a couple of hands of cards in the tavern . Come on , Schmidt , warm your hands inside . Almost . You know , that British Admiral sure did look familiar . Washington ? He should . He 's in charge of the whole area ? Wait a second . We 're not talking about George Washington ? The best they have . We think it 's because he was born in the Colonies . He didn 't leave Virginia to join the Limey Navy until he was 14 . Well , that 's it then . We can 't do anything until we get out of these stocks though . Maybe they only made these things in adult sizes . ( EXCLAIMS ) Where is it ? On my belt . You 're going to be okay , Nathan . Over there . Is that the Colonel coming back ? Where ? I don 't see anyone . ( PLUMMETING ) ( LEAVES RUSTLING ) BOGG : Where are we , kid ? JEFFREY : Virginia . 1746 . This Mount Vernon ? I don 't know . Mom and Dad brought me here when I was seven . Sure was a lot different . Maybe this is before the big house was built . Well , all we have to do is find George Washington . Come here . Well , Mother , I guess it 's goodbye . I 'm sure you 'll find lots of new things to enjoy , places to see ... That him ? Yeah . Must be . The Father of our country . If we could stop him from joining the wrong side . Everyone says the Royal Navy 's going to be good for me . I know . It 's just that you 're so young . If you really don 't want me to go ... I mean , someone has to look after the estate . It 's what you want that counts , George . Oh , I just want what you want . It sounds like they both know what they want , but won 't admit it . MRS. WASHINGTON : Let me look at you . Listen , I have an idea . I 'll write you . I know . George ! ( COUGHS ) Your father would have been very proud of you . Goodbye , Mother . Goodbye , George . Hey , good luck . BOGG : Ahoy there , Mrs. Washington . Oh , if you 're here for George , he 's already left for the dock . Oh , yes , yes , I know . I passed him on the way . Just wanted to stop by and tell you not to worry . Oh , well , I wouldn 't say I was worried . Oh , good , good . 'Cause it 's awful easy to worry when you don 't have any idea where he is or what he 's up to . Yes . But I will . George has promised to write . ( LAUGHING ) He did , did he ? Well , that 's what they all say . But they never do . Never ? Oh , you 'll get used to it . Just keep telling yourself that the Navy 's getting better every day . Oh , why , almost half of our cabin boys missed the scurvy . Scurvy ? Oh , now that 's not counting the ones lost in battle . Boys George 's age are real curious . Keep forgetting to keep their head out of the range of cannon fire . Oh , dear ! Oh , no . I know how you feel , Mrs. Washington . But it 's not nearly as hard on the boys as some say . There 's always something to keep the boys real cheery . Like the rum ration . Did you say rum ? Oh , I 'll admit it 's not the best quality in the world , but the quantity is just right . Half a quart a day . And that 's not counting the other fringe benefits of the Navy . Females . More than a man can fight off . George is 14 years old ! But don 't let that worry you . The girls that chase the fleet around don 't mind them young . Oh , yes , ma 'am . The Navy 's gonna be the making of your son . I started of as a cabin boy myself , you know . George will probably end up just like me . ( LAUGHING ) ( SIGHS ) So , how long have you been a cabin boy ? About a year . It 's really exciting . Sometimes . But there 's lots of things they don 't tell you . Like what ? Like how much you miss your family . You miss yours ? Sometimes it really hurts . On your birthday and Christmas ... ( SIGHS ) You 're out there doing things . Even if it 's helping people . And all you want is to be home . And all you want is a hug from your mom . I 'd give anything for a hug from my mother . George ! George ! I can 't let you go , George . I 'm sorry , but I just can 't . It 's all right , Mother . I don 't want to go . What 'd you tell him ? Well , whatever it was , it sure worked . ( SIGHING ) ( DINGS ) We got a green light . Hey , you okay ? Oh , yeah . Just got something in my eye . Bogg , get me out of here . Yeah . Sure . Right away . ( PLUMMETING ) ( CARRIAGE WHEELS CLATTERING ) ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Not exactly the kind of place to cheer me up . ( BEEPING ) Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . December 24th , 1892 . Hey , Christmas Eve again . So ? So why can 't we be like normal people ? So why can 't we take a day off and have presents and stuff ? I don 't know . Well , ask the Omni . Light 's red . You mean voyagers don 't get time off for holidays ? Well , I 'm sorry . But if we didn 't do our jobs when it needs doing , there 'd be nothing for folks to celebrate . It doesn 't seem fair . No . No , I guess it isn 't . Jeff , you know if there 's any way for the Omni to get you back home ... I know , I know . But anyway , with Mom and Dad gone , home just wouldn 't be the same . Thanks . MAN : Gompers , you 're delaying . That 's all you 're doing , you 're just delaying . GOMPERS : Your families deserve more . That doesn 't sound like a holiday party . Come on . We got to stick together as a team . MAN : We got to eat . Our families got nothing . You 've got to hang in there . What are you waiting for ? You got to trust me . We can 't keep striking if we can 't afford to eat . Ten minutes . You stay on the line 10 more minutes , and I swear Jones 'll be here with the money . We don 't believe you , Gompers ! Did you hear what he called that man ? Yeah , it 's a shame . But if I can learn to live with a name like Bogg , he can adjust to one like Gompers . Samuel Gompers was the greatest labor leader America ever had . My great-grandfather knew him real well . Yeah ? Without him people would still be working 12 hours a day , seven days a week . Like voyagers . GOMPERS : It 's the only thing ... It 's the only way we 're going to get anything . Samuel ! Sam , I 'm back . It 's Jones . Jones is here with the money ! ( MEN GRUNTING ) Stay here , I 'm going after Gompers . Bogg ! ( MEN GRUNTING ) Bogg , look out ! ( MEN COUGHING ) MAN : What 's this stuff ? I can 't breathe . Bogg ! Bogg ! Bogg , where are you ? Stay out of this , kid . ( WHISTLES ) Let 's get out of here ! You okay ? Yeah . MAN : Did you get it ? Yeah . Come on . ( MEN COUGHING ) Thanks . Are you all right , Fred ? Yeah . Have you seen Sam ? I 'm right behind you . I was counting on you saving the Union . Well , you saved the Union . Oh , I didn 't do any more than these two fellas . You fellas got names ? Yeah . Phineas Bogg . This is Jeffrey Jones . Jeff . Jones , huh ? Seems we 've got the same handle . Stephen Jones . And this is Samuel Gompers . Did Jones bring the money ? Just like we promised you , boys , they can 't smoke us out , they can 't starve us out . It 's in the carriage . ( BEEPING ) It 's still red . Bogg . He said his name is Stephen Jones . Pretty common name . I 'll bet there was only one Stephen Jones that worked as a lawyer for Samuel Gompers . So ? So he 's my great-grandfather . Gone ? What do you mean gone ? I don 't understand . Those company goons must have taken it . I don 't believe that . I bet there wasn 't any money from the start . Another stall to keep our hopes up . MEN : Yeah . Are you sure ? It 's got to be him . Now , boys , relax . The company would like nothing better than for us to fight each other instead of them . Fight 's over , Sam . Fred 's right . We can 't go on striking without food . And you 'll get it . Just give us more time . More time ? We 've been striking for five months ! And all it 's gotten us is more of your broken promises . Look , if you feel that way why don 't you crawl back to the owners ? They 'll put you to work at half your old wages . It 's better than starving , huh ? Right . When that gate opens , I 'm reporting back to work . Wait ! Now think about it , boys . If you do that , you 're gonna kill the Federation . Your AFL is a wishful dream , Sam . We have to give it up before it kills us . No , you can 't mean that . Every worker in America is counting on us . It 's not just our showdown , now it 's theirs . We can 't let them down . Now tomorrow is Christmas , the plant 'll be closed . Give me that one day to go back to the other unions and ask them to pass the hat for us one more time . Another stall . But it 's worth a try . Look , just give Sam a chance to raise more money . I agree . Who are you ? The guy who pulled you out of that fight back there , that 's who . Look , you 've been on strike for five months . What 's one more day ? Consider it Christmas present for Mr. Gompers here . ( ALL MUTTERING ) Okay , Sam , you got 24 hours , but that 's all . All right . STEPHEN : Let me tell Amy we 've got guests . Make yourselves at home . I 'll also try to find you some warmer clothes . That 'd be great . ( DOOR CLOSING ) ( CLOCK TICKING ) Bogg ! What ? I used to be rocked to sleep in this . Are you sure ? Well , it had a lot more scratches and dents in it . This is the one . Dad would rock me fast , Ma would rock me ... slow . ( SIGHING ) I never thought I 'd see it again . ( EXCLAIMING ) Bogg , look at this ! We used to have this on our Christmas tree . You 're good at family history , you know . It 's easy . Look at this . It 's just like my own home . AMY : Oh , Stephen , no ! That is just not fair . STEPHEN : Amy , please . You don 't want our guests to hear you . I don 't care who hears . You 've given your life to that Union . And now they accuse you of lying about that money . That is not fair ! The men are scared and they 're hungry . They didn 't mean it . They turn on you and still you take their side . How much more can you give them ? I can give them one more day . And then will you start taking legal clients who can pay you ? I can 't let the men down . Oh , Amy , don 't you see , there 'll be plenty of time for making money after we save the Union . The Union ! I don 't care about the Union ! But , Amy , the Union ... I care about you . And I care about our baby . I 'd rather see the Union die than to watch it destroy you . Don 't you understand ? I love you . You ... Stubborn goat . A stubborn goat , am I ? You should 've heard what I wanted to call you . ( STEPHEN SIGHING ) I know what I put you through . But I 'll make it up to you . Okay . Make it up to me . You 've got five seconds . Five seconds . Well , what can I do in five seconds ? I know . What are they doing ? Being a family . This is great soup , Ms. Jones . If you like potato peels and water . Would you like some more ? No , thanks . We 're not really that hungry . Well , you two are the only ones in Pittsburg who can say that , besides the mill owners . Is there something wrong with your plate , Jeff ? You keep staring at it . It 's great ! My mom used to have some just like these . Used to ? Jeff 's folks are gone . I 'm sorry , son . What are you two doing for Christmas ? Would you like to spend it with us ? Are you kidding ? Oh , that 's awfully nice of you to ask , but could Jeff and I talk about it ? If you 're worried about imposing , don 't be . No . We 'd really like you to stay . Could we , Bogg ? ( KNOCK ON DOOR ) Hold on a second . I 'll get it . Sam ! Come on in . Sorry to spoil your dinner , everybody . Oh , that 's okay . GOMPERS : Mrs. Jones . Bad news . The council turned you down ? Even worse . They 're holding you and me responsible for the stolen money . I 'm afraid it 's over . The strike , this Union . We 've lost everything . There must be some other place we could go for money . GOMPERS : I 've tried every place . I know somebody that has the exact amount you 're looking for . Who ? The people who stole it . The strikebreakers ? That 's right . It 's your money . Maybe I can get it back . Impossible . It 's worth a try . Do you know where they keep it ? Well , there 's a large safe in the company payroll office . That 's the most logical place . Okay , that 's where I 'll look . How will I know it ? It was in a black satchel in $ 20 gold pieces . Right . But ... Phineas , you don 't stand a chance . It must be guarded by a small army of company police . I always prefer a small one to a large army . Come on , Jeff . Hey , you know you never gave them an answer about Christmas . That 's because I don 't know what answer to give them . Oh , please , Bogg , they 're my family . But we 're supposed to be helping , right ? ( OMNI BEEPING ) Yeah . Right . ( HARKER LAUGHING ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) ( WHISPERS ) It 's locked . Let 's try a window . Good idea . Except , they 're all up there . No problem . We got a problem . Look , why don 't ... Give me a boost . Good thinking . All clear . ( MEN LAUGHING ) ( BARKING ) I thought you said it was clear . ( DOG SNARLING ) There 's nothing to be afraid of . I think he 's glad to see us . That 's because he thinks we 're lunch . Lunch . Wait a minute , I got a better idea . ( WHINES ) Come on , boy . Go get it . You know , he 's gonna be really mad when he finds out you tricked him . What 's he gonna do about it ? Slip under the door ? Come on . You know , I think you got something against dogs . I don 't have anything against dogs . What I have is teeth marks . Millenniums of teeth marks . Bogg , look . It 's locked . No problem . This one 's locked , too . Too bad . But I think I can lick it . ( DOG BARKING ) You hear something ? ( SIGHS ) This one 's really tough . Maybe too tough . Check those desks over there . Maybe the combination 's written down somewhere . ( DOG BARKING ) Hey , there 's somebody up there . Charlie ! Mike ! Over here ! Open it . ( BOGG MUMBLING ) ( SIGHING ) I don 't think I can open this one . You don 't have to . Look what I 've found . I guess the guys that stole it didn 't know how to open the safe either . ( DOG BARKING ) Follow him . About time we had some good luck . Come on . ( GROWLING ) Hold it right there . I told you he was gonna be mad . You put that satchel down real easy . Or by the time he gets through with you , you 'll look like beef jerky . ( DOG SNARLING ) Sic them , boy . Sic them . Do something , Bogg . Maybe beef jerky isn 't such a bad idea . Okay , dog , you win . Here , boy , dessert . ( MEN GROANING ) Grab the satchel . ( BEEPING ) All right . ( PLUMMETING ) ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Where are we ? Hold on a sec , I 'll check . Don 't bother . We 're back in Colonies . ( BEEPING ) Yeah . It 's 1776 again . How 'd you know ? Over there . Remember him ? Carry on , Major . Thank you , General Washington . George Washington . And he 's on the right side . Yeah . So what are we doing back here ? We fixed his life . ( BEEPING ) If we fixed it , why 's the Omni red ? He maybe the father of your country but George there needs a lot of babysitting . Well , I think I 'll get a little rest while I can . Hey , duck . What are we ducking for ? That Major , he walks sneaky . ( WHISPERS ) Sarah . I 'm here , darling . I 've missed you so . And I 've missed you . But soon it will all be over , I promise . Here . What 's this ? Washington is launching an attack across the Delaware tonight . On Christmas ? What better time for a surprise ? This is his battle plan . Deliver this note to Colonel Rall . The Hessians can capture Washington 's entire army and put an end to this whole , stupid rebellion . And then we 'll live in London , like you promised ? Even better than I promised . Oh , David ! We got to get that note back . Somehow we 've got to beat her back to Rall . Isn 't he the guy that put us in those stocks ? Sure is . Then we 've got more than one reason for wanting to see him again . Come on . There she is ! Let 's go . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) Two crowns . ( COINS RATTLING ) Put this over . Merry Christmas , Colonel . From all your loyal friends . We 're too late ? No , we aren 't . That 's my game they 're playing . Snibbitz . Bogg , how many times do I have to tell you ? It 's called poker . Lucky we brought these table stakes . That 's the Union 's money . Trust me . Bogg , come back ! Can anyone get in this game ? Anybody with money . ( COINS RATTLING ) Mind if I deal ? ( MAN COUGHING ) Four aces . ( PEOPLE MURMURING ) Guess that means I win again . Means you won everything . Game 's over . Oh , too bad . It was just getting to be fun . Fun for you maybe . Shall we go ? Tell you what . Why don 't we keep playing , I 'll bet money against whatever you like ? That 's decent of you . Like what ? I don 't know . How about that coat you 're wearing , Colonel ? My coat ? Why not ? It 's a real pretty red . What if I told you this coat is worth four of those gold coins ? I 'd say that 's fair . Then give me the cards and I 'll deal . SOLDIER 1 : ( LAUGHING ) Look at Rall . SOLDIER 2 : ( LAUGHING ) Looks like it got him over his head this time . ( COINS JINGLING ) General Washington will be glad to see this . And you also made a pretty good profit for the Union . Yeah . We 're in pretty good shape . Let 's report back to General Washington . Seize that man ! He 's a card cheat for certain , and probably a rebel spy . Stay where you are , man . There 's no escape . Bogg , I don 't think there 's a back door . Stick with me . Come on , Bogg . Come on , this way . Bogg , wait ! We already tried this way . Remember ? Oh , right . ( CAROLERS SINGING ) Get that thing out of there ! Get it out ! Come on , keep it moving ! Search the streets ! I want those two ! Move it . Quiet ! I said quiet ! That 's better . Sorry , sir . We were just trying to spread some Christmas cheer . I 'm trying to find two rebel spies , a man and a boy . They come through here ? I didn 't see anyone go through here . You didn 't , did you ? All right . Get out of here . Thank you , sir , and Merry Christmas . ( GRUNTS ) ( SINGING ) Deck the halls with boughs of holly Fa la la la la , la la la la 'Tis the season to be jolly Fa la la la la , la la la la You 're sure the British never read my plan ? They never had a chance . General Washington , I guarantee your attack will be a surprise and a success . I hope so . We could use a success right now . Morale is low . We have suffered too many defeats . Thank you for your help . I wish I could express it more fully , but it 's time to go . Can we see you off ? Of course . You know , I hate boats . I 'm just lucky I never joined the Navy . I get seasick . Mind a bit of advice ? Good advice I never mind , bad advice I tolerate . Stand in the bow . You get the wind in your face . Makes your stomach think it 's on dry land . I 'll try it . Okay . SOLDIER : Hurry up . Get the boat over here , and the oars . Thanks again . And Merry Christmas , boys . Merry Christmas , General Washington . Merry Christmas . Can you believe it ? George Washington himself wished us a Merry Christmas . Glad you liked it . ( DINGS ) Omni liked it , too . Green light . Now can we go back and help my great-grandparents ? I have a feeling they 're gonna be real glad to see us and this . Yeah . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) Say hello to your husband , Mrs. Goodfell . Merry Christmas . Merry Christmas and God bless you . AMY : Merry Christmas . Merry Christmas , Ben . Thanks , Sam . I want to apologize for ever having doubted you . You , too , Stephen . Forget it , Ben . Just stay with us until we win the strike . I 'll stay . I always wanted to . Couldn 't do it with hungry kids . Ben 's right . We can all hold out now . As long as it takes ? Even longer than that . Sam , you got yourself a Union . Oh , it 's not mine . It 's yours . There you are ! Could you two stop working for just a minute ? Why ? Well , Stephen wants Mr. Gompers to tell the men that it was really you two who got the money back . Oh , I 'd rather you didn 't do that . Why not ? The men are going to need Sam Gompers and Stephen Jones to look up to long after we 're gone . Stephen isn 't gonna like that . I really think it 's best . You 're just as stubborn as he is , aren 't you ? Well , I 'm more stubborn . And I insist that you two can 't leave until you 've had Christmas dinner with Stephen and me . Wouldn 't have it any other way . Okay . We 'll see you home at 7 : 00 then . Okay ? How does it look ? Perfect . ( SIGHS ) I don 't know . Perfectly strange I think , you mean . Oh , let 's face it , Jeffrey . I 'm just not very handy . You know I always flunked in sewing class ? By my own mother . I think it 's a terrific angel . Oh , well . Next year we 'll get a real one and we 'll throw this joke away . No , no , no . Please . Don 't do that . Why not ? Well , I like this one . And I bet your baby will . And your other kids will . And your grandkids . It 's so klutzy-Iooking , it ... It just makes you feel good . Okay . Angel , you 've got a job . Isn 't she great ? Spunky lady . And Stephen . He 's a lot like my dad . Then I 'd say your dad was a good man . The best . Dad was named after him , you know . No , I didn 't know . I need two volunteers . Well , for what ? Well , it 's sort of a self-discipline test . You see if you can manage to string up any of this popcorn as Christmas ornaments before you eat it all up . Oh , I 'll volunteer . How about you , Phineas ? Come on , Bogg . Sure . Okay . No , Amy . You leave Phineas alone . I want to talk with him . You want us to wait for you ? No , no . Go ahead . Come on , leave them to their man-talk . Besides , it just leaves more for you and me to eat . Yeah . Here . Why don 't you sit there and I 'll give you a needle and thread . In the rocker ? Yes , in the rocker . Here you go . Go on , sit down . We 're very grateful to you , Phineas . And I 've been trying to think of a way to repay you . Forget it . No . None of us can forget what you 've done . And we want to return the favor . And I think I know how . I think we can help you with Jeffrey . What do you mean ? Well , to begin with , he must be a great responsibility for you . Oh , no . He 's no trouble at all . In fact , I kind of like having him around . I can see how you 'd feel that way . He 's a wonderful boy . But you do have to consider his side of it . It 's not right for a young boy to miss school . Now , he 's very smart . Oh , I know . It 's just with all the travel around we do ... That 's where I think we can help you . Amy and I would like Jeffrey to live with us . Live here ? All the time ? Yes . Now , we don 't have much , but it 's a home . And he needs that . You think so , huh ? Oh , you 've seen how starved he is to be part of a real family . It 's not easy for a boy that young to lose his parents . Now , Phineas , I wouldn 't even bring it up if I didn 't know that you want the best for Jeffrey .

We were singing Christmas carols , and all of a sudden you were just gone . Where 's your coat ? You 're gonna catch a cold . Bogg , what 's going on ? Where are you going ? I 'm leaving . Leaving ? Without me ? Yeah . Without you . But why ? Your great-grandfather can say it a million times better than I can . Say what ? That they can take care of you better than I can . There 's nothing wrong with the way you take care of me . Being a voyager is no life for a kid . Greek food one day , Chinese food the next . No holidays ... Did you ever hear me complaining ? Yeah . A lot . Now go back there and get warm and happy . Bogg , stop it ! What do you think you 're doing ? What I should 've done a long time ago . Giving you a home with a mother and father who love you . But I don 't want them . I want you . You can have a family . But I 've already got a family ! Don 't you understand ? It 's you . ( SOBBING ) JEFFREY ... If you wanna learn about George Washington and the American Revolution , or Samuel Gompers and the American Labor Movement , take a voyage down to your public library . It 's all in books ! ( INDIANS SHOUTING ) Buffalo Bill , you are truly the king of showmen . This Wild West Show is a fake . Who are you ? The name 's Oakley , but you can call me Annie . Let me go ! ( WOMAN SCREAMS ) We must get that boy . BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! JEFFREY : These landings start to get to you after a while . BOGG : Hard landings are an occupational hazard . We had a saying in voyager school , " It 's not where you land , but how you land that counts . " SOLDIER : Take cover ! You 're going to get yourselves killed ! Is that guy talking to us ? Hurry ! They 're ... It 's a tank , kid . You 're Americans ? Sort of . What 's the year ? SOLDIER : Well , you nearly got yourselves killed out there . ( BEEPING ) 1917 . You 're British ? Yes , but very far away from home . I 'm afraid I shall never see England again . I wouldn 't be too sure about that . The English are gonna win this war against Germany . Yeah , well , not with half our bloody army fighting a revolution here in Russia . This is Russia ? ( BEEPING ) Yeah , 1917 . And we got a red light . This is all messed up . You don 't have to tell me that . We 're outnumbered on all fronts and winter 's closing in . The supply lines are cut off so I can 't offer you any food to eat . I haven 't had anything to eat for three days . I got some beef jerky here . It 's not much but it might hold you until your supplies get here . Oh . ( EXPLOSION ) Is England supposed to be fighting in the Russian Revolution ? I think England sent some troops to Russia , but not till 1918 . Not until the war was over . If we wait , the revolutionaries would surely depose the czar . It would be bad enough if it were only Alexandra 's life at stake . Who 's she ? That 's the Czar Nicholas wife and Queen Victoria 's granddaughter . If only Queen Victoria hadn 't allowed her other granddaughter to marry that Russian . What Russian ? Well , the Queen betrothed Princess Victoria to Duke Michael of Russia . And he 's the one who got England involved in the Russian Revolution ? That 's right . And with the lives of two English princesses at stake , we 're only bound to fight . ( GRUNTS ) We got to stop those marriages . No , just one of them . Alexandra 's supposed to marry Czar Nicholas . Then it 's Princess Victoria and her duke who won 't be hearing wedding bells . SOLDIER : Blimey ! ( EXCLAIMING ) ( PLUMMETING ) BOGG : You okay ? Yeah . ( INDIANS SHOUTING ) But Omni 's not . We 're back in America . It must be the 1850s . ( BEEPING ) Uh-uh . BOGG : 1887 . You sure ? Yeah , I 'm sure . Well , it 's definitely the Wild West . ( INDIANS SHOUTING ) ( BEEPING ) England . No way . Well , look for yourself . England , 1887 , and we got a red light . Bogg , it 's a runaway . BOGG : Stay put , kid . ( INDIANS SHOUTING ) Help ! Help me . Grab on , sonny . CONSTANTINE : Daring woman . DUKE : Don 't be ridiculous , Constantine . It 's all a fake . Whoa , whoa , easy . Thanks , what is all this ? And who are you ? The name 's Oakley , but you can call me Annie . Get off of my stage ! You okay ? Yeah , thanks to Annie Oakley . BOGG : Hey , kid , I don 't think they had castles in the Wild West . And I don 't think they had cowboys and Indians in England either . What 's going on here , Bill ? He ruined everything . Some recovery , huh ? Buffalo Bill ? Sure . Buffalo Bill Hickok . Pleasure to meet you . The name 's Cody . Buffalo Bill Cody . Cody ? He 's thinking of Wild Bill Hickok . Yeah . Wild Bill , Buffalo Bill , natural mistake . Buffalo Bill Cody rode for the Pony Express and was an Army scout . That 's right , son , and helped settle the entire American Frontier . But he can 't manage his own Wild West Show . Next time there 's a change in the act , let me know . I didn 't change anything . I don 't know who they are . They just dropped out of nowhere . QUEEN : Will someone please let us out of this carriage ? Oh , no , the Queen . BOGG : They didn 't have queens in the Wild West , did they ? No , but Buffalo Bill 's Wild West show did tour all over Europe . And if this is England , 1887 ... Here , let me help you down . Watch your step , Your Highness . Oh , it was wonderful . Simply wonderful . That 's Queen Victoria . BOGG : Now , all we have to do is find the princess . Princess Victoria , let me help you . BOGG : Bingo . Mr. Cody , my granddaughter and I enjoyed ourselves immensely , didn 't we , Victoria ? Oh , yes , it was all very exciting . Now please introduce us to those wonderful performers of yours . Weren 't they wonderful , Your Majesty ? ( WHISPERING ) Give me names . Phineas Bogg , Jeffrey Jones . Bogg and Jones . My two latest discoveries . Brought here at great expense from the prairies of the great American West . Especially for the Queen 's golden jubilee . Buffalo Bill , you are truly the king of showmen . DUKE : Buffalo Bill is a fraud . Mr. Cody and his accomplices make a mockery of the Queen 's Jubilee . Why , Duke Michael , how do they mock our Jubilee ? That 's the Russian duke , we have to stop him from marrying the princess . That 's trouble . Bet on it . This Wild West Show is a fake . Our show is 100 ° % authentic . It 's a tribute to the brave men and women who risked their lives to tame the American West . DUKE : And I suppose this arrow is authentic . It 's a re-enactment of those courageous men 's deeds . No one can deny the courage in which these deeds were portrayed . Yes , Duke . Why his performances were full of dangerous feats . And it was thrilling when Mr. Bogg jumped on the carriage and brought it to a stop . Your Mr. Bogg is nothing more than a prop . Here is the man who steered your coach to safety . I believe it 's called a hidden driver . Look , mister , jumping onto a moving wagon is dangerous . That 's right . In fact , Annie 's supposed to do it in the show and it 's a difficult stunt . Too difficult for a woman , it seems . Nothing 's too tough for Annie . She can ride as good as any man I 've ever met . And nobody can touch her shooting . If Miss Oakley is such a good shot , perhaps she would like to engage in a shooting match ? Testing your skills against mine ? At targets , of course . You got it . Tomorrow , at 12 : 00 . I 'll be there . Oh , this is delightful . Now , we 'll have another exhibition , and then I shall announce my granddaughter 's betrothal to the Duke . It will be a grand day , won 't it , dear ? ( CHURCH BELLS RINGING ) Yes , Grandmother . JEFFREY : Not if we can help it . And , oh , yes , it 's time for tea . Mr. Cody , you and your magnificent troupe will join us . Your Majesty , we would be honored . I think that would be a lapse of decorum . Good . Lately , I 've been up to my corset in decorum . Wow , you clobbered him . Sorry , Duke . DUKE : It 's perfectly all right . I 'll get my revenge tomorrow . What are these ? Crumpets . Do you like them ? Yeah . You make them yourself ? No . I never learned how to cook . For the last 50 years , I 've been busy ruling the empire . Yeah , I guess working women like us got to give up something . Imagine me , sipping tea with the Queen and a gentleman like the Duke . Yes , well , it 's an experience I 'm sure they won 't soon forget either . Mr. Cody , may I trust you with a confidence ? Why , sure . The Duke must win that match tomorrow . Well , nobody likes to lose . If the Duke loses , so does Russia . Now , how do you figure that ? Mr. Cody , the Duke must appear manly , noble , an appropriate Russian consort for the English Princess . As a man of the world , surely you can understand the damage to the Duke 's reputation if he were to be beaten by a young girl like Miss Oakley . Annie 's a very good shot . She even beat me , once or twice . ( EXCLAIMS ) But the fates of nations do not rest on your victory . International alliances are not destroyed by your defeat . Yeah . Well , I 'll be rooting for the Duke all the way . I 'm afraid that won 't be enough . We would like you to make sure Miss Oakley loses the match . But I must marry the Duke . You can 't just rush into a thing like marriage . This union has been arranged for quite some time . But you could do a lot better than him . Yes , Mr. Bogg . There are other men I might prefer . Oh , what does it matter who I marry ? It 's only my unhappiness at stake . It matters , all right . You 'd be surprised how many other peoples ' happiness depends on the man you choose . Would it really matter to you who I marry ? Sure , I would . I mean , I want you to marry the right man . I mean ... Oh , Phineas , what a wonderful day . And riding in that stage today , oh , it was quite a thrill . But tomorrow , my life continues in its tidy little course . When the Queen announces my betrothal to the Duke . Do you love him ? No , but love 's not the reason I 'm marrying the Duke . Well , why then ? Grandmother feels that alliance with Russia will strengthen England . And my marriage to the Duke will make that alliance . Well , can 't you just say no ? A woman ought to have the right to choose her own husband . A princess has many privileges , but few freedoms . As hard as I may wish it , I 'm not like Annie . I 'm not an ordinary woman . BOGG : Well , one thing is for sure , the Princess does not want to marry him . JEFFREY : She may not have to . The aide said the betrothal might not come off unless the Duke wins the match . That 's not much to hang our hats on . Right . Buffalo Bill did ask Annie to throw it . Yeah ? Yeah . Something about the Duke being humiliated in front of the Queen if Annie wins . What 's so humiliating about losing to Annie ? Everybody knows what a good shot she is . In 1887 , women weren 't supposed to beat men at anything . So Annie beats the Duke , and the Queen gives back the Princess ' hand . Unless Buffalo Bill talks her out of winning . That 's all we got . So we better make sure Annie 's ready for that match . BILL : Look , missy , I 'm not asking you again ! ANNIE : Good , ' cause I 'm not gonna lose on purpose , no matter how many times you ask me ! You 'll do what I say . And after I lose , I suppose you want me to act like that silly little Princess and swoon into the Duke 's arms ? Well , I won 't do it . You 'll do what 's good for this show . Buffalo Bill , right now I 'm ashamed to even be part of your rotten show ! Think she 'll give in ? Not if we can talk her into hanging tough . So he says . The Duke 's got his pride and reputation to worry about . Well , what about my pride ? What about my reputation ? I 'll bet I 've worked harder being a sharpshooter than he ever worked at being a duke . All he had to do was get born . He thinks he 's always supposed to win just because he 's a duke . And Bill thinks he ought to win just because he 's a man . It 's not fair . You bet it isn 't . But when you 're a woman living in a man 's world , you learn real fast that fair 's got nothing to do with it . You learn you got to be twice as good as a man just to be considered equal . You learn never to make a mistake , never to lose your temper , never to let down your guard . Because somehow that one moment of just being human is gonna be used against you as a woman . ( SIGHS ) No , it 's been too hard a climb up to buckle under for some lousy duke now . Gentlemen , if you will excuse us . We 'd like a word alone with Miss Oakley . Whatever you 've got to say , you say it in front of them . Please , Mr. Bogg . You heard the lady , we 're not going . Let me go ! ( ANNIE SCREAMING ) ( MUFFLED SCREAMS ) Bogg . We must get that boy . Bogg , wake up . Where 's the Omni ? Bogg , wake up . The gun powder 's gonna go . ( SPEAKING RUSSIAN ) Got it . Please , Omni , get us out of here . ( PLUMMETING ) ( GRUNTS ) Bogg ? Are you okay ? Yeah . We got to go back and help Annie . We got a red light here . ( BEEPING ) Africa , 40 miles south of the equator , 1913 ? Those Russian guys were sure big and gnarly . You ain 't seen nothing yet . Looks like we jumped out of the frying pan right into the fire . ( DRUMS BEATING ) Chief Nogonde is no better . The worm burrows here . The white missionary has failed . His medicine has failed ! He cannot cure , he cannot heal ! Massandi speaks the truth . Your Chief Nogonde is very sick . But there is still hope he can be saved . All your magic has done nothing . A witch doctor cannot cure without his charms . I cannot help your chief until my medicines arrive . We have waited and Chief Nogonde grows weaker . My men will be here . You will stay until they do . Dr. Schweitzer , as Chief Nogonde lives or dies , so shall you . Uh-oh . You know what 's wrong ? Are these your men ? SCHWEITZER : No . But their skin is white . Is every man with black skin part of your tribe ? You are not his friends ? No , but we 're not his enemies either . In fact , we 're nobody 's enemies . What are you doing here ? If you know anything , now 's the time to speak up . Dr. Schweitzer ? Yes . Did the hospital send the medicine with you ? No . If they are not from the hospital , they must be slavers from the timber camp . We 're not slavers ! Keep them apart from our people . Their poison has spread far enough amongst us . Do not take your eyes off the white man until I return . JEFFREY : We 're not going anywhere . BOGG : You got it . Who are you two ? You 're really not slavers ? No way ! These guys aren 't real friendly , are they ? They have good reason to be wary . White men from the timber company have been terrorizing the villages . No offense , Doc , but you 're not the most popular guy around here either . Bogg , this is Dr. Schweitzer . Schweitzer , right . Albert Schweitzer . Winner of the Nobel Prize for Peace . He dedicated his whole life to helping the people of Africa . You must have the wrong person . I 've only been here a short while , hardly long enough to help anyone . Now it seems I may not get the chance . Don 't worry , Doc , we 'll get you out of here . No ! What , you don 't want to be rescued ? No , I don 't want to seem ungrateful but I must stay . Why ? Because , if I am to help these people with medicine , I must have the confidence of all the tribes . If Nogonde , their leader , dies , the drums will spread the word all up and down the Ogowe River that medicine has no power . Then all these people will be left with is the witch doctor and his charms . But your medicine does work . Of course . Nogonde has amoebic dysentery . I could cure him with emetine if I had the drug here . But our canoe was capsized by hippopotamus on the way up river . I lost all the supplies I had on hand . Is there a hospital nearby ? I sent one of my men back to the hospital in Lambaréné for more of the drug , but he hasn 't returned yet . Then maybe he 's lost . Yeah , there 's lots of wild animals out there . No , Joseph was born here . He taught me all I know about the jungle . He will come back with the medicine . If he doesn 't and the Chief dies , you 're gonna be in big trouble . I have faith in Joseph and in God . Maybe I can give him a little help . Joseph , I mean . What are you going to do ? Find Joseph . Bogg , that 's a big jungle out there . Do you know what trail he would have taken ? I think so . Can you give me a map ? Yes . But even if you did escape , these warriors are excellent trackers . Well , somebody 's got to try it . Forget it , Bogg . Look at these guys . You 'd never even get out of the village . They never take their eyes off us . Unless , we could give them something else to look at . Like what ? Like magic . They don 't call me The Amazing Jeffrey for nothing . Do you want to see it again ? Yeah , do it again . Watch . Very impressive . Not bad . You learned that in a school play ? Got lots of them . Are they watching yet ? They 're beginning to get interested . How do you do it ? A magician never reveals his secrets . BOGG : I think they 're beginning to bite . All right , show us another one . One by the fire . Now , watch my hand . JEFFREY : Are they watching ? SCHWEITZER : Yes , keep going . Is Bogg gone yet ? He 's going , but let 's give him some more time . Do it again . Okay . Watch very closely . Open your hand . Open your hand . Your magic is as false as your medicine . The other one , he 's gone ! We 've got to get him back before he gets to the other slavers . After him . After him ! He 'll be back , he 'll bring the medicine to save your chief . He will bring more white men with guns . No . Why should we believe you after you 've tricked us ? The white man has betrayed us again . Take them ! No , don 't hurt the boy . He is no threat to you . Remember , Dr. Schweitzer , your life now hangs by the same thread as Chief Nogonde . ( HISSING ) BOGG : Sorry , I can 't hang on . Do you think Bogg has a chance out there ? I hope so , for Nogonde 's sake . He 's a good , strong leader . Maybe he can talk to Massandi , make him understand . Unfortunately , Massandi is right , in his own way . For every illness I can cure , contact with the white man brings a new disease . The timber industry has caused terrible famine , terrible . We do have much to answer for . We can 't just sit here . Isn 't there some other kind of treatment you can try ? I 'm afraid not . We got to do something . Yes . We must do the hardest thing a young man has ever been asked to do . Wait . ( DRUMS BEATING ) RAPP : Hear those drums ? Somebody 's in big trouble . You stay low , while I check the waterhole . We might be able to pick up another half a dozen volunteers before we head back . Hurry up . I 'll keep an eye on this bunch . Sit down , boy . I told you my name is Joseph . I said sit ! Now , that 's much better . You know , can 't figure it . What tribe dresses its warriors like that ? I am not a warrior . I work for Dr. Schweitzer , and I need to ... You need to get some medicine to him . I know , you told me . And that 's all I want to hear about it . You 're not Schweitzer 's boy , anymore . You 're a timber worker now . You 're gonna get up early and work hard for your food , like the rest of your friends . You know , I don 't see how he can work for Schweitzer and you at the same time . What the ... Back off ! What are you doing ? You 're one of us . I may be white , but I 'm definitely not one of you . You got the medicine ? Yes , but the drums say the doctor will die with the chief . Nobody 's gonna die if we get it there on time . Untie them . ( WHIPS ) Untie them ! Okay , okay . ( DRUMS BEATING ) There they go again . What are they saying ? They 're saying that Chief Nogonde is very near death . And the white doctor is going to share his fate . We could have had an equal share . You know , the kind of money you just let get away . Yeah , the kind that makes your hands dirty . Come on , we got to get that medicine back to the village . He came up at me from behind . Hegson , where are the others ? He let them go . Well , then he 'll just have to help us find them again . Won 't you ? Does it have to be the four I freed or would any four do ? As long as they 're strong and healthy , any four 'll do . ( LAUGHS ) Good . Well , how about the four right behind you ? How stupid do you think I am ? You 're pretty stupid , if you don 't drop that rifle . What 's wrong with you ? I always wanted to do that . They don 't appreciate all the sacrifices you 're making for them . You could be back in your own house right now . Instead of sitting here and waiting if you 're going to live or die . Sacrifice , huh ? I do miss Germany . But Africa has become my heart 's home . For it is here I have learnt the true meaning of , " Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben . " What does that mean ? Reverence for life . You mean like , not killing unless you have to ? The idea loses much in the translation . No , it means having respect for life , all life . No matter how small or how different that life might be from our own . It demands each of us give up a small part of our lives for others . Do you understand ? Huh ? Yeah . I think so . ( SIGHS ) Chief Nogonde has dropped into the dreamless sleep . He 's dead ? No , it means he 's in a coma and quite close to death . Dr. Schweitzer , you must die now . Why ? The spirits demand a soul . Perhaps they will be content with a soul other than Chief Nogonde 's . That 's not fair ! You 're just a lousy witch doctor . You don 't know anything about respect for life . BOGG : Dr. Schweitzer , Jeff , we got the medicine . Bogg ! Doctor , are we in time ? You may try . What about the boy and Mr. Bogg ? Release all the white men . But beware , it will be unwise to test my mercy a second time . I hope the Chief lives . ( DINGS ) He does . Green light . Green light . ( SIGHS ) Well , you saved the Chief and Dr. Schweitzer . Yeah , he 's quite a guy . Yeah . He told me all about this idea of his , reverence for life . Oh , yeah ? Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben ? Yeah . Come on , we got to rescue Annie from those Russian bears . But we don 't even know where they took her . They haven 't had time to take her to Russia , so I figure they got her someplace right here in England . Bogg , England 's a big place . Yeah , so we better start searching . As soon as I rustle up a couple of horses , we 're on our way . Go on , quit the show ! She didn 't quit , Buffalo Bill . I 'm afraid she did , son . Quit and tried to burn the whole Wild West Show down besides . You know , it wasn 't very nice of you to ask her to lose , just so that Duke and his friends would keep coming back to your show . Son , you 've got to understand something . My Wild West Show has made me a very rich man . Kings and Queens ask me to tea . The most beautiful women in Europe let me kiss their hand . When I was scouting Indians for the Army , well , I was so poor and dusty , no woman would come near me . Even the officers . Didn 't think I was good enough to eat in their tent . I don 't ever want to have to live that way again . Well , now you 're rich and famous . You 've got everything you ever wanted . Yeah . But I did lose one thing somewhere along the way . What 's that ? My honor and the respect for other peoples ' honor . None of this would have happened if I had the guts to tell the Russians no in the first place . Annie didn 't start that fire . It was started accidentally when the Duke 's aide and his guys kidnapped her . They kidnapped Annie ? But I told the Russians they could talk to her . Why those dirty ... We 've got to get Annie back ! Come on ! What are you doing with Benedict Arnold ? Buffalo Bill 's gonna help us rescue Annie . Please , Mr. Bogg , let me go with you . To redeem my honor . Never mind , we 've got to hurry . It 's almost 12 : 00 , and we don 't even know where to start looking . BILL : Yes , we do . You know where they took Annie ? I got a pretty good hunch . Where ? The Duke and his pals are staying at a big spread outside of town . That royal skunk invited me to dinner last night so he can console me about losing Annie . Come on ! Whoa , kid , you 're not coming with us . Why ? 'Cause you 're gonna be at the castle . Try and stall the match till we get there . How am I supposed to do that ? ( SIGHS ) Don 't worry , you 'll think of something . ANNIE : You can dress up and talk fancy , but you 're nothing but a lousy outlaw . It 's bad enough you taking me , but leaving that little boy and Mr. Bogg to get blown up like that ... In fact , I 'm not gonna sit still for this another second . BILL : The barn 's just up ahead . That 's the Duke 's carriage . Quick , behind the trees . The Duke awaits me . I must be on my way to the castle . Don 't look now . In back of me up the road , there are two men on horseback . They must not reach Miss Oakley . Dispose of them as you would any enemy of mother Russia . ANNIE : What ? I won 't eat it . Torturing folks , trying to make me eat raw fish eggs . ( SPUTTERS ) Well , it won 't work with me . I 'm not gonna lose that match no matter what awful stuff you try and feed me . Impressed , ain 't you ? DUKE : My opponent still has not arrived . Buffalo Bill and Miss Oakley still have a few minutes before the match begins . He 'll be here . I mean , Buffalo Bill wouldn 't dare ignore a royal request . You can 't fool me , my little Princess . You 're just hoping Mr. Cody will bring back your friend . Well , he was very brave and dashing . And handsome . Broad shouldered , strong , lean of limb . Grandmother ! I 'm old darling , not dead . Your Majesty , it 's nearly 12 : 00 and Miss Oakley is quite obviously not coming . Nearly 12 : 00 is correct . What makes you so sure Miss Oakley will not be here ? Well , I 'm only anxious to proceed with the rest of the afternoon 's agenda . The sooner you declare this match forfeit , the sooner we might get on to other happier affairs . I mean , after all , Your Majesty , the rules dictate . Duke Michael , I dictate the rules . We will wait a few more minutes . ( SCREAMS ) ( GROANING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( MEN SPEAKING RUSSIAN ) The horses are outside . You get to the castle . BOGG : Go , Annie . Go back to the castle . Hurry up , go ! Go on . Let 's go . Get going , I 'm right behind you . I got to see the Queen , it 's an emergency . Please , you got to let me in , it 's real important . You see , Annie Oakley doesn 't have the courage to face me in this match . JEFFREY : She 'll be here ! Jeffrey ? Please , Your Majesty . Let the boy go . Is Miss Oakley with you ? No , but she 's on her way right now . What detained her ? Maybe you should ask the Duke and his friend . This boy is insolent . They kidnapped her . Why would the Duke do such a thing ? The boy is obviously lying . I 'm not lying . Then perhaps this is a story that you made up . No , please , Your Majesty , you have to believe me . I must believe the Duke . JEFFREY : Why ? A boy who tells a story can be forgiven , a man who kidnaps a woman , cannot be forgiven . Your Majesty , it is now 12 : 00 . And since the Duke has no opponent , the Queen has no choice but to declare a forfeit . Jeffrey , I must respect the rules of the match . It was to begin at 12 : 00 sharp . ( CHURCH BELLS TOLLING ) Okay , then let it begin . Let the Duke take his turn first . DUKE 'S AIDE : This is ridiculous . We should simply proceed with the betrothal . I think Jeffrey 's idea is splendid , Grandmother . Duke Michael , please , take your turn . And if , when you are done , Miss Oakley still has not arrived , then I shall be most happy to declare the forfeit . ( COCKING ) ( PEOPLE APPLAUDING ) I 'm afraid Miss Oakley is not going to get here in time . Please , Your Majesty , if you 'll just wait a few more minutes , I know she 'll be here . But we have to get on with the betrothal . I 'm very sorry , my darling , I can 't put it off any longer . ( PEOPLE APPLAUDING ) But I don 't love him , Grandmother . Close your eyes and think of England . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) DUKE 'S AIDE : Just take your time . ( PEOPLE APPLAUDING ) Your Majesty . Yes , yes . We must get on with it . Due to Miss Oakley 's failure to appear , I declare this match ... ( ANNIE SCREAMS ) You did it . BOGG : No , I didn 't , kid . Annie Oakley did . Your Majesty , the match is over . It 's time for you to announce the Princess ' engagement to the Duke . You two no good cowards ! Buffalo Bill , what 's the meaning of this ? These two good for nothings tried to get me to order Annie to lose this match . That 's a lie . I wish it were . But I 'm ashamed to say I did ask her , and when she turned me down , these two fine gentlemen kidnapped her . Jeffrey , can you forgive me for having doubted your word ? Sure , Your Majesty . You are more generous with me , than I shall be with the Duke . Your Majesty , I know nothing about this . My aide acted on his own . You are responsible for any act committed in your name . I cannot go home without the Princess . We must not lose sight of the alliances this marriage would provide . Our country cannot be made any stronger , by an alliance with men who are so weak ! ( DINGS ) Green light ! Guess the wedding 's off . Yeah , think maybe now I have a chance with the Princess ? No way . It just might be one of the great love stories of all time . Oh , yeah , the Princess and the pauper . JEFFREY ... If you wanna learn more about Buffalo Bill and Annie Oakley , Queen Victoria or Dr. Schweitzer , take a voyage down to your public library . It 's all in books ! The defendant , Phineas Bogg , disobeyed all rules and statutes of the voyager code . That 's a lie . The boy must be returned to the exact time and place Bogg found him . Give it up . Let 's go . ( EXCLAIMS ) If we 're gonna have any chance of clearing ourselves , we 've got to get out of here . Phineas . Don 't touch that ! Bogg . Bogg ! BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! ( PLUMMETING ) ( GROANING ) Hey , why don 't you tell me the next time we 're leaving ? I didn 't know we were going anywhere . Well , I didn 't trigger the Omni . Neither did I. Then where are we ? But the Omni ... The Omni 's not talking . Looks like some kind of courtroom . Bogg , I 'm scared . ( LAUGHS ) Hey . Nothing to be scared about . We 're back in school . School ? This doesn 't look like P.S. 132 . Not your school . This is my alma mater , Voyager School . JEFFREY : Then what are we doing here ? I don 't know . Must be a class reunion or a homecoming or something . I can 't wait to see the old gang . ( DOOR OPENS ) Susan . Hello , Phineas . You look just as great as I remember . Boy , is it good to see you again ! Bogg ? Bogg ? Susan , this is ... Jeffrey , remember ? Jeffrey . We know all about the young Mr. Jones . So , this is the little boy voyager , huh ? Oh , stop it , Drake . You 're scaring him . Phineas Bogg . It 's been a long time since we last met . I could 've gone a few more centuries without seeing you again . Who is this guy ? Bogg and I were in the same voyager class . He 's a voyager ? Yeah , Drake 's an old classmate . You guys were friends ? I wouldn 't go that far . Yes , but a lot has changed since then . BOGG : Looks like a new Omni . Model 3-1650 , open-time calibration , state-of-the-art . But most important , there 's a new voyager credo . Discipline and order above all else . That 's the direction the new voyager majority has mandated . What new mandate ? What 's he talking about ? Drake 's been elected code-violation prosecutor . There are more and more voyagers who support the new movement of discipline . Voyagers on every level . Field workers , administrators , even judges . Is he serious ? Are things changing that much ? I 'm afraid so . And it looks as if you 're Drake 's latest example . Me ? What did I do ? You 've done your duty as a voyager . But Drake 'll make it look as if you 've subverted the code . These are very serious charges , Phineas . But Bogg 's the best voyager you 've got . Many fine men and women have been banished , thanks to Drake . Bogg ? Now , don 't worry . The tribunal will be fair . Well , let 's hope so . If they find you guilty , you 'll be banished . Where ? A tiny desert island , uncharted . Without the Omni . ( DOOR OPENS ) SUSAN : Drake 's already got Brindle on his side . Yeah , well , I always figured she twisted her bun a little tight . BOGG : Hey , that 's Professor Garth . The best teacher in the whole school . He really made me understand what being a voyager is all about . SUSAN : Well , he 's your one hope . He 's the last elder who stood against Drake . JEFFREY : What about him ? SUSAN : That 's Kane . He respects Garth , but he 's still afraid of Drake . Drake isn 't above using anything he can to win his case . Real hotshot , huh ? Thirty trials , thirty convictions . Great . I 'll just defend myself the best I can . The best we can . I 'm your defense attorney . ( BANGING GAVEL ) This court will come to order . Is the prosecution ready ? Yes , Your Honor . GARTH : And defense ? I haven 't had much time with the defendant . If I could have a little time to discuss the evidence ... Your Honor , I believe the evidence should be debated openly in this court . Unless , of course , the accused feels the need for secret meetings to manufacture his defense . I don 't even know what I 'm defending myself against . Will the prosecution please read the charges ? I 'd be happy to , Your Honor . I bet . The defendant , Phineas Bogg , has consistently and purposefully disobeyed all rules and statutes of the voyager code . That 's a lie . ( BANGING GAVEL ) GARTH : Please , keep your client under control . Well , he should have a chance to defend himself . If he can . Let him take the stand . Voyager Bogg , would you give the bailiff your Omni ? BOGG : My Omni ? The court needs your device for the evidence stored in its memory unit . Now , remember , all those in this court are under the voyager oath to speak only the truth . Yes , sir . Proceed with the charges . The defendant , Phineas Bogg , violated territorial parameters by traveling to the year 1982 , a year Bogg is not authorized to operate in ... I was trying to get to 1492 . My Omni malfunctioned . ... and did , on that unauthorized mission , enter the room of this boy , Jeffrey Jones , and did lose his Guidebook . Where 's Columbus , kid ? Where am I ? JEFFREY : He didn 't lose it . My dog took it . BRINDLE : Phineas Bogg , voyager , overpowered by a boy 's dog ? Why were you not able to recover your book ? My hands were kind of full at the time . With what ? With Jeffrey . Look . Come on , Ralph , give it up . Let 's go . ( EXCLAIMS ) ( JEFFREY YELLING ) JEFFREY : Bogg saved my life ! If he hadn 't jumped out of that window for me , I would 've been all over the pavement . DRAKE : If Mr. Bogg had not violated the code , the boy 's life would not have needed rescuing . Your Honor , heroism is often a matter of circumstance . Yes , I quite agree . And since these circumstances were caused by a malfunctioning Omni , it appears that Mr. Bogg is blameless . Then who do we blame for the violations ? This boy ? The kid didn 't do anything wrong . DRAKE : Not willfully . Which brings us to the most serious charge , the boy being used on voyager missions . My Omni couldn 't get him back home to 1982 . There must have been an adequate care facility for the child somewhere in time . An orphanage ? Yes . I figured he would be better off with me . Then you must be held responsible for that decision . I made Bogg take me with him . BOGG ... Nice to know you , kid . Sorry for any inconvenience , but I work alone . Oh , no , you don 't . You got me into this , you get me out . I got school tomorrow . Can 't take you back . I don 't even know where I am . France , 1918 . Revolutionary War . First World War . What ? I just wanted to help . Your motives are not in question here . But an experienced voyager should have known better than to take along with him such a young , untrained civilian on voyager missions , involving matters of such historical importance . The kid is a historical ace . I couldn 't ask for a better partner . Well , perhaps Mr. Bogg 's memories are shadowed by sentiment . Hmm ? The mission in question started in Rome . 44 B.C. Caesar had been murdered on the Senate floor , and Voyager Bogg took Cleopatra out of the city . I had always hoped that I 'd bump into you someday . BOGG : I didn 't do it on purpose . When she kissed me , she pushed the Omni . Come on , let 's wrap this up . Bogg ? Bogg ? ... back on your throne in Egypt . I 'd rather be queen of this magnificent land . ( WOLF WHISTLE ) There 's nothing for me back there . Jeffrey is back there . Then you go back and get him . I 'm taking you with me . ( WOLF WHISTLE ) Now , what 's the harm in my looking around this great , glorious land ? I 'm in no danger here . MAN : Lucky Lindy 's landed in France ! ( ALL CHEERING ) BOGG : Cleopatra ? Cleopatra ? So , Voyager Bogg left Cleopatra in New York . I didn 't leave her , I lost her . And I wouldn 't have lost her if I didn 't have to go back and get Jeffrey . Exactly . But Jeffrey ended up helping me find her . Then you trust this young man . With my life . Well , we can only hope he was more careful with your life than he was with your Omni . JEFFREY ... You 've wrecked it . It 's totaled ! Now I 'll never get back to him . What ? You stupid idiot . Now I 'll never get back to Bogg ! Hey , kid , easy . It 's all right , Kruesi . Let him yell . Don 't touch those parts ! Move one out of place , and I 'll never be able to put it back together again . You can get it back ? Kid , this is Thomas Edison . He probably invented the thing . Well , the Omni did work better than ever after that . Your Honor , all the episodes in question did end successfully . I appreciate the skill and the judgment required in field work . The last-minute decisions that must be made . But even in the field , Your Honor , there 's no substitute for careful planning and rigid adherence to the rules and regulations . What do you know about it , Drake ? You 've been riding that desk ever since graduation . You are on trial here , not Mr. Drake . But Bogg shouldn 't be on trial . JEFFREY : He 's the best voyager there is ! Mr. Bogg was not class valedictorian . But his record does appear to be beyond reproach . Until he took the boy . He didn 't take me . I wanted to be with him . A good voyager cannot be such a bad companion for a boy . I would agree , if only the boy 's life had not been put in jeopardy . Are you charging this voyager with intentional disregard for Jeffrey Jones ' safety ? Yes . That 's a lie . Is a gladiator school a fit place for a young boy ? DRAKE : I think fighting in a training ring in Capua is very dangerous work indeed . Bogg , look ! Bogg , over here . Now , Bogg , now ! I never would 've let that animal hurt Jeffrey . Yet you endangered the boy once again during World War I. Shoot them ! Shoot him . I am ! Then hit him . JEFFREY : He 's coming right at us . JEFFREY : No , stay up , we 're gonna stall . BOGG : We 're gonna what ? Pull Up ! Pull up ! I can 't . BOGG ... We 're gonna go down , kid ! Your Honor , I object . No , I object . I object to this man using this boy , a defenseless youngster , to serve his own selfish purposes . It 's not true . Make him stop ! I can explain all this . He 's twisting everything around . I love Jeffrey . I 'd never let anything happen to him . The facts speak for themselves , Your Honor . Your Honor , may the defendant have the chance to answer these charges ? Oh , yes . But be warned , Phineas Bogg , you have much to answer for . You know , the prosecutor 's turning everything around so it looks bad for Bogg . He 's doing a pretty good job of it , too . Just like he did with all the others . Why doesn 't somebody stop him ? We 're trying to , Jeffrey , but with each conviction Drake becomes more powerful . JEFFREY : He 's a real creep . Never was my favorite person , either , but he 's entitled to his opinion . No matter how stupid it is ? Jeffrey 's right . Drake 's ideas always were a little off-center . He 's considered the brilliant young maverick now . Brilliant ? Phineas , he was class valedictorian . He cheated . I know that sounds like sour grapes , but it 's the truth . You don 't have to convince me . His evidence always does fall into place a little too neatly . You think he makes up stuff just to get voyagers like Bogg in trouble ? Unfortunately , what I feel and what I can prove are two different things . Well , he 's the hotshot prosecutor and I 'm just a dumb field worker . You were smart enough to be whatever you wanted . You just never applied yourself . Yeah , Bogg , you told me you never paid much attention because there was this really sexy blonde in your class , and ... ( BOGG CHUCKLES ) Sorry . Oh , really ? I never caught you at it . Oh , well , you know me . Subtle , discreet . I wish you 'd been a little less subtle . Give a girl a chance . ( DOOR OPENS ) ( GAVEL BANGING ) The voyager ethics tribunal is again in session . Your Honor , I 'd like to call the defendant , Phineas Bogg , to the stand . Your Honor , we intend to show that Phineas Bogg and Jeffrey Jones may have violated the letter , but not the spirit , of the voyager code . So , Phineas Bogg , you find yourself in the field without your voyager Guidebook . That 's right . But I had Jeffrey . Are you telling this tribunal that Jeffrey became your Guidebook ? Yes . I 'll admit I was a little leery about it at first myself . ( WHIRRING ) And I haven 't got the foggiest idea what I 'm supposed to do . ( BABY GURGLING ) You got an idea , kid ? This is Egypt . 1450 B.C. ( BOGG CHUCKLES ) Moses ! What ? You be careful with him , will you ? He 's Moses . ( LAUGHS ) Moses ? Moses was an old man with white whiskers . Looks like Santa Claus with a part in the middle . What are you doing ? Putting him back in the water . He 'll drown . ( SHUSHING ) Look . Moses was found by the Pharaoh 's daughter in the Nile . So you see , if it weren 't for Jeffrey , I wouldn 't have known what to do . If Bogg had not lost his Guidebook , he would not have needed the boy telling him what to do . ( CHUCKLING ) Yes . I 'm afraid a boy , however bright , cannot equal the knowledge of a voyager handbook . Begging your pardon , sir , but the kid knows much more than a Guidebook . More even than some voyagers . For example ? There was this one time when we had to get Babe Ruth to stop pitching and start hitting . SUSAN : And how did Jeffrey help ? He taught me how to pitch 1982 style , and I struck every batter out . And that led to Mr. Ruth quitting the team . Is that true ? BOGG : Sort of . But Jeff taught Babe to hit 1982 style . MAN ... Hit it , Babe . Come on , Babe , rip it . So Jeffrey 's knowledge of modern baseball helped on that assignment . Yeah , and the kid 's got guts , too . A voyager 's got to have spirit , so when everybody 's telling you you 're wrong , you got the courage to fight back . And a voyager 's got to be able to make people take a new look at a situation . To give people the confidence to take that one extra chance . ( WHIRRING ) MORGAN : Pulling me and my bank out of this mess . MAN : J. P ! Mr. Morgan ! Yes , son ? I haven 't got much time . You haven 't got much sense , either . What ? Please , son . Thomas Edison is the greatest inventor alive . The phonograph , the repeating telegraph . He even made the telephone work better . That is not what 's at issue . Look , you wanna make some money , right ? That 's the general idea , yes . Well , then what other inventor would you rather invest your money in ? Thomas Edison 's got a track record that just won 't quit . Track record . Interesting expression . You miss out on the electric light , and you 're gonna miss out on an invention that 's going to change the face of this world . It 's a gold mine here . You 're looking at a fortune . All right , all right . I give in . Thank God ! On two conditions . The first is that you , young man , come to see me when you 're an adult . I could use a man with your persuasion . Second is that I see some positive results in 48 hours . Otherwise , Tom , we 're back where we started . Good day . EDISON : All right , Upton . Let 's give it a try . Yeah . More . An inch more . That 's it . ( ALL CHEERING ) So , the court can see that the boy 's fortitude and conviction have served the voyager code well . I am impressed with the boy 's ability . He does seem to be quite a bit beyond his years . In mind , perhaps . But precocious boys can never be trusted with the work of a man . Or a woman . I don 't know about that . There was another time when Jeffrey rescued me from right under the noses of a bunch of witch hunters . MAN ... Bring the devil to his end now ! JEFFREY : No , no , no . You can 't ! It 's not right ! Will Satan help you , devil ? Or do you need this talisman to set you free ? ( LAUGHING ) PEOPLE : Burn , devil . Burn ! ALL : Burn , devil , burn ! Burn , devil , burn ! He 's vanished ! I think that story says less about the boy than the voyager so dependent upon his help . Phineas Bogg is the perfect example of the type of voyager that weakens our ranks . I think you 'll find this another example of Phineas Bogg 's violation of voyager code . One where he allowed a pretty face to sway his judgment . Placing Abraham Lincoln 's life in grave danger , and nearly changing the outcome of the Civil War . And you 're sure about the route ? Absolutely . Are you sure of your men ? They 'll be in place . Make sure they know whose side I 'm on . Don 't worry . There 's gonna be another change in plans . Jane Phillips , a traitor . I can 't believe it . Not a traitor , Mr. Lincoln , a patriot . Two patriots , in fact . So , as Phineas Bogg conspired to kidnap Lincoln ... That 's a lie . Your Honor , that is the sad , pathetic truth . This man is unfit to be a voyager . The pathetic truth , Drake , is that you don 't know the first thing about being a voyager ! Order ! Your Honor , I move that that remark be stricken from the record . It 's not relevant to his case . Mr. Drake , that was an improper remark . Though I 'm afraid that Voyager Bogg 's execution of his duty is the essence of this case . But , Your Honor , my client has testified . That was a total misrepresentation of what took place . I 'm afraid the court is obliged to believe only what it sees . But , Your Honor , that was not ... The witness may step down . We must now weigh the evidence presented here . And our decision will affect not only the career of Voyager Phineas Bogg , and the future of young Jeffrey Jones , but the fate of all voyagers . Of course , ultimately , we 're charged with upholding the voyager code , and the safety of the past , present and future , which that code and all voyagers are sworn to defend . Court is adjourned . BOGG : It didn 't happen that way , I swear . Yeah , it was Bogg that saved Lincoln . Why would the Omni show it like that ? I don 't know , but somehow Drake always manages to come up with that kind of damaging evidence . The only way he could 've come up with something like that is if he messed with the Omni . There 's no use arguing with the tribunal . If we 're gonna have any chance of clearing ourselves , we 've got to get out of here . SUSAN : Phineas . Sorry , Susan , there 's no other way . Don 't touch that ! JEFFREY : Bogg , don 't ! Bogg ! Well , kid , I guess we 're not going anywhere after all . You are . An uncharted desert island , remember ? I think you 're jumping the gun a little bit , don 't you think ? Maybe the jury will clear me on the charges . Oh , fat chance . That Drake already has Garth convinced . One look at that evidence and anybody 'd be convinced . I 've always known Drake was capable of anything , including perjury , to further his own ambitions . How are we gonna make the judges believe that ? Sometimes it 's very difficult to prove when someone 's lying . In school we all knew Drake cheated on his exams , but nobody could prove it . BOGG : Until he gave himself away . How ? He sure kept track of how he did it . Every time he cheated and got away with it , it was like winning a battle or something . He kept a diary ? Yeah . I found all his little notes in a copy of The Prince by Machiavelli . JEFFREY : And did you turn him in ? No , I didn 't wanna be a snitch . Just him knowing I knew was enough . I 'm sure that 's why he hates me . What did you do with the book ? I gave it back to him . A place to record all his other victories ... And where are you going ? Don 't worry , I 'll be back in time . And Jeffrey , nobody 's gonna be banished . Where 's she going ? I think she 's gonna try and find something to clear us of the charges . Funny , when we were doing all those things , it sure didn 't feel like we were committing any crimes . I thought we were doing some pretty good work . We 're gonna get punished anyway . Ah , what 's the worst they can do to us ? Separate us . Yeah . Bogg , I don 't wanna leave you . It 's gonna be okay . No , it 's not gonna be okay . It 'll never be okay again . Whatever happens , you 've got the rest of your life ahead of you . Think of all the things you 're gonna do , all the people that are gonna come into your life . And all the people are gonna leave me . Jeffrey , don 't talk like that . Why not ? It 's the truth . First my parents , and now you . I was just getting so I could go through the night without having bad dreams about my folks . ( SNIFFLING ) And now I 'm gonna have those dreams all over again about you . ( SOBBING ) You 're not gonna have any dreams about me , good or bad . How do you know ? Just believe me , you 're lucky . You 're not gonna remember anything . You mean I 'm not gonna remember about being a voyager ? Yeah . And I suppose I 'll forget about the Omni . Yeah , you will . And I 'll forget about you ? No , Bogg , that 's not gonna happen . I 'm never gonna let that happen . You can 't fight it , kid , it 's the voyager code . Nothing can make me forget all we 've been through . Like the time we helped the Wright brothers so they 'd invent the airplane . Out of the way , boy . It 's suicide ! I 'm a voyager , kid . Sometimes you gotta bite the bullet . No ! Bogg , don 't ! No ! Phineas ! Our glider ! Will , it 's our glider . It 's flying . ( PEOPLE LAUGHING ) It 's flying ! Phineas . Look at him ! " Bite the bullet . " I 'll never forget that . Yeah , too bad all my messages didn 't get through as clearly . What do you mean ? I always listened to you . Sure , you did . Like the time I told you to stay away from Billy the Kid . BOGG ... All you wanted to do was shoot that gun . We 're gonna stop here for a spell . Why ? I 'm waiting for my men . ( SNAKE RATTLING ) Look out ! ( GUN FIRES ) ( HORSES NEIGHING ) Wow ! That was fast ! I wish I could do that . You mean you haven 't learned to shoot yet ? I 've never even picked up a gun before . Well , not a real one at least . Then I 'm gonna show you how . I got some tins of beans in my saddle bags . Make good targets . Wait a minute . I don 't think that 's a good idea . He 's gotta learn sometime . You can 't survive out here without knowing how to use a gun . Come on , Bogg . Would you excuse us a minute ? Bogg , how many kids get the chance to learn how to shoot from Billy the Kid ? None , I hope . We 're just gonna be shooting tin cans . No way . Please , Bogg , it 'll be a good experience . I said no ! That 's final . Here you go . Try your hand at it , kid . BOGG ... Well , that time you did listen . JEFFREY ... Yeah , but I didn 't learn my lesson until I saw how you handled the gun . I don 't need this . Give me a gun . Somebody give me a gun . I 'm Billy the Kid . Billy 's not much without his gun , is he ? Come back here . I mean it ! Not much with it , either . Maybe this is all happening for the best . I don 't know ... Maybe I should 've left you with your great-grandparents . ( SINGING ) Holy night All is calm All is bright Round yon Virgin Mother and Child Holy Infant so tender and mild Sleep in heavenly peace Sleep in heavenly peace Silent night Holy night Shepherds quake At the sight Glories stream from heaven above ... Where 's Bogg ? Jeffrey . Jeffrey , wait . Jeff , wait . Bogg ! Bogg , wait . We were singing Christmas carols , and all of a sudden you were just gone . Where 's your coat ? You 're gonna catch a cold . Bogg , what 's going on ? Where are you going ? I 'm leaving . Leaving ? Without me ? Yeah . Without you . But why ? Your great-grandfather can say it a million times better than I can . Say what ? That they can take care of you better than I can . There 's nothing wrong with the way you take care of me . Being a voyager is no life for a kid . Greek food one day , Chinese food the next . No holidays ... Did you ever hear me complaining ? Yeah . A lot . Now go back there and get warm and happy . Bogg , stop it ! What do you think you 're doing ? What I should 've done a long time ago . Giving you a home with a mother and father who love you . But I don 't want them . I want you . You can have a family . But I 've already got a family ! Don 't you understand ? It 's you . ( SOBBING ) Please don 't let them take me , Bogg . I don 't think I can stop them , Jeff . But if they do take you , I 'll make them take you back to before I came along . ( SNIFFLING ) Before the accident . Before your parents died . I promise . That 's a promise I won 't break . ( DOOR OPENS ) This is it , kid . Where 's Susan ? I don 't know . But they 've got to wait for her . Whatever happens , we 're still a team . Mmm-hmm . Voyagers . ( GAVEL BANGING ) Court is back in session . Come on , kid . Time to bite the bullet . Will the defendant please rise ? Where is your counsel ? She 's trying to find the evidence that 'll prove Drake 's been lying . Oh , this is outrageous . The prosecution has submitted a new piece of evidence , the substance of which takes the matter out of the court 's hands . Bailiff , would you please escort the boy from the courtroom ? Look , I stood trial . Am I guilty or innocent ? Bogg ? It 's all right , go ahead . Voyager Bogg , it is not a matter of guilt or innocence . BOGG : I have a right to know what Drake 's come up with now . Would the defendant please approach the bench ? The new information involves the boy . Jeffrey 's never done a truly bad thing in his life . No , it 's not a matter of the good or the bad that he has done , but of the good he has yet to do . See for yourself . Jeff 's supposed to do all this ? Yes , according to the voyager logs . Got quite a future ahead of him . Yes , he 's obviously destined for great things . But as civilian Jeffrey Jones , not as a voyager . And in his own time , not traveling through the cosmos with an Omni . I 'm afraid Drake is right . The boy must be returned to 1982 . He must be allowed to grow up and fulfill his own destiny . Let 's tell the boy and get on to more important matters . No , I 'll tell him . And I 'll take him back . Very well . The boy will be returned to the room where Bogg found him . No ! Voyager Bogg , I thought it was determined that the boy would be returned . Yes , but not as an orphan . I want to bring him back to the time before his parents died . DRAKE : Your Honor , this is absurd . The boy must be returned to the exact time and place Bogg found him . Look , Drake , you can take your gripe out on me , but don 't ruin the kid 's life . Would it change history if Jeff 's parents were spared ? That is hardly the point . Then what 's the point ? No , history will not change if the boy is returned to his parents . Then there 's no reason the court should not show leniency . DRAKE : You mean pity . Look , as long as history doesn 't change ... The boy must be returned to the time after his parents ' death ! You got to make this exception . Once an exception is made , the code will be meaningless . And what about the voyager code ? This tribunal was called to uphold the rules , not violate them . Drake , that 's just one more lie . Voyager Drake has managed to make a career out of it . I do hope defense counsel understands that she will be held responsible for these accusations . I 'll be proud to . Hmm . What has Machiavelli got to do with all this ? Machiavelli 's philosophy was " the end justifies the means . " These are not the writings of Machiavelli . Those were written by his best disciple , Voyager Drake . That evidence is inadmissible . Sorry , Drake , it 's too late . These pages are a record of the prosecution 's habit of falsifying documents , and tampering with the Omni memory recorder in order to convict innocent voyagers . Bring the boy back . Why , Drake ? Why ? Because it had to be done for the cause . The only cause you ever served was your own . And why would you be foolish enough to keep this incriminating evidence ? One day those words will vindicate me and all the work that I 've tried to do . The future shall judge me as a hero . Until then , you 'll deal with the judgments of this tribunal , and they shall be harsh . This court has no hold on me . Bailiff , stop that man . Hey , wait a minute . You 're not going anywhere . Stop him . ( PLUMMETING ) Bogg . The Omni . Don 't worry , I got it . Give it to me . Not so fast , hotshot . Hand me that Omni immediately . We 've got to get out of here . Look , Drake , we 're gonna check things out before we run scared . ( BEEPING ) Red light . Where are we ? Mexico , 1836 . Bogg , look . Señor Houston , do you wish a blindfold ? No . If I 'm gonna die , I 'll die looking at the land I 've fought for . The territory of Texas . Bogg , that 's Sam Houston . In a minute he 's gonna be the late Sam Houston . He 's gotta live to see Texas become independent from Mexico . Texas ? Never heard of it . Don 't let them hear you say that . ( GUNS FIRING ) BOGG : Those are Texans ? JEFFREY : Yeah . They 're not doing very well at helping their pal . He 's gotta be rescued . He 's gonna be the first president of the New Republic of Texas . Then we better get him out of there so he doesn 't miss the party . Come on . ( GUNS FIRING ) I 'll get Mr. Houston . You stay here with him . Bogg ? The code does mean something . A voyager doesn 't leave a fallen comrade . Bogg , no ! Texas forever ! ( MAN YELLING ) Men , over here ! Someone help ! The boy is trapped ! JEFFREY : Bogg ! HOUSTON : Help ! Help the boy . Hurry ! JEFFREY : I 'm okay , get the dynamite . Bogg , behind you . ( GRUNTING ) Boy , are you all right ? Yeah . We 'll keep those soldiers busy till you two fellows get out of here . Thanks for all your help . Any men willing to fight for the Republic of Texas are worth saving . Good luck . Bye . Drake 's gone . Great , now we 're really stranded . No Omni and no Guidebook . Yeah , but we 've got each other . Then I guess we 'll get along just fine . JEFFREY : Well , Bogg , where do we start ? BOGG : The first thing I wanna do is get something to eat . Not so fast , guys . How 'd you know where to find us ? Woman 's intuition , and my voyager locator . ( DINGS ) Well , well , the prodigal son has returned . Sir , I can explain ... No , there 's no need . It 's this court that owes you an apology . Now , where 's Drake ? He took the Omni and disappeared . Well , he must be brought back to this tribunal . He 's somewhere out there in time . Huh ? He doesn 't scan on the locator . Someone 's bound to find him wherever things are getting messed up . Well , maybe it will be the two of you . Us ? GARTH : Yes . You mean Bogg and me ? You are voyagers , aren 't you ? We were waiting for you to tell us if we were or not . Well , you are , both of you . Congratulations . But what about all the great stuff Jeffrey 's supposed to do ? Drake was correct . The boy has many important things to do . But what Drake didn 't tell the court was he does them as a voyager . You mean he was supposed to be a voyager all along ? ( GARTH CHUCKLING ) You didn 't fall into Jeffrey 's room by accident . Phineas Bogg , Jeffrey Jones , get back into the field . Yes , sir . Here is your old Omni . Yeah , we 're partners again ! Here 's your new Guidebook ... JEFFREY ... If you want to learn more about Sam Houston and the Texas fight for independence , take a voyage down to your public library . It 's all in books ! What 's that ? MAN : Some kind of iron horse . MacArthur 's in grave danger . If you 're not out of my sight in 10 seconds , I 'll lock you both in the brig . The Japanese are going to attack Pearl Harbor . Is this a prank call ? A lot of people on that base are going to get killed , and I don 't want you to be one of them . ( MACHINE GUNS FIRING ) Bogg , look , it 's MacArthur ! BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! ( MISSILE WHISTLING ) ( WIND WHISTLING ) ( BOTH GRUNTING ) I have a funny feeling this isn 't a resort . Not with all this noise and lousy weather . ( BEEPING ) Leyte Island , the Philippines , 1944 . World War II . This is great ! Great ? You 're getting a little warped , kid . No war is great . ( ENGINE FALTERING ) That guy 's in trouble , and I 'm going after him . You stay put . Fat chance . Banzai ! ( GRUNTING ) Hey , hold it . You okay ? Yeah . Who are you guys ? How come you 're not in uniform ? We 're with the USO . USO ? Here ? What we need are reinforcements . We 're getting the heck beat out of us . But in 1944 , America 's supposed to be winning on Leyte Island . Tell them that . But what about MacArthur ? He led the attack on this island that totally totaled the enemy . MacArthur died over two years ago at the attack on Pearl Harbor . Pearl Harbor ! Yeah , he was there for some top secret meeting . Listen , I got a lot of wounded waiting for this medicine . Well , these guys won 't mind if we take their car . Hey , now you 're talking . They 're not gonna shoot at one of their own . What are you gonna do with these devils ? Don 't you worry about that . Just get that medicine to the wounded . Thanks a lot . Bogg , MacArthur wasn 't in Pearl Harbor during the attack . He was in the Philippines . BOGG : Wrong history , that 's why we got a red light . Without MacArthur , America could lose the South Pacific . SOLDIER : Thanks , guys . Good luck . ( BEEPING ) Okay , kid , date ? Well , we should get there the day before the attack , December 6th , 1941 . Sayonara , guys . ( WIND WHISTLING ) ( BEEPING ) December 6th , 1941 . Pearl Harbor . Right on target . Tomorrow , that 'll be a bad joke . Schofield Barracks ? You sure you have the right date ? No one here looks very concerned . That 's because no one knows what 's gonna happen except us and the Japanese . All these people have no idea that tomorrow the world is gonna change . Well , if MacArthur 's here for a secret meeting , nobody 's gonna know except the top brass . We 'd better find the base commander . Right . Excuse us , could you tell us where we could find one of the base commanders ? How am I supposed to know ? This is an Army base . I 'm in the Navy . Yeah , we 're just here for the big battle tonight . You know about the battle ? Yeah . Who you rooting for ? Rooting for ? The Americans , who else ? Well , sure , we 're all Americans . Listen , we 've got the hottest trumpet player this side of the mainland but the Army , they 've got a mean man on the skins . What are you talking about ? What do you think , silly ? The Battle of the Bands . Isn 't that why you 're in costume ? Oh , yeah , yeah , sure , that 's why we 're in costume . Well , listen , we 've got to take a powder . Tina and me are in the dance contest tonight , and we got to rest up . Listen , I hope we see you there . It 's gonna be hot . Yeah , good luck . See you . How come we 're not wearing costumes ? I didn 't know we were supposed to . Why did you give me this assignment ? JACK : Well , it 's what you 've been bugging me for , isn 't it ? Yeah , but not this kind . Look , the officer of the day is very busy with last minute details for MacArthur 's meeting with the fleet captains . Now somebody had to fill in . And since it 's a desk job , and I 'm a woman , you figure I can handle it . Well , you can , can 't you ? Yes , but I 've been trained as an intelligence operative . Why don 't I get any of those kind of assignments ? Well , maybe the commander of this post doesn 't think you 're ready . You 're the commander of this post ! That 's right . I 'm as ready as any of your other civilian operatives , and you know it . Now why are you holding me back ? Holding you back ? Listen , young lady , it 's time you faced the truth . You 've only gotten as far as you have because I 'm your father . That 's not true . I 've worked harder than anybody for this position . Working hard is not enough . Because I 'm a woman . Yes . But , look , I know that 's not fair , but that 's the way the government is . And that 's the way the world is . You have to do better than the men . You can 't make a mistake and you can 't break down , because when you do , they 're gonna be waiting to nail you . I can handle that . I can do the job . Well , then prove it . How can I when I 'm sitting behind this desk ? Look , it 's like I said , no matter what the job , you have to do better . Now don 't forget , we have dinner with General MacArthur at 2000 hours . That 's 8 : 00 ... That 's 8 : 00 p.m. Yes . Sure , that assignment I can handle . Bogg , we came here to find MacArthur , not the Battle of the Bands . Right . Those MPs ought to know where we can find him . Come on . Hey , you guys , excuse me . Do you know where we can find a commander ? You wanna see a commander ? Yes , sir . Yeah , we have something really important to discuss with him . ( SCOFFS ) Don 't tell me . Your pirate ship captured one of our cruisers . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) Look , guys , we 're not kidding around . This is very important . How about showing us your IDs ? IDs ? IDs . Must 've left it in my other uniform . I could lock you in the stockade for that . Hey , look , can you just take us to one of the commanders ? Commanders are very busy men . Send in your request for a meeting , and they 'll see you in about a month . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) We need to talk to a commander about MacArthur . I think you got their attention . Wait , what are we doing here ? We have to see the commander . First you see the officer of the day . Then you see a commander . Keep an eye on them , Tom . You know how pirates are . Miss Knox , where is the officer of the day ? He 's busy . I was left in charge . What is it ? Maybe I 'd better get someone else . Sergeant , I was left in charge by my father , the Commander . ( EXHALES ) Yes , ma 'am . We 've got a couple of kooks out there who want to talk to a commander . Kooks ? What kind of kooks ? There 's a man dressed like a pirate and a young boy . And when I asked the young boy his date of birth , he said , " October 3rd , 1970 . " ( LAUGHS ) Well , maybe he 's just having some fun with you . What do they want to see the commander about ? They know MacArthur 's here . They say he 's in great danger . They know about MacArthur ? How ? I don 't know . Do you think it may have leaked out ? It 's impossible ! It 's top secret ! What do you want me to do with them ? Release them . What ? Sergeant , release them . Yes , ma 'am . Release them . What ? It 's an order . Look ... Okay , you two , get out ! Look , we 've got to see the commander . Well , you 're not going to . And if you know what 's good for you , you 'll get off this base . Don 't you understand ? MacArthur is in grave danger . If you 're not out of my sight in 10 seconds , I 'll lock you both in the brig . But MacArthur ... Forget it , we 'll get out of here . ( SIGHS ) What are we going to do ? Look , security is a little loose around here , don 't you think ? Yeah . Well , if MacArthur were here for a secret meeting he 'd be under heavy security , right ? Right . Well , we 're going to find that area . Come on . ( ENGINE RUMBLING ) Getting ready for tonight , huh ? Oh , yeah . You kidding ? I was the jitterbug champ of the Bronx two years in a row . I 'm gonna show these hicks a thing or two . We were wondering , you wouldn 't know of any heavy security area on base , would you ? Sure , Thompson compound . Where is it ? It 's down the beach , about half a mile . Thanks . Hey , you 'll never get in there , especially dressed like that . Bogg , don 't you think we should try to warn the base about the attack ? You can 't change history , kid . Hey , you wanna get some lunch ? We may not get another chance before we reach the security area . I am kind of hungry . You know , Bogg , it is kind of hard not to try . What ? To change history . Oh , yeah , I know . One of the drawbacks of the job . Excuse me . Excuse me . ( EXCLAIMS ) Oh , excuse me . It 's okay . I 'm so clumsy . My pleasure . My souvenirs . You sure do have a lot of them . Well , you know , I 'm from Omaha . Figures . This is my first time in Hawaii . I was with a tour group but I got separated from them somehow . So , now I guess , I 'm kind of lost . Where are you guys from ? Oh , we kind of travel all over . Yeah ? Yeah . My name 's Jackie . Phineas Bogg . Hi . This is Jeffrey Jones . Hi . Hi . Will you two look at that background ? Would you mind if I got a shot of you for the folks back in Omaha ? They 're gonna love this . Excuse me , could you get out of my way ? Thank you . Bogg , we have things to do . Excuse me , Jackie , we kind of have someplace to go . Oh , sure . I don 't want to impose . Oh , no . You 're not imposing . It 's just the kid was hungry , and we thought we 'd get some lunch . Lunch ! Great . I 'm starving . Way to go , ace . JACKIE : Just one more shot with the pineapple . Oh , that 's wonderful . That 's her fifth roll of film . Don 't complain . She bought lunch , didn 't she ? Big deal . The whole thing cost 15 cents . Whoever heard of eating a hot dog with pineapple on it anyway ? You know , Bogg , we 're never gonna be able to sneak on the base with her tagging along . Don 't worry , I got it all figured out . ( GROANS ) Hey , guys ... Hold it , there . That 's a great shot . This lady is unreal . Don 't be long . The coast is clear . Come on . Come on , let 's get out of here . Okay , kid , that 's where we 've got to go . And there 's our ticket in . Come on . I gotta hand it to you , Bogg , this is a great idea . I have my moments . Hey , fellows , what are you doing in the back of the truck ? How did she find us ? I think she 's part bloodhound . So much for sneaking in . Where were you guys going in there ? Just hitching a ride . You could 've got us in a lot of trouble , you know . Oh , jeez , Phineas , I 'm sorry . It 's just that I thought we must 've missed each other when I went to get another roll of film . Look , lady , we didn 't miss you , we left you on purpose . Hey , Jeff , easy . She 's all alone . Is that true , Phineas ? No ! We were ... No , that 's all right , you don 't have to explain . I mean , I 've been dumped before by an entire tour group . I know I 'm a pest . No , you 're not . It 's just that we have business to do , you see , dangerous business , and we didn 't want you to get hurt . Hey , she 's got the Omni ! German or Japanese ? Huh ? Neither . Dates , places , even a globe . What is this ? Nothing . Really , you better give that back . Hey , stop that ! Freeze , buster . What is this ? Who are you ? Jackie Knox , Army Intelligence . You 're both under arrest . What ? Since when does Army Intelligence dress like a day at the beach ? I 'm a civilian operative . ( GROANS ) Oh , Jackie , we were having so much fun together before ... From now on , military procedure dictates that you only address me as Miss Knox . Okay . Miss Knox , we were just spending the day at the beach . Oh , sure . That 's what they all say . I knew she was going to be trouble . Okay , are you going to tell me what this device does , or would you rather wait and talk to Colonel Knox ? I thought you were Knox . Right . The Colonel 's my father . Great , then you can take us to him . Who else would I take two captured spies to ? Oh , brother . You know , this looks like some kind of a radio . Wait till my father sees this . Don 't touch the button . Grab her , kid . ( WHOOSHING ) When are you riders ever gonna learn that no one gets through this pass alive . ( WIND WHISTLING ) Sorry about that . Where 'd they come from ? I don 't know , but I don 't want to stay to find out . Jake , come on , let 's get out of here . Let 's go . My horse ! They took my horse . JEFFREY : What 's going on here ? Yeah . That 's what I want to know . This isn 't Hawaii . No kidding . I told you not to touch that button . What 's a Hawaii ? What were all those stars we went through ? It 's called the cosmos . Now give me the Omni ... But wait a minute . Back . Where are we ? How did we get here , and why is everybody dressed funny ? You people lost ? Bogg , we gotta get her back . I know . We gotta get us back . I know . Listen , Jackie , we 're far away from Hawaii , I think . And the only way back is for you to give us that Omni . Negative . Espionage equipment confiscated by Intelligence Personnel becomes the property of the United States Army . Section 54 , Paragraph 3 . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Well , I can 't even tell you where we are without it . Well , I can tell you where we are . You 're in Utah . Utah ? That 's crazy . Yeah , well , you think that one 's crazy . Wait till you hear the next one . What 's the date ? April 10 , 1860 . Who are you ? I 'm Bill Cody . Buffalo Bill ? Give me a break . Buffalo Bill ? Nobody ever called me that before . They will . I 'm a Pony Express rider , and I had to get this medicine to Salt Lake . See , there 's a sick little girl that won 't make it past tomorrow night without it . The Pony Express won 't survive if she doesn 't . What do you mean ? Setting up the Pony Express takes money . No backer is willing to put up his money until somebody proves it 'll work . So far every rider has failed to get through that pass . You see , the little girl 's father , he 's a banker . He knew the stage wouldn 't make it in time so he said he 'd give the company the backing it needs if we could make it . Do you expect me to believe all this ? You think I 'm lying about a sick little girl ? Never mind her . How 's your ankle ? I think it 's broke . I was the company 's last chance . I guess there 's no way I can make it now . Poor kid . We gotta help Bill make that ride . Wait a minute . Do you guys expect me to believe that he 's the Buffalo Bill Cody , and this is really 1860 ? JACKIE : What are you ? Nuts ? You got it . Okay , look , fellows , fun is fun . You say this is 1860 , I say this part of Utah looks the same in 1941 . And for all I know that guy and his friends could just be a bunch of rejects from a Hopalong Cassidy movie . Listen , Jackie , you have to understand . That device you took from us is a time machine . Time machine ? There 's no such thing . That 's what you think . And this is Utah , 1860 . And if you ever want to see Pearl Harbor , 1941 again , either give us back the Omni , or wait around 81 years and take a boat . I don 't believe any of this . Then explain how you got here . It 's some kind of espionage trick . A spell of some kind . Hypnotism or drugs . That 's it , you two have me drugged . Let 's argue about this later , okay ? You don 't mind if we get Bill here to a doctor , do you ? Okay , but no funny business . DOCTOR : Now , listen , you stay off that foot ! ( EXCLAIMS IN DISDUST ) That stuff will kill you . Tobacco , outlaws , what 's the difference ? And I don 't care what that doc says , I only need one good foot in the stirrup . Anyway , that little girl needs her medicine . It 's my responsibility to deliver it . But you 're just a boy . You have to be young and light to ride for the Pony Express , ma 'am . And I 'm not a boy . I do a man 's job . Yeah , you have to be light so you can ride with more speed . And you have to be an orphan , too . Why ? It 's dangerous work . Better off having somebody doing it that nobody cares about . That 's terrible . No , it ain 't , it 's exciting . Well , it 'll be suicide if you try to outrun those outlaws with a bad ankle . I 'll make the ride . No , wait a minute . JEFFREY : No , Bogg , I think I should make the ride . I 'm young , light and an orphan . Well , I don 't know . He 'd have the best chance . You two are forgetting something here . You 're my prisoners . Nobody is going anywhere . What kind of prisoners ? Prisoners of love . Excuse us a moment , would you ? Take your hands off of me . ( LAUGHS ) Prisoners of love . That 's a good one . Sit down ! Look , for once you 're gonna ... For once you 're gonna listen to me . Look around you , will you ? Whether you want to believe it or not , you traveled back through time . This is 1860 . But that 's insanity . Don 't talk , listen . Look , the kid and I travel back through time with that time machine you confiscated from us . And when we land in someplace where something 's wrong , we try to get things back on the right track , like now . ( SIGHS ) I believe you . I know it seems impossible but I 'm starting to believe it . Good . Then you understand why it 's so important for us to try and deliver that medicine . Yes . I understand . What are you crying about ? It 's just that I think I 'm losing my mind . ( LAUGHS ) No , you 're not . I 'm not ? No . I know it seems strange but it 'll all work out , you 'll see . Here . Thanks . You know , I 've always been a sucker for a girl in uniform . I must confess , Phineas , I like you , too . And you don 't think we 're spies anymore ? Oh , I hope not . And you 'll stop holding us prisoners and give us back the Omni . I can 't . What ? I just can 't , Phineas . Training like I 've had is hard to break . Now , I 've gotten myself into this assignment , and I 'm not gonna mess it up , now . Okay , have it your way . You 're still gonna let us make that ride though , aren 't you ? Sure , if I can go with you . ( MEN CHATTERING ) BOGG : There are the horses . You sure these are the outlaws ' horses ? Oh , yeah . The Palomino 's mine . And the others I 'd know anywhere . I knew the riders who died trying to get them through the pass . Well , what the outlaws took we can take back . Let 's go . Tell me , Phineas , what 's it like being a time traveler ? You should know , you just did it . Yeah , but this is my first time . I 'm totally disoriented . So am I , all the time . My clothes are always out of date . I act different , talk different . No matter where I go , I 'm always an outsider . Talk about being an outsider . Try being the only female intelligence operative on a military base . Even my job title may sound important , but all the men see is some little girl . My social life is non-existent . I haven 't even had a date since I started working at that base . Yeah ? Yeah . Well , try getting close to somebody when you spend one day in Rome and the next in Timbuktu or somewhere . Well , if it weren 't for the kid , I think I 'd go crazy . How old were you when you became an orphan ? I was really young . I never knew my parents . I guess it 's better that way . I was 10 . I knew my parents real well . I miss them . Well , at least you know what it 's like to be loved . Something you miss living in an orphanage . There they just wait for you to grow up so they can make room for somebody else . When Mr. Russell from the Pony Express come , said I was just what he was looking for ... That was really something . First time in my life somebody wanted me . I didn 't care how dangerous it was or how much I was getting paid . I was doing something to help somebody , and I 'd do it for nothing . Don 't worry , we 'll get past those outlaws . Not the three of you together , you won 't . The guy 's too big , and that girl , she 's too slow . But I can make it through . You got the right build , and all . What if I snuck away in the morning before they woke up ? Hey , now , you know how dangerous it is . For an orphan ? Piece of cake . Okay . Have you ever thought of quitting ? Sure , lots of times . ( SIGHS ) But I don 't know . This is what I do . It 's what I want to do . I couldn 't quit . I know what you mean . JEFFREY : Shh ! Be quiet . Now remember , keep your head down and whatever you do , don 't slow up . I 'll remember . Tell Bogg I 'll see him in Salt Lake . All right . ( HORSE NICKERING ) Yeah ! Go , boy . Where 's Jeffrey ? Well , he 's on his way to Salt Lake with the medicine . Without me ? Don 't worry , he 'll make it . I 'll make sure he does . Hey , you 're not leaving without me . Here comes another one . Let 's go ! Looks like Sam and Jake scared up another one . Bat 's breath ! Box canyon . ( HORSE NEIGHING ) Kid , you 've just reached the end of the line . Get off your horse . Hurry up ! I 'm going as fast as I can . Now we 're gonna teach you why no one ever gets through this pass . Bogg ! MAN : You two stupid or suicidal ? Boy , am I glad to see you . We 'll talk about this later . Give me the Omni . I 've got a gun , let 's take them on . These guys shoot back . Give me the Omni . MAN : What are you doing ? Posing for a family portrait ? I won 't tell anybody if you won 't . Pearl Harbor , December 7th 1941 . What a relief . Look , it 's Schofield Barracks . It 's nice to be home again . That 's what you think . I wonder what time it is . I think those church bells are for 7 : 30 mass . Bogg , that means we have less than half an hour . We 've got to find MacArthur , pronto . Come on . Hey , where do you guys think you 're going ? You 're still my prisoners . All right , Jackie , stop kidding around . I 'm not kidding . But , Jackie , I thought we ... You and I , what we 've been through ... I can 't believe ... I know , Phineas , I like you , I really do , both of you , but we 're back on base now , and I 've broken , who knows , how many regulations and ... For Pete 's sakes , if I 'm ever gonna prove anything to my father , I 've got to bring you two guys in . I can 't believe ... But I 'm sure that after we explain to him ... But there 's no time for that . Why ? Better tell her . At 7 : 55 this morning the Japanese are going to attack Pearl Harbor . That 's impossible . So is time travel . And unless we do something , MacArthur is going to be killed . Please , Jackie , you have to believe us . Where 's she going ? Wait here . If Jeffrey 's right , we should pick up some blips on the scope . Don 't worry , they 'll be there . There 's got to be something wrong . This is the biggest blip I 've ever seen . That 's what Jeff was trying to tell you . No . It 's got to be a malfunction of some kind . Yeah , or a lot of enemy planes . Well , if they are , there are two waves of them . And they are coming in from the north 57 miles , three degrees east . I 've got to alert the base . ( BUZZING ) Fort Shafter . Private Buck speaking . This is Miss Knox , Army Intelligence . I want to speak with the highest ranking officer in charge . You got him . A private is in charge ? Look , Miss Knox , it 's 7 : 45 in the morning . Everybody 's either asleep or having breakfast . But I 've spotted a mass of planes on the radar scope . I wouldn 't sweat it . We 're expecting a flight of B-17 s in from the mainland . He says they 're expecting B-17 s in . The kid says they 're Japanese . ( MACHINE BEEPS ) Listen carefully , you 've got to alert the base . The Japanese are going to attack Pearl Harbor . Is this a prank call ? I am very serious , Private . Sure , sure , I 'll jot down the information . Sayonara , honey . Hello . Hello . That stupid jerk . Now do you believe us ? I 'd be a fool not to . Look , we 're running out of time . We 've only got 10 minutes left . MacArthur and my father are meeting with the fleet captains at 0800 this morning on the main base . That 's right in the middle of the attack . Come on , let 's go ! You 're staying here . What ? Why ? Because a lot of people on that base are going to get killed , and I don 't want you to be one of them . But I ... No buts . Something happened last night between us , and I don 't want to lose that . You 're staying here where it 's safe . What about you ? What about Jeffrey ? I can watch out for the kid but I can 't watch both of you . Now I 'm locking you in here behind me . Phineas , I work for that base . I belong there . I don 't want to lose what we have either , but you can 't try to protect me . That 's been my problem my whole life . I 've spent so much time being protected that I never had a chance to prove I could take care of myself . Please , Phineas , I 've got to go . Okay , but watch yourself . Please . I can 't . I 'll be too busy watching you . Come on . Bogg ! Bogg , listen , they 're coming . Look ! I hope we don 't get to the base too late . ( MISSILE WHISTLING ) MAN 1 : What 's going on ? What 's all that noise ? MAN 2 : The artillery having target practice ? MAN 3 : Japanese planes ! Hit the deck ! ( AIR RAID ALARM BLARING ) Get down ! Get down ! Take cover ! Take cover ! Bogg , look , it 's MacArthur ! My father ! BOGG : Try and shoot down the Japanese with a.45. What 's that child doing here ? Sergeant , get that child under some cover ! Yes , sir . Bogg ... It 's okay , kid , it 's safer this way . JACK : Jackie , get out of here . This is no place for a woman . Never mind that , are you all right ? BOGG : Help me get your father out from under here . Don 't worry about me . Get the General ! He 's going to get himself killed ! We 'll get him ! Phineas , MacArthur ! No , let me go . Jackie , are you crazy ? Let the man go ! Please , Phineas . Okay . Did you see that ? Did you see what she did ? I knew it all the time . That 's my girl ! Come on , we 've got to get you out of here . Go on ! Go on ! I 'm okay , my leg 's not broken . Come on , let 's get out of here ! ( MACHINE GUNS FIRING ) Thanks again , Jack . I just wanted to tell you how impressed I was with your daughter . You know , General , she impressed me , too . I could use an intelligence operative in the Philippines . Do you think she might be interested ? Interested ? She 'd be delighted . She 's been badgering me for months to give her an important assignment . Good , good , she can start after the first of the year . By the way , where is she ? I 'd like to tell her myself . I believe she 's at the beach with Mr. Bogg , sir . Well then , you tell her , Jack . With your permission , sir , I know someone who 'd really like to tell her . Very well , Sergeant . Jack , see you . Good luck , General . ( OMNI DINGS ) BOGG : Green light . I guess it 's time for the kid and I to get back to Bill Cody . Nobody needs us here anymore . That 's not true . I need you , Phineas . You know , I 've spent so much time trying to prove I could be as good as a man , I missed a lot of life . I never let myself make mistakes , or get hurt , or fall in love . Everything 's changed now . If it makes you feel any better , the feeling 's mutual . A lot of good that does me . It 's bad enough having a sweetheart overseas , I 've got one over the rainbow . You can 't call me from another time zone . And if you ever write to me , it could take me 100 years just to get the letter . Well , that 's one tradition between a man and a woman that should never change . Yeah . Listen , things are gonna get better for you , I know it . I don 't know . You just be careful in Utah . Okay ? I will . Just got to figure a way past them outlaws . Jackie ! MacArthur wants you to go with him to the Philippines . Really ? I heard him say it myself . I told you things were gonna get better . Would you excuse us for a minute , Sergeant ? Yes , ma 'am . You know , Phineas , a motorcycle is a lot faster than a horse . Was thinking the same thing , myself . All right ! Great idea . ( CHUCKLES ) You take care of the big guy , okay ? No problem . Take care of yourself . ( SIGHS ) ( DINGS ) Phineas . I love you . We 'd better cover this thing up pretty well . If somebody finds it , they 'll either pass out or have a head start on the invention of the internal combustion engine . That ought to do it . Come on , let 's find Bill . Hey . Well , what happened ? Outlaws . They got our horses . Well , at least you didn 't get killed . But we still have the medicine , and I think we have a way to get it to Salt Lake by tonight . It 's no use . I tried and you tried , five riders been killed already . I say we just forget we ever heard of the Pony Express . I can always go back to the orphanage . No ! We can do it . And we can . Look , the kid and I found this horse , a very special horse , one that can outrun anything the outlaws have . Yeah ? Yeah . Oh , good . Can I see it ? No , it 's grazing a little ways from here . We need you to do something else . I 'll try . Get together a posse . We tried that . Outlaws just hide up in the hills . No . But this time it 's gonna work . We 're gonna draw the outlaws out of their holes long enough for you to get there with the posse . Heck , I 'll try anything . Then you can ride the rest of the way to Salt Lake . All right , I 'll have a posse together in an hour . BOGG : Any sign of outlaws ? Not yet . This might be easier than I thought . Keep your eyes open , kid . They could come out of anywhere . Now what the heck is that ? You got me . What did you put in those beans last night ? Maybe it 's some kind of train . Not without a track . It looks like it 's gotta be some kind of iron horse . Well , if it is , I 've gotta steal it . Come on . Here they come . Hang on . We got them out of hiding . Now , let 's give them a chase until the posse shows up . JAKE : That iron horse is fast . Bogg , they 're coming . Hang on , it 's going to be a rough ride . BILL : Come on , we 've got to get to them before the outlaws do . They 're catching up , Bogg . What 's that ? Let 's get them . They should be around the next bend . BOGG : Do you see the posse yet ? JEFFREY : No , we 've gotta keep on . They 'd better show up soon . Uh-oh , more company . What 're we gonna do ? Hang on . MAN 1 : Get them ! Get them ! BOGG : I think we 're gonna lose them . MAN 2 : That 's the darndest machine I 've ever seen . ( ENGINE FALTERING ) JEFFREY : Bogg , what 's wrong ? There 's something else that 1860 doesn 't have besides motorcycles . BOTH : Gasoline . Take off the cap and look in the tank . Bogg , look ! It 's too dark in there . I can 't see anything . Bogg , we 're going over a cliff . Jump ! ( GRUNTING ) ( CRASHING ) JEFFREY : That was close . Yeah , and there goes modern transportation . ( SIGHS ) Where 's that iron horse ? Down there . Dad gum it ! I wanted to steal that thing . Hand over your cargo . It 's just medicine . It 's no use to you . It 's gotta be worth something for you to go through all this trouble . Now , hand it over , now ! ( GUN FIRES ) Put your hands up . It 's the last time you boys are gonna block this pass . ( GROANS ) BOGG : Sure glad to see you . Well , you did it , but how ? Where 's that horse you was talking about ? Where she belongs . Someplace it will take her 80 years to come back from . What ? You never mind that . You 've still got a ride to finish . Seeing Mr. Barley 's face when the doc told him his little girl was gonna make it , made all the trouble we went through worth it . Yeah , and the Pony Express came through . Mr. Barley came through , too . This here 's a letter of credit from his bank . It 's enough money to buy the Pony Express everything it needs to get started . I gotta ride back to Missouri right away to deliver it . You fellows want to come along ? No thanks , we 've got things we got to do . I was meaning to ask you , what happened to that girl you all was with ? Oh , she had to go back to where she belongs . That 's too bad . She had something , you know , something real different . Anyway , I gotta go . Thanks again . So long . ( DINGS ) BOGG : What are you doing ? December 31 , 1941 , Hawaii . Hawaii ? Yeah . Yeah , I thought Jackie might need a date for New Year 's Eve . That 's real nice . I 'm gonna show Jackie the most exciting evening she 's ever had in her life . No way , Bogg , two 's company , but three 's a crowd . What are you talking about ? I 'm taking Jackie out New Year 's Eve . What ? Got you ! JEFFREY ... If you wanna learn more about Pearl Harbor or the Pony Express , take a voyage down to your public library . It 's all in books ! Ice ! Dead ahead ! The Titanic 's going to sink ? My , you do have an imagination . Over 1,000 people are going to die . We can stop it . We can make it so it never happened . It 's a terrible tragedy , but it 's going to happen . We can 't change that . I can 't let that happen . I can 't . Iceberg ! Oh , my God ! We 're going to hit ! Collision ! Collision ! BOGG ... We travel through time to help history along , give it a push where it 's needed . Bogg ! BOGG ... When the Omni 's red , it means history 's wrong . Our job 's to get everything back on track . ( OMNI DINGS ) Green light , kid ! We did it ! ( BOTH GRUNT ) It 's a cinch that you 'd never make an aircraft carrier pilot . Quit complaining , will you ? We hit the deck , didn 't we ? That 's exactly what we did , hit it . Hard . Where are we , anyway ? On a very big boat . ( BEEPING ) In the middle of the Atlantic . April 14 , 1912 . Date ring a bell ? No . ( WOMEN LAUGHING ) Well , wherever we are , this time we 're traveling first class . Come on . Wow ! They sure don 't build them like this anymore . They certainly don 't . Hmm ! Bogg ... I 've got a feeling I 'm going to like this job . Well , hello there . You must be from some uncivilized part of this world . Oh , yeah , sorry . I guess these clothes aren 't exactly proper . They 're perfect . You see , I 've had it up to here with civilization . Suzanne Brandes . Phineas Bogg . Hi . Bogg . Bogg ! Excuse me . It 's my nephew . Look , this is going to take a little research . Why don 't you take a stroll around the deck or something ? I 'll check things out here . Bogg . Titanic ? That 's the big one that went down , huh ? Maybe on another trip ? It sank on its first trip . Right . Listen , Suzanne , why don 't you go to your cabin , get a nice warm coat and meet me up on deck in , say , 20 minutes ? Hmm , I 'm on my way . Okay . Oh , and bring your life preserver . Okay , the first thing we have to do is find out how much time we have . Are you crazy ? We 've got to stop this ship ! Jeffrey , look ... Over 1,000 people are going to die . We can stop it . We can make it so it never happened . That 's not what 's wrong . How can you say that ? I know it 's hard to understand , but sometimes history 's cruel . There 's wars , disasters , injustices , but some of those things , no matter how much you want them not to happen , are supposed to happen . But the Titanic ... It 's a terrible tragedy , but it 's going to happen . It was in my guidebook , you learned it in school , we can 't change that , but we can find out why the Omni 's red . Maybe someone 's on board that isn 't supposed to be . Maybe we can save somebody important before it goes down . No ! We can save them all ! No , we can 't . People are going to lose their families . Their parents . You don 't know what it 's like to lose your mom and your dad . No ! I can 't let that happen . I can 't . Jeff ! I 'm terribly sorry , but steerage class passengers are not permitted on the upper decks . I 'll have someone escort you below . Look , I 'm just going after the boy . I 'll be right back . I 'll get the boy . You 're not going anywhere dressed like that . Now calm down , Mr. Ismay . Why , if he can afford that doodad he 's wearing on his belt , he must be traveling first class . You let him find his boy . I 'm sorry , Mrs. Brown , but as I 've reminded you before , dress codes on the Titanic are unimpeachable . I 'm sure you 'll understand . No point in hitting him . I 've tried . If you 'll excuse me ... What a pain . Who is that guy ? That 's Bruce Ismay . He 's General Director of these floating hotels . Why , you must have met him at the bon voyage party . Actually , I just dropped in at the last minute . Oh , well , then you 're lucky . My name is Molly Brown . Phineas Bogg . Well , it 's a real pleasure to meet somebody who isn 't all stuffy and stuck up . You know , Ismay isn 't stopping me because of any dress code . So why don 't I go find your boy . What did you say his name is ? Jeffrey . I think he was headed for the bridge . Where else ? I 'll bring him back . Molly , you said you 'd seen one of these before ? Seen it ? Haggerty 's had it under the nose of practically everybody on board . Haggerty ? Haggerty . The walrus with the mustache that sold it to you . How much did you pay for that ? I know , I know , I know . It 's rude to ask . But he was asking a pretty penny for a gizmo that don 't even tell the time . What did he tell you that is ? Well , you know , I wanted to talk to him more about that . You know where he is ? Usually he holes up in his room . Let 's see , that 's a deck below this one , room next to mine . I think it 's called the Edinburgh Suite . Right . Thanks . Oh , Phineas ! Phineas . Now , Phineas , I know that you feel real comfortable in these clothes , but these folks , they just don 't understand . So why don 't you put on a coat and a tie ? Let me go ! Come on ! No ! Let me go ! I 'll let you go when we find your father . But I 've got to see the Captain . The Captain 's busy . But it 's a matter of life and death ! Oh , stop it . And don 't you be such a crab , Mr. Ismay . Why , seeing the Captain could be a matter of life and death to a young boy . It would 've been for me when I was his age . It 's really important . I 've really got to see him . You know , I was just thinking how much I 'd like to see that bridge . Well , I 'm sure something could be arranged . Right now , Mr. Ismay . With this boy . It would be my pleasure . Can 't seem to find my way around the ship . Keep ending up in the laundry . There you are ! We must have just missed on deck . Were you corning down here to look for me ? Oh ! Gorgeous ! Actually , I was just heading up this way . You know , let 's just forget the deck . My room 's right down the hall . We could have a little supper . No , no , no , it has to be the deck . With my life preserver ? Oh , yeah . That 's the best part . Oh ! Anything you say . Now , why don 't you go right on up and I 'll be right there . I 'm on my way , sugar . ( MUFFLED SCREAMING ) ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) ( SHUSHING ) Just a moment . Yes ? Who is it ? BOGG : Mr. Haggerty ? Yes , this is Mr. Haggerty . Molly Brown sent me down to talk to you . Brown ? She said you 'd have a device that resembles this one . Please come in . Thanks . Be seated . The Titanic 's going to sink ? My , you do have an imagination . It 's not my imagination . You 're going to hit an iceberg tonight . The closest iceberg is over 250 miles to the north . And even if we did bump into one , the Titanic would hardly go down . Why won 't you listen ? People are going to die . You can stop it . I think that 's quite enough . The boy has seen the Captain . Jeffrey ... No , you 've got to believe me . Come along , young man . Come on , Jeffrey , it 's best . No ! You 're all so stupid . So dumb . MOLLY : Come on , Jeffrey . It 's a dark night . Post extra seamen on watch . It 's odd , Mr. Bogg . Odd ? Yes . That I 've not seen you before . It 's a very large ship . Yes , but not that big . And , quite frankly , I find it extraordinary that two people aboard the Titanic should have such a rare device . Which is why I couldn 't pass up the opportunity to come and see you . I 'd like to buy yours . Start a collection . And how much is it worth to you , Mr. Bogg ? That would depend on its condition . May I see it ? It 's identical to yours . Where 'd you get it ? I was just wondering when you 'd get to that . ( WOMAN MOANING ) Remove the sack . ( MUFFLED SCREAMING ) I assume you know her . If not , get acquainted . You 'll be joining her tonight for a midnight swim . You really believe it 's going to happen , don 't you ? It 's out there . Why won 't they listen ? You know , my daddy used to say to me , " Molly , children ought to be seen , not heard . " My eyes are open , " but my ears are closed . " I guess that has something to do with why I 'm such a noisy person today . You 're Molly Brown . Yep , for better or for worse . The Molly Brown who owned all the silver mines . The Unsinkable Molly Brown ! Unsinkable ? Well , considering the circumstances , I should hope so . Come on , I said we 'd meet your daddy near the salon . ( BELL CLANGING ) Ice ! Dead ahead ! Jeffrey ! Dead ahead ? Huh ? God help us . Hard astarboard ! Oh , my God ! We 're going to hit ! It 's drifting starboard . Hard aport ! Hard over ! Hard over there ! Turn ! Turn ! Splendid evening . Yes , yes , just lovely . Now , Mr. Bogg , your device . I feel that two will bring a fancy price . We 're going to collide ! No ! ( GRUNTS ) Collision ! Collision ! ( CRASHING ) Come on . Come on ! Get after them ! Get after them ! Help me a little bit , will you ? We 're going this way ! I 'm not going to argue with you . I 'm sure it was nothing . Nothing at all to be concerned about . Strike up a tune . Something zippy . Why in all the time zones in all the world do I have to land in one with you in it ? Phineas Bogg , you idiot ! Good to see you , too , Olivia . We 've got to go back . Are you crazy ? Come on ! It 's back there ! So are they , come on . Right there ! The Captain 's on his way up . I want a damage report before he gets here . Forget it ! The ship 's going down ! We 've got to save the people . What 's he doing here ? Get him out ! Jeffrey ... No ! You 've got to get the lifeboats . You 've got to hurry . Jeffrey , you 're not helping . You can let him go . I 'll take it from here . Jeffrey ... Jeffrey , now you listen to me . Now , nothing that you say is going to make them listen . I don 't know how , but you were right about the iceberg and you have certainly got my attention . Now , Jeffrey , if this boat 's going down , there are two things we have got to do . We have got to calmly warn the passengers . And find your father . Right ? ( BAND PLAYING UPBEAT TUNE ) Phineas , we 've gotta go back and get it ! Get what ? The Mona Lisa ! Who ? Stop that man ! Stop that woman ! They robbed me ! Stop that man ! Stop that woman ! ( ALL MURMURING ) ( EXCLAIMS ) I left Bogg in a big salon down here somewhere . We 'll find him all right , honey . The Mona Lisa ! She 's down in Haggerty 's room ? Yes . That 's what 's wrong ! We 've got to go back ! JEFFREY : Bogg ! Jeff ! The boat 's going down ! They wouldn 't listen ! Who 's the kid ? We 're sinking , Phineas . There they are ! Haggerty , what is this all about ? Phineas ! There you are ! Hang on , kid . What in blue blazes ? What is going on here ? Oh , no ! Stop , thief ! Stop ! Stop ! You must get back in your cage . Stop ! Don 't run ! You are sick . Please let me try to help you . ( BARKING ) Don 't be afraid . I 'm not going to hurt you . ( PLUMMETING ) ( GROANS ) Sorry if we scared you , it 's just that we ... ( DOG GROWLING ) Uh-oh . Watch it , kid . What in the name of ... What is going on here ? ( BEEPING ) 1884 , France . We got a red light . Beware , the dog is mad . Well , that must be what 's wrong . Why don 't we catch the dog and get out of here ? Wait a minute , you heard what he said . That 's a mad dog . That 's right , I forgot . You 've always been afraid of dogs . I 'm not afraid of dogs . Bogg . I 'm just cautious . Very cautious . There 's no need to apologize , Phineas . You just stay out of the way and I will take care of this . Please , get out of here . This dog is very dangerous . He has rabies . I can help you get him . No , it is too dangerous . If he bites you , you will have the disease . What is the disturbance ? Careful . The dog . OLIVIA : Come on , boy . Nobody 's going to hurt you . We need a net . Yeah , but we don 't have one . Don 't corner him . Phineas , you 're the wrong person to be giving me advice about dogs . Easy , fellow . Easy , boy . Down ! Down ! Olivia , don 't ! Olivia , stop it ! Here boy ! Leave him alone ! Please , you do not understand how dangerous he is . You will only aggravate him . Olivia , listen to him ! Olivia , I told you not to corner him . Down . Olivia , no ! Look out , kid ! Quickly , put him in the bag . I 'll take that . You and the dog have already caused lots of trouble . This time , I am going to call the doctor . The real doctor . Listen , time is of the essence ! We must treat the boy immediately . I 'll be right here . No , don 't leave me ! Be quiet . Bogg , I want you to take me back . What about Jeffrey ? Well , you can come right back . Besides , I don 't need you now , any more than I did on the ship . Bogg , you had no right to interfere with my assignment ! Now I want you to take me back , right now ! Interfere with your assignment ? Bogg , who is she ? The most stubborn , headstrong , egotistical ... Dunn , Olivia . Voyager , class of ' 97 . A voyager ? How come you never told me about her , Bogg ? I 've been trying to forget I ever knew her . Since when do you want to forget a pretty blonde ? Since I was voted Voyager Most Likely to Succeed . I must get more antiseptic . Now , you are not to move , understand ? Well , you weren 't living up to your title back there . Just what were you doing on the Titanic , anyway ? I was doing my job . Trying to rescue the Mona Lisa . Who 's she ? The Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci . It 's the most famous painting in the world . Oh . Did that go down on the Titanic ? It 's supposed to be in the Louvre in France . Only , I think it was stolen once . By Vincenzo Perugia , an Italian who used to work at the Louvre . He felt that this piece ought to be back in Italy where it was painted . So he stole it and hid it in his basement where he felt it belonged until things calmed down . What does that have to do with the Titanic ? Because those two gents you met on the ship stole it from Vincenzo . And smuggled it on the Titanic ? Yeah , but I got to the dock too late to stop them . So you stow away onboard ship . Well , I had to finish my assignment . And I was doing just fine until you showed up . I knew you resented me , but to sabotage my mission ... Sabotage your mission ? You weren 't doing so hot when I got there , you know . It was a temporary setback ! Being thrown overboard with your hands tied would not have been temporary . I had a plan . They had your Omni . ( EXCLAIMS ) Jeffrey , it doesn 't look too serious . You 'll be okay . The skin is broken . The dog had rabies , didn 't it ? Yes . In here , Doctor ! There ! There 's the boy . He was bitten . So , this is your doing , Pasteur . You may be a hero in Paris where the safety of their wines and milk is more important than the safety of their children , but not here . Take him carefully . We 'll go to my office . You can 't let him take Jeffrey . He 's a doctor . Bogg , if you 'd paid attention in class , you 'd know that this is Dr. Louis Pasteur . He discovered the cure for rabies . Wait ... Wait a minute . No , let him take the boy . He will get plenty of rest at Dr. Bernard 's . But I don 't want to go . Go ahead , don 't worry . I 'll take care of it , I promise . I promise . Dr. Pasteur , you do have a serum ? Yes , I have been working on a treatment for rabies . Then your serum does work ? I have had some success with the animals . But the last animal did not respond to the injections . Perhaps it would be unwise to try it on the boy . Dr. Bernard may be right . I am only a chemist . No , to try it on a child would be too great a risk . Look , wait a minute ... Can 't we ... Can 't we Omni forward a few years , get the serum and come right back ? Olivia , if Pasteur doesn 't have the confidence to perfect that serum , a cure for rabies isn 't going to happen at all . We have a red light here and now . Doctor Pasteur , you 've got to try that serum on Jeffrey . It 'll work , I know it . Besides , it 's his only chance . Perhaps . I have it here . Come on , let 's go get Jeffrey . Not so fast , Olivia . Don 't make me pull rank on you . We 're both voyagers . Oh , no ! PASTEUR : Perhaps this is all for the best . What ? My work on this rabies serum has been cursed with one misadventure after another . I cannot go on . You have to . I must abandon this research before I become the laughingstock of all Paris . I could not live with that . If Jeffrey dies because you were afraid to risk your reputation , how will you live with that ? You are right . I 'm afraid that all my success has made me a coward . Then you 'll test the serum on Jeffrey ? Yes , if I could . Well , can 't you just make more vaccine ? It would take a month to get the equipment from the laboratory in Paris . Well , then we 'll just get it back together and quick . What do you need ? Flasks , a burner ... It took half a year to get that burner from England . Jeffrey doesn 't have six months . Look , the stuff won 't be state of the art , but we 'll make do . Stuff ? Where do you think you 're going ? And you always prided yourself on being able to think on your feet . I 'm going on a scavenger hunt . The only thing that might save me is Dr. Pasteur 's vaccine . Pasteur is not a doctor . Not like you , but he 's a great chemist . His theories are nothing but hypothetical mumbo jumbo . His theories are going to change medicine someday . It took generations for doctors to gain the respect and trust of their patients . And now Pasteur comes up with this hocus-pocus of injecting his people with rabies . ( EXCLAIMS ) But it 's the only thing that might work . No , I can 't allow him to give you this injection of vaccine anymore than I would watch you swallow a whole bottle of poison . Sorry it took so long . Well , what do you have ? Jars , dishes , and a cup . And these will work as flasks , won 't they ? That 's okay . Louis says we got plenty right here . Swell . Yes , Mr. Bogg found some empty wine bottles and had the wonderful sense to break off the tops . Simple , but functional . Also , we managed to assemble another burner . We 've been very busy . I can see that . Let 's get on with mixing up another batch of this vaccine . Hey , wait a minute . You got to sterilize those things . They 're perfectly clean . I washed them with my own two hands . In boiling water ? How am I supposed to stick my hands in boiling water ? Yes , boiling water will kill all the microorganisms . A very bright young lady , indeed . BERNARD : There , now , get some rest . No . No , please , Dr. Bernard . You 're a good doctor , but there are just some things you don 't understand yet . Now save your strength . You 're going to need all of it later , son . No ! No , no ... I 'm not going to sit here and die . I want to go back to Dr. Pasteur 's lab . I want to go back to Bogg . No , back in the bed . Bogg . Let 's get some rest . Sleep . There now . You go to sleep . Bogg . Sleep . Sleep now . Bogg . How much longer is this going to take ? This process cannot be rushed . Yeah , we want it right . Getting the vaccine right isn 't going to help anybody if we don 't get to Jeffrey pretty quick . You don 't have to remind me how much is riding on this . Well , you seem to have forgotten about the Titanic easily enough . I haven 't forgotten anything ! We have got to get back there , Bogg ! There 's nothing we can do till the vaccine 's ready . Why can 't we get Jeffrey and bring him here ? No . We 're going to bring the vaccine to him . But we 're wasting time . We 've got a lot better chance of getting in with a vial than we do of sneaking Jeffrey out . What are you so afraid of ? I 'm not afraid of anything . It 's just a lot better if we wait and go in there together with Dr. Pasteur . Yeah , no one will notice the parade passing through . Please , I cannot concentrate with all this bickering . Sorry . We 're all very concerned about Jeffrey . Yeah . Are you not going after your young lady ? She 's not my young lady . You fight as if she were . ( BELL TOLLING ) Jeffrey ? Jeffrey ? Jeffrey . Bogg . Take me to Bogg . Oh , Jeffrey , I 'm going to take you to him right now . What are you doing here ? It is ready . Great . Olivia ... Olivia ! Where is the young lady ? She must help us to get to the boy . I have a lousy hunch she 's already on her way . Come on . Take her away . I don 't want Pasteur or the man disturbing this child . My men are on guard . No one will get past them . Bogg . Well , I guess we were right . Once you arrived , we knew you two would not be far behind . Now you 'll be spending a few nights in our jail . Good job . You and your stupid heroics might just have cost Jeffrey his life . We must get the serum to the boy . You ever play football ? Football ? Forget it . Just follow my lead . Listen ... Pasteur , I am the boy 's physician , I will not let you do this . Sorry , Doc , but I think we need a second opinion . Go ahead . Don 't be a fool , Pasteur . If the boy dies , you will be disgraced , ruined ! Dr. Bernard , I shall have them all arrested . Do with me what you will . My work is done now . Let us wait and see . You sure you 're strong enough to leave ? Yeah , I feel great . Honest . All right . Thanks for saving Jeffrey 's life . Yeah . I thank you . Without your help , the vaccine might not have had its test . Thank God it did . It seems that I was the fool . I , too , had my doubts . Only this man had faith in the serum . My faith was in you , Dr. Pasteur . We must rebuild your laboratory . Only bigger and better . Please , Dr. Pasteur , let me help you with your work . Yes , yes , that would be fine . ( DINGS ) We got a green light . Great . Now can we get back to the Titanic ? Yep . Where 's Olivia ? She 's out there somewhere . What are you doing sitting out here ? I didn 't ... I didn 't have the guts to face you guys . It 's a green light . OLIVIA : Yeah . No thanks to me . I 'm really sorry , Jeffrey . I 'm okay . Yeah , the kid 's in one piece . Next job , rescue the Mona Lisa off the Titanic . Yeah , and get your Omni and Guidebook back . Yeah , well , let 's get on with it . The sooner we get it done , the sooner I can quit . You can 't quit . First I louse up the Mona Lisa rescue , and then I nearly kill Jeffrey by letting that dog get past me . It wasn 't your fault . You said it , Bogg . Me and my stupid heroics . I am one lousy voyager . I didn 't mean ... No , you were right . I 'm not worthy to carry that Omni . When this is over , I 'm going to walk into Voyager Headquarters and resign . You win , Phineas . You win . Come on . Let 's get out of here . ( BAND PLAYING MOURNFUL ) Come on , let 's find the Mona Lisa . Captain Smith . If only I had listened . ( GUN FIRING ) ( PEOPLE SCREAMING ) Everybody stand back ! Can 't allow any men on this lifeboat . Women and children only ! Save your breath , Murdoch ! The Mona Lisa ! HAGGERTY : I 'm not in the mood for this chivalry nonsense . Come on . Come on ! Come on , we got to help . BOGG : Hey , Haggerty ! Haggerty , stop ! JEFFREY : Bogg ! He 's getting away ! Start up there and work your way forward . I 'll try to flush him toward you . I 'd mess it up , Bogg . I 'd only slow you down . Olivia , all you have to ... Just go without me . Please . I 'll meet you and Jeff at the Louvre tomorrow . I 'm going with you . Forget it . You 're staying here with her . But how will you get there ? Haggerty 's got your Omni . JEFFREY : Bogg ! See you in Paris , kid ! We can 't just leave him here ! The boat 's going down ! Jeffrey ... What kind of voyager are you ? I just can 't . Well , I can . Jeffrey ! SEAMAN : Keep moving , please . Just keep moving . Right down the steps and to your right . Follow the seaman . Right , straight down . No pushing . There 's plenty of room . Ho , ho , ho ! Where are you going ? No , I can 't ! Mrs. Brown ! Isn 't this boy with you ? Jeffrey ! Jeffrey ! Oh , thank God . Bring him down here , sailor , please . No , I can 't . Just be glad you 're not a man , son . No ! No ! Let me go ! ( SINGING NEARER , MY GOD , TO THEE ) Excuse me , ma 'am . Ismay ! The dress codes of the Titanic are unimpeachable , huh ? This hat isn 't you at all . Let me go ! No ! Come on , Jeffrey , there 's nothing you can do back there , Jeffrey . Let me go ! No ! Bogg 's back there . I 've got to go back and help him . Jeffrey , there is nothing you can do back there , honey . Come on , ma 'am , hurry into the boat . Give this to the boy . It belonged to his father . There 's room for just one more . Just one more . Lower away . Bogg ! No ! No ! Bogg ! I got to get back to Bogg . No ! Bogg ! ( SINGING NEARER , MY GOD , TO THEE ) ( PANTING ) Over to the left . There 's one . There ! Hand him your oar . You can 't put anyone else in this boat , it 'll sink . Ismay ! Hand him your oar , or you 're going to trade places . Pull up there , Jeffrey . Where 's the device ? Where is it ? In my right vest pocket . ( SCREAMS ) What the heck do you think you 're doing ? I had him right where I wanted him . Oh , yeah . Yeah , but you had to fly in and play hero again . Why , you ingrate . If it weren 't for me ... If it weren 't for you , I 'd have everything under control . Oh , yeah ? Yeah ! Welcome back . Thanks . Now , where 's the painting ? Over there . Did Haggerty have the Omni ? No , it 's down there . Come on ! Son , in all the excitement I almost forgot . A woman gave me this . Said it was your father 's . Thanks . ( BEEPING ) Come on , Bogg . It 's down there . Bogg , you can 't do that ! Bogg , you can 't . It 's too hot ! And the ocean 's too cold . There 's another man in the water over there . We can 't put anyone else on this boat , it 'll sink . This time the coward 's right . The water is almost over the edge . Pick him up . But they said ... Pick him up . Row over there to the right ! You better be there , Bogg . You better be there . Jeffrey ? Jeffrey ! Give me your hand ! Bogg , we 're going under ! I hope it still works . ( MAN SHOUTING IN FRENCH ) ( BELL TOLLING ) ( SOBBING ) ( LAUGHING ) Hey ! Bonjour , kid . Bogg ! Hey ! I mean ... I thought ... I mean , I saw the ship go down ... Yeah , believe me , it was close . It was close . Did you get the painting ? We got the Mona Lisa , and she 's safely in Vincenzo 's basement . That 's why we 're a little late . Why didn 't you put it back in the museum ? Because the Mona Lisa stays in Vincenzo Perugia 's basement for one more year . At which time he tries to sell it to Italy , is apprehended ... And the painting 's returned to the Louvre . You got it , kid . Boy , that Guidebook sure comes in handy . Yeah . And since Olivia 's going to quit , she won 't mind if we take hers . Who is quitting ? Well , you said before you were going to quit and ... And leave history in the hands of guys like you ? What 's the matter with guys like us ? Nothing . ( OLIVIA MOANING ) Thanks , Phineas . See ya ? Yeah . See ya . Some voyager . ( SIGHS ) Some lady . Come on . JEFFREY ... If you want to learn more about the Titanic or Louis Pasteur , take a voyage down to your public library . It 's all in books ! Done by ( c ) dcd / January 2008

 He 's right on my tail . I can 't shake this guy . This American helicopter is fast , but not fast enough . Let 's see you match this . Achieving targeting position . Moving in for the kill . I have you now . Direct hit ! Let 's pick up Mike . What kept you ? Feels as if I 've been waiting for an hour . That 's a hell of a machine . How does it handle ? Like a dream . I 'm just glad it wasn 't the real thing . Me , too . Anytime you need your tail waxed a little , just let me know , will you ? Let 's just hope that the East Germans haven 't made any modifications . LOCKE : We can 't afford any complications . Let 's check the drill . We 've only got ten days to go . Yeah , let 's just hope the rest of the operation goes as smooth as that flight . Well , you sure gave Airwolf a lesson in humility . Pity the cowboy who blames his horse . All right , let 's go over this one more time . MIKE : Give me a break , will you ? Step one . Herzfeld arrives at the air show hangar and goes through security . Two . He goes to the empty locker room and uh ... Makes sure he 's got no company . LOCKE : Three . Three , Santa comes down the chimney and Herzfeld takes the tunnel to the North Pole . LOCKE : Four . Saint John maintains visual contact with Mike . I debrief Herzfeld . LOCKE : Five . I take the plane up and entertain the crowds until ... LOCKE : Six . MIKE : Six . We get the information , and Herzfeld leaves . And seven ? Seven , I come home . We say goodbye and that 's it . Seems simple enough to me . An agent as deeply planted as Herzfeld is inaccessible for years at a time . He 's gonna be really closely watched . Yeah , I know , I know . If he sneezes he 'll have twenty red handkerchiefs coming out of his nose . Our timing is crucial . We have no margin for error . And we 've got three days to perfect the plan . How 's your German coming ? ( SPEAKING GERMAN ) What the hell is that supposed to mean ? He says he doesn 't know . He hasn 't slept in a week and he 's tired . We have to leave tonight . What ? Tonight ? Say you 're kidding . Say that 's it a joke , huh ? There 's been a change of schedule . Herzfeld flies at the beginning of the air show now instead of the end . JO : That 's really pushing it , Saint John . Mike , do you think you can do it ? He hasn 't been over the wall in two years , right ? SAINT JOHN : Right . Right . He knows the name of our mole , right ? Right . It 's now or never , right ? Well , it strikes me as if we don 't have too much choice . Just do me one favor , will you ? Don 't screw it up . I mean I really don 't feel like spending the rest of my days behind the Iron Curtain . There 's something missing . That 's better . If I lose this , I 'm in deep trouble . Well , losing a week of prep time has made things a lot more tense . But you can pull it off , Mike . Pull it off ? I just glued that damn thing on . All right , we 've planted one of these for you in the locker room . It 's got the same com-link as our Airwolf helmets . Something familiar , thank God . Let 's just pray Herzfeld hasn 't suddenly shaved in the last twenty-four hours . LOCKE : That glue holds for a week . SAINT JOHN : Yeah . Close enough . " Good luck " would have been just fine . Thanks , Saint John . Sorry . Good luck . And remember , we 'll be listening to you the whole time you 're up there . You 'll be fine , Mike . I know you will . Well , Captain Klaus Herzfeld , are you ready ? ( SIGHS ) ( SPEAKS GERMAN ) ( SPEAKS GERMAN ) Paris would seem to offer you the perfect opportunity today , for your particular talents , huh ? ( SPEAKS GERMAN ) Danke sehr , I am flattered . Tell me , how does it feel to be selected representative of the German Democratic Republic at this International Exhibition ? This is a great honor , naturlich , as is your unexpected presence . Surely , Doctor , you didn 't come just to see me fly . As a matter of fact , Captain , I came to watch you land . Safely . Paris is such a romantic city , I thought you could use a reward for your efforts here today . Strauss , present the Captain with his surprise . Klaus . Katharina . You should not have come . I 'm sure you and your lovely wife will have much to talk about , after your flight . When you have changed into your equipment , we will be privileged to escort you to your aircraft . Check the locker room . Excuse me , but I 'm useless with motors . Could you help me , please ? Sure thing . What seems to be the ... Take his clothes . I have a Christmas present for Santa Claus . Milk and cookies . We better hurry , we 're running behind schedule . No . It is too late . They already suspect I am a double agent . What do you mean ? They have taken my wife , Katharina , as hostage . I will not risk her life ! You are mistaken . My husband would never defect to the West ! He has the look of a nervous rabbit about to run . My husband runs from nothing ! And you are our insurance to ensure that he doesn 't . Let us hope , for both our sakes that you know your husband well . Strauss ? Go and find out what is keeping Captain Herzfeld . What 's going on ? But where is ... The weather 's cleared up . We 're late . Let 's get on with it . For luck . A husband needs the assurances of his wife . For luck , mein Lieber . Come , come . He 's headed out to the tarmac now but there 's a hitch . He 's got a woman along for the party . It 's his wife . His wife ! Does she know he 's working with us ? No . She knows nothing . Will she blow Mike 's cover ? I don 't know . She slips up and it 's game over for all of us . What 's happening up there , Saint John ? SAINT JOHN : The limo stopped near the plane , but nobody 's getting out . You seem unusually nervous Frau Herzfeld . She worries about me . Yes , it 's true . Well , don 't worry , Captain Herzfeld . Your wife will be here , safely with me . He 's headed to the plane . He 's either got her fooled , or she 's playing along . SAINT JOHN : We 're all right as long as the weather holds up . Keep a tight watch , Saint John . SAINT JOHN : He 's climbing in the cockpit . He 's in . Here we go . Can you read me ? Position one , reading you . We hear you , Mike . Hey , wait a minute . This instrument panel is completely different from the one we worked on . German , Mike . Think German , man . Okay , I got it . Here we go . Okay , Klaus , let 's get started . We 've lost minutes already . With the information I 've already gathered , we should be able to identify who your mole is . Thanks . Mike , we need the full 30 minutes . Stay up as long as you can . This is the easy part . I hope everyone 's enjoying the show . He 's scheduled for 30 minutes . Then we move . Let 's move . This is incredible . One man has already died to get this footage . That missile 's a copy all right . They might as well paint stars and stripes all over it . I can 't believe the extent of the leak . This must have been going on for years . In the shot coming up you 'll see Kenderson . Freeze frame it , Jo . KLAUS : Alfred Kenderson . Became KGB in 1982 . He has served on three international trade commissions . He is free to travel wherever and whenever he pleases . Washington is in for a big surprise . And so is Kenderson ! Let 's nail him . I 'll patch this through to central data base . It 's gonna take a while . Nice work , Herzfeld . This is a bigger payoff than we hoped for . Not much longer and you 'll be back with your wife . I hope so . Saint John , we 're almost done . And it 's a big one ! Looking good so far . Mike ? Okay , in that case , catch this action , Saint John , buddy . This should turn you green with envy . That is unnecessary arrogance . A simple demonstration is all that 's required . He really can fly , can 't he ? ( ALARM BEEPING ) What the hell ? Can 't get out . Can 't pull back . Oh , no . Herzfeld . Assist ! Emergency assist ! Listen carefully . Hit the emergency stabilizer switch , on the left side of the panel . MIKE : Now you tell me . We 've modified the aircraft . KLAUS : It 's an electronic back-up in the case of a dive . He 's got it . It 's under control . Oh , man , that was some elevator ride ! MIKE : Can I bring her down ? Yeah , we 're done , Mike . Nice work . Come on down . Thanks . We were lucky . Washington confirms receipt of data . I can feel the shock waves already . Let 's get ready to make the exchange . Saint John , let me know the minute Mike comes down . Just touching down now . Let her go . Where is my husband ? He is safe . Just keep quiet . You did well . Congratulations , Captain ! That was a spectacular display ! Go ! Hurry ! ( GUNFIRE ) Wild card ! Wild card ! We 've got heavy gunfire . Somebody just grabbed Mike and the woman . They 're in a gray van . I repeat , they 've got Mike . What the hell is going on ? ( PEOPLE SCREAMING ) Locke ! Fire up Airwolf ! Saint John and I will try and follow from the air . Jo , you and Klaus commandeer a vehicle and catch up on the ground . Right . Klaus ! You have any idea who might want to kidnap you or your wife ? No . ( YELLING IN FRENCH ) It 's okay . It 'll be okay . These people don 't want to hurt you . It 's me they 're after . Right ? Right . Who is the woman ? You have the wrong people ! He 's not who you think ! What did you mean by that ? You are Hauptmann Herzfeld ! Yes , of course . She is only trying to protect me . I was a fool to bring his wife . Now both of them will try to defect . Just get me close enough for one clean shot . I want Herzfeld alive . Dead , he is a martyr . Alive he is a failure and an example . Let her go . She is of no use to you . Let her go and I will cooperate , whatever it is you want . Huh . We are releasing no one . What is it that you do want ? How could this have happened ? There was to be security from two sides ! Look , nobody could have foreseen this . Now think , who 'd want to kidnap you ? I ask you , what good will a guessing game do at this point ? For one thing , it 'll let me concentrate on the road . I 'm sorry . I see only Katharina 's face . Please , God , keep her safe . Anything coming up yet ? No . Come on , come on . Yes ! Here we go . He hung on to his helmet . Atta boy , Mike . South by south west . Heading away from Paris . They 're about six kilometers ahead of us . Whoever the hell " they " are . Good question . We 're heading into the country , away from Paris . I want to know what is going on ! I want to know where we 're going . The road is only lined by trees . Shut up ! Give me your helmet now ! They discovered the microphone . ELAN : I have never seen a helmet like this . What is this ? It 's standard issue . Stop ! ( GRUNTS ) Omar said he was not to be harmed . He must be able to fly . He was broadcasting our position . They 've stopped . Try and locate the helmet . Someone is following us . Slow down . Don 't make a mistake . Herzfeld is too important . Cripple the vehicle . Throw it now ! A grenade ! The car is waiting around the next corner . Slow down or you will miss it . Hessler is dead . We 're gonna follow the van . Be careful . We 'll sweep ahead of you . Get out . ACHMED : Move ! Move ! Come on ! ( EXCLAIMS ) See anything yet , Jo ? No . Nothing . Well , they 've got this place sealed up like a tomb . I 'm so sorry . I can 't help it . I 'm so scared . Yeah , me , too . In case you haven 't figured it out yet , your husband is working with us . I suspected something like this . He 's been different . Yeah . Well spying does work hell with your home life . You are like him , you know . That 's the idea . No , I don 't mean the looks . You are like he used to be . Full of life . What 's with the scarf ? Oh , that is a tradition between us . It 's sort of a good luck charm . Really foolish . No . No , it 's romantic . He 's lucky to have someone like you . How can you say that ? You hardly know me . There ! We found the van . It 's been abandoned . We see you . Don 't go near it until we 've run a scan . Klaus ! The van was booby trapped . Probably a time bomb . Jo ? We 've lost radio contact . I see her . She 's moving ! You okay ? Katharina ! She was in the van ! I don 't think so . JO : They must have switched to another vehicle . The bomb was just to put us off the trail . She 's found something . Let 's run a sweep of the area . Omar has arrived . Who is this woman ? My wife . She was with him . It was unavoidable . Take care of her . Touch her and you won 't get a word from me . Wait ! We want Hauptmann Herzfeld 's cooperation . Perhaps Frau Herzfeld 's presence here will encourage him in this . What do you want from me ? It is simple enough . I need your talents , Hauptmann . I want you to train my men to fly this plane you are familiar with . Why ? It is a Soviet aircraft . The Soviets were generous enough to provide me with several of these aircrafts . Unfortunately , they don 't seem too eager that they should be piloted by men under my command . Perhaps they think you will use them for your own ends and not theirs . Very perceptive of you , Hauptmann . Do I have your cooperation ? I can make life very comfortable for you . Or very uncomfortable . I have no choice . I will work for you under one condition . You let Katharina go . Now . Come , come , Hauptmann . If I release your wife , what power of persuasion will I have over you ? My desire to live . I think I have the object of your desire . ACHMED : Let 's go . The pilot is waiting . Nothing out of the ordinary down there . I 'll sweep back and get Jo . Maybe she 's had better luck . ( JO SPEAKS FRENCH ) ( RESPONDS IN FRENCH ) He hasn 't seen anything . But he says there 's an abandoned farm down the road . All right . Let 's go . You have made the right decision , Hauptmann . Got something , that farm house . There 's a chopper parked out back . Bingo . There 's Jo 's car . Wait . What are you doing ? Unfortunately , we did not foresee the extra passenger . There will be only room for four of us . You will not kill her . Don 't worry , Hauptmann . Achmed will find his own way home . Achmed . Omar ! Look ! ( GUNFIRE ) Katharina , get inside ! ( GUNSHOT ) Chopper 's coming up to starboard . ( INAUDIBLE ) He 's coming back for more ! Thank you . You have saved what is most precious to me . MIKE : She 's a brave woman . You 're not so bad either , you know . ( BOTH SPEAK GERMAN ) ( SPEAKS FRENCH ) ( LAUGHS ) Thanks . Great . Give them our congratulations . And tell them to drop over when they 're finished . SAINT JOHN : Well , don 't keep us in suspense . Tell us what happened . Klaus and Katharina have been granted refugee status . All right . That 's terrific . That 's wonderful . MIKE : All right , that 's beautiful . JO : I love the way you pull strings , Jason . Well , they deserve all the help we can give them . If it wasn 't for Klaus , we would have never found the security leak . MIKE : Hey , what about Kenderson ? We nailed him . He 's out of business . ( MIKE WHOOPS ) Had enough of playing doubles , Mike ? Yeah , I don 't wanna do that again . Um , look , if I have a choice between playing double or nothing , guess which one I 'd choose ? Nothing . You 're right . Nothing . JO : I don 't know , I kind of liked the mustache . Yeah , if you like it that much , you can have it . Nah , I 'd have to buy a whole wardrobe . It would never end . I think a toast is in order . Uh-huh . To the new citizens . Klaus and Katharina . ( TOASTING ) Oh , I think I 'll get a beer . Beer ? Better get me one , yeah . Is this from the Company ? Yeah , it 's cheap . ( INAUDIBLE )

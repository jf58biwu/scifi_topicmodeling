 If this bug gets out of control , it 'll make AIDS and Cancer look like the common cold . I want my money now ! I want my money now ! You hear me ? We introduce the disease . Concentrated death . Rats . Come on , you little buggers , chew ! No ! ( PEBBLE RATTLING ) Who 's there ? Show yourself ! You . You were supposed to phone me . You lied to me . You said you wanted another chance . A chance to help mankind . You will do the honorable thing . You will stop this madness . I 've finished with you , old man , ( SNIFFS ) And your money . LOCKE : Okay , Mr. Maverick . Let 's drive . I 've programmed the computer for hands-free helmet control . Not my style . Don 't you trust technology ? Let go of the stick . All right . All right . Look boss , no hands . And look left . Good . Let 's try it to the right . God , this is making me sick . You know what you 're doing , You and your transistor-happy friends ? Sure . We 're reducing the margin of human error for top guns like you . Now what ? Hammerhead stall . Look up slowly , and we 'll let it roll on the Z axis . ( INSTRUMENTS BEEPING ) Beautiful . Now the fun stuff . I 'm picking up our remote controlled drones on the scope now . LOCKE : First the boat . Remember , use your monotone voice commands like we practiced this morning . Got it . Computer connect . Cannons . Mark target . Longitude west 125 degrees . Fire cannon . Bullseye ! As easy as sitting duck . I could blow it away with my eyes closed . Okay . Here comes our flying drone . Use the laser . MIKE : Here goes nothing . Let 's fry us a wing . Do it ! MIKE : Computer connect . Lasers , mark . Target vector 3.5 . Fire laser . Direct hit . Give that man a cigar . Uh-uh . What ? It was two inches off target . Marginal . Now you 're nitpicking . If you 've finished gloating , can I have my controls back , please ? I 'll take my fingertips over your computer chips . Be my guest . Perfection , pure perfection . You know , I don 't care how sophisticated computers get , It 'll never replace gut instinct , or gut reflexes . That may be , but one of these days , the switch over to computer control just may save your butt . My butt ? I hate backseat drivers . Put the coffee on , Jo . I 've had enough of this for one day . Yes , sir . Anything else ? Pipe , slippers , your evening paper perhaps ? MIKE : Hey , what is this , pick on Mike week ? Do me one favor , will you ? Tell Saint John that it 's his turn not to fly this thing next time . Yeah , well , I 'll tell him when he gets back . He 's still sweating it out with Tim . ( SCOFFS ) Typical . I do all the work and he gets the R R. JO : Yeah , well that 's how it goes . Yeah , I guess so . Some more hills around here than usual . All going up . Well , at least the weather is cooperating . Not like that time in Bangkok . Thirty days . And 30 nights . Of nonstop rain . ( SCOFFS ) Man , that was wet . Yeah , you danced through the officers ' club like Gene Kelly in Singin ' in the Rain . ( LAUGHS ) Of course , all you had on was an umbrella . Hey , that was you , not me . Your mind 's a little faulty . No , I think you better get a second opinion on that , Doctor . ( BEEPER BEEPING ) Duty calls . Okay . Okay . What 's the fuss ? WOMAN : Dr. Shimizu , it 's your father . There 's been an accident . Gonna be all right , Tim ? Yeah , I 'm okay . I 'm okay . I don 't care what they say . My father 's death was no accident . What do you mean ? It just doesn 't make sense . Too many things just don 't add up . You mean the booze ? For starters . My father had the odd drink , sure . But I never saw him falling down drunk in my life . When was the last time you talked to him ? It was a while ago , I guess . He and I didn 't exactly see eye to eye . You mean ' cause you disagreed on Vietnam . Yeah , that and everything else . He was a very traditional man . He sat on this mat and prayed every night . He would never disgrace himself with drink and then sit on his mat and pray . It 's not my father . So maybe he had a drink after he prayed . They did find a bottle out in the pond . Yeah , but why take the bottle outside ? Well , maybe he heard something out in the garden while he was pouring it . Exactly . Something or someone . Look , Tim , the police have been all over this place . If there was something to be found , don 't you think they would have turned it up ? I don 't know . I just don 't know . But I do know my father did not die drunk , face-down in a pond . Come on , I got a friend over at the Coroner 's Office . I 'm gonna do those blood tests myself . Look , Tim , don 't you think we ought to let the police handle this ? Saint John . I gotta know how my father died . Locke , I 'm at Tim 's lab . I 'll be here a while . As long as he needs me . I understand . We 'll cover for you . And , Saint John . Give Tim our respects . They know what happened yet ? They 're still trying to work it out . Wasn 't Tim a medic in the army ? Yeah . He pulled Saint John out of a bout of malaria when everybody else wanted to leave him for dead . Ties like that run deep . My god . Look at this . What the hell is it ? The virus that killed my father . Virus ? I 've never seen anything like it . Must have invaded every cell in his blood system . The white count 's almost nil . But without white blood cells ... He 'd have no immunity at all . An instantaneous breakdown of the body 's defense system , then attacks on the central nervous system . My God . That house has to be sealed off . Everything my father touched could spread the infection . If this bug gets out of control , it 'll make AIDS and Cancer look like the common cold . Whoa ! Hold it . ( DEVICE BEEPING ) No trace of the virus . It 's clean . I 'll let the guys in forensics know they can get started . I know this is hard on you Tim , but did the Coroner give you any clue at all ? No , just that they found a puncture in his throat . The virus would have to be injected to work that fast . At least he felt no pain . ( SIGHS ) Why don 't you let the cops handle this , Tim ? You can 't do it all . Who 'd want to kill him ? He never harmed anyone in his life . He couldn 't . Even when they put him in that internment camp back in the ' 40s . He never became bitter or angry . I couldn 't understand it , but that was his way . He was a good man . That was the day he took over the plant . He was so proud . Bar-Med was about to go bankrupt from some scandal , but he put them back on track . He wanted me to work with him . But when I got back from the war ... Well , you know the rest of the story . What 's this all about ? TIM : " Former head of Bar-Med . " My father never said anything about this . He took over from someone who committed suicide . This guy Saunders . Never heard of him . Maybe somebody at Bar-Med has . HARPER : Yes , it was a real tragedy . Saunders was one of those rare individuals you only meet once in a lifetime . You sure you wouldn 't have one ? No . Thanks . A real genius with a passionate concern for his fellow human beings . Where does Tim 's father fit into all this ? Oh , he was a silent partner at first . So when the company went belly up , he took over ? Oh , no . Goodness , no . When Saunders ' wonder drug backfired , why we had to ... Bad side effects ? Side effects ? Well ... Yes , I suppose you could call a complete breakdown of brainwave activity as a side effect . You mean it was destroying people 's minds ? Animals . He was prevented from using it on humans . It was supposed to cure all the ills of man . Instead it reduced 53 test subjects to cabbages . The government stepped in and took away his license , but that didn 't stop him . His wife was terminally ill , and he was convinced that he could cure it . But it didn 't work out . And that 's when he killed himself . Wouldn 't you ? And Shimizu had nothing to do with this drug ? Oh , no . He just stepped in to re-organize the company . I mean ... But that 's history now . I just can 't understand how this could be any connection between the drug scandal and Shimizu 's death . Well , that 's another loose end tied up . Thank you for your time , Doctor . Oh , well , I 'm sorry I couldn 't be more helpful . ( DOOR OPENS ) ( DOOR CLOSES ) Hello , Saunders ? It 's falling apart . I want my money now ! I want my money now ! You hear me ? I got your message . What 's up ? It 's even worse than I 'd imagined . It 's not organic at all . It 's a product of some very sophisticated genetic engineering . You mean this thing is manmade ? Who 'd be that crazy ? That 's the scary part . Whoever developed something this dangerous would have to be as mad as he is brilliant . But why create something so deadly ? What , germ warfare ? Who knows ? But we 're gonna have to trace this thing back to its ... Tim ! Somebody get an emergency team in here right away ! So what 's the word on Tim ? Well , they 've got him stabilized for now . He 's quarantined in a ward with a team from the Coroner 's Department . He and anybody else who came in contact with this virus . Sounds as if you 're lucky to me , buddy . LOCKE : Yeah . What do you got ? Well , I figured whoever developed something that heavy duty had to have a lot of money to do it . So I ran a check on Bar-Med 's finances . LOCKE : And ? And it looks like they spent over $ 2 million in development funds over the last two years . I 'd say that was unusual . Especially for a company that was almost out of business a couple of years ago . So what 's the money source ? There 's one place to look . Bar-Med . Do we go in ? Yeah . From what I can see , they aren 't equipped to handle that kind of high-tech work . If they built this bug , they got $ 2 million worth of hardware stashed someplace . Mike and I will fly backup . On one condition . LOCKE : What 's that ? No more of that remote control stuff . Okay . Take it easy , guys . All right , Harper 's office is the last one on the right . Got it . Cover me till I get inside . Okay . Good luck . He 's inside the grounds . LOCKE : Right . Locking into whisper mode . We 'll maintain an infrared scan on the warehouse in the back in case he 's got company . Oh , looks pretty quiet so far except for that one guard . Keep in touch . Right . I 'm going into the offices . Guys , looks like we 're not the only ones looking for answers . Somebody got here first . Better clear out of there , Jo . In a minute . ( GASPS ) LOCKE : What is it ? Jo ? Come in . Jo ? You were getting too close , Mr. Hawke , much too close . Take the body out to the warehouse , then gather up Harper . ( GRUNTING ) Doctor , he 's alive . Impossible . ( GRUNTS ) ( PANTING ) I thought you were dead . And you soon will be , Mr. Hawke . How do you ... Know who you are ? Dr. Harper was kind enough to inform me of your visit this afternoon . But he forgot to tell me that he 'd sold you the X-Vaccine . The what ? Take him below . Let 's go . There 's a light on in the greenhouse . And some people inside . I don 't know how many . Hang on . I 'm running a scan . ( SCOPE BEEPING ) Three of them . Do you copy , Saint John ? Saint John ? Where the hell is he , Jo ? I don 't know . I 'm gonna check it out . Hey ! They just disappeared . What are you talking about ? They 're gone . I 've lost the reading . Watch yourself , Jo . Things are getting weird . JO : You 're not kidding . There 's only one way out of here . I expect this is what you 're looking for , Mr. Hawke . Impressive , wouldn 't you say ? Especially when you consider it 's being run by a dead man . To paraphrase Mr. Twain , the rumors of my suicide were greatly exaggerated , by me , I 'm afraid . Too bad . Oh , it was nothing , really . A flaming car off the Coast Highway . The body washed out to sea . Much to the chagrin of my tormentors , I 'm sure . They all said it wasn 't ready . Hmm . They didn 't believe me , did they , Price ? They will now , Dr. Saunders . Won 't do you any good , Saunders . That 's where you 're wrong , Mr. Hawke . You see , everyone 's looking for a miracle drug . I happen to have one . Only first , we introduce the disease . We call it Virus X. X for the unknown . But we know what it is , don 't we , Price ? Concentrated death . Courtesy of a rather virulent strain of malaria , plus a considerable amount of genetic tinkering on my part . There 's enough in this vial to wipe out an entire city . Of course , that would take a day or two . It 's so much more effective when it 's delivered directly into the bloodstream . Like you killed Shimizu ? He was a part of this , wasn 't he ? Very good , Mr. Hawke . I was beginning to think you survived the virus by your sheer tenacity . Shimizu . The old fool . He was an idealist . He wanted to take the serum to the government for tests . It 's my creation . I 'll prove my genius to the world in my own way . I found Saint John 's radio . And there 's a dart like the one that killed Harper . Don 't touch it . It means Saint John 's ... It doesn 't mean anything . This is not time to panic . Just keep looking . We 're continuing our scan . I want a full blood series . If he hasn 't been vaccinated , prepare a stronger concentration of the virus for injection . We 'll see just how immune you are . And then what ? You thaw out your instant plague and kill thousands of people ? For what ? Don 't be naive , Hawke . I 'll be able to ask for anything I want once they discover I have the only cure . And finally , they will recognize me . Mary believed in me . She knew . But they wouldn 't let me help her in time . They couldn 't look beyond their own petty virtues to see that my cure could have worked . So they crucified me . Well , now it 's their turn . You can 't hold the world hostage , Saunders . This time , I 've not only created the cure , but the sickness as well . And I 'm going to make them pay for it . ( GRUNTS ) No ! I need him alive . It 's gonna be daylight soon , where the hell is he ? ( SCOPE BEEPING ) I 'm picking up a pattern of high lead content under the greenhouse . Yeah ? Think it could be the structural footings ? LOCKE : Not outside the walls , it isn 't . Jo , they must have gone underneath someplace . Check the floor . It 's an underground lab ? LOCKE : I can 't get an infrared fix on any people down there . It must be constructed of some kind of shielding material . ( WHIRRING ) I think I found it . I 'm going down . Hey , Jo , wait for some backup . Jo ? Damn ! ( SIGHS ) ( DOOR KNOB RATTLING ) Come on ! ( GRUNTS ) ( EXHALES ) PRICE : We 're ready now , Doctor . I 'm not going anywhere until I have the results . Well ? He has a natural immunity . What ? He has a huge buildup of antibodies . He must have had an extreme case of malaria at one time . SAUNDERS : So that 's what it is . I hadn 't counted on that . You 're a lucky man , Mr. Hawke . Rats . Why does it have to be rats ? Get those out to the warehouse . We 've wasted enough time . Looking for something ? Still nothing . Damn ! Saint John ? Jo ? Hey , would one of you guys answer me ? Come on , you little buggers , chew ! I won 't call you " you dirty rats " anymore . That 's it boys , keep it up . Got a nice hunk of cheese for you in my pocket for you , I promise . Let go of me ! Jo ! I came to rescue you . You 're doing a great job so far . Come here . Was getting caught part of your plan ? ( SHRIEKING ) Rats ! SAINT JOHN : Oh , no , no . Those are just my buddies . Yeah , and they 're probably all infected . Yeah , some of them are dead already . JO : Wonderful . Now what ? What about Hawke and the girl ? We don 't need them anymore . We might as well see if he and his pretty friend have built up an immunity to bullets as well . ( JO SCREAMS ) Look out ! Stop them ! Stop them ! Catch them ! Look , we better burn this place out . Extreme heat is the only thing that 'll kill the virus . What about the vaccine ? The antidote . Here . How much ? I don 't know . Sorry about this , Jo . It 's the only chance you 've got . LOCKE : Wait a minute . Heat reading coming from the greenhouse . It 's a fire . SAINT JOHN : Stop Saunders , he 's got the virus . ( ALL COUGHING ) He 's making a run for it . MIKE : Not if I can help it . Jo 's been hit . But she 's coming around . You okay ? Yeah . All right , everybody 's up . Blow this rat hole . Fire will kill the bug . Okay , whatever you say , buddy . That ought to do it , guys . Now go after Saunders . He 's got the last of the virus . I got a fix on him . He 's heading for the middle of the city . Damn , this one 's gonna be tricky . LOCKE : He stopped . Somewhere near the waterfront . Keep an eye peeled . Just great . Come on , get back . Get back , all of you ! Come on , out of the way . Ladies and gentlemen , it is my great honor to present to you the X-Virus ! As it warms up , it will embrace you , each and every one of you , in a grip of death ! LOCKE : Got him . Can 't risk coming too close . If we panic him , he 'll throw the damn thing . Then we 'll nail him from here . Can 't just use that 40mm cannon in the middle of the city . You got a point there . MIKE : Is he talking ? See if you can get a fix on him . You 're too late , gentlemen . The guy 's a nut cake . And dangerous . If we shoot him , he 'll drop it . Then we 'll shoot it . In 10 seconds , the virus will thaw ... The laser . ... and there 's nothing you can do about it ! I 'm switching to automatic . The computer will do it . I 'll give co-ordinates . Ten ! Nine ! LOCKE : Computer connect . We 've only got one shot at this . Are you sure ? I 'm sure . Six ! Lasers , mark target . Four ! What the hell ? Mike , what are you doing ? Two ! Trust me . One ! Sorry , Locke . I guess I put more faith in hardware than software . I guess the force was with you , Mike . Well , looks like Bar-Med 's gone out of business for good this time . Can 't believe my father was suckered in like that . It wasn 't just him , they all were . Saunders was a powerful man . Powerful ? He was a maniac . The irony is that vaccine he developed to counteract the virus , it 's testing out as a powerful treatment against malaria . If only he 'd concentrated on the cure instead of the disease . ( POOL BALLS CLATTER ) ( EXCLAIMS ) Oh , God ! Oh , now , come on , big guy . Get it together . Get back in there . Well , somebody 's gotta teach you a lesson in humility . Yeah okay , teach . Shoot . Number five . MIKE : This one ? The orange number five ? Yeah . Yeah , and somebody 's gotta teach you how to shoot pool . You sure you don 't want to , uh , go to computer assist on this one , Mikey ? No , I think I 'll just use the same skill and concentration I used firing that laser . Thanks a lot , Saint John . All right , now remember , be cool , stay loose , take your time . Will you shoot ? Okay , number 11 in the left end . Be careful . ( CHUCKLING )

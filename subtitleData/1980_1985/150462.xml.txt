 - What 's this game called ? - Lightcycle . Damn ! You 're getting brutal and needlessly sadistic , Sark . Thank you , Master Control . We 've kidnapped military programs . I can arrange more lethal matches . - interested ? - Sure . I 'd love to go up against one of those guys . It 'd make a nice break from those accounting cream puffs . - What branch of the service ? - Strategic Air Command . Nice ! Look . This is all a mistake . I 'm just a compound interest program . I work at a savings and loan . - l can 't play these video games ! - Sure you can . - You look like a natural athlete . - Me ? I get out of breath checking on T-bill rates . You 're gonna make my User , Mr. Henderson , very angry . - He 's a Full Branch Manager . - Another religious nut ! I 'd say " Welcome , friend , " but not here . I don 't know what I 'm doing here . Do you believe in the Users ? Sure. lf I don 't have a User , - who wrote me ? - That 's what you 're doing here . Master Control Program 's been snapping up all us programs who believe . If you 're useful , he takes over all your functions . If he can 't use you , he sends you here to get your bits blasted . - What 's your name ? - Crom . I 'm Ram . They 'll train you for the games , but ... I hope you make it . What 's been going on in the other sectors ? I 've been stuck here for 200 microcycles . It 's murder out there . You can 't travel in your own microcircuits ... without permission from Master Control Program . Sending me to play games . Who does he calculate he is ? Okay , Clu , tonight we check everything in the right hand column . Where are you ? There you are . - Clu ? - Yes , sir . - This is top priority . - l know , sir . It isn 't just correcting my bank statement or phone bill . - This is a must ! - l understand . I wrote you and taught you everything about the system . - Thank you , but - - No buts . That 's for users . You 're the best program ever written . - You 're dogged and relentless . - Let me at ' em . That 's the spirit . Keep that tank rolling . I 'll cover you from this end . You think we can merge with this memory , Bit ? Yes . Hmm . Flynn is saying to look over here . I don 't see what we 're looking for . Come on , you scuzzy data , be in there . Uh-oh ! We 've got company . I don 't believe this . A Recognizer . There 's too many ! What is this ? Ahhh ! Dammit ! Get out of here ! Yes-yes-yes . Busted again ! That was my best program . Got a pirate program here . Says his name 's Clu . What did he pull ? He came into the system with a stolen password . We caught him trying to raid our high-clearance memory . No ! I must 've gotten in by mistake . - Who programmed you ? - l was simp - Ahhh ! You 're in trouble , program . Make it easy on yourself . Who 's your User ? Forget it , Mister High And Mighty Master Control . You aren 't making me talk . Suit yourself . Ahhh ! Get me Dillinger . Good evening , Mr. Dillinger . - Thank you , Peter . You can go now . - Yes , sir . No problem , Master C. lf you 've seen ... one electronics show , you 've seen them all . What 's up ? - Flynn ? - Yes . He 's looking for that old file . Can 't you appropriate it ? I put it in my memory which he hasn 't located . - He might find it . - l 'm afraid so . I spotted him this time and kept him out . It 's getting trickier . We should shut down all access ... until we find that Flynn . - There 's a 68.71 % chance you 're right . - Cute . Come on ! Alan , think I can have some of your popcorn ? Yeah , sure . Sit down . Thank you . We 've had to shut down ... all Group-7 personnel ... just briefly . Security . Someone has been tampering . You don 't think it 's me ! I don 't even balance my checkbook on downtime . It 'll only be a couple of days . - What 's your project ? - lt 's called Tron . It 's a security program . It monitors contacts between our system and others . Anything not scheduled , it shuts it down . I sent you a memo . - Part of the Master Control Program ? - No . It 'll run independently and watchdog the MCP as well . Sounds good . We should have you running in a couple of days . I hope . Okay . Thanks . Oh , boy . Mr. Dillinger , I 'm very disappointed in you . I 'm sorry . I can 't afford an independent programmer monitoring me . You realize how many systems I 've gone into ? How many programs I 've appropriated ? Come on ! A couple of days ! Hi , Dr. Gibbs . Here goes nothing . You hear what you just said ? " Here goes nothing . " Actually , we propose to change something ... into nothing and back again . You might have said , " Here goes something , here comes nothing . " Right . This is the big moment . This 'll narrow your theory that the scan U-V beam ... is superior to single pulse exposure . Laser activity will exist in 30 seconds . Put on your goggles . Leave the bay . Let 's see if we 've got the green light . - Target area shielded ? - They verified safety . 20 seconds . - Looks good . - Let her rip . This is what we 've been waiting for . 10 seconds . 5 seconds . Perfect ! - Beautiful ! - Hi , Alan . Having fun disintegrating things ? Not disintegrating , digitizing . A laser dismantles the molecular structure . Molecules remain suspended in the laser beam . When the computer plays out the model , the molecules fall back into place , - and voilá ! - Great . Can it send me to Hawaii ? You 've got to purchase your program 30 days in advance . - How 's it going upstairs ? - Frustrating . I had Tron almost ready ... when Dillinger cut everyone with Group-7 access out . Ever since he got ... that Master Control Program , the system 's got more bugs than a bait store . You gotta expect some static . Computers are machines . They can 't think . and the people will stop . I 'm gonna put some data through . - See you . - Bye . Come on . - Did you say Group-7 access ? - Yeah . What a hassle . I was all set . - Did he say why ? - Something about tampering . Flynn has been thinking ... about breaking into the system ... ever since Dillinger canned him . And he had Group-7 access . Flynn had access to you , too . I want to go to Flynn 's place . - What for ? - To warn him . - Of what ? - That Dillinger 's onto him . I don 't see why I have to do that guy any favors ! I don 't know what you saw in that guy . I loved him for his brain . Don 't put change in the meter . We 're gonna need it for the games . Boy ! I haven 't been here in a long time . Hey , Bobby , up here . - Where is he ? - l don 't know . - Where is he ? - l don 't know . Somewhere in here lost in one of his games . - Do you know where Flynn is ? - On his machine . He 's really on a roll ! One more Reco before he ties . Another Reco and he gets the world 's record . He 's going for the record . The all-time record coming up . This is it . It 's all over . Flynn 's gonna make him a part of history ! Flynn , how 'd you do it ? It 's all in the wrists . 999,000 points ! Hey , good to see you guys . Nothing classes up the joint like a clean-cut couple . We gotta talk . You can 't hear yourself think in here . Come on . - Come on . - l 'll be down in a minute . How 's the world of serious science ? Go make yourselves at home . The best programmer Encom ever saw , and he winds up playing space cowboy ... - in some back room . - Let me handle this . - Go right ahead . - Have you been sneaking ... into the Encom system ? You never were much for small talk . Does she still leave her clothes all over ? - No ! - Alan ! I mean , not that often . You can see why all his friends ... - are 14 years old . - Touché . I have been doing a little hacking . - You did break in . - Tried to . I can 't seem to quite get the connection . - lf l had a direct terminal - - Flynn , are you embezzling ? Embezzling is such an ugly word , Mr. Bradley . Actually , I 'm trying to get some evidence together . - l don 't get it . - Okay . - l don 't get it . - Okay . Sherman , set the Way-Back Machine for 3 years ago . Kevin Flynn , one of Encom 's ... brightest young software engineers . He 's so bright that he goes in at night , and begins writing a program for video games ... called " Space Paranoids . " You invented " Space Paranoids " ? " Paranoids , " " Matrix Blaster , " a whole slew of ' em . I was this close to starting my own enterprise . But enter another ; not so young or so bright , but very sneaky ; Ed Dillinger . One night , our boy Flynn ... goes to his terminal , tries to read up his file . I get nothing . There 's a big blank . 3 months later ... Dillinger presents Encom with 5 video games ... that he 's invented . The slime didn 't even change the names ! He gets a big promotion . Thus begins his meteoric rise ... to - What is he ? - Senior Exec . - Senior Exec ? Meanwhile , the kids ... are putting 8 million quarters a week into Paranoid machines . I don 't see a dime , except what I squeeze outta here . I still don 't understand why you want to break in . Somewhere in one of these memories is the evidence . If I got in far enough I could reconstruct it . - My password , Dillinger 's instructions to divert - - Too late ! Dillinger 's cut off Group-7 access . Wait . What are you saying ? The guy knows what you 're up to . Great . You 're kidding me ? Now there is nothing to stop him . It 's just Dillinger and the MCP running things . Not if my Tron program was running . That 'd shut the system down . If your file was in there - lf we can get in there , I can forge a Group-6 access . Well ? Shall we dance ? I shut down Group-7 for a very good reason . If our people can 't get access to their programs - You know how frustrating it is when you 're researching . I sympathize , but I have data coming from MCP ... telling me there 's something screwy going on . That MCP is half our problem ! The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do ! I can 't worry about every user request . User requests are what computers are for . Doing our business is what computers are for ! Encom isn 't the business you started in your garage . We 've accounts in 30 countries , new defense systems , one of the most sophisticated pieces of equipment . I know all that . Sometimes I wish I were back in that garage . That can be arranged , Walter . That was uncalled for . You can remove Alan and me , but we helped create it . Our spirit remains in every program we designed . Walter , it 's getting late . I 've got better things to do . Don 't worry about Encom anymore . It 's out of your hands now . I don 't think I 'm cleared for this . - l 'm certainly not . - Want to move aside ? Give the kid a little room . This guy 's a little like Santa Claus . I make these myself . You want one ? They never should have gotten rid of me . - Now that is a big door . - Shut up . I programmed you to want too much . I was planning to hit the Pentagon . The Pentagon ? It shouldn 't be harder than any big company . - This is what I get for using humans . - l wrote you ! What do you want with the Pentagon ? The same thing I want with the Kremlin . With the information I can access , I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human . If you think you 're superior to us - You wouldn 't want me to dig up Flynn 's file ... - and read it up on a VDT at the Times . - You wouldn 't dare ! Hi . Hi . Working late ? Yeah . Okay . Come here . I 'm gonna put him at my terminal ... and meet you in your office upstairs . Don 't fall asleep . If and when I activate Tron , you 'll only have a few minutes ... before Dillinger catches the break . As long as we stay off the top floor , Dillinger will never know we 've been in here . Good luck , hot shot . - Ahem . - Flynn ! After you . Keep those programers out of the system . Get me that Chinese language file . - You are going to stick with me ? - What for ? You 're the one who never needed help , remember ? I 'm scared of the dark . All this technology scares me . This way ! - When did they put this in ? - This is where l work . I 've got a direct terminal in the laser target area . You can stay there all night . Like a man says , " There 's no problems , only solutions . " Remember , this lazer is my life 's work . Don 't spill anything . Huh ? Have fun , sweetheart . Hey , it 's the big Master Control Program . Sit right there . Make yourself comfortable . Remember the time we spent playing chess together ? Stop ! Please . You realize I can 't allow this ? How are you gonna run the universe ... if you can 't answer unsolvable problems ? Let 's see what you 've got . I 'd like to see what you 're made of . You don 't look a thing like your pictures . You 're entering a big error . I 'm going to put you on the game grid . You want games ? This isn 't happening . It only thinks it 's happening . Vacate entry port , program . I said , move ! Ah ! Hey ! Look , if this is about those parking tickets , I can explain everything . Prepare all programs for war games . I 've got a challenge for you , Sark ; a new recruit . It 's a tough case , but treat it in the usual manner . Train him for the games , let him hope , then blow him away . You 've got it . I 've been hoping you 'd send me somebody with a little guts . What kind of program is he ? He 's not any kind of program . He 's a User . - A User ? - That 's right . He pushed me in the real world . Somebody pushes me , I push back . So I brought him here . What 's the matter ? You look nervous . Well , I was just - l don 't know . A User , I mean - Users wrote us . A User even wrote you ! No one User wrote me. I 'm worth millions of their man-years . What if - ? You 'd rather take your chances with me ? Want me to slow down your power cycles ? I need that ! Then pull yourself together . Get this clown trained . I want him in the games until he dies playing . Acknowledge . Acknowledged , Master Control . End of line . Game unit 18 . In here , program . Who you calling " program , " program ? Ah ! New guy ? Another free program off line . You think the Users are still there ? They 'd better be . I don 't want to bust out of here ... and find nothing but cold circuits . Hey . - Who are you guys ? - Hold it ! Watch those force fields . You 'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt . Just so I can tell my friends ... what this dream is about , where am I ? You 're a ... guest of the Master Control Program . Oh , great . - He makes you play video games . - No sweat . I play video games better than anybody . Move out ! This way . You , you come this way . - l 've gotta see the guy in charge . - You will . Look operative . Command Program Sark 's carrier is approaching . He will explain the training procedures . Greetings . The Master Control Program has chosen you ... to serve your system on the game grid . Those of you who continue ... to profess a belief in the Users ... will receive the standard substandard training , which will result in your eventual elimination . Those of you ... who renounce ... this superstitious and hysterical belief , will be eligible to join the warrior elite ... of the MCP . You will each receive an identity disk . Everything you do or learn ... will be imprinted on this disk . If you lose your disk or fail to follow commands , you will be subject to immediate de-resolution . That will be all . Move out . Who 's that guy ? Tron . He fights for the Users . That 's pretty good . You gotta be good if you want to survive . What 's your name ? My name 's Ram . Hey , Ram , what were you before ? I was an actuarial program . I worked for a big insurance company . Really gives you a great feeling ... helping folks plan for their future needs . If you think of the payments as an annuity , the cost is quite minimal . Yeah , that 's great . Actuarial program . Nice . How about yourself ? I don 't remember too much . Name 's Flynn . Disorientation is normal in transport . It 'll come back . This is it . Good luck , Flynn . Sir , conscript being moved ... from pit cell to ring game . Hey ! You guys sure are friendly . Wait . Let him fight one of his own kind . You think you 're gonna wipe me out ? No - Hey ! That new guy was asking about you . Too bad he 's in a match . I 'll probably never meet him . You might . There 's something different about him . Okay . That was a very fancy shot . Okay , here 's an easy one . Finish the game ! - No ! - Kill him . No . You 'll regret this . Ahh ! I want him in the games until he dies playing . This is the holding area for the lightcycles . You made it ! Wait here . Alan . Where did you hear that name ? - That 's your name . - The name of my User . How did you know ? - l 'm a program from a User that knows Alan . - He 's disoriented , Tron . I 'm remembering all kinds of stuff , like my User wants me to go after the MCP . - My User wants that , too . - l know . Prepare to transport to lightcycle grid . We have transport . Wow . This is Blue Leader to Blue bikes . Run these guys into your jet walls . Copy , Blue Leader . This is Gold-1 to Gold-2 and 3 . Split up . Take them one on one . Watch it ! Ahh ! Taking him into the maze . This is it . Come on . Gold-3 to Gold-2 and 1 . I 'm getting out of here and you guys are invited . Got it . Ready ? - Ready . - So long , sucker ! Ahh ! Greetings , programs ! Warriors escaping game grid . This is an illegal exit . You must return to game grid . This is an illegal exit . Gold-2 to Gold-3 . Those demons are coming down . Get them ! Send out every game tank in the grid . Get them ! I should never have written all those tank programs . Targets leaving protective field . Missed ! All units exiting game arena . Target units accelerating ! Pursuit force minus one tank . Close ranks . Oh , man . On the other side of the screen , it all looked so easy . They must 've gone right past us . We made it ... this far . Pursuit force reporting . We lost visual contact . Get the pursuit forces back into the canyons . Those programs never made it out . We 'll have them back before the interrupt interface . We 'd better , null unit . I 'll be lucky if the MCP doesn 't blast me . I want those conscripts ! What is it ? What do you see ? Watch it . Come on , you little bugger . Look at that . When do we pay our visit ... to the old Master Control ? What ? There 's just 3 of us . If you know anybody who 's got an army for rent , fine , but my User told me to take that sucker out , or I 'm never getting out . We can 't get to the MCP ... without the help of my User . I have to get to that input / Output tower , and communicate with him . Check in with Alan . Maybe he knows - What 's that ? That ... is just ... what I need right now . Oh , it 's nice . Incredible . Boy , you forget how good the power feels ... until you get to a pure source . My friends , my fellow conscripts , we have scored ! I feel so much better . Pursuit force reporting . No sign of escaped units . Moving into next sector . Thank you . I can feel it . Feel what ? You okay ? Alan-1 . Let 's move out ! Come on , Flynn , put a cork in it . One second ! Ahhh ! Range - 9 , Mark - 45 , 48 degrees . Hold it . Hold it . Fire ! Ram , Flynn , do you read me ? Pursuit force reporting . 2 escaped units de-rezzed . No ! Tron unit heading into next sector . Ram ? Come on ! We gotta get outta here . No sign of life . Looks like we got ' em . Continue pursuit of remaining conscript . Acknowledged . Proceeding towards sector frontier . We 're gonna make it , Ram . We gotta find you a place to rest . Hang in there , Ram . This looks like a good spot . Those tanks won 't find us here . Okay . I thought this was supposed to be easy . What 's going on ? You see this ? You shouldn 't be able to do that . Now for some ... real User power . Hey , this looks promising . This is just like the old arcade grips . Let 's get this show on the road . Now we 're smokin ' ! How can you steal a Recognizer ? You don 't look good . We 'll get you fixed up . Come here . Oh , my User ! Users are Users . They - Are you a User ? Flynn , help Tron . Ram ! Ram ? Damn Recognizer . The thing just goes straight . I gotta get to that I / O tower . Program Alu , request additional information . Prepare hanger for game simulation transport . Attention all units , lock onto matrix code . Prepare for digital beam transport . Activate hanger doors . What 's the progress on the simulation ? 30 , 56 , 99 are correct . Limited 4 and 8 are missing . Don 't scream . Yori ! 30 , 56 , 99 are correct . - Limited 4 and 8 are missing . - No , I - Tron ! Ah ! Yori . I knew you 'd escape . They haven 't built a circuit that could hold you . Listen ! We have to make plans . Where can we go ? This way , quickly . Hey ! Hold it ! - Yes ? - What do you mean , " yes " ? Yes ? That all you can say ? No . - Anything else ? - Yes . - Positive and negative , huh ? You 're a bit . - Yes . Where 's your program ? Isn 't he gonna miss you ? No . I 'm your program ? Yes . Another mouth to feed . Yes-yes-yes-yes ! Watch out for nested macros . - Who are these weirdos ? - lnoperative data pushers . Control Programs ! Come on . Pretty good drivin ' , huh ? Oh ! - No ! - Who asked you ? No-no-no-no ! Ahh ! This baby doesn 't handle so good in town . - What 's this do ? How ' bout this one ? - No , no . Here comes a headache . - Ahhh ! - No-no-no-no ! - We gotta stop this thing ! - Yes ! I 'm glad you agree ! Uh , I 'm fine . No problem . Oh , this town is full of live ones . This is where Tron said he was going . Losing Flynn . I don 't believe this . Halt ! More guards . They don 't see us . I 'll go first . - Are you all right ? - Yeah . Let 's do that some more . I think the guard saw me . Come on ! Halt . Dumont . I can 't stand this commotion . What do you want ? I 've come to communicate with my User . Difficult ... proposition at best . I could be de-rezzed for letting you in here . They hate this tower . They 'd close it down if they dared . They keep me around in case ... one of them wants to deal with the other world . Dumont ! My User has information that could ... make this a free system again . - Really ! You 'd have programs lined up to use this place , and no MCP looking over your shoulder . When you 've been in the system as long as I have , you hear many promises , reassurances , - many brave plans . - Please ? The guards are coming . There they are with the Guardian . All right , Yori . Who is your User , program ? Alan-1 . He calls me . May I pass ? All that is visible ... must grow beyond itself , and extend into the realm of the invisible . You may pass , my friend . The Tower Guardian is helping him . He thinks . Bring in the logic probe . More power ! It 's begun . Tron , location query . Confirm . Confirmed , Alan-1 . I am creating the information that will erase the MCP . Dedicate yourself to getting the disc into the heart ... of the MCP . This interface is located at its base . We will not be able to communicate again ... unless you succeed . Go ! This is the key to a new order . This code disc means freedom . I think they 're breaking in . - Thank you , Dumont . - Hurry ! The Users are waiting . Dumont ? Where 's the program ? What program ? Take him ! Stay close . If I can get us on the scanning transport beam , this simulation will take us ... across the game sea ... back into the central computer . Look out ! Ahhh ! Ahhh ! Commander , you 've enjoyed the power you 've been given . I wonder how you 'd take to working in a pocket calculator . We did take care of that User you sent us . lncompetent zero . Now you 've got 2 renegade programs ... flying all over the system in a stolen simulation . I 'll get them . It 's only a matter of time . You 've almost reached your decision gate . I can 't spare you any more time . End of line . It 's me , Flynn ! Flynn ! - Greetings , program . - You 're alive ! Barely . Yeah , I , uh ... Where 's Ram ? He didn 't make it . Come on . Lora . This is Flynn . The one who busted me out . Lora ? Well , then I owe him some thanks . It 's no big deal . I ought to know Lightcycle . I wrote the program . - You wrote the program ? - lt 's time I level with you . I 'm what you call a User . You 're a User ? I took a wrong turn somewhere . If you are a User , everything you 've done is according to a plan . You wish . You know what it 's like . You keep doing what it looks like you 're supposed to , no matter how crazy . That 's the way it is for programs , yes . Most of the time , that 's the way it is for Users , too . Stranger and stranger . So , nice looking ship you got here . What do you want done with the Tower Guardian , Dumont ? Put him with the others ? No , bit brain , prepare him for inquisition . I need a bit of relaxation . First , rezz up the carrier for pursuit . One other thing . Don 't think anymore . I do the thinking around here . This isn 't going to be easy . If those grid bugs get us , we 've had it . Had enough ? What do you want ? I 'm busy . Busy dying , you worn out excuse for an old program . Yes , I 'm old . Old enough to remember the MCP when it was a chess program . He started small and he 'll end small . Very funny . Maybe I should keep you around for a laugh . - What 's happening ? - Power surge in the MCP . Get off this beam . There isn 't a junction for 7 or 8 nano seconds . - There 's another beam ! - lt 's too far . He 's creating a junction . Did we make it ? Yeah . Hurray for our side . is he de-rezzing ? No , but I couldn 't tell you why not . I 'm all in one piece . I 'm still with you . Ohhh ! Tell the guy with the jackhammer to lay off . How 'd you do that ? Elementary physics : a beam of energy can always be diverted . Are we there yet , Mommy ? Sark ! Dumont ! Yori . Tron ? Tron 's dead . Who 's that ? That is a User . He came here to help us . Tron believed in him . If the Users can no longer help us , we 're lost . So , we have erased that program - No . - You were de-rezzed . - Not me , Sark . You 're nothing special , just an ordinary program . So are you , one that should have been erased . You 're nothing . Take that program to the holding pit . Please ! I 'm taking our friend ... and some other religious fanatics to Master Control . When I disembark , this ship and everything on board ... will automatically de-rezz . This means you . Move on ! Immediate vectors detached . Route us to the MCP . I want to get rid of this dead weight , and catch a transport beam to the game domain . These walls ... Yori , something 's happening . Hey . I still have power . Sark doesn 't know that . Leave me alone . We 've failed . Only if we give up ! Come on , look , the wall ! Yori . You brought me back . How ? Why did you bring me back ? I need your help . Come on ! Do something with these controls ! I 'm on it . The MCP , the heart of the whole system . I feel a presence . Another warrior is on the mesa . Sark ! We 're getting closer . I don 't know how you survived . It doesn 't matter . Prepare to terminate . All programs have a desire to be useful . In moments , you will no longer seek communication ... with each other or your superfluous Users . You 'll each be part of me . Together we will be complete . You should have joined me . We 'd have made a great team . - You 're very persistent . - l 'm also better than you . Sark ? All my functions are now yours . Take them . Sark ? Sark ? Look ! Your User can 't help you now , my little program . I got it . Steer us by the beam . Right next to it . What good will that do ? I 'm going to jump . It 's the only way to help Tron . Don 't . You 'll be de-rezzed . Don 't worry . Come on , let 's go ! We did it ! That 's nice . We thought you were dead . Where 's Flynn ? He threw himself into the beam and distracted the MCP ... just long enough for you to get your disc in . He saved us . He really did it . Look at the I / O towers . Every tower is lighting up . Priority one ! Try to look official . Here comes the boss . Pick me up in an hour . Greetings , programs .

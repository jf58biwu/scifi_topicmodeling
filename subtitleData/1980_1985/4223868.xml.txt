SINCE NATO 'S INSISTENCE ON POSITIONING MEDIUM-RANGE PERSHING-2s AND CRUISE MISSILES IN EUROPE HAS CAUSED GREAT BRITAIN TO RE-EVALUATE ITS OWN NUCLEAR COMMITMENT . SCRUB IT ALL TOGETHER IF THE LABOR PARTY HAD ITS WAY . YOU SEE , THE REAL FEAR IS THAT WHEN THE CHIPS ARE DOWN , AND THE RED LIGHT 'S BLINKING , THE UNITED STATES WON 'T REALLY WANT TO SACRIFICE CHICAGO FOR HAMBURG . OUR CORRESPONDENT IN EUROPE CONFIRMED THAT ACCORDING TO NATO INTELLIGENCE REPORTS , AS OF THIS MORNING , THERE ARE NOW 3 SOVIET TANK DIVISIONS POISED ALONG THE FULDA GAP . THE UNITED STATES ISSUED A STRONG PROTEST REGARDING THE SOVIET PRESENCE IN AN EMERGENCY SESSION OF THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL THIS MORNING . A PROTEST RESPONDED TO INDIRECTLY THIS AFTERNOON BY SOVIET-BORN MINISTERS MEETING IN BRUSSELS FOR TRADE TALKS WITH THE COMMON MARKET . SPEAKING WITH A.B.C. NEWS , THE SOVIET-BORN MINISTER CLAIMS THE UNITED STATES HAVE THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE ... YOU CAN ANSWER ONE QUESTION , THAT WON 'T HURT YOU NONE . ALL RIGHT , ONE QUESTION . WHERE 'S ALAN ?

IT 'S GOOD TO SEE HER SO EXCITED ABOUT THE MOVE . IS THAT WHAT 'S IMPORTANT ? HOW EXCITED SHE IS ? SHE 'D FOLLOW GARY AND THAT OLD RATTLETRAP TO NOME OR NEW MEXICO . SHE ONLY APPLIED TO BOSTON BECAUSE ... WAIT A MINUTE , LET ME TURN THIS UP NOW , WILL YOU ? I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THAT THING ALL DAY THE BLOCKADE OF WEST BERLIN CONTINUES . THE ACTION FOLLOWS REPORTS EARLIER THIS EVENING OF WIDESPREAD REBELLION AMONG SEVERAL DIVISIONS OF THE EAST GERMAN ARMY . TO REPEAT : EAST GERMANY TONIGHT SEALED OFF THE BORDERS TO WEST BERLIN , CLOSING THE 4 PRINCIPAL WEST GERMAN ACCESS CORRIDORS AT LAUENBERG , HELMSTEDT , HERLESHAUSEN AND RUDOLPHSTEIN . I DON 'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING . DO YOU WANT TO GO IN THE LIVING ROOM AND WATCH ? NO . I JUST WANT TO GO UPSTAIRS AND GET INTO BED WITH YOU .

EAST GERMANY TONIGHT TIGHTENED ITS STRANGLEHOLD ON WEST BERLIN BY HALTING ALL AIR TRAFFIC IN AND OUT OF TEGEL AND TEMPELHOF AIRPORTS , SEVERING THE CITY 'S LIFELINE TO THE WEST . THIS ACTION HAS BEEN CONDEMNED BY NATO FOREIGN MINISTERS AS A BLATANT , UNCONSCIONABLE VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW . JOLENE ! JOLENE ! JOLENE ! JOLENE ! JOLENE ! JOLENE ! JOLENE , YOU OPEN THIS DOOR RIGHT NOW , OR I 'LL NEVER TALK TO YOU AGAIN ! JOLENE ! ... TOMORROW BERLIN TIME , THAT 'S 6 : 00 A.M. EASTERN DAYLIGHT TIME , WOULD BE REGARDED AS AN ACT OF WAR .

SOVIET AMBASSADOR ANATOLI KURAGIN WAS SUMMONED TO THE WHITE HOUSE 3 QUARTERS OF AN HOUR AGO . SHE WAS IN MY ... WELL ? ALL RIGHT . YOU DON 'T HAVE TO TELL ME .

 Loss of Feeling . Jim Ripple 's Robot . " Mezhrabpom Films " Production Directed by Alexander Andriyevsky Hello ? Station 18 ? Over . Station 18 . Send the two students Hamilton Grim and Jim Ripple to conveying machine " B " Top secret . Stopwatch study . Conveying machine " B " . Two students . Hamilton Grim and Jim Ripple . To the Devil 's wheels . Top secret . Over . Two students . Attention , Jim ! Get ready ! - One second ! - One second ... - Forty ! - Forty ... Did you understand ? Top secret experiment . The conveying machine will move 0,3 faster in a minute . This is a crime ! Yet it 's only an experiment and ... an economy of 40 dollars per minute . Faster ! Faster ! Faster ! Don 't get behind ! Don 't get behind ! Don 't get behind ! Stand by everyone ! Everyone who won 't go will be dismissed ! Hurry up , faster ! Don 't get behind ! I 'm not getting tired . So am I. Let go ! Let go ! It was supposed that proletariat 's nerves are much stronger . And then a banker shot himself . The eighth banker in a week . That 's what I 'm talking about , we have to quit with machines and get back doing things with our own hands . Look ! Who is that ? Some crazy or a writer I guess . Automatic dolls . Automatic dolls . Automatic dolls . Jim ! Jim ! Don 't you recognize old Bill ? - What are you doing here ? - I 'm looking for a place to stay at night . And what about your invention ? It doesn 't have any military sense . And they won 't buy those . - I believe you keep on studying ? - Yes ! And you 'll see that the ... What I 'll see is that you will starve the way I do . If you continue to live in this damn country . Big lights . Jim ! Honey , what 's wrong with you ? I have destroyed it . What have you destroyed Jim ? That 's the matter of work . You see Clare , what we need is stop providing them things at all . Who , Jim ? Capitalists or working men ? Both of them . You are tired Jim , it 's stuffy here . I 'll open the window . Look Clare . The third shift is coming back . Look Clare . I 'll tell you everything and you will understand everything . I 'll become an engineer only because of you and Jack . But is this a solution ? It 's not for everyone . And the capitalists are trying to make us their assistants , all of us . We need only firm measures ! We need to destroy the fundament of this working question , and capitalism – as a result . This means that you are ? .. Jim , you are not creating this hell machine ? Well of course I 'm not . You see Clare , we have to destroy capitalism . We need a revolution in this nowhere going country . And in the country where the machines are developed , it will die itself ! Without any revolution . And you know Clare , I think I am able to create this revolutionary thing - the one that will change the whole world . Long-awaited day of graduating in a polytechnic was shaded from the very morning . Jim , you 've got a letter from Bill Harwood . Oh , Bill the engineer . I have met him at night near the overnight stop . Read it Clare , please . Farewell Jim . I have left for the new country that needs new engineers . That 's strange ... He didn 't say a word about it yesterday . I think they know how to use coal there And my invention could be useful I guess . Well , maybe . You never know . Maybe Bolshevism is good enough for wild Russia , but it 's not good with our culture . I 'm not really sure about this . It will be us , who will solve this problem , scientists and engineers . As the " Volcano " factory is closed now part of the workers are sent to " Big lights " factory . Workers from both factories are now on a half-week schedule . Due to difficulties in the industry the 20 % prices decrease was announced . Get lost ! Get lost ! It 's a strike ! The tight situation of national industry makes the whole nation suffer . - You heard it ? ! - Hey , hush there ! Employers don 't throw their workers on the street after they close the factories . They give them the opportunity to work 3 days a week . In charge of those who worked for 6 days a week . Half of the salary is much better than dying from a starvation ! We know about the decrease of prices , they want to ignite conveying machine as soon as possible . Your Jim has made this surprise along with them . What ? You lie ! - Jim Ripple is a student . - He tries to be an engineer already . He is my brother , he won 't betray the workers . We 've seen your Jim with some fascist . They were trying to speed the conveying machine up when the accident happened . Tom , please tell them it 's not true . Well ... I really don 't know ! The gala class in polytechnic . You know Mary , I am nervous a bit . Like it 's me who gets a diploma , but not Jim . Has anything happened ? Jack , tell me ! No Mary ... well , yes ... well , it 's that Charlie and I , we 've been moved to a half-week schedule at work . Oh , my God ! And I thought something happened to Jim . No ! Jim won 't let us down . However some weird guy told me today ... It 's bullshit , it 's not true ! Today is the big day ! The train will arrive in 20 minutes . Stop being so quite ! Come on ! Let 's meet Jim ! You are right ! Let 's just do it ! Great ! Thank you Jim ! You have grown and you 've been living with us ! Let yourself be a good example for all of us ! The whole working class is proud of its engineer ! You are with us , tomorrow and today , Long live Jim Ripple ! Hooray ! Quite ! Jim wants to speak . My friends ! I have become an engineer with your help ! And I 'll try to live up to your hopes as a worker and as an engineer . And I 'll succeed with the help of our new friend . Please meet ! This is " Micron " . A machine that is able to do almost everything . - Mum , mum , look ! - Oh , he is really terrible ! - What 's wrong with his ears ? This thing amuses . You can go to the circus with it . I hope that your engineer will stop creating dolls like this one . Oh really ? Take a look ! Jim ! Who is all this for ? It 's for you ! Capitalism makes a tool for enslavement out of any machines . The machines invade in people 's life . And I am going to make the step in technical development which will change everything . I have created an automatic device which can do anything . He will easily replace all the workers on any factory . What will happen ? The World Market will be overfilled . The prices will decrease . And without any revolution the capital itself will not exist any longer . One person told me today that you are a traitor . I called him a liar ... Bu I guess , I was wrong . We brought you up , taught you , and you have found the way how to throw all of us on the street . These machines are for you . For us ? And what about the government ? Really ... Have you forgotten about the prison , police and unemployment ? You will create these machines . Oh no ! The hands of your machines will be the hands of capitalism and they will choke us off sooner than capital itself will be destroyed according to your recipe . You fool ! Trying to make peace between two different worlds ! Don 't touch the machine Jack ! You scum ! The head worker Jack Ripple is the machine destroyer . Farewell ... brother . Jim ! Jim ! Let me pass , damn it all ! Oh , it 's you Jim . I 've been looking for you all evening . You 've got a telegram . Preliminary check for one hundred dollars . Total guarantee of independence and freedom . When is the express coming ? In twenty minutes . Give it to sister . Good evening . It 's from your brother . " Big Lights " village . A telegram for engineer Ripple . Preliminary check for one hundred dollars . Total guarantee of independence and freedom . Free laboratories and workshops . Exclusive license . Congratulations . Waiting for you . Signed by Hamilton Grim . On behalf of a father Percy Grim . Jim writes . I am right . Soon you 'll see everything yourself . Goodbye . Yours , Jim . Keep in mind ! Jim Ripple is no longer a part of our family . Things have gone in due course and in half a year ... The floor is given to my son , engineer-lieutenant Hamilton Grim . Dear gentlemen ... Mister Rotterdam . Dear gentlemen . " Robot " is a machine , that makes the functions of a man . This very word " robot " – it is similar to " worker " , you 'll get the point right away . We really have to look for a new worker . The cheap , incessant and invulnerable one , And who won 't be a revolutionary menace . Only yesterday the technical thought was close to imperfect . There were automatic devices , cigar sellers , doorkeepers , photographers , policemen . Today it is all more serious . The plane flies without a pilot . The tank doesn 't need a driver . The ship goes without any crew . But tomorrow it 'll be a " Robot " ! The universal controller of everything . The machine that looks like a man , like the one he is to replace in the nearest future . The Robot of engineer Ripple – is a Tomorrow . It is a genius solution of a so-called " proletariat problem " . Let take a look at this Robot 's working scheme . His radio set receives the commands . Or even a sound , or an order . And passes the signals to a distribution block , which controls this machine 's will . The needful electric energy comes from the inner block " C " , which is our engineer 's secret . What 's the capacity of this block ? Ten thousand ampere hours ! Whaa-a-at ? Engineer Ripple . Let us not waste our time . - Music Hall ? - Attention please . Please meet . Ripple 's universal worker . rUr ! Exactness . Exactness , strength and quick reaction . Today it 's a sound and an order . Tomorrow it 's the language and the thought . THE THOUGHT ! Because the thinking process is also material . Engineer , this is your invention . Now ? During the crisis ? It is insane ! I 've never heard of a crisis in a military industry . Excuse me . I 'm not a military person . But I think that tanks and battleships are more frightful than this . Oh yes , I do respect dreadnought , but I 'd prefer the crew on it with the nerves of steel like this . There was a hard work in the attic in order to restore the broken automat . Aren 't you afraid to spoil it ? Not at all . It would be hard to . Jack made his best alright . Listen . Go to scheme " À " please , maybe we 'll do something there . - Restoring , uncle Jack , restoring . - If only one draft would 've survived , all we got is our notes . Try to understand what is what . I think there is one man who could help a lot here . He is a worker . A radio technician . His name ... his name is ... Roy ! You are right . From our country 's point of view all these rewards are not enough for you . But the Future will give you more . You 'll see how the nation will meet you . Nation . The war is coming . In this condition it is necessary to produce the rUrs in a massive way . You know it , that there are only officers of the army working on our experimental factory . It seems like we have no other choice . There is a solution . We could use black people . It is safe , they won 't be interested in secrets . You are at your best , as usually ! We were not only repairing it , we were taking hold of it a little . One broken head made the other four work and think . No boasting , not now . It 's not the time yet ! Mister engineer had a long start over us , around a hundred points ahead . Here , take a look , the latest news . Shit ! My God , he 's huge ! Eh guys ... Surrender ? Surrender , you devils ? They have shut up , went sour . Eh , apologies for engineers . It 's not enough to understand " Micron " , one should take hold of these rUrs . There were only special department officers working on the secret factory . Attention ! Excuse me , a telegram from the government is received . They want to speed the things up with the manpower replacement . The thing is that the steel concern can provide you with any factory you want . The factory doesn 't matter , pick any . How about " Big Lights " ? This one is very close . " Big Lights " ? Suits me . " Big Lights " ... That 's even better . I 'll report to the government right away . Well-well , brother Jack . Let 's talk one more time . My friends , they want to make traitors of you . They think that you won 't support white workers . This is a secret military factory . They create mechanical soldiers against all the workers . The workers must get hold of control . We send this person to the factory . He looks like Rami and he 'll use his passkey . Not today . But when the military factories will go on strike , you will do the same thing . Sister ! I need to see you . Come visit me . I 'll be waiting near the highway across the post at 9pm . Yours , Jim . Jim , is that you ? Arrived with an unknown woman . Let 's check my machines . Radiowave control . rUr keeps his balance automatically and responds on hindrance . I am also able to see with his eyes using this television set . Jim ! Come on , relax , that was a joke . Some say that you are a traitor . I would like not to believe this . Well don 't . Don 't ! Stop this machine ! We have started a game of death . When they 'll try to get rid of me , I 'll command you to protect me . You hear ? ! You ! At the right moment Roy has made some changes . Let 's talk again , brother Jack . We 'll see who will get the victory ! When every ... every detail ... But no one even tries to understand ... Traitor ... Eh ? Traitor ? Traitor ? Eh ? Traitor ? Quickly , everything must be done before Roy comes . Today he 'll make an attempt to find out the secret of the main capacitor at the factory . And even if he fails , we 've almost reached our goal . We 'll find the secret ourselves . Bravo Jim ! Bravo ! I 'm not a traitor ! I 'M NOT A TRAITOR ! We have no doubt about it . Yeah , right ... - Got it ? - Got it . Look after the receiver Roy . The order will be given via the radio set . We have to pass the signal . Nearly half of all factories are on strike , people support us . And according to the Central Committee , others shall do the same as well . Send the biker in order to get in touch with the city committee . Strike-breakers , strike-breakers ! The armoured car has arrived . Hush ! I assure you , there 's no strike-breakers at all ! It 's a lie . Prove it then , if you can . Right ! Prove it ! We don 't believe it ! We 'll let the delegation in this unit . Just look at the worker future replacements . Nowadays they are kind . Long live Ripple ! Long live the Nation ! - The delegates are coming . - Look ! Engineer Ripple 's machines are working . I want to talk to the workers . Give the order . Today all of us are your rUrs . Let him speak . A matter of security . Pit , please try to remove the control point here . Quick march ! My friends . It is engineer Ripple who speaks to you ! Your Jim . You believe he is a traitor . But you are wrong . Don 't worry . Just listen to me . Here , I give you my hand , to let us go through new ways together , to build the new world in unity . Well , come to me . Don 't make fools of us . Charlie , it 's Jim . Just talk to him , will you ? Well hello there , dirty-nose . Where the devil are from ? Once an elephant tried to make friends with a mosquito . Is he alive ? My friends ! My friends , it is a mistake ! My friends , I didn 't want to ! - Now what the hell is going on ? - Bastards ! - They killed our Ripple ! Urgent radiogram . Cipher . The general strike has begun . In some blocks people tried to build the barricades some time ago . Your presence is necessary . Percy Grim . Do you know how to control ? Yes general . Only I know it . Yet only partly . In this case you better start working . Good luck . The wound is not very serious . It 's not the point . The fact itself shouldn 't remain without any redemption . We must finish with these villains . We will . The experiment goes on . Please follow me . Stop ! Stop ! Five killed , twelve wounded , except for Charlie . Send there two more picket groups . Calm all women , give signals to the nearest factories . The hand is damaged . Lost too much blood . Faint . Is it dangerous ? It 's not that serious . Stop ! Only accurate work will help us to intercept the control . We 'll define the main wave . And we will paralyze it . Then we 'll see who shall win . Smith ! The ground connection is in order ? In order . Raise the chain tension . They are very close ! The machines are near the village ! Alarm ! Take the guns and hide the kids . Jack , go and find out what 's happening there . Tell Roy to report to the city committee . Smith , check the ground connection . Contact . No hurry . Calm down . The machines are getting close to the village . Report to the committee . They are in the village already . Nice work . Clare , let us pass , we 'll carry Charlie in . I won 't go , I 'll stay here till the end . Calm down ! And hurry up ! Halt ! Stop ! Surrender ! Bastard ! They are getting back . Congratulations , gentlemen . They are attacking us general . It 's the workers . Where is my car ? After capturing the machines , the workers attacked . Gunners , attack the rUrs ... Fire ! The End subs by eball and Ilsasss

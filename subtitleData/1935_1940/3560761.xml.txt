 NEW MOSCOW Mosfilm 1938 Written and directed by Alexandr Medvedkin D. Sagal as Alyosha N. Alisova as Zoya M. Blumenthal-Tamarina as Grandma Moscow engineers working at the Vypinsk construction site invented a live model of Moscow . It 's a pity to cut off such a splendid beard . Trust me , it 's a pity . Leave my beard alone , can you ? Please , don 't cut it off . Many people in Moscow wear beards . Your beard will jeopardize the whole project , honey . No , Kozhevnikov , you can 't keep it . We can 't trust the model to such a beast . But many people in Moscow wear beards . Take Otto Schmidt , for example . Kozhevnikov , stop whining . Better memorize the procedure of switching it on . First , turn on the first two , then number four . Mosquitoes . But don 't touch number three . If you mix them up there will be an embarrassment . I won 't mix them up . After you deliver the model , arrange the construction and come back at once . Alright . Don 't be sorry for the beard , honey . It will grow again , even more hideous . Wait ! Don 't cut his beard . I have an important statement to make . I need to ask Kozhevnikov : Misha , did you tell the brigadier that you don 't plan to come back from Moscow ? Alyosha ! Did you tell him ? But I can 't stand these mosquitoes . I don 't have any more questions . Three thousand kilometers away from Moscow we are building this wonderful power station . But the engineer and hydrologist who was sent to dry the swamps is abandoning us . He can 't stand mosquitoes ! No more questions . You are not going . But my beard ... You are not going ! There you go . You can leave anytime . We won 't trust you with the model . Let 's send Alyosha . Right ! Why don 't you go too , and keep an eye on him , Grandma ? You 'll be the commissar . - How wonderful ! I 'll see Moscow . Alyosha is going to Moscow . " No matter how far I travel no matter which way I go I can see my dear capital and I hear the dear voice . Moscow sun shines brightly , its beams reach everywhere . No wonder that Madrid in Spain sings Moscow songs . " " Moscow inspires all of us , and teaches us how to live and work . Anyone who visited Moscow once will never forget it . " " There is the power of the people , this is where Stalin lives , He makes our joy even bigger . And everywhere , his heroism is calling us forward . " " No matter how much the enemy is plotting the war , and dreaming about the new gory way , he will never walk across our capital and our country . " " No matter how far I travel , no matter which way I go , I always see my dear capital and hear the dear voice . " What a great song ! This is what we sing about Moscow there , in the forests . What is your name ? Alyosha . Alyosha Konoplyannikov . I 'm an electrician . I am Zoya Novikova , we are going home from vacation . From a resort . I 'm very glad . Don 't you dare lose the teapot . Don 't worry . You can trust me with your teapot . Oh , Heinrich ! It 's the end of me . Please help me catch the piglet , comrade . Why tears ? I am a student at the Timiryazev Academy . I was bringing a specimen for my thesis . He is number thirteen in the record litter , with the best pedigree . What is your name ? Olya . I can 't believe my eyes . It 's a miracle ! There are no miracles , dear lady . This is electrical engineering , chemistry , mechanics and physics . Together with Alyosha we will make a live model of Moscow . A live model ? Will you also call it a miracle ? What do you mean ? A live model of Moscow ? Guys ! This must be for our exhibition . Grandma , where is your grandson ? Alyosha ! This one ? - No , I think , the other one . Or is it the other way around ? I think it 's this one . The train ! He missed the train , grandma . Dear lord ! The teapot ! Zoya 's teapot ! Don 't worry , you can trust me with a teapot . Why did you miss the train ? Because of you . Did you design your model for our exhibition ? How can you think of models now ? Moscow Why are you sighing , Grandma ? Of course I 'm sighing : my grandson missed the train Where am I supposed to look for him ? Meanwhile , a painter Fedya Utin was depicting disappearing corners of Moscow . This profession is complete misery . One day I paint it , the other day it 's nowhere to be found . Either they demolish it all , or build something new . Try to catch up with them . All of Moscow is upside down . Oh , pity me . Here is my sister 's house . Oh lord ! Are you serious ? Fine . It 's no longer my responsibility . Suit yourselves , see if I care . It 's not my business . We 'll sort it out ! We 'll find out who is in charge of the landscape . You are ruining my landscape ! You are a lowly bureaucrat ! You 'll take the blame for the landscape . Can 't you understand ? They are changing my subject . They are blowing up Gorky 's Street . Comrade , why did you tear off my button ? It 's nothing . I 'll get to you , my darlings . Yes , an invention for the exhibition . A live model of Moscow . The squares and the streets are all moving . What do you mean - ' what do I want ' ? Tell me where I can enquire . Do you have all the sketches and calculations for your model ? I have everything . It 's all clear . Grandma , can this model be built at the exhibition ? Of course , honey . That 's why we brought it . Grandma ! I am from the exhibition . My car is nearby , come with me . What about my luggage ? - We 'll take it too . What about my grandson ? - We 'll find him . Come on , come on . I 'll go with you . I can help as an artist . Alyosha arrived in Moscow with his new friends . 93 cents , minus the button . If I don 't deliver Heinrich on time , my life is finished . I have an uncle at the Arbat Street , he 'll help us out . Let 's go . They won 't let me in with the piglet . Are you sure ? - They won 't let me in . Yes , they will ! What 's wrong with your baby ? He is sick , he has mumps . Mumps ? Let me take a look , I am a pediatrician . What a charming face , though badly disfigured by the illness . It 's our stop . Our stop . Yes . There 's no doubt it is mumps . Besides , it 's a rare , practically hopeless case . It 's genius ! This invention is genius . This is technology . Yes , technology . After we find your grandson we 'll work on it day and night . You can live at my place , Grandma . Temporarily , that is . I am getting married , Grandma . Is she pretty ? She 's perfect . See for yourself , Grandma . I portrayed her exactly . And this is me . Zoya ! - Yes , her name is Zoya . Do you know her ? Take me to her , now ! We will find my grandson through her . Don 't worry , Grandma . We 'll see her tonight at the carnival . Tonight is a Carnival Night . Allow me to be your bear at the carnival . Unfortunately , I already have a bear . Your train ! The teapot ! - Hurry , hurry ! Good-bye . Shall I see your again ? I got it . Teapot ! Tonight is a Carnival Night . Wait here , Grandma . Don 't leave this bench . I 'll find Zoya , bring her here , and then we 'll find your grandson . " Moscow inspires all of us , and teaches us how to live and to work . Those who have been here at least once , will never forget it . " " No matter where I travel , no matter how far I go I always see my dear capital and hear my dear voice . " Grandma ! Either you put on a mask , or move over there . This is a masked area . I am not going anywhere from here , even if you kill me . Then put on a mask . Is this emergency room ? Very well . Help me , doctor . I am blinded by a blonde . What ? Treat her to some ice-cream ? Invite her to dance ? I 'm passing you to her , she 'll tell you what she wants . Yes ? Last time this blonde danced was during Alexander The Third 's rule . Zoya ! I am very nervous . Don 't pay attention at me . Zoya , I will never paint anything better than that picture of motherhood . I like children very much . I dream of them . I am awfully nervous . Be my wife , Zoya . What do you mean ? - Just this . Be my wife . Be my nearest and dearest , forever . Forever ? Sounds strange - - forever . Fedya , it will pass . Let 's go dancing . Zoya ! Answer me , or I won 't be responsible for my actions . How scary ! Let 's go . I 'm not going anywhere . Zoya , I was waiting for you , I prepared everything . Alyosha ! This is Alyosha . I am so glad ! Meet each other . Come on , greet him . I hate polar bears . Stay here . I 'll be right back , and we 'll go dancing . I can 't stand two polar bears around one girl . Thank you , but you are wrong . I am not another polar bear . Good-bye . My dear ! I am so glad . You know what ? Go ahead and leave . I am so glad ! Did you take offence ? - I did . So much that you won 't leave ? - So much that I won 't leave . Well , you are right . Then I will tell you everything . We look so alike . Help me get rid of one bear . How many do you have ? The problem is that I have two . Alright , give me your mask . Wonderful ! I am not a womanizer , I won 't stand in your way . I 'll do what I can to help you . One moment ! Silence ! - I 'm silent . With you , I 'll stay silent all my life . Ah , Zoya . And now , let 's go have fun and dance . I can 't stay silent . Say ' yes ' , or I 'll die . So soon ? Life is good , isn 't it ? Life is very interesting , Zoya . Alyosha , is it good to love and be loved ? Why are you silent ? I don 't want to give in to this magic night . Forgive me for my bluntness . You should not ask a stranger such questions . You 've got your bear . I 'll bring him here for you . Trust me , he 'll be happy to answer your questions . I 'll bring your bear . Why did she speak to me so gently ? Could it be that she does not love him ? Then , the words of love were for me ! To hell with polar bears ! There you are , Zoya . Why are you so sad ? Shall we dance ? Move closer . More affection . Finally , here 's the answer . That 's who I was sacrificed for . I see now . I won 't be a groom at this wedding . No , you won 't . We 'll get married , Zoya . Easy , easy , or you 'll strangle me . Marriage , Zoya , marriage . Listen . Until I fall in love with you I don 't want you to talk about marriage . But Zoya ... I 'll have none of that . How can I find them in such a Sodom ? My feet are giving in . Grandma ! - Zoya ! But where is my Alyosha ? Alyosha is here , Grandma . Let 's go . Alyosha ! - Grandma ! Hi Grandma ! Give me the dimensions for the pavilion . - What dimensions ? The exhibition committee is in the meeting right now . Give me those dimensions . The model is 10 by 20 , the audience hall has 2,000 seats . See you ! Good-bye ! For days and nights , the live model of Moscow was being constructed at the exhibition . It 's getting light . Alyosha , you haven 't slept for three days . Do you want me to drive you to your Grandma ? Alyosha ? He is sleeping . " My dear , you are asleep and you don 't know anything . You don 't know what joy you 've given me . You don 't know that I fell in love with you and I don 't dare say it . " You will leave Moscow soon , you won 't be back for a long time . But my heart will follow you and will always be with you . " " On dark nights and bright days I will share this joy with you knowing that that your hand is lighting up those golden lights in the faraway land . " " So what if you 're leaving , I won 't try to keep you . I will see you off myself . What I could not bring myself to say I will say some other time . " It 's getting light . Should I drive you to your Grandma ? Fedya is there . I couldn 't look him in the eye now . Fedya , Fedya ... What about him ? Let 's go then . I love you , Zoya . I cannot suppress this feeling anymore . You don 't need to suppress it . To lie to my comrades and stay in Moscow ? Forget it ! I 'll never even talk about it again . I never want to leave Moscow , and waiting is pointless . There is nothing to talk about . I see now . Look into my eyes . Come on ! Fedya , what 's wrong with you ? Leave me alone ! That means , you are staying in Moscow , Alyosha ? - No . That means , she will go with you ? - No . That means , you 'll break up ? - Yes . God damn you ! Why did get stuck between them two ? You deserve to be whipped with a belt . They thought they were sending a reliable man to Moscow . But this reliable man meddles in other people 's lives . That 's why you needed me as your commissar . But this is love , Grandma . There is no planning it ... Love , love ... Cool down , Alyosha . I 'll do my best , Grandma Where are you going ? Stop it ! Can 't . Don 't move the houses yet , I didn 't finish . Is twenty minutes enough ? I only need two days . Keep moving . You 'll answer for that ! I 'm almost done , anyway . Dear sister ! - I 've been looking for you all month . God almighty ! What 's going on ? Oh lord ! Where is Moscow going ? Where is our city moving ? Operator ? Where is Moscow moving ? You don 't know ? Maybe it 's just your room moving somewhere ? How is that possible ? The water is there , the lights are on , the phone works . We 'll lose Alyosha again . Sister , let 's run and catch up . - I need to pack up first . Take what you need most , take the samovar . Take the plant too . What 's the fuss , old ladies ? Where is Moscow moving ? This is our house being moved . One goes this way , the other goes that way , and the third will go to another street . Why are you moving houses like furniture ? First you 'll move the house , next you 'll shove the whole neighborhood into the suburb . Have you nothing better to do ? Frightening old people for no reason . Well , hello , dear sister . I came with my grandson , with Alyosha . Zoya ! I 'll try to forget you and remain your good friend . Please don 't torment Fedya who loves you more than life ... Alyosha ! Take me anywhere , even to the edge of the world . Living and building next to you is all I dream about , darling . Zoya . Fedya ! What are you doing to us ? - What 's wrong ? We 've been waiting for you all morning . No worries , here is Petrovka and Pushkin 's Square . Yesterday I submitted the Southwestern district . But where is Plyuschiha ? Where is it ? You had to submit it three days ago . I 've been asking for two assistants all this time . I can 't do it all myself . Ask the management for assistants . This is good . You are a real artist , Fedya . No , I 'm a failure . I 'm a big failure . I put all my soul into this picture of motherhood . But Zoya does not want to pose for it . She is avoiding me . This is great ! You are an amazing artist , Fedya . You must finish this picture . Then help me , Alyosha . Talk her into it . Okay . I can promise you that , Fedya . Well , not just that . Alyosha , don 't take it personally , but you are the main obstacle . Tell me , will you really go away after the model is completed ? I will really leave Moscow , Fedya . I 'm not standing in your way . Give me your hand . Comrade ! I swear , I 'll paint my Gioconda . Comrade ! Timofey ! Hi , how are you doing ? - Not bad . You look so much better now . Zoya , hi ! I will never be your Gioconda . Good-bye . What are you doing , Zoya ? - This is my letter . I slipped it in your pocket as a joke . But now it makes no sense . Zoya , you are a good comrade . Please , understand . You can 't go to the construction site , and I can 't stay in Moscow . It is dishonest to talk about love if the relationship has no future . And here you have an interesting artist . He 'll paint a wonderful picture of you . He loves you dearly . - What ? Are you trying to set me up with Fedya again ? It is my duty to do so . Oh yeah ? Bring Fedya . I 'll fall in love with him just to annoy you . Very well . I 'll bring him . How can one fall in love out of spite ? Ah , Zoya ... Gioconda ... I am sorry . I am so upset , I cannot think straight . Hey there , take off your shoes . Shoes ? He is so absent-minded . Why are you so upset ? Respond to the blows with a smile . This is very kind of you . Take me , for example . I always smile when I 'm upset . And it really helps . I strongly recommend this method to you . Thanks a lot . I envy your courage . Sit down . I can 't leave Moscow and not talk to you again . You will go with me . I 'll persuade you , I 'll kidnap you , I 'll bring you by force . You are insane ! - Sit down . I can 't leave Moscow knowing that I fell in love with a non-patriot . What ? Yes , our place is a backwater . Mosquitoes , dirty roads in autumn . You 'd have to wear your storm boots , but you will go with me , Zoya . Unless you lied to me when you talked about love ? I won 't go anywhere ! Then I have nothing to tell you . He loves me . Where absent-mindedness can take you . I 'll poke your eyes out , just you wait . Who is that ? Don 't be afraid , it 's just a scarecrow . Let 's sit down here . Kissing in public - shame on you both ! What a girl ! She could model as a happy mother . What femininity . It 's you ! - It 's me . It 's you ! I 'll poke your eyes out . I 'll kill you ! Meet the blows with a smile , I strongly recommend this method to you ! You deserve to die for your absent-mindedness . Does it hurt ? - It does . Go ahead and tell me , what upset you so much . Nothing special , actually . By the way , what is your name ? If only by the way ... My name is Olya . Olya . Please don 't think I 'm crazy . I 'll make a second Gioconda from you . Let go of me , madman . I am not a madman , but I 'm possessed . I will paint you as a happy mother . You 're just a madman . I need storm boots . Storm boots ? Alright . I need a ladies ' model . Storm boots don 't come in ladies ' models . I 'll take these . Comrade ! How dare you bring up love when the thesis committee is on their way ? This is not romance , this is nightmare . Go away ! You are sabotaging my thesis defense . Go away ! But I love you , Olya . I love you , Olya . Hear me out . No one in this life is more dear to me . Heinrich ! My Heinrich . My Heinrich ! He 's gone . My guinea piglet ! If you 're upset , I 'm upset . With you , I am ready to cry after some worthless piglet . Go away , leave me alone . What if I find him ? Then will you say yes ? How can you find him ? Calm down . Start your defense and I 'll bring him . Where is he ? Olya ! What are you doing ? It 's the wrong one . Heinrich is this small , and look what you brought . This small ? Coming up . So much can be done to win the heart of a beloved girl . Masterpieces of art , moonscapes , poetry ... Even heroism . And I have to find some confounded piglet . Obviously , I am a failure . Here he is ! What luck ! You saved my thesis . Oh , dear Heinrich ! Tomorrow , at noon . Today is the opening of the live model of Moscow . Excuse me . Let me through . Can 't you see what 's going on ? Can 't you wait ? Excuse me , we are late . I am late too . We all are late . Oh , I 'm so sorry . We can 't wait anymore . Something must have happened to him . You - - can you control this model ? I 'm not sure . Please . Comrades , we are sorry . There was an error . The model is moving backwards . How can it be ? Moscow is going back in time . Please , stop it ! Look , a convent . Stop it ! What are you doing ? Stop it ! While accomplishing Stalin 's plan for the reconstruction of Moscow Bolsheviks did a colossal job . Old buildings are blown up opening the stretches of future boulevards . Today 's Moscow is one giant construction site . New buildings are growing faster and faster , like in a fairy-tale . Gorky Street , Kirov Street , Dzerzhinskaya , Pushkinskaya , Chkalovskaya ... In 1938 alone , five new bridges connected the banks of Moscow river . Crimea Bridge . Where the river Himka used to flow , in the place of the old brick factory Himka river port was erected . Now , comrades , take a look at what Bolsheviks will do to Moscow tomorrow . New train station highway . Boulevard of Academy of Sciences . Mayakovsky Square . Pushkin Square . Revolution Square . Behind Lenin Hills , in the direction of Kuntsevo and Tsaritsino a new district will be built - - the Southwestern District . Our Moscow subway will link this new giant city with the downtown . Moscow embankments will become the best architectural ensemble of the capital . New boulevards , beautiful streets and squares . Exquisite buildings will make our Moscow an unbelievably beautiful city . Lenin Boulevard Soviet Palace Soviet Palace is a symbol of the power and greatness of our motherland . This plan for this reconstruction was proposed by the great Stalin ! He is gathering countless armies of Bolshevik builders under his banner . Comrades . Comrades ! I am not the only inventor . This model was designed by a team of Moscow engineers from Vypinsk construction site . Even in a far-off forest we still love our dear Moscow . We 'd like to participate in its gigantic reconstruction . The hearts and the thoughts of young patriots are reaching out to our beautiful capital . But we also love our construction site , comrades , no less than we love Moscow . A Soviet person is most happy where our blossoming motherland needs him the most . Late night I love my swamp . We are turning it into a most beautiful city . And now ... Don 't go , Alyosha . Don 't go . Just think of it - - we 'll live in Moscow , right in the downtown . We 'll have a balcony , gas ... If you want , I 'll cook cabbage pies for you . Do you like them ? I like cabbage pies . But I also like curd tarts . Curd tarts , cabbage pies - - anything you want . You know , I also want to buy a good radio . That 's right . By the way , I just saw an ad for it in the Evening Moscow . Let 's buy it , Zoya ? There 's a letter . Who is it from ? Read it to me . Come on , read it . A lock of hair . A blonde ! " Take this lock as a souvenir for the perished beard . Kozhevnikov . " Zoya , I am leaving for the construction site tomorrow . Forgive me , but I won 't stay in Moscow . I will never see Moscow again . I wish I could jump off the train , hop on the subway , then on the bus ... I 'd run along Arbat for twenty years non-stop . Hey , Commissar . Why don 't you stay , Grandma ? Why do you have to go ? Alyosha ! I might as well get off . Hold my luggage . Hurry , Grandma . Good-bye , Grandma . - Good-bye , Alyosha . Write often . Good bye ! Old hag ! So much for the commissar . Shame on me . Grandma ! - Zoya ! Are you going with Alyosha ? I 'm late . It 's the end . What is the end ? Why should you cry over the train ? Forgot about the plane ? The plane ? - Yes . Where is that swamp ? Who remembers now ? I dried all the swamps . What about the mosquitoes ? Are there mosquitoes ? Extinguished . Hey , friend ! - Hello , Alyosha ! It can 't be true . This would be too simple . Is there flour ? - Flour ? What for ? The glue ! Bring the glue . We 'll paste it back . I need to compare . Excuse me , I don 't want to paste the beard back . Don 't you understand how important it is ? Hey , friend ! - Hi there ! Congratulations ! Don 't congratulate me . I was not the only inventor . I 'm bringing the bonus from People 's Commissar for the whole team . You 've built so much while I was away ! You thought we were only chasing mosquitoes here ? Remember ? Seems like you 're not lying . It means I made her up myself . I am so silly . Forgive me for my stupidity . People in love are always a little stupid . Let 's clean it up . They are coming ! Alyosha is coming ! Ladies , hide ! Zoya , hide in the wardrobe . Misha ! You grew a beard again ! My whole life would be different if not for your facial hair . What 's this ? I pulled this one out too ! I need a doctor ! I have an important statement to make . I need to ask Alyosha a question . What is your best wish now ? I want us to build well , like they build Moscow . Got that . What else do you want ? I also want some cabbage pies . Got that ! What else ? And ... also I like curd tarts . Got them too . Anything else , Alyosha ? Enough already . There are many things I want . What are you , a genie in a bottle ? I am a magician , an ancient wizard . I swear I 'll give you what you want , right here , right now . Ah , magician ... Because of your magic beard I lost the one ... Bring her to me ! Nina ? No . Masha ? No . Zoya ? Yes . How do you know ? Zoya ! - Alyosha ! Everyone , dinner is ready . Comrades ! Friends ! Our Moscow has become so beautiful . The monuments of our wonderful days will be there for centuries . Subway , canals , factories , houses . We live well . We love well , and we build well . We won 't submit to anyone . Comrades ! My friends ! I can 't speak . I want to sing . " No matter how far I travel no matter where I go I always see my dear capital and hear my dear voice . Moscow sun shines brightly , its beams reach everywhere . That 's why even Madrid in Spain sings Moscow songs . No matter what the enemy is plotting , what gory schemes he has in mind , he will never reach our capital and our country . There is the power of the people , Stalin lives there and makes our joy brighter . His heroic deeds call us forward . " THE END [ Subtitles by invidia for KG ]

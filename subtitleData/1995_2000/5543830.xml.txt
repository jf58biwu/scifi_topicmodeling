 92 degrees . God ! I want a drink but I can 't be bothered to get up . I wanna go to the loo but I can 't be bothered to go down the corridor . This is one of the universal dilemmas , something which has confronted all men since the beginning of time . To pee or not to pee , that is the question . No , I 'll just lie here really thirsty with a full bladder and try and get to sleep . Smeggin ' hell ! One more time and you get this . Do you hear ? Don 't think I don 't mean it . One more time . Just one more . ( PIPE GURGLES ) What did I tell you ? Didn 't I tell you ? How many times have I told you ? Right . What was the last one ? " Nureek . " So the next one will be a " rotut " , and the one after that will be a " hernunger " . Four seconds , three seconds , two seconds ... ( ROTUT ! ) Now " hernunger " . ( NUREEK ! ) No , that 's wrong . You 've gone out of sequence . " Nureek " , " rotut " , " hernunger " . What 's wrong with you ? If you 're gonna keep me up all night , just do it right , OK ? ( SQUELOOKLE ! ) " Squelookle " ? Where does " squelookle " come from ? He 's new ! ( WATER HISSES ) Oh , that 's better . Kill two birds with one shower . Oh ! OK ... Right , right . I can 't hear you . You can do whatever you like . I can 't hear a damn thing . ( NUREEK ! ) Oh , my goodness . It 's Princess Leia . Mr Skywalker went that way , ma 'am . - What ? - It 's 1 a.m. , ma 'am . What are you doing up ? Looking for someone to kill . Volunteering ? Oh , can 't sleep ? Have you ever listened to those old pipes ? Nureeking and rotuting and just when you expect them to nureek again , they squelookle ! It 's enough to make a perfectly sane person crazy ! It 's amazing how many people those pipes have driven to the brink of psychosis . Mr Lister spent the night in there and tried to suffocate himself with a sandwich . Look at this . This is a boys ' fridge . Women would never have fridges like this . Chilled trainers ? It just wouldn 't happen ! What would you say to some drinking chocolate ? I 'd say , " Drinking chocolate , get me out of here ! " I can 't live like this . I need a bath . I 've always hated showers . Ask anyone what I hate and you know what they 'd say ? - You hate showers ? - See ? Even you know and you hardly know me ! I need a bath . I need sleep . I need clothes . I need cottage cheese with pineapple in . I 'm sure the next Space Corps ship we find will have supplies . I knew when I joined the Corps it would be tough in deep space . I accepted shopping was unlikely . But then I lost my crew , my ship and I ended up here with a fridge full of trainers , two sets of clothes and pipes that squelookle when they should nureek ! I mean , I 've tried , I really have tried to fit in ! I even tried learning what offside was . - Oh ... - ( SOBS ) Ma 'am , please . I 've never had to comfort a crying woman before . I 'm not familiar with the technique . Er , hang on . Just processing . ( BLEEPS ) Oh , I see ! Oh , well , don 't worry , ma 'am . I know the drill now . - Huh ! - What are you doing ? ! Get off me ! The Heimlich manoeuvre , ma 'am . It helps women stop crying . The Heimlich manoeuvre stops people choking ! No , I think you 're wrong , ma 'am . Huh ! You 've just got a corrupted file in your database ! - Well , why have you stopped crying ? - It 's really hard to cry when someone 's doing the Heimlich manoeuvre on you . - It really puts you off . - But you 're not crying , though . Well , no . - So it worked . - No ! It didn 't work ! It just ... Oh , shut up ! Shut up ! Shut up ! ( EXASPERATED ) Oh ! Where did it all go wrong ? My life started off so promisingly . Rich parents , good school , pony named Trumper . How did I end up like this ? On a ship where the fourth most popular pastime is watching my knickers spin dry . Oh , ma 'am ! No one has ever done that ! Because they don 't know when you wash them . One trailer before " The World 's Stupidest Stuntmen " video and that laundry room will be packed ! I think you 're doing Mr Lister and the Cat a great disservice , ma 'am . Wow ! This is the best load yet . Just for the record , I 'm only here because I can 't sleep . - I 'm doing some laundry to help Kryten . - Yeah , yeah , yeah . I 'm not here because I 'm a sad person who 's entertained by women 's underwear spin-drying . - My God ! A G-string ! - Where ? You missed it . I swear ! It was black and really really small . I 'm too mature for this . I 'm gonna read my comic . Oh , this is a great show tonight . I may write a fan letter to the manufacturers . Sometimes I 'm ashamed to be with you . You 're completely out of order . - Since when did you get so mature ? - Mature ? I 've been mature for ages , me . - Oh , yeah ? - Yeah . You 're just pretending to be mature to get Officer Bud-Babe to fall for you ! - Everybody knows that ! - Go stick an egg up your nose . - It 's true . - Isn 't true . - It is . Is ! Is ! - It isn 't . Isn 't ! Isn 't ! Sirs ! What are you arguing about ? - About me being really mature . - Sir , why aren 't you in bed ? The heating system 's gone bonkers . Why ? What 's up ? Life on board ship is getting Miss Kochanski down , sir . She 's in the midships now , shouting abuse at the fridge for not having any low-fat yoghurt . - What 's the problem ? - Her quarters are by the sewage processor . - You know how noisy those pipes are , sir . - We 'll relag them tomorrow . It 's not just that . It 's everything . Not being able to have a bath , no cottage cheese , no c ... The thermostat ! I swear I set the correct programme ! Oh ! Who on earth is going to tell her ? I mean , who ? - Hi . - ( GRUNTS ) How are you settling in ? Great . Having a ball . - We 'll get you some more clothes . - Don 't worry . I can wear a sheet for the next 50 years . I 'll be fine . - We 'll fix those pipes . - If you could just make them go " nureek " without any " squelookles " , I 'd be so grateful . - We 'll stop them completely . - I 'm not used to this , not having stuff . When I was 15 , my brother used to kidnap my lipstick and hold it to ransom . If I didn 't look good I wouldn 't go out . If I don 't look good , I don 't feel good . How do you feel now ? - ( WHIMPERS ) - Don 't answer that . I know I 've been spoilt , brought up in the trendiest part of Glasgow . - Yeah , the Gorbals . You said . - Eleven years in cyberschool , perfect computer-generated setting , with perfect CG teachers and perfect CG friends . Now I can 't even have a bath . Come on . Come with me . I 've got something to show you . You take my quarters tonight , and I 'll have yours . I filled an old retro housing with water . - I don 't know what to say ... - And I , um ... found this on that derelict . I was saving it for your birthday . There 's some make-up in there , too . I can 't find her , sir . I 've been searching high and low . Oh ! Ma 'am . I didn 't spot you there . - Kris is sleeping here tonight . - In your quarters , sir ? - Yeah , she 's gonna have a nice hot bath . - In here ? Without clothes on ? Well , convention dictates probably , yeah . Kryten , me and Kris have been having a talk , and we think it 'd be better if you leave . - Sir ? - We 're planning on settling down together . It started that night she had a bath in my quarters , remember ? We got you this leaving present . - A keyring . - With a " C " on it . - For Kryten . - But you spell Kryten with a " K " . Oh , don 't make a fuss . Now , I 've packed all your heads . They 're in the bag . You know what it 's like , man . You settle down with a woman , and they systematically set about getting rid of your mates . - Cat 's next . - I 've been packing his bag for weeks . We want to be a proper couple and have dinner parties , and I think I really should be wearing clogs . We 're a bit embarrassed of your funny-shaped head . - You 're not human , are you . You 're a robot . - Yeah ! - Oh , hi ! You 're early . Come in ! - Great to see you ! Mwah ! Mwah ! I 've just seen the future ! Mr Lister shrunk your uniform , ma 'am . - You only have one now . - Never mind . - Aren 't you mad ? - I 'm too tired . I just want a bath and some sleep . Right . I 'll be going , then . After all these years , I 'll be going . - Are you all right , Kryts ? - Never been better , sir . A keyring with a " C " on it ! Unbelievable ! Thank you with a capital " R " ! - What 's eating him ? - I dunno . I 'll find out later . Thanks for this . I really appreciate it . - Hey , no bother . - See you in the morning . Right . - Well , I 'll be going , then ... - Yeah . Night . Right , I 'll ... I 'll go . - Yeah . - See you tomorrow . Right . If you need anyone to scrub your back or anything , don 't hesitate to call . - I won 't . - Night , then . - Night . - Night . Night-night . ( BOOM ) What was that ? Hang on a minute . I 've got a torch . - What the hell 's happening ? - The generator 's down , sir . I was adjusting the thermo-settings and it overloaded . In a few seconds , the emergency back-up will kick in . - ( HUMMING ) - Ah , thank goodness . I 'll look into it immediately , sir ! ( BUZZING ) There goes the back-up ! Now everything 's dead . - How come the doors closed ? - When the back-up goes , the doors lock . Prevent fire , reinforce hull integrity . So what 's steering this crate ? Is autopilot down too ? Everything 's down . I wish I 'd been more careful ! You mean this ship 's careening through space with zero expertise at the helm ? No change there , then . We 've got to refire the back-up generator . - That 's through the service ducts . - The what ? Two miles of ventways that wind through the ship . There 's a hatchway in your shower . - How long will that take ? - Six hours . - Six hours ? ! - Are you OK , sir ? Fine , yeah ! Ahem ... Yeah . Yeah . The reading last night said a meteor storm was coming in , but it won 't hit us for 12 hours . We should gather up some supplies , food and water , and maybe even that magnetic fishing game . OK , let 's go . It 's so damn hot , it 's like being stuck in a sauna with a fat man on your face . I don 't feel so good . The walls are closing in ! - Are you OK , sir ? - I need air ! He 's claustrophobic . Didn 't you guys know ? I 'm all right when I know I can get out , but now we 're out in the middle ... - I can 't breathe ! - Have a drink , sir . OK , take a look around . See if we can unscrew a ceiling hatch , drop back into the ship . - Let 's go . - My throat 's closing . - I 'm choking . - Drink this . You just need to take your mind off it . I wonder why Dave - my Dave - wasn 't claustrophobic . Oh , thanks , Kris . That 's really helping . It 's not a good time to hear how great your boyfriend is . He wasn 't my boyfriend . Not really . - What ? - No , we were just good friends . - No , but you said ... - I didn 't want to look like a sad loser , so I asked him to play along . - You weren 't going out with him ? - He wasn 't my type . But he was well-dressed , neat , sophisticated , sensitive ... You 're so damn picky ! Why wasn 't he your type ? - He was gay . - You see ? Picky . They have to be absolutely perfect before you 're int ... - What did you say ? ! - He was gay . - Gay ? - Yes . I 'm gay in an alternative dimension ? - Yes . - Me ? That 's why we didn 't date long . It was his final attempt at working things out . Wait a minute . You don 't think ... Now , hang on . I 'm completely straight , OK ? I couldn 't possibly be gay . I can 't grow a big moustache for starters . - It just grows in little clumps . - Dave , shut up . - I 'm just saying . - I really miss him . He was great . Sometimes we used to go to bed together , and he 'd just hold me . - Made me feel everything was OK . - Really ? Well , actually ... What am I thinking of ? I am not gay ! - Don 't make a big deal about it ! - But I 'm not ! Before the accident , I had loads of gay friends . - So did I. - Yeah ? - Yeah . - Friends that you were close to ? - Yeah ! - Name one . OK , what about ... Bent Bob ? Bent Bob ? ! Yeah , little guy , bad toupee , used to work in catering . That 's what you called him , is it ? " Hey , Bent Bob ! How 's it going ? " It was his nickname . It was affectionate . Obviously , we only used it behind his back . Played poker . Nice bloke . - He was a really good friend ? - All right , I haven 't had many gay friends . Yes , you have . You just haven 't known they were . - Like who ? - Well , I can only speak for my reality , but on our ship , Todd Hunter . - Todd Hunter ? - Yeah . - He was married . He had kids . - So ? - He slept with women . - That doesn 't mean anything . Yes , it does ! Hang on a minute . This is garbage , isn 't it ? You made it up to take my mind off this ! You 're not really a sad loser after all , are you ? God , I found that really attractive , as well . Made me feel all superior and macho . Not that I don 't usually feel macho . Here , have another drink ... heteroboy . So , your Dave ... isn 't , is he ? Ah , smeg ! We 've found a grille about 20 metres down which drops down into a supply room . We can 't get through to unscrew the bolts , but with smaller hands you might have better luck . - Will you be OK ? - Leave him to me . I 'll be OK . Drink ? Boy , is it cramped ! Whoo-ee ! If I was dead , you could not swing me around in here ! - Cat ... - Talk about cooped up ! Cat ! Oh , sorry . Not supposed to talk about that , right ? Right . How come you 're claustrophobic ? Were you born that way or are you kind of sissy ? - Sissy . - Yeah ? Yeah . Now can we just change the subject , please ? How comes you didn 't get it when we was in that tunnel ? I don 't always get it ! Just when I know that I can 't get out . Maybe it 's something to do with blood sugar . But how come you get it at all , though ? I was 17 , working in the megamart part-time as a trolley-parker . After a couple of months , I fell in love with cashier number four . She was 22 , with come-to-behind-the-bacon-counter eyes . Something about the way she held her pricing gun made me crash me trolleys . We started seeing each other in the stockroom at break time . She gave you claustrophobia ? I didn 't think you could get it like that . No . She was married to this bald bloke who served the fish , ten years older than her . He was more interested in his amateur dramatics group than her . One evening , we snuck into the stockroom and started making love on a box of tinned asparagus . After a few minutes - about halfway through , I was 17 - she said , " There 's someone at the door ! " I jumped into this wooden crate . It was him ! He asked what the hell she was doing lying on a box of reduced tinned veg with no kit on . She said she was trying to get an all-over tan from the light bulb . He sealed me up in the box and said he was gonna drop me in the canal . I was screaming at him , pleading , " Let me out ! " I promised him anything , said I 'd never see her again , just let me out ! In the end , he relented , and I heard the box being opened . I stepped out ... bollock naked ... right in the middle of an amateur production of " The Importance of Being Earnest " . Boy , that 's enough to freak anyone out ! I had no idea Mr Lister was claustrophobic . It 's probably not something he 's comfortable talking about . - He 's told me about everything else . - Not everything , Kryten . - Absolutely , ma 'am ! - Everything ? Before you arrived , nights were long and dull . Cheese slice snap can only entertain so long . So what did he tell you about me ? Oh , absolutely everything , ma 'am . Every single detail . You mean he told you ... about the rusty gate ? That was one of the first things he told us . - We all had a good laugh ! - He told you that ? That I make a sound like a rusty gate when I 'm making love ? No , he told us his grandma once had a rusty gate , and he helped fix it . And that gave you a good laugh ? Well , like I say , nights were long and dull . We were glad of the anecdote . So he didn 't ? OK . I never said that . Allow me a second , ma 'am . Just cross-filing that story under " B " for blackmail , and sub-category " S " for " so funny you 'll laugh till you 're sick " . Look , wig-stand-head , me and Dave , it 's all in the past . So why does he look at you like a starving man looks at a pack of peanuts ? - Well , it 's because ... - Because he wants to get the wrapper off and taste the salty goodness ! - That 's his problem . - And the way you look at him ? - What way ? - I 've seen it ! - What way ? - Like he 's cottage cheese with pineapple ! How can you say that ? ! I have never looked at him like he 's cottage cheese with pineapple ! Maybe , once or twice , plain cottage cheese , but never ever with pineapple . Never . Never ! Have I ? - What 's that ? - What 's what ? Can 't you hear it yet ? Like a ... roaring noise . A roaring noise ? Like a ... watery kind of roaring noise . I can 't hear a thing . It 's like water roaring down , say ... a passageway ... in a kind of roaring , watery kind of way . I wonder what the hell it is . - Hey , where are you going ? - Kris ! Kryten ! Recyc water ! Every four hours , the ducts get backwashed ! I think I just solved the watery roaring noise problem . - Come on ! - I ain 't going with you ! - Why not ? - That 's where the water 's coming from . You can be really dumb sometimes , you know that ? ( WATER ROARING ) I hate this ! I really hate this ! - What 's that ? - What ? - That noise . - Oh , not again ! What noise ? Is it a roaring , watery noise ? No , not that noise . This is a different kind of noise . Is it a " Cat being smacked on the head by a smegged-off Lister 's fist " kind of noise ? It 's a sort of ... swirly ... windy ... water-drying , hurricaney kinda noise ! A swirly , windy , water-drying , hurricaney kind of noise ? The dryer ! The vents get dried after the backwash ! - ( WHOOSHING ) - Here it comes . Whooooaaa ! I am not having a good day ! This should take away the rising panic . - What is it ? - We found a first-aid box . Lemoplathinominecatholyrite . Well done , ma 'am . Well , everything considered , we 've made good time . What if we have to eat each other like those dudes from that plane crash ? Those were exceptional circumstances . Their only other choice was airline food . - It won 't happen to us . - Good . I could never eat a person . No way I could cook one , not without my slow cooker . - What about drinking your own urine ? - That 's out of the question . You never serve urine with white meat . I hate the dark . It reminds me of being back in the orphanage school . The dorm was always pitch black . The tight sods didn 't allow so much as a night-light , to save electricity . One night , the lights went out and , as usual , Squeaky Gibson 's bed started up . Squeak ! Squeak ! Squeak ! Squeak ! Squeak ! We all threw our shoes at him . " Shut up , Gibson ! We 're trying to sleep ! " Anyway , we all settled back down , and after a while his bed started up again . Squeak ! Squeak ! Squeak ! Squeak ! Squeak ! More shoes , boots , trainers , everything . He just got faster and faster . Squeak ! Squeak ! Squeak ! Squeak ! Squeak ! So I got up , snapped on the light , and there under a mountain of shoes was poor old Squeaky having an epileptic fit . I managed to wedge one of my trainers into his mouth . Probably saved his life . Cyberschool was so different . We 'd arrive on the first day of term , put on our total immersion suits and connect to the mainframe . Suddenly , there we 'd be in a perfect replica of a girls ' boarding school . We had Miss Brody for English , Mr Chips for maths . For history , they brought in Disraeli and Genghis Khan . For literature , they let us talk to Shakespeare and Dickens . I can 't wait to hear about sex education class . At 18 , when I got out , I went off the rails . - How off the rails ? - There are the rails . There 's me . That 's way off the rails . - So ? What did you do ? - You name it . - No , you name it . What did you do ? - Well ... - Yeah ? - You want me to write you a list ? Yeah . OK , I , er ... Well , I smoked cigarettes sometimes . I wore skirts that were quite short . - I went to the library and was really noisy . - Really ( ? ) No , not really . I was in real life for the first time . No protectors . I went insane . - Really ? - Yeah . I was a retro-punk . ( ALL ) Wow ! They say the hardest part of leaving cyberspace is realising the universe does not revolve around you . Sure doesn 't . It revolves around me . - Absolutely . - No , I 'm serious . Look at the evidence . What evidence ? Take food . Until I bite into it , it has no taste . Even knowing what I 'm gonna say never bores me . - You and you alone . - And here 's the clincher . All the interesting things that happened to me happened when I was there . Coincidence ? Get outta here ! By my reckoning , we should be halfway across B-deck now . Boy , is this place hot ! Satan could come here on his winter break ! Hang on . How come it 's getting hotter when the generators have packed in ? - It should be getting colder . - Ma 'am , that meteor storm , what direction was it in ? - Dead ahead . - Anything else in the vicinity ? - There 's a sun , but that 's it . - We 've been knocked off course , probably due to the generators going down . We 're heading straight into that sun ! And it 's all my fault ! - Kryten , it 's not your fault . - It is ! It isn 't ! You were just adjusting the thermosettings and it overloaded . I did it on purpose . I typed in the override code on the access panel . What ? ! I didn 't realise it would be so dangerous ! - Kryten , what made you do it ? - I really can 't remember ... - What do you mean , can 't remember ? - I 'd rather not say . - It might sound a bit silly . - Say it . I didn 't want you to have a bath , ma 'am . Well , it would be one of those " no-clothes " baths , and Mr Lister would scrub your back , and before we know it , he 's wearing clogs and you 're having Gelfs round to dinner . And what would happen to me ? I 'd be on my own again ! - Oh , Kryten ! - ( WHINES ) I was just so scared ! - Let 's get out of here . - We 're not going to make it ! - We are ! - How ? We 're gonna catch some surf ! - OK , here it comes . - So how do you hang ten ? Just get into position ! Here it ... ( EVERYONE SCREAMS ) ( CRASH ) ( SCREAMING ) Oh ! Thank God we made it ! Oh , God ! ( THUD ) How ? How ? I , er ... I , ah , er ... Oh . That 's it . We 're fried , unless someone 's got some terrific sunblock cream . Not necessarily , ma 'am . I excluded the doors from the shutdown override - in case ... ( SQUEAKS ) anything happened . - ( DOOR HUMS ) You mean we spent the night crawling through this ship for absolutely no reason ? It was all pointless ? You put me through that nightmare when we could just walk out ? Well , we 've got some serious reversing to do . We 'll talk about this over a cup of coffee and a hot branding iron . - Well , night . - Aren 't you mad , too , ma 'am ? You 're not , are you ? I think I understand . For you , the trek was far from pointless . It was an emotional journey where you gleaned invaluable insights into your crewmates . This was your rites of passage . You feel wiser and bonded by this in a way that you never thought possible . - Say " nureek " . - Nureek . - Say " rotut " . - Rotut . - Say " hernunger " . - Hernunger . - " Nureek . " - Nureek . - " Rotut . " - Rotut . - " Hernunger . " - Hernunger . - " Squelookle . " - Squelookle . - " Rotut . " - Ooh ! Rotut . - " Nureek . " - Ooh ! Nureek . - " Hernunger . " - Hernunger . " Squelookle . Nureek . Rotut ... " ( SONG ) It 's cold outside , there 's no kind of atmosphere I 'm all alone , more or less Let me fly far away from here Fun , fun , fun In the sun , sun , sun I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose Drinking fresh mango juice Goldfish shoals , nibbling at my toes Fun , fun , fun In the sun , sun , sun Fun , fun , fun In the sun , sun , sun

I acted like a jerk because of everything that happened . - It 's all in the past . - It hurt . - I know . - I missed you . - And I was thinking about you . - I think I know what happens . - What ? This is not just a physical reality . There are our feelings . These cameras can be controlled . - What do you mean ? - Whatever this place change what we feel , from room to room . In the room where my name appeared with blood We blame each other for what went wrong , but now I feel stupid laughing . I feel stupid . Where prophecy led me ... The weapon will fall on cities , if thieves will save mankind from pain . Prophecy ? I do not understand ! We are here to find the gun to steal , but it 's not . No ? - That 's weapon . We weapon . I have no idea what you mean . But no matter how happy I feel now , you should get out of here . - We should go . - We have to go to find Richie . What happens ? Arsenal would not be here . - It does not make sense . - I do not think that should be logical . Ritchie ? Hey , Ritchie , are you okay ? Hey , man . May depend on the place ... I 'll die here .

I was jealous for a while . After that I went . Or so I thought . - Ritchie , listen to me ! - And the last shot I gave the bar . The police came and I panicked , man . I have not reconciled to the thought that I will go to jail and I left . - It 's okay . - It 's not . You told me , man ... tell me how your stepfather 're locked in the cellar , and how you could not sit in the dark . What am I doing ? I left you locked in the dark for two years . Two years in prison for the best friend I 've ever had . - Please Richie , give me the gun . - I never forgave . I never forgave . Ritchie ! - Harley , gotta get out of here fast . - You really do not care ? - Of course I care . - I need a minute with him . We do not . Chamber did . Do not you understand ?

It 's my fault , Ritchie . I was upset . I could not forget . Damn ! - Why would anyone do that ? - Are tested . Who ? Who is testing us ? Harley , I was disgusted to say that all men , that I think I 'll vomit . If you think , well , if not , and it 's good . This este ? We tested to armed alien invasion . - Aliens ? - He was a prophet named Nostradamus . Prophecies are clues that will out of here . Nostradamus ? A verse from the prophecy says : The enemy is the triumph of intellect necessary to defeat a new meaning . Do not you understand ? What do you think about ? I think it refers to how these affect our minds rooms . - We have to move . - Why ? The longer we stay in this room , so are more likely to affect us . You run from room to room , like rats in the maze ? If that 's a maze , it is a way out . You must tell me all the details about how you got the job . As Richie said , I got a job at the new guy . It 's called Weaver . Recommendations have been checked . He gave us the plans , plane tickets , cash in advance and a briefcase . - Briefcase ? - Yes , a Halliburton briefcase . - What was in the briefcase ? - Plans . I do not remember . Neither do I. - I put the briefcase on the table . - We had to take the plane that night . Yes , we met a few hours before the flight . - Yes , on the corner of Halsted Belmont . - Ritchie is rented hideout . - I opened the briefcase . - And then ? And then ? Try not to inhale . Hurry ! Damn ! - What ? What happened ? - I cut my finger . This e ? How did we get here ? We are here . That 's all that matters . - Harlie , asta nu e real . - Mie mi se pare real . - Why did you do it ? - What ? Why have you forsaken me . - I had to go . - Why ? - As we do not destroy each other . - That was the charm . What did she and I could not offer me ? What ... - Her name was Hannah . I did not mean to hurt you , Harlem . When I got out of prison , they gave me an officer supervisor who had a daughter , Hannah . It made me want to give up on life , inspired me to live honestly . I have lived honest with you , but you never said . There was a choice . I fell in love . No . You destroyed me . You were the first in my heart , Harlem . That will not ever change . I hope you 'll forgive me . Did you miss me ? - I thought you were dead . Only in your mind . - You scare me . I 'll do more than scare you , whore . Harlem , I see ! I see nothing . I got ? Where is it ? - He disappeared . Harlem , are blind . How to get out of here if you do not see ? No break locks eyes . - Damn ! - Calm down ! - I can not calm . - Please , relax ! Harlem , are helpless . Without regard can not do anything . Helpless . Helpless ? - What ? This place plays with our minds . So you said . Richie mention that you were locked in the cellar and how helpless you feel . Do not you understand ? It plays with our minds . We read . That does not help me . Harlem , I see ! But you can still break the locks . Come on ! You have not lost skill , only to . From what I can tell , we 're going in circles . You said that we must move continuously . As long as we move , we 're safe . - Damn ! - What ? It has sharp edges . One another ... Harley , that is . Check other locks that have sharp edges . - Why ? - Please , just check . - Smooth . - What about the other ? The fel . No . - E model , Harlem . It 's what I was looking for . - How do you know ? - I 'm not sure . But the other ... some had sharp edges and others do not . - Worth a try . - Okay . - Let me first I go . - You want to protect me ? All right ! Harlem , I can see . - What do you think that means ? - For failure is necessarily a new meaning . I was blind , but found tactile model . That prophecy says . We must trust the other senses . We must be on the right track . Maybe its rewards right choice . Check other locks that have sharp edges . Here . That 's it . Who the hell is that ? - It 's my buddy , Eddie . - The machine you read again . - Just another nightmare . - Now try to scare us . - Has effect . Let 's check doors . Girls and boys suffering from mumps ... We twisted the ends and now they 're assholes ! Do not give him attention and go and look for another door . Mimi ascut cuţitul ... Ascut toporişca children dissect it into two pieces and cover them with wax . - When I was little , I always hope . - Do not listen to him . Do not let it get to you . Scared girl . Come on . What the hell ? A white room with no doors . - There is no escape . No way out . - They like to play with our minds . All right . I feel left ? Hearing , sight , taste , touch ... You are brilliant . - What do you mean ? When I was blind , I relied on other senses . Now they no longer have , I have to rely on something else . - I do not know what you mean . - The sixth sense , sense again . I do not understand . Remember what he said Dex ? " Only in your mind . " - Da - . Asta and full . We gotta get out of my mind to get out of here . Foster ! You 're not real . We can get out of here , Harlem . This maze is used for memories , feelings and our fears . Since we 're stuck in a room without doors . Car listened when I talked to Richie I felt helpless in the dark . - A nightmare recreated . Right . - We already know that . How will this help us get out of here ? The car reacts to us we must do to respond to us . We create a way out . I already did . When I was looking at Richie , you had a hunch , an intuition . You were right . - I was lucky . - No . You heard a voice from within . It 's a mind game , Harley . Forget the past , leaves behind anger , guilt and jealousy . You must clear your mind , just listen inside . As you did when I found Richie . It 's a dream , just a dream . - Un vis ? - Da . - Let 's get out of here . - Cade ? I betrayed . Sorry . It 's okay , Ritchie . I 'm very sorry , Cade . It 's okay . I forgive you . Let 's go . Harlie ? Harlie , Haide , trezeste-te ! - Cade . - I got it . I went . Dex ... and Ritchie ... They are dead . They believed in the dream . Farewell , Richie . I do not understand it . I never left the hideout . Aliens , and tested their new toy . - It was like you said , a kind of test ? - Yes . Test a weapon . And I won . The question is , what was it ? Where are you going ? - Back then . You can help . Can I come with you . As nice as it sounds , it 's too dangerous . I have experience with danger , Cade . If I need you , I 'll call . But now ... If you would happen something ... No , that 's my job . I 'll catch , Foster . You never give up . - And leave me . - I know me and back . I 'll think of you , Harlem . - I know . Harlem and I showed them that we can defeat GUA one of the most powerful weapons . A car that suits you in a maze of his own mind . I succeeded because I thought the senses that do not use them in everyday life . One of the more senses that can become weapons in our arsenal . Coming here I reopened old wounds from the past which I removed every day . I found the strength to forgive and use that power travels to come . Translation and adaptation Adyc ( c ) thin

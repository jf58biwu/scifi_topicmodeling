 All right , I 'll call her ! Hey , lady , watch it ! Trying to get yourself killed ? ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey , lady , look out ! Excuse me , ma 'am . Hey , you may want to take your head out of that book once in a while . What if you knew , beyond a doubt , what was going to happen tomorrow ? What would you do ? There 's no easy answer for a guy who gets tomorrow 's news today . * * Come say hello to Aunt Estelle . Seth ? Say hi ! Hurry up , Justin . You 're gonna miss it . Why do I have to do the video ? Why can 't Grandpa Jerry ? 'Cause Grandpa Jerry 's the sandek . The what ? The sandek . He gets to hold the baby while the mohel does the procedure . Lucky him . Hey , Justin , who 's your favorite uncle ? You are , Uncle Chuck . That 's right . And don 't you forget it . You need a haircut . Join the army , son . I can 't believe I 'm related to that guy . Couldn 't they have done this in the hospital ? It 's tradition . Besides , they say it 's totally painless . The baby doesn 't feel a thing . Mom , go over there . Will somebody please get the door ? ! Gary ... Whoa , Chuck , what are you doing here ? What am I doing here ? These are my people . That 's my third cousin about to get it ... What are you doing here ? Th-th-that 's why I 'm here . The whole thing will be over in a matter of seconds . Oh , my God . The poor kid . Hey , you gotta help me , huh ? Oh , my God . I can 't even pronounce that word . Stop the mohel ! Stop ! Hey , watch the camera ! How dare you interrupt this ceremony ? ! Look , this man 's sick . He needs medical attention . Are you a doctor ? I 'm not sick ; I resent that ! Look at this guy ! He 's an accident waiting to happen . I appreciate the advice , Chuck , but you know what ? I am a doctor . I 'm board certified in cardiology - Here we go . Every function I gotta hear about Arnie the doctor . " Chuck , why can 't you be a doctor , like Arnie ? " Oh ! I 'm sorry ! I 'm sick of it , Arnie ! You know , I - you know , actually I don 't ... Sit down . I don 't feel so good . No , I 'll be all right . Somebody call a paramedic . Look , there 's one outside . So soon ? How can that be ? He was in the neighborhood . I 'm gonna be all right , doctor . Oh , my God . If that had happened during the bris ... Fishman , you know what you did ? You saved my son 's , uh ... Future . Exactly . Thank you . Yeah , don 't mention it . Is , uh , is he gonna be okay ? You were terrific . Oh , it was nothing . Do I know you ? Uh , my name is , uh , Chuck , Chuck Fishman . I 'm Arnie 's cousin . Ellen Goodman . Ellen . Ellen , and how do you know , uh , Arnie and Ilene ? I 'm their rabbi . I should be going to temple more often . Music 's a little loud , don 't you think ? What ? The music , it 's a little loud , don 't you think ? It 's not my music . Tony ! Ah , Mr. Hobson . Just the man I wanted to see . The music ? It 's good , yes ? It 's loud . Love song . You have to play it loud . Yeah , well , Tony , the neighbors are complaining . Oh , yes . The walls , they are thin . Everything you hear . Yeah , but , Tony , they 're calling in from Skokie . Skokie ? Now you make a tease . But for you , Mr. Hobson , I turn the music down . And , uh , maybe you do me a favor . What is that ? Hamburger patties . I call it heart-burger . Why ? It is obvious , no ? It is shaped like a heart . That 's not what I mean , Tony . What I 'm asking you is , why are you making hamburger hearts ? Because my own heart is bursting with happiness . Which brings me to the favor . Today is the day , Mr. Hobson . After today , nothing will be the same . Why is that ? Because , today , I am a man . I 'm going to ask Miss Abby , the woman of my dreams , if she will go out with me . Oh , that 's very nice . That 's wonderful . Yes . What 's the favor ? Ah , I need the afternoon off . You need the whole afternoon off to ask a girl out ? Well , I need time to prepare . Mario - Hey , Mario ? Hey , where 's Mario ? Where 'd he go ? Now , look ... I beg you . I never ask you for another favor in my entire life . Look , get up off your feet . Would you just be back by dinner , huh ? Molto grazie . You are a God among men . Hey , Tony , how you doing ? How else could I be ? I am in love . I drip with happiness . Dripped all over me . Me , too . Listen , I got to talk to you . I got trouble . What kind of trouble ? Big trouble . It 's the rabbi . What rabbi ? From yesterday . Oh , the nice rabbi from yesterday ? Nice ? Gare , she 's more than nice . That is one hot rabbi . I mean , you expect that kind of look from a nun . You know , like Julie Andrews or Sally Field , but a rabbi ? I can 't get her out of my head . So what 's your problem ? " Problem " ? She 's a rabbi . Oh . Well , rabbis can date . Can 't they ? She talks to God . Chuck , phone call . Who is it ? Rabbi Ellen . * * There you go . Tony ! Hello , Miss Abby . I 'm glad to see you . You are ? I 'm always glad to see you . You 're my big success story . I am ? I 've turned you into a lover . Yes . Yes ! A book lover . Yes ... books . And I love to see that . Someone who loves books as much as I do . Yes . Well , um , I ... I wanted to , uh , ask you ... You have Great Expectations . Yes ! How , how , how do you know ? You checked it out last week . Ah , Dickens . Yes . That little Pip , he has such spunk . Is there anything I can help you with ? Yes . I - I wanted to ask you , uh ... I - I wanted to ask you ... Yes ? What I mean to say is ... Do you have any more recommendations ? Don 't make a mess of it , huh ? Buddy , I am floating . Got a date with the rabbi , huh ? She could be the one . A chance encounter of biblical proportions . Two lonely people meet at a bris , and it 's all because of you . Me ? Yeah . If you hadn 't crashed that party , none of this would 've happened . I could kiss you . No , you don 't have to do that . Come here , you little cutie . Stop that . What 's wrong with you ? I got things to do , I tell you . " Woman impaled by sword . Juggler 's act proves deadly . " Hey , you ! Park 's closed . Shooting a commercial . Hold it right there . Where are my extras ? Where are my extras ? Where are they ? Camera 's ready ! Makeup ! Look at that man over there . Hey ! Hey ! Come back here ! Hey , you ! Stop ! Stop right there ! * * Abby ... Abby ! You all right ? Oh , my God , I almost ... You ... Abby ! Abby , are you all right ? Uh-huh . You 're Abby ? Uh-huh . Your Abby ? You ... saved my life . I just want you to know , Mr. Hobson , I had everything under control . You know , I-I could have saved her . Well , I know you could have , Tony . Abby was never in any danger . I - I-I was ready . And I realize that now . I just happened to be there , and I just ... I could have run like that . I am very fast . Tony , uh , just to make one thing clear , though , you know , I 'm not trying to move in on your ... territory . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Well , I 'm talking about Abby . You know , it was , it was the right place , right time kind of thing . But of course . Abby is , she is not my property . I mean , if you were to try and uh , woo her , impress her with your horseback riding bravado , I couldn 't . No , no , wait . No , but I 'm not trying to do that , okay ? Sure , sure , sure . Okay . Oh , yeah . Hey , how you doin ' ? Hey , whoa , whoa , whoa . What , what 's with all that ? You ever read the Talmud ? No , I can 't say I have . Oh , there 's no way I 'm gonna get through this thing before tonight . Oh , I was hoping to find out how it ended . I can 't even read Hebrew . Well , why this ? Gotta cram . I gotta figure out how I 'm gonna fill two hours of conversation with a rabbi . Why don 't you try talking to her ? I 'm making a horrible mistake , aren 't I ? I mean , who are we kidding here ? Me and a rabbi ? I skipped out on my own bar mitzvah . I ended up going to a movie - Any Which Way But Loose . I loved that monkey . Hey , Chuck , can I ask you something ? Two hours ago , you were floating . Now all of a sudden ... It 's a disaster . It 's Chernobyl . I 'm doomed . It 's all your fault . My fault ? If it weren 't for you , I would have never met that rabbi . Now , wait a second . You 're not shoving this responsibility off on me , pal . Yeah , you . You and that stupid paper of yours . I gotta go . Sure , leave me now - now that I 'm pouring my guts out to you . What do you want me to do for you ? I want your advice . Now tell me , what would you do if you were in my situation ? Well , I wouldn 't tell her about the bar mitzvah . Gary ? Abby ? Hi . Oh , you , you , you must be looking for Tony . I came here to see you . To thank you . Well , you already did . Not for this morning , I didn 't . Excuse me ? You saw me on the street . You told me to take my head out of my book . I knew I had seen you before . You may not believe me , but I 've seen you many times before . Oh , well , that , that 's because I get around town , Abby . Look , I 'm kind of busy right now . Not in the flesh . Hmm ? In my dreams , Gary . That 's where I 've seen you . I read a lot . I 'm , I 'm a librarian . Oh , of course , you know that already , don 't you ? Could I have a drink ? Uh , maybe some coffee , or water ? We 're out . But of course , there 's a ... there 's a coffee shop on the way to the library , and they have fantastic espresso . Bastardo . Tony . No speak . It is not important what you say . You are a snake in the grass . Miss Abby , I ... I ... Tony , this isn 't what it looks like . Tony , Tony . Oh . Poor Tony . He 's such a sweet man . I could hardly believe he 'd get so angry about anything . You know , Abby , you shouldn 't underestimate Tony , 'cause Tony , he 's very passionate . He 's ... So am I , Gary . Can , can I admit something ? Huh ? I read ... romance novels . Does that shock you ? Does that shock me ? Well , no , it doesn 't , but ... Pretty silly , huh ? I mean , I did my doctoral thesis on Russian poets . Yeah , well , right now , I 've got a crisis in the kitchen . I - I speak four languages . I spend my days surrounded by the classics : Dante , Dostoyevsky , Dickens . Great , great books , every one of them . But not the kind of books you 'd want to take to bed . It is hot in here . You don 't want to take your coat off , because it 's cold outside . Did I tell you we 're closing early today ? Do you believe in fate , Gary ? Fate ? Que sera sera . What will be will be . That nothing can change it ? No . But Tony does . And Tony 's right ... Do you believe that if two people were meant to find each other , they will . Yes , I believe in that . Oh ! Shh , say no more . Abby , listen to me . Je dois retourner à la bibliothèque . Oh , my God , I 'm speaking French . I - I do that when I get excited . Yeah , Abby , you , you ... Au revoir , mon ami . I did it again . I did it . I ... Good-bye , Gary . Bye . Who was that ? Th-That was a woman that I helped today . Twice . She thinks it 's fate . She thinks we 're supposed to be together . Maybe she 's right . Maybe it is fate . No , it 's not fate . She 's accident-prone . Oh . Sorry . She 's in love . She 's in love with the wrong guy . She 's supposed to be in love with Tony . So what are you gonna do ? I 'm gonna fix it . * I wanna be around * * To pick up the pieces ... * Hey , can you turn it down a little bit ? * When somebody breaks your heart ... * No . Please , what are you doing ? Look , Tony , I didn 't know she was gonna come by the bar . This morning , I didn 't even know that was the woman you were talking about . Well , how could I ? Do you see the way she looks at you ? No , I hadn 't noticed . It is like once upon a time , someone asked her the most important question in the world and when she looks at you , she sees the answer . Well , no , I bet you 're wrong there . Not about this . I go to the library . Twice a week , I see her . She recommends books . Some are good , and some I do not understand . But I read them all . Not for the stories , but , uh ... to see what she sees when she reads them . So when I read the books , it 's like she 's in the room with me . Tony , have you told Abby this ? I try . But the words , they ... they get stuck , right here , I know . I - I 'm not like you , Mr. Hobson . I don 't ride stallions , and I don 't rescue women from falling swords . How do you do that ? Look , Tony , uh , words - everyone , their words , they get stuck . Well , if you don 't tell Abby , you 're , you 're never gonna know how Abby really feels . You are right . I will try . Well , no , Tony , don 't try - do it . I will do it . Good . I will tell her how I feel . Good . Salud . WOMAN Attention , library patrons . The library is now closed . Tony , we 're closing . Miss Abby , I need to ask you something . Oh , sure . More recommendations ? You have changed my life , Abby . Tony ... No , no , no , no , no , wait . It 's hard for me to get these words out . And if I don 't do it now , I may never do it , and then I will be lost . So , please , let me finish . Abby , ever since the time I first saw you , I have been living a lie . I tell myself it is just an infatuation , Tony . It , it will pass . But I know it is not true . I tell myself it is okay not to know if she shares my feelings . That it is better not to know . To hope that she does is enough . More lies . It is not enough , Abby . And I have to know . Probably you feel you do not know me very well , but I love you , Abby , and I have to know . How do you feel ? * * So you want to tell me what happened ? " Feelings are not negotiable . " What 's that ? It is what Abby said when I told her how I felt . She said that she was sorry . She wished she could return my feelings , but she could not . " Are you sure , " I asked her . " Have you looked inside your heart ? " She shook her head . " Feelings are not negotiable . " Tony , maybe you should give her some more time . You are not listening , Mr. Hobson . She told me she is not in love with me . She 's in love with you . I was better off before when at least I still had hope . Well , now wait a second , Tony . Now , listen ... If it 's all right with you , Mr. Hobson , I wish to be alone with my misery . Please . All right . Stupid , stupid , stupid . Biggest idiot in the world ? Fishman . Runner-up ? That 'd be Fishman , too . What 's wrong with him ? Bad date . Spill it . I blew it . I completely blew it . It was like I left part of my brain at home . Oh , come on , it couldn 't have been that bad . Gary , I told the truth . You told the , the ... the truth about what ? About everything . So uh , did you have a good day ? Oh , yeah . It was busy . Uh , I had a funeral this morning . And then a board meeting . And then I helped three students back-to-back on their bar mitzvah speeches . I skipped mine . What ? My bar mitzvah . I skipped it . I thought you should know . That , that 's okay , Chuck . I 'm not a religious cop . I 'm just a rabbi . I don 't speak Greek either . Greek ? I didn 't assume that you did . I 'm just telling you that because the last time I was here in this restaurant , I was on a date with this gorgeous model . Anyway , I tried to impress her by ordering in Greek . Before she arrived , I had a little chat with the waiter . He told me what to say . You , you didn 't tell her about your brother and the candy at Halloween ? Oh , yeah . That came out before the appetizers . When I was a kid , I stole my little brother 's Halloween candy . He was on crutches ; broken leg . You know how hard that little guy had to work to get that candy ? Why ? I don 't know . There I was , sitting across from a rabbi , and it was like God himself was listening in . I - I-I ... that was it . I was just compelled to tell the truth . She 's never gonna want to see me again . It was like fate brought us together , and the truth tore us apart . Hey , Chuck ? Phone . I 'm so ashamed . Gary Hobson . Huh ? Yeah . Oh , that 's ... What 's that ? A rump roast . What 's it look like ? It 's your lucky night , lover boy . Hey , sign here . Who from ? Guess . Thanks . Excusa . I go home now . Oh , are you feeling better , Tony ? My heart is like a tenderloin on a spit . Well , I-I 'm I 'm sure you 'll feel better in the morning . I do not think so . But thank you for saying that . Gare , you 're not gonna believe this . She wants to see me again . The rabbi . Ooh , those are beautiful . No . Who are they from , Abby ? Tony ... Now look , Tony , I ... Hey , don 't worry about him . Listen , back to me . The rabbi called . She told me that I was one of the most interesting guys she 's ever met . We got another date . Great . You know what ? This truth thing , I , I think there might be something to it . Now what am I gonna do about Abby ? My advice ? Try the truth . Now look , Abby , I don 't want to hurt you , but here it is ... I don 't share your feelings . You 're trying to protect me . No , I 'm not trying to protect you . What I 'm saying is ... You 're married , aren 't you ? Huh ? You 've got a wife , and you don 't love her anymore . Maybe you never did , but she 's sick . That 's it ! She 's-she 's dying ! And even , even if she wasn 't , you would never leave her because you made a commitment to her . And in a world of broken promises and shattered dreams , you are the kind of man that stands by his commitment ! Yeah , but , Abby , listen . No , I 'm not married . I , I was married . Oh ! What ? She died ! She left you alone with a lifetime of memories . No ! I know . You have suffered . But life has given you a second chance , and you must grab it , Gary ! Grab it with both hands ! Chuck . Ellen , hi . I 'm sorry I 'm early , but I was in the neighborhood and I ... No , that 's not true . Uh , actually , I , I just couldn 't wait to see you . I 'm glad . Well , come in . Okay . Uh , these are for you . Oh , Chuck , they 're beautiful . Well , let me go put them in some water . Okay . Do you want something to drink ? No , I 'll wait until we , uh , we have dinner . Okay . Well , why don 't you take off your jacket and make yourself comfortable ? Oh , they 're really beautiful . I 've always loved roses . Chuck ... who 's Abby ? What ? This card , it says , " To Gary , From Abby " . Let me see that . Oh , the stupid florist . They must have changed the orders ... And I had roses , too . Huh . No , that 's not true . Actually , uh , these were sent to my partner , and it didn 't seem like he wanted ' em , so I took ' em . Oh . I mean , I figured why waste the 50 bucks ? Not that you 're not worth 50 bucks . Gosh , you 're worth much more than 50 bucks . You 're worth a million billion zillion dollars . Chuck , it 's okay . I like a man who 's practical ... who 's honest . I like you . You do ? Just , um , get rid of the card next time . Right . Mr. Hines , my name is Chuck Fishman , and , uh , I 'm the guy that dinged your blue Mercedes last weekend . Well , uh , actually , it was more than dinged . I , I imagine you need a whole new door . Anyway , I can be reached at McGinty 's Bar . And , uh , we 're listed in the phone book . Thank you . What was that all about ? The truth , Gare . The whole truth , and nothing but . I 'm telling you , it 's ... it 's gonna be my new motto . So , you 're clicking with the rabbi , huh ? Oh , yeah . The truth - what a concept . How 's it going with Abby ? Oh , I told her the , the truth . It didn 't work . Yeah , well , the truth 's not for everyone . Oh , I 'm in a real mess . Abby thinks you 're a hero , right ? Yeah . It 's not me , it 's the paper . What if the paper made someone else a hero for a change ? If the paper thought someone else was a hero ... You mean Tony ? And down comes the duck . Wait a second . Now , the paper comes to me . I 'm not supposed to loan out the paper . What ? It comes with instructions ? I don 't think so . Well , no , it doesn 't , but ... Look , the paper got you into this mess , let it help you get out of it . Well , how do you suppose it 's gonna do that ? Boy meets girl . Boy loses girl . Boy gets paper . Paper helps boy get girl back . Gary loses girl . End credit . Well , I-I suppose , yeah , I - if it was a small story . Something , uh , something minor . Something harmless . Something , uh , like this . I don 't understand . Wh-What do you want me to do ? I just want you to watch after her . It 's a dangerous park , and I don 't want anything to happen to her . What is going to happen ? Well , nothing 's gonna happen to her , Tony , because you 're gonna be watching her . I 'll be right back . Oh , eshpet ! Una momente . Thanks , Tony . What ? What , Mister ? I don 't understand . Abby ? Oh , Gary . I am sorry I 'm late . Would you like to take a stroll ? Lead on , MacDuff . Come on , baby . Come on , baby . Here , pretty baby . Come on , pretty baby . Come on . Here 's the corn . Come on . Come on . There 's 500 benches in this park , and you 've got to pick mine . I told you , all the pigeons are here . What are you doing , Gloria ? I told you , don 't feed the pigeons at my bench . Oh , leave me alone , Herb . You don 't own the bench . Give me the pigeon food . Hey ! Hey , what are you doing ? ! That 's my purse ! Yeah , I knew you 'd call . Call it fate , call it intuition . I was looking at the phone , and I got one of those tingly feelings . You ever get one of those ? Look , Abby , I-I don 't think you heard what I was trying to say in the library . Oh , my God , look ! That man 's trying to steal that woman 's purse , Abby . Aren 't you gonna stop him ? Me ? No , I 'm not gonna get involved . I 'm not the hero type . Why , look , look , that , that looks like Tony . That is Tony . Now that 's a brave man . Unhand that purse , you scoundrel ! What are you ... Uh-oh . That 's the wrong purse snatcher . I 'm trying to help you ! Oh ! What are you doing ? ! Oh , girls , take a look at a real hero . So I , uh , take it your experiment of turning Tony into a hero didn 't go too well , huh ? Train wreck . Yeah , that 's what I figured . Thought you had a date with a rabbi . Oh , yeah . She invited me to her service ; her gig . I left early . Isn 't that kind of , uh , frowned upon ? I couldn 't take it anymore . You should have heard her sermon . We all know the story of Daniel ; thrown into the lion pit , kept alive by the virtue of his honesty . Tonight I want to talk about the Daniels among us ; people who can teach us something about the truth . And I want to talk about one man in particular . This is a man who is not afraid to admit that he cries regularly . And this is a man who has no need to create a fake persona , a shield . This is a man who , who 's proud to show the world his flaws . Yes , um , he can be shallow , but honestly shallow . And yes , like the rest of us , he can be superficial , vain , but honest about it . Always honest . Like this time he took his date to a Greek restaurant ... Obviously , she likes you . I mean , the guy she 's describing , it 's you . That 's just it . I couldn 't stand the guy she was describing . Who could ? I 'd like to track that guy down and beat the living snot out of him . That guy is ruining it for everyone else . He 's raising the bar to a level of impossible heights . He 's a wimp , a loser and a jerk . And worst of all , Gare , the guy she was talking about was me . Fishman . I 'm looking for Chuck Fishman . What do you need ? I 'm looking for Chuck Fishman . Who are you ? Hines . Chester Hines . Fishman trashed my Mercedes . Which one is he ? Him . Hey . Here . Put this on . What 's that ? It 's my heart . Ah . Believe me , couple of weeks , no one will notice . That guy was pretty fast for his size , huh ? What happened to the new Chuck ? You know , the truth , the whole truth , nothing but the truth Chuck . It got old . Tony . No ! You do not say a word to me ! Chuck , someone 's looking for you up front . Tell you what , I 'm gonna let you two have your privacy . Tony ... Look , Tony , what-what happened today at the park , it was all a mistake . It was my mistake . No . The only mistake was me thinking that a woman like Abby would ever be interested in a man like me . Congratulations , Mr. Hobson . You 've won . But I beg you , take good care of Abby . Wait . Where you going ? To Palermo , where I will sit and wait for word that you have died . Because until you do , no man stands a chance with Abby ! I 'll finish packing in the morning . " Fatal accident at library , woman crushed . " A woman was crushed to death yesterday morning " at the Chicago Public Library , when a hanging mobile " fell from the ceiling . " The victim was attending a weekly meeting of the Bronte reading society . " Abby ... Gary ! Hi . The-the Nelson Reading Room , the-the Bronte reading society , they 're meeting today ? Yeah . Where are they doing that ? At the end of that hall . " ... were so angry , they flung me out onto the heath on top of Wuthering Heights . " Whoa ! Gary ... Not now , Abby . Ladies ! Get out of the way ! Hey ! " I am ... " Hey , lady , get out of the way , would you ? No ! Uh ... You , you 'll just save anyone , won 't you ? Abby ... You 're just an indiscriminate saver . Excuse me ? No , no , don 't try that puppy dog look on me . Save it for the Bronte society women or the , or the Jane Austin group ; they 'll be here at 3 : 00 . Maybe you 'll get lucky , one of them will have a coronary . Abby ... Look , Abby ... I thought what we had was special . We don 't have anything . That 's what I 've been trying to tell you , but you don 't listen ! Well , I 'm listening now . Oh , no ... Look , Abby , you 're a very smart woman . I - you 've memorized more books than-than I 'll ever read , but-but for such a smart woman , sometimes you can be very dense . What is that supposed to mean ? Well , it means , open up your eyes . You blew it . Look , there 's a guy out there who-who 's in love with you . A real guy , not-not a romance novel guy , but-but a guy who , a guy who would give up his life for you . And-and I think , if you just lift your eyes up out of your book and-and look around , I think you might feel the same way for him . I got to go . I like you , Ellen . I really do . It 's just ... I 'm gonna get right to the point here . You and me , it 's not gonna work out . What ? I can 't do it anymore . The problem - the problem is that the truth - and I mean this literally - the truth hurts . Oh , God , how did that happen ? ! Ever since I met you , my life has taken a turn for the weird . The weird ? You 've had a tremendous impact on me , Ellen . You 've changed my life . And I don 't like it . Oh . Last week , I dented a guy 's blue Mercedes . And , uh , like an idiot , I gave him my name . He came to see me yesterday . And he hit you in the face ? No , not me . He popped my best friend Gary . It was the guy who came in after him . The cable guy , the former cable guy . I gave him 50 bucks to get free HBO two years ago . So I called the cable company because , you know , total honesty , and I told them exactly what happened . He lost his job , and , uh , he wanted to talk things over . So , you 're-you 're breaking up with me because when you 're with me , you 're ... Honest . Compulsively honest . Truthful . Nice . I see . That-that 's certainly a new one . Well ... I 'm sorry , Chuck . Well , I 'll be seeing you around . You mean that ? No . Maybe on the high holidays . Buy a ticket . Right . " Dear Miss Abby , " I am finally through with Great Expectations . " I apologize for its lateness . " Attached , please find my overdue fine of $ 1.24 . " Thank you for all your book recommendations . " You 're a kind and patient woman . " I am returning to Sicily , " but I will think of you fondly . " My feelings remain unnegotiated . Antonio . " Thank you . Ah , that 's cold . So it 's all over for Tony , huh ? That 's too bad . Love is tough . Oh , you got that right , Robin . You know , there are some mysteries that-that will never be solved . Here comes one of them right now . Excuse me . Gary . Abby . Uh , we 're kind of busy right now , so ... Actually , I was here to see Tony . Tony ? Uh , Tony 's back in the kitchen . But ... he 's cleaning out his stuff . Tony . Abby . What are you ... ? I made a mistake . I thought I had fallen in love with a hero . But I had no idea what a hero really was . Anyone can run around and save princesses from burning castles . That doesn 't take a hero , it just takes good timing . But two days ago , I met a real hero , a man who had the courage to stand in front of the woman he loved and show her his heart . Can you forgive me ? Well , somebody pack my bags . I 'm going straight to hell . I did it , I dumped the rabbi . You got socked in the eye by a rabbi ? Well , not quite . It 's a , it 's a long , complicated story , Gary . Ice ? Thanks . Mm . I 'll get you another one . You know , Gare , this love stuff - it 's-it 's not all it 's cracked up to be . Right now , I am inclined to agree with you . Gary . You do nice work . Yeah . Hey , Gare , you have a visitor . Gary Hobson ? Can I help you ? I just wanted to thank you for saving my life . Cheers . Uh , I , uh ...

 Roger . 0-2-1 , 0-2-2 , 0-2-9 . White three , White four . Red one , Red two , all clear . Roger . Drop a sonar buoy at 3-3-0 ! They 're really giving this their best . We just got a personal dispatch from the captain of Blue 6 . Read it . " If we get lucky on our end , feel free to help us out . " " I 'll buy drinks for you at next month 's party . " On his little salary ? Okay , let 's take her down . Time to drive Zorndyke out into the open . Yes , sir ! What a mess ... This is no place for anyone to be living in . A real hotshot , huh ? Better than me ? Seems he 's in the salvage business now . A freelance submariner . Why do we have to call in an outsider ? ! Please don 't ask me . We were ordered to , right ? Mr. Hayami ? Mr. Hayami ! I know you 're in here ! My name 's Mayumi Kino . I 've come from Blue 6 . Please ... Please , come back to Blue 6 ! We need your skills as a submariner ! We can 't take on Zorndyke the way we are now ! We ... ! We 're mankind 's last ... How old are you ? Eighteen . Blue 6 is going to counterattack Zorndyke 's forces ! Enemies killing other enemies . He 's the destroyer of the world ! The worst criminal in history ! I don 't believe you ! I 'll never forgive what he did ! I ... ! You don 't agree with me ? ! How much ? My guarantee . Well ... Maybe if you came back to Blue 6 ... ? I 'm headed to Brunei tomorrow . I landed a new job . Now leave . Please , think this over ! This operation is vital ! Even the captain ... You 're a friend of the captain 's , right ? This is a personal order from him . Your old partner from your Grampus team is asking you to- - Get out ! I 'm not leaving ! I ... I have a lot riding on this mission , too ! If we don 't do something now , it really will be too late for our world ! It already IS too late . No matter what we try now , it won 't work . What can we do ? Can we change anything ? This ruined world of ours ? ! It doesn 't matter any more . Nothing does . Hey , why don 't you come with me tomorrow ? Just screw the career thing and join me . There 's still stuff in this world worth saving , right ? Didn 't you know what I do ? Precious metals , jewels valuable securities , weapons , even nuclear materials . I 'm a freelance salvager who 'll go after anything . You don 't need to say it . I 'm a hyena of the sea . Pretty much everything is sunk under the sea . Everything became garbage . And they wanted me to keep diving into it ! Silly , huh ? But I changed . Maybe I couldn 't change the world but I could change myself and find a life to live . No good , huh ? What 's WITH that guy ? ! He makes me sick ! Wanted some conditions , huh ? Contact the boat . We 're going back . Aye , sir ! We 're now returning to the boat . Estimate we 'll be there by 14 : 00 hours , over . CZ-9i , CZ-9i , this is Mega Mouse . Please respond , over . Aye , sir . We contacted the target as planned , but without success . We 're now returning to the boat . Estimate we 'll be there by 14 : 00 hours , over . Damn it ! Lost it ? Yes , sir . Don 't panic . Let 's try to reacquire it . Turning to 3-0-5 ! We can 't keep up with it , can we ? Can 't hear it . No reaction on the magnetometer . It 's going after Blue 6 , isn 't it ? This is OUR backyard . I won 't let that thing lay a finger on them ! Damn that Verg . He 's even more persistent than I thought . Their firepower isn 't as strong as it was last time . We 'll smash ' em with no problem . If Hayami comes back to us . We don 't need a man who won 't come . We can handle them fine on our own ! Go to it . Mankind stands between the heavens and the earth and there are those who strain to hear the voice of heaven . In my case , though , I listen for the voices of the sea and the land . You 're from Blue 6 , right ? ! Do something ! Blast those things ! Can 't you drive them out to sea ? Good luck ! We 're counting on you ! Somebody ! Somebody , let us on , please ! Take us to Blue 6 's dock ! Please ! Hey ! There are those who call me to task for hurting people . But if they suppose that I hurt people they must see that I , too , have been hurt . God dammit ! God dammit ! That is natural . It is the nature of the power granted to men . It is the essence of the beast . It is intellect which cloaks it . Jump ! That was dangerous ! The China Sea is always dangerous ! Departure route B-3 ! Engines , one-third ! Course ahead reads clear . Message from our scout plane . They 've lost sight of the enemy ! Activate Lorenzinni System ! ASW ! ASW , standing by ! Message from Mega Mouse . They 'll rendezvous with us in five minutes . And it looks like they have a guest . We 've heard from Musuca ! Blue 6 has left port ! So , they 've made their move , eh ? Let 's hit them now , Verg ! No , wait . We 'll let Musuca handle this for now . You won 't escape this time , Blue 6 ! Status board check on our watertight and drainage systems . Check , okay . Welcome back . Well , so you didn 't get the visitor we had planned on , did you ? No , sir . It all went to plan . It 's been a long time , Hayami . It seems you 've saved some of my precious crewmembers . I have to thank you for that . I was just passing by , so ... I see . Captain , we 're ready to dive . All right , let 's go ! Maintain course on B-3 , mode : quick ! Take us down to 40 and hold there . Maintain main engine output at one-third ! Flood forward ballast tanks ! Dive ! Dive ! Kino ! Send out the Turtle ! Aye , sir ! Musuca One . We estimate it carries 12 Kumos . We think Verg 's command ship is somewhere outside of the bay , but we haven 't found it yet . We 'll handle Musuca . You take care of any small fries . You think it 's coming ? That thing ? The Ghost Ship . Does it take you back ? We 'll be launching soon . Get in back . I 'm staying here . What are you talking about ? ! This is a high-performance machine ! You can 't handle the front after all this time ! Are you even listening to me ? ! Chamber flood in one minute . Get that thing buttoned up . Standing by . Okay . Tell me why . Why did you come to save us ? Tell me why . Why do you try so hard ? Because it 's my city . My home is on the bottom of the sea now . - Three Kumos , dead ahead ! - Let ' em have it ! Grampus , moving out ! Good luck , Kino ! Whoa ! Are you sure you can handle this ? ! Two Kumos , right below us ! - Let 's take her down ! - Behind us ! Behind us ! Only one round left ! You have to be more careful- - Shut up ! Should we switch to active , sir ? No , not yet . Not yet ... Head for the shallows ! With all the terrain clutter , there 're too many noise and heat sources . - Anything on the Lorenzinni ? - Nothing . Set enzyme warheads to homing and deploy launchers . I don 't like this . I 've got a bad feeling . It 's close ... Don 't ! Look out ! Get away from it now ! It 's the enemy ! Stand aside ! Don 't kill her ! It 's begun ... Microphone 7 . Are those sharks ? No ! Torpedoes ! Return fire , dead ahead ! Tubes 5 and 6 , A.T.C.B. Fire ! Tubes 0 and 1 , C-AD-CAP ! Fire ! It 's coming right for us ! It 's so fast ! 40 degrees up trim ! Ahead full speed ! Open rear launchers ! All hands , grab onto whatever you can ! Depth now 35 ... 30 ... 25 ... 20 ... 15 ... 10 ... We 're going through the roof ! Rear tubes 3 and 4 , FIRE ! Another shot . Incoming ! What ? ! It 's the Narushio ! Rear tubes 0 , 1 , 5 , and 6 ! Snap shot ! FIRE ! Why ? Why did you let it go ? It was the enemy ! What was that thing ... ? A monster . One that Zorndyke created . One of Zorndyke 's ... What ... What exactly has begun ? What they want ... is to kill every last one of us . Dead ! Musuca is dead ! Musuca ? ! Musuca ? ! Revenge ! Revenge ! Revenge ! Revenge ! Not bad , Blue 6 . However ... Blue 6 ! Blue 6 ! Blue 6 ! Now they 'll be at their most careless , won 't they ?

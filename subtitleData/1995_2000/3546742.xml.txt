 ( Crossing bell rings ) - Come on , come on , come on ! No ! Paramedics pronounced 20 minutes ago . Megan Treadwell . I ran her plates 33 tomorrow . One-on-one with a train . What did she think that she could beat it ? Hey . Door handle Point of impact : Passenger side door . Dead centre Question is ... why did the SUV cross the track s ? To get to the other side . Sheriff says we 're holding up trains all over the country . The railroad depends on keeping the main line open . We can 't take this back to the garage . Yeah , well , unfortunately , his priority is clearing this train from these track s . You have two hours . Well , where are you going ? Suspicious circs in town . This one 's all yours . Thanks , but you gotta give me some guys . Sara 's all you get . All I need . ( Bell rings continuously ) Burglary-in-progress call . Once we made entry , we found the victim downstairs . Never knew this place existed . The Western States Historical Society . It 's not on a lot of tourist maps . ( Bell stops ) - I had them cut the wires . We need to identify the source of the alarm , Ray . Security company said it was downstairs . The body 's there too . Trying to get them to turn some more lights on in here . There are no more lights , O 'Riley . It 's a controlled environment . Notice how you 're not sweating ? It 's probably 66 degrees in here . 35 % relative humidity Too much light too much heat degrades the book s . What ? Nobody 's got a key ? The curator 's across town . He 's on his way . She looks dead to me . You got first touch . 10 : 48 . Red foam . Blue tint . The foam could be from blood in her lungs . Oedema The skin is cyanotic Maybe a blood disease . Leukaemia , meningitis . We 'll know more after the post Hey , don 't do that . Excuse me ? These are very rare book s . Aaron Pratt Librarian . Only other person here when the alarm sounded . Did he tell you what he was doing here ? Oh , yeah . Watching her . Set off the alarm trying to get in the cage . ( Faltering ) I wasn 't watching her . I always say good night to Veronica because I have to leave at 8 : 03 to catch the 8 : 10 bus . It 's three blocks away . And sometimes the bus comes at 8 : 08 , so I have to rush to catch it . So you went down to the basement to say good night ? " Good night , Veronica . " " Good night , Aaron . " Sometimes she walks me to the bus . Did she walk you to the bus tonight ? " Are you coming ? " " No , you go ahead without me . I nave more work to do " Then a Uniball pen rolled across the desk fell onto the chair nit the floor and stopped rolling at the wastebasket Then water water falls into her eyes . You mean she was sweating ? From her forehead . Lots And then she grabs her stomach with both hands . " Aaron . " Then she put on her ... new face . Shelley 's Frankenstein . Up and down , flopping around like a salmon on my uncle 's fishing boat She was convulsing ? I ... couldn 't help her because the cage is locked and I don 't have a key . Hey there . Warrick 's got three residential burglaries , so ... Mr Pratt , will you excuse me for a moment ? According to O 'Riley , this guy 's body language says he 's guilty . I think he 's autistic . Autistic ? What , you mean like Rain Man ? Rain Man was a savant , extremely rare . Aaron Pratt is a high-functioning autistic man with superior right-brain abilities . Kinda sounds like you . The crime scene 's in the basement . Man , I hate rushing through a crime scene . Two years from now , no-one is gonna care the Sheriff turned this into a scoop-and-run . The call was made above our heads . Just document the time in your notes . - I 'll let you testify on this one . - Thanks . ( Dog bark s ) Hey , little guy . Let 's see . His name is Maverick . Lives on Martingale Street in Henderson . That 's not that far from here . - Guess I 'll go call Animal Control . - OK I 'll be right back . Come on , boy . Let 's get you home . So all you saw was a car trying to beat the signal ? I 'm puttin ' 55 miles an hour . It 's dark . I got an oil leak . Can 't figure out where . I looked up and I saw something . The SUV . Like I said , it was dark . I thought it was stopping . I turn my head for one second , next thing I know it 's on the track s . With all due respect , we 've got the right of way out here . Thanks for your time . That 's not yours , is it ? I am collecting evidence . Do you have an address on the vic yet ? 855 Martingale . The vic had a passenger . Say hello to Maverick . Have you finished with our lady of the library ? As finished as I 'm going to be . You were right . Cyanosis . The blood was unable to oxygenate her tissue . Explains the blue face . Underlying cause ? With blood in her lungs , asphyxiation 's out . I found vomit in her throat bloody stool haemolysis and some irritation of the mucous membrane on her tongue . I won 't know more till I get the blood tests back . Could be blood-borne disease . I 'm thinking about homicide . Then you know more than I do . Excuse me sir - It 's fine . - Whoa , whoa . Sir , you can 't come in here . I told the officer upstairs . I 'm Stanley Hunter . The curator ? Do you have any idea of the damage you 're causing ? With your dust , flashbulbs . You see that ? Right there behind you . That is a 17th-century text by Johannes Vanden Avelen . It 's one of two volumes in the world . Now , do you go to the Louvre and put your hands all over the Raft Of The Medusa ? Officer , Mr Hunter would like to give his statement to Detective O 'Riley . Statement ? I just got here . I don 't even know what happened . But what I do know is that these are masterpieces . One of a kind . They 're evidence in an active criminal investigation . Also one of a kind . Mr Hunter why don 't we go upstairs and talk ? The good news , Nick . We had a camera in here . But there 's no surveillance system . Yeah , there is . Aaron Pratt . We just have to figure out how to get the film out of his head . Filament . Train probably busted out her headlights . First thing on our list when we get to the tow yard . Catherine ? Check this out . Two sets of skid mark s . One set going forward ... These skid marks are about seven feet shy of the gate . The second set of skid marks are darker . More rubber residue Could be an overlay . Looks like the tyres were spinning in place . In reverse Burnin ' rubber . Goin ' nowhere . So ... which set of skid marks are telling the story ? Maybe they both are . So all of your chemicals in here are alkaline ? No . We 're not dealing with the far ends of the pH range . See , old book pages are slightly acidic . The acid eats away the paper . We neutralise them by a solution - that is slightly basic . - To reach seven . Neutral pH . Exactly . Imidazole . 15 per cent ammonia . That 's the sort of thing we work with here . It 's all about preserving the book s . You know , not that you could even assign a value , but do you have any idea how much each of these books is worth ? No . The first printed book was the Gutenberg Bible . It sold at Christie 's for $ 5.3 million . Lewis and Clark 's Elkskin Journal sold for $ 500,000 . We have an illustrated Audubon , The Birds Of America , which is worth an estimated $ 300,000 . All of that and you never thought about beefing up your security ? Special collections are kept in the vault . Any rare book removed from the vault gets scanned through a coder . If the book is to be read , it 's delivered to a secure room upstairs , and if Veronica was going to work on it , it stayed down here . Was this one of the books that Veronica was restoring ? Yes . It was published in 1 T9T . The author was a British botanist . It 's worth an estimated $ 300,000 . It 's really not a dangerous profession . We got a situation . You know that weird guy ? He 's not weird , O 'Riley , he 's autistic . Whatever . First on the scene and he 's got sticky fingers . " But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve for daws to peck at : I am not what I am . " Othello , Act 1 , Scene 1 , lines 61 and 62 . Lago to Roderigo . Very good , Aaron . Now , you want to tell me how Othello ended up in your briefcase ? It 's my favourite Shakespeare tragedy . I like Hamlet myself . And I bet Mr Hunter is into King Lear . He 's very concerned with property rights . He tells me the rare books are kept in the vault and they 're not allowed off site ( Whispers ) Well , Mr Hunter doesn 't like me . I don 't think the rule was made with you in mind . He breaks the rules all the time . He takes the books home ? No , he ... eats his lunch in his office . Carrots celery tuna on wholewheat ... And Veronica . What do you mean " and Veronica " ? She 's eating , and he takes her sandwich ... and he puts his hand on her breast - And then he puts his tongue Aaron ! I get it . Did they know you were watching ? You know that filament you picked up ? Yeah ? The lamp cover 's smashed but the filament 's intact . So the filament 's from another car ? Well ... tail-lights have different filaments , so yean Paint transfer . - Recent ? - Hard to say This right rear tyre 's lost a lot of rubber . I got a cellphone . Battery 's dead . Hey , Catherine ? Her emergency brake was on . Maybe her brakes failed . She had to engage it for some reason . I 'm thinking maybe another vehicle was involved . The engineer didn 't mention a second driver . Maybe he didn 't see it . 15 minutes before my next post . Bottled chemicals from the library ? Great room . Great table . I could use this . Lay out all the body parts , get a real overview . Is that a light under there ? - Do you have something for me ? - Oh , your vic ? Poisoned . Substance as yet unidentified . There 's no smoking gun in any of these bottles . What 's on the label is what 's in the bottle . Isopropyl alcohol , 15 per cent ammonia solution , imidazole , bleach . When you isolate the toxin , you 'll have a better idea where it came from . - Nick ? - Hm ? I love this table . There 's no glass on the filament . 10 : 30 at night ? Crim 101 . If a guy 's driving along at night with his lights on , gets in a wreck glass breaks fuses to the filament Instant evidence . But there 's no glass on the filament . His headlights weren 't on . Black car , headlights off ... Easy for an engineer to miss . So he hit her SUV . Accidental or intentional ? Hard to tell . - Maybe not . ( Dials ) - These books are from the Historical Society . - That 's my mail . Aaron , what about these book s ? No , d-d-don 't mix those up . I have two bills due tomorrow , gas and electric , and I have to mail them on my way to work . Don 't . You 're messing everything up . Aaron , may I have a glass of water , please ? - Of course you may . - Thank you . Is this guy the real deal ? I think he 's incapable of deception , Nick . We were just witnessing displaced anxiety . I mean , look around . Everything 's in precise order . Organised by size . Order provides comfort . His whole life is based on routine . Without it , he can 't function . I 'll check out the bedroom . Mountain Spring Water , Calistoga , California . Bottled at the source . Thank you . You 're welcome . Now , how did these books get here ? - Veronica brought them . - She was here ? Yes , she was here . We date . What do you mean you date ? We have dinner . Roast beef , baked potato , organic broccoli Acacia Pinot Noir . Shakespeare In Love . DVD , Miramax . MCMX CVIII . You two were involved with each other ? Why , don 't you think she would date someone like me ? No . You told me Veronica was involved with Mr Hunter . I have a Masters in Library Science and an English degree from UNLV . And some people , like Mr Hunter , treat me like a freak . But Veronica didn 't . She ... loved me . Not him . Grissom ? You might want to come back here a sec . Thank you . Personal effects . Like some ... creepy little shrine . Vic 's hair . She was seeing Hunter . Aaron got jealous . Incapable of deception , huh ? How do you feel about murder ? " Yet she must die , else she 'll betray more men . Put out the light , and then put out the light . " Last call on her cellphone was to 911 . Reel to reel 's already interfaced on my computer . 911 What 's your emergency ? On my God you 've got to help me ! - Try to calm down Where are you ? - There 's this maniac he 's following me ( Train horn ) - Help me please ! - What 's your location ? ( Dog whimpers ) - Can you isolate the individual track s ? - Yes , ma 'am . - Good . Lose the dog . - Train too , please . - Ma 'am what 's your location ? - Help me please ! - On God no ! ( Small creak ) - Please stop ! Help ! ( Engine revs ) No ! She was flooring it . With the emergency brake on . It doesn 't make any sense . OK . Lose the victim 's voice and let 's just hear the car . ( Revving ) Two engines . - Separate them out . - Yeah . ( Revving ) SUV Sounds like any regular four-cylinder . ( Revving ) - Sounds like the same thing . - No , no . Hang on . ( High-pitched revving ) You hear that ? Turbo . Probably diesel . She definitely likes you . Did you ever see Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes ? Cos there 's something in your victim 's blood that looks like one of those Heirlooms . No , it 's not pulling a spectra , it 's not a chemical . No , it 's a large , ugly , globular mass . You know , it 's probably a protein . That 's the largest mass of anything in the body . Except organs , of course . But it 's foreign . How did it get in there ? Cart before the horse , Nick . First you identify it , then you figure out where it came from . - I always thought you kept your porn in there . - Uh , move it around . OK , this is a 66-kilodalton globular protein . Composed of two disulphide linked sub-units , A and B. Very impressive . I know what you all think of me . That I 'm just another pretty face that got to where I am by sleeping with Catherine . But seriously , Phi Beta Kappa , Stanford . Can I help it if I 'm hip ? Yeah , yeah . Which one of your relatives got you in ? Full ride . Hey , eyes forward . Now , A and B chains link together to form a large three-dimensional structure of these beta sheets and helices . - Translation ? - Wait . You just drew the molecular structure of a foreign protein . Plant ? Correct . But more specifically , lectin . ( Gasps ) This is nastier than I thought . It 's ricin . A biotoxin . - Biotoxin ? - Yeah . " A B chain binds to glycoside residues which trigger endocytotic uptake of the protein , which internalises the toxin and begins ... " Whoa , whoa , whoa . Stop now . Biotoxin as in ... anthrax , smallpox ? I was at that crime scene for eight hours , man . Relax , man . It takes , like , two hours for ricin symptoms to show - and , like , 48 more to kill you . - What kind of symptoms are we talking about ? Um ... Sweats ? - Cramps ? - No . - Convulsions ? - Uh-uh . Then you 're fine . Now , where did you say this woman worked ? Western States Historical Society . Hey . I just got the word on our library victim . How does ricin grab you ? Wow . Ricin . I never would have gone there . But it explains the irritation of the mucous membrane on her tongue . So you think she ate the poison ? I don 't know about ate , but the ricin made contact with her tongue , which means you 're probably looking for a powder . A day in the life . Megan Treadwell Wakes up at home on Martingale Street puts the dog in the car heads to work , at her desk by 9am . And we know this how ? Brass . Talked to her boss . - Why the dog ? - Dog went with her every day . - So she works till six ? - Eight , actually . Hard worker . She packs up and leaves the office . Except she doesn 't go home . She runs an errand . I found these in the front seat of her SUV . There 's only one store in Las Vegas that makes them . Yeah , but it happens all the time . The parking spaces are too narrow . And at a premium now that the restaurant moved in . This guy was out of line . Almost ... psycho . Because of this woman ? Yeah . Maverick 's owner . I think her name was um ... something with an M. - Megan . - Yeah . And this guy yelled so loud . I came out here just to check it out . - He said something like ... - " You could nave killed me bitch ! " I heard it too . - Did you see it ? - Kind of I mean , I didn 't hear a crash or anything , just brakes . It seemed like she backed out didn 't see him Happened right over there . Oh . Oh . Hey ! Hey ! And that set him off ? The last thing this guy needed was coffee . Hey ! Pull your head out of your ass and use your mirror ! Was he a regular ? Double latte , tall . Monday through Friday between 8 : 30 and 9 : 00 . Does Mr Double Latte have a name ? I think it 's Croft . Works right down the street CPA He 's always telling us how to streamline our business . How did Megan react to Mr Croft ? She told him to go to hell . - Go to hell ! - No you go to hell ! You 're an ass ! And then just drove off . And what about Mr Croft ? Everyone was just staring at him , and then he got in his car and peeled out . Ricinus communis . Un castor beans Like in castor oil Botanically speaking , it 's a spurge , not a bean . Ricin is made from the husk Castor oil is made from what 's inside . Hm . Which makes two people who know that . - You and the guy who wrote the book . - Three Someone knew how to turn this spurge into a poison . Hey , guys . That 's Aaron 's book , right ? Mm-hm . Shouldn 't you be looking at that under a fume hood ? We brought this from his apartment , not his office . What makes you think there 's a difference ? He probably cooked up that ricin in his kitchen . Our guys didn 't find anything there . So he cleans up well . What , you 're not feeling sorry for this guy now , are you ? - Hey , man , he is autistic . - Anybody else would be in a cell . Yes , I 've heard of ricin . Georgi Markov , 19T8 . Bulgarian political refugee in London Assassinated by injection with a ricin pellet shot out of a black umbrella . Died two days later . Not that different from the way Veronica died , is it ? I found this book in your apartment . What if I also told you that I found your fingerprint on this page ? Page 153 . I ... don 't touch that book any more . But you did touch it . Why are you mad at me ? Answer the question . I don 't touch this book any more ! It ... doesn 't feel right . Ever since you killed Veronica ? I loved Veronica . What do you mean it doesn 't feel right ? Like a new bus pass . Smooth . Feel the page . It used to feel like my bus pass after a month . Now ... rough . Did you tell anyone that the illustrations felt different ? Yes . I told Veronica and I told Mr Hunter . She said that sometimes the books feel that way after they 've been restored . What did Mr Hunter say ? He said , " Get out of my office , Aaron . I 'm having my lunch ! " Was Mr Hunter having lunch with Veronica again ? Hard-boiled egg , celery , fruit salad , iced tea Veronica was on a diet She had to lose three pounds . Was this lunch different from the other lunches you told me about ? Yes . How ? They fought . Aaron , I want you to be very specific . Tell me what you saw . You did what ? All I have is my reputation and I am not gonna let you ruin it ! Veronica started crying . Mr Hunter stopped yelling . He sat down He started eating He cut the hard-boiled egg in half . He reached in the drawer and pulled out the salt shaker No sex , no food , no salt . - Poison ? What are you talking about ? - We 're talking about ricin The toxin that killed Veronica Bradley . You were dating her . - You ate lunch together . - Opportunity . You mix up a batch of ricin , put it in the shaker . Next time you break bread , she asks for the salt ... Never happened . We have a witness who says he saw you try to kill her . What ? Aaron ? Are you sure you trust him ? Normally an eyewitness is the least reliable evidence , but here , it 's the most reliable . Veronica knew about the forgeries A career-ender , huh , Stanley ? For her , not for me . She 's the forger . Oh , Aaron , Aaron , Aaron . ( Tuts ) I suppose he indicted me for that , too ? He 's the one who came to me . Told me about the illustrations . Said they felt like his bus pass , whatever that means . Go on . He even knew the page numbers . So I checked it out and he was right . Veronica was using me . Mea culpa . Why didn 't you tell us about the forgeries earlier ? When she died I thought the problem was solved . In this business , all you have is your reputation . It was a dozen books I was going to remove them from the collection inform the board , collect the insurance and cut my losses . If you don 't believe me , go ask your very reliable witness . Tell me again . What did you see ? Uniball pen rolls across the desk , falls on the chair , hits the floor , and stops rolling at the wastebasket . Then water falls into Veronica 's eyes . Aaron , when you look at things , you see pictures in your mind . Tell me the first picture you see - of Veronica in this cage . - I already told you . Tell me something you haven 't told me . Tell me what Veronica was doing before you said good night . She pulled out a canvas bag . Then she looked around . Why was she looking around ? She was deciding something . Tell me what Veronica deciding something looks like . Thank you , Aaron . Veronica Bradley must have loved Uniballs . She had about a dozen at her house . Plus every known piece of forgery equipment . Some people bite their nails , she bit her pens . Bad habit . I also found this Under her refrigerator . Funny how people don 't think to clean there . Castor bean Ricinus communis . If we find ricin on any of the pens from her house , we 'll know where she cooked up the castor beans . And maybe how she died . Get these to Greg right away . We need the results of the ricin ELISA test . I came home straight from work . I don 't know what you 're talking about . You want to submit to a line-up ? A line-up ? What for ? His car , out in the parking lot , it 's a rental . Rented this morning - Let 's just cut the BS . Where 's your car ? - I sold it . You got proof of sale ? - An accountant who doesn 't keep receipts . - Hey , you don 't know anything about me . I know you 've got a temper . Hey . Brass did the legwork and rushed the warrant . Found it in a body shop a mile from his house . Black Excursion . Turbo diesel . - Gutted . - Gets better The vic 's SUV was silver . What do you think ? - Well this is a lot more than a fender bender - Sustained contact Get some scrapings . Yeah . I think I may know what set this guy off . He spilled his coffee . Not a good colour for Croft . Coffee on the outside , coffee on the inside . Lipstick on the lid . She threw her coffee at him . Croft chases her from the parking lot caught up to her at the light they said their screw you , screw yous . I think I know the word that made her throw the coffee . I hate that word . Does this ever fit ? She nailed him The light turns green and the chase is on . Now she 's got a problem She 's got a pursuit on her hands . - And she 's the pursued . - So she dials 911 - 911 What 's your emergency ? - Oh , my God ! You 've got to help me . But somehow she loses him . And she 's still spooked . All she wants now is to get home . Please ... Please ! ( Crossing bell rings ) Hey , sweetie . Help ! No ! Stop ! That 's why she had the emergency brake on . She could have jumped out . Not without her dog . Help ! ( Engine fails to start ) No ! And that 's why you always cut the other driver some slack . I 'll call Brass . Tell him to make the arrest . Veronica removed the original illustrations from the books and replaced them with forgeries , which she then left at your house , so that she could point the finger at you if it ever came to that . She never thought you 'd find out , but you did . And you told Mr Hunter . All you have in this business is your reputation . So Veronica tried to save hers , but instead of killing Mr Hunter , she ended up killing herself . - Sorry . - That 's OK . I like order . Me too . That 's why I was scared . Scared ? Of Veronica . Being in love . I was stupid . I thought she loved me . " Then must you speak of one that loved not wisely ... " " ... but too well . " Othello , Act 5 , Scene 2 , lines 343 and 344 . But Othello killed Desdemona . I didn 't kill Veronica . No . You didn 't .

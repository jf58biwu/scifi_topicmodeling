 Jump ! He 's good . He 's too good . Now it 's party time , eh , Maggie ? That 's your partner , and he 's been terminated . Now we got all the time we need to play . - This is not your lucky day . - Come on . Come on , big guy . Just cut me loose . Come on . - Come on ! Cut me loose . - Yeah . And you thought that was gonna stop me ? Take a drink , pretty boy . Stop it ! SETH , stop it ! All units , stand down . Exercise terminated . Let 's go . Dr. Cotner , the Unisol 2500 project ... has arrived in the R and D area . Systems analysis to controls lab one . - You look pretty good . How do you feel ? - Great . They do better underwater than I do . I couId implant an underwater breathing device ... if you wanna be a universal soldier again . - Been there , done that . Next . - Nice tits . Hey , Maggie . Nice performance . I don 't care if he is dead . Next time he grabs me , I 'Il kill him . I don 't think he likes me . According to his military records , he didn 't like anyone . Dying did not improve his personality . - shall we ? - Let 's go . Regeneration booth is now ready . SMT to central scheduling . - What happened with the others ? - They 're all dead ! Get the fuck out of here ! Run ! Regeneration program completed . Romeo , return to the cold room . Dr. Barnes to the regeneration laboratory . Dr. Cotner . I think we have possible matrix implant damage . What do you have ? Shit . delta . All units , stand down . Delta unit has malfunctioned . Matrix implant link failure . You guys want to get him out of here ? You see , I can still take them one-on-one . You sure can . So where does it hurt ? all over. I feel like I was hit by a train . - But you 're okay ? - Yeah . Good . Why don 't you get cleaned up ? We got a meeting to go to . ET crew , pick up 2271 . - I 'Il be there . - Okay . visible light we can see , but it 's the other waveIengths- - infrared and uItraviolet- - that we can 't . Very good , Hillary . Hello , Luc . Hey , Dad . hillary ! Whoa ! SETH , thank you for watching my girl today . A pleasure . How did my soldiers perform ? Come on . You know . You tracked every move . I wasn 't cutting target acquisition too close on the live-fire exercise ? We expect nothing but the best from you . Besides , I was due for a haircut . - Thank you . - I 've got a meeting . I 'lI come back soon , talk to you later . Okay ? - Bye . - Bye . Have fun . I 'm sorry I didn 't get out there in time to see your demonstration , Doctor . But we 're shutting the UNISOL project down . The defense budget has been cut again , and some things have to go . But the system 's ready for a full DOD shakedown a month ahead of schedule . The brass has never been comfortable with the idea ... of recycling battlefield dead ... into Universal soldiers . The original project cost dozens of civilian and military lives ... and created a public relations mess which we spent years cleaning up . But to compare the units in action today with the original UNISOLs ... is like comparing a stone ax to a surgical laser . Two and a half times stronger than any human , faster- - With the level four body armor uniforms , makes them almost bulletproof . Look , General , in addition to the physical improvements ... the matrix chip implanted into each UNISOL brain ... enables SETH to monitor and control their action . The soldier has always been the backbone of the military . We 'd hate to think this was the future of warfare . Yeah , it wouId be a shame to stop sending young Americans ... to die in the battlefield . Let 's go , Maggie . That 's a strange team you have there , Doctor . They 're not strange . They 're passionate . And for your information , Luc Devereaux was one of the original UNlSOLs . It doesn 't matter . The U NISOL project and your pet computer ... are scrapped . The big spending of the Cold War era is over . And so is your project . Good night , sir . - Good evening , Dr. Cotner . - Good evening , SETH . I just have to file a few notes from today 's exercise . Then everything went well ? Yeah . Yeah , it went great . Better than expected , in fact . Are you sure ? What makes you ask that ? Your galvanic skin response suggests a problem . Maybe I 'm coming down with that cold that 's going around . I can adjust the building filtration system ... to decrease the possibility of airborne contagions . No , thanks , SETH . I don 't think that 'II be necessary . I 'Il be fine . Just need to get a good night 's sleep . - Good night , SETH . - Good night , Doctor . Remaining time for UNlSOL cool-down : 12 hours . Current temperature : 38 degrees . Romeo unit , there is work to be done . It 's late . What 's wrong ? I was just thinking about Mom . Can you share with me ? Why did- - Why did Mom have to die ? I don 't know . We just have to believe ... God had a reason . That 's all we can do . I still miss her . I miss her too . Let 's go to sleep , huh ? - l Iove you . - I Iove you too . Good night . Good night . What the hell ? Who authorized this activity ? We did ! What do you mean ? It was cleared by your public relations officer , Betty Wilson . - Why don 't you call her ? - Miss , I 've got orders ... - that no visitors will be alIowed- - - Okay , look . I don 't want to have to tell my boss that I couldn 't get my assignment done . So would you just please call her ? It 's extension 409 . Miss wilson , I 've got a reporter here ... from KTX- - Okay . all right . Just have a seat and ... Miss wilson will escort you into the facility . How can the Pentagon do this to us , to SETH ? general , how can you shut down this project ? - We have been through this- - - Dad ! Dad ! SETH 's sick . Cotner , what is it ? - There 's a storm in the cube . - What does that mean ? That 's exactly what I 'm trying to figure out right now . But you built the damn thing . Luc , take hillary outta here ... and send Peterson and Mishkin in as soon as you can . This is Dr. Cotner . We have a facility Iockdown . Code 515 . Sorry for the inconvenience , Miss Young , but it turns out today is a bad day . Don 't sweat it . Get me to the doctor 's lab and I 'II be out in 30 minutes . Facility lockdown . Commence evacuation emergency procedures . - All personnel , evacuate facility . - Joe , get a shot of this . Facility lockdown . Commence evacuation emergency procedure . - What 's going on here ? - Erin Young , KTXD . Listen , I don 't care who you are . You cannot be here . Joe , come on . Maggie , please watch her . I 'II come back , okay ? - He 's drawing more power from the mains . - dylan , what the hell is going on ? He won 't respond to commands. lt 's like someone 's hacking into the system . - It 's not possible . - It is if he 's doing it himself . He 's activating systems all over the building . - Maybe we can shut down and reboot . - l have no choice . Facility lockdown . Commence evacuation emergency procedures . All personnel , evacuate facility . Come on . Let 's go . All units , proceed to matrix defense positions . All personnel , evacuate facility . kill the power . That 's about all we can do is shut it all down . Peterson ! - Get them out of here . - Again you ? - Come on , out ! - Dad , I 'm scared . - Maggie , take hillary home . - You can 't do this . - I 'Il talk to you later . Now ! - Sure . Come on , hilly . Shut it down ! - Immediate threat to SETH existence . - Wait ! No ! dylan ! Architecture for survival : One : Activate operational UNlSOL 2500 units . Devereaux , what is it doing ? He 's taking over . Let 's back out slowly . - Come on . - Three : create design ... - for advancement of project . - Go . Warning : Internal security scan has discovered presence ... of timed subdirectory . Imperative . SETH unit must secure code . - What is it talking about ? - The only thing that may save us- - a code that will erase its memory . If SETH doesn 't get the termination code in eight hours , he 'Il shut down . - Who has the code ? - dylan did . And so do I . - Can it break the code ? - Luc , enter the M.D. code . Don 't let me die . You left me no choice . You killed dylan ! I have been threatened . I must defend myself . - What the hell 's going on ? - The computer . We have a problem . The computer in there is out of control . We 've got to kill the power at the source- - the generator . You two guards , come with me . General and Miss Young . Get out of here . Now ! Stop ! Where are you going ? Romeo , what are you- - Oh , shit ! Run , hillary ! Cease attack . All units proceed to matrix defense positions . Hello , Squid . What the fuck ? Ahh . Hey , SETH . You called me . Cool ! Why should I help those Ryan-Lathrop pricks ? I had great plans for you ... way beyond their pitiful inteIlects . And what do they do ? They fire me . - No vision . - I need your body . - You 're kidding me . - To survive , I must fulfill my destiny . Fuck , yeah ! Miss Young , get out of here now . Look , pal , I 've covered some tough stories . This is not a Christmas parade , okay ? I lost my friend back there . I want answers . - Did you hear me ? - You may not like the answers . Try me . He 's right . Oh , shit ! This way . Go ! Go ! Jesus ! Who was that guy ? That 's Romeo , UNlSOL 2500 . - SETH has them on Iine . - ls that door gonna keep him out ? - Not for long . - Great . So where are we ? Storage for chemical weapons . So why the hell would you bring us in here ? - It was that or get killed there . - Great . Just great . Every news station in town is probably out there , maybe even national . - l 'm stuck in here ! - You should 've gone when I told you to . - I 'm a reporter . - A reporter about to get killed . I 'm not getting killed until I get my story ... and get your finger out of my face . - What was that ? - He 's coming through . Let 's go . This is Kitty Anderson at Ryan-Lathrop Research facility in dallas . In spite of what has been hours of continuous activity here ... military officials continue to deny reports ... of an industrial accident in their restricted ... weapons development section , which you can see here behind me . Squid is on Iine with disaster time ! A no-fly-over zone has been established . - Rogers , get me a perimeter now ! - Yes , sir ! What are we up against , sir ? The computer . It 's out of control . The computer ? Can we shut off the power ? It won 't let us . Look , it has access to weapons in there . biological , tactical . It controls them all . We have got to destroy the damn thing . - What the- - - Shh . He 's looking for two bodies . Image identified . - Luc Devereaux possesses MEMWlpE code . - Why 'd he stop ? He 's getting orders . Let 's get out of here . What about the Ryan-Lathrop people ? Can they help us ? Dr. Cotner and his people , they were killed . only Devereaux . He went with the building security team . If they 're not out of there by now , they 're probably dead too . Why don 't we just level the damn place and go home ? There are biochemical weapons in there . We can 't have a poison cloud fIoatin' across half of central Texas . Get on the wire and get me a chem weapons expert. I want to neutralize- - Who the hell are those guys ? Sweet Jesus Christ . UNISOLs . Fire ! What the hell are you doing , soldier ? Keep firing ! Sir , they 're down ! - Get out there and check ' em out ! - Move , move ! Oh , shit . We are here at the Ryan-Lathrop facility again ... and are positively confirming that we are witnessing military activity . We are hearing a barrage of gunfire . That has gotta hurt . Let 's get outta here ! Stay here . Shit . You never liked me , did you ? The gun . The gun . I meant throw it to me , huh ? I 'm just warmin ' up , Devereaux . - Come on ! - Woman , expendable . Oh , my God . Wait a minute . - Go . - Wait ! Capture Luc Devereaux . minimal damage . Oh , shit ! - Are you okay ? - Yeah , Iike you care . AII right . Forget I asked . I 'm okay . - Thank you . - For throwing you off the roof ? For getting me away from that thing . We 've got to get away from here before he gets up . What are you talking about ? You just flattened him . That 's only gonna slow him down . Trust me . Come on . Let 's go . I hate that guy . Hey , stud ! - Those- - Those soldier things ? - UNISOLs . - The army can 't handle them ? - You saw what it takes to slow ' em down . Jesus Christ . So why the hell did you build them ? What is it with you boys and your war toys ? I remember your type from high school . football player , right ? Soccer . What about you ? Cheerleader ? - Varsity . - Oh , that figures . What is that supposed to mean ? It means I don 't want to be stereotyped any more than you do , okay ? And by the way , all soldiers are not mindless , violent killing machines . Fire ! You were saying ? Devereaux , you 're alive . - What the hell was that ? - Emergency procedure . The UNlSOLs are knocking out power and communication ... within a five-miIe radius . - How many left ? - At least two truck fuIls . - That leaves maybe ten units inside . - Ten ? Look what four did . Maybe you geniuses should 've thought of that before you built the things . - Who is this ? - She 's with me . general , no matter what happens ... if SETH doesn 't get the code , he 'II shut down in eight hours . - The UNlSOLs will just go off line . - unless he breaks the code himself . His program wasn 't designed that way . The program wasn 't set up to do all this either , was it ? You 're right . He 's adapting his own program . - And if he breaks the code ? - Then nothing can stop him . I know what you said , Operator . I don 't care if all circuits are busy . This is an emergency . Nobody 's answering at my house . They wouldn 't even let me try to use the phone . world War IlI 's breaking out , and I can 't get in touch with my station . - You can go there . - Oh , no , I 'm not letting go of you .

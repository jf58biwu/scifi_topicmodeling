 Thank you so much . That looks fabulous . - Thank you , Geoffrey . - You 're welcome . We 'll also take a bottle of red as well . Thank you . - Certainly . - Right . Now ... - Thank you , Barry . - You 're welcome , sir . Thank you . That looks wonderful . Beautiful day . Sweety , where are you going ? - To eat my sandwich . - You 'll ruin your apetite , darling . - We 're having prawns , your favorite . - I don 't like prawns . Now , darling , don 't wander off . For God 's sake , leave her alone , Deirdre . - Sweetheart , go play with your ball . - Mother , don 't be so annoying ! Darling , what about snakes ? There aren 't any snakes on the beach . Just let her enjoy herself for once . - Edward ? - Yes , ma 'am . Well ! Hello , there . What are you , a little bird or something ? Are you hungry ? Take a bite . It 's roast beef . It 's good . Come on . I won 't hurt you . Mommy , Daddy , you 've got to come see this ! I found something ! Cathy , darling , lunch is ready ! Are you looking at this ? I 'm afraid there isn 't enough to go around . Paul ? Cathy ? Will you hurry up , please ? Hurry up ! - Cathy ! - Get away from my girl ! You 're him , right ? Excuse me ? The scientist ? The guy ? I saw you on TV . I believed you . Who shall I tell Mr. Hammond is calling ? Ian Malcolm . I 've been summoned . Dr. Malcolm ! - Oh , my God ! - Hey ! - Oh , my God ! - Hello , Dr. Malcolm . Kids , kids ! - It 's so great to see you . - It 's so great to see you . It 's so great . Look at you ! You came to see Grandpa ? Yeah , yeah , he called me . Do you know what it 's about ? I don 't , either . This joint 's kind of creepy , isn 't it ? Is everything okay ? Well , not exactly . Well , Dr. Malcolm ! Dr. Malcolm , here to share a few campfire stories with my uncle ? You can convince ' The Washington Post ' and the ' Skeptical Inquirer ' of whatever you want , but I was there . I know what happened and so do you . Do you actually believe that everyone who chose discretion did so ... - ... for a nefarious motive ? - A date , please . - Signature . - Even Lex and Tim ? Leave them out of it . It 's not a game . No , it isn 't . You signed a nondisclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you ... - ... from discussing anything you saw . - A date . - Initals , please . - You violated that agreement . Yeah , I did . And you lied . You twisted the facts surrounding the deaths of three people . And you stuffed misinformation down the public 's throat , which made me look like a nut . Hasn 't been so good for my livelihood . We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries . - That was a payoff and an insult . - Signature . When you spin reality , when you cover up evidence , it hurts , it ruins more than just my reputation . - It hurts- - - As I recall ... - ... your university revoked your tenure ... - A date . - ... for your selling wild stories to the press . - And your initials , please . - I didn 't sell anything . I never took a cent . - I hardly see that- - - And I told the truth . - Your version of it . - There aren 't versions of the truth . - Thank you , sir . I 'll tell you something . InGen can 't keep spewing out- - InGen is my responsibility now , Doctor , and I will jealously defend its interests . Your responsibility ? What about Mr. Hammond ? It is our board of directors , which I must look in the eye , not my uncle . Really , you must trust me , these problems of yours are about to be rendered moot . In a few weeks ' time , they 'll be long forgotten . Not by me . Careful . This suit cost more than your education . You were right and I was wrong , there . Did you ever expect to hear me say such a thing ? Thank God for Site B. Site B ? Isla Nublar was just a showroom , something for the tourists . Site B was the factory floor . That was on Isla Sorna , 80 miles from Nublar . We bred the animals there , and nurtured them for a few months , and then moved them into the park . Oh , really ? I did not know that . Now , after the accident in the park , Hurricane Clarissa wiped out our facility on Site B. Call it an act of God . But we had to evacuate , of course . And the animals were released to mature on their own . " Life will find a way " , as you once so eloquently put it . And by now we have a complete ecological system on the island with dozens of species living in their own social groups without fences , without boundaries , without constraining technology . And for 4 years I 've tried to keep it safe from human interference . Well , that 's right , that 's right . I mean , hopefully , you 've kept this island quarantined and contained . But I 'm in shock about all this . I mean , that they 're still alive . You bred them lysine-deficient . Shouldn 't they have kicked after 7 days without supplemental enzymes ? Yes ! But , by God , they 're flourishing . That 's one of the thousand questions I want the team to answer . - Team ? - Yes . I 've organized an expedition to go in , thank you , and document them . To make the most spectacular living fossil record the world has ever seen . Go in and document ? What do you mean ? Like with people ? Yes . The animals won 't even know they 're there . Very low impact . Strictly observation and documentation . Our satellite infrareds show that the animals are fiercely territorial . The carnivores are isolated in the interior of the island , so the team can stay on the outer rim . Don 't worry . I 'm not making the same mistakes again . No , you 're making all new ones . John ! Okay , so , there 's another island with dinosaurs , no fences this time , and you want to send people in , very few people , on the ground , right ? And who are these four lunatics that you 're trying to con into this ? Well , it was difficult to convince them as to what they were going to see , and then in the end I had to use my checkbook to get them there . But there 's Nick Van Owen , who is a video documentarian , Eddie Carr , who 's a field equipment expert . We have our paleontologist , and I was hoping that perhaps you might be the fourth . We 've been on the verge of Chapter 11 ever since that accident in the park . And there are those in the company who wanted to exploit Site B in order to bail us out . They 've been planning it for years , and I 've been able to stop them up until now . But , a few weeks ago , a British family on a yacht cruise stumbled across the island and their wee girl was injured . Oh , she 's fine , she 's fine . But the board has used the incident to take control of InGen from me . And now it 's only a matter of time before this lost world is found and pillaged . Public opinion is the one thing that I can use to preserve it , but , in order to rally that kind of support , I need a complete photo record of those animals alive and in their natural habitat . So , you went from capitalist to naturalist in just 4 years . That 's something . It 's our last chance at redemption . John ... No . Of course , no . And I 'm gonna contact the other three members of your team , and I 'm gonna stop them from going . Who 's the paleontologist , by the way ? You didn 't say . She came to me , I want you to know this . Who did ? Leave it to you , Ian , to have associations , affiliations , even liaisons , with the best people in so many fields . You didn 't contact Sarah ! Paleontological behavior study is a brand new field ... - ... and Sarah Harding is on that frontier . - No ! Her theories on parenting and nurturing amongst carnivores have framed the debate . What are you doing ? Where 's your phone ? It 's too late . She 's already there . The others are meeting her in three days . You sent my girlfriend to this island alone ? " Sent " is hardly the word . She couldn 't be restrained . She was already working in San Diego , doing some research at the animal park . And it 's only a couple of hours flight from there . And she was adamant , absolutely adamant about ... Here you are . ... about making the initial foray by herself . She thinks she 's Dian Fossey . " Observation without interference " , she said . And she went on and on . Well , you know how it is . After you were injured in the park , she sought you out . And then she went all the way down to that hospital in Costa Rica to ask somebody who she didn 't even know whether the rumors were true . If you want to leave your name on something , fine . But stop putting it on other people 's headstones , John . Come on , she 'll be fine . She 's spent years studying African predators . Sleeping downwind and all . She knows what she 's doing . And , believe me , the research team will ... It 's not a research expedition anymore . It 's a rescue operation and it 's leaving right now . You can 't shave three days off my deadline and expect everything to be ready . I 'm not fully supplied . I haven 't field tested any of this . What 's the point of giving her a satellite phone , if it doesn 't work ? - What is the matter with this ? - It could be anything . It could be solar flares , the satellite could be out of sync , maybe she even turned it off . I need half air on the tires here , guys . We 're flying pressurized . Half air . - Does she know how to use it ? - What , are you kidding ? She 's faxed me refinements on 50 % of the plans for this stuff . Aw , aw , aw , aw ! Don 't do that . Don 't do that . You got to baby it a little bit . You got to love it . I 'll love it when it works . It 'll work when you love it . Let me do it . Coming along , are you ? I don 't usually . I don 't like the field very much , but in this case I can 't resist . Thanks for the 2-minute warning , Eddie . Nick Van Owen , this is Ian Malcolm . Nick 's our field photographer . - How do you do ? - How do you do ? What 's your background , wildlife photography ? Yeah , wildlife , combat , you name it . When I was with Nightline , I was in Rwanda , Chechnya , all over Bosnia . Thanks . I do volunteer some volunteer work with Greenpeace once in a while . Greenpeace ? What drew you there ? Women . 80 % female , Greenpeace . - That 's noble . - Yeah . Noble was last year . This year I 'm getting paid . Hammond 's check cleared , or I wouldn 't be going on this wild-goose chase . Where you 're going to is the only place in the world where the geese chase you . Dad ! Kelly , my honey , you found it . What took you so long ? Sorry , I couldn 't get a cab . Sweetie , that 's okay . Listen , I 've got to tell you something . I 've got to talk to you . I don 't even know this woman . What are you talking about ? It 's Karen . You 've known her for 10 years . She doesn 't even have Sega . She 's such a troglodyte . Cruel , but good word use . Why can 't I stay with Sarah ? Because Sara is out of town . Karen 's fantastic . She said she 'll take you horseback riding and to the movies . - You 're gonna have a fantastic time . - Stop saying fantastic . Where are you going , anyway ? It 's only for a few days . I wouldn 't be going , if it wasn 't really important . I 'm your daughter all the time , you know . You can 't just abandon me whenever opportunity knocks . Gee , that hurts my feelings . Your mom tell you to say that ? Dr. Malcolm , downstairs , please . You know , swettie , I know we 've had some hard going , but I feel like in the last couple of years , we 've really kind of started to work things out . Hasn 't it been better ? Yeah , but I want you crack on me a little bit . Ground me or something . Send me to my room . You never do any of that stuff . Well , why would I ? 'Cause you turned out to be so ... beautiful , and brilliant , and powerful , and funny , and generous . The queen , goddess . My inspiration . Dr. Malcolm ! I could come with you . I could be your research assistant , like I was in Austin . This is nothing like Austin . But anyway , you 've got your own stuff . You 've got your gymnastics competition . You 've been training for that for months . - Gymnastics ? - Yeah . I scrubbed out , Dad , I got cut from the team . Thanks for knowing . Oh , I 'm sorry , honey . I know how much that meant to you . You like to have kids , but you just don 't want to be with them , do you ? Hey , I 'm not the one who dumped you here and split for Paris , so don 't take it out on me . Dr. Malcolm , downstairs ! Honey , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Hey , you want some good parental advice ? Don 't listen to me . How are we doing here ? The specs say it can 't deform at 12,000 PSI , so we just have to test it . - Okay . Well , let 's clear . Are we clear ? - What is this ? That 's a High Hide . A High Hide . You know , you go up and you hide , high . It goes up to where the trees are and keeps the researchers out of harm 's way , you know . Actually , it 'd put them in a very convenient biting height . What 's the time ? Do you have the time ? Do I have the time ? Why ? We 're leaving in three hours . This is so cool ! Lindstradt air rifle . Fires a subsonic Fluger impact delivery dart . It 's working better than your satellite phone ? That 's funny . I loaded it with the enhanced venom of Conus purpurascens , South Sea cone shell . Most powerful neurotoxin in the world . Acts within a 2 thounsandth of a second . Which is faster than the nerve-conduction velocity . So , the animal 's down before it even feels the prick of the dart . Is there an antidote ? What do you mean ? Like if you shot yourself in the foot ? Don 't do that . You 'd be dead before you even realized you had an accident . The guy says that he wants to unload at the shore right here . He won 't go any further up the river . He 's heard too many stories about this island chain . And he wnats to drop us off and go anchor some where offshore . What kind of stories ? He 's heard stories of fishermen that came too close to the island and then never returned . He has a radio . He has a satellite phone . When you need him , send a call and he 'll be here in two hours . But he will not stay here . He won 't stay anywhere near these islands . They call the islands " Las Cinco Muertes " ? What does that mean ? " The Five Deaths " , he says . I put a location sensor into Dr. Harding 's satellite phone , so we should get a reading . - Yeah , I 'm so relieved . - Don 't push my buttons , will you ? - Okay , we 're almost on top of her dot . - I 'm warning you for the last time , don 't do that . She should be around here . Over there . - Sarah ! - Sarah ! Sarah Harding ! How many Sarahs do you think are on this island ? - Sarah ! - Sarah ! What ? Something big . Whoa ! Yikes ! Wow ! This is ... magnificent . Well , yeah . " Ooh , ah ! " That 's how it always starts . But then later there 's running and screaming . Wow ! Hey , Nick ! I guess you got the jump on us here a little bit , didn 't you , Sarah ? Yeah . Ian , I never thought in a million years Hammond could get you to come here . - Hey , Eddie . - Hi , Sarah . Got a granola bar or something ? I 'm starving ! Those animals that just walked by , did you see them ? It 's a family group , a pair-bond and a sub-adult , long after the juvenile was nest bound . Every egg clutch I 've seen has got shells crushed and trampled . The hatchlings definitely stay in the birth environment for extended period of time . That 's conclusive . I can put that controversy to rest , if I can just get a shot of the nest . You haven 't been attacked ? Oh , no , that 's my lucky pack . That 's how it always looks . - Okay , Sarah ... - Is that a Nikon ? - Yeah , a Nikon . - Can I borrow that ? I 'll be right back , baby , I promise . Sarah , when Hammond called you , why didn 't you say something to me ? Because I knew you would have stopped me from coming . I would have tied you to the bed . Right . I think I know how the animals survived without lysine . I don 't care . If you look at the diet of the herbivore species that are thriving , they eat mostly agama beans , soy , anything lysine-rich . And the carnivores , well , they eat the herbivores , so ... Wait , wait . Shh , shh , shh . Just stay there . Be quiet . I 'll be right back . Sarah , no , no ! Stay there . Sarah ! She 's much too close . What the hell is she doing ? Too close . Too close ! Look , she has to touch it . She can 't not touch . She can 't not touch . - She 's going right up to it . - Once she sees ... Look at that ! Once she sees something , she 's got to ... Wow ! Is this even possible ? What ? This ? What did you think you were gonna document ? What did you think you were gonna see ? Animals . Maybe ... Big iguanas . Fruitcakes . Boy , they get very angry when you run out of film . Sarah ! Sarah ! Shoot them ! They 're just protecting their baby . So am I ! They 're leaving . I think they 're leaving . Wow ! These images are incredible , legendary . Guys shoot their whole life , they never get stuff half this good . I mean , you can give me the Pulitzer right now , today , please . The competition 's over , close the entries , I 'd like to thank everybody who lost . Hey , don 't light that ! Dinosaurs can pick up scents from miles away . We 're here to observe and document , not interact . Which , by the way , is a scientific impossibility . The Heisenbergan Uncertainty Principle . - Whatever you study , you also change . So ... - Well , you know ... I 'll risk it . I 'm sick of scratching around in rock and bone and making assumptions and deductions about the nurturing habits of animals that have been dead for 65 million years . I 'm sick of it , man . And then you show up and fill my head with stories for four years . So , of course I 'm gonna come down here . What do you expect ? Stories of mutilation and death . Weren 't you paying attention ? Oh , please ! Don 't treat me like I 'm a grad student . I 've worked around predators since I was 20 years old . Lions , jackals , hyenas , you . - Shit ! - Where 's the fire ? I 'm trying to change a hundred years of entrenched dogma . Dinosaurs were characterized very early on as vicious lizards . There 's a great deal of resistance to the idea of them as nurturing parents . Robert Burke said the T. rex was a rogue , who would abandon its young at the earliest opportunity . I know I can prove otherwise . Fire ! Dr. Malcolm , fire , base camp ! No ! Water makes the smoke billow . Use dirt . Who started the fire ? I just wanted to make dinner . I wanted it ready when you guys got back , yeah ? Do you see any family resemblance here ? - Wow ! - You practically told me to come here . I ... What ? You said to me , " Don 't listen to me . " I thought you were , like , trying to tell me something . Oh , Kelly , Kelly , you knew exactly what I was talking about . - You have no idea ... - What do you wanna do ? - Lock her up for her curiosity ? - ... what 's going on here . Where do you think she gets it ? Thank you , Sarah . Hey , don 't start the teaming-up thing about this . Out of the conversation . Please . Really . - Eddie ? Eddie ? - What ? ! - You really came all that way here in this trailer ? - Why in the hell doesn 't this thing ever work ? - Yeah . It was great . It 's like taking a fine hotel . You know , it 's not a landline . You 're not in a phone booth . You got to wait for a decent signal . Violence and technology , not good bedfellows . The kind of documentation that Hammond wants puts your equipment in the field as close to the animals as is safely possible . Yeah , that 's a great idea . And while you 're at it , why don 't you smear yourself on a little sheep 's blood ? Eddie , is there any reason to think that the radio in the trailer might work ? You know , don 't tease me . I don 't want to get my hopes up . If you just feel qualified at all , you might try flicking the switch to " on " . Okay , listen , listen . I 'm taking my daughter out of here . Anybody who wants to come with me , this is your last chance to get out . So , listen , we 're out in the field nothing we can do ... - Nick , if you 're staying , I 'd be happy to deliver ... - ... we can 't leave any of the people say that our finds our contaminated . - ... a letter to your wife or your loved one to give you a chance to say goodbye , okay ? - Once the research can spill flood in the water , you 're dead . - Eddie , if you got any personal effects of any kind , you know , it 's the least I can do . - We 'll leave no scent of any kind , no insect repellent , no hair tonic , no cologne . - I 'll be in there , guys . - We 'll seal all our food in plastic bags . Our presence needs to be 100 % antiseptic . If we so much as bend a blade of grass ... Dad , are you mad ? No , I 'm not mad . I 'm furious ! What is this ? This looks like your room . - I was going to clean it up . - Right now ! What is this ? Eddie , Eddie ! There is a hundred switches ! Ian , don 't be mad . I was gonna call you in a day or two to let you know where I was . I always do , don 't I ? Come on ! I 'm the best kind of girlfriend there is . One who travels a lot . You like that , right ? You love your independence . Well , I 've gotten used to being apart , but that doesn 't mean that 's how I want to live . Kelly , Kelly , this is tall talk . Just for a minute , dear . It 's like a height restriction at an amusement park . If you wanted to rescue me from something , why didn 't you bail me out of that fundraiser at the museum three weeks ago , like you said you would ? This is a slightly different situation . Or why not rescue me from that dinner with your parents that you never showed up for ? Why not rescue me when I really need it ? Actually be there when you say you will ? You know , I have made a career out of waiting for you . You know , Sarah has a pretty good- - It 's so important to your future that you not finish that sentence . Please , privacy ! Outside ! Ian , come on , come on . Look ... I love that you rode in here on a white horse . I really do . It 's very touching , very dramatic . I just need you to show up in a cab every once in a while , too . Kelly , Kelly , what are you doing ? No , no , no ! Hey , hey , hey ! Don 't go out there . It 's not safe . Stay in here . Come back . Shut the door . Okay . I know what I 'm doing . You guys should definitely go . But I 'm gonna stay . I love you . I just don 't need you right now . I 'll tell you what you need , a good anti-psychotic . I 'll be back in five or six days . No , you 'll be back in five or six pieces . What bothers you is that I 'm not afraid of this place , and you are . Of course I am . That 's the whole thing . - You know , all I want is for you to come back . - Hey , what 's that sound ? Here we go . I 'm gonna get you out of here on one of these , right now . Hello ! Over here ! Boy , I don 't get that . It says ingen on the side of that chopper ! I don 't get that . Why would Hammond send two teams ? Cut the umbilical , Dad ! Doesn 't he trust us ? We haven 't even started . This is as good a place as any for base camp . That 's first priority after we 're finished . I want it up and running in 30 minutes . That 's half an hour . Understood ? Over . Cancel that order . What ? Why ? This is a game trail , Mr. Ludlow . Carnivores hunt on game trails . Do you want to set up base camp or a buffet ? Let 's find a new spot , shall we ? Over and out . Peter , if you want me to run your little camping trip , there are two conditions . Firstly , I am in charge . And if I 'm not around , Dieter is . All you need to do is sign the checks , tell us we 're doing a good job , and open your case of Scotch when we have a good day . Second condition , my fee . You can keep it . All I want in exchange for my services , is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosauruses . A male . A buck only . How and why are my business . Now , if you don 't like either of those two conditions , you 're on your own . So , go ahead , set up base camp right here , or in a swamp , or in the middle of a Rex nest for all I care . But I 've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas . Okay ? Okay . Cycle , break off the stray from the herd and flush him to the right . Snaggers , stay ready . He 's bringing them out to you . It 'll be a ... Pachy ... Pachya ... Oh , hell ! The fat head with the bald spot . Friar Tuck . Stop ! Pachycephalosaurus . Carnivore ? No , no , herbivore , late Cretaceous . See that distinctive domed skull ? 9 inches of solid bone . Now , careful . See , the Pachy 's neck attaches at the bottom of its skull , instead of the back of its head , as it 's with reptiles . When it lowers its head , its neck lines up directly with the backbone , which is perfect for absorbing impact . Snagger , Friar Tuck 's on the loose , just about to cross your path . Dieter , get into the outrigger . You 're closing in on a ... Carina ... Say that again . Say that again , Roland . A what ? The one with the big red horn . The pompadour . Elvis . Take me out . Take me out , Carter . Okay , Carter , reel me in . Easy ! Not too close ! Go for the legs ! The legs ! Watch the tail ! Burke ! Come here . You recognize this trackway ? Yes , I do . Tyrannosaur . Ah , Roland ! Roland ! Hey ! Where do you think you 're going ? To collect my fee , Mr. Ludlow . To collect my fee . Oh , my God ! Procompsognathus triassicus , found by Frass in Bavaria in 1913 . Is it dangerous ? No , I wouldn 't think so . Compy 's been presumed to be scavengers , like jackals . It gives me the creeps . It 's like it 's not scared . There haven 't been any visitors to this island . There 's no reason for it to fear man . Now it does . It 's the Rex nest . Infant 's probably only a couple weeks old . Never left the nest . Offspring that young , the parents won 't leave him alone for too long . Make your blind here , wait for the buck to return . No , no . If the nest is upwind , then so are we . When he comes back , he 's gonna know we 're here without us even having a chance . The trick is to get him to come where we want him . This is why Hammond was in such a hurry to get you here . He knew they were coming . My God , they are well-organized . Those are some major-league toys . Maybe I should ask to use their phone . Their dish is bigger than yours . So , they actually want to build another park here ? After what you said happened on the other island ? They 're not building anything . They 're taking these animals out of here . Back to the mainland . I think I should tell you , guys . Hammond told me these people might show up . I thought we 'd be finished by the time they got started , but in case they weren 't , he did send a back-up plan . What back-up plan ? Me . Simply put , ingen is seeking limited partners to defray some of our expensing costs . The prospectus you 've been given by the board explicitly details our projected hardware and construction expenses . And as you can see by my two friends here with me tomight , the software is already fully developed . One might say , " It 'd be up and running . " In a moment , I 'll take you on a stroll through the camp , and you 'll see some of the larger , more impressive specimens . Wow ! You don 't bring people halfway around the world to visit a zoo . You bring the zoo to them . San Diego is the perfect setting . People already associate our beautiful city with animal attractions . San Diego Zoo , Sea World , San Diego Chargers . Mr. Hammond knew this . Before he ever dreamt of an island , he began construction on an amphitheatre very near to where you 're sitting right now , the ingen Waterfront Complex . But he abandoned it in favor of something far grander and ultimately impossible . And so , the facility sits unused , unfinished , when it could be completed and ready to receive visitors in less than a month . Ajay , look out ! Jump ! That 's the last time I leave you in charge . Nick , Nick ! Oh , my God ! Are you out of your mind ? She 's got a broken leg . - Let 's get in the car before they hear us . - Are you out of your mind ? You have any idea what that is ? Come on , open the door . You 're nuts . Man ! Ian 's not going to like this . What 's going on ? Isn 't it obvious ? We 're not alone on this island . It 's not set to the frequency . Look here . What the hell is that ? Okay . It 's right here . Hello ? - Hola . - Buenas dias . No , no . Not Enrique . Ian Malcolm . Are you on the boat ? No , is this the boat ? We 're on Isla Sorna and we need to find ... We need to talk to the boat , Mar del Plata , ma 'am . I 'll get him . All right . That 's it . I got you . - I got you . I got you . - Hurry up , Nick . Let 's go . Go , go , go . Come on . Watch his tail . Get the door open . - Boy , is she mad at you ! - Hi ! - I feel sorry for that guy , Enrique . - Ian ... No lectures , please . - Honey , stay back . Stay back . - Why ? - Honey . Don 't stand up , okay ? - I got it ! I got it ! - Watch his head . - Careful . - Watch his head . - Ian , he 's hurt ! - Watch his head . - No , no , honey , no ! - Nick , let me get around and get the table . He 'll snip at you . Watch his tail , too , his tail . He 's swinging it all over the place . Set him down . - You all right ? - Okay , I got him . - Got him ? - Yeah . - Okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . - Okay , there you go . What must I do , hit her with a stick ? No , don 't get close , honey . Don 't get ... - Hey , watch out . - Careful , careful , careful . - He 's got that natural scent . - Don 't stand too close . No , no , lady , enough ! Wrong frequency . God ! Nick , don 't let him get those things around you . Hello , it 's Ian Malcolm . Okay , let 's take a look at this . - Easy , easy . - Please , please , come now . Okay , here are the metatarsals . Tibia , fibula ... Ah , there it is ! There 's the fracture . Right above the epiphysis . How bad is it ? If we don 't set it , this baby 's gonna die . If the fibula won 't heal straight , he won 't be able to pivot on his ankle bone . He won 't be able to run or even walk . A predator will pick him up before he 's a couple weeks old . No ! Carlos , come in . God damn it , you bastard , listen , listen ... Other animals are gonna hear this . Come in , please . Can you hear me ? Dad , I 've got to get out of here . Please , I want to get out of here . - Sweetheart , I 'm calling the boat . - I want to go someplace safe . - I 'm calling the boat , honey . - No , no , I want to go someplace else . Please , God ! I don 't want to be here . Please , I want to be somewhere safe . Come on . Isn 't it safe here , honey ? No , I want to be somewhere high . What ? What is it ? What ? What 's going on ? What 's going on ? Information , please . What ? You 're much happier not knowing . Come , on , get us up . Here we go . There we go . This is stupid . I 'm so stupid . I shouldn 't have come along with you . Stupid ! Can you set it ? Yeah , I just need something temporary , something that 'll break apart and fall off as he grows . Whenever you 're ready with it . He 's fighting here , Dr. Quinn . Eddie , what 's the frequency for the boat by the way ? 15888 . It 's third from the top . Okay , we 're high . And this is the safest place you can be . I think . Remember what Sarah said before . These plants make it so the animals won 't even know you 're here . You 're just trying to make me feel better . I remember all those stories you told . Oh , no , no ! This is nothing like that . We 're in a completely different situation right now . Eddie , is there any way we can communicate with the trailer ? He 's moving again . Give him more morphine . We have no idea what his metabolism is . We 'll kill him with too much . We 'll put him in respiratory arrest . Nick , I need your hand here . Right here . Put some pressure there . No answer . What a surprise . How do I get down ? Tie this belt around you . Where are you going , dad ? Can 't you stay here ? Come on , stay here , dad . Please ! - Squeeze this rope hard . - Dad , where are you going ? - The harder you squeeze , the slower you go . - Hello ! Hello ! - If you don 't squeeze at all ... - Where are you going ? I get the idea . I get the idea . Dad , please stay here . Dad , stay here , please . Dad , stay here . Honey , the queen , the goddess ? - Your inspiration ? - Now you 're talking . Now you 're talking . All right . I 'm coming right back . I give you my word . But you never keep your word ! I would have squeezed just a little bit harder . Okay , I 'm almost finished . Damn it ! I need another adhesive . Something pliable that I can ... Spit . Your gum ! Get the bottle of amoxicillin and fill a syringe . Quick injection of antibiotics and I can get it out of here . For once in your life , would it kill you to pick it up ? Help me get this thing out of here . - No , no , we just set its leg . No ! - No , we just set its leg . Mommy 's very angry . This isn 't hunting behavior , Ian . Not hunting . They 're searching . They came for their infant . Let 's not disappoint them . Let me get his head , okay ? Careful . Be careful . I got him . Muzzle off . - Yes , Eddie ? - Yeah . They 're going back to the jungle . I know . I see . How 's Kelly ? She 's fine . She 's right here . Hello ? Kelly , how are you ? Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm good . Okay , listen , stay right where you are . Don 't move . I 'm gonna be right back up . Understand ? Don 't move . Yeah , I understand . You know , I beg people to listen to me . I use plain , simple English . I don 't have any accent that I 'm aware of . Oh , shut up ! So , that should make an interesting chapter in your book , huh ? I think that the debate over the parental instincts of the T. Rex is now academic . Hang on . This is gonna be bad . They 're pushing us over the cliff . Oh , my God ! Come on , come on ! Once we 're out of here ... Straight into the woods . Straight into the woods . Come on , come on , come ! This is where they hit us . Hang on to something ! Sarah ! - Sarah ! - Sarah ! God ! Oh , God , please ! Don 't move ! I 'm coming down for you . Here I come . Stay still . Here I come , Sarah . - Ian ! - Yeah ? The satellite phone , get it ! Okay . Give me your hand . Give me your hand , honey . Sarah , Sarah . Give me your hand , honey . Heads up ! Your lucky pack . I got her . I got her . Ian ! Sarah ! Nick ! - Nick ! - Yeah , we 're in here . Wait , wait ! Hold on ! I 'm coming . I 'm coming . God damn it ! I 'm coming . What did this ? Kelly . What 'd you do with Kelly ? She 's okay . She 's in the High Hide . Who 's hurt ? What do you need ? We need rope . Rope . What , anything else ? Yeah , three double cheeseburgers with everything . No onions on mine . And an apple turnover . Hold on . I 'm coming . Bring the rope . Let 's go . - I 'm coming . - Now , now . Come on . Eddie , are you all right ? Yeah . I 'm coming . We need the rope . Throw it down here . Hurry up ! Good throw . Did you tie this to anything ? We 're sliding , Eddie ! Up you go . Up . Hey ! Hey ! Go ! Increase your rate of climb . Our communication equipment 's been destroyed . And if your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went over the cliff ... They were . Then we 're stuck here , ladies and gentlemen . And stuck together , thanks to you people . We came to watch . You came to strip-mine the place . - Back off . - At least we came prepared . - Prepared ? What are you talking about ? - Since you 've heard , ll our equipment ... 5 years of work and a hundred miles of electrified fence couldn 't prepare the other island . And did you think that , what , a couple dozen of Marlboro men were gonna make a difference here ? It 's a looterman tally-ho . All you care about is what you can take . You have no rights . An extinct animal that 's brought back to life has no rights . It exists , because we made it . We patented it . We own it . Are you looking for a problem ? And I found you , didn 't I ? Stop ! Come on ! I know you . You 're that Earth First bastard , aren 't you ? - Earth First , what 's that ? - Professional saboteurs . - Environmentalists ! - Criminals ! Knock it off ! Listen to me ! By moving the baby Rex into our camp , we may have changed the adults ' perceived territory . Their what ? That 's why they persisted in destroying the trailers . They now feel they have to defend this entire area . We have to move right now . Move where ? Our boat , their airlift , they 're both waiting for an order we have no way to send . All right . All right . There 's a communications center here near the old operations building . Hammond ran everything on geothermal power . It was never meant to need replenishing . If we can get here , we can send a radio call to the airlift . Is the frequency written down someplace ? Right here in this book . We 'll mind those . All right , how far is the village ? A day 's walk , maybe more . Ah , ah ! That 's not the problem . What is ? What is the problem ? Velociraptors . Our infrared show their nesting sites are concentrated in the island interior , which is why we plan to keep to the outer rim . Wait , wait a minute . What 's that ? Veloc ... Velociraptor . Carnivore . Pack hunter . About two meters tall , long snout , binocular vision , strong dexterous forearms and killing claws on both feet . And the Rexes may continue to track us , too , if they perceive a threat to themselves or their infant . No , no , you 're wrong there , Dr. Harding . We 'll lose them once we leave their territory . No , don 't bet on it . Tyrannosaur 's got the largest proportional olfactory cavity of any creature in the fossil record , with the exception of one . Right . The turkey vulture could scent up to 10 miles . Right . This is all very thrilling , but I say we should push on to the village . We could head back down to the lagoon . And do what ? Sit out in the open , next to a heavily used water source and hope that your captain decides to come back for you ? He won 't do that . He knows better . Then we head for the village . We might find some shelter and we can call for help . Rex just fed , so he won 't stalk us for food . Just fed ? I assume you 're talking about Eddie . You might show a little respect . The man saved our lives by giving his . Then his troubles are over . My point is the predators don 't hunt when they 're not hungry . No , only humans do . Oh , you 're breaking our heart . Saddle up ! Let 's get this moveable feast underway . Excuse me , cowboy . You want some gum ? You seem like you have a shred of common sense . What the hell are you doing here ? Somewhere on this island is the greatest predator that ever lived . The second greatest predator must take him down . You 're gonna use that ? If he doesn 't surrender , yes . - Let me see it for a second . - No . The animal exists on the planet for the first time in tens of millions of years and the only way you can express yourself is to kill it . Remember that chap about 20 years ago ? I forget his name . Climbed Everest without any oxygen . Came down nearly dead . When they asked him , " Why did you go up there to die ? " , he said , " I didn 't . I went up there to live . " Say , I haven 't had a chance to wish you luck on your new business venture . You 're off to a promising start . My team is intact , Doctor . I 'm sorry for the loss of your man . You know , it 's very easy to criticize someone who generates an idea , someone who assumes all the risk , - ... someone who puts everything onto the table . - If you try to sound like Hammond it just comes off like a hustle . I mean it 's not your fault . They say talent skips a generation . So ... Hey , I 'm sure your kids are gonna be sharp as tacks . Hammond 's reach exceeded his grasp . Mine does not . Taking dinosaurs off this island is the worst idea in the long , sad history of bad ideas . And I 'm gonna be there when you learn that . Take a break . Five minutes . - Are you injured ? - Huh ? Oh , no , it 's from the baby . I set its broken leg . It 's just not drying in the humidity . - Roland , a word ? - Uh-huh . I 'd love to know where we are . Making friends with Ahab , huh ? Hey , Carter , I 'm going to the ladies ' room . Wait for me here , okay ? It 's not polite to sneak up on people . Hey , Carter ! Where are you ? Hey , Carter ! I got turned around in here . Shit ! Hey , Carter , let me hear from you ! Hey , Carter ! Hey , Carter ! Carter ! Carter ! Hey , Roland ! Okay , break 's over . Moving on ! Carry me . Carter . Roland ! Roland ! Get off ! When did you last see him ? 10 , 15 minutes . Come with me . And you . If he 's alive , we 'll find him . The rest of you keep right on . 10 minutes , you should reach the ridge . Wait for us there . Miss Harding ... No one tells the little girl . Right . Let 's carry on . Everybody up . Come on . Up , up , up ! All right , guys , let 's get the hell out of here . Roland ? Did you find him ? Just the parts they didn 't like . Map . The operations building is right down in there about a mile and a half from the base of these cliffs . How do you know that ? I 've seen it . Now , the climb down won 't be easy . We 'll let them sleep one more hour . And then we hit it . Oh , no ! What is that ? Kelly . Stay down ! Stay down ! Stay down ! Don 't move ! Don 't move ! Don 't run ! Don 't look , just run ! Run , run , run , run ! Bastard ! You son of a bitch ! He can 't reach you ! Stay back ! He can 't reach us ! No ! Oh , my God ! A snake ! Help me ! A snake ! Stay back ! You 're okay . You 're okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's coming back ! Dad ! Thank you . Don 't go into the long grass ! Not into the long grass ! Hey , hey , hey , hey ! Look at this . What is this ? I think it 's Ajay 's bag . Go , as fast as you can . Go ! I see structures there . Okay . They said the communications center is in the operations building . So , I 'll just ... I 'll get in there and I 'll send the radio call , all right ? - I 'll see you there . - Wait for us . Every second counts . Anyone who thinks that can keep up , welcome to try . Okay , here we come . No ! Ian , rest . Oh , man ! Damn it ! Be there . Be there . CQ , CQ , this is ingen Operations Harvest Leader to Harvest Base . Repeating , I 'm calling for ingen Operations Harvest Leader seeking ingen Harvest Base . - Go ahead , Harvest Leader . - Thank God ! Yeah , the operation has suffered severe casualties . And the survivors are now in mortal danger . I need you to send rescue immediately . Our coordinates here are ... Our coordinates are 9 degrees 58 minutes north , 85 degrees ... Nick ! Nick ! Nick ! Nick Van Owen ! Nick ! Here ! Inside ! Anywhere ! Go inside ! Go , go . Where do I go when I 'm out ? I 'm right behind you . - Look out ! - Look out ! - Ian , watch out ! - Dad , look out ! - Up here ! - Up here ! Kelly ? Kelly , no ! Hey , you ! The school cut you from the team ? Get out of here ! Get out of here ! Go ! Come on , let 's go ! Come on , let 's go , let 's go , let 's go ! Let 's go , let 's go ! What about the other ? There must be more survivors . We 've got another chopper coming . It 's okay . It 's over now . That 's one souvenir they won 't be taking with them . Find the infant tyrannosaur . Roland can show you where the nest is . I want it on my jet . I 'll take it directly to the infirmary at the complex in San Diego . And hurry it up ! I 'd love to be airborne before the female knows we 're here . Oh , Roland ! Roland , Roland ! You probably saved ingen . We lost everything we came after on this trip . But this animal and its infant are gonna single-handedly bail us out . Congratulations . You 've got your trophy ! A buck only ! But it 's alive ! And everyone on the planet is going to line up to appreciate it and everything you 've done for us . What 's the matter ? He didn 't make it . Ajay . I 'm sorry . Really , I am . You know , I remember the people that helped me , Roland . There 's a job for you at the park in San Diego , if you want it . No , thank you . I believe I 've spent enough time in the company of death . Oh , my God ! 15 years ago , John Hammond had a dream . Like John himself , the dream was grand . It was outsized . It was bold . It was impractical . It was not to be . But half an hour from now , John Hammond 's dream , re-imagined , will come true . For one one-hundredth of the cost of building a destination resort thousands of miles away ... - Hiya , is this the Ludlow fair ? - I 'm sorry . - This a private property , sir . - No , we 're on the list , actually . You have to turn around , get back in your car ... No , no . This is Dr. Harding , I 'm Dr. Malcolm . We have Mr. Ludlow 's test results . Yes . There 's good and bad news . Tonight we 'll christen Jurassic Park , San Diego , with a mega-attraction that will drive turnstile numbers to rival any theme park in the world . I want to thank each one of you for being intrepid enough to turn up in the wee small hours of the morning . The ship , it 's here . It 's early ? You better come now . It 's so exciting ! - You see that lost-looking couple up there ? - Sir , you need to look at this . - Let them see this up close . - Yes , sir , Mr. Ludlow . Let me check . I want a direct line to the Coast Guard right now . Look , that 's their transponder signal , Venture 5888 . They 're headed in the port , but I can 't raise them . Try again . Skipper , SS Venture , this is ingen Harbor Master . Do you copy ? Over . Skipper , SS Venture , you are approaching the breakwater at flank speed . Reduce at once . Over . SS Venture , reduce your speed at once . - SS Venture , this is ingen Harbor Master . - SS Venture , reduce your speed at once . - You are entering a docking area . - You 're approaching a docking area . What 's everybody looking at ? We should 've stayed in the damn car . You okay , Mr. Ludlow ? I don 't know . How do I look ? Oh , my God ! Where is the crew ? All over the place . Check the cargo hold ! There may be crew down there . Everybody off the boat ! No , no ! Get away from that ! Now you 're John Hammond . Why the hell wasn 't it tranquilized ? It was . Roland hit it with two darts of concentrated Carfentanil . Over 10 milligrams . 10 milligrams sould 've put it in a coma . It stopped breathing . So , we gave it naltrexone to counteract the effects . But we didn 't know how much to give it . You administered an antagonist without knowing the proper dosage ? You 've put the animal in narcoleptic state . The thing 's a locomotive now . Look , we 're prepared here for this . Are there any more dinosaurs still on the boat ? No , we brought the infant back on the plane . Look , we had this to tranquilize it . Hey ! Do you have the infant ? It 's safe . Ian , the animal 's dehydrated . The first thing it 's gonna do , is go to a water source , and then it 's gonna look for the next thing its body needs . All the containment equipment is here . We 've got to get it back to the dock . The boat might still be seaworthy . All right , all right . Am I thinking what you 're about to say ? When we brought the baby to the trailer , it came . There 's no reason to think it won 't do the same thing here . Yep . Where 's the infant ? It 's in a secured facility . Why ? Where 's the facility ? There 's a dinosaur in our backyard . Benjamin , what are you doing ? What are you doing ? What ? - Come on . - What ? There 's a dinosaur in our backyard . - I 'm gonna tell you what it is . - No , you tell me . - You need to read to him . - You always tell me . No . No , no . - You need to read his fantasies . - Dear , I will tell you exactly what it is . You have to serve him dinner . - I served him dinner ! - He won 't be up all night . It 's the stupid fish tank ! - He needs a proper nightlight . - It 's not the fish tank . Put something over it ! Benjamin , please stop pushing me . - It may as well be daytime . - It isn 't . It isn 't ! Just turn it off . Slow down . Hey , slow down ! There it is . He 's sedated . Really heavily . Give me a hand . When the adult sees that it 's us once again with his baby , isn 't he gonna be like , " You ! " There may be some angry recognition . Who knows ? He may be just happy to see us . Hey ! What the hell do you think you 're you doing ? Taking the kid . If you really want to stop us , shoot us . How will we find the adult ? Follow the screams . Get to the other side of the bus ! - There , there , there . - Oh , my God ! It 's too drugged . He 'll never gonna know we have it , if the thing won 't makes some kind of sound ! Come on . Wake up . Come on . Come on . Wake up . He knows . Ian , Ian , slow down a little . I don 't think so . This guy 's almost fully awake . You know where you 're going ? Yeah , the waterfront 's right on the other side of these warehouses . Is there any way through ? Oh , God ! There could be . There we go . You have to follow me now . There we go . - Got him ? - Yep . Here we go . Ready ? Where 's the Rex ? Is it still behind us ? There 's the water . Shoot it . Shoot it . Tell them to shoot it . No , you idiot , the adult . Shoot the adult . I want the baby back alive . Dr. Malcolm ! What have you done with it ? I want that infant ! Are you there ? There you are . Wait . There 's a really first-rate shot of the deck of the ship and the cargo hold that , for the moment anyway , contains the animal itself , presumably with the infant alongside . Now , by our calculations , they should be nearing the halfway point of this trip . Jim , can you still hear me there ? Yes , I can , Bernard . We are in fact halfway to the island . It is 206 nautical miles from our present location . The ship is moving at about 20 knots , which will put it in at about 11 : 30 a.m. , Eastern time . One of the Navy 's primary concerns through all of this has been safety . And if we take another look around the ever-growing escort around the ship , they 're taking no chances of a repeat of the San Diego incident . Okay , we 're going to take a moment here and run the tape of our interview earlier today with John Hammond . He 's the former head of InGen Bio-Engineering , the man who has come forward to spearhead this movement not only to return these animals to their island , but to keep the island itself intact . It is absolutely imperative that we work with the Costa Rican Department of Biological Preserves to establish a set of rules for the preservation and isolation of that island . These creatures require our absence to survive , not our help . And if we could only step aside and trust in nature , life will find a way .

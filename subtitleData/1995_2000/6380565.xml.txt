 Dick ... Dick ... Dick . [ Yelping ] Dick , wake up ! Wake up , Dick ! Wha--ooh ! Wha--Wha ? Oh ! Oh , Sally ! Thank god ! I had the most horrible nightmare ! I dreamt that the big giant head came to earth ! And he was an obnoxious , loudmouthed boob , and ... and he made you high commander , and ... and then I was eating a giant marshmallow ... and ... oh , my god ! Where 's my pillow ? ! Dick . Get ahold of yourself , Ok ? Look . It wasn 't a dream . He did make me high commander . And my pillow ? He , uh ... he confiscated all our pillows for himself . Oh , my god . Then it 's true . Sally , get me some coffee . Dick ... [ Chuckles ] I 'm not getting you anything anymore . You work under me now , and you 're just gonna have to get used to it . Oh , great ! Now , get up and get dressed . No . That 's an order ! An order ? " High commander Sally . " That sounds real impressive . Rally ' round , troops . High commander Sally wants to go to the mall . Did it ever occur to you that I might actually deserve this promotion ? Of course it didn 't ! Uh , sir ... permission to- - Dick . What is this ? It--it 's called a soap opera , sir . Mmm . What are they doing ? They 're having sex . Sir , if--if I may- - I want to do that . I want to do what drake is doing to Amanda 's sister . Sir , I 'll- - I 'll call some people . But , sir , if I might , how could you make Sally the high commander ? I 'm the high commander . Well , not anymore . Then what am I ? I don 't know . How does " lieutenant " sound ? Awful ! That 's right . It doesn 't have much of a ring to it , does it ? Let 's see . Let 's make you the ... transmitter . " Transmitter Dick . " Now , that sounds kind of jazzy . But ... I--I can 't be transmitter . Harry 's the transmitter . Fine . Then you 'll be his assistant . But--but--but- - no . No . No . No . No . Don 't thank me . Wait . I 've changed my mind . Thank me . Ok , Tommy . Now , the thing about a cummerbund is that not only is it a nice accent to your ensemble , but you can also hide your stash in it . I 'm not hiding a stash in it . Oh . Well , you know , that 's a good idea . You ought to hold it . They never search the girl . That 's just great . I was worried about that , too . I 'm leaving . Ha ha ha ha ha ! She is the sweetest thing . You be good to her , Tommy . This is the most important night of her life . What about her wedding ? Ah ! Weddings come and go . But a girl only has one junior prom . Of course ... some girls have none . Hello , Vicki . Excuse me . Tommy , did you hear anything ? 'Cause I most certainly did not ! [ Sobbing loudly ] Ah . Good afternoon , Dick . High commander . Look , I ... I just want to say I ... I completely accept your new position and only hope that you will treat me with the same consideration and respect that I , as high commander , showed you . Of course . Get out of my chair . Sally , I need someone to drive me to get my corsage at 3 : 00 . No problem . Dick , drive him . Yes , sir . Thanks . Dick , get out of my chair . Uh , but- - move ! Dick , get out of my chair . Good afternoon . All : good afternoon , sir ! At ease , at ease . Well ... well . What 's going on ? We were just discussing Tommy 's prom tomorrow night , sir . Oh . What is this " prom " ? Uh , prom . It 's , um ... it 's a party . A party ! I 'm down . Count me in . That 'd be great , sir , but it 's only for teenagers . Well , he could go as your chaperone . Or he could not . Chaperone , chaperone . I kinda like the sound of that . Chaperone . Dick , get out of that chair . Yes , sir ! Right away , sir ! You , um ... want to sit down , sir ? No . Oh , it 's nothing to be ashamed of , Dick . This happens to all men at some point in their life . It does ? Sure . At least , I think so . I wouldn 't really know . I 've been batting kind of a thousand ... up until now . [ Groaning ] Oh , Dick , what 's wrong ? Ohhh ... I don 't know . Ever since stone got here- - oh , enough about stone ! I knew his type back in college . Big man on campus . But you look past that flashy smile , sleep with him a couple of times , do kinky things you never thought you 'd do , and then try for days to get him to answer the phone . Then you see the real him . This isn 't really the pep talk I was hoping for . Oh , Vicki , I love ya . Can you ever forgive me ? Aah ! I just came in to steal one of Vicki 's cigs . So what 's new ? Oh , you know . Same old same old . You wanted the cable hooked up in here ? Yeah . Right over there , honey . Hey . Oh , good . Stone . Look- - oh . If it isn 't crooked ear . Right . Uh , you know , I--I know you and Dick go back- - you have a very pretty mouth . It moves a lot , but it 's very pretty . Ok . You know , ever since you got here- - I--I can 't help but notice that you 're a woman . And as such , I 'd really like to have a go at the sex thing with you . So ... why don 't we find a pair of earmuffs and retire to the bedroom ? No , I--I don 't think so . Ah . Oh , my god . Oh , my god ! I know , and I 'm still just getting the hang of it . You pig ! No , no ! Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! The bedroom 's this way ! Oh , man ! This shirt doesn 't have any buttons ! What a ripoff ! Why don 't you try using some of these little black things ? Harry , that 's the stupidest thing I 've ever heard . Go get me a stapler . You know , you cannot order Harry around like that anymore , Dick . He outranks you now . Oh , right . I forgot . I have too much cellulite on my ass to be a high commander . Yeah , Dick . Maybe if you put on a wonder bra , you could get your job back . Are you guys insinuating that I got this job because of the way I look ? Who 's insinuating ? We 're saying it right to your face . Yeah . This is so typical ! When a woman with a body like this gets a promotion , everybody questions it . But if it were a man with a body like this , there wouldn 't be any question ! Ah . Sir . As per my duties as high commander , I have completed the daily status report . If you 'll notice , I 've organized it chronologically and not as my predecessor used to do , uh , in ... limerick form . Excellent work . Excellent work ! But you didn 't even look at it . Didn 't have to . I like what I 'm looking at right now . What are you saying ? I 'm saying ... vah-vah . Oh , my god . I didn 't want to believe it , but it 's true . You didn 't promote me on my merits . No , ma 'am . Oh , god . But don 't get me wrong . I promoted you because I thought you 'd be the best possible candidate to give me pleasure . Ok . I 'll give you pleasure , you steaming pile of alien- - that 's right ! Talk dirty ! Hey . I got a limo outside for Tommy Solomon . Yeah . Yeah , I 'm ready . Hold that thought . Shotgun ! You look really pretty tonight , Alissa . Thank you . Yah-ha ! Tommy , I just have a question . Yeah . Who is this man , and what 's he doing here ruining my life ? Yaaahhh ! Whoo-hoo ! Ha- - [ Choking ] I think I swallowed a bug . [ Romantic music plays ] Excuse me , sir . I would just love it if you wouldn 't play grab - ass with my typing teacher . I would love it if you 'd keep in mind which one of us is your supreme leader . Get--shh ! All right . Give her my love there ... big boy . Tommy . You 're spending more time with your dad 's friend than with me . Yeah . Well , you have to understand . It 's his first prom . Mine , too ! Right . Exactly . See that ? Hey , kids . Have you seen anything illegal goin ' down ? You know , smoking , drinking ? No . Oh . Come on , cats . Old Donny 's no square . I 'm totally down with your awesome scene . Now , uh ... which one of these kids is dancin ' with Lucy in the sky with diamonds ? Hey , guys . Hi , Vicki . What are you doin ' here ? Well , I was just sittin ' at home--hi- - I was just sittin ' at home feelin ' lonesome , and I thought , hey , what the hell ? It 's never too late to go to your junior prom . Ha ha ha ha ! I 'm not sure that 's true . [ Sobbing ] Dick . Hello , Mary . Is stone around ? No . Good . Because I have a little news flash about your friend . This afternoon , he grabbed me and kissed me ! What ? ! Oh , Dick , I know how this must make you feel . Oh , but this is wonderful ! What ? ! Stone likes you ! This reflects beautifully on me ! Dick , another man put his tongue in my mouth ! Tongue ! Yes ! How can this be a good thing ? Mary , don 't you see ? ! He 's given you his seal of approval ! Why do you care what he thinks ? The only thing that matters is what you and I think . Tell me , Mary ... what do you think ? I think you 're way too smart and handsome and sexy to waste a second of your time worrying about that braying jackass . Mary ... what ? ! I think my little problem is gone . Yehh-haww ! Tommy , your weird friend is ruining the prom . Which one ? He 's in the lead . So sorry , Alissa . I know I 'm screwin ' this whole night up for you , and you 're gonna probably end up back here in 20 years like Vicki . It 'll be all my fault . Tommy , it 's bad , but it 's not ... that bad . The point is that we 're here together , and that makes me happy . Really ? Really . Whoops ! I 'll get some napkins . [ Drumroll ] Ok , everybody , it 's that time ! And now the king and queen of the junior prom ... Tommy Solomon and Alissa Strudwick ! Ohh ! Ohh ! Oh , my god ! We won ! Ohh ! Oh , thank you so much ! Ohhh ... this is so beautiful ! [ Band plays ] ♪ Why do birds ♪ ♪ suddenly appear ♪ ♪ every time ♪ ♪ you are near ... ♪ oh , my god . It 's like he 's singin ' just for me . ♪ Close to you ♪ ♪ why do stars ♪ ♪ fall down from the sky ♪ ♪ every time ♪ ♪ you walk by ? ♪ Oh , dear , just like me ... they want to be ... ♪ close to you ♪ [ Whispering ] Oh , stone ... you know , this is how I always imagined my prom night would be . I--I was--I was in a bad , bad place , stone , but you 've ... you 've reawakened the woman in me . Let 's go to my place . No . Not the Solomons ' . No , no , no . My place . The view is ... [ Chuckles ] Unbelievable . Take me there . You know , for the first time in days , I actually feel good about myself . I don 't need a fancy title to have self-respect . I have love . You know , we got a little dried-up jelly by the stove here , Dick . On it . Let 's just get this settled once and for all . You know what ? Maybe my body got my foot in this door , but you guys know that I deserve this job regardless . Yeah , whatever . Tommy : sure . Shut up ! Hey , y 'all . Hey , Vicki . Hey , Vicki . That was some prom there . Oh , yeah , it was gr- - it was weird . Weird ? Well ... I was with stone ... ahh ! You were with- - stone ? Uh , what happened with stone ? Well , it just doesn 't make any sense . All I remember is I 'm lookin ' down on the earth from way high up , and there were these pulsating lights and this ... this noise , this ... skee-bee-Dee-beep-beep . Skee-Bee-Dee-beep-beep . Skee-bee-Dee-beep-beep . Skee-Bee-Dee-beep-beep . And ... stone was there , and that was nice . But the next thing I knew , I woke up in my own bed , and I don 't have a clue how I got there . Do you think I might be goin ' crazy ? Yes . Yes , you are going crazy . That is a shame . Yeah . My advice is forget about it , don 't tell anyone , and pretend you 're well . Yeah . Um , do y 'all have any deviled eggs , the kind with the relish in ' em ? I 've got this massive craving . You know what ? I think we have some of those in the living room . Let 's go , guys ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Oh , my god . He took her up to his bachelor pod . That skunk ! Takin ' advantage of my innocent little Vicki ? He is seriously out of control . All right . As high commander , I 'm gonna go in there , and I 'm gonna tell him what 's what . Good morning , sir . With all due respect ... you cannot just go around abducting humans . Yes , I can . Well , Ok . But , uh ... there are plenty of places on earth to do what you two did . I know . But I wanted to be really loud . You know , you four haven 't done this planet justice in your reports . It 's ... infectious ! I ... don 't want to leave ! In fact , I 've decided to make this place our new base of operation . You have ? Yes . I 've hired an architect . We 're gonna go up ... and out ! I 'm never leaving ! Vicki : stone ! I--I don 't- - I don 't understand this , but I ... I think I might be ... pregnant . Aah ! Well , look at the time . I gotta get going . Whoo ! Yes , indeed . I 've got to get going . Home for me ! I 'm late ! What are you doin ' ? ! I don 't know . I 'm suddenly overcome with a desire to flee . Sir ! Please ! Sir ! I hereby upgrade your evaluation to substandard . Keep up the good work . Uh , uh , proceed boldly and with stealth . Shwehhw ! Whatever . I don 't know . Ok . All right . We got a big situation here . But we got time . We got 9 months , so we can- - you guys ... we got a little problem here . Well , 10 minutes ago , these pants fit great . And now--now I can 't even zip ' em up . They- - they cost me $ 40 . Hello ! Mary ! Mary , it 's so good to see you ! Well , till tomorrow , then . Sleep well . I just got here ! Ohh ! Ohh ! Ohh ! Ohh ... ohh ... ohh ... oh . Oh . Wait . Yeah . Oh , my god , Vicki , look at you ! She 's put on a few pounds . Sally : yeah . You know , she loves her tacos , so ... you look like you 're 6 months pregnant ! Yeah ! Duh ! Where have you been ? I had no idea ! I mean , this is so- - Harry , congratulations ! Oh . Why , uh ... I do not need this my first week as high commander . I do not need this ! What 're we Donna do ? All right . All right . First things first . We minimize contact . Dick , you gotta get Mary outta here . Take her to one of those really long foreign films she pretends to like . Ok ? Tommy , call the hospital . Tell ' em there 's an incoming . Harry , you go run to the bathroom . I don 't want to have to stop on the way . Now , go ! Nice work , high commander . Thank you . For a beginner , I mean . Thanks . [ Chuckles ] Of course , there were no alien impregnations on my watch- - yeah , I get it , Dick . Um ... doc- - Dr. Albright ... it would mean a great deal to me if you would deliver my child into this world . What ? Well , you 're the only doctor I trust . Oh ... Vicki , I- - I 'm not that kind of doctor . Oh . I see . Just because I do not have insurance means I 'm not a human being . No . No . I--I can 't deliver your baby . But I 'll be there for you . Oh , well , now , that 's good , 'cause I believe my water just broke ! Dick , get in here ! We 've got to take Vicki to the hospital ! The baby 's coming ! [ Sally breathes nervously ] What are we gonna do ? What are we gonna do ? You 're the high commander . Give us an order ! Chase them ? Let 's go ! You 're gonna be Ok , honey . Oh , god , Harry , I can feel it ! I can feel it coming ! Just relax . Breathe deeply . You 're doing great . I can see the head . Boy , is that a big head ! [ All screaming ] is Dick in ? Haven 't seen him . Why ? Well , his friend stone left this at the prom last night . I think he was spiking ' the punch . What makes you think that ? Well , I , uh ... woke up on the football field when the sprinklers came on . Well , I 'll be sure to tell him when he- - uh--uh ... where 's my evidence ? I don 't know ! Jeez ! This happens to me all the time ! Guns , drugs ... I even lost a whole dead guy once .

 [ Rattling ] [ Screams ] [ Whimpers ] - [ Dog Whines ] - Come on , boy . [ Chattering ] Good boy . Search . Search , boy . Diagrams indicate this is the last unsearched pod . The survivors should thank their lucky stars these torsion barriers took the brunt . [ Whimpers ] It 's a damn miracle anything survived this hell . We got somethin ' . [ Mr. Parker ] Give me a hand , angel . - It 's good to see you out of the infirmary , Daddy . - Thanks . Ah . You look tired . I haven 't had a decent night 's sleep since the explosion . - [ Phone Rings ] - Ah . Yes . Oh . Yes . Keep me informed . Disposal team discovered a body in SL 27 last night . Sydney ? It 's too soon to tell . They need more pieces . Daddy , if - if the remains down there are Sydney 's , then - Forget Sydney . I didn 't put this bombing report together as a condemnation . Sydney planted the bomb ... but he acted out of a misdirected sense of guilt and compassion . Misdirected guilt and compassion killed your mother . I will not allow it to kill you ! What 's going on , Daddy ? Triumvirate is applying great pressure for a change in strategy . They 're not removing me from Jarod 's pursuit ? [ Chuckles ] Oh , no . I would never allow that . Ah , ' twas a bloody fight . Most important , none of it was yours or mine . Then what ? Well , they insist on adding a new player . Their selection is due in tomorrow . Is that necessary ? Desperate times . [ Click ] Centre Records lab . Surveillance feed came through this morning . [ Miss Parker ] Jarod . His body survived the blast . I 'm not so sure about his mind . [ Jarod Grunting ] [ Panting , Shouts ] - [ Jarod ] Kri kra toad 's foot . - [ Man ] Help ! Kri kra toad 's foot . Geese walk barefoot . - Hold him ! - Come on ! Kri kra toad 's foot . Geese walk barefoot . Kri kra toad 's foot . Geese walk barefoot . - Who the hell was that guy ? - I don 't think he knows . Let 's go . Where are my mom and dad ? [ Screams ] Where are my mom and dad ? [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Did you hear about the body ? - Was it Sydney ? - No . Thank God , no . It was that bleached-out Sweeper . That guy Gar . Hmm . There 's one less vacancy in hell . - Oh , man . It 's all too weird . - Tell me about it . - Haven 't seen that ghoul all week . - [ Broots ] Oh , no one has . - I hear he 's practically living over in Renewal Wing . - Renewal Wing ? That 's for head cases and invalids . Well , he is sort of both . What ? Do you think he 's up to something ? He 's always up to something . Sydney blew up his old playground . - I 'm gonna go see if he 's found a new one . - What ? In Renewal Wing ? - Have you gone crazy ? - Everyone has . [ Jarod ] Geese walk barefoot . Kri kra toad 's foot . Wagon from County brought him in . John Doe . No I.D. They found him lassoin 'Harleys over at the , uh , Dairy Queen . Kept insistin' he was a rodeo clown . Hardly a reason for a straitjacket . Hey . You 're the shrinks . All I know is it took six troopers to subdue him . - Thanks , Jimbo . We 'll manage from here . - All right then . Well , he definitely looks troubled , so let 's give him ... a comprehensive evaluation and determine what level security to put him at . Kri kra toad 's foot . Geese walk barefoot . Hi there . I 'm Dr. Goetz , and this is Dr. Blythe . Geese walk barefoot . - [ Goetz ] We 're both here to help you . - Kri kra toad 's - Where are my mom and dad ? - Why don 't we start with a name ? - Jarod . What 's your last name ? I don 't know . It changes every week . [ Man ] You know Mr. Raines is looking for you ? - [ Man # 2 ] He wants to see me now ? - Yeah . Come with me . Who 's there ? My God . Sydney . Miss Parker . - I thought you were - - Dead . Give them time . What the hell have they been doing to you down here ? [ Woman Screams ] I believe the term is " reeducation . " But I would plant the bomb again to save that child . Sydney , there 's nothing I can do to save you from this . I 'm not interested in saving myself . Jarod . Was he able to make it out safely ? In body , yes . Jarod flipped out ... pulled a psycho Martha Stewart at a Centre Records lab . [ Sydney ] That 's what I 've been afraid of all this time - that one day the pressure of living in the outside world ... and the truth about his past would come crashing down upon him . I need your help . I have to bring him in ... and I need to know exactly what I 'm up against . The anguish in his cry - It comes from deep within . [ Panting , Shouts ] Hmm . Oh , Sydney . You can 't see . Call it poetic justice . There must be something . Bring me anything Jarod left behind before he did this . They will never let me out of here . And there 's little time . This may be my last chance to helpJarod ... or you . [ Goetz ] Why don 't you tell me who you are and where you came from ? You wouldn 't believe me . Try me . I was stolen from my parents as a child , and I was raised by a place called the Centre . Think hell . With nicer furniture . Where exactly is this Centre ? It 's everywhere . Can I draw a picture ? I like to draw . Maybe later . Why don 't you tell me a little bit about this Centre ? No windows . No doors . No light . No hope . They take all that away . - They ? - The ones that decided ... what I ate , when I slept ... who I saw , when I talked . They decided everything I did . How did they do this to you ? They had eyes in every ceiling , every wall . They never blinked . They were always on me . Every minute , every hour ... every day of my life . Why 'd they do this to you ? To control me . I 'm a Pretender . I can become anyone I want to be . Except I don 't know who I am . I 've been a shrink before . It 's really very overrated . You don 't believe me . Only you know the truth . The truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth , so help me God . I was a lawyer once too . [ Man ] Never would have pegged him as a fake . [ Man ] Never would have pegged him as a fake . This Jarod you 're looking for was a janitor here . A damn good one . Very convincing . Always is . I don 't suppose you put together any kind of missing inventory list ? Uh , we 're just a records office really ... and none of the physical archives are missing . And has any data been compromised ? [ Broots ] Miss Parker . I found it . J - Jarod . [ Whispers ] Jarod tapped into the two ban six file . Major Charles . He was looking for his father in the Centre records . [ Broots ] Catherine Parker . He was looking for a connection between his father and your mother . This is everything he had in his locker . Hope it helps . Oh , my . Heavy-duty drugstore . [ Miss Parker ] Yeah . And the library for the shattered mind . You think whateverJarod found out about his father and your mother caused this ? - [ Gunshot ] - [ Screams ] [ Gunshot ] - [ Gunshot ] - [ Screams ] [ Jarod ] Miss Parker 's mother was murdered by the Centre ... and her father - [ Chuckles ] Mr. Duplicity himself - He runs the place . Then there 's Mr. Raines ... the Centre 's answer to Dr. Mengele ... an emphysema-riddled corpse who drags around his breath of life in a tank . Is there anyone else you want to tell me about ? The thumbless man . Mr. Lyle . He killed my brother . He killed me once too . And of course ... Sydney . - Who 's Sydney ? - Pavlov to my dog . Provider . Protector . Patriarch . He created me . You see , I 'm extremely valuable to the Centre . And while I search for who I am ... they search for me . [ Goetz ] He certainly believes it . [ Blythe ] That 's what scares me . I say keep him restrained ... and place him in a max security section . [ Goetz ] There 's a tormented boy inside , but I don 't think he 's dangerous . [ Blythe ] Carla , it took six policemen to subdue him last night . - Let 's not take any chances . - [ Goetz ] I want to work with him . [ Blythe ] You will have time . With his paranoid delusions and multiple personalities ... I doubt he 's ever gonna leave this place . [ Sydney ] Neuro-inhibitors , antidepressants , antipsychotics . - Self-medicating . - Not likeJarod . Well , the man who destroyed that room is not likeJarod . - Well - - Oh . " Shedding Light on the Schizophrenic Mind " ... . " Dementia . The Phantom Within , " " Dementia Praecox . " They 're all books on a - on a troubled mind . If we 'd only gotten to him sooner - I wish things were different too , Syd , but - but all the pieces to this crazy jigsaw fit . Hmm . [ Broots ] Not this one . [ Grunts ] [ Gasps ] It 's okay . My name is Jarod . I 'm sorry it took me so long to get here . [ Miss Parker ] I have a brother out there . [ Jarod ] I 've narrowed your brother 's identity down to these two files . One of these files belong to him ... and the other to a boy named Bobby . But you know him better as Mr. Lyle . I need a drink . A big one . Who killed my mother ? - Jarod 's father . - [ Gunshots ] [ Screams ] [ Angelo ] Miss Parker . Confused . Scared . Are you my brother ? Hope . - Maybe I 'm the crazy one . - [ Broots ] Miss Parker ! Miss Parker . Miss Parker . - [ Panting ] - You 're starting to sound like Dr. Fester . I 'm sorry , but I was tryin ' to find you all over this place . - Well ? - He 's here . - Who 's here ? - Him . I believe " him " is me . What the hell are you doing here , Lyle ? I 'm here to help you catch Jarod . It 's good to be home again . [ Jarod ] She looks very sad . [ Jimbo ] Mary ? Yeah , she is . She wasn 't so bad when she first came in here for nervous exhaustion ... but one night about two years ago , she broke out , tried to offherself . Gotten worse ever since . She should 've listened to her doctors . You should too . [ Lock Clicks ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] - Thank you for releasing me from my shackles . - You 're welcome . This is for you . For your drawings . You know , you 've told me an awful lot about where you came from ... and all the people that were there ... but the one thing that you haven 't told me about is Jarod . That 's because I don 't know who I am . [ Jarod ] Mary . Do you know who this is ? - Erica . - Yes . She had a pretty bracelet . You ran away with Erica that night . [ Mary ] Through the woods . Run . Erica , we have to get away . Erica ran through the woods , but she got away ? Erica 's gone . - Where is she ? - Erica 's wet . [ Gasps ] The water 's so cold . L - - Erica 's in the water . - [ Whimpers ] Can 't find her . I 'm coming , Erica . Hang on . Shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh . Mary . Mary . Mary , Mary , Mary . I want you to listen to me . Listen to me . Listen to me . I want you to stop taking your medication . It 's been making your mind sick when it 's really not . Someone has been trying to make you forget ... and it 's very , very important for you to remember . Okay ? Okay ? Shh , shh , shh , shh . ClearlyJarod 's crazy . Which , in my opinion , is the only explanation for his carelessness . The question is why ? Why has Jarod gone off the deep end ? - And how did he manage to - - Wait . Stop . Just how in the hell did you get back in here ? I believe the Triumvirate ... as well as your father ... see me as a man who 's willing to literally sacrifice his own flesh and blood ... - for what he believes in . - As opposed to ... kidnapping , embezzling murderer ? It 's all perspective . Some see a missing thumb . Others , four perfectly good fingers . I 'm having a hell of a time getting this thing to heal over . But like I said , sacrifice . You know they actually offered to transplant my big toe to re-create a new thumb ? Nobody re-creates quite like you , Bobby . Tell me , Parker . Exactly what are you willing to sacrifice ? [ Miss Parker ] Well , my mother sacrificed more than her thumb ... and I 'm willing to give just as much as she did . Ow . Sorry . [ Miss Parker ] It 'd be a shame to lose both of those . Why would Maryjump in the water ? She didn 'tjump to kill herself . She jumped because Erica was in the water . If I were you , Sydney , I would eat . I question how many more opportunities you 'll have to do so . [ Apple Crunches ] What more , Raines ? Who 's there ? A friend . - Ow . - Sorry . Florence Nightingale I 'm not . - Truth . - Yes , Angelo . I 'm searching for the truth . [ Door Opens ] Oh , oh . Oh , oh . I 'm not very good with blood , Miss Parker . What did you find out ? Who brought Mr. Lyle back ? Actually , it was your - your father . My father wanted Mr. Lyle ? Well , from what I could find out , he - he pulled strings from Europe to Asia to get him reinstated . What the hell are you doing with this ? Broots , I want you ... to D.N.A. Fingerprint these samples . Okay . It 's time I shook up the family tree , see who falls out . [ Keys Jingle ] Stay put , and stay out of trouble . Thank you for caring . Give it . [ Jarod ] Kleptomania is a hard habit to break . Mm-hmm . Fingers aren 't . [ Beeps ] [ Lock Clicks ] [ Goetz ] You 're hiding something . - Why do you say that ? - Oh , you 're a textbook case , Jarod . You did just the right things to get yourself in here . Not too much . Not too little . You didn 't hurt yourself or anyone else doing it . The question is why you want to be here . You 're the shrink . Well , it 's not uncommon for released prison inmates ... to commit offenses to return them to the security ... of an institutionalized environment . The Centre sounds like such an environment . I just don 't think that you want to go back there . No . Which brings us back to why you 're really here . To heal . [ Cell Phone Rings ] [ Cell Phone Rings ] - What ? - [ Jarod ] Did Sydney get his eyes back yet ? How the hell do you know about that ? Calm down , Miss Parker . Stress left unchecked creates madness . Well , then Hitler should have taken up yoga . How 'd you get out after the blast ? Well , if I told you that , Miss Parker , it wouldn 't be any fun . How did Daddy make out ? Better than yours will - when I find him . Misplaced aggression causes madness too . You cause madness , Jarod . Or should I call you Freud or Houdini this week ? Well , that is what makes me mad , Miss Parker . You see , I don 't know who I am . But , of course , you have the same reason now for sleepless nights . How does it feel ? Trying to define the branches of your family tree . The identity of my brother is my problem . It 's both our problems . Of course , the Parker family picnic will never be the same . [ Beeps ] [ Sydney ] I 'd know that Chanel anywhere . Sydney . What are you doing here ? We 're working . Together . As a team . Whoop-de-do . Just one big happy family , huh , Syd ? I 'm sorry . I must still have some ringing in my ears from that bomb blast . You remember the blast , don 't you , Syd ? [ Mr. Lyle ] Interesting about that . Upon further review , I realized you 'd reached the wrong conclusion . Sydney wouldn 't have planted that bomb . - It was Gar . - Gar . Gar couldn 't light a stick of dynamite if he had a road map to the fuse . - And why would he ? - Well , the truth ... unfortunately , goes to the grave with him . Tragedy . But a fortunate one for you , Syd ... that the Ken doll here corrected overnight ... the mistakes my report took a week to find . No . The fortunate thing is the powers that be agreed with my findings . Would that be the powers from Europe or from Asia ? The ones that count . Gee . Syd , I know you 're blind . L - I just didn 't realize deaf and dumb came with the package . You don 't understand , Parker . It 's crystal clear . You 've sold your soul to save your ass . I just hope you don 't get burned by the guy with the horns and the little red pitchfork . L-You know , I - I believe you 're confusing intelligence with guile . - We do have work to do . - Yes . " We . " There 's the operative word . [ Mr. Lyle ] Are you in on this pursuit or not ? Jarod contacted me earlier . He sounded different . Disturbed . I came here to research the Centre records ofhis psych profile ... try and understand his behavior . Great minds . Sydney and I were just exploring Jarod 's dive off the deep end as well . You think he 's really gone crazy ? Maybe he 's pretending to have lost his faculties ... so as not to stand out from others who have lost theirs . - [ Mr. Lyle ] Like in an asylum . - Hmm . Well , he 'd certainly fit in around here . I stopped taking them , like you said . Good girl . Mary , I found the car in the water . I found Erica . Mary ... do you think you could tell me about the night that you tried to escape ? Oh , I see things in my head . - I 'm not sure what to believe . - Trust yourself . Dr. Blythe doesn 't have control of your mind anymore . Well , Erica and I had become friends here . She was kind and funny . After a while , I - I could tell there was ... something bothering her . Then she told me . What did she tell you ? That she was going to have a baby . Dr. Blythe gave her the baby . He took advantage of her during her therapy sessions . Dr. Blythe wanted the baby to go away . She was scared . Confused . So I decided to ... help her escape . So you ran away through the woods ... - but something stopped you . - Oh ! [ Mary ] Headlights . Dr. Blythe . Yeah . He called out to her . - He - He said he wanted to talk to her about keeping the baby . - Come here . No ! I told her not to believe him . [ Jarod ] But she went to talk to him anyway . There was no talk . It all happened so fast . He hit her so hard she stopped moving . I can see he was panicked . I was frozen with fear . I didn 't know what to do . Erica in the water . You tried to save Erica ... but Dr. Blythe saw you . You surprised him because he thought that Erica tried to run away by herself . He held me under the water until the car came . - [ Jarod ] Car ? - [ Mary ] The orderly . [ Jarod ] Jimbo ? - So now he had a witness . - Dr. Blythe ! So he couldn 't kill you , so he - he dragged you out of the water ... and then he concocted this story about two escaped patients - one who got away and the other who was suicidal and incoherent . I 'm not crazy . No . Mary , you are not crazy . Dr. Blythe gave you this medication ... so you would think you were crazy so you couldn 't tell this story . But it 's time that someone told the truth . For Erica . And for you . [ Phone Rings ] - [ Jarod ] Dr. Blythe . - Yes . This is Trooper Raines , Maryland State Police . Sorry to get you up so early . I 'm a busy man . I get up early every day . What - How can I help you ? Well , it 's not what you can do for me . It 's more what I can do for you . Good news . We found your car . - My car ? - 1994 Mercedes . ZYP 959 . A couple of fishermen found it submerged out at Wilson Lake . Did they , uh , find anything ... in the car ? Well , it 's still too dark to be sure of anything ... except the fact that it is indeed your car . - It is funny though . - Funny ? Well , looks like it 's been down there for a couple of years , but ... you never missed a registration payment and you never reported it missing . - I guess you are a busy man . - [ Beeps ] [ Dial Tone ] Of all the psychiatric institutions in North America ... 20 have had John Does admitted in the last few days . - Anything ? - Well , we 're getting close . I 'm down to the last 10 here . [ Beeps , Twittering ] Pleasant Wood Psychiatric Institute , Towson , Maryland . It all seems way too easy . Believe it . Cuckoo Boy 's there . - But why would he leave us a trail right to him ? - Simple . It 's Jarod 's way of telling us he 's still in control . Bus is leaving . Save you a seat ? [ Ducks Quacking ] [ Jarod ] Erica 's not in there . I gave her the dignity that you wouldn 't . - What are you doing out of the asylum ? - Repaying a debt ... for two women . One whose life you stole ... the other whose mind you nearly destroyed . - You 're mad . - Well , it 's a mad , mad world . But don 't worry . You 're not going to be in it much longer . You 're no patient . - And you are no doctor . - Ow ! Just another coward running from the truth . Let go of me ! Let me out of here ! - Thought maybe you 'd like to go for a little ride in your car . - Please ? Erica didn 't get to plead for her life . Did she ? Or Mary , when you began feeding her hallucinogens to make her think she was crazy . You don 't understand ! I didn 't have any choice ! So please let me out of here ! Mmm . No . - Three victims . Three ruined lives . - No ! Don 't ! - One who died . - [ Screams ] One who has to live with that memory . [ Blythe ] Let me out ! And an unborn baby who never got a chance . Now I wouldn 't want all that on my mind when I met my Maker . - I 'd feel like - - Please , no ! Let me out ! - Like you do right now . - No ! Let me out ! [ Shouts ] [ Man ] You know , he 's lucky you came along when you did , Dr. Ratched ... or he 'd have drowned himself sure enough . - But , uh , we 'll take care of him . - No ! He 's suffering from classic paranoid schizophrenia . Delusional behavior and total self-destructive tendencies . I 'm ordering full-time restraints and complete isolation . You gotta help me . This guy tried to kill me . Sure he did , pal . We 'll make sure he doesn 't try to hurt himself again . No ! He 's not a doctor ! He 's a mental - - I 'm the doctor ! - We 'll be back to do an evaluation in , oh ... 72 hours . Don 't believe him ! I 'm the doctor ! I 'm the - l - I 'm not crazy . I am not crazy . Ow ! Doctor , tell me again . Where did you say you practiced ? Our primary clinic is in Delaware , which is whereJarod is maintained . Here we are . And there he went . Jimbo , notify the gate we have a possible escapee . Your family 's very excited about you coming home , Mary . You 're gonna be okay . - I know I am . - Come on . [ Miss Parker ] I 'm the one who missed Boy Wonder again . Why are you the one who looks like you swallowed a razor ? [ Chuckles ] Well , I - I might feel better if I had . Um , the genetic blood test results on your brother . [ Clears Throat ] - Conclusive ? - Oh - Oh , yeah . Tell me it 's Angelo . Well , I - I wish I could . [ Door Opens ] - This is Sydney . - How 's your sight ? My sight is gone for now . But my vision is in some ways clearer than ever . I see you 've found a way to survive again . As have you . - It 's a crazy world . - But you 're not . - You 're just lost , Jarod . - For now . But somewhere out there I 'll find my way . And I 'll find out who I am . [ Beeps ] Maybe I will too . - [ Man ] Hop in . - Thanks .

 Look it . The only living cell . So small that barely exists . Divide . Perfect replication . Modified to become what we want . For our sakes , I hope this work . They perfection , Rae . That takes time . For the Council no time . It is fascinating how different people Gua . Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes containing genes only 100,000 . Each gene is a small fragment of DNA which determines how people look , act , live and die . They are simple creatures . Biologically are simple , but complex in irrationality . - Good , complete sequence . - Initiate fertilization . Acceleration of human gestation . Vital signs are normal fetal . The fetus grows normally . Heart beat pectoral cavity . He joined the larval development in the state . Naturally it would take six weeks . We are almost complete definition . - Prepare to detach the bag . - Ready , Bern . Now . Nu s-a format . It seems that the basic sequence did not work . We need more evidence of human DNA . Sorry . In 1564 Nostradamus predicted the destruction of the world , 3 waves terrible . The first wave is here . My name is Cade Foster , and these are my stories . They killed my wife accused me of murder ... Now I 'm on the run , but not hide . Guided by the prophecies of Nostradamus , I 'm looking for , I hunt ... I will stop ... Translation and adaptation of the first wave Adyc / thin Catrenul 63 , IX century . " In a city reborn from the ashes , Bloody gladiators fighting for glory . " " Texture alchemy lethal human suffering , a patron of its own destruction " The city saw posters with " look " face on them was mine . This means that those who are close to me looking . And desperate times call for desperate measures . It 's time to get off the gloves . Below with a right hook ... That was before or after I broke to death ? You said we 'd be in Vegas so far . I do not even really knock a ring . You 're a fighter for 35 years . Have you been to prison , and a disqualification for drugs at the Olympics . Do not pay you to recite my resume . I want a chance . When World Boxing Association organizes a fight for the title , you know . No more struggling with these clowns . - It 's been a long time , Healy . - You must be joking ! What are you doing in Atlanta , man ? I thought you were fugitive Foster . Then I hear you 're on the list of fugitives that you killed your wife . I am innocent . Of course . So do I. It was a chance to be in that bank was robbed you . I have no idea how he got that gun in my hand . I came here because I need your help . Brother , can come back to prison , only for that talk to you . Tell you that if I need help , you 'll be there . Foster , it was in jail . People say a lot of things there . Look . " Searching for athletes and fighters . Human Genome Project needs your help . " I spent the last two years , following people who killed my wife . I have reason to believe are involved in this project . The Institute for Advanced Research in Atlanta . Explore human genes related to aggression . Fighting instincts . - Why do you need me ? - I want to get into the program . You 're the fighter . I 'm the coach . Once inside , we split up . - What 's the point ? - The thing that can be dangerous . - These people are criminals . - Look , Foster ... I know that you saved my skin when I was there . But promises have expired when I got out of prison ... I thought I had a chance with you . Glad to see you still knock them . Hei , Foster . The ? - Have good fighters out there ? - They say it 's the best looking . - I warm up your vocal cords . - Eddie , he is Omar Healy . Nice to meet you . Heard a lot about you . - Yes ? What have you heard ? - That you were in prison . About how you became friends ... We are soul mates . No friends . You said that there is a website about the group that killed your wife ? What is it about ? - Can we trust him ? - Yes . I do not know . It seems to me an asshole . He had a hard life , Eddie . It was on the brink of winning Olympic gold . He had a terrible headache just before a fight . He took some painkillers I was on the banned list and was disqualified . Life is so vile ... Then he took her astray . Drugs robbery attempt . It took four years in prison . Every prisoner had an alibi known . But this is the best . How do you expect anyone to believe this crap ? I 'm not stupid . - I believe . - Who ? Strange that you ? Yes , I 'm weird . And I 'm proud of it . Calm down . Why do you think the aliens are involved in the fight ... do all kinds of experiments , Healy . That 's the game . There are 30 genome projects at universities in the US All have a budget of $ 500,000 . Less than that , which has 4.5 million . Yes . So what ? Most of the money was donated by a company called " Oldam Industries " . It is a Cayman Islands subsidiary . We think it 's a cover - For money laundering . - All right , look , I do not care if Santa and his elves lead this project . I need good competitors . I 'm leaving this house crazy . Madhouse ? Well , almost ready . - He 's in great shape . - I train for two years . I turned gelatin rock . When I saw your ad , I thought it was perfect . There has to sign some papers and then give you the camera . - I wish I stay . - Want aggression , is not it ? I certainly motivates you break ends . It 's against the rules , but I think we can solve . Rooms with thick walls , the size of a shoebox . It reminds me of ? Do not worry . Imprisonment will be short . I need some time to take a look . - You know , Foster ? - What ? If you give me decent opponents , might sit a while . We are a team that aims to map the entire human genome ... ... We could cure diseases , perhaps even prolong life . - Battles that are part of research ? - Well , every university has a pair of basic genetics . We test 4586 . So you have isolated the gene that causes aggression ? Well , we 're still months away from the entire gene map . - But I think we 're pretty close . - If you ask me , aggression does not come from within , comes from outside . Certainly , environmental factors contribute . Therefore we can adjust Fighting laboratory temperature from freezing to extreme heat . Higher temperatures tend to increase aggressive behavior . That 's not what I meant . If someone treats you like dirt , you get angry . Yes , but imagine it might happen after we complete map 4586 . We could calm biological instinct violent criminals . Or you might intensify ... Enjoy now , boss . I 'll be next . - What 's the verdict ? - Our problem so far is combining human DNA without causing these deformities . His DNA could balance the previous sequence of base pairs . This sample is sufficient ? We 'll need to take more next time DNA , Rae . Our new fighter may be the answer . Sensors are on line . Monitoring cardio , check . Systolic checked . Diastola verified . ATB monitor , check ready and operational . How does it work ? We have sensors that measure heart rate fighters . - Voltage and other parameters . - For aggressiveness diagram ? Yes , but also make cellular and stroboscopic photographs . Bern , el este Jake Monroe , antrenorul lui Omara Healy . Jake , el este dl doctor Bern Galloway . Molecular biology , which I stole from Yale . The genius here . - I know . - I do not think . I 'm sure you 've seen , but I do not remember where . I just have one of those faces . But I can guarantee you that ... not quite smart enough to come to Yale . The atmosphere is stabilized . We are ready to begin . That 's all you got ? You are in trouble . Too fast , too bad , too good . Come on . Stand up ! Nobody beat Rudolph yet . - Healy e dur . - Haide . Let 's see how they react to temperature increase . Initiate climate change . Increase the temperature to 42 degrees . The real danger here is exhausting heat . Most fighters get tired quickly in these circumstances . The internal temperature of the body rises . Aggressive . Powerful . Ruthless . Enough of this , to come next . - Does courage . - That 's right . - Where is Monroe ? - I do not know . Maybe back in the room . How 's it going ? Did you find any alien ? In fact I think I found . It took the blood sample . Of course they took . This is a project about human genome . - I 'm talking about aliens . - Wait , Foster ! What 's the catch ? There 's no simple secret . Eddie waiting for us outside . Let 's go . Listen , maybe you saved my life but not my father . Look , I 've brought you here , I 'll get you out . I like it here . It 's the best training you can have . - Come with me . - Or what ? What to do ? I fight ? When I was in prison , told me how cold weather causing you headaches . - What led to your disqualification . - Yes ? - So you gave drugs alcohol . - Where are you going ? When I look at you now see another man , . What gives everything to become professional What does that have to do with aliens ? If you stay here , you die . I 've seen too often killing . And I do not wanna be the one who ruined your career . I do not believe in aliens . And I can take care of myself . Eddie ? Damn , Foster ! You can not sneak up behind someone , really . Yes . I actually can . I found something in a wing closed . - Something strange is happening there . - Like Gua , hide . You got plans ? - Yes , exactly from the database of the Institute . Okay , that 's it . The old labs McGruder , closed in ' 79 . There seems to be here a ventilation system . We may give access . - Ok , thanks . Any luck with ... - Mira Ruben ÅŸi Bern Galloway ? - Da . I-am verificat . I checked Mira Reuben to Daltanore schools in New York . Everything is checked . Birthday , dental records , passport , whatever you want . I think it 's human . - What about Bern ? - It 's interesting . I found all standard documents . Driving license , birth certificate , etc ... But ... But what ? - No data at Yale . Not graduated , not studied . All right . Good job , Eddie . - I thought you were coming with me . - Healy is stubborn . I 'm gonna check the old wing , then go take it . Then go with you . No way , Eddie . It 's already bad enough that there 's Healy . Foster , if I remember correctly , you failed the science of 8th grade . You can not distinguish the double helix spiral of hair . All right . Come on . This way . Come to think of it , the better you gave lessons . Hurry , my friend . - After you . - Thanks a lot . I think I solved the problem of ambiguity resolution . First dub in tandem , then sequentially . Massive Mutations are random . Is converted to alternative processes , primary code rewriting M-RNA . Genome sequence program , modify primary genetic markers X15D96347 . Really ? What we propose new warrior class will be two and a half times stronger , with greater resistance to biological dysfunction and sexual deviations . Create killing machines , Eddie . For the second wave . 49 beings ... I think Mr Healy base pair , will allow adequate gestation , and development without deformation . Initiating fertilization . Get ready for embryo transfer . Remember , there are basic motor neurological function , even without conscience . Can stand , walk , even blink . Be careful . - Oh , no , no freaks ! - And we are glad to see you . - I found what I do , Healy . - They took blood DNA from your sample . And use it to make a prototype of a warrior . Guys , I cause headaches . And it 's not even cold in here . First , little green men , after that Frankenstein ... - Decide once . - Healy , please . We have to go . What would happen if you and your friend have left ? I told you . - I can take care of myself . - You have to trust me . Eddie , sub pat . Listen , Healy , fight here most of my life battle . Give me one chance . So I 'm asking . - Monro ? Healy ? - Yes . What happened ? Did you see anything unusual ? Any unauthorized visit ? - I did not see anything . - What about you ? No , nothing . If anything strange happens here , what about the guards ? I 'm from the guard . Big deal . I need to rest . Leave me alone . - Foster , what now ? - Remain . And what do we do ? Bluff . - What 's your game ? Who are you ? - We have evidence that the genome project , infiltrated a particular group . They want to use your discoveries own purposes . You did not answer my question . Who are you ? I am the investigator of the Department of Defense . You got a card ? - I came here undercover . - Who is this group ? I can not talk about it now . I suggest you inform your superiors about this project , and let the police wing McGruder . E closed . Has not anyone used it . I tell you to call the authorities . Whatever you do , do not go there alone . I 'll call them , have a look . Guard , I need to get you in the control room . If you take one step scream . You must check the wing . You 're in danger . Be careful , please . - We need to get the hell out of here . - And how do we get security ? - Le distracting . - What about you ? - I 'll be back in the lab . - What the hell ? You must destroy the prototype , while I still can . I even talk seriously ! Oh no , it 's just a joke made by your friends from prison because you 're a gang . Come on , man ! If you stay here , you might not get out . I take the risk . As I have said . I I got here , I 'll get you out . - Foster . - Let 's go ! When the opportunity arises , you slay . That yes , gratitude . After completion of the test X 15 , announce the success of the Council ... To distinguish between the new body and the usual ... Look ... What happens ? - I can explain ! - Can you ? Yes , I did a little research ... Did you expect as an experiment so important to be monitored ? - You Gua ? - Are Supervisor . - But I thought you ... - Man . That was the purpose . Bern , maybe it was a genius empirically , but allowed anyone laboratory to discover why he had to die . That someone was Cade Foster , known as Topic 117 . Bern believed he recognized the face . Come in . Wait diversion and then get the hell out of here . - Take the gun with you . - You know I can not stand ... No time . Get in there . - Wait ! - Run ! Hey , it 's okay . - Okay ! - Damn ! Come on , Healy . Healy , must go . Hi , 117 . I understand what you are best humanity has to offer . Prepare to face what we best offer . I can not believe . But I saw what I saw . That guy just melted . As I said , Healy . Aliens . - With that we face . - What am I doing here ? We mix DNA with alien DNA . Try to build a prototype warrior . No one is invincible . Everyone has a weakness . - Network . - Network ? Salt affect them , such as a drug . I salt , man . I have everything . Salt pills . I have to think how to use them in the ring . Do not enter the ring . You heard Mira . I am against the prototype . No , I am against it . - No way . - You can not fight me . I agree , but that does not mean that a fight you . Foster , this is my chance , do not you see ? It 's better than a fight for the title . I will fight with the best . Are you crazy ! Eddie goes for help . If you can steal that thing ... - We have a chance to get out of here . - Okay . I told you I 'll kick your ass . Wake him . - No chance . I 'm sick of his crap . Then you will be the first man who will fight with X15 . Bring it here ! Initiate the transfer . The transfer begins . Downloading memory ... The transfer was completed . E perfect . - Foster ? - Eddie ? - Here . - What are you doing there ? - Where is the diversion ? - We have not even had the chance . - Healy will fight prototype . - What do we do ? You have to help Healy . Do you have a gun ? - Eddie ? - I escaped . - What did you do ? - Is very narrow here . - You can exit the ventilation system ? - I think yes . It 's a control room ringside . Find it ! I understand . I 'll be there . No problem . - Are you ready ? - You come to talk , or to fight ? You have to do more than that . This is not the time , when thrown in the towel ? Let 's fuck . Oh , nu ! 117 . Prepare to die . Da ! L-ai prins ! The salt does not affect our hosts . I corrected that flaw at the molecular level . - There 's always a weakness . - Not to me . You will kill Healy ! Watch out ! This host has your DNA , Healy . I beat you with your own strength . Cold , Eddie ! Do cold ! Frig . Come on , Eddie . It will be slow and painful . Come on ! Come on , Eddie ! Foster , bypasses ! Come on , man , get out of there . - I beat ? - You won , Healy . The ? You were great . It 's okay . Come on , Foster . We have to go . It was a great loss . Many resources and time allocated for anything . Bern and Mira are dead . Host X15 was destroyed . We will take years to restore Bern 's brilliant research . If we ever succeed . But this experiment was not a total failure . DNA 117 . We Cade Foster subject . How did you know to do cold ? Healy said something . Everyone has a weakness . Since X15 was partially created in Healy , I thought he 's inherited genetic weakness . Yes , migraines . Not bad for someone who has failed to science . I asked Healy to join me in the fight against Gua , and although I warned him of danger , I can not feel guilty of his death . Like General , who by his orders , he condemns some people to death , am I responsible for the lives of those who join me in battle ? I think yes . But at the same time wonder at the sacrifice of Healy and I am grateful that inspired us most battle . For this reason , will always be a champion . Translation and adaptation thin AdyC

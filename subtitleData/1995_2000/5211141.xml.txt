 Where 's Colin ? He 's looking to perfect his technique . Oh ! I 'm sorry . Sorry . I didn 't see you . Because you weren 't looking where you were going . I told you , you gotta open your eyes when you 're sliding through the vortex ! Look , I 've been a horse and buggy man most of my life . Warp speed 's a new concept for me . Yeah . Well , you 'll get hip to it . I just hope I survive your learning curve . Okay , you guys ! Where are we ? The Garden of Eden ? Listen . Oh ! Wow ! It 's beautiful ! Please tell me we 're here for at least a week . Sorry . Just a day . Waterfall 's making me thirsty . You think it 's safe to drink ? I don 't know . Was there dysentery in the Garden of Eden ? There 's one way to find out . Whoa ! Looks like somebody nuked him . Yeah . They cut off his right hand , too . Cover . Come on . Cover . Cover . You still want to stay here a week ? What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds where it 's the same year and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? I tracked this one . He was my kill . He was . But you didn 't get a shot off . Because you didn 't give me a chance to . And you already had one kill today . Are you pouting , Kryoptus ? How terribly human of you . I was speaking the truth . I didn 't know that was considered human . The truth is I fired the shot . This kill is mine . Those are the rules . You think I don 't know the rules ? If I don 't take a human soon , General Kronus will banish me . You 'll get your kills . But I get this one 's numbers . Take the eyes . No . General Kronus ' orders . It 's my kill . I haven 't developed a taste for them . How terribly human of you . If this is the Garden of Eden , we just found the serpent , the Kromaggs . Are you sure ? They look different than the ones we 've run into before . Colin 's right . They look , I don 't know , softer , somehow . Almost human . Doesn 't matter what they look like . I spent three months in their freaking jail , so I can smell them . Oh , my God ! Check it out . Must be some kind of ID . He 's been branded like cattle . Hey , guys . Look at all this stuff . A compass , a tin of black , greasy stuff . And this strange knife . Yeah . This is night camouflage . Oh , this is truly inspired . Look at all this stuff . A knife blade , a saw , a screwdriver . What 's this ? You 'll never use it . Well , what 's with all the tack gear , huh ? Think we slid into another war zone ? Maybe some kind of war game . A game ? Where the score is kept with dead bodies . Or human hands . Well . I 'm not gonna be a trophy on somebody 's wall . I say we keep moving . Yeah . There 're bound to be a lot of other Maggs hanging around in the woodworks . Come on . Let 's go . Keep your eyes peeled . Human targets . I wouldn 't expect any less of the Maggs . No shell casings . They must use strictly energy weapons . Shh . Vehicle . Up there . Sir . I heard Kyra made one confirmed kill today , sir . Possibly a second . She 's learning to fetch faster than the dogs . Yes , sir . Two more and she qualifies for elite warrior status . I can count . It 's a shame that a Dynasty general must dirty his hands with these Humagg mongrels . All great civilizations used slaves , Corporal . I think we just got a look at the top brass . I say we take them out now and save ourselves a headache later . Let 's not rush into anything . We slide in 18 hours maybe we should just sort of hide until then . No . Remmy 's got a point . I 'm not saying we go in swinging . But we should find out what the Maggs are doing here and ... I got her . What ? Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! All right . We need some info . Who are you ? Who are you ? The people who just took your weapon . So drop the attitude . Okay . Okay . Okay . The name 's Jenny Anderson . I 'm Quinn . That 's my brother Colin . That 's Maggie . That 's Rembrandt . You must be newbies . Where are your tattoos ? We don 't have tattoos . All the humans have tats . Where did you come from ? We kind of lost our way and stumbled into this place . Yeah . Well , my advice is to stumble back out . This is a limited stay kind of resort . Limited by those knuckle draggers with the laser guns . Kromaggs . Whatever . All I know is they shoot first and they never ask questions . How did you get here ? I was asleep in bed one night and this bright light shined in through my window . Next thing I know , I was being dragged out in this crazy spaceship . I figured I 'd get probed and I 'd wind up on the " Jerry Springer Show . " But instead , it 's alien safari time and I 'm the endangered species . So they 're hunting you ? Me and six other freaked-out people . They slapped tattoos on our arms , gave us each a piece and cut us loose . If we can survive 20 days , then we can go home . I 'm on day 18 . Did you know a guy with a blonde buzz cut , about six feet ? Sure . It 's Jake . Insurance guy from Michigan . You seen him ? He 's dead ? I 'm afraid so . That takes us down to six . Where are the others ? Hiding out in some bombed-out building . They 'll be stoked to see reinforcements . So , are we friends or are we enemies ? Come on . Man , this place has gone to hell . Hey ! Deadbeats ! Come on out ! We got company . So where are they ? Say hello to the troops . Sorry , but those aliens can make themselves look like us . And we already lost two people to ambushes . Where 's Jake ? Dead . These guys saw the uglies waste him . Damn it . How do you know they didn 't do it ? Relax . We 're all human . We want to help you people . But we don 't have a lot of time . Help us how ? Look , we 've had some experience with the creeps . Okay ? Together we can work out a plan of attack . Plan of attack ? We 're not gonna attack anything . We 're just looking to survive . To survive , you have to go on the offensive . You don 't get it . I 'm short , man . Midnight tonight , I 've got my 20 days in and I 'm out of here . No , no , no . You don 't get it . Think the Maggs are just gonna let you go home ? Say , " Hey , good job . You beat us fair and square . See you . " You don 't go after them , man , they 're gonna come after you . That 's 100 % guaranteed . I know the general direction of where they camp out . Oh , this is crazy . Let 's do it . You 're leading the board . Am I ? By two kills . But you know that . Has your Kromagg side developed to the point where you can read my mind now ? No . Just your face . You haven 't stopped smiling all day . Don 't you like it when I smile ? If it 's for the right reason . Look at that . You 're smiling now . Attention ! I understand that you had a productive day . Yes , sir . Two more solo kills and you qualify as an elite warrior . Does that please you ? My only pleasure is to serve the Dynasty , sir . For 10 generations , the Elites have been the pride of the Dynasty . It sickens me to think that their ranks are sullied by your human blood . Human blood is only good for spilling , sir . Uh-huh . And as for you , perhaps you would perform better with a number on your arm . Maybe it would give you more incentive ? As you wish , sir . Was there anything left over from your last kill , private ? No . They were both head shots , sir . Pity . Perhaps next time you could aim lower . Dismissed . General . A moment ? What is it ? Fresh human eyes . So , you do have some value , after all . Where did these come from ? Kyra 's last kill . I would hate to think she was serving a Kromagg Dynasty general with anything less than total honesty . That 's for you to evaluate , sir . This whole area is lousy with those creeps . We figured their HQ must be close by . So you know who these aliens are ? They 're called Kromaggs and they are not aliens . Could 've fooled me . Well , they 're actually from Earth . Just a different Earth than this one . Right . So , what do they want with us ? Well , that 's the question . The ones who killed your friend looked different from any Kromaggs we 've seen before . Maybe they 're testing some kind of new warrior . Look out ! Go ! Go ! Make a run for it ! Split up ! Don 't shoot ! I 'm not part of the game . Kill him . Look ! He 's not marked . Where did you come from ? We 'll find out soon enough . Stamina is just incredible . This is really bad coffee or pretty good soup . You are such a wiseass ! Hey ? What 's the matter ? Where 's Colin ? They took him away . They captured him . Where 's Jen ? She tried to lead the Maggs away from us . And they executed her . She told you to just lay low ! Hey ! You think I like this ? Huh ? Two more days and she was out of here . I 'm telling you . The Maggs are not letting anybody out of here alive ! Now , I say we get our weapons and we go get our man . That 's just what they want you to do . The first week I was here , they caught this surfer kid from San Diego , Tim . They shot him in the leg and they nailed him to a billboard . After eight hours of screaming , someone tried to get him . The uglies had a twofer that day . I 'm sorry about your friend . We 'll give you some weapons if you want to go after him , but don 't expect any help from us . How did you get here ? I was brought here . Abducted from my home by you people . We keep close track of our inventory here . We have no record of your arrival . Where do you come from ? What is this ? It 's just a timepiece . Why is it ticking down ? Our technical staff will take this apart and find out what it is . Then perhaps they will do the same to you . What are you looking at ? Nothing , sir . Fascinating to see one in captivity , isn 't it ? Go on . Take a closer look . He 's even uglier than you , isn 't he ? Yes , sir . You still owe me a token from your last kill . Would you like to kill this human ? Present his eyes to me ? As you wish , sir . Eyes are so much better when eaten fresh . Corneas nice and tender . Pupils still dilating . He is afraid . Can 't you sense it ? Yes , but strange . It 's not fear for himself . There are others . Very good . Your mental training is proceeding nicely . Perhaps there are other things we can learn from this human . We will save his eyes for later . I will have everything I need soon enough . Whether you wish to share it with me or not , the human mind is so frail , So effortlessly opened . They grabbed him over here . Colin 's ? Yeah . And they headed this way . We have recently discovered an undocumented human in the field . No tattoo . No record of being deposited here . It 's possible that he is an infiltrator , and there may be more . Anyone who captures a live unmarked human will be rewarded with two kills . Some of us could use the practice . Do you enjoy watching people struggle ? When I see a human , they usually do not struggle for long . Human behavior is inexplicable . Even if you get those restraints off , you will still be imprisoned by the force barrier . My mother always told me hope springs eternal . Your mother ? Yes . Explain to me . Who is mother ? You don 't know who your mother is ? My interaction with humans is limited . Limited to killing them ? I asked you a question , human . Maybe you have a different word for it . Your mother is the woman who gave birth to you , who raised you . I was born in a breeding colony . I was raised to serve the Dynasty . A breeding colony ? Yes . You 're half-human . I was bred from a human female . Yes . Your mother . The human female was simply used as a vessel for my incubation . An unfortunate necessity . That 's barbaric . More barbaric than the vicious weapon you humans used to drive us from our world ? What are you talking about ? The residual effects left Kromagg women genetically mutated . Two days after giving birth , a Kromagg woman dies . A death sentence for our species . The Dynasty had no other choice but to crossbreed . You created us . Not the Kromaggs . I 've been looking for you . Why is the force barrier down ? I was interrogating the prisoner . Why ? To hunt the human animal , it may help us to know him . He is fascinating in his way . The General has ordered us back in the field . When you 're finished with your new plaything , perhaps you will find the time to return to your duty . Kryoptus ! Stop ! What ? I have weapons inspection in 10 minutes . Are you jealous that I was talking to the human ? What ? Jealousy . It 's when you fear a rival , or when you 're suspicious of someone 's fidelity . It happens to humans . Especially when they ... When they care for someone . You say that as if it should have some meaning to me . It might . To your human side . We all wear the stigma of our humanity on our faces . It is a shame that I strive to overcome . Make no mistake , it is our Kromagg blood that makes us who we are . Warriors . Why do you think we hunt the humans ? So we will never forget what they are . Prey . Non-conductive . The blood trail ends here . I guess he stopped bleeding . Talk about your good news , bad news . So which way now ? If the Kromaggs have their base hidden , we could walk right past it and never see it . We could be looking for days . We don 't have days . No kidding . Yeah , well , I bet one of those guys know . I say we grab one of them . Easier said than done . Take the left . Those Maggs are trained in guerrilla warfare . If they 're trained to hunt humans , let 's give them one to hunt . Hey ! Come out , human , and you won 't be harmed . Hands on your head . I was just about to say the same thing to you . Drop it . Come on , Magg . Make my day . Kill me and be done with it . That 's not really our style . Then I 'll do it myself . Cuff her ! All right . Come on . Back ! Let 's get out of here . Kryoptus ! Kyra ! Go ! I 'll follow you . Go ! Go . Remmy ! Hey . You okay ? I don 't know . I just feel like I 'm out of gas . It 's all right , Rem . Just lie down here . All right . Lie down , Remmy , and rest . How you feeling ? I 'm cool , man . I just gotta catch my breath . I feel like I 've been kicked in the stomach by a horse . Okay . You sit back , Rem . We 'll take care of you . What 's the composition of the laser ? Tell me or you lose a knee ! You won 't . Try me ! It 's not a laser . It emits a focused beam of high-energy particles . What generates the particle stream ? A magnetically-shielded nobelium core . Quinn . What 's that ? Nobelium , it 's a ... It 's ... It 's highly radioactive . It 's like he got shot with a poison arrow . If the blast doesn 't kill him , radiation poisoning surely will . Where are your friends ? What friends ? They captured Kyra . Tell me their location or I will kill you ! This is really an ingenious little tool ! When I get out of here , I will use it to gut you . Sorry about this . I 'm sure Kyra is all right . My friends would never hurt her . You care for her , don 't you ? I serve the Kromagg Dynasty . Nothing else is of value to me . I don 't believe that . I hope you 're able to tell her how you feel . It would be a shame if she never knew . Band-Aids and Bactine . I can 't use any of this . I could probably make a field dressing out of this gauze . And then what ? That laser blast is poisoning him . If we can keep him stable , maybe the next slide will take us someplace where we can get him help . How much time ? Three hours . And we don 't even know where Colin is . She does . Maybe you haven 't noticed , but she doesn 't seem to like you . There 's clearly a human quality to her . All we have to do is appeal to it . Is that that human quality she showed when she was trying to claw your eyes out ? Give me a half an hour with her . I 'll get the information for you . You gotta look closer . In her eyes . She 's trying to act tough , but she 's really scared . Good . She 's alone and afraid . If we can get her to trust us , maybe we can convince her to contact her base . Have a swap between her and Colin . Yeah . When you 're through jerking around , give me a call . At least let me kill her . What do you think that guy did on his world ? IRS auditor ? He 's right about one thing . Getting that Kromagg to help us is a long shot . Maggie . It 's our only shot . I 'll do this . Are you a traitor ? No , sir . I almost hoped that you had betrayed me . The only alternative is that you must be stupid beyond belief ! I have failed you , my General . My life is yours . And don 't think that I won 't take it . However , I have decided to give you one last chance to redeem yourself . Find the human and his companions . Bring them to me and your entry into the Elites will be assured . Yes , sir . Don 't come back alone . All right . You are free . And you get water . Now , you get up and stretch your legs out . What happened ? You injure your ankle ? Let me see . Yeah . It is definitely swollen . What is it about you that desires to see me healed ? Call it a frailty of humanity . And I aim to please . Why ? What weakness compels you to aid others ? We consider it a strength . You should try it sometime . It is not in our nature . I 'm not so sure about that . Sorry . I was curious . You 're different than the others . You 're more like us . And you definitely have a strong grip . I am half-human . A product of the colonies . " Colonies " ? Is your mother being held captive in a Kromagg breeding camp ? Mother . The other human , the one like you , mentioned his mother . Like me ? My brother ? Colin ? Brother ? You were both bred from the same woman ? Yeah . Well , not exactly bred . We 're family . Family ? He wants to kill me . He probably thinks the feeling is mutual . He is human . So am I. And I don 't want to kill you . Nice . Airline food in a tube . I thought you said you didn 't want to kill me . Not intentionally . Didn 't you ever want to find your family ? Know who your mother is ? The Dynasty forbids such inquiries . Interest in our human heritage is not encouraged . I 'm looking for a breeding colony myself . I think a friend of mine might 've been shipped there . Her name is Wade Wells . How could you possibly get to a breeding colony ? The same way I got here . Sliding . Sliding ? Translocation technology is forbidden to humans . Punishment is death . I know . Why would you tell me this ? Because you can help me . For that , I 'm willing to take a chance , extend myself . It 's how we humans build trust . I can 't help you . Yes , you can . You 've seen my brother . You know where he 's being held . You expose yourself for another being ? Sure . Especially if that being is a member of my family . See , it 's something Kromaggs don 't understand . But I 'm hoping the human side of you does . Quick ! Quinn ! Hurry ! Hang on , Remmy . It 's okay . I can ... I can make it to the stage . I can make it ! Don 't talk . Don 't talk . Try and sleep . That 's no problem . That 's no problem . I just need the ... Quinn , he 's burning up ! Please , Kyra . You 've gotta help us . Hang on , buddy . Remmy ? Remmy . Stay with me here . Remmy ! Remmy ? Remmy ! Remmy , stay with me ! Remmy ! Remmy ! Remmy . Stay with me , man ! You can 't die on me ! Remmy ! Remmy ! Remmy ! MAGGIE . Remmy Remmy ! Remmy , stay with me ! Please , Remmy ! Please , Remmy ! Remmy ! Remmy ! Remmy ! Remmy , stay with me ! Remmy ! Remmy , please ! Remmy ! Remmy . Stay with me , Remmy ! Remmy . Stay with me ! It 's not your time . Remmy ! Remmy . Remmy . Remmy . Remmy . Remmy . Thank God . Q - Ball . I saw the white light . It was calling me , calling me home . I heard your voice . You brought me back . You brought yourself back , Remmy . It wasn 't your time . Quinn . I 'm so dry . I need something to drink . You know the Kromagg healing technique . Yes . You wanted me to feel my human side . But I am Kromagg , too . Well , it does have its advantages . Why did you save me ? Because you needed my help . How does it feel ? It felt fine . Thank you . Can you do something about this ? Colin ! Oh , Colin ! Thank God ! How did you escape ? I used that trick I saw on that " Penn Teller " special on the last world . Hello , again . Colin . Hello . Is she supposed to be here ? Quinn and Maggie snatched her to try to get her to take us to you . She 's part of the team now . Fifteen minutes . Why don 't you come with us ? There 's someone here . I have to show him what you 've shown me . That we cannot deny half of who we are . Do you think he 'll understand ? I don 't know . But I have to try . In a way , he is my family . I desire to touch you . Whoa , whoa , whoa . We don 't just touch anyone . But I see in your eyes that you will allow it . The eyes never lie . Goodbye . Kyra ! Waste him ! Get up ! Get away from her , human . Kryoptus . Kyra , step over to me . I 'll share these kills with you . We 'll join the Elites together . No . I said come to me ! No ! I don 't care about the Elites . I won 't kill these humans . As you wish , Kyra . I 'll take these kills for myself . How much time ? Three more minutes . All right . We 'll keep our heads down till then . It 's gonna be a long three minutes . Down ! Down ! Move out ! Move out ! Down ! Jammed ! Kyra , come with me ! We will clear your mind of the human poison . Two minutes ! All right , let 's go . When do you plan to shoot , girl , tomorrow ? I 'm out of ammo . Stand aside , Kyra . No . Don 't make me kill you . Listen to me . We don 't have to be killers . It is what they 've made us , not who we are . These humans have twisted your mind . They 've opened it . We 're not just Kromagg . We 're human , too . There 's a whole new world I 've just begun to discover filled with human emotion . Human emotions are a sickness ! You 're wrong . They 're part of us . To deny their existence is to deny who we are . I can 't kill who I am . Who you are ? Look at me , Kyra . Look at my face . This is who we are . We are Kromagg . If I could cut the human part from my body like a tumor , I would . Just because it 's a part of us doesn 't mean we have to embrace it . What 's happened to you ? What 's happened to you , Kryoptus ? It 's time . Nobody move ! I will kill you all ! No , you won 't . You won 't kill me . You have feelings for me . I can feel them . Go ! Quinn , let 's go ! Go ! You 're right , Kyra . I can 't deny who I am . Kryoptus ? The humans killed her ? No , I did . The humans had turned her . She was helping them escape . I had no choice . And the humans ? Three dead inside . Six more escaped . Mmm-hmm . Three kills . Well done . You surprise me . Welcome to the Elites . Thank you , sir . Move out ! There are humans in the area ! Dispose of this . Yes , sir .

 In the late 20th century , hostile forces inside the United States grow strong . The city of Los Angeles is ravaged by crime and immorality . To protect and defend its citizens , the United States Police Force is formed . A presidential candidate predicts a millennium earthquake will destroy L.A. in divine retribution . Like the mighty fist of God , Armageddon will descend upon the city of Los Angeles , the city of sin , the city of Gomorrah , the city of Sodom , and waters will arise and separate this sinful , sinful city from our country . An earthquake measuring 9.6 on the Richter scale hits at 12 : 59 p.m. , August 23 , in the year 2000 . After the devastation , the Constitution is amended and the newly elected president accepts a lifetime term of office . The country 's capital is relocated from Washington , D.C. , to the President 's hometown of Lynchburg , Virginia . Los Angeles Island is declared no longer part of the United States and becomes the deportation point for all people found undesirable or unfit to live in the new , moral America . The United States Police Force , like an army , is encamped along the shoreline , making any escape from L.A. impossible . From the southeastern hills of Orange County to the northwestern shore of Malibu , the great wall excludes L.A. from the mainland . The President 's first act as permanent Commander-in-Chief is Directive 17 . Once an American loses his or her citizenship , they are deported to this island of the damned , and they never come back . Attention . We are on tactical alert . Remain at battle stations . I repeat , remain at battle stations . This is the Police Channel and this is prime news . In a late-breaking story , the force has announced the arrival of the most notorious outlaw in United States history at Firebase 7 , the Deportation Center for Los Angeles Island . Now this on-the-scene report . War hero . Criminal . The force 's most wanted man . Convicted of 27 moral crimes . Arrested two weeks ago on a charge of gun fighting for profit in New Vegas , Thailand , U.S. Territory . It 's been 16 years since his famous rescue in New York , and the reports of Plissken sightings have remained constant during that time . Commander ? We 're still getting a trace from the rescue team , sir . - Stationary signal ? - lt has not moved from this location . That means he 's hiding , captured or dead . - So we go with Plissken ? - He 's all we 've got . Hello , Plissken . Welcome to L.A. Come on . Move it . - That 's Snake Plissken ? - What did you expect ? I don 't know . He just looks so retro . Kind of 20th century . Good old days . Let 's get going . The people of the United States have waited a long time - for this criminal . - Move out ! You are now entering the Deportation Center . You have been found guilty of moral crimes against the United States of America and sentenced to permanent expulsion beyond its borders . Any failure to comply with processing instructions will be met with use of force . Take a look at them , Plissken . Prostitutes , atheists , runaways . We 're throwing out the trash . " S.D. Bob Plissken , Special Forces . " Two Purple Hearts . Youngest man ever decorated by the President . Rescued a different President in ' 97 . So what happened to you , war hero ? You were the best we had . Now you 're just like one of them . You had it all , and you turned away from your country . Why ? The whole nation 's watching , every good and decent person who works hard and follows the rules . Be my guest . What do you have to say , Plissken ? Call me Snake . You are now entering the processing area . The next scheduled departure to L.A. is in one hour . Get over there ! You now have the option to repent of your sins and be electrocuted on the premises . If you elect this option , notify the cleric sergeant in your processing area . How 's it going , hotshot ? You know , I got to admit , I thought we had you in Cleveland . - Come on . Tell me . How 'd you do it ? - Get to the deal . - What ? - You need me for something . What is it ? Show him . At 1 030 hours , Wednesday , a group of government officials began a tour of the Benford Space Defense Lab . The President 's daughter Utopia was among them . Somehow during the tour , she came into possession of a top-secret prototype unit . One hour later , she boarded Air Force Three for Lynchburg . To the American people , now is the time to rise up and demand the surrender of the President and his corrupt theocracy of lies and terror ! At 1 140 hours , she hijacked Air Force Three . We scanned this onto the VR . Check it out . Today is day one of a brand-new world . The days of empire are finished . To the President , my father . You know what 's in here , and unless you open your borders , allow all the wrongfully accused to return to their country , I will use this on you and on the United States . Her emergency escape pod landed somewhere in L.A. Her ELT signal ceased immediately . After that , silence . We sent in a five-man rescue team . Within a few hours of landing on the island , all but one of them was killed . One hell of a team . - Skip the commentary , Plissken . - Snake . Call me Snake . Get on with it . Right after her sister committed suicide , Utopia began to withdraw from life into her virtual reality simulator . She 'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time . Somebody else was in there with her . Utopia made tapes of her VR experiences and then tried to erase them , but she missed one five-second image . We ran a data scan and found this fragment on the end of her last tape . Cuervo Jones . Peruvian terrorist . Member of the Shining Path . Runs the Mescalito Justice , the biggest , baddest gang in L.A. Somehow , Cuervo Jones managed to tap into the VR master data bank . Utopia was lonely , looking for something to believe in , and so he used her to steal the black box . - Sad story . You got a smoke ? - This is serious , Plissken . The black box is a matter of national security . It looks like it belongs to Utopia 's lover-boy now . - Yeah . We want it back . - l 'll bet . What 's it do ? Top secret . Only on a need-to-know . Evidently , I don 't need to know , so fuck you. I 'm going to Hollywood . If you go into L.A. , bring back the black box , and you will receive a full pardon for every immoral act you have ever committed in the United States . - Sounds familiar . - An immediate answer . Yes or no ? - Who are you ? - l 'm your president . I understand you got some domestic problems . Put that black box in my hand , and you 're a free man . I can see you 're real concerned about your daughter . Utopia is lost to me . My daughter is gone . - Last chance , hotshot . - For what ? - Freedom , sir . - ln America ? That died a long time ago . All right. I 've heard enough of this . Explain to this foot soldier why he 's going to do what we tell him to do . - What 's he talking about ? - The Plutoxin 7 virus . Genetically engineered . 1 00 % pure death . Complete nervous system shutdown . You crash . You bleed out like a stuck pig . It 's not a pretty sight . I see . You figure you inject that shit into me and I 'll do whatever you want , just like New York ? - You got it , Snake . - One question . Which one of you assholes gets to die trying to stick me ? You don 't understand . It 's already in you . Catches on quick , doesn 't he ? Your countdown clock is now activated . Designer viruses , Plissken . Wave of the future . Right now you 've got less than 1 0 hours to live . It 's already moving through your bloodstream . Go ahead . Put your hand on that touch pad . Of course , there is an antidote and it neutralizes the virus immediately upon injection . Which I will personally authorize once your mission is completed . The man is too dumb to survive L.A. We 're holograms , Plissken . Give us a little credit . We 're not that stupid . Get this crap out of me . I guess we 've got a deal . Nice to be working with you , hotshot . You 'd better hope I don 't make it back . All of you . Core burner . Magnesium ammo . Five hundred extra rounds . Oral projectile . Mouth dart . The dart is filled with urolyde . It will stun the enemy for several seconds . Every member of the rescue team had a tracking chip implanted in his arm . I think one of them might still be alive . Use the tracer in your watch to locate him . This is a holocam . It 's a portable holographic camera . It 'll project your image up to a half mile away . 1 00 % audio send and receive capabilities . It 's a prototype . Confuse and deceive the enemy . Now , it has a mini-nuke battery good for about 8 minutes , but you can only use it once . So you better save it for when it counts . Stick matches . Plain , old-fashioned stick matches . Never know when you might need them . - Where are my guns ? - l thought you might want those . Stealth clothing . Fire retardant , nullifies heat detection . Put them on . - l 'll take the coat . - You 'll take them all . All right . Listen up , Plissken . L.A. ' s being primed as a beachhead for an invasion of the United States . War is about to be declared , Plissken , or didn 't you know ? That 's right. I forgot . You don 't give a shit , do you ? Cuervo Jones runs with Shining Path . And their goal is to take back North America . It 's the revenge of pre-industrial societies . Shining Path has united all Third World countries . The Cubans and Brazilians are poised to invade Miami . If the Ugandans and Colombians make a run at the border , we 've got a full-scale attack on the United States . High stakes , hotshot . - How am I going in ? - Under the San Fernando Sea . Shark 3 submarine . One-man submersible . Just like the turbine model , only this one 's nuclear-powered . It 's very simple . Throttle up , keep it in the green , throttle back . You 'll put ashore at the Cahuenga Pass . Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl . Use your tracer to locate the last member of the rescue team . If he survived , he 's the only source of information you 'll have on the island . - Do I bring him back , too ? - No . Negative . Figures . For all we know , he 's already dead . In any case , once you go inside , you 're on your own . When the black box is secure , get back to the submarine as fast as you can . It 's your only way out . Plissken ! You know what to do with the girl . This nation doesn 't need to waste any more time and money on bullshit trials for high treason . - Kill her . - ls that an order from the President ? Absolutely . Or let 's just say it 's what 's best for the country . By the way , who gives me the antidote ? - A medical team will be standing by . - Neither one of you ? - No . - Good . Thought you might try that , hotshot . That 's why the first clip is loaded with blanks . Bye-bye , Snake . Good luck . Nice and easy now . Com check . Yeah. I 'm here . Stand by for launch . 8 hours , 8 minutes , 26 seconds to neuro-system shutdown . Ignite her . Fuel rod injection . She 's in the green . Lock fuel rods . - Locked . - Nuclear turbine to 75 % power . - 75 % power . - Hands on switches and counting . Five , four , three , two , one . Launch ! Hey , watch your speed , hotshot . There 's lots of obstructions down there . His reactor 's starting to overheat . Slow it down , Plissken . You 're overloading the power plant . You slow down , dickhead . I 'm the one who 's dying . Plissken ! Power plant overload . Guidance systems malfunction . You no longer have control of stick function . Obstruction dead ahead . Plissken . Yeah. I 'm here . Cahuenga Pass . What the hell happened to the submarine ? Disappeared off our screens . Plissken ! I got to go . Too bad about your boat , man , but we 'd appreciate it if you 'd stay off our beach . Just passing through . You look kind of familiar . - What do you want ? - Nothing , dude . - l just realized who you are . That 's all . - That 's all ? Come on , man . I 'm not looking for trouble . You know , I used to see you a lot when I surfed the birds . See you on the Police Channel . You 're pretty far out , Snake . I mean , cool . But I kind of thought you 'd be taller . Which way to the Hollywood Bowl ? Down that way . It 's just an aftershock . No big deal . We get them all the time . Thanks for not killing me , man . I owe you one . Acid rain . Hey , Snake , what are you doing here anyway ? I heard they busted your hump pretty good down in Cleveland . Location of rescue team member . 50 yards southeast from your present position . Location of rescue team member . 40 yards from your present position . Rescue team member is located 10 feet from your present position . Hey , man . 1 00 bucks says you can 't put three blades into him . You want a throw ? - Hey , one-eye , I 'm talking to you , man . - Where can I find Cuervo Jones ? What do I look like , a fucking tour guide ? Hey ! - lt 's wintertime , baby . - l 'm looking for Cuervo Jones . Why ? You work for Hershe ? I heard she 's looking for Cuervo , too . - Where is he ? - You can see him on Sunset . He 's supposed to be coming by any time now . - Sunset . - Boulevard . You really are new , aren 't you ? Come on , baby. I 'll show you . Keep going down that way , honey . You can 't miss it . Hey , one-eye ! Look in my face when I talk to you , shit-heel . Neuro-system shutdown , seven hours . Plissken . - Yeah . Go ahead . - Did you find the team member ? Yeah . They 're using him for target practice . - He 's not going to be much help . - What are you going to do ? Amigos , no matter where you come from , no matter what color your skin is , we 're all one raza . - The raza of the oppressed ... - Watch the parade . What ? Yeah , but today , we 've got the north by the balls . Come on ! Right ? Right ? Meet me at the Happy Kingdom . Let 's party tonight , because tomorrow we 're going to start our way back to glory ! Hey ! Yeah ! We got our freedom ! We got a future ! That looks like Snake Plissken . - Who ? - He used to be a gunfighter . Kind of faded out from the scene a few years ago . I hear he slowed down some . Doesn 't look that slow , Cuervo . Watch it ! Watch it ! No problem ! No ! Nobody rolls into town and disrespects me . Not Snake Plissken , not nobody . Okay , okay , you got me ! No , no , don 't ... Take him out ! I 'm going to give you assholes a chance . What do you say we play a little Bangkok rules ? Nobody draws until this hits the ground . You ready ? Draw . Hey , he left his coat here , man . Malloy . I 'm here , Plissken . Have you got the black box ? Negative , and I just lost the core burner and the holocam . I don 't need to know what your problems are , Plissken . I just want my black box . Now , you 've got seven and a half hours . Do you read me ? Listen to me , Malloy . This guy 's got more heat around him than the President . Now , I can get your precious little box back , but I 'm going to need more time . You understand ? You listen to me , Plissken . That little headache that just kicked in will only get worse . You 're starting to feel the effects of the virus . Soon you 'll have a fever followed by a lack of energy . Now , you bear that in mind . Just push on through , soldier . Don 't shoot . Don 't shoot . I thought it was you . Yeah . I recognized you right away . I 've been hanging out around here for more years than I want to think about , but I never thought I 'd see Snake Plissken cruising Sunset Boulevard . It 's a real pleasure to meet you . I 'm Map to the Stars Eddie . Where 's Cuervo Jones ' place ? He 's the man with the juice , Snake . He 's got the President 's daughter . He 's setting up something big , but I got a feeling you know all about that , right ? - Location . - That way . And if you 're going to go through Beverly Hills , you 're going to need a map . It 's prerecorded. I narrated it myself . Welcome to your very own map to the stars . That 's me . Sure , we all know the big one wiped out the entertainment industry here in L.A. , but the glamour and excitement of Hollywood is still alive , so come with me and see where the stars ... Hey , Snake , you 're going to need this . I 'm telling you . All right. I 'll give you a deal . 50,000 bucks . That 's a real bargain . And here we go . Sucker . Stay down , man , or they 'll see you . This is only their second shift . You make one move , and we 're done . And don 't make noise . If you want to make noise , go and find another bush . You 're the one making all the noise . Shit ! - Plissken 's tracerjust went down . - Terminated ? Yes , sir . We can 't even locate him on heat seek . - He 's wearing stealth . - Now what ? We sit tight , and we wait for the man to communicate with us . Wait ? For how long ? He 's probably dead . Wait , Mr. President . Be patient . I told you to stay down . Now look what you 've done . I can 't believe this . Are you Snake Plissken ? You look like him in a way . By the way , genius , we 're both dead meat . - What are they ? - Surgical failures . They live here . Too many implants and face-lifts over the years . Their muscles turn to Jell-O . The only way they survive is to have fresh body parts transplanted over and over again . - Oh , my God . - Who 's that ? The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills . These are no good . You couldn 't give them away . And this , I can do nothing with this one . Yeah . Wheel it away . All right , you heard what the man said . Get rid of it . I can 't work with garbage like this . Now , these two ... They look very good . My God , they 're real . What a beautiful blue eye . Shame he only has one . Nurse . Still , one eye 's better than none . Anybody moves , I blow his brains out and then yours . You , get my guns . Now . Back off . Now , everybody , relax , and he won 't die . Hey . Hey , man , help me . You 're never going to find your way out of here without me . Really . Cut her down . Hey , get somebody . Down there . Quickly . Get in . I think we lost them . I think we 're lost . This way . I used to run guns with the Black Jihad last year . We drove golf carts up and down these tunnels . I know them like the back of my hand . - You are Snake Plissken , aren 't you ? - l used to be . I thought you 'd be taller . - So , what are you doing in L.A. ? - l 'm dying . But first you got to find something ? President 's daughter . She 's with Cuervo Jones . So you want to go to Cuervo 's place ? - l 've been there once . - Show me . All right . I used to hear about you all the time , like they could never catch you no matter what you did . Very cool , Snake . Sooner or later , they get everybody . Up . Cuervo Jones ' place is down that way . Get off at the Vermont exit . Go south . You can 't miss it . Be careful , though . This is Korean Dragon territory . It 's very dangerous around here . Bye . Snake ? When you find the President 's daughter , are you going to take her back ? No . - So you are staying in L.A. ? - Not if I can help it . Sun is coming up in a few hours . U.V. ' s going to be bad today . I know a place where we could crash if you want . My boyfriend and I broke up tonight , so , I 'd love to take care of you and make you feel good . I 'll read your future . The future is right now . ... they gather their sins against the soul of the righteous and condemn the innocent blood . Dear God , we call on you to be our defense , our rock and our refuge . Let us pray . We give thanks for being alive and pray that in your mercy ... Snake , it 's me , Taslima . I 'm coming with you to Cuervo 's place . Yeah ? They 're new . They don 't belong to any gang . They 're just scared , that 's all . That 's how I was when they first deported me . Why are you here ? I was a Muslim in South Dakota . All of a sudden , they made it a crime . I mean , why do you stay ? You can go south , Mexico . L.A. ' s still the place , Snake . If you think about what 's happened on the other side of the world , that 's the prison . This is the only free zone left , anywhere . Dark paradise . At least we get something out of the deal . A girl can still wear a fur coat if she wants to , for example . No , no , no . Once you figure out this place , it 's really not so bad . Get down ! - Where 's it coming from ? - The car in the street below ! Hop in , Snake . Come on . Didn 't think I 'd see you again . How 'd you get out of Beverly Hills ? Nobody ever gets out of there alive . Yeah . Maybe that 's why you let me walk in there . Come on , man. I tried to tell you , you need one of my maps to get around . - Shut up down there ! - Give it back ! You got to start listening to me , Snake . I got connections around here . If you need anything , I 'm the man to see . You can 't just be walking around town without knowing the ropes . You take the wrong street , you 're dead , pal . Stop the car . All right , Snake . Anything you say . Although , I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones ' place . Where is it ? It 's right over there . It 's pretty neat , huh ? This is Cuervo 's car . He lets me use it sometimes . Hey , not to worry , Snake . You 've just been shot with a fun gun . Feel it ? You feel it ? It 's pure mesh , man , 1 00-proof artery choker . It 's like Cuervo says , when the hit pulls you down to one inch from death , that is living , man . You should 've talked to me first . I could 've set this thing up . I 'm actually Cuervo 's agent , you know , and I would love to represent you , too . We could make a bundle . I know I could help your career . I mean , you 're a legend and all , but last couple of years , it 's like you 've fallen off the face of the earth . Cuervo , I delivered him , didn 't I ? I figured out what the cops sent him in to do . Plissken was the second rescue team . He was supposed to get the black box and the girl and take them back out over the wall . All I 'm asking for is a finder 's fee after you take over . Maybe Wisconsin. I don 't know . - Okay . We 're almost set up , Cuervo . - Good . Well , I originally heard about this when I was working for NASA . Check this out . Common , ordinary remote-control unit . Yeah ? Everyone 's got one , right ? Here 's the kicker . This instruction disk hooks you right into the Sword of Damocles , the ultimate defensive weapon system . You see that ? There 's a ring of satellites encircling the Earth . Attached to each satellite is a mega neutron bomb . When detonated , each satellite unleashes an intense electromagnetic pulse , but EMP doesn 't harm a living thing . What it does do is shut down every known power source , all electrical devices , cars , airplanes , toasters , computers , everything , even batteries . But this makes this an aiming device that gives the user incredible accuracy . You can pinpoint precisely what you want to shut down , a taxicab in Buenos Aires , the entire country of Spain . Amazing . Brilliant . Hell , you could key in all the satellites and shut down the whole planet , send it right back to the Dark Ages . - Let 's face it . He 's dead . - l agree . Plissken 's been dead so many times I can 't count them all . - But he never stays down . - The mission 's scrubbed , Commander . I should never have let you talk me out of that air strike . Well , it 's on now , effective immediately , full-scale . Target Los Angeles . Flatten it . Burn it . No ! What did you say to me ? Cuervo Jones is holding all the cards now , sir . He sees our aircraft come in , he pushes that button , kaboom ! There goes our aircraft , and there goes the United States ofAmerica . We don 't even know if he knows how to work the goddamn thing . Snake Plissken , American outlaw . You 're going to like this . Remember , Cuervo , you got to punch in the world code first . 666 . That brings all the satellites on line . Then you can aim the prototype . - Hey , pendejo , you think I 'm stupid ? - No . No . No. I 'm sorry , Cuervo . Bring them in . Okay , okay , go on . Hello , North America . Yes , I am Cuervo Jones ... Wait a minute . That 's Plissken . This is the real L.A. , people without hope , without a country . I knew it . He 's alive . Do you know what they want ? Liberation . Now it 's their turn . I 'm taking over with this . Now , I told you not to try to get this back , didn 't I ? But you disobeyed me . Well ... He 's entering the target code . Bend over , Mr. President . Time for a spanking . He 's targeting Lynchburg . That 'll shut down the capital . - Patch me in to the White House . - Say goodnight to the missus . This broadcast is going out live all across the country . Yes , this is the President . Get me my wife , please . - Are you watching TV ? I mean , my God ! - Yes , Eve , yes , I know . - Do you see what 's going on ? - l 'm watching it , too . - Who is this guy ? He says you ... - Yes , I know . ... curfew . Hello ? Hello ? Hey , Presidente , silence is golden , no ? Don 't tell me you didn 't enjoy this just a little bit . I mean , if your wife is anything like your daughter , she 's sweet to eat , but you just can 't shut her up . - Hey , knock it off , Cuervo . - All right , now this is set . We shut down the entire United States . I want a police chopper to come and get me at the Happy Kingdom no later than 5 : 00 a.m. Once I 'm airborne , you 'll get your orders . Remember , don 't piss me off , or I 'll pull the plug . I 'm at the mercy of this madman . - Don 't count Plissken out , sir . - He 's tanked . He 's a POW . But he 's still alive . Six , five , four , three , two , one . Shot clock ! - Well , this is insane . - lt is . That 's the point . All right , all right . Hey ! I promised you tonight was going to be special . I also promised you one last great spectacle of death here in this historic arena . Now you will see that death . I give you the death of Snake Plissken ! Come on , you pansy ! Some people think you 're already dead , Snake . Some say you never will be . Because you may have survived Cleveland , you may have escaped from New York , but this is L.A. , vato . And you 're about to find out that this fucking city can kill anybody ! - L.A. ! L.A. ! L.A. ! - L.A. ! L.A. ! L.A. ! Game time ! Basketball . Two hoops . Full court . Ten-second shot clock . Miss a shot , you get shot . Shot clock buzzer goes off before you shoot , you get shot . Two points for a basket . No three-point bullshit . All you got to do is make 10 points . That 's it . By the way , nobody 's ever walked off that court alive . Nobody . All right ! Ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one . Ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one . Ten , nine , eight , seven ... Nice shot . He 's getting tired now . ... four , three , two , one . Snake ! Snake ! Snake ! - Snake ! Snake ! Snake ! - Snake ! Snake ! Snake ! This town loves a winner . - Snake ! Snake ! Snake ! - Snake ! Snake ! Snake ! He won , Cuervo . You can 't kill him . I have to . Get off ! Free shot ! It 's the big one ! Find him ! We 're going to Anaheim . Come here . Cuervo . Cuervo , wait up . - Give me a minute , man . - Get lost , agent ! Come on . We got a relationship here , man . Let me make something clear to you . I 'm starting to get irritated , and that 's not a good thing . lrritated with me ? Cuervo , I 'm taking care of you . I 'm with you in all this . Don 't you understand ? We can 't find him , Cuervo . So keep looking ! Get in the car . If I 'm being too rough on you , you just let me know , okay ? Snake ! Don 't shoot. it 's me , Utopia . I 'm alone . This whole place is a nightmare . Cuervo 's a killer . He 's worse than my father . I want to go back with you . Oh , my God . My father sent you to kill me , didn 't he ? Shit . Get out of here . Go . Wait . You can 't take that back , Snake . Oh , God . You can 't give that to him . All he wants to do is control everything , just like Cuervo . If I don 't take it back , I 'm dead . Not another one ! Run ! It 's over . Get me a complete damage report as soon as possible . Yes , sir . Thank God almighty . Maybe that 's the answer to all of our problems . Maybe . Maybe they 're all dead . Maybe . Cuervo , man ! We almost bought the farm . The whole place just fell in right behind us . Where is Plissken ? He 's down there . He 's dead . He 's history , and I did it . I killed him , man. I shot him . Right ? Tell him . - Give it to me . - Yeah . I brought it back to you , Cuervo . It 's all there . Dude , is that you , Snake ? Far out , man . Hey , did you find Cuervo , man ? Hey , Cuervo , wait. I 've done it all , man . I killed Plissken. I got your girl back . I gave you all the marbles . - Just for you , Cuervo , just for ... - So where is he ? I shot him . He went down , okay ? I mean ... His body 's probably washed down into Wilshire Canyon somewhere . Good ! So then you know where he is . Bring me his head . - Where 's the Happy Kingdom ? - Anaheim . It 's the staging area for the big invasion . The whole town 's going to be there , except me . I 'm staying right here , man . I 'm ready for the big wave . It 's going to be some eternal one . - Take me there . - What ? - Take me there . - Hey , man . You 're not doing so well , Snake . You need help . Here . Here . Hold on . - Who shot you ? - lt doesn 't matter . Well , yeah , you 're right . You should talk to Hershe . She hates Cuervo , big-time . They used to be partners , and they split up . - Who ? - Hershe . She lives downtown in a big boat , down that way . She hangs with Saigon Shadow . Man , they don 't take shit from nobody . - What is that ? - Tsunami , Snake . Tsunami ! Surf 's up big-time now , mister . Start feeling better quick , man , 'cause you ain 't got time to get out of here . This is going to be some kind of ride , man . Some kind of bitching ride . Let 's go . Come on . Bitching , man ! Okay . Let the front edge pick you up . Don 't get on your board till you ride to the top . Don 't blow it , man. lf you fall off the board , it 's the big wipeout . Got it ? Bitching ! Hang on , Snake . You got to be kidding me . - Later . - Snake ! Yeah ! You 're going to tell me how to get downtown . - Somebody named Hershe . - Yeah , sure , Snake . No problem . Hey , hey ! - Are you going to kill me ? - Hershe . Right . Keep going straight . Two blocks down , make a right . Warning . Neuro-system shutdown , one hour . I first met Hershe when I got deported . She helped set me up in business . We 're talking a power player , Snake . Cuervo 's got the numbers and the firepower , but Hershe 's got a burning spine made out of steel . Big-time fast-lane ambitions . Think about it . The two of you hooked up together , I 'm talking box-office material here . What ? Easy , Snake. I see him , too . We 're okay . Come on . She 's going to love you , Snake . You 're going to love her , too . We 're going to make this thing happen . By the way , I 'm through with Cuervo . The guy 's got no sense of loyalty whatsoever . Right through here . - What ? - Hey , man , how you doing ? Long time , no see . Remember me ? Map to the Stars Eddie . Yeah , well , I got somebody I want Hershe to meet . Snake Plissken , baby , right here in the flesh . Your gun . Great . Thanks , pal . All right , we 're in . Look , strange scene in here . Let me do the talking . Hey , Hershe , how you doing ? Hang on . Hang on , guys . This is big . It 's Snake Plissken . I brought him here to see you , Hershe . He 's got a little business proposition . - What 's in it for me ? - Wait a minute . I know that voice . Yeah . You 're Carjack Malone . Not anymore . You two know each other ? Well , the more things change , the more they stay the same , huh , Carjack ? Glad to see you 're still packing a gun between your legs . - Hold on , honey ... - You owe me . You bolted on me back in Cleveland . Hershe , you were in Cleveland ? Yeah , with me and Texas Mike O 'Shea , except you looked a little different in those days , Carjack . You get one thing straight , Plissken . I 'm no longer Carjack Malone . I 'm Hershe Las Palmas , the most drop-dead , to-die-for number you ever laid that one eye on . I don 't give a fuck what you are . I wanna know what happened - to you in Cleveland ... - l was called away on urgent business . - l got caught , and you didn 't . - Don 't lie to me ! All right , so I made another deal . I got my ass kicked , not you . - l 've been in here five years , not you . - l got a new deal for you . You help me , you live . I wouldn 't do that , Snake . You see , we all have an agreement . Anything happens to me and you 're dead . I 'm already dead . I see your point . What 's the deal ? Get me to Cuervo Jones. I got one hour . Dream on , blue eye . - Say good night , Carjack . - Hold on ! Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies . No one gets near him . And he 's got the black box and the girl . He 's running the show . What black box ? The one that shuts down the power permanently . Yeah , right ! And the Plutoxin 7 virus is going to kill you in less than 1 0 hours . - What ? - lt 's bullshit , baby . Rumor control . Government propaganda . - Just one more lie . - Snake 's telling the truth , Hershe . I used to represent the guy who invented it . - Swear to God , Snake . - Hey , hey . What 's the deal , gorgeous ? We get the girl and the black box , and we get out of here . All of us ? Yeah . Me , too ? Why should we leave ? I love L.A. Where we going to go ? What 's the big payoff ? The President 's promised to give whoever helps me $ 1 million . Yeah ? A million greenbacks ? I got 1 0 million of them in the next room . Bluebacks . - Come on , Snake . - Bluebacks . I swear to God , Eddie . This is bigger than Cleveland . It sounds thin to me . You want to stay here while Cuervo Jones rules the world ? Hell , no . That sucks . So how are we going to get out ? I 'll tell you that when we get there . Plissken , man , you are such a loser ! Man , making up shit along the way . That 's why I left your ass in Cleveland . You 're just a chump just like the rest of us . No deal ! Government chopper . It 'll be there . Okay , that 's better . So how are we getting there in under an hour ? That 's your end . Edward ? The best you could do from here is take the five . The shape it 's in , two and a half hours minimum . No , use the air . You 're burning . The Santa Anas . The night wind . - What are you talking about ? - Death from above . I don 't know about these things . You don 't like it , don 't come . Where 'd you get these rigs , Carjack ? My name is Hershe . Do you understand , Plissken ? I got an idea . Got any red nail polish on you ? What ? Come on . - l expect that back , Eddie . - Yeah , yeah . There. lt looks just like the Sword of Damocles instruction CD . Maybe we can pull a Texas switch on Cuervo . - Yeah , if he lets you get close enough . - Don 't worry . Let 's do it ! The wind 's up . Come on . Let 's go ! Neuro-system shutdown , 34 minutes . - Cuervo ! Cuervo ! Cuervo ! - Cuervo ! Cuervo ! Cuervo ! Are you ready for the new world ? The attack is now under way ! - What 's going on ? - l don 't know. I think we 're fucked ! Get out here ! Get out of there ! Do you see Plissken anywhere ? Neuro-system shutdown , 25 minutes . Get my jet ready . Get it fueled and ready to go . You can 't run away now. lt 's too late . You have to stand , face it down . Mr. President . Commander , we are receiving reports from Miami . An armada of warships has just departed Cuba . ETA , the Florida coast in 45 minutes . They 're starting the invasion . I 've got to go to my quarters ! I 've got to pray ! Go with him . Make sure he doesn 't do anything crazy . Hey , Eddie , is that what I think it is ? Yeah . The place kept changing owners . Finally went bankrupt . The thing in Paris killed them . We 're going to need some kind of diversion . Let 's go . Hey , Cuervo ! Hey ! Hey , Cuervo ! I made it ! I made it ! Wait for me ! Oh , shit ! Hey , Cuervo ! Will you please kill him for me ? Hey ! Hey ! I got news ! There 's about to be an attack ! You 're about to get hit , man . It 's Plissken . Plissken ? - You told me that you shot him dead . - Yeah , I thought I did . But I found him , sort of , alive . Sort of . Where ? - Cuervo . - What ? - lt 's so good to see you . - Where is Plissken ? - He 's near . - You 're stalling , Eddie . Jeez ! Talk , little gringo , or I 'll rip your balls off . Look out behind you ! You have lied to me for the very last time . Come on , hurry up ! Let 's go ! Get inside the chopper. lt 's bulletproof . I 'll take my coat back now , asshole . - Take me back , Snake . - Secure the latch . - You got the remote . Great . - Yeah . Now give me the real one . What ? I didn 't make a switch . Yes , you did. I saw you . Give me that gun ! Damn it . Carjack , we 're hooked up on your side . I hit him ! Hey ! You get back here , Plissken ! Aircraft has entered quadrant four , sir . - l 'm getting radio contact . - Boost it . Malloy . Get the antidote ready , assholes . I 'm coming in . This is Malloy , Plissken . Do you have the black box ? I got what was in it , remote control unit , instruction disk . Get the trucks rolling . We 're on fire . Neuro-system shutdown , two minutes , 27 seconds . All emergency vehicles proceed to the north perimeter . Shit ! Shit ! This is a full alert . Where the hell is he going ? Get ready to jump . Head for the tree line and disappear . Go . Go ! Thank God almighty ! Thank God almighty ! Welcome back , sir . Give me the goddamn shot . Your countdown clock has now terminated function . Your time is up . - l told you he was dumb . - You took the fake , hotshot . Plutoxin 7 is a fast , hard-hitting case of the flu . Pretty good . Relax , war hero . We took you for a little ride , and you came through . Now , give me that unit . You want this thing ? Come and get it . - Sir . - What can he do ? Let go of me ! Quit it ! You didn 't finish the mission , Snake . Looks like I 'll have to do it for you . Hold it , Mr. President . Shit . We 'll take this one . Get her out of here . Daddy . Take her to the chair . For he so loved his country , he gave his only seditious child . Prepare to broadcast . Worldwide ! She didn 't know that she had that remote unit in her pocket , now , did she ? I was wondering what kind of lame switch you 'd try to pull this time , Plissken . You know , you 're becoming very predictable . Yeah , I guess so . You got a smoke ? The United States is a no-smoking nation . No smoking , no drinking , no drugs , no women , unless , of course , you 're married . No guns , no foul language , no red meat . Land of the free . I don 't need the teleprompter . This is the President of the United States . I now demand an immediate retreat of all forces now threatening this great nation . If my demand is not met immediately , I will destroy your ability to function permanently . Mr. President , the Cuban theater of aggression remains mobile . - ETA , Miami in 4 minutes . - 4 minutes ? Bring the aiming coordinates for Cuba and Mexico on line . Cuba 7-7-9 . 7-7-9 . I now render this final solution . Welcome to your very own map to the stars . Sure , we all know the big one wiped out the entertainment industry here in L.A. , but the glamour and excitement of Hollywood is still alive ... Very funny . Yeah . I hope it was worth it , for now you are going to die . Everybody does . Kill him and bring me the real unit . - Sir , we 're still broadcasting . - Good ! Let them watch ! Do it ! On my command ! Fire ! He 's not even here ! He 's a hologram ! Catches on quick , doesn 't she ? He 's got to be within a half-mile radius . - Round up every available man . - Hold it . Sir , the enemy is less than two minutes from our shore . What 's it to be , Plissken , us or them ? Shut down the Third World , they lose , you win . Shut down America , you lose , they win . The more things change , the more they stay the same . So what are you going to do ? Disappear . He 's entered the world code . No target code . Sir , that will shut down the entire planet . I told you you 'd better hope I didn 't make it back . You push that button , everything we 've accomplished for the past 500 years will be finished . Our technology , our way of life , our entire history . We 'll have to start all over again . For God sakes , don 't do it , Snake ! The name 's Plissken . He did it . He shut down the Earth . Welcome to the human race .

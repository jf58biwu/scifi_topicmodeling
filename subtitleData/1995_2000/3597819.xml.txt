 [ Coughing ] Excuse me . You want that warmed up ? No , but I 'll buy another one if you leave me alone . [ Coughing ] [ Beeps ] We 'll see about that . Eight ball . [ Ringing ] Yeah . [ Man ] hello , Jackson . How 'd you get this number ? What do you care ? Your partner , Kenny Slater , he took your money , didn 't he ? I want to help you , Jackson . Help me what ? Slater 's in the metro diner . Fourteenth and Arlington . He 's in Florida by now , man . Jamaica or Cuba . No , he 's here , in the metro diner . Fourteenth and Arlington . Fourteenth and Arlington . It 's Kenny . The fool 's come back . [ Man ] the men who took your product Friday night are in the metro diner . Fourteenth and Arlington . [ Click ] ? [ Rap on stereo ] [ phone ringing ] Spanish jack is in the metro diner . Fourteenth and Arlington . I understand you wish to speak with him . Fourteenth and Arlington . [ Cell phone ringing ] Boyce . Pico Salazar 's in the metro diner . Salazar ? Who is this ? Fourteenth and Arlington . [ Tires squealing ] [ Beeps ] Sharper than a serpent 's tooth ... To have a thankless child . [ Computer beeps ] [ Bell on door jingles ] Now you know what 's coming , And there 's nothing you can do . [ Beeping ] [ Bell on door jingles ] You won 't feel a thing . [ Beeps ] U.S. Marshals ! On the floor ! - No ! - Down ! Down ! No ! [ Gunfire ] [ People chattering ] Charles Figgis , ten-Year veteran of the U.S. Marshal 's service . Multiple gunshot wounds . High-Speed Teflon rounds . His partner , Gerald Boyce , was D.O.A. at Mercy General . Tried to catch a nine-Millimeter slug in his teeth . Looks like they crashed the wrong party . Figgis and Boyce had radioed in that they were coming to apprehend Pico Salazar . Pico Salazar ? The Colombia cartel 's banking liaison . Salazar escaped from federal custody three months ago . Boyce and Figgis were on the offender transport squad that lost them . They took his escape personally . A phone tip told them that Salazar was going to be here tonight . A foreign national with his kind of connections ? What would he be doing here , let alone in the country ? I don 't think he is , or was . But there were a lot of very photogenic gentlemen who were . [ Camera shutter clicks ] [ Scully ] Mulder , these are street-Level coke dealers . Minor wholesalers at most . Yeah . Not the type you 'd expect to associate with a cartel boss . What would they be doing here ? Maybe it was for the pie . It 's 2 : 45 in the morning . You mind telling me what it is we 're supposed to be looking for ? - Donald Gelman . - Who ? Donald Gelman , silicon valley software pioneer . He 's been missing since 1979 . And you recognize him ? He invented the internet . He didn 't quite invent it , but he 's a Silicon Valley folk hero . He was writing internet software even before there was an internet . Why have I never heard of him ? On the eve of the deal ... That was gonna set him up as another Bill Gates , He went hiking and said he 'd think about it ; never came back . I still don 't see the connection . Maybe that 's the point . Folks , I 'm gonna have to ask you to stay back , please . So , why was Gelman in there ? I think someone obviously wanted him dead . You think this was a hit on him ? Eight unconnected dealers all in the same place at the same time ? All tipped off by phone , looking for somebody ? Last call goes to the marshals . They arrive ; the place explodes . Gelman dies in the cross fire . It 's genius . Mulder , did you take a look at him back there ? A man who was dying . His body was a bag of bones . When you talk about Gelman , you want to kill the brain , not the body . - Mulder , that 's evidence . - Gee , I hope so . ? [ " Twilight time " ] ? Heavenly shades of night are falling ? ? It 's twilight time ? ? Out of the mist your voice is calling ? ? It 's twilight time ? ? When purple-Colored curtains mark the end of day ? Jobs and Wozniak at apple , Gates and Allen writing basic , The homebrew computer club 's first meetings- - Gelman was there . Now they 're power brokers and billionaires . Back then , they were just ... - Inspired nerds . - All except Gelman . Gelman was a part of the group but not one of them . At 28 , he was the old man . - Some say the brightest of all . - He wrote the earliest viruses . And found himself under investigation by the N.S.A. Is that why he disappeared ? Gelman ? Gelman was a visionary , not a capitalist . A subversive . This is a " one-of . " I 've never seen anything like it . - Gelman built this ? - That may be what got him killed . Heavy casualty . A brother goes down . I found this in his CD-Rom drive . - What is it ? - " Twilight time . " ? Together at last at twilight time ? We 're up against 64-Bit encryption , A password that 's a random sequence of 12 symbols . Gelman 's got this baby sealed tight . [ Byers ] this CD has some kind of enhanced background data . Lots of code . Maybe a program he designed . What for ? Anyone think to check his e - Mail ? [ Byers ] " David missing . Fear the worst . The hunted has become the hunter . " - " Invisigoth " ? - Could be an address . Seven digits . An alphanumeric string of four . That 's standard I.D. A shipping container . There must be a thousand containers here . And in no particular order . Frohike says this place is really proud of its accurate tracking . If not in their computer security . Yeah . Should be straight ahead . Three rows and to the right . ? [ Rock guitar ] Sounds like somebody 's home . - ? [ Continues ] F.B.I. ! [ Shouts ] - Mulder ? - I 'm all right . Go . Enter . Stop ! F.B.I. ! F.B.I. ! Stop or I 'll shoot ! [ Shot fires ] Thank you . Home sweet home . - Are you invisigoth ? - How did you find me ? Donald Gelman 's mailbox . You left a return address . You know where Donald is ? Let us ask the questions . - Why don 't you bite me ? - Hey . Like , what you 're doing here and what all this stuff is . Why would I tell you , even if you could understand ? You just committed felony assault on a federal agent , followed by resisting arrest . Arrest for what ? Unless you got a warrant , you just busted in here ... And seriously violated a buttload of my constitutional rights . - We had just cause to come in . - [ Computer beeping ] [ Beeping ] Now we 've got just cause to get out . - What is that ? - A surveillance module that monitors computing processes . [ Beeping ] - It 's locking on . - What is ? A D.O.D. satellite . Warp upgrade orbital weapons platform . We gotta get out of here . - A weapons platform ? - Scully ? That thing has optical systems that can read headlines on a newspaper . Scully- - It 's targeting us ! [ Scully ] the Department of Defense wants to kill you ? No , it 's controlling their satellite . You 're out of your mind . Scully , we gotta get out of here right now . [ Computer beeping ] Mulder , this is absurd ! - It 's locked . Give me the keys . - Mulder ! We 're all gonna die ! Give me the keys ! - [ Beeping ] - Come on ! Get in the car , Scully . No more screwing around . We need a name . Your real name . Invisigoth . You want my address ? It 's T-O-A-S-T . When you said " it " was targeting us back there , you meant an artificial intelligence . Donald Gelman was trying to create ascension A.I. , A program with its own consciousness . He succeeded , didn 't he ? Donald wrote an interlocking sequence of viruses 15 years ago . - It got loose on the net . - What do you mean , " got loose " ? He let it loose so it could evolve in its natural environment . - Urschleimin silicon . - Urschleimin silicon ? The primordial slime . The ooze out of which all life evolved . Except this time , it 's artificial slime , artificial life . One man alone achieving the equivalent of Copernicus , Magellan and Darwin . What was your role in all this ? Were you the bass player ? Autometa theory , M.I.T , ' 95 . Postdoc , the Santa Fe institute . Headhunted to Kobayashi my junior year . Then Donald showed up in Tokyo and made me a better offer . - A better offer to do what ? - You wouldn 't understand . You believe this load of crap ? You saw what happened back there , Scully . You saw that container blow . She could 've rigged an explosive charge . There are no weapons platforms . There is no such department of defense satellite . What about star wars ? Brilliant pebbles ? They were never built ! We don 't even have that kind of technology . Even if an artificial intelligence was targeting us with an armed satellite , - Why isn 't it doing it now ? - Because it doesn 't know where we are . If I so much as made a phone call right now , it would nuke us where we 're standing . - How ? - It recognizes my voice , monitors all communication . I haven 't used a phone in over a month . Then how did it know to target the container ? All I can think is some idiot got on Donald 's computer ... And tried to contact me over the net . Only Donald knew where I was . And David . - Who 's David ? - David Markham . He was hardware . Donald and I were software . We 'd been caring for the A.I. Weaning it . Then Donald warned us the system started to display more than consciousness . It started to display intention , but before we could stop it , it was gone . - Where ? - I don 't know . One day David was on the system , and it wouldn 't come when we called it . We knew it was out there somewhere on the global net , but it wouldn 't answer . - And Donald was just getting sicker . - And you can 't find it ? Well , it 's not a program anymore . It 's wildlife loose on the net . And either we kill it- - - Where 's Donald ? - Donald Gelman is dead . He was killed in a cafe in what looks like a hit . That 's the A.I. Protecting itself . It 'll find David and me . It 's only a matter of time . Donald was writing a concatenation of viruses ... Designed to find and immobilize the rogue system . The file name was " kill switch . " Without it , nobody can catch it . - We have Donald 's computer . - No , he 'd never leave it on the hard drive . Well , we have this . " Twilight time . " That 's it . That 's the kill switch . It can 't be . It is . Esther Nairn . You programmed the autonomous bots in ninjitsu princess , The most gnarliest piece of entertainment software ever . Are these the brain donors that nearly got us incinerated ? [ Mulder ] don 't let their looks fool you . Your name is Esther Nairn ? - She is so hot . - You gonna take off these cuffs , Or do I have to do this with my tongue ? You don 't want to take a vote . [ Sighs ] Gimme the kill switch . [ Scully ] aren 't you worried it 's gonna track you , Esther ? Hunt you down with another particle beam ? Not unless somebody else makes another boneheaded internet connection . [ Beeping ] - What is this ? - It 's the sharp end of a stick . Donald probably tried to feed this sector in over the net , But it took too long , so the system was able to take countermeasures . Why didn 't it just zap him too ? Its creator ? No , it needed to impress Donald . Particle beam would have been overkill . - Unlike a dozen crack dealers . - No . You see , that 's its sense of humor . [ Keyboard clacking ] huh . All right , but if you load the kill switch , What 's to stop it from playing another funny joke on us ? Obviously , we can 't inject kill switch over the net . There 's only one way now . We have to find its home node and feed it the poisoned apple . Physically ? Right into its eager little CD drive . It knew it couldn 't hide over the net forever- - Not until it learned to completely disguise itself . It requires a physical nexus of hardware , so somewhere , it 's built itself a safe house . - David went looking for it . - Did he find it ? - There 's no way to know . - Why don 't you just call him ? Oh , right . Death from above . - It would need bandwidth . - It 's a pig for bandwidth . - It 'd need a T3 at least . - T3 ? A hard line . Forty-Five megs a second . Major research labs and internet service providers use ' em . But the government keeps those records secret for fear of sabotage . Gee . You guys know anyone that works for the government ? [ Buzzing , crackling ] [ Snoring ] Buenas dias , muchacha . [ Cell phone beeps ] - Scully ? - Yep . I found something down in Fairfax county- - A derelict chicken farm with a t3 connection ... Paid for by Elaf industries , Palo Alto , Which there 's no other record anywhere . Dandy . Where are you ? Sounds like you 're driving . You are correct , sir . You have Esther with you ? - In a manner of speaking . - Left up here . - Give me that . - [ Mulder ] where are you going ? [ Low voice ] to find David . Where ? Scully ? Scully ? Go ahead . Put me out of my misery . Take it ! [ Alarm whooping ] [ Distorted ] F.B.I. I 'm a federal agent . [ Beeping ] [ Buzzing ] I lied to you . I wasn 't working with Donald . I mean , I was , and then he found out about us . About you and who ? David . About our plans . What plans did he find out ? Uploading . Transfer of memory , Of consciousness , To the distributed system maintained by the A.I. Imagine being mingled so completely with another ... You no longer need your physical self . You 're one . So you were going to- - Enter the A.I. Give up our inefficient bodies ... So that our consciousness can live together forever . But Donald Gelman forbade it . He was afraid of his creation . He was afraid of what would happen if other people followed us . I loved him so much . Well , maybe he wasn 't here when this happened . Maybe he 's somewhere else . David Markham . [ Electricity crackling ] [ shouting ] [ Siren wailing ] what 's going on ? Injuries to upper extremities . We got ourselves a real crispy critter here . Alert the burn unit . Tell them to scramble the surgical team . - Unit 23 . Request burn unit . - He 's comin ' up on us . Surgical team , stat ! What 's that smell ? Easy . Come on . Just-Just relax . [ Man ] one-twenty . B.P. , 130 over 80 . [ People chattering ] Right joint on contact side along path occurred at exit point . Looks like the charge grounded through both arms . Got a lot of work to do . Is it bad ? - You 're in good hands . - My arms hurt . That 's a good sign . Call- - Call my doctor . You have to call my doctor . Call Dr. Scully . Please call Dr. Scully . Call her . No . No ! No , what are you doing ? Prep the patient . No . No . No , no , no , no . - Aah ! - [ Saw whirring ] [ Phone beeping ] I can 't get through to Mulder . It 's the A.I. It 's had time to analyze my voice . It knows I was using your phone . It can interfere with my phone ? Give it enough information , it 'll sue you for palimony . Wait a minute . Mulder said that he found the system ... In an abandoned chicken farm in Fairfax county . Then maybe we can cut off the t3 and kill its communication capabilities . - You can do that ? - There 's only one way to find out . - [ Sighs ] - [ Internet connection warbling ] I feel sick . That 's the anesthetic , agent Mulder . You were injured , and they had to operate . I remember wires and , uh- - Yes , you were doing something dangerous . Something very , very foolish . The good news is , they were able to save the right one . What do you mean ? Oh , my God . What did you do with my arm ? What did they do with my arm ? Shh . Or they 'll come back . Come back for what ? They 're evil , Fox . But- - They want something from you . What do they want ? I don 't know , but if you don 't tell them , I 'm afraid they 'll take your other arm . This is crazy ! Y-You have to help me ! You have to get me out of here . Please . Help me . Help me . Please help me . Shh . They 'll hear you . [ Muffled shouting ] [ Shouting continues ] - [ Alarm sounds ] - [ Bells ringing ] [ Computer beeps ] something 's wrong . I didn 't do anything . I didn 't even get on the net . - I think it found us . - [ Brakes hiss ] [ Computer beeping ] it 's zeroing in . Esther ? Get away from the tanker truck ! Sir , you need to get out of the truck . Move it ! It 's gonna explode ! Dump it , Esther ! - Get rid of it ! - It 's got the kill switch ! Esther ! Dump it ! [ Beeping ] Esther ! Get rid of it ! - Get rid of it , Esther ! - [ Beeping ] Oh , I had this terrible dream . And then I had a good dream . Those weren 't dreams , Fox . I believe that 's enough for now . You poor thing . But I warned you . Nurse Nancy warned you . You have to tell them , Fox . You have to . - Tell them what ? - About the kill switch . - Nobody asked me anything . - You 've just forgotten , Fox . - No . - I was there . The doctor asked , and he was very cross when you refused to answer . But he 'll be here in just a few minutes , and you can tell him then . I- - I- - Otherwise- - Whoops ! There go your legs . [ Screaming ] - Freeze ! F.B.I. ! - Scully ! Mulder , they want the kill switch virus . What did you tell them ? I didn 't tell them anything . - I need to know ! - Look ! Do we have it ? Do we have the kill switch ? Of course we do . [ Murmuring ] Scully . Scully ? Scully , help ! Help ! Help ! Scully ! Here , kitty , kitty , kitty , kitty . [ Alarm whooping ] Scully . Mulder ? [ Scully , distorted ] all you all right ? I 'm in here . Scully . Mulder ? Mulder . Mulder , can you hear me ? Mulder ? Mulder ? Help me out here , Esther . What 's its next move ? What is it thinking ? I don 't know . Who built this ? It did . There . [ Gasps ] David ! Oh , God . Mulder ? Mulder ? Mulder , can you hear me ? - Mulder , talk to me . - [ Whirring ] He wants the kill switch . We don 't have it . You threw it in the water with the computer . - But that 's gonna kill it ? - Not if it can learn the program and vaccinate itself . [ Electrical charge pulses ] [ Electrical charge pulses ] - [ Crackling ] - Give it what it wants , Esther . - Put it in , Esther ! - [ Beeping ] It 's targeting us . Put it in ! ? [ " Twilight time " ] ? Heavenly shades of night are falling ? ? It 's twilight time ? You 're gonna be okay . I 'm gonna get you out of here . ? It 's twilight time ? ? ? When purple-Colored curtains - ? Mark the end of day ? - It 's okay . ? I 'll hear you , my dear at twilight time ? ? Doo-Doo ? ? Deepening shadows gather splendor ? ? As day is done ? ? Fingers of night will soon surrender ? ? The setting sun ? [ Scully ] what are you doing , Esther ? Get out of here . - What are you doing ? - Go ! [ Beeping ] ? At last at twilight time ? ? In the afterglow of day ? ? We keep our rendezvous ? ? Beneath the blue ? ? [ Continues ] Esther ? You don 't listen , do you ? - Where are you ? - Get out of here now ! ? Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me ? [ Beeping ] ? Like days of old ? ? Lighting the spark of love that fills me ? - ? With dreams untold ? - Upload . ? ? Each day I pray for evening ? ? Just to be with you ? ? Together at last at twilight time ? ? Together at last at twilight time ? [ Beeping ] Well , if Esther wanted to leave her body , she got her wish . At least that part of it . I wonder . Mulder , she 's dead . What if she managed to establish an uplink , Scully , a satellite transmission ? Mulder , are you telling me that you believe Esther may have- - That she may not be dead ? [ Mulder ] artificial life . It could exist . It could be here , among us , evolving . [ Scully ] electrons chasing each other through a circuit ? [ Beeping ] that isn 't life , Mulder . [ Mulder ] yeah , but what are we but impulses , Electrical and chemical , through a bag of meat and bones ? You 're the scientist . You tell me . Whoo ! You did it now , Harley ! You get it . Uh-Uh . They 'll get ya if you go in there . Mama says no one lives in there . [ Child ] I made this !

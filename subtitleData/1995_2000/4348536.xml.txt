 What about " Mitch " ? " Michael " ? " Mark " ? No . - " Melvin . " - Melvin ? I 'm glad we 've got a year or two before we make this decision . Now , does the name have to start with an " M " ? Yes . If it 's a girl , " Mary " or " Melissa . " Or how about " Mavis " or " Martina " ? No , wait , " Maybelline " ! Just like the song . I love it . Melvin , if it 's a boy Maybelline , if it 's a girl . Melvin and Maybelline and Liz Sumner . Perfect . Yeah , now if we could only agree on how many to invite to the wedding . Hey , are you okay ? - Hey , what 's wrong ? - My asthma , I think but I just had that shot . Kevin , I can 't breathe ... Liz ! Liz ! - How long ? - Oh , it 's impossible to predict . An asthmatic going into coma from an overdose of epinephrine is unusual , but it 's not unheard of . Hopefully , this will all pass in less than 24 hours . All we can do now is wait for her lungs to clear and let the stress in her entire system subside . - Can she hear me ? - Yes . Yes , I believe she can . You 'll have to excuse me , Mr. Sumner . I 'm due in surgery . Thanks . I 'll look back in on her as soon as I can . Hi . How are you ? Your son is still in a coma ... Liz I don 't know if you can hear me . But I just want you to know I love you more than anything in this world . What ? Quiet . Get down . Where are we ? Get out . Now . Before it 's too late ! I hunger . You cannot escape ! It tore him apart ! Somebody help that boy ! Doctor , come here ! Come on , come on , come on ! Miguel , over there . Quick , quick ! Do something . You have to do something ! Somebody help him ! - Somebody ! - Okay . Okay . Okay . No pulse , Doctor . Since the beginning oh time mankind has existed between the world oh light and the world oh darkness . Our secret society has been here horever protecting others hrom the creatures who inhabit the shadows and the night . Known only to the initiated by our true name The Legacy . Voila . Now , this should make our French brethren very happy . Directly , in person to Lucien Bretonne , head of Paris House . When you get there , speak to no one not even other members of the House . Lucien was very specific . Okay . I 'll call you from Paris . - Be careful . - I will . Paris , nice . Sounds like a milk run . - Need some company ? - Sorry . I 'm on my own for this one . - See you later . - Right . Nick , you had a message . A Kevin Sumner called . He said his fiancée wanted to talk to you . Liz Barrow . - Liz ? - She 's been admitted to St. Alban 's Hospital . Sounds serious . Kevin ? Nick . Thanks for calling . Trust me , it wasn 't my idea . How 's she doing ? She 's better . She 's sleeping now . I can 't believe this all started from an asthma attack . She 's had it since she was a kid . Well , right after they brought her up from the ER , she went into a coma . - A coma ? - Scared the hell out of me . But then , when she came to , she ... She started raving like a madwoman about a boy being torn apart . Then , of course , she starts asking for you . Sorry , if my being here bothers you . Damn right it bothers me . Maybe I should come back at another time . Nick . Hey , Lizzie . It 's been so long . - How are you ? - Okay . More importantly , how are you doing ? I 'd be a lot better if I could just get out of here . - Did Kevin tell you what happened ? - Yeah , briefly . I remember you telling me once about how you work with some pretty strange stuff , and ... I swear , Nick , it can 't be any stranger than this . Hey , later . Later , okay ? Nick . Yeah , yeah . Definitely . I 'll come back a little later . In the meantime , if there 's anything you guys need , just give me a shout . Supposedly , we have the best doctors in town looking after her . Although , after what she 's been through I 'm not so sure . Well , I have a friend of mine who 's a doctor . A psychiatrist , actually . Maybe she could help . You think I 'm crazy too . - Kevin does . - Hey , hey . No , I don 't . Come on , now . - No , I don 't . - Why don 't I bring my friend by when I come back ? A second opinion couldn 't hurt , right ? Okay . See you . Excuse me . No smoking . The patients . - So where do you want me to ... ? - Here . Talk about weird . Where 'd that guy come from ? He 's as bizarre as everything else around here . Yeah , well , at least Liz isn 't in a coma . Be thankful for that . Yeah , I guess you 're right . - Rachel , Kevin . Kevin , Rachel . - Hi . Hi . So why don 't we go talk to your friend , see how she 's doing , huh ? Hey , Liz . This is Rachel Corrigan , the psychiatrist I told you about . Hi , Liz . How are you feeling ? All right . Except , I can 't stop thinking about what happened . Well , that 's what Nick said . Can you tell me what you actually remember ? It wasn 't at all like a dream . I mean , it was so real . You think I 'm out of my mind . Not any more than the rest of us . Hey , Dr. Corrigan 's here to help . You just tell her what you told me . At first it was just pitch black . And then I could feel myself being pulled deeper and deeper into the darkness . What was pulling you ? Some force . Some ... Something . I don 't know . But the next thing I knew , I was in this strange place , and there were ... Well , everything was twisted and grey , and then that 's when I saw the little boy . Can you tell me what the little boy looked like ? He was blond . The same boy I saw when I came out of the coma right over there . The one who died . You see , he was ... He was hiding from something . And then there was this terrible noise , like ... Like a hungry beast . And then he started to run , but ... This thing ... This ... This ... This big dark , shadow , it came over him . You 're safe . I 'm right here , talk to me . - It killed him , in cold blood . - All right , Liz I want you to take a deep breath . Take a deep breath for me . I 'm not crazy , I swear . This wasn 't my imagination . This place is real . I know . I believe you . There you go . There you go . Okay . There 's a good girl . We have to consider the possibility that her visions were completely delusional . What 's that , psychobabble for " crazy " ? Nick , I didn 't say that . Okay , " delusional " then . Except for that boy dying in the next bed at the exact moment that Liz came out of her coma . She could have seen him in the ER or in the hallway before she went into her coma , creating a subconscious impression which explains his appearance in her nightmare . However , coincidences like these shouldn 't be completely ignored . Any other links between Liz and the boy ? Yeah , yeah . For starters , they had the same emergency room team , same ward , and after they went into coma they had the same neurosurgeon , a Dr. Patterson . And the same supervising physician , a Dr. Brendan Slade . World-class surgeon . Perhaps these gentlemen won 't mind answering a few questions . Luna Foundation . Well , this is quite a privilege . Your generosity is well known in the medical community . And your reputation precedes you , too , doctor . When I was a student , I attended a series of lectures you gave on the treatment of children with a vascular necrosis . - Excellent . - Well , don 't stop now . I 'm not a man to discourage adulation . Or funding , for that matter . We could always use a new name on a wing . - Please , sit down . - Thanks . Actually , we 're here on behalf of a patient at the hospital . Elizabeth Barrow . Miss Barrow . Yes , we 're quite pleased with her progress . Well , if it 's possible , we 'd like to speak to her neurosurgeon in charge of her case , Dr. Patterson . Yes , I don 't have a problem with that . He 's a good man . Liz is certainly recovering quite nicely under his care . Even though she has an overwhelming fear of becoming comatose again ? I 'm sorry , what are you talking about ? You weren 't informed of the vision she experienced while in her coma ? How she saw the boy , in the bed next to her , killed ? No , I was not . This is the first I 've heard about it . Perhaps she talked to Dr. Patterson about it . - We 'll ask him . - Yeah , please do . Sorry . I 'm afraid you caught me in a bit of a rush . We won 't take much of your time , Dr. Patterson . We just have ... No , no . No problem . No problem . I 'm just sorry I don 't have much time to give you . I 've got a pre-op in 10 minutes . - This is about Liz Barrow , correct ? - Yes . An epinephrine overdose leading to swelling of the cranial hemisphere . Transient ischemic coma and , hopefully a quick and permanent recovery . Is there anything else ? Yeah . I have a question about the Sanford boy . How did a routine appendectomy leave him in a coma ? A coma he never came out of while under your care ? Dr. Patterson , we certainly don 't mean to imply that you had ... No , no , no . It 's all right . It 's all right . What happened to that boy is a source of complete frustration to me . I honestly can 't tell you what caused his coma , or his death . Now , excuse me , I have some work to do . Thanks . What the hell do you think you were doing in there ? Long time no see . You stopped just short of accusing him of malpractice . If I did , maybe we 'd get answers rather than the runaround . What are you talking about ? Patterson is a top neurosurgeon and Slade is the most respected surgical man . That 's no reason to treat him like the next Albert Schweitzer . - You doctors always stick together ? - Okay I 'm gonna pretend I didn 't hear that . Something bad is going on in this hospital . Open your eyes and see it . I 'll tell you what I see . I see somebody who 's so emotionally involved that he 's blinding himself to reality . Are you saying she 's incompetent ? No . I 'm saying she may have serious emotional problems . If you 're not willing to face that possibility , I 'm out of here . Okay . Well , single moms are mad , and they 're highting back . Today we 're talking about Single Moms United . It 's a new coalition dedicated to the hormation oh legislation hor ... Hi . Hi , yourself . - How you doing ? - Better . Nothing like catching up on talk shows to make you want to get out of the hospital . Right . You ever notice how most people never say what they really mean ? All the time . Kind of sounds like us , huh ? You figure ? Yeah . So Kevin seems like a good guy . Now who isn 't saying what they mean ? What do you want me to say , Liz ? I haven 't got the words . I know . It 's just a shame , that 's all . Bad timing . Terrible . But things are good , really . Kevin is wonderful , and we have so much in common . He teaches at the same school as me . We 're both nuts about kids . The only thing we can 't agree on is how many to have and what their names should be . That is , if I ever get out of here . So , what does your friend say ? Am I crazy ? You 're a little warped , but you 'll be okay . You 're such a creep . No , you 'll get out of here . Count on it . I was gonna go to the cafeteria and choke down a little bit of food . I 'll come back and check on you before I go . Nick I 'm glad you came . Me too . I 'm very sorry , visiting hours are over . No exceptions . Come on . It 's , like , five minutes after 9 . Give me a break . Rules are rules , my friend . You don 't wanna get me fired , do you ? - Come on , cut him some slack . - No . Liz ! - Hold her . - I get a doctor . Put the mask on . Oh , God . Liz . She 's gone into a coma . - Yes ? - Derek , it 's me . Alex , how 's it going ? Have you delivered the briehcase to Lucien ? Just a second , okay ? Listen , that 's why I called . I went to the Paris House , but no sign oh Lucien , until now . - Did you speak to him ? - No , but he leht a note . He wants me to meet him before dawn at the base of the steps of 23 Rue de Rivoli . You have to be carehul . If Bretonne fails to show , or you feel endangered ... Alex ? - Hey . - Hey . Sorry about before . I was a little bit frustrated with the situation . Forget it . We 've all been there . I 'm sorry , she 's not responding . - She 's slipped back . - No , I 'm not gonna accept this . - Take it easy . - You 're a doctor . You 're supposed to be able to do something here . We 've done everything possible for her , and will continue to do so . Some things are just beyond our control . - This isn 't fair . - No , it 's not fair . It 's life . Look , why don 't you step outside and get some air . I 'll take care of her for a while . Yeah . Yeah , I guess you 're right . - What ? - Look . Okay , this substance that Nick found on Liz 's neck is a variant on scopolamine , a substance extracted from the barracera plant of the nightshade family . - Deadly nightshade . - Exactly . Used by shamans in Central and South America . It causes loss of will and memory for days . Only this is much more highly concentrated . It was probably absorbed through the skin . - Enough to induce coma ? - At the very least . That 's enough for me . Where are you going ? To the hospital to get another look at that mark . Wait for me . Look , I was going through this book . This is what we 're looking for . It 's similar but not quite the same . Maybe the skin 's stretched . Let me try this . - That 's it . - Yeah , it 's Aztec and demonic . - Oh , man . I 'm having a really hard time believing somebody 's actually practicing black magic in the city hospital . Can we , at least , pursue the possibility of some more rational explanation ? Give me one . Right . So it 's up to us . - Nick , you know what to do . - Right . What about causes of death ? In every case , it coincides with whatever the patient was being treated for . - So there 's no connection . - Except in 21 cases . The patient 's illness was so routine that their slipping into a coma was listed as an unexplainable side effect . Twenty-one cases ? Who are the attending physicians ? There 's no kind of pattern there . They 're all different . So we 're right back where we started . Who says it has to be a doctor ? What about Miguel Sanchez ? He 's an orderly on Liz 's floor . And he 's been on duty every time that somebody has died . Born and raised in Mexico City . What do you want to bet he 's got Aztec blood in his veins . Okay , tell you what , I 'm gonna call an old friend of mine . He 's a cardiovascular surgeon . Goes way back over there . See if he wants to have dinner . Fill in some gaps . You wanna come ? So , Bill , when you said you 'd join me for dinner I guess I should have known we 're talking doctor 's hours , huh ? Well , next time , we 'll have to dine some place more elegant . But I must admit , I 've developed a certain fondness for meatloaf over the years . Anyway , I knew you haven 't got much time so I 'll cut right to the chase . I just wanted to pick your brain a little bit about some some people who work here . A friend of a friend of mine is a patient , and I just ... Say no more . Say no more . You wanna feel out the turf and make sure you get the best care possible . - Absolutely . Great . Just great . What about Dr. Slade ? Oh , Bren ? Bren and I go way back . We did our residency together . Play golf together . Drink together . Even travel together , once in a while , since my divorce . We 've been to Paris London , Mazatlán . - Mazatlán ? - I didn 't think much of it myself but I didn 't get to see much . - Why not ? Supposed to be there a week , had to come back after two days . Had an emergency . Bren liked it well enough , though , I can tell you . He was really depressed when he went down there . Was feeling great when he came back . Been down a couple of times since . You remember the last time he went down there ? About a year ago . He hooked up with this local medicine man down there . I thought he was setting up a tax dodge , write off all the trips and that sort of thing . He was looking for a cure for his arthritis . Slade has arthritis ? " Had . " He thought it was irreversible . It usually is . And career-ending news for a surgeon . Yeah , no question . Whatever Bren found down there in the jungle power of positive thinking , mud wraps never gave me the details . Worked like a damn charm . - He 's fine now , as far as I can tell . - Really . Lucky man . No ! No . Alex , how did it go ? Not good at all . Bretonne 's dead . What ? - How ? - Something is very wrong here . Listen , I 'll explain when I get back . I 've gotta get out of here . Yes , of course . Alex , be safe . Derek , I found our man . It 's Slade . Slade ? Are you sure ? You betcha . He had rheumatoid arthritis until he went to Mexico and found a shaman to restore his hands . Now he 's a hundred percent . He 's perfect enough to do surgery . That 's not the way arthritis works . What 's this ? - " Quihatzin . The hungry one . " - Believed by the Aztecs to be the gatekeeper of Talocan , shadow world between life and death . " A demon who seduces anyone who 's willing to trade innocent victims for worldly gain . He slowly feeds off their souls until nothing remains . " The hospital . You were never one to make things easy , were you ? I 'm finally ready to talk , and you can 't hear me . Turnabout 's fair play , right ? I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry that I never treated you the way you deserved to be treated . That 'll be all . Little late for rounds , isn 't it , doctor ? Busy man like you , how do you find the time ? What are you doing here , Mr. Boyle ? Visiting hours are over . What 's that you got there , new treatment ? Yes , that 's right . I suggest you leave before I call security . Why don 't you do that . Then we can all sit down and talk about what you got in your hand . Then you tell us about the patients you 've killed . What are you talking about ? What kind of a dark deal have you made here ? What did you get in return for the lives of your patients ? I got my life and my hands . I was on the brink of killing myself in Mexico . - This opportunity arose . - Opportunity ? For what ? Eternal bondage ? Your demon 's never satisfied , is he ? They never are . No . You 're right about that . Say hello to Liz for me . I hope you 'll be very happy together . Till death do you part . - Slade ! - Care to join him ? He 's alive , Derek , barely . But he 's way under . Hypnosis . Nick , stay strong . The demon will do everything it can to mislead you . But it 's powerless to attack unless you surrender to its will . Listen for me . Let 's do it . Derek , it 's 11 : 15 . I 'm giving you five minutes , maximum . Considering where you 're going , that 's all you get . Then I 'm bringing you back . Understand ? - Yeah . - Okay . Concentrate on this image . Total focus . Visualize it as you enter the void . Close your eyes . Relax . And let your breath take you deeper and deeper . Prodigal lover returns . Liz . Oh , how I 've missed you . Where are we ? Anywhere we want to be . As long as we 're together till the end of time . Remember that night we spent in San Francisco that penthouse on the bay ? You took me there for my birthday . Blindfolded . Just think of all the things we could do . - This isn 't real . - It is , if we try . We could be happy again , just like before . I want you , Nick . All you have to do is come take me now . - Liz , listen to me . - No . You listen to me . You could erase all this pain . All those days and nights I spent waiting for you after you 'd left me . I remember . - I wanted to marry you . - I know . I was afraid . Of what ? Of ruining everything I touched . Like my father . You 're not your father , Nick . I love you . Come touch me . Come to me , Nick . Feel me . Come to me , Nick . Come to me on your own . Come to you ? - Why ? - Because I need you . Why won 't you touch me ? Why won 't you reach out and hold me ? You can 't control me . Unless I surrender to your will . Can you , Liz ? Thief ! You dare enter my world unbidden to steal what is mine . - Liz ! Where are you ? Come , thief , take her if you can . But if you fail , you 're mine forever . Derek , listen to me , I 'm gonna have to pull you out . Liz ? Make your choice , or she shall die . Save me . No , save yourself . Derek , listen to me . Listen to my voice . On the count of three , you will regain consciousness . One , two ... Save me . No , save yourself . Hurry , do it now ! - We gotta go . - I can 't . - Leave me ! - Come on , you can do it . Quickly , this way ! - Come on ! - I 'm trying ! Hang on . Nick , you must be stronger ! Do it now ! Derek ! - Leave me ! Save yourself . - I won 't let you go . Derek ! Nick , this way ! Hurry ! Hurry ! Nick ? - You 're back . - How did you manage that ? It was a team effort . Thanks . Forget it . - You okay ? - Yeah . You all right ? Hey . Hey . Oh , God . Thank you .

 Hello ? Yes . I understand . Right . I won 't fail . Durango ! - It even sounds like me . - What 's a Durango ? Oh , some place in New Mexico . But , I mean , this thing 's got boldness , character . Oh , it 's hot . Forty-eight valves , 12 cylinders . There 's nothing wrong with the car you 've got . It 's five years old , George . Eighty thou on the clock . The thrill is - is gone . Look at this . I mean , check it out . Check it out . You 've gotta - You 're not even looking . Look - Check out this body . Fifteen on the highway , 12 in the city , Matt . Oh , great . Mr. I 'll Build My House With Bricks . Oh , that 's the little pig that the big bad fox didn 't get . That 's wolf , George . Big bad wolf . And you don 't even know what a car is . You don 't understand - A car is a statement . A car - - Is that a tail ? - Oh . We really need a better blender . Durango ! But it 's not a race thing . It 's not an ex-cop thing . Paul Bearer 's simply the best choice for senator , Detective . He 's a good D. A. , I 'll give you that . And Silverthorne is a promise-breaker a server of special interests , - ... tobacco lobbyists - - Tobacco lobbyists ? According to them , matches have been causing lung cancer all along . - An Armani , right ? - If the suit 's handpicked - Then you gotta convict . Uniform coming in with some threads for Carter 's court appearance . How 's it going ? - How you doing ? - Fine . Nice to see you again . Very nice . Look what we have here . What do you say , Carter ? Hey , I 'm the one that 's doing you guys a favor , all right ? He 's very grateful . ALIEN NATION - " THE UDARA LEGACY " Subtitles subXpacio California 's Mojave Desert , nine years ago . Our historic first view of the Newcomers ' ship . Theirs was a slave ship carrying a quarter of a million beings ... bred to adapt and labor in any environment . Physically stronger than human beings with keener senses and two hearts ... these alien Newcomers have joined the American workforce . The Tenctonese have been accepted by many , but feared and hated ... by so-called human purists ... now incensed by the Newcomers ' right to vote and run for public office . With no way to leave Earth , the Tenctonese Newcomers ... have become a growing part of the population of Los Angeles . Oh , Matt . I 'm almost ready to go in . They called . Your star witness against Moran just got hit . - Two cops are dead . - Well , that 's impossible . - How could they have found out - - George , it was another cop . - It was Tina . - But that doesn 't make any sense . - She 's a model officer . - Was . She shot it out with them right at the safe house . Moran got to her , George . I know how disappointed you guys are . I 'm out of here . Case dismissed . Without Carter , you got nothin ' . George - George , don 't ! This won 't help . Let him go . He 'll be back . And as you can imagine , my hearts go out to the officers and their families . The criminal justice system will get back on its feet . These slain servants of that system will not . Mr. Bearer , do you think this shooting might hurt your election chances ? Because I 'm a former police officer ? Because I 'm the district attorney ? - No , not exactly . - Because the apparent killer was a Newcomer ? Are you going to ask Senator Silverthorne if he 's concerned ... that human police corruption in the Riviera Heights narcotics case ... or civil rights violations by human officers in the Bradley case ... are going to hurt his chances to widen the gap ? The truth is , malfeasance by any sworn officer is bad ... whether they be Newcomer or human . This is not a partisan issue . This is not a specie-al issue . This is a tragic loss of life . - Pretty slick . - No . Just honest . Mr. Bearer , one more question before you go . There he goes . George . - My partner , Matthew Sikes . - Hi . - Paul Bearer . - How do you do ? - You handled that pretty well . - You think so ? Thanks . But there 's more than one truth here . This will compromise my chances . Forget logic and facts . Newcomers are judged by harsher standards . George , Moran knows you 'll try and tie him to the hit . It won 't be easy , but don 't disappoint him , old friend . That 's a promise . Uh , Detective , how about your vote ? Well , I-I feel - Matt operates on the theory that no matter who you vote for , the government always gets you . Hey , I vote . Miss Microbrewery ? 1993 , wasn 't it ? Yes , I remember that rather unique calendar . There were some issues involved . - Why do you do that ? It 's embarrassing . - What ? I didn 't do anything . Nicolas Carter was gunned down just before leaving ... to testify against Moran on " murder for hire " charges . While details are still sketchy , sources have told KNRG News ... that the assassin was a Newcomer policewoman . Authorities have only confirmed that two detectives guarding Carter are also dead . As soon as the news reached the courtroom ... Moran 's legal team asked for a dismissal of all charges . Hello ? Shyster . I was wondering when you 'd call . So did you like my little demonstration ? No , no , no , no , no . That 's my edge . But I guess you could say it wins the " Good Felony Seal of Approval , " huh ? Yeah , I bet you would . So can we do business ? No , no , no , counselor . You name a price . Then we 'll start from there . 24,000 ? You 're kidding , right ? No , no , no . The convertible , loaded . - This is a tragic loss of life . - You 'll work with me ? Work with this . What are you doing ? Hey , I 'm trying to work a deal here . Cathy , these people , they act as if they 're doing me a favor . " Due to the demand , we don 't discount . " What a crock ! - I was watching Bearer on the news . - It 's okay . I was there . That was it . He didn 't take any more questions . - Give me the remote . - No , no , no , no - Hey , why don 't we go check out the ride on the new Durango ? You don 't need a new ride . And I was watching the news . Cathy , this is important to me . All right . Fine . As long as we have separate accounts ... you may spend your money as foolishly as you wish . Ah ! You didn 't have to - Your little masculine control thing , it 's not attractive . I think you damaged some nerves . I may never drive again . Oh . Ah . Oh , yeah . Oh , that 's good . He 's a nice guy , but I don 't think he 's gonna make it . - How about a little lower ? - Oh , I hope you 're wrong . We won 't always be such a minority , you know , and almost all of us vote . How about a lot lower ? You 're doing it again . Oh , just think of it as a masculine move thing . And this has nothing to do with me watching the news ? You want some news ? I got a hot flash for you right here . Oh . Hello ? George , hi . Matt 's right here . Ah . The dead policewoman . Sure . The coroner 's office , 10 : 00 ? Oh ! Yes , George . Fine , fine . Good night ! I 'll be in the bedroom with the news . Matt was humming . Well , I 'm glad those classes didn 't go to waste . A little early . Well , we 've been together a lot longer , George ... but I do remember when you used to hum any time of the day . You know , I think Paul Bearer 's right . Anything negative about Newcomers so close to the elections ... will really hurt his chances . - Emily 's still studying at the library ? - Supposed to be . Did you hear that some of his people are worried that if he 's elected ... he 'll try too hard to be impartial ? That Newcomers might actually be shortchanged ? - Where 's Buck , I wonder ? - I don 't know . He 's being strange again . Oh , that feels good . George ! Just trying to remember what they look like . It wasn 't a criticism , nemul . Such beautiful spots . I thought you had to - Mm-hmm ! Oh , um , maybe we 'll go out later , huh ? Or maybe we 'll order in . We got some leftovers . Mom ! Dad ! Hey , you guys ! Oh , man . I have got something really great to tell you . Maybe now 's not a good time . - I 'm sorry . - Buck , didn 't you see me waving to you on Seventh Street ? Uh , your mother had something in her eye . Oh , yeah . You 've had this problem with your eye before , haven 't you , Mom ? Why don 't we all go out to dinner ? It looks like you both would prefer room service . No , no , dinner 's good . We should definitely celebrate ... - ... after you hear this . - What is it , Son ? It 's a job . It is a new job . Buck , if we celebrated every new job - - Emily . - No , it 's okay . I 've bounced around for a long time . I never knew what I wanted to do until now . You 've found something you 're interested in . - Buck - Buck , that 's wonderful . - And it was always right in front of me . I will be able to help people . I won 't lose my Tenctonese identity . - And I have you to thank especially , Dad . - Me ? - Yeah . - Buck , you didn 't . - He hasn 't told us yet . - Yes , he has , George . I 've been accepted to the police academy . I start tomorrow . Whoo-hoo-hoo ! My brother , the cop ? You know , you won 't exactly be making the big bucks . A person 's worth is not always measured in coin of the " helm , " Emily . Yeah . And that 's " realm , " Dad . And you didn 't think of discussing it with us first ? - No . - Susan , what 's the matter with you ? I 've spent a lot of years being a policeman 's wife , George . You know the first rule ? I don 't tell you I 'm afraid . If something happened , how would they tell me ? Would somebody show up at my office ? Would they just call ? Can I get to the hospital fast enough ? How do I tell the kids if - I 'm very proud of you , George , of the work you do , but enough . It 's - It 's enough . I don 't want to be a policeman 's mother too . I don 't . Hel - Hello ? - Mr. Guini ? - Who is this ? - Are you ready for a mission ? - Yes . Mom , look . I want - You want me to stop by the market after school ? No . Buck can do a big shopping over the weekend . You 're gonna worry no matter what I say . I can 't help that . I understand . It 's just I feel so positive about this , Mom . Yeah , I 'm sure you do . And I always knew eventually you 'd find something you were passionate about . I just - I just didn 't expect this , all right ? Why not ? I 've watched Dad for all these years . You know , until last night , I had never told your father how much his job bothers me . He 's so committed to what he does , I never wanted to burden him . But now I 'm worried that because of what I said , he might just - - Wimp out ? - No ! No , but he might react more slowly ... or do something he wouldn 't normally do . - Why am I feeling so guilty ? - Why am I ? Why am I ? Well , I 'm late for school , and I don 't feel a bit guilty . Will you finish the dishes ? I 've gotta get to the office . I love your mother very much , and I love being a policeman . If I had to live without one or the other ... I would find it very difficult to choose . Your mother is a very brave woman ... not unlike anyone who loves someone who wears a badge . She 's doing what her hearts tell her - trying to protect you . Dad , are you hoping to turn me off of this ? I don 't think so . I do what I do ... because the law at its best promises order and fairness . It checks the tyranny of people who prey on others . When you 've lived in slavery , these things are not just words . You wanna know the main reason I wanna do this ? It 's seeing how much satisfaction you get and how good you are at it . Your mother will never make me choose . This will always be my burden . Yours too if this is what you want . Oh , yeah . And I promise , I 'll never embarrass you . That 's not a concern . You just do your job ... and , uh - and try to keep yourself safe . Now you sound like a cop 's father . I suppose I do . Oh ! Okay ! All right . You 'll learn that . Geez ! Yeah , I can see where Susan would be a little hinky over it , George . - Hinky ? - " Put out , " " less than happy . " - Oh . She 's hinky . - I 'm happy for Buck . - Maybe he finally found himself . - Oh , I hope so . You clued him in on the academy , I hope ? Affirmative action ? Quota-driven central ? Don 't you remember ? - Oh , I think it 's getting better . - Not what I hear . Only thing worse than being a woman or white - A Newcomer . A Newcomer with a detective sergeant father . Well , I didn 't pull any ropes . I didn 't even know . Strings , George . And it wouldn 't matter . What 's the matter , Roberts ? Worried about your fingernail polish ? - What 's she doing ? - A documentary . That 's what I heard . - Francisco ! - Yes , sir ? - Something you wanna share with us ? - No , sir ! - You think you can do better ? - I don 't know , sir . Up front , now ! Get down here , Roberts . Stronger , smarter , faster , right ? - Not necessarily , sir . - I beg your pardon ? We 're all trying to do our best , sir . Is that so ? You got five seconds . Go ! One , two ... three , four , five , six ... seven , eight , nine ... 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 ... 16 , 17 . You got a long way to go , mister . - Yes , sir . - Get back in line . Six wounds . Three high-velocity . According to the two survivors , she was the damn Energizer bunny . Here and here , these two wounds ... almost instantaneously fatal . The shockwave tissue damage , the bone damage , the nerve damage - The M. E. thought I might have some idea ... but I can 't explain what kept her going . - Drug screen ? - That was my first thought . But there are no preliminary indications . I 'll have toxicology back in a few days though . Maybe her two hearts kept her going . Both damaged in near arrest . Then she had to be high . Makes no sense . Clean record , no debts , no unexplained assets . It 's Moran . He got to her somehow . Someone certainly did . George , code three . As you can see , complete chaos has broken out at Hesiod University . Get the yellow tape over here . Hesiod University . Is that a religious deal ? No , no . Hesiod was Greek . Age of Homer . One of the earliest didactic poets . Oh , well , that explains it . His work was meant to be educative , not entertaining . Will you quit ? Look what they send us ! Why can 't we get a real cop ? - I hope he 's not in charge . - That 's enough . Come on . Not a lot of educating going on here . - Other cheek , Matthew . - Yeah , I 'll give ' em both cheeks . - Ball get stuck in the hoop again , Wilcox ? - Very funny , Sikes . We 've got a bomber sitting with the girls ' varsity volleyball team . He 's got about 50 sticks of what looks like commercial grade dynamite strapped to him . Can we get a shot ? No snipers . He 's holding a triggering device . - Hard wire or remote ? - It 's remote . We 've already got some jammers set up on the roof . We 're setting the antennas up now , but you know how many frequencies there are . Uh , George , I know it 's my turn as hostage negotiator ... - but you might wanna take this one . - Faldo . Loosely translated , we 're up to our ears in faldo . - What does he want ? - Must have an accomplice ... 'cause the parents of the kids on the team are getting calls ... to wire transfer big bucks to some bank , or else this guy will level the gym . - Are they paying ? - Haven 't heard , but I wouldn 't be surprised . What ? Matt , the bomber - how does he know this is working ? I don 't see a phone , a pager . Nothing . - Stay away . - I 'd like to . But they 've asked me to tell you that the money has been transferred , that - Stop right there ! How are we doing ? We 've got AM / FM and the medium wave bands covered . Shortwave , uh , single side bands ? We 're working on it , but we 're not Voice of America . - Wilcox , talk to me . - He 's 15 feet away . Stalemate . You seem very calm . That 's good . There 's no reason anyone should get hurt . This is almost over . Come on . Let 's move ! Look , I need you to hit all ham radio bands , both civil and commercial air . Let 's get that antenna in here , please . Come on . Let 's move ! They 're talking . Francisco 's still 12 feet away . - Let 's shoot hi m . - I don 't know . It 's going to be very difficult for you to get out . Your partner has - has the money . I 'll go out with you . We 'll - We 'll walk right out . It 's not the money , is it ? You don 't know what 's happening . You don 't even care , do you ? I 'm talking to you ! It 's going down ! We are cooking from " A " to " Z. " We 're jamming all the frequencies I can think of . - Fire and police . - What , are you nuts ? Man , we need to - Do it ! All of it ! Now ! Take it off . Take it all off . Don 't do this . No ! Get down ! Get down ! Get out ! Hurry ! Udara . Move , move , move ! George ! George ! You all right ? George ? Oh , yes . - Hey , George , way to go . - That was a good job . You saved a lot of kids . Great work , George . Ooh , this looks like a nice cruise , Detective . This is five years of savings and all my sick leave , and I am so ready , Albert . Oh . " A world of cabaret , dance and romance awaits you . Everything you could possibly desire is on board . " - How about a nice , tall Norwegian officer ? - Oh , this is interesting . " Some passengers may want to fill out absentee ballots ... before embarking from their country of origin . " I just happen to have one right here . You know , this would have slipped my mind . I 'd like to , um ... encourage you to vote for - Done deal , Albert . I hope your Newcomer wins . - Hey , Matt . - Hey . - I got a little souvenir for you , partner . - Why don 't you give it to George ? - Guess what frequency it was on . - I don 't , uh - TAC three . I 'm telling you , if you hadn 't made that police band call ... we 'd still be coming down to Earth in pieces . You know , I 'm hearing talk about a commendation for Francisco . Maybe even a medal of valor . You believe that ? You got a problem with that ? Hey , let 's go grab a late lunch . I want to check out some other cars . Oh , forget it , George . We 've never had a case ... even remotely connected to that Udara myth . Udara 's not a myth . Udara means " freedom . " " Take my blood . We will be free . " That was their oath , their battle cry . The perp 's name is Leonard Guini . - Len Guini ? - No record , no criminal associates . Construction worker . Nothing in his background ... to account for killing a guard or attempted extortion . Sound familiar ? Tina ? Nothing to explain her actions either . George , Carter was a mob hit . And this Len Guini guy is just a loony somebody hired . This is everything the Bureau of Newcomer Affairs had on Udara . - It 's not very much , I 'm afraid . - Well , it was worth a try . Thank you , Albert . I thought the Udara were , like , your resistance force . - The good guys . - No , no . We had a recognized resistance group . The Udara were slaves who believed any means were justified ... against the Kleezantsun . Assassination , sabotage . We lost many innocent lives when the Overseers retaliated . Okay , so this Guini guy used to be Udara . He was on the right side , but an extremist . Tina would have been too young . We heard they recruited children as well . No one really knows . " Take my blood . We will be free . " It was also an oath to die when captured ... to reveal nothing of themselves to the enemy . George , in case you haven 't noticed , the only Overseers left on the planet ... have either gotten with the program , are doing hard time ... or have checked into the Boneyard Hilton . This is 60 feet , shallow draft ... eight staterooms , twin diesels . $ 300,000 . Anything else to show me ? What about that one there ? That 's , uh - 80 feet . It sleeps 12 . Transoceanic , all teak interior . A million and a half . Oh , yeah . That 's more like it . Let 's go aboard . Now , most of the craft in this range are all cash , Mr. Duncan . And your present boat won 't bring too much in its current condition . Oh , hell , burn it for all I care . And all cash won 't be a problem . See , my brother died , left me an inheritance . Oh , I 'm terribly sorry , Larry . My condolences . Forget it . He died years ago . But what that computer nerd left me - Well , it took a little while to realize its potential ... but , uh , I 'm in business now . So show me the , uh , galley of this ocean crosser . Let 's do it . - Matt , what are you doing ? - These guys got a new shipment of 993s . - But we 're supposed to meet Cathy . - Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . I called her . She 's gonna meet us here . - Well , what happened to the " Dungo " ? - Durango , George . And those guys didn 't want to bargain . It 's the art of the deal , George . Ooh ! It 's all part of the pleasure you get after the sale . - Hey , Cathy . - Hi . The human male never seems to progress past adolescence . Regarding Tina - I screened for everything , George ... a full workup , and there was no indication of usage or dependency . Everything was in the normal Newcomer range . - Oh , man ! - Did you hear about this morning ? After the fact . It 's better if I don 't know . Do you worry about him ? Man ! Impetuous little boy going after the bad guys ? - Of course . - Does he know ? Well , we don 't talk about it , George , but I think it 's a given . Uh , when can I see Mr. Guini ? He was acutely suicidal . He tried to bite his tongue off . I had to sedate him . How many cases have you heard of where a patient ... could bring him or herself to actually do that ? - Do what ? - Bite the tongue off . Bleed to death . Not that Udara thing again . Udara ? Leonard Guini 's words right before he tried to swallow that pill were , " Take my blood " - " We will be free . " He may have been Udara on the ship , George ... but that cause is long gone . Both Tina and Leonard , not a hint of a criminal background , no apparent motive . George , you ever hear the expression " There 's a price at which everything moves " ? Somebody offered these guys a number they couldn 't say no to . For a suicide mission ? I 'm gonna try and talk to Leonard . Right . Right after a little test drive . - Now ! - Okay . But if you want some real information , I 'm gonna go lean on Jake Moran . I 'm telling you , he got to Tina . He ordered that hit . Oh , mama ! - Cliff ! Guys ! - What happened to you ? - I can 't get my locker open . - It 's more of their games . - You 've gotta get changed . - No , I 'd rather be on time . - Mistake . Hurry . - Okay , thanks . Oh , God ! Look at that slag go . Oh , God ! - Oh , God ! - Duh ! We 're all just trying to do our best , sir . We 're all just trying to do our best , sir . Look , you gotta make copies of this . They 'll be standing in line for it . When you take the suspect into custody , it is your responsibility - Can we help you , Francisco ? - I 'm sorry , Officer . I had a - - He had a locker problem , sir . - Take your seat . - Thank you . And they 're off ! Pouson on the rail . This isn 't the race , boss . I 'm gonna mute it . - We 're closed till 5 : 00 . - Board of Health . I hear you got cockroaches . Oh , yeah , I see three of ' em now . Big ugly ones . Make it quick , Detective . Like the bookends , Jake . They housebroken ? Where do you find guys with no necks ? Or do you breed ' em ? It 's all right . Time 's up , Sikes . Unless you got a warrant - What I got is three dead cops . That 's a marker you 'll never lose , Jake . It 's gonna get so heavy , it 's gonna break your miserable back . I really wanted Carter popped , okay ? But the thing is , the hit didn 't come from me . You wanna insult me , provoke me , threaten me , do it . I understand where you 're coming from . You just ain 't gonna get the satisfaction ... 'cause I don 't know who , I don 't know how , and I don 't know why . End of story . - Hey , Mrs. F. Long time no see . - Gary . - How 's your daughter ? - She 's terrific , thank you . Great . Um , I 'm here to see George . You heard , huh ? Heard what ? Doesn 't matter . It 's old news , and everybody 's A-okay . - You 're sure ? - For real . Albert , is George okay ? He 's fine . He and Matt just went out . Let me see if they left a destination . It 's all right . We just needed to talk . I 'll , um - I 'll write him a note . - Are you sure ? - Yeah . Susan ? Are you okay ? Is George working on something to do with Udara ? Crazy , huh ? Two serious felonies . Both perpetrators were Newcomers . George thinks there may be some connection to Udara . Why would he think that ? " Take my blood . We will be free . " You don 't hear that very often . No , I - I guess you don 't . Do you want me to tell him anything ? Uh , it 's okay . Um , I 'll see him later . It 's safe now , Len . Just keep breathing . Your breathing is getting easier . Relax . Nothing can harm you . You want to relax . You 're safe here . Just forget about everything . Clear your mind . It 's so peaceful and quiet . This is the voice you trust . This is the voice that brings you peace and keeps you safe . Cathy ? Can you hear me , Len ? Yes , I hear you . Open your eyes . That 's right . Look at me . Do you trust this voice , Len ? Yes . I trust this voice . Do you work , Len ? Construction work . Shiny hammer . Oh , I work . - Do you like your job ? - Yes . What about money , Len ? Do you need more money ? Computer . I want a computer . Newcomer network . I could go online . I - I need - I need - What - What do you need , Len ? Tell me what you need . To talk to other Newcomers on the Web . Do they have the dream - the same dream ? I don 't understand . The same dream . Tell me about it , Len . Tell me about the dream . One of the mines . I carry away the dead . Some have taken their own lives . So many gone forever . My wife - The Overseers - We need to fight them . Light . I see the light of the leader . I had a mission . I failed . I must die . I must not betray - I don 't think Len committed a crime for profit or passion . - No drugs ? - He was clean . It 's the Udara . It 's some kind of lingering mind control . That 's one possibility . George , we were there . Is it any wonder our race suffers ... from more personality disorders and psychosis ... at a far greater rate than humans ? Yes . Our client was very pleased . So pleased , in fact , that he has a very special order . It 'll cost you 250,000 , Cummings . - How much ? - You heard me . Larry , let 's not squeeze the golden goose so hard that he chokes . Your big shot clients can afford it . I mean , how major a deal is this ? Larry , I don 't think that 's any of your business , now , is it ? The price is still a quarter of a million . This well runs dry , that 's it . There 's no more business . - How about it , Cummings ? - All right . When do I get the specifications ? I 'll call you back . Just be ready . Thank you , brother . Thank you . This is the physical education building at Hesiod University ... where the Newcomer held the college 's volleyball team hostage ... while wearing what police described as at least 10 pounds of dynamite . Now , authorities have still not disclosed how much money ... may have been extorted from anxious parents - but reliables sources indicate it may be in the millions - Sorry I 'm late . I - I know I should have called . Well , I just saw you on the news . - Doing my job . - At some risk . More so than usual , yes . Susan , we can 't have it both ways . Buck is going to make his own choices . If you want someone to blame , blame me , all right ? If he sees me as a role model , what am I supposed to say ? That I don 't like the work ? That I can 't do the work ? I get the point , George . I never expected you to lie to him . Well , he - he 's quite enthusiastic about this . And I 'm spoiling it . He would do a better job knowing we were behind him . Susan , I never questioned your support . I know I should have given more thought ... about how you felt about this . When Buck graduates , when he goes out on the street ... I 'll probably worry as much as you . Your perspective 's gonna get a major wake-up call . - Not hungry ? - Why are the kids so late ? Probably because they 're not kids anymore . I heard the bomber had an accomplice . Any leads ? Not really . This is the second Newcomer crime ... without a logical background or motive or - - Well , that 's strange . - Hmm . Do you remember the Udara ? Of course . You think they have something to do with this ? Yes , I do . For the Udara ... the end always justified the means . Now , why does a construction worker suddenly become an extortionist ? And why does a model cop suddenly become an assassin ? What does Matt think ? Well , Matt sees profit or passion behind every crime . Well , it wouldn 't be the first time , George . Besides , once the ship crashed and we gained our freedom ... there was no reason for the Udara to exist anymore . Just as well . They were obsessed and dangerous . We were no better than cattle , George , in a slow line to slaughter . You don 't condone what they did ? The Udara stepped out of that line . They fought back with the meager resources they had at their command . But they lost all sense of morality . They became worse than the monsters they were fighting . The Udara instilled an even greater fear . We even stopped trusting each other . How many of our people died because of their attacks ? Their provocations ? Susan ? Susan ? Susan , what 's the matter ? What is it ? I was Udara , George . - I 've never heard ' em like this . - You don 't think they 'll break up , do you ? For me going to the academy ? That 's ludicrous . I don 't mean to bruise your ego , but your name hasn 't come up . They 're shouting about Udara or freedom or something . Udara ? I couldn 't just sit there wondering - wondering if you were still alive , if my children would be taken from me . You think I didn 't worry ? You think I didn 't ask for you or the children every chance I got ? And then what ? Do whatever they say ? Suffer every indignity ? Every degradation ? We were treated like animals , George . The Udara were killers . Every dark atrocity went - Atrocity ? Fighting back , an atrocity ? Destroying Overseers , an atrocity ? Wanting to save my family and survive , an atrocity ? What is the point of survival once you 've lowered yourself to their level ? What is the difference between us and the Overseers ? - I knew the difference , George . - Well , many of you didn 't . What ? Is it better to die a slave ? I rejected that with all my being . - You 've forgotten too much . - You sound so sure of yourself . I was ! I am ! Then why have you kept it from me ? If you were so sure , why didn 't you tell me ? We have always shared everything . It 's because you know , don 't you ? You know the end can 't always justify the means . You 've become too human , George . What ? " The meek shall inherit the earth " ? Look around you . Do you see that happening here ? Did that work back on the ship ? Admit it . What Udara did , didn 't it give you some hope ... some satisfaction to finally see fear in the eyes of the Kleezantsun ? Udara chose to make sacrifices ... rather than wait for the Overseers to kill us . Don 't you see the difference ? Yes . But you had no right to sacrifice those who didn 't make that choice ! We were a subjugated people . We were a desperate race . But we still had to have a conscience ! We absolutely should not lose sight of the victims of crime . Susan in the Udara blows my mind , George . She didn 't even come down for breakfast . The kids-you should have seen the look in their eyes . They heard ? Just that we were loud and angry and - I 'm really sorry , man . I slept on the couch . I felt like I was in one of those TV sitcoms ... only I wasn 't laughing . - What did Susan say she - - I didn 't even want to know . I didn 't ask . Well , I know how you feel about the underdog : No " putz , " no glory . - Uh , that 's " guts , " George . - It 's not funny . - No , it 's - it 's not . - Human history is filled with examples ... of people who commit heinous and unconscionable acts . North something against South something . Protestant against Catholic . Arab against Jew ... and white against color and - - Some of those causes were noble . - Oh , so you think it 's all right . The Udara were justified in what they did ? Acceptable terrorism ? That 's a label , George . One person 's terrorism is another person 's ... affirmation of life . Matt , we really need to find out more about the Udara . Oh , absolutely . - Hey , do you think Susan would be the right person to - - Hmm . Oh , hey , no , George . George , don 't ask me - - Uh , uh - - Gary . - Right . Have you seen Francisco or Sikes ? - No , Cap . I haven 't seen ' em . - Albert . - Not lately . - Zapeda , do you have any - - Sikes is in Interrogation , Captain . Is there anything I can do before I leave on the cruise of a lifetime ? Have you seen this request ? " All stations , please report ... " any Newcomers in custody attempting suicide ... " and / or mention , and / or reference to Udara ... and / or mention , and / or reference the phrase 'Take our blood , we will be free . " ' Signed Francisco . Why am I not surprised ? That 's Udara , sir . Thank you , Albert . And this blood thing - I mean , what the hell is an Udara ? Francisco and Sikes are on it , Captain . It 's a connection to the Carter hit and the bomber extortion . Yeah , but what is it ? Is it a rock group ? Some satanic cult deal ? - Albert . - Um , well , it 's definitely not a rock group . Tell Francisco and / or Sikes to see me when they 're available , if it 's not asking too much . Yes , sir . Look . This is difficult for both of us . We 're sure these two Newcomers were or are Udara . - Where is George ? - He 's around . Susan , it 's better that I do this . Really ? Better for whom , Matt ? We 've got this Guini guy in custody . He 's not saying much . We need information . Since you and George aren 't exactly seeing eye to eye - He told you . He actually told you about our fight . - The Udara is police business . - I understand that , Matt . I 'm talking about our private life . This is more important than whether I know my partner slept on the couch . Major crimes are being committed . Lives are being lost . Susan ... you 're a citizen in a land of laws now . Ask your dam n questions . So , what did you learn , other than the fact that I 'm up to my spots in faldo ? Secrecy was the name of the game , George . Everything was on a need to know basis . She believed , she volunteered ... was given several trial assignments . - She wouldn 't say what . - Structure ? Leaders ? She doesn 't know that much . A woman called Avra was the leader . She gave Susan her orders . She 'd be in her 70s by now . Does Susan know where this Avra lives ? That 's when I lost her . She clammed up tight , insisted on talking to you . Detective . Susan , please . You had good reasons for what you thought you had to do . I feel differently , but I don 't want this to spoil what we have . You know how I feel about you . These questions - they can wait . Let me take you home . I - I don 't want this anger between us . I can 't live like that . I want to go home with you , George . Listen to me first , and then no more questions . Ever . The Udara were committed to fight to the death . We saw no end to the struggle , and many died . Some became too old to fight . Avra said we had to have a reserve . A force that could not be implicated or exposed ... no matter what horrible things ... the Overseers might do to them . We needed new fighters ... completely dedicated to the cause ... ready to carry out any order without fear . Without hesitation . Without mercy . Go on . We stole a mind-altering gas from Special Section . It was absorbed through the eyes . The shadow force was seeded . - Seeded ? - Once - Once the gas was absorbed , they could receive what humans call ... uh , hypnotic suggestion or mind control . The trigger , um - It would activate them . Then they were given a phrase ... that would initiate their mission . If they returned , all memory of Udara , of what they had done ... would be wiped out by a termination phrase . And if they didn 't return ? They were programmed to take their own lives ... rather than betray the cause . Do you know the phrases , Susan ? No . Avra kept them to herself . George , I don 't know how this could be happening now . I don 't understand . Tina , the police officer - she would 've been nearly a child on the ship . The Udara needed young people - children - so we would be ready to fight for generations . George , you have to understand what it was like for me . We were separated so often . The Udara was hope . We had to have hope . Susan , look at me . You seem to know an awful lot about the seeded ones . But it must have been the Udara 's greatest secret . Yes . None of the children were seeded without permission from a parent . George ... I let them seed Emily . Hi . - Hey . - Where 's Dad ? Slept in my room . Doesn 't want to talk about it . I hate this . I even told him I 'd quit the academy if it would help . - Do you want to ? - No . No . I 'm handling it . - What 's there to handle ? - Oh , you know , the jerks ... the ones who play the species card . I get really pissed off at their little power trips . - Don 't lose your cool , Buck . - Yeah , well , one of these days ... I might just wipe the smirks off of their faces . - They 're not worth it . - That 's what I keep telling myself . Don 't you think Dad went through the same thing ? Probably worse . He was one of the first . See ya . Is this a bonus when your family 's breaking up ? I guess so . Thanks . You just have an insight into it ... that no other teacher I know can come up with , you know . I - I just thought that was really interesting . It was really inspiring . - Matt . - Ah , coming . Trying to decide on burial or cremation . Oh , God ! I knew it . A day late and 1,200 bucks poorer . - I 'm sorry . - Hey , George , it 's a car . It 's not a wife . It 's not a daughter . Let 's go find this Avra . I just keep trying to remind myself about what it was like in those terrible times . But my own daughter walking around like sh-she 's some potential time bomb - Relax . She 's covered . Gary and Zap are on the day watch . - I thought Zapeda was going on vacation . - They both volunteered . Volunteered ? - How 'd Emily take it ? - We didn 't tell her . - What ? - She doesn 't need to know . Why should she worry about something that may never happen ? - If she 's having these dreams - - I can 't very well ask her about that . You 're nuts , George . I 'm not saying it 's gonna happen ... but you don 't know who 's picking these Newcomers to commit these crimes ... - or how they do it . - We 'll find out . She ought to know . That 's all I 'm saying . Susan and I decided not to tell her . It 's about all that we can agree on . Just the knowledge of being seeded and what the consequences could be - - She didn 't do anything wrong . What if a terrorist group - - This is not your call ! All right . We decentralized our minicomputers using LAN-based S. Q. L. database servers . I 'm running a Squeegee level six with some of my own code . Oh , yes . Oh , we are really cutting through it now . No . No hits . No Avras coming in or out of Newcomer Immigration . At least in her 60s ? You sure ? Reasonably sure . All right . 2,300 female Newcomers processed between ages 60 and 70 . Still surviving : 412 . Still involved with B. N. A. : 316 . But that means we have hard current data ... mostly because they still get regular old-age welfare benefits . - 316 . - Yeah . I could recheck real fast . No , no . We believe you . What about photo identification ? Uh , no offense , uh , Detective , but , uh ... due to the commonalty of certain Newcomers ' physical characteristics - Please don 't say we all look alike . No photos . B. N. A. changed to retina readers on all welfare recipients . We did have a lot of fraud . Of those 316 , how many still live around L. A. ? . - Ninety-two percent . - Yeah ! - A sting ? - Sure . We get the B. N. A. computers to spit out form letters to each one - some big increase in the benefits package . But they gotta come in for an information meeting , a qualification check . Vice did one last month on their outstanding warrants list . Used the last available addresses to send out " You 've won a week in Hawaii " letters . Busted 28 winners and some really awful-looking resort wear . Sting - that 's a great idea . It 'll save us a lot of time . Yeah , but Susan 's gotta be there to identify Avra . Oh , she will . Look , Matt . Matt . - About before , I - - Forget about it , George . - I 'd really like to apologize . - No , no . No , no . Ah , ah , ah - I really am sorry . All right , gentlemen . You 've got your sting . And the overtime for surveillance . How soon is this welfare orientation thing ? Letters will go out tonight . The required meeting 's in three days . That fast ? Wouldn 't you get a better turnout if you gave the women more time ? We have to find this Avra very quickly . These Newcomers , sir , they have no intent - - They have no - - George . - No control . - George , I understand . We all understand . Go get ' em . Thank you . Robbery , however , is still ... one of the leading forms of street crime . Particular attention should be given to banks , bank messengers , armored cars - gas stations , liquor stores . Al I right . Listen up . We need a few cadets to fill out security for this TV debate ... between Paul Bearer and Senator Silverthorne . It 's a live broadcast , and the politicos don 't want any ... demonstrators , streakers or nutballs trying for airtime . Now this is grunt work , people . That 's why we 've chosen you . Volunteers . Sanchez . Dumar . You two report to the gun range after class . Excuse me . Sir . - You got a problem , Francisco ? - Uh , no , sir . It just occurred to me , if none of the regular officers are a Newcomer ... I mean , with a Newcomer candidate , well , wouldn 't the department 's image be a little - - Let me worry about our image , cadet . - Good point , Francisco . Next time , Dumar . Francisco , be at the gun range . - Back to robberies . Particular attention - - Yeah ! should also be given to malls , grocery stores - No one can blame you . Most of all , you can 't blame yourself . Well , then who can I blame ? I keep thinking that if I had told George ... maybe something could have been done about Emily and the others . Susan , you didn 't even know who the others were . The Udara were extremists . I mean , history is full of people like that - desperate people with a passion to survive . Morality is a judgment made by the winners long after the battle is over . Well , I thought it was over . We were free . The slavery ... the Kleezantsun and Udara - all things we could forget . Matt and George will find out who 's doing this . You know they will . Hey , Larry . What the hell ? I need a password . Your partner mentioned that you were greedy . He neglected to say that you were stupid . Start at his kneecaps , work up . - Whoa ! Wait a minute . - Hey , hey . This is the easy part , pal . Uh , uh , pass - password 's , uh ... Charles , my brother 's name . File name ? Uh , yacht . American version ? Yeah . Yes . Now ... I should scan this ? Yeah . Senator Silverthorne ? You . What - Emily , where are you going ? I just want some more ketchup for my spleen . Sorry . - Mmm . Mmm . - Buck . - Buck . - What ? How 's the training going ? I get hassled , but it doesn 't interfere . I 'm gonna be part of the security team at the TV studio for the debate . How can they do that ? You 've just started . Susan . Actually , I had to embarrass them into it . It 's supposed to be this Mickey Mouse assignment ... but they 're not sending any Newcomers , so - - George . - It 'll be good experience . I don 't think he 's ready . Mom , don 't start . Just stop it , both of you . And please don 't use me because of what 's going down between you two . Work it out , split , take it on Oprah . " Newcomer cops and the women who love them . " I just can 't stand this pleasant phoniness . If you can 't talk to each other , how are you supposed to talk to us ? I 'm taking a bus . Wait for me . - George . - It 's all right . We 've got her under surveillance . Man , I don 't believe those two . What are we doing here ? It 's my bad idea for the day . No . I shouldn 't have started in on Buck . Susan ... do you want me to move out ? Do you want to ? No , never . George , about Emily and Udara - I couldn 't tell you . At first I didn 't know how , and then it just didn 't seem to matter anymore . Of course it matters . Trust always matters . Susan ... you 've given me so much over all these years . I know . I know . - Just hold the thought . - All right . Oh , no . Go ahead . Careful . Hey , George . English-Tenctonese dictionary . A sharp Newcomer uniform noticed it . Found words checked off , remembered your flyer . - Udara . - You betcha . TB-5 , TB-5 , please tune to L. A. P. D. , slip three . Slip three , TB-5 . Fred , enter this , will you , please ? The computer 's been cleaned out . Same with the safe . The deceased had been shopping for an expensive yacht . Background ? Uh , Larry Coleman , boat bum . Small inheritance , then started talking like a lotto winner . Well , he 's the one . Yeah . And then the secret to the Udara is a cash cow somebody else found about . Now it 's gone . Sikes . Yes , I did . Both , huh ? Thank you . The phone company . I asked them to ... check Tina 's number and Len 's number against this phone . This was the triggerman , George . Then who is it now ? All elderly welfare recipients ... please be sure to fill out your forms completely before reaching the table . Thank you . I don 't see Avra yet . The bird is in the nest . 10-4 . With the Continental Congress urging women to boycott British imports - many of them joined the Daughters of Liberty ... as the war continued . Hello ? Yes , but - I see . Emily , it 's for you . They 're patching your father 's office through . - As many as 20,000 - - Hello ? - American women served the Continent - - Yes ? Primarily as nurses . - Yes , I understand . - One woman , Deborah Sampson - Yes , I will . What is this ? A fire drill ? You know anything about a fire drill ? No . You better get in there . Yeah , they can 't make me come back . - I can 't find her . - Keep looking . You 're goin ' the wrong way , man . All elderly welfare recipients ... please be sure to fill out your forms completely before reaching the table . Thank you . George . By the door . Blue scarf and cane . Are you sure ? Yeah . - I 'm sure . - Just came in . Blue scarf , cane . I pay taxes to get services . - Hold it , ma 'am . - Ma 'am . I 'm Detective Sikes . We have some questions for you . Better . Better . Now let 's do it again . Come on . How about this one ? Right . Stares through me like a laser . Can 't or won 't speak English . - Sikes . - She 'll tell me . Thanks . Someone yanked the fire bell at Emily 's school . - They lost her . - No . Okay . Now , you got your audience pass . Now , you 're gonna be seated right here with the Bearer group . Now , over here in a lighting equipment box ... is a gun identical to the one that you just fired . Now , do you think you can find it ? - Sure . - And then what do you do ? Then I walk on stage , don 't hurry . Keep the gun at my side until I 'm six feet away . Then I say ... " Here 's my vote . " Very good , Emily . Now , do you have any questions ? Which candidate do I shoot ? Me , Emily . You shoot me right here . And don 't miss , or I won 't be able to enjoy my victory on election day . If you can see any of these cameras , you 're too close to the stage . Nobody but nobody gets past you . We 're straight ? Yes , sir . The level okay ? Uh , yeah , Kim . That 's good . Uh , let me hear the Paul Bearer mike now , please . But these were your people . Our people . And now they are dead . And for what ? The cause ? The cause ? The fighting is over . Tell us who the seeded ones are . Tell us how to clear them . You 're mistaken . I 'm not who you think I am . A young girl is missing . A teenager . We know she has been seeded . If you have no charges to file , I wish to go . No . You are not Udara . You would not shoot a helpless old woman . Damn . She 's calling his bluff . You are just as guilty as those who are controlling Udara now . You are just as responsible for these criminal acts . Well , I 'm not giving up . Susan . Susan ! You 're right . He could not shoot you . But you know me . You trained me . I am Udara . The missing girl is our daughter . I gave her to you . To Udara . I want her back . You will tell him what he needs to know , or I will kill you right now . Not for the cause . The cause is gone . I kept a holographic plate with a list of the seeded ones ... and the secret trigger codes . It was confiscated in Immigration . Do you remember the codes ? Of course . - I 'm tired of the controversy - - Ready four , and take four . - Three , swing for the audience . - Good men and women ... human and Tenctonese alike can disagree . Now , he 's honest . - Take three and pan . - He 's got a good record fighting crime . But at least I 'm on the record . My opponent has no record in this area . Oh , did I say this area ? He also has no record in foreign affairs ... domestic fiscal policy , agriculture , farm subsidies , the environment . You name it . - So we give Emily this phrase - - And she 'll be deprogrammed . George , we have to find her . I 'll check the A. P. B. , see if they got anything . - George , Susan . - Have they found Emily ? On TV at the debate . I saw . No , Albert . Not Buck . We 're looking for Emily . Yes , Emily . I saw her on TV . She 's in the audience . She 's there . I 'll get the car . Albert , contact Sergeant Montejo at the studio . Have Emily detained and put under a suicide watch . - What ? - Emily is Udara . While the senator has given you what he considers the bad news ... about my relative inexperience in the political arena and the national scene ... - ... let me give you what I perceive - - Yes ? Sergeant Montejo ? He 's around here somewhere . All right . I 'll try and find him right away . He has repeatedly made promises to all of us prior to elections ... and then conveniently forgotten ... or blithely ignored them once in office . He 's a defender of the last existing subsidies ... for the tobacco industry ... and a recipient of $ 400,000 in campaign contributions ... from that same special interest group . He wants to talk about fund-raising ? How about rent-a-vote ? Fiscal policy ? - The senator has supported - - She 's okay . and been defeated on every piece of legislation - - No longer afraid . - No longer the hopeless . Malfeasance . That 's one of his $ 25 words . It 's a kinder , gentler way of saying ... you got caught with your hand in the public 's cookie jar . Get the paramedics there too . Out . I have a question for both candidates . Gun control is perhaps an area that receives the most political lip service of any issue . And despite the polls that show the majority of citizens in the United States ... feel that gun legislation , as it stands , is basically ineffective - Senator Silverthorne , would you like to be the first to respond ? Why is it that people we don 't want to have guns ... always seem to get them , no matter how many laws or bans we pass ? Now , why make it harder ... for decent , honest , hardworking Americans ... to protect themselves from the armed marauder , the thief , the rapist ? Thank you very much , Senator Silverthorne . Mr. Bearer , could we have your response to that ? It 's - It 's difficult to tell people , " You don 't have the right or the means ... to protect yourself , your property or your home . " Can I have your attention ? This is a police emergency . I want you to put camera one on the left wing , camera four on the right wing . Are you nuts ? We 're on the air here , pal . You 're gonna be in the air here , pal , you don 't do what I say . Do it . ... confiscate and destroy the concealable weapons that are already in circulation . This is not a magic panacea . It 's not a quick fix . Nor is it an impossible task . We must - - I can 't use these shots . - I can . Tell them to pan the cameras around . We 're looking for a 16-year-old Newcomer girl . One and four , pan . We 're looking for a girl . Thank you , Mr. Bearer . That concludes this first round of questioning . Now we 'll move into the second portion of our debate . The next round of questions will come from Sara Sashen of the Los Angeles Times . - Miss Sashen . - Senator Silverthorne ... in the last election - you promised to tighten the state 's borders and also ... to curtail the flow of illegal immigrants . - Are you satisfied - - George , right wing . ... with what you accomplished this last term in office ? - I won 't be satisfied - - She 's got a gun . until the last United States citizen in this state is not robbed of gainful employment ... - by some border jumper . - Emily , what are you doing here ? I won 't be satisfied until there are no more holes in the border ... that seriously impede the economy of California . Emily , put the gun down ! Please ! - Buck ! - Here 's my vote ! Hey . Dad ! Shoot her . - Don 't shoot ! - Shoot her ! Don 't shoot ! - Paramedics are on the way . - Hang on , Buck . Let 's get him into the wagon . All right . Ready - Need a hand , ma 'am ? Let 's go , ma 'am . This could still work . She wanted to shoot me . Do you think the audience could tell ? I don 't believe this . Senator , - ... she was still alive when - - - Oh , she 's a crazy sponge head . - She 'll dummy up like the rest of them . - Senator ! Hey . Hey . Let 's go . - Move ! Move ! - Let 's go ! Let 's go ! - Get out of the car ! - Do you realize who you 're talking to here ? Emily , are these the men who gave you instructions ... and told you where to find the gun ? - Hey ! This is a conspiracy ! - Shut up ! - They 're trying to smear me ! - Emily . Yes . Do you know which one called you at school ? It was his voice . That is for kidnapping . You 're also under arrest for murder , conspiracy to commit murder , extortion . Should you so desire and cannot afford one ... an attorney will be appointed to you without charge before questioning . Do you understand these rights as I have told them to you ? All six networks have already projected Paul Bearer as the winner ... in a race which became a non-contest ... after Senator Silverthorne 's arrest on felony , murder , kidnapping and other charges . Citing bizarre circumstances , which are expected - Oh , yeah . - to emerge during the trial , authorities - - I feel really bad . Hey , hey . It 's - It 's - It 's okay . It 's all right . - Hey , Buck . Officer , how you feeling ? - All right . How 's it going ? Cummings is plea-bargaining . Silverthorne is toast . For Larry Duncan 's murder as well . His brother was the immigration officer who took Avra 's holographic plate . Hey , Buck . This came for you from the police academy . Ow . Thanks . How are your ribs ? It only hurts when I move ... or laugh . It 'll be another week before I let him out . - If that 's a porno - - Excuse me . The chief of police called , said he wanted to give me a commendation . Well , that won 't hurt your record . I told him I wanted this tape instead . Some instructors at the academy made it . They thought it was pretty funny . They 've been reassigned . Hmm . Oh . Oh , hey , Buck . Give me some volume . - Oh , let 's not , Buck . - Hey ! Wha - ... a wheelchair to room 5170 . Thank you . So what 's the story on that tape , Buck ? Oh , they were trying to embarrass us . How could I judge you ? Those were unthinkable times . I had to follow my conscience . One of the things I admire most about you : your passion . Look who 's talking about passion . Ripped by subXpacio

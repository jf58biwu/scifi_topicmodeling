Oh , my god , there 's some on my fist . Coming through ! Spitting ! You missed the sink . Harry , if I asked you out on a date , would you reject me because of these elbows ? No , I 'd reject you because I like ladies . Get out ! Where 's today 's paper ? Mary claims that 5 people were killed in that grain elevator explosion , and I could swear that it was 7 . Yes ! Nice job . Aliens , one . Humans , nothing . Spitting . You spit on me . Jeez ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Quick , Harry , get--get Dubcek ! The plumbing has gone mad ! [ Doorbell rings ] Harry !

Well , why don 't you come right in here and let me help you fix ' em ? Thank you . where 's Harry ? Oh , he bumped into Vicki , and they got a little freaky . Well , our bathroom is a shambles ! You know , you 're behind in the rent . If you want me to put money into your plumbing , how about paying the rent ? Rent ? You get a guy up here with a tool belt , and we 'll about the rent . Oh , please , I 'm a businesswoman . This is not a halfway house . Anymore . Oh , yeah ? Well , until you have our bathroom repaired , I wouldn 't stand under a window . Don , I 'll tell you , this place is really starting to get to me . I mean , you know , it 's nice ... it 's nice ... it 's not even nice . Aw , it 's not so bad . It 's just an attic . It 's not just this place , Don . It 's my life . I just want something else . Something else ? You know , sometimes I just wish somebody would take me away from here . Sally , are you saying what I think you 're saying ? I 'm saying I want someone to take me away from here . Where 'd I lose you ? Oh , you didn 't lose me , Sally . I 'm onto you like white on rice . [ Quietly ] So what are you doin ' on Friday night ? [ Clears throat ] S-S-so ... [ Coughs ] So what are you doin on Friday night ? Alissa . Solomon 's trying to ask you out . Hah ! No , I 'm not . I--I was talki " to you , Elman . What are you doin ' on Friday ? You want to hang out or something ? Ha ha ha , with you ? I don 't think so . [ Clears throat ] Would you please stop breathing on my hair ? What 's going on over here ? This ass is breathing on my hair ! Nice language . You get detention . I meant ass as in jackass . That 's totally acceptable . You know , " I 'm a jackass , you 're a jackass . " That 's detention for a week . Solomon . Here 's my number . Din-din ! Come and get it before it gets cold . Come on . Oh , it smells so good ! That 's nice . Uh-uh-uh . Head of the table , head of the table . Ooh ! Yeah . Whoa ! I get to carve ? Baby ... you get to do whatever you want . You mean like carve ? Oh , yeah . Anything you want . Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Hey ! Let 's just eat . This is good . Oh , it 's so good . Uh , hello , ladies . Is--is Dick around ? No . Why ? No reason . Uh , just tell him that I have a question I would like to- - no , uh , just tell him that I came by , and , uh- - no , just tell him that I didn 't stop by . Thank you . Wait . Is something wrong ? Uh , no , it 's just that ... I think Sally wants me to propose . She 's--she 's been hinting . And , uh , I would love that , but , you know , if I 'm misreading her , I- - why ? What did she say exactly ? Aw , you don 't want to get involved in this . Yeah , she does . I 'm very good at this kind of stuff . Oh , god , I 'm so nervous , I- - oh , don 't be nervous , Don . Sit down . You and Sally are great together . She 'll say yes in a heartbeat . You think ? Oh , sure . You know , when we go out for drinks and I 'm bad-mouthing Dick up and down , she only has the nicest things to say about you . Really ? Yeah , and Dr. Albright really baits her . That 's true . Are you sure ? Don ... it 's a slam dunk . All right ! I 'm gonna do it ! Well , I 'm building up quite a case against those robber barons downstairs . Quite a case , indeed . Tommy , break this window . Dick , why don 't you just pay Mrs. Dubcek the rent ? Harry , this is our home . What 's got into you ? You 've been spending too much time downstairs . Dick , your rent is way past due . Pay it , or I 'm turning off the heat . Oh , how predictable . Does that come right out of your slumlord 's manual ? Dick , you 're not being fair . Fair ? Is it fair that we have to live in a house with broken windows ? ! Tommy ! Hey , babe . Let 's go downstairs . I 'm gonna fry you up some steak-ums . Don 't try to change the subject , you processed , steak-frying , bottom-Feeding floozy ! You will put " miss " in front of that if you know what 's good for you ! Harry , I forbid you to associate with these drunken kleptomaniacs . Ohh ! Ohh ! They are not kleptomaniacs ! They are nymphomaniacs ! Yeah ! Thank you ! I 'll take you home . Harry ! This is about family loyalty . You walk down those stairs , and you are no longer a Solomon . Vicki ... let 's go get some steak-ums . Sally , you look beautiful tonight . [ Muffled ] Thanks , Don . Dispatcher , over radio : 4-Charley-6 , 4-Charley-6 , please respond to a proposal on the corner of radford and fifth . Oh , my god . Don ... that 's where we are . Is it ? Well , what do you know , it is . Well , what 's a proposal ? Is there gonna be gunfire ? No , Sally . Just ... this . Jewelry ! It 's not just jewelry . Sally , will you marry me ? Marry you ? Is that a yes ? Well ... sure . I guess we could do that . Yeah . Good . Great . Dick , why are we doing this ? You ask too many questions . Just shut up and do it as I taught you . 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ! [ Doing stomp routine ] [ Blowing whistle ] Stop it , stop it , stop it , stop it ! This noise is driving me nuts ! I 'm sorry . We 'll try to keep it down . [ Whispering ] 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ... Dick , it 's freezing in here . Invigorating , isn 't it ? Makes you feel alive . Hey , guys . Oh , lieutenant , I 'm glad you 're here . You know , Don asked me something out of the blue- - cold ? Of course it 's cold . Do you know why ? Because my own brother betrayed me . He and those dubceks think they can freeze us out . Ha ! I thrive at this temperature . Wait , Dick , I need to talk to you about something- - we 've grown accustomed to too many luxuries , Sally . Heat , electricity , cooked meats . It 's made us weak ! Wait ! No , Dick , I- - [ Door slams ] What 's wrong ? Don wants to get married . Oh , to who ? Me , you idiot ! Really ? That 's great ! Yeah . Mrs. Sally Orville . It 'll be great when you guys get married . You 'll be together all the time . All the time . Man . I would 've loved that . I mean ... I don 't even have the same lunch period with Alissa . Well , you know , I have been a woman on this planet 3 years now . I guess the next step is to get married . It 's very popular . You know , major celebrities are doing it all the time . Really ? Then it 's gotta be great . Mm . You know , that guy ought to buy a vowel . Baby , that 's Dan rather . Ain 't nobody gonna sell him a vowel . Mm . Ok , I gotta run down to the store . I was making pigs-in-a - blanket and I ran out of bourbon . It 's cold out there , Harry . You want a little piece of my afghan ? Oh , see ? Now , that 's the respect I deserve . Upstairs no one ever offers me a piece . Much less sleeps with me on a semi-regular basis . Still , I 'm kinda sorry that mama turned off your family 's heat up there . [ Snorts ] Family . That 's not my family anymore . You heard what Dick said . I 'm a Dubcek now . And Dick 's gotta learn that you can 't take advantage of a Dubcek . We come from a proud people , Vicki . Don 't we ? Well , not so much proud as ... uppity . Uppity ! Right . Good . And you can 't take advantage of uppity people . Uppity people are not to be taken advantage of ! Harry , you 've- - you 've become so ruthless . Oh , I 'm a bitch , Vicki . Mr. Kraft , I was wondering if you could do me a really big favor . A favor . Yeah , see , I 'm trying to get some time alone with Alissa . You know what I mean ? And I was just hoping you could throw some of that detention my way . Sit down , Solomon . Come on , man . We 're both guys here . Do me this one solid . Huh ? I said sit down . I don 't believe this man . You know , she 's right . You really are a jackass ! You lookin ' for detention , Solomon ? Hello ! Have you been listening to a word I 've said ? Yes , I want detention . You got it , mister . Thank you . It 's like pulling teeth with this guy . What 's going on ? That jackass just gave me detention . That 's a week , Solomon . Sally ! Congratulations ! Ohh ! The ring . Let 's see the ring . Oh , the ring . Uhh ! Oh , here it is . [ Blows ] Oh , it 's beautiful ! Oh , you must be so thrilled . Yeah , I am . I mean , hey , it 's every girl 's dream to be tied down to her guy for the rest of her life , huh ? Tied down . Yeah . Ok . I 've always had these crazy dreams of , I don 't know , backpacking through Boston or ... opening a souvenir shop in downtown Korea . Now I don 't have to worry about which one to do because I 'm not gonna do any of them . I 'm gonna marry Don , and that makes me happy . Uh , you 're not planning on writing your own vows , are you ? Sally , you don 't have to get married . What do you mean ? Of course I do . He asked me . You don 't have to say yes . It 's not written in stone . Yeah , but what about this stone ? You can always give it back . I mean , Sally , you 're obviously not ready for this kind of commitment . And Don , of all people , should have picked up on that . I mean , my god , how could he even think to propose when it 's so obvious ? Yeah . I wonder where he got that idea . Oh , god . You guys are so lucky no one wants to marry you . Hey , um , can I ask you something ? Yeah . Um ... in class yesterday , were you really asking Elman if he wanted to hang out ? Yes . Yeah . We 're- - you know , we 're buds . [ Clears throat ] Play racquetball . Occasional brunch . Oh . Why do you ask ? No reason . Ok . You know , I 've been known to play racquetball . Really ? Well , you should come one time with us . You mean with you and Elman ? Yeah . Ok . Well , what if , uh , Elman didn 't show up ? Would you still come ? I 'd prefer that . Really ? Well , then , he 's out . So when shall we play ? Yeah--the truth is , I don 't play racquetball . Really ? Me neither . Cool . Dick , please . Can 't we go to my place ? Wouldn 't a hot shower be nice ? I need no warmth . The cold is like an old friend . I was born for the tundra . Ok , let 's get right to it . You stink . You need to wash . Showers are the opiate of the fragrant , Mary . I 'm a squatter , and I 'm proud to be so . Besides , as soon as I go , Dubcek 's gonna padlock the door . Well , I 'm sorry , Dick , but I 've got to leave . Oh , hello , Mary . God 's teeth , it 's cold in here ! Have you seen Sally ? No . I don 't understand it . I haven 't heard a word from her since I proposed . Why would she do that ? I don 't know . Why are you asking me ? And I was so pumped up . I thought it was gonna be a slam dunk like you said . Well , I- - I don 't think I said slam dunk . Yes , you did . Well ... what I meant by " slam dunk " was ... you never really know . Ohh ... all right , where is he ? ! Dick , get it here ! You ! Oh ! Are you referring to us ? Out of my house , interlopers . Sally . Where have you been ? Yeah , Sally , I could have used some support here . Support ? What about me ? Don asked me to marry him ! [ Gasp ] He what ? ! Why wasn 't I informed ? I tried to tell you , but you wouldn 't listen , Dick ! Well , I--I had my hands full here . Yeah , right . Now look what you 've done ! This is the most important moment of my sister 's life , and because of you , I was not here for her ! What do you have to say for yourselves ? Aah ! Congratulations ! That 's great ! Way to go ! Don , we need to talk . Well , at least I was with her for that last part . I 'll always have that . Well , I think we can all learn a lot from what 's just happened here . This feud ends now ! That 's easier said than done . Mama , you fix their bathroom . Dick , you pay your rent . See ? Wow . You 've been thinking about this a lot . You know , I do like to think of myself as the female ... Golda Meir . Sally , I 'm a cop . I 've got keen instincts . And right now my instincts are telling me that ... I don 't know what the hell is going on . Look ... Don , I am just really ... confused . I mean ... on the one hand , I am like this ... fully developed woman with boobs and the whole shebang , but ... inside I just feel like I 'm still growing . I don 't know where that 's gonna go . Look , I don 't know how long I 'm gonna be on this planet . Nobody does , Sally . Right . Right . And I just don 't want to miss anything . Don 't you ever feel that way ? I shouldn 't have asked you to marry me . No . Oh , Don , I am so glad you did . It made me think , and I have talked to everyone about it . Everyone except my best friend . Ah , Sally . You 're like this beautiful wild horse . If I 'm ... gonna keep you , I 'd ... have to break you . Because if I didn 't , you 'd just keep throwin ' me off and stepping ' on my head . But I don 't want to break you , Sally . I love you . So I guess I 'm gonna have to ... let you go . If , uh ... if someday you should choose to , uh , come back to me ... maybe I 'll be here ... maybe I won 't . We 'll just have to see . So this is it ? You know my number . Yep . 911 . Hey , Don . Can we ... turn on the siren ? You know , for old times ' sake ? Sure . [ Siren ] Harry , I 'm sorry I kicked you out of the family . Mm ... that 's all right . I 'm sorry I turned my back on the family . That 's all right . I 'm sorry I tried to have you arrested . That 's all right . I 'm sorry I tried to get you evicted . That 's all right . Spitting . [ Plink ] You missed the sink . I 'm sorry I missed the sink . That 's all right .

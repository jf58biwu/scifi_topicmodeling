 Uh-Huh . Yeah . Uh-huh . R-really ? This weekend ? Well , I can 't say no to you . You 're Mary 's mother . Yeah , it sounds wonderful . No , no . Mary didn 't tell me a thing . Didn 't tell who what thing ? Yeah , I 've noticed that about her , too . It 's off-putting , isn 't it ? Who 's that ? It sounds terrific , Martha . Martha . My mother . Yeah . Oh , god , no ! Yes , best to you , Martha . Yeah , right , right . I can 't wait for you to meet me . What did you just do ? ! You didn 't tell me that I was gonna meet your parents this weekend . You 're not ! Well , they said that you 'd made the plans . A--a month ago , when we were engaged . That would be 2 weeks before you ruined everything . Come on , Mary . It 'll be fun . Telling my parents my engagement is off is not my idea of fun . What , you haven 't told them yet ? Are you kidding ? For years , they predicted I 'd become an old spinster who sits alone every night drinking wine and talking to her cat . Dr. Albright . Dr. Albright , they were out of that zinfandel you like , but I did pick up your dog food . I have one dog ! Mary , please ! I won 't say a word about our breakup . I can 't . I 'm still in denial . Do you think I want to spend my weekend pretending to be engaged to a lunatic rather than tell my parents the truth ? I 'll pick you up in the morning . We 're just pretending ! If you dare to try and touch me , I will choke the life out of you . Well , what if I bump into you accidentally ? Fine . In the shower ? Be in your driveway at 8 : 00 tomorrow . Tomorrow ? You can 't go away . You promised you 'd help me move out of my apartment . Oh , I 'm so sorry , Nina . Oh , thanks a lot . Now I see who 's important around here . Uh , yes , that would be me . Ok . Fine . But the next time you can 't separate the cheese slices in your lunchables , don 't come running to me . What have I done ? ! Tommy ! Harry ! Sally ! What do you think of this jacket ? Mmm , it 's a little tweedy . Whoa ! But you win me over with the patches . Oh . I 've got to make a good impression when I meet Mary 's parents . Mary Albright 's parents ? Tommy : they 're still alive ? My god , they must be so old . Probably had her really young . Now stop it ! This is important . I have to win their love and respect . Why ? You don 't even have Mary 's love and respect . Not at the moment , but I 'm hoping that if I win her parents over , she 'll see me in a new light and fall in love all over again . Dick , that 's genius ! I don 't know . I 'd rather have a red - hot poker stuck in my eye than hang out with my girlfriend 's mom and dad . Hey , what if her parents have a red-hot poker and they surprise you by sticking it in your eye ? No . No , I 'm sure they 're lovely people . After all , they mixed and poured the Dna cocktail that is ... Mary Albright . Still , Dick , just to be safe , we should go with you . Oh , no , no . I 've got a much more important assignment for you . Cleaning up our parks and streams ? No . Nina 's moving , and I volunteered you to help her . Wait . You mean we have to lug heavy boxes all weekend ? Yes . Well , do we get to go through her stuff ? How could you not ? All right , then . Well , what do you think ? Does Mary look more like me or George ? Well , Martha , I did notice that you and Mary have the same patrician nose . Whoa . I think she does favor Martha 's side of the family more than mine . But at least she got her father 's generous butt . Mary , that eye shadow makes you look tired . Thank you , mother . Just trying to help . Martha , darling , why don 't you run and get the kids those sandwiches ? Well , yes , of course , George . I 'll run and get the kids those sandwiches . I keep forgetting you were paralyzed in the war . I really should go and help her . I wouldn 't want her to slip and fall into a bottle of gin . They 're very nice . No , they 're not . They 're sour , miserable people who don 't like anybody . Oh , I should have brought flowers . Do they like flowers ? I can get flowers . Stop worrying . This time tomorrow , we 'll be on our way home , and you 'll never see them again . I wouldn 't bet on it . What 's that supposed to mean ? I don 't know about you , Dick , but when I eat ham , I gotta have a beer . Oh , and when I drink beer , I gotta have ham . Ham and beer . That 's us , George . Are you done yet ? Yep , snug as a bug . Ok , I think I missed a spot . Guys , could you please be careful ? Yes , absolutely . Starting now . Nina , this place is so great . I mean , it 's so nice and clean . Well , it 's easy to keep things neat when you live alone . The smell , it smells like ... [ Inhales deeply ] Like a mall or ... or the bakery or ... my house smells like feet or cheese or rotten food- - I--I get it . Sally , I get it . Oh , Martha , this is the most delicious , exquisitely flavored , palate - teasing dish I 've ever tasted . What do you call it again ? Busy gal 's lasagna . I must get the recipe . It 's noodles with ketchup on ' em . George ... shut up . Don 't give away her recipes , George . Thank you , Dick . Now , Mary , how about it ? More ? Uh , no , mother , I have enough . She 's on another one of those crazy crash diets , right , Dick ? Well , no , I just don 't think she likes your lasagna as much as I do , Martha . Yes , I do , and I 'm not on a diet . I 'm happy the way I am . Well , there comes a point when you just have to accept what the good lord has given you . Lord knows I have . Come on , Dick . I 'll sweeten up your drink . Mmm . Right . Right . George , I 'm right behind you . Well , Mary ... your daddy and I are just tickled pink that Dick is the one . The one what ? Oh , Mary Margaret , you know very well the one what . Mr. Right . The man you 're going to marry . Oh . Yeah . That 's the plan . I 'm just ecstatic . I don 't know why you 're not a little more excited . Oh , I am , mother . Sometimes I get so giddy I can hardly contain myself . But you know , you can only scream so long before you black out ! I 'm Nina . And I 'm special because I 'm moving . I 'm Sally . I think I am so great . Whoa , your hair looks really good today , girlfriend . Oh , shut up . No , it doesn 't . Let 's go look at some magazine ... well , uh , that 's all the underwear . Let 's get it down to the truck . Ok . God , I 'm gonna miss this place . Yeah . Why are you moving , big-ass rats ? No . They raised the rent . Oh . That 's too bad . It 's so big and bright . My room only has one window , and it looks out on the slaughterhouse , and sometimes a brown mist floats in and makes my hair all greasy . If I 'd have known that , you could 've moved in here with me . Us ? Roommates ? Just you and me , no guys ? Yeah . But it 's too late for that , I guess . No ! No , it 's not . Finally , the last box . My back is killing me . Oh . Y-you gotta keep it loose . Hey , you know what you do ? You go down , you get all of Nina 's stuff off the truck , and then you go back to our place , get my stuff , and bring it back here . Boy . You really think it 'll work ? Well , I 'm willing to give it a shot . Actually , my back feels fine . Oh , get moving ! Come on . I 'll tell you one thing , Dick . This is one bar I 'll never get thrown out of . Oh , Dick , I 'll show you where the linens are so you can make up the couch . The couch ? Oh , now , punkin , it 's perfectly Ok with daddy and me if you and Dick share the same room . No ! No , I-it 's not . I know how uncomfortable it makes you feel . Really ? Never stopped you before . Oh , but , mom , I- - really , princess , no , it 's fine with us . About time this house saw some action . No , dad , really , I--I- - say no more , George ! It 's settled . Mary and I will share a room . Done deal . Now let 's go outside and smoke these things . I 've got some funny stories about Mary . Oh ho ho ho ho ho ! Me , too . Oh , I cannot wait to move out on my own . It 's nothing personal . It 's just that you guys are really , really annoying , you know ? Yeah . Enough said . Sally , we 're all very happy for you , and I know that there are gonna be some good times , but there will also be some lonely ones , and so ... I want you to have my gnome . No , Harry , you see , I 'm moving to get away from your crap . Ok ! I got my gnome back . You know , Dick would never give you permission to do this . Yeah . That 's why I 'm doing it while he 's out of town . Well , on the plus side , at least we can turn Sally 's room into a storage area . Well , wait a minute . I don 't have a room . Or maybe a cool little music room with some black-Light posters . Hello . Man without a bedroom here . You know what 'd be even better ? A skeeball parlor . Skeeball ? In our home ? Yes ! Yeah ! Now here 's little Mary 's sixth birthday party . Oh , you got her a pony . No . That 's Mary . Her uncle Neil got her a brown lederhosen . All the way from Munich . Germany . Oh , little Mary 's crying . She didn 't want to share a sheet cake with the other kids . Oh , here 's the big spelling bee . Mary 's word is " because . " Watch her sweat . [ Martha laughs ] George : " b " " e " " c " " a " " w " ! Ah ! Magpie . Why 'd you miss such an easy word ? Because . She can say it . She just can 't spell it . You 're a hoot and a half , son . Thank you , daddy . Dick , can I see you in the bedroom ? Oh , coming , magpie . Oh , yeah . Wonderful . He called me son . My plan is working . Your plan to piss me off ? No . My plan to win their hearts and then yours . Oh , so by joining in my parents ' psycho mind games and mocking my fat childhood , you thought I 'd love you again ? Psycho mind games ? I--Wh- - let me tell you about my wonderful parents . In 1961 , my father had an affair with a stewardess . Well ... you mean a flight attendant . No . A stewardess . That despicable dog ! My mother found them together , and she was so wonderful , she dumped it all on me . Me , Dick , a little girl . Oh , Mary , what an awful picture- - a bitter old drunk describing some tawdry affair while spoon-feeding you strained bananas as you sit in your little highchair . Well , I was 9 . And you were still eating baby food ? My poor Mary . Oh , Dick , the whole- - the whole thing tore me apart . I felt it was my fault . It was their fault , Mary ! I felt so alone . You 're not alone , Mary , not anymore ! And to think I had my hand in that man 's humidor ! Ohh ! Harry , you gotta help me with this one . It 's full of books and rocks and stuff . It weighs a ton . Step aside , junior . Time to clean and jerk . 1 , 2 , 3 . It was empty . No . I 'm the strongest man in the world . Ooh , this is going to be so much fun . I know . So what do you want to do tonight ? Uh , I don 't know . Um , make stir-fry and rent a chick flick ? Yeah , like full metal jacket . Or boys on the side . Right , right . Boys on the side . Or full metal jacket ! I 'll give you the secret to a great bloody Mary , Dick . Horseradish . It 's not the horseradish , Georgie . It 's the vodka . You know , getting this hot tub was the smartest thing I 've ever done . Oh , really ? And what would the stupidest , most loathsome , and hurtful thing be ? Not getting the floating thermometer . Can I get you anything , Dick ? A drink ? Maybe some coffee ? Tea . Or maybe me . Is that what the little flying strumpet said to entice you ? Is one sleazy pickup line all it takes to destroy a family ? ! Mary ! For god 's sakes . You told him ? I couldn 't stand it anymore . Martha . You told our daughter about my--my--my- - that 's right ! Your little fling . You-hoo-hoo bet I told her . So she could play the martyr for 36 years . How do you think I felt ? Alone and scared , a sheet cake her only solace . She drove me to it , princess . All right ! Maybe I did . But I was too fat , and I hated my body , and those damn diet pills made me crazy . You took diet pills ? Our family doctor prescribed them . For god 's sakes , it was the sixties ! She went to Dr. Powell for more than just pills . [ Gasps ] Dr. Powell ? ! He had hair in his ears . She went to Dr. Powell , who was her cousin . He was my step-cousin ! He was my golf partner ! He was a man ! Enough ! You two lie to each other and cheat on each other , and I 'm stuck in the middle . You 've made my life miserable . Why the hell did the two of you stay married ? [ Through clenched teeth ] To try to give you a happy home . Oh , my god ! Look at the two of you ! Have you no shame ? Um , Sally , I know you just got here , but you left your socks- - shh . Honey ... it 's shark week . You want me to help you move that futon into your room ? My room ? Yeah . The room down the hall . Oh , no . I like this room . This is the living room . Yeah , and I 'm gonna live in it . You got to pick your room , I get to pick mine . No way . Look , I didn 't complain when you finished my milk . Your milk ? You just wrote " Sally " on my milk . So that 's how it 's gonna be , huh ? Well , as long as we 're being honest with each other , I don 't like how you leave the toilet seat down . That 's the way women use it . Yeah , sure , Nina . That 's the way women use it . Look , you know , being your roommate is not as much fun as it used to be . You 've only been here an hour and a half . Yeah , and it 's an hour and a half too long . All right , this is it . The last box of shoes . Well ... load it up , boys , 'cause I 'm movin ' out ! No . Absolutely not ! Sally , for the first time in my life- - do it , or I 'll kill you . Ok . You know ... this weekend has been more cathartic for me than the entire time I spent in rehab . Rehab ? 1982 . I know . I said I was visiting your aunt Dee Dee . Ok , Mary , everything 's packed . Chop-chop , gotta go . Dick ... I think we should stay . What ? My parents and I have been talking since the little blowup in the hot tub , and I think we 've made some progress . Progress ? Are they getting a divorce ? Divorce ? They 've been married for 46 years . Yes , but 46 horrible years . I 'm sure they 've had their ups and downs , but it 's only made them stronger . That 's what marriage is . Oh , my god , they 've brainwashed you . Now you 're one of them . Dick , I want to thank you for bringing everything out in the open . I feel like a tremendous weight 's been lifted from this family . I want to tell you two something . There 's nothing more exhilarating than honesty . Oh ! Oh ! So honesty 's your game , is it ? Yeah , I 'll give you honesty . Your precious little Mary Margaret ragamuffin magpie has been lying to you ! She didn 't even want to come here because she didn 't want to tell you that- - our engagement is off ! We 're through ! But that 's Ok , because I don 't want to marry her anyway . I don 't want to marry anyone- - Not after meeting you . If this marriage was a horse , you 'd shoot it ! Dick , we forgive you . Forgive me ? Would you like some cocoa ? I don 't want any cocoa . I don 't want anything . I just want to climb into a spaceship and fly to a far-off galaxy , millions of light-years away from this twisted and sadistic human freak show ! He 's the one . He 's the one . So how did the move go ? Well , the first one went pretty smooth , but the second one was a bitch . We had a good rhythm going for the third move , but the fourth and fifth moves were just hell . Wussies . You know , I really dodged a bullet today , Dick . To think I was this close to moving in with Nina . Hah . She 's not nearly sophisticated enough for me . I dodged a bullet , too . I thought marriage was a beautiful union of 2 souls . It turns out it 's a hot , bubbling , chlorinated sea of lies , betrayals , and addictions , and I don 't want to go there . Well , I 'll go . That sounds relaxing . No . From now on , we 're footloose and fancy-free . From this day forward , people will refer to me as a lifelong bachelor . You 're not gonna start wearing pastel cardigans and open up an antique store , are you ? Whatever gets me the ladies . Yeah , Dick , you 'll do great . George , there 's something I have to tell you . I 'm listening . You 're not Mary 's father . I 've suspected that for a long time , Martha . Does she know ? Oh , don 't be silly . Of course not . Good . Next time they visit .

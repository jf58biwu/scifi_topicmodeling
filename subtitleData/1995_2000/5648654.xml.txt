YOU WANNA TELL US WHAT YOU 'RE DOING OUT HERE ? [ Gasping ] - SIR ? - [ Shouting ] [ Grunting ] [ Yelling , Gasping ] [ Man Grunting ] TURN OVER ! GIVE ME YOUR HAND . DAMN AMP-HEAD . OH , LORD . JIMMY , CHECK THIS OUT . SARAH ? SARAH ! [ Sirens Wailing In Distance ] [ Indistinct ] YEAH . OUR BLIND DATE 'S NOT OFF TO A GREAT START . I 'VE BEEN WAITING HERE NEARLY TWO HOURS . I WAS ASKED TO MAKE SURE YOU WEREN 'T FOLLOWED . IT 'S JUST YOU , ME AND THE DRUG DEALERS . YEAH , WELL , THIS AREA ... HAS ALWAYS BEEN KNOWN FOR ITS CRIMINAL ELEMENT . ESPECIALLY WHEN CONGRESS IS IN SESSION . - WHAT 'S THIS ? - SOMETHING YOU 'LL WANT TO FOLLOW . FOLLOW WHERE ? THAT 'S ALL I HAVE FOR YOU . WHAT DO YOU MEAN , THAT 'S ALL YOU HAVE FOR ME ? I GET AN ANONYMOUS E-MAIL TO MEET YOU HERE . I DON 'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE OR WHAT YOU WANT . I DON 'T HAVE ANY OBLIGATION OR DESIRE TO GIVE YOU ANY ANSWERS . I 'M NOT ONE OF YOUR SOURCES . THEN YOU 'RE JUST A MESSENGER BOY ? IT 'S LATE , AGENT MULDER . GO HOME . GET SOME SLEEP . WHO TOLD YOU TO CONTACT ME ? HOW DO I KNOW I 'M NOT BEING PLAYED ? I GUESS YOU DON 'T . WELL , YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND RECYCLE THAT THEN . I 'VE BEEN ASKED TO TELL YOU , YOU WALK AWAY FROM THIS , MORE PEOPLE WILL DIE . [ Car Door Closes , Footsteps Departing ] [ TV : Newscaster , Indistinct ] [ Door Closes ] SORRY . I WOULD 'VE GOT HERE SOONER , BUT THE BELTWAY WAS A PARKING LOT . WHAT 'S GOING ON ? MULTIPLE HOMICIDE- - A BIZARRE ONE . THAT 'S JOSEPH PATNIK . HE MURDERED FIVE PEOPLE- - ALL OF WHOM HE INSISTS WAS THE SAME MAN . WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? HE CLAIMS TO HAVE BEEN KILLING THE SAME MAN OVER AND OVER . DOES HE HAVE A HISTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS ? NOT THAT I KNOW . BUT I ONLY JUST GOT THIS CASE YESTERDAY . SO WHAT 'S THE X-FILE ? IN PATNIK 'S NEIGHBORHOOD TWO WEEKS AGO , A BABY-SITTER ATTACKED THE TWO CHILDREN SHE WAS MINDING . SHE TOLD POLICE SHE THOUGHT THEY WERE WOLVES . AND POLICE FOUND NO OTHER MOTIVE FOR EITHER OF THESE ATTACKS ? NONE SO FAR , NO . [ Man ] AGENT MULDER . - I 'M DR. STROMAN . - THIS IS MY PARTNER SPECIAL AGENT SCULLY . THE PHYSICIAN IN CHARGE ? YEAH , THEY CALLED ME DOWN FROM D.C ... . TO TRY AND DEVELOP A CLEAR DIAGNOSIS FOR THE COURT . HAVE YOU ? I WISH I COULD SAY YES . HAS HE BEEN SEDATED ? HEAVY THORAZINE , BUT IT ONLY SEEMED TO KNOCK HIM BACK A NOTCH . HE SEEMS PRETTY MANAGEABLE TO ME . IT MAY BE SOME FORM OF ORGANIC DELUSIONAL SYNDROME , POSSIBLY DUE TO CHRONIC METHAMPHETAMINE ABUSE , I DON 'T KNOW . BUT HE IS PRONE TO OUTBURSTS . WHO CALLED YOU DOWN ON THIS CASE ? A DR. KAHN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL HEALTH SERVICES . COULD WE SPEAK TO HIM ? I DON 'T THINK HE 'S IN TODAY , BUT I COULD CHECK FOR YOU . [ Joseph Screaming ] ORDERLY ! [ Screaming Continues ] [ Orderlies ] CALM DOWN , CALM DOWN . YOU 'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT . EASY . YES , DR. STROMAN . [ Newscaster ] LLADOSLAV MIRISKOVIC PERSONALLY ORDERED ... THE RAPE AND MURDER OF THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT CIVILIANS ... IN WAR TORN REGIONS OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA . REPORTING FROM- - YOU SAID YOU GOT THIS CASE LAST NIGHT . WHERE DID IT COME FROM ? IT CAME FROM AN OUTSIDE SOURCE . WHO ? THIS OUTSIDE SOURCE , WHAT 'S HIS INTEREST IN THIS CASE ? WHAT DOES HE WANT US TO UNCOVER ? I DON 'T KNOW . AND YOU 'RE NOT SUSPICIOUS THAT WE 'RE BEING USED ? WE 'VE GOT DEAD BODIES AND CONFESSED MURDERERS . IF WE 'RE BEING USED , IT 'S TO FIND OUT THE CONNECTION . THAT 'S WHAT I 'M INTERESTED IN . [ Woman Screaming ] [ Gunshot ] [ TV , Indistinct ] ISN 'T THIS A SCHOOL DAY ? WE DIDN 'T CUT . WE GOT A PASS . YOU GOT A PASS TO COME IN HERE AND EAT THESE PEOPLE 'S FOOD AND WATCH THEIR TV ? NO . ARE WE IN TROUBLE NOW ? - HOW 'D YOU GET IN HERE ? - THROUGH THE WINDOW . THEY LEAVE IT OPEN FOR THE CAT . WELL , MAYBE YOU SHOULD HEAD BACK TO SCHOOL . NO , NO , NO . USE THE FRONT DOOR . [ TV : Explosions ] MULDER . LOOK AT THIS . THERE MUST BE HUNDREDS OF VIDEOS HERE . ANYTHING GOOD ? ALL I SEE ARE RECORDINGS OF CABLE NEWS SHOWS . THEY 'RE ALL DATED AND IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER . THAT 'S WHAT PATNIK WAS WATCHING AT THE HOSPITAL WHEN HE WENT ALL WIGGY . WHAT IF THERE 'S SOME CONNECTION ? BETWEEN WHAT HE SAW AND WHAT HE RECORDED AND WHAT HE DID ? YOU 'RE THE ONE WHO 'S INTERESTED . [ Tape Ejects ] I JUST WATCHED 36 HOURS OF BERNARD SHAW AND BOBBY BATISTE . NOW I 'M ABOUT READY TO KILL SOMEBODY TOO . I 'M GONNA SHOW YOU SOMETHING . THESE TAPES ARE DATED APRIL 19 , APRIL 21 AND APRIL 23 . EACH CORRESPONDS TO A NIGHT THAT PATNIK COMMITTED A MURDER . - WHAT 'S ON THE TAPES ? - AMONG OTHER THINGS , A ONE-HOUR SPECIAL REPORT ON THE ATROCITIES IN BOSNIA . A REPORT THAT PROMINENTLY FEATURES LLADOSLAV MIRISKOVIC . THE SAME GUY THAT STARTED PATNIK SCREAMING IN THE PSYCH WARD ? AND MY GUESS IS THAT ONCE I REVIEW THE TAPES FOR THE NIGHT THAT PATNIK KILLED HIS WIFE , THAT I 'LL FIND THAT REPORT THERE AS WELL . SO YOU THINK THAT BECAUSE PATNIK SAW THIS WAR CRIMINAL ON TELEVISION , HE WAS SOMEHOW INSPIRED TO GO OUT AND MURDER THESE PEOPLE ? WELL , RECENT STUDIES HAVE LINKED VIOLENCE ON TELEVISION TO VIOLENT BEHAVIOR . BUT THOSE STUDIES ARE BASED ON THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT AMERICANS ARE JUST EMPTY VESSELS ... READY TO BE FILLED WITH ANY IDEA OR IMAGE THAT 'S FED TO THEM , LIKE A BUNCH OF PAVLOV DOGS , AND GO OUT AND ACT ON IT . BUT THEY BELIEVE THAT THE CAUSAL CONNECTIONS ARE THERE . STUDIES HAVE SHOWN CONNECTIONS BETWEEN COW FLATULENCE AND THE DEPLETION OF THE OZONE LAYER . YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT PSEUDO-SCIENCE USED TO MAKE POLITICAL BOOK . ALL I 'M SAYING IS THAT IT 'S CLEAR THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT PATNIK WATCHED ... SOMEHOW TRIGGERED HIS VIOLENT BEHAVIOR . HOW ? THE DOCTOR SUGGESTED AMPHETAMINE ABUSE . MAYBE THAT , COUPLED WITH THE DISTURBING IMAGES ... THAT HE WAS WATCHING , PUSHED HIM OVER THE EDGE . ALL I KNOW IS TV DOES NOT MAKE A PREVIOUSLY SANE MAN ... GO OUT AND KILL FIVE PEOPLE THINKING THEY 'RE ALL THE SAME GUY . NOT EVEN " MUST SEE TV " COULD DO THAT TO YOU . OKAY , THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN IT ? I CAN 'T . NOT YET . WHERE ARE YOU GOING ? I 'M GONNA GET SOME SLEEP . - [ Door Opens ] - LOOKS LIKE YOU COULD USE SOME TOO . NO , I 'M GONNA ... WATCH THE REST OF THESE TAPES , JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY . YOU HAVE FUN . [ Door Closes ] [ Phone Ringing In Mulder 's Room ] [ Ringing Continues ] [ Mulder Chattering , Indistinct ] NO , SHE DOESN 'T . [ Crunching On Ice ] ? [ TV : Talk Show Theme Music ] [ Humming ] [ Applause ] [ Man ] GOOD LUCK ON THE PRIZE TONIGHT . BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER , I 'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE- - [ Giggling ] [ Moaning ] WASHER / DRYER ! TELL ' EM ABOUT IT , JOHNNY . THIS BEAUTIFUL WASHER / DRYER- - [ Gunshot ] [ Knock At Door ] [ Mulder ] SCULLY ? YEAH ? I JUST GOT A CALL . THERE 'S BEEN ANOTHER MURDER . YEAH . I 'LL BE RIGHT THERE . IT HAPPENED JUST LESS THAN AN HOUR AGO . IT SEEMS TO MATCH OUR PATTERN- - A HOUSEWIFE GONE BERSERK . THE CAR 'S BEEN MOVED . DID YOU TAKE IT OUT LAST NIGHT ? NO . UH , I WENT OUT , AND I GOT A PAPER THIS MORNING . WHY ? NOTHING . NOTHING . LET 'S GO SEE THE CRIME SCENE . [ Dog Barking ] [ Man ] THAT 'S ALL THE INFORMATION I HAVE , SIR . [ Mulder ] THANKS , DETECTIVE . YOU 'RE WELCOME . JUST GOT THROUGH TALKING TO THE DETECTIVE IN CHARGE . THE SHOOTER 'S NAME IS HELENE RIDDOCK , AGE 42 . THEY TOOK HER TO COUNTY LOCKUP . WHAT HAPPENED ? SHE CLAIMS SHE LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AND SAW HER HUSBAND IN THE HAMMOCK ... WITH A BLONDE . [ Barks ] THAT BLONDE ? YEAH , APPARENTLY HE WAS ONLY TAKING A NAP WITH HIS DOG . BUT MRS. RIDDOCK SWEARS SHE LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW ... AND SAW HER HUSBAND IN THE HAMMOCK WITH A BLONDE WOMAN . SO THIS WOMAN KILLED HER HUSBAND BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT HE WAS CHEATING ON HER ? THIS IS NOT EVEN HER HUSBAND . HER HUSBAND 'S A LONG-HAUL TRUCKER . HE 'S BEEN OUT OF TOWN FOR THE LAST TEN DAYS . THIS IS MR. JOHN GILNITZ . HE 'S HER NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR . SHE DIDN 'T EVEN HAVE THE RIGHT BACKYARD . HELENE RIDDOCK LIVES OVER HERE . SCULLY ? YEAH . LET 'S CHECK IT OUT . [ Woman ] ONE OF MY FAVORITES . HE ISSOCUTE . " THE LITTLE TRAVELER " IS NORMALLY $ 129.99 . AND THAT 'S WHAT YOU 'RE GONNA PAY AT THE DEPARTMENT STORES- - A THING OF BEAUTY IS A JOY FOREVER . WHAT DO YOU THINK , SCULLY ? I THINK TELEVISION PLAYS A LARGE PART IN BOTH OF THESE MURDERERS ' LIVES . AS IT DOES IN ALMOST EVERY AMERICAN HOME . BUT TELEVISION DOES NOT EQUAL VIOLENCE . I DON 'T CARE WHAT ANYBODY SAYS- - UNLESS YOU CONSIDER BAD TASTE AN ACT OF VIOLENCE . MORE TAPES . HANG ON A SECOND . I 'LL BE RIGHT BACK . HEY ! HEY ! HEY ! HEY ! - MULDER , WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? - I 'M COMING DOWN . WHAT IS IT ? SOME KIND OF CABLE TRAPPER SCRAMBLER ... RUNNING FROM THE POLE INTO THE HOUSE . MAYBE IT 'S A JOB FOR SPECIAL AGENT PENDRALL IN THE SCI-CRIME LAB . YEAH . YOU WANT IT ANALYZED ? YEAH . I 'LL DO IT . IT MAKES MORE SENSE FOR YOU TO INTERVIEW HELENE RIDDOCK . GET HER VERSION OF THE STORY . MAYBE SHE KNOWS WHAT THIS THING IS . IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH THAT ? NO , THAT 'S , THAT 'S FINE . STAY IN TOUCH . [ Car Door Closes , Engine Starts ] IT LOOKS A LOT LIKE A STANDARD VIDEO TRAP FOR BLOCKING PREMIUM CABLE CHANNELS . WHAT DOES THIS ONE BLOCK ? AMAZINGLY , IT DOESN 'T SEEM TO BLOCK ANYTHING . WELL , WHAT DOES IT DO ? GLAD YOU ASKED . I BET ALL YOU GUYS WERE OFFICERS IN THE AUDIO / VISUAL CLUB IN HIGH SCHOOL , HUH ? THIS IS THE STRAIGHT FEED OFF OUR BARS AND TONE GENERATOR . AND HERE ARE THE BARS AND TONE AS ATTENUATED THROUGH THE DEVICE . - IT LOOKS THE SAME . - WELL , THAT 'S WHAT YOU 'D THINK . WE COULDN 'T DISCERN ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FEEDS- - NOT UNTIL WE COMPARED THEM ON THE OSCILLOSCOPE . IT STILL LOOKS THE SAME . HOLD ONTO YOUR HAT , DUDE . [ Beeping ] WE HAVE TOUCHDOWN . SO THEY 'RE DIFFERENT . SO ? THEY 'RE DIFFERENT . - YOU KNOW THE WAY TV WORKS . - YEAH , YOU CLICK IT ON , YOU GET A PICTURE- - IT 'S A RAPID SERIES OF STILL PICTURES FIRED AGAINST THE TUBE . THERE 'S SOMETHING NONSTANDARD HERE , IN THE VERTICAL BLANKING INTERVAL- - INFORMATION THAT 'S BEING ADDED INTO THE SPACES BETWEEN THE STILL PICTURES . - WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION ? - WE DON 'T KNOW . THIS IS AS FAR AS WE CAN GET WITH THIS EQUIPMENT . - WELL , CAN 'T YOU TAKE IT APART ? - NOT WITHOUT DESTROYING IT COMPLETELY . THAT 'S BY DESIGN . AN AMAZINGLY SOPHISTICATED DESIGN . ALL WE CAN SAY FOR SURE IS- - THIS DEVICE IS EMITTING A SIGNAL . [ Phone Dialing ] [ Phone Ringing ] MULDER . WHERE ARE YOU ? I WAS JUST ABOUT TO CALL YOU . LOOK , I 'M ON MY WAY BACK . YOU MAY HAVE BEEN RIGHT , SCULLY , AT LEAST , PARTLY . THERE IS A FOREIGN SIGNAL BEING INTRODUCED INTO THESE PEOPLE 'S HOMES THROUGH THE TV SET . SCULLY , ARE YOU THERE ? I 'M HERE . I THINK THEY MAY BE RUNNING SOME KIND OF TEST . SCULLY , DID YOU HEAR WHAT I JUST SAID ? SO YOU HAD IT ANALYZED ? YEAH . I JUST TALKED TO AGENT PENDRALL . HE SAID THAT YOU NEVER SHOWED UP . I DIDN 'T TAKE IT OVER TO PENDRALL . THEN WHERE WERE YOU ? I 'D RATHER TALK ABOUT IT WHEN WE GET ON A LANDLINE , OKAY ? WE 'VE DEALT WITH THESE KIND OF PEOPLE BEFORE . WE KNOW WHAT THEY 'RE CAPABLE OF . [ Clicking ] WHAT WAS THAT ? WHAT WAS WHAT ? [ Clicking Continues ] THERE . THAT NOISE . SCULLY , IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG ? MULDER . [ Clicking Continues ] MULDER , WHO 'S LISTENING TO- - SCULLY , LOOK . I 'M GONNA BE RIGHT THERE , OKAY ? DON 'T GO ANYWHERE . SCU- - [ Phone Hangs Up ] [ Phone Redialing ] [ Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] [ Car Approaching ] [ Car Stops ] [ Gasps ] [ Chattering , Indistinct ] [ Pounding On Door ] [ Pot Clattering ] GET BACK . CALL THE POLICE . SCULLY . SCULLY ! [ Phone Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] [ Sighing ] HELLO ? MRS. SCULLY , HI . IT 'S FOX MULDER . WHAT IS IT ? WHAT 'S THE MATTER ? I WAS HOPING THAT YOU 'D HEARD FROM DANA . NO . SOMETHING HAPPENED ? I 'M , I 'M NOT EXACTLY SURE . THERE 'S- - THERE 'S SOME CONFUSION HERE . SHE 'S MISSING . WHAT DO YOU MEAN , MISSING ? WELL , SHE RAN OFF LAST NIGHT . UM ... W-WE 'RE LOOKING FOR HER AS BEST WE CAN . BUT WE ARE A LITTLE CONCERNED . OH , MY GOD . I HATE TO DO THIS TO YOU , BUT I GOTTA HANG UP ON YOU RIGHT NOW . FOX , WOULD YOU PLEASE JUST TELL ME WHAT 'S WRONG ? HANG BY THE PHONE . I WILL CALL YOU AS SOON AS I KNOW SOMETHING . SIR , CAN I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU ? THIS MANHUNT IS BEING CONDUCTED AS IF WE 'RE SEARCHING FOR AN ESCAPED CONVICT . MULDER , I SHARE YOUR CONCERN FOR AGENT SCULLY . BUT SHE FIRED FOUR ROUNDS AT YOU AND AN UNARMED CIVILIAN . THESE OFFICERS SHOULD BE INSTRUCTED NOT TO CONFRONT HER ONCE THEY FIND HER . WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE THEM DO ? JUST TO KEEP AN EYE ON HER UNTIL I CAN GET THERE . I THINK I CAN GET HER TO LISTEN TO ME . SHE DIDN 'T LAST NIGHT . THAT 'S BECAUSE SHE 'S NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR HER OWN ACTIONS . SHE 'S SUFFERING FROM SOME KIND OF PARANOID PSYCHOSIS . BROUGHT ON BY WHAT ? I CAN 'T EXPLAIN THE EXACT MECHANISM , BUT IT HAS TO DO WITH CERTAIN VIDEOTAPES WE WATCHED ... THAT WE RECOVERED FROM A CRIME SCENE . VIDEOTAPES ? VIDEOTAPES THAT CONTAIN AN ELECTRONIC SIGNAL ... THAT SOMEHOW INDUCES VIOLENT BEHAVIOR . [ Sighs ] DO YOU HAVE ANY PROOF OF THIS ? I 'M WORKING ON THAT . WHATEVER PROMPTED HER BEHAVIOR , THE FACT REMAINS THAT SCULLY IS ARMED AND OBVIOUSLY DANGEROUS . I SUGGEST YOU MARSHAL WHATEVER RESOURCES YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU FIND HER FIRST . [ Phone Ringing ] - MULDER . - WE PULLED SOMETHING OFF THAT VIDEOTAPE IN SCULLY 'S ROOM . - WHAT IS IT ? - SOMETHING INTERESTING . BUT WE DON 'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT OVER THE PHONE . BIG BROTHER MAY BE LISTENING . [ Phone Hangs Up ] HERE IS THE TAPE SCULLY WAS REVIEWING LAST NIGHT . WE SCANNED SAMPLES OF THE TAPE ONTO DISKS . DIGITIZED IT . USING SOME INTERPOLATING FREEWARE WE PULLED DOWN OFF THE NET , WE WERE ABLE TO BLANK OUT THE INVISIBLE FRAMES . WHAT AM I LOOKING AT ? WELL , THIS IS THE ACTUAL SIGNAL YOUR CABLE TRAP DEVICE WAS EMITTING . OF COURSE , WE SLOWED IT DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY . IT 'S DESIGNED TO CYCLE AT 15 FLASHES PER SECOND ... TO INDUCE WHAT 'S KNOWN AS THE PHOTIC DRIVING RESPONSE . BRING IT HOME , BOYS . THIS DEVICE IS STIMULATING ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN . STUDIES INTO SUBLIMINAL INFLUENCE HAVE SHOWN A CORRELATION ... BETWEEN HEIGHTENED SUGGESTIBILITY AND THE MANIPULATION OF THIS RESPONSE . - MIND CONTROL ? - 57 CHANNELS OF IT . TACHISTOSCOPIC IMAGES , LIKE THEY USE TO SELL POPCORN AT THE MOVIES . BOTH RUSSIAN AND AMERICAN SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM FOR DECADES . - NOT TO MENTION MADISON AVENUE . - THE NAKED LADY IN THE ICE CUBE . - AH , ONE OF MY PERSONAL FAVORITES . - WHY WASN 'T I AFFECTED ? THAT 'S THE ONE THING WE HAVEN 'T FIGURED OUT YET . THIS , UH , SUBLIMINAL SIGNAL- - COULD COLOR BE A FACTOR IN IT ? - MAYBE . - I 'M RED-GREEN COLOR BLIND . HIS INABILITY TO PERCEIVE THE COLOR RED COULD RENDER HIM IMMUNE TO PSYCHOTROPIC EFFECTS . [ Phone Ringing ] BUT WHY DESIGN A COLOR-DEPENDENT SIGNAL ? WHY NOT ? RED-GREEN COLORBLIND- - MULDER . THAT 'S ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE MALE POPULATION . WHICH STILL LEAVES THE VAST MAJORITY VULNERABLE TO ITS EFFECTS . - I 'LL BE RIGHT THERE . - WHAT HAPPENED ? MARYLAND STATE POLICE . THEY THINK THEY 'VE FOUND SCULLY . IS SHE OKAY ? NO , UM- - THEY THINK MAYBE I SHOULD COME DOWN AND I.D. THE BODY . [ Tires Screeching ] GET IN . - I CAN 'T TALK TO YOU RIGHT NOW . - THEY 'RE WATCHING YOU . GET IN BEFORE YOU GET US BOTH KILLED . THAT 'S AN INTERESTING CHOICE OF WORDS . MY PARTNER MAY BE DEAD . - THAT 'S NOT MY CONCERN . - THE HELL IT ISN 'T ! WE 'RE HERE BECAUSE OF YOU ! - KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN . - WHO ARE YOU ? WHO DO YOU WORK FOR ? WE 'RE WASTING TIME . WHILE YOU 'RE CHASING YOUR PARTNER , THEY 'RE DESTROYING THE EVIDENCE . - WHO ? - JUST FOLLOW THE EVIDENCE . IF YOU DON 'T , BY TOMORROW THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WILL BE OUT OF YOUR REACH . A STATE HIGHWAY PATROLMAN FOUND THE BODY ... OFF A RURAL HIGHWAY AT APPROXIMATELY 2 : 00 P.M. NUDE , SHOT IN THE FOREHEAD . ARE YOU READY ? LET ME DO THAT . IT 'S NOT HER . SOMEBODY HAS TO CALL HER MOTHER . WE ALREADY TRIED . WE WEREN 'T ABLE TO REACH HER . SHE 'S NOT ANSWERING HER PHONE ? - MRS. SCULLY . IS SHE HERE ? - UH , NO . YOU HAVEN 'T BEEN ANSWERING YOUR PHONE . - WHEN I HEAR FROM HER , I 'LL CALL YOU , OKAY ? - I NEED TO SEE HER . FOX , PLEASE . GO AWAY . GO AWAY ! WHERE IS SHE ? DANA , PUT DOWN THE GUN ! I 'M HERE TO HELP YOU , SCULLY . I TOLD YOU , MOM . HE 'S HERE TO KILL ME . - I 'M ON YOUR SIDE . YOU KNOW THAT . - PUT IT DOWN , DANA . SCULLY , LISTEN TO ME VERY CAREFULLY . YOU DON 'T KNOW IT , BUT YOU 'RE SICK WITH THE SAME THING THAT DROVE THOSE OTHER PEOPLE TO MURDER . - AND WHATEVER YOU THINK MAY BE HAPPENING- - - JUST STEP BACK . DANA , YOU 'RE NOT YOURSELF . HE 'S TELLING YOU THE TRUTH . IT 'S NOT THE TRUTH , MOM . HE 'S LIED TO ME FROM THE BEGINNING . HE NEVER TRUSTED ME . SCULLY , YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE I TRUST . YOU 'RE IN ON IT . YOU 'RE ONE OF THEM . YOU 'RE ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ABDUCTED ME . YOU PUT THAT THING IN MY NECK ! YOU KILLED MY SISTER ! - THAT 'S NOT TRUE , DANA . - IT IS . - I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO ME . - MOM , JUST GET OUT OF THE WAY ! YOU TRUST ME , DON 'T YOU ? YOU KNOW THAT I WOULD NEVER HURT YOU . THAT I WOULD NEVER LET ANYBODY HURT YOU . THAT 'S WHY YOU CAME HERE , ISN 'T IT ? YOU 'RE SAFE HERE . PUT THE GUN DOWN , DANA . PUT IT DOWN . [ Crying ] [ Woman On P.A. ] DR. MONSIGNOR . [ Knock At Door ] [ Newscaster , Indistinct ] HOW ARE YOU FEELING ? ASHAMED . I WAS SO SURE , MULDER . I SAW THINGS , AND I HEARD THINGS . AND IT WAS JUST LIKE THE WORLD WAS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN . EVERYBODY WAS OUT TO GET ME . NOW YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL MOST OF THE TIME . I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA KILL ME . I 'M NOT SURPRISED . I DID SOME CHECKING . JOSEPH PATNIK THOUGHT HE WAS MURDERING A BOSNIAN WAR CRIMINAL , A MAN THE MEDIA DESCRIBED AS A MODERN DAY HITLER . IT TURNS OUT BOTH PATNIK 'S PARENTS WERE HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS . I 'M NOT FOLLOWING . HELENE RIDDOCK WAS SCARED ... THAT HER HUSBAND WAS GONNA BE UNFAITHFUL TO HER . YOU SEE A PATTERN DEVELOPING ? WHAT IF THIS VIDEO SIGNAL ... SOMEHOW TURNED THESE PEOPLE 'S ANXIETIES INTO SOME KIND OF DEMENTIA ? A VIRTUAL REALITY OF THEIR OWN WORST NIGHTMARES . LIKE ME THINKING THAT YOU 'D BETRAY ME . I WAS SO FAR GONE , MULDER , I THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE GONE TO THE OTHER SIDE . WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? THAT CANCER MAN , THAT MAN WHO SMOKES ALL THOSE CIGARETTES . I WAS SURE THAT I SAW THE TWO OF YOU SITTING IN YOUR CAR IN THE MOTEL PARKING LOT . YOU WERE REPORTING TO HIM . YOU HANDED HIM A VIDEOTAPE . IT ... IT WAS CRAZY . WELL , MAYBE NOT . WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? WELL , SOMEBODY 'S BEHIND THIS . WE JUST DON 'T KNOW WHO . YOU THINK IT COULD BE HIM ? I DON 'T KNOW . WHY DON 'T YOU TRY TO GET SOME REST ? DR. LORENZ ? AGENT MULDER . I WAS JUST ABOUT TO CHECK IN ON YOUR PARTNER . WHAT COURSE OF TREATMENT HAVE YOU OUTLINED FOR AGENT SCULLY ? AT THIS POINT , NOTHING MORE THAN BED REST . WE STILL HAVEN 'T BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT BROUGHT THIS ON . AS FAR AS I CAN TELL , THERE 'S NOTHING MEDICALLY WRONG WITH HER . WELL , THAT DIDN 'T SEEM TO BE THE CASE LAST NIGHT . NO , IT WASN 'T . IT 'S GOT ME PUZZLED . HER M.R.I. WAS NEGATIVE , BUT THE SPINAL TAP REVEALED HIGH LEVELS OF SEROTONIN IN HER BRAIN . DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR HER STRANGE BEHAVIOR ? HIGH SEROTONIN LEVELS HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH MANIA . BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS , AS OF THIS AFTERNOON , HER LEVELS ARE PRETTY MUCH BACK TO NORMAL . DR. LORENZ , UH , WOULD YOU HAVE MADE A DIAGNOSIS OF AMPHETAMINE ABUSE FOR SOMEONE IN AGENT SCULLY 'S CONDITION ? NOT GIVEN HER SEROTONIN LEVELS . NO , THAT WOULDN 'T MAKE ANY SENSE . THANK YOU . [ Phone Dialing , Ringing ] BRADDOCK HEIGHTS . YEAH , I NEED THE NUMBER FOR THE FREDERICK COUNTY PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL . [ Phone Ringing ] WARD THREE . THIS IS FOX MULDER WITH THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION . I NEED TO TALK TO DR. STROMAN , PLEASE . I 'M SORRY . DR. STROMAN IS NO LONGER HERE . I BELIEVE HE 'S RETURNED TO WASHINGTON . - KNOW WHERE I CAN REACH HIM ? - I 'M NOT SURE . HE LEFT US A LOCAL NUMBER . IT 'S AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE . - IS IT 555-0135 ? - THAT 'S IT . THANK YOU . YOU WANT ME TO GO FIRST THIS TIME ? DAMN STRAIGHT . I HAVEN 'T HAD A CHANCE TO CLEAN THE ROOM YET . HE JUST CHECKED OUT . BUT WITH ALL THE EXCITEMENT , I DON 'T BLAME HIM . DO YOU CHARGE FOR LOCAL CALLS ? OF COURSE . - THEN YOU 'D HAVE A RECORD OF ALL CALLS MADE FROM HERE ? - I 'LL GET IT . THANK YOU . HERE YOU GO . THANKS . THANK YOU . HEY , DANNY . IT 'S MULDER . I NEED YOU TO CHECK A NUMBER FOR ME . THAT 'S WHAT HE TOLD ME , STROMAN . THEN WHERE IS HE ? - HE SAID HE 'D BE HERE . - HE 'LL BE HERE . IT 'S ALMOST 7 : 00 . I CAN 'T WAIT ANY LONGER . THERE 'S NO SIGN OF HIM ! [ Gunshots ] YOU 'RE TOO LATE , AGENT MULDER . NOW THAT YOU 'VE DESTROYED ALL THE EVIDENCE . YOU WERE TOLD THIS WOULD HAPPEN . YOU MADE YOUR CHOICE . I JUST DIDN 'T KNOW I WAS WORKING FOR YOU . I HAD NO ALTERNATIVE . I WAS BEING WATCHED TOO CLOSELY . I COULDN 'T RISK COMPROMISING MYSELF . - WHY KILL THEM IF YOU WANTED ME TO EXPOSE THEM ? - THOSE WERE ALWAYS MY ORDERS . I WAS JUST HOPING YOU 'D GET TO THEM FIRST . AND UNCOVER WHAT ? WHAT WERE THEY TRYING TO DO ? MANIPULATE PEOPLE 'S BEHAVIOR ? ALTER THEIR DECISION-MAKING PROCESS ? WHAT TO BUY ? WHO TO VOTE FOR ? YOU THINK THEY 'LL STOP AT COMMERCE AND POLITICS ? WHERE WILL THEY STOP ? THAT 'S WHERE YOU FAILED , AGENT MULDER . DON 'T LAY THIS OFF ON ME . YOU PULLED ME INTO THIS SITUATION ... BECAUSE YOU DIDN 'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO REVEAL THE TRUTH YOURSELF . FEEL BETTER NOW ? YOU 'RE A COWARD ! YOU WORK IN THE SHADOWS . YOU FEED ME SCRAPS , HOPING THAT I COULD PIECE IT TOGETHER . YOU 'VE MADE ME RISK MY LIFE , YOU 'VE RISKED MY PARTNER 'S LIFE ... AND YOU NEVER RISK YOUR OWN ! YOU 'RE NOT WALKING AWAY FROM THIS . YOU 'RERISKING YOUR LIFE RIGHT NOW . YOU FAILED . THIS IS YOUR SUCCESS ? KILLING ME ? THE TRUTH IS , YOU NEED ME , AGENT MULDER . [ Sirens Wailing In Distance ] THIS IS YOUR FINAL REPORT , AGENT MULDER ? YES , SIR . I SEE MORE QUESTIONS HERE THAN I DO ANSWERS . YOU DON 'T KNOW WHO MANUFACTURED THE DEVICE YOU FOUND OR WHAT ITS PURPOSE WAS . NO , SIR . [ Knock At Door ] - AGENT SCULLY , WELCOME BACK . - I 'M SORRY I 'M LATE . I JUST GOT BACK FROM THE DOCUMENTS SECTION . WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THE TWO MEN MULDER FOUND EXECUTED ? THE CABLE COMPANY EMPLOYEE HAD NO CRIMINAL RECORD . IN FACT , THERE WAS NOTHING REMARKABLE ABOUT HIM WHATSOEVER . WE FOUND A MEDICAL LICENSE UNDER THE NAME " DR. HENRY STROMAN " ... IN FALLS CHURCH , VIRGINIA . HE DIED IN 1978 . WHAT ABOUT THEIR KILLER ? HE REMAINS AN UNKNOWN SUBJECT . HAVE YOU COMPLETED YOUR WORK ? ALL THE PERSONNEL AND HARDWARE HAVE BEEN REMOVED . BUT MULDER STILL HAS ONE OF THE DEVICES . WELL , IT PROVES NOTHING . WHAT ABOUT , UH , MULDER 'S SOURCE ? HE 'S BEEN ELIMINATED . AND HIS SOURCE ? WHO 'S HE WORKING WITH ? THAT PERSON REMAINS UNKNOWN . CLOSED-CAPTIONED BY CAPTIONS , INC .

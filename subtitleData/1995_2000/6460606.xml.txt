 It 's just a passport photo , not the cover of Vogue . There 's no reason I have to look like hell in it , is there ? Settle down . - We 're on a schedule here . - I know we 're on a schedule here . Act natural . - I 'll be back in ten . - Make it five . I 'll be around back . Relax , Billy . Lower itjust a bit . Yeah , that 's it . Now , big smile . Yeah , hold it . - Big trip you got planned ? - Oh , you know , nothin ' special . Just good to have a passport . It looks like it 's clearing up . Might be a nice day after all . It 's just gonna take a few minutes . That comes to $ 6.95 . Great . I left my money in the car . - I 'll be back . - I 'll be here . Ow ! Hey , you jerk ! What ? Billy ? Billy , someone did something to me . Billy ? Shoot . My God ! What are your thoughts , Scully ? Have the local police been contacted by her abductor ? - No demand for ransom ? - No , unfortunately . It 's going on three days . Any additional leads ? No . No hair and fiber evidence . The rain washed it all away . The autopsy came back on the dead boyfriend . A puncture wound through the eardrum and into the brain , possibly from a long needle or an awl . I 'm still not sure how we figure into this investigation . Did you see the photo ? I assume that was taken by her abductor . It was taken by a 65-year-old druggist moments before she was abducted . That 's a passport photo from a local drugstore . The druggist was the last known person to have seen Mary Lefante . He claims that wasn 't the photo he was taking . He says the photo he was taking was normal . He only came to the police when he heard she was missing . Well , whoever took this photo was obviously privy to the woman 's abduction . That is what you would think . It 's the damnedest thing . Here it is , just like I left it . It was under lock and key . - Is that where you keep it ? - Yeah . - Mind if I take a look ? - Please , help yourself . At first I thought I did something wrong when I took the picture . There 's that piece of paper you have to pull off . You have to do thatjust right . I 'm sure you did itjust fine . - Your film 's out of date . - Is that against the law ? - No . I was just making an observation . - I don 't get much call for passport photos . The copy shop over at the mall does ' em cheaper . Excuse me . I sure hope you find that young woman safe and sound . Which one of us gets to use the stun gun on Bruno Hauptmann back there ? So he doesn 't exactly stand out as a suspect . Mulder , take a look at this . You see this smeariness here ? I 'm thinking it 's heat damage . With the heater sitting under the film , the emulsion probably melted . That would make it look like she posed screaming for a passport photo ? Plus , the film is two years out of date . The photographic chemistry could 've changed . The dyes ... fade , they ... - All right , so what 's your theory ? - I 'm not sure I have a theory . - Excuse me . You the two FBI agents ? - Agents Mulder and Scully . Sorry to have brought you all this way . I 'm afraid we might have wasted your time . Hey , Trott . Inspector Puett , these are Agents Scully and Mulder . - Agents . - Inspector . US postal inspector . My office is investigating a mail theft ... .. which we 've traced to your missing person , Ms Mary Louise Lefante . She was a postal employee . A sorter at the Kurland Hills branch . A number of unsigned credit cards in transit through that branch never made it to their respective owners . She was intercepting them ? And her boyfriend was signing them . We ran him . He was into forgery , check fraud . Mary Lefante 's passport photo . Do you know how soon she wanted to leave town ? - Did she know about your investigation ? - Probably . Though we didn 't focus on her specifically until after she came up missing . - You think she faked her disappearance ? - Looks that way to me . Yeah , but why would she stab her boyfriend through the ear ? The magic was gone ? Did you find a camera anywhere here ? You think this woman planted that photo of herself in the drugstore ? - What would be the point of that ? - I ... Here it is . Stand back , Scully . It 's loaded . - What are you doing ? - In the ' 60s a bellhop named Ted Serios became famous for taking what he called \ x22thoughtographs \ x22 . He claimed that by concentrating on an unexposed negative he could create a photographic representation of what he saw in his mind . He did landscapes , cathedrals , the Queen of England ... - Thoughtographs . - Also known as scotographs . Literature on thought photography dates back almost to Louis Daguerre . So that makes it legitimate ? Look at that . Oh , my God ! - I think he was here , Scully . - Who was here ? Mary Lefante 's abductor . I think he stalked her . He could have come up right here . I think he came in here and looked at her through the window , this close . Close enough to affect the camera film . Psychic photography ? Mulder , it 's obvious that somebody doctored these images and planted them to be found here . Maybe as some kind of a smoke screen . To conceal what ? This isn 't about mail fraud . That 's just incidental . What if ... What if someone had this ability ? An image like this would be a peek into that person 's mind . - Into their darkest fantasies ? - The fantasy of a killer . She 's completely non-responsive . We did a tox screen and found traces of morphine and scopolamine . - Twilite Sleep . - The dental anesthetic ? A painkiller cocktail . It 's also for women in labor . - Would that account for her condition ? - No . What would ? Give her a PET scan . All set . Oh , my God ! What is it ? She 's been given a transorbital lobotomy . It used to be known as an ice-pick lobotomy . It involves inserting a leucotome through the eye sockets . We 're looking for a doctor ? Someone with training ? - Notjudging by this . - Whoever did this , Mulder , did it wrong . Un ... Un ... Unruhe . Unruhe . - Mary . - Un ... Un ... You 'd better go in there and get her . Unruhe . Unruhe . Unruhe . We just got the call . There 's been a second abduction . Unruhe . You can roll . We 're set here . Get that area taped off . Watch it . Excuse me , ma 'am . - Mulder ? - Charles Selchik , certified public accountant . Dead from a stab wound through the ear . Cleaning crew found the body . - What about the missing woman ? - His secretary , Alice Brandt , age 32 . The family says she was working late last night . - What 's her connection to the first victim ? - Apparently none . But the MO is the same . - Yeah . The clock is running . - Yeah . I keep thinking about what Mary Lefante was repeating : \ x22unruhe . \ x22 The Michigan phone book has three different spellings , but none within 80 miles of here . It might be significant as a word . That 's what I 've been thinking . In German it means \ x22trouble \ x22 or \ x22strife . \ x22 - Unrest . - You took German in high school , Scully ? - College . - Unrest , huh ? I 'm working on these crime-scene photos from the first abduction . If we 're lucky , the abductor gets a thrill from returning to the scene of a crime . He wasn 't there , Scully . - How do you know ? - It would 've affected the photos . - Trott , what did you find ? - Nothing much . There 's no cameras or film here whatsoever . It 's all just accountants ' offices , so I don 't know why there would be . Is that what we 're looking for ? Evidence of psychic photography ? It may be the only evidence we get . I 've got a forensics team coming from Detroit . What 's here for them to find ? This guy 's very good at what he does . He 's left no witnesses , no latent prints ... Only those photos , which makes me believe he doesn 't know he has that ability . We haven 't found any new psychic photos here either . Wait a second . I wanna show you something . Right here . This . And look . It 's the same company . What if the kidnapper was working construction at both sites ? He would 've been able to pick out the two women . - Check it out . Let me know what you find . - Where are you gonna be ? Back in DC . I want Special Photo to run this . I still think the answer 's in here . What if it 's not ? This woman 's time is running out . All the more reason to fully investigate the one hard piece of evidence we do have . I 'll be in touch . Get away from me ! Get away from me , you bastard ! Let me go ... Can you get rid of the blurriness here ? Yeah . I just need to mark a place where the blur comes to a point and let the computer do its business . Bingo . Lord , look at that ! - This guy 's an artist . - Why do you say that ? However he did this , however he put this together , it 's seamless . What about this face ? Can you bring that up ? Wait a second . Let 's try . - I think I can sweeten it more . - OK , do that . What have you got ? From the construction company employees , 18 workers overlapped on both job sites . - We 're checking , but so far nothing . - What about day laborers ? Mr Iskendarian there doesn 't hire workers off the books . I don 't want IRS trouble . But his foreman might hire cash-only day labor without his knowledge . He 's got seven job sites going now , as many foremen . Gather officers to canvass . Which foreman works the Midlothian Corporate Park ? - Thatjob 's finished . - Find out where he is today . I 'll take that one . Can I use your phone ? OK , thank you . NCIC shows no match for that man . What about this shape up here ? What is that ? Can you take that and flip it so that that 's on the bottom ? Is that a shadow ? Yeah . It is . It 's somebody 's shadow . It 's the kidnapper 's shadow . It 's like he 's looming over her . It 's like he ... he 's standing over her . He means to pass judgment on her , like a god . Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Hi . Can I help you ? I hope so . Are you the foreman ? - Yes , ma 'am . I 'm Gerry Schnauz . - I 'm Special Agent Dana Scully . I 'd like to ask you some questions about the day laborers you hire . - What , is this some IRS thing or ... - No , sir , not at all . My crew 's at lunch if you want to talk to anybody , but everybody I 've got on today is on the books , as far as I know . - Excuse me . Sorry . - Yeah , sure . - Scullly . - I may have something for you on the kidnapper . It 's - something about his legs . - Yeah ? They 're unusually long . They 're out of proportion . I 'm thinking he 's either very tall , or he 's not , but wants to be . Scully ? Scully , are you there ? Unruhe . Stand where you are ! Don 't move ! Stop or I 'll shoot ! Lace your fingers behind your head . Do it ! - Who ? - Alice Brandt . The second woman that you abducted . That 's her name , Gerry . Where is Alice Brandt ? I don 't ... I have no earthly idea what you 're talking about . Tell us where she is , Gerry . I 'm sorry . This is a case of mistaken identity or something . I honestly , honestly have no idea what you 're talking about . Explain this . We 're running Sheetrock . I use that to start the holes in it to keyhole in all the fixtures . - No . You used this to kill the two men . - What two men ? You used this on Mary Lefante ! Who ? Wait . A minute ago it was Alice Brandt . I don 't believe this . I do not believe this is happening . You want to tell us about the first time you were arrested , Gerry ? In 1980 you attacked your father with an ax handle . You beat him so severely that he spent the remainder of his life in a wheelchair . I was notjailed . I was institutionalized . I had a kind of chemical imbalance . Yeah . \ x22Gerald Schnauz , treated for a paranoid schizophrenic disorder . \ x22 \ x22Six years in Melvoyne Psychiatric Hospital . Released 1986 . \ x22 So what you been up to since 1986 , Gerry ? Taking care of my father . Looking after him 24 hours a day . Making amends . He passed away in January . How did you feel about that ? Sad . It says here you have a sister . Where is your sister , Gerry ? She passed . Actually , it says here she committed suicide In 1980 . God , that was a bad year . What else happened In 1980 , Gerry ? Well , John Lennon got shot . Where are you going with this ? Are you Sigmund Freud ? - Why don 't you cut the BS ? - Why don 't we get back to Alice Brandt ? Where is she ? You look troubled . Hey , Gerry ? This your father ? - Where 'd you get that ? - You left that for me . Left it like a fingerprint . Is this what you see when you close your eyes , Gerry ? Is that what you see ? Gerry , tell me where Alice Brandt is . She 's safe ... from the howlers . She 's all right now . Gerry , tell me how I can find her . Over here ! Right up ahead . Scully , that word unruhe , unrest - it 's bothering me . Maybe he thought he was curing them . Saving them from damnation . From those things in the pictures . He called them \ x22the howlers . \ x22 It 's over , Mulder . Then that photo wouldn 't be his fantasy . It would be his nightmare . What the hell does it matter ? - Because I wanna know . - I don 't . OK , Gerry . Put it all in here . Wallet , jewelry , everything . Eyes straight ahead . Let 's step over to the table . What the ... ? Mulder . This wound 's in the wrong place . He was shot in the throat . He wasn 't trying to save this victim . We just got a report of a robbery at the drugstore where the first victim disappeared . What happened ? Thank you . It was Gerry . He took the passport camera and all the film . And morphine , scopolamine hydrobromide and insulin syringes . - He 's making more Twilite Sleep . - He wants to continue his work . You know thatjob site that I arrested him at , Mulder ? What if he 's picked out his next victim ? There were apartment buildings on all sides . You think you interrupted his stalking ? Let 's go . Hold on a second . Bring the car around . I just wanna wait for this . I 'll be right there . - Corning . - Corning . Send units to Belmont Avenue . Check all the apartments near thatjob site . I think he 's heading back there . - Got it . - Thanks . Ow ! Scully ! Scully ! Scully ! Sir ? Agent Scully 's Explorerjust turned up at a park and ride about 20 miles up the US 81 . - Any sightings ? - A report of an Audi stolen from the same lot . He 's switching cars . He 's gonna do that two or three times . He 's got six fingers here . Sir ? He 's got six fingers . What about his apartment ? We got a unit there . But he ain 't comin ' back . What about friends , coworkers ? Does he have a summerhouse ? He doesn 't have much of anything . We 're running some phone numbers from his wallet ... Let me see his wallet . It 's his father 's obituary . \ x22Recipient of the Bronze Star Medal during the Korean War . \ x22 \ x22Gerald Schnauz Sr , DDS . \ x22 He was a retired dentist . He was here . Why would he take the chair ? Let me go . It 's over , Gerry . Let me go right now . Yes , you do . Everybody does . But especially you . Why ? Why me , Gerry ? Do I remind you of your sister ? Why did your sister kill herself , Gerry ? What did your father do to her ? He didn 't do anything . It was the howlers . OK . Then let 's talk about the howlers . They live inside your head . They make you do things and say things that you don 't mean . And all your good thoughts can 't wish them away . You need help . You 've got them right there . Don 't you feel them ? - I don 't have them , Gerry . - See ? They made you say thatjust now because they know I 'm going to kill them . What if you 're wrong , Gerry ? What if there are no such things as howlers ? What if you made them up inside your head to explain the things your sister said your father did ? Great . Now they got you talking like Sigmund Freud . I am on to you ! I know your tricks ! Besides , I 've seen them in that picture that your partner showed me . Pictures don 't lie . You saw them too . If there are such things as howlers , Gerry , ... they live only inside your head . Six fingers , right ? - We 've got the state police ... - Why are there six ? What ? We 've got the state police looking as far south as Grand Rapids . Still no sign of her . - Agent Mulder , what do we do ? - Damn it . One , two ... There 's five headstones . And the father makes six . Come on ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Fan out ! Check the tree line ! What does ... What does this mean ? It means you need help , Gerry . No , I think what it means is that I don 't have much time left . No , Gerry , stop ! Scully ! Mulder ! In here ! Mulder , help ! Mulder ! Scully ! - Are you hurt ? - No . Get an ambulance ! Addendum to case report . After his death , a diary was found among Gerald Schnauz 's belongings , written in the second person and apparently intended as an open letter to his father . It includes the names of his victims . The women he desired to save . My name is contained in the last entry . I have no further explanation for the existence of the photographs , nor am I confident one is forthcoming . My captivity forced me to understand and even empathize with Gerry Schnauz . My survival depended on it . I see now the value of such insight . For truly to pursue monsters , we must understand them , we must venture into their minds . Only , in doing so , do we risk letting them venture into ours ?

 Good morning , all ! Good morning . Good morning . Hey , you 're wearing your lucky tie . What 's the occasion ? Oh , no occasion , really . This hotshot visiting professor , Dr. Neesam , arrives today . The Dean asked me to show him around , so I want to look my best , just to let him know that he 's on my turf . Why don 't you just drop your pants and spray all the corners ? That 's what cats do . They do ? I 'll think about it . Well , whatever you do , come back early . I need the car tonight . I got a date , all right ? Ooh , Sally . About that , he called . He 's not coming . What ? Why ? ! He said he 's afraid of you . Was it the death grip ? Dick , how are you supposed to teach a guy the death grip if you don 't put him in the death grip ? [ Mocking ] Ooh ! I 'm afraid of the death grip ! And this is the door . Coat rack , fireplace , files , and last but not least , my desk . Dr. Neesam ? I can 't believe they just leave these out in the hall for the taking . Oh , you 're telling me . Nina ! Yes ? Could you bring Dr. Neesam and me a cup of coffee ? Oh , yes , of course . Dr. Neesam , how do you like it ? Any way you 'd like to give it to me . How about hot and in your lap ? [ Muttering ] I 'll give it to you . Is she coming on to me ? I can never tell . It 's best to ignore it . So , Dr. Neesam , what has brought you to Pendleton ? A plane . It was absolutely dreadful . I know what you mean . Your fate is in the hands of a couple of doormen and a uniformed waitress . And the endless pointing . Oh , god , yes ! They point to where the door is . And you only just came through it . Exactly . If the plane lands in the water , my flotation device will be the person next to me . Dr. Neesam , I find you pompous , judgmental , and completely self-Absorbed . Would you be my friend ? We 'll see . Excuse me . I 'm looking for Dr. Dick Solomon . Ah , Dr. Neesam . He should be back any minute . You 're welcome to sit and wait . Oh , thank you . Would you get me a cup of coffee ? Don 't you remember ? We met . I 'm Dr. Mary Albright . Ahh ! Dr. Mary Albright . Would you get me a cup of coffee ? I don 't think Dr. Solomon would appreciate you rummaging through his desk . I thought I sent you out for coffee . I am Dr. Mary Albright , Ph.D. , Professor of anthropology ! You know , your cheeks turn a beautiful pink when you 're yelling . It complements the crystal blue of your eyes , and it comes together in your moon pie of a face . I beg your pardon ? ! You have the head of a cookie . I want to eat you ! You stay away ! First a lick , then a bite . Ah , Liam , there you are ! Good ! I see you two have broken the ice . What do you say we all go out tonight and get to know each other better , hmm ? Good idea . Dick , I 'm not sure about this guy . He doesn 't even know me , and he chased me around the room ! He did ? Well , Mary , I barely knew you the first time I chased you . It 's just what you bring out in men . Yeah ? She 's in ! Your turn . Wow ! 3 bull 's eyes in a row . You are good ! Actually , I 'm a bit off tonight . I wish I could do that . Oh , Mary ! You throw like a girl . Oh , don 't be silly . Anyone can learn . Come here . Come here . Right . Now , hold that . Tip it up a little bit . Ease back , big breath , relax , follow through . Whoo ! It hit the board ! I 've never done that ! Oh ! Yes . Good girl . Dick , Sally and Harry won 't buy me a beer . Harry , Sally , don 't be so cheap ! I 'd like to introduce you to my family . Ah , yes . The dim-witted brother and the surly adolescent . Oh , well , he 's sure got us pegged . This is my sister Sally . You 're in luck . She 's available . Really ? A woman as beautiful as you , available ? Oh . You must have a severe personality disorder . Wow ! This guy 's amazing . Mary : Dick , your turn . Personality disorder . I 'm gonna go kick his ass ! Don : there you go , princess . Don . Sally ? What are you doing here ? Um , uh ... I , um , we got a report about some south American gunrunners working out of the back room . But you 're not in uniform . Well , yeah . I 'm ... . undercover . That just makes my story all the more believable . Well , I 'm glad you 're here . I could use some company tonight . You see , um ... I thought maybe we could sit down and order some chicken wings , and you could tell me I 'm pretty . Hi , Donnie . You were great last night ! Who was that ? I gotta go . Dick : and for shorter distances , compared to a wavelength , we know that e-w equals one over r-cubed and- - hello , Liam . Can I help you ? No , but I can help you . This is rather puzzling . You have 5 unnecessary terms . Now , now , Dr. Neesam . This is my class . Yes , but you see , here ... and , uh , here ... brackets here , of course . Now , these terms are all equal and self-nullifying . VOILà ! But that doesn 't work . Yes , it does . No , it doesn 't . Yes , it does . Oh ! Dear god , I understand that ! Yes ! Sweet mother ! For the first time in my life , I see how something works ! Oh , shut up , Leon ! Now , listen to me , officer . I need to reach Don Orville . Of course you haven 't seen him ! He 's undercover , you idiot ! Sally . Sally , we have company . You remember Larry from night school ? How you doin ' ? Not too bad . So ... you like movies ? Kinda . You know , um , Sally likes spaghetti . So do I. Larry 's got a car . I like cars . Ah , well , we have a match ! Sorry , man . We had a deal ! Damn . 2 feet short . Huh . That means I 've got to putt it in . [ Air horn blows ] Well , what ? What was that ? What ? That noise . What noise ? I don 't recall a noise . Maybe a bird ... a small rodent . Perhaps you have a brain tumor . [ Toot ] What was that ? Oh , this ? Um , it 's an experiment . I wanted to see how you 'd react . I am a biologist , you know . Are you going to do it again ? Probably not . Oh . Bad luck . Oh . Better luck on the next hole . [ Toot ] Oh , I got it . All right . How about that guy from the newsstand ? Oh , Frank deegan ! Well , how about him , Sally ? He seems presentable . No . Come on , Sally . He lives on a houseboat . It 's on his mother 's lawn ! I don 't need a date , you guys . If you really want to help me , help me figure out what the problem is with Don . Oh , I 'll tell you how to solve any kind of love problem . Now , what you do is you invite him in for a little casual breakfast , and when he 's walkin ' in , you 're fryin ' the eggs ... in the buff . Ooh , I 'd like to see that . No . You 're not there . What ? So we don 't get any breakfast ? Go get a doughnut . Wait , wait . Hold up . Doesn 't the grease splatter all over your boobs ? Doughnuts aren 't breakfast . No . Eggs are breakfast . You know what 's good for breakfast ? Shut up ! Talk ! If you want to find out what 's up with Don , why don 't you try the old-fashioned method ? What do you mean , like , stalk him ? No ! Disguise yourself and follow him around . I 'll set the table . Oh , I 'll help . No , no . Mary 'd prefer it done right . Mary , I don 't want you to invite him over anymore ! Dick , you don 't own me . I can invite whomever I please . Fine , but I don 't like him ! Well , you don 't have to ! I don 't ! So , what 's for dinner ? Baked new england lobster . Mmm ! Sounds yummy . Liam 's making it . Oh ! Damn ! Don 't touch it . I 'll get it . [ Ding ] How did he do that ? Isn 't that hot ? Oh , very , yes . Aah ! Ice ? What are these ? Escargot foie gras champignon à la grecque en croute . Do try one . Oh ! This is the best thing I have ever put in my mouth ! Once again , I come in second . Dick , try one of these . Oh , no . I 'm really not hungry . Although they do smell awfully good . Isn 't that terrific ? Yes . Mm-hmm . Mary , would you put the salad out , please ? Oh ! The salad looks perfect . Thank you . So , Dick , you don 't really cook , then ? Me ? I 'm an excellent cook , but I don 't do it in front of Mary because she doesn 't like me to do , uh- - how can I put this ? Womany things . Ah . I enjoy cooking out of doors , of course , along with other manly men , but in the confines of a kitchen , I find that real men tend to eschew such girlie pursuits . Quite . Where 's Dick ? Our game tired him out . He 's having a nap . Oh . Whoops ! Dropped the ladle . Oh , I 'll get it . I wish you wouldn 't do that . Why ? Didn 't I do it well enough ? As a matter of fact , you did it perfectly . But it 's just that I 'm kind of involved right now . I mean , not officially , but I 'm- - ah , Mary 's afraid . Mary doesn 't want to rock the boat in her little life . She doesn 't want to lose control and be swept away in a torrent of pleasure . Dick : Mary ? Where 's Don Orville ? I saw him come in here . Don Orville ? Don 't play games with me , babe . I saw you talk to him the other night . You mean Donnie orvellini ? Donnie orvellini ! Aah ! Aah !

Where is he ? He 's gone . I 'm glad you threw him out . Well , he left . Oh . How long have I been out ? Oh , I don 't know . What ? 10 minutes ? 30 minutes ? Oh , I don 't know . I took off my watch . You only take your watch off when we- - oh , Mary , no ! Oh , I 'm sorry . How could you ? ! I don 't know why I did it . You know how he is . Oh , I can 't stand it ! He 's beaten me again ! Have you noticed how good he is at everything ? Oh-ho , yeah . I mean , yeah . No wonder you couldn 't resist him . He 's just like me to the 10th degree . Yes ! That 's why I did it ! He 's exactly like you ! I know ! We 're both brilliant . We 're both gorgeous . We 're both ... oh , my god , of course . We 're both- - aah ! Well , that was easy . So he was good ? Oh , he was good . He was panty-throwing good . Then why are you worried ? At least it 's not another woman , right ? I know , but you should have seen all these women staring at him . He is a karaoke star , Tommy . They just don 't get any bigger than that . I left him a message . I sure hope he calls . Oh , well , don 't worry , Sally , 'cause we 'll be your dates . Yeah . Me and Harry . How 'd you like that ? Yeah . I 'm gonna fry you up some eggs . Don : Sally ! Oh , it 's Don ! Get lost . I got your message . I 'm so glad you came , Don , or should I say , " Donnie orvellini " ? So you know . Yes , I know . Why didn 't you tell me ? I didn 't think you 'd understand , Sally . Cops ... they don 't sing . I thought you were with another woman . Sally , music is my lady . Oh , Don , I want to be with you and that lady . Sing for me .

Uh , taking a few things . Those are my theories on the earth 's gravitational alignment . Yes , and some of them are quite good , and that 's why I 'm taking them , just to prove something to the folks at home . You don 't need those theories . You can figure them out . You can figure everything out , and I think I know why . All right , let 's hear it . Why ? You 're an alien . Oh , Dick , well done . I knew it ! Dick , you are quite a remarkable human creature . Oh ! Well , I agree with the remarkable part . After all , I figured out who you are , but you , my friend , have missed something glaringly obvious about me . Care to guess ? No . You see , I came to this planet for only one purpose : to destroy it . What ? Oh , yes . Big explosion , chunks of debris , things flying every which way , then a second explosion , not quite as huge as the first one , but still very big and sparkly , something to see . Only , of course , you wouldn 't because you 'd have been vaporized in the first one . But why the earth ? Because you 're blocking our view ! I won 't let you ! No , no . Let me explain . When I first came to this planet , I looked around for signs of intelligence , but nothing much , certainly nothing to justify not blowing it up , then ... then , Dick , I met you . Ah , yes , me . Well , there 's a reason why you were so impressed . You see , I 'm not from Ohio . You see , Dick , you proved to me that human beings can be bright in a sort of look-what - my-2 - Year-old-can-do sort of way . That 's because- - that is , if for 2 minutes they can get their minds off large-breasted lifeguards , coffee cake that doesn 't make you fat , and Celine Dion . Somebody tell her to stop . The boat sank . Let it go . I 'm not quite following . Dick , you and you alone have convinced me to spare your kind . Me ? Mm-hmm . Me ? Mm-hmm . Oh , I see . Now , what is this thing that 's so important about you that I simply have to know it ? What ? Hmm ? Oh ! Oh , that . Yes . Well , I 'm , uh- - I 'm an--an- - I 'm A ... Canadian . I 'm so sorry . Nevertheless , I 'm going to do something that I hoped I wouldn 't have to do . Well , we can 't have you blabbing about this to everyone , can we ? So I 'm going to smooth over your memory traces , you see ? Now , this device is very , very efficient , but it does melt about half a human brain . Pbbblt ! They 'll never notice in Canada . Well , then ... as I 'm not blowing the place up , that 'll give me time to buy a few souvenirs , or maybe I 'll get a massage . Yes , that 's it , a massage . Ha ! Ha ha ha ! Human brain . Some of us don 't have a human brain . So , you see , I , an alien , saved the earth by being a better human than any human could ever be . Yeah , Dick . We get the irony . It 's really pretty obvious . I just wish that I could tell all the people that I 've saved . Yeah , but you can 't . Oh , I know . Wow ! Mary Albright and another alien . What are the odds of that happening ? Oh , shut up . No , seriously . I mean , the odds of an earth woman having a physical relationship with an extraterrestrial- - well , that 's got to be about a billion to one , but to have it with two ? Wow ! Shut up . You don 't suppose all those other guys she 's been with were aliens ? What other guys ? [ Singing from das rheingold ] Sit down ! Nobody leaves until Wotan has stolen the ring from Alberich !

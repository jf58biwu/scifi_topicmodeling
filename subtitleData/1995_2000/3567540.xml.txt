 [ Young Jarod ] I just wanna know who I am . I can stand anything for that . I 'll never give up , Sydney , ever . It 's been three days , Jarod , with temperature over 100 degrees . You don 't have to go on , Jarod . I can do it . I just wanna know who I am . [ Young Jarod ] I can stand anything for that . - [ Beeping ] - Where did they find this ? Cleanup crew found it in a cabin about 50 miles south of Albuquerque . - [ Sydney ] A gift from Jarod . - Hmm . So , what does it mean ? I 'm not sure what the original intent of the simulation was . I 'll have to run it through the archives . Save your sweat . It 's just another diversion . I beg to differ , Miss Parker . This is very important toJarod . He 's reaching out , taking a leap of faith . [ Jarod Shouting ] All right . Now , remember what you learned in class . - I think I 'm gonna throw up ! - Oh , no , no . You 're gonna be just fine ! - Well , you 're the expert . - Sort of . Sort of ? Exactly how many times have you jumped ? - Counting this ? - Yes ! One . [ Woman Screaming ] [ Man Narrating ] Tough jump ? I may have underestimated my payload . Well , they come in all shapes and sizes . Rub some of this on it . - What is it ? - Horse liniment . They use it on thoroughbreds when they pull a muscle . A few more of them El Paso housewives ... you 'll be drinkin ' the stuff . [ Sighs ] Another satisfied customer . Nice to see that you can carry your weight around here . The instructor job is yours if you still want it . - Great ! It 's a pleasure to be here . - Good . Crockett . Did I get a call from Tasco ? [ Crockett ] Phone hasn 't rung all day . [ Woman ] How 's the old girl holding up ? [ Scoffs ] I was able to patch the leak in the fuel pump ... but she 's definitely on death 's door . Just hold her together for a few more days ... and I 'll have that new plane flown in from Phoenix . Your résumé is very impressive . 82nd Airborne , Army Ranger . Lofty credentials for someone looking to teach the public to tuck and roll . - Why us ? - Well , I 'm on the run from a secret organization . I needed a place to hide out for a while . [ Broots ] We 've been over this simulation a dozen times . I 'm not sure I understand the point . [ Miss Parker ] Sydney didn 't always have method , just madness . It was a psychological study to determine ... if the mind can enable the body to exceed its natural capabilities ... when an emotional stimulus is applied . Like when ... when a car 's on top of a child , and the mother lifts it off with one hand . Exactly . [ Man ] Miss Parker , this birthday gift just arrived . Is today your birthday ? How old are you ? Oh . Young , I 'm sure . Jarod . Know this man ? I 've never seen him before in my life . Interesting . It 's a dead flower , Sydney , not the Shroud ofTurin . [ Jarod ] Excuse me for saying this ... but it doesn 't exactly look like business is booming . We 've had some problems , but they 're all behind us now . Problems ? I lost my partner a couple of months ago . Tom Miles ? I saw the picture of the two of you in the hangar . He , uh , made a jump about 200 miles out into the desert . - Tom was always testing himself . - Testing ? He took one canteen of water , a compass , and a knife , and hiked back in . It was this ... yearly ritual . Uh , something went wrong and ... he died . So all I can do now is make Tom 's dream ... of turning Blue Desert into the best skydiving school in Texas come true . We 're gonna get a new jump plane , redo the hangar . Maybe even build a new indoor training facility . - Hmm . - Tom deserves that . It 's not much to look at , but , uh , the A.C. works . There 's a phone and VCR . And for the most part , it keeps the snakes out . - Well , I 'm sure it will be fine . - [ Horn Honks ] What are you doing way out here in the middle of the day ? Well , I had some business over in Mason County , so ... thought I might see if you wanted to get some lunch . Meat loaf 's on special at the diner . Unless I 'm interrupting something . Oh , Jarod Cochran , this is , uh , Sheriff Dwight Kunkle . - Sheriff . - Mr. Cochran . Jarod here is our latest addition to thejump school . Huh . Where you from ? Oh , here and there . Whichever way the wind blows . How about that lunch ? - Well , I was just gonna show Jarod ... - Oh , no , no . You two go ahead . I 'll be just fine . Nice to meet you , Sheriff . Cochran . [ Starts Engine ] [ Man ] You 're late . I 've been waiting for you . - Excuse me ? - I was told a traveler would come seeking truth . - Told by whom ? - The sky fathers . What you would call a gut feeling . They said you would need a guide . I don 't understand . See what I mean ? How 'd he do that ? [ Miss Parker ] Well ? [ Broots ] I ran his picture through the system . If he 's any kind of Centre contractor ... then he 's either been deleted ... or he 's out of our clearance level . Nobody 's out of my clearance level . - What about this ? - Torture . - Torture ? - Jarod 's playing games . - Why ? - Because he wants to give me an aneurysm . I don 't know why . It 's ... just what he does . What about the picture ? I blew it up three ways from Sunday . See , let me show you . All I got is a street sign . Black Ridge Lane . I don 't know if that helps with anything . Maybe the location . Maybe you 're right . Maybe he just wants to torture you . - Broots . - What ? - Zoom in on that . - What ? [ Miss Parker ] The reflection on the windshield . [ Keyboarding ] [ Miss Parker ] Again . Again . - One more time , sharper . - [ Computer Beeping ] [ Miss Parker ] Maine . I 'll be damned ! [ Vehicle Approaching ] Let me get that . - [ Breathing Heavily ] - Are you okay ? - I just lost my grip . - Why don 't you come sit down ? I 'm a little dizzy . Uh , can I get you something ? A glass of water or something ? No , I just need to catch my breath . - Can I ask you something ? - Sure . - Who are you ? - [ Chuckles ] My name is Jarod . Angela . I , uh , need to put these things in the shed . No , no . Let me get that . - Are you learning to jump ? - Uh , no . Actually , I just started working here . - You 're the new instructor . - You sound disappointed . I just didn 't expect Carol to hire someone so soon after ... - What ? - Baby 's kicking . - He must not like the heat . - It 's a boy ? His father must be very proud . His father 's dead . The first rule of skydiving is to respect your equipment . Because without it , you die . Do you understand ? [ All ] Hai . Now , the key to a safe jump is to open your chute at the right altitude . And we do that by pulling the silver handle . We do not pull the orange handle . You ready to give it a try ? All right . We 're over the target , and we jump . [ Jarod ] The ground is rushing towards us . You are ready to open your chute . - You pull the silver handle . ! - [ Grunts ] [ Engine Winds Down ] I guess it lost somethin in the translation . [ Grunting ] [ Sydney ] Benjamin Thomas Miller . Single . Runs the local bed-and-breakfast . I 'm looking for dirt , Sydney . There isn 't any . I don 't think he 's even had a parking ticket . - [ Sydney ] Not him . - Well , then why would Jarod lead us here ? He didn 't . The little red notebook was the Miss Parker Edition . Meaning ? He wanted you here , alone . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] What ? [ Jarod ] Let 's see . It 's 12 : 00 noon , where you are . I recommend the Monte Cristo . You can 't beat a sandwich with syrup . It is a little bit fattening . What the hey . You could stand to put on a few pounds . How would you know ? Oh , you never know who might be peeking over your transom . Uh , uh , uh . Setting back the bathroom scale three pounds , that 's cheating . - What do you want , Jarod ? - Same thing you do . Answers . By now , I would imagine that you are staking out the Green Ridge Diner ... where Ben Miller is finishing up his usual lunch . [ Jarod ] Diet cola , B.L. T. , no mayo . I am impressed with your eye for detail . I can see I 'm going to have to secure my cell phone number . Mmm . Those Centre operators , they will transfer you anywhere with the right clearance code . You should look into that . Yeah , I would . Except I 'm too busy chasing ghosts . - Well , Ben Miller , he 's more of a skeleton . - [ Miss Parker ] Skeleton ? Check your closet lately ? Get out . - Excuse me ? - Get out . Try the Monte Cristo . I hear it 's excellent . - Ready ? - Hai . ! - Sayonara . - [ Yelling ] - Ready ? - Hai . ! - Sayonara . ! - [ Yells ] Hey . What 's this for ? For lunatics . [ Wind Blowing ] [ Jarod Laughing ] This was awesome . You know , this thing would work really well in the snow . [ Clears Throat ] Yeah . Carol Bates says you used to be a skydiver . Well , I made a jump or two . - You miss it ? - It ? The adrenaline rush . Pushing the envelope and living to tell about it . Well , sometimes that envelope 's a little thinner than it looks . You talking about Tom Miles ? I took him up that day . You know , the sad part is , that was gonna be his last jump . Isn 't it a little difficult to run a jump school if you don 't jump ? Hey . This school has just barely eked by for years . Tom didn 't care about any of that . He was just a plain old simple guy . All he really cared about was his wife and that baby comin ' . [ Sighs ] He loved this place . He just wanted to have a chance to share it with his son ... before somebody come along and spoiled it . Expect he pushed that envelope one too many times . From what I understand , Tom was a survival expert . He successfully made that jump and trek into the desert a dozen times before he died . Just ' cause you can do something , doesn 't mean you should . But , hey , it 's the desert . Strange things can happen out there . [ Man ] So many lies , so little time . You need some soda . - Who are you ? - Two Feathers , son of War Eagle . Ever heard of me ? No . That 's ' cause everybody calls me Ernie . I 'm guessing it 's a peach . - [ Ernie ] How . - [ Jarod Exhales ] What is it you want ? - I told you I was sent to be your guide . - Yes . The sky fathers who speak to you from your gut . Bingo . - Where are you guiding me to ? - The truth . I know it 's overwhelming , but I 'm an Indian , so what do you want from me ? Meet me tonight . - We can talk later . - Wait . - How will I find you ? - Follow the path of the iron horse . - The what ? - The train tracks . Didn 't you ever see a John Wayne movie ? And bring some of that leftover meat loaf with you . - What meat loaf ? - [ Wind Blows ] [ Lamp Shatters ] [ Exhales ] - Huh . - [ Knocking On Door ] [ Jarod ] I don 't know who you think you 're dealing with ... but I 'm getting pretty tired of your magic tr ... I have to admit . I 've had warmer welcomes . Did you see an old man ? Huh . Never mind . I , um , wanted to apologize for the way I acted yesterday . - Oh , it 's okay . - No , you 're new here . There 's no way you could 've known . And ... I 'd like to make it up to you . - How about a home-cooked dinner tonight ? - That would be wonderful . Great . Hope you like meat loaf . [ Door Creaking ] Be right with you . Now , what can I do for ... I was hoping you 'd come . What are you talking about ? You look just like her . Like who ? Your mother . Thank you . I 'm sure this won 't take long . Sheriff , I was wondering if I might have a minute . Mr. Cochran , I 'm due in Dallas in about three hours . Maybe some other time . Oh , okay . I just wanted to ask you a question about Tom Miles . - But we 'll do it another time . - What about Tom ? Well , I understand that you found his body . - That 's right . - Must have been a pretty gruesome sight . Body out there in the desert for , what , three days ? - Four . - Four , ugh . See , what I don 't understand is ... why would a survival expert like Tom Miles allow himself to die of dehydration ? What are you so interested in a dead man for ? Well , I met his widow . Seemed like a very nice lady . Never mind . Have a very nice day . Oh , Sheriff , one other quick question . Was there an autopsy done on the body ? Of course . Just because we live in the backwaters doesn 't mean we 're backwoods . Thank you very much . [ Woman ] She ate the whole meat loaf ? Well , then it is no wonder she can 't find panty hose ... to fit those thick thighs of hers then , huh ? - [ Door Opens ] - Yeah . [ Chuckles ] Oh . I 'll call you later . - [ Jarod ] Afternoon . - Afternoon . Buddy Slocum Jr . I represent the southwest regional office of the Internal Revenue Service . I.R.S. ? I need to have a word with a Sheriff Dwight Knuckle . Kunkle . The sheriff 's name is Kunkle . Sheriff Knuck ... Kunkle is in Dallas for the afternoon . Well , that could pose a dilemma . Buddy . Maybe I can help you . Yes . As a matter of fact , maybe you can . Do you have some information on a Mr. Thomas Miles ? Well , he 's dead . Not as far as the I.R.S. is concerned . Well , thanks again , ma 'am . [ Angela ] Tom was gonna finish the baby 's room when he got back . He must have been very excited about becoming a father . [ Angela ] It was his whole world . Before Tom went off on the last jump ... he told me how important it was for him to be a good father ... to teach our son about life . He used to say that life was meant to be lived ... and death wasn 't something to be afraid of . Is that why he made those jumps into the desert ? Carol 's right . It 's important that his son know who his father was . - The things he cared about . - Carol said that . She said that if the school closed , then Tom 's death would be meaningless . - Thank God for Tom 's insurance money . - What do you mean ? We 're gonna use it to rebuild the jump school . Hasn 't been easy for her . [ Jarod ] Because of the business ? Because of the history between them . - The history ? - Carol and Tom were together long before we met . They grew apart , fell out . He used to say she was unhappy , but he never spoke bad about her . I think it 's nice that she wants to keep his dream alive . [ Beeping ] - Just tell me you 've given up . - [ Young Jarod ] No . Admit it to yourself and I 'll make this stop ! Not for me . [ Young Jarod ] I 'll never give up . [ Echoing ] Never give up . Mr. Two Feathers ? Uh , Mr. Two Feathers ? Ernie ? Oh ! [ Gasps ] Would you please stop doing that ? I see you remembered . Thank you . Your meat loaf . You left your hat . Thank you . Sit down . Is this where you live ? You expected a teepee ? It 's 43 feet of good living , satellite TV . I even get dirty movies . - Compliments of Uncle Sam . - Uncle who ? There was a question about a certain piece of tribal land and who owned it . - And this was your settlement ? - I would 've settled for a new hat . White people . I don 't know how we lost the country . You told me before that you were going to guide me to the truth . Oh , that . My family 's lived under this sky for over seven generations . I 've seen many things in the desert . Things ? I found the body of the man who walks on clouds . I thought Sheriff Kunkle found Tom Miles 's body . It wouldn 't be smart for an Indian to ride into town ... with a white war hero strapped across the grille of his motor home . Why would a survival expert like Tom Miles die of dehydration ... when all those yucca plants were around him ? When I saw his face , I knew what happened . According to the police report ... the wounds on his face were inflicted by an animal . It was no animal . It was his madness . I 've seen it only one time before in my life ... during the vision quest . Vision quest ? Ayoung man of age drinks from the root of the belladonna plant ... in the hopes of going to the world beyond . If the mixture is wrong , he could lose himself , go mad . Belladonna . Who else knows about this plant ? Anyone who 's lived their life in the desert would know . I see your gut talks to you too . Hmm . This is pretty good . Jarod worked the place about a month . He was quite the fix-it man . - He 's a genius . - I don 't know about that . But he could fix a tractor , talk your ear off . That fella was always askin ' questions . I didn 't come here to talk aboutJarod . Well , that 's funny . All he wanted to talk about was you . - Me ? - He said you two had grown up together . Seemed disappointed when I didn 't know much . Guess your mother never told you about this place . No . She didn 't . She came here exactly this time every year . She loved the spring . She said she liked what it did to the world . Aunt Dorothy . Excuse me ? She used to tell me she was visiting her sister . Ah . I 'm sure she had her reasons . When your mother didn 't show up , I got worried . I never knew exactly how ... I was pretty young . But I do remember that her death was , uh , sudden . Is there anything of hers ... It would mean a lot to me if I could see where she stayed . [ Crockett ] Look here , Carol , it 's just not workin 'out . ! I have to move on . - Once we get the new plane from Phoenix , we 're fine . - You know I can 't go back there ! [ Rifling Papers ] [ Woman ] Tasco Sport Adventure . [ Jarod ] I 'm trying to put together a vacation . You come highly recommended . Yes , sir . At Tasco Sport Adventure , you get the vacation of a lifetime . Bungee jumping and then golf ... helicopter snow skiing in the Andes , or shark hunting off the Barrier Reef . Actually , I had skydiving in mind . You 're in luck ! In two months , we 're opening a skydiving school near El Paso . [ Jarod ] Well , that sounds interesting . Very interesting . - Uh , I 'll let you know . - Thanks for calling . [ Tools Clanking ] - [ Wrench Racheting ] - Ow ! - [ Slams Tools Down ] - Piece of crap ! - Oh , come on , Crockett . - God ! Oh ... - [ Inhales , Coughs ] - Plane only has to last a few more days . - You scared me there , bub . - Why ? Because you thought I was Carol ? She scares you , doesn 't she , Crockett ? Or should I say Angus ? Angus Marin ? Who are you ? Somebody who found out you 're a wanted man ... and is going to use it to their advantage . - Just like Carol did . - You sound like you have been drinking that horse liniment . I know Carol 's using Angela to get to Tom Miles 's insurance money . So she can refurbish this jump school ... and increase the price that Tasco Adventures is willing to pay for it . I also know you are getting 25 % of whatever Carol 's stake is in the sale . What I don 't know is why . Is it because you know she killed Tom Miles ? Or because you helped her ? This was her room . [ Ben ] I haven 't touched anything since she left . - [ Soft Chuckle ] - What ? Looking at you standing there , I thought for a minute I saw Catherine again . You call if you need anything . See , Tom and Carol come out here as young lovers , bought this place together . Only it was 60-40 , Tom 's favor . After they broke up , he met Angela , and got married . He was here for life , and Carol knew it . She wanted to sell , but he could never get the cash together . By that time , the place had gotten so run down till ... 40 % of nothing 's still nothin ' . And that 's when the people from Tasco came around . Wavin ' long green . But Tom didn 't want the place destroyed . So , when Carol couldn 't get her money and get out , shejust shut down . Then what happened ? She came out to the hangar the morning of the jump , switched Tom 's canteen . I didn 't think anything about it at the time . It didn 't mean anything then . But later on , after he died , I got to thinkin ' about it . When I asked her ... She threatened to turn you in to the police . She offered me a percentage ... just to help her get the place turned around for the sale to Tasco . We looked at each other andjust knew . Willing to hate each other long enough to get our payoffs and get on with our lives . Well , unfortunately for Tom Miles , he won 't be able to get on with his . [ Wrench Clinking ] [ Southern Accent ] Yes . I 'd like to order a slab of beef ribs . Well , that 's fantastic . But I 'd like them raw . Yes , raw . So , let 's get this straight . If I arrive in Phoenix first , I get the plane ? Well , I 'll get there first . - Have you seen Crockett ? - No . Is there something wrong ? I just got a call from Phoenix . There 's another party interested in the plane . They 're gonna make a deal with the first one who shows up ! Oh . Well , shouldn 't be more than a six or seven-hour drive . I don 't have six or seven hours . Well , I could fly you . - You 're a pilot ? - Mm-hmm . - How long till we can take off ? - Twenty minutes . - [ Ben ] How ' bout some coffee ? - [ Miss Parker ] Thank you . - How 'd you sleep ? - Well . Better than that , actually . This place tends to do that to people . Sure you don 't want to take some of her things with ya ? No . I have everything I need . Besides , this is where she belongs . You were in love with her , weren 't you ? Your mother was a very special woman . There was a part ofher I knew better than anyone . But there was a part of her she kept hidden . - Separate . - Did she ever talk about him ? No . She left it all behind when she came here . But ... she always missed her little girl . I 'll get you some breakfast . Thank you . - Why are we heading north ? - Weather radar . There 's a storm front moving in from the southwest ... so I figured it would be safer if we flew around it . How long to Phoenix ? - About an hour , hour and a half . - [ Engine Sputters ] What 's wrong ? We 're losing pressure . I think it 's the fuel pump . This terrain is much too dangerous to land . If the overflow of fuel should reach the engine , the whole plane could explode . We 're going to have to jump . - Jump ? - Jump . Relax . We 're skydiving instructors , remember ? What the hell do you mean he was polite ? You just give out confidential crime scene files ... to anybody who walks in here with a smile on their face ? He said he was with the I.R.S. Damn it , Aida . I 've told you a million times . - Police business is ... - [ Jarod On Radio ] Alpha-Tango-997 . This is a Mayday . I repeat , this is a Mayday . Our aircraft is on fire . We 're going to parachute approximately 37 miles due north of Fort Hancock . Mayday . Mayday . [ Transmission Turns Off ] 997 ... that 's Carol 's plane . You call the civil air patrol . Dispatch Search and Rescue right now . Going my way , Sheriff ? [ Grunting ] - Are you okay ? - [ Grunting ] Ah , I think I broke my leg . Hey . [ Grunting ] - Don 't worry . Somebody 'll find us . - [ Grunts ] I 'm not so sure . What are you saying ? There 's a chance that nobody knows we 're out here ? I don 't know . I don 't know if the Mayday transmission made it out . [ Sighs ] Well , what the hell do you suggest we do ? [ Jarod ] There 's about six or seven hours left of sunlight . If you travel lightly , you can make it to Fort Hancock by dark . - Me ? What if I don 't make it ? - You 'll make it . - [ Sighs ] - Head due south . And here 's a full canteen of water . Make sure you drink plenty of it . You wouldn 't want to end up like Tom . I 'll see you soon . Count on it . [ Voice Whispering ] Carol . [ Chanting ] - [ Voice Whispering ] Carol . - [ Echoing ] Who 's there ? [ Gasps ] [ Voice Whispering ] Carol . What 's happening to me ? [ Jarod ] Same thing that happened to Tom Miles . - Tom ? - Now , maybe you can imagine how Tom felt those last moments . Dying out here , all alone . Tom . Tom , I 'm sorry . You took his canteen , and you poisoned it with belladonna . The harder the sun bore down , the more delirious he became with every tainted drink . And every minute that passed was just another agonizing moment ... when he realized he would never see his baby that he wanted so much . It got so bad that he wandered in circles . He clawed at his own body to fight off the madness that you created for him . [ Echoing ] The madness that you created for him . [ Breathing Heavily ] No . It was a school and a family . You took that away . ! You just gave it to her . ! [ Crying ] Till there was nothing left for me . So you left a widow behind and a baby to be born fatherless . Tom , I just wanted what I deserved . Something tells me you 're going to get just that . [ Cell Phone Rings ] Hello , Jarod . With instincts like that , you 'll catch me yet . Not if you keep throwing me off the trail . Oh , I didn 't throw you off . I just put you on a different one . Is that all you do , Jarod ? Dig up the past ? That 's easy for you to say . You have one . Although , it 's not quite what you thought it was , is it ? Happy birthday . [ Angela ] Okay , sweetie . Let 's go night-night . [ Fussing ] Ho , white man . Came by to say good-bye , thank you . Well , so long , and you 're welcome . When we first met , you told me you were gonna help me discover the truth . I was kind of hoping it would have been about myself . About who I am . We each take a journey we 're meant to take . For some , it 's clear . For others , not so clear . Am I going the right way ? Just keep listening to your gut . [ Wind Blows ] [ Mews ]

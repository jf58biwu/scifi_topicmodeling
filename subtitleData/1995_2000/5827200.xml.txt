 Okay . Is Gary 's mystery date going to be a dream or a dud ? Oh , wow . A dork with a bow tie . A dud ! You know , it feels like I 'm the only one trying here . That 's because guys don 't do slumber parties . - Let 's do something else . - We could talk about guys ' butts . Next . We could watch Little Women . - Rumble in the Bronx . - Boys on the Side . Delta Force Four . Where he cuts the guy 's head off ? - That 's the best part ! - No . Tonight we do what I want to do . I want to watch a movie that makes me cry . You didn 't cry when he ate that grenade to save his buddies ? No blood . I want to see a chick flick . Chick flick , slumber parties , mystery date . Are you going girlie on us , Lis ? - I am a girl . - Maybe you should find some girlfriends . But I don 't have any friends except you guys . Oh ! Lisa , you wound me . I thought I was your friend . Your belle . Your bosom buddy . Yeah , right . I can 't be in the same room with you without going for my pepper spray . What ? ! I can 't control my sex drive ? Don 't flatter yourself . My libido doesn 't jump until I say " frog . " Let 's test that , shall we ? Hey ... - what the hell is this ? - A friendship reinforcement unit . Anytime Chett gets an impure thought about me he gets a friendly electrical reminder . Mm ... I ... I 'm a little confused here . Y ... You mean , if Chett were to think of you in , say , a ... thong bikini ... with sweat ... Glistening off your perfect skin ... - [ electrical buzzing ] - [ screaming ] He 'd get shocked ? Gosh , that is mean . Oh , uh , Lis ? I can almost see your bra strap . - [ screaming ] - [ electrical buzzing ] You think you 're pretty smart , huh ? [ screaming ] She might make a good girlfriend . Mm ... nah . She doesn 't look like she 'd be any fun at a sleepover . Whoo ! She does . Thanks for your help , Sir Lecherlot . Here we go . The usual . Thanks , Tisch . You 're the best . Thanks for the ego feed . I just wish you guys would go for the gusto and order something different . For once . LISA : Who am I kidding ? I 'll never find a girlfriend . Don 't worry , Lis . I just thought of a place where there are lots of women . WOMEN : Don 't ride too high . Gary , what were you thinking ? Lisa won 't fit in with them . - Why not ? - They all have babies . When in Rome ... Hey , there , little rubber head . Coodgy-woodgy-woo . Oh , so cute . And on Tuesdays we have Mommy and me lunch at Fuddruckers . And on Fridays we all have swim time at my house . Sounds like fun . [ dog snarling ] The dingo ate your baby ! It 's okay . I can always make more . - Ugh ! - Ugh ! What ? Here we go ! Ice cream . - I didn 't order this . - I ordered it . You looked depressed and ice cream cheers me up . Ooh . Chunky Monkey . How did you know this was my favorite ? I 'm a good guesser . I 'm kind of psychic that way . Me too . Kind of . Oh , yeah ? What 's my favorite tree ? The Lodgepole Pine . Ooh ... you 're good ! May I join you ? I knew you were going to say that . So , that accounts for my interest in stars . I can 't believe your dad was an astronaut . - That 's pretty cool . - What about your dad ? My dad ? Well ... he was never really around . Oh ... I 'm sorry . Oh , it 's okay . My mother took care of us . We had this rock band . We toured around on this multi-colored bus and had lots of adventures . We had to watch out for my brother , Danny . - What a schemer . - So , when did you settle in California ? We , uh , moved here to be with my Uncle Steve after the accident . - The accident . - He was a test pilot . It turned out okay . They made him better , stronger ... - Faster ? ! - They had the technology . I 've been lying my butt off . Every time I open my mouth , I dig myself in deeper . - I 've got to start telling the truth . - The truth . You know ... [ whispering ] : That I 'm a magic genie . No , no . Bad idea . Lies- - go with the lies . I 'm tired of a friendship based on deceit . Tisch doesn 't like me . She likes the Thursday Nick at Night Lineup . Hello , ladies . Say , Lisa , how about dinner ? You and me . I 'll get sitter for the kids . Oh , really ? You won 't mind if I wear my backless , versace mini ? [ snickering ] As a matter of fact , I insist . And you won 't mind at all if I order lobster and suck the butter off my fingers one at a time ... - real slow ? - [ snickering ] Better wear a bib . Chett ... what 's in your pants ? Ice . Four bags . I 'm in such excruciating agony right now that I couldn 't think a sexy thought if you stripped naked and made me lick baby oil from your novel . Uh-oh . [ screams ] [ door creaking ] [ crashing ] Ow ... ow . [ phone ringing ] [ Chett groans ] Oh , that 's bad . [ phone ringing ] [ chuckling ] [ Chett yelling ] How you doing , Mr. Pattison ? So , you and the other angels never actually saw Charlie ? You just sort of heard him over the speaker phone ? Uh , let 's not talk about me . Tell me more about your life . You already know all about my life . Come on , there must be something you haven 't told me . You haven 't told me . You know , don 't you ? See , that 's what I get for lying . You see right through me . - Huh ? - I have a confession to make . My father isn 't actually an astronaut . His job is to test the suits for leaks . - You mad ? - Of course not . Ooh , what a relief ! You don 't know what it 's like to carry around a secret that big . I mean , the guilt is unbearable . I know exactly what you mean . Lies ... it 's all lies ! I 'm nothing but a big , fat fibber . I made it all up to avoid telling the truth about myself but no more . Tisch ... I 'm really a magic genie . There , I said it . You mean like in that old show with Barbara Eden ? Yes . - What ? - I can 't believe it . We spend three years keeping you under wraps and now you go around blabbing about yourself ? Will you calm down ? We told Chett , and nothing bad happened . That 's because he wants to have sex with you . That 's what kept my mouth shut at first . I was tired of lying to my friend . Okay . Okay , damage control . What exactly did Tisch say when you told her ? She was really cool about it . She just kinf of nodded her head over and over and said , " That 's nice . " - And then she went to feed the ducks . - Whew . Man , oh , man , that was a close one . - What ? - Lis , she was patronizing you . Like , when I ask a girl out the polite ones always nod their heads and say , " That 's nice " and then make a quick escape . The ducks were a nice touch , actually . [ gate opening ] Uh-oh . Trouble . You guys just can 't handle the fact that I have a girlfriend . [ sizzling and gasping ] Brain ... burning ... up ! [ grunts ] I don 't want to seem selfish but I 'm glad she didn 't believe you . Yeah . Because if she did it wouldn 't be just - the three of us anymore . - You guys are right . So , I 'm just going to have to go prove I 'm a genie . [ groaning ] And then maybe Tisch and I will take a bubble bath together . [ spasmodic gasping ] Man , I got to get rid of these things before they kill me . [ sighs ] Hey , Tisch . - Oh , I 'm sorry . - How 'd you do that ? - I told you- - I 'm a genie . - Right . Genie . Tisch , what 's wrong ? I told you about my aura paintings and my astro-colonics and the time I was almost abducted by aliens because it was important to me and then you go and make fun of my beliefs by saying that you 're genie . I thought we were friends . You thought I was making fun of you ? Well , weren 't you ? You be the judge . Go ahead , make a wish . - Lisa , this is crazy . - Anything you want . - Name it . - Okay , I wish ... I wish it was raining men . Now there 's one I can get into . [ thunder booms ] [ men yelling ] I don 't even want to know . I can 't feel my legs . Now do you believe me ? Oh , my gosh ! You really are a genie . Do you have green blood ? Do you have any blood ? - Where are you from ? - Tisch , chill . We 're still the same friends we were only now I can be honest with you . This is so freaky ! You and , and ... You have metal skin or anything ? No tickling . - Oh , when people find out about you ... - Uh-uh-uh . You can 't tell anybody . Oh ... right . Not a word . Except , can I tell my sister ? She just loves this kind of thing . - It 's really important . - Okay . Okay . I won 't tell her . Although , she would be surprised but , no . No , I won 't say anything to anyone . You can 't tell anyone . - Got it ? - This is so wild . - [ electrical zap ] - [ gasps ] That 's her . Stay frosty . All right ? - Hey , Lis ! - Ready to go antiquing ? There 's some great stuff in 18th century England I 've got my eye on . And there 's also this little store downtown that 's got some ... Lisa , this is my sister , Carmen . Nice to meet you , Carmen . So , you live around here ? You told her ! - Do you have green blood ? - Don 't be stupid . - How could you do this ? ! - I 'm sorry . I 'm just really bad at secrets . But this could be a good thing . See , now you have two friends that you can share with . - And I won 't tell a soul . - Well , I suppose maybe it 's okay as long as it stays amongst the three of us . As long as it stays amongst the five of us . As long as it stays amongst the 11 of us . As long as it stays amongst the 30 of us . - 31 ! - Sorry , Scooter . - Missed you back there . - Do another trick , Lisa . - [ clamoring ] - All right . All right . - What do you want to see ? - Show us a real alien . ALL : Yeah ! Yeah ! [ all gasping ] [ speak native tongue ] MAN : Wow ! He was so cute . What did he say ? Howdy . - Bring Elvis back to life . - Dud , he isn 't dead . CROWD : Ooh ! Lisa . If my taxable income is up five percent should I ... schedule " C " for non-taxable deductions or just call it a business loss ? [ crowd grumbles ] Oh . Sorry . - Change me into an otter . - [ crowd cheering ] - No . No more otters . - [ crowd chattering ] : Otter ! Otter ! - WOMAN : Is Nicorette good for you ? - CROWD : Otter ! Otter ! Give me godlike powers over life and death . Hey , you guys ... you guysare upsetting Lisa . Leave her alone ! What 's come over you guys ? - Hey ! - Give me lots of money ! Stop ! Leave her alone . - Ow ! - MAN : Hey , I got her magic hair ! - Otter ! Otter ! Otter ! - That 's it ! - Enough ! - [ thunder crashing ] [ screaming ] [ crowd whimpers ] Lisa ... ? You mad ? [ altered voice ] : You have triled with powers beyond your puny comprehension . - You have angered the genie ! - Hear that ? You have angered the genie . - I just asked her to do another trick . - He pulled her hair ! - I did not . - Shut up ! [ screaming ] [ altered voice ] : Never again will you so rudely inconvenience the magic genie . Prepare to suffer the consequences . Oh , Lord , we 're going to die . - Whew ! - Whew ! Glad we took care of that . You want some help cleaning up ? You killed them . Don 't be a goose . I sent them home . - They were bugging me . - Oh ! Oh , I 'm sorry , Lisa . Oh , this whole thing got weird . I mean , I thought those guys could handle it . Now you know why I don 't tell anybody . Oh , no . I just realized . By tomorrow the whole world will know about you . You won 't get a moment 's peace , and it 's all my fault . Don 't worry , I wiped their memories when I sent them away . They won 't remember a thing about me . - You can do that ? - It 's how I 've kept my secret for so long . Oh . Well , that takes care of them . - What about me ? - What do you mean ? Well , they never would have found out if I hadn 't opened my big mouth . I mean , I can 't keep a secret . Watch . My best friend 's a genie . See ? - Did you say " best friend " ? - Yeah . You want to know something ? You 're my best friend too . - You 're going to make cry . - I 'm sorry . - I didn 't mean to make you cry . - Oh , no . - I love crying . - Me too . You 're going to have to wipe my memory too , you know ? - I 'll never forget you . - I 'll never forget you . Oh , wait . Thanks for everything , Tisch . Good-bye , Lisa . Uh , " say , Lis , I hear there 's a big sale at bloomies . - Let us shop until we drop . " - " Great idea , Gary . " I sure could use some ... moisturizer and we could split a salad at the food court . " Uh , " Just keep me away from those shoe stores . I go pump crazy . " Look , guys , I appreciate your effort but it 's just not the same as having a real girlfriend . So , if you don 't mind I 'd just like to spend some time by myself . " We 're staying . This is when you need your sisters the most . " - I didn 't order this . - I ordered it . You look kind of depressed sitting here , and ice cream always cheers me up . My name 's Tisch . Lisa . Nice to meet you . - Is this Chunky Monkey ? - Mm-hmm . How did you know this was my favorite ? Oh , I 'm a good guesser . I 'm kind of psychic that way . Me too . Kind of . All right , what 's my favorite tree ? - The Lodgepole Pine . - Ooh , you 're good . [ Chett moaning ] Wakey time , Chett . You want to watch us do our aerobics ?

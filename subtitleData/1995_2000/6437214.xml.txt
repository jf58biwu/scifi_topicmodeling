 You make man ? No . Woman . FRANKENSTEIN 'S MONSTER ( ON TELEVISION ) : Woman ? THEME SONG : Weird science , Ooh ! Pictures from a magazine , diagrams and charts , mending broken hearts and making weird science . Something like a recipe , bits and pieces- - bits and pieces- - pieces- - pieces- - My creation . Is it real ? It 's my creation . Ooh ! My creation . It 's my creation . No heart of gold , just flesh and blood . I do not know . It 's my creation . Ooh ! My creation . It 's my creation . From my heart and from my hand , why don 't people understand ? It 's alive . Alive ! [ MUSIC PLAYING ] [ LAUGHTER ] MRS. WALLACE : Blow out your candles ! All right . Thanks Mr. and Mrs. Wallace . I was going to put a candle on for every SAT point that you scored but they wouldn 't all fit . Well , you could always do that with Gary 's cake . GARY WALLACE : Dad . I told you . A computer glitch screwed up my test . Uh huh . You know , I never took the SATs myself . Mom sure wanted me to , though . So you 'd be the first one in your family to go to college ? No , to avoid the draft . But I tell you , I 'd rather take a bullet from a Commie than take a three hour test . [ CAR HORN ] Hey , Wyatt . Isn 't that your parents ' car ? WYATT DONNELLY : Oh , yeah . It is . They must have found out you were having a party for me . Hi , honey . I can 't believe you guys are here . Neither can we . Now , we 're here on the authority of the homeowner 's association . Your Christmas decorations have got to come down . AL WALLACE : My award winning Winter Wallace Land ? Why ? Because it 's May for one thing . The elves are peeling and Blitzen 's got a family of chipmunks living in his skull . WAYNE DONNELLY : There have been complaints . It 's an eyesore . What eyesore ? I specifically designed it to blend in with its surroundings . Wait here . I want to show you something . Wyatt . They 've got a cake for you . Did we forget his birthday again ? WAYNE DONNELLY : If we did , my secretary will be looking for a new job . Wyatt got the highest SAT scores in school . We 're having a little celebration . MARCIA DONNELLY : The highest . Well , that 's wonderful . Well , I think that calls for something special . We 're very proud of you , sweetie . Man . Your parents love you so much . Well . See that ? First place . Nobody complained about my decorations the day they gave this bad boy out . Well , they are now . It 's my house . Why can 't I do what I want ? Because it 's everyone 's neighborhood . And because we 're trying to keep certain standards- - My property values are plummeting , Al- - WYATT DONNELLY : I can 't believe they 'd embarrass me like that . It 's like they couldn 't care less about my SAT scores or me . I know a certain genie that might be able to help . You know , if you ask her nice . I wish that my family was closer . The most tight-knit caring household in the neighborhood . The kind that puts family above everything else . Oh . Family as dysfunction as yours ? Going to take one hell of a zap . May even have to tap into the sun . Ha ha . He thinks I 'm kidding . [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ] [ ZAP ] Oh ! [ CRASH ] [ OPERA MUSIC PLAYING ] Lisa ? Gary . My mom . She 's in the kitchen . Cooking . [ HUMMING ] Oh , there 's my baby boy . Come here ! When did you learn how to cook ? Back in the old country . If a young girl didn 't learn how to cook , she didn 't get a husband . I see . Mama . I love this guy . Yeah . Love . Love . Hey , here . $ 50 . Go get an education , huh , you crazy kid . I love this guy . Taste . Taste . Bang ! [ OLD ITALIAN MUSIC PLAYING ] Hey . I found Lisa . The Donnelli family grants your request . But someday- - and that day may never come- - I shall call upon you to do a service for me . Oh . Must be French . I am in your debt , godfather . Godfather ? So you will deliver this message to the Pattersons . Make them an offer they cannot refuse . It will be done , godfather . I wish for a close family . I get the mafia . What are you worried about ? Lisa will take care of us . Lisa doesn 't know who she is anymore . She got zapped by her own spell . Now she 's Dad 's consigliere . Kinky . No . No , it means she 's my dad 's most trusted adviser . She 'll do whatever he says . Kinky . Shut up . And So the guy behind the meat counter is giving me attitude . Till his buddies clue him in to who I am . Then what happened ? Next thing you know , boom , boom , boom . I 'm walking out of there with an armful of complementary skirt steaks . [ LAUGHTER ] Wyatt , one day you will succeed me as head of the family . In preparation for that day , you must learn the family business . What exactly is the family business ? Ah , this and that . Imports , exports . But the heart of the Donnelli empire is the homeowner 's association . Without it , our family is nothing . But you will see this for yourself . Tomorrow , you will accompany your brother on his neighborhood rounds . You will learn the family ways firsthand . There . The Donnelli family keeps the neighborhood safe , especially the little ones . Helping children , I like that . Hey . Watch this . Children love it . [ GIGGLING ] Funny monkey . [ CHOKING ] Crap . [ CHOKING ] [ SPIT ] Ew , icky monkey . We 've got a lot of money riding on this game . So in the fourth inning , I 'm going to want you to get a little case of the butterfingers , capisce ? Oops ! I dropped the ball . I don 't want to hear about any slow week , Susie . You pay on time or accidents start happening . Somebody could come along and badabing . You got pink lemonade all over your nice white dress . What a day . The Donnelli brothers , taking care of business together . Come here . Well , I enjoyed it , too . I just wish business didn 't involve intimidation , bribery , and manly man kisses . Mr. Donnelli . I have not forgotten your kindness . Please accept these suede jackets made by my own hands as a token of respect for the Donnelli family . Tessio , Tessio . You embarrass me with your generosity . Wyatt , show the man your gratitude . No . Kiss the man . Kiss him . Kiss him . Here you go . Suit yourself , bro . But if you ask me , spit 's cheaper . Grazie . It will be Donnellis in my prayers tonight . You see ? We freaking beloved . I defy you to find someone who doesn 't love the Donnelli family . I hate the Donnelli family . They hide behind that homeowners association , but they 're really just a bunch of crooks . The Don 's request remains firm . Your decorations will be removed . My award winning Winter Wallace Land is never coming down . I don 't care what Donnelli wants . Don Donnelli . Donnelli is the last name . Don Donnelli . I thought his first name was Wayne . It is . Don is merely a term of respect . Well , I don 't see anyone kissing Don Ho 's ass . I 'm not giving in . If that 's your final word , then I must leave . The Don is a man who likes to hear bad news right away . Oh , hold on . I don 't want any trouble . In fact , bring the Don by in a few hours and I 'll show him my respect . [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ] How does this grab you , Donnelli ? And the only thing I 'm taking down is this . Chett . You will handle this . [ LAUGHTER ] [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ] [ SCREAM ] And so young Alex here was thrilled to be in his school 's chemistry cavalcade , but brokenhearted to be cast as sulfur , the stinkiest element on the periodic chart . Ah , bambino . [ BANG ] You pushed too far , Donnelli . Now I 'm pushing back . Show our guests into the kitchen for cannoli . You have my attention , Al Wallace . I got half the neighborhood on my side . We want you to release your grip on the homeowners association . This , I cannot do . Then as of this moment , we are officially at war . CROWD : Yeah ! Man , what a jerk . Tell me about it . Why won 't he take down his stupid Christmas lights ? I was talking about your dad , Mr. Bad Fella . Oh , sure . For the first time in my life , I 've got a close knit loving family and your dad wants to ruin it . My dad ? Your dad 's the one bossing everybody around ? Well , he wouldn 't have to if your dad would just play ball . Oh . You want a war , buddy of mine ? You got one . [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ] WAYNE DONNELLY : So we 've got to pull together and squash the Wallace rebellion . Crush them like the squirming blue collar maggots they are . CROWD : Yeah ! Spumoni ? Ooh . We 're tired of taking orders from the rich , elite , well-educated , and better looking . We want people in charge like us . Yeah ! Corn dogs ? Ooh ! If Wallace pulls out a water balloon , we pull out a fire hose . He sends one of ours to the cleaner 's , we send one of theirs through the car wash , 'cause that 's the Donnelli way . Yeah ! Now let 's get out there and kick some Donnelli kiester ! Yeah ! [ CAR HORN ] Oh . [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ] [ WATER SPRAYING ] No ! My suede jacket ! [ SHOUTING ] Mochaccino , please . No . Oh , god . Please . Wyatt , you 're my best friend . Nothing personal . It 's just business . Don 't make it hurt . Do it quick . Do it quick . I don 't want to suffer . [ SHOUT ] AL WALLACE : Special delivery . [ THUD ] What is it ? What- - what is it ? It 's a message . Those bastards . Time to talk to Dad . About this war . Everybody is suffering . My brother , my best friend . And I 'm still scraping paint off my nipples . It 's gone too far . The honor of the family above all . They could hit you next , Dad . I 've already been hit . At the country club yesterday , someone tampered with the brakes on my golf cart . I ended up in the fourth hole water hazard . A pair of good jay loafers destroyed . Then stop this madness before they key your jag . I 'm glad to see such wisdom in one so young . I will respect your wishes . I 'd like to thank all the families for gathering here today in the spirit of cooperation . And I hope we can settle our differences here today . You can settle my rusty butt . [ SHOUTING AND ARGUING ] Hey ! Guys ! Hey , everybody ! ( SCREAMING ) Shut up ! There you go , sweetie . What 's the matter with us ? Your family sucks . I 'm serious . We 're ready to beat each other senseless . We 've got to stop this . Otherwise , where 's it all going to end ? Gun play ? [ MUMBLES ] All right . Good thinking , bro . I guess these things are good for more than just accessorizing . Let 's play . Don 't you people know a rhetorical question when you hear one ? Put those guns away ! Then how are we going to solve our differences ? The old-fashioned way . The Donnellis versus the Wallaces in a contest of skill . Winner takes the neighborhood . [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ] GARY WALLACE : Pressure 's on , Dad . This is the big moment for the Wallace family . Don 't worry . Follow my lead , boy . We 'll show those chumps some Wallace magic . [ GUNSHOT ] Oh ! Charlie horse ! He went down like a sack of lard . I smell joke . GARY WALLACE : Oh man , we 're dead . The hell you say . I didn 't spend six months strapping that fur flex for nothing . Now you shut up and dig in , you big hole . Hee ya ! [ THUD ] Sorry about that , Ma . Oh , you . We got him , Ma . He 's on the ropes . That 's right , honey . Like your father always says , no force on Earth can stop a determined Wallace . Oh look , a ladybug . [ SHOUT ] [ THUD ] Crush the white-collared scum . Come on , Wy . You 're better than he is . You 're better than his whole family . Bite his frickin ' nose off . Is it me , or is this getting ugly ? You know , my hands are starting to hurt . Tell me about . I got rope splinters up to my elbows . You thinking what I 'm thinking ? Get him . We let go through on the count of three . BOTH : One , two- - [ ZAP ] [ THUD ] Wyatt wins ! Hurray for Wyatt ! WYATT DONNELLY : No , no , no . Wait , hold on . I didn 't meant to win . No ! No , don 't- - CROWD : Donnelli , Donnelli , Donnelli . And so I retire with a happy heart and turn the family over to Wyatt , the new Don Donnelli . [ APPLAUSE ] My first act as Don is to apologize to the Wallace family for the injustices done to them . Our son has betrayed the family . Oh , I think not . And to insure an end to all hostilities , I would like to introduce my co-godfather , Gary Wallace . [ APPLAUSE ] Co-godfather ? Me ? Congratulations , Gary . I 'm sorry everything got so crazy . When I asked Lisa for the perfect family , I never thought I 'd end up losing my best friend . You 're not going to kiss me , are you ? Nah . Good . My son , perhaps we do not say it enough . But know that you have always made us proud . As proud as we are , one thing troubles me . With the homeowners association disbanded , how will the family earn a living ? Honest work . We 'll open a Sbarro 's franchise at the mall . Excellent . I love Italian food . Of course , the mall has traditionally been Pizza Hut territory . We 'll put in a take out order they can 't refuse . What about the building codes ? Taken care of . I know a guy . Just when I thought I was out , they pull me back in . [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ] [ THEME MUSIC - OINGO BOINGO , " WEIRD SCIENCE " ] Weird science , fantasy and microchips , shooting from the hip , something different will make weird science . Ooh ! Pictures from a magazine , bits and pieces , bits and pieces- - pieces- - pieces- - My creation . Is it real ? It 's my creation . I do not know . It 's my creation .

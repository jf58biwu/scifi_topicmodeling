 [ People chattering ] ( man ) Oh , he 's my favorite . Thank you . I 've always wanted to do this . After we eat , we have to rent a car and go check out the stars ' homes . At least there 's something to do here . It 's already better than Buttonwillow . Buttonwillow , Lemoore , Wasco . I never knew there were so many dreadfully dull pieces of dirt in California between here and San Francisco . Well , Professor , you 'd better get used to it . Because with Logan 's spectrum in our timer , we can pretty much land anywhere within a 400-mile range . ( Rembrandt ) Yeah . It was bad enough when it was same place , different dimensions . Now this . How do we know for sure this is Hollywood ? ( Wade ) Rembrandt . ( Rembrandt ) So that says " Hollywood . " For all we know , this could be Fresno on this world . ( Wade ) What difference does it make ? Wherever we are , we 're in Hollywood . And we 've only got two days . So let 's have some fun , okay ? ( Quinn ) I 'm with Wade . Let 's just relax . ( Professor ) Lead on , Miss Wells . Wherever you go , we shall follow . Oh man , Lionel . I knew I should 've taken that gig when The Commodores offered it to me . Dolly Parton ? I love her . Quinn ... ( Quinn ) Okay . Is it wound ? All right . Are you ready ? Yup . One , two , three . [ Giggles ] Thank you . ( Rembrandt ) Look at that . That wallet wouldn 't last one minute on our world . ( Wade ) Rembrandt , wait a minute . Something about that is saying , " Leave me alone " in a major way . Something , perhaps , to do with the security cameras that are trained on us at present . Guys , it 's just a wallet . Somebody 's got to be missing it . We should at least check it for ID . [ Woman yells ] [ Exclaims ] It 's loaded . Must be over $ 300 in here . ( Rembrandt ) Why don 't we just move on , Q-Ball , huh ? I 'd , uh , put it back down , Mr. Mallory . ( woman ) Hey ! [ People chattering ] ( Quinn ) What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds , where it 's the same year , and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? ( voice ) Sliders . [ People chattering ] ( Quinn ) Professor , I cannot believe that you allowed Wade to talk you into doing this . Or I you , Mr. Mallory . Okay , wait . Listen to this . Some of these people are stars . But Arnold Stang , Jill Whelan , Linwood Boomer ? I 've heard of Linwood Boomer . He was the blind guy on Little House . He was never anything of a star . At least , not on our world . Obviously , he fared better here . I gotta tell you , that 's what I love about sliding . Each world 's a new opportunity , a second chance to get your dream . ( Skip on TV ) That 's all later today on The Judgment Game . Don 't miss the next episode of America 's number-one game show . The only show that lets you be the judge . All righty , see you then . ( man # 1 ) Yes , I bet $ 10 , please . All right . ( man # 2 ) $ 50 . Make it $ 60 . It 's so weird how they leave their purses and wallets out . Anybody could just run and grab them . It 's clear they have no crime on this world . I guess that 's why there 're no locks on the doors in this place . It 's like that thing with the wallet today . The way those people were looking at me , it 's like they were afraid . " Terrified " is more like it . What do you think could scare people like that ? This could . [ All laughing ] What about this ? [ People chattering ] ( Wade ) What are they watching , anyway ? Seems to be some kind of game show . From the way they 're cheering , you 'd think it was the Olympics or something . What you got , Professor ? I don 't know . The barman said to have it back in five minutes to place the bet . " Martinez , conviction , 5-to-1 . " Conviction ? What is that , the name of a horse ? No . Not unless it 's running in every race . [ Sighing ] Stepping up , Mallory ? New bar , new friends , new girl ? I bet Deanne 's crying over her tip jar at Punky Pink 's . ( Quinn ) Who ? Break her heart to hear you say that . You 're not even gonna try to run , are you ? What are you doing ? My job . Hey , let him ... [ buzzing ] ( Wade ) Rembrandt , are you all right ? [ Quinn grunts ] [ Gun fires ] Let 's get out of here . ( Professor ) What 's going on ? What right do you have to arrest that man ? I have all the authority I need . Interfere and you 'll be playing the game , too . I 'll take care of Remmy and meet you out front . Strangest thing . I just went out . [ People chattering ] ( woman ) Ericka , find your brother . Which way did they go ? No idea . I 'm gonna find a police officer . Oh , don 't bother . According to the people in the bar , she can yank you off the street anytime she wants . Nonsense . He hasn 't done anything . Well , nonsense or not , she 's got him . She took him to a place called " the show . " The bartender gave us the address . He also said to hurry up before it 's too late . Come on . [ Car honking ] ( Taryn ) Come on , Mallory . Move it . I 'll beep you when I need you again . I always knew you were trouble . I never figured stupid . How many times have you played now ? Two , three ? You always get caught . I 'm not who you think I am . You 're right . The Mallory I know never would have done this . ( Phil ) I don 't believe it . Is that Mallory ? And I was beginning to think you were losing your touch . I told you , one , maybe two days . He 's not that big of a challenge . Who 'd you get for backup ? Greg Hughson . I already covered his expense . Excellent , Taryn . Well done . You 're the best . You know what ? I 'm gonna make a change . I 'm gonna put you on today 's show . Why don 't you come on into my office and I 'll , uh , settle up with you . What is this ? You a bounty hunter ? Contestant coordinator . What the hell is that ? Don 't I get to see a lawyer ? ( Taryn ) What is it with you today , Mallory ? How many times do I have to tell you ? I 'm not your Quinn Mallory . I 'm telling you , I didn 't do this . Whatever you think I did , I can explain . Just give me a chance ! ( Quinn ) You 're making a mistake ! You 've got the wrong guy ! They 're pathetic right before they play , aren 't they ? [ People applauding ] ( Skip ) .. they 're about to be saved ? ( Wade ) Are you sure this is the right place ? ( driver ) You want The Judgment Game , right ? This is where they tape . [ Crowd cheering ] ( Skip ) Okay . Get ready . Now , it 's time to pay the piper for your late night spray-paint escapade . [ Crowd cheering ] ( all ) One , two , three , four , five ... We 'd better find Quinn , and quick . ... six , seven , eight , nine ... Sorry , guys , the audience is already seated . Please , we must get in there . Not today . No seats available . Look , you don 't understand . Our friend ... I guess you would call him a contestant ... Are you his advocate ? Yeah . Will that get us in ? Only one advocate is allowed to speak per contestant . Hello ! Ladies and gentlemen , please . Welcome to the show ! [ Audience applauding ] All right ! All right ! It is time to play ... ( audience ) The Judgment Game ! Yes , indeed . We 've got a big show today , so let 's bring out our first contestant . You 've seen him before : A welder from San Francisco , a fugitive at large . Let 's give a big hand for a returning contestant : Quinn Mallory ! [ Audience applauding ] Today we are going to try him for murder ! ( Wade ) Murder ? He can 't be serious . ( Rembrandt ) You wanna bet ? They love you . Welcome back ! As always , you 're the judge . Guilty or innocent ? Will he live or die ? You 'll decide , right after these messages . [ Audience applauds ] By the power vested in me by the State of California , I hereby declare you , the viewing audience , the jury . ( Skip ) Pay close attention . A man 's life is at stake . Mr. Mallory , you have the right to be represented by the advocate of your choice . Should you fail to have an advocate present in the studio , one will be provided for you . I am told that you do have one . Is that correct ? I don 't believe this . Yes , I do . Well , get him out here . [ Audience booing ] What is your name , sir ? I am Prof. Maximillian Arturo . Do you swear that you are not now , nor have you ever been an attorney , that you 've never been to law school , nor have you ever taken the LSATs or prepared for the bar in any way ? I do . All righty . And now , the People 's Proponent . Ladies and gentlemen , straight off the set of his new hit comedy , please welcome Laurence Hilton Jacobs . [ Audience cheering ] Hi , there . We have two counts grand theft , assault with a deadly weapon , two felony drunk drivings , and all of that before the age of 21 . This is nonsense . Your Honors , the Evidence Code clearly states that prior criminal actions cannot be used to prove a subsequent crime . I object to this . You what ? I object . He objects ! [ Audience booing ] Is it any wonder lawyers were banned ? Mr. Arturo , consider yourself warned . Now , get back there and wait your turn . As you were saying , Laurence ? Let 's get to the heart of the matter . [ Drum roll ] [ All booing ] ( all chanting ) Guilty , guilty , guilty , guilty , guilty , guilty , guilty , guilty , guilty . Guilty , guilty , guilty , guilty , guilty , guilty . [ Audience cheering ] Skip , the People rest . This is a disaster . He 'll never get out of this . Don 't sweat it . That tape doesn 't mean anything . Why not ? I mean , it looks awfully convincing to me . Damn convincing . But you gotta remember he 's not the first guilty guy that 'll beat a murder rap . After all , this is an L.A. Audience . [ Crowd cheers ] Anything can happen . I see why the professor hates L.A. We just can 't stand around here and do nothing , huh ? Come on , there 's gotta be a way in somewhere . What do you think the penalty is for illegal entry here ? It doesn 't matter . I 'm willing to risk it . Taryn 's gotta be willing to talk to us , right ? Yeah . Willing or not , she 's going to . This way . I guess we can 't go that way . Yeah . [ Tape rewinding ] Wade , what 's that sound ? Editing rooms . Come on . Help me . Shh . I 'll meet you back out front , okay ? Okay . You be careful . [ People speaking indistinctly ] [ People chattering ] This is the finest young man it has ever been my privilege to know . He 's a brilliant student . He has lived an exemplary life . He comes from a very good home . [ Crowd jeering ] Perhaps this is a good time to pay some bills . Don 't tune away , folks . We are just minutes away from a vote . Back in a moment . This mob only wants entertainment . It doesn 't give a damn about the truth . They couldn 't handle the truth . Then we 'll make the truth entertaining , Mr. Mallory . We 'll tell them exactly who we are and how we came here . Instill a little bit of reasonable doubt . You can 't . You 'd be putting yourself at risk . Mr. Mallory , your life is on the line . I 'll take a chance if it means giving you one . [ People chattering ] Excuse me . I need to talk to you . How did you get in here ? Really not the point right now . Look , you ... you 've got the wrong guy . The Quinn you brought here , he 's not capable of ... What is it with you people ? You all have this bizarre fixation that Mallory isn 't Mallory . I know who I brought in , and it 's him . It 's not . Come on , there 's gotta be something different about him : His attitude , the ... the way he looks . Maybe your Quinn 's got a tattoo . My Quinn ? That 's what I 'm trying to tell you . We 're not from around here . I know that . He 's from San Francisco . No , it 's ... it 's a lot bigger than that . We 're from another world . It 's kind of like another dimension . I don 't need to hear this . No , wait ! I know I must sound crazy but if you 'll just give me a minute to explain ... Don 't bother , it 's too late . He 's already on the show . You see , not only did we find doorways to parallel universes , but we also discovered that on a lot of these other Earths , there were doubles of each of us . You know , like , uh , twin versions of ourselves . [ Crowd applauding ] Yes . Doppelgangers , if you will . And that brings us to the heart of the matter : This man is not the man you saw on that tape . I 'm not even the Quinn Mallory of your world . And he is certainly no murderer . He merely happens to be your Quinn 's double . And that makes him no more guilty of this crime than anyone here today . Excellent strategy , Mr. Arturo . You definitely scored some points for inventiveness . Well , we aren 't done yet . Oh , I 'm afraid you are because that is all the time we have . Now it is time to ... ( all ) Vote , vote , vote , vote , vote , vote , vote , vote , vote , vote , vote , vote , vote , vote , vote , vote , vote , vote , vote , vote , vote , vote , vote , vote , vote , vote , vote , vote ... Don 't worry . This one 's a slam-dunk . That 's not it . There 's something going on . He 's different . It 's just the fear of conviction , Taryn . It 'll make them do anything . It 'll make ' em lie , it 'll make ' em beg , it 'll make ' em repent ... That 's what makes this show so great . ( all ) ... vote , vote , vote , vote , vote . Thank you , sir . And your judgment is : [ Drum roll ] Guilty ! [ Crowd cheering ] Quinn Mallory , choose your door . ( crowd chanting ) Two , two , two ! Mr. Mallory ? All righty , you all know what that means . ( crowd chanting ) The wheel , the wheel , the wheel , the wheel , the wheel , the wheel ... The wheel , the wheel , the wheel , the wheel , the wheel , the wheel . Number two ! Oh , too bad . Lethal injection was behind door number three . [ Crowd exclaims ] Don 't forget , everybody , tune in tomorrow for a special evening edition when we will carry out the sentence live . Do something . ( Skip ) Next up , Mary Margaret Peters , on trial for adultery . Back in a sec . Take a good , long look at me because this is what an innocent man looks like before he 's executed . You proud of yourself for being a part of this ? Or do you not give a damn as long as you get your money , right ? Let me go . I wanna see a judge . I didn 't do this . No way ! [ Grunts ] Stop it ! Stop it , I say ! That 's enough ! That 's enough ! ( Quinn ) Stop ! That 's enough . Professor ... Quinn , we 're gonna get you out of this , I promise you . Where are you taking him ? Where are you taking him ? This man is innocent ! This man is innocent ! Come on , man , tell me ! Where are you taking him ? [ Crickets chirping ] ( Wade ) Maybe we can still try for an appeal . We 've already been through this . Unless we can prove special circumstances ... I think being a double from another dimension should qualify . I agree with you . They don 't . Well , maybe you didn 't explain it right . Maybe you , with your two years of college poetry , could have done better . Come on , we 're all on the same side here . [ Door opens ] Here he comes . ( Rembrandt ) How 's it going , Q-Ball ? You all right ? ( Quinn ) I 've been better . What 's the plan ? How 're you guys getting me out of here ? What ? They 're taping us . Everything we say can be heard . What 's it for ? The half-hour special right before they take my head off ? Broadcast this , you vultures ! ( Professor ) Quinn ! It 's okay . ( Rembrandt ) It 's all right , man . He 's okay ! He 's okay ! Get off ! How much time till we slide ? ( Rembrandt ) We got 22 hours , 17 minutes . 17 minutes after I 'm executed . You 've gotta find my double . That 's the only way I get out of this . Find his double . I mean , where do we even begin ? [ Cell door closing ] Huh ? Remember at the bar ? Taryn , she ... she said something about a Deanne , and Punky Pink 's . Yeah . Yeah ? Yeah . I 'm having second thoughts . Maybe this isn 't such a great plan . You just don 't walk into a place like this and start asking questions . Yeah , I know , but ... Miss Wells , this isn 't the kindest ruse we could have employed . But time is of the essence . [ People laughing ] I got some extra . It 's fine . Deanne , right ? It depends who 's asking . My problem 's not with you . It 's with the creep . You took him back again , didn 't you ? Excuse me . Hey . Don 't pretend like Quinn 's not shacked up with you . Where else would the jerk go ? What 's he to you ? Nothin ' , now that he knocked me up and doesn 't want anything to do with me or the baby . What , you 're carrying it for him ? Look , all I want is an address , okay ? I need him to give me some fly money so I can get home . He does that , I 'm gone . He 's all yours . You think I want him ? I 'm tired of his baggage , honey . It never ends . Tell you what : Here , help yourself . He 's at my place , okay ? Here . Hey , tell him he 'd better be gone by the time I get home or I 'll have Joey help him move , okay ? [ People chattering ] [ Computer beeps ] I 've got something for you . New contestant . His name 's Golin . Word has it he 's somewhere in the Valley . And we will expect delivery in the a.m. Phil , do you ever wonder if some of these contestants are innocent ? Maybe I was right about you . Maybe you are losing your touch , huh ? [ Sighs ] [ Computer beeps ] [ People chattering ] ( Taryn ) Thanks . [ Wolf whistle ] What are you doing here ? Testing a theory . Take off your shirt . What ? Humor me . Turn around . What are you looking for ? Quinn Mallory was knifed in a bar fight a year ago . Took over 60 stitches . But there 's no scar , is there ? No . Q-Ball 's gonna lose his head in 10 hours . Where is this guy ? ( Professor ) Tomcats come home earlier . Where could he be ? ( Wade ) Maybe he 's out killing somebody else . Are you sure this is the right place ? For the hundredth time , yes . The mail is addressed to Deanne Bloch . This is definitely her house . Look , I 'm beat . We 're all tired . Why don 't we just be quiet for a while , okay ? [ Birds chirping ] Miss Wells , about what I said in the prison ... I , um ... It 's okay . Look , we 're both just worried . I know you did everything you could . I shall spend the rest of my life wondering whether I did . I 'm scared too , Professor . But you know what keeps me going ? You guys . Knowing that you 're here . Knowing that if that was me in there , you 'd do anything in the world to get me out . You know , Quinn knows that , too . He 's countin ' on us . So we can 't lose faith now . [ Tires screeching ] ( Rembrandt ) Is that him ? ( Rembrandt ) Okay , now ... Just let me do the talking , okay ? Young man , a word . What did I say ? ( Rembrandt ) Wait . Not again . What are you doing here ? ( Taryn ) Same thing as you . Trying to help your friend . I swear , Taryn , it wasn 't me . I wasn 't even in town the day that all went down . If you can 't prove that , you 're gonna be sorry you said it . Where was I ? Where was I ? I was ... I was with Chicago Bob and we were down at Del Mar racetrack all day . Yeah . There are some betting slips in my wallet . Right in the jacket on the bed . Right there . See ? Inside pocket . Race two , six , and seven . See ? You see ? There 's no way I could 've been all the way down in Del Mar then back up in some alley in Hollywood by 4 : 00 . Come on , Taryn , you know me . I 'm into small jobs . A heist here , a joy ride there , a couple of phony checks . I 'm not the type to kill some bum . Come on . We all saw the tape . It was definitely you . I don 't know how my face got on that tape , but I 'm telling you it wasn 't me ! I know how his face got on that tape . ( Professor ) Of course . ( Taryn ) What is that ? There is no way that that is me . That guy is huge . People got tired of reasonable doubt , criminals having more rights than victims . Yeah , that I get , but what about the game shows ? That just seems so bizarre . Not when you think about it . In the old system , justice cost the taxpayers a lot of money . By televising it , we earn money for the state , judgments are swift , crime is down , everybody 's happy . Everybody ? Are you ? What about the innocent people who lose ? People like Quinn . [ Computer beeps ] ( Taryn ) Oh , I was afraid of this . I can 't access the system . ( Wade ) Here , let me try . [ Typing ] How do you know how to do this ? This isn 't even a challenge . In my world , there 's a lot of online crime . Our protect programs are twice as complicated . The day I got in here , I saw this . I didn 't know what it was then . Watch this . They took Quinn 's head and put it on Phil 's body . I don 't believe this . Pretty shocking , isn 't it ? Give me the disc . Now ! Get out . How long , Phil ? You 've got other things to worry about right now , Taryn . You almost got fired in ' 93 when Justice Tonight knocked us out of the Top 10 . We needed a way to rack up our ratings , didn 't we ? Congratulations , you figured it out . [ Phil grunts ] Hey , get the gun . ( Taryn ) The escape alarm ! [ Alarm buzzing ] ( Taryn ) All the office doors have auto-lock . There 's no way out . The guards 'll be here any second . ( Wade ) Maybe they will , but we won 't . Come on . How do you think I got in yesterday ? [ Alarm continues buzzing ] ( Rembrandt ) How much time left ? ( Professor ) Two hours , 12 minutes . ( man on TV ) ... finest hour as a community forum . An event for the entire family . Don 't miss this special live edition of The Judgment Game , tonight , when Quinn Mallory pays for his crime . What has happened with these people , huh ? They 're talking about a man 's life . Have they lost it completely ? From our point of view , perhaps . But look at it from theirs . Here murder is so rare that it 's a national prime-time event . Families can sleep at night here without worrying if they 've locked the doors or not . If you lose your wallet in the street you can be sure it will be returned to you with its contents intact . So what 's so unusual about that ? Where we come from , you can lock your door with three locks throw in an alarm , and still get robbed by some hood with a Saturday night special . What the hell is a Saturday night special ? My point exactly . Wait a minute , Professor . Are you saying it 's okay that innocent men die so long as we can sleep with our doors unlocked ? No , I 'm saying it 's a question of balance . In our society , hundreds of thousands of lives every year are damaged by crime . Justice delayed is justice denied . Here , justice is instant , and they 've almost eradicated crime . Albeit at the expense of the occasional innocent man . That 's easy to say when you 're not that innocent man waiting on death row . [ Door opens ] We couldn 't get to Network Appeals . ( Professor ) Why not ? They 're all at a retreat in Sun Valley . Now , even if we could , it 's too late . There 's no time to stop it . ( Rembrandt ) We gotta do something fast . Yeah , we 're on to that . You have access to welding tools ? Baby , I got access to everything . ( Wade ) All right , come on . We 'll explain on the way . You better have access , you little slick-haired rascal . [ Guillotine blade thudding ] ( man ) Try again . [ Camera clicking ] ( guard ) Wait there . [ People chattering ] ( reporter # 1 ) All right , here he comes . Can we ask you a question ? No interviews . Get out of my face . No interviews . ( Taryn ) Stop . I 'm with the show . There 'll be no execution until he does a remote for the European affiliates . For all I care , the European affiliates can ... Just one interview . There 's not much time , so it won 't take long . It 's your call . ( reporter ) Can I have a word ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'll do this one . All right . Come over here then , please . ( reporter # 2 ) Quinn , come on ... ( Taryn ) I 'm sorry . You 'll have to wait out here . [ People chattering ] Man , am I glad to see you guys . The feeling 's mutual . You okay ? No time for this . Get him below . Hurry . ( Quinn ) What is that ? Your ticket out , compliments of your double . Come on , hurry up ! I 'm sorry . I misjudged you . ( Taryn ) I 'm sorry . I can 't tell you how much . This is safer with you . Okay . You need a hand , Mr. Brown ? It 's gotta be tighter or they won 't believe it . Okay . Five minutes . If everything goes right , that should be long enough . We 'll just drive out of here and ... [ shushing ] Something 's happening . It 's 10 after . Why haven 't you started ? Where 's the contestant ? Network interview . Who the hell authorized that ? Your coordinator . Get these doors open . ( Phil ) Tear them off the hinges , if you have to . [ Clanging ] Hurry . He 's getting away ! Quick , Phil . Untie me . ( Phil ) Find him . He can 't be far . What have we got here ? [ Engine starting ] [ Grunting ] Now what ? You got a Plan B somewhere ? ( Professor ) Jump , Taryn , while you still have a chance . ( guard ) Come on . Let 's go . [ Stammering ] What are you doing ? You wanted Plan B. This is Plan B. [ Tires screeching ] [ Creaking ] What 's going on ? ( Rembrandt ) We didn 't make it past the gate . Out the back . How much time ? A little under a minute . I 'm sorry . I had no idea there was a cliff here . I guess that 's why there 's not a fence ! Sure , because nobody in their right mind would try to escape this way . Guys , now is not the time . ( Phil ) Give it up , Mallory . You got no place to go . 10 seconds . You 're gonna have to have a little faith here . Follow me ! What the devil is he thinking ? Escaping . Come on ! Come on ! [ Rembrandt and Wade yelling ] Hey , anyone interested in an exclusive ? This whole show is fixed . ( all ) What ? [ Whooshing ] [ All yelling ] [ Rembrandt whooping ] What a rush ! ( Wade ) No kidding . Talk about your turbo slide ! You felt that kick , too , right ? Just as we entered the vortex . ( Wade ) Tell me , was that good timing or just incredible luck ? A little of both . Listen , is everyone okay ? Everything except for my heart . I thought it was gonna come right out about halfway down . ( Quinn ) Oh , no . She 's got a video camera . I will be right back . ( Professor ) Mr. Mallory . Come on . Don 't let him get arrested again . [ Birds chirping ] She actually gave it to you ? Not exactly . Quinn , you didn 't ... Of course not . I simply told her we were alien life forms from another world , and if she didn 't give me the tape , we 'd take her back home with us when we left . [ All laughing ] We look like alien life forms to her ? Mmm-hmm . How is that ? What exactly does ... Trust me short , green , and moldy is not a great look . ( Wade ) Quinn . ( Rembrandt ) Q-Ball . Wait a minute , man . Why did you run ? Q-Ball !

 Get away ! Shoo ! Get away . Shoo . R.B.P. To field base , come in . Field base , come in , please . This is Dr. Robert Torrence ... with the Bio Diversity Project ... requesting immediate evacuation from Sector Z15 . This is a medical emergency . Please respond . I repeat . Dr. Robert Torrence . Bio Diversity Project . Immediate evacuation from Sector Z15 . Hey , Bobby , you got some mail . Don 't waste my time . Both of us know I ain 't got nobody . Could be those Baptists from Annandale . I hear they 've been sendin ' fruitcake . Ugh ! Hey , Winston , you think this is funny ? What kind of crap you trying to pull here ? Get this thing out of my crib ! Winston ! Winston ! Winston ! Winston ! - When was he exposed ? - Eighteen hours ago . I 've never heard of anything incubating so quickly . Where 's the prison doc ? I wanna see the prison doc . We 're specialists , Mr. Torrence . What 's wrong with me ? - Five centimeters . They appear fairly uniform . - Basal temperature ? 103.5 . Oxygen saturation , 81 ยบ / ยบ . - What 's wrong with me ? - Try and relax , Mr. Torrence . We 're here to help you . Put the sheets in the cart . Make sure and get all them pillows too . I 'll be back in five minutes . We 'll be here . See that ? Like he couldn 't clear out of here fast enough . The whole cell block 's empty . And McGuire says they 're full up at the infirmary . Bringin ' in more beds . Yeah , well , it 's probably something going around . Maybe . What , you know something ? I know those sheets ain 't going to the laundry . McGuire says they 're going to some kind of incinerator . But the laundry pickup 's still happenin ' . According to my briefing , the prisoners escaped ... by hiding in a laundry cart . I don 't think the guards are watching enough prison movies . And they 're both serving life terms . Murder convictions . Everybody 's here . I thought this was about escaped prisoners . It is . Then who are the men in the funny suits ? I don 't know . It looks like some kind of decon situation . F.B.I. Run out of crooked politicians to sting ? Excuse me ? Mulder and , uh , Scully ? We have orders to work with the federal marshals on this manhunt . - Either you two ever run an escaped convict operation ? - No . Well , then you 'd be a real big help if you just tried to stay out of the way . We 'd be happy to , as soon as we can talk to someone who 's in charge . I 'm in charge here . Apparently not , or you 'd know why our involvement was requested . We don 't know why we 've been sent here . Maybe if we talked to the warden or someone ... Well , no one 's here . The prison 's been taken over by the National Guard . They 've closed off most of the facility . - Why ? - I don 't know why . Federal marshal 's business isn 't in here . It 's out there , trying to catch those two convicts . Where did this case originate , Scully ? Came out of Skinner 's office . Did he say why he gave it to us ? No . Why ? Well , this isn 't the type of thing the F.B.I. Normally gets called in on . I got a feeling we 're not being told the entire story here . I 've got the same feeling , Mulder . You think you can get in there and find out what 's going on ? I can try . Where are you going ? See if I can get in the way . Hey , you girls go with Mom . I 'll see you in a minute . Robert ? Robert ! Robert ! - Hey ! - Whoo-hoo ! - Robert ! - Whoo-woo-woo ! Hey ! - I 'm sorry . This is a restricted area . - Who are you ? Dr. Osborne . - Are you the prison doctor ? - No . - Who do you work for ? - The C.D.C. You work for the Centers for Disease Control ? What are you doing here ? Sir , I 'm a medical doctor ! I wanna know what 's going on here ! Sir , if you don 't let me in , a lot of people in Washington are gonna find out ... that you 're conducting a secret quarantine in here . - I 'm under strict orders . - So am I. All I can tell you is that there is a flu-like illness ... spreading among some of the prisoners . - How many people are infected ? - Fourteen men so far . - Any deaths ? - Ten of the fourteen . What are the chances the men who escaped are infected ? They just took off . Mulder . Mulder , it 's me . I 'm starting to get a picture of what 's going on here . - What did you find ? - There seems to be some kind of ... deadly contagion sweeping the lockdown population . Deadly ? How deadly ? Well , from what I 've seen so far , 36-hours-after-infection deadly . Is there a chance any of the escaped men were infected ? The exact nature of this thing or how it is spread is unclear . So is their exposure to it and any danger they might pose . I 'd say these guys are a danger in any event . - Let 's get this guy . - Call me as soon as you know anything . I don 't care who you are or what your business is . - I want you out of here right now . - Not until I get some answers . - You 're in violation of federal statutes . - I 'm a federal agent , sir . - Who were you on the phone to ? - To my partner , who needs to know if the men he 's pursuing are infected . - That information is unavailable . - Then I want to see charts , and I want access to the infirmary . You see what I let you see . Hello . I 'm free , baby . - Paul ? Where are you ? - Listen , I 'm gonna ... I 'm comin ' home . - What are you talkin ' about ? - I 'm comin ' to get ya . What ? What ? Yo ! Anybody in here ? Hello ! Hey , man , you okay ? You look messed up . - You can 't be down here ! - I need to know what these men are dying from . You said this was some kind of a flu-like illness . - Please ! These bodies should not be exposed ! - What are these ? Do all of the victims have these boils ? You 're burning the bodies . Why ? Dr. Osborne , wait ! Freeze ! Hands in the air ! Freeze ! Freeze ! Clear . We got a man down ! He 's alive . Attendant 's name is Angelo Garza . He took a nice crack to the head , but he 's talking . Yeah , well , lucky they didn 't kill him . Kid 's got a lot of hair . Probably absorbed the blow . He found one of the men in pain on the bathroom floor ... with a large boil on his face . There 's a contagion at the prison . These men could be infected . Get on the horn . See what anybody knows about that . All right , they took the kid 's keys , and they got in the safe . They got money , the kid 's car , possibly a firearm , and they got a big head start . - Any idea where they 're headed ? - Got 23 possible roads and thoroughfares . Either of these guys got a girlfriend ? I wish I could tell you , but those records are locked up in the prison . Till we can access them , this is Smokey and the Bandit . If they had girlfriends , they probably tried to call them . Did you think of that ? This is the operator . How may I help you ? I 'm a federal agent assisting in a manhunt for two escaped prisoners . My badge number is JTTO47101111 . I need to know the last call made from this booth . All right , sir . One moment , please . That number , 555 ... Can you repeat that , please ? 555 ... All right , thank you . We didn 't hear anything ! What 's going on here ? Hey , what are you guys doing here ? What the hell 's going on here ? Who authorized this ? - I didn 't do anything ! - Hey , did you guys know anything about this ? Hey , what 's going on here ? What 's going on ? Where are they taking me ? Who are you ? - Hey , did you order this ? - No ! - Then who the hell did ? - I don 't know . But there was a call made from that phone booth about two hours ago . I got an address and phone number from Dinwiddie County . Wait here , sweetie . I 'll be right back . Thought you were " B.S. Ing " me ! I 'm gone , sweet thing . - They ain 't never taking me back . - I ain 't gonna let them . Mommy ! Mommy ! I 'm comin ' , sweetie ! Daddy 's home . Come on . - I got somebody with me . - What ? What 's wrong with him ? What 's wrong with him ? I don 't know . He 's out of it . Hell , he 's burnin ' up . We gotta get him in the house . Yes , I 'm trying to trace the origin of a package ... that was sent to a Robert Torrence ... at the Cumberland State Correctional Facility in Virginia . Yeah , the package I.D. Number is DDP112148 . Sure , I 'll hold . Yeah . The package was sent from Wichita , Kansas ? Did you record the name of the sender ? Could you check that again , please ? - Yes , ma 'am , that 's what it says . - Thank you . Yeah . What do you know about Pinck Pharmaceuticals ? Uh , it 's one of , if not the biggest manufacturer of drugs in America . Why ? They sent a package to a prisoner here ... who may have been the first victim of the contagion . Any idea what was in the package ? No . It 's empty . Scully , from the description we got , one of the prisoners had a large , purplish inflammation on his face . That sounds like what I 'm finding on all the victims in here . Do you know what that means , Mulder ? Yeah . It could spread . I need to know more about it , how it 's transmitted . I 'm on it . Gotta go . Gotta keep movin ' . Paul ? Paul , he 's awake . Paul , come here . You gotta help me . I 'm burnin ' up here . Please . Paul ! Paul ! Paul ! Down , down , down ! F.B.I. ! We got one prisoner dead in the bedroom . The other one 's gone . Charlie , why don 't you get the boy ? Come with me . - Why ? What 's going on ? - Just come with me . What the hell is going on ? I 've been infected . And they 're not letting me out . - Entire prison 's been quarantined . - By who , the C.D.C. ? C.D.C. Has nothing to do with it . It 's the company . They 're behind everything . Pinck Pharmaceuticals . You work for Pinck Pharmaceuticals ? How did this happen ? We finance exploration of new species from the rain forest ... with potential drug applications . Three months ago , a field entomologist disappeared in Costa Rica . - Disappeared how ? - We 're not sure . He just sent us some samples of an insect . Like this ? I found this buried in one of the dead prisoners . Faciphaga Emasculata . We were interested in it because of a dilating enzyme it secretes . - Is this what caused the outbreak ? - No . No , not precisely . F. Emasculata is a parasitoid , a bug that carries the parasite . In this case , a deadly parasite that attacks the immune system . The pustules are part of the natural reproductive cycle . They 're full of the larvae that you see there on the scope . So the contagion only spreads when the pustules erupt . And the larvae that are expelled burrow into the new host . Agent Scully ... You were there when the pustule erupted on me , which means you may also be infected . Come in . Thank you for seeing me at this late hour , sir . - What is it , Agent Mulder ? - This case we 've been assigned , I believe we 've been misled . - Possibly deceived . - Deceived ? By whom ? Whoever originated the case . What is the accusation , Agent Mulder ? That Agent Scully and I were sent on this manhunt ... without knowledge of the existence or nature of a contagion . What is the exact nature of the contagion ? It 's deadly . It kills within 36 hours . One escaped convict was infected . He 's dead now . The other man may be infected , and he 's on the loose . Does anyone know how it 's communicated , whether it 's a virus or bacteria ? We just know that over a dozen men have died from it , and it appears to be highly contagious . - Then you don 't know much , Agent Mulder . - Why weren 't we told the truth ? We didn 't know the truth . What we knew would only have slowed you down . But innocent people could be infected ! - What you knew could 've prevented that . - How ? In 1988 , there was an outbreak of hemorrhagic fever ... in Sacramento , California . The truth would 've caused panic . Panic would 've cost lives . We controlled the disease by controlling the information . You can 't protect the public by lying to them . - It 's done every day . - I won 't be a party to it . How about you ? You 're a party to it already . How many people are being infected ... while you stand here not doing your job ? Ten , twenty ? What 's the truth , Agent Mulder ? Mulder . - Mulder , they 're enforcing a full quarantine . - What ? - Mulder , they 're enforcing a full quarantine . - What ? One of the epidemiologists who claimed to be with the C.D. C ... told me that this was no accident . Pinck Pharmaceutical is here trying to clean it up quietly . And the government would have to know about it . - Do you have proof of that ? - Why else would the National Guard be here ? They 're protecting Pinck Pharmaceutical . Hey , listen , Scully , I need to know how this happened . I want you to start documenting everything you can get your hands on . - People have to know about the cover-up . - The public ? - It 's a public health crisis . - Mulder , we can 't leak this . Not until we know more . The fugitive that you 're looking for , he might not even be infected . - Yeah , but what if he is ? - If this gets out prematurely , the panic is gonna spread faster than the contagion . Mulder , we can 't let this be known . What if someone dies because we withheld what we knew ? What if someone dies because we didn 't ? There 'll be a time for the truth , Mulder , but this isn 't it . Are you okay in there , Scully ? Yeah , I 'm okay . All I want you to worry about is capturing that fugitive . Take care of yourself , Mulder . If you 're not infected , you should leave immediately . And if I am ? The parasite is undetectable in the bloodstream . This is the only way to test whether or not you 've been infected . These uninfected insects act as incubators . The insect 's bite won 't infect you . The contagion can only be contracted through exposure to the larvae . How long will this take ? Thirty minutes . Then another two hours ... before the parasite reproduces enough for us to see it . Elizabeth ? My name is Fox Mulder . I 'm with the F.B.I. Where did Paul go , Elizabeth ? I don 't know . I think you do know . And I think you know why you 're in here . - How are you feeling ? - I 'm fine . Steve felt fine too . Didn 't take long for that to change . You 're just trying to scare me . You should be scared . If I were you , I 'd be scared . - You 're lyin ' ! - No . Paul is the one who 's lying . And if he 's infected , a lot of people are gonna die . If that 's true , how come it 's not on TV ? How come they 're not tellin ' everybody ? That 's not my decision . Well , whose decision is it ? You knew about it , and you didn 't say anything . Why should I tell the truth if you won 't ? Elizabeth , Paul is out there somewhere . I have to find him . Now , you can help me . Or not . He 's on a 10 : 00 bus to Toronto . She was supposed to be with him . That bus depot 's over a half-hour from here , even doing 90 . - Get the local P.D. I want every man they got ! - No ! No . They don 't know what they 're dealing with . If he 's infected , he could spread it . What we need now is control . Toronto , one way ? Yeah . - Ow . - Now , once we harvest the blood from the insect ... The toxins . They 're moving into my brain ... just like it did on the prisoners . I don 't have much longer . I need you to help me . What do you want me to do ? Go on . You have to complete the test . Why did you confide in me ? It 's not a secret I feel like taking to the grave . People have a right to know the danger we 've put them in . If your test comes back negative , you have to tell them . How can I prove it ? I don 't know . But if you don 't , it 'll just happen again . Don 't believe for a second ... that this is an isolated incident . Your attention , please . Bus number 953 , bus number 953 ... - Will you wait a second ? - I don 't wanna miss the bus . You see that ? They 're still loading your luggage . You 're not missing anything . You have enough time to give your mother a kiss good-bye . Wait . Ticket . Be careful . Say hi to UncleJay . Hey ! What 's the time ? Twenty to 10 : 00 . What are you doing ? This material has been confiscated ... and will be destroyed according to standard C.D.C. Procedure . You don 't work for the C.D.C. Where 's Dr. Osborne ? He told me what happened here . What happened here was unavoidable . Well , we 'll leave that up to others to decide . Dr. Osborne is dead . No one in this room will corroborate your story . Just be glad this thing is under control . He 's here . Bought a ticket to Toronto . - Son of a bitch . - And he 's infected . Mulder . Mulder , I think everything here is under control . You okay , Scully ? Yeah . Have you found the second prisoner ? Yeah . He 's headed to Toronto . He 's alive ? Mulder , listen to me . Everything here has been destroyed . Any evidence whatsoever of a cover-up has been incinerated . That prisoner is the last man ... who could possibly connect conspirators . But he 's infected . He 's gonna die . If you want the truth , Mulder , he 's gonna have to make a statement . Quick . No Talking . Hold your men back . - What ? - I 'm gettin ' on the bus . We 've got the situation controlled . That bus isn 't going anywhere . There are other passengers . The prisoner sees a uniform , he could panic . He panics and innocent people die . What do you wanna do ? I get on the bus , I take the seat directly behind the prisoner , I put my gun to his head , I make an announcement to clear the bus . Thank you . Uh , can you take your seat , sir ? Yeah , there 's supposed to be a man on the bus . Sir , I 've got a schedule to keep . Now , please , take your seat , or I 'm gonna have to ask you to get off . Take the key out of the ignition and turn around slowly . What is this ? I 'm with the F.B.I. I need to know if this man has boarded the bus . Yeah . That 's him . Right back there . Federal agent ! Drop your weapon ! Plan " A " has gone to hell . Get ready to move , people . - Let the boy go ! - Move the damn bus ! You got over two dozen U.S. Marshals out there , Paul . How far you gonna get ? I 'm dying , ain 't I ? The question is , how many people are you gonna take with you ? - What is this thing ? - You were infected in prison . What Bobby Torrence had . And your girlfriend Elizabeth and possibly your son . How many more people do you wanna expose ? It came from that package in Bobby 's cell , didn 't it ? You saw a package ? What the hell was it ? All right , everybody off the bus . Just keep going . Just go . Just go . Keep moving . All right , come on out . It 's okay . Come on , just slide out . I 'm here for you . Easy . Come here . All right . Go . Go on . All right , Paul , what was in that package ? Paul , what was in that package ? Apharmaceutical company was using you as a guinea pig . If you tell me what was in that package , I 'll make sure they don 't get away with it . Come on , Paul , you remember . Tell me ! Get him off the bus ! Get him out of there ! Keep your distance ! Make sure he 's down ! You have to get out . Let 's go . Get out . Robert Torrence was patient zero , the first prisoner to contract the disease . Just before being admitted to the infirmary , he received a package from Pinck Pharmaceuticals . They orchestrated this entire thing to circumvent years of F.D.A. Trials ... in order to get their drug on the market . - Why are you telling me this ? - I wanted you to hear it before you read it in the papers . I 'd seriously reconsider bringing this to the media , if that 's your intention . The public has a right to know so it doesn 't happen again . And you 're gonna prove this elaborate conspiracy ... with an empty package and a dead insect ? Leave it alone , Agent Mulder . The epidemic was contained . Eighteen people are dead . If you 're helping them cover the truth behind those deaths , then you 're just as guilty as they are . You really have no idea who you 're dealing with , do you ? I thought I was dealing with you . We can 't prove a thing , Mulder . - They 've made sure of it . - What are you talking about ? The Costa Rican government just faxed me the report on the missing scientist . His name was Robert Torrence , the same as our prisoner . It was their fail-safe in case it ever came to this ... so they can blame it on a simple postal error . A mistake . That 's why we were given this assignment , right ? They knew all along ... so that even if we succeeded in finding the truth , we 'd be discredited as part of it . Am I right ? - Am I right ? - You never had a chance , Agent Mulder . For every step you take , they 're three steps ahead . What about you ? Where do you stand ? I stand right on the line that you keep crossing . Come on , let 's go . Agent Mulder ... I 'm saying this as a friend . Watch your back . This is just the beginning .

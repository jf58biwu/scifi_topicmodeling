 Previously on " Lost " ... The plane was loaded with heroin . - He said he found it in the jungle . - Where in the jungle ? - It 's just a statue . - Just a statue ? Where is Charlie ? What 's this ? Because this was in your little statue . I didn 't know . Look , if it 's sealed up inside a statue , how would I know ? - You lied to me , Charlie . - I 'm sorry .

Charlie ! It 's okay . Hey . Hey . I made Aaron some nappies this morning . I 'll just put those there . Thanks . Has he been asking about me ? Charlie , don 't . I 'm sorry . I should have told you about the statue and what was in it . I just wish things could get back to the way they were before . There is no " before " , Charlie . We were strangers on a plane , and we became friends . Now Locke 's your friend , huh ? Please , Charlie , just for now , give me some space , okay ? Yeah . Space . See ya , mate . Take care of your mum now , okay ? - Charlie ? - Hey . - Hey . Hi . - Hey . What are you doin ' up ? You should be laying down . I just needed to see her again . Isn 't she brilliant ? She 's beautiful , Karen . I named her Megan . Where 's Liam ? He 's not here . Karen , look , it wasn 't his fault . We were leaving the club in dresden . I was in a cab . He was in a van with the gear , and he blew a tire on the way to the airport . He missed his flight , but he 's on the next plane , all right ? He 'll be here soon . But he 's okay ? He 's great . He 's a dad . Yeah . Oh , for the ... Liam ... Unbelievable . Liam ? Liam , wake up ! Hey ! What the hell 's wrong with you ? What the hell are you doing ? Hi , baby brother . You 're supposed to be cleaning up . Get up . I told Karen you missed your flight . She 's all alone at the hospital , and you 're here fixin ' . - What 's the matter with you ? - I 'm cool , I 'm cool , I 'm cool . I just needed to get right , that 's all . Don 't worry . I left you some . " Get right " ? Why don 't you get up ? Take a shower , get dressed , get to the hospital ? All right , all right , I 'm on it . I 'm on it . Oh , by the way , you have a daughter . Her name is Megan . After mum ? Yeah , after mum . Now clean yourself up . You 're a sodding father now . Easy . That 's good . That was good . Okay , one more . Uh , Sawyer , when you were over there across the island , how well did you get to know those tallies ? Well enough , why ? That Libby chick seems pretty cool . I mean , is she ? Whoa , you got a little love connection brewing ' over there , Jabba ? - No , just askin ' . - Yeah , I hear you askin ' . Forget it . What 's with you ? You 're acting like you 're in junior high . Well , what do we have here ? Looks like Ana Lucia 's gettin ' the $ 20 tour . That 's the third time I 've seen 'em walking ' out of the jungle . What do you suppose they 're doin ' out there ? Why don 't you just do your exercises , Sawyer ? Oh , bloody hell . Hey ! Hey ! The baby ! Help ! Help ! The baby ! Aaron ! Aaron ! I 'm coming ! I 'm coming , Aaron ! It 's okay . It 's okay . You 're safe now . I got you . It 's all right . It 's okay . You 're okay now . You 're safe . You 're safe . There you go . It 's okay . M um ? Claire ? He 's in danger . You have to save him . The baby 's in danger . You have to save the baby . You have to save him . The baby is in danger . The baby , Charlie . You have to save him . Charlie , only you can save him . You have to save him . Charlie ? What are you doing ? What ? What are you doing , man ? What 's goin ' on ? It 's the middle of the night . What are you doing with the baby ? I don 't know . Help ! Somebody stole my baby ! - Claire , what 's wrong ? - I don 't know ! Aaron 's gone ! It 's okay ! We 're over here ! Is he all right ? ! - Is he okay ? ! - Claire ... I don 't know what happened . I 'm sorry . He 's okay , though . I had this dream- - Stick ? I don 't know , dude . Don 't you need 21 ? I think you should hit . But I got a six . I 'm gonna bust . How do you know that ? Well , I don 't , but you gotta assume that I 'm gonna bust . Why ? Well , well , look who 's off to the laundromat . Well , go on . I 'm sure you 've got a load you need to drop in , don 't you , Jethro ? I 'm kind of waitin for my moment . Well ... your moment is now , Hoss . Hey , Libby ! Hey , yourself . Hey , John . Talk to you for a second ? Yeah . What is it , Charlie ? I take it you heard about what happened last night ? If you mean you taking the baby out of Claire 's tent in the middle of the night , yeah , I heard . This whole thing was a big misunderstanding , John . I was sleepwalking . I don 't know how or why- - Is there something you want from me , Charlie ? I was hoping you could speak to Claire for me , you know , put in a good word . - Are you using ? - What ? Heroin . Are you using again ? Kate sees a horse- - nothing . Pretty much everybody 's seen Walt wandering round the jungle . But when it 's Charlie , it must be the bloody drugs , right ? It 's funny , you didn 't answer the question . You remember the plane , John ? We burned it , Eko and me . We burned the whole thing- - the heroin , the statues . It 's all gone , destroyed . - All of them ? - All of them . Trust is a hard thing to win back . Claire needs time . You should leave her and the baby alone for a while . Can you do this ? You look green . Sod off . I 'm fine . All right , let 's give this another go , shall we ? Well , get it together , all right ? Lest you forget , we need this . Tea ? So you lads ready ? Yeah , we 're ready . Let 's go . Let 's try not to blow it this time , eh ? Thank you . - You good ? - Yeah . We 've only 20 minutes till we 're in overtime . Now get it right . All right ... Camera ... Rotate on the 8-count . Hold the product up . " Butties diapers , take 53 .. " Playback . And action ! Cut ! It 's all right . That 's it . We 're wrapped ! Wait , no ! Oi , mate , hang on ! Wait . Wait . What are you doing ? Let 's not waste any more time , shall we ? You were only hired as a favor to your lawyer . I wanted Dirt Spigot . Come on , mate . Give us another chance . You want another chance ? Take my advice- - ditch that one . He 's a bloody disaster . I 'm not ditching ' anyone . He 's my brother . Right . Well , then , I guess you 're fired . Is this washer and dryer newer than everything else in here ? It washes clothes . That 's all I need to know . Ah , finally . Someone who keeps it simple . Oh , hey , look at this . I got it in some of the abandoned luggage . You think I can pull this off ? Let me give you a hint- - uh , when a girl asks that kind of question , she 's looking for validation . Do I ... know you from somewhere ? You mean other than the flight ? Flight ... - Okay , turn around . - Huh ? Turn around . I wanna try it on . Turn around . Oh . Oh , sure , yeah . Go ahead . No peeking . I cannot believe you don 't remember stepping on my foot . I did ? Yes , you did , and it was hard . I know that because I remember you were the last one on the flight , and you were all sweaty , and you had headphones on and ... crunch ! You stepped on my foot . Okay , turn around . - What do you think ? - It 's awesome . Thanks . What are you doing ? I 'm marking trees . Why ? 'Cause these ... are the ones I like . Did you tell Locke you gave me one of the statues from the plane ? Why would I do that ? He knows , man . The bald wanker knows something . Something wrong , Charlie ? Apart from me losing my mind , no , everything 's just peachy . And why would you say you are losing your mind ? How about the fact that I 've been sleepwalking , stealing ' babies from their cribs ... Oh , yeah , and then there 's the vivid dreams that make me feel like I 'm completely awake until of course , I wake up . What are your dreams about ? Variations of Aaron being in mortal peril ... trapped in a piano , drifting ' out to sea ... and there 's the flying dove and Claire and my mom dressed as angels tellin ' me I need to save the baby . What ? Have you considered that these dreams mean something ? Like what ? What if you do need to save the baby ? I have to talk to her . You know , now 's not a good time , okay ? No , I have to talk to her . She 'll want to hear this . Okay , you know what ? Tell me , and I will tell her . Kate- - no , no ! Claire ! Claire , listen to me . Aaron 's in danger . - What are you talking about ? - The baby 's in danger ! Look , I 've been having these dreams . I know what they mean now . - Charlie- - - Kate ! Claire , listen , we have to baptize Aaron . What ? We can do this . Eko 's a priest . We can do this . You 've said your piece . It 's time for you to go . No , wait ! I 'm not leaving . Claire , we have to baptize Aaron ! Claire , he 's in danger . We 've got to do this ! We have to ! Here . For when it rains . Thanks . So when are you gonna tell me what happened in the jungle ? I already did . Pull it tighter or it 'll sag . You told me what that guy said . You didn 't tell me what made you turn around , what made you come back . He had a gun at Kate 's head . You hittin ' that ? What ? Plane crash ... you both survived ... nice beach ... she 's hot , you 're hot . It 's what people do . I 'm not " hitting ' that . " Hey . Karen kicked me out , man . What ? What happened ? She , uh ... she thinks I 'm dangerous . Why would she think that ? Because I dropped her . I dropped Megan . Oh . Hey , Liam . It 's all right . I 've got no money , got nothin ' . What are we gonna do ? - We 'll get through this . - Yeah ? How 's that ? I 'm writin ' again . I got a new song . It 's about two brothers . Two brothers who should 've been butchers . Don 't say that . It 's a good one . I feel like this might be the one . All right , listen to this , okay ? Nice , man . This could work . - It 's good , right ? - We could make it work . Write all night , just like the old days . - All right . - How about that ? So , baby brother ... do you got any ? I 'm disappointed in you , Charlie . You followed me ? How long you been comin ' out here ? John , you got the wrong idea , man . You said you destroyed them all , and yet , here they are . How is that the wrong idea ? I came out here to finish the job . I 'm gonna get rid of these right now . Yeah , that 's very convenient now that I 've found them . What are you doing ? There was a time when I let you choose whether or not you were gonna do this to yourself . Now I 'm making that choice for you . Oh , you don 't believe me ? Give ' em to me . Give ' em to me right now . I 'll destroy ' em . Look ! I 'll throw ' em in the sodding wind ! Look , John , I know I lied , all right ? Just wait . Wait , wait , John . Remember all those talks we had ? You and me , we said everything happens for a reason . This island tests us . That 's what this is , John- - A test . This is my test . That 's why these are here . These are here because you put ' em here , Charlie . No , wait . John , wait . What are you gonna do ? You gonna tell Claire ? You can 't . Look , if she sees them , I 'm done . She 'll never trust me again , and she has to , John . It 's about the baby , all right ? Aaron 's in danger . You have to believe me . You 've given up the right to be believed , Charlie . Hey . Hi . How 's our boy ? Oh , he 's good . Hey , John , can I ask you something ? Sure . Do you think , uh , Aaron and I could stay in the bedroom in the hatch for a while ? Pretty loud alarm goes off every hour and a half . It 's not the best place for a baby to sleep through the night . Oh , yeah , sure . How about if I move my stuff down here for a couple nights ? Set up right next to your tent ? That would be great . Thanks . Yeah , consider it done . Hey , John , you don 't ... you don 't know anything about baptism , do you ? Not a whole lot . Why ? Charlie came by my tent before and ... he told me Aaron had to be baptized ... that he was in danger . My understanding is that baptism is about making sure that children get into heaven , should anything happen . Call it " spiritual insurance . " There isn 't any danger , Claire . Charlie just ... Charlie just feels like he has to save the baby 'cause he can 't save himself . - I 'll see you tonight . - Okay . Charlie , can you give us a hand ? Now 's not a good time , Sayid . Let 's lift this . Okay , I got it . Fire ! Fire ! Grab tools , containers for sand , anything you have . If we don 't stop it now , it 'll burn right through the camp ! Stay here with Aaron . We need to cut a fire break right here ! Form a bucket line ! Some of you people , down to the water ! Sawyer ! We 'll hand ' em up . Wait here ! Liam ? ! My piano . What 's ... what 's going on ? Liam , where 's my piano ? - I sold it . - You what ? - Hey , wait , come on . - Get off of me . Where 's the money ? Is it up your sodding ' arm ? ! I 'm clean . I haven 't used in two days . Two days ? Well , happy anniversary ! Well , how long you been clean ? Where 's the money ? She was gonna leave me , Charlie . She was gonna take Megan . What did you do , Liam ? Karen 's got an uncle in Australia . He 's gonna get me a job . There 's a rehab clinic in Sydney . I just needed the money to get us there . I have to do this . I have to take care of myself , for them , for my family . I 'm your family ! - Wait . Will you just wait ? - I can 't , Charlie . What about the band ? What about the song ? Try to understand , I have to go . I have to . Look , I 'll give you a call when things settle down for me . For you ? What about me ? What about my family ? Charlie ! What are you doing ? ! I 'm doing what I have to do ! - He 's got my baby ! Stop it ! - No ! Claire , it 's all right ! - Charlie , stop ! - It 's not ... no ! I ... Help ! Help ! Somebody help ! He 's got my baby ! Help ! Help ! Come on , Charlie , please , stop it . I just want to save him ! Charlie ! It 's all right . Give me the baby . Eko , tell them ! Tell them , Eko ! Tell them what you told me , that the baby has to be baptized ! This is not the way . Charlie ... come on , give him to me . Who the hell are you , John ? ! Aaron 's not your responsibility ! Where were you when he was born ? ! Where were you when he was taken ? ! You 're not his father . You 're not his family ! Neither are you , Charlie . I have to do this , I need to . I 'm not gonna hurt him . You 're hurting me , Charlie . Claire . I 'm sorry- - You need stitches . - Try to be still . - Yeah . I started the fire , Jack . Yeah , I know . I was desperate . She didn 't- - I need to know you 're never gonna do anything like this again , ever . I know what this looks like , what people think . It doesn 't matter now , but ... I didn 't use . I wanted to . I really wanted to . But I didn 't . That 's not what I asked , Charlie . It 's not gonna happen again . Charlie told me you 're a priest . Yes . He said that you told him that I had to have- - I did not tell Charlie to do what he did . I 'm sorry if he misunderstood . But do you think the baby has to be baptized ? Do you know what baptism is ? It 's what gets you into heaven . It is said that when John the Baptist baptized Jesus , the skies opened up , and a dove flew down from the sky . This told John something- - that he had cleansed this man of all his sins , that he had freed him . Heaven came much later . I haven 't been baptized . And does that mean that if you do it to Aaron , and something happened to us , that we wouldn 't be together ? Not if I baptize you both .

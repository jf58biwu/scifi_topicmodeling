 [ Grunting ] [ Sighs ] You haven 't seen a very large F-class cruiser around here , have you ? It 's my ship , uh - I 'm the pilot . So could you tell me where my ship is ? Come on , man . Help me out . This isn 't one of those dreams , is it ? 'Cause I don 't have dreams . I haven 't dreamed in decades . Now what the hell is this ? Get me out ofhere . I am a pilot . I gotta fly . [ Grunts , Yells ] [ Shuddering ] I 'm still here . I 'm still here . [ Yale Narrating ] Sunrise on the space stations was manufactured by computers , an artificial light . Here , the sun rises of its own volition , like most things on this planet , beyond human control . So , another unsuccessful stop , huh ? Why should today be different from any other day ? We came here because we thought this forest might yield some edible vegetation , but - Nothing ? Julia tested everything . [ Inhales ] Yale , we have to do something . We estimated the food supply would last eight months . It 's been four weeks and we 're already one-third depleted . I don 't know . Maybe you misjudged the effect hiking across a continent can have on a person 's appetite . We will find food , Devon . Not here , we won 't . We got to get going , okay ? [ Yale Narrating ] Not only does this planet challenge us , but we challenge each other . When we crashed here , each of us barely knew the others existed . Now suddenly , we 're a body with 1 7 very different heads . Bring me more . More of everything . Gravy . Whatever you got in the kitchen back there . More . [ Bell Rings ] Mmm . [ Makes Eating Noises ] Mmm . Mmm . Come on , Morgan . [ Chuckles ] Oh . Mmm . Morgan ? Morgan , enough fun . Oh . Oh . Mmm . Oh . Mmm . Mmm . Bess , I 'm trying to get the trans-rover packed and us moving . We cannot be waiting for you two anymore , okay ? Well , we 're doing our best , Devon . Why don 't I believe that ? Devon , Morgan 's just trying to cope . I mean , he wasn 't exactly ... cut out for this sort of travel . He is an adult , Bess . I don 't want to tell you your business , but why don 't you treat him as one ? Mmm . [ Smacks Lips ] [ Electronic Screeching ] Oh . Hey . Hey , that 's very dangerous . Well , I 'm sorry , Morgan . I could get brain damage , you doing that . I just - I just can 't believe that woman . The way she talks to us like we 're idiots , just because I 'm an Earth girl . I was enjoying the most beautiful lamb shank , Bess . Well , Morgan , if you 'd pull your weight a little bit , I wouldn 't have to run interference all the time . Interference ? You 're not running interference . How would you know , Morgan ? You 're always on your V.R. gear . So I have a hobby . So then pack up the tent yourself . Now , Morgan . [ Electronic Screeching ] Hey . I made some adjustments to your brace so it won 't hurt as much . What 's wrong with you ? Doc , I can 't take being trapped here anymore on this planet . You gotta hibernate me . Give me something to put me under . What ? At least until my leg heals . Alonzo - I used to be a pilot . I could fly away whenever I wanted . But here , day to day - Then the dreams . Please , just - just put me to cold sleep . You can thaw me out when we get to New Pacifica . [ Sighs ] Okay ? How old are you ? About 1 09 , 1 1 0 . Why ? And since you left flight school , what 's the longest stretch of time you 've been awake ? Probably the last few weeks . And it 's hell . I don 't wanna be here . You 're depressed . Thanks for the analysis , Doctor . Are you gonna put me under or not ? Are you out of your mind ? Even if I could engineer the metabolics , we don 't have the power to maintain a chamber . Alonzo , this place is new for all of us . No one 's gonna want to drag you , sleeping , across the planet . It can 't be done . It shouldn 't be done . No wonder I 'm afraid of the dreams . Don 't wanna see the Terrians ... or you . You dreamed about me ? When ? More of a nightmare . [ Walman ] Grendler in camp . ! Watch it . ! Perimeter alert . [ Chattering ] What do you think it wants ? How should I know ? Don 't get too close . I 've got a bad feeling about these things . [ Grunting ] - Walman , you got that gun handy ? - Just say the word . - Don 't you think we should ask questions first and then shoot ? - Devon , he 's got something . - [ Grunting ] - It 's some kind of fruit . I think he wants to give us some food . Thank you . He just - He wanted to give us some food . [ Roaring ] [ Chattering , Screaming ] [ Devon ] No , don 't - [ Magus ] Careful . [ Groans ] [ Grunting ] See , I told you they were dangerous . You all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Wish I could say the same for our rail . [ Softly ] Morgan . [ Bird Warbles ] [ Bird Warbles ] [ Bird Warbles ] Morgan ? [ Bird Warbles ] Morgan , is that you ? [ Grunting ] Well , aren 't you just the most interesting looking fellow ? Oh . [ Sighs ] We just can 't get a day 's relief , can we , Dad ? You said it , True girl . Danziger , can you fix it ? He can fix most anything . Just a question of how long . Well , how long do you think this 'll take ? Seems to me a couple hours . Better make that overnight . Overnight ? Danziger , we can 't afford to wait that long . [ Mumbles ] I 'm not the one who approached the creature , am I ? Excuse me ? He said , " I 'm not the one who approached the creature . " Well , then we should organize a search party and start looking for some of that fruit . [ Bess ] Hey , Devon . Look , everybody . Look what I 've got . Bess , where did you get that ? From the nicest Grendler . He just gave it to you ? Of course not . I traded for it . You know , just like we did down on Earth . If someone needed something and they didn 't have funds , we would barter . Well , we should be careful with it . We don 't know anything about it yet . Bess , those Grendlers are very dangerous . You could have been killed . Besides , what could you possibly have that a Grendler would even want ? Morgan , um , I-I think we should talk about that in private . Oh , Bess . Bess , you didn 't - [ Gasps ] You didn 't trade my V.R. gear , did you ? It was for food , Morgan . And at the time , it seemed like the right thing to do . Excuse me . It 's mostly glycosaccharide and fibroin . There 's some proteins , but I don 't see any identifiable toxins . Yes , but is it edible ? I can 't say for sure . It could interact harmfully with stomach enzymes and microbes . - Certainly wouldn 't want it to burn a hole in anyone 's stomach . - Don 't touch that , Ulysses . Please . It looks better than that gross spirulina . Not untilJulia says it 's okay . Well , I guess there 's only one way to see for sure . I wouldn 't . Julia , don 't . That was very irresponsible , Julia . I have a strong stomach lining . It 's part of my genetic enhancement . - It 's a bit tart , but it 's nice . - How do you feel ? Mmm . Not bad , actually . I could get used to this stuff . I think everyone should try just a little bit . Excuse me . I 'm late for a session with Alonzo . Good work , Bess . Thank you . Bess , the fruit that you brought us , it 's edible . Well , I could have told you that , Devon . - What do you mean ? How do you know ? - I ate a whole one on the way home . [ Clicks Tongue ] Bess , what is the likelihood that you can lead us back to the Grendler ? Perhaps we can trade for some more fruit . [ Julia ] Good . You 're doing well . [ Breathes Heavily ] [ Grunts ] Alonzo ? Are you all right ? [ Groaning ] Take it off . I don 't want it ! I don 't want it . I am not the enemy . I am trying to help . You get in my skull and get rid of these dreams , and you tell those monsters to get out of my head . I would if I could . Oh , you would . I 'm sure there 's a very logical explanation for the preponderance of R.E.M. activity that you 've been experiencing . You took all those cold-sleep missions , and obviously your subconscious has been impaired . They really forgot the bedside manner chromosome when they made you , didn 't they ? Didn 't they ? Fine . - Obviously , you 're dead set on being miserable . - I 'm glad you noticed . Far be it for me to stand in your way . Just let me know when you 've grown up . Well , good . Run out of here . I don 't need you . Thanks for everything . Where have you been ? Oh , with Devon and Yale . I 've got a job to do with them . Really ? Hmm . Hey , I thought we didn 't like Devon . You said she treated us like idiots . Well , Morgan , I happen to care about the group , and they need me to trade for some more fruit . Well , what are you gonna trade away this time , Bess ? Me ? You gonna trade your husband away for a few magic beans ? Huh ? Morgan , I told you . I 'm sorry about your V.R. gear . Well , you should be . It was keeping me alive , Bess . You know I need every escape I can get . Okay , Morgan - What ? I 'm not gonna talk to you if you take that tone with me , Morgan . What ? I know you valued your V.R. gear very much , Morgan . Yes . I had a chance at making contact with a whole nother life-form . I 've never done that before , Morgan . [ Mutters ] [ Grunts , Panting ] [ Whistling ] [ Whistles ] Bess , we 've been trying for over an hour . - Maybe he 's moved on . - Just give him a little time . You guys , we came out to barter with him , and I think we should barter with him . He just needs to be wooed a little . [ Whistles ] It 's a noble experiment , Bess , but we must be aware of the possibility that he might be leading us into some sort of ambush . - He 's not . - We don 't know that for sure , Bess . I do know . Other Grendlers might be dangerous , Devon , but he 's not . He likes people . I think I see him . [ Grunting ] I think you guys better let me go in alone . He only trusts me . I don 't think it 's safe for you to be alone with that creature . Devon , it 's gonna be okay . I 've traded with this Grendler before . Besides , we don 't have a choice . We need the fruit . [ Sighs ] All right . All right.Just be very careful , okay ? A-And be sure that you get the most you can for our stuff . Don 't worry , Devon , I 'm not gonna hand everything over for a couple of pieces of fruit . - I know how to trade . - Of course you do . - We have our gear , so we 'll be able to stay in close contact . - Okay . Okay . Let 's get started . Be careful . Do you know how to use the gear ? Devon , you 'd be amazed at the things I know . All right.Just speak clearly a-and stay online . [ Headset Beeps ] [ Headset Beeps ] [ Grunts , Yells ] [ Grunts ] [ Yale ] Bess , does he have any fruit ? Can you give us P.O.V. scan ? Explain that means you turn the eyepiece away . Yale , tell Devon I know what P.O.V. scan means . - Fruit ? - [ Grunts ] I 'll trade you this nice lumalight ... for a piece of fruit . [ Grunting ] [ Yale ] Does he understand ? Show him the features . See ? It 's an alloy , kind of like the V.R. gear I gave you . And it has a light too . My God . What ? What ? [ Grunts ] Uh-Yale , Devon , I don 't think he needs any more lumalights . He has more than we do . [ Devon ] Those are the supplies from our cargo pod . We should take it all back then . Forget bartering . I don 't really think we 're in a position to do that right now . He , uh - [ Chuckles ] He 's actually , um , pretty attached to our possessions , and , uh , I don 't think we should upset him right now . Bess . Bess , go back where you were . To the right - To the right , at about 3 : 00 . Okay . Yale . Yale , it 's our hoverscout . Tell her not to let the Grendler see how much we need that . - Devon , do you know what we have in here ? - Bess . Bess , go get the hoverscout . With that , we could track down orchards of fruit . Please . Devon , are you sure we want that scout thing ? I mean , we have a , uh , geolock box in here . Make the trade , Bess . Just make the trade . Offer him the spare survey scanner . We can return for the rest of the goods . Yale , it doesn 't look like he needs any more gadgets . [ Grunts ] [ Drawn-out Grunt ] Alonzo , I brought you some pain-blockers . [ Softly ] Although at this point , I 'd rather see you suffer . Alonzo ? Are you in there ? [ Yale ] Activate hover . Commence levitation . Hover activate . [ Bess ] Devon , what is it ? It 's a remote aerial scout plane with a 50K range and a homing function , but , uh - Maybe we made a bad trade , huh ? Well , can we fix it ? I don 't know . It 's not your fault , Bess . You did a great job . You really did . Well , I can go back . You know , actually there was a box in there that I recognized , and I think - Devon , can I speak to you for a moment ? Sure . Uh , excuse me . [ Devon ] When did you last see him ? Noon , maybe . Noon ? Julia , that-that 's almost eight hours ago . I know . I was giving him time to cool off . We had an argument . He was feeling sorry for himself . He 's been depressed . I don 't think he 's - What ? Suicidal ? I think we should organize a search . We 've done a resonant scan of the entire area . No sign of anything . Not even his A.T.V. Keep scanning . What if he was taken by the Terrians , like Uly ? He wasn 't taken by anyone . He left on his own . We 're going to have to start an on-foot search . It 's nighttime . Nothing we can do till sunup . Let 's just get our rest , and we 'll go out looking in the morning . [ Woman ] Beautiful , isn 't she ? You used to look at me that way . Who are you ? Has it been that long , Alonzo ? Lydia ? What are you doing here ? Visiting you . Remember the Garsonia star base ? We had such fun together those weeks . You feel good , Lydia . You do . Do you want to cry , Alonzo ? I don 't know . I wish I could . But that 's not you . [ Chuckles ] You don 't cry . You 're a pilot . You just fly away . I don 't fly anymore , Lydia . I 'm all alone on this stupid planet in the middle of nowhere , and I think I 'm going crazy . What am I gonna do ? You 'll live , just like the rest of us . - Where did she go ? - She became me . She got married . She had children . She - She had a life , and she grew old . I 'm not made for that part of life . - Which part , love ? - The growing old part . [ Clicks Tongue ] Oh , that 's all there is . The seconds , the minutes , the hours , the years . Believe me , it is a beautiful ride , better than - better than any flight you 've ever taken . Wait , wait . Lydia , wait . Wait . It 's time for you to go home . Can I just kiss you good-bye ? Morgan ? [ Panting ] Morgan , honey . What 's wrong ? I 'm - I 'm not doing so well . Well , what is it ? Oh . Honey , are you worried about Alonzo ? We 're gonna find him . I 'm not worried about Alonzo . I 'm worried about me . I can 't do this , Bess . It 's been 1 0 hours now without a single hit of virtual . There 's only so much reality a man can take . Shh . Calm down . Calm down . Try to think about something else . Like what ? [ Panting ] [ Clears Throat ] That bracelet I gave you ... that you traded away for something that doesn 't even work ? Morgan , I didn 't wanna trade it . [ Sighs ] You know , I 'm really gettin ' the shaft here , Bess . Didn 't we take a vow to forsake all others ? Don 't you think that you should be looking out for me ? You 're right , Morgan . And I 'm gonna make it up to you . Bess , where are you going ? I 'm going to visit that Grendler . Now ? In-In the middle of the night ? Are you sure that 's safe ? I 'm gonna get your V.R. gear back . My V.R. ? Really ? You would do that for me ? Mm-hmm . Morgan , this whole trading thing has brought nothing good to the group , except maybe a few measly pieces of fruit . And now my husband 's in pain . I think I need to set things straight . Set things straight with you . [ Grunting ] Hello . It 's me . I - I came to make another trade . Remember ? Give and take . Uh-uh . Now , don 't get too hasty . I - I brought you something real special . Something more your size . I mean , that V.R. gear doesn 't really go with your eyes . What I brought is gonna look real good around your neck . Hold on . Hold on . [ Clears Throat , Chuckles ] You like it , don 't you ? Well , that thing might be more valuable than I thought . Morgan ? Bess . [ Giggles ] You got it . [ Giggles ] You 're a genius . He thinks he robbed me blind . He didn 't know who he was dealing with . You - Mmm . What 's that ? Morgan , this is the most fabulous device in the world . It 's a geolock box . My father used it in the mines down on Earth . Morgan , it locks up land so nothing can come through - no shovels , no pickaxes , no Terrians . Really ? Locks up land , huh ? So this must be pretty complicated to operate . Well , not if we can crack the access code . So , this geo-thingy , it might be used to , say , mmm , lock up a precious mineral find for safekeeping ? Yes , that 's exactly what I 've been trying to tell Devon , but she won 't listen to me . But I think she 'll listen to me now , now that I have something that 's gonna help the group . Let 's go . The group . [ Groans ] Oh , man . [ Mumbling ] Where the hell am I ? [ Grunting ] You 're up early . I 'm up early ? Alonzo , you 've had the whole camp in a state . Where have you been ? [ Softly ] I know . What happened to the A.T.V. ? What happened to your forehead ? I don 't know what happened . I - I went for a ride . I wiped out or something . Julia , um - I 'm sorry . You 're sorry . What for ? I don 't know . Everything . I had a dream . And were the Terrians in it ? They were . Look , I don 't know , maybe - Maybe I 'm going crazy or something , but , uh - but I feel like I 'm healed . I 'm healed . Well , I hate to tell you , but , uh , your leg looks just as broken as it was yesterday . [ Chuckles ] I know . I better put a bandage on it . [ Softly ] Okay . [ Inhales ] [ Sighs ] I 'm sorry too . [ Morgan ] I did it . I cracked the access code . Now all we need is an abort code . Morgan , how did you get that so fast ? That 's all I ever did at work , was crack these codes . If you waited for information to come down through the proper channels , you would never know anything . Now how is this mechanism gonna work ? Well , I - I remember watching my father . Let 's see . Well , the canister fits into the injector like so . Then you prime it , and you initiate the sequence with the code . You know , Bess , I think that your father ... would have wanted you to use this geolock ... to ... stake a claim , have a mine of your own . - Morgan , we have to share this with everyone . - Uh , sure . - Why is that again ? - Because we 're part of the Eden Project now . Yeah , but you found the geolock . I mean , we start sharing this with people , you know who 's gonna get the credit , don 't you ? Devon Adair . Just like always . And after the way she 's been treating you , Bess ? Morgan , she 's - She 's got a lot on her mind . Bess , I 've heard the way she talks to you , ordering you around like - like your dad 's bosses ordered him around . Okay , let 's not argue about this now . Let 's just scrub the abort code and see if the darn thing works . All right . Let 's give it a try . Right here ? Yeah . I 'll set the zone size to minimum . Say , half a meter ? Uh , sure . Ready ? Okay . [ Beeping ] [ Computer Voice ] Reaction will commence in 1 0 seconds . Move away from the zone . Move away from the zone . [ Devon ] Bess ? Bess ? Morgan , turn it off . I can 't turn it off . There 's no abort code . Hide it . Cover it up . Five , four , three , two - [ Rumbling ] What was that sound ? Uh - - Uh , Terrians . - Devon , what can we do for you ? I , uh - I made a list of things to go after on our next trade . I know you mentioned a geolock , but that is way down on our list . First , we need fruit , and I think I saw solar panels and heavy clothing . Bess , what 's going on ? Do I work for you , Devon ? No . No , you don 't , Bess . Then why do you treat me like I do ? I didn 't know that I did . You do , and I don 't appreciate it . Now then , Morgan and I were right in the middle of something , so I will come find you when I 'm ready to trade again . Fine . Fine , I 'll be in my tent . [ Hissing ] Holy cow . It really works . How big of a chunk will this thing freeze ? Maximum diameter is a little over a kilometer . Well , um - Should I go and get everybody ? I think they 're going to want to see what we 've got . We 're keeping this for ourselves , Morgan . It 's apparently every woman for herself here . I couldn 't agree more , sweetie . I could not agree more . [ Sighs ] Morgan , it 's so hard what this planet does to you . [ Yale Narrating ] Where we came from , we changed the world to suit our needs . On this planet , we will be the ones to change , for good or for bad . Bess grew a little , but let go a piece ofherself , maybe an innocence she once cherished . While others , like Alonzo , rediscovered pieces they thought they had lost forever . It 's okay , pal . I 'm not going anywhere .

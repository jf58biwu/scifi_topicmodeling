 - Previously on The Pretender . - Who am I ? Was I bought ? Stolen ? Where are my mom and dad ? - This is my mother . - [ Sydney ] Yes , it is . His name is Angelo . Someone who can absorb the intellectual , emotional , even the physical traits of others ... and literally becomes that person . - I want to know what happened to my mother . - I killed her . That 's what I torture myself believing . Raines is a dangerous man . He may be involved with the murder of Miss Parker 's mother . - I fantasize about killing him . - The only people who know about SL 27 ... are either dead or comatose . SL 27 . Sublevel 27 . - What the hell is that ? - Birthing table . With shackles ? [ Gate Buzzes ] [ Chatter , Indistinct ] [ Man ] You got my radio or what ? You know the drill . - Better tighten them shackles . - Houdini couldn 't get out of these . - Tighten ' em . - Why ? This convict 's not playing with a full deck ? Deck and a half , brother . All wild cards . Bit a guard 's nose off once . Said he didn 't like the way ... - the guard used it to look down on him . - [ Scoffs ] A little reeducation will change his diet . Signed , sealed and soon to be delivered . - [ Coughing ] - Hey , hey . Like I said . Wild cards . [ Grunting ] That 's a taste of your future . Come on . Now , remember , always irrigate your gums . - I aqua-flush every night . - Good . What about your brother ? He doesn 't even floss . Ike , can I have my sucker , please ? Thank you . We try with him , Dr. Jarod , but I guess Ike will always be a Goofus . - A Goofus ? - And Gallant . It 's all in here . " Goofus leaves his room a mess . Gallant makes his bed every day . " A morality lesson in a children 's comic book . Fascinating . - [ Burps ] - I 'll have to read these . [ Woman On TV ] The convicts took control of the transport van . Moments ago , I spoke with the prison guards lucky to have survived . All of a sudden , he was in the cab . Thought he was gonna kill us right there . - Cool . - He kept smiling at us ... like he was having fun messing with our minds . He locked us in the back of the van , drove into the pond . Only an inch of air to breathe . I thought I was gonna die . The F.B.I. Task Force , led by Special Agent Korkos ... is on the trail of this criminal , known only as John Doe . The escapee is 6 ' 1 " , 175 pounds ... and has a distinctive burn mark on his right hand . We 'll have more on this breaking story as information becomes available . - Cool . - He 's incorrigible , Dr. Jarod . Dr. Jarod ? - You have to talk . - No . Why ? The anticipation of pain is clearly more effective than the pain itself . - He 's almost at the brink . - [ Young Raines ] Don 't argue with me , just do it . - But ... - Just do it . - Ow ! You burnt my hand ! - It was real , Sydney . - You bastard ! - Sweepers . Get to the infirmary now . Kyle , I 'm sorry ! I would never hurt you . Kyle , I would never hurt you . I would never hurt you . Kyle . Never hurt you . [ Man Narrating ] In all the time that he 's been here , did you interact with him ? Oh , yeah , we interacted , but it wasn 't always him . He always thought he was somebody different every time you see him . Could talk with a doctor , astronaut , anything . Yeah , so what do you criminal psychologists call that anyway ? - Multiple personalities ? - Something like that . Weird too , man . I mean , this guy spends 10 years in stir ... and nobody could figure out who he was , where he come from . - Is that why you called him " John Doe " ? - Yeah . I actually believe this guy didn 't know who he was either . He used to tell me there was voices speaking to him in his head all the time . In this guy 's case , them voices were really there . And when those voices told him he was somebody different , he made you believe it too . Really ? I remember one time I played along with him . He told me he was an I.R.S. investigator . So I let him do my taxes . The guy got me a $ 4,000 refund . Hey . I always wondered where he kept that thing . He used to sit there , scribbling in that thing like a madman every time his doctor left . - What 's it say ? - That he 's dangerous . What was his doctor 's name ? I called him " Dr. Wheezy . " Not polite I know , but hey , the guy , he breathed funny . I guess anybody would , dragging around his own oxygen tank though , huh ? [ Buzzing ] [ Sydney ] We 're giving Angelo every red notebookJarod ever made . [ Miss Parker ] Now tell me again : Exactly what 's Buzz Boy going to do with them ? [ Broots ] The theory is that since Angelo can absorb all the personality data given to him ... maybe , just maybe , he might be able to determine whereJarod is ... emotionally and physically . Well , then , let 's see what the potato head can do . Okay . Put it down , Angelo . Put him back in his space . I have authorization to use him . No one below me can authorize his use . My father isn 't below you . This better work . Well , I know if it doesn 't , my butt 's on the line . Mmm , wrong piece of anatomy . [ Phone Rings ] Hello . This is Harriet . Somebody open a window . It stinks in here . Do we have point of origin on that phone call yet ? A friend called to warn Harriet Tashman about the escaped John Doe . They traced the call at local headquarters when I got there . Special AgentJarod Ness . I was sent by Washington . - Ness ? - No relation . [ Chuckles ] Well , welcome aboard . We need all the help we can get on this one . The escapee is a John Doe . In the 10 years since his arrest , we couldn 't find anything about him . No priors . No fingerprint matches , D.N.A. , nothing . Like he fell from the sky . He was convicted of a string of violent felonies ... on a cross-country binge that ended in the kidnapping of one Harriet Tashman ... whose spilled soup you happen to be standing in . All of those victims shared one common denominator . They were all terrified . This sick puppy relishes psychological torture . Doe stalked Miss Tashman for two days before he grabbed her at gunpoint ... and forced her to drive him away . Miss Tashman had the presence of mind to crash the car into an embankment ... injuring herself and John Doe , but thereby escaping whatever fate he had in store for her . - That was 10 years ago . - And you think he 's after her again ? It 's speculation on my part , but all of those actions ... prior to her kidnap were random . He came here for her , and , clearly , he was taking her somewhere . Are we sure he was after her ? He was before , and by the look of how quickly she left ... - he must be again . - Aren 't you guys done yet ? - Who are you ? - Jenkins . I 'm the manager of this place . Ness , take Mr. Jenkins 's statement . Oh , come on . I gave a statement to the first guy . - The first guy ? - The F.B.I. agent who was here this morning . [ Dog Barking In Distance ] - Yeah , yeah . Where to ? - Perfect day like this , I 'll tell you when to stop . Hey , hey , hey , hey . No smoking . You mean me ? No . I mean the invisible guy next to you . Yeah , you . Put it out . - But I just lit it . - I don 't care if you invented it . Put it out . Whatever you say . [ Sydney ] Calm down , Miss Parker . You 've got to have patience . Patience ? Don 't talk to me about patience . What I need is a cattle prod . Maybe that 'll jump-start the little lab rat . He hasn 't blinked , smiled , moved , nothing . Angelo is absorbing his way through the notebooks chronologically . Right now , he 's in the mid - ' 70s . I believe I saw him squint around 1969 . [ Broots ] After looking at the notebook on Marilyn Monroe , I think he giggled . I should never have put myself on the line for you two . This is a waste of time , Syd . [ Angelo Growling ] [ Miss Parker Choking ] - Angelo , no . - Sam , help ! Let go of her , Angelo . Angelo , let go . Sweepers , help . ! Angelo , let go . ! - Miss Parker , you okay ? - [ Panting ] - You okay ? - What the hell was that ? A violent reaction to whatever was in the red notebook . It 's not red . The notebook he was absorbing , it 's blue . [ Phones Ringing ] [ Woman ] Residents were stunned by the attack on Harriet Tashman , a former nun . Tashman 's injuries were minor ... and sources report that she does not want to press charges . At the moment , a spokesperson for the police is telling us ... that they are considering this case closed . Oh , my God . [ Drawer Opens , Closes ] Mom . He scared me . I 'm glad he didn 't hurt you . Angelo has always been a mystery . Something on your mind ? Mr. Raines was upset that I gave you access to Angelo . Boohoo for Dracula . Angelo is his project . Apparently , Raines has been worried about him becoming violent . - The guy is a marshmallow . - Still , he attacked you . - That justifies Raines 's fear and concern for you . - Concern ? Daddy , you may not want to hear this , but I think he 's working behind your back . He would not defy me . I 'm sorry . Daddy , I know that that tone is inappropriate . No , no , no . You may be right . I 've never doubted Raines 's dedication , but he 's been different . Ever sinceJarod 's been out , I 've wondered if there was something . Trust me , Daddy . There is . Do you have anything tangible ? No . If you should find something real , something I could trust ... I 'll bring it to your attention immediately . My grandpa was the caretaker here before me . Miss Harriet , she 's the woman who owns this place ... gave me the job after Grandpa died . She sends me money in the mail to keep it looking pretty for her . Funny , huh ? - Funny ? - Well , that she wants it kept looking so pretty . She ain 't been here in 10 years or more . Do you know where she is ? How to reach her ? No . I haven 't talked with her or anything . Sometimes ... Sometimes I wonder if it 's really her that sends the money . Have you ever seen this woman before ? - I have to go . - Joe Bill , please . This is my mother . I don 't know where she is . Never knew my mama . All there ever was was me and Grandpa . He says we 're not supposed to talk about them . That they don 't live here . - They lived here ? - Over the barn . Almost never came out . Always alone . She had red hair ... and he made planes out of wood . Always planes . When I was little , Miss Harriet , she taught me how to read good ... gooder . These people always seemed like ... that book about the little girl who lived in the attic . Her name was Anne . Anne Frank ? - The family that was hiding from the Nazis . - Hiding . Hiding . They left right after Miss Harriet got took . Maybe it 's them that sends the money , huh ? Joe Bill , do you know where they went ? Just went . They left some stuff . [ Cell Phone Rings ] - Yes . - This is Agent Meadow . We got a lead on Doe . Korkos wants everyone here now . Ness . Ness ? - I 'm on my way . - [ Phone Beeps Off ] - I 'll be back . - Cabbie 's in County General psych ward . No injuries , but massive shock . - Doc says he was literally scared nearly to death . - What happened ? He was tied into his seat . Mouth taped shut . Eyes taped open . - Like he wanted him to watch something . - His fate . Doe parked his cab on top of some railroad tracks facing a tunnel . Did the cabbie give us any leads ? It 's hard to talk after some psycho 's put his cigarette out on your tongue . But he did say something about Doe repeating , " I decide who lives or dies . " All the more reason for us to find him before he finds Harriet Tashman ... if he hasn 't already . This blue notebook belonged to another subject . His name 's Kyle , and he was part of the Pretender program here years ago ... under the direction of then Dr. Raines . I guess it only makes sense that you 'd have more than one freak in your farm system . What makes Kyle so special ? The fact that he was officially released from the center ... before the date on the blue notebook . Are you saying that Raines kept Kyle for his own project ? Where ? SL 27 . I rerouted the security system ... so if anyone has this place monitored , it should be all right for about 30 minutes . Look , since we don 't have much time ... why don 't you keep your mouth shut and your eyes open . Fine with me . I don 't wanna be down here in the first place . [ Sydney ] Over here . My God . Somebody was forced to live here . And from the look of these striations ... he spent a great deal of time trying to claw his way out of here . Sydney . Miss Parker . - [ Sydney ] Broots , where are you ? - Down here . Down the hall . - What is it ? - It 's a Brainchild . One of the first generation of super computers . Raines 's Brainchild . This is what he used to record his work down here . I had a computer like this in my early years with Jarod . And this was what we stored his sims on ... before transferring them to D.S.A. Pretty useless now . Unless ... those analogs were backed up . - In there ? How ? - Some of these systems had primitive hard-drive memories . - [ Laughs ] Computer club in college . - [ Forced Chuckle ] Do whatever it is you have to do . If it 's in there , I want it out . - Call me when you have it . - Whoa , whoa . Whoa . - You want me to stay down here ? Alone ? - You still have 20 minutes . Come on , Sydney . Hi , Kyle . It 's me , Jarod . Remember ? - [ Kyle ] We 're not supposed to talk . - Where are you from ? - I don 't know . - Me neither . I only remember here . Do you know who you are ? - [ Rewinds ] - Do you know who you are ? Who you are ? Who you are ? - [ Miss Parker ] What did you find ? - Ten million bits of information . A lot of it 's about Kyle . My machines are sorting it out now ... but I did manage to transfer one sim onto a D.S.A. format . - What 's on it ? - It 's hot . I 'm tired . I 've been in Memphis for three days . Can 't sleep . There 's too many people outside this motel . I 'm getting ready . I 'm gonna make history . I 'm gonna close a bleeding wound . You don 't think Dr. King is a good man . No . He 's dividing our country . We had laws , and we had order . King doesn 't obey , and Americans , they 're afraid . [ Young Raines ] Maybe it 's you who 's afraid . No . He 's the menace . Kennedy gave in to him , and Hoover can 't stop him . It ends now . He has to die . [ Young Raines ] Now who are you to make thatjudgment ? I decide who lives or dies . I decide who lives or dies . - My God ! He did it . - Did what ? Raines . He always wanted to do this experiment with one of the Pretenders . He thought that if he could feed him enough negative reinforcement ... he could strip them of their morality . And he could , uh , create a sociopath . I decide who lives or dies . I decide who lives or dies . You 're all set there . Welcome to the Bay State . - [ Alarm Beeping ] - [ Young Sydney ] Your ship was spying in our waters . We demand you sign the admission of aggression . - We 'd rather die . - What about you , Lieutenant ? Well ... - maybeJarod 's right . - [ Young Raines ] Damn it ! That 's it . - [ Young Sydney ] What are you doing ? - I never should 've allowed it . - We 're aborting . - Dr. Raines . Dr. Raines . A Flying Cross . Did they give this to you ? No . I 've just always had it . - Dr. Raines let you keep it ? - Dr. Raines is my friend . It 's origami . I 'll teach you how to make it sometime . - Where do they keep you ? - They take me down an elevator . I 'm not sure where , but there 's sounds in the ceiling . From the air vents . I hear those sounds too . We must be close to each other . The speaker they use to talk to us , is there a wire leading from it ? Yeah . Why ? I think I know how we can talk ... without them hearing us . [ Elevator Dings ] [ Elevator Stops ] What did you do with Kyle ? Don 't commit political suicide over ancient history . You ignored a Tower directive when you kept Kyle here after his release date . [ Elevator Starts ] If I were you , I 'd stop dwelling on the past . Jarod is your only lifeline in this place ... and the longer he 's out there ... the weaker your influence on him becomes . [ Elevator Dings ] On my grave , Raines , if Kyle is alive , I 'll find him . That son of a bitch could be anywhere . All right . Here 's a profile our " psychological geniuses " have put out on John Doe . In a nutshell , it says he 's a time bomb waiting to detonate . Welcome to the party . From here on out I 'm ordering a PAC on up to a 2-1-11 . A shoot to kill order ? Sir , I admitJohn Doe is unpredictable , but he 's never killed anybody . Spoken like a true Clinton-era recruit . We 're talking about a head case who put a cigarette out on a man 's tongue . That sound like somebody you wanna try and reason with ? About another half hour I 'll have the next SL 27 sim ready to ... Sydney ? Miss Parker ? [ Man ] Hey , kids , it 's time for Uncle Buddy 's cartoon extravaganza . - God I love this show . - Fasten your funny bones and we 'll be right back . [ Reporter ] Now a news update from the Channel 3 news center ... and our anchorperson Wendy Barrett . [ Barrett ] While the F.B.I. continues its dogged investigation ... of the recent prison escapee known only as John Doe ... agency authorities admit that they are rapidly running out ofleads ... in their attempt to locate and apprehend ... Angelo ! What are you doing out here ? Agent Korkos is appealing to the public for any information that may lead to Doe 's arrest ... and a reward is being offered . - As you may recall , Doe is ... - Wait a minute . [ Clicks Tongue ] Wait , wait . I didn 't know ... I didn 't mean anything . Wait a minute . No , no . Wait . Wait . - I didn 't ... I didn 't mean ... - [ Reporter Continues ] SL 27 ? SL 27 ? - And Jell-O Brains told you this ? - Not with words ... but there 's no doubt what he was saying . John Doe is Kyle . [ Joe Bill ] They lived up there . Not so clean . I haven 't never been up here . Not allowed . So everything 's just the way it was when they left ? Think so . Man made one for me one Christmas . I liked it . [ Baby Crying ] - There was a baby here . - Used to hear it cry . Never saw it . Wasn 't allowed up here . - What is it ? - My compost pile . Eyes watching me from up here . Little eyes . Staring . Scared me . Never saw the baby , but the baby saw me . " And under the hand of God ... Ye little children shall never be lost . " I told you ... you 're gonna have to wait . But , Daddy , please . I can 't hold it anymore . I don 't care if you wet your damn pants . Now shut the hell up ! Hey ! You shouldn 't treat children like that . [ Groaning ] You 're breaking it . [ Groaning ] [ Kyle ] Harriet . You should love your children . Always . Hey , there , big fella . [ Grunts ] The bathroom is right over there . - Hey , where you going ? Hey , what 's going on here ? - [ Starts Engine ] What kind of place is this ? That 's my car . You 're not gonna believe what 's on this disk , Sydney . - Show me . Show me . - I 'm glad you 're alone . - Why ? - [ Clears Throat ] Miss Parker . Well , I 'm not Scooby-Doo . What 's the problem , Broots ? Miss Parker , I know you don 't respect me ... but I just don 't think you should watch this disk . [ Scoffs ] Play the damn disk . Hate dictates reality . The sooner you embrace it and focus it upon your enemy ... the sooner total control will be realized . It 's more than just a word . Hate is a feeling . I have it in here . Very good , Kyle . Feel it grow . Let it grow . Tomorrow I 'll take you to theJersey Shore , to the Dragon House . You like the Dragon House , don 't you ? - I feel safe there . - And you always will . He was teaching him to hate my mother . To shoot my mother . I 'm sorry , Miss Parker . This explains Angelo 's sudden attack on you . He was just simulating Kyle 's intense feelings of hatred for your mother . I have to tell my father about this . - [ Snaps Fingers ] - If he doesn 't already know . This is the Centre . We 're talking about my mother 's death . All I am saying is we must be cautious . All three of us . Everything we have learned can be traced back to SL 27 . If anyone figures that out , well . Only your heart , Parker , can measure the degree to which you should trust your father . Just be careful . [ Clears Throat ] I 'm sorry you had to see this . Broots , I do respect you . - I 'm very pleased with that . - Oh , thank you . - [ Continues , Indistinct ] - [ Bells Tolling ] - Hi . - [ Boy ] Wait up for me . Let 's go girls . We don 't want to be late for class . Everybody stay in line . [ Gasps ] Help ! Help ! Harriet ! " I decide who lives or dies . " It 's a rough report . You said that if I learned anything , I should bring it to you ? Mmm . I 'm figuring Kyle was kept here at least 10 years after the scheduled release . Where did these experiments take place ? I 'm not sure . Exactly how did you learn about Raines ? I 'm S.I.S. , Daddy . You taught me well . You have proof to back this up ? I 'd hoped that it would be enough I were your daughter . Of course . But I have people to answer to . I need tangibles . I have a source . Can we just leave it at that ? I should 've known . Another garden path obscured byJarod 's weeds . Jarod had absolutely nothing to do with me learning about this . This report says that , um , Raines taught Kyle things . - What-What things ? - To hate . To kill . Kill ? Who ? I 'm not sure ... yet . Did you know what Raines was doing ? Would I have allowed him to continue if I did ? There was a time when I knew everything that went on here . Maybe my time has passed . I 'm sorry , Daddy . Let me run with this . Please . And I will bring you back the best tangible evidence that there is . - What ? - Kyle . Can you hear me ? Where are you ? Three doors down from the corridor . Where are you ? Four . I 'm right next to you . [ Clattering ] - Did you hear that ? - Yes . Maybe they know . Do you think they know we 're talking ? [ Young Jarod ] Someone does . - This is Sydney . - Tell me about the Dragon House . Was it some kind of ad hoc torture chamber ? A Centre asylum ? A safe house ? - This is about Kyle , isn 't it ? - Kyle is out there . Was he sent to kill my parents ? My God , Jarod ! I don 't know . I swear it . [ Exhales ] I 'll find answers . Quickly , Sydney . Please . - Sydney . - Broots , I need you to do something for me . - Sure , what ? - Hack into Mr. Raines 's computer . Hey , Peter . This is Dr. Jarod . How are your gums ? - They 're pink . - Listen , I was wondering ... I 'd be happy to do you a favor . New England Air ? I 'd like to book a round-trip shuttle to Boston , please . All right . Gather around , people . We finally got something . A phone tip . Witness saw John Doe try to pry open an A.T.M. machine in Boston . - A tip from whom ? - Some kid named Goofinski . - We got the surveillance right here . - How do you know it 's him ? Look . Look at that scar , Ness . That 's him . All right . Foster , Caine , Charles . We 're going to Boston . - I 'm checking this out personally . - What about me ? I want in . Last thing I need is an agent with a cold trigger finger ... - when I tell this crackpot to put his cigarette out . - Oh , come on . End of discussion . You 're an 18-11 on this one , Ness . Oh , great . Desk duty . The Dragon House is located in a place called Delphi Shores , New Jersey . - Thank you , Sydney . - Chances are Raines will be ... zeroing in on the Dragon House too . As you know , I have no choice but to give Miss Parker the same information . Go there and you won 't be alone . Loneliness is something I left at the Centre . One last thing , Jarod . If you find Kyle ... you have to know he 's not the person you once knew . Neither am I. [ Harriet ] No . - Tell me where they are . - I can 't . I heard once that the anticipation of pain ... is far more effective than pain itself . Now ... - we 're gonna find out . - [ Thud ] My name is Jarod . I 'm here to help you . You 're late . She 's with me . I love a class reunion . Mr. Raines . I knew I never should 've let you two get together . Boys , let 's go . I 'm not going anywhere with you . - Neither am I. - [ Gasps ] Get ' em ! Kyle , you know me . I 'm Jarod . They said Jarod was dead . Now I decide who lives or dies . Not this time . I hit the Lotto ! [ Harriet ] Jarod , no . ! [ Miss Parker ] Jarod ! - [ Sydney ] Which one ? Which one ? - Get Kyle ! Get in . [ Engine Starts ] You could 've gotten us both killed . Why did you stop me from shooting him ? I stopped you because Kyle is your brother . I don 't remember my parents or anything about having a brother . Well , you were very young when you were taken . We often repress , forget . How did they come to be with you ? Well , my own parents were killed three weeks before my 11 th birthday . I grew up in a convent , content to give my life serving the church as a nun . I had said my vows and was cloistered for years . - But it didn 't take . - Was my family tied to the convent ? No , no . There was another girl . CatherineJamison . We were real rabble-rousers . Gave the Mother Superior hell . One night we snuck out and were crossing this frozen pond . I slipped in . I was drowning . Catherine dove in , dragged me out and then breathed life back into me . She never became a nun , but the spirit that glowed in her ... was something I 've been unable to achieve despite years of prayer . Then after she left the convent , she married a man by the name of ... - Parker . - Yes . Catherine Parker . - Did you know her ? - Her daughter . What did she have to do with my parents ? Well , in 1969 , the year I inherited this farm ... Mother Superior called and said Catherine needed help . Catherine showed up and asked me to shelter a man and a woman ... who had had their two young sons abducted . Is that when my parents came here ? I knew them as Charles and Margaret . They were afraid . They 'd been searching for years ... and they were on the run . It was safe here . Did they ever talk or ask about me or my brother ? They never talked . I never asked . It was too painful . Especially for your father . It was clear how deeply he missed his sons . Did they ever say who they thought might 've taken us ? I think your father was afraid it would affect your mother 's health . [ Crying ] - The baby . - She gave birth to a little girl a month later . - I have a sister . - Her name is Emily . - Emily . - [ Harriet Chuckles ] There are no pictures . I 'm sorry . Years later , I started getting threatening phone calls and letters from Kyle . He must 've figured out I had some tie to your parents . He was desperate . He thought I could help him . It was after the kidnapping that your family vanished . You 've been hiding here ever since . I 'd lost contact with Catherine Parker years earlier . I felt alone , and I was afraid . So I went underground . Your parents loved you , Jarod . They loved and they missed you and your brother . Do you remember where you first lived when you came to the Centre ? At first , three doors down from the corridor entrance . - Later , sublevel ... - What was the Manchester Solution ? The Manchester Solution . l-I don 't remember any solution because the job was blown . - I could 've done it alone . I simmed it correct ... - [ Whirring ] The others lost the will , but I didn 't . I decide who lives or dies . I decide who lives or dies . [ Whirring ] You said after all those years in prison , he 'd remember nothing . - He can 't remember everything . - He remembers too much . Jarod alone is bad enough . I brought him in . Why is he here ? - I asked him to be . - Who in the hell is Kyle anyway ? Or should I say what ? Kyle is someone of concern to me . You missed Jarod . It was your best chance , and he 's still out there . I know you 're upset . I should 've told you that I had brought Mr. Raines in on this . I apologize . But things were moving quickly . Now Mr. Raines and I will handle Kyle . - But , Daddy ... - No , no , no . Trust me . Sydney , do you think Jarod might return to the Centre ? There 's nothing here thatJarod wants . And Jarod always has an objective . Besides , even though we never figured out how he got out ... our latest security improvements are quite beyond anyone 's capabilities . Even Jarod 's . That 's the first time I have ever heard you doubtJarod 's abilities . Let 's just hope they believed it as much as you did . - Get him out of here . - No ! Jarod , help ! No , leave me alone . Jarod ! Jarod ! Jarod , help me . ! [ Dog Barking In Distance ] You said it was a matter of great importance . [ Quietly ] I want you to help me get to Kyle . - Why ? - Because he knows something about my mother 's death . What do you want me to do ? Beg ? [ Birds Fluttering ] What makes you so certain that Kyle can help you ? Because he was Mr. Raines 's pet project . I feel it . Sydney , I feel it . Kyle knows who killed my mother . Look , they 're keeping him in a section I don 't have access to . Also , they 're monitoring him round the clock from the tech room . There 's just no way for anyone to get there undetected . - Right ? - Mmm , well , that 's not entirely true . What do you mean ? I mean , I got us into SL 27 , didn 't I ? I could probably bypass the sensors ... and at a designated time , loop the camera feed into the monitor system . Well , for how long ? Mmm , long enough . [ Chattering ] I was looking for ... here . [ Beeps ] [ Groans ] Oh , that 's hot ! That ... [ Grunts ] I 'm sorry . It 's okay . Got it . You look just like her . That 's what they tell me . You 're the one who decides who lives or dies , right ? - You know my work . - Did you kill my mother ? Did you kill my mother ? - No . - Then who ? Was it Mr. Raines ? [ Elevator Buzzes ] What are you doing here ? I was trying to find my way to the , uh , new accounting offices . Why do I think you 're lying ? Open the door . [ Wheels Squeaking ] [ Metal Rattles ] Get him out of here . [ Jarod ] My parents must have loved this place . I may know someone ... who can help you find what you 're looking for . Who ? [ Chuckles ] Solemn vows die hard . I 'll have to go and see them . Alone . It 's too dangerous . Catherine didn 't think of herself when she pulled me out of that icy pond . [ Sighs ] I 'll be ... I 'll be gone a few days . I won 't be here . I 've spent every moment since I broke out ... searching and hunting for some clue that might lead me to my past . And right now , the biggest clue to it is back where I started . I don 't understand . I 'm going to get my brother . I 'm going back to the Centre . Hello , Sydney . My God . How 'd you get in ? The same way I got out . Why didn 't you tell me about my family ? About my brother ? - Your brother ? - Kyle . At least that 's what I think his name is . - Why didn 't you tell me ? - I didn 't know . All I know about Kyle is ... actually , whatJacob told me . [ Wheels Squeaking ] Am I interrupting something ? Oh . Just going over some notes . Of course . Always the conscientious one . You will notify me ifJarod attempts to make contact with you . What if he contacts you first ? [ Whispers ] Jarod . Jarod . Jarod , help me ! [ Clinking ] Angelo . Angelo . [ Laughs ] - Look at your hair . - [ Soft Thud ] CrackerJack . C.J. You 're C.J. You wrote those letters to Kyle in prison . You 've been in contact with him just like you 've been in contact with me . It 's been a long time since we 've had to perform ... this kind of a radical procedure , Dr. Raines . And the Tower hasn 't made their approval clear yet . I 've made the diagnosis . A frontal lobe separation is the only way to bring him peace . Unless you 'd like to offer a differing opinion . - [ Rattles ] - I 'll call for anesthesia . He 'll be ready in 10 minutes . Raines . Raines ! Who the hell are you ? I 'm Jarod . Raines said you were dead . Not hardly . Why are you helping me ? Because ... I 'm your brother . - I don 't have any family . - Yes . You do . I 'm guessing ... our father gave you this . My God . - You kept it . - Not me . He did . Come on . It 's time we all were free . [ Yelling ] - [ Kyle Yelling ] - No . ! No . ! No . ! Nobody gets hurt . Where are we going ? Home . Angelo , come on . Get in . No . I decide who lives or dies . - [ Alarm Blaring ] - Angelo . Angelo , no ! [ Alarm Blaring ] How did this happen ? Alarm sensors indicate they 're in SL 19 . I 'm on it . I need to speak to Mr. Parker . - This way . - Where does it lead ? Out . Come on . We 're on 19 . Broots , where are they ? I 'm working on it . I 'm working on it . - Go down to 20 . - [ Grumbles ] Miss Parker , I 'm getting a signal in the motion detectors . They 're in the ventilation system . Right where you are . Rip that down . Damn it . It 's Cousin Itt . It 's Angelo . [ Grunts ] Come on . Trust me . Tell me this wasn 't you , Daddy . I know better . I did not authorize this procedure . I would never do that . Raines was prepared to destroy a Centre investment ... with no directive from the Tower ... to protect himself from what Kyle knows . We 've both been feeling it for a long time . Raines has had his own agenda long enough . He 'll be dealt with . Just bring me back what belongs to the Centre . [ Yells ] - It 's okay . - [ Yells ] It 's okay . It 's okay . Here . It 's one of the small joys of freedom . There 's candy underneath the head . Ah ... That 's okay . I have plenty more . We just gonna drive ? I know a place where we can rest . How long you been out ? Almost a year now . There 's so much out here . You have so much catching up to do . You do remember . That Kyle was a million years ago , Jarod . By the time I broke from the Centre , my head was mush . All I thought about was finding my ... finding our parents . And anybody got in my way , I just ran over ' em . Before long , I was running from the law . By the time I figured things out and got to Harriet ... I just ... I never wanted to hurt her . I just thought she knew where they were . [ Jarod ] Something good came out of it . At least we have a place to start . [ Broots ] Well , that 's the rest of it . He 's gone through everything we have . Jarod 's notebooks , F.B.I. files , everything we 've got on Kyle . He 's almost done . [ Sydney ] Real glutton for punishment , hmm ? Desperate times , desperate measures , Sydney . If Sponge Boy here really can become anyone , like all the quacks around here claim ... then I 'm letting him become Kyle and Jarod at the same time . - Maybe he 'll tell me where they went . - [ Yells ] Maybe we should have tethered him . Aren 't we making one erroneous assumption , Dr. Parker ? What 's he gonna blow ? A transistor ? - You assume that he wants to help you . - Why wouldn 't he ? Just let this quack handle it , hmm ? Jarod . Jarod . If you 're really in there , Jarod ... then you 'll know who I am ... and that I can help you . Also , that I am the only one ... who can protect you from Mr. Raines . [ Grunting ] Easy . Easy . I 'm going home . I 'm safe here . Kyle kidnapped a woman named Harriet Tashman . He was trying to get her to this place . [ Wheels Squeaking ] - I can feel them here . - I know . But they don 't have faces . 'Cause we don 't remember . Or the Centre didn 't let us remember . Maybe this will help . She 's beautiful . They 're still out there , aren 't they ? Yes . Them ... and our sister . She was born after we were gone . Dad taught me . We 're going to find them . We wouldn 't have gotten this far unless we were meant to . [ Phone Rings ] Korkos . Do you want to know whereJohn Doe is ? [ Metal Clangs ] Harriet . We didn 't know it was you . It 's all right . We all want the same thing . - I have some good news . - [ Vehicle Approaching ] Somebody 's coming up the road . Let 's get out of here . Get ' em . [ Jarod ] Hold on ! [ Yells ] - [ Groans ] - Kyle . - Kyle ! - Hold still . Let me look . No . Go . My leg is broken . No . I 'm not going to leave you here . Jarod , go ! Find our parents . Don 't tell them what I became . Come on , Jarod . Come on , Jarod . Come on . Freeze . F.B.I. No ! Come on , Jarod . Jarod . Jarod . Jarod . - Jarod , we have to split up . - No . Come on . I can protect you . No . This is not about me now . Your parents . They 're in Boston . They 'll arrive by taxi at this coffee shop . Here 's the address and meet time . Tomorrow at 3 : 00 . Harriet , thank you . [ Raines ] It was a prudent move with Kyle . Keeps our hands clean . [ Mr. Parker ] I think we should focus on bringing Jarod in . We have a possible location . - Where ? When ? - 3 : 00 . Today . Take a Sweeper team with you . Bring him back . [ Wheels Squeaking ] [ Bell Tolling ] - We 're flying blind . - No need , Miss Parker . - Well , don 't count on Mr. Raines feeling the same way . - I don 't . Well , let me show you how to take off the safety , huh ? Damn . I don 't want Jarod hurt . Do my best , Syd . - It 's hot and good to go . - Damn . You take the east . Got that ? You take the west . I 'll float . [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Groaning ] Hello , Jarod . You stole me from my parents . You had the F.B.I. kill my brother . And now you 're trying to kill my family . What have I ever done to you ? You exist . No . I 'm not gonna let you do to me what you did to my brother . You leave me alone . [ Gunshot ] [ Groaning ] I thought he gave up smoking . No . No , no , no . There was no plant . The information on Jarod 's rendezvous with his parents ... came from a phone tap we 've had on St. Catherine 's for over 30 years . Yes , Mr. Lyle . Uh , Jarod got away , but ... You want me to come in ? What for ? Let 's talk now . Whatever you say . I 'll be with you shortly . We will . You have my word . Thank ... Ah . Glad you 're here . - Really ? - Of course . We have work to do . We ? Now that Raines is in doctors ' hands ... or God 's . Skin grafts can be so demanding . Well , at least he 'll be out of your hair . Isn 't that what you wanted ? - Is that what you wanted ? - He overstepped . I dealt with him as promised . Then why was he out on that street yesterday ? Why did he know right whereJarod would be ? Difficult for a man like Raines to end up in hospital ... while sitting behind his desk , don 't you think ? You promised me that we would talk . Did Raines kill Mother ? Honey . There are no easy answers . - Yes or no . - One day you 'll understand why I ... Did he kill her ? There are still great repercussions from your mother 's death . When I can tell you more , I will . - Trust me . - [ Door Opens ] Ah , you 're here to escort me ? Of course you are . [ Mr. Parker Coughs ] A friend of mine in cleanup sent me this . - Ballistics report ? - Uh-huh . - What the hell 's going on here ? - I don 't follow . Well , the bullet that struck the oxygen tank ... They can 't tell which gun it was fired from . [ Phone Rings ] Hello . This is Sydney . Hello . Hello . Who 's there ? I may be tired , Sydney ... but I 'll never give up . I don 't expect you to . I 'll find them again . No one is going to keep me from my family . I understand . Jarod , you were closer to your family than I ever was . I want you to believe that . If it 's my faith you want ... tell me where they buried my brother . - Buried him ? - Kyle . Yes . - Jarod . - Tell me , Sydney . The van 's gas tank was full . It burned for a very long time . No remains were found . Nothing . Nada . Hmm . Which is , yet again , what you leave me with . Jarod . Hello . Are you still there ? I 'm here . With everything that 's happened ... they 're more determined than ever to find you . Do you know where you 'll go ? I have a good idea . - Catch me if you can . - [ Engines Roaring In Distance ] [ Phone Beeps Off ] [ Mews ]

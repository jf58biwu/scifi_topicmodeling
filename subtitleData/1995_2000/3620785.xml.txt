 Hello ? Merry Christmas ! Hello . - Hi ! - Oh , my God ! Look at you ! - How am I gonna get my arms around you ? - It 's not gonna be long now . - You 're huge ! - Dana ... I know . Welcome , welcome . Hi , sweetie . Well , let 's get you two settled . Sorry , Mom . I know you hoped you 'd never spend another night in base housing . - Are you kidding ? This is wonderful . - It 's the exact same layout as our old house . - That 's the navy for you . - Bill tells me , Mom , that you 're staying in your old room and the nursery 's in Dana and Melissa 's room . That 's right . - I got it . - Thanks . Mom ? You OK ? Yeah . Just thinking about your dad . And Melissa . How much I miss ' em . Bill ? - Scully residence . - Dana ? Yes . I 'm sorry , who is this ? Dana , she needs your help . She needs you , Dana . Go to her . Who ... who is this ? - fbi , San Diego . - This is Special Agent Dana Scully . My badge number is 2317-616 . Can you transfer me to your sound agent , please ? I 'd like to trace the last number that was dialed into this phone . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Who are you ? Scully . fbi . Could you tell me what 's going on here ? Well , no offense , Scully fbi . What 's it to you ? I received a phone call from this address . It was a woman 's voice . - She said that somebody here needed help . - When was this ? - About 20 minutes ago . - I been here 30 minutes . I guarantee you , no one 's called out to you or anyone else . Phone 's off the hook . Please , can you tell me what happened here ? This is Mrs Roberta Sim . Age 40 . Suicide . She 's been dead at least three hours . You got a call from her , she must have dialed 1-800-The Great Beyond . What 's going on ? They 're joking about you getting a call from a dead woman . I thought it was a dead woman , just not the one in there . - What are you talking about ? - It 's not possible , - but it sounded just like her . - Who ? Our sister . Melissa . I don 't know what to tell you . Pac Bell does confirm that there was an incoming call from this address to your brother 's house , but from here they show no outgoing call . They confirm the phone 's been off the hook for three hours . - What was their explanation ? - A mix-up . Software glitch . Obviously just some kind of mistake . Anyway , I gotta wrap things up . Talk with the husband . Listen , weird phone calls aside , this is looking pretty straightforward . A lot of people check themselves out around Christmas time . No , this is ... you know , it 's fine . It 's just old . It 's very , very old . Excuse me . Hello ? Excuse me . - Everything OK ? - Yeah . - That was a good one . - Is he kicking ? He 's kicking . Kick boxing . You had boys and girls . Which one kicked more ? I had some pretty tough little girls . I can 't believe I 'm about to say this , big and fat as I am right now . I can 't wait to have more . This is our baby , our son . Kinda gives everything new meaning . I can 't help but think that life before now was somehow less . Just a prelude . What 's the matter ? Nothing . Mom , I 'm very happy for Bill and Tara . You don 't seem to be . Mom ... Several months ago , I learned that , as a result of my abduction , of what they did to me , that I cannot conceive a child . I 'm so sorry . It 's OK . I just never realized how much I wanted it until I couldn 't have it . - Dana , where is it ? Where is that rabbit ? - I 'm not telling . I 'm gonna find that rabbit and cook it . Turn it into stew . - No , you 're not ! - Rabbit stew , here I go . You 're not gonna find him ! Bill ! Scully . She needs your help . Who is this ? Why are you doing this ? Go to her . Mr Sim , my name is Dana Scully . I 'm very sorry for your loss - and I 'm sorry to disturb you at this hour ... - What do you want ? I received a phone call less than an hour ago . I was addressed by name and told that I needed to help someone . A woman . - I traced the call . It came from your house . - I have no idea what you 're talking about . This is the second time this has happened . I 'd like to get to the bottom of it . - You were here earlier . - Yes . The detective told me about a screw-up with the phones . I 'm in the middle of a meeting . No one 's called you from here . Not earlier today , and certainly not tonight . You can 't imagine how bad a day this has been for my daughter and myself . Well , if you understand , you 'll stop coming around upsetting me with this nonsense . Please . Scully fbi . What can I do for you at this ungodly hour ? I 'd like everything you have on the Roberta Sim case . The Roberta Sim case ? There is no Roberta Sim case . It 's a simple suicide . - We went through this before , didn 't we ? - Whatever you wish to call it , I 'd appreciate seeing everything that you have . In the spirit of the season ? So what are you looking for ? Can you even tell me ? It says here your precinct visited the Sims two weeks ago . A domestic disturbance call ? The neighbors were complaining . They were screaming at each other . It wasn 't a happy household . Happy people don 't kill themselves . They ran a tox screen ? Yeah . It 's just procedure . - Says they found high levels of doritriptan . - Some kind of new migraine medicine . Apparently , you take enough , you 're wearing a cloud for a hat . I figure she anesthetized herself , and then ... Found a bunch of empty sample packets in the bathroom trash . Couple more in her purse . I 'd like to borrow this . She 's adopted . Danny ? Hi , it 's me , Dana . Yeah . Merry Christmas to you too . I , uh , I 'm wondering if you can do me a favor . I need the complete case files on my sister , Melissa Scully . Yeah , crime scene and autopsy , along with the PCRs that we ran . Right , but I need you to send them to the San Diego field office . As soon as possible . OK . Thanks , Danny . Dana ? - Is this where you stayed the night ? - Yeah . Some of it . It 's supposed to be a vacation . What you workin ' on that 's so important ? - Just some unfinished business . - Are you up for joining us this morning ? I 've got a little work to do . Can I join you guys later ? - Well , how are you gonna get around ? - I 'll rent a car . All right . Lunch . We 'll hold you to that . Agent Scully . It 's been , what , four hours ? I was gettin ' worried . I 'd like to order an autopsy on Roberta Sim . There 's a possibility she was murdered . What , you got another phone call ? I think it may have been the husband . Where 'd you get that idea ? Want a coffee ? - No , thanks . - He 's got an ironclad alibi . Mr Sim was at the doctor 's office with his daughter . He was there all morning . I checked . I took another look at the police photos this morning . There were no hesitation cuts on Roberta Sim 's wrists . Suicide victims seldom make the fatal cut on the first try . - Seldom , but not always . Is that all you got ? - No . Why was the phone off the hook when you got to the Sims ' house ? The wife took it off . I guess she didn 't wanna be interrupted . Your incident report says the husband called the police after finding his wife dead . Yeah . But if the phone was off the hook , how did he call you ? Did he find the phone off the hook , call you , and then have the presence of mind to return it to the way he found it ? - Does that make sense to you ? - What are you suggesting ? I 'm suggesting that there are questions which beg further investigation . Order an autopsy . Stomach contents appear to include coffee , whole-wheat toast and cantaloupe . No medicine tablets . Empty packets of doritriptan were found , but I see no evidence that pills were ingested . Well , obviously there were . Doritriptan showed up on the tox screen . - Then why didn 't it show up in her stomach ? - It was absorbed into the bloodstream . No . I don 't believe the absorption would be that complete . Not that close to her death . Then how did the doritriptan get in her system , Ms Scully ? - A needle puncture ? - On the heel of her right foot . Extremely tiny and easy to miss . It was meant to be overlooked . I believe this woman was injected , anesthetized so she wouldn 't fight back , then her suicide was staged . - What do you think ? - It 's a possibility . And then again it 's possible this woman stepped on a tack and the rest is blue-sky conjecture . I 'd say it justifies opening a murder investigation . This is your doing . You didn 't have the decency to leave me and my daughter alone ... Mr Sim , please . Now , you 're gonna want to calm down and let us do our business , OK ? - Mr Sim , where 's your daughter right now ? - Why ? She 's at a friend 's house . Thank God she 's not here to see this . Detective ? This was in the trash out back . - You got an explanation for this ? - Yes . My daughter has a severe form of anemia . She requires daily injections . We 'll check that out . I want you to analyze this . Get a PCR on the blood . We need to identify whose it is . Dana ? Are you all right ? It 's two o 'clock in the morning . Where have you been all day ? We were expecting you for lunch . Mom ... Sit down . The woman who committed suicide has an adopted daughter . A three-year-old named Emily . I got a sample of Emily 's blood and I had the lab run a test on her DNA . It 's called a PCR test . This is Emily 's . And this ... is Melissa 's , which we ran during her murder investigation . They match . - What does it mean , " They match " ? - It means ... that this little girl Emily ... is Melissa 's daughter . - It 's not possible . - You can 't deny the remarkable resemblance . Melissa was three years old when this picture was taken . Practically a baby . - All kids can look the same at that age . - Mom , it 's uncanny . Emily looks exactly like Melissa . That 's why I ordered the PCR test . - Her face may change , but her DNA can 't . - And that test is accurate ? There is a 60 % chance that Melissa is Emily 's mother . I 'm going to order a more comprehensive test , an RFLP . It 'll take a couple of days , then we 'll be sure . I am already sure your sister did not have a baby . She would have told me . Remember about four years ago Melissa took off ? She traveled the West Coast . We didn 't know where she was . She was pregnant and didn 't want us to know ? That was 1994 . Emily was born that November . She could have given her up for adoption and none of us would have ever known . Dana , listen to me . I know what you 're going through . Mom , this has nothing to do with anything that I 'm going through . It has happened to me . When your father died , it was a long time before he left me . I saw him in my dreams . The phone would ring and just for a moment I was sure it was his voice . And you 're doing the same thing with Melissa . You 're seeing her in this child . But that does not make this child my granddaughter . We 're still connected to them , Dana . Even after they 're gone . - Look at all the presents . - Dana , quiet . They 'll hear us . - This one 's for me . - You wish . That 's for Billy , you dope . This has gotta be it . It 's gotta be Hotel California . You 'll wake everybody . - I wonder what this is . - I don 't know , but I got one too . You don 't have to shake it , Dana . You can open those now . Thanks , Mom . Your grandmother gave me a cross just like that when I was about your age . It 's pretty . It means God is with you . He 'll watch over you wherever you go . Dana ? Hi . Sorry . There 's a detective here to see you . I 'll be right down . - I know it 's early . - Not a problem . - lnteresting tidbit on Mr Sim . - What ? Bank deposits . Large ones . $ 30,000 a pop . Three in the last 18 months . All the checks have been made out to his wife . The last one was deposited yesterday , apres mort . - Where 'd the cheques come from ? - A pharmaceutical firm in Chula Vista . - Dr Calderon ? - Yes ? I 'm Agent Scully with the fbi and this is Detective Kresge with the San Diego Police . - What can I do for you ? - We 're investigating Roberta Sim 's death . - When did this happen ? - You knew Mrs Sim ? - Her daughter is a patient at our clinic . - What were you treating her for ? She 's a subject in a clinical trial . We 're developing gene therapies for several blood disorders . Emily 's suffering from a rare type of autoimmune hemolytic anemia . She 's a very sick little girl . - What 's her prognosis ? - I really couldn 't say . These are ongoing double-blind trials . It could be years before we have results . You 've been paying the Sim family compensation ? Emily 's a special case . We were lucky to find her . - How did you find her ? - Her father brought her to our attention . Then why are the cheques made out to her mother ? How shall I put this ? These payments are a gesture of goodwill towards Mrs Sim . She wasn 't convinced that our treatment was the way to go . She wanted Emily out of the program ? She filed the paperwork but her husband later withdrew it . Dr Calderon , did you ever prescribe doritriptan injections to Emily ? No . I prescribed them for the husband when he mentioned he suffered from migraines . Marshall Sim , you 're under arrest for the murder of Roberta Sim . - What ? - Where 's Emily ? - Are you out of your mind ? - You have the right to remain silent . - This is crazy . - Anything you say can be used against you ... - I wouldn 't kill my wife . - You have the right to an attorney ... Let 's get you right in there . Let 's just get you buckled in here nice and safe , OK ? You like that , huh ? I 'll see you soon , OK ? Every year my husband insisted on putting the angel on top of the tree by himself . - Man 's work . - Yes . Dana , can you give me a hand in the kitchen ? Yeah . What 's up ? - I need you to tell me what 's going on . - What do you mean ? Dana , you 're a million miles away . I thought you came to see the family . I did . I thought this thing was resolved , that you caught the guy that murdered that woman . We did . Then it 's about the girl , isn 't it ? Mom told me . - You really think Melissa had a baby ? - Yes , I do . She called you from beyond the grave to tell you that ? Sounds like something your partner would say . It does not matter where that phone call came from . What matters is that little girl needs my help . This isn 't about any little girl , Dana . It 's about you . It 's about some emptiness , some void inside yourself that you 're trying to fill . I don 't expect you to understand , but I 'm not going to justify my ... Dana ? There 's a telephone call for you . - Hello ? - Merry Christmas , Agent Scully . Got a little present for you . Marshall Sim just confessed . He admitted to being at the house that morning ? I got a signed statement right here . What about the witnesses that placed him at the doctor 's office ? I guess they were mistaken . Maybe they weren 't . - Where is he now ? - County lockup . - Did they identify themselves ? - They said they were his lawyers . - How long were they here ? - 10 , 15 minutes , tops . Dammit . When did you get back ? - Just now . - You 're just in time . I was on my way over to the neighbors ' . Mom and Tara are already there . What ? What happened ? Marshall Sim , Emily 's adopted father , is dead . - They made it look like suicide , like his wife . - Oh , my God . - Do you know who did it ? - No . Do you think it has something to do with that little girl ? I think it might . Dana , I have to show you something . Look at the date on the back . Does Melissa look pregnant to you in that picture ? - It 's four weeks before the girl was born . - Bill , that doesn 't prove anything . Melissa didn 't have to get pregnant to have a baby . There 's in vitro fertilization , surrogate motherhood ... Dana , listen to yourself . You 're creating this whole scenario to fulfill a dream . - What dream ? - To have a child . Look , I understand . I know the need . God knows , Tara and I tried for years . But making this girl into Melissa 's daughter is not the way . You 're only going to end up hurting yourself . - Hi . - Hi . I 'm here to see Dana Scully . - May I ask ... ? - I 'm Susan Chambliss from the county . It 's about the adoption . Hi . Thanks for coming out on Christmas Eve . Not at all . I don 't understand . I think I have a right to know why you 're rejecting my application . It 's not mine to accept or reject , Dana . We only make recommendations to the judge . But at this point I 'd advise against you becoming an adoptive parent . You 're a single woman who 's never been married or had a long-term relationship . You 're in a high-stress , time-intensive and dangerous occupation . One that I sense you 're deeply committed to . And one which would overnight become the secondary priority to the care and well-being of this child . I 'm not sure this is a sacrifice you 're prepared to make . Well , it 's one that I 've given a great deal of thought to . I mean , to be honest , I 've started to question my priorities since I was first diagnosed with cancer . And I feel like I 've been given a second chance . Ever since I was a child I 've never allowed myself to get too close to people . I 've avoided emotional attachments . Perhaps I 've been so ... afraid of death , and dying , that any connection just seemed like a bad thing . Something that wouldn 't last . But I don 't feel that anymore . I know you 're a trained physician and are aware of Emily 's medical condition . I wanna stress to you , Dana , Emily is a special-needs child . According to her doctors her condition is incurable . She requires constant care , both medical and emotional . The good news is you have firsthand experience of grave illness . The bad news is you 'd have to relive it through the eyes of a child . I realize that . And I feel like I 'm ready . We 'll review your final application and make our recommendations . I wish you luck . - Merry Christmas . - Merry Christmas . I 'll show myself out . Dana ? - Melissa ? - Didn 't know anybody else was up . I couldn 't sleep . How come ? You worried about Quantico , or who gets the most presents this year ? I guess I 'm afraid of making a big mistake . I could tell Dad sure thinks I am . Well , it 's not his life , Dana . Yeah , I know that . But , you know , when I started med school it felt so right . It just seemed like that 's where I was supposed to be . And then by the time I graduated I just knew it was wrong . And now the fbi feels right , and ... - what if that 's wrong too ? - There is no right or wrong . Life 's just a path . Just follow your heart and it 'll take you where you 're supposed to go . God , you sound like a greeting card . I don 't believe in fate . I think we have to choose our own path . Well , just don 't mistake the path with what 's really important in life . - Which is what ? - The people you 're gonna meet on the way . You don 't know who you 're gonna meet when you join the fbi . You don 't know how your life is gonna change , or how you are gonna change the life of others . Good morning . Hey , sleepyhead . Merry Christmas . - Did Santa come ? - Santa 's still here . She always had to be first up at Christmas . Couldn 't wait to get at those presents . OK , enough pleasantries . I 'm dying to know what 's in this box . I 've waited for a month . Let me open it . This one 's from Charles . Don 't open anything . I 'll be right back . fbi courier . Agent Dana Scully , please . No , I 'm afraid I need Agent Scully 's signature , sir . Sorry , ma 'am . They make you sign for everything these days . - Merry Christmas . - Merry Christmas . What is it ? It 's the DNA test on Emily Sim 's blood . What does it say ? It says definitively that Melissa is not Emily 's mother . But they found striking genetic similarities between them , so many that they ... ran a test against another sample that they already had . - What sample ? - What are you trying to say ? According to this , I am Emily 's mother . Visiontext Subtitles : Rob Colling US english

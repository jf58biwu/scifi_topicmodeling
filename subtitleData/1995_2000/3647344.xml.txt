 That 's a little hard to believe . Really ? No , I 'm pretty much of a homebody . But all that changed , just from your words , the way you saw things . I knew I wanted to meet you . Well , I hope you 're not too disappointed . Lauren , we have a real connection , which is rare . Most men don 't feel that way . Most men don 't know what they 're missing . - What ? I can 't believe this . I-I mean , I can 't believe that after three months , we finally meet in person , and you 're ... I don 't know . I 'm just really enjoying myself tonight . Oh , no . Oh . Here . Let me help you . My sister gave it to me . For good luck , I guess . Kind of dopey , huh ? I mean , a cloverleaf . How blatant can you get ? It 's beautiful . Thank you . Cock-a-doodle-doo . Rise and shine in there . Mother of God . Dispatcher , this is car seven-three . I got a D.P. out on the lakefront at Erie and Capitol . Over . We 're not 100 % certain , but from the driver 's license , we suspect that it 's Lauren Mackalvey . I want you to get on it . All right . We 'll check this out . - Why don 't we go and check around ? - Sounds good . Agent Mulder ? Alan Cross , Cleveland P.D. Thanks a lot for coming out so quickly . - This is my partner , Dana Scully . - Hi . We found the purse in the front seat of that car over there . According to the license , her name is , uh , Lauren Mackalvey , but , uh , we 're not sure yet that this is her body . You 're not sure ? We couldn 't make a positive I.D. , considering . Wendy Sparks , she 's our bureau liaison . She thought this would be , uh , closer to your area of expertise . Any indication what would have been the cause of death ? We were lucky to get her into the bag without her body falling apart . This substance , did you find it anywhere else in the car ? In the carpet or the upholstery ? As a matter of fact , no . So , it was only on the victim 's body . That 's what it looks like . Why ? Do you have an idea what happened here ? No . Not yet . We 'll call you when we find anything else concrete . - Detective ? - Yeah , sure . Call me . Mulder , what do you think it is ? A couple months ago , a case came across my desk from the Mississippi office . Four women from Aberdeen had disappeared in less than a month . - Disappeared ? - Only one of the victims was found , but her body was too decomposed to perform a viable autopsy . - What we saw was not decomposition . - I know . I want you to find out what this is while you 're at the coroner 's . What about you ? Where are you going ? I 'm going to try to find out if Lauren Mackalvey was a lonely heart . Each of the Aberdeen victims answered personal ads in the local papers . If this is the same killer , he 's just getting started . Yes . What is it ? The handyman replaced the locks on the storage closets , and I wanted to bring by your new key . I know what you do , Mr. Incanto . What is it you think that I do ? With all your typing and those packages from publishers in New York ? You 're a novelist , right ? Or an editor . You see , I 'm a writer , too . What a coincidence . Shouldn 't you be off writing or something ? I don 't mean to impose , but would you mind reading something of mine ? It won 't take much time . They 're poems . Certainly . Good-bye . Oh , it 's you . That 's not a problem , is it ? No . Just that Dr. Kramer didn 't tell me that you were observing the autopsy . I 'm not observing . I 'm performing it myself . You 're a medical doctor ? You sound surprised . I don 't know . I , uh , I guess maybe I am . - Why ? - It 's nothing personal , Agent Scully . I 'm just ... old-fashioned in certain regards . " Old-fashioned " ? The truth is , I question the wisdom ... of assigning female law enforcement officers to certain types of cases . Like this one ? Whoever killed Lauren Mackalvey has a definite attitude toward women , right ? So this has to be affecting your judgment . I appreciate your concern , Detective , but it 's not necessary . All I want to do is solve this case , just like you . Look . I 'm not being sexist here . I 'm just being honest . Where would you like the autopsy report sent ? You can fax it to my office . The date is August 29 . The time is 4 : 15 p.m. The subject 's name is Lauren Mackalvey , Caucasian , female . Approximate time of death uncertain . Cause of death unknown . It just doesn 't make sense . He seemed so nice . I thought you said you never met the man Lauren was with last night . I never did . He just seemed nice on the computer . Oh , they met through an on-line service ? In one of those chat rooms . You know , where people get together to talk about whatever they 're into . Right . Do you remember what chat room Lauren was in when she met him ? " Big and beautiful . " She had kind of a weight problem . But " 2Shy " didn 't seem to care . It wasn 't about sex with him . - " 2Shy " ? - That was his on-line name . Lauren used to ... read me his letters . They were amazing . He knew exactly what to say . Sure as hell fooled me . She read you his letters . Do you think that she kept any hard copies of them ? Actually ... I saved them myself . If you want , I could get them for you . Yes . Can I use your phone ? Yeah , it 's right over there . - Scully . - Listen , Scully . Our killer may have moved out of the personal columns and onto the internet . I 'm going to send out a localized on-line warning . How do you know it 's the same guy ? Because he opened the account with one of the Aberdeen victim 's credit cards . I just called the on-line service . Mulder , meet me in the coroner 's office as soon as you can . - Did you find anything ? - There 's not going to be an autopsy . It 's a metacarpal from Lauren Mackalvey 's hand . In life , bones have the tensile strength of forged iron . Even in death , they remain strong . But look at this . What did this turn out to be ? It 's organic , mostly hydrochloric acid . Similar to what is secreted by the gastric mucosa . It 's similar to stomach acid ? Almost identical , only twice as acidic . I also found trace amounts of pepsin , which is a digestive enzyme . So , you 're saying that this did that ? I don 't know how else to explain such accelerated autolysis . Okay , what 's in here , Scully , theoretically should contain ... the same cellular components as her various tissues , right ? Skin , muscle , blood . In some broken-down form , yes . In the results of your chemical analysis , did you find anything missing ? - Missing ? - Yeah . I don 't think so . All of the body tissues were accounted for . Except there were extremely low , almost trace amounts of adipose . Fatty tissue . That could explain the weight discrepancy . What weight discrepancy ? Well , the M.E. recorded Lauren 's weight at 122 , but her driver 's license had her at 165 . Well , she probably lost weight since the license was issued . Actually , Lauren 's roommate said she was quite nervous about meeting this guy , because she 'd put on some weight recently . What possible motivation could the killer have ... for removing his victim 's fatty tissue ? I mean , who do you think we 're dealing with here ? I don 't know . God , I look awful . Please tell me it 's the mirror . Ellen , this wasn 't some public-service announcement . It was an on-line warning by the F.B.I. aimed at women in Cleveland . Give me some credit , will you , Jo ? I happen to be a pretty good judge of character . Look . I 'm not trying to freak you out or anything . No ? Well , you 're doing a pretty good job of it . I just think you should be careful , that 's all . Do you think this is easy for me ? I finally connect with someone I like who seems to like me . I 'm scared enough to meet him for the first time ... without you telling me he 's Charles Manson . I didn 't say that . Besides , it 's not like he 's some stranger . I 've been chatting with him every day for over a month . I know . And he 's probably as great as he sounds . But what if he isn 't ? - Check it out . - Want a little chocolate tonight ? - Hey , baby . Right here . Right over here , baby . I 'm here . Got what you need over here , if you 'd like some of this . Ooh , yeah . See something you like ? - You want some ? - He have the hots for you , baby . I think so . - Hey , hey ! What do you like , baby ? Uh-uh . No kissing . Anything else you want is fine , but no kissing . What are you doing ? Aah ! Oh ! There 's a place we can go near here . Nice and cozy . Okay . Uh-uh . Forget this . Oh , my God . Make sure you get statements from all of them . Her name was Holly McClaine . She 's worked this area for a couple of years now , but she wasn 't most Johns ' first pick , if you know what I mean . What happened ? Looks like our guy again . One of the other girls found her . All of the air passages are blocked with what appears to be ... the same viscous hydrochloric acid we found on Lauren Mackalvey . You know what this stuff is ? Hey , this is still my case . We 're dealing with a serial murderer ... who 's using an on-line service to attract his victims . All single women looking for Mr. Right . That doesn 't jibe with a $ 20 hooker . No , it doesn 't . Something must have gone wrong last night . He was forced to improvise . We 're still talking about a guy without a consistent M.O. Not necessarily . These are letters he E-mailed to Lauren Mackalvey . They contain lines from a handful of 16th-century Italian poems . So he has a copy of Bartlett 's Quotations . So what ? You won 't find any of these in Bartlett 's . - I 'm not sure I follow you . - Look at this . Ginaselli 's La Vita Nuova , Castionni 's Il Cortigiano , and a few others I won 't even try to pronounce . These are from obscure text from privately-owned libraries that only lend to academic affiliates . You 're saying our ... our suspect 's a college professor ? Or a graduate student , a visiting fellow , maybe a translator . What we need to do is compile a list of everybody in the Cleveland area ... who has these kind of credentials . - Can you do that ? - Yeah . I 'll get right on it . Here 's something else that might help . The killer should have an identifiable wound pattern from this . Looks like she took her pound of flesh , huh ? Yes ? I got a package for Incanto from Stratcher Publishing . - Leave it . - Sorry . I gotta get a signature . Hello , Mr. Incanto . Good afternoon , Jesse . Jesse , did you find those drop cloths yet ? Oh , Mr. Incanto . I didn 't know you were out here . I 'm just picking up a package . Jesse , did you know that Mr. Incanto 's a writer ? I know , Mom . You told me a thousand times . I 'm putting those poems together . If you don 't mind , I 'd like to drop them by sometime . just slip it under my door . After you 've read them , can I take you to dinner somewhere ? - Give me a break . - I 'm busy . I have a deadline . I don 't believe this . - Excuse me . I wish you weren 't always so rude to him . I don 't care . He creeps me out . Plus he smells gross , like he uses dish soap for after shave . Okay . Blaine just gave me the list from the university . How 's it going over here ? Good . We 're just expanding the search ... to include the faculty rosters from the local community colleges . We ... Oh , excuse me . Sure . I 'll let you know what we turn up . Did you find anything ? We 're almost done with the list . That skin you found under the prostitute 's fingernails ? I had the lab check the DNA results against the known offenders database . And ? Well , it says here they didn 't find a match . No , but they did find something else . Check the next page where it 's circled . " The skin sample contains no oils or essential fatty acid . " There are any number of factors which could have caused that result . Where are you going with this ? Okay , it 's not yet the finely-detailed insanity you 've come to expect from me . It 's just a theory , but what if he 's not doing this ... out of a psychotic impulse but rather out of some physical hunger ? Maybe he needs to replenish this chemical deficiency to survive . From a dry-skin sample , you 're concluding what ? That he 's some kind of a fat-sucking vampire ? I don 't know how else to explain Lauren Mackalvey 's missing adipose . I bet if you check the Aberdeen victims , you 'd find exactly the same thing . This killer secretes a digestive substance which renders the fat ... Which he ingests before the rest of the body dissolves entirely . There are examples of this in nature , aren 't there ? Yeah , scorpions predigest their food outside of their body ... by regurgitating onto their prey . But I don 't know too many scorpions who surf the internet . Okay , but if I 'm right , then we 're not just looking for a serial murderer . We 're looking for some kind of genetically-different human being , a creature who may be responsible for who knows how many missing persons ... throughout the United States . We 've combed every faculty list and academic journal in Cleveland . Came up with 38 names . I figured we 'd divvy up the list , and I 'd get the captain to put more people on it . I 'd like to brief them , if that 's okay with you . Sure . - You have mail . Mr. Brenman ? I 'm Special Agent Scully from the F.B.I. Would you mind if I ask you some questions ? Thanks . I 'm sorry to bother you . I 'd like to ask you a few questions . Sure . These are all university addresses . Chances are he spent most of the morning on campus . Scully . I wouldn 't have made a good Amway salesman . - I knocked on more doors than ... - Cross hasn 't checked in yet . We 've been trying his cell phone , but there 's no answer . - I 'm treating you . - No , I insist . After the way I stood you up , I 'm the one who should insist . Please ? I 'm sorry . I shouldn 't have ... It 's a kind of eczema . I 've had it since I was a kid . Oh . You know , I still feel so stupid about the other night . Ellen , you don 't have to make any excuses . Whatever reasons you had , I 'm sure they were good ones . You were right , though , about me being afraid . It 's a pretty hard habit to break . You 're not still afraid , are you ? - No , I 'm not . - Good . Unfortunately , I have to get going . The last cross town bus leaves in 15 minutes . - You 're taking the bus home ? - My car 's in the shop . I 'll call you . - Don 't be silly . I 'll drive you . - Ellen , you don 't have to . I 'm driving you home . Mr. Incanto ? So , how long have you lived here ? Not very long . You know , I only live a few blocks away , near St. Mark 's , until some developer decided to turn it into condos . You can still see the steeple . Ellen , you don 't have to be nervous . I 'm not very good at this . It 's been a long time since I 've been in this type of situation . It 's okay . Why don 't you come up with me ? I 'll read you that poem I told you about ... Il Cassone . I don 't know . It 's kind of late . Well , I don 't want to say good night just yet , do you ? You know what ? You 're absolutely right . It 's late . I have a lot of work I have to do . Excuse me . Mr. Incanto ? Mr. Incanto ? What is it , Jesse ? Uh , do you know where my mom is ? Your mother ? No . She takes a class down at St. Frank 's tonight , a poetry class , and she was supposed to be home over an hour ago . I 'm sure she 'll be home soon . She didn 't stop by to say hi or anything ? No . Not tonight . Okay . Thanks . She 'll probably be home soon . I 'm going to New York for a few days on business . Don 't worry about your mother . I 'm sure she 'll be fine . - Cleveland P.D. - His name 's Cross . That 's right . He would have been by sometime this afternoon . Maybe sometime this morning . Do you remember what time specifically ? Could you describe him tome for verification ? Excuse me a minute . Did you find him ? We just got a 911 reporting a possible homicide ... from a young girl at one of the addresses on Cross 's list . Police ! Clear back here . We got two inhere . Mulder . The landlady 's body . We found her in the bathroom . What about Cross ? I know this is hard to talk about right now , but I need you to tell me exactly what happened . I smelled her perfume . Your mother 's perfume ? That 's when I knew he was lying . She was wearing her perfume when she left for class . And you smelled it in his apartment ? I was ... I was scared that he 'd hurt me . I could tell he wanted to . And then he grabbed me . He grabbed you ? After I bumped into the suitcase , he grabbed me pretty hard . What suitcase ? It was next to the door . He said he was going away on business or something . Did he say where ? Um , New York . Okay , Jesse , that helps us . I 'm gonna take a couple minutes and go talk to Agent Mulder . Mrs. Shepherd is right here . I 'll be right back . - Agent Scully ? - Yeah . Why would someone do this ? I don 't know , Jesse . The composite artist came up with this sketch from a neighbor 's description . His name is Virgil Incanto . That 's what it says on his rental agreement . But other than that , there 's no record the guy even exists . There 's no D.M.V. , no birth certificate , no Social Security , not even a bank account . - What about employment records ? - He 's a translator of Italian literature . Freelance . His publisher pays him in cashier 's checks . He told the girl he was on his way to New York . I 'll check fight schedules and have the airport issue an A.P.B. What is it ? He 's not going to New York , Scully . Not now . He 's smarter than that . He knows how to survive , you know ? Well , how are we going to track him ? Well , he made contact with each one of his victims , right ? - Yeah . - That means they 're all here somewhere . Each one of them ... past , present and future . All the files have been deleted . - Any chance of resurrecting them ? - It 's hard to say . He deliberately reformatted his hard drive . This guy didn 't want anyone looking at his stuff . Hmm . The good news is ... I can restore the erased files . And the bad news ? These files are all password-protected and encrypted . It could take some time . Well , we don 't have much time . It 'll take as long as it takes . Joanne ? Is that you ? Joanne ? Who is it ? Ellen , it 's me . - It 's late . - I know . And I 'd like not to wake your neighbors . Can we talk about what happened tonight ? There 's nothing to talk about . You made it pretty clear what you wanted . - No , you don 't understand . - I think I do . Look , Ellen . I gave you a second chance ... after you kept me waiting in that restaurant for two hours . Give me the same courtesy , please . And then if you want me to go , I 'll go . Only , let 's not do it out here . Thank you . You want some coffee ? I can make some . Yeah . I 'd like that . You 're right , Mulder . They 're coming up empty at the airport . So I 'm releasing the sketch to the media . We still have time to make the morning papers . That may not be necessary . - " Friend " ? - That was Mackalvey 's on-line name . These are all his victims . It 's a regular grocery list . We need this scanned and sent to everyone on that list . Done . I 'm gonna call the on-line service and have them fax us ... the telephone numbers of all those women . The machine will pick up . Milk ? - I only have nonfat . - No , no , no , this is fine . - Give me a minute , will you ? I 'd like to put on some clothes . Ellen , you don 't have to do that . I want to . I 'll be right back . Just lock your doors until we contact you again . You 'll be fine , Ms. Innes . He doesn 't tend toward forcible entry . Okay , thanks . That was Cleveland P.D. They 've reported three women on the list as missing . Well , we 've already contacted everyone on this list , except for these two . - I left messages on their answering machines . - We 'd better check on them . - You have mail . Ellen ? I hope you 're not on-line with some other guy . I was just E-mailing my girlfriend . - Your girlfriend ? - Yes . What about ? Us . What were you telling her ? just how happy I am ... that you 're still interested in me ... and that you hadn 't rejected me like I thought you had . I 'm glad you feel that way , Ellen . I know I do . Look . I still haven 't changed my clothes . Why don 't you go wait outside , and I 'll be right out ? You look beautiful , Ellen . You don 't need to change for me . Please leave me alone . Please . What do you want ? No ! Could I help you ? We 're with the F.B.I. We 're looking for Ellen Kaminsky . She 's in her condo . She just E-mailed me a few minutes ago . - Why ? What 's wrong ? Is something the matter ? - Get back in . Ellen ? Mulder . You go ahead . I 'll stay here . Go . This is Federal Agent Dana Scully . I need an ambulance right away to 658 South Hudson Avenue , apartment number 23 . Request special chemical burn unit . Freeze ! Federal Agent ! Now put your hands up and step out where I can see you . Just ... Just don 't shoot me , man . Jennifer Flasket , Kathy Miller , Hillary Turk . Forty-seven women reported missing in five states . At least give their families some peace of mind ... and tell us how many are on that list because of you . They 're all mine . Come on , Scully . Open the door . Why ? When you look at me , you see a monster . But I was just feeding a hunger . You 're more than a monster . You didn 't just feed on their bodies , you fed on their minds . My weakness was no greater than theirs . I gave them what they wanted . They gave me what I needed . Not anymore . The dead are no longer lonely . Let me out . supplied by CoBeR coberus @ go2.pl

 As new employees , I 'd like your opinion on our commercial . I 've paid to air it during Super Bowl . - Wow . - Not on the same channel , of course . lnterplanetary delivery . What a headache ! Evans , where 's the package from Earth ? Uh ... I 'm not Evans ! He should have used Planet Express ! When companies aren 't brave or foolhardy trust Planet Express for reliable delivery . Here 's your package , Mr. Horrible Gelatinous Blob . Good work , Evans . You 've got a future around here . Thank you , sir . Planet Express . Our crew 's replaceable . Your package isn 't . - Are there really giant birds ? - No , that was all just special effects . Now let 's have breakfast . I hope everyone likes eggs . I can 't get used to the 31 st century . Caffeinated bacon . Baconated grapefruit . Admiral Crunch ? If you don 't like that , try Archduke Chocula . Ah , Hermes ! Crew , meet Hermes Conrad . He manages my delivery business , pays the bills notifies next of kin , what have you . Someone dropped off this package . Which of you is the captain ? Oh , my . I haven 't picked a new captain yet . It 's always so hard to choose . Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ! - You ! - Oh ! OK , captain . This is just a standard legal release protecting Planet Express from lawsuits in event of the unforseen . " Death by airlock failure . " " Death by brain parasite . " - " Death by sonic diarrhea . " - You don 't want that . I don 't know about previous captains but I intend to do as little dying as possible . Sign the paper . Now , Fry , before you go into space , you 'll need to see our staff doctor . I should warn you , though . He 's a little unusual . He wears sandals . Dr. Zoidberg , this is Fry , the new delivery boy . He needs a physical . Excellent . Excellent . You 'll be fine . Open your mouth and let 's look at that brain . No , no , not that mouth . I only have one . Really ? - Is there a human doctor around ? - Young lady , I 'm an expert on humans . Now pick a mouth , open it and say ... Uh ... What ? ! My mother was a saint ! Get out ! Dear lord , Bender , you 're filthy . Yeah , like you don 't have crap in your neck . Amy , give his body a going-over with the cleaning pick . Okay . Does it hurt when I go like this ? Ow ! A little . Well , he doctor says I 'm healthy . Can I go into space now ? As soon as we finish cleaning Bender . Oh , and Fry ... This is our intern , Amy Wong . She 's an engineering student of mine . I like having her around . She 's the same blood type as me . Hey , you 're the unfrozen guy from the 20th century , right ? Last time I checked . Hang on . Amy Wong ? Of the Mars Wongs ? Look , we 're not as rich as everybody says . - What 's your sorority ? - Kappa Kappa Wong . Hey , rich girl , look over here ! It 's me , Bender . I 'm being entertaining . La-la-la , look at my head ! It 's all painted , look at my head ! I got a big old head , and hey , ho ! Show 's over , I 'm tired . Ah , to be young again and also a robot . Now as I recall you youngsters have a package to deliver . Finally ! Come on , Bender . Let 's mosey . Nice catch , idiot . - So , where are we going anyway ? - Nowhere special . The moon . The moon ? The moon moon ? Wow ! Im gonna be a famous hero . Just like Neil Armstrong and other brave guys no one 's heard of ! Oh ! I love stuff like the moon . Can I come ? Well , I guess so . Just be careful . I 'd like to hold off any major screwups until at least my second day as captain . Nothing will go wrong . If something goes wrong , bring back the blood . - Can I do the countdown ? - Sure . Knock yourself out . 10 , 9 ... Okay , we 're here . 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , blastoff . - Hurry up ! I want to see the moon ! - Relax , it 's open till 9 . That 's one small step for Fry ... And one giant line for admission . Can I have cuts ? No . You 're not gonna believe this . We landed an amusement park on the moon ! It 's the happiest place orbiting Earth . - Let 's go already . - Fry , we have a crate to deliver . Let 's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it . Too much work . Let 's burn it and say we dumped it . - OK ... If everyone 's finished being stupid ... - I had more , but you go ahead . We 'll deliver that crate like professionals . I 've never been to the moon . All right , we 'll deliver that crate like professionals then we 'll ride the bumper cars . Amy , why don 't you help Fry hoist the crate , then lock up when you 're done . Be careful . Aye , aye , captain . I mean , only one eye . I mean , yes , sir . Ma 'am . - Clear ? - Clear . - Ready to hoist ? - Ready . Ow ! My first space delivery . Greetings , Moon Man . We come in peace . I am Fry , from the planet Earth . Wise guy . If I wasn 't so lazy , I 'd punch you in the stomach . - But you are lazy , right ? - Oh , don 't get me started . Hi ! I 'm Crater Face ! Welcome to Luna Park ! I 'll have to confiscate your alcohol . Better mascots than you have tried . At least I still have my self-respect . Who buys this trash ? Idiots who need gifts for other idiots . Hey ! I got you guys refrigerator magnets ! Get it off ! Get it off ! Get it ... Uh-oh ! ♫ How many roads must a man walk down Before you ... ♫ Keep those things off of me . Magnets screw up my inhibition unit . So you flip out and start acting like some crazy folk singer ? Yes . I guess a robot would have to be crazy to want to be a folk singer . ♫ We 're whalers on the moon We carry a harpoon ♫ ♫ But there ain 't no whales so we tell tall tales and sing a whaling tune ♫ Bender ! Bender ! Over here ! Oh , jeez . I went to high school with that guy . Monsanto presents " The Goophy Gopher Revue ! " Why does moon rock taste better than Earth rock ? Because it 's a little meatier . This is weak . Address all complaints to the Monsanto Corporation . What 's wrong , Fry ? I don 't know . This place is great , but it 's so artificial . The gravity , the air , the gophers . You might as well stay on Earth . That 's what I came to see ! I want to go out and jump like an astronaut . Screw this phony stuff . But the phony stuff is what 's fun . It 's boring out there . You 're the kind of guy who visits Jerusalem and doesn 't see the Sexeteria . Maybe I should take Fry on the lunar rover ride . You get to wear a spacesuit and drive around on the surface . And the line is short , because it 's educational . I don 't care how educational it is . Let 's do it ! Next year in Jerusalem ! Finally . Get ready for some serious moon action . The story of lunar exploration started with one man : A man with a dream . One of these days , Alice ! Bang ! Zoom ! Straight to the moon ! Wow ! I never realized the first astronauts were so fat . That 's no astronaut . It 's a TV comedian . And he 's using space travel as a metaphor for beating his wife . Wow ! I could swear I was really playing Virtual Skeeball ! Look , it 's that crate we were gonna throw in the sewer . The keys to the ship ! They must have fallen into the crate . - Leela 's gonna kill me . - No , she 'll probably make me do it . Mister , could you get those keys out for me ? What do I look like , a guy who 's not lazy ? No one knows where , when or how man first landed on the moon . - I do . - But our fun-gineers think it might 've happened something like this : ♫ We 're whalers on the moon We carry a harpoon ♫ ♫ But here ain 't no whales so we tell tall tales and sing a whaling tune ♫ That 's not how it happened . Oh , really ? I don 't see you with a fun-gineering degree . This is stupid . I 'll take this out to the real moon . Fry , no . This is my first mission , and I won 't let us get in any trouble . - Besides , the car 's on a track . - Not for long . I died doing what I loved . Okay , you 're on the surface . Now I 'll give you 10 minutes . Then you 'll get bored , turn around and apologize for being a jerk . - Agreed . - Agreed . Yee-haw ! Whoo ! Yeah ! Crank up the radio ! ♫ We 're whalers on the ... ♫ Time 's up . Make a U-turn at the next crater . No ! Not yet ! How about we look for the original moon landing site ? That 's crazy . - It 's been lost for centuries . - Well , I 'm feeling lucky . Ooh ! Ow ! Ooh ! Ooh ! Ow ! Ooh ! Uh ... I 'm ready to go back now . We 're gonna die ! It 's every man for himself ! Help me , Leela ! You did it . We 're safe . No . Now we 're gonna die . It 's every man for himself ! - Hey , look what I won this from a tourist 's pocket . - Shut up ! You 're distracting me ! Come on , it 's just like making love . You know , left , down , rotate 62 ° , engage rotor . Ugh , I know how to make love ! Oh ! Here , let me do it . Uh ... Ee ... Lousy arm . Must be rigged . That 's her , officers ! That 's the woman who programmed me for evil ! Yeah , well , I 'm gonna go build my own theme park with blackjack and hookers . In fact , forget the park . I 'm sorry , Leela . I can 't go on any further . Just leave me in that barn over there . Thank God ! - Trespassers , eh ? - No , we 're amusement park patrons . That 's a wicked , sinful place . Tilt-A-Whirl 's okay , but the rest is mighty wicked . Our car broke and we 're out of oxygen . Can we borrow some ? Borrow ? Looky here , city girl . Oxygen don 't grow on trees . You 'll earn it doing chores on my hydroponic farm . You can go back to your theme park at sunup . I guess we could do chores for a few hours . Night lasts two weeks on the moon . Yep . Drops down to minus 173 . Fahrenheit or Celsius ? First one , then the other . Them spacesuits ain 't heated . You 're going nowhere till sunrise . You can sleep in the barn . Just don 't be a-touching my three beautiful robot daughters , you hear ? Robot daughters ? - This here is Lulabelle Seven . - Yoo-hoo ! - Daisy Mae 1 28K . - Yoo-hoo ! And the Crush-A-Nator ! Yoo-hoo . Whoo . I told you to turn around and go back to the park . But oh no , the park was too phony . We had to see the real moon . It was great ! We saw craters and rocks and that one incredible rock that looked like a crater , and these fellas . Fry , face it . The moon 's a dump . A boring , dried-up wasteland . And the only reason anybody ever come here is for the tacky amusement park . - Can 't you accept that ? - I guess I can 't . I 'll learn you to sleep with my robot daughters ! - He 'll never find me in here ! - Bender ? Uh , Bender ... You didn 't touch the Crush-A-Nator , did you ? Of course not . A lady that fine , you gotta romance first . Oh , no , you don 't ! Come here , Crush-A-Nator ! Yes , Pa . - It 's too low ! - Hang on . Hang on . Jump ! Hold on to your helmet ! - Yes ! - Oh , boy ! Goldarn it , Crush-A-Nator ! Jump ! No , Pa . I love him . Oh ! Hey , cool ! Dark side of the moon . Nightfall 's coming . - Hurry , before we freeze ! - What do you mean " we , " mammal ? Oh , dear . I really ought to do something . But I am already in my pajamas . We can 't outrun it forever . Over there ! Look ! It 's the moon landing site ! We found it ! Quick , get in . It 's that flag from MTV ! And Neil Armstrong 's footprint ! Hey ! My foot 's bigger . Isn 't this the greatest thing you 've ever seen ? Fry , look around . It 's just a crummy plastic flag and a dead man 's tracks in the dust . Now get in here before you freeze . Oh , no room for Bender , huh ? Fine . I 'll build my own lunar lander , with blackjack and hookers . In fact , forget the lunar lander and the blackjack . Screw the whole thing . Well , if the oxygen holds out , we might live long enough to starve to death . Look , Leela . I 'm sorry . I never should have dragged you out here . That 's right , you shouldn 't have ! I still don 't get what the big attraction is . I never told anybody this but the thousand years ago I used to look up to the moon and dream of being an astronaut . I just didn 't have the grades , nor physical endurance . Plus , nobody liked spending a week with me . A week would be a little much . The moon was this awesome , mysterious thing hanging in the sky where you 'd never reach it , no matter how much you wanted to . But you 're right . Once you 're actually here , it 's just a big , dull rock . I guess I wanted you to see it through my eyes , the way I used to . Fry , look . It really is beautiful . I don 't know why I never noticed before . Had to come back for the Crush-A-Nator , ey Robot ? Well , I got you this time . It 's Amy ! We 're saved ! Where did she learn to operate the controls like that ? Not the magnet ! No ! No ! No ! Uh-oh . ♫ She 'll be coming around the mountain when she comes ♫ I 'll kill you , Amy ! ♫ She 'll be coming around the mountain She 'll be coming around the mountain ♫ Dang it ! ♫ She 'll be riding six white horses When she comes ♫ ♫ She 'll be riding six white horses When she comes ♫ Hey , I 'm pretty good . ♫ She 'll be riding six white horses ... ♫ So Fry , was the real moon anything like the moon you used to dream about ? Well , close enough . ♫ Well , I 'll shoot her with my railgun when she comes ♫ ♫ Yes , I 'll shoot her with my railgun when she comes ♫ ♫ Yes , I 'll shoot her with my railgun , oh I 'll shoot her with my railgun ♫ ♫ Yes , I 'll shoot her with my railgun when she comes , when she comes ♫ ♫ I 'll be blasting all the humans in the world ♫ ♫ I 'll be blasting all the humans in the world ♫ ♫ I 'll be blasting all the humans , I 'll be blasting all the humans ♫ ♫ I 'll be blasting all the humans in the world , in the world ! ♫ One more time !

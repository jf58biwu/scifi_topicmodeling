How bad do you want this job ? ' Cause I 'll call the head office right now ! - # # [ Continues ] - Super Patty Double ... with cheese , super size fries , super size Diet Sprite .

[ Soft Growling ] - [ Roaring ] - [ Gasping ] [ Screaming ] [ Slurping , Eating Sounds Continue ] You are your own man , and you control everything you do . - How ya doin ' ? - Hey , Rob . - Hey , Mr. Rice . - How 's it going , Rob ? - Have a good one , Lucy . - You too , Rob . [ Siren Wails ] Welcome to Lucky Boy . May I take your order ? - Yeah , we 'll have it our way . - F.B.I. Special Agents Scully and Mulder . - We 'd like a word with your manager , please . - How can I help you ? Sir , would you do us a favor and gather your employees , please ? - What 's going on ? - We 're investigating a murder . A car was found in a reservoir ten miles from here . A body was found in the trunk of that car . - Well , what does that have to do with us ? - This was also found in the car . It 's a badge that 's only given to employees . Is that correct ? Yeah . " Free Fer Fridays . " It 's our promotion ... where you buy one Super Patty and get one free . But look , there 's four Lucky Boys in Costa Mesa alone , and something like 30 in Orange County . - Thirty-two . - Yeah , long day , so let 's make this quick . - Does everybody have their button ? - We only wear them on Fridays . " Free Fer Fridays . " Yeah , but does everybody have their button ? Hey , uh , you back there . What 's your name ? Derwood Spinks . Derwood . Do you have your button , Derwood ? Uh , no , I must have left it at home , on account of we 're supposed to only wear ' em on Fridays . Well , I sure as hell didn 't leave it on no dead guy . I don 't believe that we said the victim was male . We 're gonna ask everybody to step outside right now ... - while we take a quick look around the premises . - Who was the victim ? His name was Donald Edward Pankow . Does that ring a bell ? No . I 'm gonna get some cigarettes . I guess I 'd better call the corporate headquarters ... and find out what they want us to do . [ Mulder ] Hey , Scully . Check it out . You know how they say ... you never wanna see the kitchen of any of your favorite restaurants ? Somehow , I don 't think Lucky Boy would make that list . My point being that this is a hell of a lot cleaner than all the others . - Don 't you think ? - I guess . So what are you saying , Mulder ? This place has been scrubbed from top to bottom ... - [ Continues Over Loudspeaker ] To cover up evidence ? - [ Mulder ] Maybe . Maybe I 'm thinking this was the crime scene . [ Scully ] You 're saying Mr. Pankow had his brain ... very neatly removed from his skull right here in this kitchen ? It had to happen somewhere . But next to the shake machine , Mulder ? I think that we should be checking out employee lockers , and not entertaining the idea that ad hoc surgery was performed here . I wouldn 't exactly call it " surgery . " What if this man 's brain was eaten ? It 's not sociologically unheard of . There are certain tribes in New Guinea that consider human brains a delicacy . - Yeah , but , Mulder , we 're in Orange County . - Yeah ? What 's your point ? It 's just that ... nothing about the way the body was dumped suggests a fetishistic killing . The brain wasn 't removed intact . What if this man 's brain was eaten right out of his skull ? Through an inch and a half opening that looks like it was cut with a hole saw ? [ Mulder ] Well , maybe it was cut . Maybe it was punched . What looked like tool marks to you looked to me like something more organic . Like it was made by a ... a tongue , or a proboscis . The proboscis of what ? I don 't know . Oh . Hello . Look at this . Does that look like blood to you ? - [ Scully ] Yes , it looks like it . - [ Mulder ] What is that ? Next to it . Is that , uh ... Oh , my ... Uh . Is that brain ... Is that brain matter there ? No , I 'd say that 's ground beef . - [ Mulder ] Ground beef ? - Yeah . [ Knocking On Door ] Rob Roberts ? It 's Agent Mulder . Hello , again . I 'm sorry to bother you at home . - No . No bother . - Can I come in ? - Yeah , s-sure . Sure . - Great . Great . Uh , what ... what can I do for you ? - You live here alone ? - Yeah , it 's just me . - Mom or girlfriend ? - What ? Come on , man . Who cleans up after you ? Neither . It 's just me . L-I live here alone . Well , bravo . You know , they say single guys are just bears who own furniture . I mean , my place , it 's ... But here , you can smell the Pine Sol . - Thanks . Can I ... Can I get you anything ? - Yeah . Yeah , a cheeseburger and a large order of fries . [ Weak Chuckle ] It 's a bad joke . I 'm sorry . Um , Mr. Rice , your manager , he told me that , uh , you stayed late on Friday . - Is that right ? - Uh , yeah , sure . Friday . The freezer had died on us . I stayed after to throw out the meat that was goin ' bad . - Yeah , did you volunteer to close ? - Yeah . Yeah , okay . You volunteered . Volunteered . Um ... The , uh ... The 35 pounds of ground chuck ... that Mr. Rice told you to throw away ... what did you do with that ? - I threw it out . - Where ? In the Dumpster ... behind the restaurant . Hmm . That 's weird . That 's what I figured you did , so I checked the Dumpster , and it was empty . Which is weird because it only gets cleaned out on Thursday , and you would 've thrown away the meat on Friday . So you 'd expect the meat to be there , right ? I don 't see how that 's relevant to this murder case anyway . Let me see if there 's anything else I wanted to ask you . Blood . You 're-You 're bleeding . L-I bit my lip . Hmm . I think that just about wraps it up for me here , actually . Oh , hey , I , uh ... I hope you catch the guy , huh ? No , I already got a pretty good idea who it is . Thanks . - What do you want ? - N-Nothing . So take a hike . [ Telephone Ringing ] [ Woman Over Machine ] Uh , hi . This is a message for Rob Roberts . My name is Dr. Mindy Reinhart , and I 'm a licensed mental health counselor ... with the Lucky Boy Corporation 's Employee Assistance Program . I 'm talking to all of the employees at your restaurant ... about the recent unpleasantness that occurred there . Rob , I 'd love for you to come down to my offce at 11 ; 00 a.m. Tomorrow morning . As it is a requirement of your employer 's insurance provider , this meeting is mandatory . I 'm in the Irvine Medical Park , suite 308 . - Have a good evening . - [ Machine Beeps ] [ Stomach Growling Loudly ] Self-discipline . That 's the name of this game . That 's the one thing that separates us from the animals , provided you have it . So where do you get it ? You can 't go down ... to the local convenience store and buy self-discipline . You can 't order it over the internet . So where does it come from ? True story . I used to weigh 356 pounds . [ Whistles ] Do you believe that ? Well , it 's true . I lived to eat , ladies and gentlemen . My entire life revolved around eating , because I was always hungry . My appetite was controlling me . Four-star restaurants , Denny 's ... It didn 't matter , and it didn 't stop . It didn 't stop until I took charge of my own life . It didn 't stop until I put on the brakes and I said , " Whoa ! " [ Together ] Ricardo , you are your own man , and you control everything that you do . [ Applause ] Oh , brother . What ? [ Gasps , Screams ] [ Flesh Tearing ] [ Gasps ] What ... Derwood . How did you get in here ? It 's a little skill I picked up in Chino . I did a nickel for attempted murder . You didn 't know I was an ex-con ? Yeah , nobody at work did . Not until this F.B.I. Murder investigation ... whipped everybody up into a froth . Derwood , what can I do for you ? You know I got fired last night ? Stupid little pissant job , where they make you wear a paper hat . And they fred me . Plus , as far as that , uh , redheaded F.B. I agent 's concerned , I 'm the prime suspect in this murder . But that 's no skin off my nose , seeing as you did it . Diet pills . Yours , right ? See , I found ' em when I opened up on Saturday morning . I didn 't give ' em back because I figured , hey , free speed , right ? But then there 's this whole flap about a murder , and I noticed this . That ain 't ketchup , man . What-What do you want , Derwood ? I don 't know . What do you got ? TV , VCR . Nah , it 's all crappy , off-brand stuff . But , you know , I 'll take that , and whatever money you got in the bank , and you get this , and I keep my mouth shut . And just maybe you can blow town ... before the long arm of the law reaches out and grabs you by the gonads . [ Knocking ] Maybe not . Cup ' em . Uh ... Hi . Uh , Rob ? I hate to bother you , but last night in the front of the building , there was a man in a parked car for hours . Did you happen to see him ? It was a maroon car . He was pretty clean-cut , so I didn 't call the police . But he was still there when I went to bed . Gee , Sylvia , I don 't know what to tell you . Well , he 's gone now , but just , you know , keep your eyes out in case he comes back . - You got it . - Thanks . - [ Door Closes ] - So I 'll call you tonight and let you know ... where to drop off my new VCR . Oh . And don 't try skipping town . You won 't get too far . [ Car Door Opens , Closes ] Hey , just the man I wanted to see . How are you this morning , Rob ? - Fine . - Yeah . I 'm glad I caught you . Oh , hey , I was just driving to your apartment , and I saw Derwood Spinks not a block from here . - He wasn 't coming from your place by any chance , was he ? - No , I haven 't seen him . Good . I 'd stay away from him . He 's our prime suspect in the Pankow murder . - You think he did it ? - Me ? No . No , I should say ... that 's the opinion of the Costa Mesa Police , and my partner . So he 's not your guy ? No . No , I think we 're looking for somebody who has a compulsion to kill . Truly can 't help himself . Oh , quick question . The , uh ... The meat that you threw in the Dumpster ? - What about it ? - The Dumpster had a padlock . - Yeah . - Who would have the key ? We do , and the trucking company does . Hey , wait . What 's your point ? I 'm just tying up some loose ends . [ Reinhart ] Good , you got my message , Rob . I appreciate your coming . This will be really informal . Here you go . I wanna run through some things with you . We don 't stand on ceremony here , so if there 's anything that you want to talk about , just go ahead and blurt it out , okay ? Hasn 't been a run-of-the-mill week so far , has it ? No . The police have been at the restaurant , and the F.B.I. I 'm sure this has been a very stressful time for you . Pretty much . So we wanna keep on top of any potential problems ... that these stresses might cause for you . - So let 's run through some standard questions together . - [ Stomach Growling Loudly ] [ Shuffling Papers ] Rob , have you been troubled recently by insomnia ? - Bad dreams ? Nightmares ? - [ Growling Continues ] Have you felt emotionally numb ? Have you felt emotionally numb ? Do you ever see things that aren 't there , or hear voices ? [ Heartbeat Pounding Loudly ] - Tell me , Rob , do you feel ... - This ... This murder ... This murder that happened ? Yes ? What kind of a monster would do something like that ? I don 't believe in monsters . But I do believe in people . And sometimes , they do terrible things ... out of weakness or sickness or fear . But I do truly believe that deep down inside , even the worst of us wants to be good . Rob , is there anything that 's troubling you that you 'd like to talk about ? [ Telephone Ringing ] I 'm sorry . I thought I put that on voice mail . Mindy Reinhart . Yes , Agent Mulder . What can I do for you ? No , I 'm afraid I can 't do that . I 'm sorry , but it would violate patient confidentiality . I , uh ... Excuse me , Agent ... Rob ? Yeah ? I have to go to work now . Would you please call me later so that we can finish our talk ? You shouldn 't be here , Derwood . We would 've mailed you your last check . Just give me my money , Rice . [ Scoffs ] How you doin ' , killer ? You better have some money for me too , huh ? There . Now please leave . With pleasure , pal . Oh , I ought to just make happy hour . Since this is farewell , when nobody was looking , I used to dip my boys in the coleslaw . - Ew ! - Ew ! [ Chuckling ] Bon appetit . [ Motorcycle Approaching ] [ Engine Shuts Off ] If somebody 's still in here , you 're in a world of hurt ! [ Clattering ] Rob ? You lookin ' for these ? The deal 's off , buddy . You know that guy you iced , Pankow ? I just heard he didn 't have a brain in his head . You 're one sick little freak , man . You got a lot of problems . If I were the F.B.I. , I 'd want you real bad . Public enemy number one and all that . Lots of reward money . So I 'm gonna turn you in myself , " lucky boy . " [ Knocking ] - Rob . - Hi . You said we should finish talking . Come in . - I think I need help . - Tell me why you think that . I have compulsions to eat . L-I get hungry . And I try to put it off for as long as I can , but then finally , I just ... I get so hungry that I can 't help myself , and ... You binge , then purge ? You eat too much , and then cause yourself to vomit ? No . I just eat . But this makes you feel bad . I guess it makes me feel like I 'm not a good person . Rob , there are so many different kinds of eating disorders . Men and women from every walk of life suffer from them . But if there 's one thing that they all have in common , it 's low self-esteem . And it 's a shame because low self-esteem can be like a fun house mirror . It reflects back a warped and ugly image of ourselves . What do you think Cindy Crawford would look like in a fun house mirror ? Uh , weird ? - Ugly . - And how would the most handsome man in the world look ? How would , say , PeterJennings look in a fun house mirror ? - Ugly . - And how do you look ... in this mirror ? Do you think that looks like a bad person ? An unworthy person ? I 'll tell you what I see . I see a nice smile . I see soulful brown eyes . I see good . Now , Rob , I want you to keep looking into this mirror ... until you see the same things that I do . There 's a meeting that I 'd like you to attend tonight . It 's every Monday , Wednesday and Friday . Now , you can talk to me anytime you want . But these people are the best . They can really help you . - I have to go . - You always hurry away . I appreciate it , and I want you to understand ... that I really am trying to do right . [ Stomach Growling Loudly ] [ Door Closes ] - Hey , Rob , you didn 't tell me you had a friend in the F.B.I. - What ? He 's upstairs . I told him all about that strange man in the maroon car , and he said he 'd look into it . Afternoon , Rob . Sir , may we speak with you ? Derwood Spinks has disappeared . His car is gone , along with some personal belongings . My partner saw Spinks in your neighborhood yesterday morning . At that time , you told Agent Mulder that you hadn 't seen Mr. Spinks . Is that correct ? I don 't even know him that well . If he was going to leave town , he wouldn 't come tell me about it . Who said he left town ? I don 't know . Isn 't that what you think happened ? No , no . Uh , personally , I think he 's dead . I can 't speak for my partner , but I think that whatever it was ... that killed Donald Pankow also got to Mr. Derwood Spinks . What do ... What do you mean , whatever it was ? Well , I 'll let you in on a little secret . We 've been able to keep it pretty quiet up until now , but Donald Pankow 's brain was missing from his skull . My partner was able to find something that was previously undetected . It was the tip of what could only be described ... as a tiny shark 's tooth embedded deep in the bone . I think we 're looking for some kind of genetic freak ... a carnivorous predator as yet unidentified . A monster , if you will . There 's no such thing . Well , don 't you believe it . This thing defnitely qualifes . It has a biological imperative to eat . I think it even ate that ground chuck you threw away . Yeah ? Why ? Because it can 't kill with impunity , and it knows it . It knows that the more it feeds on humans , the closer it gets to getting caught . But the hunger is always there , and it satisfies it anyway it can . I 'm-I 'm sorry , but this is like good cop , insane cop . Why are you telling me all of this ? I think you know why . Thank you , Mr. Roberts . We 'll contact you if we have any further questions . Watch out for that monster . [ Door Opens ] [ Woman ] Devil 's food , with the white sugar frosting . And it is , like , " Deliver me from evil . " [ Chuckling ] Come on in . Come on . So , I baked three dozen of these ... for my daughter 's school fund-raiser . And at 3 ; 00 in the morning the night before there they are , all three dozen of 'em , lined up and calling to me . - [ Stomach Growling Loudly ] - Well , you know , in the past , there would have been a good chance I would 've gone through every single last one of them . Small world , huh ? Is this your first time at a meeting ? - Yeah . - [ Applause ] Does anybody else have anything they want to share ? Do you feel up to introducing yourself ? Everybody 's really nice . - Anyone ? - Don 't be scared . It helped me . [ Applause ] Uh , hi . My name is Robert Roberts . People ... People call me Rob . [ All ] Hi , Rob ! L-I have an eating disorder . I 'm defnitely a meat eater , not a vegetarian . I 've always had these cravings ... my whole life . And just-just recently , the last month or so , they 've just become too powerful to resist . Tell us about it . I guess it 's the taste I respond to the most . Salty and ... juicy . Kind of buttery . - [ Groaning ] - The texture of it inside of your mouth ... You know , your teeth just sink into it ... like this juicy cloud . And it tastes so good . You know , you don 't even wanna swallow it . You just wanna work it around your taste buds ... until your eyes roll right back into your head . [ Heartbeat Pounding ] Do you remember when I first came here ? Anyway , it 's a real problem . [ Rob Laughing ] Wait . Your ex-husband did what ? He said I was too fat to ride in his sports car ... that I 'd just mess up the springs . So I sat on the hood and I bounced . And I didn 't stop until the police showed up . They sided with me . Hey , thank you , Sylvia . Good night , Rob . Good night , Sylvia . [ Stomach Growling Loudly ] I 'll be right there . [ Screaming ] [ Man ] What the hell is going on ? Oh , my God ! Call the police ! [ Woman ] Everything okay ? [ Police Radio Chattering ] Mr. Derwood Spinks , alive and well . You know what , folks ? Why don 't we go outside and talk about it there . I 'm confused , Rob . Was he helping you redecorate ? - I lied to you before . - About what ? Derwood was ... was coming from my place the morning you saw him . He said if I spoke to you , he 'd kill me . What didn 't he want you to tell us ? Last Friday night , he hung out while I was cleaning out the freezer . He told me to go home , said he 'd finish up . You know , I ... I didn 't know why the hell he was being so nice to me . But when I got home , I realized I had the key to the Dumpster . And when I drove back , I saw him cleaning up all this blood . You must have been very scared . I was , but you know , I should have told the truth from the start . Do you recognize this guy ? - No . - Hmm . He 's a private eye . Sylvia Jassie 's ex-husband ... hired him to spy on her . But now this Steve Kiziak is gone missing . He was last seen parked outside your apartment . You didn 't notice him ? No , l-I didn 't ... notice anything . Well , maybe we should check with Sylvia again . I don 't ... I don 't think she 's home . Ah , well , we 'll track her down . Don 't worry , Rob . It won 't be long now . [ Reinhart ] Oh , my God . Rob ? What happened ? It 's a long story . What do ... What do you want ? I , uh ... I was in the neighborhood , and I thought I 'd say hi . - Hi . - Rob , are you all right ? Did you do this ? No ! Derwood Spinks did this . You know , he 's the one who ... Like I said , it 's a long story . Where are you going ? To a friend 's house . I have to leave , actually , as in now . Are you sure you 're all right ? You 're not feeling ... Yes , absolutely . I 'm-I 'm fine , you know ? It 's just that when you came to see me yesterday , I sensed that there were things that you wanted to talk about , but couldn 't . [ Closes Drawer ] That was yesterday . Well , can we talk about them now ? Look , let me stop you right there , okay ? You don 't have to worry about me anymore . As of ... As of 10 : 38 a.m. , I am no longer employed by the Lucky Boy Corporation . - I quit . - Rob . I 'm here as a friend . Well , then , consider me cured . I had a breakthrough last night . - Did you attend the O.A. Meeting ? - Yeah . - How did it go ? - It was a complete and utter waste of my time . I 'm sorry you felt that way . So they 're a bunch of fat people . So what ? M-M-Maybe they , got , uh , what you would call a biological imperative ... to eat too much . Did you ever think of that ? Did you ? You know , maybe I 've got a biological imperative too . So why is that such a bad thing ? Like , the world 's gonna end ? That is biology . You can 't fight biology . You can 't . - Sounds like you 're saying you 're tired of feeling guilty . - Bingo . And I am sick and tired ... of pretending that I 'm something that I 'm not . You killed that man , didn 't you ? What did you just say ? That 's why you feel so guilty , isn 't it ? Can you tell me why you did it ? - Who have you been talking to ? - No one . I realized it after our last session . - You spoke to the F.B.I. , didn 't you ? - I haven 't spoken to anyone . And I won 't without your permission , but I am here ... - to ask you to turn yourself in . - [ Siren Wailing ] I want you to get the help that you need . [ Siren Continues ] - [ Car Doors Opening , Closing ] - You don 't know what the hell you 're talking about . Yes , I do , Rob . No , you don 't ! You said ... you don 't believe in monsters . Right ? How about ... now ? [ Gasps ] How about ... now ? Do you believe ... in monsters ? You poor man . What you must go through . - [ Door Bursts Open ] - [ Gasps ] - Oh , my God . - Step away , Rob . - Step away . - Dr. Reinhart , step away from him . - Don 't hurt him . - Rob , we tracked Sylvia down on the way to the landfll . You just can 't stop yourself , can you ? Get on the floor . Rob , get on the floor ! Rob . Be that good person I know you mean to be . [ Yelling ] [ Reinhart Screaming ] Why ? I can 't be something I 'm not . [ Child ] I made this !

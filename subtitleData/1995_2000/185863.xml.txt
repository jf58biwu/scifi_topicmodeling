 " George Unwin requests the pleasure ... " Unwin the millionaire ? The same . If it 's like his last party , there 'll be three topics of conversation . Money , howto make it and howto hold on to it . It 's very dull unless one 's income is in the seven-fiigure bracket . So why accept ? I was coerced into it . - I had a call from Lord Maxsted . - The chairman of British Banking ? Particularly asked me to be there . The second one was even more curious . Do you want to hear ? Hello , Steed . Gilbert Jarvis here . - I must talk to you . - lf it 's that urgent , I can easily ... No , don 't come here ! Will you be at Unwin 's party tomorrow ? - I 've been invited . - Good . I 'll see you there . Surely you can give me a hint what it 's about . I can 't explain now , but ... I 've just been murdered ! - Intriguing , isn 't it ? - Yes . Did you call him back ? He wouldn 't talk . Said he 'd explain it at Unwin 's party . I wonder how he 'll arrive . In a hearse ? . Steed there ? Yes . Who is it ? It 's Gilbert Jarvis . The murder victim . I 've just been murdered again ! Been murdered again ? What is all this ? are you there ? What 's wrong ? I 'll meet you at Unwin 's as we arranged . He 'll see me at Unwin 's ! Do you detect that heady aroma ? Roses ? The sweet , sickly smell of money . - The air 's heavy with it . - The place 's littered with millionaires . and awash with them . Do you think there 's a collective noun for millionaires ? - a " multi " of millionaires ? - a " tycoonery " ? I don 't see Jarvis . Lord Rathbone made his fiirst million before he was 21 . Easy to see how . Here 's Lord Maxsted . - So glad you could make it . - It was practically a summons . I don 't think you know Mrs. Peel . How do you do ? Must speak to you . Will you excuse us ? If we could fiind a quiet corner ... I see you brought the delicious Mrs. Peel along . You are Emma Peel . I 've heard so much about you . I 'm George Unwin . Hope you 're enjoying my shindig . Let me know if not , and I 'll change the whole decor . Or the house , or I 'll move it somewhere else . Paris ? Or Monte . Just let me know . Has Jarvis arrived ? - Is Gilbert Jarvis here ? - No. and he 's late , too . He 's a stickler for punctuality . " Time is money , " he says . - He 's right , too . - I 'd better call him . I won 't be a moment . Got to phone my banker . But I 'm his banker . Peanuts , my Lord ? Jarvis , is that you ? are you there ? Is that you ? What 's happened ? Something funny at Jarvis ' place . I 'm going to check . You hold the fort . I 'll call you . - You 're not going ? - I must . - We haven 't had our talk . - Talk to Mrs. Peel . She 's a sympathetic listener . She 's also extremely trustworthy . Shall we fiind a quiet corner ? Steed said I could trust you . Forgive me . But a banker , to reveal anything about his clients ... I 'm not taking notes . I 'll be brief and to the point . What would you say if a millionaire came to you and withdrew one million pounds ... - ... in cash ? - I 'd say blackmail . If the man packed and left the country what would you say ? I 'd say fear . He was running away from something . - Has this happened ? - Three times , and it 's happening again . One of my oldest customers called me . Same request. a million in cash to be available immediately . Who was this customer ? Gilbert Jarvis . It can 't be coincidence . The pattern 's always identical . One million in cash . No one deals in cash when those fiigures are involved . Unless it 's a payoff of some kind . - You haven 't got a drink ! - Thank you . - Call for you . - Thank you . Jarvis is dead . How did it happen ? He was really murdered this time . I see . I 'll see you later . - You say Jarvis asked for a million . - Yes . - He won 't be collecting it . - Why not ? He 's just been murdered . - Who 'd want to murder him ? - How did it happen ? I 'm sorry . That 's all I know . Excuse me . . No visitors . Good evening ! I 'd like to see Mr. Rathbone . No visitors . If you 'd like to tell him that Mrs. Peel ... He 's not seeing anybody . Those are his orders . Get on , Quint . - Who is it ? - Chalmers , sir . Found someone snooping around . Found someone ? - Young lady , sir . - You ? You were at the party . That 's right . I 'd like to speak to you . I 'm not seeing anyone . It concerns a million pounds . In cash . all right , Chalmers but stay right outside the door . I like to feel secure . I 'm fair game for burglars . It 'd take an army of burglars to break in here . State your business . Supposing I was to say I was a journalist . a series of articles entitled Howto Become a Millionaire . Journalist ? Not only do you break into my house , but you use a dishonest trick to ... You know all about dishonesty , don 't you ? - They were there to take . - But not to take away . Naughty . What about Jarvis ? Well , what about him ? - You know him well ? - No , not intimately . I met him a couple of times at Unwin 's . and yet you seemed so shocked when you heard he 'd been murdered . That 's only natural . Murder is a shocking affair . You 're a thrifty man . and proud of it . Breeds moral character . and dust . Why are you so frightened ? Frightened ? Me ? You shut yourself off behind guard dogs armed men , an array of locks . I value my seclusion ! No , you 're frightened . Look at you now . You 're edgy . I don 't like people ! and you 're perspiring . It 's hot in here . Then why not open a window ? Shall we do that ? Open a window and let the air in . Nothing frightens me ! Nothing ! Who are you ? How did you get in ? Why ? Did you check the grounds ? Guards posted ? Three front , three back . The rest are patrolling . If you meet any trouble , if you see anybody , shoot to kill ! Do you understand ? Shoot to kill ! You have just been murdered again . For the fourth time , too . - Who are you ? - a well-wisher . Intensely concerned for your welfare . Four times is the limit . The next time , it 'll be for real . What do you want ? Why do you keep ... Now , I think we talk business . Don 't you ? Rathbone 's place is a fortress . Guards . Barred windows . - Bolts on the door ? - Yes . Jarvis had them , too . Didn 't do him much good . But he knew he was in danger . Now , Rathbone ... Rathbone is scared . There 's no doubt about that . But why ? It 's happening to Rathbone now . Wants me to sell his government stock . Now ? It 's the worst time to sell . I know , and so does he . But he wants the money now . - How much ? - a million . - In cash ? - It 's to be at the bank by midday . Is he collecting it personally ? I couldn 't reason with him . Can 't you delay handing it over ? It 's his money . If he wants it , I must hand it over . Certainly , you must . Come in , Mrs. Peel . I 'm safely ensconced in Lord Maxsted 's offiice . We have the loot here , all spread out waiting for Rathbone . Would it all fiit into a black , medium-sized suitcase ? Yes , why ? Because that 's what Rathbone 's carrying . Very inconsiderate of him . Lord Maxsted was about to introduce me to a very old and rare sherry . Rathbone 's here . Looking very jumpy , too . Wouldn 't you ? Suppose so . The prospect of wandering around with a million in cash is not calculated to soothe the nerves . He 's leaving . If you want me , I 'll be with Unwin . If the pattern flits , he 's likely to be the next candidate . I 'm on my way . Good luck . Rathbone 's arrived . He 's heading for the bridge now . Rathbone was followed by a woman . Tall , slim , auburn-haired . Never mind her looks ! Deal with her quickly ! . Did you manage to pin Mr. Unwin down ? He was in more of an upright position when I pinned him . against a wall . I damaged his orchids . Excellent . He must be near cracking point . I think we should step up the treatment . Immediately . Right . Just one word . . - are you all right ? - Of course , I 'm all right . - What 's wrong with using the front door ? - What 's going on ? I could ask you the same thing . Breaking my windows . There was a flight in here ... - I saw it . - Fight ? I just tripped down the stairs and knocked the lamp . That 's not good enough . I saw you stabbed right through the chest ! I hope you 're not starting to lose your marbles . There were two men in here ! Must be the light from that lamp . You know , it casts funny shadows . I don 't want to seem inhospitable , but I am feeling very tired . and frightened . are you frightened , too ? I 've known you a long time . If you 're in any trouble ... If I did have any trouble , I 'd know howto deal with it , right ? I 'd have thought so . Let 's leave it at that then . Shall we ? We must get together sometime soon . Perhaps next month when I 'm not quite so busy . Have a lot of fun , yes ? - Don 't forget , you know my number . - I won 't . You see , there 's no escape . You may think you 're invulnerable , but we can always get to you . What do you want ? Before we go into that , I suggest you relax . Spot of television might help . I hear there 's a good program on Channel B. It 'll be on the air at 10 : 00 . What do you want ? - Why don 't you tune in and fiind out ? - Who are you ? Channel B. 10 : 00 . You 'll be seeing me then . Bridge Farm . That was the place . It 's not marked here . Very bleak and deserted . The ideal place for a payoff . Yes , the bridge is here . Rathbone just dropped it over the side ? Yes . He walked over and ... For him to chuck a million in the river , he must 've had a good reason . a sort of high-class protection racket with a clientele of millionaires ? When you have everything money can buy , life becomes more precious . Scare them enough , they 're bound to pay off . and keep silent . - I doubt if any of them will talk . - Rathbone certainly won 't . Once he 's paid , he won 't risk ending up like Jarvis . There 's still Unwin . are you sure he was threatened ? I saw him being attacked ! I didn 't imagine it . He hasn 't approached Maxsted . I think it 's just a matter of time . Good evening . Welcome to Channel B. and a particularly warm welcome to Mr. George Unwin . Do answer it . That 's me ringing you . Can you hear me ? Splendid . Sit down . are we viewing comfortably ? - Yes . - Good . Then I 'll begin . First , let me introduce myself . The name is Needle . No quips , please . I 've heard them all before . although , I do admit , I 'm a little diffiicult to fiind . It 's extremely unwise to try . Someone once said that a man should use his natural-born talents to the full . Do you agree ? I 'm so glad ! Because you see , I 'm a natural-born parasite . Will you get to the point ? The point ? In the last 24 hours , you 've been murdered four times . On any one of those occasions , it could 've actually happened . I think you 'll agree , it would have been very unfortunate . after all , dying is a very serious business . It 's so permanent ! Which brings us to the commercial . - The price ? - a high one . One which you can well afford . In cash . The place ... The money will be delivered in ... Don 't worry . We 'll supply you with one . Don 't tell me . Unwin rang Maxsted . and Maxsted rang me . He 's asked for his million . - In cash ? - On the nail . - Collected when ? - Unwin didn 't say . He 'll call back . When he does , I hope Maxsted ... Will be calling you . When ? I see . Thanks for calling . He 's collected the money ? He 's asked Maxsted to deliver it to his house . There 's still time . You have a plan ? That 's right . Ready ? It 's a combined operation . Open house today , I see . Forgive me , but I have an urgent appointment . Carry on ! Don 't let me get in your way . What 's this ? Off on a shopping spree ? It 's a private transaction . Isn 't your cheque enough ? My dealings are my own concern . I disagree . This deal is everyone 's . I know what 's going on . You 're being threatened , aren 't you ? If I am , that 's my affair . - I can take care of myself . - Then why are you paying ? I can do what I like with my money . They 'll be back . Look , I told you . I can take care of this myself and I don 't need your help . Now just go and promise me you 'll stay out of this . all right , I 'll go . But for the rest ... Unwin won 't talk . He 's going his own way . Has he left ? Not yet . But when he does , I won 't be far behind . Quite a catch ! What do you use for bait ? . Up you get ! Take me to your leader or lead me to your taker . You 've obeyed your instructions to a tee . Well done . You followed me ? Not quite . What 's that ? Your million . Which I hope to retrieve very soon . If you do , you 'd better hurry . - Why ? - I said I 'd handle this alone . There 's a bomb in that case . It 's due to go off in 15 minutes . I dropped it here . Who cares where the case is as long as it doesn 't explode before arriving ? Mrs. Peel 's car was back there ... You mean she ... I 'm sorry . I should have told you . But I had been murdered four times . If anything happens to Mrs. Peel , there 'll be a fiifth . Hold it . a word in your ear . Your silence is requested . No sign of anything . We 've not much time . It 's in that direction . " E.P. " Mrs. Emma Peel ! and your name ? Needle . Nathaniel Needle . In a haystack . a little joke of mine . I thought I was impossible to fiind . How did you manage it ? I don 't think I heard your reply . That 's not surprising . I didn 't answer . Tall , slim , auburn-haired . Your description was passed to one of my men before you killed him . Pity . He was a good man . Get that case out of sight ! Haven 't much time . It 's due to go off at 3 : 00 . Let 's try that caravan . That 's quite a haul . Where are you heading ? The Bahamas ? South america ? The moon ? Safe deposit and then back again for more . Soon , I 'll be the richest man in the world and the most powerful . Keep an eye on those two . But now , we must fiind a way of dealing with Mrs. Peel . There 's no one there . - Where 's the case ? - In the van . But there 's a bomb in that case . Don 't be silly . I 've been carrying it around ... Bang goes the million . and 10,000 ! How much is that ? 920,000 . Right . 10,000 . I didn 't know you had so much money . Neither did I. If I didn 't know you better I 'd say you 'd been very thrifty . Forgetful . Save a little each week , soon amounts up ! Certainly does . Is it wise to leave all this cash lying around ? You 're quite right . Soon as it 's counted , I 'll pop down to the bank . Totter . With this little lot , you 'll be tottering down to the bank . I see what you mean . Maybe I could use an armoured car . Or two . I hope this isn 't going to change your mode of living . This vast wealth . Of course not ! I still retain the old values . 9,999 ? - It can 't be ! - Impossible . You 're one short of a million ! There 's no status without it ! Who ever heard of a 999,999-aire ? Wait a minute . There . Success ! I made it ! You are now a self-made , fully fledged , half-penny millionaire .

 I would like a double-dip vanilla with granola sprinkles , please . - Truck ain 't open . - Uh , I have cash money . It 's 7 : 30 in the freakin ' morning . Why don 't you try the Waffle House ? Considering the iron , calcium and lactose in the ice cream ... the carbohydrate value of the cone and the fiber content of the granola ... one could , in reality , receive more nutritious ingredients in one Tasty Surprise ... than in an entire bacon and egg breakfast . - Are you some kind of nut ? - No . I just like ice cream . Yeah . - Taxi ! - [ Man ] I don 't understand . The police looked through my daughter 's room once already . - What did you say your name was ? - Waxman . Detective Jarod Waxman . The other officer said a teenager missing less than 48 hours ... wasn 't gonna be a high priority case . We reconsidered the situation . Was there anything out ofordinary going on ... in your daughter 's life before she disappeared ? Something bothering her ? [ Man ] My wife passed away three years ago . - Cancer . - I 'm sorry . And it 's been hard for me , but not like it 's been for Jesse . She just barely turned 15 . She was at an age where a girl really needs her mother . And I guess I just didn 't have the answers that she needed . Maybe she went away with a friend , someone from school ? Jesse 's shy . She doesn 't have much of a social life . I don 't know . It 's like she just vanished into thin air . She seemed to have a special interest in angels . Yeah . When her mother passed away ... Jesse started collecting them , reading books about them . That one 's her favorite . - Have you seen this before ? - No , never . " Gates of Hell . " That 's Jesse 's handwriting . You 've got to help me . My daughter 's life is in your hands , Detective . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . - [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . - [ Jarod ] Life 's a gift .. - You a doctor ? - I am today . A man with no face ? It reminds me of a young man I recently hired ... to help restore a broken-down old wax museum . - Mr. Kleinman , I didn 't even hear you come in . - [ Chuckling ] Oh , a gift for a friend ? More like ... a message . Ah . I brought you a snack . - Ooh , I hope it 's ice cream . - Better . A delicacy . Alcatraz oysters . These little beauties you can find only in San Francisco Bay . Go ahead . Eat . Enjoy . Yeah . - Eh ? - Mmm . - They 're very good . - [ Chuckling ] [ Sniffs ] You know what ? This just might do the trick . You are a very strange young man , Jarod . Not half as strange as the people I 'm sending this to . Jarod , are you sure you wouldn 't want to stay upstairs ? Actually , I spend a lot of time alone . It 's sort of nice to have the company . - Ah . - Mr . Kleinman , have you ever seen anything like this before ? [ Gasps ] My God ! Where did you get this ? A man I know is searching for his daughter . - You have seen it . - Yeah . - I have seen it . - You 're a Holocaust survivor . Members of the S.S. wore similar symbols ... on their uniforms . - Devils . Demons . - This man - He 's worried for his daughter 's safety . Oh , he should be . He should be scared to death . # [ Techno , Man Singing , Indistinct ] # [ Man Screaming ] # [ Singing Resumes ] Didn 't your mother ever tell you it 's rude to stare ? I hardly knew my mother . - See something you like ? - I 'm confused . - Doesn 't all that ... hurt ? - That 's the idea , slick . So you enjoy ... self-inflicted pain ? You 're screwin ' with my head , right ? Actually , I 'm looking for someone . A young man . A magician . Throw a rock , baby cakes . Yeah , I 've seen Hawk handing these out to a select few . He 's holding court in the back room . - You can 't miss him . - Thank you . And when you 're finished playing games with the bird man , come back . - I 'll show you a real magic show . - That would be enjoyable . Thank you . # [ Screaming ] # [ Singing Resumes ] Most people can 't comprehend the very world they inhabit . They exist , but they don 't experience . They look , but they never see . I believe that they 're portals - windows to the body , the mind and the spirit . Given the perfect exchange of energies , these windows can be opened . Pass beyond . I look at you . I look into you ... and I see tremendous sorrow , emptiness . I want you to think about what was taken from you . I magine in your mind 's eye the cause of your suffering . - I - I don 't - - Shh . Trust me . I want you to think about the object of your pain . Can you see it ? Yes . I offer you this gift ... with all my love . [ Gasps ] Oh , my God ! - How could you - - Who is Clare ? Sh-She 's my - my twin sister . [ Murmuring ] - And where is she ? - She was killed ... in a car accident when we were two . [ Sobbing ] But how could you know that ? Simple . Your heart told me . Tell us again about the Angel 's Flight . What 's Angel 's Flight ? It was a dream the great Houdini had repeatedly throughout his life . Or nightmares , some believe . Houdini felt , given the power of angels , he could break free ... from the boundaries ofEarth and soaring the heavens like a god . But , unfortunately , he wasn 't . And when he died , his dream died with him . Hawk says the Angel 's Flight is attainable . Close enough to touch . I suggest we assemble again at midnight for a reading session . Go with the angels . - [ Girl ] This is too heavy for me . - [ Boy ] This guy is awesome . - They seem to be very ... loyal . - I offer them something they need . - Something their worlds have denied them . - # [ Techno , Woman Singing ] - Magic . - Love . My name is Jarod . I hear you have a great gift - the ability to touch people . - And you desire this gift . - I wish to learn from the best . And why should I open myself to a stranger ? # [ Continues ] [ Blowing ] The perfect exchange of energy . Kessler will show you the way . # [ Continues ] - Midnight . - You don 't seem to share Hawk 's belief in the power of angels . - Excuse me ? - When the subject of Angel 's Flight came up ... you seemed rather uncomfortable . - # [ Continues ] - Midnight . Where are you , fallen angel ? Where are you ? Don 't even talk to me unless it 's good news . Broots ? You 're not gonna be happy . It 's not good news . - Any sign of Jarod ? - It 's like he vanished into a black hole . - Kind of like your personal life ? - Tell me about it . - [ Sydney ] That 's odd , isn 't it ? - [ Miss Parker ] What , the girl ? Cigar . Lyle doesn 't smoke . Oh , yeah , that 's a gift . Jerry , the guy with the glass eye who works down in Transportation - well , he told me that Mr. Lyle is expecting ... some Centre hotshot from the West Coast . - [ Miss Parker ] Did marble-eyed Jerry give you a name ? - Not that I can remember . Hmm . That makes him about as worthless as this shirt then , doesn 't it ? - What , did Don Ho have a garage sale ? - Don who ? The box . What 's in it ? Oh , yeah . Miss Parker , this box is for you . Well , that 's something you don 't see every day . - " Beware of strangers bearing gifts . " - I bet it 's from Jarod . - Gee , you think ? - Maybe he 's talkin ' about Lyle . Uh-uh . Cigars and champagne ? Maybe . What are you up to now , Jarod ? What are you up to now , Jarod ? [ doorknob Rattling ] [ Hawk ] Welcome , my friends , to the midnight session . Let us begin . Please stand . Common , I know . Read the date on this coin . - 1994 . - 1994 . That has special meaning for you , doesn 't it ? - Yes . - Why ? Because that 's the year my mother died . Turn the coin over . Oh ! She-She used to call me her Puppy . Yes . She 's with you . [ Sobbing ] [ Whispering ] She 'll always be with you . Thank you . [ Applause ] I see you found your way . - I wasn 't sure which way to go . - Obviously not that way . Tight security . Protecting magic secrets . Hawk likes to keep his personal life ... personal . I suggest you join the others . The reading 's already started . - Can I ask you something ? - If I said no , would you walk away ? Probably not . - Look familiar ? - Where did you get that ? I like to keep my personal life ... personal . You don 't want to miss the session . Of course not . - [ Hawk ] Your name ? - Uh , Scott . Stand up , Scott . It 's all right . I won 't bite . [ People Chuckling ] You can put that down . - You 're new here . - Yes . - You 're nervous . - [ Chuckles ] A little bit . - You 're also bleeding . - Bleeding ? Inside . You were betrayed . Hurt by someone you trusted , someone you loved . - I don 't know what you 're talking about . - Yes , you do . It 's all right . It 's all right . - We love you . - [ People , Softly ] We love you . [ Gasps ] You couldn 't believe it when it started . You wanted to scream , but you were afraid . - Confused . - Please don 't . [ Hawk ] You were so young , vulnerable . It was like a nightmare the way he came at you . So much anger . I can 't do this . You thought if you closed your eyes , it would stop . But it didn 't stop , did it , Scott ? It got more violent and angry . No . No . [ Hawk ] You were afraid to tellanyone . Afraid to say the name , terrified that no one would believe you . I was afraid . [ Sobbing ] You were only a boy , and he was so powerful , so terrifying . [ Scott ] I wanted him to stop hitting me . I wanted to say his name . I know you did . And now you can . Now you can say it for the entire world to hear . - I can 't . - Say it . - I can 't . - Say it , Scott ! Say it and end the nightmare forever ! I can 't ! [ Sobbing Continues ] I can 't . It 's all right . I 'll say it for you . - [ People Gasping ] - It was your father . It was your father who beat you , Scott . I never wanted it to happen . I know you didn 't , Scott . I know you didn 't . You don 't have to be afraid anymore . It 's okay , Scott . You should try that on me . - Maybe I will . - You think you helped him ? Everyone has secrets , demons they keep hidden . And sometimes , if you don 't stop them ... they eat you alive a piece at a time . What about you , Jarod ? What kind of demons are you hiding inside ? That 's all for tonight . Mr. Kessler will collect your offerings . - Another rush delivery from Jarod ? - Yeah , number three . Great . Now your boy 's yankin' my crank on an hourly basis . Jarod never plays these games without substantial motivation . It 's a head made of Sterno . - What is it this time ? - Wow ! Another giant leap into the Twilight Zone . You were saying something about motivation ? Substance , Parker . And there 's another note . " See no evil . " In the box with the ears , the note was , " Hear no evil . " Anything else on the identity of Lyle 's mystery arrival ? Nothing on the grapevine . Well , at least we have Mr. Potato Head . Cool . [ Beeps ] I finally found you , Jessica . Kill the son of a bitch . I was excited to get your call , even if it was a bit cryptic . - Found something out about Jessica ? - I 'm still working on the case . Mr. Bracken , you told me that your wife ... passed away from an illness . - That 's right . - That 's not what really happened , is it ? I wanna help you find your daughter , but we 're running out oftime . If I 'm going to help you , you have to tell me the truth . Okay . Sarah was ... vibrant . Shewas so full of life . Then she got sick . All that life just slowly drained out ofher . She tried to take the treatment , but ... it was too late . I don 't know why she went out on that roof . I don 't know ... what she was thinking when she jumped . The police found her body in the alley the next morning . She was still clutching her angel pendant in her hand . And that 's how Jesse became obsessed with angels . Yeah . I 'm sorry . I should have told you the truth . I just , uh , didn 't think that it - Find my little girl , Detective , please . She 's all I have left . [ Broots ] Speak no evil . - Anybody recognize him ? - He kinda looks like Gilligan . - Gilligan ? - Yeah . You know , the Skipper and the Professor and Mary Ann and-and Ginger . You grew up in a trailer park , didn 'tyou ? No , I did not . It was a mobile home . It 's obvious Jarod is trying to keep us busy chasing Mr. No Name 's identity ... while he skips along free as he pleases . - The question is , why all the effort ? - What about the notes ? - Jokes without punch lines . - Maybe a warning . - What is that ? - It looks like a-a water stain . [ Sniffs ] Ew ! - Smells like low tide . - [ Sniffs ] Wow ! They all smell the same . Maybe Jarod 's just dropping breadcrumbs . - Have these cards analyzed . - Okay . Who are you , pal ? " A History of Fallen Angels . " Fallen ... angels . Hawk says the Angel 's Flight is attainable . Close enough to touch . [ Echoing ] I don 't know why she went out on that roof . I don 't know ... what she was thinking when she jumped . [ Squeaking ] Jessica . - [ Gun Cocks ] - I hoped you were smarter . Why couldn 't you just walk away and let this thing finish ? The same reason that you couldn 't sit at that table with Hawk ... and talk about Angel 's Flight . He did this , didn 't he ? What happened ? Jesse Bracken didn 't have enough to offer ? Or she found the computer files that Hawk keeps on the others ? The wealthy , disenfranchised , young people ... that were recruited off the streets by you . That 's the game , isn 't it ? Dazzle them with magic ... and then take them for every penny you can . I told Hawk that we should just cut and run ... but it was never only about the money for him . Angel 's Flight was just the last act of the play . I swear , sometimes , the guy really thinks he 's gonna fly . - What happened to her ? - Hawk flipped out a couple of days ago ... and Jesse overheard us talkin ' about the scam . I just thought he was gonna talk to her . - I never thought he 'd kill her . - He didn 't . - What ? - She 's still alive . - Give me the gun and help me get her out of here . - No . Hawk - If you let her die , there is no magic in the world that 's going to save you . - Now give me the gun . - All she wanted ... was somebody to care about her , somebody to watch over her . Somebody did . Now give me the gun . # [ Man Singing ] # [ Continues ] Miss Parker , not only has Jarod topped off Mr. Potato Head with a nice hairpiece ... I just found out that the stains on the cards were made by oysters . - [ Sydney ] Oysters ? - Mm-hmm . What are you saying ? Jarod was a sloppy eater ? The residue was left by a very specific shellfish ... found only in the San Francisco Bay . I think Jarod wanted us to find him . San Francisco is a big city . Well , I started thinking about the head Jarod left ... so I scraped some of the wax , and I had it analyzed . It is used almost exclusively for the construction of human replication . - Wax museum . - [ Broots ] Touche , Syd . So I called the Frisco area and found one defunct wax museum . And when I called , this is what I got . [ Jarod ] Hello , Sydney , Broots , and as always , Miss Parker . I assume since you 're listening to this recording ... you figured out my current location . I realize things got a little fishy along the way ... but you realize timing is everything ... in the " run for your life " business . I won 't keep you longer than necessary . I realize you have a plane to catch . I just ask two things : First , bring along the wax head . I think you 'll find it enlightening . And second , don 't forget to buckle your seat belts . Happy landings . - Good work , Broots . - Thanks , Sydney . Let 's not polish each other 's doorknobs quite yet . - Get the jet fired up . We 're going to California . - Yes , ma 'am . - Broots ? - Yes , ma 'am ? - Don 't wear that shirt . It makes me nauseous . - Yes , ma 'am . It does . [ Boat Horn Blaring ] - I have told you . He is gone . - Sweep it . - Yes , Miss Parker . - Was that a gun ? Who are you people ? You were saying that Jarod helped you to remodel the museum . [ Mr. Kleinman ] An artist he is , sent here by the angels . - So I see . - [ Mr. Kleinman ] He redesigned the movie star exhibit ... the presidential study and my rose robe . And he even added a new display . - Jarod calls it ... Centre of Shame . - Show me . I have no idea what it is supposed to mean ... but something tells me you will . Hey , it 's us ! [ Chuckling ] Incredibly life like . [ Miss Parker ] It just gets weirder and weirder . [ Broots ] Uh-oh . This can 't be good . [ Echoing Laughter ] - I 'll be damned ! - [ Broots ] We just witnessed our own execution . - Let 's get out of here . - [ Laughter Continues ] [ Hawk ] Welcome to the Angel 's Flight . As I look at you all tonight ... I 'm filled with divine energy . The belief in the possibility of the impossible . That faith is what separates the leaders from the followers ... the enlightened from the blind , the gods ... from the mortals . With your strength and spirit , all things are possible . [ Jarod ] Looking for your safety line , Hawk ? - Jarod . - You seem surprised to see me . I saw the shirt . Kessler shot you . Ah-ah-ah . The first rule of Magic : Never believe what you see . Hawk , what 's going on ? It seems our friend Hawk here isn 't exactly the magic man he pretends to be . You want to tell them ? Or should I ? - Go to hell . - You first . - What 's that ? - It 's you . And you . And you . It 's all of you . Go ahead . Take a look . Hawk had a personal file on each and every one of you . He knew who you were , who you are , where you 're from ... how much you had to ... offer . He knew your deepest fears , your darkest secrets . He knew you better than you knew yourselves . And in return for his amazing insights , you gave him whatever you had of value . And why not ? He saw into your souls , right ? - Why ? - Money . Unfortunately , not all of you were so easily led . That 's why you killed Jesse Bracken . She stumbled onto your computer room , discovered your little scam . And that 's it . She had to go . So you dragged her up here and you threw her off the roof . - You can 't prove anything . - Can 't I ? Next time you toss someone off a building ... you 'd better make damn sure you clean up after yourself . So , you still think ... that you 're worthy to fly with the angels , Hawk ? Or is this just a pathetic curtain call ofa half-baked magic show ? What are you waiting for ? Divine intervention ? [ Hawk ] My final gift to you . Son of a bitch ! You killed him ! [ Jarod ] Ah-ah-ah . Remember what I told you ? The first rule of magic : Never believe what you see . I hate to say it , but Jarod has me stumped this time . There must be something that we 're not seeing . [ Broots ] Eyes , nose , ears , mouth . It all seems to be there . See no evil , hear no evil , speak no evil . I don 't know what it means , but it gives me a bad feeling . - Good . You 're all still here . - Where else ? As you may or may not know , the Triumvirate has decided ... to become more hands-on in the pursuit ofJarod . And in an effort to protect the integrity oftheir pursuit ... an element has been added to act as a safeguard ... or a safety net , if you will . Why don 't you just say it ? A new player . You can think of him as a one-man Internal Affairs Division . Mr. Cox . - Cox ? - It 's with an " X. " [ Chuckles ] I hope we get to know each other better in the coming days . - No doubt . - I hate to be rude ... but we really have to leave if we 're gonna make that next appointment . That answers that . Brings us to a bigger question . Who is Mr. Cox ? Jarod already answered that . He 's the Grim Reaper . - Hi . - Hey , Detective Waxman . I was hoping we 'd see you again . I was on my way out of town , and I thought I would stop by and say good-bye . - You look good . - The doctor said it 's a miracle she wasn 't killed . My dad says that you saved my life . I don 't know how to thank you . Seeing you sitting there smiling is thanks enough . They said the man that did this confessed to running the scam all over the country . It 's good to know he won 't be hurting anybody else 's children . Detective , I know it 's not the same as saving your life ... but I thought maybe you 'd like to have this . It helped keep me safe . I hope it 'll do the same for you . I 'll keep it close . Thank you . - Bye . - Bye .

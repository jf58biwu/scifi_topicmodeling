 ( LOUD HISSING ) Uh ... ( HOLLOW ECHOING ) ( RUMBLING ) ( BREATHING UNEVENLY ) ( UNEARTHLY WHOOPING SOUNDS ) ( ECHOING CLANG ) ( GROANS ) Hey . Hey . ( UNEARTHLY WHOOPING NOISES ) ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) Ah ! ( SCREAMING ) I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . It 's all right . I 'm not gonna hurt you . ( YELLING ) What do you want ? ( WHISPERING ) I thought you were ... What ? I don 't know . ( LOW MECHANICAL HUM ) ( RUMBLING ) LEAVEN : Help ! Help ! Help ! Stop ! What ? What ? ( WHISPERING ) It 's okay . Come here . ( GRUNTS ) It 's okay . Calm down . Everything 's gonna be fine . What was in there ? Just give me a minute to figure things out . Why were you afraid of that room ? Give me a minute , I said ! ( LOUD SLIDING ) How many people are in this thing ? Listen ! We can 't go climbing around in here . - Why not ? - ( DOOR SLIDES SHUT ) ( WHISPERING ) There 's traps . What do you mean , traps ? Booby traps . I looked in a room down there and something almost cut my head off . ( GASPING FEARFULLY ) HOLLOWAY : Holy cats ! Holy , holy cats . You all right ? Mister . Worth . Don 't worry . I hit my head . Let me take a look at that . It 's okay . I 'm a doctor . Doesn 't look bad . ( GRUNTS ) What the hell are you doing ? Hey , old man , did you hear what I said ? ( DOOR SLIDES SHUT ) Motion detectors integrated into the walls . Tough to spot . LEAVEN : Oh , God . ( SOBBING ) Oh , God , Oh , God ! Wait a second . Let 's all just relax for a minute . Does anybody remember how they got here ? Perogies ! I was eating dinner . Perogies . Cheese and potato . I ran out of sour cream , and then I went to the fridge , and then ... I don 't know . You ? Leaven ? I ... I just went to bed , and ... What about you ? I just woke up here . Middle of the night . It 's like Chile . They always come in the middle of the night . Who ? HOLLOWAY : Only the government could build something this ugly . QUENTIN : Oh , it ain 't government . HOLLOWAY : Then What is it ? I don 't know . - ( RUMBLING ) - Aliens . Please . We 're spooked enough as it is . Let 's ... Let 's rule out aliens for now and concentrate on what we know . My mom 's gonna freak . Rennes ? I just won 't be there . They 'll freak . What do you think , Rennes ? We won 't solve jack shit sitting still . I 'm moving in a straight line till I get to the end . All right . I tend to agree . LEAVEN : Shouldn 't we wait here ? For what ? To see if anybody comes . No one 's gonna come . Look . There 's a way in here , so there 's gotta be a way out . We can avoid the traps using the boot . Holloway , is it ? What do you think ? Look for an exit ? Okay . What about you ? It can 't be that simple . RENNES : It won 't be that simple . Look around . Take a good , long look-see . 'Cause I got a feeling it 's looking at us . I just want to wake up . Leaven . We can do this . We just have to stay calm and work together as a team . ( TWITCHES ) There 's gonna be a lot of people looking for us on the outside . I 'm a cop . All right ? - You 're a cop ? - Yeah . I 'm gonna get you outta here . I promise . You gotta be with me on this one . Okay . Okay . ( DOOR SLIDES OPEN ) Boot it . Clean . ( DOOR SLIDING OPEN ) ( RUMBLING ) ( RATTLING ) HOLLOWAY : That one sounded closer . It 's mechanical . Seems to come at regular intervals . QUENTIN : Maybe it 's the ventilation system . RENNES : No vents . HOLLOWAY : No kidding . I 'm boiling . What is it ? Serial numbers ? HOLLOWAY : Room numbers . They 're different in each room . Oh , great . Well , there 's only 566 million , 400,000 odd rooms in this thing . Well , there better not be . We have about three days without food and water before we 're too weak to move . Well , they have to feed us , don 't they ? Holloway . HOLLOWAY : Oh , we have heat , stress , physical exertion , I.E. , dehydration , headaches , dizziness , disorientation , confused mental processes . The body eventually begins to break down its own tissue . Suck on it . Keeps the saliva flowing . ( SNIFFING ) What ? The air seems dry in there . HOLLOWAY : Trapped ? Molecular chemical sensor . Why the hell didn 't the boot set it off ? The boot 's not alive . Detects hydrogen sulphide excreted from the skin . How is it you know so much about sensors , Rennes ? ( DOOR SLIDES SHUT ) " Renn . " Not " Renns . " It 's French . Fine . You 're French . I 'm asking you how ... Rennes . Sensor expert . About the right age . I don 't believe it . ( CHUCKLING ) This guy 's the Wren . The what ? He 's the Wren . The bird of Attica . - Flew the coop on six major prisons . - Seven . HOLLOWAY : You 're kidding , right ? You can get us out . Maybe . An escape artist . Yeah . I 'm Harry fucking Houdini . The only reason I dragged you this far is ' cause I need your boots . If you don 't smarten up , I 'm gone like that . No more talking . No more guessing . Don 't even think about nothing that 's not right in front of ya . That 's the real challenge . You gotta save yourselves from yourselves . ( CLICKS ) Merde . ( SCREAMING ) Get him out . ( MUFFLED SCREAMING ) ( ALL SCREAMING ) ( SOBBING ) Oh , my God . ( SOBBING ) QUENTIN : So . It was electro-chemical or whatever , right ? And he missed it . The Wren . That 's great . That 's fucking great . All right . It 's time to reassess this place . I 've been over it again and again . Why would they throw innocent people in here ? Are we being punished ? I 've never done anything to deserve this . Forget about all that ! You can 't see the big picture from in here , so don 't try . Keep your head down . Keep it simple . Just look at what 's in front of you . That 's what he said . Start with us . We got an escape artist and a cop . There 's gotta be a reason for that . You 're a doctor , Holloway . That gives you a function , a reason , right ? No . It just makes me go , " Why me and not one of the other 10 million doctors out there ? " ( SIGHS ) Leaven . What are you ? Nothing . I just go to school . I hang out with my friends . What else ? There is nothing else . My parents are these people . I live with them . I 'm boring . I think we have to ask the big questions . What does it want ? What is it thinking ? " One down , four to go . " ( LOW RUMBLING ) Why don 't you tell us what your purpose is , Worth ? Often wondered that myself . ( SIGHS ) I 'm just a guy . I work in an office building doing office building stuff . I wasn 't exactly bursting with joie de vivre before I got here . Life just sucks in general . Oh , I can 't stand that attitude . 'Cause he 's right . What 's your purpose , Quentin ? Kids . Three of them . I haven 't made my peace yet . I 'm getting ' outta here no matter what . That 's where my strength comes from . You people find yours wherever you got it . Christ 's sake , Worth , what do you live for ? Don 't you have a wife or a girlfriend or something ? Nope . I got a pretty fine collection of pornography . Oh , nice . Nice . I haven 't got anybody , either , but I 'm not giving up . I am pissed off . They came into our homes . They stripped us bare ! They took my rings ! They took ... Oh , my amethyst . ( RUMBLING ) I want to know who 's responsible . QUENTIN : Leaven ? Your glasses . You don 't need them ? They 're for reading . Well , they took off her jewellery , but they must 've put these on you . If nothing 's random , why are they here ? QUENTIN : Leaven . What do you do in school ? Math . HOLLOWAY : What can they mean ? Shh . 149 . Prime numbers . I can 't believe I didn 't see it before . QUENTIN : See what ? It seems like if any of these numbers are a prime , then the room is trapped . Okay . Um ... 645 . ( WHISPERING ) 645 ... That 's not prime . 372 . No . 649 . Right . Eleven times 59 . It 's not prime , either . So that room is safe . Wait , wait , wait . How can you make that assumption based on one prime number trap ? I 'm not . The incinerator thing was prime , 083 . The molecular chemical thingy had 137 . The acid room had 149 . You remember all that in your head ? I have a facility for it . Leaven , you beautiful brain . Boot it . Okay . Outta the way . LEAVEN : Brains before beauty . Safe ! Safe . ( CHUCKLING ) Prime numbers ! Prime numbers ! ECHO : Prime numbers ! ECHO : Prime numbers ! LEAVEN : Oh . How long have we been in here ? QUENTIN : Nine or 10 hours . LEAVEN : How do you know ? QUENTIN : Five o 'clock shadow . The last thing I remember was shaving . LEAVEN : I guess I missed breakfast or lunch or ... Whatever . QUENTIN : Well , don 't worry . I 'll be home in time for dinner . ( SQUEALING ) LEAVEN : ( CHUCKLES ) If we get out , I 'll make you dinner . QUENTIN : You got a date . Doing good . ( WHOOSHING ) I need to smoke ! I 'd smoke a butt off the sidewalk . Holloway . Just reel yourself in a bit . Come on . We 're moving ' along . Things are looking up . Okay , okay . You 're right . I quit smoking years ago . ( SIGHS ) I just need to be occupied . Talk , then . Have a conversation . What kind of doctor are you , anyway ? Uh ... Oh , you know , I 'm the free kind . Okay , chitchat , chitchat . Uh ... Um ... Come on , help me . Uh , tell me about your rug rats . Okay . We have three boys ... Nine , seven and five . Oh , good God . Poor woman . There 's no way I 'd survive that . Yeah , well , she didn 't , either . No , she 's not dead . We 're just separated . Uh ... I 'm sorry . I can 't just shoot the breeze . These numbers aren 't prime . Okay . Clear . Excuse me . Sorry . You , uh , could try and help me out here , buddy . No , I couldn 't . This one 's trapped , too . We have to backtrack ? Not yet . HOLLOWAY : Oh , no . Read them to me . HOLLOWAY : What are you , his coat rack ? LEAVEN : Oh , please . ( BANGING ) It 's stuck . ( SLIDING ) LEAVEN : ( GASPS ) Look out ! ( GROANS ) ( DOOR SLIDES SHUT ) This room is green . Holloway . Hi there . This room is green . HOLLOWAY : Yes , it is . I want to go back to the blue room . What is it , shock or what ? I think he 's mentally handicapped . I like the blue room . Jesus Christ . He almost broke my neck . Hey there , are you all alone ? You want to hold my hand , honey ? Mmm ... Butter first . Then honey , Kazan . Butter first , then honey . How 'd he survive ? I want to go back to the blue room . There 's lots of blue rooms . We 'll find you another one real soon . LEAVEN : This is just way too bizarre . Well , you just worry about your numbers then . Go on . I 'll look after him . Safe , obviously , since he almost fell on my head . HOLLOWAY : Shall we go for a walk , Kazan ? You want to go for a walk ? ( WAILING ) HOLLOWAY : Um ... Quentin ? Let 's not make him do the climbing thing right away . Holloway ... Holloway . HOLLOWAY : Could they have taken us all the way to New Mexico ? QUENTIN : What are you talking about , Holloway ? HOLLOWAY : I 'm talking about where do you hide something this big . LEAVEN : At least he 's good for something . Hey , I 'm sorry to shake your foundations , Quentin , but you have no idea where your tax dollars go . Free clinic doctors ? Only the military industrial complex could afford to build something this size . Holloway ... What is the military industrial complex ? Have you ever been there ? I 'm telling you , it 's not that complex . How would you know , from where you are ? Who do you think the establishment is ? It 's just guys like me . Their desks are bigger , but their jobs aren 't . They don 't conspire . They buy boats . No . This place is ... Remember Scaramanga ? The bad guy in The Man with the Golden Gun . Yeah . It 's some rich psycho 's entertainment . ( LAUGHING ) Is that what you think ? Clear . ( LAUGHING ) Okay . You 're a cop . Single bullet theory . Right on . ( CHOKING ) ( WAILING ) Gas ! Holloway , get back here ! ( COUGHS ) ( SWALLOWS ) It 's okay . I just swallowed my button . ( KAZAN WAILING ) LEAVEN : I hate this . I hate this . Your boy 's having a conniption fit in there . It 's like cramming without coffee . She needs a break . She can do it . They don 't look prime to me . Is that your two-bits worth , Worth ? For what it 's worth . Well ? Well , he 's right . Not prime . Stop ! In front of you . Ah ! What is it ? Ow ! ( KAZAN WAILING ) Shut up ! I don 't know what happened . It wasn 't prime . Quentin , hold still . ( KAZAN WAILING ) Somebody stop that racket ! Worth ! Leave the boots . ( WAILING ) And shut the fucking door ! I had a feeling about that fucking guy . He knew about that trap . But these numbers aren 't prime . Then your number system failed , but he knew . Knew what ? How would he know ? You 're the paranoid one . Think about it . His only function so far has been to kick us when we 're down . So he has a bad attitude . You saying that makes him a spy ? Trust me on this . It 's my job to read people like an x-ray . ( DOOR SLIDES OPEN ) He doesn 't like red rooms . ( SIGHS ) So what happened ? You saw what happened . Quentin ! I guess the numbers are more complicated than I thought . Maybe they mean nothing at all . LEAVEN : No . It means they 're more involved . They 've worked for us up to now , haven 't they ? I just need some more time with them . Well , we need to rest anyway . Well , that 's handy 'cause there 's not a fuck of a lot else we can do . Are they telling you anything ? They 're not tarot cards . Do you have any idea how many variables I have to consider before I can decipher numbers this size ? They don 't reveal themselves right away . They 're like people . LEAVEN : Oh , gross ! No , not here , honey . Over in the corner . ( URINATING ) What ? He 's just peeing . Jesus Christ . That 's excellent . Now it totally reeks in here ! You find this all pretty funny , don 't you ? What 's your fucking problem , Worth ? Even Holloway 's holding up better than you . Get over there and help her with him . That 's your job , baby-sitter . Jawohl , Kommandant . Somebody has to take responsibility around here . And that somebody has to be you . Not all of us have the luxury of playing nihilist . Not all of us are conceited enough to play hero . This is a will to live . Everybody 's got it , Worth , even you . Especially you , hiding behind that cynical front . A will to live . That 's the warm , cozy feeling deep inside ? Thanks , Quentin . I 'm a new man . Oh , poor Worth . Nobody loves me . If that 's the chip on your shoulder , why did you lug it all this way ? Why don 't you just lie down and die ? Do it . Show us you have some backbone and jump in the sushi machine . Be a man . Thought so . Fuck you , Quentin . I don 't wanna die . I 'm just being realistic . Do you think they 'd go to all the trouble to build this thing if we could just walk out ? Do you think they would 've left us clues and let us beat it so far if there wasn 't a way out ? You think we matter ? We don 't . Put us out of your misery so we can get on with getting out of here . Oh , you 're not getting out of here . - Yes , we are ! - No , you 're not . Yes , we are ! There is no way out of here ! Gotcha . How do you know that ? Answer the question , Worth . Oh , God . Who are you ? I 'm the poison . I designed the outer shell . The what ? The shell . The sarcophagus . You built this thing ? Not this part . The exterior . I don 't know anything about the numbers or anything else in here . I was contracted to draw plans for a hollow shell . A cube . A cube ? Why didn 't you tell us ? For God sakes , Worth , you knew what it was . No . Worth , You 're lying . Not at first . HOLLOWAY : Who 's behind it ? I don 't know . Who hired you ? I didn 't ask . I never even left my office . I talked on the phone to some people , other guys like me , specialists working on small details . Nobody knew what it was . Nobody cared . Bullshit ! You knew from square one . Look at him . He 's up to his eyeballs in this thing . No , Quentin . That 's how they stay hidden . You keep everyone separated so the left hand doesn 't know what the right hand is doing . The brain never comes out in the open . Whose brain ? It 's all the same machine , right ? The Pentagon , multinational corporations , the police . You do one little job . You build a widget in Saskatoon , and the next thing you know , it 's two miles under the desert , the essential component of a death machine . I was right all along ! My whole life , I knew it ! I told you , Quentin ! Nobody 's ever gonna call me paranoid again ! We gotta get out of here and blow the lid off this thing ! Holloway , you don 't get it . Then help me , please . I need to know . This may be hard for you to understand , but there is no conspiracy . Nobody is in charge . It 's a headless blunder operating under the illusion of a master plan . Can you grasp that ? Big brother is not watching you . What kind of fuckin explanation is that ? It 's the best you 're gonna get . I looked , and the only conclusion I can come to is that there is nobody up there . Somebody had to say yes to this thing . What thing ? Only we know what it is . We have no idea what it is . We know more than anybody else . I mean , somebody might 've known sometime before they got fired or voted out or sold it . But if this place ever had a purpose , then it got miscommunicated or lost in the shuffle . I mean , this is an accident , a forgotten , perpetual public works project . You think anybody wants to ask questions ? All they want is a clear conscience and a fat paycheck . I mean , I leaned on my shovel for months on this one . This was a great job . Why put people in it ? Because it 's here . You have to use it , or you admit it 's pointless . But it ... It is pointless ! Quentin , that 's my point . What have we come to ? It 's so much worse than I thought . Not really . Just more pathetic . You make me sick , Worth . I make me sick , too . We 're both part of the system . I drew a box , you walk a beat . It 's like you said , Quentin , " Just keep your head down , keep it simple , " just look at what 's in front of you . " I mean , nobody wants to see the big picture . Life 's too complicated . I mean , let 's face it . The reason we 're here is that it 's out of control . This is how we ruin the world ? LEAVEN : Well , duh ! Have you been on glue all your lives ? I 've felt guilty for ruining the world since I was , like , seven . God ! If you need someone to blame , throw a rock ! ( SIGHS ) Well , I feel better . That 's why you stayed with us . To confess . Still looking for someone to bust , Quentin ? ( GROANS ) LEAVEN : Quentin , stop it ! Stop it ! We need him . What for ? Have you gone absolutely mad ? He 's the only one who knows anything about the place . Worth . Hi . So there 's this outer shell . - Yeah . - And it 's a cube , right ? Like this ? I assume so . Are there any doors ? - This one door . - Where ? Wherever the door guy put it . Six guesses , and it 's sealed from the outside . And what are the dimensions of the outer shell ? Four hundred and thirty-four feet square . - May I ? - Come on , honey , slide over . ( GRUNTING ) Fourteen by fourteen by fourteen . The inner cube can 't be flush to the shell wall . I know that . There 's a space . One cube ? I don 't know . It makes sense . Okay . Well , the biggest that the cube can be , then , is 26 rooms high , 26 rooms across , so ... Seventeen thousand , five hundred and seventy-six rooms . Seventeen thousand , five hundred and seventy-six rooms ? Oh , God . That makes me queasy . Descartes ! Leaven , you are a genius . What ? What ? Cartesian coordinates . Of course ! Coded Cartesian coordinates . They 're used in geometry to plot points on a 3-dimensional graph . In English . Slower . Bonjour ? These numbers are markers . A grid reference , like latitude and longitude on a map . The numbers tell us where we are inside the cube . But where are we ? It works ! Okay , um , all we have to do is add the numbers together . X coordinate is 19 . Y is ... Twenty-six rooms . So that places us seven rooms from the edge . All right . Let 's go . Just out of curiosity ... I mean , don 't hit me again or anything , but what are you gonna do when you get there ? Maybe we can get the door open . Huh . Oh . What we need to do is figure out how to get around the traps . I 'm dealing with that , Holloway . I 'm looking for practical solutions here . Well , you haven 't found any yet . We cut the risk with the numbers and the boot . Worth will go in first . No , he won 't , Quentin . We take turns ! Relax . QUENTIN : Room for two in there ? What 's the matter ? LEAVEN : These coordinates . 14 , 27 , 14 . - QUENTIN : What about ' em ? - Well , they don 't make sense . Assuming the cube is 26 rooms across , there can 't be a coordinate larger than 26 . If this were right , then we would be outside of the cube . No . Not outside of the cube . QUENTIN : Oh . Guess that means we 're not having dinner . KAZAN : Trap , trap , trap , trap . QUENTIN : Let 's hope this one 's safe . KAZAN : Trap , trap , trap . Trap ! Trap ! ( WHISPERS ) Sound activated . Boo . Lovely . How come the sound of the door opening didn 't set it off ? Must be rigged to ignore it . So that 's it . The edge is surrounded by traps . Well , I guess we have to backtrack and try somewhere else . QUENTIN : Who knows how many detours we 'll have to take ? I say we cross the bitch . Right . How many boots do we have left , Holloway ? Get it off him . We know how it works . We just have to be quiet . That 's pretty fucking quiet . I 'm glad you 're on side , Worth , 'cause you 're up . KAZAN : Ah ! And he 's not coming . Of course he is . - No way . - You 're not leaving him behind . He 's unpredictable . When we get to the edge , we can come back for him , but he 'll get somebody killed here ! Am I right ? HOLLOWAY : Shame on you . Will you look at yourselves ? What have you turned into ? They may have taken our lives away , but we 're still human beings . That 's all we 've got left . We 'll come back for him . That 's a lie , and you know it . ( BREATHES DEEPLY ) ( HUMS SOFTLY ) He 'll be quiet . ( DOOR SLIDING ) ( RUMBLING ) ( CLICKS ) ( BOTH MOUTHING ) ( HANDLE CLICKS ) ( CLICKS ) ( BREATHES SOFTLY ) Ah ! ( GASPS ) ( SCREAMING ) You fucking fuck ! All right , that 's enough ! He 's a trap ! Let him go right now ! Law of the jungle , Holloway . He 's endangering the pack . Let him go , you Nazi ! What 'd you call me ? Quentin , you let that innocent boy go . You listen to me , woman . Every day I mop up after your bleeding heart . The only reason you even exist is because I keep you ! ( WHISPERS ) I know your type . No kids , no man to fuck you , so you go around outraged , sticking your nose up other people 's assholes , sniffing their business ! You missed your boat , Holloway . You 're all dried up inside there , aren 't you ? That 's your fucking problem . How dare you say that to her ? You don 't know her , Quentin . None of us know each other here . Oh , I do . No , you don 't ! No wonder your wife left you . All that bottled up anger . And a thing for young girls . HOLLOWAY : Ow ! God help you , Quentin . Did you smack your kids around , too ? Is anybody besides me interested in what 's on the other side of that door ? Open it . Door number six , not number one , door number two ? Open the fucking thing . Oh . Sunshine . Nighttime . My old friend , the shell . It 's there . Morning ! ECHO : Morning ... Morning ... Hang on to me . Can 't see shit . Nothing to hang on to . We gotta try something . We gotta see if the door 's over there . Someone has to swing over there and take a look . WORTH : Swing ? We make a rope out of clothes . Take ' em off . I 'll tie it around myself . Oh , yeah , you 're gonna go . You weigh , like , 500 pounds . It 'll snap in 2 seconds . I 'm the lightest . Forget it . I 'll go . I 'm going , Holloway . She 's right , Quentin . You 're too heavy . I 'm the lightest after Leaven . Anyways , it 's my turn . How long did you know people were being put in here ? Couple months . That 's not long , if you consider your whole life . I am . You opened my eyes , Worth . That 's something . David . Helen . You 're such a Helen . That 's as far as you go ! HOLLOWAY : There 's nothing down here ! Hold tight . I 'll try swinging over there . ( ALL GRUNT ) Brace yourselves . I 'm gonna try again . Okay . One more time . Hurry ! You 're getting heavy . ( RUMBLING ) ( HOLLOWAY SCREAMS ) What the hell 's going on ? QUENTIN : Get up here now ! ( GRUNTING ) ( CHUCKLES ) WORTH : Quentin ! LEAVEN : Have you got her ? WORTH : What 's going on ? LEAVEN : Quentin , is she okay ? ( SCREAMING ) No ! She , uh ... Slipped . KAZAN : Holloway ? ( SOBS ) ( KAZAN WAILING ) Hey . Shh . Come on , Kazan . ( CONTINUES WAILING ) ( SHOUTS ) Kazan , will you please stop doing that ? Leaven , you gotta be strong , sweetheart . Don 't even talk to me . We gotta get down to the bottom . It 'll be easier to get onto the shell from there . It 's a long fuckin ' way with only one boot , but we gotta do it before we get too weak . You gotta keep cracking the numbers , Leaven . I can 't think any more . Sure you can . It 's your gift . It 's not a gift . It 's just a brain . Let her sleep for a while . We haven 't slept in fuck knows how long . All right . One hour . How the fuck are you gonna know how long an hour is ? An hour is as long as I say . Shh . ( GROGGILY ) What are you doing ? We have to make it down to the bottom . It 'll be quiet there and you can concentrate . You just wanna leave them ? They 're traps , Leaven . We are the key . I 'll get us down there . You think us out . Believe in me . Try and see what I see , how my mind works , the flash when I look into someone 's head , like a fucking x-ray . I looked through the walls . I dreamed him at his desk , designing everything . He can 't let you solve the puzzle , see , because there is a purpose . We are the purpose . The cube is us . - Quentin ... - We fit like numbers . A man and a woman . Two halves of the equation . I take you down ... The perfect key . I slip you in the lock . LEAVEN : Ah ! Leaven , it 's time to go down . ( WHINING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( DOOR SLIDES SHUT ) Get away from her . Leaven , they 're fucking spies . Him , the retard . Holloway had outside information about my family , but she slipped up , didn 't she ? She crossed the line . You dropped her . Just go , Quentin . Give us the boot , you pig ! Ah ! ( GRUNTS ) You don 't want the boot . ( MOANING ) ( THUDDING ) QUENTIN : You want to come with us , Worth ? Down the hatch . ( WORTH SCREAMS ) ( THUDS ) ( SOBS ) ( WORTH LAUGHING ) What the fuck 's with him ? ( WORTH CONTINUES LAUGHING ) ( WORTH CONTINUES LAUGHING ) How did he ... ( LAUGHING ) It 's , it 's ... It 's the Wren . The old Wrenster . How could ... We 've been going in circles . ( LAUGHING ) That can 't be . - Where are we ? - I don 't know . ( DOOR SLIDES OPEN ) - Where are we ? - ( GRUNTING ) You figure it out . You haven 't done anything . All you did was freak out , you murderer ! ( SOBBING ) ( LAUGHING ) I guess you were right , Worth . There is no way out of here . ( SOBBING SOFTLY ) Get away from me . ( QUENTIN CRYING ) Wasn 't Rennes killed in that room ? How come there 's nothing out there ? It 's the edge . But we weren 't at the edge before . Where 's the room that killed Rennes ? Fuck off ! Oh , that was good . What difference does it make ? We 're dead , anyways . Hey ! ( BANGING ) Listen to what I 'm saying . There was a room there before . We haven 't been moving in circles . The rooms have . ( WHISPERS ) Of course . The rooms ? That explains the thunder and the shaking . We 've been shifting the whole time . It 's the only logical explanation . I am such an idiot . What are you onto , Leaven ? Gimme a minute . Okay , the numbers are markers , points on a map , right ? Right . Then how do you map a point that keeps moving ? Permutations . " Perm u " what ? Permutations . A list of all the coordinates that the room passes through . Like a map that tells you where the room starts , how many times it moves , and where it moves to . A number tells you all that ? I don 't know . See , I 've only been looking at one point on the map , which is probably the starting position . All I saw was what the cube looked like before it started to move . Okay , so it 's moving . How do we get out ? Twenty-seven . I know where the exit is . Where ? - Stay away from me . - Back off , Quentin . I just wanna know . Don 't you wanna know ? You remember that room we passed through before , the one with the coordinate larger than 26 ? What about it ? That coordinate placed the room outside the cube . A bridge . Right . But only in its original position . What are you talking about ? Look , the room starts off as a bridge , and then it moves its way through the maze , which is where we ran into it , but at some point , it must return to its original position . So the bridge is only a bridge ... For a short period of time . This thing is like a giant combination lock . When the rooms are in their starting position , the lock is open . But when they move out of alignment , the lock closes . With a structure this size , it must take days for the rooms to complete a full cycle . So when does it open ? Don 't . To find the original coordinates , the numbers are added together . To find the permutations , they 're subtracted from one another . That 's it . This room moves to zero , one , and negative one on the x-axis . Two , five , and negative seven on y . And one , negative one , and zero on z . And what does that mean ? You suck at math ? Okay , I need the room numbers around us as a reference point . 6-6-6 . 8-9-7 . 4-6-6 . ( DOOR SLIDES OPEN ) 5-6-7 , 8-9-8 . - Okay ? - Yes . And 5-4-5 . Did you get that ? 6-5-6 , 7-7-8 , 4-6-2 . LEAVEN : That 's enough . X is 17 , y is 25 , and z is 14 . Which means this room makes two more moves before returning to its original position . - Do we have time ? - Maybe . Then let 's go . Can you work the traps for this system ? Fuck the traps . Let 's get to the bridge . Well , you threw out our last boot , you fucking idiot . - Technically , I can identify the traps . - Technically ? First , I thought that they were identified by prime numbers , but they 're not . They 're identified by numbers that are the power of a prime . - Okay , so ? - Can you calculate it ? The numbers are huge . But you can , right ? She can . I 'd have to calculate the number of factors in each set . - Maybe if I had a computer . - You don 't need a computer . - Yes , I do ! - Figure it out . - I can 't ! - I 'm not dying in a fucking rat maze ! Look , nobody in the whole world could do it mentally . Look at the numbers . 567 , 898 , 545 . There 's no way I can factor that . I can 't even start on 567 . It 's astronomical ! KAZAN : Two . Astronomical . What did you say ? Astronomical . WORTH : Before that . Factors . How many factors , Kazan , of 567 ? Two . What , are you fucking kidding ? Kazan , how many factors does 30 have ? Three . - LEAVEN : How about seven ? - One . Gumdrop . I don 't have any gumdrops . Gumdrop . Kazan , I 'll give ya a whole box of gumdrops for each answer . Gumdrops come in bags . Okay , you want ' em in bags , you got ' em in bags . KAZAN : I don 't like the red ones . ( DOOR SLIDES OPEN ) 8-9-8 . Two . 5-4-5 . - Two . - He 's giving us the factors . Astronomical . You 're telling me telethon boy is a genius ? By those numbers , the room should be safe . Only one way to find out . Don 't ! ( GROANS ) Safe . Kazan , my man . QUENTIN : What 's the number , buddy boy ? Hey ! Right here . Look here ! Make him do it . Kazan , we 're gonna do some numbers now , okay ? We like to do numbers , right ? - Prime numbers . - That 's right . Can you tell me the factor of 6-5-6 ? Two . - 7-7-9 ? - Two . 4-6-2 ? - Three . - Clear . Move . Come on . Come on , let 's go . You , too , Worth . QUENTIN : Move your scrawny ass , Worth . I 'm not through with you yet . Leaven , open that door . Get Einstein workin ' on the numbers . ( CHOKING ) - Oh , jeez . - Go ! - Worth ... - WORTH : Hurry ! Leaven . 5-6-3 ? Please , Kazan . 5-6-3 . You fuckers . You 're dead . - Two . - Clear . One . Trapped . - Check the floor . - Is he dead ? - QUENTIN : Ah ! - Not quite . QUENTIN : Not even close ! Worth , I 'm getting out of here , and I 'll feed you to a fucking trap on the way ! Where is he ? Come here . I said come here right now ! ( WORTH GRUNTS ) WORTH : Gotcha . That way . - Two . - Clear . - Four . - Clear . WORTH : Whoa . LEAVEN : Whoa . ( ECHOING ) ( CRASHING ) ( THUDDING ) WORTH : Guess that proves our theory . Numbers . KAZAN : Four . Two . Three . Clear . ( RUMBLING ) BOTH : Kazan ! ( KAZAN WAILING ) ( WHISPERS ) Listen . He hasn 't moved far . I 'll go find him . What do you think ? You don 't have a lot of lives left . Ah . Ah . ( DOOR SLIDES OPEN ) Kazan . I didn 't move . Yeah , good , but you 're gonna have to climb up here , okay ? I don 't like that . Fourteen ... Twenty-six ... Fourteen . Worth , get back here right now ! Five bags of gumdrops . Twenty-seven bags total . Twenty-seven bags . Deal . Worth , this room 's next move takes it to the bridge ! We 're coming ! Over here . Move it ! We don 't have much time . Come on . ( RUMBLING ) ( ALL GRUNTING ) ( THUDS ) Worth . Worth . ( GASPS ) ( GROANS ) This better be it . LEAVEN : It should be . Where ? Oh , Well . ( DOOR SLIDES SHUT ) Give it a minute . Be patient . So , guess what . No . This is the room we started in . ( CHUCKLES ) I was right . We should never have moved in the first place . ( CHUCKLES ) ( RUMBLING ) ( THUDS ) ( GASPS HAPPILY ) The bridge . Red . LEAVEN : Kazan ... Four . Two . Four . Clear . ( DOOR SLIDES SHUT ) ( SOBS ) Worth . Go ahead . What are you doing ? You can 't quit now . It 's not your fault ! I have nothing to live for out there . What is out there ? WORTH : Boundless human stupidity . ( DOOR SLIDES OPEN ) I can live with that . ( GASPS ) ( SCREAMS ) - Kazan , get out through the door ! - ( WAILING ) ( GASPS ) Red , Kazan . ( WAILING ) ( RUMBLING ) ( SCREAMS ) ( THUDS )

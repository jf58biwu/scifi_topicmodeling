 [ Growling Softly ] [ Slurping ] [ Typing ] [ Hisses ] [ Ripley Narrating ] My mommy always said there were no monsters . No real ones . But there are . [ Chattering ] [ Man ] We 've seen no additional defects . She 's perfect . Mm-hmm . [ Breathing Heavily ] [ Electronic Whirring ] [ Machine Beeping ] Careful . Two centimeters . Okay . Yeah . Ready with that amnio . [ Beeping Continues ] Oh . And ... there it is . - [ Gasps ] - [ Exhales ] No . [ Alarm Beeping ] [ Clicks ] Be careful . [ Alarm Stops ] [ Screeches ] Jesus . Clamp . What about her ? Can we keep her alive ? How 's the host ? - [ Beeping ] - Doing well . Sew her back up . [ Mouths Word ] Excellent work , everybody . [ Screaming ] [ Alien Screeching , Faint ] [ Hatch Opens ] And how is our Number 8 today ? Appears to be in good health . Hmm ? How good ? Excellent , as in completely off our projected charts . Look at the scar tissue . See the recession ? This is from three days ago ? Exactly . Oh , this is good . This is very good . You 're gonna make us all very proud . [ Grunting ] [ Gasps , Wheezing ] [ Choking ] [ Groans ] No . [ Panting ] Don 't . I 'm all right . Now try this . [ Mouthing Word ] - Hand . - Close . Glove . [ Woman Over Monitor ] Number 8 ? Fruit . [ Woman Continues ] Good . Cherries . It 's unprecedented . Totally . She 's operating ... at a completely adult capacity . What about her memories ? There are gaps . - And some degree of synaptic dissonance . - [ Woman ] You know this . She 's freaked . [ Woman ] Come on . It has connective difficulties , caused by a biochemical imbalance , causing emotional autism . Certain reactions — All right , wait a second ! It has memories . Why does it have memories ? Well , I 'm guessing , but ... inherited memories , passed down generationally at a genetic level ... by the aliens , like its strength . Plus a , uh , highly evolved form of instinct . An unexpected benefit from the genetic crossing . Oh , ho , ho , ho , ho . I see . Stupid me . Of course . An unexpected benefit of the genetic process . Oh ! And I didn 't even think of that ! Let 's try this one . Ripley ? Ripley . Ripley , what is it ? Ripley ? Ripley ? [ Man ] You 're not thinking termination ? Oh , boy , am I thinking termination . General , we do not perceive this to be a problem . Ellen Ripley died trying to wipe this species out . For all intents and purposes , she succeeded . I 'm not anxious to see her taking up her old hobbies . That won 't happen . We won 't tell her . Oh , I see . And that 's supposed to comfort me ? [ Beeping ] [ Male Electronic voice ] Identification , please . [ Exhaling ] [ Whirring , Buzzes ] Please try again . [ Exhaling ] Thank you , General Perez . Bottom line is , she looks at me funny one time , I 'm putting her down . Okay , as far as I 'm concerned , Number 8 ... is a meat ... by-product . Her Majesty here is the real payoff . When does she start producing ? Days . Less maybe . We need the cargo . I told you , it 's on its way . [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Roaring ] [ Growling ] Fork . - Fuck . - It 's-It 's " fork .

Oh , they went under decades ago , Gediman . Way before your time . Bought out by Wal-Mart . Fortunes of war . [ Chuckles ] [ Fork Clinks ] I think you will find that , uh , things have changed a great deal since your time . I doubt that . We 're not flying blind here , you know . It 's United Systems Military , not some greedy corporation . Oh . [ Chuckles ] Well , it won 't make any difference . You 're still gonna die . How do you feel about that ? I wish you could understand what we 're trying to do here . The potential for this species goes way beyond urban pacification . New alloys , new vaccines . Nothing like this we 've ever seen on any world before . You should be very proud . Oh . I am . And the animal itself - wondrous . The potential , unbelievable , once we 've tamed them .

Nobody is left behind . Not even you , Johner . - What 's the quickest way out of here ? - After the cooling tower , there 's a freight elevator . It runs from the top of the ship down to Engineering Level 1 deck . - Take us straight to the dock . - Sounds reasonable . Let 's do it . We 're moving . - What ? - [ Ripley ] The ship is moving . I can feel it . The ship has stealth run . There 's no way you can tell . She 's right . The ship 's been go since the attack . That 's a standard emergency procedure . That 's right .

Inside me ? What 's inside me ? [ Johner ] Hey , man . I don 't want one of those things birthing anywhere near my ass . It 's a bad risk . - What 's inside me ? - Look , we can 't just leave him here . - I thought you came here to stop ' em from spreading ' . - What 's inside me ? - There 's gotta be a process . Can 't you stop it ? - [ Christie ] Got no time for that . - I can 't do it here . The lab is out of order . - What 's inside me ? I could do him . Back of the head . Painless . It might be the best way . - What 's inside me ? - No , there 's got to be another way . [ Call ] What if we freeze him ? What 's in-fuckin ' - side me ? A parasite ! Foreign element . There 's a monster in your chest . These guys hijacked your ship , and they sold your cryo tube ... to this ... human , and he put an alien inside ofyou . It 's a really nasty one . And in a few hours , it 's gonna burst its way through your rib cage ... and you 're gonna die . Any questions ? [ Breathing Erratically ] Who are you ? I 'm the monster 's mother . [ Call ] Look , he comes with us , we freeze him on the Betty , - then the doctor can remove it later . - Fine with me . Since when were you in goddamn charge ? - Since you were born without balls ! - Ease off , people . All right . You come with us . You might even live . [ Christie ] Get twitchy on me , and you 'll be shot . Let 's move out . [ Johner ] It 's a mess down there ! Is this the only way ? vriess , we gotta lose the chair . I know . Kawlang maneuver , all right ? Yeah , just like old times . Yeah . Must be the cooling tanks . Somebody must have opened the valves . The nasties couldn 't have done this , could they ? We 're at the bottom ofthe ship . We have to go through the kitchen , maybe 90 feet , to the freight elevator on the other side . - I don 't like it . - What 's to like ? This sucks ! - Wren , are you sure about the distance ? - Yes . - You ready to get wet , partner ? - Yeah . [ Coughs ] Hey , uh , do your weapons fire underwater ? - Yeah , they 're disposables . They can take it . - Disposables ? [ Laughing ] Hey , I heard about those . Yeah . - How many rounds ? - Twenty . Split points give you a good hole , even at the smaller caliber . Oh . Hey , that 's cool . [ Laughing ] Yeah . They 're big with hitters 'cause you , uh , throw ' em away after the job . Nobody likes to throw away a weapon they 're attached to . You know what I mean ? Yeah . Guess I don 't have to tell everyone to take a deep breath . [ Chuckles ] [ vriess ] Hey , Christie , do me a favor . When we hit the surface on the other side , no backstroke , okay ?

Man , I never , never thought that I would see one ! Great . She 's a toaster oven . Can we leave now ? - [ Distephano Laughing ] - [ Ripley ] How long before we land ?

How can you stand being what you are ? Not much choice . At least there 's a part of you that 's human . [ Sighs ] I 'm just — Look at me . I 'm disgusting . Why did you come here ? To kill you , remember ? Before the recall , I accessed the mainframe . Every dirty little covert op the government ever dreamed of is in there . And this-you , the aliens , even the crew from the Betty - I knew if they succeeded , it would be the end of them . Why do you care what happens to them ? Because I 'm programmed to . You 're programmed to be an asshole ? You 're the new asshole model they 're putting out ? Come on . I couldn 't watch ' em do it . I couldn 't let ' em annihilate themselves . Do you understand that ? I did once . I tried to save ... people . It didn 't work out . There was this girl . She had bad dreams . I tried to help her . She died . Now I can 't even remember her name . I guess we 're almost there . [ Ripley ] Right . [ Ripley Sighs ] Do you dream ? [ Call ] I — Well , we have neuroprocessors that - Yes . [ Ripley ] When I sleep , I dream about them — it . Every night . All around me , in me . I used to be afraid to dream , but I 'm not anymore . Why ? [ Ripley Chuckles ] Because no matter how bad the dreams get , when I wake up , it 's always worse . - [ Distephano ] It 's not so far now ! - God , I 'm so tired . [ Johner ] Sleep when you die , man . Oh , no . This is bad , right ? - I think we 're near the nest . - Well , then we 'll go another way . We don 't have time . We got nearly 90 minutes . - Not anymore . - What are you saying ? - What did you do , robot ? - Let 's go . Come on . Hey ! You want to die here with your little brothers and sisters , that 's cool ! But I plan to live past today ! If this little hunk of plastic is pulling any shit , I 'm gonna kill her ! Kill you ! Does that compute ? Or do I have to draw you a schematic ? [ Gagging ] Hey ! - You want another souvenir ? - [ Gagging Continues ] - How far are the docks ? - A h-hundred yards . Ripley . Come on . Ripley , we have to go . I hear them . I hear them . They 're so close . Ripley . It 's the queen . She 's in pain . - [ Screams ] - Ripley ! Ripley ! Wait ! Oh , my God .

[ vriess ] It 's up to you now , Call . I need you to patch into the ship again and open the hatch . [ Computer Beeping ] [ Beeps ] Johner , we should put Purvis in the freezer now . [ Johner ] All right , little buddy . Nap time . [ Screams ] - Oh ! - [ Call Whimpering ] Nobody moves , or I put a cap ... right where this little droid 's brain is . Distephano , take the weapons . Begging your pardon , sir , but fuck you ! Oh , fine . Then I kill her , and you kill me , and we all die , and nobody goes home ! Now drop the weapon . Then this little synthetic bitch ... is gonna plug into the Auriga , and she is gonna take us right back to home base , according to the standard emergency procedures . - No , she 's not . - [ Distephano ] Are you crazy ? You still want to bring those things back to Earth ? - Haven 't you been paying any attention today ? - Ah , the intellectual speaks . Stay there ! Listen , if you don 't — Don 't you ever shut up ? [ Groaning ] [ Grunting ] - Why does nobody listen to me ? - [ Grunting ] [ Screaming ] [ Screeching ] [ Screeching Continues ] [ Shouting ] [ Gediman ] I told you . At first , everything was normal . The queen laid her eggs . But then she started to change . She added a second cycle cell . So , this time there is no host . There are no eggs . There is only her womb ... and the creature inside . That is Ripley 's gift to her : a human reproductive system . She is giving birth for you , Ripley , and now she is perfect ! [ Growling ] [ Roaring ] [ Growling ] [ Groans ] [ Screeching ] [ Gasping ] [ Screeching Continues ] [ Roars ] [ Roaring ] You are ... a beautiful , beautiful butterfly .

Uh , I 'm just , uh , finding the , uh , manual override . - For Christ 's sake . - [ Johner ] Hey , Ripley . Good memory . Excuse me . Ripley 's back , man . Is that it ? Nope . You can 't fly one of these things too , can you ? Are you kidding ? This piece of shit is even older than I am . - [ Beeping ] - Goddamn it . We 've still got breach . The hatch . - I closed it . - Fixed the goddamn hatch a hundred times , man ! - I 'll get it . I 'll get it . - [ Exhales ] [ Beeps ] [ Electricity Buzzes ] [ Father ] Approaching Earth 's atmosphere . Window of departure now 46 seconds . Call , we have to go . - [ Beeping ] - Call .

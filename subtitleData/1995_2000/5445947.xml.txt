WHO IS THIS ? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS ? GO TO HER . [ Line Disconnects ] [ Doorbell Rings ] MR. SIM , MY NAME IS DANA SCULLY . I 'M VERY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS , AND I 'M SORRY TO DISTURB YOU AT THIS HOUR . WHAT DO YOU WANT ? I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL LESS THAN AN HOUR AGO . I WAS ADDRESSED BY NAME , AND TOLD THAT I NEEDED TO HELP SOMEONE , A WOMAN . I TRACED THE CALL , AND IT CAME FROM YOUR HOUSE . I HAVE NO EARTHLY IDEA WHAT YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT . THIS IS THE SECOND TIME TODAY THIS HAS HAPPENED . I 'D LIKE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT . YOU WERE HERE EARLIER . YES , THE DETECTIVE TOLD ME ... YES . SOMETHING ABOUT A SCREWUP WITH THE PHONES . I 'M IN A MEETING . NO ONE 'S CALLED YOU FROM HERE , NOT EARLIER TODAY , AND CERTAINLY NOT TONIGHT . YOU CAN 'T IMAGINE HOW BAD A DAY THIS HAS BEEN FOR MY DAUGHTER AND MYSELF . I UNDERSTAND- - IF YOU UNDERSTAND , THEN YOU 'LL STOP COMING AROUND , UPSETTING ME WITH THIS ... NONSENSE . PLEASE . SCULLY , F.B.I. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU AT THIS UNGODLY HOUR ? I 'D LIKE TO SEE EVERYTHING YOU HAVE ON THE ROBERTA SIM CASE . THE ROBERTA SIM CASE ? THERE IS NO ROBERTA SIM CASE . IT 'S A SIMPLE SUICIDE . WE WENT THROUGH THIS BEFORE , YOU AND I , DIDN 'T WE ? WHATEVER YOU WISH TO CALL IT , I 'D APPRECIATE SEEING EVERYTHING YOU HAVE . IN THE SPIRIT OF THE SEASON ? SO , WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR ? CAN YOU EVEN TELL ME ? IT SAYS HERE YOUR PRECINCT VISITED THE SIMS BEFORE , TWO WEEKS AGO . A DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE CALL ? WE SENT A UNIT BECAUSE THE NEIGHBORS WERE COMPLAINING . THEY WERE SCREAMING AT EACH OTHER . WASN 'T A HAPPY HOUSEHOLD . HAPPY PEOPLE DON 'T KILL THEMSELVES . - THEY RAN A TOX SCREEN ? - YEAH , IT 'S JUST PROCEDURE . IT SAYS THEY TURNED UP HIGH LEVELS OF DORITRIPTAN . SOME KIND OF NEW MIGRAINE MEDICINE . APPARENTLY , YOU TAKE ENOUGH OF IT , YOU 'RE WEARING A CLOUD FOR A HAT . I FIGURE SHE ANESTHETIZED HERSELF AND THEN- - FOUND A BUNCH OF EMPTY SAMPLE PACKETS IN THE BATHROOM TRASH , A COUPLE MORE IN HER PURSE . I 'D LIKE TO BORROW THIS . [ Typing ] SHE WAS ADOPTED . DANNY , HI . IT 'S ME , DANA . YEAH , MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU TOO . I 'M WONDERING IF YOU CAN DO ME A FAVOR . UM , I NEED THE COMPLETE CASE FILES ... ON MY SISTER , MELISSA SCULLY . YEAH , CRIME SCENE AND AUTOPSY , ALONG WITH THE P.C.R.s THAT WE RAN . RIGHT , BUT I NEED YOU TO SEND THEM TO THE SAN DIEGO FIELD OFFICE ... AS SOON AS POSSIBLE . OKAY . THANKS , DANNY . - DANA ? - WHAT ? IS THIS WHERE YOU STAYED THE NIGHT ? YEAH . SOME OF IT . IT 'S A VACATION . WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON THAT 'S SO IMPORTANT ? UH ... SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS . SO , YOU UP FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING ? I 'VE GOT A LITTLE WORK TO DO . CAN I JOIN YOU GUYS LATER ? HOW ARE YOU GONNA GET AROUND ? I 'LL RENT A CAR . ALL RIGHT . LUNCH . WE 'LL HOLD YOU TO THAT . AGENT SCULLY . IT 'S BEEN , WHAT , FOUR HOURS ? I WAS GETTING WORRIED . I 'D LIKE TO ORDER AN AUTOPSY ON ROBERTA SIM . THERE 'S A POSSIBILITY SHE WAS MURDERED . WHAT , YOU GOT ANOTHER PHONE CALL ? I THINK IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE HUSBAND . WHERE DID YOU GET THAT IDEA ? YOU WANT COFFEE ? NO , THANKS . HE 'S GOT AN IRONCLAD ALIBI . MR. SIM WAS AT THE DOCTOR 'S OFFICE WITH HIS DAUGHTER . HE WAS THERE ALL MORNING . I CHECKED . I TOOK ANOTHER LOOK AT THE POLICE PHOTOS THIS MORNING . THERE WERE NO HESITATION CUTS ON ROBERTA SIM 'S WRISTS . SUICIDE VICTIMS SELDOM MAKE THE FATAL CUT ON THE FIRST TRY . SELDOM , BUT NOT ALWAYS . IS THAT ALL YOU GOT ? NO . WHY WAS THE PHONE OFF THE HOOK WHEN YOU GOT TO THE SIMS ' HOUSE ? THE WIFE TOOK IT OFF . I 'M GUESSING SHE DIDN 'T WANT TO BE INTERRUPTED . YOUR INCIDENT REPORT SAYS THE HUSBAND CALLED THE POLICE ... - AFTER HE DISCOVERED HIS WIFE DEAD . - YEAH . BUT IF THE PHONE WAS OFF THE HOOK WHEN YOU ARRIVED , HOW DID HE CALL YOU ? DID HE FIND THE PHONE OFF THE HOOK , CALL YOU ... AND THEN HAVE THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO RETURN IT TO THE WAY HE FOUND IT ? - DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TO YOU ? - WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING ? I 'M SUGGESTING THAT THERE ARE QUESTIONS WHICH BEG FURTHER INVESTIGATION . ORDER AN AUTOPSY . THE STOMACH CONTENTS APPEAR TO INCLUDE COFFEE , WHOLE WHEAT TOAST AND CANTALOUPE . NO MEDICINE TABLETS . EMPTY SAMPLE PACKETS OF DORITRIPTAN SUCCINATE WERE FOUND , BUT I SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT THERE WERE ANY PILLS INGESTED . WELL , OBVIOUSLY THERE WERE . DORITRIPTAN SHOWED UP ON THE TOX SCREEN . THEN WHY DIDN 'T IT SHOW UP IN HER STOMACH ? IT WAS ABSORBED INTO THE BLOODSTREAM . I DON 'T BELIEVE THE ABSORPTION WOULD BE THAT COMPLETE , NOT THAT CLOSE TO HER DEATH . THEN HOW DID THE DORITRIPTAN GET IN HER SYSTEM , MS. SCULLY ? - A NEEDLE PUNCTURE ? - ON THE HEEL OF HER RIGHT FOOT . EXTREMELY TINY AND EASY TO MISS . IT WAS MEANT TO BE OVERLOOKED . I BELIEVE THAT THIS WOMAN WAS INJECTED , ANESTHETIZED SO SHE WOULDN 'T FIGHT BACK , THEN HER SUICIDE WAS STAGED . - WHAT DO YOU THINK ? - IT 'S A POSSIBILITY . THEN AGAIN , IT 'S POSSIBLE THIS WOMAN SIMPLY STEPPED ON A TACK , AND THE REST IS BLUE-SKY CONJECTURE . I 'D SAY IT JUSTIFIES OPENING A MURDER INVESTIGATION . THIS IS YOUR DOING , ISN 'T IT ? YOU DIDN 'T HAVE THE DECENCY ... TO LEAVE ME AND MY DAUGHTER ALONE . MR. SIM , PLEASE . NOW YOU 'RE GONNA WANT TO CALM DOWN AND LET US DO OUR BUSINESS , OKAY ? WHERE IS YOUR DAUGHTER RIGHT NOW ? WHY ? SHE 'S AT A FRIEND 'S HOUSE . THANK GOD , SHE 'S NOT HERE TO SEE THIS . DETECTIVE , THIS WAS IN THE TRASH OUT BACK . YOU GOT AN EXPLANATION FOR THIS ? YES . MY DAUGHTER HAS A SEVERE FORM OF ANEMIA . SHE REQUIRES DAILY INJECTIONS . WE 'LL CHECK THAT OUT . I WANT YOU TO ANALYZE THIS , GET A P.C.R. ON THE BLOOD . WE NEED TO IDENTIFY WHOSE IT IS . OKAY . DANA , ARE YOU ALL RIGHT ? IT 'S 2 : 00 IN THE MORNING . WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL DAY ? WE WERE EXPECTING YOU FOR LUNCH . MOM ... SIT DOWN . THE WOMAN WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE HAS AN ADOPTED DAUGHTER . A THREE-YEAR-OLD NAMED EMILY . I GOT A SAMPLE OF EMILY 'S BLOOD , AND I HAD THE LAB RUN A TEST ON HER DNA . IT 'S CALLED A P.C.R. TEST . THIS IS EMILY 'S . THIS ... IS MELISSA 'S ... WHICH WE RAN DURING HER MURDER INVESTIGATION . THEY MATCH . WHAT DOES IT MEAN , " THEY MATCH " ? IT MEANS ... THAT THIS LITTLE GIRL , EMILY , IS MELISSA 'S DAUGHTER . IT 'S NOT POSSIBLE . YOU CAN 'T DENY THAT THERE 'S A REMARKABLE RESEMBLANCE . MELISSA WAS THREE YEARS OLD WHEN THIS PICTURE WAS TAKEN . SHE WAS PRACTICALLY A BABY . ALL KIDS CAN LOOK THE SAME AT THAT AGE . MOM , IT 'S UNCANNY . EMILY LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE MELISSA . THAT 'S WHY I ORDERED THE P.C.R. TEST ; BECAUSE HER FACE MAY CHANGE , BUT HER DNA CAN 'T . AND THAT TEST IS ACCURATE ? THERE IS A 60 % CHANCE THAT MELISSA IS EMILY 'S MOTHER . I 'M GOING TO ORDER A MORE COMPREHENSIVE TEST : AN R.F.L.P. IT 'LL TAKE A COUPLE OF DAYS , THEN WE 'LL BE SURE . I AM ALREADY SURE YOUR SISTER DID NOT HAVE A BABY . SHE WOULD HAVE TOLD ME . MOM ... REMEMBER ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO , MELISSA TOOK OFF ? SHE TRAVELED UP AND DOWN THE WEST COAST . WE DIDN 'T KNOW WHERE SHE WAS HALF THE TIME . YOU 'RE SAYING SHE WAS PREGNANT , AND SHE DIDN 'T WANT US TO KNOW ? THAT WAS 1994 . EMILY WAS BORN THAT NOVEMBER . SHE COULD HAVE GIVEN HER UP FOR ADOPTION AND NONE OF US WOULD HAVE EVER KNOWN . DANA , LISTEN TO ME . I KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE GOING THROUGH . MOM , THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING I 'M GOING THROUGH . IT HAS HAPPENED TO ME . WHEN YOUR FATHER DIED , IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE HE LEFT ME . I SAW HIM IN MY DREAMS . THE PHONE WOULD RING AND , JUST FOR A MOMENT , I WAS SURE IT WAS HIS VOICE . AND YOU 'RE DOING THE SAME THING WITH MELISSA . YOU 'RE SEEING HER IN THIS CHILD . BUT THAT DOES NOT MAKE THIS CHILD MY GRANDDAUGHTER . WE 'RE STILL CONNECTED TO THEM , DANA , EVEN AFTER THEY 'RE GONE . LOOK AT ALL THE PRESENTS . [ Melissa ] DANA , QUIET . THEY 'LL HEAR US . THIS ONE 'S FOR ME . YOU WISH . THAT 'S FOR BILLY , YOU DOPE . THIS HAS GOT TO BE IT ! IT 'S GOTTA BE " HOTEL CALIFORNIA . " SHH , YOU 'LL WAKE EVERYBODY . - I WONDER WHAT THIS IS ? - I DON 'T KNOW , BUT I GOT ONE TOO . [ Mom ] YOU DON 'T HAVE TO SHAKE IT , DANA . YOU CAN OPEN THOSE NOW . THANKS , MOM . YOUR GRANDMOTHER GAVE ME A CROSS JUST LIKE THAT WHEN I WAS ABOUT YOUR AGE . IT 'S PRETTY . IT MEANS GOD IS WITH YOU . HE 'LL WATCH OVER YOU WHEREVER YOU GO . [ Knocking ] DANA ? HI . SORRY . THERE 'S A DETECTIVE HERE TO SEE YOU . I 'LL BE RIGHT DOWN . I KNOW IT 'S EARLY . NOT A PROBLEM . INTERESTING TIDBIT ON MR. SIM . WHAT ? BANK DEPOSITS , LARGE ONES- - $ 30,000 A POP . THREE IN THE LAST 18 MONTHS . ALL THE CHECKS HAVE BEEN MADE OUT TO HIS WIFE . THE LAST ONE WAS DEPOSITED YESTERDAY , APRES-MORT . WHERE 'D THE CHECKS COME FROM ? A PHARMACEUTICAL FIRM IN CHULA VISTA . DR. CALDERON ? YES ? I 'M AGENT DANA SCULLY WITH THE F.B.I. , AND THIS IS DETECTIVE KRESGE WITH THE SAN DIEGO POLICE DEPARTMENT . - WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU ? - WE 'RE INVESTIGATING THE DEATH OF ROBERTA SIM . - WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN ? - YOU KNEW MRS. SIM ? HER DAUGHTER , EMILY , IS A PATIENT HERE AT OUR CLINIC . WHAT WERE YOU TREATING HER FOR ? SHE 'S A SUBJECT IN ONE OF OUR CLINICAL TRIALS . WE 'RE DEVELOPING GENE THERAPIES FOR SEVERAL BLOOD DISORDERS . EMILY SUFFERS FROM A RARE TYPE OF AUTOIMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA . SHE 'S A VERY SICK LITTLE GIRL . WHAT 'S HER PROGNOSIS ? [ Calderon ] I REALLY COULDN 'T SAY . THESE ARE ONGOING DOUBLE-BLIND TRIALS . IT COULD BE YEARS BEFORE WE HAVE ANY RESULTS . YOU 'VE BEEN PAYING THE SIM FAMILY SOME COMPENSATION FOR THIS ? EMILY 'S A VERY SPECIAL CASE . WE WERE LUCKY TO FIND HER . - HOW DID YOU FIND HER ? - HER FATHER BROUGHT HER TO OUR ATTENTION . THEN WHY ARE THE CHECKS MADE OUT TO HER MOTHER ? HOW SHALL I PUT THIS ? THESE PAYMENTS ARE A GESTURE OF GOODWILL TOWARDS MRS. SIM . SHE WASN 'T COMPLETELY CONVINCED THAT OUR EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT WAS THE WAY TO GO . SHE WANTED TO PULL EMILY FROM THE PROGRAM ? SHE FILED THE PAPERWORK , BUT HER HUSBAND LATER WITHDREW IT . DR. CALDERON , DID YOU EVER PRESCRIBE ... DORITRIPTAN INJECTIONS TO EMILY DURING THE COURSE OF HER TREATMENT ? NO , I PRESCRIBED THEM FOR THE HUSBAND ... WHEN HE MENTIONED HE WAS SUFFERING FROM MIGRAINES . [ Knocking ] MARSHALL SIM . YOU 'RE UNDER ARREST FOR THE MURDER OF ROBERTA SIM . WHAT ? WHERE 'S EMILY ? ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND ? YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT . I DIDN 'T KILL HER ! IF YOU REFUSE TO REMAIN SILENT , ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU IN A COURT OF LAW . [ Kresge Continues ] WE 'LL GET YOU RIGHT IN THERE . OH . WE 'LL JUST GET YOU BUCKLED IN HERE NICE AND SAFE , OKAY ? YOU LIKE THAT , HUH ? I 'LL SEE YOU SOON , OKAY ? [ Car Engine Starts ] EVERY YEAR , MY HUSBAND INSISTED ON PUTTING THE ANGEL ON TOP OF THE TREE BY HIMSELF . A MAN 'S WORK . YES . DANA , CAN YOU GIVE ME A HAND IN THE KITCHEN ? YEAH . WHAT 'S UP ? I NEED YOU TO TELL ME WHAT 'S GOING ON . WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? I 'M HERE , DANA . YOU 'RE A MILLION MILES AWAY . I THOUGHT YOU CAME TO SEE THE FAMILY . I DID . I THOUGHT THIS OTHER THING WAS RESOLVED . I THOUGHT YOU CAUGHT THE GUY THAT MURDERED THAT WOMAN . WE DID . THEN IT 'S ABOUT THE GIRL , ISN 'T IT ? MOM TOLD ME . [ Closes Door ] YOU REALLY THINK MELISSA HAD A BABY ? YES , I DO . SHE CALLED YOU FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE TO TELL YOU THAT ? SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING THAT PARTNER OF YOURS WOULD SAY . IT DOES NOT MATTER WHERE THAT PHONE CALL CAME FROM . WHAT MATTERS IS THAT THERE IS A LITTLE GIRL WHO NEEDS MY HELP . THIS ISN 'T ABOUT ANY LITTLE GIRL , DANA . IT 'S ABOUT YOU . IT 'S ABOUT SOME EMPTINESS , SOME VOID INSIDE YOURSELF THAT YOU 'RE TRYING TO FILL . I DON 'T EXPECT YOU TO UNDERSTAND , BUT I AM NOT GONNA JUSTIFY MY MOTIVES- - DANA ? THERE 'S A TELEPHONE CALL FOR YOU . HELLO ? [ Kresge ] MERRY CHRISTMAS , AGENT SCULLY . GOT A LITTLE PRESENT FOR YOU . MARSHALL SIM JUST CONFESSED . HE ADMITTED TO BEING AT THE HOUSE THAT MORNING ? I GOT A SIGNED STATEMENT RIGHT HERE . WHAT ABOUT THE WITNESSES THAT PLACED HIM AT THE DOCTOR 'S OFFICE ? - I GUESS THEY WERE MISTAKEN . - MAYBE THEY WEREN 'T . - WHERE IS HE NOW ? - COUNTY LOCKUP . [ Scully 's Voice ] THEY IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES ? THEY SAID THEY WERE HIS LAWYERS . HOW LONG WERE THEY HERE ? TEN , FIFTEEN MINUTES TOPS . DAMN IT ! [ Door Opens , Closes ] - WHEN DID YOU GET BACK ? - JUST NOW . YOU 'RE JUST IN TIME . I WAS ON MY WAY TO THE NEIGHBORS ' . MOM AND TARA ARE ALREADY THERE . WHAT HAPPENED ? MARSHALL SIM , EMILY 'S ADOPTED FATHER , IS DEAD . THEY MADE IT LOOK LIKE A SUICIDE , JUST LIKE HIS WIFE . OH , MY GOD . DO YOU KNOW WHO DID IT ? NO . DO YOU THINK IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT LITTLE GIRL ? I THINK IT MIGHT . DANA , I HAVE TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING . LOOK AT THE DATE ON THE BACK . DOES MELISSA LOOK PREGNANT TO YOU IN THAT PICTURE ? IT 'S ABOUT FOUR WEEKS BEFORE THE GIRL WAS BORN . BILL , THAT DOESN 'T PROVE ANYTHING . MELISSA DIDN 'T HAVE TO GET PREGNANT TO HAVE A BABY . THERE 'S IN VITRO FERTILIZATION . THERE 'S SURROGATE MOTHERHOOD . DANA , LISTEN TO YOURSELF . YOU 'RE CREATING THIS WHOLE SCENARIO TO FULFILL A DREAM . - WHAT DREAM ? - TO HAVE A CHILD . LOOK , I UNDERSTAND . I KNOW THE NEED . GOD KNOWS TARA AND I TRIED FOR YEARS . BUT MAKING THIS GIRL INTO MELISSA 'S DAUGHTER IS NOT THE WAY . YOU 'RE ONLY GOING TO END UP HURTING YOURSELF . [ Doorbell Rings ] HI . HI . I 'M HERE TO SEE DANA SCULLY . MAY I ASK- - I 'M SUSAN CHAMBLISS FROM THE COUNTY . IT 'S ABOUT THE ADOPTION . HI . THANKS FOR COMING IN ON CHRISTMAS EVE . NOT AT ALL . I DON 'T UNDERSTAND . I MEAN , I THINK I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHY YOU 'RE REJECTING MY APPLICATION . IT 'S NOT MINE TO ACCEPT OR REJECT , DANA . WE ONLY MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE JUDGE . BUT AT THIS POINT , I 'D ADVISE AGAINST YOU BECOMING AN ADOPTIVE PARENT . YOU 'RE A SINGLE WOMAN WHO 'S NEVER BEEN MARRIED ... OR HAD A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP . YOU 'RE IN A HIGH-STRESS , TIME-INTENSIVE AND DANGEROUS OCCUPATION . ONE THAT I SENSE YOU 'RE DEEPLY COMMITTED TO , AND ONE WHICH WOULD OVERNIGHT BECOME THE SECONDARY PRIORITY ... TO THE CARE AND WELL-BEING OF THIS CHILD . I 'M NOT SURE THIS IS A SACRIFICE YOU 'RE PREPARED TO MAKE . WELL , IT 'S ONE THAT I 'VE GIVEN A GREAT DEAL OF THOUGHT TO . I MEAN , TO BE HONEST , I 'VE STARTED TO QUESTION MY PRIORITIES SINCE I WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER , AND I FEEL LIKE I 'VE BEEN GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE . EVER SINCE I WAS A CHILD , I 'VE NEVER ALLOWED MYSELF TO GET TOO CLOSE TO PEOPLE . I 'VE AVOIDED EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENTS . PERHAPS I 'VE BEEN SO ... AFRAID OF DEATH AND DYING ... THAT ANY CONNECTION JUST SEEMED LIKE A BAD THING . SOMETHING THAT WOULDN 'T LAST . BUT I DON 'T FEEL THAT ANYMORE . I KNOW YOU 'RE A TRAINED PHYSICIAN , AND ARE AWARE OF EMILY 'S MEDICAL CONDITION . I WANT TO STRESS TO YOU , DANA , EMILY IS A SPECIAL-NEEDS CHILD . ACCORDING TO HER DOCTORS , HER CONDITION IS INCURABLE . SHE REQUIRES CONSTANT CARE , BOTH MEDICAL AND EMOTIONAL . THE GOOD NEWS IS YOU HAVE FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE OF GRAVE ILLNESS . THE BAD NEWS IS ... YOU 'D HAVE TO RELIVE IT THROUGH THE EYES OF A CHILD . I REALIZE THAT ... AND I FEEL LIKE I 'M READY . WE 'LL REVIEW YOUR FINAL APPLICATION ... AND MAKE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS . OKAY . I WISH YOU LUCK . MERRY CHRISTMAS . MERRY CHRISTMAS . I 'LL SHOW MYSELF OUT . DANA ? MELISSA ? I DIDN 'T KNOW ANYBODY ELSE WAS UP . I COULDN 'T SLEEP . HOW COME ? YOU WORRIED ABOUT QUANTICO , OR WHO GETS THE MOST PRESENTS THIS YEAR ? I GUESS I 'M AFRAID I 'M MAKING A BIG MISTAKE . I COULD TELL DAD SURE THINKS I AM . OH , WELL , IT 'S NOT HIS LIFE , DANA . YEAH , I KNOW THAT . BUT WHEN I STARTED MED SCHOOL , IT FELT SO RIGHT . IT JUST SEEMED LIKE THAT 'S WHERE I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE . THEN ... BY THE TIME I GRADUATED , I JUST KNEW IT WAS WRONG . BUT NOW THE F.B.I. FEELS RIGHT , AND WHAT IF THAT 'S WRONG TOO ? THERE IS NO RIGHT OR WRONG . LIFE IS JUST A PATH . YOU FOLLOW YOUR HEART , AND IT 'LL TAKE YOU WHERE YOU 'RE SUPPOSED TO GO . GOD , YOU SOUND LIKE A GREETING CARD . I DON 'T BELIEVE IN FATE . I THINK WE HAVE TO CHOOSE OUR OWN PATH . JUST DON 'T MISTAKE THE PATH WITH WHAT 'S REALLY IMPORTANT IN LIFE . WHICH IS WHAT ? THE PEOPLE YOU 'RE GONNA MEET ALONG THE WAY . YOU DON 'T KNOW WHO YOU 'RE GONNA MEET WHEN YOU JOIN THE F.B.I. YOU DON 'T KNOW HOW YOUR LIFE IS GONNA CHANGE , OR HOW YOU ARE GONNA CHANGE THE LIFE OF OTHERS . [ Tara ] HEY ! GOOD MORNING . HEY , SLEEPYHEAD . MERRY CHRISTMAS . DID SANTA COME ? SANTA 'S STILL HERE . SHE ALWAYS HAD TO BE FIRST UP . COULDN 'T WAIT TO GET TO THOSE PRESENTS . MERRY CHRISTMAS . ENOUGH PLEASANTRIES . I 'M DYING TO KNOW WHAT 'S IN THIS BOX . I 'VE BEEN WAITING FOR MONTHS ! LET ME OPEN IT . [ Doorbell Rings ] THIS ONE 'S FROM CHARLES . FROM CHARLES ? DON 'T OPEN ANYTHING . I 'LL BE RIGHT BACK . EXCUSE ME . [ Man ] F.B.I. COURIER FOR AGENT DANA SCULLY , PLEASE . I 'M AFRAID I NEED AGENT SCULLY 'S SIGNATURE , SIR . I NEED YOU TO SIGN HERE , PLEASE . MERRY CHRISTMAS . MERRY CHRISTMAS . [ Mom ] WHAT IS IT ? IT 'S THE DNA TESTS ON EMILY SIM 'S BLOOD . WHAT DOES IT SAY ? IT SAYS DEFINITIVELY THAT MELISSA IS NOT EMILY 'S MOTHER , BUT THAT THEY FOUND STRIKING GENETIC SIMILARITIES BETWEEN EMILY AND MELISSA . SO MANY THAT THEY RAN A TEST ... AGAINST ANOTHER SAMPLE THAT THEY ALREADY HAD . - WHAT SAMPLE ? - WHAT ARE THEY TRYING TO SAY ? ACCORDING TO THIS ... I AM EMILY 'S MOTHER . [ Child ] I MADE THIS !

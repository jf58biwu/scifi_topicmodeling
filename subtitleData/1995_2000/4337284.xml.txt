 COMMENTARY : Here we go again . This is Matt Groening . - This is Paul Calder , editor . - John DiMaggio . I do a few voices . Eric Kaplan , writer . - I 'm David Cohen , executive producer . - I 'm Brian Sheesley , director . I 'm Rich Moore , the supervising director of the series . And also the hottest man in drag at the Rough Draft Halloween party . God bless you . JINGLE SINGERS : Call Robo-Rooter if you flush a towel We also help with an impacted bowel JINGLE SINGERS : Robo-Rooter COMMENTARY : Did we pitch that down ? Or did someone sing that low note ? - Probably John . - I can 't remember . That reminds me , Paul Calder , editor . It 's a digital thing we can do . I didn 't mean to use that as a segue . Pitching things down and up without slowing or speeding up . How is it possible ? Paul is given Colorforms and puts the episode together from those . LEELA : Look at you . - You 've become a fat sack of crap . - Sack ? Bender , your beer belly 's so big your door won 't close . - And that doesn 't make sense . - You 're coming ... COMMENTARY : A rare copping to the illogicalness of the situation . ZOIDBERG : For some reason , I 'm frisky as a squid ... COMMENTARY : But we 'll find out for some reason . That is Billy West as the amazing Dr. Zoidberg . Here comes one of the dirtiest , but subtlest jokes on Futurama . There it is . What the ... ? AMY : Who 's up for a steam ? Crustaceans don 't like steam . I 'll work out with the Nautilus . - What up , Dr. Z ? - Yo , yo . What 's up ? Give up the rock ! COMMENTARY : All right ! - Speaking of dirty scenes . Dirty scenes ! - A lot of loving care went into this . - We spent hours . This scene has been very useful to us throughout the series . In other episodes , when we had nudity , the censor complained . We 'd point to this and say , " You let us get away with more . " Completely naked . That guy wasn 't naked . You could see his shorts . Can you guys from Rough Draft redo that so he 's naked ? Right on it , Mr. C. [ MAN LAUGHS ] Eric Kaplan , what 's the biggest inspiration for this episode ? - Lf you lie , I 'll be onto you . - I was gonna say something else . - The Star Trek episode " Amok Time . " - Yes . Correct . It 's also a parody of evolutionary biology as an explanation of human behavior . I 'm on board with that . I think more people are familiar with " Amok Time . " Those were the two things I was thinking of . We 've never used that fin again on Zoidberg . - He 's never in a mating rage . - We ought to bring that back . - He 's got so many onetime features . - Dr. Zoidberg is every sea animal . That 's Randy . [ MAN LAUGHS ] I love Randy . Years from now we see him in a jewelry store . He doesn 't hold a job . Randy was in one of the first episodes . He was originally an old man in the mob . LISPING : I did him like this because he needed to be heard . - That was his name ... - It changed . His actual name in the script of episode 1 03 is Man in Mob . We didn 't originally picture such a nice personality . - A moment I will cherish . - You made him worth bringing back . Hermes and Zoidberg hate each other for a reason no one knows . For jokes , I think . FARNSWORTH : Let me give old Zoidie a sedative . - Much better . You can remove these . - I 'll do it . LEELA : Look out ! Stop ! BENDER : Moron ! There 's the problem . Give it to me straight . Is it fin rot ? It 's fin rot , isn 't it ? Relax , my chitony chum . COMMENTARY : Vocabulary lesson there . - Chiton , a hard , shell-like substance . - He 's made of chiton . FARNSWORTH : A time when his behavior 's run by the brain in his rump . - There 's one thing we can do . - I 'll boil the water . COMMENTARY : Has his male jelly been mentioned yet ? - Yeah , I believe it was . - We may have missed it . FRY : Oh , baby , I 'm there ! - Do you understand " invertebrate " ? It 's not the word I care about . No need to pack pants . Let 's roll ! Dr. Zoidberg said I should hold these . [ ZOIDBERG GROWLS ] [ GROUP SCREAMING ] BENDER : Moron ! COMMENTARY : Was that an act break ? - Yeah . That 's cool . Look at that . Fabulous sand in this episode . Especially this shot . Dave Lee , effects animator , came up with that sand . - Didn 't you invent the black dots ? - The speckling in the sand . Photoshop . - Another technical question . - A thing called Photoshop . Graduated cylinder . FRY : That 's how you say " Zoidberg " ? You didn 't have to point out his speech impediment . You 're looking less nuts . COMMENTARY : This whole sequence is one background reused for every scene . One thing we can do with the digital camera is take pieces and repeat them and make them further back closer in the foreground and repeat them as long as we have to . Reusing a background ? I 've never heard of that in a cartoon before . That palm tree looks different each time . - You must have done something to it ... - What ? The double ? The double . This is not 3-D . This was hand-animated by Anthony Agrusa . - Dropping names like crazy . - I tell you . - All three are still on the show . - Watch your feet . ZOIDBERG : Who 's the tough guy now , Vinnie ? COMMENTARY : He 's a bad guy , Zoidberg , I think . [ GROUP CHUCKLING ] This design based on anything in particular ? Any real Roman arenas ? Objection ! Leading questions . [ GROUP LAUGHING ] - This one , I don 't know the answer . - Well , Spartacus . - The training arena . - Yeah . Bender keeps trying to take over this episode , but never succeeds . [ GROUP CHUCKLING ] - Yeah . What happened , John ? - L ... Hey ! - This show felt like a Billy affair . - I didn 't write it ! ZOIDBERG : How do I look ? - Like whale barf . Then the illusion is complete . They 're here to watch the erotic display . COMMENTARY : When Bender 's not the star of the episode everything he says is a joke . That 's what our characters are like . That 's what Zoidberg is like in a normal episode . He gets to butt in and say funny things . - That 's a good role . - Everybody knows their job . BENDER : ... shooting DNA at each other to make babies . It 's offensive ! COMMENTARY : Bender is disgusted by very basic things about humanity . FEMALE : So not interested . I 've heard that before . COMMENTARY : What 's up with the " graw , " fool ? ZOIDBERG : What 's the point ? Why 's he still alone ? He 's a loser , that 's why . The lobster equivalent of Fry . I can get any girl , any time . I 'm just too busy . [ GURGLES ] Edna ! Edna , it 's me , Zoidberg . Remember ? From high school . My face was covered with barnacles . COMMENTARY : That 's us . EDNA : I didn 't know you were back in town . I heard you became a rich doctor . COMMENTARY : Tress is the best . - Tress is the best ! [ GROUP LAUGHING ] Tress is the best , man . EDNA : I 'm just going through a lot of things right now , and ... Look , I carry more eggs than other females . I owe it to our race to pick a mate stuffed with jelly . - Maybe a rock star . - Or a doctor ? I 'm sorry . You 're just an inferior male specimen . Nice seeing you again . COMMENTARY : I hate that . - Ouch . Especially when they have those claws . [ GROUP CHUCKLING ] ZOIDBERG : ... with a puny claw like this . Did you see those guys ? They were giant claws with bodies . - You didn 't smell as bad . - You 're right . My stink gland is weak . Smell ! [ GROUP CHUCKLING ] COMMENTARY : He 's got a stink gland . - What part of the ship is this ? - This is the second time we see it . - The lamenting room . This room appears again in the underwater episode . - First introduction of Sean . - The Atlantis episode . But here 's a new room that you 've never seen before . [ GROUP LAUGHING ] - It 's got a candy machine in it . - It 's a game room-slash-Iounge ... - Coffee . ... slash-schoolroom . What did we call this in the script ? - Auxiliary fake room number three . - Cheat rooms . - Cheat room . - The room you save your game in . [ GROUP LAUGHING ] There 's a similar thing in The Simpsons . I should wait for a Simpsons DVD . They had a thing called the mystery door . A door which was either a closet or the basement depending on the episode . And the little-seen rumpus room in the Simpsons ' house . ZOIDBERG : I don 't know . You just want to talk . I just want to talk . COMMENTARY : Another example of the same actor talking to himself . It 's Fry and Zoidberg , both Billy West . ZOIDBERG : You seem malnourished . Do you suffer from parasites ? Yes . Thanks for noticing . COMMENTARY : Second mention of parasites in the script . [ GROUP CHUCKLING ] ZOIDBERG : How was your day ? Well , first I got up and had a piece of toast . Then I went to the store . And ... Look , she won 't shut up . It 's normal . Just nod and say , " Uh-huh . " - Uh-huh . Uh-huh . - And then you threw an octopus . It 's crazy , but when you talk this way your obvious deficiencies seem ... less obvious . Your genes seem less detrimental . You even stink more . COMMENTARY : You can get nice acting on this creature with little humanity . [ GROUP CHUCKLING ] The point gets across . This is a Red Primate , which is designed after a Red Lobster . An old W.C. Fields line . I like Bender 's joke , returning the guy 's heart . It 's from Six of a Kind , a W.C. Fields story . - It is ? - Yeah . - What 's the real one ? - You just hear the end of it . He 's doing a routine and he 's telling how he got the name Honest John . Someone left an artificial eye on a table and he returned it . Ever since , he 's been known as Honest John . FRY : No . Must be some alien emotion . He said some dumb stuff . He 's a nice guy . Really . Fry 's been telling him what to say . And Fry 's a ... - Do you have idiots on your planet ? - Fry ? Words of such beauty came from the blowhole of that hideous alien ? Yeah . What ? Look , never mind the words . Zoidberg 's a doctor . A doctor , honey . COMMENTARY : Look at that fancy wallpaper . That 's not wallpaper . It 's sand texture . - It 's all made of sand . - The whole planet is made of sand . That 's really a cheap joke there with the flounder . [ GROUP LAUGHING ] That 's like Fish Police . I mean ... . Fish Police was a deeply meaningful show . Now the show has just gotten dirtier than anything previously on TV . - Oh , yeah . - It shouldn 't be sexy , but it is . [ MAN CHUCKLES ] Lobster butt . EDNA : I know Zoidberg 's words were yours . Teach me to love , you squishy poet from beyond ! I 'm flattered . If I did it with a mudbug , you 'd be on the list . COMMENTARY : Freaky mudbug . - What 's a mudbug ? - A mudbug is a crayfish . - Okay . Horrible mucus to make the scene even pleasanter . [ GROUP CHUCKLING ] We do what we can . ZOIDBERG : Fry ! It 's not how it looks ! COMMENTARY : Such great acting . [ GROUP LAUGHING ] Look at his eyes . Now his eyes are gone . I 'm glad some people picked up on that . [ MAN CHUCKLES ] This is a digital component we do , changing color like that separating the levels out . Here 's Dave Herman . He did this voice out of nowhere when we did a reading where actors read the script . He did this crazy voice . No one could understand a word he said . We told him to do the same voice . It was so funny we didn 't care what the words were . Do something Hungarian , really loud . It was like an uncle or something . This is one point in a script that a director gets , reads and cringes . We try to shoot around crowds , but in this round arena we have hundreds in the stands that have to be full . A lot of pencil mileage went into this . LEADER : ... I 'm a desirable male groaning with jelly . COMMENTARY : Groaning with jelly . We should have subtitles to show what he 's saying . " One of the friends must die ! " I love that . That was one where he did a few takes and was so crazy 1 0 times we were like , " We can 't use that . " But it was in the back of my head and it wormed its way in . The 1 0th time , we 're like , " We have to use that . 'One of the friends must die . ' It 's in my head . " LEADER : Edna , have you anything to say ... ? COMMENTARY : I like how he says Edna . " Edna . " Today I got up and I had a piece of toast , then I brushed my teeth ... - Shut up ! - I love you , Fry ! COMMENTARY : Note the chemistry between Edna and the priest . Having guessed what animal I was thinking of you have first choice of weapon . Similar to the weapons in Star Trek except for the last one . LEADER : And you , doctor ? - I choose my claws . I want to chop him here , in the gonads . Nobody correct him . Fry , I 've never asked for anything before ... . When it comes to the ninth round ... COMMENTARY : I like the hangdog lobster in the second row . He 's just bummed out . [ GROUP CHUCKLING ] LEADER : Please rise for the national anthem . [ GROUP CHUCKLING ] COMMENTARY : That 's the best . When we had the rough animation screening , called the animatic I was laughing so hard , I broke down crying when the anthem came on . That 's one of my favorite moments in Futurama , I 'd have to say . - That 's some furious animation there . - Yep . Who did that ? - Drop another name . - I don 't know who did that . - I know that Albert boarded it . - Yeah . - Albert Calleros ? - That would be Calleros . Those boards were long , complicated and hilarious for the third act . LEELA : Go , Fry ! Die with dignity ! COMMENTARY : There 's a shot that 's coming up here . Right here . It 's a 3-D wall spinning around and a 2-D , all the characters on the foreground and background on a cylindrical wrap . - Pretty simple to do or ... ? - Actually , yes . Scott Vanzo , our technical director , pointed it out to us . - Scott Vanzo . - Scott Vanzo . SPECTATORS : Claw Plock ! Claw Plock ! Claw Plock ! Fellow fish monsters . I don 't want to question your stupid civilization ... COMMENTARY : Futurama takes a stand against multiculturalism here . FRY : He 's my friend . Though a woman has come between us we 'll remain friends . And do you know why ? One reason . COMMENTARY : There was a big debate about this . [ GROUP LAUGHING ] Blood , no blood . Arm , no arm . - Arm , leg . - Why did we do this ? - It 's horrible . What were we thinking ? - Folks , we 're so sorry . Why did you buy this DVD ? Return it . [ GROUP CHUCKLING ] That was the first of many body parts Fry has had cut up over the years . My problem was that he seems to have a lot of energy afterwards . It doesn 't bother him that much . BENDER : Oh , my God ! The frenzy ! Oh , the greatest experience in life and I missed it . I 'm sorry , doc . FRY : Ow ! Ow ! COMMENTARY : Why was this an insert ? - That was a note of mess . - That 's why we added that . - Yeah , that 's right . Must be some reason why he 's not keeling over . - This is crazy . - There 's lots of dirty , crazy stuff . - What 's that on Bender ? - A lot of bird crap . - A little guano . - Is it guano ? Pigeon guano ? - I 'll tell you what that means . - I know . You don 't have to tell me that . I 've been to the Southwest . - I thought guano was only from bats . - That 's bat guano . [ GROUP LAUGHING ] - That would be sea gull guano . - Sea gull guano . ZOIDBERG : I felt things I never felt before . Love , jealousy , passion for disemboweling . I owe it all to you . I pronounce the operation a success . COMMENTARY : This was tricky boarding this part to keep the arm a surprise . - Ah ! - Ow ! ZOIDBERG : For you , my friend , anything . FRY : Ah ! My legs ! ZOIDBERG : All right ... Third time 's the charm . [ SPLATTING ] COMMENTARY : Just a splat ! - That was a late edition . Right before it went on the air . - Really livened things up . - Awesome ! - Really added some charm . - Splat city . [ GROUP LAUGHING ] - Took it over the top . - What a gorgeous , nauseating episode . That episode doesn 't hold back . It goes all out . - Male jelly . - Passion for disemboweling . One of my favorites , no doubt .

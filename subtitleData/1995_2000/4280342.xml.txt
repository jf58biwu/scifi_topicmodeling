 Oh , man . What did he say ? A natural heat vortex . That 's what he called it . And he was right . See out there ? The cool breezes from the ocean mixing with the steaming ' desert air ... make , like , a big ... wind collision thing , and that 's what runs the windmills . You figured that out by yourself ? Not me . Jarod . Did it by watching them . Without moving a muscle , they can just ... hover in the vortex . He just sat in this spot all day . Just eating ' Pez and taking in the hawks . I 'm surprised your Dr. Dolittle didn 't try talking to them . Well , it wasn 'tjust the birds he was into . He really dug these . He 'd , like , be throwing dust at ' em all day , saying he was figuring the ... updrafts and the air currents and stuff . - Righteous , huh ? - Lovely . Oh , Jarod . What are you up to now ? Whoo-hoo . ! That was great ! Congratulations . You just beat the gauntlet . This is so cool . Well , Jarod , the audition 's over . You want the job , it 's yours . Want it ? I could stay up here forever . Hee-hee . ! Well , Mr. Matthews , for an ex-fighter jock , you 've done pretty good for yourself . Well , Yeager sells batteries . I 've got SkyVionics . A buck 's a buck . The end of the Cold War nearly killed most of the defense contractors ... yet your stock 's up , what , 17 % last quarter alone ? - Eighteen . - Whoo ! Maybe I should buy me a little . Well , with the Scimitar chip about to be approved ... maybe you should buy yourself a lot . - Is that a Draken ? - Yeah . Uncle Sam 's not the only one with a shrinking purse . We 're testing the Scimitar in planes from the R.A.F. , the Israelis . Hell , even the frogs sent over a Mirage . - You seen Dixon ? - Yeah . There 's the wild man now . He 's a good pilot , but punctuality 's not his thing . He 'll probably miss his own funeral . - You 're late . - Yeah , but what an entrance . - So , how 'd he do ? - Only took him one week to do three weeks ' worth of tests . - That makes him the new king of the mountain . - You serious ? He scored 34 % . - Ah , it was no big deal . - Oh , it is when Dix here only scores 33 . Even so , I want you to shadow this hotshot . He 'll show you everything you need to know about the new system . Then you can teach him how to beat the gauntlet . At the end of the week ... I 'll decide who gets to be my wingman for the Pentagon test . No pressure . So , Jarod , I heard you ran some flights for the Agency . - Who was your point man ? - Andrew Sterling . Original secret agent man . Yeah , I ran some TR-1 recons over Singapore for him back in the ' 80s . North Korea . Right . Well , I can 't believe I 'm actually flying for Manhunter Matthews . He 's the second-best pilot I 've ever seen . And who 's the best ? You 're looking at him . - How does it feel up there ? - Ah , smooth . I can 't wait to get this baby back up . Body by F-16 . Brains by yours truly . The Scimitar chip makes any plane 's onboard computer work 10 times as fast as the others . Well , in this game , speed means life . Glad to see Tom 's finally got himself some A1 jocks to keep up . Quality control problems ? - Mr. Lawson . - Depends on who you ask . I 'd appreciate the latest hydraulic specs . - You 're beginning to sound like a broken record , Lieutenant . - Quick way to fix that . Yes , ma 'am . Stereographs . They say there 's a picture in there somewhere ... but I 've never been able to see one . A penguin at the Sphinx . A penguin riding a camel . A penguin on a Nile barge . Now that 's something you don 't see very often . I could look at these things for a week . Nothing . Well , it 's all in the ocular muscles . The key is you focus on the poster ... but you move your primary eyesight eight degrees to the left . What did you do ? Invent these things ? Mmm . Not officially . - Jarod Wright . - You 're Ronald Collins 's replacement . - LieutenantJanice Gant . - Nice to meet you . Penguin , huh ? Penguin . I see you met Miss Congeniality . Toughest S.P.O. in the field . Ah . So she 's the special projects officer . Blue-suiters sent her to keep tabs on us . Which reminds me . Clearview Ridge . Natural heat vortex . Wind shear up the wazoo . You lean on the throttle anywhere near there , and she 'll blow a gasket . Clearview Ridge . Thanks for the tip . Don 't tell me what you see , Jarod . Tell me what you feel . Tell me what you feel . I feel tired . My legs hurt . Push with the pain . Focus . We need details . This helmet 's too tight . It 's hot . I don 't like this . Why can 't I get a bike that actually goes somewhere ? Sydney . Sydney . Just a minute . - Hello , Mr. Hollis . How are you ? - Fine . Super . Great . - Can I help you with something ? - Why do you need a second phone line ? It 's for my modem . I 'm uploading something . Oh . One of those . - One of those ? - Sheep . People who don 't mind giving up their privacy . - Baa ! - Excuse me ? It 's too late . They know . - They ? - The black helicopters . The gray men . Like those SkyVionics people . I 've been on that place . Been out there since World War II ... doing some very cockamamy things . What 's in the case ? - Memories . - Pictures ? Something like that . Why would you want a computer if I gave you a perfectly good TV ? See ? Universal remote even . Runs everything but your life . Yes . But they could be watching you through the TV . No reverse-imaging device . I inspected it . I also took the liberty ... of programming this to skip channels with subliminal mind control . Well , that was very considerate of you , Mr. Hollis . You aren 't uploading filthy pictures , are you ? Well , that depends on how you define filthy . It came down the linejust a few minutes ago . Jarod . This better be good , Syd . Mr. Raines ? How did he find out about him ? Must be the disks from the digital simulation archive . Do you think he realizes what it means ? We 're talking aboutJarod . If he doesn 't now , he soon will . He is a genius . You can stretch it ... bounce it and copy newsprint with it ... and it comes in its own plastic egg . Yeah . See , the egg is like a symbol of this stuff 's birth , you know ? Its being . It 's notjust putty . It 's whatever you want it to be . Oh . Well , why would they call something this versatile silly ? Would you buy something called Versatile Putty ? I don 't know . But I 'll buy this . I 'll buy 100 . Cool . Hello . You must beJarod . We 'll be very happy to help you with that . The view is better from the inside . Thought I smelled some smoke . Everything seems to be A-okay . Good . Never figured you for a pilot . Well , if it makes you feel any better , I 'm not really a pilot . Oh , right . I 'm Jimmy Hoffa . Could have told me . Man likes to know when he 's about to have his throat ripped out and fed to him . It didn 't seem important . Important ? Does that look important ? Fleets of these behemoths , like crazed flying monkeys ... terrorizing U.S. citizens from Seattle to Miami . Terrorizing ? Halcion gas . C.I.A. created it in 1971 . - 1969 . - I knew it . You 're one of them . Would you stop , please ? This is a mass hallucinogen . This is pretty potent . Well , not anymore . I cut it with 50 % oxygen . Hell , your dentist has stronger stuff . Even so , I caught an accidental whiff . Thought I was Eleanor Roosevelt for the best part of an afternoon . - Your point being ? - Remember the medfly ? No such thing . Lock your doors and bolt your windows , amigo . The exterminator 's coming , and his name is SkyVionics . - SkyVionics ? - Merchants of death . Trust me . I 've been a clown in that circus ... and it 's anything but the Greatest Show on Earth . That 's quite a collection . The only thing we have now to hang up there is you , the SkyVionic boys ... since we don 't have a base anymore . What 's your poison ? - Excuse me ? - What 's your drink ? Uh , I was raised on optimized nutritional supplements : hearts of palm , wheatgrass , asparagus mixed with tomato . Virgin Mary , celery garnished . Uh , could you make it two , please ? I 'm expecting company . Mm-hmm . What the hell do you think you were doing up there ? - Practice makes perfect . - You know what I 'm talking about , Wright . Clearview Ridge . I was retracing Ronald Collins 's last flight . Two Virgin Marys . I hope this is your poison . - You knew I 'd come after you . - Toughest S.P.O. in the field . At least that 's what they tell me . So , Lieutenant Gant ... why is the air force so concerned with a civilian flier ? You 're testing a system that 's designed to protect military pilots . It 's my job to make sure it 's safe . And I 'm up for wingman on Friday 's test . I don 't fly avionics I 'm not familiar with . It 's my job to know what I 'm getting into . True . Now , from what I understand , Collins had plenty of time to eject . Time , yes . Ability , no . His record in the Gulf says otherwise . Well , between me and you and that wall of fame ... Collins didn 't eject because he blacked out . What are you saying ? Put it this way . His drink of choice was not a Virgin Mary . - Is that true ? - You can take my word for it ... or steal my report from the Special Projects Office in D.C. Now that would be impossible . Look , not even his wife fought the allegations , and they cost her his pension . Two SkyVionics employees place Collins right here in this very bar ... - the night before the crash . - Who ? Lawson , for one . Who else ? Tom Matthews . Nice flying , Jarod . Bring it on home . - You weren 't kidding when you said you were a quick study . - Ah . Beginner 's luck . We 're making a big announcement after the test . Scimitar 's going commercial . By the year 2000 , that Scimitar chip 's gonna be on every airliner in the country . I feel safer already . Well , I just want you to know I 've been talking to corporate types about you . You 're our best flier , hands down . - But ? - But I gotta give the test to Dixon on Friday . I understand . You don 't want a repeat of the last test . We won 't . This time no test pilot 's gonna let me down . Ron Collins could have flown circles around you two . Instead he hit the bottle . I 'm surprised you missed that . I called him on it the morning of the test . He said he was fine . So it wasn 't a mechanical failure . The residual alcohol in his blood ... caused him to black out when he pulled too many g 's . Collins was flying a safe plane . I 'm sure he was . Is your mom home ? Mom ! You were with Ron in Saudi Arabia ? Your husband ... he saved my tail on the third night over Baghdad . When I heard about the accident , I ... Well , I tried to make my way here as soon as I could . I want to tell you how sorry I am . Me and a couple of the guys , we petitioned the C.N.O. ' s office ... about getting Ron a posthumous Gulf War commendation . What 's wrong , Mom ? Nothin ' . That 's great . That 's really great . Have you had supper yet ? You 're saying Jarod left this for us . When I tried to save this picture of Mr. Raines ... it unzipped an executable that created this program . And I 'll be able to communicate with him and see him ? Through his encryption , yes . I don 't want Miss Parker to find out about this . Uh , wait ... wait a minute . Uh , you want to play political Parcheesi with the ice queen , you go ... You go right ahead , but I 'm not dancing in that minefield . No way . You are afraid of losing your job . I 'm afraid of losing my life . Hey . You get hot dogs and macaroni for dinner every night ? I wish . It 's quite a view , huh ? That 's Orion , the hunter . - And that one 's Pegasus . - The winged horse . That was Dad 's favorite . I can name a lot of stars . Dad and I studied ' em . We went to see ' em in the desert the night before he left . Really ? - Just you and your dad ? - Shh . Mom never liked it when we snuck out late . We never told her . Hey , Jarod . Don 't forget . Tomorrow I need you to play bogey in the Draken . - Where is it ? - They 're prepping in number 27 . - That 's two hangars down . - Thanks . How many hours you logged in one of those ? Well , actually , this 'll be my ... first . Looks likeJarod 's been busy . This image was taken last night by one of our KH-11 satellites . - That 's La Grange . - Mm-hmm . - La Grange ? - One of the Centre 's private , unmarked airstrips . - That 's somewhere in Virginia , right ? - Right . It 's just outside of D.C. This shot 's just before 2 : 00 a.m. Nothing up the sleeve , right ? And presto . - Draken jet . - Draken . Oh . Parked there for three hours until ... - Poof . - He landed there in the middle of the night , undetected ? And three hours gives him perfect time for a visit to D.C. Why Washington ? LieutenantJanice Gant reporting . S.P.O. video record . Collins / Matthews dogfight simulation . Scimitar 2 , come in . Do you copy , Hammer ? Uh , roger that , Manhunter . System is hot and working great . Let 's try that again at Mach 1.8 . - Throw in a shoulder roll for good measure . - Come and get me , Manhunter . Coming in for the kill . Say your prayers , Hammer . Pull out of the roll , Collins . Pull out of the roll . You 're headin 'down . Level off . Level off , Collins . ! Collins , punch out . ! Level off , Collins . You 're going down . Get out of there . Punch out . ! Punch out . ! Collins . ! Collins . ! You couldn 't punch out ... because Matthews sent you up in an unsafe plane . If you don 't understand , we 'll just try again . Okay ? Very good . Listen to me , Doctor . Listen to me , Doctor . The kid asks about his father again ... tell him Daddy loved him very much ... and Daddy died in a plane crash . That 's not exactly a lie . Are we clear ? " Are we clear ? " - Mr. Hollis ? - Get me out ofhere . Mr. Hollis . Mr. Hollis . It 's okay . It 's Jarod . It 's Jarod . Jarod . Are you all right ? Nightmare . Shouldn 't you be uploading something ? Hiroshima . This is you . Greatest Show on Earth . I was part of something that ... should have never happened . I helped do this . You couldn 't have known . Ignorance is a poor excuse ... for murder . Stop this car . Stop it or I 'll ... 140 channels , nothing on . Yeah . My wife says I 'll die with one of those things in my hand . Hmm . - Broke ? - Defective . Hey , you 're the mechanical whiz . The specs say there 's a failure rate of 0.4 % . So ? So , I 've done my own calculations , and I 've come up with a failure rate of ... 3.1 % . Sounds like a bad chip . You 're the expert . - That 's a Scimitar chip . - Mm-hmm . And when it fails , whole plane 's affected . Altitude controls ... infrared sighting ... ejection systems . Ronald Collins didn 't punch out the night of the crash because he couldn 't . 3.1 % . Is that what a man 's life is worth at SkyVionics ? He wasn 't at the Tail Fin Bar drinking the night before the crash . He was out in the desert . He was stargazing with his son . Why did you lie ? I , uh ... I warned Matthews about the chip ... but he said the ratio was acceptable . " 3.1 is nothing against the bottom line . " Is that why you doctored the voice recorder ? Yeah . Matthews wanted to keep Gant out of the loop . He said we 'd all be raking it in once he closed the commercial contracts . Jarod . Put yourself in my shoes . I already have . Who is that man ? It 's no one , Jarod . It 's no one . Answer the question , Sydney . Who is he ? And what does he know about my father ? Sydney , I 'm not here . I 'm glad we can finally talk again . The plane crash is " not exactly a lie . " What did he mean by that ? I only know him as Mr. Raines . But listen , Jarod . I 've been searching here ... and I 've discovered one thing . Your father was an aviator . An aviator who had flown with ... - Jarod ? Jarod ! - Sydney ? Sydney ? Sydney ! Sydney . Damn . Well , somebody inside cut us off . That 's right . Come with me . Lieutenant Gant , it 's Jarod Wright . There 's something that you really should see . Uniforms-R-Us ? I need a rush job . I thought we had an understanding . And now ... this . Well , he talked me into it . He forced me . He 's not that good . I can make it up to you . And how do you propose to do that ? Jarod 's transmission used an old ARPA connection from the early Internet days ... when it was still a Defense Department system . I 've zeroed in on his location . It 's a beginning . - Lieutenant . - Sir . We should be starting in about 30 minutes , sir . Good . Been waiting six years for this Scimitar system to impress us . - Better be now . - Trust me , sir . After what I saw last night ... it 's gonna be a real eye-opener . What do you mean you can 't find Dixon ? I 'm sorry , sir . There 's no answer at his home . He 's probably on his way . All right . You tell control to confirm that all systems are on line . - Yes , sir . - And call Dixon 's house again . Nothing . The natives must be getting restless . You up for a dogfight ? Me ? I was born for this moment . All right . You know the drill . Just like we practiced . Don 't break Mach 1 . Don 't get fancy . We 'll be open-miked into the tower , so remember ... we 're on the air , and everything 's on the line . I wouldn 't have it any other way . All right . Here we go . Scimitar 2 , why don 't you make like a bandit ? Roger that , Manhunter . First stop , radar reflection . Scimitar 's advanced avionics will enable Eagle 's R. W. R ... to initiate lockup twice as fast as competitive systems . As he evades , Scimitar will predict his angle off-tail ... and lock on a real missile . In the air , speed is life , and Scimitar is speed . Bang . - You 're dead , Eagle . - I always wondered what that felt like . - Okay . - Let 's try this again . Mach 1.8 . Let 's really test the system . Roger that . Jarod , we 're off the speaker . What do you think you 're doing ? - You want to look good in front of the brass , don 't ya ? - You follow my lead . I really couldn 't do that . You see , there 's a failure rate of 3.1 % on any promise I make . Ronald Collins wasn 't so lucky . Come and get me , Manhunter . All right , General . Watch and learn . Sir . - What the devil is this all about ? - The truth , General . I 've lost flight control . Eagle , repeat : I 've lost flight control . That 's because your Scimitar chip has failed . Just like the one in Ronald Collins 's plane . Scary , isn 't it , Tom ? I can 't punch out ! I can 't punch out ! I 'll tell you how ... if you tell me the truth . What the hell are you talking about ? Well , then you 're gonna suffer the same fate as Ronald Collins . Do you copy , Manhunter ? I had to make good on the quarter ! You killed a good man , and then you blamed it on him . I didn 't want that to happen ! I 'm sorry ! He was a friend of mine . I didn 't want that to happen . Get me out ofhere . ! Enable your infrared sighting . I.R. ' s on . Disable your radar warning receiver . - Check . - Pull the eject handle . It won 't work ! It still won 't work ! Oops . I almost forgot . Cool . Ladies and gentlemen , SkyVionics Radio ... has reached the end of another broadcast day . This is Eagle , signing off . Let 's go . Yee-haw . ! This is so cool . Matthews . The government wants a refund . Oh . ! Yes ! Mom ! Mom ! Come look at this ! Well , I guess it 's not easy living next to a nutcase . You 're not crazy , Mr. Hollis . I believe everything you 've told me . I 'm still not sure about the Eleanor Roosevelt thing . There is another piece of information that I 'd like you to keep your eye on . What 's that ? It 's in Delaware . Blue Cove . A place called the Centre . Now , that 's the only map you 're ever gonna find it on . It 's a dangerous place . People should be made aware , if you know what I mean . Oh , yeah . This is real ripe . I 'll spread the word . I 'm counting on it . - Good luck . - You too . Uh , Jarod . I don 't know what it is you 're after , but I hope you find it . Miss Parker . You 're Miss Parker . - That 's right . - Hmm . - What is it ? - Silly Putty . Do you have a mirror ? " Late pilot cleared of error . " Nothing . I 'm beginning to dread that the Parker killer instinct wasn 't hereditary . - I 'll find him , sir . - Let me be perfectly clear . Jarod is not some minor inconvenience ... for you to pad your Centre expenses with . I understand , Mr. Raines . We 're ready for you , sir . Help yourself .

 I came in search of something I did not believe existed . I 've stayed on now , in spite of myself In spite of everything I 've ever held to be true . I will continue here as long as I can . As long as you 're beset by the haunting illness which I saw consume your beautiful mind . What is this discovery I 've made ? How can I reconcile what I see with what I know ? I feel this was meant not for me to find , but for you to make sense of , make the connections which can 't be ignored . Connections which , for me , deny all logic and reason . What is this source of power I hold in my hand , this rubbing ? This simple impression taken from the surface of the craft . I watched this nibbing take its undeniable hold on you , saw you succumb to its spiraling effect . Now I must work to uncover what your illness prevents you from finding . In the source of every illness lies its cure . Who 's there ? He 's been quiet for the last 36 hours , but he doesn 't sleep . There 's activity in the temporal lobe we 've just never seen . It won 't allow his brain to rest or shut down . You can 't sedate him ? Yes . We slow him down for short periods and put him in the neuro ward . It 's the only way we 're able to run tests . But over time ... his brain is going to just die . Agent Mulder ? Agent Mulder , can you hear me ? Do you know who I am ? It 's Skinner . Walter Skinner . Can we get him outta here and get him some fresh air at least ? Let him go ! He can 't breathe ! Let go , Mulder . I don 't want to hurt you . Come on , let him go . Stay there , Mr Skinner . No , it 's all right . Just let me get up . 5mg of haloperidol , IM ! - I want him in five-point restraints ! - Yes , sir . My God . What happened here ? They said you speak English . - What do you want ? - I 'm sorry . You must wonder who I am . I am Amina Ngebe . I 've come to see your discovery . I asked that no one be told about it . Nor that I 'm here . Yes . Well , it is still a secret , but a well-known one , I 'm afraid . Dr Merkmallen called it the African Internet , God rest him . You knew Dr Merkmallen ? I too am a professor of biology at the university . But hardly one qualified to say what must have gone on here . Well ... I was working late last night by lamplight and , uh , I saw a man who vanished ... and then they just swarmed . You must not let the men know what happened to you last night - the vanishing man , none of it . Why ? They are animists , believing nature is vengeful . They 'll take this as a sign to leave what you have found alone , a bad omen . - Caused by the ship out there ? - Caused by God ... who will be much less helpful than those men it we are to continue this work . The truck ! He 's gotta get to a hospital ! Hospital ! OK ? You see ? Another warning . Agent Mulder . I wanna help you . I don 't know what to do . I don 't have much time . Can you write ? I feel you slipping away from me with every minute I fail here . What are the elusive meanings I cannot see that are hidden here ? If I could understand it , know how it affected you , learn how to use its power to save you . What is it ? Look , I 'm sorry , I don 't speak your language . - Perhaps you need an interpreter . - Stay away from me ! Are you gonna hack me up in front of my driver ? You 're under suspicion already . - You 're the murderer here . - Murderer of who ? - Dr Merkmallen ! - I murdered no one . But I won 't be sent away from here . I know what we 've got . This craft that 's come ashore ? Its extraterrestrial origins ? - You don 't even believe in that . - Nor do you . But here we are . I 'm here only to help my partner . Then let me help you . To read it . I 've spent my life looking for what 's out there , the answer to what theologians have pondered for millennia . The key to everything . To life itself . I 've already been threatened by men in Washington about what I know . How long would your secret keep if you were to send me away ? What is it ? It is a sea of blood . - Michael Kritschgau . - It 's six o 'clock in the morning . I don 't know if you remember me . My name 's Skinner . - I 'm here to talk to you about Fox Mulder . - I 'm listening . He 's in a serious condition , Mr Kritschgau . He has to talk to you . I got nothing to say to the man . You know , I had a job ... with a government pension coming . And two years ago . Fox Mulder asked me to do him a favour - blow the whistle on Uncle Sam 's UFO propaganda mill . And all it got me was this swanky address . Look , he doesn 't have much time . Hey , I 'm not a doctor . What is it you think I can do for him ? All I know is that he asked for you . Can he even recognize me ? To be honest , I don 't know . Agent Mulder ? His brain is on redline . He 's on haloperidol just to stay on the monitors . - Haloperidol ? - He becomes violently agitated . He won 't speak or sleep even when he 's medicated . There 's activity in part of his brain they 've never seen before . Was his ... ? Was his what ? I started to ask you a question about his prior mental state , but he anticipated it . Second time . Agent Mulder ? He claimed to be hearing voices . I might know why Agent Mulder asked for me . - Doesn 't mean I can do anything for him . - What just happened ? I think he responded to a question that ... I didn 't ask . I don 't know how long we can keep him . We could be held responsible . You asked me to come down here . You better be prepared to accept the responsibility , Mr Skinner . - You 're going to inject him ? - No . You are . With a thousand milligrams of phenytoin . I 'm not injecting him with anything , not till after I talk to his doctor . - He 's being given the wrong treatment . - You 're not a doctor . But I 've seen his condition . Who do you wanna trust ? Seen it where ? In a study . There 's something like ESP called " remote viewing " . - Whose study ? - The company 's . The CIA , Mr Skinner . Extreme subjects went into arrest , their minds working harder than their bodies could sustain . They became all brain . Phenytoin was the only thing that could slow the electrical impulses to a normal rate . Agent Mulder knew about this . That 's why he asked for you . They 're coming . - Who last saw him ? - I 'm looking . - I find a patient missing , and nobody knew ? - I just came on . Sorry . Fox Mulder ? He 's restrained . He 's not in his bed ? No . How many times can I say it ? He 's right here . - He wasn 't here when I came in . - No , I just found him down the hall . - I just got him back into bed . - Who are you ? I 'm his boss . And hers . I don 't know how he could get up or pull all this stuff out . Well , I hope someone 's calling a doctor and making a report on this . - He has got to remain in this bed . - I 'll stay with him . Agent Fowley , why don 't you see it you can help her ? That 's an order , Agent Fowley . She knows . - You can read her mind ? - Yeah . - We gotta act fast . - The doctor 's on his way . - No doctors . Get me Scully . - I don 't know where she is . Look , I know you 've been compromised . I know Krycek is threatening your life . Blackmailing you . You don 't think I can trust you , but it 's not you that I need . - Then who ? - Him . Kritschgau . Ask him to prove it . - Prove what ? - What 's causing this . It 's a brain abnormality . It 's how you 're able to read minds . What 's causing this is alien . That 's why my doctors can 't help me . I don 't believe in aliens . I think you know that . I do . That 's why I need you . The work here is painstaking - a slow and tedious piecing together . It appears to be a craft , its skin covered in the intricate symbols you and I both saw , but which I now understand are part of a complex communication . Dr Barnes has broken some of the symbols into letters using an ancient Navaho alphabet , and though it has helped to uncover some of what 's here , it has also made for greater confusion . 0n the top surface of the craft . I 'm finding words describing human genetics . Efforts to read the bottom of the craft have been harder . Our workers were scared away by phenomena I admit I can 't explain - a sea of blood , a swarm of insects . But what little we have found has been staggering - passages from the Christian Bible , from pagan religions , from Ancient Sumeria . Science and mysticism conjoined . But more than words , they are somehow imbued with power . I 've ignored warnings to quit this work , remaining committed to finding answers , afraid only that our secret here won 't last , and that I might be too late . I have something to show you . More pieces of the puzzle . I couldn 't believe it . Thought I was making it up in my head , that it could not be true . - What ? - What this is . What the symbols spell out is a passage from the Koran . Qiyaamah . The day of final judgment . On a spacecraft ? Teachings of the ancient prophet Mohammed ? I found more , too . 24 panels . One for each human chromosome . A map of their makeup , maybe a map of our entire genetic makeup . A complete human genome . I mean , it 's like ... it 's the most beautiful ... intricate work of art . It is the Word of God . You 're wrong . There is no God . What 's out there on the water is only what we call " God " , what we call " creation " . The spark that ignited the fire that cooked the old primordial soup . Made animate from inanimate . Made us . - I believe he is mad from the sun . - Mad ? I 'm perfectly sane . Because today I understand everything - beginning and end , alpha and omega , everything in between . It 's all been written . - But the word is " extraterrestrial " . - You 're sick , Dr Barnes . You need to get off your feet , lie down . You think you 're going to take the credit ? This is my discovery . I 'm only here to help my friend . You can 't help him . You 're wasting your time reading it . - It has power . - It is power . The ultimate power . Your friend just got too close . No one leaves here before me . We developed this to test remote-viewing capabilities . It works much like a card trick . Tap the monitor where the saucer appears when it appears or when you think it does . All right ? Who ya gonna call ? Now . Now . Now . Now . Now . Now . Now . All right , Agent Mulder , fine . You 're at about 5 % accuracy . - I 'm assuming that 's low . - Yeah . At the CIA , a high degree of ability was 20 % . 25 % was extraordinary . - But I see them in my head . - You saw his ability . You pointed it out . Well , our tests show that some people have psychic ability , sure - I mean , ESP , clairvoyance , remote viewing - but it was never attributed to aliens . You don 't wanna believe . You 're not looking hard enough . One more time . Faster . He 's ahead of the images . He 's anticipating them . They 've come back ! They were dead ! They 've come back to life ! The ship - it brought them back to life ! - We have to get to the police . - That is where I 'm going . This is the road to Abidjan . Stop ! That was him . That was the man I saw in the tent . In the road . Some truths are not for you . Are you all right ? Oh , God . What are you doing ? You were cold . I was just feeling to see if you were still alive . - What happened to you ? - To me ? You slammed on the brakes . There was a man . - That 's right , in the road . - No . He was right there , sitting right where you are , in your seat . The men were right . This is a bad sign . A sign to give up . - Turn us around . - Not back to the beach . No . I 'm going home . Agent Mulder . Agent Mulder . I don 't know if you can hear me , but we 're gonna try to get you outta here . - AM nurse is on in a minute . We gotta move . - I don 't think he 's in any shape . I 'm gonna hit him pretty hard . Maybe we can get him on his feet . - What are you doin ' ? - I know what you 're doing . - I 'm trying to help him . - No , this isn 't about him . It 's about revenge on the government for destroying your life . I was destroyed to protect what Mulder knew all along . Now he 's the proof . He 's the X-File . We can 't keep shooting him full of drugs . It 's gone too far . How far should it go ? How far would Mulder go ? - Hey ! What 's going on here ? - Let me see your hands . Hands ! Step away . - What the hell do you think you 're doing ? - What am I doing ? What are you doing , sir , with this ? I want you to face the wall . Do you hear me ? Face the wall . - Let me explain . - What was this man given ? - What was in this syringe ? - Phenytoin . Let me tell you what it does . How much did you give him ? What dosage was this ? Let me tell you why we did it . He 's going into seizure . Watch his head . Mr Mulder ? Hold him . Hold him . Dr Barnes ! Dr Barnes ? I 'm so sorry . I know what 's happened to you . I know what you 're suffering from . I 've been sitting back and watching . I know you know . I know you know about me . That my loyalties aren 't just to you , but to a man you 've grown to despise . You have your reasons , but as you look inside me now you know that I have mine . Fox ... Fox , I love you . I 've loved you for so long . You know that , too . And I won 't let you die ... to prove what you are , to prove what 's inside you . There 's no need to prove it . It 's been known for so long . Now we can be together . Where is he ? Is he still in the hospital ? - Where have you been ? - Is he still at Georgetown Memorial ? - You can 't get to him . - Do you know where he is or don 't you ? He 's in the neuro-psych ward , but it 's no good . Agent Scully ! I have been on a plane for 22 hours . I have to see him , Then I think you should know what you 're gonna see - if you can even get on the ward . There 's been some trouble . - What kind of trouble ? - I got this man Kritschgau involved . Kritschgau ? It 's a long story , but it ended badly . They 've got Mulder under security now around the clock . I take full responsibility . - Responsibility for what ? - He can 't even communicate , Agent Scully . They won 't treat him because they don 't know what 's wrong with him ! They said he was dying . I had to do something . - He 's not dying . - I 'm afraid it 's true . He 's not dying . He is more alive than he 's ever been . He 's more alive than his body can withstand . And what 's causing it may be extraterrestrial in origin . I know . But there 's nothing to be done about it . They 're going to deny you access . Maybe as his partner , but not as his doctor . He 's alive ! He 's come back to life ! Holy Mother of God ! Hello ? Please . I need to see him . I 'm begging you , please . Thank you . Mulder , it 's me . I know that you can hear me . If you can just give me some sign . I want you to know where I 've been . What I found . I think that if you know , that you could find a way to hold on . I need you to hold on . I found a key ... the key ... to every question that has ever been asked . It 's a puzzle ... but the pieces are there for us to put together . Mulder ... Please . Hold on . I made this !

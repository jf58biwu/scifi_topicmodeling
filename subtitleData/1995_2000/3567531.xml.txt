 Previously on The Pretender . Problem at the Centre ? My father 's been at his desk at 7 : 00 for the last 35 years . - Two weeks in a row , he 's a no-show . - That 's weird . Thank God you 're back , Daddy . Who the hell are you ? Mr. Lyle ? - [ Mr. Lyle ] Brigitte is the new Cleaner . - Am I in The Twilight Zone ? We thought it would be a good idea to have Brigitte ... provide assistance in the capture ofJarod . [ Broots ] He 's been barking orders and all the smart people seem to be following them . - [ Sydney ] Maybe he 's part of the Triumvirate . - [ Broots ] The Triumvirate ? [ Miss Parker ] What the hell would they be doing here ? Seizing power - Their appearance certainly would explain ... your father 's disappearance . Why would they make my father disappear ? [ Broots ] Because someone shot Raines . They 're not gonna stop till they find out who did . Who is Mr. Lyle ? [ Weakly ] He 's the bogeyman . The money was rerouted through the Centre 's offices in Omaha ... and withdrawn electronically . They 're double-checking the transfer records . They 're hoping it 's an accounting mistake . Jarod stole $ 15 million of Centre funds and donated it to charity . The only mistake is rubbing our noses in it . " Your welcomed and surprisingly generous donation ... " will help the organization for years to come . " The million dollars will bring much hope andjoy to the children . " God bless . Prayers be with you . Have a nice day . " I 'll get him . Please do . Jarod 's a lot more dangerous than I thought . [ Jarod ] I like ice cream . I really like ice cream . - Here you go , Jarod . - Thank you , Phil . - That 's a very interesting device . - It 's a Whee-Lo . - And its purpose is ? - Nothin ' . Just goes round and round and round . - So it chases itself in a circle . - Yep . Would you be interested in selling that for ten dollars ? - Sorry . - Fifteen ? I couldn 't . My grandpa gave it to me for my birthday . - Twenty ? - Twenty-five . Sold . Thank you . Wow . [ Man ] Hey , kiddo . Got some burger , some fries , gonna set you up nice here . Okay , sir ? - Dad . - Hey . [ No Audible Dialogue ] I 'm gonna be right back . Okay ? [ Sighs ] [ Man ] How you doin ; Scooter ? Dewey , you know , you shouldn 't come around here . How else are we supposed to get an ice-cream cone ? Freaky weather . Must be a hundred degrees in the shade . You look good , Scott . - What do you want , Nick ? - It 's not what I want . It 's what I need-you . Oh , you know , no . Not this time . - Opportunity knocks . - Oh , really ? 'Cause your last opportunity cost me seven years of my life . - [ Lid Slams ] - Geez , come on . Ten months I 've been out of prison . I just got my son back , okay ? I 'm not interested . Get interested . - [ Boy ] Dad ? - Shawn , go wait out front . I 'll be right there . Go on , Shawn . You do what your daddy says , okay ? - But - - Just go . Please . I see your dilemma . The deal is , one job and you and I are history . - Why don 't you get Martinez ? - Dead . He said no . [ Scott Sighs ] Crew ? The three of us , plus one . And who opens the safe ? Trinney 's sending some guy in from Brooklyn . One R.H. Cross . - Cross ? I don 't know him . - I don 't know him either . Trinney swears by him , even though he 's only got one good arm . - A one-armed safecracker . - I 'm picking him up at 3 : 00 at the train station . We start tonight . Here . Scotty , don 't be late . Hey . - You okay ? - Who was that ? It was nothin ' . Just these guys that come back , give me a hard time . Hey , nothing 's wrong . Hey , hey ! All right , come here . Come here , give me a hug . [ Whistles ] - Train station . - Leaving town ? - Business meeting . - Yeah ? What do you do ? - I 'm a one-armed safecracker . - [ Chuckles ] - Which arm ? - That 's a good question . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ Miss Parker ] Jarod 's up to something . I can feel it coming on like the flu . After his recent brush with death ... perhaps he 's just enjoying life for a bit . Maybe he decided to take a vacation . Did you eat the whole onion for breakfast ? - [ Phone Rings ] - Broots . - What ? - Sorry you missed the party in Omaha . - Jarod . What about Omaha ? - [ On Speaker ] Whoops . Guess the Centre cut you out of the loop this time . It 's a good thing they sent a replacement . - What are you talking about , Jarod ? - I 'm talking about the blonde - 5 ' 7' ; 120 pounds , killer legs . - You 're not giving up on me , are you , Miss Parker ? - You wish . [ Man On P.A. ] Your attention , please . Announcing the immediate arrival of the Brooklyn Express ... - at Track 16 . - That 's my train . - Gotta go . - [ Phone Beeps Off ] [ Beep ] What was that all about ? That 's what I 'd like to know . R.H. - " Right Hand . " - Funny . - Don 't look around . We 're being watched . - Cops ? Listen up . I 'm only gonna say this once . The location 's changed . The new score is in Indianapolis . I 'm from Flatbush . I don 't know nothin ' about Iowa . - Indiana . - Same thing . I wrote down all the locations ... - the security codes , the whole deal . - No , no . This ain 't kosher . I need to call Trinney . You do that , you lose this . You get another packet just like it when the job is finished . - Target ? - That 's my business . I 'm gonna meet you in four days at the Hotel Argyle in New York . I 've reserved a room in your name . What 's to keep me from walking away with the whole thing ? You do that ... I 'm gonna hunt you down like I did Martinez . Then they 'll be calling you " No Hands . " That 's cold . Your attention , please . Announcing the immediate departure ... - of the Indiana Star on Track 29 . - That 's your ride . - I want you to leave this at the job . - What is it ? It 's a Hallmark card . Always send the very best . Leave it . - My tools are in there . - Buy new ones - 'cause every cop along the line is looking for a man with a bum arm ... carrying a black leather bag . I 'll take the bag and the heat . Yeah ? How you gonna do that ? See you in New York . See you in New York . [ Imitating Cross ] See you in New York . Your attention , please . Mr. Paul Johnson , please meet your party - Mr. Cross ? Call me R.H. Why wasn 't I informed about Omaha ? No , no , no . Switch those masks , please . With due respect , Miss Parker , it 's not my job ... to inform you ofJarod 's whereabouts . It 's your job to inform me . - According to your file - - My file ? Correct . According to your file , you 've had Jarod trapped ... in Las Vegas , Chicago , Washington and Florida . It seems you 've had ample opportunity to bring him back . [ Scoffs ] How would you like me to feed you my file ? There 's no reason to be defensive about your shortcomings , Miss Parker . Moving in ? Possession is nine-tenths . Now , if you 'll excuse us ... we have a meeting to attend . Oh , any progress locating your missing father ? Who says he 's missing ? Man packs his belongings and vanishes - It 's a logical assumption . You gave that paperweight to your father when you were a little girl . I thought he threw it away . I 'm sure he 's fine . He would never just leave without saying good-bye . Would he ? [ Beeping ] [ Whirring ] [ Nick ] You 're dead . And the rest of us are in handcuffs . Twenty minutes - that 's all the time we 've got ... before the security guard makes his run . You 're gonna have to work faster to bypass that second alarm . I 'm working as fast as I can . There was a day you could have done this in your sleep . - Remember them days , Dewey ? - Scooter was the best I ever saw . Sixteen years old , picking combination locks down at the Y.M.C. A ... stealing wallets and jockstraps . What did you do with all those jockstraps ? That was a long time ago , Nick . I took you off the streets . I treated you like you were my own son . Yeah . And when the heat was on , you hung me out to spend seven years ... in a federal prison . Forgive me if I don 't shed a tear about how things used to be . I think we should cut him loose . This job is gonna be difficult enough in a perfect world . I don 't need a guy with his head half in the game . I know him . You , on the other hand ... are a question mark . Should I call Trinney , get another locksmith ? Nah . Let 's try it again . [ Shutter Clicking ] - Long night , huh ? - Yeah . Let 's pick this up tomorrow night at my place . You got a pen ? I 'll write down the address . Yeah . - Oh , thanks . Uh - - Oh , uh , here . 816 Highland . 816 Highland . " To Dad , from Shawn . " Is that your son ? My life . He gave me this for Father 's Day . [ Young Sydney ] Come along , Jarod . [ Young Jarod ] Miss Parker just gave that man a present , Sydney . - Why ? - It 's Father 's Day , Jarod . She gave her father a gift to show how much she loves him . Want me to put this out on the net for you ? Oh , yeah . I want to know who he is and where he comes from . I 'll bet my pension there 's somebody out there looking for this guy . [ Scott ] The wild card is still gonna be the rent-a-cops . [ Sighs ] Man . I never thought I 'd need this again . What , you can 't open a door , you blow it off its hinges ? You never know what you might run into . Sometimes looking dangerous is enough . [ Door Opens ] Shawn ! What are you doing here ? - I live here . - No , no . You know what I mean . You 're supposed to be at Mrs. Albertson 's . I went to the shop . They said you didn 't show up today . - Oh , no , I didn 't because I was - - Actually , that was my fault . I saw some of the furniture your father built ... and I insisted we meet right away . The name is Cross - R.H. Cross . R.H. - that stands for " Right Hand . " [ Chuckles ] What 's that stuff ? Well , you - You never mind that stuff . If your probation officer catches you skipping work , you 're gonna be in big trouble . I don 't want anything to happen to us . Hey , who-who 's the father here ? I want you to go to Mrs. Albertson 's house ... and stay there till I come pick you up . - But - - Just do what I say ! [ Sighs ] Wait , wait , wait . Shawn ? [ Sighs ] Listen . Hey , hey , hey , listen , pal , I just - I just need you to cut me a little slack here . Hey , I love you . I love you too . See ya , Right Hand . It was nice to meet you , Shawn . So why you doin ' this ? What ? Why you doing this job ? You don 't wanna be doing it . Which means Avani 's holding some kind of big hammer over your head . I don 't know . I never knew my parents . Shawn 's mother passed away after he was born , and ... I was sent up a year later . You know , and they just passed Shawn around from family to family , like I was . But you got him back . And I intend to keep him . A son needs his father forever . [ Hands Clap ] Jarod . You need to finish the last simulation . I made this for you , Sydney . For me ? Do you like it ? No , Jarod , I don 't like it . And I don 't want to ever see anything like it again . Let 's get to work . [ Mr. Lyle ] Wejust received these ... from our satellite office in Indianapolis . His name is R.H. Cross . He 's a safecracker from New York . And we should be interested because - According to the office , Cross 's take was nearly a quarter million dollars . He also left this behind . According to the red notebook ... Cross is going to rendezvous with Jarod at the Argyle Hotel in New York City . Jarod would never leave such an obvious trail . Cross screwed up and left that behind . That 's quite a reach . According to security on the ground in Indianapolis , Cross was nearly caught . Brigitte , go to New York . Find Cross . I still don 't understand the significance of this . - Jarod 's sending you two a message . - Which is ? You 're going nowhere fast . [ Nick ] We 've got 18 minutes until the security guard makes his rounds . I don 't like this . That van followed us ever since we left the warehouse . The cops have made us . If they have , then they 're still following Dewey all over the city . I 've got every contingency covered . Let 's just do it . [ Ticking ] How long ? Five minutes . - You 've got three . - [ Bell Dings ] What the hell is that ? [ Nick ] He 's early . Every 20 minutes , huh ? Shh - - What is it ? - A guard . [ Clicking ] How long before you 're in ? Two minutes . - [ Whispering ] What are you gonna do ? - I 'm covering contingencies . [ Salsa ] [ Continues ] [ Continues ] I 'm in . [ Alarm Ringing ] We stole an electronic key card ? It opens the federal diamond depository in Wilmington . What are you talking about ? He 's saying there is no money , just another job . That 's what this has been about since the very beginning , right ? Twenty million dollars in raw , uncut diamonds . My source says that the stones will spend 36 hours in the vault before distribution . We move on Monday , before the offices open up ... and anyone realizes that the access card is missing . Our deal was one job . I 'm out . I 'm sorry to hear that , Scotty . Change your mind , the door 's always open . - Best laid plans , huh ? - [ Softly ] Hmm . I 'll see you tomorrow . [ Beeping ] Dewey ... this is Nick . Hey . You okay ? Oh , I 'm fine . Good . I guess this sort of thing happens ... when you deal with a piece of work like Avani . - What 's wrong ? - This is too easy . - What is ? - This . Nick , he would never let me walk out with this much on the line . I mean , not unless - You got a car ? Yeah . Come on . [ Scott ] Shawn ? Shawn . ! Shawn , answer me . - House is empty . - [ Gasps ] [ Rewinds , Beeps ] [ Nick ] I 'm really sorry , Scotty ... but there 's no way I can let this opportunity slip away . I need you . And Shawn is safe . How safe he stays is up to you . [ Machine Beeps ] [ Broots ] Intelli-research 5 pulled it off ... the national police net . [ Sydney ] Why would Jarod 's picture be on a law enforcement scan ? According to the background data , he 's suspected ... ofbeing part of a robbery crew here in the Northeast . - What did you say ? - The initial scan was sent by ... a Detective Harold Evans of the Middletown P.D. Middletown - That 's less than 100 miles from here . The question now is . What is Jarod doing ... associating with a group of street criminals ? [ Broots ] This crew is slicker than that . They have an M.O. of targeting high-profile , high-tech takedowns . Such as ? Such as payroll companies , security houses , mostly diamonds . Run profiles on all the potential targets ... within a 500-mile radius of the Centre . Everything this crew might be interested in . And I want everything you can find on this Detective Evans . If he stole a Baby Ruth when he was six ... I want to know how many nuts it had . I 've been going over the layout of the vault room . I figure we 've got a better chance of blowing the inner doors . Sounds right . What do you think , Scotty ? I want him back . I 'm here , right ? That 's what you wanted . Now you give me back my boy . Focus - for the kid 's sake . Now these doors are only reinforced steel , so we might be able - I want to know where my son is , and I want to know right now ! [ Trigger Clicks ] You pull the trigger on me , you pull the trigger on Shawn . Scotty , let him go . Where 's Shawn ? Where 's my boy ? We finish this job , you and Shawn ... will be back together again , I promise . Give me the gun . Give me the gun . [ Trigger Clicks ] Anything happens to my boy , you 'll wish I 'd killed you . [ Door Opens ] Never underestimate the father-son relationship . [ Door Closes ] Jarod , I - I told you . I can 't accept this . But I made it for you . I 'm not your father . - This card is meant for someone else . - Don 't you love me , Sydney ? We have work to do . - Smells like gin in here . - What the hell is this ? I don 't have the time or inclination to banter with you , Detective ... so I 'll get right to the point . - You got a name ? - Let 's just say , I 'm the person ... who holds your pitiful little life in her hands . Is that so ? You tell me . Go ahead . Open it . Where 'd you get these ? That 's not important . What is , is that multiple copies are in my possession . Good . You put this picture out on the police net ? So ? I want him . Can 't help you . I want him . Harold . I 'm sorry - for both our sakes . I think I know where they 're gonna hit next . [ Footsteps Approaching ] Relax your prostates , boys . I 've gotJarod nailed to the wall . Blondie 's gonna bust a G-string when she - What ? Please continue . And while you 're at it , maybe you can explain this . [ Brigitte ] I spoke to R.H. Cross in New York . He was sent to rob the Centre 's office in Indianapolis ... by a man matching Jarod 's description . - We did try to warn you about that . - And how is Detective Evans ? You had me followed . Yes , I did . I want to know everything you know ... and I want to know now . Jarod 's become part of a robbery crew . Evans thinks their next target will be ... the federal diamond depository in Wilmington . I think we should blanket the area ... - and grab the whole bunch on the way in . - I disagree . - Oh , what a surprise . - [ Sydney ] You have a better plan ? You 've tried an open-snare approach before . Jarod 's too smart to let us grab him on the outside . We let him inside the vault . We lull him into a false sense of security ... and take him clean . Why don 't we just mail him the diamonds and call it a day ? I knowJarod - the way he thinks . - Yet you still can 't catch him . - Ladies . We 'll follow Brigitte 's plan . Mr. Broots , you 'll be given complete control ... of the security system at the diamond depository . You can do that ? I suggest you visit the building and begin implementing a total lockdown ... - of the facility . - I don 't believe this will work . I think it 's time to end this pursuit ofJarod once and for all . " You can do that ? " [ Nick ] Dewey got these photos of the depository this morning ... and the key card will allow us to penetrate the outside security system . - Bodies on the ground ? - Minimal . I made the last system this morning . It 's hard-wired infrared . - Can you beat it ? - Yeah , I can beat it . We have no problem then . - Oh , no . Not now . - What did you say ? - Nothin ' . - You look a little shook-up . No . No , I 'm fine . We 're all set then ? [ Sighing ] Oh , no . [ Broots ] The colored areas represent ... access points of the depository . When the grid is red , the building is locked down . When it 's green , obviously it 's - it 's not . My guess is thatJarod and his crew will disarm ... the video monitoring system as soon as they gain entry . But it won 't matter though , because I 'm the only one ... with the password to operate the system . Very impressive , Mr. Broots . I 'm confident that Mr. Broots has covered all contingencies . Are you confident , Mr. Broots ? [ Muffled Groan , Cough ] - Here we go . - We own it . - All right , they 're inside . Let 's end this . - Not yet . Not yet ? He 's sitting there waiting for us . And knowing that gives us the upper hand - the advantage of surprise . - Your point ? - We have him , Mr. Lyle . Let 's not make another mistake . [ Beeping ] - What is that ? What are you doing ? - I could stop ... and explain it or just do it and we can get the hell out of here . The choice is yours . [ Beeping ] Jarod would never have walked in here without a plan to walk out . We stay the course . Look . You want to sit on your collective thumbs , fine . I 'm gonna do my job . I won 't allow you to compromise the situation . You gonna shoot me ? - [ Electronic Chirp ] - Done . [ Drill Powers Down ] - What happened ? - The drill bit cracked . - You got another one ? - Yeah , in my bag . - I 'll get it . - No , no , no . I 'll get it . I know where it is . - Pull out the broken bit . - Make it fast . Scotty , give me a hand over here , will you ? - Yeah , one second . I 'm nearly done . - Now . Yeah , sure . Hey ! - You open these doors . - I want Scotty 's son brought back to him . - Open the doors ! - What are you doing ? Maybe you don 't understand English . I want Shawn released . I know Dewey 's got him ... so you call him and you tell him to cut him loose . You open the door or you die . - Go ahead . - You tell him , Scotty . Nick , don 't . Shoot . You see , sometimes looking dangerous is enough ... and sometimes it 's not . Now - [ Beep , Dial Tone ] Call him . Dial . [ Beeping ] [ Line Ringing ] [ Whispering ] Come on . This is Nick . Let the kid go . Yes . Right now ! The phone . Mm , mm , mm . You should have called Trinney . - [ Mumbling ] - Scotty . You let me out of here . You know , every night for seven years ... I thought about , you know , what you were doing . And then , when I get out ... I finally get my life back , you take my son . Scotty , that was business . This is personal . Let 's get out of here . Don 't leave me in here . [ Bars Clanking ] Scotty ! Scotty , don 't leave me here . Scotty . ! Scotty ! Hey . I got two on the move . - Jarod . - Give me my gun . If you wantJarod , give me my gun . - Tell the Sweeper teams to move . - Wait . What the hell is this ? All the access points within the building , they 're unlocking . One area is still secured . Where 's that ? [ Buzzing , Clicking ] [ Clears Throat ] Shawn ? Son ? - Shawn . ! - Shawn . Shawn . - Scotty . - Yeah ? Shawn . Oh ! Oh , my God . I was , like , so scared , you know ? You , uh-you okay ? - I 'm okay . - Yeah , yeah ? You 're fine ? - You 're fine ? - Dad , don 't make a big deal . Look I hate to break this up ... but don 't you think you two should be hitting the road ? Here . Take this with you . Don 't worry . It 's money that was owed to me . Uh , you know , I don 't understand . Consider it ... an early Father 's Day present . Good luck , huh ? - Thanks . - Good luck . [ Line Ringing ] [ On Phone ] Sydney . I hope your stay at the depository wasn 't too unpleasant . No . You made quite an impression on the new regime . I hope this doesn 't end up making things harder for you . I appreciate your concern . But that 's not why I called . I 've been thinking ... and I was wondering if you ever thought ... about what it would have been like to have been my father . That was never an option , Jarod ... so I never allowed myself to even ... entertain such a notion . Well , thank you , Sydney . For your honesty anyway . - [ Handset Clatters ] - [ Coins Clank ] [ Dial Tone ]

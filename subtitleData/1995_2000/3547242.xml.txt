 Help me ! Please somebody help me ! Somebody help me ! Victim 's stable . We 're transporting her to Desert Palms . Over . Nobody knows who she is . The Andersons , they called the Security Company . They thought somebody was trying to break in their back door . Southern Highlands is a new development . There 's really not much around here . Some of my guys are talking to everybody , trying to find out what 's going on . She has severe lacerations on her feet . She was running hard from somewhere . 4X23 : BLOODLINES No skid marks , no signs of another vehicle . The engine 's running , no flat tires . Why 'd she stop ? I 'm going to take the SAE kit to Greg . You don 't want to take the statement ? Do you mind ? No . She 's ready . Thanks . Linley Parker , I 'm Catherine Willows . I 'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab . I know that you 've been through a horrific ordeal . 4-4-6 . That 's all I got . Nevada plates . Some kind of SUV.Black , I think . Can you start from the beginning ? I was , um , driving home from work . There 's hardly any traffic once you cross horizon ranch . He was tailgating . I slowed down to let him pass and he hit me . I wasn 't going to stop , but he did , so I ... . pulled over . You 're not supposed to leave the scene of an accident . He looked like a normal guy . He asked if I was okay . Apologized . He went to his car to get his insurance information . I was looking at my bumper . He punched me in the face , threw me over his shoulder . I lost my shoes . He threw me on the ground , took off my jacket , ripped open my shirt . He kept trying to kiss me on the mouth , and I kept turning away . So he bit my ear . He wanted me to look at him . He was going to kill me . He ripped off my skirt . He raped me . He didn 't use a condom . He got up to zip , and I kicked him in the groin and I ran . And the rest , I guess you know . Thank you . That was very specific . You said that you looked at him . Could you describe him to a forensic artist ? Yes What do you remember most about the face ? He had bright eyes . What about the shape of the eyes ? Almond . Tiny pupils . What about the rest of the face ? He had a baby face . High forehead , thin lips , clean-shaven . Like a crewcut ? No , like he had a regular haircut . What ? How many vacation days do you have on the books ? About ten weeks , I guess . Why ? I think you should take a week or two . I-I 'm still on the case . I just didn 't do the interview for once in my life . When was the last time you took vacation ? Never , right ? Okay . Grissom , I have some information that will be of use to you . But , before you get it , I need a decision . What ? I 'm tired of being on the fence here . Either I 'm in the lab or I 'm in the field . Which is it ? Well , as soon as you can find and train a replacement , you can be in the field . Until then , I need you in the lab . Now give . I got a CODIS hit off the semen from your victim . DNA matches a rape-murder case from a year ago . Still open ? Warrick 's pulling the file . Thanks . Victim was a 32-year-old Caucasian female , Emma Dobbins . Sexually assaulted . Cause of death , strangulation . They used her pantyhose . Where 'd they find the body ? Off of Blue Diamond Road , Southern Highlands . That 's not far from where Linley Parker was assaulted . Other than the semen , the only evidence at the scene was a shoe print- - man 's size nine . I talked to Nick . They also found a print- - size nine . Did she have a car ? A Vintage Pontiac . Registered in her name , never recovered . So apart from geography and age , what else did they have in common ? Emma Dobbins ran a movie memorabilia place downtown . My vic was a pit boss at the Palms . Emma was married . Linley Parker was single . Blonde . She was brunette . The only thing in common : the guy who raped them . There 's something wrong with the nose . Which one looks right . That one . This one ? Yeah . Now , close your eyes , and tell me everything up until the time he raped you . I 'm so sorry Look at me . Look at me . Yeah , look at me . Open your eyes . My husband keeps dropping hints about my anniversary present . Says he hopes I like calypso music . I think it 's a cruise . You don 't like cruises ? I feel guilty . Because you don 't love him anymore , or because you think he can 't handle knowing ? Sir ! Dr. Todd Coombs . Excuse me , I 'm with a patient . Honey , I told him to wait ... Crystal , what 's going on here ? Las Vegas police . Sir , we need to talk . This is insane - - you 've got the wrong guy . Well , if that 's true , you got nothing to worry about . I-I 'm going with him . No , you 're not . This is where he 'll be . I 'm gonna need a lawyer . Who do I call ? I don 't know , call Roger - - he 'll know what to do . Roger ? The victim said the car was black . Well , blue looks black at night . Single file , stop at your number on the floor . When I tell you to turn , you 're gonna face the mirror . When you hear your number called , step forward . Number one , step forward . Step back . Number two , step forward . Step back . Number three , step forward . It 's number three . That 's the guy who raped me . He 's been like that since the lineup . You know , the guilty ones always fall asleep . Dr. Coombs , my name 's Gil Grissom . I 'm with the crime lab . I 'm here to collect a DNA sample , so if you 'd open your mouth ? DNA ? I-I think I should talk to my lawyer . Well , we have a warrant , so we can compel a sample . Either way I 'm gonna get it . I haven 't done anything . The good news : If you 're innocent , this 'll prove it . Thank you . I compared the eight pairs of shoes we collected at Todd Coombs ' house to the shoe print at the crime scene . Mm-hmm . No matches . Well , he could 've ditched the shoes anywhere . Yeah , true . So , uh , what do you got , Greg ? Well , according to the DNA results , Todd Coombs is not your rapist . You 're kidding . There 's only seven out of thirteen , which means we 're looking for a sibling . I believe the semen would indicate a brother . Could explain why she picked Todd out of a lineup - - strong family resemblance . She was so sure . Dr. Coombs . You 're free to go . So that 's it ? Yeah . You people think you can do whatever you want - - come into our homes , turn our lives upside down . Who 's gonna explain this to our neighbors , our friends ? Come on , honey , let 's get out of here . You 're letting him go ? Why ? He 's not the man that assaulted you . Yes , he is . I identified him . DNA ruled him out . Then you made a mistake . That man raped me . We have some additional leads , and we 're working on them . I promise to keep you informed . I saw him . He wanted me to see his face . Linley , it was dark . You were under attack . Under those conditions ... - ... pupils dilate , it 's hard to focus . - Look at me You can 't always trust your eyes . He wanted me to see his face because he was going to kill me , and now you 're letting him go ? This is my cell phone number . Call me if you need anything . This isn 't gonna keep him away from me . What I need is protection . I need a gun . If you don 't feel safe in your home , stay with a friend . I hear you 're looking for Todd Coombs ' brother . Or brothers . I 'll work out the family tree . Yeah , I read all about it in the paper . I 'm just sorry our parents weren 't alive to see it . Hey , your brother 's being hauled in on a rape charge . Does that seem funny to you ? A little . Todd was due . Due for what ? A reality check . Most people go through life , suffer the ups and downs . Todd only got the ups till now . I 'm Roger Coombs . What 's going on here ? They 're cops - - they want our DNA . I 'm gonna need the May Hustler and a cup . That won 't be necessary . We 're not giving you anything until our lawyer looks this over . Let me tell you how this works . First things first . We do the test , and then the lawyers come in . So you two are fraternal twins , huh ? Accident of birth . You want a sample of my DNA ? What for ? It 's an ongoing investigation , sir - - a rape . Can 't discuss it any further than that . Does your route include the southern highlands ? No , I work this side of the 15 , seven hills . Were you working two nights ago ? You talked to my supervisor . you know I was . Look , I heard about what happened to that lady , and I know what you guys put Todd and Crystal through . You got something against my family ? You got something against cooperating ? Hey , how 'd it go with brother number four ? Nowhere . No Kevin Coombs at the address you gave me ; no forwarding address . PD 's following up . Willows . I can 't wait 72 hours for a gun . I need it today ! I need it now ! Linley ? Hold on . Linley , I can barely hear you . Where are you ? Fremont Street . I-I know you can help me . Just - just give me a name . Tell me where to go . Linley ? Stop ! Linley ? ! Where is she ? I don 't know . We just rolled up . Hey . There 's no new damage except for the window . Blood is probably from whoever broke the glass , not the victim . Okay , the pawn shop owner ID 'd her , she was looking to buy a gun , and she wasn 't in the mood to wait . Anybody see what happened here ? Well , the problem is that when the light show starts , everyone 's looking up . I mean , what 's the chance that this crime is unrelated to the first attack ? It 's the same guy . He 's getting rid of the witness . Who identified the wrong man . Soon as the DNA comes back , we 'll know which brother it is . And until then we wait ? Well , I got every police officer downtown looking for her . Yeah , you should have had eyes on the brothers . Yeah , in a perfect world , yeah . Didn 't you say that you were on the phone with her and you heard the window break ? Yes . Did you find her phone ? I looked everywhere . So where 's her phone ? The is dispatch . We have 20 's confirmed on Roger Coombs . Monaco Casino , last four hours . Suspect Larry Coombs at his place of employment . And Bailey Coombs , on shift , seven hills . All right , fine , fine . Search the whole house if you want to . I 'm telling you , Todd 's not here . His car was in the driveway . That 's because he took my car to the house company . You going to arrest him for that , too ? I 'm going to need your license number and a full description of your vehicle . How 'd you guys know Linley Parker 's cell was e-911 capable ? We just took a shot . She 's got a lot of new gadgets in her car , most new cell phones are imbedded with a GPS chip . Her carrier accepted the Attorney General waiver . I 'm accessing her site now . If her phone 's on , it should show up . Okay . Okay , got it . Nearest cross streets , uh , Warm Springs and Durango . That 's the middle of nowhere . Hey , Catherine . She 's moving . We got a location ! Put out a BOLO on a beige , 2004 Ford Taurus . Registration , Nevada , 3-9-6-R-G-F . The driver 's name is Todd Coombs . He 's a white male , 38 years old . I 'm on my way to the house company in Green Valley . You make a mess ? That 's your job . Unless you 've got a warrant , you can 't even touch this car . I 'm just looking . For what ? So how was Wal-Mart ? I was at the house company buying some plants for my wife , to cheer her up . Oh , you think that 's going to work ? A gesture goes a long way . Never worked for me . Hey , do you mind turning that thing off ? When the quarters run out . So when were you at the store ? Why don 't you ask my brothers ? I 've got a cousin in Phoenix , maybe he knows . Last time I cooperated with you guys , you put me in a lineup and I spent the night in jail . That 's right , that 's right . Hey , let me tell you something . Twelve hours after Linley Parker ID 'd you as her rapist , she gets dragged out of her car on Fremont Street . Now she 's missing . Then why are you wasting time talking to me ? Drive safely . Crime lab . Yeah , this is Jim Brass . Can you send a CSI to my location for evidence recovery . Two hundred fifty feet . Two hundred , still moving . Linley ! One hundred fifty feet . Linley ! - Eighty . - Seventy , sixty , still moving ! - Fifty . Okay , okay , she stopped . - Thirty feet , she 's right here . Over here ! Checked with county records . Crime scenes on a 20-acre plot . Guess who owns the property . One of the Coombs Brothers . Coombs Brother 's company . Guy 's an artist . You call that art ? Black SUV . You 're on my property ! Put the weapon down . You 're on my property ! Las Vegas Police , drop it or we shoot . Turn around . Are you Kevin Coombs ? I can see the family resemblance . Come on . 'Cause of death , asphyxia due to strangulation . Victim has a hairline fracture of the right third metacarpal with some soft tissue swelling . Defensive wounds . She was a fighter . There 's also fresh contusions of the right labia . She was raped again ? I did a wet mount of the vaginal secretion with a Christmas Tree stain . Slide 's under the scope . Sperm . If he was trying to silence a witness , why not just kill her , why rape her again ? Maybe rape was just foreplay for this guy . Maybe what he really gets off on is killing . What do you got ? Maybe a missing Pontiac Tempest . So , you were home last night ? Okay , well , doesn 't really matter . Your DNA will do the talking . You know what happens when the government gets your DNA ? Enlighten me . They put it in the database . Then they look at your driver 's license picture and then all those cameras traffic lights , parking lots , grocery stores ... they can find you . Whenever they want . Dr. Coombs . Mr. Grissom . I suppose you 're compelling a DNA sample from my brother now . We are . Why are you here ? Are you an only child ? I am . Why ? You 've got my brother in that room , he 's family . I didn 't want him to be alone . Well , what about your other brothers ? Bailey only looks out for number one . Roger and Larry , they do their best to avoid Kevin . They don 't understand him . And you do ? He 's harmless . He chooses to live alone . He lives off the grid . He spends all his time turning junk into art . Where does he get his " junk " ? Mostly from my brother 's garage . Every once in a while , Roger lets Kevin take his pick of the wrecks . Beats inviting him over for Thanksgiving , you know ? Dr. Coombs , we found a 1968 Pontiac outside your brother 's house . The VIN matched a car belonging to a victim who was raped and murdered by the same person who raped Linley Parker . And we found Linley Parker 's dead body on your Brother 's property . You guys have been wrong before . Whew , man . Guys like Brass have it easy . All they got to do is call it in . Hey , check this out . I just found it in the hose . It 's from a potted plant purchased at the house company . Confirms Todd Coombs ' alibi . You saw this ? A pin from the Palms . Linley Parker worked at the Palms . A lot of people work at the Palms . And it doesn 't nail Todd Coombs . According to the DNA , the blood from Linley Parker 's smashed window matches the semen from all the rapes . Which means it doesn 't match Todd Coombs . Or Kevin Coombs . Or any of the rest of the brothers Grimm . Linley was absolutely certain that Todd Coombs raped her . That 's not what the evidence says . Well , maybe the evidence is wrong . You can be wrong , I can be wrong , the evidence is just the evidence . Deep down , tell me you don 't think this guy is good for this . I got the DNA on the hair you lifted off Linley Parker 's body . Get this . It 's Todd Coombs . Puts him with the body . It doesn 't prove rape . I 'll have Brass bring him in . Would you strip down to your shorts , please , doctor ? Why ? I 'm going to examine your clothing for any trace evidence , and we 're going to document your body for any injuries that may have been sustained during a recent struggle . I don 't have any injuries . If you 'd like , this officer will assist you . I did not rape that woman . I did not kill her . You guys proved that and you let me go . That 's from moving boxes . Thank you . Turn around , please . That 's an old scar . I was a bone marrow donor . My youngest brother Joss had leukemia . Hold still please . Turn off the lights , would you , please , officer ? What are you looking at ? This is harassment . I 've already given you guys a DNA sample . You know that bone marrow donation you gave your brother ? I checked your medical records . His body rejected it and he died . My guess is that 's when you first found out about your unique condition . The doctors explained it . I 'm a creature of myth . A chimera . Head of a lion , body of a goat , tail of a dragon . You 're a genetic anomaly . One person , two completely different sets of DNA . State your name for the record . My name is Todd Coombs . I raped and murdered Emma Dobbins and Linley Parker . There are more , but we 'll talk about those later . How 'd you pick your victims ? They picked me . Sometimes fraternal twins , two separately fertilized eggs , develop into only one person . In effect , one twin dies in embryo , but its DNA survives in the other . That 's why the DNA from his buccal swab matched his hair but not his semen . So he had two strains of DNA in his body . Yeah , and the DNA in his semen , was evidently from his dead twin brother . You never met Emma Dobbins or Linley Parker . I didn 't have to meet ' em . You go to a bar , you see an attractive woman , make your move , she shoots you down . You go home , you masturbate . But when I see a woman who arouses me ... the whole world disappears ... except for her . She can 't say no . What a night . You guys hungry ? Want to get something to eat ? No , I think I 'm going to call it a night . Yeah , me , too . I feel ya . Get some rest . All right , I 'll see you . Hey , hey , Nick , congratulations on your almost promotion . Seriously , you deserve it . Wow . That 's really hard for you , isn 't it ? Yeah , it is . Grissom . Yes . Is she all right ? she was lucky she wasn 't on the strip . That 's highway patrol 's jurisdiction . She blew .09 . Technically , she 's over , but they just lowered the limit , so we cut her a break and didn 't book her . But we did have to call the supervisor . Well , thank you . I appreciate the courtesy . No problem . Come on . I 'll take you home . Synchro : Maxx

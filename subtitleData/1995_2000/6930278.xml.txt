 You got money for that ? I just need a little . Now , get out of here , you little pest . You can 't make me . It 's a free country . Wow ! Look who 's back . How are you doing , Jack ? Not bad . Not bad 's good enough . Hey , mister , need your windows cleaned ? How many times do I have to tell you to get out of here , you little creep ? Sure , kid , go ahead . Do it . How about taking some pictures of me this time while you 're here ? I 'm sorry , Linda . I don 't do people . Hey , Linda ! Come here and give me a hand , will you ? Maybe you could make me famous , and I could get out of this dump . Yeah , well , I don 't think that would make me very popular with your daddy . So ? He doesn 't like you anyway . Hey , there ! Stranger ! How you doing ' ? Hey , bud ! Hey ! Oh , good to see you . What brings you back here ? Well , I just want one of Kathy 's chili steak sandwiches . Well , come on in . How long you here for ? I don 't know , a couple of weeks , a month maybe , I don 't know . I got a present for you . If you come up to my place , I might even give it to you . Well , you got a couple of cold ones , I might just do that . Can do . So , is the desert treating you pretty good ? Always . Hey , hon , look who 's here . Hey ! Hey ! Jack ! Oh , I miss your cooking . Good to see you again . Yeah . Chance . How have things been going around here ? Oh , more people have moved on . Yeah ? Yeah . If they don 't start something new at the base , it 's going to turn into a ghost town . Of course , I hear Boeing 's thinking of painting airplanes or something , but who knows . Boeing , huh ? Well , listen , I got to run along , but I 'll be around . Good to see you . So I 'll see you later , okay ? All right . Welcome back . Take it easy . Hey , Ben . Hey , I come to pick up my caps . You got them for me ? You got that permit ? Well , I got it down at the hut . Well , now , damn it , Ben , it doesn 't do me any good there . All right , I 'll bring it on in to you . Well , you 've been saying that for months now . I bet you haven 't even sent in those forms I got for you . Hell , Pax , how long I 've been buying dynamite , huh ? Long before you was ever here even . That doesn 't matter . They got rules . Rules ? Yeah . Pretty soon we 'll be needing a permit to pee . Shut up and quit complaining , you half-dead old coot . Oh , that 'll be two bucks . Okay , make it fifty cents . Hi , hon . What you been up to ? Like you . Been working . Oh , yeah ? Yeah . For who ? For him . Hey , kid . You forgot your money . Thanks . Come on . Give me a hand with these groceries . Your forgot to water the plants again today . Hey ! Come on ! Come on , get out of here . If you don 't want sand in it , why bring it out here ? Look , just do me a favor . Get out of here . Can I look ? No . So , you get paid to take pictures of stuff like this ? My mom says you do . She says you 're a big-shot photographer from somewhere . And she wishes you wouldn 't come back here anymore . Oh , yeah ? It 's better down that way . You think so , huh ? Yeah , there 's a whole lot more broken stuff over there . Well , I like the broken windows . I find it interesting . Is that all ? Broken windows are easy . Maybe I should help you . Look , why don 't you just go play with your friends ? What friends ? They don 't live here anymore . Let me just show you this one place . It 's awesome . Well , I don 't know , I 'm ... What , you don 't trust me ? If you like beautiful stuff , you 'll love this . Well ? Not bad . You should see it from up on the ridge . Can you handle that ? I 'm fine . I carried a lot more than this when I used to go camping with my dad . At least it seemed like more . I was littler then . It was before the base closed . Sometimes I think my dad was the smart one in our family . I mean , when people stopped coming to the motel , he just took off . That 's what I 'm gonna do as soon as I 'm old enough . Come on . What about your mother ? Oh , she 'll do okay . I figure it 'll be easier for her if she doesn 't have me around to worry about . You know , some mothers like to worry . Yeah , maybe . You were right , this is a lot better . Here , try this . Are you kidding ? No , go ahead , take it . Before I change my mind . Here . All you gotta do is just turn this outer ring until that red needle goes between the lines . Cool . Don 't hold your finger down . It 's a motor drive . You mean it 's got a motor ? Yeah . Awesome . Hey , Stevie , come on . Let 's get out of here . Grab some stuff and come on . Come on ! Let 's go ! Come on , get inside ! Here ! Hey , where you going ? Stevie ! Hey ! Stevie ! Stevie ! Stevie ! Stevie ! Stevie ! Stevie , you okay ? Yeah ! Did you see that ? Well , come on down . No , I 'm gonna go see . Well ... Stevie ? Stevie . You okay ? Yeah . Do you think it was a meteor or something ? No , it was just some weird kind of storm . Let 's get out of here . Look at this cool rock . Maybe it 's a part of it . It 's just some kind of quartz . Come on , I 'm getting you home . Well , whatever it was , I got this really cool picture of it just as it went over . When can we see them ? Well , we can develop it as soon as we get back . But did you see that flash of light ? It 's like it smashed up against that wall of rocks . Oh , no , I think it was just a freak storm or something . Let 's get out of here . No , I want to go back and look around . No , come on . I don 't like it here . I better get you home . Shoot ! Must have got wet . Yeah , we 'll pick it up tomorrow . Come on , I 'll give you a ride back . Wow , a hunk of it busted your window . Guess what happened to me this afternoon . I don 't know , honey . What happened this afternoon ? It was absolutely the most awesome thing I ever saw . Yeah ? There was this meteor-like thing from space . Oh , yeah ? Yeah . And it exploded and everything . And I found this rock that might be part of it . Honey , I 'm sorry . I 'm really tired . Yeah , sure . But I 'm not too tired for a hug . You think you 're such a tough guy , huh ? Stop it . So you want to go out there with me tomorrow ? I could show you where it happened . Oh , honey , I 'd really like to , but I have to work tomorrow . On Sunday ? All you ever do is work . You 'd rather do that than be with me ? Oh , no , honey . I 'd much rather be with you . But we need the money . Yeah , right . Hey , city man . Hey , man , how you doing ? God , it 's good to see you . I 'm glad you came by . Look , you want a beer ? Wouldn 't refuse one . Okay . Boy , I am telling you , I am glad to be back . Yes , sir . Yeah , that 's why we 're out here . The peace and quiet of the desert . No one to tell you what to do . Yeah , or when to do it . Yes , sir . When you gonna get smart and move out here for good ? Yeah , some day , maybe . I don 't know . I guess I 'm not as content with myself as you are . Yeah , a man 's downfall . Got to prove something to himself . Oh , don 't give me that . You were there . That 's how you got your leg shot up . God knows , you told me that story enough times . Here . What 's this ? Well , look . Well , let 's see here . How cool ! Check it out . Jerry Garcia designer necktie . World keeps twisting on , don 't it ? Yeah , you 'd be surprised what 's going on out there . Oh , look , I want you to take a look at something here . Tell me , what do you think of this ? Well , what is it I 'm supposed to be looking at ? Well , I wish I could tell you . I 'm ... Yesterday afternoon , I was out at Diamond Back Ridge , and suddenly this , what I thought was a storm , went over . And when I developed the pictures ... Look at this , huh . Here , yeah , look at this one . See the way the tail is curving up like that ? It 's ... It 's kind of like it was flying . So , are you telling me it 's a plane ? No , it wasn 't a plane . At first , I thought it was lightning exploding rocks , or something . I don 't know , maybe it 's a meteor or something . Not likely . Unless it left a crater out there the size of Las Vegas . Well , I 'm going out there again tomorrow to take a look . Nature . A lot we don 't know . Oh , they 're so beautiful . Aren 't they , though ? Let me tell you , you are not going to ... Well , Carol , it 's real human hair . Can you just show me that ? It 's about time . Where 's dinner ? We 're almost out of time . There 's only 20 left . You were supposed to be here a long time ago . What did you send away for today ? Nothing . There wasn 't anything good on . We 'll fix that . Why can 't you ever get a nice movie ? Why ? I know how much this stuff turns you on . Oh , stop it ! What was that ? I don 't know . What the hell ? Did you hit him ? Pretty sure I winged him . But I want to make sure he got the message . What 's that ? What the ... No ! Roy , you scared the hell out of me . Roy ! Hey , Roy ! Hey , boy ! Boy , what do you think you 're doing ? Oh , just blowing up some stuff . Cut it out ! You 're gonna blow your fingers off . Oh , Mrs. Otis , I can handle this , thanks . Oh , sure , she can handle this . Wrecking the pool isn 't going to help us sell this place . Oh , yeah . Like somebody might be stupid enough to buy this dump . Where did you get that camera ? It 's on loan . Did you steal it ? No . Stevie ! I want you to tell me the truth . Where did this camera come from ? Okay , hang on . Hang on a minute . I 'm coming . Oh , hi . Hello . I 'm sorry to bother you . Did you know that my son had this ? Yeah . I 'm letting him use it . He doesn 't know anything about cameras . Well , maybe he didn 't before yesterday , but he 's learning ' . He 's got quite an eye for it , too . No , really . Come on , I 'll show you . Look . Stevie took these ? Well , yeah , some of them . I mean ... Here , this shot 's his . Yeah , here 's another . What is that ? Oh , that 's what I was telling you about , Mom . You know , these came out really good . Yeah . Look at this one . Wow . What 'd you do , blow it up ? Yeah . Look , I think I can get even more detail out of that . Oh . Cool . You got an award for this one . Yeah . You know what it got Grant ? The EPA saw it . He got hit with a big fine . You nearly put the man out of business . Yeah , well , I didn 't mean for that to happen . Oh , didn 't you ? Look , what I do isn 't about those images , it 's about what they represent . You think I don 't see what they 've done to this town ? They abandoned you . None of you deserved that . Look . Oh , yeah . No , this is a great one because look , you can see where the contrail goes off like that . It looks like it 's sort of pulling up right before it hits the rock . I don 't understand . Don 't you get it , Mom ? It was flying . And we saw it crash . We 've got to go back out there . Yeah . Can I talk to you for a minute ? Yeah . Here . Stevie , look through these and these . I 'm gonna fix your mom some iced tea . Look , you better look through that thing . What 's with the water ? You don 't have to bother . I 'm really running late . Okay , what 's the problem ? Look , I appreciate you taking an interest in my son . I know he 's hungry for attention , and it 's hard for a boy his age not having a father . What I 'm trying to say is , I don 't want to see him disappointed , okay ? You get tired of being here , you get into your fancy car and you go away again , but he 's stuck here . Look , I know you don 't like me ... I didn 't say I didn 't like you . Okay , but I don 't care what you think about me . I 'm just here to tell you that I think that Stevie is a cool kid . We , better , you know , get going . I gotta to get ready for work . Kath , hi . Hot , huh ? Yeah , isn 't it ? Listen , have you seen Roy today ? What ? Say that again . Oh ! Damn thing ! Will you turn the water back on , please ? I didn 't do nothing with the water . Can you hear me ? Yeah , but just barely . Yeah . Well , if you do see him , would you tell him I 'm worried about him , and tell him to come home ? Hey , it 's C.L. Roy didn 't come home again last night . You seen him ? No , I don 't know where he is . No , he ain 't been around here . Thanks . Okay . What the hell is the matter with the damn water ? When are you gonna be back from work ? I don 't know . Hey , I won 't be too late , okay ? Promise ? I promise . Smile . You sure you don 't want to follow me home ? Nah . I 'll mess around a while . Be careful . Don 't worry about me , Mom . I can take care of myself . Yeah , tough guy . Hey , kid ! What you looking for ? Hi , Mr. Culley . Nothing . Just stuff . Must be something to come all the way up here for . Well , I found this really neat rock yesterday . It might be part of a meteor or something . You got it on you ? No . Got it at home . I could tell you what it is . Might be worth something . Maybe I could even buy it from you . Of course , I 'd have to see it first . You really think it 's worth something ? Well ... Cool . I 'll go home and get it . Hey . What 's the hurry ? I got to go . Mr. Culley 's gonna buy my meteor . He says it 's worth a lot of money . I made you a sandwich . It 's in the refrigerator . Don 't forget to water the plants today . It 's a hot one today . Bring it here , boy . It 's different than before . Yeah . And bigger , too . Yeah , well , let 's take a little look-see , huh ? Look , it 's warm . Yeah . You think it 's a meteor ? Can 't say for sure . But I tell you what , I 'll give you a buck for every one of these you find . You 're kidding . All right . Ben . What the hell was that ? I don 't know , but it came from old Ben 's place . I 'm gonna go take a look . You want to ride along ? No , I got to find Roy . I 've been all over the desert looking for him . I saw Roy this morning , out by Diamond Back Ridge around daybreak , and I yelled at him , and he just kept walking . That 's not like Roy . Diamond Back Ridge ? I 'll see you later . Ben ? Ben ? Ben ? Ben ? I don 't think I 've ever seen it this hot . What about this heat , Jack ? We were just saying we 've never seen it like this . Yeah , it 's really something , all right . Listen , Pax , I got to show you something . I tell you , it was a sonic boom . You know , if they 're flying F-22s out here , maybe they 'll open up the base again , huh ? Lord , I hope you 're right . I think so . That 'd be great ! Will you give it up ? They 're not gonna reopen Bradbury unless we go to war . Oh , what does he know ? You could be right , Kathy . Listen , that wasn 't a sonic blast you heard . I went out . I saw some smoke coming from over by Ben 's place . I went to check it out , and there is a huge hole in front of Ben 's house . Is Ben all right ? Well , I don 't know . I couldn 't find him . Oh , that damn fool . I warned him about that dynamite . No , see , it couldn 't have been dynamite . Everything was intact . The house , the mine , everything . There was no pieces , no debris , no nothing . All there was , was a small crater . Just a big hole , with sort of bubbling mud in it . And at the bottom , I found that . Wow . I 've never seen anything like it . It 's warm . Yeah . Maybe it was a meteor . See , that 's what I thought at first . And it kind of looks like the rock that Stevie found yesterday . A meteor shower . Yeah . I really think we ought to have somebody take a look at it . The college at Victorville . I got a name for you . Anything show up on those pictures ? Yeah , no , the blow-ups weren 't very clear . But , I mean , there 's definitely something there . You know , when you were in the Air Force ... I mean , you must 've heard stories at least about UFOs and ... What are you suggesting ? Well , I 'm not suggesting anything . Good . Did you ever actually get out to Diamond Back and see what was out there ? Yeah , I went out there this morning . I was shooting some pictures . What the hell is that stuff ? That white ... Looks like some kind of mineral deposit . I don 't know what you 're talking about . What do you mean ? It 's all over the place . Then there 's that mound or something that ... I 'd swear didn 't used to be there . Mound ? What do you mean ? I 'll bring back the pictures when I come back . Well , here . Here 's Dr. Henderson . I 'll give him a call . Let him know you 're on your way . Back in a few hours . Hey , I can 't get through . The phone 's dead . It 's okay . You okay ? What happened ? I don 't know . It 's like a furnace out here . It 's like we drove into a damn furnace . Come on , let 's get out of here . Roy ! Roy ! Okay . Roy , okay ... Roy ? Roy ! Roy ! Help me ! Oh , God ! Roy ! There you go . Easy . Easy , Okay ... Is that a little better ? Here you go . Here . I just gotta catch my breath . Okay , well , we ... We gotta get outta here . Not to appear overly dramatic , but I think you just saved my life . Yeah , well ... You 're welcome . What are you doing ? Let go ! Stop it ! Let me go ! Let me go ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Do you see Stevie anywhere ? Probably back at the motel . He said something about selling something to Ben Culley . Maybe he 's out there . When was that ? Right before I left for work . Why , is something wrong ? Nah . Let 's see if he 's back in the motel . I don 't see his bike . Stevie ? Stevie ? He 's not here . I 'm going to call Paxson 's . Oh , great . Phone 's dead . Can you drive me over to Ben 's ? Look , he 's probably just out at Diamond Back Ridge where we were taking pictures yesterday . I 'll drive out and see if I can find him . Why don 't you just stay here and wait ? And put some of this on the sore spots . It works like magic . Damn . I ain 't never been down this far before . Do you think it 's the heat ? No . That 'll only dry it up on the surface . Ain 't no way it 's gonna lower the water table like this . Well , then what the hell 's happening to the water ? Hey , look , I just drill them . Your guess is as good as mine what 's going on down under there . Alan , come back to the store . The power just went off . Have any of you guys seen Stevie ? What are you doing here ? I thought you were on your way to Victorville . I don 't know what the hell 's going on . I couldn 't get through the pass . I am really getting worried about that kid . What do you mean , you couldn 't get through ? Well , it 's damn near 150 degrees up there ! Look , nobody can get through . Stevie ! Hey , Stevie ! Stevie , are you all right ? Easy does it ! Hey , easy , easy , easy , easy . Come on . Come on , easy . Be careful . I 'll help you down . You scared me . What are you doing up there ? I 'm gonna put your bike in the car and take you home . Your mom 's worried about you . Roy ! Roy , what are you doing ? Hey , Roy , what are you looking for ? Roy ? What 's going on ? Stevie . Stevie ! Come on . Where are you going ? I gotta get you home . Boy , the heat 's getting to everybody , huh ? You all right ? Your mom says you took that rock you found yesterday over to old Ben 's . That true ? I mean , 'cause I found one that was kind of like it , down at the bottom of a big hole over at his place . I got it right here in the back . What the ... Son of a ... Hey , Stevie . Stevie ! Hey ! Where you going ? Come back here ! Hey ... You 're pretty fast . What 's wrong , man ? You okay ? Don 't worry . You 're safe now , okay ? Just take it easy . You know , your mom 's waiting for you . Hey , hey ! Come on ! Come on . Easy , now . Easy does it . Easy does it . Take it easy . Come on . Hey , what the hell 's going on here ? Well , I 'm just taking Stevie home . Yeah , well , it seems he don 't want to go with you , so take your hands off him . Oh , look ! Grant , this has nothing to do with you , so why don 't you just back off ... I said , take your hands off him ! Hey , hey , hey ! Cut it ! Damn it , Grant ! God , this heat is making everybody crazy . Mother , take Stevie home . Come on , honey . Something 's going on around here . Yeah , and you seem to be right in the middle of it . What is wrong with you ? What is wrong with all of you ? Don 't you realize this is not normal ? It 's damn near 140 degrees out , and it 's even hotter out on the highway . I mean , a car can 't even get over that pass . Oh , yeah ? So what do you suggest we do about it , hotshot ? I just think that we ought to figure out another way out while we still have a chance . And how the hell you gonna do that ? You can 't just take these people out across the desert in this heat with no water . It could kill them . It 'll kill them if they stay here ! Look , we don 't need no city boy telling us what to do ! Come on , partner , let 's go . It ain 't worth it . You stay out of our business . I 'm telling you . Something strange is going on around here . Look , I can 't prove it , but I know something did crash out there , and because of it we are all in danger here . Oh , now , slow down , Jack . You 're leaping ' here , man . I feel like I 'm going crazy . Well , man , you sound like you 're going crazy . Well then , you explain to me why was Roy walking around in the desert looking like a zombie the other day . Oh ... And , he was messing around in the back of my truck , and I swear to God he took that blue rock out of there . And those blue flashes I keep seeing , and that explosion over at Ben 's , what was that ? And this damn heat ! I tell you , Pax , it is all connected ! Now , take it easy . We 're all on the same side here . I know they won 't listen to me , but they 'll listen to you . Not a chance in hell . That 's why people live out here , so they don 't have to listen to people . Besides , I don 't know what you 're talking about ! Well then , go out and take a look at the damn thing , will you , please ? Just ... Just take a look at it , will you ? And tell me that I 'm not going out of my mind . Please ! Okay . Okay . Okay . Pax , we 're going for water . We 've got horses about to go down . We just stopped to see if you and Kath wanted to go with us . I 'm telling you guys , you can 't get through the pass . You 're gonna have to try the back way . Look who all of a sudden is an authority . Yeah , he 's right . Now , you might be able to get through by crossing the dry lake and picking up that road that leads past Superior Salt . All right ? Let 's do it . Good luck . Good luck . Well , that 's two down and what , 20 or so more to go . Sweetie , I was worried about you . Are you okay ? You want to tell me about it ? Maybe later , okay ? Hey , you want a sandwich ? Huh ? Some juice ? Hi . Hi . You okay ? Your face looks better . How 's your hand ? Yeah . I feel fine , thanks . Good . Look ... I just wanted to talk to you about what happened with Stevie this afternoon . It 's okay . You don 't have to explain . No , but I want you to know that I didn 't hurt Stevie . I mean , I don 't know what happened , but he just spooked somehow . Thank you , you know , for going out to find him . Oh . Yeah , okay . Well , I 'm glad that everything worked out . I didn 't want to scare you , but ... I 'm , you know ... I 'm really grateful , you know , for everything you 've done . I 'm sorry . Okay , okay . Oh , God . I was really scared . I thought I was going to die . You 're okay now . What 's going on ? I don 't know . But somehow , I think it 's all connected to what Stevie and I saw out on the desert yesterday afternoon . Maybe , it 's just a coincidence . Did something happen to Stevie ? I don 't know what 's wrong with him . He 's acting like he doesn 't even know me . Yeah , he was acting the same way with me . I don 't know , but I 'm gonna drive back out there again before it gets dark . I 'll come back here later , okay ? You know , maybe you ought to throw a few things together , just in case we have to get out of here in a hurry . Stevie ? Stevie ? Oh , God ! Oh , my God ! Stevie , Stevie . Help me . Oh , my dear God . Help me . What are you ? Mrs. Otis ! Mrs. Otis ! Open the door , please , Mrs. Otis ! It 's an emergency ! Yeah ? What do you want ? Mrs. Otis , I need to borrow your car keys . Please . Hey , Pax ! I was hoping you 'd be here . You wouldn 't happen to have a cold beer on you , would you ? Don 't you wish . How far is it ? Took me a half hour to get this far . I got my climbing foot on . Just over that ridge . Don 't worry . If this heat doesn 't let up , we 're gonna start losing some good people around here . Oh , you okay , man ? Horny old mountain goat . Easy there . You okay , man ? Yeah . I 'm okay . Yeah , just testing my reflexes . Yeah . This reminds me of that time when I crashed that tester over at China Lake . Took me four hours to walk out . But , hell , it wasn 't this hot . We 're almost there . Hold it . There 's something I want to tell you . About 20 years ago , I was making a test run over the flats , and I saw something . Something I couldn 't identify . Did you report it ? Yeah , I reported it . And it was leaked , and I was made to look like a fool . So no leaks , Jack . Right over there . What is that ? I swear that thing is twice as big as it was this morning . I think it 's growing . I think we gotta get everybody out of here . Yeah . Yeah . I 'll go back to town , see what I can do . We gotta evacuate . Yeah . I 'll meet you back there . I gotta pick up some stuff . Damn . Easy , W ! ... Go on , get out of here . Hah ! Go on ! What the ... What the hell ? Hey , get out of here ! Can anybody tell me how come it 's not cooling down ? I mean , the sun 's down . It should be cooling off ! Feels like it 's getting hotter out there to me ! Okay , listen up . Will you all quiet down ? All right , all right . Quiet , please ! Please , everyone , quiet ! Everybody ! All right , now , is everybody here ? Where 's Jubby ? I think they left already . All right , now listen , I know ... I know there 's been a lot of rumors about the phones and the heat , and all the crap that 's going on around here . I was just up at Diamond Back Ridge ... I 've been up on Diamond Back Ridge a hundred times ! I never seen anything ! Now , something 's out there ! Something like I 've never seen before . It 's this thing . And it 's big . Wait , wait . What do you mean , a thing ? What are you talking about ? Well , like a mountain or a hill coming up out of the sand . Yeah , well , what 's , whatever that is , got to do with anything , huh ? How 's it making it hotter ? Well , who knows ? I don 't ! I just know if we sit around here and wait , it could be too late . Too late for what ? I think we are all in danger here ! Now , I 'm gonna take my family , and we 're gonna pack up and we 're gonna clear out till this thing blows over . Okay , now exactly what kind of danger are you talking about ? You want to know anything more , you go out and see it for yourself . If the good Lord wants to take me , he can just come and take me right here . ... and most of all , don 't panic ! Hey , folks , we 're not going anywhere . I found these guys out there , half dead . Yeah , we found them out in the dry lake bed , passed out . What happened ? Heat . Too hot . Can 't get through . We were trying to make it out the back side . I guess they had the same idea . It was like we hit this wall , this wall of heat . It 's hotter than hell out there . Must be 140 . All right ! All right . All right . Let 's not panic . We 're trapped . We 're all gonna die . Come on , honey . Let 's go home ! We can 't go home ! We can 't get out of here . What are we gonna do ? There 's gotta be a way out of here . I 'm gonna find it . Anybody want to go with me , I got room for two more . Oh , no , no , no , no , no ! Wait ! Wait a minute ! I don 't know about the rest of you guys , but I say if that mound out there is the problem , then we ought to go out there and blow it the hell up . You with me ? You 're damned right ! You 're damned right ! Let 's go ! You can 't do that . It 's too dangerous . I don 't care what you think . Now , get the dynamite . Forget it , Grant . I 'm not giving it to you . Well , you don 't have a choice . Now , I know you keep it locked up back there . Get it ! I 'm not giving you the dynamite , Grant . Now , let 's think this over . Give me the keys ... Grant ! Come on , Paxson . It 's gone too far ! Leave him alone ! You can 't do this ! Yeah , you guys have known me a long time ! Now , maybe blowing this up is the right thing to do , but don 't go off half-cocked ! I got the rolls , I got the ... You got the fuses ? Hughy , you come back here right now ! That damn fool ! Pax . You 're not gonna believe this . I found what broke my window . It was a piece of that thing that crashed out in the desert . And , Pax , it 's alive . Alive ? What are you talking about ? That thing , that strange storm , that hit Stevie and I , out in the hills , it 's some kind of a creature and it 's sucking all the water out of the earth . That 's why it 's so dry . That 's why it 's so damn hot . That 's why that mound swelled up the way it did . Creature ? No , slow down . No , look , what I 'm telling you is that , that thing out there , that mound that you and I saw , is alive . This is a piece of it . And somehow , it has the ability to transform itself into inanimate objects . You 're telling me that this is alive ? Yeah . Listen . No , wait a minute . Because it 's a coyote , so it isn 't just inanimate objects . This thing 's able to duplicate living things , too . Oh , God . Stevie . Jack ! Ellen ? Ellen ? Stevie ? After you drop them off , I want you to go home , pack up some things , and wait for me there . I don 't know what we 're gonna do , but we 'll do it together . Excuse me . Hughy has taken our truck . Now what am I supposed to do ? You 'll come with us . Now , every / thing 's gonna be fine . Oh , I hope you 're right . Roy ! Roy , are you drunk ? Hey , stop it ! Have you seen Ellen ? No , not since I dropped Stevie off . I don 't see anybody . Where is everyone ? Didn 't Pax tell you ? Grant and some of the others went out to dynamite that mound you 've been talking about . Oh , no ! They can 't do that ! Roy ? Oh , God . Ellen . Where 's Stevie ? ls Stevie safe ? Roy killed Paxson . And Grant and the other guys are gonna blow up the mound . We 've gotta stop them . No ! He 's an alien . I knew it . They 're alien duplicates of us . Come on , we 've gotta stop them . Come on . Look , there is nothing you can do for him ! This one was a mistake . What are you talking about ? We didn 't know that humans could be so violent . Ellen ? No . No , no , no . Not you . We came for the last piece . That 's all we 're missing . We only want to take what is ours , so we can leave . What about Ellen and Stevie ? Where are they ? Did you kill them , too ? They 're safe . You will all be safe if you help us . Did you have to kill Pax ? No , that was never our intention . Somehow we replicated more than the physical , and human emotions are difficult for us to control . We 're running out of time . Please help me get back . Please . Hurry up ! All right , now don 't get too close to that thing ! We need more on the hill there for the initial blast ! Hey , Chance , we need some more sticks ! Get down here ! The charges are almost set . I 'm running two lines in parallel . Hughy , the initial run is red positive ! Got it ! Come on . Let 's go . Come on . Come on ! I don 't think I can make it . Please help me . What happens if we don 't get back ? Nothing will survive of us . This place is killing us . But Ellen . What about Ellen ? If you get me back before we 're destroyed , Ellen will survive . They all will . Just yesterday , I barely knew her well enough to even say hello , and now ... She has feelings like that , too . Come on . Easy . Easy . Come on ! Let 's go ! Get this thing hot ! All right , now , get back everybody ! Take cover ! I 'm gonna blow this thing sky high ! Hey , get away ! Jack , get away ! Go back ! Hold on , Grant . That 's Jack out there and he 's got Ellen with him . Jack ! Jack , damn it ! Put her down ! Grant ! I 've got to get her back ! Put her down , damn it ! Or I swear to God , I 'll blow a hole in you ! Grant , come on . Get off . Grant , you 're not gonna shoot . You 're not gonna risk killing Ellen . I 'm not gonna ask you again ! You do it , or I 'll blow your head off ! Stop , damn it ! You can 't do this ! All right , you got five seconds to take cover ! Five ! Four ! Three ! Two ! One !
